<p>（一月十四日十六日對全國中等學校學生講）</p>
<p>根據算學敎學上幾個相對的原則——綜合與解析。演繹與歸納，推理與實騐……等等不同的理論分別形成了各種敎學方式：如（ａ）考騐式，使學生熟習所指的敎材，或藉口或藉筆試，敎師即可評定其優劣。（ｂ）復演式，使學生表演所學的結果，或背誦定理，或摘要陳述，敎師可隨時指示其是非。（ｃ）講解式，使學生聽受敎師的講演，一切以敎師的行動為中心。（ｄ）討論式，使學生公開的討論問題，敎師僅處於主席的地位。（ｅ）個別指導式，使學生各以其心得或疑問，就正於敎師，敎師乃適應需求為各個的指導。（ｆ）自動發明式，使學生各本其已有的知識，作進一步的研究，努力於自動的發明。（ｇ）分組實騐式，使學生分若干小組，從實際的觀察和測騐，以獲得必要的新知，與其他自然科學同。</p>
<p>這些都是算學敎師在敎室裏所採用的敎法，但是那一種最為適用呢？現在把它們比較一下。</p>
<p>（一）ａ，ｂ，ｃ，三式　這三式對於學生，雖說是呆板的，被動的，桎梏性靈的，似乎不宜於敎學，但若善於利用，也各有其效能。</p>
<p>（一）善用考騐式的優點：（Ⅰ）可養成學生獨立用功的習慣，不至事事依賴敎師；（Ⅱ）可使學生不畏煩難，耐心工作；（Ⅲ）可引起學生的競爭心，藉以促成其進步。</p>
<p>（二）善用復演式的優點：（Ⅰ）可藉表演的機會，矯正學生語言及文字上的誤謬。算學敎師為國文甚至外國文敎師代盡其改訂學生語言文字的義務，亦係通常不可避免的事實。（Ⅱ）可使學生在複述的練習中，漸次發展其創作的能力。如令學生對照平面三角形諸定理，述明善於立體角的諸命題。（Ⅲ）可使理解較為模糊思想較為散漫的學生，得一明確而有把握的概念，如九點圓的性質，半角的正弦或餘弦的公式，其證明手續較緊，不妨令學生復證一次。</p>
<p>（三）善用講演式的優點：（Ⅰ）便於有系統或有規律的敘述，如聯立議方程式解法的分類提出——自加减　消去……以至用行列式展開。（Ⅱ）便於結束上文已經說明的事項，如二次方程式在分別計算根的數值後，更作一總括的討論。（Ⅲ）便於提挈綱領，明示概要，如指出空間平面與直綫的命題，不外平行與垂直的關係。（Ⅳ）便於多方比較，使結果更覺明瞭，如以圓柱圓錐的表面積及體積的求法，與角柱角錐相提並論，最能使學生觀念分明。（Ⅴ）便於復習已知的東西，使學生易於接受新授的理論，如在敎球面三角前。須先為復述球面幾何諸性質。</p>
<p>（二）d，e，f，三式　這三式對於學生，雖說是靈活的，自動的，適應個性的，似乎頗合於敎學，但若不善應用，亦各有其流弊。</p>
<p>（一）不善用討論式的缺點：（Ⅰ）學習的機會，難與均等。（Ⅱ）學生發表思想，未必出於眞知灼見，易發生投機取巧諸弊端。（Ⅲ）論點動輒變更，每起無謂的爭執。</p>
<p>（二）不善用個別指導式的缺點：（Ⅰ）對於羣性的陶冶，缺乏機會，如公共錯誤，不能普遍促其注意。（Ⅱ）學生不肯自動努力，往往流於虛偽，而安於懶惰。（Ⅲ）敎師多勞，而學生得益有限，因人數過多，則時間不够分配。</p>
<p>（三）不善用自動發明式的缺點：（Ⅰ）時間殊不經濟。（Ⅱ）不適用於較難的或抽象的問題，如整數性質的探討等。（Ⅲ）不適用於低年級或某一學科開始學習時，如初讀幾何，一無依據，何從溫故而知新。</p>
<p>（三）分組實騐式　使用這個敎學方式的目的，在求算學上各種定理和方式，也如理化生物一樣的具體化，確是一個最新的動向，惟尚待研究的問題，有</p>
<p>（一）實騐材料的分配　如實物和形象的觀察度量衡的使用與整正，計算表的製作，圖解的應用，都是實騐的材料，但是這些材料究樣怎樣分配，才能合理呢？</p>
<p>（二）實騐程序的設計　如實騐片怎樣製定</p>
<p>（三）實騐工具的設備　如普通用具，計算用具，測量用具，幾何模型，以及物理器械等，都是實騐所必須的工具。但應該怎樣設備，才能够應用呢？</p>
<p>由以上的比較，敎學方式，空間誰為最良？應該怎樣取捨？我的意思是：</p>
<p>（一）敎學方法以研究而益精，因對象而各異，固無一成不變的格式，也無絕對優良的評價、</p>
<p>（二）以經過縝密的研究及切實的體騐所得的敎學方法，為較有意義而適用。</p>
<p>（三）採用任何方式，必須隨時活動，并須多方聯絡，切忌偏執成見，拘泥一種。</p>
<p>（四）取捨的標準，應以學生所得的利益，及其所表現的成績如何而定，敎師自身的方便與至，不當計及。</p>
<p>至於學生的練習簿不要批改，或是怎樣批改？這些課後處理的方法，任何敎師，無不認為很難解決的問題。依現在中學敎師的待遇，敎師的敎學鐘點，每週常超過二十小時，即是他所敎的常有四班的學生，其人數總在一百五六十人左右。今以每週每班收集練習簿一次，而每簿題數約二十條計算，則敎師每週至少須批改三千題，每題即假定需時半分，亦非二十五小時不辦，故敎師若批改練習簿，每日除上課外，用在課後處理的工夫，平均當在四時以上，其他預備敎材，研究敎法，核閱試卷等等，尚未計及。故時間不敷，已足為解決該問題一大障礙；况練習簿旣不易收集，其內容又多有抄襲雷同的弊病；而批改後學生是否注意覆看，還未可知。所以有人說：批改練習簿，在敎師已耗費甚大的勞力，結果乃為抄襲的學生做校對，並不能使他們會做習題。然而學生怎樣學算學，我在前說過，非有充分的練習不可；而學生成績的改進，全在敎師平日的指導周詳；且旣經督促學生演題，所演如休，何可不予以指正？則練習簿有收集批改的必要，為敎學效能計，為學生進益計，絕無可疑。但在敎師是否有批改的可能，當視敎師能否活用批改的方式，及對於學生有無合法的敎學，和適當的訓練。如</p>
<p>（一）救濟批改時間不足的困難，敎師可於收集練習簿後，選擇所有練習簿（或每一簿中所有練習題）全數的三分一或四分一詳加批改，其餘則大略檢閱，下次再詳改其三分一或四分一。如此更番改正，在敎師至少可節省一半時間，學生則每學期每人可得到五次乃至六次詳細改正的益處，敎師又何憚而不為？但旣經收集，必須於最短時間內發還，否則某某題應如何演算，為日旣久，學生已經淡忘，敎師批改雖詳，學生亦不注意。</p>
<p>（二）督令學生按期練習，及免除互相抄襲的弊端。敎師必於敎學方法上確有研究，平日旣養成學生預習習慣，不許忽略；又重視課時工作，勿任放棄；復精選有用習題，勿使過量；則學生自樂於接受敎師的指示，練習不懈。敎師更於嚴訂考績辦法，遇有無意識的抄襲，雙方同時取消外，再施以心性的陶冶，一方面提起學生努力向上的興趣，一方面并培養學生獨立自助的觀念，以發揮眞實無偽的精神，則學生自以抄襲為何恥，所謂敎訓合一的效果。就可在這裏實現了！</p>
<p>第三，精神的表現　敎育為精神事業，欲求學生成績好，敎師固須有豐富的學識，和適當的敎法，更須有飽滿的精神。精神的表現有三方面：</p>
<p>（一）興趣　學生學算學，興趣要好，敎師敎算學，興趣更要好。普通從事於職業的人，往往在一行怨一行，敎師若也有這種傾向，則影響於學生的心裏很大。所以敎師必須有專業的志趣，和樂業的興味，因旣經以此為業，便當專心致志，不雜他念。</p>
<p>（二）態度　敎師的意思能否行使於學生，不關於敎師督率的寬嚴，而在敎師態度的表示，能否取得學生的信仰。所以敎師的態度，必須（一）嚴正　公平待遇，守法待遇，守法不阿。（二）步調緊張，負責任事。（三）誠懇循循善誘，寓有同情。</p>
<p>（三）體魄　飽滿的精神，寓於健全的體格；而的任務，非有兼人的體力，絕不能勝。所以敎師的體魄，必須注意鍛煉，務使其康健而堅強，則工作旣賴以完成，且可為學生表率</p>
<p>總括以上所說，我的結論是：</p>
<p>（一）理想的敎師，要有實力，也要有方法。</p>
<p>（二）有實力然後有方法，實力不充的敎師，方法雖多，亦無實效。</p>
<p>（三）惟人格高尚精神飽滿的敎師，纔能運用其方法，發揮其實力，以完成敎學的目的。</p>

<h3 id="c81">蔣總監演講　禁烟會的使命　在禁烟總會開會時致詞 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>南京訊、禁烟總會於二月一日、開首次會議、蔣總監出席致詞、題為「禁烟總會的使命」、茲錄其原詞於后、</p>
<p>「剛才聽到李秘書長（基鴻）報告最近幾年以來禁烟的經過、雖然一年比一年有進步、但是始終沒有照原定的計劃、達到預期的成效、這是自己實在覺得很慚愧、很對不起國家的地方、今天全國各界領袖、當此國家民族興亡的緊要關頭、為討論禁烟事情、集會於此、中正藉便將個人的意見、約略貢獻幾句、</p>
<h3 id="c82">鴉片危險勝於外侮 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>鴉片之必須禁約、盡人皆知、禁政之繼續推行、為時亦人、但是因為歷來禁烟不能澈底做到、一般人視為習以為常、一方面總是講鴉片要禁絕、一方面總以為要禁絕鴉片是很難、甚至說不可能的事、就是因為有這種矛盾的心理和事實、就是因為有這種矛盾的心理和事實、所以辦理禁烟事務的人、往往起初很熱心、很决心和勇氣、到後來漸漸消極灰心、甚至全無結果、所以我們今後要禁絕鴉片、第一就要打破這種舊有錯誤的觀念、要認定鴉片一定可以禁絕、並且要由我們下决心來澈底禁絕、其次、一般人還有一種錯誤的觀念、以為國家當前的危機、第一是外侮、其次才是鴉片、殊不知外侮是外來的侵略和壓迫、鴉片是本身的墮落與自殺、所以從事態的性質上講、鴉片比外侮、不知道要危險若干倍、而且外侮之來、本由於我們本身的紛亂腐敗和衰弱、如果我們能立志養氣、振作精神、修明內政、增强國力、當然有許多積極的建設事業要做、但是我們目前困為人才物力的限制、積極的建設事業、往往不容易舉辦、所以要在消極方面、將除弊卽所以興利、亦是事半功倍之道、講到消極除的事情、當然最急要最重大的、就是要禁烟、禁烟如果不能收效、其他一切政治建設的工作、無論我們如何努力、都不能收效、所以我們大家要看鴉片之危險、勝于外侮、要認定禁絕鴉片、為修明內政、復興國家的第一要務、</p>
<h3 id="c83">關於國家民族人格 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>禁烟之重要、雖然如此、但是過去主辦禁烟的機關、往往有名無實、或是始嚴終懈、起初辦事比較認眞、禁政比較嚴勵厲、以後漸漸廢馳、最後完全等於不禁、這種普通的情弊、直到最近、我們不能不說完全沒有、此次我們禁烟總會成立、可以說就是中國禁烟能否成功之最後的試騐、也就是我們國家民族的人格、能否屹立於國際社會中之最每年試騐、因為國際間要看人家所能做得到的事、我們能否做到、要看我們自己講的話、自己能否實行、總而言之、要看我們國家民族空間有沒有獨立自强的高尚人格、只要看我國能否從此禁絕鴉片、所以我們要為國家民族爭人格、必須儘速禁烟、</p>
<h3 id="c84">政府民眾共同努力 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>各位先生、向來都是犧牲自己的一切、來謀國利民福的、對於禁烟、當然特具熱誠、就是政府方面、我敢負責表示、政府亦絕無絲毫寓禁於徽、想延長稅收期間、以圖財政之任何便利的意思、政府的意思、絕對的是要想一個完善的有效辦法、儘早達到禁絕鴉片、掃除烟毒的目的、不過因為中國各方面的情形、比較特殊、禁烟的事情、如果單靠政府的努力、的確不容易澈底做到、因為有許多地方、（尤其是上海漢口天津各處的租界以及許多情弊、（尤其是外國人在中國境內販賣毒物）是政府的力量所不能完全到達的、所以有許多塲合、與其單靠政府的力量來禁烟、還不如靠社會的力量更加有效、如果社會上各界領袖先生們、大家對於禁烟的事情、能負起責任、共同努力、這個力量、比政府要大過十倍、例如今天到會的有二十幾位先生、如果各人無論在國內國外、無論對政府民眾、都能直接間接盡到宣傳勸導、以及監督和執行的責任、這個力量、一定比普通二十萬人還厲害、所以兄弟很希望此次在集會的時候、大家能悉心研討一個完善的計劃、以後大家要協助政府共同一致、以最大的努力、對鴉片宣戰、以期達到禁絕的目的、</p>
<h3 id="c85">協助各省澈底禁絕 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>再次、我們最近禁烟、每年都有進進步、除江浙兩省特着成效之外、所有長江中游、以及西北各省種烟區域、亦已銳减、就是過去產烟極多之四川、現在准許種烟的區域、亦四由十幾縣减為十縣了、但是我們要知道、這些成績、要能保持、尤其是要達到全國澈底禁烟的目的、必須政府和社會上各界領袖、繼續加緊努力、尤其是許多地方最高長官、我們相信他决不是貪圖稅收、但事實上畢竟缺少積極的决心、不能以實事求是的精神來禁絕鴉片、尤其邊遠各省、他們不知道內地已經實在嚴禁、難免如此、如果這種情形不能改變、我們禁烟總會、無論如何努力、恐怕大半工作、都曾等於紙上空談、難收實效、今天在座各位先生、都在各地方各界夙負聲望的、希望特別注意到這一點、隨時直接間接、或公或私、來鼓勵並協助各省主席、尤其是邊遠省區各地方長官司、使他們以後對於禁烟的事情、能够增加積極的精神、特別熱心加緊努力、至於禁烟督察處是受本會監督、主辦禁烟的機關、我們當然要格外嚴密監督、務使杜絕情弊、克盡職責、此外對於國際方面、尤其是上海·漢口·天津·等處租界、外國人直接間接製販毒品的事情、為我國政府權力之所不及、我們惟有盡力引起國際輿論的同情、藉社會的與道義的力量來防制、使販毒謀利的外國人、亦不敢明目張膽來做犯罪的行為、</p>
<h3 id="c86">最大决心完成工作 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>最後、在政府方面、兄弟以行政院長而兼禁烟總監、當然責任最為重大、剛才已經講過、禁烟是我們修明內政之第一要務、如果禁烟無成績、可以說其他任何政治建設、都是假的、都不能生效、所以今後禁烟能否收效、也就可以試騐我們政治力量之强弱、可以測定我們政治建設之成敗、一方面兄弟以此自勵、一方面還希望各位先生特別督促並協助政府、上下一致、共同努力、照預定的期限、達成預期的效果、總之、現在我們為要完成革命的政治建設、為要挽救國家民族的危亡、為要樹立國家民族高尚的人格、為要提高國家民族的地位、非儘速禁絕鴉片不可、我們要禁絕鴉片、一方面政府當然要負最大的責任、盡最大的努力、一方面更要增加全國各地負責當局積極的决心、鼓動一切友邦熱烈的同情、更要喚起全國民從普遍的覺悟、然後中外同心、上下同德、以最大的决心和勇氣、依照完善有效的方案、全體動員、共同努力、完成禁烟的工作、樹之我們國家最高的人格、來作我們民族復興之張本、這就是我們今天開紀念的重大意義、中正以此自勉、並勉我各位先生、希望大家盡到責任、完成全會的使命、」</p>

<h3 id="c88">中國之會計師事業（上） <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 徐永祚</p>
<p>（一）何謂會計師　近年來會計師之名稱，雖已為社會人士所習聞，然一般人對於會計師之職務及效能，猶大抵未能深切認識，或以為會計師者，專為人檢舉帳目上之舞弊及錯誤；或以為會計師者，不過為倒閉之商店辦理善後，即清理破產等事而已，二者俱不免陷於誤解。</p>
<p>以上二種誤解，均足給與會計師在社會上之地位以極大不利。蓋依此二種誤解而推論之，則凡工商事業之在帳目上交無舞弊錯誤情事，或在營業上並不至陷於破產清理者，將無聘請會計師之密要，而結果會計師乃成為一種不祥之物，卒一致一般人士，不敢與會計師交接，或不願與會計師相酬酢；蓋恐此種交接或酬酢，將使人疑其經營之事業，或有不幸事故發生也。</p>
<p>如上所述，苟以會計師事業，僅為舞弊錯誤之帳目上，查察檢舉，或為頻於倒閉之事業，破產清理，則其事務，可謂僅限於消極方面矣。然實際則大謬不然，蓋會計師業務中，屬於消極者，固然不少，而屬於積極者實佔多數。吾人須知聘請會計師，應在帳目尚無舞弊錯誤之先，事業猶在繼續經營之時，方可藉會計師之設計指導，而使事業得以欣欣向榮。然亦非謂會計師之消極效能，無益於社會，特因其不及積極效能之偉大，而認為不宜偏重耳。</p>
<p>昔者英國聘請會計師，嘗視其查出舞弊數目之多寡，而定其應得之報酬，惟今已不然。蓋事業規模擴大，組織內容複雜，對於會計管理，已能採用嚴密之內部牽制制度（Internal　CheckSystem），使舞弊錯誤之機會，極度减少，而不必藉會計師之摘發。於是會計師之職務，乃趨重於財政狀況之證明與舞弊錯誤之預防，即藉會計師之審查證明，而使其决算報告，確能表示正確之財政狀況及經營結果，並藉會計師之設計建議，而使制度設施，確能杜絕舞弊防止錯誤。由此可知會計師之職務，最初曾偏重於消極，而最近則已趨向於積極矣。英國某學者嘗調：「會計師寗為一警犬，毋為一獵犬」，蓋即此意。</p>
<p>雖然會計師之任務，猶不僅防止弊端而也，最大任務，尤貴能分析事業之進步趨勢，並指導事業之經營方針，使事業得依健全之趨勢，日臻繁榮，小之關係於一業之成敗，大之影響於整個國民經營之榮衰，其功效寗不偉大。故曰會計師之於工商事業，猶之醫師之於人生，若待有病者或已病在危篤而後求敎於醫師，晚矣。由此吾人可為會計師事業下一定義曰：「會計為一種專門職業，專門辦理關於會計上事前之組織設計，臨時之計算記錄，及事後之分析審查」。</p>
<p>會計師之業務效能，固如上述，然在我國，則會計師事業猶頗幼稚，以與英美較，適與其四五十年前之狀況，正復相同，且社會上利用會計師之機會，猶多今生於消極，良屬可嘆。實則際茲社會經濟陷於恐慌，事業經營，入於艱苦之時，正宣盡量利用會計師使其發近積極效能，而扶助工商界，趨於穩固健全之途也。</p>
<p>（二）會計師之資格　為會計師者，必須具備充份之學識經騐，故各國對於會計師之資格，大抵均有比較嚴格之限制，茲請先言英美之制度。</p>
<p>英美二國對於會計師之資格，限制較嚴，而尤以英國為甚，查英國會計師，主由各地會計師公會養成，其養成方法，都採取學習制。凡志在為會計師者，於中學卒業後，先投考會計師公會所主持之預備試騐，及格錄取後乃從一會計師學習；學習期內，非但並無俸給，且須納相當費用，學習期間為五年，惟於二年半後，須經過一度中間考試，及格後仍繼續學習，待五年期滿，尚肥肉經過一度考試，考試及格得加入公會，稱為Associate，上項資格中，曾在大學卒業者着，得免去試騐，並縮短學習期限為三年。惟所謂ssociate者，尚僅係一種副會員資格，故只能助理會計師，而不能獨立任事。但在助理期間，已有俸給。經助理五年後，始得使用Fellow　of　Chartered　Accountant，其後繼續執行業務滿五年，始得改稱為Member（美國之Member與英國之Fellow　相仿。）實顯然有寬嚴之別。</p>
<p>世界各國中限制會計師資格之一，自當推英國為最佳，美則次之。其他如德國，亦須經過考試，惟會計師考試事宜，係由商會主持，凡欲為會計師者，經投考及格後，得在商會宣誓，而稱為宣誓會計師。法國亦須經過二次考試及五年之實習，方不為公認專門會計劉麗，其規定係由政府公布之。惟有日本，雖其他一切文物制度，均能模倣歐美，而較我國早為發達，獨於會計師事業，却較中國為遲，查日本稱會計師為計理士，於民國十六年（昭和二年）始正式公佈計理士法，分考試及審查兩種，惟因審查之資格太寬，故人數至多（截至一九三五年末達七千餘人），流品極雜，致對於社會之信用，未能如英德法之堅，然因各方之反對甚烈，其計理士法，或亦於最近之將來，有修訂之可能。</p>
<p>我國最初頒佈會計師章程，在民國七年九月。當時余曾在銀行週報為之介紹，並評其制度之得失。惟因當時對於資格之限制，旣須在大學商科畢業，復須在資本五十萬元以上銀行或公司繼擔任會計主任五年以上，未免過嚴，故截至民國十年七月止，領得會計師證書者，不過十三人而已。至民國十二年七月工商部因鑑於規定過於嚴格，有碍會計師事業之發展，乃加以修正，凡且有上列二項資格之一者，即得登記為會計師，經如此修正後，因限制驟然放寬，故數月後即增加數十人，尤以經騐為資格而領得證書者居多，其以學校畢業為資格者，亦大都對於會計學科，未能有充分之修習，故一時人數雖然增加（至民國十五年止，共增二百五十餘人），但對於會計師事業之發展上，殊鮮貢獻，且其中眞正執行業務者，猶寥若晨星。直至國民政府成立，一方鑑於過去對於會計師資格之限制，過於寬濫，不足以資社會之信任，乃頒布會計註冊章程，採取嚴格主義，以考試為原則，以審查為例外，同時因內工商實業，漸呈活躍氣象，雖會計師法規復經工商部及實業部二度修改，但對於資格之限制，尚能學識與經騐並重，而全國會計師人數，亦有顯之增加（統計截至民國二十四年末止已超過一千四百餘名）。行見我國會計師事業，將有健全之發展，良可慶幸。</p>

<p>民豐紙廠數度試騐　籌欵製造四月出貨</p>
<p>大公社云、吾國人士之每年消耗於捲菸者、為數綦鉅、而捲菸之烟盒外壳硬紙、及捲烟用紙、多仰給於舶來品、每年損失、允堪驚人、茲有本市民豐造紙公司、研究製造捲菸用紙、除造成香烟外壳硬紙外、近復倣造捲烟之外表皮紙、刻已成功、預計於本年四月間、可以出貨、將來如能代替外貨、則每年可减少漏巵四五百萬元、大公社記者昨特往訪該公司負責人金潤庠、叩以倣製經過、茲誌其詳情如下、</p>
<p>捲烟用紙製造頗難　裹捲烟葉之外表白紙、平時吸者均不甚注意、但製造時頗多困難、因普通紙張、一經燃燒、卽有臭味、使人難聞、如以之裹烟、則於吸時卽感有難受之紙氣、同時紙張每多小孔、如以之裹烟、則因漏氣不能吸食、更因燃燒速度、須於烟葉相等、吾則烟葉已經燒盡、紙張尙未燒完、卽成中空之象、或則紙張已經燒完、烟葉尙未燒盡、又致烟葉散落、不能再吸、故製造此種表紙、必須有三條件、　紙質潔白無臭味、　紙張堅靱無孔、　燃燒速度與烟葉燃燒速度相同、因之頗難製造、</p>
<p>研究三年始獲成功　民豐廠研究製造捲菸表皮紙、已有二三年、曾經數度試騐研討、煞費苦心、結果覔得相當之植物原料與水量、並於三年前派工程師陳君、携此水與原料、赴德國試騐、復於去歲派工程褚吳兩君、赴日本實地考察、歸國後、又經數度研究、始得成功、</p>
<p>籌欵製造四月出貨　該廠現已籌欵八十萬、向外國訂購專造捲烟紙之機器二部、一部已先運到、現已在製造中、預計在本年四月間可以出貨、據稱、此種捲烟表皮紙之製造、因缺乏把握、極含有冒險性、屆時是吾能完全成功、與舶來品相同、猶難逆料、但該公司悉心研究、力謀改善、必可得成功之一日也、</p>
<p>年挽漏疤約五百萬　捲煙紙雖為微小之物、但因國人嗜烟者之多、故其耗費數量、亦頗不少、每年所出之華商捲烟、達七八十萬箱、每箱須捲烟紙一捲、故每年所耗捲烟紙亦須七八十萬捲、按之現在市價、每捲須値五六元、每年所費當達四五百萬元、如該廠能成功、則可减少一筆漏巵、因該廠之出品、可足敷全國華商烟廠之用云、</p>

<p>（上海工商業概況之十二）</p>
<p>二上海捲烟業之地位及其實況</p>
<p>上海捲烟業在全國該業中佔重要地位，巳不待言。惟在百分比中，佔若干數字，尙難確知，蓋目下尙缺乏該業全國之統計資料，今姑就上海及浙皖冀魯四省作一比較，以窺一斑。據民國一十四年中報年鑑所載，前開五區現存捲烟廠共計五十三廠，上海佔四十四廠，其他四區僅佔九廠：同時各廠資本，前者共計一八、九九二千元，後者共計僅三九〇千元，故說者謂無上海，中國即無捲烟業，亦非過苜。今將本埠主要各烟廠（資本十萬元以上者）之名稱，地址等，列表如决：</p>
<p>上海主要華商烟廠一覽表</p>
<p>廠名　廠址　創立年份　資本（單位千）</p>
<p>南洋兄弟烟草公司爲民族捲烟業之重鎭，華成爲該業後起之秀，所佔地位，均甚重要。按南洋除前表所列之製造廠外，尙有本埠及香港漢口等埠之總分公司甚多，規模甚大。該公司原爲無限性質，至民國七年始改爲有限公司，目下陳炳謙任董事長，簡玉階任總經理。該公司出品牌號甚多，維以白金龍，大長城，大聯珠爲最有名。華成烟草公司，在寗波路中吒弄設有發行所，於民十二年改爲股份有限性質，現任總經理爲鎭海戴畊莘氏。該公司有新　兩製造廠，佔地十二畝，機件完善，出品以美麗金鼠兩牌爲最盛行。</p>
<p>去年八月問有華菲烟公司之興起，資本爲五十萬元，全部幾由Philirpine　Aromatic　Cigarette　Manufacture　Co供給，董事兼總經理爲林朝聘氏，對於捲烟業頗有經騐。工廠及總辦事處設於保定路，發行所設於牛莊路，房屋均係租借，月租七百餘元。廠內有捲烟製造櫗三部，切烟　二部，打包機一部，與其他生財合計？約値二十餘萬元。出品有英雄牌，白宮牌，黃姑娘牌三種。據說該廠製烟機每分鐘能奎香烟一千二百枝，雪茄烟八百枝云。</p>
<p>硏究中國或上海之捲烟業，吾人最不容忽視者，卽爲英美烟草公司所居之優越　位。考該公司最初名美商茂生洋行，後因美商無意經營，轉　與協隆洋行，後又轉讓與豐裕洋行，至一九零三年，更山豐裕售與倫敦英美烟草公司，而成爲該公司在華之總公司。本埠英美烟草公司之總行設於蘇州路六號，分公司週內地各重要城鎭，浦東陸家嘴與陸家渡及韜朋路六七叫號，均有其製造廠，資本之雄厚，設備之完全，在南洋華成之上。回時魯皖豫一帶之烟葉市場，又全在該公司操縱之中，且自二十三年十一月一日起，易牌號爲頤中運銷烟草公司，避人耳目，跌價傾銷，用意頗爲深長（未完）</p>

<p>「那末來罷」，裴先生也喊着，於是就領導高呼，歡喜雷動，震驚了廚房裏的亞西，老羅先生適驅車走過門前也聽見了搖頭說道：</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>一年更換，穩渡以過，工商業中，相見之時，每以「恭喜」「如意」，互相致祝，商塲習慣，未能免俗，亦屬事理之常。記者之意，認為工商界之可以恭喜者，莫過於工業安全；可以認為如意者，亦莫過於工業安全。蓋經營一工廠，果能無災無難，平安穩渡此為最可恭喜最是如意之事。此則應凖備於平時，非注意於一日。凖備者何，廠房建築，是否滴宜，一旦有警，可否隔絕，而不致蔓延？機器排列，是否勻稱？實地工作，有否妨碍？危險事項，能否避免？消防設備，已否完全？平時實習，已否熟練？尤其於汽鍋之檢騐，電綫之檢査，以及容易着火之處。所與品物，均應以科學之方法，作嚴格之考査，古人云與其焦頭爛額，不若曲突徙薪，故恭喜如意不必呌，而工業安全却不容忽。此次實業部與中央工檢處所辦工業衛生展覽會，卽為此旨而設。滬上國貨工廠領袖，聯袂往觀，極有心得。上海機聯會程守申君發表參觀之感想：認為會申所列之安全物品，均屬各工廠不可缺少之設備、於改進國貨工業上，有極大助力。其為國貨界所重視，可見一斑。記者甚願全國之國貨工廠領袖，一致提倡予以贊同，則本年之出超，為數更可驚人也。</p>

<p>憶曩日蓬萊市塲國貨展覽會開幕那天，先生對羣衆大聲疾呼！要大家牢記國貨，愛用國貨，而勸「大家不要買東西」一語，是幽默含有至理的驚人詞鋒，當時聽衆均莫明其土地堂，經先生解釋謂「不要買東×貨，也不要買西×貨，」衆始恍然！蓋通常稱「東西」是商品的代名詞，無怪大衆誤會，要斷絕用品，怎麽可以呢？不知先生的演說天才，靈敏思想，有足使人悅服者，再又可徵先生　口曉音之熱心提倡國貨矣，予無暇再往訪問，因寫述以前所得先生印象，為國人吿焉。</p>
<h3 id="c184">南京中央商塲巡禮 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 李安夫</p>
<p>在這各種事業突飛猛進中的首都，集團式的國貨商塲，雖然並不是絕對的沒有；其低級的如夫子廟的新市塲，較好的也有大中國商塲以及國貨公司等　，但是牠們內容的佈置失當或貨品的缺乏，顯然對於這擁有超過了百萬市民的都城是不足夠的，於是南京中央商塲就在市民這樣的需要之中產生出來了！</p>
<p>中央商塲開幕了！不論是買東西抑或是看熱鬧，大家都想來看看這京市首屈一指的大商塲；於是我也雜在人羣中擠進去。當一走到中正路上時，那鋼骨水泥像戰勝坊似的中央商塲的牌坊，就映進了眼簾，尤其那高聳的屋頂更是顯明。走進牌坊，大約相距三四十步，就是那中央商塲的門面，他建築的雄偉佔地的廣大，就上海來說：並不亞於大陸商塲，而且因為他在大甬道的屋頂上都用的是玻璃天棚，所以光綫的優美，更非大陸商塲所能及到的。同時又因第一號就是中央花園，所以在門面兩旁特地砌了兩個樣園，於是在門面上是更幽美了！</p>
<p>走進門口就可以看見兩旁的商店，在廣闊的走廊中間，又設了許多玻璃的攤櫃，這式樣有人說像是北平的東安市塲，其實東安市塲又那有這樣好的建設和光綫呢！走完長廊轉入左面，同樣是另一個長廊，他的式樣，簡單的說起來，仿佛是一個狹長的口字中間放了一個大十字。其中樓下是比較最切實用的舖子，上面是菜館茶室等等；店攤一共一六七間，經售的貨品有京，滬，漢，平，閩，粵，浙，川，各地的物產，其間可以說完全的國貨，眞的像這樣廣大的集團商塲不要說在首都，就是在上海似乎也沒有，同時更可以令人滿意的，就是設有管理處，定有規約，使得一切的商店公共遵守，如標出價格，規定廉價期等等，造成了一個以新姿態演出的國貨商塲。而且在他們計劃之中，還有遊藝塲電影院，無疑的，這中央商塲以後的命運，一定會有更大的發展。</p>
<p>記者遊覽了一周之後，覺得我們對於任何事業，往往只會呌而不會實行。例如提倡國貨這個口號，卽使小學生也唱得異常順口，但是在那一個國貨年裏奏了成效，各種貨品進口的統計表上，他的數目是日增月盛，而在我們大喊着提倡國貨的口號之中國家却一天窮一天，我們自己不妨捫心自問，究竟是為了什麽？還不是只知呌而不知做的效果嗎？所以當我看了中央商塲後給我的敎訓，就是我們要幹的精神</p>
<h3 id="c185">希望於市民服用國貨年者 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>時代的巨輪，一天一天的向前進展，壁間的日暦，也一張一張的向下撕毀；一轉眼的功夫，這厚厚的一本日曆，已經撕完了！於是這中華民國二十四年，—學生國貨年，也就結束了！當然，在這學生國貨年裏，總算有幾件差強人意的事情，但是提倡國貨的還沒有成功，這是無可諱言的，所以這提倡國貨的工作，還有再接再厲的必要。不過二十四年的學生國貨年已經終了！這二十五年又是什麽年呢？上海各團體，經過幾次會議以後，已經把今年—中華民國二十五年—定為市民服用國貨年了。根據這市民二字，顯然的，是指上海而言，所以今年的提倡國貨的旗號，是：上海市民服用國貨年。我們對於這一種旗幟，是非常的贊成。因為上海是我國唯一的大都市，上海所消耗的外貨，民是首屈一指。而且上海還是我國商業重心的所在地。所以用上海市民服用國貨年旗幟的意義有幾點：第一：上海旣是我國唯一的大都市，則上海目有領導全國的責任；第二：上海旣是外貨進口最多的地方，又是外貨的總轉運的一個地點。上海旣然實行提倡國貨；服用國貨；由外貨自然不會源源而來了！第三：上海旣然是全國工商業重心所在地，則根據提倡國貨，須先從。工商業改革入手的原則，尤為切合。所以我認為上海市民服用國貨年的規定，是非常的恰當。但是在這上海市民服用國貨年才開始的當兒，有幾點希望全國同胞們加以注意：</p>
<p>第一：今年雖然是上海市民服用國貨年，但是凡是中華國人，都有服用國貨的義務，切不可以為把責任推到上海人的身上就算了事。要知道今年旗幟的用意，是山上海人領導我們全國人民服用國貨，這一點必須認淸。</p>
<p>第二：在這上海市民服用國貨年開始的時候，大家可以反省一下自己對於去年提倡國貨的情形，能夠努力實行的，固然要加倍努力；沒有能夠實行的，應該從速痛改前非。</p>
<p>第三：希望全國的工商業，都努力於出品的改良，使每一件出品，都能合乎國人的需要，而售價方面，在可能的範圍以內，儘量的减低，以達到產銷和顧客三方面的合作。</p>
<p>第四：布望全中國人都從今年起完全服用國貨。</p>
<p>最後，謹祝上海市民服用國貨年的成功！</p>

<h3 id="c209">民族主義的性質 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>民族自覺是民族的自己認識，同時又發生於被壓迫民族，所以喚起民族自覺的民族主義，是打到帝國主義的旗子。因而它的性質是政治的。</p>
<p>這一點，為理解民族主義的關鍵之一。所以張佛呆在國聞週報中說「我們必須把民族主義放在道德的基礎上面使它成為一種人人可以信從的健康的倫理原則」（第十三卷第一期）的話，很不正確。</p>
<p>那末「民族主義的目標在這時實不外為反帝國主義，藉民族主義以與帝國主義抗鬥」（同前）而已。是的，這正是民族主義的根本作用。它在此外就沒有別的了。</p>
<p>所以張佛泉之以「民族主義是外向的，是消極的，是破壞的」（同前）為民族主義應加修正的理由，根本錯誤。他對於民族主義實在沒有理解。事實上，民族主義的發生，實踐和作用，不都在於被壓迫民族消極破壞外來的侵略勢力而獲得解放之一點上嗎？除此以外，還有甚麽民族主義可言呢？</p>
<p>這並不是說它對於經濟，道德，教育，藝術等生活沒有影響。當然有的。政治生活的優越性和各種生活的交互性，是必然要把民族主義　張到各方面去的。所謂國民經濟，還不是民族經濟的別名嗎？</p>
<p>同樣，它也就有內向的，積極的，建設的之意義了。反帝國主義的民族經濟在這一方面說來，不是一個顯然的例子嗎？</p>
<p>但這絕不曾改變民族主義的性質。反之，它的擴張倒是把經濟，道德，教育，藝術等等變成民族的政治運動之手段的意思。換一句話，就是想從各方面來造成反帝國主義的革命抗鬥。</p>
<p>那末，它擴張到各方面所表現的內向性，積極性，建設性，都不過是為被壓迫民族消極地破壞外來的侵略勢力而有的活動罷了。它的目的在形成一別於帝國主義之獨立的革命力量。</p>
<p>如果我們覺得形成民族的革命力量這種工作很重要，因而把民族主義的內向性，積極性，建設性高揚起來，這就是說，要主張民族經濟，民族道德，民族敎育，民族藝術等等，是不妨把民族主義的內向性，積極性，建設性拿來與民族主義的外向性，消極性，破壞性平行的</p>
<p>那末，我們可以說，民族主義對於帝國主義而言，是外向的，消極的，破壞的；對於被壓迫民族而言，是內向的，積極的，建設的。它並不單純，含有矛盾性，為對立的統一物之一種。如是而已。</p>
<p>因此，張佛泉把民族主義的內向性，積極性，建設性看成與民族主義的外向性，消極性，破壞性不相容，而主張用前者來代替後者，便完全不對了。</p>
<p>只可整理內部，不可抵禦外侮。那還不是反對打倒帝國主義的妥恊傾向嗎？</p>
<p>然而在帝國主義侵略日益加緊的今天，在十分需要喚起民族自覺運動的今天，我們對民族主義的外向性，消極性，破壞性，還有特別高揚的必要。就在形成民族的革命力量時，即發揮民族主義的內向性，積極性，建設性時，亦必注意於這點。不然，那只能造成力量，不能造成民族的革命力量，供反對帝國主義以取得民族解放之用。</p>
<p>因此，我們對於張佛泉的「新解釋」，不能不予以批判。一切文化界中人，在今天，都應該起來反對妥協意識，反對民族的取消主義。這不楚我們對於當前最需要的民族革命運動應有的努力嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c210">東京中國學生的文化活動 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 石吟</p>
<p>在尖銳的監視與壓迫之下，留在東京的數千中國學生，對這日益嚴重的國難，竟毫無一點表示，這是不能不對國內此决被犧牲的同學表示慊意的。但一年來東京的中國留學生却呈現着一件在留日學坐史中未會有過的好現象，這便是文化事業的活動。現在我們可以分作兩點來說明這個題材：</p>
<p>A出版事業</p>
<p>「留東新聞」：這是傳湘謨君主辦的一種小報紙，創辦於去年上半期。起首上週判，後來因銷路頗佳，便改為三日刋。開頭數期中的內容極薄弱，僅僅是介紹一些關於留學生中的瑣屑消息。後來漸漸介紹國內的重要消息，因此同學中對它的需要程度亦漸漸增高了。</p>
<p>「雜文」：是一種定期的小文藝刋物。起先參加的角色頗多，後來因經費困難，無法維持，大家都和它告辭了，只剩下勃生，猛克，任白戈諸人拼命掙扎。這個判物雖小，而在國內及此間同學們的腦干中所留下的影子却非常濃厚。它的態度正確，它是積極的，是在用一條結實的麻繩拖者沉重的時代前進的，是與反動的，消極的，頽廢的，向局部社會賣笑的「論語」立在對面的。出到第四期時，突遭東京警察搜查，現已改為「質文」。聞第五期不久又將出世。</p>
<p>『東流」：東流也是一着重於文藝的刋物，成續雖不及「雜文」，但也得算為第二流雜誌。如果社會能許它好好生長下去，將來的成績定有可觀。但它却與「雜文」同遭不幸，當時主編的陳君還被拉到警視廳去了，現在雖早已放回來，可是「東流」是「如水東流」了。</p>
<p>「詩歌」：起初是每期出一張，是一種專門弄詩歌的定期刊物。後來因銷路不好，經費又極困難，於是大家都不來了。最後由魏進君一人負經濟及編輯全責，改為雜誌，可是只出一期便與世長辭了。</p>
<p>「劇場藝術」：由留在東京的話劇團體所主辦的一種專門硏究戲劇的雜誌，創刋不久，內容頗好，但亦因經費關係不能按期出版。</p>
<p>「留東學報」：陳固廷君主編，以政治經濟文藝等為內容，已出三期，依陳君之努力，仍當繼續下去。</p>
<p>「社會知識」：是一個總合雜誌，分國際，婦女，文藝三欄，而着力於國際欄。專門介紹國際政治，經濟，軍事，外交，諸消息，帮助國內讀者對國際形勢之認識。「社會知識」是用極經濟的手段，正確的態度使國內同胞在這演變得莫明其妙的五花八門的國際政情里，找出一點綱領和路綫米。婦女欄是由十幾位女同學辦理的，她們感覺得國內的婦女刊物太少，特在「社會知識」里分去一塊地盤，為國內的婦女說幾句應說的話。她們的目的是　討究中國婦女出路；　介紹日本婦女生活；　介紹國際婦女消息；　介紹中華留日女學生生活。文藝　是由此間研究文藝的同學們擔任稿件即編輯，沒有長篇創作，注重描寫實際生活的短小作品及介紹國際著名文藝。由周默秋君主編，上海羣衆雜誌公司總經售，印刷與發行亦均在上海。</p>
<p>「學術界」：明治大學中華同學會所主編的一種季刊，由劉驥君負責編輯。以前因經費關係停頓了，至最近才刋行復刊號。印出來後，警視廳不許發行，原因是因為里面有一段題名為「戰爭與道德」的補白：「世界上的人，大多數是厭惡戰爭的。違反了多數人的意志去製造戰爭是不道德的……」，後來遵警察的命令，將道一段補白刪去，才准許發行。日本政府一定要將這段「非戰」的補白刪去，我們可以知道他們愛好和平的態度了。</p>
<p>B戲劇畢業</p>
<p>中國戲劇，在東京已獲得了相當的聲譽，大家只要看看名作家秋田雨雀在朝日新聞上的莊嚴愼重的介紹，就可以知道中國留學生對戲劇之努力了。戲劇團體頗多，主要的有中華戲劇座談會，中華國際戲劇協進會，中國同學新劇會等。關於成績方面，則前二者頗不及後者。中華同學新劇會在東京已有數次大規模的表演。去年十一月在築地小劇場所表演的「視察專員」等，所收效果極良。大家都很肯定地說　個戲團將來是有希望的。</p>
<p>總而言之，東京的中國留學生是絕對沒有忘記祖國災患的，我們是時刻都在為祖國努力，只以環境不同，努力的方式亦因以稍異，這是應該求得各方面的諒解的。教們在此地遭受着非人的待遇，無時無刻不在嚴重監視　　生。要是不因為祖國之積弱，又何至於此？我們流着淚希望祖國能忍苦掙扎，希望祖國也有一天能在峻　嚴岩的國際的險地上伸一仲屈曲已久的腰！</p>

<p>還有一種情形，影饗於定價很大的，便是做「生意經」的方法，新書店如了要推廣其銷售網，盡量討好於內地書賈，這種書賈對於書是什麽都不知道的，只知道代理折扣大，回佣高。但如依從他們的要求，新書店必然虧本，吾則書又無法推銷。於是新書店中聰明的經理們，想到了兩全共美的方法，卽學馬路上的洋貨店，明中大喊廉價，暗中抬高碼洋。因之，近年來，書業並沒有發展，而書的定價則日高。</p>
<p>因之，就發生了一個奇怪的現象，卽讀者購書，到上海本店去購，其價格往往比在外埠代售處耍高，在上海本店售實價的書，在外埠七折八折，都可購到。上海的各代售別家書的書店，對於某大書局的書，往往並不就近向其直接配購，而反向外埠的代售處輾轉購來，其代價此向共本店直接購買者為廉。代售者不增加手續等費，而共價反較本店為賤，豈非怪事？但如我們知道了上述的原因，卽可無所驚奇。新書店本店也何嘗不想跌價以廣招徠，但這是與內地代售處的利益相衝突的。如本店現售實價，同行批發七折，內地書賈滿意了，但若本店也以七折出售，而不予同行以七折的七折，則各地的代理者均將會把書退回。所以，精明的讀者，常多不向本店購書，而轉向於代售者。</p>
<p>一九二九年後，因文化運動的衰落，讀書空氣一般的消沈，新書業已感受打擊，自世界經濟恐慌發生以後，讀者的購買力更形枯竭，於是「全部新書半價」，這種空前的慘象卽被逼發生。這並不見讀者的福音，而是新書業破產的朕兆。除了一二家大書店為排措別人傾銷外，大部份都見虧折血本、以相掙扎。你不見不是有許多在過去有歷史的新書店，現在都入於停頓狀態？他們的營業衰落了，開支是一樣的，不把存貨盡量售出，也許卽可被逼關門。自最近幣制改革以後，紙價及其他成本顯然增加了不少。但你還能和以前似的，因成本增加，來一下「同業公議，照碼加一」不能？新書業的全部崩潰，恐怕就在不久的將來罷。</p>
<p>至於那些「一折八扣」的無版權書的翻印，雖云是一種畸形的現象，並不是直屬於新書業範圍內事，但也可反映出今日的中國出版界與文化界，已走上了怎樣一個階段了。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c212">寫作與出版 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 伍蠡甫</p>
<p>魯迅先生新近在海燕發表題未定草，說朱光潛先生以「靜穆」（Serenity）為詩之極境，未免把詩縮小，而且「凌遲」了詩人。因為凡是看到詩昨的全面，或詩人的全部生活，以及作用於詩人的社食狀態，我們自會放棄任何一種抽象的籠統的斷語，為「淸奇」，「典雅」，「閒適」之類。其實，像朱先生的籠統的方法，我們在一般文藝批評裏，時常都會遇到的。像硬把什麼「前進」，「落伍」等等加在某某作家之上，便是很顯明的例子，不過因為這些比「靜穆」，「清奇」又來得新一點，所以許多人不覺得怎樣地礙眼。於此，不禁聯想到我們在寫作與出版的關係上，也有這類模糊的認識，急須把它指破啊！</p>
<p>寫作本是直抒胸臆，不尙諱飾，尤其不該作為，但是到了出版的時候，卻另是一回事了。這在過去一兩年的判物裹，作家受著出版上的限制，不容他不遮掩，不含混，一面遣就，一面達出自己的意思。他甚至於用次一號的東西，來代巷頂上的貨色，好像道地藥材的字號抓著二等貨頂換了頭等貨一樣。我們讀了這類文章，倘若認為作家本意僅止於此，那就未免錯誤。內中很淸楚的一椿便是：介紹紀德式的思想，在去年特別盛行。紀德的論著，最近的行動，演說等等在刊物上登載特多。比較可以照見這位文化要人的眞面目的，則有描寫自己（譯文一卷二期），題為擁護文化的那篇演說（時事類編三卷十七號）和紀德的生平及著作（世界文學一卷六期）。這裏所頂換了的，是些什麽呢？</p>
<p>在第三篇裏，我們看見紀德一生的幾個大轉變：先是一位新敎的禁慾主義者，「夜裏睡在本版上，黎明跳入冷水中，中夜更起來祈禱」；隨又以為「以「理」服「欲」，用「道德」摧殘「自然』，是「殘酷而不合理的」，於是防堤崩潰，「他就縱情於聲色淫樂之中了」；跟着「理」「欲」又起衝突，使他陷入苦悶，開始考察人生眞諦，最後得到這末一個結論——「假使人能够將一切不從意識中發出的動作，都當作恥辱，則人的生活，一定可以改觀；」因此，他一面咀咒資本主義的貪婪，一而並不吾定個人的自由；他終於認為「在眞實意義上的個人主義，應該是有益於社會的，將個人主義與集體的社會主義對立起來，實在是一種錯誤。」這幾僩步驟不締描出現代一大羣智識份子的經過，尤其點明那「寄寓於溫情」的「激越」，以別於那「被壓於長期的肢體辛勞」的「奮然興起。」在第二篇裏，我們遇見那鮮明耀目的幾行字：一我是法蘭西人，同時是國際主義者，我澈底贊成科學的社會主義，同時我也是澈底的個人主義者。」他顯然是想在新社會裹，如何保持各個人的最大特性，而又可以在理論上講得過去。他繼續找尋調和社會與個人的徑途，不過資本主義社會的個人主義的精神還深深潛伏於他的人格裹。雖說他現在所唱的「各個人保持自己的最大特性時，才能服務社會」一個命題，可以合乎辨證法的解釋，然而我們總覺得紀德是太巧一點，太擅詞令了。在第一篇裏，他說自己是怎樣地喜歡孤獨，縱使有所表現，也得要檢一個比較冷淡的方式。所以，「我所挑選的，是與其言語，不如文章，與其新聞雜誌，不如單行本，與其投時好的東西，不如藝術作品。」這更使我們懂得紀德如何同情那「藏之名山」的隱逸者流。統而觀之，從這些重要文獻中得到的紀德，是轉形文人的一型；我們和他老人家親近親近，自然沒有多大妨碍，然而在寫作的旨趣上講，一味地介紹他，只能相當刺激一般知識界，收些動搖的效果，至於在積極指導上，畢竟還嫌力量不够吧！（未完）</p>

<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>神經衰弱症，最初發生大都為性神經衰弱，如早洩，遺精，陽萎等之現象，迨後漸决進展脊髓神經而終至腦神經衰弱，此際則發生頭暈，目眩，耳嗚，多夢，失眠，四肢無力，全身倦怠，記憶不佳等現象，其顯著者荐骨部常發生疼痛，本症治療，除患者自身須力除致病之誘因外，對於生活環境之攝生，亦頗緊要，如作業與休息，須求適度，規定飲食時間，避去不規則之生活，正思慮，絕慾念，選擇適當之營養品，務使身心得到安靜與自由，藥物的治療，以內分泌及有機性燐為最佳，蓋此二者俱為神經系之補藥，人體消耗此二素質過多，自應求相當之補充不可，不過此類藥物，類似者頗夥，須注意擇優，方克奏效。</p>

<p>— 佘雷醫師</p>
<p>（一）遞減法，一名抽替法，此法由來使用久矣，往昔醫者替人戒煙，實舍此法而無由，即近今戒法雖多，要亦未能全為捐除也，本法之使用，係取鴉片代替品，其佳者若新科代因等，逐漸減少，以斷絕煙癖。</p>
<p>（二）起泡法，本法用發泡藥敷貼於被戒者胸部腹部腿部之平坦處，寺其起包，抽取是項包夜注射於被戎者之體內，本去初盛行於安南，為「馬迪拿」氏所發明，其理由，謂此種水泡上雖尙無精詳闡明，而實騐上得時收佳果，足以明證。</p>
<p>（三）採血法，本法採自就戒者靜脈內之血液五至十西西，或遽行注人，或製成血淸後注入後戒者之肌肉內，同時一方須注人葡萄糖等以補其損，本法普通的應用七八次，即可凈除煙毒。</p>
<p>（四）變質法，此法乃將有機性鈣化合劑，每日行靜脈之注人，能使身體內與細胞結合之煙毒，漸漸分離，終至完全消失。</p>
<p>（五）蛋黃素法，蛋黃素係從動物腦質，卵黃及黃豆中取得，效力較顯偉者，莫卵黃者，據服用者云，終鮮完全之效，是以單獨運用，成效可疑，或用他法補助，或用本法補助他法，庶幾完美。</p>
<p>（六）安眠法，投大量安眠劑於受戒者，使其昏睡，而不覺任何發癮之痛苦，去其煙癖，達戒絕目的。</p>

<p>— 孫志耀</p>
<p>從前治療淋病，迄無妥善辦法，現代科學昌明，對此向稱難治之疾症，亦有相當的把握了，所謂四項療法者，即（一）短波透熱電療，是機以熱力殺菌，其深透之力，實倍諸色素而上之，（二）混合淋苗之注射，乃得奏自働免疫之效，療淋上可謂極合理，各國醫界，對於淋病治療，莫不悉採此法，（三）內服，當擇具有强力之透膜殺菌劑，如「滅殺淋」然，實與電療及注射諸法，有異曲同工之妙，（四）局所療法，在先都採用蛋白銀等製劑之藥液，自最近德國滿爾志大藥廠，新發明之聖品「淋毒舒樂耳」出，於焉爭相購用，是藥係用淋病血淸製成之流膠樣物，能奏免疫滅菌之效，為淋病局部用藥中之翹楚。如期治療，誠臻療淋法中之最上乘矣。</p>

<p>— 劉玄女醫師</p>
<p>淋病之起因，為不潔交媾，傳染淋濁雙球菌所成，淋病之治療方法，最要者為殺滅淋菌，方可斷根，此已為近時代之普通常識，故治療淋病之內服藥品，其優劣之區分，當以能吾有殺滅淋菌之特效為前題，蓋傳染淋病之後，淋菌侵入尿道各部，允以粘膜深部，繁殖與潛伏最多，治淋之藥品，其藥力如能深透尿道粘膜，將淋菌盡滅，淋病自即痊愈，是以藥之優劣，只在於藥力是吾可以透粘膜而殺淋菌之特效而定，據個人臨床經騐，淋病內服藥之「滅殺淋」有異常之效騐，其藥力足以深透粘膜，將淋菌完全殺滅，收效之迅速，尤為類似品中所僅見。</p>

<p>— 鄭志舫</p>
<p>此二者，均屬皮膚病之一種，其原因皆由一種病菌寄生傳染而生，息者痛癢難忍，有時遍及全身，痛苦更不堪，常時發時隱，相互傳染，根除奇難，癬之種類甚多，如蛇皮癬，陰癬，濕癬等等，不論何種癬患，要皆皮膚抵抗力缺乏，為病菌侵染所致則一。疥瘡則分乾性濕性兩種，濕性較甚於乾性，甚或有極深之瘡瘍，愈期亦較長。治療方法，如滅疥，水楊酸，鍟養，硫黃，等等為不可或缺之藥劑，近今之「滅絕菌」，即依如此而製配，治效準確，不同凡品，電械療法方面，則水銀石英燈及人工太陽燈，俱有相當之効。</p>

<p>— 方</p>
<p>我國古代雖無所謂外交，然而歷朝遊說之風，卻頗盛行，允其是在　　各據一方，獨自稱王底動亂的時代。春秋戰國時的所謂「合　」「連　，　卽是出自一般遊說者之口。不是他們　也許六國不會分裂；不是他們，六國也許將無法以制秦。蘇秦張儀，都以一得之見，居然榮任了大官。用近代的眼光來說，這就是國與國之間的外交戰。</p>
<p>「遠交近攻」，本是春秋戰國時代，秦國之所以持以分散六國勢力，以圖逐一兼併者。歷史上曾經運用這把外交戰的武器，在歷朝也並不罕見；而今我國東隣的帝國主義者，居然也就學會了這一手。二月一日華聯社的東京電中有謂人「日本對世界政策，决定採『遠交近攻』主義，故對蘇對華，决發揮實力，爭决死之勝負；而對於國際，則表示多角主義，通商協交。…觀乎這封電訉，卽得其明證。</p>
<p>目前這個時代，自然大異於春秋。而且，日人之所謂『遠交近攻』，其用意也並不同於春秋時代，他一方面旣持反蘇「防共」為名，以弭止國際帝國主義的反對，一方面卻打算「步步為營」來割裂我中國。觀乎束北，華北，及內蒙之現狀，就够使吾人悲憤欲絕。近日外蒙蘇聯與「滿洲」邊境之間，時生衝突，甚至短兵相接，卽知是電所傳，並非無據。而日人之用「遠交近攻」，並且更進一步的進與西方反蘇先鋒之德國締結「軍事同盟」，明顯的卽是其實踐獨覇遠東及重新分割世界的企圖。</p>
<h3 id="c223">巧克力姑娘 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>—上海劇院第三决公演</p>
<p>繼復旦的「委曲求全」和業餘劇人的「欽差大臣」之後，現在又有上海劇院的「巧克力姑娘」了。</p>
<p>作為「巧克力姑娘」上演的理由的，大概是因為喜劇容易討好觀衆，容易吸引觀衆罷？「委曲求全」和「欽差大臣」，不就是擁着很多的觀衆嗎？然而祇有笑料而沒有諷刺的，也能算是喜劇嗎？</p>
<p>上海劇院在陳大悲先生「獨家經理」的時候，上曾經有過兩次公演過的——「摩登夫人」和「西施」。那兩次公演的成績都不好：「摩登夫人」的「文明戲」味太重；而所謂樂劇「西施」，則又是「改良京戲」化了的。</p>
<p>這次，新加入了一位向培良先生，向先生平常對戲劇是至少有過一番研究的，因之雖是上海劇院前兩次的成績都使我失望，而這次，我卻依舊有勇氣去看他們的第三次公演。</p>
<p>可是，失望得很，「巧克力姑娘」給與我的，還是一個失望。——這一次，雖然有了向培良先生做了舞台監督。</p>
<p>「巧克力姑娘」的劇本我沒有讀過，連有沒有中文譯本我也不知道，因之，所謂「陳大悲先生改編」，是否是根倨法文原作改的，還是根倨別國文字轉譯或是由中文譯本改編？我無從得知。</p>
<p>從舞台上得來的直覺，那麽「巧克力姑娘」的劇本是應該非常輕的輕的像劇名所顯示的那樣，像一顆小姐少爺們所愛好，閒下來喫着玩的巧克力糖。</p>
<p>——是的，「巧克力姑娘」的演出意義，也祗是給小姐少爺們閱著時候看著開開胃而已。這裡它告訴你一個「嬌生慣養的小姐，生平沒有人敢違反她一句話。她倦于這種生活。要找一個剛强的男子。保羅則因她不講禮貌對之甚為厭惡。但厭惑會引起注意，注意會發生愛情」。它吿訴你「駡是歡喜打是俏」。它吿訴你「保羅呢婚事掉了，飯碗也掉了，把巧克力姑娘恨入骨髓。但是天下的事有恨就有愛，他不知不覺地把巧格力姑娘愛在心頭」。——你瞧，這樣的所謂「喜劇」，不是正好給少爺小姐們剝着巧克力糖看着玩嗎？</p>
<p>而在演出上，「巧格力姑娘」可沒有劇本那樣的輕鬆，雖然因為劇本結構的笑料豐富，（僅僅是笑料而已）在座地裏也時常有笑聲可以聽到，可是那幾聲是因為劇本所構成的，並不是導演有什麽特殊的技巧。——要笑，以胡鬧著名的惠爾勒，何爾塞倆的滑稽此是更會使你笑的。</p>
<p>譚到演員的演技，那麽程靜子小姐的「巧格力姑娘」，是恁性尙可，高貴不足，因為高貴不足的緣故，所以她給我的印象，就祇是一個愛嬌的小姑娘撤嬌而已。（這是生活不够和對角色不够理解的綠故，在第四幕裏的個性不够把握，更其顯露出來）。依决而下，便得算飾畫家費理湘的李琛，雖然他未免太油滑了些，有些近乎「洋裝新戲」裏的油滑少年，然而比他更油，更近乎洋裝新戲裏的小丑的，還有飾汽車夫的那位先生，而李琛的比較自然的動作和說話，總比別人那種僵硬的機械的動作要强得多。飾保羅的白雄飛，以及飾「巧格姐的劉心珠，動作和說話都近於機械，而飾「巧克力姑娘」的父親的陳大悲和福姐的父親的朱人鶴，那種有時厭緊了嗓子，有時又恢復原來嗓音的說話，那種僵硬過火的動作，非常使人討厭。</p>
<p>演員的化裝，也未見佳，眼圈塗得太深更是普遍的現象。</p>
<p>比較可提的到是佈景的顏色，那種淺靑淡黃的顏色，配着這樣輕鬆的劇本，是很合適的。雖然第一二幕的顏色太土，而別的方面也欠眞實一些，不過以淺的顏色來配輕鬆的戲，使人有一種輕盈的感覺，這一點終究是好的</p>
<h3 id="c224">筏 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>—海航的故事—</p>
<p>小火輪有點象吃不消，拖着我們這幾條貨船進鴛江的時侯，顯得很費勁，吃力。</p>
<p>我們四個心裏乾着念，埋怨那死七機器電燈泡不通氣，這麽地象一條蚯蚓虫，拖呀拖的在象沒有吃飯七八天一樣地慢。這時候已是黃昏後了，太陽也逃走了，再趕不及靠碼頭，又要等明天淸早才查關，祖宗十八代的，一查關又大半天，明天大年初一還玩媽氏的玩意嗎</p>
<p>「趕不及，我整死那大烟剷。今年過年已經有點笨七，還要累到過年也過不成，那眞是天曉得了。」</p>
<p>三老爹也咬着長烟桿在着急。我們知道到別的地方去，這老傢伙是一個人看船的，這趟來梧州可不成了，九坊街什麽的有一個不知是契弟，還是契仔的親戚是他的老相好，這一次又碰着了過年，怕不是天九哇，牌九哇，玩一個痛快嗎？眞有點象老七說的—「人老心不老咧，龜仔！」誰又不是一式一樣。</p>
<p>高高的象一個砲樓模樣的地方，我們已看見了。我們也放下了一把心事。</p>
<p>「劃鬼脚，請宵夜，死七不來！」</p>
<p>我帶點挑撥的問他們，雖然貨船還要大半天才可以靠岸，可是給縛束得怕極了的心是已經開朗起來了。</p>
<p>「來！死七不來！我說：二毛錢的兩只，四毛錢一只，還有一只是白食！好不好？」</p>
<p>老七正一頭高興地嘩咧嘩咧，三老爹却板起臉孔了。—</p>
<p>「歡喜？歡喜托七咧，你們！船還沒靠岸……」</p>
<p>我們都是識趣，他還沒爽爽快快地罵，便都站了起來，老桂解了牽纜，我和五叔一邊一個的把穩了了船，便一篙一篙的撑靠了碼頭。這時候，大家都不作聲，大家部趕快地撑着，大家都存着了滿肚子的希望。</p>
<p>貨船靠了在仁和筏上，筏上的夥計們都是老朋友，招呼了一下，便弄妥了一切應做的手續了。貨在這深晚是起不了，便讓它擱一天。三老爹換上了一伴綢紗的長衫，一擺一擺地上岸去了。我們分配妥了工作，集了幾個小錢，留了五叔一個看船，我們三個吹着口哨，一步一跳的也趕上岸去「採辦」。</p>
<p>沒有靠岸七八天了，心裏帶點好奇，很象每一件東西都是那麼新奇似的，而只又是靠年底，街道上熱熱鬧鬧地哄哄的響着摜砲咧，地雷砲咧，把我們駭得象「劉姥姥進大觀園」，不知笑好咧，還是大聲地喊呌一個痛快好。老七這傢伙才怪，看了一些打扮得象戲台上的角色，臉孔象猴子屁股，跑路有點象柴花扭呀扭的女人，象著了迷，蜂狼地用各種方法去戲弄者，尋著開心。我和老桂覺得又好笑又好氣，尋不着道理，不知是誰錯，還是誰對？所以，雖然算是打好了五斤五加皮，抽着了半邊燒鴨，再加上一些鹵味咧，生菜咧，魚咧，之類，預備趕回船去，老七還是那麽捨不得。最後，我用力拍了他一下，對他說：</p>
<p>「飲了半斤，再來打野鷄，好不好？」</p>
<p>他笑着，我們也笑着。過年咧，我們都不高興誰跟誰鬧番面。</p>
<p>下了筏，筏在水面上飄呀飄的，我們又扒上了一個陰影，記起了海上的生活的可怕—</p>
<p>「去你媽的爛三代，過年還要拚命！賺了錢還小是那死七一個人請了那班契弟上陳塘，或者帶幾個紅牌阿姑上街，怕輸得到我們！要不是，我們在家裏過年，眞不知怎樣快活了，媽爛臭貨！」</p>
<p>我們的生活便象這些木砌成的筏，一年三百六十五日，月日也是放在水上，—「我們是靠水吃飯的哪！」仁和筏上的夥計把我們當成老朋友了，不過我們却最怕他提起老劉這像伙。去年五月節我們還是一起的，現在—</p>

<p>老五：我們這裹也來過了，來了一個大畔子，胖的像肥豬似的！話還沒說呢他先喘氣，當時，我眞讓他給嚇了一跳，我以為他要打人呢！</p>
<p>小魯：我們那兒來的也是他，我們沒以為他要打人，害怕是挺害怕的他的喘氣眞像抽羊角瘋似的。後來我們告訴他這年頭收成不大好，城裏的米店賣價便宜，所以買價也減低了，田租地稅又是這麽大，老實的說，自己種的田有時候都沒有米吃，那兒來的錢繳田租呀！</p>
<p>老五：那麼他怎麼說呢？</p>
<p>小魯：他們眞狠心，那個胖豬說，現錢沒有就是糧食折　也成。</p>
<p>老五：那麼他沒有聽你說自己連飯都沒有的時候那兒來的糧食呢？</p>
<p>小魯：那許多沒有心肝的畜生，他們懂得什麽人情。還管你那些，末了，面孔上很嚴厲的吿訴我們：一個星期不送到局子裏去，就派大批的人來捉你們去吃官司了！老五：唉！吃官司也只好吃官司了，我們並不是有錢抗租不繳呀！</p>
<p>小魯：是呀！管他媽的，這年頭只好到時候再說了！那麽，他對於你們怎樣呢？</p>
<p>老五：他媽的，那個大塊頭叫個人來把我們的那頂一百八十斤的母猪給拴了去了！小魯：（大笑）可以跟他配對兒了！（兩人火笑）</p>
<p>阿巧：（遠處叫）小魯，吃飯來呀，你再不來，我們都要吃光了。</p>
<p>小魯：（答應）來了，老五，你吃了飯沒有？</p>
<p>老五：我吃過了，你快點去吃吧？吃飽了再來聊天吧。</p>
<p>小魯：走，上我們那兒去，看我們吃飯，一邊面聊會兒，好不好？走了走了。（跑去）</p>

<p>老五：我們沒有玩，在那兒聊天的，大哥，您吃您的！</p>
<p>大哥：老五，你吃了沒有？就在這跟我們一塊吃了吧，省得回去去麻煩了。</p>
<p>老五：我早吃了，你們快點吃吧；回頭不然都凉了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Negotiations Between Hebei and Chahar: Rumors of Approaching Agreement, Xiao Zhenying's Consultations Bear Fruit, Two Issues Gradually Progressing, Song Zheyuan to Arrive in Beiping Within Days <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Diplomacy between Beiping, Eastern Hebei, and Northern Chahar, which had been suspended before the Spring Festival, resumed after Japanese representative Doihara returned to Tianjin from outside the Guan. He immediately exchanged views with various parties, but formal negotiations have not yet begun. Recently, Xiao Zhenying has been traveling between Beiping and Tianjin for consultations, and progress has been made on various matters. It is rumored that our side's opinion on these two issues is that the Eastern Hebei affairs require the abolition of the war zone, and the Northern Chahar affairs require the puppet troops of Li Shouxin to withdraw from the six counties and return to Doron. It is rumored that both sides' opinions have approached an agreement. According to Japanese Embassy military attaché Imai, the path to resolving the Eastern Hebei issue has made progress compared to before. Tada's arrival in Beiping is a private action and not for official business. He will return to Tianjin within days. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, 9 AM on the 5th, Xiao Zhenying and Chen Juesheng visited Doihara at the Tokiwa Hotel in the Japanese Concession to discuss the recently decided diplomatic dispute resolution plan of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council with Doihara. The consultation lasted a long time before they left. One party hopes that the Hebei-Chahar authorities will remain as before and not change their established policy, but can allow the Hebei-Chahar authorities to make slight changes within a certain scope regarding the method of implementation. Doihara originally planned to visit Beiping for a short stay on the 5th, but now he has changed his travel date and must go with Song Zheyuan after the Lantern Festival. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Song Zheyuan is scheduled to arrive in Beiping on the 8th and hold a banquet for Kawada, the commander of the Japanese Lushun Fortress, at the Political Council early on the 9th.

<h3 id="e10">The Division and Fragmentation of the U.S. Government Party <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Recently, the domestic affairs of major countries in the world have gradually entered a state of upheaval and uncertainty. The general elections in Japan and France are imminent, and the term of the U.S. president will also expire within a few months. Various parties will hold conventions to nominate presidential candidates. According to recent news, the U.S. government party has been fragmented. Representatives of the Democratic Party from 14 southern states recently held a meeting in Georgia, severely criticizing the current government for violating the party's platform and disregarding the constitution. The meeting decided that the current government in Washington is a government of the Democratic Party and unanimously supported Georgia Governor Talmadge as the next presidential candidate. Among the two major parties in the United States, the Democratic Party relies most heavily on the southern provinces, because the white people in the South deeply hate the Republican Party and invariably vote for the Democratic Party candidate in every election, hence the name "Solid South." Now that the southern provinces have expressed their opposition to the current government, not only will the success or failure of President Roosevelt in the general election in November become a problem, but also at the Democratic Party convention around June, whether Roosevelt can be nominated as a candidate will also become a problem.</p>
<p>Since President Roosevelt took office, his popularity has been lower than ever before. In terms of public opinion, according to the mock vote of the well-known New York magazine The Literary Digest, those who oppose the New Deal far outnumber those who support the New Deal. In terms of Congress, the president has lost his ability to control the senators and representatives. Although Democrats account for an absolute majority in Congress, the anti-government faction among the Democrats far exceeds the government faction. In the case of the payment of veterans' pensions, although President Roosevelt vetoed it, the anti-government faction overturned the president's veto power with a two-thirds majority and passed it. In terms of the courts, the two fundamental laws of the New Deal, namely the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, were successively ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Years of efforts were once deemed illegal, and the New Deal system, like a mirage, suddenly vanished. In terms of the party, the voices opposing the current government are deafening. Smith, the Democratic Party's presidential candidate who ran against Hoover in 1928, recently publicly attacked Roosevelt, saying that Roosevelt has violated the party's trust and damaged the party's promises to the people. The facts of the past three years prove that Roosevelt's policies are quite different from the Democratic Party's traditional propositions. Smith's attack left President Roosevelt speechless.</p>
<p>Looking at the trend of American political struggles, whether the Roosevelt government can continue is quite questionable. On the opposition side, Senator Borah has publicly stated that he is willing to be a presidential candidate. Kansas Governor Landon is famous for his thrift, and his proposal to balance the budget and reduce taxes has also been well-received by the people. If these two are nominated as candidates, they will surely be formidable opponents to the current government. Within the government party, the old guard has advocated changing the policies and personnel of the current government, believing that the current government's social policies cannot cater to the conservative psychology of the American people. Americans believe that the constitution is sacred and inviolable. Since the government's policies violate the constitution, and the New Deal faction is also calling for amending the constitution, the conservative business and agricultural circles cannot help but be suspicious and fearful, and cannot consistently trust and support the government to implement its reform agenda.</p>
<p>In the future, American politics will return to a path of conservatism and the right. People who have been in motion for a long time want to be quiet and are tired of new experiments, and have become attached to the old order. Therefore, those who criticize the current government invariably contrast the past prosperity and stability with the current decline and unease. The government is also in a difficult situation and cannot stop even if it wants to. The continuation of this kind of political struggle will inevitably make the Washington government unable to promote any active and concrete policies. At a time when the international situation is extremely serious and the actions of the United States are watched and followed by all countries, the division of the U.S. government party and the decline in President Roosevelt's prestige are indeed an unfortunate element in international politics.</p>

<p>Tianjin, the sea surface off Qin Island port is frozen for more than 300 li, extending to Little Qing Island outside the port. Ships in the port are all frozen inside. On the 4th, three icebreaker ships tried hard to break through the ice and finally opened a waterway. Ships entering and leaving the port are scheduled to avoid congestion. Yuguan also had heavy snowfall, and the climate is colder than the severe winter. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, the ice outside the Dagu mouth is getting stronger, the ice inside and outside two hundred li is as smooth as a mirror, and the thickness can be half a foot. Twelve sailing ships and five icebreaker ships are all frozen outside the mouth and cannot move forward or backward. The crew's food reserves are running out. On the 5th, the Haihe Engineering Bureau's icebreaker "Shuntian" ventured to try to sail outside the mouth to deliver water and food to the ships. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yantai, there are ice floes inside and outside Yantai port, which greatly hinders navigation. The ice inside the port is 14 inches thick, and the ice outside the port is about three or four feet thick. Although it only takes three miles for a steamer to enter the inner harbor, it takes five or six hours. The loading and unloading of goods is currently done at the Moore Wharf.

<h3 id="e21">The Future of the Naval Conference is Bleak: Difficulties in Achieving Qualitative Limitations, Possible Formal Announcement of Postponement, Japan, Germany, and the United States Compete in Shipbuilding <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>London, according to naval circles, the naval conference has virtually no hope of reaching a compromise on the issue of qualitative limitations (referring to the tonnage of battleships). The future of the conference is extremely bleak, and a postponement may be announced. It is known to this agency's reporters that before the opening of the naval conference last year, Britain made a guarantee to the United States on the issue of battleship tonnage, saying that although Britain was willing to set a maximum limit of 25,000 tons, it would accept the 35,000-ton figure proposed by the United States. This attitude of Britain has become even clearer after the meeting between the British and American delegations today. France, on the other hand, has decided to oppose it for budgetary reasons (the cost difference between 35,000 tons and 27,000 tons is as high as 300 million French francs) and political reasons. This is the situation where it is difficult to reconcile the two sides' opinions on the issue of battleship tonnage. As for the issue of inviting other naval powers to participate in the conference, there is no concrete news at this time. British officials hope that France will eventually change its hesitant attitude so that Germany can participate in the conference in some way, but they believe that if there is no progress in the discussion of the four-nation conference on the issue of qualitative limitations, the plan to invite Germany to participate cannot be realized. France is opposed to formally inviting Germany because it would be tantamount to recognizing Germany's violation of the naval provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. However, this difficulty can be avoided, provided that after the four countries reach an agreement, the draft is sent to Germany. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, according to unconfirmed reports, Germany will build cruisers to the full tonnage permitted by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of June 18, 1935, within this year, namely five 10,000-ton cruisers, totaling 50,000 tons. This has been notified to the British Admiralty by the naval attaché of the German Embassy in the UK. After the news came out, naval circles here were shocked, believing that if this is true, the naval conference will encounter difficulties again. They hope that Germany will abide by the ratio of 100 to 35 between the naval tonnage of the two countries stipulated in the Anglo-German Agreement. Since the tonnage of British Class A (i.e., 10,000-ton) cruisers is 146,800 tons, Germany can have as much as 51,380 tons. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, according to the Conservative Party's organ, the Daily Express, Japan will secretly build several 45,000-ton battleships, each equipped with 16-inch or 18-inch caliber guns, and several 15,000-ton cruisers, each equipped with 9-inch or 11-inch caliber guns, and several 3,000-ton large submarines, each equipped with two 8-inch caliber guns, and several powerful 2,400-ton class leader ships when the Washington Naval Treaty expires at the end of this year. This news was obtained from a European country that did not attend the London Naval Conference. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome: The Supreme Fascist Council of the Fascist Party held its second meeting last night (the first meeting was held on the 1st of this month), discussing the countermeasures that Italy could take if the League of Nations implemented an oil embargo. According to information obtained by this agency's reporter, the discussion resulted in the oil embargo being considered only an "unfriendly act," not a "hostile act." However, if implemented, Italy would have no choice but to withdraw from the League of Nations. According to well-informed sources, the unspoken meaning of the motion passed last night is that although Italy does not want to resort to war, it is unwilling to remain passive. Therefore, its most likely measure would be to withdraw from the League of Nations. In addition, the meeting last night also decided that if the League of Nations implements other sanctions, Italy should take strict measures in the financial field in order to concentrate financial resources to continue military operations at the front. Party members also believe that the war against Abyssinia will fully realize the ideals of the party and defeat the party's main enemies, namely capitalism and internationalism. At the meeting last night, speakers included Ambassador Grandi to the United Kingdom, but the rest were economic experts, the most notable of whom were Finance Minister Thaon di Revel, former Finance Minister Tassinari, and Agriculture Minister Rossoni. Rossoni is also a theorist of corporatism. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party held its second meeting last night at 10 PM in the Palazzo Venezia, adjourning at 12:30 AM. Prime Minister Mussolini first presented a report on the current political and military situation, which lasted for an hour. Subsequently, a motion was unanimously passed, which read, "This Council met in December last year to review the peace plan proposed by Britain and France regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and resolved to adopt a reserved attitude towards this plan. Now, observing the political trends that have occurred internationally since December last year, we deeply feel that the policy determined by this Council earlier has sufficient reason. As for the recent victories won by our army on the northern and southern fronts in Abyssinia, we believe that this is the main factor determining the shape of things. This Council now reiterates its previous intention, that Italy will surely fulfill all the objectives that the soldiers fighting on the front lines are striving to achieve with all their strength, and firmly believes that this will represent the passion filled by the soldiers at the front and the aspirations held by the people of the whole country."</p>
<p>After the motion was passed, a review was immediately conducted on the domestic situation in the three months since the League of Nations implemented economic sanctions. The amazing achievements of the Italian people in unanimously resisting calmly under the leadership of the Fascist Party were praised. Finally, the issue of the League of Nations intensifying sanctions, namely the implementation of an oil embargo, was discussed. It was decided that once this measure is implemented, Italy will take appropriate measures to deal with it. Finance Minister Thaon di Revel then presented a report, explaining the need for strict control of foreign trade, and proposed a motion stating, "The economic theory held by this party is becoming stronger and more effective due to the current situation. This Council has studied the issue of foreign trade in accordance with this theory, and believes that foreign trade is closely related to the livelihood of the people and should be directly controlled by the state of the corporatist system." At this point, Ambassador Grandi to the United Kingdom, Agriculture Minister Rossoni, and Senator Volpi successively spoke. Finally, Prime Minister Mussolini expressed his respect to his son-in-law, Propaganda Minister Count Ciano, who is scheduled to go to East Africa on the 7th of this month to lead a squadron of air force planes to participate in the war, Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace, who is leaving at the same time to command part of a Blackshirt division, and former Secretary Farinacci, who is also going to East Africa to join the air force.

<p>Geneva: The Committee of Experts on the issue of an oil embargo, appointed by the Committee of Eighteen of the League of Nations, has been discussing the five issues determined some time ago (i.e., (1) the oil consumption of Italy and its colonies, (2) its supply situation, (3) its storage volume, (4) its methods of import, (5) its substitutes). After studying the latest statistics, it is known that Italy has begun to stockpile oil since 1934, and it is now estimated that its stockpile reaches one million tons, while its annual consumption needs as much as 1.5 million tons, not including the amount required by the navy. According to people familiar with the oil issue here, the country's oil stockpile can only support seven or eight months. If a small amount of domestic production and sporadic imports from abroad are added, it may be able to support nine or ten months. Therefore, international figures believe that if an oil embargo can be implemented, Italy will be forced to reconsider the issue of peace with Abyssinia before the summer of this year. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The Committee of Eighteen of the League of Nations has previously appointed various expert committees to submit reports on the sanctions already implemented by the member states (i.e., arms embargo and financial sanctions), and to study the possibility of implementing an oil embargo. According to information obtained by this agency's reporter, the Committee of Eighteen will generally meet at the end of this month to discuss the above-mentioned reports. The report of the Committee of Experts on the issue of an oil embargo is expected to be drafted by the end of this week. Its content will be purely technical in nature, including the following three points: (1) the amount of oil currently possessed by Italy, (2) the results that the country can obtain by using oil substitutes, (3) the number of oil tankers owned by the country, and the equipment that the country currently has for this oil accumulation. The expert committee will not put forward any conclusions, but will only put forward various facts so that various governments can understand the effects that the implementation of an oil embargo can have. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Geneva: An expert on the oil embargo issue recently made a statement to this agency's reporter, saying that if the US Congress were to veto the new Neutrality Act, the League of Nations might be forced to abandon the proposal to impose an oil embargo on Italy. As far as the current situation is concerned, the US New Neutrality Act has a high probability of being vetoed. In short, even if the oil embargo is implemented, it may not be effective for a certain period of time after its implementation. There are two reasons for this: first, Italy can still use oil substitutes to replace it; second, even if the US Congress passes the New Neutrality Act to facilitate the implementation of the oil embargo, Italy may still be able to undermine this embargo. For this reason, although the Committee of Experts on the issue of an oil embargo appointed by the Committee of Eighteen has begun its work, the final result is still uncertain. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>Changchun: The situation here is tense because the Soviet Union refused to extradite the rebels of Mishan. The "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry refers to the rebels as bandits who kill and plunder, but the Russian authorities refer to the rebels as political refugees. The "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry issued an article today expressing dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Soviet Union, accusing the Soviet authorities of inciting infighting within the "Manchukuo" army to communize it, and delaying the demarcation of the Russian-"Manchukuo" border. According to news obtained today, the Soviet military authorities have declared that if "Manchukuo" or Japanese soldiers attempt to break into Russian territory to recapture "Manchukuo" rebels, inevitable consequences will occur. At the same time, the Kwantung Army General Headquarters also issued a statement accusing the Russian army of assisting the "Manchukuo" army and the Japanese-"Manchukuo" joint army in confrontation. According to unconfirmed Japanese sources, the Soviet military authorities have ordered border residents to withdraw from all important locations. The Hailar "Manchukuo" military authorities issued a statement saying that the Mongolian army has repeatedly violated the "Manchukuo" border under the instructions of the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Changchun: The Soviet side issued a statement about the Kwantung Army's intention to invade. The Kwantung Army also issued a rebuttal statement at 10 AM on the 5th. The main point is that the propaganda about the Kwantung Army's intention to invade is fundamentally wrong. If the border line is not demarcated, the disputes will only become more complicated.

<h3 id="e40">*Pravda* of Soviet Russia Comments: Stance of the Japanese Military: Opposes Fact-Finding by an Investigating Committee <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: A dispatch from Tokyo regarding the attitude of the Japanese military authorities toward the Far Eastern Army's proposal, as commented on by *Pravda*, states that if any further proof were needed regarding the fault of the Japanese military authorities in the clash at Grodekovo on the Soviet-Manchukuo border on January 30th and February 1st, it has been provided by the Japanese semi-official organs. According to their reports, the information they released was based on instructions from Japanese military leaders. They deeply fear an impartial investigation of the conflict and dread the conclusion of the Far Eastern Red Army headquarters' announcement, which stated, "Prepared to provide full assistance to any impartial committee coming to investigate the site of the incident." The aforementioned military authorities are now hastily proclaiming that they cannot accept the "proposal of the Far Eastern Red Army" to organize an impartial committee. Clearly, the Far Eastern Red Army headquarters' proposal has deeply alarmed the Japanese military leaders. The reasons they give for opposing the organization of an impartial committee to investigate the January 30th and February 1st incidents are weak and ineffective. They have not provided any proof, nor have they demonstrated what they require. If the Soviet Union had indeed "desired to incite rebellion in Manchukuo to achieve its aggressive aims," then these military leaders, being so fond of peace and justice, could have used this opportunity, through an impartial investigation, to prove the Soviet Union's aggressive behavior. Regarding their claims that the plan to organize a mixed border committee was prevented from being realized by the Soviet Union, this is even more astonishing to those who make such claims. Molotov already pointed out in the previous session of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, "Half a year has passed since our ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, proposed organizing a Soviet-Japanese mixed committee to investigate border incidents, but the Japanese government has yet to respond to this proposal." According to absolutely reliable sources in Moscow, the reason the Japanese government has not responded to the Soviet proposal is due to the obstruction of these military leaders. They are now shifting the responsibility for the failure to establish a mixed committee organization plan to the Soviet government. The purpose of their obstructing the conclusion of an agreement to organize a border committee (a committee that could prevent or restrain border conflicts) is their proposed "demarcation of the national border." They know full well that the Soviet Union will refuse to redraw the border, as the border has already been clearly defined by various treaties. Therefore, the Japanese military, while refusing to organize a border committee, demands the redrawing of the border, is attempting to undermine various methods of adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations and preventing border conflicts, and to maintain the possibility of continuing to carry out provocative atrocities on our border under the false pretext of so-called ambiguous borders.

<p>Tokyo: From noon yesterday, heavy snow fell over the Tokyo area, with wind speeds reaching twelve meters per second. Snow continued to fall until midnight this morning. By 9:00 PM last night, the accumulated snow had reached 28.5 centimeters, the heaviest snowfall in forty-nine years. Due to the heavy snow, as many as six hundred streetcars were stranded. Train services on the Tokaido Line were thrown into chaos, and trains were delayed. Streetcars stopped running at 10:00 PM. Only buses were running in the city. All other transportation was cut off. Theaters and movie theaters were deserted. By 10:00 PM, power was also cut off, and the entire city was plunged into darkness. The Tokyo Municipal Bureau of Public Works today mobilized 20,000 workers and 1,000 trucks to carry out snow removal work. Suburban trains have resumed this morning. (Dentsu dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Osaka: Due to the heavy snow since yesterday, ships have encountered disasters in the Seto Inland Sea and elsewhere. The Osaka Shosen Yunnan Maru, fully loaded with grain, was returning from Dalian when it encountered a blizzard off Cape Shio on the morning of the 5th. It sent out a distress signal. Osaka Shosen immediately began rescue operations. When the rescue ship arrived at the scene at 8:30 AM, the ship was nowhere to be seen, and it is feared that it has sunk. The fate of the thirty crew members seems hopeless. The Yunnan Maru weighed 2,210 tons, and the captain was Masaji Saito. (Dentsu dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The entire city of Tokyo has been buried in snow due to the heaviest snowfall in sixty years. All transportation within the city has been cut off.

<p>London: London cold storage workers, in sympathy with the meat market employees, went on strike today. 12,000 are currently on strike, demanding equal pay. Many meat shops have already run out of supplies today. If there are no emergency measures, all butcher shops will have no meat to sell tomorrow. Union leaders have urged the strikers to return to work, but to no avail. The strikers said that negotiations have been ongoing for eight months, but the employers have been dragging their feet, so they had no choice but to strike. The employers believe that this strike is not authorized by the union and will not reopen negotiations unless it ends. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>London: After the cold storage workers went on strike yesterday, the authorities have been working overnight to ensure that Londoners do not suffer from a lack of meat. On the one hand, they have dispatched police to protect the meat market, and on the other hand, they have sent trucks to load meat and distribute it to various cold storage facilities to ensure a continuous supply to retail meat shops. Although the strikers have pickets stationed in various places, there has been no hostile behavior. The authorities have transferred 600 police officers from other locations to central London to prevent disturbances. At night, a truckload of meat attempted to leave the market but was blocked by the strikers. The labor unrest has now spread to the Aldgate meat market, where there are also a hundred strikers.

The assassin, 26 years old, named Frank Furt, went to the police station to surrender after the assassination, claiming that he was not a communist, but he loathed the German National Socialist system, so he intentionally shot and killed Gustloff. The incident occurred this afternoon. The assassin went to Gustloff's residence, spoke a few words with Gustloff, then drew a pistol and fired five shots, killing him. It is said that Gustloff was very active in Switzerland, specializing in gathering information about German expatriates and devising plans to lure Germans living in Switzerland across the border.

<p>Bern, Switzerland: The leader of the Swiss National Socialist Party, Gustloff, was suddenly assassinated at his residence in the city of Davos and died on the spot. The killer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, surrendered to the police tonight. According to his confession, his name is Frank Furt, he is a Yugoslavian, 27 years old, studying medicine in Switzerland. He confessed that the assassination was politically motivated, aiming to strike a blow against National Socialism. Gustloff was a German, proficient in science, and had worked at the Davos Observatory for fourteen years. He was a veteran member of the National Socialist Party and had been very active in Switzerland, gathering German expatriates to organize National Socialist Party groups. He had been fiercely attacked by some socialist newspapers here, demanding that the government order him to leave the country, but the government did not grant the request because Gustloff's activities had not exceeded the bounds of the law. The sudden assassination is feared to have an impact on both Germany and Switzerland. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Washington: During the House Appropriations Committee's study of the Treasury Department's budget, Chairman Buchanan, a Democratic member of the House, expressed doubts about the success of the Treasury Department's silver purchase plan. Buchanan said, "I know that it is very good to purchase enough silver to achieve an appropriate ratio of gold to silver, but a foundation must first be established so that the commercial nations of the world can use the bimetallic standard. Now that the Treasury Department cannot achieve this goal, I truly do not know what benefit there is in buying silver, other than raising the price of silver in some silver-producing areas in the country." Beforehand, Director of the Budget and Undersecretary of the Treasury Bell had also stated that the silver purchase plan was not making progress. Buchanan then asked the Treasury Department how much more silver it needed to purchase to achieve a gold-to-silver ratio of 3:1. Bell replied, "This is difficult to calculate, because the Treasury Department's cash reserves are also increasing at the same time as it purchases silver, so progress is very slow, and it is still far away." Treasury Secretary Morgenthau informed Buchanan that the silver purchase law was an "absolute order," so it could not be stopped until the goal of a gold-to-silver ratio of 3:1 was achieved.

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt announced today that he has ordered the cancellation of government loans, as the situation has gradually recovered, so there is no need to grant such large loans anymore. The President added that this action is not immediately a government austerity policy. However, the financial community is paying close attention to this order, given the recent propaganda of inflation, the weakness of the dollar exchange rate, and the opposition of Congress to new taxes, etc. The President explained that this move is not to "recall" funds that have already been designated, but to cancel the amounts previously approved. For example, the Home Owners' Loan Corporation has now become a collection agency and no longer needs to grant loans. At the same time, President Roosevelt announced that he has convened the heads of various relief agencies to meet tomorrow, leading some to speculate that federal government spending may be greatly reduced. (Kokumin dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Political circles close to Congress stated today that the House's propaganda of inflation will fail due to opposition in the Senate or a veto by the President. Even though the atmosphere of inflation is strong, even if the President vetoes it, the House may not be able to get two-thirds of the Senate to override the President's veto. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Board will visit Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today, at which time they will discuss the financial situation and issues such as inflation. Although the Federal Reserve has the power to control credit inflation, it has no power to interfere with currency inflation. Observers familiar with the situation believe that while President Roosevelt opposes currency inflation, the United States may not be able to avoid credit inflation. The huge deposits in banks now may flow into the real economy and encounter a boom similar to the era of President Coolidge. Some experts believe that credit inflation and currency inflation are equally dangerous, the difference being that the latter is triggered immediately, while the former waits to explode later.

<p>Budapest, Hungary: In the past few weeks, the capital's detective team has been paying attention to communist activities and is currently destroying the Communist headquarters. Fifteen leaders have been arrested. The cracking of this case proves that the previous suspicion that communist propaganda was produced by experts. Among those arrested is West Keiss, who is well-known in Hungary because he participated in the Soviet dictatorship in Soviet Russia in 1927 and is on the wanted list. Keiss was convicted and imprisoned at that time, then escaped to Soviet Russia, and was sent back to the country by Soviet Russia under the guise of a low-ranking cadre. Bela Kun had used the most brutal means to organize the Hungarian Communist Party and rebel against the government. The evidence obtained this time shows that all the current disputes are related to Bela Kun in Moscow. One of his accomplices is Dr. Veilu, a most prestigious physician in the capital's sanatorium. In the underground room of Dr. Veilu's residence, not only were countless propaganda items hidden, but also many false passports, communist lists, various reports sent to Moscow, and large amounts of foreign currency. According to detectives, there was a special envoy coming and going when Moscow entered the Hungarian capital, so this organization can also be said to be performing military espionage work at the same time. The remaining arrested leaders include a well-known artist, a senior insurance company executive, a female doctor, and a vocational school lecturer. (Kokumin dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e49">How to Improve Students' Math Scores? Professor Ren Mengxian of Great China University (Part 2) <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Lecture to Secondary School Students Nationwide on January 14th and 16th)</p>
<p>Based on several relative principles in mathematics teaching—synthesis and analysis, deduction and induction, reasoning and experimentation...different theories have formed various teaching methods: such as (a) examination style, which makes students familiar with the assigned teaching materials, and teachers can evaluate their merits through quizzes or written tests; (b) recitation style, which allows students to demonstrate what they have learned, either by reciting theorems or summarizing and presenting, and teachers can point out right and wrong at any time; (c) lecture style, which allows students to listen to the teacher's lectures, with everything centered on the teacher's actions; (d) discussion style, which allows students to openly discuss problems, with the teacher only acting as the chairman; (e) individual guidance style, which allows students to seek guidance from the teacher based on their own insights or questions, and the teacher provides individualized guidance according to their needs; (f) self-discovery style, which allows students to conduct further research based on their existing knowledge, striving for self-discovery; (g) group experimentation style, which divides students into small groups to obtain necessary new knowledge through practical observation and testing, similar to other natural sciences.</p>
<p>These are all teaching methods used by mathematics teachers in the classroom, but which one is the most suitable? Let's compare them now.</p>
<p>(1) Styles a, b, and c These three styles, although said to be rigid, passive, and restrictive to the spirit for students, seem unsuitable for teaching, but if used well, each has its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(1) Advantages of effectively using the examination style: (I) It can cultivate students' habit of independent study, so that they do not rely on the teacher for everything; (II) It can make students not afraid of trouble and work patiently; (III) It can arouse students' competitive spirit, thereby promoting their progress.</p>
<p>(2) Advantages of effectively using the recitation style: (I) It can use the opportunity of performance to correct students' errors in language and writing. It is a common and unavoidable fact that mathematics teachers fulfill the obligation of revising students' language and writing on behalf of Chinese and even foreign language teachers. (II) It can enable students to gradually develop their creative abilities in the practice of retelling. For example, students can be asked to explain the propositions related to solid angles by comparing them with the theorems of plane triangles. (III) It can provide a clear and confident concept for students with relatively vague understanding and scattered thinking, such as the properties of the nine-point circle, the formula for the sine or cosine of a half angle. The proof procedure is relatively tight, so students may be asked to reprove it once.</p>
<p>(3) Advantages of effectively using the lecture style: (I) It is convenient for systematic or regular narration, such as the classified presentation of solutions to simultaneous equations—from addition and subtraction to elimination...to expansion using determinants. (II) It is convenient to conclude matters that have already been explained above, such as making a general discussion after calculating the numerical values of the roots of a quadratic equation separately. (III) It is convenient to extract outlines and clearly indicate summaries, such as pointing out that the propositions of spatial planes and lines are nothing more than parallel and perpendicular relationships. (IV) It is convenient to compare in many ways, making the results clearer, such as comparing the methods of finding the surface area and volume of cylinders and cones with those of prisms and pyramids, which can best make students' concepts clear. (V) It is convenient to review known things, making it easier for students to accept newly taught theories, such as reviewing the properties of spherical geometry before teaching spherical trigonometry.</p>
<p>(2) Styles d, e, and f These three styles, although said to be flexible, automatic, and adapted to personality for students, seem quite suitable for teaching, but if not used well, each has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>(1) Disadvantages of not using the discussion style well: (I) Learning opportunities are difficult to equalize. (II) Students' expressions of thought may not come from true knowledge and insight, and it is easy to develop opportunistic and cunning malpractices. (III) Arguments change at every turn, often causing unnecessary disputes.</p>
<p>(2) Disadvantages of not using the individual guidance style well: (I) There is a lack of opportunities for the cultivation of group spirit, such as common mistakes, which cannot be universally brought to their attention. (II) Students are unwilling to make efforts automatically, often resorting to hypocrisy and settling for laziness. (III) Teachers work harder, but students benefit limitedly, because if the number of people is too large, there is not enough time to allocate.</p>
<p>(3) Disadvantages of not using the self-discovery style well: (I) Time is particularly uneconomical. (II) It is not suitable for more difficult or abstract problems, such as the exploration of the properties of integers, etc. (III) It is not suitable for lower grades or when starting to learn a certain subject, such as when reading geometry for the first time, with nothing to rely on, how can one learn new things by reviewing the old?</p>
<p>(3) Group Experimentation Style The purpose of using this teaching method is to concretize various theorems and methods in mathematics, just like physics, chemistry, and biology. It is indeed a latest trend, but the problems that still need to be studied include:</p>
<p>(1) Allocation of experimental materials such as the observation, measurement, and use of physical objects and figures; the creation and correction of calculation tables; and the application of graphs are all experimental materials. But how should these materials be allocated reasonably?</p>
<p>(2) Design of experimental procedures such as how to make experimental films</p>
<p>(3) Equipment of experimental tools such as ordinary tools, calculation tools, measurement tools, geometric models, and physical instruments are all necessary tools for experimentation. But how should they be equipped to be applicable?</p>
<p>From the above comparison, which teaching method is the best in space? How should it be chosen? My point is:</p>
<p>(1) Teaching methods become more refined through research, and vary according to the object. There is no fixed format, nor is there an absolute evaluation of excellence.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching methods obtained through meticulous research and practical experience are more meaningful and applicable.</p>
<p>(3) When adopting any method, it is necessary to be active at all times and make multiple connections, and avoid partiality and clinging to one kind.</p>
<p>(4) The standard for selection should be determined by the benefits obtained by the students and the results they show. The teacher's own convenience should not be considered.</p>
<p>As for whether or not to correct students' exercise books, or how to correct them? These after-class processing methods are considered difficult problems to solve by any teacher. According to the current treatment of middle school teachers, the teaching hours of teachers often exceed 20 hours per week, which means that they often teach four classes of students, with a total number of about 150 or 160 people. Now, if exercise books are collected once a week for each class, and each book has about 20 questions, then the teacher must correct at least 3,000 questions per week. If each question is assumed to take half a minute, it will take no less than 25 hours. Therefore, if teachers correct exercise books, in addition to teaching, the effort spent on after-class processing averages more than four hours per day, not to mention the preparation of teaching materials, research on teaching methods, and reviewing test papers. Therefore, insufficient time is already a major obstacle to solving this problem; moreover, exercise books are not easy to collect, and their contents often have the drawbacks of plagiarism and similarity; and it is not yet known whether students pay attention to reviewing after correction. Therefore, some people say that correcting exercise books wastes a great deal of labor for teachers, and the result is proofreading for students who plagiarize, which does not enable them to do the exercises. However, how students learn mathematics, I said before, cannot be done without sufficient practice; and the improvement of students' grades depends entirely on the teacher's detailed guidance on a daily basis; and since students have been urged to do the exercises, what is the point of not correcting them? Therefore, the collection and correction of exercise books are necessary, for the sake of teaching effectiveness and student progress, there is no doubt. But whether it is possible for teachers to correct depends on whether teachers can flexibly use the correction method and whether they have legitimate teaching and appropriate training for students. Such as</p>
<p>(1) To alleviate the difficulty of insufficient correction time, teachers can select one-third or one-quarter of all exercise books (or all the exercises in each book) for detailed correction after collecting the exercise books, and the rest can be briefly reviewed, and then the one-third or one-quarter can be corrected in detail next time. By correcting in this way in turn, teachers can save at least half of the time, and students can get the benefit of five or even six detailed corrections per semester. Why should teachers be afraid not to do it? But once collected, it must be returned in the shortest possible time. Otherwise, the students have forgotten how a certain question should be calculated after a long time. Although the teacher's correction is detailed, the students do not pay attention.</p>
<p>(2) Supervise students to practice on time, and eliminate the drawbacks of mutual plagiarism. Teachers must have a definite study on teaching methods. On weekdays, they have cultivated students' habits of previewing, and do not allow them to be neglected; they also value class work, and do not allow them to give up; and they carefully select useful exercises, and do not make them excessive; then students will be happy to accept the teacher's instructions, and practice tirelessly. Teachers also strictly stipulate examination methods. In the event of unconscious plagiarism, both parties will be canceled at the same time, and then the cultivation of the mind will be carried out. On the one hand, the interest of students in striving for progress will be aroused, and on the other hand, the concept of independent self-help will be cultivated to develop the spirit of truthfulness and integrity. Then students will be ashamed of plagiarism, and the effect of the so-called unity of teaching and training can be realized here!</p>
<p>Third, the expression of spirit Education is a spiritual career. If you want students to have good grades, teachers must have rich knowledge and appropriate teaching methods, and they must also have a full spirit. There are three aspects to the expression of spirit:</p>
<p>(1) Interest Students learn mathematics, they must have a good interest. Teachers teach mathematics, they must have a better interest. Ordinary people who engage in a profession often complain about one line in another line. If teachers also have this tendency, it will have a great impact on the students' minds. Therefore, teachers must have a professional interest and a love of work. Since they have already taken this as a career, they should concentrate on it and not have other thoughts.</p>
<p>(2) Attitude Whether the teacher's meaning can be exercised on the students does not depend on the teacher's strictness in supervision, but on whether the teacher's attitude can win the students' belief. Therefore, the teacher's attitude must be (1) solemn and upright fair treatment, lawful treatment, lawful and not biased. (2) Tense pace, responsible for things. (3) Sincere and patient persuasion, with sympathy.</p>
<p>(3) Physique A full spirit resides in a healthy physique; and the task cannot be accomplished without the physical strength to take on others. Therefore, teachers' physiques must pay attention to exercise, so that they are healthy and strong, then the work can be completed, and it can also be a model for students</p>
<p>To summarize what has been said above, my conclusion is:</p>
<p>(1) An ideal teacher must have strength and also have methods.</p>
<p>(2) Only with strength can there be methods. Teachers with insufficient strength, no matter how many methods they have, are ineffective.</p>
<p>(3) Only teachers with noble personality and full spirit can use their methods, develop their strength, and complete the purpose of teaching.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Mr. Hu Hanmin arrived in Guangdong, various heads of organs and representatives stationed in Guangdong have been vying to pay their respects, but he has been unable to receive them. On January 30, he received heads of party, political, and military organs and committee members at the Southwest Political Affairs Committee. At 9:30 in the morning, everyone gathered, including Li Zongren, Chen Jitang, Lin Yunkai, Zou Lu, Liu Jiwen, as well as committee members of the provincial and municipal governments, heads of various departments and bureaus, executive and supervisory committee members of the provincial and municipal party headquarters, and senior officials of the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Council, totaling more than fifty people. Hu then expressed his long-held views on the party and the country, followed by speeches by Chen Jitang and Li Zongren. The meeting adjourned at about 11:00. After the meeting, Hu rode to the headquarters of the First Group Army to visit the senior officers of the headquarters, conversing for twenty minutes before taking his leave. He then went to the provincial government, where Lin Yunkai and Liu Jiwen led the heads of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government to greet him respectfully. Hu inquired in detail about the three-year administrative plan and various new constructions in Guangdong province, which Lin Yunkai and Liu Jiwen explained separately. At 11:50, Hu received representatives of overseas party branches and representatives of various provinces in Guangdong at the Western-style flower hall of the provincial government. More than a hundred representatives were present, and committee members of the Southwest Executive Department and the provincial and municipal party headquarters also participated. Hu immediately stood up and delivered a speech, elaborating on his own views on the party and the country. His admonition was as follows:</p>
<p>"I have been away from the province for more than four years. I am very pleased to meet with you comrades here today. Since arriving in the province, I have spoken a little too much and feel slightly tired. Therefore, I have followed the doctor's advice for the past two days and rested a bit, which has delayed the meeting. I apologize for this. All of you comrades present are party affairs workers, so what I say today will also focus on party affairs. I hope you will carefully consider it. When I decided to return to the country, I received a warm welcome from comrades and compatriots in Guangdong and Hong Kong. The enthusiasm of this welcome is unprecedented. I have often said that this may be 'the meaning of love me, love my dog.' They are concerned about the crisis of the country and eagerly hope that people like me, who have always cared about national affairs, can resolve it. Therefore, the welcome of comrades and compatriots to me and the problems they seek to solve mainly fall into two categories. The more urgent and temporary one is how to resolve diplomacy, and the more gradual and long-term one is how to reorganize party affairs. When I was in Europe, comrades at home and abroad asked me about this one after another. I told them with two sentences: 'The party should be restored to a party with principles and spirit, and the government should be reformed into a government with responsibility and ability.' If we talk about the party in terms of the party, then our party has only a shell left, without any so-called principles and spirit. When the Premier created the party, he first called it the 'Chinese Revolutionary Alliance,' then the 'Chinese Revolutionary Party,' then the 'Kuomintang,' and finally today's 'Chinese Kuomintang.' Its essence is 'revolution,' and 'Chinese Nationals.' The Three Principles of the People invented by the Premier are: first, nationalism; second, democracy; and third, people's livelihood, all of which are closely related to the 'people' of the nation. Therefore, the Chinese Kuomintang is actually a 'Chinese National Salvation Party' or a 'Chinese People's Salvation Party.' Every party member must go deep into the people and carry out the principle of saving the country to conform to the original meaning of the Chinese Kuomintang. However, the current situation is not like this. People who criticize our party say, 'I only see party headquarters, but I don't see party members.' I would go further and say, 'I only see committee members, but I don't see party members. Whether there are party headquarters is still questionable.' If the party has no party members, or the party has party members, but in fact, it is as if they have lost their existence, then this so-called party has actually lost its substance. The Premier built the party to build the country and even to govern the country. Therefore, the Chinese Kuomintang is the key to initiating all revolutions. I have always advocated that to save the country, we must first save the party. What is the party? To put it plainly, it is to gather comrades who believe in the Three Principles of the People under an organization, pool our wisdom and efforts, and fight for the principles. Therefore, to become a party member, to become a comrade, the only essence is 'sacrifice' and 'obligation.' Since the Alliance Association, our party has used this spirit to overthrow the Manchu Qing and establish the Republic of China. At that time, if comrades were not careful, their lives and property would be sacrificed. Therefore, party members were mostly people with outstanding ambitions and firm integrity. At the beginning of joining the party, they had already decided to devote their lives to the party and the country. The past spirit of our party is vastly different from the past reality. 'Obligation' is changed to 'right,' and 'sacrifice' is changed to 'seizure.' The spirit is lost, only the form remains, and the promotion of the principles is no longer hoped for. Today, the country is in danger, but the party comrades are lax and indulge in pleasure, almost forgetting their duties to the party and the country, and the spirit of sacrifice and dedication. It is truly a great danger to the country. I have been in Europe for six months, all in remote villages, just recuperating. However, in Germany and Italy, I also carefully examined their party affairs. Although their principles are different, and the national situations are different, the tense and serious spirit of their party members is far beyond what our party can achieve. The ancients said, 'In the affairs of the people, take the lead in your own person, and defend them with your own person.' Revolutionary party members should all be like this. The party members in Germany and Italy do have this kind of image. Their tasks are more important than ordinary people's, their work is more complicated than ordinary people's, and they have no power. The party's principles and spirit are expressed in this way. In Germany, when the party issued an order that each party comrade should only eat one piece of meat per meal for the sake of frugality, the party members advocated it, and the whole people followed it, so that restaurants everywhere only sold one piece per customer per day, and no one failed to comply with it. Although this is a small matter, its discipline and spirit are truly admirable. Just from this one point, we can generalize the rest. The so-called taking the lead and working hard, there is nowhere that they do not go to the extreme. I ask, can our party do this? If our party cannot create this kind of ethos and restore the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the Alliance Association era, the principles will have no way to be promoted, and the party and the country will have no way to be saved. I have compared the party to an army, meaning that it must be like an army, becoming more and more refined through training. I have also compared the party to a congenital state, meaning that it must be built into a future state with a spirit of order and seriousness based on a certain direction. I have also compared the party to a school, meaning that comrades are like classmates, and their research on revolutionary principles and exploration of revolutionary strategies can be new day by day and month by month. I have also compared it to a family, meaning that comrades can be loving and sincere to each other, trust each other, and help each other, and work hard for revolutionary work. I deeply believe that only in this way can the party have life, can the principles be promoted, and can the country have hope of revival. Therefore, the body and spirit of a person may sometimes decline, but the life of the party must become more and more abundant. Guangdong is the revolutionary base of our party. I think back to the difficulty of creating our party and the hardship of the Premier's dedication to the revolution. All kinds of hardships were personally experienced by me. Therefore, I especially want to express my deep expectations for the reorganization of party affairs. I sincerely hope that the party affairs workers in this province and city can understand the original meaning of the creation of this party, deeply observe the current crisis of this party, carefully examine the current tasks of this party, and, based on the meaning of 'Please start with me,' strive to reform, so that the reorganization of this party's party affairs can start from this. This is my hope." (January 30)</p>
<h3 id="e81">General Supervisor Chiang's Speech: The Mission of the Anti-Smoking Association; Remarks at a Meeting of the Anti-Smoking Association <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing News: The Anti-Smoking Association held its first meeting on February 1. General Supervisor Chiang attended and delivered a speech entitled "The Mission of the Anti-Smoking Association." The original text of the speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>"I just heard Secretary-General Li (Jihong) report on the progress of anti-smoking in recent years. Although there has been progress year by year, it has never achieved the expected results according to the original plan. This is something I feel very ashamed of and very sorry for the country. Today, national leaders from all walks of life have gathered here to discuss anti-smoking at this critical moment for the rise and fall of the nation. I will take this opportunity to offer a few personal opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Danger of Opium is Greater Than Foreign Aggression <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that opium must be banned, and the continued implementation of the ban has been going on for a long time. However, because anti-smoking has never been thoroughly done in the past, people generally regard it as commonplace. On the one hand, they always say that opium must be eradicated, and on the other hand, they always think that it is very difficult or even impossible to eradicate opium. It is because of this contradictory psychology and reality that people who handle anti-smoking affairs often start with great enthusiasm, determination, and courage, but later gradually become passive and discouraged, and even end up with no results. Therefore, if we want to eradicate opium in the future, the first thing we must do is to break this old and wrong concept, to recognize that opium can definitely be eradicated, and to be determined by ourselves to thoroughly eradicate it. Secondly, there is another common misconception that the current crisis of the country is first foreign aggression and second opium. However, foreign aggression is external invasion and oppression, while opium is internal degeneration and suicide. Therefore, in terms of the nature of the situation, opium is many times more dangerous than foreign aggression. Moreover, the coming of foreign aggression is due to our own internal chaos, corruption, and weakness. If we can be determined to cultivate our spirit, revitalize our spirit, improve our internal affairs, and enhance our national strength, there are of course many active construction projects to be done. However, due to the limitations of talent and material resources, it is often not easy to carry out active construction projects. Therefore, on the negative side, removing the ills is the way to promote benefits, which is also a way to achieve twice the result with half the effort. When it comes to negative removal, the most urgent and important thing is of course to ban smoking. If anti-smoking is not effective, all other political construction work, no matter how hard we try, will not be effective. Therefore, we must all see the danger of opium as greater than foreign aggression, and recognize that eradicating opium is the first priority for improving internal affairs and revitalizing the country.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Concerning National and Ethnic Personality <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The importance of anti-smoking is such, but the agencies that have been in charge of anti-smoking in the past have often been nominal or have started strictly but ended loosely. They started with more serious work and stricter bans, but later gradually declined and eventually became completely equivalent to non-ban. We cannot say that this common situation has completely disappeared until recently. The establishment of our Anti-Smoking Association this time can be said to be the final test of whether China's anti-smoking can succeed, and it is also the most recent test of whether the personality of our nation and country can stand in the international community. Because the international community wants to see what other people can do, whether we can do it, and whether we can put into practice what we say. In short, it wants to see whether our nation and country have a noble personality of independence and self-reliance. It only needs to see whether our country can eradicate opium from now on. Therefore, if we want to win personality for the nation and the country, we must ban smoking as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Government and People Work Together <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Gentlemen, you have always sacrificed everything to seek national and people's welfare. Of course, you have special enthusiasm for anti-smoking. As for the government, I dare to be responsible for stating that the government has absolutely no intention of collecting taxes in disguise or extending the tax period for any financial convenience. The government's intention is absolutely to find a perfect and effective way to achieve the goal of eradicating opium and eliminating smoking as soon as possible. However, because the situation in China in all aspects is relatively special, it is indeed not easy to thoroughly achieve the goal of anti-smoking if we rely solely on the government's efforts. Because there are many places, (especially the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin) and many situations, (especially foreigners selling drugs in China) that the government's power cannot fully reach. Therefore, in many situations, it is more effective to rely on the power of society than to rely solely on the power of the government to ban smoking. If the leaders of all walks of life in the society can take responsibility for anti-smoking and work together, this power will be ten times greater than that of the government. For example, there are more than twenty gentlemen present today. If each person can directly or indirectly fulfill the responsibility of propaganda, persuasion, supervision, and execution, whether at home or abroad, whether to the government or the people, this power will definitely be more powerful than that of ordinary two hundred thousand people. Therefore, I hope that everyone can carefully discuss a perfect plan at this meeting. In the future, everyone should assist the government to work together consistently, with the greatest effort, to declare war on opium, in order to achieve the goal of eradication.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Assist All Provinces to Eradicate Thoroughly <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Again, we have made progress every year in anti-smoking recently. In addition to the special effectiveness of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the tobacco planting areas in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the northwest provinces have also been sharply reduced. Even in Sichuan, which used to produce a lot of tobacco, the area allowed to grow tobacco has also been reduced from more than a dozen counties to ten counties. However, we must know that in order to maintain these achievements, especially to achieve the goal of thorough anti-smoking throughout the country, the government and leaders from all walks of life in society must continue to step up their efforts. In particular, we believe that the highest officials in many places are definitely not greedy for tax revenue, but in fact, they lack active determination and cannot use a pragmatic spirit to eradicate opium. Especially in remote provinces, they do not know that the interior has been strictly banned, so it is inevitable. If this situation cannot be changed, no matter how hard our Anti-Smoking Association works, I am afraid that most of the work will be equal to empty talk on paper and will be difficult to achieve practical results. Gentlemen, you all have a long-standing reputation in various places and in all walks of life. I hope you will pay special attention to this point, and encourage and assist the chairmen of all provinces, especially the local officials in remote provinces, directly or indirectly, publicly or privately, so that they can increase their active spirit and make special efforts in anti-smoking in the future. As for the Anti-Smoking Supervision Office, which is supervised by this association and is in charge of anti-smoking, we must of course supervise it more closely to prevent any favoritism and to fulfill its duties. In addition, with regard to the international aspect, especially the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, the foreigners directly and indirectly manufacturing and selling drugs are beyond the reach of our government's power. We can only do our best to arouse the sympathy of international public opinion and use the power of society and morality to prevent and control them, so that foreigners who sell drugs for profit will not dare to blatantly commit criminal acts.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Greatest Determination to Complete Work <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Finally, on the government side, as the President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently the General Supervisor of Anti-Smoking, I am of course the most responsible. I have just said that anti-smoking is the first priority for improving our internal affairs. If anti-smoking is not effective, it can be said that any other political construction is fake and cannot take effect. Therefore, whether anti-smoking can be effective in the future can also test the strength of our political power and can measure the success or failure of our political construction. On the one hand, I encourage myself with this, and on the other hand, I also hope that you gentlemen will especially supervise and assist the government, with unity from top to bottom, to work together, and achieve the expected results according to the scheduled time limit. In short, now, in order to complete the political construction of the revolution, in order to save the country and the nation from danger, in order to establish a noble personality for the nation and the country, and in order to improve the status of the nation and the country, opium must be eradicated as soon as possible. If we want to eradicate opium, on the one hand, the government must of course bear the greatest responsibility and make the greatest effort. On the other hand, it is even more necessary to increase the active determination of the responsible authorities in all parts of the country, to stir up the enthusiastic sympathy of all friendly countries, and to awaken the universal awareness of the people of the whole country. Then, with the same heart and the same virtue at home and abroad, with the greatest determination and courage, according to a perfect and effective plan, we will mobilize the whole body, work together, complete the work of anti-smoking, establish the highest personality of our country, and make it the basis for our national revival. This is the great significance of our opening ceremony today. I encourage myself with this, and I also encourage all of you gentlemen. I hope that everyone will fulfill their responsibilities and complete the mission of the entire association."</p>
<p>Songjiang: Handling the Registration of Smokers for Self-Renewal</p>
<p>This county is handling the registration of smokers for self-renewal. After the Inspection Committee member Mr. Ren Yingcang, entrusted by the department, and County Chief Yang agreed on various methods to promote the registration of smokers for self-renewal in various districts, they are implementing them step by step, and the results are quite effective. However, in the first district, which belongs to the urban area, the number of registered people during the general registration period is ten times more than that in the rural areas. Therefore, this time, after District Chief Shen Fuyun personally went out to investigate and squeeze, he also reached more than 500 people. It can be seen that the omissions in each district are quite considerable. Therefore, County Chief Li personally went to various townships in the north and south of Pu to carry out investigations and squeezes, and at the same time examined the progress of general administration in various district offices.</p>
<p>Jiading: Four Robbers Captured in Huangdu</p>
<p>At about 8:00 p.m. on the 3rd, four robbers in plain clothes went to the Zhengda Rice Store in the west market of Huangdu to rob. Because the store hid the secrets of banknotes, they failed and left. The store owner, Wu Bosheng, reported the information to the town public office of the town. The provincial security team stationed in the town and the water police team were dispatching teams to search. When the robbers passed by the Jinshiji Rice Store in the east market, they re-entered to rob and robbed 40 yuan in cash and fled east. According to the store owner Jin Shijun's continuous report, the town public office telegraphed the Second Sub-bureau of the South Gate Public Security Bureau. As a result, the police station captured a robber named Wu Shaotang at the West Yangliu Bridge of Huangxiang Station. The Public Security Sub-bureau captured three robbers named Chen Xiaolong, Chen Deming, and Zhu Qingcai in Zhujia Village and escorted them to the Nanxiang Public Security Sub-bureau. They also found silver notes and other items in their trouser legs. On the 4th, they ordered the client Jin Shijun to go to the bureau to identify the banknotes found. Among the banknotes, there was a 5-yuan counterfeit note, which was indeed the original stolen goods. According to the confession, they had a pistol, which they threw into the river in a hurry. Director Zheng of the sub-bureau prepared a document with the information obtained and submitted it to the county for investigation.</p>
<p>Kunshan: Key Criminals Captured in Wusongjiang Robbery Case</p>
<p>Mao Weisou, a senator of the Military Senate, moved from Shanghai to Suzhou on December 24 of last year. He hired a boat to transport goods. At about 8:00 p.m. on the 28th, when he arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River in this county, he suddenly encountered more than a dozen bandits who swarmed onto the boat, intending to rob. A bandit was shot dead by the bodyguard. Seeing that the situation was not good, the remaining bandits jumped into the water and fled. Afterwards, the case was reported to the county public security bureau for strict arrest. The bandits Wu Xiaotuzi and his wife Xue, Chen Jiaxing and other three people were arrested. It was found that there were also accomplices Wang Dalunzi hiding in the Nanshi area of Shanghai. After the detective Li sent officers to arrest the fugitive Wang Dalunzi in Nanshi, he was escorted to Kunshan for interrogation.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Wu Requests the Issuance of One-Cent Auxiliary Coins</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce: At the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees in Yangzhou the other day, Cheng Ganqing, the representative of the Wu County Chamber of Commerce, proposed to request the Ministry of Finance to mint one-cent auxiliary coins to facilitate small business people and people of the lower and middle classes. Everyone agreed and unanimously passed it. Representative Cheng returned to Suzhou on the 5th. It is said that the Provincial Federation of Commerce has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for implementation on the 4th. Regarding the issue of reorganizing the merchants' corps, the Provincial Federation of Commerce also proposed it for discussion, pending reorganization.</p>
<p>Wuxi: American Merchants Claim Compensation for Loss of Inferior Silk</p>
<p>Last year, the price of Chinese silk was active in Europe, and the market improved, so silk factories in Shanghai and Wuxi both made huge profits. However, some reeling factories only focused on rough manufacturing and did not care about overseas credit, resulting in poor quality products. Now, various American silk factories and sock factories have purchased this Chinese silk, which has had a huge impact. They have sent letters to the American Blue Yu Bi Foreign Firm, the manager of American silk exports stationed in Shanghai, claiming compensation for losses of US$87,000, equivalent to about 260,000 Chinese currency. After receiving the letter, the foreign firm turned to the Wuxi and Shanghai silk factory trade associations to negotiate compensation. At the same time, the Wuxi Silk Factory Association received a letter of warning from the secretary of the Shanghai Foreign Merchants Export Raw Silk Association, saying that the B-grade white silk produced by the French Lyon was of the worst quality, which hindered production. All silk and sock factories hated it. If they do not pay close attention to improvement in the future, they will have to buy Japanese raw silk, because Japanese silk is guaranteed to be reliable and is improving year by year. This is a hidden worry for the future of Chinese silk.</p>
<p>Changzhou: County Government Organizes Housing Donation Meeting</p>
<p>The Wu County government previously received an order from the province to reorganize the housing donation in the whole county to fill public security expenses. It ordered the public security bureau to investigate and register each household and report it. The public security bureau has completed the investigation and estimation after several months. The county government held a housing donation reorganization meeting on the 4th. More than a dozen people attended, including County Chief Hou Houzong. The discussion items were: (1) This government received an order to reorganize the housing donation. Please make a public decision on the case. It was decided to have Lin Junbao, Wang Chao, and Yu Shaozu, together with the public security bureau and the second section of the county government, conduct a preliminary review and then review it again. The meeting was adjourned immediately.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Jiahu Highway Invites Merchants to Lease</p>
<p>The Jiahu Highway is very important for transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The road bureau has been actively rushing to build it. The earthwork has been completed, and the bridges and road surface are still in progress. It is now planned to invite merchants to lease the road, as the total project is limited to be completed by the end of this month, and the construction funds are insufficient. The business of the road will be used as collateral, and 350,000 yuan will be borrowed from the merchants. The lease period of the road is about 20 years. A contract has been drafted. Once agreed upon, it can be signed and established.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Accountant Profession in China (Part 1) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yongzuo</p>
<p>(I) What is an Accountant? Although the title of "accountant" has become familiar to the public in recent years, the general public still lacks a deep understanding of the duties and functions of an accountant. Some believe that accountants are only responsible for exposing fraud and errors in accounts, while others think that accountants merely handle the aftermath of bankrupt businesses, such as liquidation. Both of these assumptions are misunderstandings.</p>
<p>These two misunderstandings are greatly detrimental to the status of accountants in society. If we reason based on these two misunderstandings, then commercial and industrial enterprises with no fraudulent or erroneous accounts, or those not facing bankruptcy and liquidation, would see no crucial need to hire an accountant. As a result, accountants would become an inauspicious presence, leading people to avoid contact or socializing with them, fearing that such interactions might suggest impending misfortune for their businesses.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if the accountant profession were limited to investigating and exposing fraudulent or erroneous accounts, or to liquidating bankrupt businesses, its role would be confined to the passive sphere. However, this is far from the truth. While a significant portion of accounting work is passive, the majority is actually active. We must understand that accountants should be engaged before any fraud or errors occur in the accounts, and while the business is still operating, so that their design and guidance can help the business thrive. This does not mean that the passive function of accountants is not beneficial to society, but rather that it is less significant than their active function and should not be overemphasized.</p>
<p>In the past, when hiring accountants in England, their remuneration was often determined by the number of frauds they uncovered. However, this is no longer the case. As businesses have expanded in scale and become more complex in their organizational structure, they have been able to adopt strict internal control systems, greatly reducing the opportunity for fraud and error, thus eliminating the need for accountants to simply uncover wrongdoings. Consequently, the role of accountants has shifted towards verifying financial status and preventing fraud and errors. Through audits and certifications, accountants ensure that financial statements accurately reflect the true financial position and operating results. Furthermore, through design and recommendations, they ensure that systems and facilities are effective in preventing fraud and errors. From this, we can see that the role of accountants initially focused on the passive aspects but has recently shifted towards the active. A certain British scholar once said, "An accountant should rather be a watchdog than a hunting dog," which conveys this very idea.</p>
<p>However, the mission of an accountant is not merely to prevent irregularities. Their greatest task lies in analyzing the development trends of a business and guiding its management policies, enabling it to thrive on a sound path. This impacts the success or failure of a single enterprise, as well as the prosperity or decline of the entire national economy. Is their effectiveness not significant? Therefore, it can be said that accountants are to commercial and industrial enterprises as doctors are to human life. If you only seek a doctor's advice when you are already sick or critically ill, it is too late. Thus, we can define the accountant profession as follows: "Accounting is a specialized profession that focuses on the organization and design before an accounting event, the temporary calculation and recording during the event, and the analysis and audit after the event."</p>
<p>The functional effectiveness of accountants is as described above. However, in our country, the accountant profession is still quite nascent. Compared to the United States and Britain, it is similar to their situation forty or fifty years ago, and the opportunities for using accountants in society are still biased towards the passive aspects, which is regrettable. In reality, at this time when the social economy is in a state of panic and business operations are facing difficulties, we should make full use of accountants to bring their active functions into play, supporting the commercial and industrial sectors to move towards a stable and healthy path.</p>
<p>(II) Accountant Qualifications To be an accountant, one must possess sufficient knowledge and experience. Therefore, most countries have relatively strict requirements for the qualifications of accountants. Let us first discuss the systems in the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain have stricter requirements for accountant qualifications, especially Britain. In Britain, accountants are mainly trained by local accountant associations. Their training methods all adopt an apprenticeship system. Those who aspire to become accountants must, after graduating from secondary school, first take a preliminary examination administered by the accountant association. After passing the examination and being admitted, they become apprentices to an accountant. During the apprenticeship, they not only do not receive any salary, but also have to pay considerable fees. The apprenticeship period is five years, but after two and a half years, they must pass an intermediate examination. After passing, they continue their apprenticeship. After five years, they must still pass an examination. After passing the examination, they can join the association and be called an "Associate." Among the above qualifications, those who have graduated from a university can be exempted from the examination and have their apprenticeship period shortened to three years. However, the so-called "Associate" is only a type of associate membership, so they can only assist accountants and cannot work independently. However, they receive a salary during the assistant period. After five years as an assistant, they can use "Fellow of Chartered Accountant." After continuing to practice for five years, they can be renamed "Member" (the American "Member" is similar to the British "Fellow"). It is clear that there is a difference in strictness.</p>
<p>Among all the countries in the world that restrict accountant qualifications, Britain should be considered the best, followed by the United States. In other countries, such as Germany, examinations must also be taken. However, the accountant examination is administered by the Chamber of Commerce. Those who wish to become accountants, after passing the examination, can take an oath in the Chamber of Commerce and be called sworn accountants. In France, two examinations and five years of practice are also required before being recognized as a public accountant. The regulations are announced by the government. However, in Japan, although all other cultural relics and systems can imitate Europe and the United States and are more developed than our country, the accountant profession is later than China. In Japan, accountants are called "Keirishi." The Keirishi Act was officially promulgated in 1927 (Showa 2), dividing it into examination and review categories. However, because the qualifications for review are too broad, the number of people is very large (reaching more than 7,000 by the end of 1935), and the types of people are extremely mixed, resulting in the social credibility not being as solid as in Britain, Germany, and France. However, due to strong opposition from all parties, the Keirishi Act may also be revised in the near future.</p>
<p>The first promulgation of the Accountant Regulations in our country was in September 1918. At that time, I introduced it in the "Banking Weekly" and commented on the advantages and disadvantages of the system. However, because the qualifications at that time required graduation from a university business school and five years or more as the chief accountant in a bank or company with a capital of more than 500,000 yuan, it was too strict. Therefore, by July 1921, only 13 people had obtained accountant certificates. In July 1923, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, considering that the regulations were too strict and hindered the development of the accountant profession, revised them. Those who had one of the above two qualifications could register as an accountant. After this revision, because the restrictions were suddenly relaxed, dozens of people were added in a few months, most of whom obtained certificates based on experience. Those who graduated from schools also mostly failed to have sufficient study in accounting subjects. Therefore, although the number of people increased temporarily (a total of more than 250 people by 1926), they contributed little to the development of the accountant profession, and the number of those who actually practiced was very small. Until the establishment of the National Government, on the one hand, it was considered that the restrictions on accountant qualifications in the past were too broad and could not be trusted by the society, so the Accountant Registration Regulations were promulgated, adopting strict principles, with examination as the principle and review as the exception. At the same time, because domestic industrial and commercial enterprises gradually showed an active trend, although the accountant laws and regulations were revised twice by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry, the restrictions on qualifications were still focused on both knowledge and experience, and the number of accountants in the country also increased significantly (statistics showed that it had exceeded 1,400 by the end of 1935). It is a great blessing to see that the accountant profession in our country will have a healthy development.</p>

China is a world-renowned ancient country, which I have always admired. There are quite a few Chinese residing in Brazil, and their various businesses are doing well. The relationship with the people of my country is also harmonious. The relationship between China and Brazil is close. In the future, we should strive to improve it. On my way to China, I passed through Japan, which was purely a transit. I did not meet with any Japanese officials. After arriving in Shanghai, I will rest first. When Chairman Lin schedules a meeting, I will go to Nanjing to meet him and present my credentials before going to Peiping to take up my post."</p>
<p>Mr. Lago's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Mr. Lago is not tall, but very energetic. When he arrived yesterday, he wore a dark blue serge casual suit and a beige straight woolen coat.

<h3 id="e97">Cai Zengji, the New General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Will Take Office on the 10th <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since Liu Hongsheng and the supervisors resigned from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, all parties have tried to retain them without success. Now the government has approved the resignations of Liu and others, and appointed Cai Zengji as the General Manager and Tan Boying as the Deputy General Manager. Cai is scheduled to take office. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rushing to Complete the Handover Since submitting his firm resignation, Liu Hongsheng has organized and classified the documents for handover. Starting on the 1st of this month, he ordered that all cases, whether completed or not, be cataloged and compiled into detailed registers to facilitate handover to the new appointees. After the Executive Yuan passed Resolution No. 284 yesterday, approving the Ministry of Transportation's request to appoint Cai Zengji as the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Liu Hongsheng ordered all departments to complete the handover of cases by the 7th of this month. Therefore, all departments are very busy.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Take Office Cai Zengji, the new General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, is the Director of the Finance Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government, a returned student from the United States, and has served as the Director of the Two-Roads Bureau. Deputy General Manager Tan Boying is the Director of the City Ferry Bureau, a returned student from Germany, and a specialist in engineering. Yesterday, the General Manager's Office received a notice from the new General Manager, approving him to take office at the Bureau at 9:00 AM next Monday (the 10th of this month). All Bureau personnel must complete the handover cases before the 8th so that the new General Manager can take over on the 10th.</p>
<p>He Resigned He Molin, the head of the Business Department, a returned student from the United States, has served as the Director of the Wuhan Branch of the Bank of China and the Head of the Business Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Two years ago, when the government purchased American cotton and wheat, He was specially sent to the United States to take charge. He has also resigned recently and has been appointed by the Ministry of Railways as the Director of the Accounting Office of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and ordered to take office immediately. He plans to go to Nanjing immediately to meet Minister Zhang before taking up his new post. The Bureau's colleagues originally planned to hold a farewell banquet for him at the New Asia Hotel today, but He has declined.</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet for Liu Since Liu Hongsheng took office as the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company three years ago, the business has developed considerably. The newly built "Sihai" ship has a net income of 570,000 yuan per year from passengers. The appointment of various cadres has also been very competent. Now that Liu has decided to resign, due to systemic reasons, the various cadres will submit their resignations together. Cai may retain the capable personnel in various departments to assist him. The entire staff has decided to hold a grand farewell banquet for Liu Hongsheng and the supervisors to express their appreciation.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Ports of Yantai and Weihaiwei Have Been Frozen in Succession, and the Northern Shipping Route is Almost Cut Off <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Baihe River in Tianjin was frozen first, and the sea off Dagu Port has been frozen for more than 100 miles since January 15, blocking the entire shipping route. More than a dozen merchant ships have been surrounded by ice. The Tianjin icebreaker has been damaged twice while rescuing the ice-trapped ships. It has been 20 days now, and the ice has not yet thawed. Unexpectedly, the weather has become even colder in recent days, and the freezing range has extended from Dagu and Tianjin to Yantai and Weihaiwei. Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram stating that the ice outside the port of Yantai is one foot thick, making navigation difficult. The weather in Weihaiwei has also dropped to 10 degrees below freezing, which is unprecedented.</p>
<p>"Gongping" Damaged The "Gongping" ship of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which also serves as a training ship for graduates of the Wusong Merchant Marine School, has a displacement of 2,705 tons, a length of 320 feet, a width of 64 feet, and an engine power of 2,020 horsepower. It was built in 1894. It was originally scheduled to go to Yantai. On the 4th of this month, when it sailed to Zhifu, there was already ice at the mouth of the Yantai Sea. When the ship entered Zhifu, its hull rubbed against the solid ice, causing damage to the iron plates in the bow cabin, which leaked water. The shipowner telegraphed Shanghai to report the situation yesterday. The General Bureau received the news and temporarily ordered the ship to berth in Yantai for repairs.</p>
<p>Exports Also Obstructed Since mid-January, Chinese merchant ships have been blocked by ice and have stopped sailing to North China. Shanghai is crowded with passengers and goods. Therefore, British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire took the opportunity to increase freight rates by 40% and risked sending ships north. At first, they were able to use icebreaking equipment to break through the ice, but in recent days, the cold has intensified, and the ice layer has become thicker. The two seaports of Yantai and Weihaiwei have also been successively frozen, causing Swire's ships, such as "Zhejiang", "Hunan", and "Huizhou", to be blocked in the North China Sea, and Butterfield &amp; Swire's "Busheng" ship has also been frozen. Their "Lisheng" and "Dingsheng" ships have been damaged and are being repaired, resulting in eight or nine out of ten Shanghai-Tianjin liners being suspended. The Northern shipping route is almost completely cut off. Although Swire's ships, such as "Shengjing", "Ganzhou", and "Yuezhou", are still sailing, they must wait for telegrams from Tianjin in Qingdao to determine their course.</p>

<p>"Huada" Aground: The "Huada" vessel of the Huaxin Shipping Company, a very large ship, was destined to transport goods to Japan. Yesterday, the ship sent a telegram stating that Japan has been experiencing extremely cold weather recently, with abundant ice and snow, making navigation in Japanese waters very difficult. The "Huada" ran aground in the sea near Tokyo due to heavy snow. Because the ship was fully loaded with cargo, the hull is deeply embedded in the shoal. The Japanese management office has dispatched a ship to lighter the cargo, and after unloading, will attempt to refloat the vessel. Yesterday, the company forwarded the original telegram to the China Ship Insurance Association.</p>
<p>"Dasheng" Loses Anchor: The "Dasheng" ship of the Shanghai Continental Industrial Company, also loading cargo in Japan, sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, reporting to the company that the ship's starboard anchor was suddenly lost at sea outside Osaka, Japan. Details are unknown. The company has also notified the Ship Insurance Association.</p>
<h3 id="e101">National Federation of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance Requesting Exemption of Porcelain Export Tax <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Customs' Estimated Taxation of Porcelain Merchants Is Unbearable; Request to Allow Exemption According to Silk and Tea Precedent.</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "We have recently received a letter from the Jingdezhen Chamber of Commerce in Jiangxi, which states, 'Respectfully, according to the joint statement of fourteen porcelain firms including Meicheng, Shuntaixiang, Heshenglong, Tianshunxiang, Jiangxi Office Yuexingshang, Yong'an Company, Guangyihe Tongji, Ourui Ji, Wang Qingfeng, Zhan Zhenji, and He Hongji, that the customs' harsh taxation based on the estimated value of porcelain exports is unbearable, and earnestly requests that the Ministry be asked to approve the exemption according to the precedent of tax exemption for silk and tea exports in order to save the porcelain industry. We believe that Jingdezhen porcelain has a long history and is world-renowned. In recent years, it has suffered from natural disasters and banditry internally, and the pressure of foreign porcelain dumping externally. Its total output has decreased from over ten million to three million. In terms of porcelain exports, the number is undoubtedly small. Therefore, the government has reformed export taxes, exempting fine paintings and red flowers, as well as coarse white-bodied blue-and-white porcelain. Unexpectedly, after implementation, overseas trade has declined daily. The reason is that the porcelain recognized by customs as tax-exempt is all painted with foreign pigments, and the quality is too poor to meet Western needs. Merchants have consistently lost money and dare not try again. Currently, Westerners want to buy two types of lamps: lamp bottles and lamp stands, both for installing electric lights, as well as umbrella stands and flower pots and tea sets, all of which are ordinary daily necessities, but they must be painted with Chinese pigments to meet the requirements. However, customs officials in Jiujiang do not recognize the nature of porcelain. Upon seeing the above types of porcelain painted with Chinese pigments, they insist on classifying them as antiques or decorative items, and assess taxes. Porcelain merchants have repeatedly negotiated without success. Everyone knows that domestically produced porcelain is only manufactured by hand and can only deteriorate, not improve. Its models and colors are purely based on common old methods and are not imitation antiques. If the government imposes this small tax, it will affect merchants' operations and workers' unemployment. This is the first point for which exemption should be requested. The above types of porcelain are daily necessities for Westerners, and their value is very low. However, once customs officials misidentify and assess them, excessive taxes must be paid. The customs tax rate is nominally 8.25 yuan per hundred, but in reality, it has been taxed 13.6 yuan to 41.6 yuan, exceeding the original tax rate by almost five times (see the attached comparative table of customs' estimated taxation of porcelain). Not only has this porcelain export not been exempted from tax, but it has been burdened with heavy taxes. This is the second point for which exemption should be requested. The above types of porcelain are also subject to a 70% import tax when shipped abroad. If the Chinese tax bill contains the words 'antiques', the tax rate will be increased again, and no one will care about Chinese porcelain. This is the third point for which exemption should be requested. Therefore, porcelain painted with Chinese pigments is not an imitation of special antiques. If taxed based on the original cost, porcelain merchants are unable to bear it. If no measures are taken to provide relief, porcelain exports will disappear, suppressing domestic porcelain and promoting foreign porcelain. This tariff policy lacks the intention of protection. Furthermore, exports of domestic silk and tea are not only completely tax-exempt but also assisted and encouraged in various ways. Why should porcelain alone be left out? In addition to submitting a request to the Jiangxi Provincial Government and the Porcelain Industry Administration to forward the request, we hereby submit the comparative table of customs' estimated taxation of porcelain and request verification and approval. We earnestly request that you forward the request to the Ministry of Finance to approve the exemption according to the precedent of tax exemption for silk and tea exports in order to save the porcelain industry and relieve merchants' difficulties.' We find that the porcelain merchants are catering to Western needs by using Chinese pigments, but customs considers them as imitation antiques and imposes taxes, which exceed the original tax by four or five times. The merchants are unable to bear this heavy burden. Furthermore, at a time when foreign porcelain is being dumped and domestic porcelain is declining, vigorous protection is necessary to promote development. The request to apply the precedent of tax exemption for silk and tea exports is appropriate, as both are domestic products and should be treated equally. Accordingly, we enclose a comparative table of customs' estimated taxation for your reference. We earnestly request that you approve the submission to the Ministry of Finance for verification and instruction, which will be deeply appreciated.' Therefore, we hereby cable your Ministry for review and approval, earnestly requesting that you approve the precedent of tax exemption for silk and tea exports and instruct all customs offices to comply in order to save domestic porcelain. Attachment: Chairman Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Commerce."</p>

Mr. Xu Shiying presided over the meeting. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Directors Present: The directors present yesterday included Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Cheng Jingsheng, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Quan Shaowu, Zhao Jinqing, Li Zizai, Du Yuesheng (represented by Li Zizai), Lu Ganchen, Luo Qinghua, Huang Bodu, Zhang Xiaolin, Li Dachao, and Lu Bohong, as well as over twenty observers including Zhang Dachen.

<h3 id="e104">Domestically Produced Cigarette Paper Successfully Researched <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Minfeng Paper Mill Repeatedly Tested; Raising Funds for Production, Goods to Be Shipped in April</p>
<p>Dagon Agency reports: The amount of cigarettes consumed by our people each year is very large, and the cardboard for cigarette boxes and cigarette paper are mostly imported, and the annual loss is alarming. Now the Minfeng Paper Manufacturing Company in this city has researched and manufactured cigarette paper. In addition to making cardboard for cigarette boxes, it has recently imitated the outer wrapping paper of cigarettes and has been successful. It is expected that the goods can be shipped in April of this year. If it can replace foreign goods in the future, it can reduce leakage of four or five million yuan each year. The Dagon Agency reporter visited Jin Runxiang, the person in charge of the company, yesterday to ask about the imitation process. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cigarette Paper Is Difficult to Manufacture: The white paper on the outside of the cigarette, which smokers usually do not pay much attention to, is quite difficult to manufacture because ordinary paper has an odor when burned that is difficult for people to smell. If it is used to wrap cigarettes, there will be an unbearable paper smell when smoking. At the same time, the paper often has small holes. If it is used to wrap cigarettes, it cannot be smoked because of air leakage. Furthermore, the burning speed must be equal to the speed of the tobacco leaves. If the tobacco leaves have burned out but the paper has not yet burned out, it will be hollow. Or if the paper has burned out but the tobacco leaves have not yet burned out, the tobacco leaves will be scattered and cannot be smoked again. Therefore, the manufacture of this kind of surface paper must have three conditions: Paper is pure white and odorless; paper is strong and has no holes; and the burning speed is the same as the burning speed of tobacco leaves. Therefore, it is quite difficult to manufacture.</p>
<p>Three Years of Research to Achieve Success: The Minfeng factory has been researching and manufacturing cigarette wrapping paper for two or three years, and has conducted several tests and discussions with painstaking effort. As a result, it found considerable plant raw materials and water volume, and three years ago sent engineer Chen to Germany with this water and raw materials for testing. It was again sent to Japan by two engineers, Chu and Wu, last year for on-the-spot investigation. After returning to China, it was successful after several studies.</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Production, Goods to Be Shipped in April: The factory has now raised 800,000 yuan and ordered two machines from foreign countries specifically for making cigarette paper. One has already been shipped and is currently in production. It is expected that the goods can be shipped in April of this year. It is said that the manufacture of this kind of cigarette surface paper lacks certainty and is extremely risky. At that time, whether it can be completely successful and the same as imported products is still unpredictable, but the company is carefully studying and striving to improve, and it will definitely succeed one day.</p>
<p>Annual Savings of Approximately Five Million: Although cigarette paper is a small item, because there are so many cigarette smokers in the country, its consumption is quite high. The annual output of Chinese cigarette manufacturers reaches seven or eight hundred thousand boxes. Each box requires a roll of cigarette paper, so the annual consumption of cigarette paper is also seven or eight hundred thousand rolls. At the current market price of five or six yuan per roll, the annual cost is four or five million yuan. If the factory can succeed, it can reduce a leakage scar, because the factory's products can be enough for the national Chinese tobacco factory.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Silverware Industry Re-Petitions Ministry of Finance to Temporarily Maintain Original Silver Content <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Enumerating Various Difficulties and Requesting Relief</p>
<p>Dagon Agency reports: The Shanghai Silverware Industry Association previously petitioned the Ministry of Finance to amend the "Regulations for the Management of Silver Products." The reply was "No Changes to Regulations are Necessary," causing panic among the people. The association held a meeting of member representatives a few days ago and resolved to submit three petitions to the Ministry of Finance for review. It is learned that the petition was sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. The original text is recorded below. The presentation is made because upon receiving the approval, the people are in a state of panic. The absolutely different situation between handicrafts and machine work is explained in detail in a continued presentation. We respectfully request that the Ministry of Finance be compassionate and temporarily</p>
<p>Maintain the Original Content in order to Sustain Business and Secure the Livelihood of All Workers: "On January 23 of this year, we received approval from the Ministry of Finance, Qian Zi No. 8434, and various details (original text and table omitted) were also opened later, including the above six kinds of alloy materials. The color is pure white. Although the texture is slightly hard, heating and hammering will not cause difficulties and can be used for manufacturing silver utensils and silver ornaments. In addition to ordering the Central Mint to cooperate with the use of the above-mentioned alloy materials, you should also follow the previous orders of this ministry to manufacture silver utensils and silver ornaments, and still use chemical silver as raw material. If it is necessary to mix silver, you should immediately adopt the above-mentioned alloy materials, and there is no need to change the regulations. As for the request to report the pure silver content of existing silver utensils and ornaments, and the pure silver content of existing silver materials, separately as silver utensils, ornaments, and silver materials, it is still feasible. In addition to distributing it, you should also be notified. In this batch, He Meng listed two kinds of chemical raw materials, and Youjian the Ministry of Finance did not tire of giving detailed instructions. Although all the fellow traders under the association are in a state of panic, they still deeply feel the sincerity in taking care of the business. However, all the workers under the association have adhered to established methods for hundreds of years, with masters and apprentices passing on knowledge. They have studied it since childhood and used it when they grow up. Families of eight depend on it for a living. Reading the instructions, this alloy material is hard, and it is already in the knowledge of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, I did not hesitate to give detailed instructions. That is, 'But after heating, you will not feel any difficulties.' I would like to ask the Finance Department to elaborate on the difference between the high and low heat of handicrafts and machine crafts. According to</p>
<p>Scientific Chemical Raw Materials, strong boilers are used, or even oxygen is used. Dong is used for manufacturing. Raw materials are re-applied with pressure, so the color can be kept bright. As for the work of the various industries under the association, the lamp fire tubes are purely hand-hammered to become a chisel. If the raw material ingredients are hard, not only are the lamp fire tubes not enough to melt, but frequent hammering will inevitably cause peeling and unbearable. In addition, workers have shallow knowledge, how can they be said to be scientifically combined? Therefore, the difficulty and simplicity of machine craftsmanship are difficult to force to be the same. There are great difficulties in the raw material color and manual manufacturing. I have to appeal to the Ministry of Finance to grant relief. One also. The Ministry of Finance promulgated measures for exchanging legal tender on November 4 last year. There is a clear distinction between currency and goods. For currency, it is absolutely collected for national treasury management. As for silver products, which are regarded as goods, there is never permission to save. In short, the intention is to plan and take care of the people. My country has been following the trend of learning for thousands of years. Since the Han Dynasty, platinum has been valued, and business stores value reputation. All the colleagues under the association who are familiar to the population have a history of hundreds of years. The silver utensils and ornaments produced by them have always been popular with people in the society. The main purpose of the silver management rules is nothing more than</p>
<p>Prevent the Escape of Silver. The prices of finished products produced by all the industries under the Association are completely different from the price of silver. Each tael has to increase the wages of several yuan, and it is absolutely impossible to use it for transportation and profiteering. I have already stated in detail in the previous presentation. As for mixed gold raw materials, there are currently shops on the market that specialize in producing gold-plated and silver-plated products. However, the result is that most people in the society have abandoned them, and there are often cases of bankruptcy due to failure to support business. From this, it can be seen that although chemical composition can be specified on raw materials, it is feared that the trend of the people's hearts in the society will not be easily changed for a while. All the colleagues under the association and the workers of silverware in the country, or are related to business, or live by working. The actual number of millions of industrial and commercial lives depends on it. This is the second thing that we must request to be given relief to social psychology and the livelihood of employees. What's more, all silver handicrafts are not subject to leakage to the outside world, and are welcomed by the majority of noble people in the country, and are mostly treated as art and treasured. If gold and silver utensils are inevitable to be extravagant, then 30% also contains 30% of pure silver. Even if the color is slightly higher, such as the old 88, in a broad sense, it is equal to 50 steps and 100 steps. Therefore, improving the color and maintaining commerce is truly beneficial to people's livelihood and does not harm the national economy. For chemical alloy raw materials, if they can be used reluctantly in handicraft production, how dare they violate it again and again? Based on the above-mentioned difficulties, I have no choice but to re-present my words in detail. I respectfully request that the Ministry of Finance think about the livelihood of the entire silver shop industry and give extra compassion. Allow the old composition to remain as it is for the time being, maintain the status quo, or come up with a foolproof plan, indicate a way out for survival, so as to protect business and the livelihood of workers. I am so grateful to be waiting for orders. The presenter, Chuan Shengmao, Chairman of the Shanghai Silverware Industry Association."</p>

<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road received a telegram from the Shandong Yellow River Flood Relief Committee Jiang Ridian yesterday, stating that according to the report from Director Bai of Dancheng, the Yellow River water in this county has increased by 1.56 meters in recent days. The planted land has been flooded again. Many villages and villages in the Yongzhen Township area of ​​Magai have been washed away. According to a telegram from the head of Heze County, on the day of the month, Yonghe Baozhen, two townships and more than 60 villages, due to the thawing of the river water, suddenly increased by 1.56 meters. All wheat seedlings were completely submerged. There are already several villages where the gates are open. The poor people will be reborn in the severe winter. According to another telegram, since Xiaori, Lingfan has been flooding again, and the water depth in the plains is one or two feet. All the villages in the townships have been submerged, and the situation is very bleak. Furthermore, the people's dam in Juye Jing'an Xingji Dongfeng Temple was breached, and the flood rushed directly to Heze Chonghou and other townships, etc. The Shandong Provincial Government also submitted a telegram from Chief Wang of the Experimental Area, which was the same as before. After investigating the counties of Heyun, etc., the tragedy has been repeated, and it is very sad. Although winter relief has just been distributed, it is just a drop in the bucket, and the future is long. If the source of supply is not enough, it will be difficult to recover. I respectfully report it and ask for relief to relieve the suffering of the disaster victims. It is heard that the association has appointed Director Lu Bohong to go to investigate immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Tea Inspection Standards Meeting <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus of the Ministry of Industry, for tea inspection, usually formulate various inspection methods each year before the new tea is launched on the market, based on the situation of the previous year, in order to eliminate the export of inferior tea and improve the reputation of foreign trade. This year's inspection standards meeting began on the 30th of last month. Technician Dai Xiaozhou was sent from Hankou to Shanghai to conduct long-term discussions with the tea inspection personnel of the Shanghai Bureau. It is heard that in addition to the detailed regulations on the various standards for export tea and the methods for eliminating colored green tea, starting from this year, it is also planned to add a tea box elimination method. The general regulations stipulate that each tea box must be nailed with twelve corner braces, and the lead foil inside the box should be pasted with strong and clean paper, so that the tea leaves do not come into contact with the lead quality. The weight, origin, and harvesting and manufacturing time must be indicated on the outside of the box for identification. Because the board material of my country's export tea boxes is too thin, many of them are damaged when shipped abroad, and the loss is not worth it. Tea merchants from various countries have also sent letters requesting improvement. In addition to the above regulations, the two bureaus are still jointly discussing various inspection methods in order to unify inspection technology, so that the inspection results of the two bureaus are precise.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Poor Quality of Chinese Silk: Foreign Merchants Export Council Advises Improvement <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Current Sales Are Very Sluggish, and Merchants from Various States Are Waiting and Watching; New Machinery of the United Silk Mill Has Achieved Results</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: Recently, the Foreign Merchants Association, which distributes and exports Chinese silk in China, has expressed a very bad impression on foreign merchants due to the inferior quality of goods shipped to France and the United States last year. Therefore, they are advising improvement in a friendly manner. Recently, foreign sales have suddenly become silent, which is also said to be the reason. The Huashu News Agency reporter explored the details as a decision.</p>
<p>Poor Quality Affects Reputation: My country's raw silk is the only major bulk export of local products. In recent years, the price of silk abroad has been declining, so that it is no longer as prosperous as in previous years. Last year, the European and American merchants broke through five years of activity, and profit-seeking merchants took advantage of this opportunity to mix inferior goods and pretend to transport them, which has a huge impact on the future of international commerce.</p>
<p>Foreign Chamber of Commerce Makes Recommendations: The Foreign Silk Export Chamber of Commerce organized by French and American merchants in this city made a recommendation in a friendly capacity, hoping that Chinese merchants would make improvements in order to maintain their past reputation. Our belief is that silk industries in various European and American countries will stagnate this year. According to a reporter from the Huashu News Agency, the recommendation was made in a personal capacity, in terms of quality, in terms of quantity, and in terms of unifying the silk reeling vehicles. It also made a contribution.</p>
<p>United Silk Mill Has Achieved Good Results: As for the United Silk Mill formed by the National Economic Commission's Silkworm Guidance Association and various factories, the foreign merchants are very satisfied with the raw silk produced after purchasing 500 new global brand silk cars, and the results are remarkable. It is heard that people in the silk industry say that the loss of changing the old silk car to a five-eyed foreign car is very small. Therefore, the authorities of various silk factories in this city have suggested improvements to the factory owners who rent them in order to restore their reputation.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Sixth Group Wedding Held at City Hall Yesterday; Social Affairs Bureau Presented Commemorative Badges to Guests; Improved Order but Marred by Rain <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The sixth group wedding of this city was held at 3 p.m. yesterday in the City Hall auditorium. Of the 81, 88, and 93 couples, three were unable to attend due to illness, so the actual number of participating new couples was 94.  Director Wu Xingya of the Social Affairs Bureau, the officiant, was in Beijing on official business, so Mayor Wu and Zhang Binghui, the fourth section chief of the bureau, officiated. The auditorium arrangement and the order during the ceremony were more advanced than in previous years. Unfortunately, the weather was uncooperative during the ceremony, with heavy rain pouring down, preventing the audience from standing in the square. The new couples also did not follow the usual practice of walking around in front of the City Hall and were not photographed, which detracted from the grandeur. The Social Affairs Bureau, to preserve a permanent record of the event, distributed copper commemorative badges to the guests and new couples, and gold-plated marriage certificates to the newlyweds. The reporter from New Sound News has investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Auditorium Arrangement More Luxurious Than Before <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The auditorium arrangement yesterday was more luxurious and magnificent than during the rehearsal the day before, and more perfect compared to previous years. The altar was decorated with various festive ribbons, making it beautiful and dazzling. In front of the altar was a pair of large candlesticks, each with a dragon and phoenix candle. Beside the large candles were five pairs of small candles. Red silk celebratory banners hung on both walls, and a red carpet was laid from the altar to the entrance. Eight pieces of bird and animal Xiang embroidery hung on both walls of the auditorium. The master of ceremonies' seat was in the upper right corner of the altar, the officiant's seat in the center, and the National Academy of Music orchestra's seating was on the right side of the hall. The Public Security Bureau's brass band was seated on the stone steps in front of the main entrance. Shen Zuhui was the master of ceremonies, and Lin Guifu, Lei Kenan, and Tan Jiqing were the auditorium staff.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Candlelight Reflecting, Jointly Forging Good Fortune <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>At 3:25 p.m., with red candles burning brightly and music playing melodiously, the 94 new couples, who had finished dressing in the newlyweds' rest room below the auditorium, were ready. Among them, 81, 88, and 93 couples could not attend due to illness. When the wedding began, Sun Yongyi, Yan Wenkai, and eighteen students from Wan Zhu Elementary School led the way with harmony platters, incense stands, and palace lanterns, guiding the new couples into the auditorium for the ceremony. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau was in Beijing on official business, so Chief Zhang Binghui of the fourth section represented him. First, the newlyweds stood at attention. Second, they paid their respects to the party, national flag, and Sun Yat-sen’s portrait. Third, the representative of the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau read the marriage certificate. Fourth, the new couples faced each other to perform the ceremony. Fifth, the officiant issued marriage certificates and souvenirs to the newlyweds. After each pair of newlyweds went on stage to receive them, they held hands and returned to their seats. Sixth, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech. Seventh, the new couples bowed to thank the officiant, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Presented Commemorative Badges, No Photos Due to Rain <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The etiquette and order of this year's group wedding reached a state of perfection. Not only was the auditorium arrangement luxurious and magnificent, but the order in the auditorium during the ceremony was also more orderly than in previous years. The new couples all wore the prescribed formal attire: blue robes and black jackets for the grooms, white socks, and black satin shoes with white cloth soles; plain satin cheongsams, white veils, white gloves, and shoes and socks of the same color as the formal attire for the brides, holding bouquets. No one did not wear the prescribed shoes and socks, so it was extremely neat and uniform. Yesterday, the new couples were arranged to walk slowly to the auditorium from the City Hall rest room, men on the right and women on the left, along the stepped bridge. After the ceremony, when they stepped out of the auditorium, the rain poured down even more heavily, so they still changed their route, bypassing the City Hall bridge and steps, with men and women separated, women on the left and men on the right, and entered the rest room through the back door to remove their formal attire. Because of the heavy rain, and because photos had been taken the day before, the originally planned photo session of the officiant and newlyweds on the road in front was cancelled. Only firecrackers were set off next to the City Hall road to celebrate. Also, because of the rain during the ceremony, the audience in the square in front of and behind the City Hall were temporarily allowed to enter the auditorium to watch the ceremony without tickets, so the auditorium was extremely crowded yesterday, with about two thousand people, but the order was not disturbed, which was a good phenomenon. The Social Affairs Bureau specially made gold-plated marriage certificate badges and enamel commemorative badges for the newlyweds and guests as keepsakes.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Next Registration Starts on the 10th <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The City Government's group wedding initiative is to eliminate extravagant wedding customs and promote thrift. Therefore, the ceremonies are broadcast by the city's radio station to both Chinese and foreign audiences. This year's event was also broadcast by the station, with clear sound. Everything in the auditorium, even if not attended in person, was clearly visible through the station's broadcast, benefiting many. The frequency is 900. In addition, holding lavish banquets at the wedding is inconsistent with the purpose of participating in a group wedding. Therefore, all newlyweds were notified to make every effort to practice thrift and eliminate old habits. After the ceremony, according to the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau speaking to reporters, this year, the bureau attached great importance to this point, so the results were quite significant. The survey results showed that those who extravagantly held lavish banquets were greatly reduced, which was an improvement compared to the previous year and the first, second, third, and fourth years, and was quite satisfactory. Also, after this year's wedding, registration for the seventh group wedding will begin on the 10th of this month (next Monday) and will end at the end of this month. After investigation, the names of the newlyweds will be announced on March 10, and the wedding ceremony will be held at 3 p.m. on April 1.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Poisoning Case in Courthouse Guard Barracks; Friend Attempted Suicide Due to Unemployment <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Lu Jianping, a local young man, originally named Lu Yong, whose father ran a milk shop business, joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to fight during the January 28th Incident. After the war ended and the Volunteer Corps was disbanded, Lu was also unemployed. Through the introduction of a cousin surnamed Feng, he was recommended to work in a court in this city as a guard squad patrolman. It has been almost two years. Lu is honest and kind, gets along well with his colleagues, and values friendship. A man surnamed Jia, formerly a company commander in the Volunteer Corps, was an old colleague of Lu's and they were close friends. Recently, Jia was unemployed, wandered to Shanghai, and had nowhere to live, so he went to find Lu. Lu, considering Jia a good friend, could not bear to see Jia's hardship on his journey, so he provided Jia with food during the day and allowed Jia to sleep in the courthouse guard barracks at night. The two slept in the same bed. Unexpectedly, Jia, recently unable to find work, had the idea of suicide. On the afternoon of the 4th, while sleeping in the courthouse guard quarters, he took advantage of Lu's absence to drink a bottle of industrial alcohol to kill himself. After drinking it, he lay on Lu's bed, waiting for death to arrive. At about 3 p.m., the poison took effect and he groaned. Lu's colleague Le Quan entered the quarters and discovered him, lifted the quilt, and saw Jia's nose bleeding non-stop, which greatly alarmed him. He immediately reported to squad leader Shen Bingjun, who reported to the general affairs section for investigation. Lu happened to be returning to the courthouse from outside to take over his shift. He immediately helped Jia out and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, hoping to conceal the matter and avoid disputes. However, after Jia entered the hospital, the doctor learned that he had attempted suicide by drinking industrial alcohol, and because it occurred in the courthouse, it was reported to the police station for investigation as a matter of course. After receiving the report, the police station called the court president to investigate. The president learned that Lu had violated court regulations by allowing an outsider to sleep in the barracks, causing a major disaster, and was furious. He ordered Lu to be dismissed from his position and recorded a major demerit against the squad leader for concealing the matter beforehand as a warning. He also instructed the court staff not to allow outsiders to sleep in the barracks in the future. It is said that Jia entered the hospital and, after being given an enema and rescue by the doctor, his life is expected to be saved and he can leave the hospital after a few days of recuperation.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Rui Jingxian Returns from Studying Abroad, Suddenly Quarrels with His Wife; Wife Asks for Mediation to Live Together <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Rui Jingxian, a young man (around 20 years old, origin unknown) residing at No. 404, Yixia Village, Julida Road, French Concession, married Wang Cuie (around Rui's age, origin unknown) through his parents' arrangement and a matchmaker's words. It has been seven years since then. At the beginning of their marriage, they were inseparable. Two years after their marriage, Rui went abroad in the summer of the 19th year to study in France. After five years of study, he returned to Shanghai last autumn, and the love between the couple suddenly broke down, and quarrels arose. On January 1st of this year, the couple quarreled again over trivial matters, and soon a fight broke out. Rui Wang Cuie left home and returned to Ningbo. Later, she hired a lawyer to send a letter to Rui to negotiate, and published a warning in the newspaper on January 13, demanding that Rui apologize, repent, and live together. After reading the newspaper, Rui Jingxian also hired a lawyer to publish a rebuttal in the newspaper and sent a letter to his father-in-law, Wang Lanfu. Recently, Rui Wang Cuie, unsure of her husband's whereabouts, hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Second Special Court's Civil Division, requesting that Rui Jingxian be summoned to court to mediate living together. The court approved the request. Yesterday, Judge Guo Huaipu summoned both parties to mediate in Civil Court 4. The petitioner Rui Wang Cuie arrived with her lawyer, stating the previous situation, claiming that her husband had changed his attitude a few months after their marriage. After returning from studying abroad, he actually asked her for a divorce. Because she did not agree, he resorted to violence and left home to deal with her passively. On January 1st, he suddenly returned, and when asked where he had been, he shouted that he was not her husband, knocked her to the ground, and kicked her. Because she could no longer endure it, she asked a lawyer to negotiate. Now she is requesting mediation to live together, but her husband is not at home and she does not know where he has gone. As long as she knows where he is, she can go to live with him, etc. The respondent, Rui Jingxian, hired a lawyer to attend on his behalf, claiming that the respondent has always treated the petitioner with respect, and what the petitioner claimed is not true. What was reported in the newspaper was intentionally damaging the respondent's reputation. The respondent has always been at home. The petitioner's lawyer claimed that the respondent was indeed not at home and requested that both parties be summoned to court to meet in person, which would dispel opinions and implement living together. The court verified the statements and advised both parties. Because the opinions of the two parties differed, it was announced that the mediation was unsuccessful and the petitioner was instructed to formally file a lawsuit according to law. They then left the court.</p>

<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports: Wu Gaofu, a Ningbo native, nearly 40 years old, led his wife and daughters from his hometown to Shanghai to make a living at the age of 22. Due to poor circumstances, he initially only sold newspapers for a living. Five years later, he saved 500 yuan and opened the</p>
<p>Yichang Tobacco Shop at No. 203, Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession. For more than ten years, the business has been quite successful, especially last year, in the midst of the economic downturn, when it made the most profit. Yesterday was the 13th day of the Lunar New Year (commonly known as the Lantern Festival) and also the day of the Beginning of Spring. Therefore, the hostess got up early in the morning and lit incense and candles in the living room at about 9 a.m. to welcome the gods and the arrival of spring. Unexpectedly, when burning silver ingots, she was careless and sparks flew up, resulting in a</p>
<p>Sudden Fire</p>
<p>That quickly spread through the roof and became uncontrollable. Fortunately, French police officer Tao Delin, No. 596, of the Yongji Lane Patrol Police, first noticed it, sounded the alarm, and telegraphed the Songshan Road Fire Brigade for help. Upon receiving the news, the French Police Station immediately sent a large number of police officers to the scene to maintain order. After a while, fire trucks from various sections arrived and extinguished the fire in 40 minutes, at 10:05 a.m. In addition to the complete destruction of the tobacco and paper shop, the fire also spread to four houses, including the front and back buildings, attics, and pavilions, of the tenants Ma Jiu, etc. An old woman, a tenant, escaped from the upstairs with her hair completely burned, but fortunately there were no deaths or injuries. The shop had</p>
<p>Fire Insurance</p>
<p>with the Siming Savings Society, amounting to 2,000 yuan in legal tender. Therefore, when the fire broke out, a special commissioner from the society went to the scene to investigate. Neighboring shops such as Zhenji, Yongda, and Nanhua Goods Shop were also closed for precaution. The French Police Station then took the fire starter, Wu Zhifu, into custody for questioning about the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Liu Zirong and Xi Yunqing Agree to Negotiate a Divorce; Still Some Conditions Not Fulfilled; Lawsuit Withdrawal Still Pending <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Xi Xunwei's beloved daughter Yunqing, since marrying Liu Zirong, son of Liu Huizhi, the former manager of the China Industrial Bank, has been restless in recent years. She became infatuated with Wu Wenxiang, the chauffeur hired by her family, and eloped with him, renting a house and living with Wu. Later, Zirong hired a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit against Xi with the First Special District Court. He also investigated where Xi and Wu were hiding, which was discovered, and reported to the police, who arrested and detained them at the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate. Last month, the divorce case was opened for trial. The First Special Court transferred Xi Yunqing from the Shanghai District Court for interrogation. Because both families had considerable reputations, someone acted as a mediator, so the two cases of adultery and divorce filed by Liu Zirong were both postponed to allow both parties to resolve the matter peacefully outside of court. It is said that the criminal case of adultery has been settled, and Xi Yunqing has been released on bail by her family to the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate. As for the divorce case, the plaintiff and defendant have agreed to negotiate a divorce, but some of the conditions agreed upon by both parties have not yet been fulfilled, so Liu has not withdrawn the lawsuit. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng of the First Special Court opened a session to continue the trial. Xi Yunqing appeared in court through her representative lawyer, and Liu Zirong surrendered himself, requesting another postponement, so that after all the settlement contracts are formally signed, he will file another petition to dismiss the case. Judge Peng approved the request and ordered a rescheduling of the hearing to the afternoon of February 17.</p>

<p>Lawyer Yang Shaopeng, who usually has a good reputation, was recently suspected of offering bribes. The Procuratorate of the Shanghai District Court sent a document to the First Special District Court requesting the issuance of an arrest warrant. The First Special Court approved the document and issued an arrest warrant, which was issued to the Xinzha Police Station. Detectives arrested Yang at No. 20, Lane 150, Baker Road, on the afternoon before yesterday at 1 p.m. He was escorted to the Criminal Court 8 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate ordered a bailiff to the court to escort him back. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin did not object because the requester for the transfer was a formal court. After a brief interrogation by Judge Liu Yugui, Yang was allowed to be handed over to the personnel from the Shanghai District Court to be taken back for trial.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: The Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau of this city have recently paid close attention to fire prevention and public safety in the city. In addition to the instruction No. 16485 issued by the Municipal Government before the New Year, it is now learned that Cai Jingjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, also issued instruction No. 215 of the Political Affairs Department at the end of last month, ordering all subordinate branches to pay attention to fire prevention and to promote the newly invented Zhengda fire extinguishing powder. The original text reads: "In accordance with instruction No. 16485 of the Municipal Government, and also based on the factory's report that it will publicly test the fire extinguisher at the Ximen Public Sports Field on January 17 and requested that personnel be sent to attend and monitor, etc., personnel were sent to attend. According to the report (omitted), the powder is pink and its composition is mostly carbon dioxide. It is very effective in extinguishing gasoline and kerosene, but it is not easy to concentrate the powder on the target, which is a disadvantage, etc. After investigation, the fire extinguisher has been proven to be quite effective and will be beneficial to the general public in terms of fire prevention equipment. Therefore, it should be promoted. In addition to reporting the monitoring situation of the test to the Municipal Government and issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered that you follow these instructions and promote it to your subordinates. This order is from Director Cai Jingjun." In addition, Huang Jinrong, a famous person in Shanghai, took the opportunity of a spring banquet yesterday to test the powder in the garden of his private residence in Caohejing, using firewood, kerosene, etc. as fuel. More than 100 people attended and witnessed its great effectiveness. It can extinguish flames of more than 10 feet in diameter within one minute.</p>

<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Industrial Bureau of the Public Concession yesterday, which read: "To whom it may concern: According to a letter from the 35th District Branch of this Federation, member Jiang Xinmin reported that his mother, Jiang Fan, 53 years old, residing at No. 222, Guangxi Road, north of Fuzhou Road, was returning home from shopping at the Zhejiang Road vegetable market at 9:20 a.m. on January 10. While walking past the door of the Fuchang Shoe Store at No. 190, Guangxi Road, a vehicle No. 16251 of the Industrial Bureau suddenly sped up from behind without honking the horn, causing Fan to be unable to avoid it and being knocked down by the vehicle, breaking her left ankle. She fainted on the spot. The driver did not care at all and sped away. After careful investigation at the scene of the accident, it was learned that the vehicle was traveling from south to north. According to traffic regulations, it should have been traveling on the left side. The location where Fan was hit was at the door of the Fuchang Shoe Store at No. 190, east of the road, indicating that the vehicle did not comply with traffic regulations and did not honk the horn in a narrow street, driving at high speed, resulting in an accident, which is a violation of the criminal law of negligence of duty. We request that you uphold justice and request that the Federation negotiate on our behalf. We have learned that your Bureau has strict regulations for vehicles operating within the Concession. Now, the driver of the official vehicle has violated the regulations, disregarding human life and treating it as a trifle, which is very wrong. We are writing to request that your Bureau conduct a thorough investigation of the truth as soon as possible, severely punish the driver who caused the accident to serve as a warning to others, and compensate Jiang Fan, the victim, for all losses in order to clarify responsibility.

<h3 id="e128">Bai Yushuang Pail Throwing Case Concludes Bai Withdraws Lawsuit Two Defendants Sentenced for Disorderly Conduct <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Bai Yushuang, a Tianjin native residing at No. 7, Bottom of Beile Road, Samsungfang, in the French Concession, currently performing Beng Beng Opera at the Empire Theatre, was attacked with feces thrown by a rogue young fellow countryman Zhao Yuqing on the afternoon of the 27th of last month at 8 PM as she was leaving Samsungfang to go to the Empire Theatre to perform. The feces covered her head and face, and her gray coat, valued at four hundred yuan, was soaked in fecal matter. She cried out loudly, and her mother, neighbors, and detectives chased Zhao to Xujiahui Road, where he was apprehended. His accomplice, Zhang Furui (35 years old, Tianjin native, carpet weaver, residing at No. 15, Xingshunli, Dapu Road, Chinese Territory), Zhao's cousin, was also apprehended and handed over to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Bai appointed Wu Zhengxu as her lawyer to file a private lawsuit, seeking compensation for the loss of the coat. This has been reported previously. It is now known that the private lawsuit part of the case has been mediated, and Bai agreed to drop it. The public lawsuit part is still being prosecuted by the police according to law. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing. Bai, as the plaintiff and witness, was required to appear in court. At around 9 AM, she arrived at the court with her lawyer, Wu Zhengxu, and waited on the gallery of the eighth criminal court. Because Bai's artistry is famous throughout Shanghai, male and female court staff rushed to the eighth court to admire Bai's demeanor, causing the court to be crowded with people and almost impossible to move. Bai seemed shy and tucked her face into the fur collar of her brand new gray coat. Judge Sun Pengxian ascended the bench at this time. After hearing several theft cases, he heard this case at 10:30 AM. Bailiffs brought the two defendants, Zhao and Zhang, to the dock. Bai was also summoned to the court. After questioning the defendants about their age and origin, Yuan Jiahan, a lawyer from the police department, stated the facts of the case and prosecuted the defendants Zhao and Zhang for damaging property under Article 354 of the Criminal Law and for violating the police regulations under Article 50, paragraph 1. The judge then questioned the plaintiff Bai Yushuang, who stated that her original name was Li Guiqin, 24 years old, from Tianjin. He asked, "Did these two defendants throw feces on your body?" Bai nodded and replied, "Yes." He asked, "Do you still want to sue them now?" Bai replied, "I don't know them, and I don't have any grudges. What would I sue them for?" He asked, "So you're not suing them, is that right?" She replied, "Yes." The judge turned to Zhao and asked, "Who told you to throw the feces?" The second defendant, Zhang Furui, said, "It was Xu Kaiyuan, who is on the run." The judge asked Zhao whether he was instructed by Zhang Furui. Zhao replied, "Zhang invited me to Xu Kaiyuan's house. I don't know anything else." The judge asked Zhang Furui, "Did you tell the police that the Hebei Native Place Association asked Bai Yushuang to perform, but she refused, so you went to throw feces?" He replied, "I don't know." At this point, the judge asked the police lawyer for his opinion on the case. Lawyer Yuan immediately said, "Article 354 of the Criminal Law is a crime that requires a complaint, and it can be withdrawn according to law. Since the plaintiff is unwilling to pursue the matter, the police department does not object. However, for the violation of police regulations, please make a judgment according to law." The judge then announced the conclusion of the trial and sentenced Zhao Yuqing to ten days of detention for defiling a person's body and Zhang Furui to fifteen days of detention for instigating the defilement of a person's body. The damage to property charge was dismissed. The two defendants immediately declared that they accepted the judgment and were taken away by the bailiffs to be sent to the detention center for execution. Bai Yushuang also withdrew, ordering the servant who came with her to wrap the soiled coat that she brought as evidence and leave the court, and return home by car. The sensational fecal throwing case in Shanghai was thus declared over.</p>

<p>A group of students who studied in Germany and graduates of Tongji University have raised 100,000 yuan to develop the manufacture of small, practical items. They built a factory on the Sports Association Road in Jiangwan and purchased the latest automatic machinery from Germany. After years of preparation, the factory officially opened yesterday and invited guests from all walks of life to visit. More than 200 guests arrived. Manager Zheng led them to visit the stamping, casting, and assembly departments. Engineer Jia demonstrated the functions of each machine. Engineer Jia is over 70 years old and has extensive experience in stamping and copper smelting. In his youth, he was sent by Li Hongzhang to study at Krupp and other factories in Germany for many years. After the tour, the factory served refreshments. Manager Deng showed the company's self-made Shuangyue insurance door lock. The lock combines the features of both ordinary iron key locks and Yale deadlock, making it suitable for a variety of uses. Although American companies such as Schlage and Yale had previously created various models based on this method, many domestic factories have also imitated them, but they have not been popularized due to their complexity and difficulty in manufacturing. Now, this dual-purpose insurance door lock is the result of two years of effort by the factory's consultant, Mr. Jiang, and Manager Zheng. It is sturdy, durable, safe, convenient, and has simple parts, which reduces costs and allows Chinese people to obtain high-quality products for a small amount of money. The factory is currently producing 100 locks per day, which are exclusively managed by Fengyuan Company at No. 356 Beijing Road in the city. Soon, a large number of trial locks will be sold, costing only 3 yuan each.</p>

<p>Tang Chunfang, a Ningbo native, has been struggling to make ends meet due to recent unemployment. At 5:40 PM the day before yesterday, he colluded with two fugitives to go to the Tong Gentang tobacco and grocery store at No. 99 Jiaxing Road. Under the pretense of buying socks and wrapping paper, they deliberately harassed the store, and his accomplices took the opportunity to snatch ten aviation tickets and flee. As a result, he was caught by Huatamu Wang Guangqi. Only 12 copper coins were found on his person. He was taken to the Hongkou police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the third criminal court of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Concession Bureau, stated the facts of the case. The shop assistant Tong Gentang and the detective Wang reported the incident. The defendant insisted that he did not know the two people who snatched the tickets and had nothing to do with the case. He asked for judgment. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be detained and the case to be investigated and judged later.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Man Commits Suicide by Poisoning in Hongkou New Hotel <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>At around 9 PM on the 3rd of this month, a middle-aged man with a bald head wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants went to the Hongkou New Hotel at No. 11 Xī'ān Road and rented room number 23. He wrote his name as Liang Dade, 40 years old, local, in the registration book. He immediately closed the door and went to bed. Unexpectedly, for some unknown reason, he secretly ingested opium and committed suicide in the room. The next day at 1 PM, the tea waiter Lu Zhigen saw that the guest had not gotten up yet and went to call him. However, he knocked on the door repeatedly without a response. Realizing that something was wrong, he managed to open the door and found the man moaning in bed, his face pale. He immediately reported to the Hongkou police station, which summoned an ambulance to rush him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, but to no avail. He soon died. Detective Zhang Shoushan went to investigate and found an empty opium box and a little sugar water in a teapot where the deceased was lying. There were no suicide notes or other items. Therefore, the reason for his suicide and whether he had any family members were difficult to determine at the time. The body was taken to the Fielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Inspector Song Genshan was dispatched to the morgue by the First Special Court. He determined that the corpse had died from poisoning due to opium ingestion during his lifetime. Since no family members were found, it was decided to hand over the body to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

He also testified that on the 24th of June last year, the appellant was unable to work at the law firm due to illness, and the clerk accepted a case of Gao's return of debt. The clerk sent a letter to urge him to pay the debt and Qu Chenglong had a receipt for the return. On the day of the trial (i.e., the 25th), at 3 PM, he went to the detention center of the Second Special Court to meet Zhang Maohu, who was being held. He called Zhang's wife and Zhang's friend Chen Jinghuan to Shen Lanshan's house in Weixiangli, Fada Road, to negotiate.

In an instant, thick smoke filled the air, and the flames spread to the houses, breaking through the roof and becoming uncontrollable. The two families of Wu and others were awakened from their sleep and rushed out, unable to rescue all their clothes and belongings. The Tangqiao police station informed various fire brigades to rush to the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour of burning, all three tile-roofed houses were destroyed, causing losses of more than a thousand taels of gold. After the fire was extinguished, the police station ordered the fire victim Wu Genbao to be taken to the station for questioning about the cause of the fire. According to his statement, the ash that was poured out of the stove, because the embers were not extinguished, the sparks were blown onto the dry straw, causing the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e157">The Cigarette Industry in Shanghai (Continued) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview, No. 12)</p>
<p>2. The Status and Actual Situation of the Cigarette Industry in Shanghai</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the cigarette industry in Shanghai occupies an important position in the national industry. However, it is difficult to know the exact percentage it accounts for, as there is currently a lack of national statistics for the industry. For now, let's make a comparison between Shanghai and the four provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Hebei, and Shandong to get a glimpse. According to the China Yearbook of 1925, there were a total of 53 cigarette factories in the aforementioned five regions. Shanghai accounted for 44 factories, while the other four regions accounted for only 9 factories. At the same time, the capital of the former totaled 18,992,000 yuan, while the latter totaled only 390,000 yuan. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that without Shanghai, there would be no cigarette industry in China. Now, the names, addresses, etc. of the main cigarette factories in this area (those with capital of more than 100,000 yuan) are listed as follows:</p>
<p>List of Major Chinese-Owned Cigarette Factories in Shanghai</p>
<p>Factory Name Factory Address Year Established Capital (Thousands of Units)</p>
<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company is an important stronghold of the national cigarette industry, and Huacheng is a rising star in the industry, both occupying very important positions. In addition to the manufacturing plants listed in the previous table, Nanyang also has many general and branch offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Hankou, and other ports, with a very large scale. The company was originally unlimited in nature, but was changed to a limited liability company in 1918. Currently, Chen Bingqian is the chairman and Jian Yujie is the general manager. The company has many brands, with White Gold Dragon, Great Wall, and Great Linked Pearls being the most famous. The Huacheng Tobacco Company has a distribution office in Zhongzha Lane, Ningbo Road. It was changed to a joint-stock limited liability company in 1923. The current general manager is Dai Gengxin from Zhenhai. The company has two new manufacturing plants, covering an area of ​​12 mu, with perfect machinery and equipment. Its products are most popular with the Beautiful Golden Mouse brand.</p>
<p>In August of last year, the Huafie Tobacco Company was established with a capital of 500,000 yuan, almost entirely supplied by the Philipine Aromatic Cigarette Manufacture Co. The director and general manager is Lin Zhaopin, who has considerable experience in the cigarette industry. The factory and general office are located on Baoding Road, and the distribution office is located on Niuzhuang Road. The houses are all rented, with a monthly rent of more than 700 yuan. The factory has three cigarette-making machines, two tobacco-cutting machines, one baling machine, and other assets totaling about 200,000 yuan. The products include Hero, White House, and Yellow Girl brands. It is said that the factory's cigarette-making machine can produce 1,200 cigarettes per minute and 800 cigars.</p>
<p>When studying the cigarette industry in China or Shanghai, the most important thing we cannot ignore is the superior position of the British American Tobacco Company. The company was originally named the American-owned Mao Sheng Foreign Company. Later, because the American merchants did not intend to operate it, it was transferred to the Xielong Foreign Company, and then transferred to the Fengyu Foreign Company. In 1903, Fengyu sold it to the London British American Tobacco Company, becoming the company's general company in China. The general office of the British American Tobacco Company in Shanghai is located at 6 Suzhou Road, with branches in important towns throughout the interior. There are its manufacturing plants at Lujiazui and Lujiadu in Pudong, and 67 Jiao, Taopeng Road. Its capital is strong and its equipment is complete, above Nanyang and Huacheng. At the same time, the tobacco leaf market in the area around Lu, Wan, and Yu is entirely controlled by the company. And since November 1, 1934, it has changed its brand name to Yizhong Transport and Sales Tobacco Company to avoid attention and reduce prices for dumping, with a very profound intention.

<p>Today's Continued Meeting to Discuss National Crisis Education, etc.</p>
<p>And Invite Guo Yunguan, Zhang Yaozeng, etc. to Give Lectures</p>
<p>The Chinese Legal Education Association was initiated and organized by eighteen colleges and departments across the country based on the resolution of the National Judicial Conference last year. After a long period of preparation, the inaugural meeting and the first annual meeting were held at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge in this city yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The inaugural ceremony was held in the morning, the association's charter was discussed in the afternoon, and a banquet was held in the evening for Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, etc. The meeting will continue this morning to discuss important proposals such as national crisis education, and to discuss the date and location of the second annual meeting, and to determine the school in charge for the year.

<p>Origin of the Initiative: In May of last year, the Judicial Yuan of the National Government convened the National Judicial Conference in Nanjing. All universities and independent colleges in the country with law departments sent representatives to attend. The attendees included representatives from the Central Political School, Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Peking University, Peiping University, Guangzhou University, Guangdong National University, Wuhan University, Yenching University, Xiamen University, Great China University, Fudan University, Aurora University, Chaoyang College, Soochow Law School, Shanghai Law School, College of Law and Politics, and Chih Tze College, a total of eighteen schools. Feeling the necessity of an organized group for law departments in the country, they agreed to decide on a simple five-article charter for the Chinese Legal Education Association and decided to convene the first annual meeting in Shanghai during the winter vacation of this semester. Shandong Law School, Fudan University, and Shanghai Law School were entrusted to prepare and notify the other schools. This is the origin of the organization of the association.</p>

The gains and losses of legal education are greatly related to the prosperity and decline of the country and the protection of the people. The establishment of this association is extremely necessary and naturally appropriate. The representatives of various schools attending today are mostly legal experts. After the establishment of this association, it will definitely contribute to the improvement of legal education and greatly benefit the future of the rule of law in the country, and so on. Shen Junru then gave a report.</p>

<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiaocang, Original by Louisa M. Alcott</p>
<p>"Yes; she is so happy, she saw that you didn't know what to do," Mr. Bhaer began, but he couldn't continue because the children here had all surrounded Don, making a lot of noise to show their joy and asking him many questions; but he didn't answer a few when suddenly a voice shouted:</p>
<p>"Three cheers for Don"! Looking up, they saw Mrs. Jo already waving a dishcloth at the door, looking as if she was about to do a whirlwind dance, like Miss Jo used to do.</p>
<p>"Then let's go," shouted Mr. Bhaer, and then he led the cheers, and the joy thundered, shocking Assy in the kitchen. Old Mr. Laurence happened to be driving past the door and heard it and shook his head, saying:</p>
<p>"The schools that are gathered are really different from when we were kids"!</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer found it difficult to calm his group of excited little lambs for a while. Since they couldn't do their homework at this time, he told them a Greek story. The outline of the story was like this:</p>

<h3 id="e182">Industrial Safety <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>With the changing of the year, may you have a smooth passage. In industry and commerce, when we meet, we often extend "Congratulations" and "Good luck" to each other. This is a custom in the business world and is understandable. In my opinion, what the industrial and commercial sectors can congratulate themselves on most is industrial safety; what they can consider most fortunate is also industrial safety. If a factory can operate without disasters and difficulties and pass safely, this is the most congratulatory and fortunate thing. This should be prepared for in peacetime, not just paid attention to on one day. What is prepared? Is the factory building suitable? In case of an emergency, can it be isolated to prevent it from spreading? Is the arrangement of the machines symmetrical? Does the actual work hinder the process? Can dangerous items be avoided? Is the fire protection equipment complete? Is the usual practice skilled? Especially the inspection of steam boilers, the inspection of electrical wires, and places that are easy to catch fire. The goods and items involved should be strictly examined with scientific methods. The ancients said that it is better to move the chimney and remove the firewood than to be burned head and face. Therefore, congratulations and good luck do not need to be shouted, but industrial safety cannot be ignored. The Industrial Health Exhibition organized by the Ministry of Industry and the Central Industrial Inspection Office is set up for this purpose. The leaders of domestic goods factories in Shanghai visited together and gained a lot. Cheng Shoushen of the Shanghai Machinery Association expressed his feelings after the visit: He believed that the safety items listed in the meeting were indispensable equipment for all factories and had great assistance in improving the domestic goods industry. It can be seen that it is valued by the domestic goods industry. I sincerely hope that the leaders of domestic goods factories across the country will unanimously advocate and agree with it, so that this year's trade surplus can be even more amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Impression of Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Enthusiastic about National Products <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Words that are so wonderful that he advises everyone not to buy things</p>
<p>Mr. Xiaolai has been in Shanghai for 30 years and has spared no effort in serving the community! And with the sound of a large bell, his spirit is a hundred times better? It is especially admirable that he is simple and unadorned, with a spring breeze on his face, so the impression of Mr. is very deep!</p>
<p>I remember that on the opening day of the National Products Exhibition at Penglai Market, Mr. shouted loudly to the crowd! To remind everyone to remember national products and love national products, but the words "Don't buy things" are humorous and contain the amazing words of truth. At that time, the audience was unaware of what was happening. After Mr. explained that "Don't buy Dong× goods, and don't buy Xi× goods," everyone suddenly understood! Usually, "things" are a pronoun for commodities, no wonder the public misunderstood. How can we cut off supplies? I don’t know that Mr.'s speech talent and agile thinking are enough to make people happy. It can also be seen that Mr. is enthusiastic about promoting national products. I don’t have time to visit again, so I’m writing about my previous impressions of Mr. for the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Nanjing Central Market Tour <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Li Anfu</p>
<p>In this capital, where various enterprises are advancing rapidly, there aren't absolutely no group-style domestic goods markets. The more basic ones include the Xinshi Market at Fuzimiao, while the better ones include the Da Zhonghua Market and the Guohuo Company, etc. However, their inappropriate internal arrangements or lack of goods are clearly insufficient for a metropolis with a population of over a million. Thus, the Nanjing Central Market was born out of the needs of the citizens!</p>
<p>The Central Market is open! Whether to buy things or just to watch the excitement, everyone wants to see this leading market in the capital. So, I also joined the crowd and squeezed in. As soon as I walked onto Zhongzheng Road, the steel-and-concrete archway of the Central Market, resembling a "war victory arch," came into view, especially its towering roof. Walking through the archway, about thirty or forty steps away, is the facade of the Central Market. The grandeur of its architecture and the vastness of its area, in terms of Shanghai, are not inferior to the Continental Market. Moreover, because the roof of the main aisle is made of glass, the quality of light is far beyond what the Continental Market can achieve. At the same time, because No. 1 is the Central Garden, two model gardens were specially built on both sides of the facade, making the facade even more elegant!</p>
<p>Walking through the entrance, you can see shops on both sides. In the middle of the wide corridor, there are also many glass display cases. Some people say this style is like the Dong'an Market in Beiping, but how could the Dong'an Market have such good construction and lighting! Walking through the long corridor and turning to the left, there is another similar long corridor. To put it simply, the design is like a long, narrow 口 (kou) shape with a large 十 (shi) shape in the middle. The downstairs area has the most practical shops, while the upstairs area has restaurants, teahouses, etc. There are a total of 167 shops and stalls, selling products from Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other places. It can be said that they are entirely domestic goods. It seems that there is no such large group market in Shanghai, let alone in the capital. At the same time, what is even more satisfying is that there is a management office and regulations, so that all shops can comply with them, such as marking prices, stipulating low-price periods, etc., creating a domestic goods market performing with a new attitude. Moreover, in their plans, there are also amusement parks and cinemas. Undoubtedly, the future of this Central Market will definitely have greater development.</p>
<p>After touring for a week, the reporter feels that we often only shout and do not act in any undertaking. For example, even elementary school students can smoothly chant the slogan of promoting domestic goods, but what has been achieved in that domestic goods year? On various statistical tables of imported goods, the numbers are increasing day by day, while our country, shouting the slogan of promoting domestic goods, is getting poorer day by day. We might as well ask ourselves, what is the reason for this? Isn't it just the effect of knowing only how to shout but not how to do? Therefore, the lesson given to me after seeing the Central Market is that we need a spirit of action.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Hopes for Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Qiu</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times is advancing day by day, and the calendar on the wall is being torn off page by page. In the blink of an eye, this thick calendar has been torn off! Thus, this twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China—the Students' Domestic Goods Year—has also ended! Of course, in this Students' Domestic Goods Year, there have been a few things that are barely satisfactory, but the promotion of domestic goods has not yet succeeded, which is undeniable. Therefore, there is still a need to continue to work hard to promote domestic goods. However, the Student Domestic Goods Year of the 24th year has ended! What year is the 25th year? After several meetings, various groups in Shanghai have designated this year—the 25th year of the Republic of China—as the Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year. According to the word "Citizens," it clearly refers to Shanghai. Therefore, the banner for promoting domestic goods this year is: Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year. We very much agree with this kind of banner. Because Shanghai is the only big city in our country, and Shanghai consumes the most foreign goods. Moreover, Shanghai is also the location of our country's commercial center. Therefore, there are several meanings to using the banner of Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year: First: Since Shanghai is the only big city in our country, Shanghai has the responsibility to lead the whole country; Second: Since Shanghai is the place with the most foreign imports and is also a general transit point for foreign goods, if Shanghai implements the promotion of domestic goods and the use of domestic goods, foreign goods will naturally not come in endlessly! Third: Since Shanghai is the location of the national industrial and commercial center, it is especially appropriate to start with industrial and commercial reforms based on the principle of promoting domestic goods. Therefore, I think the stipulation of Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year is very appropriate. However, as this Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year has just begun, there are a few points that I hope all compatriots across the country will pay attention to:</p>
<p>First: Although this year is Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year, all Chinese people have the obligation to use domestic goods. Do not think that pushing the responsibility onto the people of Shanghai is enough. You must know that the purpose of this year's banner is for the people of Shanghai to lead our national people in using domestic goods. This point must be clearly recognized.</p>
<p>Second: At the beginning of this Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year, everyone can reflect on their own situation in promoting domestic goods last year. If you were able to work hard to implement it, you should work even harder; if you were not able to implement it, you should quickly correct your mistakes.</p>
<p>Third: I hope that all industries and businesses across the country will work hard to improve their products so that every product can meet the needs of the Chinese people, and that the price can be reduced as much as possible within a possible range to achieve cooperation between production, sales, and customers.</p>
<p>Fourth: I hope that all Chinese people will completely use domestic goods from this year onwards.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish the Shanghai Citizens' Use of Domestic Goods Year success!</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm stated that the New York stock market rose slightly yesterday (the 4th), with railway, brewing, rubber, and special stocks rising significantly. Railway stocks rose to a new peak since 1934, probably due to the good freight traffic this week, which must be unprecedented this year. The Dow Jones industrial stock index rose to a new peak since 1931, due to the improving prospects for the steel industry and the rise in steel stocks. Auto stocks fell due to General Motors not issuing dividends. Electric stocks rose, so the two offset each other. Public stocks were slightly lower due to profit-taking on floating shares. Small exchange stocks were active and rose slightly. The bond market was very strong. The total daily turnover was 3.01 million shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Yarn and Cotton: Negative News on American Cotton; Cotton Yarn Market Conditions Change; Many Floating Shares Released... Bearish Short Positions Added <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market weakened and the downward trend resumed, largely due to negative news on American cotton that favored short positions. Osaka's Sanpin yarn was also sluggish, leading to market weariness. At the same time, spot yarn sales were not as strong as the previous day, and many floating shares were released, making the market increasingly slack. In short, inventories have increased, so bearish parties are active, but the banking sector remains unmoved.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Staple Yarn Falls by Over One Yuan <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The staple yarn market opened in the previous session with negative news on American cotton and a change in market conditions. Buyers were scarce, and all months declined uniformly, making the situation quite weak. Run Kang's short positions were heavily dumped and added. Osaka's Sanpin yarn was mediocre, and market prices deteriorated step by step. As a result, each month fell by 9 jiao to 1.3, 4, 6, and 8 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was sluggish, and it was heard that spot yarn transactions were rare, and market sentiment was even more lax. By the time of closing, the spread of short positions was slightly compensated and rebounded. As a result, each month still fell by 1 or 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yu Da sold 1,500 bales, Da Pei 1,500 bales, Yuan Yi 550 bales, Run Kang 1,650 bales, Tong He 650 bales, Heng De 1,300 bales, Da Chang 700 bales, and Yong Da 300 bales. Da Fu bought 1,350 bales, Da Feng 400 bales, Sen Kang 450 bales, Shen Ji 1,350 bales, Shun Da 650 bales, Chang Feng 1,450 bales, Chang Yu 450 bales, and Xin Cheng 700 bales.

<p>Spot yarn sales were slightly clearer. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 696 bales throughout the day. The market price fell by 5 jiao. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Chips Loosen; Forward Cotton Sees Further Decline <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market fell back and the downward trend intensified, truly due to political news on American cotton that favored short positions. The Senate delayed the agricultural cotton legislation, and the future still needs to be seen as falling. The standard gold market also presented a hovering image, so market sentiment was even weaker, and the selling wind was very strong again, and the market price fell.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Standard Cotton Falls by Six or Seven Jiao <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the previous session, and each month showed a sharp decline, probably because the news on American cotton was not good, and President Luo had a cancellation statement on the Peng Haide case. The market price looked down. Today, the telex showed a drop of 4 to 15 pounds. Indian cotton fell 0.5 to 1 rupee. Osaka's Sanpin cotton fell 3 or 4 jiao. Market sentiment was frightened, and the selling atmosphere suddenly became dense, and the market price fell step by step. As a result, each month fell by 2.5 to 5.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The remote month situation was even more frustrated at the afternoon opening. Foreign firms slightly sold, and the chips turned loose. As a result, the recent months fell by 1 to 2 jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Run Kang sold 6,800 dan, He Xing 1,300 dan, Da Chang Cheng 2,400 dan, and Sheng Yuan 1,000 dan. Ji Feng bought 1,400 dan, Shen Ji 1,600 dan, Gu Da 1,000 dan, Chang Feng 1,400 dan, Yuan Da 1,100 dan, Zhen Da 1,000 dan, Geng Feng 1,600 dan, Yi Kang 2,600 dan, and Chang He 1,000 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Weight of Cotton Bales Packaging <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The packaging of cotton in our country has never had a uniform standard, and the decoration varies from place to place. American cotton each bale is 500 pounds, and rolled cotton is 300 pounds. This type of packaging is called the Mei An Yangxing modification method. Indian cotton is 300 pounds per bale, with no difference. The situation of district differences in our country is now recorded. Shaanxi Hua Lingbao Hua generally hits foreign shelves, each piece 500 pounds, totaling 375 Sima scales. There are also large and medium buns. This type of packaging is mostly popular in Shandong, Henan, and other places. Foreign shelves are decorated. The previous weight was 330 jin per bale, and the wooden shelves were earth bundles in the countryside, packed by manpower, with different weights. They are also bundled with hemp rope and lead wire, ranging from 150 jin to 260 jin. The so-called white bag flowers are all made of white cloth running through the bag. Tongzhou flower fire machine flower original flower Taicang flower Wusong flower, etc., stipulate 125 jin per bale, Taicang flower has grass bags, Yao flower is Ningbo flower, 60 jin per bale, and also uses cloth bags. The above jin are all calculated in Sima scales.</p>
<h3 id="e198">US Government Begins Selling Spot Cotton <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The American cotton market opened yesterday, and the Liverpool telecommunications were not good, with each month falling by 2 to 9 pounds. The Smith plan will sell the government's stockpiled cotton, selling 75,000 bales of spot cotton. The public intends to be favorable to the seller, and they have concluded their positions one after another. At the same time, Liverpool and New Orleans are selling Chen cotton, and some are cutting their positions with heartache. Afterwards, traders bought at a limited price, and there was a slight rebound. The recent months ended up with bulls concluding again, and softening again. Finally, due to short households making up for the losses and traders buying, they were still firm. Spot goods fell 15 pounds, and futures fell 3 to 15 pounds. British spot cotton was unchanged, futures fell 5 to 8 points. Indian cotton futures merchants bought slightly in the early morning. Speculators bought July futures, and then retail investors liquidated. Operators sold, and European exporters bought slightly. Ping Guoer rose half a rupee, Aomula fell half a rupee, and Bai Luoxi fell one rupee. The original telex is recorded on the left (telex on the 4th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telex, the opening forecast for Luoxi flower on the 5th is 193.5 rupees, down 1.75 rupees from the previous closing price.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, the market for each month was consistently soft. With the quotation of foreign wheat, only 48 points of ups and downs in Chicago and Canada, the market sentiment, due to the peaceful gold market, each near and far term, fell by 1 or 2 fen, etc., until the afternoon opening, it was still flat and weak at first, and then due to inland customers, and each inland factory, rising and covering short positions, so the near and far lines could only determine the path of ups and downs, etc.</p>

<p>Yesterday's date wheat market, after the morning opening, the market for each month was consistently weak and soft, with the flour market sluggish, and the bulls were very lax. The opening price for February and March fell by 3 or 5 fen from the previous day, and the new wheat in June and July also fell by 2 or 3 fen. Until the afternoon opening, this month rose by 3 fen due to the short covering, and the remote period also rose by 3 or 4 fen due to the high flour market. The after-step may be due to the spring rain, or it may need to be brought high, etc. The spot wheat market, the price is still stable, and the transaction is smoother. The opening of Dongyaowan, Luohe, Nansuzhou wheat is 5 yuan 2 jiao 4 or 5 fen, and Hankou wheat is 4 yuan 8 jiao half, second 8 jiao 3 fen, totaling 3,700 bales, which were handled by Shenda, Fuxin, and Fufeng, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Unpolished Rice Arrival, Mostly Thin Rice <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various merchants were slightly more than before, with a total of about forty dealers (with more than 8,000 shih of goods). Among them, thin rice was the most abundant. Due to Tianjin merchants suspending operations due to the river being sealed, only Qingdao merchants handled 1,200 to 1,300 packages, so the market price was difficult to maintain, with high-grade material slightly decreasing by two or three cents, and medium-grade material dropping by one dime. Thick japonica rice sales were balanced. Early rice from Nan Gang increased by five cents. Japonica rice handled between dealers remained relatively stable. Du Jian's supply and demand were similar, and Yin Bian Yuan was also the same. (North of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various routes downstream were less, with only over ten boats. On the market, various goods were in demand. White japonica rice continued to sell. Early rice was ordinary. Thin rice was slightly purchased in small quantities. Tianjin goods continued to move. White Yuan had quite active retail sales. Sheep Tip transactions were ordinary. The routes for guest merchants turned active. Market prices for white japonica rice were slightly tighter by a few cents depending on high, medium, and low grades. Early thin rice was stable. White Yuan was tightly discounted by one dime. Sheep Tip was stable. Guest Tip was strong, and the price of other goods showed a slightly tightening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Red Unpolished Rice Inquiries from North and South <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for guest indica rice were dull in both arrival and sales. Only about 2,000 packages of newly arrived Jiujiang rice were at the end. A small amount of rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Hangzhou, and Ningbo also arrived in Shanghai. However, sales were sparse due to rain and few visiting merchants. Only the local street had a little decoration of over 2,000 packages. Only merchants from Nanyang and Tianjin were still inquiring about red and unpolished rice. The stock of red sugar was low, so the market was relatively strong. Other aspects remained fair and stable. A total of 2,000 packages of Jiangxi rice, 200 packages of Hubei rice, and 450 packages of rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Hangzhou, and Ningbo were offered throughout the day. Market prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Sugar Market, Premium White Sugar Opened at Over 500 Packages Yesterday <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a stabilization of customs gold, settling at 2.267, so the trend softened. The association's bid for No. 24 coarse white sugar was 22.7 yuan, which was not achieved. Re-exported goods were offered at a slightly lower dime, at 6.6 yuan. Spot prices for Dong Chi remained unchanged. Spot prices for No. 8 Dong White were offered at 22.2 yuan, and re-exported goods with the TK mark were 7.2 yuan, both down by a nickel. No. 9 YRO mark was offered at the original price, which was not achieved. Mian Bai from the local factory, Zhen Ji No. 1, was 21 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were returned according to the license plate. There was a Chaozhou merchant offering new Zhi Yang at 200-plus packages, which was higher than Gao Zhuang at 14.2 yuan, and ordinary Zhi Yang at 12.6 to 12.8 yuan, and over 100 packages of ordinary red Zhi Yang at 11.2 yuan, down by three or four dimes. Xinghua merchants offered large Gong Fen broken sugar, the same as Ding Zhuang at 20 yuan, and the second grade at 19.5 to 19.4 yuan, for a total of over 500 packages traded. Another over 100 packages of Xinghua red sugar were traded at 12.65 yuan, down by half a dime. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company again reached the bidding period yesterday. Due to the loosening of customs gold, the bid price did not change, so the transaction volume decreased. A total of 1,000 packages of Five Sheep Group white sugar were bidded at 22.7 yuan, with 20 packages traded. 1,660 packages of No. 2 Five Sheep Mian Bai were bidded at 21.45 yuan, with 250 packages traded. 917 packages of No. 4 were bidded at 21.25 yuan, with 50 packages traded.</p>

<p>The Western suits and woolens in ready-made suits officially opened yesterday, and the prices rose sharply by 20% compared to before, resulting in a standstill in wholesale business. Western clothing merchants all disliked it, and retail stores insisted that the actual price increase had to be 20%. No. 42,000 Western suit flannel, which used to cost 4.3 to 4.4 yuan, is now uniformly priced at 5.5 yuan. No. 18,000 "something-or-other", which used to cost about 5 yuan, is now uniformly sold at 6 yuan. Buyers and sellers rejected each other, so formal transactions were quite clear. However, there were many transactions with number houses that secretly raised prices by five or six percent. Larger retail stores such as Yichangtai, Lianxing, Fuchang, Yuchangshen, and Shengda all refused to compromise, because according to the current customs gold exchange rate, the cost of new goods per yard would also have to rise sharply by about 20%.</p>
<h3 id="e207">North-South Goods, Xu Kuizi Seed Price Increased by About Two Yuan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>According to news from Xuzhou yesterday regarding black melon seeds, merchants from Nanjing and Xi'an were purchasing in the local area, causing the production price to suddenly increase by about two yuan. High-grade goods for shipment to Shanghai must be above 20 yuan, so the number of goods on the Shanghai market has also become tight and fewer are being released. For example, Congji's Xu Kuizi seeds are also priced at 20 yuan by the South City number houses. According to industry insiders, there is hope for more than 20 yuan in the future. Due to customs duties, it was difficult to agree on prices for large lotus seeds in the past, so the source was scarce for a long time. Recently, taking advantage of the gradually increasing market price, some have been shipped, and the first city meeting was 14 yuan. Yesterday, another 300-plus packages were opened, and the goods were of higher quality, with a price of 15.1 yuan, up by nearly one yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the New York silk price continued to fall sharply (down by a nickel compared to the previous day). The Shanghai silk market's sentiment is also gradually shaking. Since last week, the price of silk in Shanghai has fallen by more than 80 yuan. Looking at the current situation, the price of Shanghai silk B-grade 20.22 is holding at 700 yuan outside customs, and it is unlikely that there will be large-scale transactions for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Nature of Nationalism <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>National self-awareness is the self-recognition of a nation, and it occurs in oppressed nations. Therefore, the nationalism that awakens national self-awareness is a banner to overthrow imperialism. Hence, its nature is political.</p>
<p>This point is one of the keys to understanding nationalism. Therefore, Zhang Fodai's statement in the Guowen Weekly that "we must put nationalism on a moral foundation to make it a healthy ethical principle that everyone can believe in" (Volume 13, Issue 1) is incorrect.</p>
<p>Then, "the goal of nationalism at this time is nothing more than anti-imperialism, using nationalism to fight against imperialism" (ibid.). Yes, this is precisely the fundamental role of nationalism. It has nothing else beyond this.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhang Foquan's view that "nationalism is outward-looking, negative, and destructive" (ibid.) is a fundamentally flawed reason for revising nationalism. He does not truly understand nationalism. In fact, are the occurrence, practice, and function of nationalism not all based on the oppressed nation's passive destruction of external aggressive forces to achieve liberation? What nationalism is there besides this?</p>
<p>This does not mean that it has no impact on economic, moral, educational, artistic, and other aspects of life. Of course, it does. The superiority of political life and the interactivity of various aspects of life inevitably extend nationalism to all aspects. Is not the so-called national economy just another name for a national economy?</p>
<p>Similarly, it also has inward-looking, active, and constructive significance. In this respect, is not the anti-imperialist national economy a clear example?</p>
<p>But this never changes the nature of nationalism. On the contrary, its expansion turns economics, morality, education, art, etc., into means of national political movements. In other words, it seeks to create anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles from all aspects.</p>
<p>Then, the inward-looking, active, and constructive nature it expresses in all aspects is merely the activity of the oppressed nation to passively destroy the aggressive forces from outside. Its purpose is to form a revolutionary force independent of imperialism.</p>
<p>If we feel that the work of forming a national revolutionary force is very important, and therefore promote the inward-looking, active, and constructive nature of nationalism, that is to say, we want to advocate national economy, national morality, national education, national art, etc., we may as well regard the inward-looking, active, and constructive nature of nationalism as parallel to the outward-looking, passive, and destructive nature of nationalism.</p>
<p>Then, we can say that nationalism is outward-looking, passive, and destructive with respect to imperialism; and it is inward-looking, active, and constructive with respect to oppressed nations. It is not simple, it contains contradictions, and it is a kind of opposing unity. So be it.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhang Foquan's view that the inward-looking, active, and constructive nature of nationalism is incompatible with the outward-looking, passive, and destructive nature of nationalism, and his advocacy of using the former to replace the latter, is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Only internal reorganization, not resistance to external insults. Is that not a compromising tendency against overthrowing imperialism?</p>
<p>However, in today's world where imperialist aggression is intensifying, and in today's world where it is extremely necessary to awaken the national self-awareness movement, we must still place special emphasis on the outward-looking, passive, and destructive nature of nationalism. Even when forming a national revolutionary force, that is, when exerting the inward-looking, active, and constructive nature of nationalism, we must also pay attention to this point. Otherwise, it can only create power, not a national revolutionary force, for the purpose of opposing imperialism and achieving national liberation.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot but criticize Zhang Foquan's "new interpretation." Everyone in the cultural circles should stand up today to oppose the consciousness of compromise and oppose national abolitionism. Is this not the effort we should make for the most needed national revolutionary movement at present?</p>
<h3 id="e210">Cultural Activities of Chinese Students in Tokyo <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yin</p>
<p>Under sharp surveillance and oppression, thousands of Chinese students remaining in Tokyo have not shown any indication of the increasingly serious national crisis. This cannot but express our dissatisfaction to the students back home who have been sacrificed. However, over the past year, Chinese students in Tokyo have exhibited a good phenomenon that has never been seen in the history of studying in Japan, which is the activity of cultural undertakings. Now we can divide this topic into two points to illustrate:</p>
<p>A Publishing</p>
<p>"Liudong News": This is a small newspaper run by Mr. Chuan Xiangmo, founded in the first half of last year. It was initially a weekly, but later, due to good sales, it was changed to a thrice-weekly. The content in the first few issues was very weak, only introducing some trivial news about the students studying abroad. Later, it gradually introduced important domestic news, so the degree of need for it among students also gradually increased.</p>
<p>"Zawen": It is a periodic small literary publication. At first, many people participated, but later, due to financial difficulties, it could not be maintained, and everyone said goodbye to it, leaving only Bo Sheng, Meng Ke, Ren Baige and others struggling desperately. Although this publication is small, the shadow it has left in the minds of students at home and abroad is very strong. Its attitude is correct, it is active, it is dragging the heavy era forward with a solid hemp rope, and it stands opposite to the reactionary, passive, decadent, and "Analects" that sells laughter to local society. When the fourth issue was released, it was suddenly searched by the Tokyo police and has now been renamed "Zhiwen". It is said that the fifth issue will be released soon.</p>
<p>"Dongliu": Dongliu is also a publication that focuses on literature and art. Although its achievements are not as good as "Zawen," it can also be regarded as a second-rate magazine. If society can allow it to grow well, its future achievements will be considerable. But it suffered the same misfortune as "Zawen". At that time, the editor-in-chief, Mr. Chen, was also taken to the Metropolitan Police Department. Although he was released a long time ago, "Dongliu" has "flowed eastward like water."</p>
<p>"Shige": At first, one sheet was published per issue, which was a periodic publication specializing in poetry. Later, due to poor sales and extreme financial difficulties, everyone left. Finally, Mr. Wei Jin took full responsibility for the economic and editorial aspects and changed it to a magazine, but it only published one issue before passing away.</p>
<p>"Gekijo Geijutsu": A magazine specializing in the study of drama, organized by drama groups remaining in Tokyo. It was recently founded and the content is quite good, but it cannot be published on time due to financial reasons.</p>
<p>"Liudong Gakuho": Edited by Mr. Chen Guting, the content includes politics, economics, literature and art. Three issues have been published. Thanks to Mr. Chen's efforts, it should continue.</p>
<p>"Shakai Chishiki": A comprehensive magazine, divided into international, women's, and literary sections, with an emphasis on the international section. It specializes in introducing international politics, economics, military affairs, diplomacy, and other news to help domestic readers understand the international situation. "Shakai Chishiki" uses extremely economical means and a correct attitude to enable domestic compatriots to find some outlines and routes in this bizarre international political situation. The women's section is run by more than a dozen female students who feel that there are too few women's publications in China. They have specifically allocated a piece of land in "Shakai Chishiki" to say a few words that should be said for women in China. Their purpose is to: study the way out for Chinese women; introduce Japanese women's lives; introduce international women's news; and introduce the lives of Chinese female students studying in Japan. The literary section is responsible for manuscripts and editing by students studying literature and art here. There are no full-length creations, focusing on short works depicting real life and introducing internationally renowned literature and art. Edited by Mr. Zhou Moqiu, the Shanghai Mass Magazine Company is the general distributor, and printing and distribution are also in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Gakujutsu Kai": A quarterly magazine edited by the Chinese Student Association of Meiji University, edited by Mr. Liu Ji. It was previously suspended due to financial reasons and was only recently published. After it was printed, the Metropolitan Police Department did not allow it to be distributed because there was a blank space inside titled "War and Morality": "Most people in the world hate war. It is immoral to create war against the will of the majority..." Later, following the police's orders, the blank space was deleted before it was allowed to be distributed. The Japanese government must delete this "anti-war" blank space, and we can know their attitude toward peace.</p>
<p>B Drama Graduation</p>
<p>Chinese drama has gained considerable reputation in Tokyo. Everyone only needs to look at the solemn and careful introduction by the famous writer Akita Ujaku in the Asahi Shimbun to know the efforts of Chinese students in drama. There are many drama groups, the main ones being the China Drama Round Table, the China International Drama Association, and the China Student New Drama Association. In terms of performance, the former two are not as good as the latter. The China Student New Drama Association has had several large-scale performances in Tokyo. The "Inspection Commissioner," etc., performed at the Tsukiji Little Theater in November last year, received very good results. Everyone said with certainty that this drama troupe has hope in the future.</p>
<p>In short, Chinese students in Tokyo have absolutely not forgotten the disasters of their motherland. We are always working hard for the motherland, only because the environment is different, the way of working hard is also slightly different, which should be understood by all parties. Teachers here are subjected to inhumane treatment and are under severe surveillance at all times. If it were not for the weakness of the motherland, how could this be? We hope with tears that the motherland can endure hardship and struggle, and hope that the motherland will one day be able to stretch its long-bent waist on the steep and dangerous international terrain!</p>
<h3 id="e211">Bookstore Scenery (Continued) <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>Another situation that greatly affects pricing is the method of doing "business," such as new bookstores trying to expand their sales network and trying to please bookstore owners in the interior. These bookstore owners know nothing about books, only that the agency discount is large and the commission is high. But if they follow their demands, the new bookstores will inevitably lose money, and the books cannot be sold. Therefore, the smart managers of the new bookstores came up with a way to satisfy both sides, that is, to learn from the foreign goods stores on the road, shouting cheap prices in public, but secretly raising the marked price. As a result, the book industry has not developed in recent years, but the pricing of books has become higher day by day.</p>
<p>As a result, a strange phenomenon has occurred, that is, readers who buy books go to the Shanghai headquarters, and the price is often higher than at the retail outlets in other cities. Books sold at the actual price at the Shanghai headquarters can be purchased at a 30% to 20% discount in other cities. Bookstores in Shanghai that sell other people's books often do not purchase directly from a certain large bookstore nearby, but instead purchase indirectly from retail outlets in other cities, and the price is cheaper than purchasing directly from the headquarters. Retailers do not increase handling fees, etc., but the total price is cheaper than the headquarters, is it not strange? But if we know the above reasons, we will not be surprised. The new bookstore headquarters also wants to lower prices to attract customers, but this conflicts with the interests of the interior retailers. If the headquarters sells at the actual price, and the wholesale price to the industry is 30% off, the interior bookstore owners are satisfied, but if the headquarters also sells at 30% off, and does not give the industry 30% off of 30%, then the agents in various places will return the books. Therefore, smart readers often do not buy books from the headquarters, but turn to the retailers.</p>
<p>After 1929, due to the decline of the cultural movement, the general reading atmosphere declined, and the new book industry has been hit. Since the world economic panic occurred, the purchasing power of readers has become even more exhausted. As a result, the unprecedented tragedy of "half price for all new books" has been forced to occur. This is not good news for readers, but a sign of the bankruptcy of the new book industry. Except for one or two large bookstores that are lining up to prevent others from selling off, most of them are losing money and struggling to survive. Don't you see that many new bookstores that had a history in the past are now in a state of stagnation? Their business has declined, and the expenses are the same. If they do not sell off their inventory as much as possible, they may be forced to close. Since the recent currency reform, the price of paper and other costs have obviously increased a lot. But can you still do as before, because the cost has increased, and then "consult with the industry and add one to the marked price"? The complete collapse of the new book industry is probably in the near future.</p>
<p>As for the "20% off" reprints of books without copyright, although it is a deformed phenomenon and not directly related to the scope of the new book industry, it can also reflect what stage the Chinese publishing and cultural circles have reached today. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e212">Writing and Publishing <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Lifu</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun recently published an untitled draft in Haiyan, saying that Mr. Zhu Guangqian regarded "serenity" (Serenity) as the extreme realm of poetry, which inevitably narrowed the scope of poetry and "lingered" the poet. Because anyone who sees the overall picture of the poem, or the poet's entire life, as well as the social state acting on the poet, we will naturally abandon any abstract and general statement, such as "pure and peculiar," "elegant," "leisurely," and so on. In fact, we often encounter methods of generalization like Mr. Zhu's in general literary criticism. Like forcibly adding "progressive," "backward," and so on to a certain writer, it is a very obvious example, but because these are newer than "serenity" and "pure and peculiar," many people do not feel how unpleasant they are. In this regard, I can't help but think of the fact that we also have similar vague understandings in the relationship between writing and publishing, which must be pointed out urgently!</p>
<p>Writing is originally about expressing one's feelings directly, without concealing anything, especially without pretense, but when it comes to publishing, it is another matter. In the publications of the past year or two, writers have been restricted by publishing, and they are not allowed to cover up or be ambiguous, making compromises on the one hand and expressing their own meaning on the other. He even uses second-rate things to replace first-class goods, just like a reputable pharmacy replacing first-class goods with second-class goods. If we read this kind of article and think that the writer's original intention is only this, then we are mistaken. One thing that is very clear is: the introduction of Gide-style thinking was particularly popular last year. Gide's treatises, recent actions, speeches, etc. were published in publications. Comparatively speaking, what can show the true face of this cultural figure is the essay describing himself (Translation, Volume 1, Issue 2), the speech titled In Defense of Culture (Current Events, Volume 3, Issue 17), and Gide's life and works (World Literature, Volume 1, Issue 6). What are the things that have been replaced here?</p>
<p>In the third article, we see several major transformations in Gide's life: first, he was a Protestant ascetic, "sleeping on the woodcut at night, jumping into cold water at dawn, and getting up in the middle of the night to pray"; then he thought that "using 'reason' to subdue 'desire' and using 'morality' to destroy 'nature' is 'cruel and unreasonable'," so the dam collapsed, and "he indulged in sensual pleasures"; then, "reason" and "desire" conflicted again, causing him to fall into depression and begin to examine the true meaning of life, finally reaching this conclusion—"If people can regard all actions that do not originate from consciousness as shame, then people's lives can be changed"; therefore, on the one hand, he cursed the greed of capitalism, and on the other hand, he did not negate personal freedom; he finally believed that "individualism in the true sense should be beneficial to society, and it is a mistake to oppose individualism to collective socialism." These few steps depict the process of a large group of modern intellectuals, especially pointing out the "excitement" "lodged in warmth," as distinct from the "sudden rise" "suppressed by long-term physical labor." In the second article, we encounter the few bright and dazzling lines: "I am French, and at the same time an internationalist. I thoroughly approve of scientific socialism, and at the same time I am also a thorough individualist." He obviously wanted to maintain the greatest characteristics of each individual in the new society, and yet he could justify it theoretically. He continued to seek ways to reconcile society and the individual, but the spirit of individualism in capitalist society was still deeply hidden in his personality. Although the proposition he is now singing, "Only when each individual maintains his greatest characteristics can he serve society," can be in line with dialectical interpretation, we always feel that Gide is a little too clever and too skilled in rhetoric. In the first article, he says how much he likes solitude, and even if he wants to express something, he has to choose a relatively indifferent way. Therefore, "What I have chosen is not language, but articles, not news magazines, but single books, not trendy things, but works of art." This makes us understand even more how Gide sympathizes with hermits who "hide their names in famous mountains." Overall, the Gide obtained from these important documents is a type of transformed literati; it is natural to have no great harm to be close to him, however, in terms of the purpose of writing, simply introducing him can only stimulate the general intellectual class to a considerable extent and achieve some wavering effects, but after all, it is not enough to have an active guidance!

<h3 id="e213">Treatment of Neurasthenia <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Neurasthenia often initially occurs as sexual neurasthenia, such as premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, impotence, etc. Afterward, it gradually progresses to spinal nerve weakness and eventually to cerebral neurasthenia. At this time, symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, multiple dreams, insomnia, weakness of the limbs, general fatigue, and poor memory occur. In severe cases, pain often occurs in the sacrum. In addition to the patient themselves needing to eliminate the predisposing causes, the lifestyle environment is also very important for treating this condition. For example, work and rest must be moderate, regulate eating times, avoid irregular living, correct thoughts, cut off desires, and choose appropriate nutrients to ensure that the body and mind are quiet and free. Drug treatment is best with endocrine and organic phosphorus, as both are tonics for the nervous system. The human body consumes too much of these two elements, so corresponding supplementation is necessary. However, there are many similar drugs, so it is necessary to pay attention to choosing the best to be effective.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Random Notes After Diagnosis <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhang Shouming</p>
<p>The most common disease now, especially among young people, is neurasthenia, often accompanied by nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, etc. The cause of these symptoms is nothing more than excessive sexual activity or masturbation, etc. Patients are often young people who are unaware of the dangers. When the symptoms worsen, they begin to worry and seek medical treatment. When they come to the clinic, I always prescribe "An Er Shen Pian," because this medicine is not ordinary. In addition to containing particularly strong phosphorus, it also contains a large amount of endocrine, so taking it has no side effects or undesirable abuses, and the weakened nerves are easily restored to normal.</p>

<p>— Xu Renjie</p>
<p>I have suffered from nocturnal emission for a long time, and it has not lessened after marriage. I have sought medical treatment and taken medicine, but the effects have been minimal. Over the years, I have become extremely disillusioned with this ailment. Sometimes, I just let it be. A friend of mine, with whom I have a close relationship, knowing my hidden affliction, gave me a good medicine last autumn, saying that this medicine had been tested by many people during the winter and would definitely be effective for my humble disease. I opened it and read, and it was "An Er Shen." I had heard of the medicine for a long time but had never tried it. Because of his sincerity, I took it as directed. During the first three days of taking the medicine, I did not experience a single emission. Afterwards, I continued to purchase three boxes from the Wuzhou Pharmacy and continued to take them. It has been four months since then, and not only has the old ailment been eliminated, but even my weakened spirit has been invigorated. I am grateful to my friend and to the great efficacy of this medicine. I am writing this to inform fellow sufferers.</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Survey of Current Smoking Cessation Methods <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. She Lei</p>
<p>(1) Gradual Reduction Method, also known as the Substitution Method. This method has been used for a long time. In the past, doctors relied on this method to help people quit smoking. Even though there are many methods for quitting smoking now, this method cannot be completely eliminated. The use of this method involves taking opium substitutes, the best of which are new codeine, gradually reducing the dosage to eliminate the smoking habit.</p>
<p>(2) Blistering Method. This method involves applying blistering agents to the flat areas of the chest, abdomen, and legs of the person quitting. After blisters form, the fluid is extracted and injected back into the body of the person quitting. This method was initially popular in Annam and was invented by Mr. "Madina." The reasoning is that, although the details of this type of blister are not yet fully explained, the positive results obtained in practice are sufficient to prove its effectiveness.</p>
<p>(3) Blood Collection Method. This method involves collecting 5 to 10 cc of blood from the veins of the person quitting. It is then either directly injected back or made into a serum and injected into the muscles of the person quitting. At the same time, glucose is injected to replenish the loss. This method is typically applied seven or eight times to completely eliminate the smoking toxins.</p>
<p>(4) Denaturation Method. This method involves the daily intravenous injection of organic calcium compounds. This gradually separates the smoking toxins combined with cells in the body, eventually leading to their complete disappearance.</p>
<p>(5) Lecithin Method. Lecithin is obtained from animal brain matter, egg yolk, and soybeans. The most effective source is egg yolk. According to users, it rarely produces complete results. Therefore, using it alone is of questionable effectiveness. It can be used to supplement other methods, or other methods can be used to supplement it, to achieve better results.</p>
<p>(6) Sleep Method. Administering large doses of sleeping pills to the person quitting to make them fall asleep and not feel any withdrawal pain, thereby eliminating the smoking habit and achieving the goal of quitting.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Four Treatments for Gonorrhea <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>In the past, there was no proper method for treating gonorrhea. With the advancement of modern science, there is now a considerable degree of certainty in treating this previously difficult disease. The so-called four treatments are: (1) Shortwave Diathermy, which uses heat to kill bacteria. Its penetrating power is far greater than that of pigments. (2) Injection of Mixed Gonococcal Vaccine, which achieves the effect of automatic immunization. It can be said to be an extremely reasonable treatment for gonorrhea. Medical communities in various countries are adopting this method. (3) Internal Medication, selecting powerful membrane-penetrating bactericides, such as "Miesha Lin," has the same effect as electrotherapy and injection methods. (4) Local Treatment, in the past, preparations such as silver protein were used. Since the recent invention of the excellent product "Lindu Shule'er" by the German Manerzhi Pharmaceutical Factory, people have been vying to purchase and use it. This medicine is a colloidal substance made from gonorrheal serum, which can achieve the effect of immune sterilization and is a leader among topical medications for gonorrhea. Timely treatment is truly the best method for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Distinguishing the Merits and Demerits of Internal Medicines for Gonorrhea <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Xuannü</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is caused by unclean sexual intercourse, which transmits gonococcal diplococci. The most important treatment for gonorrhea is to kill the gonococci to completely eradicate the disease. This has become common knowledge in modern times. Therefore, the distinction between the merits and demerits of internal medicines for gonorrhea should be based on their ability to kill gonococci effectively. After gonorrhea is transmitted, gonococci invade various parts of the urethra, with the greatest proliferation and latency in the deep part of the mucosa. If the medicinal power of the drug can deeply penetrate the urethral mucosa and kill all the gonococci, the gonorrhea will be cured. Therefore, the quality of the medicine depends only on whether the medicinal power can penetrate the mucosa and kill the gonococci effectively. According to personal clinical experience, the internal medicine for gonorrhea "Miesha Lin" has extraordinary efficacy. Its medicinal power is sufficient to deeply penetrate the mucosa and completely kill the gonococci, and its rapid effectiveness is unique among similar products.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Ringworm and Scabies <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhifang</p>
<p>These two are both types of skin diseases. Their cause is due to the parasitic infection of a type of bacteria, causing unbearable itching. Sometimes, it spreads throughout the body, causing even more pain. It often appears and disappears, spreading to each other, making it extremely difficult to eradicate. There are many types of ringworm, such as serpentine ringworm, groin ringworm, and wet ringworm, etc. Regardless of the type of ringworm, it is due to a lack of skin resistance, resulting in bacterial infection. Scabies is divided into dry and wet types, with the wet type being more severe than the dry type, sometimes even with extremely deep sores, and the healing period is longer. Treatment methods, such as mite-killing agents, salicylic acid, zinc oxide, sulfur, etc., are indispensable medications. The recent "Miejue Jun" is made according to this formula, with accurate curative effects, unlike ordinary products. In terms of electrotherapy, mercury quartz lamps and artificial sun lamps all have considerable effects.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Poor Digestion <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Fangweng</p>
<p>Those suffering from this disease are unable to digest food due to abnormal digestive function of the stomach. The symptoms are also extremely complex, such as unpleasant phenomena such as fullness and pressure in the stomach, vomiting, nausea, belching, heartburn, pain, etc., leading to mental depression and reduced appetite. If left untreated, the consequences are worrying. The treatment method should first pay attention to health preservation, which greatly helps the progress of medicinal power. Avoid mental stimulation, abstain from irritating foods and drinks, and choose foods that are nutritious and easy to digest. Choose medicines that can increase gastric juice secretion, promote gastric wall peristalsis, and restore the stomach's digestive function to normal, such as the "Wei Bao" of Algeri. Other essential aids include regulating eating times and appropriate outdoor exercise.</p>

<h3 id="e222">"Distant Friendship and Close Attack" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Although there was no so-called diplomacy in ancient China, the practice of persuasion was quite prevalent in various dynasties, especially during the turbulent times when various factions occupied their own territories and declared themselves kings. The so-called "alliance" and "connection" during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods originated from the mouths of ordinary persuaders. If it weren't for them, perhaps the six kingdoms would not have split apart; if it weren't for them, perhaps the six kingdoms would not have been able to restrain Qin. Su Qin and Zhang Yi both gained high office with a single insightful view. From a modern perspective, this is the diplomatic battle between countries.</p>
<p>"Distant friendship and close attack" was originally the strategy used by the State of Qin during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to disperse the power of the six kingdoms in order to gradually annex them. Historically, the use of this diplomatic weapon has been seen in various dynasties, and now the imperialists of our eastern neighbor have actually learned this trick. A Tokyo dispatch from the China United Press on February 1 stated that "Japan's policy towards the world has decided to adopt the principle of 'distant friendship and close attack,' so it will exert its strength against the Soviet Union and China to determine the outcome of life and death; while for the international community, it will express multilateralism, trade, and cooperation..." Looking at this telegram, we can see the clear evidence.</p>
<p>The current era is naturally very different from the Spring and Autumn period. Moreover, the Japanese's so-called "distant friendship and close attack" has a different intention from the Spring and Autumn period. On the one hand, they use the name of anti-Soviet "anti-communism" to appease the opposition of international imperialism, while on the other hand, they plan to "operate step by step" to divide our China. Looking at the current situation in the Northeast, North China, and Inner Mongolia, it is enough to make us feel grief and indignation. Recently, conflicts have occurred frequently between the border of Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union, and "Manchukuo," even leading to close combat, which shows that the information in this telegram is not without basis. The Japanese use "distant friendship and close attack" and further conclude a "military alliance" with Germany, the vanguard of the West's anti-Soviet movement, which clearly demonstrates their attempt to dominate the Far East and re-divide the world.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Chocolate Girl <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>— Third Public Performance at the Shanghai Theatre</p>
<p>Following Fudan's "Compromise" and the amateur actors' "Imperial Envoy," now there is the Shanghai Theatre's "Chocolate Girl."</p>
<p>The reason for staging "Chocolate Girl" is probably because comedy is easy to please the audience and attract the audience, right? "Compromise" and "Imperial Envoy" had a lot of audiences, didn't they? But can something with only laughter and no satire be considered a comedy?</p>
<p>When Mr. Chen Dabei was the "exclusive manager" of the Shanghai Theatre, there were two public performances—"Modern Wife" and "Xi Shi." The results of those two public performances were not good: "Modern Wife" had too much of the "civilized drama" flavor; and the so-called musical drama "Xi Shi" was "improved Peking opera."</p>
<p>This time, Mr. Xiang Peiliang has joined. Mr. Xiang usually has at least some research on drama. Therefore, although the previous two performances of the Shanghai Theatre have disappointed me, this time, I still have the courage to watch their third public performance.</p>
<p>However, I am very disappointed. "Chocolate Girl" still gives me a disappointment. — This time, although Mr. Xiang Peiliang is the stage director.</p>
<p>I have not read the script of "Chocolate Girl." I don't even know if there is a Chinese translation. Therefore, I have no way of knowing whether the so-called "adapted by Mr. Chen Dabei" is adapted from the original French, or translated from another language, or adapted from a Chinese translation.</p>
<p>From the intuition gained on the stage, the script of "Chocolate Girl" should be very light, as light as the name suggests, like a chocolate candy that young ladies and young masters love to eat when they are idle.</p>
<p>— Yes, the performance significance of "Chocolate Girl" is only to whet the appetite of young ladies and young masters when they read and watch it. Here it tells you about a "pampered young lady who no one has ever dared to disobey. She is tired of this life. She wants to find a strong man. Paul is very disgusted with her because she is impolite. But disgust will attract attention, and attention will lead to love." It tells you "scolding is love, hitting is flirting." It tells you "Paul lost his marriage and his job, and hates the chocolate girl to the bone. But there is love in hate, and he unconsciously loves the chocolate girl in his heart." — You see, isn't this so-called "comedy" just right for young masters and young ladies to peel chocolate candies and watch?</p>
<p>In terms of performance, "Chocolate Girl" is not as relaxed as the script. Although the laughter is often heard in the audience because of the rich laughter of the script structure (just laughter), those laughs are caused by the script, not by any special skills of the director. — To laugh, the antics of Wheeler and Woolsey, who are famous for their nonsense, will make you laugh even more.</p>
<p>Speaking of the acting skills of the actors, Miss Cheng Jingzi's "Chocolate Girl" is still acceptable, but not noble enough. Because of the lack of nobility, the impression she gives me is just a spoiled little girl acting coquettish. (This is because of the lack of life experience and understanding of the role, which is even more revealed in the lack of grasp of personality in the fourth act). Next, Li Chen, who plays the painter Fei Lixiang, can be counted. Although he is too slick, somewhat close to the slick young men in "foreign-style new dramas," he is still more oily and closer to the clowns in foreign-style new dramas than the gentleman who plays the coachman. However, Li Chen's more natural movements and speech are much better than the stiff mechanical movements of others. Bai Xiongfei, who plays Paul, and Liu Xinzhu, who plays "Chocolate Sister," have movements and speech that are close to mechanical. Chen Dabei, who plays the father of "Chocolate Girl," and Zhu Renhe, who plays the father of Fu Jie, sometimes tighten their throats, and sometimes restore their original voices. The kind of stiff and excessive movements are very annoying.</p>
<p>The makeup of the actors is also not good, and the dark circles around the eyes are a common phenomenon.</p>
<p>What is more commendable is the color of the scenery. The light blue and light yellow colors are very suitable for such a light script. Although the colors in the first two acts are too earthy, and other aspects are also lacking in realism, the use of light colors to match the lighthearted play gives people a sense of lightness, which is good after all.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Raft <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Laoxin</p>
<p>— A Story of the Sea</p>
<p>The small steamer seemed a little overwhelmed, dragging our cargo ships into the Yuan River with great effort.</p>
<p>The four of us muttered inwardly, complaining that the damn machine and light bulb were not working properly, dragging us along like an earthworm, as slow as if it hadn't eaten for seven or eight days. It was already dusk, the sun had fled, and if we didn't hurry to the dock, we would have to wait until tomorrow morning to clear customs. Damn it, clearing customs takes half a day, are we going to play mahjong on New Year's Day tomorrow?</p>
<p>"If we don't make it, I'll kill that opium smoker. This year's New Year is already a bit unlucky, and we still have to be so tired that we can't even celebrate the New Year, that's really unbelievable."</p>
<p>Third Uncle was also anxious, biting on his long pipe. We knew that when we went to other places, this old guy would watch the boat alone. But this time, coming to Wuzhou won't work. He has a relative on Jiufang Street, whether it's a sworn brother or a godson, who is his old flame. This time, he's also running into the New Year. Isn't he going to play a happy game of tianjiu or pai gow? It's a bit like what Lao Qi said—"The old man's heart is not old, turtle!" Who isn't the same?</p>
<p>We could already see the high place that looked like a turret. We also put down a worry.</p>
<p>"Draw ghost legs, treat us to a midnight snack, damn it if you don't come!"</p>
<p>I asked them with a bit of provocation. Although it would take half a day for the cargo ship to dock, the feeling of being extremely constrained was already relieved.</p>
<p>"Come on! Damn it if you don't come! I say: two for two cents, one for four cents, and one is free! How about it?"</p>
<p>Lao Qi was happily chattering, but Third Uncle put on a stern face. —</p>
<p>"Happy? Happy your ass, you guys! The boat hasn't docked yet..."</p>
<p>We were all sensible. Before he could scold us outright, we all stood up. Lao Gui untied the towline, and Wu Shu and I each held one side of the boat steadily, and then we used poles to push it to the dock. At this time, everyone was silent, everyone was quickly pushing, and everyone was full of hope.</p>
<p>The cargo ship docked on the Renhe raft. The crew on the raft were all old friends. After greeting each other, we arranged all the necessary procedures. The cargo couldn't be unloaded tonight, so we let it sit for a day. Third Uncle changed into a silk gown and walked ashore with a sway. We distributed the work, gathered some small money, left Wu Shu to watch the boat, and the three of us whistled and jumped ashore to "shop."</p>
<p>We hadn't been ashore for seven or eight days, and we felt a bit curious. It seemed that everything was so new, and it was also the end of the year. The streets were noisy with firecrackers and thunderclaps, which startled us like "Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden." We didn't know whether to laugh or shout loudly to our heart's content. Lao Qi was a weirdo. He looked at some women dressed like characters on the stage, with faces like monkey butts, and walking like chives twisting and turning. He seemed mesmerized, and used various methods to tease them, looking for happiness. Lao Gui and I found it both funny and annoying. We couldn't find a reason, we didn't know who was wrong or who was right? So, although we bought five pounds of wujiapi wine, half a roast duck, plus some braised dishes, lettuce, fish, and the like, and were ready to rush back to the boat, Lao Qi was still so reluctant to leave. Finally, I slapped him hard and said to him:</p>
<p>"After drinking half a pound, let's go hunting, okay?"</p>
<p>He laughed, and we laughed too. It was the New Year, and we didn't want anyone to fall out with anyone.</p>
<p>Getting off the raft, the raft drifted on the water, and we climbed up a shadow again, remembering the terribleness of life at sea—</p>
<p>"Damn you for three generations, working hard even during the New Year! The money we earn is still spent by that damn guy alone, inviting those sworn brothers to Chen Tang, or taking a few red-card girls to the streets. We're afraid of losing to them! If it weren't for that, we would be celebrating the New Year at home, I really don't know how happy we would be, damn it!"</p>
<p>Our lives are like these rafts made of wood. Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, we spend every day on the water. — "We make a living from the water!" The crew on the Renhe raft treated us as old friends, but we were most afraid of him mentioning Lao Liu. Last Dragon Boat Festival we were still together, now—</p>
<p>"Damn you, if you talk any more, I'll cut off your necks. Lao Liu was born on the water and died on the water, so what?",</p>
<p>In order to easily forget some things, we poured the wujiapi wine into our throats like tea, until we forgot how much we had drunk. I was the first to stand up, a little crazy, with a blurry mind. Our ears only heard everyone raising their voices and singing those messy little tunes:</p>
<p>"Half a chicken, a pot of Yongliwei wine, I walked forward and knelt down,..."</p>

<h3 id="e226">A Visit to the Chiba Soy Sauce Business in Japan (5) <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— (Ye Xiyuan)</p>
<p>I will now excerpt from my diary of the visit at that time:</p>
<p>On June 8th, I took the Joban Line from Ueno Station to Kashiwa Station, then took the local Sobu Line to Noda Station to visit the 17th Factory of Noda Soy Sauce Co., Ltd. I was received and guided by the Manufacturing Department Manager, Mr. Namiki Shigetaro, to visit the various manufacturing rooms: (A) Raw Material Warehouse, using vacuum tubes to transport the soybeans to the refining room for sorting out the good and the bad. The soybeans are put into a washing machine and then transferred to a soybean steaming pot; each pot can hold ten stones of soybeans and takes three hours to steam. The wheat is put into a wheat roasting machine and then transferred to a wheat crushing machine; one machine can roast and crush five stones of wheat per hour. The soybeans and wheat are then transported to the corridor in front of the koji room, mixed with koji seeds, placed in the koji frame, and moved into the koji room to adjust the temperature. After three days, the koji is ready, and salt water is added. It is then transported to the fermentation tank (made of reinforced concrete—what the Japanese call the "Moromi Storage Room" or "Preparation Warehouse"—each concrete tank can hold 100 stones of "Moromi"). Then, it is stirred with air, and after seventeen months, it is transported to a hydraulic press to press the soy sauce. The soybean fat is extracted to make pure soy sauce, and then it is simmered in a cauldron, which is called "Fire Entry" the next day, to mature the soy sauce. It is then transported to the packaging room for packaging. The 17th Factory started construction in March of the 11th year of the Taisho era and was completed in December of the 14th year of the Taisho era, taking three and a half years to build. The construction cost a total of 10 million yen, the total area of the site is 20,000 tsubo, the total area of the buildings is 13,000 tsubo, and the brewing capacity is 150,000 koku. The completeness of its equipment and the grand scale are truly astonishing. After the tour, we went to the Kofu-kai (Community Center) to rest. The company provided 600,000 yen as a foundation, which enabled it to be well managed. It has a lecture hall, an auditorium, a social room, a library, a dining room, and a cooking room, all in good order. After sitting for a while, Mr. Mogi Saheiji, the managing director of the company, came to talk, and then Mr. Mogi invited us to a banquet at the Kofu-kai... It is said that the company produces more than 500,000 koku of soy sauce annually, accounting for more than 20% of the total national soy sauce production in Japan. In addition to being sold in Japan, Korea, and Manchuria, it is also exported to Southeast Asia, the archipelagoes, and the Americas, Canada, and Brazil...."</p>

<p>Old Wu: They've been here too, a big guy came, fat like a pig! Before he even said a word, he started panting, I was really scared by him at the time, I thought he was going to hit someone!</p>
<p>Little Lu: He came to our place too. We didn't think he was going to hit anyone, but we were afraid, his panting was like having an epileptic fit. Later we told him that the harvest wasn't very good this year, the rice shops in the city sell it cheaply, so the buying price has also been reduced, and the land rent and taxes are so high. To be honest, sometimes we don't even have rice to eat from our own fields, where would we get the money to pay the land rent!</p>
<p>Old Wu: So what did he say?</p>
<p>Little Lu: They are really ruthless. That fat pig said, if you don't have cash, grain is also acceptable.</p>
<p>Old Wu: So didn't he hear you say that you don't even have food, so where would you get grain?</p>
<p>Little Lu: Those many heartless beasts, they don't understand human feelings. They don't care about that, and finally, with a stern face, they told us: if you don't deliver it to the bureau in a week, we will send a large number of people to arrest you and take you to court!</p>
<p>Old Wu: Alas! We'll just have to go to court then, we're not rich enough to refuse to pay the rent!</p>
<p>Little Lu: Yes! Screw them, we'll just have to wait and see this year! So, what did he do to you?</p>
<p>Old Wu: Damn it, that big guy had someone tie up our 180-jin sow and take it away!</p>
<p>Little Lu: (Laughing loudly) It can be matched with him! (Both laugh loudly)</p>
<p>A Qiao: (Calling from a distance) Little Lu, come and eat, if you don't come, we'll eat it all.</p>
<p>Little Lu: (Responding) Coming, Old Wu, have you eaten?</p>
<p>Old Wu: I've eaten, go and eat quickly? Come back and chat after you're full.</p>
<p>Little Lu: Let's go to our place, watch us eat, and chat for a while, okay? Let's go, let's go. (Runs off)</p>
<p>Elder Brother: Why didn't you come and eat earlier? You're always playing when you're young!</p>
<p>Old Wu: We weren't playing, we were chatting there, Elder Brother, you eat yours!</p>
<p>Elder Brother: Old Wu, have you eaten? Just eat with us here, so you don't have to bother going back.</p>
<p>Old Wu: I ate a long time ago, you guys eat quickly; it'll get cold later.</p>
<p>A Qiao: Isn't it too hot to eat, why are you so silly? (Everyone laughs, sound of bowls and chopsticks)</p>
<p>Elder Brother: (Saying while eating) After this meal, I don't know where we'll eat the next one.</p>
<p>A Qiao: Who says there isn't a lot of rice left in the bucket?</p>
<p>Elder Brother: (Sneering) There is enough rice to eat for a few more meals, but... (Everyone is silent)</p>
<p>Little Lu: But what? Elder Brother, tell us!</p>
<p>Old Wu: Is it about that big fat guy?</p>
<p>Little Lu: If we have to go to court, I'll go. What's so strange about that? If the year is bad, it's not bad to go inside and live a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Elder Brother: It's not about that, let's eat, we'll talk about it later even if there is something!</p>
<p>A Qiao: What exactly is going on? Elder Brother, are we in danger?</p>
<p>Little Lu: Of course there's danger, otherwise why would Elder Brother be so worried?</p>
<p>Old Wu: I know, is it about the flooding in Shang County?</p>
<p>Elder Brother: That's right, a group of refugees just passed by here, I asked them about the flood situation in Shang County...</p>
