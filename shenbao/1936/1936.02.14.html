<p>日「滿」兵在金廠溝决無非法越界之事實、將衝突實地調查之下、查悉交綏地點、明係「滿洲國」領土、是以日本政府認爲蘇聯抗議毫無理由、决不受理、至於蘇聯政府援助「滿洲國」軍之逃兵與紅軍共同動作、在「滿洲國」領士內肆行非法越界、襲繫日滿軍隊、對於此項事實、决提嚴重抗議、對於上項蘇聯之非法事實、須保留將來一切之發言權、　蘇聯政府萬一不承認日方公正明白之實地調查、並不撤回其非理之抗議、則恐金廠溝事件將封鎖其解决之途、故日本政府値此時期、以確立東亞和平之見地、對於解决該案向蘇聯政府提議、請設立日「滿」蘇實地混合調查委員會、以資辦理也云云、（十三日同盟電）</p>

<p>據十日華盛頓電美國參議院外交委員會主席畢德門在參院中聲稱日本現已撕毀九國公的美國不得不趕造强大之海空軍以維持和平條的之尊嚴此其弦外之音不啻謂美國對於日本之侵略行動應亟起直追而爲實力之制裁按畢氏於去年十二月二十日曾有更明顯之表示其言曰日本今日之野心頗類戰前之德國其目的實在征服全球至於侵吞中國不過爲其初步計劃故美國終有被逼至忍無可忍與日本一戰之日觀此前後二度之演說畢氏之意固明示日美之戰殆無可避免只時間問題耳畢氏爲立法機關之外交領袖其所見如是誠値得我人注意者也</p>

<h3>法國外長解釋　法俄互援公約　運用須根據國聞程序　英決遵守羅卡諾公約</h3>
<p>巴黎　外長佛蘭亭、頃出席衆議院外父委員會、就法俄互助條的有所說明、謂依照該約、卽使兩簽的國之任何一國、未經挑釁、而遭受侵略時、其互助之制度亦不致發生機械式之運用、（按卽不必請求國聯會行政院召集會議、得其認可、而卽出兵援助對方之謂、）在任何情勢之下、所可運用者、惟國聯會盟約所規定之通常程序而已、抑此項條約批准之後、在彼德國自不能援爲口實、以違反凡爾賽條的所規定萊茵河岸撤廢武裝之條欵、（第四十二四十三條）、蓋此等條欵、原不受任何條件之支配者也、萬一德國决議在萊茵河岸重行設防、則法國自當立卽向羅卡諾公的諸簽的國有所接洽、俾得共策應探之步驟也云云、言至此、某委員質訊法國是吾將實行對意禁運煤油辦法、外長答稱、凡國聯會有所决議、法國政府自當力行不渝、但渠仍當審愼注視意阿爭端之發展情形、俾得一退良好機會、卽行設法促進和平解决云云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　下議院頃開會、自由黨議員曼德詢問政府、謂按照羅卡諾公的之條欵、凡爾賽和的第四十二及第四十三兩條、卽關於萊茵河沿岸非武裝區域之條欵、若爲德國（或法國）公然違反、則英國卽當援助法國（或德國）、此際英國政府是吾準備遵守此項條欵乎、艾登外相答稱、羅卡諾公的所產生之義務、英國政府自將予以遵守、過必耍時、决將踐行不渝也云云、據國會人士所知、曼德所提問題、僅指現行條的、未經全體簽的國同意廢止而受違反而言、易詞言之、卽指片面違的行動而言、至玩艾登所作答復、則似政府與曼德之間、事前業已互相商定、而其用意係在暗示德國、任何片面行爲、或强暴舉動、均非英國所許也、此間德國人士、則謂該國政府不擬出於片面行動、而在萊茵河沿岸重行設防、僅欲在法理方面、提出異議、以證明法俄互助條的、與羅卡諾公的之精神字面、均難融洽而已、大抵此事將由關係各國、經由外交途徑、交換意見云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法俄互援公約　法國對德解釋</h3>
<p>不能為萊茵河岸設防口實</p>

<h3>中國亟應舉辦之　生物調查與研究事業（續）</h3>
<p>— 胡先</p>
<p>（e）風景樹之研究</p>
<p>中國產著名風景樹木種類甚多，外國所產之著名風景樹，未經輸入者，亦不在少數。中國各省，現正革新市政，風景樹之研究，實與之有密切關係。此種調查試騐工作，宜由　府獎勵各生物研究機關，如廣山植物團等，担任之者也。</p>
<p>（f）造纸研究</p>
<p>造纸為木材利用最重要之工業。今日吾國對於此業，有學術經騐之人極少，而尤不知從何取材。如雲極鐵杉，皆通常習用之造紙本材，在中國生畏亦甚多，尤以雲杉林在四川有莫大之面積。又吾國昔日造紙，多用竹類，而製造不得法，以至成續不佳。近來印度試騐發明，可以用長成至一年之作紙漿。而國產竹類以何種造紙最為相宜！必須有大規模之調查與研究，方可决定造林政策，廣为提倡栽培也。又如上說之雜種白楊，以及北方最習見之奧椿樹，皆可造紙。凡此種種，皆宜有相當經費，指定由某機關擔任研究也。</p>
<p>g其他與森林有關之工業原料之研究</p>
<p>其他與森林有關之工業原料，種類甚夥。桐油與漆，即為最要者。現在英美各國，正大規模培植桐油樹。吾國桐種與製油之方法，若不改良，將來必不能保持現在之大宗出口。他若各種機維質工業，與人造絲原料工業，松　油之製造等等，森林利用問題，一時不能　舉。而橡皮樹與柏木（teak）栽培之研究，亦開發滇粵桂熱帶地方之要政，且與國防問題有密切關係者也。又近年瑞典某科學家，發明以鳥柏樹種子所產之皮油，烤製為可可。前數年火柴大王卽擬來華設廠製造，後因彼自殺而此議中輟。聞之廬山森林植物園主任秦仁昌君云，彼在丹麦時曾親嘗用皮油製成之可可，其味與眞者無異，而製造法甚為簡單。其專利權只賣十萬元。是亟宜與此發明家接洽。若此業能在中國成立，則又為國家關一新富源矣。凡此種種森林利用工業之研究，皆宜從速由工業與生物學機關連合研究者也。</p>
<p>關於　維植物之研究</p>
<p>維為紡續之原料，其重要不言可喻。織維原料最重要乾為棉。今棉業改進會，已大規模從事此項研究與推廣矣。其次為人造絲，則屬於森林利用與化學工業之範圍。然亦許有他項植物，可以作為人造絲之原料者，是在大規模調查與試騐也。此外之植物　維，最重要者，在中國莫如苧麻。夏布為吾國之特產，然其缺點，在其織維上有一層膠質，故織習以為常發硬而冰體，宜為夏衣而不宜為冬衣，不能代替亞麻以紡麻紗（linen）。若能發明一種漚麻，或化學製麻之方法，以去其膠，則夏布可以機製，而成冬令所需之麻紗，則可增加國富不少矣。又苧麻之葉，可以養囂，此項發明，遠在二十年前吾國已從事囂桑業者，對於此點，毫不注意。今須試騐每畝麻田，能摘葉若干，養囂而不至傷損麻質。野　生苧麻，在吾國到處產之；若一面研究如何改良製麻之方法，一面提倡以苧麻葉養囂，則吾國養器囂，可變為栽植苧麻之副業，其成本旣少，其價目自賤。若再加以養囂方法之種種改良，不雖與日本囂絲角逐於世界日縮之市場也。此外又如麻袋，完全由印度輸入，每年入超之數可觀；若吾國栽培此項原料植特，或以他種機維植特代替之，亦挽回漏扈之道。他種機維植物，可以研究栽培乾甚夥，如新西蘭麻，卽號稱可以取棉而代之者，此類之研究，棉產改進會與中央濃業試騐所，在今日情况之下，皆無暇研究，是宜委託資助現有生物學研究機關擔任研究者也。（未完）</p>

<p>其節目標題，大抵初中較為疏略，高中較為詳密，但其詳略的分量也有不同。例如上古史中講到春秋戰國的歷史，初中部分僅表示「春秋與戰國」和「春秋戰國的學術思想」兩個節目，高中部分就表出「春秋的覇業」，「戰國的七雄」，「中原文化的廣播與疆域的拓展」，「春秋戰國的學術思想」，和「春秋戰國的政制改革」，五個節目；中古史講到秦朝的歷史，初中部分表出「秦代的統一及其政策」和「秦漢的武功」一個半節目；近代史中講到中西交通的歷史，初中部份表出「中西交通的漸盛和西學的輸入」一個節目，高中部份表出「明清之際」，「歐人的東略」，和「基督敎與西方科學的傳人」三個節目；現代史中講到清季革命運動的歷史，初中部份表出綜論「孫中山先生與革命運動」和「辛亥革命和中華民國的成立」二個節目，高中部份表出「革命思想的勃興與孫中山先生」，「清季的革命運動」和「辛亥革命與中華民國的成立」三個節目；又如講到綜論或結論，初中部份表出綜論，只有四個結目，高中部份為為緒論，結論二部，共有六個節目。以上高中敎材和初中敎材分配的詳略，有的為三與一之比，有的為五與二之比，有的為三與二之比，有的為一·五與一之比，其詳細分別的標準，是在該咱事實本身上的重要與否和學生知識上的需要與否為定。</p>
<p>其餘關於作業要項方面，還有一個重要的區別，就是初中方面，規定敎者宜應用綱要，以馭繁博的史實，助學生了解，一面亦可指定敎本中簡明易暁的部份，令學生度作綱要。（即將原文分若干節，每節依次分為小目）使學生練習於史實提綱絜領了解大意的能力。高中方面，主張採用問題式的討論，同時井當練習學生研究問題的能力，因為高中敎學歷史，已有初中三年的基礎。更當注意培養自由學習的能力，敎育當局，會經宣示歷史功課的學習，初中僅取其常職，求能應用，高中則須深切學習，作為學問根本。</p>
<p>最近傳孟眞先生批評「這種課程標準的作者，似未見到幾個貫串上下的原則，但忙於一代一代的堆積題目，弄得讀乾覺得頗像一部策府統宗一類的目錄，這就是只見呆的節目，而沒有看到活的敎法的誤會。」試問初中學生，對於本國史實，毫無槪念。敎以幾個貫串上下的原則，他們能夠懂得麼？傳先生又說：「歷史一科，若想不使學生反感，而收到設此一課的效用，與其多說此事，而說不明白；不如少說些事，而說得明白。一央鑲牙敎科書者，格於製定標準，有此事不得不說，其情可原，但因此發生的幣端，要設法改正才好，無論敎部方面或編者方面。」傳先生根據上述的理由，定下列一個則，就是：「在規定的字數及時限內，將歷史事件之件數减少到最低限度，将每一歷史事件之叙述，充分到最大限度。」關謚這個原則，個人極端表示贊同，但這種辦法，是適宜於編　高中的敎科書，而不宜於編　初中的敎科書。</p>
<p>對於初中和高中歷史敎材的支配問題，似乎已經引起了人閃的注意。本年中學本國史敎科富編　會，發出微向啟事，就到這個問題，他們對於道分配的問題的解答是這樣；　在初中採用緃的劃分，在高中採橫的劃分，所謂縱的劃分者，即是將歷史的縱方面，如民族的門爭和離合，國境的開拓，物質生活的變遷，社會結構的演化……等等，分別叙述，各方面從古及今，自為段落，他們以為這種方法，最宜於簡要的鳥瞰和現狀的溯源，這些正是初步的歷史智識所需要的。所謂橫的劃分，即是以整個的時代為段落，其目的在顯示，各時代的特殊面目，他們以為這正適合於歷史之深刻的認識。　在初中詳今略古，詳近略遠，在高中則各時代的叙述，力求比較的平均，他們以為初中的歷史敎材，應側重解釋一央，以大槪而論，愈近的歷史對於一央的影響愈深，故應當愈詳，高中的歷史課程，應當側得各時代之比較深　刻的認識，故需要比較平均的叙述。这種意見，很値得注意。</p>
<p>現在初高中敎材的分配，雖有詳略的分別，但皆以屬節目式的排列，又同以時代為限斷，頗有得複的弊病，且高中節目，較初中更為繁碎，對於歷史上整個中心問題，也有不易表示的地方，似乎有改進的必要，好在課程標準作業要項裏面，說明初中學生，應該將簡明易暁的部份，試作綱要，以培植了解大意的能力；高中學生，主張採用問題式的討論，以培植研究事物的能力，可以挽救這個弊病。據個人的意見，初中學生年齡尚幼，對於本國史實的普通常識，未有接愛的機會，應將歷史的政治·軍事·疆域·社會·經濟·交通·外交·宗敎·學術·文藝諸端，提綱絜領，作為普通的講授，而且要以時代為主幹，使學生對於各時代各事件的槪况，有普充沛的常識，而不必於特種時事，加以詳細之解研究，至於高中學生，年齡旣長，普通歷史知識，已有根祗，不妨將歷史上最重要而與現代生活有關的事件，加以詳細的檢討，此種事件可以整個頭號題為敎材，例如國家政制問題，社會組織問題，土地頭號題，經濟問題，風俗問題，選舉問題，考試問題，監察問題……等等，皆可作為研究的質料。</p>
<p>綜上二點，純以敎材為對象，一個是屬於敎材的範圍問題，一個是屬於敎材　程充　題，無論敎者編者，似宜加以注意，此外敎科書雖為敎育上最重要的工具，但講授材料，應該由敎者加以靈活的運用，切不可為課本所限定他們讀書的方法，使他們自己能夠　出他們應該研究的問題，對於圖表和器物，尤宜儘量的應用，不但使學生得到明確的觀念，而且得到實用的知識。</p>
<p>但近來我國歷史敎育的失敗，漸漸為一般學術界所公認，因為近來敎授歷史的人們，主張打破朝代的限制，所以一班投考大在學的高中畢業生，對於朝代的前後，大都說不清楚。其他事實，亦缺乏時代的觀念，對信產，學生歷史程度低落，報章雜誌幾笑百出，據又報記載，有的把禹認為一個朝代，而周夏並列，有的把東漢列在西漢之後，有的把隋唐列於兩晉之前，有的以西漢為東漢所滅，北宋為　所　，或南宋所滅，有的以西漢為　所滅，金為明所滅，有的以宋朝開國皇帝為李世民，也有以清朝開國皇帝為袁世凱的，有的以張居正　司法院長，于謙為考試院長，有的以造鐵路為五安有變法之一種，這種種錯誤，出於高中學生的手，　是　想所不到，但在歷史敎科書方面决没有这样離奇的錯誤，當然不能負責，應當負責的，就是學校和敎員。因為許多中等學校，對於史地實在過於輕視，有的講歷史沒有課外參考，和各種圖表，設備多半欠佳，學校規模較大的，目有專任歷史的敎員，至於親模小的學校，則往往出他科敎員兼任，在中學擔任歷史敎職的，熱心者固大有人在，但敷衍了事的，更在所多有。至於學生方面，愛了學校輕視和敎員敷衍的影響，對於歷史功課，若有若無，對於歷史與社會國家民旗與喪得失的關係，史非所注意。這種學生，怎能成為健全的國民，這種敎員，又怎能挽救國難於萬一昵？因為前此中等歷史敎育失敗的結果，所以我們希望編　敎科　的人，固當加以努力，但學校當局和敎授歷史的敎員，更當猛自反省，切不可如從前的輕視敷衍，灰後學生的知識程度，自是可以提高，否則，不但為敎育界的罪人，也是社會國家民族的罪人。（完）</p>

<h3>塞漠生活考察記</h3>
<p>— 金兌</p>
<p>我們爲了研究西北的興趣，去年組織西北考察團，夏間從廣州出發。費了八個月的時間，歷游察哈爾，山西，綏遠，內蒙，寗夏，甘肅，靑海，陝西等省區的野原和市鎭，對於西北社會生活各方面，作了一番詳細的調查。這决調查的報吿正在整理中，現在選出一部分來，先在報上發表。</p>
<p>一·內蒙伊克昭盟的風俗</p>
<p>伊克昭盟是在綏遠省境的南部，面積的佔全省三分之一，下分七旗。大宗土產爲馬，半，羊，駱駝，口磨各種獸皮和羊毛以及甘草等藥材。馬牛多銷於晋豫陝諸省，皮張則經平津或石家莊，順德等處，轉運滬上行銷海外：草多由河套裝船，由黃河輸入內地各省銷售。甘草船每幫恒數百艘，其產量與銷路可知。外此尙產火狐，狼皮，掃雪尾（卽貂奴），野羊皮（俗呼黃羊）。該處另產一種靑山羊皮，特別美麗，毛長的五分，光耀奪目，驟視之如洋灰鼠，每伴皮袍僅七八一元，確算價廉物美。該盟各旗和陝西的楡林，神木，綏遠的包頭等處一樣，特產一種毛織褥氈，並非機器織造，係用手工製成，質地堅固，花樣精巧，每一褥氈，可經用數十年之久，價亦不昻，每方尺不過二元。惟此氈不怕用而怕藏，藏起來最易生蟲脫毛，愈用光澤愈明亮，數十年後，竟可作古物出售，其價値比新購倍增。</p>
<p>伊克昭盟所屬七旗婚喪風俗，大半相同。蒙女出嫁，多以羣馬羣羊作嫁妝，小康人家的陪嫁妝奩馬一二百匹，羊四五百隻；貧者亦陪馬數十匹，羊百數隻不等。結婚三日，新郞新婦各乘紅馬一匹，馬身滿披紅綠彩綢，男女來賓均各乘馬護送，新郞身背弓矢，至夫家交拜天地，由來賓送入洞房。</p>
<p>蒙人父母歿，子女均哀哭，葬時請喇嘛主禮，將死者屍體，棄於野外沙漠間，並唸經使死者超昇，翌日或隔三日往視，禽獸喫了屍身，就認爲吉利，不然的話，要另延其他喇嘛祝禱，或移屍他處，直到給禽獸果腹。方纔放心，這就是天葬。較富的人家，也用火葬。葬時用白布緊纏屍身，屍往山後灶坑裏，以多量的柴火焚起來。死者的兒女們，都解散髮辮，穿衣服掛孝，一月卽止。每逢忌日，亦請喇嘛唸經，除夕則有哭泣追念的習慣。至於上墳祭掃的風俗，在那里是沒有的。</p>
<p>二、女子中心的青海土番</p>
<p>靑海土番性情强悍，最喜喝酒。殺人向不抵命，僅以資產若干，賠償命價卽可了事。往往有因殺人而傾家蕩產的。男子多遊手好閒，不事生產，家事完全操在女人手裏，贅婿的風氣盛行，俗謂招夫生子。男子，二十歲左右卽贅入人家，專依靠女子度日。男子的職業，僅爲部落裏的公共事業，如守望，遷徙，交換，或對外爭鬥等等，婦女則擔任六歲，改作婦人髮辮，便算成婚，生男養女，並不究自何來。子女長成，往往不知其父何人。男女在未婚嫁前，大都各有所私。婦女懷孕時，工作一如常日，生產亦極平易。有的在山中放牧牛羊的時候，忽產嬰兒，於是抱歸帳中，拋放於地，覆以羊皮，又復出外工作。小孩二三歲時，他的母親常用毛繩的一端，縛住他的脚腔骨上，他端栓在帳房柱上、</p>
<p>婦女的衣服，身長及地，兩袖甚短，只穿一件，內無襯衫，更不着褲子，腰束布帶，冬日足登皮靴，夏天赤脚，靴子男女通用，式樣相同。婦女的頭髮，編成無數小辮，的數百根，積一兩月梳洗一决，每决需整天的工夫。首飾用銀釵環興瑪瑙石，耳環用銀釧，下垂兩串姍瑚，束身帶前方，掛以半斤重銅鈞，鈎上有粗布手帕一方。後腦髮垂下地，亦栓以多量的銅器石子。衣服日披夜蓋，冬夏常穿的是沒面羊裘，裸出右臂，袒露乳房。每日淸晨，用半馬糞燒茶一鍋，男女圍繞灶頭，主婦坐在旁邊，炒麵。各人喝够了茶，將碗交付主婦，盛上酥油一大片，炒麵一大撮，大家用手拌而食之，食罷再飲一二碗茶。做母親的對於子女惟一的敎育，就是令學習唱歌。子女唱歌唱得多，唱得好，在母親看來是量榮幸的事。</p>

<h3>蔣院長在中政校演講　青年為學與立業之道（二）</h3>
<p>其次大家要曉得我剛才所講的許多話、不過是說明大家亦應負的革命責任、並指示一條做人立業的正確途徑而已、至於要負起勻們的責任、循着合理的途徑努力前進、達到我們理想的，還要靠各人能夠刻苦力行、終始實踐、就是要立定救國救民的大志、自强自治的精神、不斷的剷除一切舊染之惡習邪念、從而改變氣質、提高品德、完成人格的修養、現在各位在學校裏求學、一切學問知識的修養、當然要取法於師長、要誠懇接受師長的敎訓、但是一個人的學問道德、要有真正的成就、要樹立卓犖的人格、完全要靠自己、雖有賢父兄與良師益友都只能從旁指導督促而已、而且這種敎導督促的力量、也很有限、可以說一個人要眞能夠成功立業、完全要靠自己能夠立志、能夠自治自强、古人所謂「學先立志」所謂「自强不息」、所謂「愼獨存誠」「克己復禮」、都是這個意思、我們敎育能不能發生效果、就是看能不能使學生養成這種自强自治的人格、各學生要知道自己一切學問事業將來能不能成功、也只看現在有沒有自强的精神和自治的能力、就可以斷定，所以我們學校的敎育、雖採嚴格的軍車管理的辦法、但是精神上特別要注重人格敎育、要養成學生自動自治自强自立的精神和能力，造成眞正的革命人格、我們一般學生個個要不管而自理、不敎而自善、不助而自立、不勉而自成、如果我們的敎育到了這個地步、學生的修養到了這種程度、那末這種精神和人格的力量、就比什麼力量都大、我們有了這種力量、雖然沒有槍砲、外國人不僅不敢隨便來侵略壓迫、而且不敢不敬重我們、現在我們之所以被人家隨便侵侮壓迫、就是因為自己不能自强自立、這就是古人所謂「人必自侮、然後人侮之必的道理、現在普通一般學生、無論上學下課、或是在外面、遇見師長、都不曉得敬禮、這樣視師長如路人、不是直接輕慢師長、間接侮辱自己嗎、你中國人自己要侮辱自己、怎樣能叫外國人不來輕視你侮辱你、所以我們對於一般部下、和－般學生、所希望的、第一件事、並不是要有多大的學問才幹、而是要他做－個自重自治自强自立的人、尤其是要他做一個中國人、要他知道做中國人的道理、就是首先要有中國倫理的修養、就是做父母的要慈愛子女、做子女的要孝敬父母、做師長的要愛護學生、做學生的要尊敬師長、總之、無論何時何地、要明禮義、知廢恥、重倫理、守紀律、就是要我們政治學校的學生、先來恢復我們中國固有的美德「忠孝仁愛信義和平」、定要如此、才算是一個真正的中國人、然後一切的聰明才智、纔能為國家為民族而用、現在我們政治學校、雖然有了這樣好的精神、紀律、但是我們切不可自滿自足、一定要發揮自强不息的精神再求進步、而艮不僅我們一個學校要要好而已、更要由我們造成一個明禮義知廉恥負責任守紀律的風氣、使今國各大學的風氣都能轉移過來、才可以達到建立一個現代的新中國之目的、最後再要講到我們自治自强之實踐的工夫、簡單的講，就是要從我們日常生活習慣起做、見善則遷、有過則改、光能將我們舊染一切頹唐腐敗浪漫自私的生活習慣以及種種惡劣的思想行動、一件一件剷除淨盡、如此日新漸進的結果、自然可以改變氣質、成功一個品德高尙、志業違大的人、無論那個人、天性本來都是善的、但是環境不良的習染物慾、惡劣的引誘、也是人人所不能免的、所貴乎敎育與修養者、就是要劃除一切不良的習染與慾念、而發揮他先天固有的德性、所以過失是人人所有的、只要能改過遷善、人人都可以為聖賢、古人說、「凡人不患有過、而患文過、不貴無過、而責改過」、這兩句話可說我們自强自治做人立業最繼好的格言、一切存養省察的工夫、都要由此做起、此外還有古人所講最要緊的一句話所謂「為學第一在變化氣質」（薛瑄語）古今中外一切偉大的人物、都是由此做起、我剛才所講要自治自强其目的也就是要「變化氣質」、具體的工夫就是要革新我們的生活習慣思想行勸、最後要將一切壞的氣質都澈底的改變為善的氣質、必須能自治自强改變氣質、然後可以做成一個非常的人、建立一番大的事業、我們眞能克制自己改移痼習變化氣質、便沒有什麼敵人不能克制、沒有什麼事業不能完成、道「變化氣質」的意思、照現在的新名詞就是說「改變人生」我們要改變人生就先要改變生活、要改變生活就先要確定革命的人生觀、革命的人生觀、是什麼、我所體認與篤行的眞理、就他認「生活的目的，在增進人類全體的生活、生命的意義在創造宇宙繼起的生命」、中言之人生真意養和目的不是為自己儀人的而是為全體民衆的、不過她過去的、也不是僅為保守現在一時的、而他為創始將來永久的、本校長從前少年的時候、亦有不良的環境、並不是沒有過失、甚至在二十歲左右，連自己的身婦都不很好、但是到後來自己立志奮發刻苦鍛鍊種種健身立品的生活、時時勉强力行例如我在日本高田做入伍生的時候、那個最冷的地方、無論雪怎麼大，天怎麼冷、我每晚就突寢前、一定用冷水擦身、早晨起身後、一定用冷水洗面、習慣養成之後、長期不曾間斷、至今每天早晨第一次還是用冷水洗臉、有此持久不斷的精神、纔能夠改移病習、變化氣質、所以自己身體和精神今年快要到五十歲還是很好、能吃得起辛苦、無論做什麼事、都可以和你們青年比賽、至於事功成敗，則吾不敢知、若說德行修養、則吾敢自信、繼此以往、多少必有成就、各位要知道要改移痼習變化氣質、並不是一件容易的事、但是只要你能立定意志、必可以達到目的、例如曾國藩從前嗜好吸潮烟、風次想戒都被不成功、因此他感覺戒烟、比打仗還專艱難、但是到後來立定志向、持之以恒就能完全戒除、其事雖小可以見大、曾國藩所論「古稱金丹換骨、余謂立志即金丹」、我們要改移痼習、變化氣質、總非立志不可、你們一般學生能夠升到大學、一定都是來自溫飽之家、過中等以上的生活、如果你們以後仍舊安於溫飽、不能立定救國救民的大志來訓苦奮鬥、那就是溫飽的家庭葬送了你們、你們進到本校如果不能立志奮發、以為畢業後可以升官發財、那就你們斷送了革命黨、也可以說革命黨斷送了你們、大家總要記得我們革命黨、是一個很窮很苦的大家庭、我們的總理和一般先烈不知道犧牲了多少心血、經過了千萬回的艱難奮鬥、才有今天、我們政治學校全體師生、就是這個大家庭裏所遺下的孤兒弱女、全靠你們為這個家庭擔負起承先啟後的責任、）今後必須立定救國救民之大志發揮自强自治的精神、養成革命的人格、增進實用的學問、大家親愛、精神刻苦耐勞共同一致為國家為民族來奮鬥犧牲、以造福人類創造世界、然後可以完成本校學生所負的使命、今天集合我們全校師生和各位高級將領、在此處講話機會很難得、尤其是蒙藏的學生你們志在四方、將來可以為國家做的事業格外遠大、希望大家記住我今天和去年開學的時候，所講的話、切實努力、（完）</p>

<p>（一七六）</p>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「俺在結裏」一個小聲音回答道，其時唐恩把坦第　到她的懷裏，他却又緊拘唐恩一下，而且又說道，「俺的唐乃經天敎顧我，我是曉　的」（註）</p>
<p>蜀夫人旋轉頭去謝謝那忠誠的看護，可唐恩正在抓走邢些童子、她們正　在門衖裏去迎接她，一并且輕聲說道，「退後些；她現在沒有統神和我們說話。」</p>
<p>「不，不要退去。你們一起，我都要的。進來看我罷，我的孩兒們。我已經把你們丟了許多時了，」蜀夫人說時伸出她的兩隻手給齣歲惆；做們也就圍住了她，陪她進了她的房間，一路不多說話，然而表出的情感却又不少，因為他們　關切的眼色和呆笨的小舉動來顯示他們的憂思與同情。</p>
<p>她於是為了他們勉自愉快地說道，「我倦極了，我要躺在這裏，吃抱坦第，你們送我些茶罷。」</p>
<p>（註）俺一我，這松裹！這裹唐乃唐恩經天！整天敎馴！照顧曉曉！好好。</p>

<p>戰鼓再奪中、翁仁安造成平手、馮陸烘雲托月、又占前程、周達雲兩投兩中、四度平等、此際戰情之緊張、有使人心曠神怡、此起彼落、總在一球之先往耳、</p>
<p>相持至四十對三九，（東華占先、看看時間、尙有五分、那知近丟近射、着着奏效、乃以四三對四十一躍登先、從茲以後、協興遂撥雲霧見青天、周徐兩將、籃下探討、身高手長、順利非凡、東華反呈晚境坎坷之態、危局難挽，結果被協興以五五對四六之比奏凱、</p>

<h3>吾國出席世運會　競走祗派一人之理由</h3>
<p>中華競走会为此次參加世運競走人数、祇派一人、特致函體協會、請求增加人數、俾成勁旅、昨由該會沈嗣良君復競走會史人友惠君、限於經費，心餘力絀、頗難接受等語、茲將該函摘要、探錄於後、</p>
<p>查此次本會董事議决、我國派往參加世邐會人數、當時審愼考慮、蓋以預算經費之限制，不得不愼重視察各項運動成續之優秀者、詳加討論、酌予派往、乃不得已之苦衷耳、再查競走運動、係徑賽項目中之一次、此次規定人數、實可包括在田徑之內、董事諸公以第六屆全運會時、該項表演之第一名成續、尙接世界紀錄，乃特為另行明晰規定、較諸田徑人數十二人尙不敷分配、每一項不及一人者、實已顯示獎勵競走運動之意矣、復按來函、以競走職員並未規定、將來比賽時引進乏人、深為遠慮云云、此點當會讓時，亦早已顧及、然以經費牽掣、未能另行規定、屆時引進之職、或可委田徑職員兼任、此與游泳項目同屬一例、總之、此點參加世運、性質實係觀摩國際技術、俾為借鏡、祇以經費枯絀、難以儘量派送體育專家、與運動人材、協會同人、殊引為歉仄者也、（下略）</p>

<h3>銀價匯兌俱縮外滙趨勢略緊</h3>
<p>英美美孚皆有結欵一天過程絕為平和</p>
<p>滙市昨以大條及滙兌俱縮而略緊、但過程絕為平和、晨初以海外銀市報來倫敦大條近縮零六二五、遠縮一八七五、紐約銀市停市、蒙得里遠期銀價個跌一厘半、倫敦生金漲二便士半、英對美縮六二五、英對法跌、磅音、美對英美對法俱停逐步中央銀行掛牌揭暁、英平而美縮二五、海關金單位漲四厘、人心稍挺　　晨開、近期賣價英匯一先令二便士四三七五、美滙三十元零六二五、較之前收、計英緊零三一二五、美緊零六二五、開後人心不定、銀行趁賤尚扒、滙豊銀行掛牌揭暁、英美俱平、過程平定、入後白銀平衡稅揭暁跌半分、但英美烟公司略結現先令、大勢仍定、入後成交不多、趨勢呆滯、然因美孚火油公司進二月份美金、仍形穩定、後市成交更稀、缺乏活分理處、印銀初次報小二安那、二次回長一安那、銀行趁賤略扒、過程平庸、延至收盤近期賣價、英滙一先令二便士四三七五、美滙三十元零六二五、較之前收、計英緊零三一二五、美緊零六二五、遠期亦然、華商缺乏活動、英美烟公司結先令、美孚扒美金、今將一天成交錄後、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市仍視實銷轉移</h3>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、局益覺和平、因倉庫中存紗仍無流動能力、賣方心意尚屬安定、市價益呈徘徊之勢、但現紗客方需求不薄、前途之變遷、須依實際銷場為進退也、</p>
<p>標紗先漲後挫</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近月平靜、拍至二盤以後、市盤趨向高境推進、以現紗生意起色、春銷頗有發展氣象、故人心良好、場中新賣者缺乏、三收盤市氣轉趨高翔、四月期穿出二百元關外、結果各月比上日收盤價漲四八角至一元一二三角、午後開盤平淡、因大阪三品紗漲跌互見、上下二四角、空方議論、倉庫存紗不動、市况轉挫、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五六七八角、查賣出大孚八百包、裕大七百包、合興六百五十包、賡豊七百五十包、大豊五百包、買進通記四百五十包、大豊四百包、達記四百包、達記四百包、大昌成二千八百包、潤康六百包、信誠九百包、同和三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚堪維持、查全日各邦成交一千二百三十五包、售價晨漲一元、午跌五角、各帮買額如下、</p>
<h3>近期花多頭仍拉提</h3>
<p>棉花晨進午退、因大量集中之通記多額、存賬已達八萬擔以外、在近月依然拉提不放、人心激昂、市傳對於本月决意收貨、然查低價時已回漲二元光景、海外印棉四五月期白洛去棉、比上月價尚跌十四五羅比、美棉亦平平云、</p>
<p>標花浮空抵補</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、市象甚堅、且場中買戶活動、市上議論紛紛、謂多頭準備收貨、在近期拉緊不放、局勢堅挺、二盤以後漲氣益濃、浮空抵補又急、六七月穿出三元關外、迨至收盤、有一部分多頭吐，略形鬆　、結果各月比上日收盤價、均漲一角至三角半、午後　盤近月微小、一角至五分、遠月向跌、二盤以後平靜、以紗市無力、呈呆滯不前之狀、迨至速月、忽見鬆懈、結果近漲五分、遠跌二角至二角半、查賣出愼昌一千八百擔、大孚二千八百擔、賡豊一千一百擔、義成二千三百擔、益昶一千二百擔、信誠三千四百擔、源興昌一千八百擔、長和三千八百擔、肉中刺和三千四百擔、買進賡豊一千三百擔、吉豊二千九百擔、梅記二千四百擔、大豊三千八百擔、愼記一千五百擔、大昌成三千擔、長豊二千七百擔、永大二千五百擔、益康一千九百擔、大昶二千一百擔、一日間最高抵價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉廠需不斷</p>
<p>現棉消費尚屬不惡、廠需續而不斷、來源姚共二百五十包、</p>
<p>美棉停市中之英印棉</p>
<p>昨美棉因林肯誕辰停市、英棉現貨漲一點、期貨跌二點、印棉投機家及期貨商　進為套賣所抵銷、計平果爾漲〇·七五至一·二五羅比、奧姆辣及白羅溪不動、原電錄左、（十二日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十三日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為一百九十五羅比、與上日收盤同、</p>
<p>十三日大阪電、三品期紗漲二至四角、近月為一九一元五角、遠月為一九一元四角、期棉跌一角至三角、近月為六一元五角、遠月為五九元零五分、</p>
<p>本市日紗一月中出口統計</p>
<p>本埠日廠棉紗一月中銷量統計為二萬三千七百四十八包、比上年十二月中這三萬〇五百三十九包、减少六千七百九十一包、查其銷量、上海一萬四千九百八十一包、查其銷量、上海一萬四千九百八十一包、天津二千八百二十五包、印度一千一百九十四包為最鉅、茲將運往各地情形錄下、（單位包）</p>
<h3>糧食粉麦漲後又遭挫折</h3>
<p>初以實銷活動而漲終以多頭出售回落</p>
<p>粉市北銷仍活、南洋零銷亦旺、市面頗形活潑、當上午開盤時、適洋麦報漲四角、利物浦澳洲一律報漲、乃引起浮空之抵補、與業外浮多之問津、市價立即飛升二三四分不等、尤以近期為實銷問津見俏、但市價張後、各廠即趁高拋出、大戶多頭旋踵售出、市况又見回落一三分、但午後客銷仍活、收市尚形穩定云、</p>
<p>麦市上午開盤後、以洋麦報漲標粉飛升、現粉活潑、故補空與新多頭均有活動近期立漲四五分、遠月漲四分及一二份不等、但午後以標粉回落、人心又軟、且有內地行廠拋套、各月份均見跌落、現麦通日到銷兩淡、行販心思甚堅、意在喊高至五元三角、而進戶祇吃五元二角五分、致未售開云、</p>
<h3>米市續見疲軟</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到二三十號、（貨共六千石左右、）本街銷場仍屬清淡、包胃亦僅由青島烟台帮辦法二千包左右、故形勢見軟、市况續疲、結果厚早粳價修五分、薄稻削一角、惟杜洋尖及阻變元則以供求兩平、無甚上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路、來源十七八號、市上白粳去路、店　呆而無神、價又疲小近角、早稻跟小角許、薄稻零銷平淡、價疲小數分至一角、羊秞續有到貨零目不　、市况完立杜　客尖無甚上落、白元零化清淡、市有轉疲之勢、其餘各貨、價續見軟勢、</p>
<h3>客秈昨祇本街銷塲</h3>
<p>昨日客仙到頭、浙東各路已見减少、長江一帶仍有江西沙漢各埠裝到五六千包、而去路客銷久滯、天津一度問訊後、昨日祗去　　元米二百包、但津帮胃口尚佳、除办装河下薄稻外、會向行號直接配裝洋米、故前日會有一萬多包裝出、昨客秈統由本街辦去、計贛米二千多包、沙漢台州呼米五百多包、行情與前市相似、而形勢則居平軟云、</p>
<h3>油市油豆餅後市復漲</h3>
<p>芝麻期現均見沉寂</p>
<p>昨標準油豆餅各市一律報漲、因大連市面看好、當地市價又在過跌之後、逐引起出口與囤補之問訊、昨電餅豆兩市回好一二分及四五分不等、而油市跌風亦緩、祇有一角及五分之出入、且大連金票日縮、故本市人心又紛紛望好、兼以本市車輪各現豆已有粵閩各帮與車廠之問訊、多日呆滯之連豆油廠油等、昨日亦有四百五十件之實銷、標油上午一度被了結壓落後、午後立見飛騰、收市價反見因漲三四角、標準車豆漲五六分、洋荘芝麻以出口久滯、標凖車豆漲五六分、洋荘芝麻以出口久滯、標凖與現貨均見沉寂、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨西裝銷路最暢</h3>
<p>海律斯呢激漲一元</p>
<p>昵絨毛織品、爾來客帮績有動辦、公益會交易活潑、貨價挺秀、本街門荘帮、需要稍懈、蓋因前次早多進足、須待稍稍脫售以後、方能再進、惟西服帮则動辦烈、各種光毛呢絨套頭及大衣料等、咸有成交、海律斯呢、每碼分料竟激漲一元、舊售四元之普通黃·紅·灰·墨錄等海律斯、現則一律激漲至五元、樣板零剪、價達五元四五角、致買方刻尚無意添配、將待至顧宮廷選定以後、方肯照樣剪配也、究其漲價原因、無非係定價高昂、關金外滙上漲、以及新貨到貨缺乏所致耳</p>
<h3>府綢漂白布加入呌荘</h3>
<p>昨為週四、逢元芳洋行第二千九百七十六次叫荘、排列各貨七十九箱、泰西綢價尚平局、元絨升漲微細、元羽綢各見遜色、時交春令、加叫府綢三箱、藍洋布三箱、及白府綢白漂布七箱、</p>
<h3>五金青鉛趨勢挺</h3>

<h3>經濟恐慌中金融界應有之責任　（二績）</h3>
<p>— 趙華</p>
<p>根據此種情形觀察，金融界對於國內工商及生產事業扶動、似不能謂為放棄責任，然而工業之凋敝也如故，商業之不振也如故農村之衰落也如故，甚且工廠停工，廠基拍賣、商店倒閉，日趨劣境，非週轉不靈，即原料不繼，一方面金融四時八節以巨額資金，扶助國內生產事業之發展，一方面生產事業則日趨　敗，此種矛盾現象，吾人不能不認為奇特，益當研求其原因矣。在工商業身，固由於經營之失敗，資本薄弱，出品不多，組織不能完善，管理未能得當，計劃未能週密，基礎未能鞏固，甚至工廠尚未開工，資金業已告罄，左支右絀，邊論發展，此種情形，固已數見不鮮。而在金融界本身，吾人認為尚未能澈底乾則在中心政策之未能一致確定。夫銀行之業務至繁，而放欵尤為發展國民經濟之關鍵，放欵中心政策之未能一致確定。夫銀行之業務至繁，而放欵尤為發展國民經濟之關鍵，放欵中心政策，不能確定，所收之效果亦微，所謂中心政策乾，即應確定本身扶助國民經濟之目標。例如勸業盆腔行，其中心目標，應為發展實業。商業銀行其中目標應為發展工商業。而在同一性質之勸業銀行農業銀行商業銀行，又應各有其最重之中心目標。何者以扶助　　絲綢為目標，何者以扶助紡織業為目標，何者以扶助鄕村合作社為目標，何者以扶助內地小工商為目標，雖非絕對以此為放欵範圍，然對於此種中心上目標之生產事業，應始終一貫輔助；且廠方之組織，原料之採辦，廠務之興革，出品之市場，在在均予以連貫之扶助，旣不使此種事業有不正當之經營，復不使有資金週轉不　之痛苦，如此則金融界之放欵，得以安全，而所扶助之生產事業，亦能維持於不隊。故有一貫輔助之精神，固定不移之政策，方得謂之中心政策，在以往情形，頗多以臨時環境之變遷為轉移，某種事業這一時興盛，則多數集中於此種事業繁榮，某種事業在艱難締造之中，又多數裏足不前，即已扶助之專業，對於事業內容，經營狀况，又多漠不過問，及至失敗，　　無及。逐形成一種現象，在一時興盛之事業，固感覺過分競爭，而關係得要垂危之事業，或且任其自行崩潰。在平日索不注意，及至騰耗發生，山窮水盡，除沒收　基外，毫無他法，銀行逐坐　捐失，被其拖累，甚至資金呆擱，同歸於盡。凡此情形，均未能確定本身中心政策之所致，金融界對於生產事業，固不能負維持到底之義務，然荀能注意此種事業之興革情形，設非重要變遷，則亦不致感覺有維持到底之痛苦。對於金融界本身，亦可謀放欵安全，又豈僅發展產　已耶。</p>
<p>（三）提倡商品運銷溝能內地信用</p>
<p>近年業內地金融，尤感覺特殊痛苦，市面衰落，錢業尤在不景氣之中。逐至工商凋零一蹶不振。內地產業之不振，即影響於都市。吾國索以農業立國，內地繁榮，關係至巨，內地產業，何以不能發展，一方面由於商品運銷之不能推廣，一方面由於內地信用之未能溝充沛。在金　業固已竭忠盡智力謀內地金融之流分理動矣。然而金融業亦自有本身之立場，　　放疑，固屬必需，放欵過多亦殊危險，不得不趨向於抵放欵之一途。小工小商，固不能袖手旁觀，坐視不救，然亂投藥石，毫無保障，亦可危及本身。金融業固有繁榮內地產業之决心，自不可无繁荣内地產業之良好方策。　就管見略述兩端。</p>
<p>提倡內地商品運銷　內地金融，週轉不　，工廠商家更感困難。金融業以抵押放欵為原則，而內地工商業料應有符合金融業需要之條件，雙方合作，主能進行順利。故目前最需要要者。厥為組織有力量之運銷機關，增加商品運銷之效能。此種機關，第一須有金融機關之力量辦理押匯押欵，以扶助商品之流動；第二須有溝通各地市場之原索，以便利商品運銷及原料採購；第三須採用實物放欵之方式，以收內地金融流通實效。運銷機關，以扶商品介紹金融業投資為宗旨，其服務事項，　代理商品及原料之購買運銷，　代理運送及其附屬事項，　代辦押欵押匯，　代理收付貨欵，　指導改良品質及區分等級，　協助政府騐查　雜作偽，　推廣銷路寄送貨樣，　調查市况報告商情，凡此種種，均直接間足以促成內地商品之流通者也。</p>
<p>推行內地信用證書　提倡商品運銷，固可促成內地商品之流動，然此僅以金融業力量代為辦理運銷購買事務，內地出產品之不能流通，無代銷機關當為一端，但內地信用之不能溝通，尤為重要。縣與縣之間，相去數百里，何以甲地產品不能行銷乙地，其原因至為簡單。蓋乙地之購貨人，不能取得甲地廠商之信用，不敢直接發貨，而甲地之廠商，亦以交通不便，信息不　，不能取得乙地購貨人之信用。不敢貿然委託。除非甲地廠商派員往乙地推角，或乙地購貨人携欵親往甲地採購，則變方無完成此項交易之可能。兩地間信用，有此種隔　，產品自無法　通。故兩地間信用之灌通，實繁榮內地經濟之要索，而負溝通內地信用者，又舍金融業　屬。當地之金融業，應充分利用信用證書，　如乙地購貨人向甲地採購商品，可至當地　行覓具保證，請發信用證書，途正常，原則　合，即塡發證書，由購貨人連同委託機關，接收信用證書以後，即向甲　之銀行乙地銀行人理人）證明，由甲地銀行負責承做押匯，或代收貨疑。如此則兩地間之信用，　以銀行保證而溝通，而產品，亦可以流通矣。</p>
<p>上列兩種方法，不僅可以促成內地產品之行銷，即金融業亦放欵有安全方法，可以充分扶助內地產業之發展。故內地金融不在金融業之擴充信明放欵與否，而在本身能否謀變方安全可以通　之方策，此又在內地工商業與金融業所共同　力者也。</p>
<p>上述三端，後就管見所及，且就金融業之立場而言。多數金融業中之有識者，亦早已深謀遠慮，考劃週詳。唯以我國幅員之大，天賦之厚，發展產業，决非舍通力合作全體一致而能達成功之境者。在我國經濟恐慌及世界經濟不景氣潮流之中，固不能責金融業獨任其艱，獨負其責，然領導工商，納入正軌，則吾人有不得不仰望金融界耳。（完）</p>

<h3>愛的爭奪</h3>
<p>— 蘇嬰</p>
<p>因為近來在學校里敎了幾點　書，才有和成羣的孩子們接近的機會。</p>
<p>對於孩子，一向都很生疏。因為書本上或者別人口頭上都把孩子們讚美得了不得，自己便也認定孩子們是純潔無瑕的超人的天使。但這回接觸了他們以後，却意外地感到失望。</p>
<p>固然，孩子們不是沒有惹人憐愛的地方。像他們那種任性的行動，任性的情感，都不是我們這些給虛偽支配着的人所敢作出來的。如果要說孩子們有所謂天眞，恐怕就在這「任性」上面罷。</p>
<p>在一班慣和和接近的孩子們中，有一個十來歲的女孩子。她那高高額頭，黑黑的大眼，和那筋肉堅靭的嘴唇，都表現出她很强的個性。在這羣孩子們中，她是項沉靜的一個。也許因為在這一點上和自己相近的緣故，我和她玩得特別親熱，對於別的孩子，就不免略略冷淡起來。這在別的孩子們自己是不會覺得的。然而終究起了爭端。</p>
<p>每逢她和我球着時，別的孩子自然也要參加的。她却一定不許，鼓起那筋肉堅觀靭的小嘴巴，推着人家叫「走開！走開！」不至達到目的不止。這種明顯的獨佔行為，引起了別的孩子對她一致的反感。加之，一遇有的孩子向我要銅板買東西時，她總是毫不留情地罵人「不要臉孔，討光生的銅板，」這自然也是容易惹人嫌惡的原因。後來，一些孩子便聯成一氣來反對她了。大家一致議决不許理她，而且公開地嘲笑她，奚落她，說她拍先生的馬屁，說她恃强欺人，有時大家一齊圍着她，學她的聲音，學她的動作，過了些時日，孩子們的包圍政策居然成功了，終於她再不跟我玩了，見了我的面就遠遠避開，有時就是拉也拉不住。這使我想起在家跟弟妹們玩時的情景。在他們，爭閭是時常的的，起因又往往是為了我。一個說：「二哥是我的，你沒有份！」別一個一定急得臉孔漲紅，大叫「二哥是我的！不是你的！」結果照例是揪打起來，非待做二哥的我來排解不可。我的老方法是「二哥是大家的，大家教都有份。」爭　雖然停止了，可是，從弟妹們的表情上看來，顯然還是不曾滿足，因為到底沒有確定二哥是誰的二哥。</p>
<p>為了爭一種事物的屬性相打起來，為了要獨佔而對別人加以排斥，為了妬視便取了嘲笑陷害的行為，這都是麽有觀念的表現，這現象，在成人的世界中，不消說是平常得好像吃飯一樣，而在孩子們的世界中，也這樣廣泛地在表現，確是很可慮的事。</p>
<p>孩子們的心，本來是潔白的，本來是沒有什麽成見的，成見的發生，是生活經騐的積累使然。在私有制度的社會里，當孩子們一有意識的時候，便由大人們不斷地把私有觀念傳授給他們了。最愚笨的孩子，也許會不曉得飯是白米煮成的，却絕不會不曉得某件東西是自己的，別人不能拿走這回事。生在這樣的社會里，受着這樣的敎養，說起來，是不能深怪孩子們的。要使孩子們能够眞正了解，眞正相愛，合理的社會生活是一個必要的先决的條件。</p>
<h3>避世者的洞穴</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>—極樂寺小記—</p>
<p>電車叮叮地從市中心向何益依淡的郊外馳去。檳榔嶼靜寂的街道滿撤着太陽的金光，而郊外零落地散佈着的別墅型小屋宇却圍植着綠林。「南國的花園」有她的嬌小玲瓏的姿態，而在電車的終點，從一家小茶舍的外面所看到的避世者們底極樂寺，也在太陽光下閃着金色的斑爛。</p>
<p>從山麓登上階層，山峯從上面高高地壓蓋下來。廣大的殿堂騰繞着香烟，木魚聲催人神經麻醉。客廳上懸掛着南洋中外聞人的像片，想見前些時那些初闢　荒的無名英雄們却是橫遭湮沒。檳榔嶼被築成了「南國的花園」，極樂寺成了避世者的隱地，而開闢草萊者前些時是死於毒蛇惡瘴，繼起者而今却不斷地遭受壓迫和驅逐！</p>
<p>極樂寺，現在是一個資本化了的淸將世界。據說用五百元可以買到終生的退隱；我們的閒情寄趣的士君子們應該來看這些和尚們所植的大盆鮮花，和紅色欄桿邊舒適的「宿舍」！還有，做為支持和保管者的方丈是從「八股」出身，他管着寺產，交接着政府官吏，英國紳士，和華僑「頭家」們；他的手下有着善操中·英國語和閩·粵各地方言的說客，有着佈置寺院的藝術家。一位大善士捐了一座寳塔，使檳榔嶼的全景被攝在塔尖；許多慈善家們放了一大堆大小龜兒，使小花園假假山前的小池邊添了許多遊人的脚跡。庭院雅潔而多鮮花，殿堂廣闊而漂亮。一個小和尚嘆息着「不景氣」的風已經開始吹到這個「極樂世界」，他們的心裏却不曾計算有一天恐怕「避世者」也會「無世可避。」</p>
<p>一道山泉從左邊的山巔上屈曲地滴流下來，泉聲潺潺地在沉靜的環境裏很覺悅耳。泉源給高大的枝叢蔭蔽了，在極樂寺的旁邊却匯成了幾個小池。後背的靑山高大地展佈着茂密的叢林，飛鳥在金亮的小池和森林上面急遽飛翔。前面的眼界展佈着檳榔嶼海峽，輪船不住地在噴着黑烟。整個的檳榔嶼花園利用極樂寺靠着山腰的支撐，造成假山的藝術式樣。而檳榔嶼竭力從馬來半島吸收來富翁，在小巧雅潔的密集的住宅區，安置下避世者的桃源，預備士大夫型下野和富家人謀財失敗時退休之用。</p>
<p>試看在唸經聲和木魚聲中的避世者，廿世紀的血腥可能向他們洗刷？而在將來，避世者洞穴可會隨南國的更新而重建！</p>
<h3>雨夜憶友</h3>
<p>— 方之中</p>
<p>趁夜雨喘氣的事餘暇，我披着件寒重的濕衣走進給世紀遺落的，連吼一聲也會揭去天蓋的屋子裏。</p>
<p>憂鬱底塵案上吸住一張白紙，白紙吸住我的視綫，翻個面：周君端甫於×月×日病歿於南京××醫院！</p>
<p>他死了！瑯璫底生活的鐵錘，粉碎了一個和善而又結實的生命！</p>
<p>悲哀織就了命運的網，讓暮烟深鎖住燕子磯頭，當水花濺着夜月時，我祈求他作最後一閃狂吼！</p>
<p>我記起—深深地記起他那脆弱的性格，控制了他那脆弱的生命，由於烈火燒焦了求生的意念，便無情地鞭策自已的軀體，可是鱗鱗底創傷，並沒補復生活的　漏。是誰戕害了他喲！</p>
<p>是細雨叩着芭蕉，一片凄冷浸透屋子的秋夜，我和他對着床諦聽空氣似乎在默唱讚美詩的時候，他俯下頭，也似乎在祈禱了。遼闊底人海，他捉不定一片實在那末地！他思維中原有幾分宗敎底雜質，於是責任成了他的直覺，倘若事實衝破他意識底範圍，他便一口口鮮紅的血吐出來了</p>
<p>可是連他自己也不知道這是初期肺結核！</p>
<p>四兩膏梁和一包五香豆，這就是我們同居亘五個月的離筵，且吃且喝，夜雨悄悄地帶去了時辰，直到醉意傾倒了我們的興奮，才各自睡去。翌晨，他便踏上陌生的覓食程途了。</p>
<p>這是四年前的事。四年中我們受了生活的刦掠，連信件也少來往，他縱然有時來到上海，也很少碰面機會，直到本年一個暑天的午後，為了一百度熱浪的冲擊，我打一條狹長凉幽的胡同里轉到另一條馬路時，在弄口，我碰着他了。他揮着手，柳條似的皺紋在他面上掃拂着，那是微笑，從眼角直垂到口邊，口唇連連翕動着。</p>
<p>「生活在你臉上刻下千萬條跡痕啊！」我慨嘆着。</p>
<p>他沒有聲音，但語意從滲出的氣息中我懂得。灰色的命運底網捉住了他，從他灼熟的手心，土灰的面孔，淋漓的痰結，我測定他的肺結核已到第三期的末梢了。</p>
<p>但病人怕聽自己的病的危機，便像一個醜婦怕瞧鏡子那樣諱忌，雖然我們又是兩三天歡聚，他肯德基短床，我肯德基地板對談着，但我們的話題只是別後的情景和人事的波浪，沒有談到他的病；他仍是拼着餘音健談着，得意時且暩暩地笑，情景和四年前一樣，但精神的距離却很遙遠了！</p>
<p>第三天天剛亮，我送他上江灣肺病療養院去，他精神抖擻地把一隻籐籃從電車上提到公共汽車站上，他阻止我進步了</p>
<p>「別去，很熱，一禮拜來瞧我一次；待我好時，我們可要快活地耍幾天」！</p>
<p>聖，瑪琍校里上課鐘響了，不知是催我上課，抑或敲着我們的永別，就在那兩析靑靑的梧桐底下，匆匆地握了一把最後的手！</p>
<p>不知何時他又回到了南京，更不知何時魔鬼伸出了鐵爪，當我雙手顫跳地捧起那方印着「訃」字的白紙時，頓把簌簌的淸淚作了祭酒！</p>
<h3>懷鄕病者的心酸</h3>
<p>— 何圭人</p>
<p>一眼看到那帶有封建意味的簇新的春聯，又使我想着古老的家鄕及年老的父親。秀才而年老無事的父親，他每年都歡喜自製春聯；往往在大年夜的前幾天，終日摩撫字彙，終日吟詠聯語。門聯是規定用年庚字嵌起頭的，堂聯則切合他老人家自己的身份，有時也發點牢騷；不過他是痛恨俗習的，十幾年來的春聯，我始終沒有看到過祝福祈祥的句子。</p>
<p>那是大前年里父親是五十歲了，頭上已滿長了莖莖的白髮，他改了陸放翁的兩句詩，寫成一副堂聯：「白髪無憑傷朋輩，靑燈有味課兒曹。」由這副對中，也可以體味出我的父親平日對於兒輩敎育的重視。父親敎我們是很認眞的，國學；日文，非至成背不休，每夜必盡油一盞，他自己亦兀坐案頭，逐字句講解，這樣的啟蒙的工作，消磨了父親的十幾年的歲月，所以在這兩句聯語里，頗能道出他老人的心境。這聯是由父親親手寫好，親手貼上案頭的木柱。</p>
<p>就是這一年開始，我是出來流浪了，天南地北，一直到如今還沒有回過家鄕；當此「廢曆」新年剛過的時候，想起家鄕間的春聯想起父親昔日的聯語，在無可奈何里，心頭兜然浮上了一陣懷鄕病者的凄然的心酸。</p>

<h3>再談「胡適之體」</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>同是一樣白操心，同是一樣白說話，我們關於「胡適之體」的討論。你看詩經，楚辭，是誰先規定了形式，誰先限制了內容，然後創作出來的呢？</p>
<p>今日（一月十七日）又看到任鈞先生和子模先生在文藝週刋上發表的文章，都有誤會我的地方，逼我有個答覆，實在不大高興。因為恰恰遇著舊歷小除夕，年關緊逼，沒有閒情做文章，請原諒這個。</p>
<p>「胡適之體」是我在「蓪廬詩話」裏先後列舉許多新詩體式中的一種，任鈞先生旣說我「特別指出」，子模先生又說我「特別提出來」，不知道他們是說謊呢？還是沒有看完那十段詩話就早下判斷，早作結論呢？倘若必要一口咬定我有「特別指出」或「特別提出來的詩體，那就只有「諷刺詩」。我在這一段詩話裏談到楊騷先生的啤酒頌一詩，說是「好像頹唐的哀鳴，實在憤怒的調子；好像對人生厭倦，實在抱求生熱望。」接下再說「我以為從為個人的呼號到為社會的吶喊，這是詩人前進的一條大路。用着深摯高妙的筆法，暴露現實，針砭現實，朋理想更有熱情的諷刺詩，應該是目前詩壇上獨步的一種詩體，惜乎還不曾見到以此成家的詩人。」在新詩許多路中指出這是「前進的一條大路」，又說走這條路的詩人可以「獨步」在目前的詩壇上，這倒有點像是「特別指出」或「特別提出來」同時也就確實含有鼓動人或「勸人」的意思，倘若說這個眞應該負「嚴重點」的責任，我並不躲閃。倘若我的言責並不怎樣「嚴重」，故意曲解，確認單誇張，那就是別有心腸了。</p>
<p>我自己作過許多運用口語的新詩，並不曾想學「胡適之體」，除了最近我在「論語」新年號發表的「飛行小咒」故意開玩笑以外。但是這首詩我敢担保不像子模先生說的「飛行小贊」那樣，在內容上是「有閒階級的閒適的意態之表現」，雖說在形式上似乎也和「飛行小贊」差不多。任鈞先生第一次說我「不免有故意勸人開倒車之嫌」，第二次又說「陳先生始終認胡適之體是一條新路，要勸人家去走。」不知道我曾勸了誰人，其實我連自己也不曾那樣做。我不過承認在許多路之中可以有那麽一條路，在許多體式之中可以那麽一體，誰走不走那條路，誰用不用那種詩體，都聽誰的使。我並不曾說，這是新詩唯一的路，這是唯一的新詩體式。在我提出這個之後，我就料到怕有人誤會，所以接着就鄭重聲明一句說，「自然不是說，這是唯一的路。」在我已經寫出的十幾段詩話裏，就新詩的形式上說，指出新詩可走的路很多，儘可任人自由選擇，還可任人自由開創，我不曾妄想統制詩壇。到羅馬去的路不止一條，不妨殊塗而歸，我總這麽想。在我這樣的見地上，提出「胡適之體」承認牠是許多新詩體式中的一種，我想其結果未必會如任鈞先生所說：「這不但一筆勾消了十幾年來慘淡經營的新詩運動所得的成果，而且說得嚴重點，還不免有故意勸人開倒車之嫌。」任鈞先生偏偏這麽說，不知道他有什麽用意。</p>
<p>綜看任鈞子模伯韓三位前後四篇文章，說到關於新詩內容的意見，關於內容和形式怎樣聯繫的意見，和我並沒有什麽衝突。他們指摘我的地方只是關於新詩的形式之一各上，即是「從舊詩舊詞蛻化出來的胡適之體」，我承認在新詩許多體式中不妨有此一種，讓牠存在，任鈞子模兩位就根本否認。伯韓却相當的承認我那一說，可是附有條件，我也可以相當的承認他提出的那幾個條件，我和他算是沒有爭論了。我不會做「魔的辯護者」，但我對於任鈞子模兩位却還有應該答辯的地方，這次答辯完了，我也就想從此不談「胡適之體」了。</p>
<p>我「所以」承認「從舊詩舊詞蛻化出來的胡適之體」不妨作為新詩的一體，原來的理由，只說「我以為前人配合了中國固有的語言文字的懮點而創造出來的詩詞謠曲那許多韵文體式，還是可以供我們新詩人自由運用的，固然不可死死拘守那些體式的那些規律，同時也無妨創造新的體式，採取外國詩歌的體式。」至今我還是以為這些話沒有犯什麽「嚴重」的大錯誤，儘管你怎麽去分析，只要你肯用你淸晰的頭腦，老實說，漢文不廢，古書不燒，號為「文學遺產」的東西有人要接受，那末，從來詩歌的體式，從來詩歌創作的方法或技巧，總有一些要影響於後來的詩人。我在我們「反帝」「反封建」的偉大的政治的創作沒有完成的時候，並償提早主張「接受文學遺產」，像拉狄克前年在作家大會的演辭裏所說的一樣：「我們的文學發現了偉大的創作的道路。這偉大的創作的大路立脚於優秀的的傳統上」。但有沿着這種「具有進步性的傳統的發展下來的東西，多少要帶到傳統的影響，還看得出歷史的蛻化，並不是完全要不得。這裏要注意！我說「影響」不是「模倣」，「蛻化」不是「因襲」。我說「從舊詩舊詞蛻化出來的」一種詩體，「蛻化」兩字的意思原來不過如此，倘若你還嫌「蛻化」兩字太文，或者有什麽不妥，那就改說「進化」也可以。雖說胡適之不是「我的朋友」，我不會阿其所好，替他張目，誰都可以放心。只因我說到從舊詩舊詞蛻化出來的新詩體，順便標上一個「胡適之體」，惹出許多麻煩，這是我失檢點的地方。為什麽不拿魯迅先生「擬古的打油詩」「我的失戀」那首詩作例呢？便宜學戲台裏喝彩，拿我自己近作「飛行小咒」「水災頌一類的詩作例，也許不嚴重成的問題，須一筆勾消了十幾年來慘淡經營的新詩運動的成果」的重大責任。記得我曾恭和周作人先生的「五十自壽詩」，對於他用舊詩體，尤其是對於他用不甚適宜的思想作內容，不免夫　。一個靑年作家拿我這首打算丟棄的詩　在他的「人間何世」一文裏，刋在「自由談」上，曾引起　於「人間世」，對於周先生的一場論戰。說也好笑！如今報　落在在我身上，我對於　舊詩舊詞的蛻化出來的詩體給他一角位置，我　　了「勸人聞倒車之嫌」，也遭「圍勦」一次。我想想念一種「傳動論」，「半是　家」的周作人先生，說不定要暗中鼓　，咒我活該了啦！</p>
<p>好，就此帶　了罷，我不想　　　　了。</p>
<h3>藝術的特質和本質</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>藝術的描寫現實表現現實，不能不通過感性的形象。藝術的表現方法，並非用一般的，抽象的手段，而是用個別的具體的手段。</p>
<p>因此，藝術的特質，是存在其表現方法上，存在其藝術的形式上的。</p>
<p>忽視了藝術的這一特質，則創作上表現出「公式化的作品」理論上表現出「政府化的評比」</p>
<p>「現實主義的文學，是在可視的現實的中發現眞理與理想，而以可視的現實的姿態去表現它的文學。」（小　甚二）</p>
<p>「可視的現實」，應該理解為現實發展中的現實的可能性；「現實的姿態」，應該理解為表現現實的必然的本質的，偶然的具象的東西。—在這樣的解釋上，上面那個定義，要吧作為我們的現實主義文學的定義。</p>
<p>這這義包含着兩個主要的契機（Momeut）：第一，我們要表現什麽東西？回答是—「在現實發展的可能性上表現實」；第二，我們要怎樣表現？回答是—「在感性的形象上表現現實」。</p>
<p>很淸楚地，這兩個契機，第一個藝術的本質；第二個是藝術的特質。</p>
<p>把藝術的本質混為藝術的特質，是機械主義，公式主義；把藝術的特質混為藝術的本質，是經騐主義，形式主義。</p>
<p>機械主義者和公式主義者，帶着一副偽造的「必然」的眼鏡，這眼鏡是用「本質」造成的。然而，他因此也就看不到現實，表現不出現實。</p>
<p>經騐主義者和形式主義者，帶着一副偽造的「偶然」的眼鏡，這眼鏡是用「現象」造成的。然而，他因此也就看不到現實，再現不出現實。</p>
<p>現實—本質和現象的矛盾並統一，必然和偶然的矛盾並統一。</p>
<p>本質再現在現象裏，但單獨的現象並不能在完整的意義上表現本質；必然再現在偶然裏，但單獨的偶然並不能在完整的意義上表現必然。這是說，應該在本質的發展過程上來處理現象，應該在必然的發展過程上來處理偶然。</p>
<p>但這不是會發生「主題的一致性」麽？</p>
<p>高爾基的全作品裏，都是些小市民，浮浪漢，勞力者；一句話說，都是些「下層階級」的人物。他沒有以托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平」那樣的題材，或像辛克萊的「煤油」那樣的題材—所謂「上層階級」的題材！去做主題。杜斯退夫斯基的全作品裏，也都是小市民下層的人物。</p>
<p>為什麽高爾基和杜斯退夫斯的作品，沒有發生過「主題的一致性」？相反地，高爾基由這些「下層階級」創造出內容豐富的「史詩」；杜斯退夫斯基的主題的展開，總是出人意外地迅速奇突！</p>
<p>因為高爾基是從「我的大學」中畢業的，而杜斯退夫斯基呢，他也經騐着作品裏的人物的生活。他們把握到藝術的本質和藝術的特質，他們把握到藝術的認識方法和藝術的表現方法。雖然杜斯退夫斯基的世界觀妨害了他的現實上，盛開了他們的藝術的燦爛之花的。</p>
<p>「主題的一致性」是由於作家的生活經騐（認識的深度）或藝術修養（技術的高度）的缺乏；也就是說，他們沒有在統一上去把握藝術的本質和特質。</p>
<p>「我們稱他們為頹廢的作家，並非說喬伊斯，普勞斯特等不是偉大的作家，恰恰相反，因為這種頹廢本身也具有他的積極性的，像喬伊斯等，在分析的聰明與敏感上，他們都到達了前些任時期都難以比並的高度。…第一種文化的落日的餘暉，較之它的任何一切，有時候是更為可愛的。」</p>
<p>「可愛」的問題暫且擱起，但要解釋這種現象，說明「這些近代的偉大作家的作品裏的特質，」除了「現存的文化又正在急遽地　落着」這原因—這應被歸結到社會發展的本質的原因上—外，不是應該從他們的藝術的本質和特質的矛盾上去說明，才能顯出其特質麽？他們的藝術，是「奇特的，怪異的，」這就是說，他們藝術的本質，正是現實發展的本質的反對物，然而他們却部分地把握到藝術的特質，即技術。但這技術可以遺留給我們的，實在少得可憐。為什麽呢？因為他們太都耽醉在「言語的魔術裏，和瑣屑的經騐主義的泥沼裏。</p>
<p>那末，「我們應不應當跟這些有頹廢傾向的作家們學習呢？」我想也是可以的。「我看過無數的壞書，壞書也給了益處」（高爾基。）但我也想，這並不是我們現在的主要的對象。為什麽呢？請再引高爾基的話：「最喜歡的是看那些生活在和自己一樣的環境中的人們的事情。」作品所現的環境和人物，都是作者所經騐或觀察過的，喜歡作品裏的人物事件，就是表示這讀者和那作者之間，有着某種境遇上的因而是意識上的共通性。站在這種共通性之上，我們學習着那些過去的大作家怎樣地在顯現藝術的特質。因為所謂意識上的共通性，並不是說我們的意識跟過去那些大作家完全一樣，而是意味着那種作家的意識中，有若干要素是被包含在我們的意識的發展過程裏的。所以我們不是在學習他們的思想意識，我們是在批判他們的思想意識；甚至也許還要攻擊他們的思想意識。我們要學習他們製造藝術的特質的技術，以及怎麽使這藝術的特質和其藝術的本質統一起來。</p>
<p>本質是一般的，普遍的；特質是特殊的，個別的。我們要把握到正確的藝術的本質，應該在現實中，去反映現實的哲學，科學，藝術中去把握，對於那種並沒有完整的世界觀—沒有完整的認識方法的藝術，我們是站在某種它們和我們的共通點上，去接近那藝術的特質的。</p>
<p>但是在這裏也得注意，所謂藝術的特質，也離不了作家所處的社會集團的决定。我們之接近這藝術的特質，還是要通過我們的世界觀的三稜鏡的反射的作用的。不然的話，就是奴隸的模倣，不能使藝術的本質和特質統一，不能創造新的藝術形式。</p>

<h3>關於面麗的兩封來信</h3>
<p>（一）治愈少女之雀斑</p>
<p>編者先生。我是一個求學時代的少女。不在功課學業上求智慧。却去用心在美容方面。說來很覺慚愧。但愛美觀念。人皆有之。何况我們女子。我。在十一二歲。臉上不幸就生了雀斑。初尙隱隱的的。四五年內。漸見其多。我爲了這一點。不知費過多少心思。耗過多少金錢。然而所得到的結果。還是失望。前兩個月。在報上看見一種『面麗』。說是能去除雀斑。我也不放在心上。因爲市上除斑的化妝藥品。實在太多了。究其竟何嘗有一靈效。後來同學中也有去買來嘗試的。據說。居然十分有效。目前的事實。這眞使我不能不信了。就照樣去買了一瓶。天天像雪花膏這樣的搽着。一瓶之後。就覺斑點淡了許多。後來第二瓶繼續搽着不到半瓶。面上的雀斑。竟已完全無形消滅了。世有靈藥。人每交臂失之。所以特地記述我治療雀斑的經過。請先生載於貴刊一角。算是貢獻給同胞姊妹們。　　殷麗涓上</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談談國防戲劇</h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>國防戲劇之提出，正跟國防文學一樣，是配合着整個救亡運動和當前底客二觀形勢，適應着事實上底急切的需要而產生的。在國家和民族正陷在水深火熱之中，我們底民族敵人正玩弄着一慕新把戲，演唱着獨佔中國的所謂「提携』與「和平』的時候，我們要緊急地鞏固我國的國防，把我們的敵人攆出中國去，消滅了一切賣國的漢奸，……這表現于羣衆的行動上是整個如火如茶的救亡運動，無論是什麼階級，什麼派別，……都一致在這個目標之下團結起來，眞正的共赴國難。這表現之於作爲戰鬥的武器之一的戲劇和文學上，是國防戲劇與國防文學之建設。</p>
<p>關於國防戲劇之建設，首先應該提到的是國防戲劇的內容，和牠底主要的任務。我們不可忽視國防戲劇的特殊性，但是我們也不能因之而把牠孤立起來，恰恰相反，國防戲劇是跟一般現實的戲劇一樣，相互之間是有着極緊密的聯系的。它不過是在特殊的情况底下所產生的一種新的戲劇而已。因此，我們不能把它和一般戲劇分離開來，而要把它與一般戲劇構成一個完整的關係。我們而且要盡量發揮它的特殊性，使它成為救亡運動底推動力而膨大起來。只有這</p>
<p>我們知道適應中國當前的環境，是需要鞏固國防底最宏大的戰鬥力，這戰鬥力不止是靠恃着軍事的力量，而且受有廣大的大衆的協助　擁護，和直接參加，要有整個勇敢的戰鬥的民族底自覺，耍有保衛國家領土完整和自己底民族的獨立與解放底愛國的政府。…國防戲劇最主要的任務，也就應該配合着當前的客觀需要，而加以决定。因之，它底內容也就應該是和它底任務相一致的。</p>
<p>卽管是從歷史上，從目前由於敵人的侵略而造成的事變，或者更從別的民族解放鬥爭的敎訓上（象阿比西尼亞之抗意和埃及之反英…等，）我們都可以採子的封建性地狹的愛國主義的戲劇，而是表現出偉大的國防鞏衛力的戲劇！</p>
<p>在表現的方法上，我們提議不論派別和形式的戲——京劇，粵劇話劇三都在這目標之下聯合起來，用牠們自己所特具的力量，特殊的表現方法，作有力的表現。只要集中在這唯一的和共同的觀點之中，什麼形式都可以成爲國防戲劇的形式……因此，我們要求，不願做亡國奴，和非漢奸的各種戲劇集團，戲劇家們，一致接受國防戲劇底緊念的建議。</p>
<h3>飢餓</h3>
<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>當一羣活潑潑充滿了生活力的孩子，被下課鈴底可噹的聲響送走了的時候，我好像失掉了和件什麼可寳貴的東西一樣的有些悵悵！同時這潦闊的院落也寂靜下來，像遇見了强敵而窒息着的野獸，一樣的蜷伏著，不敢有一絲的蠢動：這院落就要這樣毫無生氣的睡下去了，一直耍等到第二天的早上，再用孩子們的生之合唱的歌聲來把它喚醒！那，我也就得到了溫暖，我好像返回到兒童時代一樣地充滿了生之慾望，我高歌，我歡唱，我重新跳入了孩子的隊伍……我盼望看明天能够早點到來。</p>
<p>我坐在敎員寢室里的書桌旁邊遐想着些別的事情，但我總忘不掉對於孩子們的渴慕。</p>
<p>點著了香烟，讓香烟帶走了我的疲倦吧！</p>
<p>「先生！——」</p>
<p>這突然的聲音使我嚇得一跳，它是那樣的不熟習，暗啞的聲音還加着胆怯的抖動，我回過頭來向他望着時，他是那樣地莫之所措的張大了眼睛向我點了點頭，像是呌我原諒他的冒失似的。</p>
<p>他的莫三十幾歲的年紀，鬍鬚像鋼針一樣的伸出着，他有一副强健的體格，高大的身材，在臉上稍稍帶有一些兒蒼白，藍褸而單薄的衣衫制止不住他因寒而抖戰的肉體，但他仍是竭力的鎭定看自己，使自己像常人一樣的鎭靜。</p>
<p>「先生！——這聲此上一聲更大了一點，他是要喚起我的注意了」人餓了是得要吃飯的嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，」我回答他，我知道這又是被困于飢寒的一個可憐者了。</p>
<p>「沒有飯吃怎麼辦呢？」他又加重了他的聲音緊了一步的向我發問了，這眞有些使我爲難，我要怎樣回答他呢？他又接着說：我是想盡了方法去找事做，終久是找不到的呵！</p>
<p>他那樣的充滿了情感的語調，一直打穿了我的心，這是多麼一個嚴重的問題呵，在我眼前我所感到的己不是一個他，而變成了幾千幾萬的無工作無飯吃一的無數的他了！</p>
<p>「先生！」——先生！我還有一個老婆和兩個六七歲的孩子哪！他們有什麼罪過呵？</p>
<p>孩子，孩子，天眞活潑的孩子，噢！我不敢再想了，我只看見他張大了一雙忿怒的眼，握緊了大的拳頭，他簡直是一隻暴怒的野獸了！我感到了自己的渺小，我不能答覆他所問的呵！</p>
<p>「先生！」我們已經半個星期沒吃一點可以飽肚子的東西了——</p>
<p>「你要我帮助你一點嗎？」</p>
<p>「不！先生，你帮助我一時能帮助我永久嗎？你能帮助上千上萬的像我這樣的人嗎？先生你吿許我：要是爲了飢餓而做出犯法的事，這也應該算犯罪嗎？</p>
<p>「不！」我被他征服了，我用上力氣發出給他同樣强而有力的聲調來，「爲了活命，是不犯罪的。」</p>
<p>「好！先生，你說的對，謝謝你，」說着他又點了點頭，在臉上閃出了希望的光亮，他邁着沈着而有力的步子，一會便響出了寢室，嚮出了寂寞的院落。</p>
<p>我懷念着他，我更懷念着他底兩個六七歲的孩子。</p>
<p>是一個星期天的上午，我行在鎭裏的大馬路上，奇怪的很，每個人都在伸長了勃子向西望着，像等待着什麼奇蹟一樣，我懷着一個疑團向前走着，不多遠一簇人已經像潮頭一樣的滾來了，縣兵們弓上弦，刀出鞘的　着一個犯人，那犯人的面貌很熟習，當他在我旁行過、時，他向我點了點頭，呵！他的臉是那樣的蒼白，我記起了，我實在是認識他，一星期以前他還給我有一决的會談呢</p>
<p>街上的人紛紛的議論着：他還有一個老婆兩個孩子哩！他是很窮的，狗急了跳牆，他沒有辦法，他去搶飯店裏的東西吃，人家來逮他，他把人家一鎚子打死了……</p>
<p>不就是他嗎？我後悔！是我害了他嗎？但我想我的話是對的。</p>

<h3>生活底反正</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>一個夏天，我從山東底省城坐車到北平去。一路上都很平安，在正陽門車站沒經過檢査就過去了。那時的心情是說不出的愉快。因爲我討厭那些麻煩。</p>
<p>由一部洋車把我拖住，往西城的一家公寓里去。那是住着一位只見過一决面的朋友底朋友。我就預備和這樣的一位先生住在一起。抬頭望望天，眞美，我從來沒有見過這樣美的天空。以前我看過愛羅先珂的文章，他是一個瞎子，他渴望着光明，那時，他住在北京，我想如果他知道北平的天空是那樣美，他一定會更加苦悶的。可是在我到北平的第二天，就落起雨來了。一落雨，天上全給濃密的黑色的雲塊蔽着，美麗的，一明朗的天空見不到了，就像把我底眼睛迷住似的。我喊着無聊了。</p>
<p>「眞無聊，媽媽的！」</p>
<p>院子裏一在一在的全是水。雨點輕一陣緊一陣地往下落。</p>
<p>每個房子裏全住滿了人，下雨天又都不出去。有的正打牌，有的正拉胡琴，問或有雅片烟底香味和着念英文的女孩子底聲音傳過來。北平人或久住北平的人會哼幾句，唱兩齣，是不稀罕的；大學生們吸雅片却是我沒聽到過的。</p>
<p>我底朋友，是一個非常精明的人物。長得也很漂亮。雖然生活窮苦得要命，還快活得跟別人一樣。他是一個樂觀的傢伙。我就問他：</p>
<p>「很多人抽大烟嗎？你聞聞……香哩！」</p>
<p>「很多。在北平的大學生，有的老婆孩子都帶來；大烟是常事。」他當平常事向我說，我很想到興味；「遺少們太多了！」</p>
<p>有一决，他就指給我一個人看：臉子白白的，頭髮光光的，嘴唇有點蒼白</p>
<p>「這傢伙什麽都幹，抽大烟更不用說了！沒上過課。」</p>
<p>又一天，他吿訴我：有一個同鄕人，他成天打牌；和敎授們打，也和同學打，技術非常好，兩年多了，學費都是從敎授手裏贏來的。他還把這位同鄉介紹給我，是一個爲人，有些妞妮，像一個女孩子的人，手白生生的，嘴唇像塗着口紅，有時寫一點美麗的字句堆積成的文章，哼幾句他自己也莫明其妙的小詩，在北平的小報上發表一下，拿一點微薄的稿費。</p>
<p>還有一些人，就是戲迷：當了衣服也去看戲。喜峯口，古北口戰爭多麽緊張的時候，他們就沒有忘記去捧他們愛好的角色。好像國家大事全有人來管，他們是不多過問的。</p>
<p>「他們嫖不嫖呢？」我見朋友忘記吿訴我關於這一點的事情，就問他道。</p>
<p>他好像怪我多問似的說：「這還能少了？有些人二十多歲了，在北平一住就是三五年；沒有老婆不去嫖去那裏？」並且呌我回想一下，有一决我們到中山公園去玩的時候，曾經看到很多成對的男女，「那些男女有的是愛人，夫婦，有的就是妓女，學生，敎授！</p>
<p>我好像被人帶進一個和我底生活思想絕不相同的地方來了，這些東西我都不威興味，都不會。將來在這樣的人羣里生活怎麽辦呢？可是這位朋友已經過了兩三年了。別人也過了無數的幾月了。我想，他一定也是這樣過的吧：我問他：你呢？」</p>
<p>「我？」他冷冷地笑了一笑，「我沒資格：他媽的窮就把我底一切權利都剝削了，我不能常到公園去，不能看戲去，不能玩女人，就是打牌人家看著我沒錢輸也不高興跟我來。別的，更不好說了。你過幾天就知道，這里的生活也是有興味，也是無聊的。」</p>
<p>「那麽，你每天怎樣呢？那些不上學的呢？」</p>
<p>「我只是到學校里或者　書館里去。有些人，他們就沒有家，連公腐都不住。隨便找個朋友家里睡睡覺，早晨起來，一早的跑出去，國立圖書館你知道吧？到那里，洗洗臉，大大便，喝喝水，翻過矮石欄干就是北海公園，或者就在圖書館里散散步，再進去看報報，看看雜誌，讀書，寫文章，翻譯文章，隨你底意，一直到晚上閉門！」</p>
<p>「吃飯呢？不是得找地方嗎？」</p>
<p>「那還不好找？學校附近很多很多的哩。而且可以欠賬。」</p>
<p>嘆息的聲調說：「有些人才苦呢，他們簡直是成日被飢寒交迫着，冬天北平又特別冷，只能跑進圖書館里去！」」他底眼睛靈活地轉動着。淚珠濕潤了他底眼角，好像要哭了。因而，我不好再問他什麼。也許是由於他底生活把他壓得太緊了，遇到一個比較有關係的同鄕訴一下苦况的時侯，心情太悲哀了吧。我只好說：這種生活倒有味的！」</p>
<p>「可不，」他說：「窮苦是會使人健康的。在窮苦的熔爐里，也不知道煆煉出多少人，他們底骨頭成了鐵的，心成了鋼的了，任何人不能把他折服的！也只有這樣的人能够幹出點事情來。你聽，牌桌又拉開了，胡琴也拉起了…可是一遇　　鬼子底飛機來幾趟，就嚇壞了！」、</p>
<p>同時還有鴉片烟的香味傳過來。</p>
<h3>棄瓶</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>夜裏，燈光下，我就會看見它，歲月是很渺遠了，從來沒有聽見它對我說過一句話。我也從來沒有施給它一點溫情。它老是擺出一副沉默的嘴臉，張起深藍轉到黑色的小口，像有所期待，———也許是無邊的憂悒吧——有一個熟悉的而又是貪婪的東西，挿進它的小口去；是的，這把貪婪的東西，是捻在我手裏的筆了。到現在，我纔發覺出我的自私的慾念原來如此殘酷，從不加一點思索和考慮，支使着手裏的筆頭，從它深藍轉到黑色的小口裏蘸取去大量的資源，作成一點一滴的生活的點綴。我不會慚愧嗎？對於這夜夜相守寂寞的侶伴，現在已給我犧牲在自私的慾念之下了。</p>
<p>誰能保蹬它以後的命運呢？是將永遠被棄於　埃封積的暗角了。而我也只能以一個慚愧，聲太息，——將見這凌亂的樓面，又有一個步它命運的新侶伴，在遠長的歲月之中，夜夜厮守寂寞哩。</p>

<h3>Border Conflicts Erupt Again in Mongolia, Japan-Russia Situation Becomes More Sinister, Fierce Fighting Occurs Near Beierchi, Japanese Side Claims Russian Aircraft Dropped Bombs in Our Territory</h3>
<p>Changchun, A conflict occurred at the Olkhodoga guard post south of Beierchi yesterday morning. Eight people were killed on each side, the Japanese and Mongolian sides. The relationship between Mongolia and "Manchukuo" has become increasingly strained as a result. Yesterday, 200 Outer Mongolian soldiers crossed the border and occupied the guard post, encountering a mixed Japanese-"Manchukuo" team inspecting the border area near Beierchi. The two sides exchanged fire, resulting in fierce fighting for eight hours. The Mongolian soldiers were eventually driven back, and the guard post was recaptured by Japanese-"Manchukuo" soldiers. During the battle, two Outer Mongolian bombers appeared, although they dropped several bombs, there was no damage. The Mongolian side suffered many casualties, but only eight corpses were found. The Mongolian side abandoned a field gun, a machine gun, and eight tents before retreating. (13th Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo, The situation on the Mongolian-Manchu border has become increasingly dire as a result of continued border conflicts and the breakdown of the Russo-Japanese-"Manchukuo" three-party conference. The most recent conflict occurred yesterday morning. According to a communiqué issued by the Kwantung Army, a mixed Japanese-"Manchukuo" force, ordered to inspect the border near Beierchi on the Mongolian border, encountered 200 Outer Mongolian soldiers south of Beierchi. The two sides fought fiercely, and the Mongolian soldiers were defeated. The Japanese soldiers then occupied Olkhodoga. Eight Mongolian soldiers, one Japanese lieutenant, two non-commissioned officers, and five Japanese soldiers were killed in the battle. One Japanese captain, three Japanese soldiers, and seven "Manchukuo" soldiers were wounded. According to a dispatch from the Asahi Shimbun's Harer reporter, when the two sides were fighting, two Soviet Russian aircraft bombed the Japanese soldiers in the sky, but there were no casualties. Shortly after the communiqué was released, Ohashi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the "Manchukuo" government, returned to Changchun from Harbin, saying that his final meeting with Soviet Russian Consul General to Harbin, Slaveski, lasted for eight hours, but the meeting ended in complete failure. Ohashi denounced the Soviet Russian government for disregarding international justice and repeatedly using conspiracies to disrupt the peace and order of "Manchukuo," and said that there was no room for continued negotiations because Soviet Russia had repeatedly made irresponsible remarks. "Manchukuo" would be forced to pursue its own policies of defending peace and order, but the final decision would depend on the Soviet Russian government's final response to "Manchukuo's" protest. (13th Reuters)</p>
<p>Changchun, According to a telegram received by a certain agency at 8:00 PM on the 12th, after the joint forces of Japan and "Manchukuo" set out for the border, 100 Outer Mongolian soldiers were discovered occupying the "Manchukuo" border monitoring post in Orkhodoga in the southwest of Lake Beier on the 12th. A fierce battle began immediately, and the monitoring post was recaptured after several hours. (13th Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Changchun, A major conflict occurred between Outer Mongolian soldiers and the Japanese-Manchu army on the morning of the 12th. After the Outer Mongolian army was defeated, two light bombers flew out with the aim of revenge, flew to the territory of "Manchukuo" and dropped several bombs. Fortunately, there was no damage of any kind, but the use of military aircraft in border disputes was the first instance. (13th Electric News)</p>
<p>Changchun, The "Manchukuo" government has decided to lodge a strong protest with the Outer Mongolian government over the Outer Mongolian army's occupation of the Orkhodoga monitoring post. The Kwantung Army authorities, in view of the Outer Mongolian army's mobilization of field guns, machine guns, and bombers to cross the border and issue challenges, have decided on a policy of actively expelling Outer Mongolian troops within its borders. (13th Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Changchun, The "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement regarding the Outer Mongolian bomber's bombing of the Japanese-Manchu army in Olkhodoga, stating that this incident differs in nature from previous border conflict incidents. The Outer Mongolian army's attack on the Japanese-Manchu army with bombers is a serious act of challenge that is tantamount to a declaration of war. The Manchu government lodges a strong protest with Outer Mongolia and will take effective measures at the same time. (13th Allied News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hirota Proposes to Russia to Establish an Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>To Handle the Jinchanggou Incident</p>
<p>Tokyo, Regarding the Jinchanggou conflict between Japanese-"Manchukuo" and Soviet troops, countermeasures were carefully discussed by the Three Provinces Council based on on-the-ground reports. The Japanese-"Manchukuo" side believes that there was no illegal border crossing, while the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to Ambassador Ota regarding the case. The Japanese side naturally ignored it. Foreign Minister Hirota instructed Ambassador Ota on the 13th to clearly state the above situation and to clarify the unreasonableness of the Soviet protest. Taking advantage of this opportunity, fearing that the views of Japan and the Soviet Union on this case would not be consistent and the issue would be prolonged, it actively began the second step of work, proposing that Japan, "Manchukuo," and the Soviet Union establish an on-site mixed investigation committee to promote Soviet consideration. This is a major proposal to resolve the border disputes between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union, and all parties are paying close attention to how the Soviet Union will respond. The contents of its instructions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese-"Manchukuo" soldiers in Jinchanggou did not illegally cross the border. After conducting an on-site investigation of the conflict, it was discovered that the location of the fighting was clearly "Manchukuo" territory. Therefore, the Japanese government believes that the Soviet protest is unreasonable and will not accept it. As for the Soviet government's assistance to "Manchukuo" military deserters and the joint actions of the Red Army, illegally crossing the border within the territory of "Manchukuo" and attacking Japanese-Manchu troops, we will file a serious protest against this fact. The right to speak on all of the above illegal actions of the Soviet Union in the future must be reserved. If the Soviet government does not recognize the fair and clear on-site investigation by the Japanese side and does not withdraw its unreasonable protest, it is feared that the Jinchanggou incident will block the path to its resolution. Therefore, at this time, the Japanese government proposes to the Soviet government, from the perspective of establishing peace in East Asia, to resolve the case by establishing a Japanese-"Manchukuo"-Soviet on-site mixed investigation committee to handle it.

<h3>Under the Threat of Japan and Germany, the Soviet Union Enriches its Military Equipment</h3>
<p>Standing Army Increased to 1.3 Million</p>
<p>The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun stated that since the breakdown of the disarmament conference, the effectiveness of the Washington and London treaties has also disappeared. At the same time, the Pacific defense restriction clauses in the accompanying treaties will also be abolished this year. The Army authorities believe that the British and American sides are expanding Pacific defense facilities starting next year, so Japan cannot allow itself to remain silent. However, Japan is unwilling to provoke Britain and the United States, but pays great attention to Soviet Russia. The current situation of Soviet Russia is being investigated from the standpoint of joint defense by Japan and Manchukuo as follows: Soviet Deputy Defense Commissar Tukhachevsky, in view of the military budget of 14.8 billion yuan submitted to the Central Executive Committee last month to defend against the threats of the eastern and western borders of Japan and Germany, and with Japan as the target, is enriching the military equipment in the Far East. The new establishment of the Far East military industrial zone, the evolution of the double-tracking of the Siberian Railway, the distribution of 250,000 Far East troops in the 5,000-kilometer zone, preparation for the encirclement of Manchuria immediately after the outbreak of war, and the possession of 800 long-range heavy bombers and 650 tanks, the permanent establishment of various weapons factories, and the completion of chemical warfare facilities, and the construction of solid positions and countless permanent garrison camps in the Soviet-Manchu border area, the enrichment of its military equipment is amazing. Japan's standing army is less than 80,000, and the Manchurian army is only enough to maintain security. Taken together, the Soviet Union's strengthening of its offensive posture against Japan and Manchukuo cannot be ignored. Therefore, the strengthening of Japan's military strength against Russia can no longer be delayed.</p>
<p>Harbin, Soviet Military Commission Deputy Commissar Haduchevsky recently declared to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party that the number of troops in the Soviet Russian army has now increased to 1.3 million, making it the largest standing army in the world. It has 101 standing divisions, and another 13 million civilians have undergone military training and can perform various national defense tasks. (13th China United Press)</p>

<h3>Ukraine Willing to Support the Soviet Union</h3>

<p>Moscow – The Izvestia newspaper here today published a letter from Lubchenko, Chairman of the Ukrainian People's Committee, stating that "We should warn countries that use force to invade territory, that the Soviet Union has a powerful army capable of defeating any enemy's attack." Lubchenko also criticized Germany's National Socialist Party, Japanese militarists, and Polish landlords, accusing them of plotting to attack the Soviet Union. (12th National News Agency Telegram) London – During today's session of the House of Commons, the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing the territorial integrity of China was raised. Labour MP Mr. Banfield wanted to know if Foreign Minister Hirota's recent statement that China must resolutely abandon its policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" had influenced the United Kingdom. If so, it would contradict the recent British statement opposing this policy towards China. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that he was unaware of Hirota's declaration. The Nine-Power Treaty was signed in 1922 by the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China, serving as the political basis for the Washington Naval Treaty. In the Naval Treaty, the United States abandoned its intention to protect its Far Eastern interests, permitting the construction of a large naval program to ensure China's territorial integrity. The Nine-Power Treaty stipulated that: the signatory powers respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity; guarantee China the opportunity to develop a strong government freely and without constraint; uphold the principle of equal opportunity for the commercial interests of all nations; and the signatory powers must not exploit the situation in China to seek special interests detrimental to the benefits enjoyed by citizens of other friendly nations.

<h3>The Truth About the United States Selling Large Quantities of Gold to Our Country</h3>
<p>To Facilitate Silver Standard Countries Adopting a Bimetallic System</p>
<p>London – News from Washington yesterday stated that China has purchased over US$9.9 million worth of gold from the United States. This action confirms the US intention, as previously reported, to facilitate silver standard countries in establishing a bimetallic system. Considering the recent negotiations between the United States and Mexico, where the US Treasury exchanged gold for Mexican silver, this claim is undoubtedly true. It is generally believed that after recent negotiations in Shanghai between representatives of China and the United States, the Chinese government has agreed to exchange silver for gold. Banking professionals here believe that recent purchases of gold pounds in the London market, exceeding £300,000, on behalf of the Chinese government, are evidence of this silver-for-gold exchange between the two countries. Similar transactions are expected to occur in the London market in the future, enabling China to convert part of the US dollars earned from selling silver into gold pounds, totaling approximately £250,000. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that the Chinese government, aware of the fluctuating international exchange rates, prefers to convert its overseas earnings into gold pounds to balance exchange rates, rather than purchasing gold. (13th Havas Telegram) London – The silver market previously suspended trading on Saturdays and Sundays. It has now been decided that starting from February 15, trading will resume as usual on Saturdays and Sundays. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Wireless Telephone Communication Opens</h3>
<p>Nanjing – Three years ago, with only the Qingdao-Japan route, the Ministry of Communications' International Radio Station opened wireless telegraph communication between China and Japan, providing one more channel for Sino-Japanese telecommunications.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Pittman's Speech</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch on the 10th, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated in the Senate that Japan has now torn up the Nine-Power Treaty, and the United States must rush to build up a strong naval and air force to maintain the dignity of peace treaties. The implication is that the United States should quickly catch up with Japan's aggressive actions and impose sanctions with real strength. Pittman made an even clearer statement on December 20th last year, saying that Japan's ambitions today are quite similar to those of pre-war Germany, and its goal is to conquer the world, with the annexation of China being only the initial plan. Therefore, the United States will eventually be forced to the point of unbearable conflict with Japan. Judging from these two speeches, Pittman's intention clearly indicates that a US-Japan war is almost inevitable, it is only a matter of time. Pittman is a leader in the legislative branch on foreign affairs, and his views are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Since the Democratic Party came into power in the United States, there have been few criticisms of Japan's militaristic policies. When the Italian-Ethiopian War broke out, the United States was even more eager to create neutrality laws, clearly indicating its unwillingness to get involved in European affairs, and even less willing to strictly enforce the principle of freedom of the seas, which the United States has always regarded as an supreme right. This situation has led the world to have a false impression that the United States is now like a snail, deeply hidden in its shell, unwilling to contend with others. Japan took advantage of this opportunity to further pursue its attempt to monopolize East Asia, proposing to negotiate with the United States to divide hegemony over the Pacific Ocean. According to recent unofficial news, Hirota even wants to use the 180-degree meridian as the boundary between the two countries' spheres of influence, not allowing US influence to extend west of Midway Island. His intention to prevent the United States from further interfering in Far Eastern affairs is very obvious, and it is undoubtedly in great conflict with the US Open Door Policy. Under these circumstances, American officials can no longer remain silent. President Roosevelt's New Year's address launched a major attack on the world's militaristic countries, and Pittman has now openly denounced Japan. The intention of both men is nothing more than to make those advocating militarism reflect slightly.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that American people love peace. However, to ensure world peace, first it is necessary to recognize who are the aggressors and who are the victims, who should be sanctioned and who should be helped. Once this point is determined, it is necessary to gather countries that can cooperate and implement a policy of aiding the weak and suppressing the strong. Otherwise, all words of loving peace will become empty talk. Since the Italian-Ethiopian War, the United States has declared neutrality. Although it has cut off the supply of military materials to Italy, it still has considerable supplies of raw materials for war. How can this prevent the continuation of the war? As for the Far East, the United States has long been aware of who the aggressor is. The United States does not know its current strength is insufficient to cope with this situation, it is also not unaware. However, it cannot even talk about cooperation with Britain, which is most capable of cooperation, it still has suspicions about Russia, which could be called upon, and it is standing idly by in regard to the League of Nations' so-called collective peace policy. Thus, even if American politicians make open expressions aimed at militarists, it will be difficult to slightly reduce the deterioration of the world situation. Therefore, if the United States truly wants to promote genuine world peace, it still needs to make great efforts in practice.</p>
<h3>Resistance Continues Unabated; Northeastern Anti-Japanese Army Growing in Strength</h3>
<p>Now Twelve Armies are Distributed Across North and South Manchuria Employing Guerrilla Warfare, the Japanese Army is Exhausted Female Hero Li Hongguang's Unit is Especially Brave</p>
<p>Changchun – Although the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army is constantly subjected to encirclement and attacks by the Japanese and puppet forces, it has gradually become more unified in organization, and can even manufacture firearms and ammunition. The organizational structure is completely the same as that of a regular army, adopting a three-three system, with divisions into armies, brigades, regiments, battalions, companies, and platoons. Many of the officers have received considerable education, and there are also many Koreans. According to Japanese investigations, the "Anti-Japanese Allied Volunteer Army in Manchuria" is divided into twelve armies. The other six armies are distributed in North Manchuria, while the other six are scattered in the triangular area from Jilin and Andong to near Dalian. The First Army is located along the South Manchuria Railway line in the North Zhou adjacent area, under an unknown commander. The Second Army is located in the Hunchun area, under the command of Zhu Zhen. The Third Army is located in the Zhuhe Panshi area, under the command of Zhao Zhi. The Fourth Army is located in the Mishan Hulin area, under the command of Zhao Yanlu. The Fifth Army is located in the Ning'an Muling Dongling area, under the command of Zhou Baozhong. The Sixth Army is located in the Tangyuan Zichuan area, under an unknown commander. The combat method of the Volunteer Army is purely guerrilla style. Although the Japanese army is well-trained, it cannot effectively counterattack. Furthermore, farmers have faced increased taxes and poor production in recent years, making it impossible for them to make a living. As a result, the number of those joining the Volunteer Army has increased dramatically.</p>
<p>In addition, the female leader Li Hongguang's unit of the Volunteer Army, with over a thousand members, is very active in the Changbai Mountain Batonggou area. They have repeatedly engaged in combat with the Japanese army. For example, the Dongxing County area was originally an important rear defense area of the Japanese army's defense line. From the Yalu River to Dongxing, there were layers of security networks. After September 18th, the defenses became even stricter, with patrols by land and water, day and night. The city of Dongxing County is extremely well-fortified, known as having walls of bronze and iron. However, the courageous female commander Li Hongguang, with just eighty people, broke through the impenetrable defense line, penetrated deep into enemy territory, and returned fully loaded. It can truly be described as the first brave act since September 18th. Recently, this unit has also established contact with the "Ya Dongyang" unit of the Volunteer Army, making its strength even greater. This unit has also raised the banner of the "People's Revolutionary Army", opposing the Japanese puppet regime in Manchuria. According to a Japanese person who was detained and released during the Dongxing battle, the woman was dressed as a man, riding a white horse, galloping across the battlefield, exceptionally brave, etc. (Ishikawa Nichika Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>First Representative of the Philippine Government Takes Office in the United States</h3>
<p>Promoting a Free Trade Policy</p>
<p>Washington – The first representative of the Philippine Autonomous Government to the United States, Mr. Peredes, took office here today, and was welcomed by many. Mr. Peredes said, "As the first representative of the Autonomous Government, I would like to convey the greetings and goodwill of the new nation to the United States. The people of the Philippines are very grateful for the past support and fairness of the United States. Now that the political ties have been severed, the Filipinos anticipate closer relations with the United States in friendship, commerce, and spirit. My job is to maintain this relationship." Mr. Peredes stated that he will make every effort to create a free trade policy between the Philippines and the United States, as the separation of trade relations between the two countries would be quite harmful. When asked about his impressions of yesterday's speech by Republican Congressman Steele advocating the withdrawal of US troops from the Philippines, Mr. Peredes replied that this should be decided by Congress. As far as the Philippines is concerned, it is fully capable of self-defense, but it will feel the lack of funding from the US Army Department. Moreover, the Philippines is still under the protection of the United States, and the stationing of troops has no relation to the issue of the security of the Philippines. Officials from the territorial bureau have already prepared the procedures for Mr. Peredes to meet with President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Army En. (12th National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister Explains Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact Operation Must Be Based on National Procedures Britain Decides to Abide by the Locarno Treaty</h3>
<p>Paris – Foreign Minister Flandin recently attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies to explain the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, saying that according to the agreement, even if one of the two signatory countries is attacked without provocation, the system of mutual assistance will not be applied mechanically (i.e., it is not necessary to request the League of Nations to convene a meeting of the Executive Council to obtain its approval before sending troops to assist the other party). Under any circumstances, only the normal procedures stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant can be used. After this treaty is ratified, Germany cannot use it as an excuse to violate the clauses of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the demilitarization of the Rhineland (Articles 42 and 43), as these clauses are not subject to any conditions. In the event that Germany decides to re-fortify the Rhineland, France will immediately contact the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact to jointly devise response steps. Speaking to this point, a committee member questioned whether France would implement an oil embargo against Italy. The Foreign Minister replied that the French government would do its best to implement any decision made by the League of Nations, but he would still carefully monitor the development of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute in order to find a good opportunity to promote a peaceful resolution. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London – The House of Commons recently held a meeting, and Liberal MP Mand asked the government whether, according to the clauses of the Locarno Pact, Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, concerning the demilitarized zone along the Rhine, if Germany (or France) were to openly violate them, the British government would assist France (or Germany), and whether the British government was prepared to abide by these clauses. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the British government would abide by the obligations created by the Locarno Pact, and would resolutely implement them if necessary. According to those familiar with parliamentary affairs, the question raised by Mand only refers to violations of the current treaty without the agreement of all signatory countries to abolish it. In other words, it refers to unilateral violations. As for Eden's reply, it seems that the government and Mand had agreed on it beforehand, and the intention was to imply to Germany that any unilateral action or violent move would not be permitted by Britain. German sources here say that the German government does not intend to re-fortify the Rhineland through unilateral action, but only wants to raise objections in terms of legal principles to prove that the spirit and letter of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact are difficult to reconcile with the Locarno Pact. Generally speaking, this matter will be handled by the countries concerned through diplomatic channels, exchanging views. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact France's Explanation to Germany</h3>
<p>Cannot Be Used as an Excuse to Fortify the Rhineland</p>
<p>Paris – Regarding the issue of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, the German press has been promoting it greatly in recent days, hoping to use France's ratification as an excuse for Germany to re-fortify the demilitarized zone along the Rhine. French Foreign Minister Flandin forcefully rejected this claim at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies last night, stating that there is no room for discussion on the issue of re-fortifying the Rhine. There are three reasons for this: 1. When France and the Soviet Union signed the Mutual Assistance Pact in May last year, the governments of Britain and Italy were consulted, and they immediately expressed their agreement, believing that the treaty did not conflict with the Locarno Pact. Subsequently, on June 25 of that year, the German government sent a memorandum to the French government through its ambassador to France, Köster, expressing its protest. The French government immediately replied that the governments of Britain and Italy had already recognized that the treaty did not conflict with the Locarno Pact. Since then, the German government has not raised this issue again. At that time, German newspapers published articles expressing opposition, but after the French ambassador to Germany, Ponset, managed to correct them, the newspapers stopped their attacks; 2. After the signing of the Locarno Pact in 1924, France, in accordance with this pact, signed mutual assistance treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia respectively. The German government did not protest at that time; 3. If France were to abandon the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, it would invalidate the mutual assistance treaty signed between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union in July last year. If that were the case, Czechoslovakia would lose the Soviet Union's assistance, and France's alliance obligations to Czechoslovakia would be increased. (13th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Passes National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>White Paper to Be Published Next Week</p>
<p>London – The Cabinet held a regular meeting this morning and submitted the government's white paper on the policy of rearming for discussion. As a result, it has been approved. It is generally known that the Cabinet has approved the National Defense Committee's proposal to increase national defense spending. The main difficulty with this proposal lies in domestic affairs, as the opposition party will launch an attack when it is submitted to Parliament for discussion, and the government must prepare for this in advance. It is reported that the three services, the Navy, Army, and Air Force, will be merged into a Ministry of National Defense. It is now known that the Cabinet does not intend to take this decision, but will only take various measures to adjust the naval, land, and air forces to make the spirit of cooperation even closer. It is generally believed that within the next six years, annual military spending will increase by about 50% compared to previous budgets. Part of the required funds will be raised from regular taxes, and another part will be financed by the Ministry of Finance issuing treasury bills each year. Finally, government bonds may be issued to replace previous treasury bills for consolidation. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Conservative MPs Unwilling to Concede Colonies</h3>
<p>Request Government to Provide Guarantees</p>
<p>London – Conservative MP Croft today asked the government in the House of Commons to guarantee that it is not considering ceding any British colonies or mandated territories to foreign countries, and to guarantee that the government will not use its colonies as bargaining chips in any world conference. Liberal MP Mond rose to support him, urging everyone to pay attention to the speech given by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels on January 17, in which Germany intended to demand the return of its colonies. He also asked the government to guarantee that it would not return any mandated territories to the German National Socialist government. Colonial Secretary Thomas replied that the government has never considered ceding British colonies or mandated territories, including protectorates. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes Neutrality Act Amendment</h3>
<p>Arms Embargo Extended to May of Next Year Does Not Apply if Western Hemisphere Countries Are Attacked</p>
<p>Washington – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today unanimously passed a simplified Neutrality Act, extending the arms embargo to May 1, 1937. However, it stipulates that this embargo does not apply if the Republic of America is attacked by a non-American country. As for the most important provisions in the neutrality bill proposed by the government, 1. Authorizing the President to limit the export of military supplies so that it does not exceed the normal export volume, 2. The President can declare that in certain situations, all trade with belligerent countries is at the merchant's own risk, and the government is not responsible for the second rule. Now it has been deleted. (13th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today submitted an amendment to the Senate on the Neutrality Act, prohibiting loans and credit to belligerent countries, and recommended that the existing Neutrality Act, together with the above-mentioned amendment, be extended until May 1 of next year. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Committee, said that because of the more severe neutrality measures, opinions differed on the extent and effectiveness of the issues, so the permanent neutrality law, the prohibition or restriction of the export of goods is difficult to pass, and the Foreign Affairs Committee therefore also agreed to only extend the term of the existing neutrality law. As for the above-mentioned amendment, a clause will also be added, that is, the democratic countries of the Americas can still raise debts in the United States if they are at war with other countries.

<h3>League of Nations Studies Oil Embargo Against Italy: Experts Draft Report</h3>
<p>To be Distributed by Airplane to Various National Capitals To be Distributed by Airplane to Various National Capitals Eighteen-Nation Committee to Convene Early Next Month Geneva After a thorough study by the expert committee of the League of Nations on the effectiveness of an oil embargo against Italy, its report has now been completed and is being sent to various national capitals by airplane. It is expected that the eighteen-member committee will convene in Geneva on March 2 to announce a joint resolution. The report summarizes the experts' discussions and includes three reports from the subcommittee on gasoline substitutes, sales, supply, and transportation. According to the published report of the expert committee, the experts believe that a universal oil embargo against Italy would be effective within three and a half months. If only League of Nations member states implement the embargo and the United States limits its oil exports to Italy to the amounts prior to 1935, it would also be effective. An oil embargo against Italy without the cooperation of the United States would only make it more difficult and expensive for Italy to purchase oil, but would not prevent it from obtaining it. The report recommends that industrial alcohol and petroleum also be included in the embargo to prevent their use as gasoline substitutes. The experts believe that if countries imposing sanctions on Italy prohibit oil tankers from transporting oil to Italy, Italy could use its own ships to transport half of its required oil, and rely on non-League of Nations member states for the remainder. However, acquiring and operating oil tankers would be difficult and costly. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London A key figure in diplomatic circles here recently told a reporter from this agency regarding the kerosene embargo, "As things stand, the League of Nations is waiting for the United States to take action before making a decision, while the United States is also waiting for the League of Nations to take the lead. Both sides are essentially observing each other." It is generally believed that once the expert committee of the League of Nations on the kerosene embargo submits its report, it will be distributed to the relevant countries, and the steps that these countries intend to take in the future will largely depend on the conclusions of this report. As for Britain's attitude, according to foreign sources here, Foreign Secretary Eden has assured Italian Ambassador Grandi that the kerosene embargo will not be implemented on a large scale in the short term. It is now reported that the League of Nations Sanctions Coordination Committee will convene in mid-March to discuss the kerosene embargo. Therefore, Britain's final attitude will not be determined until near the meeting date. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Geneva The expert committee on the kerosene embargo appointed by the League of Nations' eighteen-nation subcommittee recently announced the kerosene supply situation to Italy by various countries in 1934.

<h3>Naval Conference: Battleship Tonnage Determined</h3>
<p>Still at 35,000 Tons</p>
<p>London Representatives of Britain and the United States held a meeting today at the naval conference. Afterwards, it was learned from reliable sources that an agreement on the issue of capital ships could be reached soon. France and Italy are expected to participate in these talks, so that a six-year treaty can be concluded, limiting each country to building three battleships of 35,000 tons, equipped with 14-inch guns. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>London After 90 minutes of talks between British and American representatives today, one of the major obstacles encountered by the naval conference has been removed, and an understanding has been reached on maintaining the 35,000-ton battleship level. However, the caliber of the guns has not yet been agreed upon. It is likely that it will be reduced from 16 inches to 14 inches. The drafting committee will continue to meet twice today, and it is hoped that the work can be completed by Friday. Although Britain and the United States have agreed on a battleship model of 35,000 tons, it is reported that France still hopes to reduce this number. It is rumored that France has suggested a compromise, advocating that each country be allowed to build two 35,000-ton battleships, so as to be on par with the naval power of this type of warship currently being built by France and Italy. The United States may recognize this solution as a temporary measure, but the United States has made it clear that it cannot accept it permanently. As for the hope of inviting Germany and Russia to participate in the naval conference and assist in drafting the pact, it has been dashed. The representatives discussed the matter extensively today, but France consistently refused Germany's participation, because the German navy is illegal. In view of France's attitude, Britain now intends to propose a mediation plan, advocating that the progress of the drafting committee's work be communicated to Germany at any time, in order to induce Germany to comply with the methods agreed upon at the naval conference, because Britain is unwilling to immediately sign any substantive restriction treaty that Germany does not join. (Reuters, 12th) London Representatives of Britain and France at the naval conference held talks this afternoon in the office of Foreign Secretary Eden to discuss the issue of substantive restrictions, especially the tonnage of capital ships, which is extremely important. The French representatives were Ambassador to Britain Corbin and experts Vice Admiral Robert and Colonel Troussel, while the British representatives were Foreign Secretary Eden and naval affairs expert Claych of the Foreign Office. It is generally understood that the outcome of the talks has not substantially changed the situation regarding the formation of a naval agreement, because Eden firmly urged France to accept the limit of 35,000 tons, and said that the United States would not back down on this point, and the naval conference should not be allowed to fall into a deadlock. French Vice Admiral Robert raised objections based on budgetary and technical reasons, saying that the construction cost difference between 35,000 tons and 25,000 tons is as much as 350,000,000 francs. The original purpose of the naval conference was to strive for economy, but now the costs are being increased, which is somewhat contrary to the original intention. Moreover, in terms of the current state of French naval port facilities, the huge 35,000-ton warships are also not very suitable. If the harbors must be dredged and the length of the docks increased to accommodate these giant ships, then huge sums of money will be required everywhere, which France can hardly afford. Because the British representatives insisted, the French representatives agreed to temporarily accept the 35,000-ton figure, stating in the future agreement that it was temporary in nature, and that if the naval powers consult with each other and reach an agreement in the future, then this tonnage should still be reduced. Britain opposed this method, only allowing the future agreement to stipulate that the signatory countries have the obligation to consult each other on the tonnage of capital ships in the future. Currently, British and French talks are still in progress. According to British naval figures, the hope of establishing substantive restrictions will only arise after the issue of inviting Germany to participate in the naval conference is resolved. According to Britain, the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States should conclude an agreement before inviting Germany to participate, while France only allows the content of the agreement to be notified to Germany. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>London After the talks between the British and French representatives at the naval conference, American representatives Norman Davis, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Standley, and Chargé d'Affaires Atherton of the U.S. Embassy went to the Foreign Office to hold talks with Foreign Secretary Eden, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Chatfield, and Foreign Office expert Claych. It is generally understood that the United States may accept a compromise on the issue of capital ship tonnage, that is, if the future agreement allows the United States to build two capital ships of 35,000 tons and a gun caliber of 14 inches during a certain period, then it may be possible to discuss imposing stricter restrictions on capital ship tonnage in the future. According to American sources, the above suggestion is currently under consideration and has been telegraphed to Paris to solicit the opinion of the French government. The Italian delegation hopes that the country will be allowed to build two more capital ships in addition to the two 35,000-ton capital ships currently being built, but if a compromise is reached according to the American suggestion, then this proposal may be abandoned. (Havas, 12th) London The drafting subcommittee, which was recently appointed by the expert subcommittee of the General Committee of the naval conference, held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the qualitative limits of various types of warships (except capital ships) and draft an agreement. The progress was very good. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Abolition of the Mui Tsai System Investigation Committee Studies Methods British Colonial Secretary Answers Member Questions</h3>
<p>London The practice of Mui Tsai in Hong Kong has a long history, and Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote intends to find ways to abolish it. A commission of inquiry was previously organized to study methods and submit a report to the government. Member of Parliament Whyte recently questioned the matter in the House of Commons. The commission's report has revealed that the situation of Mui Tsai in Hong Kong is unsatisfactory. How will the government deal with it? Colonial Secretary Thomas replied, "The Governor of Hong Kong has reported that the report is currently being considered by the Standing Land Review Committee, which is organized by well-known Chinese figures in the region. I hope to learn of their review opinions soon, and I will submit a report to the House of Commons at that time. Please do not make any suggestions before the government has decided on a solution. I dare to guarantee to you that once I have read the report that the committee is about to submit, I will implement the promise I made a few years ago regarding the abolition of the Mui Tsai system."

<h3>Japan's Election Battle Intensifies</h3>
<p>Pro-Government Faction Dominates</p>
<p>Tokyo As the general election enters its third stage, the situation is extremely tense. The number of candidates nominated by the various political parties has reached 877, exceeding the number of seats by one fold. The authorities will, in accordance with Article 67 of the House of Representatives Election Law, stop processing registrations at 12:00 p.m. on the 13th. Among the 122 districts nationwide, there are only two districts without competition: the first district of Kumamoto Prefecture and the first district of Ishikawa Prefecture. In the remaining 120 districts, the number of candidates nominated by each faction exceeds the number of seats by three to four times, so competition is bound to be fierce. The isolated island of Tobishima Village in the second district of Yamagata Prefecture in the Sea of Japan began voting on the 13th, marking the beginning of the nationwide general election battle. (Domei News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Tokyo In this election battle, the non-Seiyukai factions such as the Minseito Party, the Kokumin Domei, and the Showakai have the upper hand, and their elected members may account for more than half of the total. Therefore, the government is now in the process of sorting out important bills to be submitted to the special Diet. The relevant ministries are also investigating various bills.

The two countries immediately entered into negotiations in an attempt to resolve the matter. As of now, these negotiations have almost reached a deadlock. The German government is willing to convert this debt (amounting to about 185,000,000 francs) into marks and deposit it in the Polish government's account as a Polish deposit, but declares that this deposit must be used to purchase German goods. Poland has expressed its opposition to this and insists that Germany must pay the debt in foreign currency. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>Abyssinian Bandits Everywhere Plaguing Inland Merchants</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa Since the outbreak of the war, inland defenses have been weak, resulting in bandits everywhere, plaguing inland merchants. The Ministry of Commerce has recently decided that local officials must send soldiers to protect inland merchants, at a rate of ten soldiers to protect one merchant. For merchants who are robbed by bandits, the losses they suffer should be compensated by the responsible provincial governor. According to this decision by the Ministry of Commerce, it can be seen that even during the external war, the government still regards the development of domestic commerce as its duty, and precautions must be taken against the rampant banditry. In addition, this agency's reporter has also learned that the Ministry of Commerce has taken several measures to increase the value of the Taylors (Abyssinian currency). The value of one Taylor was previously only 4 francs and 25 centimes, but it has now risen to 5 francs and 50 centimes. This is because it is exchanged for coffee and cotton fabrics imported from France (i.e., barter). Since the outbreak of the war, the number of cotton fabric imports has decreased, and merchants are eager to exchange all their possessions for Taylors. As the demand for currency has increased, its value has naturally increased. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Marseille Massacre: Three Accomplices Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Aix-en-Provence, France Former Yugoslav King Alexander and former French Foreign Minister Barthou were assassinated at the port of Marseille on October 9 of the year before last.

The court here previously brought the detained accomplices Laitotz, Posnyski, Cyrille, and Keiber to trial. After lengthy debate, the defendants were each sentenced to life imprisonment.

<h3>Hoover Criticizes the New Deal</h3>
<p>Challenges Roosevelt, Strongly Criticizes Inflationary Tendencies</p>
<p>Bartlesville, USA Former President Hoover spoke at the Republican Lincoln Birthday Commemorative Dinner here today, attacking the New Deal, calling it a "dictatorial and chaotic government" and challenging President Roosevelt, asking "How can the confusion in the budget and monetary system be cleared up?" Hoover strongly criticized the tendency towards credit and inflation, saying, "An explosive and coercive inflation is underway today. The price increases in the stock exchange are not entirely due to believing in the future, but partly due to fear of inflation." Hoover advocated that in the next election, the Republican Party should focus on the constitutional issue and should support the Supreme Court's review of congressional legislation. He believed that "the tyranny of the New Deal has failed, and the people in panic can have a glimmer of hope only because of the Supreme Court." During Hoover's speech, he repeatedly mentioned that "a sound currency" is the foundation of permanent recovery, so national political observers all recognize that this issue may be a major platform in the Republican campaign propaganda. Hoover said, "A stable currency and a balanced budget can reduce unemployment far more than all public works relief programs, so in the next election, we must prevent personal government, bureaucratic politics, and debt expansion from stifling the freedom of the people." Hoover countered the government's claim that prosperity had been restored because stock prices had risen, saying that "Although current stock prices are equal to those of 1926, at that time there was no unemployment, foreign trade was thriving, the government's budget was balanced, and currency prices were quite stable. In contrast, there are 10 million unemployed, foreign trade is declining, the government's budget has an unprecedented deficit, and a country's currency depends on the will of an individual. What a difference!" (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>Death of American Economist Harvey</h3>
<p>Known in his lifetime for advocating bimetallism, in his later years he aspired to build a tower to store books.</p>
<p>Mount Nebo. William Hope Harvey, widely known for advocating bimetallism, passed away today in Mount Nebo, Arkansas, USA, at the age of eighty-four. At the end of the 19th century, he gradually authored a book entitled "Coin's Financial School," which was popular everywhere and became a renowned work of the time. People then called him "Coin Harvey." He later wrote several more books, further enhancing his reputation. He firmly believed that modern civilization would eventually be destroyed, so he planned to build a pyramid to store modern books for future generations to read. Therefore, in his later years, he focused his energy on building this tower and selecting the books to be stored in it. Fearing that no one would continue his work after his death, he specifically organized a Pyramid Committee to ensure the successful completion of his plan. Harvey became a primary school teacher at the age of sixteen, later studied law, and at the age of twenty-one, he practiced law and gained a reputation at the time. He eventually studied finance and wrote books for the world, discerning the reasons for the rise and fall of civilizations, hence his aspiration to build a tower to store books, feeling that people's struggle for power and wealth would eventually destroy the world and return to a savage era, and he could not bear to see modern civilization completely annihilated. The location he chose for building the tower was Mount Nebo in Arkansas. Geologists recognize this as one of the highest points on Earth in ancient times. Harvey planned a pyramid-shaped tower, 130 feet high, with a base of 40 square feet and a top of 6 square feet, all made of reinforced concrete. The stored books would be kept in the basement. Those who shared Harvey's aspirations included people like 金門士哈定. Now that Harvey has passed away, it is believed that his comrades will definitely continue his work. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Justice Corrects Judges' Case Handling</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The Ministry of Justice noted that in various local courts, there is no distinction between regular judges and probationary judges in the allocation of cases. In some instances, probationary personnel are even assigned to handle second instance cases, which is not a prudent way to administer justice. Furthermore, it has been observed that judges handling civil cases often set aside complex cases and prioritize simple ones in order to meet the case closure quota, which is also inappropriate. On the 13th, a special order was issued to correct these practices. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>The Biological Survey and Research Undertakings That China Urgently Needs to Undertake (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hu Xian</p>
<p>(e) Research on Ornamental Trees</p>
<p>China produces many types of famous ornamental trees, and there are also quite a few famous ornamental trees produced in foreign countries that have not been imported. China's provinces are currently renovating municipal administration, and research on ornamental trees is closely related to this. This type of survey and experimental work should be undertaken by biological research institutions, such as the Guangdong Mountain Botanical Garden, with encouragement from the government.</p>
<p>(f) Paper-Making Research</p>
<p>Paper-making is the most important industry for the utilization of timber. Today, our country has very few people with academic experience in this industry, and even less knowledge of where to obtain raw materials. For example, 云杉 and 铁杉 are commonly used pulpwood, and they also grow in abundance in China, especially spruce forests in Sichuan, which cover a vast area. In the past, China mostly used bamboo for papermaking, but the manufacturing methods were improper, resulting in poor quality. Recently, India has discovered through experimentation that bamboo that has grown for only one year can be used to make pulp. Which type of domestically produced bamboo is most suitable for papermaking? A large-scale survey and research must be conducted before a afforestation policy can be determined and cultivation can be widely promoted. For example, the hybrid poplar mentioned above and the 奥椿 tree, which is most commonly seen in the north, can all be used for papermaking. All of this should be the subject of appropriately funded research by a designated institution.</p>
<p>(g) Research on Other Industrial Raw Materials Related to Forests</p>
<p>There are many types of other industrial raw materials related to forests. Tung oil and lacquer are the most important. Currently, the United Kingdom and the United States are cultivating tung oil trees on a large scale. If China does not improve its tung seed and oil extraction methods, it will not be able to maintain its current large export volume in the future. Other types of fiber industries, rayon raw material industries, the manufacture of pine oil, etc. – the problems of forest utilization cannot all be listed at once. Research on the cultivation of rubber trees and teak is also an important policy for developing the tropical regions of Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and is closely related to national defense issues. In recent years, a Swedish scientist discovered that the seed oil produced by a type of aspen tree can be roasted to make cocoa. A few years ago, the match king planned to come to China to establish a factory to manufacture it, but this plan was interrupted due to his suicide. Mr. Qin Renchang, director of the Lushan Forest Botanical Garden, has said that he personally tasted cocoa made with bark oil in Denmark, and its taste was no different from the real thing, and the manufacturing method was very simple. The patent rights are only selling for 100,000 yuan. It is imperative to contact this inventor. If this industry can be established in China, it will be a new source of wealth for the country. Research on all these forest utilization industries should be carried out as soon as possible by industrial and biological institutions in conjunction.</p>
<p>Research on Fiber Plants</p>
<p>The importance of fiber as a raw material for spinning and weaving is self-evident. The most important weaving raw material is cotton. The Cotton Industry Improvement Association is already engaged in large-scale research and promotion in this area. The next most important is rayon, which falls within the scope of forest utilization and the chemical industry. However, there may also be other plants that can be used as raw materials for rayon, which requires large-scale investigation and experimentation. Among other plant fibers, the most important in China is ramie. Summer cloth is a unique product of our country, but its drawback is that its fibers have a layer of glue, so it is generally perceived to be stiff and icy, suitable for summer clothing but not for winter clothing, and cannot replace flax for spinning linen. If a method of retting ramie or chemical processing of ramie can be invented to remove the glue, then summer cloth can be machine-made and become the linen yarn needed in winter, which can greatly increase national wealth. Furthermore, ramie leaves can be used to raise silkworms. Those engaged in silkworm and mulberry cultivation in our country twenty years ago have not paid any attention to this point. Now it is necessary to experiment to see how many leaves can be picked from each mu of ramie field to raise silkworms without damaging the quality of the ramie. Wild ramie grows everywhere in our country. If we research how to improve the method of making ramie on the one hand, and promote the use of ramie leaves to raise silkworms on the other, then our country's silkworm farming can become a sideline to planting ramie, reducing costs and lowering prices. If we further improve the methods of raising silkworms, we may not need to compete with Japanese silk for the shrinking world market. In addition, jute bags are entirely imported from India, and the amount of imports each year is considerable. If our country cultivates this raw material plant, or replaces it with other fiber plants, it will also be a way to curb leakage. There are many other fiber plants that can be researched and cultivated, such as New Zealand flax, which is said to be able to replace cotton. Under the current circumstances, the Cotton Production Improvement Association and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station do not have the time to study this type of research, so it is appropriate to entrust and subsidize existing biological research institutions to undertake the research.

<h3>Lecture on History - The Application of National History Teaching Materials in Primary and Secondary Schools - Full-time Translator of the National Institute for Compilation and Translation</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hesheng</p>
<p>The outline of teaching materials specified in the national history curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools in our country, except for the primary school section, which is a self-contained unit, all the junior and senior high school sections narrate programs with the era as the outline and facts as the warp. The program distribution is 63 in the junior high school section and 113 in the senior high school section, with a ratio of approximately 1 to 2, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>The titles of the sections are generally more concise in junior high school and more detailed in senior high school, but the amount of detail also varies. For example, when talking about the history of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in ancient history, the junior high school section only lists two sections, "The Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods" and "Academic Thought of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods," while the senior high school section lists five sections, "The Hegemony of the Spring and Autumn Period," "The Seven Powers of the Warring States Period," "The Expansion of Central Plains Culture and Territory," "Academic Thought of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods," and "Political Reforms of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Periods." When talking about the history of the Qin Dynasty in ancient history, the junior high school section lists "The Unification of the Qin Dynasty and Its Policies" and "The Military Achievements of the Qin and Han Dynasties," one and a half sections. When talking about the history of Sino-Western exchanges in modern history, the junior high school section lists "The Gradual Flourishing of Sino-Western Exchanges and the Introduction of Western Learning," one section, while the senior high school section lists "The End of the Ming and Qing Dynasties," "The Eastern Plunder of Europeans," and "The Transmission of Christianity and Western Science," three sections. When talking about the history of the revolutionary movement in the late Qing Dynasty in modern history, the junior high school section lists a general discussion of "Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the Revolutionary Movement" and "The Xinhai Revolution and the Establishment of the Republic of China," two sections, while the senior high school section lists "The Rise of Revolutionary Thought and Mr. Sun Yat-sen," "The Revolutionary Movement in the Late Qing Dynasty," and "The Xinhai Revolution and the Establishment of the Republic of China," three sections. For example, when talking about general discussions or conclusions, the junior high school section only lists four concluding sections, while the senior high school section has two parts, introduction and conclusion, with a total of six sections. The details of the distribution of senior high school teaching materials and junior high school teaching materials are sometimes in a ratio of three to one, sometimes in a ratio of five to two, sometimes in a ratio of three to two, and sometimes in a ratio of one and a half to one. The standard for detailed distinction is determined by the importance of the fact itself and the needs of students' knowledge.</p>
<p>Regarding the work requirements, there is also an important difference: the junior high school side stipulates that teachers should apply the outline to control the extensive historical facts and help students understand. On the one hand, they can also designate the simple and easy-to-understand parts of the textbook to let students make an outline. (That is, divide the original text into several sections, each section is divided into subsections in sequence) to enable students to practice the ability to extract the essence of historical facts and understand the general meaning. The senior high school side advocates the adoption of problem-based discussions, and at the same time, students should be trained to research problems, because senior high school history teaching already has a three-year foundation in junior high school. More attention should be paid to cultivating the ability to learn freely. The education authorities have declared that the study of history subjects should only take its usual position in junior high school, seeking to be able to apply it, while senior high school should study it deeply as the basis of learning.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Fu Sinian criticized, "The authors of this curriculum standard seem to have not seen a few principles that run through the entire course, but are busy piling up topics from generation to generation, making reading it feel quite like a catalog of the History Compendium, which is a misunderstanding of only seeing rigid programs and not seeing living teaching methods." May I ask, junior high school students have no concept of national history facts. Can they understand if you teach them a few principles that run through the entire course? Mr. Fu also said: "If you want to prevent students from disliking history and to receive the effects of setting up this lesson, it is better to say less things and explain them clearly than to say more things and not explain them clearly. Those who compile textbooks, restricted by the formulation of standards, have things that must be said, which is forgivable, but the problems caused by this should be corrected, whether by the Ministry of Education or by the compilers." Based on the above reasons, Mr. Fu set the following principle: "Within the prescribed number of words and time limit, reduce the number of historical events to the minimum and fully describe each historical event to the maximum extent." I extremely agree with this principle, but this method is suitable for compiling senior high school textbooks, but not for compiling junior high school textbooks.</p>
<p>The issue of the distribution of history teaching materials in junior and senior high schools seems to have attracted people's attention. This year, the National History Textbook Compilation Association for Middle Schools issued a slight announcement on this issue. Their answer to the distribution problem is this: Vertical division is adopted in junior high school, and horizontal division is adopted in senior high school. The so-called vertical division means separately narrating the vertical aspects of history, such as ethnic conflicts and separations, the opening up of national borders, changes in material life, the evolution of social structures... etc., with each aspect being a paragraph from ancient times to the present. They believe that this method is most suitable for a concise overview and a tracing of the status quo, which are exactly what preliminary historical knowledge requires. The so-called horizontal division means taking the entire era as a paragraph, the purpose of which is to display the special features of each era. They believe that this is suitable for a deep understanding of history. In junior high school, the present is detailed and the past is brief, and the recent is detailed and the distant is brief. In senior high school, the narration of each era strives to be comparatively average. They believe that junior high school history teaching materials should focus on explaining the present. Generally speaking, the closer the history is, the deeper the impact on the present, so it should be more detailed. Senior high school history courses should focus on a comparative and in-depth understanding of each era, so they require a comparatively average narration. These opinions are very noteworthy.</p>
<p>Although the current distribution of teaching materials in junior and senior high schools has differences in detail, they are all arranged in a sectional format, and they are both limited by the era, which has the drawback of being duplicated, and the senior high school sections are even more cumbersome than those in junior high school. It is also not easy to express the entire central issue in history, so it seems necessary to improve. Fortunately, in the work requirements of the curriculum standard, it is stated that junior high school students should try to make an outline of the simple and easy-to-understand parts to cultivate the ability to understand the general meaning; senior high school students are encouraged to use problem-based discussions to cultivate the ability to research things, which can remedy this drawback. According to my personal opinion, junior high school students are still young and have not had the opportunity to accept ordinary common sense about national history facts. The various aspects of history, such as politics, military affairs, territory, society, economy, transportation, foreign affairs, religion, academics, and art, should be outlined as ordinary lectures, and the era should be the main focus, so that students have a rich common sense of the general situation of each era and each event, without having to explain and study special events in detail. As for senior high school students, since they are older and have a foundation of ordinary historical knowledge, they may wish to conduct a detailed review of the most important events in history that are related to modern life. These events can be taken as teaching materials with the entire topic as the headline. For example, the issue of national political systems, the issue of social organizations, the issue of land, economic issues, customs issues, election issues, examination issues, supervision issues...etc., can all be used as research materials.</p>
<p>To sum up the above two points, purely taking the teaching materials as the object, one belongs to the scope of teaching materials, and the other belongs to the issue of the teaching process. Teachers and compilers should pay attention to it. In addition, although textbooks are the most important tool in education, the teaching materials should be used flexibly by the teachers, and they must not be limited by the textbook. Let them read their books in a way that enables them to ask the questions they should study. Charts and objects should be used as much as possible, not only to give students a clear concept, but also to get practical knowledge.</p>
<p>However, the failure of history education in our country recently has gradually been recognized by the academic community. Because people who teach history recently advocate breaking the limitations of dynasties, a class of high school graduates who apply to universities are mostly unclear about the order of the dynasties. Other facts also lack a sense of the era. Students' low level of history is a joke in newspapers and magazines. According to another report, some people regard Yu as a dynasty, and Zhou and Xia are listed side by side, some list the Eastern Han after the Western Han, some list the Sui and Tang before the Jin, some say that the Western Han was destroyed by the Eastern Han, the Northern Song was destroyed by the Liao, or the Southern Song, some say the Western Han was destroyed by the Liao, and the Jin was destroyed by the Ming, some say that the founding emperor of the Song Dynasty was Li Shimin, and some say that the founding emperor of the Qing Dynasty was Yuan Shikai, some say that Zhang Juzheng was the president of the Judicial Yuan, and Yu Qian was the president of the Examination Yuan, some say that building railways was one of the Wuxu Reform. These errors, which come from the hands of high school students, are unimaginable, but there are definitely no such absurd errors in history textbooks, so they cannot be held responsible. Those who should be responsible are the schools and teachers. Because many secondary schools really despise history and geography too much, some lectures on history have no extracurricular references and various charts. The equipment is mostly inadequate. Schools with a larger scale have full-time history teachers, while smaller schools often have teachers from other subjects concurrently serving as history teachers. Among those who hold history teaching positions in middle schools, there are many who are enthusiastic, but even more are perfunctory. As for the students, affected by the school's contempt and the teacher's perfunctory attitude, they have a perfunctory attitude towards history lessons, and they do not pay attention to the relationship between history and society, the country, the nation, and the gains and losses. How can such students become sound citizens? How can such teachers save the country from danger? Because of the failure of secondary history education in the past, we hope that those who compile textbooks should work hard, but the school authorities and teachers who teach history should reflect on themselves, and must not be as contemptuous and perfunctory as before. Students' knowledge level can be improved, otherwise, they will not only be sinners in the education field, but also sinners in society, the country, and the nation. (The End)</p>
<h3>Records of an Examination of Life in the Desert</h3>
<p>— Jin Dui</p>
<p>Out of interest in studying the Northwest, we organized a Northwest Exploration Team last year, departing from Guangzhou in the summer. We spent eight months traveling through the wildlands and towns of Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi provinces, conducting a detailed investigation into various aspects of social life in the Northwest. The report of this investigation is currently being compiled, and we are now selecting a portion of it to publish in the newspaper.</p>
<p>1. Customs of the Ikezhao League in Inner Mongolia</p>
<p>The Ikezhao League is located in the southern part of Suiyuan Province, occupying one-third of the province's total area, and is divided into seven banners. The main products are horses, cattle, sheep, camels, various animal skins, wool, and medicinal materials such as licorice. Horses and cattle are mostly sold in the provinces of Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi. The hides and skins are transported through Tianjin or Shijiazhuang, Shunde, and other places to Shanghai for sale overseas. Licorice is mostly loaded onto ships in the Hetao region and transported by the Yellow River to various inland provinces for sale. Each licorice ship convoy usually consists of hundreds of vessels, demonstrating its large production and sales volume. Other products include fox, wolf pelts, sable tails (i.e., mink), and wild sheepskins (commonly called yellow sheep). The area also produces a kind of green goat skin, which is particularly beautiful, with hair up to five inches long and dazzling luster. It looks like chinchilla at first glance, and each fur coat costs only seven or eight yuan, which is a real bargain. The banners of the League, like Yulin and Shenmu in Shaanxi, and Baotou in Suiyuan, all produce a special kind of wool woven rugs, which are not machine-made, but handmade. The texture is firm and the patterns are exquisite. Each rug can last for decades, and the price is not high, only two yuan per square foot. However, these rugs are afraid of being stored, as they are prone to moths and hair loss. The more they are used, the brighter the luster becomes. After decades, they can be sold as antiques, and their value is several times higher than when they were newly purchased.</p>
<p>The marriage and funeral customs of the seven banners under the jurisdiction of the Ikezhao League are mostly the same. When a Mongolian woman gets married, she is often given a dowry of horses and sheep. A middle-class family provides a dowry of one or two hundred horses and four or five hundred sheep; even the poor provide dozens of horses and hundreds of sheep. Three days after the wedding, the bride and groom each ride a red horse, their bodies covered with red and green silk. Male and female guests all ride horses to escort them. The groom carries a bow and arrows on his back and goes to the husband's house to pay respects to heaven and earth, after which the guests send them to the bridal chamber.</p>
<p>When Mongolian parents die, their children all mourn and weep. At the funeral, a lama is invited to preside over the ceremony, and the body of the deceased is abandoned in the wild desert, while chanting scriptures to help the deceased ascend to heaven. The next day or three days later, they go to see if the body has been eaten by birds and beasts, which is considered auspicious. If not, other lamas are invited to pray or the body is moved to another place until it is eaten by birds and beasts. Only then can they rest assured. This is known as sky burial. Wealthier families also use cremation. At the funeral, the body is tightly wrapped in white cloth and placed in a stove pit behind the mountain, where it is burned with a large amount of firewood. The children of the deceased undo their braids and wear mourning clothes for one month. On anniversaries of death, lamas are invited to chant scriptures, and there is a custom of crying and remembering the deceased on New Year's Eve. As for the custom of visiting graves and sweeping tombs, it does not exist there.</p>
<p>2. Qinghai Native Women: A Matriarchal Society</p>
<p>The native people of Qinghai are strong and fierce and love to drink. Murder is never punished by death, but only by paying a certain amount of property as compensation for the life. There are often cases of families being bankrupted by murder. Men are mostly idle and do not engage in production. Household affairs are entirely in the hands of women. The custom of uxorilocal marriage is prevalent, known as "recruiting a husband to bear children." Men marry into families around the age of twenty and rely solely on women for their livelihoods. Men's occupations are limited to public affairs in the tribe, such as guarding, migrating, trading, or fighting with outsiders. Women are responsible for raising children. From the age of six, they change their hairstyle to that of a married woman, which is considered marriage. They bear sons and daughters without regard to paternity. When the children grow up, they often do not know who their father is. Before marriage, both men and women usually have their own affairs. When women are pregnant, they work as usual, and childbirth is extremely easy. Some women give birth to babies while herding cattle and sheep in the mountains, then carry them back to the tent, place them on the ground, cover them with sheepskin, and go back to work. When children are two or three years old, their mothers often tie one end of a wool rope to their ankles and the other end to the tent post.</p>
<p>Women's clothes are long and reach the ground, with very short sleeves. They only wear one piece, without a shirt inside or pants. They wear a cloth belt around their waist. In winter, they wear leather boots, and in summer, they go barefoot. Boots are used by both men and women, and the styles are the same. Women's hair is braided into countless small braids, sometimes hundreds of them. They only wash their hair once every one or two months, and each washing takes a whole day. Jewelry includes silver hairpins, rings, and agate stones. Earrings are silver bracelets with two strings of coral hanging down. A half-pound copper hook is hung in front of the belt, with a square of coarse cloth handkerchief on the hook. The hair at the back of the head hangs down to the ground, also tied with a large number of copper utensils and pebbles. Clothes are worn day and night. The common attire for winter and summer is a sheepskin coat with the fur side in, with the right arm and breasts exposed. Every morning, a pot of tea is brewed with half a horse manure, and men and women gather around the stove. The housewife sits next to the stove and fries noodles. Everyone drinks enough tea, then hands the bowl to the housewife, who adds a large piece of butter and a handful of fried noodles. Everyone mixes it with their hands and eats it, then drinks one or two more bowls of tea. The only education a mother gives her children is to teach them how to sing. In the mother's eyes, it is a great honor for her children to sing a lot and sing well.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Plans Two Major Transportation Projects</h3>
<p>Construction of the Shantou Radio Station in Chenghai; Five-Year Construction Plan for the Guang-Shan Railway</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communications: The second three-year governance plan of Guangdong Province has concrete plans for transportation construction. The Construction Department has submitted them to the provincial government for approval and implementation in stages. On the 7th of this month, the Construction Department submitted to the provincial government the site map of the Shantou Radio Receiving and Transmitting Stations, submitted by the Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Management Committee, requesting approval for acquisition and ordering Chenghai County to announce it to the public, ordering all owners to submit their deeds for verification and ascertain the land price for review and handling. This was approved by the Provincial Affairs Council to be acquired according to law and handled by the Chenghai County Government. In addition, the construction of the Guang-Shan (from Guangzhou to Shantou) Railway was previously approved by the Fifth Provincial Party Representative Assembly and handed over to the Construction Department for planning. The Construction Department has recently drafted a five-year plan proposal for the construction of the Guang-Shan Railway, stating that the construction of the Guang-Shan Railway is imperative. On the one hand, it is requested that the Ministry of Railways allocate public debt funds and raise funds locally. On the other hand, the national treasury should allocate funds when it is sufficient. Shantou has the Chao-Shan Railway, which has been operating for more than ten years. The route is only twenty-six miles long, and the business has not developed much to this day. The route is too short, and there are no other side businesses along the railway to supplement other income. If the Guang-Shan Railway is built in the future, the Chao-Shan railway will inevitably be affected. Therefore, it is proposed to merge it into the Guang-Shan Railway as part of its completed section. The railway will be valued at a certain amount and repaid in installments. Before the company's funds are fully repaid, the company may elect one person to be a member of the Guang-Shan Railway Construction Committee to ensure fairness. As for the organization of the committee, each county and city along the route will elect one person, and the provincial government and the Construction Department will each send one person. Five members will be elected from the members, and two supervisors will be elected. The election method of the members is as follows: one person from the provincial government, one person from the Construction Department, one person from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, one person from Huilai County, one person from Chao'an County, one person from Panyu County, one person from Dongguan County, one person from Boluo County, one person from Puning County, one person from Shantou City, one person from Huiyang County, one person from Haifeng County, one person from Lufeng County, one person from Jieyang County, and one person from the Chao-Shan Railway Company. The construction of the Guang-Shan Railway is planned to be carried out in five phases, and the fundraising bonds will also be handled in five phases. The railway route and budget are as follows: starting from Shahe in Guangzhou, passing through Boluo, Huiyang, Renshanxu, Haifeng, Lufeng, Huilai, Puning, Jieyang, Chao'an, connecting to the existing Chao-Shan Railway to Shantou, for a total length of three hundred miles. Survey fee: 300,000 yuan; Land purchase: 900,000 yuan; Roadbed: 4,752,000 yuan; Bridges: 8,400,000 yuan; Culverts: 2,400,000 yuan; Sleepers: 4,752,000 yuan; Rails: 13,500,000 yuan; Passenger and freight cars: 980,000 yuan; Locomotives: 800,000 yuan; Stations and car factories: 600,000 yuan; Telephone and telegraph: 210,000 yuan. In the first year, instruments will be purchased and a survey team will be formed. 1. Preliminary survey will take about one and a half months. 2. Actual survey will take about three months. 3. Final survey will take about four months. In the second year, after the final survey is completed, construction will be started in sections. In the third year, the entire railway bridge and culvert will be completed, and after the completed roadbed is compacted, sleepers and rails will be laid. In the fourth year, stations and car factories will be equipped, car cards, freight cars, and locomotives will be purchased, and road construction will continue. In the fifth year, stations and car factories will be equipped, telephone and telegraph wire materials will be purchased, and workers will be hired to install them. When the road construction project is about to be completed and opened to traffic, a management bureau will be established to be responsible for road affairs.

<h3>Bandit Leader Yu Fengming Killed While Disturbing Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communications: The remnant bandits in the border area of Jing, Xuan, Ning, and Jing counties in southern Anhui have been in dire straits since Liu Zhenhua's troops, led by Brigade Commander Ruan Xun, surrounded and suppressed them with the 5th and 6th Security Regiments. On the 8th of this month, the bandits made contact with the 11th Company of the 6th Security Regiment in Xiaocenkeng, Jing territory. Unable to hold out, they attempted to retreat to Xikeng. Brigade Commander Ruan arrived with the Bai Battalion. The bandits were in a dilemma, but still tried to break through. Battalion Commander Bai led his troops to a head-on attack. Under the fierce suppression of the National Army, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. Bandit leader Yu Fengming (from Qianshan), nicknamed "Little Phoenix," was indeed killed in this battle, according to surrendered bandits. Another group of bandits attacked Baiguoshu, the border area between Xuan and Jing. The 8th Company of the 5th Security Regiment caught up and engaged the bandits in a fierce battle for two hours.

<h3>Guangdong Authorities Strictly Maintain Public Security in Chao-Shan</h3>
<p>Shantou Public Security Bureaus Replenish Police Equipment; Guangzhou Communications: After the Kakuta Incident in Shantou, the Japanese side intended to make a big fuss. According to the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side, Kakuta was assassinated by seven people, and they repeatedly asked our government to arrest the murderers. However, there is no conclusive evidence that Kakuta was murdered. Only two bullet casings with slight traces of blood were attached, claiming that he was murdered. Moreover, the Shantou Municipal Government had previously ordered the Public Security Bureau to send people to investigate the incident area from house to house. No one heard gunshots when the incident occurred that day. As a result, the local residents all signed and certified that they did not hear any gunshots that day. Therefore, the bullet casings attached by the Japanese consul are not sufficient to prove the murder case. After receiving the letter from the Japanese consul, the provincial government immediately ordered Gan Jiehou, the special envoy of the two Guang provinces for foreign affairs, to protest to the Japanese consulate in Shameen twice, requesting that the three Japanese warships "Yubari," "Hayakaze," and "Akikaze" quickly leave Shantou to avoid causing misunderstandings between the two sides. However, the Japanese consul dismissed the arrival of the Japanese warships in Shantou, claiming that the Japanese sailors happened to be there for exercises and did not seem to agree to leave immediately. In order to maintain public security, the Shantou authorities have recently ordered the Shantou Military Police Corps to strictly consolidate defenses and strictly investigate traitors who take the opportunity to cause trouble, given that the Japanese warships have not yet left. The Shantou Public Security Bureau has imposed ordinary martial law for several days in order to maintain local stability. In order to increase local self-defense capabilities, it has specially requested the Municipal Government to submit a request to the Eastern District Pacification Office for replenishing police firearms and replacing bullets. The Eastern District Pacification Office had no firearms to allocate. However, it was found that the Third Special Service Battalion of the Ninth Division of the Third Army had previously stored 300 rifles, which could be allocated. It was submitted to the General Headquarters for approval and allocated in full for replenishment, and a letter was sent to the provincial government for record. Yesterday, the Shantou Public Security Bureau was instructed to transfer them to various public security bureaus and send personnel to the office to collect them. (February 9)</p>
<h3>Promotion of Sugarcane Planting in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Zhangpu Propagates Javanese Sugarcane Seedlings and Promotes Them to Various Counties; Sugarcane Seedlings are Loaned and Matched with Cash Loans to Farmers</p>
<p>Xiamen Communications: Fujian Province was originally a sugar-producing area. After the opening of maritime trade, it was affected by the dumping of foreign sugar, resulting in the decline of local sugar industry. The Jianying Yunna Project and the Provincial Sugar Industry hired technicians from the National Economic Commission to come to Fujian for investigation. The land in Putian and Xianyou in Xinghua, southern Fujian, and Longxi and Zhangpu in Zhangzhou, were found to be most suitable for sugarcane planting. It was proposed to establish sugar factories in Putian and Longxi, starting with Longxi first. Subsequently, it was found that the purchase of machinery and equipment for a sugar factory required a minimum investment of 3 million yuan, which was not affordable by the current finances of Fujian Province. Secondly, the vicinity of a sugar factory required at least 100,000 mu or more of sugarcane fields to supply the raw materials for sugar production. Farmers in southern Fujian have long been accustomed to planting rice, and it is not clear whether planting sugarcane is more profitable than planting rice. Therefore, it was decided this year to promote the benefits of planting sugarcane and promote sugarcane planting, so that sugarcane fields would gradually expand and production would increase. A small sugar-making machine was purchased to improve the method of sugar making. It was found that the old manual method of sugar making could extract 50 catties of sugar syrup per dan of sugarcane. If a new-style sugar-making machine was used, 75 catties could be obtained. In addition, the old method required wages of 1.5 yuan per dan of sugarcane, while the machine only required 0.75 yuan, a difference of two times, or 200 percent. The Construction Department specially purchased improved Javanese sugarcane seedlings from Taiwan, propagated sugarcane seedlings in Zhangpu County, and sold them to farmers in various counties through rural cooperatives for planting. Tong'an has purchased 100,000 seedlings. A provincial telegram was received the other day, ordering the preparation of 1.26 million seedlings for Xianyou to purchase and transport. Personnel will be sent to collect and transport them soon. Longxi has also purchased 50,000 seedlings for trial planting. The sugarcane seedling field of Zhangpu Rural Cooperative has methods for lending sugarcane seedlings and planting sugarcane. Farmers can borrow seedlings and money first, and repay the price after the sugarcane is grown and sold. It is calculated that the loan of Javanese sugarcane seedlings is based on 1,000 plants as a unit, at 2.5 yuan per 1,000 plants. When necessary, a cash loan of 7.5 yuan can be matched as fertilizer cost. The interest rate is 8 yuan per month, and the maximum term is one year. The principal and interest must be repaid in full upon maturity. The loan procedure requires the application of the representatives of each Bao chief, who are responsible for repayment, and must be guaranteed by the district office of this area. Those who obtain the guarantee of the district office in this area with more than three guarantors or reliable shop guarantors can also borrow funds. After the sugarcane planting is popular, the establishment of large-scale sugar factories will be carried out. (February 12)</p>
<h3>Nanzha Night Boat Robbery Solved</h3>
<p>The Zhoupu boat left the city for Zhoupu on the evening of the 10th. When it arrived at Fanjiaba, Sanzao, two small fishing boats came head-on. Five or six bandits jumped out of the cabin, shouted for the boat to stop, and searched the boat owner, Xiao Ahe, after boarding the boat. They robbed him of silver dollars, gold rings, and the passenger Wu Xixiang's fur coat. A certain female passenger's fur qipao was also stripped off. After the bandits left, Xiao Ahe went ashore and reported to the Sanzao Chamber of Commerce, which immediately dispatched people to search and arrest. It was already late at night when they arrived at the door of Fan Fusheng's house. They caught sight of the lights and voices inside the room, and became suspicious. They knocked on the door and entered. The well-known thief Fan Futang was inside. When he saw the members, he jumped out of the back window and escaped. They were unable to catch him. They found three original stolen coats in Fan Fusheng's house. A certain Jia, a boatman, knew that Xiao Ahe's boat would be leaving that night and collected more than 200 yuan in cargo payments from merchants. He told Fan Futang to gather a group to rob the boat and ordered the money to be distributed. The clothing was deposited by Fan and so on. The Chamber of Commerce, considering that it was late at night, temporarily detained Fan Fusheng and his wife. Unexpectedly, they were negligent for a moment, and Fan and his wife escaped in the meantime. After the Chamber of Commerce discovered this, they sent people to hunt them down and reported to the Xinchang Public Security Sub-Bureau by telephone to send police to assist in the pursuit. It was not until dawn that Fan Fusheng was caught. His wife had escaped. Yesterday, Fan Fusheng was transported with the stolen goods to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Hundreds of Refugees Assault Villagers</h3>
<p>On the night of the 11th, more than 200 male and female refugees from Shishou County arrived at Wu Village, Baoxue Township, Yepu District, Songjiang, requesting rations. When their request was not granted, the refugees took Wu Yinpu's son away, which aroused public outrage. They beat drums to gather people. The two sides, each with fifty or sixty people, fought with weapons. As a result, six villagers were injured: Wang Quanfa, Zhou Huogen, Zhou Asi, Lu Ziren, Ling Ada, Zhou Agou, etc., and two gold rings, two gold bracelets, and fifty yuan in paper money were lost. The next day, they reported the incident to Inspector Zong of the 8th Public Security Sub-Bureau under his jurisdiction. After a brief interrogation, he went to the county bureau in the city on the afternoon of the 13th to report and ask for instructions. The bureau gave four instructions: 1. No further incidents are allowed. 2. Refugees should be properly guarded against and persuaded. 3. The injured should be treated quickly. 4. The county magistrate should ask for instructions nearby in Yexie.</p>

After briefly asking her age and origin, he read the judgment. Ling Zhou was sentenced to death for the crime of murder and deprived of public rights for life. After hearing the verdict, Ling Zhou remained dumbfounded and silent. Judge Liu immediately addressed her, saying, "If you do not agree with the judgment of this court, you can appeal. If you do not have money, you can also report to the warden to appeal on your behalf." After the statement, she was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Improve After the New Year</h3>
<p>There are six textile factories in this county: Shenxin, Qingfeng, Yukang, Zhenxin, and Yeqin. Last year, Zhenxin and Yeqin factories temporarily suspended operations due to difficulties in maintaining operations. The remaining factories operated as usual. Last year, the factories were affected by the sluggish market. Except for Shenxin No. 3 Factory, which had a slight profit, the others only maintained expenses. Since the New Year, yarn sales in the factories have improved, and the daily production volume can be roughly sold out. Shenxin No. 3 Factory currently operates 65,000 spindles, producing more than 160 pieces of yarn per day, which are sold to Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Shanghai. Qingfeng No. 1 and 2 Factories currently operate 68,000 spindles, producing more than 180 pieces of yarn per day, which are sold to North China, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. Guangqin and Yukang Factories currently operate 38,000 spindles, producing more than 50 pieces of yarn each per day, which are sold to Jiangyin, Changshu, Jinghu, and various villages in this county. As for Yeqin Yarn Factory, there have been recent news of adding new shares to prepare for revival. It is reported that the total capital amount is set at 150,000 yuan.

<h3>Labor Service Opens Deyuan Road</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Government previously issued the Outline of National Labor Service Methods according to the order of the Provincial Government, stipulating that the period from November 1, 24th year of the Republic to March 31, 25th year of the Republic is the national labor service season in Jiangsu Province. All able-bodied men aged 18 to 45 must participate, including civil servants, soldiers, teachers, and students. Each person must perform at least three days of labor service. County Magistrate Long, considering the proximity of the construction period, actively prepared. On the 21st of last month, he convened a preparatory meeting for national labor service for civil servants in Wuxi County, deciding to open Deyuan Road outside the West Gate. The Construction Bureau measured and planned it and submitted it to the Construction Department for approval. It was decided that construction would be carried out every Sunday from the 15th of this month, and each person would perform at least three days of labor service. The tools used would be prepared by the agencies themselves, and the expenses would be temporarily paid by the county government, and then shared by the agencies. The number of people who should participate in all agencies has been reported to the Construction Bureau for team formation and section construction. The 16th of this month is the first Sunday for the implementation of the work.

<h3>Various Industries Request Reduction of Business Tax Rates</h3>
<p>The trade associations of more than ten industries, such as oil, wine, and timber in Wu County, jointly submitted a request to the County Chamber of Commerce, stating that the business of each industry was declining and the donation taxes were heavy, which was truly unbearable. They requested that the business tax rates of each industry be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, according to the decisions of the Likin Tax Conference, to be reduced separately, not exceeding two per thousand, in order to reduce the burden.</p>
<h3>Construction of Pinghu Motor Road</h3>
<p>Since the opening of public buses on the Su-Jia Highway, the transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been smooth. The Su-Jia Highway will be connected to the Pinghu Motor Road. After the opening of the road, it will only take two or three hours to reach Suzhou from Huzhou. It is named Pinghu Highway, and it is planned to rename the Su-Jia Highway to Su-Jia-Hu Highway.

<h3>Changshu: Rice Mill Strike Not Yet Settled</h3>
<p>The Runfeng Rice Mill outside Xiaodongmen in this area dismissed three workers, including Zhang Yinchang, last year, and a dispute arose between labor and management. Although both the Party and government mediated, and a settlement was arbitrated, advising the management to reinstate the dismissed workers, the storm temporarily subsided. Unexpectedly, the management delayed implementing the agreement, causing the storm to resurface, and called on the trade unions to provide assistance. It has been decided that on the 14th of this month, they will jointly hold a large-scale demonstration and petition with the trade unions. However, the management still insists on the previous proposal and is unwilling to continue to employ the dismissed workers, and has filed a lawsuit with the judicial authorities. However, in order to avoid the expansion of the situation, the Party Department sent a letter to the County Government yesterday, instructing it to immediately implement the arbitrated agreement of the previous proposal. After receiving the letter, the County Government believed that Runfeng Factory had filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and was not in violation of the law. It requested the implementation because there were no clear regulations. It replied in the letter and specially submitted it to the province for instructions. It is expected that both parties in this case are tending to extremes, and the storm is difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou: Prosperity Declines Greatly in Xianzheng Town</h3>
<p>Xiannüzhen in the Fourth District of this county is an important transportation route between Yangzhou and Taizhou and a major town in our county. Its commerce has always been prosperous, especially the paper and timber industries, which are sold to various counties in northern Jiangsu. Since the flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, it has been greatly affected. The market has plummeted, and its recession has worsened year by year, and there is no way to recover. This year, on New Year's Day, the merchants closed their accounts for the past year, and most of them lost more than they gained. Up to now, the industries have not fully opened, and seven major industries have decided to close down, including Dingfeng and Hengyuan paper stores, Yuanyushunji timber store, Wang Ruiji and Detehe rice stores, and Qiantai southern goods store. There are still several stores whose affairs have not been decided.</p>

<h3>Bengbu: Operational Center of Huainan Coal Mine Shifts to Wuhu</h3>
<p>The Huainan Railway, which has been under construction for several years, officially opened its entire length on the 20th of last month. Currently, from the starting point of Tianjia'an to Chaoxian section, third and fourth-class passenger trains run up and down once a day. However, due to the roadbed of Chaoxian to Yuxikou Jiangbian section is not strong enough, only fourth-class trains are currently running, and passengers are extremely crowded. In recent days, this section has been rushing to lay gravel, and the roadbed is gradually stabilizing. It is scheduled to add coal transportation trains from March 1st to transport as much coal as possible from the Datong and Huainan mines to the Yuxikou area, so as to facilitate sales along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It is now heard that the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau is employing more than a thousand workers to speed up the construction of the riverside wharf at Yuxi Station in order to load and unload coal and goods, and open two docks to facilitate the berthing of small steamships and civilian ships. In Wuhu, a large-scale coal plant is being built for domestic coal use, while the Bengbu office of the Huainan Mine will be scaled down. The director of the Bengbu office, Mei Anlan, has been ordered to go to Wuhu to prepare for the establishment of an office there. In the future, the operational center of the Huainan Mine will be in Wuhu, not Bengbu. The Wuhu office will be the general mechanism for all operations. As for the full-line opening ceremony of the Huainan Railway, it is scheduled to be held on June 5th, the fifth anniversary of the Huainan Coal Mine, at which time people from all walks of life in Beijing, Shanghai, Bengbu, and Wuhu will be invited to participate, in order to show solemnity.</p>

<h3>Three British Air Force Airships: Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that, according to news from the Air Force Committee Office of the British Embassy in China, three British Royal Air Force airships traveling to Japan are scheduled to fly from Manila on February 15th to Hong Kong, fly from Hong Kong to Xiamen on February 18th, spend the night there, and arrive in Shanghai on February 20th, staying until February 23rd before departing for Japan.

<h3>Screening Examination Measures for China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Employees</h3>
<p>Screening to be Handled Separately, Examinations Scheduled to Be Held Regularly.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Issued Measures and Instructions to the Company to Comply With.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications appointed Cai Zengji, Tan Boying, and Lao Mian as general and deputy managers of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, entrusting them with thoroughly reorganizing the company's affairs, and after the Ministry revised and promulgated the company's organizational regulations, the Ministry, in view of the fact that the company currently has too many employees, which does not comply with economic principles, reissued the screening examination measures, and all employees will be subjected to screening examinations in accordance with these measures to determine who will stay and who will leave. According to the person in charge of the company, the company's expenses and personnel management have not yet been rationalized. The screening examination measures for employees issued by the Ministry this time are intended to lay the foundation for reforming the company's affairs based on economic principles. The measures are extremely fair and will be implemented impartially. As for the company's expenses and personnel management, comparisons can be made with similar transportation enterprises to know their rationality. It is heard that the operating scale of a certain Chinese shipping company is comparable to that of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, but the total expenses of the company and its affiliated branch companies are only one-third of those of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This is a comparison of expenses. In terms of personnel, when Zhao Tieqiao was the general manager of the company, the total number of people in the general office was only about 100, but now there are more than 170 people. It is heard that the total number of employees in the head office of the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company is only about 80 people. Compared with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the difference in number is huge, and its business scale is also very large. It can be seen that the company's expenses and personnel management are not in line with economic principles, and it is impossible to talk about rectification without taking tightening policies. This is from the perspective of the interests of state-owned enterprises. If we further observe the common interests of the company's employees, if the company is allowed to continue in this way and does not strive to improve, if the company goes bankrupt due to improper expenses and personnel management, all employees will also lose their jobs. This also conflicts with the interests of the employees themselves. If the skin is not there, where will the hair attach? Killing the chicken to get the eggs is not what the wise do. The company's employees have all received considerable education and understand the truth. They should know that this screening is purely to maintain the company's vitality, and they will certainly be able to understand this and earnestly comply with it. Moreover, each employee is also a member of the nation. In this time of national crisis, serving in the company has the responsibility of safeguarding water transport as a passive aspect, and should plan for the expansion of business as an active aspect. They cannot sit idly by and watch the company's business decline without thinking of saving it. Therefore, after this screening examination, those who pass the examination and are retained should work hard in their respective positions and give full play to their strengths. If they fail the examination and are laid off, they should also endure for the sake of the country and share the difficulties of the times, placing national interests above personal interests. With the qualifications of a citizen and the spirit of selflessness, they should supervise the company's business together with the general public to promote its development, so that the only state-run shipping industry can be maintained and not decline, so as to maintain the unfinished achievements of the pioneers of that year and to live up to the central government's grand hope for economic revival. It is all in this one move. The Ministry of Communications' order and the screening examination measures it issued are recorded below:</p>
<p>Original Text of the Ministry of Communications' Instructions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications instructed the company with the order No. 706 on shipping affairs, which states that the reorganization of the company should be carried out immediately in accordance with the amended organizational regulations, stipulating the number of employees, and holding separate screenings and examinations to determine the superiority and inferiority and determine who will stay and who will leave. The screening examination measures for employees of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have now been formulated, and Wei Ji Jian Yi and, Counselor Ma Xun, members of the Regulations Committee Hu Renyuan, Accountant Lu Rongguang, Chairman of the Employee Affairs Committee Chen Shaoxian, Director of the Navigation Administration Department Lu Lunqin, Chief of the Navigation Affairs Section Ren Jizhong, and Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau Peng Hu will jointly work with the general and deputy managers of the company to preside over the examination. In addition to the examination papers, etc., which have been prepared by the Ministry, the examination venue should be found and arranged by the company, and all employees who are to take the examination should be notified to take the examination at the appointed time. This order is accompanied by a copy of the screening examination measures, which are hereby ordered to be complied with.

<h3>Sino-French Air Route: Officially Opens Today</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Sends Douglas Aircraft to Guangzhou Yesterday for Backup. Guangzhou to Hanoi Can Be Reached in About Four Hours and Forty-Five Minutes</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Sino-French joint transportation route, after the two governments officially signed the "Sino-French Joint Transportation Route Agreement" last year, our government immediately ordered China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) to be responsible for planning the joint transportation route. After receiving the order, CNAC immediately established a route from Guangzhou to Xi Ying (Baise) Hanoi, based on the route surveyed and determined by Mr. Bispei, an American director of the company, and has now been fully completed. It officially opened from Guangzhou today.</p>
<p>Opening Today. The Guangdong-Hanoi route of the Sino-French joint transportation route officially opened in Guangzhou today. CNAC specifically sent a Douglas aircraft from Shanghai yesterday, piloted by American pilot Sai Nas, which took off from Shanghai at 6:30 am yesterday (13th) and arrived in Guangzhou at 3:00 pm. Today at 6:30 am, it was still piloted by the same pilot, officially flying the entire route, arriving in Xi Ying at 8:30 am, reaching Hanoi at 11:15 am, stopping for 45 minutes, and the original aircraft returning at 12:00 noon, arriving back in Guangzhou at 4:40 pm. Every Friday, it will be a round trip, and it will be a regular round trip every day.</p>
<p>Regulations. The fare for the entire Guangdong-Hanoi route has now been set at 100 yuan for a one-way flight from Guangzhou to Xi Ying, 200 yuan for Guangzhou to Hanoi, and 100 yuan for Xi Ying to Hanoi. The round-trip fare is 180 yuan for Guangzhou to Xi Ying, 360 yuan for Guangzhou to Hanoi, and 180 yuan for Xi Ying to Hanoi. Baggage is free of charge, with a weight limit of 15 kilograms. For excess weight, it is one yuan per kilogram from Guangzhou to Xi Ying, two yuan from Guangzhou to Hanoi, and one yuan from Xi Ying to Hanoi. According to company sources, there were no passengers on the opening flight today, only a few postal packages.</p>
<p>French Route. According to Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, regarding the Sino-French joint transportation route, in addition to the Guangdong-Hanoi route being flown by our side, the route from Paris, France, via Marseille, directly to Hanoi, Annam, has been established by the French airline and is flown by French airlines. Because the route passes through the Panama Canal, amphibious aircraft are used to carry passengers and mail. It is now open and connects with our Guangdong-Hanoi route in Hanoi, so the Eurasian route can now be directly reached.</p>

<h3>Telephone Committee Addresses Disguised Price Hikes, Hopes Company Can Increase Basic Call Allowance</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the Shanghai Telephone Company will implement new regulations on March 1st, various organizations in the city, considering the current economic downturn, believe that the new regulations issued by the telephone company are nothing short of a disguised price increase. They convened a joint meeting to strongly advocate against this, and established a Telephone Problem Committee dedicated to research and handling matters related to resisting the disguised price increase. However, after negotiations, no results were achieved. Therefore, the committee is now preparing to take the most effective countermeasures and will soon establish an inquiry team. Equipped with simple questionnaires, the team will set out in different areas to solicit the opinions of users. If they disagree with the new regulations of the telephone company, they will be asked to fill out the form, which will be submitted to the Telephone Problem Committee for compilation. If the Telephone Company disregards the interests of users and implements the new regulations on March 1st, the committee will resort to removing telephones as a countermeasure. Currently, the members of the Telephone Problem Committee hope that the telephone company can make reasonable concessions, such as increasing the basic number of calls included in the monthly rent to 300 or 200. This matter can be temporarily accepted and further studied, in the hope that the telephone company can understand the actual situation of the economic downturn.</p>
<p>Further Negotiations with Authorities Today, Dagong News reports: The Special District Telephone Problem Committee, because the French Municipal Council is scheduled to meet on the 15th to discuss the telephone price increase issue, has appointed committee members Qu Zhenhua, Li Aokui, Li Weiliang, and Zhang Yichen to visit the French Municipal Council again this morning to negotiate and demand the revocation of the approved measures to protect the interests of taxpayers. The letter to the Municipal Council reads as follows: Sirs, the Shanghai Telephone Company's recent revision of the new regulations and fee collection methods will be discussed by your council on the 15th of this month. Holding the principle of loving others with virtue, this committee respectfully presents its deep concerns to your council. The fee-per-call method is not in line with public opinion and is not suitable for the current economic situation. Since the economic downturn began, citizens have been tightening their belts and struggling to cope with the recession. There is no surplus capital for others to exploit. Once the new regulations are implemented, users will likely abandon the service, and reports of phone removal and refusal to pay will become common. The company, disregarding the spirit of weathering the storm together, insists on draining the pond to catch all the fish. When our citizens are pushed to the point of desperation, it may even incite incidents. Wise gentlemen, who are responsible for the security of the special district, will surely be able to plan comprehensively and prevent everyone from going to extremes. We have specially appointed representatives Li Aokui, Qu Zhenhua, Mao Yun, and Zhang Yichen to come forward and explain everything. We hope to be granted an audience.</p>
<p>Suggestions from the Jiangsu Fellow Association: The Jiangsu Shanghai Fellow Association believes that the Shanghai Telephone Company's implementation of a fee-per-call system is tantamount to a disguised price increase. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the Special District Telephone Problem Committee, which reads: Sirs, the Shanghai Telephone Company's change of fee collection methods, which will be implemented on March 1st, is considered by all sectors of the city to be a time when the city's economy is panicked and commerce is extremely depressed. It is already difficult to maintain the status quo, so how can we add to the burden? Therefore, the public's opposition is a well-deserved response. Our association has recently read in the newspapers that various sectors have expressed many opinions on this price increase issue. Upon closer inspection, it is generally believed that the Municipal Council should not have entered into a so-called "official interest of one cent" agreement with the company without soliciting the public opinion of taxpayers. Furthermore, the four-nation telephone experts hired to study the issue should not have placed too much emphasis on the company's unilateral requests. The situation between the two sides has reached an extreme, and without concrete measures, serious disputes are inevitable. For the sake of resolving the dispute, our association proposes two temporary solutions for your consideration: First, before the fee-per-call system is implemented, all users should ask the telephone company to install meters next to each telephone, following the example of electricity and water. The telephone company stipulates 100 calls per month for residential telephones and 150 calls per month for business telephones. For each call exceeding this number, an additional three cents will be charged. This kind of method is really unsuitable for public utilities, but since the situation has become a fait accompli, in order to gain the trust of users, the company should install a meter next to each telephone, just like electricity and water meters, so that for every call made, the meter will increase once. Only after this equipment is complete can people be convinced. As for the previous collection of telephone charges in the Chinese concession, telephone users in the concession sometimes never made calls to the city area, but the company still issued a list and charged users for calls. Although they argued, they were forced to accept the loss due to the pressure of authority. There are many such victims among the special district telephone users. Furthermore, every event has a trial period. Moreover, telephones are a public utility that affects all citizens of the city. Therefore, the competent authorities of the Municipal Council should also pay attention to the interests of all taxpayers. The reasons for the fee-per-call system and the interests of both parties are of great importance. Therefore, before the dispute between the two parties is resolved, a temporary trial period of one month should be implemented to clarify the actual situation. If it is implemented rashly without a specified trial period, the company's profits are still difficult to predict, and the extent of the users' losses cannot be estimated. Therefore, before a satisfactory solution is reached, a temporary trial period of one month should be implemented. As for the current situation where there are not enough meters to install, the company should be asked to postpone the implementation of the new system to avoid disputes. These suggestions are appropriate. We hope that you will discuss them and seek benefits for both parties from a fair standpoint. If the company insists on its original position, then for the sake of the users' interests, we should jointly submit a serious inquiry to the board of directors of the Municipal Council, which represents taxpayers, and demand a clear response. This is respectfully submitted, and we wish you good health.</p>
<h3>All Colleagues of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Plead to Waive Examinations</h3>
<p>To Avoid Unemployment Problems</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, the former manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, repeatedly requested to resign due to the difficulty of reorganizing the company's old debts. The Ministry of Communications approved his resignation and appointed Cai Zengji as the general manager, and Tan Boying and Lao Mian as deputy general managers. They took over on the 10th of this month. The reorganization method started with layoffs based on the principle of screening examinations. This caused panic among all the company's colleagues. They believe that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a commercial institution and that most of its staff have served for many years and have experience. Moreover, all redundant staff have been reduced through several reorganizations. At a time when business is developing, the current staff is already struggling to cope with the heavy workload. In addition, in recent years, operating income has gradually increased, which is the result of both effective guidance and the efforts of the staff. They were hoping to receive promotions and rewards, but unexpectedly, the order for layoffs and examinations was issued, causing panic. Everyone unanimously requested that, although revenue could increase year by year, it was difficult to achieve a balance between income and expenditure due to environmental constraints and debt pressure. The colleagues have served in the company for many years, but have not received any benefits. Thinking of this, how can we not feel sad? Currently, the world is in an economic recession, and all industries are in decline, and our shipping industry is no exception. However, the failure of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's business to develop is not entirely due to the excessive number of personnel or the excessive salaries of the company's staff. There is still a need to promote benefits, eliminate abuses, increase revenue, and reduce expenditure. In terms of the negative aspects, reducing the number of personnel and saving personnel salaries are not the major ways to eliminate abuses and reduce expenditure. The order of priority should be clear to the Ministry (Department, Yuan). The development and stability of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's business, during the implementation of the reorganization plan, may still require the collective efforts and cooperation of the company's original staff to increase efficiency and reduce resistance. The benefits of increasing revenue need not be mentioned. If we do not eliminate the major abuses and reduce the major expenditures, but only take layoffs and salary reductions as an urgent measure, the panic of the people will be enough to affect the business. In the future, there will be more unemployed people, and what will be the impact on social stability and people's livelihood? This need not be said. Article 12 of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's reorganization charter has provisions for the total number of staff. The law is there, and there should be no criticism. However, it is not known whether the number of personnel is sufficient to cope with the company's organization and affairs, and whether the salary budget is suitable for the allocation of income and expenditure. This is often proven by the facts after implementation. If, after the implementation of the entire reorganization plan, the authorities do indeed determine that layoffs are the only way to eliminate abuses and that salary reductions are an urgent way to reduce expenditure, then the screening method can be based on the merits of each individual, and the work can be used as the standard for selection. It does not seem necessary to use an examination system in the short term as a tool for layoffs. The colleagues have served in the company with the aim of protecting the company. The retention of individual positions and the continuation of livelihoods are not worth regretting in the eyes of the authorities. Should we not consider social stability and the business of the company? The colleagues feel that it is dangerous and difficult to remain silent. We dare to risk offending the Ministry (Yuan) and ask the Ministry of Communications to take the state-run shipping industry as its priority and postpone the implementation of layoffs. If layoffs are unavoidable, they should be carried out after the implementation of major measures to eliminate abuses and reduce expenditure, and practical screening methods should be used to avoid the examination system, so as to reassure the people and emphasize the shipping industry. We hope that you will consider our humble plea. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. All colleagues of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company kowtow.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Muslims Discuss Organizing Cemetery Protection Association</h3>
<p>Protest Zhongda Encroaching on Land in Nanjing</p>
<p>Shanghai-based Nanjing Muslims received a letter from Nanjing yesterday, stating that Central University intends to encircle land outside Zhonghua Gate in Shizigang as its campus, which has been filed with the Ministry of Interior.

Muslims are buried naked after death and do not use coffins, so relocation is impossible. Therefore, the Shanghai-based Muslims were greatly alarmed after hearing this news. In the afternoon, they gathered at the Qingzhen Temple in Chuanxin Street to discuss countermeasures. The crowd was indignant and decided on the spot to organize a cemetery protection association and to convene a general assembly of all members to unite and strive to achieve the goal of Central University selecting another site for its campus.</p>

<h3>Stolen Boat on the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Three Thieves Escape Without a Trace</p>
<p>At about 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Xia Bin, patrol officer of the Second Patrol Squad of the Municipal Public Security Water Patrol, led patrolmen Cao Tingting, Ren Changlin, etc., to patrol the surface of the Suzhou Creek at the Tianhou Temple Bridge when they saw a civilian boat parked there with suspicious signs. As the police were about to go forward for inspection, the three thieves on the boat heard the alarm, abandoned the boat and went ashore, fleeing into the crowd without a trace. The original boat was then taken to the team for investigation, and items such as a pistol-like safety belt and six iron bars were found on the boat. They have been transferred to the headquarters for investigation. The China Travel Service of this city organized two plum blossom viewing groups this month. For the Hangzhou Chaoshan plum blossom viewing group, the departure date is set for the 16th of this month, and they will return to Shanghai that evening. For the Suzhou Dengwei plum blossom viewing group, the departure date is set for the 22nd of this month, and they will return to Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd. It is reported that the number of people who have signed up for the company recently is extremely enthusiastic, and there are not many places left.

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Jiangnan Railways to Implement Interline Transportation</h3>
<p>The construction of the interline transportation station on the three railways has been largely completed. The Ministry of Railways convened a meeting to decide on the implementation next month. Xin Xin News reports: The Jiangnan Railway's connecting line with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is about to be completed. The Ministry of Railways has recently convened the responsible personnel of the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Jiangnan Railways to discuss interline transportation methods, and agreements have largely been reached. The Jiangnan Railway is currently rushing to complete the work.

<h3>New Locomotives for Two Railways Shipped from England to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Currently Being Unloaded, Test Run Soon</p>
<p>Riri News reports: The locomotives of the 4-8-4 type, rented by the two railways from the Yuehan Railway, were manufactured in the UK. After personnel were sent to the factory to negotiate, the locomotives arrived in Wusong from England yesterday. They were loaded onto two cargo ships. Unloading will begin today. These locomotives are the largest of the existing locomotives in China, weighing 106 tons each. They will soon be assembled and tested at the Wusong airport. After these locomotives are put into use, the speed of the two railways will be further increased. It is also reported that another six identical locomotives will be shipped from England to Qingdao for unloading next month, and another eight will be shipped to Guangzhou next year. These locomotives were purchased by the Chinese government from the Boxer Indemnity funds.</p>
<h3>Post Office Orders Various Administrations to Subscribe to Publications on Behalf of Others</h3>
<p>So that the Public Can Read Publications More Conveniently</p>
<p>Xin Xin News reports: Since the Post Office began subscribing to publications on behalf of others, people in various places have found it very convenient. However, subscribers who reside in places where there is no post office, but only a postal agency or village and town letterbox, must entrust relatives or stores in the location of the post office where they subscribe to collect and forward their publications. Those who do not have relatives or stores to forward their publications will inevitably encounter difficulties. It is reported that the Directorate General of Posts has instructed all postal administrations that, in the future, if they encounter members of the public who reside in places with postal agencies or village and town letterboxes asking the post office to subscribe to publications on their behalf, the publications can be forwarded to the relevant agencies or letterboxes and delivered to the address when they are sent by the publisher to the post office where they subscribe. It is not necessary for subscribers to ask someone to collect and forward their publications in the location of the post office, so that it will be more convenient for people in the interior to subscribe to publications.</p>
<h3>New Developments in Gu Zhuxuan Case: Prosecutor Goes to Bank to Investigate</h3>
<p>Two More Prisoners Accuse Guards of Smuggling Opium for Gu to Smoke; Court Searches Gu's Hospital Room and Finds Some Evidence</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao were arrested by the French Concession police after being denounced for inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. They were indicted by the Special Second Court. Dissatisfied with the Second Special Court's sentence of imprisonment, both defendants appealed to the High Third Branch Court. After the final arguments of the appeal, it was discovered that Gu Zhuxuan had bribed the guards and the director of the Special Second Prison's ward at Guangci Hospital to persuade the original accusers, Zhao and Zhang, to retract their previous statements in the hope of escaping punishment. As a result, the guards Ma Xiancai and Ma Xianxiang (brothers) and the director Wang Yucai fled for fear of punishment. The High Third Branch Court ordered the detention of the incumbent guards Jia Furong and Wang Bogang, who were suspected of involvement, pending investigation. At the same time, it ordered the Special Second Court to issue arrest warrants to be handed over to the French Police Department to pursue the fugitive Ma brothers, and the case was handed over to the Special Second Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling. This has been reported in this newspaper for several days. It is now learned that the Chief Prosecutor of the Special Second Court, accompanied by Clerk Peng Xu, went to the Daya Bank at 19 Tianjin Road on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, with the passbooks in the case, to investigate the source of the deposits with senior bank staff. It is said that bank employee Li Changyuan handled the deposit of two bank drafts from a money exchange, one for 1,000 yuan and one for 2,000 yuan, totaling 3,000 yuan, and opened a current account under the name of Zhang Sen. The prosecutor inquired about the appearance and age of the depositor, but because the handling bank employee Li Changyuan was on leave for some business, a thorough investigation could not be made. The prosecutor wanted to take the deposit seal back to the court for verification, but the bank requested that the original seal be sent to the court after a photograph was taken for record. As a result, the two guard directors Wang Bogang, who are currently detained, are related to the bribery case, and Jia Furong was accused by the prisoners Li Heshang and Guo Shanyu of smuggling opium and morphine and other contraband for Gu Zhuxuan to smoke. A search was conducted in Gu's detention room, and some evidence was found. The Special Second Court Prosecutor's Office originally planned to hold a court hearing yesterday to investigate the two guards in custody. However, because the responsible Prosecutor Wang Ren had to retrieve the original case files of Gu and Wang from the High Third Branch Court for verification, the High Third Branch Court transferred the case files to the Special Second Court Prosecutor's Office in the afternoon. Because it took time to review the case files, the investigation court could not be opened. The interrogation should be able to proceed today or tomorrow. The inside story of the new facts is gradually unfolding.</p>

<h3>Silk Manufacturers in This City Should Establish a Rayon Factory</h3>
<p>Representative Wang Yansong Presented to the Government; Minister of Finance Kong Also Agreed to Help</p>
<p>Silk manufacturers in this city find that rayon is used in large quantities, but our country does not yet have a dedicated factory to manufacture it ourselves. The products needed by each factory are all imported. When Mr. Wang of the Golden Silk Factory went to Beijing the other day, he presented a report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, requesting review and implementation, and personally met with Minister of Finance Kong, requesting assistance. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry is considering the factory establishment funds, and Minister of Finance Kong has also agreed to do his best to find ways to assist. The results of the negotiations are very satisfactory. The factory establishment plan proposed by the association is now recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Amount of Funds: The total capital of the factory is tentatively set at 10 million national currency, with the government and businesses contributing half each. The government's share of 5 million yuan will be allocated by the government. The business share of 5 million yuan will be raised in the domestic silk weaving industry first, or by issuing corporate bonds. As for the distribution of dividends, the government's share should be lower than the business share to show the government's guidance.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Organization: It should be a joint-stock company. Government-owned directors and supervisors will be selected from among the business shareholders. The selection of directors and supervisors can be decided temporarily according to future needs.</p>
<p>Factory Location: After the Hangzhou-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Wuzha Railway, and the Five-Province Highway are all completed, Hangzhou will leap to become the transportation hub of the southern provinces. In terms of waterways, it will be possible to reach overseas directly from Ningbo, connect the inland through the canal, and connect the Yangtze River Basin through the Qiantang River. Transportation will be very convenient. If the Oriental Port in Premier Sun Yat-sen's plan can be completed, Hangzhou's status will be even better than Shanghai. Furthermore, Hangzhou has not yet developed into an industrial and commercial port area, and land prices and labor costs are very low. There are also large quantities of pine wood in western Zhejiang and southern Anhui that can be harvested, and low-priced power from the Hangzhou Power Plant can be used. It is an ideal factory location. If the factory site can be selected at Zhakou or its opposite bank, it will be very convenient for the procurement and transportation of raw materials, the export of products, and the supply of water and electricity.</p>
<p>Technical Talent: The manufacturing process of rayon is very complicated. In the beginning, foreign talent must be temporarily borrowed to achieve quick results. However, at the same time, outstanding students from the chemistry and textile departments of domestic universities must be selected and sent to Europe, the United States, and Japan to study rayon manufacturing, dyeing, and other technologies, and introduced to famous rayon companies in various countries for internships, so that they can practically assume manufacturing responsibilities after returning to the country, and achieve the goal of using domestic talent and domestic raw materials to produce national rayon products.</p>
<p>Reward for Products: At the beginning of establishment, the reputation may not yet be established, and the products may not yet be refined. For the sake of encouragement, the government should grant a patent for 20 years to prevent improper domestic competition. At the same time, import duties on foreign rayon should be heavily levied to prevent them from being devalued and dumped in our country. In addition, it is proposed to grant a 20-year tax exemption for domestic rayon and reduce the preferential treatment of water and land freight to reduce production costs to the lowest possible limit, and achieve the goal of domestic and foreign adoption. Sales: Since the import of foreign rayon has been established for many years, there is no reason for slow sales of factory products. For the sake of advocacy, it is proposed that the government issue a circular to national people's organizations, instructing the textile industry to adopt them uniformly to achieve the initial goal of national production and national sales. Once the factory is consolidated and the products are excellent, it will then be exported to foreign countries to compete in the world market to complete the final goal of national production and foreign sales.</p>
<h3>The Southern District Rent Reduction Committee Petitions the Local Court</h3>
<p>Do Not Allow Landlords to Exercise Provisional Attachment Based on One-Sided Applications</p>
<p>The Shanghai Southern District Rent Reduction Committee held an executive and supervisory committee meeting yesterday at the committee's auditorium on Qinglian Street, Luxiang Garden Road, Nine Mu Land. It was decided that the court, in order to take care of the overall situation, pays close attention to rental cases involving arrears of rent. Therefore, many recent rulings have been made to reduce rent. However, due to unclear procedures, tenants are sued for arrears of rent due to rent reduction, and some are even subject to provisional execution by landlords who provide security. The committee specially petitioned the courts yesterday, the original petition recorded as follows: In the case where the committee has sent a letter to the landlord and has not been resolved in accordance with the law, all rents during the rental period have been deposited in the bank in accordance with the committee's charter. As for the previous arrears, they should be reduced after the rent reduction is completed. After the statement is made that the rent will be returned in moderation, if the landlord disregards commercial difficulties, destroys rent reduction, and accuses the rent as debt and applies for compulsory execution of provisional attachment by providing security, it should be rejected. Otherwise, the concealing person shall be fully liable for all losses and disputes arising therefrom, in order to maintain rent reduction and save people's lives. To love the people and reduce litigation is the good advice of law enforcement, and simple politics and clear punishment are the grand situation of Zhizhi. Morality is to prevent problems before they occur, and the law is to sanction after the fact. If the truth and falsehood can be distinguished and black and white can be distinguished, then cunning people will not dare to file lawsuits at every turn, and weak people can also arbitrate their grievances to the fullest extent. The original intention of national legislation is more than half achieved. This committee responds to the needs of the facts</p>
<h3>The German Manager of the Mei Feng Bank Was Accused of Embezzlement; Continued Hearing</h3>
<p>The defendant shirks his responsibility to the comprador Huang Yicai; Lei Wen testified in court that Zhu Yousong handled everything</p>
<p>Gray Fufushi, the German vice chairman and general manager of the closed Mei Feng Bank, was sued for changing Yang Xiqing's 20,000 yuan and Russian Yibude's 12,000 yuan of cash into notice deposits, committing crimes of fraud, breach of trust, and embezzlement. On Tuesday afternoon of this week, the First Special District Local Court held a court hearing and ordered the defendant to post a 20,000 yuan bond to be released from custody pending trial. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Now, the defense lawyers of Ge Shi, Chen Tingrui, Gao Luman, and Lu Dingxiong, have detailed the content and facts of the case, as well as the reasons why he should not be responsible, in a defense statement, pointing out that it was the trick of Huang Yicai, the comprador of Mei Feng Bank (that is, Wang Yisui recorded in the previous report). Since the collapse of Mei Feng, he assisted accounting clerk Huo</p>
<p>Clean Up Accounts: He believes that he has not been derelict in his duties during his tenure at Mei Feng, and there are no debt entanglements. He requests to supplement witnesses in order to clarify the truth and avoid miscarriage of justice. Yesterday afternoon, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, held a continued hearing. First, Lawyer Chen requested a moment to state the facts and reasons for the defense, so that it would be clearer. The court approved it. Lawyer Chen then stated each of the defenses one by one, saying that at the previous court hearing, the police lawyer compared the judgment telegram of the American Inspectorate's White Lang case with this case, saying that this case was exactly the same as that case, intending to make the judgment of this case use that case as a precedent, so he made this "predecessor's words". It is a pity that there are very few cases that are exactly the same, and the facts of other cases can never be used as the basis for this case, and the criminality of the defendant in other cases cannot be used as the standard for whether the defendant in this case is guilty or not. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the court will deal with the matter on a case-by-case basis, without comparison, without miscarriage of justice, in order to obtain legal fairness. The police lawyer stated that since the defendant held the position of general manager of the bank, the change of the entrusted funds into notice deposits was initiated by the defendant, and although the illegal benefit belonged to Mei Feng, the defendant could not but bear his responsibility. However, although the defendant was the general manager, he only oversaw the bank's affairs in general, and could not advise on every ordinary matter. All matters initiated by the defendant must be</p>
<p>The defendant's signature: The defendant's order shall be followed, and the lawful order of the defendant and the general manager shall be obeyed. If the change of the name of the funds is the defendant's claim, it is an illegal act and there is no need to obey it. It has now been found that these two deposits were not only embezzled by the defendant, but also not received by Mei Feng. The beneficiary was the comprador Huang Yicai. On April 7 last year, there was more than 103,000 yuan of deposits in the comprador's account. The next day, Yang Xiqing sent the funds for safekeeping. On that day, the deposit balance in the comprador's account increased by 20,000, which clearly shows that the increase was Yang's</p>
<p>20,000 Cash: On April 30, the Russian Yibude Daily was less. The accounts for those two days show that the deposits were all more than 150,000 yuan. This 12,000 yuan was also not withdrawn. On May 24, when Mei Feng collapsed, there were still more than 108,000 yuan of deposits in the comprador's account, which should have been returned to Mei Feng, but Huang Yicai has not delivered it to date. Therefore, these two batches of entrusted funds, totaling 32,000 yuan, are still in Huang's possession. The defendant must also request that the accounting clerk be summoned to court to provide evidence. The defendant's words are all facts.</p>
<p>Copy of Accounts, etc.: To refute, saying that the wording of his defense statement is unavoidable and does not involve the scope of this case. The bank can sue Huang Yicai for the money he owes the bank. If there is criminal suspicion, the police will also handle it according to law. The court then summoned Mei Feng's deputy manager Lei Wen to testify. According to Lei Wen, he is responsible for all responsibilities of the custody department. He signed the custody receipt held by Yang Xiqing, and all custody procedures were handled by Zhu Yousong. On April 8 last year, Yousong came to Gong Maiban, a friend of Huang Yicai, Yang Xiqing, with 20,000 cash</p>
<p>Deposit for Safekeeping: Since the safekeeping of cash was a new venture, the funds were deposited in the vault at will. After the bank collapsed, there was only a "notice deposit" receipt in the vault, which was incomprehensible. Because of the busy affairs, he did not go to the vault to inspect at that time, because he firmly believed that Zhu would never make mistakes and did not investigate in detail. Yibude also asked Xian Lai to make it clear when he proposed to withdraw a portion of the deposit as a custody fund, and after he asked Yi, he agreed to accommodate him. Yi then signed a check and gave it to Zhu.</p>
<p>Withdraw Money and Deposit in Vault: There are two inspections every year, but last year, when the defendant came to visit, he said that the valuables in the vault had become a "notice deposit" receipt, and then he found out. What Zhu Changting said the day before yesterday was purely a lie. Mei Feng Maiban is the highest authority of Chinese employees, and has the right to handle Chinese deposits without first asking the defendant for instructions. The police lawyer then refuted the witness for a long time. The court then questioned Zhu Yousong, who testified that Yang and others</p>
<p>Notice Deposits: The receipt was rejected by the deposit department staff member surnamed Cai, that is, he refused to sign it on the account to prove it. Later, after the defendant personally explained the reason, Xin began to sign it. This person is said to have returned to Germany. The court then questioned the defendant Gray Fufu, with translator Jiang Baoliang acting as interpreter. According to the testimony, Xin Musheng was a trainee at Mei Feng Bank, only seventeen or eighteen years old, and was never sent to check Zhu Yousong's account. He was only responsible for verifying the inventory, that is, my responsibility for reconciling the bookkeeping. At that time, because I saw that the account book recorded the notice deposit account, and the inventory was the notice deposit receipt, I thought that</p>
<p>Two-Phase Compliance: So he signed on the book, because he did not know Huang Yicai, and showed him the account copied by the defendant. Huang admitted that he owed Mei Feng a total of 110,000 yuan, but he had collateral worth 105,000 yuan deposited in Mei Feng. According to the defendant, the collateral deposited by Dong was 10,000 US dollars of Mei Feng Bank stock. Now that Mei Feng has collapsed, the stock is worthless, but what Huang owes is cash. When Judge Qian asked this, it was already late, so he ordered the hearing to be postponed to Thursday afternoon next week.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhiyun Sues Tang Jishan for 10,000 Yuan in Damages</h3>
<p>Zhang Herself Has Gone to Perform in the South Seas; Unable to Pay Litigation Costs, She Asks for Legal Aid</p>
<p>Last year, a sensational case occurred in this city, that is, the movie star Ruan Lingyu and Tang Jishan, the manager of the Hua Tea Company, were sued by Zhang Damin in the Second Special Court for obstructing family and embezzlement. While the case was in progress, Ruan Lingyu suddenly committed suicide by poisoning because of public opinion. At that time, newspapers competed to report it, causing a sensation. As a result, Tang Jishan was found not guilty. Zhang Damin was dissatisfied and filed an appeal. The appeal has been concluded after three trials, and Zhang has lost all cases. Unexpectedly, Tang Jishan was recently sued by movie and dance star Zhang Zhiyun through a lawyer to the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering Tang to compensate 200,000 yuan for the damages stipulated in the contract. Tang Jishan met Zhang Zhiyun several years ago and began living together. Their relationship was quite good. Later, because Zhang Zhiyun found out that Tang already had a wife, she negotiated with him. At that time, in order to please Zhang Zhiyun, Tang made a contract stating that he would give 200,000 yuan. Later, Zhang and Tang had a rift and separated immediately. It is rumored that when they separated, Tang gave Zhang 10,000 yuan. After that, Tang had an affair with Ruan Lingyu and lived together, while Zhang Zhiyun also made a living on her own and once had a lawsuit with lawyer Zhou Xiaobo in the First Special Court. Recently, Zhang sued Tang Jishan in civil court based on the previous contract, requesting compensation of 200,000 yuan, and because Zhang's situation has been poor recently and her economy is tight, she is unable to pay the litigation costs, so she requests legal aid. Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, Judge Cao Jun presided over the twelfth civil court hearing. The defendant Tang Jishan did not appear, and lawyer Yan Xiongfei appeared in court to respond to the lawsuit. Lawyer Gu, the agent of Zhang Zhiyun, immediately stated that Zhang herself had left with the song and dance troupe to perform song and dance in the South Seas due to livelihood problems, with a monthly salary of 700 yuan and a contract period of six months. The contract has not yet expired, so she cannot appear in court. However, Zhang's current situation is indeed difficult. Even her Shanghai residence has been sealed because the issued check could not be cashed. Therefore, it is impossible to raise the litigation costs for this case, and she requests legal aid. Judge Cao said that Zhang Zhiyun used to be a movie star with a great reputation, so she would not be so poor. Lawyer Gu also said that Zhang is indeed without money, and has been repeatedly sued by fashion companies and jewelry companies for a small amount of money, and has been publicized in newspapers, which has greatly damaged her reputation. A group of friends are unwilling to help her, etc. Judge Cao ordered the case to be postponed and investigated further before reviewing it. It is necessary to establish the Shanghai Municipal District Rent Reduction Committee to proceed with a pure purpose in peaceful measures. It has been a year since then. The details have been invited by your court to know. Therefore, shops and households in various lanes and neighborhoods that cannot bear the burden of high rents have organized rent reduction branches one after another. This shows that the market is depressed and the land value is declining. Reducing rent is the urgent task to save the city. In addition to the express provisions of Article 442 of the Civil Code, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Committee of the National Government is concerned about the people's suffering and pays attention to rent reduction, and approved this committee (see Approval No. 1367). It has been discussed repeatedly in the Executive Yuan meetings. On the 12th of this month, the Executive, Finance, and Industrial ministries and courts were convened to discuss the Shanghai rental dispute. However, the rent reduction case is a conflict of interests between the landlord and the tenant, resulting in repeated disputes and lawsuits in court. The landlord can hire lawyers to defend in various ways, while the tenant is unable to defend due to various reasons, such as economic exhaustion, resulting in emotional obscurity. Among them, some landlords, in order to stop the rent reduction, disregard commercial difficulties, and use economic power to provide security, accusing the rent as debt, and applying for compulsory execution of provisional attachment, etc. This is an act of destroying the commercial market and suppressing rent reduction. Therefore, I specially present it to your court, requesting your attention and rejecting the application. After the statement that all rents payable before the rent reduction dispute is resolved in accordance with the charter of the committee, if the landlord ignores the facts and applies for compulsory execution of provisional attachment, the losses suffered by each tenant and other oblique disputes arising therefrom must be fully compensated by the landlord, in order to maintain the market situation. I am grateful to Deping and protect the Shanghai Local Court.</p>
<h3>Veterinarian at Municipal Zoo Discovers Anthrax Bacteria</h3>
<p>Using Flame Thrower to Spray Animal Pens</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the tiger kept in the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road died of lung disease last year, which has been reported in the newspapers. At the same time, a panther also died of illness last year. However, the fatal symptoms of the panther were found to have anthrax bacteria in the blood after blood was drawn and tested by a veterinarian from the Municipal Health Bureau. Therefore, it was determined that it died of anthrax. However, the disease is highly contagious. Once infected, it can be fatal within a few days. Therefore, the zoo is very careful. The animals kept in the zoo must be checked once a day. Recently, due to the arrival of spring, the weather has been cold and hot, and the bacteria have suddenly been discovered again in the animals in the zoo. In order to prevent problems, a flame thrower is urgently used to spray each animal pen in order to kill the bacteria.</p>
<h3>Former Jiaotong University Professor Jin Tongyi: Wife Sues for Divorce</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Mediation Failed</p>
<p>Jin Tongyi, also known as You Liu, a 32-year-old Shanghai native currently residing at Ping'an Li, Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, who once served as the Chief of the First Section of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a professor at Jiaotong University, married Li Qingzheng (same age as Jin), a native of Baoshan County, on January 14th, 1933 at the Puyi Agency's Tiyang Hall on Guling Road. Initially, their love was harmonious, but after half a year, their relationship suddenly deteriorated. Jin, claiming Li was poor at socializing, threatened her to sign a document stating they could be free and their marriage could become a friendship. After Li refused, Jin became even more indifferent. When Jin was teaching at Jiaotong University in Hongkou, Li Qingzheng went to the school to get his clothes, but Jin refused to see him. Li was forced to hire lawyer Yu Zhongluo to file a suit with the Second Special District Court's Civil Division, requesting an order for cohabitation. At that time, Jin was traveling in Japan, and only sent a lawyer to court to respond. After repeated hearings and investigations, the two parties reached an out-of-court settlement, and Jin took Li home to live together. However, their relationship remained strained. Later, Jin went to Nanjing for a job, and Li followed him. Li discovered in the police station's household register that her husband had married Liu Hailan (also known as Liu Xufen, formerly a student at Soochow University) from Changzhou in Nanjing and was living with her, and they had a child. Li then sought assistance from the Nanjing Women's Association. Jin even used illegal methods to harm Li, which was reported to the Nanjing Police Department, and Jin and Liu were arrested and transferred to the court. They were later released on bail. Recently, Jin's wife, Li Qingzheng, filed for divorce from Jin Tongyi, citing adultery and inability to continue living together, and initially requested a separation and alimony, which was unsuccessful. Li then hired lawyer Chen Yaodong to file a suit with the Second Special District Court's Civil Division, requesting mediation for divorce from Jin Tongyi and an order for alimony of 150 yuan per month until the age of 60, totaling 50,400 yuan, as well as 10,000 yuan for emotional distress, and the return of a 3,000 yuan diamond ring and over ten pieces of clothing worth 500 yuan. The court, upon receiving the petition, scheduled a mediation hearing yesterday morning at 10:00 am, presided over by Judge Li Liang of the Fourth Civil Division. The petitioner, Jin Li, was in Nanjing and was represented by a lawyer. The respondent, Jin Tongyi, did not appear and did not send a lawyer.

<h3>After the Death of Li Jingfang, Inheritance Disputes are Raging</h3>
<p>Yang Yunshi's Children, as Li Jingfang's Grandchildren, Claim Inheritance Rights of 500,000</p>
<p>Li Jingfang, courtesy name Boxing, a former Qing Dynasty loyalist who died in Dalian in late autumn of the year before last, had disposed of his family property during his lifetime and established a will for his descendants, hoping to avoid inheritance disputes after his death. However, those who did not receive a share are still fighting. For example, a concubine of Li filed a lawsuit against Li's son, Guo Tao, etc., last winter, seeking support expenses. That case is still in the second instance. Now, Li's grandchildren, Yang Cheng, etc., have filed a suit against his descendants in the First Special District Court, seeking division of property. The eldest daughter of Boxing, Guo Xiang, was the first wife of Yang Yunshi (name Qi), who once served in Wu Peifu's staff, and gave birth to children Yang Cheng, Yang Yin, Yang Quan'yin, Yang Chong'yin, Yang Man'yin, etc. Chong'yin and Man'yin are already married. Now, her five siblings claim that after their maternal grandfather Boxing died, his estate of over 8 million was divided among Li's sons Guo Tao, Guo Xiao, Guo Yun, Guo Hua, Li's grandson Jia Ji, Li's sons-in-law Pan Yaodong, Wu Longhe, etc., and their mother's rightful share, Guo Xiang, was swallowed by these people. Feeling resentful, they hired lawyer Lin Biao to sue Guo Tao, etc., in the First Special District Court, claiming that their mother and the defendants were first-in-line heirs. Although their mother has passed away, according to the interpretation of the Judiciary Yuan, each plaintiff has the right to inherit by representation and should receive one-eighth of Boxing's entire estate, approximately over one million. However, the defendants colluded with Zhou Mengwen and created a will when Boxing was seriously ill, and did not allow the full text of the will to be published. The plaintiffs only saw fragments and therefore have doubts. In order to protect their legally obtained inheritance rights, they are temporarily calculating based on the estimated 8 million yuan of the estate, of which the special portion is over 4 million yuan. The plaintiffs have the right to inherit one-eighth, requesting a judgment to distribute 500,000 yuan and ordering the defendants to pay the litigation costs. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang held a hearing, but none of the seven defendants appeared. They hired a lawyer to appear in court and raise jurisdictional issues, which the plaintiff's lawyer debated. Wu Longhe, because he is the Chief Accountant of the Wuxi County Government, sent a representative to the case, stating that Wu had not received any inheritance and shared the same regret as the plaintiffs. The court, stating that the case required further investigation, ordered a postponement.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Announces to Opium Smokers: Limited Time to Exchange for Official Licenses</h3>
<p>Comply Promptly Before the End of This Month; Licenses Will Be Cancelled If Not Claimed by the Deadline</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau announced this morning: "The opium smoker registration process has been completed by this bureau. All ordinary and poor people's licenses that should be issued have been filled out and distributed to various sub-bureaus for investigation and distribution, as announced in the Proclamation No. 105. All opium smokers who registered and held temporary receipts from July to November of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) must bring their receipts to the original registration office to exchange for official licenses within the month of December. Now that the opium smoker registration has been completed on December 31st, 1935, according to the order, there are still many opium smokers who have not come to exchange for their licenses. Therefore, it is hereby announced that all those who have applied for registration at the sub-bureaus or this bureau before December 31st of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), and those who have been ordered to register by this bureau, must bring their temporary receipts to the original registration office before the end of this month to exchange for official licenses. If they fail to claim their licenses by the deadline, the licenses and temporary receipts will be cancelled. They must all comply and not delay any further." This announcement.</p>
<h3>Record of the Bean and Rice Industry Association Meeting</h3>
<p>Clarifying Facts to Avoid Misunderstandings</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bean and Rice Industry Association held a meeting at the Cuixiu Hall in the city. The chairman reported: "According to reports from fellow traders, it was read in the newspaper that the members of the Rice Industry Association held a meeting at the Tongxing Restaurant, opposing the rebate treatment of the rice industry and the two-day delay in opening the holds. The words were one-sided and sensationalist, causing misunderstandings. Therefore, a meeting of northern and southern traders was convened. The proposal in the newspaper was submitted to the public for discussion. Everyone said that the industry rules of the traders stipulate rebates. Those who clear payments within five days receive a 6% rebate. Those who clear payments at the end of the month receive a 3% rebate. Those who do not clear payments at the end of the month receive no rebate. This has been approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Fearing that traders may violate the rules, the old agreements are reiterated without any changes. This rebate treatment can be said to be generous, so most trading firms have no complaints. If there are a few trading firms that misunderstand, you can explain it politely. In case of extra demands that seek to undermine the industry rules, it is hoped that everyone will insist. Traders who violate the rules will be punished according to the resolutions. As for the two main reasons for the delay in opening the holds, there are few ships arriving from the river. In view of the small number of sales after the big closing, the stores still have a thick stock of rice. Delaying the opening of the holds by two days is enough to supply the needs and does not hinder the common people. In addition, the traders were deeply burdened by the arrears and bad debts owed by some trading firms last year. In this time of tight finances, we must take precautions and be extra cautious. The above two items are obvious facts, and there is no reason for misunderstandings to occur. It is hoped that all traders will abide by the industry rules and resolutions." The meeting adjourned at 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Total Expenditure of Over 16,000 Legal Tender Yuan</p>
<p>Members of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, including Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Gu Xinyi, etc., in view of the frequent disasters in recent years, rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial depression, and the increase in ordinary people and unemployed workers after the January 28th Incident, who are without clothes and food, and in an unbearable situation, decided to establish temporary shelters early on December 1st of last year at the Chaozhou Guild Hall and the Chao Hui Mountain Villa in the Nanshi district, housing a total of over 3,400 ordinary people, mostly refugees who came to Shanghai from disaster-stricken provinces, mainly Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, followed by Henan and Shandong, and a large number of unemployed poor people in the city, followed by the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans. The daily requirement for rice alone is more than 20 stones. The operation has been going on for more than two months, and Zhang Zixin has been diligently and responsibly in charge of all matters of management and supply. Although the weather is now entering spring, it is still very cold, and the people leaving the shelter still have no means of livelihood. Therefore, there are still more than 2,000 people staying in the shelter. After discussions among the various committees, it was decided to wait for the weather to warm up before setting a date for closing the shelter. The expenses of the shelter rely entirely on the efforts of Chairman Wang and others to raise funds and their enthusiastic support. They have received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, including 2,000 yuan from the municipal government, 2,000 yuan from Minister Kong, 4,000 yuan from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, 1,000 yuan from the water and drought relief associations of various provinces, 2,000 yuan from Lin Bingyan, and donations from various charitable organizations and enthusiastic philanthropists, totaling over 10,000 yuan. From the start date to February 10th of this year, a total of over 11,000 national currency yuan has been received. The concern for the poor and the enthusiasm are commendable. Director Zhang has strived to economize on the shelter's expenses. According to the administrators, Tan Xiaotian and Xie Youzhu, each disbursement is publicly audited and reported, and a transcript is as follows: A total of 17,282.83 national currency yuan has been received from Chairman Wang in batches. The expenses include: 6,973.38 yuan for the poor's rice, with Gu donating rice, the poor's vegetable oil and fuel totaling 5,705.12 yuan. Each poor person requires "x jiao" per day, which is contracted by the kitchen. The salaries of the staff and workers in December and January totaled 770.75 yuan. The food expenses for the staff were 305.35 yuan. The construction of the two shelter sheds, dining hall, kitchen, bedroom, etc., cost 719 yuan. The decoration and equipment of the two shelters cost 631.29 yuan. The transportation costs for carrying rice, clothing, etc. were 344.14 yuan. Stationery and paper cost 22.13 yuan. The consumption of firewood, coal, straw paper, etc. was 347.2 yuan. Miscellaneous expenses were 416.02 yuan. The second shelter spent 27.22 yuan on miscellaneous items. The renovation of old cotton quilts cost 557.4 yuan. As of January 31st of this year, a total of 16,819 national currency yuan has been spent. All receipts and disbursements have been carefully audited and reported by the accountant. It is said that there are still many poor people staying at the shelter.

<p>A. First, raise a half-cent in cash. The payment will be made one month after the reconciliation is established and ruled.</p>
<p>B. The remaining 10% will be repaid in two years, i.e., "half a cent will be repaid at the end of December 1936 as the first installment" and "half a cent will be repaid at the end of December 1937 as the second installment." This payment will be secured by all the machinery and equipment of Tong Yutai and the accounts receivable, or by representatives elected by the creditors to supervise, settle the accounts once a month, and review all accounts.</p>

<h3>President Jiang's Speech at the Central Political School: The Way of Learning and Establishing a Career for Youth (II)</h3>
<p>Secondly, everyone must understand that many of the things I have just said are only to explain the revolutionary responsibilities that everyone should bear and to indicate a correct path for becoming a person and establishing a career. As for taking on these responsibilities, striving forward along a rational path, and achieving our ideals, we still need everyone to be able to work hard, diligently practice, and persevere to the end, that is, to establish a great ambition to save the country and the people, to have a spirit of self-reliance and self-government, to constantly eliminate all the bad habits and evil thoughts of the old order, thereby changing temperament, improving morality, and completing the cultivation of personality. Now that you are studying at school, the cultivation of all knowledge and learning should, of course, take the teachers as models and sincerely accept the teachings of the teachers. However, for a person's learning and morality to achieve true success and to establish an outstanding personality, it completely depends on oneself. Even wise parents, elder brothers, and good teachers and helpful friends can only guide and supervise from the side, and the power of this kind of guidance and supervision is also very limited. It can be said that if a person is to truly succeed in establishing a career, it completely depends on whether he can be ambitious, self-governing, and self-reliant. The ancients said, "Learning begins with setting ambitions," "Self-improvement never ceases," "Be cautious when alone and preserve sincerity," and "Restrain oneself and return to propriety," all of which mean this. Whether or not our education can have an effect depends on whether or not it can enable students to develop this kind of self-reliant and self-governing personality. Every student should know that whether or not all of his future learning and career will be successful depends only on whether or not he now has a spirit of self-reliance and the ability to self-govern. Therefore, although the education in our school adopts strict military-style management methods, in spirit, we must pay special attention to personality education, to cultivate students' spirit and ability of automatic, self-governing, self-reliant, and independent, and to create a truly revolutionary personality. We generally want every student to be able to manage themselves without being managed, to be good without being taught, to be independent without being helped, and to be successful without being forced. If our education reaches this point and the students' self-cultivation reaches this level, then the power of this spirit and personality will be greater than any power. If we have this power, even without guns and cannons, foreigners will not only not dare to invade and oppress us at will, but also not dare not respect us. The reason why we are now being invaded and oppressed by others at will is because we cannot be self-reliant and independent. This is the reason why the ancients said, "People must insult themselves before others insult them." Therefore, the first thing we hope for from our subordinates and students is not to have great learning and talent, but to be a person who respects, governs, strengthens, and relies on themselves, especially to be a Chinese person, and to know the principles of being a Chinese person, which is to first have the cultivation of Chinese ethics, that is, parents should be loving to their children, children should be filial to their parents, teachers should love their students, and students should respect their teachers. In short, at any time and in any place, we must understand propriety, know shame, value ethics, and abide by discipline, which is to have our students of the political school first restore our Chinese inherent virtues of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace." Only in this way can we be considered a true Chinese person, and then all of our intelligence and talent can be used for the country and the nation. Now, although our political school has such a good spirit and discipline, we must not be complacent and satisfied with ourselves. We must continue to develop the spirit of self-improvement and seek further progress. Moreover, it is not only our school that needs to be good, but we must also create an atmosphere of understanding propriety, knowing shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by discipline, so that the atmosphere of all universities in the country can be changed, and only then can we achieve the goal of establishing a modern new China. Finally, I want to talk about the practical efforts of our self-government and self-reliance. Simply put, we must start from our daily habits, move towards goodness when we see it, and correct our mistakes when we have them. We must be able to completely eliminate all the old habits of decadence, corruption, romance, selfishness, and all kinds of bad thoughts and actions. As a result of this daily progress, we can naturally change our temperament and become a person of noble character and great ambition. No matter who it is, their nature is originally good, but the environment's bad habits, material desires, and bad temptations are unavoidable for everyone. What is valuable about education and self-cultivation is to eliminate all bad habits and desires and to develop the inherent virtue of their ancestors. Therefore, mistakes are possessed by everyone. As long as they can correct their mistakes and move towards goodness, everyone can become a saint or sage. The ancients said, "Ordinary people do not worry about having faults, but worry about concealing their faults. They do not value not having faults, but blame not correcting faults." These two sentences can be said to be the best maxims for us to be self-reliant, self-governing, to be a person, and to establish a career. All the efforts of preserving, nourishing, reflecting, and examining must start from this. In addition, there is also a most important sentence from the ancients called "The first thing in learning is to change one's temperament" (Xue Xuan). All great figures throughout history, both in China and abroad, have started from this. The purpose of what I just said about self-government and self-reliance is to "change one's temperament." The specific effort is to innovate our living habits, thoughts, and actions. Finally, we must completely change all bad temperaments into good temperaments. We must be able to govern ourselves, be self-reliant, and change our temperament, and then we can become an extraordinary person and establish a great career. If we can truly restrain ourselves, change our habits, and change our temperament, then there is no enemy that we cannot overcome and no career that we cannot complete. The meaning of "changing one's temperament," in modern terms, is "changing one's life." To change our life, we must first change our lifestyle. To change our lifestyle, we must first determine a revolutionary worldview. What is a revolutionary worldview? The truth that I recognize and practice is that "the purpose of life is to improve the life of the entire human race, and the meaning of life is to create the succeeding life of the universe." In other words, the true meaning and purpose of life is not for oneself, but for all people. Moreover, it is not only for preserving the present, but for creating the future. When I was young, I also had a bad environment and I was not without faults. Even around the age of twenty, my health was not very good. But later, I made up my mind to strive for self-improvement, to cultivate various habits of strengthening my body and establishing my character, and to force myself to practice them at all times. For example, when I was an enlisted student in Takada, Japan, in that coldest place, no matter how heavy the snow was or how cold the weather was, I would always wipe my body with cold water before going to bed every night, and after getting up in the morning, I would always wash my face with cold water. After I developed this habit, I have never interrupted it for a long time. Even today, the first thing I do every morning is to wash my face with cold water. Only with this lasting and continuous spirit can I change my bad habits and change my temperament. Therefore, my body and spirit are still very good this year when I am almost fifty years old. I can endure hardship. No matter what I do, I can compete with you young people. As for the success or failure of my career, I dare not know. But if it comes to the cultivation of virtue, then I dare to have confidence. Continuing from this, there will surely be some achievements. Everyone must know that changing habits and changing one's temperament is not an easy task, but as long as you can make up your mind, you can definitely achieve your goal. For example, Zeng Guofan used to like to smoke tide cigarettes, and he tried to quit many times but failed. Therefore, he felt that quitting smoking was even more difficult than fighting a war. But later, he made up his mind and persevered, and he was able to completely quit. Although it is a small matter, it can be seen as a big one. Zeng Guofan said, "The ancients called it a golden elixir to change bones. I say that setting ambition is the golden elixir." To change our habits and change our temperament, we must set our ambition. All of you students have been able to go to university and must have come from wealthy families and lived above the middle class. If you still rest content with being well-fed and well-clothed and cannot set a great ambition to save the country and the people and to work hard and struggle, then the well-fed and well-clothed families have ruined you. If you enter our school and cannot make up your mind to strive for self-improvement, thinking that you can get promoted and become wealthy after graduation, then you have destroyed the revolutionary party, or it can be said that the revolutionary party has destroyed you. Everyone must remember that our revolutionary party is a very poor and bitter big family. Our Premier and the general martyrs do not know how much effort they have sacrificed and have gone through thousands of difficult struggles to have today. All the teachers and students of our political school are the orphans and weak women left behind in this big family. You all rely on them to take on the responsibility of carrying on the past and opening up the future for this family. From now on, you must establish the great ambition to save the country and the people, develop the spirit of self-reliance and self-government, cultivate a revolutionary personality, increase practical knowledge, love each other, work hard, endure hardship, and unite together to struggle and sacrifice for the country and the nation, to benefit mankind and create the world, and then you can fulfill the mission of the students of this school. Today, we have gathered all our teachers and students and senior generals here. It is a very rare opportunity to speak, especially for the Mongolian and Tibetan students. You have ambitions in all directions, and the careers that you can do for the country in the future are especially great. I hope that everyone will remember what I said today and when school started last year and work hard and conscientiously. (End)</p>
<h3>Normal University Trains Extraordinary Educational Talents</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) Li Zheng, president of National Normal University, summoned students for a discussion, stating briefly that there were three points regarding what people have reported:</p>
<p>1. The process of assigning student representatives from this school to go to Beijing</p>
<p>2. The school's educational policy will continue as usual with a normal attitude. Although there is no significant construction or improvement in the area of teaching materials, the school has specially formed a supplementary teaching material research committee to study matters that should be promoted and reformed, as well as increases and decreases in teaching materials. Students can also submit suggestions to the committee, which will surely adopt the best ones. Regarding the problem of education during extraordinary times, the Ministry of Education has already established a special committee to study and implement education during extraordinary times. When concrete plans are announced, this school will surely comply. The school's construction matters, such as the addition of a large auditorium and gymnasium this semester, have already been planned by the construction committee and have been submitted to the Ministry of Education for the record. However, due to environmental factors, they have become pending. It is still possible to realize them this semester if there are no special circumstances.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the students, I hope for three points: 1. To train a strong physique and prepare for actions during extraordinary times. Students who went to the countryside to give lectures this time suffered from the hardship of trekking and became ill due to fatigue, which is a sign of a weak physique. 2. To develop the national spirit, we should take the correct path to obtain the awareness and unity of the entire nation. 3. In addition to regular coursework, we should prepare the talent to save the country during extraordinary times. In the future, before any action, we must frequently use our cold brains and think before we act. It is best to avoid unfortunate incidents, which would be a blessing not only for the students but also for the country.</p>

The school authorities are also seeking to reduce the financial burden on parents by uniformly reducing tuition fees for all grades in junior and senior high school. For junior high school students from truly impoverished families, a portion or all of the tuition and miscellaneous fees may be reduced. As a result, enrollment applications have been very crowded recently. Furthermore, the number of children in the affiliated Guoben Elementary School has increased sharply this semester, so more teachers have been hired, a children's playground has been established, and more playground equipment has been purchased. The school is located near Jiaozhou Park and Zhaofeng Park, with fresh air, making it an ideal place for students to study. It is said that there are not many vacancies in each grade, so registration should be done as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Graduates Eager to Apply</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of oversupply in society has become commonplace. However, there is still a shortage of female physical education teachers.

According to a survey by the school, there are currently nearly 800 alumni distributed in the education sector both domestically and internationally, with a good reputation. Whenever the semester changes, large and small schools in various places send letters to the school entrusting them to find teaching talent for physical education, music, and scouting. For example, this semester, Chongqing Zhiping Girls' Middle School, Weihaiwei Girls' Middle School, Anhui Hefei Vocational School, and Nanjing, Hankou, Hangzhou, Nanyang, and Dutch territories have all sent letters and telegrams to the school requesting teachers. The school has agreed to introduce its graduates to these institutions. The graduates have excellent prospects, which is due to the school's serious education and training, resulting in personnel with strong work ability and a sense of responsibility, who are trusted by others. It is also evident that there is a strong social demand for physical education and scouting teachers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shu turned her head to thank the loyal nurse, but Donn was grabbing Xingxie Tongzi, who were waiting at the door to greet her, and whispered, "Step back; she doesn't have the spirit to talk to us right now."</p>
<p>"No, don't step back. All of you together, I want you all. Come in and see me, my children. I have lost you for so long," Mrs. Shu said, stretching out her hands to Chu Suichou; they surrounded her and accompanied her into her room, not saying much along the way, but expressing a lot of emotion, using concerned eyes and clumsy little gestures to show their worry and sympathy.</p>

Afterwards, Chen Zongqi, Zhou Dayun, and others did well on both sides. Although Chen Xianglong scored one goal, Xiexing had already taken the lead with 9 to 7.</p>
<p>Later, Feng Nianxiang, surrounded by many players, swooped back like a kite, creating a tie of 9 to 9. Lu Changjiao and his brother scored one goal and one free throw, taking the lead again with 11 to 9. Xu Heng scored a goal, tying the score again at 11 to 11, 15 to 15, and then 17 to 17. Afterwards, Feng Nianhua presented two consecutive goals, and Weng Ren'an passed for two points, so Donghua led 21 to 19 at halftime by one point.</p>
<p>When the battle drum sounded again, Weng Ren'an tied the score. Feng and Lu assisted each other, taking the lead again. Zhou Dayun scored two goals with two shots, tying the score four times. At this moment, the tension of the battle was exhilarating. The score was fluctuating, always with a lead of only one point.</p>
<p>The score remained close until 40 to 39 (Donghua leading). Looking at the time, there were still five minutes left. Unexpectedly, short throws and shots were effective, so they jumped to the lead with 43 to 41. From then on, Xiexing cleared the clouds and saw the blue sky. Zhou and Xu, under the basket, explored, with their height and long arms, were exceptionally smooth. Donghua presented a difficult situation in the late game, and the crisis could not be reversed. As a result, Xiexing won with a score of 55 to 46.</p>

<h3>Our Country Attends the World Games - The Reason for Sending Only One Walker for the Race Walking Event</h3>
<p>The Chinese Race Walking Association only sent one person to participate in the race walking event at the World Games. It sent a letter to the Sports Association requesting an increase in the number of participants so that they could form a strong team. Yesterday, Mr. Shen Siliang of the Association replied to Mr. Shi Renyouhui of the Race Walking Association, stating that due to limited funding, it was difficult to accept the request. An abstract of the letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Upon review, the directors of this Association decided to send personnel to participate in the World Games. At that time, we carefully considered the budget constraints and had to carefully examine the outstanding achievements of various sports, discussed them in detail, and decided to send personnel. This was a reluctant decision. Furthermore, after reviewing the race walking event, which is one of the track and field events, the number of participants this time can actually be included within track and field. The directors specially clarified this because the first-place result in the demonstration event at the 6th National Games was close to the world record. Compared with the 12 participants in track and field, it is still insufficient to allocate one person per event, which has already shown the intention to encourage race walking. In addition, according to your letter, the race walking staff has not been specified, and there will be a lack of people to guide the competition in the future, which is a deep concern. The Association has long considered this point, but due to financial constraints, it has not been possible to make separate provisions. The guiding duties at that time may be performed concurrently by track and field staff, which is the same as the swimming event. In short, the nature of this participation in the World Games is to observe international technology and learn from it. However, due to the depletion of funds, it is difficult to send as many sports experts and athletes as possible. The colleagues of the Association are deeply sorry." (Omitted below)</p>

<h3>Yarn Market and Cotton Yarn Market Still Dependent on Actual Sales</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation became more peaceful. Because the yarn in storage still has no liquidity, sellers are still stable, and the market price is hovering. However, the current demand for yarn from customers is not weak. The future changes will depend on the actual sales in the market.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn First Rises, Then Falls</p>
<p>The opening price of the futures yarn market in the morning was calm for the near-term contracts. After the second round of bidding, the market price trended higher. With the improvement in the current yarn business and the promising signs of spring sales, people were optimistic. There was a lack of new sellers in the market. By the third closing, the market atmosphere turned higher. The April contract broke through the 200 yuan mark. As a result, the closing price for each month rose by 0.48 to 1.123 yuan compared to the previous day. The afternoon opening was flat. Because the Osaka Sanpin yarn market saw mixed ups and downs of 0.24, short sellers argued that the yarn in storage was not moving, and the market situation declined. As a result, the closing price for each month fell by 0.5678 yuan compared to the previous day. It was found that 800 bales of Da Fu, 700 bales of Yu Da, 650 bales of He Xing, 750 bales of Geng Feng, and 500 bales of Da Feng were sold. 450 bales of Tong Ji, 400 bales of Da Feng, 400 bales of Da Ji, 400 bales of Da Ji, 2,800 bales of Da Chang Cheng, 600 bales of Run Kang, 900 bales of Xin Cheng, and 350 bales of Tong He were bought.

<p>The cotton market advanced in the morning and retreated in the afternoon. As the large amounts of Tong Ji were concentrated, the amount in the account had reached over 80,000 dan.

However, it was found that the price had already rebounded by about 2 yuan from the low price. Overseas Indian cotton futures contracts for April and May white raw cotton were still down 14-15 rupees compared to the previous month. American cotton was also flat.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Offsets Floating Positions</p>
<p>The opening of the futures cotton market in the morning was very firm. The market buyers were active. There was a lot of discussion in the market that the bulls were preparing to take delivery and were relentlessly tightening the near-term contracts. The situation was firm. After the second round of bidding, the rising trend became stronger. Offsetting floating positions was also urgent. The June and July contracts broke through the 3 yuan mark. By the time of closing, some of the bulls sold, slightly easing the situation. As a result, the closing price for each month rose by 0.1 to 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day. The afternoon opening was small for the near-term contracts, 0.1 to 0.05 yuan. The far-term contracts declined. After the second round of bidding, it was calm. With the weakness of the yarn market, the market was stagnant. By the quick month, there was a sudden loosening. As a result, the near-term contracts rose by 0.05, and the far-term contracts fell by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan.

It was found that the sales volume was 14,981 bales in Shanghai, 2,825 bales in Tianjin, and 1,194 bales in India, which was the largest. The situation of transportation to various places is recorded below (unit: bale).</p>
<h3>Food: Flour and Wheat Rises, Then Suffers Setbacks</h3>
<p>Initially Rose Due to Active Actual Sales, but Ultimately Fell Back Due to Bulls Selling</p>
<p>The northern sales of the flour market are still active, and the retail sales in Nanyang are also strong. The market is quite lively. When the market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat rose by 0.4 yuan. Both Liverpool and Australia reported increases, which led to offsetting of floating positions and inquiries from outside the industry. The market price immediately soared by 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 yuan. In particular, the near-term contracts saw brisk inquiries due to actual sales. However, after the market price increased, factories immediately took advantage of the high price to sell. Large bulls sold out immediately, and the market situation saw a fall of 0.01 to 0.03 yuan. But in the afternoon, customer sales were still active, and the closing was still stable.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat rose, and the price of standard flour soared. Current flour was active, so both short covering and new bulls were active. The near-term contracts immediately rose by 0.04 and 0.05 yuan, and the far-term contracts rose by 0.04 and 0.01/0.02 yuan. But in the afternoon, the price of standard flour fell, and the market sentiment softened again. In addition, inland factories sold hedging positions, and all months fell. Current wheat arrivals and sales were both weak. Traders were very firm, intending to raise the price to 5.3 yuan, but buyers only wanted to pay 5.25 yuan, so sales did not open.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to See Weakness</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from all provinces totaled 20-30 ships (about 6,000 shi of goods). Sales on the street were still sluggish. Consignment merchants only arranged for about 2,000 packages from Qingdao and Yantai provinces, so the situation was weak, and the market situation continued to be weak. As a result, the price of thick early japonica rice was lowered by 0.05 yuan, and the price of thin indica rice was reduced by 0.1 yuan. However, Du Yang's pointed rice and resistance rice were in balance with supply and demand, and there was not much change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's sources from various roads in Hexia totaled 17-18 ships. The road for white japonica rice in the market was dull and lifeless. The price was also weak, close to a corner. Early indica rice followed a small corner. Thin indica rice retail was flat, and the price was weak by a few cents to a corner. Sheep fat continued to arrive in small quantities. The market situation was completely Du [unclear] and guest pointed rice was unchanged. White yuan retail was sluggish, and the market showed a weakening trend. The price of other goods continued to be weak.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Yesterday Only the Local Street Market Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Ke Xian rice from various parts of eastern Zhejiang had decreased. The Yangtze River area still had 5-6,000 packages arriving from various ports in Jiangxi and Shahan, but the road for customer sales was stagnant for a long time. After Tianjin inquired once, yesterday only 200 packages of Yuan rice were sold. But the Tianjin consignment merchants still had a good appetite. In addition to arranging for thin indica rice from Hexia, they directly allocated foreign rice to the firms. Therefore, over 10,000 packages were packed out the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Ke Xian rice was all handled by the local street, with over 2,000 packages of Gan rice and over 500 packages of Shahan, Taizhou, and Humi rice. The market situation was similar to the previous market, and the situation was flat and soft.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Cake Rises Again in Afternoon</h3>
<p>Sesame Futures and Spot Both Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, standard soybean oil cake prices rose across the board because the Dalian market was optimistic and local market prices had fallen too much, which led to inquiries from exports and hoarding. Yesterday, the prices of both electric cake and soybean oil recovered by 0.01-0.02 and 0.04-0.05 yuan, respectively, and the downward trend in the oil market also eased, with only a difference of 0.1 and 0.05 yuan. As the Dalian gold notes contracted, people in this city began to hope for the best. In addition, the city's car wheel soybean oil has received inquiries from various Guangdong and Fujian provinces and car factories. Yesterday, there were 450 actual sales of Dalian soybeans, oil factories, and oil, which had been stagnant for many days. After the standard oil was liquidated and suppressed once in the morning, it soared in the afternoon, and the closing price was due to the increase of 0.03-0.04 yuan. The standard car soybean rose by 0.05-0.06 yuan. Due to the long-term stagnation of exports of foreign sesame, both the standard and spot goods were quiet.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Woolen Cloth, and Suits Sell Best</h3>
<p>Harris Tweed Soars by One Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, customer provinces have been handling woolens and woolen fabrics. The transactions in the public welfare association are active, and the prices are beautiful. This street's merchants and provinces need to slow down slightly, because they had previously stocked up a lot and must wait for a slight sale before they can restock. However, the suit merchants are handling them fiercely. Various glossy woolens, pullovers, and overcoat materials have been traded. Harris tweed has soared by one yuan per yard. Old Harris tweeds that previously sold for four yuan for ordinary yellow, red, gray, and ink green colors have now soared to five yuan. The sample retail price has reached 5.45 yuan, so buyers are not interested in restocking for the time being and will wait until the palace chooses a style before they are willing to cut and match. The reason for the price increase is that the fixed prices are high, customs duties and foreign exchange rates have increased, and new goods have not arrived.</p>
<h3>Flannel and Bleached Cloth Added to the Auction</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Thursday, the day of the Yuanfang Foreign Firm's 2,976th auction. Seventy-nine boxes of various goods were arranged. Taixi silk prices were still flat, Yuan velvet rose slightly, and Yuan feather silk all lost their color. It was spring, so three boxes of flannel, three boxes of blue cloth, and seven boxes of white flannel and white bleached cloth were added to the auction.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Lead Trends Are Firm</h3>
<p>The recent transactions of lead have been quite lively. Paint companies, yellow lead, etc. have all made purchases, and customer roads such as Hankou, Jiujiang, and Nanjing have also inquired. Therefore, the market is very strong. The price of Canadian lead is 23.25 yuan, which is 0.25 yuan higher than before. The price of Xiang lead is 21.5 yuan. It was found that there were six or seven loads opened yesterday and the day before, but there was very little stock in the market. Those who hold the goods are firm, so they are unwilling to sell easily. Seeing the current situation, there is a trend of continued rise in the future market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Has Been Quiet for a Long Time, and Now It's Thinking of Moving</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association's allocation price for 24 Dutch raw white sugar was unchanged for both spot and re-export goods. Taikoo Sugar B Mark has not been allocated for a long time, and the number of people accepting it is almost zero. Yesterday, there was a slight transaction, with a price of 2.52.95 yuan. In addition to the re-export goods of Dong Chi White No. 9 K Mark, which were sold for 7.15 yuan, there were no changes in other goods. The first grade of Mian Bai Zhen Ji from the factory was 21.4 yuan, and the second, third, fourth, and fifth grades were as scheduled. The goods from Guangdong and Chaozhou provinces, including several dozen packages of Gao Huanggang Qing, were sold for 11 yuan. Also, 600-700 packages of Hainan Chi were sold for 12.345 yuan. Also, several dozen packages of ordinary branch Chi were sold for 12.67 yuan. Jian province opened a hundred-plus packages of second-class Chen Qing, with a price of 9 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Quanzhou Longan Will Arrive Within Days</h3>
<p>According to the Quanzhou Longan telegram, the next batch of goods has 300 outside boxes, which will be shipped to Shanghai on the Shan Hua Ping wheel. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days. If the number is still small, the asking price will be loosened.</p>
<h3>Tong'an Dried Longan First-Grade Goods Are Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Tong'an sun-dried longan meat has not arrived since the first market, so the stock on hand is out of stock. It was found that the firm's stock is also limited, so the trend is very tight. It is heard that a batch of Lianzhou goods has arrived in Guangdong, but because the cost is more than ten yuan higher, it is not profitable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Local Silk Industry Lacks Vitality</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai silk market has lacked vitality. It has been more than two sentences since the beginning of spring. Because the price of silk overseas has fallen frequently, it has not escaped the depression. Yesterday, New York was closed due to a holiday, and Yokohama spot prices continued to decrease (thirteen yuan lower than the previous day, while the quick period rose by two yuan). Judging from the market conditions of the Shanghai silk industry, it will take considerable loneliness and waiting before there is a possibility of development. However, judging from the current trend of the silk market, it is unlikely that it will be as firm as it was last month.</p>
<p>Red and Green Coarse Teas All Rise</p>
<p>However, Zhenmei Green Tea Is Still Unpopular</p>
<p>In the past two days, the coarse red and green teas in this city have been fiercely searched by customer provinces from Fujian, Shandong, and Qingdao, and the market has been unusually lively. The tea houses of Wang Yutai and Tong Jie, etc., have shipped out more than 3,000 packages of tea from Lianghu Ningzhou and the local green tea of Zhuang Tu [unclear] . Red tea has risen from 15-16 yuan to 22 yuan, and green tea has risen from 8-9 yuan to 12-13 yuan. In addition, the road for red, green, floral, and broken pieces is also smooth. However, Zhenmei green tea, which is sold by foreign houses, is still unpopular because the price in Morocco has decreased.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of the Financial Sector in an Economic Panic (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Hua</p>
<p>Based on this situation, the financial sector cannot be said to have abandoned its responsibility to support domestic industry and production. However, industry remains in decline, commerce remains stagnant, and the countryside remains in decay. Furthermore, factories are closing, factory sites are being auctioned off, and businesses are going bankrupt, worsening daily. This is due to a lack of working capital or a shortage of raw materials. On the one hand, the financial sector provides substantial funds during the four seasons and eight major festivals to support the development of domestic production. On the other hand, production is declining daily. We cannot help but find this contradictory phenomenon strange and should investigate its causes. For industry and commerce, this is due to failures in management, weak capital, low output, imperfect organization, improper management, incomplete planning, and an unstable foundation. In some cases, factories run out of funds before they even open, leaving them stretched thin and unable to develop. Such situations are not uncommon. In the financial sector itself, we believe a thorough and consistent central policy has not been established. Banking operations are extensive, and lending is critical to developing the national economy. However, the effect of lending is limited if a consistent central policy cannot be determined. A consistent central policy means defining the goal of supporting the national economy. For example, the central goal of the Industrial Bank should be to develop industry. The central goal of commercial banks should be to develop industry and commerce. Moreover, the Industrial Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Commercial Bank, which are similar in nature, should each have its most important central goal. Some should aim to support silk production, others to support the textile industry, others to support rural cooperatives, and others to support small inland industrial and commercial businesses. While lending should not be absolutely limited to these areas, continuous support should be given to production based on these central goals. Furthermore, comprehensive support should be provided in terms of factory organization, raw material procurement, factory reform, and product markets. This would prevent improper operations in these businesses and alleviate the pain of insufficient working capital. In this way, financial lending would be secure, and the supported production would be sustained. Therefore, a consistent spirit of support and a fixed policy can be considered a central policy. In the past, many shifts occurred due to temporary changes in the environment. When a particular industry thrived, most resources concentrated on its prosperity. When an industry struggled, support was often withheld. Even with the support of specialized industries, little attention was paid to the businesses' content and operating conditions, and when they failed, it was too late. As a result, a phenomenon emerged where industries that were thriving felt excessive competition, while industries in critical condition were left to collapse. In normal times, no attention was paid, and when losses occurred and resources were exhausted, there was no other option than to confiscate the base. Banks then suffered losses and were dragged down, even leading to capital stagnation and mutual destruction. All of these situations result from the failure to establish a clear central policy. While the financial sector cannot be held entirely responsible for sustaining production, paying attention to the development of these industries and avoiding major changes would alleviate the burden of providing constant support. This would ensure the security of financial lending and, more importantly, develop production.</p>
<p>(Three) Promoting Commodity Circulation and Inland Credit</p>
<p>In recent years, inland finance has experienced particular difficulties. The market is declining, and money houses are struggling. This has led to the decline and collapse of industry and commerce. The stagnation of inland industries affects cities. China relies on agriculture, so inland prosperity is crucial. Inland industries cannot develop because of the inability to promote commodity circulation and the lack of inland credit. The financial sector has tried its best to promote the flow of inland finance. However, the financial sector has its own position. Cautious lending is necessary, but excessive lending is dangerous, so banks must resort to secured lending. Small businesses cannot be ignored, but reckless investment without guarantees can endanger the financial sector. The financial sector is determined to promote inland industries and should have sound policies to do so. I will briefly outline two points based on my limited observations.</p>
<p>Promoting Inland Commodity Circulation Inland finance lacks circulation, making it more difficult for factories and businesses. The financial sector's principle is secured lending, and inland industry and commerce should meet the financial sector's requirements. Cooperation between the two parties will ensure smooth progress. Therefore, what is most needed now is a strong organization to improve commodity circulation. First, this organization must have the financial strength to handle discounting and lending to support commodity flow. Second, it must have access to markets everywhere to facilitate commodity circulation and raw material procurement. Third, it must use in-kind lending to achieve real results in inland financial circulation. The goal of the circulation organization is to introduce commodities and financial sector investment. Its services include: 1. Acting as an agent for purchasing and circulating commodities and raw materials. 2. Acting as an agent for transportation and related matters. 3. Handling discounting and lending. 4. Handling the collection and payment of goods. 5. Guiding quality improvement and grading. 6. Assisting the government in investigating adulteration and fraud. 7. Promoting sales and sending samples. 8. Investigating market conditions and reporting business intelligence. All of these will directly or indirectly promote the circulation of inland commodities.</p>
<p>Promoting Inland Letters of Credit Promoting commodity circulation will facilitate the flow of inland commodities. However, this only involves the financial sector acting as an agent for circulation and purchasing. The inability to circulate inland products is due to a lack of distribution agencies. However, the lack of inland credit is also important. Counties are hundreds of miles apart, so why can't products from one area be sold in another? The reason is simple: Buyers in the second area cannot obtain credit from manufacturers in the first area and are afraid to ship goods directly. Manufacturers in the first area cannot obtain credit from buyers in the second area due to inconvenient transportation and poor communication, so they are afraid to consign goods rashly. Unless manufacturers from the first area send personnel to the second area to promote sales, or buyers from the second area bring cash to the first area to purchase goods, the transaction cannot be completed. The lack of credit between the two areas prevents the circulation of products. Therefore, establishing credit between the two areas is essential for the prosperity of the inland economy, and the financial sector is responsible for facilitating inland credit. The local financial sector should make full use of letters of credit. For example, if a buyer in the second area purchases goods from the first area, they can seek a guarantee from a local bank and request a letter of credit. If the path is normal and the principles are in line, the certificate will be issued, and the buyer will deliver the letter of credit to the bank (agent of the bank in the second area) in the first area for verification. The bank in the first area will then be responsible for handling the discounting or collecting the payment. In this way, credit between the two areas can be established through bank guarantees, and products can be circulated.</p>
<p>The above two methods can not only promote the sales of inland products, but also provide the financial sector with safe methods for lending and fully support the development of inland industries. Therefore, inland finance depends not on expanding the financial sector or lending indiscriminately, but on finding safe and accessible policies. This requires the joint efforts of inland industry, commerce, and the financial sector.</p>
<p>The above three points are based on my limited observations and from the perspective of the financial sector. Many enlightened people in the financial sector have already planned and considered these matters carefully. However, given the vastness of our country and its abundant resources, industrial development cannot be achieved without cooperation and consensus. In this economic panic and the global economic recession, the financial sector cannot be solely blamed or held responsible. However, we must look to the financial sector to lead industry and commerce onto the right track. (End)</p>

<h3>The Struggle for Love</h3>
<p>— Su Ying</p>
<p>Because I've been teaching in school recently, I've had the opportunity to be close to groups of children.</p>
<p>I've always been unfamiliar with children. Books and other people praise children so much that I believe they are pure, flawless, superhuman angels. But this time, after getting in touch with them, I was unexpectedly disappointed.</p>
<p>Of course, children are not without endearing qualities. Their willful actions and emotions are things that we, who are controlled by hypocrisy, would not dare to do. If children have what is called innocence, it's probably in this "willfulness."</p>
<p>Among a group of children that I was getting used to, there was a girl of about ten years old. Her high forehead, big black eyes, and strong, resilient lips showed that she had a strong personality. Among this group of children, she was the quietest. Perhaps because I was similar to her in this respect, I played with her especially closely and inevitably became slightly indifferent to the other children. The other children themselves wouldn't notice this. However, it eventually led to conflict.</p>
<p>Whenever she played ball with me, the other children naturally wanted to join in. But she would not allow it, puffing up her strong, resilient little mouth, pushing people away, and yelling, "Go away! Go away!" until she got her way. This obvious possessiveness caused a unanimous dislike of her by the other children. In addition, whenever a child asked me for coins to buy something, she would always mercilessly scold them, "Shameless, begging for Mr. X's coins!" This, of course, was also easy to cause aversion. Later, some children banded together to oppose her. Everyone unanimously decided not to pay attention to her, and openly mocked her, ridiculed her, saying that she was flattering the teacher, that she was bullying the weak. Sometimes everyone would surround her, imitating her voice, imitating her movements. After some time, the children's encirclement policy was successful. Finally, she no longer played with me. When she saw me, she avoided me from afar, and sometimes she couldn't be stopped even if you pulled her. This reminded me of playing with my younger siblings at home. Among them, quarrels are common, and the cause is often me. One would say, "Second Brother is mine, you don't get any!" Another would definitely get anxious, face flushed, and yell, "Second Brother is mine! Not yours!" As usual, they would end up fighting, and I, as the second brother, would have to mediate. My old method was, "Second Brother belongs to everyone, everyone gets a share." Although the conflict stopped, judging from the expressions of my younger siblings, they were clearly still not satisfied, because it wasn't determined whose Second Brother belonged to whom.</p>
<p>Fighting over the ownership of something, excluding others in order to be possessive, taking to mocking and trapping behaviors because of jealousy—these are all expressions of a lack of awareness. This phenomenon, needless to say, is as common as eating in the adult world, and it is also so widely expressed in the children's world, which is very worrying.</p>
<p>Children's hearts are originally pure white, originally without any prejudices. The occurrence of prejudices is caused by the accumulation of life experience. In a society with a private ownership system, when children become conscious, adults constantly impart private ownership concepts to them. Even the dumbest child may not know that rice is cooked from white rice, but they will never not know that something is theirs and that others cannot take it away. Born in such a society and receiving such education, it is, in a way, impossible to blame the children deeply. For children to truly understand and truly love each other, a rational social life is a necessary precondition.</p>
<h3>The Cave of the Recluse</h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>—A Note on Kek Lok Si Temple—</p>
<p>The tram rattled from the city center to the light and peaceful suburbs. The quiet streets of Penang Island were covered with the golden light of the sun, while the villa-style cottages scattered in the suburbs were surrounded by greenery. The "Garden of the South" has its delicate and exquisite posture, and at the end of the tram line, Kek Lok Si Temple, the refuge of recluses seen from outside a small teahouse, also shimmered with golden brilliance under the sunlight.</p>
<p>Climbing the steps from the foot of the mountain, the mountain peaks pressed down from above. The vast halls were filled with incense, and the sound of wooden fish lulled the nerves. Portraits of famous people from Nanyang and abroad hung in the reception hall. One imagines that the nameless heroes who pioneered the wilderness in the past have been buried and forgotten. Penang Island has been built into the "Garden of the South," Kek Lok Si Temple has become a refuge for recluses, and those who opened up the wilderness in the past died from poisonous snakes and miasma, while their successors are now constantly being oppressed and expelled!</p>
<p>Kek Lok Si Temple is now a capitalist world of Qing-era temples. It is said that one can buy a lifetime of retirement for five hundred yuan. Our leisurely gentlemen should come to see the large potted flowers planted by these monks and the comfortable "dormitories" by the red railings! Also, the abbot, who serves as a supporter and custodian, comes from an "eight-legged essay" background. He manages the temple property, deals with government officials, British gentlemen, and overseas Chinese "towkays." Under him, there are spokespersons who are skilled in Chinese, English, and various dialects of Min and Yue, and artists who decorate the temple. A great philanthropist donated a pagoda, allowing the entire panorama of Penang Island to be captured at the top of the pagoda. Many philanthropists released a large number of turtles, large and small, adding many tourists' footprints to the small pool in front of the rock garden. The courtyard is elegant and full of flowers, and the halls are spacious and beautiful. A young monk sighed that the "recession" wind had begun to blow into this "Pure Land," but in their hearts, they had never calculated that one day, perhaps "recluses" would also have "no world to escape."</p>
<p>A mountain spring meandered down from the mountain peak on the left, and the sound of the spring was very pleasant in the quiet environment. The source of the spring was shaded by tall branches, and several small pools were formed next to Kek Lok Si Temple. The green mountains behind spread out with dense forests, and birds flew swiftly over the golden pools and forests. The Penang Strait stretched out in front, and ships constantly spewed black smoke. The entire Penang Island garden used Kek Lok Si Temple's support against the mountainside to create the artistic style of a rock garden. Penang Island is doing its best to attract wealthy people from the Malay Peninsula and settle them in dense residential areas that are small and elegant, setting up a haven for recluses for retired scholar-officials and wealthy families who fail to make money.</p>
<p>Looking at the recluses in the sound of chanting and wooden fish, can the bloodshed of the 20th century be washed away from them? And in the future, will the cave of the recluse be rebuilt with the renewal of the South?</p>
<h3>Reminiscence of a Friend on a Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhizhong</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the respite in the night rain, I put on a heavy, damp coat and walked into a house forgotten by the century, where even a roar would blow off the roof.</p>
<p>A melancholy dust-covered desk held a piece of white paper. The white paper caught my eye. I turned it over: Zhou Duanfu passed away from illness on × month × day at ×× Hospital in Nanjing!</p>
<p>He's dead! The iron hammer of a rough life shattered a kind and solid life!</p>
<p>Sadness wove the net of fate, allowing the evening mist to deeply lock Yanzi Rock. As the spray splashed against the night moon, I prayed for him to roar wildly for one last flash!</p>
<p>I remember—deeply remember—his fragile character, which controlled his fragile life. Because the fire had scorched his will to live, he mercilessly whipped his own body, but the scales of wounds did not mend the cracks in his life. Who harmed him!</p>
<p>It was an autumn night when the fine rain tapped against the banana leaves, and a coldness permeated the house. He and I were facing each other on the bed, listening intently as the air seemed to hum a hymn. He bowed his head, also seeming to pray. In the vast sea of people, he couldn't grasp a piece of reality so much! His thinking originally had some religious impurities, so responsibility became his intuition. If the facts broke through the scope of his consciousness, he would spit out mouthfuls of bright red blood.</p>
<p>But even he himself didn't know that this was early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis!</p>
<p>Four ounces of fine rice and a bag of five-spice beans—this was our farewell meal for the five months we lived together. We ate and drank, and the night rain quietly carried away the hours, until drunkenness overwhelmed our excitement, and we each went to sleep. The next morning, he embarked on an unfamiliar journey to find food.</p>
<p>This was four years ago. In the four years, we suffered the looting of life, and even correspondence became less frequent. Even when he came to Shanghai sometimes, we rarely had the chance to meet. Until one summer afternoon this year, due to the impact of a hundred degrees of heat, I turned from a narrow, cool, secluded alley onto another road, and at the alley entrance, I ran into him. He waved his hand, willow-like wrinkles sweeping across his face. It was a smile, hanging straight down from the corners of his eyes to his mouth, his lips moving repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Life has carved thousands of traces on your face!" I lamented.</p>
<p>He made no sound, but I understood the meaning from the breath he exhaled. The gray net of fate had captured him. From his scorched palms, ash-gray face, and copious phlegm clots, I determined that his pulmonary tuberculosis had reached the end of the third stage.</p>
<p>But the patient is afraid to hear about the crisis of his own illness, as an ugly woman is afraid to look in the mirror. Although we had two or three days of reunion again, he on his short bed, me on the floor, we talked, but our topic was only the situation after parting and the waves of human affairs, and did not mention his illness; he was still talking vigorously, and smiled cheerfully when he was happy, the scene was the same as four years ago, but the spiritual distance was very far!</p>
<p>Early on the third day, I sent him to the Jiangwan Tuberculosis Sanatorium. He spiritedly carried a rattan basket from the tram to the bus station. He stopped me from going forward—</p>
<p>"Don't go, it's very hot. Come see me once a week; when I get better, we'll have a few days of fun!"</p>
<p>The school bell at St. Mary's rang, not knowing whether it was urging me to go to class or ringing for our eternal farewell. Under those two green plane trees, we shook hands for the last time in a hurry!</p>
<p>I don't know when he returned to Nanjing, and I don't know when the devil stretched out his iron claws. When I held the white paper printed with the word "Obituary" with trembling hands, I immediately offered up my tears as a libation!</p>
<h3>The Heartache of a Homesick Patient</h3>
<p>— He Guiren</p>
<p>Seeing those brand-new spring couplets with feudal overtones again made me think of my old hometown and my elderly father. My father, a scholar who is old and has nothing to do, likes to make spring couplets himself every year; often, in the few days before New Year's Eve, he spends all day caressing dictionaries and chanting couplets. The door couplets are stipulated to start with the characters of the year's sexagenary cycle, while the hall couplets are tailored to his own status, and sometimes he expresses a little complaint; however, he hates vulgar customs, and I have never seen sentences of blessing or prayer in the spring couplets of the past ten years.</p>
<p>That was the year before last when my father turned fifty, and his head was already full of white hairs. He adapted two lines of poetry from Lu Fangweng and wrote a hall couplet: "White hair cannot rely on injured friends, the green lamp has a taste for teaching children." From this couplet, one can also appreciate my father's emphasis on the education of his children on weekdays. My father taught us very seriously: Chinese studies and Japanese studies, never resting until we could recite them. Every night, he would use up a lamp of oil, and he himself would sit at his desk, explaining each word and sentence. This kind of enlightenment work consumed my father's ten years of life, so these two lines of poetry can quite express his mood. This couplet was written by my father himself and pasted by himself on the wooden pillars of the desk.</p>
<p>It was from this year that I started wandering, north and south, and have not returned to my hometown until now; when this "abolished calendar" New Year has just passed, thinking of the spring couplets in my hometown and the couplets my father used to write, in helplessness, a burst of miserable heartache of a homesick patient suddenly floated into my heart.</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on "Hu Shih Style"</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>It's all the same wasted effort, the same wasted words, in our discussion about "Hu Shih Style." Look at the Book of Songs, the Songs of Chu, who first stipulated the form, who first restricted the content, and then created them?</p>
<p>Today (January 17th), I saw the articles published by Mr. Ren Jun and Mr. Zi Mo in the Literary Weekly, and both misunderstood me, forcing me to reply, which I'm really not happy about. It just so happens to be the eve of the Lunar New Year, and the year-end is pressing, so I don't have the leisure to write articles, please forgive me for this.</p>
<p>"Hu Shih Style" is one of many new poetry styles that I listed in "Tonglu Poetry Talk." Mr. Ren Jun said that I "particularly pointed out," and Mr. Zi Mo said that I "specially proposed" it. I don't know if they are lying? Or did they not finish reading those ten poetry talks before making a judgment and drawing a conclusion? If it is necessary to insist that I "particularly pointed out" or "specially proposed" a poetry style, then it would only be "satirical poetry." In this section of poetry talk, I talked about Mr. Yang Sao's "Ode to Beer," saying that it "seems like a decadent lament, but is actually an angry tone; it seems like a weariness of life, but is actually a passionate desire for survival." Then I said, "I think that from personal cries to social shouts, this is a major path for poets to advance. Using profound and ingenious writing, exposing reality, criticizing reality, satirical poetry with more passion than ideals should be a unique style in the current poetry scene, but unfortunately, I have not yet seen a poet who has made a name for himself with it." In the many paths of new poetry, pointing out that this is "a major path to advance," and saying that poets who take this path can be "unique" in the current poetry scene, this does seem like "particularly pointing out" or "specially proposing," and at the same time it does contain an intention to encourage people or "advise" people. If it is said that this really deserves "serious" responsibility, I will not shy away from it. If my words are not that "serious," and are deliberately misinterpreted, confirmed and exaggerated, then there is another purpose.</p>
<p>I myself have written many new poems using colloquial language, and I have never thought of learning "Hu Shih Style," except for "Flying Charm," which I deliberately joked about when I published it in the New Year issue of "The Analects." But I dare to guarantee that this poem is not like Mr. Zi Mo's "Flying Praise," which, in terms of content, is "an expression of the leisure and comfort of the leisure class," although in terms of form it seems to be similar to "Flying Praise." Mr. Ren Jun first said that I "inevitably have the suspicion of deliberately advising people to turn back the clock," and then said, "Mr. Chen always believes that Hu Shih Style is a new path and wants to advise people to take it." I don't know who I have advised, in fact, I have never even done that myself. I only admit that among many paths there can be such a path, among many styles there can be such a style, whoever takes or does not take that path, whoever uses or does not use that kind of poetry style, is up to them. I have never said that this is the only path for new poetry, this is the only new poetry style. After I put this forward, I expected that some people might misunderstand, so I immediately made a solemn statement saying, "Of course, it is not to say that this is the only path." In the dozen or so sections of poetry talk that I have already written, in terms of the form of new poetry, I pointed out that there are many paths for new poetry, which can be freely chosen, and can also be freely created. I have never妄想统制诗坛(Wàngxiǎng tǒngzhì shītán - presumptuously hoped to control the poetry world). There is more than one road to Rome, it is okay to return by different routes, that's always how I think. From my point of view, proposing "Hu Shih Style" and acknowledging it as one of many new poetry styles, I think the result may not be as Mr. Ren Jun said: "This not only completely negates the achievements of the new poetry movement that has been painstakingly managed for more than ten years, but also, to put it more seriously, inevitably has the suspicion of deliberately advising people to turn back the clock." Mr. Ren Jun insists on saying this, I don't know what his intention is.</p>
<p>Looking at the four articles by Ren Jun, Zi Mo, and Bo Han, about the opinions on the content of new poetry, and how the content and form are related, there is no conflict with me. The place where they criticize me is only on one of the forms of new poetry, that is, "Hu Shih Style evolved from old poems and old words." I admit that in many styles of new poetry, it is okay to have this one, let it exist, and Ren Jun and Zi Mo completely deny it. Bo Han quite admits my statement, but with conditions attached, I can also quite admit the several conditions he put forward, and there is no dispute between me and him. I will not be a "devil's advocate," but I still have something to answer to Ren Jun and Zi Mo. After this reply, I also want to stop talking about "Hu Shih Style" from now on.</p>
<p>The "reason" why I acknowledge that "Hu Shih Style evolved from old poems and old words" can be regarded as a style of new poetry, the original reason is only saying that "I think that the many rhyme schemes of poetry, lyrics, ballads and tunes created by the predecessors by matching the advantages of the inherent Chinese language and writing can still be freely used by our new poets. Of course, it is not possible to rigidly adhere to those rules of those schemes, and at the same time, it is okay to create new schemes and adopt the schemes of foreign poetry." To this day, I still think that these words have not committed any "serious" mistakes, no matter how you analyze them, as long as you are willing to use your clear mind, honestly speaking, if Chinese characters are not abolished, ancient books are not burned, and someone wants to accept things called "literary heritage," then the style of poetry and the methods or techniques of poetry creation will always have some influence on later poets. I have not prematurely advocated "accepting literary heritage" before our great political creations of "anti-imperialism" and "anti-feudalism" have been completed, just like what Radek said in his speech at the Writers' Congress a few years ago: "Our literature has discovered the road of great creation. The great road of creation is based on excellent traditions." But there are things that develop along this "progressive tradition," which will more or less bring the influence of tradition, and still show the evolution of history, which is not entirely undesirable. Pay attention here! I say "influence" not "imitation," "evolution" not "inheritance." I said that a kind of poetry style "evolved from old poems and old words," and the original meaning of the two words "evolution" is only this. If you still think the two words "evolution" are too elegant, or there is something inappropriate, then change it to "evolution" is also okay. Although Hu Shih is not "my friend," I will not cater to his preferences or speak up for him, everyone can rest assured. Just because I talked about a new poetry style evolved from old poems and old words, and incidentally labeled it as "Hu Shih Style," it caused a lot of trouble, which is where I failed to check. Why not take Mr. Lu Xun's "Ancient-Style Doggerel" and "My Loss of Love" as examples? It is cheaper to learn to cheer in the opera, taking my own recent works "Flying Charm" and "Ode to Flood" as examples, perhaps it is not as serious a problem as "a complete negation of the achievements of the new poetry movement that has been painstakingly managed for more than ten years." I remember I once respectfully composed a poem "Fiftieth Birthday Self-Celebration Poem" for Mr. Zhou Zuoren, and I couldn't help but be disappointed with his use of the old poetry style, especially with his use of not very appropriate thoughts as content. A young writer took this poem that I intended to discard and published it in his article "What World is This" in "Free Talk," which caused a debate with "The Human World" about Mr. Zhou. It's funny to say! Now the newspaper falls on me, I give a corner position to the evolved poetry style of old poems and old words, and I "have the suspicion of advising people to turn back the clock" and also suffered a "siege" once. When I think about a kind of "transmission theory," Mr. Zhou Zuoren, who is "half a expert," may secretly encourage, and curse me for deserving it!</p>
<p>Okay, let's just leave it at that, I don't want to argue anymore.</p>
<h3>The Special Qualities and Essence of Art</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>Art's depiction and expression of reality cannot but pass through sensual images. Art's method of expression does not use general, abstract means, but rather individual, concrete means.</p>
<p>Therefore, the special qualities of art exist in its method of expression, in its artistic form.</p>
<p>If one disregards this special quality of art, one will express "formulaic works" in creation, and express "government-style evaluations" in theory.</p>
<p>"Realistic literature discovers truth and ideals in visible reality, and expresses its literature in the form of visible reality." (Koyama Sanji)</p>
<p>"Visible reality" should be understood as the possibility of reality in the development of reality; "the form of reality" should be understood as the necessary essence of expressing reality, and the accidental concrete things. - In such an interpretation, the above definition should be used as the definition of our realistic literature.</p>
<p>This meaning contains two main moments (Momeut): first, what do we want to express? The answer is - "Express reality in the possibility of the development of reality"; second, how do we want to express it? The answer is - "Express reality in sensual images."</p>
<p>Clearly, these two moments, the first is the essence of art; the second is the special quality of art.</p>
<p>Confusing the essence of art with the special qualities of art is mechanism, formalism; confusing the special qualities of art with the essence of art is empiricism, formalism.</p>
<p>Mechanists and formalists wear a pair of forged "inevitable" glasses, which are made of "essence." However, he therefore cannot see reality and cannot express reality.</p>
<p>Empiricists and formalists wear a pair of forged "accidental" glasses, which are made of "phenomena." However, he therefore cannot see reality and cannot reproduce reality.</p>
<p>Reality - the contradiction and unity of essence and phenomenon, the contradiction and unity of necessity and accident.</p>
<p>Essence is reproduced in phenomena, but a single phenomenon cannot express essence in its complete meaning; necessity is reproduced in accident, but a single accident cannot express necessity in its complete meaning. This means that phenomena should be dealt with in the development process of essence, and accidents should be dealt with in the development process of necessity.</p>
<p>But wouldn't this lead to "uniformity of themes"?</p>
<p>In all of Gorky's works, there are petty citizens, vagrants, and laborers; in a word, they are all "lower class" characters. He did not use themes like Tolstoy's "War and Peace" or Sinclair's "Oil!" - the so-called "upper class" themes! In all of Dostoevsky's works, there are also petty citizens and lower-class characters.</p>
<p>Why haven't Gorky's and Dostoevsky's works ever experienced "uniformity of themes"? On the contrary, Gorky created "epics" with rich content from these "lower classes"; Dostoevsky's development of themes is always unexpectedly rapid and bizarre!</p>
<p>Because Gorky graduated from "My Universities," and Dostoevsky experienced the lives of the characters in his works. They grasped the essence of art and the special qualities of art, they grasped the method of knowing art and the method of expressing art. Although Dostoevsky's worldview hindered his reality, their splendid flowers of art blossomed.</p>
<p>"Uniformity of themes" is due to the lack of the writer's life experience (depth of knowledge) or artistic cultivation (height of technique); that is, they did not grasp the essence and special qualities of art in unity.</p>
<p>"We call them decadent writers, not because Joyce, Proust, etc. are not great writers, on the contrary, because this decadence itself also has its positive aspects, like Joyce, etc., in terms of analytical intelligence and sensitivity, they have all reached a height that previous eras could hardly match. …The afterglow of the sunset of the first culture is sometimes more lovable than anything else in it."</p>
<p>The question of "lovable" is set aside for the time being, but to explain this phenomenon, to explain "the special qualities in the works of these modern great writers," besides the reason that "the existing culture is also rapidly declining" - which should be attributed to the essential reason for social development - shouldn't it be explained from the contradiction between the essence and special qualities of their art, so as to show its special qualities? Their art is "strange, bizarre," that is to say, the essence of their art is precisely the opposite of the essence of the development of reality, but they partially grasped the special qualities of art, that is, technique. But this technique can leave to us, is really very little. Why? Because they are too intoxicated in "the magic of language and the quagmire of trivial empiricism.</p>
<p>Then, "should we learn from these writers with decadent tendencies?" I think it is also possible. "I have read countless bad books, and bad books have also given me benefits" (Gorky.) But I also think that this is not our main object now. Why? Please quote Gorky again: "I like to read about the things of people who live in the same environment as myself." The environment and characters presented in the work are all experienced or observed by the author. Liking the characters and events in the work means that there is some kind of circumstantial and therefore conscious commonality between the reader and the author. Standing on this commonality, we learn how those great writers of the past showed the special qualities of art. Because the so-called conscious commonality does not mean that our consciousness is exactly the same as those great writers of the past, but means that some elements in the consciousness of that writer are included in the development process of our consciousness. So we are not learning their thoughts and consciousness, we are criticizing their thoughts and consciousness; maybe even attacking their thoughts and consciousness. We want to learn the technique of making the special qualities of art, and how to unify this special quality of art with its essence of art.</p>
<p>Essence is general, universal; special quality is special, individual. To grasp the correct essence of art, we should grasp it in reality, in the philosophy, science, and art that reflect reality. For those arts that do not have a complete worldview - that do not have a complete method of knowledge - we are approaching the special qualities of that art from a certain common point between them and us.</p>
<p>But it must also be noted here that the so-called special qualities of art cannot be separated from the decision of the social group to which the writer belongs. Our approach to this special quality of art is still through the refraction of our worldview's prism. Otherwise, it is slavish imitation, which cannot unify the essence and special qualities of art, and cannot create new art forms.</p>

<h3>Two Letters Regarding "Mian Li"</h3>
<p>(1) Curing a Young Woman's Freckles</p>
<p>To the Editor: I am a young woman in my school days. Instead of seeking wisdom in my studies, I have focused on beauty. It is quite shameful to admit. However, the concept of loving beauty is universal, especially for us women. Unfortunately, at the age of eleven or twelve, I developed freckles on my face. Initially, they were barely visible, but over four or five years, they gradually increased. I have spent countless thoughts and a great deal of money on this issue, yet the results have been disappointing. Two months ago, I saw an advertisement in the newspaper for a product called "Mian Li," which claimed to remove freckles. I didn't pay much attention to it because there are too many freckle-removing cosmetics on the market, none of which have proven to be effective. Later, some of my classmates bought it to try, and they said it was quite effective. This fact made it impossible for me not to believe it. I bought a bottle and applied it daily like a vanishing cream. After using one bottle, I noticed that the freckles had faded significantly. After using less than half of the second bottle, the freckles on my face had completely disappeared. The world is full of effective remedies, but people often miss them. Therefore, I am writing about my experience in treating freckles and asking you to publish it in a corner of your esteemed publication as a contribution to my fellow sisters. Yours sincerely, Yin Lijuan</p>
<p>(2) Clear Proof of Removing Acne To the Esteemed Editor: Thank you for instructing me on how to treat acne. After receiving your letter, I purchased a postal money order for one dollar and twenty cents and sent it directly to Tongren Pharmacy at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixin Bridge Street, French Concession, Shanghai. I bought a bottle of "Mian Li" and applied it as directed every day. In less than a week, it effectively removed all the acne from my face. Now, my wife considers it an indispensable beauty product. She says it is whiter and finer than any imported cream. I believe the effectiveness of "Mian Li" deserves praise, and your recommendation is greatly appreciated. Yours sincerely, Wu Xiqiao</p>
<h3>A Record of Treating Ringworm with Gan Lu</h3>
<p>— (Shao Cangbo)</p>
<p>Ringworm is a parasitic skin disease, most likely caused by bacteria invading the skin. Therefore, it is highly contagious and spreads easily. Without good medicine, it is difficult to eradicate completely because the bacteria remain in the skin, leading to recurrence. My aunt has suffered from ringworm for several years, and it can be said that her skin is completely affected. She experiences constant itching and pain, which is unbearable. Unfortunately, many medicines have been ineffective, and she has reached a point of resignation. As an elderly person, she finds it regrettable. Recently, I read an advertisement in the newspaper for "Gan Lu," a special medicine. Readers of this publication have also repeatedly recommended it. I was pleased and drove to Tongren Pharmacy at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixin Bridge Street, French Concession, the distributor of the medicine, and bought a bottle to send to my aunt for a trial. Although my aunt appreciated my gesture, she did not believe it could truly cure her disease. However, after applying it for a few days, something unexpected happened. The deep-seated hatred and aversion she had felt gradually disappeared. My aunt deeply thanked me, saying that without my action, she did not know how she would have gotten rid of this stubborn ringworm. However, the credit goes to the good medicine, and I merely facilitated the matter.</p>

<p>My younger brother, Jingyao, is unmarried and in his early twenties. In recent years, he has been very weak. He says he has suffered from nocturnal emission for four or five years, occurring five or six times a month, causing dizziness, blurred vision, insomnia, palpitations, and weakness in his limbs. He also experiences spermatorrhea when seeing women, among other symptoms. I would like to ask for a definite treatment method. (Xi Jinghui)</p>

<p>Effective Freckle Treatment</p>
<p>I have heard that "Mian Li" is quite effective in treating freckles. I don't know if this is true. My wife has suffered from freckles for a long time, which she finds regrettable.

The most effective treatment is...</p>
<p>Requesting Another Recommendation</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Shen, has suffered from chronic leukorrhea for three years. Medication has been ineffective, leading to neurasthenia and a sallow complexion. Previously, he saw in your publication that the special medicine for gonorrhea, "Genadoten," was very effective. He immediately purchased three boxes from Tongren Pharmacy at No. 1, Dexing Lane, Xixin Bridge Street, French Concession, and his leukorrhea was completely cured. He has been cured for several months and has not relapsed. This shows the effectiveness of the various medicines published in your esteemed publication. Now, my wife suffers from severe stomach pain, and I would like to ask for a simple treatment method and a good medicine. (Sun Dejun)</p>
<p>(Answer) Tongren Pharmacy also sells the holy medicine for stomach pain, "Wei Bi Ling" powder, which is effective in treating various stomach ailments. We have tested this medicine and found it to be repeatedly effective. Therefore, we dare to recommend it. The price is one dollar per box.</p>
<p>Comments</p>
<h3>On National Defense Drama</h3>
<p>— Luyou</p>
<p>The proposal of national defense drama, like national defense literature, is in line with the entire national salvation movement and the current dualistic situation. It is produced in response to the urgent needs of the reality. When the country and the nation are in dire straits, and our national enemies are playing new tricks, singing so-called "cooperation" and "peace" for the exclusive possession of China, we must urgently consolidate our national defense, drive our enemies out of China, and eliminate all traitors who sell out the country. This manifests itself in the mass actions of the entire vigorous national salvation movement. Regardless of class or faction, all unite under this goal and truly share the national crisis. This is reflected in drama and literature, which are weapons of combat, as the construction of national defense drama and national defense literature.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of national defense drama, the first thing to mention is the content of national defense drama and its main task. We must not ignore the particularity of national defense drama, but we cannot isolate it because of it. On the contrary, national defense drama is closely related to general realistic drama. It is only a new type of drama produced under special circumstances. Therefore, we cannot separate it from general drama, but must form a complete relationship with general drama. We must also maximize its particularity and make it a driving force for the national salvation movement to expand. Only in this way...</p>
<p>We know that adapting to China's current environment requires the most magnificent combat power to consolidate national defense. This combat power not only relies on military power, but also receives the assistance, support, and direct participation of the broad masses. There must be a conscious awareness of the entire courageous and fighting nation, and a patriotic government that defends the integrity of national territory and the independence and liberation of its own nation. The most important task of national defense drama should also be determined in line with current objective needs. Therefore, its content should also be consistent with its mission.</p>
<p>Even from a historical perspective, from the events caused by the enemy's aggression, or even from the lessons of other national liberation struggles (such as Abyssinia's resistance to Italy and Egypt's anti-British struggle, etc.), we can adopt dramas that express great national defense consolidation power, rather than dramas that are feaudalistic and geographically narrow patriotism!</p>
<p>In terms of methods of expression, we propose that dramas of all schools and forms—Peking Opera, Cantonese Opera, and spoken drama—unite under this goal and use their own unique strengths and special methods of expression to create powerful performances. As long as it is concentrated in this unique and common view, any form can become the form of national defense drama. Therefore, we ask all drama groups and dramatists who do not want to be slaves of a conquered country and who are not traitors to unanimously accept the urgent suggestions of national defense drama.</p>
<h3>Hunger</h3>
<p>— Zhuoer</p>
<p>When a group of lively and energetic children are sent away by the ringing of the end-of-class bell, I feel as if I have lost something precious and am a little melancholy! At the same time, this vast courtyard also becomes quiet, like a wild beast suffocating and crouching down as if it had encountered a strong enemy, not daring to move at all: this courtyard will fall asleep so lifelessly, and will only be awakened by the children's chorus of life the next morning! Then, I will also get warmth, I feel like I have returned to childhood and am full of the desire for life, I sing loudly, I cheer, I re-join the children's team... I hope that tomorrow can come sooner.</p>
<p>I sat at the desk in the teachers' dormitory, thinking about other things, but I could never forget my longing for the children.</p>
<p>I lit a cigarette, hoping that the cigarette would take away my fatigue!</p>
<p>"Sir!—"</p>
<p>This sudden sound startled me, it was so unfamiliar, the dark and hoarse voice was also shaking timidly, when I turned my head to look at him, he opened his eyes so at a loss and nodded to me, as if to ask me to forgive his rudeness.</p>
<p>He was in his late thirties, his beard sticking out like steel needles, he had a strong physique and a tall stature, his face was slightly pale, and his tattered and thin clothes could not stop his body from shivering from the cold, but he still tried his best to calm himself and make himself as calm as an ordinary person.</p>
<p>"Sir!—" This voice was a little louder than the previous one, he wanted to attract my attention, "Is it necessary to eat when people are hungry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, I knew that this was another poor person trapped in hunger and cold.</p>
<p>"What should I do if I don't have food?" He asked me again, intensifying his voice and taking a step closer to me. This was really a bit embarrassing for me, how should I answer him? He continued: "I have tried my best to find a job, but I can't find it after all!"</p>
<p>His tone, so full of emotion, pierced my heart, this is such a serious problem, what I feel in front of me is not just him, but thousands and tens of thousands of countless people who have no work and no food!</p>
<p>"Sir!" —Sir! I still have a wife and two six or seven-year-old children! What crime have they committed?</p>
<p>Children, children, innocent and lively children, oh! I dare not think about it anymore, I only saw him widening his angry eyes and clenching his big fists, he was simply a furious beast! I felt my own insignificance, I couldn't answer what he asked!</p>
<p>"Sir!" We haven't eaten anything that can fill our stomachs for half a week—"</p>
<p>"Do you want me to help you a little?"</p>
<p>"No! Sir, can you help me permanently if you help me temporarily? Can you help thousands and tens of thousands of people like me? Sir, tell me: if I commit a crime for hunger, should this also be considered a crime?"</p>
<p>"No!" I was conquered by him, and I used all my strength to give him the same strong and powerful tone, "It is not a crime to live."</p>
<p>"Okay! Sir, you are right, thank you," he said, nodding again, and a glimmer of hope flashed on his face. He took steady and powerful steps and soon disappeared from the bedroom and from the lonely courtyard.</p>
<p>I miss him, and I miss his two six or seven-year-old children even more.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday morning, and I was walking on the main road in the town. Strangely, everyone was stretching their necks and looking west, as if waiting for a miracle. I walked forward with a suspicion. Not far away, a cluster of people was rolling in like a tide. The county soldiers, with bows drawn and swords sheathed, were escorting a prisoner. The prisoner's face was very familiar. When he walked past me, he nodded to me. Oh! His face was so pale. I remembered that I really knew him. A week ago, I had a determined conversation with him.</p>
<p>People on the street were talking about it: "He also has a wife and two children! He is very poor. A dog will jump over a wall when cornered. He had no choice. He went to rob the restaurant of food. When people came to arrest him, he killed someone with a hammer..."</p>
<p>Isn't that him? I regret! Did I hurt him? But I think my words were right.</p>

<h3>The Turnaround of Life</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>One summer, I took a car from the provincial capital of Shandong to Beiping. The journey was smooth, and I passed through the Zhengyangmen station without any inspection. At that time, my mood was unspeakably pleasant because I hated those troubles.</p>
<p>A rickshaw pulled me along to an apartment in the western city. It was the residence of a friend's friend whom I had only met once. I was preparing to live with such a gentleman. Looking up at the sky, it was so beautiful. I had never seen such a beautiful sky before. I had read Eroshchenko's article before, he was a blind man, and he longed for light. At that time, he lived in Beijing. I thought that if he knew that the sky in Beiping was so beautiful, he would be even more depressed. But on the second day I arrived in Beiping, it started to rain. Once it rained, the sky was completely covered by dense black clouds. The beautiful and bright sky could not be seen, as if it had blinded my eyes. I shouted that I was bored.</p>
<p>"It's so boring, damn it!"</p>
<p>The courtyard was full of water. The raindrops fell lightly and then heavily.</p>
<p>Every house was full of people, and no one went out on rainy days. Some were playing cards, some were playing the huqin, and the fragrance of opium smoke mixed with the voices of girls reciting English passed through. It is not uncommon for Beiping people or people who have lived in Beiping for a long time to hum a few tunes and sing two operas; however, I had never heard of college students smoking opium.</p>
<p>My friend was a very shrewd person. He was also very handsome. Although his life was miserably poor, he was as happy as others. He was an optimistic fellow. So I asked him:</p>
<p>"Do many people smoke opium? You smell it... it's fragrant!"</p>
<p>"A lot. Some college students in Beiping even bring their wives and children; opium is common." He said it to me as a normal thing, which I found interesting; "There are too many remnants of the old dynasty!"</p>
<p>Once, he pointed out a person to me: his face was white, his hair was smooth, and his lips were a little pale.</p>
<p>"This guy does everything, not to mention smoking opium! He's never been to class."</p>
<p>Another day, he told me: there was a fellow villager who played cards all day long; he played with professors and classmates, and his skills were very good. For more than two years, his tuition fees were won from the professors. He also introduced this fellow villager to me, a person who was somewhat coy and like a girl, with white hands and lips like lipstick. Sometimes he wrote some beautiful sentences pieced together into articles, hummed a few small poems that he himself did not understand, and published them in Beiping's small newspapers to get a little meager remuneration.</p>
<p>There were also some people who were opera fans: they even pawned their clothes to go to the opera. When the war at Xifengkou and Gubeikou was so tense, they did not forget to support their favorite actors. It seemed that national affairs were all taken care of by others, and they did not care much.</p>
<p>"Do they prostitute themselves?" I asked my friend, seeing that he had forgotten to tell me about this.</p>
<p>He seemed to blame me for asking too much and said: "Can this be less? Some people are in their twenties and have lived in Beiping for three or five years; if they don't have a wife, where do they go if they don't prostitute themselves?" And he told me to recall that once when we went to Zhongshan Park to play, we saw many couples, "Some of those men and women are lovers, couples, and some are prostitutes, students, and professors!"</p>
<p>I seemed to have been brought into a place that was completely different from my life and thoughts. I was not interested in these things and could not do them. What would I do living among such people in the future? But this friend had already spent two or three years there. Others had also spent countless months. I thought, he must have lived like this too: I asked him: "What about you?"</p>
<p>"Me?" He smiled coldly, "I'm not qualified: damn it, poverty has deprived me of all my rights, I can't go to the park often, I can't go to the opera, I can't play with women, even playing cards, people don't want to play with me because they see I have no money to lose. Other things are even harder to say. You'll know in a few days, life here is also interesting and also boring."</p>
<p>"Then, what do you do every day? What about those who don't go to school?"</p>
<p>"I just go to school or the library. Some people, they don't even have a home, not even a public dormitory. They just find a friend's house to sleep in. When they wake up in the morning, they run out early. You know the National Library, right? They go there, wash their faces, defecate, drink water, climb over the low stone railings to Beihai Park, or just take a walk in the library, and then go inside to read the newspapers, read magazines, read books, write articles, translate articles, whatever you want, until it closes in the evening!"</p>
<p>"What about eating? Don't you have to find a place?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that easy to find? There are many, many near the school. And you can run up a tab."</p>
<p>He said in a sighing tone: "Some people are really miserable, they are simply plagued by hunger and cold all day long. Winter in Beiping is especially cold, so they can only run into the library!" His eyes moved flexibly. Tears welled up in the corners of his eyes, as if he was about to cry. Therefore, I didn't want to ask him anything else. Perhaps it was because his life had pressed him too hard, and he was too sad to pour out his hardships to a fellow villager with whom he had a relatively close relationship. I could only say: "This kind of life is interesting!"</p>
<p>"Maybe," he said, "poverty can make people healthy. In the crucible of poverty, I don't know how many people have been tempered. Their bones have become iron, and their hearts have become steel. No one can subdue them! Only such people can do something. Listen, the card table is opening up again, and the huqin is playing again... but when the Japanese planes come a few times, they get scared!"</p>
<p>At the same time, the fragrance of opium smoke wafted over.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Bottle</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>At night, under the lamplight, I would see it. Time has been very long, and I have never heard it say a word to me. I have never given it a bit of warmth. It always puts on a silent face, opens its small mouth that turns from deep blue to black, as if expecting something—perhaps endless melancholy—a familiar and greedy thing is inserted into its small mouth; yes, this greedy thing is the pen I hold in my hand. Now, I realize that my selfish desires are so cruel, never adding a bit of thought or consideration, directing the pen in my hand to draw a large amount of resources from its small mouth that turns from deep blue to black, to create a little bit of embellishment for life. Shouldn't I be ashamed? For this lonely companion who has been with me night after night, it has now been sacrificed to my selfish desires.</p>
<p>Who can guarantee its future fate? Is it going to be abandoned forever in a dark corner covered in dust? And I can only give a regretful sigh—soon this messy floor will have a new companion to follow its fate, spending lonely nights together in the long years to come.</p>

The little maid Xueyan is brewing pleasant tea. Daiyu knows she is lacking a confidant. In her heart, she is 觸 (觸 means touched) and her eyes are full of tears. Suddenly she hears the parrot calling, saying a guest is knocking on the door calling for the maid Juan. She urgently orders the maid to go outside the room and ask who has come to hear the news. The maid obeys the order and opens the door. She sees that it is Baoyu coming and she feels touched. Because he comes at night, it is a rare thing, showing his amorousness and righteousness, making him a great man. She hurriedly takes the lantern and leads him in with light footsteps. She walks to the bedside and reports, saying that Master Bao has come alone tonight. He has come in person to visit you. Your servant welcomes him on behalf of the master with a sincere heart. He has come to your bedside to see you. What grievances do you have that you would like him to judge? Daiyu listens, with a hundred feelings welling up. It is as if she has seen the sun after a long rain. She has thousands of words to say, but from where should she start? She barely calls out "Older cousin" softly. Saying that aunt Xue bullies me too much. I am full of sorrow and sickness, and it makes me want to sacrifice my life. Although the old matriarch treats me kindly, I have a disease and it is difficult to have justice. Do not expect that my body can be free of medicine. I am afraid that we will meet again in the next life and form an alliance on the mountains. Baoyu listens and is alarmed in his heart. He advises her not to argue with the Wang family. To protect her body and seek well-being, to cast aside all things, and to hope for good fortune. After watching, he takes his leave. It is difficult to make a fuss about the injustice. He can only sing a few verses of this opening.</p>
