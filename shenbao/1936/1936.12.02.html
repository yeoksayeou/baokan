<h3 id="c61">東京通訊　議會改革聲中之日政黨（下） <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>所以這次從軍部提出的議會改革案，不僅是對政黨示威而巳，在加强日本統治階級之力量這一點上說，也是很有　義的。最近之行政機構改革，其政治性，旣已充分表示出統合性的傾向，若不改革議會制度，不縮小議會權限，則代表大多數民衆之利益的政黨，將有組閣之可能，那統治階級，豈不是將要感受困難嗎？於此，議會改革案，以及議會政治之否認，事實上，絕不能形成日本統治階級間的衝突，而是瞪明了日本社會的思想對立，益趨尖銳。與其說這是對已成政黨之攻擊，無寗說這是對未成政黨之防範。阻止人民戰綫運動之進展和左傾政黨之出現，這在目前的日本統治階級，自然是很必要。所以，政民兩黨，現在雖然高唱護憲，但結果，是不難想像而知的。</p>
<p>除了政民兩大政黨外，社大黨和「國民同盟」的態度，也有一說的必要。「國民同盟」的本身，已經顯明的法西斯蒂化，所以與軍部沒有甚麽衝突。十一月七日，該黨總裁安達氏發表談話，大意是『近時議會改革之聲，令諸政黨焦燥狼狽。對此種事，政黨不能不自戒自省。第一，今日之政黨，巳無指導國家之國策和熱情。第二，過去數年來，政黨均抱追隨政府之態度·第三，政黨黨員，不免有腐敗行爲。』此外，安達氏還指摘了現內閣之對華外交，頗多遣慷。由此，也可看出，他與軍部是一鼻孔出氣的了。</p>
<p>社大黨，在名義上，本是代表勤勞大衆的。應當是站在最前綫，藉政黨的力量，和軍部鬥爭的了。但是，社大黨已不能担負這使命了。社大黨幹部的法西斯蒂色彩，已帶得很濃厚。前些時，軍部禁止陸軍工廠從業員，加入工會組織，社大黨當時也曾嚷着要鬥爭，但結果，是銷聲匿跡了。那怕這一次是關於政黨——特別是勤勞大衆的黨——的生死關頭，但社大黨幹部，也必將是不執行鬥爭的職務的。</p>
<p>鬥爭的力量，將在別一方面展開，、將因此事而促進各政黨的分化。由思想的對立，而形成兩個鮮明的不同的戰錢。</p>
<p>十一月五日，民政黨的少壯派，因不滿意黨首腦部的軟弱態度，特組織「民政護憲代議士會」，開始積極行動，决定鞭撻黨首腦部及黨出身的閣僚，實行下列决議：</p>
<p>（一）宣揚立憲政治之本義，撲滅法西斯蒂思想。</p>
<p>（二）排斥現役軍人干涉政治。</p>
<p>（三）發揮議會權能，提高政黨之作用。</p>
<p>伺時，政友會的一部份黨員，也組織院外團，發起護憲運動，與民政黨的少壯派相呼應。十日午後六時，兩黨院外團，已在新橋東洋軒開過了聯合懇談會，决議聯合發起護憲大運動，並通過下列各議案：</p>
<p>（一）絕對反對縮小議會權限，否認政黨之企圖。</p>
<p>（二）反對現役軍人干與政治。</p>
<p>（三）排擊官僚之越權陰謀。</p>
<p>（四）鞭撻政黨幹部，一致覺醒，擁護憲政。</p>
<p>與此相對，十一日午後三時，民政黨首腦部，也在黨本部召集幹部會。决議調査所謂議會改革案之眞相，希望少壯派自重，勿孟浪從事。首腦部的這種行動，能收到如何的效果，這固然要待以後事實的證明。但無論如何，不能不說這是黨的分裂視象吧。</p>
<p>此外，與此事伴相呼應的，是最近日本區會議的選舉，在巳經發表的地方，候補者當中，無產派佔極鮮明的優勢。這和目前的議會問題，在將來，直接間接總楚會發生影響的。</p>
<p>最後，就引朝日新聞上今日之問題中的幾句話，來做本文的結束吧。</p>
<p>『在議事堂的內部，正舉行着盛大莊嚴的竣工典禮。在議事堂的外部呢？國民大衆，正在非常時的重壓下，感受着焦燥和苦惱。』</p>
<h3 id="c62">英國處交的戰略（上） <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 英國Walter　Scobell作　虞爾昌譯</p>
<p>英帝國已臨到一個嚴重的關頭，這是共見的事實。我們的（著者自稱，下同）政府是很明白這情形的。然則政府的人們到底在想些什麽呢？他們將怎樣應付當前的危局呢？他們是否依然沒有定見，或已有着積極的政策？他們所將决定的戰略是怎樣的？把這些問題加以考慮而獲得一點消息，是値得做的工作吧。</p>
<p>我想首先指出，在英政府的背後，有幾條基本的原則，指導着它一切的行動。對於這幾條原則，英國統治階級的意見是一致的；只是在這些原則的運用上，他們有時或發生意見的分歧。其次，我們的統治者們是很敏感的，他們能很快地看到四周的意　和變化，而謀迅速的適應。因此，當前世界的情勢也是爲我們所要深切注意的。世界的情勢時刻在變動之中，我們的政府也就適應着這　變動的情勢，而運用它的原則，以决定它的外交戰略。我們要想知道在這長期紛擾的國際關係中，英國所扮演的角色，和在這難關當前時英政府所將擇取的路徑，就不得不先問一問：</p>
<p>（一）在英國統治階級背後的那幾條固定不變的基本原則是什麼？</p>
<p>（二）時刻在改變這世界的那些新興的和正在成長中的勢力是怎樣的？</p>
<p>現在先把第一個問題的答案寫出來。自從資本主義興起之後，支配着英國的外交的有這幾條主要的原則：</p>
<p>（一）掌握海上覇權。</p>
<p>（二）保持海洋上的戰爭根據地和燃料站。</p>
<p>（三）保持國際間的均勢。</p>
<p>上面三條傳統的原則，直到現在是仍被緊握着的。它們之間有着不能分離的關係。英帝國的大厦是全仗它們的支撑的。此外尙有一條，便是自由貿易與「門戶開放」，但自大戰終了，已經被取消了。</p>
<p>二十世紀初期以來，因時勢的要求，又出現了兩條新的原則：</p>
<p>（四）第一條原則，因爲沒有更好的名稱，姑且稱它爲「援助的需要」（Needfor　support）吧。一九〇二年英日同盟的開談，卽是這原則第一次的運用。英日同盟的成立，在英國是自墜其威信的，因爲這暗示着英國已沒有力量單獨維持海上的覇權了。不過這並未表明英國業巳放棄了海上的覇權，而只是它對於第（一）條原則的修正。前面已經說過，我們統治階級是善於適應四周的情勢的。這同盟的許多明顯的不利，最大的如英帝國威信的失墜，就是在一九〇二年訂的的當初，早已爲我們的政府所見釗了。然而同盟是成立了，而且後來史展期了，這是爲的什麽呢？一則，日本是一個新興的海上勢力，又遠在東亞，爲英帝國的海軍勢力所不容易達到的。這情形，不待日俄戰爭的决勝，我們的遠見的政治家們却早就看淸楚了。二則，在一九一四年以前，爲要準備戰爭而避免國力的過度消耗，那樣的修正也是不得已的。雖然，這一修正到底是證明着英帝國自信的動搖，和它在亞洲方面需要援助的切迫。一個孤立的海上覇權畢竟是超出帝國力量之上了。這對於我們的統治階級是感到痛苦的，何况它更　英國外交的道路上撒了不少的荊棘。</p>
<p>（五）第二條新原則是「資本主義的保護」（Defenceof　Caputalism）。這條原則更包含着對於一切反動勢力——不管在何地出現或以什麽形態出現——的普遍的贊助，和對於任何前進勢力——不管是政治上或經濟上的民主主義，自治制度，殖民地解放運動，國際主義，敎育的發展或社會主義——的一律的敵視。這其實是第（三）條原則——維持均勢——的修正與補充。在十九世紀，英帝國主義的面目誠然是兇狠的，但是它多少還帶有幾　自由主義的色彩。那時，它是異常的自信，所以並不操切。但是情勢激變着。資本主義自身的發展，和美國資本主義的勃興，使它頓失固有的地位，因此動搖了一向的自信。而社會主義在蘇聯的成功，更使它現出了跳牆的窘態。於是我們的聰明的統治者們揭　出「保護資本主義」的旅幟，以修好於外强中乾的法西國家，以爲如此可以重　國際間的均勢而保全自己的地位。</p>
<p>我們現在要看一看當前世界的情勢是怎樣的了。爲求明晰起見，現在連同那些基本原則，列舉在下面：</p>
<p>基本原則：</p>
<p>（一）掌握海上霸權。</p>
<p>（二）保持海洋上的戰爭根據地和燃料站。</p>
<p>（三）保持國際間的均勢</p>
<p>（四）獲得援助。</p>
<p>（五）保護資本主義。</p>
<p>世界情勢：</p>
<p>（六）美帝國生義的成長。</p>
<p>（七）共產主義在法國及西班牙的影響。</p>
<p>（八）日本在工業上所取的攻勢。</p>
<p>（九）日本在軍備上所取的攻勢。</p>
<p>（十）德國的重返世界政治舞台。</p>
<p>（十一）空軍的出現。</p>
<p>（十二）民族主義的興起</p>
<p>（十三）殖民地的醒覺。</p>
<p>（十四）國聯制度與集體安全的觀念。</p>
<p>（十五）社會主義在蘇聯的成功和它的國際化。</p>
<p>在影響世界大局的各種因素之中，我們可以看出有五種是局部的，或者是受國界的限制的；又有五種是一般的，或者是國際件質的（當然係就比較而言）。爲求簡短計，我不曾把在目前尙未佔重要地位的各種因素列入表內。例如意大利的建設「東菲帝國」的夢想，顯然對於我們是一個重大的威嚇。但是我們的外交部的估計是很實際的。一九一五至一九一八這幾年間把意國暴露出是一個債務超過於債權的國家，而我們的外交家們不相信法西主義能使意國返老還童的。所以目前意大利的威嚇也許還沒有被放在仙們的心上。但是　國空軍的發展和它在地中海上所取的敵視態度畢竟是不應忽視的。這待到後來當我們注意到第（五）條原則——保護資本主義——的運用時，就要　出它的重要了。</p>

<h3 id="c63">泛美和平會議開幕 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>泛美和平會議已於昨天在阿根廷京城開幕了。在全世界的侵略主義者聯合一致向和平之神進攻的時候。美洲的二十一個國家能在和平殿堂中提手言。歡討論西半球的和平組織問題。這不能不說是一個可喜的消息。</p>
<p>這次泛美和平會議。是由美總統羅斯福於本年一月底發起召集的。所以在行開幕禮時。這位聯任的「白宮主人。」也不辭僕僕的跋涉。親往出席。羅總統爲什麼要召集這次和平會議。並且這樣重視它呢。簡單的說。這次會議的召集。是在於推行美國的善隣政策。與出賣商業互惠協定。我們知道美國對於拉丁美洲的政策。以前是堅守狹義的孟羅主義的。這種侵略性質之孟羅主義的嚴厲執行。祇會激起各小國的反美情緒。因此到了羅斯颺總統時代。就丟棄這種「大棍子主義。」而改採溫言軟語的善隣政策了。這種善隣政策的背後。自然不免含有金融勢力向外發展的要求。這只要一看赫爾國務卿之帶着商業互惠恊定前往南美出賣。就可知道了。</p>
<p>不管美國召集這次和平會議的背後作用如何。我們如就和平會議的本身而論。則於國際和平運動的推進。是有極大帮助的。因爲這次會議中討論的主要議題。是怎樣促進美洲的和平組織。在過去。美國共訂有四種和平的條約。不過都沒有廣大的國家參加。所以力量不大。在這次會議中。各國代表常必進一步的討論怎樣增進這些和平條約力量的辦法。甚至會更進一步的組織美洲的國際聯盟。也說不定。這種和平的努力。自然是有助於整個國際和平的促進的。</p>
<p>有許多人以爲泛美和平會議的開幕。將與日內瓦國際聯盟採取敵對的形勢。其實這是不甚確切的。因爲羅斯福的外交政策。含有極濃厚的國際合作頌向。過去四年的歷史。就是很好的例證。相反的。美洲各國之進一步的合作。卻可使美國對日內瓦的關係。通過南美洲各小國的拉攏。而更密切起來。何况區域安全制度。實爲整個集體安全制度的初步。所以泛美和平會議對於國際和平運動的推進。是有很大的意義的。</p>
<p>美洲各國的合作。不但對於國際和平有很大的影響。而且對於遠東局勢的發展。也有重大的關係。我們知道羅斯福總統近年厲行巨艦大砲政策。這巨艦大砲政策的背後。就是對付西太平洋局勢的發展的。但在實行對付遠東的侵略者之前。自不能不先調整美洲各國的關係。而這次泛美會議的召集。實含有這種團結內部的重大意義。</p>

<p>（東京）本陸軍省日前發表小冊子一種、內容頗關重要、茲略述如下、日本軍隊力量雖精神原質極為優越、但與蘇俄遠東紅軍相較、在數額上未免相形見拙、由軍略立塲言、最危險之事實、當英過於日本駐「滿洲國」軍隊之過少、蓋無論如何日軍與蘇俄平時遠束駐軍、必須維持相近之平衡、該小冊中有一章述及國防力量之最低限度、內稱、鑒於蘇俄與中國之兵力、可見日本在大陸之軍備極不完備、為避免戰禍及維持日本在大陸上之生命綫起見、重整軍備一事、實為緊急之要務、一國所需要之兵力、須以其平時之政策、國家之現狀、及與他國之關係决定之、倘使蘇俄能置於疆塲之兵力、果如各國所臆測之强大、則日本目下之兵力、無論其訓練如何精銳、策略如何優異、紀律如何嚴明、亦難以抵補其數額過少之弊，允須注意者卽未來之戰　中、機械及科學上之設備、將日趨重要蘇俄遠束軍力在平時共計十五師、飛機一千架分為一百餘隊、坦克車亦有千輛左右、此外蘇俄更於邊境之區建築極堅固之砲壘、對於昆鄰之「滿洲國」、隨時有侵略之可能、返觀日本在滿軍力、又何如乎、按數字而論只及蘇俄三分之一、或四分之一、至於飛機及坦克車、更遠非蘇俄之比、日本仗此微弱之軍力、巡視蜿蜓三千哩之邊境、維持面積等於德法兩國領土之和平與秩序、並警備長逾六千哩之鐵道綫、蘇俄軍隊沿俄滿邊境一帶駐紮者係一種軍略上之分區警備、面日軍之散處各地、乃屬不敷分配之現象總之、日本駐滿鮮之軍隊、平時必須具有警備邊境、維持治安、及巡視鐵道綫之充分力量、戰時更須抵抗敵人之侵犯、須知沿邊戰事初起時之勝負、對於整個戰局、將有嚴重之影響、今為謀邊境防務之鞏固計、俄滿沿邊軍隊、自非具有充分之捍衛不可、吾人為鞏固亞洲大陸之防務、及萬一與蘇俄發生戰事時第一綫得有完全之保護起見、日本駐軍實有按蘇俄軍力之比例遞加之必要、</p>
<p>在未來可能的戰事中、大的敵機當戰爭爆發之後、立卽企圖空襲東京及日本各主要軍事軍火根據地、倘使日本在開始之時、卽缺乏此項空襲之能力、則最後必致慘收而後已、是以陸軍之外、日本之空軍、亦須加以積極之擴充、</p>
<p>現代戰爭中空軍之重要、為明顯之事、實母待贅述、但同是亦為防止戰爭之重大要素、英國海軍力遠在意大利之上、而其地中海之艦隊、所以不敢以、極端手段對付意大利艦隊者、實由於意之空軍超過英國故也、由此而觀、日本空軍之補充、確為刻不容緩之急務、</p>
<p>最後又提及國家行政之須刷新、謂國內行政如入軌道、則日本自能與蘇俄作軍備之競爭、該小冊子內刋有蘇俄飛機降落傘及坦克車之照片多幀、並附地圖一幅、詳示遠東各重要軍區、（路透通訉）</p>

<p>傳氏鎭靜</p>
<p>傅作義將軍、以身為綏省主席、且兼三十五軍軍長、一切概親自主持、自剿匪軍興以來、熊度鎭靜安閒、身衣上將軍服、終日不解、一而忙於調度軍事一面勤於酬應、而態度　若毫無倦容、當計劃攻百靈廟一役二日未眠、故面部已稍瘦、至綏遠地方在軍事未發動前人心微覺恐慌、匪擾並擊潰後、人心反見安定、地方一如平日、毫無戰事狀態、命融亦極穩定、惟對旅客則盤　甚嚴、自大同至綏遠一帶火車中、時有憲兵檢查、對旅客姓氏來歷、　詳加考詢、以防　細乘機混入、</p>

<p>王英匪部各懷異志</p>
<p>王英匪部、自紅鎭敗後、愈為某方所輕視、其部衆亦懷異志、本月二十六日夜王與尹寳山秘密會議、當時因意見不合、幾至當塲决裂、其餘中下級各軍官、連日亦有密商、某方對之更疑、現已派李守信部監視王等行動、至王之部下、現尙有三千餘人、王已派其親信六十餘人、於二十八日由商都首途潛入內地密秘招兵、</p>

<p>籃球健將李震中、被辛隊邀請於今晨由京來滬、今晚即出席西靑籃球賽、助剿信通海賊隊、徐兆熊亦决定參加、當爲辛隊增厚實力不少、査本屆之信通、自史密斯缺席後、實力大遜、前晚並幾敗於黃蜂、此次出征南京、兩戰俱敗、是以今晚之戰、辛隊旣得李徐二君之助、不難一舉而滅歷年冠軍信通海賊隊也、今晚秩序如下、</p>
<p>靑光對麥令甲（獨）八時</p>
<p>辛隊對信通　（獨）九時前晚兩塲、競爭形勢均甚緊張、南菁對南洋、上半時成十三比十三之平手、下半時南洋曾一度以二十比十八、及二十一比十九佔先、入後被南菁追出、成二十九比二十一、歸南菁勝利、另一塲爲信通對黃蜂、信通因長脚闌茵之缺席、實力大减、黃蜂自知不敵、而亡命抵抗、上半時信通雖以十八比十二佔先、但下半時中黃蜂大爲活躍、着着爭先、分數遞加不已、果然在最後二分鏑時、由章文元投中一球、以二十三比二十二、反超前一分、斯時如能鎮靜應付、不難出一冷鬥、而將信通打敗、無奈窮人得志、反而手忙脚亂、一再犯規、被連罰九决、幸信通亦以求勝心切、意志慌張、僅中一分、成二十三之平手、最後因卡遜之一投、始以二十五比二十三幸勝黃蜂、</p>
<p>昨晚兩塲大學組、均爲一面倒形勢、復旦之勝約翰、上半時頗爲緊張、而下半時的翰殊不得志、總結被復旦以四十六比二十八勝、次塲持志演出殊佳、該隊曾勝曁南與復旦、儼然執有海上大學籃球盟主之勢、三前鋒之籃下工作、海上可稱獨步、更以對手同濟守衛之軟弱、益爲得心應手、結果爲四十八比二十五、但上半時持志亦僅勝二分耳、各祖成績如下、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份巿面、又呈狂漲狀態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又好一角零、坎拿大好三四角、利物浦好一辨士零、世界麥價、旣見步漲、國內小麥、又復落令、且各種物價、均有漲無跌、跟求背景、彷彿全世界均爲戰雲所籠罩致人心惴惴、積草囤糧、大有急不暇擇、一致以原貨爲準備、市面之騰貴莫非皆根據於此也、當開價、本月份卽猛提八分、旋卽續好二分、而一盤中卽回落二三分、一月份開始、初尙漲七八分、至四月份較前月份竟漲一角、因此二盤以後、除本月尙差二厘半、餘則均漲到一角、半日成交達七八十萬、迨至下午開盤、交易所對於證金、又臨時增爲五百元、而各月份市氣、因有一角之限盤、故成交已少、無形停頓、觀此種市價、爲自有交易所以來之最高紀錄、而四週環境、依然無從救濟、所以前途風波、實非通常之推臆、所能逆料云、</p>
<h3 id="c117">洋麥不絕上漲　本麥漲度空前　四月期已至六元九角二 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、上午開盤、各月份市面、暴漲之烈、彷彿又達沸達、因洋麥報價、自前月底及昨日報吿、一致繼漲、尤以利物浦爲更甚、此種情形、無異爲全世界一致軍事準備之暗不、且不但小麥繼漲無已、國內之各種油價、亦復一步一趨、故開價後、人心大爲衝動、本月份開價卽暴提一角三四分、一月份以下、亦跟漲一角二三分至一角八分、迨至下午開盤、因粉市漲勢甚厲、各月份均漲至限價、是以買氣更盛、賣方除舊多回出、絕少新空、故各月份又續漲五六七分、如四月份之漲度、達二角半、市面之最高峯、竟到六元九角二分、漲度空前、物價亦屬創見也、現麥巿面、貨客居奇、見交甚少、普通高貨開六元二角、次至零九分、計有千餘包交易云、</p>

<p>昨油豆餅標準巿價一致在漲、因國際戰雲愈濃、各國均有儲糧之傳說、且大連電報亦復接連上漲、昨日豆價報漲角外、油漲半元許、餅漲四分、因此市塲人心莫不激昂、更以花紗跟漲甚鉅、益使買方興奮、行號各方面已不敢拋出、故晨間開價立即飛騰、雖一度被舊多頭了結壓平、然以新囤進胃甚濃、結果仍見上漲、收價標油漲四角半至七角半、標豆漲一角七分及二三角不等、標餅亦大三五六分云、</p>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因大連漲風仍熾、本市交易所標準豆開盤、卽　騰一二角、致現貨豆油行情續升二角、豆餅砌分譜、故黃豆市價再度上漲四五分、但榨油廠因見價格續昂、對於納胃不免减色、故昨市漲度見微、昨計做開四平街豆七車、漢口乍豆三千包、安慶豆一千五百包、其餘各豆由本街等辦去七八百包云、</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源四十三號、市上去胃揀巧者稍有動辦、白粳早巿價軟三四分、晚巿見定、薄稻到貨有限、津烟大連各帮動辦不息、本街胃口尙可、價形挺緊、羊尖價緊二三分、埠杆尖價堅定、陰變元和平、其餘各米與前相仿、</p>

<p>至後巿雙方相持不下迄未開拍</p>
<p>紗市狂漲、鋒鋩萬丈、張勢銳不可當、蓋以現紗根子奇缺、客方進胃頗健、於是買風掀起、且有新的投機商投奔而來、猛烈狂購、吸收殊强、一般浮空、鑒於環境不良、均不限價忍痛斬結、因此市價飛騰、各月一致因漲停板、午後仍相持不下、一盤未能開拍、此種景象、爲交易所開幕以來所未見也、</p>

<p>鼓勵回國投資</p>
<p>海外僑胞、雖在經濟崩潰氛圍中、究以根基已固、經濟力量、尙可有爲、故近來回國投資僑胞、不减於前、且見增加、因在外經營事業情勢之轉變、對僑胞回國投資、當予以鼓勵、至於僑胞移資國內後、在海外活動資本、是吾將發生問題、當予以計劃及培植、培植資源方法、不應只從正面經營個人財產着想、當導我僑民使之互助一切社會糾織、合現代經濟之原則、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>上海婦女界組織之婦女服用國貨會，於十一月十一日成立以後，曾開第一次理事會，討論一切進行方針，舉其大者：</p>
<p>（一）與各女學校校長聯絡，請其領導全校女生，一致加入婦女服用國貨會，並由女生全體動員，向其家屬勸吿一致服用國貨。</p>
<p>（二）與各國貨工廠聯絡，所有各家庭服用之意見與訪問之所得，對於各工廠出品上不滿意之點，切實貢獻，希望漸决改進：同時對於國貨公司店員對待顧客之服務，感到種種不滿意之處，亦儘量請其注意改良。</p>
<p>（三）社會各界聯絡，請其致力於國貨之提倡，同時希望女界平日服用之貨，尙未有國產者，趕速設法自製，以免利權外益。</p>
<p>（四）推派陸禮華女士赴皖贛鄂湘各省勸導組織服用國貨會，以資聯絡。自此議案發布以後，聞各地極多響應，各女學校校長、亦已在校從事組織國貨服用團及勸用國貨團之舉，陸禮華女士分赴各省考察之結果，各地紛紛組織服用國貨會風發雲湧，前途氣象極佳。吾人認為婦女服用國貨會，更宜注意下列二事：</p>
<p>第一　調查各地國貨之銷路情形，當地婦女界對於國貨之意見，與國貨之是否足用？抑或僅有外貨，而尚無國貨可購。</p>
<p>第二　親往各廠接洽，對於出品上作實地這研究，何部宜改良，何部宜變通，何部宜注意，均須以細針密縷工夫，作切實之商　。</p>
<h3 id="c199">冬與國貨 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>冬來了，冬是一年之中最末了的一個時節：也是一般人購買力最旺的一個時節。添置棉織的衣衫，購備冬令的補品，籌辦冬季的禮物，大多都在這個冬李剛扌開始的時候，預先來計劃和籌備的。所以在冬令開始降臨的時候，熱心於提倡國貨運動的同志們，假如能利用這個機會，來對一般的親戚朋友們，做一下服用國貨的宣傳，其效力定比寫幾篇國貨文字，來得宏大得多，這是可以斷定的。</p>
<p>我以為：在這一般人正想籌辦冬令用品的時候，我們不妨介紹他們幾樣眞正道地的國貨，請他們去試用：用得滿意的，老實不　氣的請他多多購用，而目還要勸導他所認識的親戚朋友，大家一齊來提倡，一齊來服用。試用得有缺點的地方，也不妨請他儘量的貢獻出來，以便作為改進的張本。譬如購置衛生杉，我們可以介紹採購五和織造廠的鵝牌衛生衫，和景綸衫襪廠的爵牌衛生衫，不特軟和適體，而且經久耐用。譬如雪花膏，我們可以介紹他們購用家庭工業社的蝶霜，中國化學工業社的時代霜，以及永和實業公司的白雪。假如因為冬季多雨，需要購備套鞋，那水，大可以介紹他去購買大中華橡膠廠的雙錢牌和正泰橡膠廠的回力球牌萬里牌，以及義生橡膠廠的堅固牌等等，諸如此類東西，我們實在可以舉一反三的儘量介紹些著名的國貨工廠的出名，給一般的親戚朋友們，做一個　　　時的參考</p>
<p>總而言之，廢話也母　多說，現在事實擺在面前，冬天已經來臨了。怎樣來推進這個冬令的國貨運　？如何使國貨事業，在這購買力吒的冬　裏，得到長足的進展？這是當前一個値得研究的問題。同時也是　們關心國貨運動的人們，所應切急注意　。　　說：我們不要回想過去，也不必夢想未來，而要牢牢的抓住現實，因為現實是最最値得寳貴的。」</p>
<p>提倡國貨，的確也很　要抓住現實，願大家努力勸導，別放過了這個大有可為的冬令的國貨運動。</p>
<h3 id="c200">婦女服用國貨會成立後 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 兪玉樹</p>
<p>籌備經年的　上海婦女服用國貨會，巳於十一月十一日下午舉行成立的儀式之後宣吿正式誕生了。</p>
<p>提倡國貨須從女界同胞着手，這意義以前說的人很多，所以在婦女國貨年之後，中華國貨產銷協會就在本年春間舉行新春交誼會的時候，發起招待婦女界同胞，組織婦女服用國貨會，當時立願書加入的已很多，這半年來，經國貨女訪問員的努力奔走，加入的日見衆多，到現在幾有近千的會員了。</p>
<p>上海的國貨團體雖多，但婦女組織的這還是創舉，所以我想在該會成立以後，貢獻些個人的意見：</p>
<p>一·須要身體力行　我們同胞有個普遍的病根，就是凡事都抱敷衍馬虎主義。有人呌我加人一個團體，當時因情面難却馬馬虎虎的答應下來，過後從不和那團體接近，永遠成個一名譽的會員」。這態度我們應當把它糾正過來，尤其是加入了這婦女服用國貨會之後，不單是掛個名，簽了張願書所可敷衍的！要知道服用國貨，這是我們的義務，肯定地說，也可算是我們的權利，我們是中國人，不能放棄服用中國貨的權利，當我立誓加入這會之後，更應當守着會的信條，本身固需服用國貨推而廣之，使整個的家庭，也都是國貨。查入會的會員，多數是家庭的主婦，假若她們都能遵守這信條，很快的可以使每個家庭所使用的都是淸一色的國貨。</p>
<p>二·應當擴大組織。現在的會員無論在質和量上都顯見得不够。西安現有個婦女服用國貨會，那裏有會員三萬餘人；這以　　的　口比例相較，我們　當儘量的使它發　　而且今後徵求的範圍，應當擴大至於一般的　　主婦，店員，　工，以及其他各階　的消費份子，宣傳愈普遍，參加的愈多，則收效亦自宏。</p>
<p>再則，看　女服用國貨會的名義，在整個的闕貨事業上還祗站在消費者一方面，假若她們能更積極的推動生產工作，使國貨工業發揚光大，　新月異，那更筆者所企望的了！</p>
<h3 id="c201">已涼天氣未寒時　向同胞們作一個提議 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>光陰迅速，轉瞬又是秋凉天氣了！在這「已凉天氣未寒時」的現在，大家又都忙着製備秋冬衣了。所以我謹向全國的同胞們來一個提議。當然，在本刊發表的稿子，自然是屬於國貨的。我這篇稿子，自然不能例外。</p>
<p>提倡國貨這口號，吶喊了巳有三四年之久，國貨年的旗幟，也　打起了好幾年，然而我們的成績是怎樣呢？雖然不能說是絕對的沒有，可是詳細的檢查一下，却也可憐得很。尤其是現在，舶來品的貨物，已經充滿了市塲，而某國貨更是活躍非常，反顧國貨呢？却反充滿了死氣，一切的一切，眞是好不愁悶人也。</p>
<p>無論幹什麼事情，我們必須本着百折不撓的精神，提倡國貨自然也是這樣，所以我們要冉接再厲的來幹，在現在，巳經是秋凉時候了！我們同胞中，有不少的要製備秋衣或是冬衣，我希望大家下一個决心，在製備秋冬衣的時候，不要忘了提倡國貨四個字。固然，我們一個人提倡國貨的　量，是很微末的。可是聚大多數的力量，可就非常的厚了。譬如全中國四萬萬人裏面，有四千萬人製備秋冬衣，再以平均每人一元計算，則為　千萬元。如果全購國貨，則四千萬元就司以作為國貨廠商的發展事業之用，如果全購舶來品，則此四千萬元，將成為國家的漏巵，而國貨廠商也就會受到重大的打擊。這就是一聚沙成塔，」「集腋成裘」的意思。</p>
<p>同胞們！希望大家不要造成一文錢的漏巵，我正在虔誠的默禱着。</p>

<p>— 憶梅</p>
<p>增加國貨的效力，推廣國貨的銷路，除力謀品質精良外，並要力求貨價低廉，那麼扌能使國貨深入民間去。</p>
<p>現在時令已交入寒冬，人們都要採辦冬令的用品，製造冬令品的國貨廠家，就應該注意到這一點；萬不宜使貨低價高，以致錯過了推銷的機會，而造成舶來品的抬頭——</p>
<p>熱水瓶也是冬令主要的用品，國貨當中像地球脾熱水瓶（五洲藥房製造）品質和效力都很好，不過從前售價還嫌稍貴，聽說最近已經减售每只國幣四角，以期一般人都可以購用；像這　使國貨平民化的態度，確實是値得一提的呢。</p>

<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>話到『傀儡』，便不免要感相當的痛心，因為中國人具有傀儡性的太多了，同時，國家所受到的傀儡的影響，却也不能算小。然而很可憐！那些在作傀儡的人，還當做是在實行提攜而感激涕零呢。</p>
<p>傀儡，在北方人稱做『大台宮戲』，或呼『托偶』，南方人就四作『本人頭戲』。至於中國傀儡的發明，還遠在紀元前九百餘年的周穆王時代，在列子那部書裏，載有名偃師者，製土偶，被以人服，持之而舞，偶使目引王之左右，王不知其戲，大怒欲殺之，偃師懼，亟毀土偶，乃丹砂膠漆所製。又漢高祖聽了陳平之計，刻木美人舞圍城上，以炫關氏，關氏懼其奪寵，令冒頓解圍，高祖乃得這斾。自唐逮宋，傀儡的種類日進繁盛，有懸絲傀儡，走線傀儡，藥發傀儡，杖頭傀儡，肉傀儡，水傀儡等，各種名稱，差不多與俳優戲劇，同樣的發達了，又考諸家載籍，傀儡又名窟儡子，亦稱魁　子，又名郭禿，又稱郭公，唐朝的傀儡戲裏，又有郭郎，總之，無非是供人玩弄的東西罷了。</p>
<p>詠傀儡詩，我人所能知道的，有唐明皇的一首，和韓伲胄族子的一首。唐明皇的詩，是為李輔國遷於西內時作的，詩是：刻木牽絲作老翁，雞皮鶴發與真同，須臾弄罷寂無事，還是人生一夢中。宋人龐平英談藪載：『韓伲胄置宴於南園，族子判院與焉。席間有獻牽絲傀儡為土偶負小兒者，名為迎春黃胖，韓願族子，汝能詩，可詠。即承命詠一絕曰：腳踏虛空手弄春，一人頭上要安身，忽然綫斷兒童手，骨肉都為陌上塵。韓大不樂。』這兩首詩真好極了。『須臾弄罷寂無事，還仍人生一夢中。』『忽然線斷兒童手，骨肉都為陌上塵，』寄語甘作兒皇帝和認賊作父的『肉傀儡』，齊來三覆斯言。</p>

<p>這位鄧祿普先生的本姓，並不是鄧，他的大名，也不是祿普。這鄧祿普三字，是同事們，公送給他的，原因是這位鄧祿普先生，有一種非常的習性，只須有着一點兒小便宜，雖然是吃人白眼，受人冷笑，他都是滿不在乎的。因此，大家都趕着呼之為鄧祿普，言其面皮之厚，不亞於鄧祿普汽車胎也。在他初成名時，他倒還對於這個雅號，有些兒扭扭捏捏，不怎麼敢承受，可是現在呢，他倒也安之若素了。</p>
<p>這位鄧祿普先生，是終年的空着香煙匣兒的，但是他在每天六七小時的辦公鐘點之內，至少總得吸掉十來支，他的香烟的惟一來源，是向同事們厚著臉索取，好在同事的有近二十位，除了不吸烟者之外，平均每日每人，供給他倒支，也就夠了。但若誰指着不給他時，他便會裝着一個鬼臉道，「鄧祿普碰得了古特異了」。因為古特異，也是車胎之一種，大家怕也有一種怪頭銜，所以終於了授一支給他，以了事端。有時，他無處可以設法時，便去向主任問長問短，問到後來，總是隨手在主任桌子上的香烟罐中，拈一支。近來，主任也知道他這一手法，所以見他上來時，總是先授給他一支，那末，脫了二三名，他便啣着香烟走了。</p>
<p>終年，他是不掏一個大錢，買點心的。若是別位同事，買了蟹売黃，生煎饅頭之類，他總是不會一個不到嘴的。去年起，我們組織了個月月聚餐會，每月聚餐一次。當時請鄧祿普加入，他搖着頭說，「沒有意思，不加入。」可是當我們聚餐時，他却倒是每次總是來做着不速之客。到後來，我們總是秘密得不給他知道日期與地點，但是有時，却還是會給他發現，而按時光降，有說有笑的大吃白食，盡醉方休。若是有人家裏過節，那麼，自然他是不會不到的。</p>
<p>最近，茶房阿二，也趕着他稱鄧祿普先生了，原因是曾給他嬲着去逛了二次遊戲場，喝了一次酒，臨了，他總是拍拍屁股滿口的道謝，瞧着阿二掏腰包會鈔。</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>美國加里福尼亞州巴洛瑪山嶺，現將建造視察台一所，所中所用的大望遠鏡一架，鏡面廣二百吋，驚費美金二百萬元，由這鏡中瞭望天空，遠度可較現在所有的望遠鏡增多一倍，可發見向來未猜想到的星和星雲，可使月球覺得距離地球更近，好像只隔二千五哩的光景。那鏡所用的玻璃毛坯，好像一大圓塊牛酷，重十噸，為把這玻璃磨成境面起見，專造了一架機器。那形式像一座唱片機，重五十噸，機上有一雙巨臂，好像唱片機上插鋼針的彎柄，那放針的地方，却鑲着鑄鐵的圓盤，直徑從四呎到九呎，和玻璃磨擦，那放唱片的地位，不用說，便是那塊大玻璃了。那機器自從本年五月起開轉，直到現在，幾未停息，大約還須　磨二十個月，才能完工，那機器放在一間有重幕遮住，陽光，灰塵不入，空氣清潔的光學化驗室內，有磨玻璃的精練工匠和大文學家照料這工作，要把那玻璃磨成拋物線的凹形面，中心比四邊約低四吋，那磨光的工作，極為精細，假使有一吋的一百萬分之一的缺點，也能察覺，立即消除，那機器每一分鍾轉一次，這似乎轉的很慢。其實這個計書在一九二八年即已開始，到了一九三四年十二月，才用一百零四大杓镕化的玻璃，在比太陽熱度及五分之一的熱度中澆成一大塊玻璃粗坯，整個的擱了一年，那熱度才漸漸地滅低而冷了，然後由專車由紐約州考林鎮運到巴薩特那鎮上，機器磨光，預料要到一九四〇年才能完工，成一座望遠鏡。磨光之時，要非常謹慎，不能有一絲斑點紋路，那塊大玻璃能夠豎起，察其有無斑紋，或是否平整，察驗的時候，須用極強的光，由一個管中射在鏡面上，假使那鏡面是絕平，那鏡便光明像一個滿月，假使鏡面有不平之點，便現出陰處，於是那一點便須再磨，在三年工作完畢之前，須磨去玻璃三噸以上，磨光所用的主要材料，是金鋼砂，和寶石漿，究竟要用多少砂漿雖專家也不能估計，磨光機器慢慢轉動的時候，其他準備已在逐步進行，現料在一九四〇年左右，那鏡便可使用，於是所能望見的天上星辰，可比現在遠一倍，或兩倍。現已在六千一百二十六呎的巴洛瑪山嶺購妥與造觀望台的地址，先須由山腳築路通至山嶺，以供運輸材料，並將建一飛行場，以容納加州工學院和其他團體的科學家，另將以美金一百萬元，建造房屋，安置已在加州工學院開造的輔助機械和一切儀器。那望遠鏡的架子，重八百五十噸，目下正在費城製造，其中有長五十五呎的格子金屬管，管中可坐一位使用那望遠鏡的科學家，好像鳥在籠裏一般，這一所氣象台將來洛成之後，可以窺見天空人所未見的星辰，估計共需經費美金六百萬至一千萬元之間，現已由各處煤油大王洛基斐勒基金處籌集得大半了。</p>

<p>第八回　杯水盟心青燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>那信共有一張信紙，婉轉的敘述着，都是說到送這枚戒指的事情。其中有一段話：</p>
<p>吾人始終為道義之交，則相贈物品，亦不妨認為朋友在道義上之醜贈，所以襯托精神，藉存紀念。正毋須以世俗之眼光視之，而有所顧忌也。</p>
<p>這寥寥幾十個字，把國器所寫想的情形，可以說是完全解脫。惟其如此，絕對是夢蘭的口氣，他出於本意，以金戒指相贈，是無疑的了。有了這封信，自是加了國器一晚的推敲，　覺得老撇不開這道義之交四個字，是一種煩悶。但夢蘭的真意何在，和他到底有什麼，又不知道，也不能說道義之交四字，不是他萬不得已說的。因之他表面上，決不否認這道義之交四個字。次日一早起來，把書架上一只小紫檀木盒子取下，打開來，裏面有許多心愛的小物品。最好是個長方的小錦盒，不過大拇指大。裏面是白絨墊着，有兩粒紅豆。錦盒上有塊玻璃，不必揭蓋，就可以看到。盒底上，蠅頭小楷，寫了一句古詩，此物最相思。他取到手上把玩了很久，也找了個洋式信封，把來和盒子盛著。然後用了一句詩經的典寫在上面，永以為好也。辦得妥帖了，另外寫了一封信，信封上寫明敬托轉交貴友明山先生。這明山兩個字，他也很費了一番斟酌的。他是用明山去暗射幽谷。由幽谷兩字，再牽涉到那個蘭字，這是只讓圍子裏的人可懂的意思。兩個信封全放在書案上，他心裏是很坦然了。這只希望傳書的李小姐到來了。靜坐了一會，看看窗外的日影，又把昨晚所接的信，仔細看了一遍，自言自語的道：這說的明白，他是今天上午來呀。不過自己又轉身一想，所謂上午，在十二點鍾以前，都包括在內，現在還不過十點鍾，當然還有一會。於是按下了性子，捧了一本書看看，再磨地一硯池墨，寫兩張大楷。這些全作過了，堂屋裏的鍾，便當然的敲過十二下。上午之約，　算已失，這位李小姐是不是能把他兩粒相思豆代送出去，就不可知了。（一〇五）</p>

<p>— 沈楨</p>
<p>明聖之美，不在湖而在溪，不在水而在山。吾嘗窮之矣，久而方得其始至也，繞湖一週，覩夫曉黛初融，春烟徐起，謂已盡之矣。既而登韜光，攀萬松，窺錢塘如帶，孤墺如螺，又以為盡之矣。遊既數，漸生厭，向以為美者，竊訝其庸。於是縱之四極，思窮其妙。而雲棲，九溪，烟霞，三竺，足跡漸遠，終無所得。一旦過理安，疎曠遼逈，蕭然有異致。初不經意，爽氣颯颯過，雙眸大豁，始拄杖尋繹之。覺空翠大來。眉光欲化，山鳥時啼，鳴琴在石，蓋幽而不凄，涵而不露，占地之和，而得靜中趣者。漸奇之，為留一日程以玩之。午雞無聲，僧課不作，疎陽來去，空山悄然，箕趣在畫。林木寫韻，山風過溪，倦羽振衣，微涼生袂，其趣在夕。宵鍾一聲，清磬徐動，香梵如雨，微聞澗波，其趣在枕。迨夫好鳥破晨，初陽漏枕，宿霧漸脫，亂青欲流，朝唄繞梁，昨夢無跡，得晨之趣，又異常時，快然自足，悵然出門，餘味在笏。彼其之勝，亦既如李更看碑，三復始知，猶恨不能布衣盤礴，作三日留也。驪珠乍得，奇興忽農。賈小舟，放鬆木　，緣溪道出。數十里無間。妙觀攸圓。綠嬋千頭，黃衫兩岸，橋之喧，橙之鬧也，霜林亂丹，野塍被紫，柿之攢，栗之簇也。再入十里，則厥勝盡蘆花。蓋西溪也。溪故以蘆花勝。環水十里，東西南北，亂流如蛛網，脈絡悉通，無溪不蘆，舟入其境，前後左右，宛轉廻環，引欋深波，迎首尾皆蘆花也。銀光披拂，作揖以迎，鞠躬而送，倚舟舷賞之四望積素流　，柔　可戀，髪眉咸白，襟塵盡銷。艤於秋雪菴，為西溪絕勝處，登樓日彈指，祀兩浙歷代詞人數百，位置樸雅，冷趣宜人，啟窗一望，萬蘆交映，瑞銀一片，榮成雪光，十里內無遁影。視一　變漿，廣狹又不同矣。有僧訊行路，烹溪水作茗，陳餅餌療飢，頗致殷勤，能信宿大是佳事，惜黃塵催夢，不耐少留為憾。出赴交蘆菴，地轉幽僻，樓中楹聯絕精，別搆妙諦，看蘆花亦能窮其狀。溪中尚有古祠一，祀樊榭，大宗。二賢故契友，其行落落，初不僅以詞童顯。祠壁刻大宗弔樊榭詩數律，其「東郭冷過挑菜節，南國悽斷采桑春」一聯，故會轟傳一時，詫為弔樊榭詩之厭卷者，想見二公道義之深，數百載下，摩挲手澤，不禁黯然生異感。折赴留下，登花塢，竹徑高深，蕭寥澄慮，唯聞履聲，遙雜竹喧，靜態轉肅。其嶺有閣，一嫗司茗，坐久忘倦，腹小飢，餐鹽水雞卵數枚而返。溪之勝可並理安，雖山水兩殊，而厥美無遜，吾是以知明聖之美，當求諸湖山之外也。</p>

<p>— 汶</p>
<p>記得在前二天，意國駐華大使還表示過：外傳意日之間，也將有一種協定之訂定，以日本承認意國併吞阿比西尼亞，意國承認偽滿為交換條件，聲明這傳說完全是「謠言」。但意日協定竟已實現了。使得意國大使只能忸怩的對記者說：「究竟有無此事，完全不知，殊無可以奉吿」云云。我多時以來，準備打起千足的勇氣，對墨索里尼與希特勒發生崇拜之心·但事實總難使我如頗。比如，看了希特勒「我的奮鬥」，說中國入是下等民族，自己想總不至於以奴扌的資格去侍奉高等民族中最高等的權威者為榮，這使崇拜希特勒的心一半寒了。此刻又接續發現了希特勒墨索里尼一手包辦下的德意兩國，正和侵略我們者打得火熱，敵人之友，不正是同樣是我之敵人嗎？人雖愚頑至於無可救藥，以自己的皮肉去喂虎狼總不會甘心罷。這使我要準備崇拜墨希兩位英雄的心又寒了一半。剩下來的心思，還是謹防門口，門外正是虎狼成羣，向我耽耽而視！</p>
<p>虎狼要走進你的門口，自然它身上披的决不是一件駭人的毛皮，而是化裝過了的。比如，我們「友邦」要在我國內宣布其「王道」，把「滿洲皇國」的恩惠，普遍地灑到中國每一個人民的頭上，若老實如此說，是未免駭人的。故代替的　號，是「親善」，「提携」，以及共同防什麽之類。說這是王道上國，為奠定東亞和平而安天下的大計，中國人不能不「澈底認識」。最近又在說了：「內蒙軍之在綏遠作戰，乃因中國共黨及與共產組織有密切關係之中國軍人團體壓迫日甚，故不得不以此而自衛。內蒙之目的，與日本及「滿洲國」緊急國策當脗合。日軍事當局盼望內蒙之成功，故對於足以妨害「滿洲國」之安寗與秩序，或使中國全土布爾希維克化之事變，不能漠不關心」云（偽滿與關東軍對綏東軍事共同發表之公吿）。照這公吿說來，其邏輯便是：凡是反偽滿者，皆是共黨；而現在與內蒙軍作戰之中國軍隊，皆為中國共黨或與共黨有密切關者：因此，全中國若皆反偽滿，則證明中國巳全土布爾希維克化；而要不中國全土布爾希維克化，反言之，卽中國全土必須「王道化；再反言之，反偽滿與布爾希維克化是一物的兩面，故欲不布爾希維克化，只有中國全　皆服從王道」，擁護日本帝國——這並非文學上的游戲，而確確實實「友邦」的意思是如此。</p>
<p>日意聯盟，又一决揭露了侵略主義者的眞面目。照上面那個中國「非此卽彼」的解釋，在日意德聯盟之下，中國的命運是：不為其狗，卽為其刀下之鬼——此外，無路可走！</p>
<p>果眞是無路可走？</p>

<p>— 朱明霞</p>
<p>風雨篇之一</p>
<p>在隱隱地望得見地平綫的時候，天開始夜了。西方微明的天空，黑雲忙亂的浮動，像突然起了紛亂的人羣，互相衢撞和擠軋。</p>
<p>執掌舵的船老大，堅定的把着舵柄，舟一直的向西南駛去。「今夜有暴風雨呢——」他想。</p>
<p>他凝視着天空，有經騐的眼睛，似乎看着實質的東西一樣的看淸楚風色。海相當平靜。</p>
<p>一隻海鷗，展開牠白色的雙翅，從船邊掠過，於是他眼前感到一瞥的明亮</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>。他看看滔滔的海水，測騐着船的速度：再看看忙亂的黑雲，估計着風的速度。他很有把握的决定船先到岸，然後風才襲來。</p>
<p>波浪似乎比方才更平了，風帆受着滿帆的順風，微凸的，像吃飽了東西的肚子，但是他覺得不滿意，放了舵，把掛帆的盤車轉了幾轉，於是，帆直透到桅頭，十分挺拔，船更快的駛去了。</p>
<p>幾個年靑的船夫，躺在船板上，快樂的談着關於女人的事情，有時候，更縱聲的笑着，船老大不肯打破他們的快樂的氛圍，忍着不把將要到來的事情吿訴他們。</p>
<p>天空全黑了，黑雲遮件了半張天，只有海的東頭，幾顆大星，使勁的閃爍着。——離開港口更近了。</p>
<p>海出奇的靜默，船的駛行的速度，突然慢下去。船老大把他的手伸出，—一點風屑也沒有。這是暴風雨將來時的沉默。他知道：今天和暴風雨競走的失敗。但是他還沒有作聲。黑雲吞盡了儘有的星星。</p>
<p>躺在船板上的年靑的船失們，也被大海的出奇的沉默所驚覺了。他們紛紛的站起來，分頭的檢點着船上的一切。一個人把一隻玻璃的船燈點着，於是這漆黑的海上，就有了唯一的光亮。</p>
<p>突然，像給一個不知道什麽的大東西的背負起來一樣，船高了。大海站立了，在昏黃的燈光中，無數巨浪，像崩石一般的向船倒下。</p>
<p>風像一個巨人在廻旋舞，挺起了滿帆的船，不停的前進和倒退。</p>
<p>就在這時候，雨像倒的一樣落下，打在穿着夾衣的肩背上，使人感到沉重</p>
<p>船老大站立了把着舵。他想突破這暴風雨的包圍，　是不能，船只是向後退去。</p>
<p>「把帆落下來！」於是他不能不發這樣的命令。迎面吹來的風太大，忙着別件事的船夫，一個也沒有聽到。</p>
<p>船退得更快了，「把帆落下來，把帆落下來啊！」他不得不竭力的喊着，但是還是沒有用，風更大，雨也更大，船燈給雨的簾幕所包圍，他站在船尾上，感到天更暗了。</p>
<p>船一直向後退去，卽使在黑暗中，船老大還是很淸楚的知道快要退到有暗礁的地方了。於是他堅决的放了舵，順手拿了一把切菜刀，奔到桅下，拚命斫着帆繩。</p>
<p>繩斷了，帆很快的落下來，但落到中問，又停住了。一根繩，絆住在滑車裏。立刻一個人獲猴似的爬上去。</p>
<p>舵沒有把定，船就失了控制，風在旋轉，船也在旋轉。船板上的雨積得太多，船夫們奔走時，冲冲的向四方濺起。突然，堅着的帆，和爬上去的人，一同落下了。</p>
<p>暴風雨更高興的發着威，船左右傾斜着。船夫們大家知道這時候已經不能控制船身的均衡了，索興坐着不動了。</p>
<p>突然，船老大大聲的喊起來，另一隻船就在左近。一點燈光，從雨中的略可以看到。伸出船尾的篙子，已經碰到另一隻船的船身了。假使再倒，兩隻船就立刻因相碰而粉碎。</p>
<p>於是兩條船上所有的船夫，全體出動，拚命的用篙子互相點着，使他們中間隔着相當的距離。</p>
<p>距離至多五六尺，而每一個人的呌喊，別人聽去，總像在半里以外。他們爲了要對方的聽淸楚，每一個字都拖得很長，然而，尾聲總給暴風雨吞沒了。</p>
<p>鬥爭繼續了二小時，暴風雨終於過去。於是，所有的人，都從死亡綫上逃出，而長長的吁着氣。</p>
<p>雨還是耐心的下着，兩隻船，接聯的向着一個熟悉的港口駛進。船燈照着船板上的積水，非常光亮。</p>
<p>小港旁邊的人家，有人從夜半醒來，在潺緩的雨聲中，聽到幾個船夫的快樂的喊聲。</p>
<p>啊……嗨！……啊……嗨！……</p>

<p>幅仙裙留燕燕。幾聲雅奏和鶯鶯。正不知，何處吹蕭弄玉笙。此曲原非天上有。都說道，美人歌舞善調箏。試看那，翩翩宛若驚鴻影。輕似凌空飛燕身。好比是，蔡女文姬十八拍。好比是，湘靈鼓瑟響錚錚。好比是，琵琶一曲昭君怨。好比是，紅綫多才盜盒輕。且看他，素絹剪裁衣袖薄。凌波羅襖凈無　。一雙玉臂隨風舞。喜學摩登體態輕。都爲是，無賴狡童輕薄樣。綠珠防作墮樓人。只恐怕，楊枝柔弱嬌無力。故而，一樓紅絲繫足繩。有時節，風狂顚倒空翻影。戲作楊妃出浴身。不是廬山眞面目。天涯何處覓知音。倘然是，一朝墮落風塵裏。惹起了，多少傍觀冷眼人。所以是，立定脚根無失足。得收蓬處且留停。紙糊老虎休截破。還防得，驟雨在風朝夕臨。却原來，麋世寄生同是夢。連風飄泊等浮雲。無非一樣共升沉。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sui East and Sui North: Bandit-Puppet Troops Increase Defenses Separately; A Large Number of Puppet Troops Arrive in Shangdu; Counter-Offensive Plan Already Decided; Will Invade in Two Routes Within Days <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Guihua) The puppet Manchukuo army has reinforced Suidong Shangdu and Suibei Damiaozi areas with a total of 5,000 troops, with 3,000 in Damiaozi. They plan to use Damiaozi as a base to attack Bailingmiao, but our army is prepared and the bandits will never succeed. Suidong is currently peaceful. The puppet Manchukuo army is concentrated in Shangdu, not daring to come out, fearing our army's attack, and appear extremely frightened. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Shangdu news on the evening of the 1st. More than ten people, including a certain counselor of the puppet Mengjiang government and Mongolian traitors, went to the West Sonid Banner on November 23 to see De Wang's illness. They returned to Jiabusite on the 29th. That night, the commander of a certain special affairs agency, and Mongolian traitors, held an emergency meeting. The most important issue was the plan to invade Sui, and the deployment of rear troops, etc. The main decisions were: 1. Send troops to counter-attack Bailingmiao, undertaken by the puppet 2nd and 5th Divisions currently stationed in Shangdu, the Mongolian Security Team, and the Rehe army Wang Jingxiu's troops. 2. Counter-attack Honggeertu, undertaken by bandit troops stationed in Xibei Tuntian Tuolawusu and other villages, and Shangdu bandit troops. 3. Actively invade Xinghe, undertaken by the puppet 1st, 3rd, and 6th Divisions stationed in Nanhaogian, and Zhang Wanqing's two brigades. 4. A certain side's military group will form a supervisory team, with a certain person from the puppet Jing'an Army as the team leader, and orders were given that anyone who retreats will be executed. 5. People from a certain side will accompany and command the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd routes, using chemical warfare weapons and directing the attack. 6. Distribute weapons to each route: 1. Issue 15 tanks and 20 airplanes. 2. Issue 10 airplanes, and a total of 12 tanks and armored vehicles. 3. Details unknown. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: Several thousand puppet Rehe troops arrived in Shangdu on the 30th, together with the puppet Li Shou-hsin and Wang Ying's troops, gathering a total of more than 9,000 infantry and cavalry. Many military officers from a certain country have also arrived from Changchun, directing the defense works. All large and small civilian houses in the city have been occupied by the puppet army. Wang Ying's commando team of more than 3,000 is running rampant between Wuchuan and Taolin Heishanzi, intending to divert our forces. In addition, there are bandit plainclothes teams, lurking on the Ping-Sui Railway, wanting to sabotage transportation. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 3,000 puppet troops led by Rehe Zhang Hai-peng, led by a military officer from a certain side, have concentrated in Pangjiang. More than 2,000 troops of the puppet Yu Zhishan's department, carrying heavy weapons, have also moved from Liaoningxi. A part of the puppet troops arrived at Daqinggou on the border of Chahar and Sui on the 30th. It is said that the puppet bandits have decided to invade Sui in two routes within days, one route attacking Bailingmiao from Pangjiang, and the other route disturbing Lintao Xinghe from Daqinggou. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: In recent days, those who have aspirations from the bandit departments of Li Shou-hsin, Wang Ying, Bao Yue-qing, etc., in Suidong, have gathered in groups of five or six with guns and weapons, and come to Jining to surrender. Our authorities have now specially formulated methods for accepting and appeasing them. In addition to rewards according to regulations, if they want to continue military life, they will be sent to the rear for training. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei news: Many troops from a certain side have arrived in the six counties of Zhangbei, occupying civilian houses and driving out residents. In recent days, refugees fleeing from Zhangyuan are constantly arriving. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is heard that the Mongolian army that was defeated at Bailingmiao is now reorganizing its army in Damiao, 40 miles east, in order to recover the lost land. The National Army has consolidated its defense line and is preparing to meet the enemy. The military conference held in Guihua in recent days concluded last night. The commanders of each army immediately returned to their defensive positions. Chen Cheng is now inspecting Pingdiquan, and then will go to Taiyuan to meet with Yan Xishan. According to a Chinese newspaper, the enemy has reinforcements arriving, 2,000 Mongolian cavalry from Rehe, and 3,000 Manchu soldiers commanded by Zhang Hai-peng have arrived in Shangdu. There are also 3,000 "Manchu" mixed troops, carrying artillery, who have arrived in Jiabusite. A large amount of grain has been transported to Duolun and into Chahar, because Inner Mongolia is very barren and cannot supply the large army currently fighting in Chahar Province and northern Sui. The saying that De Wang intends to surrender to the central government has not yet been verified. Many believe that even if De Wang has this intention, he cannot do it, because his trusted army is less than 2,000, and it is difficult to compete with the remaining attacking armies. He is currently pretending to be sick and living in his banner, unwilling to return to Jiabusite. (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei news: In the past two weeks, more than 10,000 puppet troops have arrived in northern Chahar from Rehe via Duolun Weichang, and have been separately assigned to increase defenses.

The telegram arrived in Nanjing on the 1st. The original text reads: "We, the Chinese nation, are composed of Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan. The differences in families within a country are like the different names of people in a place. We depend on each other in times of difficulty, and share weal and woe. The relationship is as close as brothers. Looking around the world, imperialists are eyeing us covetously, swallowing and seizing openly and secretly, disregarding justice and humanity. Looking at the domestic situation, unification is just beginning, and everything needs to be revitalized. It is only through the sincere unity of the entire Chinese nation that we can become strong. Our central government has followed the wishes of the Mongolians and allowed the expectation of regional autonomy in Sui and Mongolia. The establishment of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee in the Sui border is also for this purpose. Mongolians are a part of the Chinese nation, sharing the same fate. Its rapid rise depends on the struggle under the leadership of the central government and the cooperation of local authorities, in order to win the independence and liberation of the entire Chinese nation. We hereby express our sincerity and humbly request your consideration. The Chairman of the Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee in the Sui border, Shakdurjab, the Vice-Chairmen Babodordzi, Altan Ochir, and Pande Gongchab, and all committee members and staff kowtow and submit this document."

<h3 id="e62">Tokyo Correspondence: Japanese Political Parties Amidst the Calls for Parliamentary Reform (Part 2) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>Therefore, the parliamentary reform proposal put forward by the military is not only a demonstration against the political parties, but also very meaningful in strengthening the power of the Japanese ruling class. The recent reform of administrative organs has fully expressed a tendency toward integration in its political nature. If the parliamentary system is not reformed and the powers of the parliament are not reduced, the political parties representing the interests of the majority of the people may have the possibility of forming a cabinet. Wouldn't that make it difficult for the ruling class? In this regard, the parliamentary reform proposal, as well as the denial of parliamentary politics, in fact, cannot form a conflict among the Japanese ruling classes, but rather exposes the ideological opposition in Japanese society, which is becoming increasingly acute. It is less of an attack on existing political parties than a prevention of future political parties. Preventing the progress of the People's Front movement and the emergence of leftist political parties is naturally very necessary for the current Japanese ruling class. Therefore, although both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are now advocating for the protection of the constitution, the outcome is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>In addition to the two major political parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, it is also necessary to mention the attitudes of the Social Democratic Party and the "National Alliance." The "National Alliance" itself has already clearly become fascist, so there is no conflict with the military. On November 7, the president of the party, Mr. Adachi, issued a statement, the gist of which was: "The recent calls for parliamentary reform have caused anxiety and embarrassment among the political parties. The political parties cannot but exercise self-restraint and self-reflection in the face of this situation. First, today's political parties no longer have the national policy and enthusiasm to guide the country. Second, in the past few years, the political parties have all adopted an attitude of following the government. Third, party members of political parties inevitably engage in corrupt behavior." In addition, Mr. Adachi also criticized the current cabinet's diplomacy toward China, expressing much indignation. From this, it can also be seen that he is speaking with one voice as the military.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party is, in name, supposed to represent the working masses. It should be standing on the front line, using the power of the political party to fight the military. However, the Social Democratic Party can no longer shoulder this mission. The fascist coloring of the Social Democratic Party's cadres has become very strong. Some time ago, when the military prohibited employees of army factories from joining trade unions, the Social Democratic Party also clamored for a struggle at the time, but in the end, it disappeared without a trace. Even if this time it is about the life and death of political parties - especially the party of the working masses - the Social Democratic Party cadres will certainly not perform the duties of struggle.</p>
<p>The power of struggle will unfold in other aspects and will promote the division of various political parties as a result of this incident. Ideological opposition will form two distinct battle lines.</p>
<p>On November 5, the young and middle-aged factions of the Minseito Party, dissatisfied with the weak attitude of the party's leadership, organized the "Minseito Constitutional Protection Diet Members Association" and began active action, deciding to lash out at the party's leadership and cabinet members from the party, implementing the following resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) Promote the original meaning of constitutional politics and eliminate fascist ideas.</p>
<p>(2) Repel serving military personnel from interfering in politics.</p>
<p>(3) Give full play to the functions and powers of the parliament and enhance the role of political parties.</p>
<p>At the same time, some members of the Seiyukai Party also organized an extra-parliamentary group to launch a constitutional protection movement, echoing the young and middle-aged factions of the Minseito Party. At 6 PM on the 10th, the two parties' extra-parliamentary groups had already held a joint informal meeting at the Shinybashi Toyoken, resolving to jointly launch a major constitutional protection movement and passing the following proposals:</p>
<p>(1) Absolutely oppose any attempt to reduce the powers of the parliament or deny political parties.</p>
<p>(2) Oppose serving military personnel interfering in politics.</p>
<p>(3) Repel the conspiracy of bureaucrats to overstep their authority.</p>
<p>(4) Whip the cadres of political parties, awaken them in unison, and support constitutional government.</p>
<p>In contrast, at 3 PM on the 11th, the leadership of the Minseito Party also convened a cadre meeting at the party headquarters. It was resolved to investigate the truth of the so-called parliamentary reform proposal, hoping that the young and middle-aged factions would be self-respecting and not act rashly. What kind of effect the leadership's actions will have remains to be seen in later facts. But in any case, it cannot but be said that this is a sign of the party's split.</p>
<p>In addition, what is echoing in conjunction with this is the recent election of ward councilors in Japan. Among the candidates in the places where the results have already been announced, the proletarian faction occupies a very clear advantage. This and the current parliamentary issue will directly and indirectly have an impact in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, let's end this article with a few sentences from today's "Problems of the Day" in the Asahi Shimbun.</p>
<p>"Inside the parliament building, a grand and solemn completion ceremony is being held. Outside the parliament building? The national masses are feeling anxiety and suffering under the heavy pressure of extraordinary times."</p>
<h3 id="e63">British Strategies for Negotiation (Part 1) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Authored by Walter Scobell of England, Translated by Yu Erchang</p>
<p>It is a commonly acknowledged fact that the British Empire has reached a critical juncture. Our (the author's self-reference, same below) government is well aware of this situation. But what exactly are the people in the government thinking? How will they deal with the current crisis? Are they still indecisive, or do they have a proactive policy? What kind of strategy will they decide on? It is worthwhile work to consider these questions and gain some insight.</p>
<p>I would like to point out first that behind the British government, there are several basic principles that guide all its actions. The British ruling class is in agreement on these principles; it is only in the application of these principles that they may sometimes have differences of opinion. Secondly, our rulers are very sensitive, and they can quickly see the surrounding trends and changes, and seek to adapt rapidly. Therefore, the current world situation is also something we must pay close attention to. The world situation is constantly changing, and our government is adapting to these changing circumstances, using its principles to determine its diplomatic strategy. If we want to know the role that Britain plays in these long-term turbulent international relations, and the path that the British government will choose in the face of this difficult situation, we must first ask:</p>
<p>(1) What are the fixed and unchanging fundamental principles behind the British ruling class?</p>
<p>(2) What are the emerging and growing forces that are constantly changing the world?</p>
<p>Now, let's write out the answer to the first question. Since the rise of capitalism, the main principles that have governed British diplomacy are:</p>
<p>(1) Mastery of maritime hegemony.</p>
<p>(2) Maintaining maritime war bases and fuel stations.</p>
<p>(3) Maintaining the balance of power between nations.</p>
<p>The above three traditional principles are still firmly held today. There is an inseparable relationship between them. The edifice of the British Empire is entirely supported by them. In addition, there is also free trade and "open door", but it has been abolished since the end of the Great War.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the twentieth century, due to the demands of the times, two new principles have emerged:</p>
<p>(4) The first principle, for lack of a better name, let's call it "Need for Support". The opening of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902 was the first application of this principle. The establishment of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was a self-inflicted blow to Britain's prestige, as it implied that Britain no longer had the power to maintain maritime hegemony alone. However, this did not indicate that Britain had abandoned maritime hegemony, but merely a modification of principle (1). As mentioned earlier, our ruling class is good at adapting to the surrounding circumstances. Many of the obvious disadvantages of this alliance, the greatest of which was the loss of prestige of the British Empire, had already been foreseen by our government when it was signed in 1902. However, the alliance was established, and later extended, why? Firstly, Japan was an emerging maritime power, and far away in East Asia, which was not easily reached by the British Empire's naval power. This situation was clearly seen by our far-sighted politicians even before the decisive victory of the Russo-Japanese War. Secondly, before 1914, such a modification was necessary in order to prepare for war and avoid excessive consumption of national power. However, this modification ultimately proved the wavering of the British Empire's confidence, and its urgent need for assistance in Asia. An isolated maritime hegemony was ultimately beyond the power of the empire. This was painful for our ruling class, and it also scattered many thorns on the road of British diplomacy.</p>
<p>(5) The second new principle is "Defense of Capitalism". This principle further includes the universal patronage of all reactionary forces – no matter where they appear or in what form – and the uniform hostility towards any progressive forces – whether political or economic democracy, autonomy, colonial liberation movements, internationalism, educational development, or socialism. This is actually a modification and supplement to principle (3) – maintaining the balance of power. In the nineteenth century, the face of British imperialism was indeed fierce, but it still had some semblance of liberalism. At that time, it was unusually confident, so it was not hasty. But the situation was changing drastically. The development of capitalism itself, and the rise of American capitalism, caused it to suddenly lose its inherent position, thus shaking its consistent confidence. And the success of socialism in the Soviet Union made it appear in a desperate state of jumping over the wall. Therefore, our wise rulers raised the banner of "protecting capitalism", to reconcile with the externally strong but internally weak fascist countries, believing that this would restore the balance of power in the international community and preserve their own position.</p>
<p>We now want to see what the current world situation is like. For the sake of clarity, let's list them below along with the basic principles:</p>
<p>Basic Principles:</p>
<p>(1) Mastery of maritime hegemony.</p>
<p>(2) Maintaining maritime war bases and fuel stations.</p>
<p>(3) Maintaining the balance of power between nations.</p>
<p>(4) Obtaining assistance.</p>
<p>(5) Protecting capitalism.</p>
<p>World Situation:</p>
<p>(6) The growth of American imperialism.</p>
<p>(7) The influence of communism in France and Spain.</p>
<p>(8) Japan's offensive in industry.</p>
<p>(9) Japan's offensive in armaments.</p>
<p>(10) Germany's return to the world political stage.</p>
<p>(11) The emergence of air power.</p>
<p>(12) The rise of nationalism.</p>
<p>(13) The awakening of the colonies.</p>
<p>(14) The League of Nations system and the concept of collective security.</p>
<p>(15) The success of socialism in the Soviet Union and its internationalization.</p>
<p>Among the various factors that influence the overall situation of the world, we can see that five are local, or limited by national boundaries; and five are general, or international in nature (relatively speaking, of course). For the sake of brevity, I have not included in the table various factors that do not currently occupy an important position. For example, Italy's dream of building an "East African Empire" is obviously a major threat to us. But our foreign ministry's estimates are very practical. The years 1915 to 1918 exposed Italy as a country with more debts than assets, and our diplomats do not believe that fascism can make Italy rejuvenate. Therefore, the current threat of Italy may not have been put on their minds. However, the development of the German air force and its hostile attitude in the Mediterranean should not be ignored. This will be brought out later when we pay attention to the application of principle (5) – protecting capitalism.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Opening of the Pan-American Peace Conference <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The Pan-American Peace Conference opened yesterday in the capital of Argentina. At a time when aggressors around the world are united in attacking the god of peace, it is a welcome development that the twenty-one countries of the Americas can come together in the halls of peace to discuss the organization of peace in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>This Pan-American Peace Conference was initiated and convened by US President Roosevelt at the end of January this year. Therefore, at the opening ceremony, this re-elected "master of the White House" did not hesitate to travel there in person to attend. Why did President Roosevelt convene this peace conference and attach so much importance to it? Simply put, the convocation of this conference lies in promoting the United States' Good Neighbor Policy and selling commercial reciprocity agreements. We know that the United States' policy towards Latin America was previously to adhere to the narrow definition of the Monroe Doctrine. The strict implementation of this aggressive Monroe Doctrine only aroused anti-American sentiment in the small countries. Therefore, by the time of President Roosevelt, this "big stick diplomacy" was abandoned and a gentle Good Neighbor Policy was adopted instead. Behind this Good Neighbor Policy, there is naturally a demand for the outward development of financial power. This can be seen by looking at Secretary of State Hull's visit to South America with commercial reciprocity agreements for sale.</p>
<p>Regardless of the underlying motives of the United States in convening this peace conference, if we look at the peace conference itself, it is of great help to the promotion of the international peace movement. Because the main issue discussed at this conference is how to promote the peace organization of the Americas. In the past, the United States had signed four kinds of peace treaties, but none of them had the participation of a large number of countries, so their power was not great. At this conference, representatives of various countries will certainly further discuss how to enhance the power of these peace treaties. It may even go further and organize a League of Nations for the Americas. This kind of peaceful effort will naturally help promote the entire international peace.</p>
<p>Many people believe that the opening of the Pan-American Peace Conference will take an adversarial stance against the League of Nations in Geneva. In fact, this is not very accurate. Because Roosevelt's foreign policy contains a very strong tendency towards international cooperation. The history of the past four years is a good example. On the contrary, the further cooperation of the countries of the Americas can make the United States' relationship with Geneva closer through the wooing of the small countries of South America. Moreover, the regional security system is actually the beginning of the entire collective security system. Therefore, the Pan-American Peace Conference is of great significance to the promotion of the international peace movement.</p>
<p>The cooperation of the countries of the Americas not only has a great impact on international peace, but also has a significant relationship to the development of the situation in the Far East. We know that President Roosevelt has been vigorously implementing a policy of giant ships and big guns in recent years. Behind this policy of giant ships and big guns is the development of the situation in the Western Pacific. But before implementing countermeasures against the aggressors in the Far East, the relations between the countries of the Americas must first be adjusted. And the convocation of this Pan-American Conference actually contains this important significance of uniting the internal affairs.</p>

<p>Madrid: The Nationalist forces launched a fierce offensive this morning, seemingly determined to break through the capital's defenses. Intense fighting is currently underway on the Madrid front, with the intensity of artillery fire unprecedented in a month. (1st Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) This agency has just received a cable from Spain confirming the news carried in the News Chronicle, stating that 5,000 Germans were spotted landing at ports held by the Spanish Nationalist forces. Whether these individuals are German soldiers, whether they are carrying weapons, or whether they are wearing uniforms has not yet been determined. Officials here have stated that if these Germans are indeed carrying weapons or are German soldiers, the British government will undoubtedly express its regret if this is proven to be true. While individual enlistment in the Spanish army may not violate the non-intervention agreement, soldiers enlisting in another country requires the permission of their home government, which would be a blatant violation of the non-intervention agreement.

<p>(London) At the request of the Spanish government, the Council of the League of Nations has decided to hold a meeting in Geneva on the 10th of this month. The British chief representative will be Foreign Secretary Eden himself. This morning, sources claimed that the British government has received reports from various sources that between 2,000 and 7,000 Germans have recently arrived in the Seville area. If these Germans are a military organization or carrying weapons, the British government will express its deep regret. However, reports received indicate that they appear to be German volunteers. British concerns about the Spanish Civil War have increased considerably. However, one thing that Britain is also paying attention to is that a large number of German volunteers are also entering Spain from time to time. (1st Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, various circles here are extremely apprehensive about Spain's request for the Council of the League of Nations to convene a special meeting. The absence of Germany and Italy will make any public discussion a one-sided action without any practical effect. It is feared that the actions of the Council will not be superior to the work of the Non-Intervention Committee. Many believe that Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo may rely on the assistance of the Soviet government to propose blockading the ports held by the Nationalist forces and cutting off their supplies. However, any suggestion will be ignored by the public. (1st Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the British government has notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations that it would be futile for the Council to hold a meeting now to discuss the situation in Spain. This statement was explicitly denied by officials. Foreign Secretary Eden had talks with French Ambassador Corbin and Chilean Ambassador Edwards (the chairman of the current session of the Council) to discuss the convening of the Council meeting. Political circles believe that Germany and Italy will refuse to participate, so the Council meeting will not be of any significance. After the meeting of the Council, it will be declared that the Spanish Civil War must be limited in scope to prevent its expansion, and that the principle of "limiting the scope" can be implemented by the Adjustment Committee of the Non-Intervention Method.

<h3 id="e68">US-French War Debt Settlement Agreed Upon <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today that France owes a total of 1,200,000,000,000 francs in war debts to the United States. According to the payment method now agreed upon, 600,000,000,000 francs will be paid annually, to be paid off in twenty years. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is said today by authoritative sources here that the United States and France have decided to clear up the entire war debt issue. The United States Ambassador to France, Bullitt, met with French Foreign Minister Delbos for a long time, and a principle agreement was reached. Details will be discussed later. It is likely that the United States and France will agree that the war debts owed by France will be re-evaluated and then paid off in installments within twenty years. However, the British war debts must also be resolved at the same time, so that it can be used as a result of the three-nation monetary agreement, and can be regarded as a sign of respect for the treaty. French Prime Minister Blum has notified Bullitt that France is prepared to negotiate quickly and does not intend to argue much, and does not intend to make any demands on the United States. However, this measure is limited to the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States, and has nothing to do with other debtor countries such as Italy. According to estimates, France currently owes the United States a total of 400 million US dollars in principal and interest, and Britain owes even more than this amount. The last time France made a payment was in 1931, and Britain in 1933, but they have paid a small amount since then to show their commitment. France also hopes that the war debt agreement can be integrated with other political and economic agreements, so that world peace can be consolidated and international trade restored by abolishing import quotas and reducing rates. Since Britain's debts are greater than France's, France will also handle the settlement with Britain after the settlement. The United States and France will first discuss the total amount of debt and then discuss the payment method. Prime Minister Blum may personally go to Washington to discuss this matter, but the United States must first acknowledge that France has not defaulted. As for the total amount of debt in the future, it will be lower than before the default, but it will not be merely a token payment. According to the original agreement, France has defaulted on 21.5 million US dollars, and the total amount of principal and interest will reach 650 million US dollars by 1987. Here, the talks between the United States and France are still being kept strictly confidential today, and even the Foreign Ministry denies that the US Ambassador has met with the French Foreign Minister.

<p>Capital of Hungary: Regent Admiral Horthy has just returned home today after visiting Italy and Austria. Informed sources claimed that Interior Minister De Kanya has accepted the invitation of German Interior Minister Frick and is scheduled to go to Berlin on the 9th of this month for a five-day stay. In addition, other important people will also go to Germany. Political circles believe that since Germany expressed its indifference to Hungary's proposal to revise the Treaty of Trianon, the friendly relations between Germany and Hungary have been diminished. The German authorities' invitation to Hungarian dignitaries to visit Berlin this time is to restore friendly relations between the two sides. In addition, Interior Minister De Kanya fought under the command of the famous German General Mackensen during the European War, and he has extensive contacts in Germany. If he goes to Berlin this time to discuss countermeasures against communism with the German authorities, it will be a great boon. (1st Havas)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Ambassador to Rome Sugimura and Foreign Minister Ciano have reached a complete agreement. The Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Italian government have decided to release the following content simultaneously in Tokyo and Rome at dusk on the 2nd: (1) Confirm Japan's vested rights in trade in Abyssinia. (2) Abolish the Japanese legation stationed in Addis Ababa, notify the establishment of a new consulate, and the Italian government's approval. (3) The Italian government notifies the establishment of a new consulate general in Fengtian and its approval. In addition, when announcing the content, the Foreign Ministry also issued a statement from the authorities in order to dispel misunderstandings about the negotiations and clarify Japan's true intentions. (1st Domei)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The exchange of documents between Italy and Japan has been delayed for three days. Japan requires a firm guarantee to protect Japan's economic interests in Abyssinia. However, since the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the final instructions on the 30th, the entire negotiation is expected to end today. Japan's exports to Abyssinia amount to 20 million yuan, so Japan insists that Italy should guarantee preferential tariff treatment to Japan and protect the future market. At present, the relationship between Japan and Italy seems to be very different from the relationship between Japan and Germany. (1st Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Italian-Japanese agreement, political circles here are trying to reduce its importance, saying that the various malicious speculations about the agreement are mostly due to the current anti-communist propaganda and cannot be trusted. In fact, this agreement is purely economic in nature and does not contain any other meaning. (30th Havas)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to the "Manchukuo" Foreign Ministry, Italian Ambassador to Japan Auriti sent a note to "Manchukuo" Ambassador to Japan Xie Jieshi on November 20, stating that regarding the establishment of a consulate general in Shenyang, according to the instructions of the Italian government, he hoped to obtain "the recognition of the Manchukuo government" and requested his mediation. Therefore, the "Manchukuo" government decided to recognize the establishment of an Italian consulate general in Shenyang, and ordered Xie Jieshi to formally reply to Ambassador Auriti on December 1.

As for Britain's attitude towards the pact, the House of Commons should know that the government has clearly opposed any tendency to divide the world into several blocs, especially not for ideological reasons. The Foreign Secretary concluded that Britain's policy is still based on promoting friendship between countries. (1st Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Li Ziziluosi Again Delivers a Speech: Developing Sino-British Trade; My Income Tax Collection Should Be Fair; Foreign Nationals Should Voluntarily Pay <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(London) Sir Richard Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, delivered a speech at the China Association's annual banquet tonight, detailing China's economic situation and Sino-British trade relations. The annual banquet was chaired by Conservative Member of Parliament Lord Winterton, and the attendance was unprecedented in recent years. Important guests included Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Koupbert Lieck, the new resident representative of the Export Credits Guarantee Department in China, Conservative Member of Parliament Mallin, former Ambassador to China Sir Cadogan, Barclays Bank Vice-Chairman and Export Credits Guarantee Department Executive Committee Member Sir Caulcutt, Lord Cantelupe, a member of the House of Lords, and Lord Yarnis, General Manager of the General Insurance Company. In his speech, Li first described the smooth implementation of China's new currency system and recalled that China had paper money circulating throughout the country as early as the Yuan Dynasty. Regarding the Chinese government's proposed income tax, Li believed that the government must first provide a fair and perfect guarantee for the collection of the tax, and then foreign nationals in China could comply. However, British merchants should not insist on giving up the tax exemptions they originally enjoyed and must consider China's financial needs in a constructive spirit. Li reiterated that due to the current increase in trade and indirect tax revenue, recovery would be achieved sooner if tariffs could be modified. China's development is now extremely rapid, and the Chinese government should prioritize essential plans and implement them first, deferring less critical matters to a later date. Li also advocated that the Chinese government should make full use of foreign advisors, hoping that the foreign staff of the Salt Inspectorate would not be reduced, and that more foreigners should be hired in other government agencies. For example, if the assessment and collection of income tax were entrusted to foreign personnel, foreign nationals would be more willing to accept it. Regarding the grandeur of China's railway construction plans and the development of various public utilities, the United Kingdom should provide the necessary equipment at any time. He deeply understood that British industry, commerce, and banking circles could have close cooperation and hoped that there would also be the closest cooperation with China, agreeing to the greatest financial support for various large-scale projects. The British should also prepare to assist China in reorganizing various undertakings that are beneficial to both China and the United Kingdom. Li also stated that British industrialists should send younger and more capable personnel to China to seek further development of their businesses. Li concluded, "In the next ten years, the main task of the British in China will be to supply China with railways, electrical machinery, and other large-scale machinery needed for modern life. Therefore, the British people should have a broad vision for the ever-changing situation in the vast region of the Far East." (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) Austrian Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg met with Hungarian Prime Minister Dr. Darányi and Foreign Minister Kánya today and stated that Austria refused to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. Darányi proposed that Austria and Hungary jointly join the anti-communist group, to which Schuschnigg replied in this way, citing two reasons: (1) Austria learned that the German-Japanese pact was viewed by Western Europe as unhelpful to peace, so Austria did not want to provoke negative feelings from Britain and France towards Austria. (2) There is no real danger of communism in Austria. The Austrian government feels that the loyalty and assistance of the country's military and police are sufficient to deal with any attempts to disrupt peace. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Japanese Army Pamphlet Admits Japanese Army Is Not a Match for Russia; Insufficient Troops, Striving for Remediation; Air Force Dominates Future Wars <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry recently published a pamphlet, the contents of which are quite important. It is briefly described as follows: Although the Japanese military's strength is extremely superior in spirit and essence, it pales in comparison to the Soviet Far Eastern Red Army in terms of numbers. From a military strategic standpoint, the most dangerous fact is that the Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo" are too few. In any case, the Japanese army must maintain a similar balance with the Soviet Union's peacetime troops stationed in the Far East. One chapter in the pamphlet discusses the minimum limits of national defense strength, stating that, in view of the military strength of the Soviet Union and China, it can be seen that Japan's military preparations on the mainland are extremely incomplete. In order to avoid war and maintain Japan's lifeline on the mainland, the reorganization of military preparations is an urgent matter. The military strength required by a country must be determined by its peacetime policies, the country's current situation, and its relationship with other countries. If the military strength that the Soviet Union can place on the battlefield is as strong as various countries speculate, then Japan's current military strength, no matter how well-trained, strategically superior, or disciplined, will not be able to compensate for its insufficient numbers. It must be noted that mechanical and scientific equipment will become increasingly important in future wars. The Soviet Far Eastern military force consists of a total of fifteen divisions in peacetime, with 1,000 aircraft divided into more than 100 teams, and about 1,000 tanks. In addition, the Soviet Union has built extremely strong fortresses in the border areas, posing a constant threat of aggression to neighboring "Manchukuo." Looking back at Japan's military strength in Manchuria, what is it like? In terms of numbers, it is only one-third or one-quarter of that of the Soviet Union. As for aircraft and tanks, it is even far from comparable to the Soviet Union. Japan relies on this weak military force to patrol a meandering 3,000-mile border, maintain peace and order in an area equal to the territory of Germany and France, and guard a railway line exceeding 6,000 miles in length. The Soviet troops stationed along the Russo-Manchurian border are a strategic district garrison, while the scattered distribution of the Japanese army is a phenomenon of insufficient allocation. In short, the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria and Korea must have sufficient strength to guard the border, maintain public order, and patrol the railway line in peacetime. In wartime, they must also resist enemy invasion. It must be known that the outcome of the initial battles along the border will have a serious impact on the entire war situation. In order to consolidate border defenses, the Russo-Manchurian border troops must have sufficient defense capabilities. In order to consolidate the defense of the Asian continent and to ensure that the first line has complete protection in the event of a war with the Soviet Union, it is necessary for the Japanese garrison to increase proportionally to the Soviet military strength.</p>
<p>In a possible future war, large enemy aircraft will attempt to carry out air raids on Tokyo and Japan's major military and munitions bases immediately after the outbreak of the war. If Japan lacks the ability to carry out these air raids at the beginning, it will inevitably end in a tragic defeat. Therefore, in addition to the army, Japan's air force must also be actively expanded.</p>
<p>The importance of the air force in modern warfare is obvious and does not need to be elaborated. However, it is also a major element in preventing war. The British naval power is far above that of Italy, but its Mediterranean fleet does not dare to deal with the Italian fleet by extreme means because Italy's air force exceeds that of Britain. From this point of view, the replenishment of the Japanese air force is indeed an urgent matter.</p>
<p>Finally, it also mentions the need to revitalize national administration, saying that if domestic administration is on the right track, Japan will be able to compete with the Soviet Union in military preparations. The pamphlet contains many photos of Soviet aircraft, parachutes, and tanks, and includes a map detailing important military districts in the Far East. (Reuters News)</p>

<p>(Capital of Argentina) President Roosevelt arrived here today, the first time a U.S. head of state has visited Argentina. Argentine President Justo personally led the entire cabinet to give him a warm welcome. When the President passed through the streets, the people who had waited for hours in the scorching sun cheered wildly for him. The enthusiasm was rare. According to police estimates, from the pier to the U.S. Embassy, a distance of five miles, there were no less than one million people along the route to welcome him. President Roosevelt's flagship, the USS Indianapolis, was escorted into port by 15 Argentine warships. All ships in the harbor and factories on land sounded their horns in unison, and many planes also took to the air to welcome him. When President Roosevelt stepped off the warship, he smiled cordially and often embraced President Justo as a courtesy, and shook hands with other cabinet members one by one. Then he stepped into a car and was escorted to the U.S. Embassy by a well-uniformed team. Along the way, 12,000 soldiers assisted the police in maintaining order. The cordon was sometimes broken by the welcoming crowd. The presidential procession took 40 minutes in total. Roses were thrown along the way. After arriving at the embassy, the President retreated to the rest room, and then formally visited President Justo. (Guomin Electric, 30th)</p>

Crowds gathered outside the Presidential Palace to cheer. Roosevelt immediately went outside with Justo and shook hands with each other on the balcony as a courtesy. Afterwards, Roosevelt returned to the U.S. Embassy and received welcoming representatives from the American community. Dr. Gallo, President of the University of Argentina, also called on Roosevelt and presented him with an honorary doctorate. (Guomin Electric, 30th)</p>
<p>(Capital of Argentina) Argentine President Justo spoke with a reporter from the Associated Press today, predicting that President Roosevelt's visit to South America would consolidate the U.S. Good Neighbor Policy and make it a permanent one. Even if there are changes in future administrations, there is no risk of changing this policy. The Inter-American Peace Conference will also show the world that the Americas are continents that advocate peace and work for peace, and that all difficult problems can be happily resolved. As for the relationship between the United States and Argentina, President Roosevelt's trip will allow him to personally see Argentina's feelings for the United States. Justo also believes that commercial talks between the two countries are very likely to be established at this time, because this is the common wish of both countries, and he hopes that the Inter-American Conference can increase the opportunity to finally resolve the Gran Chaco dispute. (Guomin Electric, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain has huge commercial interests in Argentina, so it is paying close attention to President Roosevelt's arrival in the capital of that country.

<p>(Capital of Argentina) The Pan-American Peace Conference is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony tomorrow, and the news that Chile recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia has just been transmitted here at this time. Delegates from all countries were shocked by this. A delegate from a certain country declared that the Chilean ambassador to Argentina denied the possibility of this matter yesterday. If the country does recognize the Italian Empire, then the reconciliation and non-aggression pact established in October 1933 by all the countries of North and South America, including Chile, has been damaged. Regarding this matter, the Chilean government is said to be issuing a statement saying that this pact only applies to the Americas and cannot be extended outside the Americas.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden recently gave a speech at a banquet of the British branch of the International Chamber of Commerce, stating that "If Belgium is invaded by another country without provocation, Britain will come to its aid." French newspapers then reported that French Foreign Minister Delbos was about to deliver a speech stating that his country was willing to aid Britain with military force when necessary. Foreign affairs reporters from the Morning Post and Manchester Guardian have recently commented on this. The Morning Post stated that since Germany unilaterally abolished the Locarno Treaty, the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium immediately established temporary mutual assistance measures. The speech to be delivered by the French Foreign Minister is, in addition to these mutual assistance measures, another guarantee to Britain. "Although the French government is still striving for compromise with Germany and does not want to put the above mutual assistance measures into effect immediately, it has also decided that no matter what kind of agreement is reached in the future, it must provide unconditional guarantees to Britain. This is extremely important." The Manchester Guardian stated, "The situation in Europe is already extremely precarious. It is imperative that Western European countries take preventive measures to ensure security. However, the speech recently delivered by Foreign Secretary Eden and the speech to be delivered by French Foreign Minister Delbos in the future will not hinder the general solution of European problems."

<p>(London) Diplomatic circles here firmly believe that when Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano recently visited Germany, he and Führer Hitler agreed to divide Central Europe into German and Italian spheres of influence. The German sphere of influence includes the Czech Republic and Austria, while the Italian sphere of influence includes Hungary and Yugoslavia. Observers pointed out that relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia have recently improved. This can be seen from the fact that Hungarian Regent Horthy passed through Yugoslavia when visiting Italy. Observers also believe that Hungary is obviously afraid of Germany's outward expansion plans and is deeply concerned that Hungary will be encroached upon by it. Therefore, at present, rather than following Germany, it is better to lean towards Italy. Furthermore, the Hungarian government trusts Italy more for two reasons: first, Italy is not a neighboring country of Hungary and will not covet Hungarian territory; second, Italian foreign policy is more cautious. It is generally believed that if a conflict occurs in Europe, Italy will not immediately join either side. (Havas Electric, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e80">London Fire! Crystal Palace Reduced to Ashes; Sparks Spreading During Concert; Radio Transmission Station Also Destroyed <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>While a concert was being held in the Crystal Palace tonight, there was a sudden accident, and the fire spread very quickly, reducing the entire building to ashes. The actual loss cannot be estimated. The radio transmission machine, the world's newest type, which had recently been installed in the palace, was also completely destroyed, worth tens of thousands of pounds. Less than 20 minutes after the fire started, the central part of the building was completely engulfed in flames, and the sound of it collapsing could be heard a mile away.</p>
<p>At 7:30 tonight, while singing was in progress, a female staff member of the palace suddenly told the musicians that there was a fire in the palace, but there was no danger. Unexpectedly, five minutes later, the fire had penetrated into the room, and the orchestra hurriedly fled for their lives, narrowly escaping the inferno. Fire brigades from all over heard the alarm and rushed to the scene to help put out the fire. There were many spectators from all directions, causing traffic congestion. The flames shot high into the sky, and the red light illuminated the sky. Members of Parliament in the House of Commons eight miles away gathered on the balcony to watch.</p>
<p>Four hours after the alarm was raised, at 11:15, there were three loud explosions, which shook the surrounding area. At that time, everyone was concerned about the safety of the North Tower on the edge of the railway, and all trains were stopped. Almost all of the city's fire engines were mobilized. When the fire was at its fiercest, several filmmakers drove a plane close to the fire scene, moving in and out of the sky full of flying sparks to capture the scene. Their courageous spirit amazed the onlookers. At one point, the nose of the plane was clearly tilted straight down, threatening to fall into the inferno, but with a turn, it was safe again. The audience's hair stood on end. The members of the orchestra were frustrated because their precious instruments were lost in the fire, but they were extremely fortunate to have saved their lives, because a few seconds after they ran out, the front of the palace collapsed onto the road, burying many cars parked on the side of the road. The danger was indeed imminent.</p>
<p>The police ordered residents around the palace to leave their homes to prevent danger. Pedestrians half a mile away felt uneasy from the heat of the fire, not to mention the firefighters stationed on the roofs and ladders of nearby buildings, so they had to change shifts in a short time. The fact that the glass was melted into a liquid by the fire also showed the intensity of the heat. At present, the North and South Towers still stand tall, but the entire building has been reduced to ashes. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) A major fire occurred here last night, and the Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire. The flames reached a height of 600 feet, and there were more than 100,000 spectators. 350 firefighters worked hard to put out the fire. The fire alarm was raised at 8:30 in the evening, and all fire engines were dispatched. It was not extinguished until after midnight. Tens of thousands of gallons of water were poured. Only two towers remain. The loss is estimated at around £200,000. It is currently difficult to determine whether the radio transmission station in the tower can be preserved. The glass roof of the central grand circular hall collapsed when the fire was fierce, and ashes flew two miles away. (Guomin Electric, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) After the famous Crystal Palace in the southwestern district of the city was accidentally burned last night, it continued until 2:00 this morning. Its northern part was exacerbated by a sudden southerly wind. Fortunately, no one was injured. Hundreds of rare birds kept in the palace, which have always been famous in the world, were released during the fire and flew away. The Duke of Kent, on his fourth visit, attended a banquet somewhere last night. After the end of the banquet, he rushed to the scene after hearing the news, immediately changed into a leather cloak and long boots, and went in and out of dangerous areas with firefighters until 3:00 in the morning before returning. When the fire was at its fiercest, 56 water hoses were pouring water at the same time, so the two clock towers in the Crystal Palace were preserved. By dawn, only 10 water hoses continued to pour water. There were thousands of people surrounding and watching, all of whom stayed up all night. (Havas Electric, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The famous Crystal Palace in this city was completely destroyed by fire tonight. The four walls of the palace were made of glass, which immediately collapsed and shattered into pieces, the sound of which could be heard several miles away. The Crystal Palace was first completed in Hyde Park in 1851, as part of the exhibition hall at the time. Afterwards, it was rebuilt as a public amusement place on Norwood Hill Street in the southwestern district of London. It is no longer as well-known as it used to be, but there are still many Londoners who visit it every day, especially children. Now that it has been destroyed by fire, London has lost a popular amusement park. (Havas Electric, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The palace has been a famous place of entertainment in London for 85 years. Since it was completed in 1851, the grand events held there cannot be fully recorded. General Manager Sir Buckland said, "I am very saddened that there will never be a Crystal Palace again." The building was adequately insured against fire, but there are many treasures that cannot be obtained with money. The total loss is about £1.5 million. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese Garrison Headquarters here has held repeated meetings to discuss the problem of bandits and puppets violating Suiyuan. Following the arrival of Lieutenant General Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army, those who came to Tianjin for negotiations included Lieutenant General Sato, Military Councilor of the Japanese Army Ministry. He arrived on the 27th from Changchun, transiting, to meet with Field Marshal Tashiro, Commander of the Japanese Army, to convey the intentions of the Japanese central leadership. He met with Usukawa, head of the Japanese Residents' Association, Tamura, head of the Japanese Veterans Association, and others in Tianjin for consecutive days to exchange views on general important work during the so-called extraordinary period, and to investigate our movements. He plans to go to Peiping on December 5 to meet with Kawabe, commander of the Japanese Brigade, and Matsushita, the Japanese military attaché stationed in Peiping, and then transfer to Qingdao and Jinan on the 11th to meet with military attachés Tanizaki and Ishino in those two places. He will arrive in Shanghai on the 18th to meet with military attachés Kita and Kusumoto, and Commander Okawa of the Japanese Marines, and is scheduled to return home before the 25th to report. The Japanese military will base its preparations for strategies against us on the results of his activities. It is also reported that Ishihara Kanetsugu, head of the Operations Section of the Japanese General Staff, and Imada Shintaro, head of the Intelligence Section, arrived in Tianjin on the 28th of this month. These two brought plans from the Japanese General Staff for the event of war. According to their itinerary, they first went to Changchun from Tokyo at the beginning of this month to contact the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, and also attended the meeting of the Japanese Kwantung Army Division Commanders stationed in Manchuria on November 20. After synthesizing the opinions of that meeting, they came to Tianjin. On the day of their arrival in Tianjin, Commander Tashiro of the Japanese Army convened a meeting at the Haiguang Temple Headquarters, attended by Hashimoto Gun, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, and Staff Officers Iida, Wachi, Senda, and Ikeda, as well as Regiment Commanders Kayashima, Mutaguchi, and Suzuki. Ishihara reported the intentions of the Japanese General Staff and the opinions of the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters. Then Hashimoto Gun reported on the current situation of the troops stationed in North China and the deployment of the Japanese army. The meeting lasted from 2 PM to 6 PM. At 9:15 AM on the 29th, Ishihara and Imada left Tianjin to visit Kawabe and Matsushita in Beiping to exchange views. On the 30th, they flew to Zhangbei and Shangdu to conduct reconnaissance and meet with De Wang and Li Shouxin to discuss matters, then transferred to Changchun to confer with Ueda and Itagaki. They will return home at the beginning of next month. In the future, the war strategies instructed by the Japanese General Staff will also take the opinions of the Kwantung Army and the Tianjin Garrison Army as a certain point to carry out production. It is also heard that the two military headquarters have quite a bit of consultation on the planning of the Suiyuan affair. Ishihara's additional task is to reconcile the opinions of both parties to make them consistent, so that the steps will not be chaotic when launching the campaign. After the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters issued a statement on the Suiyuan incident on the 28th, the future war situation has been shown to the world. Although the Peiping-Tianjin area is not within the war zone, the situation is still very tense under the influence. From the 28th, the Japanese Second Infantry Regiment and part of the Artillery Regiment, combined with part of the Chemical Warfare Team, held temporary large-scale exercises in Dabi Village, Fan Zizhuang, and other places in the suburbs of Tianjin. More than 1,600 people from various arms of service participated, divided into attacking and defending parties with the goal of vying for Tianjin. The exercise time was from 8 AM to 10 PM, camping in the wild until December 2nd. At the same time, Commander Tashiro of the Japanese Army, accompanied by Chief of Staff Hashimoto and Staff Officers Senda and Asai, went to Tanggu and the east to Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Luanxian, and Yu County on November 30 to inspect the troops. Also, on the evening of the 28th, the destroyer "Sasan" from Lushun Port sailed into Tanggu Port for berthing, preparing for the protection of overseas Chinese in case of unexpected events. Such actions seem to have the intention of threatening Hebei and Chahar. (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">A Record of Inspecting Suiyuan: Our Troops in Eastern Suiyuan and Suihua Have Very Solid Defense Lines; Extremely Many Military Supplies Were Obtained When Capturing Bailingmiao <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the puppet bandit troops of Chahar and Bei repeatedly invaded Eastern and Northern Suiyuan, in order to understand the truth of the front, the reporter left Peiping on the 24th of last month to conduct an on-the-spot investigation along the Peiping-Suiyuan line. During that time, I passed through Datong, Fengzhen, Jining (Pingdiquan), Honggeertu, Suiyuan, Baotou, Bailingmiao and other places, and separately visited military and political figures in various places. After a week, I returned to Peiping yesterday. The report on the findings of this trip is as follows:</p>
<p>The Actual Strength of the Puppet Bandits</p>
<p>After the reporter set off, he separately inquired about the strength of the puppet bandits. It is learned that after De Wang expanded the Mongolian army and occupied the six counties of Chahar North, Wang Ying's bandit troops followed and went there. Finally, Li Shouxin's puppet army also arrived from Dolon. After the puppet bandits gathered in northern Chahar, Li Shouxin's puppet army, De Wang's Mongol puppet army, and Wang Ying's bandit army stood divided. Li's troops were organized into the First Army, under the jurisdiction of Yin Baoshan and other troops, claiming to be four divisions, totaling 10,000 people, stationed in Shangdu, Huade, Nanhaogou, Daqinggou (that is, Shangyi), Yin's troops stationed in Shangdu, and Li sometimes traveled between Nanhaogou and Daqinggou. De Wang's Mongol army, under the puppet military Bao Yueqing, Zhuoshihai, Mu Zhenbao and other Mongolian security teams, numbered no more than 10,000 people, mostly in Jiabus, Bailingmiao, and other places. De Wang himself often went to Jiabus and occasionally flew to Bailingmiao to direct everything. Wang Ying led Zhang Wanxin's First Division, Jin Jiasan and Ma Yutian's Brigade, and the seven or eight thousand people of the pistol regiment and the guard regiment, stationed in the Tonglingdi area, also claiming to be four divisions. The three divisions occupy the line from Bailingmiao, via Tumuerte, Honggentu, Dayanhai, and northern Xinghe, to Nanhaogou, Zhangbei, and Chongli.</p>
<p>Strengthening Jining's Defenses</p>
<p>After the puppet army completed its layout in Chahar, Shangyi was thousands of miles away from Xinghe, and Shangdu was only a hundred miles away from Jining. Jining is an important town on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway and a pivotal point between Shanxi and Suiyuan Provinces. For months, they have been trying to achieve their goals at any time. In order to ensure Suiyuan's transportation, our officers and soldiers, aware of their responsibility to defend the territory, have been extra careful in their defenses, making it extremely difficult for the puppet bandits to succeed.</p>
<p>Failed Invasions</p>
<p>At the beginning of last month, the bandits, believing that the time had come, once invaded Xinghe but were repelled by Gao Tuan of the Li Division of the defending army. In the middle of the month, the bandit puppet army concentrated more than 1,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery to invade Honggeertu (that is, Honggentu) west of Shangdu and north of Taolin. Zhao Chengshou's cavalry, Fu Zuoyi and Li Fuying's infantry, and other troops separately fought back fiercely for three days and nights. The bandit puppet army even used airplanes to help in the battle. On the third day, three aircraft were finally shot down by our army's accurate artillery team. At this point, the entire puppet bandit force retreated. When the aircraft were injured and descended, the local military and civilians cheered the situation. General Fu Zuoyi specially awarded 1,000 yuan to show encouragement. It is reported that the bandits' invasion plan was to invade Wulanhua from Honggeertu in the west, go straight to Baotou via Guyang, and at the same time another group was planned to cross hundreds of miles of uninhabited area from Shangdu to Jiutai, Shitai, and Shiyitai, directly reaching Wuchuan and taking Guihua. Another team would feint an attack on Xinghe from Nanhaogou to try to contain the national army's strength. Although the soldiers of our national army ate fried rice in the freezing weather every day, their spirits were lifted, and their morale was high. They did not feel bitter at all when fighting with the bandits and puppets.</p>
<p>Chuan-Shi's Calm</p>
<p>General Fu Zuoyi, as the chairman of Suiyuan Province and commander of the 35th Army, personally presided over everything. Since the suppression of bandits and armies, he has been calm and relaxed. Dressed in an admiral's uniform, he did not take it off all day, and was busy deploying military affairs on one hand and diligently entertaining on the other, and his attitude was as if he was not tired at all. He did not sleep for two days while planning the attack on Bailingmiao, so his face was slightly thinner. In Suiyuan, the people felt a little panicked before the military was launched. After the bandits were disturbed and defeated, the people felt more stable. The local area was as usual, without any war state, and life was also very stable. However, the inspection of passengers was very strict. There were military police inspections in the trains from Datong to Suiyuan, and the passengers' surnames and origins were inquired in detail to prevent spies from taking the opportunity to mix in.</p>
<p>Zhao Chengshou's Talk</p>
<p>When the reporter passed through Jining, he visited Zhao Chengshou, the commander of the cavalry army. According to him, his headquarters has been stationed on the border of Shanxi and Suiyuan for several years, and the bandits have been suppressed. However, there are now puppet bandits invading again, and the officers and soldiers are extremely indignant. On the 13th of this month, I went to Pingdiquan with Chairman Fu from Sui to learn that the puppet bandits in northern Chahar had the potential to strike a blow. At that time, the foremost Qian of our army was Honggeertu, and the garrison there was only two companies. When the telegraph order was sent to the regiment commander to order the troops to defend to the death, and to send teams to reinforce within twelve hours. On the 16th, the bandits attacked with 3,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, intending to capture Pingdiquan and cut off our traffic. So the fierce battle began and continued until dawn on the 18th. The bandits even invaded our main positions with four bandit aircraft to help in the battle. Our artillery team shot down three of the aircraft and completely defeated the bandits. At the same time, because the puppet bandits occupied Bailingmiao, Suiyuan and Northern Suiyuan were threatened at times. On the 23rd, my cavalry division, Chairman Fu's infantry, and Commander Wang's replenishment regiment were concentrated to launch a large-scale attack at 9 PM that night. By 9 AM the next morning, the temple was completely recovered. The military supplies, food, and other items that the bandits had stockpiled in the temple for many years were all obtained by our army. This is the result of the soldiers' dedication and clear understanding of justice. In the future, we must continue to work hard to strengthen the country for the country.</p>
<p>Wang Jingguo's Talk</p>
<p>After the reporter arrived in Suiyuan, Wang Jingguo also arrived in Guihua, and immediately sent a name card to visit. Briefly noted the following conversation: "After I was ordered to take over the 19th Army, because the military headquarters was located in Taiyuan, most of the 70th Division was stationed in Suiyuan, so I have been traveling between Shanxi and Suiyuan for years. I have entrusted Brigade Commander Tian Shumei to be responsible for the defenses of western Suiyuan. I heard in the military that the Bailingmiao puppet bandits were preparing to attack us, so I immediately set off and returned. Before the Suiyuan were captured, I heard that Bailingmiao had been recovered, and I was very happy. Because I have matters to be discussed with Chairman Fu, I came to Sui first, and I will go to western Suiyuan to handle military affairs and inspect the reclamation area within days. The reclamation situation this year is still good, and I will plan the reclamation work for next year when I go this time," he said.</p>
<p>Li Fuying's Talk</p>
<p>On his way back, the reporter got off at Datong and visited Commander Li Fuying, who gave the following speech, "In this battle, in which the bandits and puppets invaded westward, our army, under the principle of defending the soil and resisting insults, is determined to "have bandits without me, and have me without bandits" and is determined to fight to the end. Although my department has been defeated by the command of Director Yan and Commander Fu, and the bandits and puppets attacking Xinghe have been defeated. Even though part of my army participated in the Battle of Honggeertu, it is the duty of soldiers to serve in the borderlands. However, I am extremely ashamed to have been visited by people from all walks of life and to have received the enthusiastic condolences of the elders of the whole country. According to reports, the bandits and puppets are now gathering troops and planning a large-scale invasion to the west, which shows that the border trouble is in full swing, and the small victories in the past battles are not enough to talk about. From now on, we can only encourage the soldiers to be more vigilant, in order to strengthen the border defense, to comfort the people of the country, and to fulfill the duties of the army. I also hope that people across the country will supervise and guide us at any time," he said (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Bandits and Puppets Are Preparing Their Main Forces, Attempting to Counterattack Bailingmiao; Officers from a Certain Party Are Arriving in Jiabus Temple from Dolon; The Remnants of the Bandits and Puppets Are Gradually Gathering Towards Pangjiang and Shangdu <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Shangdu Correspondence: Since Bailingmiao was recovered by our Suiyuan army, it has directly dealt a huge blow to the bandits and puppets, and indirectly created a huge obstacle to a certain party's policy of opening up Chahar and Suiyuan. Now the leaders of a certain party and the bandits and puppets are holding secret meetings at Jiabus Temple (that is, the Huade Administrative Bureau), with very strict security. According to the bandits and puppets, they will never easily give up Bailingmiao. It is not only important in terms of combat strategy, but also the loss of military supplies is indeed not subsidized. Therefore, they are actively preparing their main forces in an attempt to counterattack. Under this situation, the bandits and puppets are also very active. Their situation is described below:</p>
<p>More Than 100 Officers From a Certain Party Arrive at the Temple</p>
<p>On November 26, more than 100 officers from a certain party traveled in five cars from Dolon to Jiabus Temple, arriving on the 27th. They brought many military Chahar-Suiyuan maps and various forms. In addition, a large amount of military supplies and coal were continuously transported from Zhangbei to Jiabus Temple and Shangdu. According to internal sources of the bandits and puppets, more than 3,000 new-style guns were lost in the two failures of Bailingmiao and Honggeertu, some of which were taken by the Suiyuan army, and some were taken by defecting troops and deserters. On the 26th, ten heavy trucks of new guns were transported from Zhangbei and distributed to various departments for replenishment. As for cotton-padded uniforms, six trucks have now been transported to Shangdu.</p>
<p>It Is Difficult to Build Fortifications in the Cold Weather</p>
<p>Since the national army recaptured Bailingmiao, the bandit puppet Mongols who attacked northern Suiyuan fled to the hinterland of northern Suiyuan and Pangjiang Erlian and other places. Most of them retreated east to Shangdu. Now, the bandits and puppets who have fled to Pangjiang and the hinterland are gathering towards Pangjiang, reaching more than 7,000 people, and will also be opening towards Shangdu. On the 27th, more than 1,000 artillery soldiers from the Jia Ge Ying area opened to Rehe. Except for the Gan Ying and Li Shouxin armies stationed in Shangdu, there are also 2,000 Rehe puppet soldiers under Wang Jingxiu, who have opened to the west to join Li Zhenming's puppet troops in guarding the Qianqian. The attitudes of the chief rebels are still determined to be reckless, and they are forcing laborers to rush to build defensive projects day and night. However, due to the cold weather, progress is difficult and it is not easy to complete quickly. The bandits and puppets are urging the construction. As for all the wounded soldiers, no one cares about them, and the rescue equipment is also very inadequate. Many people die one after another due to the cold weather and excessive blood loss.</p>
<p>Wang Ying's Bandits Have Different Ambitions</p>
<p>Wang Ying's bandit troops have been increasingly despised by a certain party since their defeat in Hongzhen. Their subordinates also have different ambitions. On the night of November 26, Wang and Yin Baoshan held a secret meeting, and they almost broke down on the spot due to disagreements. Other middle and lower-level officers have also been secretly discussing in recent days. A certain party is even more suspicious of them. Li Shouxin's army has now been sent to monitor Wang's actions. As for Wang's subordinates, there are still more than 3,000 people. Wang has sent more than 60 of his confidants to secretly recruit troops in the interior from Shangdu on the 28th.</p>
<p>Bandits and Puppet Intelligence Is Sent to Changchun Daily</p>
<p>The activities of the bandits and puppets in northern Chahar are reported to Changchun via radio every day. All radio transmitting and receiving technical personnel are nationals of a certain country, and there are also troops from a certain country guarding them. In Guyuan, Dolon, and places adjacent to Rehe, bandit troops from the Hot Border are constantly arriving, and residents are extremely panicked. Therefore, the current situation in northern Chahar is already in an extremely terrifying state. Those with a little property have fled to various places in the inland one after another. (28th)</p>

<p>Zhou Mingyang, a student of Cuiying Middle School, participated in a propaganda team and set off for propaganda on the Six-Three Anti-Smoking Memorial Day this year. He unfortunately fell into the river and died on the way. The teachers and students of the school have held a memorial service. For the sake of commemorating Zhou Mingyang, the Anti-Smoking Committee here has initiated the establishment of a memorial tablet at the foot of Tiger Hill to commemorate it, and specially elected Zhang Yanpeng to plan and proceed, and also recommended Wu Zengshan to draft the memorial tablet inscription.</p>

<p>Xie Sheng Cotton House in Sanyu Town used a car from the city to transport 15,000 yuan back to the town, but it was robbed by bandits in Jiujiaba. The bandits were captured by the detective team and handed over to the Fourth District Security Command for interrogation. On the 30th, the two chief culprits, Ji Youen and Cao Yingde, were approved by the provincial government to be sentenced to death and were taken to the scene of the incident and executed by firing squad. The accomplices Ji Rongfang was sentenced to twelve years in prison, and Cao Changyuan and Cao Yangshi were sentenced to seven years in prison each, and sent to the Fourth Jiangsu Prison for execution.</p>

<p>The prisoners Xue Wu et al. of Taicang County Prison, Guardhouse, and the separate confinement area for drug offenders, in the name of pseudo-bandits invading Suiyuan, and our front-line soldiers, are defending the country and killing enemies in the freezing cold, with great differences in hardship and happiness. The prisoners, although deprived of freedom, still have obligations. Therefore, on the 29th, they voluntarily went on a one-day hunger strike, and the remaining food expenses of forty yuan and two cents were submitted to the front by Warden Zhang via the county government. In addition, the town and rural merchants, organizations, and groups in the county held a one-day sports event, and the remaining support for Suiyuan was also very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Gu Arong, a resident of Dai Lane, Nanfangquan, District 3, over forty years old, was a farmer. At 9 AM the day before yesterday, he brought self-brewed white wine to his biological mother, Gu Yangshi, at Gedaiqiao, and drank with his younger brother, Gu Apei. Unexpectedly, Yangshi was seriously ill at the time. At that time, the two brothers discussed how to handle the funeral after their mother's death and how to distribute the economy. They disagreed and immediately took action. As a result, Arong was injured and died. Xiao Ruyuan, the head of the 84th map, and Gu Haiwu, the head of the 14th Bao, reported to the local court and requested an autopsy. Yesterday (1st), at 9 AM, Prosecutor Shen led officials to the countryside for an autopsy.</p>

At 4 PM on the 30th of last month, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen in the southwest corner of the warehouse, spreading to the nearby firewood room and warehouse, and it was out of control, piercing through the roof. The fire brigades and police stations in each section immediately drove the dragons to the scene to draw water for rescue. It took about an hour before it was extinguished. A total of eight warehouses were burned down, and the loss was quite large. At the same time, Qian Yingsheng, Wu Asan, and other three families in Houchun Village, Xicao Lane, Zhouxin Town, District 3, also suffered from carelessness, with a loss of more than a thousand yuan. Also, the home of Wu Jinchun on Yantou Street, Xuedian Town, District 8, suddenly reported a fire, which spread to the neighbors and turned into scorched earth. The situation was terrible.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Jinhua: Legal Entities Request Re-measurement of Land <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The land registration and survey in Jinhua County is riddled with errors, leading to repeated disputes. Representatives from the county's farmers' association Cao Jingtai, education association Wang Zhensheng, chamber of commerce Cheng Shirong, labor union Huang Xiuchan, and citizens Fang Hao, Qian Xietong, Liao Yingduo, Qian Youren, Tang Bingkun, and others, jointly submitted a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting a re-measurement of land in order to clarify property rights and alleviate the people's suffering. An excerpt of the original submission is as follows:</p>
<p>"The land under the county's jurisdiction has always been based on contracts. Except for communal properties, which are referred to as a certain hall or room, all grain households are registered in their own names. The grain registers clearly record the number, acreage, location, and category of each plot, with very few errors. However, the previous county magistrate, Chen Kaisi, under the guise of implementing new policies, hastily initiated a land registration and survey. Last July, he recruited over a hundred students, calling them a rural work personnel training class, and hired three or four college students as trainers. After more than a month of training, they were dispatched to various locations to carry out the work. From the very beginning, the process was so sloppy. As for the survey itself, neither the landowners nor the tenants were notified. In each village, a random shepherd boy was hired as a guide, leading to absurd mistakes. The surveyors did not measure the land or verify information, relying solely on oral records, perpetuating errors. As a result, local names and plot locations became garbled, and the distinction between public and private ownership was blurred. Even irrigation systems were arbitrarily registered without any supporting evidence, which will inevitably lead to major disputes in times of drought. In summary, the problems are as follows: (1) Disruption of the irrigation system; (2) Arbitrary division of land into upper, middle, and lower grades, with corresponding variations in acreage; (3) Omissions in registration; (4) Incorrect or duplicate registration; (5) Fraudulent claims; (6) Re-measurement fees: This survey is riddled with errors, and the people have collectively requested corrections. A so-called re-measurement is being conducted, but in reality, no actual measurement is taking place. Yet, a fee of $1.20 is charged for each re-measured parcel; (7) Unilateral applications: Re-measurement is granted based on the application of one party without notifying the other party involved; (8) Increased acreage: Surveyors often record the acreage of mountain fields as being ten or even dozens of times greater than the original acreage. When asked why the discrepancy, they claim it is based on visual estimation. The surveyors can manipulate the acreage at will, and their salaries are based on the acreage measured, so listing more acres means more income; (9) Excessive collection of land ownership certificate fees: The county government claims that the survey is complete, but less than 30-40% of the registrations have been verified. Yet, the people are being ordered to exchange their land ownership certificates. The certificates are nowhere to be seen, but the price of the certificate has already risen to seven cents each. The above are just the most glaring examples. Other issues, such as surveyors abusing their power for personal gain and oppressing the local population, are minor matters. The representatives previously appealed to the former county magistrate, who was responsible for handling the matter, but were forced to wait for its completion. The problems have only increased with time, and the consequences are unimaginable. We can no longer remain silent. The land ownership certificates have not yet been issued, and it is not too late to rectify the situation. Therefore, we dare to present the circumstances and the resulting problems, pleading for a thorough investigation and the complete overturning of this flawed policy, with a re-measurement of land to alleviate the people's suffering and attach importance to land administration."</p>

<h3 id="e96">Li Zhenzhong Arrives in Shanghai to Help the Xin Team Fight Pirates Tonight; Fudan and Chih Chih Win Last Night <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Basketball star Li Zhenzhong was invited by the Xin team to come to Shanghai from Beijing this morning. He will participate in the West Qing basketball game tonight to help defeat the Xintong Pirates team. Xu Zhaoxiong has also decided to participate, which will greatly strengthen the Xin team's strength. The current Xintong team has greatly declined in strength since Smith's absence. They almost lost to the Hornets the night before and lost both games in their expedition to Nanjing. Therefore, with the help of Li and Xu, the Xin team should be able to defeat the Xintong Pirates, the perennial champions, tonight. Tonight's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Qingguang vs. Mailingjia (Independent) at 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Xin Team vs. Xintong (Independent) at 9:00 PM</p>
<p>Both games the night before were very intense. Nanching and Nanyang tied 13-13 in the first half. Nanyang took the lead at 20-18 and 21-19 in the second half, but Nanching caught up and won 29-21. In the other game, Xintong vs. Hornets, Xintong's strength was greatly reduced due to the absence of the long-legged Lan Yin. The Hornets, knowing they were no match, fought desperately. Xintong led 18-12 in the first half, but the Hornets were very active in the second half, taking the lead repeatedly. In the last two minutes, Zhang Wenyuan scored a basket to take the lead at 23-22. If they could have calmly responded, they could have pulled off an upset and defeated Xintong. Unfortunately, they became flustered and repeatedly committed fouls, resulting in nine free throws for Xintong. Fortunately, Xintong was also eager to win and panicked, only making one point to tie the score at 23-23. Finally, Carson scored to win a lucky victory over the Hornets at 25-23.</p>
<p>Both university group games last night were one-sided. Fudan's win over St. John's was quite tense in the first half, but St. John's was unsuccessful in the second half, and Fudan won 46-28 overall. Chih Chih performed particularly well in the second game. The team has defeated Jinan and Fudan and seems to be the dominant force in Shanghai university basketball. The work of the three forwards under the basket is unmatched in Shanghai, and they took advantage of the weak defense of their opponent, Tongji. The result was 48-25, but Chih Chih only led by two points in the first half. The scores of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanching defeated Nanyang</p>
<p>Xintong defeated Hornets</p>
<p>Fudan defeated St. John's</p>
<p>Chih Chih defeated Tongji</p>

<p>The Chinese Sports Federation Women's Basketball Championship was originally scheduled to open yesterday with Patriotic vs. Qixiu. However, Patriotic Girls' High School was unable to attend due to preparations for its 35th anniversary. They had previously requested the Chinese Sports Federation not to participate or to postpone the match. Therefore, the committee will decide today whether to rule Patriotic's withdrawal or reschedule the game, and will announce it publicly. If Patriotic does withdraw, only Qixiu and Chongde will remain. It is currently difficult to determine whether the competition will continue.</p>

<p>In the amateur billiards team league, the match between Zhongqing and Xiqing was originally scheduled to be played by the fourth and second players. However, the lineup was changed at the last minute, with the main players Ding Mingyi and Max of both sides suddenly appearing. The audience was greatly excited. The game started at 6:00 PM and ended at 7:30 PM. During the hour and a half, there were many amazing changes. At the beginning of the match, Ding was familiar with the table and made several consecutive shots, leaving Max behind by more than fifty points, creating a one-sided situation. However, Max was very skilled and used clever techniques, successfully sinking balls and quickly catching up to around 200 points. The two players were evenly matched for a while, forming a competitive situation. Just before the outcome was decided, the god of luck suddenly favored Ding, who scored about ten points with each shot, while Max missed several good opportunities. Gradually, Ding Mingyi defeated Max with a score of 300 to 246. Ding's highest scores were 43, 30, and 23, while Max's was 36.

<h3 id="e113">After Completing Attendance at the Pacific Society Meeting, Hu Shi Returns to China and Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Public Lecture at the YMCA at 7:30 PM Tonight <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shi, the chief representative of China attending the Pacific Society meeting, returned to China yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM on the Empress of Japan ship of the Meiliang Changxing Company and arrived in Shanghai. Hu's friends went to the port to welcome him. Hu also scheduled a public lecture at the YMCA tonight, and will return to Beijing tomorrow. The Central News Agency reporter recorded the following details:</p>
<p>Friends Welcomed: The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Pier. Those who went to welcome him included Li Dachao, section chief of the Municipal Government; Zhou Jue, director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Cheng Haifeng, head of the China branch of the National Labor Bureau; Zhu Changnian, superintendent of the Jianghai Customs; Xu Xinliu, of the Banking Association; Yan Fuqing, of the Chinese Red Cross Society; Yao Xi, of the Aviation Association; Liu Yuwan, of the China branch of the Pacific Society; Li Zhaohuan, president of Jiaotong University; Jian Youwen, member of the Legislative Yuan; and Xue Dubi, and others, totaling dozens of people. Mr. Hu's demeanor was the same as before, and he was slightly more obese than when he went abroad. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming personnel, he went directly to the International Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Hernia Fully Recovered: Mr. Hu met with reporters on the ship and gave a speech, saying that the representatives who had returned to China earlier had already reported on the proceedings of attending the Pacific Society meeting. He will give a more detailed report at the YMCA tomorrow night (tonight). While in the United States, he suffered from a hernia (Veutal Hornia), which was surgically repaired. He had an appendicitis attack four years ago, which was surgically removed. This time, a part of the intestine protruded into the gap in the skin that had already been operated on, causing the condition. After being sewn up, he has recovered, and is using a truss to support the affected area. Reports that he had appendicitis are not true.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in the United States: I was in the United States for four months and left on November 12th. At that time, the country was holding presidential elections, and all political parties were busy with the election and had no time to care about international issues. Roosevelt won an unprecedented victory with the largest majority of 63%. In the next four years, the people of that country will definitely support the government more, and the government's power will definitely be strengthened.</p>
<p>Good Feelings Toward China: Regarding the attitude of the United States towards China, American newspapers previously had some misunderstandings about Chinese public opinion. Recently, because our country has been completely unified and its diplomacy has been quite tough, based on the principle of not losing sovereignty, the public opinion has been unanimously praised. The president of the Associated Press, He Huaide, after returning to the United States from China, wrote an essay praising all the construction of our country and said that China has undoubtedly become a unified country.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing Tomorrow Night: Regarding the Japan-Germany agreement and the recent situation in the Far East, Mr. Hu said that he had been out of touch with the situation for many days during his travels. He also said that he only represented Peking University, Nankai University, and the Academia Sinica to attend the Pacific Society meeting. While in the United States, Harvard University and the University of Puget Sound awarded him honorary doctorate degrees. He is scheduled to return to Beijing on the evening of the 3rd.</p>
<p>Receptions and Lectures: The City International Affairs Research Association, Banking Association, Qianye Guild, YMCA, City Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, World Chinese Student Association, Taxpaying Chinese Association, Pacific International Association, Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Various Universities and other groups have scheduled a banquet for Mr. Hu at the YMCA at Baxianqiao at 6:30 PM tonight, and invited Mr. Hu to give a public lecture at 7:30 PM, titled "Reflections on Return." Tomorrow night at 8:00 PM, the International Affairs Research Association, the Pan-Pacific Association, and the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Various Universities will hold a banquet for Mr. Hu at the International Hotel. It is reported that Mr. Hu will give a lecture in English on "The Evolving Pacific" during the banquet.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Supervisory and Assessment Methods in the Movement to Implement Free Education <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In addition to classes and lectures, this year's training class for free education personnel from the Ministry of Education also discussed practical issues related to free education. The National Free Education Committee of the Ministry of Education also submitted issues for discussion. The discussions focused on issues related to supervision and assessment of free education. All decided opinions and methods will generally be followed by the Ministry of Education and various provinces and cities in the future. The general methods of supervision and assessment are summarized below, which should be welcomed by national supervisors and those administering free education.</p>
<p>Regarding Supervision:</p>
<p>A. Measures for dividing free education supervision areas between the central and local governments. After discussion, it was decided that this area-based supervision should first be implemented at the level of the Ministry, provinces, and cities. Counties and elementary school districts do not need to be divided. The division of areas in each province and city should be based on teacher training areas or administrative inspectorate areas, with room for flexibility. Ministry supervision personnel should supervise the free education areas under their jurisdiction at least once a year. Provincial and municipal supervision personnel should supervise the free education areas under their jurisdiction at least once per semester. Supervision personnel from the Ministry and provinces should focus on random inspections, while municipal supervision personnel should focus on comprehensive supervision. For comprehensive inspections, Ministry supervisors should selectively inspect at least one-fifth of the counties and cities under their jurisdiction each year, and provincial supervisors should selectively inspect at least one-third of the elementary school districts under their jurisdiction each year. The duties of supervisors at all levels should be stipulated by the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education or the National Free Education Committee should formulate standards for comprehensive and detailed inspections of free education. The number of free education inspectors should be determined by each province and city based on actual needs. B. The titles of free education inspectors should be standardized. After discussion, it was decided that the titles should be uniformly designated as "Supervisors," and the Ministry should issue a circular to all provinces and cities for compliance. C. How should the administrative structures of educational supervision be communicated and connected? After discussion, it was decided that in addition to ordinary administrative liaison, supervision meetings should be held every year (the Ministry of Education convenes meetings of provincial supervisors, the Education Department convenes meetings of district supervisors, the administrative district convenes meetings of county supervisors, and the county education administrative organs convene meetings of supervision personnel from each school district). Administrative organizations at all levels should improve their organization with reference to the supervisory outlines of Anhui Province and the guidance conference methods of Zhejiang Province. If there are more than three supervision personnel at each level, a director may be appointed to coordinate their efforts and facilitate communication. Supervisors at all levels must first review the reports on supervision within their districts by the higher-level supervisors before conducting their supervision. Lower-level supervisors should accept the guidance of higher-level supervisors. The supervision personnel of the education administrative organs should liaise effectively with the guidance personnel of the education organs (as already implemented in Jiangsu). Supervision personnel should primarily conduct supervision by district, as this facilitates communication between higher and lower levels. D. How should the duties of supervisors at all levels (originally "督學," changed to "視導人員") be defined with regard to the work of supervising free education? After discussion, it was decided that a clear statement should be included in the regulations for supervisors at all levels, specifying the supervision of compulsory education, as well as defining supervisory principles, supervisory focus, supervisory points, supervisory methods, supervisory steps, and supervisory reports. In addition, standards for supervising free education should be established based on the regulations for supervisors at all levels. E. It was decided that supervision of free education should pay special attention to nineteen items, including school equipment, administrative structure, student enrollment, assessment, and district division. F. It was decided that supervision personnel should provide guidance and encourage teachers to improve and conduct research on their own initiative. G. Regarding the continuing education and research methods for supervision personnel, after discussion, it was decided that they should browse newly published education books and newspapers, organize reading groups and visit groups, hold meetings of supervision personnel, conduct lectures and training for supervision personnel, conduct correspondence research, and the Ministry of Education should compile and distribute a catalogue of books and newspapers that supervision personnel should read to all provinces and cities for reference.</p>
<p>Regarding Assessment:</p>
<p>In addition to stipulating various assessment items, methods of calculation, and requesting the Ministry of Education to consult with each province and city to formulate various reward and punishment measures based on the effective methods of implementing free education in each province and city, regarding the reward measures for local people who voluntarily run free education, it was decided to request the Ministry of Education to formulate reward measures, paying attention to both spiritual and material rewards. For spiritual rewards, written or certificate formats should be used. For material rewards, a portion of the funds from the free education budget or other surplus education funds should be used to subsidize the schools as a reward to local people who voluntarily run excellent elementary schools. The advantages and disadvantages of mutual supervision between supervision personnel and education organs were also discussed. It was generally agreed that the exchange supervision in Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City was quite effective, and other provinces and cities could refer to it. The advantages are that it can prevent supervision personnel from acting on emotions, using public office for private gain, and prevent unfair facts from occurring. Supervision reports can be accurate because both parties are supervising each other and dare not make false reports. If the supervised personnel are treated unfairly, they can have the opportunity to defend themselves. The disadvantages are that as a result of mutual supervision, they can attack each other, each sticking to their own version, and the truth is not easy to clarify. As a result of mutual supervision, the responsible superior shows distrust of the supervision personnel he has appointed. If the directly appointed person cannot be trusted, then the indirectly supervised personnel are even less trustworthy. If the two parties collude and cooperate in intelligence, it will be more difficult for the responsible superior to investigate. Finally, the conference decided that the nature of education supervision is different from that of ordinary administrative official inspections, and attention should be paid to active guidance. There is no need for mutual supervision, because mutual supervision makes it impossible for the education sector to trust each other from top to bottom, which easily leads to adverse results.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Food: Everyone is Storing Grass and Grain; Flour Price Has Reached Four Yuan, Unprecedented Since the Establishment of the Exchange; The Market Was Stalled Due to the One-Corner Limit <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market in each month showed a crazy rise again. The price of foreign wheat was quoted in Chicago, up another corner, Canada up three or four corners, and Liverpool up one penny. As the world wheat price has been rising, and the domestic wheat has been falling again, and the prices of all kinds of goods have been rising without falling, the background is as if the whole world is shrouded in the clouds of war, causing people to panic. Storing grass and grain is so urgent that there is no time to choose, and everyone is preparing with raw materials. The price increases in the market are all based on this. When the price opened, this month immediately rose by eight points, and then continued to rise by two points, while in one transaction it fell back by two or three points. January started, and it rose by seven or eight points at first, but in April it rose by one corner compared to the previous month. Therefore, after the second transaction, except for this month, which was still two and a half cents short, the rest all rose to one corner. The turnover reached 700,000 to 800,000 in half a day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the exchange temporarily increased the margin to 500 yuan, and the market sentiment in each month was less traded due to the one-corner limit, so it was virtually stalled. Observing this kind of market price is the highest record since the establishment of the exchange, and the surrounding environment is still impossible to remedy, so the future storm is really beyond the ordinary speculation.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Foreign Wheat Continues to Rise; Domestic Wheat Rises Unprecedentedly; April Futures Have Reached Six Yuan and Ninety-Two Cents <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after the opening in the morning, the rise of the market in each month was as intense as if it had reached boiling point, because the price of foreign wheat has continued to rise consistently since the end of the previous month and yesterday's report, especially Liverpool. This situation is no different from the world's unanimous military preparations, and not only wheat has continued to rise, but also the prices of various domestic oils have also followed step by step. Therefore, after the opening, people's hearts were greatly stirred. The opening price in this month immediately rose by one corner and three or four points, and from January onwards, it also followed the rise by one corner and two or three points to one corner and eight points. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market price rose to the limit price due to the sharp rise in the flour market, so the buying interest was even stronger. Except for the old longs who sold back, there were very few new shorts. Therefore, each month continued to rise by five, six or seven points. For example, the rise in April reached two and a half corners. The highest point in the market reached six yuan and ninety-two cents. The rise was unprecedented, and the price was also a landmark. The current wheat market is hoarding, and very few transactions are seen. The ordinary high price opened at six yuan and two corners, followed by zero and nine points, with a transaction volume of over a thousand bags.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Under the Control of Dalian, Soybean Cake Prices are Rising Frequently; Countries are Storing Grain, Causing a Sharp Rise in the Dalian Market; This Port is Affected <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's standard market price of soybean cake was consistently rising, because the international war clouds are getting thicker, and there are rumors that various countries are storing grain, and the Dalian telegrams are also rising one after another. Yesterday, the price of soybeans rose by a corner, the price of oil rose by half a yuan, and the price of cake rose by four points. Therefore, the market sentiment was agitated, and the price of cotton yarn also rose sharply, which made the buyers even more excited. Various firms dared not sell out, so the opening price in the morning immediately soared. Although it was once suppressed by the liquidation of old longs, the new hoarding interest was very strong, and the result was still rising. The closing price of standard oil rose by four corners and a half to seven corners and a half, the standard soybeans rose by one corner and seven points and two or three points, and the standard cake also rose by three, five or six points.</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market, because the rising wind in Dalian was still strong, the standard soybeans opened on the exchange in this city, and the price soared by one or two corners, which caused the spot price of soybean oil to continue to rise by two corners, and the price of soybean cake continued to rise by a few points. Therefore, the soybean price rose again by four or five points, but the oil mills, seeing that the price continued to rise, inevitably reduced their appetite for hoarding. Therefore, the rise in yesterday's market was slight. Yesterday, a total of seven carts of beans from Siping Street, 3,000 bags of Za beans from Hankou, and 1,500 bags of Anqing beans were traded. The remaining beans were handled by this street for 700 to 800 bags.</p>

<p>Ke Xian rice has been arriving in a steady stream recently. The daily arrivals have been as many as 10,000 bags or more, especially the arrivals from Hankou, Shashi, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Yesterday, all goods rose unanimously, and flour and wheat also saw a sharp rise of one corner and two corners. The rice price should have followed, but the arrivals were strong, and the Cantonese sales stopped, so the market was flat and soft. A total of 2,700 bags of Jiangxi rice, 127 bags of Xiang rice, and 753 bags of Yongwen rice were traded throughout the day, all of which were distributed by this street and Shantou. The market conditions were mostly similar to the previous market, but some were softer due to the suspension of Cantonese sales.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Why is So Much Grain Transported North? About 60,000 Bags in Just Three Days <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>In the past two days, the number of rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains transported from this city to North China has been considerable. The amount of flour is over one million bags, and the amount of rice is also over 150,000. Recently, it was heard that the market price in Tianjin and Yantai was slightly tired, but the exports from this city are still strong. Yesterday, the Yuping ship went to Tianjin, fully loaded with more than 25,000 bags of white rice. The Dingsheng ship, which exported this morning, also loaded more than 20,000 bags to Tianjin. A certain British ship, which will be exported tomorrow, also has 8,000 to 9,000 bags, which are being loaded today. In previous years, except for Ke Xian rice, very little Su Geng rice was transported to the north. However, in the past year, the transportation has been continuous. What is the purpose of this? It has not been revealed until now.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Bo Dao Sales Rely Solely on the North; Tianjin Merchants are the Main Force; The Purchases are all High-Quality Products <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various merchants were slightly less than before, with a total of over eighty merchants, a total of 16,700 to 16,800 stones. Bo Dao still accounted for the majority. Fortunately, the purchasing power was still not weak. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao purchased over 6,000 bags of Bo Dao and 400 to 500 bags of Hou Geng. Retail sales still felt flat, so the market conditions did not fail to be stable. However, this time the purchasing power was dominated by Tianjin merchants, so they selected high-quality products for Bo Dao. As for the middle-grade goods, they were hesitant. As a result, the market conditions were that the high-quality goods were firm with a tight tone, the middle-grade market was flat with a soft undertone, the Hou Geng had little progress, the Du Jian still had a tired look, the Yang Jian goods were scarce and stable, and the Yin Yuan was also flat and correct. To predict the future trend, it still depends on the smoothness of purchasing power and the amount of source arrival.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various merchants in Hexia were forty-three merchants. The market merchants with quick selection made some purchases. The price of white Geng in the early market was soft by three or four points, and the evening market was firm. The arrival of Bo Dao was limited. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, and Dalian continued to purchase. The appetite of this street was still acceptable, and the price was firm. The price of Yang Jian was firm by two or three points, the price of Bu Gan Jian was firm, and the Yin Bian Yuan was peaceful. The rest of the rice was similar to before.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Yarn: Eight Yuan Achieved in One Go; Futures Yarn Suspended; --The Reason is-- Decline of Five Years, Things Must Return; Shortened Period, More Crazy Speculation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Until the Later Market, Both Sides were Deadlocked and Had Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>The yarn market rose wildly, with unstoppable momentum. The reason is that there is a strange shortage of spot yarn, and the buyer's appetite is quite strong. Therefore, the buying wind was set off, and new speculators rushed in, buying fiercely, with a strong absorption. The general floating air, seeing the bad environment, cut off without limiting the price, bearing the pain. Therefore, the market price soared, and the prices of each month were consistently suspended due to the rise. In the afternoon, they were still deadlocked and could not open a transaction. This kind of scene has never been seen since the exchange opened.</p>
<p>Unstoppable Buying Wind</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn in the previous market, each month rose sharply consistently. The reason is that the spot yarn sales market is still lively, and the factory's spot goods are out of stock. Therefore, the shorts were panicked, and the buyers came like a tide. The market opened step by step and jumped. The three transactions showed a slight setback. On the closing platform, only buying was heard, and very little selling. Each month jumped again, reaching the level of suspension. This kind of violent situation has been rare in the past five years. People's hearts are panic-stricken to the extreme. Checking the reasons, half is because the yarn market has been declining, so it has been five years. Things must return, the law of nature. Second, recently speculators have concentrated on the yarn and cotton market. The standard yarn period has been shortened, with only four months remaining. Once there is good news, the rising momentum is even more difficult to curb. As a result, each month rose by eight yuan to eight and a half yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon was extended to 3:30 pm to open, and the long and short sides held different opinions. As a result, all of them could not open. However, the market situation was still chaotic. It is said that there are still some people doing things on the buying side. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,000 packages, Tongfu 2,250 packages, Hengyi 3,450 packages, Juxing 2,850 packages, Yiji 2,400 packages, Yuanda 1,150 packages, Gengfeng 2,600 packages, Ruida 2,150 packages, Shenji 4,100 packages, Taichang 1,550 packages, Changfeng 8,000 packages, Runkang 2,000 packages, Yongda 2,200 packages, and Tonghe 1,800 packages. The purchases were Yuda 5,250 packages, Jinchang 2,000 packages, Daqing 1,150 packages, Hexing 12,300 packages, Changji 1,250 packages, Shenchang 1,250 packages, Changxing 1,800 packages, Renfeng 2,800 packages, Yida 1,600 packages, Dachangcheng 4,250 packages, Xiesheng 1,500 packages, Fukang 1,700 packages, and Xincheng 1,700 packages.

<p>Over a Thousand Packages of Spot Yarn Were Traded</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that various merchants bought a total of 1,077 packages throughout the day. The selling price rose by 4.5 yuan. The purchase amounts of various merchants are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 500 Nanjing 10 Xuzhou 1</p>
<p>Changsha 80 Guangdong 80 Sichuan 320</p>
<p>Hankou 50 Jiangxi 10 Fellow Merchants 25</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Price Difference Between Cotton Yarn is Too Far; Cotton was Also Excited for a While; After All, There is Caution in Mind Due to the Harvest; The Later Market Has Long Liquidation <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market turned up because the yarn market was soaring step by step, and the rise has reached the suspension, and the enthusiasm of people's hearts is rare in recent times, resulting in the cotton market, which is dependent on each other, to introduce a good situation. In fact, the price difference between cotton yarn is too far, so it is easy to cause multiple activities at the same time, and the spot cotton sales market is active.</p>
<p>Market Price Rose by One Yuan and Thirty-Five Cents</p>
<p>In the previous market of standard cotton, after the opening, the buying interest was slightly strong due to the continued rise in the yarn market, and each month rose by five or six corners. After the second market, it was still calm. However, most people's psychology is that the production is smooth, so they are bearish on the cotton market. Until the close, because the yarn market rose to the suspension level, people's hearts were agitated, and the price difference between cotton yarn was too far, causing a part to buy in. As a result, each month rose by one yuan to one yuan and four corners compared to the previous day's closing price. After the market opened in the afternoon, the buyers were more numerous because the yarn market was suspended, and the market was tighter. However, some of the longs liquidated, and the momentum of the second transaction was slightly flat. As a result, the near month rose by 1.2 corners compared to the closing price in the morning, and the distant month did not move. It was found that Dachangcheng sold 4,100 piculs, Tonghe 4,500 piculs, Tongji 7,900 piculs, Tongfu 2,600 piculs, Chengji 2,500 piculs, Shengyuan 3,200 piculs, Hengyi 4,100 piculs, Ju 4,500 piculs, Jinchang 2,700 piculs, Mingde 5,200 piculs, Ruida 4,600 piculs, Taichang 14,000 piculs, Runkang 3,400 piculs, Fukang 5,500 piculs, Yichang 5,600 piculs, Fengtai 2,000 piculs, and Yicheng 4,500 piculs. The purchases were Changhe 40,300 piculs, Jifeng 3,700 piculs, Yuda 3,700 piculs, Changyu 5,000 piculs, Daqing 2,600 piculs, Wang Taixing 7,400 piculs, Xiesheng 2,900 piculs, Xincheng 3,400 piculs, Xinhua 5,400 piculs, Yikang 7,600 piculs, Taixing 2,100 piculs, Shenji 5,300 piculs, Xiesheng 2,500 piculs. The market prices are compared in the following.</p>
<p>Factory Needs are Active, and Sales are Also Moving</p>
<p>The spot cotton consumption is launched, because the yarn market is rising, the factory needs are active, and the sources are 810 bales of Yao flower and 680 bales of Tong flower.</p>

<p>Standard yarn and cotton markets of Chinese yarn and cloth trading have been rising violently recently, so the stock exchange, in order to be safe, has decided that the new transactions made for December standard yarn will add a special margin of 8 yuan per package from the 1st, plus the previous 16 yuan, and December standard cotton will add a special margin of 3 yuan per dan, plus the previous 6 yuan, and the money is deposited in both accounts. According to market news today, standard yarn has a sharp increase and declares suspension. In the afternoon, there is still a stalemate and it has not been able to open. This serious situation is unheard of since the opening of the exchange. It is said that there are a lot of people in it, and the future situation is unpredictable. Probably from today (December 2), the special margin for cotton yarn will be increased by 16 yuan per package, and 6 yuan per dan for standard cotton, and the money is deposited in both accounts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening price of US cotton rose by four to nine pounds, and the short positions were covered in the near month. January and March were brought up by the buying of the December period by brokers and foreign merchants. The increase in hedging sales and long liquidation, and a part of the reaction, turned the market situation quiet before the close, and there were slight off-market transactions. The spot cotton market is quiet and firm, and the cloth market is more sluggish. At the close, the same industry bought the near month, and it was quite beautiful. It is estimated that spot goods rose by seven pounds, and futures rose by nine pounds to a drop of three pounds. British cotton spot goods rose by six points, futures rose by three or four points. Indian cotton exporters bought slightly, and were overturned by hedging sales. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomura fell by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.25 rupees.

<p>Although the price of pure gold in Yu City fell yesterday, the market was still stable due to the arrival of large households. Later, it gradually became tired because the buyers were satisfied. The market situation was extremely flat throughout the day, and the transactions were all limited to the market. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was shrinking in the UK and flat in the US.

Qingfa, Yongfu, and Taiheng took advantage of the low level to need, which caused retail investors to come in. The morning opened flat. After opening, the large households asked for supply, but they were all limited to the market. Therefore, they struggled greatly. The listing of HSBC Bank was announced, and the UK and the US were both flat, and the silver balance tax shrunk by 0.25, lacking change.

<p>The morning opening was 1155.4 yuan, the same price as the previous close. Although Dadecheng and Dafengheng sold, Qingfa and Yongyi were advanced, rising to 5.5 yuan. Qiafengyong and others were still selling, but it was difficult to rise again. The HSBC Bank's listing was announced, and the UK and the US were both flat, and the silver balance tax shrunk by 0.25.

<h3 id="e129">Securities and Bond Market: Morale is Weary and Incapable. Rumors of New Large Short Positions Appear. Result: Drop of Five to Six Jiao <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange and the government bond market continued to decline. Market conditions became increasingly sluggish. With the situation on the Sui frontier chaotic, morale was weary and incapable. Large bullish investors were selling off eagerly. Rumors spread that a certain large investor was taking a large short position by selling off large quantities of stock, which made market prices and sentiment weak. The selling trend was vigorous, and prices continued to fall. However, as retail investors gradually covered their short positions, the market situation stabilized slightly in the latter part of the day. However, the brewing situation and the bewildering nature of the on-stage situation indicate that drastic changes are still to come. The market's trajectory yesterday showed a clear inability to recover. However, at the beginning of the morning session, retail investors were eager to buy, and the "10.3" bond was also heavily purchased, causing market prices to rebound slightly by five fen to five jiao. However, in the second session, large investors such as "55.18.11" and "4" all sold off or released large quantities of stock. In particular, "45" sold huge amounts at every price point, causing a unified and sharp drop of 10 to 70 jiao. The afternoon session opened with a continuing downward trend, and morale was also bewildered and uncertain. "45.11.35" and other entities continued to offer a large number of chips, while "10.43.31" and others bought in quite a bit, causing market prices to fall again by a uniform small amount of five fen to six and a half jiao.

<h3 id="e131">Chiang Fang-chen and Wang Peng-sheng Returned to China on the Same Ship Yesterday, Arriving in Shanghai. Chiang Spoke of a World War Not Likely to Occur Soon, While Wang Said He Was Taking a Month's Leave to Attend to Private Matters. <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Chiang Fang-chen</p>
<p>Mr. Chiang Fang-chen, who was previously ordered to go abroad to inspect military affairs, returned to China on the Japanese Empress ship of the Changxing Company at 2:30 PM yesterday, arriving in Shanghai. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Those who went to welcome him included Mr. Li Dachao, representative of Mayor Wu, Legislator Jian Youwen, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Zhu Changnian, Director Zhou Jue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and Xue Dubi, Xu Xinliu, Yao Xijiu, and many others. After Mr. Chiang disembarked, he went directly to his private residence on Guofumen Road to rest. Mr. Chiang said when he met with reporters on the ship yesterday that he had visited Rome, Vienna, Berlin, Prague, London, New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Tokyo, and had also observed the autumn exercises of Italy and Czechoslovakia. He originally planned to visit the Soviet Union on the way back, but he did not make the trip due to lack of time. In the past, people generally believed that the Blackshirts of Italy and the National Socialist Party of Germany adhered to the same doctrine. According to my investigation, the former's nature is cooperation, while the latter's nature is exclusion. The two are actually very different. As for the reason why Italy and Germany are close, it is based on mutual interests, just like the closeness between France and Russia. The current situation in Europe is extremely chaotic, so some people are worried that a second world war is about to break out. However, according to my observation, a world war will absolutely not occur, because the current disputes between countries are all trivial matters and there are no vital interests at stake.</p>
<p>Wang Peng-sheng</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Peng-sheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, has requested leave to return to China to attend to matters and report on embassy affairs to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese Empress ship at 2:30 PM yesterday. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Director Zhou Jue of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office and Huang Bodu, Secretary of the Embassy in Japan, went to the port to welcome him. After Mr. Wang disembarked, he went to his residence to rest. He is scheduled to go to Beijing today to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang. According to Mr. Wang, speaking to the Central News Agency on the ship, he has been away from the country for a long time and has private matters at home that need to be handled, so he has requested leave to return to China and to report on embassy affairs to Foreign Minister Zhang on behalf of Ambassador Xu. Ambassador Xu originally planned to request leave to return to China, but he was unable to find the time due to the busy embassy affairs, so the date has not yet been determined. My vacation this time is for one month. After meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang, I will also meet with President Jiang and wait for instructions before determining the itinerary. Mr. Wang did not make detailed comments on the signing of the Japan-Germany Agreement and the recent negotiations between Japan and Italy, only saying that the embassy in Japan had heard of the Japan-Germany Agreement before it was signed and reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As for the content of the agreement, in addition to the officially announced content, the various rumors circulating are difficult to verify. Negotiations between Japan and Italy are ongoing, and it is difficult to say what the content will be. As for the future of Sino-Japanese negotiations, it depends on the attitude of the Japanese side.</p>

<p>Mr. Hu Qing-yu, the specialist sent by our country to the League of Nations to investigate administrative organization, set off abroad on the Soviet merchant ship "Northern" at 3:00 PM yesterday. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 5:00 AM this morning. At the same time, Guo Zefen, the new Consul to Moscow, is also on board. Mr. Hu is traveling to Vladivostok, where he will transfer to the Siberian Railway train and travel directly to Switzerland via the Soviet Union, Poland, and Germany, without stopping along the way, because he must arrive in Geneva before January 1 (i.e., New Year's Day) in accordance with the instructions of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. The investigation period is six months, and he will return to China next summer. Zhang Fu-liang of the Jiangxi Agricultural Experiment Station, who is also investigating cooperative enterprises, is also scheduled to depart on the German postal ship "Scharnhorst" on the 23rd of this month. As for Xu Kai, chief engineer of the Huai River Conservancy Committee, who is investigating water conservancy construction, the departure date has not yet been determined.</p>

He expressed his gratitude for the presence of guests from various countries. He then raised his glass in celebration, and the ceremony ended.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Ministry of Railways' Materials Purchase Promissory Notes Were Issued Yesterday, with an Annual Interest Rate of 7%, Guaranteed by a Banking Consortium for Payment and Discount. Domestic Material Suppliers Are Willing to Accept and Promote Them. <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, in order to promote railway construction, encourage the production of domestic railway materials, and centralize purchases, the Ministry of Railways began issuing materials purchase promissory notes yesterday. To increase the credibility of the promissory notes, it was agreed that a banking consortium consisting of the Central Trust Bureau, and the Shanghai, Jincheng, Zhejiang Industrial, and Zhongnan banks would guarantee payment and handle discounts. The conditions are as follows: (1) The term of the promissory notes is one year from the date of issuance, with repayment due on the same day of the following year, plus interest at an annual rate of 7%. (2) The promissory notes will be issued over a period of twelve months. (3) The consortium will designate the Central Trust Bureau as its representative to endorse the promissory notes and guarantee payment on schedule. (4) The Ministry of Railways will entrust the Central Trust Bureau to accept the promissory notes when they mature and are due for payment of principal and interest. (5) The promissory notes will be made out to the payee and, before maturity, may be discounted or rediscounted by the holder or his assignee with the consortium's representative (Central Trust Bureau). The interest rate will be negotiated at any time. Therefore, the creditworthiness of the promissory notes is extremely reliable, and they will be freely circulated in the market in the future. Not only will the Ministry of Railways be able to purchase materials in large quantities based on its income and make successive orders from domestic merchants to implement various construction projects, but also domestic material suppliers and the banking consortium will receive considerable benefits. For the banking consortium, they can handle discounts and rediscounts at any time and use their funds. For the material suppliers, they can sell more materials. Although the purchase price is not in cash, they can discount the notes with the bank at any time before maturity. Therefore, domestic material suppliers are willing to accept and promote these promissory notes as much as possible to assist the government in building railways.</p>

<p>Xie Zuomin Discusses Promoting Overseas Chinese Affairs, Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Invest in China, and Focusing on Implementation Matters in the Future</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Xie Zuomin, member of the Central Committee and newly appointed Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office in Guangzhou, arrived in Shanghai on the 30th from Nanjing to await passage south to take up his new post. Regarding the current situation of overseas Chinese affairs in Guangdong and the policies to be implemented in the future, Mr. Xie told a Central News Agency reporter as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of Overseas Chinese from Guangdong</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese from Guangdong have footprints all over the world. Not only are the economies of Guangzhou, Zhaoqing, Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Hainan largely dependent on remittances from overseas Chinese, but the economic construction and education of the entire Guangdong province also rely on the resources of overseas Chinese. In recent years, the political and construction progress in Guangdong has been slow. Furthermore, due to the impact of the recession felt by overseas Chinese, the flow of overseas resources has sharply decreased, and the hardships of the people have increased. This shows that the businesses of overseas Chinese from Guangdong have a significant impact on the livelihoods of the people in the province.</p>
<p>Encouraging Investment in China</p>
<p>Although overseas Chinese are in an environment of economic collapse, their foundations are solid and their economic strength can still be utilized. Therefore, the number of overseas Chinese returning to invest in China has not decreased compared to the past, and has even increased. Due to the changing situation of doing business abroad, overseas Chinese should be encouraged to invest in China. As for the capital that overseas Chinese move to China, the active capital overseas will be a problem that we must address, and we must plan and cultivate it. The method of cultivating resources should not only focus on managing individual assets from a positive perspective. We should guide overseas Chinese to mutually support all social organizations and adhere to the principles of modern economics.</p>
<p>Promoting Overseas Chinese Affairs in Guangdong</p>
<p>The situation of overseas Chinese abroad and the areas that should be focused on now have been described above. As for the promotion of overseas Chinese affairs in Guangdong in the future, based on my inspection in Guangdong last month, I believe that the following matters should be implemented: (1) "Guidance for Overseas Chinese Organizations": All social organizations should seek the welfare of the public. There are many overseas Chinese organizations in Guangdong. In order to promote the welfare of overseas Chinese, it is necessary to strengthen their forces and improve their organizations. Therefore, they should be rewarded or corrected and guided and assisted accordingly. (2) "Protecting Overseas Chinese Entering and Leaving the Country": Everyone knows the drawbacks of overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country. In the future, attention should be paid to improving passport issuance and visa procedures, investigating and requesting the abolition or modification of harsh regulations promulgated by governments in various places of residence, and preventing fraud in going abroad. (Regarding entry, we should fulfill our responsibility of guidance and protection, such as consulting with the customs to implement preferential measures for overseas Chinese entering the country, and notifying local officials in the hometowns of returning overseas Chinese to provide effective protection.) (3) "Guiding Overseas Chinese Children Returning to China for Education": The level of Chinese language proficiency of overseas Chinese children is generally low, which often affects their determination to return to China for further education. In the future, educational institutions at the provincial and municipal levels should be consulted to request the establishment of special classes to improve their Chinese language proficiency. (4) "Promoting Overseas Chinese Economic Organizations": The economic organizations of overseas Chinese must not remain scattered. Recognizing the modern economic environment and instilling economic knowledge are necessary. In particular, planned cooperation should be promoted, and experts should be hired to conduct research. (5) "Encouraging Overseas Chinese Investment": In the past, overseas Chinese often encountered obstacles and had no channels for investing in China. Therefore, in the future, relevant construction departments in the province should be consulted to investigate the needs of various places and the amount of capital required for businesses to be established in a certain place, and plans should be formulated at any time and announced to overseas Chinese through various means to encourage investment. (6) "Effective Relief for Unemployed Returning Overseas Chinese": In the past, unemployed overseas Chinese who returned to China were given travel expenses to return to their hometowns, but overseas Chinese have different living habits and work experience after being abroad for many years. After returning to their hometowns, they are still displaced and helpless. Therefore, giving money to return to their hometowns can only be a temporary measure and is not a fundamental solution. In the future, overseas Chinese investment projects should be used to accommodate unemployed returning overseas Chinese, and so on.</p>

<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, Mr. Yoshida Seiji, Chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Mitsubishi Bank, left Shanghai last month to return to Japan to attend the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry meeting. Having completed his mission, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the Japanese mail ship "Shanghai Maru." According to rumors in business circles, Yoshida's trip to Japan was originally to request the Japanese authorities and influential figures in industry and commerce to proceed with Sino-Japanese credit loans in order to dump Japan's surplus goods. However, most prudent Japanese capitalists are adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to tense Sino-Japanese relations and the lack of guaranteed prospects, so the mission was unsuccessful, and Yoshida returned crestfallen.</p>

<p>The Third Tian (Reclaimed) Land Bureau of the Jiangsu Provincial Government recently received instructions from the provincial capital to extend the deadline for another three months for all Tian (Reclaimed) Land cases where land was leased before the 18th year of the Republic but not yet enclosed and developed, with compensation collected at half price. The announcement is recorded as follows: Jiangsu Province First Tian (Reclaimed) Land Bureau Announcement Sha Zi No. 2. Re: instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, Sha Zi No. 20707, regarding this Bureau's submission on October 19th of the 25th year of the Republic for a half-price collection of compensation, proposing to extend the deadline for another three months to facilitate collection, requesting approval, which stated: "Noted. Regarding the proposal to extend the half-price collection of compensation for another three months to facilitate collection, etc., approval is granted to show consideration. In addition to forwarding to the First and Second Tian (Reclaimed) Land Bureaus and the counties of Ganyu, Yutai, Donghai, and Guanyun for unified compliance, you are to post a notice to inform all landholders and state on the notice that 'no further extensions will be granted' as a restriction. The draft of the notice and the start and end dates of the extension must be submitted to the Department for record and compliance. This order." Upon receipt of this, this Bureau notes that the previous extension of the deadline for half-price compensation coincided with the autumn harvest season in rural areas, preventing the preferential policy from reaching all households. Now that the autumn harvest has ended, and farmers are actively paying compensation, a request has been submitted to extend the deadline for three months to facilitate collection. In accordance with the aforementioned instructions, in addition to reporting and sending separate letters of instruction, it is imperative to post a notice to inform all: For all Tian (Reclaimed) Land cases where land was leased before May of the 18th year of the Republic but not yet enclosed and developed, half-price collection of land prices will still be permitted if payment is made before January 26th of the 26th year of the Republic. No further extensions will be granted. This matter is an exceptional act of consideration. It is essential not to delay or misunderstand. This notice is hereby issued on November 30th of the 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

He will stay for a while and then return to Shanghai, and will not return north for the time being. It is said that the ambassador's trip to Beijing the night before last was to transfer north, but this is not a confirmed statement.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Joint Winter Defense Begins in Military and Police Agencies in This City <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The military and police agencies in this city routinely hold joint winter defense at the end of each year. However, due to the recent invasion of Suiyuan by bandits and puppet troops, it is being implemented earlier this year. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has begun inspections by land and water, and neighboring counties are conducting joint defense. Due to the sufficient local security in this city, kidnapping and theft cases have decreased compared to previous years. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Winter Defense Begins: In previous years, the winter defense period was scheduled to be held at the end of December. This year, it is the time of tension in Suiyuan border bandit suppression. It is feared that unscrupulous people will take the opportunity to spread rumors and disrupt local peace. Therefore, the military and police units, such as the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Command, the Security Regiment, the Public Security Bureau, and the Security Committee, have planned to implement it earlier. The respective agencies have ordered their subordinates to follow the winter defense measures of previous years and begin winter defense.</p>
<p>Land and Water Inspections: The Municipal Public Security Bureau has ordered the police stations in each district to pay attention to inspecting suspicious pedestrians at any time. Since the flow of ships on waterways is more frequent, and it is easier for bandits to hide and traffic in illegal goods, special attention is paid to inspections. It is reported that the water patrol team has issued an order to its subordinate units to step up inspections of ships traveling to and from the Huangpu River, Suzhou Creek, and Wusong area. If anyone is found to be suspicious, they will be detained immediately.</p>
<p>Joint Defense in Neighboring Counties: The neighboring counties of Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Jiading, Songjiang, etc., in the suburbs of Shanghai, are jointly conducting winter defense with Shanghai to achieve better coordination of security forces. The method is that if a robbery or theft occurs at the junction of the city and the county, they will jointly investigate. If the crime scene belongs to Shanghai and the criminals are apprehended in the neighboring county, the case will be handled by Shanghai.</p>
<p>Decrease in Theft Cases: A reporter from the Dagong News Agency inquired with the competent authorities yesterday and learned that this year, due to the coordinated efforts of local security forces, the people are living in peace. The number of theft cases in the urban area has decreased by eight-tenths compared to last year. It is inevitable that poor and helpless people will take risks in the cold winter, but the police authorities have notified charitable organizations to provide as much relief and shelter as possible. In addition, with sufficient security, criminals have no way to succeed.</p>

<p>Okawa, the newly appointed commander of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Force in Shanghai, paid a special visit to Commander Yang Xiaotian of the Songhu Garrison Command at 9:50 AM yesterday, accompanied by staff officers Esaka and Tada. Commander Yang received them along with Zhou Jue, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Secretary Sun Lyping. An honor guard was dispatched to welcome them. They talked for twenty minutes, and then Okawa said goodbye. Commander Yang is scheduled to return the visit tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Continued Interception of Rice Boats; Qingpu and Yushan Permitted to Pass <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The two counties of Pingyang and Yueqing in Zhejiang Province have also experienced the detention of rice boats leaving the province. The Shanghai Grain and Cereal Association has sent a letter to the local association, requesting that they telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government for their release. The original letter states: Respected Sirs, Previously, due to the prohibition of grain leaving Jiangsu and Zhejiang, this association submitted a letter to your association, which was presented to Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, who replied that the prohibition of the export of food grains was purely to prevent leakage to the sea. If the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has official proof, it can be transported. The city Chamber of Commerce handled the proof procedures, and at the same time, this association informed our colleagues that when purchasing and transporting food from Zhejiang Province, they must report to this association for verification and apply to the city Chamber of Commerce for a certificate, and at the same time, inform your association to report to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for record. Subsequently, at the 289th executive meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 24th of last month, it was resolved that food grains should be allowed to circulate freely, and the measures proposed by various provinces and cities to restrict the export of food grains were not in line with economic principles and the central government's overall management of food grains. Therefore, it seems that the counties of Zhejiang Province should no longer prevent export and should no longer use transportation permits or passports. However, it has recently been reported by the Jingtouzhen Rice Industry Association of Pingyang County that your colleagues Yu De, Qianfeng, and Weiyiheng sent partners here with a certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to purchase and transport 10,000 bags of rice, but they were suddenly intercepted by the county government, detained and unable to leave. It is feared that the rice will become moldy. Please telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to quickly order the Pingyang County Government to issue transportation permits so that they can be shipped, and Da Cheng and other colleagues have stated that the Yueqing County Government is in the same situation. Therefore, a letter has been prepared and sent to you. It is hoped that your association will investigate and telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to quickly order the Pingyang and Yueqing County Governments to comply with the central government's resolutions, release the intercepted rice, and not obstruct transportation in the future, in order to comply with laws and regulations and benefit circulation. This is a matter of public interest. Respectfully addressed to Shanghai Local Association, Shanghai Grain, Cereal, Oil Cake Industry Association.</p>
<p>Jiading also Detains: A Large Number of Rice Boats</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM yesterday, a large number of more than 30 rice boats, which had been transported from Changshu to Shanghai for sale at the Xinzha Bridge in the northern part of the city, were suddenly intercepted by the police dispatched by the Jiading County Public Security Bureau near Wangmiao Temple in Jiading County and were not allowed to pass. The boat merchants sent representatives to Shanghai last night to report the detention to the North City Rice Store, the Hubei Rice Transportation Merchants Lianyi Association, and the Changshu Association, requesting negotiations. After discussing the solution last night, the association sent representatives to the Jiading County Government this morning to request their release.</p>
<p>Qingpu and Jinshan: Rice and Grain Allowed to Pass</p>
<p>More than 40 rice boats detained in Qingpu and Yushan counties in Jiangsu Province were released after various parties telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the county chambers of commerce and rice industry groups negotiated. The detained rice will be temporarily stored in the stores, and will be released after the provincial order. The rice and grain currently being transported through the border will be allowed to circulate as usual and will no longer be detained.</p>

<p>The Clearing House affiliated to the Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association has achieved great results since its establishment on January 10, 1933. Both the silver and money industries have benefited greatly. Currently, there are 44 clearing banks, including those represented by the association, such as Bank of Communications. There are a total of 85 branch banks in this city represented by their head offices. As for those represented by the association: (A) Zhejiang Local Bank, (B) Sichuan Meifeng Bank, (C) Jiangsu Farmers Bank, (D) China Farmers Bank (formally joined as the 41st clearing bank yesterday), (E) Yongda Bank, (F) Pucheng Bank, (G) Agricultural and Commercial Bank, (H) Chuan Kang Bank. In addition, it also collects money industry and non-clearing bank bills. The total daily clearing amount has gradually increased, for example, it was 13,154,329.96 yuan the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Tax on Re-Export of Miscellaneous Grains and Peanuts: Two-Year Extension of Exemption; Miscellaneous Grain Industry Submits Document to the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration for a two-year extension of the exemption from the re-export tax on miscellaneous grains, peanuts, peanut oil, and peanut kernels. The original submission stated: It was previously investigated that the Jiaohai Customs was ordered to exempt the re-export tax on domestically transported peanuts and native products for two years starting from April 21 of the previous year. The association's colleagues Shen Shouting and Yuan Tang carefully observed that the peanuts operated in Shanghai are mostly from Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. If re-export tax is exempted, the products from the above-mentioned places will be transported to Haizhou by the Longhai Railway for export, transferring to Qingdao, Shanghai will be greatly affected. It is requested that the association send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, earnestly requesting the Ministry (your department) to follow the precedent of Qingdao and grant a unified exemption. In response, the (Customs Administration) (your department) approved on November 22 of the 23rd year that what was said was indeed true. It has been reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval, and it has been specially approved to exempt the re-export tax on peanuts, peanut kernels, and peanut oil transported from Shanghai to various domestic ports. In addition to ordering the General Tax Office to transfer the order to the Jianghai Customs for compliance, the starting date of the exemption should be reported for record. This approval, and on December 3 of the same year, the Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tax Office jointly issued Announcement No. 1405, stating that the re-export tax on the aforementioned goods will be exempted for two years from November 29 of this year. Merchants should be notified, etc., on record. It is now investigated that the exemption period for the re-export tax on peanuts, peanut oil, and peanut kernels transported from Qingdao to China will expire on April 21 of this year, and the Ministry (Ministry of Finance) has approved a two-year extension. The exemption period for the re-export tax on peanuts, peanut oil, and peanut kernels transported from Shanghai to China will also expire on November 29 of this year. Jianghai Customs will restore taxation on the re-export of the aforementioned goods. The association believes that the situation in Qingdao and Shanghai is the same. The extension of the tax exemption needs to be followed as a precedent. A document is specially prepared and submitted to your department for review and transfer (Ministry of Finance for review) and still follows the precedent of Qingdao, granting a two-year extension of the tax exemption to benefit commerce. We are eagerly awaiting orders. Respectfully presented to Minister of Finance Kong and Director of Customs Zheng Lai.</p>

<p>At 12:20 PM yesterday, a fashionable young woman was riding in a chartered car on Route Lafayette near Rue Constant in the French Concession, traveling from east to west. Suddenly, two robbers riding bicycles came rushing past the left side of the chartered car and snatched the handbag from the young woman's hand in the car. One of the robbers took out a pistol and threatened her, forcing the driver of the chartered car to flee into a nearby store. Unexpectedly, two Russians happened to be on the side of the road at the time and witnessed the woman being robbed. They immediately bravely ran across the road to chase the two robbers. One of the Russians knocked down one of the robbers' bicycles, but the robber turned around and fired two shots. One bullet hit the Russian in the neck, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The other bullet grazed the hair of the second Russian, but fortunately, he was not injured. The two robbers were able to calmly get on their bicycles and escape towards Route Lallemand. The robbed woman and the driver of the chartered car also left without a trace. After the nearby police arrived and reported to the police station, the captain immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. It was learned that the Russian who was shot and killed was named Li Amini, 36 years old, formerly worked at the British-owned Water Company, and currently works at the Church on Avenue Joffre. The body was immediately transported to the Westerner's morgue on Route Trolard to await examination. The other Russian's name is Fei Yinaosi. The police are currently strictly hunting down the perpetrators and hope that the young woman and the driver of the chartered car who were robbed at the time will quickly turn themselves in to the police station and describe the situation at the time to facilitate the police's investigation. The victim of the robbery has no responsibility for this case.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Avoiding a Repeat of Last Winter's Dagu Ice Navigation Calamity: Customs Sets Sailing Procedures, Specifies Lightship Equipment and Ice Signals, Effective December 1st <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>To ensure safe passage for ships sailing the North China route, as winter approaches and the river is about to freeze, and in light of the ice-bound conditions at Dagu last winter, the Customs has specially set forth winter sailing procedures to avoid a repeat of last year's disaster. These procedures took effect yesterday (December 1st) and are recorded below:</p>
<p>Lightship Equipment</p>
<p>Around December 1st this year, the Dagu Lightship will be withdrawn. However, during the winter period, the winter lightship "Haiming" will be stationed in its original location as a replacement. This lightship will display a black ball during the day, and at night, it will use a white quick-flashing light that flashes once every twelve seconds (i.e., bright for one and a half seconds, off for ten and a half seconds). In clear weather, it can be seen within a radius of 18.52 kilometers (10 nautical miles). If the "Haiming" lightship's lighting equipment malfunctions, the ship will use its searchlight as a substitute, flashing it towards the sea every ten seconds. Once the equipment is repaired, it will return to its original state. In dull weather or heavy fog, if approaching ships can hear it, it will strike the gong once every minute. In inclement weather, the ship may move away and return to its original location when the weather improves. When necessary, it may also leave its original location during the day to take on supplies. However, if the weather is good at that time, the Customs transport vessel "Tianshun" will be dispatched as a substitute. The "Tianshun" transport vessel will display a black ball on its foremast, its hull is white, and its smokestack is light yellow. The "Haiming" lightship's smokestack remains white for identification purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Municipal Federation Issues Letters of Negotiation: Interest Should Be Paid on Electricity and Water Deposits <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The First Special District Municipal Federation yesterday issued letters to the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Waterworks Company, stating, "Regarding the commercial practice in this city of paying interest on deposits and guarantees received from others, the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Waterworks Company collect deposits from users. If these deposits are mortgaged with the respective company's stocks, interest can still be collected according to the face value of the stocks upon maturity. However, most of the deposits paid by citizens are in cash, and their nature is the same as mortgages and credit. The income of each company from cash deposits is very large, but we have not seen each company paying interest, which is a deprivation and encroachment on the interests of others, and also violates legal principles. This matter was brought up for discussion at the meeting yesterday, and it was resolved to write to your association, requesting that you uphold justice and strive to negotiate with each company reasonably to protect the rights of citizens. We have recorded the case and request your investigation and prompt negotiation to safeguard the interests of citizens." It is believed that user deposits are originally for credit and guarantee purposes, and interest should be paid. Otherwise, the company will find it difficult to avoid the suspicion of encroaching on the interests of others. In view of the above, we hereby request your company to promptly stipulate a method for paying interest on deposits in order to demonstrate fairness and justice."</p>
<p>Ice Conditions</p>
<p>During the ice season, the icebreaker "Qingling" stationed in Dagu (radio call sign XNEI) will broadcast QST signals by radio at 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM daily (which can be received by all radio stations) on a wavelength of 600 meters, reporting on ice conditions at the Dagu estuary, the time and height of the last high tide, and all urgent news related to weather and navigation. However, ship captains should refrain from transmitting radio signals daily between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, and between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM, to avoid interfering with the icebreaker's communication with its supervisory authorities. If ships have any inquiries about ice conditions, they may contact the icebreaker by radio on a wavelength of 600 meters at 9:00 AM, 12:00 noon, 3:00 PM, and 6:00 PM daily, and they will be answered promptly. If the icebreaker leaves its original location and goes out to sea, someone should be on duty every hour to answer inquiries, but telegrams not related to ice conditions will not be answered. When ships arrive in Tianjin or Tanggu, the ship captains should immediately report the ice conditions encountered en route to the port authorities for reference and cooperation. Furthermore, ship captains should also use the following signals to inform passing ships of the ice conditions they have encountered along the way, so as to alert them:</p>
<p>Ice Signals</p>
<p>The applicable signals are listed below: (1) Signals for ice on the Dagu River: Signal: no ice; Signal 2: thin ice (navigation is still easy); Signal 1.3: thin ice (navigation will gradually become difficult); Signal 3: thick ice (navigation is difficult); Signal 3.2: thick ice (navigation is difficult, but there is a tendency to become easier); Signal 3.4: thick ice (navigation is difficult, but there is a tendency to become more difficult); Signal 4: thick ice (navigation is very difficult); Signal 4.3: thick ice (navigation is very difficult, but there is a tendency to become easier); Signal 4.5: solid ice (navigation is impossible). (2) Signals for ice in Bohai Bay: Signal 6: no ice; Signal 7: thin ice (navigation is still easy); Signal 7.8: thin ice (navigation is gradually becoming difficult); Signal 8: thick ice (navigation is difficult); Signal 8.7: thick ice (navigation is difficult, but there is a tendency to become easier); Signal 8.9: thick ice (navigation is difficult, but there is a tendency to become more difficult); Signal 9: thick ice (navigation is very difficult); Signal 9.8: thick ice (navigation is very difficult, but there is a tendency to become easier); Signal 9.10: solid ice (navigation is very difficult or may be impossible); Signal 10: solid ice (navigation is impossible).</p>

<p>The Evening Post reports that after the death of Shanghai businessman Hardoon, who left his entire estate to his wife, Rachel Hardoon, a relative of Hardoon's recently hired lawyers Harris and Fischmann to sue the widow in the British Supreme Court for China. The plaintiff claims that the deceased Hardoon was an Iraqi national, and according to Iraqi law, a widow may not receive more than one-quarter of the total value of the estate. The remaining assets should be divided among the deceased's relatives. The case was heard in court this morning (the 1st) by the Supreme Court. The defendant hired lawyers Puddefoot, Lighte, and Bardesley to defend her. The defendant's lawyers did not admit that the deceased was an Iraqi national, but only admitted that the deceased's father was born in Baghdad and that the deceased had legally become a British citizen. The plaintiff's lawyers refuted this, claiming that the deceased was only under British protection and was not a British citizen. After much debate, there was no result. The relationship between the plaintiff and the deceased was not clarified. The plaintiff only stated that he was entrusted by all the deceased's relatives to file the lawsuit in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Lin Jun, 38 years old, a native of Chuansha and the principal of Jingping Middle School on Father Lao Shen Road, and Jiusan Primary School on Fangjia Wooden Bridge in Zhabei, was recently sued by Shen Fuzhen, a female English teacher from Suzhou who was dismissed from Jingping Middle School, for the crime of seduction and disrupting public morals. After the court opened hearings several times, the plaintiff never appeared. Only the defendant's lawyer appeared in court and said that the case had been settled out of court and requested a postponement. The plaintiff then filed a request with the court to withdraw the lawsuit. The judge verified the bizarre circumstances of the case and ordered that the defendant and the lawyer who wrote the complaint on behalf of the plaintiff be summoned to court to clarify the situation. Yesterday, Sun Peng, a judge from the Special Second Court, continued the hearing in the first criminal court. The defendant Lin Jun, accompanied by his defense lawyer, and the lawyer You Zhi, who was commissioned by the plaintiff to write the complaint, appeared in court. You claimed that he was not in court as the plaintiff's agent, but as a witness. The lawyer had not been released from the plaintiff's commission. At first, Shen Fuzhen asked someone to represent her in commissioning the lawyer to handle the lawsuit. He then ordered Shen to come in person to confirm the commission. The next day, the representative said that Shen was ill in bed and presented a draft of the complaint written by Shen herself, with Shen's seal on it, and asked him to proceed with the lawsuit on her behalf. Later, the lawyer went with the representative to see Shen Fuzhen in person. Shen said, "Will I be able to not appear in court in the future?" The lawyer replied according to the law, "If the court summons you, you must appear in court, you cannot refuse." Shen then said that if she had to appear in court, she would not proceed with the lawsuit. Later, Shen filed a request to withdraw the lawsuit, which the lawyer did not know about. If the court needs to summon Shen in person for questioning, Shen lives at No. 24 Back Street, Zhouzhuang, Suzhou. He also presented Shen's handwritten draft complaint and a stamped power of attorney. After the court verified that the handwriting of the draft and the seal were consistent with the withdrawal request, it declared that the lawsuit would be allowed to be withdrawn and ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>

<p>A fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Chen Longxing cotton shop at No. 107 Anajin Road in Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession at around 11:40 PM last night. The fire quickly broke through the roof, and the strong northwest wind caused it to spread to the neighboring houses, including the upper floor of the Fuyuanyuan barbershop at No. 105, the upper floor of the Longxing restaurant at No. 103, and the upper floor of the Maoxinglong porridge shop at No. 101. Most of these houses were sublet to more than ten households, so everyone was caught off guard and scrambled to escape. A man in his eighties or nineties was pushed and fell, suffering skin abrasions. Fortunately, the French Concession Fire Brigade had received the alert early and rushed fire trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. It was extinguished at around 1:00 AM this morning. As a result, the upper floors of four houses were destroyed, and the losses were heavy. The arsonist fled after the fire started and is currently being pursued.</p>

<p>After members of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group, such as Tu Dongcai, were arrested by Chinese and Western detectives from the Lao Zha Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for sentencing, the internal organization and main members of the group were revealed.

The police station lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the only person the police station wanted to arrest was Wang Zixiang, who had not yet been apprehended. Jiang and Ren had been scheduled by the court to be tried on the 3rd of this month, so Wang Jingzhi should also be detained and tried together with Jiang Ren.

He stated that he was from Hangzhou and was currently working as a section chief in the General Affairs Department of the National Flag Manufacturing Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Li Mingde's Involvement with a Dancing Girl Creates Repeated Commotion: Wife Accuses Him of Adultery; Dancing Girl Accuses Him of Seduction <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Li Mingde, thirty years old, son of Li Hongfa, a comprador for the Osaka branch of the Japanese Mitsubishi Company, and a native of Ningbo, is already married to a Mrs. Cao. Because of his family's wealth, Li is a spoiled young man and currently a student at Guanghua University. Dance halls and theaters are naturally the places where modern young people seek entertainment, and Li Mingde is no exception. Therefore, in 1933, he met a local dancing girl, Miss Fan (nineteen years old this year). It was love at first sight, and they spent every evening together. Their mutual affection led to a romance, clinging to each other like glue, vowing eternal love. Li Mingde then advanced to seeking cohabitation, falsely claiming he was unmarried. Thus, in May 1934, they established a small family in the French Concession of Mucun Street, living as husband and wife. The crystallization of their love occurred in February 1935. Mrs Cao filed a private suit in the Criminal Court. When summoned for questioning, Li Mingde admitted to all the facts with Miss Fan, but claimed, "Our love is very deep. I believe Miss Fan would never sue me; she is completely being manipulated and instigated by her brother-in-law. But I swear I love her, even if I am sanctioned by law and imprisoned, I will always love her." His tone was as if, after the birth of their two little angels, their love for each other became even deeper. Therefore, Li Mingde even wrote a contract for Miss Fan, stating that if he abandoned her halfway, he would pay her 50,000 yuan in living expenses. Unexpectedly, their love affair was fraught with obstacles. Their secret was discovered by Li's wife, Mrs. Cao, who brought the lovebirds to court, accusing them of adultery. Later, through the intervention of relatives, Mrs. Cao softened her stance, considering the marital relationship, and withdrew the lawsuit. The relatives and Li Mingde himself thought that one husband and two wives would allow the family to enjoy the bliss forever. Unexpectedly, just as Mrs. Cao's commotion subsided, Miss Fan suddenly refused to be a minor concubine and hired a lawyer to accuse Li Mingde of using deceit to make her mistakenly believe they were married, and of seducing a woman under twenty years old. She asked the local court to facilitate this amorous affair. Miss Fan repeatedly stated in court that she no longer loved Li Mingde. The judge verified that Miss Fan was under the legal age of twenty and therefore could not file a private suit. He ruled that the private suit was inadmissible and transferred the case to the prosecutor's office for investigation. Prosecutor Mei Yinji interrogated them, and both parties repeated their previous statements. The prosecutor instructed Li Mingde to post bail and await public prosecution according to the law.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Detectives Discover Goods-Swindling Criminal During Hotel Inspection: Fraudulently Establishes Company to Swindle Silk, Pays with Checks and Flees, Apprentice's Panic Reveals Case <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Dai Ganrong from Hangzhou recently fraudulently established a cotton yarn and silk brokerage firm named "Xiechangxiang" at 4 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. He hired Xu Yongquan from Shaoxing as the accountant and Dai Changben from Taizhou as the apprentice. Around 9 AM on the 23rd of last month, Dai Ganrong went to Wanlong Silk Store at 10, Lane 360, Beijing Road, and selected twenty pieces of silk of various colors, worth 514 yuan, from the clerk, Chen Zubei from Shaoxing. He ordered them to be sent to Xiechangxiang for payment and hurried away. The silk store sent the apprentice, Wang Shourong, and a porter in a hired cart to deliver the goods in full.</p>
<p>Accountant Xu Yongquan paid apprentice Wang with a check from Zikang Bank on Tianjin Road, No. 114, dated the 27th, and Wang took it back to his boss, Wang Mingjiu. Wang Mingjiu ordered someone to cash the check at Zikang, but they were told that the check was a forgery and that they did not do business with Xiechangxiang, so it was returned. Silk store clerk Chen Zubei and apprentice Wang</p>
<p>rushed to Xiechangxiang to find Dai Ganrong, but the shop's</p>
<p>doors were tightly closed</p>
<p>and the place was empty. They realized it was a swindling scheme and reported it to the General Police Station for arrest. The detectives from the Jiaru Road Police Station, Shao Fan, Liang Muyang, Yang Xinzheng, Xu Yongyuan, and Dong Qingquan, together with Western detectives, inspected hotels along East Jiaxing Road around 8 PM the day before yesterday</p>
<p>for bandits</p>
<p>in hiding. At Room 57 in the Shangyuan Hotel, they found Dai Changben, the apprentice from Xiechangxiang. When he saw the Chinese and Western detectives, he panicked. When questioned, he stammered. In a leather suitcase, they found a package of the stolen silk and forty-one pawn tickets. Under strict questioning, he confessed to the scheme to swindle the Jiulong Silk Store. In time, Dai Ganrong, his wife Mrs. Li, his employee Xu Yongquan, and a suspect from Taizhou, Wang Ziwu,</p>
<p>arrived one after another</p>
<p>and were arrested. Six more pieces of stolen silk were also seized. Eight pieces were said to be at a dyeing shop for changing colors. The five men and women were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Zhang Shizhu from the Public Works Department detailed the case and requested an extension</p>
<p>to investigate another case.</p>
<p>He also stated that a forged check was kept in the Central Police Station and would be presented to the court when the trial opened. According to Chen Zubei and Wang Shourong, the employees of Jiulong Silk Store, who testified about the incident, Judge Zhong Qing questioned the defendants, but their statements were evasive. They claimed that the boss was a Mr. Li who was on the run. Therefore, the judge ordered them to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing for seven days for further review.</p>

<p>It was previously reported that Li Huai, the duty police sergeant at the Xinzao Public Security Sub-Bureau in Zhabei, was suddenly shot the night before last, and that the details had been recorded. It is now known that the incident occurred when a policeman from the upstairs patrol squad returned to the bureau after inspecting pedestrians. A policeman named Zhang Yunjun was in the bedroom, carelessly unloading bullets from a Mauser pistol when it accidentally discharged. The bullet shot through the floor. The duty office was located there, and at that time, the police sergeant Li</p>
<p>was washing his face by the tea table near the wall, causing the bullet to strike his lower right waist. He immediately fell to the ground in pain. Fortunately, the bullet had passed through the floorboard and had lost much of its force, so it did not pass through his body. The sub-bureau chief Liao Jiongran and other officers arrived quickly</p>
<p>and immediately ordered Police Sergeant Li to be sent to Baolong Hospital in the Concession for treatment. The injury was not critical and</p>
<p>did not pose a threat to his life. It has already been</p>
<p>communicated that Chief Liao has sent a letter to the</p>
<p>hospital, requesting the</p>
<p>doctors to treat him with care, and all medical expenses would be borne by the sub-bureau. As for the policeman Zhang Yunjun who caused the accident, he was immediately detained and yesterday was sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>Wang Changfu from Yancheng, thirty-nine years old, works as a driver at the tram company. His wife, Mrs. Wang Lin, is also thirty-nine years old. They both live at 14 Fuxi Lane, Zhongde Road, Zhabei. The couple has been married for over twenty years, and both are middle-aged. They have two sons, the eldest being eighteen years old and the youngest being seven years old. It seemed they should grow old together, but a family crisis occurred. Wang Changfu recently hired attorney Chen Guangyuan to file a suit in the local court, suing for divorce from his wife. He claimed that she did not cherish her honor in old</p>
<p>age. She claimed to be working in a factory, but she was avoiding her husband's supervision and spending all day and night outside, committing adultery without shame. She even</p>
<p>committed adultery with her maternal uncle, Zhang Hua, and the latter was recently detained in your court's detention center for theft. She visited him frequently and Zhang sent her two love letters from the detention center, filled with obscene and sickening words, even calling himself "your beloved brother Zhang Huasan." His eighteen-year-old eldest son received these letters and gave them to me. Using "brother" instead of "uncle," her adulterous</p>
<p>affair is fully exposed. Zhang Huasan is a malicious person, and I fear he will resort to violence. Therefore, I request permission for a divorce. Yesterday, Judge Yuan</p>
<p>held a hearing. The plaintiff stated as above and presented the love letters</p>
<p>as evidence. When questioned, his wife claimed that the couple was originally very harmonious, but seven years ago, her husband became involved with a woman named Zhou, and rented a small house outside. She invited relatives and friends to mediate, and as a result, he agreed to give her ten yuan of national currency per month for living expenses. Recently, he wanted to abandon her completely and falsely accused her of adultery with her maternal uncle. The case had also gone through the criminal court, and after her husband's aunt testified against her, she was acquitted. At the same time, he and his mistress beat me up, and the court fined them each ten yuan. She now requests that the court order her to live with her husband. The judge then advised both parties not to slander each other and to consider their children. He asked them to attempt reconciliation outside of court and adjourned the session.</p>

The two brothers quickly became companions on outings. The day before yesterday, Xu Zhigui went to a gambling den in Yuqing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, in the French Concession and was arrested by the police. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial. Xu Zhixun learned of this and went to the Second Special District Court to visit his cousin Xu Zhigui yesterday morning. He then learned that Zhigui could be released on bail. At 11:30 AM, Zhixun held four yuan in cash and rushed out of the Second Special District Court, intending to purchase a bail bond at the office across the street. In his haste, he ran across the road, when a Route 17 tram No. 309, driven by driver Renzhi, was driving from west to east. As it approached the Second Special District Court, Xu ran across the road, and the driver was unable to stop in time, causing Xu to be violently knocked to the ground. The tram's headlight and a five-centimeter-thick piece of glass shattered. Xu was knocked down, bleeding from his nose and mouth, and immediately fainted. The patrolmen checked and, along with the tram driver, rescued Xu and hired a car to send him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. They then took the driver to the police station for questioning. The driver</p>
<p>drove the car and was driving along. It was heard that Xu had thick glass embedded in his eye socket and was seriously injured, and that his life was in danger.</p>

Attorney Jiang Baolian from the police station charged him under Article 304 of the Criminal Code, stating that Duan had personally written a detailed confession in the police station, totaling over ten pages and thousands of words. In his confession, in addition to explaining each item of the confiscated documents, he also admitted that he was a leading figure in the strike at the Japanese spinning factory and a key member of the East District Representative Loyalty Association of the Shanghai Textile Industry Mutual Aid Society. The work of the Mutual Aid Society was to print various documents related to the strike, while the Loyalty Association assisted the workers financially. For example, when the police arrested a criminal, they found many rice tickets on his person. This person was a member of the Loyalty Association, and the rice tickets were used to provide for the striking workers. However, Duan absolutely denied any involvement with the National Salvation Association. Duan also confessed that the strike leader Yang Xiaoxian had not yet been apprehended, but Yang's brother, Yang Xiaozhong, had already been arrested and sentenced to fifty days of detention by your court. After Judge Zhan questioned Duan, he ordered Duan to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing again.</p>

Starting from the first of this month, customers who purchase goods worth two yuan or more will receive a free toy to repay the customers for their patronage over the years.</p>

<p>Excellent Machine-Made Silk Floss A silk floss material, warm and bullet-proof, is produced in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in our country. It is mostly made by hand, with limited production and expensive prices. Now, Mr. Zhang Huaidi and Mr. Li Boliang, recognizing the needs of the times, have organized a Guangya Industrial Society to produce silk floss by machine, weaving a large number of silk floss vests specifically for soldiers to protect themselves. Its warmth and elasticity are far superior to artificial silk floss, and the price is only one-quarter of that of artificial silk floss. At present, the war in North China is in full swing. Soldiers in the snowy weather can obtain a silk floss vest that is warm and bullet-proof, which is no less than obtaining a talisman.

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>In your newspaper on the date of this month, there was a new section about the donation of the Customs Finance Section colleagues to support the soldiers on the front lines. With a total of 76 yuan, it read: "Except for a few, most people have exceeded their one-day income." This sentence is very inconsistent with the facts. The largest donation was from Mr. Chen of the same section who donated 20 silver dollars. This sum only amounts to half of Mr. Chen's daily income. It should be changed to: "Except for Jia Chengkai, who donated 5 silver dollars, everyone else donated an amount less than their daily income." The person who announced this statement was Jia. He could not distinguish whether it was a large or a small number. It seems he was not satisfied with those who donated less, and he arbitrarily overturned the truth. It is not known to him that those who donated less have younger brothers and sisters who are in university or middle school, and children in elementary school. This family relies on daily income to survive. At the time of the front line support movement, they are also part of the donation. However, within Jia's household, you cannot find anyone like that. Therefore, "those who donated more were still those who donated less. The minority changed to the majority." To the editor of Shen Bao, Fang Xiyue of the Customs Finance Section, December 1.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, Your newspaper's report of the postponed questioning of Ye Fukan's case contained the phrase, "but because Wang Hanqing had already reached a settlement outside of court," which caused great surprise. Various shocking reports that defamed and accused Wang Hanqing of fraud, previously appeared in your newspaper, and you corrected them. Now there is such a rumor again, which must be due to other motives. (And the court only summoned him for the second day of the hearing, there was no postponement.) Please correct it according to law to ensure accuracy. Ye Fukan</p>
<p>Dear Editor, In your local news section of your newspaper for the past two days, there were reports of "Using Heavy Measures to Hold Back Grain, Cao Du Rice Boats Stop" and "Changshu Local Office Requests a Crackdown on Heavy Measures to Hold Back Grain." These reports are completely false. Cao Du Rice Shops do not have an agreement with city rice shops. There is only the heavy measure. There is no instance where both measures were used at the same time. The truth is there and can be confirmed. As for saying that "an apprentice robbed the scoop," it is a false accusation. In addition to questioning the Changshu Local Office, we are afraid that there will be misunderstandings from the outside world. We are writing to request a serious correction. We hope you will publish this. The Hengyi Public, Yuanchengchang, Dingtai, Zhang Xiehe and other rice shops of Caojiadu, December 1, 25th year.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Women's National Products Consumption Association, organized by women in Shanghai, was established on November 11th. Since then, the first board meeting was held to discuss all aspects of the implementation plan. The major points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Contacting the principals of various girls' schools to request them to lead all female students to join the Women's National Products Consumption Association, and mobilizing all female students to persuade their families to consistently use national products.</p>
<p>(2) Contacting various national product factories to convey opinions and findings on household consumption, and providing practical feedback on any dissatisfaction with the products, hoping for gradual improvement. At the same time, any dissatisfaction with the service attitude of the staff in national product companies should also be brought to their attention for improvement.</p>
<p>(3) Contacting various sectors of society to solicit their efforts in promoting national products. Also, it is hoped that if there are any goods commonly used by women for which there are no domestic products, they will quickly find ways to manufacture them themselves, so as to prevent the outflow of profits.</p>
<p>(4) Sending Ms. Lu Lihua to various provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan to encourage the organization of national product consumption associations for liaison purposes. Since the announcement of this proposal, it has been reported that there has been a great response in various places. The principals of various girls' schools have also begun organizing national product consumption groups and promotion groups in their schools. As a result of Ms. Lu Lihua's visits to various provinces, national product consumption associations have been organized everywhere with great momentum, and the future looks very promising. We believe that the Women's National Products Consumption Association should pay more attention to the following two matters:</p>
<p>First, investigate the sales of national products in various regions, the opinions of local women on national products, and whether national products are sufficient, or whether there are only foreign goods available for purchase and no national products.</p>
<p>Second, personally contact various factories to conduct on-site research on the products, identifying which parts should be improved, which parts should be modified, and which parts should be paid attention to. Detailed and meticulous work must be done to conduct thorough discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Winter and National Products <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Winter is coming, winter is the last season of the year; it is also the season when most people's purchasing power is at its strongest. Purchasing cotton-woven clothing, preparing winter tonics, and planning winter gifts are mostly planned and prepared in advance at the beginning of this winter season. Therefore, when winter begins to arrive, if comrades who are enthusiastic about promoting national products can take advantage of this opportunity to promote the consumption of national products to their relatives and friends, the effect will definitely be much greater than writing a few articles on national products. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>I believe that when most people are planning to prepare winter supplies, we might as well introduce them to some genuine and authentic national products and ask them to try them out. If they are satisfied with them, honestly and unreservedly ask them to purchase more and also persuade their relatives and friends to promote and use them together. If there are any shortcomings after trying them out, they may also be asked to contribute them as much as possible, so as to serve as a basis for improvement. For example, when purchasing sanitary shirts, we can introduce them to the Goose Brand sanitary shirts from the Wuhe Weaving Factory and the Duke Brand sanitary shirts from the Jinglun Shirt and Socks Factory, which are not only soft and comfortable, but also durable. For snow cream, we can introduce them to the Butterfly Cream from the Family Industry Cooperative, the Times Cream from the China Chemical Industry Cooperative, and the White Snow from the Yonghe Industrial Company. If you need to purchase overshoes because of the rainy weather in winter, then you can introduce them to the Double Coin Brand from the Greater China Rubber Factory and the Warrior Brand and Wanli Brand from the Zhenggtai Rubber Factory, as well as the Jian Gu Brand from the Yisheng Rubber Factory, and so on. We can really give a wide variety of examples, introducing some famous national product factories' well-known products to our relatives and friends as a timely reference.</p>
<p>In short, there is no need to say too much nonsense. The facts are now in front of us, and winter has arrived. How to promote this winter national product movement? How to enable the national product industry to achieve substantial progress in this winter season with strong purchasing power? This is a question worthy of study at present. At the same time, it is also what people who care about the national product movement should pay close attention to. As the saying goes: "We should not recall the past, nor dream of the future, but firmly grasp the present, because the present is the most precious."</p>
<p>Promoting national products is indeed also about grasping the reality. May everyone work hard to persuade and not let go of this promising winter national product movement.</p>
<h3 id="e201">After the Establishment of the Women's National Products Consumption Association <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yushu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's National Products Consumption Association, which has been in preparation for many years, was officially launched after holding an inauguration ceremony on the afternoon of November 11th.</p>
<p>Many people have said before that promoting national products must start with our women compatriots. Therefore, after the National Products Year for Women, the China National Products Production and Sales Association initiated the invitation of women compatriots to organize a Women's National Products Consumption Association during the New Year's social event this spring. At that time, many people volunteered to join. In the past six months, with the efforts of female national product visitors, the number of members has been increasing day by day, and now there are nearly a thousand members.</p>
<p>Although there are many national product organizations in Shanghai, this is the first women's organization. Therefore, I would like to offer some personal opinions after the establishment of the association:</p>
<p>First, we must practice what we preach. Our compatriots have a common problem, which is that they embrace a perfunctory and careless attitude in everything. Someone asks me to join an organization, and I agree vaguely because it is difficult to refuse due to face, but afterwards I never get close to that organization and become a "honorary member" forever. We should correct this attitude, especially after joining this Women's National Products Consumption Association, it is not just a matter of hanging up a name and signing a voluntary statement! You must know that using national products is our obligation, and to put it plainly, it can also be regarded as our right. We are Chinese people and cannot give up the right to use Chinese goods. After I swear to join this association, I should abide by the association's creed. I myself need to use national products and promote them, so that the entire family also uses national products. Most of the members who join the association are housewives. If they can all abide by this creed, they can quickly make everything used in each family purely national products.</p>
<p>Second, we should expand the organization. The current number of members is obviously insufficient in terms of both quality and quantity. There is a Women's National Products Consumption Association in Xi'an, which has more than 30,000 members. Compared with the population ratio, we should try our best to develop it. Moreover, the scope of future recruitment should be expanded to include general housewives, shop assistants, factory workers, and other consumer groups. The more widespread the publicity and the more people who participate, the more effective it will be.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of the Women's National Products Consumption Association, in the entire national product cause, they are still only standing on the consumer side. If they can more actively promote production work, so that the national product industry can be developed and innovated, that would be what the author hopes for!</p>
<h3 id="e202">When the Weather is Cool but Not Cold, A Proposal to Compatriots <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Time flies, and in the blink of an eye, it is autumn again! In the present "cool but not cold weather", everyone is busy preparing autumn and winter clothes. Of course, the manuscripts published in this journal naturally belong to national products. My manuscript is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>The slogan of promoting national products has been shouted for three or four years, and the banner of the National Products Year has also been raised for several years. However, what are our achievements? Although it cannot be said that there are absolutely none, upon detailed inspection, it is quite pitiful. Especially now, goods from imported brands have filled the market, and a certain national product is very active. Looking back at national products, they are full of lifelessness. Everything is really worrying.</p>
<p>No matter what we do, we must be based on the spirit of perseverance. Promoting national products is naturally the same. Therefore, we must continue to work hard. Now, it is already autumn! Among our compatriots, many want to prepare autumn or winter clothes. I hope everyone will make a determination and not forget the four characters of promoting national products when preparing autumn and winter clothes. Of course, the amount of national products we promote is very small. However, gathering the power of the majority can be very substantial. For example, among the 400 million people in China, 40 million people prepare autumn and winter clothes, and calculating an average of one yuan per person, it would be 40 million yuan. If all of them buy national products, then 40 million yuan can be used for the development of national product manufacturers. If all of them buy imported goods, then this 40 million yuan will become a leakage of the country's wealth, and national product manufacturers will suffer a major blow. This is the meaning of "many grains of sand form a tower" and "many fox furs make a robe."</p>
<p>Compatriots! I hope everyone will not create a leakage of even one cent. I am sincerely praying.</p>
<h3 id="e203">National Products for the Common People <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>To increase the effectiveness of national products and expand the sales of national products, in addition to striving for excellent quality, it is also necessary to strive for low prices, so that national products can penetrate into the lives of the common people.</p>
<p>Now that the season has entered the cold winter, people have to purchase winter supplies. National product manufacturers who manufacture winter products should pay attention to this point. It is absolutely inappropriate to make the goods high in price, so as not to miss the opportunity to promote sales and cause imported goods to rise --</p>
<p>Thermos bottles are also a major winter supply. Among national products, thermos bottles like the Earth Brand (manufactured by Wuzhou Pharmacy) have good quality and effectiveness. However, the price used to be slightly expensive. It is said that the price has recently been reduced by 40 cents per bottle in national currency, so that ordinary people can afford to buy them. This attitude of making national products accessible to the common people is indeed worth mentioning.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Puppet <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>Speaking of "puppet," one cannot help but feel quite heartbroken, because there are too many Chinese people with puppet-like qualities. At the same time, the influence of puppets on the country cannot be considered small. However, it is very pitiful! Those who are acting as puppets still think they are carrying out promotions and are grateful to tears.</p>
<p>Puppets are called "big stage palace戏" or "托偶" by northerners, and "本人头戏" by southerners. As for the invention of Chinese puppets, it dates back to the Zhou Muwang era more than 900 years before the Christian era. In the book Liezi, it is recorded that Yan Shi made clay figures, dressed them in human clothes, and held them to dance. The puppets made eyes at the left and right of the king, and the king did not know it was a play, and was very angry and wanted to kill him. Yan Shi was afraid and quickly destroyed the clay figures, which were made of cinnabar glue and lacquer. Also, when Emperor Gaozu of Han heard Chen Ping's plan, he carved wooden beauties to dance on the siege walls to show off to the Guan clan. The Guan clan was afraid of losing favor, and ordered Modun to lift the siege, so Emperor Gaozu was able to escape. From the Tang to the Song dynasties, the types of puppets became increasingly prosperous, including suspended silk puppets, wire puppets, gunpowder puppets, rod puppets, meat puppets, and water puppets. Various names were almost as developed as actors and dramas. Also, according to various records, puppets were also called 窟儡子, also known as 魁　子, also known as 郭秃, also known as 郭公. In the puppet shows of the Tang Dynasty, there was also Guo Lang. In short, they were nothing more than things for people to play with.</p>
<p>As for puppet poems, what I can know is one by Tang Minghuang and one by Han Nizhou's clan son. Tang Minghuang's poem was written for Li Fuguo when he moved to the Western Palace. The poem is: "Carved wood and pulled silk to make an old man, chicken skin and crane hair are the same as real, after playing for a while, there is nothing, still a dream in life." Song Ren Pang Pingying's Tan Souzai: "Han Nizhou held a banquet in Nan Garden, and his clan son Pan Yuan was there. During the banquet, someone offered a silk puppet to be a clay figure carrying a small child, named Yingchun Huang Pang. Han wished his clan son, you can write poetry, you can sing. He immediately accepted the order and sang a poem: 'Stepping on the void and playing with spring, one person must settle on his head, suddenly the thread breaks in the child's hand, and the flesh and blood become dust on the road.' Han was very unhappy." These two poems are excellent. "'After playing for a while, there is nothing, still a dream in life.' 'Suddenly the thread breaks in the child's hand, and the flesh and blood become dust on the road.' I would like to say to the 'meat puppets' who are willing to be child emperors and recognize thieves as fathers, let's review these words three times.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Mr. Dunlop <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Mr. Dunlop is one of my colleagues. He is fat, has a round face, and is always smiling. Anyone who meets him feels very approachable. But after interacting with him a few times, everyone has to shake their heads at him.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunlop's surname is not Dunlop, and his name is not Lu Pu. The name Dunlop was given to him by his colleagues because Mr. Dunlop has a very special habit. As long as there is a little bit of a small advantage, even if he gets glared at or ridiculed, he doesn't care at all. Therefore, everyone rushed to call him Dunlop, saying that his skin is as thick as a Dunlop car tire. When he first became famous, he was a little shy about this nickname and didn't dare to accept it, but now, he takes it for granted.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunlop always has an empty cigarette case all year round, but within the six or seven hours of office work every day, he has to smoke at least ten cigarettes. The only source of his cigarettes is to ask his colleagues for them with a thick face. Fortunately, there are nearly twenty colleagues. In addition to those who do not smoke, on average, each person gives him a few, which is enough. But if someone refuses to give him one, he will make a ghost face and say, "Dunlop can touch Goodyear." Because Goodyear is also a type of tire, everyone is afraid of having a strange title, so they finally give him one to end the matter. Sometimes, when he has nowhere to get a cigarette, he goes to ask the director questions, and in the end, he always grabs one from the cigarette can on the director's desk. Recently, the director also knows his trick, so when he sees him coming up, he always gives him one first, and then, leaving behind a few names, he leaves with a cigarette in his mouth.</p>
<p>All year round, he doesn't spend a penny to buy snacks. If other colleagues buy crab shell yellow or fried steamed buns, he always makes sure to get a bite. Starting last year, we organized a monthly dinner party, held once a month. At that time, we invited Dunlop to join, but he shook his head and said, "It's not interesting, I won't join." But when we have a dinner party, he always comes as an uninvited guest. Later, we always secretly try not to let him know the date and location, but sometimes, he still finds out and comes on time, eating and drinking for free with laughter and talk, not stopping until he is completely drunk. If there is a festival in someone's home, then naturally he will not be absent.</p>
<p>Recently, the tea room attendant A'er also calls him Mr. Dunlop, because he has pestered him to go to the amusement park twice and drink once. In the end, he always patted his butt and thanked him, watching A'er take out his wallet to pay.</p>

<h3 id="e209">The World's Largest Telescope <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The Mount Palomar Ridge in California is now building an observatory. The large telescope used in the observatory has a mirror surface of 200 inches and costs 2 million US dollars. Looking at the sky through this telescope, the distance can be increased by twice as much as all existing telescopes. It can discover stars and nebulae that have never been imagined before, and it can make the moon feel closer to the earth, as if it were only 2,500 miles away. The glass blank used for the mirror is like a large round block of butter, weighing ten tons. In order to grind this glass into a mirror surface, a special machine was built. Its form is like a record player, weighing fifty tons, and the machine has two giant arms, like the curved handle that inserts the needle on a record player. Instead of inserting a needle, it is inlaid with a cast iron disc, with a diameter from four feet to nine feet, which rubs against the glass. Needless to say, the position for the record is the large piece of glass. The machine has been running since May of this year, and has barely stopped until now. It will probably take another twenty months to complete. The machine is placed in an optical laboratory with heavy curtains, no sunlight, no dust, and clean air. Skilled craftsmen who grind glass and great literary figures take care of this work. The glass must be ground into a parabolic concave surface, with the center about four inches lower than the sides. The polishing work is extremely fine. If there is a defect of one millionth of an inch, it can be detected and immediately eliminated. The machine rotates once every minute, which seems to be very slow. In fact, this project began in 1928. It was not until December 1934 that 104 ladles of molten glass were used to cast a large glass blank at a temperature one-fifth of that of the sun. The blank was left as a whole for a year, and the temperature gradually decreased and cooled. Then, it was transported by special train from Corning, New York to Pasadena, where the machine was polished. It is expected to be completed by 1940, forming a telescope. When polishing, it is necessary to be very careful not to have any spots or lines. The large piece of glass can be erected to check for spots or whether it is flat. During the inspection, extremely strong light must be used, and shot from a tube onto the mirror surface. If the mirror surface is absolutely flat, then the mirror will be as bright as a full moon. If there are uneven spots on the mirror surface, then dark spots will appear, and then that point must be polished again. Before the completion of three years of work, more than three tons of glass must be removed. The main material used for polishing is emery and gemstone slurry. Experts cannot estimate how much slurry is needed. While the polishing machine is turning slowly, other preparations are being carried out step by step. It is expected that the mirror can be used around 1940, and then the stars that can be seen in the sky can be one or two times farther than they are now. The site for building the observatory has already been purchased on the 6,126-foot Mount Palomar Ridge. First, a road must be built from the foot of the mountain to the ridge to transport materials. An airfield will also be built to accommodate scientists from the California Institute of Technology and other groups. In addition, US$1 million will be used to build houses to house the auxiliary machinery and all the instruments that have been built at the California Institute of Technology. The frame of the telescope weighs 850 tons and is currently being manufactured in Philadelphia. Among them is a 55-foot-long lattice metal tube, in which a scientist can sit to use the telescope, like a bird in a cage. After the meteorological observatory is completed in the future, it can peek into the stars in the sky that people have never seen before. The estimated cost is between US$6 million and US$10 million. Most of it has already been raised from the Rockefeller Foundation, a coal oil tycoon.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Swearing Allegiance with a Glass of Water, Grieving in a Green Light; Hooking Gold and Promising Love with Red Beans</p>
<p>There was a letter with the note, gently narrating, all about sending this ring. Among them was a passage:</p>
<p>"We have always been friends in righteousness, so the items given to each other may as well be regarded as gifts given by friends in righteousness, so as to set off the spirit and preserve the memory. There is no need to regard it with worldly eyes and have any scruples."</p>
<p>These few dozen words can be said to completely free Guo Qi from the situation he imagined. Because of this, it is definitely Meng Lan's tone. He gave the gold ring out of his own volition, there is no doubt about it. With this letter, Guo Qi pondered for one night, and felt that he could not get rid of the words "friends in righteousness", which was a kind of depression. But he didn't know what Meng Lan's true meaning was, and what he had with him, and he couldn't say that the words "friends in righteousness" were not what he had to say. Therefore, on the surface, he would never deny the words "friends in righteousness". Early the next morning, he took down a small rosewood box from the bookshelf, opened it, and there were many beloved small items inside. The best was a small rectangular brocade box, only the size of a thumb. Inside, there were two red beans padded with white velvet. There was a piece of glass on the brocade box, so you could see it without opening the lid. On the bottom of the box, in small print, was written an ancient poem, "This thing is the most lovesick." He picked it up and played with it for a long time, and also found a Western-style envelope to put it in along with the box. Then, he wrote a line from the Book of Songs on it, "Forever and ever, for the good." After he had dealt with it properly, he wrote another letter, with the envelope clearly marked "Respectfully entrust to deliver to your friend, Mr. Mingshan." He also put a lot of thought into the two words "Mingshan". He used Mingshan to allude to Yougu. From the two words Yougu, he then involved the word Lan. This was a meaning that only people inside the circle could understand. He put both envelopes on the desk, and he felt very at ease. He only hoped that Miss Li, the messenger, would arrive. After sitting quietly for a while, looking at the shadow of the sun outside the window, he carefully read the letter he had received last night again, and said to himself: "It says clearly that he will come this morning." But then he turned around and thought to himself, the so-called morning includes everything before twelve o'clock, and it is still only ten o'clock now, of course there is still a while. So he suppressed his impatience, picked up a book and read it, and ground an inkstone of ink and wrote two large calligraphy characters. After all this was done, the clock in the hall naturally struck twelve times. The morning appointment had been missed. Whether this Miss Li would be able to send out his two lovesick beans on his behalf was unknown. (105)</p>

<p>— Shen Zhen</p>
<p>The beauty of Ming Sheng lies not in the lake but in the stream, not in the water but in the mountain. I have explored it thoroughly, and only after a long time did I begin to grasp its essence. Circling the lake once, admiring the first hints of green melting into the dawn and the gentle rising of spring mist, I thought I had seen it all. Later, climbing Taoguang Peak and scaling Wansong Peak, looking down at the Qiantang River like a ribbon and the secluded bays like snails, I again thought I had seen it all. After numerous visits, I gradually grew tired of it and secretly wondered at the mediocrity of what I had once thought beautiful. So, I roamed to the farthest reaches, determined to explore its wonders. But even with Cloud Dwelling Temple, Nine Creeks, Misty Glow, and the Three Bamboo Temples, my footsteps reaching far and wide, I found nothing. Then one day, passing through Li'an, the openness and remoteness, the quietness, held a different charm. Initially, I didn't pay much attention, but a refreshing breeze suddenly passed by, opening my eyes wide, and I began to explore it with my staff. I felt an overwhelming surge of emerald green, my eyebrows almost transforming, mountain birds singing occasionally, and a zither playing on the rocks. It was secluded but not desolate, containing but not revealing, occupying the harmony of the land and capturing the interest in stillness. Gradually, I found it extraordinary and decided to stay for a day to enjoy it. At noon, the rooster was silent, the monks didn't chant, the fading sun came and went, the empty mountain was silent, and the fun of the recluse was in the painting. The trees wrote rhymes, the mountain breeze passed through the creek, weary feathers shook their clothes, and a slight coolness arose on the sleeves. The fun was in the evening. At night, the clock struck once, the clear chimes moved slowly, the fragrant chanting was like rain, and the faint sound of the stream was heard. The fun was on the pillow. When the birds woke me up in the morning, the first rays of sunlight leaked through the pillow, the overnight mist gradually dissipated, the vibrant green seemed to flow, the morning chants echoed around the beams, and the dreams of yesterday left no trace. The fun of the morning was different from usual. I felt happy and content, reluctantly leaving, with the lingering taste in my thoughts. Its beauty is like Li Geng looking at a stele, only after repeated contemplation does one truly understand. I regretted not being able to live there freely, staying for three days. Like suddenly obtaining a bright pearl, a wonderful interest suddenly arose. I rented a small boat, untied the loose wooden [unclear word], and followed the creek road out. For dozens of miles, there was no break. The wonderful view was complete. The green cicadas were a thousand heads, and the yellow shirts were on both banks. The bridges were bustling, and the oranges were lively. The frost-covered forests were scattered with red, and the wild fields were covered in purple. The persimmons were clustered, and the chestnuts were bunched. After entering another ten miles, the ultimate beauty was the reed catkins. This was West Creek. The creek was known for its reed catkins. For ten miles around the water, east, west, north, and south, the chaotic streams were like a spider web, and the veins were all connected. There was no creek without reeds. When the boat entered its borders, front, back, left, and right, it twisted and turned, drawing the oar into the deep waves, and the first and last were all reed catkins. Silver light fluttered, greeting with bows and seeing off with deep bows. Leaning on the side of the boat, I admired the view. The accumulated colors flowed, and the softness was lovely. My hair and eyebrows were white, and the dust on my clothes was all gone. I moored at Autumn Snow Hermitage, which was the most beautiful place in West Creek. Climbing the stairs, I tapped my fingers, and hundreds of poets from past dynasties in Zhejiang were worshiped. The arrangement was simple and elegant, and the cold interest was pleasant. Opening the window, I saw ten thousand reeds reflecting each other, a piece of auspicious silver, a snowy scene. Within ten miles, there was no hidden shadow. Looking at each one, the color changed, and the width was different. A monk asked about the road, cooked creek water to make tea, and offered cakes to alleviate hunger, quite attentive. Staying overnight would be a great thing, but unfortunately, the dust of the world urged dreams, and I regretted not being able to stay a little longer. Going out to the Interwoven Reeds Hermitage, the land turned secluded and remote. The couplets in the building were extremely exquisite, with unique and wonderful meanings. Looking at the reed catkins, one could also exhaust their appearance. There was also an ancient ancestral hall in the creek, worshiping Fan Xie, the great master. The two virtuous men were old friends, and their actions were open and unrestrained, not just known as children of poetry. The walls of the hall were engraved with several verses of Da Zong's poem mourning Fan Xie. The couplet "The eastern suburbs are cold after the vegetable-picking festival, the southern country is sad at the silkworm-gathering spring" was once widely circulated, admired as the concluding verse of the poem mourning Fan Xie. I could imagine the depth of the two men's righteousness. Hundreds of years later, stroking their handwriting, I couldn't help but feel a strange emotion. Turning to Liu Xia, I climbed the Flower Mound. The bamboo path was high and deep, quiet and contemplative, only hearing the sound of footsteps mixed with the bamboo's rustling, the stillness becoming solemn. There was a pavilion on the ridge, with an old woman serving tea. Sitting for a long time, I forgot my fatigue. Feeling a little hungry, I ate a few salted chicken eggs and returned. The beauty of the creek could be compared to Li'an. Although the mountains and waters were different, their beauty was not inferior. This is why I know that the beauty of Ming Sheng should be sought outside the lake and mountains.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Italy and Japan Form Another Alliance <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>I remember that just two days ago, the Italian ambassador to China still stated that rumors of an agreement between Italy and Japan, with Japan recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and Italy recognizing Manchukuo as an exchange condition, were completely "rumors." But the Italy-Japan agreement has actually been realized. This has left the Italian ambassador in an awkward position, only able to tell reporters: "I don't know if this is the case at all, and I have nothing to say," and so on. For a long time, I have been preparing to muster the courage to admire Mussolini and Hitler. But reality always makes it difficult for me to do so. For example, after reading Hitler's "Mein Kampf," which says that Chinese people are an inferior race, I thought that I would not be honored to serve the highest authority among the superior races as a slave. This chilled half of my heart for admiring Hitler. Now, I have discovered that Germany and Italy, personally arranged by Hitler and Mussolini, are on very friendly terms with those who are invading us. Aren't the friends of our enemies also our enemies? Even the most foolish and hopeless person would not willingly feed tigers and wolves with their own flesh. This chilled another half of the heart I had prepared to admire the two heroes, Mussolini and Hitler. The remaining thoughts are still to guard the door, outside which a group of tigers and wolves are staring at me!</p>
<p>Of course, when a tiger and wolf wants to enter your door, it will never wear a frightening fur coat, but will be disguised. For example, if our "friendly nation" wants to announce its "Royal Way" in our country, spreading the grace of the "Manchu Empire" to the heads of every Chinese person, it would be frightening to say so honestly. Therefore, the substitute slogans are "friendship," "cooperation," and joint defense against something. They say that this is a great plan of a Royal Way state to establish peace in East Asia and pacify the world, and that the Chinese people must "thoroughly understand" it. Recently, they have also been saying: "The Inner Mongolian army's operations in Suiyuan are due to the increasing oppression by the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese military groups closely related to Communist organizations, so they have no choice but to defend themselves in this way. The goal of Inner Mongolia coincides with the urgent national policy of Japan and Manchukuo. The Japanese military authorities hope for the success of Inner Mongolia, so they cannot be indifferent to incidents that would harm the security and order of Manchukuo or Bolshevize the entire territory of China" (Joint announcement by Manchukuo and the Kwantung Army on the military situation in eastern Suiyuan). According to this announcement, the logic is: all those who oppose Manchukuo are Communists; and the Chinese troops currently fighting against the Inner Mongolian army are all members of the Chinese Communist Party or have close ties to the Communist Party. Therefore, if all of China opposes Manchukuo, it proves that China has been completely Bolshevized; and if all of China is not to be Bolshevized, in other words, the entire territory of China must be "Royal Way-ized." To rephrase it, opposing Manchukuo and Bolshevization are two sides of the same coin, so if you don't want Bolshevization, the only option is for all of China to submit to the Royal Way" and support the Japanese Empire—this is not a literary game, but that is indeed what our "friendly nation" means.</p>
<p>The Japan-Italy alliance has once again revealed the true face of the expansionists. According to the above "either/or" explanation for China, under the Japan-Italy-Germany alliance, China's fate is: either be their dog or be a ghost under their knife—there is no other way!</p>
<p>Is there really no other way?</p>
<h3 id="e213">At Sea <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Mingxia</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Chapter 1</p>
<p>When the horizon could be faintly seen, the sky began to darken. In the faintly visible western sky, black clouds were busily floating, like a suddenly chaotic crowd, bumping and squeezing each other.</p>
<p>The captain, who was in charge of the helm, firmly grasped the rudder handle, and the boat sailed straight southwest. "There will be a storm tonight," he thought.</p>
<p>He stared at the sky, his experienced eyes seeming to see through the wind and clouds as if they were tangible things. The sea was relatively calm.</p>
<p>A seagull spread its white wings and swept past the side of the boat, giving him a glimpse of brightness.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>. He looked at the滔滔 waters, testing the speed of the boat: then looked at the chaotic black clouds, estimating the speed of the wind. He was very confident that the boat would reach the shore first, and then the wind would strike.</p>
<p>The waves seemed to be even calmer than before, and the sails were taking the full force of the favorable wind, slightly bulging like a belly full of food. But he felt dissatisfied. He released the rudder and turned the winch holding the sail a few times, so that the sail stretched straight to the masthead, very upright, and the boat sailed faster.</p>
<p>Several young sailors were lying on the deck, happily talking about women, and sometimes even laughing out loud. The captain was reluctant to break their happy atmosphere, and忍着 not to tell them what was about to happen.</p>
<p>The sky was completely black, and the black clouds covered half of the sky. Only a few large stars on the eastern side of the sea were twinkling vigorously. - They were getting closer to the harbor.</p>
<p>The sea was unusually silent, and the speed of the ship suddenly slowed down. The captain stretched out his hand—there was not a single wisp of wind. This was the silence before the storm. He knew: Today he failed to race against the storm. But he did not say anything yet. The black clouds had swallowed all the remaining stars.</p>
<p>The young sailors lying on the deck were also startled by the unusual silence of the sea. They stood up one after another and checked everything on the ship. One person lit a glass ship's lantern, and then there was only one light on the dark sea.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as if being carried on the back of something big, the boat rose high. The sea stood up, and in the dim lamplight, countless huge waves crashed down on the boat like collapsing rocks.</p>
<p>The wind was like a giant swirling, raising the ship with its full sails, constantly moving forward and backward.</p>
<p>At this moment, the rain fell like pouring, hitting his jacket-covered shoulders, making him feel heavy</p>
<p>The captain stood holding the helm. He wanted to break through the storm's encirclement, but he couldn't, the boat just retreated.</p>
<p>"Drop the sails!" So he had to issue such an order. The wind blowing in his face was too strong, and none of the sailors busy with other things heard him.</p>
<p>The boat retreated even faster, "Drop the sails, drop the sails!" He had to shout as hard as he could, but it was still useless. The wind was stronger, the rain was heavier, the ship's lantern was surrounded by a curtain of rain, and he felt the sky was darker standing at the stern of the ship.</p>
<p>The boat kept going backwards, and even in the darkness, the captain knew very clearly that it was about to retreat to a place with reefs. So he resolutely released the rudder, grabbed a kitchen knife, ran to the base of the mast, and desperately chopped at the sail ropes.</p>
<p>The rope broke, and the sail quickly fell, but stopped in the middle. A rope was caught in the pulley. Immediately, one person climbed up like a monkey.</p>
<p>Without securing the rudder, the boat lost control. The wind was spinning, and the boat was spinning too. There was too much rain accumulated on the deck, and the sailors splashed in all directions as they ran. Suddenly, the taut sail and the person who climbed up fell together.</p>
<p>The storm was even more delighted and showing its power, and the boat was tilting left and right. The sailors all knew that they could no longer control the balance of the ship at this time, so they simply sat still.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the captain shouted loudly, another ship was nearby. A little light could be seen through the rain. The pole extending from the stern of the boat had already touched the hull of the other boat. If they retreated again, the two boats would be shattered by the collision.</p>
<p>So all the sailors on both boats were mobilized, desperately pushing each other with poles to keep them at a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>The distance was at most five or six feet, but everyone's shouting sounded like it was half a mile away. In order to make the other party hear clearly, they dragged out each word very long, but the ending was always swallowed by the storm.</p>
<p>The struggle continued for two hours, and the storm finally passed. Then, everyone escaped from the line of death and breathed a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The rain was still falling patiently, and the two boats sailed connected towards a familiar harbor. The ship's lantern illuminated the accumulated water on the deck, very brightly.</p>
<p>Someone in the houses next to the small harbor woke up in the middle of the night and heard the happy shouts of several sailors in the gentle sound of the rain.</p>
<p>Ah... Hey!... Ah... Hey!...</p>

No matter how shameless or corrupt you are, as long as you are an official, you can still safely hold your office afterwards. No matter how patriotic you are, how willing you are to think of the people, but you are a humble prostitute, you still have to be your prostitute afterwards; and if you make a mistake in the hands of the 'officials', you can't expect to get away lightly. Your home is confiscated, and you are driven out of the city, as happened to Sai Jinhua.</p>

<p>The climate is fresh in the second month of spring. Celestial winds blow down the sound of emptiness. Looking up into the clouds, there is a ladder to climb. I see that the roc has achieved its ambitions, soaring straight up to the sky. It is only because the east wind is intentionally lifting it up, showing off its talents and standing out from the crowd.</p>
<p>A celestial skirt is left to the swallows. Several elegant performances harmonize with the orioles. I don't know where the Xiao and Yu Sheng flutes are playing. This song is not from heaven. They all say that beautiful women sing and dance well. Look at it, fluttering like a startled swan, as light as a flying swallow in the sky. It is like Cai Wenji's Eighteen Songs on the Tartar Pipe, like Xiang Ling drumming the zither with a resounding sound. It is like Zhao Jun's lament on the Pipa, like the talented Red Thread stealing the box lightly. Look at her, with thin sleeves made of plain silk, and clean, light gauze. A pair of jade arms dances with the wind, happily learning the fashionable posture. It is all because of the frivolous and cunning appearance of the rascal boy. Green Pearl guards against those who fall from the building. I am only afraid that the Yang branch is tender and weak. Therefore, a red silk rope is tied to the foot. Sometimes, the wind is crazy, and the shadow flips in the air, playing the role of Yang Guifei emerging from the bath. It is not the true face of Mount Lu. Where can one find a soulmate? If one day she falls into the dust of the world, it will provoke many onlookers' cold eyes. Therefore, stand firm and do not lose your footing. Hold on to where you can stay. Do not cut the paper tiger. Also, guard against sudden rain and wind. It turns out that living in this world is all a dream, drifting with the wind like floating clouds. It is all the same, rising and falling together.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Worn-Out"</p>
<p>Continuous drizzling rain, worn-out dog. Lotus thinking of spring, constantly moving with sorrowful sleep. Orioles and flowers have passed, peach and willow trees are withered. The beginning of summer makes people厌. The beauty is sitting alone in her boudoir, doing needlework, chatting to relieve the worries of her heart. Waiting for her lover to return home early, enjoying the joys of morning and evening like immortals. Most hateful, her lover has been gone for three years without any news. Looking back on the past, it is truly pitiful. Could it be that he has met a prostitute in a foreign land, and his heart has changed in that gentle town? This has caused me to not think about tea or food for three meals a day, and it is difficult to sleep during the long days and short nights. This has caused me to have no heart to do anything during the day, and to guard half a bed alone at night. This has caused me to hang like a bright moon in the sky, with only the shadow of a lonely swallow in front of the window. This has caused me to have muddled thoughts and a disordered mind, and to lie sick for half a year. Fortunately, the divine doctor's holy hand has brought my sick body back to spring and safety. Thinking back, my pair of charming eyes were black and bright, and my face was like a lotus flower. Thinking back, my strands of green silk were like black clouds, but now, it is difficult to manage the bald hair with the bun. Thinking back, my flower-like face and moon-like appearance were plump, but now, I am sallow and skinny in front of the mirror. Thinking back, my figure was slender and healthy, with beautiful curves, but now, I am so thin that I am barely connected. Thinking of the endless sadness, tears fall one after another on my chest. Who will pity my worn-out face?</p>

<h3 id="e219">Shakespeare's Famous Play "As You Like It" Brought to the Screen <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>MGM's "Romeo and Juliet" is about to be released, and another famous Shakespearean play, "As You Like It," has also been brought to the screen, and it is said that it will soon be shown publicly in Shanghai. In these two years, Shakespeare's works seem to be very popular in the film industry. "As You Like It" is a play that starts with tragedy and ends with happiness. Among many of Shakespeare's plays, this is the most lighthearted and fluent, and this film fully preserves the atmosphere of the original work and is performed dramatically. The heroine, Elizabeth Bergner, is the star of the famous film "Catherine the Great." This British actress has performed Shakespearean plays on stage more than six hundred times. Of course, she is more than qualified to play the role of Rosalind in "As You Like It," which is beyond the reach of ordinary American movie stars. All those who love Shakespeare's works, wait for a satisfying enjoyment.</p>

<p>In Zhu Shilin's "Ghost", ghostly shadows and sounds appear in the dark room of Li Lili. The setting is eerie and terrifying, and the timid Li Lili cannot help but feel her hair stand on end.</p>
<p>He Mengfu's "Moonlit Night Scene" is co-starred by Li Qing and Zong. It has a superb conception and is full of satire and humor. It can be called a literary work.</p>
<p>Situ Huimin's section "Two Hands of Money" records the waste of the rich, who use two-yuan banknotes as cigarette wrappers, while the poor use them to support the whole family and even cause crime. It contains deep meaning. Starring Mei Jingxi and Lan Ping.</p>
<p>The "Moonlit Night Scene" was composed and scored by the famous musician Sha Mei. It is tragic and desolate, like weeping and complaining.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Touching "Forged Love" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>May heaven and earth endure, but this love will know no end.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's great tragedy "Romeo and Juliet" will be given its first Far East honorable screening at the Nanjing Grand Theatre tomorrow night at 9:15 PM. The Chinese translation of the film is "Forged Love." The story in the film is the love story of a pair of young men and women. The meeting of the two at the Ye Yan Ming Lantern, the love words of the two in the Red Window Tower. The frequent singing促, the separation of the two. The ghost made a mistake, and the two drank their hatred and died for love. What is particularly heart-wrenching is the platform love scene. The beauty of the scenery and the moving dialogue in this scene are the crown of the love scenes in each film. The original platform love words written by Shakespeare are widely praised as a famous article in literature. The "Forged Love" filmed by MGM this time, starring Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, is more beautiful and moving than Shakespeare's original work.</p>
