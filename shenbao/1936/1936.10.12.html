<h3>評駱斯曼爾爵士在日之談話</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>英國報業鉅子駱斯曼爾爵士Lord　Rothermer。近遨游遠東。道過日本。於犧舟橫濱之際。曾與東京記者談話。謂英國人民極願英日同盟之復活。惟不應以反對美國為目標。爵士之意。以為英國願結歡日本。亦不願失歡美國。魚與熊掌。欲兼而有之。此項談話。出於駱斯曼爾爵士之口。吾人頗有注意之必要也。</p>
<p>爵士為已故英國報業大王北巖爵士之弟。自北巖長逝。爵士卽繼承其業。現為倫敦每日郵報每日鏡報新聞晚報等刋物之中人。其資本勢力。更支配英國造紙業之大部份。及各地方之報章雜誌。每日讀其刋物者。在千萬左右。全部財產達數千萬鎊。英國報紙。十之八九操於報業三鉅頭之手。一為勃萊爵士。一為皮佛白郞克爵士。一卽駱斯曼爾爵士。勃萊經營報業。純為營利性質。於政治上無多主張。皮佛白郞克於政治有狂熱。然彼之資力。遠遜於北巖兄弟。其主張與駱斯曼爾取同調。其企業中亦有駱斯曼爾之資本。故駱斯曼爾報系實為目前英國輿論界之最大力量。彼思想保守。與英國之法西斯蒂領袖摩思萊爵士頗有關係。所發表之談話。可以代表保守之英入心。理而彼於遠東有何觀。察大足以左右英國人民之視聽。與政府之態度也。</p>
<p>茲試就爵士之英日同盟主張論之。英之遠凍政策。常徘徊於英日妥協與英美合作二者之間。自大戰以遝。美日之關係。日趨惡劣。英日之利益。衝突加多。於是兼顧美日之政策。發生困難。至一九二二年華府會議開幕。英遂不得不放棄其英日同盟之舊政策。以四國公約為代替。降至今日。四國公約之精神。已破壞無餘英。方有事於歐洲。對於遠東之事。但求苟且之偸安。使日本對於英國在中國南洋等處權益予以相當尊重。則英日同盟之恢復。未始非英人之所願。羅斯爵士之東來。許閣森大使之訪日。均抱有此種希冀。然事實證明英日不但無妥恊之可能。卽有妥恊。亦無保全英美友誼及維持英帝國團結之希望。魚與熊掌。不可得而兼也。</p>
<p>日本已聲明遠東之政治問題。第三國無置喙之權。而英國現在遠東之武力。已非歐戰以前可比。故對於遠東事件。英國已失去與日本平等之發言力。欲勉强博得日本之好感。非出甚高之代價不可。如印度澳洲等市塲之開放。承認日本在華之特殊地位。均為其例。苟英國能容忍此種犧牲。則英日同盟之成立。無異英國退出遠東之政治舞台。使日本在中國及南洋一帶為所欲為耳。英帝國各子國如加拿大澳洲新錫蘭等。於日本之侵略野心。久懷恐懼。其傳統政策。為促成英美之合作。藉美國在太平洋之優越武力。以維持彼輩之安全。英日同盟苟能成立觸。美國之怒則。此自治領諸邦必寗與母國離貳。而投入美國之懷抱。一旦美日失和。倫敦政府袒日。大英帝國必全部瓦解。而盎格羅撒克遜民族必認華盛頓為首都矣。</p>
<p>吾人以為東亞集體安全制度之維持。為英國唯一有利之途。而當此日本侵略氣燄萬丈之時。恣談英日同盟。以求保存眼前之蠅頭微利。而犧牲友邦之利益。本國之理想。與强鄰之好感。殊非得計。欲恢復四國公約之精神。唯有英美合作。促日本之覺悟。團結和平之勢力。使侵略勢力就範。不但為東亞諸國之急務。亦全球人類目前臟有之努力。英國之報業領袖更宜積極提倡。願以此意。奉獻駱斯曼爾爵士之前。</p>

<p>實部訓詞</p>
<p>實業部科長馬克强致訓詞云、絲茶兩業、在我國國際貿易上佔重要之地位、年來因出口衰落、致入超增加、其影響於整個民族經濟甚大、以前組織散漫、在於從事茶業者各為個人利益計劃、而不顧及整個事業之發展、將失去國際貿易之地位、而考研其缺點、在於技術之落後、實部已着手研究改良生產、並嚴格實施檢騐、以提高品質、至於運銷方法、亦應同時改善、總之、政府一以整個利益為前提、決非代表一階級或一部份之利益、尚望全國茶商貢獻意見俾得體察各方情形、確定根本辦法、共謀發展、本人並代表實部敬祝協會之成功云云、</p>
<p>演詞　誌</p>
<p>（一）國際貿易局代表王世　演說、略云、我國今年正積極從事於經濟之建設、欲整個之發展、須就各一業加以改良、否則處於閒置世界潮流中、對外不足以言抵抗國際競爭之壓迫、對內不足謀各種事業之發展、貴會集全國從事茶業之前輩、組織是健全、當能發生偉大之效果、（二）上海商品檢騐局代表吳覺農演說、略云、本人希望貴會共同團結、以　外侮、蓋我國茶業之衰弱、固在茶農茶商茶號之層層剝削、及技術之不求改良、但外茶競爭之壓迫、實為更大之原因云云、繼為社會局代表吳桓如·市黨部代表毛雲等·演說、詞長從略、</p>

<p>仲秋的景物</p>
<h3>秋感</h3>
<p>— （雪文）</p>
<p>階前的幾叢綠草，彷彿禁不住這仲秋的風似的，已經流露出黯然的神情了。</p>
<p>牆角裏的蟋蟀，好像傷感的詩人似的，昑諷着，詠歡着，聲音是那麼悲涼而悽切！似乎是它心裏隱藏着無限的慘痛，發着不平的呼聲。</p>
<p>天空高高的，那末爽朗而淸澈，棉絮樣的白色的雲，成堆成片的在浮動着，變幻着，一會兒像飛禽走獸，一會兒又幻成山川，平地……</p>
<p>秋風掠過了大地，到處吹送着凄凉的氣息，吹過樹梢，吹過雲端，吹過高爽的天空。</p>
<p>燕子，這敏感的善測時季的北國的候鳥，歸去了！同着它的伴侶們。樑上的舊巢，是冷淸淸的空着，空着……</p>
<p>街上，永遠像黃昏的時分，入們深沉的在蠕動着，彷彿一切都罩上了一層滯鈍的影子缺乏活潑和生氣。</p>
<p>自己心裏的創痕，好像貓抓的，引起一縷縷的悵惘，對着這當前的景色，遐想到千里外的故鄉，幾年以前的舊事……</p>
<p>我陷入沉思中。</p>
<h3>撩人的月色</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>池裏殘荷，已無復翠蓋亭亭之　觀了。四周景物，亦殊凄淸只有池後遠遠地傳來琅琅的書聲，和那砌下蟲聲唧唧，若相應答。舉頭皓月當空，彷彿在促起人幻思似的。本來秋月最易引起行人們的遐想。「床前明月光，疑是地上霜；舉頭見明月，低頭思故鄉。」這是游子因對月而引起思家的心情的。「長安一片月，萬戶搗衣聲；秋風吹不盡，總是玉關情；何日平胡虜？良人罷遠征。」這是思婦因對月而挑　起眷念征夫的幻思的。人同此心，心同此理。於今學府之內，一般靑年男女們，對此撩人的月色，恐不免也要想起爹爹，媽媽，弟弟，妹妹或者心上人兒吧。</p>
<p>最可羨而又最可恨的，要推他校長夫婦倆。他們新婚不久，眞是朝朝美滿，夜夜甜蜜。平是手携着手，肩偎着肩，周巡於校內外，本已撩起靑年們的種種綺思，而那夜他們夫婦倆又並立池邊，耳鬢厮磨，喁喁情話了。鐘聲響後，退歸寢室，靑年們對此月色，對此儷影，心頭不免怦怦而動。少頃，遠遠地突然傳來「在天願為比翼鳥，在地願為連理枝」的高歌聲。這不知在詛咒着這一雙儷影呢，還是在禱祝他們月明缺月仍圓：那可無從索解哩。而他們倆呢，相顧微笑，禁不住狂吻一下，卽冉冉歸其住宅去了。</p>
<p>那夜，靑年們的夢中，非眷念着「林妹妹」卽憧憬着「寳哥哥」，和那校長夫婦倆夢裏微笑，酬和到天明。啊，這秋夜月色啊！當此情景，人們—尤其是靑年男女們—眞是撩撥不開，安頓不下啊！</p>
<h3>籬落呼燈</h3>
<p>— 禮澄</p>
<p>讀姜白石齊天樂咏蟋蟀詞，到了「笑籬落呼燈，世間兒女，」那兩句，心裏有許多威想，就把它寫在下面吧。　蟋蟀就是促織，本是秋蟲哪。頂好的是：白麻頭，靑絲額，油利撻，蟹殼靑，梅花翅，螂螳形，靑項，金翅…名色很多，都載在劉侗促織志。豳詩裏說：「…五月斯螽動股，六月莎雞振羽，七月在野，八月在宇，九月在戶，十月蟋蟀，入我床下，……」（周正建子，他的十月，就是夏歷八月）。所說的斯螽，莎鷄，蟋蟀，都是一物，不過隨時變化，名稱不同罷了。</p>
<p>我在兒時，最喜歡的，就是捉蟋蟀。每天放學回家，吃過了晚飯，也不騎竹馬，也不踢　子，也不拍皮毬，只和同屋的幾個小朋友，拿着竹筒，鐵絲罩，專門蹬在寂寞無人的菜園外，籬笆院子裏，壞牆脚邊，花臺子左右，靜悄悄的，只聽蟋蟀呌，曉得它在那個地方，就呼他們擦洋火，點洋燈，實行捉的工作，翻石頭，挖牆洞，「披荆斬棘」，鬧個不休。什麼蛇呀，蜈蚣呀，鬼呀，都不怕的。在那個時候，就是「無愁天子」，恐怕也沒有我的快活。</p>
<p>唉！日子過得眞快，兒童時期，已經過去了，籬下的秋蟲，也不得捉了，這是什麽緣故呢？說起來，自己也好笑，每天天亮爬起來，直到電燈來火，都是收發那些麻煩的文件，什麼送簽呀，送會呀，送判呀，送繕呀，送印呀，歸檔呀，一件一件的摘由，一件一件的消號，瑣碎的事，更僕難數。什麼興會，一點也沒有，吃過了晚飯，心裏只想躺籐椅了。總而言之，「往事不堪回首」！</p>
<p>本來古人的秋天作品，都是很好；詩的方面，就有秋閨怨，秋宮怨，秋興，秋思，…文的方面，也有宋玉的九辯，歐陽永叔的秋聲賦。但我總覺得不如老姜的蟋蟀詞有趣味，尤其是「籬落呼燈」這一句。</p>
<h3>多事之秋</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>秋天的茉莉</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>茉莉，相傳出自波斯國，今南方暖地皆植之；漢陸賈南行記。載「南越五穀無味，百花不香，獨茉莉不隨水土而變，」故產自閩廣者，榦粗莖勁，高可三四尺，有單瓣重瓣之別，唯江以南，有類藤蔓而叢生，長及丈餘，葉似茶而較大，則其異焉。茉莉名詞不一，本草與草木狀兩書，皆作「末利」，洛陽名園記作「抹厲」，佛經作「抹利」，王龜齡集作「沒利」，洪邁集作「末麗」，蓋紬繹「茉莉」二字，非中士語，隨人會意而定；楊愼丹鉛錄云：「晋書都人簪柰花，卽今茉莉，而東坡謂之暗麝」，有「暗麝着人簪茉莉」之句，殆以其芳香而云也。</p>
<p>花開，自初夏至秋末可不斷，其狀似小荷，而品最貴，名為「寳珠茉莉」，以花蕾初小如珠，而尤在秋陽驕烈之中，吐放香溢，益覺淸麗可愛，一至薄暮，滿院幽芳，雖遠能聞，不讓春蘭，植者隨時摘去嫩枝更易茂育，而蕊尤纍紫，性喜暖，日光愈足，花開愈盛，澆灌則以米泔水，或黃豆汁魚腥水亦宜，特須午後施之，否則冷熱不勻，反損生機。過此秋日，乃壅以肥土，藏於向陽之地，及春淸明後，方可移出；然仍畏東南風侵襲，與蟲蟻蝕其根鬚，皆當預為防護。黃梅時，若從節間摘斷，於相切處，嵌入大麥一粒，以亂髮纏之，扦揷於陰濕之所，其枝卽能生根，此栽植之簡法也。</p>
<p>有一種「紫茉莉」，亦名「狀元紅」，但婆娑而蔓衍易生，迨深秋時始著花，惜於晨間吐艷，至卓午而卽歛，香亦甚微，故不為人所重，縱能結實，徒有虛名耳；較之「茉莉」，而堪以為婦女首飾者，用綵絲穿花心，　之雲鬚，號曰「鬘華」，或稱「玉搔頭」者，遠已。「茉莉」之根，以酒浸之，令人麻醉，雖一杯不醒，亦其特性使然，不可輕嘗。廣東省志。「雷瓊二州，有黃茉莉。名黃馨」，不知是否「金茉莉」，則未敢斷言矣。</p>

<h3>滿覺隴訪桂記</h3>
<p>— 李絮非</p>
<p>杭州四時之　不同，宜其間經年游侶不絕於途。余三度居杭，性復喜遊湖汎花事，以逮獄會山盟，未嘗不踏破屐齒，碌碌休沐日也。滿覺隴在南山龍井這中，每屆秋風送爽，丹桂　香之日，遊人輒以萬計。今年花信偏早，得君章函的，遂以二十一日，相與君章夫人曁春陰女士一至其地。</p>
<p>遊滿覺隨者，皆首途湖濱，或以舟艤赤山埠，或以汽車抵四眼井，然後徒步里許，卽達其地。余等以是日下午往，湖濱一瞥，空巷萬人，傾城以出，新裝照眼者，皆為滿覺隴桂花忙也。</p>
<p>余等以人力車往，輕車緩出，容較汽車扁舟為勝一籌；而南山道上，已非山陰可比，油壁新車，塵揚十里，軗影人聲，喧比五都。余等掩口屛息，幾於哭笑不得，本為脫俗而來，却將載塵以歸，事之相去，胡可料哉？</p>
<p>滿覺隴迤邐里中，平時狹地荒村，此日滿坑盈谷，肩摩踵接，人語沸騰。然繁花盈盈枝上，濃香馥馥心頭，幾於令人入隴輒醉。沿隴人家，盡出坐臥什物，煮茶剝栗，爭緣為市。樹下墓地，今　壟斷，所謂幽明永隔，死生異趣者，其相去亦祗黃土數尺耳。</p>
<p>買座樹下，啜茗移時，黃白燦爛，爭似夕陽，香澤馨逸，揚以微　，山腰隴畔，幾於成林，色旣可餐，味且足飽，亦有幼童少女，高聲喚賣，採花盈掬，不値幾文，誠樵蘇之災，深桐焦之嘆矣，。更聞花事旣闌，居人則歛以製香餌，售諸餮饕，恃為歲計。已而暮色蒼暝，余等遂亦言歸，越四日乃為之記。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>夢蘭回房的時候，老媽子却送了一張字條進來，上回寫着是：「朋早六時請妹偕兄往石觀音庵同處讀書臺一帶散步。千萬勿誤。兄梧白。」夢蘭拿着這字條在手上，却不由得呆了一呆。大哥向來沒有約着一路出去過。尤其是這樣一大早，的我出去幹什麽？女僕見他兩隻眼睛，釘住了紙條，只管來回翻弄看。便道：小姐想着什麼，我怎麽去對大少爺說呢？夢蘭連連點頭道：我去的，我去的，你去告訴他罷？他這樣說着把女僕打發走了，可是心裏千元自狐疑着，究不知大哥為了什麽事。若照着他的為人說，恐怕又是抬出一篇大道理來，勸自己的婚事。好在這件事，自己有一貫的主張，倒不問哥哥怎樣的盤問，自己明天還是照着，板頭對付也不必胡想了。當時揭穿了也就安然的去睡覺。到了次日早上，自己怕悮了的，立刻披衣起床，隨便梳攏了一把頭髮。也不願驚動用人，自到廚房裏去倒水上來，擦過一把臉，就到前進屋子去會大哥。可是梧軒已有點等得不耐煩的樣子，兩手揷在　又袋裏，只管來回的在天井裏徘徊着。夢蘭到了面前，他才把臉上的憂容打破，舒着眉毛，透出一綫笑意來。因道：我們就去罷？天氣很好，正可以到那空曠的地方，去呼吸一點早上的新鮮空氣。夢蘭點了兩點頭，自跟着他走出去。在南京城的東南角上，有一大片空地，向來是莊稼人，在這裏種了菜園子。靠城牆脚的所在，雨花臺的支脈，伸了一個小阜進來。這小阜並不是土質的，却是整塊的大石頭，由土裏面有拱出來。（八三）</p>
<h3>太湖秋色</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>輪船出了胥口門，便是那汪洋三萬六千頃的太湖了一片波光，萬疊浪花，帆點冉冉，山影隱約，這偉大的太湖，像海，也像沙漠。</p>
<p>浪花一個一個的向船舷上捲過來，撞得我們的輪船也彷彿一頭受驚的牲口，它直暴跳地在奔着，使船中的乘客都驚駭得躱在艙角落裏哆嗦，有些胆小的女人，甚至哭喊嘔吐起來；全船中起了不平常的騷動，但在此千鈞一髮之際，我們除了將整個生命交付與船主外，又有什麽辦法呢！</p>
<p>許多帆影在這悠悠的烟波裏傾斜着移動，太陽却老躱在雲醫裏不敢露臉，雲山蒼蒼，湖水泱泱，那偉大的大自然呵！我願意就這樣地把自己的靈魂燬滅了，不再看見那汚濁的世界，萬惡的社會。</p>
<p>洞庭西山的全影已很淸晰地映人了眼簾；首先在船邊爬過的是黿頭渚隨後就是龜山，石公山。船進了廟山渚，便是消夏灣了；那裏不但波乎如鏡，而且淸澈見底，水面上浮滿了一片一片的老蓴菜葉子，芰荷的芬芳却從前而荷蕩裏飄過來，隱隱地夾着一種幽揚的歌聲，這歌聲是男人的還是女人的，却分不淸楚。</p>
<p>太陽已斜過了縹緲峯的山尖，在這遲暮夕暉裏，湖山如畫，水色平舖，遠處的鳥影，天邊的霞彩，一切山峯，一切樹林上全已披上了一襲金色的羽衣。</p>
<p>「落霞與孤鶩齊飛，秋水共長天一色。」此情此境，眞將疑自己已身入畫中了。尤其是那箕形的速綿山峯，重疊起伏，峻險崎嶇，與這美麗的湖光，溫柔的水色相輝映，儼如一位英雄相對一個美人。</p>
<p>消夏灣，相傳是吳王西施曾避暑此間，而「消夏漁歌」是洞庭八景之一，因為一進廟山渚，那兒一片全是魚池，荷蕩；每到夏天，不但氣候溫和，而且風景非常美麗。蕩那些年靑的漁人，男的，女的，他們手裏工作着，嘴上却自然而然的唱和起來，這歌聲輕輕地飄到岸上，在那個小小的漁村裏盪漾着，盪漾着。</p>
<p>那里有許多很好的土產，譬如，蓮蓬，藕，蒪菜，芰白，餛飩菱等；但是近年來那裏的漁人們，生活也非痛苦！蕩裏一年水大，水大了便不能捕魚，一年水小，水小就不可種菱。所以在從前大家都認為世外桃源的，如今却也成了人間地獄。</p>
<p>船穿過了幾重籪，從一片荷蕩傍邊進去，老荷葉在向我們　着腦袋，幾朵殘荷却低着了頭，似一個憔悴的嫠婦，在向人低泣一樣。遙望釗消夏鎭上，村人却在做晚飯了；一縷一縷的炊烟從那烏黑的屋脊上飛起來，逈繞在這週遭，像　一般的籠罩着，只剩了一個糢糊的輪廓。</p>

<h3>法郎貶值後的貨幣問題</h3>
<p>— 蔣潔</p>
<p>（一）法郎貶值的原因</p>
<p>這次法郎貶值以及金集團的瓦解，是早在英美金融界意料之中的。由於它不能適應國際的貨幣貶值戰而保持過高的金平價，因以招致經濟財政與金融的恐慌，根本上使金本位基礎發生動搖。（註一）可是這種情形，很早就存在了，何以在今日方始出於貶值之舉呢？這裏一定有它的重要近因在。據社會上一般的論調，都認為是西班牙問題所促成的，其實，尚不止此。依我們觀察，最近東南歐政局的變動，實為其直接原因。本來羅馬尼亞全賴法國的經濟扶助，而與南斯拉夫，捷克，同屬於和平陣綫的。但近年法國因堅持金本位之故，自身的經濟財政十分危難，無力他顧。德國乘此機會，伸張勢力，德財長沙赫德氏於四個月前巡遊多腦河流域，大施籠絡，而小協約國傾向於德國的態度，也就跟着明顯了。照歐洲的大勢來看，自從德奧協定成立，穗意間有了諒解以後，意國就默認德國的經濟勢力侵入東南歐，所以法西斯陣綫是日益鞏向起來了。法國處此情勢，自然受着極大的威脅，侷促難安。因此急欲聯合波蘭以制德。現在法波協定固已成立，但其協定之中，主要一項，卽須由法國以二十二萬五千萬法郞貸予波蘭。以法國今日的財政困難情形，何來此剩餘的巨欵接濟他人？所以法國如果再頑固地死守金本位，使全國上下焦頭爛額於不斷而來的金融恐慌，且不說它將如何遭受經濟上的犧牲，立卽法國的政治地位要保持不住了。當此「法國與法郞不可並存」的關頭，法郞貶值是不足驚異的。</p>
<p>同時，英美鑒於法郞的迭起恐慌，朝不保暮，旣遲早必須出於貶值之一途，而在此過渡時期，國際金融無日不在緊張對峙之中，各國貨幣政策俱採備戰的態度，各國中央銀行俱屯積金貨不使流通，馴至國際貿易無從發展，世界經濟無從恢復。正是貨幣戰爭到了大家感覺着痛苦的時候，一時又想協議休戰，所以英美應法國的要求，便成立了三國貨幣協定，英美允以實力援助法郞之改制，使法國無外顧之憂，這又是促成法郞貶值的一個重要近因。</p>
<p>（二）法參衆兩院的論爭</p>
<p>這次法郎貶值，在經濟上，政治上，以及在貨幣制度的規律上，原是勢所必然的。可是當法國參衆兩院討論政府所提出的新貨幣法案時，還引起激烈的論爭。中央派及右派對政府猛施攻擊，反對貶值。最後全案在參議院中，政府僅以十票之差，悻獲通過。可見法國國內阻撓貶值的力量，依舊不容忽視的這裏面人民的傳統，思想以及對於貨幣貶值的恐懼心理還在其决，而法國以農業為特性，並以金利生活者為中心的經濟機構，却是造成這種勢力的主要因素。（註二）</p>
<p>其實，法國政府為情勢所迫，旣　决心實施貨幣貶值，事實上也就難於挽回。所以这次左右派對於新貨幣法案的爭鬥，主要還在於條文的修正上。最初政府所提出的貨幣法案，大要如下：</p>
<p>（一）廢止一九二八年金本位貨幣法。此後法郞之法定價格，定在九成金〇，〇四三公分與〇，〇四九公分之間。較原來之九成金〇，〇六五五公分，計减值四分之一至三分之一之間。</p>
<p>（二）設立滙兌平準基金，由法蘭西銀行加以運用，目的在穩定貨幣。</p>
<p>（三）以新幣值計算，重行估定法蘭西銀行之存金價值，其所得盈餘一百三十萬萬法郞，大部份撥作匯兌平準基金。</p>
<p>（四）全國黃金收歸國有，並禁止金貨之輸入輸出與交易。</p>
<p>（五）調整工資，使與物價指數相適應。</p>
<p>兩院中對於這個法案的爭鬥，可說是集中在最後一條。本來工資與物價的調節適當與吾，關關於法國新貨幣政策的前途很大。如果物價沒有節制，勢必受貶值的刺激，逐步上漲，一旦物價上漲之程度相等於法郞貶值之程度，則法郞貶值對於國際貿易的利益便完全喪失。同時，工資與一般薪給不能與物價為比例的遞增，將使大衆生活不勝重負，成為法郞貶值的犧牲者，此後工潮的爆發，更是無可避免的。但如把工資提高，則生產成本增加，物價亦隨之上昇，依舊陷人同樣的危險。所以節制物價是必要的，而實業家的熊虔恰恰與此相反，他們不願意物價受嚴格的束縛，致妨礙利潤的獲取。在這一點上，資本家的利益和工人的利益很難調協得當。因此這個議案在兩院中便衝突起來了。第一步在衆議院內成立妥協，勃倫總理允予取消議案中「遂步增高工資」的規定，而代以「授權政府防止物價高漲」的條文。可是這個修正案依舊不能通過於參議院，最後成立折衷方案，規定「如因貨幣貶值，而生活程度提高，以致引起社會糾粉之時，得由政府用强制裁法解決之，惟十前應先徵求全國經濟委員會只同意。」根據這個方案，公然的痛苦要等到物價漲至社會發生糾紛時，方才考慮得到，可知資本家的利益依舊占着優勢的。</p>
<p>此决方案通過以後，政府發布了二件和物價問題有密切關聯的命令，一件是减低關係，此舉使物價上漲受一打擊，一件是禁止物價無理抬高。者樣，或者可以綏和勞資間的衝突。不過在事實上，物價上漲是不可避免的，所「無理的抬高」，它的界限很難判別，這是可以顧慮的。十月四日巴黎西部有大規模的共黨示威運動，顯然與此事有關。</p>
<p>其次，新貨幣法案中一度成為爭點，而值得我們注意的，便是法郎貶值的程度沒有明確的規定，而僅僅規定一個貶值的範圍，卽是從四分之一到三分之一之間。這是給政府保留將來繼續貶價的餘地，法國得以運用貨幣政策對付國際經濟戰。此與從前美比諸國的情形相同，美國常初規定貶值限度為百分之五〇至百分之六〇，嗣後確定於百分之五九。〇六。比利時當初規定貶值的限度為百分之七〇至百分之七五，嗣後確定於百分之七十二·（註三）現在法國政府還沒有把這一點確定下來，九月三十日法蘭西銀行售予英蘭銀行的法郎匯價為每英鎊合九十六法郎，到十月五日已跌至〇五·四一法郞，因此資金四流，尚未見之事實。但據倫敦金融界觀察，法國政府不久必將確定貶價之程度，而且確定的一點，將接　於最大的乏直限度，吏以後勺法郎價格減少變動的範圍，以穩定貨幣制度，則法國在外資金，便可回流。</p>
<p>（三）法郎貶值的影響</p>
<p>法郎貶值以後，對於法國國內的影響如何，管理問題是極關重要的。如果管理得當，金融安定，使資金回流動確實的利益可得，同流便立卽見之事實，而法國此時正需要大量資金以作發展經濟之用，得此自然大有功效。此後法國的物價與生產，將漸决上昇，對外貿易與對外收支，將漸决改善，因而財政獲　出路，使多年凋敝的法國經濟，可以一時昭蘇。但如管理失當，金融不能安定，政局依舊動盪，或者因勞資衝突而引起重大的工潮，則法國資金可以仍舊留置國外，國內經濟依舊不能復興。照現在看來，這種情形富不致實現。</p>
<p>至於右派議員對於政府的攻擊，把這次法郎貶值比作歐戰后金融恐慌的再見，這是過甚其辭的。戰後法國人所以受法郎暴跌，通貨膨脹的痛苦者，原因在於它的無計劃，無準備，無嚴密管理。現在的情形，與此大不相同。</p>
<p>但是照法國當局的看法，認為法郎貶值以後，經濟繁榮，好像可以一勞永逸的樣子，這種樂觀態度，也是沒有根據的。在長時期內，法國所能從貶值獲取的利益也是很有限的，在今日全世界俱已貶值的局面中，法國祗能從貶值免除了歷年所遭受貨幣上的犧牲，却不能像以前的英美一樣，從貶值獲取國際的優勢。這不僅法國為然，一切謳歌貨幣貶值為「萬應靈膏」者，俱應深自覺悟，作如是觀。</p>
<p>現在我們回頭看看法郎貶值對於國際的影響如何呢？第一件，就是國際間匯兌關係的變更，瑞士荷蘭之緊隨法國而實施貶值，原在吾人意料之中的。繼瑞荷之後，希臘，拉特維亞，捷克，意大利諸國，俱已相繼貶值。德國政府此事隨聲明不變金融政策，但結果不免出於貶值之途。因為德國所採取的統治貿易與統治外匯等政策，已使經濟陷於孤立地位，難於持久。</p>
<p>可是這些國家在貶值之後，貨幣地位是不能夠孤立的。必得在英美之間擇一聯繫。目前，荷·瑞·希·拉特·奧·土·諸國俱　加入英鎊集團，所以此後的關鍵，仍繫與英美的動止。倘美英不能調協，而採取報復的貶值競爭，則各國貨幣，都要陷入混亂局面，世界經濟無異地要受極大的打擊。以英美今日卽得優勢之地位，當不願出此。所以這次法郞貶值，事前卽已成立三國貨幣協定，以防止此種不幸之局面，並山英美法同時發出宜言，保持匯兌平衡，促進和平，又邀請其他國家，加入合作。吏去國得以從容整理咸低關稅，並向全世界發出减低關稅壁壘的呼籲。這的確算得國際貨幣史上的創舉，而是一九三三年世界經濟會議所夢想而不能達到的境地。</p>
<p>我們分析這次三國貨幣協定的內容，可以看出它們在久戰之後，已經有了一種覺悟，知道貨幣戰爭是並非單在貨幣的領城裏所能完全解决的，它的基本原因，站有現代國家主義的經濟政策之上，「要求貨幣的安定，必須在各種經濟制度中成立永遠的平衡後，方能獲得，所以國際經濟關係，應作進一步的改善，」這是法國所提出，而為英美所歡迎的。是以繼協定之後，十月七日由英法兩國向國聯經濟委員會建議减除國際貿易的障碍，勸各會員國實地並　連廢除目下的貿易限額制與匯兌統制。這不能說全無誠意。但須籲到，現代經濟制度裏遺有根本的矛盾在，永遠的平衡是近乎理想的。有　　人抱着過份的樂觀，認為世界貨幣平衡已計日可待，一且平衡達到，世界各國將協議使貨幣制度重復以黃金為基礎，建立長久的和平　　若協定前途，可以暢行無阻，這種推斷，尚嫌過早。我們該注意，英國貨幣當局會屢决申說：英鎊價值除了對金集團貨幣以外，對世界其他各國貨幣俱嫌過高。現在不唯金集團已實施貶值，歐洲許多國家俱已相繼貶值，英國對此能吾容忍，而休止它　向的鎊價　减政策，此時尚不可知。　此外，英美之間也並非全無問題，據九月二十七日巴黎電訊，英國主張將現值抑至每　鎊合美金四元　角，而美國則堅持不得低於四元九角九分，現信雙方讓步，使鎊價上落於一元八角至九角之間，一時當不致引起嚴重的衝突。同時英美兩力，都發出同樣的　明，否認英鎊與　元間，已嚴　規定外匯的比價，蛛絲馬跡，都是將來世界貨幣糾紛的伏筆。</p>
<p>不過就事論事，以一國貨幣協定為前奏的法郞貶值事件，它在國際間的影響，很多可以稱道的。</p>
<p>為國際間金貨的流通。　從法郎發生恐慌以來，　藏之風甚熾，以致黃金受種種束縛，不能作為通貨準備以及國際貿易支付之用。現在法郎問題旣已解决，窖藏黃金當可大量叶出，加以年來黃金的凈增加額，十分可觀，一日流通以後，世界貿易與物價自可欣欣向榮。以前美國是禁金出口的，（對金本　國除外）很久期間，形成黃金自歐洲到美國一面流的形勢。法郎貶值以後，美國已開始考慮接觸金禁的問題。至於法國在外資金的流回本國，得以帮助經濟展，還是次要的問題。</p>
<p>其次為世界金價的上升。金集團貶值以後，鎊價要相對的跌落，因此　英鎊計算的倫敦金價便見上升，現時世界金價以倫敦為準，故而各國金價俱將漲起，幣值還要相對的低落，間接予世界物價以復興之機會。</p>
<p>但金價如果陡然漲起過高，貨幣常然失其穩定，為害反大。在這一點上，英國是有力足以抑止的。第一，英法美三國間已訂立協定，幣值不得過跌，且此時美國的金價並沒有變動，依舊為每　三十五元。第二，英國滙兌平準基金處一向買進的黃金十分富足，卽使法國資金回流，引起英鎊的賣風，該處可以拋出黃金，吸進英鎊，給金價上升以一種抵制的力量。所以現在一百四十一先令左右的倫敦金價，一時不致再超出過遠的。</p>
<p>上海標金市塲亦受法郞貶值的影響，上週間（九月二十六日至十月二日）金價飛漲，計自九月二十五日的一千一百二十七元漲至十月一日最高的一千一百六十三元，漲風之烈，開新貨幣政策實施以來的創見。其實，這裏面並非楚單受法郞貶值後倫敦金價漲起的刺激所致。同時還由法郞貶值影響外滙的變動；加以目前時局緊張，帶起吾國貨幣上的傳說。投機者乘時鼓動，金價便扶搖回上。可是貨幣上的傳脫，終究要冷下來的，而倫敦金價業已穩定於一白四十　先令左右，上海　金價便漸　回落，　月五日已落至一千一百五十三元。此後上海　金價格若有何重大上落，則與倫教金價無甚　係。</p>
<p>其次，法郞貶值對於國際間富際　兌市塲的影響。也並不算壞。除了九月二十六日倫敦外匯市場完全停頓以外，此後各地滙市俱已開出，十月二日起，對法滙價亦　開出。</p>
<p>中國方面，滙兌交易一直沒有停止，對法滙率則由向來的每中國百元台四五五法郞左右的匯價升至十月五日的六三〇法郎。同時對英滙率趨鬆，對美滙率　緊，這是英美間滙兌跌落的當然結果，不足為異。至於這幾大外滙交易的旺盛，那是　有原因的。</p>
<p>總括的說：這次法郞貶值的過程及其影響，是以可滿意的。　是世界整個的貨幣前途，不能够單單法郞貶值事件裏估計出來的。</p>

<h3>德意志經濟計劃的檢討</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>（一）四年新經濟計劃</p>
<p>這一次德國在舉行國社黨大會時，希特勒又宣佈第二次四年新經濟計劃，企圖再經過　年的努力，德國所需要的工業原料，完全可脫離國際而能够獨立。這個計劃，我們如果把過去四年德國的努力情形，在經濟方面所獲得的成就看來，那麼在未來的四年之中定會有更多的成就而並不是虛空的妄想。的確，戰後的德國，他們的經濟情形早已有岌岌不可終日之勢，而迄於今日，德意志的能夠復興，國內經濟情形已見安定不少。我們對於德國人的努力，不能不表示相當的佩服，而所謂第二度的四年經濟計劃，更當然有如期完成的可能。雖然，一般的人都知道德國原料的缺乏，牠的殖民地更沒有恢復戰前的原狀，但德國人的勇往直前，努力奮鬥，又焉能預料其在未來四年之中，不會有更多的成就呢？</p>
<p>（二）過去四年的成績</p>
<p>我們如果把過去四年德國經濟建設的成就，根據國際貿易局的報告，那麼，德國的經濟請形，的確已有特殊的進步。在德政府指導之下，國民正在為經濟自給而努力，農業的進步，軍費的鉅大，以及工務方面疾速進行，一切的一切，都可反證德過的經濟情形已比往年安定得多。不過另一面，我們也不否認德國的工　直到現在還是感到本國原料的缺乏，他的新政策是依照目前所需要的一切而確定的，但另一面還是不違反國社黨對於德國的經濟情　和工商業所抱的態度，卽根據國社主義，全德意志的各種活動，要加以統制，凡是原料進口的國家，營進出口的商人，乃至一般的工人怎樣的工作，都是取决於國社黨的。所有加入「勞工陣線」的工人，更全是國社黨中比較舒服的黨員。</p>
<p>（三）農業的驚人發展</p>
<p>關於經濟方面，劃分為五類，就是農業，工業，手工業，運輸業，和「勞工陣綫」。其中最進步的一種是農業，因為國社黨以為鄉村住民的健全不但在經濟方面具有相當的重要，且在政治房間業可產生一種反共的偉大力量。所以他們制定七十萬塊農田，在任何情狀之下，不得作為抵押品的：使所有的農民，都由都市中趕同農村去，抬高麥價，使農民有力淸償債務，所以德國目前的麥價，比任何世界市塲來得高，把巨大地的產劃分開來，使小地主都可有力，收買，同時，更力使佃農都成小地主而自己有田種。結果，德國的　農，便很疾速的由一九三二年的二二三，〇〇〇人而减至一九三五年的五二，〇〇〇人；同時，德國的農民，在此四年之中，所淸償的債務也有五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇金鎊。國社政府更力使全德農民採取科舉的方法來耕種，據說德國的農民，目前五人之中，有四人已接通電力，可是在美國，八人之中，祗有一人；結果，全德所需的食物，目前百分之八十已可自給了。</p>
<p>（四）工業原料的缺乏</p>
<p>我們進一步看到德國近年來進出口的統計，那麼德國所進口的除了對英國以外，大部份是超過出口的。德國對英出口的似乎比向英國進口的來得多，而德國向英國進口的，大半是羊毛，棉花和煤等等。各種工業原料，進口的超過與出口距離過遠了，使德國對於國際貿易，不能不採取一種新政策。我們知道目前德國的國際貿易百分之六十已由政府直接統制，而百分之二十是由政　所認可的商人經營的。德國在理想中的經濟自給，唯一的困難，就在原料的缺乏。全國所需要的脂肪，德國自己出產的，祗有一半，鐵礦不及百分之二十，羊毛和各種棉織原料不到百分之十，大豆，豆餅，菜油等不到百分之四，至於棉花，大麻，黃麻，絲，橡皮，松香和蟲膠中等等，竟不到百分之一。為補救上面所說各種原料的缺乏起見，德政府正在力促下面各種計劃的疾速現實。植物油的產量，正在力使加多，而捕鯨事業也在力圖擴展之中；乳油的產量，也增加了，單就政府所統制的牛塲，本年度的乳油產量，已可由二，三五〇加侖加到三，七〇〇加侖了；為使羊毛的產量加多起見，全國所畜的綿羊，已由三百五十萬頭增加到千萬頭；由亂羊毛製成的混合織物原料，正和混合樹膠，混合汽油一樣，早已在出貨了。同時，國社黨方面，更促使全國人民忘懷了私人的利益，而為國家努力，以促整個經濟計劃的實現。</p>
<p>（五）失業工人的減少</p>
<p>國社黨對於內政方面，一個重要的政策，就在力使國內失業人數的减少，而這個政策，目前也已獲得相當的成效。據說本年七月，全德失業的人數又减少了一四四，〇〇〇人，而結果失業的人們，總共祗有一，一七〇，〇〇〇人了。最近德國失業人數不斷的减少，會使我們看出數字方面，已和一九二八與一九二九年的黃金時代差不多了。國社黨的發言人早已在對實業界下警吿了說是工人的缺乏，不久就要成為事實了，所以每一個工廠應得充分的去利用機器，俾可節省人工。因為單就玩具畫匠說來，各廠所需要的新工人已超過失業者登記的四〇〇，〇〇〇人的數字了。的確，自希特勒握柯之後，到而今失業的人數，已减去了六百萬，而且我們更可找出不少有力的證據。第一，有職業的人，本年五月，全德已有一七，五五〇，〇〇〇人，和一九三三年一月比較之下，多過六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人，另一面所减少的失業的人數，也超過一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人以上，我們如果把全盛時代的一九二八年，全個德國有業的總共一八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇人相形之下、也是差得不遠了。第二，在德國目前技巧的工人，盛到極度的缺乏，更是一件極明顯的事情。因此，有甚多工廠，對於這種工人都在出了較高的工薪多方挖取。第三，國社黨方面雖然主張把工薪普遍减低，等到失業問題完全得獲解决而止，可是一般的工人，工薪還是在加多之中，有一家工廠，不久治前，會宜佈將把全廠的職工普遍加薪百分之十。在德國關於工人的强迫作工，不準自由，以及所有關於經濟方面的產物和僱工的受國家統制，又是　件有趣的事情。我們知道目前做替工和獲得救濟的工人全德有二〇〇，〇〇〇人，所有每天得到一部分工作的人為了原料的缺乏，每星期紙做二十小時至三十六小時的工作。另一面，國社主義者在同人表示，說是失業問題早已獲到解决了，目前全德失業的人數之中，至少有五〇〇，〇〇〇人，是在更換職業，所以他們的失業是臨時的，不久就可獲得工作。還有部分是為了身體上或心理上患了病，所以不能作工。後面的一種，當然要歸入社會問題而需求人們的救濟的。據德國勞工部畏所向入表示者，那磨自本年九月一，僱主添招工人的時候，沒有領到人聲明書的人　概不准　用，　是有職業的或是有一技之長，堪以受人僱　的，才得向當局　領此種證書。這樣一來，今後在德國關於工人的受僱與解僱，當然要被政府更嚴密的監視着了。</p>

<h3>女子的天癸早至與反常</h3>
<p>……未至成熟期而月經突然湧至易罹虧弱和神經的病根　……貧血病和先天不足及神經衰弱者為月經反常的主因　……做丈夫的如發現妻子有此種病症應速根治以免小姙</p>
<p>康健的女子月事正常，行經時不感任何不快，或者僅覺輕微的不適，盆骨處因血的聚集有點發滿罷了，不應有任何虛弱或疲敝，縱或微失正常亦宜列入月經病中。</p>
<p>月經病雖然平常視為體用上的症候，然而是根於體組織，或器官情形內在的困難，倘不顧及全體，僅為局部治療，不能作為良好的辦法。</p>
<p>天癸早至——月經有時在靑春期以前，突然米潮，那就易使女孩孱弱，其原因由於發育太早，或者由於環境的人或同玩的小孩引誘她使她對於性能早加注意，或者被人敎導犯過手淫，在這種情形以下，她的春情發動太早，若不為照顧，並且加以約束的話，這幼女恐怕從此種下虧弱和神經的病根。</p>
<p>月經反常——遭種現象，在失去健康的女子，差不多普遍罹患，如息有貧血病，和先天不足，也是月經反常的原因。消化系有病，糖尿症，神經衰弱症，也是月經反常的因素，總之，婦女的月經一旦反常，健康的幸福也隨之剝削。因為健康女子的月經决不會起變化的，假若突然增多，或者過分稀少，甚至兩月一來，以及一月數决，統謂之反常，應速施以治療，不可大意忽視。</p>
<p>做丈夫的如一旦發現妻子有這樣的毛病，應該起來嚴密注意，為妻的也要向丈夫陳述，不可隱瞞，因為道非但有損健康而且定會息不姙症無疑，將來子嗣艱難，家庭毫無樂趣，甚至夫婦反目。</p>
<p>關於治療，自德國著名婦科專家修泰拿哈博士倡導應用生殖腺素製劑女　「生殖素」以來，世界各國學者多來響應，因服用簡便，同時見效確實。此製劑誠為婦女界的福音，僅僅內服二三盒，月經馬上調整，便覺精神爽快，睡眠優良，容貌，皮膚，氣力皆呈活潑向榮狀態，此誠名實相符的良藥也。</p>

<p>（二）淫慾過度之根本治療</p>
<p>患者賈鴻良，年卅二歲，安徽合肥人，主訴——十年前好作狎邪遊，外室甚多，恣意縱慾，的二年已感不支，體亦漸褻，然尚不知自檢，在放如故，再三年後，擬卽懸崖勒馬，而已罹惡疾，血枯神衰，面黃肌瘦，鬢髮花白，目眩耳鳴，背曲腰酸，在在衰老，不禁駭絕，偶行房事，更萎疲無能，病歷——縱慾凡五年，幼時更有手淫之新傷，故現年祇三旬餘，蒼老如翁，衰頽難堪，請治，現在症——生殖腺巳衰老失却活力之滋養，性神經更萎頓麻痺，治療方法——投以大量生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以促進生殖腺之健全，繁殖新鮮細胞，增强內分泌之滋養，同時更施行電療手術，以刺激性神經回復原有機能，悉心治療二月，此將成癆瘵之患者方獲康健，且面色紅潤，精力勃勃，回復壯年氣槪矣。</p>
<p>白帶自療</p>

<p>子嗣艱難</p>
<p>天津法租界馬信誠君來函云：幼時手淫過度，更兼先天不足，以致性力薄弱，婚後五年，迄未生育，今春至申由詹念曾醫師悉心治療，並割除包皮，內服『生殖素』，即得發育充足，腎部有力，內子亦已懷孕四月矣。</p>
<p>偽藥害人</p>
<p>南京中山路孫思　君來函云：余因早年冶遊過度，身體因此虧憊異常，後卽捫心自惕，專心治療，於夏初購得『生殖素』三盒，察係紙盒瓶裝，服後毫無效力，方知假藥，乃購鐵盒之眞正『生殖素』四盒，所患之陽萎及早洩症一掃而盡，且余之體重增加，精神充足，確係該眞正鐵盒『生殖素』冉造之恩。</p>
<p>乳峯不高</p>
<p>嘉興張壁女士來函云：余因發育不全乳峯異常萎　，且身體已感衰弱，旋由同學彭女士介紹服女用『生殖素』之後，情形大異，不但乳峯高聳而體已增强</p>

<h3>早期衰老的防止</h3>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>……肉體與精神須奴方兼顧　……生理家的努力始吿成功</p>
<p>在本問題未加討論之前，應先將主宰人體康健的生殖腺有闡述的必要因人們的永久壯健及早期衰老，純為生殖腺壯健與萎頹之故原因由於人體內部的生殖細胞，位置於生殖腺內。生殖腺如能旺盛，則生殖細胞受其滋潤，欣欣向榮，同時新陳代謝的機能促進，而骨骼，筋肉，皮膚，毛髮，腦力，精神也顯出異常活潑狀態，反之，則呈枯萎憔悴現象，此即未老先衰之謂也。</p>
<p>生殖腺何以會呈衰弱？此無疑為不知攝生之故，如早年期的手淫，婚後之房事過度，及生性浪漫，感染淋病等等，均為生殖腺旺盛的致命傷。此外如病後失調，及先天性的孱弱，都為促成早期衰老的主因。一九二三　，自法國著名的生理學家白里司博士首先用生殖腺素製劑治愈一早期衰老之女子後，於是歐美學者都一致利用，最近奧國生理學家斯丹那氏的『生殖素』大為各國名醫所贊美，蓋期丹那氏所發明的『生殖素』較一九二三年法國白里司所用的生殖腺素製劑進步百倍，它不但能使肉體的衰老變為紅潤，而同時精神的衰老亦歸消滅，故精神强壯，腦力充足，思想也就活潑了，可使疾病不侵，壽命延長，對於婦女亦有同樣效力，故歐美女子，時藉此女用製劑而挽回其消逝的靑春，無怪靑年女子一致認為駐顏術的絕妙良藥。</p>

<p>在從前戒煙所以不能戒絕的原故，實在因為沒有萬全的良劑，所以大都懷疑不前，這也是的確的事實。試想一個體疲力衰的人，完全要藉煙力來維持他的生命，假使沒有勝過煙力的補劑使身體强壯，要想戒絕，如何可能呢？不過照醫理上講，吸煙人的身體所以比常人來得衰弱，並且非煙力不足振奮精神的原因，是因為吸煙人的體內生命源泉之生殖腺已受煙毒的損傷，使它不能有新陳代謝的作用，內分泌亦失却正常，原有的抵抗能力已完全消滅。假使沒有强有力的專藥以資生長抗毒素，而恢復生殖腺的康健，的確是很難如願戒絕的。</p>
<p>奧國生理學家斯丹那氏，卽根據此醫理而發明培補戒煙一法，不啻創造一支進攻煙毒之生力軍，該法卽用生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』培補恢復其原有健全的生殖腺，旺盛其內分泌，繁榮其新鮮細胞，促進有力的抗毒素。同時若再注射『育維賜保命』，則更有迅速之效力，百戒無爽，萬試萬靈，今夏有沈慶隆君投余戒煙，彼已試戒三次，總因痛苦難忍，以致毫無效果，故擬終老黑籍矣，詛意近來禁令森嚴，不得不戒，後經余用培補戒煙法，投以大量之鐵盒眞正『生殖素』，二月而安全戒絕，體亦轉壯，出其意外云。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>骨痛最進步的療法</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>體質素弱者尤易罹患　縱慾無度者本症難免</p>
<p>關於骨痛一症，在體質素弱的及縱慾無度者允易罹患。秋冬兩季比較春夏來得鄭重而猖獗，此外對於時令也有特別的關係，每有患者在平時痛苦較輕，一到交節或天陰時候，那末病勢就顯得異常劇烈。在久困於骨痛的患者，當能感到！一致認為難治的症候。不過患者如能依最進步的療法，試服『强斯登氏骨痛片』能在數小時之內：顯其效力——骨節輕鬆，腰背爽適，同時精神頓呈活發狀態，全世界的骨痛專家，都不否認，無不推崇美國强斯登氏發明的偉大，余在一百次試騐之中，竟得九十二人根治，其餘人人病槪減輕，故該藥的功效，使余深信不疑，患者徐子福，壯年時斷於色慾，曾患花柳病，以故血份混濁，而罹骨痛，廿年來遇節必發，天陰必痛，治亦無效，後經余用『强斯登氏骨痛片』三瓶而治愈，三年來未曾一發。</p>
<h3>性器短小及陰萎早洩的治療</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　張君實著</p>
<p>……本症以後天性較先天性為多手淫淋病為其主要原因　……最近歐美的著名專門學者都採用生殖腺的根本療法　……在國外以猶太商人患此病最多國人患此者觸目皆是</p>
<p>本來男女生殖器一到春情發動期，即十五六歲時，急速的發育，道是一般的現象。但也有雖然達到成年期而仍不發育，依然極其短小的。</p>
<p>關於此點，可從兩方面來說：其一，自己的生殖器雖不短小，却自己階於神經衰弱，只覺着好像是短小一樣，於是非常悲觀。其一，實際上確是發育不全，甚至好像小兒一樣。</p>
<p>發育不全的原因是什麼呢？這是因為：在靑春期中，為了生殖腺內分泌有了毛病；因而妨碍性器發育的時候雖然也有，但這樣的先天性的短小患者總是少數，多數仍為後天性者。</p>
<p>所謂後天性生殖器短小，乃是在靑年期；因為不自然的手淫及新婚時的房事過度，或因為惡性的淋疾等，使攝　腺受了異常的刺　。結果，睪丸以及其他內分泌機能成為不良，常常遺精，夢遺，早洩，而勃起力减退或不能勃起。接着，便成為陽委與短小，而陷於性的神經衰弱之中。</p>
<p>許多患此病的人們，因為與神經衰弱症合併，被極度的悲觀，恐怖，不眠，雜念以及强迫觀念等所支配，而對前途絕望，遂使病勢更加厲書。但是，無論怎樣，本病雖名為難治，亦决非不治之症。</p>
<p>最近歐美的著名專鬥學者，都採用下列的三種療法：（一）發育不全，早洩，陰萎及一切性神經衰弱等症，用眞正的生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」治療。（二）夢遺，遺精及滑精等，用「希米脫氏固精片」以鞏固遺精。（三）如有惡性淋病，那末利用黃色素和伐克辛合製「安敵淋」，故其功效顯著，並且絕無副作用。從來一般醫生對本病多應用感流電氣和手流電氣等。而據我的絕騐，電療雖亦有用處，但不能作為主要的療法，為什磨呢？因為：電氣治療是只行於表面，並不出於按摩（Massage）的效果以外。但是，本病因生殖腺的衰弱所致，故必須澈底根本的療法，以『生殖素』為主，則效力持久而顯易，我在德十數年，曾藉此治愈患者逮七千以上，其中以猶太人佔多數，回國後，綜計已有萬餘之上，誠為對症良藥也。</p>
<p>自療常識</p>
<h3>最經濟可靠的治淋法</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>性喜冶遊者的感染淋病，已成為不可逃避的事實。所以我們做不正當性交後，應該履行下列的簡易檢騐，法取一乾凈透明玻璃杯，直接採取自己的尿；靜而觀之，其尿中雖然無膿，但若有稍稍透明雲絮片漂浮在上面的時候，那就是已經感染淋病的證據，卽應速內服德國著名醫學博士傑特生發明的黃色素和伐克辛合製劑的『安敵淋』，此種優良的白濁特效藥，不但治愈甚速，而且永遠除根，不遺後患。</p>
<p>醫學進步的國家，如德，意，奧，英，法，美都利用黃色素和伐克辛合製劑「安敵淋」每年以减少數十萬的　病忠者，且效果確實，又符於簡效經濟原則，故對於患者肉體上精神上的利益實大。</p>
<p>一般找醫生診治之患者，十中八九已發現排膿及自覺症狀；所以不能短期治愈，誠屬一件憾事！現在患者即可利用此偉大可靠的「安敵淋」以收短期治愈的功效，且因藥力的能透膜殺菌，又能增加全身抗毒菌苗，對於急性慢性及一切併發病，無往而不利。淋病眞是可怕的疾病！但患者若照上述方法自療，恐怕不出一星期，就能完全斷根了。余近年來藉此劑根治患者達數萬以上，從未失敗。故敢推薦。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>倫敦人的新玩意</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>「到自然去！」這口號在歐美曾風行過一時，引導不少好奇的男女，實行起裸體運動。其實要到自然去，僅僅脫掉衣服，還是不够的，必需一切都回復原始生活，才算澈底。近據報傳消息：倫敦附近萊克斯登地方，發現一奇怪團體，以「還我自然」相標榜，此團體人數共二十八名，自耕自食，分居木造小屋，夜燃蠟燭，食物只限於野菜菓物，衣服只限於棉布木棉，日出而作，日入而息，過其極端簡易的生活，據一團員語人：「余等旣非共產主義者，亦非異人，以現代文明生活，太不自然，人為的虛偽太多，故營此原始生活，還我自然」。這不能不說是一種新玩意。</p>
<p>現代文明生活，委實有許多缺陷，呌人要感覺煩厭。什麼是現代文明生活的缺陷？凡生活在現代文明社會的人，尤其是過都市生活的，大家都能體騐到。「太不自然，人為的虛僞太多，」那是顯然的事實。因此有一部份不堪其苦的，便相率到自然去。像萊克斯登地方的奇怪團體，不願受現代文明生活的支配，在郊外共營「日出而作日入而息」的原始節單生活，以達其「還我自然」的理想，這正充分說明現代文明生活的破產！</p>
<p>然而時代潮流是向前進展的，社會旣由古代進化到現代，人類生活應隨時代而轉變，才是適存之道。若背逆潮流，大開倒車，不但是事實所不容許，且亦愚笨得可笑。例如近來歐美人喊出「到自然去！」不過一時厭倦文明生活，才想換換口味，嘗試一下自然生活，未必眞有長久享受原始生活的意思。倫敦附近這一以「還我自然」相標榜的團體，便是這道理。</p>
<p>其實眞正的文明生活，是可賓貴的，虛僞的文明生活，才呌人咒詛！而現代文明生活，是後者而非前者，所以露出不少缺陷。但我們要改良生活，正當的方法，是打倒虛偽的文明，而創造眞正的文明。若回復原始生活，是不合理的。因為現代文明生活，雖為我們所不滿，原始生活，更為我們所不歡迎。「到自然去！」這恐怕只是一種時髦的口號而已。</p>
<h3>騎馬到校塲去（續）</h3>
<p>大家像木鷄一樣不知所措的時候，堂兄和一個馬夫講妥了，我們五個人由他帮着打出了重圍。其餘落選的同伴就聯合着用最粗野的難聽的話罵那個馬夫的母親，姐妹，甚至祖奶奶，十七八代。</p>
<p>那個馬夫却是異常高興，他引着我們跑在前面去牽他的馬匹，嘴裏也還罵着，「你媽媽年紀大，入你的妹妹！」</p>
<p>但是那些同伴中的一個跳上一個士墩，首領似的發問？</p>
<p>「入誰的妹妹？」</p>
<p>「入馬阿大的妹妹！」一個聯合的回答。</p>
<p>粗野的笑聲要炸裂這片荒郊一樣。</p>
<p>馬阿大似乎屈服了，牽通五匹馬來，讓我們上了馬，默默地撤開二腿在後面跟着，他或許還是很得意地在計算着今晚回家去打一瓶酒喝個痛快吧。</p>
<p>跑過孔廟，果然有二個荷槍的兵站在門前。我們就由堂兄的一騎在先到校塲去了。校塲是前淸操兵的所在，同時也做殺犯人的刑塲，但是現在旣不操兵，也沒有犯人在那裏喊「二十年後又是一條好漢」！對着一片望不到邊際的大草地，五區馬整齊地並立着，互相投了個眼色，跑回路了。在馬背上大家都沒有開口，他們又威到名勝之區給予的失望太大了吧。</p>
<p>跑過放馬的地方，那個首領的馬夫又喊起來；</p>
<p>「入誰的妹妹？」</p>
<p>自然又是聯合着的「入馬阿大的妹妹！」</p>
<p>我聽見馬阿大罵了一聲「不要臉的」！</p>
<p>到水閘橋我們下了馬，因為城廂裏是不准坐馬的，堂兄給了馬阿大一塊錢</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>，他千恩萬謝地牽着馬走了。</p>
<p>我預料他回去一定還要受同伴們一次聯合的侮辱。</p>
<h3>到佘山去</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>（本報特寫）佘山是江南九峯之一，和松江相隔十二里。山上有天主教堂，每年五月，堂中舉行一次盛大的迎聖母典禮，遠近教友都要先後到山上去祈禱。但是到佘山去祗有水路可通，並且坐船要多走六里路，往返不甚便利。松滬長途汽車主人殷石笙先生在松泗路（松江到泗涇）通行之後，就在磚橋站再開闢一條支路直達佘山，已於雙十節通車，並招待上海新聞界前往參觀。</p>
<p>是日上午十時在滬閔長途車站專車迎候，記者隔夜雖然睡得甚遲，還是很高興起了個早，因為常年在都市中過生活，能有機會到鄉村去旅行一次，直達佘山。沿途的田地里，迎風飄着櫐櫐的稻　，豐收是有望了，鄉下人的臉上多掛着難見的笑容，希望那些米商做做好事，在新　登場的時候，不要故意操縱才好。—</p>
<p>車站上紮着一所彩牌樓，圍着許多觀閑的鄉下人。我們下了車，在人的甬道中到招待室里——那是沿着車站兩旁新建的平屋，每邊有一二十間，將來都是預備開商店的。先我們到的有山上的牧師，和松地新聞界等數十人。剛坐定主任就招呼我們午飯了，菜餚雖然很豐富，一方面獨自果然亦餓，又想多一點遊玩的時間，都匆匆吃了飯。到佘山來，當然要到山上去巡禮一次。從車站到山脚還有一二里路，車站上有專供給旅客遊河的小划子，我們就五個人佔據了一個向佘山搖去，沒有幾分鐘，就到了前山門口。上去是一條沙泥路，兩旁修竹千竿，仿佛杭州從靈隱寺上　光的途徑一樣。到了中山，就是教堂，前面是水泥鋪的廣場。一位引導我們的牧師已經上山去。接洽參觀天文臺，我們祗在那裏站一站脚，又前進了。從那裏到山頂去有二路可通，一條是徑折式的，很平坦；一條是石級直上的，不過可以少走許多路。我們走了徑折路，路上每一個轉角的地方，建着一所苦路亭，一共是十所，象徵耶穌詩詞蒙難，最高有一所十字架亭。</p>
<p>天文臺在天巔，建築成一個砲臺形，那具架在樑上的巨大的望遠鏡就像高射砲了。引導我們的牧師就用他旅松三十五年的成績，說着生硬的鄉語向我們解釋：</p>
<p>「譬如要拍天上遠遠的一顆星，」他把望遠鏡對準了天空，又把一雙放在架子上的椅子旋到鏡的下面，表示人要坐在椅子上才可以觀望，「但是，要看太陽，不能這樣看，因為太陽光是極強的，要壞眼鏡。」他覺得話拉遠了，馬上又講要拍天上遠遠的一顆星，起碼要三點鐘，但是星球是在移動的——那是照普通人的說法，其實是地球在動，拍照的時候就要旋動那砲臺形的屋頂了。他一面把一個機鈕旋着給我們看，並且解釋：「我們有一個錶，算準了牠移動的快慢，用電力讓屋頂慢慢旋轉跟着，那顆星球，這樣就行了。」</p>
<p>雖然沒有實地試騐，但他的說明書和表演很使我們滿足了。</p>
<p>出來到山頂的大教堂。據說那堂建造了五年，很是瑰麗宏大，像我們在外國電影中看到的一樣。爬了山，參觀了許多地方，那時我們很感到疲乏，就站堂前向四面觀望，田畝，樹木，房屋，密密地排着：望到天的遠處，一位朋友學着「雷雨」中周沖的口吻：</p>
<p>「那邊有三朶白雲，……我們泛着一隻小船，飛，飛，飛，飛到那個世界，那個快樂的世界！」</p>
<p>那雖然是要解脫人世煩惱的一種幻想，但是在那樣的境界裏，確有悄然　世的感覺。</p>
<p>下山時我們走了石級的那條路，在山門前找到了搖來的划子，在小河中蕩漾着，藉以恢復疲乏的精神。太陽已經西斜了，晚風吹着我們的襯衣，蕩着，蕩着，我們幾乎想睡過去，四點半的車子却要開了，祗是悵悵地上了車。</p>
<p>後來知道主人為着旅客們暢遊起見，已積極　劃建造一所旅舍，山中夜遊，或月夜泛舟，想來另有一番光景吧，這願望當期以後日了，不過誰能夠預約明天的事呢？</p>

<h3>False Army Invades West Within the Month; Sui Province Crisis Imminent; Pacifying Strategy Adopts Guerrilla Warfare; Able-bodied Men from Various Banners in Chahar All Enlisted; Sha Wang Arrives in Sui to Discuss Peace in Ih Ju League</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in eastern Sui is increasingly tense. According to information received from a certain source, Li Shou-xin's puppet army in northern Chahar, consisting of ten regiments, has been replenished. The foremost unit is the Wang Ying division, with about two thousand of Wang's main cavalry force, mostly Mongol bandits from the Chahar and Sui regions. The Kangbao and Baochang areas are under the control of Wang Jing-xiu's puppet army from Rehe. Most of Li Shou-xin's troops are concentrated in Zhangbei. Besides arms and ammunition supplied by a certain source, a steady stream has recently arrived from Chengde, with as many as one hundred and twenty or thirty tanks and armored vehicles. Li Shou-xin's motor vehicle fleet has been completely reorganized. The puppet army's strategy for disturbing Sui is to imitate the guerrilla tactics of the Communist bandits in the Northwest, using cavalry as the main force, implementing harassment with a small number of troops to keep the National Army on constant alert, then advancing when the opportunity arises, and launching a full-scale attack when necessary. A certain source is building an airfield in the Alxa Banner and expanding military preparations, the main purpose of which is to threaten Suiyuan. The crisis in Sui Province is imminent. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet army has recently conscripted more than ten thousand bandits, mostly concentrated in the Shangdu and Shangyi areas. They previously had minor contact with our army and then retreated. It is said that the bandit army will be completely mobilized by the middle of this month and will soon begin its westward invasion. Zhou Dai, the Jin-Sui artillery commander, recently arrived in Sui from Taiyuan, inspecting the garrisoned troops along the way. On the 10th, he and Fu Zuoyi inspected the defenses of Guihua City, Wugongba, and other places. Lin Wang, the former representative of the Ulanqab League, and Ba Wang came to Sui. On the morning of the 10th, they reported the situation in northern Sui to Fu Zuoyi, claiming that northern Ulanqab League was still peaceful. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) A certain source is now supplying Wang Ying, Li Shou-xin, and other bandit units with a large amount of shells and gasoline for their westward invasion, planning to turn south after capturing Suiyuan, passing through northern Shanxi via Yanmen Pass into southern Shanxi, or else retreat from northern Chahar back to Rehe and firmly defend the Northeast. The Mongol puppet government has established eight departments: Education, Finance, Construction, Industry, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Military Administration, and Internal Affairs, and stationed heavy troops in Jiaxiasi and Chaoyangzhen. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Sha Wang, Chairman of the Sui-Mongol Council, left Sui for a long time and the council affairs urgently need to be handled. He started from the Zasak Banner at the beginning of the month, led dozens of sons and entourage to stay in Dongsheng County, and arrived in Baotou on the 8th. He arrived in Sui on the evening of the 10th. The Mongol members in Sui and the members of the Sui Provincial Government warmly welcomed him. The station was heavily guarded. Sha Wang's visit to Sui this time is for a longer stay. A Wang will also arrive in the next few days. Sha Wang said, he will convene a plenary session of the Sui-Mongol Council to determine the location of the Council, and the major plans for cultural education and construction are in urgent need of implementation. He has asked the Central Government to allocate funds for the project as soon as possible. Ih Ju League is peaceful and prepared for communist defense. If bandits come, they will be severely suppressed. On the evening of the 10th, Fu Zuoyi hosted a banquet for Sha Wang. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources concerned, the situation of the Mongol puppet bandit army jointly plotting to invade Sui is gradually becoming clear. Their invasion plan is also more cunning and comprehensive. It is stipulated that this month will be the period for launching disturbances. If the plan succeeds, they will launch a large-scale invasion next month. The operational steps are divided into three: (1) The Shi Ying bandit army will serve as the vanguard; (2) Li Shou-xin and other puppet troops will conduct frontal operations; (3) The puppet Mongol army will join forces later. Wang's bandit army has formed several cavalry units, and a large number of bullets were transported by a certain source on the 7th and distributed to each cavalry, with a limit of 400 rounds per person. They immediately set out to various places in eastern Sui, with the intention of harassing and luring our front-line defenders to pursue, then taking the opportunity to attack and seize positions with a large army, using the old trick of attacking in the east and striking in the west. Our side has long seen through this trick, and the bandit's plan will definitely be difficult to succeed. Also, De Wang is still in Jiaxiasi, training troops, and is extremely busy. A person named Jin Yongchang is planning everything for him. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) The able-bodied men of various banners in Chahar have been enlisted. Bao Yueqing is currently handling military affairs in Dolon. His unit has been stationed near Jiaxiasi. Wang Ying's bandit army has expanded from 5,000 to 10,000 troops, with extremely sufficient supplies. De Wang is currently residing in Jiaxiasi and has not returned to Ganfu for more than ten days. Dai Qinglian, an official from the Mongol Political Council's Beijing Office, arrived in Jiaxiasi to meet with De Wang and will return to Beijing within a few days. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Zhangyuan news, the puppet army in northern Chahar only received three yuan per month for food expenses for each soldier and six yuan per month for each officer during the past two months due to the reorganization and training period. Now that the organization is complete, in order to encourage the invasion of Sui and Shanxi, the puppet Mongol government has stipulated that formal pay will be issued: ten yuan for deputy soldiers, eleven yuan for regular soldiers, twelve yuan for deputy squad leaders, thirteen yuan for regular squad leaders, fifty yuan for second lieutenants, seventy yuan for first lieutenants, ninety yuan for captains, one hundred and sixty yuan for majors, two hundred and forty yuan for lieutenant colonels, three hundred and sixty yuan for colonels, four hundred and eighty yuan for brigadier generals, six hundred yuan for major generals, and seven hundred and twenty yuan for lieutenant generals. The puppet Mongol government's Ministry of Military Administration has allocated and implemented these payments from the 1st of this month. (11th China United News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Gui Sui. Sha Wang, Chairman of the Sui-Mongol Council, said that he had been away from Sui and returned to his banner for several months. However, since the communist bandits in northern Shaanxi repeatedly tried to flee north, and the Ih Ju League is adjacent to Shaanxi, the defenses of the entire League must be personally managed. Therefore, he stayed in the banner for a long time. Now that the bandits have been repeatedly suppressed by the National Army and many have fled west, the entire territory of the Ih Ju League has gradually become peaceful. He took the time to come to Sui for a visit, in addition to participating in the horse racing competition, he also took care of the affairs of the Council. The return date to the banner has not been determined. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Sha Wang is scheduled to go to Beijing recently to report on the affairs of the Sui-Mongol Council to the Central Government. (10th Dispatch)</p>

The president of the company, Sogawa, recently proposed Anglo-Japanese cooperation in the Tianjin electricity business to the British Embassy in Japan, attracting attention from all sides. Sogawa met with Saxonm, the commercial officer of the British Embassy in Japan, saying that Japan's development of the North China economy had no exclusive intention. The Tianjin Electric Power Company plans to build a thermal power plant with a capacity of 30,000 kilowatts. In order to seek Anglo-Japanese cooperation, Japan plans to establish a power plant near Kaiping or Luanzhou to use coal mined by British merchants. It also plans to cooperate with the Tianjin British Concession Public Works Bureau to operate the business. After receiving this proposal, Saxonm consulted with the British Embassy authorities and is scheduled to reply within a few days. (11th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) President Sogawa's proposal to the British Embassy seems to have the understanding of the military and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Japan's intention to include foreign capital in the operation of various enterprises in North China is quite noteworthy. (11th Allied News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhangjia Hutuktu, the Mongol Banner Pacification Envoy, arrived in Beijing at 4 pm on the 11th. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission sent Zhao Zhen, a counselor, to Xuzhou to welcome him. Yellow cloth banners with the slogan "Welcome the Mongol Banner Pacification Envoy Zhangjia Hutuktu" were hung at Pukou Station and the main thoroughfares in the city.

<h3>Chengdu and Beihai Incidents May Be Resolved Separately First; Adjustment Negotiations to Begin This Week; Japan Decides to Focus on Reality and Avoid the Void in North China; Soejima Returns to Nagasaki and Makes Confusing Remarks; Li Sihao Flies to Beijing and Meets Song Zheyuan Twice for Heart-to-Heart Talks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the negotiations on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, Ambassador Kawagoe paid a visit to President Chiang on the 8th. Chiang told him that he should consult through diplomatic channels in a peaceful and friendly atmosphere based on the principle of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, namely administrative integrity. Regarding diplomatic issues, Foreign Minister Zhang should continue to discuss them. As for the date of Kawagoe's fourth meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang, since the 10th and 11th are holidays, the embassy will send personnel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th to determine the time to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang so that they can continue to discuss. It is hoped that the Chengdu and Beihai incidents can be resolved separately first in accordance with international practice. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is still difficult to predict the future of Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. According to certain sources, Japan is determined to obtain North China and adopt a method of focusing on reality and avoiding the void. Matumoto Takayoshi, head of the Beiping Special Affairs Agency, proposed to force the authorities of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, and Sui provinces to comply with a large military force. Lieutenant General Tatekawa, senior advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, consulted with the Kwantung Army authorities in Jilin several times. After a new plan arrived in Beiping and was communicated to various important Japanese figures, they began to take further action. (11th China United News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nagasaki) Director Soejima, who carried important instructions from the government and conveyed them to Ambassador Kawagoe, and at the same time listened to the detailed local situation from the overseas agencies of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs Ministries, returned to Nagasaki on the Shanghai Maru at 10:40 pm on the 11th, and still took the original ship east at 5 o'clock. According to what he said to people on the ship, he and Ambassador Kawagoe, Consul General Suma in Nanjing, Commander of the Third Fleet Kawaji, and Commander of the Marine Corps Kondo have all met and listened to the local situation in detail. He also said that this is a very important decision for the negotiations between Japan and China. From [blank] I am paying close attention to whether the future negotiations can proceed smoothly. I am personally of the opinion that I cannot discuss this here. As for reaching the worst degree of Sino-Japanese war, I feel that it will not reach this point. Recently, The Times of London and the Shanghai North China Daily News simultaneously published articles expressing sympathy for China. This is to a certain extent a reflection of the intentions of the British government, which is quite noteworthy. (11th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Says We Don't Want to "Be Slapped and Smile"</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian criticized the results of the meeting between Chairman Chiang and Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe in an article today, stating that China does not want to "be slapped and smile." This is the first time since 1931. China has now adopted a calm and determined attitude. The newspaper also asked everyone to pay attention to the fact that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised "counter-demands" to Japan's "demands." It continued that Japan temporarily withdrew its "demands" without gaining anything after threatening China in the usual way. It would be reckless speculation to say that Japan will abandon its attitude of aggression towards China, or that China will not continue to make concessions. But at the very least, it can be said that China is no longer as tolerant as before. If so, this may be a turning point in the situation in the Far East. Japanese military leaders must decide whether they are willing to risk starting a war. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Comments on Negotiations, Says the Future Has Difficulties</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, only three newspapers here, the Asahi Shimbun, the Hochi Shimbun, and the Chugai Commercial News, discussed Chairman Chiang's meeting with Ambassador Kawagoe in their editorials. The Asahi Shimbun said that although there has been no rapid progress on the specific issues of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, both sides believe that there is no disagreement on resolving various outstanding issues through diplomatic negotiations. Therefore, it is too early to criticize the effects of the meeting between Chiang and Kawagoe at this time. It is not appropriate to be overly optimistic. The newspaper also said that China's position on adjusting relations between the two countries is based on the principle of maintaining territorial sovereignty and administrative integrity, and must implement no threats and no aggression. The most important of Japan's demands are (1) the special status of North China and (2) a common anti-communist front. Since China insists on its position of mutual benefit and equality and upholds territorial rights as a talisman, the future of the negotiations may encounter unexpected difficulties. The Hochi Shimbun said that after the meeting between Chiang and Kawagoe, a ray of light was found, but the current situation is on the verge of danger. Therefore, it is dangerous to be optimistic about the smooth progress of the negotiations. Once the Japanese government discovers the insincerity of the National Government, it should take resolute action, but if it is sure that China has considerable sincerity, it should be given sufficient time to achieve our goals. The Chugai Commercial News said that the meeting between Chiang and Kawagoe has brought Sino-Japanese negotiations into a new stage. The newspaper hopes that the current negotiations should proceed quickly to avoid misunderstandings by third parties. Wasting time and allowing third parties to unnecessarily participate is an extremely clumsy move. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Twenty-Fifth National Day Anniversary: The Central Government Holds a Celebration Grand Meeting; Chairman Lin Gives a Speech on Earnestly Practicing the Three Principles of the People; Envoys from Seventeen Nations Meet with Chairman Lin to Offer Congratulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At seven o'clock on the morning of National Day, the Central National Government held a joint celebration grand meeting in front of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Those in attendance included National Government Chairman Lin, Central Vice-Chairman Chiang, and Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Feng Yuxiang, Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Ding Weifen, Zhang Ji, Li Liejun, Chu Minyi, Ma Chaojun, Chen Bulei, Zhang Chong, Wang Zhengting, Shao Yuanchong, Fang Zhi, Chen Shaokuan, Gu Zhengding, and others, totaling over a hundred individuals. Also present were party affairs staff members above the level of director-general, Wang Qijiang and Wang Zixian, as well as civil officials from various ministries and commissions holding positions of Simplified Appointment or higher, such as Chen Qicai and Wei Huai, and military officers of the rank of Colonel or higher, such as Gu Zhenglun and Chen Xunyong, amounting to approximately one thousand people. Chairman Lin and the civil officials wore blue robes with black mandarin jackets, while Chairman Chiang and the military officers wore full dress uniforms of the army and navy with swords. Party affairs personnel all wore black Zhongshan suits, appearing orderly and solemn. At precisely seven o'clock, music was played, and ceremonies were conducted. Under the leadership of Chairman Lin, everyone performed the rituals as prescribed. Then, the Chairman delivered a speech. After the speech, he led the Standing Committee members of the Central Committee and the heads of the Five Yuan to pay their respects at the Mausoleum. After the respects were paid, music was played, and the ceremony concluded. Everyone descended the mountain and proceeded to the Mausoleum Park to participate in the grand review of the Boy Scouts. Chairman Lin delivered a speech, the original text of which is as follows: "In commemorating National Day, we must earnestly practice the Three Principles of the People. Today is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Day of the Republic of China. This is the day the Republic of China was born. Only with this day could there be the Republic of China as it exists today. Therefore, the historical significance of this anniversary is extremely great. Our National Day anniversary originated from the Xinhai Revolution of twenty-five years ago. The success of the Xinhai Revolution had two aspects of significance. First, in terms of ethnicity, it overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the equal status of the five ethnicities. Second, in terms of civil rights, it ended the autocratic regime of more than forty years and created a republic with the people as the main body. Although the success in these two aspects only realized a part of our Party's policy, it was still very valuable to have such gains at that time. After the Xinhai Revolution, in order to quickly end military operations and engage in practical construction, our Party ceded this newly acquired political power to Yuan Shikai. Unfortunately, Yuan Shikai used his power to do things that violated the law, wanting to become emperor and overthrow the republic. Later, although Yuan Shikai fell, there were several more incidents of restoration and destruction of the law. The political power of the country fell into the hands of warlords, making a good republic riddled with holes. This is truly heartbreaking. In the fifteenth year of the Republic, our Party, adhering to the legacy of the late Premier Sun, implemented the Northern Expedition. Relying on the spirit of the late Premier Sun in heaven and the loyalty and bravery of all the officers and soldiers, we were able to pacify the entire country in the shortest possible time. Over the past ten years, after much arduous struggle, we have once again seen the realization of national unity on this year's National Day anniversary. The foundation of the country has since become even more consolidated. Today, as we hold the National Day commemoration, we naturally feel an extraordinary sense of joy. However, at this time, how should we maintain this unified situation so that future National Day commemorations will be more valuable and meaningful? This is indeed the responsibility that each of us should fulfill. To achieve this goal, the only way is for everyone to rise up together and faithfully practice the Three Principles of the People. To explain it more specifically, in terms of nationalism, we must demand the liberation of the Chinese nation. We must do our best to eliminate anything that hinders the survival of our nation. The basic rights of a nation to survive should be sympathized with by any other nation. At the same time, for all ethnic groups within the country, we must recognize that their positions are equal and unite together to seek coexistence and co-prosperity. In terms of democracy, we must continue to train the people to exercise the four direct civil rights in order to achieve the goal of granting power to the people. At the same time, the central government must establish a strong government and implement the five-power system, ensuring that the people have power and the government has ability, completing the most advanced country of modern times. In terms of people's livelihood, we must concentrate the nation's human, financial, and material resources to complete national economic construction, ensuring that all people in the country can enjoy the minimum happiness of life. If this is the case, not only can the unity of the country be maintained forever, but our entire nation can also be revived and prosper, and its position in the world will increase day by day. Therefore, today, as we hold this commemoration, everyone must feel that their responsibility is great and work together to implement the Three Principles of the People, so that our country can advance without limit following each year's National Day anniversary."

<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial Ceremony for the Disaster Suffered by the Premier in London</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held the 40th anniversary memorial ceremony for the disaster suffered by the Premier in London in the auditorium at 9 a.m. on the 11th.

The meeting ended at 9:15 a.m. (Eleventh Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the memorial ceremony for the disaster suffered by the Premier in London held by the Central Party Headquarters, Ye Chucang's original speech roughly stated that the details of the disaster suffered by the Premier in London were reported in great detail last year, and all comrades have heard it. Therefore, today, in addition to historical summaries, I would like to contribute some thoughts. We feel that the disaster was truly a period for the Party to forge and develop its spirit. From creating to building the Republic of China, one side was suffering a disaster there, and the other side was constantly progressing. Therefore, a country's disaster is the realization of its national strength, and a person's disaster is the realization of their personal strength. Yesterday, we held a National Day meeting, which was a commemoration of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty. Today, we are holding a meeting here to commemorate the Qing Dynasty's use of cunning means to harm our Premier. Thinking about these two commemorations together, we know even more that the more cunning methods the Qing Dynasty used to try to obstruct our Party, the more our Party was able to develop its spirit and complete the mission of the revolution. We have such prior instructions in the past, and we will not escape this concept in the future. Our country is currently suffering a disaster. If our comrades can temper their body and mind and develop their spirit in the midst of the disaster, then they will definitely be able to take risks. Yesterday, Vice Chairman Jiang said that to consolidate the unity of the country, we must first restore the national spirit and national morality passed down by our ancestors, which is to ask us to temper our spirit in the midst of the disaster and follow the teachings of the Premier and the martyrs to establish the methods for our self-reliance and national construction.

<h3>Comment on Sir Rothermere's Remarks in Japan</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>British press tycoon Lord Rothermere recently traveled to the Far East. When he passed through Japan, he spoke with Tokyo reporters on the Yokohama boat, saying that the British people very much hoped for the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance, but it should not be aimed at opposing the United States. The Knight's intention was that Britain wanted to be friendly with Japan and did not want to lose friendship with the United States. He wanted to have both fish and bear's paw. This remark came from the mouth of Sir Rothermere, and we need to pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The Knight is the brother of the late British press king Lord Northcliffe. Since Northcliffe's death, the Knight has inherited his business and is now the central figure in London's Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Evening News and other publications. His capital and power further dominate the majority of the British paper industry and local newspapers and magazines. Millions of people read his publications every day. Eighty or ninety percent of British newspapers are controlled by three press giants. One is Knight Bray, and the other is Knight Beaverbrook, and the other is Knight Rothermere. Bray's operation of the newspaper industry is purely for profit and has little political advocacy. Beaverbrook is fanatical about politics, but his resources are far inferior to the Northcliffe brothers. His views are the same as Rothermere, and Rothermere's capital is also in his enterprise. Therefore, the Rothermere newspaper system is the greatest force in British public opinion. He is conservative in his thinking and has a relationship with Sir Mosley, the leader of the British Fascists. His published remarks can represent the conservative British heart. His observation of the Far East is enough to influence the hearing of the British people and the attitude of the government.</p>
<p>Let us now discuss the Knight's Anglo-Japanese alliance proposal. Britain's Far Eastern policy has always wavered between Anglo-Japanese compromise and Anglo-American cooperation. Since the Great War, the relationship between the United States and Japan has become increasingly bad. The conflict of interest between Britain and Japan has increased. As a result, it became difficult to take into account the policies of the United States and Japan. When the Washington Conference opened in 1922, Britain had no choice but to abandon its old policy of the Anglo-Japanese alliance and replace it with the Four-Power Treaty. Today, the spirit of the Four-Power Treaty has been completely destroyed. Britain is occupied with matters in Europe and seeks only to be safe and secure in the Far East. If Japan gives considerable respect to Britain's rights and interests in China, Nanyang, and other places, then the restoration of the Anglo-Japanese alliance is not what the British do not want. Sir Ross's visit to the East and Ambassador Hughgeessen's visit to Japan are all with this hope. However, facts prove that not only is there no possibility of compromise between Britain and Japan, but even if there is a compromise, there is no hope of preserving Anglo-American friendship and maintaining the unity of the British Empire. Fish and bear's paw cannot be had at the same time.</p>
<p>Japan has stated that third countries have no right to intervene in Far Eastern political issues, and Britain's military power in the Far East is no longer comparable to what it was before the European War. Therefore, Britain has lost its equal voice with Japan on Far Eastern events. To reluctantly win Japan's favor, it must come at a very high price. The opening of markets in India and Australia and the recognition of Japan's special status in China are all examples. If Britain can tolerate this kind of sacrifice, then the establishment of the Anglo-Japanese alliance is tantamount to Britain's withdrawal from the Far Eastern political stage, allowing Japan to do whatever it wants in China and Nanyang. British Empire countries such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have long feared Japan's aggressive ambitions. Their traditional policy is to promote Anglo-American cooperation and use the superior military power of the United States in the Pacific to maintain their safety. If the Anglo-Japanese alliance can be established, it will anger the United States. These autonomous states will definitely rather break away from the motherland and join the United States. Once the United States and Japan fall out and the London government favors Japan, the entire British Empire will inevitably disintegrate, and the Anglo-Saxon nation will recognize Washington as the capital.</p>
<p>We believe that maintaining the collective security system in East Asia is the only beneficial way for Britain. At a time when Japan's aggression is rampant, to freely discuss the Anglo-Japanese alliance in order to preserve the immediate petty profits and sacrifice the interests of friendly countries, the ideals of the country, and the goodwill of strong neighbors is not a good plan. To restore the spirit of the Four-Power Treaty, the only way is for the United States and Britain to cooperate, promote Japan's awakening, unite the forces of peace, and make the forces of aggression submit. This is not only an urgent task for East Asian countries, but also the effort of all mankind at present. British press leaders should actively promote this. I would like to offer this idea to Sir Rothermere.</p>

Chairman Lamaz, the Argentine Foreign Minister, voted to pass the report submitted by the General Committee on the Amendment of the Covenant, and appointed representatives of the fifteen member states of the Executive Yuan and representatives of the thirteen non-member states as members, ordering them to study the implementation of the various principles contained in the Covenant. It is learned that the committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on December 7th and decided to extend the term of the "European Union Plan" Research Committee for one year (the European Union Plan was proposed by the late French Foreign Minister Briand, and the chairman of the Research Committee is currently the Speaker of the French National Assembly, Herriot). The General Assembly then voted to pass ten reports submitted by various committees without debate, including (1) suppressing terrorism, (2) various mandated territories, (3) international intellectual cooperation, and (4) reducing and limiting armaments (the content of which is based on the proposal submitted by France, advocating convening the presidium of the disarmament conference), and then adjourned to 3:30 p.m. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Executive Yuan Last Meeting; Chinese Representative Attends</h3>
<p>Authorize the Chairman to Decide on the Date of the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 84th meeting of the League of Nations Executive Yuan opened on September 18th and was adjourned at the last meeting held this afternoon. China and Latvia were recently elected as non-permanent directors of the Executive Yuan and attended the meeting for the first time today. The Chinese representative attending the meeting was Guo Taiqi, Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and the Latvian representative attending the meeting was Kapo. Today's meeting was chaired by Chilean representative Aiguro. First, the chairman delivered welcome speeches to the representatives of China and Latvia, and decided to have French representative and Foreign Minister Viano speak, saying that France intends to submit various issues to the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference for discussion. Some of these issues, such as the issue of publicizing military expenditure budgets and the issue of supervising the arms manufacturing industry, have already been studied in considerable detail. If possible, it is also intended to re-submit the issue of limiting armaments for discussion. At this point, the Executive Yuan passed a resolution authorizing the Chairman of the Executive Yuan to decide on the date for convening a meeting of the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference.

<h3>Japan Watches the Evolution of the European Situation; Instructs Envoys to Handle it Well</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches importance to the impact of the Spanish Civil War on the European political situation and instructs ambassadors stationed in various countries to pay attention to the situation in Europe, allowing them to deal with the attitude of the Soviet Russia. According to information recently received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from major ambassadors, the fall of Madrid is only a matter of time. On the 9th, the Soviet government requested the Committee on Non-Intervention to implement the non-intervention regulations, otherwise the Soviet Russia would withdraw from the committee. However, Germany and Italy believe that the Soviet Russia and France violated the non-intervention agreement and determined that the Soviet Russia's supply of weapons to the Spanish government is a confirmed fact. The issue of the fall of Madrid has transformed the ideological opposition of European countries into political opposition. Foreign Minister Arita is considering its direct and indirect impact on Japan and instructs all departments to study countermeasures to deal with the situation. (Tenth United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Communist Party Holds a Meeting; Right-Wingers Hold a Counter-Demonstration</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Communist Party will hold meetings in ten locations in the three provinces of Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, and Moselle tonight. (The original meeting places totaled 127, but the authorities changed them to ten after repeated consultations with Communist leaders because they feared it would cause trouble.) The Metz meeting began at 8 p.m., with 3,000 participants. More than 300 right-wingers from various nearby rural areas came to Metz to hold a counter-demonstration, intending to break into the meeting place. They were dispersed by the police and patrol teams, and the patrol teams patrolled around the meeting place to prevent it strictly. The Communist Party was able to hold the meeting peacefully. Only a few people inside and outside the meeting place shouted protests. The meeting was adjourned at 10:30 p.m. At that time, many counter-demonstrators marched on the streets, insulting and scolding Communist Party Secretary-General Dorris and singing the Marseillaise. Other than that, no other incidents occurred. Fascists in Strasbourg City had some disturbances and two were arrested by the police. All public institutions were guarded by infantry to prevent accidents.</p>

<h3>Italian Government Resolves to Strengthen Naval and Air Force Armaments; National Armament Factories Increase Production; Build Air Bases in the Mediterranean; Dozens of Warships are Under Construction</h3>
<p>(Rome) The cabinet met today to consider Italy's combat strength. Because certain military supplies are urgently needed, it was decided to extend the working hours of workers in the air force and navy armament industries to 60 hours per week. The cabinet also decided to build airfields in the Po River basin, the Adriatic and Tuscan coasts, and on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. Although the aircraft production volume is satisfactory, it is still insufficient to meet the needs of the current plan. Therefore, it was agreed to establish a large factory dedicated to manufacturing aircraft engines. It was also decided to double the number of air force officer students this year, and the number of naval officers will also increase by 60,000. The cabinet believes that the nation's military preparations are currently being strengthened as a whole and have achieved good results. (Tenth Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The State Council issued a communiqué today, announcing that Italy will step up its military buildup in the near future. The communiqué stated that there are currently 1,200 armament factories in Italy, which are working at full capacity. The working hours of each armament factory per week have increased from 40 hours to 60 hours, and the manufacturing of air force and naval armaments is particularly busy. Dozens of naval warships are currently under construction. In general, Italy must consolidate its naval position in order to cope with the new naval shipbuilding program announced by the United Kingdom, in case of an emergency. Some observers believe that the recent conflicts within the Committee for Adjusting Measures for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War have created a new factor of unrest in Europe. The Italian government issued the above communiqué at this time, and its intention is to show all countries that Italy is prepared for any eventuality and should not be taken lightly. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Implement Shipbuilding Program</p>
<p>(Rome) At a meeting of the State Council yesterday, Prime Minister Mussolini submitted a report on the country's military preparations and said that dozens of naval warships are currently under construction. The staff of this agency therefore reviewed the Italian Navy's shipbuilding program issued on January 1 this year and identified the types and numbers of these warships as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Two battleships, namely "Littorio" and "Vittorio Veneto", with a displacement of 35,000 tons each; (2) Two B-class cruisers, each of 7,500 tons; (3) Four destroyers; (4) Eighteen torpedo boats; (5) Sixteen submarines, ten of which will be completed soon, for a total of 43 vessels, totaling 118,375 tons.</p>
<p>In addition, the Italian government recently decided to add (1) ten small submarines, each with a displacement of 600 tons, named after Abyssinian villages, with a total cost of 200,000,000 lira; (2) four dispatch boats, each with a displacement of 800 tons; (3) more than twenty small fish need boats.

The new airfields to be built by the Cabinet yesterday are estimated to cost more than £15 million. At the same time, the Cabinet also passed an order stating that Italy will abide by Section 4 of the 1930 London Naval Treaty, that is, submarines must abide by the regulations of international law and must not sink or disable a ship without first transferring the passengers and sailors on board to a safe place.

<h3>Italian Youth Party Army Exercises Pretend War</h3>
<p>(Rome) Three regiments of the Fascist Party's youth army, each with three battalions, are scheduled to hold exercises this afternoon. Prime Minister Mussolini will visit and watch. The exercise program is based on the assumption that the enemy has cavalry and tanks as reinforcements, and the youth army will attack them. The youth army is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one and was formed in October 1930. There are currently 15,500 officers and more than one million soldiers, all of whom carry firearms and have received military training, which is what the Italian newspapers call "the reserve army of the future."

<h3>Faster Than a Thunderclap: Austria Dissolves the Home Guard, Chancellor Becomes Sole Dictator, Prince Starhemberg's Pro-Italian Faction Loses Power, Capital City Resembles an Armed Military Camp</h3>
<p>(Vienna) After the cabinet held an emergency meeting and passed a resolution granting unlimited power to Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg, he has become Austria's sole dictator. The cabinet decided to dissolve the Home Guard, led by Starhemberg, and all cabinet members, including those in the Home Guard, must swear allegiance to Chancellor Schuschnigg. The cabinet meeting started at 5:00 PM yesterday and lasted until 8:00 AM this morning. This decision is tantamount to driving Starhemberg out of Austrian politics. Starhemberg was summoned to the Chancellery at night to express his views. Starhemberg demanded the positions of Vice-Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief of the Home Guard, but the Chancellor refused. The Chancellor then met with Vice-Chancellor Major Baron Feyfar and Finance Minister Dr. Draxler, as both were members of the Home Guard. The Chancellor strongly urged them to break away from Starhemberg. Later, a law was passed to dissolve all political and military groups, including the Home Guard. President Miklas signed the order and left the Chancellery at 8:30 AM this morning. Immediately after, due to rumors spreading from abroad, an order was issued for the military and police to be on high alert. The general public believes that Starhemberg may take drastic action to resist the cabinet's decision to dissolve the Home Guard, but since the entire military and police force are loyal to the Chancellor, such a move would be suicidal. Currently, all cabinet members, including Major Baron Feyfar and Dr. Draxler, are behind Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg. Schuschnigg's decisive action to resolve the Home Guard issue with lightning speed and fulfill his long-held ambition can be described as a great achievement. According to a press release, the Chancellor held an emergency cabinet meeting to deal with the political crisis. Cabinet members Major Baron Feyfar, Dr. Draxler, and Mr. Berger, all of whom were associated with paramilitary groups, submitted their resignations. The Chancellor reported this to the President, who reappointed them to their original positions. The cabinet then decided to dissolve all military and paramilitary groups by law. The Chancellor declared at the cabinet meeting that all members recommended by him and appointed by the President must not bear any other obligations or be subject to any other constraints. All cabinet members accepted this statement. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Since the cabinet decided to dissolve the Home Guard yesterday, the Austrian capital has become an armed camp. All public institutions are heavily guarded. Machine guns are placed all around the Chancellery to prevent unlawful actions by Home Guard members. At the same time, Home Guard leader Prince Starhemberg has fled, his whereabouts unknown. It is reported that Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg will grant Major Feyfar a high position in the Home Guard in recognition of his loyalty. 100,000 people aged 18 to 42 are now required to serve in the Home Guard. The government took the opportunity to dissolve the paramilitary Home Guard due to a dispute between the two leaders, Starhemberg and Feyfar. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg dissolved all military groups in the country, newspapers here have commented on it, believing that this move signifies the gradual decline of Italian influence in Austria and other countries in Central Europe, while Chancellor Schuschnigg's power and German influence in Austria are becoming stronger. Bertina, a well-known reporter for the Paris Echo, stated, "In terms of the international situation, Austria should regard itself as a Germanic nation-state from now on, and its actions will follow Germany's lead. Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will travel to Berlin soon, perhaps to try to restore Italy's image and make Germany participate in the Austro-Italian-Hungarian agreement in some way. But no matter what kind of alliance is formed between Germany, Austria, Italy, and Hungary in the future, Germany's influence will inevitably become stronger. Italy is well aware of this and may at any time feel the need to cooperate with Western European countries again." The Socialist Party's newspaper "Le Populaire" stated that former Austrian Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg was originally a direct representative of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but recently, the Italian Prime Minister failed to fully support him, leading to the dissolution of the Patriotic Defense League and the loss of its autonomy. This move will promote German influence in Austria and cause the Italian Prime Minister to lose his influence in Vienna. The Radical Socialist Party's newspaper "La République" stated, "We must remember two things: first, the prominent pro-Italian figure, Prince Starhemberg, has now lost power, at least for the time being; second, Chancellor Schuschnigg, who signed the German-Austrian agreement, has now won."

Only Italy and Germany sent army delegations to the funeral, demonstrating the goodwill of the two countries towards Hungary. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Launches Full-Scale Attack on the Capital, General Franco Personally Commands, Final Victory or Defeat to be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>Burgos: The headquarters of the Nationalist Army recently announced that our army will attack the capital, Madrid, tomorrow to decide the final victory or defeat. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Talavera: The fate of Madrid can be said to be sealed after the rebel army, personally planned and commanded by General Franco, has won many victories in guerilla warfare related to military matters. After occupying San Martín and Valdeiglesias, the rebel army captured Cebreros late last night, thus gaining access to the highway directly from Ávila to Toledo for the first time. General Varela, who is now leading the main force to attack Madrid, can advance from Toledo and Maqueda without worrying about his left flank being attacked from the north and south by militias on the Talavera to Toledo line. At the same time, it is reported that the morale in Madrid is still very high, as the government has repeatedly announced news of victory. According to government bulletins, government troops won a counter-attack yesterday, attempting to encircle the enemy army surrounding the capital. Government artillery fiercely bombarded enemy positions in Navalpilar and Cebreros. The enemy's fierce attack on Segovia has been repelled by government troops. The rebel side claims to have occupied the important port of Manilva, the gateway to Malaga, and has repeatedly bombarded Bilbao and attacked the area by air, killing no less than 300 people. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Malaga: The government announced that after a fierce counter-attack by government troops, it has stopped the rebel army advancing in the north of Malaga province. The rebel army suffered 80 casualties and 30 were captured. A rebel plane flew over Malaga today, and a bomb hit the barracks. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Two Armies in the Oviedo Area</h3>
<p>Madrid: The rebel army continues to encircle Madrid, but those claiming to have occupied the town of Segovia and destroyed the railway line between Madrid and Aranjuez, thereby cutting off the capital's railway traffic, have been clarified by the government. According to reports, the railway line to Aranjuez has been repaired and is operating normally. Fierce fighting is currently underway in Oviedo. Asturian miners who have penetrated the city have subdued the rebel army defending the city. It is reported that fires are breaking out everywhere, and the material losses will be enormous. The government claims that a column of government troops has defeated 900 rebel troops who were attempting to rescue Oviedo near Grullos. It also claims that government troops have defeated 4,000 rebel troops in the Bujaraloz area on the Aragon front. The rebel side claims to have occupied the town of Almaroc, the end point of the road from Madrid through Navalcarnero, and has bombed the ports of Malaga, Alicante, and Barcelona. The Madrid government has telegraphed the Spanish Ambassador in London, instructing him to inform the British government that among the rebel troops who recently occupied the island of Ibiza, apart from a few Spanish Falangists, the rest are Italian soldiers, totaling 700, carrying two Italian planes, and led by Italian Count Rossi. The army was transported to the front on Spanish ships, with the Italian national emblem painted on the ships. However, the authorities in Rome have firmly denied this claim. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italy, Germany, and Russia Accuse Each Other of Violating the Non-Intervention Agreement, Tense Atmosphere at the Adjustment Committee Meeting, Portuguese Representative Angrily Leaves the Venue After Russian Insults</h3>
<p>(London) During the second meeting of the International Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War this afternoon, a new twist suddenly occurred. Portuguese representative Mr. Voleribla carried out his threat to leave the meeting and resolutely departed. At that time, the Portuguese representative stated that he could not participate in the discussion on the Soviet Union's memorandum on violating the non-intervention agreement until instructions from Lisbon arrived. After speaking, he left the meeting. It is reported that the Portuguese representative had expressed his intention to leave the meeting this morning and strongly denied the Soviet government's accusation that Portugal and Germany and Italy jointly violated the agreement. Italian representative, Ambassador to Britain, Mr. Grandi, also made the same denial. The atmosphere at the meeting of the committee this morning was already quite tense. The tense situation did not diminish when the meeting resumed in the afternoon. It is reported that Italian representative Grandi strongly criticized the Soviet government, saying that the Russian statement was merely for propaganda purposes. After a meeting lasting six hours and fifteen minutes, the committee adjourned at 9:00 PM in the evening. According to a press release issued after the meeting, all participating countries agreed that any complaints about violations of the non-intervention agreement should be investigated immediately and quickly. The German representative's opinion was that the Soviet Union's letter falsely accusing Italy, Portugal, and Germany of violating the non-intervention agreement was beyond the committee's authority and was purely a political motive. The Italian representative also said that if any participating country unilaterally decides to abandon the agreement in the future, the Italian government will not be responsible for any consequences arising from it. The Soviet representative also refuted the Italian representative's accusation that it was for propaganda purposes and insisted that a way must be found to stop the continuation of violations of the agreement. It is now reported that the committee has decided to ask the acting chairman of the committee, Sir Plymouth, to contact the Portuguese government and urge the Portuguese representative to attend again. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) When the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War met yesterday afternoon, the Portuguese representative refused to attend and participate because the Soviet representative had accused the country of violating the non-intervention agreement in the morning. The general public believes that the country has already withdrawn from the committee. In fact, the dispute between Portugal and Russia has been temporarily resolved. After the Adjustment Committee adjourned yesterday morning, the Portuguese Chargé d'Affaires in the UK, Mr. Calheiros, declared to the Chairman of the Committee, the British Foreign Secretary Lord Plymouth, that the points raised by the Soviet government were unfounded and insulting. Although he had not consulted with his government, he would not continue to attend. After the committee adjourned in the afternoon, Plymouth conducted a private conversation with Calheiros. Calheiros then agreed to "interpret the refusal to attend as not meaning withdrawal from the committee." In view of this level, observers recently declared that when the committee met last night, Chairman Plymouth made every effort to prevent any harsh language that could cause discomfort to Portugal. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Informed sources recently stated that when the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War met yesterday, Italian Ambassador to Britain Grandi gave a speech accusing the Soviet government of directly aiding the Madrid government of Spain and listed the following facts: (1) The Soviet government supplied kerosene to the Madrid government without charging a price; (2) The Soviet government sent many specialists to assist the Spanish government, including four officers from the Soviet General Staff, who arrived in Barcelona, Spain, in early September; (3) In September, 30 disassembled Soviet aircraft were shipped by sea to Spain, and on the 25th of that month, 40 Soviet officers arrived by plane at Getafe Airport near Madrid and installed the aircraft; (4) The Barcelona Air Defense Artillery is equipped with several of the latest Soviet-made anti-aircraft guns, all of which are electrically controlled and operated by Soviet artillery; (5) Several Soviet ships loaded large quantities of munitions and ammunition and transported them to Antwerp, Belgium, and then transferred them to South American ships for transshipment to Spain.

<h3>Italy Interferes in the Spanish Civil War, Spanish Representative Reveals the Truth</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Spanish delegation to the League of Nations recently gave an interview to the press, revealing the circumstances of Italy's assistance to the Spanish rebel army in capturing the Mediterranean island of Ibiza (one of the Balearic Islands). After the island fell, a soldier named Feller and six fellow soldiers sailed to the Spanish mainland port of Gandia in a small boat. According to Feller's account to the Valencia port authorities, "On the 18th of last month, two Italian destroyers arrived at the island of Ibiza, and armed patrols landed and patrolled. Two days later, another black warship, named "Ciudad de Palma," also flying the Italian flag and escorted by two Italian warships and two three-engine aircraft, arrived at the port. About 1,000 people landed, of which only 300 were Spanish soldiers, and the rest were Italians and members of the Spanish Falange. This unit often held Mass in the port to celebrate. Italian Blackshirt leader Count Rossi also attended the ceremony. Afterwards, most of the troops returned to their base on Mallorca (also one of the Balearic Islands). The rebel army stationed on Ibiza executed Duivis, a lieutenant in the government infantry, Martina, a hall porter of the city hall, and other leftists by firing squad at the cemetery."

<h3>French Representative Mediates Disputes Between Two Factions, Does Not Want to Provoke the Anger of Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>(London) The French representative to the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee, fearing that supporting the Soviet representative's proposal would anger Germany and Italy and shatter the remaining hope of re-signing the Locarno Treaty, has agreed to handle the dispute between fascist and anti-fascist countries by exchanging documents. This question acknowledges that this method of handling has eliminated the possibility of the Non-Intervention Agreement collapsing and is a diplomatic defeat for the Soviet representative. The mediation method agreed today is that the Chairman of the Committee, Sir Plymouth, will request replies from Italy, Portugal, and Germany to the Madrid government's accusations against the three countries, and submit the Soviet Union's protest to the Portuguese government, requesting formal criticism. As for the Soviet Union's proposal to send a committee to conduct on-the-spot inspections on the borders of Spain and Portugal, it has been temporarily rejected. (Guomin News, 10th)</p>
<h3>Colonial Conference, Germany Decides to Postpone, Reasons for This are Speculated, Probably Unwilling to Offend Britain</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German people are all in a fog regarding the sudden decision to postpone the National Colonial Conference, which was originally scheduled to open in Breslau on the 16th of this month. The movement in Germany to awaken national attention to the colonies has been underway for some time. When the Breslau conference was decided to be convened, it was also planned to hold a large-scale propaganda campaign. According to the declaration issued today, the postponement of the conference was due to the sudden illness of one of its organizers, but many believe that this explanation is not fully justified and that there must be a deeper reason. German Economics Minister Dr. Schacht and Colonial Affairs Supervisor Mr. Epp are both leaders of the colonial movement, but Führer Hitler is not a leader of this movement. The new Ambassador to the UK, Mr. Ribbentrop, is also not very enthusiastic about the colonial issue, as Mr. Li believes that offending Britain because of this is harmful and unhelpful. The various events that have occurred at the recent British Conservative Party Congress have given the pro-British faction in Germany an excuse, even sacrificing the colonial issue temporarily in order to show goodwill to Britain.

<h3>Jabu Temple Holds Important Meeting, Puppet Military and Political Leaders All Participate, Merchants and Residents in Guyuan Area Disturbed, Wang Ying's Bandit Troops Plan to Invade Suidong</h3>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: On the 3rd of this month, the military and political leaders of Chahar North gathered at Jabu Temple to visit Prince De and had discussions with a certain special agency chief. On the 5th, an important meeting was held at Jabu Temple to discuss military issues in Chahar North and political issues in various cities and counties, agreeing to make the issue of invading Sui an important topic of discussion. Prince De, Li Shou-hsin, Bao Yueh-ching, Wang Ying, Wang Ching-hsiu, Chang Hai-peng, Liu Sheng-rong, and various army division and brigade commanders, as well as the chief of a certain special agency, all participated in the conference. All measures will be decided by the certain special agency chief and Prince De. Because there are too many issues to discuss, the conference has not yet concluded even after three days. The area around Guyuan and Pingdingbao in the eastern part of Chahar North is located on the border. Last year, when the puppet army advanced westward, they were the first to occupy it, and the residents suffered a great panic. At this critical diplomatic juncture, when Mongol bandits and puppet military and political leaders gather, rumors spread, and the people are in a state of panic. Recently, a unit of about 500 men from the Rehe puppet army will be deployed to the area around Guyuan and Pingdingbao. It is also reported that a large number of Rehe troops will advance into Chahar North. Therefore, rumors are rife, and merchants and residents in the area around Guyuan and Pingdingbao are extremely panicked. The shops in the area, fearing that the bandit army will pass through and suffer significant losses, have temporarily announced their closure.</p>
<p>Three thousand cavalrymen from a certain country stationed in Beipiao have been busy preparing for days. It is said that they are heading to the Chifeng area and then advancing westward to Duolun, Guyuan, and Pingdingbao in Chahar North. There are also reports that four aircraft and four tanks have been provided to Wang Ying's bandit troops, ordering Wang to lead his cavalry and infantry, totaling more than 4,000 men, to invade Suidong, with Wang acting as the vanguard and Li Shou-hsin providing support. The five counties of Jining, Fengzhen, Xinghe, Taolin, and Liangcheng in Suidong are quite tense. Since the 5th, there have been minor clashes on the Suidong border. (8th)</p>
<h3>Smuggling in Southern Fujian Revives, Unscrupulous Merchants Establish Smuggling Ports, and Hire Ronin as Bodyguards</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The practice of smuggling in southern Fujian, which had been largely suppressed, has gradually revived recently due to the abolition of the Provincial Tax Inspection Office and the subsequent closure of coastal branches. The most prevalent area is in the Quanzhou region. The central smuggling agency in Quanzhou, after being uncovered outside the Tumen Gate in Quanzhou in mid-September, moved to Tatau in Anhai. After the abolition of the Inspection Office, private goods began to become active from late September onwards. Unscrupulous merchants are engaging in large-scale activities, establishing smuggling ports in Tatau, Shigun, and Tangdong, because (1) there are very few military and police in the area; (2) transportation is inconvenient, and if the military and police come to arrest them, they can rely on their strict communication network to make full preparations before they arrive; (3) the people in the area are ignorant and only interested in profit, and can be used to load and unload private goods and secretly transport them inland; (4) the water in the port is shallow and very dangerous, and customs patrol ships and water police patrol boats cannot approach the shore, so there is no fear of waterborne ambush. Therefore, the smuggling agencies in these three places have never been uncovered. Currently, unscrupulous merchants and local tyrants are even engaged in armed smuggling. Recently, a large batch of private goods worth six to seven hundred thousand yuan will be shipped by sailboat from Taiwan to Quanzhou, and 40 ronin from a certain side will be hired as bodyguards, riding on a motorboat for escort, and equipped with machine guns. If they arrive safely, each bodyguard will be rewarded with 100 yuan. As soon as the north wind arrives, they can start loading and unloading at Shigun. Good merchants have already been deployed in Shigun to prepare to receive the imported private goods. Their organization is extremely strict. When private goods arrive in port, they can unload and land with the fastest action, immediately hiding them in nearby or farther villages. Those who disguise themselves as porters to secretly transport the goods also immediately transport them to the interior from the scattered hiding places. Those within the scope of the power of tyrants and local magnates even transport them by car. In addition, smugglers have also recently encountered difficulties, that is, in the past, private goods shipped from Taiwan to Fujian all exited from Magong Port in the Penghu Islands. Not to operate as a private goods center, because the place is located in the middle of the Taiwan Strait, between Taiwan and the coastal area of Fujian Province, the distance is relatively close, and it is located at the hub of maritime traffic in the coastal area of Fujian Province. Since Magong Military Port (Magong originally divided into military and commercial ports) was repeatedly entered into the fortress area by foreign ships seven times last year, the results of the investigation, although all claimed to have come to avoid the wind, the Japanese Navy believes that it is an organized international espionage activity. On July 1 of this year, it was announced that Magong Commercial Port was abolished, and foreign ships were not allowed to approach Magong, and even domestic ships were not allowed to enter or leave. As a result, the smuggling base disappeared due to the blockade of Magong Port and was changed to exit from the west coast of Taiwan. However, since the distance is far and the transportation of private goods is more inconvenient, it cannot be as it used to be with connecting sails, which also affects the smuggling business.

After arriving in Guangdong, Chen, along with Xu Jing Tang, Chief of Staff of the Fourth Route Army, and Deng Shizeng, Staff Officer, went to Hong Kong on the 7th of this month to visit Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Li Yangjing, and others, respectively, for several hours of discussions. When Chen met with Li Yangjing, he urged Li to take the position of Commander of the Bandit Suppression in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, to command certain two divisions, and to go to the destination to station troops. After finishing, he returned to Guangzhou on the Taishan Wheel that evening. He returned to the Tuisi Garden in Dongshan at around 6:00 a.m. on the 8th for a short rest and breakfast. Then, accompanied by Liu Keshu, Deputy Director of the Second Department of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, and two adjutants, Xu Zongfan and others, he took the Civil Aviation Corporation's Beidou aircraft to Guilin. Many people, including Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, Xu Jing Tang, Chen Qingyun, and Chen Ce, went to the airport to see him off that day. Chen and others took off at 10:10. Thirty minutes into the flight, when passing Zhaoqing, the weather suddenly changed, and there was dense fog, making it inconvenient to fly west. For safety reasons, they turned back to Guangzhou, which was already around 11:00. Until noon, according to the report from the Observatory, the weather had cleared. Chen accompanied Liu and Xu to Shipai Airport again and flew west on the Beidou aircraft for the second time. They landed in Nanning at around 4:00 p.m. Nanning's military, government, party, and various sectors had already prepared to welcome them at the airport, and they invited Chen and others to rest at the Lequn Society. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi hosted a banquet at the headquarters that evening, and Li Pinxian, Huang Xuchu, and other military and political leaders of Guilin Province attended. During the banquet, there was an exchange of views on the overall situation. Chen planned to return to Guangdong on the 9th, but due to various important matters that still needed to be discussed in detail with Li and Bai, and upon the invitation of Li and Bai, he attended the National Day military parade in Guilin Province on the 10th. He left Guilin only after the 11th. According to news here, the biggest task of Chief of Staff Chen's visit to Guilin was to urge Bai Chongxi to go to Nanjing and to convey the order of Chairman Chiang, instructing Li Zongren on the various opportunities for pacifying Guangxi and reorganizing the troops, and to discuss the incorporation of Weng Zhaoyuan's troops. Therefore, Chen's trip has a major mission. (October 10th)</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Japanese Residents in Jinan; The Total Number of Japanese Residents Has Decreased Significantly Compared to Before; Special Businesses Are Thriving</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The most prosperous time for Japanese residents in Jinan was when Qingdao was captured and the Jiaoji Railway was occupied. There were many residents along the railway line, such as in Weixian, Fangzi, Boshan, Zichuan, Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and other major stations. Jinan had as many as 3,000 residents. Since the establishment of the Washington Treaty, Japanese people, fearing world opinion, returned Qingdao and the Jiaoji Railway and withdrew the Qingdao garrison. Since then, the number of residents has decreased sharply. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the Japanese government promoted Manchuria as an unparalleled paradise, and many Japanese residents who had difficulty making a living went there. As a result, the total number of Japanese residents in Jinan is only over 1,900. Most Japanese residents live in groups. Previously, some lived in the city, but now they have completely moved to the Weier Road, Yongxianli, and Xingwei Balu areas in the commercial port in front of the Jinan Hospital. In this area, not only are the houses all Japanese-style, but whether it's workers or merchants, coming and going, they are all Japanese. Small vendors who come here to sell fish, vegetables, fruits, snacks, etc. according to their needs also use Japanese, making people feel as if they are in the Japanese archipelago when they come here. The current Japanese Consul is Ariyoshi, who was originally a secretary at the Japanese Embassy. The Vice Consul is Hashimoto, and the Military Attaché is Ishino, who are young Japanese military officers.</p>
<p>General Commerce</p>
<p>Among the commercial businesses of Japanese residents, the most prominent are banks. Initially, the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Chosen had branches. In addition, there was the Jinan Bank. After Qingdao was returned, the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Chosen successively closed down. (Yokohama Specie Bank notes disappeared, leaving only the Jinan Bank as its only financial institution.) Mitsubishi and Mitsui both have branches in Jinan, buying local products and selling machinery, etc. Qingxi Foreign Firm also has a branch, engaging in the import and export of cowhide, semi-bone, and local products. In addition, there is the Xiehua Electric Company, selling electrical machinery, which is very large in scale. Apart from these, there are many pharmacies. Previously, there was a Japanese theater in Yongxianli called the Leleza, which has long been closed. Now, the opera and films invited by the Resident Group are performed in the Public Hall for the entertainment of the residents. There is also a billiards department, etc. There are many Japanese and Korean prostitutes in Yongxianli, the so-called red skirt team of colonial pioneers.</p>
<p>Jinan Hospital</p>
<p>The Jinan Hospital, run by Japanese, is large in scale and well-equipped, comparable to the Qilu University Hospital. Several years ago, the director, Makino, and the chief of surgery, Xu Changdao, were both famous figures in the Japanese medical community. Now it is less impressive. The hospital's wards allow visitors, unlike other hospitals, so those who like romance often go there, and business is booming. During the May 3rd Incident, the Japanese army used the top of the hospital building to bombard the city heavily.</p>
<p>Education and Culture</p>
<p>Among the schools established by the Japanese, the Dongwen Middle School, which was funded by Toyota, was later completely transferred to Luo Puzhai and Zhu Guishan, who renamed it Donglu Middle School. Toyota, as the founder, is one of the directors. Previously, there was a Japanese elementary school in front of Jinan Hospital, educating students in Jinan, which was very large in scale, with two to three hundred students. The older students are sent to Qingdao Japanese Middle School to study. Now, a Zhongbei large parade ground is being built behind Jinan Hospital. In terms of news media, there is the Shandong Xinbao in Japanese and the Jinan Daily in Chinese, each with a circulation of over 1,000 copies. There is also the Allied Telegraph Agency.</p>
<p>Special Businesses</p>
<p>The so-called special businesses are drugs and drug-making machinery, mostly transported from Qingdao to Jinan for manufacturing and sale. Those that are outwardly known as certain foreign firms or pharmacies mostly engage in this business. Those of our countrymen who willingly degenerate go to buy or use them, and as a result, the poison is rampant. There are thirty to forty Japanese businesses that offer loans with monthly interest rates of five to ten percent. Poor citizens often go there, and they extract several million yuan of blood and sweat every year. Since the provincial government established the Yulu Pawnshop, it has gradually decreased in recent years. Also, since last year, the smuggling business has been booming. Smuggled goods come from Tianjin to Shandong, including rayon, cigarette paper, and sugar, of which rayon is the most common. In the past, they forcibly occupied Jinpu trains to transport them, totaling several million yuan in value per month. Since the investigation has been strict for the past two or three months, they have switched to using cars, which can arrive in Jinan from Tianjin on the same day. Each car costs 300 yuan. After being transported, they are unloaded at Japanese businesses around Wei Sanlu and then distributed to various counties. The numbers are not easy to investigate. There are also those who use small boats to transport goods to the Xiaohaikou landing in Lijin. Many silk weaving factories in Zhoucun store this rayon, and the situation is serious. It has not yet been heard that the authorities have any preventive measures.</p>
<p>Household Survey</p>
<p>Recently, the Jinan Provincial Public Security Bureau conducted a survey of Japanese residents, households, and businesses within the jurisdiction of each branch, with the following numbers:</p>
<p>First Branch of the Commercial Port: 35 households, 45 men, 33 women; 92 businesses, 186 men, 145 women.</p>
<p>Second Branch of the Commercial Port: 35 households, 85 men, 51 women; 92 businesses, 242 men, 266 women.</p>
<p>Third Branch of the Commercial Port: 32 households, 56 men, 36 women; 101 businesses, 268 men, 154 women.</p>
<p>Fourth Branch of the Commercial Port: 59 households, 93 men, 93 women; 37 businesses, 74 men, 79 women.</p>
<p>Xiang Third Branch: 1 household, the Puyi Sugar Factory, 2 Japanese engineers.</p>
<p>In total, there are 161 households in Jinan, with 279 men and 213 women; 323 businesses, with 772 men and 644 women. The total number of men and women in households and businesses is 1,908.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Continue to Request the Abolition of Miscellaneous Taxes; The Seafood Tax, Which is Not Found in the Rest of the Country, Has Not Been Completely Abolished; The Coconut Oil Tax Is Hitting the Inland Soap Industry</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes in Guangdong Province, the Finance Department has listed those that should be abolished and submitted them to the Review Committee for the Abolition of Harsh and Miscellaneous Taxes for review. The first resolution abolished twelve types of miscellaneous taxes, including dried fish and oyster products, within the dried fruit and seafood tax. The Finance Department has already announced this to the public. However, since the abolition of the above ten types, there has been no news of the abolition of the entire seafood tax. Seafood merchants recently jointly submitted a petition urging the authorities to implement the abolition of the entire seafood tax to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain the people's food supply. The reason given is that the seafood tax was originally a very small tax on foreign goods. After the abolition of the tax, merchants were recruited to contract the tax, and it has been increasing year by year, becoming more and more excessive. There is a tax on everything, and the tax collection procedures are cumbersome and the tax rates are heavy. Only the smallest and cheapest twelve types have been approved for abolition. The others are still not abolished. These are still not eliminated harmful policies that disturb merchants and harm the people. Moreover, the seafood tax is not found in other provinces of the country. Guangdong was previously under the rule of warlord separatists, who extorted and levied taxes, depleting resources, and therefore did not hesitate to cause hardship to merchants and people, creating this harsh and detailed tax. Now that Guangdong has been restored to the light and the private government is determined to abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes and start anew with the people, giving merchants and people who bear heavy burdens an opportunity to recover, this tax should be abolished immediately. Furthermore, the seafood tax is not found in other provinces. Merchants and people under the rule of the National Government should not bear this heavy tax burden alone in Guangdong, which is not fair. In addition, new industries have emerged in the province in recent years, such as matches, cloth, woven shirts and socks, and soap manufacturing, all of which have achieved results. Their products can be compared to those imported from abroad. Among them, the soap manufacturing industry is very popular in the inland. In recent years, many soap factories have been established, and the largest raw materials for soap manufacturing are tallow and coconut oil. This coconut oil is imported from areas such as Nanyang, and Guangdong's Nanlu and Qiongya also produce it. A large amount is transported to Guangzhou every year. Years ago, in order to raise funds, the Bureau of Imported Agricultural Products Tax began to levy a special tax on imported coconut oil. After this tax was levied, the price of imported coconut oil rose sharply, and the domestic supply of coconut oil could not meet the demand. The soap manufacturing industry indirectly suffered a major blow. The soap manufacturers and merchants jointly sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the Finance Department immediately abolish the special tax on imported coconut oil in order to save the endangered soap industry. The Chamber of Commerce, after learning the facts, yesterday sent a letter to the Finance Department, stating that the Chamber of Commerce had explained the suffering it had suffered on June 29 of this year and requested that the Finance Department abolish the special tax on imported coconut oil in order to maintain the industrial and commercial enterprises. To this day, the special tax on imported coconut oil has not been abolished, which has a great impact on the soap manufacturing industry. The Chamber of Commerce is requested to investigate and implement the abolition as soon as possible to provide relief. (October 8th)</p>

<p>Patrol Uncovers Robbers</p>
<p>Wei Rongguang, the police chief of the sixth branch of the Xin Zhuang Public Security Bureau in the county's third district, was patrolling the eastern market of the town at around 2:00 a.m. on the 9th when he found two suspicious men. He took them back to the station for interrogation and detention. The next day at dawn, a woman came to visit, acting suspiciously. The police detained her, and after questioning by Inspector Dong, she confessed that one of the men was Pei Liu, 36 years old, from Funing. He had arrived in the town yesterday and planned to go to the Chai Bao coffin in the Hengtang area north of the town to retrieve seven rifles. The other man was named Xu Guifu, who was his sworn brother. Xu Guifu confessed the same as Pei. The woman, Xu Pan, was Pei's wife, from Changzhou. She had decided to come to Xin from the Yaolang area of Suzhou by boat to transport the guns. There was also a socket rifle and 181 bullets on the boat. Inspector Dong also seized these together. On the morning of the 10th, they were sent to the county bureau for interrogation. Director He learned that Xu Guifu was a thief and that the guns were robbed by Pei and others from the Fanhai New Town in Zhejiang Province. They had decided to take them out and commit crimes elsewhere. After confessing the whereabouts of the accomplices, Director He immediately sent Detective Yang Shijie, along with detectives Wang Guohua, Wei Yunhui, and Sun Shaoqing, to Shanghai. They went to No. 1 Kangnaot Road in Xiaosha, together with Detective Zhu of the Gordon Road Police Station, and arrested Xu Lao Si and Qian Youyu. They were temporarily detained at the police station. Yang and others returned to Songjiang to prepare documents and then went to pick them up for joint interrogation.</p>

<p>The Situation of Celebrating the Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>The celebration meeting of the representatives of all sectors of Wuxian County for the Double Tenth Festival was held at Zhongshan Hall at 9:00 a.m. on the 10th. More than 1,000 representatives from various agencies, schools, and groups attended. The presidium consisted of Division Commander Song Xilian, Wuxian County Magistrate Deng Xianghai, and Party Affairs Commissioner Sun Danchen. After the meeting began as scheduled, Division Commander Song, the chairman of the presidium, reported the significance of the celebration and severely criticized the indifference of the people of Suzhou to the concept of the country, which was truly insensitive. The whole audience was moved for 40 minutes. Then, a celebration of bumper harvests, offering grain and cocoons, was held. After County Magistrate Deng took his seat, the peasant representatives offered grain and cocoons separately. This scene had never been seen before, so the situation at the meeting was even more joyful and encouraging. Then, the opening ceremony of the Wuxian Women's Rescue Training Class, organized by the Women's Association, was held. Ms. Xiang Jianbai, a standing member of the association, reported on the organization's motives and its significance and led more than 100 trainees to take an oath. The meeting also passed a telegram to comfort Chairman Chiang. The meeting adjourned at around 10:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Insurance Issues for Loan Collateral</p>
<p>The six banks in our county, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Xingye Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Industrial Bank, and Continental Bank, have organized insurance for loans secured by rice, beans, and miscellaneous grains, and have formulated eight measures, which will be implemented from the 11th of this month. Due to the fact that it is difficult to implement in practice for the rice and storage industries, discussions have been held several times without success. Therefore, a general meeting of all members was convened at the Storage Industry Association on the 9th to discuss jointly with the banking community to proceed. More than 40 representatives from the rice and storage industries attended the meeting and decided to request: (1) universal insurance must be provided; (2) an insurance agency should be established; (3) insurance policies should be issued; (4) insurance premiums should be reduced. Regarding the storage industry, the insurance organization is quite casual with us. Regarding the rice industry, a formal request has been submitted to the banking community on the 10th, requesting that the established regulations be amended as appropriate where they are difficult to implement.</p>

<p>Call for Relief from the Salt Shortage</p>
<p>The Jiashan salt is an area where Henan and Anhui are free to transport and sell. The annual sales volume is more than 167,000 dans. Since the Ministry ordered district quotas, annual sales have only been divided into more than 40,000. The difference is more than twice as much. Supply cannot meet demand, and there is a salt shortage. Recently, as the quota is about to be met, the price of salt has skyrocketed, jumping from 7 yuan per 100 jin to more than 9 yuan, and there is not much in stock. It is feared that the diet will be light. The County Farmers' Association yesterday sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, calling for the abolition of quotas to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Tragic Murder by Japanese Fishing Vessel</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese fishing boats have often intruded into the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to fish, causing a lot of damage to fishermen. They also act arbitrarily, colliding with our fishing boats, causing shipwrecks and tragedies. On the night of the 5th of this month, the large pair boat of Yu Deyu, a fisherman from Taohua Island in Dinghai, was fishing in the Langjiang waters. Suddenly, a Japanese fishing boat collided head-on. Yu Deyu's large pair boat was unable to avoid it and sank immediately after being hit. Fortunately, another fishing boat rushed to the rescue, and the fishermen were able to survive. However, the owner of the boat, Yu Deyu, was swept away by the waves and died in the belly of a fish. His family was devastated when they heard the news and had no choice but to report to the County Fishermen's Association for relief.</p>

In the fourth district, the rent payment amount will be the original grain minus the fictitious rent and then minus 37.5. In case of disputes, please first ask the township office and the township agricultural association to mediate.</p>
<p>Prolonged Drought Leads to Water Shortage and Epidemics</p>
<p>There has been no rain in Xiaoshan since the middle of last month. The air is extremely dry, causing diphtheria to take advantage of the situation.

<h3>This Year's National Unification: Shanghai Celebrates National Day, Sends Telegram Endorsing Chairman Chiang, Mayor Hosts Chinese and Foreign Guests</h3>
<p>In commemoration of the 25th National Day of the Republic of China, various circles in Shanghai held a celebration rally at the Nanshi Public Education Hall. The Municipal Government, the Two Roads Bureau, the Two Roads Special Party Department, and the Seamen's Party Department also held separate celebration rallies. Mayor Wu hosted Chinese and foreign guests at the Municipal Government Auditorium to celebrate National Day. Government agencies, schools, factories, and businesses all took a day off, and flags were flown throughout the city to mark the occasion. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Celebration Rally of All Circles</p>
<p>The 25th National Day celebration rally of all circles in the city, including party, government, military, agricultural, industrial, commercial, and educational sectors, was held at 10 a.m. on the 10th in the Minglun Hall of the Municipal Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched dozens of police officers to maintain order in the Wenmiao Road area and inside the Public Education Hall. The venue was filled with lanterns and decorations, with small Party and national flags hanging crisscrossed. People from all walks of life flocked to participate, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Attendees</p>
<p>Representatives from various circles attending the rally included Tong Xingbai from the Municipal Party Department, Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government, Liu Wanjun from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union, Wang Xiaolai from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Huang Zhaoxiong from the Municipal Education Bureau (the above formed the central presidium), Sheng Yizhang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Shanghai Office, Tan Gengxin from the Shanghai Audit Office, Xu Xingjia from the Health Bureau, Yin Yong from the Juvenile Practical Speaking Group, Zhang Yichen and Hu Fengxiang from the First Special District Citizens' Association, Huang Xianggu from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, He Yuanming from the Accountants' Association, Ren Bin from the Dental Appliance Workers' Union, Wang Zhenkun from Minli Girls' Middle School, and over a thousand representatives from other agencies and groups. He Yuanming served as master of ceremonies, and Du Mengsen took minutes.</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai's Speech</p>
<p>After the customary salutations, Chairman Tong Xingbai delivered the opening address, stating that this year's National Day is more worthy of celebration and joy than in previous years, as there has been significant progress in politics, military affairs, and all other constructions. He elaborated as follows: (1) The convening of the National Assembly. Since the revolutionary army unified China, all powers of governance have been entrusted to the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. This is a transitional and temporary measure only. Therefore, our party has formulated a program, advanced step by step over the years, and now local autonomy in various regions has been substantially completed. Based on the teachings of the late Premier, the National Assembly is convened, and representatives from various regions are also being produced according to law. It can be held as scheduled in the future, empowering the people and enabling national politics to make greater progress, and the political foundation will be more consolidated. This is the first cause for celebration. (2) The completion of unification. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the country has often been in a state of disintegration. This is the biggest reason for the stagnation of all construction in our country. Therefore, Chairman Chiang, based on his revolutionary spirit, painstakingly promoted national unification. For example, Sichuan, which had never been peacefully governed for more than twenty years, has now turned hostility into amity, and all military and political orders are obeyed by the central government. Yunnan and Guizhou, far in the border areas, each governed themselves, but now they also obey the central government. Most recently, the Liangguang issue was successfully resolved by Chairman Chiang in a political way with his magnanimous spirit. From now on, the borders will be consolidated, and the whole country will be unified. This is the second cause for celebration. However, the current tense situation in diplomacy has caused the country to feel all kinds of constraints. If we want to seek freedom and equality for the nation and the people, we must unite the country from top to bottom and devote ourselves to the country. Everyone should be calm and composed, and in a passionate spirit, be prepared to serve the country in the event of a national crisis. If everyone has the same mind, then its success will exceed our expectations.</p>
<p>Chen Kecheng's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Chen Kecheng, representing the Municipal Government, gave a speech, stating that Mayor Wu was attending a reception for foreign guests at the Municipal Government, and instructed him to attend as his representative. He then shared his thoughts with those present. The Xinhai Revolution was a glorious historical event for our nation. Now, twenty-five years later, unification has been announced as complete, and various constructions are being actively promoted. However, with foreign insults pressing daily, the country's progress is becoming more difficult. Everyone is responsible for saving the country and surviving. The way to save the country is to be down-to-earth and correct the exaggeration. After the Meiji Restoration, Japan jumped to the top of East Asia. After the defeat of Germany, it was broken and bitter, but in a few years, its momentum rose again. The people of those countries were able to work hard from their positions, and earnestly study and progress in everything, enduring hardship and pioneering new paths for the nation. This is enough for us to emulate. In our current position, all opinions, actions, and steps must be placed under the leadership of the central government, not for emotional venting, but for the preparation of strength. That is, physical strength must be tempered and strengthened, material resources must be saved and accumulated, academic strength must be enriched in time, and mental strength must be concentrated and unified, strengthening the power of the government, not blindly acting, not being silent, supporting the will of the leader, and striving for survival.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech full of warnings, stating that today is the Double Tenth Festival. The so-called Double Tenth has an extremely valuable idiom in our country's history that is very suitable for today's needs, namely "ten" years of lessons, "ten" years of accumulation. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the national situation has been in danger and has not been peaceful for a single day. All of our people are seeking the enjoyment of freedom and equality, but the enjoyment of freedom and equality should be based on "ten" years of lessons, "ten" years of accumulation, enduring hardship, and vowing never to forget. The urgent tasks of the country today are (1) the promotion of the New Life Movement, and (2) the promotion of the National Economic Movement. Then, after the "Double Ten" years, the country will definitely be strong, and the people will be prosperous.</p>
<p>Endorsing Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Then, the proposal was discussed and passed to issue a telegram endorsing Chairman Chiang, the text of which is as follows: "The finalization of Liangguang and the completion of unification have laid a firm foundation for national stability and opened up the opportunity for national rejuvenation. This is all due to the Chairman's spiritual inspiration, solidarity, and struggle. We are deeply admired by the great achievements. We hope to uphold the late Premier's teachings of peace, struggle, and saving China, and to seek the success of our party's great policy of freedom and equality. Our people across the country vow to unite our strength to serve our government and leader. We celebrate National Day, and send a telegram of condolences. We hope you will take note. The 25th National Day Commemoration Conference of All Circles in Shanghai bows."</p>
<p>Slogans of the Rally</p>
<p>(1) October 10th is the memorial day for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation! (2) Step up production and construction to enrich national strength! (3) Eliminate the remnant bandits! (4) Support the National Assembly! (5) Support Chairman Chiang, who has worked hard and made great achievements! (6) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! (7) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>The National Day Celebration is Lively (Lin)</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Celebration Rally</h3>
<p>This National Day, the Municipal Government held a celebration rally as ordered, and a colored archway was erected at the Baoshan Road intersection, and patrol police were dispatched along the road to maintain traffic. The national party flag was hung high in front of the Municipal Government, and the party and national flags and red cloth were tied around the four sides of the building, creating a completely new atmosphere. The celebration rally was held at 9 o'clock, and was attended by Mayor Wu, secretaries from various sections and bureaus of the Municipal Government, security teams, district committees, and all staff of the library, museum, and stadium. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting, and Lin Yannan served as the master of ceremonies. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau band played music and performed the customary salutations, the chairman gave a report, the original words of which are as follows: "Today is the 25th National Day of the Republic of China. The Republic of China is exactly twenty-five years old today, just like a person who has grown from childhood to adulthood. It has gone through many difficulties in the past twenty-five years, witnessed the world war in the past fifteen years, which shocked him. In the past twenty-five years, it has gone through countless internal wars and chaos. In the past twenty-five years, it has encountered the most serious national crisis in history. China, as a twenty-five-year-old young country, has suffered so much stimulation, so many beatings, and is still able to survive under barely healthy conditions today. We cannot but thank God. At the same time, we should never forget the people of the whole country who have directly and indirectly sacrificed blood for the construction of the country in the past twenty-five years, especially the revolutionary martyrs, because they sacrificed for freedom and equality, so that we can build the country on this foundation. Their sacrifices in those years are our example today, our model, so that we know how to be loyal to the country, loyal to the people, sacrifice ourselves to save the country, and revive the nation. We have not held a National Day celebration for many years, the reason is that the country is in trouble. The reason why the National Day celebration is held this year is not because the national crisis has been resolved or reduced, but for two reasons: (1) Because this year the country is truly unified, and we have the foundation, belief, and hope to resolve the national crisis. (2) This year is the 25th anniversary, which is called the "silver anniversary" in Europe and the United States. How many people can have a silver anniversary of twenty-five years? Therefore, at the time of the 25th National Day of the Republic of China, we should not only hold a celebration, but also encourage all the citizens of Shanghai to rejoice, expressing that we have the belief and determination to resolve the national crisis, so that we will be happier when we hold the National Day in the future. The government has issued an order this year for the whole country to hold a National Day celebration, which is also the reason. This year is the 25th anniversary of the Republic of China. We feel that the past twenty-five years have passed quickly, but twenty-five years is a very long time. In a century, it has accounted for a quarter. We have seen many countries in the world, which have been revived after they were destroyed, or have become strong again after they have weakened. Their efforts are only a few twenty-five years. For example, the United States has been established for only six twenty-five years, but it has become the richest and strongest country in the world today. After the Franco-Prussian War, France was able to wipe out the shame of the city, and it only took two twenty-five years. Germany was惨惨惨惨惨败 in this world war, and it has been复兴 in less than twenty-five years. The Soviet Union succeeded in the revolution, and to this day, countries around the world dare not underestimate it, and it has been less than twenty-five years. Japan's restoration to today's position has also been less than three twenty-five years. The prosperity of Italy today makes us want to see the heyday of the Roman Empire, which is also less than twenty-five years. The British people's management of the country, and the ingenuity and firm and沉着 characteristics of coping with international affairs, have led to the strength of the British Empire today. All of these are enough for us to learn from. All of these are because their countries have a party with an ideology, a leader who leads the whole country, and a strong government. With these three treasures, the country will flourish, the dead will be revived, and the weak will become strong. Our Republic of China, in the past, may be because it lacked these three treasures, or it had these three treasures, but it could not recognize, support, and use them as tools to save the country and revive the nation. Now we have long had a party with an ideology, a leader who can lead us, and a strong government. The people of the whole country are gradually recognizing these three treasures. At this time, we must strengthen the "awareness" of the people of the whole country, and let the people of the whole country come to support the party, support the leader, and support the government. If the awareness of the whole country is enough to express its enthusiasm for support, then these three treasures will surely be able to exert their great power to resolve the current national crisis, build the country, and revive the nation. Shanghai is China's only big city, and it has always been in a leading position in the country. International observation is close, and the stimulation is also deep. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should arouse the people of the whole country when holding the National Day celebration this year, expressing their support and trust to the party, the leader, and the government, and expressing their loyalty to the party, loyalty to the leader, and loyalty to the government. Commemorating the National Day is more meaningful, especially to restore our ancestors' self-confidence in creating culture, catch up with the modern world, and build a new China, then the future of the Republic of China will be bright.

<h3>Memorial for Premier's Ordeal in London: Representatives from All Circles Convene Meeting Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The National Society reported that yesterday (the 11th) was the 40th anniversary of the Premier's ordeal in London. The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, in order to commemorate the Premier's revolutionary spirit, specially convened representatives from all circles to hold a memorial meeting in the department's auditorium at 10 a.m. yesterday. Xing Yan chaired the meeting, Du Mengsen recorded, and Wu Di served as the master of ceremonies. The meeting is described as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Xing Yan from the Municipal Party Department, Long Peiyun from the General Labor Union, Lin Kecong from the Municipal Women's Association, Huang Xianggu from the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, Li Weiliang from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Du Mengsen from the Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, Zhu Shide from the National Products Maintenance Association, Li Weixiong from the Juvenile Official Speaking Group, Zhang Sheng from the Hudong District Citizens' Association, Yu Yaoqiu from the Baoshan Native Place Association, Dai Youheng from the Taicang Native Place Association, Huang Tiren from the Haiyan Native Place Association, Zhao Zhenhui from the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, and more than 200 representatives from various agencies, groups, schools, and party departments at all levels.</p>
<p>After the chairman reported and performed the customary salutations, the chairman first reported that today is the day when the Premier suffered in London. It was because the Premier worked hard on the revolutionary work that he was envied by the Qing government. The Premier's revolutionary intention was during the Sino-French War, and the actual action was after the Sino-Japanese War. Because he was subjected to many stimuli, he organized the Revive China Society. At first, he used peaceful means such as petitions and memorials, hoping that the Manchu Qing government would improve and reform. As a result, the authorities did not adopt it, and he decided that the corrupt Manchu Qing government must be overthrown. There was the first uprising in Guangzhou, but unfortunately it failed. The Premier then went to Japan, the United States, and then to London. He was lured into prison by the Chinese Embassy in England and was planned to be sent back to China for punishment. If he had unfortunately been解回 to China at this time, not only would his life have been lost, but the revolution would also have been interrupted. At that time, fortunately, the Premier's teacher, Kang Deli, rescued him, and he was able to escape. Today, to commemorate the Premier's ordeal, we must recognize the following three points: (1) To realize the Three Principles of the People, overthrow imperialism, complete nationalism, convene the National Assembly, implement democracy, and promote the National Economic Construction Movement to achieve people's livelihood. (2) Learn from the Premier's fearless revolutionary spirit, and continue the Premier's unfinished will with an indomitable fighting spirit. (3) Support the revolutionary leader Chairman Chiang, inherit the Premier's will, realize the Three Principles of the People, and維　the integrity of the territory and sovereignty of the Republic of China. Then, he shouted slogans, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Flying Flags and Guarding: All circles in the city, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the memorial meeting convened by the Municipal Party Department yesterday, also followed the memorial methods stipulated by the central government and flew flags to commemorate the event. The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the police departments of the two concessions, in order to prevent unscrupulous people from taking the opportunity to make trouble, implemented strict precautions.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Xinzhi County Celebrate the Harvest</h3>
<p>A Celebration Meeting Was Held at Jinshan Yard, and Ping Opera Will Be Performed Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Xinzhi County Harvest Thanksgiving Meeting was held the day before yesterday (the 10th) at the Daguan Building in Jinshan Yard. Representatives from various agencies and groups and more than 2,000 farmers attended. The presidium included Zhang Yi, Sun Zhongji, Yang Zhuoyun, Gu Zengfu, and Huang Xingren. The chairman reported, stating that our country is based on agriculture, and the abundance of the harvest is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. This year's harvest is abundant, and most people are happy and encouraged. All circles in Xinzhi are taking advantage of the Double Tenth Festival to hold a harvest celebration meeting. On the one hand, they are celebrating peace, and on the other hand, they are promoting agricultural affairs. After the abundant harvest, they are promoting frugality, so as to enrich the livelihood and save the economic national crisis. Then, Zhang Jingye, a standing committee member of the County Party Department, gave guidance, stating that the harvest is of course worth celebrating. It is more meaningful to celebrate the harvest during National Day. Since the autumn harvest is abundant, do not waste it. We should propose the creation of warehouses or savings to prepare for emergencies. Moreover, at this time, the national crisis is serious, and there is no time to save the country. All of our people should devote themselves to production and eliminate waste, so as to solve the economic national crisis. Yang Zhuoyun gave a speech, with many encouragements. Then he shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting. A lantern show was held in the evening. The streets of Beiqiao and the nearby villages were brightly lit. The goods were displayed in the 士貨 market, mostly agricultural tools and furniture. The trade of jars, pottery, and woodwork was the most. Ping opera was performed starting yesterday, and 10,000 people watched, and the situation was even more lively.</p>
<h3>As the Situation Eases, Rice Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News, in the week before October 10th, the situation in Shanghai was serious. Rice shops and residents all over the city bought food to prevent emergencies. Therefore, sales increased sharply, and rice prices also soared, reaching more than one yuan per dan. As a result, rice boats from all gangs were swept away in a few hours. It is estimated that the first and second batches of shipping merchants have made a lot of profits, and they are all overjoyed. Therefore, river rice from all gangs is coming in an endless stream. There are ships everywhere in the Suzhou River and along the Huangpu River, and the goods are piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Plummet</p>
<p>Recently, as the situation in Shanghai has eased and people's hearts have settled, and when the rumors were urgent, residents had enough food reserves, so the supply of rice exceeded the demand. When the North and South markets opened yesterday, the North market fell by seven or eight jiao per dan, and the South market fell by five jiao, but the number of transactions was still few.</p>
<p>Investigating Rice Reserves</p>
<p>In order to balance market prices and ensure sufficient food for the citizens of Shanghai, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specially sent Yan Wenkai, director of the Food and Grain Section of the Fourth Section, to conduct an investigation into the amount of rice stored in various firms and warehouses throughout the city. Dagong News reporters inquired with various rice industry groups yesterday and found that the total amount of new and old rice and ke xian rice has increased from 300,000 dan to more than 560,000 dan. Moreover, new japonica rice from the inland has entered the market one after another, and there is no need to panic about the people's food.</p>

The building is scheduled to be completed and occupied within next year, with the office opening at the new address on January 4, 27th year of the Republic of China. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: The ceremony venue was set up at the entrance of the building on the Bund, with the national flag and party flag hanging intertwined above the entrance, adorned with green cypress and colorful flowers. Inside the venue, five-colored cloth curtains and international flags were hung. The bamboo fence was also decorated with red cloth. The chairman's platform was on the left, facing north with a desk. Behind it was a white foundation stone, suspended by iron chains. The stone's surface was engraved with the words "Commemorating the Foundation of the Bank of China Building, Chairman Song Ziwen, General Manager Song Hanzhang, October 10, 25th Year of the Republic of China," and other inscriptions. The long corridor to the left of the platform was for female guests, and the area behind the platform was for the chairman and foreign guests. Below, were seats for guests and news reporters.

<p>Song Hanzhang's Speech:</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China, at the Groundbreaking Ceremony for the New Building: "Distinguished guests, today, our Bank of China is holding the groundbreaking ceremony for its new building, coinciding with the National Day holiday. I feel very happy. The Bank of China was born in the same year as the Republic of China. The past history of the Bank of China is closely related to the past history of the Republic of China. The future work of the Bank of China is even more closely related to the development prospects of the Republic of China. Therefore, we feel particularly meaningful to hold the groundbreaking ceremony today. I am one of the preparers of the Bank of China. In the past fifteen years, although my position in the Bank of China has been different from time to time, I have not been separated from the Bank of China for a single day. It can also be said that I have a twenty-five-year marriage history with the Bank of China. This year is our silver wedding anniversary. Although I am very familiar with the history of the Bank of China's development, I will not mention the old events today. I will only say a few words about the facts of the Bank of China's General Management Office's relocation over the years to show a glimpse of the various changes that the Bank of China has undergone. The Bank of China was transformed from the former Qing Dynasty Qing Bank. The Wuchang Uprising in the Xinhai Revolution, responded to by the Southeast, the Qing Bank ceased operations. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Nanjing Provisional Government ordered the organization of the Bank of China to inherit the Qing Bank. The address was at 5-1 Hankou Road in Shanghai, where the Bank of China's General Management Office and the Shanghai Branch are now crowded together. In August of the first year of the Republic of China, the General Management Office of the Bank of China was officially established in Beijing. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the General Office moved to Shanghai again. The address is where we are gathering now. Two years ago, because the houses here were dilapidated, we prepared to thoroughly renovate them. The General Office and the Shanghai Branch moved to 50 Hankou Road again. In less than fifteen years, it has been a full circle. This time, we held a groundbreaking ceremony, and all the equipment was simplified. The guests we invited are all representatives of the financial community. As for the gentlemen from the political, business, gentry, and academic circles, we did not dare to trouble even one person, because we felt that on National Day, all sectors have gatherings of their peers or colleagues to celebrate together. Our comrades in the financial community have a strong interest in each other's work and progress. It is a good opportunity to invite you to come and give us advice, and we can also think about the past situation of the financial community and the future responsibilities. I will not say more. Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, to lay the foundation stone for us personally. Mrs. Song (Zhang Leyi) will personally place our commemorative box under the foundation stone."</p>
<p>Song Ziwen's Speech:</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, at the Groundbreaking Ceremony for the New Building: "Distinguished guests, today the Bank of China is holding a groundbreaking ceremony for its new building. I am very grateful for your presence and participation. On behalf of the Bank of China, I sincerely welcome and thank you for your kindness. For several years, the Bank of China has felt that the original building was too small and the equipment was simple. However, for the sake of saving money, we reluctantly made do. Year after year, we procrastinated until the old house really could not be made do, and we decided to build a new building. As for the exterior and interior appearance and equipment after the completion of the new building, the architect has already published an article in various newspapers, which is well-organized and colorful. However, I have a word that I must declare on behalf of the Bank of China, that is, no matter how grand the architect's article says, the Bank of China does not want to build a magnificent building to show our financial strength. Our only purpose is to increase the efficiency of our work and the convenience of our customers. As for the effort of decorating the facade, we are unwilling to do. The board of directors repeatedly reduced the original budget for the construction cost to 50%, which clearly shows our intention. What we should pay attention to today is not the material observation, but the spiritual significance. I have gained several impressions from today's groundbreaking ceremony. The first impression is the relationship between the bank and the public's credit. As you all know, the Bank of China was born in the same year as the Republic of China. From the first year of the Republic of China to October of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the period passed is only about twenty-five years. The capital of the Bank of China has increased from more than 2.6 million yuan to 40 million yuan. The issuance of banknotes has increased from 1 million yuan to 36 million yuan. Loans have increased from 3.7 million yuan to 77.6 million yuan. Deposits have increased from 3 million yuan to 93.7 million yuan. The total number of branches, offices, and agency houses has increased from three to two hundred and eight. The progress can be described as rapid. Today we hold the groundbreaking ceremony. From the perspective of the general public and the customers of the Bank of China, they should feel that their long-term love for the Bank of China and their painstaking efforts to maintain the Bank of China can be said to have yielded satisfactory results. From the perspective of the directors and employees of the Bank of China, they should feel that our work over the years has been recognized by society. In the future, when the new building is completed and the equipment is more perfect, we should especially redouble our efforts and fulfill our duty to serve society. The second impression is the necessity of cooperation among peers. We feel that developing China's industry and international trade is a huge responsibility that cannot be handled by one or two banks. We must unite all financial institutions and pool our efforts to achieve results. Furthermore, the business of banks is not limited. Looking at the past twenty-five years, the deposits and loans of the Bank of China have indeed increased greatly, but the business of other banks has also increased significantly. China is vast and rich in resources, and all industries and commerce are in their infancy. The opportunities for development are just beginning. For the sake of developing China's future, not only domestic banks, but also foreign banks in China and financial institutions abroad have the possibility and need for cooperation. Today, you represent the financial institutions in this city and participate in the groundbreaking ceremony of the Bank of China, which can be said to be the manifestation of this spirit of cooperation. I feel very happy. Finally, what I want to talk about is the attitude that the financial community should take under the environment. We are holding the groundbreaking ceremony today at a time of economic and international turmoil. Since the winter of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the depression has spread all over the world and has not yet recovered. In addition to the economic panic, the international political situation is becoming more and more dangerous. Countries are actively preparing for war, and there is a tendency to be on the verge of war. However, under this harsh environment, we are still actively building the bank building, which can show that no matter how things change in the future, we should think from a big and long-term perspective, move forward bravely, and never give up. We feel that the solidity of the foundation stone laid today can show the trust in the great and bright future of our Republic of China."</p>

<h3>Universal Dispensary Holds Two Grand Ceremonies the Day Before Yesterday: 30th Anniversary of Establishment and Inauguration of New Building</h3>
<p>Universal Dispensary Co., Ltd., held its 30th anniversary and the inauguration ceremony of the new building, as well as the unveiling ceremony of the Song Mao Memorial Hall, on Double Ten Day. The details have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. It is reported that the unveiling ceremony of the Song Mao Memorial Hall was held at 10:00 AM that morning, with Huang Renzhi officiating the unveiling. In the afternoon, the 30th anniversary and inauguration ceremony were held. Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, representing President Zhou Yichun, Director Xu Peihuang of the Public Utilities Bureau, Superintendent Zhu Changnian of the Jianghai Customs, and guests from various circles, both Chinese and Western, including Shi Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Fang Jiaobo, Song Hanzhang, Huang Renzhi, and Yuan Lideng, totaled more than 7,000 people. After the meeting, the receptionists led the guests to visit the various floors and the soap manufacturing demonstration, and were entertained with refreshments, and each sent a souvenir gift and a commemorative special issue. The guests were extremely crowded on that day. After 2:00 PM, guests and onlookers at the Fuzhou Road entrance gathered in the middle of the road, causing traffic to be blocked. The grand occasion was unprecedented. The details are divided and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Auditorium:</p>
<p>The auditorium was located on the sixth floor of the new building, with a large area that could accommodate more than 1,000 people. The head was set up with the chairman's platform, with the party and national flags and the portrait of the Premier hung above. The platform was full of souvenirs sent by various circles, including gold and silver shields, silverware, Fujian lacquerware porcelain, stone carvings, and other items more than a hundred pieces. The four walls were covered with inscriptions from party and national dignitaries and celebrities from various circles and groups, as well as mirror screens and other items, which were dazzling and beautiful. On the large cool platform on the roof outside the auditorium, there was a music performance by the orphanage military band.</p>
<p>Unveiling Ceremony:</p>
<p>The unveiling ceremony of the Song Mao Memorial Hall was held at 10:00 AM that morning. After the meeting was held as scheduled, the managing director of the company, Gao Hanqing, gave a speech reporting on the significance of the memorial hall. Then Huang Renzhi gave a speech. Then, the receptionists led Mr. Huang to the memorial hall on the third floor to unveil it. Finally, the family members of Mr. Xiang gave a thank-you speech and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Meeting: Before 2:00 PM that afternoon, guests continued to arrive, and the meeting place was almost impossible to find a foothold. When the bell rang, the meeting was held as scheduled. First, Dr. Yan Fuqing, chairman of the company, gave a speech. Then Mr. Xiang Wu, general manager of the company, gave a speech. Then, Minister Wu, representing Zhou Yichun, gave a speech in turn. Then, guests Xu Peihuang, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Jiaobo, and Chen Jun, the representative of the Jianghai Customs, gave speeches in succession. Finally, Mr. Lu Zhixue, the standing director of the company, gave a thank-you speech and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Orderly Visit: After the meeting was adjourned, the receptionists led the guests along the predetermined route, from the south escalator to the fifth floor to have refreshments and watch the soap manufacturing demonstration. Then, they went to the fourth floor to visit the human physiological model. The floor was equipped with a health and safety section, stationed with doctors and nurses, to prevent accidents and provide first aid and treatment at any time. The interior decoration of the Song Mao Memorial Hall on the third floor was completely in the ancient Chinese style, with painted beams and carved pillars, which were extremely solemn and magnificent. The portrait of Mr. Xiang Songmao was hung at the head, and the plaque "Extreme Nature Over People" awarded to Mr. Xiang by the President was hung in front of the portrait. When the guests arrived here, they were mostly in awe. The rest were the company's various department offices. The middle-level cargo storage was also an office. Around the large viewing building, there were temporary displays of goods from major companies. The entire bottom floor was the business department, which was richly decorated and innovatively furnished. After the guests obtained gifts here, they exited from the Henan Road entrance.</p>
<p>Crowded Situation: After 2:00 PM that afternoon, the guests were extremely crowded. The elevator could not accommodate them, and most of them went up the escalator in an orderly manner. However, the number of people became more and more, and it was difficult to enter for a while. Some onlookers also gathered in it, causing traffic to be blocked outside the gate on Fuzhou Road. The trams could hardly run. The Central Patrol House dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to maintain order, and traffic was restored. Many guests could not enter due to excessive crowding, and the company was very sorry for this.</p>
<p>Filming: The company decided to make a sound film of the various situations of the ceremony, the postures of the speakers and parliamentarians, the decoration of the auditorium and memorial hall, and the crowded situation of guests at the entrance and exit, to commemorate it. It is heard that the Chinese National Goods Film Official Communication Service Agency undertook it.</p>
<p>Aircraft Celebration: In order to celebrate the grand ceremony and expand publicity, the company specially ordered a giant aircraft from Eurasia Airlines to circle the new building several times during the meeting, and then flew over Shanghai and dropped a lot of leaflets with gifts. It is rare for commercial aircraft to distribute publicity materials in the air. Soap Making Performance: The company has a soap making performance on the fifth floor, which is divided into (1) Mixing, (2) Grinding, (3) Pressing, (4) Cutting, (5) Molding (6) Packaging. Everything is the same as the procedure of mass production. The machines are driven by electric motors, and the female workers wear white and light blue work clothes and hats. The soap made in the performance is the company's most superior rich and precious head soap, so those who pass through it almost enter the fragrant country.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Speeches: (1) Speech by Dr. Yan Fuqing: "Today is the 30th anniversary of Universal. Thirty years ago, when our company was founded, not only did most people not believe in Western medicine, but they also did not understand Western medicine. The difficult situation can be imagined. Later, although there was a slight development, the Western medicine industry was completely of a trading nature, equivalent to brokers, but they took foreign medicine to modify it and used it as local medicine. Later, our company manufactured it ourselves, and both capital and talent were difficult. However, Mr. Xiang Songmao was determined at that time not to be afraid of difficulties, so that there is today's development. Now there are five branches in this city and fourteen branches in other places. There are four manufacturing plants, not only making medicine, but also making raw materials. Now we have to find ways to make mass production. Foreign pharmaceutical companies are progressing very quickly, all because they focus on research. Our company has always attached great importance to research. Now it is donating a Songde Hall to the National Medical College, specializing in pharmaceutical research and cultivating national pharmaceutical talents. Mr. Xiang Songmao saw the development of the new pharmaceutical industry today thirty years ago. Although Mr. Songmao is no longer in this world, this spirit is very worthy of our admiration. (2) Speech by President Zhou: "Today, on behalf of Minister Wu, I am very honored to participate in your company's 30th anniversary and the inauguration ceremony of the new building. I have heard Dr. Yan and General Manager Xiang talk about Universal's 30 years of experience and its mission. I have found that medicinal materials are roughly divided into two types, one is mineral and the other is plant. Our country has the most herbal medicines, while foreign countries have more mineral medicines of gold and stone, and they do not pay much attention to herbal medicines. They have recently paid attention to research, such as rhubarb and ephedra. They have adopted our country's products, but there are too many Chinese herbal medicines. We should use scientific methods to research and make new national medicines, because Western medicines are too expensive and cannot be purchased by ordinary people, so new national medicines are needed for relief. If we want to produce products that can be popularized, there are two conditions, one is to be genuine and reasonably priced, and the other is to do our best to promote them. In the past, many national goods could not be sold well, all because they were crude and shoddy. I hope that your company will research and refine them, and if the price is cheap and the goods are good, they will be promoted and developed. Thirty years ago, your company had a capital of 20,000, and after 30 years, it has become 1.5 million. This is the result of Mr. Xiang Songmao's serious dedication to a cause. I hope that at your company's 50th anniversary, the capital will increase from 1.5 million to 15 million, etc. (The other speeches are limited to the scope and are not recorded.)"</p>

<h3>Yesterday Afternoon Japanese Troops Still Cross the Border to Deploy Posts; Three Japanese Warships Entered the Port Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the situation of the Japanese troops in the area of North Sichuan Road and the urban area of this city has become more and more eased in recent days, and the rumors in the market have gradually subsided. Everything seems to have returned to the state before the sailor was arrested on the 23rd of last month. Yesterday morning, there were still a few armed Japanese soldiers guarding the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, the intersection of Dixiwei Road, near the Tientong'an Railway Station, and the Japanese troops' branch posts. The situation was much easier than before. Armored vehicles and military vehicles still patrolled back and forth, occasionally crossing the border into the urban area of Jiangwan Road. From 2:00 PM, armed troops were deployed across the border in Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road and other places in the urban area, and there were four or five patrol teams patrolling across the border. The situation was slightly more tense than in the morning, but this kind of situation of withdrawing and deploying from time to time is not from yesterday. As for the situation of the Japanese troops in the Japanese brewery behind the Sixty-Three Garden, it remains the same. The Japanese elementary school at the intersection of Shigaota Road and Jixiang Road held an autumn sports meeting yesterday. In order to protect the Japanese residents, the Japanese troops deployed posts nearby, and the number of people increased. As for the rumors that Japanese plainclothes teams are出沒 in the market, it is still difficult to confirm. However, it seems that there are more plainclothes Japanese people coming and going in the area of North Sichuan Road and the urban area than before.</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reported that between 8:00 and 9:00 AM yesterday morning, three more Japanese cruisers entered the port in this city, namely (1) Sendai, (2) Nagara, and (3) Izu. Nagara and Sendai were opened from Sasebo and entered the port at 8:35 AM and docked in the Yangshupu River at 9:40 AM. The other Izu was opened from Lushun and entered the port at 7:45 AM and sailed to the Shiliupu River and anchored at 10:00 AM. Izu loaded a large amount of coal to Shanghai. The three ships had more than 390 sailors.</p>

He immediately returned to Shanghai. Now that his mission in China has been completed, he took the Shanghai Maru from Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 10th with Secretary Tagami to return to China and report to Foreign Minister Arita. Kuwajima went to the Huishan Wharf to board the ship at 8:30 AM. Wang Changchun, commissioner of the municipal government, Zhou Jue, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Waksugi, counselor of the Japanese Embassy and consul general in Shanghai, Tajiri and Yoshioka, assistant military attachés of the army, and assistant naval attachés, Sub-consul Okino and Fukui, and representatives of the Japanese residents all went to the port to see them off.</p>
<p>Kita: Major General Kita, the army attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 10th by the overnight express train from Beijing. After getting off at the North Station, he returned to the official residence on Wuding Road to rest. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Beijing to assist Ambassador Kawagoe in discussing Sino-Japanese issues with our diplomatic authorities. After arriving in Shanghai, Kita met with Commander and Vice Admiral Kikawa of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai and Consul General Wakasugi in Shanghai to discuss matters.</p>
<p>Uchida: Uchida, the Japanese consul general in Fuzhou, visited Ambassador Kawagoe in Beijing and returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Because he admired the scenic spots of the Six Bridges and Three Temples in West Lake, he went to Hangzhou for sightseeing. He returned to Shanghai immediately. It is reported that Uchida took the Japanese ship Changsha Maru from Shanghai at 12:00 noon on the 11th and set off for Fujian. The Japanese Consulate General in this city sent representatives to the Osaka Wharf to see him off.</p>
<h3>Two Standing Committee Members of the Guangdong Seamen's Branch Liang and Wang Come to Shanghai to Report</h3>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Union is one of the most sound and special unions in our country. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, the Hong Kong-Guangdong General Strike led by the union shocked China and foreign countries at the time and is still deeply imprinted in the minds of the world. However, during the Chen Jitang era in Guangdong, the seamen in Guangdong and Guangxi were deeply moved by the prestige of the current commissioner of the union, Yang Xiaotian. Although they were eager to return to the central government and serve the party and the country, they were ultimately unable to fulfill their wishes due to environmental pressure. In July of this year, Chen Jitang resigned. The commissioner of the union, Yang Xiaotian, believed that the obstacle to unifying maritime transport had been removed. He requested the central government to send Wang Jiyi, the design committee member and secretary of the union, to inspect and comfort them. After Wang returned to Shanghai, the union revoked the Guangzhou Haichang Branch and sent Huang Huilong, Liang Guoying, Zhai Oumin, Ma Bolin, and other nine people as committee members, and appointed Huang Liang, Wang, and other three people as standing committee members, setting a deadline to establish the Guangzhou Branch. The newly appointed committee members were officially sworn in in Guangdong on October 1. Now they have sent Liang Guoying and Zhu Oumin to Shanghai to report and ask for instructions.</p>

<h3>Major Robbery on Meyuan Road: Robbers' Confessions Obtained</h3>
<p>On the 13th of last month, at 12:30 AM, the home of Jiang Defu, who works as a rickshaw puller, at No. 1 Beihangji Lane, Meyuan Road, Zhabei, was robbed for three hours, resulting in a loss of over 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, the police of the Foreign Settlement arrested a large number of robbers and recovered some of the stolen goods, as previously reported. The following are excerpts from the confessions of the robbers obtained by the Detective Squad of the Xinzha Branch in Zhabei: (1) Fang Jinfeng (female) confessed: I am 16 years old, from Changzhou, living at No. 2 Peideli Lane, Yaojia Stone Bridge. I work in a yarn factory. That day (i.e., the 8th) at around 8 PM, I went to a place near the Sun Temple to pick up clothes. Zhang San's mistress dragged me in. Miao Lin is my lover. I work in the factory during the day and return in the evening, so I don't know what he does. If you want to know where he is, ask Huang Xilin. Huang Xilin confessed: I am 39 years old, from Changzhou, living at No. 8 Jinling Road, Datong Road. I buy and sell second-hand goods. On the evening of the 8th, because the Shanghai market was bad, I sent my child to Changzhou. I don't know why they arrested me. Miao Lin is in the same business, so I know him. Yesterday, I met him on Robison Road near the big chiming clock. He lives at No. 3850 Daxu Lane, Robison Road. Jiang Zhiyong confessed: I am 28 years old, from Tongzhou, living at No. 205 Menggu Road. I buy and sell second-hand goods. I have an apprentice named Yitu. On the morning of September 14th, around 8 AM, he brought me six pieces of silverware (i.e., two pairs of vases, a wine pot, and a commemorative cup). I asked him where they came from. He said they were from a ship. I told him not to leave them with me. If they are easy to sell, go sell them. I didn't go to the robbery at the Jiang family, nor did I get any money. On the 2nd of this month, Yitu came again, and I helped him call a rickshaw. I went to Yang Amao's place to call a rickshaw. Yang Amao confessed: I am 47 years old, from Yancheng, living in Hexu, Huakang Road. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, around 1 PM, Yitu came to my house and said he wanted a rickshaw. Because my eyes hurt, I called Xiaoyuanzi (i.e., Tang Xiaoyuanzi, also known as Tang Ruyuan) to pull it. I don't know how the rickshaw was abandoned at Nanyang Bridge in Nanshi. Later, the rickshaw company owner (i.e., Jiang Defu) found it. Two days later, they said the Foreign Settlement had arrested robbers and came to my house to arrest Xiaoyuanzi and took me away. Zhang Xuejing (i.e., Xiaolaohan) confessed: I am 24 years old, from Yancheng, living at No. 4 Hengji Lane, Meyuan Road. I make a living pulling a rickshaw. On the morning of September 13th, Tang Xiaoyuanzi, Yang Amao, etc., asked me if the Jiang family had any money. I said they didn't have money, but his son Wei Kun was getting married and had some gold and silver jewelry. Therefore, Tang Xiaoyuanzi, Zixiang, Miao Lin (captured by the Central Police Station of the Foreign Settlement), and six or seven others went to the Jiang rickshaw company to rob them. Miao Lin brought the gun. After the robbery, Zixiang brought eight cotton blankets to my house. The next morning, around 6 AM, he took them to pawn. He gave me six yuan. At that time, Miao Lin had four guns and told Xiaoyuanzi to pull rickshaw No. 168 to the Foreign Settlement. They abandoned the rickshaw at Nanyang Bridge, Jiala Road. Miao Lin and Xiaoyuanzi took the guns away. According to the victim Jiang Defu, on the 4th of this month, Detective Feng from the Central Police Station of the Foreign Settlement came to arrest Xiaoyuanzi. He also said that someone had abandoned a rickshaw at Nanyang Bridge. At that time, I went to identify it as correct. I also went to the police station to identify the robbers. One of the robbers was wearing a copper basin hat, which belonged to my son Wei Kun, etc. After verifying the confessions, the team escorted them to the Xinzha Branch Bureau and then to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fire at Yixin Fluff Factory: People Injured</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiangning Falls to Death; Losses Reach Over 60,000 Yuan</p>
<p>At 1:50 AM this morning, a fire broke out at the Yixin Fluff Factory at No. 25 Singapore Road, Western Shanghai, due to an electrical short in a motor. The fire quickly spread and broke through the roof. Workers at the factory were still working and rushed to escape, resulting in workers Han Zhongliang (30 years old), Mao Xizhen (20 years old), and apprentice Feng Qisheng (18 years old) being seriously injured when they jumped from the second floor. Another worker, Zhang Xiangning, fell to his death when he jumped. The remaining injured were taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade of the Shanghai Municipal Council responded to the alarm and rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. It took three hours to put out the fire, which destroyed six rooms of the front factory building and goods, resulting in a loss of over 60,000 yuan. It is reported that the factory has fire insurance and is currently seeking compensation from the insurance company.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Run Over and Killed by Bus</h3>
<p>Chen Xinfa's Tragic Death</p>
<p>Chen Xinfa, a 17-year-old youth from Ningbo, was an apprentice at the Chai Dingmao Soy Sauce Shop at No. 63-65 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. On the morning of the Double Tenth Festival, at 7 AM, he took over one hundred yuan in banknotes from the shop and rode his bicycle to the Wanjiang Soy Sauce Shop on Rue de la Gare to exchange the banknotes for ajinomoto. At 8 AM, as he was riding north on Route de Villermont and turning east at the intersection of Route Cardinal Mercier, a French-owned No. 22 bus, number 821, traveling between Waiyangjing Bridge and Xujiahui, driven by driver Zhang Rongcai (22 years old, from Yangzhou, living at No. 127 Xinxin Lane, Dapu Bridge), was heading straight west. Chen was turning and unable to avoid the bus. Initially, the right front fender of the bus collided with the bicycle, knocking Chen to the ground. Chen's head and upper body, along with the bicycle, were run over by the wheels of the bus and became stuck under the bus. The bus stopped. The police investigated and called for passersby to lift the front of the bus, and Chen and the bicycle were pulled out. Chen had a broken head, brain matter splattered, and was dead. The police recorded the bus and driver's numbers and reported to the Zikawei Police Station. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy, pending a forensic examination by the Second Special District Court today.</p>
<h3>Overdose of Sleeping Pills: Death by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Wang Guangzhu, 34 years old, son of the late Wang Sheng-san (Fenghao), former Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of Zhejiang Province and founder of Guanghua University in Shanghai, is currently an accountant at the Jianqiao Aviation School in Hangzhou. He is married to Ms. Ding, granddaughter of the late famous physician Ding Ganren of Menghe, and lives in Hangzhou with his family. They have two children. Recently, due to discord between Wang's wife, Ms. Ding, and his aunt, Wang was in a difficult position and his nerves were stimulated, causing him to suffer from heart disease. Due to discomfort, he came to Shanghai and stayed at the home of a relative, Yang Jiemei, at No. 559 Avenue Foch in the French Concession, where he sought medical treatment. Because he suffered from insomnia, he had to take sleeping pills every night to fall asleep. On the evening of the 8th, at 11 PM, he took an overdose of sleeping pills before going to bed, resulting in poisoning. He did not wake up until noon the next day. At 2 PM that afternoon, his relative Yang Jiemei took him to the General Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Route Haig. Due to the deep poisoning, treatment was ineffective. He died about two hours after admission, at 4:15 PM. The hospital reported the death to the French police as required, and detectives were sent to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. His wife, Ding, is in Hangzhou, and the family was notified by telegram. On the 10th, the police reported to the Second Special District Court Procuratorate. Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Peng Lang, arrived at the funeral home at 10:30 AM. Wang Guang, a section chief in the European and American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, filed a request to waive the autopsy. After the forensic doctor examined the body, he took his seat and questioned Wang's wife, Ms. Wang Ding, and Yang Jiemei, who sent him to the hospital. He then ruled that Wang Guangzhu died of poisoning and that the body should be released to his wife, Ms. Wang Ding, for burial. The diagnosis was attached to the file. After the autopsy, the family transported the body to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Fenglin Bridge, Xujiahui, for the encoffining.</p>
<h3>Wang Guangting Buys a Girl to Commit Indecency</h3>
<p>Xiao Mei Was Not Only Abducted but Also Nearly Lost Her Virginity</p>
<p>Xiao Mei, a thirteen-year-old girl who claims to be from Tuqiao Township, Wuhe County, Anhui Province, and whose father's name is Zhu Zhisheng, was abducted to Shanghai by a neighbor surnamed Chen between the 15th of last month. She was staying with a woman named Liu Yang at No. 164 Yutong Road, Zhabei. On the afternoon of the 27th, at a teahouse at No. 215 Zhoushan Road, she was sold to Wang Guangting (47 years old, from Shandong Province) at No. 45 Tangshan Road for ninety yuan to be his nephew's wife. Unexpectedly, the next night, Wang slept in the same bed with the girl. While she was asleep, he removed her trousers, intending to commit indecency. Before he could do so, the girl woke up and fled. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Zhang Youming of the Hongkou Police Station found the girl on the Bund of Nanjing Road. After learning the details, he arrested Wang Guangting and sent him to the First Special District Court. Wang confessed that a friend named Chen Debiao was one of the middlemen on the sales contract. He was ordered to be detained and the hearing was postponed. Detective Zhang learned that Chen (also known as Zongtian, from Suqian) and the fugitive Liu Yang were unknown, while Wang Guangtian insisted that he was also a middleman and that the money was paid to Liu Yang at the time. According to Xiao Mei, Chen was not present when the paper was written. Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed to summon witnesses for further verification.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Pudong: Gongda Warehouse Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Warehouse Losses Estimated at 100,000 Gold; Cause of Fire Still Unclear</p>
<p>The Gongda Warehouse at No. 88 Lujiazui Road, Pudong, consisted of three two-story buildings with thick walls and a large area. At 11:45 PM on the 9th, a fire suddenly broke out on the second floor. Due to the large number of matches stored, they quickly ignited, making it impossible to control the fire. At that time, two watchmen were returning from watching a fire in the Xiaoshiqiao area in the east when they caught sight of the fire in the warehouse. They rushed to open the door to extinguish the fire, but it was already ineffective, so they reported to various agencies for help. The Pudong District Fire Brigade immediately dispatched a large fire truck to the scene to extinguish the fire, followed by the Yangjing District Fire Brigade. As the flames broke through the top of the warehouse and the northeast wind was strong, the fire intensified. The Jianghai Customs also sent a fire boat to assist at the Lujiazui Pier. At that time, the onlookers were extremely crowded. The Pudong Branch Chief Zhang Mingqin supervised the police to maintain order, so that the firefighters could work calmly. After about half an hour, the floor of the warehouse collapsed, and the fire spread to a large amount of cattle bones stored downstairs. A foul smell spread, causing those who smelled it to cover their noses. The firefighters then concentrated their water power to spray the fire scene, but the fire did not diminish. It burned until about 3 AM the next morning, completely destroying the warehouse. The goods in the warehouse were also completely destroyed. The flames gradually weakened. The Zhonghe Warehouse, which was next to the west side of the warehouse, was in great danger, but fortunately, it was preserved with great effort. However, the embers of the Gongda Warehouse were not easily extinguished, and the firefighting work continued until midnight the day before yesterday, lasting more than twenty hours before it stopped. In addition to the warehouse, a total of 979 boxes of matches of various brands stored by the Dachina Match Company, 273 boxes of matches of various brands stored by the Minsheng Match Factory, 900 bags of cow bones from the Iwai Yoko, a large amount of miscellaneous grains from the Dingtai Zhenggda, 2,400 new burlap bags, and pharmaceuticals and sundries from Dachina were burned. The total loss of the warehouse and goods is estimated at 100,000 gold. Afterwards, the Pudong Branch Bureau summoned the warehouse manager Lin Xiaofang to the bureau for questioning. According to Lin, the warehouse was rented from the Baolai Sealand Grocery Store on the French Concession Bund for a monthly rent of 270 yuan and had been in business for twelve or thirteen years. The warehouse was usually locked tightly at night, and the watchmen stayed in a small house behind the warehouse. As for the cause of the fire, it may have been caused by rats gnawing on the paste on the new pile of matchboxes, causing the match heads to vibrate and ignite. It is said that the warehouse and goods were insured for a large sum, amounting to 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>In the Case of the Headless Body in a Trunk: Bloodstains Found on the Bed Board and Belt; No Bloodstains Found on the Straw and Ax; The Case Is Confusing and Elusive—The Interrogation Will Continue on the Afternoon of the 15th—</h3>
<p>The headless body in a trunk case, which has caused a sensation in society, has been cracked by Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Station. Fireman Mao A’gen, Jiang Yuanyan, and hostess Lin Gendi have been arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for repeated trials. However, Mao and others have sometimes confessed and sometimes completely denied the crime. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether there is a Wu Caiying living at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, Rue Paul Beau, and whether the murdered Caiying was a hostess at the Daxin Amusement Park. This has made the case confusing and elusive. The court has now scheduled a continuation of the hearing for the afternoon of the 15th of this month. In order to clarify the case, the judge in charge of the case, Zhong Xiao, has specially sent a bed board, a belt, a bundle of straw, and an ax used by Mao and Jiang, which were seized by the police in Cunfu Lane, to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination to determine whether there are any bloodstains. It is now learned that the institute has completed the examination and submitted a report to the court. The conclusion is roughly that bloodstains were found on the bed board and belt, but no bloodstains were found on the straw and ax.</p>
<h3>Rabbit Wool Spinning: Successful Experiment</h3>
<p>Minsheng Farm Begins Manufacturing; Zhang Ruizhi Says It Can Stem the Outflow of Funds</p>
<p>Raising rabbits is a new rural sideline industry, divided into three types: raising for meat, raising for skin, and raising for wool. The wool-raising type is the Angora rabbit. Its wool is very long and as fine as silk. The length of the wool is about four or five inches. This rabbit wool is the best raw material for spinning and weaving. It is also the raw material for the rabbit wool hats sold on the market. If Angora rabbit wool is spun into yarn and woven into clothing, it will be extremely light, soft, and warm, making it suitable for those who are sensitive to cold. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Minsheng Farm at No. 534 Xiangyin Road in this city has manufactured two types of hand-operated wool spinning wheels for rabbit raisers to spin the sheared rabbit wool into yarn for sale. After successful experimentation, more spinning wheels will be manufactured to distribute the rabbit wool produced by the farm to the villagers of Dachang Township to spin into yarn, which will then be made into vests and other clothing for sale. According to Zhang Ruizhi, the head of the farm, if the people of our country universally raise wool-producing Angora rabbits, a large amount of the outflow of funds for imported wool textiles can be recovered each year.</p>
<h3>Meilong Town: Plum Blossoms Bloom Twice</h3>
<p>The former Meijialong Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, now renamed Meilong Station, had a plum tree planted in the open space between the stationmaster's apartment and the trackside dormitory during the era when the Shanghai-Zhejiang Railway was commercially operated. Over the years, it has grown to be about ten feet tall. It blooms and bears fruit every February in the lunar calendar. This year, it bloomed and bore fruit once in March of the Gregorian calendar. On the recent National Day, plum blossoms suddenly bloomed again, with an unusually lush and bright pink color, more vibrant than in the spring. People came from far and wide to visit, and all praised the miracle.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Red Army Leader Hong Xingxiang Arrested on the Border of Jiangxi and Anhui; Once Led Bandits to Ravage His Hometown of Wuyuan; Arrested on Huining Road While Out on National Day</h3>
<p>Hong Kairong, a native of Wuyuan who is currently studying at the Zhengfeng College of Literature on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, learned when he returned to his hometown this autumn that the houses in his hometown had been almost completely burned down by bandits, and the people were displaced, a pitiful sight. He then learned that the bandit leaders had fled to Shanghai, including Hong Xingxiang, who was also from Wuyuan. He had once led the bandits to ravage his hometown and had also fled to Shanghai with the bandits, hiding in the Nanshi area. On the recent National Day, Hong Kairong took a break from school. At about 10 AM, he was walking on Huining Road when he met the bandit Hong Xingxiang. He immediately reported to Dong Yudu, the police officer of the jurisdiction, who immediately arrested the bandit and took him to the Ximen Branch Bureau. After a brief interrogation, the defendant admitted that he had participated in the pseudo-Red Army on the border of Jiangxi and Anhui and had been responsible for certain tasks. He then submitted a confession for review. The bureau, considering the seriousness of the case, ordered that a formal report be sent to the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department for investigation.</p>
<h3>Qionghua Flowers in Full Bloom at Xiangsheng Company Last Night</h3>
<p>Over Three Hundred People Visited to View, All Praising in Admiration</p>
<p>Xiangsheng Company on Beijing Road in this city has a pot of qionghua flowers with lush branches and leaves. Recently, several buds suddenly sprouted. One flower bloomed the night before last, but it was only noticed after it had withered, so no one saw the flower in full bloom. Just as everyone was regretting it, six flowers suddenly bloomed together last night at about 8 PM. This reporter rushed to see them. They were in full bloom, with a shape like a white lotus, but more delicate and beautiful. Each one grew on the tip of a sword-shaped leaf, drooping gracefully and slightly upward, facing the electric light like a sunflower facing the sun. It was truly a beautiful sight. Qionghua flowers usually bloom at night and last for only four or five hours. After this reporter took pictures to commemorate the occasion, the outer petals gradually began to wither. It is expected that after this reporter left, they would surely wither and fade away. Some said that this was like the fleeting beauty of the epiphyllum. Over three hundred people came to see the flowers last night after hearing the news, all praising in admiration and congratulating Zhou Xiangsheng, the owner of the company.</p>
<h3>The Life Story of Kang Wenjuan, the Woman Who Drowned Herself</h3>
<p>Kang Wenjuan, a woman from Dinghai, boarded the Xinning Shao ferry from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 7th and drowned herself at sea that night. She sacrificed herself for the sake of her country, and all who heard of it mourned her. It is now learned that Ms. Kang is the daughter of Kang Songxiu, an employee of the Dispatching Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Kang Jun settled in Zhabei due to his job. Ms. Kang served her parents. She was reasonable and knowledgeable and cared about national affairs. During the January 28th Incident, her home was destroyed by fire. After the incident, she still lived in Zhabei. Recently, the situation in Shanghai became tense. Ms. Kang was saddened by the impending national crisis and feared that the turbulent situation would endanger the lives of her parents and that she would be unable to protect her own chastity, so she chose to end her life. Her ambition is commendable, and her fate is pitiful.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Rectifies Lawyers' Conduct</h3>
<p>Bans Illegal Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association and the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate have discussed cooperating in rectifying lawyers' conduct. The Standing Committee member Chen Tingrui and Chief Prosecutor Zhu have agreed on five points for cooperation: (1) Lawyers must sign and seal their names at the end of the petitions they draft. (2) Agencies that handle documents and litigation tricksters will be banned. (3) Lawyers are only allowed to establish one law firm. (4) Lawyers should conduct litigation in accordance with the law. Before a case is judged, they are not allowed to publish notices in newspapers to wanted defendants on behalf of their clients. (5) In criminal proceedings, there are only procedures for prosecution, appeal, and retrial, and there are no procedures for filing a case. Lawyers may not abuse the process of requesting the filing of a case. The above measures have been resolved and passed by the association. In addition to copying the instructions of the Ministry of Judicial Administration to all members for compliance, the Executive Committee has investigated and found that a certain agency handling legal documents is an illegal organization and has requested the court to strictly ban it.</p>
<h3>Shen Liuqi Sentenced for Using Counterfeit Money</h3>

The case was discovered, and he was arrested by Chinese Detective Shan Huihai of the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. The case was continued by Judge Zhong Qing of the Third Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that no other cases had been found during the postponement and requested a severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant stammered in his confession and asked for leniency. Judge Zhong sentenced Shen Liuqi to one year and six months in prison as a warning. The five counterfeit banknotes were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Discuss Shanghai Factories Participating in the National Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Autumn National Products Exhibition, organized by the Nanjing National Products Exhibition Hall, is scheduled to open on November 10. A temporary National Products Market will also be set up to welcome manufacturers from this city to participate. The hall has sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss the matter. The following is a copy of the reply from the hall to the Shanghai Federation of Chinese National Products Manufacturers in this city: "In response to your association's official letter of September 30, we have received your hall's official letter No. 164 of September 10, stating that the Autumn National Products Exhibition is still awaiting approval and that preparations will be made as soon as approval is granted, and that our association will be formally invited to participate actively. Now, we have read the Nanjing News column of the September 27 Central Daily News, which states that your hall will hold an Autumn National Products Exhibition during the National Congress, with a magnificent scale. Is this true? We are writing to inquire again. If it is true, we hope that you will reply as soon as possible so that we can prepare early. The members of our association account for seven-tenths of all national products factories in Shanghai. At that time, we will lead our members to Beijing to participate and jointly support the grand event, and we also request permission to be the exclusive agent for collecting items from Shanghai and to unify the powers, etc." In response, we have found that the National Products Exhibition of our hall in the 25th year of the Republic is now scheduled to open on November 10, and a temporary National Products Market will also be held at the same time to welcome national products manufacturers to participate in selling goods. Our hall welcomes your association to lead its members to Beijing to participate. A formal letter of solicitation has already been sent separately, and personnel will be sent to Shanghai in the coming days to discuss the matter in person. Accordingly, we reply in a letter and hope that you will check and handle the matter accordingly." After receiving the letter from the Shanghai Federation of Chinese National Products Manufacturers, the chairman of the association, Mr. Lin Kanghou, decided to convene a meeting of manufacturers in the coming days to discuss participation measures.</p>

<h3>Passionate Affair Turns Tragic: Young Couple Attempts Suicide with Opium</h3>
<p>Shen Jinzhu Dies, Wang Chengjin Rescued and Arrested</p>
<p>Wang Chengjin, a 26-year-old local laundry worker in the New Life Apartment in Hengmao Lane in the French Concession, recently met Shen Jinzhu, an 18-year-old girl from Suzhou. They lived together like a married couple, renting a room on the upper floor of No. 5 Gong'an Lane on Avenue Doumer. Unexpectedly, Shen Jinzhu had already been betrothed in her hometown. Last spring, she was introduced to Shanghai to work as a servant. Her fiancé's family had set the wedding date for the third day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar. Her mother, realizing the wedding was approaching, came to Shanghai yesterday to urge her daughter to return. Who knew that the girl was passionately in love and unwilling to separate from her lover, leading to discord. Yesterday afternoon, she secretly consumed a large amount of opium to kill herself. Soon after, she went alone to Wang's place and told him everything. Wang then searched her pocket and found two opium pellets remaining, which he snatched and swallowed. Thus, the tragic case of double suicide occurred. Shortly after, the poison took effect and became uncontrollable. They were sent together to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but the girl died around 6 PM due to excessive opium consumption. Wang was given injections and stomach pumping by the doctor and recovered. The hospital reported to the Lujiawan General Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Wang and bring him to the police station for questioning.</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony Held</p>
<p>After the presidium of the meeting, Wang Zhenhuan, Ye Shichang, Pan Jishan, Peng Guangnian, Wu Juenong, Dai Shiyuan, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Wu Huanru), Guo Bingwen (represented by Wang Shi　), Cai Wuji (represented by Wu Juenong) performed the rituals, Ma Keqiang, representative of the Ministry of Industry, Wu Huanru, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Ke Zhongzheng, representative of the Fujian Construction Department, Shen Guangxi, representative of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Wang Shi　, representative of the International Trade Bureau, Wu Juenong, representative of the Commodity Inspection Bureau and Anhui Construction Department, successively delivered speeches.

Wang Zhenhuan reported on the organization of the association and the purpose of the meeting. The event ended happily around 1 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Zhenhuan said in his speech, "Today is the first annual meeting of the China Tea Association. Gentlemen from all walks of life have come to attend. I, on behalf of the association, welcome you and express my sincere gratitude. In particular, important institutions such as the Ministry of Industry, the Agricultural Bank, the International Trade Bureau, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the provincial governments, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Social Affairs Bureau all have representatives present to provide guidance. The future of this association will certainly be great. Although today's meeting is an ordinary annual meeting, the entire Chinese tea industry, whether in production, manufacturing, or sales, needs a reform. However, this kind of reform cannot be accomplished by the power of a few people. The first hope of this association is that all those who work in the Chinese tea industry (regardless of which aspect, all those related to tea) participate in the association, unite, and exchange opinions at any time, so that this association has the qualification to speak on behalf of the Chinese tea industry and raise the status of Chinese tea. The second hope is that the gentlemen from the government will give this association practical guidance and support. All administrative plans for improving and revitalizing tea that the government undertakes in the future should fully incorporate the opinions of this association, because the opinions of this association can be said to be the true essence of the tea industry. The next hope is that guests from all walks of life can provide guidance and assistance to this association based on their own positions and abilities, so that the association's affairs can develop, which is what all members of the association hope for."</p>
<p>Instructional Speech from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Ma Keqiang, Section Chief of the Ministry of Industry, said in his instructional speech, "The silk and tea industries occupy an important position in my country's international trade. In recent years, due to the decline in exports, the trade deficit has increased, which has a great impact on the entire national economy. In the past, the organization was scattered, and those engaged in the tea business planned for their own personal interests, without regard to the development of the entire industry, which will lose its position in international trade. Examining its shortcomings, it lies in the backwardness of technology. The Ministry of Industry has begun to study and improve production and strictly implement inspections to improve quality. As for sales methods, they should also be improved at the same time. In short, the government takes the overall interest as a premise, and certainly does not represent the interests of one class or one part. It is hoped that tea merchants across the country will contribute opinions so that they can understand the situation in all aspects, determine fundamental measures, and jointly seek development. I also represent the Ministry of Industry in wishing the association success."</p>
<p>Recorded Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Wang Shi　, representative of the International Trade Bureau, said in his speech, "My country is actively engaged in economic construction this year. To develop the entire economy, each industry must be improved, otherwise it will be in the idle world trend. Externally, it is not enough to resist the oppression of international competition, and internally, it is not enough to seek the development of various undertakings. Your association has gathered seniors from all over the country who are engaged in the tea industry, and the organization is sound, and it will be able to produce great results." (2) Wu Juenong, representative of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, said in his speech, "I hope that your association will unite to resist foreign insults. The decline of my country's tea industry lies in the layers of exploitation by tea farmers, tea merchants, and tea shops, and the lack of improvement in technology, but the pressure of foreign tea competition is a greater reason." Subsequently, Wu Huanru, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and others gave speeches. The length of the speeches is omitted.</p>
<p>First General Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the first general meeting was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. More than 170 members attended. Tang Jishan was publicly elected as chairman.

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Order</h3>
<p>Hongzhang Factory Resumes Work</p>
<p>The Factory Side Resists the Government Order</p>
<p>Workers Schedule Petition</p>
<p>Dagon News states: The Hongzhang Textile and Dyeing Factory at No. 381 Maignan Road in this city employs more than 1,000 male and female workers. After the factory learned of the workers organizing a union, on September 28, it dismissed worker representatives He Gen　 and Xu Wenxue, causing dissatisfaction among all the workers and resulting in a work stoppage. After persuasion, they resumed work first. Unexpectedly, the factory again dismissed five representatives who were enthusiastic about the labor movement: Zhang Shunlai, Ni Rumu, Wang Afang, Ni Jingou, and Chen Linhai, causing another labor strike that has not been resolved. After the workers presented a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau, they received reply No. 201, which read: "Received. Upon investigation, if disputes occur between labor and management, and work is stopped or strikes occur without mediation or arbitration procedures, this bureau has repeatedly 　prohibited them. Now, the workers of the factory have 　stopped working due to the dismissal of two union organizers, which is inappropriate. In addition to the investigation and handling of the dismissal of He Gen 　cai and Xu Wenxue, the rest of the workers should immediately resume work in accordance with the 　order and not delay." After the workers received the order, they went to work at the factory around 6 AM the day before yesterday. For three consecutive days, they were rejected. Around 6 PM in the afternoon, the factory reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent a large number of detectives to the factory to suppress them. Fortunately, the workers strictly maintained order and no incidents occurred. The police chief instructed the workers to temporarily withdraw and wait for the investigation of the truth before further debate. The workers decided to petition on Monday, requesting relief, because the factory refused the government order.</p>
<h3>Buyer of Great Northern Telegraph Company</h3>
<p>Wang Tianyu's Divorce is Different</p>
<p>Wang Tian　, a native of Ningbo and the Chinese buyer of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, is 31 years old. Nine years ago, he married Liu Lijuan, a woman from Suzhou, through a matchmaker. They lived together at No. 55 Garden Square, Rue Cardinal Fesch in the French Concession. Since their marriage, their relationship has been fairly harmonious. They have a son named Ziyun, who is eight years old. Recently, the two sides suddenly disagreed and went to extremes. Liu Lijuan believed that it would be difficult to grow old together in the long run, so she proposed a divorce. On September 8 of this year, they signed an agreement to terminate their marital relationship at the Huang Xiuxian Law Firm. According to the lawyers of both parties, Wang Tian　 paid Liu 　currency 500 yuan at a time. However, after signing the agreement, Liu Lijuan suddenly declared that the mere 500 yuan was not enough to maintain her livelihood for the rest of her life, so she published a statement opposing the previously signed contract. She also hired a lawyer to request the First Special Court's Civil Court to summon Wang Tian　 to the case for mediation and increase the living expenses by 500 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the 　judge opened the Civil 　court and summoned Wang Tian　 to the case. After mediation, Wang Tian　 agreed to pay another 480 yuan in living expenses to avoid future troubles, and Liu Lijuan also expressed her consent. The two parties signed a settlement record in court. From then on, they went their separate ways.</p>
<h3>Pan Asan Stabbed</h3>
<p>Pan Asan, a 51-year-old man from Ningbo, runs the Deyuan Straw Paper Shop at No. 23 Chongqing Road in the British Concession. At around 9 PM the night before last, a man suddenly broke into the shop with a sharp knife and stabbed Pan Asan six times, one each in the head and neck, two in the left leg, and two in the back. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled. Hua Pu No. 967 drove the injured person to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was quite serious, with excessive bleeding, and there was a risk to his life.</p>
<h3>Funing Company Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>Extending the Deadline for Reporting Claims</p>
<p>The Funing　Co., Ltd., founded by Fujianese, previously entrusted lawyer Sun Zhongyao to clear up accounts due to financial difficulties. Later, due to disagreements with shareholders, the company filed a petition with the Special 　Court for bankruptcy. The court approved it and appointed accountant Xu Yong　 as the company's bankruptcy property manager. It also notified creditors to report their claims to the accountant and scheduled a creditors' meeting. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that there are still unreported claims for all the company's debts. Therefore, accountant Xu petitioned the Special Second Court to allow an extension of the claim reporting period, and the court approved it. The claim reporting period was extended to October 30, and creditors were notified on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Found Murdered on Yanping Road</h3>
<p>A man, about thirty years old, who had been hacked to death was suddenly found in front of No. 27　, near Jiaozhou Road and Yanping Road, at around 10 PM last night. After reporting to the 　police for investigation, it was discovered that the abdomen had been fatally slashed. He was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital and, after examination, transferred to the autopsy room. A detective was dispatched to investigate clues and pursue the murderer.</p>
<h3>Little Sisters is Full Every Day</h3>
<p>Since Yihua Company's latest talking blockbuster "Little Sisters" was released simultaneously in the two major theaters, Carlton and New Light, on the 8th, the three shows day and night have been full in both theaters. Those who arrive later have all been disappointed. Therefore, both theaters start selling tickets at 10 AM every day, 　to answer the enthusiasm of the ladies who love to watch "Little Sisters".</p>
<h3>Wang and Mei Wedding</h3>
<p>The wedding of the philosopher Wang Jueming's son 　and Miss 　Yunqing was held at the Daguanlou on Fuzhou Road on Double Ten Day. Philanthropist 　Lanting officiated the wedding. Abandoning extravagance and advocating frugality, 　it is called a model wedding in the New Life 　movement.</p>
<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>Renfeng Textile and Dyeing Factory Outlet's Big Sale 　The Renfeng Textile and Dyeing Factory in this city has branches on Limalu Street, Ximen, Zhonghua Road, and Huangjia Que Road in Nanshi, and on Avenue de la Consulat and Rue du Moulin in the French Concession. It produces all kinds of cloth, new feather silk Ning silk, imitation Western satin 　colored cloth seasonal clothing materials, and also participates in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce National Products Exhibition next to the International Hotel on Nanjing Road. It will sell the products at sacrificial prices to show its utmost intention to promote domestic cloth.</p>
<p>Jingyi's New No-Scru Frames Arrive 　The Jingyi Optical Company on Nanjing Road in this city has newly shipped from the United States a machine for assembling rimless glasses with electric heat. The most popular white gold rimless glasses on the market are quite popular, because they are light, 　elegant, and clean. However, the connection between the lens and the temples and the nose bridge was originally fastened with small screws. If they are too tight, they are easy to break, and if they are 　loose, they are skewed and shaky, or there may be defects such as falling nails, which is a shortcoming. The company has learned from this that all rimless glasses are fastened without old-fashioned silk screws, using the No-Scru electric heating method, which is strong and beautiful and will not loosen, which is a new contribution to the eyewear industry.</p>
<p>Reliable Radio Repair Shop 　The broadcasting business is becoming more and more developed, and the demand for radios is increasing. However, the biggest difficulty for users is the beauty problem after the radio is damaged. The establishment of radio repair shops in Shanghai is as numerous as bamboo shoots after a rain, so it is very difficult for users to choose a repair shop. The Yadah Company at No. 88 Nanjing Road in this city pioneered the Radio Repair Department, which has been in operation for five years. The person in charge has sincere service and business ethics, and always takes the interests and satisfaction of users as the premise. There is no deception, no tricks, strict management, and accurate work. The achievements are remarkable and it has become the only good repair department on the sea. All users who have suffered from deception and damage can know what to choose.</p>

<h3>Huanlong Road: A Young Man Was Shot Dead Last Night; The Location Was a Bungalow in Qianjiatang, Wujia Lane; He Was Shot Three Times and Immediately Fell to the Ground and Died Instantly.</h3>
<p>At 11:35 last night, in a bungalow at No. 168, Wujia Lane, Qianjiatang, Huanlong Road, French Concession, a young man was suddenly shot and killed by thugs. This reporter rushed to the scene to investigate upon hearing the news. According to residents there, the house at No. 168 is inhabited by an old local widow, with no one else in the house. At around 11:30, the widow was playing mahjong with several people when suddenly a young man, about thirty years old, wearing a white cloth short shirt, black cloth pants, a black long gown, black socks, black shoes, and a copper basin-style felt hat, rushed in from the west into the guest hall. Behind the young man, two thugs were chasing him. When they reached the door, the thugs fired three shots at the young man, all hitting vital points such as the head and chest. He fell to the ground and died instantly. The thugs took the opportunity to escape. Nearby patrol officers, hearing the shots, rushed to the scene and reported to the police station. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They took the widow from the house to the police station for questioning. They also found a letter beside the deceased, postmarked from Anhui to Shanghai. It is still difficult to determine whether the name on the letter is the real name of the deceased. After the detectives finished their investigation, they immediately notified the Tongren Fuyuan Branch to send staff to carry the body to the morgue for examination.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address to the Boy Scouts: Consolidate Unity and Revitalize the Nation</h3>
<p>(1) Today's unity is the most important foundation for us to build the nation, recover sovereignty, and revitalize the nation. (2) Today's unity is the crystallization of the countless sweat and blood of our 400 million compatriots and must be especially cherished and forever consolidated. (3) This Boy Scout rally and inspection shows the obedience to orders, strict discipline, and support for the government of the youth of the whole country. (4) It is hoped that the people of the whole country will practice the "Party Member Code," restore inherent morality, unite sincerely, and strive for revitalization.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th) Chairman Chiang gave an address at the National Boy Scout Rally and Inspection Ceremony on the 10th, titled "Consolidate Unity and Revitalize the Nation." The text is as follows: Dear Boy Scouts of the whole country, today is the Double Tenth Festival of the 25th year of the Republic of China, which is the most glorious and greatest National Day memorial day for our Premier and the general martyrs to overthrow the Manchu Qing autocracy and create the Republic of China through arduous struggles. Twenty-five years ago, thanks to the belief in the Three Principles of the People and the support of the Chinese Kuomintang by the compatriots of the whole country, that is, your fathers, brothers, teachers and elders, the Republic of China was created in the hands of the Premier. It has been twenty-five years now, and the country has gone through many difficulties, because the people of the whole country, especially you, the dear young boy scouts, are able to believe in the Three Principles of the People, support the National Government, obey the orders of the country, and abide by revolutionary discipline, so that the national unification of today has been thoroughly realized. Everyone must understand why we were regarded as not being a country and were subjected to all kinds of contempt in the past, and why our Three Principles of the People have not yet been fully realized, and our compatriots have not yet been saved until now, is because our country is not unified. Without unity, there is no strength, and without strength, one will be despised. Therefore, if we want to save the country, revitalize the nation, and recover sovereignty, and seek freedom and equality for China, we must first unify the entire Republic of China, and make the 400 million compatriots of the whole country unite forever and firmly. Today, the boy scouts of the whole country have come to the capital from all provinces, not afraid of traveling, to participate in the national boy scout jamboree and grand review. The whole body can obey orders, abide by discipline, and everything is neat and orderly. This shows that the youth of the whole country can unite in one mind to support the National Government, obey the orders of the country, and be able to lovingly and sincerely unite to shoulder the mission of revitalizing the nation. This President is the commander-in-chief of the boy scouts of the whole country, and today I especially want to solemnly tell everyone your status and responsibilities. Your status is the most noble citizens of the Republic of China. Your current responsibility is to save the country, recover sovereignty, and revitalize the nation. Not only do you have to recognize this responsibility yourselves, but you must also tell your fathers, brothers, teachers, elders, and general relatives and friends when you return to various places, schools, and homes. Now our country has been unified. After unification, we must immediately strive to save the country and revitalize the nation. How can we save the country and revitalize the nation? It is necessary for all men and women, old and young, throughout the country to unanimously support the government, obey orders, share weal and woe, and live and die together. Now that the country has been unified in its entirety, this unified situation is the most important foundation for us to build the country, recover sovereignty, and revitalize the nation in the future. From now on, the compatriots of the whole country must know that this foundation for saving the country and revitalization is the crystallization of the countless sweat and blood of our 400 million compatriots before and after us. We cannot but cherish and love it exceptionally, and strive to consolidate it forever. How can we forever consolidate the foundation of unity and achieve the goal of revitalizing the nation? It is necessary to fundamentally restore the inherent spirit and morality of our Chinese nation. In the past, because most people forgot the inherent spirit and morality of the nation, everyone could not unite in one mind, and the country could not be unified and stable. From now on, we must forever consolidate unity and further achieve the goal of revitalizing the nation. First of all, we must restore and transform the inherent spirit of our nation and the inherent morality of our ancestors, that is, the eight virtues of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace" spoken by the Premier, with one heart and one mind. If the country can do this, I believe that our nation will certainly be able to be revitalized, and our country can gain freedom and equality. Moreover, in the future, our nation can always be the first-class nation in the world, and our country can also always be the first-class country. Just now I said that we must restore the inherent spirit of our nation and the inherent morality of our ancestors. How exactly should we strive to achieve this? It is necessary for everyone to personally practice the "Twelve Rules for Party Members" passed by the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang last year. These twelve rules are named "Rules for Party Members." In fact, they were originally "Rules for Boy Scouts," and were personally formulated by this President during battlefield operations. Today, the boy scouts have come to Beijing from afar. This President does not have good gifts to give to everyone, so I will personally授授these twelve rules. Now this President will first recite the "Twelve Rules for Party Members" once, and then everyone will recite each rule aloud in turn. (1) Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism; (2) Filial piety is the foundation of governing the family; (3) Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with things; (4) Trustworthiness and righteousness are the foundation of establishing a career; (5) Peace is the foundation of dealing with the world; (6) Courtesy is the foundation of managing affairs; (7) Obedience is the foundation of taking responsibility; (8) Diligence and thrift are the foundation of service; (9) Cleanliness is the foundation of strengthening the body; (10) Helping others is the foundation of happiness; (11) Learning is the foundation of helping the world; (12) Perseverance is the foundation of success. Everyone should pay attention to these twelve rules, which are the most important weapons for us to build the country, recover sovereignty, and revitalize the nation in the future. As long as we can all practice these twelve rules, the lost sovereignty can certainly be recovered, and the dying nation can certainly be revitalized. Therefore, we are not afraid that sovereignty cannot be recovered or that the nation cannot be revitalized, but only that everyone cannot practice the "Twelve Rules for Party Members." From now on, everyone should not only respectfully follow these twelve rules themselves, but also bring them back to various places, schools, and homes, and tell your parents, teachers, and all relatives and friends, so that everyone can awaken together and restore the inherent spirit of our nation and the inherent morality of our ancestors, and carry them forward. Only in this way can we forever consolidate the foundation of unity, complete the great cause of revitalization as soon as possible, and fulfill the responsibility of our boy scouts. I hope that everyone will come here from afar, gather in one place for a grand jamboree and review, and take this opportunity to learn from each other, seek progress together, strictly abide by discipline, unite in spirit, and at the same time, everyone should pay special attention to hygiene, strengthen their bodies, and be sure to prepare a strong physique for serving the country and revitalizing the nation.</p>

<h3>National Boy Scout Inspection Ceremony on National Day; Chairman Chiang Presides Over the Inspection of Boy Scouts; Delivers an Address Clarifying the Responsibilities of Boy Scouts; Closing Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning, Followed by the Evacuation of All Camps</h3>
<p>The grand second national Boy Scout inspection, which has caused a sensation throughout the country, was held at 8:00 am this morning (10th), amidst the cheers of the crowd celebrating National Day, at the solemn Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen Central Sports Ground. At the same time, the National Day commemoration was held, chaired by Chairman Chiang, who also served as the chief inspector, and Liu Yongyao served as the commander-in-chief. Members of the Central Committee and officials from various departments and committees, as well as Madame Chiang, all participated in the grand event. The participating units from various provinces and cities included boy scouts from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Nanjing, Shanghai, Anhui, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Shanxi, Shandong, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangxi, Hebei, Suiyuan, Chahar, Gansu, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Jiangning Experimental County, Liaoning, Jilin, Rehe, and Heilongjiang, totaling 31 provinces, cities, and counties, with a total of 11,000 people. More than 100,000 guests were in the stands around the venue. The campsites were open in the morning and afternoon, and ladies visited from morning to evening, shoulder to shoulder, in an endless stream, totaling hundreds of thousands of people. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, curriculum performances were held separately at the Central Sports Ground, the football field, and the National Sports College playground. From 7:30 pm to 9:00 pm, a lantern parade was held after gathering at the Lizhi Society. From 8:00 am to 9:00 am on the 11th, a memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death was held, followed by the closing ceremony, and then the evacuation of the camps began. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Officials</p>

<p>Grand Inspection</p>
<p>At 7:00 am, the boy scouts from various provinces and cities formed a team and entered the inspection field one after another from the campsite, standing in the designated area to await inspection. At 8:00 am, the emcee announced the start of the National Day memorial ceremony, and the flag was raised. All unit and regimental flags were tilted 45 degrees to salute. At the same time, all boy scouts performed the salute with staffs. After paying tribute to the Party and national flags and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait as usual, all boy scouts saluted Chairman Chiang and Vice Chairmen Dai and He. Then the inspection ceremony began. First, the commanders of each district reported the number of boy scouts participating in their respective districts to the commander-in-chief. Then, the commander-in-chief reported the total number of boy scouts participating from various provinces and cities to the chief inspector. The chief inspector then accompanied the inspectors and set off from each end of the podium, circling the field for a week, inspecting each regiment in detail. When the chief inspector arrived in each district, the commander of that district issued the command "Salute." At the same time, the unit flag and regimental flag of that district were tilted 45 degrees, and the chief and deputy leaders and regimental commanders performed the hand-salute. The boy scouts performed the staff-salute (watching with their eyes, only saluting the chief inspector). After the chief inspector passed by, ten steps after that district, the commander of that district issued the command "Salute Complete." The unit and regimental flags returned to their original positions, and the chief and deputy leaders, regimental commanders, and boy scouts returned to attention. After the inspection, the parade began. The leader was the nine Chinese boy scouts who went to the United States. Then, under the command of the commander-in-chief, the boy scouts from various provinces and cities followed, with the Jiangsu boy scouts at the head and the Heilongjiang boy scouts at the end. During the march, the military band of the teaching corps played music. The boy scouts were full of spirit, marched in neat steps, and their movements were agile. The viewers praised them without ceasing. When the boy scouts of each unit marched to the first flag of the inspection platform in the south, the regimental commander issued the command "March in step." When they marched to the second flag of the inspection platform in the south, the regimental commander issued the command "Eyes right." When they marched to the third flag of the inspection platform in the north, the regimental commander issued the command "Eyes front." When they marched to the fourth flag of the inspection platform in the north, the regimental commander issued the command "March at ease." They marched to the front of the inspection platform to listen to the general inspection and address. After the address, they sang the Boy Scout song and shouted slogans before leaving the field in formation and returning to camp.</p>
<p>慰劳边省</p>
<p>Comforting the Border Provinces</p>
<p>The boy scouts from various border provinces and cities participating in this grand inspection did not hesitate to travel, did not avoid hardship, and rushed to Beijing day and night, which is admirable. When the march was held, the boy scouts from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Rehe, Chahar, Hebei, Suiyuan, Beiping, Tianjin, Gansu, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces and cities passed by the grandstands. The people in the stands applauded to show their welcome. The crowds of boy scouts in Liaojihei, Recha, except for applauding welcome, and take the initiative to stand up and pay tribute, express the sentiment of慰劳.</p>
<p>Airplane Performance</p>
<p>During the meeting, several airplanes circled in the sky, sometimes up and down, sometimes upside down or俯翻斗, circling the garden, speeding slowly, flying sideways and obliquely, with various patterns, more than can be numbered. The audience in the stands clapped and cheered, and the sound was thunderous. Then several planes flew in formation, arranged into a double twelfth character, expressing the meaning of celebrating National Day, and the audience cheered even more. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, the boy scouts from various provinces and cities held curriculum performances in separate areas at the Central Sports Ground, the National Martial Arts Ground, and the National Sports College playground. The performances of each unit were very exciting.</p>
<p>擁護領袖</p>
<p>Support the Leader</p>
<p>Our national revolutionary leader, Chiang Kai-shek, who has worked hard and made great contributions, served as the chairman of the Tenth Congress and the chief inspector. The committee members wore the glittering land-style special-class general's formal dress, wearing medals, with a broad sash, looking very powerful, walking very healthy, and in excellent spirits. Whenever they went to a place, the audience in the stands would automatically stand up and salute, and so would the speech. At the wonderful place, the people in the whole audience applauded unanimously, and the sound shook the sky, which showed the people's sincere support for the revolutionary leader and the love for the revolutionary leader.</p>

<h3>The Closing Ceremony Was Held Yesterday Morning, and a Memorial Service for the Death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen Was Held</h3>
<p>戴王兩氏致詞(Speeches by Dai and Wang)</p>
<p>(Nanjing, __th) The Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree, at 8:00 am on the 11th, held the 40th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death in London and the closing ceremony at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Vice Chairman Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin, Director Wang Shijie, Committee Member Gui Yongqing, Xu Guanyu, and representatives of various agencies, all boy scouts, and service personnel, totaling more than 13,000 people, attended. After Chairman Dai led the ceremony, he reported on the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in London and the group's description of the environment in China after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's initial failure and the revolutionary forces at that time. The thoughts of the Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree were developed in great detail. Director Wang Shijie reported on the Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree and the hopes for the Boy Scouts in the future. At 9:00 am, the ceremony was completed. All boy scouts returned to the camp, sorted out their camping equipment and luggage, and began to evacuate the camp at 9:00 am. It is expected that it will all be completed by the afternoon of the 13th.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Works Exhibition; More Than 10,000 Exhibits; Enthusiastic Visitors</h3>
<p>The Boy Scout Works Exhibition, organized by the Propaganda Group of the National Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree, was hosted by Yang Ruihong, the head of the exhibition department. The location was the Revolutionary Memorial Hall of Linggu Temple. After two weeks of planning and arrangement, it was officially opened on the 8th. There were a total of 15,000 exhibits from various provinces and cities. Except for a part of children's toys, the rest were various models with national defense awareness, such as airplanes, cannons, bombs, tanks, warships, charts, etc., totaling no less than eight or nine thousand pieces. The department was divided into three rooms upstairs and downstairs for display. The first room was on the right side downstairs, and all were national defense equipment. The second room was upstairs, and the exhibits were divided into four parts: (1) model specimens, (2) weaving and embroidery carvings, (3) handicraft chemicals, and (4) literature souvenirs. The third room was on the left side downstairs, and all were charts and photos. The corridors around were rope knots and campsite models. The rest were a part of Boy Scout books published by the Zhonghua Book Company and the 225 Qi Dian for visitors to refer to. According to Yang Ruihong, the host, "Since the opening of this exhibition, the boy scouts from various provinces and cities and people from the community have been very enthusiastic about visiting. Since Boy Scout education has been designated as a compulsory course by the Ministry of Education, it has attracted the attention of the general public, and the boy scouts themselves have not returned due to the training they have received. Most of them should create ideas. Therefore, all the works related to national defense make the visitors unusually beautiful," Yunyun, also heard that the exhibition will be closed on the 14th, Yunyun.</p>
<h3>The Judging Committee Inspects the Camp; The Results Are Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The second Boy Scout Grand Review and Jamboree was held in Mu Dian Li yesterday morning, and the participating units from various provinces and cities will leave the camp after the closing ceremony and return to their hometowns. I learned that the General Association, in order to assess the results of the Boy Scouts in various places, specially organized a camping evaluation committee. The committee also convened the evaluators at the office at 7:00 pm on the 9th. The attendees included Duan Xipeng (Xu Guanyu on behalf), Wu Miaorui, Liu Daqian, Yan Jialin, Ye Suchong, Chen Yingmei (Zhou Yueying on behalf), Yuan Zongze, etc. Detailed regulations were made regarding the evaluation standards and scoring methods. The evaluation committee members began to inspect the camps of each unit separately from yesterday, the most important of which were the campsite building campsite design, cleanliness, hygiene, and other items. According to Wu Yunrui, Yan Jialin, and others, the design and construction of each unit have made considerable progress, such as using topography to create gardens with artistic meaning, such as using militarily used items to make all kinds of national defense models, etc., all of which are very ingenious and can inspire the nation's patriotic thoughts, but there are still a few units that use workers, and they only occupy the position of design leadership, which is a pity. In short, there is no big derivation to be found in the overall observation of this resolution. As for the results, the evaluators are now engaged in sorting out, and the meeting will be held to decide in a few days, Yunyun.</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Boy Scout Grand Review</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Boy Scout education places equal emphasis on "teaching," "learning," and "doing," and is a purposeful, principled, and powerful form of modern education. On the positive side, it cultivates children to serve society and become moral, cultivated, and capable youth. On the negative side, it prevents children from developing bad habits and avoids moral decay. In normal times, it implements the training of oaths, regulations, and skills. In extraordinary times, it can leverage its strengths to serve society and the nation. Therefore, Boy Scout education is indeed the foundational education for China's current efforts to cultivate talents, teach lessons, and revive the nation. In recent years, foreign invasions have been frequent, and our land has been fragmented. To complete the arduous mission of national rejuvenation, it is imperative to intensify the training of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts nationwide. This is currently the most important task. Of the 470 million people, the elderly have few days left, and the strong may be tainted by bad habits. The purest and most hopeful are the youth, and the youth will bear the greatest responsibility in the future. Therefore, this national Boy Scout Grand Review carries great significance. It is not just a grand review of outstanding youth from across the country, but no less than a general review of the nation's lifeline. I once read the purpose of the Boy Scouts of China, which states, "The Boy Scouts of China aim to develop children's ability to do things, cultivate good habits, enhance their personality, enrich their knowledge, strengthen their bodies, and become youth equipped with wisdom, benevolence, and courage, in order to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People and bring the world to a state of great harmony." Its breadth and depth of meaning are in line with the Great Learning's path of sincerity, rectification, cultivation, family management, state governance, and world peace. It also coincides with the overall meaning described by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen in his lectures on nationalism. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that Boy Scout education is the central education of China's current primary and secondary education. Now, time is urgent, and the enemy is deep. Given China's current situation, if we cannot concentrate our thoughts, beliefs, and actions, and catch up quickly by intensifying youth training, then under an overturned nest, how can there be intact eggs? I hope that the tens of millions of youth across the country and those responsible for youth training will encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Elementary School Students Raise Funds to Cast a Sword, Presented to Chairman Chiang, Department of Education Appoints Representatives to Send to the Capital Within the Month, American Girl Donates Five American Cents</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education previously received a suggestion from representatives of children from Tongshan County and other places to have elementary school children throughout the province save their snack money to raise funds to cast a sword and present it to Chairman Chiang, requesting him to wear it to complete the task of reviving the nation. The department immediately formulated six measures and issued them to elementary schools in all counties and provincial elementary schools for compliance. It also stipulated that each child must donate at least one copper coin to contribute to this grand undertaking. The Department of Education is responsible for overseeing the production of the sword. It is now learned that the fundraising has been completed, and the sword has also been cast. Within this month, the Department of Education will appoint representatives from the Zhenjiang Experimental Elementary School and the Zhenjiang Normal School Affiliated Elementary School to go to the capital and respectfully present the sword, along with their wishes for his birthday. The cost of the sword is one thousand yuan. The blade is made of pure steel and is three feet long. Engraved on both sides are the words "Respectfully presented by elementary school students throughout Jiangsu Province, September of the 25th year of the Republic of China." The handle and scabbard are made of high-quality silver inlaid with nine-tenths gold plum blossom patterns. The handle is attached with silk tassels, and the scabbard has a silver chain and is enclosed in a brocade box. The surface of the box lid is painted with the Kuomintang emblem and inscribed with the four characters "Leader of the Masses" and the inscription "Respectfully Presented to Chairman Chiang, by Elementary School Students Throughout Jiangsu Province." The sword has a magnificent form and a glorious aura, stemming from the sincerity of the elementary school students, and is specially presented for the leader of the party and the nation to wear. It not only expresses their admiration but also symbolizes the spirit of unity and solidarity among the entire nation. At this time of national crisis, it is even more sufficient to promote the spirit of martial valor and a united defense against aggression. Its significance can be said to be very profound. In addition, among the funds for casting the sword were five American cents donated by an American twelve-year-old girl named Gao Pei (approximately equivalent to 17 cents in Chinese currency), which were also included. The girl has always admired China and respected Chairman Chiang. Upon hearing of the sword presentation, she volunteered to join from afar, sending her savings to the Chinese Embassy in the United States with a request to forward them. Although this amount is small, it is sufficient to show the concern of people from friendly nations. Even a three-foot child knows to send us their sympathy, which cannot be said to be without great significance.</p>

<p>Tung Wah Defeats Jinan by a Large Margin</p>
<p>In the first team competition, only the two Chinese teams, Tung Wah and Jinan, competed against each other yesterday at the Municipal Sports Field. The result was that Tung Wah won by eight goals. The score at halftime was 5-0. Although Jinan still suffered a crushing defeat, their connection technique was different from last week. In the second half, Tung Wah was threatened by multiple attacks. There was no progress in the first five minutes. Wan Xianghua dribbled straight in and shot at the bottom corner of the left, hitting the net. Jinan fought bravely, but failed. Tung Wah continued to press, but missed many good opportunities due to impatience. However, the Jinan penalty area was constantly in turmoil. Jia and Sun coordinated extremely well and were very active. Jinan was also not weak and repeatedly created dangerous situations for Tung Wah. In the 30 minutes of stalemate, there were no gains or losses. Soon after, Sun Jinshun scored again. In the next eight minutes, Wan Xianghua and Jia Youliang each scored, ending the first half with a score of 5-0. At the start of the second half, Jinan launched a fierce counterattack, but was blocked by Li Yichen and Li Ning. For fifteen minutes, the ball was circling at Jinan's feet. After half an hour, Tung Wah regained the advantage. Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang, and Xu Wenkui each scored a goal, resulting in a score of 8-0.</p>

<p>Tung Wah Defeats St. Francis</p>
<p>The Tung Wah Reserve Team played against St. Francis at 3:00 PM on the National Day at the Municipal Sports Field in the Shanghai League Reserve Group competition. Sun Jinshun and Jia Youliang, who had just returned from the World Games, and Chen Zhenhe, who recently joined Tung Wah, all took to the field to test their skills because they had been traveling for a long time. St. Francis, except for one R. Remy, were all reserves. The difference in strength was like heaven and earth. Therefore, the whole game was one-sided. As a result, after Tung Wah's Sun Huizhang opened the scoring, they continued to score one after another. The first half ended with a score of 7-0. In the second half, they continued to score five goals, resulting in Tung Wah winning by a large margin of 12-0. The scoring record was Sun Jinshun with six goals, Jia Jiliang with three, Youliang with two, and Sun Huizhang with one. The Tung Wah lineup was as follows:</p>

<p>Autumn Scenery</p>
<h3>Autumn Feelings</h3>
<p>— (Xuewen)</p>
<p>The few clumps of green grass in front of the steps seemed unable to withstand the wind of mid-autumn, already revealing a dim expression.</p>
<p>The crickets in the corner of the wall, like sentimental poets, hummed and chanted, their voices so desolate and plaintive! It seemed that their hearts concealed infinite misery, uttering cries of injustice.</p>
<p>The sky was high, so clear and refreshing, and the cotton-like white clouds floated in piles and patches, changing constantly, now like birds and beasts, now transformed into mountains and rivers, plains...</p>
<p>The autumn wind swept across the earth, carrying a desolate atmosphere everywhere, blowing over the treetops, blowing over the clouds, blowing over the clear sky.</p>
<p>The swallows, these sensitive migratory birds from the north that know the seasons well, returned! With their companions. The old nests on the beams were coldly empty, empty...</p>
<p>The streets always seemed like dusk, and people moved deeply, as if everything was covered with a layer of sluggish shadows, lacking vitality and life.</p>
<p>The wounds in my own heart, like scratches from a cat, aroused a wisp of sorrow. Facing this present scene, I recalled my hometown thousands of miles away, the old events of years ago...</p>
<p>I fell into contemplation.</p>
<h3>The Seductive Moonlight</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The remaining lotus flowers in the pond no longer had the sight of lush green canopies standing tall. The surrounding scenery was also very bleak and clear. Only the sound of reading aloud came from afar behind the pond, and the chirping of insects beneath the steps seemed to echo each other. Raising my head, the bright moon was in the sky, as if urging people to fantasize. Originally, the autumn moon was most likely to arouse the reverie of travelers. "Moonlight before the bed, suspected to be frost on the ground; raising my head to see the bright moon, lowering my head to think of my hometown." This is the homesickness aroused by wanderers facing the moon. "A piece of moon over Chang'an, ten thousand households pounding clothes; the autumn wind blows endlessly, always the feeling of Yuguan; when will the barbarians be pacified? The good man will stop the long expedition." This is the reverie of a thoughtful woman arousing thoughts of her husband on an expedition. People have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason. Now, within the school, young men and women, facing this seductive moonlight, are probably also thinking of their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, or sweethearts.</p>
<p>The most enviable and hateful of all are the headmaster and his wife. They have been newly married for a short time and are truly happy every morning and sweet every night. They usually hold hands and lean shoulder to shoulder, patrolling inside and outside the school, already arousing all kinds of fantasies among the young people. And that night, the couple stood side by side by the pond again, whispering sweet words in each other's ears. After the bell rang, they retreated to their bedrooms, and the hearts of the young people could not help but throb at the sight of this moonlight and this couple. After a short while, the high-pitched singing of "In the sky, we wish to be birds flying wing to wing; on earth, we wish to be trees with intertwined branches" suddenly came from afar. It is unknown whether this was cursing this couple or praying that their moon would be round even after it waned. There was no way to find out. And they, looking at each other and smiling, could not help but kiss wildly before slowly returning to their residence.</p>
<p>That night, in the dreams of the young people, they were either thinking of "Sister Lin" or looking forward to "Brother Bao," and they smiled and harmonized with the headmaster and his wife in their dreams until dawn. Ah, this autumn night moonlight! In this situation, people—especially young men and women—truly cannot push it away or settle down!</p>
<h3>Calling for Lights by the Fence</h3>
<p>— Licheng</p>
<p>Reading Jiang Baishi's "Qitianle" ode to the cricket, when I got to the two lines "laughing at the lights called for by the fence, the sons and daughters of the world," I had many reveries in my heart, so I wrote them down below. Crickets are also called weaving insects, originally autumn insects. The best ones are: white hemp head, blue silk forehead, oily spatula, crab shell green, plum blossom wings, praying mantis shape, blue neck, golden wings... There are many names, all recorded in Liu Tong's "Treatise on Weaving Insects." The "Book of Odes" says: "...In May, the locusts move their thighs; in June, the sand chickens shake their wings; in July, they are in the fields; in August, they are in the eaves; in September, they are in the households; in October, the crickets enter under my bed..." (The Zhou Dynasty established Zi as the first month, so his October is the eighth month of the lunar calendar). The locusts, sand chickens, and crickets mentioned are all the same thing, but they change with the seasons and have different names.</p>
<p>When I was a child, what I liked most was catching crickets. Every day after school, after eating dinner, I didn't ride a bamboo horse, didn't kick a shuttlecock, didn't pat a leather ball, but only took a bamboo tube and wire mesh with a few children from the same house, and waited specifically outside the lonely and uninhabited vegetable garden, in the fence courtyard, by the broken wall feet, and around the flower stand, quietly listening to the crickets chirping. Knowing where they were, we called them to strike matches, light lanterns, and carry out the work of catching them, turning over stones, digging wall holes, "cutting through thorns and thistles," making a lot of noise. We weren't afraid of snakes, centipedes, or ghosts. At that time, even the "carefree emperor" was probably not as happy as me.</p>
<p>Alas! Time passes so quickly, childhood has passed, and autumn insects under the fence can no longer be caught. What is the reason for this? Speaking of it, I also find myself funny. Every day I get up at dawn and work until the lights come on, processing those troublesome documents, sending them for signing, sending them for review, sending them for judgment, sending them for copying, sending them for printing, filing them, one by one extracting the reasons, one by one canceling the numbers. Countless trivial things. No interest at all. After eating dinner, I just want to lie in a wicker chair. In short, "it's unbearable to look back on the past"!</p>
<p>Originally, the works of the ancients in autumn were all very good; in terms of poetry, there were autumn boudoir complaints, autumn palace complaints, autumn excitement, autumn thoughts... In terms of prose, there was also Song Yu's "Nine Arguments" and Ouyang Yongshu's "Autumn Sound Rhapsody." But I always feel that they are not as interesting as Old Jiang's "Cricket Ode," especially the sentence "calling for lights by the fence."</p>
<h3>An Eventful Autumn</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Autumn Jasmine</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>Jasmine, according to legend, originated in Persia. Now it is planted in all warm areas of the South. The "Records of Lu Jia's Southern Journey" of the Han Dynasty states: "The five grains of Nanyue have no flavor, and a hundred flowers are not fragrant, but only jasmine does not change with the water and soil." Therefore, those produced in Fujian and Guangdong have thick trunks and sturdy stems, reaching a height of three to four feet, with single and double petals. Only south of the Yangtze River, there are varieties that are vine-like and grow in clusters, reaching over ten feet in length, with leaves similar to tea but larger, which is a peculiarity. The names of jasmine are varied. In the "Bencao" (Materia Medica) and "Caomu Zhuang" (Descriptions of Plants and Trees), both books write "Moli." The "Luoyang Famous Garden Records" writes "Moli." Buddhist scriptures write "Mali." Wang Guiling's collection writes "Moli." Hong Mai's collection writes "Moli." It can be inferred that the two characters "Moli" are not standard Chinese, and the interpretation varies from person to person. Yang Shen's "Danqianlu" says: "The people of Jin Dynasty wore Nai flowers, which are today's jasmine, and Dongpo called it 'secret musk'," with the line "Secret musk perfumes the jasmine in hair," likely referring to its fragrance.</p>
<p>The flowers bloom continuously from early summer to late autumn. Its shape resembles a small lotus, and the most prized is called "Treasure Pearl Jasmine," with flower buds initially small like pearls, and especially in the scorching autumn sun, it emits fragrance, making it seem even more delicate and lovely. By dusk, the entire courtyard is filled with subtle fragrance, which can be smelled from afar, not inferior to spring orchids. Planters regularly remove tender branches to promote lush growth, and the buds are particularly purple. It thrives in warmth, and the more sunlight, the more abundant the blooms. For watering, rice water or soybean juice and fishy water are also suitable, but it must be applied in the afternoon, otherwise uneven temperature changes can damage its vitality. After this autumn day, enrich with fertile soil, hide in a sunny place, and after the Qingming Festival in spring, it can be moved out. However, it is still vulnerable to the southeast wind and insects gnawing at its roots, all of which must be prevented in advance. During the plum rain season, if you cut off the stem at the node and embed a grain of barley at the cut, wrap it with tangled hair, and insert it in a shady and humid place, the branch will take root. This is a simple planting method.</p>
<p>There is a type of "Purple Jasmine," also called "Zhuangyuanhong" (Top Scholar Red), but it is sprawling and easy to grow. It only blooms in late autumn, but it blooms in the morning and closes by noon, and its fragrance is very faint, so it is not valued. Even if it bears fruit, it is merely for show. Compared to "Jasmine," which can be used as women's hair ornaments, use colored silk to thread the flower core to make cloud tassels, called "Manhua" (flower wreath), or "Jade Hairpin," which are far better. The root of "Jasmine," when soaked in wine, causes numbness. Even if one cup does not cause unconsciousness, it is its characteristic and should not be tasted lightly. The "Guangdong Provincial Annals" states, "In the two states of Leiqiong, there is Yellow Jasmine, named Huangxin." I don't know if it's "Golden Jasmine," so I dare not say for sure.</p>

<h3>A Visit to Manjuelong for Osmanthus</h3>
<p>— Li Xufei</p>
<p>Hangzhou has different scenery in the four seasons, so it is no wonder that travelers never cease to visit throughout the year. I have lived in Hangzhou three times, and I am fond of traveling, boating on the lake, enjoying flowers, even participating in oath-taking gatherings in mountains. I have never failed to wear out my shoes on leisure days. Manjuelong is located in the middle of Nanshan Longjing. Every time the autumn breeze brings a refreshing breeze and the sweet osmanthus fragrance fills the air, tens of thousands of tourists come. The flowers bloomed earlier this year, and after receiving a letter from Junzhang, I went there with Junzhang's wife and Ms. Chunyin on the 21st.</p>
<p>Those who visit Manjuelong usually start from Hubin, either by boat to Chishanbu, or by car to Siyan Jing, and then walk for about a mile to reach the destination. We went in the afternoon, and from a glance at Hubin, we saw ten thousand people crowding the streets, all coming out to enjoy the osmanthus in Manjuelong, dressed in new clothes.</p>
<p>We went by rickshaw, and the slow, light vehicle was better than a car or boat. The road on Nanshan was no longer comparable to that of Shanyin. The new carriages raised dust for ten miles, and the sound of wheels and people was as noisy as the capital. We covered our mouths and held our breaths, almost not knowing whether to laugh or cry. We came to escape the mundane, but we were bringing back dust. How could we have expected such a thing?</p>
<p>Manjuelong extends for miles. Usually, it is a narrow and desolate village, but on this day, it was full of people in every valley, shoulder to shoulder, heel to heel, with voices booming. However, the abundant flowers filled the branches, and the strong fragrance filled the heart, almost intoxicating people upon entering Manjuelong. The people along the Longkou set out all their belongings, cooking tea and peeling chestnuts, all competing to trade. The cemetery under the trees is now monopolized. The so-called eternal separation between the living and the dead is only a few feet of yellow earth away.</p>
<p>We bought a seat under a tree and sipped tea for a while. The yellow and white osmanthus were as brilliant as the setting sun, and the fragrant scent was carried by the breeze. The mountainside and ridges were almost covered in osmanthus, making them both visually appealing and fragrant enough to fill one's belly. There were also young children shouting and selling flowers, handfuls of which were worth only a few coins. This was truly a disaster for the woodcutters and a sigh for the burnt Paulownia trees. Furthermore, it is said that after the flowers have faded, the residents collect them to make fragrant cakes and sell them to gluttons, relying on them as their annual income. As twilight fell, we also returned home and wrote this record four days later.</p>
<h3>Swapped Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Deep Sibling Affection Hides a Letter to Pity the Weak Sister; Heavy Literary Air Spies on a Shadow, Laughing at a Poor Scholar</p>
<p>When Menglan returned to her room, the old servant brought in a note, on which was written: "Please, sister, accompany brother to Shi Guanyin Nunnery and the Dushu Terrace area for a walk at six o'clock early tomorrow morning. Do not be late. Brother Wubai." Menglan held the note in her hand, unable to help but be stunned. Her elder brother had never asked her to go out together, especially so early in the morning. What did he want to do with me? The maid saw her eyes fixed on the note, flipping it back and forth. She said, "Miss, what are you thinking about? How shall I reply to the young master?" Menglan nodded repeatedly and said, "I'll go, I'll go. Go tell him." As she said this, she dismissed the maid, but she was full of doubts, not knowing what her brother wanted to do. Based on his personality, he was probably going to bring up a grand theory to persuade her about her marriage. Fortunately, she had consistent opinions on this matter, so no matter how her brother questioned her, she would stick to her guns tomorrow and not need to overthink it. She cleared her mind and went to sleep peacefully. The next morning, fearing that she would be late, she immediately got out of bed, threw on her clothes, and quickly combed her hair. Not wanting to disturb the servants, she went to the kitchen herself to get water and washed her face. Then she went to the front room to meet her brother. But Wuxuan was already looking impatient, his hands tucked in his pockets, pacing back and forth in the courtyard. When Menglan arrived in front of him, he broke the worried expression on his face, relaxed his eyebrows, and revealed a hint of a smile. He said, "Let's go then? The weather is good, we can go to a spacious place to breathe in some fresh morning air." Menglan nodded twice and followed him out. In the southeastern corner of Nanjing City, there was a large open space where farmers grew vegetable gardens. Near the foot of the city wall, a small hill, a branch of Yuhuatai, extended into the area. This small hill was not made of soil, but a whole large stone, arching out from the earth. (83)</p>
<h3>Autumn Scenery of Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>The steamboat left the Xukou Gate, and then came the vast Taihu Lake with its 36,000 hectares of water, a sheet of shimmering waves, countless sails, and vaguely visible mountains. This magnificent Taihu Lake is like the sea, and also like the desert.</p>
<p>Waves crashed one by one against the side of the boat, making our steamboat seem like a startled animal, leaping and running wildly, causing the passengers to hide in the corners of the cabin trembling. Some timid women even cried, screamed, and vomited; there was an unusual commotion on the whole boat, but at this critical moment, what could we do besides entrusting our entire lives to the captain!</p>
<p>Many sails tilted and moved in this vast expanse of misty waves, but the sun always hid in the clouds, afraid to show its face. The clouds and mountains were vast, and the lake was boundless. Oh, great nature! I would like to destroy my soul in this way, never to see the filthy world and the evil society again.</p>
<p>The entire silhouette of Dongting West Mountain was clearly reflected in my eyes; first, we passed by Yuantouzhu, followed by Turtle Mountain and Shigong Mountain. The boat entered Miaoshanzhu, which is Xiaoxia Bay; not only was the water as smooth as a mirror, but it was also clear to the bottom, with patches of old water shield leaves floating on the surface, and the fragrance of caltrop and lotus drifted from the front lotus pond, vaguely mixed with a kind of melodious singing, but it was unclear whether the singing was from men or women.</p>
<p>The sun was already slanting past the summit of Piaomiao Peak. In this twilight sunset, the lake and mountains were like a painting, the water stretched out smoothly, the distant shadows of birds, the glow in the sky, all the peaks, and all the trees were covered with a golden robe.</p>
<p>"The sunset glow and the lone duck fly together, the autumn water shares the same color as the long sky." In this scene and setting, I truly doubted that I had entered a painting myself. Especially the dustpan-shaped Su Mian Mountain Peak, overlapping and undulating, steep and rugged, reflecting the beautiful lake and the gentle water, like a hero facing a beauty.</p>
<p>Xiaoxia Bay, according to legend, was where King Wu and Xi Shi once spent the summer, and "Xiaoxia Fishing Song" is one of the Eight Views of Dongting, because once you enter Miaoshanzhu, it is all fish ponds and lotus ponds; every summer, not only is the climate mild, but the scenery is also very beautiful. Those young fishermen in the pond, men and women, worked with their hands, but naturally sang together with their mouths, and this song lightly drifted to the shore, rippling in that small fishing village, rippling.</p>
<p>There are many good local products there, such as lotus pods, lotus roots, water shield, caltrop, water caltrop dumplings, etc.; but in recent years, the lives of the fishermen there have also been difficult! There is either too much water in the pond one year, and when there is too much water, they cannot catch fish, or there is too little water one year, and when there is too little water, they cannot grow water caltrop. Therefore, what everyone once considered a paradise has now become a living hell.</p>
<p>The boat passed through several weirs, and entered from the side of a lotus pond. The old lotus leaves were shaking their heads at us, and several withered lotus flowers lowered their heads, like a haggard widow weeping to people. Looking out into the distance, the villagers in Xiaoxia town were making dinner; wisps of smoke rose from the black roof ridges, circling around, like a tent covering them, leaving only a vague outline.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>Currency Problems After the Franc Devaluation</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jie</p>
<p>(I) Reasons for the Franc Devaluation</p>
<p>This franc devaluation and the collapse of the Gold Bloc were expected by the financial circles of Britain and the United States long ago. Because it could not adapt to the international currency devaluation war and maintained an excessively high gold parity, it led to economic, financial, and monetary panic, fundamentally shaking the gold standard foundation. (Note 1) However, this situation had existed for a long time, so why did the devaluation only occur today? There must be important immediate causes. According to general public opinion, it was all caused by the Spanish issue, but in reality, it is more than that. According to our observation, the recent changes in the political situation in Southeast Europe are the direct cause. Originally, Romania relied entirely on French economic assistance and, along with Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, belonged to the Peace Front. However, in recent years, France's own economy and finances have been very difficult due to its adherence to the gold standard, and it has been unable to take care of others. Germany took this opportunity to extend its power, and German Finance Minister Schacht toured the Danube River basin four months ago, offering great inducements, and the attitude of the Little Entente countries leaning towards Germany became obvious. Looking at the general trend in Europe, since the establishment of the German-Austrian agreement and the understanding between Rome and Italy, Italy has tacitly acquiesced to Germany's economic power invading Southeast Europe, so the Fascist front is becoming increasingly consolidated. France naturally suffered a great threat in this situation and felt uneasy. Therefore, it urgently wanted to unite Poland to contain Germany. Now that the Franco-Polish agreement has been established, the main item in the agreement is that France must lend 225 million francs to Poland. Given France's current financial difficulties, where would this surplus of huge sums come from to help others? Therefore, if France stubbornly clung to the gold standard, causing the whole country to be in a state of financial panic, not to mention how it would suffer economic sacrifices, France's political status would immediately be untenable. At this critical juncture where "France and the franc cannot coexist," the devaluation of the franc is not surprising.</p>
<p>At the same time, Britain and the United States, in view of the repeated panic of the franc, which was precarious, sooner or later had to resort to devaluation. During this transitional period, international finance was in a state of tense confrontation every day, and the monetary policies of various countries adopted a wartime attitude, with central banks hoarding gold and not allowing it to circulate, leading to international trade being unable to develop and the world economy unable to recover. It was when the currency war reached a point where everyone felt the pain that they suddenly wanted to negotiate a truce. Therefore, in response to France's request, Britain and the United States established the Tripartite Monetary Agreement, and Britain and the United States agreed to provide substantial assistance to France's currency reform, so that France had no worries about foreign affairs. This is another important immediate cause of the franc devaluation.</p>
<p>(II) The Debate in the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies</p>
<p>This franc devaluation was originally inevitable in terms of economics, politics, and the rules of the monetary system. However, when the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies discussed the new currency bill proposed by the government, it still caused fierce debate. The centralists and the right-wing launched fierce attacks on the government, opposing devaluation. Finally, the entire bill was barely passed in the Senate by a margin of only ten votes. It can be seen that the forces within France that hinder devaluation are still not to be ignored. The traditions, thoughts, and fears of the people regarding currency devaluation are still decisive, and France's agricultural characteristics and the economic structure centered on those living on gold interest are the main factors creating this force. (Note 2)</p>
<p>In fact, the French government, compelled by the situation, had already decided to implement currency devaluation, and it was difficult to reverse. Therefore, the struggle between the left and right wings over the new currency bill was mainly focused on the revision of the articles. The main points of the currency bill initially proposed by the government were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Abolish the 1928 gold standard currency law. From then on, the legal price of the franc was set between 0.043 grams and 0.049 grams of nine-tenths gold. Compared with the original 0.0655 grams of nine-tenths gold, the depreciation was between one-quarter and one-third.</p>
<p>(2) Establish an exchange equalization fund, which is used by the Bank of France, with the purpose of stabilizing the currency.</p>
<p>(3) Calculate the value of the Bank of France's gold reserves based on the new currency value, and the resulting surplus of 13 billion francs will be mostly allocated to the exchange equalization fund.</p>
<p>(4) Nationalize all gold in the country and prohibit the import, export, and transaction of gold coins.</p>
<p>(5) Adjust wages to be commensurate with the price index.</p>
<p>The struggle in the two houses of parliament over this bill can be said to be concentrated on the last article. Originally, whether the adjustment of wages and prices was appropriate was greatly related to the future of France's new monetary policy. If prices are not controlled, they will inevitably be stimulated by the devaluation and gradually rise. Once the extent of the price increase is equivalent to the extent of the franc devaluation, the benefits of the franc devaluation for international trade will be completely lost. At the same time, if wages and general salaries cannot be increased in proportion to prices, the public will be burdened and become victims of the franc devaluation. After that, the outbreak of labor unrest is inevitable. However, if wages are increased, the cost of production will increase, and prices will also rise, still falling into the same danger. Therefore, it is necessary to control prices, but the desires of industrialists are exactly the opposite. They are unwilling to have prices strictly bound, which would hinder the acquisition of profits. On this point, the interests of capitalists and the interests of workers are difficult to reconcile properly. Therefore, this bill conflicted in the two houses of parliament. The first step was to reach a compromise in the Chamber of Deputies. Premier Blum agreed to cancel the provision in the bill for "gradually increasing wages" and replace it with an article "authorizing the government to prevent price increases." However, this amendment still could not be passed in the Senate. Finally, a compromise was reached, stipulating that "if the standard of living increases due to currency devaluation, resulting in social disputes, the government may resolve it by mandatory arbitration, but the National Economic Commission must be consulted in advance." According to this plan, public pain will not be considered until prices rise to the point of causing social disputes. It can be seen that the interests of capitalists still occupy a dominant position.</p>
<p>After this resolution was passed, the government issued two orders closely related to the price issue. One was to reduce relationship, which struck a blow to rising prices. The other was to prohibit unreasonable price increases. In this way, the conflict between labor and management may be eased. However, in fact, price increases are inevitable, and the boundary of "unreasonable price increases" is difficult to judge. This is a concern. On October 4, there was a large-scale Communist demonstration in western Paris, which was clearly related to this matter.</p>
<p>Secondly, what is worth noting in the new currency bill, which once became a point of contention, is that the extent of the franc devaluation was not clearly specified, but only a range of devaluation was specified, that is, between one-quarter and one-third. This reserves room for the government to continue to devalue in the future, and France can use monetary policy to deal with the international economic war. This is the same as the situation in the United States and Belgium in the past. The United States initially stipulated that the limit of devaluation was 50% to 60%, and then determined it to be 59.06%. Belgium initially stipulated that the limit of devaluation was 70% to 75%, and then determined it to be 72%. (Note 3) The French government has not yet determined this point. On September 30, the exchange rate of the franc sold by the Bank of France to the Bank of England was 96 francs per pound. By October 5, it had fallen to 05.41 francs. Therefore, capital has flowed in four directions, which has not yet been seen. However, according to observations in the London financial community, the French government will soon determine the extent of the devaluation, and the determined point will be close to the maximum devaluation limit, reducing the range of changes in the price of the franc in the future in order to stabilize the monetary system, and then French capital abroad can flow back.</p>
<p>(III) The Impact of the Franc Devaluation</p>
<p>After the franc devaluation, the question of how to manage the impact on France is extremely important. If managed properly, financial stability and the return of capital can be achieved, and tangible benefits can be immediately seen. At this time, France needs a large amount of capital for economic development, and this will naturally be very effective. After that, France's prices and production will gradually rise, foreign trade and foreign income and expenditure will gradually improve, and thus finances will find a way out, so that the French economy, which has been in decline for many years, can be temporarily revived. However, if managed improperly, financial stability cannot be achieved, the political situation remains turbulent, or major labor unrest is caused by labor-management conflicts, then French capital can still remain abroad, and the domestic economy still cannot be revived. As it looks now, this situation is not likely to materialize.</p>
<p>As for the right-wing congressmen's attacks on the government, comparing this franc devaluation to the financial panic after the European war is an exaggeration. The reason why the French people suffered the pain of the franc's sharp decline and inflation after the war was due to its lack of planning, preparation, and strict management. The current situation is very different.</p>
<p>However, according to the French authorities, it seems that economic prosperity can be achieved once and for all after the franc devaluation. This optimistic attitude is also unfounded. In the long term, the benefits that France can obtain from devaluation are also very limited. In today's situation where the whole world has devalued, France can only be exempted from the monetary sacrifices it has suffered over the years from devaluation, but it cannot obtain international advantages from devaluation like Britain and the United States did in the past. This is not only the case for France, but all those who praise currency devaluation as a "panacea" should deeply realize this and take this view.</p>
<p>Now let us look back at the impact of the franc devaluation on the international community. The first thing is the change in international exchange relations. It was expected that Switzerland and the Netherlands would follow France and implement devaluation. Following Switzerland and the Netherlands, Greece, Latvia, Czechoslovakia, Italy and other countries have successively devalued. The German government declared that it would not change its financial policy, but the result will inevitably be devaluation. Because Germany's policy of controlled trade and controlled foreign exchange has made the economy isolated and difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>However, after these countries devalue, the status of their currencies cannot be isolated. They must choose to link to either Britain or the United States. Currently, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Latvia, Austria, Turkey, and other countries have joined the pound bloc, so the key after that is still linked to the actions of Britain and the United States. If the United States and Britain cannot coordinate and adopt retaliatory devaluation competition, the currencies of all countries will fall into chaos, and the world economy will undoubtedly suffer a great blow. With the advantageous position of Britain and the United States today, they should not be willing to do this. Therefore, the Tripartite Monetary Agreement was established before the franc devaluation to prevent this unfortunate situation, and Britain, the United States, and France simultaneously issued a declaration to maintain exchange rate balance, promote peace, and invite other countries to join the cooperation. It allows countries to calmly sort out and reduce tariffs, and calls on the world to reduce tariff barriers. This is indeed a pioneering initiative in international monetary history, and it is a realm that the 1933 World Economic Conference dreamed of but could not achieve.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content of this Tripartite Monetary Agreement, we can see that after a long war, they have realized that the currency war cannot be completely resolved solely in the currency field. Its basic cause lies in the economic policies of modern nationalism. "To demand currency stability, a permanent balance must be established in various economic systems before it can be obtained, so international economic relations should be further improved," this was proposed by France and welcomed by Britain and the United States. Therefore, following the agreement, on October 7, Britain and France suggested to the Economic Committee of the League of Nations to reduce obstacles to international trade and advised member states to implement and even abolish the current trade quota system and exchange control system. This cannot be said to be without sincerity. However, it must be pointed out that there are fundamental contradictions in the modern economic system, and a permanent balance is almost ideal. Some people hold excessive optimism, believing that world monetary balance is just around the corner. Once balance is achieved, countries around the world will agree to restore the monetary system to a gold-based system and establish lasting peace. If the future of the agreement can proceed smoothly, this speculation is premature. We should note that the British monetary authorities have repeatedly stated that the value of the pound is too high for the currencies of other countries in the world other than the gold bloc currencies. Now that not only the gold bloc has implemented devaluation, but many European countries have successively devalued. Whether Britain can tolerate this and stop its previous pound price reduction policy is still unknown. In addition, there are also problems between Britain and the United States. According to a Paris telegram on September 27, Britain advocated suppressing the current value to 4.50 U.S. dollars per pound, while the United States insisted that it should not be lower than 4.99 U.S. dollars. It is now believed that both sides have made concessions, allowing the pound price to fluctuate between 4.80 and 4.90 U.S. dollars. For the time being, it will not cause serious conflicts. At the same time, the United Kingdom and the United States issued the same statement denying that the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar has strictly stipulated the exchange rate. These are all omens of future world monetary disputes.</p>
<p>However, objectively speaking, the franc devaluation, which was preceded by a currency agreement between countries, has many commendable aspects in its international impact.</p>
<p>It is conducive to the circulation of gold between countries. Since the franc panic, hoarding has been rampant, so that gold has been subject to various restrictions and cannot be used as currency reserves and international trade payments. Now that the franc problem has been resolved, hoarded gold can be released in large quantities. In addition, the net increase in gold in recent years is very considerable. Once it is circulated, world trade and prices will naturally flourish. In the past, the United States prohibited the export of gold (except to gold standard countries). For a long time, it formed a situation where gold flowed from Europe to the United States. After the franc devaluation, the United States has begun to consider lifting the gold ban. As for the repatriation of French capital abroad, which can help economic development, it is a secondary issue.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is to raise the world gold price. After the gold bloc devalued, the pound price will fall relatively. Therefore, the London gold price calculated in pounds rose. At present, the world gold price is based on London, so the gold prices of all countries will rise, and the currency value will also fall relatively, indirectly giving the world price an opportunity to recover.</p>
<p>However, if the gold price rises too high suddenly, the currency will naturally lose its stability, and the harm will be greater. On this point, Britain has the power to suppress it. First, Britain, France, and the United States have signed an agreement that the currency value must not fall excessively, and the gold price in the United States has not changed, and it is still 35 U.S. dollars per ounce. Second, the British exchange equalization fund has always bought a lot of gold. Even if the repatriation of French capital causes a selling trend of the pound, the fund can sell gold and absorb pounds, giving the gold price a restraining force. Therefore, the London gold price of around 141 shillings will not rise too far for the time being.</p>
<p>The Shanghai gold market was also affected by the franc devaluation. Last week (September 26 to October 2), the gold price soared, from 1127 yuan on September 25 to a maximum of 1163 yuan on October 1, the strongest surge since the implementation of the new currency policy. In fact, this is not only due to the stimulation of the rise in the London gold price after the franc devaluation. At the same time, it is also affected by the change in foreign exchange due to the franc devaluation; in addition, the current situation is tense, bringing up rumors about our country's currency. Speculators took the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the gold price rose sharply. However, the currency rumors will eventually cool down, and the London gold price has stabilized at around 140 shillings. The Shanghai gold price has gradually fallen back, and it has fallen to 1153 yuan on October 5. After that, any major fluctuations in the Shanghai gold price will not have much relationship with the London gold price.</p>
<p>Secondly, the impact of the franc devaluation on the international foreign exchange market is not bad. Except for the complete shutdown of the London foreign exchange market on September 26, the foreign exchange markets in other places have opened. From October 2, the franc exchange rate has also opened.</p>
<p>In China, foreign exchange transactions have not stopped. The exchange rate against the franc has risen from the usual exchange rate of about 455 francs per 100 Chinese yuan to 630 francs on October 5. At the same time, the exchange rate against the pound has become looser, and the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar has become tighter. This is the natural result of the fall in the exchange rate between Britain and the United States, and it is not surprising. As for the prosperity of these major foreign exchange transactions, there are reasons.</p>
<p>In summary, the process and impact of this franc devaluation are satisfactory. However, the entire currency future of the world cannot be estimated solely from the franc devaluation.</p>
<p>Note 1 and Note 2: For the fundamental reasons for the franc crisis and the domestic factors for France to maintain the gold standard, please refer to my book "The Franc and Its International Relations," published in the Dongfang Magazine, Volume 33, Issue 17.</p>
<p>Note 3: The devaluation limits of the United States and Belgium mentioned here are different from the devaluation limit of France in terms of calculation. The former refers to the remaining part after devaluation, while the latter refers to the part that has been devalued. —October 6—</p>
<h3>Review of Germany's Economic Plan</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>(1) The New Four-Year Economic Plan</p>
<p>During the National Socialist Party Congress this time, Hitler announced the Second New Four-Year Economic Plan, attempting to achieve complete independence from international sources for Germany's industrial raw materials through another four years of effort. If we consider the achievements Germany has made in the economic sphere over the past four years, then we can expect even greater achievements in the next four years, rather than empty delusions. Indeed, after the war, Germany's economic situation was already precarious. Today, Germany has been able to recover, and its domestic economic situation has become considerably more stable. We cannot help but admire the efforts of the German people, and it is, of course, possible that the second four-year economic plan will be completed on schedule. Although people generally know that Germany lacks raw materials, and its colonies have not returned to their pre-war state, who can predict that the Germans, with their courage, determination, and hard work, will not achieve even greater success in the next four years?</p>
<p>(2) Achievements of the Past Four Years</p>
<p>If we consider the achievements of Germany's economic construction over the past four years, based on the report of the International Trade Bureau, then Germany's economic situation has indeed made special progress. Under the guidance of the German government, the people are working hard for economic self-sufficiency. The progress in agriculture, the huge military expenditure, and the rapid progress in public works, all prove that Germany's economic situation is much more stable than in previous years. However, on the other hand, we also acknowledge that German industry still feels the lack of domestic raw materials. Its new policies are determined according to current needs, but on the other hand, they do not violate the National Socialist Party's attitude towards Germany's economic situation and industry and commerce, that is, based on National Socialism, all kinds of activities in Germany must be unified and controlled. All countries importing raw materials, merchants engaged in import and export, and even how ordinary workers work, are determined by the National Socialist Party. All workers who have joined the "Labor Front" are all relatively comfortable members of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>(3) Astonishing Development of Agriculture</p>
<p>In the economic sphere, it is divided into five categories: agriculture, industry, handicrafts, transportation, and the "Labor Front." The most progressive of these is agriculture, because the National Socialist Party believes that the health of rural residents is not only of considerable importance in the economic sphere, but can also produce a great anti-communist force in the political sphere. Therefore, they have established 700,000 farms that cannot be used as collateral under any circumstances, driving all farmers from the cities back to the countryside, raising wheat prices so that farmers can repay their debts. Therefore, the current wheat price in Germany is higher than any world market. Separating large landholdings so that small landowners can afford to buy them, and at the same time, making every effort to turn tenant farmers into small landowners who own their land. As a result, the number of German farms decreased rapidly from 223,000 in 1932 to 52,000 in 1935. At the same time, German farmers repaid 50,000,000 pounds of debt in these four years. The National Socialist government is also making every effort to encourage all German farmers to adopt scientific methods of farming. It is said that four out of five German farmers now have access to electricity, but in the United States, only one out of eight does. As a result, 80% of the food needed by the whole of Germany can now be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>(4) Lack of Industrial Raw Materials</p>
<p>If we further look at Germany's import and export statistics in recent years, then most of Germany's imports exceed exports, except for those from the United Kingdom. Germany's exports to the UK seem to be more than its imports from the UK, and Germany's imports from the UK are mostly wool, cotton, and coal, etc. The distance by which imports of various industrial raw materials exceed exports is too great, forcing Germany to adopt a new policy for international trade. We know that 60% of Germany's current international trade is directly controlled by the government, and 20% is operated by merchants recognized by the government. The only difficulty in Germany's ideal of economic self-sufficiency is the lack of raw materials. Of the fats needed nationwide, Germany only produces half of them itself, iron ore is less than 20%, wool and various cotton textile raw materials are less than 10%, soybeans, soybean cakes, vegetable oils, etc. are less than 4%, and cotton, hemp, jute, silk, rubber, rosin, and shellac, etc. are even less than 1%. In order to remedy the lack of various raw materials mentioned above, the German government is making every effort to promote the rapid realization of the following plans. The production of vegetable oil is being increased, and whaling is also being expanded. The production of cream has also increased. The cream production of the government-controlled cattle farms alone can be increased from 2,350 gallons to 3,700 gallons this year. In order to increase wool production, the number of sheep raised nationwide has increased from 3.5 million to 10 million. Mixed textile raw materials made from waste wool, like mixed rubber and mixed gasoline, have already been shipped. At the same time, the National Socialist Party is also urging people nationwide to forget their private interests and work hard for the country in order to promote the realization of the entire economic plan.</p>
<p>(5) Reduction of Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>An important policy of the National Socialist Party in domestic affairs is to reduce the number of unemployed people in the country, and this policy has already achieved considerable success. It is said that in July of this year, the number of unemployed people in Germany decreased by another 144,000, and as a result, the total number of unemployed people is only 1,170,000. The continuous decline in the number of unemployed people in Germany recently allows us to see that the numbers are almost the same as in the golden age of 1928 and 1929. Spokesmen for the National Socialist Party have already warned the business community that a shortage of workers will soon become a reality, so every factory should make full use of machinery in order to save labor. Because the number of new workers needed by each factory, taking toy painters alone, has exceeded the number of 400,000 people registered as unemployed. Indeed, since Hitler took power, the number of unemployed people has been reduced by six million, and we can find a lot of strong evidence. First, in May of this year, there were 17,550,000 people employed in Germany, which is more than 6,000,000 more than in January 1933. On the other hand, the number of unemployed people has also decreased by more than 1,000,000. If we compare this with 18,000,000 people employed in Germany as a whole in 1928, the peak era, the difference is not far off. Second, the extreme shortage of skilled workers in Germany today is a very obvious fact. Therefore, many factories are offering higher wages to poach such workers. Third, although the National Socialist Party advocates a general reduction in wages until the unemployment problem is completely resolved, the wages of ordinary workers are still increasing. Not long ago, one factory announced that it would give all its employees a general pay raise of 10%. In Germany, the forced labor of workers, the prohibition of freedom, and the state control of all economic products and employment are all interesting things. We know that there are currently 200,000 workers doing substitute work and receiving relief in Germany. All people who get part-time work only work 20 to 36 hours a week due to the lack of raw materials. On the other hand, National Socialists have told people that the unemployment problem has already been resolved. Among the number of unemployed people in Germany today, at least 500,000 are changing jobs, so their unemployment is temporary and they will soon get a job. There are also some who cannot work because they are sick physically or mentally. The latter, of course, should be included in social problems and require people's relief. According to what the German Labor Minister told people, from September 1 of this year, employers are not allowed to employ people who do not have a personal declaration when adding workers. Only those who are employed or have a skill that can be hired can obtain this certificate from the authorities. In this way, the employment and dismissal of workers in Germany will, of course, be more closely monitored by the government in the future.</p>

<h3>Securities: Situation Eases, Bond Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>From October 5th to October 10th of last week, the market conditions of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly. Sino-Japanese negotiations seemed to be in the final stage. Sangdao's arrival in China heightened the tense atmosphere. Tensions in Hongkou and Zhabei rose and fell from time to time. After Kawagoe met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the atmosphere eased, and all rumors in the market were nothing but speculations. Public debt was more sensitive to the environment, resulting in a restless atmosphere. Last week, on Monday, Sangdao arrived in Shanghai, and the psychology of buyers and sellers was contradictory. Market prices fluctuated, with most rising slightly by three to five cents, and some rising slightly better. On Tuesday, rumors of issuing circulation coupons suddenly appeared in the market, and the bullish trend was very strong. Although the closing price had fallen, it still rose by 35 cents to 1.35 yuan. Gold and Sichuan gangs bought a lot. On Wednesday, the news was complicated and tension appeared again on the surface. People's hearts were floating, and market prices fell sharply by several cents to 1.2 yuan. On Thursday, Kawagoe's meeting with Chiang Kai-shek was peaceful, and the risk was therefore reduced. Buyers were extremely enthusiastic, and many turned from short to long, and market prices rose sharply by 50 cents to 1 yuan. On Friday, people's hearts became confused again, resulting in a slight decrease of 10 cents to 45 cents. Last week, market prices changed very quickly. Types C, D, and E had broken through the 60 yuan mark three times, and the rest were still within the mark at the close. As a result, the market price of Type E rose by 90 cents, and the market price of Type A rose by 30 cents. The total transaction volume was 50,041,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yaerchang, Medical Doctor of Ben Shewen University, USA</p>
<h3>Early Arrival and Abnormality of Women's Menstruation</h3>
<p>...Sudden surge of menstruation before maturity is prone to weakness and neurological roots...Anemia, congenital insufficiency, and neurasthenia are the main causes of abnormal menstruation...If the husband finds that his wife has this disease, he should cure it quickly to avoid infertility</p>
<p>A healthy woman has normal menstruation, and feels no discomfort during menstruation, or only slight discomfort, and feels a little full in the pelvic area due to the accumulation of blood. There should be no weakness or exhaustion, and even a slight loss of normality should be included in menstrual disease.</p>
<p>Although menstrual diseases are usually regarded as symptoms of physical function, they are rooted in physical organization, or inherent difficulties in the condition of organs. If the whole body is not taken into account and only local treatment is performed, it cannot be a good method.</p>
<p>Early arrival of menstruation - menstruation sometimes comes suddenly before puberty, which is likely to make girls weak. The reason is that they develop too early, or because people in the environment or children playing with them induce them to pay attention to their performance early, or are taught to commit masturbation. Under these circumstances, her spring feelings are triggered too early. If she is not taken care of and restrained, this young girl may plant the root of weakness and nerve problems from this point on.</p>
<p>Abnormal menstruation - This phenomenon is almost universally suffered by women who have lost their health. If they have anemia and congenital insufficiency, they are also the causes of abnormal menstruation. Diseases of the digestive system, diabetes, and neurasthenia are also factors of abnormal menstruation. In short, once a woman's menstruation becomes abnormal, her health and happiness are also deprived. Because a healthy woman's menstruation will never change, if it suddenly increases, or is too rare, or even comes every two months, or several times a month, it is called abnormality and should be treated quickly, and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>If a husband finds that his wife has such a problem, he should pay close attention to it, and the wife should also tell her husband, and should not hide it, because it will not only damage her health, but will definitely suffer from infertility, which will make it difficult for future generations to have children, and the family will have no fun, and even the couple will turn against each other.</p>
<p>Regarding treatment, since Dr. Xiutainaha, a famous German gynecologist, advocated the application of gonadotropin preparations, women’s "Reproductive Su", scholars from all over the world have responded, because it is easy to take and the effect is reliable. This preparation is indeed good news for women. Taking only two or three boxes internally will immediately adjust menstruation, and you will feel refreshed, have good sleep, and your appearance, skin, and strength will be vigorous. This is indeed a good medicine that lives up to its name.</p>

<p>(1) The Only Salvation for Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Qin Huaihe, 19 years old, from Nanjing, complained - suffering from nocturnal emission for three years, recently more severe, so he is mentally exhausted, thin, insomnia often does not sleep all night, occasionally falls asleep, nocturnal emission appears, weak and powerless when getting up in the morning, limbs are weak, mentally distracted, has no intention of doing things, is currently studying at a Qianzhuang, and is often scolded because of this. Although he tries his best to calm down, he is always unable to do so, and he is in deep pain. Medical history - He committed the bad habit of masturbation at the age of 14. At the age of 16, he came to Shanghai to study, and occasionally read a newspaper detailing the harm of masturbation, which is no less than suicide. He was shocked and quit. Nocturnal emission followed, four or five times a month, recently suddenly increased to once a day, and often without dreams. He also leaks semen when defecating during the day. Current symptoms - The prostate is abnormal, and the semen gate has lost its ability to control. Treatment method - First, administer the special medicine for sperm consolidation "Himitoff's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to stop leakage and consolidate the semen gate, and then perform electrotherapy surgery. After three weeks of treatment, nocturnal emission is cured, and then "Reproductive Su" is administered to replenish the depleted sperm. After five weeks, he completely recovered his health, was full of energy, was competent at work, and slept comfortably. He has become a handsome young man.</p>
<p>(2) Radical Treatment for Excessive Lust</p>
<p>Patient Jia Hongliang, 32 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, complained - Ten years ago, he liked to go to brothels and had many mistresses. He indulged in lust at will. After two years, he already felt overwhelmed and his body gradually became profaned, but he still did not know how to examine himself and continued as before. After another three years, he planned to rein in, but he had already contracted a terrible disease, his blood was dry and his mind was weak, his face was yellow and his muscles were thin, his temples were gray, his eyes were dizzy and his ears were ringing, his back was curved and his waist was sore, and he was aging everywhere. He couldn't help but be shocked. Occasionally engaging in sexual activity, he was even more weak and incompetent. Medical history - He indulged in lust for five years. He also had a new injury from masturbation in his childhood, so he is only in his thirties now, but he is as old as an old man, and his decline is unbearable. Please treat him. Current symptoms - The reproductive glands have aged and lost the vitality of nourishment, and the sexual nerves are even more wilted and paralyzed. Treatment method - Administer a large amount of the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Su" to promote the health of the reproductive glands, reproduce fresh cells, and enhance the nourishment of endocrine. At the same time, perform electrotherapy surgery to stimulate the sexual nerves to restore their original function. After two months of careful treatment, this patient who was about to become consumptive was able to regain his health, and his complexion was rosy and his energy was exuberant, restoring the appearance of his prime.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Ms. Huang Bingji from Sima Lane in Kaifeng City, Henan Province, wrote: I have been suffering from leukorrhea for many years, which is extremely disgusting, but I also suffer from a lack of self-treatment medicine. Last month, I happened to go to a classmate's house, and she entrusted me to use "Therapeutic Band" and take "Female Reproductive Su" internally. On the way home, I bought three boxes of each and used them internally and externally according to the law. Now, the leukorrhea is completely gone, and my body has also been strengthened.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain Cured</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Bingzhi from Xinchanghao, Dongda Street, Liyang, wrote: I suffered from unbearable stomach pain. I have tried several treatments, but none have been effective. "Stomach Pain Healing Spirit" and "Stomach Health Su", two bottles each, were taken, and the pain stopped immediately. The effect was unmatched. It has not recurred for half a year, and my appetite has increased greatly, and my body has also gained weight.</p>
<p>Difficulty Having Children</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xincheng from the French Concession in Tianjin wrote: I masturbated too much in my childhood, and also suffered from congenital insufficiency, resulting in weak sexual power. Five years after marriage, I have not had children. This spring, I came to Shanghai and was carefully treated by Dr. Zhan Nianzeng, and the foreskin was removed. I took "Reproductive Su" internally, and I was able to develop fully, and my kidneys were strong. My wife is already four months pregnant.</p>
<p>Fake Medicine Harms People</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Si from Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, wrote: I squandered too much in my early years, and my body was therefore extremely depleted. Later, I immediately examined myself and focused on treatment. At the beginning of summer, I bought three boxes of "Reproductive Su", and found that it was packed in paper boxes and bottles. After taking it, it had no effect. I realized that it was a fake medicine, so I bought four boxes of genuine "Reproductive Su" in iron boxes, and the impotence and premature ejaculation I suffered were swept away. And my weight increased, and my spirit was sufficient. It was indeed the grace of the genuine iron box "Reproductive Su" to recreate me.</p>
<p>Low Breast Height</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Bi from Jiaxing wrote: My breast height was abnormally shriveled due to incomplete development, and my body had felt weak. Then, after being introduced by my classmate Ms. Peng to take female "Reproductive Su", the situation was very different. Not only did my breast height rise, but my body was also strengthened.</p>
<p>Popular Medicine</p>
<h3>Prevention of Early Aging</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>……Both physical and mental well-being must be attended to……The efforts of physiologists have finally achieved success.</p>
<p>Before delving into this problem, it is necessary to elaborate on the gonads, which govern human health, because permanent vitality and premature aging are purely due to the health and decline of the gonads. The reason is that the germ cells within the human body are located within the gonads. If the gonads are vigorous, the germ cells are nourished, flourishing, and at the same time, metabolic functions are promoted, and bones, muscles, skin, hair, brainpower, and spirit also exhibit extraordinary vitality. Conversely, they exhibit withering and haggard phenomena, which is what is called premature aging.</p>
<p>Why do the gonads weaken? This is undoubtedly due to ignorance of health preservation. For example, masturbation in early years, excessive sexual activity after marriage, and a romantic nature leading to infection with gonorrhea are all fatal injuries to the vigor of the gonads. In addition, disharmony after illness and congenital weakness are also major causes of premature aging. In 1923, after the famous French physiologist Dr. Briese first cured a woman with early aging using a gonadal hormone preparation, European and American scholars unanimously utilized it. Recently, the "Gonadin" of the Austrian physiologist Steinach has been greatly praised by famous doctors in various countries, because the "Gonadin" invented by Steinach is a hundred times more advanced than the gonadal hormone preparation used by the French Briese in 1923. It can not only turn the aging of the body into rosy complexion, but also eliminate the aging of the spirit at the same time. Therefore, the spirit is strong, the brainpower is sufficient, and the thinking is active, which can prevent diseases from invading and prolong life. It also has the same effect on women. Therefore, European and American women often use this female preparation to restore their lost youth. No wonder young women unanimously regard it as a wonderful elixir for preserving beauty.</p>
<p>Tips for Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>Why Hesitate for Those Who Failed to Quit Smoking?</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiao-han</p>
<p>Quickly Try Supplementing to Quit Smoking - A Shortcut to Happiness for You</p>
<p>The reason why quitting smoking could not be achieved in the past was actually because there was no perfect remedy, so most people were skeptical and did not move forward, which is indeed the case. Imagine a person who is physically exhausted and completely relies on the strength of tobacco to maintain his life. If there is no tonic that surpasses the power of tobacco to strengthen the body, how is it possible to quit? However, according to medical theory, the reason why smokers' bodies are weaker than ordinary people and why tobacco is needed to boost their spirits is because the life source of the smoker's body, the gonads, has been damaged by tobacco toxins, preventing it from having metabolic effects, disrupting internal secretions, and completely eliminating its original resistance. If there is no powerful special medicine to generate antitoxins and restore the health of the gonads, it is indeed difficult to quit as desired.</p>
<p>The Austrian physiologist Steinach invented a method of supplementing to quit smoking based on this medical theory, which is like creating a fresh force to attack tobacco toxins. This method uses the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin" to supplement and restore the original healthy gonads, invigorate its internal secretions, prosper its fresh cells, and promote powerful antitoxins. At the same time, if "Yuwei Ci Baoming" is injected again, it will have a faster effect, unfailingly successful in hundreds of attempts, and universally effective. This summer, Mr. Shen Qinglong asked me to help him quit smoking. He had tried to quit three times, but because the pain was unbearable, he had no effect at all, so he planned to grow old as a smoker. However, recently the prohibition order has been strict, so he had to quit. Later, I used the supplementing method to quit smoking, giving him a large amount of genuine "Gonadin" in iron boxes, and he safely quit in two months, and his body also became stronger, beyond his expectations.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Bone Pain</p>
<h3>The Most Advanced Treatment for Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhi-zhong</p>
<p>Those with Weak Constitutions are Particularly Susceptible - Those with Excessive Indulgence Cannot Avoid This Condition</p>
<p>Regarding the condition of bone pain, those with weak constitutions and those with excessive indulgence are prone to suffer from it. It is more serious and rampant in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. In addition, it also has a special relationship with the seasons. Patients often feel lighter pain at ordinary times, but when the seasons change or the weather is overcast, the disease becomes exceptionally severe. Patients who have been troubled by bone pain for a long time can feel it! It is unanimously considered a difficult to treat symptom. However, if patients can rely on the most advanced treatment and try taking "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets", it can show its effectiveness within a few hours—bone joints are relaxed, the waist and back are comfortable, and the spirit is instantly vigorous. Bone pain experts all over the world do not deny it, and all admire the greatness of Johnson's invention in the United States. In my hundred trials, I have completely cured ninety-two people, and the symptoms of everyone else have been alleviated. Therefore, I deeply believe in the efficacy of this medicine. Patient Xu Zifu, when he was young, was addicted to sexual pleasure and suffered from venereal disease, so his blood became turbid and he suffered from bone pain. For twenty years, he had attacks whenever the seasons changed and pain whenever the weather was overcast. Treatment was ineffective. Later, I used "Johnson's Bone Pain Tablets" for three bottles and he was cured. He has not had an attack in three years.</p>
<h3>Treatment of Small Genitals and Impotence and Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Junshi, Doctor of Medicine, Germany</p>
<p>……This condition is more often acquired than congenital, with masturbation and gonorrhea being the main causes……Recently, famous European and American specialists have adopted the fundamental treatment of the gonads……Abroad, Jewish businessmen suffer from this disease the most, and there are many people in our country who suffer from it.</p>
<p>Originally, the genitals of men and women develop rapidly when spring love is activated, that is, at the age of fifteen or sixteen, which is a general phenomenon. However, there are also those who still do not develop even when they reach adulthood, and remain extremely small.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, it can be said from two aspects: First, one's own genitals are not small, but one suffers from neurasthenia and only feels as if they are small, and is therefore very pessimistic. Second, it is indeed underdeveloped, even like a child.</p>
<p>What is the reason for underdevelopment? This is because: During adolescence, there are problems with endocrine of the gonads; therefore, although there are times when sexual development is hindered, such congenital small patients are always in the minority, and most are still acquired.</p>
<p>The so-called acquired genital hypoplasia is in adolescence; because of unnatural masturbation and excessive sexual activity during the honeymoon, or because of malignant gonorrhea, the prostate gland is abnormally stimulated. As a result, the testicles and other endocrine functions become poor, often leading to spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and decreased or inability to erect. Then, it becomes impotence and smallness, and falls into sexual neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Many people suffering from this disease, because it is combined with neurasthenia, are dominated by extreme pessimism, terror, insomnia, distracting thoughts, and compulsive thoughts, and despair of the future, which makes the disease even more severe. However, no matter what, although this disease is called difficult to treat, it is by no means incurable.</p>
<p>Recently, famous European and American specialists have adopted the following three treatments: (1) Underdevelopment, premature ejaculation, impotence and all sexual neurasthenia, etc., are treated with the genuine gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadin". (2) For nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea and slippery sperm, use "Hemitol's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate spermatorrhea. (3) If there is malignant gonorrhea, then use the "Anti-Gon" made of yellow pigment and vaccine, so its efficacy is significant and there are no side effects. In the past, general doctors mostly used induction current and manual current for this disease. According to my experience, although electrotherapy is also useful, it cannot be used as the main treatment. Why? Because: electrical treatment is only on the surface and does not go beyond the effect of massage. However, this disease is caused by the weakness of the gonads, so a thorough and fundamental treatment must be used, with "Gonadin" as the main treatment, so the efficacy is lasting and obvious. I have cured more than 7,000 patients in Germany for more than ten years, most of whom are Jewish, and after returning to China, the total has exceeded 10,000, which is indeed a good medicine for the symptoms.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Self-Treatment</p>
<h3>The Most Economical and Reliable Treatment for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Infection with gonorrhea by those who like to go whoring has become an unavoidable fact. Therefore, after having improper sexual intercourse, we should perform the following simple test: take a clean, transparent glass and directly take your own urine; observe it quietly, even if there is no pus in the urine, if there are slightly transparent flocculent pieces floating on top, that is evidence that you have been infected with gonorrhea, and you should quickly take internally the "Anti-Gon", a combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine invented by the famous German medical doctor Jette Sen. This excellent special medicine for leukorrhea is not only very quick to cure, but also removes the root forever and leaves no future troubles.</p>
<p>In countries with advanced medicine, such as Germany, Italy, Austria, England, France, and the United States, the combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine "Anti-Gon" is used to reduce hundreds of thousands of sufferers from gonorrhea every year, and the effect is reliable, and it is in line with the principle of simplicity, efficiency, and economy, so the benefits for the physical and mental health of patients are great.</p>
<p>In general, patients who seek medical treatment have already found pus discharge and subjective symptoms in eight or nine out of ten cases; therefore, it is a pity that they cannot be cured in a short period of time! Now patients can use this great and reliable "Anti-Gon" to achieve the effect of short-term cure, and because the drug's power can penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, and can also increase the body's resistance to bacterial vaccines, it is always beneficial for acute and chronic and all complications. Gonorrhea is truly a terrible disease! However, if patients treat themselves according to the above method, I am afraid it will not take a week to completely eradicate it. In recent years, I have used this agent to completely cure more than tens of thousands of patients without failure. Therefore, I dare to recommend it.</p>

<h3>New Gadgets of Londoners</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>"Go to nature!" This slogan was once popular in Europe and America, guiding many curious men and women to practice nude sports. In fact, to go to nature, it is not enough to just take off your clothes. It is necessary to restore everything to primitive life to be thorough. According to recent news reports: A strange group was discovered in Laxden, near London, advocating "Return me to nature". This group has a total of twenty-eight people, who farm and feed themselves, live separately in wooden huts, burn candles at night, their food is limited to wild vegetables and fruits, their clothes are limited to cotton cloth and kapok, they work at sunrise and rest at sunset, living an extremely simple life. According to a member, "We are neither communists nor eccentrics. Modern civilized life is too unnatural, and there are too many artificial hypocrisies. Therefore, we run this primitive life to return me to nature." This cannot but be said to be a new gadget.</p>
<p>Modern civilized life does have many defects that make people feel annoyed. What are the defects of modern civilized life? Everyone who lives in modern civilized society, especially those who live in cities, can experience it. "Too unnatural, too many artificial hypocrisies" is an obvious fact. Therefore, some people who cannot bear the suffering go to nature together. Like the strange group in Laxden, unwilling to be dominated by modern civilized life, they jointly run a primitive and simple life of "working at sunrise and resting at sunset" in the suburbs to achieve their ideal of "returning me to nature". This fully illustrates the bankruptcy of modern civilized life!</p>
<p>However, the trend of the times is moving forward. Since society has evolved from ancient times to modern times, human life should change with the times to be the way to survive. To go against the trend and turn back the clock is not only not allowed by the facts, but also foolishly ridiculous. For example, when Europeans and Americans shout "Go to nature!" they are only temporarily tired of civilized life and want to change their taste and try natural life. They may not really have the intention of enjoying primitive life for a long time. The group near London that advocates "Return me to nature" is the same reason.</p>
<p>In fact, true civilized life is precious, and hypocritical civilized life is what people curse! And modern civilized life is the latter rather than the former, so it reveals many defects. But if we want to improve life, the right way is to overthrow hypocritical civilization and create true civilization. It is unreasonable to return to primitive life. Because modern civilized life is not satisfactory to us, primitive life is even more unwelcome to us. "Go to nature!" This is probably just a fashionable slogan.</p>
<h3>Riding a Horse to School (Continued)</h3>
<p>When everyone was at a loss like wooden chickens, my cousin came to an agreement with a groom, and the five of us were helped out of the encirclement by him. The other unsuccessful companions united and used the most vulgar and unpleasant words to scold the groom's mother, sisters, and even great-grandmother for seventeen or eight generations.</p>
<p>The groom was unusually happy. He led us to run in front to lead his horses, and still cursed in his mouth, "Your mother is old, into your sister!"</p>
<p>But one of those companions jumped onto a stone pier and asked like a leader?</p>
<p>"Into whose sister?"</p>
<p>"Into Ma A-da's sister!" a united answer.</p>
<p>The vulgar laughter was about to shatter this wilderness.</p>
<p>Ma A-da seemed to yield, and led five horses over, let us get on the horses, and silently withdrew his legs and followed behind. He may still be very proud of calculating to go home tonight to buy a bottle of wine and drink to his heart's content.</p>
<p>Running past the Confucius Temple, there were indeed two soldiers with guns standing in front of the door. So we, led by my cousin on one horse, went to the school. The school was the place where the Qing soldiers used to practice, and it was also the execution ground for killing criminals, but now there were neither soldiers practicing nor criminals shouting "Twenty years later, I will be a good man again"! Facing a large grassland that could not be seen to the edge, the five horses stood neatly side by side, exchanged a look, and ran back the road. Everyone didn't open their mouths on horseback. They were probably too disappointed by the disappointment given to them by the scenic area.</p>
<p>Running past the place where the horses were released, the groom of the leader shouted again;</p>
<p>"Into whose sister?"</p>
<p>Naturally, it was again united, "Into Ma A-da's sister!"</p>
<p>I heard Ma A-da curse "Shameless"!</p>
<p>We got off our horses at the Shuizha Bridge, because horses were not allowed in the city. My cousin gave Ma A-da a dollar</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>He thanked him profusely and led the horse away.</p>
<p>I expected that he would still be subjected to a united insult from his companions when he went back.</p>
<h3>To Sheshan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>(Special Feature by this Newspaper) Sheshan is one of the Nine Peaks of Jiangnan, twelve miles away from Songjiang. There is a Catholic church on the mountain. Every May, the church holds a grand ceremony to welcome the Virgin Mary. Catholics from far and near must go to the mountain to pray. However, the only way to go to Sheshan is by water, and it takes six more miles by boat, which is not very convenient to go back and forth. After the Song-Si Road (Songjiang to Sijing) was opened by the owner of the Songhu long-distance bus, Mr. Yin Shisheng, he opened a branch road from Zhuanqiao Station directly to Sheshan, which was opened to traffic on Double Tenth Day, and invited the Shanghai press to visit.</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. that morning, a special car was waiting at the Hu-Min long-distance bus station. Although the reporter went to bed very late the night before, he was very happy to get up early, because he lived in the city all year round, and it was an opportunity to travel to the countryside once, directly to Sheshan. Along the way, in the fields, the heavy ears of rice were fluttering in the wind, and a good harvest was expected. The faces of the villagers were mostly hung with rare smiles, hoping that those rice merchants would do good deeds and not deliberately manipulate the market when the new rice came on the market.—</p>
<p>A colored archway was tied at the station, surrounded by many idle villagers watching. We got off the bus and went to the reception room in the aisle of people—it was a newly built flat house along both sides of the station, with one or two dozen rooms on each side, all of which were planned to be shops in the future. The priests from the mountain and the press from Songjiang and other places had arrived before us. As soon as we were seated, the director greeted us for lunch. Although the dishes were very rich, we were indeed hungry, and we also wanted more time to play, so we all ate in a hurry. When we come to Sheshan, of course we have to visit the mountain once. There is still one or two miles from the station to the foot of the mountain. There are small boats at the station specially for tourists to travel on the river. We occupied one and rowed towards Sheshan. In a few minutes, we arrived at the front mountain gate. Up is a sandy road, with thousands of bamboos on both sides, like the path from Lingyin Temple to Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou. When we arrived in Zhongshan, it was the church, and in front of it was a cement-paved square. A priest who guided us had already gone up the mountain to contact the observatory for a visit. We only stood there for a while and went forward again. There are two roads to go from there to the top of the mountain, one is a zigzag type, which is very flat; the other is stone steps straight up, but you can take many fewer steps. We took the zigzag road. At every corner of the road, there was a shrine of the Way of Suffering, a total of ten, symbolizing the suffering of Jesus. The highest one was the Shrine of the Cross.</p>
<p>The observatory is at the peak of the mountain, built in the shape of a fort. The huge telescope placed on the beam is like an anti-aircraft gun. The priest who guided us explained to us in his stiff local language with his 35 years of achievements in Songjiang:</p>
<p>"For example, if you want to take a picture of a star far away in the sky," he pointed the telescope at the sky and turned a pair of chairs placed on the shelf below the mirror, indicating that people have to sit on the chairs to watch, "But, to see the sun, you can't see it like this, because the sunlight is extremely strong and will damage your eyes." He felt that the conversation was going too far, and immediately said that to take a picture of a star far away in the sky, it would take at least three hours, but the planet is moving—that is, according to ordinary people, the earth is actually moving, and when taking pictures, you have to rotate the turret-shaped roof. He turned a button for us to see and explained: "We have a watch that calculates the speed of its movement, and uses electricity to slowly rotate the roof to follow it, so that the planet can be photographed."</p>
<p>Although there was no practical test, his explanation and performance satisfied us.</p>
<p>We came out to the cathedral at the top of the mountain. It is said that the church was built for five years and is very magnificent, like what we saw in foreign movies. After climbing the mountain and visiting many places, we felt very tired at that time, so we stood in front of the hall and looked around. The fields, trees, and houses were densely arranged: looking into the distance of the sky, a friend imitated Zhou Chong's tone in "Thunderstorm":</p>
<p>"There are three white clouds over there... Let's float a small boat and fly, fly, fly, fly to that world, that happy world!"</p>
<p>Although that is an illusion to get rid of the troubles of the world, in that kind of realm, there is indeed a feeling of detachment from the world.</p>
<p>When we went down the mountain, we took the stone steps road, found the boat that had been rowed to the mountain gate, and floated in the small river to restore our tired spirits. The sun had already set in the west, and the evening breeze was blowing our shirts, floating, floating, and we almost wanted to fall asleep, but the 4:30 bus was about to leave, so we got on the bus with regret.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that the owner had actively planned to build a hostel for the convenience of tourists, and it would be another scene to tour the mountain at night or boat on the moonlit night. This wish should be expected in the future, but who can book things for tomorrow?</p>

<p>New Fisherman's Song</p>
<p>Along the coast for 30 million miles. Which country can compare? Definitely. Territorial waters and fishing areas. With 270,000 nautical miles. Sigh our country's rights. Rights. Rights. Are being taken away. Enemy fishing boats. Swim to the east. Swim to the west. How can this be? The livelihood of our country's fishermen. Livelihood. Utterly destroyed. Leaving only the broken nets left by Grandpa. Turned into useless things. Before long, the descendants will leave a broken boat. Just like sinking to the bottom. Along the coast for 30 million miles. Which country has a coastline of 30 million nautical miles? The Republic of China has a coastline of 30 million nautical miles. There are 270,000 large-area bathing areas. 1.5 million fishermen. Hard work and heavy taxes. Relying entirely on the sea for a living. Enemy countries invade at will. Trawlers and fishing boats are very clever. A total of 240 ships. Even hand-operated nets are better than ours. Tens of thousands of yuan worth of business. The hot-selling market is not light. Along the coast for 30 million miles. Which country has a coastline of 30 million nautical miles? The Republic of China has a coastline of 30 million nautical miles. We unconditionally give up. The fishermen are in pain all their lives. Giving their lives to the sea. Too ignorant. How can we endure foreign insults again? Suffering to the point where our stomachs are empty. And we are about to be cut off from our livelihood. Livelihood. Always poor. Always poor. Wake up quickly. Wake up quickly. Everyone together. Unite and succeed. Move forward. Move forward. Millions of people are of one mind. Hoping that the government will negotiate and not let go. Try our best to teach a large plan to succeed. Along the coast for 30 million miles. Which country has a coastline of 30 million nautical miles? The Republic of China has a coastline of 30 million nautical miles. There are 270,000 large-area fishing areas. Sigh our country's national strength is too low. Territorial waters are being bullied. It is hateful that enemy countries invade and profit. Swim to the east and swim to the west. There is no justice, no reason. Our country's fishermen are in great danger. Our country's fishermen are cut off from their livelihood. Livelihood is cut off and they are poor to the end. There is nothing left. The broken nets left by Grandpa. All turned into waste things. Before long. The broken boats that everyone can't walk on. Just like sinking to the bottom. To the end.</p>

In order to escape a deep panic, the imperialists are so crazy. Since occupying our north, they have also attacked our Yangtze River. (Now they want to seize our east and west,) as</p>

<p>Opening "Jia Baoyu's Night Visit to Xiaoxiang Pavilion"</p>
<p>Bitter winter frost hardens into ice. The moonlight is dim, the soul almost broken. Gusts of north wind penetrate the bones. The pitch-black Grand View Garden is deserted. Baoyu walks along the flower-lined path. The night is late and quiet, no sound is heard. He is a lamp, a person. Dark shadows flicker as he walks forward, alone to Xiaoxiang Pavilion, to see if his sister Lin's illness has lessened. He gently knocks the copper ring, it drips and sounds. Is there someone who will quickly come to open the door? Zijuan listens and asks, "Is it Master Bao?" Wanting to go inside. She quickly opens the door. "Please be careful, the cold of the deep night is unforgiving. Thank you, sister, for your heartfelt concern. I can never forget your great kindness. I am only worried about our Miss Lin, so I have come in the deep of night." Walking, he arrives at the bedside, seeing her gasping for breath. One is called "Sister Lin," one calls "Cousin." Her almond eyes barely open, unable to see clearly. "Cousin, your second sister-in-law is too harsh on me. She speaks absurdly and creates trouble. Although the Old Ancestor loves me, I am sorry, I cannot go to pay my respects. You and I, the karma of the past life is now being repaid. Please don't look at this ill-fated person anymore." Sister, cast aside all your worries. Don't think too little of yourself. I advise you to eat three meals a day and wear more clothes to keep warm. I advise you to go to bed early and not too late at night. Drink more medicine and supplements. I advise you not to listen to the words of the sisters. They are like falsehood, like a drama, and like chastity. I advise you to take care of your body and protect your heart. Do not think of the old family home in Yangzhou. Hearing these words, tears fall like rain. "My enemy, I have been hurting for so long. Cousin, return to Yihong Courtyard early in the morning. Tears have soaked through my silk handkerchief. This body may not be too drifting."</p>

<p>Yuanchang (1120) 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Withered"</p>
<p>The drizzling rain is a withered sky. Silian thinks of spring and moves, worried and sleepless. The orioles have turned past, the peach and willow blossoms have faded. Early summer mornings are annoying. The beauty, returning to her hometown early, has morning joy and evening music like a fairy. Most hateful, the husband has been gone for two years without a word. Looking back on the future, it is truly pitiful. Could it be that he met a courtesan in a foreign land and his intentions have changed in that gentle land? Causing me to not think of tea or rice for three meals a day. Daytimes are long, and nighttime is difficult to fall asleep. Causing me to have no heart to do things during the day. At night, I keep half a bed to myself. Causing me, a bright moon hangs in the sky. A lonely goose shadow is in front of the window. Causing me to have wild thoughts and my mind to collapse, finally falling ill and lying in bed for half a year. Fortunately, the divine doctor performed a holy surgery, and my body safely returned to health. Thinking back to the beginning, a pair of beautiful eyes were as black as bird pearls, and her face was like a lotus flower, an oval face. Thinking back to the beginning, her appearance was beautiful. Now, her face is sallow and skinny in the mirror. Thinking back to the beginning, her figure was slender, healthy, and the curves were beautiful. Now, she is thin and bony, unable to move. Thinking of endless sad places, tears fall like rain on her chest. Her withered appearance is pitiable.</p>

<h3>Odds and Ends from Huaan</h3>
<p>The entire crew of the "Wolf Mountain Bloodshed Record" location shooting team in Suzhou has returned to Shanghai a few days ago and has achieved great results. It is said that due to the needs of the play, a wolf and dozens of hounds were killed.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu's new work, "Peaceful World," is a new type of comedy. The script has been approved by the drama committee and is now in intensive scene development.

<p>Sun Yu will use his power to write and direct his new work "A Match Made in Heaven" which has already started filming. The wooden chair used by Han Lanji in the play is strangely shaped and is a rare treasure that is rarely seen in the world and is of extraordinary value.</p>
<p>Lianhua Pictorial will resume publication this month, and the first issue of its resumption will be the "慈母曲" Guide issue.</p>
<h3>Liang Saizhu Returns to the Silver Screen</h3>

<h3>Anecdotes of "Beside the Huangpu River"</h3>
<p>Tao Jin and Leng Bo play rickshaw pullers in "Beside the Huangpu River". They did not cut their hair or trim their sideburns for more than a month during filming, and their colleagues called them "long-haired".</p>
<p>A shot of a small beggar eating watermelon was filmed sixteen times at the Huangpu Wharf, breaking the record for NG shots in this film.</p>
<p>When Chen Qixia was filming her business of shaking a paddle at the Huangpu Wharf, the camerman was afraid that people would look into the camera and hid the camera in the car. The police did not know that it was filming and stepped forward to interfere with Chen Qixia. It was only after an explanation that there was no problem. Tao Jin has several sensual shots in "Beside the Huangpu River".</p>
<p>Tang Jie plays a wife-fearing character in the film, which can be said to be perfectly portrayed.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhong plays an accountant in the play, who is a friend who specializes in eating tofu.</p>
<p>When Chen Qixia Tan plays copper in the drama, Chen Jingfang sings "Zhaojun's Lament" and Chen Qixia plays the piano for her.</p>
<p>When Shen Nanshi was filming the scenery of Huangpu River, he often placed the camera in the middle of the road. The patrolmen repeatedly warned him for obstructing traffic. Shen ignored him, considering himself a tough guy.</p>
<p>The sound engineer, Wei He, put a lot of effort into the sound effects in this film, such as the crowing of chickens, the barking of dogs, and the sounds of stupid birds.</p>
