<h3 id="c13">最近遠東局勢的推移 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>最近遠東國際局勢表面上雖保持着「安定」「平和」的狀態可是實際上却埋伏着許多極大的危機極複雜的利害矛盾關係我們把這些關係綜合地分析起來的可分成下列幾方面第一方面是廣田東亞積極自主外交的推動中日「開誠佈公」的外交談話的進行日本駐華軍隊的提早擴充第二方面是「赤禍」向華北的進出史達林氏關於遠東問題的强硬而露骨態度的表示第三方面是英國最近在華南的活動英美在「東方孔道」的新加坡軍港合力防守以圖對日的策劃（據美國蒙特利奧公報所發表）因爲這三方面的形勢目前都在發展着所以整個遠東國際關係也顯現出充分的潛在的活躍形勢來</p>
<p>自二·二六政變以來日本對華外交的更趨積極更趨强硬已是很明顯的事實磯谷武官的奔走平津濟南有田大使的連日和我外交當局進行談話其任務如何內容如何我們雖未詳悉可是我們單看廣田兼外相本月十日所宣佈的對華政策在「力促三原則的具體化而完成中日間之完全的提携以資確立中日「滿」三國集團且使蒙古脫離赤化危險並爲確保中日「滿」三國的民族生存權計將强化其大陸政策」的一段話不難窺見日本今後對華政策的骨幹</p>
<p>日本對華政策的步步逼緊使東亞的門戶更有完全鎖閉的危機使東亞獨占的基礎更來得鞏固西方各國爲了遠東的利益誠如遠東問題的權威作家裴佛爾所指出只有三種辦法　進取　退讓　向前試探照目前的趨勢看來英美諾國是决計走最後一條路的英內閣國防白皮書的提出新加玻和香港軍事根據地的充實美國國會的大軍事預算案的通過參院外委會主席畢德門的痛斥日本以及最近英俄關係接近的趨向都是朝着反東亞獨佔的路上走</p>
<p>日蘇關係最近雖因兩國調査委員會的設立國界劃定問題的進行談判蘇俄遠東駐軍撤退問題的表示讓步而有緩和的趨勢但是我們决不能把華北赤禍和日蘇關係分開來看實質地說日本對華的獨佔政策强化一層則日蘇的關係自必緊張一層即使蒙僞沒有邊境的衡突漁業問題樺太島問題一一如日本所希望的完全解决日蘇關係難道有根本緩和的可能嗎所以我們的觀測正和日本完全相反我們以爲「赤禍」的勢力與日本的對華獨佔勢力是成正比例地加增的。</p>
<p>總之目前的遠東國際關係顯然地正走上這很重要的一個階段一方面日蘇在遠東大陸的對立形態更趨緊張而另一方面日本獨佔控制的加緊更加强英美諸國在華的活動在這一種形勢之下中國的應付方策自必戚到困難當然外交關係是應該充分利用的然而民族的獨立生存與主權的完整究比任何都來得重要國人對此表面平靜而內層極活躍的遠東情勢應該多多認識嚴密注意才好</p>

<h3 id="c88">識字運動的重要和推行（上）　敎育部科長 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾靈秀</p>
<p>識字的重要</p>
<p>一個國家的强弱，和牠的民族知識的高低，是成一個正比例的；明白的說，就是一個强盛的國家，他的民族知識高，衰弱的國家，他的民族知識低。所以民族知識的高低和國家的强弱，是有密切關係的。我們看看世界上各强國如美·英·法·意·德·俄·日本，其民族知識很高，而他們的國家也就非常强盛，這是一個很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>但是我們知道要提高民族知識，必須提倡認識求得知識工具的文字，因爲識字是求得知識的工具，要得到知識，必須識字，不識字，就不能得到知識。所以世界上各强國，對於「識字運動」非常注意，識字的人也非常之多，差不多沒有一個人不讀書，沒有一個人不識字就拿德國來說，一百個人當中有九十丸個認識字的，不認識字的不過一人。所以歐洲大戰以後，雖然慘敗，到現在不過十幾年工夫，又復輿起來了。此外如法國，英國，美國，日本，認識字的人都在百分之九十以上，不識字的不過百分之一二或三四。就是敎育較爲落後的俄國，幾年以前，不識字的文盲，尙有百分之七十。自第一次五年計劃成功後，努力識字運動的結果，不識字的不過百分之十，識字的已達百分之九十以上了。尙有百分之十的文盲，第二决五年計劃之第一年度內，（一九三三年）一　肅淸。現在想已做到了。世界各國之所以注意提倡識字運動，其目的無非是提高民智，健全國民，充實國力，强盛國家。</p>
<p>我們中國號稱東亞大國，得天惠獨厚，有四千餘年的文化，有四百萬方里的土地，有四萬萬以上的人口，而不識字的人，占百分之八十以上，的有三萬萬，占四分之三，以致民族智識低下，國力不充，國勢衰弱。近百年來，舉凡國際間和其他民族的交涉，無往而不失敗。失地賠欵以外，復簽訂種種不平等條的，淪於次殖民地的地位。自「九一八」以後，東四省又以不抵抗斷送了。我們想想，爲甚麼，會弄到這步田地呢？就是大多數人不識字：人民知識低下。雖有四萬萬的民衆，實無異一片散沙，團結不堅，精神渙散。反不如人口稀少者之有知識，有團結，有訓練，所以能够奮發有爲，以少勝多。現在我們要振起民族精神，提高民族知識，以圖挽救危亡，復興民族，就要提倡識字運動，提高民衆知識。這是識字和不識字的民族關係國家整個民族之利害如此其著。再就個人關係來談，不識字人的痛苦，眞是一言難盡。茲略舉幾個例子來說明：　比方不識字的人，不識　名和門牌號數，便不知東西和南北，這是多麽不便。　他到了危險的地方，就是有紙條貼在上面，明明寫着，「下有虎阱，行人莫近」或者是「謹防觸電」等類，但是他有眼睛而不認識字，還是走近去，免不了危險，這是多麽可怕。　藥水瓶外面，明明寫着「只能外用，不能內服，」他因爲不識字，仍然弄錯了，吃錯了，這是多麽危險。　遇着要緊的事，要同人家通信，不識字的人，有手不會寫字，勢必請求別人，這是多麽可憐。請人寫信，不能盡如己意，還是小事，緊要的私事都被人家知道了。這是多麼不方便。　使用鈔票，不識字人常被人家以一元鈔票當作五元十元鈔票算數，受人愚弄，不知不覺，這是多麽損失。古語說得好：「不識字，受盡氣，」眞是一點不錯啦！如此說來，個人不識字的痛苦，和整個國家大多數民衆不識字的利害，影響國家的强弱，關係已如此密切，可見識字的重要，和識字運動意義的重大了。</p>
<p>二，識字運動推行經過</p>
<p>國民政府兼都南京後，對於識字運動，深切注意。所以在十七年六月四日，中央常會通過的民衆訓練中，就把「厲行識字」列爲專條。至十月二十五日中央第一百七十九决常會决議下層工作綱領，「識字運動」更居七項之首，並制定識字運動宣傳綱要。十八年二月十三日敎育部頒布識字運動宣傳計劃大綱。令全國各省市一律於最短期內，舉行大規模的宣傳，以期唤起民衆對於識字讀書的求知興趣。自這項「宣傳計劃大綱」頒布以後，識字運動的聲浪，震動全國，識字運動的成績，也斐然可視。各省市遵照敎育部頒布的識字運動宣傳計劃大綱組織識字運動宣傳委員會的計有：江蘇·浙江·安徽·江西·湖北·湖南·福建·雲南·山西·河南·河北·山東·廣東·廣西·貴州·吉林·熱河·察哈爾·甘肅·陝西。寗夏·綏遠·等省，和南京·上海·靑島·北平·天津等市。各縣市組織成立者計近千餘。就中以江蘇·浙江·南京·上海四省市辦理較爲完善，而成績亦最著，各省市舉行識字運動宣傳後，所得的效果，的計如下：（一），添設民衆學校，識字學校，不識字民衆踴躍入學。（二）添設民衆問字處和民衆閱報處。（三）添設民衆識字牌·閱報牌·壁報。（四）增加推廣識字經費。（五）不識字人數逐漸减少。以上各項，允以各省市民衆學校數目增加甚多，歷年以來，均有進展，實在是識字運動最根本的辦法，也是一種很好的現象。據敎育部十七年度統計，十七年全國民衆學校總數爲六千七百零八校，學生二十萬六千零二十一人。十八年度爲二萬二千三百八十三校，學生八十八萬七千六百四十二人，較之十七年度增加二萬二千零六十二校，的增四倍有餘，學生增六十九高三千零三十九人，的增三倍半。十九年度爲二萬九千三百零二校，學生九十四萬四千二百八十九人，較之十八年度叉增加三千九百二十九校，增學生十四萬六千七百七十六人。二十年度爲三萬一千二百九十三校，學生一百零六萬二千一百六十一人，較之十九年度叉增加四千三百一十八校，增學生十一萬七千八百餘人。二十一年度爲三萬四千一百四十一校，學生爲一百一十萬九千八百五十七人，較之二十年度增加二千八百四十一校，增學生四萬七千七百一十四人。二十二年度爲三萬六千九百二十九校，學生一百二十九萬二千六百七十二人，較之二十一年度增加二千七百八十八校，增學生一萬八千二百八十人。至於二十三年度統計材料，雖尙未徵集齊全，但與二十二年度比較，必有增加，不致减少，就上項總數計之，自十七年度至二十三年度七年當中，已辦民校共二十萬三千六百八十五校，共有學生六百七十九萬五千三百一十四人。這是不識字的民衆，自推行識字運動後，受到識字敎育的，也就是識字運動推行以來一點成績。</p>

<p>— 張鳳</p>
<p>遐庵我公先生大鑒、前在蘇州調查古蹟、會由王佩諍兄遞一說帖、諒已入覽、閱報知公等有吳越史地硏究會之組織、會中特務爲分送奄城金山陶片、會章中定入八九兩專條、提倡學術、先獲我心、記去歲五月、鳳於發見奄城後、陪同蘇州蔣大沂武進陳松茂山西衛聚賢諸君、到府陳述種切、時有人擬即從事發掘、忝俔陳詞、經我公論以現當國帑支絀、時事艱虞之日、漫言發掘、不但無其財、且亦無其才爲勸、實爲至論、至從事調查、加以硏究、乃爲當務之急、所以今日硏究會之組織、實爲鳳與諸公同有是心者也、</p>
<p>某君熱心任事、秉性卞急、去年九月、鳳又從金山黃伯惠昆仲之後、辨認金山亦爲古址、某君又從余之後、央同領看一决、歸即從事宣傳、大報小報、鋪張揚厲、借他人之工作、做一已之宜傳、急欲擯鳳而獨立、所發假論、不待商兌妥貼、而即爭先努力宣傳、不知金山有地下建築、而即發表海水冲來之說、不知遺址有銅鐵器具、而即發表夏少康城之說、所持議論、與鳳差池太甚、鳳時認以爲不可爲伍、而獨與蔣大沂從事室外工作、引用考古學上連類調查方法、（連類或可譯爲連到）此方法歐西人比發掘等量重視、日本人於滿蒙古蹟亦最擅長應用、微聞中央硏究院對於采陶文化之東來、亦將利用此法、以資探險、誠以其能費省而功半也、半歲以來、學校假期之暇、屢屢出門、卒於奄城金山之外、獲得古址十餘處、內有新石器者兩處、附油印節略一份、幸垂閱焉、</p>
<p>金山有「么石器」（此名詞借用並非氷鹿時代之細石器）不足以代表時期、僅以爲刻飾陶紋之用、則事誠有之、而某君另發表一破碎不完僅存四分之一之石塊、並無棱刃鋒鍔之狀態、並無撞擊鱗片之序决、察其印本、幾疑爲類似舊石器、按外人分舊石器爲五種、屬五時期、再加一種未經確鑿論定之「曉人石器」而爲七類、年代相距　遠、或謂六十萬年、或謂六千萬年、或謂三萬六千萬年、而謂金山地帶可以有此石器乎、夫認辨石器、亦有方法、略見前呈拙著「石工具」一文中、而某君所指之石器、比「曉人石器」允爲難辨、去年彼游覽奄城時、某學生於前數日笑指桑樹根下一石片、謂如某先生到此、必以爲石器無疑、此同人等與彼面前面後、每引是以爲笑樂者、而果也、彼一見之後、即什襲而歸、歸而即以石器相號召、報紙傳載、一一可按、叉前於十九年時、南京樓霞山發見幾片極不規則之石片、已經李濟之等吾認、而彼不顧、悍然發表於東方雜志、事後做某書、要鳳題跋認可、鳳爲略加按語、詎叉爲擅自裁改塗飾、變全吾認爲半肯定、事涉游戲、而近日新編首都志、備列藝文目錄中、誠爲憾事、夫以一英法德日、一字不識之人、好談石器、且每到一地、必有石器發見、大有非石器不能滿慾望、非石器不能供宣傳、其貽誤學術、痛心曷可勝言耶、</p>
<p>閱硏究會簡章草案、則叉大異乎我所聞知、簡章對於會務之規定、在八九兩條中、以特務爲常務、夫分送陶片、借作標本、固無不可、在鳳亦時爲之、特來開會宣傳耳、至欲委託各省敎育廳、使各縣小學生、與瘼不相關之民衆、拾襲陶片、則天下斷斷無此考古辦法、是叉欲爲供一己宜傳、而驅使大衆工作也、烏乎其可、昔人有「喝道看梅花」之雅興、今可以「奉官求古跋」作對、那不古趣森然、夫調查之事、非身臨其地不爲功、譬如調查水旱災荒、及其他庶政、豈可以一紙文書託人代查耶、至欲調查左國等書中所有地名、粗言之、則統志通志縣志等應有盡有、細言之、則金山奄城相當於左國書中何地何名、以算盤統計古書數字之人、謂能核算得之耶、</p>
<p>總上緣由、鳳於研究會、欲不加入、無以答諸公之盛意、欲加入、則無以對並世界學人、鳳自分在世界亦曾受學壇訓練之人、在國內亦非全不聰明者、不謂昨到中國書店、詞問開會日期、茫無要領、嗣後得金中淸先生之公郞、某某君寄來不署名之請柬、繼又歷問入會到會之資格與手續、僅餘男女性別未加查問、「刻薄傷仁」、彼書中自謂語、嘻、會本公開、金某個人、自居發起人地位、而顏色她訑、拒人于千里之外、查彼爲回敎靑年、高堂健在、自有敎規與其家訓、足以克複共身心、不爲罪、面鳳于硏究會、則進退徬徨、不知所據、欲入不能、則不入固可、但爲蘇浙史地計、在蘇省人材衆多、竊不敢自以爲任、而鳳固浙人、意自揆度、若忝居末座、備爲代表之一、諒不爲浙省辱、亦不爲該會羞也、茲者、分理若是、遭遇若彼、冷遭熟駡、擠排擯斥、無所不用其極、硏究會開時、又不敢妄自菲薄、放異責職、計維外國學會、有通訊員之設、有宜讀論文之舉、自願入座旁聽、得爲一不入會之會員、投桃報李、永以爲好、惟冀開會時、通知書柬、等飭幹屬先期擲下、免再趦趄門外、欲入無路、鳳以一忒不　溜之人、硜硜自守、庸回顓蒙、惟我公有以開示之、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>『你把你的小寳貝托付給我，承你相信，我眞榮幸了。可是，坦第，這些姑娘們的影響確是很好的。我知道你會笑我，但是我可不管，這我巳是慣了的；我吿訴你，我的一種有趣的想頭，是當我的這一羣孩子像一個小天地，注視我的這些小男兒的進步，最近幷看看我的幾個「小婦人」對於他們所發生的好影響。小梅是家庭式的，她們都感覺到她那種安靜嫻淑的舉止裏自有一種動人的至美。南恩是吵鬧，剛强，有力的女子；他們羨慕她的勇氣，給她一種機會使她能伸展她的意志，知道她是有力氣，有同情，幷有在他們小世界裏做點大事的魄力。你的小珮絲是個淑女，充滿了自然的文雅，婉的和秀麗。她不知不覺能使他們溫文有禮，眞像個好女子，用她的力量使他們永永超越了粗俗鄙吝，使他們終於成爲文質彬彬的眞君子。』</p>

<h3 id="c199">女性優於男性論 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 夢蘇</p>
<p>尋常見解，多以爲男性優於女性。數千年來男性中心的社會，形成了一切重男輕女的思想和行爲，男性自視爲優越者，而視女性爲低劣者。宣敎師口裏的Giving　honour，unte　the　wife　as　unto　the　weaker　vesrel，顯然以宗敎的理論視女性為被保護的弱者了。</p>
<p>其實依體質講，女性確是比較適於生存的先天優越者。雖然男子的筋骨比較女子容易訓練得强靱，而適合於競技方面的發展；但抵抗疾病與延長壽命的力量却是女勝於男。</p>
<p>女子往往是多愁善病的；然而致命的疾病却是女少於男。據醫學上的統計：同樣病症而結果送命的平均數總是男子過於女子。允其似胃病，臟腑的　瘍，肝的發硬，肺炎，氣喘，心臟　弱一類的患者，男子的死亡較多。</p>
<p>男子的平均壽命紋女子爲短。寡婦多於錄男，是個普遍而明顯的事實。照美國的戶口調查統計下來，五十五歲以上的男午數少於女子；七十五歲以上更甚；百歲老人之屬於女性的，多過男子二倍。美國退任總統中健在的只有一個，而總統夫人之健在者尙有六人。這也是可以解嘲的現成好例。</p>
<p>女子容易患頭痛，神經衰弱，癱癎等症。但是陷於自殺的却不如男子之多。平常以爲女子的心量是狹窄的；這裹却可以反證女子的容忍性優於男子了。</p>
<p>或者以爲男子的限部如女子的原因，由於環境的壓迫和後天的　喪。例如　工作過勞，　吸烟，飲酒，飲食起居無規律等等。但是這些理由並不可靠。據美國一九二〇年的死亡登記：一歲以內的男女嬰兒死亡率爲一二五與一〇〇之比。生而即夭與生而殘疾的也以男嬰爲多。</p>
<p>這種種事例，都可以證明女子的先天與後天都較男子爲優</p>

<p>— （芝雲）</p>
<p>但是經醫生檢騐之後，獲得許可的，祇得百分之七，准許增加工作二小時的，計百分之十一。不過在第二次五年計劃開始時，因爲全國的經濟情形，已漸轉佳，消費節制的管理，已相當的寬弛，所以在去年一年間，莫斯科全市，求增加工作時間的，在工業婦女中，僅佔千分之五弱。（獲得許可的，僅千分之一稍強。）</p>
<p>我國的婦女，雖然以從事工業，而引起世人的注意，可是這些年來，在文學方面，努力的也正不少。在莫斯科，在列寗格勒，在高加索，在廣大的西比利亞荒漠中，以至於全國各地，有着數不淸的婦女，都由政府設立的出版機關，特的着撰述，描寫工人或農民等的生活狀况，以及一切痛苦的生活的描繪。伊們所得的報酬，是很豐厚的，而且還有獲得獎章的希望。去年由全國各地，推選出來的一百六十三位文學家中，婦女佔着五十七位。</p>
<p>莫斯科全市，及共近郊，共有托兒所二百餘所，最大的，可容兒童三千八百左右，最小的可容四百。在這些托兒所中服務的，男子僅百分之十七，婦女佔百分之八十三，這是婦女服務比率最高的一個機關。近年來，婦女習醫的，已成一時的風尙。在一九二五年，莫斯科，僅有女醫九十七人，看護四百人左右。但在一九三五年，已增至女醫五百四十七人，（包括產科，牙科，耳鼻科，眼科，骨科，以及獸醫等在內，）看護二千七百餘。其中百分之三十五，是在歐洲各國各醫科大學畢業之後歸國的。任法官的，在全國中，婦女與男子的比率，是十八比一。莫斯科的那個夙有「莫斯科的里諾」之號的離婚法庭中的斯脫羅凡夫，便是婦女法官之一。在俄國，內河中航行的船艘，如今也有很多，由婦女任着船長，或大副。在一條航行海參崴與黑海之間，（經由太平洋），的運貨船，也是由一海參崴航校中訓練的婦女，任着船主。莫斯科的陸軍航空隊中，也有不少婦女，自動的請求入伍，受駕駛，空戰，以及飛行傘降落的訓練。最近，在奧姆司克，作表演戰時，降落的成績，婦女竟勝於男子。</p>
<p>外國人到俄國去旅行的，誰都會感覺到俄國婦女的不平凡，而同時，也會感到婦女普遍的短少着女性的溫柔。但，這或許就是俄國婦女之所以爲俄國婦女，而能有這麽偉大的工作效能的原因吧（這種婦女，和我們中國，專以塗脂抹粉，取悅男性，喝酒打牌，尋求享樂的婦女相較，大家覺得如何？）本報特寫</p>
<h3 id="c201">陳令儀女士對現代婦女的意見 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>中華女子參政會，去年已改組爲中華婦女運動同盟會，理事長爲陳令儀女士，前天我曾去訪問，伊對於婦女運動的意見，伊是一位律師，以前曾任大學敎授，從小在中學的時候，便喜歡參加婦女運動，到現在依然不减當年的豪興。伊說過去所做的工作，偏於上層，現在起，着眼於下層的婦運，此種方針的轉變，可以說所得的經騐的反映，在以前中國的婦女運動，大都偏於智識階級，而現在已傾向於下層工作，這確是婦運的進步。我以爲勞動的大衆婦女。無論是精神生活或物質生活，遠不及高貴婦女所享受的舒適。所以要解放婦女，提高女權，其路綫必須自下而上，由淺人深，纔易奏效。陳女士的話，與我有同感，讀者欲知其詳，請看下文：</p>
<p>陳女士首先對於賢妻良母，有一點意見，大意說：「現在賢妻良母的學說，風行一時，有些人加上一個新」字，好像表示迎合新時代的意思。其實「新」與「舊」還是換湯不換藥的一貫主張，照現代社會與國家的需要，男女處於完全平等的地位，男的不必談賢夫良父，女的也不必談賢妻良母；這是男女必備的條件，母需多所討論。與其唱這些老調，倒不如鼓吹男女怎樣做健全的「公民」，以報效於社會國家，比較切實得多。在中古時代，一個女子只要把家庭管理得好，就算是賢妻良母；在現代，女子只管家事，不問其他，未免太把女子藐視了。應該同男子一樣，來擔當社會國家的大事；况且家事究屬簡單，能爲社會服務的女子，她一定能够治理家庭的。反是不能爲社會工作的女子，她未必能整理家庭的職務。現時女子活動能力，比男子差得太遠，我們應竭力鼓吹婦女們到社會上來，一致努力，不該以家政限制婦女的活動，埋沒她的天才。」</p>
<p>伊第二點意見，說是：「現代中國婦女，不能爲服務社會而放棄家庭，我國與蘇聯的社會制度，截然不同，她們可以减輕家庭的責任，着重社會的工作，而我們應雙方兼顧，最起碼的限度，是要把家政治理好的。我感覺中國的社會制度太壞，婦女職業還不能發展，到處都講私情，而引用私人，道種風氣，至今不能改革；譬如眞有學識有能力的婦女，往往不能得一位置，以發展其懷抱，偏偏能力薄弱的女子，她可以藉私人的勢力，得到較高的地位與酬報，其結果因學議淺薄，服務的效率低劣，予人以不良的印象。因此對女子職業，有非難之聲，這不是婦女本身之過，實因社會各方不以人才爲重，反予婦女不幸的結果。又如國人向來重男輕女，牢不可破的傳統思想，最使婦女職業受重大打擊，希望國家政治漸入軌道，隨在以人才爲前提，自然婦女職業，有平均發展的可能。</p>
<p>陳女士即定社會服務與家事應雙方兼顧的主張，我便問她本人是吾言行一致？她說：「我的家在首都不遠的鄕區，我僑居海上，平時雖不能親自照顧，而家政完全由我設計，雙親依照我的意思去做，彼此取極端合作的辦法」·至此她又答復我處理家政的經騐：「我家有一男二女，都在小學讀書，從小便定下一種規律，無論什麽東西，說給他就給他，說不給他就不給他，孩子們很能服從，因此沒有予取予求以哭笑爲要挾的壞脾氣。不吃零食，不穿綢衣，養成衛生的習慣。寗可多做幾套布衣服，白天可以多多活動，勤換衣服，若是穿了綢衣，小孩要保持淸潔，不能隨意運動，體育上受了限制，倒是不行的。每天各給零用錢一百六十文，而他們只用去半數，還可以積儲起來，養成儲蓄的習慣。我有時把東西留給男孩，他必以半數分給妹妹，反之她也分給哥哥，由小使他們打破重男輕女的思想，引起互助合作的旨趣，這是我一得之愚，不足以當大雅的。……」</p>
<p>伊對於都市一般女生奢侈的習氣，很不贊成，負敎育之責者，應力圖矯正，並須麥成女生團體生活的興味，使她們出校後，依然能鼓起服務社會謀羣衆福利的精神。最後她曾報告過去參加婦運的經過；「我在十六歲時正在南京女師求學，適値五四運動熱烈之時，就時常參加各種活動，升人東南大學（即今中大）之後，感覺年少氣盛，不求實學的危險，埋頭苦讀了數年，又値「五卅」風潮，我們便研究看護的技術，作萬一動員的凖備。民十七年赴法，留學於托魯斯大學，至二十一年返國，其間也過着讀寄生活，不問世本，近年除個人本職外，服務於婦女同盟會，深覺一般婦女失學的苦痛，流亡的悽慘，正想從下層工作做起，比較其他工作，尤爲切要；也可以說從過去婦運的貧乏中，孕育一種新的覺悟和新的努力！」</p>

<p>英前首相麥克唐納女公子將爲小客棧老闆</p>
<p>—羞煞世上整千整萬寄生草—</p>
<p>卓文君下嫁相如，當　售酒，自食其力，千古傳爲美談。今乃有相府千金，敞展尊榮，最近揮業已定，决賽購一十七世紀之鄉間古舊小客寓而自爲之主人，其經過喧騰報章，聳動觀聽，頗足令一般所謂寄生　寄生車也者，悚惶顏汗。茲特譯述其概略如下，俾作我二萬萬女同胞之一服興奮劑焉。</p>
<p>英前首相麥克唐納Ramsay　Mac　Donald之女公子，名　思白Ishbel夙慕旅館行業，據其姊名希蘭，Shella（今爲麥堅能博士，Dr．A，Mackinnon夫人，寓居里子Leeds地方者）云，伊妹自有其經商進行之見解，並友人中之經營旅館業者亦多，常得彼等之指導，故此决擇業計决，購屋佈置，實屬意中事，殊無足異云。</p>
<p>據英倫小報Daily　Sketch記者，探悉麥女士購店計劃，存心已久，且迭作鄉間旅行，藉相屋址，直至最近始看中士偏Speen，地方一小農寓Old　Plon　Inn乃微行窺訪數次，迄十一月廿四日始决定購買，兩星期內當可備辦手續，　返倫敦也（伊現與伊姊同住）。</p>
<p>該寓建於一六二一年，原爲狹小茅屋兩所，至一七二七年，乃合併爲一。的十年前，此屋爲縣長柏結特PatBeckett取得，蓋此屋之第一主人爲卡湯Khar　tonw地方之甘金Kitohener君，而柏結特之妻則甘之女姪也。今該店爲嘉爾特C．B．Child所有，仍理舊業。此君曾將此店內部改造，大興土木，經之營之，四月成之，因之昔之用煤油者今改爲電燈矣，昔之用井水者今亦有自來水矣。但瓦桁參差，壁爐寬大，樓梯曲狹，一仍舊貫，望之猶覺古意盎然。嘉爾特偕其妻及子女各一，分担店務，舉凡辦貨，烹飪，洗滌等事，悉自任之，此外僕媼全無，若事過冗，則住客亦有帮同任事者。店中不備酒宴，啤酒隨時取諸櫥中，藏諸廚旁小窖備用。最可異者，嘉爾特所蓄之貓，亦名藍西，Ramsay適與前首相之尊號電同，令愛之揮業於是，豈非天哉！店旁新設一兒童遊戲塲所，中蓄鳥，兎，驢，犬之屬。他日相府千金得此佳構，顧而樂之，凡事得心應手，生意日隆，可預卜焉。</p>

<h3 id="c204">婦女回到家庭去？ <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 秋英</p>
<p>世界的潮流又在開倒車了，大聲喊着「婦女回到家庭去。」婦女果眞應當回到家庭去嗎？抑一定應當學娜拉的出走？</p>
<p>一般人以爲「男子治外，女子治內」是天經地義。而女性本身，當然不能再忍耐牢籠一般的閨閣。而事實上確也有許多受過高等敎育的女子，結了婚，就與世隔絕起來，不聞不問。（或甚至過她的奢靡的少奶奶生活。）另一方面呢？社會給我們的地位有摧殘，無增進，娜拉出走後怎樣，也是問題。</p>
<p>所以，婦女到底回到家庭去呢？還是跑進社會去呢？現在實是解答不來的間題。事實放在前面，家庭這樣須要婦女；事實又放在前面，社會上這樣不需要婦女；事實更放在前面，婦女在社會上得一地位如此其艱難，而若在家庭中盡其職責，又好像如彼其可能！</p>
<p>但無論如何我們要認淸一個目標：女子是「人」！宇宙根本是男女各半的，我們就應該在地球上站立一個地位。我們不問任何手段，我們的地位總是耍攫得的。</p>
<p>對於我們的朋友—人類的一半的男子。我們本無所用其爭，所爭者是從前失去的我們應有的地位。目標認淸了，就可以向前努力。努力的方略如何呢？我以爲只有「勞動」二字就是我們的無上信條，任何事情，沒有不勞而獲的。中國的革命不澈底，故有洪　帝制的產生：婦女運動不澈底，遂給社會以欲開倒車的口實，不澈底的　結，是在不够「勞動」的努力。所以我們要求婦女的地位，我們只要負起責任來，在家庭負家庭裹的責任，在社會負社會上的責任，我們把成績獻示給大衆，這才是我們的眞實的力量。</p>
<p>本來，當這過渡時期的我們，本是掮起兩重荷擔的，一是忍受舊的痛苦背在屑上，二是背了那個舊的去開闢新路以福後人。自然，嚴格說起來，歷史永遠是在轉變的，除「過渡時期」外無「過去」與「將來」，無論那一時期的人都在負起這兩重肩荷，於是人生就這樣改進了。總之我們不必問酬報而勞動，我們的酬報，在歷史中求之。</p>
<p>所以，我們要注意的：雖說回家庭或入社會那一邊好是不能解答的問題，我們卽要明瞭家庭和社會本是不能分離的二體。在社會上如沒有地位，卽在家庭中沒有地位如僅能盡職於家庭而目光不及於社會，未必能算對於社會盡了責。我們不要受騙，以爲做了賢妻良母卽盡了做人的責任。是的，賢妻良母未始不可做，賢妻良母未始不是重大的責任。而當自己是個賢妻良母的時侯，不要忘了自是爲社會做一個「人」！前者與後者，表面好像一樣，而態度却不同。注意，我們不耍爲似是而非的理論所迷惑。卽當我們回到家庭的時候，要牢記母忘社會。所以夫婦父女兄妹姊弟之間的相處，固純出於戚情，而最要緊的是自己要有一個獨立的人格！</p>

<p>— 陸顧文淑</p>
<p>前次本刋所載張亦菴君所作的法國男女的法律上不平等給我們不少關於法國女子在法律立塲上不能和男子平等之點，這是實足表現出法國女權的低落，這種女權低落的情形能生長在口唱自由平等的民主先進國的法國，的確是令人詫異的，而造成這種低落的原因以作者的觀察不外乎一，宗敎關係，二敎育影響。</p>
<p>一，宗敎關係，法國是天主敎國，人民大多數都信仰天主敎，我們很知道敎會對於女權的擴張是竭力反對的，理由說是根據聖經上說：最完美的女人，做最辛苦的事，手指中握了紡錘，意思是說女人只須躲在家裏料理家務，不用管旁的事，可憐伊們法國女子因爲要服從上帝，做個篤信基督的好婦人，輕輕地把伊們天賦的權利放在一邊了。</p>
<p>二，敎育的影響，在全法國女學校裏，學校當局對於女學生的敎科書及其他讀本都是採用那些敎你怎樣織布，怎樣烘麵包，並且敎你應當馴良，和善，希望把伊們一個個地造成未來的賢妻良母，除去這些課本外，伊們能常見的關於婦女問題的書籍都是三Ｋ主義作者的著作物，法國許多文豪著作家一大半都隸屬在三Ｋ主義的旗幟下，例如</p>
<p>梅蠻司德Joseph　De　Maitre在給他女兒信中曾說：女人最大的過失就是摹倣男人，倣傚男人是伊們的妄想，范南翁Fenelon說，好女人要搓綫，躱藏在一角，聽命和靜穆，莫利愛Moliere會說：有學問的女人是可笑的。這些三Ｋ作家也是造成女權低落的大原因。</p>
<p>記得十八世紀歐洲方面代表新思想的學者服爾德Voltaire因爲說了：女人能有……做男人所能做的一切事，一直到現在還被法國人唾駡，誣他說這句話是恭維當時某一女子而發的，如此看來，女權婆在法國抬頭，日子還遠得很呢。</p>

<p>— 楊陳蒨如</p>
<p>上海之有中國婦女會，始於中華民國七年，其時維新女界之具遠大眼光及學識者，鑒於現代之潮流，欲求社會及文化事業之發展，非賴女界共同努力，羣策羣力不爲功。於是先進琴，經之營之，苦心籌劃，勵志進行，賴社會之提携，得同志之指導，中國婦女會遂得成立其宗旨係聯絡上海婦女，促進社會事業，栽培公民智識，養成國家觀念，鞏固國際友誼，發展婦女應有之文化與技能等等，創辦伊始，因海上五方雜處，習慣不同，方語各異，會員人數無多，殊有時興時替之歎，幸會中先進竭力提倡繼續邁進，使本會在社會上受人欽敬，成爲上海市中富有精神之重要團體，吾儕飲水思源，未嘗不中心藏之，何日忘之，諸先進造福於社會殊非淺鮮，若學商兩界婦女能與淸閒之閨秀，互相提携，共同努力，以謀社會事業之發展，利用女界之慈祥性情，及團結精神，使本會由一小組織而擴充之成爲一大組織，異日中國婦女會之聲名，得揚溢於中國，允頓各界之指導及贊助焉。回憶昔日本會成立時，係謀交際及增進友誼爲目的，嗣後同志等互相切磋，遂出而提倡社會公益，發展平民敎育，贊襄慈善事業，及一切與女界有關係之工作，勇敢前進，不遺餘力，本會先在本埠各處貧民所居住之地，設有義務學校多所，如曹家渡，楊樹浦，西門，及小沙渡路等處之義學是。曹家渡一校，爲一初級小學，修學四年，授以普通國民常識，畢業之後，俾其得以謀生，楊樹浦西門兩區之校，爲勞工婦女補習而設，小沙渡路一所則程度較高，授以平民應有之知識，及日常經濟學，俾學生略知量入爲出，未雨綢繆，聊助其除去生活上之困難，畢業後可爲楊樹浦西門兩校服務，附近該校，叉設有公社，俾該處居民有公餘消遣之地，法至善也。對於上列四校之管理，頗得女靑年會竭誠監督指導，收效甚宏，雖負義校經濟責任者爲本會，而女靑年會恊助辦理亦不敢或忘，且同人等對於各義校舉生之康健，亦未嘗不顧及，除獲敎育栽培外，又得上海市衛生局擔任衛生及醫藥之保護，無微不至，會員亦有於夏季率領義校受業者作郊外旅行，聖誕佳節，亦稍令彼輩可享受兒童幸福此乃本會服務社會之一斑也。</p>

<h3 id="c220">商業整飭 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>自從「貨眞價實」「童叟無欺」的招牌，被「大减價」「買一送一」的旗幟所代替，本市商業，已日趨蕭條，陷於極度恐慌的境地。於是一般商家，爲維持營業計，便不惜用「欺騙」的手段，來吸引顧客，用「傾軋」的方法，以與同業競爭。商人「信」用，商業「道德」不問也。在這種情狀之下，商界有倡議整飭之舉，眞是一個最好的現象。</p>
<p>薄利多賣是對的，商業競爭也無可非議，這都是發展營業的方法。但薄利多賣和商業競爭，應從正當的途徑努力，超越這個途徑，便有失商人信用，有背商業道德。而近來各商家的招引顧客，却一味以欺騙爲能事，在「不顧血本」的號召下，作營利的企圖，至同業的互相排擠，手段更無所不用其極。如綢緞業的競爭，竟以每尺化一分爲標榜，也足見其傾軋的强烈。商人如此不顧信用，不顧道德，祗圖吸引顧客，排擠同業，不但顧客受騙，同業　必兩敗俱傷。其欺騙也祗能取巧于時，日久伎倆截破，終亦無人問津。不見市上許多商店，，大吹大擂，門庭仍然冷落如故。這實是自趨於絕路。</p>
<p>故整飭商業，確是必要的。「商入事業之成功，無他秘訣，不外以謹愼刻苦自勵，以公平明察待人，以謙和待顧客，以互助待同業，如果鄙棄上項原則，而欲花樣翻新，未有不顚仆者。」是以各業應「深良覺悟，顧全商業道德與信譽，統一步驟」蓋非如此，實無以保持商人道德，也無以挽回商業厄運。這亦卽實部所以通令「取締商人虛偽競賣，維持商業道德」之所由來。</p>
<p>然而商業整飭，雖甚正當，但目前的商業狀况，豈是整飭所能救濟的嗎？在經濟恐慌的籠罩下，本市的繁榮，原是浮而的。商業的衰敗，可從「倒閉」「淸理」中見之。而「大减價」的旗幟，更是一個驚心駭目的表現。一般商家，爲何要虛僞宣傳，欺騙顧客，排撥同業？這便是想在「掙扎」下求「生存」。這種方法，自然不能持久，終有失敗之日，但若非如此，恐欲望暫時的維持，也不可得。商業前途的危機，便隱伏在這裏。這也是整個市面所以動盪不安的原因。</p>
<p>故商界要救濟商業，整飭固然必要，這至少可以挽回商人信用，遏止同業傾軋。但根本辦法，還須從振興商業方面努力。因商業自有出路，不正當手段須要改革，同業也才得共存共榮，停止傾軌的競爭。</p>
<h3 id="c221">瞎子先生（續） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>『你們別這樣作惡吧，我今天還沒個子兒生意呢』。</p>
<p>孩子們却儘在旁邊大笑起來。瞎子更留神地用棒子探一步，邁一步，小銅鈴可可地饗，孩子們依然跟上去，不把瞎子先生嬲弄成功他們决不甘散開的，除非到給大人們知道了，責駡着，喚回家去的時候。</p>
<p>對於孩子們常常的故意爲難與搗蛋，實在無法避免。因此瞎子縱心中十分憎恨，但一方還得和氣對待孩子們，他的眼睛雖已失去了光明，而手裏那根棒現在是如同兩隻眼一樣，怎樣從家中走出來，怎樣走過每一條路，街上那一段是什麽店鋪，他都能像明眼的入一般的熟習。所以那根棒，簡直等於第二生命，不能片刻離開，一失掉，要不知如何難堪狼狽。當聽到背後有人在跟的步音，細微的說話聲。他知道又是孩子們找他尋麻煩了。而最懼怕的是棒子給搶了去，於是他首先出力抓緊它，一邊怪可憐地道：</p>
<p>『你們天天作弄我，沒有好死的，後輩子會同我一樣的』。他被纏得忍不住眞實生起氣來。</p>
<p>一個領受着最大的缺憾的痛苦的人，孩子們當然不理解，儘管憑着幼稚的心靈一時的興會，做着自己所欲做的事。何况瞎子，看不見別人，別人却看見他。孩子們便往往越放肆起來。</p>
<p>在瞎子先生眞實生了氣，比較兇狠的咒駡幾句孩子們的手段同樣更利害了些。他那件土藍布長衫是出門的時候新換上的，潑野一點的孩子，看在眼底，悄悄跑到水溝裏摸了一把泥，等瞎子走過，望他的身上狠勁擲去，一伴潔白的長衫馬上髒的一塌糊塗了。</p>
<p>『呃，瞎子今晚有得吃瞎子婆的一番排頭』。</p>
<p>孩子們一面拍掌，一面笑。</p>
<p>瞎子頻頻跺着脚，臉發靑，急得一句話說不出。孩子們這才滿意地各自散去。只賸下瞎子在無人的巷落中，搖着那寂寞而單調的鈴子。他的嘴巴輕輕動着，唸唸有詞，不曉得說什麽，但不外是在暗地裹詛咒那些小孩子吧。可是不久，將走完巷落跨出大街的時分，他猛可地自三級石階上摔了下來，腦袋恰妊碰着一塊石頭，於是血一串串淌　，塗滿半邊臉。</p>
<p>孩子們從藏匿的角落裏帶着低笑跑出來看，沒想到瞎子跌壞了，嚇然瞧到一面血臉，都受驚地溜走了。</p>
<p>原來他們先用一條縄子橫　在離地很高的巷門的兩端，攔阻去路，然後躱過一邊，等瞎子落套。瞎子艱辛地在地上掙扎了半天，才爬起來。摸出手巾，揩掉臉上的血漬。</p>
<p>『媽媽的，不知前生種下什麽孽債，才活受這罪』。</p>
<p>一面走，一面低低怨艾着。</p>

<h3 id="c222">劉醫生 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>劉醫生痛苦地搓着手，在那盞强度的燈光下他的面色顯得更蒼白了。他來回地在室內踱着圈子，當坐在壁爐旁的沙發椅里的時候，他才發覺到壁爐里的煤塊將要燒完，火燄慘色地喘着氣。於是劉醫生又搓着手喊他的僕人根福。</p>
<p>這是劉醫生的休憇室，當根福初來的時候，劉醫生幾决鄭重地吩咐他，沒有聽見呼喚是不能在這屋子里自由出入的，彷彿屋子里藏着什麽秘密似的。根福是個强壯的中年人，他兼使雜差，掛號，包車夫三項職務，在劉醫生身邊做了八年僕人了。他知道主人的意思，在診務完了之後歡喜獨自關在屋子里靜坐的。八年來他從沒有越規地闖進休憇室去，他是這位獨身主人的忠僕。可是最近半個月，有一位姓劉的中年太太的病症使他主人不安起來，他在隔室消楚地聽着主人蹀　的步聲休止地響着。固定的七點鐘晚餐，時常延遲到八點鐘，九點鐘，劉醫生的生活秩序已失了常態。根福更是一步不肯離開坐在隔室聽候主人的呼喚。</p>
<p>晚餐早已預備好了，但是主人從出診回家後就是在休憇室內踱着，聽着呼喚，根福忙端着菜餚推進門去，劉醫生在沙發里不住地搓手，他對根福搖搖頭，「把爐子生得旺一點，我不想吃飯。」他說。</p>
<p>「醫生，今天天氣暖呢。」根福回答</p>
<p>醫生不信任地注視着根福，「不，我冷得很。」</p>
<p>根福在壁爐里添了煤塊。囁嚅着說</p>
<p>「醫生，吃一點飯吧，已經九點半了。」</p>
<p>劉醫生搖着頭向他揮手，那樣懶得開口的樣子，痛苦地皺着眉。根福慢慢地端起菜盤，又問：</p>
<p>「醫生，你好像病了？」</p>
<p>「是的，我病了！」劉醫生微笑着嘆口氣，「根福，從明天起我想停止診務，到什麽地方去走一趟。」馬上從沙發上站起來，「放着，我吃一點罷。」</p>
<p>根福高興地替主人端了飯，站在邊旁說：</p>
<p>「醫生，應該休息休息，我明天去通知那些出診的病家好了。」</p>
<p>「不要去，他們來的時候吿訴我出門了。」</p>
<p>這天劉醫生很早入睡。</p>
<p>第二天有位年靑的女客叩着劉醫生的門，根福開了門上玻璃洞回答他主人出門了。那女客驚訝着說：「沒有的事，醫生的着我今天早上來會他呢。——他什麽時候動身的，到那里去呢？」</p>
<p>「早車走的，醫生沒有說明到什麽地方去。」根福回答了想關上洞門的時候，女客堅求着讓她進來看一看。</p>
<p>那位女客進門後，彷彿非常熟悉似地一直穿過診室去推休憇室的門，根福旣來不及阻止，馬上緊跟着那女客。那女客先到寫字檯上搜查着，翻着抽屜，彷彿一位偵探似的每一宗物件她謹愼地考察着。根福呆呆地站在門口，他不明白這位女客的來歷，更不明白她要一點什麽東西。他看着她從寫字檯搜到書架上，搜到壁爐上堆着的物件。當她覺得失望了倒在沙發椅里的時候又嚴厲地問根福。「醫生到底到什麽地方去了？」又像一頭發在的狗似的跳起來：「吿訴他我媽死了……」那位女客暈了過去。但是劉醫生忽然在門口出現，他抱那女客到診察室去，馬上關上門，下了鎖，根福聽着他急促着打開各個玻璃瓶……</p>
<p>等到根福聽了呼喚進去的時候，那位女客已安坐在醫生身旁，醫生指着她說：「這是小姐，你把樓上的空屋子打掃乾凈，做小姐的臥房。」</p>
<p>醫生馬上忽忙地扶着小姐出門，到大門口才吩咐根福：「有病人來，你回說劉醫生搬家了」。</p>
<p>根福望着這一對奇突的父女的背影，又驚奇又高興地上樓收拾房間去了。</p>

<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>—海航的故事—</p>
<p>是春天了吧。風吹了來已不十分刺臉了，不過還是那末地沉滯，不活潑。，花還沒有盛開，草也不是綠柔柔地可愛。我和老桂兩個終天悶在棧房里，有點象坐牢監，沒神沒氣。三老爹這兩天跑回鄕下去要兩個兄弟來當新夥計，這新夥計老七曾發脾氣地說是「白送死」。老七這日子里也是終天跑進跑出的，一天到晚不回來，很象忙着甚麽事。聽人家說；他正在踏門路。他說過—「便是這番賣猪仔，也不幹這一行當」。</p>
<p>棧房裏便光剩了我倆，悶悶地坐着。省城我們沒親戚，便算有一頭兩個也不想去，怕人家嚕哩嚕囌地問那一决有沒有傷了人的事。提起了那伴事，我們便會發脾氣，寗願大家放在肚子里吹鼓脹也不願象家當般嘩啦嘩啦地響。</p>
<p>二老板有一個鷹咀般尖的鼻，只要它一翹，便又是發氣。一發氣便要找人駡：不是駡阿三沒吹足雅片，便說阿四昨夜「打飛機」。嚇得我們前面鋪也不敢站，便寗願獃坐在這臭薰薰的棧房里嘗這可怕的滋味。每一個人心裏都有苦，但誰也不先說一說，很象怕說穿了時便沒味道。</p>
<p>有時我們也想到外面逛逛，獃坐着比坐牢監還煩死。於是，我們想到新塡地；想到中央公園；想到半夜上觀音山，看那些不要臉的學生哥，在那裏一雙一對地鬧鬼；更想到或者到大新公司天臺看看野鷄，開開心。便算是最無聊地，慢慢的在馬路上散步吧，從雙門底到東堤，或者從十八甫出福德里，入陳塘去看看一些三等寨口里的豆泥老舉。但，誰也提不起興致。</p>
<p>外面洒着雨了。一提到雨，我們不禁又—</p>
<p>「刁你老母個爛臭貨，又落雨……</p>
<p>下面的便不敢說下去。一提到雨，自然又得提到前幾天在白鵝潭白蛻殼那里的沉船，更得提到五叔，我們幾個老同伴，一個敦厚的忠實穩健的傢伙，他怎樣拼命，他怎樣掉到水里去，到現在還沒有他的屍骸的踪影。</p>
<p>我們相互瞧了一下，又低下了頭了。</p>
<p>「這樣，我們又過了三天，…三天！…」</p>
<p>老桂嘆着氣在說。還沒說完，實在看他樣子也不願說完了。前頭鋪面便飄來了凄切的聲音—</p>
<p>「二老爺，阿五　一次…這一次…怎末了？…他要是番生不來，我們怎樣過活咧？…我們一家四口，便靠他一個，便靠他一個，…二老爺，你不是不知道的了，我們在鄉下土也沒多一塊，田也是種人家的，要是老五他萬一有了不測，死…死了，我們：你看，兩個還是四五歲，一個還沒斷奶…嗚嗚嗚……</p>
<p>末尾是凄切的哭聲，斷斷續續地。鋪面很寂靜，很象沒有什麽人，只有她—五叔的老婆一個人，在哭，在乞求。老桂咬着肥厚的下唇，很肉緊，差不多嚙出血了。一會，又呢呢喃喃地自語：</p>
<p>「刁那媽臭貨，要命，眞要命！那矮烟筒的兵艦，那掛起紅日旗的契弟船，如果不是它駛過來，我們會弄翻嗎？刁你老母矮仔，有一天，看你老子殺一個痛快，不要在這里耀武揚威……」</p>
<p>他站起來，眼睛胃着</p>
<p>忽地，前面舖，又　　了，一個聲音搶進來說—「老五的　　着了，二老板」！跟着便是什亂的　　，夾什着五嬸的尖銳凄厲的哭聲。我們連想也沒想地趕出來了，二老板擺着架子坐在賬房里抽水烟筒，有點皺着眉頭，也有點兇神惡煞的。我們沒有打理他，便拉了報信的阿福，搶着出去，五嬸也跟着在後面。</p>
<p>在馬路上我們走得很蹌蹌，差不多跌倒，也差不多碰番了人，孩子在哭着，呌着，跳着。還算好，沒多遠便是高崗方便醫院了。我們走進了騐屍房，一般臭氣冲着我們也管不得了，直走到五叔的屍骸面前我們才定了一定神。五嬸還沒認淸楚，便一注眼淚地跌在地上哭了，孩子更哭得厲害。</p>
<p>五叔有點兇惡的睡直在那里，身體給水灌得滿滿的，象一隻吹了水的死猪，面孔流着血，也流着水，但是積鬱的憤悶的面孔我們是可以看得到的。</p>
<p>不知怎的，咬實了牙根，我們走到馬路上來了。馬路也悶煞人，是一個怪天氣，不是春天。</p>

<h3 id="c229">中國大偵探陳查禮 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 白芸</p>
<p>華納夏能來滬</p>
<p>將於明日到上海</p>
<p>華納夏能來流之說，屢誌各報，現據確息，彼將於本月二十二日（星期日）搭乘亞細亞皇后輪船抵滬。到滬後，將在上海，南京和北平，遊覽兩星期。滬上中西人士，已在籌備歡迎，屆時當有一番盛况。他在銀幕上所飾的陳查禮，是銀幕上唯一的著名中國人物，差不多全世界都知道了。他的最新任作「上海血案」Charlie　Chan　in　Seanghai　不久將在本埠大光明戲院公映了。關于你的屢歷，我現在先來向讀報諸君報吿一下：</p>
<p>華納夏能——陳查禮</p>
<p>這兩個名字差不多是二而一了。他們都顯出是一種鎭靜和博學的人物，賦有高深的智慧和敏捷的才斡。華納夏能在銀幕上的演出，所表出陳查禮的特性，好像比一個實在的人物還要來得眞切和動人。</p>
<p>華納夏能的「上海血案」，是二十世紀福斯公司一部最新的出品。那銀幕上的著名中國偵探，又從一個神秘的無頭血案中，建樹了一番奇功了。這是他第十次飾這個角色。華納夏能開始主演陳查禮影片，是在一九三一年，故事的來源，都是採取美國名作家別裘氏的偵探小說。這小說以前曾有人想將它搬上銀幕，但是試了三次都歸失敗。其時華納夏能，曾經扮演這東方人的自己，別人認爲他到有些機會，果然一試成功，當時和他同被試驗的演員，却也有十九位之多呢。</p>
<p>因爲他那眼臉的有力收縮，他那眉尾的上掃，他那兩髭的下垂，華納夏能用不着化裝，就很像一個東方人了。他的第一部陳查禮片子是Charlie　Chan　Carries　on很博得批評家的讚美，承認他是銀幕上的一個優秀演員。他於一八八〇年的十月三日，誕生於瑞典的歐米亞縣，於十二歲時，即隨同家人喜到美洲，住在波士頓。</p>
<p>卓别林新片「摩登時代」　　與女主角寶拉戈黛德</p>
<p>他靑年的時候，有過做法官的志願，但是從波士頓高等學校畢業後，他就忘了一切，跑到柯立戲劇學校肄業去了。在那裏，他是練習歌唱的，所以他賦有一個美妙的低音歌喉。有一天，他同着一班同學到一個波士頓戲院的後台去，號裏正在排演一部戲叫The　Christian，他就在那部戲裏起了一個角色，演完以後，班主出每週十五元的薪金，聘他環遊全國登台，經華納夏能的要求，結果以每週十八元成議。</p>
<p>從此以後，他在舞台上幹了十四年，到過許多地方，演過易卜生和莎士比亞的戲，他的第一次獻身銀幕，係在Jewels　of　The　Madonna　一片裏，後來百代攝製Patriai　一片，裏里有一個中國角色，本來已經聘了一個東方演員，但是因爲那個演員的長度不合，才由華納夏能去担任這個角色。他在主演陳查禮影片以前，還曾演過很多的影片。</p>
<p>他的妻子埃　希恩，是波斯頓一個著名的畫家，因此他在結婚以後，對於此道，也就頗感興趣。在聖巴巴拉　近他的家裏，掛着很多的油畫和藏着許多中國的藝術珍品。他們夫妻，大都數的時候，是住在家裏，但有時也要到巴爾梅圓島他那七千畝地的牧塲上去勾留一星期，在拍戲的時候，他們是住在貝維里山旅館的一間茅舍裏的，他們倆有時出外散步，有時並肩作寫生畫，他們都喜歡遊泳和日光浴，他們出遊時候固定伴侶，就是兩頭愛犬</p>

<p>(B) The Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration Organizational Law consists of 16 articles: (1) The Customs Administration, under the direction of the Minister of Finance, manages national customs administration and establishes three sections: General Affairs, Customs Affairs, and Tariff Rules.

The number of personnel may not exceed half the number of personnel of the Administrative Bureau. (20th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Each Salt Administrative Bureau establishes one Director, one Deputy Director, one Chief of the General Affairs Department, one Chief of the Production and Sales Department, and one Chief of the Tax Police Department. The salt fields under the jurisdiction of the Salt Administrative Bureau may be divided into regions by the Salt General Bureau, with Salt Field Offices established for management. Salt Field Offices are divided into four grades, and each Salt Affairs Office establishes one Director, with two salt affairs members below. Salt Field Offices may appropriately establish tax collection members, weighing and release offices, and tax police outposts. The Salt General Bureau establishes one Accounting Director, one Statistics Director, and 50 to 65 staff members. When salt tax collection is not completed in the fields, with the approval of the Finance Minister, temporary salt affairs offices are temporarily established in important production and sales provinces, directly managed by the General Bureau to clear stockpiled salt and collect outstanding salt tax. The number of personnel may not exceed half of the personnel of the Administrative Bureau. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing The Ministry of Finance's Organizational Law, as amended, has changed the Salt Affairs Office to the Salt Administration Department, and the Salt Audit General Office to the Salt General Bureau. According to the Ministry of Finance, after the National Government promulgates the above Organizational Law, it can be reorganized accordingly, and in the future, personnel will be transferred preferentially. Although agencies such as transport envoys, deputy transport envoys, audit branch offices, and monopoly transport bureaus and collection bureaus in various provinces have been separately changed to Salt Affairs Administrative Bureaus and temporary offices, reorganization will only begin after their own organizational laws are promulgated. Furthermore, the Salt Audit General Office is currently located in Shanghai; it is yet to be determined if it will be relocated to Beijing after the reorganization.

<h3 id="e13">Recent Developments in the Far East Situation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Although the international situation in the Far East has recently maintained a superficial state of "stability" and "peace," in reality, it harbors many significant crises and complex conflicts of interest. A comprehensive analysis of these relationships can be divided into the following aspects: The first aspect is the promotion of Hirota's proactive and independent diplomacy in East Asia, the progress of "frank and open" diplomatic talks between China and Japan, and the early expansion of Japanese troops stationed in China. The second aspect is the advance of the "Red Peril" into North China and Stalin's strong and explicit attitude regarding the Far East issue. The third aspect is the recent activities of Britain in South China and the joint defense of the "Eastern Gateway" Singapore naval base by Britain and the United States in an attempt to counter Japan (as reported by the Montreal Gazette of the United States). Because these three aspects are currently developing, the entire Far Eastern international relations also exhibit a fully potential and active situation.</p>
<p>Since the February 26th Incident, Japan's diplomacy toward China has become increasingly active and assertive, which is a clear fact. The travels of Military Attaché Isoya to Beiping, Tianjin, and Jinan, and Ambassador Arita's continuous talks with our diplomatic authorities, their missions and content, we do not know in detail. However, we can get a glimpse of the backbone of Japan's future policy towards China simply by looking at Foreign Minister Hirota's policy towards China announced on the 10th of this month, which states that "we will vigorously promote the realization of the three principles to complete the complete cooperation between China and Japan, in order to establish the China-Japan-"Manchukuo" three-nation group, and to prevent Mongolia from escaping the danger of communism, and to strengthen its continental policy for the sake of ensuring the national survival rights of the China-Japan-"Manchukuo" three nations."</p>
<p>Japan's step-by-step tightening of its policy toward China has created a greater risk of completely closing the door to East Asia and a more solid foundation for East Asian monopoly. For the sake of their interests in the Far East, the Western countries, as pointed out by the authoritative writer on Far Eastern issues, Nathaniel Peffer, have only three options: to advance, to retreat, or to probe forward. Judging from the current trend, Britain, the United States, and Norway are determined to take the last path. The presentation of the British Cabinet's Defense White Paper, the reinforcement of military bases in Singapore and Hong Kong, the passage of a large military budget bill by the US Congress, Senator Pittman's denunciation of Japan, and the recent trend of closer relations between Britain and Russia are all moving towards countering East Asian monopoly.</p>
<p>Although the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union has recently shown a tendency to ease due to the establishment of a joint investigation committee between the two countries, the ongoing negotiations on border demarcation issues, and the expression of concessions on the issue of the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed in the Far East, we must not separate the Red Peril in North China from the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. In essence, if Japan's monopolistic policy towards China strengthens by one layer, then the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will inevitably become more tense. Even if there are no border conflicts with Manchukuo and the Mongolian puppet regime, and the fishery issue and the Sakhalin Island issue are completely resolved as Japan hopes, is it possible for the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union to fundamentally ease? Therefore, our observations are completely contrary to those of Japan. We believe that the strength of the "Red Peril" and Japan's monopolistic power over China are increasing in direct proportion.</p>
<p>In short, the current international relations in the Far East are clearly moving towards a very important stage. On the one hand, the confrontation between Japan and the Soviet Union on the Far Eastern continent is becoming more tense, and on the other hand, the intensification of Japan's monopolistic control is further strengthening the activities of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China. Under this situation, China's response strategy will inevitably feel difficult. Of course, diplomatic relations should be fully utilized, but national independence, survival, and the integrity of sovereignty are ultimately more important than anything else. The people of the country should recognize and pay close attention to this Far Eastern situation, which is superficially calm but internally extremely active.</p>

<p>London - The agreement negotiated by Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy in response to Germany's actions was initialed by the representatives of the four countries yesterday, and was approved by the British and French Cabinets last night. The British Cabinet met from 10:00 PM to 11:30 PM to discuss the agreement and the report presented by Foreign Secretary Eden on his meeting with German representative General Ribbentrop, who was attending the Council of the League of Nations. When the House of Commons meets at 3:00 or 4:00 PM today, Prime Minister Baldwin or Foreign Secretary Eden will come to the House to declare the overall situation and issue a white paper containing the full text of the agreement. It is said that the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Submitting the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for judgment on whether it is inconsistent with the Locarno Treaty (Germany has claimed that this treaty violates the Locarno Treaty, using it as an excuse to send troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland).</p>
<p>Joint planning by the British and French army staff to protect the border.</p>
<p>Britain guarantees to come to the aid of France and Belgium if they are invaded.</p>
<p>Submitting a resolution confirming the dignity of treaties to the Council of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Holding an international conference, the agenda of which includes Hitler's peace proposals, disarmament, economic issues, and the Central European issue. France now hopes that if the International Court of Justice at The Hague rules that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty does not violate the Locarno Treaty, Germany should withdraw its troops from the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland to restore the original state. However, it is currently difficult to determine whether Germany is willing to do so. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>France Withdraws Two Demands</p>
<p>London - German troops will remain stationed in the Rhineland. France consulted with the other signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain, Belgium, and Italy, and made two important demands: Germany withdraws its troops from the reoccupied demilitarized zone of the Rhineland; International police forces are responsible for the defense of the area. Yesterday, these two demands were withdrawn. The impact of this move is tantamount to de facto cancellation of the existence of the demilitarized zone, as France finally agreed to acknowledge the dangerous situation caused by Germany's breach of contract in sending troops. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris Satisfied, Berlin Relieved</p>
<p>Paris - Responsible parties here are satisfied with the agreement reached by the Locarno Treaty countries, allowing it to obtain the impression that British-French cooperation has been established. Although this move is not without difficulties, it is not worth mentioning. French Foreign Minister Flandin flew back from London today and immediately consulted with Prime Minister Sarraut. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Government officials were greatly relieved to hear that the Locarno Treaty countries had reached an agreement, saying that it would reduce tension. The proposal to hold an international conference was widely welcomed, but it was felt that including the Central European issue, disarmament, and economic issues in the agenda would slightly increase the difficulty of the conference, as the seven points proposed by Hitler on March 7th were sufficient to include everything. Also, regarding the proposal to submit the issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is inconsistent with the Locarno Treaty to the International Permanent Court of Justice at The Hague for adjudication, it is believed that this does not involve the political and military aspects of the treaty. As for Britain's guarantee to provide assistance to France and Belgium in the event of aggression, it is generally seen as only temporarily necessary and will no longer be needed when a new treaty is established.

<p>London - The draft agreement established by the Locarno Conference was simultaneously published in London and Paris today. The content is divided into two parts:</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>Includes the measures to be taken by the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, with a total of seven articles: Germany's unilateral act of abolishing international obligations is solemnly condemned; The various clauses contained in the Locarno Treaty shall be declared by the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium to continue to be valid. The mutual assistance measures contained in the Treaty shall be implemented by the military staff of the countries concerned concluding agreements; Regarding the issue of whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty is in conflict with the Locarno Treaty, the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium shall invite Germany to submit it to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for adjudication and accept the adjudication; The number of German troops stationed in the Rhine River area shall be limited to the number announced by the German government. In addition, the number of members of national socialist military organizations and aviation organizations shall also be limited to the current number; The area within 20 kilometers east of the border between France and Belgium shall be allocated to the international troops organized by the guarantor countries of the Locarno Treaty; The above measures shall be supervised and implemented by the International Committee; The various suggestions put forward in the German memorandum of March 7th should be participated in by Germany when negotiations begin in the future. However, the two suggestions regarding the non-aggression treaty between Eastern European countries and Germany's return to the League of Nations are not included in this negotiation. In addition, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium should conduct negotiations to correct the current system in the Rhine River area and conclude a mutual assistance treaty to replace the Locarno Treaty (the agreements to be established by the military staff of each country should also be included).

In addition to the first and second parts of the agreement, there are two types of annexes. One is the Council's resolution condemning Germany, and the other is the letters sent by Britain and Italy to France and Belgium, which have stated the steps that each country should take in the event that Germany rejects this agreement.

<p>London - General Ribbentrop, the German representative attending the Council of the League of Nations, visited the British Foreign Office early today, but his purpose is unknown. As for the Locarno Peace Plan, it is currently being carefully considered by Berlin, and there will be no reply in a day or two. According to sources in London, Germany cannot agree to any one-sided plan. It is decided that the German delegation to London will be accompanied by 30 experts, including experts in colonial affairs, so their arrival is prepared for a wider discussion. However, the Locarno Treaty countries obviously want to wait until this issue is resolved before taking a break for some time and then dealing with others. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the intentions of political circles here, the passage of a motion by the Council of the League of Nations condemning Germany for violating the treaty does not affect the issue of Germany's re-entry into the League of Nations, as the two issues are completely unrelated. The government office was very active tonight, and Aviation Minister General Göring has hastily flown back to Berlin from Breslau, indicating that the government is holding important discussions. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Propaganda Minister Goebbels is currently in the city of Breslau and was originally scheduled to deliver a lengthy election speech tonight. He was temporarily summoned back to the capital to participate in the cabinet meeting, so he only gave a one-hour speech and flew back to Berlin after the speech. Also, the torch parade originally scheduled to be held in the city of Breslau tonight has also been cancelled. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The "Night News" has just published an article by the newspaper's London correspondent. As generally viewed, this article should be directly authorized by the German delegation in London. The main points are: "London news, the Locarno Treaty countries have already established a draft agreement. Although its content has not yet been officially confirmed, if what is reported is true, then it must not be acceptable to Germany. This agreement is actually a real danger. As for the demilitarized zone of the Rhine River, it has become a relic of the past. If Germany wants all its sovereignty in that area to be restricted again, then it is not acceptable to the German government. "If a neutral zone is not established, then it should also exist within France." The issue of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty being in conflict with the Locarno Treaty and being submitted to the International Permanent Court of Justice at The Hague for adjudication is also not a solution, as this case is only a political issue, not a legal issue. The newspaper mentioned that the military staff of Britain, France, and Belgium had discussed a military agreement, saying that Germany should also participate in it. Finally, it said that the Council of the League of Nations passed a draft resolution of France and Belgium pointing out Germany, which was too hasty. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>London - Foreign Secretary Eden, in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon regarding the European political situation, declared that the Locarno powers (i.e., Great Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy) have reached an agreement regarding the issues arising from Germany's unilateral abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and its reoccupation of the Rhineland with military forces. A White Paper containing the details of the agreement has also been published. Eden stated that the four powers believe it is appropriate to invite Germany to participate in a major discussion in the League of Nations Council, providing them with an opportunity to state their reasons before a vote is taken. The Council meeting has not yet concluded and will resume on Monday. The Committee of Thirteen is expected to meet tomorrow to consider the replies from Italy and Abyssinia regarding peace negotiations. The German reoccupation of the Rhineland is clearly a fait accompli from the outset, making it extremely difficult to reopen negotiations with Germany. Eden continued his commentary on the White Paper, stating that the main objective of the UK is to restore confidence in international law and create conditions conducive to rebuilding European security. The four powers have requested that Germany submit the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact to the Hague Court for arbitration and have obtained the consent of the related countries. It is suggested that small army units from the Locarno Treaty guarantor countries be formed into an international force to be stationed in a narrow zone on the eastern side of the Franco-German and Belgian-German borders. During the negotiation period, Germany should undertake not to reinforce the troops already in the Rhineland or engage in the construction of defensive works. France and Belgium would undertake not to send troops to the border. The UK is prepared to provide the necessary troops for the international force. The UK has reaffirmed its obligations under the Locarno Treaty and intends to conclude army staff agreements with Italy, France, and Belgium to address unprovoked aggression. The agreement reached by the four powers is fair and reasonable and will be submitted to the League of Nations Council. In view of the moderate attitude adopted by France and Belgium, it is reasonable to ask Germany to contribute to resolving the situation caused by its actions. The Locarno powers should undertake negotiations based on several proposals in Germany's memorandum of March 7 and on a draft mutual assistance pact that the Locarno powers could all join, given the changing situation in the Rhineland. The next stage will be a world conference regarding Germany's other suggestions, namely security, armaments, and economic relations. The British and Italian governments should inform the French and Belgian governments of the position they will take if negotiations fail. He very much hopes that Germany will accept this suggestion.

<p>London - This morning, the British press showed mixed reactions to the new Locarno plan. The Times expressed hope for Hitler's suggestions, viewing them as solid, able to open a path back to action and reality, and to form a new foundation for law and its observance. The Morning Post was pessimistic, stating that Germany is still unwilling to submit the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact to an international court. Unless France abandons the pact, the points raised by the Locarno powers will not be agreed upon, but France may not be able to abandon the pact. The Daily Leader stated that the matter rests with Hitler, who can end the crisis with a single word and open a path to genuine world peace through new efforts. The Daily Telegraph noted that this is a promising peace plan, but General Ribbentrop's speech before the League of Nations Council yesterday did not contain a single word suggesting that Germany is willing to compromise on the consensus of the Locarno powers. The Daily News, from an isolationist standpoint, ridiculed the suggestions. The Daily Mail urged Hitler to continue to express a peaceful attitude. France has now made significant moves, and if Germany can freely offer concessions, it will provide much-needed lubricant for the next stage of progress. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>London - If the agreement drafted by the Locarno Treaty signatories is accepted by Germany, a large-scale peace conference will be convened in Geneva or Brussels in May. Not only will all member states of the League of Nations be invited to participate, but non-member states such as the United States and Japan who wish to participate may also send representatives. The objectives of the conference are fourfold: 1. To discuss the implementation of the peace plan proposed by Chancellor Hitler; 2. To resolve the Central European organization issue; 3. To negotiate an arms limitation pact, with the future naval treaty as its first stage; 4. To resolve various financial and economic issues based on the outline of the 1933 London World Economic Conference, in order to achieve world recovery. These issues include (a) currency stabilization, (b) free trade, and (c) international public and private loans. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - According to reports from London, a second Versailles peace conference centered on resolving the Locarno issue will be convened in London in May, inviting non-League countries such as Japan, the United States, and Germany to participate in order to promote a world peace conference in name and in fact, and to conduct a re-examination of the overall situation of political economy and society for the sake of peaceful construction. It is said to be the intention of British official circles. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs holds the view that the European political situation has not yet reached such a stage, and expresses its opinion as follows:</p>
<p>Before the relations between Germany and France and between Germany and the Soviet Union after the German troops entered the Rhineland have been resolved, it is premature to combine these issues and create a broad range of world problems, bringing countries together to discuss them.</p>
<p>Since Japan, the United States, and Germany have already withdrawn from the old peace institutions, which have been unable to provide appropriate solutions to the current disputes in Europe, if the United Kingdom recognizes this, then the United Kingdom should think big and make efforts to create a great world conference that can effectively discuss the most effective ways to eliminate the causes that threaten world peace. Otherwise, we cannot agree. (Domei News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>London - The draft agreement reached by the Locarno Conference yesterday will be distributed to the representatives of the Council member states for review during a closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Council at 5:00 PM today. It includes three draft resolutions in total. Once the Council holds a public meeting on Saturday or Monday of this week, it will formally submit them to the Council for approval. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London - According to well-informed sources, the German representative needs to consult with his government before formally accepting or rejecting the draft agreement reached by the Locarno Conference. Therefore, the Council meeting will continue to be held in London until Thursday of next week, awaiting the German representative to receive instructions from his government. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London - The League of Nations Council held a public meeting at 3:40 PM this afternoon and unanimously passed the joint draft resolution proposed by France and Belgium, declaring that Germany violated Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and the articles of the Locarno Treaty. Among the attending countries, only Chile abstained from voting. Germany voted against it, but this vote was not counted (because both France and Belgium are parties to the dispute). After the meeting, Chairman Bruce declared, "The speeches made by the representatives of France and Belgium were moderate and admired by the world. The speech given by the German representative Ribbentrop this morning was peaceful and created a good atmosphere. This atmosphere is indispensable for international cooperation." After the voting was completed, Chilean representative Edwards explained his reason for abstaining, saying that his country had not signed the Treaty of Versailles or the Locarno Treaty. German representative Ribbentrop also stood up to speak, protesting the Council's resolution, saying that the responsibility for destroying the Locarno Treaty lies with France, so Germany refuses to accept the resolution. He also said that if the Council had considered Germany's arguments at length before voting, the result of the voting would have been different. He concluded by saying, "The German government believes that right and wrong will be judged by posterity. Today's resolution of the Council cannot be taken as a final conclusion." At this point, French Foreign Minister Flandin stood up to respond, saying that he did not want to speak originally, but could not remain silent after hearing Ribbentrop's words. "According to the rules of international law, any dispute should be resolved according to legal procedures, not arbitrarily by any country. I am now reiterating the suggestion made by my government, that the dispute between France and Germany should be submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague for adjudication."

<p>New York - According to the latest survey today, the unprecedented floods in the eastern United States have claimed the lives of 135 people. At the same time, rivers everywhere continue to overflow. Although the water level in some places has receded slightly, some cities are still completely isolated. At least hundreds of thousands of people are homeless, and property losses are increasing by millions every hour. New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Ohio, Maryland, and West Virginia and Virginia are still severely affected. The receding water level of the Ohio River has completely destroyed the "Golden Triangle" area of downtown Pittsburgh. Moreover, the water level downstream of the river has risen sharply again, reaching Wheeling, the capital of West Virginia. As of this afternoon, the floodwaters have not subsided. All of the city's industrial and commercial centers have been flooded. Sixteen people have died. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>

Electricity supply in Pittsburgh has been completely interrupted, and traffic is also blocked. Newspapers have not been published. A large part of the city is still flooded. Collapsed houses are everywhere. The loss in Pittsburgh alone is $25 million. There were repeated explosions in the town of Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania today. The waters of the Allegheny River continue to rush into the city. Thousands of residents are fleeing as oil tanks of oil companies continue to explode. A house where displaced people were gathered was washed away, injuring thirty people. The water level of the Potomac River also continues to rise. Washington is making all preparations. President Roosevelt had intended to travel to Florida, but this has now been temporarily halted. He has issued a fundraising appeal, planning to raise $3 million for disaster relief. Railway and highway traffic in many places is blocked by water, so there are great concerns about food shortages in the disaster areas.

<p>Washington - According to the Associated Press, from President Roosevelt's medical advisor Dr. McIntire, Roosevelt's current health is actually better than when he took office three years ago, and his weight has also increased to 182 pounds. McIntire stated that when the President took office, it was at the time of the national economic panic. Roosevelt had to deal with a myriad of affairs and had no time to rest, but he dealt with it with a completely optimistic attitude and a happy expression, so he was able to cope with ease and without any suffering. Recently, the Supreme Court has struck down Roosevelt's policies several times, and Congress is gradually betraying him. The Republican Party is attacking him from the outside, and Smith is destroying him from the inside. His encounters are becoming more and more difficult, but Roosevelt has never shown the slightest displeasure. The hair on the top of Roosevelt's head is now becoming sparser, and the wrinkles on his face are also more numerous and deeper than before, but his eyes are still sharp and bright and cannot be stared at. The doctor also said that the President sleeps about eight hours a day. He usually wakes up around eight or eight-thirty in the morning, gets up, and has breakfast while reading various morning newspapers. Under normal circumstances, he starts working at 10:15 AM and ends at 5:00 PM. After finishing work, he swims in the White House swimming pool or does other physical exercises. After completing the exercises, he rests briefly and then has dinner and goes to bed around 11:00 PM, but he may not be able to fall asleep immediately. The doctor wrote that the President is very frugal with his diet. He likes to eat scrambled eggs for breakfast. He usually has lunch at his desk. During the summer, he only has a clear soup and a dish of vegetables. In winter, in addition to soup and vegetables, he adds a dish of fish. This is the same even when he has one or two guests. Finally, Roosevelt has not had any major illnesses since taking office. He suffered from colds several times when he first took office, and he also had a slight cold last winter.

<p>Washington - The Department of Commerce announced today that China's recent trade surplus with the United States has greatly improved in January due to the increase in US purchases of Chinese goods by onefold compared to the same period last year. According to the Department of Commerce statistics, the value of US imports of Chinese goods in January was US$8,328,000, compared to US$4,166,000 in the same period last year. US exports to China have also increased, to US$4,251,000, compared to US$2,875,000 in the same period last year. The authorities here believe that China's trade surplus is the result of implementing currency controls and expect that the surplus in the trade balance will allow China to continue the currency control system without having to sell large amounts of silver. If the surplus can still be maintained in the future, then the US$50 million obtained from the recent sale of silver to the US Treasury in New York will be useless. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Under the Plan of the Korean Government-General: The Mission of the Manchuria-Korea Colonization Company: In addition to the Continuous Immigration of Japanese to the Northeast, a Larger Scale Relocation of Koreans to Develop Agricultural Areas <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The fertile land in the Northeast is a natural agricultural area. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese people have immigrated to the Northeast in an endless stream, and Korean farmers have also been continuously relocated to the Northeast. Subsequently, the Japanese established the "Manchuria-Korea Colonization Company" with the purpose of moving Koreans to the Northeast. Last year, a plan centered on the Korean Government-General to realize the merger of the new company with the East Asia Encouragement Company was decided. The Colonial Bank of Korea invested 20 million yuan, which has been approved by the Japanese Ministry of Finance. The East Asia Encouragement Company in "Fengtian" will be closed first in order to merge with the new company. The assets of the East Asia Encouragement Company are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>It is found that the East Asia Encouragement Company was established in December of the tenth year of the Taisho era with East Asia Development, South Manchuria Railway, and Okura Group as major shareholders, as well as Korean aristocrat Park Yong-hyo, etc., with the South Manchuria Railway's invested land as the center, developing rice fields in the Northeast, protecting Korean farmers in the Northeast, and developing capital of 20 million yuan. Its headquarters was established in "Fengtian." After starting business, the Okura Group withdrew, and the management was unsatisfactory due to the opposition between East Asia Development and South Manchuria Railway. The East Asia Encouragement Company's newly revised policy is for social profit, and managing land such as the Tongliao Farm near "Fengtian", based on the Korean Government-General's immigration plan, and receiving Korean refugees from the "Manchuria" Incident, such as the management of land in Yingkou, Andong, Suihua, Tieling, Sanyuanpu, etc., based on the instructions of the Japanese Kwantung Army, managing land for Japanese immigrants, such as in Jiamusi, Baoqing County, Ashihe, and Mishan, the above three departments are merged, and engaged in livestock and rice milling businesses. According to current reports, the total assets of the company, including 129,862 hectares of precision land, are worth 3 million yuan, and the buildings on the land in "Xinjing" and "Fengtian", and others, are worth 5 million yuan, totaling 8 million yuan. After deducting 5 million yuan borrowed from South Manchuria Railway, there is still a surplus. The majority of the company's employees are expected to transfer to the "Manchuria-Korea Colonization Company" after the merger, and some are going to the company with the hope of being a Japanese immigrant company, and the current expected average daily salary is increased by 30%. The company is also preparing for the merger with the "Manchuria-Korea Colonization Company" and is evaluating assets. However, the company's outstanding matters within this year, such as the Yingkou Second Security Village, 1,200 Korean immigrants, of which 600 households in the first phase of the project, will be completed by the "Manchuria-Korea Colonization Company" this autumn. It is heard that the company plans to exert a greater mission in Japan's national policy after the merger. (Northeast Society)</p>
<h3 id="e85">With the Arrival of Spring Flood Season, the Sea Wall Project in Zhejiang Province is in a Dangerous State: Several Sections of the Hangzhou-Pinghu Section Already Show Cracks; the Water Conservancy Bureau Requests Funds for Urgent Repairs <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Communication: The Zhejiang Provincial Jianghai Sea Wall Project is more than 300 kilometers long and is a guarantee for the lives and property of the people of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and the seven counties of Su, Chang, Song, and Tai in Jiangsu. In previous years, the provincial funds were insufficient, and the thorough overhaul has not been carried out to date, resulting in a hundred holes and thousands of sores, and dangerous situations are numerous. The sea wall project funds used to be hundreds of thousands at every turn, divided into several types such as emergency repairs, monthly repairs, and annual repairs. In recent years, the provincial treasury has become increasingly exhausted, and the sea wall project funds have been reduced again and again. This year, austerity is implemented again. The Water Conservancy Bureau's sea wall project fee for the 24th year was 120,000 yuan for the whole year, but it was reduced to 61,600 yuan, which is almost half of the previous figure. The bureau was ordered last month to make a comprehensive allocation of the approved funds and give priority to the most dangerous sea wall project for construction. After consulting with the chief engineers of each section, the most dangerous sea wall project construction plan was formulated, and repeated requests were made to the Construction Department to send personnel to inspect and reassess it in order to allocate funds for construction. However, now that the spring flood season has arrived, due to excessive spring rain and particularly large tides, the dangerous sea walls in the Hangzhou-Pinghu section have been hit by huge waves and are in an extremely critical state. For example, cracks have been found in the foot of the sea wall at Du Zhiqi and other places in Section 2 of the section, and the sea wall body has also tilted, which is extremely dangerous. The earthen embankment outside the Beisha Guanyin Pond outside Qingtai Gate in Hangzhou has been washed away by the flood. The Guanghua area outside Wangjiang Gate is also being eroded by the wind and waves on the river surface, washing away dozens of feet of shoreline, and a part of the houses and fields have been submerged. The construction of a water diversion dam is urgently needed for defense. A telegram was sent yesterday to suggest that personnel be dispatched to inspect and allocate funds for construction as soon as possible to avoid unexpected disasters in the near future, causing a tragic flood disaster for the people of Zhejiang Province.

In Jiangxi, due to Guangxi's ban on rice exports, the local grain in western Guangdong is insufficient to meet its own needs. Normally, it relies on Wuzhou rice to supplement it. Recently, due to the restriction on Guangxi rice exports, the grain in the Xijiang River basin is in high demand. In Zhaoqing, grain boats have been berthing on the shore every day, and they are quickly purchased by rice merchants downstream. Therefore, Zhaoqing has no surplus of grain, and rice prices have risen sharply, several yuan more expensive per hundred catties than before. As for Huizhou and other places in the Dongjiang River source, foreign rice merchants have recently been purchasing rice, and the rice price in Heyuan County is rising day by day. Currently, local people are maintaining people's food supply and are submitting requests to the county authorities to ban rice exports in order to adjust the supply. Since the local grain in the inland rivers is insufficient, the cities are naturally affected. Last week, local rice could be bought for 12 catties per yuan, but now, due to the scarcity of local grain, only 9 catties of rice can be bought per yuan. In just ten days, each yuan of white rice has been reduced by 3 catties, and the hardship of the common people's lives can be imagined. Guangzhou is a trading port and can use foreign rice for adjustment, but recently the foreign exchange rate has risen, and each Hong Kong dollar is worth more than 1.5 yuan of Guangdong legal tender, so the price of foreign rice has also risen at the same time. In this way, the food supply in Guangdong is affected by the outside world at any time, and it is not enough to deal with the changes in the situation without developing inland agriculture.</p>
<p>Recognizing this, the authorities recently convened experts to study the Guangdong grain relief plan, with increasing rice production as the only way to solve the food panic. The method is roughly to be handled by region: In the Chaoshan area, the focus is on supervising the planting of miscellaneous grains; in Qiongyai and the southern road, in addition to large-scale grain production in the first, second, and third military reclamation areas at the same time, 10,000 acres of fields in Leizhou and Dongsha will be converted to two rice crops per year, and the rural areas of Xuxian will be revived so that all the original residents can return to farming; in the Guangzhou area, mulberry fields will be converted to rice fields. It is found that before the Republic of China, when the silk industry was prosperous, the six counties of Shunde, Zhongshan, Nanhai, Sanshui, Panyu, and Xinhui had a total of more than 1.2 million acres of mulberry fields. After the decline of Guangdong silk in the 14th year of the Republic of China, most of the mulberry fields were abandoned. Currently, in addition to a small number of miscellaneous grains, there are still more than 50 acres of mulberry fields, and more than 500,000 acres are wasteland. In the future, the government plans to implement a half-requisition and half-loan method to help the county people convert 500,000 acres of mulberry fields into rice fields. It is estimated that 2.5 million yuan will be raised for the conversion of rice fields and cultivation. In the future, the county government will be repaid annually from the landowners' income. As for the coastal sandy fields in various parts of the province, there are about 5 million acres. As usual, one crop is planted each year. If you want two crops a year to increase the harvest, you must force the landowners to build dikes to prevent water. In view of the local situation, the tenants can build it themselves, or requisition loans, or the government can lend money to hire workers to build it all. The above-mentioned grain relief plan will be included in the second phase of the three-year administration plan and implemented step by step. (March 16)</p>
<h3 id="e87">New Contributions from the Cotton Crop Chemistry Laboratory of Nantong College: Extracting Gasoline, Kerosene, and Diesel Oil from Cottonseeds, Yielding Excellent Efficiency for Automobiles and Machinery <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Nantong Correspondence: The Cotton Crop Chemistry Research Laboratory of Nantong College's Agricultural Science Department has been established for years, making numerous contributions to cotton chemistry research, and is highly regarded by all parties. The laboratory's equipment is also very complete, a rarity in the country. Recently, technician Dai Yijian from the laboratory has been experimenting with extracting various oils from cottonseed, achieving remarkable results. Xie Xiling, the department head, has allocated a substantial sum of one thousand yuan to purchase instruments and further expand the equipment. Wang Yaochen, the head of the Agronomy Department, has also initiated the organization of a Cotton Chemistry Research Society to promote the work. It has now been formally established, with participation from various professors and students, with Wang Yaochen as the director, Liu Xinfu as the manager, and Dai Yijian as the chief technician. A small factory has already been established, and a large factory is currently raising shares for establishment, with each share costing fifty yuan, all are free to participate. Once enough shares are collected, patent procedures are expected to be realized soon, and are currently underway. Yesterday, Dai Yijian summoned Tongyang Automobile Company's vehicle number 760 to publicly demonstrate the gasoline he extracted, and invited Department Head Xie, Professor Wang, and students Wang Yijin and Wang Zhen to participate. The vehicle traveled from the front of the school, passing Qixiu Bridge, the Girls' Normal School, and other places, before returning to the school from the West Park. The result was satisfactory, and the efficiency was better than ordinary gasoline. It is said that this gasoline is no less inferior than the high-grade gasoline sold on the market, and far surpasses the low-grade gasoline. In addition to gasoline, kerosene has also been produced, its luminosity is the same as Mobil oil, with no odor. Using the same large lamp head, within the same amount of time, every five CC burns one hour longer than Mobil oil. If calculated by a box, it can last up to three hundred hours longer. When tested in gasoline lamps, the efficiency is also the same as Mobil oil. Furthermore, there is diesel oil, which has been tested by the Quan Chang Machinery Factory in the West Park. According to the factory owner, its efficiency is much greater than that of diesel oil sold on the market, demonstrating its advantages. The raw materials are obtained from plants, providing an inexhaustible source, which is most economical. If mass production can be achieved in the future, it can not only stop leaks but also contribute to national defense. It is heard that Dai Yijian has been promoted from assistant instructor to lecturer.</p>

<p>Purchasing Overcoats Leads to Detention and Fine</p>
<p>Zhang Wenda, the township head of Jinshan County, a neighboring county, sent his brother Wenbin to Songjiang this morning (the 20th) to purchase overcoats for his family. He purchased three overcoats at Dashengxin Silk Shop in Liguan Post and carried them back to his hometown. While passing through Xujing Bridge in the third district of this city, he was suddenly arrested by a policeman, mistaken for theft. Despite the testimony of many tea drinkers at a teahouse, it was ineffective. He was taken to the third police station where patrol officer Guo Zhongxiu interrogated him, and without any explanation, considered him to be a thief. Even when a proof note from Dashengxin Silk Shop was presented, it was ignored and he was fined five yuan. A relative of Zhang Wenbin, Mr. Jia, went to visit him and was also beaten and detained for two hours before being released. It is said that Zhang Wenbin was also beaten.</p>

<p>Stone Masons Demand Wage Increase and Go on Strike</p>
<p>In Shanren Bridge and Stone Pier area of Mudu Township, Suzhou, most of the villagers make a living by quarrying Jiaoshan stone. There are more than 30 stone quarry owners in the area, employing more than 400 stone masons. Recently, 13 quarry owners contracted for bridge stone materials for the Muguang section of the Su-Fu Highway. The stone masons demanded that the quarry owners (i.e., the capitalists) increase wages, but failing to achieve their goal, a portion of the stone masons went on strike on the 18th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 19th, all 400 stone masons went on strike, prohibiting various stone merchants from transporting stone materials, the situation was very serious, and the order was also chaotic. Upon learning of the situation, the Mudu Township District Office immediately dispatched assistant Zhou Zenggeng to mediate. Because the labor and capital sides had diverging opinions, there was no way to stop it. Tang Heming, the township head of Jiaoshan, that afternoon, invited District Chief Wang of the district office, and 23 representatives of both labor and capital, including Jiang Shida, Mr. Lu, and Mr. Yin, to consult for opinions. After consultation, District Chief Wang tried to persuade them in detail, and after discussion until 8 PM, there was still no way to mediate. The provincial security team stationed in Shanren Bridge Township, in order to maintain local order, specially dispatched a platoon of soldiers to garrison. By 9 AM yesterday (the 20th), although some stone masons voluntarily returned to work, awaiting mediation, the majority refused to return to work and continued the strike. District Chief Wang went there for the second time and convened representatives from both sides and the town head and bailiffs at the town office to mediate again. In the afternoon, it was heard that the labor side had agreed to resume work first, awaiting mediation. It is expected that all workers will resume work today.</p>
<p>Large Group of Bandits Attempt to Rob but Are Captured</p>
<p>The Second District Water Police Detective Team received a tip-off that a large group of bandits, in groups of three to five, would be arriving in Suzhou from Shanghai on the 8:25 train to commit crimes. They immediately set out to guard and arrest them. At around 9 AM, they successfully apprehended Wu Wenxuan (28 years old, from Wuhu), Tang Haiqing (44 years old, from Hefei), Chen Desheng (40 years old, from Wuhu), and Li Huangshi (19 years old, from Nanjing) near the Duseng Bridge, and confiscated three handguns and 37 bullets from Li Huangshi. They immediately took them into custody for interrogation and are now pursuing the remaining accomplices.</p>
<p>Drunken Brawl Nearly Leads to Death</p>
<p>Wang Guoquan, the big pancake vendor from 69 Pishi Street, a Huizhou native, and his fellow townsman Li Linian, had a drink at the Gongxing Restaurant near the Shangenbo bus stop on Lindun Road at around 9 PM on the 19th. Both were slightly drunk and, due to a dispute over the store, got into a fight. Wang Guoquan smashed Li Linian's head with a bowl, causing him to bleed profusely and fall unconscious. Wang Guoquan was then taken to the First Public Security Station. Li Linian, due to severe injuries, was sent to the County Hospital for treatment. Yesterday (the 20th), the First Station transferred Wang Guoquan to the General Bureau for interrogation. Li Linian is still in critical condition due to excessive bleeding, and his life is very uncertain.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Police Chief Detained for Accepting Bribes</p>
<p>Chen Shaohua, the acting patrol officer of the Second Police Station in Houqiao, recently filed a complaint to the General Public Security Bureau accusing patrol chief Ge Yunpeng of sheltering gambling and accepting bribes. Patrol Chief Ge also filed a counter-complaint accusing Patrol Officer Chen of opening gambling dens and skimming profits. After receiving the report, Chief Chen of the Public Security Bureau immediately ordered Ge and Chen, as well as police officers Wang Qinglin, Qi Mingxuan, Chen Xiang, Yang Yaochao, and Chen Jinrong, and bribing villager Pu Fucheng to be brought in for questioning. Section Chief Tu opened the court and first questioned Ge Yunpeng, whose testimony was evasive. Next, Pu Fucheng was questioned and admitted to bribing Patrol Chief Ge with ten yuan. The next police officers Wang Qinglin, etc., also admitted to receiving one yuan each without hesitation. After verifying the confessions, Section Chief Tu prepared a document yesterday (the 20th) and transferred them to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Brothers Working Together Gain Unexpected Fortune</p>
<p>Tang Guirong, Guiyin, and Guiquan, three brothers from Zhouxin Township, near the third district, who reside in Zouzha Lane, are all farmers and live in poverty, making it difficult to survive. Guirong works as a handyman in a silk factory. A few days ago, Gen Guiquan came to the city together for some matter, and at around 5 PM in the evening, they returned home together with Guirong, all three brothers. While passing through Biandan Border in Yangdong Township, they suddenly saw two burly men in front of them, looking flustered, carrying two large reed bags, their behavior was suspicious. The three brothers followed closely behind, observing what was happening. The two burly men suddenly rushed into the mulberry fields to hide. Guirong and others bravely stepped forward and implemented a search and arrest. The two men fled in panic and managed to escape, only leaving behind two reed bags. At that time, it was already dark, and they did not know what was hidden inside. They took them home, and upon opening them, they were shocked to find countless five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender, in the form of tinfoil strips, tied into about twenty strips, and after carefully counting, there were a total of 50,000 yuan. According to general speculation, this huge sum of money must be stolen goods from some major robbery, abandoned by the bandits when they were forced to do so. Now, this matter has spread far and wide.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Attached Bandit Robs and Injures People</p>
<p>Lu Haiwan of Kazibridge, Xinfeng Town, outside Zhongshan Gate in Wuyi, received more than one hundred yuan in club money at the Shanghai Railway Station's dragon head room, which was discovered by bandits. At around 12 PM on the night of the 18th, three bandits suddenly entered through a hole dug behind the house and demanded silver dollars from the Zhou family. When the Zhou family refused, they used sharp blades to stab him three times, causing him to be injured and fall to the ground. They then wantonly searched and looted, taking away 180 yuan in hidden silver and clothing. Afterwards, the nearby police station was notified to pursue the bandits, but they had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Industry Opposes Tax Increase</p>
<p>The Soybean Cake Industry Association in this county is reacting strongly to the Financial Department's increase of the business tax on the industry from 0.2% to 0.5%. It has repeatedly joined forces with Wuxian Yingjiang and other places to petition the province to withdraw the order, but to no avail. Now, the Soybean Cake Industry Association in this county has sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to appeal to the Provincial Federation of Commerce, arguing that soybean cake is the only fertilizer for farmland. If the tax is increased, it would be tantamount to destroying the development of the countryside. Recently, Japanese merchants have been making cakes from soybeans from the Northeast in Qingdao and Dalian and selling them in South China, with the Japanese subsidizing 800 yuan per 10,000 catties. Our government, on the contrary, is increasing taxes, which is tantamount to suicide. The Soybean Cake business volume in this county reaches more than 300,000 yuan annually, but last year it was less than 200,000 yuan, already affected by foreign goods dumping. Each thousand yuan of soybean cake can earn five or six yuan, but if the tax reaches 0.5%, merchants will be unable to sustain themselves. After receiving the letter, the County Chamber of Commerce has forwarded it to the Provincial Federation of Commerce.</p>
<p>County Government Prohibits Incense Pilgrimages</p>
<p>Here, every year on the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, there is a grand incense pilgrimage outside the West Gate, with the Zushi Temple on Yushan Mountain as the destination. However, more than ten years ago, during a tourist rush, more than ten men and women were crushed to death in the city gate hole. Since then, incense pilgrimages have been banned as a precedent. Now that the third day of the third month is approaching, the county government has issued a notice to prohibit them, to be prepared. However, every year, despite the issuance of the notice, the grand incense pilgrimage still takes place as usual.</p>
<p>Measures for the Livelihood of Social Education Personnel</p>
<p>The Provincial Government has ordered all County People's Education Centers and Gymnasiums to be closed down, and all directors will be gathered in the province for training. However, the living expenses of the directors and social education personnel will also be terminated at the same time. Previously, a meeting was once held in Wuxi to petition the province for relief. Now, according to news from the province, all personnel going to receive training will be paid half of their original salary until the end of the training period. Those who fail the training will be given a dismissal allowance of one month's salary as a gesture of sympathy. As for the gymnasiums, there has been a change. Each county with an Administrative Supervisory Commissioner's Office will set up one gymnasium, but the annual expenses must not exceed 1,500 yuan. Although this news has been decided by the province, it has not yet been issued to the counties.</p>
<p>Jiading</p>
<p>Labor Service Actively Building Roads</p>
<p>Shigang Township in the First District, in compliance with orders, held National Labor Service, starting on March 18th, to build the Ganggou, Gongchao, Gangchao, and Gaixin roads. More than 400 strong men were fully mobilized. Jijiwang Town, Songyang Township, and Punan Township in the Second District jointly built the Jipu, Jiyang, Jihuang, Jihua, Yanpu, and Punan roads, also starting on March 18th, and were limited to be completed in 20 days.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Three Families Robbed in Succession at Erlibridge</p>
<p>At around 2 AM yesterday, in the Erlibridge area outside the East Gate of this city, more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived, armed with long guns, Mauser pistols, knives, sticks, and other weapons. They entered the Yuanxin Rice Shop there by digging through the door and looted wantonly. They stole 45 yuan in big currency, 76 cents in small currency, 36,000 copper coins, and 16 packs of cigarettes. Afterwards, they went to the Baoji Construction Company's accounting room on the Jiahu Highway to rob, stealing 13 silver dollars and 6 cents in small currency. Finally, they robbed the Luyuansheng Oil and Sauce Shop, losing 9 yuan and 5 cents in paper money, 46 cents in small currency, and more than 8,000 copper coins. The total value of the items robbed from the above three families was approximately 150 yuan. After the robbery, the bandits headed towards Sanlibridge.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Importance and Promotion of Literacy Movements (Part 1) - Section Chief of the Ministry of Education <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Lingxiu</p>
<p>1. The Importance of Literacy</p>
<p>The strength of a country is directly proportional to the level of knowledge of its people. To put it plainly, a strong country has a high level of national knowledge, while a weak country has a low level. Therefore, the level of national knowledge and the strength of a country are closely related. If we look at the world's major powers such as the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Japan, their level of national knowledge is very high, and their countries are also very strong, which is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>However, we know that to improve national knowledge, we must promote literacy, which is the tool for acquiring knowledge. Because literacy is the tool for acquiring knowledge, to obtain knowledge, one must be literate. Without literacy, one cannot obtain knowledge. Therefore, the world's major powers pay great attention to the "Literacy Movement", and there are also very many literate people. Almost everyone reads books and is literate. Take Germany for example, about ninety-nine out of every hundred people are literate, and only one person is illiterate. Therefore, after the European War, although it was a crushing defeat, in just over ten years, it has recovered. In addition, in countries such as France, Britain, the United States, and Japan, more than 90% of the people are literate, and only 1-2% or 3-4% are illiterate. Even in Russia, which is relatively backward in education, a few years ago, the illiteracy rate was still 70%. Since the success of the First Five-Year Plan, as a result of efforts in the Literacy Movement, the illiteracy rate is only 10%, and the literacy rate has reached over 90%. The remaining 10% of illiterates were expected to be eliminated in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan (1933). I think they have already done it. The reason why countries around the world pay attention to promoting the Literacy Movement is nothing more than to improve the people's intelligence, strengthen the nation, enrich national power, and strengthen the country.</p>
<p>Our China is known as a major country in East Asia, blessed by nature, with more than 4,000 years of culture, 4 million square miles of land, and a population of more than 400 million. However, more than 80% of the people are illiterate, and there are 300 million, accounting for three-quarters, which leads to low national knowledge, insufficient national power, and weak national strength. In the past century, all international and other ethnic negotiations have failed. In addition to losing land and paying reparations, various unequal treaties have been signed, falling into the position of a semi-colony. Since the "September 18th Incident", the four northeastern provinces have been lost again due to non-resistance. Let us think about why we have gotten to this point? It is because most people are illiterate: people's knowledge is low. Although there are 400 million people, it is no different from a sheet of loose sand, with weak unity and dispersed spirit. It is not as good as those with knowledge, unity, and training with small populations, so they can be motivated and achieve great things, and win more with less. Now, if we want to revitalize the national spirit, improve national knowledge, in order to save the crisis and revive the nation, we must promote the Literacy Movement and improve the knowledge of the people. This is how the interests of a literate and illiterate nation relate to the entire nation. Furthermore, in terms of personal relationships, the suffering of illiterate people is truly indescribable. Here are a few examples to illustrate: For example, illiterate people do not know the name and house number, so they do not know east and west, and north and south, which is so inconvenient. When he arrives at a dangerous place, even if there is a piece of paper pasted on it, clearly writing, "There is a tiger trap below, pedestrians should not approach" or "Beware of electric shock" and the like, but he has eyes but does not recognize the words, so he still approaches, inevitably facing danger, which is so terrible. On the outside of the medicine bottle, it is clearly written "For external use only, not for internal use", but because he is illiterate, he still gets it wrong and eats it wrong, which is so dangerous. When encountering important matters, if one needs to communicate with others, an illiterate person cannot write even if he has hands, so he must ask others, which is so pitiful. Asking others to write a letter cannot fully express his intentions, which is a small matter. Important private matters are known to others. This is so inconvenient. When using banknotes, illiterate people are often treated by others as if a one-yuan banknote counts as five or ten yuan banknotes, being fooled without knowing it, which is such a loss. As the saying goes: "If you are illiterate, you will suffer all kinds of grievances", which is absolutely true! In this way, the suffering of illiterate individuals and the harm to the entire country from the illiteracy of the majority of the people, affecting the strength of the country, are so closely related. It can be seen how important literacy is and how significant the meaning of the Literacy Movement is.</p>
<p>2. The Progress of the Literacy Movement</p>
<p>After the National Government took over Nanjing, it paid close attention to the Literacy Movement. Therefore, in the mass training passed by the Central Standing Committee on June 4, 1928, "Vigorously Promoting Literacy" was listed as a special item. By the October 25th, the 179th meeting of the Central Standing Committee resolved the outline of grassroots work, and the "Literacy Movement" was ranked first among the seven items, and a propaganda outline for the Literacy Movement was formulated. On February 13, 1929, the Ministry of Education promulgated a general outline of the literacy movement propaganda plan, ordering all provinces and cities across the country to carry out large-scale propaganda within the shortest possible time, in order to arouse the public's interest in seeking knowledge through literacy and reading. Since the promulgation of this "General Outline of the Propaganda Plan", the sound of the Literacy Movement has shaken the whole country, and the achievements of the Literacy Movement are also remarkable. The provinces and cities that have organized literacy movement propaganda committees in accordance with the general outline of the literacy movement propaganda plan promulgated by the Ministry of Education include: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Fujian, Yunnan, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jilin, Rehe, Chahar, Gansu, Shaanxi. The provinces of Ningxia and Suiyuan, and the cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Beiping, and Tianjin. Nearly a thousand counties and cities have organized and established them. Among them, the four provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Nanjing, and Shanghai have done a more perfect job, and the results are also the most obvious. The effects obtained after the various provinces and cities carried out literacy movement propaganda are as follows: (1) Adding more civil schools and literacy schools, with illiterate people actively enrolling. (2) Adding more public inquiry offices and public reading rooms. (3) Adding more public literacy plaques, newspaper reading plaques, and wall newspapers. (4) Increasing and promoting literacy funds. (5) The number of illiterate people is gradually decreasing. Among the above items, it is permissible that the number of public schools in various provinces and cities has increased greatly. Over the years, there has been progress, which is really the most fundamental method of the Literacy Movement and a very good phenomenon. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Education in 1928, the total number of public schools in the country in 1928 was 6,708, with 206,021 students. In 1929, there were 22,383 schools, with 887,642 students, an increase of 22,062 schools compared to 1928, an increase of more than four times, and the number of students increased by 693,039, an increase of three and a half times. In 1930, there were 29,302 schools, with 944,289 students, an increase of 3,929 schools compared to 1929, and an increase of 146,776 students. In 1931, there were 31,293 schools, with 1,062,161 students, an increase of 4,318 schools compared to 1930, and an increase of more than 117,800 students. In 1932, there were 34,141 schools, with 1,109,857 students, an increase of 2,841 schools compared to 1931, and an increase of 47,714 students. In 1933, there were 36,929 schools, with 1,292,672 students, an increase of 2,788 schools compared to 1932, and an increase of 18,280 students. As for the statistical materials for 1934, although they have not yet been collected completely, compared with 1933, there must be an increase, and it will not decrease. According to the above total, from 1928 to 1934, a total of 203,685 civil schools have been established, with a total of 6,795,314 students. This is the education that illiterate people have received since the promotion of the Literacy Movement. This is also a bit of achievement since the promotion of the Literacy Movement.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Upstream River Water Retreats to Two Inches: River Steamers Completely Blocked; Lowest Water Level in Recent Years; Goods Blocked and Unloaded in Hankou and Yichang <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The water of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, two weeks ago, shallow-draft river steamers could still barely pass, but in the past few days, the water level above Yichang has been falling daily. On the 15th of this month, the river water in the upper reaches fell below the bottom level, with only three inches of water, making it difficult for ships to navigate. Yesterday, Yichang sent another telegram, saying that the water level above Yichang had fallen again, with only two inches. Such a sharp drop is a record rarely seen in recent years.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Ships Halted</p>
<p>There are currently dozens of ships operating on the Sichuan River, including Minsheng, Taikoo, Ewo, and Sanbei. During this period of water reduction, they had already sent shallow-draft ships to load and unload goods upstream and downstream to maintain transportation. Unexpectedly, the river in the upper reaches has fallen to such a level that all Chinese and foreign river steamers, whether upstream or downstream, have been completely blocked and unable to pass since the 15th. All ships can only anchor and wait for the water level to rise before attempting to navigate.</p>
<p>All Goods Blocked</p>
<p>Goods transported to Sichuan include cotton yarn piece goods, domestic cloth shoes, towels, leather goods, toothbrushes, as well as nickel-plated machinery and equipment, etc., which are mostly blocked now, and cannot be transported. Those that have already been loaded have all been unloaded and stored in Hankou and Yichang. Therefore, the six companies have discussed raising the water freight for cotton yarn to the upper reaches, but it is still impossible to load. Moreover, Sichuan goods coming to Shanghai cannot pass through Yichang.</p>

<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that after arriving in Shanghai, the Taiwan Overseas Chinese Returning Home Inspection Group visited various cultural institutions in the city for inspection. They have now decided to take the early train to Hangzhou tomorrow, then proceed to Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Beijing, then to Hankou and Nanchang, and other places for a detailed inspection of the economic situation in the motherland. The Overseas Chinese Federation specially held a tea party at 3 PM yesterday at the YMCA Auditorium in Baixianqiao to welcome the entire delegation, along with over fifty people including Mr. Ye Xiasheng, Secretary-General of the Malayan Human Rights Advancement Association. Eloquent and impassioned speeches were given during the event. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included Mr. Lin Die, Mr. Huang Jianzhong, Mr. Xie Peinan, and Mr. Peng Shengtian, all directors of the Overseas Chinese Federation; Mr. Mao Yun from the Municipal Party Headquarters; Mr. Jiang Kanghu from the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association; Mr. Cui Tongde, a veteran member of the Revive China Society; the delegation members Mr. Lin Xiantang, Mr. Lin Jietang, Mr. Yang Zhaojia, Mr. Lin Ruiteng, Mr. Lin Gensheng, and Mr. Chen Binghuang; Mr. Ye Xiasheng (T. Hassan), Secretary-General of the Netherlands East Indies Malayan Human Rights Advancement Association; Mr. Xu Binghao, a leader of Koreans who have naturalized as Chinese citizens; and over fifty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Die delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today, the Overseas Chinese Federation is hosting the Taiwan Overseas Chinese Returning Home Inspection Group, and we are very pleased to have leaders from all walks of life participate. Since Taiwan was ceded forty-two years ago, the overseas Chinese compatriots in Taiwan have been extremely concerned about the progress of the motherland's politics, economy, and culture but have never had the opportunity to help. Recently, Mr. Lin Xiantang and others organized the *New People's News*, established the Cultural Association, and organized the People's Party and the Autonomy League, contacting overseas Chinese leaders in Taiwan to report news from the motherland to the five million people in Taiwan. Now, they are going even further, touring the motherland to report the situation of the motherland to the overseas Chinese. We are very grateful. We have prepared a simple tea to wish you good health," and so on. Then, Mr. Xie Peinan reported on the historical facts of the Taiwan revolution.</p>
<p>Lin and Yang's Reply</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Lin Xiantang, president of the Taiwan *New People's News*, gave a reply (translated by Xie Peinan due to language barriers), stating, "Since I returned to the motherland twenty years ago, I have never returned to the national gate. I have heard that the motherland has made great progress. I have long planned to organize an inspection group to return to the country so as to report to our compatriots in Taiwan. This time, I decided to return to the motherland with my colleagues. Seeing the cultural construction in Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places, it is far beyond what it was twenty years ago. We visited the municipal government the other day and felt even more vitality. Although we are living abroad, we are very concerned about the situation in the motherland. Now that we have decided to return to the motherland, we truly feel that 'hearing is not as good as seeing.' While in Taiwan, we only heard that progress was very rapid, but we did not know to what extent. In order to thoroughly understand the situation in the motherland, we have decided to travel to various villages in the north and south for inspection. Today, we arrived in Shanghai and are grateful for your hospitality," and so on. Next, Mr. Yang Zhaojia, chairman of the Taiwan Autonomy League, reported on the current situation in Taiwan: "The population is over five million, including over two hundred thousand Japanese, over ten thousand indigenous people, and the rest are all overseas Chinese compatriots. Eight out of ten overseas Chinese are engaged in agriculture, and the rest are engaged in industry and commerce. Therefore, the economic structure relies entirely on farmers, and economic strength depends on the prosperity or decline of agricultural harvests. The government's annual tax revenue is about 120 million yuan. Culturally, influenced by the East and the West, it has gradually developed. Children from farming families are also studying advanced topics, and specialists are emerging. In recent years, many talents have returned to the country for research. However, because politics is not in the hands of the overseas Chinese, technical talents are often unemployed, which leaves a very bad impression on the general public," and so on. Finally, Mr. Yang stated that he hoped that compatriots in the motherland would not mistake all Taiwanese people for the actions of vagrants from Taiwan in Fujian Province and other places, as these shameless vagrants are a very small minority of unintelligent individuals, and Taiwanese people have long despised them.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's Address</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Ye Xiasheng, Secretary-General of the Human Rights Advancement Association of the Dutch East Indies, from Malaya, was invited to speak. Mr. Ye has been working for revolution in the Dutch East Indies for decades and is highly respected by people in various territories in Southeast Asia. He is proficient in English, French, Japanese, German, Dutch, and Indian languages. This time, due to the Japanese incident, he traveled east to inquire and inspect, arriving in Shanghai earlier this week. He will soon go to Nanjing and then to Guangdong, Guangxi, and India for inspection. The association specially invited him to speak at the meeting. He initially planned to criticize the influence of Japanese political parties on China but later changed to discuss the relationship between Malaya and China. Mr. Ye was very humble and spoke in English, saying that English was not his native language and asked for forgiveness if he did not speak well. He then said that Java, Sumatra, and other places are all colonies, and China has been regarded as a quasi-colonial country. However, in our eyes, it is the leader of weak nations, so we hope to unite with each other," and so on (the following is omitted). The speech was passionate and moving. Mr. Ye wore a khaki suit, was short and wiry, with piercing eyes and a dark complexion, and one could tell at a glance that he was an experienced figure. Then, Mr. Xu Binghao and Mr. Mao Yun, a representative from the Municipal Party Headquarters, gave speeches. At 5:30 PM, tea and refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Departure for Hangzhou Tomorrow</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai on the 16th, the delegation visited the new municipal government construction, Jiaotong University, the *Shen Bao* and *News Daily* offices, and various cultural institutions. At noon yesterday, Cao Yunxiang, Li Denghui, Jiang Kanghu, and others hosted a welcoming banquet. In the afternoon, the Overseas Chinese Federation and others hosted a reception. At 8 PM last night, they visited the Star Film Company. At noon today, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association will host a welcoming banquet. They will take the early train to Hangzhou tomorrow, stay for a day or two, then proceed from Hangzhou to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Nanjing, then to Tianjin and Beijing. They will take the Pinghan Railway to Hankou, then to Nanchang, to inspect the rural areas in the bandit-suppressed areas after recovery, and then to Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces before returning to Taiwan.</p>

<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that, with spring plowing about to begin, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has allocated six million yuan to implement the seed loan program. The sixty-one counties in the province will be allocated relief funds based on the size of the county and the needs of the situation. The head office has drafted detailed measures and instructed all branches and offices to handle the matter within the possible scope. It is reported that the loans will begin with seed loans and will also include fertilizer loans and marketing loans. The aim is to work closely with farmers from sowing to harvest, so that farmers can directly cooperate with the Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>Loan Programs Over the Years Have Been Quite Satisfactory</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank was established in 1928 with an allocation of 3.6 million yuan from the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It is dedicated to regulating rural finance and developing agricultural production. It has also established a special agricultural product marketing office to sell agricultural products on behalf of farmers, purchase seeds and fertilizers on their behalf, and provide cooperative market information. Over the years, it has worked closely with farmers throughout the province and has been trusted and satisfied by all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Six Million Yuan for Seed Loans</p>
<p>In order to increase agricultural production for farmers throughout the province, the bank has approved the allocation of six million yuan to implement the seed loan program at a meeting of directors and supervisors. Loans will begin at the time of spring plowing, and the purchase of fertilizers and all other expenses required for agricultural operations in the future will be covered. The head office has drafted detailed loan measures and instructed all branches and offices to investigate the needs of each county and provide as much relief as possible.</p>
<p>Average Allocation to Sixty-One Counties</p>
<p>The bank's loan program covers the entire province. This year, all sixty-one counties in the province will be allocated funds based on actual needs, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to over 100,000 yuan per county. The bank has established eighteen branches in Shanghai, Nanjing, Danyang, Gaochun, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Changshu, Kunshan, Qingpu, Jiading, Songjiang, Rugao, Yancheng, Xuzhou, and Qingjiang; four sub-branches in Yixing, Jintan, Liyang, and Suqian; fourteen offices in Shuyang, Lianshui, Fengxian, Nanhui, Taixing, Baoying, Jinshan, Zhenze, Taicang, Baoshan, Xinghua, Funing, Chuansha, and Dongtai; and seven agency offices in Benniu, Lücheng, Meili, Heqiao, Anfeng, Jiangyan, and Hexing. Together with the Zhenjiang head office, there are a total of forty-four offices. In the past, there was one office in each county, as the borders of neighboring counties were easily accessible, so no additional agency offices were established. This year, it has been decided to establish offices in each county to make it more accessible.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Remaining Amount of Shaanxi Relief Bonds; Continued Cash Redemption at Banks; Remaining 100,000 Yuan Pledged at 60% for Cash Loan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The *Shen Shi News* reports that the central government allocated 500,000 yuan of relief bonds to Shaanxi Province for disaster relief in northern Shaanxi. Zhao Shouyu, commissioned by the Shaanxi Provincial Government, went to Beijing to collect the bonds and came to Shanghai to negotiate cash redemption with the banking community in the city for urgent use in spring relief efforts. The Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications accepted the bonds at 60% of their face value of 400,000 yuan, totaling a cash loan of 240,000 yuan. The contract was taken back by Zhao, and Shao Lizhi, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, and the Xi'an branch of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications signed the contract in Xi'an on the 15th. This cash loan was directly transferred by the Shaanxi branch to the Shaanxi Provincial Government for disbursement, with part of it used to purchase food for emergency relief, and another part used to develop industries in northern Shaanxi, so as to achieve the effect of work-for-relief. However, due to the wide scope of the disaster and the shortage of funds, the allocation is still insufficient. Therefore, the remaining 100,000 yuan of relief bonds have been continuously pledged at 60% to the Shaanxi branches of the Shanghai Jin City Bank and the Communications Bank, following the method of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. It is now heard that an agreement has been reached, and Chairman Shao specially telegraphed Yan Zhuang, the Shaanxi Supervisory Committee member staying in Shanghai, yesterday, instructing him to contact the authorities of the Shanghai Jin City Bank and Communications Bank head offices to sign the contract and disburse the relief funds as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The *Ta Kung Pao* reports that the second session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee elected by the Third National Congress of the National Postal Workers' Union (*name list omitted in report*) took the oath of office at 10 AM yesterday. At the same time, the first joint meeting of the second session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee was convened. In the afternoon, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union held an entertainment party at the Congress venue to welcome the representatives of the Third National Congress of the General Union. In addition to all the representatives, many people from all walks of life attended. The union's secretary-general, Mr. Zhao Shusheng, and Ms. Ding Shunhua, held their wedding ceremony at the same time and place. The wedding officiants were the presidium of the Congress, which was especially rare. Therefore, there was a bustling scene with many guests, making it a fine story in the history of the postal workers' movement.</p>
<p>Oath of Office On the morning of yesterday, at 9 AM, all the representatives of the union convened a discussion meeting in the Ningbo Fellow Association Hall on the fourth floor of the Congress venue, exchanging views on the results of this Congress meeting and the future direction. At 11 AM, the first joint meeting of the second session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee was convened, with thirty-two committee members present, twelve committee members in attendance, and six representatives in attendance.

If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the most severe sanctions from postal workers nationwide. We solemnly swear." After the oath, the chairman delivered the opening remarks, stating, "Today is the day when all the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the second session of the National Postal Workers' Union take office. We have been entrusted by postal workers nationwide and bear this arduous task. At a time when the national crisis is imminent, the importance of our mission is self-evident. I believe that everyone will be able to display their talents and contribute their great plans to jointly promote the postal workers' movement and the construction of postal workers' welfare undertakings. National affairs and postal transport rely on this," and so on. After the remarks, the discussion began. Standing Committee members of the Executive and Supervisory Committee were elected, including nine Standing Committee members of the Executive Committee: Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Yinghua, Zhao Shusheng, Wang Yisheng, Zhang Kechang, Chen Shigao, Cao Jiaxiu, and Wei Desen; and three Standing Committee members of the Supervisory Committee: Chen Zuqing, Wang Kai, and Xia Junrui.

As the Congress has closed, most of the representatives from various places, except for a few who had already departed the day before yesterday, are scheduled to return home today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Flour Inspection by the Commodity Inspection Bureau; After the Meeting Concluded, Compiled and Submitted Improvement Suggestions to the Ministry for Implementation <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Technology Research Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to improve the flour inspection methods, specially convened representatives from Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, and Shanghai on the 16th of this month to hold a meeting at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. The meeting concluded on the 19th. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Jiang Gongchen, a technician from the Flour Inspection Group of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. According to him, China has been implementing flour inspection for nearly a year, and the results are still good. This meeting was to inquire about the inspection process in various places, the points that need to be improved, and to unify the standards in various places. The results of the meeting have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval and implementation. The current inspection standards and the opinions of various bureaus on the modifications to be made are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Current Standards</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce stipulates the following standards for qualified flour: * Appearance: white or slightly yellow, must not have any foreign odor or * condition, and must not contain parasites. * Impurities: must not contain the following impurities: (A) Stone powder, chalk, alum, copper sulfate, and other substances harmful to health; (B) Seeds of poisonous plants and flour made from diseased wheat such as ergot; (C) Other starchy flours. * Fineness: the residue that cannot pass through a sieve with 42 holes per square centimeter must not exceed 0.20%. * Moisture: must not exceed 15%. * Crude Fiber: must not exceed 0.50%. * Ash Content: must not exceed 1%.</p>
<p>Modification Suggestions</p>
<p>The Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau's proposed modifications to the current flour inspection standards: * Appearance: to be modified to "must not have a foul odor or moldy condition and must not contain parasites"; the words "white or slightly yellow" are to be deleted. * Impurities: to remain as originally specified. * Fineness: to be deleted. * Moisture: to remain as originally specified, "must not exceed 15%." * Crude Fiber: no restrictions to be added; the amount is only to be used as a basis for grading. * Ash Content: to be specified as "must not exceed 2%." * Nitrogen Content: to be specified as "must not be less than 1.25%." * Acidity: not to be added. * Other items such as cold water soluble matter, fat dry gluten, and starch sugar should not be added. The purpose of inspection is clearly defined in the Commodity Inspection Law, and components that are irrelevant to the inspection purpose or are redundant should not be specified. The Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau's proposals for modifying the current standards: * The inspection of crude fiber consumes the most time and requires constant attention, preventing the inspector from leaving even a step. The amount of crude fiber in flour is negligible. The crude fiber we ingest from vegetables and fruits daily exceeds the crude fiber in flour by hundreds of times. The flour inspection rules stipulate that crude fiber must not exceed 0.5%, which seems to be of little significance from a health perspective. If it is said that there are too many remaining grains, then the ash content is sufficient as evidence. Therefore, it is proposed to cancel the inspection of crude fiber. * The inspection of acidity can detect whether the flour is rancid. The acidity of ordinary flour, in terms of lactic acid, is usually below 0.25%. The measurement of flour acidity is easy and significant, which is in line with the principles of commodity inspection. Therefore, it is proposed to add this inspection. * The fineness item may be retained as a test for grading, as there are many coarse flours sold on the market. If fineness is prevented, then coarse flours, which contain more comprehensive nutrients, cannot be sold on the market. The Hankou Commodity Bureau's proposal is that the amount of protein contained in flour is greatly related to the quality. The current flour inspection standards should add an item for protein inspection. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's modification suggestions: * Moisture: The current standard is considered appropriate and should not be modified. * Ash Content: If whole wheat flour and similar products are not included in the flour inspection, then there is no need to revise or relax the current ash content standard. * Crude Fiber: This standard is still applicable and should not be modified. * Fineness: This standard is very problematic. If the majority advocates exemption, it should be supported. If the original standard is maintained, then the size of the sieving equipment, the operation time, etc. should be precisely specified in order to avoid the drawbacks of different inspection results in various bureaus. The Shanghai Bureau has a set of self-made sieving equipment, which can be submitted for discussion at the small group meeting. * Acidity: It is proposed to add this item, as flour inspection focuses on quality. The current item for condition mainly uses eyesight, touch, or smell to judge, which is difficult to perfect. Adding the acidity item can remedy part of the shortcomings. * Other items: It is proposed not to list many other items in the hope of achieving the goal of rapid inspection procedures and accurate standards.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Guangdong Reduces Tax on Domestic Bran, Transportation Merchants Resume Transport, From 25 Cents to 15 Cents per Load, Oil Mills and Transportation Merchants Cease Operations, Suffering Significant Losses <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice Press, after the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry strived to abolish the additional bran tax levied by Guangdong merchants, they jointly petitioned the Beijing-Nanjing authorities nationwide. Simultaneously, oil mills ceased operations, and transportation merchants halted transport. Now, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association has received a telegram from Qu Fangpu, Special Commissioner of Finance of Guangdong Province, stating that the Southwest Political Affairs Committee has approved a reduction in the additional tax on domestic bran from 25 cents to 15 cents per load. However, the additional tax on foreign bran will remain at 25 cents per load. Transportation merchants in various regions have now resumed transporting soybean cakes and other products to Guangdong Province. A New Voice Press reporter interviewed Mr. Gu Xinyi yesterday morning. According to him, although the Guangdong Provincial bran surtax has been reduced to 15 cents per load as informed by Special Commissioner Qu, no official document has been received. This decision was the result of striving to abolish the bran surtax, which led to a two-month shutdown of oil mills and a four-month cessation of transport by transportation merchants, resulting in significant losses.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Old Friend of Sun Yat-sen, Lin Yishun, Passed Away Yesterday <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Telegrams have been sent to his family to come to Shanghai to manage funeral affairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yishun, a veteran revolutionary, old friend of Sun Yat-sen, prominent overseas Chinese businessman from Nanyang, and a native of Fujian, came north this time for discussions. However, after arriving in Shanghai, he suddenly contracted a stomach ailment and passed away at 11:30 PM last night at the Binlong Hospital on Baker Road. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Mr. Lin: Mr. Lin, courtesy name Fachu, was over sixty years old and a prominent overseas Chinese businessman in Nanyang. Thirty years ago, he advocated revolution with Sun Yat-sen, providing extensive financial support. Therefore, he had a close friendship with Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Lin resided in Singapore and previously served as Chairman of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, founder of the Overseas Chinese Bank, and General Manager of the Overseas Chinese Insurance Company.</p>
<p>Mission to the North: Recently, Mr. Lin, seeing the increasing national crisis and seeking to promote sincere unity, resolutely traveled north as a private individual. He arrived in Shanghai on the 13th of this month and stayed in Room 603 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road. Those who accompanied Lin included Zhang Yongfu and Feng Ziyou.</p>

<h3 id="e108">National Mining Association Petitions for Tax Reduction to Balance Market Prices <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Submits Two Points, Requesting the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to Negotiate</p>
<p>Sends Letters to Various Mining Companies to Solicit Opinions on Tax Reduction</p>
<p>The Mining Association of the Republic of China, considering that foreign coal is being dumped on the market, making it difficult for domestic coal to sustain itself, and that prices are inconsistent and mining taxes are very high, making it difficult to compete, has submitted a special petition to the Ministry of Industry requesting that a standard market price be set and requesting the Ministry of Finance to approve a reduction in mining taxes. It has also sent letters to various mines to solicit opinions. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Petition for Tax Reduction</p>
<p>Revision of Market Prices</p>
<p>The association's submission to the Ministry of Industry stated, "A submission regarding the request to reduce the mining tax rate on coal and to revise the standard market price. It is proposed that the Ministry take charge and negotiate directly with the Ministry of Finance to handle the matter in order to maintain the mining industry. We beseech your consideration."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's notification Kuang Zi No. 13728 stated, "It has been found that the association's request to reduce the mining tax rate on coal year by year has already been consulted with the Ministry of Finance for verification and handling, and instructions have been issued to inform. The Ministry of Finance has now replied that this case was previously submitted directly by the association and has already been clearly instructed, ordering that it be examined," etc.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance's approval Shui Zi No. 8556 stated, "Received the submission. It has been found that this Ministry levies a 5% tax on coal mining products, which has not exceeded the scope of the Mining Law. Based on the current tax payment situation of various coal mines, the highest tax paid is no more than 45 cents per ton, and the lowest is only 12 cents. Compared with the previous mining and mining taxes levied simultaneously by the Beijing Ministry of Finance, the burden has been significantly reduced. Furthermore, in recent years, this Ministry has made continuous improvements to mining taxes. For example, since 1933, all mines that have been charged transit taxes by customs have been allowed to be refunded under the mining tax item. In July 1934, the export tax paid on coal sold overseas was allowed to be refunded from the original mining tax. Recently, the customs transit tax on goods that have already paid the mining tax has been directly exempted to alleviate the difficult procedures for tax payment and refunds and the pain of capital immobilization. All of these measures are intended to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants and support industrial development. Now that the burden on mining merchants has gradually been reduced, and the import tax on coal imported from outside the customs has been repeatedly increased, it is sufficient to protect the domestic coal mining industry. The association's request to reduce the mining tax rate on coal year by year is not deemed necessary in the current situation. If the situation changes in the future and tax reduction is necessary, it will be considered and handled at any time," etc.</p>
<p>The association received these notifications one after another and listed them on the agenda of the 23rd Annual General Meeting of Members held on the 29th of last month. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the mining law originally listed the coal category of the mining tax rate, but did not clearly specify it. The Ministry of Finance's levy of 5% belongs to a unilateral estimate, and based on the current tax payment situation of various coal mines, there are differences in the amount, which shows that the collecting agency can arbitrarily adjust it up or down. The association's previous request for annual reduction method was to show the government's protection policy for coal mines within the customs, and to maintain them in many ways. However, considering the central government's financial difficulties, the above should be taken into account, so it was a compromise request for change. Now, according to the Ministry of Finance's approval, the current coal tax varies in amount, and the tax collecting agency itself is already not good. The various coal mines have been suffering from hidden and apparent burdens for a long time. Only a fundamental solution can eliminate abuses and lighten the burden. The association should continue to request based on the original principles and reasons, and strive to achieve the lowest tax rate and fair treatment."</p>
<p>The representatives of various mines attending the annual general meeting included Luan, Zhongxing, Zhongfu, Huadong, Datong, Le, Liuhegou, Hanyeping, Jinbei, Baopuyi, Xingbao, Tianyuan, Qiugou, and Changxing, etc. from fifteen companies. The hope for improvement of the coal tax is indeed from the real situation. The association is entrusted by the members of various mines and dares not not work hard to seek it. However, the meaning of the Ministry of Finance's previous approvals is not without consideration, but because national taxes are involved, it is unwilling to change easily. It is estimated that relying solely on empty words is difficult to succeed. It is found that the Ministry of Industry stated in December last year that minerals are the mother of industrial raw materials, so developing the mining industry is an important plan to promote material construction. In recent years, although the number of newly emerging mines in the country has increased annually, they have not been actively developed in practice. Even the previously established mines have not been fully developed. All of the above situations have many reasons. It is specifically notified to various mines that if there are any difficulties or obstacles in the business operations, they should be stated in detail, and all possible efforts will be made within the scope of their duties to assist in the progress. This shows the Ministry of Industry's intention to maintain the mining industry and plan deeply. Currently, the market is not prosperous, and the situation is still serious. The sales of coal from various mines fluctuate, and there are many difficulties in business operations. When everyone is jointly trying to reduce costs, it is extremely necessary to reduce coal taxes. After thinking again and again, the only thing that can be done is to ask the Ministry to adjudicate and order the review of the original case repeatedly submitted by the association, and to conduct sincere consultations with the Ministry of Finance to take into account both sides, and strive to achieve the two principles originally submitted by the association: Coal is the cheapest item and should be levied according to the lowest tax rate of 2% in Article 93 of the Mining Law. The market price of coal should be based on the total quantity of actual sales prices of various goods of the same type produced by a mine in the market closest to the mine, divided by the price per unit quantity. Give it to them for selection, clearly stipulate it, and promulgate and implement it with a single law. The Ministry of Industry presides over justice and strives for fairness, and will surely be able to obtain a fundamental solution, benefit the mining industry, and be of immeasurable virtue. The reason is that a written submission has been made, and we beseech your inspection and handling, and await orders with extreme trepidation. Respectfully submitted to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Separate Letters to Various Mines</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions</p>
<p>The association sent separate letters to all member coal mining companies yesterday, soliciting information on the need for tax relief for each mine. The original letter stated, "It has been found that the Ministry of Finance has approved the request to clearly stipulate the mining tax rate for coal and the standard market price. It was approved in September last year that the central government's finances are extremely difficult. The mining industry should be maintained, and tax revenue should also be taken into account. The 14th Board of Directors Meeting of the association, with this in mind, decided to continue to request that the coal tax rate be reduced to 4% from 1936, 3% in 1937, and 2% by 1938. It was approved last month that this is not necessary in the current situation. If the situation changes in the future and tax reduction is necessary, it will be considered and handled at any time. It was brought up for discussion at the 23rd Annual General Meeting of Members of the association on the 29th. It was resolved that the association should continue to request and also send letters to the member coal mines to submit their actual situation to the Ministry of Industry for complaint and record. The association is aware of the Ministry of Finance's repeated approval intentions. Relying solely on empty words will have no results. Therefore, it has been decided to base on the two principles of the original request and submit them to the Ministry of Industry for sincere consultation in order to obtain a solution. The Ministry of Industry's authorities are eager to assist various mines and issued a special notice in December last year. Your company should investigate and deliberate on the situation of the need for tax relief in the mine, and submit it to the Ministry of Industry for earnest complaint and request, and also send the original submission to the association for consultation. In this way, with everyone working together, the effect can be expected. I hope you will instruct me. In addition to sending separate letters, I am specially sending this letter for your information. Please reply as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Fishing Protection Office Sends Warships to Protect Fishing <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi Press, the spring fishing season is approaching, and the large pairs of fishing boats from various gangs have set off for the waters around Qingbin Miaozi Lake to catch small yellow croaker. If another half month passes, the large pairs of fishing boats will gather in the waters of North Snake Mountain to capture the peak wind (the peak period of small yellow croaker). The fishermen's livelihood for the whole year depends on the harvest of this season. Protection and patrol are not to be delayed. The Fishing Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry has ordered the Haihong, Haigou, Biaohai, and Haiying warships to depart separately to protect the areas in accordance with regulations. Haihong is responsible for patrolling the areas of Shenjiamen, Daishan, Changtu, and Putuo. Haigou is responsible for patrolling the areas of Majishan and Shenshan. Biaohai is responsible for patrolling Chongming. Haiying is responsible for patrolling Wenzhou, Shipu, and Shenjiamen. However, the fishing areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are vast, and the existing four warships are not enough. Therefore, the Yong Fishing Police Bureau has been consulted to order the Kewei and Keqiang fishing protection warships to coordinate patrols to ensure thoroughness.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Ratepayers Association Requests the Municipal Council to Correct the Electric Power Company's Action Without Evidence <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ratepayers Association of Chinese Residents wrote to the Secretary-General of the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, "It is alleged that, according to the letter from Chunji Manager, the Electric Power Company had written to the Municipal Council asking it to investigate the meter issue and the Municipal Council replied that their shop had tampered with the meter without permission, and that the shop had sent a representative to promise to pay the fine, so no is needed. The shop was surprised to hear of this. The meter is the property of the Electric Power Company, and they are not electrical experts, so they have no way of knowing whether it is damaged or not, nor do they know whether the meter was good or bad or whether it was calibrated accurately when the company installed it five years ago. They only know that there were lead seals at the wiring points to prevent electricity theft, and there were also similar lead seals on the meter casing to prevent users from tampering with it. In addition to investigators from the company visiting their shop from time to time to check for damage to the lead seals, there are also meter readers who record the amount of electricity used every month. The company's prevention is very strict. If a user accidentally damages the lead seal, they could have sued in court at that time, but they delayed until now, after removing the old meter and installing a new one. Two days later, they said that the old meter was damaged internally and calculated the fine from the date of installation. Even if the meter was damaged internally, how do they know that it was damaged from the date of installation? Is there any factual basis for this? If there was such a fact, the investigators, meter readers, and even the craftsmen who removed the meter did not mention it at all in the past five years. On the contrary, it is the company's fabrication. It is not based on reason or logic. If the meter was slow, the company should be responsible for it, because the meter was not calibrated when it was installed. As for the shop's promise to pay the money, it was because the company knew that the shop could not operate without electricity, so it threatened to cut off the power. The shop had no choice but to admit that it would temporarily pay the money on time as a guarantee, and would appeal to resolve this unfortunate event. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Council did not handle it with a fair responsibility, but sided with the Electric Power Company, making the taxpayers regret it. It should be known that cutting off the power is like holding someone's throat and preventing them from breathing. When breathing is blocked, life is cut off. When the power is cut off, the shop closes. No one under such coercion will not temporarily relieve the pressure of the other party and gradually seek the rescue of justice. The shop's recognition of the temporary payment of security money is for this reason. Therefore, I am writing again to ask your association to ask the Municipal Council to correct the company's action without reason." "The Electric Power Company's illegal actions of self-investigation, self-trial, and self-execution are appreciated."</p>

<h3 id="e113">China Foreign Famine Relief General Association, Report on the Situation in the Disaster Area of Western Shandong <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the Yellow River breached its banks at Dongzhuang, and the floodwaters flowed directly southeast, inundating dozens of counties in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. The extent of the disaster area and the number of victims were unprecedented. The China Foreign Famine Relief General Association at 505 Henan Road, Shanghai, recognizing the severity of the situation, urgently needed to find ways to provide relief. It immediately submitted a report to the Ministry of Interior, requesting to hold a fundraising and relief campaign. Letters and telegrams were sent to various sectors at home and abroad to appeal for donations. The results were very good, and many people who were on the verge of death were able to survive. Recently, the disaster area has been greatly damaged, and there is no hope for spring plowing. It is planned to organize spring relief to continue to provide assistance. Ji Luyi, who was dispatched to Jining to handle emergency relief, was specifically instructed to report on the current disaster situation in western Shandong in order to consider the allocation. According to the report, the floodwaters in the disaster area are gradually receding. However, because the Yellow River water contains a lot of heavy mud, there is still a lot of mud on the ground after it recedes, ranging from several inches to several feet. Although the mud is fertile, wheat can be planted in shallow areas. However, the victims are extremely poor and cannot borrow one yuan even with a monthly interest rate of 10%. Land prices have fallen to one-quarter of what they used to be, but no one is interested. The dismantled beams and wood cannot be sold anywhere. The general food is sorghum paste, and some people grind cottonseed into flour and cook porridge to fill their stomachs. Nutritious foods such as eggs, meat, and vegetables have not been seen for months. Many victims are suffering from measles, pneumonia, septicemia, smallpox, and typhoid fever, etc., which are caused by malnutrition. Chairman Han of Shandong Province transported 300,000 victims out of the disaster area, and all of them were taken in by counties without disasters. It is now planned to send them back to their original places of origin. However, all the houses in the disaster area have been destroyed, and there is no food to be found. Even if there is a little sorghum, it has already been eaten by the victims who did not flee the disaster. The problem of housing and food is difficult to solve. Moreover, the mud is deep and difficult to travel through. It will also be difficult to transport food in the future. Work relief needs to be delayed for some time before it can be organized.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Broken Auxiliary Coins Cannot Be Exchanged, Yichang Chamber of Commerce Asks for an Early Solution <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a public letter from the Yichang County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, "The auxiliary coin coupons are intended to increase trade capital and liven up the market's finance so that legal tender can be converted into small denominations to meet the needs of the social economy. If used improperly, the consequences can be disastrous, affecting the national economy and the people's livelihood, which is no small matter. The types of auxiliary coin coupons circulating in the market are uneven, the most common being those of the Farmers Bank and the Hubei Provincial Bank, followed by those issued by the Central Bank and the Farmers and Workers Bank. Because the Farmers Bank and the Hubei Provincial Bank have branches, there is still a chance to exchange broken auxiliary coin coupons. However, once the auxiliary coin coupons of the Central Bank and the Farmers and Workers Bank are broken, they become waste paper, and all banks refuse to accept them. Over time, merchants suffer losses that are very large. Moreover, the above-mentioned auxiliary coin coupons cannot be exchanged by the banks themselves. With repeated use, the credit is gradually depreciating. Based on the principle of bad money driving out good money, copper coins are drying up and fleeing to various counties and towns. Urban paper money is rampant, and small transactions are extremely difficult. This not only fails to increase trade capital and liven up finance, but also affects the economic organization of urban and rural areas, which is contrary to the original purpose of auxiliary coin coupons. At this time of market closure, there are repeated disputes over the settlement of payments, and the future is uncertain, which is worrying. As far as the association can see, it is proposed that the government implement a currency management policy for auxiliary coin coupons, without allowing unlimited issuance, and should entrust local banks to exchange broken ones and remit them to other places so that credit can be consolidated and the people can benefit. The matter was submitted to the 15th Standing Committee meeting of the association for discussion, and it was resolved to submit a letter to the competent superior authorities and chambers of commerce at all levels to request financial assistance, etc., which was recorded in the minutes. On January 23 of this year, a letter was sent to the Hubei Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce for review. On February 24 of this year, a reply was received stating that the association's letter stated that the auxiliary coin coupons of the Hankou Farmers and Workers Bank were often broken and could not be used, and requested to find a way to exchange them. A letter was forwarded and recorded. The Farmers and Workers Bank's reply Gongzi No. 136 stated that the association's letter of the 5th of this month was received, stating that the Yichang County Chamber of Commerce stated that the auxiliary coin coupons issued by the bank were often broken and could not be used, and requested to find a way to exchange them to facilitate commercial use. It is known that the reserve and treasury notes of the bank will now be handed over to the Central Bank for receipt as stipulated by the Ministry. All exchanges of the above-mentioned broken banknotes should be handled by the Central Preparatory Committee. I believe that the committee will have concrete measures for collecting and exchanging broken banknotes in the near future and will inform them after receiving the notification. Therefore, I am writing to reply first. Please check and inform them. Up to now, the Farmers and Workers Bank has not received concrete measures for collecting and exchanging broken banknotes. For this reason, I am writing to your association again. Please check and forward it to the Central Preparatory Committee to determine the method of collecting the corner tickets of the Farmers and Workers Bank as soon as possible and inform the association so that all industries can follow. To a friendly society,"</p>

<p>Shanghai Bar Association members Shi Chang and Yu Ting, two lawyers, published legal advertisements in various newspapers for their clients but did not use their lawyer names. Instead, they used names such as "Ya Fu" and "Yu Junba." The association believes that this is related to lawyer ethics. After being submitted to a joint meeting of executive members, it was resolved that the association should send letters to the Yu members, prohibiting them from using aliases to publish advertisements for their clients to avoid misunderstandings. In the future, all lawyers representing clients in advertisements must use the names on their lawyer certificates to uphold lawyer ethics.</p>

<p>Buddhist Monk Performs Dance to Drive Away Demons</p>
<p>Datong News Agency: The Ceylon Study Group organized by the Buddhist Association of China is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 24th of this month. The group currently has five members. The swearing-in ceremony was held at the Jueyuan on Hed Road the day before yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Swearing-in Ceremony</p>
<p>The group held a swearing-in ceremony at the Jueyuan on Hed Road. Those present included Reverend Taixu, Jingquan, Dabei, Buddhist Monk Dishiming, Ananda, and Qu Wenliu, Zhao Puchu, and over fifty others. First, Reverend Taixu delivered a speech. Then, Buddhist Monk Dishiming and Ananda performed a Tibetan tantric demon-repelling dance and delivered farewell speeches (recorded separately). Finally, the swearing-in ceremony was held, with Taixu, Jingquan, and Dabei serving as witnesses. The ceremony concluded, and the attendees dispersed.</p>
<p>Buddhist Monk's Speech</p>
<p>The farewell speech of Buddhist Monk Dishiming is recorded below: Gentlemen, today you are going to Ceylon to study Buddhism, which can be called a great undertaking to revitalize Buddhism in China. I am very pleased. However, there are many difficulties in seeking the Dharma. The dance we performed is intended to drive away both visible and invisible demons for you who are going to Ceylon. In the past, I stayed in Ceylon for two years and know that the island is hot. Monks do not eat after noon and beg for alms on the streets to make a living. Foreign Buddhists who come to the island for the first time often feel uncomfortable. When you encounter this, you should treat it as nothing. There is no other reason for this, because you have an indomitable spirit. You have the ambition to establish the Sangha and continue the lineage of teachers of humans and gods. Your ambition and actions are grand and great. I wish you a safe journey ahead.</p>
<p>Scheduled Departure</p>
<p>The current members of the group are Song, Fazhou, Weihuan, Weizhi, and Xiu. They are scheduled to leave by boat on the 24th of this month and go directly to the Jin Gang Jing She in Colombo, Ceylon, to study Southern Buddhism and the rules of the Sangha. The study period is set at five years. During this period, they will practice begging for alms every day and study diligently. After arriving in that country, daily life will be taken care of by the Venerable Narada, who previously came to Shanghai to preach.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the China Construction Bank has been in operation for nearly three years. Thanks to the dedicated management of Chairman Kong Yongzhi, General Manager Song Ziliang, and Associate Manager Yang Desen, all aspects of its business have been developing rapidly. At the end of the 24th year, the total annual income reached more than 1,376,500 yuan. The income and expenditure were offset, and the net profit was more than 1,211,900 yuan. The prosperity of the business is evident. According to a report by a reporter from Xinxin News Agency, the company's business plan for this year will continue to follow the original policy, adhering to the spirit of consolidating its own foundation internally and establishing a good reputation externally, striving to assist in the development of various domestic construction projects, and paying attention to the provision of loans to industrial and commercial enterprises and rural areas for the sake of revitalizing industry and commerce and relieving rural areas. It is also learned that due to the booming business, the original site is no longer sufficient for use. Therefore, the company spent 1.5 million yuan to purchase land from the China General Chamber of Commerce and build a 19-story building at 181 Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. It has now been completed and is scheduled to move into the new building for business on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Postal Bureau Robbery Case Public Works Department Files Appeal Requests Capital Punishment for Monk Wukong Yesterday's Hearing Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of September 9th of last year, the General Post Office placed more than 91,900 yuan in banknotes into sacks, assigned people to carry them from the accounting room of the bureau on North Sichuan Road to the open space in the courtyard, and loaded them into a car to be transported to the Huiye Bureau. At this time, many robbers suddenly appeared, each holding a pistol, and opened fire on the escorts, killing two people on the spot and wounding one person. The robbers then seized the banknote sacks and fled without a trace. Several days later, detectives from the Diswei Road Patrol Station in the Public Concession rushed to Funing and other places in Jiangbei and captured more than ten male and female suspects and recovered a small amount of stolen money. After being brought to trial by the First Special District Local Court, those who were unrelated were released, and the rest were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment according to their circumstances. However, one monk named Wukong (secular name Ji Rentang) was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for life as the principal offender. However, the Public Works Department, which prosecuted the case, believed that the monk was the ringleader and should be sentenced to death in order to cover up his guilt. Therefore, they appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, requesting that the original sentence be overturned and a heavier punishment be imposed. The robber monk was also unwilling to admit his guilt and also filed an appeal. As for the other robbers, they were all imprisoned because the facts and crimes were clear. Yesterday afternoon, Yu, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the Second High Court Branch, specially convened a collegial panel and ordered the monk Wukong to be brought to court for interrogation. First, the lawyer from the Public Works Department, Gan Jingxian, stated the grounds for the appeal, saying that the initial trial's determination of the facts was inaccurate. Although Wukong did not personally commit the murder during the robbery, he was aware of the murder plan. The initial trial only sentenced him to life imprisonment, which was too lenient. Therefore, the appeal was made, requesting capital punishment to serve as a warning. Wukong was then asked to state the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the original sentence, saying that he did not participate in murder and robbery and that he was falsely accused by Wang Chen, Qiu Guobin, and others. He attempted to overturn all his previous admissions of robbery and sharing the spoils. He finally said that he was a monk and was physically weak and addicted to opium, and that he had no qualifications to commit murder and robbery, let alone be a robber. Then, Prosecutor Lin stood up and argued that the facts of the case were fully consistent with Wukong's previous confession. His current appeal is unreasonable. The initial trial's sentence of life imprisonment was a lenient disposition. Now, the Public Works Department believes that the sentencing was inappropriate and filed an appeal, and that whether this was inappropriate should be researched and judged. The court then ordered the sentence to be announced on the afternoon of March 27th. The prisoner was still taken back to the patrol station for detention.</p>

The resolution to organize a legal advisory group was passed, and it was decided to hire Zhang Juansheng, Chen Chaojun, Zai Manyi, Yu Hualong, and Ao Kui as the five members. The letter from the association to the landlord is recorded below: Respected Sir, the situation in this city is not what it used to be. Commerce is declining, falling drastically. Although some are struggling to maintain, most are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The wise landlords and property owners in this city have all reduced rents to ease the burden on residents and seek the revival of the market. Therefore, the rent reduction movement is spreading throughout Shanghai, allowing more than ten thousand people to temporarily catch their breath. To lighten the burden and seek mutual survival and prosperity, the residents of Cishu Lane, Pengzhi Lane, Cixing Lane, Ciyi Lane, Cifeng Lane, Cichang Lane on Nanjing Road, Zide Lane on Zhejiang Road, Lao Cihe Lane, Xin Cihe Lane on Hankou Road, Cili Lane, Cihou Lane, Cile Lane on Jiujiang Road, Cihui Lane on Foch Road, Cishun Lane on Beijing Road, and Cihou North Lane on Annam Road, etc., organized the Hartung Tenants' Association, which has been officially established. Its sole objective is to seek a voluntary 40% rent reduction from your esteemed company. If you agree, the rent will be paid immediately. Otherwise, it will have to be deposited in the bank pending resolution. As for the tenants with contracts, they are all unilateral statements by your esteemed company and are declared invalid from today onwards. This is the will of the public, a reasonable request. It is well known that your esteemed company is a giant in the real estate industry, and your rents are also the highest. In this time of economic downturn, you should share the joys and sorrows, reduce the burden, and maintain the friendship between landlord and tenant. Moreover, your esteemed company believes in Buddhism, has a compassionate heart, and is certainly well aware of the suffering of the people. We earnestly inform you, hoping you will accept, which will be the fortune of the tenants and the future blessing of your esteemed company. This letter is sent for your information, and we request a reply within seven days.</p>

They also arrested the child abductors Gu Tongzheng, Zhang Sanhai, Zhang Wangshi, and the suspected Zhang Sunshi and Huang Zhuangshi on the spot. All were taken to the police station along with the three children. Subsequently, Wang Demo, a resident of Mingde Lane number 232 on Xiexu Road, from Nantong, reported that his seven-year-old son, Yinsheng, had been abducted without a trace on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month. Zhou Heshi also claimed that her child, named Youhe, six years old, living at number 3, Dexing Lane, Xilin Back Road, had suddenly disappeared on the 15th of this month and had not been found despite searching everywhere. Therefore, they came together to identify the children. Soon, they were able to identify Yinsheng and Youhe at the same time. The police station sent the arrested male and female child abductors and the three rescued children to the Ximen Branch Bureau. After questioning by Branch Chief Yao, they were ordered to be temporarily detained, pending the arrest of the fugitive child abductor Zhang Longsheng. Once arrested and brought to justice, they would be sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop on Nanjing Road held a big sale on the morning of the day before yesterday, selling Shengze spun silk for only one fen of national currency per foot. As a result, even before the shop opened, the customers outside had already packed the place, and the traffic was blocked. The patrol room of the station then immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order around the shop. After Lao Jiuhe opened for business, the customers were so crowded that the glass windows were crushed, and a large number of thieves sneaked in to steal goods. The shop had to temporarily close for several hours. The detectives stationed outside the shop arrested fourteen thieves, including Zhang Shizuo, Sun Wenruo, Zhu An, Chen Fengyuan, Wang Jinrong, Wu Xiaodong, Wang Yisheng, Su Chenwen, Jiang Jinchen, Wang Sanjin, Ying Desheng, Li Kunshan, Huang Mingqing, and the woman Shi Jiangshi, in various locations outside the shop, including Shandong Road and Nanjing Road outside the shop gate. A large number of silks were found on each person. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Jiang Baolian sent them to the second criminal court of the Special First Court for prosecution for theft. Wang Jinrong, one of the defendants, said that he ran a barbershop in the French Concession and went shopping that day. The shop threw the goods down from the upper floor, and he took a piece and was about to pay for it, but because there were too many people, he was soon pushed out of the door and arrested. After questioning by Judge Yang Qianchang, each defendant was sentenced to a fine of five yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Rowdies Gather to Gamble and Beat People at the Ewo Wharf in Hongkou, Wang Shubin Seriously Injured, Police Attach Great Importance to the Case <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>At 7:30 last night, a case of rowdies beating gamblers suddenly occurred at the Ewo Wharf in Hongkou. The gambler, named Wang Shubin, runs a food shop at 220 Huaji Road. He likes gambling very much. At the beginning of the lunar new year this year, many rowdies had the whimsical idea of using the daily docking of various steamships of the Ewo Foreign Firm at the wharf to call gamblers to gamble on the ship. The games included Pai Gow and shaking dice. For the safety of the gamblers, lookouts were posted along the way. Therefore, although the police had heard a little about it, they were unable to crack down on it, causing ordinary gamblers to flock to it. At first, the scale was small, but recently the scope has expanded. Gambling starts around 5 PM every day and only stops the next morning when the ship is about to set sail. The winnings and losses amount to thousands of yuan. Wang Shubin is one of the gamblers and goes every day. Last night, he suddenly had a dispute with the rowdies over a trivial matter. The rowdies were numerous, and Wang was beaten and seriously injured. After hearing the news, the police immediately sent detectives to send Wang to the hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries were serious and his life was in danger. The police attach great importance to this case and are currently working hard to investigate it.</p>

<p>He Jiafu, 39 years old, from Shaoxing, came to Shanghai by boat the day before yesterday. After arriving in Shanghai, he hired a rickshaw and was passing near the Bund of the French Concession when two thugs suddenly came. Seeing that He was a bumpkin who could be bullied, they stepped forward and slapped him twice without asking why, and said loudly, "Do you understand the rules of Shanghai? Quickly take out the silver dollars." He was frightened and immediately took out three yuan and six jiao in legal tender from his pocket and handed it over to them. Fortunately, the rickshaw puller knew they were bandits and immediately reported to the police, who chased after and captured one of the bandits, named Shen Agen, 31 years old, from Pudong, and brought him into the police station. The stolen goods were found on him. Yesterday, he was sent to the first criminal court of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer Chen Ming stated the case and said that the police were prosecuting him for robbery. Then, the plaintiff stated the situation of being robbed. When questioned, Shen Agen confessed that Zhang Er called him to step forward and rob. The rest of his confession was vague. Judge Zhang ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for the 24th to re-examine the case.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Public Concession: Health Overview for Last Month, Three People Died from Rabid Dog Bites <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to the Public Concession Health Department's February report, there were no special changes in the health situation in this city this month. The general situation is still healthy. However, since the beginning of spring, smallpox seems to have the potential to break out. There were sixteen reported cases of smallpox last month. This number is not alarming in terms of population, but it also shows that vaccination work must not be neglected. It is said that although the weather was extremely cold last month, the number of vaccinations reached nearly 18,000. Furthermore, measles is quite rampant among children of all ages. Although this disease is extremely contagious and almost all children get it, it should be known that most measles deaths are limited to children under the age of six, and the cause of death is mostly changes in the chest. Therefore, measles should never be taken lightly. After contracting it, it should be isolated immediately and medical treatment should be sought early. The recovery period should not be too short. Regarding the statistics of births and deaths of residents in the concession, what is particularly noteworthy recently is that Chinese citizens are gradually getting used to reporting children after birth. There were a total of 1,597 Chinese babies born in the concession last month, of which male babies accounted for 839. As for foreigners, there were a total of 82 births, 76 in the Public Concession, of which 34 were male babies and 42 were female babies. There were a total of 44 deaths of foreigners, of which non-Chinese Asians accounted for more than half. There was an outbreak of typhoid fever among Japanese residents in the Hongkou area last month, resulting in the death of two people, one British man and one Japanese man, both of whom had not received preventive treatment. Last month, there were cases of rabies in a Chinese child resident in the concession and two residents outside the concession, all of whom were bitten by the same rabid dog. They did not receive immediate treatment that day, and the poison had already penetrated the next day, resulting in an incurable condition. The dog ran into the French Concession after biting people in the Public Concession, and disappeared into the city through the Laoximen. In addition, an elderly man of 61, a non-concession resident, was also bitten by a dog and died before receiving treatment.</p>

<p>At 10:15 the night before last, six bandits suddenly came to the firewood shop opened by Ma Yanhai from Nanhui at number 142, Yang's Residence, behind the Laiyi Bo Youth Association in Pudong. Two bandits were on the lookout outside, and four bandits broke open three doors and broke into the bedroom. First, they drove the men, women, old and young of the Ma family into a corner and tied their hands with ropes. Their heads and faces were covered with cloth to avoid being recognized by the bandits. Then they ransacked the cabinets and boxes, robbing banknotes, silver dollars, small denomination notes, clothing, and other items worth 70 to 80 yuan. They took the stolen goods and fled in different directions. Afterwards, Ma reported to the Pudong Public Security Bureau. Bureau Chief Zhang Mingqin first notified all branch stations and the militia by telephone to assist in the arrest. At the same time, he personally led the patrol officer and police to patrol and arrest the bandits. At around 10 PM, Police Chief Wu Ruixiang of the Qichang Zhan Police Station led the police to intercept the bandit Zhang Agen (29 years old, from Changshu), Ma Afu (30+ years old, from Chongming), and a wicker package containing stolen banknotes and silver dollars worth seven yuan, small denomination notes worth ten yuan, one hundred small silver dollars, over thirty thousand copper coins, one silver bracelet, one silver chain, one silver-plated gold hairpin, and one leather hat. The men and stolen goods were all sent to the branch bureau. After the branch chief summoned the victim to identify the stolen goods and confirmed that they were correct, and based on the bandit's confession, he sent the detective team leader Wang Shifu and detective Jiang Binru to cross the river to Pudong overnight, along with the Ma bandit, to meet with detectives from the Lujiawan French Police Station. At the Xindengfeng Hotel near the Great World, they arrested another escaped bandit, Qian Xiaoer, who confessed that he was 31 years old and from Changshu. He was escorted to the branch bureau. He was taken into custody to await the arrest of the escaped bandits and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. Police Chief Wu's quick action in solving the case and preventing the bandits from fleeing quickly was highly commendable and was reported to the General Bureau for commendation.</p>

<p>To the Editor of the Shenbao Newspaper, On March 19th, your newspaper published an article in the local news section on page 3, stating that Kunshan youth Xue Muqing initiated a bicycle trip throughout Jiangsu Province and cooperated with our group. After investigation, our group has never cooperated with other groups, and Mr. Xue is not a member of our group. The above-mentioned cooperation and other matters are completely untrue. Although our group often seeks new members, to join, one must have a suitable occupation, be introduced by two members, and then be approved by the committee before being officially recognized after the issuance of a membership card. It is not a casual matter. I hope you will publish this in the letters column. Sincerely, The Youth Bicycle Touring Group, March 20th.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News Cup of the Western Football Club will hold its final today at 2 PM at the Canidrome. The two teams that have earned the right to compete in the final are Shanghai A.A. Second Team and St. Francis. Shanghai A.A. Second Team is considered to have a stronger chance of winning the championship. In terms of actual strength, there is a clear difference in ability.

Due to postponements this season, they have not yet met. The two teams must face each other twice this season to expedite the conclusion of the league. In addition to the first match today, the second match will also be played tomorrow. The actual strength of the two teams will be determined after the matches. However, Tung Wah’s Li Yichen and Li Ning have not fully recovered from their injuries and will not play this week, giving Shanghai A.A. a great opportunity.

<h3 id="e181">A Letter to Mr. Ye Yu-hu and Mr. Wu Zhi-hui on the Establishment of the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association (I) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Respected Mr. Xia'an,</p>
<p>Previously, when I was in Suzhou investigating historical sites, I had Wang Peizheng deliver a proposal. I trust you have already read it. I learned from the newspapers that you and others have organized the Wu-Yue History and Geography Research Association. The association is specially distributing pottery fragments from Yan City and Jinshan. The articles eight and nine in the association's charter stipulate the promotion of scholarship, which is especially close to my heart. I recall that last year in May, after I discovered Yan City, I accompanied Mr. Jiang Dayi of Suzhou, Mr. Chen Songmao of Wujin, and Mr. Wei Juxian of Shanxi to your residence to present the situation. At that time, some people proposed immediately commencing excavation. I humbly offered my opinion, which you supported, that in these days of national financial strain and difficult times, rashly speaking of excavation would not only lack the necessary funds but also the talent. This was a most insightful argument. Focusing on investigation and research is the urgent task at hand. Therefore, the organization of today's research association is something that I and others share in our hearts.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman is enthusiastic and impetuous. Last September, following the Huang Bohui brothers of Jinshan, I identified Jinshan as an ancient site as well. That gentleman followed me, urgently requesting to see it in person. Upon returning, he immediately engaged in publicity, exaggerating in major and minor newspapers, taking credit for others' work for his own self-promotion, eager to exclude me and act independently. The false claims he made were hastily publicized before being properly discussed and verified. Without knowing that Jinshan had underground structures, he immediately published the theory that it was washed by seawater. Without knowing that the site had bronze and iron artifacts, he immediately published the theory that it was the city of Shao Kang of the Xia dynasty. The arguments he holds differ greatly from mine. I believed that it was impossible to work together with him and focused solely on outdoor work with Jiang Dayi, using the archaeological method of comparative investigation (comparative may also be translated as connected). This method is valued by Westerners as much as excavation. The Japanese also excel at using it in Manchuria and Mongolia. I have vaguely heard that the Academia Sinica will also use this method to explore the eastward spread of the Painted Pottery Culture. This is because it saves money and yields twice the result. In the past half-year, during school holidays, I have repeatedly gone out and discovered more than ten ancient sites outside of Yan City and Jinshan, including two from the Neolithic period. Attached is a mimeographed summary for your perusal.</p>
<p>Jinshan has "chipped stone tools" (this term is borrowed and does not refer to microliths from the Ice Age). If they are merely used to represent a period, only as tools for carving pottery patterns, then this is certainly the case. But that gentleman published a broken and incomplete stone fragment, only a quarter of which remains, with no edges or sharp points, and no signs of flaking from impact. Examining its print, one might almost suspect it is similar to a Paleolithic tool. Foreigners divide Paleolithic tools into five types, belonging to five periods, plus a "Dawn Man tool" which has not been definitively proven, making seven categories. The ages are very distant, some say 600,000 years, some say 60 million years, and some say 360 million years. Can Jinshan possibly have such a stone tool? There is a method to identifying stone tools, as briefly outlined in my humble work "Stone Tools." The stone tool that gentleman pointed to is even more difficult to identify than a "Dawn Man tool." Last year, when he visited Yan City, a student jokingly pointed to a stone fragment under a mulberry tree, saying that if a certain gentleman came here, he would surely think it was a stone tool. My colleagues and I have repeatedly used this as a joke in front of and behind him. And indeed, upon seeing it, he immediately treasured it and took it home. Returning home, he used it as a rallying cry, and newspaper reports can be found everywhere. Moreover, in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), Lou Xiashan of Nanjing discovered several extremely irregular stone fragments, which Li Ji and others rejected. But he disregarded this and brazenly published it in the *Eastern Miscellany*. Later, when he wrote a certain book, he wanted me to write an inscription of approval. I slightly edited the annotation, but he presumptuously cut and embellished it, changing my complete rejection to half-affirmation. This matter is like a game, and it is truly regrettable that it is listed in the new *Capital Gazetteer* in the bibliography of arts and literature. How can a person who does not know a single word of English, French, German, or Japanese be so fond of talking about stone tools, and every time he goes to a place, a stone tool is always discovered, as if he cannot satisfy his desires without stone tools, and cannot promote himself without stone tools. The academic harm he causes is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Reading the draft articles of association of the Research Association, I find it greatly different from what I have heard. The articles of association regarding the affairs of the association, in articles eight and nine, make special tasks a regular matter. Distributing pottery fragments as specimens is certainly permissible, and I sometimes do it as well, especially to come to meetings and give lectures. But wanting to entrust the education departments of various provinces to have elementary school students in each county and the unrelated public collect pottery fragments is unheard of in archaeological methods. This is again wanting to promote oneself by directing the work of the masses. How can this be allowed? In the past, people had the elegant hobby of "clearing the way to watch plum blossoms." Now, one could match it with "begging officials for ancient inscriptions." How utterly tasteless! Investigating matters requires being on the ground. For example, investigating floods, droughts, and other common governance matters, how can one entrust someone to investigate on one's behalf with a piece of paper? As for investigating all the place names in books such as the *Zuo Zhuan*, broadly speaking, general gazetteers, comprehensive gazetteers, and county gazetteers should have them all. In detail, how can someone who uses an abacus to count the numbers in ancient books claim to calculate which location and name in the *Zuo Zhuan* corresponds to Jinshan and Yan City?</p>
<p>Considering the above reasons, I hesitate to join the research association because I would not be able to live up to the kindness of everyone. But if I join, I would not be able to face scholars around the world. I consider myself a person who has received academic training in the world and is not entirely unintelligent in the country. I did not expect that yesterday, when I went to the China Bookstore to inquire about the date of the meeting, I was at a loss. Later, I received an unsigned invitation from Mr. Jin Zhongqing's secretary, someone. Furthermore, I repeatedly inquired about the qualifications and procedures for joining and attending the meeting. The only thing not asked was gender. "Harsh and unkind," as he himself said in his letter. Alas! The association should be open to the public. Mr. Jin, placing himself in the position of initiator, showed a disdainful expression, rejecting people from afar. I have learned that he is a young Muslim, with living parents, and his own religious rules and family precepts are sufficient to restrain his body and mind from sin. But I feel hesitant and lost regarding the research association. If I cannot join, then it is fine not to join. But for the sake of the history and geography of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are many talented people in Jiangsu Province, and I dare not consider myself indispensable. But I am a native of Zhejiang, and I judge myself that if I were to hold a seat at the end and serve as one of the representatives, I would not disgrace Zhejiang Province, nor would I shame the association. Now, the principles are like this, and the encounters are like that. I have been treated coldly, scolded by acquaintances, squeezed out and rejected in every way possible. When the research association is held, I dare not belittle myself, abandoning my duty. I think that foreign academic societies have corresponding members and opportunities to read papers. I would like to voluntarily sit in as a listener, becoming a non-member member, returning the favor and forever maintaining a good relationship. I only hope that when the meeting is held, the notices and letters are properly instructed to be dropped off in advance, so as to avoid hesitating outside the door again, unable to enter. I am a clumsy and unremarkable person, stubbornly guarding my principles, foolish and ignorant. I hope that you can enlighten me.</p>

May is domestic, and they all feel that her quiet, gentle demeanor has a kind of moving beauty. Nan is a noisy, strong, and powerful girl; they admire her courage, give her a chance to stretch her will, know that she is strong, has compassion, and has the courage to do something big in their little world. Your little Beth is a lady, full of natural grace, gentle and beautiful.

<p>The yarn market, which had been calm for two days, saw prices rise again yesterday. This is because the supply of yarn is tight, and supply cannot meet demand. The banking sector, finding no profit in other goods, continued to buy yarn this month. According to the market, there is still a shortage of delivery bills, and cotton yarn in the warehouses is gradually moving. As a result, market sentiment is high, and prices are rising sharply. Judging from the actual situation, there is a possibility of further price increases in the future.</p>
<p>Prices of Yarn Rise Across the Board The market for yarn opened with prices firm across the board. There was a shortage of new sales in the market. At the same time, the prices of three-grade yarn from overseas were stable, but the supply of actual yarn was extremely tight, and market prices rose slowly. As a result, prices rose by 2.4.6.7 dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened with an unusually lively atmosphere. The goods for the fourth and fifth months from the factories have already been sold out, and most factories have no sufficient spot supply. The cotton yarn stored in the warehouses is showing signs of moving. The banking sector is doing everything possible to see prices rise. Thus, market prices are soaring. Generally speaking, the price of yarn is lower than the spot price, and there is still room for prices to rise. As a result, prices rose by one yuan to 1.1.3 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. According to records, 850 bales were sold by Tongji, 1050 bales by Jinchang, 600 bales by Mingde, 1150 bales by Renfeng, 900 bales by Gu Da, 800 bales by Juxing, 800 bales by Shengyuan, 1400 bales by Yu Da, 850 bales by Yi Chang, and 700 bales by Yongchang. 800 bales were bought in by Hengyi, 2450 bales by Hexing, 1450 bales by Changyu, 650 bales by Hengde, 2750 bales by Runkang, 550 bales by Yongda, 1700 bales by Xincheng, 1450 bales by Changfeng, and 700 bales by Taichang.

<p>The cotton market rose sharply, and the situation is tense. The reason is that the delivery bills for this month are not sufficient. After the inspection office approved 20,000 bales, Tongji is preparing to take delivery of the goods. Bears are actively covering their short positions, and market prices are advancing step by step. The far-term has come out of the five-yuan level, it is said.</p>
<p>Prices of Cotton Rise Step by Step The cotton market opened with prices firm because American cotton was calm and lacked features, spot prices fell by one pound, far-term prices rose by 2 to 9 pounds, Indian cotton fell by 0.5 to 1 rupee, and Osaka three-grade cotton fell by 5 cents to 1 dime. However, market sentiment turned upward, because the bulls are preparing to take delivery of goods this month, and the far-term is being driven up. As a result, prices rose by 1.5 dimes to 2.3 dimes compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened with an increasingly lively trend. Buying momentum became more intense. It is said that the price of Indian cotton in the dark market is trending up by 2 rupees, and the closing price of three-grade cotton has recovered. The market is short of bills, and prices are getting tighter and tighter. At the same time, the spot cotton trade is booming, and the far-term has broken through the five-yuan level. As a result, prices rose by 1 dime to 2.5 dimes compared to the morning closing price. According to records, 1000 bales were sold by Senkang, 7500 bales by Yuan Yi, 1700 bales by Changfeng, 1500 bales by DAFU, 2000 bales by Yu Da, 2700 bales by Jichang, 2500 bales by Yi Chang, 1700 bales by Shengyuan, 1100 bales by Ruiyuan. 2600 bales were bought by Tongji, 3800 bales by Hexing, 2100 bales by Shenji, 1500 bales by Renfeng, 2000 bales by Mingde, 2500 bales by Changfeng, 4900 bales by Runkang, 2800 bales by Yuanxingchang, and 1400 bales by Xiecheng.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with stable conditions, and prices for each month rose or fell by one pound. The March period fell to 11.35 cents because there were 19 delivery notices, the bulls settled, and the government sold stockpiled cotton. The remaining months were firm because dealers bought near-term months and foreign firms bought far-term months. Before closing, dealers covered their short positions, and prices were still firm and high. As a result, spot prices fell by one pound, and futures prices rose by 2 to 9 pounds except for the March period, which fell by two pounds. There were very few new accounts, and dealers were watching. The weather in Texas is dry, but cotton fields are increasing. British cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 1 point. Indian cotton exporters bought slightly, and there were fewer sellers.

<p>Full Day Result Continues to Fall by 9 Dimes</p>
<p>The gold market was even more sluggish yesterday. There was only an 8-dime fluctuation throughout the day. The situation was stable in the middle, and dealers were even more on the sidelines. Silver prices rose, and the results continued to decline downstream. Market sentiment is still difficult to boost.

At this time, it hovered around 48.5 yuan, and large accounts slightly accepted, rising slightly for a time. However, it soon fell due to many settlements. The silver balance tax was announced at a length of 75, with not much impact. After this, it reversed weakly, but market sentiment was unstable. After falling low, there was a sudden covering of short positions, stabilizing prices at noon. The afternoon market was even quieter, with only 3-dime fluctuations.

<h3 id="e191">Grains: Results of Revising Flour Inspection Standards <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The import flour inspection plan, which had been discussed at the two National Commodity Inspection Technology Conferences in 1933 and 1934, was officially implemented at the end of 1934 by order of the Ministry of Industry. Tianjin and Qingdao were the first to start in January 1935, followed by Shanghai in September 1935 and Hankou in March of this year. There were still some difficulties regarding the standards. Recently, in order to improve the flour inspection methods, the Ministry of Industry ordered the Commodity Inspection Technology Research Association of the ministry to convene a flour inspection subcommittee meeting. After receiving the order, the association convened a meeting at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau from the 16th to the 18th of this month. Representatives from various commodity inspection bureaus attended, including Wu Jiazhen from the Tianjin Bureau, Nian Pu from the Qingdao Bureau, Chen Zi from the Bureau, Zhou Zhen from the Bureau, and Jiang Gongchen. This meeting was of great importance to the national flour inspection administration, and important issues such as inspection standards, grading methods, and improvement of domestic flour were discussed. The results of the meeting are of interest to all parties. After detailed inquiries, the following is a brief description:</p>
<p>Regarding the standards for wheat flour inspection, the committee conducted a detailed discussion of the qualified standards for wheat flour inspection (i.e., Article 5 of the current Detailed Rules for Wheat Flour Inspection). It is reported that the content was largely revised as follows: Properties: The properties of imported wheat flour must not be moldy or show signs of mold, and must not contain parasites. Impurities: Imported wheat flour must not contain the following impurities: (1) Harmful inorganic substances, such as stone powder, chalk, alum, and copper sulfate; (2) Harmful plant seeds and flour milled from wheat infected with ergot; (3) Other starch flours. Moisture: Not to exceed 15%. Ash content: Not to exceed 1%, but whole wheat flour may be relaxed to 2%. Nitrogen content: The nitrogen content of wheat flour shall not be less than 1.25% (this is a new addition). Acidity: The acidity content of wheat flour, expressed as lactic acid, shall not exceed 0.25% (this is also a new addition). Regarding the grading method for wheat flour, the current Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for Wheat Flour Inspection stipulates that the grade of wheat flour shall be assessed based on the results of the inspection under the preceding article (Article 5 of the Detailed Rules), and the grading standards shall be as follows. It has now been resolved to adopt a point system. The point system is divided into: Color - Full score 10 points; Moisture - Full score 20 points; Ash content - Full score 20 points; Coarse fiber - Full score 20 points; Nitrogen content - Full score 30 points.</p>
<p>The method is to evaluate points according to the above regulations and add up the points obtained for each component of the wheat flour to determine its grade as follows: First grade: 76 points or above; Fourth grade: 40-31 points; Second grade: 75-56 points; Fifth grade: 30 points or below; Third grade: 55-41 points. Regarding the issue of improving domestic wheat flour, under the current situation, the quality of domestic flour is generally not as fine and white as imported flour. These advantages and disadvantages are closely related to the manufacturing method. It is reported that the meeting decided that the commodity inspection bureaus in various regions, as well as the Central Agricultural Experiment Station and the Industrial Experiment Station, should conduct on-site investigations of the actual manufacturing situation and then study improvement methods.</p>
<p>It is reported that the above proposals will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval before they can be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e192">News of Damage to American Wheat: Flour and Wheat Prices Rise Again, Trading in Special Certificates Cancelled, Market Activity Light Yesterday, Mills Reluctant to Buy, Few Transactions <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The flour market opened in the morning with prices showing a strong trend. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat continued to rise by a small two cents, the general public assumed that imports of foreign wheat would be affected due to the major floods in the United States. Therefore, sentiment gradually rose and buyers were slightly more active. Near-term contracts rose by one cent, while deferred contracts rose by two, three, or four cents. However, after the second session, prices fell back by about one cent as many retail bulls sold off. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was unusually quiet, and both buyers and sellers were mostly watching. With the exchange charging extra for special certificates, speculators found it difficult to operate, so the trend was calm. Near-term contracts only improved by one cent, while deferred contracts improved by two or three cents. It was also decided yesterday that flour certificates would revert to the original price of 250 yuan from today.</p>
<p>In the futures wheat market, prices opened slightly firmer in all months in the morning. With the cold of spring still lingering and floods occurring in the United States, industry insiders and outsiders could not help but pay attention. Although trading was not active, prices rose by three, five, or six cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading in the current month was very quiet, with only one price quoted. Since the flour market did not show any sharp jumps, buyers were also watching and not stepping forward. Prices for each contract month were similar to the morning. Unless the weather is sunny and wheat seedlings thrive, people may have to look downward. There were few spot transactions because mills were reluctant to buy. Quanzhou merchants were making small purchases of khách sien rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday's khách sien rice market remained flat and weak due to a continuous stream of arrivals, but sales were not as brisk as in previous days. Moreover, local buyers were inactive, and the market was even more sluggish. Repurchase activity was strong, and the market price seemed to be falling again. Subsequently, Quanzhou merchants suddenly made small purchases of over a thousand bags, and local and Nanjing buyers also made some purchases. Newly emerging hoarders were also making inquiries, so the market returned to a standstill, but it was still three to five cents lower than before. A total of 6,000 bags of Gan rice, 248 bags of Taiwanese rice, and 200 bags of Han brown rice were traded throughout the day, as well as 150 bags of Siamese rice.</p>
<p>Both Thick and Thin Rice Fell: Source Transports Increased Yesterday, Price Fell by Two Cents (South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source transports from various groups suddenly increased again, with over sixty shipments arriving (a total of over 13,000 shi). As a result, sentiment turned weak, and local sales were sluggish, causing the market to weaken further. The price of thick early japonica rice continued to fall by one cent, and although some buyers from Jin, Qing, Yan, and Long continued to purchase thin rice, they were extremely picky, and supply exceeded demand. As a result, the price of higher-quality rice also fell by 1.5 cents, while mid-grade rice fell by two cents. Du Jian rice was soft in price, and Yin Bian rice was one or two cents lower. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over thirty shipments arriving from various locations downstream. The local market for white japonica rice was unusually quiet, with very little activity. Prices were expected to be weak, with near-term prices falling by about one cent. Mid-grade rice fell by one or two cents, early rice followed suit by a small fraction of a cent, and thin rice transactions were flat, with prices falling by a small fraction to one cent. Transactions in white yuan rice were sluggish, and prices were weak by a few cents. There were some purchases of Yin yuan rice when the price was right, so it also fell by a small two cents. Yang Du khách rice sales were also sluggish, and prices fell by a few cents. All types of rice showed a weakening trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw increasingly sluggish market conditions and increasingly light trading. The low trading volume was an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of the exchange. The total trading volume for the day was only 1.05 million, with the 96 Government Bonds accounting for 460,000 and the Five Consolidation Bonds accounting for only 590,000. It can be said that the afternoon trading was even more depressed, with only 175,000 in consolidation bonds traded in the two sessions. What was even more peculiar was the closing of these two sessions, with only the April contracts of types A and C of the Five Consolidation Bonds having price quotes, while the rest failed to open. Such oddity was truly unprecedented. It seems that the financial community and speculators have completely abandoned this lifeless government bond market. Although there have been slight changes in the current environment, it is not easy to stimulate this numb market price. The range is becoming narrower and narrower. Although large transactions can be gradually completed, it will be difficult to turn them around in the future, which makes people even more afraid to proceed. Yesterday, the market price hovered between five fen and one jiao, and the daily result was only a small five fen and one jiao increase. The March type B Consolidation Bonds, which did not open for trading the day before, rose by two jiao in comparison. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>A report from the New Fung Yang Company stated that yesterday's (19th) New York stock market was strong, but trading was light. Auto stocks surged the most due to good auto production figures in March. Chemical stocks also rose, farm implements were strong, and many specialty stocks soared sharply. Utility stocks saw mixed gains and losses, railroad stocks were firm but sluggish, and although steel mills were disrupted by floods, steel stocks still rose. Good dividend reports made speculators quite happy. Small exchange stocks rose, the bond market was firm, and the total trading volume for the day was 2.02 million shares. The Dow Jones New York index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Sichuan pickled mustard greens are becoming increasingly scarce, and prices continue to tighten. Top-quality goods are being quoted at 22 yuan by buyers. It is estimated that the total inventory in the market, including goods in transit, is less than 4,000 tan. As a result, market prices are rising, and high-quality goods are being quoted at 20 yuan according to market rules, up another yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Sugar Market: Guangdong White Sugar Supply Exceeds Demand <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the sugar market, the guild allocated prices, with spot prices for Two-Four Dutch rough white sugar quoted at 22 yuan and 3 jiao, but no transactions were made. Transit goods fell slightly by five fen, with 300 bags traded at 7 yuan and 5 fen. There was little change in East red-white sugar. Transit goods of YPO brand were offered at 6 yuan and 5.5 jiao, with some transactions. Number 4 East white sugar was quoted at 22 yuan and 2 jiao, and transit goods were sold slightly at 7 yuan and 1.5 jiao, down by a small five fen. The price of locally produced fine white sugar was stable, with Zhenji Number 1 sugar still at 20 yuan and 9 jiao, and other grades were rarely offered. Given the current sales situation, Qing sugar may loosen.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative held its bid-clearing session yesterday. Five-Goat rough white sugar and other grades were bid at the original price, with a total quota of 7,752 bags. As a result, only 60 bags of Number 2 fine white sugar were traded at 21 yuan and 1 jiao, and 110 bags of Number 4 fine white sugar were traded at 20 yuan and 9 jiao. This clearly shows that supply exceeds demand, and the market may loosen in the future.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of spring, the market for crude oil and white wax has been weak. Fortunately, foreign firms and local soap factories have made large purchases, so the supply of crude oil from Jiangxi and other regions has fallen short of demand. However, most of the stockpiled Jing sesame is held by hoarders who want to sell at a good price, resulting in the current market stagnation. According to industry observers, the market price will rise step by step when candle makers start operating in the summer. News from Hanchuan indicates that the price of Ma City sesame (as it is known locally) is a weak 15 yuan, but there are few buyers. News from Zhejiang indicates that the price of Tong Qing sesame has risen due to gains in both Tong Oil and Qing Oil, so the price of Du Zhi sesame has also followed suit, rising by three or four jiao. Yesterday, Japanese firms offered Jiangxi goods (objective) at 19 yuan and 8 jiao, and white goods at 12 yuan and 7 to 8 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e198">On the Superiority of Women over Men <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Su</p>
<p>Common opinion generally holds that men are superior to women. For thousands of years, a male-centered society has formed all kinds of patriarchal ideas and behaviors, with men considering themselves superior and women inferior. The missionary's saying, "Giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel," clearly regards women as weak individuals in need of protection based on religious theory.</p>
<p>In fact, in terms of physical constitution, women are indeed inherently superior beings who are more suited for survival. Although men's muscles and bones are more easily trained to be strong and suitable for athletic development, women are stronger in resisting disease and extending lifespan.</p>
<p>Women are often perceived as sentimental and prone to illness; however, fatal diseases are less common in women than in men. According to medical statistics, the average number of deaths from the same illnesses is always higher in men than in women. It seems that patients with stomach ailments, ulcers in the internal organs, hardening of the liver, pneumonia, asthma, and weak heart conditions are more likely to die if they are male.</p>
<p>The average lifespan of men is shorter than that of women. The fact that there are more widows than widowers is a common and obvious phenomenon. According to the U.S. census statistics, the number of men over 55 is less than that of women; the difference is even greater for those over 75; and there are twice as many women as men among centenarians. Among retired U.S. presidents, only one is still alive, while six former First Ladies are still living. This is also a readily available good example for self-deprecation.</p>
<p>Women are more prone to headaches, neurasthenia, epilepsy, etc. However, fewer women commit suicide than men. It is commonly believed that women are narrow-minded; however, this can conversely prove that women are more tolerant than men.</p>
<p>It is sometimes thought that men's shorter lifespans than women's are due to environmental pressures and acquired disabilities. For example, overwork, smoking, drinking, and irregular eating and living habits. However, these reasons are not reliable. According to U.S. mortality statistics from 1920, the infant mortality rate for male and female infants under one year of age was 125 compared to 100. More male infants are also born and die or are born with disabilities.</p>
<p>All of these examples can prove that women are inherently and acquiredly superior to men.</p>

<p>— (Zhi Yun)</p>
<p>However, after a medical examination, only 7% were granted permission, and 11% were allowed to increase their working hours by two hours. However, at the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan, because the economic situation of the country had gradually improved, and the management of consumption control had become relatively relaxed, in the past year, only a little less than 5 per thousand of the industrial women in Moscow applied for an increase in working hours. (Only a little over 1 per thousand were granted permission.)</p>
<p>Although the world has noticed Chinese women for their engagement in industry, they have also been making considerable efforts in literature in recent years. In Moscow, Leningrad, the Caucasus, the vast Siberian desert, and throughout the country, there are countless women who have been specially commissioned by government-established publishing agencies to write descriptions of the lives of workers or peasants, as well as portrayals of all kinds of painful lives. They receive generous compensation and have the hope of receiving medals. Last year, out of the 163 writers selected from all over the country, women accounted for 57.</p>
<p>There are more than 200 nurseries in Moscow and its surrounding suburbs. The largest can accommodate about 3,800 children, and the smallest can accommodate 400. Men account for only 17% of the staff in these nurseries, while women account for 83%, making it the agency with the highest ratio of women service. In recent years, studying medicine has become a fashion among women. In 1925, there were only 97 female doctors and about 400 nurses in Moscow. But in 1935, the number had increased to 547 female doctors (including obstetrics, dentistry, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, orthopedics, and veterinarians) and more than 2,700 nurses. Among them, 35% had graduated from medical universities in various European countries and returned to China. Women account for a ratio of 18 to 1 with men as judges across the country. Storov, who presides in Moscow's divorce court, which has the reputation of being "Moscow's Reno," is one of the female judges. In Russia, many of the ships sailing on inland rivers are now captained or served as first mates by women. On a cargo ship sailing between Vladivostok and the Black Sea (via the Pacific Ocean), a woman trained at the Vladivostok Maritime School is also the shipmaster. In the Moscow Air Force, many women have voluntarily enlisted and are undergoing training in piloting, aerial combat, and parachute landings. Recently, in a performance war in Omsk, women outperformed men in landing results.</p>
<p>Anyone who travels to Russia will feel the extraordinariness of Russian women and, at the same time, the general lack of feminine tenderness. But perhaps this is what makes Russian women Russian women and enables them to have such great work efficiency. (Compared to these women, what do you think of our Chinese women, who specialize in applying makeup and flattering men, drinking, playing cards, and seeking enjoyment?)

<h3 id="e200">Ms. Chen Lingyi's Views on Modern Women <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Political Participation Association was reorganized last year into the Chinese Women's Movement League, with Ms. Chen Lingyi as the chairman. I visited her the day before yesterday. Regarding her views on the women's movement, she is a lawyer who used to be a university professor. Since middle school, she has enjoyed participating in the women's movement, and her enthusiasm is still as strong as ever. She said that her past work was biased towards the upper class, but now she is focusing on the women's movement at the lower level. This change in direction can be said to be a reflection of the experience gained. In the past, the women's movement in China was mostly biased towards the intellectual class, but now it is leaning towards lower-level work, which is indeed a progress in the women's movement. I believe that the broad masses of working women, whether in spiritual or material life, are far from enjoying the comfort enjoyed by noble women. Therefore, to liberate women and improve women's rights, the route must be from the bottom up, from the shallow to the deep, to be effective. Ms. Chen's words resonate with me. Readers who want to know more details, please read the following:</p>
<p>Ms. Chen first had some opinions on the "virtuous wife and good mother" concept, saying in essence: "The theory of 'virtuous wife and good mother' is popular now, and some people add the word 'new' as if to cater to the new era. In fact, the 'new' and the 'old' are still the same soup with different medicine, consistently advocating the same thing. According to the needs of modern society and the country, men and women are in a completely equal position. Men don't need to talk about being a virtuous husband and good father, and women don't need to talk about being a virtuous wife and good mother; these are essential conditions for both men and women, and there is no need for much discussion. Rather than singing these old tunes, it is better to advocate how men and women can be healthy 'citizens' to serve society and the country, which is more practical. In the Middle Ages, a woman was considered a virtuous wife and good mother as long as she managed her family well; in modern times, it is too contemptuous of women to only manage family affairs and not ask about other things. They should undertake the major affairs of society and the country in the same way as men; moreover, family affairs are ultimately simple, and a woman who can serve society will definitely be able to manage her family. On the contrary, a woman who cannot work for society may not be able to organize family affairs. At present, women's ability to act is far worse than men's, and we should do our best to encourage women to come out into society and work together, and not limit women's activities with family affairs and bury their talents."</p>
<p>Her second point was: "Modern Chinese women cannot give up their families to serve society. The social systems of our country and the Soviet Union are completely different. They can reduce their family responsibilities and focus on social work, while we should take care of both. The minimum limit is to manage family affairs well. I feel that China's social system is too bad, and women's careers cannot be developed. Everywhere there is talk of private sentiment, and private individuals are employed. This trend cannot be reformed to this day. For example, women who are truly knowledgeable and capable often cannot get a position to develop their ambitions, while women who are weak in ability can use private forces to get higher positions and rewards. As a result, because of their shallow knowledge, the efficiency of service is poor, giving people a bad impression. Therefore, there are criticisms of women's careers. This is not the fault of women themselves, but because all parties in society do not value talent, resulting in unfortunate results for women. For example, the long-standing traditional idea that men are superior to women is an insurmountable barrier that has the most serious impact on women's careers. I hope that the national politics will gradually get on track, and that talent will be a prerequisite, so that women's careers can have an average development.</p>
<p>Since Ms. Chen insisted on the principle of taking care of both social service and family affairs, I asked her if her actions were consistent with her words. She said: "My home is in the countryside not far from the capital. I live on the sea. Although I cannot take care of it myself on weekdays, the family affairs are completely designed by me, and my parents do as I say. We take an extremely cooperative approach." At this point, she answered my experience in handling family affairs: "I have one son and two daughters, all of whom are studying in elementary school. From a young age, I have set a rule that whatever I say I will give him, I will give him, and whatever I say I will not give him, I will not give him. The children are very obedient, so they don't have the bad temper of asking for something and threatening them by crying and laughing. They don't eat snacks, they don't wear silk clothes, and they develop hygienic habits. It is better to make a few more sets of cloth clothes so that they can do more activities during the day and change clothes frequently. If they wear silk clothes, the children must keep clean and cannot exercise casually, which limits their physical education. They are given 160 wen for pocket money every day, but they only spend half of it and can also save it, developing the habit of saving. Sometimes I leave things for the boy, and he must divide half of them to his sister. Conversely, she also divides them to her brother, so that they can break the idea of ​​patriarchy from a young age and arouse the interest of mutual assistance and cooperation. This is a humble opinion of mine, not enough to be considered elegant. ..."</p>
<p>She strongly disapproved of the extravagant habits of ordinary female students in the city. Those responsible for education should try to correct them and cultivate the interest of female students in group life so that they can still muster the spirit of serving society and seeking the welfare of the masses after leaving school. Finally, she reported on her past participation in the women's movement: "When I was 16 years old, I was studying at Nanjing Women's Normal School. It happened to be the time of the May Fourth Movement, so I often participated in various activities. After being promoted to Southeast University (now Central University), I felt the danger of being young and energetic and not seeking practical learning, so I buried myself in studying hard for several years. It was also the time of the May 30th Movement, so we studied nursing skills to prepare for any possible mobilization. In 1928, I went to France and studied at Toulouse University. During this period, I also lived a life of study and did not ask about the world. In recent years, in addition to my personal job, I have been serving in the Women's League. I deeply feel the pain of general women's lack of education and the misery of exile. I want to start from the lower-level work, which is more important than other work; it can also be said that a new awareness and new efforts are being nurtured from the poverty of the past women's movement!"</p>

<p>— Xu Zhenchi</p>
<p>The Daughter of Former British Prime Minister MacDonald to Become the Owner of a Small Inn</p>
<p>—Shaming Tens of Thousands of Parasites in the World—</p>
<p>Zhuo Wenjun marrying Sima Xiangru and selling wine to support herself has been a beautiful story passed down through the ages. Now, there is a daughter of the Prime Minister, showing her glory. She recently decided to purchase a quaint old country inn from the 17th century and become its owner. The news has stirred the newspapers and caused a sensation, enough to make those so-called parasites tremble with shame. Here is a translation of the general situation, to serve as an inspiring tonic for our 200 million female compatriots.</p>
<p>Miss Ishbel, daughter of former British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, has long admired the hotel industry. According to her sister, Sheila (now Mrs. Dr. A. Mackinnon, residing in Leeds), her younger sister has her own business ideas and has many friends in the hotel business who often provide guidance. Therefore, this decision to purchase a property and set up a business is something she has always intended, so there is nothing strange about it.</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the British tabloid Daily Sketch, Miss MacDonald's plan to buy a shop has been in her mind for a long time, and she has traveled through the countryside, looking for a suitable location. Until recently, she saw an old farmhouse inn called Old Plon Inn in Speen and visited it several times in disguise. On November 24, she finally decided to buy it, and the procedures should be completed within two weeks, before she returns to London (she currently lives with her sister).</p>
<p>The inn was built in 1621, originally as two small thatched cottages, which were merged into one in 1727. Ten years ago, the house was acquired by County Magistrate Pat Beckett, because the first owner of the house was Mr. Gan Jin (Kitohener) from Khar Tonw, and Beckett's wife was Gan's niece. Today, the shop is owned by C.B. Child, who continues the old business. This gentleman has renovated the interior of the shop, undertaking major construction projects that took four months to complete. As a result, what was once kerosene lighting is now electric lighting, and what was once well water is now running water. However, the uneven rafters, wide fireplaces, and narrow, winding stairs remain as before, still filled with ancient charm. Child, along with his wife and one child each, share the shop's duties, taking on everything from purchasing goods, cooking, and washing, without any servants. If things get too busy, the guests also help out. The shop does not offer banquets; beer is always available from the cupboard and stored in a small cellar next to the kitchen. Most surprisingly, Child's cat is also named Ramsay, the same as the former Prime Minister's title, leading her to love the business. Is this not fate! Next to the shop, a new children's playground has been set up, housing birds, rabbits, donkeys, and dogs. In the future, the daughter of the Prime Minister will have this wonderful structure, enjoying it and handling everything with ease. The business will surely flourish.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Should Women Return to the Home? <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Qiuying</p>
<p>The trend of the world is turning back again, loudly shouting "Women should return to the home." Should women really return to the home? Or should they definitely learn from Nora's departure?</p>
<p>Many people believe that "men govern outside, women govern inside" is a matter of course. And women themselves, of course, can no longer tolerate the cage-like boudoir. And in fact, there are many women who have received higher education, get married, and become isolated from the world, not hearing or asking about anything. (Or even living their extravagant young mistress lives.) On the other hand? The position that society gives us is destructive, not improving. What happens after Nora leaves is also a question.</p>
<p>So, should women return to the home? Or should they run into society? It is really an unanswerable question now. The facts are placed in front of us, the family needs women so much; the facts are also placed in front of us, society does not need women so much; the facts are even more placed in front of us, it is so difficult for women to get a position in society, and if they fulfill their responsibilities in the family, it seems so possible!</p>
<p>But no matter what, we must recognize a goal: women are "people"! The universe is fundamentally half male and half female, and we should stand in a position on this earth. We do not ask about any means, our position is always to be seized.</p>
<p>For our friends—half of mankind's men. We have nothing to argue about, what we are arguing about is the position that we should have had before. With the goal recognized, we can move forward. What is the strategy for hard work? I think only the two words "labor" are our supreme creed, and nothing is gained without labor. China's revolution is not thorough, so there is the emergence of the Hong Xian imperial system: the women's movement is not thorough, so society has an excuse to turn back. The incompleteness of the results lies in insufficient "labor". So we demand the position of women, we just have to take responsibility, in the family take the responsibility in the family, in society take the responsibility in society, we present the results to the public, this is our true strength.</p>
<p>Originally, in this transitional period, we are carrying a double burden, one is to endure the old pain on our shoulders, and the other is to carry the old one to open up new paths for the benefit of future generations. Naturally, strictly speaking, history is always changing, and there is no "past" and "future" except for the "transitional period". People in any period are carrying this double burden, so life is improved in this way. In short, we do not have to ask for rewards and labor, our rewards are sought in history.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay attention to: although it is said that it is not possible to answer which side is better, returning to the family or entering society, we must understand that the family and society are two inseparable bodies. If there is no position in society, there is no position in the family. If we can only fulfill our duties to the family and do not have a vision of society, we may not be considered to have fulfilled our responsibility to society. Don't be fooled into thinking that being a virtuous wife and good mother is fulfilling the responsibility of being a person. Yes, being a virtuous wife and good mother is not impossible, and being a virtuous wife and good mother is not a major responsibility. And when you are a virtuous wife and good mother, don't forget that you are doing a "person" for society! The former and the latter seem the same on the surface, but the attitude is different. Pay attention, we must not be confused by seemingly right but actually wrong theories. Even when we return to the family, we must remember the society. Therefore, the relationship between husband and wife, father and daughter, brother and sister should be purely emotional, but the most important thing is to have an independent personality!</p>

<p>— Lu Gu Wen Shu</p>
<p>The previous issue of this magazine published Mr. Zhang Yi'an's article on the legal inequality of men and women in France, giving us a lot of information about the fact that French women cannot be equal to men in legal terms. This truly shows the low status of women's rights in France. It is indeed surprising that this situation of low women's rights can grow in France, a democratic and advanced country that shouts freedom and equality. The author's observation of the reasons for this decline is nothing more than: 1. Religious relations, 2. Educational influence.</p>
<p>1. Religious relations, France is a Catholic country, and most of the people believe in Catholicism. We know very well that the church is doing its best to oppose the expansion of women's rights, saying that it is based on the Bible: the most perfect woman does the most arduous work, holding a spindle in her fingers, meaning that women only need to hide at home to take care of housework, and do not need to care about other things. It is a pity that French women, because they want to obey God and be good women who believe in Christ, have lightly put aside their inherent rights.</p>
<p>2. The influence of education, in all-female schools in France, the school authorities use textbooks and other reading materials for female students that teach you how to weave cloth, how to bake bread, and teach you to be docile and kind, hoping to create them into future virtuous wives and good mothers. In addition to these textbooks, the books about women's issues that they can often see are the works of three-K authors. Many of France's great writers and writers are mostly affiliated with the banner of the three-K doctrine, for example,</p>
<p>Joseph De Maitre, in a letter to his daughter, once said: the biggest mistake a woman makes is imitating men, imitating men is their delusion. Fenelon said, good women should twist threads, hide in a corner, listen and be silent. Moliere would say: a learned woman is ridiculous. These three-K writers are also a major cause of the decline of women's rights.</p>
<p>I remember that Voltaire, a scholar who represented new ideas in Europe in the eighteenth century, was still scolded by the French for saying: women can do everything that men can do. They falsely accused him of saying this to compliment a certain woman at the time. It seems that women's rights are still a long way from raising their heads in France.</p>

<p>— Yang Chen Qianru</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Women's Association began in the seventh year of the Republic of China. At that time, women with far-sighted vision and knowledge, in view of the modern trend, wanted to develop social and cultural undertakings. Without the joint efforts and collective wisdom of women, it would not be successful. Therefore, the advanced women first planned and managed it carefully, worked hard, and moved forward with determination. Relying on the support of society and the guidance of comrades, the Chinese Women's Association was established. Its purpose is to connect Shanghai women, promote social undertakings, cultivate civic knowledge, develop national concepts, consolidate international friendship, and develop the culture and skills that women should have. At the beginning of its establishment, because the sea was a mixed place with different habits and different dialects, the number of members was not large, and there was a sigh of ups and downs. Fortunately, the advanced members of the association vigorously promoted and continued to move forward, making the association respected in society and becoming an important group full of spirit in Shanghai. We drink water and think of the source, and we have never forgotten it in our hearts. The blessings of the advanced women to society are not shallow. If women in the academic and business circles can support each other with the idle ladies and work together to develop social undertakings, using the compassionate nature and solidarity of women, so that the association can be expanded from a small organization to a large organization, the reputation of the Chinese Women's Association will be spread throughout China in the future, and it will be guided and sponsored by all walks of life in the world. Recalling the past, the association was established for the purpose of communication and increasing friendship. Later, comrades discussed and improved each other, and then came out to promote social welfare, develop civilian education, assist in charitable undertakings, and all work related to women, advancing bravely and sparing no effort. The association has set up many free schools in the places where the poor live in various parts of the city, such as the free schools in Caojiadu, Yangshupu, Ximen, and Xiaoshadu Road. The school in Caojiadu is a primary school, studying for four years, teaching common national knowledge, so that they can make a living after graduation. The schools in Yangshupu and Ximen are set up for working women to make up for their studies. The one in Xiaoshadu Road has a higher level, teaching the knowledge that civilians should have, and daily economics, so that students can know a little about living within their means and planning ahead, helping them to remove the difficulties in life. After graduation, they can serve in the two schools in Yangshupu and Ximen. A commune is also set up near the school, so that the residents of the area have a place for recreation after work, which is very good. The management of the above four schools has been wholeheartedly supervised and guided by the Young Women's Association, and the results are very significant. Although the association is responsible for the economic responsibility of the free schools, the Young Women's Association's assistance in handling it should not be forgotten. Moreover, the colleagues have never neglected the health of the students in each free school. In addition to obtaining education and training, they also have the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau responsible for health and medical protection, which is meticulous. Some members also lead the students of the free schools on outings in the summer, and they can also enjoy the happiness of children during the Christmas season. This is just a glimpse of the association's service to society.</p>

<p>The brain is the capital of the human body, managing all affairs and having heavy responsibilities. If there is a lack of endocrine in the gonads, the brain marrow will lose its nutrition and become weak. As a result, symptoms such as dizziness and vertigo will arise. In severe cases, there will be insomnia, forgetfulness, mental fatigue, and lack of energy. The treatment method is naturally to nourish the brain as the main focus.</p>
<p>Patient Yu Xueying has long suffered from brain weakness. Not only does she have headache, dizziness, tinnitus, and blurred vision, but also insomnia and forgetfulness, which is unspeakable. Last winter, she came to me for treatment. After I told her to buy "Gonadin" from Wuzhou Pharmacy, because of its great effect in nourishing the brain, she took several boxes in a row and felt that her brain was clear and healthy, and all the symptoms disappeared.</p>

<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Women's diseases are mostly based on uterine diseases. Uterine diseases are generally caused by reproductive decline. Therefore, if female gonadal preparations are used, women's diseases will recover quickly.</p>
<p>Women smoke mostly because of a hundred diseases, which cannot be cured, and mental distress, which leads to smoking addiction. "Female Gonadin" is not only the authority of female gonadal preparations, but also because it has effective ingredients for removing toxins and quitting addiction, so it is used to treat all kinds of gynecological diseases and quit opium, which can achieve the most perfect special effects. I have recently used "Female Gonadin" to quit the smoking addiction of Mrs. Xiao Qizhang and others, which is enough to prove that it is the supreme good medicine for treating diseases and quitting smoking.</p>

<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Rheumatism is most likely to linger. In mild cases, there is soreness in the bones and joints and cramps in the muscles. In severe cases, there is numbness in the limbs and hemiplegia. Examining its source, some are caused by rheumatism within, and some are caused by residual toxins that have not been cleared. Ordinary medicines cannot take care of both. Therefore, if you want to seek a radical cure, it is difficult.</p>
<p>Patient Meng Zhiwei has suffered from this disease for many years, and repeated treatments have been ineffective. Lingering until now, he came to me for consultation last winter, complaining of numbness in the limbs and hemiplegia. After I diagnosed that Mr. Meng not only had rheumatism within, but also residual toxins that had not been cleared, I told him to buy the famous medicine "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company and take it for several boxes in a row. Not only were his limbs flexible and his whole body delicate and healthy, but also his bones and muscles were comfortable. I also told Mr. Meng to take "Gonadin" to help him recuperate, because he had been weak for too long. It took more than two weeks before he was completely cured.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation are often confused as the same disease. In fact, their causes are different. Therefore, their treatment and medication should also be different. Generally, if you want to treat both diseases with tonics, not only is the medicine not right for the disease, but it is also by no means a single dose that can cure it.</p>
<p>Based on my many years of clinical experience, I most appreciate using "Hemic's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to treat spermatorrhea, because its medicinal properties are royal and have no side effects. "Gonadin" is the most perfect for treating premature ejaculation. Recently, Mr. Niu Ganshi suffered from both spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. Repeated treatments were ineffective. After I told him to buy the above two medicines from the Western Medicine Department of Sincere Company, he achieved the most perfect special effects in less than a month.</p>

<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Smoking to relieve illness is as harmful as drinking poison to quench thirst. However, because patients at the time were troubled by illness and pain, they were ignorant of medical principles and rushed to use medicine, which led to smoking addiction in 80 or 90 percent of cases. Recently, smoking has been severely banned. If you want to quit, you are also restricted by illness and pain, which makes you feel embarrassed and at a loss. Isn't it very sad?</p>
<p>Last month, a Mr. Pan, whose name is unknown, came to complain of stomach pain, spermatorrhea, and other symptoms, and asked for safe smoking cessation. I told him to buy "Hemic's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from Taihe Pharmacy to treat his spermatorrhea, and "Stomach Pain Ling" and "Jianwei Su" to radically cure his stomach pain. I also used "Gonadin" to remove his smoking toxins and improve his weakness. Famous medicines were used together, each treating its own symptoms. In four or five weeks, he was told that all the symptoms had been removed and he had safely quit his addiction. He thanked me happily and left.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mrs. Luo Qiuyan said) I have been suffering from leucorrhea for a long time. Because of the restrictions of the environment and the shackles of etiquette, I cannot tell anyone. It is inconvenient to see a doctor and there is no way to take medicine. As a result, I have been procrastinating until now. My body is weak and I am suffering physically and mentally. (Omitted) Last autumn, I sent a letter to this magazine. I was told that I could secretly treat myself according to the law by taking (Female Gonadin) internally and using (Leucorrhea Ling) externally. I immediately went to the nearby Sino-French Pharmacy to specify the purchase. I took it internally and externally according to the law for about a month. Not only did the leucorrhea disappear and the menstruation was regulated, but also my body became strong and healthy, and I regained the health and beauty of a young woman, which my husband did not expect.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Comrades in the underworld have reached the end of their days. The extreme penalty is imminent and cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, they have risen up to seek smoking cessation. Everyone has the same heart. However, many people have lost their recuperation after quitting, which has led to repeated thoughts and relapses. Examining the reasons, it is generally because the residual toxins in the body have not been cleared and the body is weak, and various diseases are clustered, which leads to mental depression and physical and mental distress in 80 or 90 percent of cases. I am writing this article for reference.</p>
<p>"Gonadin" has the functions of both saving decline, treating diseases, and removing toxins and quitting addiction. Therefore, it is not only the supreme good medicine for safe smoking cessation, but also can be used as a recuperation agent for those who have suffered mental pain and repeated diseases due to other methods. Seeing the success of Mr. Lv Fengzhou of Kangdi Road in using "Gonadin" to recuperate, I believe it even more.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Fei Wuchang said) I used to suffer from spermatorrhea and could not cure it radically. After marriage, I suffered from premature ejaculation, which was even more painful. My body became weaker and weaker, and my vitality was gradually lost. My nerves were weak and there was no hope of health. Fortunately, a close friend introduced me to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng, who gave me a detailed examination and knew that I also suffered from chronic gonorrhea. He prescribed good medicine and performed electrotherapy. He also told me to buy "Hemic's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from the Sino-British Pharmacy to treat spermatorrhea and "Gonadin" to treat premature ejaculation. (Omitted) Today, I am free from all diseases and have regained the joy of health. It is not only due to the rich experience of the famous doctor, but also to the magical effects of the famous medicine.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Bu Zhiyun said) I have been suffering from bone pain for a long time. Repeated administrations of various agents have not improved. Whenever there is cloudy and rainy weather, I feel more soreness in my bones and muscles, and my whole body is strained. (Omitted) Fortunately, a close relative introduced me to Dr. Zhan Nianceng. According to him, it was because I had previously suffered from gonorrhea and had mistakenly taken inferior medicine, which led to the collection of toxins into the bones. He performed electrotherapy and told me to buy "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy for treatment for a month. I was cured. Dr. Zhan's skillful hands and compassionate heart have benefited the people a lot.</p>

<p>(1) Neurasthenia and Malnutrition</p>
<p>Long-term Illness Suddenly Recovered</p>
<p>Patient Zhong Yunbiao, 44 years old, from Zhenhai, worker. (Chief complaint)—Neurasthenia, congenital deficiency, acquired malnutrition. (Medical history)—Mr. Zhong has a weak endowment, resulting in many diseases. In addition, he is ignorant of health preservation, which makes him weaker. Symptoms such as back pain, palpitations, night sweats, cold limbs, and dizziness appear. He came to me for consultation last winter through the introduction of Mr. Wang Guangying. (According to Mr. Wang, he had previously suffered from venereal disease and was cured by me with "Hemic's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets.") (Treatment)—I diagnosed that the source of Mr. Zhong's illness was the decline of the gonads, which could not be effective with other preparations. I immediately told him to buy "Gonadin" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. Because the medicine was prescribed correctly, he took less than five boxes. His nerves recovered and flourished, and all the symptoms disappeared. He regained the youth of his youth.</p>
<p>(2) Loss of Vitality and Decline of Function Spermatorrhea, Premature Ejaculation, Electrotherapy, and Drug Therapy</p>
<p>Patient Shi Qihua, 31 years old, from Baoshan, businessman. (Chief complaint)—Spermatorrhea, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and kidney weakness. (Medical history)—Mr. Shi was also injured by masturbation and sexual labor, resulting in the above symptoms. Repeated treatments were ineffective. Prolonged treatment resulted in loss of vitality and decline of function. He has been married for many years. Not only is there no hope of fertility, but also the husband's job is lacking, and he suffers great physical and mental pain. He came to me for treatment last autumn. (Treatment)—In addition to performing the latest scientific surgical electrical therapy, I also told him to buy "Hemic's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to treat his spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission, and "Gonadin" to treat his premature ejaculation and kidney weakness. Taking the medicines together had complementary effects. Therefore, in about four weeks, all the symptoms were eliminated and vitality was restored.</p>

<p>Patient Gu Yuda, 29 years old, local, academic. (Chief complaint)—Yellow face, blood deficiency, kidney deficiency, thin waist. (Medical history)—Mr. Gu was too diligent in his studies when he was young, which led to brain weakness and physical weakness. After that, he suffered from dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, and forgetfulness. Various symptoms appeared. Repeated administrations of tonics had no effect. In recent years, he has suffered from blood deficiency and kidney deficiency. He is not yet 30 years old and has shown a state of inactivity. He came to me for consultation last winter through the introduction of his classmate. (Treatment) I diagnosed that Mr. Gu had brain weakness and anemia. It was impossible to nourish his brain marrow and enrich his blood without using effective gonadal preparations. I immediately told him to buy "Gonadin" from Wuzhou Pharmacy. The effect was obvious after taking it. He felt at ease and took half a dozen boxes in a row. His brain became clearer and healthier, and his essence and blood became stronger. He returned to the youth of 23 or 24 years old.</p>

He had been procrastinating and had not been treated. His hands and feet gradually became numb. In addition, his appetite was not open, his digestion was poor, and he was malnourished, losing his strength. He came to me for consultation last winter. (Treatment)—After I diagnosed that the root of his disease was that the residual toxins had not been cleared, I told him to buy "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from Huamei Pharmacy for symptomatic treatment. In addition, because his stomach was dull and weak, and his body was thin and weak, I also told him to take "Jianwei Su" and "Gonadin" to nourish him. In just a month, not only did the bone pain disappear and his hands and feet became flexible, but also his stomach became strong and his body became healthy. He was like two different people before and after.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Commercial Rectification <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Since the "Genuine Goods, Honest Prices" and "No Deceit to the Old or Young" signs have been replaced by "Huge Discounts" and "Buy One Get One Free" banners, the city's commerce has become increasingly depressed, falling into extreme panic. As a result, in order to maintain their businesses, merchants do not hesitate to use "deceptive" means to attract customers and "cutthroat" methods to compete with their peers. The "credit" of merchants and "morality" of commerce are disregarded. Under these circumstances, the advocacy of rectification in the business community is truly an excellent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Small profits and quick turnover are correct, and commercial competition is also not objectionable. These are all methods for developing business. However, small profits and quick turnover and commercial competition should be pursued through legitimate means. Exceeding this path will result in a loss of merchant credit and a violation of commercial ethics. However, recently, merchants have been attracting customers solely through deception, attempting to profit under the slogan of "disregarding costs," and resorting to all possible means of mutual exclusion among peers. For example, the competition in the silk and satin industry has even promoted a reduction of one cent per foot, which is sufficient to demonstrate the intensity of their cutthroat competition. Merchants who disregard credit and morality and only seek to attract customers and exclude peers will not only deceive customers, but also inevitably lead to mutual harm. Such deception can only take advantage of the moment. Over time, when the tricks are exposed, no one will patronize them. Haven't you seen many stores in the market loudly touting themselves, but their doors are still as deserted as before? This is truly a path to self-destruction.</p>
<p>Therefore, rectifying commerce is indeed necessary. "The success of a business lies in no secret other than self-encouragement through prudence and hard work, treating others with fairness and discernment, treating customers with humility, and treating peers with mutual assistance. If the above principles are discarded and one seeks novelty, failure is inevitable." Therefore, all industries should "deeply awaken, take care of commercial ethics and reputation, and unify their steps." Without this, it is impossible to maintain merchant ethics or reverse the misfortune of commerce. This is also the reason why the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a notice to "crack down on merchants' false competitive sales and maintain commercial ethics."</p>
<p>However, while commercial rectification is very proper, can the current state of commerce be salvaged by rectification alone? Under the shadow of economic panic, the city's prosperity was originally superficial. The decline of commerce can be seen in "bankruptcies" and "liquidations." The "huge discount" banner is an even more alarming manifestation. Why do merchants engage in false advertising, deceive customers, and exclude peers? This is because they want to seek "survival" through "struggle." This method is naturally unsustainable and will eventually fail, but without it, even the desire for temporary maintenance may be unattainable. The crisis of the commercial future is hidden here. This is also the reason why the entire market is so turbulent.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the business community wants to save commerce, rectification is certainly necessary. At the very least, it can restore merchant credit and curb cutthroat competition among peers. However, the fundamental solution still requires efforts to revitalize commerce. Only when commerce has its own way out, improper means are reformed, and peers can coexist and prosper together, will the cutthroat competition cease.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Mr. Blind Man (Continued) <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>"Don't be so wicked, I haven't made a single sale today."</p>
<p>The children, however, kept laughing beside him. The blind man more carefully probed with his stick, step by step, the little copper bell tinkling softly. The children still followed, not giving up until they had successfully tormented Mr. Blind Man, unless they were discovered by adults, scolded, and called home.</p>
<p>There was no way to avoid the children's frequent deliberate harassment and mischief. Therefore, although the blind man felt very hateful in his heart, he still had to treat the children kindly. Although his eyes had lost their light, the stick in his hand was now like two eyes. He knew how to walk out of his house, how to walk through every street, and what kind of shops were on each street as familiarly as a sighted person. Therefore, that stick was simply like a second life, and he could not leave it for a moment. If he lost it, he did not know how embarrassing and helpless he would be. When he heard the sound of footsteps following behind him, a faint murmur, he knew that the children were looking for trouble for him again. What he feared most was having his stick snatched away, so he first tried hard to grasp it tightly, and then said pitifully:</p>
<p>"You torment me every day, you won't have a good death, your descendants will be like me." He couldn't help but get angry when he was so pestered.</p>
<p>The children, of course, did not understand the pain of a person suffering from the greatest shortcomings. They just did what they wanted to do based on the temporary excitement of their childish minds. Besides, the blind man could not see others, but others could see him. The children often became even more unrestrained.</p>
<p>When Mr. Blind Man got really angry and cursed a few harsher words, the children's methods became even more ruthless. His earthen blue cloth long gown was a new one that he had changed into when he went out. The more mischievous children, seeing it, secretly ran to the drain and grabbed a handful of mud, and waited for the blind man to pass by, throwing it hard at his body, and the originally clean white gown was immediately covered in dirt.</p>
<p>"Heh, the blind man will get a scolding from his blind wife tonight."</p>
<p>The children clapped their hands and laughed.</p>
<p>The blind man stamped his feet repeatedly, his face turning green, so anxious that he could not say a word. Only then did the children scatter away contentedly. Only the blind man was left in the deserted alley, shaking that lonely and monotonous bell. His mouth moved slightly, muttering to himself, not knowing what he was saying, but it was nothing more than cursing those children in secret. But soon, when he was about to finish walking through the alley and step out onto the main street, he suddenly fell off the three-step stone steps, his head hitting a rock, and blood streamed out, covering half of his face.</p>
<p>The children ran out from their hiding places with low laughter to see, but they did not expect the blind man to be hurt by the fall. When they saw his face covered in blood, they were all frightened and slipped away.</p>
<p>It turned out that they had first used a rope to stretch across the alleyway between the entrances, very high off the ground, to block his path, and then hid to one side, waiting for the blind man to fall into the trap. The blind man struggled painfully on the ground for a long time before he could get up. He took out his handkerchief and wiped the blood off his face.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I don't know what sins I committed in my previous life to suffer this fate."</p>
<p>He walked on, complaining softly.</p>

<p>Dr. Liu rubbed his hands painfully, his face appearing even paler under the intense lamplight. He paced back and forth in the room. Only when he sat down in the armchair by the fireplace did he realize that the coal in the fireplace was about to burn out, and the flames were breathing weakly. So Dr. Liu rubbed his hands again and called his servant, Genfu.</p>
<p>This was Dr. Liu's resting room. When Genfu first came, Dr. Liu had solemnly instructed him that he could not freely enter and exit this room unless he heard a call, as if there were some secrets hidden in the room. Genfu was a strong middle-aged man who served as a handyman, receptionist, and carriage driver. He had been working for Dr. Liu for eight years. He knew what his master meant, and after his consultations were over, he liked to lock himself in the room and sit quietly. For eight years, he had never violated the rules and broken into the resting room. He was the loyal servant of this single master. But for the past half month, the illness of a middle-aged woman named Liu had made his master uneasy. He could clearly hear his master's pacing footsteps constantly in the next room. The fixed 7 o'clock dinner was often delayed until 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock. Dr. Liu's life order had been disrupted. Genfu was even more unwilling to leave, sitting in the next room waiting for his master's call.</p>
<p>Dinner had been prepared long ago, but since returning from a house call, the master had been pacing in the resting room. Hearing the call, Genfu hurriedly pushed the dishes into the room. Dr. Liu was constantly rubbing his hands in the sofa. He shook his head at Genfu. "Make the stove hotter. I don't want to eat," he said.</p>
<p>"Doctor, the weather is warm today," Genfu replied.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at Genfu distrustfully. "No, I'm very cold."</p>
<p>Genfu added coal to the fireplace. He mumbled,</p>
<p>"Doctor, have a little food, it's already 9:30."</p>
<p>Dr. Liu shook his head and waved his hand at him, looking too lazy to open his mouth, and wrinkled his brows in pain. Genfu slowly picked up the plate and asked again:</p>
<p>"Doctor, do you seem to be sick?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm sick!" Dr. Liu sighed with a smile, "Genfu, from tomorrow on, I want to stop consultations and go somewhere." He immediately stood up from the sofa, "Leave it, I'll eat a little."</p>
<p>Genfu happily served the meal for his master and stood by his side, saying:</p>
<p>"Doctor, you should rest. I'll inform those patients who need house calls tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Don't go. When they come, tell me that I'm out."</p>
<p>Dr. Liu went to bed very early that day.</p>
<p>The next day, a young female guest knocked on Dr. Liu's door. Genfu opened the door and replied through the glass hole that his master was out. The female guest said in surprise: "That's not true, the doctor told me to come see him this morning. When did he leave, and where did he go?"</p>
<p>"He left on the early train. The doctor didn't say where he was going," Genfu replied. As he was about to close the hole in the door, the female guest insisted on letting her come in and take a look.</p>
<p>After the female guest entered the door, she went straight through the consultation room to push open the door of the resting room as if she were very familiar with the place. Genfu was unable to stop her in time and immediately followed the female guest. The female guest first searched the desk, rummaging through the drawers, examining each item carefully as if she were a detective. Genfu stood dumbfounded at the door. He did not understand the origin of this female guest, nor did he understand what she wanted. He watched her search from the desk to the bookshelf, to the objects piled on the fireplace. When she felt disappointed and fell back into the sofa chair, she sternly asked Genfu. "Where exactly did the doctor go?" She jumped up like a dog in a rage. "Tell him my mother is dead..." The female guest fainted. But Dr. Liu suddenly appeared at the door. He carried the female guest to the examination room, immediately closed the door, and locked it. Genfu heard him urgently opening various glass bottles...</p>
<p>When Genfu heard the call and went in, the female guest was already sitting safely beside the doctor. The doctor pointed to her and said, "This is Miss. Clean up the empty room upstairs and make it Miss's bedroom."</p>
<p>The doctor immediately hurriedly helped Miss out the door, and only at the gate did he instruct Genfu: "When patients come, tell them that Dr. Liu has moved."</p>
<p>Genfu watched the backs of this strange father and daughter, and went upstairs to clean the room with surprise and joy.</p>

<p>— Laoxin</p>
<p>— The Story of Haihang —</p>
<p>It was spring, wasn't it. The wind that blew in was no longer so piercing on the face, but it was still so stagnant, not lively. The flowers hadn't bloomed in full, and the grass wasn't green and soft and lovely. Lao Gui and I were cooped up in the warehouse all day long, a bit like being in prison, listless and without spirit. Third Master had gone back to the countryside these past two days to get two brothers to come and be new partners. The new partners, Old Seven, had angrily said it was "just sending them to their deaths." Old Seven had also been running in and out all day long, not coming back until late, seeming to be busy with something. People said that he was trying to find a way out. He had said, "Even if it means selling people as coolies, I won't do this line of work."</p>
<p>In the warehouse, it was just the two of us left, sitting there bored. We had no relatives in the provincial capital, and even if we had one or two, we wouldn't want to go, for fear that people would nag us about whether that incident had hurt anyone. When that incident was brought up, we would get angry, preferring to keep it all bottled up inside rather than rattling it around like household goods.</p>
<p>The Second Boss had a beak-like sharp nose, and as soon as it tilted up, he would be in a bad mood again. And as soon as he got in a bad mood, he would find someone to scold: either scolding Ah San for not filling the opium pipe enough, or saying that Ah Si had been "wanking" last night. We were so scared that we didn't dare stand in the front shop, preferring to sit in this smelly warehouse and taste this terrible feeling. Everyone had suffering in their hearts, but no one would say a word first, as if afraid that if they said it out loud, it would lose its flavor.</p>
<p>Sometimes we would think about going out for a stroll, sitting there idly was more annoying than being in prison. So we thought of the new landfill; we thought of Central Park; we thought of going up Guanyin Mountain in the middle of the night to see those shameless students, haunting each other in pairs; we even thought of going to the rooftop of the Dashin Company to see the "wild chickens" [prostitutes] and have some fun. Even if it was just the most boring thing, slowly strolling on the road, from Shuangmendong to Dongdi, or from Shibapu out of Fudeli and into Chentang to see some third-rate prostitutes in the bean-mud brothels. But no one could muster the enthusiasm.</p>
<p>It was raining outside. As soon as rain was mentioned, we couldn't help but —</p>
<p>"Damn your mother's rotten thing, it's raining again…"</p>
<p>The rest of the sentence, we didn't dare say. As soon as rain was mentioned, we would naturally have to mention the shipwreck at Baietanshuikeng a few days ago, and even more so, we would have to mention Fifth Uncle, one of our old companions, a kind, honest, steady fellow, how he struggled, how he fell into the water, and to this day, there was still no sign of his body.</p>
<p>We looked at each other, and then lowered our heads again.</p>
<p>"Like this, we've passed another three days… three days!…"</p>
<p>Lao Gui said with a sigh. He hadn't finished speaking, and seeing his expression, we really didn't want him to finish. From the front of the shop, a tragic voice floated over —</p>
<p>"Second Master, Ah Wu… this time… what's going to happen?… If he doesn't come back to life, how will we live?… Our family of four, we all depend on him, we all depend on him… Second Master, you know, we don't have much land in the countryside, and even the fields we cultivate belong to other people. If Old Wu has an accident, dies… dies, we… look, two are still four or five years old, one hasn't been weaned yet… Wuwuwu…"</p>
<p>The end was a tragic cry, intermittent. The shop was very quiet, as if there was no one there, only her—Fifth Uncle's wife—crying, begging. Lao Gui bit his thick lower lip, very anxiously, almost biting until he bled. After a while, he muttered to himself again:</p>
<p>"Damn that smelly thing, to hell with it, really! That short-smokestack warship, that bastard ship flying the Rising Sun flag, if it hadn't sailed over, would we have capsized? Damn you bastards, one day, I'll see your father kill you all in a frenzy, don't come here swaggering around…"</p>
<p>He stood up, his eyes glaring.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the front shop shouted again, a voice rushing in saying — "Old Wu's… found… Second Boss!" Followed by a mess of… mixed with Fifth Aunt's sharp, shrill cry. Without even thinking, we rushed out. Second Boss was putting on airs, sitting in the accounting room smoking his water pipe, frowning a little, looking a bit like an evil god. We ignored him and pulled the messenger, Ah Fu, rushing out, Fifth Aunt following behind.</p>
<p>We walked unsteadily on the road, almost falling, almost bumping into people. The children were crying, shouting, jumping. Fortunately, it wasn't far to the Gaogang Convenient Hospital. We walked into the mortuary. A wave of stench rushed over us, but we couldn't care less. We walked straight to Fifth Uncle's body before we could steady ourselves. Fifth Aunt hadn't even recognized him clearly when she fell to the ground in tears, and the children cried even harder.</p>
<p>Fifth Uncle was lying straight there, looking a bit fierce. His body was filled with water, like a bloated dead pig. Blood and water were flowing from his face, but we could see the accumulated, resentful expression on his face.</p>
<p>I don't know why, biting down hard on our molars, we walked onto the road. The road was suffocating too, it was strange weather, not like spring.</p>

<p>Germany recently submitted a reply to the League of Nations, which contained the word "Absbald." It was immediately translated as "immediately," causing misunderstanding among the member states of the League of Nations. However, according to Germany's claim, this word is interpreted as "immediately" in northern Germany and as "as soon as possible" in southern Germany. Head of State Hitler is from southern Germany, so it should be interpreted as "as soon as possible." Tan Laosan said that when it comes to science, our people dare not boast, but when it comes to "splitting hairs," our people do have a unique skill. It is a pity that when Germany submitted the reply, it did not consult our Mr. Zhu and add a footnote first.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Zhenying is truly a filial son for celebrating his parents' birthdays. It is said that only 3,000 invitations were sent out, but as of the 15th, the number of gift registers exceeded 30,000. Someone roughly estimated that the value was at least more than 100,000 yuan. Tan Laosan said that this is not enough to show the lofty status of Mr. Xiao and the breadth of his social circle. It is time to honor his parents and make a name for himself. Someone said that Mr. Xiao should be particularly surrounded by those who are eager to curry favor under these special circumstances.</p>

<p>— Bai Yun</p>
<p>Warner Oland to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>The news of Warner Oland's arrival in Shanghai has been reported in various newspapers. According to reliable information, he will arrive in Shanghai on the Asia Empress liner on the 22nd of this month (Sunday). After arriving in Shanghai, he will tour Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping for two weeks. Chinese and Western people in Shanghai are preparing a welcome, and there will be a grand occasion at that time. The Charlie Chan he played on the screen is the only famous Chinese character on the screen, and almost the whole world knows him. His latest work "Shanghai Blood Case" Charlie Chan in Seanghai will soon be released at the Da Guangming Theater in this city. Regarding your resume, I will now report to the newspaper readers:</p>
<p>Warner Oland - Charlie Chan</p>
<p>These two names are almost one and the same. They both appear to be calm and knowledgeable, endowed with profound wisdom and quick talent. Warner Oland's performance on the screen, expressing Charlie Chan's characteristics, seems more real and moving than a real person.</p>
<p>Warner Oland's "Shanghai Blood Case" is a latest production of 20th Century Fox. The famous Chinese detective on the screen has once again built a feat from a mysterious headless bloody case. This is his tenth time playing this role. Warner Oland began starring in Charlie Chan films in 1931. The stories all come from the detective novels of the famous American writer Earl Derr Biggers. Someone had previously wanted to bring this novel to the screen, but failed three times. At that time, Warner Oland, who had played this oriental himself, was considered to have some chance, and it really succeeded after one try. There were as many as nineteen actors who were tested with him at the time.</p>
<p>Because of the powerful contraction of his eyelids, the upward sweep of the ends of his eyebrows, and the drooping of his two mustaches, Warner Oland doesn't need makeup to look like an oriental. His first Charlie Chan film, Charlie Chan Carries on, was highly praised by critics, who recognized him as an excellent actor on the screen. He was born on October 3, 1880, in the county of Omiya, Sweden. At the age of twelve, he followed his family to the Americas and lived in Boston.</p>
<p>Chaplin's New Film "Modern Times" with Female Lead Paulette Goddard</p>
<p>In his youth, he had the ambition to become a judge, but after graduating from Boston High School, he forgot everything and ran to the Curry School of Expression. There, he was practicing singing, so he was endowed with a beautiful bass voice. One day, he went with a group of classmates to the backstage of a Boston theater, where a play called The Christian was being rehearsed. He played a role in that play. After the performance, the manager offered him a salary of fifteen dollars a week to tour the country. At Warner Oland's request, the deal was finally agreed upon at eighteen dollars a week.</p>
<p>From then on, he worked on the stage for fourteen years, traveled to many places, and performed plays by Ibsen and Shakespeare. His first dedication to the screen was in the film Jewels of The Madonna. Later, Pathe produced the film Patriai. There was a Chinese character in it. An oriental actor had already been hired, but because the actor's height was not suitable, Warner Oland took on the role. He had played many films before starring in Charlie Chan films.</p>
<p>His wife, E. Sheen, is a famous painter in Boston, so after their marriage, he became quite interested in this art. In his home near Santa Barbara, there are many oil paintings hanging and many Chinese art treasures hidden. The couple mostly live at home, but sometimes they go to his 7,000-acre ranch on Balmy Island for a week. When filming, they live in a cottage at the Beverly Hills Hotel. They sometimes go for walks or do sketches side by side. They both like swimming and sunbathing. Their fixed companions when traveling are two beloved dogs.</p>
