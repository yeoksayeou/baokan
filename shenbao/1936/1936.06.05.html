<h3 id="c12">日本之南進 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>在這個華北風雲日急的時候。日本向南方的擴展。也更見其積極化了。據本月二日華聯社電。日政府為加緊推行南進政策。決卽開始廣泛之活動其具體辦法。為在外務省系統內設南洋課。然後合海軍之南洋課。曁拓務省之具直接關係機關。及台灣南洋兩拓殖會南洋償發會社暹羅協會。菲島協會。南洋研究會等。民間公司與社團。組織大規模的委員會。從事研究推動。這樣可見日本向南的擴展。已是如何的急迫了。</p>
<p>日本的南進政策。原是與大陸政策相輔而行的。大陸政策的實施。在海洋方面必須有強大海軍的保障。強大海軍的維持。就成為日本向南擴展一個重要的因素。在大陸政策的進展中。海軍只是處於消極的輔佐地位。這當然不是海軍當局所能滿意。他們以為強大的海軍不能僅作陸軍的附屬品。而當採取獨立的戰略。於是海軍當局更竭力宣傳向南擴展不但適應國防和戰略的需要。並且還是解決經濟困難的兵捷徑。他們以為只有日本統治了南洋。纔能取得糧食原料的充分供給和廣大的市塲。</p>
<p>自廣西內閣成立後。永野海相卽要求擴張海軍預算額為五憶五千餘萬元。以增強海軍實力遂行南進政策。最近更經內閣數度的集議。決定所謂「新南方政策。」以台灣為根據地。銳意和南太平洋各方面擴展。（該政策的要點是：（一）置經濟重要於台灣南部無高雄。（二）闢設南洋代管地與台灣間的航空綫。（三）設立台灣拓殖公司。（四）設立南洋拓殖公司。）</p>
<p>日本南進政策的最初步驟。當然是謀以政治的經濟的控制華南。這我們觀於最近福建所謂「自治運動」的活躍。台北飛機塲的落成。閩南各縣日本文化館的設立。以及日本考察團之往來頻繁。就可以得到具體的證明。其次若暹羅。若婆羅洲。若馬來亞。若斐律賓。若荷蘭東印度。都是它南進的志要對象。特別是在暹羅。最近它的活動尤為積極。如慫恿暹政府開鑿克拉（Kra）運河。並派了許多專家去做暹政府的顧問。據前幾天報載。暹羅曾派了許多海軍學生到日本留學。都是日暹連絡的明證。</p>
<p>但是日本的繼續南進。不消說將跟不列顛發生嚴重的衝突。英國對於日本在華北的拓展可以寬容。對於它向南方的威脅郤不能再予讓步的。卽如日本要在克拉地峽開鑿運河。就斷不能為英國所許。因為這條運河一通。那向來被稱為「東方直布羅陀」的新嘉坡。就將成為死港了。最近英國的竭力在新嘉坡香港等地設防。目的無非是為了防止日本。</p>
<p>總之。日本南進政策是與大陸政策並進的。在目前華北局勢緊張的時候。它向南的擴展也愈形積極了。我們注意華北的現勢。同時也不能忽略我們南方的危機啊。</p>

<p>— 周其勳</p>
<p>最後是造句模倣。到了耳的訓練有相當的成績，口頭模倣也有了根底，敎師紕可以使學生閱讀英文，模倣造句。對於倣造句子初高中學生能力很大，應該儘量模倣。譬如說：Iam　mr．wong　here　yesterday，學生己經懂了，敎師就可以令學生用you，we，they　等字來代替I；又可以用met　noticed，Spoke，to等字來代替sawo又譬如I　write　the　letter　可以改造為I　write　letters，The　letter　is　wittens　　I　have　the　litter　　written，he　has　two　letters　written等形式。這種模倣能使學生活用文法舉一反三，反復練習，益處甚大，敎師應該時時利用此法，這是第三個方法。若能照以上三個方法去敎或去學英文，那有不成功之理</p>
<p>英文的發音</p>
<p>就英德法三國文字說起來，英文的發音要算最難。每一個英文字母在一個字裏所代表推薦表的音，變化非常之多。假使每個字母所代表音能够一律的話，那麽發音就比較容易。德文就是如此。英文的發音困難就在這裏。我們現在舉個例來說明。</p>
<p>第一—字母同而音異，例如：</p>
<p>Cat　get　exact　man　bin　woman　show</p>
<p>City　gem　estra　human　bind　women　cow</p>
<p>（等是）</p>
<p>第二—音同而字母異，例如：</p>
<p>Cat　sit　such　bed　win　lies　shows</p>
<p>head　light</p>
<p>Kitten　City　hutch　said　women　buys　go</p>
<p>（等是。）</p>
<p>第三—有字母而無　，例如：</p>
<p>Knot　graw　fatique　sign　bough　couldguard　buy　write　awry　right　han　Fkerchief　psalm　Programme等是。</p>
<p>第四—字的寫法不同而發音完全相同，例如：</p>
<p>gnaw　flower　mourn　caulk　nose　mode　sewdd　thyme　hosrse　nor；flour;morn；cork；knows；mowed；sowed；time；horse等是。</p>
<p>就以上種種的例子看來，我們知道英文的法極不規則。我們看見一個字不能够按照它的寫法去發音要彌補這個缺點，現在大都採用萬國音標，所謂成國音標就是International　Phonetic　Association所製定發音符號。現在這種符號一共有四十六個。每一個符號，代表英文一種發音。凡是見到一個英文字裏有這個音，就用這個符號表示出來。這個符號的發音是不變的。所以我們認識了這些符號，就知道怎樣發音。英文上有二個字，它們的發音，我們常常疏忽。一個是of，一個是off。這兩個字發音不同，of讀作ov，off讀作of。所以of和off兩個字，在英文普通的拼法上，我們看不出它的發音上的不同，但是我們一查Daniel　Jneo，所編的An　English　Pronouncing　Dictionarysc我們就知道如何發音了。現在我們報紙上不是常常將英國地名Birmingham　Buckingham，Cunningham等字同），譯作伯明漢麽，這是錯誤的。繹錯的原因就是譯的人看見Birmingham這個字拼法上最後有ham，所以就將ham譯「漢」，那裏知道h在這個字裏，是沒有音的。因此可知看了拼法來發音，不是完全可靠的了。又如英文地名worcester，Leicester二字讀作wuso　lests，但是我們平日不留心，或不去查Daniel　Jones的An　English　Pronounceng　Dictioany我們常會錯誤。所以萬國音標對於發音是非常有帮助的。再the字有時讀作I（emphatir　Jorm或在母音之前）有時讀作　（子音之前）。Ａ字有時讀作ei（emphatie）有時讀作（unemphatic）。這種分別，學生都應該注意。現在一般的高中的英文讀本，每課的生字都加注了萬國音標的發音，總算比較以前進步，但是還不見儘量去利用。編書的放在敎本裏還不過聊備一格。所以遇到發音應該特別注意的地方，還不見用萬國音標注出。我們希望在高初中的敎師和學生多多去利用萬國音標纔是。（完）</p>

<p>（十五）穀城之見聞</p>
<p>由老河口北行、爲通陝孔道、所謂老白路、卽以河口爲起點·經穀城·均縣·鄖陽·而至陝西之白河、在軍事·政治·商業上、皆有重大意義、但聞過去主持修築之路局局長·與地方官吏、有不可告人之苦衷、路基路面橋樑涵洞之工程、皆極草率、路面高低不平、車行如在雲霧中、乘客常撞頭流血、一遇天雨、卽旬日乃至數月不能通車、政府與人民、交受損失、修路工人、係就地徵發、未費分文、而政府所撥工費、仍達五十餘萬元、國人辦事不肯認眞、可爲浩嘆、近日全省公路局長王强、竭力整頓、但北段已爲水冲、修復不知何日、而路站站員、復有一種驕傲之習、常侮辱旅客、河口站員允甚、旅客謂其「蠢如鹿豕、狠若豺狼、」確有幾分相似、蓋積重難返、亦鞭長莫及也、記者由河口登車、不知能開至何地、聽其所北而休、行六十里達穀城、又因一夜風雨、道路不通、勾留數日、</p>
<p>城爲周時穀伯封地、後爲筑陽、明末張獻忠之亂、卽發難於此、現隸襄陽第五行政督察區、風氣閉塞異常、一入其境、「天上並無二主、人間只有一尊、」與「皇恩春浩蕩、文治日光華、」一類春聯、時觸眼簾、令人哭笑不得、後聞該縣不僅民智低落、卽敎育界亦復爾爾、且派別紛歧、縣城有中心小學、校長係一染有嗜好之老朽、敎員多力不勝任、從前八十二師特黨部駐此、曾辦敎員研究班、黨部他調、卽戛然而止、受訓之敎員、全被排擠以去、敎育經費、年達二萬元、所用僅一萬四千元、餘則不知下落、</p>

<h3 id="c107">時局平靖無事　滬市金融穩定 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>銀錢拆息平靜票據交換銳增　外匯穩定國家銀行盡量供給　證券交易所各債券一致上漲</p>
<p>新新社云、本市金融雖某方傳出無稽消息、但金融市塲、仍甚穩定、證券交易一致回漲、錢業公會拆息、雖比前週升一分、純因供求關係所到、並非受謠言影響銀行聯合準備會公單拆息、及承兌匯票貼現率、與前週無異、外匯雖略有起伏、而變動甚微、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>銀錢拆息平靜如常</p>
<p>本市金融市塲、本週以來、大致平靜、錢業公會所開拆息、除星期日外、均掛九分、但較上週回升一分、此綠本週需現稍殷、完全爲供求關係所致、銀行聯合準備委員會所開公單拆息、始終掛牌一角、其承兌匯票之貼現率、亦無更動仍站在一角二分、於此可見上海金融穩定之一斑、</p>
<p>票據交換數額銳增</p>
<p>本埠銀錢業票據交換總額、均較上週銳增、銀行公會交換總數計國幣三七四·二九三〇五七·七二元、較之上期二〇七·四五一·八七八·〇六元、計增一六六·八四一·一七九·六六元、其交換數轉賬數、及代收總數、亦如總額之激增、錢業公會本週票據交換總額爲三一〇·九〇二·五〇〇元、較諸上期二九三·三四四·五〇〇元、亦增二七·五五八·〇〇〇元之多、</p>
<p>外匯行市稍見活動</p>
<p>本週上海外匯市況、稍見活動、英匯近期價爲一先令二便士三七五、按此價購進者頗鉅、惟國家銀行則盡量供給、極力穩定、是以英匯始終站住中央銀行之賣價、英匯遠期則呈緊縮、週四日英匯六月期、由一先令二便士三四三七五、縮至一先令二便士三一二五、七月期由一先令二便士三一二五、縮至二八一二五、至於美匯則反見鬆動、近期價由二十九元八一二五、長至二十九元八七五、遠期價於週三日起、各月皆長〇六二五、於週五日美匯六月期價、曾至二十九元八一二五、七月期至二十九元七五、按本週外匯趨緊原因、全由於日商銀行及華商之扒結、而月底金融比較緊張、亦不無影響、惟本週純商業交易較稀、銀行對做及投機賈買、則比較興盛、</p>
<p>法幣發行額數增加</p>
<p>中央銀行之發行額、根據週六之檢查報告、計二七七·七七五·二六四元、較之上期二七六·〇六四·八三六元、增加一·七一〇·四六元、現金準備亦有相當增加、卽九八二·八二八元、至中國交通兩銀行之發行額、根據發行準備委員會第六决檢査報吿、前者爲三四三·一五五·二八六元、後者爲二〇一·四〇一·七四〇元、現金準備亦均有相當保持云、</p>

<p>本年全世界、天文界轟轟烈烈之大事、卽為六月十九日之全日蝕、我國中央硏究院天文硏究所、亦特派員赴蘇俄伯力及日本北海道觀測、赴伯力之觀測員張鈺哲李衍、業於日前起程赴蘇、往日本北海道之日蝕觀測員陳遵媯·余靑松·二氏、於昨晨來滬當晚十二時、乘日郵船秩父丸赴日、申時社記者昨特往旅邸訪唔、茲誌所談如下：</p>
<p>日蝕意義地點經過</p>
<p>陳氏首述全日蝕之意義、謂地球環繞太陽一轉、卽為一年、月亮環繞地球一轉、卽為一月、兩者不息轉動、年復一年、約經過四百年之久、乃於固定之地點上、發現全日蝕一次、今年之全日蝕所經過之地點、起於歐洲之裏海、再過蘇俄之西伯利亞、赤塔等地、到我國黑龍江之奇乾、呼瑪、再至蘇俄之伯力、及日本之北海道、後入太平洋而沒、</p>
<p>全日蝕時大地昏黑</p>
<p>本月十九日下午三時左右、凡瑪利·伯力·北海道等、均為全日蝕經過之地點、全日蝕之時間、衹一分五十七秒、斯時太陽·月亮·地球·成為正視、天空高懸明朗之太陽、突被月亮遮沒、大地上立時昏黑、若圓月之夜然、閃爍之明星、均驚恐萬狀、狂鳴奔騰、吾人再仰觀天空、則見遮沒太陽之月亮之黑影、於月亮四週、射出月冕之光芒、此現象歷一分五十七秒後、月亮漸漸移過遮沒之太陽而恢復原狀、</p>
<p>遮黑玻璃觀偏日蝕</p>
<p>至日蝕之種類有三、太陽全被月亮遮沒者謂之全日蝕、遮沒一部分者名偏日蝕、遍沒太陽中心者名環日蝕、於六月十九日三時左右、不在全日蝕經過之地點、如上海南京各地等、此時如用塗淡黑墨之玻璃遮眼、以觀太陽、卽可見偏日蝕之形象、</p>
<p>觀測全日蝕之使命</p>
<p>陳氏繼謂、此次全日蝕、世界各國均甚重視、於蘇聯之伯力、及日本之北海道、各國之天文學家、雲集該地、予等觀測全日蝕之使命、一為硏究全日蝕形狀、及拍攝照片、其他則為參觀各國觀測全日蝕之儀器及日本如何招待各國視察員、以資一九四一年我國全日蝕時之借鏡、</p>
<p>我國全日蝕之預測</p>
<p>至我全國日蝕、曾於一五四二年（明嘉靖二十一年）時發現一次、約過四百年、至一九四一年、（民國三十年）又將發現全日蝕、其經過之地、由新疆起、經過甘肅·陜西·湖北·江西·達閩浙界、入太平洋而沒、</p>
<p>觀測專員昨晚赴日</p>
<p>陳氏末謂、我國赴日觀測隊、共計三人、予偕余靑松携觀測儀器十餘件如望遠鏡、計時表、電影機等、於三日晚、由京來滬、四日夜乘日輪秩父丸赴日、約十一日可抵北海道、尙有一人為留日學生、十六日觀測全日蝕後、再至東京等天文台參觀、本月底卽可返國云、</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>國旗乃民族精神之附麗國家人格的標幟</p>
<p>蔣委員長去年在成都講演國旗的意義、曾詔告我民眾曰、「國旗不僅是代表國家的神聖標幟、而且是我們整個民族、上自祖先黃帝·下至我們·以及將來千秋萬世子子孫孫的精神和生命集寄之處、」又說青天白日滿地紅的國旗、是我們中華民族自黃帝以來一脈相傳的總生命的表徵、亦是我們中華民國、自黃帝以來列祖列宗以及我們總理和一般革命先烈靈魂之所托、也就是我們四萬萬同胞共同的信仰之所集、所以我們要尊敬祖先、愛護國家、就要尊敬國旗、愛護國旗、我們一看到國旗、就等於看到我們國家和祖先、以及自總理以下一般為革命犧牲的先烈、就要肅然起敬、奮然興起、要在我們手裏繼續保持、並發揚光大我們祖先五千年來的民族生命和文化、救起我們的國家、復興我們的民族、使國族永遠飄揚於世界、所以、我們要尊敬國家、便當愛護國旗、我們要表示尊敬國家、愛護國家的精神、便當以尊敬國旗愛護國旗為起點、各國公民對於他們的國旗、莫不十分尊敬、備極愛護、故其國家觀念、民族意識、非常發展、而其全國民眾、尤能在統一的旗幟之下、互相敬愛、互相合作、互相團結、共同為國家民族的利益與光榮而奮鬥、及觀吾國、一般國民、非但對於國旗不知敬愛、且不知國旗為何物、致全國人民、無中心的信仰、無統一的意志、無團結的精神、大都自私自利、不知有國家的生存發展而奮斗、所以我們如果要挽救國難、復興民族、便當積極培養國民的國家觀念、與民族意識、而欲求國家觀念、民族意識之發展、就當以尊敬國旗、愛護國旗為起點、本市為全國文物發展之區、本市市民、對於國旗的認識如何、尤為中外觀瞻所繫、所以本市市民、平時對於國旗的式樣、國旗的意義、尤其應當有正確的認識、俾充分發揚我們中華民國的精神、</p>

<p>（上海工商業概況之二十七）</p>
<p>營業及概況——五金商品，旣多舶來，故經營者，須向本埠各國廠家之經理洋行定購、當定貨時，並無樣品，祇憑已往之式樣為標準。蓋各國對於商品，頗守標準化，例如某國某廠出品，定時祇須書明貨名，即無重大錯誤。其貨物重量，大多以噸計，或以羅（十二打）計或以箱計。市價方在，依照各該國幣制結算，故時有匯水之上落危險。運費，保險費，多由洋行算付，或在定貨時價值上加算。定貨到埠後，由經購洋行呈送知照單領取。貨欵介付，以貨到十天期之莊票換取提單。以上係向洋行定貨之大概情形。若係國內職品，則多由廠方或經理商家派員直接兜攬。至於商品銷路，本街及客路並重，本街多僱用跑街接洽成交，外埠各路，則函電成交；運輸費用歸客戶擔負，保險費由賣　方繳付，如有申莊者，貨物只須送達輪埠，由客方之報關行點收，其水脚及保險費，無用代付矣。不過其貨價上，當然比無申莊經手者，便宜若干。賬欵收取，本街以大小月底為多，惟亦有十天，二十天等期者。客路賬欵，以貨到付十天期匯票居多，間有三節清賬或月繳一次，若有申莊經手，貨物起運後，翌日即可收取。設有商品不符原樣，或貨價比他家昂貴，即可退回或割價，俗稱「打草子」。至於行政機關及私家之投標生意，則利益微薄，且須墊欵，通常商品出賣時之衡量，除固定份量者外，概照市秤計算，然亦有仍用司馬秤（即磅秤）者。其各業每年營業額，頗有最低這分。就中銅錫業，因銅錫原料市價吃重，故營業額亦大，最高達　百餘萬元，中等有六七十萬元至百萬元。次為小五金業！大抵自三十萬元至一百二十萬元。復次為大五金業，大者百萬元，中等四五十萬元。最少為鐵行業，蓋鋼鐵之價值底賤，故其營業額，最高約八九十萬元，下者二三十萬元而已。上海五金業門營業者，除銅錫業外，其他一業，多在沿街開設。銅錫業之門市店家，經售商品，均為製成之家用銅錫器具反響器等。（未完）</p>

<p>本市全國兒童繪畫展覽會、昨日下午七時、在致美樓招待本市各界、由該會籌備委員市敎育局局長潘公展、親任招待、並報告舉辦兒童畫展意義、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>歡宴來賓　應邀者、計申報·時事新報·大陸報·立報·大晚報·大美晚報·泰晤士報·新聞報·大公報·中華日報·民報·中央·大公社·國民社·曁市政府朱鳳蔚·陸樹屏·曁市政府吳利國·公共租界華人衛生局局長吳利國·公共租界華人敎育處陳鶴琴、市敎育局陳公素·蔣建白·胡叔異·馬崇　·邵汝幹、浙敎廳胡葆民·許望雲·中華藝術敎育社鄢克昌·馬公愚·中華慈幼會陳鐵生、</p>
<p>潘局長詞　席間同潘局長致詞、略謂今日承各界　臨、毋任感激、此次所舉行之兒童畫展、實屬創舉、其以研究提倡兒童繪畫、並啟發藝術興趣改進藝術敎育、現在各省市均有展覽品送交本會、以便陳列、務希各界、屆時均能蒞臨指敎、俾得隨時改進、再此次所徵集者、最注意於是否兒童所自繪、俾不致有失此會之眞義、</p>
<p>省市代表　該會此次場內一切佈置、除出美術專校派有同學數十人在場協助外、計江蘇省有代表負責辦理、計江蘇省沈萼樓傅伯良、南京市湖北省江西省施文彬朱士芹、河南福建山西山東四省鄢克定、湖南安徽二省、青島市譚傅闓、上海市綏遠省朱允松等、激蕩省胡葆良等、廣東朱允松等、</p>

<p>該會籌備員兼評判股長鄢克昌氏、昨特向記者發表意見如次、</p>
<p>最初建議　年來我國社會、對於兒童事業、漸次加以注意、因兒童是綿延民族生命的種子、兒童敎育良否、有關民族前途的盛衰興亡、故政府有全國兒童年之創設、藉以喚起國民對於兒童事業之注意、一年以來舉辦關於福利兒童的事業甚多、中華藝術敎育社、以兒童繪畫足以陶冶兒童性情、啟發兒童思想、培養兒童創力、乃建議舉辦全國兒童繪畫展覽會、二日在測騐兒童心理活動的狀態、藉知其智力之高下、為兒童一切敎育實施之本、經通過由六個有關係團處聯合籌備、</p>
<p>展覽主旨　此次兒童畫展之旨趣有二、（一）啟發兒童藝術興趣、培植審美本能、發揮創作天性、（二）研究兒童藝術傾向、測騐想像能力、為改進兒童敎養之助、基上宗旨、故此次畫展、純為測騐研究性質、絕無成績考查及競賽竟義、出品之優劣、與兒童敎師及家長無榮辱關係、故在徵集出品之初、深恐尚有狃於積習、仍以爭奇眩異為務、故一再言明選頭出品應充分注意兒童之創作品、</p>
<p>審查意見　此次各方之出品以一省市為單位、譜藉以觀察其地方藝術的傾向、到審查結束計到二十八單位、出品敎量約千餘件、出品數量雖多寡懸殊、而邊遠省區均有出品參加、當審查之際、仍本一貫主張、以未合標準者、不取、欵非學生自製者不取、審查之結果、計入選之出品三分之一、茲針參加審查人員共同之意見、分甲乙兩項、提出數點如下、（甲）符合標準之點、（一）幼稚生·低年級等、中年級生多為活潑佳趣、（二）少數地方尚能發揮地方特性、（三）一部份出品頗具新生活敎育意義、或民族思想之表現、（乙）未合標準之點、（一）少數地方敎法尚嫌　陳腐、取材多仿俗流、（二）臨本及潤色或成人授意之作太多、失兒童純眞創作性、（三）缺少鄉土敎材、</p>
<p>作品過少　以上各點不過係普通之觀察、至精確之意見當待評判之結果、惟以全國受敎育兒童數為一千二百二十二萬強、本會徵品細則、原定每百兒童中選取富有創造性之作品五件、預計全國出品、當在五十萬件以上、今出品尚不及十分之一、足證吾國藝術尚未能普遍、且尚有少數單位、截至目前、亦尚無出品、此誠出於吾人意料之外、</p>

<p>— 槐</p>
<p>第十一屆世界運動會快要在本年八月一日至十六日在德國柏林舉行、我國這次竟下了這麼大的決心、派這麼許多選手去參加、還有派兩個考察團隨同赴德考察、眞令我們十二分的欣慰、足球隊已先期出國了、籃球隊也已經過了久長的合宿訓練、田徑賽先在北平開訓練班、創造不少的優秀紀錄、現在全國的好手已集合上海、定明後兩日在申園舉行全國預選、至少預選選十二名健者出席世運、這時期、整個的體育界都亟切注意這次的預選、如若把歷屆世界運動會的成績、趁這時期分類整理出來、給全國的運動家體育家和民眾們看看、我想比任何應時的文章比較實際而有意義得多、在這裏我們可以看看世運會最先幾次的成績怎樣、近年來幾次的成績怎樣、並世界競技界進步的歷程怎樣、同時我們可以作一個自我的比較、確定我們的信心、向前邁進、我們並不是沒有希望的、</p>
<p>世界運動會是四年舉行一次、自一八九六年經法國專供希臘文獻的寇佩汀氏復興至今、恰正四十週年、先後共集會十次、但一九〇六年因希臘政府的特別邀請、曾在希臘舉行一次特別會、歐洲方面有許多國度沒有參加、即如參加之國、所派的選手、也不是全國的最優秀份子、故這次集會、並不在正式世運會次數裏計算、一九一六年原定在德國舉行第六屆大會、當時正在歐烽火迷漫之下、沒有開成、實際上世界運動會只開過九次、到今年柏林之會是第十次、因為第六屆沒有舉行這也應該說明的</p>
<p>下面所關於田賽之部的成績、都用的英尺制、因為我所根據的一本書、是一九二九年加拿大的奧林匹克委員會出席荷蘭第九屆世運會的報告書、這本書裏所載各屆的田賽成績、都是用的呎、我沒有找到其他用「米突」的書本、所以只能根據加拿大的報告書概以「呎」計、</p>
<p>又每屆每項運動的優勝選手的英文原名、概刪去不用、全照譯音、好在我們的主要目的在看他的成績、姓名乃在其次、</p>

<h3 id="c179">我對於敎師的希望 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>一年一度的敎師節又到了、當此全國敎師歡欣鼓舞舉行慶祝的時候、我有兩點希望、</p>
<p>第一、我希望敎師們多多注重人格上的修養、我們知道、一個健全的師資、非特要具備豐定的學識、尤其是要有完滿的人格、有優良的人格、才能取得學生的信仰、才能得到社會的同情、在慶祝敎師節的時候、我希望教師們對於自身多加檢點、務須養成具有優美品格的師資、</p>
<p>第二、我希望敎師們應當不斷地進修、因為社會是一天天的進步、新的知識也一天天的增加、如果不繼續地進修、那麼不久就要成為一個時代的落伍者、所以、敎師們在公餘之暇、應當多讀書報、對於有關本身的學科必須多加努力、對於一般的知識也不必忽略探討、如果能這樣進修、敎師們就永遠可以站在時代的前面了、</p>
<p>在國難嚴重的今日舉行敎師節、尤有偉大的意義、我希望敎師們非但是一個健全的師資、而且能成為復興民族的前鋒、</p>
<h3 id="c180">今日敎師之使命 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 陳公素</p>
<p>一國敎育之良窳、關繫於一國之盛衰者、一方面固不能脫離智識之啟發、他方面則尤當注重精神之訓練、啟發智識與訓練精神之責任、在乎敎師、故敎育之良窳、又視敎師之能否實負荷其使命以為歸、</p>
<p>今日之中國、厄矣、蔑以加矣、內憂未泯、外侮日亟、危機四伏、國難日深、而龐大之羣眾、則猶多未覺醒也、渾渾噩噩、不識不知、個人與國家之關係、毫無所感者、所在多是、祇知有個人利害、不知有國家利害、寧可犧牲民族之利益、以保全其個人之利益者比比然也、民族意識之消沉如此、誠至堪憂慮之事、而藉敎育之功能、改造國民之心理、因以發揚民族意識、以挽救國家之淪亡、自亦成為今日至、迫切之需求矣、</p>
<p>就敎師之任務言、其敎學與訓育之工作、俱有至高之價值、而訓育之重要、則甚或居敎學之上、未敎學者傳授知識、啟發知識之謂也、學術賴以昌明、文化賴以推進、國民之程度賴以提高、其有關於一國之前途者至為鉅大、其重要不言而論、至訓育則所以陶鑄人格、鍜練精神者也、其目的在使受訓者養成高尚之品性與偉大的志趣、其影響所及、更足以變化氣質、移風易俗、夫人之有才而缺其德者、其對於社會國家之貢獻、往往不及德勝於才之人、彼甘心以國家利益為犧牲者流、非盡屬不才者也、無德故耳、故負敎育之責任者、與其造就才勝於德之人、毋寗造就德勝於才之人之為愈、</p>
<p>現在學校之敎師、丁此時艱、服務敎界、眞所謂「任重道遠」、其工作之成績如何、對於民族前途之關係最為密切、是以敎師努力本職、即所以報答社會、吾人於此、除希求社會認識敎師地位之重要、並取得工作之保障外、尤冀凡為敎師者、應以最大之決心、抱犧牲之精神、盡瘁敎育事業、以學不厭敎不倦的態度敎人、用「以身作則」的精神訓人、以敎育的方法達到改造社會的目的、果能其赴標的、則努力之結果、可使救亡圖存之工程、早日完成、而吾民族之前途、於焉有望、固不僅造就優秀之青年已也、</p>

<p>— 蔣建白</p>
<p>所謂識字敎育、又肅清文盲的敎育、完全為成人之失學者而施、它與補習敎育不同的、是受補習敎育的人入過學、他所要補怒容的為某種特殊智識、受識字敎育的人未入過學、他所要補習的為一般文字認識、及公民訓練常識指導所以識字敎育等於成人底小學敎育、</p>
<p>中國經濟落後、文化落後、所以文盲特多、他們不能看報、不能看書、在反帝國主義的宣傳上極感不便、又因為他們不能看書報、沒有智識、所以世界觀狹小、對於政治漠不關心、以致民族力量分散、不易集中、因此、肅清文盲、提高他們底文化水凖、無欵是非常重要了、</p>
<p>現在全國各地都在努力識字敎育、掃除文盲運動、我們身為敎師的人、除了盡忠本身職務以外、對於這種切合國家需要的識字敎育工作、應該多多的倡導宣傳贊助服務、以期普及敎育之早日完成、</p>

<p>— 陳</p>
<p>一九三六年、誰不知其是一非常時期、在此非常時期特種敎育問題、已引起全國敎界人士的注意了、國難敎育、並不是在國家整個敎育之外、再創立一種特別的敎育、不過是將原來的應付百年來國難未曾得著效果的敎育、加以損益、有所著重、使切中時艱、而能充分發揮　救國難的功能罷了、換句話說、「消耗國力的敎育、是不合於國難時期的需要、培養國力的敎育、纔配稱作國難敎育、」、國難期間的敎育、之要點、敎育部王部長已有明確的指示、一為體格的訓練、二為精神的訓練、三為特殊智識及技能的訓練、在此「國難期間敎育」之下、我們做敎師的人、更能應夙夜匪懈、加倍努力、以求達到國難之挽救、民族之復興、</p>
<h3 id="c184">非常時期敎師應有的新精神 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 馮一先</p>
<p>九一八後國難日益嚴重、現在是已經到了國家危急存亡的非常時期了、非常時期、應辦非常時期的敎育、非常時期的敎育應怎樣辦、不是僅敎學生讀幾本平時的敎科書、不是僅敎民眾識幾本平時的千字課、乃是敎他們快快增進如何為國家防禦敵人飛機大砲毒氣彈猛烈攻擊的能力、</p>
<p>非常時期敎育是敎師領率學生練習吃苦的敎育、是準備抵抗風雨冷熱饑渴和敵人飛機大砲猛烈攻擊的敎育、是在衣食住行裏表現一心一德共赴國難的敎育、空談是無用的、惟有幹、才是對的敵人的海陸空軍來了、八千萬方里的領土已失去了、復興民族、人人有責、不要怨天吧、不要尤人吧、敎師們先進來、精誠團結、在大處著眼從小處著手、領導民眾、領導學生、苦幹、實幹快幹、繼續不斷的幹、</p>

<p>一年容易又屆民國二十五年之敎師節矣、夷攷敎師為吾國敎育界諸同志所創設、蓋以吾國敎師之待遇、至為菲薄、甚至個人衣食問題、不能解決遑論仰事俯蓄之計、生活之苦、可謂極矣、但其所負之責任、則為灌輸學生之知識、陶冶兒童之品性、建築復興民族圖強雪恥之基礎、責任之重、可謂至矣、責任之重如此、待遇之薄如彼、是以敎育界諸同志有敎師節之創設、藉以喚起社會之注意與同情、一方俾各敎師得此機會、歡叙一堂、為他山之攻錯、檢討已往之成績、反省過去之得失、決定將來敎學興革之方針、努力於自身學問道德之修養、以樹優良之師表、則創設此節日之意義可知矣、豈徒舉行儀式而已哉、爰不揣譾陋、謹責一言、以當祝辭、幸垂鑒焉、</p>
<p>（一）查敎育為立國之基礎敎育普及、則國民之知識程度高、愛國心濃、幫東西各國對於敎育經費·力求充裕·而吾國則反是、所以敎育事業奄奄一息此種現象端賴吾輩敎師設法補救、補救之道、惟有含辛茹苦、積極奮鬬、使敎育成績、日新月異、以引起社會人士之信仰與崇拜如是則敎育經費之籌措自易、敎育普及之達、此就敎於諸同志者一、</p>
<p>（二）韓昌黎有云、「師者所以傳道、受業解惑也」、可知為敎師者、不單在敎學生讀書尤須使學生知立身處世之道、博學之審問之·愼思之·明辨之·明禮義·知廉恥·負責任守紀律、故今後之敎學方針·必須就傳道、受業解惑、方面著力、勿復咿唔佔畢於章句、此就敎於諸同志者二、</p>
<p>（三）　昔敎師對於學生、多以敎之讀書為盡能事、所以學生一出校門、投身社會每致無所措手足、故敎師對於學生、除敎讀外、尤須予以實習及自治之機會、一面養成勤勞之習慣、勇敢之精神、堅忍不拔之意志、廉潔之操守、敏於事而愼於方、使異日投身社會、應付裕餘、無　格不通之病、學以致用、庶毋背於敎育之旨、此就敎於諸同志者三、</p>
<p>（四）吾國目前所處之環境、至險目惡、危機四伏、千鈞一髪、敎育方針、自應因事制宜、中等以上學校軍事訓練、及軍事管理、蓋有深意存乎其間今後對於學生務應激發其愛國思想、側重軍事敎養、信仰三民主義、服從領袖命令、更須養成其苦幹、硬幹、百折不撓之精神、此就敎於諸同志者四、</p>
<p>以上所論、乃一得之愚、願我同志共勉之、還望諸同志發抒偉論進而敎之、則幸甚矣、</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>傍晚拖一身的困倦，從工作處回來，春日的陽光落得那樣早，越發覺得這嘈雜湫溢的寓所充滿了寒冷，但按鈴時的心頭又浮上了層喜悅：卡邊卡夫回來了沒有？我那相識了才不到半個月的異國的街坊。</p>
<p>房東女人抿着滿嘴的阿芙蓉的煙霧來開門了，為了昨天才把拖欠了一星期的房租給了她今天的臉色好看了點，自己也不自覺地堂皇了點，不像前幾天那樣躱避一個伸着巨爪撲過來的惡魔似的鬼鬼崇崇了。</p>
<p>「三樓亭子間的先生回來了嗎？」忍不住了。</p>
<p>「嘔，那羅宋小鬼，搬了哪，便宜了他十天房租……」</p>
<p>我空着的右手搭上了她的瘦肩膀，差不多是狠狠地拍了一下，心裏罵着：煙鬼，你好，全是你遍去了的！</p>
<p>她　　了一下，瞪着眼：「怎麼的啦，一樣看待，我不能讓他住不花錢的房子！」</p>
<p>「你該先告訴我啊！」我好容易迸出業，臉上的紅潮退了。</p>
<p>「哦，倒忘了，他有一個紙條留給你的，在我那煙舖上。」她回過身去拿了。</p>
<p>我回到自己的亭子間，來不及捻燈，忽遽地湊着窗前的　暮的光亮展開了卡卡留給我的短箋。</p>
<p>紙上是一顆熾烈的心，兩隻擒着淚的眼睛。</p>
<p>他向我道歉，致謝，並且祝福我的健康，最後他說他永不忘記在他的流亡的生活中飽受到的蔑視與訕笑裏，我所給與他的一縷僅有的淡水般的友情。</p>
<p>最後，他祈求我原諒他突然的奔逃，實在是被璉不過才這么麼的幹的，並且還提到了我曾幫助過他的幾次的錢，這使他疚心，慚歉。</p>
<p>「也許是在任何一個馬路犄角，你會碰到我，不過我會遠遠地逃開你，不使你見了我難受。」他的句子寫得特別簡短，為的是使我能懂，他能寫一筆靈秀的祖國文字，和這個清　頹唐的流浪者一樣，那些字跡只是婉約，少了一點點兒活力。</p>
<p>我把短箋反覆地讀着，好像想發見另外一些字句一樣：或者有一天他會搬回來，重重作着溫暖的隣舍——我們是隔了一層樓板的隣舍，各自佔據了一個亭子間，他聽得我的長期的嗆咳，我聽得到他的午夜的焦灼的蹼　。</p>
<p>然而白紙上再沒有什麼別的話語，我只髣髴在看見那雙灰灰的深凹的眼睛在凝視，無奈目光裏飛出了悠長的太息。</p>
<p>拿起桌上的卡卡借給我的露西亞故事集，那裏面全是些淺近的夠叫人展一展眉的小故事，每晚卡卡敎我讀一個，他是那樣地認眞，替我校音，替我講解文法，當我永遠捲不起舌來唸一個「八」音時，他是抓着頭髪地着急，當我把那個句子作通順了時便拍拍我的肩說：「很好」</p>
<p>他也能講一點粗淺的上海白，我第一次認識他時是在一爿小小的水菓店門前，是早上，走過店門前時只聽見一些夥計們的訕笑：</p>
<p>「買勿起，覅買！」</p>
<p>「窮猪玀，洋　三！」</p>
<p>簡卡卡是默默地站在水菓攤前，眼對着一撮一個銅板一只的小而糲的橘子。把一雙手摸索着那身鼻煙色的破西服的褲袋，眼睛沉沉地像是死凝住了一樣。</p>
<p>輕輕地，一雙左手揑了兩個銅板出來，躱開夥計們的騰在空氣裏的訕笑，仔細地檢了兩雙走了。</p>
<p>連左近的路人全嘻嘻地笑了起來，這陌生的朋友卻頭也不回地踽踽地走了，牆上照着他的修長的微傴的影子。</p>
<p>就在過後不多幾天的傍晚，從外面回來時走過房東的房門口，意外地那個修長的個子又在面前了。</p>
<p>我怔住了，他也好像吃了一下驚，隨又面靦腆羞怯地轉過頭走了。</p>
<p>好容易才聽清了是房東在向他要房租。</p>
<p>「弗有拉裏，」他拍拍衣袋，又夾了一句自己的語言：「湼特，湼特！」（沒有，沒有！）</p>
<p>原來他和我作了一個多月的不相識的鄕隣了呢。</p>
<p>當他辦完了交涉，我們便在扶梯邊相識了，當他發現我也學習過幾個月他們的語文時，他活潑地笑了，強我說着帶着文法上的錯誤的他的語言。</p>
<p>我們用孤寂和相互的貧窮來作了友誼，時常訴說着各自的疲困，我總用年青人的滋長者荊棘的途中的一顆熱心鼓舞着他，有時他也抿抿嘴角，有時——特別是談到他的新的祖國時，他總搖搖頭。他說他也知道那是個前所未曾有的樂園，只是……</p>
<p>是紳士的架子吧？</p>
<p>「總好像，那是隸屬於我的——」</p>
<p>我用善意的笑駁他。他允許總有一天會拍拍掉這舊的枷，跨進新的家，新的祖國。</p>
<p>可是暫時地，他還是三天兩日地跑出去找找比他舒適的舊日的同伴，得一些資助過日子。也偶而地有幾天拿出幾角錢來告訴說這是他用工作掙來的，他怎麼工作，却不說了，却總是激熱地向我說：</p>
<p>「你好好工作，工作會使人忘憂的！」</p>
<p>我放下這張告別的短箋，翻開那本故事集，不知道是什麼時候他已經偷偷地在首頁題外了幾行字，最後歪歪扭扭地塗着幾個大字：</p>
<p>「卡卡給阿曉。」</p>
<p>這幾個漢文是我曾在燈光下提着他的手敎過他的。</p>
<h3 id="c188">日落前 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 文若</p>
<p>——埠頭速寫——</p>
<p>湖像耐不住過分的寂寞一般，悄悄地舞動着她底碧綠的輕衣；金球似的太陽已經快聯會墜落到「岳王廟」底屋頂上了。埠頭密密地擁着一排黃黃黑黑的船，遠遠望去，只見水面上浮着幾排不很整齊的灰黃的特地籐椅，就像戲院裏的坐位一般，中間還夾着幾隻白得耀眼的「沙發」，顯得怪不調和。</p>
<p>橋脚邊的柳樹下躺着一條棺材似的大石墩，上面橫七堅八地擠着一堆人。大家好偈連閒談的材料也談完了，都只默默地眺望着那並不深遠的馬路，希望再有幾個主顧會出現；只有沒家沒累，餓着肚子還是會鬧頑笑的十八九歲的金錢，却正扯着那一塌黃一塌黑的灰布棉袍，獨自像蹺　鷄般跳呀跳地在舞蹈，嘴裏哼着：「哎唷唷，柳青青……」聲音尖得怪刺耳。</p>
<p>「噁！」蹲在石墩上的根水舉起那樹皮一般的手搜住喉管裝惡心：</p>
<p>「好咧，好咧，小鬼！聽人家唱心會癢，聽你唱只會肉麻——等歇連骨頭都酥了，有生意也劃不來哩！」</p>
<p>「呵？你放心，不會有生意把你划咧，還是聽我唱唱開開心！」</p>
<p>金錢停住脚說了幾句，又歪歪扭扭地跳着哼起來了。</p>
<p>「金錢，可惜你袴襠裏多了一條東西啦！」額上刻着「九溪十八澗——這是同夥們給他取的大號——的寶和說；聾聳顋，那額上的皺紋立刻就深得看不到底，同夥們都曉得；他是在笑了。」</p>
<p>「你沒有那條東西，我包你不唱」「柳青青柳紅紅生意也一定好！」他接着說。</p>
<p>「金錢，割了它，寶和包你生意好！」根水跳下石墩推了金錢一把。</p>
<p>「不相士，這倒是眞話，大青娘來起來生意一定好！」寶和擺出了一向慣擺的老前輩的架子：「哪，嘉興，船都是女人家划的，打扮得蠻蠻漂亮，金簪兒金戒指——我們也要弄弄這個花樣，包你生意一定好！」</p>
<p>根水忍不住　，先嘻嘻地低聲笑起來。金錢只撕開嘴巴歪扯着臉，說：</p>
<p>「只怕你沒有吤漂亮的老婆，打扮起來也活像個」「大姆媽——還沒有我漂亮！」</p>
<p>「哈哈……」大家都哄笑起來。</p>
<p>石墩的後面，分陋着裏湖和外湖的長蛇似的白隄上，清澈地響着格格的脚步聲。</p>
<p>他們立刻都忘了剛才的玩笑，緊張地從石墩上站起來，張大喉嚨喊着：</p>
<p>「舢板要哇？舢板要哇？」一樹青年的外國男女，標揚着薄薄的花呢大衣，舞着「司的克，挺胸突肚地走過來。」</p>
<p>「舢板要哇？三毛大洋一個鐘頭！」</p>
<p>根水起勁地喊着跳上前去，伸出三個指頭。</p>
<p>但是，洋人只嗞嗞咕咕地談着，頭也不偏一偏，直向公共汽車站走去。</p>
<p>根水只好垂着頭，回到了石墩蹲着。</p>
<p>「洋人現在好像也窮了，洋生意眞難做得着！」寶和清一下喉嚨，又擺出老前輩的架子。做着倒好的，他們只會講鐘頭，角子也不會用，一塊洋錢總是當十角——昨日子我就划着一主，三個鐘頭，講好十隻洋！」</p>
<p>他搖頭擺屁股地說着，好像現在還正划着這樣的好生意。</p>
<p>根水取下氈帽兒，搔着扁扁的後腦，就像想起了什麼心事似地緩緩地說：</p>
<p>「這樣的好生意，只有你們「沙發船」做！我們——」</p>
<p>「沙發船？」寶和立刻像觸了痛處一樣，深深地鄒起額上的「九溪十八澗」吼起來：</p>
<p>「為裝這短命的沙發，來陣十隻洋的會，現在弄得會鈿都付不出！」</p>
<p>根水望了他一眼，仍舊羨慕似地說：</p>
<p>「有得借，總是好的！」</p>
<p>「咳！是的，久債還是好！」他滿臉的笑容都不知溜到那里去了，只剩着一臉悶氣。</p>
<p>「格末，閒話少說，你昨日子做着好生意是實在的，請請客唻！」根水張大着嘴，把話兒轉了個彎。</p>
<p>「好，算數請你，晚上你自己盛飯來，到我家裏吃好菜！」寶和又得意起來了，好像說：「到底還是我寶和不錯！」</p>
<p>「有鯽魚，螺螄。」他補說：「八個銅板小鯽魚，有念一條，加上四個銅板葱；舖一批葱，加幾條魚，燜起來眞香味！」</p>
<p>「好，說過算數！」根水嚥了一大口口水：「一定來；飯不吃你的，我們晚上吃山芋。」</p>
<p>「我沒有份的呀？」金錢跳到了寶和的面前。</p>
<p>「下回請你！」寶和像哄孩子一般地拍着他底肩。</p>
<p>這時，半個大大的太陽已經消失在「岳王廟」的瓦背後，湖面上現出了一片的陰黯。兩個細長的身影慢慢地從寂靜的柏油路上移近埠頭來。他們已經看得清清靠右的一個戴着紅頂的黑絨瓜皮帽，藍袍子上閃着一縷縷的光；靠左的却穿着緊紥紥的西裝，露在大衣外的半截褲脚硬挺挺地像紙糊的一般。他們立刻又都從迷夢中醒來似地跳下了石墩：</p>
<p>「旋下去哇？」</p>
<p>「要不要叫划子？」</p>
<p>根水敏捷地搶上去：</p>
<p>「先生，划子要哇？」</p>
<p>「旗下多少？」那　反應皮帽的「先生」，懶懶地問。</p>
<p>「三毛錢，好吧？」</p>
<p>他搖換頭，立刻像逃一般加快了脚步。那穿西裝的徵側着頭輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「我看乘汽車吧，這班傢伙專門敲竹槓，不道德！」</p>
<p>「先生，多少才要咧？」根水緊緊跟在後面：「就是乘汽車也要兩角大洋呀，單划你兩個人，又沒有回頭生意的，要是從前四隻角子都沒有人要划哩！」</p>
<p>「從前？」戴瓜皮帽的冷笑起來：「現在年成沒有這末好！」</p>
<p>「格末，先生你說多少？」</p>
<p>「兩隻角子，去就去，不去拉倒！」他說了就扭轉頭</p>
<p>「好，好！去了拉倒哉！」</p>
<p>根水發狠地跺了一脚，一面跑去樹下解纜。</p>
<p>站在旁邊的西裝先生，連忙指着一隻裝西式沙發的船說：</p>
<p>「要這一隻！」</p>
<p>「這隻不是我的，」根水賠着笑臉：「籐椅坐也是一樣格！」</p>
<p>「哼，舊籐椅船，不要！不要！」</p>
<p>兩位先生挽着手就走。</p>
<p>「沙發船麼？四隻角子！」寶和的聲音從石墩上送過來根水恨恨地望着他們，很想一度日拳打過去，但是他忍住了：</p>
<p>「先生，怎樣啦，說好的」</p>
<p>「沙發船，兩隻角子。就要！」</p>
<p>根水牽着解下來的纜，呆呆地釘着他們的背影。</p>
<p>突然，寶和從石墩上來，一面用短促聲音喊着：「來來，划你去，沙發船」前面正在走的兩個人，回頭住了脚。</p>
<p>寶和連忙俯下腰去解纜。</p>
<p>根水心裏一怔，「咳，連寶和都來搶我的生意！」但是，他只好冷冷地說：</p>
<p>「你去？——那還要裝啥沙發！」</p>
<p>寶和却不在意地將破呢帽略按一按，甩起那發典的染滿了汚漬的布棉袍後擺，塞在腰上，一面坐上船，一面搖頭：</p>
<p>「不去？他眞不肯加的，倒反大家撈個空！」</p>
<p>根水望着那兩個客人，分坐上兩面的彈簧椅上，當中小圓桌上的金色茶壺在閃光，槳一下下地搖進那魚鱗似的水裏。他心裏一急，就直着喉嚨喊：</p>
<p>「旗下去哇？旗下開船哩？」</p>
<p>這時，榮生和金錢都慢慢地走過來，收起船上擺設的籐椅，榮生一面咕嚕着：</p>
<p>「一天，只划得個五十個銅板！」</p>
<p>金錢正拆下籐椅捧向家裏</p>
<p>「五十個？還好！老子只三十個咧！」</p>
<p>根水沒答嘴，嚀了一把鼻涕，往油餅似的布襖上一抹，又撕聲地喊着：</p>
<p>「旗下去哇？十個銅板！」</p>
<p>從那寬闊的柏油路邊轉過七八個男男女女來，都是穿着布襖的鄕佬，他馬上迎着</p>
<p>「要不要到旗下去？」</p>
<p>「幾個銅板一個人？」灰黃的氈帽下加了一對耳朶套的十七八歲的小夥子問。</p>
<p>「算八個垃倒哩！」</p>
<p>「八個？」紥着黑包頭的中年婦人揷進來說：「人家五個！」</p>
<p>「六個！六個！」</p>
<p>「你又來咧！」用粗粗的雨傘柄背着一個藍布大包袱的中年男人，狠狠地看了那女人一眼：「就是五個，五八得四十，也快要兩隻角子，走走末好哩！」</p>
<p>「五個就五個，依你！」</p>
<p>根水跟上去。</p>
<p>但是，那一夥人沒有一個停住脚。聲音只在灰黑色的天空和淺黃色的湖面上蕩了一轉，又重新折進根水自己底耳朶裏。</p>

<h3 id="c190">新詩的歧路 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 任鈞</p>
<p>雖然這是一個火血交流的世界，雖然這是一個不折不扣的「詩的時代」，雖然到處了我們需要時代歌手的熱切呼聲；但，可怪的是：這幾年來的詩壇竟異常落寞，消沉，令人有滿目荒涼之感。</p>
<p>為什麼會有這處現象呢？這，自然，正如整個文壇之衰落一樣，原有其客觀上的種種雜多的因素，是頗有一方難盡之勢的；但，我始終以為：新詩本身包含着許多不正確的傾向，換言之，就是，新詩人有意無意地走了上各種「此路不通」的歧路，起碼應該是造成這一現象的最大原因之一。</p>
<p>好，現在就讓我們來把那些不正確的傾向，那些歧路，加以檢討和指摘吧。</p>
<p>記得露西亞的偉大的批評家倍林斯基曾說過如下的話語：「誰都有權利要求一個詩人，起碼在他的詩中，應該為着不能解決的問題傾注滿腔的悲痛。無視民眾，祇是為着自己，歌咏自己的事情的詩人，除開他自己之外，是一個讀者也得不到的」。——中國目前所處的是一個怎樣的時代呢？這「時代的痛切問題」是什麼呢？對於居常以敏感自詡的作家（詩人）們，這當然是些不成問題的「問題」。話雖如此，但不能不引起我們最大驚異的，目前中國儘有不少「優秀的」，「名望的」，「有才能的」詩人們還在那裏專門花呀，月呀，我的戀人呀……的歌頌自然，唱戀歌；或是滿紙孤獨呀，寂寞呀，夢呀，幻呀……的在那裏專門表現一種無病呻吟式的世紀末的情緒。顯然地，這些詩人都由於受着所屬階層的生活和意識所制約，都不能或不願把握正確的人生觀和世界觀；因此，他們在這一大時代之前，就不能不成為色盲，聾漢，或者努力裝作若無其事地閉上眼睛，掩上耳朶；他們已然看不見滿地的災荒，迫害，凌虐，……也聽不見敵人的砲聲和苦難的大眾的悲號，怒吼……結果，對於他們，失戀就比失去了東三省，熱河，甚至全中國，還更值得悲哀，痛心！完全屬於個人範圍的所謂孤獨和寂寞，也要比大眾的任何疾苦跟災難還更值得被表現，被描繪！你想，像這種「無視無民眾，祇是為着自己，歌咏自己的事情的詩人」，怎能產生出那些反映和表現時代的偉大作品出來呢？怎能獲得讀者是們的同情和愛護呢？而這種詩人一多，詩壇又怎能不荒涼呢？……</p>
<p>這，可以說是新詩之內容方面的應該給與最無情的打擊和糾正的一種惡傾向。其次，在形式和表現方面，我們也可以找出那些同樣地應被打擊和糾正的傾向來。</p>
<p>第一，就是那從形式主義出發，極力想把新詩格律化，定型化的傾向。祇要稍為留心過詩壇動向的人，都會曉得：不論是過去和現在，都有着不少的詩人在那裏大做其西洋風的什麼體或是什麼格的詩歌；於是，結果，就產生了不少的所謂十四行詩，「方塊詩」等等。很明顯的，這乃是一種想要把新詩格律化，定型化的企圖；也就是新詩運動上的一種墮落和復辟，一種新的鎖鍊和鐐銬。固然，我們并不反對人家留意形式；正相反地，我們也承認：一個詩人，他有充分的權利去尋求最相宜的，最完美的形式來表達一種特定的內容；我們也未嘗不瞭解，一首好詩，不光是由於它的內容豐富，充實，同時也由於它的外形的完整和美妙。不過，在這裏，須得注意的，就是：我們對於形多的強調，絕漢有超乎形式對於內容的從屬性，或是內容對於形式的優位性這一原則。因為我們始終認為：如果你的肉體是健美的，那就縱然是一絲不掛的裸體也沒有什麼妨礙，甚或因此還更顯得你的健美；反之，你如果是個沒有血肉的「骷髏」，那就縱然穿上頂華麗的服裝，塗上三尺厚的脂粉，人家也將望而却步。而且，更進一步說來，正如周知的一般，一種呆板的，固定格式，的確會給內容以最大的束縛和桎梏。我們為什麼要拋棄舊詩詞呢？那就是因為它的種種不合理的限制和格律，實不容我們表達現代人的思想和感情之故。自然為，你也許會說，商籟體之類并非我國舊詩詞的形式，而是貨眞價實的，道地的來路貨·可是，你得明白：對於我國婦女之「國粹的地」纏足，穿耳，我們固然絕端反對；但，同時對於她們之一西洋風的地」穿高跟鞋，燙頭髪，我們也絕不贊成；因為在「不自然」，一矯搡造作之點上，那些原是半斤八兩啦。——總之，這種把新詩定型化，格律化的企圖，拆穿西洋鏡，乃是一種削足適履的辦法，一種想要借形式來掩飾空虛內容的把戲，它會使好容易才跳出舊詩詞的泥坑的新詩，重新投進一種新的陷阱中去。</p>
<p>第一，就是把詩作寫得非常晦澀曖昧的傾向。這幾年來，中國新詩壇上很出現了些所謂象徵派，神秘派，意象派……等等的詩人們。據說他們寫作的動機，純粹為着要表現一種輕淡迷離的情趣，意象和剎那間的感興。他們的作品，讀起來，不但滿紙「嗎吧呀呢，」令人好像在聽外國人講中國話，或是在看一種笨拙生硬的從外國翻譯過來的文字；而且，不怕你很用心地讀完了他們的整篇作品，你也常常不曉得我們的「莫測高深的詩人們究竟在說些什麼？表現些什麼，讀了也等於不曾讀（可惜此刻因為篇幅關係，不能把他們的大作抄出幾首來，讓大家好聚精會神來猜一猜我們的詩人究竟在變些什麼戲法，弄些什麼虛玄）。一句話，就是：他們的作品，一般地雖是用白話寫的；但却異常晦澀，曖昧，使人幾疑為「天經」之類。這種作品之產生，也許我們的詩人們自有其「高明的」解釋和論據；但在我看來，則儘管彼此的派別不同，儘管彼此的花樣互異，而由於內容空虛，不能不在形式和表現上去翻筋斗，耍把戲，藉以掩飾這點上，他們正跟形式主義者們有其血緣關係。因為在事實上，正如批評家Mirsky所說：「許多詩人竭力使自己成為不可理解，是因為他們沒有什麼值得人家去理解的要說。」關於詩壇上的這種傾向，最近胡適之氏和梁實秋氏也曾特別那以指摘和批判，說那些看不懂的詩是個「笨謎」，是「一種墮落的文學風氣」，并且還說：「是人就得說人話，詩人也得說人話，人話以明白清楚為第一要義」（見「自由評論二十二期胡氏的「談談「胡適之體」的詩「和梁氏的「我也談談「胡適之體」的詩「和梁氏的」「我也談談」「胡適之體」的詩」兩文。）但邵洵美氏對於他們的評　却大不謂然，曾先後在「人言周刊」上面大寫其反駁的文章，並更進一步地引洋絕，據洋典，極務推崇所謂「偉大的晦澀」。不過，平心而論，晦澀亦稱「偉大」，則天下不偉大的東西也就未免太少了！</p>
<p>以上所指摘的一種傾向，可以說是新詩在內容和形式上的三條歧路。今後的詩歌如果再沿這些歧路走，那我敢說，它不但沒有復興的希望，而且，無疑地會跑到絕路上去！因此，希望獻身於詩運動的人們都能從理論或作品上用最大的力量去把它從那些歧路上拉回來！</p>
<h3 id="c191">懷鄕 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 辛勞</p>
<p>懷鄕在我成了病症。老懷念着，有時候很便我更加憂悒。當春天來了，我想起故鄕那初青的草地；水河爆裂的響聲；在那新溶化的泥濘的鄕間道上，許多　　脚和馬蹄陷來陷去；而積雪的山峯上的雪水流成了小的噴泉；眞是美麗呢！</p>
<p>儘管江南的春色秀麗，然而漂流在異鄕的人，是沾不到一點春的滋潤。</p>
<p>——故鄕的春是展放在遍地，沾染着每個遊子有感覺的心　當榴花紅滿了枝頭，夏天來了。只這酷熱，已竟使我難忘故鄕昔日的平和，坐在那青濛濛的山坡之上，蝴蝶在眼前飛舞，從山刺梅，從蒲公英，從山牡丹，再飛到山蘭的紫花朶中——蝴蝶，這里不是沒有的，也更美麗；祇是在懷鄕的偏情里，牠就減低了顏色。</p>
<p>路旁的　梧桐落下了葉子，這里是秋天了。我想起故鄕野草叢中的龍葵；當那小黑的菓粒吃到嘴里——多末有味的記憶哩，在我孩子的時代……</p>
<p>而冬天來了。故鄕的大雪最使我記憶和懷想。那雪掩蓋了高高的山，低低的草房　；站在田野的中央，眞會像置身無邊無際的雪海；冽風吹起的　旋，浪一樣的雪砂在飛翻；可是這里能見着多少雪的影子呢？很少的。</p>
<p>因着這，每個冬天，我都為雪焦渴着，我想故鄕那花朶一樣的大雪片。</p>
<p>然而，我懷念着的故鄕，那青青的山坡，是睡滿了屍首了；大地也怕在哀哭着吧？在××的殘酷屠宰下，麻雀怕也不能自由地跳躍了！</p>
<p>走過我舊日走過的小路，巡視着我往日住過的庭院……我將一一地指着說：這是我釣過魚的水溝；這是我堆過砂堆的河岸；這是我坐過的亭子；這是我跑過的山坡；這是我插過身的土地；這是我打過雀的樹林；這是……</p>
<p>假如到了這樣日子，我會，不，我該怎樣呢？想想吧！孩子一樣哭起來？或者打個滾，哈哈地笑？</p>
<p>然而，這日子是那末遼遠地每當這里剎剎拉拉地落起雨來，我就會想起故鄕的天空，六年了，是這樣陰　的，這樣凄寂的，這樣凄慘的。像我的心一樣，飄蕩灰色的雲。</p>
<p>故鄕什麼時候開晴呢？我的心什麼時候開晴呢？——禁不住我老是這樣想。這樣想。</p>

<p>昨華商證券交易所、因西南謠傳、未見證實、人心雖尚忐忑、祇以多數稍事拉抬、市價已稍稍回漲、出稍一放手、即有下降之處、目下多方實力、能否戰勝此環境、頗堪注意也、惟以統一復興兩公債、共有十八萬萬之多、空方交出三五千萬、尚屬輕而易舉、觀大戶之賣出、其背景素具實力、此亦不可防也、走私尚未杜絕、港豐又變動甚烈、交貨者頗不少、昨日經過、開盤卽為三十五及七十二·七十七號等買進而漲、比前日回好三四角、次盤即覺轉向、經北帮及十號之湧賣、旋卽下降一二角至三角半、午後多方稍事拉抬、故前列僅小二角左右、後列已為四號等抬上一二角、故四十七·及四十八號以及十一號得有善價賣出、收盤十一及五十四雖續有拋出、為數已稀、四號等以及散戶均有買進、多數再漲一角左右、市價結果、一致上漲一角至四角不等、成交總數、共計四百八十七萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>紗市轉挫、局勢稍疲、蓋以多方在近月掉期、賣出近月、收進遠月、故遠期市勢略帶緊昂、然本月份市氣較弱、其餘亦受其牽制、現紗麼路尚堪維持、售價久持平穩耳、</p>
<p>標紗本月跌勢稍熾</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以外棉漲風已定、而六　七月期多方賣出、掉進遠期、本月跌風雖熾、拍至遠期轉趨緊昂、場中交易未見十分踴躍、金業商及證券商又來購買、明德·大昌成等均買進一千餘包、賣出者係散戶為多數、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌二·五·六角、午後開盤各月平庸、日跌風微現、以有一部分多頭了結、結果各月比上午收盤價跌四·五·六角、查賣出森康四百五十包、錦昌四百包、興昌四百包、長餘四百五十包、潤康五百包、協成一千二百五十包、生源九百包、經華三百包、信誠一千〇五十包、買進通記九百五十包、聚興五百包、裕大一千一百包、明德一千三百包、振大四百五十包、賡豐一千六百包、愼昌一百五十包、大昶七百包、愼記七百包、同和五百包、一日間最高低價收盤價列下、</p>

<p>標花近月跌勢稍弱</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以英棉回跌三至八磅音、印棉停市、大阪三品花跌二·三·角、市塲人心平凡、而不易異常疲乏、且本月份絨無銷路·壓力頗重、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一·二角、午後開盤各月參差不齊、上下五分、二盤以後仍無甚大變遷、以現棉需要發達、人氣尚昂、結果一月比上午收盤價漲五分、遠月新棉跌五分、查賣出達記一各二百担、合興一千八百担、賡豐一千六百担、協成一千八百担、源興昌一千担、生源一千二百担、買進愼昌一千一百担、通記三千担、明德一千一百担、大昌成一千八百担、恒昌一千担、大昶二千二百担、信誠一千三百担、潤康二千四百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列如下、</p>

<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲跌二磅音、多頭了結、國內外同業限價買進、致成參差不定之避、旋以多頭了結及遠東賣出、市況疲軟、惜東部繼續缺雨、賣額均為新投機買進所吸收、廠家進胃亦較活動、七月與十月期間之差額、較前稍狹、囤棉處在一角一分六釐半時、售出七月期、午後多頭再度了結、兼以本地賣出、又形不振、收盤時、一部份補空、尚見平穩、計現貨不動、期除七月漲二磅音外、餘跌四至八膀音、英棉現貨漲五點、期貨漲二三點、印棉停市、原電錄左、（三日電）</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先俏後疲之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥微好四分、坎拿大好一二角不等、開價時因洋麥微好、天時亦晴雨難定、是以人心堅俏、本月份最高盤、曾至三元零六分半、遠期各亦隨好一分左右、惟至二盤、因散戶多頭、逐步出籠、致人心又復漸平、較最高回落一分左右、迨至下午開稩、交易甚消、因廠方略有出檔、遠期逐步見鬆、不過目下情形、大部份又因時避關係、及小麥尚未旺令之際、業內外均靜處觀變、非至供求間有實在消息、至須停頓一時云、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致平靜、因天時尚難暢晴、洋麥報價、微好一二角、故買賣雙方、均趨觀望、爭競旣少、上落逐稀、至本年小麥情形、北路因晴雨適宜、收穫確較往年為佳、且收割時日、亦反較南方為早、就此點推考、將來通檔時期、市氣難免變動矣、迨至下午開盤、因買氣頓切、出戶反稀、近期曾見略好、惟交易並不甚暢、未免缺少生氣、此後情形、必須新麥全部登塲、看廠胃及走銷如何、方有升沉云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、冬麥出產平均估計為五〇一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇斛、春麥出產平均估計為二三六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇斛、與預料者略等、西北天旱、有穩定價格效力、惟不久套賣即將發生影響、蘇俄之輸出亦引起若干恐慌、</p>

<p>是這個月的三日，「金陵健康小姐」可產生了，事情據說是這樣的：南京的金陵女子文理學院有鑒於今日女性之審美點，當在健康而不在外形，故有選舉一「金陵健康小姐」之運動。全校的同學與敎職員，都有選舉與被選舉權，選舉名額為七人，以得票數最多為當選，同時並另取次多三十名為「健康學生」。至其健康標準有四　　體內各部器官健全（由校醫檢騐），　各部姿勢正確，（並包括體重），　行動自然，不呆板，　精神活潑，舉動敏捷等。這運動或許是個創舉吧。本來，誰都知道還是不久以前的事！中國女子的「弱不禁風」是素來著稱的；甚而，一般認爲女子以常帶病態爲美的。所以在那時，一般大家閨秀們是要以嬌弱，「平坦美等」爲當時最「摩登」的「美態」。</p>
<p>然而，這是無用諱言的，幾千年來中國的女子，被壓服在封建制度毒害之下，作了這種種不合生理與衛生的繩足，束胸，緊腰，穿耳環，掛項等等的裝飾與打扮，以示媚美，而實則這許多遺傳的裝飾，却無意中給自己終日終年以至終身牢牢地束縛着不得自由的無形的枷鎖與桂梏雖然在「五四」以後，一部份的，女子們的纏足，束胸等枷鎖是得了解放；然而對於一般人的審美標準却仍以「媚」，「嬌」等為勝！</p>
<p>本來這個審美的標準，在前原是世界歐美各國人士所共有的。不過在現在，情形可不同了。記得英國的考察家戈爾氏曾這樣說過：「我人不能以昔日的審美目光，定女子美醜。昔日以美媚勝，今則須以健美爲標準。蘇聯女子現在以操作不讓男子，運動更有較男子勤奮者，俾彌補其體力上天然之缺憾。腰臀勻稱，腿臂丰腴剛娜。膚色在白紅之間，不施脂粉　充分表現天然之美。而其生活起居，在在較歐美女子簡單，亦其爲惟一美點。故認穌聯女子爲世界最美女子，實無疑點。」</p>
<p>不過在今日，年靑的女子們除了每個人都應解脫了昔日那種嬌弱的病態，而獲得了健而美的體格外，却更不可忘了作爲時代的新女性所應負的更重大的社會責任。要小然，那就不過是成了一個外表美好而依舊無用的軀殼而已！</p>
<h3 id="c215">潘玉良女士畫展 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 吳曙天</p>
<p>絲雨密密地下着，後來是漸漸的狂大了。我非常歡喜這樣的雨天，又因爲渴望已久的潘女士的畫展，恰在今天開幕，使我非冒兩出去不可。想到看畫展須邀兩個伴，便去邀了傅雪夫婦。</p>
<p>會址在愛麥虞限路的中華學藝社，這條路上是靜悄悄地，看不見什麽舖張，一般開展覽會的，總有許多大白布，橫豎地掛在街頭，今天却沒有看見。只是會址的門首，有一條橫布，被雨打濕了。</p>
<p>看看簽名簿上到了很多人，我們靜悄的走進第一列室，第一個印象，覺得畫太多太小，排列太密，而標卡又黑又大，將畫的鮮明掩去不少。第二列室就好得多了，在東牆邊上，有一張作者的自畫像，我很歡喜，那簡單的筆觸，稀薄的色彩，都能表現光色的奧妙。那樣稚氣的微笑，那種憨態，使我的情感立刻和她聯絡起來了。假如我和作者不是熟友，假如我沒有想到做偸兒是不好的，我想，我也許會偸走她的。</p>
<p>作者的出品有二百點，在這二百點中，可以見得作者年來的游歷與豪興，由法國回來以後國內山水名勝的的地方，到得很多了。一個畫家是和詩入文入一樣的，不走萬里路，不讀萬卷書，是沒有巨大的收穫。我相信一個作者的出品，對於他的思想，經歷，環境不是毫不相干的。我也相信，每一個作者的成就，都不是偶然的，而是有相當的經過與相當苦心的。</p>
<p>我看了潘女士的畫，更加相信努力的成就，纔是有生命的。作者的筆觸很矯健，同時也沒有遺忘細膩溫柔，很有大處着眼，小處用心的境地，而且善用灰暗的色彩，我們都知道畫家最怕用灰色，因爲灰色容易使畫不鮮明，但潘女士的技巧嫻熟，又大胆，她能以灰色反映畫的鮮明。</p>
<p>現在我要說一說潘女士的畫，給我怎樣領悟，怎樣的愛好。有許多山水畫中，如「黃山迎客松」，「奉化雪竇山三隱潭」，一華山蒼龍嶺」「靑島海濱」，構圖都很別緻，同時色値明暗，使每幅畫上生動，黃山的松是雄壯的，山嶺是巍然昂然的，海是有平靜有凶湧的。還有一幅「勞山白雲洞松」，更是靜穆偉大，天空的色彩寫得很好。</p>
<p>人物畫中，「苦力，「老妓」，「亡命者」，都是有生氣的，看上去，好像他們的細胞在那裏跳動着。我看了「苦力」，不知不覺的想到忍耐與飢寒。那辛苦的臉龐，多皺紋的削瘦的，頽唐而且勇敢，忍耐，他工作過了，勤勞過了，手上的一隻空籃，口中一隻烟袋，又表現了他的賣過苦力以後，一點欣慰與安適。「亡命者」，也是一幅强有力的作品，全身的肌肉，與臉上的表情，充分的表現着憂鬱，生命的掙扎的苦悶。但是「老妓」，却又表現出可厭，淺薄，無聊，可恥，而且可咀吮的靈魂，那是灰色的人生。我不能不佩服作者的玄妙而多變化的筆花。我覺得作者不是一個平常作者，她能領悟人生而參透心境，而且對於日常生活咀嚼玩味，時時在留意的。看完潘女士畫後，腦中不禁浮現一個俄國女友的面影，那是Lorskaya的面影，她的爽直，活潑，與努力的精神，正和潘女士一樣。Lorskaya她因爲同情於苦人，她天天在北京的前門一帶徘徊，有時她到工人區去畫苦人，回來便在小小的工作室塑雕，我記得有一大塊木板上，擺着許多塑雕，都是各種苦力的面影與身影。聽說，她現在已回俄國，不但成就了一個塑雕家，而且是一個畫家，一個女伶人。</p>
<p>我希望潘女士不但成爲一個畫家，而且成就一個有思想的文學家，因爲她很愛好文學。</p>

<p>— 茉莉</p>
<p>妻：你到了大馬路，不要忘記一件事。</p>
<p>夫：甚麽事？</p>
<p>妻：到五洲大藥房去……</p>
<p>夫：做甚麽？</p>
<p>妻：給家裏買幾種衛生品，現在等着用的，</p>
<p>夫：茶麽衛生品？</p>
<p>妻：我們現在常常要洗澡，所以離不開「五洲花露水」，「五洲爽身粉」請你各樣買一瓶。還有，這幾夜蚊蟲擾得人不能安睡，所以請你買幾盒「五洲蚊香」，再請你買幾瓶「五洲菓子露」，不要忘記。</p>
<p>夫：到了大馬路我决不會忘記。</p>

<p>我們可以淸楚看見浜底零亂的磚石和泥道。落潮時，急流的水花打着磚石發出一種微妙的音樂，激動的水泡循着磚石的隙縫一路打着水圈流到官河裏去。我和我的同伴是在那小河浜邊長大起來的。那邊有石級直伸到浜心裏，我們看着水的深淺坐在石級上玩耍。水對於每個孩子都發生很大的興趣的，夏天更是個最適合的季節，我們在坐在最低的石級上，四條腿沉浸在浜心裏，水花衝着我們的脚心。也曾在石級上睡過去，到醒來時候下半體已經完全浸着水了。但是我們喜歡水，大家偸偸地換了衣服，還是在石級上送走每一個黃昏。最使我們高興的是潮漲時候，因爲浜道狹小，我們把田園裏的大糞箕用大石塊壓着向潮來的方向張着大口，水從糞箕的竹縫裏流過，拖着並行的細條紋向後逝去，如果水勢激烈，那些細條紋會打成一片美麗的圖案，是不能以言語文字形容的。而被潮水帶進來的小魚，小蝦都拘留在糞箕裏了，我們把那些收獲品養在後園的一個大缸裏。沒有幾天，缸裏的魚蝦已大有可觀了，於是我們每天要分出一半時間到後園去拜訪它們。這事情被父親發現的時候，他很贊譽我們的智慧。父親是患着很厲害的心臟病，他遵守了醫生的囑咐每天靜臥在院子裏，很少走動，及知道我們在河浜上的捕魚法，他也常扶着手杖，令僕童移了籐椅，坐在空地上看着我們在石級上淘氣。但是父親要回屋裏的時候，總要我們跟着一同回家，不過他也知道我們沒有盡興，撫着我們的頭髮笑着說：我們到家裏做好玩兒去，眞的父親是那樣高興，他搬出養金魚的玻瑙缸來，缸底舖了種水仙的石卵，選擇幾尾比較活潑的小魚養在裏面。每天在燈下消遣着時光。</p>
<p>我的同伴是姑母家表妹。姑夫姑母都很早過世，父親因爲是姊妹的骨肉，扶養在家裏，和我一樣送學讀書。但是當表妹進中學那年，正是五四運動高漲的時候，那中學鬧了一决事變，表妹就此也失蹤了。父親爲了她幾乎暈厥過去，後來倒底鬱鬱於懐逝世的。臨終的時候，他握着我的手把蘊藏在心中的話都說了出來：她是聰明的女孩子，一定受了人家的欺騙，這許多年來沒有音訊，我死去對不起你姑母的，你要尋她回來！我本來想做媳婦的，這願望自然是落了空，不過一定要尋她回來！</p>
<p>父親死後，我四方探聽，但在這茫茫人海中不復得到一點我的河浜上的同伴的消息，許多年來，自己到處飄泊，幾乎忘了父親未了的心願：最近鄰居寄來信，吿訴我那方公地由有力者向地方當局設法廉價購買了，小河浜也塡了，現在正興工鳩木建造房屋。土豪劣紳的潛勢力要覇佔一塊公地，塡塞一條小小的河浜，在故鄕是常有的事，在他們末日未臨之前，他們的所作所爲祗有使我們忍氣吞聲而已。但是河浜上有我童年美麗的憧憬的，表妹不知飄流在什麽地方的時候，那小小河浜上已經要建造房屋了，使我又想起了父親的遺言，他的遺言恐怕終是落空的了。</p>
<h3 id="c219">草包 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 以一</p>
<p>這一連大串的草棚裏就住滿了二百八十一個草包。</p>
<p>年輕力壯的靑年男子們都給挑選出去築公路了，這裏就只剩下這些只能吃飯而毫無用處的女人們，小孩，和老頭子。</p>
<p>他們每人都有家鄉，都有美麗而豐潤的田野，在田野裏開出了他們底生活的慾望，他們都是爲了牢牢地把握住那個活生生地希望而愉快的流下了血和汗，把辛勤的勞力深深地埋入芬郁的十壤中，而后在疲勞而堅張的臉上抽出了一絲絲地天眞的笑容。</p>
<p>不都是這個樣嗎？由大量的勤勞中去發掘希有的生活必需品，自遠遠地祖先輩已經是這樣的艱苦的做着了，他們忠實於祖先的事實，從來沒有一點兒偸懶，更從來沒有違抝過日趨沒落的灰色的「命運」。有時他們在生活的重壓下感到窒息般的被什麼抓緊着，但他們確在合力勞作時的歡快中戰勝了這鬱集的苦悶了。</p>
<p>往常，在迷離而凉爽的晨霧中，或浴在黃昏的玫瑰色的晚霞裏，年靑而强壯的夫婦，孩子，老年人，他們都是在嗅着那肥沃而甜蜜的土壤的氣息，他們忙碌着，工作着，處處漾溢着嚮亮悅耳的簡短的民歌，像從來不曉得什麼是疲勞似的。他們是整個兒的陶醉在神聖的工作中了。</p>
<p>像火山的爆裂一樣，他們被遠遠的拋到了陌生的外鄉來了，於是已往的情景變成了美麗的夢幻，片斷的存留在紊亂多波的腦海而得不到完整。</p>
<p>現在，他們不光是失去了樂園，且失掉了自由，失掉一切……</p>
<p>他們是一羣奴隸，得不到一點同情，一切都是冰冷的陌生的，這外鄉的一切給他們似乎完全沒有關係，彷彿不歡迎這羣爲了自己的「命運」而遭難的客人似的；於是，他們就在腦海中盤旋着那個共同的疑問：「是誰呌我們這樣的呵？我們也是有過家的！……」。但這疑問從來沒有得到回答。</p>
<p>「你們這些混蛋，…草包！有點兒什麼用？嗯…」</p>
<p>所長每來巡一次就這樣的吼呌着，他不耐煩舞動着籐子桿兒，向人身上抽打着，但他總是因爲一隻手掩着鼻子的緣故，只匆忙的一會兒功夫他便離開這兒到外邊去才深深地換一口氣。</p>
<p>「媽那個巴子！也不……也不……活着有鷄巴用嗎？奶奶個……」</p>
<p>所長似乎爲這些草棚里的草包們氣傷了，每次，每次，他都要發着脾氣，如果是沒有這草棚的時候，他一定沒有那幅難看的面容的。</p>
<p>「喂，高梁又要沒有了，是不是……」會計員向所長說：「要是…不先還上一批錢，米店里就不再欠賬了！…」</p>
<p>「嚷什麼？用得着這麽大聲大氣的？媽那巴子的！這些廢物光會吃！每人一天只給兩小碗好了…奶奶，煮得生一點不是就出數了嗎？……」</p>
<p>「比彷說是炭呵，柴呵…什麼的也都要買點啦，別把錢……」</p>
<p>「唔…這個…這個我曉得…嘖！眞沒有辦法…眞……」</p>
<p>「聽說，…聽說上邊要派入來査啦，賬目，錢項，還有你那些……那，那可怎麽交代哪？……」會計員更緊了一步。</p>
<p>「………………」</p>
<p>老半天一后，所長把隻拳頭往手掌上呯的一拍，說：</p>
<p>「媽那巴子的，好了，這麽辦……」他走近了會計員把嘴凑在會計員的耳邊「…………是不是哪？嗯…」他拍着會計員的肩頭：「喂，老弟！這世界上還有什麽仁慈呵？嗯……有你一份兒！…」</p>
<p>所長笑了，會計員也笑了。</p>
<p>夜，降臨到這荒僻的野地上了，壙野里靜靜地躺着些殘頹的荒坵，沒有一點兒聲息，那一連大串的草棚已經在朦攏的夜色中顯得糢糊了！二百八十一個草包在寂寞的夢里呼出了幽鬱的調子，在夢里，也唯有在夢里，他們才回到了美的的故鄉，得到點不能兌現的安慰。</p>

<p>— 顧文宗作</p>
<p>麗雅　讓你那麼一解釋，我對於剛才那頓大菜，發生很大的疑問！假若那個廚子不是英國使館的廚子，那我豈不是上了當了嗎？</p>
<p>驚鴻　那也不算上當，反正你肚子吃飽了是眞的，其餘的部份，那是你心理上所需要的問題，因爲好吃大菜的人，往往都喜</p>
<p>麗雅　歡吃英法大菜，設若用英法大菜的名詞來應合一般吃主的心理，那在發業上必能收到生財的功效，至於飯車上的廚子是吾在英國使館做過廚子的，那你也不必去調査了，在實際上說你吃的是中國人做的大菜，不過在心理上說，你才分得出英國味兒的大菜或是中國味兒的大菜來呢，別的還有甚麼呢？你又何必對這件事感到掃與呢？反正你肚子吃飽了就得了。</p>
<p>麗雅　爲的是要吃十足英國味兒的大菜；才花那麼多錢去吃大菜，要不然；我不會吃蛋炒飯嗎？蛋炒飯也一樣會飽人的—眞是！我實在是個小市民羣裏的愚人！鄕下佬兒！阿木林！我氣死了！我眞是太老憨了！</p>
<p>驚鴻　你這時候兒爲甚麼要懊悔呢？你剛才是說過吃大菜的人，總茶吃大菜的人嗎？我想一個人吃的旣是所謂大菜，那個人的氣量，當然也要大的，所謂大人物，吃大菜，坐大車，看大戲，花大錢，說大話，而且氣量也要大，局面更要大，無往而不大是不是？</p>

<p>新華公司的攝影場裏搭着山峯的佈景，在徐家滙電車下來，遠望過去，就可以隱的看得出。這山峯脚下便是「桃源春夢」的桃源村，一塲非常吃重的戲，不但韓蘭根劉繼羣在這裏邊出足噱頭，童月娟許曼麗也都以希奇古怪的半裸裝束出現，因爲這「桃源村」似乎是在另外一個未開化的民族裏，那地方的男女老幼，身上披着的東西都是很少很薄，身臨其間，自有一種美感，這樣，在銀幕上確然是好玩極了，那知攝製道場戲時，就有橫在前面的種種難問題發生，譬如這場戲需要七十個年輕的姑娘，這七十個年輕的姑娘由戲務部去招米，確是不難，但如果要求這七十個年輕的姑娘脫去衣服，披上薄紗，那就不是容易的事了。新華公司在攝製「桃源春夢，這場戲之前，便顧慮到這一層，本來是打算要七十個姑娘的，特地託人去招了九十個來，預備有二十個姑娘聽了要脫去衣服而不幹，那知結果這九十個姑娘之中，竟有四十個表示不願意，都回去了，剩下五十個姑娘來完成這場別有風味的美感的場面。</p>

<p>亞爾喬生主演的歌舞鉅片「歌壇風月」The　Singing　Kid一片，已定於今日（星期五）起，在大光明公映。因爲亞爾喬生是華納公司的一位功臣，所以公司方面，對於他所主演的片子，資本也特別花得多，配角人村也特別重視。本片除亞爾喬生外，尙有一九三六年的新進女明星蓓芙莉露勃絲，小寶貝薜佩兒琪蓀，滑稽明星愛德華霍登和阿倫狄根氏等，分任劇中次要角色，更覺錦上添花。歌唱部份，更有名樂隊領袖凱爾卡羅惠和他的「熱樂隊」，及美國著名的遊艇俱樂部四大歌星加入合作。片中對白不多，全部空氣，激盪於迅疾在放的歌聲舞影之間，總之這部「歌壇風月」，可稱得一部至上消遣的音樂歌舞劇。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Bizarre News from the Southwest: Foreign Dispatches Unfounded, Guangdong Authorities Deny Military Actions, Central Government Does Not Change Consistent Policy, Troop Increases in Hunan and Jiangxi Entirely Untrue <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In recent days, foreign dispatches have spread various rumors about the Southwest. Our correspondent has made extensive inquiries to all relevant parties, who all believe that these rumors are completely groundless. They have also stated that internal pacification is the Central Government's consistent policy. While there may be different views on foreign policy steps in the Southwest, they would not take actions that would undermine national peace and unity. It is expected that these rumors will disprove themselves. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In recent days, the Japanese Domei News Agency has been spreading various bizarre reports about the situation in the Southwest. Our correspondent made a special visit to a high-ranking official of the Central Government on the 4th to inquire about the truth. The official said the following: In recent years, the Central Government's consistent policy has been to unite the country, resist foreign aggression, suppress the communist bandits, and revitalize the nation. This consistent policy will not be shaken by any party or situation. This is universally known and seen throughout the country. The Domei News Agency's claim that the Central Government is increasing troops on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi is completely unfounded. Since the communist bandits were routed from Jiangxi and fled to the northwest provinces last year, the Central Government has been gradually transferring the troops stationed in the south to the northwest to thoroughly suppress them. Not only has the Central Government not increased troops in the south, but it has already transferred all of them to the northwest. Therefore, the Domei News Agency's claim that the Central Government is increasing troops on the border between Hunan and Jiangxi is clearly not true. While the Central Government is working hard to suppress bandits in order to pacify the country internally and resist foreign aggression, the Domei News Agency is projecting its own intentions onto others. The Domei News Agency's claim that the Southwest is mobilizing is also unbelievable. As the national crisis becomes increasingly serious, no one would be so insane as to use diplomacy as a pretext for civil war, undermine the Central Government's consistent policy, and disrupt the rear areas of the military. If they were to truly engage in such behavior, they would surely be abandoned by the world and not tolerated by the people. In short, the Central Government will not change its established consistent policy. The entire country, from top to bottom, should be united and should not be misled by rumors, lest they disrupt the steps to save the country. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The claim that Southwest troops have occupied Yong County (Yongzhou) and Yizhang County in Hunan Province has been denied by the local authorities here. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) No one here has heard of the claim that Southwest troops occupied Yong County and Yizhang County in Hunan Province yesterday. (Reuters, 4th) The Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have firmly denied the claim that Southwest troops occupied Yong County (Yongzhou) and Yizhang, saying it is completely groundless. Foreign consuls here stated to a Reuters correspondent today that they had no knowledge of the reported announcement by the Guangdong and Guangxi military authorities that they had occupied Yong and Yi counties. The entire city is as peaceful as usual. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) 1,845 Cantonese dollars are now worth 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. Local bankers fear that the situation will worsen further. If the overall situation does not ease, the Cantonese dollar will inevitably continue to fall. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangxi military headquarters announced today that the Japanese report that Guangxi troops had invaded Hunan Province was entirely fabricated. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 3rd of this month, the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun published a strange news item, stating that the leaders of the Southwest, angered by the Central Government's oppression, had issued a declaration, planning to form an independent government and begin military actions. In order to prove the falsity of this rumor, our reporter made a special visit to a certain gentleman in the Ministry of Military Affairs to inquire about everything. He replied, saying that the Central Government had not received any telegram from the Southwest. At present, the majority of the Central Government's troops are stationed in the northwest and the border area between Sichuan and Yunnan, tasked with suppressing bandits. This is known to the generals of Guangdong and Guangxi and the people of the whole country. The so-called concentration of large forces in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guizhou must be someone sowing discord. As for the news of the formation of an independent government and the beginning of military actions, I believe that at this critical moment of national crisis, unless there are ulterior motives, hoping for the permanent division of our country and the mutual slaughter of domestic soldiers, no one would do such a thing. At present, all of us Chinese people should eliminate our private prejudices, unite in spirit, and jointly strive for the great cause of saving the nation and ensuring its survival. We must not reverse course and undermine national unity, thereby cutting ourselves off from the people. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang sent a telegram on the 3rd to initiate the establishment of the National Economic Reconstruction Movement Committee and issued the general regulations of the committee, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram (excerpt): In recent years, disasters have struck repeatedly, and the crisis of the national economy has become increasingly serious. If we do not make efforts to engage in reconstruction, we will not be able to save the nation and ensure its survival. In order to complete this task, people throughout the country must rise up and pursue it urgently, pooling their wisdom and efforts to promote it effectively. Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve rapid results. Therefore, implementing the National Economic Reconstruction Movement is the basic way for people throughout the country to devote themselves to national economic reconstruction. The items to be implemented in the movement were summarized and publicized to the people in a telegram sent by Zhongzheng to all provinces on August 9 of last year and in a broadcast speech on New Year's Day this year. It is not a high-sounding theory but rather easy to implement. Based on this spirit, I have specially formulated the general regulations of the National Economic Reconstruction Movement Committee, stipulating that general headquarters be established in Nanjing, with Zhongzheng as the chairman, and branches be established in the provinces and municipalities directly under the central government, and sub-branches be established in the counties, so that there is unified correspondence and cooperation between the central and local governments and the people, to unleash the nation's productive capacity and lay the foundation for national revival. The future of the nation will be brighter. In addition to setting up a preparatory committee for the general headquarters within the Ministry of Industry and designating Vice President Kong, Minister Wu, and Secretary-General Weng as preparatory committee members, with Minister Wu as the director of the preparatory committee, all branches and sub-branches should immediately have preparatory personnel appointed by the chairmen of the provincial governments, the mayors of the municipalities directly under the central government, and the administrative inspectors or county magistrates, and designate the directors of the provincial construction bureaus or equivalent personnel as the directors of the preparatory committees, in order to establish them simultaneously and quickly get to work. I have high hopes for this.</p>
<p>General Regulations: The purpose of this committee is to unite the central and local governments and the people in cooperation to assist the government, promote society, and develop economic reconstruction. The general headquarters of this committee shall be established in Nanjing, branches shall be established in the provinces and municipalities directly under the central government, and sub-branches shall be established in the counties. This committee shall handle the following matters: 1. Assisting in the implementation of central and local government economic reconstruction plans. 2. Promoting various social economic reconstruction endeavors. 3. Training and introducing various economic reconstruction talents. 4. Researching and developing the nation's agriculture, industry, sideline occupations, and special local products. 5. Promoting thrift and promoting domestic products. The above matters shall be implemented according to their nature, and the implementation rules shall be divided and cooperated by the general headquarters, branches, and sub-branches. The central administrative leader shall be the chairman of the general headquarters, and the members shall be appointed or hired by the chairman. The chairman of the provincial government or mayor shall be the chairman of the branches, and the members shall be appointed or hired by the chairman of the branches. The commissioner or county magistrate shall be the chairman of the sub-branches, and the members shall be appointed or hired by the chairman of the sub-branches. Members of the general headquarters may also serve as members of the branches and sub-branches. The expenses of the general headquarters shall be allocated by the central government, the expenses of the branches shall be allocated by the provincial and municipal governments, and the expenses of the sub-branches shall be allocated by the county governments. The various operating rules of the general headquarters, branches, and sub-branches shall be formulated or approved by the chairman of the general headquarters. When these general regulations are to be revised, the chairman of the general headquarters shall solicit the opinions of the members and implement them. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The bombing of the Beining railway tracks is under investigation by all parties, but there are no clues. Ishii told people on the 4th that the Japanese side's attitude towards this matter will be expressed after a clear investigation. Ishii also said that the Hebei-Chahar issue has not been formally discussed because Tashiro has just taken office. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ishii said that after Tashiro took office, there has not yet been any formal negotiation on North China diplomacy. Although Xiao and Chen have met repeatedly, they have only exchanged views. The bombing of the Beining Railway is still under investigation to ascertain the truth. However, the difficulty here is that the incident occurred at 8:20 AM, and the investigation train did not depart until 10:00 AM, a distance of two hours, making it difficult to find evidence. The Japanese military will decide on its attitude only after the full background of the case is clear. What has been obtained so far is only the facts of what transpired, and it is not yet time to issue a statement to the outside world. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zuobin told people that the General Office for the National Assembly Representative Election will be established this month. The candidates for deputy director will be announced within days. There are no vacant buildings in the National Government that are suitable for the General Office, so appropriate buildings will be selected separately for use. The candidates for general supervisors and district supervisors of the elections in the provinces and cities are expected to be announced as soon as the General Office is established, and the election offices will be established at the same time to carry out preparations. Regarding the election date, it is currently under discussion and has been decided to hold elections simultaneously at home and abroad within January to prevent abuses. As for the specific procedures for the election, the preparatory committee is discussing it. (Special Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The preparatory committee for the National Assembly Representative Election is scheduled to hold its third preparatory meeting within the National Government on the 6th to review the detailed rules for the implementation of the election law and the expenses of the General Office. According to a person in charge of the committee, the Deputy Director and Deputy Chief Secretary will be announced in days. The General Office for election can be established within this month. The General Supervisors of the elections in each province and district election supervisors may also be appointed before the establishment of the General Office. Regarding the issue of the election date, in principle, if elections can be held at home and abroad on the same day, various abuses can be avoided. However, China has a vast territory, and transportation is obstructed, so there are still many difficulties that need to be discussed in detail before a decision can be made. This decision concerns the National Assembly, which is of great importance, and the preparatory staff will proceed with caution. On the side of the citizens, they should also exercise their right to vote properly and select talents for the country, so as not to fail the expectations of the country. Chen Shuren also said that regarding the election of overseas Chinese representatives to the National Assembly, although the election law stipulates that he shall be the general supervisor of elections, all measures shall still be handled in accordance with the General Office, and the types and numbers of overseas Chinese organizations in various places are being reviewed for submission to the General Office.

<h3 id="e12">Japan's Southern Advance <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>At this time of rapid turmoil in North China, Japan's expansion southward is becoming increasingly active. According to a China United Press dispatch from the 2nd of this month, the Japanese government, in order to intensify the implementation of its southern advance policy, has decided to begin extensive activities immediately. The specific measures include establishing a South Seas Section within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs system, and then combining the Navy's South Seas Section, as well as directly related agencies of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, and the Taiwan and South Seas Colonial Associations, the South Seas Compensation Issuance Company, the Siam Association, the Philippines Association, and the South Seas Research Association. Private companies and organizations will organize large-scale committees to engage in research and promotion. From this, we can see how urgent Japan's southward expansion has become.</p>
<p>Japan's southern advance policy has always been complementary to its continental policy. The implementation of the continental policy requires the guarantee of a strong navy in the ocean. Maintaining a strong navy has become an important factor in Japan's southward expansion. In the progress of the continental policy, the navy was only in a passively auxiliary position. This was naturally not satisfactory to the naval authorities. They believed that a strong navy should not only be an appendage of the army, but should adopt an independent strategy. Therefore, the naval authorities have been vigorously promoting that southward expansion not only meets the needs of national defense and strategy, but is also a shortcut to solving economic difficulties. They believe that only if Japan controls the South Seas can it obtain a sufficient supply of food and raw materials and a vast market.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Guangxi cabinet, Navy Minister Nagano immediately requested that the naval budget be increased by 550 million yuan to strengthen the navy's strength to carry out the southern advance policy. Recently, after several cabinet meetings, it was decided on the so-called "New Southern Policy," with Taiwan as a base to vigorously expand in all aspects of the South Pacific. (The key points of this policy are: (1) Placing economic importance on Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan. (2) Opening air routes between South Seas trustee territory and Taiwan. (3) Establishing the Taiwan Colonial Company. (4) Establishing the South Seas Colonial Company.)</p>
<p>The first step of Japan's southern advance policy is, of course, to seek political and economic control of South China. We can see concrete proof of this in the recent activity of the so-called "autonomy movement" in Fujian, the completion of the Taipei airfield, the establishment of Japanese cultural centers in various counties of southern Fujian, and the frequent visits of Japanese survey groups. Secondly, Siam, Borneo, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies are all key targets of its southern advance. Especially in Siam, its activities have been particularly active recently, such as encouraging the Siamese government to excavate the Kra Canal and sending many experts to be advisors to the Siamese government. According to reports a few days ago, Siam sent many naval students to study in Japan, which is a clear indication of Japanese-Siamese contact.</p>
<p>However, Japan's continued southward advance will undoubtedly lead to a serious conflict with Great Britain. Britain can tolerate Japan's expansion in North China, but it cannot make any more concessions to its threat to the south. For example, Japan's plan to excavate a canal in the Kra Isthmus will not be allowed by Britain, because once this canal is open, Singapore, which has always been called the "Gibraltar of the East," will become a dead port. Recently, Britain has been making every effort to fortify Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places, with the aim of preventing Japan.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's southern advance policy is advancing in parallel with its continental policy. At this time of tense situation in North China, its expansion southward is becoming increasingly active. We must pay attention to the current situation in North China, but we must also not ignore the crisis in our south.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Smuggling Scandal in North China: Britain Invited the US, Germany, and France to Jointly Protest to Japan, the US Agreed, France Refused, Germany Has Not Replied, British Parliament Unanimously Supports the Government <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(London) Reuters learned today that Britain's policy, given that smuggling in North China has caused unprecedented losses to Chinese finances and foreign trade, has requested the US, Germany, and France to coordinate with Britain to protest to Japan. The United States readily agreed, Germany has not yet replied, presumably because it recently concluded a commercial agreement with "Manchukuo." France has refused, and it is believed that this is because France is currently busy with other matters elsewhere and cannot attend to side issues, and because French commercial interests in North China are relatively small. It is said that British Foreign Secretary Eden does not want to relax his efforts to persuade Japan to help curb smuggling. It is now learned that when Parliament reconvenes, several questions will be raised on this issue. Members of the House of Commons say that they fully understand the Foreign Secretary's intention to use various methods to stop smuggling. Their questions are only intended to express that the Foreign Secretary's urging of Japan to take an appropriate view of what they see as an "intolerable scandal" has the full support of Parliament.

<p>(Tokyo) Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on his way to China, spent three days in Osaka, attending a discussion meeting with Osaka traders to exchange views on special trade in North China. Representatives of the traders expressed their views, saying that special trade in North China seems likely to become legitimate trade in the future. This special trade occurred because China excessively increased tariffs, and it cannot be prevented from continuing without taking appropriate measures. Director Kuwashima also said that Japan's diplomatic policy has now changed to be autonomous and fundamentally different from the diplomacy of other countries. Trade in North China has now reached a state of saturation, and it is not known whether it will gradually shrink in the future. The authorities are now considering negotiating with China to reduce tariffs as a way to try to change the current situation. Director Kuwashima's remarks have attracted much attention.

<p>(Tokyo) The Army, Navy, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Colonial Affairs have been considering setting up an organization to develop overseas fuel resources. Now, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and other companies are willing to jointly invest 5 million yuan as capital to establish the national policy of fuel. The company will be named Kyowa Mining Co., Ltd. A founding general meeting was held on the 1st of this month to decide on various clauses. When the company officially starts its business in the future, it will need at least 10 million yuan in capital. Currently, it plans to temporarily develop oil fields in the South Seas, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. Therefore, Borneo Oil Co., Ltd. (capitalized at 1.5 million yuan), which is jointly funded by Mitsui &amp; Co. and Japan Oil Co., will also be merged into the newly established company recently. The technical aspects and trial operations will be assisted by Japan Oil Co. to the best of its ability. Hashimoto Keizaburo, director of Japan Oil Co., said he will be appointed as an advisor to the company. (Domei News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The special parliament has already closed. As the first step in the Hirota Cabinet's active industrial policy, Commerce and Industry Minister Ogawa said at this parliament that the two major national policies of steelmaking and fuel are aiming for a general parliament and attempting to establish it. Therefore, he ordered the relevant authorities to prepare as soon as possible the necessary investigation and research. However, on steelmaking, a general collection of basic investigation materials has gradually been gathered this time. Therefore, on the 5th, a steelmaking-related inter-provincial conference will be held within the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to discuss concrete plans. However, this is the first stage of establishing a national policy of steelmaking for national defense purposes, so its main focus is on production, establishing self-sufficiency in pig iron and steel. In peacetime, it relies on imports from China, the South Seas, and India, and in times of emergency, measures will be taken to install weak mines domestically and mainly develop the Maosan mine in Korea, and discuss resource development strategies in South Manchuria Railway.

<p>(Nanjing) Finance Minister Kong telegraphed to the authorities of all provinces and cities on the 4th, requesting assistance in anti-smuggling. The original telegram stated, "The government has previously promulgated measures to prevent smuggling by land transport, as well as implementing detailed rules, provisional regulations for punishing tax evasion, temporary regulations for inspecting the transportation and sale of imported goods, and the Ministry has stipulated generous reward measures and established tip-off boxes. These have all been reported successively and are now being earnestly implemented according to the aforementioned regulations. However, this matter is of great importance. The loss to the national treasury is significant, and legitimate merchants suffer greatly, affecting the market and causing pain. Currently, smuggled goods may flood the inland areas, relying on the full assistance of local military and police. I hereby telegraph to request you to instruct your subordinates to comply with and implement this, and I will be most grateful." (4th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has added seven items to the reward measures for tip-offs, stipulating that tip-off boxes should be set up in customs and branch customs locations, allowing general merchants and civilians to submit documents to report smuggling, sale of smuggled goods, and concealment of smuggled goods. A circular telegram has been sent to all provincial and municipal governments to announce this to the public. (4th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Based on the provisions of the Temporary Regulations for Inspecting the Transportation and Sale of Imported Goods, the Ministry of Finance has appropriately stipulated the types of goods to be inspected, the various ash slurry buckets, the styles of the two types of licenses for transportation and sale, and the registration and licensing methods for merchants, factories, and transshipment companies.

(2) All wholesalers, purchasers, or transshipment companies, etc., shall prepare a license application form within 20 days from the date of promulgation of these methods in the local area and register with the agency designated by the Ministry of Finance to obtain a license. (3) When merchants and transshipment companies prepare a license application form, they shall also obtain a certificate from the local trade association. If there is no local trade association, they shall obtain a certificate from the local chamber of commerce.

<h3 id="e22">Ma Yinchu Speaks on Methods to Prevent Smuggling <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu spoke on the best methods to prevent smuggling at the Central Broadcasting Station on the 3rd. He first said that after the European War, we gained two major points: one was that justice triumphs over might, and the other was that those with insufficient resources cannot achieve final victory. After Italy annexed Abyssinia, these two major principles that were roughly established after the war were overturned. Examining Italy's methods of overturning, it was through controlled economy, tightly organizing groups on one hand and increasing production efficiency on the other. Therefore, it is known that even organized impoverished countries can achieve final victory. Secondly, he said that China's poverty is not true poverty, because there are many resources hidden underground that have not yet been developed. Italy, on the other hand, has very few natural resources, making it truly poor. Yet, it can achieve great results with a controlled economy. China can even implement a controlled economy, tightly organize, and develop rich resources, and its effectiveness will certainly be above Italy. Moreover, Italy controls for offense, while we control for defense. The difficulty is vastly different, which is obvious. It is only that the Chinese people should have self-confidence. China's method of controlled economy is different from that of foreign countries. Foreign countries emphasize external control, while China emphasizes internal control. The scope does not have to be very broad, and it can be done by starting with the following matters: (1) control of transportation, (2) control of currency, and (3) control of industrial and commercial groups. The first two items have made progress through the efforts of the government, but special attention should be paid to the third item. To control industrial and commercial groups, it is necessary to start with organization, making them strong and powerful, and strengthening the powers of existing guilds and chambers of commerce. Because the original Guild Law stipulated the adoption of a laissez-faire policy, it should now be changed to an interventionist policy. All industries must join the guild, and the guild must join the chamber of commerce. If this can be done, not only can the current smuggling problem be solved, but other problems can also be easily solved. Today's smuggling not only destroys the national tax system but also shakes the foundation of the national economy. If it continues to be rampant, it would be too laissez-faire and too free. Intervention and control can maintain the overall interests, so there is a need for intervention and control. Ma did not call the guild a horizontal organization, and the chamber of commerce is a vertical organization. It goes without saying that they have a close relationship. Moreover, industries should help each other and communicate with each other. For example, banks should not lend money to those who handle smuggled goods, transshipment companies should not transport smuggled goods, and porters should not unload smuggled goods. These are all examples. Since industries have helped each other, the public and private sectors should cooperate even more. Unscrupulous merchants will not be able to stand, and will not the smuggling problem be solved from then on? (4th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japan, based on the initiation of the Australian Trade Protection Act, restricts the amount of Australian wool purchased. It is reported that the Chairman of the Wool Industry Association, Kawanishi, recently visited relevant cabinet members, and as a result of the agreement, the opinions of government and civilians were unanimously decided as follows:</p>
<p>The amount of wool purchased from Australia is limited to one-third of the previous amount, that is, 250,000 bales.</p>
<p>Purchase 250,000 bales of wool from South America and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Because there is still a shortage of 250,000 bales, the wool industry is implementing a 30% reduction in work.</p>
<p>The government's decision does not clarify the quantity restriction, so the above quantities only represent its limits. However, it is noteworthy that wool industrialists have abandoned their previous attitude and are determined to implement major restrictions. (4th Associated Press)</p>

<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister and current Mayor of Lyon Herriot was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives today, receiving 377 votes. Another right-wing member of parliament received 150 votes. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The franc suffered setbacks again today, its price falling to 76.48. After the British Equalization Fund provided significant assistance, it returned to 76.44. All parties are now asking each other, "Has the gold group reached the end of its rope?" The number of individuals selling small amounts increased sharply today, exceeding the number of large sales, indicating that public panic has gradually become widespread.</p>
<p>Those with informed sources in the foreign exchange market now feel that the new Premier Blum is facing an increasingly difficult situation due to the labor unrest. Political undercurrents lurk in the labor unrest, which is gradually becoming clear. The general opinion is that the new government will not want to attempt to lower the value of the currency in this turbulent atmosphere, so as not to fall into a political storm and be unable to extricate itself. It will probably implement some kind of exchange restriction as a temporary measure.</p>
<p>The French Treasury is now gradually reaching its borrowing limit, so it is probably unavoidable that it will directly rely on the Bank of France. If so, then it will be necessary to select someone with similar opinions to the "Popular Front" to replace the current president of the Bank of France. This kind of atmosphere is making the public's panic even more intense.</p>
<p>British industry is quite concerned that the current high exchange rate of the pound against various gold coins will weaken Britain's import trade position. The strength of the pound has caused the price of gold to continue to fall to 138 shillings and 3.5 pence. However, it is worth noting that when the price of the franc was 76.50 in 1934, the price of gold only reached 137 shillings and 2 pence, which reflects the current increase in demand for hoarding.</p>
<p>According to a report released by the Bank of England today, the number of British pound banknotes purchased by the European continent for hoarding is enormous. The number of British pound banknotes in circulation has increased by £7,000,000, reaching a total of £433,000,000, which is a new record. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, the Bank of France released a report today stating that it lost gold worth 437,000,000 francs in the week ending May 29. Gold reserves have fallen from 62.37 to 61.01. (4th Reuters)</p>

<p>(Paris) Negotiations between metal industry employers and striking workers have broken down. They have now written to the new Premier Blum, saying that the situation is serious and unprecedented, approaching a revolutionary nature, and the government should be responsible for resolving it. The strike wave shows no signs of weakening. Three thousand munitions workers in Valenciennes, who are currently manufacturing heavy artillery shells and cannons, also joined the strike today. Thousands of miners in Anzin also stopped work, occupying the mine shafts and demanding wage increases. There are now fears that the strike will extend to the press, as the strikers at the Hachette building, which distributes newspapers, have set up pickets, and the lack of paper for printing newspapers has been greatly reduced due to the strike of transport carters. There is also a risk of strikes on public buses and underground trains. Many gasoline sales outlets have already closed. Bakers are also demanding wage increases and are likely to strike as well. It is now expected that the new Premier Blum will promulgate laws to curb the labor unrest and implement a 40-hour work week. Blum hopes to formulate the administrative outline of the "Popular Front" within two months, and the various departments will implement its details. The strike of transport carters has made it impossible to distribute the "L'Intransigeant" after it is printed. It is estimated that other newspapers will also be affected by the strike soon. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike wave is expanding further today. Newspapers are unable to be distributed because the distributors are all on strike. Cars on the streets have also been greatly reduced due to the strike of gasoline distributors. The number of strikers has now reached 400,000, accounting for more than 360 factories. (4th National Gazette)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French strike wave has a tendency to spread across the country and there are fears that a general strike will occur nationwide on the occasion of the establishment of the new left-wing cabinet. According to today's estimates, at least 250,000 workers in various industries are on strike. The American-owned Hotchkiss factory has 11,000 strikers. Most of the gas plants in Paris have been closed. Civil servants are also planning to join the strike tomorrow. Although there are many rumors, the People's Front issued a statement today acknowledging the loss of the general strike reported by foreigners. (3rd National Gazette)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike movement of staying in the factory without working has now spread to the steel mills of Terne and Anzin. 3,700 workers threatened that if the employers could not satisfy them, they would shut down the furnaces. Agricultural workers in the area near Paris are also now on strike. Workers in the gas, electricity, railway, and public transportation industries have all threatened to join the strike today. According to trade union claims, 230 factories in one area of Paris have been shut down, greatly affecting food and other supplies. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The ice factory strikers have resumed work because the employers have accepted their demands, so the main panic about the city's food supply has been removed. But as one wave subsides, another rises. The employees of major oil companies have also gone on strike, staying in the company and not working. If a solution is not found quickly, oil reserves will be exhausted within a few days, and public and private transportation may be disrupted. The new government took office today. Interior Minister Salengro issued a warning, saying that the new government cannot tolerate illegal activities by workers, and those occupying factories should leave quickly. The total number of strikers is still estimated to be over 250,000. (4th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The strike wave has now expanded and is sufficient to produce various economic consequences, so the current situation is quite serious. In total, there are as many as 100,000 strikers in the capital area, and 250,000 in various parts of the country. Those who joined the strike in the capital today include Hachette Newspaper Distribution Company, Coty Perfume Factory, Pathé-Nathan United Film Company, etc. Among them, Hachette Company is the only company in the country that operates the newspaper distribution business. It is estimated that a compromise between labor and management can be reached tonight to end the labor unrest. The bakery workers are scheduled to meet tonight, and the chemical industry union is scheduled to meet tomorrow morning in order to decide the attitude of each industry towards the labor unrest. At the same time, water tower workers have also joined the strike. Newspaper stacks are occupied by workers, and ink factories have stopped working, so there is a risk that there will be no water to drink and no newspapers to read in Paris. In the government and trade union sectors, every effort should be made to preserve various public utilities, especially water, gas, and electricity, so that they can continue to work as usual. As for the provinces, textile workers in the northern provinces and dock workers in Marseilles, workers in automobile factories in Toulouse have all joined the strike. The demands are the same as those in the capital area, namely, increasing wages and allowing trade unions to represent workers in signing labor contracts with employers. So far, fortunately, there have been no disturbances in any part of the country. The current cabinet and future cabinet ministers, as well as trade union leaders, are paying close attention to the strike situation. In particular, the trade unions are eager to control the strike and prevent it from going off the rails. The future Minister of Interior and current Mayor of Lille Salengro recently gave a speech at a meeting of deputies from the left-wing People's Front, saying that the current strike situation is intolerable to the authorities, and it is hoped that the Communist Party and various trade unions will cooperate in mediation so that the strike can be ended quickly. He also said, "Whether trade union leaders can control the masses is an important issue that we should understand. Our responsibility is to guide the workers and control the labor movement, so that after the People's Front wins the election, anarchy does not arise. The victory of the People's Front is to guarantee peace and maintain order in the future cabinet. After the future cabinet comes to power, it should submit a bill to the House of Representatives, so that the working class can be patient for a moment and wait and see." After Salengro finished speaking, a Communist Party member replied that national order had not been disturbed, and that in order to resolve the strike, the 40-hour work week system should be implemented immediately. The trade union leaders also met in the evening of the same day to discuss what measures should be taken to control the labor movement. The current Prime Minister Sarraut and Interior Minister Frossard recently declared to the press that the representatives of labor and management are expected to reach an agreement tomorrow, so that the trade unions can quickly sign labor contracts with employers. (3rd Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The total number of strikers in the suburbs has now increased to more than 350,000. The strike wave is spreading rapidly, like a prairie fire, causing anxiety to the current government and the orthodox socialists who are about to take power. Even the trade unions are feeling at a loss. From this, it can be seen that this strike was not initiated by the trade unions. It was actually caused by the workers themselves, who have been suffering for a long time, taking the opportunity to launch it on their own. The United General Confederation of Labor and the Paris Federation of Trade Unions recently jointly issued a declaration, requesting that the striking workers should continue to supply milk and other major foods to the elderly, young, and sick as usual. In addition, according to reports from various sources, although this strike wave has lasted for a week, the striking workers have been able to strictly maintain discipline, and it is unlikely to degenerate into a general strike, and there is no other political effect. This is because trade union leaders have repeatedly stated that once the employers accept the workers' demands, the workers will resume work. (4th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The metallurgical factory owners recently notified Prime Minister Sarraut and Labor Minister Frossard that if the striking workers do not leave the factories immediately, it will be inconvenient to negotiate with their representatives. As for local security, they should ask the government to maintain it. (4th Havas)</p>

<p>Jerusalem - Although Palestine currently has five battalions of British troops stationed there, and the authorities have promulgated new emergency regulations, the state of terror throughout the territory has not subsided in the slightest. Two bridges on the Hebron road were blown up this morning at dawn. Due to the damage to the road, only very light vehicles can now pass through. In addition, approximately one mile of telephone lines was also destroyed. Last night, while British patrol police were patrolling the narrow streets of the old city, they were shot at, but fortunately no one was hit. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem - The situation in Palestine remains serious. The situation in Jaffa is relatively calm, but still tense. An Arab man who murdered a Jewish woman has been sentenced by the court to fifteen years of imprisonment. However, Arab nationalist conspirators and agitators have not ceased their activities. Fortunately, their power is not enough to command the masses. For example, the Arab workers at a British-owned cigarette factory are still working as usual, and Arab customers are still seen in Jewish-owned banks and department stores. As for the Tel Aviv city market, since its opening, due to the tense situation and unsafe transportation, the number of visitors has not been as large as in previous years. It is now scheduled to open on the 6th of this month. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The foreign affairs director of the National Socialist Party, Rosenberg (i.e., the advocate of neo-paganism), recently published an article in the party's official newspaper, the "People's Observer," commenting on the situation in British Mandate Palestine. He stated: "In Palestine, the rights of the Arab people have been trampled upon. If Britain can adopt a policy of appeasement towards this people, the impact will extend to the entire Muslim world, which can be kept obedient and free from trouble. This policy not only conforms to the former British Foreign Secretary Lord Balfour's declaration (Note: Balfour issued a declaration on November 2, 1917, guaranteeing the Zionist movement's activities in Palestine, but also stated that the sovereignty of non-Jewish peoples should not be harmed), but also allows the Jews in Palestine to migrate to border areas and let them live in their original settlements, so as not to cause conflict with the Arab people."

<p>(London) The King of Abyssinia held a meeting with journalists in the main living room of the country's embassy this morning, but did not speak. Instead, the embassy secretary read a written statement, which stated in part: "My country never had any intention of war. It was only when a strong enemy invaded our territory that we rose up to resist. Our people's armaments were inferior and unprepared, but they still resisted for seven months. In the end, we failed because the enemy army used poison gas, causing our soldiers and civilians to suffer terrible poisoning and burns, which we could not defend against. After much deliberation, I could only see two paths: one was to allow the enemy army to annihilate our entire nation, and the other was to go abroad myself and appeal to all countries, asking them to uphold justice. The League of Nations Covenant is the product of the painful sacrifices of the World War. If we allow it to be destroyed and remain silent, it is tantamount to allowing all of humanity to submit to might." After the secretary finished reading, the Albanian King bowed to the journalists and withdrew. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The Albanian King arrived at Waterloo Station today with his two sons, two daughters, and General Gaza. There was a large welcome, with rows of people shoulder to shoulder, some twenty deep. They took off their hats and cheered. Foreign Secretary Eden sent a private secretary to officially welcome him, which is the customary practice when a foreign monarch is traveling incognito in England. Among the dignitaries gathered at the station were the treasurer and chairman of the former Independent Labour Party, Lord Airlie, the economic reporter Sir Layton, the famous writer and speaker Sir Angell, and many Albanian expatriates, all of whom were wearing Albanian-style garments over European clothing. The Albanian King's two sons were dressed in dark blue clothes with floral designs, and his two daughters were wearing the most fashionable European clothes. General Gaza was wearing white Albanian clothes. The waiting crowd waved Albanian flags, which were distributed by an English woman, and read out several welcoming speeches. One was issued by the Indian representative to London. After the speeches, the King and his entourage entered cars, and the cheers resumed. The Albanian King raised his hat in thanks. A police escort led the way in front of the cars, heading straight to the magnificent residence of the wealthy merchant and philanthropist Sir Khadouri, who is currently in Shanghai. He telegraphed the Albanian King, offering his house as a place for the King to stay in London, which the Albanian King accepted. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) When the King of Abyssinia arrived here today, he was welcomed by tens of thousands of people. The situation was extremely enthusiastic. British public opinion clearly shows sympathy for Abyssinia. Political figures therefore predict that relations between Britain and Italy will become strained again. It is said that if the Albanian King resolutely decides to attend the League of Nations meeting in Geneva in person, Italy may withdraw from the alliance, and Britain can still negotiate with Italy separately outside the scope of the League of Nations. However, the British government will eventually advise the Albanian King not to make this trip. Foreign Secretary Eden met with the Italian Ambassador Grandi today. The conversation was not affected by the Albanian King's arrival. However, the discussion was still broad and vague, and there was no progress in the rapprochement between Britain and Italy. This is because Italy is unwilling to show a spirit of compromise to the League of Nations, and this determination remains unchanged. Britain, on the other hand, believes that the Italo-Ethiopian issue should first be resolved within the framework of the League of Nations, and only then can a way be found to adjust relations between Britain and Italy. Generally speaking, the British government is still willing to approach Italy. Experts at the Foreign Office are now seeking a solution that would achieve a win-win situation between Italy and the League of Nations, that is, to enable Italy to rejoin the collective security system while the League of Nations is not forced to recognize Italy's established fact of annexing Abyssinia. Once this plan is formulated, a compromise between Britain and Italy may be possible. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) In order to respond to Argentina's request to convene an extraordinary session of the General Assembly urgently to consider the issue of sanctions against Italy, the League of Nations plans to advance the date of the General Assembly in September and convene it within four weeks, probably on June 29. The League of Nations Executive Council was originally scheduled to meet on June 16 to discuss the sanctions issue, but due to this development, it has now been postponed to the end of June. In addition, the meeting of the signatory countries of the Dardanelles Strait Convention, which was originally scheduled to be convened in Montreux in the near future, has also been postponed to July. Argentina and other Latin American countries are now making every effort to oppose the lifting of sanctions against Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

At that time, British Foreign Secretary Eden (the chairman of the current Executive Council) will serve as interim chairman until a new chairman is elected. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Capital of Argentina - Regarding Argentina's request to convene the League of Nations General Assembly in advance, well-informed sources here have declared that Argentina's request was not instigated by any foreign country, but was entirely voluntary and supported by domestic public opinion.

<p>(Rome) The Argentine Ambassador visited Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich today to explain the Argentine government's proposal to the League of Nations. Suvich stated that Italy is currently opposed to Argentina's proposal to convene an extraordinary session of the League of Nations General Assembly to consider the issue of sanctions against Italy, and said that the responsibility of the League of Nations General Assembly is to formulate general principles, and what is needed now is to formulate practical proposals to seek compromise. In addition to requesting the General Assembly to consider the issue of sanctions, Argentina also requested that the situation caused by the annexation of Abyssinia and the reform of the League of Nations should be considered. Yesterday, the Argentine government sent a telegram to the League of Nations, proposing that the League of Nations General Assembly should convene a meeting around June 16. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the British government is quite favorable to Argentina's proposal to convene the League of Nations General Assembly in advance, but believes that it would be too early for the General Assembly to convene as early as the 15th of this month. Before the General Assembly convenes, diplomatic talks should first be held between the countries concerned to prepare, and the meeting of the Executive Council should make arrangements in advance so that the agenda can be completely arranged, and the representatives of the countries can bring clear instructions with them when they attend the General Assembly, without having to ask their governments for instructions at every turn. It is reported that the British government advocates that the General Assembly should convene on the 29th of this month. When Foreign Secretary Eden met with French Ambassador Corbin and South African High Commissioner de Villiers this afternoon, the date issue was discussed. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently published a letter from its former editor, Stead, stating that if the current sanctions are lifted, it will entail great danger and must be treated with caution. He also said, "As far as the British Empire is concerned, if it is willing to accept the humiliation of defeat, there may be a risk of disintegration within the empire. To avoid this, before changing the strategy adopted by the League of Nations (referring to sanctions), some decisions must be made in advance. What are the decisions? First, all countries should refuse to recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. Second, Italy needs money to develop Abyssinia, and all member states of the League of Nations should refuse to provide loans. Third, in the future, if there is any further act of aggression, all financial, economic, and military resources should be used to deal with the aggressor. There are many different opinions on whether to maintain or abolish sanctions, and the arguments are different. However, in any case, a fair assessment of this argument can only be made after the above three conditions have been met. Otherwise, abandoning sanctions is tantamount to abandoning the policy of collective security, which must be treated with caution." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) State Department officials stated today that although the Italo-Ethiopian War has ended, President Roosevelt had previously warned the American people not to travel on Italian or Ethiopian ships.

<p>— Zhou Qixun</p>
<p>Finally, there is sentence pattern imitation. Once ear training has yielded substantial results and oral imitation has a solid foundation, teachers can have students read English and imitate sentence construction. Junior and senior high school students have a great capacity for imitating sentences and should be encouraged to do so as much as possible. For example, if students already understand "I am Mr. Wong here yesterday," the teacher can have them replace "I" with words like "you," "we," and "they." Similarly, "saw" can be replaced with words like "met," "noticed," or "spoke to." Another example is transforming "I write the letter" into forms like "I write letters," "The letter is written," "I have the letter written," or "He has two letters written." This type of imitation enables students to actively use grammar, extrapolate, and practice repeatedly, which is extremely beneficial. Teachers should use this method frequently. This is the third method. If English is taught or learned using the above three methods, there is no reason for it not to be successful.</p>
<p>English Pronunciation</p>
<p>Among the three languages—English, German, and French—English pronunciation is the most difficult. Each English letter represents a wide variety of sounds within a word. If each letter consistently represented the same sound, pronunciation would be much easier, as is the case with German. The difficulty of English pronunciation lies here. Let's illustrate with some examples:</p>
<p>First—same letter, different sounds, for example:</p>
<p>Cat get exact man bin woman show</p>
<p>City gem estra human bind women cow</p>
<p>(and so on)</p>
<p>Second—same sound, different letters, for example:</p>
<p>Cat sit such bed win lies shows head light</p>
<p>Kitten City hutch said women buys go</p>
<p>(and so on)</p>
<p>Third—letter present but no sound, for example:</p>
<p>Knot graw fatique sign bough couldguard buy write awry right han Fkerchief psalm Programme and so on.</p>
<p>Fourth—different spelling but identical pronunciation, for example:</p>
<p>gnaw flower mourn caulk nose mode sewdd thyme hosrse nor; flour; morn; cork; knows; mowed; sowed; time; horse and so on.</p>
<p>From the examples above, we can see that English pronunciation is very irregular. We cannot pronounce a word based solely on its spelling. To compensate for this deficiency, the International Phonetic Alphabet is now widely used. The International Phonetic Alphabet is a system of phonetic symbols established by the International Phonetic Association. Currently, there are forty-six symbols. Each symbol represents a particular sound in English. Whenever that sound appears in an English word, it is represented by that symbol. The pronunciation of each symbol is constant. Therefore, by learning these symbols, we know how to pronounce words. There are two words in English whose pronunciation we often overlook: "of" and "off." These two words have different pronunciations: "of" is pronounced "ov," and "off" is pronounced "of." So, in the ordinary spelling of "of" and "off," we cannot see the difference in pronunciation, but if we consult An English Pronouncing Dictionarysc edited by Daniel Jneo, we will know how to pronounce them. Now, isn't it common for our newspapers to translate the British place names Birmingham, Buckingham, Cunningham, etc. as "Bo Ming Han"? This is incorrect. The reason for the mistranslation is that the translators saw "ham" at the end of the spelling of Birmingham, so they translated "ham" as "Han." Little did they know that the "h" in this word is silent. Therefore, it is clear that relying on spelling for pronunciation is not entirely reliable. Similarly, the English place names Worcester and Leicester are pronounced "wuso" and "lests," but if we are not careful or do not consult Daniel Jones's An English Pronouncing Dictionary, we will often make mistakes. Therefore, the International Phonetic Alphabet is very helpful for pronunciation. Furthermore, the word "the" is sometimes pronounced I (emphatir Jorm or before a vowel) and sometimes （before a consonant）. The letter "A" is sometimes pronounced "ei" (emphatic) and sometimes （unemphatic）. Students should pay attention to these distinctions. Currently, most English textbooks for senior high school students include International Phonetic Alphabet pronunciations for new words in each lesson, which is an improvement compared to the past, but they are still not fully utilized. The editors include them in the textbooks merely as a formality. So, when there are specific pronunciation issues that should be noted, they are not indicated with the International Phonetic Alphabet. We hope that teachers and students in junior and senior high schools will make greater use of the International Phonetic Alphabet. (End)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The strike by Kailuan Tangshan coal miners demanding continuous shifts has not yet been resolved. The puppet Eastern Hebei government dispatched Councilor Wang Xiacai on the 3rd to mediate. Workers are brewing a slowdown strike. Security is tight in the mining area. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council believes that the absence of Kailuan Mining Bureau Manager Gu Zhenjiu is delaying mining affairs. It has tentatively appointed Yuan Jialao as manager. The British board of directors of Kailuan has telegraphed the London board of directors for instructions. The mining bureau has no prejudice against the change of manager, but hopes that the Hebei-Chahar Political Council understands that the Chinese manager's position in the mining bureau represents the Ministry of Industries as a supervisor for Chinese shareholders, separate from the position of the British board of directors. If Yuan can comply with this principle, his appointment will not be rejected. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

A member of the Associated Press spoke with Vice President Espinoza, who said that the President is ready to hand over power, but General Somoza insists that he must remain in office until January 1 next year. The President and other government officials are still surrounded in the palace, but those surrounding them are no longer hostile, and it is likely to be resolved soon. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Large Quantity of Smuggled Sugar Confiscated in Jinan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The transporter forcibly demanded loading and unloading with an overbearing attitude. Li Tonghua argued on principle, resulting in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Recently, smuggled goods such as cigarettes, paper, and white sugar have been continuously arriving from Tianjin. Therefore, the central government specially established customs anti-smuggling offices along the Jinpu Railway at Xuzhou, Jinan, Dezhou, and other stations. On the 31st of last month, train No. 305 on the Pingpu line carried 50 tons of smuggled white sugar. On the 1st of this month, another 160 tons of smuggled white sugar were transported on train No. 305. All of these goods were transferred from the Beining Railway with connecting tickets. Li Tonghua, the deputy director of the Jinan Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office, ordered that all of them be detained in the rail yard, and the original train remained unmoved. At about 9:00 AM on the 2nd, about 50 people, some of whom were foreigners, arrived at the station. They first asked Li Tonghua for the white sugar that had been transported. Li, due to his duty, could not allow them to take it away. However, the other party insisted on loading and unloading. Seeing their unreasonable demands, Li immediately notified the consular office in Jinan by telephone. The consular office sent two people to the station. Li stated that he was ordered to inspect smuggled goods in Jinan. How could he allow them to evade customs duties? If they insisted on taking the goods away, the transporter had to submit the Tianjin Customs delivery documents before they could be released. However, the consular office representatives claimed that the goods could be transported away first, and then the procedures could be completed later. Furthermore, since the goods were transferred from the Beining Railway, why didn't Tianjin Customs inspect them and only detain them in Jinan? Li replied that it was precisely because the goods hadn't gone through customs procedures in Tianjin that they were being inspected and detained in Jinan. By 12:00 PM, there was still no resolution. At this time, Li Tonghua sent an urgent telegram to Tianjin Customs, requesting instructions on how to handle the situation. He also declared to the transporters that after waiting three or four hours, Tianjin should reply. If they allowed the release, he would allow the loading and unloading. Seeing that they were getting nowhere, more than 50 people crowded into the first-class waiting room and turned to negotiate with Station Master Wang of Jinan Station. They collectively said, "The Chinese are unreasonable. Our goods are transported by the Jinpu Railway. We only need to pick them up at the Jinan Station of the Jinpu Railway. We don't recognize any customs personnel in Jinan because we don't know about them, and our consulate hasn't received any notice. This Mr. Li must be an imposter deliberately making things difficult." After saying this, they forcibly ordered Station Master Wang to retrieve the goods from the freight yard, saying, "We will transport them ourselves." Wang replied that since the customs personnel did not allow unloading, he could not bear this responsibility. The stalemate lasted for a long time. Around 1:00 PM, the transporters, seeing that there was still no result, said to Station Master Wang, "You have counted our goods." Wang said, "Of course." The transporters then asked to see the freight yard, but Wang initially refused. After obtaining Li Tonghua's consent, they went to the freight yard together. The transporters saw that the original train had not been moved. They asked why they weren't allowed to unload. Wang and others said that they were not allowed to leave, but unloading was allowed. The station staff then unloaded the white sugar. It was already 3:00 PM. The transporters still had no solution and dispersed. How this matter will be handled in the future depends on negotiations.

<h3 id="e85">Details of Li Shengda's Assassination <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Senior officials from Yan's faction thoroughly investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Li Shengda, a member of the Central Executive Committee and commander of the 19th Army, was suddenly assassinated at around 4:00 AM on the 30th of this month while inspecting defenses in Lishi County. He was shot in the head, a vital point, and died on the spot. The assassin was also shot and killed on the spot by Li's guards. Li was a prominent general in Shanxi Province and highly trusted by Jiang. Therefore, the news of his death caused widespread shock and grief. The details of the assassination and its aftermath are recorded below:</p>
<p>Details of the Assassination: According to Li Mingding, the chief of staff of the army, Commander Li was ordered to depart on the 26th of this month to Lishi to supervise his troops in crossing the river to Shaanxi to suppress the remnants of bandits. After Commander Li arrived in Lishi, he stayed at the Xiangji Company's kerosene store. Commander Li's stationing in a commercial firm was originally a temporary measure, as he did not want to affect the business of the firm. Therefore, although he was stationed inside the firm, the gate was not heavily guarded so that the firm could operate freely. Commander Li had been extremely busy in recent days coordinating the departure of his troops and handling military affairs. On the morning of the 29th, he gave a speech to a departing unit. On the morning of the 30th, as dawn was breaking, Li got up to give another speech. Just as he was preparing to depart, a rioter suddenly broke in and opened fire on Li. Li's guards, hearing the sound, rushed in and realized that it was an assassination attempt. In haste, they drew their pistols and returned fire on the rioter. Since the bullets hit vital points, Commander Li died immediately, and the rioter also died on the spot. Military personnel rushed to the scene to investigate and handle the aftermath. The speaker (Chief Li himself) hurriedly returned to the province to report. As for the origin of the rioter and whether he had any background, there are no clues yet.</p>
<p>Li's Brief Biography: Li Shengda, courtesy name Shumin, is currently 45 years old. He is from Jincheng County, Shanxi Province. He graduated from Baoding Military Academy. He rose through the ranks of the Shanxi military from the lowest level to his current position. In 1923, he was credited for defending Fanshi City during the Yanbei campaign. Within a year, he was promoted from battalion commander to division commander. During the Northern Expedition, the Shanxi army expanded, and he was appointed army commander. After the recovery of Tianjin and Beijing, he also served as the commander of the Pingjin Railway. In 1930, the Shanxi army was reorganized, and he was reduced to division commander under Fu Zuoyi. In the winter of the previous year, he was telegraphed by Chairman Jiang to go to Jiangxi. The division was reorganized into the 19th Army, and Li remained the commander. In the summer of last year, he was ordered to return to Shanxi and was appointed deputy commander of the Shaanxi Bandit Suppression Force. Last winter, he attended the Fifth Plenary Session as a representative of the Shanxi military and was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. This time, due to his meritorious service in suppressing bandits in western Shanxi, Yan greatly expanded the army and ordered him to lead the troops to Shaanxi to pursue and suppress the bandits to complete the mission.</p>
<p>Family Situation: Li came from a farming family. Both of his parents have passed away. He had five brothers. His eldest brother has also passed away. Li was the second oldest. His fourth brother, Li Shenglian, is an inspector for the provincial government. His fifth brother is currently residing in the province. The son of his eldest brother, Wenbin, serves as a counselor for the Suiyuan headquarters and principal of the Jincheng Huzhe Middle School. Li left behind four sons and one daughter. The eldest son is already over twenty years old and is currently studying at the Nanjing Central Military Academy. The rest are studying in the province. His wife is at home, and his concubine is currently residing in the province.</p>
<p>Li's Life: Li was a veteran general in the National Army. After graduating from Baoding Military Academy, he served in Shanxi Province. He was generous and had great integrity. He was meticulous in his duties, so he was valued by his superiors and admired by his colleagues. He was promoted to his current position. He experienced many battles and achieved significant military achievements. Chairman Jiang and Vice Chairman Yan both treated him with special favor. In the previous year, when the central government requisitioned the Shanxi army, Vice Chairman Yan planned to send a unit to Jiangxi. Li readily accepted the order, as he was dedicated to serving the Party and the country and fighting for the group. He had a clear vision and showed a deep understanding of righteousness. After arriving in Jiangxi, he spared no effort in searching for and suppressing the remnants of bandits. He captured important bandit leader Huang Zhichao and many important members of the bandit group and brought them to justice, causing the disintegration of several thousand Red bandits. Therefore, the Red bandits hated him intensely. Li emphasized discipline and loved the people when leading troops. He was always sincere in his words and actions. Wherever he went, he committed no offenses. When he was stationed in Ji'an for eight months, the local people all loved and respected him. When he was ordered to return to Shanxi last year, the people of Ji'an even sent telegrams to the central government to request him to stay. He was so highly respected. This is why Chairman Jiang and Vice Chairman Yan valued him even more. At the Fifth Plenary Session, he was elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee. He was naturally honest and treated people with great respect. He had a strong sense of national identity. Therefore, he was always willing to take responsibility. He was a rare talent of the times. Now he was killed by bandits before completing his mission. It is a great loss to our Party, our country, and Shanxi Province. Therefore, everyone who heard the news felt deep sorrow.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Aftermath: After the news of Li's assassination reached the province, Chairman Yan specially ordered Feng Pengzhu, the adjutant of the Suiyuan headquarters, to represent him in Lishi to handle Li's funeral arrangements and strictly investigate the cause of the assassination. Feng left this morning at 4:00 AM with Wang Jingguo, the commander of the 70th Division, by car to Lishi. Feng and Wang will stay there for about three or two days and then return to Taiyuan. Yan also convened a meeting of senior military officials in Taiyuan at the Suiyuan headquarters last night at 6:00 PM to discuss Li's funeral arrangements. It is said that Commander Li's body was placed in a coffin yesterday afternoon. All the coffins and other items were purchased and sent to Lishi by Chairman Yan. After the coffin was placed, the military, political, and academic circles of Lishi went to pay their respects. The coffin has been transported from Lishi to Taiyuan. After the coffin arrives in Taiyuan, it will be transported to his private residence on Beimen Street. It has been decided to establish a funeral committee, led by Li's friends Yang Wenqing and others, to handle all matters. Funeral services such as chanting scriptures and public memorial services will be held on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Miscellaneous Writings on the Rural Areas of Hubei <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>(15) What I Saw and Heard in Gucheng</p>
<p>Going north from Laohekou is the passage to Shaanxi, known as the Lao-Bai Road, which starts from Kou, passes through Gucheng, Jun County, Yunyang, and ends in Baihe, Shaanxi. It has great significance in military, political, and commercial terms. However, I heard that the director of the road bureau and local officials who presided over the construction of the road in the past had unspeakable difficulties. The construction of the roadbed, road surface, bridges, and culverts was extremely sloppy. The road surface was uneven, and the car traveled as if in a cloud. Passengers often hit their heads and bled. Once it rained, traffic would be blocked for days or even months. The government and the people suffered losses together. The road construction workers were conscripted locally without paying a penny, but the construction funds allocated by the government still reached more than 500,000 yuan. It is a great sigh that the Chinese people are unwilling to take things seriously. Recently, Wang Qiang, the director of the provincial highway bureau, has been trying his best to rectify it, but the northern section has been washed away by the water, and it is unknown when it will be repaired. Moreover, the staff at the road stations have a kind of arrogance, often insulting passengers. The staff at Kou Station are particularly bad. Passengers say that they are "as stupid as deer and pigs, as fierce as jackals and wolves," which is somewhat similar. It is difficult to reverse the accumulation of problems, and the whip is out of reach. The reporter boarded the car from Kou, not knowing where it could drive to, and let it rest northward. After traveling sixty miles to Gucheng, the road was blocked again due to a wind and rain overnight, and I was detained for several days.</p>
<p>The city was the fief of Duke Gu in the Zhou Dynasty, and later it was Zhuyang. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Xianzhong's rebellion started here. Now it belongs to the Fifth Administrative Inspectorate District of Xiangyang. The atmosphere is extremely closed. Once you enter its territory, spring couplets such as "There are no two masters in the sky, only one supreme in the world" and "The emperor's grace is as vast as spring, and the cultural rule is as bright as the sun" often catch the eye, making people laugh and cry. Later, I heard that the county not only has low public intelligence, but also the education sector is the same. Moreover, there are many factions. There is a central primary school in the county seat. The principal is an old and decaying person with bad habits. Many teachers are incompetent. The special party headquarters of the 82nd Division used to be stationed here and ran a teacher research class. When the party headquarters was transferred, it came to an abrupt end. The trained teachers were all squeezed out. The education funds reach 20,000 yuan per year, but only 14,000 yuan is used, and the rest is unknown.</p>
<p>Although the countryside has suffered from years of drought and floods, its vitality has not been completely lost. Agricultural products include cotton, beans, wheat, millet, rice, and corn. Mountain areas produce tung oil, wood oil, mushrooms, medicinal materials, and fire paper. Land is measured in acres, with five feet square as one bow, and 240 square bows as one acre. Some use the area worked by a farmer's hoe or a bull's plow in a day as the standard of measurement, which is not accurate. There are many landlords. The top money exceeds one-third of the original value of the land, so capital is concentrated in the hands of landlords. Now it is a spring famine and rice is expensive, with each stone rising to fifteen yuan. Rich households hoard and speculate, unwilling to sell. In the Lengjiaji and Xinjiaji areas, there have been incidents of starving people smearing their faces with ink and gathering to rob rice. When the army rushed to the scene, they had already dispersed.</p>
<p>Last year's flood drowned thousands of people, and the city walls were destroyed. At that time, a certain division headquarters and special party headquarters were stationed here and worked hard to rescue them, saving the lives of tens of thousands of people. Later, the government allocated 20,000 yuan to the county government to handle agricultural relief. Because the seeds were sold at inflated prices and the soybeans were watered, the disaster victims returned them one after another. The county magistrate was dismissed because of this. Now in the spring relief, another 5,000 yuan has been received to repair the city and purchase grain for distribution. The purchased grain is corn, and it has not been distributed yet due to difficulties. Each work is two dimes, and it is heard that some disaster workers have not received funding, for some reason.</p>
<p>People are prone to litigation, and some sue for generations over trivial matters. There are not a few smokers. There are three soil plaster shops in the county seat, paying 400 yuan in Ding and other taxes per shop. There are also many prostitutes, and sanitation is not taken seriously. When the reporter arrived in the county, it was the time when the order was given to drive away prostitutes and carry out a cleanliness campaign, all of which were presided over by the army and the government. The Zhu regiment stationed there has been effective in maintaining law and order and assisting the people in building and repairing city dikes and streets, which it advocates, and the people praise it very much. The county magistrate is also quite capable and has as many as five wives and concubines, but it is said that he has not neglected his duties. He said, "Revitalizing the countryside does not require much talk, it only needs to maintain law and order and reduce exploitation." It can be said to be pertinent. The hope of all the peasants in Hubei is nothing more than this, and it is not only true of Gucheng County.</p>
<p>The gentry power in the area is quite high, especially with the Financial Affairs Committee as the backbone. The finances are controlled by them. Whether local undertakings can be smoothly promoted depends on the will of the chairman of the Financial Affairs Committee. Those who come to lead this place must be connected, otherwise, their administration will be subject to many restraints. This kind of evil force needs to be eradicated urgently.

<h3 id="e87">Smuggled Sugar Seized Again in Bengbu <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Forty-two bags of tax-evading sugar, transported to Shanghai for customs handling.</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Smuggling in North China is like a raging tide, becoming increasingly unstoppable. Bengbu, located at the throat of the Jinpu Railway, connecting the north and the south, has become a place where tax-evading goods openly arrive in a continuous stream. After arriving in Bengbu, they are then distributed to various counties in northern Anhui. Since the establishment of the Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office of the Customs for preventing road transport smuggling in Bengbu, customs officers have been diligently inspecting passenger and freight cars coming from the north on the Jinpu Railway at the station every day. If tax-evading smuggled goods (i.e., goods without tax receipts) are found, they are detained. After more than 4,000 bags of smuggled sugar were seized at the freight station, smugglers have become wary and often try to circumvent the inspection by secretly transporting goods. However, the Bengbu District Consolidated Tax Administration, while inspecting privately made cigarette paper, inadvertently seized 42 bags of smuggled sugar in Songjiatan, eight miles away from Bengbu. The people and goods were taken to the office for questioning. After that, the smuggled sugar was transferred to the customs' Bengbu Inspection Office, loaded into a car that night, and transported to Shanghai for customs handling. Today (1st), the Inspection Office received a tip that a large number of smuggled sugar was being transported by ship to Shouxian. It has already made a long-distance phone call to the Shouxian authorities to intercept it.</p>

<p>The Japanese are actively planning to exploit them. The location is in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River.</p>
<p>Qiqihar Dispatch: The North Manchuria Gold Mining Co., Ltd., established by the Japanese, previously centered on the four major creeks in the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River. With the help of the puppet organization, they forcibly obtained extensive mining rights, planning to extract placer gold. Since last summer, they have transported gold dredges and other necessities. However, due to freezing, they temporarily suspended operations, waiting for the ice to thaw this spring to resume work. Therefore, the company recently recruited technicians and workers to manufacture gold dredges, and all preparations have been made early. They are now constructing gold dredges and will officially start work within three months.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the provincial anti-smoking policy, smoking cases have been handled by the county government. Since County Magistrate Li took office, he has repeatedly warned his subordinates to be honest and sincere. If there is any violation of the law or dereliction of duty, once reported, they will be investigated and dealt with according to the law. However, recently, a repeat offender named Zhang Daosheng attempted to obtain bail and asked a Jin to bribe Wu Taizhao, the clerk of the county government's trial room, to find a way. Xu Ziqing, who relayed it, was also involved in the bribery. When County Magistrate Li heard about this, he was furious and ordered them to be taken into custody last night. After a strict interrogation this morning, he ordered them to be sent to the local court for trial.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of last month, various institutions in the county sent representatives to the provincial and financial departments to petition for the postponement of the house tax collection. The result was not very satisfactory. It is now heard that the preparatory committee of the county's Beijing Association has sent a special telegram requesting that the postponement be vigorously pursued. The original telegram is as follows: Kunshan County Party Department forwarded to various public law organizations for your reference: County Magistrate Peng Baichuan has violated laws and decrees, harshly collecting house taxes, dereliction of duty and harming the people. The fellow villagers in Beijing are all furious. After a meeting on May 31, in addition to jointly filing charges with various departments, we specially telegraphed your ministry to transfer to various public law organizations to take care of the people's suffering and strive for reason together. No amount should be added beyond the 8,910 yuan determined for the 24th fiscal year. Please do not decline, we are extremely hopeful.

<p>The Wu County community has organized the "Association for Promoting the Purchase of Aircraft to Celebrate Birthday" to actively raise funds for the purchase of aircraft to celebrate. The theaters and performing arts circles in Suzhou have successively held theatrical performances to raise funds, with excellent results. Various industries have also sent letters from the County Chamber of Commerce to raise funds. The Promotion Association convened various agencies, schools, and labor service corps in Zhongshan Hall at 10:00 AM on the 4th to discuss expanding publicity and fundraising. At that time, it was decided to organize a propaganda team, which would be divided into groups to designate areas and conduct publicity and fundraising, issuing receipts at any time as proof. The fundraising period is limited to two weeks and will end immediately. Once the funds are raised, they will be remitted to the central government for the purchase of aircraft. The fundraising goal for this county is 30,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Administrative Inspectorate of the Second District instructed the county governments of Wuxi, Suzhou, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Jin, because the accumulation of supplies in each county in the district is different, either the amount of grain accumulated is small, or the deposited funds have not been used to purchase grain. And most counties often only have county warehouses, and many have no district, township, or town warehouses. If there is an extraordinary disaster, the entire damage can easily occur. It is necessary to prepare warehouses, pay attention to separate storage to prevent against potential issues. As for the amount stored, efforts must be made to increase it to achieve the purpose of actual preparation. At the same time, efforts should be made to advocate for the expansion of voluntary warehouses and private reserves, so that those who are enthusiastic about public welfare can happily donate, and those who are usually good at saving can store more, so as to achieve both public and private progress.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Plans to Build a Large-Scale Shopping Mall <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>This city is located in the center of Beijing and Shanghai, with convenient transportation and a prosperous commercial market. In recent years, due to the decline of the silk market, it has been in a slump, and the market has been slightly affected. Recently, after automobiles have traveled on various highways and connected neighboring counties, merchants have gathered, so various industries in the city have slightly turned around. Merchants from various places believe that there is no large-scale shopping mall established in this city, so they propose to raise one million yuan to build a perfect department store. Yesterday, several Guangdong merchants came to Wuxi to inspect the site. They inspected the land behind the railway police section near the train station, which is dozens of acres of open space, as a site for construction. It is heard that the merchants have submitted an application to the Ministry of Industry for approval.</p>

<p>Deng Afu, a resident of Zhang Lane No. 13 outside Guangmen in this city, was 52 years old. He used to make a living by pulling water chestnuts. On the 31st of last month, Afu was again playing a water chestnut-pulling game with Zhou Yaoting, the owner of the Zhou Shunxing Iron Factory near Huinong Bridge. Because of a dispute over winning and losing, an argument broke out, followed by a physical fight. At that time, Afu suffered a serious kick to his lower abdomen. Although he invited injury specialist Wei Yunrui and doctors from Puren Hospital to diagnose and treat him, because Afu was old and seriously injured, he died yesterday (the 5th) morning. Deng He'er, the son of the deceased, reported it to the responsible public security branch, which sent police to arrest the murderer Zhou Yaoting and related persons Zhu Xigen and Li Yongyuan. They were presented to the general bureau and transferred to the local court for trial at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Changshu Also Discovers Smuggled Goods in This City <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the issue of foreign goods smuggling has spread throughout the country. Various towns along the river in this area are also full of smuggled goods, especially white sugar. In the Hupu area, more than ten catties of white sugar can be exchanged for one national currency dollar. It is heard that these smuggled goods are transferred from Baimao Port. There are several merchants in that area who have formed a group and specially hired sandboats to transport goods from Lushun and Dalian. The goods are rayon, white sugar, matches, and newsprint. Before the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, these merchants had already started their activities, so the amount of their transportation is impossible to estimate. It is said that the rayon smuggling seized in Wuxi was transferred from Baimao in this city. The authorities have learned of the previous situation and are investigating.</p>

<p>The Dada Steamer Company in Zhenjiang arrived in Zhenjiang at 8 p.m. on the 3rd, departing from Sishui. One of the passengers had a handbag and luggage with him. After the ship docked, the passenger looked flustered. Yang Zhicai, a customs tax police officer from Zhenhai Customs, found him suspicious and stepped forward to interrogate him. After searching him, he found 902 yuan of foreign silver in his handbag and luggage without a pass. He was considered to be smuggling, so the person and the silver were taken to the customs for disposal. According to customs news, the provincial government has ordered the Wujin county government to send Chen Ruiding, a sugar smuggler, and 120 bags of smuggled sugar to Zhenhai Customs for handling. The county has sent a letter to Zhen Customs explaining the situation. The Customs sent personnel to Wujin on the 4th to verify and escort the smugglers and smuggled goods to Zhenjiang for handling.</p>

<p>The Water Police Third Detachment stationed in Xiangshan has been patrolling the waters of Sanmen Bay for days to protect fishermen. Recently, they received a secret report from fishermen that a robbery occurred in the waters of Tianwan. They immediately rushed to the scene of the incident to pursue and suppress.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also prevents smuggling, and each station of the railway is only responsible for inspecting its tax bill as proof, which is also implemented at the same time.</p>

Yesterday (the 3rd), the association held a regular meeting and resolved to:</p>
<p>* Give Taishun 2,000 yuan in relief funds.</p>
<p>* Give Pingyang 4,000 yuan in relief funds.</p>

<p>The citrus fruits of Huangyan, Yongjia, and other places in Zhejiang Province have always enjoyed a great reputation. However, due to the lack of scientific improvement, production is declining. The Construction Department has decided to open a horticulture field in Huangyan to engage in improvement. The Ministry of Industry has dispatched Zhang Jingou, a technician from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, to go to Huangyan to survey the site, and the Ministry and the Province will jointly carry out work such as improving varieties, packaging, and marketing in order to develop foreign sales channels. As for the remaining output, it is planned to manufacture orange juice, and this is currently under study.</p>

<p>Spoke about diplomatic policy as in previous speeches</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, accompanied by Chen Jie, the permanent director of the Foreign Ministry, Li Dijun, the director of the Intelligence Department, and Secretary Duan Guanhai, left Nanjing on the 11:00 PM express train the night before last and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning.

<h3 id="e106">Municipal Government Tea Party Last Night <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Hosted Minister Zhang and His Wife and Chinese and Foreign Guests</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government hosted a gathering of Chinese and foreign guests from all walks of life in the city yesterday to strengthen friendship. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, Mayor Wu and his wife held this year's spring tea party in the Municipal Government Auditorium, hosting Minister Zhang of the Foreign Ministry and his wife, ambassadors, ministers, charges d'affaires, military commanders, military attachés, consuls general, and Chinese and foreign guests from all walks of life, totaling about 1,800 people. Mayor Wu and his wife, as well as senior officials of the municipal government, warmly greeted them and introduced them to Minister Zhang and his wife. The guests and hosts toasted and chatted happily, and the area in the city center was bustling with traffic, a grand scene for a time.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Situation is Peaceful and Stable Shanghai's Financial Situation is Stable <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Interbank lending rates are calm, bill exchange is sharply increasing, foreign exchange is stable, and national banks are supplying as much as possible. Bond prices in the stock exchange are rising across the board.</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that although some unfounded rumors have been circulating in the Shanghai financial market, the financial market is still very stable. Securities trading has rebounded across the board. Although the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association has risen by one point compared to the previous week, this is purely due to supply and demand and is not affected by rumors. The public single lending rate and the acceptance bill discount rate of the Bank United Reserve Association are the same as the previous week. Although foreign exchange has fluctuated slightly, the changes are very small. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates are Calm as Usual</p>
<p>The financial market in the city has been generally calm since this week. The interbank lending rate opened by the Money Trade Association has been at 9 points except on Sunday, but it has risen by one point compared to last week. This is because the demand for cash this week is slightly higher, which is entirely due to the relationship between supply and demand. The public single lending rate opened by the Bank United Reserve Committee has always been listed at one dime (10 cents), and the discount rate for its acceptance bills has also not changed, remaining at one dime and two points (12 cents). This shows a glimpse of the financial stability of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Bill Exchange Volume Increases Sharply</p>
<p>The total amount of bill exchange in the banking and money industries in this port has increased sharply compared to last week. The total amount of exchange in the Banking Association is 374,293,057.72 yuan in national currency, an increase of 166,841,179.66 yuan compared to the previous period of 207,451,878.06 yuan. The exchange volume, transfer volume, and total collection volume also increased sharply like the total amount. The total amount of bill exchange in the Money Trade Association this week was 310,902,500 yuan, an increase of 27,558,000 yuan compared to the previous period of 293,344,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market is Slightly Active</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market in Shanghai this week has been slightly active. The near-term price of British exchange is 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 375 points. The amount purchased at this price is quite large, but the national banks are supplying as much as possible to stabilize it. Therefore, British exchange has always stood firm at the selling price of the Central Bank. The forward price of British exchange is tightening. On Thursday, the British exchange for June shrank from 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 34375 points to 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 3125 points, and the July term shrank from 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 3125 points to 28125 points. As for the US exchange, it has become looser. The near-term price has increased from 29 yuan and 8125 points to 29 yuan and 875 points. From Wednesday, the forward price has increased by 0625 points for each month. On Friday, the price of the US exchange for June reached 29 yuan and 8125 points, and the July term reached 29 yuan and 75 points. The reason for the tightening of foreign exchange this week is entirely due to the collusion between Japanese banks and Chinese merchants, and the relatively tight financial situation at the end of the month also has an impact. However, pure commercial transactions this week are relatively rare, while bank-to-bank transactions and speculative trading are more prosperous.</p>
<p>The Amount of Legal Tender Issued Has Increased</p>
<p>According to the inspection report on Saturday, the amount issued by the Central Bank is 277,775,264 yuan, an increase of 1,710,460 yuan compared to the previous period of 276,064,836 yuan. The cash reserve has also increased considerably, namely 982,828 yuan. As for the amount issued by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, according to the Sixth Inspection Report of the Issuing Reserve Committee, the former is 343,155,286 yuan and the latter is 201,401,740 yuan, and the cash reserves are also maintained at a considerable level.</p>

<p>Specially Appointed Customs Officers to be Stationed at Stations for Inspection</p>
<p>In order to prevent smuggling by road transport, the Jianghai Customs has issued a notice stipulating the method of obtaining tax-paid certificates, which has been implemented since the 3rd of this month. The first notice issued by Ansier, the director of the Chief Inspectorate, is recorded as follows: According to the notice issued by the Inspector General of Customs and approved by the Executive Yuan on measures to prevent smuggling by road transport, we are instructed to comply with it immediately, etc. According to the regulations of the aforementioned measures, all foreign goods transported by railway must have a tax-paid certificate issued by the customs; otherwise, the railway bureau will refuse to transport them. In the future, if foreign goods listed in the attached list are transported by railway without this certificate, they may be seized by the customs officers stationed at the arrival station. Merchants can obtain this certificate free of charge from the customs where the goods were originally imported or re-exported by presenting various documents for import duties that have been paid. The goods listed in the attached table may be changed at any time depending on the circumstances. In addition to the procedures for applying for the certificate, which will be announced by the Customs Tax Department, this notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. This notice, Director Ansier (attached table omitted).</p>
<p>The Shanghai North and South Stations of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, and the McGonaghy Road Freight Station, are the overall hubs of Shanghai's vehicle transport and are extremely important. The Jianghai Customs specially appointed Yaleson, the Western Chief Inspector, yesterday to lead customs officers to establish inspection offices at the above stations. Six customs officers were stationed at each office, rotating regularly to inspect smuggled goods, and railway police cooperated in handling the matter. When necessary, they could inspect the vehicles and deal with them strictly.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Industry and Commerce Loan Association Approved Loan Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Totaling 12,350 yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its 30th meeting at the Bank of China National Goods in Tianjin Road at half past noon on the day of this month. The committee members present were Cai Zengji, Qin Runqing, Song Ziliang, Yu Zuoyan, Du Yuesheng, (Yu acting for) Wang Xiaolai, Bei Songsun, (Wang acting for) Wu Xingya, and (Wu Huanru acting for) the aforementioned gentlemen. Chairman Cai Zengji reported on the routine affairs of the meeting and then presented thirty-one applications for small credit loans. After review and decision, one company was approved for half of the original application amount, and thirty companies were approved for a reduced amount, for a total loan of 12,350 yuan. In addition, five companies were rejected for loans because their business activities were inconsistent with the loan principles or because the loan applications were inconsistent with the regulations. All reviewed cases will be notified to the respective applicants by the association. According to the three loan principles set by the Ministry of Finance, all factories that sell domestic goods, transport domestic goods for export, and manufacture domestic goods can apply for loans from the association without the need for any introduction. Recently, it has been reported that some cunning people have taken advantage of the ignorance of merchants and used the excuse of introducing loans to take the opportunity to make profits. It is also said that there are not a few who have been deceived, but no conclusive evidence has been obtained. It is also heard that the association is strictly investigating this matter in order to eliminate this malpractice as much as possible and to facilitate merchants. It is hoped that factories that want to apply for loans in the future will pay close attention. If there is any uncertainty about the loan procedures, they should go to the association's office on the upper floor of the Bank of China National Goods on Tianjin Road to inquire and avoid being deceived by villains.</p>

Among them, the "League of Young Russians" has followed the Soviet Union in chanting anti-Japanese slogans and has published "The Psychology of Russian Youth."

<p>Chen and Li's Attitudes Toward the Situation are Consistent</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, returned from northern Guangdong on the 2nd, passed through Shanghai and returned to Nanjing to meet with President Jiang and other central figures to report on the trip to Guangdong to commemorate Mr. Hu. He arrived in Shanghai on the night express train at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and met with reporters from the New News Agency at the Sino-French National Institute of Technology. He did not recognize the talk in foreign newspapers about the southwestern abnormal situation. Chu said that when we met with Chen and Li and others in Guangdong last time, their attitudes toward the situation were the same. They all believed that the national crisis was not over and that we should unite as one. Various rumors are not credible. There may be provocations in between. Our decision to go to Guangdong was entirely to commemorate Mr. Hu Zhantang. After passing through Shanghai and returning to Nanjing the night before last, I reported the trip to President Jiang and other central comrades before the Central Political Committee meeting the morning before. At the same time, I have inspected the National Assembly Hall once. The construction project is expected to be completed by the end of September, and the internal layout must be completed before the end of October. Chu also mentioned that Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Central Political Committee is recuperating in Germany and must wait until all his illnesses are completely cured and his health is restored before he can talk about returning. It is difficult to say whether I can return to attend before the National Assembly, but for the sake of the personal well-being of the teacher and for the sake of the country, we should not be too hasty in the teacher's return to the country, because only when a person is physically sound can he be competent and happy in governing affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Japan Increases Troops in North China and Protects Smuggling. Various Organizations Telegraph the Central Government for Negotiations, Requesting That a Serious Protest Be Lodged with the Japanese Side, Striving to Achieve the Goal of Ensuring Sovereignty and Integrity. <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Although our side has repeatedly negotiated with Japan regarding the increase of troops in North China and the protection of smugglers, it has not been effective. Various organizations, including the General Labor Union of the city, telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting that a serious protest be lodged with the Japanese side, striving to achieve the goal of ensuring sovereignty and integrity. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>General Labor Union Telegram</p>
<p>The General Labor Union of the city telegraphed the central government yesterday, writing, "To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of Nanjing: Japan, under the pretext of the Boxer Protocol, protects overseas Chinese and increases troops in North China, obstructs customs officers from cracking down on smuggling, hinders our country's sovereignty, and destroys our country's finances. Although the government has repeatedly negotiated seriously, the results have not been achieved due to the Japanese side's strong attitude. According to Articles 7 and 9 of the Boxer Protocol, countries are only allowed to station troops in Beijing and along the Pingyu Railway to protect the safety of the embassies. It was not originally for the purpose of protecting overseas Chinese, so there is no need to station heavy troops. The fact that countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Italy have never stationed heavy troops in Beijing and Tianjin is not difficult to see. Now that the embassies in Beijing and the transportation in Tianjin are not in any danger, they want to use this as an excuse to station heavy troops. Sima Zhao's intentions are known to everyone. Regarding the smuggling incident in North China, although the Japanese are trying to cover up the world with all kinds of sophistry, the facts are all there and cannot be denied. In short, Japan, under the name of the Boxer Protocol and the Tanggu Truce, is actually destroying sovereignty and protecting smuggling, trying to threaten the government. We hereby urgently telegraph you (the Yuan and the Ministry) to argue according to reason and strive to achieve the goal of withdrawing troops and ensuring the integrity of sovereignty. With the utmost urgency. Zhou Xuexiang, acting chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, and standing committee members Li Mengnan, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, Long Peiyun, and Ye Xiang, respectfully."</p>
<p>Municipal Farmers' Association Telegram</p>
<p>(Abbreviated title) The news that Japan has increased troops in North China and protected smuggling has spread and shocked the country. Japan's increase of troops in North China is based on the pretext of the Boxer Protocol, using the name of protecting overseas Chinese and practicing the reality of coercion. The intention is obvious. Moreover, the various clauses contained in the Boxer Protocol are based on the situation at that time, so there are regulations to adapt to the situation, station troops in Beijing and along the Pingyu Railway, and protect embassies and overseas Chinese. There is no need to station heavy troops as if facing a great enemy. Moreover, times have changed, and it should not be forced to argue, to splice, to invoke the treaty, and to deceive oneself and others. In view of the fact that countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Italy have never strongly supported the treaty and stationed heavy troops in Beijing and Tianjin, while the overseas Chinese are still living in peace, this proves that Japan's sudden increase in troops must be for other purposes. At a time when Sino-Japanese relations are gradually improving, it is a hindrance to promoting good relations. As for the issue of smuggling, it has a huge impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Tianjin is a major town in North China and a commercial hub. At present, smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly serious, and national tax revenue has been sharply reduced as a result. Not only will the national finances suffer losses, but the people of the whole country will also suffer. I dare to telegraph you (the Yuan) to ask you to lodge a serious protest with Japan in accordance with the law and to show the facts to friendly countries and await public opinion. I am waiting for your orders. Respectfully, the Shanghai Farmers' Association."</p>
<p>Issued a Declaration</p>
<p>The association issued a declaration yesterday, roughly stating that Japan is obstructing our customs from cracking down on smuggling, resulting in the rampant smuggling of goods in the market, which is enough to lead our industry and commerce to bankruptcy. After repeated negotiations, there have been no results. However, the Japanese side claims that it is based on the Tanggu Agreement. The Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce stipulates that there are strict regulations to prevent smuggling at all ports of commerce, and the anti-smuggling is under the jurisdiction of the customs police, which is different from the nature of the military and should not be subject to the Tanggu Agreement. Recently, it has borrowed words to protect overseas Chinese and increase troops in North China, claiming to be based on the Boxer Protocol. This treaty is purely for the safety of the embassies and cannot be used to protect overseas Chinese, and the responsibility for protecting overseas Chinese has been clearly stipulated in the Treaty of Commerce and rests with our country. Therefore, this move is purely without reason. (New News Agency)</p>

<p>The Hankou domestic wireless telephone station, after the Ministry of Communications established an engineering office and determined Lujiadun, Zhanggong Dike, as the base for the station, has been under construction since the year before last. It was originally expected to be completed around November of last year, but the initial construction work was washed away by a major flood, causing the project to be delayed. After the floodwaters receded, construction was resumed, and the entire project was completed at the end of last month. The equipment has been installed, and the office has notified the Ministry of Communications International Wireless Radio Station on Renji Road in this city to prepare for the opening of trial calls between the two sides. The domestic wireless telephone in the Shanghai Zhenru Wireless Transceiver Station has already exchanged trial calls with the Hankou Lujiadun station since the early morning, with excellent results. Once the Ministry decides on a date, official telephone service will be opened.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Announcement from the Garrison Headquarters: Strictly Prohibiting Extortion Under False Pretenses; Family Members of Offenders Must Not Solicit Bribes; Those Who Dare to Violate Will Be Strictly Investigated <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Announcement from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters: It has been investigated that the military law office of this headquarters handles cases with the principle of speedy resolution without injustice or leniency. However, in order to discover the truth and avoid unjust leniency, it is necessary to strive for thoroughness in summoning witnesses, investigating arguments, and studying the case. Recently, it has been found that some offenders or their family members, hoping to escape the law or be released early, have engaged in bribery. For example, Zhao F茂, the family member of drug offender Zhao Zhongfan, was defrauded of several hundred yuan while entrusting someone to find a way. All the fraudulent offenders have been arrested and interrogated by this headquarters. This kind of behavior not only wastes money but also violates laws and regulations, amounting to adding crime upon crime, which is both pitiful and detestable. This headquarters enforces the law strictly, and all staff members also cherish self-respect. Those who are guilty will not be allowed to escape the law, and those who are innocent will not be allowed to suffer injustice. There will be no deviations due to the lobbying of offenders or their family members, and bribes will never be accepted to violate the law. Therefore, a special announcement is made to all prisoners in custody: From now on, you must wait patiently for the trial. All family members of offenders must not engage in bribery again. Those who dare to violate will be severely punished. If there are unscrupulous elements who spread rumors under false names and extort money under pretexts, please report them secretly to this headquarters for strict investigation and handling. All must comply. This announcement is made on June 3rd, the 25th year of the Republic of China. Commander Yang Hu.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Representatives of Foundry Workers in the City Petitioned the Party Headquarters Yesterday, Requesting that Employers Be Ordered Not to Arrest Workers <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Fuxing Foundry on Qiwu Pu Road in Pudong reported the arrest of worker Ni Lounian to the police, causing a reaction from workers in various foundries throughout the city, who went on strike in succession to show support. After persuasion by personnel from the city party headquarters, work was resumed. However, as the workers' demands had not been resolved, yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, more than 120 representatives from various factories gathered at the city party headquarters to petition. Zhu Rongsheng was elected as the plenipotentiary representative. Li Weixiong, a cadre from the Civil Movement Section of the city party headquarters, received them and expressed acceptance of the workers' demands. They dispersed around 2 o'clock in the afternoon. The petition is recorded as follows: To comply with the request of all representatives and lead the petition. According to the request of the representatives of various factories under the association, on May 26th, at 10 o'clock in the morning, Fan Guoan, the manager of Fuxing Foundry, led police officers into Shenji Foundry without notifying the person in charge of the factory or announcing the reason, and without showing any credentials, suddenly arresting worker Ni Lounian, thereby arousing the public anger of fellow workers in the city, who unanimously went on strike to show support. After reporting to your department for investigation, Mr. Li Weixiong, a representative, investigated the situation on both sides and instructed the representatives to give four points in person: It was determined that the responsibility for this strike event lies with the employer who should be responsible. The arrest of worker Ni Lounian will be assisted and resolved by the city party headquarters according to law. The wage loss caused by the strike due to this incident will be the responsibility of the city party headquarters representative, who will order the employer to give a discretionary amount. The workers must consider the overall situation and resume work together first. At that time, the representatives respected the meaning of the representatives of your department and believed in the prompts of their responsible persons, so they all retreated and persuaded the workers to resume work together first and wait quietly for resolution. However, a week has passed, and this wage has not been handled as instructed, and the workers have questioned one after another, and the representatives have no way to respond. Therefore, they led to your department to petition two items: Order the employer not to use oppressive means in the future, and arrest and detain workers out of suspicion. Wages during the strike period will be paid as usual on a scheduled date. We sincerely ask your department to sympathize with the difficulties of the workers and promptly handle it, which will be convenient for the workers.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Cotton Control Association Initiates a Jiangbei Cotton Area Inspection Tour, Inviting the Financial Sector to Depart on the Evening of the 10th <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>My country's cotton production is abundant, and Jiangsu is especially so. The various reclamation areas in Jiangbei have vast areas, from Lvsi Town in Nantong to Chenjiagang in Funing, spanning more than 600 li from north to south and about 100 li from east to west. Originally, it was a wasteland for storing grass and boiling salt. Although there are nearly 3.8 million mu of cultivated land, with an annual harvest of 600,000 dan of cotton, there are still more than 10 million mu of wasteland to be developed. Ge Qin, the commissioner of the Nantong District Supervisory Commissioner's Office, considering the importance of its relationship to the Chinese cotton industry, specially consulted with the Cotton Control Association to initiate an invitation to various cotton experts and banks engaged in agricultural finance to send representatives to visit the various reclamation companies. Those invited include the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, the Chung Nan Bank, the New China Bank, the Kwok Wah Bank, the Continental Bank, The Yieh Yeh Bank, the China National Products Bank, and cotton planting and textile experts from the Cotton Control Association, etc. They will depart from Shanghai on the evening of the 10th of this month, passing through Nantong, Hai'an, Dongtai, Xinyangji, Chenjiayangzi, Baojiadun, etc., for a total journey of about ten days. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Government has also sent five experts in water conservancy, agriculture, and cooperation to join the group and inspect together. It is also reported that Zhu Ziqiao, chairman of the Huainan Reclamation Federation, plans to personally go to receive them.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Chinese Yangtze River Pilots Petition: Transfer Management Authority to the Ministry of Communications; Representatives Went to Nanjing Yesterday; Request Assistance from All Sectors Again <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Yangtze River pilots are demanding the return of management authority, the abolition of the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, and the transfer of full management authority to the Ministry of Communications. This has been repeatedly called for and detailed in previous reports. It is now learned that the pilots have issued a second circular telegram yesterday, requesting assistance from all sectors, and have sent three representatives, including Feng Fucheng, to Nanjing to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and various relevant ministries and committees, in order to realize this as soon as possible, so as to maintain sovereignty and consolidate national defense. The full text of the circular telegram is recorded below: For the appreciation of national party and government organs, various people's organizations, and various newspapers: Since the former Qing government trusted foreign advisors and abandoned pilotage authority, in the seventh year of Tongzhi, Robert Hart, the British customs commissioner of Jianghai Customs, formulated the General Regulations for Pilotage, stipulating that foreigners could serve as pilots in our country. In addition, Daniel, a British shipping commissioner of the Shanghai River Shipping Bureau, assigned the waterway from Tongsha to Shanghai to a foreign pilotage organization for exclusive management, from which sovereignty was lost, foreign advisors manipulated things, and the Chinese people suffered. The pilotage industry declined tragically. We eagerly hoped that the government would take it back and manage it itself. Fortunately, our national government abolished the General Regulations for Pilotage formulated by Robert Hart in the twelfth year of the Republic of China and strived to recover pilotage authority. The Chinese people deeply rejoiced at being freed from the control of foreign advisors. Later, the Ministries of Finance, Navy, Communications, and the General Staff jointly formed the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee as an organization to manage foreign pilots. The Chinese people were delighted with this measure, believing that the Chinese people's pilotage industry would have a more reliable guarantee and would be able to flourish, so as to maintain sovereignty and consolidate national defense. Unexpectedly, since the establishment of the committee, all measures have been contrary to their purpose, turning against each other. Controlling Chinese pilots on the Yangtze River seemed to be the sole responsibility of the committee. The committee dared to act perversely, probably because the government did not consider it fully when establishing the committee, resulting in this problem. Although the committee was jointly organized by representatives from various departments, the Interim Regulations for Pilotage Management promulgated in the 22nd year of the Republic of China designated the customs patrol and river shipping bureaus as representatives of the Ministry of Finance and concurrently served as chairman and members, and representatives of foreign chambers of commerce participated in it, so that our sacred sovereignty still fell into the hands of foreign advisors. It is regrettable to say and causes anger to think about. Investigating the pilotage of ships entering and leaving ports and navigating rivers and seas is related to the mission of transportation and the security of national defense. All countries in the world strictly guard their borders and prohibit foreigners. Only our country trusts foreign advisors, erring once with Robert Hart and again with Daniel. Now, the chairman of the Shanghai Pilotage Management Committee, Cornell, is trying to control our people, and his intention is even more vicious than that of Robert Hart and Daniel. The danger of the matter is unsurpassed. In the past, French warships attacked the Min River port and Japanese warships penetrated the Liu River. The past events are not far away and can serve as a warning. Our association is saddened by what it sees and is duty-bound to safeguard sovereignty and consolidate national defense. In addition to having repeatedly presented to the relevant departments and painfully explained the pros and cons, urging rescue, the fundamental solution is to immediately abolish the Pilotage Management Committee and change it to be examined and issued licenses by the Ministry of Communications, and then managed and guided by the local maritime administration bureaus. The Legislative Yuan should promulgate the Pilotage Law to benefit the competent authorities and pilots, and establish a pilotage school to cultivate pilotage talents. At the same time, we should dismiss foreign pilots and recover pilotage rights, so that the Chinese people's pilotage industry can prosper and the gateway to the rivers and seas can be consolidated. Even if the aggressors have strong ships and cannons, they cannot enter our gateway, which will greatly benefit national defense. Although there are no treaty restrictions on banning foreign pilots, but the habit has been around for a long time, and it is not easy to ban them, and we are afraid that it will affect diplomacy. Our association is also well aware of this. How can we over-request the government? However, giving up eating because of choking is not the way to national rejuvenation. We must seek solutions through other means. Without affecting diplomacy or the livelihoods of foreign pilots currently serving, and while maintaining our sovereignty, the government should issue an order to all foreign pilots to apply to our competent authorities for examination and registration. After our government examines and approves foreign personnel, it will issue licenses, stipulate the number of people, and restrict the replacement of foreign pilots after death or resignation. Then, in one or two decades, foreign pilots in our country can be completely eliminated, sovereignty can be recovered, and national defense can be guaranteed. Therefore, at this time of severe national crisis, when the nation is seeking to survive, we offer this one idea to the government for adoption. In addition to sending representatives to petition, we are sending another telegram, hoping that everyone will agree and assist in the process, and work together to promote its realization. National defense will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. The telegram is urgent, and we are eagerly awaiting your response. Sincerely, the Chinese Yangtze River Pilots Association.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Ministry of Industry Responds to the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, Explaining the Tung Oil Improvement Plan: Official-Merchant Cooperation Is Not Control, and Oil Merchants' Suspicions Are Self-Defeating <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in view of the inconsistent quality of my country's tung oil exports, errors in delivery, and the unpredictable fluctuations in market prices, which have caused foreign manufacturers to be wary, and the fact that various European and American countries have had good results in experimental tung tree planting in recent years, if my country does not seek to improve the production and sales of tung oil, it will gradually lose its foreign market. Therefore, it has specially joined with the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang, which produce tung oil, to organize the China Vegetable Oil Factory to implement an entire improvement plan, and invited merchants to participate in share capital and cooperate earnestly. The detailed methods have been repeatedly recorded in various newspapers. It is now learned from relevant sources that Hankou oil merchants are deeply suspicious of this plan. Those who do not understand the government's intentions even believe that it is a trade control, and they are shocked to inform each other. The oil merchants petitioned the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce to present to the Ministry of Industry, requesting an explanation of the provisions of Article 4 of the organizational outline of the Vegetable Oil Factory. It is now learned that the Ministry has replied to the Hankou Market Chamber of Commerce on the 2nd of this month. The original telegram is as follows: "Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, viewed. The Ministry, together with the provinces of Sichuan, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, etc., established the Vegetable Oil Factory for the purpose of improving the quality of tung oil and standardizing product standards. The improvement method is to cooperate with oil merchants to organize a company jointly run by officials and merchants. It does not restrict the freedom to buy and sell tung oil, nor does it contain the meaning of government control. Outsiders who do not understand the truth have actually misinterpreted the sale of tung oil, which is inconsistent with the facts. Tung oil is an important product of our country, a major export, and the oil-producing area is very wide. In order to seek national unity and solidarity, we specially initiated the establishment of this factory, promoted by the government, and not to exclude oil merchants and monopolize sales by the government. As for the original Article 4 of the regulations, which stipulates that no other oil factories with the same operation may exist, it is only for the sake of future standardization. Oil merchants in the city have no reason to be suspicious. Now the preparatory office of the factory has been established. How the original oil merchants can participate in cooperation can be discussed at length. Please instruct them to negotiate with the preparatory office of the factory and do not listen to rumors and cause misunderstandings. Ministry of Industry, winter seal." According to the spokesperson of the preparatory committee of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the benefits of Chinese merchants participating in the factory plan are as follows: 1. The factory will first inspect the oil quality of the crude oil it receives. Inferior quality will be rejected, and superior quality will be rewarded, which can prevent counterfeiting and improve quality. 2. With centralized processing, the quality can be completely standardized, establishing credit abroad, and the trade status will gradually be consolidated. 3. At present, Chinese merchants have very few oil pool equipment, and acting as an agent for storage and refining can facilitate large and small oil merchants in the interior. 4. When crude oil is delivered to the factory, the factory will issue "inventory certificates" at any time. Oil merchants can use this certificate to make deposits or remittances to banks and money shops, and obtain low-interest funds from banks, which can relieve the pain of high-interest loans for Chinese merchants. 5. Spot transactions can be based on net oil as the standard, and the quality and delivery date are guaranteed. 6. Centralized insurance declarations, etc., can reduce the costs. 7. Issuing certificates can prevent internal fraud and establish external credit. 8. Centralized storage can count the quantity, and transactions and operations can be grasped, and market prices may gradually stabilize. 9. Refining before storage will prevent the formation of dregs. 10. Storing in new-style oil pools will avoid oil loss, and merchants can wait for prices to sell. 11. Selling tung oil to exporters can avoid the trouble of inspecting oil dregs, and the costs can be reduced. 12. The transportation of crude oil involves large quantities and heavy charges (such as freight, tariffs, insurance, etc.), while net oil is more economical. It is also said that the factory's recruitment prospectus has been established and is attached as follows:</p>
<p>China Vegetable Oil Factory Co., Ltd. Prospectus Tung oil is a special product of my country and a major export. In order to improve quality and improve management, we have initiated the organization of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, specializing in the agency storage and refining of tung oil and facilitating transportation and sales as the main business. In addition to drafting regulations and submitting them to the 622nd meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval, a recruitment prospectus is specially formulated as follows: 1. The factory is organized as a joint-stock limited company, jointly run by officials and merchants. 2. Official shares of the factory will be separately allocated by the Ministry of Industry and the provinces of Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, etc. 3. The company's headquarters will be located in Shanghai as the general office, and factories will be established in the tung oil producing areas in turn. 4. The total capital is 2 million yuan, divided into 20,000 shares, each share being 100 yuan. Half of the payment will be collected first. 5. In addition to the official shares being determined to be half, in order to promote cooperation between officials and the people and to popularize the interests of all sectors, 10,000 shares are specially reserved for raising merchant shares. 6. The stock is registered and divided into four types: five shares, ten shares, fifty shares, and one hundred shares. 7. Stockholders are limited to those with Republic of China nationality. 8. Commercial shares receive an official interest of 8%, and official shares receive an official interest of 6%. If the settlement surplus is insufficient for commercial shares to receive official interest, the Ministry of Industry will pay 6% interest or make up the difference according to 6%. 9. Shareholders with 60 or more commercial shares are eligible to be elected as directors. With the approval of the Executive Yuan transferred by the Ministry of Industry, no other organizations with the same business are allowed to exist in the country regarding the storage, refining, and pressing of tung oil. The temporary preparatory office of the factory is located in the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry in Shanghai, and preparatory branch offices are established in the construction halls of the four provinces of Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan to handle all preparatory matters. If there are any contact matters, you can send a letter or consult with each office separately. Subscribers should fill in the subscription form, pay the stock payment according to the shares, and obtain a formal receipt. The deadline for raising shares, receiving payments, and the deadline date will be published in the newspaper. All items not specified in this prospectus shall be handled in accordance with the company's articles of association.

<p>According to Da Gong She, Shanghai Textile Printing &amp; Dyeing Co., located at 1382 Huade Road, Pudong, found in the middle of last week that some female workers in the textile department, under the pretext of poor treatment, attempted to jointly strike. After investigation by the factory, more than 20 female workers who were the leaders were dismissed. After being laid off, the female workers had difficulties making a living and often pestered the factory. Yesterday morning at 6 o'clock, more than 300 female workers in the textile department of the factory went on a go-slow to show their support for the dismissed workers. The factory could not persuade them, so they called the Yulin Road police station in the jurisdiction and sent more than 60 police cars and detectives to suppress them. At about 7 o'clock, after further persuasion from the factory, all of them resumed work as usual.</p>

<p>The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee on Renji Road, considering that the disaster areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Shandong are in a critical state of food shortage and widespread suffering, allocated 100,000 yuan to the branch associations in the areas to carry out both emergency relief and rehabilitation, in addition to monitoring everything by local Chinese and Western personnel, and specially sent two commissioners, Yu and Zheng, to various places to seriously inspect the situation, which was recorded in previous reports. The association has received a report from Commissioner Yu, stating that the Xuyi County branch of the relief committee has completed the inspection and receipt of complaints in the first district, Xinyi, and other eight villages, and has provided relief to 1,179 households, with 5,895 people of all ages, issuing national currency of 2,927 yuan. Following this, the Tushan branch of Pizhou County, its fourth district, including Qixin, a total of 30 guarantors, has 1,833 households receiving relief, with 8,952 people of all ages. Relief tickets are divided into 1 yuan, 2 yuan, and 3 yuan, with a total amount of 2,935 yuan issued. There is still a lot of accumulated water along the way, and the places that have not receded are still numerous. Wheat seedlings were sown too late, or there are harvests, but they are very limited. Sorghum and pearl millet were severely damaged by soil insects, adding disaster upon disaster. The situation is extremely tragic, etc. Commissioner Zheng reported that he has completed the inspection of Jining (Shandong) and arrived in Jiaxiang County. The emergency relief has been inspected and completed, totaling 50 villages, and 4,250 yuan of relief funds have been issued. The county suffered the most severe disaster because the Yellow River breached its banks last autumn, flooding western Shandong. The Yellow River from Ju and Wen counties to the east flowed through this county into Nanyang Lake, so it suffered the most damage. The disaster area is about 30 li from east to west and 70 li from north to south, with about 5,000 hectares of flooded fields and more than 300 villages flooded, affecting more than 140,000 victims. Houses collapsed, and property losses amounted to about 2.5 million yuan. Witnessing the villages, most of the autumn wheat was not planted, and the victims are filling their stomachs with tree leaves and grass roots, which is extremely tragic, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Zhou Yisu Declares His Withdrawal from the Production Party <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the young man Zhou Yisu, realizing that the Production Party is deceiving the public and intends to disrupt national security, resolutely declared his withdrawal and issued a declaration of withdrawal from the Production Party, stating that the Chinese nation is currently facing an unprecedented crisis, but we look forward to the future of China and will never fall into a pessimistic and desperate situation. Because we have a glorious and brilliant history of five thousand years and a population of 455 million, such a large country known for its culture is by no means comparable to the small country of Abyssinia. Since the Opium War, China has repeatedly been on the verge of danger due to foreign aggression, but it has always been able to turn danger into safety, and the national destiny has continued until now, still standing on the East Asian continent. This is no accident. At the end of the late Qing Dynasty, the monarch was weak and the ministers were dark, and internal affairs were not cultivated, which led to foreign powers taking advantage of the situation. The national vitality was on the verge of extinction. However, although foreign enemies were strong, even during the corrupt days of the abdicated Qing Dynasty, they could not destroy China. Moreover, today, official governance is enlightened, the national foundation is solid, and construction is advancing rapidly. Our Chairman Chiang is in sole charge, directing decisively. Domestic banditry is on the decline, and civil wars are gradually being quelled. Pacifying the interior is the way to resist foreign aggression. Recuperation and education, lying on firewood and tasting gall, sincere unity, and the essence of striving are the times. Is there any reason for China to perish? "To resist the enemy and avoid regretting, we must first have a correct assessment, and to restore the nation, we must also have a necessary process. Let us ask, based on the current situation in our country, how can we compare with other countries in terms of national strength, financial resources, or military strength? At this time, if there is no sufficient and solid preparation, and a unanimous determination from top to bottom, to rashly fight is like throwing an egg against a stone. As for the work of national restoration, it must go through at least three stages. First, we must restore our country's inherent morality and culture, promote national essence, encourage integrity, and reject foreign hand-shrinking class struggle and various evils, so that 400 million people will be of one mind and have the same national thoughts and consciousness. Then the national spirit can surge and be unstoppable. Second, we must improve our country's production and construction. The reason for our country's weakness is the backwardness of industry, the failure of industry and commerce, the lack of developed transportation, and the inability to exploit mining. At present, to save weakness and seek strength, we can only actively engage in material construction, revitalize national industry, build railways and highways, develop underground treasures, and work hard to transform our country into a modern country. Food and clothing before soldiers, national wealth before national strength, ancient teachings are obvious, and improving production and construction is the most basic work of national rejuvenation. Third, we must promote military national education. Now all countries in the world are talking about military affairs and expanding armaments. Standing in the 20th century today, we feel terrified and fearful. To defend against aggression and strive for strength, we can only increase armaments and promote military national education, so that everyone has a martial spirit and a healthy body. With one heart and one mind, we will be able to wash away national humiliation and turn weakness into strength in the blink of an eye. From the above, it can be seen that without sufficient preparation and the mobilization of the entire nation, we must never engage in resistance to the enemy and resisting humiliation. Otherwise, we will take the nation as a sacrifice and put the country in a state of eternal destruction. As for the work of national revival, it cannot be accomplished overnight. It must go through a preparatory stage and a long-term recuperation and education work. It must also be under the firm and unwavering leadership of the wise and responsible authorities to lay a safe cornerstone. Now, some frustrated bureaucrats, politicians, and reactionaries often criticize the government authorities on the issue of resistance to the enemy. It is either unfounded or intended to undermine the prestige of the government and divide the united front of the entire nation. All reactionary groups, such as the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Third Party, are now spreading their tongues and trumpeting the claim of "resistance to aggression and saving the country." Little do they know that the Labor Party uses the theory of class struggle to advocate national revolution, which cannot cover up its deceptive effect. The red lackeys of the Social Democratic Party and the Third Party, etc., are acting as accomplices for the party and reversing black and white, which are also moths that obstruct the national revolution. Only by standing firmly under the leadership of the central responsible authorities can we shoulder this arduous task of restoring the nation, saving the country, and seeking survival. Only by trusting the current government's foreign policy and the supreme leader's effective measures for the political situation can we save the country's misfortune. I have withdrawn from the "National Revolutionary Alliance" because I do not want to be a tool for some frustrated warlords and bureaucrats, helping the wicked to do evil. Now I have become a sincere supporter of the current government, because I have confirmed that the policies implemented by the current government have indeed entered an important stage of national revival. Saving the country does not advocate empty talk. Today, the government is immersed in construction, and the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall has laid the foundation for a century-long plan for saving the country and seeking survival. I hope that the revolutionary youth of the country will unite under the leadership of the government and move forward.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented the new regulations, users from all walks of life have successively removed their phones and refused to pay the phone bill due to inaccurate metering, and reported the company's errors to the Special Zone Telephone Problem Committee. Yesterday, the Jialu Shoe Store on Zhejiang Road did not pay its bill because the company's metering was inaccurate, averaging four times a day, but the company actually counted nine times. When asked the company, no reason was given, and the phone bill was demanded. In addition, the Xuyongtai Hotel on Avenue Edward VII also complained because the company overcounted 50 times. The Central Electric Company on Henan Road also requested negotiations with the Telephone Problem Committee because the company's metering was inaccurate. The First Special Zone Citizens' Federation received letters from citizens in various districts, saying that the telephone new regulations have been implemented for three months, with more disadvantages than advantages. It was previously negotiated to try it out for three months. Now that the three-month period has passed, the federation is requested to negotiate to restore the old regulations. Therefore, the federation decided to propose a discussion on countermeasures at the Second Representative Assembly on the 6th of this month.</p>

<p>The French Consulate in Shanghai recently issued Decree No. 122, stipulating that the coffin of a person who dies in the French Concession must be moved out within seven days. If they wish to stay at home, they must apply to the Health Bureau for a permit. The permit fee is five yuan per sheet for seven to fifteen days, and ten yuan per sheet for fifteen to thirty days. Those who do not move out after the deadline and apply to keep the coffin will be charged five yuan from the first to the fifteenth day and ten yuan from the fifteenth to the thirtieth day.</p>
<h3 id="e136">French Concession Taxpayers' Association Negotiates the Abolition of the Sanitation Fee; The License of Tongxing Fuguanqi Store Was Taken Away; Sends a Letter to the Taxpayers' Association to Protest to the French Municipal Council <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association recently received a letter from the Second District Branch of the Citizens' Federation, stating that Wu Futian, the owner of Tongxing Fuguanqi Store at No. 484 Fahua Min Road, reported that on May 28, the French Municipal Council suddenly sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to his residence and shop, saying that there were also Fuguanqi objects in the residence and that he must also pay a sanitation license fee and investigate. He was very surprised to hear this. Since the objects in his shop were not related to hygiene, paying the sanitation fee was already beyond reason, but he had been paying it painfully until now. How could there be additional complications? It is normal for the remaining objects in the shop to be placed in the residence. If he is forced to pay for a license, it is extremely unreasonable. Therefore, he was unwilling to pay, but the detectives used strong-arm tactics and forcibly took away the original license of his shop and copied the door number back to the police station, and then threatened to issue a fine. The detectives are so rampant and unscrupulous that I am afraid that he is not the only merchant who has been harmed. Therefore, he has no choice but to ask the association to help him and forward his protest to the French Municipal Council to strictly negotiate and abolish this harsh tax as soon as possible to avoid disturbances. According to this, it is appropriate to convey it and hope that he will propose a negotiation. After receiving the letter, the association has sent personnel to investigate and verified the facts and has submitted a negotiation to the French Municipal Council.</p>

<p>The Jinxing Hat Factory at No. 260 Luxiangyuan Road, Ji畝地, is opened by Jiang Xiaoliang and others from Funing. It employs more than 20 straw and woolen hat workers. Recently, the workers took the opportunity to demand that the company increase wages, but failed. On the 18th of last month, thugs instigated by the workers destroyed all the machinery in the factory. The factory reported this to the Laobeimen Police Station and the Public Security Bureau for arrest and investigation. The factory then set up a branch factory in the concession. Unexpectedly, yesterday at 0:05 PM, thugs Yan Wenzhang, 28 years old from Ningbo, and workers Guo Xiuting, 28 years old from Zhenjiang, Yue Mingfa, 21 years old, Li Longqing, 23 years old, and other workers, swarmed into the factory, forcibly demanding wages without success and destroying equipment. The factory immediately reported to the police station. Chief Shen immediately sent Officer Hu to lead the police to rush to the scene and arrest four thugs, Yan Guo and others. While they were being interrogated, the factory workers reported to the union at about 7 PM last night that they had gathered two or three hundred workers and rushed to the Laobeimen Police Station, demanding the release of Yan Guo and others. Chief Shen immediately replied to the workers that if it was a union, they could prepare an official letter to the police station to apply for bail for verification. Unexpectedly, the workers refused to provide a letter and unreasonably caused trouble, and the momentum was fierce. Chief Shen immediately supervised all the officers and police to disperse the workers and immediately sent the four criminals, Yan Guo, Yue Li, to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the Shanghai-Beijing through train, passengers have found it convenient. However, due to the long distance and the 48-hour travel time, the Ministry of Railways has set up sleeper berths in the first and second-class cars to allow passengers to sleep, but the third-class cars are lacking. It is now learned that in order to provide third-class passengers with sleeping opportunities, the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Beining Railways have consulted and decided to set up sleeper berths in third-class cars. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, third-class cars will have upper, middle, and lower berths. The upper and middle berths will cost one yuan per night, and the lower berth will cost one yuan and fifty cents. It is currently being actively prepared and will be implemented next month.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Public Concession Authorities Strive to Improve Traffic; Revise Traffic Regulations; Restrict Vehicle Parking <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Regarding restricting vehicles from parking on the roadside to reduce street congestion, in April last year, the Chief of the Police Department of the Public Works Bureau suggested to the Board of Directors that the parking of vehicles on congested streets should be further restricted. The Board of Directors approved this in principle and planned to implement it at any time after nine months with a sixty-day notice. The names of the congested streets and the daytime restrictions could be increased and modified as needed. At that time, the streets and times of implementation were announced. Later, the Chief of the Police Department took advantage of a long vacation to return to his country to investigate foreign traffic management methods for reference. When the Chief returned to Shanghai after his vacation, he submitted a second report to the Board of Directors. According to his observations abroad, the source of traffic congestion in the city lies in the unrestricted parking of vehicles on narrower streets. Even in the Public Concession, the streets are gradually widening, and traffic should not be hindered. However, the arbitrary and long-term parking of vehicles has created a situation of street congestion. This situation is particularly obvious in the central district. Therefore, according to the opinion of the Chief of the Police Department, to rectify street traffic, it is necessary to start with banning parking, and this matter should not be delayed any longer. Otherwise, procrastination will gradually become unmanageable. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau recently decided to revise the traffic regulations based on the following principles: The existence of streets is to ensure smooth traffic. The parking of vehicles should be in permitted locations, that is, locations designated by the police authorities as not hindering free traffic. Vehicles should be allowed to park temporarily, except in "no parking" locations that obstruct traffic or are specially prohibited. In any part of a street, parking is not allowed if it obstructs the free flow of vehicles. In accordance with the practices of other cities, all locations where vehicles can be parked will be marked, and the current "no parking" signs will be abolished. In addition, vehicles may park temporarily, except in locations where "no parking" signs are erected and in locations where parking is specially prohibited. The parking time in the central downtown area is limited to one hour, but in certain locations, it will be shortened as appropriate. In streets that are not specifically marked, the parking time may be slightly extended within the scope of not hindering traffic. The names of streets where parking is allowed for one hour may be increased as appropriate in the future. The streets with parking restrictions have been published in yesterday's English gazette of the Public Works Bureau. In addition, the traffic routes at the Bund and Yangjingbang are currently very chaotic and will be improved in the future. The Deputy Director of the Public Works Department has drafted a plan and will implement it soon. In addition, the Suzhou Road riverbank can be developed into a number of parking spaces, but the work will not be carried out until the restrictions are not severe. It is said that the above-mentioned vehicle restriction measures will be implemented three months later, that is, starting from September 5.</p>

<p>Xu Wancheng, editor of the Longwen Bookstore in Dananmen, recently published "Xu Wancheng's Work Report." The day before yesterday, he again used half a page of the Min Bao newspaper to publish a special issue, which included a solicitation for articles investigating the dark side of the Chinese judiciary, attacking the local court for stealing twenty pistols from the lost and found warehouse, and severely criticizing the court president. It also alleged that court clerks openly extorted money, and that Judge Zhao and others accepted bribes, etc. The article also stated that judicial officials who violated their duties should be punished with beheading, which aroused the pursuit of Judge Zhao Yongzhou and Zhao Yuesheng in the court. They requested the prosecutor to investigate and handle the matter. Xu was not present at the time. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Xu Wancheng boldly went to the court and demanded an immediate trial to adhere to the schedule. After questioning by Prosecutor Tang, he was ordered to return. At that time, inquiries were made about the circumstances of Xu Wancheng's interrogation. It was said that the prosecutor asked him where the allegations of bribery against Judge Zhao and others came from, and Xu replied that they were all copied from other newspapers, so he was not responsible. Therefore, the prosecutor ordered the original newspaper to be submitted for review.</p>

<p>Liu Yecai, from Hefei, Anhui, was 25 years old and worked as a watchman at the vagrant labor camp in Caohéjing, west of Shanghai. He was usually quite conscientious. Yesterday morning around 4 a.m., Liu was inspecting the dormitory of the vagrants alone when six vagrants from a certain dormitory, who had long premeditated and conspired to escape, lured Liu into the room with words. The six then acted together, first tightly binding Liu with a single blanket, and then beating him severely with iron bars. Liu immediately passed out. After the incident was discovered, three of the six perpetrators had already fled. The authorities of the camp were notified and immediately sent Liu to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment in an ambulance. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died in the hospital at 1 p.m. The hospital notified the camp, which reported to the Shanghai Local Court.

<p>Zhou Shaoqing, a 63-year-old villager from the Sixth Bao, Third Jia, Zhou Family Residence in Sanlintang, Pudong, Shanghai County, whose son had passed away, left behind a grandson named Zhou Baifu, 19 years old. Zhou Baifu had lost his parents at the age of six and was raised by his grandparents. In November two years ago, he married Zhou Zhou, the daughter of Zhou Xuegen, a vegetable seller living at 139 Lu Xue Residence, Xicaohedu, in this city. Later, his grandmother also died, so the household consisted of his grandfather, his grandson, and his granddaughter-in-law. Because Zhou Baifu was the only grandson, Zhou Shaoqing loved him dearly. Moreover, Zhou Shaoqing's family had 17 mu of good land and four and a half rooms, which was considered a well-to-do family among the rural farmers. Therefore, Zhou Baifu had been accustomed to eating and spending extravagantly since childhood, and associated with villains and ruffians, indulging in gambling and wandering aimlessly. As a result, his wife, Zhou Zhou, could not bear it and returned to her mother's home to work and support herself. Zhou Baifu became even more lawless and demanded money from his grandfather every day to spend. The day before yesterday, he beat his grandfather for not getting money. He struck his grandfather's left temple with a palm, causing immediate death. After committing the crime, Baifu fled to his wife's house. His wife rebuked him for not serving his grandfather and abandoning her to come to Shanghai. Baifu could not answer. While they were questioning him, someone from the village arrived and explained the matter. Zhou Zhou immediately had her father watch over Baifu and went back to the village to inquire. She was arrested by the County Public Security Bureau, and she explained that her husband was at her father's house. The police were dispatched to arrest Baifu. Yesterday, he was transferred to the Local Court. Prosecutor Li Fen, accompanied by Inspector Shen, arrived at the scene of the injury and confirmed that the death was indeed caused by the injury. They ordered the family to collect the body and await legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Cantonese performer Zheng Mengxia and her husband Chen Gaocong, who previously performed at the Tianchan Stage, did not pay the wages of the hired musician Xia Fubao, which amounted to seventy dollars. Nor did they compensate for the seventeen dollars and fifty cents for Xia's raincoat being torn by their dog, one dollar for a Yunfei taxi fare, and two dimes for fried rice. Xia filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, requesting mediation. Because the Zheng and Chen couple did not appear, it was announced that mediation had failed. This matter has been reported in previous newspapers. The plaintiff, Xia Fubao, has now paid the litigation fees and formally filed a lawsuit. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., Judge Guo Wei of the Second Special Court presided over the hearing in the Fourth Civil Court. The defendants still did not appear. The plaintiff, Xia Fubao, appeared in court and stated the previous circumstances, requesting that the defendants be ordered to repay the amount in full.

<p>The Zhoujiaqiao Police Station in the western part of Shanghai has recently been very serious about cracking down on drugs. Patrol Officer Wei Jiechen was patrolling in the Zhoujiaqiao area yesterday afternoon when he saw a local man, Gu Sandi, whose face had the appearance of smoking opium and whose actions were very flustered. He immediately stepped forward to check and found three packs of morphine in Gu's felt hat. He took Gu to the station and transferred him to the Caohedu Public Security Bureau for questioning. Gu confessed that the morphine was purchased from Yang Wang, a native of Wuxi, at No. 7 Shenjialang, Zhoujiaqiao. According to his confession, the bureau immediately sent a senior police officer to arrest Yang Wang and bring her to the bureau. The bureau, considering the case involved selling and smoking morphine, sent both criminals to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Heroin Trafficking Operation Cracked on Danshui Road, Undercover Detectives Posing as Customers, Confiscating More Than Twenty-Five Ounces of Heroin, Police Observe Not Within the Means of Chinese Nationals <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Detectives Yang Zhaoqing, Wang Rulin, Guo Ruiquan, and others from the Anti-Narcotics Department of the General Patrol Room recently cracked a heroin trafficking operation at No. 11 Lishui Lane, No. 24 Danshui Road, and arrested Cao Yunyou from Taizhou, Wang Ziru from Haimen, Wang Bao, a woman from Suzhou, and Wang Qingyi from Taizhou, and confiscated 25 taels of heroin, plus a small packet, a ledger, and a scale, all of which were taken to Chengdu Road Patrol Room and detained separately. Yesterday morning, charges were filed in accordance with Article 257, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for the crime of trafficking in heroin. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the patrol room stated that after the Anti-Narcotics Department learned that someone was selling drugs at No. 11 Lishui Lane, Danshui Road, Detective Wang Rulin of No. 17 disguised himself as a customer and contacted Cao Yunyou, saying that he was from Qingpu and needed to buy some heroin. Cao then gave him a small packet of samples and agreed on a price of 25 yuan per tael, but he would not sell in small quantities, with a minimum of 25 taels, totaling 625 yuan in national currency, and agreed to exchange the money and goods at 2 p.m. Detective Wang reported back to Western Detective Chief and requested the court to issue a search warrant and cooperate with other detectives to wait around Cao's house. On the one hand, Detective Wang still entered the house, and Cao sent his uncle Wang Ziru out. Half an hour later, he came with Wang Qingyi and met with Detective Wang. Wang Qingyi again sent Wang Ziru out. At 3:40 p.m., he returned with a woman, Wang Bao, who was holding a box of Great Britain brand cigarette paper, containing 25 taels of heroin. Cao immediately asked Detective Wang to hand over 625 yuan in cash. Detective Wang, wanting to test whether the paper bag contained genuine goods, took a glass of water, and Wang Bao used a needle to pierce it, extracted a little, and poured it into the water. At that time, Chinese and Western detectives rushed in to arrest them. The patrol room found that No. 11 Lishui Lane was only a liaison office. If there were customers, they would go out to pick it up. And they observed that the heroin's paper packaging was tight and sealed with lead, which was not within the means of Chinese nationals. Therefore, they requested an extension in order to investigate the source of the drugs. Cao Yunyou confessed that the heroin was brought by Wang Bao, Wang Ziru was his wife's younger brother, and Wang Qingyi lived at No. 22 Liji Lane, Zilaishui Street, French Concession, and came to my place to play yesterday. Wang Ziru confessed that his brother-in-law instructed him to call Wang Qingyi. He happened to meet him on the road. Wang Bao was Wang Qingyi's concubine. He did not know the value of the heroin Wang brought. Wang Bao confessed that she had known Wang Qingyi before and was now a prostitute at Rui Xiang Yuan in the French Concession (stage name Hua Yuanyuan Lao Si). Yesterday, she met Wang Ziru on the road and saw him holding a paper box. Because Wang owed me 10 yuan in French currency, I asked for it. Wang then instructed me to go home with him to get it, and when I got to the door, he handed me the paper box to hold temporarily, not knowing it was drugs, etc. Wang Qingyi's confession was evasive, saying that he came to Shanghai from Taizhou to find Cao Yunyou for only two days and knew nothing about the rest. Judge Huang Risheng verified the confessions and ordered the four defendants to be detained pending a further hearing on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Chen Zun'gui and Yu Qingsong Went to Japan Last Night to Observe the Solar Eclipse, Chen Discussed the Image of the Total Solar Eclipse in Detail, the Sun Was Obscured and the Day Suddenly Turned into Night <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The big event in the astronomical world this year is the total solar eclipse on June 19. The Astronomical Research Institute of the Central Research Institute of our country also sent special personnel to observe it in Boli, the Soviet Union, and Hokkaido, Japan. Observers Zhang Yuche and Li Yan, who went to Boli, had already set off for the Soviet Union a few days ago. Chen Zun'gui and Yu Qingsong, two solar eclipse observers who went to Hokkaido, Japan, came to Shanghai yesterday morning and took the Japanese mail ship Chichibu Maru to Japan at 12 o'clock that night. A reporter from Shenshi News Agency made a special visit to the hotel yesterday to interview them, and the following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>Meaning, Location, and Process of the Solar Eclipse</p>
<p>Chen first described the significance of a total solar eclipse, saying that the earth revolves around the sun once a year, and the moon revolves around the earth once a month. The two rotate continuously, year after year. It takes about 400 years to discover a total solar eclipse at a fixed location. The locations through which this year's total solar eclipse passes begin in the Caspian Sea in Europe, then pass through Siberia, Chita, and other places in the Soviet Union, to Qigan and Huma in Heilongjiang, China, then to Boli in the Soviet Union, and Hokkaido, Japan, and finally into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The Earth is Dark During a Total Solar Eclipse</p>
<p>Around 3 p.m. this month, all of Mari, Boli, and Hokkaido are locations through which the total solar eclipse passes. The total solar eclipse lasts only one minute and fifty-seven seconds. At this time, the sun, moon, and earth are in perfect alignment. The bright sun hanging high in the sky is suddenly obscured by the moon, and the earth immediately becomes dark, as if it were a full moon night. The twinkling stars are terrified and the birds and animals roar. We look up at the sky again and see the black shadow of the moon obscuring the sun, with the light of the lunar corona shooting out around the moon. This phenomenon lasts for one minute and fifty-seven seconds, after which the moon gradually moves past the obscured sun and returns to its original state.</p>
<p>Observe the Partial Solar Eclipse with Blackened Glass</p>
<p>There are three types of solar eclipses. A total solar eclipse is when the sun is completely obscured by the moon, a partial solar eclipse is when only a part is obscured, and an annular solar eclipse is when the center of the sun is obscured. Around 3 p.m. on June 19, locations not in the path of the total solar eclipse, such as Shanghai and Nanjing, can see the image of a partial solar eclipse by covering the eyes with glass lightly coated with black ink to observe the sun.</p>
<p>The Mission of Observing the Total Solar Eclipse</p>
<p>Chen continued, that this total solar eclipse is highly valued by countries all over the world. Astronomers from various countries have gathered in Boli in the Soviet Union and Hokkaido in Japan. The mission of observing the total solar eclipse is to study the shape of the total solar eclipse and take photographs. The other is to visit the instruments used by various countries to observe the total solar eclipse and how Japan treats inspectors from various countries, so as to learn from it for the total solar eclipse in our country in 1941.</p>
<p>Prediction of the Total Solar Eclipse in Our Country</p>
<p>The total solar eclipse in our country was discovered once in 1542 (the 21st year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty). After about 400 years, a total solar eclipse will be discovered again in 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China). The area through which it passes starts from Xinjiang, passes through Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, and reaches the Fujian-Zhejiang border, and enters the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Observation Specialist Departed for Japan Last Night</p>
<p>Chen concluded that our country's observation team to Japan consists of three people. Yu Qingsong and I are carrying more than ten pieces of observation equipment, such as telescopes, chronometers, and movie cameras. We came to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of the 3rd, and took the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru to Japan on the night of the 4th. We should arrive in Hokkaido around the 11th. There is also a student studying in Japan. After observing the total solar eclipse on the 16th, we will visit observatories in Tokyo and other places, and we will be able to return to China by the end of this month.</p>

<p>Two Boys Sleeping Together Under a Quilt, Investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang of the China Women and Children Relief Association, together with detectives Wang Haiquan, Qu Heqi, Xu Juelu, and others from the Customs Water Police Station, went to the Taiyuan ship of the Taikoo Company's Nanyang line at the Bund in the French Concession to investigate at around 4 a.m. yesterday. They found two boys sleeping together under a quilt in the steerage, guarded by two women, one old and one young. When asked about the relationship between the two women and the two children, the old woman said that she was from Chaozhou, and the young woman was her niece-in-law. The five-year-old child, named Xiaodidi, was her young grandson. The young woman also said that she was from Chaozhou, and the six-year-old boy, named Xinfu, was her own son. The detectives woke up the two children for questioning. The five-year-old child spoke with a Suzhou accent, and the six-year-old child spoke with a Changzhou accent, which was obviously contradictory. At this time, the young woman suddenly went to the toilet to relieve herself and never returned. The old woman, along with the two suspects, was taken to the Water Police Station. The woman then confessed that her surname was He Chen, 50 years old, from Chaozhou. She admitted that the five-year-old child was bought from Hu San at 45 yuan in North Shansi Road, and the six-year-old child was also bought by her niece-in-law from Hu's family for 55 yuan. When questioned, the two children did not understand. The woman first claimed they were her grandson or nephew, but then changed her story to say they were bought. Her statements were inconsistent, and the other young woman suspiciously fled. With these two suspicious points, it was clear that she was smuggling them out of the country. The police chief ordered a continued search for accomplices and their transfer for further investigation.</p>
<p>Three Young Girls Abducted Together, Lu Xiu, a young girl from Changzhou, came to Shanghai a month ago to look for work and stayed at her brother Lu Akun's house. Recently, eleven days ago, Xiuying suddenly disappeared. Akan suspected she had been abducted, so he waited at the docks of various northern export ships every day to prevent her from being trafficked to the north. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., he went to the Yida ship dock of the Jardine Matheson Company to visit and found Xiuying in the steerage. Just as he was about to take her away, two men and four women came out to stop him and beat Akun severely. A customs officer helped to break the siege and reported it to the Customs Water Police Station. Detectives Huang Songsheng, Hu Changqing, Qu Heqi, and others rushed to arrest them. One man and one woman seized the opportunity to escape, and only one man and three women were captured, along with Akun and his sister. They were taken to the police station. Akun first explained the circumstances of his sister's abduction. Xiuying also confessed that eleven days ago, she went out to buy vegetables at her home in Hongkou and met the fugitive Bao Lin (male) and the arrested Wu Zhaodi (female), who lured her to a small inn where she was raped for eleven days. Today, Bao Lin said that he would take me to Qingdao to find business, but I didn't know I was going to be trafficked. The arrested male defendant confessed that his false name was He Rongxiu, his real name was Zhen Dalun, and he was from Shandong. He had been a police officer in Wuxi. He stammered and could not answer the rest of the questions. One female defendant, named Wu Zhaoshang, 29 years old, from Jiangbei, gave a cunning confession. When the other two women were interrogated, they both claimed that they had also been abducted. One was named Zhao Xiaomei, 19 years old, from Jiangbei. She used to work in Wuxi. Two weeks ago, Mo Chunlin, whom I knew, sent me a letter from Shanghai, inviting me to Shanghai to find a job. The next morning, he introduced me to the defendant He Ronghua, and we became lovers. I heard them discuss the word "trafficking" (commonly known as abducting women), and only then did I realize I had been deceived. Another was named Gu Damei, from Pudong. Wu Zhaodi and others persuaded me to do the business of "selling people" (prostitution), first selling me to a brothel in Qingdao, and then escaping within a week, commonly known as "running away." I am very willing to do this. The detectives told her that after being sold to a brothel, someone would watch her all day long, and even if she made a living by selling her body, her lifelong happiness would be completely ruined. Damei realized that she had been deceived by the defendants. The police chief, finding that three abducted women had been found in one case, notified the Women and Children Relief Association to send two investigators, Chen and Lin, to the case, and they were all transferred to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Woman Accused of Abusing Her Own Daughter, Her Husband Also Argues for Legal Action After Repeatedly Failing to Persuade Her <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association sent a staff member, Zhao Jian, to the Old Gate Police Station at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, reporting that Liu Ren, a Ningbo woman living at No. 428, Edward Road, was abusing her nine-year-old daughter, Liu Derong, and requested an investigation. Chinese Detective He Renrui and Western Detective Aston went to investigate and learned that Liu Ren's husband, Liu Jisheng, was a typesetter. Derong was born to Liu Ren. However, Liu Ren was violent and would beat her daughter arbitrarily for even minor mistakes. Recently, she beat her daughter with a wooden stick, tied her hands with a rope, and did not allow her to eat, causing her body to be covered with injuries and her eyes and forehead to be swollen. The situation was very tragic. They immediately arrested Liu Ren and sent the girl to Guangren Hospital for examination, which confirmed that she had been injured. Liu Ren's husband, Liu Jisheng, also said that he had repeatedly tried to persuade her without success, so he advocated legal action. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Liu Ren to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the police station explained the situation, requesting that she be punished in accordance with Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for abusing boys and girls under the age of sixteen, thereby hindering their natural development. Then Liu Derong filed a complaint, stating that she had been abused by her mother from time to time, and showed the court the swollen injuries on her arms and legs. Then Liu Jisheng, the second landlord Zhu Wenyue, the owner of the Yongli Straw Paper Shop, and the cohabitant Mo Wentao successively testified to Liu Ren's abusive behavior. When questioned, Liu Ren also admitted that she had beaten her daughter, but only to discipline her for constantly stirring up trouble. Judge Feng Shide ruled that the facts were clear and ordered the start of the debate. Police Lawyer Wang stated that the defendant's criminal behavior was very clear, but the defendant's motive was to discipline her children, but the method of discipline was too excessive. Also, the defendant had never been punished before, so he requested that a suspended sentence be announced at the time of sentencing, giving her an opportunity to rehabilitate herself. Judge Feng then ordered Liu Ren to be remanded in custody and scheduled the verdict for this Saturday.</p>

<p>Lu Zhongkui, a 38-year-old local from No. 158, Avenue Haig, French Concession, had been unemployed for a long time and was in financial difficulties. On the 18th of last month, he entrusted Xu Xu, a 33-year-old Hangzhou woman who lived with him, to introduce his own daughter, Hongbao (18 years old this year), to Hu Mao Yuan, who lived at No. 3, Tongzhi Lane, on the same road, to be an adopted daughter for 250 yuan. After making an agreement, 110 yuan was paid first, and the remaining money was agreed to be paid later. However, not long after, Xu Xu took Lu Hongbao to Han Zhuang (a brothel) opened by Lu Zhou on the same road, No. 142, to be a prostitute. The girl's father found out about it and reported to the police that Xu Xu had sold a free woman into prostitution. Detectives Zhi Xiang and Zhong Benchang arrested Xu Xu and transferred her to the Second Special Court. The lawyer of the Police Department filed a public prosecution on charges of obstructing morality. She was ordered to be detained pending a further hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanying presided over a continued hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Lu Zhongkui, recounted the previous circumstances. Then Lu Hongbao testified that on the 18th of last month, Xu Xu took me to a brothel to be a prostitute. I received a guest that night. The witness, Lu Zhou, the mistress of Han Zhuang, testified that Lu Hongbao was brought by Xu Xu to rent a room. The night's earnings were 15 yuan. After deducting the room fee of 2 yuan, the remaining 13 yuan was given to Xu Xu. She was afraid to lead her to a brothel since she was to be adopted by Yuan. The rest of the confession was evasive, and she hired Wang Shizong as her lawyer. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 8th and that the defendant be released on bail of 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The late Xu Qingyun, a native of Pudong and owner of Taichangxiang Foreign Goods Store on Avenue Edward VII, had considerable wealth during his lifetime. He passed away on November 18, 1933. Recently, Xu Daxin, the biological daughter of his late wife Xu Chen, commissioned three lawyers, Zhang Shizhao, Peng Yuanxun, and Zhang Ding, to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Xu Chen, Xu Qingyun's concubine, his brother Xu Fusheng, and his sisters Xu Xiaoxin and Xu Laibao, requesting confirmation that the divorce contract between Xu Qingyun and her mother Chen in Japan was invalid. When the agreement was signed, Daxin was not present to sign. Later, it was suddenly discovered that there was Xu Daxin's signature. The case has been heard and interrogated by two courts. Due to the incomplete number of witnesses, it was ordered that the hearing be adjourned. All the circumstances have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu continued the hearing in the Seventh Civil Court. The plaintiff, Xu Daxin, was represented by her lawyer due to illness. The defendant was also represented by her lawyer. The witness, Lawyer Zhu Honglie, testified that in November 1931, Xu Chen and Xu Daxin came to my office. According to Daxin, I opposed my parents' divorce. According to the benefits, both of which and Daxin herself were not present at the time of signing, so Zheng Yuxiu was sued in court. The case was stopped due to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident. Ren Zhennan testified that he was a former lawyer. Only Xu [Chen] was present at the time of signing. The latter part of the second clause of the contract, "never to be analyzed," was added later. Xu Chen had questioned me about it, and I told him to ask Zheng Yuxiu to negotiate. At this point in the interrogation, the court ruled that the prepared witness Lawyer Jin Yu and the plaintiff herself had not arrived, so it was ordered that the plaintiff and witness be summoned for interrogation on the morning of the 8th.</p>

<p>Zhou Hengyun, a native of Ningbo working as an accountant at the Yuantai Heng Sugar Store at No. 15 Fujian Road in the French Concession, is 35 years old this year. He married a woman surnamed Qiu from his hometown. Ms. Qiu had a younger sister, Qiu Gengli, who is 23 years old this year. Because she often visited her sister, she frequented Zhou's house. Zhou found his wife's younger sister attractive and young. Around 1933, he used every means to first seduce Gengli into a sexual relationship. Then, he persuaded his father-in-law to take her as a concubine. He rented a house at No. 2 Guifu Lane, Guangqi Road in the city, to live with her, and later moved to No. 18 Yongri Lane on the same road. Recently, Zhou suddenly changed, developing a desire for novelty and aversion to the old. Using the excuse that Gengli had not borne any children since living with him, he first frequently scolded her, then even abused and beat her, driving her out and abandoning her. Qiu Gengli, feeling that her reliance had been betrayed and unable to endure it any longer, since Zhou worked at the Yuantai Heng Sugar Store in the French Concession, hired a lawyer to file a suit with the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. She accused Zhou Hengyun of rape and abandonment, requesting that he be investigated under Articles 221 and 293 of the Criminal Law. She also filed a private suit to recover ten years of living expenses calculated at 50 yuan per month, as well as 500 yuan in cash and a set of gold jewelry worth 800 yuan, including a gold bracelet, three gold rings, and one gemstone ring, which she had been defrauded of. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, yesterday, had Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu preside over a hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Qiu Gengli, urged her lawyer to present the case. The court first asked about the plaintiff's age and origin, then instructed that the court had dispatched police to serve a summons on the defendant. It was stated that he was currently in Ningbo, not in Shanghai, and no one had received the summons. Then, the plaintiff testified about how she was forced into becoming Zhou's concubine and the process of her being abandoned. The court stated that the location of the defendant's crime of cohabitation with the plaintiff was in the Chinese territory and thus was outside its jurisdiction. It should be prosecuted in the Shanghai District Court. After the statement, the court ruled that the case was outside its jurisdiction and adjourned.</p>

Liu immediately notified her father, Baosen. Upon hearing the news, Li came to Shanghai to negotiate with Liu, suspecting that Liu had hidden his daughter. While they were negotiating, unexpectedly, last night, a local gangster named Yang Meilin came pretending to be acting on Li's behalf to demand the girl's return and extorted 80 yuan from Liu. Liu refused, leading to an argument. The local beat police heard about the matter. Considering that it involved concealing a person and extortion under false pretenses, the police took them to the bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>Shi Banghua, his nephew Songnian, Yongnian, and family, residents of Ji Bang Town, Chongming, were invaded by a large number of armed bandits on the night of May 12th last year. The bandits robbed them of 3,000 yuan in cash and fled in different directions. Subsequently, the local Public Security Bureau arrested several suspects, who confessed that Cui Wangfu, a neighbor of the Shi family from Chongming, was on the run. At 1:30 PM on the 20th of last month, Shi Banghua and his nephews encountered Cui on Beikaier Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai. They secretly informed the Yulin Road police station, which dispatched Detective Yuan Zhenxuan to arrest him. He was escorted to the Special No. 1 Court for questioning, where he denied the charges. The court ordered him to be detained and to await the Chongming County Government to send detectives to escort him back. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Ru Bao-yi from the Public Concession Bureau made a statement. Then, Cao Houtian, an official sent by the Chongming County Government, submitted an official document. Judge Jiang questioned the defendant, Wangfu, about his age and origin and approved the Chongming County Government's request for extradition.</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Meaning of the National Flag and the Public's Understanding <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>The national flag is the embodiment of the national spirit and the symbol of national personality</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in his speech on the meaning of the national flag in Chengdu last year, proclaimed to our people: "The national flag is not only the sacred symbol representing the nation, but also the place where the spirit and life of our entire nation, from our ancestors the Yellow Emperor to us and to our descendants for thousands of generations, are gathered." He also said that the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth is a symbol of the total life of our Chinese nation passed down in one continuous line from the Yellow Emperor. It is also the trust of the souls of our Republic of China, our ancestors since the Yellow Emperor, our Premier, and the revolutionary martyrs, and the gathering place of the common faith of our 400 million compatriots. Therefore, if we want to respect our ancestors and love our country, we must respect the national flag and love the national flag. When we see the national flag, it is equal to seeing our country and our ancestors, as well as the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed for the revolution from the Premier down, and we must be solemn and respectful and rise up in excitement to continue to maintain in our hands and carry forward the national life and culture of our ancestors for five thousand years, save our country, and revive our nation, so that the national flag will forever fly in the world. Therefore, if we want to respect our country, we should love our national flag. If we want to express the spirit of respecting the country and loving the country, we should start with respecting the national flag and loving the national flag. Citizens of all countries have great respect for their national flags and take great care of them. Therefore, their national concept and national consciousness are very developed, and the people of their countries are able to love, cooperate, unite, and strive together for the benefit and glory of the nation under a unified banner. Looking at our country, the general public not only does not know how to respect and love the national flag, but also does not know what the national flag is, resulting in the people of the whole country having no central faith, no unified will, and no spirit of unity. They are mostly selfish and do not know how to strive for the survival and development of the country. Therefore, if we want to save the country from its difficulties and revive the nation, we must actively cultivate the national concept and national consciousness of the people. To seek the development of the national concept and national consciousness, we must start with respecting the national flag and loving the national flag. This city is the area where national culture is most developed, and the public's understanding of the national flag is especially important to both Chinese and foreign observers. Therefore, the people of this city should have a correct understanding of the design and meaning of the national flag, especially at ordinary times, so as to fully promote the spirit of our Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e167">The Hardware Industry in Shanghai, Compiled by China Credit Information Agency <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>(A General Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 27)</p>
<p>Business and Overview - Since most hardware products are imported, operators must order from the managing foreign firms of various countries in this port. When placing orders, there are no samples, and past styles are used as the standard. This is because countries pay close attention to the standardization of goods. For example, if a product from a certain factory in a certain country is ordered, there should be no major errors if the name of the goods is clearly stated. The weight of the goods is mostly calculated in tons, or in grosses (twelve dozen), or in boxes. The market price is calculated according to the currency system of each country, so there is a risk of fluctuations in exchange rates. Freight and insurance are mostly calculated and paid by the foreign firm, or added to the value at the time of ordering. After the order arrives in port, the purchasing foreign firm submits a notification form to collect the goods. The payment of the goods is made by exchanging the bill of lading for a bank draft with a term of ten days from the arrival of the goods. The above is a general description of ordering from foreign firms. If it is a domestic product, then the factory or managing merchant mostly sends personnel to directly solicit business. As for the sales of goods, both local and out-of-town sales are equally important. Local sales mostly employ runners to negotiate transactions, while out-of-town sales are conducted by letter or telegram. Transportation costs are borne by the customer, and insurance is paid by the seller. If there is a Shanghai Customs declaration, the goods only need to be delivered to the port of loading, and the customer's customs broker will count the goods. The shipping and insurance costs do not need to be paid on behalf of the customer. However, the price of the goods is of course somewhat cheaper than those not handled by Shanghai Customs declarations. Payment of accounts is mostly at the end of the month, whether large or small, but there are also terms of ten or twenty days. Payment of out-of-town accounts is mostly made by a draft with a term of ten days from the arrival of the goods. Occasionally, accounts are cleared in three installments or once a month. If handled by Shanghai Customs declarations, payment can be collected the day after the goods are shipped. If the goods do not match the original sample, or the price is more expensive than other companies, the goods can be returned or the price can be reduced, commonly known as "cutting the price." As for bidding for business from administrative agencies and private homes, the profits are meager and funds must be advanced. The measurement of goods when selling, except for fixed amounts, is generally calculated according to the market scale, but there are also those who still use the Sima scale (i.e., the weighing scale). The annual turnover of each industry varies greatly, with some having the lowest turnover. Among them, the copper and tin industry has a large turnover because the market price of copper and tin raw materials is high, with the highest reaching over one million yuan, and the middle level being six or seven hundred thousand yuan to one million yuan. Next is the small hardware industry! Generally, from 300,000 yuan to 1.2 million yuan. The next is the large hardware industry, with large ones reaching one million yuan and medium ones four or five hundred thousand yuan. The least is the iron industry, because the value of steel is low, so its turnover is about 890,000 yuan at the highest and 230,000 yuan at the lowest. Most of the hardware stores in Shanghai are located along the street, except for the copper and tin industry. The copper and tin stores that are open to the public sell finished household copper and tin utensils such as kitchenware. (To be continued)</p>

He mentioned that various provinces and cities had submitted exhibits to the committee for display, and he hoped that all sectors would attend and provide guidance to facilitate continuous improvement.

<p>Yan Kechang, a member of the preparatory committee and head of the judging panel, shared his views with reporters yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Proposal In recent years, Chinese society has gradually paid attention to children's affairs because children are the seeds of the nation's continuous life. Whether children's education is good or bad is related to the rise and fall of the nation's future. Therefore, the government created the National Children's Year to awaken the people's attention to children's affairs. Many undertakings for the welfare of children have been held for one year. The China Art Education Society believes that children's paintings can cultivate children's temperament, inspire children's thoughts, and cultivate children's creativity, so it is recommended to hold a national children's painting exhibition. The second is to test the state of children's psychological activities and learn about their intelligence, which is the basis for the implementation of all children's education. After being passed, six related organizations and departments jointly prepared.</p>
<p>Exhibition Theme The purpose of this children's painting exhibition has two points: (1) to inspire children's artistic interest, cultivate aesthetic instincts, and give play to creative nature; (2) to study children's artistic tendencies, test imagination ability, and help improve children's education. Based on the above principles, the painting exhibition is purely for testing and research purposes, and there is absolutely no merit test and competition. The quality of the products has no honor or disgrace relationship with children's teachers and parents, so at the beginning of the collection of products, I am deeply afraid that they are still trapped in long-term habits and still strive to be strange, so I have repeatedly stated that the selected products should pay full attention to children's creations.</p>
<p>Review Opinions The exhibits from all parties are based on a province and city as a unit, and the score is used to observe the artistic tendencies of the place. By the end of the review, there were 28 units, and the amount of products was about 1,000 pieces. Although the quantity of products varies greatly, products from remote provinces and regions have participated. At the time of review, we still adhere to a consistent proposition, and those who do not meet the standards will not be accepted, and those who are not made by students will not be accepted. As a result of the review, one-third of the selected products are counted. Now, the common opinions of the reviewers are divided into two items, and several points are put forward as follows: (A) Points that meet the standards: (1) Young students and lower grades, middle-grade students are more lively and interesting. (2) A few places can still exert local characteristics. (3) Some of the products have new life education significance or national ideological performance. (B) Points that do not meet the standards: (1) The teaching methods in a few places are still outdated, and the materials are mostly imitations of popular styles. (2) There are too many copies and retouching or works instructed by adults, which lose children's pure creative nature. (3) Lack of local teaching materials.</p>
<p>Too Few Works The above points are just general observations. As for the precise opinions, they should be the results of the evaluation. However, the number of educated children in the country is more than 12.22 million. The detailed rules for collecting goods from this meeting originally stipulated that five creative works should be selected from every 100 children. It is estimated that the number of products in the country should be more than 500,000, but the number of products is less than one-tenth, which proves that the art of our country has not been popularized, and there are still a few units that have not produced any products so far, which is really beyond our expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e178">World Games: Compilation of Track and Field Results from Previous Sessions (Part 1) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>The 11th World Games will be held in Berlin, Germany, from August 1st to 16th this year. China has shown great determination this time, sending so many athletes to participate, and also sending two inspection teams to Germany for observation. This makes us extremely happy. The football team has already gone abroad in advance, and the basketball team has also undergone a long period of joint training. Track and field competitions first opened training classes in Beiping, creating many excellent records. Now the best players in the country have gathered in Shanghai and will hold national preliminary rounds at Shen Garden in the next two days. At least twelve strong players will be selected to attend the World Games. During this period, the entire sports community is paying close attention to this preliminary round. If the results of the previous World Games are sorted out and classified during this period for the country's athletes, sports experts, and the public to see, I think it will be more practical and meaningful than any timely article. Here we can see how the results of the first few World Games were, how the results of the recent World Games are, and how the world's competitive world has progressed. At the same time, we can make a self-comparison, confirm our confidence, and move forward. We are not without hope.</p>
<p>The World Games are held every four years. From 1896 when French expert Coupe Tin revived Greek literature to the present, it is exactly the 40th anniversary. A total of ten sessions have been held. However, in 1906, due to a special invitation from the Greek government, a special meeting was held in Greece. Many European countries did not participate. That is, the countries that participated, the players sent were not the best members of the country. Therefore, this meeting is not calculated in the number of official World Games. The 6th Congress was originally scheduled to be held in Germany in 1916. At that time, it was under the raging flames of Europe, and it did not open. In fact, the World Games have only been held nine times. The Berlin meeting this year is the tenth time, because the sixth session was not held, this should also be explained.</p>
<p>The following results regarding the track and field event section are all in feet, because a book I am based on is a report from the Canadian Olympic Committee attending the 9th World Games in the Netherlands in 1929. The track and field results of each session in this book are all in feet. I have not found any other books using "meters", so I can only base it on the Canadian report and calculate it in "feet".</p>
<p>In addition, the original English names of the winning athletes in each event in each session are deleted and not used, and all are translated according to the transliteration. Fortunately, our main purpose is to look at his results, and the name is secondary.</p>
<p>Special Issue Celebrating Teachers' Day</p>
<h3 id="e179">My Hopes for Teachers <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Teachers' Day comes around once again each year. As teachers across the nation rejoice and celebrate, I have two hopes.</p>
<p>First, I hope that teachers will pay more attention to cultivating their character. We know that a sound teaching staff not only needs to possess abundant knowledge but, especially, needs to have a complete character. Only with excellent character can they gain the faith of students and the sympathy of society. On the occasion of celebrating Teachers' Day, I hope that teachers will examine themselves more closely and strive to cultivate a teaching staff with excellent character.</p>
<p>Second, I hope that teachers will continuously pursue further studies. Because society is progressing day by day, and new knowledge is increasing day by day. If they do not continue to study, they will soon become outdated. Therefore, teachers should read more books and newspapers in their spare time and must work harder on subjects related to themselves. General knowledge should not be neglected either. If teachers can pursue further studies in this way, they can always stand at the forefront of the times.</p>
<p>Holding Teachers' Day on this day of serious national crisis has even greater significance. I hope that teachers will not only be a sound teaching staff but also become the vanguard of national revival.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Mission of Today's Teachers <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Gongsu</p>
<p>The quality of a country's education is related to the rise and fall of a country. On the one hand, it cannot be separated from the enlightenment of knowledge. On the other hand, it should pay more attention to spiritual training. The responsibility of enlightening knowledge and training the spirit lies with the teachers. Therefore, the quality of education depends on whether the teachers can fulfill their mission.</p>
<p>Today's China is in trouble. There is nothing worse. Internal worries have not been eliminated, and external insults are becoming more urgent. Crises are lurking on all sides, and the national crisis is deepening. However, the vast majority of the population is still not aware of it. Many people are ignorant and do not know the relationship between individuals and the country. They only know about personal interests and do not know about national interests. Those who would rather sacrifice national interests to preserve their personal interests are everywhere. The decline of national consciousness is so serious that it is truly worrying. However, the function of education is used to transform the people's psychology, thereby promoting national consciousness, so as to save the country from subjugation, which has also become the most urgent need today.</p>
<p>In terms of the tasks of teachers, their teaching and training work has the highest value, and the importance of training is even above teaching. Teaching means imparting knowledge and enlightening knowledge. Academics rely on it to flourish, culture relies on it to advance, and the level of the people relies on it to improve. It is extremely important for a country's future, and its importance goes without saying. Training is to shape personality and train the spirit. Its purpose is to enable trainees to develop noble character and great aspirations. Its impact is enough to change the quality of the people and change customs. Those who have talent but lack virtue often contribute less to society and the country than those who have more virtue than talent. Those who are willing to sacrifice national interests are not all incompetent. It is just that they lack virtue. Therefore, those who are responsible for education, it is better to train people who are more virtuous than talented than to train people who are more talented than virtuous.</p>
<p>Now, the teachers in the school, at this time of crisis, are serving in the education sector, which is really called "heavy responsibility and a long way to go". The results of their work are closely related to the future of the nation. Therefore, teachers who work hard in their positions are repaying society. In addition to hoping that society will recognize the importance of teachers' status and obtain job security, I also hope that all teachers should make the greatest determination, embrace the spirit of sacrifice, and devote themselves to education. Teach people with an attitude of learning without getting tired of teaching, train people with the spirit of "setting an example", and use educational methods to achieve the goal of transforming society. If they can achieve their goals, the results of their efforts can enable the project of saving the country and achieving survival to be completed as soon as possible, and the future of our nation can be expected. It is not just to create excellent young people.</p>
<h3 id="e181">City Teachers to Celebrate Teachers' Day Tomorrow <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Meeting to Be Held at Minli Middle School at 3 PM; Municipal School Teachers and Staff Have Decided to Celebrate Together</p>
<p>The Federation of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools in this city is scheduled to hold a Teachers' Day celebration ceremony at 3 PM tomorrow in the auditorium of Minli Middle School. Zhang Shouyong, Jiang Jianbai, Liu Zhanen, Tong Hangbai, Chen Jicheng, Xu Zexiang, Ma Chong, Gu Jiwu, Hu Shuyi, Wang Xiaoying, Tao Guangchuan, and others have been elected to the presidium. A special issue will be published in various local newspapers today to commemorate the occasion. Furthermore, the teachers and staff of the municipal primary schools originally planned to hold a separate meeting to celebrate, but after a preparatory meeting yesterday, it was decided to cooperate with the teachers' associations of primary and secondary schools. A grand occasion is sure to be held at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Celebrating Teachers' Day and Promoting the Literacy Education Movement <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianbai</p>
<p>So-called literacy education, also education to eliminate illiteracy, is completely for adults who have missed out on schooling. It differs from remedial education in that those who receive remedial education have attended school and need to make up for some special knowledge. Those who receive literacy education have not attended school and need to make up for general literacy and common sense guidance for civic training. Therefore, literacy education is equal to primary school education for adults.</p>
<p>China is economically backward and culturally backward, so there are especially many illiterate people. They cannot read newspapers and books, which is extremely inconvenient for anti-imperialist propaganda. Also, because they cannot read newspapers and books and have no knowledge, their worldview is narrow and they are indifferent to politics, resulting in the dispersal of national power and difficulty in concentrating it. Therefore, eliminating illiteracy and raising their cultural standards is undoubtedly very important.</p>
<p>Now, all parts of the country are working hard on literacy education and eliminating illiteracy. We, as teachers, in addition to being loyal to our own duties, should actively advocate, publicize, sponsor, and serve such literacy education work that meets the needs of the country, in order to complete the popularization of education as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e183">National Crisis Education and Teachers <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Who does not know that 1936 is a very special period? In this special period, the issue of special education has attracted the attention of people in the education sector across the country. National crisis education is not to create a special education outside the country's entire education, but to add to or subtract from the original education that has not achieved results in dealing with the national crisis for a hundred years, focusing on what is urgent so that it can fully exert the function of saving the country from the crisis. In other words, "education that consumes national power does not meet the needs of the national crisis period, and education that cultivates national power deserves to be called national crisis education." The key points of education during the national crisis have been clearly instructed by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, one is physical training, the second is spiritual training, and the third is special knowledge and skills training. Under this "national crisis education", we, as teachers, can work even harder day and night to achieve the salvation of the national crisis and the revival of the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The New Spirit That Teachers Should Have in Extraordinary Times <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Yixian</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has become increasingly serious. Now, it has reached an extraordinary period of national crisis and survival. In extraordinary times, education for extraordinary times should be carried out. How should education for extraordinary times be carried out? It is not just teaching students to read a few ordinary textbooks, nor is it just teaching people to recognize a few ordinary thousand-character lessons, but teaching them to quickly increase their ability to defend the country against the fierce attacks of enemy aircraft, artillery, and poison gas bombs.</p>
<p>Education in extraordinary times is education in which teachers lead students to practice suffering, education in which they prepare to resist wind, rain, cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the fierce attacks of enemy aircraft and artillery, and education in which they show their unity in clothing, food, housing, and transportation and go to the national crisis together. Empty talk is useless. Only hard work is right. The enemy's sea, land, and air forces have come, and 80 million square miles of territory have been lost. Everyone is responsible for the revival of the nation. Don't blame the heavens. Don't blame others. Teachers, please come in first, unite sincerely, focus on the big picture and start with the small, lead the people, lead the students, work hard, work practically, work quickly, and continue to work.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Shanghai Educational Association: A Respectful Message to All Teachers in the City on Teachers' Day <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Another year has passed, and it is once again Teachers' Day in the 25th year of the Republic. Teachers' Day was established by our colleagues in the education sector because the treatment of teachers in our country is extremely meager, to the point where individual food and clothing problems cannot be resolved, let alone the plans for supporting parents and raising children. Their lives are extremely difficult. However, the responsibilities they bear are to instill knowledge in students, cultivate the character of children, and build the foundation for national rejuvenation, strengthening the nation, and wiping out humiliation. The weight of responsibility can be said to be extreme.</p>
<p>The responsibility is so heavy, and the treatment is so meager. Therefore, our colleagues in the education sector established Teachers' Day to awaken society's attention and sympathy. On the one hand, it allows teachers to have this opportunity to gather together and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, review past achievements, reflect on past gains and losses, and decide on future directions for educational reform. Strive for self-cultivation in scholarship and morality, in order to establish an excellent example for teachers. Then the meaning of establishing this holiday can be known, and it is not just holding ceremonies. Therefore, I do not presume to be humble and respectfully offer a word to serve as a congratulatory message. I hope you will take it into consideration.</p>
<p>(1) Education is the foundation of a nation. With the widespread popularization of education, the level of knowledge of the people is high, and the love of country is strong. Countries in the East and the West strive to enrich educational funding, but our country is the opposite. Therefore, the education cause is on the verge of collapse. This kind of phenomenon relies on our teachers to find ways to remedy it. The way to remedy it is to endure hardship, actively struggle, and make educational achievements new every day, in order to arouse the faith and worship of people in society. If this is the case, then the fundraising for education funding will be easy, and the goal of popularizing education will be achieved. This is the first point to teach our colleagues.</p>
<p>(2) Han Yu said, "Teachers are the ones who impart the Tao, teach skills, and resolve doubts." It can be seen that being a teacher is not only about teaching students to read, but also about enabling students to know the way to establish themselves in the world, learn extensively, inquire carefully, think prudently, discern clearly, understand etiquette, know integrity, be responsible, and abide by discipline. Therefore, the future teaching policy must focus on imparting the Tao, teaching skills, and resolving doubts, and not just recite chapters and sentences. This is the second point to teach our colleagues.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, teachers mostly regarded teaching students to read as their best effort. Therefore, students often found themselves at a loss when they left school and entered society. Therefore, teachers should not only teach reading, but also give them opportunities for practice and self-government, cultivate the habit of diligence, the spirit of courage, the will of perseverance, the integrity of character, be quick in doing things and careful in methods, so that they can cope with ease when they enter society in the future and not have the problem of incompetence in everything. Learning is for application, so that we will not go against the purpose of education. This is the third point to teach our colleagues.</p>
<p>(4) The environment in which our country is currently located is extremely dangerous and evil, crises are everywhere, and it is a matter of life and death. The education policy should be adapted to the circumstances. Military training and military management in secondary and higher schools have profound meaning. In the future, we must inspire students' patriotic ideas, focus on military education, believe in the Three Principles of the People, obey the orders of the leader, and cultivate the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and indomitable spirit. This is the fourth point to teach our colleagues.</p>
<p>The above discussion is just a foolish idea. I hope my colleagues will encourage each other and hope that all colleagues will express great opinions and further teach them, then it will be fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Companion <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>In the evening, dragging a tired body, I returned from work. The spring sun set so early, and I felt that the noisy and cramped residence was filled with cold. But when I rang the bell, a layer of joy floated in my heart: Has Kaka Biankaf returned? My foreign neighbor whom I had known for less than half a month.</p>
<p>The landlady opened the door with a mouthful of opium smoke. Because I had paid her the rent that had been in arrears for a week yesterday, her face was a little better today, and I was a little more dignified, unlike the past few days when I was dodging like a demon with huge claws stretched out.</p>
<p>"Has the gentleman in the pavilion room on the third floor returned?" I couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Oh, that Russian devil, moved away, it was cheap for him for ten days' rent..."</p>
<p>My empty right hand rested on her thin shoulder, almost patting it hard, and I cursed in my heart: Opium addict, you are good, it's all you who made him go!</p>
<p>She paused and glared: "What's wrong, treat them the same, I can't let him live in a house without paying!"</p>
<p>"You should have told me first!" I finally blurted out, the red tide on my face receding.</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot, he left a note for you in my tobacco shop." She turned around to get it.</p>
<p>I returned to my pavilion room, too late to light the lamp, and hastily unfolded the short note Kaka left me in the dim light in front of the window.</p>
<p>On the paper was a burning heart, two eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>He apologized to me, thanked me, and wished me good health. Finally, he said he would never forget the only ray of pale friendship I had given him in the contempt and ridicule he had suffered in his exiled life.</p>
<p>Finally, he begged me to forgive his sudden escape, which was really because he was being forced too hard, and also mentioned the few times I had helped him with money, which made him feel guilty and ashamed.</p>
<p>"Maybe you will run into me on any street corner, but I will run away from you far away, so that you won't feel uncomfortable seeing me." His sentences were written very briefly, so that I could understand. He could write beautiful characters of his homeland, and like this clear and decadent wanderer, those characters were just gentle and lacked a bit of vitality.</p>
<p>I read the short note repeatedly, as if trying to find other sentences: or one day he would move back and be a warm neighbor again—we were neighbors separated by a floor, each occupying a pavilion room. He could hear my long-term coughing, and I could hear his anxious footsteps at midnight.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing else on the white paper. I only seemed to see that pair of gray, deep-set eyes gazing, and a long sigh flew out of the helpless gaze.</p>
<p>I picked up the Russian story collection that Kaka had lent me. It was full of simple little stories that could make people smile. Every night Kaka taught me to read one. He was so serious, correcting my pronunciation and explaining the grammar. When I could never roll my tongue to read a "ba" sound, he was anxiously scratching his hair. When I made the sentence smooth, he would pat me on the shoulder and say, "Very good."</p>
<p>He could also speak a little simple Shanghai dialect. I first met him in front of a small fruit shop. It was morning, and when I walked past the shop, I only heard some shop assistants laughing:</p>
<p>"Can't afford to buy, don't buy!"</p>
<p>"Poor devil, foreign ghost!"</p>
<p>Jian Kaka stood silently in front of the fruit stall, his eyes fixed on a pile of small and coarse oranges that cost one copper coin each. He groped in the pockets of his snuff-colored worn-out suit, his eyes as heavy as if they were dead.</p>
<p>Gently, he pinched out two copper coins with his left hand, dodging the ridicule of the shop assistants in the air, and carefully picked two and left.</p>
<p>Even the passers-by nearby laughed, but this strange friend walked away without turning his head, his slender, slightly hunched shadow reflected on the wall.</p>
<p>Not many days later, in the evening, when I returned from outside and walked past the door of the landlady's room, the slender figure was unexpectedly in front of me again.</p>
<p>I was stunned, and he seemed startled, then turned his head away shyly.</p>
<p>I finally heard clearly that the landlady was asking him for rent.</p>
<p>"Fu you lari," he patted his pocket and added a sentence in his own language: "Niet, niet!" (No, no!)</p>
<p>It turned out that he and I had been unknown neighbors for more than a month.</p>
<p>When he finished the negotiation, we met by the escalator. When he found out that I had also studied their language for a few months, he laughed lively and forced me to speak his language with grammatical errors.</p>
<p>We used loneliness and mutual poverty to make friendship, often telling each other about our fatigue. I always encouraged him with the enthusiasm of a young man growing in the thorny road. Sometimes he would抿抿嘴角, sometimes - especially when talking about his new motherland, he always shook his head. He said he also knew it was an unprecedented paradise, but...</p>
<p>Is it the airs of a gentleman?</p>
<p>"It always seems like it belongs to me—"</p>
<p>I refuted him with a kind smile. He allowed that one day he would拍拍掉 this old yoke and step into a new home, a new motherland.</p>
<p>But for the time being, he still ran out every two or three days to find his old companions who were more comfortable than him and get some financial assistance to live on. Occasionally, he would take out a few cents and tell me that he had earned it through work, but he didn't say how he worked, but he always passionately said to me:</p>
<p>"You work hard, work can make people forget their worries!"</p>
<p>I put down this farewell note and opened the story collection. I don't know when he had secretly written a few lines on the title page, and finally crookedly塗着 a few big characters:</p>
<p>"Kaka to Axiao."</p>
<p>These Chinese characters were what I had taught him to write under the lamp while holding his hand.</p>

<p>— Wen Ruo</p>
<p>——Sketch of a Wharf——</p>
<p>The lake, as if unable to bear the excessive loneliness, quietly danced with her light green clothes; the golden ball-like sun was about to fall on the roof of the "Yue Wang Temple." The wharf was densely packed with rows of yellow and black boats. Looking from a distance, only a few rows of irregular gray-yellow rattan chairs floated on the water, like seats in a theater, with a few dazzling white "sofas" interspersed in between, which seemed quite out of tune.</p>
<p>Under the willow tree by the bridge pier lay a large stone pier like a coffin, crowded with a pile of people. Everyone had even finished talking about the materials for chatting, and they were all silently gazing at the not-so-distant road, hoping that a few more customers would appear; only Jinqian, who had no family or burden and was still joking even when hungry, was pulling at the gray cloth cotton robe that was one piece of yellow and one piece of black, dancing alone like a stilt chicken, humming in his mouth: "Oh, Willow Green..." The voice was strangely shrill.</p>
<p>"Ugh!" Gengshui, squatting on the stone pier, raised his bark-like hand and searched his throat, pretending to be nauseous:</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, little devil! Listening to others singing makes your heart itch, listening to you sing only gives you goosebumps—wait a while and even your bones will be numb, it's not worth it if there's business!"</p>
<p>"Huh? Don't worry, there won't be any business for you to do, so listen to me sing happily!"</p>
<p>Jinqian stopped his feet and said a few words, then hopped and hummed again crookedly.</p>
<p>"Jinqian, it's a pity you have an extra thing in your crotch!" Baohe, whose forehead was engraved with "Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams"—this was the nickname given to him by his companions—said; he聳聳顋, and the wrinkles on his forehead immediately became so deep that he couldn't see the bottom. His companions all knew; he was smiling."</p>
<p>"If you didn't have that thing, I guarantee you wouldn't sing" "Willow Green Willow Red, business would definitely be good!" He continued.</p>
<p>"Jinqian, cut it off, and Baohe guarantees your business will be good!" Gengshui jumped off the stone pier and pushed Jinqian.</p>
<p>"Not a face reader, that's the truth, if Daqingniang came, business would definitely be good!" Baohe put on the old senior's airs that he was used to putting on: "Hey, Jiaxing, the boats are all rowed by women, dressed up quite nicely, with gold hairpins and gold rings—we should also try this trick, I guarantee your business will be good!"</p>
<p>Gengshui couldn't help but 　, first chuckling softly. Jinqian only tore open his mouth and歪扯着 his face, saying:</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you don't have a吤 pretty wife, even if you dress her up, she'll look like a" "Old Mother—not as pretty as me!"</p>
<p>"Haha..." Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>Behind the stone pier, on the long snake-like white dike that separated the inner and outer lakes, the crisp sound of footsteps rang out.</p>
<p>They immediately forgot the jokes just now, stood up from the stone pier nervously, and shouted with their throats stretched out:</p>
<p>"Do you want a sampan? Do you want a sampan?" A group of young foreign men and women, flaunting thin tweed coats and dancing with "sticks, walking with their chests out."</p>
<p>"Do you want a sampan? Three dimes an hour!"</p>
<p>Gengshui shouted vigorously and jumped forward, holding out three fingers.</p>
<p>But the foreigners only chatted嗞嗞咕咕, without turning their heads, and walked straight to the bus stop.</p>
<p>Gengshui had to lower his head and return to the stone pier to squat.</p>
<p>"Foreigners seem to be poor now too, foreign business is really hard to do!" Baohe cleared his throat and put on the old senior's airs again. "It's good that they only talk about hours, they don't even use cents, one dollar is always ten cents—yesterday I rowed for one customer, three hours, I agreed on ten dollars!"</p>
<p>He shook his head and twisted his buttocks, as if he was still rowing such good business now.</p>
<p>Gengshui took off his felt hat and scratched the back of his flat head, slowly saying as if he had remembered something:</p>
<p>"Such good business, only you "sofa boats" do! We—"</p>
<p>"Sofa boat?" Baohe immediately吼起来 as if he had touched a sore spot, deeply邹起 the "Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams" on his forehead:</p>
<p>"In order to install this short-lived sofa, I joined a ten-dollar club, and now I can't even pay the club fee!"</p>
<p>Gengshui glanced at him and still said enviously:</p>
<p>"It's good to have something to borrow!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Yes, long debts are still good!" All the smiles on his face disappeared, leaving only a face full of sullenness.</p>
<p>"That's it, let's talk less nonsense. It's true that you did good business yesterday, so please treat us!" Gengshui opened his mouth wide and turned the words around.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll treat you, come to my house for dinner tonight and eat good dishes!" Baohe became得意起来 again, as if saying: "After all, I, Baohe, am not bad!"</p>
<p>"There are crucian carp and snails." He added: "Eight copper coins for small crucian carp, if you think about it, add four copper coins for green onions;鋪一批 green onions, add a few fish, it's really fragrant when焖起來!"</p>
<p>"Okay, agreed!" Gengshui swallowed a big mouthful of saliva: "I'll definitely come; I won't eat your rice, we'll eat sweet potatoes tonight."</p>
<p>"I don't have a share?" Jinqian jumped in front of Baohe.</p>
<p>"I'll treat you next time!" Baohe patted his shoulder like哄孩子.</p>
<p>At this time, half of the big sun had disappeared behind the瓦背 of "Yue Wang Temple," and a片 of gloom appeared on the lake. Two slender figures slowly moved closer to the wharf from the quiet asphalt road. They could already see clearly that the one on the right was wearing a black velvet瓜皮 hat with a red顶, and the blue robe was闪着 a縷縷的光; the one on the left was wearing a tight-fitting suit, and half of the trouser leg outside the coat was stiff like paper. They immediately woke up from their dreams and jumped off the stone pier:</p>
<p>"Spin down哇?"</p>
<p>"Do you want to call a划子?"</p>
<p>Gengshui agilely rushed forward:</p>
<p>"Sir, do you want a划子?"</p>
<p>"How much旗下的?" The 反應皮帽 "Sir" asked lazily.</p>
<p>"Three dimes, okay?"</p>
<p>He shook his head and immediately accelerated his pace as if逃一般. The one wearing a suit征侧着 his head and said softly:</p>
<p>"I think we should take the bus, these guys specialize in敲竹槓, it's unethical!"</p>
<p>"Sir, how much do you want咧?" Gengshui緊緊跟 in the back: "Even if you take the bus, it will cost two角大洋, just rowing you two, and there's no回头生意. If it was before, no one would row for four角子!"</p>
<p>"Before?" The one wearing a瓜皮 hat sneered: "Now the years are not so good!"</p>
<p>"That's it, sir, how much do you say?"</p>
<p>"Two只角子, go if you go, forget it if you don't!" He said and twisted his head</p>
<p>"Okay, okay! Forget it!"</p>
<p>Gengshui发狠地跺了一脚, and ran to the tree to解缆.</p>
<p>Standing next to the suit先生, he quickly指着 a boat装西式沙发的 said:</p>
<p>"I want this one!"</p>
<p>"This is not mine," Gengshui赔着笑脸: "藤椅坐 is the same格!"</p>
<p>"Hum, the old藤椅 boat, no! No!"</p>
<p>The two位先生 left arm in arm.</p>
<p>"沙發船么? Four只角子!" Baohe's voice送过 from the石墩上. Gengshui恨恨地望着 them, and很想一度日拳打过去, but he忍住了:</p>
<p>"Sir, how is it啦,说好的"</p>
<p>"沙发船, two只角子. 就要!"</p>
<p>Gengshui牵着解下来的缆,呆呆地钉着 their背影.</p>
<p>Suddenly,宝和从石墩上来,一面用短促声音喊着: "来来, 划你去, 沙发船" The two people正在走的前面, 回头住了脚.</p>
<p>宝和连忙俯下腰去解缆.</p>
<p>根水心里一怔, "咳,连宝和都来抢我的生意!" But, he只好冷冷地说:</p>
<p>"You go?——Then what are you装啥沙发!"</p>
<p>宝和却不在意地将破呢帽略按一按, 甩起那发典的染满了汚渍的布棉袍后摆,塞在腰上,一面坐上船,一面摇头:</p>
<p>"不去?他眞不肯加的,倒反大家捞个空!"</p>
<p>根水望着那两个客人,分坐上两面的弹簧椅上,当中小圆桌上的金色茶壶在闪光,桨一下下地摇进那鱼鳞似的水里. He心裡一急, 就直着喉咙喊:</p>
<p>"旗下去哇?旗下开船哩?"</p>
<p>这时,荣生和金钱都慢慢地走过来,收起船上摆设的藤椅, 荣生一面咕噜着:</p>
<p>"一天,只划得个五十个铜板!"</p>
<p>金钱正拆下藤椅捧向家里</p>
<p>"五十个?还好!老子只三十个咧!"</p>
<p>根水没答嘴, 咛了一把鼻涕, 往油饼似的布袄上一抹, 又撕声地喊着:</p>
<p>"旗下去哇?十个铜板!"</p>
<p>从那宽阔的柏油路边转过七八个男男女女来,都是穿着布袄的乡佬, 他马上迎着</p>
<p>"要不要到旗下去?"</p>
<p>"几个铜板一个人?" The灰黄的毡帽下加了一对耳朶套的十七八岁的小伙子问.</p>
<p>"算八个垃倒哩!"</p>
<p>"八个?"扎着黑包头的中年妇人揷进来说: "人家五个!"</p>
<p>"六个!六个!"</p>
<p>"你又来咧!" 用粗粗的雨伞柄背着一个蓝布大包袱的中年男人, 狠狠地看了那女人一眼: "就是五个,五八得四十,也快要两只角子, 走走末好哩!"</p>
<p>"五个就五个,依你!"</p>
<p>根水跟上去.</p>
<p>但是,那一伙人没有一个停住脚. 声音只在灰黑色的天空和浅黄色的湖面上荡了一转, 又重新折进根水自己底耳朶里.</p>

<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>There was a fig tree,</p>
<p>Planted in a vineyard.</p>
<p>The owner came to the tree,</p>
<p>But never saw any fruit.</p>
<p>The owner scolded the gardener:</p>
<p>"Has it borne fruit in ten years?"</p>
<p>"Quickly chop it down for me!"</p>
<p>"Why let it occupy the land in vain?"</p>
<p>The gardener still deceived the owner:</p>
<p>"It's better to let it exist."</p>
<p>"Let me dig soil and fertilize it,</p>
<p>Please take another look at whether it is good or bad."</p>
<p>The owner instructed the gardener:</p>
<p>"Just do as you say for the time being. If it bears fruit, then so be it, otherwise you're fired too!"</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Crossroads of New Poetry <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Jun</p>
<p>Although this is a world of fire and blood, although this is an unadulterated "era of poetry," although everywhere we hear fervent calls for singers of the times; what is strange is that the poetry scene in recent years has been exceptionally desolate and沉寂, giving one a sense of utter desolation.</p>
<p>Why is there this phenomenon? This, of course, like the decline of the entire literary scene, has its various objective and complex factors, which are difficult to exhaust in one place; however, I have always believed that New Poetry itself contains many incorrect tendencies, in other words, New Poets have intentionally or unintentionally embarked on various dead-end detours, which should at least be one of the biggest reasons for creating this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Okay, now let's examine and criticize those incorrect tendencies, those detours.</p>
<p>I remember the great Russian critic Belinsky once saying the following: "Everyone has the right to demand that a poet, at least in his poems, should pour out his heart's sorrow for unsolvable problems. A poet who ignores the masses and only sings about himself and his own affairs will not gain a single reader besides himself." What kind of era is China currently in? What are the "pressing issues of the times"? For writers (poets) who habitually pride themselves on their sensitivity, these are of course "problems" that are not problems. That being said, what cannot but cause us the greatest surprise is that at present, China has quite a few "excellent," "reputable," and "talented" poets who are still there specializing in flowers, moons, and my lover... singing praises of nature and love songs; or filling the pages with loneliness,寂寞, dreams, illusions... and specializing in expressing a kind of 末世情绪 of 无病呻吟. Obviously, these poets, constrained by the life and consciousness of their respective classes, are unable or unwilling to grasp the correct outlook on life and the world; therefore, before this great era, they cannot but become color-blind, deaf, or try their best to close their eyes and cover their ears as if nothing had happened; they have already become unable to see the disasters, persecutions, abuses... all over the land, and they are unable to hear the enemy's artillery fire and the laments and roars of the suffering masses... As a result, for them, losing love is more worthy of sorrow and heartache than losing the Northeast, 热河, or even all of China! The so-called loneliness and寂寞, which completely belong to the personal realm, are more worthy of being expressed and depicted than any suffering and disaster of the masses! You think, how can this kind of "poet who ignores the masses and only sings about himself and his own affairs" produce great works that reflect and express the times? How can they gain the sympathy and love of readers? And if there are too many poets like this, how can the poetry scene not be desolate? ...</p>
<p>This can be said to be an evil tendency in the content of New Poetry that should be given the most merciless blows and corrections. Secondly, in terms of form and expression, we can also find those tendencies that should also be struck and corrected.</p>
<p>First, there is the tendency to start from formalism and try to standardize and formalize New Poetry. Anyone who has paid a little attention to the trends in the poetry scene will know that, whether in the past or present, there have been many poets who are making a big deal out of Western-style forms or styles of poetry; as a result, many so-called sonnets, "square poems," and so on have been produced. Obviously, this is an attempt to standardize and formalize New Poetry; that is, a kind of degeneration and restoration in the New Poetry movement, a new chain and shackle. Of course, we do not oppose people paying attention to form; on the contrary, we also acknowledge that a poet has the full right to seek the most appropriate and perfect form to express a specific content; we also understand that a good poem is not only due to its rich and substantial content, but also due to its complete and beautiful appearance. However, what must be noted here is that our emphasis on form absolutely cannot surpass the principle that form is subordinate to content, or that content is superior to form. Because we always believe that if your body is healthy and beautiful, then even being naked without a thread is not a problem, and may even make your health and beauty more obvious; on the contrary, if you are a "skeleton" without flesh and blood, then even if you put on the most gorgeous clothes and apply three inches of thick makeup, people will still shy away. Moreover, to go one step further, as is generally known, a rigid and fixed format will indeed give the content the greatest束缚 and桎梏. Why did we abandon old poetry? That is because its various unreasonable restrictions and metrics do not allow us to express the thoughts and feelings of modern people. Of course, you may say that forms like the 商籁体 are not the forms of our country's old poetry, but genuine, authentic imported goods. However, you must understand that we are of course utterly opposed to the "national essence" of foot-binding and ear-piercing for Chinese women; but at the same time, we also absolutely do not approve of their "Western-style" wearing high heels and perming their hair; because in terms of "unnaturalness" and artificiality, those are originally half a pound each. In short, this attempt to standardize and formalize New Poetry, to expose the 洋鏡, is a method of cutting your feet to fit the shoes, a trick to try to use form to cover up empty content, and it will cause New Poetry, which has finally jumped out of the mud pit of old poetry, to throw itself into a new trap again.</p>
<p>First, there is the tendency to write poetry that is very obscure and ambiguous. In recent years, some so-called symbolist, mystic, and imagist poets have appeared on the Chinese New Poetry scene. It is said that their motivation for writing is purely to express a light and hazy sentiment, image, and momentary感興. Their works, when read, are not only full of "吗吧呀呢," making one feel like listening to foreigners speaking Chinese, or looking at a clumsy and stiff text translated from a foreign language; moreover, even if you read their entire work very carefully, you often don't know what our "profound and unfathomable poets are saying? What are they expressing, reading is equivalent to not reading (unfortunately, due to space limitations at this moment, I cannot copy out a few of their masterpieces so that everyone can concentrate on guessing what tricks our poets are playing and what kind of mysterious things they are doing). In a word, that is: their works are generally written in colloquial language; but they are exceptionally obscure and ambiguous, making people almost suspect that they are "heavenly scriptures" or the like. The production of this kind of work, perhaps our poets have their own "brilliant" explanations and arguments; but in my opinion, despite the different sects and the different patterns of each other, due to the emptiness of the content, they cannot but tumble and perform tricks in terms of form and expression in order to cover up this point, they have a blood relationship with formalists. Because in fact, as the critic Mirsky said: "Many poets try hard to make themselves incomprehensible because they have nothing worth understanding to say." Regarding this tendency in the poetry scene, Hu Shih and Liang Shiqiu have also recently specially criticized and criticized it, saying that those poems that cannot be understood are "stupid riddles" and "a decadent literary trend," and also said: "People have to speak human language, and poets also have to speak human language, and the first requirement of human language is to be clear and clear" (see Hu Shih's "Talking about 'Hu Shih Style' Poetry" and Liang's "I Also Talk About 'Hu Shih Style' Poetry" in "Free Review, Issue 22"). However, Shao Xunmei did not think so, and wrote articles refuting them in the "Ren Yan Weekly," and even further cited foreign classics, based on foreign canons, and tried his best to praise the so-called "great obscurity." However, to be fair, if obscurity is also called "greatness," then there would be too few things in the world that are not great!</p>
<p>The above-mentioned tendencies can be said to be three detours for New Poetry in terms of content and form. If future poetry continues to follow these detours, then I dare say that it not only has no hope of revival, but will undoubtedly run to a dead end! Therefore, I hope that those who are dedicated to the poetry movement can use their greatest strength to pull it back from those detours, whether in theory or in works!</p>

<p>— Xinlao</p>
<p>Homesickness has become a disease for me. I always miss it, and sometimes it makes me even more melancholy. When spring comes, I think of the newly green meadows in my hometown; the sound of the water river bursting; on the newly melted muddy country roads, many feet and hooves sink in and out; and the snow water on the snowy peaks flows into small fountains; it's really beautiful!</p>
<p>Although the spring scenery of Jiangnan is beautiful, people who drift in other places cannot get a little spring nourishment.</p>
<p>——The spring of my hometown is spread all over the ground, stained with the felt hearts of every traveler. When the pomegranate flowers are full of branches, summer comes. Just this heat has already made me unable to forget the peace of the past in my hometown, sitting on that misty hillside, butterflies dancing in front of my eyes, from the 山刺梅, from the dandelion, from the 山牡丹, and then flying to the purple flowers of the 山兰——butterflies, there are not none here, and they are even more beautiful; it's just that in the bias of homesickness, they reduce their color.</p>
<p>Leaves are falling from the roadside plane trees, it's autumn here. I think of the 龙葵 in the weeds of my hometown; when the small black berries are eaten in my mouth——what a flavorful memory, in my childhood...</p>
<p>And winter is coming. The big snow in my hometown is the most memorable and longing for me. The snow covers the high mountains and low thatched houses; standing in the middle of the field, it will really be like being in a boundless snow sea; the spin lifted by the fierce wind, the snow sand like waves is flying; but how much of the shadow of snow can be seen here? Very little.</p>
<p>Because of this, every winter, I am parched with thirst for snow, I think of the big snowflakes in my hometown like flowers.</p>
<p>However, the hometown I miss, that green hillside, is full of corpses; the earth is probably crying too, right? Under the cruel slaughter of ××, even sparrows are probably unable to jump freely!</p>
<p>Walking on the small road that I used to walk, inspecting the courtyard where I used to live... I will point and say one by one: This is the ditch where I used to fish; this is the bank where I used to pile sand; this is the pavilion where I used to sit; this is the hillside where I used to run; this is the land where I used to insert myself; this is the forest where I used to hunt birds; this is...</p>
<p>If such a day comes, what would I, no, what should I do? Think about it! Cry like a child? Or roll around and laugh haha?</p>
<p>However, this day is so distant that whenever it rains here, I will think of the sky in my hometown. For six years, it has been so陰沉, so desolate, so miserable. Like my heart, gray clouds are飄荡.</p>
<p>When will my hometown be sunny? When will my heart be sunny? ——I can't help but think like this all the time. Think like this.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with fluctuations of two points up or down across various months. Bullish positions were being liquidated, and domestic and foreign firms placed limit orders to buy, leading to uneven price movements for hedging. Subsequently, due to the liquidation of bullish positions and selling from the Far East, market conditions weakened. However, persistent drought in the eastern regions meant that all sales were absorbed by new speculative buying. Manufacturers were also more active in their purchases. The spread between July and October contracts narrowed slightly. When the cotton was held at 11.65 cents, the July contract was sold off. In the afternoon, bullish positions were liquidated again, coupled with local selling, further weakening the market. At closing, some short covering provided some stability. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures prices, except for a two-point increase in July, fell by four to eight points. British cotton spot prices rose by five points, and futures prices rose by 23 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. Original telegram as follows (dated 3rd):</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 4th, No. 34 cotton yarn futures fluctuated between 0.10 and 0.30 yen. Near-month contracts were at 185.60 yen, and far-month contracts were at 194.20 yen.

<p>Yesterday, the piece goods market initially showed positive signs, following the rising trend of foreign cotton prices in Japan. However, the subsequent weakness in yarn and cotton prices on the exchange, coupled with widespread rumors in the market and a sharp drop in the value of Guangdong currency, caused unease. The market has since stabilized somewhat. The thin and twilled fabrics from Guangdong and Yunnan had long been in short supply, with dwindling inventories. Recently, there has been a gradual increase in procurement, leading to a turnaround in the market. However, due to exchange rate concerns, Guangdong merchants telegraphed their principals requesting delayed transactions. If the overall situation stabilizes, sales prospects are promising. Printed fabrics enjoyed brisk sales in the spring season this year, with various factories competing to manufacture them, resulting in a doubling of output. Later, due to poor market conditions and the detrimental impact of smuggled goods in South China, sales plummeted, and prices fell sharply. "Croco" silk, previously sold for 6.60-6.70 yuan, now sells for only 5.50-5.60 yuan. Similarly, printed fabrics priced above 6 yuan now fetch only 4.70-4.80 yuan, representing a significant decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the woolens public interest group showed a positive trend. Both morning and afternoon saw transactions in goods suitable for summer sales. Unbleached rice color linen calico and yarn calico were particularly popular, with large quantities being purchased by Western clothing businesses in the city and along the Beijing-Hangzhou route. This is because most of this summer's large firm uniforms are made from this unbleached rice color. Yesterday, both Western and domestically produced goods saw considerable sales. Western goods, such as unbleached rice linen calico from three Hong Kong companies, including Ruwen, Shi Li, and Luo Kai, were offered at over 400 yards, priced at 2.10 yuan. Japanese goods from Yiji Company were offered at over 500 yards, priced at 1.50 yuan. Domestically produced unbleached rice yarn calico, resold by brokers, was offered at over 700 yards, priced at 0.45 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Thursday marked the 2992nd auction of Yuanfang Foreign Goods Company, showcasing 29 cases of various goods. The market saw limited arrivals of foreign goods and sluggish transactions. Prices for Western silk stood firm, while velvet was slightly weaker. Straight-tribute wool, Yuanfu silk remained stable. Yuanyu silk showed minor fluctuations across different brands. Heavyweight red broadcloth was not considered, while prices for blue broadcloth and white yarn crepe were similar to the previous period. Bleached cloth continued to be ranked with the "Five Flower Cave Eighteen Sons" mark, with only six sales and prices 0.30 to 0.40 yuan higher.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market experienced a pattern of initial gains followed by a weakening trend across various months. Foreign wheat quotations saw a slight improvement of 0.04 in Chicago and 0.10 to 0.20 in Canada. Opening prices were firm due to the slight improvement in foreign wheat prices and uncertain weather conditions. The highest price for the current month reached 3.065 yuan, with far-month contracts also rising by about 0.01 yuan. However, by the second session, small-scale bulls gradually began to liquidate their positions, causing sentiment to gradually weaken, falling by about 0.01 yuan from the highest level. The afternoon session saw sluggish trading, with factories slightly reducing their offerings, leading to a gradual easing of far-month contracts. However, the current situation is largely influenced by hedging considerations, and as the wheat season has not yet peaked, both insiders and outsiders are adopting a wait-and-see approach. Significant developments will likely be delayed until there is concrete information on supply and demand.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Wheat Futures Market Relatively Calm, Weather Still Uncertain, Buying and Selling Marked by Caution <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally calm across various months after the morning opening. As the weather remained uncertain and foreign wheat quotations saw a slight improvement of 0.10 to 0.20 yuan, both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious approach. With limited competition, price fluctuations were minimal. Regarding this year's wheat situation, the northern regions have benefited from favorable weather conditions, resulting in a better harvest than in previous years. Furthermore, the harvest time is earlier than in the southern regions. Based on this, market sentiment is likely to change during the peak delivery period. During the afternoon opening, buying interest suddenly waned, while offerings remained scarce. Near-term contracts saw a slight improvement, but trading was not very brisk, lacking vitality. Future developments will depend on the full arrival of the new wheat crop and how factory demand and sales progress.</p>
<p>The average estimate for US wheat production is 501,000,000 bushels for winter wheat and 236,000,000 bushels for spring wheat, roughly in line with expectations. Drought in the Northwest has a stabilizing effect on prices, but short-selling will soon have an impact. Exports from Soviet Russia are also causing some concern.</p>

<p>The first batch of new broad beans from Jiujiang arrived in port today, totaling only 22 bags. The quality is decent. They were handled by Dongyang merchants and priced at 4 yuan. Over 150 bags of new broad beans from Wenzhou were offered, priced at 4.10 yuan and 3.57 yuan, distributed to local shops by Dongyang merchants. Market sentiment is stable, with little change for the time being. Soybeans are dull and lifeless.

<p>Yesterday, "Ke Xian" and "Ke Hua" rice became even more sluggish. Although Fuzhou merchants made some attempts to stimulate demand, their purchases were very weak, with total transactions amounting to less than 1,000 bags. Merchants from inland regions and Quanzhou remained hesitant. Local shops had a slight demand for milled rice, but purchases were also weak, leading to a slight reduction of 0.03 to 0.05 yuan in market prices for various types of rice. If demand for "Ke Xian" and "Ke Hua" rice does not increase, the market may decline further. Throughout the day, 1,600 bags of Jiangxi milled early and late rice were offered, along with 681 bags of Jiangbei rice. There were no transactions for other types of rice.</p>
<h3 id="e206">River Rice Transactions Very Sparse <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various sources totaled nearly 30, with a total of over 6,000 piculs. Local sales were scarce, and merchants from the Beiyang region only purchased 200-300 bags, leading to a weak market. The price difference between new and old glutinous rice was unclear, with higher-grade rice reduced by a few points and lower-grade rice reduced by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Due to limited quantities, Dudu pointed rice and Yinyuan rice showed no change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 25-26 boats arrived from various river regions. Local sales of various types of rice were sluggish, with white glutinous rice remaining quiet and thin indica rice trading sluggishly. Yinyuan white rice saw little demand, while Yangdudu pointed rice had some transactions. Sales of port passenger pointed rice were also very sluggish. Prices for white glutinous rice fell slightly by a few points, almost reaching 0.10 yuan. Thin indica rice also fell by a small amount of 0.10 yuan. Yinyuan white rice held firm at high quality, while lower grades fell by 0.06-0.07 yuan. Yangdudu pointed rice held steady, while port passenger pointed rice fell by 0.04-0.05 yuan. Other types of rice also showed a weakening trend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai silk market showed some activity as Yokohama silk prices closed higher the previous night. Yesterday, New York white filature silk of 20/22 denier, grade 7/8, improved by 0.01 for near-term and 0.05 for far-term deliveries. Yokohama near and far deliveries rose by 2 yuan. Lyon silk prices also gradually stabilized, making overseas accounts more approachable. Dachan, Xinfu and other firms made considerable purchases. White filature silk of 20/22 denier traded around 580 yuan, a drop of about 100 yuan in legal tender compared to early last month.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm black and green tea market was not deserted. Total market transactions of Qimen, Fuliang, Zhilde and other black teas, as well as green teas from various regions, reached over 4,800 chests. High-grade "Chouxin Zhenmei" green tea from Wudong Tunxi opened at 148 yuan, an increase of 4-5 yuan compared to the previous price. Pingshui pearl tea also rebounded by 3-4 yuan. Well-crafted "Zhenmei" from Suian was still sold for 76-78 yuan, while poorly crafted tea sold for 70 yuan. Regarding "Zhenmei" from other local regions, only "Chouxin" tea saw some transactions, with little trading activity overall. The black tea market saw good sales for the first batch of high-grade Qimen tea, but inventory was limited. "Zhihong" tea saw the largest sales, with Jardine Matheson continuing to show strong interest. Over thirty transactions were completed throughout the day, indicating a positive trend. However, sales of Fuliang tea were slightly sluggish.</p>

The 120 Denier "Tianqiao" brand, which can be transshipped to the interior, was priced at 390 yuan. Japanese firms traded a few cases of 300 Denier Hiroshima brand for 395 yuan. From yesterday onwards, goods for which import duties have been paid must be accompanied by a duty-paid certificate issued by customs to prove their legitimacy.

Chaozhou merchants offered 31 bags of "Caifa Qing" brand goods at 9.75 yuan, and bag merchants offered 60+ bags of "Caiji Red" brand sugar at 11.20 yuan. According to a telegram from Shantou, exchange rates are tightening again, rising by 20 yuan to 1,220 yuan, with a continued upward trend. Sugar prices for red and white sugar increased, such as Shangzhiyang at 14.20 yuan, Qibai at 14.60 yuan, Zhengchi at 12.80 yuan. There was little change in green sugar prices, but the margin for brokers was barely sufficient.</p>

<p>Tinplate is a widely used product in yarn factories, toy factories, and military factories. Last year, due to a shortage of goods and dwindling inventories, prices soared uncontrollably, with No. 24 tinplate reaching 400 yuan per box or 8 yuan per sheet (50 sheets per box) and No. 26 tinplate selling for 200 yuan per box or 4 yuan per sheet (also 50 sheets per box). However, buyers still struggled to acquire them, prompting industry players to place orders overseas, leading to a sudden surge in arrivals. Unfortunately, sales are sluggish, and with ample profits to be made, traders are lowering prices further and further. Currently, No. 24 tinplate is sold for 150 yuan per box or 3 yuan per sheet, while No. 26 tinplate is offered at 100 yuan per box or 2 yuan per sheet. Transactions are only sporadic, with no activity from customer groups or military factories. It is reported that new goods have arrived at the new Taikoo Gonghexiang warehouses in the past two days, totaling about 70-80 boxes, further exacerbating the market's weakness.</p>

<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>On the third of this month, "Miss Health of Nanjing" was chosen. The story goes that Nanjing's Ginling Women's College, recognizing that today's aesthetic focus for women should be on health rather than outward appearance, initiated the "Miss Health of Nanjing" competition. All students and faculty members had the right to vote and be elected. Seven candidates were chosen based on the number of votes received, with the top vote-getters being elected and the next thirty being named "Healthy Students." The health standards were fourfold: 1. Healthy internal organs (verified by the school doctor); 2. Correct posture (including weight); 3. Natural, non-stiff movements; 4. Active spirit and agile movements. This campaign may be a pioneering effort. Originally, everyone knew that not long ago, "frailty" was a well-known characteristic of Chinese women. In fact, it was generally believed that women with a sickly appearance were beautiful. So at that time, typical daughters of wealthy families considered delicacy and "flatness" to be the most "modern" forms of "beauty."</p>
<p>However, it's undeniable that for thousands of years, Chinese women were suppressed under the poisonous influence of the feudal system, resulting in the adoption of customs and decorations that were physiologically and hygienically unsound, such as foot-binding, chest-binding, tight waists, and wearing earrings and necklaces. These inherited adornments, intended to enhance beauty, unintentionally shackled them with invisible chains, restricting their freedom throughout their lives. Although after the May Fourth Movement, some women were liberated from the shackles of foot-binding and chest-binding, the general aesthetic standard still favored "seductiveness" and "delicacy"!</p>
<p>Originally, this aesthetic standard was shared by people in Europe and America. However, the situation is different now. The British explorer Mr. Gore once said, "We cannot judge a woman's beauty based on past aesthetic standards. In the past, beauty was defined by seductiveness, but now, healthy beauty should be the standard. Soviet women now work as hard as men, and even exercise more diligently than men to compensate for their natural physical deficiencies. Their waists and hips are well-proportioned, and their legs and arms are full and strong. Their skin tone is between white and red, and they do not wear makeup, fully expressing natural beauty. Their lifestyle is simpler than that of European and American women, which is their only merit. Therefore, there is no doubt that Soviet women are considered the most beautiful women in the world."</p>
<p>However, today, young women should not only free themselves from the sickly appearance of the past and acquire a healthy and beautiful physique, but also remember the greater social responsibilities they should assume as modern women. Otherwise, they will simply become beautiful but useless shells!</p>
<h3 id="e215">Ms. Pan Yuliang's Art Exhibition <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shutian</p>
<p>The fine rain fell densely, gradually growing heavier. I greatly enjoyed such rainy days, and the long-awaited art exhibition of Ms. Pan, which opened today, made it imperative for me to brave the rain. Thinking that I needed two companions to see the art exhibition, I invited Mr. and Mrs. Fu Xue.</p>
<p>The venue was the China Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Edward VII. The road was quiet, and there was no ostentation. Usually, there are many large white cloths hanging horizontally and vertically on the streets when an exhibition opens, but I didn't see any today. Only a horizontal cloth at the entrance of the venue was wet from the rain.</p>
<p>Seeing that many people had arrived according to the signature book, we quietly walked into the first exhibition room. The first impression was that there were too many paintings, too small, arranged too densely, and the labels were too black and too large, obscuring the vividness of the paintings. The second exhibition room was much better. On the east wall, there was a self-portrait of the artist that I liked very much. The simple brushstrokes and thin colors could express the mystery of light and color. That childish smile and that naiveté immediately connected me to her emotionally. If I were not a close friend of the artist, and if I didn't think it was wrong to be a thief, I might have stolen her painting.</p>
<p>There were two hundred pieces by the artist. From these two hundred pieces, one could see the artist's travels and enthusiasms over the years. After returning from France, she visited many famous scenic spots in China. An artist is like a poet or writer. Without traveling thousands of miles and reading thousands of books, there will be no significant gains. I believe that an artist's works are not unrelated to their thoughts, experiences, and environment. I also believe that the achievements of every artist are not accidental but result from considerable experience and hard work.</p>
<p>After seeing Ms. Pan's paintings, I became even more convinced that the achievements of effort have life. The artist's brushstrokes are vigorous while not forgetting delicacy and tenderness, with a grand perspective and attention to detail. She is also skilled in using grayscale colors. We all know that artists are most afraid of using gray because it easily makes paintings dull, but Ms. Pan's skills are skilled and bold, and she can use gray to reflect the vividness of the painting.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about how Ms. Pan's paintings gave me insight and affection. In many landscape paintings, such as "Welcoming Pine of Huangshan," "Three Hidden Pools of Xuedou Mountain in Fenghua," "Blue Dragon Ridge of Huashan," and "Seashore of Qingdao," the composition is very unique, and the colors and values are bright and dark, making each painting vivid. The pine of Huangshan is majestic, the mountain ridge is towering, and the sea is both calm and turbulent. There is also a painting called "Pine in White Cloud Cave of Laoshan," which is even more serene and grand. The colors of the sky are well painted.</p>
<p>In figure paintings, "Coolie," "Old Prostitute," and "Fugitive" are all full of vitality. Looking at them, it seems that their cells are jumping there. When I saw "Coolie," I unconsciously thought of endurance and hunger. That laborious face, wrinkled and thin, decadent and brave, enduring. He has worked, he has been diligent. The empty basket in his hand and the pipe in his mouth show a little joy and comfort after he has sold his labor. "Fugitive" is also a powerful work. The muscles of the whole body and the expression on the face fully express the melancholy, the struggle of life, and the distress. But "Old Prostitute" shows a disgusting, superficial, boring, shameful, and even chewable soul. That is the gray life. I cannot but admire the artist's mysterious and varied brush. I feel that the artist is not an ordinary artist. She can understand life and penetrate the mind, and she pays attention to everyday life, chewing and savoring it, and always paying attention. After seeing Ms. Pan's paintings, the face of a Russian friend could not help but appear in my mind, that is the face of Lorskaya. Her frankness, liveliness, and hard work are just like Ms. Pan. Lorskaya, because she sympathized with the poor, she roamed in the front gate area of ​​Beijing every day. Sometimes she went to the workers' area to paint the poor, and when she came back, she sculpted in her small studio. I remember that there was a large wooden board with many sculptures on it, all of which were the faces and figures of various coolies. It is said that she has now returned to Russia and has not only become a sculptor but also a painter and a female actor.</p>
<p>I hope that Ms. Pan will not only become a painter, but also a thoughtful writer, because she loves literature very much.</p>

<p>In front of my house, there is a vast open space, which is a public land. The neighboring residents each use thin bamboo poles to divide it into their own gardens, planting some seasonal vegetables. In front of the open space is a small river. Because the terrain there is higher, the small river is only knee-deep when the official river is at high tide.</p>

<p>We could clearly see the scattered bricks and mud path at the bottom of the creek. At low tide, the rushing water sprayed against the bricks, creating a subtle melody, and the agitated bubbles followed the cracks between the bricks, forming water rings as they flowed into the official river. My companions and I grew up by that small creek. There were stone steps that led directly into the heart of the creek. We would watch the depth of the water and play on the steps. Water was of great interest to every child, and summer was the perfect season. We would sit on the lowest step, our four legs submerged in the heart of the creek, the water splashing against our soles. We even fell asleep on the steps, and by the time we woke up, our lower bodies were completely soaked. But we loved the water. We would secretly change our clothes and continue to watch the sunset on the steps. What made us happiest was when the tide rose, because the creek was narrow. We would weigh down the large manure baskets from the fields with large stones and place them with their mouths facing the incoming tide. The water would flow through the bamboo slits of the baskets, dragging parallel fine lines that disappeared backwards. If the water was rushing, those fine lines would form a beautiful pattern that cannot be described with words. And the small fish and shrimp brought in by the tide would be trapped in the baskets. We would raise those catches in a large vat in the backyard. Within a few days, the fish and shrimp in the vat were quite impressive, so we would spend half of our time visiting them in the backyard every day. When my father discovered this, he praised our intelligence. My father suffered from a severe heart condition, and he followed the doctor's orders to rest quietly in the yard every day, rarely moving around. When he learned about our fishing method in the creek, he would often lean on his cane and have a servant move a rattan chair so he could sit in the open space and watch us playing on the steps. But when my father had to go back inside, he always wanted us to go home with him. However, he knew we hadn't had enough fun, so he would stroke our hair and say with a smile, "Let's go home and have fun!" He was really happy and brought out a glass fish tank, spread stone pebbles for growing daffodils on the bottom, and selected a few more lively fish to raise in it. He spent his time enjoying it every day under the lamp.</p>
<p>My companion was my cousin from my aunt's family. Both my uncle and aunt passed away early, and my father, because she was his sister's flesh and blood, raised her in our home and sent her to school, just like me. But when my cousin entered middle school, it was during the height of the May Fourth Movement. That middle school experienced a major incident, and my cousin disappeared as a result. My father almost fainted because of her. Later, he passed away in grief. On his deathbed, he held my hand and spoke all the words he had stored in his heart: "She is a smart girl. She must have been deceived by someone. She hasn't been heard from for so many years. I'm sorry to your aunt for dying. You must find her!" I originally wanted her to be my wife, but that wish has naturally been dashed. But you must find her!</p>
<p>After my father died, I searched in every direction, but in this vast sea of people, I never found any news of my companion from the creek. For many years, I wandered everywhere, almost forgetting my father's unfulfilled wish. Recently, a neighbor sent me a letter, telling me that the local public land had been bought cheaply by powerful individuals who had devised a way to do so with the local authorities. The small creek has also been filled in, and they are now constructing houses. It is common in my hometown for local bullies and gentry to seize public land and fill in a small creek. Before their final days arrive, their actions can only force us to swallow our anger. But the creek holds my beautiful childhood dreams. My cousin is drifting in who-knows-what place, and now they are building houses on that small creek. This made me think of my father's last words again. I'm afraid his last words will ultimately go unfulfilled.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Straw Bags <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>This series of straw shacks is filled with two hundred and eighty-one straw bags.</p>
<p>The young and strong men have all been selected to build highways, leaving only these women, children, and old men who can only eat and are of no use.</p>
<p>Each of them has a hometown, beautiful and fertile fields where their desire for life blossomed. They all shed blood and sweat happily to firmly grasp that living hope, burying their hard labor deep in the fragrant soil, and then drawing a trace of innocent smiles on their tired and taut faces.</p>
<p>Isn't that how it is? Extracting scarce necessities from a large amount of hard work, this is how ancestors have been struggling since long ago. They were faithful to their ancestors' reality, never being lazy and never disobeying the increasingly declining gray "fate." Sometimes, under the weight of life, they felt suffocated, as if grasped tightly by something, but they did overcome this accumulated depression in the joy of working together.</p>
<p>In the past, in the hazy and cool morning mist or bathed in the rose-colored sunset, young and strong couples, children, and old people would smell the fertile and sweet scent of the soil. They were busy, working, and everywhere echoed with bright and pleasant short folk songs, as if they never knew what fatigue was. They were entirely intoxicated in the sacred work.</p>
<p>Like a volcanic eruption, they were thrown far away to a strange foreign land. Then, the past scenes turned into beautiful dreams, fragmented and remaining in the chaotic and turbulent mind without becoming complete.</p>
<p>Now, they have not only lost paradise, but also freedom, and everything...</p>
<p>They are a group of slaves, receiving no sympathy at all. Everything is cold and unfamiliar. Everything in this foreign land seems to have no connection to them, as if it does not welcome this group of guests who have suffered for their "fate." Therefore, they are swirling the common question in their minds: "Who called us to be like this? We used to have homes!..." But this question has never been answered.</p>
<p>"You bastards... straw bags! What use are you? Huh..."</p>
<p>The director shouts like this every time he comes to inspect. He impatiently waves the rattan cane, whipping people, but he always covers his nose with one hand, so he only leaves here hastily for a while to take a deep breath outside.</p>
<p>"Damn it!... No... no... What's the use of living? Grandma's..."</p>
<p>The director seems to be hurt by these straw bags in the straw shacks. Every time, every time, he loses his temper. If there were no straw shacks, he definitely wouldn't have that ugly face.</p>
<p>"Hey, the sorghum is running out again, is it..." The accountant said to the director, "If... we don't pay back a batch of money first, the rice shop won't extend credit anymore!..."</p>
<p>"What are you shouting for? Do you need to be so loud? Damn it! These wastes only know how to eat! Only give each person two small bowls a day... Grandma, wouldn't it be enough if we cooked it a little raw?..."</p>
<p>"Compared to charcoal, firewood... we also need to buy some. Don't put the money..."</p>
<p>"Um... this... this I know... Tsk! There's really no way... really..."</p>
<p>"I heard... I heard that someone from above is coming to check... the accounts, the money, and those things of yours... how, how are we going to explain that?..." The accountant pressed even closer.</p>
<p>"………………"</p>
<p>After a long time, the director slapped his fist on his palm and said:</p>
<p>"Damn it, okay, we'll do it this way..." He walked closer to the accountant and put his mouth close to the accountant's ear. "…………Is that right? Hmm..." He patted the accountant's shoulder: "Hey, buddy! Is there any kindness in this world? Hmm... You get a share!... "</p>
<p>The director smiled, and the accountant smiled too.</p>
<p>Night fell on this desolate wilderness. Some dilapidated mounds lay quietly in the wilderness, without a sound. That series of straw shacks was already blurred in the dim night! Two hundred and eighty-one straw bags breathed out melancholy tunes in lonely dreams. Only in dreams, and only in dreams, did they return to their beautiful hometown and get some comfort that could not be realized.</p>

<p>— Written by Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Lilya: After your explanation, I have great doubts about that fancy meal I just had! If that chef isn't from the British Embassy, ​​haven't I been taken for a ride?</p>
<p>Jinghong: That doesn't count as being taken for a ride. Anyway, it's true that your stomach is full. The rest is a matter of what you need psychologically. Because people who like fancy food often like</p>
<p>Lilya: To like French and British food. If you use the terms of French and British food to cater to the psychology of general diners, you will definitely be able to achieve the effect of generating wealth in your business. As for whether the chef on the dining car has worked at the British Embassy, ​​you don’t need to investigate. In fact, you are eating fancy dishes made by Chinese people, but psychologically, you can only tell the difference between British-flavored fancy dishes and Chinese-flavored fancy dishes. What else is there? Why do you feel so upset about this? Anyway, it's fine as long as your stomach is full.</p>
<p>Lilya: I spent so much money on fancy food because I wanted to eat authentic British-flavored fancy food, otherwise, wouldn't I just eat fried rice? Fried rice can also fill you up—really! I'm really a fool among the ordinary people! A country bumpkin! A simpleton! I'm so angry! I'm really too gullible!</p>
<p>Jinghong: Why are you regretting it now? Didn't you just say that people who eat fancy food always eat fancy food? I think a person who eats so-called fancy food must naturally have a big heart. So-called big people eat fancy food, ride in big cars, watch big plays, spend big money, tell big stories, and their hearts must be big, and the situation must be even bigger. Everything is big, isn't it?</p>

<p>The Master said, "Even among the barbarians, if there is a ruler, it is better than the lack of civilization among the various Xia." The Ji family sacrificed to Mount Tai. The Master said to Ran You, "Can you not save this?" He replied, "I cannot." The Master said, "Alas! Would Mount Tai be less knowledgeable than Lin Fang?" The Master said, "The noble man does not contend for anything. If he must, let it be archery. He bows and yields as they ascend, and drinks as they descend. Their contention is that of noble men."</p>
<p>Zi Xia asked, "With a clever smile and lovely eyes, adorned with plainness, what does it mean?" The Master said, "Painting comes after a plain base." He said, "Is ritual secondary?" The Master said, "It is Shang who inspires me. Now I can speak about poetry with him."</p>
<p>The Master said, "I can speak of the Xia rituals, but Qi is not enough to attest to them. I can speak of the Yin rituals, but Song is not enough to attest to them. It is because the records and wise men are insufficient. If they were sufficient, I could attest to them."</p>
<p>The Master said, "I do not wish to observe the Di sacrifice after the libation has been poured." Someone asked about the explanation of the Di sacrifice. The Master said, "I do not know. He who knows its explanation, in relation to the world, is like showing it here." He pointed to his palm.</p>

<h3 id="e228">"Peach Blossom Spring Dream" and Half-Naked Women <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The scenery of mountains and peaks is set up in the photography studio of Xinhua Company. When you get off the tram at Xujiahui, you can vaguely see it in the distance. At the foot of this mountain is the Peach Blossom Village of "Peach Blossom Spring Dream." In a very important scene, not only Han Langen and Liu Jiqun are making a lot of jokes here, but also Tong Yuejuan and Xu Manli appear in strange and bizarre half-naked costumes. Because this "Peach Blossom Village" seems to be in another uncivilized nation, the things worn by the men, women, old, and young there are very few and very thin, and there is a sense of beauty when you are among them. In this way, it is really fun on the screen. It is known that when the stage drama was being filmed, various difficult problems arose. For example, this scene requires seventy young girls. It is not difficult for the theater affairs department to recruit these seventy young girls, but if they are asked to take off their clothes and put on thin gauze, it is not an easy task. Before Xinhua Company started filming this scene of "Peach Blossom Spring Dream," it had considered this point. Originally, it had planned to have seventy girls, and specially asked someone to recruit ninety, preparing for the possibility that twenty girls would refuse to take off their clothes. As a result, among these ninety girls, as many as forty expressed their unwillingness and returned, leaving fifty girls to complete this unique and aesthetically pleasing scene.</p>

<p>Chen Juanjuan appeared on the screen as a nine-year-old girl, but her achievements are no less than those of "big children." Among the child stars in China, Chen Juanjuan is of course the best. Now, Chen Juanjuan and her mother-in-law both feel that filming one film here and one film there is unstable. Starting in June, she officially joined Xinhua Company and became a basic actor of Xinhua. Xinhua has great hopes for Chen Juanjuan and has entrusted a "major screenwriter" to write a script specifically for this child.</p>

<p>The film is scheduled to be released today at the Great Light</p>
<p>The song and dance epic "The Singing Kid" starring Al Jolson is scheduled to be released today (Friday) at the Great Light. Because Al Jolson is a meritorious official of Warner Bros., the company has spent a lot of money on the film he stars in, and the supporting actors are also particularly valued. In addition to Al Jolson, the film also features Beverly Roberts, a newcomer to the scene in 1936, baby star Sybil Gibson, comedian Edward Horton, and Alan Dinehart, who play minor roles in the play, making it even more beautiful. In the singing part, the famous band leader Kyle Carroll and his "Hot Band", and the four famous singers of the American Yacht Club have joined hands to cooperate. There is not much dialogue in the film. The entire atmosphere vibrates between the fast-paced singing and dancing shadows. In short, this "Glamour of the Singing World" can be called a supreme entertainment musical dance drama.</p>
