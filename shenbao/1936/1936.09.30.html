<h3>英美法貨幣恊定成立</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這幾年來。英美經濟學者如奧文揚。歐文斐雪。保愛什。亞搭爾薩爾德等倡導着世界貨幣安定運動。他們以為國際的貨幣衝突儘管嚴重。可是等到大家感覺者痛苦的時候。自然會協議休戰。無論如何。解决貨幣問題總是人力之所能及的。這種運動的理想。現在因英法美三國貨幣協定的成立。可以說已經初步實現了。</p>
<p>英美法三國對於幣制上的國際合作。是早就抱着共同的願望的。一九三三年世界經濟會議的召集便根據於這一個願望。可是當時隨着經濟恐慌而到來的經濟國家主義的浪潮。郤使那决會議終究免不了陂裂。此後國際貨幣上展開了金圓。金鎊和金本位這三大集團的鬭爭。這貨幣戰一步步劇烈起來。造成世界經濟上非常的不安。於三方面都有害無益。於是英美法三大國重復注意到三年以前他們共同的宿願了。英美的貨幣戰。自從中國改革幣制以後就顯得和緩下去。今年在歐洲空前緊張的局面之下。法國財政經濟上嚴重的困難。又使英美深感到加以援助的必要。因此經過了三個月的秘密恊商。英美法的貨幣協定便產生了。</p>
<p>這項協定的核心是在法郞减低平價。法國自從英美相繼停止金本位以後。工業生產陷於停滯狀態。而國際收支也逐年惡化。年來國內存金大量地流運出去。形成法國財政經濟上深刻的恐慌。唯一的救濟辦法。就是法郞貶値。歷屆內閣所以逆水行舟似的支撑着法郞的原値。無非因為戰後法郞崩落的災難還活躍地遺留在人民的腦際罷了。現在入民政府跟英美兩國締結了貨幣協定把。法郞的價値固定於九成金〇·〇四九公分至〇·〇四三公分之間。這在一方面使國際匯兌上不致發生嚴重的擾亂。在另一方面則使政府可以用存金價値重估後一百三十萬萬法郞的盈餘來調整國內的經濟秩序。關於法郞貶値的不良影響的憂慮。這才大部分消除了。貶値以後。不但在法國本身。對外貿易可以復興。財政困難可以解除。而且就世界經濟而言。貨幣比價穩定的基礎從此奠定。世界工商業景氣也可以回復些兒。因此法衆議院昨日很順利地通過這個法案了。</p>
<p>可是在國際政治方面。法國的幣制改革。及其連帶的三國關係。却還有着更重大的意義。任何國家的政治和經濟是不能分離的。英美法都是主張維持現世界的安定與和平的强國。在國際經濟上一向處着領導的地位。這一次三國的貨幣休戰和合作。可以增强他們原有的領導地位。也就可以鞏固現世界的安定與和平的勢力。這對於那些要求着重新分割世界的野心國家。總該是一個不小的打擊罷。我國跟英美有着貨幣上經濟上密切的聯繫。又處着現在這樣的境地。那麼。從大局着想。英美法貨幣協定究竟於我國有利與否。豈不是很容易明白的。</p>

<h3>衆院討論情形</h3>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院淤午後繼續開會、討論貨幣法案、最初發言者、為急進社會黨衆議員前財長龐萊、龐萊謂、應注意貨幣貶値一事、對於中產階級所可發生之反響、且謂社會秩序、當力加維持、雖費任何代價、亦所不恤、蓋必如是、方可使逃亡國外之法國資本、重回法國也、龐萊批評薪資依物價纍進之辦法、謂此種辦法、足使物價繼續上漲、其結果將使貨幣改革、歸於失敗云、</p>
<p>繼由前財長萊諾發表演說、萊諾對於金融問題、具有最高權威、故其言極為一般人所注意、渠對於貨幣貶値之原則、竭力表示贊成、但謂「所可惜者、此舉已嫌太遲、法蘭西銀行今已損失存金三百萬萬法郞矣、貨幣貶値、已成為普遍全世界之現象、今日欲覓一國家尙未貶低幣値者、已戞戞乎其難、今茲法國貶低幣値、自屬理所當然、惟政府曩時發表宣言每稱不欲貶低幣値、則吾人不能不為政府責耳、抑新貨幣法案頒佈以後、最近四個月來、舉國不寗之空氣、自可完全轉變、但政府若僅出此一舉、猶為未足、同時尤必須撙節政費、平衡預算、而後有濟、吾國貨幣、今與英美兩大工商國家、並駕齊驅、誠屬為計之得、然嗣後吾入尤必須設法使英美法三國生活於相同之經濟氣候而後可、以故流出國外之資金、須設法收回、大批失業者、須設法安揷、凡此均非左派或右派之貨幣貶値政策所能辦到者也、抑貨幣貶値、一舉而收成效、賊屬國利民福、然行之而不善、則勢非繼續貶值　不可、其禍患乃不堪設想矣、政府諸公、今當向勞工階級坦白宣言、承認過去試騐之失敗、正與通貨緊縮政策失敗之情形相同、夫如是、則勞工階級必能見諒、而加政府以信任矣、蓋世界未有經濟破產之國家、而勞工階級獨能幸福者也、就已往之經騐、世界各國、採取貨幣貶値政策、類皆獲得成效、今後之法國、是否將成為因採行貨幣貶値政策、而遭失敗之唯一國家乎、吾人敢以此一問題、質諸政府諸公」、</p>
<p>萊諾語畢、卽由財長奧利沃爾起而答辯、奧利沃爾首就經濟方面、陳述意大利英國美國相繼貶低幣値以後、世界物價已降落至大戰前之水準以下、因此生產與消費、兩者不能、諧和、此為經濟恐慌之一主因、結果所至、法國財政極度困難、本年初期、前內閣財長雷尼哀乃不得不向倫敦舉債、抑經濟恐慌、非僅法國為然、全世界各國無不深受痛苦、因此自一九三三年以來、各國曾迭次盡力、以期成立國際經濟協定、此種國際合作之辦法、全世界人士、無不引頸盼待、時歷數年、至最近而始有成、至就法國目前財政情形而論、政府在法蘭西銀行存欵、尙達八十萬萬法郞之鉅數、可見貶低幣値一舉、並非由於財政困難之所致、奧利沃爾繼復力稱、英美法三國發表關於貨幣恊定共同宣言之重要、謂「法國政府、今可保證法郞貶値以後、英鎊美元匯率决不受其影響、各國亦决不至因法郞貶値、而對法國施以關稅報復政策、由是可見英法美三國合作、實可謂完全做到矣、且此次法郞貶値之成分、係根據世界物價平準而决定、故國內物價、斷不至受其影響而抬高、此與通貨膨脹政策之足以影響國內物價者、自屬不同、法國於大戰後、受通貨膨脹之毒害至深、至一九二六年、始由故普恩加賚總理貶低幣値、穩定匯率、然當時遏抑投機、整理金融、慘澹經營、至一九二八年以後、方獲覩成效、今政府自亦當依照當時辦法、切實處置、而决不令投機商人因以獲利」云、</p>
<p>奧利沃爾演說畢、衆院乃延會至晚間復開、延會時期內、衆院左派各黨團開會、决定將貨幣法案中、關於薪資依物價　纍進之一節、加以刪除、典產黨及總工會方面均　同意删除、該節而代以另一節、規定「國會授權政府、維持法郞在國內之購買力、或禁止不正當抬高物價、或用其他方法、則由政府决定之、」此節經刪改後、貨幣法案、在國會通過、自將益見順利、</p>
<p>晚間九時三十五分、衆院繼續開會、最初僅由不甚重要之議員數人發言對於政府法案之批評、除日間龐萊及萊諾所述者外、並未有所增加、次由右派議員羅朗發言、謂政府向英美兩國所獲得之保證、殊有未足、且英美兩國貨幣亦未穩定、故殊不足恃云、左派共和黨議員戴利埃、則慮及貨幣法案對於農民所淹生之反饗、至是急進社會黨議員雷多爾忿而起言、謂「如是則令法國之眞正主人、二百家富戶出錢可也、」（按二百家富戶、係指法蘭西銀行大股東二百人、）至是全塲譁噪、議畏不得已乃宜佈休息片刻、</p>
<p>至十一點十分、衆院繼續開會、由共產黨議員杜格羅發言、謂「法郞貶値、共產黨並未受其恩惠、然共產黨亦不加以反對」云、至發雷時為止、衆院辯論猶未終止、大約貨幣法案、當可於深宵或淸晨提付表决、預料表决結果、必以大多數通過、所得贊成票數、當與本年六月以來政府迭次在眾院所得票數、相差不多、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）萊翁勃倫總理曾親自登壙發表長篇演說、為此項條文作辯護、並將政府現行貨幣與一般政策之理由、加以說明、其言曰、「關於貨幣問題、余（總理自稱）與財長奧利沃爾、曾受若干方面之壓迫、此輩所要求者、卽余等當於登台秉政之後、立卽貶低幣値、其主要理由、係謂國庫方面、刻正遭遇最嚴重之困難、一旦實行貶低幣値、則二百五十萬萬法郞之巨欵、可以立致、余與財長對於此項意見、初未接受、而仍賡續努力、以從事於經濟復興之大業、今茲雖不得已而採行新貨幣政策、但余並不引以為羞、須知美國羅斯福總統關於復興該國經濟一事、亦在歷經試探之後、始乃覓獲滿意方法、何况余對過去所為、並不承認錯誤歟」、</p>

<h3>蘇省府决於本年內　着手開闢新運河　現已測量竣事款項籌劃中　組墾區管理會着手改進棉業</h3>
<p>（鎭江通訊、）蘇省常局開發蘇北鹽墾區問題、前經邀請滬銀行實業兩界人土、前往觀光、幷一面實施墾區新運河綫之測量、現測量工作、業經竣事、此後墾區工作、將愈臻具體化、現蘇省方面、正從事計劃籌欵、作新運河之開闢、及棉業改進之用途、茲將最近所得各情、彙誌如次、</p>
<p>新運河綫測量竣事</p>
<p>蘇省府為繁榮蘇北、開發墾區、振興商業、救濟農村起見、遂决定在裏運河之東、另闢新河綫、自南通起向北至灌雲陳家港口、並組織測量總隊、委徐南騶為總隊長、率領技術人員等、前往勘定新河綫後、於今年春三月間出發實施測量、經半載之努力、現已測量竣事、刻該隊正着手設計及繪製圖表等工作，約一二月卽可設計完成，開闢問題、本年度內可實現、經費約需千餘萬元、現由省府通盤籌劃中、</p>
<p>將設墾區管理委會</p>
<p>蘇省府為開發墾區、决先從改進棉業、開拓棉田着手、故於南通設立江蘇省棉產改進處、辦理棉作育種及其他種種工作、另一方面則積極籌劃完成新運河工程、俾便推進農田之開發、惟是墾區地域遼闊、若不集中人力與財力、自難收發展推進之效、現擬于墾區內、設一濱海墾區管理委員會、隸屬省府直轄、其組織方面、設委員長副委員長各一人、（其人選正委員長有由沈建廳長兼任說、）委員會之下、設秘書一人、及總務墾殖經濟三處、遴選專門人才充任、此項計劃、省當局已在審議、聞將來如果實現墾殖設計委員會、卽將歸併於墾殖處、以期集中力量、統籌辦理云、</p>
<p>省府撥款改進棉業</p>
<p>本省棉墾區墾熟棉田已達一千三百餘萬畝、尙未墾植者有六百餘萬畝、省府前為積極發展棉業、曾邀請銀行界前往視察、幷請儘量投資、現此項問題、尙在商洽中、據農管會副委長曹濟寬談、現省府鑒於發展棉業為刻不容緩之事、决定先撥十萬元、以作本年度棉業改進之用、共詳細支配辦法、已飭由改進處編擬中、其改進辦法、先從調查出產登記着手、茲値棉產成熟、各處均已檢收、今年收成尙佳、現農業管理委員會卽將舉辦登記事宜、從事第一步改進工作云、</p>
<p>蘇省棉業改進方針</p>
<p>關於開闢墾區改進棉業各點旣如上述、其改進棉業方針如左、（一）改良棉種、改進棉業、以提高品質、並增加產量為目的、故對於中棉應注意其絨質之改良、衣分之提高及種性之純化、對於美棉、應注意其原有改性之維持、成熟期之提早、並增進其抗鹽力及棉鈴抗雨之能力（二）防蟲除害、棉蟲之種類旣多、而其為害之狀况、又隨季節地域品種及栽培方法之互異而各有不同、亟應設法防除以期减少棉農損失、（三）改良鹽地、蘇北鹽墾區域面積甚廣、但因所含鹽分太高、不宜於作物之生長、遂自成為曠士、擬研究改良、俾棉作得以適宜生長、以增土產、（四）革除積習、我國棉農對於棉花旣有攙水攙雜之惡習、而棉商對於花價又有遏折操縱之積弊、以致棉花品質無由提高、誠篤之棉農、亦因其所產優良棉花不能得相當之待價、而相率效尤、此等積習、務須設法革除、以期改進、</p>

<h3>日本人財政資金覦中的大珊礁</h3>
<p>— 澳洲　Nettie　Palmer作　不忍譯</p>
<p>新近，因為常常有日本船隻出現在澳洲北部的洋面，常常有日本人在素來無人過問的澳洲大陸岸邊登陸，澳大利亞政府已感覺到嚴重的不安。燈塔的守望人報吿這等日本人纍次闖入，在靜僻的港灣中紥營野宿的假期旅行者也目擊大批日本人登岸搜尋食物。</p>
<p>當然，在那些常期捕捉凹螺與海參的人們看來，這批從隔海到來的日本人是搶奪他們的生意的勁敵；他們要求政府設法制止，自然是意中事。</p>
<p>日本人也是為搜集凹螺而來的。他們的到來勢必引起一種頗難解决的國際糾紛。問題的癥結，在於大珊礁（The　Great　Barrier　Reef）。大珊礁是島嶼，砂灘，珊瑚礁的混合物，包圍着澳大利亞聯邦之一的苦因士蘭（Queensland）的沿岸，長約一千二百哩，形成太平洋岸的防波堤。大珊礁和大陸岸邊的距離，長短不一，有達二十哩的，有達五十哩的。被包圍在這裏面的，是一片平靜的海洋，通常是被認為澳大利亞的領海的。</p>
<p>可是，這傳統的所有權却因日本人的闖入而成問題了。因為日本人從早就羨慕着大珊礁洋面的豐饒和海產的價値，現在他們已開始進攻了。</p>
<p>舉例說，這裏產生着凹螺的貝殼。每年有一百五十萬磅凹螺貝從大珊礁輸出，大部分是運到日本去的。這是一種粗鬆而易於磨製的貝殼。因為日本人獲得這種廉價的原料，而且因為在日本人的家庭中通常都自備磨貝殼的機械，所以在螺鈿鈕市塲上日本人巳打倒了以高價珠貝為螺鈿原料的歐美人。</p>
<p>日本人向大珊礁進侵的最重要的目的，是要刦奪製造鈕扣的原料——就是凹螺的貝毅。他們實行闖入的通常方法，是把母船泊在大珊礁的外岸，將小船從狹流駛入內部洋面。</p>
<p>我和我的丈夫紮營野宿在大珊礁的一個小島上，快近一年了，所以我很懂得管理這些洋面的因難，以及就地船夫們對於隔海闖入者的態度。我們居留着的小烏是沿襯大珊礁的環狀珊瑚島之一。</p>
<p>這小鳥純粹由珊瑚構成，廣約四十畝，島上却也有繁茂的叢林。島的週圍是一片淺沼，被不規則形式的礁岸包圍着，低潮時露出崎嶇的礁面，這上面我們有時步行至數哩之遠。這是一處理想的瞭望地，在這裏我們可以幽開地老察大珊礁的構造，同時可以熟識大珊礁居民的水上生活。</p>
<p>對於初來者，大珊礁確是一個奇蹟。起初，我們設想大珊礁不過是一座沿靠海岸形若堡壘的速續的珊瑚壁，經過實地的察看，我們纔知道它是由許多發達程度不同的珊瑚體構成的複雜的堡壘，有在高潮時露出的珊瑚礁，有完全高出水面的珊瑚礁，有載砂披草的陳礁，又有和平常相同的長生着美麗的林木的礁灘。僅在短短的一天航行中，這種種都給我們看到了。</p>
<p>我們所看到的生人，大抵是大陸的漁夫和住在島上的船夫。在最近五十年中，大珊礁洋面的航海業頗呈進展。此項事業的大本營所在地是托列斯海峽（TorresStrait）中的星期四島（Thursday　Island），那裏有大批的淺水漁船給製造出賣。這些漁船大抵為澳大利亞人所有，由土民操作，而船長則多數為日本人。</p>
<p>每年三月間，到了多雨的旋風季節的末期，這些漁船從南部出發，受貿易風的飄送逐漸向北移動，到了適宜的地點便停泊一星期光景，派遺小船去撈摸凹螺，海參，和蛛貝之類的海產。他們的動作是受澳大利亞政府的監督的：珊瑚礁本身固然不許毀壞分毫，捕捉底徑不滿二吋半的螺貝亦在被禁之列。此項監督趁相當容易的，因為這些漁船所搜築的海產都須經過星期四島，在那里裝船輸出。</p>
<p>除開工業上的價値，大珊礁是一般土民—不論住在大陸或島上—的謀生所在地。潛水撈摸，好像是他們的一種天生的本領，正和原始人狩獵為生相同。</p>
<p>我還記得我初次看到到我們島上來的一羣船夫時的情景。他們的小船恰巧泊在礁外。</p>
<p>「你們的船是誰所有的！」我問，我的眼睛注視着那小船。</p>
<p>他們之中的一個誇傲地搖一搖頭。</p>
<p>「我們的船不是別人所有，是我們自己所有。」</p>
<p>後來我知道，在他們的島——巴度島（Badu　Island）—上，苦因士關政府在最近若干年中巳施行，一種合作制度，就是：政府貸欵給土民，呌他們自備船隻，搜集的海產歸政府收買。這制度好像頗著成效，因為那些土民的生活標準已比從前提高不少了。</p>
<p>大珊礁的船夫們眞是可愛的人羣！他們大抵是混血種。他們來自托列斯海峽（這原是不同民族的接觸地）中的島嶼，從而貌上我們可以猜知他們的祖先有馬來人，有坡里內西亞人，有美拉尼西亞人，也有澳洲大陸的土著。不論他們的來源怎樣，他們都一般地熱愛大珊礁，以大珊礁的居民自誇。從他們的歌唱中，我們領略到他們的誇傲的心情。當他們上陸遊散時，呌他們走到我們的為帳裏面歌唱一回，並不是難事啦。</p>
<p>他們唱的通常是簡單而重複的抒情歌，有自己編造的，也有摹仿別地方的曲調的。這些歌詞大抵是描摹他們自己的海上生活和他們所碰到的風暴及其他危難。他們也常常舉行祝宴，大家且歌且舞，合成又雄偉又滑稽的集團表演。</p>
<p>逐漸逐漸的，這世外桃源的大珊礁洋面已開始被就地謀生的人們以外的世人所注意了。每逢多陽光的冬季，常有從嚴寒的南部過來的旅行者到這里來遊歷；在棕櫚叢林中，巳有以數給旅客安身的屋宇建造起來了。</p>
<p>不多幾年前，以楊奇博士（Dr．C；M；Yonge）為領袖的英國自然科學研究旅行團會到過離我們的小島北首約四十哩的勞胡台島（LowWoody　Island）；他們是為考察海洋浮遊動植物）鯨魚的食物）的性質及研究珊瑚問題而來的。</p>
<p>據新近報吿，另外一個科學研究旅行團又將到來。關於珊瑚成長的問題，原來很多，大珊瑚的島嶼不啻是研究這些問題的天然實騐室啦。</p>
<p>可是，除與科學問題發生關係外，大珊礁又是勢必引起糾紛的政治問　的一個主體。介於大珊礁與大陸之間的洋面是否應被認為澳大利亞的領土？日本人的闖入，是否一種偷竊行為？在不久的將來，這些問題就要提供於世人吧。</p>

<h3>本市禁烟入新階段　華界收得極大效果　租界正待繼續磋商</h3>
<p>中央社云、本市烟民登記業已結束、中央所派來滬辦理登記檢舉、之專員馬亮氏、亦以使命已告終了、卽將離滬晋京復命、故本市禁烟事宜、現將進入新階段、中央社記者、特往訪馬專員、叩詢關於過去辦理登記烟民惰形、及今後辦理禁烟辦法、茲將探悉各情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>過去烟民登記</p>
<p>馬專員首述、過去烟民登記情形、略謂、在過去之檢舉期內、其在期前已經登記領取執照而已期滿、前往市公安局換取執照者、計有一萬九千餘人、在檢舉期內、補請登記者、計有二萬四千餘人、業已戒絕姻癮者、計有一萬一千餘人、已離本市及死亡者計有一千餘人、此乃數月來歷經調查所得之情形也、</p>
<p>檢舉工作三月</p>
<p>專員辦公處自五月初成立以來、經將近一個月之準備工作及一個月之結束工作、實際上所努力之檢舉工作者、不過三月而已、幸常地官廳及領袖之隨時恊助、故在華界已收取極大效果、卽在租界方面、亦已得有相當之效果、現在該處結束已辦理完竣、馬氏將于日內離滬、晋京晋謁蔣總監、報吿在滬辦理檢舉烟民登記情形、馬氏對本市地方領袖熱烈協助、辦理烟政、表示感謝、對新聞界隨時宜揚政府對禁烟之本旨、亦表示謝意、</p>
<p>租界禁烟問題</p>
<p>馬氏復述及此次在滬辦理租界禁烟交涉之經過、略謂、本市為華洋雜處、故辦理禁烟事宜、不無困難、在華界方面、一律按照中央法令進行禁政、但因租界方面、難於推行、使本市禁政、殊受影響、故本人對於此事、殊屬關心、本市會擬具意見、條陳總部、請向領團交涉、總部當卽咨請行政院、交由外交部辦、但外部方面、因以外交手續辦理頗費周折、仍請由地方政府、直接向領團交涉、爰經總部令復本人、本人卽經與市府秘書長俞鴻鈞氏、數度洽商、嘗由俞秘書長與租界當局、開始交換意見、而本市地方領袖王曉籟·杜月笙·虞洽卿·等諸氏、亦經向租界當局建議、初以租界當局、對於我國禁政、不甚瞭解、愛經各方一再申述我國政府禁烟之决心、幷解釋進行禁烟之步驟現在已能完全暸解、但為手續上之關係、將來似當繼續磋商、確定具體辦法、能與華界取同一辦法以推進、則將來在本市禁烟事宜、更可收取宏效、</p>
<p>一萬餘人戒烟</p>
<p>馬氏最後談及今後之烟政、謂本市烟民、為數不少、現巳有一萬餘人戒去烟癮、而本市禁烟醫院、仍繼績積極辦理戒烟工作、以目前情形論、每月可戒除者約一千餘人、但一般已經戒除之烟民、若不予妥善之處置、恐仍有再犯之可能、故本人認為應設法設立烟民工廠、或其他生產機關、一則能使已戒癮之烟民、得有條理之管理及監督、二則可使從事生產事業、且本市租界方面、如能按照我國法令進行、則烟政又較繁瑣、况一切交涉、尙待繼續進行、故將來另由總部派員赴各省市常川主持禁政、靜俟總部研究、本人赴京、卽將滬地情形報吿後、幷將出席全國禁烟會、此次會議中、有將今後禁烟事宜、加以討論、陳候總監决定、</p>
<h3>三行運現赴粵　充實毫劵準備　全國幣制統一從此卽可完成　三國貨幣協定匯兌影響减少</h3>
<p>中央社云、日來外間暄稱、中中交三行、運現赴粵、記者特往中央銀行、訪晤負責當局、探詢究竟？據稱、粵省幣制、業經中央整理、所有該省以前發行之毫券、總額為二萬四千九百餘萬元、其六成現金準備部分不足之數、為百分之十七强、現由財部向中中交三行、如數商借、陸續運粵補足、此後粵省毫券準備、現經依法充實、全國幣制統一、卽可完成該省財政經濟、自必日趨良好、而法幣推行、亦必日見增加、三行有鑒於此、並擬續運現金、為增加發行準備之用、談次、記者復詢以英美法三國貨幣協定問題、當承答稱、此次英法美三國訂立貨幣協定、以鞏固歐美列强之幣制、使物價趨於一致之平衡、而促成經濟上之合作、從此英美金與法郎之比價、賴以穩定、我國法幣與外匯關係密切、英美匯兌尤占重要、現三國貨幣旣經協定、法幣匯價、當益趨平穩、而匯兌變動影響自益减少也云云、</p>

<p>（一）便宜心　占便宜，是不論男女，共同所有的不良心理，金錢是應當愛惜的，貨色是要揀便宜的，但是便宜的對面是吃虧，便宜和吃虧是成等比例的，換句話說，便是便宜是和吃虧相等的。假使便宜和吃虧不相等，便是不便宜我們知道國貨運動和主婦，有密切的關係，而女人的便宜心，却是比男子來得厲害，所以她們看到花樣又新奇，又時式，價格又廉的貸色，終是不辨是否國貨？隨手就買，奸商利用她們的便宜心，取得金錢，於是金錢外溢，不可勝數，其實在這種不良心理，危害國民生計太烈，可說甚於入超的指數，須知道，你貪了一些便宜，吃了經濟侵略的大虧，成了個反比例，這倒是小事，還要受敵人砲火炸彈的賜予！豈不是大大的不便宜了嗎？所以鄙人敬以掬誠，勸吿一般存便宜心者，為國計民生前途計；為國貨運動計，不願為奴隸的話，誓死剷除，痛改這種不良心理的便宜心，主婦們！你們尤當有則改之，無則加勉呢！</p>
<p>（二）遷就心　凡事不可遷就，國貨更是不可，一個人遷就慣了，就要馬虎從事，而况乎現在私貨充斥，魚目混珠，假使你也遷就些吧！管他娘是國貨不是！買了便算了，須知你這樣一遝就，就糟了！老實說，偌大的中國，也可以在這「遷就」兩字上送掉！遷就就是不負國民的天職，不盡國家的義務，須知「天下興亡，匹夫有責」，採用國貨，不買非國貨，旣然是國防政策之一，就人人要做到，主婦們的因遷就而買非國貨，在目下敎育，知識不普及的中國，不知凡幾，此點果希望有知識的主婦，非但要自勵，並且要宣傳，勸吿別的主婦，况且父母雖同是兒童模範，但以母性為占重要地位，仔細考查起來，主婦同兒童的躑躅於洋貨的玩具攤，店，前，而、遷就購買，以滿足兒童的童心慾的為多數，這豈不是害及見童的將來，未免也有「遷就」的不良心理作用嗎？此種影響，在無形中擴張牠的勢力，實在是防不勝防呢！以上二種，說來很是簡單，又是人人知道而威覺到的，但是往往耳染目濡般很容易犯規的，非把國貨的基礎打好不行。希望主婦們注意及之。</p>

<h3>市商會之國貨展覽會獻詞</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>上海市商會為商品陳列所十五周紀念，特於靜安寺路國際飯店舉行大規模之國貨展覽會，參加廠商一百五十餘家，定於十月一日開幕。以正當之工商集團在此國難嚴重時期，舉行此盛大之集會、其意義至為重大。吾人於歡欣之餘，特提出三點，以告滬人士與主持是會之諸君子。</p>
<p>（一）以進步之眼光觀察此會此會之出品，較諸已往數屆之展覽會，進步甚速，有數種出品，向無國產，今日居然陳列於大會會塲，漸漸由仰給舶來品之過程中，達到自足自給之境界。雖以物力才力財力之關係，猶未臻十分美備之域，顧平心而論，國貨界能於千辛萬苦之中，奮鬥掙扎，以造成此種成績，似屬不易。苟再假以歲月，一方厚集人才，為技術上之改進，一方接濟金融，謀實力上之充足其造就更無限量，此其一。</p>
<p>（二）以忠實之批評促國貨之改進是會於展覽以後，聞將訂請專家，從事審查，以為獎勵之準備，吾人認為少數人之批評，不如多數人之批評。苟以大衆之目光，何者為優，何者為次，何者應改良，何者應變更，希望到會諸君子予以忠實之批評，以供各廠改進之參考，此則關係促進工業之進步甚大，願滬人土注意及之。</p>
<p>（三）以愛護之心理盡力為國產推銷　吾人目睹國貸界有如許之出品，如許之進步，當極為欣慰，萬一有不甚滿意之處，亦當予以原諒，處處以愛護國貨之心理，為之盡力推銷，廣開出路。認定救國之首要，在提倡國貨，對於出品者處處當存敬愛之態度，予以長足之進步，充分之發展而後始完成國民之天職。凡此三點，在國貨界本身，亦應明瞭自身責任之重大，精益求精，力求優美，以與外貨相周旋，則此會之舉行，更饒意義矣。</p>
<h3>中秋與國貨</h3>
<p>— 淸波</p>
<p>時針像一隻空際的飛鳥，轉瞬就會飛去，終於沒有影縱的消逝。</p>
<p>回憶靑年的秋節，好像還在目前，而今年中秋，却又很快的在一剎那之間，重復降臨了。時光這樣迅速的駛去，實在給我們年靑人以無限的感觸。</p>
<p>這幾天，我們假如有空暇的工夫，到各馬路去逛逛的話。那末，你準可以看到許許多多的人們，在各大公司中擁進擁出，手裏都拿了一紮紮一包包的束西，這些人所忙何來？究竟忙些什麼？作者着實莫明其妙，繼而一想：對了！對了！過幾天便是中秋佳節，人是富有理智感惰的動物，以他們怎能不辦些東西，送給可親可愛的親戚朋友，來表示一下雙方的友誼親情呢？</p>
<p>的確，「每逢佳節倍思親！為了生活而流浪在外面的兒子，在這中秋行將降臨的現在，誠然應該採辦一些東西，拿回家去以娛親情，以慰嬌妻幼子，這也是人情之常，我們能予他絲毫的非議嗎？</p>
<p>不過，採辦禮節的同胞們：我們要知道，現在是什麼時代？我們的經濟國難，現在是嚴重到什麼地步？外貨的侵略，私貨的猖獗，更是如何嚴重的一伴事？當我們在採辦禮節，和一切用品的時候，應該牢牢的記住「國貨」兩個大宇，無論吃的，用的，穿的，無論送人的，自用的，無論如何，都應該以採購國貨為標準，任你外國貨怎樣美麗？怎樣價廉？我們要抱定中心，誓不與之行携手禮，唯有這樣，咱們的經濟國難，才有解救的一天，唯有如此，外貨的侵略，以及私貨的猖獗，才有沒落的可能，這是全國同胞在採辦中秋節禮的時候，所應該深深認識淸楚的一點</p>
<p>最後，作者還有一些意見，要附帶貢獻，便是當這舉國同胞提倡國貨，十分熱烈的當兒，我們以禮物送人，尤其要注意到：「這是不是國貨？」一個問題，因為我們拿國貨的禮物，來贈給人家，一方面固然是尊重對方，同時，也是尊重自己；反之，我們假如拿舶來品來贈送親友，無異侮辱對方的人格，同時，也是侮辱了目己的人格。碰着頂眞的朋友，恐怕還要原封不動的退還給你，寫上一張紙條兒，來敎訓你一番，到了那個時候，試問：這還有什麼趣味呢？</p>
<p>忙着採辦中秋節禮的仕女們，請你們把我的意見，組細的考量一下吧！</p>

<h3>世運選手團隨征記　第十六信　中央社特派員馮有眞寄</h3>
<p>參加大會的我國選手團、除足球隊因應邀於十二日先離柏林、到佛朗克福城Frankfort比賽、然後再　奧瑞英法等國比賽外、體育攷察團團員於大會閉幕後的第二天晚十、也離德赴奧瑞芬蘭丹麥等國攷察、其餘選手都留居柏林、十七日正　駐德大使程大放假藍白網球會設宴餞別、十八日旅歐中國學生聯合總會在柏林東郊巴德薩羅Bal　Saarow（離柏林六十五公里）、舉行第二屆年會開慕禮、全體選手均往參加、籃球及游泳選手並參加表演、戴院長於卽午歡宴全體選手、卽晚仍回柏林輿林匹免新村、到十八日停止招待、男女選手都遷居市內、分別寄宿在旅館裏、自二十四日起至二十六日止、分組參觀國社黨黨軍、靑年組織、義務勞働隊、勞働組織、市政著名工廠、國家汽車道、及社會救濟事業、二十九日起自由行動、九月一日夜九時十三分由柏林乘專車一節離德、過奧赴義、德政府代表及留學生到車站歡送者、約百餘人、預計三日晨到那不勒斯Naples四日乘康特盧梭輪首途、大約月底就可回到祖國了、</p>
<p>政府代表戴院長、因為另有任務、不能與選手團同行、預定九月中旬由法乘輸於雙—節前趕回京都、總領隊王正延會赴蘇聯波蘭奧國等國作短期間的攷察、預定四日在那不勒斯與選手團同輪歸國、總幹事沈嗣良因事巳於八月二十一日已由西比利亞先行、總敎練馬約翰籃球敎練董守義、仍留居柏林、預定在歐洲各國及美國攷察體育、歸國之期、當在一年之後、體育攷察團團員江良規灤仙渠、及選手賈連仁、均留德研究體育、記者因參觀歐洲新聞事業、亦擬勾留數月、「隨征記」於此吿一結束、歐行如有所得、當再向讀者另為報吿、</p>
<p>（七）（七）旅歐學生總會年會</p>
<p>在結束「隨征記」以前、關於「旅歐中國學生聯合總會」第二次年會的情形、應該向讀者作一個詳細的報吿、因為旅歐的學生、這次對選手團帮了很多的忙、可以說是選手團出征中重要工作的一員、再則關於留學生的情形、想來也必為讀者所關心、</p>
<p>學生總會之沿革</p>
<p>我國派遺靑年學生到外國留學的歷史、與日本是同樣的悠久、日本留學生的努力、完成明治維新的大業、現在已稱羈全球、我國留學生對祖國雖也有過很多的貢獻、但是不但不能與日本相提並論、且與國人的期望、相去甚遠、原因所在大約不外兩點、第一是政府與留學生間沒有密切的聯擊、往往政府需要人材、而找不到人材、同時具有專門學識的學生、回國後父幷往沒有貢獻其才學的機會、形成一種矛盾的現象、第二是留學生間派別分歧，門戶之兒甚深、不但不能分工合作、而且互相排擠、我們要想使留學生對國家眞能有所貢獻、非把這兩種缺陷消滅、是永遠沒有希望的、在歐洲各國留學的學生、有很多國家是早就有學生會的祖織的、近年來他們感覺有把這種小的組織擴大、有使全歐洲留學生的情感與知識熔冶的必要、由英法荷三國學生會的發起、於一九三四年八月在倫敦舉行「旅歐中國學生聯合總會」成立大會、通過會章、規定每年暑假期中、舉行年會一次、一九三五年八月在荷京亞摩斯德丹舉行第一次年會、本年因為世運大會之便、在德國舉行第二次年會、除英德荷三國代表、義奧兩國學生亦正式派代表出席、其餘法比瑞士波蘭等國、因尙無學生會的組織、祗有非正式的代表列席、此外參加的各國留學生、計共一百五六十人之多、第三屆年會定明年八月在倫敦舉行、預料各國均將有正式代表出席、使聯合總會的組織、益趨健全、</p>
<p>本屆年會之代表</p>
<p>本屆年會各國出席的正式代表、為德國陳介生黃遠晟、英國鄭康祺朱國洗、荷蘭陳建豐陳霞祥、義國石孝光陳家博、輿國徐衆齋黃正儉、總會職員如次、會長陳介生、副會長黃遠晟、秘書組黃　叅·陳體祥·魯翼晟·黃一球、西文編輯組林秋生·陶鵬飛·鄭　康祺·劉念禮·陳建豐、中文編輯組巫啟雲·韋永成·黃遠晟·于瑞人·王學禮·張家炎·劉伊農·朱國洗、體育組李國琛·朱尊誼·皮宗敬、總務兼交際江鴻·孫鑑·陶鵬飛、遊藝組居伯强魯克敏、</p>

<h3>糧食　麺粉交割不待到期</h3>
<p>昨為九月份期紛交割·惟在交易所無正式履行、因交割改為公棧後、手續不便、費用亦暗中加增、故雙方對手、如客戶竟欲抽裝、早向廠方接洽、反之如廠方有餘額未了、凡經手之掮客、亦向客戶兜售、是以在現狀態之下、非至不得已時、方有正式交割云、</p>
<h3>雜糧交割數亦可觀</h3>
<p>昨日離糧交易、全日小麥交割計廿六車、由四號交六車、　號交一車、六號交二車、十號交二車、十二號交　車、十六號交一車、廿六號交三車、廿七號交二車、卅八號交六車、收進者由十一號收四車、廿三號收二車、卅六號志誠永則獨收廿車、標油交割、亦頗暢旺、計六號交四千四　　　交　　　　　號交　千四　　、收　者　　號收　　　　　、　　號收八百　　　號收一百　、　　五號收四千三百担、餘則未　交割云、</p>
<h3>客糙秈粵帮仍暢辦</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到銷兩旺、市氣極佳、尤以糙秈為粵帮暢辦、而存　兩少、市乃續見俏漲、昨日粵帮辦去各路糙米七八千包、價比前市又漲一角半左右、其他機　則由本街與汕帮暢辦、市價亦見微俏、統市開出江西米六千八百五十包、湘米五千三百五十包、南京糙三百包、漢糙三千五百包云、</p>
<p>中秋節屆食米滯銷</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十八九號、貨共近四千石、西街銷塲因挨節關係、仍見清淡、故如百哥窰種等新薄稻、包胃雖有青島大連兩帮辦三百餘包、而結果行情又小一角至角半、厚新粳價亦跟落一角、杜洋等各色新尖、來源續稀、市氣猶定、破　厚者無上落、薄稻青島帮包胃僅辦百數十包、市迺呈定中帶軟之勢、陳陰變元來源絕無、新陰元供過於求、見跌角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到貨二十餘號、市上各貨銷胃破粳·變元·陳薄稻·交呆、西新粳·新羊杜埠客尖頗佳、市價破粳·變元·陳薄稻·價疲幾分至近角、新粳·新羊杜埠客尖帶緊數分、東新粳定局窰中疲軟、百哥跌小一　角、今日為中秋節、照列南北市米業均停斛一天、</p>
<h3>絲茶　國內絲市更覺沉靜</h3>
<p>昨日紐約絲市、中日生絲持價均趨軟化、計除廣東絲外、各下跌一分、交易所行盤、近期十二　　　　　　半、　遠期　月份未有變動、　　　市、則因潔柔郎多　、　　停頓、生絲自無交易、　昨日未有行市、橫濱現期貨微升六元至九元、下午又見堅挺、然本埠絲市　覺寂靜、洋　　　、亦漸停頓、國內用戶囤戶、更因時局不　、亦少進出、全日絲交僅五十六包、今日秋節、洋商亦有循例休假、國內絲市、或將更覺清淡云、</p>
<p>針眉綠茶　銷亦旺</p>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶市况、繼續暢旺、浙省　水　茶、及路莊珍眉綠茶、因英莊怡和洋行首先策動、其他行家、均先後開辦、卽針眉綠茶協和洋行、亦大量吸收、全市成交綠茶、共計三千二百餘箱、售　均趨穩定、至紅茶市面、滬市將告結束、聞洋行方面、尚擬往神州兩湖等處、繼續　辦云、</p>
<p>又據茶棧業報告云、綠茶市因受法貶值影響、日前所發摩洛哥之電報、均無轉音所以市面非常清靜、惟各行前所談之平水珍眉及路莊秀眉等、昨均正式成交、觀市面以法郎關係、恐一時難望發展云、</p>

<h3>中秋誌感</h3>
<p>— （叔範）</p>
<p>白水青蘆渺渺愁，不關江上哭靈修，　虫清苦商船穩，一律凉燈泊過秋！</p>
<p>江湖就食，最怕中秋，客子今宵，奚以遣此？詩成悵惘輒勿勝任。人生三十，論其精壯，猶秋之方中，月之垂滿，以之赴社會家國，未始無稍裨益；然而舉足蹭蹬，莫當要路，遂使日夕周旋於酒杯飯甑之間，如恐不及。年年月明，我猶爾爾，何必桓司馬摩挲秋柳始與感耶？</p>
<p>青冥矅素，浮雲來犯，即目懷警，又無怪澤畔靈均有眾醉獨醒之　也。故月明有意，雲郤無情，以之例人，遽欲以清端不偏之操，感導也俗，　乎難矣。所可快者，凉風吹去，固猶通明，陰晦萬變，不損於月；此所以特立獨行之士，皎皎若懷，雖歷窒阻，而無悔者歟？吾於中秋，忽思所立。</p>
<p>月到中秋分外明。此冒辟疆所以謂為最清最幽者也。在辟疆祇恐月華秋露，消受無多；而尋人即景生感，則有異已。幾家歡樂，幾家悲愁，此兒女之思也。凉燈飛夢，秋戍如何？此壯士所感也。『自憐樹底婆娑影，誰漆人間突千元頭』？此英雄欲蹈死疆場，而無由者也。今年今宵，秋思誰多？看招手雲端，意會各如何爾！</p>
<h3>到月裏去</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>月球，亦行星之一；然則係整個之實體。並非虛構之一幻像，而時值秋中，其光若分外明者，何耶？因月球亦有盈缺，一月必兩次會日於同一子午圈，其間所歷之時，即謂之『朔望』；約二十九日十二時四十四分二秒八七，緣視徑大小不一，且以軌道為橢圓，故人望月有如一鉤，或形若半輸，漸至嵌若明鏡，而一年之月無不以今宵為多，而舊俗值此中秋夜，咸以大好之月光，爭為欣賞，然所謂遊月宮，而揖姮娥者，其為荒誕不經，而渺無影響，可不俟言；故吾謂科學進步，一日千里，將來人類必有達到月球之一日，可預決爾。</p>
<p>試證之前美人孔召特技師，有『旅行金星』之發表，其後有維巴納好夫博士，發明火箭，『與月球通郵之消息，』近則有英人羅皮遜博士，『以無線電向火星直接呼喚，』準是以言，月球距地球本不甚遠，如以今之環遊旅行家比之，其所經之程途，有超過於由地球以達月球之時間與距離者，則以後安和不聯袂共遊於月府耶？或云『不可，無論如何？吾人一至最高度，有一障礙在，即缺乏呼吸之清氣，勢必窒死，』尚能上昇乎？『吾曰無慮』，不聞化學家可以製造空氣乎？沿途如至真空界，必可將清氣滿載，隨之以行：如是，又何患不能不遊月球以實地試騐耶？</p>
<p>今人徒知拜月與賞月耳。吾謂不如仿科學家之研究，或者考察，或者游玩，不較勝於侷處彈丸之地球上，令人裏足不前乎？且以放射火箭言，據云「便捷直如一郵袋，譬之維也納至新西蘭，至需五十六分鐘，使至月球，則經過時間，至多亦僅一星期之久，已可達到目的地矣；或謂「此汝之夢想」耳，余曰，請觀空中之飛行，今何如乎？彼西哲　維林，非亦謂飛艇為痴人之幻想」耶？然豈料今日竟成航空之一世界哉？故吾以為將來吾人必有踐此一言，以爭往月球之一日；噫，今之燒斗香，但知看月以虛度良宵者，真愚之甚也已。</p>
<h3>月到中秋分外明</h3>

<h3>秋蟲秋月</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>游泳池裏不見那摩登男女在戲水；冷飲店也已卸下了招牌，改做別行生意；人行的水門汀路上，更不見窮漢們夜晚露宿着，這一切景象，已暗示給人們秋已到了。秋是肅殺的，秋是寂寞的，不少的騷人墨客，正在感嘆吟詠，做下了多少動人的詩文。其實秋何嘗使人寂寞，也何嘗損傷人絲毫汗毛，說秋是悲苦沒趣，真是無病呻吟。不信，您瞧許多有閒階級和許多布維爾喬亞，正在大玩其秋蟲，大嚼其秋月咧！</p>
<p>實在秋天的蟲類很多，像蟋蟀，紡織娘，金鈴子等，每逢夜深人靜，露滴寒侵的當兒，它們在階除庭砌中，在荳棚瓜架下，唧唧長鳴，聽了多少令人　　寡歡。不過蟋蟀長鳴之外，還能開着牙兒，同類相殘，是一個　武主義的實行家，因此給人們玩弄着，做着秋蟲的代表。人們把瓦盆蓄養着米粒喂飼着，似乎是愛惜備至：其實是借它的力量，博取自己的彩頭，鎧甲登場，燿武揚威，不過一個小傀儡而已</p>
<p>秋高氣爽，，晚間的月兒，似乎格外皎潔些。因愛賞明月而有月餅的發明，以「六書」諭例，這也屬於「會意」的一格。月餅的創始，無從查考，不過民間的傅說：元末的時候，漢人的家中，是有韃子——蒙古人——監視着。那時劉伯溫抱着種族革命思想，賄通餅肆，於　內夾着紙條，寫着：「我們漢人快起來殺盡韃子。」因此有吃月餅殺韃子的故事，足見月餅流傳已久了。不過現今的人類，不比古人的傻蠢；而且講着睦鄰主義的時候任你有萬分冤氣也祇好咽下肚去，所以月餅儘管咬嚼着，再不辨別那味道是酸是辣是苦是甜了。</p>
<h3>月到中秋分外明</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>十年以前的某一個中秋夜，我飄泊在某一個都市裏，度着凄凉寂寞的流浪生活。在一個小樓上，寫着一行一行的稿笺，室內是靜得像死了一般，除鋼筆尖劃在原稿紙上，發出那刷刷的聲音外，周遭竟聽不到一些別的響動。</p>
<p>雖然是一個都市，可是　國為住在市梢，所以環境十分幽靜，尤其是一到深夜，一切聲音和活動，都漸漸地歸於沉寂了。美孕燈的火熖慢慢的參淡下去，自己也好像感到了有點倦意，但只不能睡；那周遭的靜穆給予找一種可怕的威脅，使我沒有勇氣再坐下去。於是將燈捻熄了，把一個肢體投到了床上。</p>
<p>中秋，是一年中的佳節，在一些有興賞月的雅人，當然不曾錯過這良辰美景的，可是自家兒「舉頭看明月，低頭思故鄉」；在這樣一個月圓時節，還孤獨地飄流在異鄉，只眼巴巴的看着這抓不住的時光，偷偷地從找生活的影子裏溜了過去。「每逢佳節倍思親」，與念及此，不禁愴然淚下。</p>
<p>我突然地從床上走了起來，推出窗去，只看見皎皎的一片月色；然而一種哀愁已輕輕地　上了我的意識，使我對這皎潔的月光，彷佛有一腔委曲要待向訴聽說一樣。</p>
<p>在寫字臺上，舖下了張稿紙，將筆尖醮飽了墨水，借着遭月光，想寫點什麼；但是，但是我應該為點什麼好呢？</p>
<p>忽忽，到現在為止，又是幾個寂寞的中秋夜，在那流浪生涯的歲月中度了過去，然而由這個都市裏飄到那個都市裏；幾年來，只是人事倥傯，生活勞碌的自己沒有好好的停留在一處。而且，那失業的飢荒，又把我催上了這條久經遺忘的舊路！</p>
<p>一個秋天，又已在眼前悄悄地逝去了一半，那人們所歡欣歌舞的中秋節來臨了；然而，在這國家已至山河破碎，社會在鬧生活恐慌的今日，不禁又教育我觸景生情，望月含哀，來一度「傷心下淚」！</p>
<p>現在我看到月餅，又使我想起了我們的國家；因為我們現在的國家在一般列強的眼光中簡直就是一個月餅，他們可以隨便地來咬一口或分一塊，挖饀剝皮的，必欲吃光而後已。月亮，也許是年年一樣的光明，一樣地團圓的，而那些有興賞月的人也一定不會減少，可是我們國家領土呢？呵！國家，社會，自身，……我真不敢再去想它們了。</p>
<p>「八月十五月光明……」我還是唱一　「回　」來排洩這心頭的悶氣吧！</p>

<h3>月餅歌</h3>
<p>— （倪高風）</p>
<p>中秋節，月形圓，照耀人間分外鮮，月餅與月一樣圓。質既美，色又妍，家家戶戶購買各爭先，大世茫茫孽海間，浮沉事業等雲烟，樂得是令朝有酒今朝醉，管不了滄海桑田幾變遷。望只望安樂度眼前，願此團圓之月日日圓，鮮艷之花日日妍，更顧不得農夫汗滴下土劇可憐，慶賞秋光嘆沒錢，眼睜睜望着當空月嬋娟，月餅當前只垂涎，望梅止渴總徒然。聽得東鄰賞月東　邊，　這團敘聲喧闐，又聽得西鄰賞月西院前，把酒盈樽喜連天，榮枯何不同，相去不營若天淵。若說那都市裏的人們，吃月餅，慶團圓，尤比鄉人為誠虔，美酒佳　開綺筵，餅大如盆百果全，剖而食之笑開顔，或邀親友共餐，或敘家人才圓，狂呼太呌，喜地歡天，中秋令節，名不虛傳。更有一般卑職與屬員，假此時頭，化二百銀元，買一個大月餅送與煊煊赫赫天老官，不是黃緣，即是黃緣，苞苴賄賂都無關，諸希心照不宣，從此地位固而堅，維持一年又一年，處世的方針，竟是這般，我欲無言，真可憐，若不如此當周旋，難保地位沒變遷，月形圓，月餅形與明月一樣圓，原來是如此的因緣。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>中秋新語</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>客歲中秋，曾寫瑣話；　一轉瞬，佳節又臨。滿樹桂香，氤氳猶是，一天月色，皎潔如並；予則棄筆賣文，亦復依然故我。所微異者：前乃居鄉，今則寓滬耳。「萬里因循成久客，一年容易又秋風；」誦陸游詩，能毌感慨？「獨在異鄉為異客，每逢佳節倍思親；」吟王維句，益復低徊矣！</p>
<p>予於度節之事，嘗詆其為無謂，惟中秋一節，則獨愛之；此無他，予心愛月，中秋適值秋光之半，天高氣爽，雲淡風清，為賞月最宜之時，月亦實較他時為可愛耳！月姊有知，當以予為知已。</p>
<p>月姊之稱，人或以為據於嫦娥故事，其實非也；按，春秋感精符云：「人主，父天，母地，兄日，姊月，」其源蓋出於此。特以月姊二字，香艷無倫，故最為流傳人口耳。</p>
<p>慎子云：「月如銀丸，受日之光；」可知晚近因西來科學家言，吾國古已有之；予按；今之科學，與我舊籍合符節者尚多，此其一端而已。</p>
<p>古俗：中秋前一日，民以錦綵為眼明裏，遞相餉遺；是蓋由於鄧紹故事而起。續齊諧記，謂：「紹，八月旦，入華山，見一童子，執五綵　，承柏葉上露；紹問：用此何為？答曰：赤松先生，取以明目。」後人於以仿行成俗。亦有於朔日為之者，述征記云：「八月一日，作五明　，取百草頭露洗眼，令眼明也。」又以朱水，點兒頭額，名為天炙，以厭疾；亦在中秋前一日，俱見荊楚幾時記。</p>
<p>據酉陽雜俎載：「婆羅遮國，八月十五，行像及透索為戲；」奇民異俗，可為一噱。惟此婆羅庶國，究在何處，殊未能考；殆為烏託邦歟？又言：「長慶中，有人玩八月十五夜月，光屬於林，中如匹布，尋視之，見一金背蝦蟆：事亦奇誕。意者：或猶是齊東野語耳」</p>
<p>中秋月，有別稱，謂之「端正月。」故韓昌黎詩云：「三秋端正月，今夜出東溟。」予謂。其名固非不佳，第覺土封此字面，有嫌其太為端正一點之感耳。一笑！</p>
<p>詔明皇與申天師，道士鴻都客，中秋夜遊廣寒宮之傳說，頗為膾炙人口；所製霓羽衣舞曲，不傳於世，說者惜之。而不知古樂府，有孀娥怨曲，蓋漢人因中秋無月，而度此曲者；李賀八月樂詞，有：「孀妾怨長夜」句，即指此。　亦失傳，真憾事也。</p>
<p>「明月幾時有？把酒問青天。不知天上宮闕，今夕是何年？我欲乘風歸去，又恐瓊樓玉宇高處不勝寒。起舞弄清影，何似在人間。轉朱閣，低綺戶，照無眠。不應有恨，何事偏向別時圓？人有悲歡離合，月有陰晴圓缺，此事古難全。但願人長久，千里共嬋娟。」此詞壇爭誦之蘇東坡水調歌頭也。按：東坡朱嘉祐進士，至神宗時，與王安石議論不合，貶黃州，丙辰中秋，歡飲達旦，因填此闋，一時傳唱都下，內侍錄此進呈，神宗讀至又恐瓊樓玉宇高處不勝寒，曰：蘇軾終是愛君，乃命量移汝州。是亦不可不知中秋故實也。</p>
<p>中秋食品之最普遍者，厥惟月餅，而啖糕者蓋鮮，然往古則有之；元氏掖庭記云：「中秋之夜，武宗與諸嬪妃，啗月華之糕。」糕名月華，何其雅　！而况糕之為物，多為糯粉製成，製之得法，味當較諸月餅尤美；今後中秋，不妨重襲武宗故事，以倡食之也。</p>
<p>其餘應時食物，如：菱，藕，栗，柿，蘋菓，百合，石榴，芋艿，……之類胥是。又有一種藕餅，法以鮮藕搗爛，和以米粉，取桂花榨油為糕，製成餅狀，以油煎之。廿美腴潤，予所最嗜：惜乎今在客中，無從得食；言念及此，乃使我益增其　　之思已。</p>

<h3>又是中秋</h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>一年容易，又是中秋。</p>
<p>中秋在商業上是一個重要的節目，人事方面的調動，差不多都在這一天，他和年關比較起來，他的重要性實在差不了多少。在這個不景氣的惡浪無情地打擊着的年代，中國的民族工業又受着外來資本的重壓，我們實在不敢推想到這一重「節關」下將有多少工廠和商店悄悄地宣吿淸理，將會有多少人員因了緊縮而失業？而在今年，因了走私的猖獗，我們更不敢推想到卽使度過了中秋，依舊將會有怎樣的局面。</p>
<p>中秋又是個最易觸動遊子們愁緒的季節，古詩人的「月子彎彎照九　　幾家歡樂幾家愁」的詩句，早已替我們說盡了遊子的情懷了，這個傳誦一時家喻戶曉的詩句，還是古時人所作的，在現在，我們目睹着山河變色，（已經五年了！）並且國難還在一天加深一天的現在，我們的感想當然還不盡於此！</p>
<p>中秋的月亮是一年中最皎潔的月亮，我們望着他，實在不能無動乎中。我們還是躲在這瞅舞昇平的上海的一角的人民，雖然已經看到了敵人兇暴的面目，和由之而起的工商業凋敝的痛苦，但較之於在鐵蹄下生活着的，或者從鐵蹄下流亡出來的「亡鄕」人，多少總少一點「身歷」的痛苦，然而已經不勝「國破山河在」的滋味了；要是「漂零在外頭」的「亡鄕」者和遝陷在鐵蹄下掙扎着的人民，他們看到這皎潔的月色，想到長白山下，「天下第一關」中的「風景不殊」，他們又將會有怎樣的戚想呢？</p>
<p>上海在表面上是個歌舞昇平的世界，但要是揭破他奢麗的外衣，看一看裏面的實質，我們可實在沒有勇氣敢樂觀；這幾天，更因為海寗路不幸事件的突發，局勢顯得非常緊張，人心惶惶，大有不可終朝之勢，使得我們對這個紙醉金迷的上海，更不敢推想到它將會變成怎樣的一副面目？</p>

<h3>節</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>收賬的伙計像一頭卸了重載的老馬一樣，踏進店堂把黑漆皮的公事皮包在賬台上一放，倒在太師椅里祇是拿手帕拭着汗珠。見台上有一杯凉着的茶，搶來一咕嚕灌進喉嚨，才像讓出一張說話的嘴：</p>
<p>「一節不如一節了！八白多賬頭祇收到二百多塊！」</p>
<p>他打開公事皮包，把鈔票數過了送到經理先生面前，另外一症尊賬的發票</p>
<p>經理先生彷彿中了魔道。自從飯後伙計出門去收賬，他就打了好幾次算盤。藥店本來是最好出息的行業，用扛秤進貨，論分論錢賣出去；做放賬生意當然不能只只田鷄捉在簏里，普通打個八折九扣，四分對本也是穩穩到手的。年頭雖然不景氣，生病人還是有的，從端午到中秋，有八百多賬頭總稱得起好賣買。但是經理先生一上算盤，眼珠子停在算盤珠上幾乎回不過氣來，八百多賬頭打八折九扣全數收來，也祗够撈回自己的淸本錢，利息都打在廣吿，以及一切贈品等化費上了。</p>
<p>「這年頭見賣買難做！」經理先生不由地用着他的長指甲抓頭皮，在放賬台的小小地方徘徊起來。</p>
<p>對門一家糖菜店今天剛紮上彩牌樓，僱着幾個吹鼓手鬧了一早農，太陽光射着一街心，十二週紀念的電燈字巳經開放了，經理先生一抬頭來。他的眼睛就像被針刺着一樣難受。</p>
<p>「見鬼！」他的一股怨氣找着了發洩的地方，「一年四季大减價都算在里面，滿了十二週沒有？不要　　都是這些不　　　　　　　　　　　　　　店生意有什麼大减價，窮人就不該生病的，生得起病還怕不要命嗎？醫生，藥店，這是比棺材店還要硬的生意！不要臉，徧想出那些截屁股的大减價，登着一滿張的廣吿，紮電燈牌樓，贈送虎骨木瓜酒，於是你也减價，我也减價，延壽堂數百年的老店就一節上倒了下來……」</p>
<p>想着延壽堂倒下來，經理先生眼前就有無數的金蒼蠅在眼前飛舞。但是他免强定着心，又坐下來再打算盤，他自己下了許多譬如，譬如八百多賬頭能够收到六百塊錢，這中秋就可以免强過去了。年關是一年中最賺錢的一節，生病的要藥吃，不生病的也要吃補藥，王公館，李公館，參茸銀耳一兌就是三百五百，祇要拉住這幾家公館還怕倒下來嗎？</p>
<p>經理先生眼前才微微顯着一綫生機，他等着收賬伙計帶希望回來，一邊翻翻賬簿，抽抽烟袋，也不時投着卑視的目光向對街的彩牌樓示威。</p>
<p>收賬的伙計回來，店里已經吃過晚飯了，經理先生剛用着他的鵝毛管挑牙縫里留着的飯粒，他常常抱怨他的一口蛀牙，也常常唸着分到一筆花紅的時候，請牙科醫生滿口收拾一下，一個人吃總是要緊的。</p>
<p>現在伙計坐在他對而的太師椅里，眼前是二百多塊錢的鈔票，他全身通了電流一樣，慢慘地伸過手來去抓那一疊發票，第一張就是李公館的，這大主顧的尊賬是二百四十八元。</p>
<p>「什麼！」他對伙計證大了眼珠，「李公館也沒有收到嗎」</p>
<p>伙計點點頭，但是經理先生的眼晴沒有　開他的面部，才用最細小的聲音　了。</p>
<p>「他們一家都上靑島去了。那個常常和李太太一同來的老媽子吿訴我李老爺在交易所里虧上了二百多萬呢，說不定住宅也要變賣。」</p>
<p>經理先生坐了下來，他抖顫着手一張張的翻下去，眼前的金蒼蠅又成羣結隊在飛舞，漸漸地看不淸楚發票上的數目。但是那些數目在他肚里已生了根，——八百多塊呵！</p>
<h3>秋收後</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>老媽子提着把銅壼走進來。她一進門斜着臉對二老爺說：</p>
<p>「胡先生說振平回來啦，請二老爺瞅瞅糧食樣子去。」</p>
<p>二老爺哼了聲，把口角上的烟蒂丟到痰盂里，就走往院子里去。</p>
<p>院里的一畦胭脂紅都給秋風吹光了，黃綠色的葉子伴着淡紅的花片蓋滿了畦里的泥地，許多茉莉針結的黑色實子被風吹着在磚地上滾，二老爺走進帳房去，使手帕抹了下嘴角，桌子旁邊的兩個中年人都站起來。</p>
<p>二老爺坐在靠窗的上手椅子上，望着對面桌角處立着的振平說：</p>
<p>「你沒吃飯？」</p>
<p>「不忙，二老爺您瞅瞅這樣子。」　　這中年人使束家非常滿意，他自已在這鎭的南街上開着一家小雜貨舖，讓他兄弟看管着，他却替二老爺到各碼頭上收買糧食，放點有股實保人的借欵，他各樣都相當精明，還有點口才，這時他把桌上徘關的三個紙包子推過去，他指着頭一包：</p>
<p>「這大蛇眼（紅帽自粒的高粱）眞好，二爺您咬咬，冰榔口（卽乾脆）咱們收了一百五十担，那兒是老斗，合咱們這兒新斗（度量衡斗）三百四十掛個小零」</p>
<p>「什麼價？」</p>
<p>「這個五塊八，把第一包推到算盤旁邊，將第二包拉過來：「這個貨色差點，三塊二，這收的少，高粱一歸到底，煞到家大小價錢一均，連上脚力零化每担四塊一，現在咱們這的行情…？」</p>
<p>那個楞了半天，退到　桌邊坐着的賬房胡先生，正老老實實的聽着，他扣算買來的每担四塊出頭，集上來的糧米少，棉花可上的眞多，……猛的看見他那伙計正用眼睛問他，便性急的說：</p>
<p>「大價的四塊六—七。」</p>
<p>接着二爺的眼也扭過來看了看他，他靈利的將身子端端正正的坐起來。</p>
<p>這報吿了半天糧價的漢子走過來在　桌上的壼里倒了兩盃茶，很規矩揣到東家臉前一碗。</p>
<p>「二爺你不喝？」</p>
<p>二老爺看他連喝了幾碗茶，自己把桌上第三個紙包子打開，里面是胖胖的一大捧麥粒。</p>
<p>「這麥子什麼價？」</p>
<p>「麥子哪兒可太少，」大聲的呌喊着，好些吐沫星子嘖到桌上，東家白了他一眼，他把向空划搖着的手收回來：「方買了五十六担，本來說妥了七毛八，誰知道西街鴻昌家也上哪兒買去啦！他家出八毛二，讓他家搶買了七十大担去，我當下翻了臉，那有這樣作賣買的？我們都快「過斗」呵，他出大價收，斗局子里人說好說歹讓咱們包涵…。」</p>
<p>二爺有些不商興，他知道當地的麥子賣到九毛七八寒露都過了，一滴雨尙沒落，誰家也耘不上麥子，要能屯下三四百祖，明年春天就賺老了，怎麼讓人家化大價拱了七十担去！便說：</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>「你沒接着我那封信？」</p>
<p>「沒有！」</p>
<p>「唉，」很可惜的拍了下大腿下八毛二也要呵！」</p>
<p>那個漢子因為多說了陣話，很興奮，臉紅紅的，被東家這麼一說，知道當地麥子又漲了，覺得東家有點心思不痛快，便從腰里掏出收買糧麥的「花單八來，指點着告訴東家，那一家多少担糧，多少錢，最後他說：</p>
<p>「那兒斗局子的規矩：糧到付欵」！</p>
<p>二爺點了點頭，像痛愛一個孩子似的呌他到廚房里給他弄點什麼吃，這漢子就輕手輕腳的溜出屋去。</p>
<p>這時候院子里，提里郎匡的響起來，小求子跟老春正往東廂房里抬煤油，二爺隔着窗子看，看他們一桶一桶的快安排完了，便跟賬房先生說：</p>
<p>「你到步老三哪兒去說，這四十三塊錢的煤油錢，咱們收到房租賬上了，」</p>
<p>賬房先生嗯嗯了兩聲，就走到院里去，小求子正在那兒銷門，看見賬房先生出來，他一向身跳下台階，嚷着說：</p>
<p>「胡先生，寫步老三那兒四十五塊錢的煤油錢。」</p>
<p>胡先生冷不防這孩子尖溜溜的嚷了一聲，耳朶給震得盈盈地響了陣，他使一個指頭按着耳根說：</p>
<p>「東家說四十三。」</p>
<p>「又漲了，上邊運不下來明天一桶就賣五塊。」</p>
<p>胡先生扭轉頭看着玻璃窗子里震出腦袋的東家，那樣子好像說：到底怎麼辦？</p>
<p>二爺在屋里用手擺了擺，使着啞嗓子大聲。說：</p>
<p>「四十五就四十五吧，告訴他，呼們收在房租賬上啦！」</p>
<p>胡先生咳嗽着聳了聳肩，很快的就走出院子。</p>

<p>開篇「中秋難月」</p>
<p>年年月月度春秋。日月匆匆似水流。夫歲秋月猶在睚。今年八月又臨頭。想今日，十五月半中秋節。只見那，一輪明月照高樓。雲淡月圓頻添媚。恨不得，效學明皇月中　。月兒呀。我看　，今朝月容非往日。我看你，凄凉月色一概收。我看你，美滿月華頻欲笑。我看你，總因為家家慶月樂不休。我看你，雖然月清明如鏡。我看你，月光難解人　愁。你可曉，幾家歡樂同賞月。幾家凄凉對月憂。幾家見月傷心色。幾家愛月故出遊。幾家是，夫唱婦隨度蜜月。幾家是，日月東西各自謀。幾家是，月下歡聚共開筵。幾家是，歲月奔波到處投。幾家是，快活消遙邀滿月。幾家是，顛到日月不自由。幾家宛比中秋月。幾家好似殘月鈎。我想那，圓月到頭難免缺。就是那，殘月還恐雲來囚。世人怎比大空月。到後來，鏡中之月四虛浮。月缺還有重圓日。人死安能如月再回頭。月缺月圓年年在。人生怎及月長留。何能與月共千秋。</p>

<h3>周璇被男女學生包圍</h3>
<p>藝華新片「喜臨門」這幾天正在無錫患山拍攝外景，一齊去的有五六十人，每天六時起身，練習運動，七時，便忙着拉戲工作。無錫城鄉居民，好奇心動，大家趕來看熱鬧，圍而觀者常在千人以上，駐軍第三十六師恐生事端，派隊保護，形勢雄壯。還有許多男女學生，每天來找周璇，包圍着請她簽字，有時她覺得手也　了，</p>
<h3>大上海大戲院公映　五彩巨片「風月海盜」</h3>
<p>影業界第一部三原色立體五彩歌舞巨片「風月海盜」，今日起在大上海大戲院公映。該片係　星却爾柯林斯及「一痴情舞伴」主角史德斐杜娜二人合演，一代幽默大師佛　摩根助演。片中歌舞場面有五六場之多，而尤以西班牙響板舞及嘉拉貝舞為最精采。演員服飾，極其美麗動人。再加上色彩的渲染，更覺光輝奪目，鮮艷無匹。據聞雷電華攝製該片，曾耗資近三百萬金元云。</p>
<h3>「風流世家」今日公映</h3>
<p>背景越五大洲　畫面逾四百幅</p>
<p>華納影業公司，耗費兩年餘光陰，傾全力攝制的「風流世家」Anthon　Adverse一片，茲已提前於今日（星期三）起在大光明公映了。該部文藝片的攝成，已經震驚了好萊塢的整個影壇，都以為這是本年度電影界的一個最大的收獲。就電影藝術上的功績說，實較「仲夏夜之夢」等片為尤著。</p>
<p>片述少女瑪利亞，被一個勢利的父親迫嫁與年老神衰的唐魯意史侯爵後，和她的舊情人愛爾蘭少年軍官摩爾發生了肉體上的關係，珠胎暗結，乃相約私奔加拿大，不幸被唐發覺，一場劍　的結果，摩爾喪生於鋒芒之下。瑪產子後，也悽凉地死去了。唐把小孩送進修道院，這天恰巧是聖。安桑尼的瞻禮日，神父因名之為安桑尼。安至－歲時，被送到鮑納菲柴（即瑪父）家學業，鮑因特種暗記得悉伊為彼之外孫，盡情愛護，秘而不宜。這個情種，自小至大，先後熱變了三個女人，其間一個呌恩琪拉的也受了孕。後來她加入台魯勃歌劇團，聲譽日　，後來竟做了拿破崙寵愛的俘虜，直至安從菲洲歸來，想和恩重拾舊歡，忽然發現了他們的私生子。拿王知道底蘊，派安出使美國。全片就在安帶了第三代的小安桑尼，呼應出本片的題名，一帆隱約，漸漸駛遠的結束了。</p>
<p>當片子開拍的時候，劇本的改編，演員的選擇，就已經費了不少的時光和斟酌，並且因為故事中的區域，包括至五大洲，時間經過二十五年，均須仔細研究，不能虛構，而書中每一個人物的國籍，性情和年歲，臾須分析清楚，結果經過了二年，九十八個重要演員方才選定，四百幕背景方才建成。然後導演茂文李勞埃，才開始耗費了數月的心血，把這　有三百萬讀者的名說部「風流世家」，介紹到銀幕上去，這確是　　影壇的無上光榮吧。</p>

<h3>Chiang's Strict Order to Maintain Order and Prevent Evil-Doers from Inciting Incidents; Chairman Chiang to Return to Nanjing Within a Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang telegraphed orders to all provinces and cities regarding the protection of foreigners and the strict maintenance of local order, which the Executive Yuan has repeatedly ordered to be followed. Now that the foundation for national unification is gradually being laid, there are unscrupulous individuals intentionally engaging in sabotage. Multiple confidential reports have been received, stating that evildoers are secretly traveling to various provinces and cities, intending to incite incidents. If precautions are not taken adequately, accidents could easily occur, affecting the overall situation. Therefore, another telegram has been sent, urging the relevant military and police personnel to pay close attention and intensify their defenses, and to inform the public to understand the greater righteousness, vigorously maintain order, and not to treat this lightly. Chairman Chiang will return to Nanjing soon, and various circles in Nanjing are planning to hold a grand welcome meeting, which is about to begin preparations. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Hangzhou Municipal Government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to properly protect Japanese residents and has issued a public notice to promote friendly relations. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch) A Central News Agency reporter recently met with Central Committee member Chen Bulei and inquired about the date of Chairman Chiang's return to Nanjing. Chen replied that he would return to Nanjing within a week at the latest. This time, Chairman Chiang went north to return to Nanjing via Jiangxi Province. Because there are many important matters in Nanjing, even without diplomatic events, he would return to Nanjing for a while. However, there are still affairs in Jiangxi to be handled in recent days. As soon as the affairs are completed, he will return to Nanjing. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Report by Arita on the Chinese Situation at the Cabinet Meeting; Nagano Cancels Trip to Hokkaido</h3>

(29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops to Conduct Exercises in the Suburbs of Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Several hundred Japanese soldiers entered Beiping from Fengtai and Tongzhou tonight. Although prior notice was given to explain the purpose of their coming to Beiping, Chinese residents felt considerable apprehension about it. The Japanese troops participating in the large-scale exercises in the suburbs of Beiping tomorrow include seven tanks and six-wheeled trucks, which were all parked in the open space in the East Legation Quarter in the evening. The activities of the Japanese troops in the city of Beiping and the exercises in the suburbs tomorrow are enough to affect the joy of the residents of Beiping celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The autumn exercises of the Japanese troops stationed in various places in Beiping, Fengtai, and Tongxian have been extended to ten days starting from the 30th. More than 300 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tongxian, fully armed and carrying eight small steel cannons, arrived in Beiping on a special train this morning. After getting off the train, they formed a team and went to the Japanese barracks in the East Legation Quarter. At about 3:00 p.m., more than 500 Japanese armed soldiers stationed in Fengtai and Tongxian arrived in Beiping on seven trucks, 35 motorcycles, and five tanks, and assembled at the Dongdan drill ground. The Japanese troops who arrived in Beiping this morning also participated. Kawabe, Matsushiro, and Imai gave speeches respectively, and the Japanese Embassy notified more than 7,000 Japanese residents, men and women, in Beiping to go to Dongdan to welcome them. The ceremony ended at about 5:00 p.m. There were originally 1,000 Japanese soldiers stationed in Beiping, and now more than 800 more have arrived. The barracks could not accommodate them, so they were temporarily housed in the Japanese residences of Mitsui &amp; Co., Okura &amp; Co., and Xinchang &amp; Co. The dinner was hosted by the Japanese residents. The Japanese troops will assemble and be addressed at the Dongdan drill ground tomorrow before departing for exercises.

After the ten-day exercise is completed, the Japanese troops will leave Beiping. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Deputy Director Kong to Join Foreign Minister Zhang in Diplomatic Negotiations Is Inaccurate; Foreign Reports on Factions Among Chinese Government Personnel Have a Disruptive Effect</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A foreign newspaper in Shanghai reported yesterday that Chairman Jiang intended to send Deputy Director Kong as plenipotentiary representative to join Foreign Minister Zhang in Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. The reporter recently visited a secretary close to Kong and inquired about the truth. According to the secretary, diplomatic events have always been handled by the diplomatic authorities. Kong is also in charge of finance, and his official duties are numerous. How can he have the energy to take care of diplomacy? However, because Chairman Jiang is away from Nanjing, Kong is acting as the head of the Executive Yuan. It is natural for Foreign Minister Zhang to consult with Acting Director Kong on diplomatic events. If it is said that Kong represents him to jointly negotiate, it is unheard of. Moreover, Zhang has always been trusted by Chairman Jiang, and Kong also deeply admires him. They will resolutely abide by the central government's intentions to negotiate Sino-Japanese diplomacy, and there is no need to send another person to assist in the handling. The foreign newspaper's report is unknown what it is based on. Moreover, some foreign newspapers often divide Chinese government personnel into pro-Europe and America factions, pro-Japan factions, and other factions, which is even more absurd. Chinese government personnel, during their studies, may have differences in whether they studied in Japan, Europe, or the United States. Now that they are all serving the country, they all hold the same will to serve the country faithfully. What factions are there? The intention of such propaganda by some foreign newspapers is inevitably disruptive. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Clearing Up Smuggled Goods in Hebei; Joint Committee to be Formed to Handle; Jointly Organized by the Ministry of Finance, Hebei Political Council, and Customs; Results of Li Qingxuan's Trip North for Consultation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, regarding the issue of clearing up smuggled goods in Hebei Province, the Ministry of Finance, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and the Customs authorities are planning to establish a joint committee. This decision is the result of several consultations in Beiping and Tianjin between Li Qingxuan, counselor of the Ministry of Finance, and representatives of the Hebei Committee after Li Qingxuan came to Beiping. It is reported that Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun were also present at several meetings. Counselor Li has now reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

(29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin East and West General Stations have reported many cases of re-export of foreign goods in recent days, reaching more than 60 cases per day.

<h3>Establishment of the British, American, and French Monetary Agreement</h3>
<p>– Appropriate</p>
<p>In recent years, British and American economists such as Owen Young, Irving Fisher, Boishev, and Adair Sald have advocated the world currency stabilization movement. They believe that although international monetary conflicts are serious, everyone will naturally agree to a truce when they feel the pain. In any case, solving the monetary problem is always within human capabilities. The ideal of this movement can be said to have been initially realized with the establishment of the British, American, and French monetary agreement.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, the United States, and France have long held a common desire for international cooperation on monetary systems. The convening of the World Economic Conference in 1933 was based on this desire. However, the wave of economic nationalism that accompanied the economic panic at that time ultimately prevented the conference from avoiding collapse. Since then, the international currency has seen the struggle between the three major groups of the gold yuan, the gold pound, and the gold standard. This currency war has intensified step by step, causing great economic unrest in the world, which is harmful and useless to all three parties. Therefore, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have repeatedly paid attention to their common aspiration three years ago. The monetary war between the United Kingdom and the United States has eased since China reformed its currency system. This year, amid the unprecedentedly tense situation in Europe, France's serious financial and economic difficulties have made the United Kingdom and the United States deeply feel the need to provide assistance. Therefore, after three months of secret consultations, the British, American, and French monetary agreement was born.</p>
<p>The core of this agreement is the reduction of the par value of the French franc. Since the United Kingdom and the United States successively abandoned the gold standard, industrial production in France has stagnated, and the international balance of payments has deteriorated year by year. In recent years, a large amount of domestic gold has flowed out, forming a profound panic in the French financial and economic system. The only relief is the devaluation of the French franc. The reason why successive cabinets have supported the original value of the French franc against the tide is nothing more than because the disaster of the collapse of the French franc after the war is still vividly left in the minds of the people. Now, the People's Government has concluded a monetary agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States to fix the value of the French franc between 0.049 grams and 0.043 grams of gold. On the one hand, this prevents serious disturbances in international exchange rates. On the other hand, it allows the government to use the surplus of 130 billion francs after the revaluation of the value of gold reserves to adjust the domestic economic order. Worries about the adverse effects of the devaluation of the French franc have been largely eliminated. After the devaluation, not only can foreign trade be revived and financial difficulties be relieved in France itself, but also, in terms of the world economy, the foundation for stable currency parities has been laid, and the world's industrial and commercial prosperity can also be restored somewhat. Therefore, the French National Assembly passed this bill very smoothly yesterday.</p>
<p>However, in international politics, France's monetary reform and its related tripartite relationship have even greater significance. Politics and economics cannot be separated in any country. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France are all strong countries that advocate maintaining the stability and peace of the current world. They have always been in a leading position in the international economy. This time, the monetary truce and cooperation of the three countries can enhance their original leading position, and can also consolidate the forces of stability and peace in the current world. This should be a not-so-small blow to those ambitious countries that are demanding the re-division of the world. Our country has close monetary and economic ties with the United Kingdom and the United States, and is in its current situation. Then, thinking about the overall situation, is it not easy to understand whether the British, American, and French monetary agreement is beneficial to our country?</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Birthday; Central Propaganda Department Orders Grand Promotion; Nanjing Municipal Party Department Leads Preparations by All Circles; Lantern Festival and Lectures to be Held</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department believes that October 29 is Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. In order to make the people of the country deeply aware that Chairman Chiang is the only revolutionary leader of our party, and to express the enthusiasm of our party comrades in supporting the leader and commemorating Chairman Chiang's great revolutionary achievements, in addition to ordering the provincial and municipal party departments to lead local party members and representatives from all walks of life to hold celebration meetings to express the enthusiasm of the people and comrades across the country in supporting the leader, the capital should also be a model for the country and should be given special and grand publicity to express its admiration for the leader. The Beijing Municipal Party Department has been ordered to lead all circles in preparing for publicity. It is heard that the methods have been determined. The publicity in the provinces and cities will focus on indoor celebration meetings, flag-raising celebrations, and recreational activities. The celebration methods in Beijing will include lantern festivals and celebrity lectures. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Representative Urges League of Nations to Pay Attention to the Dangerous Situation in the Far East; Ambitions of Neighboring Countries Not Contained, Seeds of War Lurking; Serious Impact Will Affect Europe</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative to the League of Nations and ambassador to Paris, delivered a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly this morning, saying that China's political and economic revitalization has made significant progress in the past year. The central government and the southwest have dispelled their suspicions and made peace, and the political unification of the country has been announced. The authorities have taken major steps in improving public health, water conservancy, cooperative development, agriculture, industry, electrical transportation, and the technical aspects of road, rail, and air transportation. The doctor then cited the report of the China Committee of the League of Nations Executive Council as a clear sign of China's progress, and then asked to pay attention to the fact that China's currency and foreign exchange problems have been resolved with remarkable results. Due to the huge difference in the sharp rise and fall of silver prices, China has been troubled by foreign exchange for two years. The plan implemented by the Chinese government in November 1935 was unanimously praised by the country, and it has now produced a stable currency, stable exchange rates, and promoted exports, and the import surplus has been greatly reduced. The doctor once again asked the public to pay attention to the current political situation in the Far East, saying that a certain foreign country's active preparations for war, frequent movements of troops on the border, repeated border disputes, and armed aggression have been expanding day by day, which makes the overall situation potentially dangerous and may break out at any time, and will have serious repercussions affecting Europe. The doctor concluded by stating the recommendations recently announced by China to the League of Nations Secretariat regarding the reform of the League of Nations. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Strengthening the League of Nations Requires Military Backing</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Ambassador Wellington Koo, the representative of our country, delivered a speech at the League of Nations Assembly today, stating that there are two noteworthy aspects of the situation in the Far East: First, China has made significant progress in political and economic development recently. The technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China has also yielded substantial results. Since the implementation of China's new currency system, it has not only consolidated the currency and stabilized foreign exchange but also notably promoted exports and reduced import surpluses. Second, the intensification of military preparations by a certain country is on the verge of erupting, which will inevitably have a significant impact on Europe. Koo also described the situation in Europe, stating that countries are engaged in a race of military build-up, creating a precarious situation. Although there is a tendency towards economic recovery, the economic nationalism of various countries seeks self-sufficiency, increasing various obstacles to international trade. The general trend will continue to hinder the development of trade. Furthermore, the faith in treaties has suffered a major shock, and the psychological respect for international obligations has also been severely undermined. The collective peace system and security guarantees contained in the League of Nations Covenant have not been fully implemented, and even when implemented, they have not achieved the desired results. The problem lies in the slow and incomplete implementation, which often obscures the principles of law and justice for temporary convenience. History is full of precedents of sacrificing principles for temporary convenience, ultimately leading to increased international disputes. The situation in the Far East four years ago is about to be replayed in Europe today. China's faith in the League of Nations Covenant has not changed and firmly believes that the League of Nations is the only mechanism for handling international disputes to achieve peaceful purposes. The reason why the actions of the League of Nations are not fully effective lies not in the imperfection of the Covenant but in the inadequacy of its implementation policies and methods. Therefore, at the invitation of the Executive Yuan, China has drafted a plan to strengthen the important functions of the League of Nations. The various methods stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant should be regarded as including the methods or actions that the League of Nations is authorized to take under Articles 10 and 11, and should not be excluded. The Chinese government also believes that for the actions of the League of Nations to be effective, it is necessary to make them swift. And during emergencies, swift action requires sufficient preparation in advance. As for the member states using military force to back the League of Nations, the Chinese government firmly believes that the sanctions methods stipulated in Article 16 should also have military force in reserve to produce rapid results. Koo concluded by stating that China hopes to reconvene the disarmament conference and convene an international economic conference to study the economic problems of various countries. China will strive to optimistically contribute to world peace based on collective security. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Russian Representative's Speech Advocates for Collective Security, Refutes Hitler's Anti-Russian Remarks, Three Non-Permanent Council Members Elected</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly convened this afternoon and immediately elected three non-permanent members of the Executive Council. The elected countries were Bolivia, New Zealand, and Sweden. Bolivia succeeds Argentina, New Zealand succeeds Australia, and Sweden succeeds Denmark. After the election, the General Assembly continued the general political debate. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov delivered a speech, exploring the issue of revising the League of Nations Covenant in detail, stating, "Today, some powerful countries have shown obvious signs of aggression, while most countries have not yet realized this aggression.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Nanjing's agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups are celebrating the birthday of Chairman Chiang. The second preparatory meeting will be held tomorrow. The principles of celebration are: 1. To build a memorial tower in the city center to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday. 2. To publish publications to honor his achievements. 3. To hold a celebration ceremony at the Lixingshe. The entire business community of the city will hang flags and light lanterns to celebrate. The location of the memorial tower is suitable in Xinjiekou, but various circles have already designated the site for the statue of Sun Yat-sen, so it will be necessary to conduct a re-examination or select a suitable location on Zhongzheng Road, or in Xuanwu Lake. The expenses will be automatically shared by all circles, or assigned by rank. (Special dispatch on the 29th) The danger is truly regrettable. However, some countries also recognize the necessity of common defense and sincerely believe in upholding the collective security system. If such countries only stop at issuing verbal official statements, while the aggressive countries base their policies on material advantages, it is appropriate that they will be defeated. France's proposal to convene a disarmament conference is sincerely supported by the Soviet Union. However, some countries believe that the League of Nations must become universal to include major countries. If the organization of the League of Nations is not universal, there is no need to do anything. The Soviet Union cannot agree with this view. Since Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly stipulates that each member state should respect and protect the territorial integrity and political independence of other members, it is natural that those who aim to conquer the territory of other countries, the countries they rule, will not be willing to cooperate with the League of Nations. Now, to revise the League of Nations Covenant to satisfy these countries, it would be better to say that it is to seek the universality of the League of Nations than to say that it is to abolish the basic principles of the League of Nations." Litvinov then advocated that the issue of implementing the principles of the League of Nations Covenant should be submitted to the First Committee (i.e., the Legal and Regulatory Committee) for discussion.</p>
<p>After Litvinov's speech, Danish representative Munch followed with a speech, also opposing the revision of the Covenant but advocating the establishment of a special committee to find ways to improve the mediation procedures for international disputes. The General Assembly adjourned at 6:30 p.m. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, at the League of Nations General Assembly today, vehemently refuted the recent remarks made by German leader Hitler at the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress, which strongly criticized the Soviet Union, in very sharp terms. The gist of his remarks was that the leader of a country who has listed the expansion of foreign territories that he wants to seize cannot sincerely accept the provisions of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the maintenance of the territorial integrity and current political independence of each member state). Moreover, a country that promotes a regional war as legitimate cannot be reconciled with Article 16 of the Covenant (i.e., the provisions on sanctions). Aggressors who base their policies on seizing power through brutal force can only be subdued by combining the relative strength of various countries. The united power of all peace-loving countries in the world must exceed any alliance of aggressors. In today's world, to avoid world war and force aggressors to join the common system of collective security, the joint action of the aforementioned peace-loving countries is indispensable. Litvinov also said, "We do not object to attempts to conclude agreements with the most aggressive countries in the world, but if they manipulate the content of the agreements or offer benefits to induce them to join the negotiations, we cannot agree to that."

<h3>Canada Abides by Covenant Principles, Supports Separation from the Treaty of Versailles, Decision to Participate in War Depends on Circumstances</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King stated today at the League of Nations General Assembly regarding Canada's attitude towards participating in possible wars that any decision by Canada to participate in war must be determined by the Canadian Parliament based on all existing circumstances. King then discussed the League of Nations Covenant, detailing the historical position of the Canadian government on this issue, stating that this does not mean that the Canadian people are in no way prepared to participate in actions to resist aggressors, but the natural obligation to use force cannot be made a practical political argument. Canada reaffirms its adherence to the basic principles of the Covenant, but believes that formal amendments to the Covenant are now impossible or unnecessary. Canada supports the separation of the Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles. However, if the League of Nations is to fulfill its duties, it must restore trust and goodwill between European countries. Therefore, the first step of consultation should embrace the goal of attracting countries that have not joined the League of Nations to ultimately succeed in achieving universal membership.

<h3>Japan Filled With Wartime Atmosphere, Telegraph Bureau Abnormally Tense</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the Shanghai Incident, due to the intense attitude of the Army and Navy authorities, the whole country has been filled with a wartime atmosphere. In addition to military aspects, telecommunications and transportation have also shown a degree of tension unseen in four years. According to investigations, the Osaka Central Telegraph Bureau normally sends and receives an average of about 90 telegraphs to and from China daily. Recently, due to the urgency of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the sending and receiving have been very tense. On the 21st, 111 telegraphs were received, and on the 22nd and 23rd, about 100 telegraphs were received. Between 94 and 97 telegraphs were also sent, and they were all military telegraphs. This shows a glimpse of the internal tension of the Japanese authorities. (China United Press dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>United States Eliminates Narcotics Smuggling, Sends Secret Agents to Various Places</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Ministry of Finance today dispatched more than 2,500 secret agents to various parts of the country to eliminate narcotics and liquor smuggling. It was discovered that a recent narcotics smuggling case involved a Chinese woman, Wen Mary, who was arrested last month in Los Angeles for attempting to smuggle drugs worth US$50,000. The Ministry of Finance then decided to launch this elimination campaign. Since the repeal of Prohibition, the authorities have been more passive about liquor smuggling, but the federal government has suffered huge tax revenue losses. This is also related to the current decision to eliminate smuggling. (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Strengthens Far East Military, Army, Navy, and Air Force Lineups Solemn</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to reliable sources, the Soviet military authorities, believing that Japan is actively expanding its military in Manchuria and that the Soviet Far East territories are greatly threatened, have recently dispatched an additional 10 infantry divisions, 3 science corps, 900 aircraft, and 700 heavy tanks to concentrate in Khabarovsk. At the same time, the Pacific Fleet was dispatched to concentrate in Vladivostok, equipped with 800 aircraft, 200 tanks, 60 submarines, and 15 cruisers to prevent invasion.

<h3>France Orders Ban on Gold Exports, Chamber of Deputies Passes Coinage Bill, All-Night Discussion, Noise for Half an Hour, Wage Progressive Clause Deleted, Government Authorized to Prohibit Price Increases</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government today ordered that all exports, transshipments, and transactions of cash or gold coins, except those introduced by the Bank of France, are temporarily prohibited. This order will be implemented immediately to prevent any cash from escaping the current situation before the new currency bill is established. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The National Bank of France today stipulated that the sale of cash must be at least 5 billion francs per unit. Previously, the minimum unit for the sale of cash was 215,000 francs. (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies held an all-night meeting, which was suspended for half an hour due to noise, and finally passed the bills on the devaluation of the franc and the nationalization of gold today. The bill, which contains 25 articles, was passed with 350 votes against 221. During the debate, Finance Minister Wally Wahre sincerely stated the importance of the international monetary agreement, calling it a turning point in the history of international relations and a symbol of the end of monetary instability. He continued that France can benefit greatly from the agreement. After years of desolation, the sudden emergence of the new currency law is the beginning of a new era. Many members of the Socialist Party and the Left Party then stood up and cheered in approval. The decision was debated fiercely. At 11 p.m. last night, a certain member of the Radical Socialist Party said that some people would enrich themselves by harming the country, causing an uproar and suspending the meeting for half an hour. A certain member of the Right Party spoke in a sarcastic tone, saying that the Blum franc was not made of gold but of rubber. At the same time, negotiations were carried out behind the scenes, and Prime Minister Blum agreed to cancel the provision in the bill that gradually increased wages and replace it with a clause authorizing the government to prevent price increases. After the Left Party accepted this amendment in principle, the Chamber of Deputies passed the amendment with 335 votes against 199. The Senate convened at 11:45 a.m. this morning and accepted the bill, but then adjourned the meeting until tomorrow, so the bill cannot become law before tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Situation of Discussions in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>(Paris) The House of Representatives continued its session after noon, discussing the currency bill. The first speaker was the Radical Socialist Party Representative and former Minister of Finance, Painleve. Painleve stated that attention should be paid to the repercussions that currency devaluation could have on the middle class, and that social order should be maintained at all costs, as this was the only way to encourage French capital that had fled abroad to return to France. Painleve criticized the method of indexing wages to prices, saying that this method would cause prices to continue to rise, and the result would be that currency reform would fail.</p>
<p>Following Painleve, former Minister of Finance Renault gave a speech. Renault has the highest authority on financial issues, so his words attracted much attention. He expressed his strong support for the principle of currency devaluation, but said, "Unfortunately, this move is too late. The Bank of France has already lost 300 billion francs in gold reserves. Currency devaluation has become a global phenomenon. Today, it is extremely difficult to find a country that has not devalued its currency. It is only natural for France to devalue its currency now, but we cannot but blame the government for its previous declarations that it did not want to devalue its currency. However, after the promulgation of the new currency bill, the atmosphere of unrest that has prevailed in the country for the past four months will be completely transformed. However, it is not enough for the government to take this one step. At the same time, it must also economize on government spending and balance the budget in order to succeed. Our country's currency is now on par with the two major industrial and commercial nations of Britain and the United States, which is indeed a good plan. However, in the future, we must find ways to make Britain, the United States, and France live in the same economic climate. Therefore, funds flowing out of the country must be recovered, and a large number of unemployed people must be resettled. All of this cannot be done by the currency devaluation policies of either the left or the right. Moreover, currency devaluation, if done well, will benefit the country and the people. However, if it is not done well, it will inevitably lead to continued devaluation, and the consequences will be unimaginable. The government should now frankly declare to the working class that it acknowledges the failure of past experiments, just as the policy of monetary tightening has failed. If this is the case, the working class will surely understand and trust the government. After all, there is no country in the world that is economically bankrupt and where the working class can be happy. Based on past experience, countries around the world that have adopted currency devaluation policies have generally achieved success. Will France be the only country in the future to fail because of adopting a currency devaluation policy? We dare to ask the government officials this question."</p>
<p>After Renault finished speaking, Minister of Finance Olivol rose to reply. Olivol first stated that after Italy, Britain, and the United States successively devalued their currencies, world prices had fallen to below the level before the Great War. Therefore, production and consumption were not in harmony, which was a major cause of the economic panic. As a result, French finances were extremely difficult. At the beginning of this year, the former cabinet's Minister of Finance, Regnier, had to borrow from London. Moreover, the economic panic was not unique to France, but was suffered by countries all over the world. Therefore, since 1933, countries had repeatedly tried to establish international economic agreements. People all over the world had been eagerly awaiting this kind of international cooperation. After several years, it had finally been achieved recently. As far as the current financial situation in France is concerned, the government's deposits in the Bank of France still amount to a huge sum of 80 billion francs, which shows that the devaluation of the currency is not due to financial difficulties. Olivol continued to emphasize the importance of the joint declaration issued by Britain, the United States, and France on currency agreements, saying, "The French government can now guarantee that after the devaluation of the franc, the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar will not be affected, and other countries will not impose tariff retaliation policies on France because of the devaluation of the franc. From this, it can be seen that the cooperation between Britain, France, and the United States can be said to be fully achieved. Moreover, the extent of this devaluation of the franc is determined according to the leveling of world prices, so domestic prices will definitely not be affected by it and rise. This is different from the policy of inflation, which can affect domestic prices. France suffered deeply from the scourge of inflation after the Great War, and it was not until 1926 that the late Prime Minister Poincaré devalued the currency and stabilized the exchange rate. However, at that time, he suppressed speculation, reorganized finance, and worked hard, and it was not until after 1928 that he achieved success. Now, the government should also follow the methods at that time, handle things in a practical manner, and definitely not allow speculators to profit from it."</p>
<p>After Olivol finished his speech, the House of Representatives adjourned the meeting and reconvened in the evening. During the adjournment period, the various left-wing parties in the House of Representatives held a meeting and decided to delete the section on indexing wages to prices from the currency bill. The Property Party and the General Confederation of Labor both agreed to delete that section and replace it with another section, which stipulated that "The National Assembly authorizes the government to maintain the purchasing power of the franc within the country, or to prohibit improper price increases, or to use other methods, as determined by the government." After this section was deleted and revised, the currency bill will be passed in the National Assembly more smoothly.</p>
<p>At 9:35 p.m., the House of Representatives continued its session. At first, only a few unimportant members of parliament spoke, criticizing the government's bill. In addition to what Painleve and Renault had said during the day, there was nothing new. Then, right-wing Representative Roland spoke, saying that the guarantees that the government had obtained from Britain and the United States were insufficient, and that the currencies of Britain and the United States were not stable, so they were not reliable. Left-wing Republican Representative Delie was concerned about the repercussions of the currency bill on farmers. At this point, Radical Socialist Representative Redol got up angrily and said, "If so, then let the true masters of France, the 200 wealthy families, pay!" (Note: The 200 wealthy families refer to the 200 major shareholders of the Bank of France.) At this point, the entire venue was in an uproar, and the speaker had no choice but to declare a short recess.</p>
<p>At 11:10 p.m., the House of Representatives continued its session. Communist Representative Duglot spoke, saying, "The Communist Party has not benefited from the devaluation of the franc, but the Communist Party will not oppose it." As of the time of writing, the debate in the House of Representatives had not yet ended. It is estimated that the currency bill will be put to a vote late at night or early in the morning. It is expected that the result of the vote will be passed by a large majority. The number of votes in favor will be about the same as the number of votes that the government has received in the House of Representatives several times since June of this year.

<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Leon Blum personally mounted the rostrum and delivered a long speech, defending this article and explaining the reasons for the government's current currency and general policies. He said, "Regarding the currency issue, I (the Prime Minister referring to himself) and Minister of Finance Olivol have been under pressure from several parties. What these people are asking is that we should devalue the currency immediately after taking office. The main reason is that the national treasury is currently encountering the most serious difficulties. Once devaluation is implemented, a huge sum of 250 billion francs can be obtained immediately. Minister of Finance and I did not accept this opinion at first, and we continued to work hard to engage in the great cause of economic recovery. Now, although we have no choice but to adopt a new currency policy, I am not ashamed of it. It should be known that US President Roosevelt also found a satisfactory method after experiencing exploration regarding the revival of the country's economy. Moreover, I do not admit that what I have done in the past is wrong."</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate Between the Pound Sterling and the US Dollar Has Not Been Determined</h3>
<p>(London) Rumors that Britain and the United States are about to reach an agreement to strictly regulate the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar have now been denied by the authorities. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced today that Britain and the United States will jointly use the balance funds of the two countries to maintain the balance of world currency, according to the tripartite agreement concluded due to the devaluation of the franc. However, the two countries have not specifically agreed on a fixed ratio between the US dollar and the pound sterling. (Gan National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Central European Countries Will All Devalue Their Currencies, the Italian Cabinet Convened an Emergency Meeting, Austria and Turkey Join the Pound Sterling Group, and the Dutch New Currency System Plan Was Drafted</h3>
<p>(Vienna) It is rumored that the currencies of Central European countries will all be devalued by 10%. Negotiations have begun between the governments of the respective countries to study the new situation of international currencies after the devaluation of the franc. A Czech representative arrived here yesterday to meet with Austrian financial figures. It is estimated that if the Central European countries can reach a currency agreement, then Austria will implement devaluation. However, Austrian officials still say that the status of the Austrian currency is not threatened. (Havas Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning. It is estimated that there will be an important decision regarding the future of the Italian lira. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini held an important secret talk with Minister of Finance Taongtaileville today. The content should be related to the devaluation of the currencies of France and other gold standard countries. People generally predict that Italy will not take any monetary measures until the French currency bill is passed in the National Assembly. The Italian lira is a kind of domestic currency, and its foreign exchange is strictly controlled by the government, so there is no need to change the current situation. However, the Italian business community is paying close attention to the new currency policies decided by Switzerland and the Netherlands, and obviously supports the devaluation of the lira.

<p>(Vienna) According to a government gazette announcement, the exchange rate of the Austrian currency will be based on the pound sterling from now on. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(The Hague) The Dutch government announced today that it has banned the export of cash. It is heard that the Council of State completed drafting the government's new currency bill this morning. The method it adopted is generally the same as the pound sterling. The bill will be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion tomorrow. It is expected that it can be passed by a very large majority. After the currency reform, an exchange equalization fund will be established to maintain the foreign exchange rate of the guilder. In addition, Prime Minister Colin gave a radio broadcast speech tonight, advising the people to remain calm, and saying that the government has always advocated stabilizing the value of the guilder and opposed currency devaluation. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Istanbul, Turkey) The Turkish government recently issued an order to cancel the French franc as the basis for the Turkish currency "piastre," and changed the basis to the pound sterling, and stipulated that the purchase price of the pound sterling is 6.35 piastres per pound, and the selling price of the pound sterling is 6.38 piastres per pound. In the future, all transactions on the exchange should be calculated according to this exchange rate. (Havas Telegram, 28th) Prime Minister Leon Blum then said that after the social laws passed by the National Assembly were implemented, France's economic situation had greatly improved. At that time, Spain suddenly broke out in civil strife, and Germany announced the extension of military service, and Europe suddenly appeared unstable. The French government had no choice but to increase military spending to consolidate national defense. Or, because we recently initiated negotiations with Britain and the United States to negotiate a currency agreement, and some people blamed the government for not often doing this, I ask, is this not the duty of the government? Thanks to this agreement, domestic gold will not continue to flow out, people's purchasing power can be increased, and social welfare can also be guaranteed. The peace undertaking that we are eagerly awaiting is an important factor in this agreement. Some people are completely ignorant of the importance of the agreement. I really don't understand why. Havas News Agency recently gave me a declaration from US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for review. He said that the content of the British, French, and American currency agreement contains the meaning of the three countries' exchange equalization funds working together to seek the universal stability of the currency system. Morgenthau's words are worthy of honor, and are also sufficient to be the stepping stone for mutual trust.</p>
<p>Leon Blum then said that he will no longer tolerate strikes in factories. He hopes that workers and factory owners will understand the government's intentions, so that the government can carry out its tasks without hindrance.</p>
<p>Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives Duglot (Communist Representative) then rose to speak, saying briefly that the previous right-wing cabinets failed to properly address various financial and social problems, so the currency devaluation method had to be implemented. The Communist Party originally opposed the devaluation policy, but now it will vote in favor of it, because if the Leon Blum cabinet falls due to the currency bill being rejected, then the right wing will surely take the stage, which is not what the Communist Party wants, etc. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>My Country Will Benefit, Export Trade Can Be Improved</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) British Ministry of Finance expert Rogers and Guangdong Provincial Finance Director Song Zi-liang arrived here from Guangzhou today and said that the devaluation of the franc will benefit China. This is contrary to the opinion of most people. He also said that the change in the value of the franc will increase the prices of goods in the United States and the pound sterling group countries, so China's export trade and currency status should improve. Rogers continued that there are many opportunities for investment in China, but due to political reasons, it is very difficult to contact loans. Rogers will take a boat back to Shanghai on October 2nd to take up the post of financial advisor to the National Government. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebels 40 Miles From Capital, Government Denies Moving Capital, Rebels Prepare to Strike</h3>
<p>(Lisbon) According to a radio message issued by the Burgos rebels indirectly received here, the army has begun to advance from Toledo towards Madrid. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Gibraltar) Spanish rebel General Tranno broadcast a message from the Seville radio station today, saying that the revolutionary army is now only 41 miles from Madrid. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Lisbon) After occupying Toledo, rebel commander General Franco is currently assembling his troops, preparing to quickly attack Madrid. According to today's guest, "We cannot waste time at the moment. Madrid's resistance is not worth laughing at. Once we set out, we can go straight to the city. We will be invincible and indestructible." According to military authorities, the current plans for both sides to attack and defend the capital are roughly as follows. It is expected that the government army will take Navalgarmino and Irilegas on the Madrid-Talavera road as the main defense, in order to cover the traffic on the important railway from Madrid to Valencia. The rebels plan to concentrate at a certain location near Woliaster Le, 40 miles from Madrid, and prepare to attack the government army within a few days. One critic believes that the rebels' attack on the area is unstoppable, because the soldiers in the army have been fighting for a long time and are equipped with the latest weapons, and the commanding officers are also well-trained. According to one correspondent who accompanied the rebel rescue column to be the first to enter the town, although Toledo had undergone street fighting, the whole city was still intact, except for the north side of the Alcázar Castle, which was slightly damaged. One officer and 20 soldiers were the first to enter the city, followed by a detachment of 30 people. After an exchange of fire, the reinforcements penetrated deep into the center of the city. While the government artillery continued to bombard the castle, the planes of both sides soared in the sky, appearing quite active. The remaining warriors who had been trapped in the Alcázar Castle in Toledo for a long time, at a glance of their comrades, shouted Long Live Spain, raised their rifles high, broke out of the siege, and joined the reinforcements, and this historically famous war came to an end. According to official announcement, as a result of the battle, out of the 1,200 people in the Alcázar Castle, 80 were killed, 500 were injured, and the rest were rescued. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>(Lisbon) Lisbon Daily's special correspondent in Toledo said that the leaders of the National Army believe that after the fall of Toledo, the fall of Madrid is only a matter of time. It is believed that the first fierce contact will be near the capital. Most of the province of Toledo is a plain and is not suitable for defense. The vanguard of the National Army will not easily take the mountainous road before the capture of the Getafe airfield near the capital. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(La Vera) The government army and the rebel army fought fiercely all day today to compete for the entire province of Toledo.

<p>(Madrid) The Ministry of the Interior denied the rumor of moving the capital by broadcasting on the radio today, saying that this was a misunderstanding caused by several members of the cabinet inspecting various places nearby and asking the people to rise up to resist the rebels.

<h3>British and Australian Air Race, All Planes Took Off Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>(London) The British to Johannesburg air race, worth 10,000 pounds in gold, was scheduled to depart from Portsmouth Airfield today. At 6:30 a.m., crowds gathered in the field, many of whom had stayed up all night waiting, singing for fun. Due to the large number of people, the planes could hardly move and depart. The crowd then moved back at the request of the pilots and the staff of the field. As a result, the planes were able to take off one every minute. The first one to depart was Findlay's plane, at 6:30 a.m., and the last one to depart was Smith's, at 6:38 a.m. A total of nine planes are participating in this year's race. It is expected that the weather will be cold and unfavorable in the initial stage of the journey.

After the planes arrive in Cairo, they will adjust their time. It is expected that the winner can arrive in Johannesburg tomorrow. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Internal Organization of the Income Tax Affairs Office, Divided into Five Groups with Assigned Responsibilities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance announced that the second category of income tax on the salaries and remuneration of civil servants and the third category of income tax on the interest income of public bonds and savings deposits will be levied on October 1st. It is currently reorganizing the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office into an Income Tax Affairs Office, in order to coordinate the collection of income tax. Gao Bingfang and Liang Jingchun will continue to serve as the director and deputy director of the office. The internal organization is planned to be divided into five groups, and the responsibilities of each group have been assigned. The first group is responsible for the income of profit-making enterprises, the second group is responsible for the income of salaries and wages, the third group is responsible for the income of securities deposits, the fourth group is responsible for accounting, and the fifth group is responsible for affairs. The candidates for the group leader are tentatively Ning Encheng, Zhang Hua, Qu Zhaorong, Sun Chaoxuan, and Sun Xiaocun. Other office staff are all transferred from the original Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office and the Central Party Headquarters that handled income donations. The procedures for collecting the two categories of income that will be levied on October 1st are relatively simple, as they are all withheld by various agencies, so they are handled directly by the Income Tax Affairs Office. There is no need to set up collection agencies in various provinces and cities for the time being. Only the Ministry of Finance will first send personnel to contact and guide the withholding in various ways. All income taxes withheld by various agencies from October 1st onwards should be submitted to the local Central Bank or the China Communications Bank and the Postal Remittance Bureau entrusted by the Central Bank for transfer to the national treasury. As for banks and money houses, they will only withhold income tax on interest income on savings deposits that have reached settlement from October 1st onwards. Those that need to be settled at the end of the year should be withheld at the time of settlement declaration. In addition, the income donation collected by the central government will be stopped on the 30th. (Central News Agency Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>American Sailor Arrested and Sentenced in Berlin: Imprisoned for Three Years for Promoting Communism; United States Awaits Official Report</h3>
<p>(Berlin) More than a year ago, an American sailor, Simpson, was arrested in Hamburg on charges of treason and espionage. Today, he has been sentenced to three years in prison by the "People's Court." He has been detained for four months before the verdict, which can be reduced accordingly. At the hearing today, the Nazi prosecutor did not file espionage charges, but only said that Simpson had communist activities in Germany. The evidence was that Simpson had carried communist slogans and pamphlets when he arrived in Hamburg. Simpson said, "I don't know what harm these printed materials have, because the Communist Party can hold open meetings in the United States and can elect its own presidential candidates." At that time, a former member of the German Communist Youth Movement named Rez testified that Simpson had repeatedly delivered communist texts and letters from the American Communist Party to the Hamburg branch of the German Communist Party. Simpson denied this. The court today also appointed a lawyer to defend Simpson, arguing that Simpson did not spread communist texts in Germany, but because the United States has always taken a laissez-faire attitude, the Communist Party is naturally easier to operate in the United States than in Germany. The prosecutor requested a sentence of four years in prison, and the defendant's lawyer argued for a maximum of one year. As a result, a three-year sentence was handed down. (28th Guomin Report)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. State Department told the Associated Press today that it is awaiting the official report from U.S. Consul Kissel in Berlin regarding the trial of the American sailor Simpson, who was sentenced to three years in prison in Germany today on charges of espionage and treason, before it can decide what steps to take. The authorities declined to make a formal statement on the outcome of the trial, but said that Germany attaches great importance to communist activities, and Simpson admitted in court that he had communist activities, so the three-year prison sentence is still considered lenient.

<h3>Japanese Authorities Decide to Ban "Humanity" for Disrupting Morality; Religious Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>Osaka: Omiki Tokuichi, the religious leader of the "Humanity" religious group in Osaka, was recently accused of violating chastity. On the afternoon of the 28th, the Osaka Police Department, acting on the orders of the Ministry of Interior, launched a major operation. More than ten police officers were sent by car to the headquarters of the "Humanity" religious group and the residences of the religious leader and other 37 staff members to search for evidence. The religious leader Omiki was taken to the basement of the Osaka Prefectural Office, where he was interrogated by Police Inspectors Honda and Yamaguchi. (28th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Osaka: The interrogation of Omiki, the religious leader of the "Humanity" religious group, continues fiercely. As a result, his immoral acts are being exposed one after another, most of which are sexual crimes. On the morning of the 29th, the interrogation was conducted focusing on the life of the religious leader Omiki. According to Omiki's confession and a large number of seized evidence, not only the issue of violating chastity, but also the structure of his doctrine and the state of his activities must be scientifically reviewed. The prosecution believes that if the religion disrupts morality and is not allowed by society, it will completely block it in the same way as the Oomoto religion. (29th Allied News Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Build Airfield by Force in Baotou; County Magistrate's Attempt to Stop Them is Ineffective</h3>
<p>Baotou Dispatch: For a year, Japanese aircraft have been quite frequent in their coming and going to Baotou. Recently, they are again planning to fly regularly to transport passengers and goods, and also plan to build an airfield in Baotou. The site has already been surveyed in Bancun, two and a half miles outside the South Gate. The local authorities were not aware of this beforehand. When the Japanese were surveying the site by car a few days ago, they accidentally knocked down a telegraph pole. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate and only then learned that an airfield was going to be built. The bureau questioned them at the time and expressed opposition, but the Japanese said that the land was ownerless. Currently, the Japanese have entrusted the Fuchang Company in the Tianjin French Concession to hire more than 30 Chinese workers to come to Baotou a few days ago, and have also hired four Japanese workers. According to the Chinese workers, when the company recruited in Tianjin, it stated that they were going to work in Zhangjiakou, but did not state that they were working for the Japanese. After arriving in Zhangjiakou, they said they were going to work in Suiyuan. After arriving in Suiyuan, they said they were going to work in Baotou. When they set off from Tianjin, each Chinese worker received an advance of five yuan from the employer for family expenses, and the daily wage was set at 80 cents. The Chinese workers also said that had they known they were building an airfield for the Japanese, they would never have been hired. The airfield started construction on the 24th of this month. Zhao Zhongrong, the county magistrate of Baotou, negotiated with Hamada, the Japanese official stationed in Baotou, to stop it. According to Hamada, he had already obtained the consent of Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Suiyuan. Zhao then asked Chairman Fu for instructions. Fu not only expressed that he did not know about it, but also ordered Zhao to find a way to stop it. On the morning of the day before, Zhao sent Song Mingqing, the director of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Du Xiapu, the director of the Third Branch, and several police officers to negotiate at the airfield. At this time, Hamada and the four Japanese workers had left the airfield and entered the city. The thirty-odd Chinese workers, who understood the greater good, saw that Song and others had come to negotiate, and immediately stated that they were willing to sacrifice their labor and follow Song and others into the city, and were unwilling to work for the Japanese, and asked for a way to send them back to their hometowns. Song and others immediately took them all to the Public Security Bureau and reported to County Magistrate Zhao, so that he could negotiate with Hamada to stop it. However, Hamada had already heard about it, and sent personnel to the Public Security Bureau in the afternoon to negotiate for the handover of the Chinese workers. County Magistrate Zhao handed over all the Chinese workers, and they were still led away by the Japanese. At about 8:00 PM, when it was already late, a Japanese aircraft flew from Suiyuan to Baotou, circled the city once, and landed at the Eurasia Airfield outside the city, presumably to negotiate. However, according to County Magistrate Zhao, he is determined to find a way to stop it.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government to Start Digging New Canal Within This Year; Survey Already Completed, Funds Being Planned; Establishing Reclamation Area Management Committee to Improve Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang Dispatch) The Jiangsu Provincial Standing Committee's problem of developing the Northern Jiangsu Salt Reclamation Area, previously invited people from Shanghai's banking and industrial circles to visit, and also implemented the surveying of the new canal line in the reclamation area. The surveying work has now been completed. After this, the work in the reclamation area will become more specific. Currently, Jiangsu Province is planning to raise funds for the opening of the new canal and for the improvement of the cotton industry. The latest information obtained is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>New Canal Line Survey Completed</p>
<p>In order to prosper Northern Jiangsu, develop the reclamation area, revitalize commerce, and relieve the rural areas, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to open a new canal line to the east of the Grand Canal, starting from Nantong and going north to Chenjiagang Port in Guanyun. It also organized a survey team, appointing Xu Nanxou as the team leader, and led technicians to survey the new canal line. After leaving to implement the survey in March of this year, after half a year of effort, the survey has now been completed. Currently, the team is working on design and drawing charts, etc., which can be completed in about one or two months. The problem of opening up can be realized within this year. The cost is about 10 million yuan, which is currently being planned by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Establishment of Reclamation Area Management Committee</p>
<p>In order to develop the reclamation area, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to start with improving the cotton industry and opening up cotton fields. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Production Improvement Office was established in Nantong to handle cotton breeding and other work. On the other hand, it is actively planning to complete the new canal project in order to promote the development of farmland. However, the reclamation area is vast, and it is difficult to achieve development and promotion without concentrating manpower and financial resources. It is now planned to establish a Coastal Reclamation Area Management Committee in the reclamation area, directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. In terms of organization, there will be one chairman and one vice-chairman (there is a saying that the candidate for chairman is concurrently held by Director Shen Jian). Under the committee, there will be one secretary and three departments: General Affairs, Reclamation, and Economics, with specialized personnel appointed. This plan is being reviewed by the provincial authorities. It is said that if the Reclamation Design Committee is realized in the future, it will be merged into the Reclamation Department in order to concentrate efforts and coordinate management.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Improve Cotton Industry</p>
<p>The cultivated cotton fields in the province's cotton reclamation area have reached more than 13 million mu, and there are more than 6 million mu that have not yet been cultivated. In order to actively develop the cotton industry, the provincial government previously invited the banking industry to inspect and requested as much investment as possible. Currently, this issue is still under negotiation. According to Cao Jikuan, deputy director of the Agricultural Management Committee, the provincial government, in view of the urgent need to develop the cotton industry, has decided to allocate 100,000 yuan first for this year's cotton industry improvement. The detailed distribution method has been ordered to be drafted by the Improvement Office. The improvement methods will start with investigation and production registration. As the cotton crop matures, it has been harvested everywhere. This year's harvest is still good. The Agricultural Management Committee will soon hold registration matters to engage in the first step of improvement.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Industry Improvement Policy</p>
<p>The various points regarding the opening of the reclamation area and the improvement of the cotton industry are as described above. The policy for improving the cotton industry is as follows: (1) Improve cotton seeds and improve the cotton industry in order to improve quality and increase production. Therefore, for Chinese cotton, attention should be paid to improving the lint quality, increasing the ginning percentage, and purifying the species. For American cotton, attention should be paid to maintaining its original improved characteristics, accelerating the maturation period, and increasing its salt resistance and boll resistance to rain. (2) Pest prevention and control. There are many types of cotton insects, and their harmful conditions vary with seasons, regions, varieties, and cultivation methods. Efforts should be made to prevent and control them in order to reduce cotton farmers' losses. (3) Improve saline land. The area of saline reclamation in northern Jiangsu is very large, but because the salt content is too high, it is not suitable for crop growth, and it has become wasteland. It is planned to study improvement so that cotton crops can grow appropriately to increase soil production. (4) Eliminate accumulated habits. Chinese cotton farmers have the bad habit of adding water and adulterating cotton, and cotton merchants have the malpractice of suppressing and manipulating cotton prices, so that the quality of cotton cannot be improved. Honest cotton farmers also follow suit because the high-quality cotton they produce cannot get a fair price. These accumulated habits must be eliminated in order to improve.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau's Recent Progress: Hangzhou Installs Long-Distance Amplifiers; Selectively Installs Terminal Amplifiers; Province Opens Up Communication with Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province's telephone business has always been known for its development, especially the long-distance telephone item. After the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau's intention to operate, the completeness of the telecommunications network is the crown of all provinces in the country. Previously, the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau, with the province's long-distance telephones spread throughout the cities and towns, and has been in contact with Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Fujian provinces, communication locations are increasing day by day, and the mileage of the line is also increasing day by day. In order to improve the clarity of long-distance calls, it has actively planned to install telephone amplifiers in various important bureaus to increase the volume of long-distance transmission. It is now known that the amplifier in the Hangzhou No. 1 Bureau is a cord circuit 23 type amplifier, which can be 20 times more effective, has been installed first, and the farthest Yongjia and other places in the province have been tested with Nanjing, Shanghai and other places. The result of the transmission is quite clear, and it will be enabled immediately. At the same time, the bureau selectively installs terminal amplifiers next to long-distance telephones in important bureaus and the bureau's retail outlets in the Hangzhou National Products Exhibition Hall, etc., so that the volume transmitted from long distances can be amplified 12 to 20 times. It is also known that the bureau has decided to open up telephone communication with Nanjing, Shanghai and other places in Jiangsu Province from October 1. All telephones from Beijing, Shanghai and other places to the southeast of the province are required to be temporarily connected through the Hangzhou amplifier. In the future, the volume of calls will definitely be clear.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Farmers in Hutang Township Robbed</h3>
<p>Su Bingsheng's family, a farmer in Hutang Township, Fifth Bao, Eighth Jia, Eighth District, Punan, was attacked by more than ten bandits at about 11:00 PM on the 24th. They all spoke in a local dialect and carried rifles, wooden sticks, and other weapons. They broke the kitchen window and entered to rob. Later, they went to the adjacent third household, Su Yinxing's family, and rummaged through boxes and chests in each room. When the owner, Su Yinxing, resisted slightly, he was hit on the head. After two hours, they fled with the stolen goods. The owners dared not report the incident for fear of the bandits taking revenge. Later, it was learned by the Ninth Sub-Garrison, which sent police to investigate. Only then did they learn that the stolen clothes and silver dollars were worth nearly 100 yuan. The bureau has been notified to order its subordinates to assist in the arrest.</p>
<h3>Commissioner's Office Relocates to New Office</h3>
<p>The office of the Third District Commissioner's Office and Security Command, the newly built People's Education Center in the Confucius Temple, is too small and insufficient for office work. After reporting to the provincial government for approval, it will all move into the old Viceroy's Yamen for office work tomorrow (30th).</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Early Rice Rent Paid in Advance</h3>
<p>The terrain of this county is low-lying, especially in the northwest. Recently, due to frequent floods and insect plagues, rice is often transplanted early. The early rice has now been harvested, and the late rice is about to be harvested. However, according to the long-standing custom, rent is not collected until after the Frost's Descent Festival. The tenant farmers have already consumed all the blood and sweat they have earned in gambling. When the landlords propose to collect, they are often unable to pay. The educational bureau and other agencies, and more than 20 landlords including Wu Meinong, jointly presented a petition to County Magistrate Peng, requesting that he find a way to improve the situation and collect rent earlier. It is now learned that it has been stipulated that tenant farmers who plant early rice will start to pay rent ten days after the Autumn Equinox.</p>
<h3>Strange Visitor Suddenly Appears at Central School</h3>

After Principal Xu dissuaded him to no avail, he immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau. When Inspector Wang Yaomin was dispatched to stop him, the man had already gone far away. He was later encountered in front of Ma'anshan. When he was taken to the bureau for questioning, he claimed to be surnamed Dong and was from Liaoning.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Timetable Change for Xihu Bus</h3>

The main ones are to delay the first bus in the morning to 7:00 AM and advance the last bus in the afternoon to 5:05 PM. The bus to Shanghai will be moved even earlier to 3:35 PM.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Autumn Harvest Colors in Various Townships</h3>
<p>This year's early rice in various townships has been a bumper harvest. However, with the exception of the southwest and northwest townships, which can be harvested by more than 90%, the eastern townships such as Chefang, Xietang, Tianjing, and Guoxiang are slightly inferior in harvest due to the impact of wind and insect damage. In the Tianjing and Xuanzhu townships in the Weiting area, the harvest is only about half due to wind, insects, and other factors. According to recent observations, the average autumn harvest in this county is about 70-80%, and at most 90%.</p>

Inside and outside the city, mountain goods stores, southern loan shops, and tea and snack shops, incense and candle shops, etc., are unusually developed. Other industries such as silk shops and department stores are also due to the arrival of the new autumn season. People generally need to replace their autumn clothing items, and after Qiulan Dengchang, the rural economy can be active. Farmers in the countryside come to the city to add clothing and various supplies, so business has been quite good for several days. Although the profit and loss of various industrial and commercial industries has not yet reached the time of the major closing, and the details are unknown, the general situation is very stable. Factories such as yarn, silk, flour, and oil cloth have had good business for half a year and are expected to make a profit. The silver and money industry is cautious in lending. It will not be difficult to get through the Mid-Autumn Festival safely. Other industries such as rice, beans, miscellaneous grains, silk cloth, southern goods, mountain goods, and department stores also have the hope of making a profit.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Exhibition Group Comes to Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Central Air Defense Exhibition Group was originally scheduled to come to Wuxi on September 2 to hold an air defense exhibition. Later, because the exhibition was held in Zhenjiang first, it was decided to postpone it by one month. On one side, the county government is engaged in preparations, and a ground shelter is built next to the Thousand Sun Tree next to Duoshou Building in the park, and air defense items are arranged and displayed separately in the western reed shed for exhibition. All kinds of exhibits are models of both passive and active aspects. It is now scheduled to be open to the public from October 10. All kinds of exhibits will be escorted to Wuxi today by Yang Rongzhang, a member of the Air Defense Department of the Military Commission's Air Defense Office and a guide to the Air Defense Exhibition. The personnel of the exhibition group who come to Wuxi include Wu Lisheng, Chairman of Air Defense, and Liu Zhen, Leader of the Air Defense Group. The county government has joined forces with the person in charge of the tour exhibition group to invite local groups to hold a meeting on schedule to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Inspector Ding Visits Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Ding Chaowu, Jiangsu Inspector, came to Yangzhou by special train at about 6:00 PM on the 27th. He immediately drove into the city to inspect the county government. After being accompanied by County Magistrate Ma Zhenbang to inspect the various departments for a week, he immediately transferred to Lun to Tai.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Malignant Malaria Epidemic</h3>
<p>Malignant malaria has recently been discovered in the rural areas of Nantong and Rugao counties, and the epidemic is very severe, with successive deaths. The Fourth District Commissioner's Office has sent Yan Xifeng, director of the Health Experimental Area, and doctors to provide relief. The Rugao county magistrate has also telegraphed the provincial government to request funds for relief.</p>
<h3>Young Woman's Hidden Treasure Stolen</h3>
<p>Yu Ling, a young woman from Tongyi Shigang, returned to her mother's home in Lu Ning. The 8-noon yuan hidden in the cellar of her bedroom were stolen that night, 4,000 yuan in banknotes and 2,800 yuan in silver. She sued her aunt, Yu Zhang, and the servant Ding Dao, to the court on suspicion. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution against Yu Zhang and others. The criminal court held a public trial and acquitted all defendants due to insufficient evidence. The prosecutor has now appealed.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Tide-Watching Train Starts Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Highway First District Management Office, because the autumn tide this year is particularly large, and has not been seen in more than ten years, has actively prepared to open a special tide-watching train. It has now mobilized about 40 large buses for application. The special tide-watching train from Hangzhou to Haining will start for four days from tomorrow. Tickets have been sold in advance. In terms of security, the Provincial Security Command and the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau have each sent a large team of troops to take charge of defense along the way, which is extremely thorough. The office has also sent patrol police, relief vehicles, and fire trucks to depart in case of emergency. The Baobao Tide Watching Platform and parking lot have been completely arranged. The Shanghai Economic Travel Agency's tide-watching group of more than 200 people is scheduled to come to Haining from Shanghai on the 30th to watch the tide. The Yousheng Travel Agency's group of more than 100 people is scheduled to arrive in Hangzhou on October 3, and has telegraphed in advance to take care of everything.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Villagers Find Gold While Renovating House</h3>
<p>Ah Liang, a resident of Zhujia Du, Cixi, is 30 years old and a farmer. His ancestors were quite wealthy, but gradually declined. When Ah Liang took over the family affairs, it was extremely difficult. Fortunately, Ah Liang was diligent and thrifty. Over the years, he gradually saved some money. Seeing that the house was dilapidated, he hired workers to renovate it the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, he found a right cellar under the back wall, with a wine vat inside, which was extremely heavy. When he opened it, there were white and yellow objects. Ah Liang was overjoyed. In addition to rewarding the workers, it is said that there are more than 2,000 yuan left.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Disputes Arise from Buying Wheat</h3>
<p>This year's bumper harvest in northern Anhui has not been seen in many years. Flour mills from north and south have sent people to gather in Bengbu to set up shops to buy wheat. Since the noon season, the wheat market has been quite active. Grain shops act as agents to purchase on behalf of customers, charging a commission of 8 cents per stone. Grain shops with activity compete to be bought by flour mills to make profits. Under the circumstances of soliciting and attracting customers, unexpected disputes have occurred. Recently, the person in charge of the Bengbu wheat shop of Yicheng Flour Mill in Zhenjiang suddenly announced that after the wheat purchased by the factory in Bengbu this year was transported to the factory, it was found that there were abuses such as mixing in dampness, mixing in hair, and short weighing, and wrote to the grain industry agencies, requesting the elimination of bad elements among the grain-selling boat households and staff members. The members of the Grain Industry Association and the Salt and Grain Staff Vocational Union here were in an uproar when they saw this, believing that the shop deliberately damaged its reputation, and expressed their indignation, sending letters to the Yicheng General Factory one after another, and planned to negotiate with the shop to resolve it according to law.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Aiming for Financial Gains in the Great Barrier Reef</h3>
<p>— Written by Nettie Palmer of Australia, translated by Bu Ren</p>
<p>Recently, the Australian government has felt severely uneasy because Japanese ships often appear in the waters of northern Australia, and Japanese people often land on the coasts of the Australian continent, which no one has ever cared about. Lighthouse keepers reported such repeated intrusions by the Japanese, and holiday travelers camping in quiet harbors also witnessed large numbers of Japanese landing to search for food.</p>
<p>Of course, it is natural for those who regularly catch abalone and sea cucumber to see this group of Japanese who have come from across the sea as formidable rivals for their business; they demand that the government find ways to stop them.</p>
<p>The Japanese also come to collect abalone. Their arrival is bound to cause a rather difficult international dispute. The crux of the problem lies in the Great Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef is a mixture of islands, sand beaches, and coral reefs, surrounding the coast of Queensland, one of the states of the Commonwealth of Australia, about 1,200 miles long, forming a breakwater on the Pacific coast. The distance between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland coast varies, some reaching twenty miles, some reaching fifty miles. Enclosed within this is a calm sea, which is usually considered Australian territorial waters.</p>
<p>However, this traditional ownership has become a problem due to the intrusion of the Japanese. Because the Japanese have long envied the abundance and value of marine products in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef, they have now begun to invade.</p>
<p>For example, abalone shells are produced here. Every year, 1.5 million pounds of abalone shells are exported from the Great Barrier Reef, most of which are shipped to Japan. This is a coarse and easily polished shell. Because the Japanese obtain this cheap raw material, and because Japanese families usually have their own shell grinding machines, the Japanese have defeated Europeans and Americans, who use expensive pearl shells as raw materials for mother-of-pearl, in the mother-of-pearl button market.</p>
<p>The most important purpose of the Japanese invasion of the Great Barrier Reef is to plunder the raw material for making buttons – the abalone shell. Their usual method of intrusion is to moor the mother ship on the outer shore of the Great Barrier Reef and steer small boats into the inner sea through narrow streams.</p>
<p>My husband and I have been camping on a small island in the Great Barrier Reef for almost a year, so I understand very well the difficulties of managing these waters and the attitude of the local boatmen towards intruders from across the sea. The small island where we live is one of the ring-shaped coral islands along the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>This small island is purely composed of coral, about forty acres in area, but there are also lush jungles on the island. The island is surrounded by a shallow swamp, surrounded by irregularly shaped reefs, with rugged reef surfaces exposed at low tide, on which we sometimes walk for several miles. This is an ideal lookout point, where we can leisurely observe the structure of the Great Barrier Reef and become familiar with the aquatic life of the Great Barrier Reef residents.</p>
<p>For newcomers, the Great Barrier Reef is indeed a miracle. At first, we imagined that the Great Barrier Reef was just a continuous coral wall leaning against the coast like a fortress. After on-the-spot observation, we realized that it was a complex fortress composed of many coral bodies with different degrees of development, with coral reefs exposed at high tide, coral reefs completely above the water surface, old reefs covered with sand and grass, and beach reefs that are the same as usual and grow beautiful trees. We saw all of this in just a short day's voyage.</p>
<p>The people we saw were mostly fishermen from the mainland and boatmen living on the island. In the last fifty years, the navigation industry in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef has made considerable progress. The headquarters of this business is located on Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, where a large number of shallow-water fishing boats are manufactured and sold. These fishing boats are mostly owned by Australians, operated by natives, and the captains are mostly Japanese.</p>
<p>Every year in March, at the end of the rainy cyclone season, these fishing boats depart from the south, gradually moving north, carried by the trade winds. When they reach a suitable location, they anchor for about a week, sending small boats to collect marine products such as abalone, sea cucumber, and pearl shells. Their actions are supervised by the Australian government: the coral reef itself is not allowed to be damaged in the slightest, and the capture of shells less than two and a half inches in diameter is also prohibited. This supervision is quite easy because the marine products collected by these fishing boats must pass through Thursday Island, where they are loaded and exported.</p>
<p>In addition to industrial value, the Great Barrier Reef is a place where indigenous people – whether living on the mainland or on the island – make a living. Diving and collecting seems to be a natural talent for them, just like primitive people living by hunting.</p>
<p>I still remember the first time I saw a group of boatmen coming to our island. Their small boat happened to be parked outside the reef.</p>
<p>"Who owns your boat!" I asked, my eyes fixed on the small boat.</p>
<p>One of them proudly shook his head.</p>
<p>"Our boat is not owned by anyone else, it is owned by ourselves."</p>
<p>Later I learned that on their island – Badu Island – the Queensland government has implemented a cooperative system in recent years, that is: the government provides loans to the natives, asking them to prepare their own boats, and the marine products collected are purchased by the government. This system seems to be quite effective, because the living standards of those natives have improved a lot compared to the past.</p>
<p>The boatmen of the Great Barrier Reef are really a lovely group of people! They are mostly of mixed race. They come from the islands in the Torres Strait (which was originally a place of contact between different ethnic groups), and from their appearance we can guess that their ancestors were Malays, Polynesians, Melanesians, and aborigines of the Australian continent. Regardless of their origin, they generally love the Great Barrier Reef and are proud to be residents of the Great Barrier Reef. From their singing, we understand their proud feelings. When they go ashore for recreation, it is not difficult to ask them to sing in our tent.</p>
<p>They usually sing simple and repetitive lyrical songs, some of which are composed by themselves, and some of which imitate tunes from other places. These lyrics mostly describe their own life at sea and the storms and other dangers they encounter. They also often hold banquets, singing and dancing together, forming a majestic and funny group performance.</p>
<p>Gradually, the Great Barrier Reef waters, a paradise, has begun to be noticed by people other than those who make a living locally. Every sunny winter, travelers from the cold south often come here to travel; in the palm groves, houses have been built to accommodate tourists.</p>
<p>Not many years ago, a British natural science research expedition led by Dr. C.M. Yonge came to Low Woody Island, about forty miles north of our small island; they came to investigate the nature of marine plankton (food for whales) and study coral problems.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, another scientific research expedition will come again. There are originally many questions about coral growth, and the islands of the Great Barrier Reef are nothing less than a natural laboratory for studying these questions.</p>
<p>However, in addition to being related to scientific issues, the Great Barrier Reef is also a main body of political issues that are bound to cause disputes. Should the waters between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland be considered Australian territory? Is the intrusion of the Japanese a kind of theft? In the near future, these questions will be presented to the world.</p>

<h3>Income Tax to be Implemented Tomorrow, Banking and Money Industries Prepared to Implement, Money Industry Notifies Members to Convene a General Meeting, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Prints and Distributes Regulations and Detailed Rules</h3>
<p>After the income tax on interest from securities deposits is approved and implemented tomorrow, the Banking Association prepares all procedures, the Money Industry Association notifies the convening of a meeting, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce prints and distributes income tax regulations and detailed rules. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Banking Preparations</p>
<p>After the temporary member representative meeting of the Banking Association decided to comply with the order of the Ministry of Finance and implement the income tax, it decided to wait for the Central Direct Tax Preparation Office to issue the various income tax forms and instructions before notifying the member banks to comply. As for the opinions proposed by the Banking Association, which are divided into two categories: explanation and revision, they have been submitted to the member banks for research. After the opinions obtained from the research are returned to the meeting, they will be compiled and contributed to the Ministry of Finance for adoption.</p>
<p>Money Industry Meeting</p>
<p>Since the Money Industry Association decided to organize an income tax research committee, the candidates for the committee members (six people have been nominated by the Autumn Managers Meeting and the Executive Committee Meeting, and the remaining three will be nominated by the members general meeting on October 2. The notice has been issued to convene a members general meeting. The notice states: Respectfully, October 2 is the date of the 12th members representative general meeting of the third session of this association. I hope that your representative will come to this association at 2 pm on that day to attend and discuss, and jointly plan the progress. I pray for your happiness. Shanghai Money Industry Association Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Prints and Distributes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has determined that the income tax on salaries and interest will be levied from October 1. It has printed many copies of the regulations and implementation rules for the business community to consult. The association specially notified all associations in the city yesterday that if they need any, they can contact the association's affairs section at any time. Each copy will be charged a cost of 3 cents.</p>
<p>Liang Goes to Beijing</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Banking Association believes that the regulations and implementation rules for the securities and deposit interest income tax organized by the Ministry of Finance do not have specific provisions. Therefore, the Banking Association has studied and formulated various points. After discussion at the temporary members general meeting the day before, it was decided to submit them to the member banks for research, and another meeting will be convened in the near future to discuss them. As of last night, no opinions have been submitted to the association. Today happens to be the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all banks are closed. Therefore, this matter will not be able to be discussed until the first day of next month at the earliest. It is also planned to send representatives to the Ministry of Finance to make representations. However, the association has informed the member banks to comply with the Ministry of Finances order to start operations on the first day, and in fact, it will not be possible to forward it to branches in various places for unified handling until the method is determined and various forms are issued. The income tax that should be deducted before the start of operations will be deducted by each bank, but the banks will not be responsible for those that have already been paid out. It is also learned that the Central Direct Tax Office will be established in Beijing on the first day, and responsible persons will be assigned to each province and city. The Shanghai Office will be headed by Deputy Director Liang Jingchun. After Liang went to Beijing the night before to ask for instructions, he immediately took the forms and tax collection instructions to Shanghai.</p>

Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and according to the regulations of the Chamber of Commerce, a day off is given. Currently, because the display work of the display department has not yet been completed, and the unfinished affairs of the commercial field department on Jingan Temple Road also need to be rushed, the association has specially notified all the staff of the affiliated display hall to work as usual, and to work overtime tonight and tomorrow night to rush everything.

The National Exhibition received a letter from the Municipal National Sports Federation yesterday, sending five female visitors to serve as opening receptionists. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Anti-Smoking Campaign Enters a New Stage, Great Results Achieved in the Chinese Area, Concessions Still Awaiting Continued Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the registration of smokers in Shanghai has ended, and Ma Liang, the commissioner sent by the central government to Shanghai to handle registration and reporting, is about to leave Shanghai and return to Beijing to report on his mission. Therefore, the anti-smoking affairs in Shanghai will now enter a new stage. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Commissioner Ma to inquire about the past registration of smokers and future anti-smoking measures. The information learned is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Past Smoker Registration</p>
<p>Commissioner Ma first stated the past smoker registration situation, briefly saying that during the past reporting period, those who had already registered and obtained licenses before the period and whose licenses had expired and went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to renew their licenses totaled more than 19,000 people. During the reporting period, more than 24,000 people applied for supplementary registration. More than 11,000 people had already quit smoking, and more than 1,000 people had left the city or died. This is the situation obtained after several months of investigation.</p>
<p>Reporting Work for Three Months</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Commissioner's Office in early May, after nearly a month of preparation work and a month of closing work, the actual reporting work was only three months. Fortunately, the local authorities and leaders provided timely assistance, so great results have been achieved in the Chinese area. Even in the concessions, considerable results have been obtained. Now that the closure of the office has been completed, Ma will leave Shanghai within days to visit General Supervisor Jiang in Beijing to report on the registration of smokers in Shanghai. Ma expressed his gratitude to the local leaders in Shanghai for their enthusiastic assistance in handling the anti-smoking policy, and also expressed his gratitude to the news media for promoting the government's purpose of anti-smoking at any time.</p>
<p>Concession Anti-Smoking Issues</p>
<p>Commissioner Ma reiterated the past negotiations on anti-smoking in the concessions in Shanghai, briefly saying that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, so it is difficult to handle anti-smoking affairs. In the Chinese area, the anti-smoking policy is carried out in accordance with central laws and regulations, but because it is difficult to promote in the concessions, the anti-smoking policy in Shanghai is greatly affected. Therefore, I am very concerned about this matter. The city had drafted opinions and submitted them to the headquarters, requesting negotiations with the consular corps. The headquarters immediately consulted the Executive Yuan and handed it over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that diplomatic procedures were time-consuming and requested the local government to directly negotiate with the consular corps. Therefore, the headquarters ordered me to reply, and I had repeatedly consulted with Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. Secretary-General Yu had begun to exchange opinions with the concession authorities, and local leaders in Shanghai, such as Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Yu Qiaqing, had also made suggestions to the concession authorities. Initially, the concession authorities did not fully understand China's anti-smoking policy. After repeated statements from all parties about the determination of the Chinese government to ban smoking, and explaining the steps to carry out anti-smoking, they have now been able to fully understand it. However, due to procedural issues, future consultations should be continued to determine specific measures that can be taken in the same way as in the Chinese area to promote the anti-smoking campaign. Then, the anti-smoking affairs in Shanghai will be able to achieve even greater results in the future.</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 People Quit Smoking</p>
<p>Commissioner Ma finally talked about the future anti-smoking policy, saying that there are a large number of smokers in Shanghai. More than 10,000 people have already quit smoking, and the anti-smoking hospitals in Shanghai are still continuing to actively handle the anti-smoking work. In the current situation, about 1,000 people can quit smoking every month. However, if smokers who have already quit smoking are not properly handled, there is a risk of relapse. Therefore, I believe that efforts should be made to establish smoker factories or other production organizations. One is to enable the smokers who have quit smoking to be managed and supervised in an orderly manner, and the other is to enable them to engage in production. Moreover, if the concessions in Shanghai can proceed in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations, the anti-smoking policy will be less complicated. Furthermore, all negotiations are still ongoing, so the headquarters will send personnel to the provinces and cities to permanently preside over the anti-smoking policy. Awaiting the headquarters research, I will report the situation in Shanghai after going to Beijing, and will attend the National Anti-Smoking Conference. At this conference, the future anti-smoking affairs will be discussed, and General Supervisor Chen will decide.</p>
<h3>Three Banks Transport Cash to Guangdong to Replenish Fractional Currency Reserves, National Monetary Unification Can Be Completed From Now On, Impact of Three-Country Currency Agreement on Exchange Rate Reduced</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, there have been rumors that the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are transporting cash to Guangdong. The reporter specially visited the Central Bank to meet with the responsible officials to inquire about the truth. It is said that the monetary system of Guangdong Province has been reorganized by the central government. The total amount of fractional currency previously issued in the province was more than 249 million yuan. The shortage of the 60% cash reserve was more than 17%. The Ministry of Finance is now borrowing the full amount from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and will continue to transport it to Guangdong to replenish it. After this, the fractional currency reserves of Guangdong Province have been replenished in accordance with the law. The provinces financial economy must trend toward improvement, and the promotion of legal tender must increase. The three banks are aware of this and plan to continue to transport cash to increase the issuance reserves. During the conversation, the reporter asked about the currency agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The responsible official replied that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have entered into a currency agreement to strengthen the monetary systems of the European and American powers, to make prices tend to a consistent balance, and to promote economic cooperation. From now on, the ratio between the British and American gold and the French franc will be stable. Chinas legal tender is closely related to foreign exchange, and the exchange rate between the United Kingdom and the United States is particularly important. Now that the currencies of the three countries have been agreed upon, the exchange rate of legal tender should be more stable, and the impact of exchange rate changes will be reduced.</p>

<h3>Chinese Economic Society Annual Meeting - Yesterday's Society Affairs Meeting - Mayor Wu Hosted a Luncheon Reception for the Society Affairs Meeting - Cultural Groups Hosted an Evening Banquet - Today's Group Excursion - Re-election of Five Foundation Custodian Committee Members, All Re-elected</h3>
<p>The 13th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society was held yesterday, the third day. In the morning, members' papers continued to be read. At noon, a banquet was hosted by Mayor Wu. In the afternoon, a society affairs meeting was held to re-elect directors and members of the Foundation Custodian Committee. In the evening, various cultural groups held a public banquet for all members at the YMCA. Today, members will be divided into two groups to visit scenic spots in Suzhou, Changshu, and other places. Tomorrow, they will visit cultural and industrial and commercial organizations, followed by a tea party in the evening to thank various sectors and to close the meeting. Details were previously reported as follows:</p>
<p>Reading of Papers</p>
<p>Starting at 8:30 AM yesterday, papers continued to be officially read in the East Hall on the 9th floor of the YMCA. Society President Li Zhaohuan presided. Due to time constraints, the authors of the papers read a summary of the general idea and key points, followed by criticism and supplements from other members. The papers officially read yesterday morning included Wang Yutong's "China's Economic Problems in Extraordinary Times," Chen Changheng's "Several Major Economic Problems and a Review of Financial Problems During the National Crisis," Ma Yinchu's "Price Issues and Paper Currency Policy in Non-Extraordinary Times," Wu Depei's "Transportation Economic Policy in Extraordinary Times," and Zhu Qichuan's "Discussion on the Paths to be Taken by Rural Finance in China During Extraordinary Times," totaling five papers. The session ended at around 11:00 AM, and attendees then traveled by car to the city center to attend a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu and to visit various constructions in the city center.</p>
<p>Public Banquet by Cultural Groups</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, Shanghai Universities Joint Association, Academia Sinica, Shanghai Chinese Christian YMCA, Shen Bao, Xin Wen Bao, Science Society of China, World Chinese Students' Federation, and other cultural groups in the city hosted a public banquet for the society's members at the YMCA cafeteria at 7:00 PM yesterday. Over one hundred guests and hosts attended, including Wang Yunwu, He DeKui, Pan Xulun, Cao Yunxiang, Zhu Boqi, Zhu Xinong, Wang Zulin, Wu Yugan, Ding XieLin, Ma Chonggan, Ma Yinliang, Lu Ganchen, Lu Gaoyi, Li Zhaohuan, Ma Yinchu, Liang Qingchun, and others. Cao Yunxiang presided, and Wang Yunwu delivered a welcome speech, stating that, "Everyone, I am both a host and a member, so what I want to say relates to both aspects. The society has reached its 13th annual meeting since its establishment. We now have over 700 members, with over 300 permanent members, bringing together talent from the political, business, and academic fields, which is truly a great phenomenon. Annual meetings held in various places are deeply welcomed, and everyone attaches great importance to them. This annual meeting has many special aspects, including a debate in addition to the reading of papers. However, due to time constraints, I was unable to attend as much as I would have liked. At the opening ceremony of the annual meeting the day before yesterday, Minister Kong mentioned that the economic recovery of the United States, while relying on the proper leadership of the government, ultimately benefited from the influence of economists. China's current economic situation has indeed reached a critical juncture, and how to find a solution is a responsibility that our society members should not shirk. Finally, I have one more hope, which is that everyone should raise more 'sons.' What I mean by 'sons' is not like what Mussolini and others advocate, which is to promote childbirth and increase the population. What I hope is that everyone can spiritually have more 'sons.' I am not just trying to drum up business for the Commercial Press and our colleagues; the publishing industry truly relies on everyone's leadership. The advancement of a country's culture is closely related to its independent survival. China's cultural undertakings and economic ideas definitely need to be promoted, so I sincerely hope that everyone can spiritually have more 'sons' and let the publishing industry shine." Liang Qingchun, director of the Hangzhou branch, then delivered a reply on behalf of the members, stating that, "Shanghai is not only an economic center but also a center of academic thought. Tonight's hosts are all leading figures in academia. Our society members should follow their example and shoulder the mission of developing Chinese academic culture to benefit the nation." The banquet concluded at around 9:00 PM with the guests and hosts parting on friendly terms.</p>
<p>Today's Excursion</p>
<p>According to the society's annual meeting schedule, members will be divided into groups today to visit scenic spots in Suzhou and Changshu. However, as it coincides with the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, many members are staying in Shanghai for the holiday, so the number of participants in the excursion is not very large. Those participating in the Suzhou group include Chen Changheng and his wife, Yuan Zhao, Tang Qingzeng, Cao Lishun, Li Boqiang, Cui Xiaocen and his wife, Hu Qingrong, Li Quanshi, Lin Xijie, Zheng Zhao, Chen Heng, Xiong Lingxiao, and Li Yunliang, among others. The Changshu group includes Long Qida, Li Binghuan, Wang Zongpei, Wang Guang, Sheng Jun, Ding Jing, Li Bojia, Ding Shengbo, Fang Hao, and others. There may be additional last-minute joiners. According to inquiries at the society's office, all members participating in the excursion must gather at the society's office in the YMCA before 7:00 AM today to depart together.</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for all members of the society at the City Hall auditorium in the city center yesterday at noon. Over 120 people attended, including Li Zhaohuan, Mu Ouchu, Wang Zhixin, Li Quanshi, Ma Yinchu, and Li Yunliang, among others. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Secretaries Zhang Tingrong, Sun Pu, Zhang Yuanruo, and Section Chief Li Dachao accompanied the Mayor. During the banquet, the Mayor delivered a welcome speech, saying, "It is a great honor for the 13th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society to be held in Shanghai. I deeply regret not being able to attend the opening ceremony due to other commitments. The society members are all economic experts and scholars who have come from afar from all parts of China, and I am very pleased. Shanghai is the economic center of China, and the relationship between various regions and Shanghai is close. I hope that you will guide the people of the whole country to carry out economic construction, promote the prosperity of Shanghai's people, and promote the prosperity of Shanghai and the revitalization of the rural areas in the interior. Society members gathered together to discuss economic issues, and I firmly believe that the future economic development of China is promising. Today, on behalf of the citizens of the city, I welcome everyone and fulfill the duties of a host. I am willing to receive everyone's guidance." Mu Ouchu then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the members, saying, "Today, we are honored to have Mayor Wu host a banquet, and I would like to thank you on behalf of all the members. The rapid progress of Shanghai's various constructions and the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan are due to the Mayor's efforts. The magnificent constructions in the city center have been witnessed by all the members, so I hope that all the members will publicize the impressions of Shanghai's construction to the interior, and use Shanghai as a model to engage in construction. Although the Mayor has tried his best to find ways to alleviate the economic downturn in Shanghai's industry and commerce, it has not achieved its goal due to the harsh environment. It is expected that in another three to five years, the Mayor's Greater Shanghai Plan can be completed, and the Mayor's wishes can be fulfilled." A group photo was then taken before everyone dispersed.</p>

<h3>Today is Mid-Autumn Festival - All Silver and Money Businesses are Closed - Foreign Exchange Rates Dropped Yesterday, Acceptance Notes Increased Sharply - All Industries Made Sufficient Preparations in Advance to Weather the Holiday</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Industry and Commerce - The Mid-Autumn Festival settlement has arrived. The silver and money businesses were busy with collections and settlements yesterday, and all extended their hours. Today, they are all closed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Extended Hours - All factories, businesses, companies, and shops that handle collections and settlements are particularly busy these days as the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement has arrived. They have sent runners day and night to collect payments from customers. The Municipal Police Bureau and the police departments of the International Settlement and the French Concession have increased the number of detectives to protect the merchants collecting payments. The silver and money businesses were busy with collections and settlements yesterday, and all extended their office hours. Today, the guilds of both industries have notified all branches and affiliated organizations that they will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>Industries are Prepared to Weather the Holiday Safely - This year's Mid-Autumn Festival is different from previous years. Because all industries have learned from the economic downturn of previous years, they have made sufficient preparations in advance to avoid unfortunate events. The foreign exchange rate in the money market was 7 fen yesterday morning and afternoon, a decrease of 1 fen from the previous day, which is sufficient proof that the money supply in Shanghai is not tight. However, the total amount exchanged at the bank clearing house increased sharply yesterday, and the number of banks applying for acceptance notes at the bank acceptance house was higher than before.</p>

<p>Cai Yuanpei left Beijing by train the night before last and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.

<h3>Situation in Hongkou and Zhabei Increasingly Relaxed Yesterday - Municipal Council Offers 5,000 Yuan Reward for Arresting the Culprit</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The situation in the North Sichuan Road and the Zhabei Six-Three Garden and Baziqiao area yesterday was the same as the previous day. Japanese soldiers inside the Japanese brewery behind the Six-Three Garden have not yet withdrawn. According to nearby residents, dozens of Japanese soldiers inside the factory must travel back and forth to the Japanese barracks three times a day for meals (because there is no dining hall or other facilities inside the factory). Japanese military vehicles carrying Japanese soldiers can often be seen traveling back and forth for this reason. The open space next to the factory was originally a desolate vegetable garden, but after the Japanese soldiers were stationed there, it was leveled yesterday morning to create a flat training ground. The factory land is owned by Japanese businessmen, and the Japanese military authorities are currently negotiating with the businessmen to move out the family members living in the factory to facilitate a long-term stay. As for the Japanese cemetery in Baziqiao, because 80 to 90 Japanese residents went to pay their respects at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai also sent ten soldiers to protect the area around the cemetery.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The situation in the Hongkou and Zhabei area gradually became peaceful yesterday. However, at around 7:00 AM, four Japanese military tanks, numbered 2, 3, 4, and 5, passed through Dixiwei Road, Qimei Road, Jiangwan Road, and Tongji Road. The Japanese troops at the wasteland at the end of Huayuan Street and the Tanaya Sake Brewery have not moved, and the coming and going of trucks has become commonplace. The construction work there has indeed been partially completed. For example, a watchtower has been built inside the Tanaya Sake Brewery, about four feet higher than the roof ridge, with a red lead sheet on top and a flagpole. The road at the end of Huayuan Street has also been extended to the wasteland and connected to the Tanaya Sake Brewery. According to eyewitnesses nearby, the Japanese troops have also dug two wells inside the factory, because there is no tap water there. At around 9:00 AM, 60 to 70 Japanese students, divided into three large trucks, were escorted by Japanese military motorcycles to visit. Later, the group of students also went to the Japanese cemetery in Baziqiao. Japanese soldiers patrolled Jiangwan Road, and three Japanese soldiers were stationed at the intersection of Tongji Road and Jiangwan Road, but they withdrew after 5:00 PM. As for the Japanese military outposts at the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road, the intersection of Dixiwei Road and Damei Road, and the Japanese Girls' School on Ouchang Road, as well as the patrolling of other roads, the situation was the same as the previous days, with no special circumstances. The various situations are reported as follows:</p>
<p>One Japanese Warship Leaves Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The No. 3 Japanese warship, which sailed to Hankou the day before yesterday, sailed to the Japanese naval pontoon bridge at Lan Ni Du in Pudong to berth, load coal, and refuel. One of them has now sailed out of the Wusongkou at 4:10 PM yesterday and headed upstream of the Yangtze River. The four torpedo boats No. 22 and the two Japanese warships No. 3 on the Jiangmian of the NingShao Wharf at Xiaodongmen, which are moored at the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, are also firing up and waiting to depart. However, as of last night, they had not yet set sail. The Kumano, Fuyo, Asagao, and other three warships from South China did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Offers a Heavy Reward to Arrest the Culprit</p>
<p>Zi Lin Daily reports: The Municipal Council's Police Department offered a reward of 5,000 yuan on Sunday to arrest the perpetrator who shot and killed one Japanese sailor and seriously injured two sailors on Wednesday night in Hongkou. Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest of the real perpetrator will be rewarded with this amount. According to Vice Superintendent and Special Political Officer of the Municipal Council Police Department, Japanese national Ta Jima (transliteration), when interviewed by a reporter yesterday (28th), claimed that the personnel investigating the murder case are working hard. However, they cannot disclose the nature of everything they have found out. He is very hopeful about the results of the investigation. The panic in Hongkou in the past few days has gradually disappeared, so the area appears to be quiet on the surface. The Japanese schools in the area and in Zhabei have resumed classes yesterday after being suspended for three days.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Request More Plainclothes Police</p>
<p>Nichinichi Mainichi Shimbun reports: At 4:00 PM on the 28th, the Shanghai Japanese Road Association held a committee meeting at the Japanese Club. In view of the urgency of the current situation, they discussed countermeasures. As a result of the agreement, they decided to petition the Municipal Council to increase the number of Japanese plainclothes police and to replace the heads of the Hongkou and Dixiwei Road police stations with Japanese nationals.</p>
<p>Worker Detained for Throwing Longan Shells</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports: On Sunday night, a worker named Li from the Xingli Bakery at No. 172 Yuqing Lane, North Sichuan Road, threw longan shells out of the window, unintentionally hitting a passing Japanese sailor. The sailor immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, and the police rushed to detain the owner of the bakery and the worker. Fortunately, two Japanese neighbors testified that the worker had thrown the shells unintentionally. However, for the sake of caution, the Public Security Bureau must wait until the Japanese naval officer expresses satisfaction with the testimony of the two Japanese neighbors before releasing the detained worker. It is expected that he will be released this afternoon (29th).</p>
<p>Two Mas Detained Request Assistance</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Two workers from the Hongxing Zhangji Printing House, Ma Yongshou and Ma Yongnian, were detained by Japanese soldiers at the Japanese military headquarters on the 23rd of this month on their way home from work, on suspicion of assassinating Japanese soldiers. They are now being transferred to the court and have lost their freedom. The manager of the printing house, Lan Sheng, sent a special letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession requesting assistance. The letter reads: "We respectfully inform you that two brothers, Ma Yongshou and Ma Yongnian, printing workers at our printing house, were detained by Japanese soldiers at the Japanese military headquarters at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road at 8:00 PM on the 23rd of this month on their way home from work. They were falsely accused of being suspects in the assassination of Japanese soldiers. On the 24th, they were handed over to the Hongkou Police Station. In the afternoon of the 24th, the police personnel escorted the two Ma brothers to our printing house for questioning. Our printing house confirmed that they were indeed workers at our printing house and had been safely working at our company before being arrested on 23rd. After our printing house's manager, Wang Lansheng, personally went to the Hongkou Police Station to apply for bail, it was rejected. On the morning of the 25th at 9:00 AM, the Hongkou Police Station transferred the case to the First Special District Court for trial. The court ruled that they should be detained for one week for investigation and further interrogation. We believe that the two Ma brothers have always been peaceful workers, with an elderly mother in her sixties and wives, children, and grandchildren below. A family of more than ten people relies entirely on the work of the two brothers to make a living. Once they are arrested and detained innocently, the livelihood of the entire family will inevitably be cut off. Therefore, we specially write to your esteemed association, hoping that you will consider that they have been unfairly burdened and that your esteemed association will protect the rights and interests of the citizens of the concession and the minimum principles of safety for residence and travel. We ask that you quickly send a letter to the Police Department of the Municipal Council and the First Special District Court, requesting a speedy investigation and bail to avoid them being unjustly burdened. This is a matter of public concern."</p>

<h3>Jiang Huaben Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Will Report to Beijing Soon</h3>
<p>Jiang Huaben, the Consul General stationed in Kobe, Japan, was transferred back to China to serve as a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 AM yesterday, accompanied by his wife, on the Japanese postal ship Tatsuta Maru. The chief of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Jue, and many relatives and friends of Jiang went to the wharf to welcome them. After landing, they went to their accommodations to rest. It is also learned that Kan'nou, the head of the Japanese Residents' Association in Shanghai, returned to Japan at the beginning of the month to report on the situation, which has now been completed, and also returned to Shanghai on the same ship yesterday. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met Jiang on the ship yesterday and discussed the following:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Commerce</p>
<p>The scope of the Kobe Consulate General is relatively wide, covering Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, and other places, all under the jurisdiction of the Kobe Consulate General. At present, there are more than 10,000 overseas Chinese in the entire area. Regarding overseas Chinese commerce, most are import and export merchants. Osaka mainly deals with the three northeastern provinces, Ping, Tianjin, and Qingdao in China, while Kobe mainly deals with various British and Dutch territories in Nanyang. In terms of scale, most are joint ventures, lacking company organizations, and their operations are mainly to transport Japanese goods for export. The import goods to China are almost all raw materials, such as medicinal materials, cotton, and cowhide. Since the emergence of the so-called "Manchukuo," the dealings between Osaka and China have mostly been replaced by Japanese people, which has had a considerable impact. At the same time, various territories in Nanyang have recently restricted Japanese goods, and the Japanese have taken the initiative to find ways to promote sales. The dealings between overseas Chinese in Kobe and Nanyang have also been greatly affected.</p>
<p>Chinese Workers Being Expelled</p>
<p>As for the overseas Chinese who have been expelled back to China in the past, most belong to the working class, such as dock workers, cloth peddlers, barbers, and cooks. According to Japanese law, all laborers must obtain permission, otherwise they will be ordered to leave the country. Most of these overseas Chinese lack knowledge and are not proficient in the Japanese language, so they are often forced to return to China. Regarding overseas Chinese education, there are currently three overseas Chinese schools in Kobe, and one each in Osaka and Kyoto.</p>
<p>China-Japan Relations</p>
<p>I believe that whether the relationship between the two countries is friendly depends on the feelings between the people of the two countries. If the people's feelings are good, then the national relationship can be harmonious. Otherwise, the national relationship will inevitably deteriorate. The current relationship between China and Japan is no exception. Japan is now promoting amity. I have sincerely told Japanese reporters that empty talk is useless. If the two countries want amity, they must be open and honest, and be able to sincerely put it into practice. I left after Mr. Wang Shoushan, the new appointee, arrived and completed the handover. Before leaving, I was unable to visit Ambassador Xu in Tokyo. After staying in Shanghai for a short period of time, I will go to Beijing to report to Foreign Minister Zhang and return to the ministry to take up my post.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Continues to Submit Donations for Purchasing Airplanes from Various Guilds - Tenth Batch - Aviation Fees for Civil Aviation Industry - Changed Collection Method</h3>
<p>Various groups and individuals in the city enthusiastically support the movement to purchase airplanes to celebrate the birthday, and they are actively donating. Details have been reported in various newspapers. The Shanghai Purchase Airplane Commemorative Committee has continued to receive the tenth batch of donations from the City Chamber of Commerce, totaling 1,600 yuan, including 1,000 yuan from the Fruit and Local Produce Industry Guild, 200 yuan from the Cotton Merchant Guild, 50 yuan from the Tea Industry Guild, 45 yuan from the Clear Oil and Rapeseed Industry Guild, and 605 yuan raised by the Woolen Fabric Factory Industry Guild, including 50 yuan each from Dadong Factory, Dade Factory, Huadong Factory, and Patriotic Factory, 20 yuan from Tongyi Factory, 15 yuan from Huadong employees, and 10 yuan each from Tianhe Factory, Tiansheng Factory, Jinglun Factory, Shenchang Factory, and Dada Factory, and 5 yuan each from Shengda Factory, Gongchang Factory, Jianchang Factory, and Daxing Factory. All have been acknowledged and thanked.</p>
<p>The entire city's shipping industry previously proposed collecting aviation fees to support the aviation salvation movement. The head of the China Aviation Association's General Team Office convened a meeting with the industry to discuss the matter and obtained the approval of the Shanghai Municipal Government for issuance. It started on December 10th of last year, but the results were mediocre. Starting in May of this year, it was requested that the Treasury Department's Ship Tax Office collect the fees on its behalf. The details have been reported in various newspapers. In order to reduce the burden on the shipping industry, the General Team Leader Office specially wrote to the Treasury Department, inviting the Fengguan Section and the heads of various ship tax offices to discuss the matter at the department at 2:00 PM on the 15th. The meeting was chaired by General Secretary Li Dachao, who decided on the spot to collect the aviation fees only once and have the Ship Tax Office continue to collect them on its behalf. The Municipal Government was requested to issue a notice, and the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team was requested to assist. The collection standards were set at 5 jiao for first to second class ships, 1 yuan for third to fifth class ships, 2 yuan for sixth to eighth class ships, and 3 yuan for ninth to twelfth class ships. The collection period is from October 1st to the end of November. All civilian ships in Shanghai must be collected on schedule. It is heard that the Municipal Government has approved the record and issued a notice, which will officially start tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Citizen Certificates Issued to Members of Various Guilds Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Assembly Representative Election Office has completed the citizen oath process, and citizen certificates have been prepared separately. Yesterday, citizen certificates for members of various guilds of the Chamber of Commerce were sent to the City Chamber of Commerce, and personnel were sent to supervise the process. The City Chamber of Commerce notified the members of various guilds to present receipts and go to the Chamber to collect their certificates.</p>
<h3>Vietnam's Hehe Levies Taxes on Chinese Goods - Ministry Orders Saigon Consul to Negotiate - National Goods Association Replies to Vietnam National Goods Company Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association replied to the Shanghai Office of the Vietnam China National Goods Company yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, we have received a document from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated September 25th of this year, Ou Zi No. 8854, regarding a report dated September 18th, 25th year of the Republic of China, concerning the Vietnamese Customs' imposition of harsh import taxes on Chinese goods.

<h3>Overseas Chinese Remittances Home Total 300 Million Yuan in Eight Months, Similar to Last Year</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that our country's foreign trade deficit mainly relies on remittances from overseas Chinese to make up for it. In recent years, due to the oppression of overseas Chinese by the local authorities in various places, the amount of remittances home has decreased year by year. The Bank of China and other domestic banks have detailed statistics on this. According to inquiries by a reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency, the total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese to China in the past eight months, from January to August of this year, was 300 million yuan, which is about the same as last year.</p>

<h3>Baihe River Water Level Drops, Fenpu Runs Aground, Only 13 Feet at the Lightship, Ships Dispatched to Unload Cargo</h3>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Restores Inland River Machine Factory, Commissioner Lan Jian Departs for Hankou Today</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's inland river machine factory, since the Shanghai factory ceased operations in April of this year, has moved all machinery and other items to Hankou in order to repair the Yangtze River vessels. The factory site in Shanghai is certainly not as convenient as in Hankou. Now, the factory's machines are still intact and well-maintained, and efforts are being made to resume operations in order to provide repairs for the bureau's vessels. The complete statistics for the restoration of various machines, the layout of the Hankou factory site, and the configuration of spare parts and required projects have been carefully reviewed and calculated by the bureau, requiring more than 93,000 yuan. With the approval of the ministry, the bureau has specially appointed Zhou Houkun, deputy director of the bureau's shipping department, and Zhuo Jun, commissioner of the inland river machine factory, as supervisors of the factory's restoration. All procedures have been negotiated with Cao Shoulian, director of the inland river machine factory, in recent days. Mr. Zhou and Mr. Zhuo are scheduled to take the bureau's river vessel to Hankou today to implement the supervision of the inland river machine factory's restoration work. All factory workers, in addition to a portion who will travel from Shanghai, will be hired in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Two Detainees Escape, Guard Sentenced, 50 Days Detention</h3>
<p>Jiang Wanyuan, a bailiff from the Fifth Division of the Second Special District Court, originally from Yangzhou, was escorting criminal detainees to the waiting room behind the First Tribunal on the morning of the 15th of this month, awaiting trial, when he carelessly left the key to the door in the lock of the back door of the waiting room. As a result, the detainees Wu Asan and Wang Agen seized the opportunity to use the key to open the back door, pry open the iron gate on the iron fence, and escape without a trace at around 2:00 PM. When it was discovered, there was no way to pursue them. The foreign chief judicial constable reported to the president of the court, and Bailiff Jiang was detained and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Wang Ren concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution against Jiang in the criminal court for the crime of negligent escape under Article 163, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Chen Shuoying, together with the prosecutor, held a court hearing and concluded the inquiry. The circumstances of the scheduled pronouncement of the sentence have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, the judgment was delivered. At 2:00 PM, Judge Chen and Prosecutor Wang arrived at Criminal Tribunal 2, ordered the defendant Jiang Wanyuan to be brought to the case, briefly questioned his age and origin, and then announced the judgment: Jiang Wanyuan was sentenced to 50 days of detention. Jiang immediately declared that he accepted the judgment and waived the right to appeal. The official then ordered him to be returned to custody to await execution.</p>

<h3>Jin Tai Money Exchange, Important Account Books Missing, Supervisor Sues Manager, Dispute Arises Over Re-Pledging of Title Deeds, Conflicting Accounts on Where the Books Are</h3>
<p>Li Zicheng, originally from Ningbo, formerly partnered with Yu Zuoting, Qi Ziquan, Sun Jieqing, Ye Zengshou, and Xue Chunsheng to open the Jin Tai Money Exchange at No. 8 Zhongde Lane, 449 Beijing Road. They appointed Lin Pingfu, also from Ningbo and the current manager of the Guotai Bank, as manager, while Li served as supervisor. Recently, the Xinyuan Money Exchange, through a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Jin Tai Exchange and Li Zicheng, among others, seeking compensation for damages. The grounds for the lawsuit were that Xinyuan had invested 30,000 yuan in Jin Tai Exchange and several Ningbo money exchanges to jointly establish Yongtai Company, specializing in the pawn business.</p>
<p>In November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the title deed for Sun Chunsheng's two mu, one li, and one hao of land was received as a pawn. Last year, Jin Tai secretly pledged it to the Central Bank, obtaining 340,000 yuan. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed. During the ongoing litigation, Li Zicheng examined the red account books of Jin Tai Exchange for previous years and found no accounts for joint investment in Shui Tai Company, nor any record of pledging the Yongtai pawned title deed to the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Clearly, there were irregularities.</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, Li sent a letter to Lin Pingfu, demanding to inspect the account books of Jin Tai within three days. On the 9th, he went with an accountant surnamed Zhang to check the accounts, but Lin refused. Li then filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court to preserve the evidence. On the 14th of the month, Lin suddenly sent a letter to Li, saying that the account books of Jin Tai had been taken away by Li. On the 21st, Wang Zuo, a bailiff from the court, and others went to the exchange to retrieve the account books. They found two boxes of account books downstairs and</p>
<p>Three boxes of account books upstairs,</p>
<p>And a carrying case. After checking by Accountant Zhang, important books such as the general ledger and daily journal were not included. Li then hired Lawyer He Xiaoyuan to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the First Special Court against Lin Pingfu for destruction of documents, requesting that he be punished according to Article 325 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard by Judge Dai Rongduo in Criminal Tribunal 5. The defendant, Lin Pingfu, arrived with his defense attorney, Fang Jiazhen</p>
<p>To respond to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiff, Li Zicheng, stated the above facts, saying that he had repeatedly requested the account books from the defendant, but the defendant claimed that they had been destroyed in a fire or that they had been taken away by him, so he filed a complaint. Then Lawyer Shan stated that the plaintiff had a common act with the Jin Tai Exchange accountant Ma Kaishu, so he added a complaint, requesting that they be summoned and investigated together. Judge Dai then stated that regarding the</p>
<p>Lawsuit against Ma</p>
<p>The complaint had been received, but because there was not enough time, a summons had not been issued today. It will be delivered next time. When questioned, Lin Pingfu confessed that after the Xinyuan lawsuit occurred, the plaintiff repeatedly requested the account books from him on the 9th of this month. The plaintiff was the supervisor of the exchange, and he was subject to his command and supervision. Also, the plaintiff often came to get the account books, so on the 11th, he</p>
<p>Important documents</p>
<p>1,011 books in total, packed in six leather cases, were handed over to him to take away. The account books taken away by the court bailiff were all secondary books from previous years, and all the books were already in the plaintiff's possession. Why would he ask me for them again? Furthermore, the fact of the Central Bank pledge arose in late December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, when the Dingfeng Sand Factory, run by the plaintiff, was in urgent need of funds and asked me to find a way. However, at that time, credit was tight and there was no way to raise funds. The plaintiff then ordered the</p>
<p>Title Deed Pledged</p>
<p>I then made arrangements through traffic and pledged the title deed for 250,000 yuan, which was later returned 70,000 yuan. By the end of June of the 24th year, during the financial crisis, it was again pledged to the Central Bank for 340,000 yuan. The red accounts and others have records of this, etc. His lawyer also stated that the defendant has now filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against the plaintiff, Li Zicheng, in this case, demanding the delivery of the account books. Therefore, the question of who has the account books in this case should be strictly investigated, etc. Judge Dai decided that the case still needed to be investigated, so he changed the date for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Repercussions of the Municipal Council's Increased Donation Rates, Yongchangtai Customs Brokerage Firm Asks the Ratepayers Association for Support</h3>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the Yongtai Chang Customs Brokerage Firm, located at 22 Changgeng Lane, 158 Edward Road, in the Public Concession, sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, stating: "Respectfully, our firm has leased a municipal house at No. 22, Lane 158, Edward Road, since February 1st of this year, with a monthly rent of 500 yuan. According to the current regulations of the Municipal Council, the annual municipal general donation should be 840 yuan. However, the Municipal Council is either unaware of the high rents of the past, or mistakenly believes that the cost of business equipment and decoration is a prepaid rent for an additional burden, or misunderstands Article 5 of the contract, and arbitrarily assesses the value of our firm's rent and forcibly increases it. In order to protect the interests of taxpayers and respect the current donation rate, our firm has repeatedly argued on reasonable grounds, but has ultimately failed to obtain the understanding of the Municipal Council. We hereby present the circumstances to your association." We believe that the leaders of our Chinese taxpayers association will be able to uphold justice and safeguard the rights and interests of our Chinese taxpayers. Initially, the Municipal Council notified our firm to come for a discussion, stating that our firm's house donation must be paid according to the donation amount before February 1st. Later, it said that at least it must be paid according to an annual rent of 8,000 yuan. Then, it said that out of consideration for the difficulties of business, it would be reduced to an annual rent of 7,400 yuan. After hearing this, our firm was extremely shocked. The Municipal Council should collect taxes according to the regulations. How can it arbitrarily change them? We immediately explained the actual situation to the bureau and explained the misunderstanding. However, the Municipal Council sent a letter on April 20th, stating that the donation amount must be calculated according to a monthly rent of 625 yuan. The reasons given were: "(1) When the Municipal Council believes that the rent does not match the value of the house, it has the right to re-estimate its value and collect taxes; (2) Although the lease states that the monthly rent is 500 yuan, there is an additional burden of 3,000 yuan for business equipment and decoration, which must be included in the total rent." After further explanation by letter, and submitting a copy of the lease contract and various documents regarding the 3,000 yuan for business equipment and decoration for reference, the bureau misunderstood the meaning of Article 5 of the contract, insisting that this 3,000 yuan was a prepaid rent. Although repeated letters were sent, it was not understood. In fact, this 3,000 yuan is the price our firm paid to the former tenant, Tiantaicheng Customs Brokerage Firm, for business equipment and decoration, which initially had nothing to do with the landlord, and there is no obligation to return it to the landlord when the lease expires. Article 5 of the lease states that decorations that come with the house may not be removed after expiration, otherwise, they must be restored to their original form. The reason why they are not allowed to be removed is actually a modified condition for the original tenant to restore the decorations to their original form before taking over. Moreover, business equipment and decoration are different, and a large part of this 3,000 yuan is the price of business equipment and decoration, so it should be distinguished and cannot be confused. The Municipal Council misunderstands again and again, ignores the decline of the market, the sharp drop in rents, and insists on going its own way, which is not a way to be considerate of the difficulties of business. Now the amount of our firm's rent has been confirmed by the court based on the rent value of neighboring houses, and the Municipal Council's valuation is considered to be legitimate. We have already appealed this seemingly correct argument. Please consider the situation and uphold justice, then the beneficiaries will not only be our firm, but also the residents and shops in this concession will all benefit. Otherwise, the Municipal Council will arbitrarily increase or decrease the tax based on one-sided views, and the harm will be endless. We are sending copies of our firm's correspondence with the Municipal Council and our appeal letter, and respectfully request your association to provide assistance. We deeply hope and pray for this. To the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association."</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Designated Hospitals Offer Free Smallpox Vaccinations</h3>
<p>Now that summer has passed and autumn has arrived, the weather is unpredictable, and smallpox often occurs in children. If mild, it can cause pockmarks and blindness, and if severe, it can lead to death. Matters of life and death should not be ignored. Therefore, the authorities are devising ways to provide relief. The Public Concession Municipal Council Health Department has now designated the Hongkou Civilian Obstetrics Hospital and the Chinese Hospital to provide completely free smallpox vaccinations starting on October 1st. These two hospitals have always been charitable, and even pregnant women with limited funds who come to the hospital to give birth can receive free care and daily medical treatment. This time, the smallpox vaccine is fresh. Parents of all circles should fulfill their responsibility to protect their children and not be negligent. The hospital's telephone number is 50936, and it is located at the intersection of Ward Road in Tilanqiao.</p>

<h3>Principal Offender in Forging House Donation, Fan Xinsheng, Interrogated and Concluded, Sentence to be Pronounced on October 3rd</h3>
<p>Fan Xinsheng, a Teochew native who was formerly a preparatory committee member of the South Goods Trade Association and is now a shareholder and manager of the Yuanlai South Goods Store on Baidang Road, Xujiahui, forged house donation tickets of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau with the late Shan Mengsheng, who also worked in the association, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, to defraud residents of money. The Finance Bureau arrested Shan, copied out the evidence, and sent him to the Local Court. Shan confessed that Fan was the mastermind. The court</p>
<p>Filed a joint public prosecution. Shan Mengsheng was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, while Fan's trial was suspended because he was at large. It would be handled after he was apprehended. The Finance Bureau offered a reward for the arrest of Fan Xinsheng. Fan fled to the countryside. This year, believing that the matter had subsided, he returned to Shanghai and took on the position of manager of a South Goods store. Unexpectedly, someone received the reward and reported him to the Finance Bureau, who requested the Public Security Bureau to arrest Fan and send him to the Local Court. Because it was an old case, it was directly tried and detained by Judge Yu Lude. Yesterday's continuation of the interrogation: Fan Xinsheng confessed that he was 28 years old, lived at No. 1490 Ximen, and was a South Goods merchant. He was formerly a preparatory committee member of the South Goods Association. The official asked if Yao Bingsheng, a witness, was the one you designated to summon? He replied, yes. The official asked, in April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, did you call Shan Mengsheng to take the house donation ticket from Gu Ansheng? He replied, no. The official asked, was it later taken back by Gu's father from Shan? He replied, no. The official asked, do you wear a suit? He replied, I wore it when I was studying, but not later. The official then ordered him to write the formal and cursive versions of the numbers one to ten in court, as well as</p>
<p>Uppercase and lowercase forms, and more than 20 words, including Xianshi Ancestral Hall and Anle Lane, to compare with the handwriting on the house donation tickets. At this point, he was asked if the South Goods Trade Association was established in June of the 22nd year? He replied, it was established earlier. The official asked, how many desks were there? He replied, there were three desks in the office for permanent staff. The official asked, was Shan Mengsheng's desk facing yours? He replied, no. The official asked, did Shan Mengsheng's father come to take the house donation ticket stub book, seeing you were copying it? He replied, no, I am a</p>
<p>Legitimate merchant. I was an auditor in the Yichang North Goods Firm on Yanghang Street and helped my father with village affairs. My father is a shareholder in Yichang. After the Finance Bureau came to search my house, I issued a letter and asked Lawyer Yao Zhaoli to publish it in the newspaper. (He then presented the Shen Bao from June 23rd of the 22nd year.) I have nothing to do with fraudulently collecting house donations. The official said, according to what you said, is this really reasonable? The Finance Bureau had already offered a reward for your arrest, and you still dared to work in the association? Why didn't you go to the court to declare it? He replied, my father didn't allow me to go to the case and told me to go to</p>
<p>Huzhou Township. At this point, the victim Li Gu's family testified that she was 41 years old, from Changzhou, and lived at No. 2 Dexing Lane behind Yishiyuan. Jin Yan's family testified that she was 37 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 12 Dexing Lane. Zhao Lu's family testified that she was 40 years old, from Pinghu, and lived at No. 8 Dexing Lane. They all paid for the fake house donation tickets because the amounts were very accurate. As for the person who came to collect the donations, he was tall and thin and wore a suit. He could not be identified now. At this point, the witness Jin Bingting testified that he was 31 years old, from Jiangxi, and a director of the South Goods Association on Ninghe Road. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he</p>
<p>Served as a clerk. Fan Xinsheng was also a clerk. He was asked, how many desks were there in the 23rd year? He replied that at that time, there were two desks on Fuyou Road. My clerk Ye Wenhuan and I faced each other. Fan and Shan Mengsheng faced each other. The Finance Bureau copied out 173 blue slips from Shan's desk drawer. At this point, the witness Yu Yaoqiu, the current cadre of the Municipal Party Headquarters, formerly a South Goods merchant, testified as a standing committee member. Fan Xinsheng. Shan Mengsheng. Were both introduced by Wu Xiaoxiang. Because Wu was not good, I fired them, etc. At this point, Yao Bingsheng testified that he was 31 years old, from Shanghai. Shan Mengsheng</p>
<p>Is my nephew. He served six months in prison for fraudulently collecting house donations. Because he was unemployed, I introduced him to work at the Gonghe Automobile Company in January of this year. I met Fan, and Fan blamed him for not falsely accusing him. Mengsheng begged me to apologize to Fan. Mengsheng left on August 4th of this year. Fan is the manager of the Yuanlai South Goods Store. I went to Fan's house on Zhonghua Road, Ximen, on the morning of the 4th to apologize. His wife was also there. At this point, the official suddenly brought Fan to the case and asked Fan where he apologized. Fan confessed that Yao and Shan came to the Yuanlai store in Xujiahui together. It was in the afternoon. My wife lives at No. 73 Xiaoyou Lane behind the store. At this point, the official's debate ended, and the sentence will be pronounced on October 3rd. Fan Xinsheng was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Chinese and British Buses Agreed to Extend the Route, Implemented on October 1st</h3>

<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Hosts Banquet for Zhu Baolin</h3>
<p>Dr. Zhu Baolin, the son of Mr. Zhu Gengtao, a leader in Shanghai's industry, returned to China on the 8th of this month after studying medicine in Europe and the United States and obtaining a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in the United States. Zhu's relatives and friends, as well as various groups, have been holding welcome banquets for him in recent days, making him very busy. Last night, Dr. Zhu attended a welcome banquet hosted by the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association and the Reorganization Committee at the New Asia Restaurant, with more than 100 people in attendance. During the banquet, Xie Keming gave a welcoming speech (speech omitted). Dr. Zhu reported on his medical experiences and the medical conditions in Europe and the United States. Finally, Mr. Zhu Gengtao gave a reply, stating that Baolin went to Europe and the United States to study medicine with the intention of improving himself. He should sincerely contribute his experience and knowledge to society and serve the people. However, medicine and happiness are related. Western medicine now requires Western drugs, and the annual expenditure of money is immeasurable. It is hoped that Western doctors can study and use scientific methods with Chinese medicinal materials to imitate Western products and replace Western music, so as to recover the leakage of dikes. I sincerely hope this is not a dream. Therefore, I urge Baolin to work hard and research to create guidance for medicine and to live up to everyone's expectations, etc. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, and the banquet ended at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital, August Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's August report for this year states: Outpatient numbers: 16,623; New inpatients: 365; Total inpatient days: 6,411; Average daily meals served: 460; Male suicide attempts: 56; Female suicide attempts: 53; Emergency surgeries: 433; Emergency surgeries due to factory accidents: 31; Patients sent by the Public Concession police: 513; Patients sent by the French Concession police: 79; Deliveries: 23. Judging from the above statistics, the hospital's work in August was roughly equivalent to that of the previous month. Among the above categories, some slightly increased compared to July, while others slightly decreased. The utilization of the obstetrics department has shown significant popularization effects. Delivery numbers were ten in July and have increased to 23 in August. In addition to the increased record of delivery numbers, the hospital serves the entire community by providing a prenatal clinic for pregnant women. Some pregnant women come to the hospital for consultation several months before delivery, while others book beds two months in advance. During the antepartum period, pregnant women receive thorough diagnosis, treatment, and guidance from the hospital. A pediatric health check clinic has also been established within the obstetrics department. Parents are often seen bringing their babies to the clinic for check-ups. The hospital staff observes the progress of the babies' health and provides guidance on common infant care methods, such as bathing and feeding, making a significant contribution to the well-being of society, especially infants. The nursing training school admitted 17 new female students in August. The class must undergo a short probationary period before being formally admitted to receive full nursing training. Miss Goole has worked diligently for five years and has now been granted leave and left Shanghai. However, Miss Evans has joined the senior nursing staff. Miss Evans recently completed a one-year course at the Suzhou Language School. The hospital's board of directors has been studying the hospital's financial situation and is quite concerned because the hospital relies heavily on property income. Recently, due to the economic downturn in the city, tenants have often failed to pay rent on time. The hospital’s economic income for this year, up to the present time, has decreased by 21% compared to the same period last year, which is a serious situation. They are now trying their best to balance income and expenditure.</p>

<h3>Shrewdness in Setting up a Bookbinding Shop on Jingzhou Road, Investigation Reveals Arson, Boss Zhang Xiangguan and Others Arrested, Police Prosecute to the Court</h3>
<p>In the attic on the upper floor of Heji Bookbinding Shop at No. 11, Lane 406, Jingzhou Road, a fire suddenly broke out at about 1:00 AM the other morning. Zhang Amao, a woman from Shaoxing from No. 9 next door, woke up and went outside to shout for help. The printing shop at No. 1 in the same lane telegraphed the Yulin Road police station, which sent Chinese detective Pan Yunlong and the fire brigade in charge to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Part of it had already been burned. Zhang Xiangguan, the old man from Zhenjiang who owned the bookbinding shop, and Ni Dingyu were taken to the police station for investigation and were detained after arson was discovered. Yesterday morning, Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, said when he was escorted to the Criminal Third Court of the First Special District Court that the Heji Bookbinding Shop was previously opened by Wen Huanzhang and was transferred to the two defendants for 600 yuan on the 10th of this month. These people then insured 6,000 yuan of fire insurance with New World Insurance at No. 17 Huangpu Road on the Bund. The Hong family, who lived upstairs, also had 1,000 yuan of fire insurance. Before the incident, they gave 12 apprentices in the shop two yuan each for dinner and told them to go to the New New Company on Nanjing Road to play and told them to return to the shop after it closed. Jiang Sanlin, who worked in the shop, also went to a friend's place on the same road to play mahjong. By the time the apprentices and Jiang returned to the shop, the fire had been extinguished. At that time, only Zhang's wife, Mao, and another apprentice, Zhang Maoer, were in the shop. The two defendants denied it at the police station, but the arson was very obvious. Please detain them for detailed investigation, etc. Then, Zhang Amao, a woman next door, testified that the defendant Zhang Xiangguan was standing at the back door of her house at that time and said to her, "There is no need to call the police station." She then asked someone from the printing shop at No. 1 to call the police, etc. The apprentices Zhu Angui, Mao Hangen, Xu Jinpei, and Jiang Sanlin, who worked in the shop, said that they were all playing at the New New Company and playing cards at a friend's place when the fire broke out and did not know about it. When questioned, Zhang and Ni stammered in their confessions. Judge Xiao Xie asked that they still be detained and rescheduled for investigation.</p>

<h3>Three Cases Against Tongyi Trust Company Concluded, Judgment Expected Next Friday</h3>
<p>After the collapse of Tongyi Trust Company, in addition to those that have already been judged, there are still three cases in which all directors and supervisors were accused of violating the Company Law and the Savings Bank Law, etc., filed by Lu Tangcha and others.

Only four defendants, Xu Jiqun, Zhou Shouliang, Guo Yushang, and Chuan Zhuyin, surrendered themselves. Jiang Liuzhi still claimed to be ill and was represented in court by a lawyer. The remaining defendants, Huang Suchu, etc., were nowhere to be found. The court questioned Xu and others once, and then ordered the debate to begin. First, the lawyers Zhang Yifan and others for the plaintiffs spoke, stating that there is no distinction in the Company Law between performing business and not performing business. All directors must bear equal responsibility. Then, Xu Shihaho, the defense lawyer for the two defendants Xu and Zhou, defended Xu and Zhou, saying that Xu and Zhou were ordinary directors and were not responsible for all actions within the company. He requested that they be declared not guilty. If the court believes that they are not without criminal suspicion, they are also continuous offenders, and the various charges sued in this case have all been judged in the previous case. In terms of procedure, this case can be prosecuted and should not be accepted. Then, the lawyer for Guo Yushang defended Guo, which was roughly similar to what Xu's lawyer said. Finally, the lawyers for the two defendants Jiang and Chuan defended, saying that Jiang and Chuan were supervisors, and the accusations made by the plaintiffs were mostly against directors, and their duties were irrelevant to the supervisors, etc. After the debate, Judge Ye ordered that the judgment be announced next Friday.</p>
<h3>New Invention, Electric Essence Lamp Born</h3>
<p>Gao Jinshan and Weng Renyong from Zhejiang, feeling that villages and towns without power plants are not as brightly lit as large cities late at night, which hinders municipal development, transportation, popularization of education, etc., were determined to find a way to solve this problem. After immersing themselves in research, they invented an electric essence lamp last spring. The style is no different from the current electric lamp, but it does not require dry batteries or hydroelectric power, nor does it need gasoline or kerosene. The installation does not need to be fixed at a location and can be moved at will. The strength and switching on and off of the light can all be done as desired. It is exquisite, ingenious, simple, and economical, and is still a novel invention in the world. From now on, remote rural areas can be brightly lit, and travel will not be afraid of darkness. It can truly be called a new invention that benefits the country and the people. Since Gao and Weng organized the Guangming Electric Essence Lamp Factory and set up a distribution office in the Renli district of Nanyang Ju Nandun in this city, it is heard that distributors from all over the country have come in droves, and supply cannot meet demand. The factory has great difficulty coping with the situation. This is also good news for domestic goods.</p>

<h3>Foreign Shareholders of Meihua Bank Rejected in Lawsuit Because Foreign Shareholders Are Not Victims, They Are Not Allowed to File a Private Prosecution According to Law</h3>
<p>After the collapse of Meihua Bank, which was founded by Gu Yubo and others, the foreign shareholder and chairman of the bank, Englishman Meng Lei, and the shareholders and directors Yale and Malaito, etc., originally each subscribed for one share, but they did not pay a penny of their 100 yuan share capital. In fact, the three of them did not suffer any losses. However, they jointly filed a criminal private prosecution against Gu Yubo, Chen Yizai, and Bao Ziwen, Chinese shareholders, in the First Special District District Court for breach of trust and fraud, and also filed a related civil suit, demanding compensation for losses. After repeated court hearings, because Gu had absconded, he had been wanted. Although Chen and Bao had not surrendered, the matters sued by Meng Lei and others had been thoroughly investigated and the case was concluded. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng held a court session and announced the main text of the judgment, stating that the case would not be accepted and the lawsuit of the plaintiff in the related civil suit was rejected. Judge Huang also briefly stated the reasons in court, saying that because the private prosecutor was not the victim, he was not allowed to file a private prosecution according to law, so it should not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Zhao Yu-Huang's New Book on Pharmacy Published</h3>
<p>Domestic medicinal materials have the most scientific research value and are the most complex and chaotic, making research the most difficult. In recent years, there have been many people in China studying Chinese medicine, but most do not pay attention to the study of pharmacognosy and instead engage in pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmacology. This has led to many errors in the basic problems of Chinese medicine without being noticed. This is a huge obstacle in medicine. Mr. Zhao Yu-Huang has been devoted to this field for thirty years. Since leaving Academia Sinica and being hired by the Peking Research Institute, he has begun to organize medicinal materials from North China, collecting more than 2,800 specimens. He uses the latest research methods of pharmacognosy to verify and discover with ancient herbal texts, laying a scientific foundation for China's thousands of years of traditional medicine and increasing its efficiency. This is a great contribution to the study of Chinese medicine. The results of the research have been published in the first volume of "Qizhou Medicinal Materials," a study of the pharmacognosy of the Compositae and Dipsacaceae (Umbelliferae) families. A total of twelve volumes have been successfully studied. The first volume is priced at four yuan and is published by the Publishing Department of the Peking Research Institute.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Products Special Issue</p>
<h3>Eliminating Unhealthy Psychological Attitudes of Housewives in the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xuan</p>
<p>(1) Greed for Cheapness: Taking advantage is a common unhealthy psychological attitude shared by both men and women. Money should be cherished, and goods should be chosen for their low price. However, the opposite of cheapness is loss, and cheapness and loss are proportional. In other words, cheapness is equal to loss. If cheapness and loss are not equal, then it is not cheapness. We know that the National Products Movement and housewives have a close relationship, and women's greed for cheapness is even more severe than men's. Therefore, when they see goods that are new in design, fashionable, and cheap in price, they ultimately do not distinguish whether they are domestic products or not and buy them casually. Unscrupulous merchants take advantage of their greed for cheapness to obtain money. As a result, money flows out of the country in countless amounts. In fact, this unhealthy psychological attitude is too harmful to the national livelihood and can be said to be worse than the trade deficit. You must know that if you are greedy for some cheapness, you will suffer a great loss in economic invasion, becoming an inverse proportion. This is a small matter, but you will also receive the gifts of enemy artillery fire and bombs! Isn't that greatly not cheap? Therefore, I sincerely advise those who have a greedy heart, for the sake of national livelihood and the future, and for the sake of the National Products Movement, if you do not want to be slaves, swear to eradicate and thoroughly change this unhealthy psychological attitude of greed for cheapness. Housewives! You should especially correct it if you have it, and encourage yourself if you don't!</p>
<p>(2) Complacency: You must not be complacent about anything, especially not about national products. If a person gets used to complacency, they will be careless. Moreover, now that smuggled goods are rampant and counterfeit goods are rampant, if you are also complacent! Who cares if it is a domestic product or not! Just buy it and be done with it. You must know that if you are so complacent, it will be terrible! To be honest, such a large China can also be lost on the word "complacency"! Complacency is to fail to fulfill the national duty and not to fulfill the national obligation. You must know that "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Adopting domestic products and not buying non-domestic products is one of the national defense policies, so everyone must do it. Housewives buying non-domestic products due to complacency is unknown in China, where education and knowledge are not widespread. I hope that knowledgeable housewives will not only encourage themselves but also promote and advise other housewives. Moreover, although parents are both role models for children, mothers occupy an important position. Upon careful examination, most housewives and children linger at foreign toy stalls and shops, and complacently buy foreign goods to satisfy children's childish desires. Isn't this harming the future of children and also a result of the unhealthy psychological effect of "complacency"? This kind of influence expands its power invisibly and is really hard to guard against! The above two points are very simple to say and everyone knows and feels them, but it is often easy to violate them like being infected by what you see and hear. The foundation of domestic products must be laid well. I hope housewives will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>A Few Words of Contribution</p>
<h3>A Dedicated Speech for the National Products Exhibition of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is holding a large-scale National Products Exhibition at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Commodity Exhibition Hall. More than 150 manufacturers are participating, and the opening is scheduled for October 1st. It is of great significance that a legitimate industrial and commercial group is holding this grand gathering during this critical period of national crisis. In addition to our joy, we would like to offer three points to the people of Shanghai and the gentlemen who are hosting this event.</p>
<p>(1) Observe this Exhibition with a Progressive Perspective: The products in this exhibition have improved rapidly compared to previous exhibitions. Some products, which were previously not produced domestically, are now on display at the exhibition, gradually reaching a state of self-sufficiency from the process of relying on imports. Although it is still not perfect due to material resources, talent, and financial resources, it is fair to say that the domestic products industry has been able to struggle and fight amidst countless hardships to achieve this kind of achievement. If given more time, on the one hand, they will gather talents to improve technology, and on the other hand, they will provide financial assistance to ensure sufficient strength. The achievements will be immeasurable. This is the first point.</p>
<p>(2) Promote the Improvement of National Products with Honest Criticism: It is heard that after the exhibition, experts will be invited to conduct a review as a preparation for awards. We believe that the criticism of a few people is not as good as the criticism of many people. Using the eyes of the public, which is superior, which is secondary, what should be improved, and what should be changed? We hope that the gentlemen attending the exhibition will provide honest criticism for the reference of each factory to improve. This is of great importance to promoting the progress of industry. We hope that the people of Shanghai will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(3) Do Your Best to Promote National Products with a Loving Mentality: We are very gratified to see so many products and so much progress in the domestic products industry. If there are any shortcomings, we should forgive them and do our best to promote them and open up avenues for them with a mentality of loving domestic products. Identify the primary importance of saving the country in promoting domestic products, and treat the producers with respect and love, giving them sufficient progress and full development, and then complete the national duty. All three points should be understood by the domestic products industry itself, which should also understand the importance of its own responsibility, strive for excellence, and strive for beauty to compete with foreign goods, so that the holding of this exhibition will be more meaningful.</p>
<h3>The Mid-Autumn Festival and National Products</h3>
<p>— Qing Bo</p>
<p>The clock hand is like a bird in the sky, flying away in an instant, and finally disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>Memories of the Mid-Autumn Festival of youth seem to be still in front of us, and this year's Mid-Autumn Festival has quickly arrived again in an instant. The rapid passage of time really gives us young people endless feelings.</p>
<p>These few days, if we have free time, we can stroll around the streets. Then, you will surely see many people crowding in and out of major companies, holding bundles and packages in their hands. What are these people busy with? What exactly are they busy with? The author is really inexplicable. Then I thought: That's right! That's right! The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming in a few days, and people are rational and emotional animals. How can they not buy some things to send to their dear relatives and friends to express the friendship between the two parties?</p>
<p>Indeed, "Every festive season brings more thoughts of loved ones!" For the sons who are wandering outside for a living, now that the Mid-Autumn Festival is about to arrive, they should indeed buy some things to take home to please their parents and comfort their wives and young children. This is also human nature, and can we give them any criticism?</p>
<p>However, fellow citizens who are purchasing gifts: We must know, what era is this? How serious is our economic national crisis now? How serious is the invasion of foreign goods and the rampant smuggling of private goods? When we are purchasing gifts and all supplies, we should firmly remember the two big words "National Products". Whether it is for eating, using, or wearing, whether it is for gifts or for self-use, no matter what, we should take purchasing national products as the standard. No matter how beautiful or cheap foreign goods are, we must stick to our principles and swear not to shake hands with them. Only in this way can our economic national crisis be resolved one day. Only in this way can the invasion of foreign goods and the rampant smuggling of private goods have the possibility of decline. This is a point that all fellow citizens across the country should deeply understand when purchasing gifts for the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Finally, the author has some additional opinions to offer. That is, when fellow citizens across the country are advocating national products with great enthusiasm, we should especially pay attention to the question of "Is this a national product?" when we give gifts to others. Because we are giving national products as gifts to others, on the one hand, we are respecting the other party, and at the same time, we are respecting ourselves. On the contrary, if we give imported goods to relatives and friends, it is no different from insulting the other person's personality, and at the same time, it is insulting our own personality. If you run into a very real friend, I am afraid they will return it to you intact and write a note to teach you a lesson. At that time, I ask: What fun is there in this?</p>
<p>Ladies who are busy purchasing gifts for the Mid-Autumn Festival, please carefully consider my opinions!</p>

<p>(7) (7) Annual Meeting of the General Association of Chinese Students in Europe</p>
<p>Before ending the "Records of the Journey," a detailed report on the situation of the second annual meeting of the "General Association of Chinese Students in Europe" should be made to the readers, because the students in Europe have helped the delegation a lot this time. It can be said that they are an important member of the delegation's expedition. Furthermore, the situation of the students studying abroad must also be of concern to the readers.</p>
<p>History of the General Association of Students</p>
<p>The history of China sending young students to study abroad is as long as that of Japan. The efforts of Japanese students completed the great task of the Meiji Restoration, and now they are famous all over the world. Although Chinese students have also made many contributions to the motherland, they cannot be compared with Japan, and they are far from the expectations of the Chinese people. The reasons are roughly two points: First, there is no close connection between the government and the students studying abroad. Often the government needs talents but cannot find them. At the same time, students with specialized knowledge often do not have the opportunity to contribute their talents after returning to China, forming a contradictory phenomenon. Second, the factions among students studying abroad are divided, and the concept of "family" is very deep. Not only can they not cooperate, but they also exclude each other. If we want to make the students studying abroad truly contribute to the country, we must eliminate these two defects, otherwise there is no hope forever. Students studying in various European countries have student organizations in many countries. In recent years, they feel that it is necessary to expand these small organizations and to melt the emotions and knowledge of students studying abroad in the whole of Europe. Initiated by the student associations of England, France, and the Netherlands, the inaugural meeting of the "General Association of Chinese Students in Europe" was held in London in August 1934. The charter was adopted, stipulating that an annual meeting should be held once during the summer vacation each year. The first annual meeting was held in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, in August 1935. This year, due to the convenience of the World Games, the second annual meeting was held in Germany. In addition to the representatives of England, Germany, and the Netherlands, students from Italy and Austria also officially sent representatives to attend. The remaining countries, such as France, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland, only had informal representatives present because they did not yet have student organizations. In addition, there were a total of 150 to 160 students from various countries participating. The third annual meeting is scheduled to be held in London in August next year. It is expected that all countries will have official representatives to attend, so that the organization of the General Association will become more sound.</p>
<p>Representatives of this Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The official representatives of this annual meeting from various countries are Chen Jiesheng and Huang Yuansheng from Germany, Zheng Kangqi and Zhu Guoxi from England, Chen Jianfeng and Chen Xiaxiang from the Netherlands, Shi Xiaoguang and Chen Jiabo from Italy, and Xu Zhongzhai and Huang Zhengjian from Austria. The staff of the General Association are as follows: President Chen Jiesheng, Vice President Huang Yuansheng, Secretariat Huang Can, Chen Tixiang, Lu Yisheng, Huang Yiqiu, Western Editorial Group Lin Qiusheng, Tao Pengfei, Zheng Kangqi, Liu Nianli, Chen Jianfeng, Chinese Editorial Group Wu Qiyun, Wei Yongcheng, Huang Yuansheng, Yu Ruiren, Wang Xueli, Zhang Jiayan, Liu Yinong, Zhu Guoxi, Sports Group Li Guochen, Zhu Zunyi, Pi Zongjing, General Affairs and Communication Jiang Hong, Sun Jian, Tao Pengfei, Entertainment Group Ju Boqiang, Lu Kemin.</p>

<h3>Double Coin Cup Summer Football Finale Champions China Aviation Runners-up Jiangnan</h3>
<p>The local Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory has always been enthusiastic about promoting sports. This summer, it specially launched the Double Coin Cup Summer Football Tournament. More than ten teams participated. None of the participating teams forfeited or withdrew. The weather this summer was hot, but they still persevered. The good sportsmanship can be said to have set a new record. The day before yesterday was the final. The teams that won the right to the final were China Aviation and Jiangnan Shipyard. The referee Shen Huichun blew the whistle at 8 am. The skills of both sides can be said to be comparable. The battle was full of highlights. Neither side scored in the first half. In the second half, the two sides held each other until the 20th minute, when China Aviation center Wu Guozhi scored a goal with a long shot. After that, Jiangnan tried its best to counterattack, hovering in front of the China Aviation goal many times. Unfortunately, due to inaccurate shooting, they did not score. As a result, China Aviation won 1-0 over Jiangnan. Afterwards, the Double Coin Cup consolation final was held. The teams that won the right to the final were Hengda and Overseas Chinese. Lu Shunde was the referee. Hengda fought bravely and opened the scoring first, but Overseas Chinese had a stronger strength. As a result, Overseas Chinese won 4-2 over Hengda.</p>
<h3>Western Police Football Team Actually Opposes Holding Games at the City Sports Field Yesterday's Letter to the League Committee Explains the Reasons</h3>
<p>Guoguang News Agency reported that the City Sports Field was specially built by the city government last year for the 6th National Games. The equipment is perfect and is the only large sports field in the Far East. Recently, the Donghua Football Club, because the environment is suitable, specially negotiated to borrow the field as their home field for the Western League games. The competition authorities have agreed. The trial match against Portugal the previous week and the official match against St. Francis last week were both held at the field. This week's match against the Western Police was held at Yiyuan because the Western Police was the home team. Unexpectedly, the Western Police team suddenly sent a letter to the League Committee the night before, expressing their opposition to holding future games at the City Sports Field. The reason is that the situation there is special, the transportation is inconvenient, and it is not suitable for football games. After receiving the letter, the committee has not yet convened a meeting to discuss it or replied to the team. According to the Western Police team, the annual rent for the second field of the Racecourse as their home field is 600 yuan. The rent for this year (1936-7) could not be paid due to economic difficulties. A meeting was held at the team's clubhouse on Fuzhou Road the night before (28th), but no concrete solution was reached.</p>

It was found that Mingde, Gengfeng, Taichang, Changfeng, Xincheng, and Jinkang unanimously sold out, while Tongji, Shenji, Dachang, Fukang, and Jinchang tried hard to buy in. As a result, each month rose by 2.8 to 3.6 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day, and October rose by 4.3 jiao. The market situation turned flat in the afternoon. Due to profit-taking, the market also reported unfavorable environment, and the selling trend became stronger, and the market fell step by step.

However, the big players Changhe and Run Kang took advantage of the rise to sell a lot, and the short positions increased, so that the table felt relaxed. The October contract returned to the 40 yuan mark, but the spot cotton situation is still high.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Also Rises Sharply</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened in the morning due to the continuous rise in British cotton for two days, the abandonment of the gold standard in France, the expected rise in overseas prices, and the sharp rise in the yarn market. Therefore, the market sentiment was enthusiastic and the short positions were active. Fortunately, yesterday the Indian cotton was flat and the Osaka cotton rose slightly by 1.2 jiao, so the upward trend was slightly slower. However, there were too many short positions in the October contract, so the recent trend turned upward. However, some people, due to unfavorable environment and smooth weather, tended to sell, and the distant months were tired.

The market was weaker in the afternoon, and the momentum was slightly weaker. Due to profit-taking by the long positions and the spot traders selling short, each month fell by 3 to 4 jiao compared with the closing price in the morning. The October contract broke the 40 yuan mark. It was found that Changhe sold 27,200 dan, Xincheng 7,400 dan, Hexing 2,600 dan, Fukang 200 dan, Yuda 8,700 dan, Gengfeng 9,900 dan, Changyu 4,100 dan, Wang Taixing 4,200 dan, Run Kang 6,000 dan, and Shengyuan 7,200 dan.

<h3>General Buying Sentiment at US Cotton Close</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with increases of 10 to 12 points per pound for all months. In the early morning, news from Liverpool was good, and interpretations of international finance favored buyers. There was heavy rain and cold weather in the western cotton regions. Foreign merchants bought in, and the market was very firm. Later, long positions were closed and cotton merchants sold short, resulting in a slight softening. New off-market participants were discovered. Although the rain in the west was sufficient to hinder cotton picking and damage the quality of cotton, buyers were still concerned. Before the close, private reports indicated damage to new cotton in Texas. Cloth sales were active, and the public bought in, pushing prices up again. The close was firm, with spot prices up 13 points per pound and futures up 9 to 14 points per pound. British cotton spot prices were up 6 points and futures up 4 points. Indian cotton European exporters absorbed the outflow from long positions, but later retreated due to profit-taking by long positions. Bengal rose by 1 rupee, Oomra rose by half a rupee, and White Broach rose by 0.75 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 28th).</p>

<h3>Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Rise Strongly</h3>

Various factories have raised their asking prices, with white goods rising by another 10 sen per piece and printed, dyed, and finished goods rising by another 15 to 45 sen per piece. Only bleached cloth is selling poorly due to the off-season. Hengfeng's Chenghua Splash Velvet, originally sold at 18.5 sen per yard, is now quoted at 19.5 sen. Guangzhong's Pine Crane Middle Pattern Velvet has increased from 18 sen last week to 19 sen and is now priced at 20 sen.

White goods, especially lightweight coarse cloth, are in the best position due to the current shortage on the market. Various purchasing agents continue to buy, and although market prices are high, the intention to purchase does not decrease. Cotton cloth sales at various factories and stores are booming, and business has more than doubled. Yesterday, due to border controls, shipments of goods for inland buyers were slightly reduced.

<h3>Securities: Unfavorable Environment; Financial Institutions Mostly Selling Government Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was still extremely weak. The Shanghai case was tense, and the market's sellers were particularly enthusiastic, especially those in the financial world. Their actions were particularly alarming, so although there were no huge advances on the surface, the underlying situation was gradually becoming tense.

<h3>Grain: Flour Delivery Does Not Wait Until Expiration</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for September flour futures, but there was no formal fulfillment on the exchange. Because the delivery was changed to public warehouses, the procedures were inconvenient and the costs were secretly increased. Therefore, both counterparties, such as customers, contacted the factory early if they wanted to withdraw the goods. Conversely, if the factory had a surplus that had not been settled, the brokers involved also peddled it to customers. Therefore, under the current situation, formal delivery is only carried out when absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3>Considerable Number of Coarse Grains Delivered</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grain trading saw a total of 26 carloads of wheat delivered throughout the day, with number 4 delivering 6 carloads, number 5 delivering 1 carload, number 6 delivering 2 carloads, number 10 delivering 2 carloads, number 12 delivering 3 carloads, number 16 delivering 1 carload, number 26 delivering 3 carloads, number 27 delivering 2 carloads, and number 38 delivering 6 carloads.

<h3>The Hakka Coarse Indica Rice and Cantonese Group Continue to be Actively Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for Hakka indica rice were robust in both arrival and sales, with an excellent market atmosphere. In particular, coarse indica rice was actively traded by the Cantonese group, and with limited inventory, the market continued to see a slight increase in prices. Yesterday, the Cantonese group purchased seven to eight thousand bags of coarse rice from various sources, with prices increasing by about one and a half jiao compared to the previous market. Other mills were actively traded by this street and the Shantou group, and market prices also showed a slight increase. The overall market opened with 6,850 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,350 bags of Hunan rice, 300 bags of Nanjing coarse rice, and 3,500 bags of Hubei coarse rice.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival Arrives, Rice Sales Stagnate</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrival from various groups was around 18 or 19, with a total of nearly 4,000 shi of goods. The West Street sales market remained sluggish due to the approaching festival. Therefore, new thin rice varieties such as Baige Yao and others, although there were more than 300 bags purchased by the Qingdao and Dalian groups, the resulting market prices decreased by a small one jiao to one and a half jiao. The price of thick new japonica rice also fell by one jiao. New sharp varieties like Du Yang and others continued to be scarce, and the market atmosphere remained stable. Broken and thick grains remained unchanged. The Qingdao group only purchased a few hundred bags of thin rice, and the market showed a trend of stability with a hint of softness. There was no supply of old rice that had turned into yuan. The supply of new rice that had turned into yuan exceeded demand, and prices fell by about one jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 shipments arrived from various groups downstream. The market sales of various goods, including broken japonica, mutated yuan, old thin rice, were dull. Western new japonica, new Yang Du埠 Hakka sharp rice were quite good. Market prices for broken japonica, mutated yuan, old thin rice, were sluggish by a few fen to nearly one jiao. New japonica, new Yang Du埠 Hakka sharp rice were tight by several fen. Eastern new japonica was stable, while Yao varieties were sluggish. Baige fell by a small one jiao. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and according to regulations, the rice industry in both the north and south markets will suspend measuring for one day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Domestic Silk Market Feels Even More Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market and the price of Chinese and Japanese raw silk both tended to soften. Except for Guangdong silk, each fell by one point. In exchange trading, the near-term was 12 and a half, and the far-term months remained unchanged. The market, however, was stalled due to many clean and soft silks, and there were no transactions in raw silk. There were no market quotes yesterday. Yokohama spot futures rose slightly by six to nine yuan, and were seen to be firm again in the afternoon. However, the local silk market felt quiet, and foreign firms also gradually ceased operations. Domestic users and hoarders also reduced their activity due to the uncertain situation. The total silk transaction for the whole day was only 56 bales. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and foreign merchants are also taking a customary holiday, so the domestic silk market may feel even more quiet.</p>
<p>Needle-Shaped Green Tea Sales Are Also Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market of foreign firms continued to be buoyant. Zhejiang Pingshui tea and Lüzhuang Zhenmei green tea were first promoted by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and other firms followed suit one after another. Even the Xiehe Foreign Firm for needle-shaped green tea also absorbed a large quantity. The total transaction volume of green tea in the city was more than 3,200 boxes, and the selling prices tended to be stable. As for the black tea market, the Shanghai market is about to end. It is heard that foreign firms are still planning to go to Henan and Hubei to continue their operations.</p>
<p>According to reports from tea warehouses, the green tea market has been affected by the devaluation of the French franc. Telegrams sent to Morocco a few days ago have not been responded to, so the market is very quiet. However, the Pingshui Zhenmei and Lüzhuang Xiumei that were previously discussed by various firms were officially traded yesterday. It is feared that the market will be difficult to develop for a while due to the French franc.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Musings</h3>
<p>— (Shufan)</p>
<p>White water and green reeds, a misty sorrow, not related to Qu Yuan lamenting on the riverbank. The sound of insects is clear and the merchant ships are steady, a row of cool lanterns moored for the passing of autumn!</p>
<p>Making a living by wandering the rivers and lakes, most fearful of the Mid-Autumn Festival. What can a traveler do tonight to dispel this feeling? A poem forms with disappointment, almost unbearable. Thirty years of life, considering its prime, is like the midpoint of autumn, the moon nearing its fullness. To dedicate oneself to society and country, it wouldn't be without some benefit. However, every step encounters obstacles, unable to reach the important path, leading to days and nights spent circling between wine cups and rice bowls, as if fearing falling behind. Year after year, the moon is bright, and I remain the same. Why must Huan Sima stroke the autumn willow to feel sentimental?</p>
<p>The azure sky shines with purity, but floating clouds invade, causing immediate alarm. No wonder Qu Yuan by the lakeside was alone and awake amidst the drunken masses. Therefore, the moon is intentionally bright, but the clouds are merciless. Applying this to people, wanting to move the vulgar with pure and impartial conduct, is it not difficult? What's gratifying is that the cool wind blows away the clouds, and clarity still remains. The darkness and changes do not harm the moon. This is why those with unique and independent spirits are bright and upright, enduring obstacles without regret? During this Mid-Autumn Festival, I suddenly contemplate my own position.</p>
<p>The moon is exceptionally bright during Mid-Autumn. This is why Mao Pijiang considered it the purest and most secluded time. Pijiang was merely afraid that the moonlight and autumn dew wouldn't last long. But for those who find inspiration in people and scenery, the feelings are different. Some families are joyful, some are sorrowful—this is the sentiment of children. Cool lanterns and flying dreams—how is the autumn frontier guard doing? This is what the valiant feel. "Pitying one's swaying shadow beneath the tree, who repaints the thousand-yuan heads of people?" This is the hero wanting to tread the battlefield but lacking a path. This year, tonight, who has the most autumn thoughts? Look at the waving clouds, how will each understand it!</p>
<h3>Going to the Moon</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>The moon is also one of the planets; therefore, it is a whole entity, not a fabricated illusion. Why is its light exceptionally bright during mid-autumn? Because the moon also has waxing and waning phases, and it meets the sun twice a month on the same meridian. The time between these meetings is called "new moon and full moon," approximately 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.87 seconds. Since the apparent diameter varies, and its orbit is elliptical, the moon appears to people as a hook or a half-wheel, gradually becoming like a bright mirror. Throughout the year, no moon is brighter than tonight's. Traditionally, people on this Mid-Autumn night compete to admire the beautiful moonlight. However, the so-called traveling to the moon palace and bowing to Chang'e is absurd and has no effect, which goes without saying. Therefore, I say that science is advancing rapidly, and humans will one day reach the moon, which is a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>Consider the earlier announcement by the American technician Kong Zhao of "traveling to Venus," and the later invention of rockets by Dr. Weiba Nahaofu, with the "news of corresponding with the moon." Recently, there was the British Dr. Lopison who "directly called Mars via radio." Judging by these examples, the moon is not too far from Earth. Compared to today's around-the-world travelers, the distance they travel exceeds the time and distance from Earth to the Moon. Then, will An He and others jointly tour the moon palace? Some say, "Impossible, no matter what! Once we reach the highest altitude, there is an obstacle, that is, the lack of breathable air, which will inevitably cause suffocation." Can one still ascend? "I say, don't worry," haven't you heard that chemists can create air? Along the way, when reaching the vacuum, clean air can be fully loaded and carried along. If so, why worry about not being able to visit the moon to conduct on-site experiments?</p>
<p>People today only know to worship and admire the moon. I say it's better to emulate the research of scientists, perhaps explore, perhaps travel, which is better than being confined to the tiny Earth, preventing people from moving forward. Moreover, speaking of launching rockets, it is said that "it is as convenient and direct as a mailbag. Like Vienna to New Zealand, it only takes 56 minutes. To reach the moon, the elapsed time, at most, is only one week, and the destination can be reached." Some say, "This is your dream." I say, please look at the aviation in the sky, what is it like now? Didn't the Western philosopher Vilin also say that flying machines were a fool's fantasy? But who would have thought that today it has become a world of aviation? Therefore, I believe that in the future, we will surely realize this statement, competing to go to the moon one day. Alas, those who burn incense and only know to look at the moon, wasting this fine night, are truly foolish.</p>

<h3>Autumn Insects, Autumn Moon</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>The swimming pool no longer has those fashionable men and women frolicking in the water; the cold drink shop has also taken down its sign, changing to a different business. On the pedestrian sidewalk, one no longer sees the poor sleeping in the open at night. All these scenes have hinted to people that autumn has arrived. Autumn is solemn and austere, autumn is lonely. Many poets and writers are sighing and chanting, creating many moving poems and prose. In fact, autumn never makes people lonely, nor does it harm a single hair on their heads. Saying that autumn is bitter and boring is truly complaining without illness. If you don't believe it, look at the many leisure classes and many bourgeois, who are greatly enjoying their autumn insects and savoring their autumn moon!</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many insects in autumn, such as crickets, katydids, and bell crickets. Whenever the night is deep and still, when dew drips and coldness invades, they chirp and sing loudly in the steps of the courtyard, under the bean trellises and melon frames, making many people feel unhappy. However, besides singing loudly, crickets also open their teeth and fight each other, making them practitioners of militarism, thus they are played with by people, becoming representatives of autumn insects. People raise them in earthenware pots, feeding them rice grains, seeming to cherish them to the utmost; but in fact, they are using their strength to win their own prize. Dressed in armor and displaying their power, they are nothing more than small puppets.</p>
<p>The autumn sky is high and clear, and the moon in the evening seems particularly bright. Because of the love of admiring the bright moon, the invention of mooncakes came about. Using the example of "Six Writings," this also belongs to the "associative compounds" category. The origin of mooncakes cannot be traced, but according to folk tales, at the end of the Yuan dynasty, the families of the Han people were monitored by Tartars - Mongols. At that time, Liu Bowen, holding racial revolutionary thoughts, bribed cake shops to insert paper slips inside the cakes, writing, "We Han people, quickly rise up and kill all the Tartars." Therefore, there is the story of eating mooncakes to kill Tartars, showing that mooncakes have been around for a long time. However, people nowadays are not as foolish as the ancients; and in this time of advocating good neighborliness, even if you have ten thousand grievances, you have to swallow them, so you chew the mooncakes without discerning whether the taste is sour, spicy, bitter, or sweet.</p>
<h3>The moon is exceptionally bright during Mid-Autumn</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Ten years ago, on a certain Mid-Autumn night, I was drifting in a certain city, living a desolate and lonely wandering life. In a small building, I was writing line after line on manuscript paper. The room was as quiet as death. Besides the sound of the pen tip scratching on the manuscript paper, one could not hear any other sound around.</p>
<p>Although it was a city, because I lived on the outskirts, the environment was very quiet. Especially at night, all sounds and activities gradually subsided. The flame of the electric lamp slowly faded, and I seemed to feel a bit tired, but I just couldn't sleep. The surrounding tranquility gave me a terrible threat, making me lack the courage to sit any longer. So I turned off the lamp and threw my body onto the bed.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn is a good festival in the year. Some refined people who enjoy admiring the moon, of course, have not missed this fine day and beautiful scenery. But I, "raising my head to look at the bright moon, lower my head and think of my hometown"; in such a full moon season, I am still drifting alone in a foreign land, just watching helplessly as this ungraspable time steals away from the shadows of my life. "On every festive occasion, I think even more of my relatives," and thinking of this, I can't help but sadly shed tears.</p>
<p>I suddenly got up from the bed, pushed open the window, and only saw a bright expanse of moonlight; however, a kind of sorrow had gently climbed into my consciousness, making me feel as if I had a belly of grievances to pour out to the bright moonlight.</p>
<p>On the writing desk, I laid out a sheet of manuscript paper, dipped the pen tip full of ink, and, with the help of the moonlight, wanted to write something; but, but what should I write about?</p>
<p>Suddenly, up to now, several more lonely Mid-Autumn nights have passed in the years of that wandering life. However, I drifted from this city to that city; over the years, I have only been busy with worldly affairs, and my hardworking life has not allowed me to stay properly in one place. Moreover, the famine of unemployment has pushed me onto this long-forgotten old road!</p>
<p>Autumn has quietly passed by half way. The Mid-Autumn Festival that people rejoice and dance for is coming. However, in this day when the country has reached the point of mountains and rivers being broken, and society is in the midst of a panic about livelihood, I can't help but be educated to be moved by the scene and feel sorrow at the moon, and once again "sadly shed tears"!</p>
<p>Now when I see mooncakes, I am reminded of our country; because our country now, in the eyes of the great powers, is simply a mooncake, and they can come to bite it or divide a piece at will, digging out the filling and peeling off the skin, wanting to eat it all up before stopping. The moon may be the same brightness every year, the same reunion, and those who enjoy admiring the moon will certainly not decrease, but what about our country's territory? Ah! Country, society, self... I really dare not think about them anymore.</p>
<p>"On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the moon is bright..." I will still sing a "back" to vent this pent-up anger in my heart!</p>
<h3>Examination of Elegant Names for the Moon</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, what is most worth appreciating is that the full moon in the long sky shines brightly throughout the nine continents, crystal clear and bright. One never tires of leaning on the railing to gaze at it hundreds of times. Here, ancient authors' beautiful verses praising the moon often use elegant characters. I have extracted some examples below to bring a smile to your face.</p>
<p>Jade Wheel (Yuan Ji's poem): The Yellow Road's jade wheel is majestic.</p>
<p>Toad and Hare (Ancient poem): Four or five toads and hares are waning.</p>
<p>Jade Toad (Liu Xiaochuo's poem): Half a jade toad is clustered in the branches.</p>
<p>Golden Hare (Jiang Zong's poem): The golden hare still hangs its soul, the bronze dragon is about to open its door.</p>
<p>Jade Plate (Li Bai's poem): When I was young, I didn't know the moon and called it a white jade plate.</p>
<p>Ice Wheel (Su Shi's poem): The ice wheel rises from the missing snow peak.</p>
<p>Cassia Soul (Wang Wei's poem): The cassia soul is just born, and the autumn dew is slight.</p>
<p>Silver Hare (Emperor Yang of Sui's poem): Clear dew coldly invades the silver hare's shadow. (Qiulang)</p>
<h3>Mooncake Song</h3>
<p>— (Ni Gaofeng)</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon's shape is round, shining on the human world with exceptional freshness, the mooncake is as round as the moon. Its quality is beautiful and its color is gorgeous, every household buys them, competing to be first. In this vast world, amidst the sea of karma, the rise and fall of careers are like floating clouds. It's best to enjoy today's wine and not worry about the transformations of the world. Hoping only to spend time in peace and joy, wishing for this reunion moon to be round every day, and for the fresh and beautiful flowers to be gorgeous every day, even neglecting the pitiful farmers' sweat that drips into the soil. Celebrating the autumn scenery while lamenting the lack of money, staring blankly at the beautiful moon in the sky, just craving the mooncake in front of you, but merely quenching thirst with plums. Hearing the sounds of moon appreciation from the east neighbor, that group's voices are noisy and bustling, and also hearing the sounds of moon appreciation from the west neighbor, holding wine glasses and filled with joy. How different is prosperity from decay, separated like heaven and earth. If we talk about the people in the city eating mooncakes and celebrating reunion, it is even more sincere than the villagers, with fine wine and delicious dishes and lavish feasts, the cakes are as big as basins and filled with all kinds of fruits, cutting and eating them with smiling faces, inviting relatives and friends to dine together, or narrating family reunion, shouting loudly, happy and joyful, the Mid-Autumn Festival is truly not in vain. Moreover, there are those low-ranking officials and subordinates, taking advantage of this time, to spend two hundred silver dollars, buying a big mooncake to send to the powerful and influential top officials, whether it is a yellow box or not, bribes and bribery are irrelevant, hoping everyone understands, from then on the position is solid and firm, maintaining it year after year, the principle of dealing with the world is actually like this, I want to be silent, truly pitiful, if you don't act like this and deal carefully, it is difficult to guarantee that the position will not change, the moon shape is round, the mooncake shape is the same as the bright moon, it turns out it is such a fate.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous words.</p>
<h3>New Words on Mid-Autumn</h3>
<p>— Aimei</p>
<p>Last year's Mid-Autumn, I wrote trivial words; in a flash, the festival is approaching again. The full tree of osmanthus fragrance, is still strong, a sky of moonlight, as bright as silk; I have abandoned the pen to sell articles, and I am still the same as before. What is slightly different is that before I lived in the countryside, now I am in Shanghai. "Wandering for thousands of miles has become a long-term traveler, and another year easily brings the autumn wind;" reciting Lu You's poem, how can one not feel moved? "Alone in a foreign land as a stranger, on every festive occasion, I think even more of my relatives;" chanting Wang Wei's line, one is even more melancholy!</p>
<p>I have always criticized the idea of spending holidays as meaningless, but I particularly love the Mid-Autumn Festival; this is because I love the moon, and the Mid-Autumn Festival is precisely in the middle of the autumn season, the sky is high and the air is clear, the clouds are light and the wind is clear, making it the most suitable time for admiring the moon, and the moon is indeed more lovely than at other times! If the Moon Sister knows, she will consider me an understanding friend.</p>
<p>The title of Moon Sister, some people think it is based on the story of Chang'e, but in fact it is not; according to the Spring and Autumn Chronicles of Spiritual Omens, "The ruler of men, fathers heaven, mothers earth, brothers sun, sisters moon," its source is probably from this. Especially because the two words "Moon Sister" are fragrant and beautiful beyond compare, so they are most widely spread among the population.</p>
<p>Shen Zi said, "The moon is like a silver pill, receiving the sun's light;" it can be seen that the idea has been around since ancient times, due to the words of Western scientists; according to my research, today's science and our old books often match, this is just one example.</p>
<p>Ancient customs: the day before Mid-Autumn, people make "eye-brighteners" with brocade colors, and give them to each other as gifts; this is probably due to the story of Deng Shao. The Continued Harmonious Records of Qi states, "Shao, on the first day of the eighth month, entered Mount Hua and saw a child holding five-colored ropes, receiving dew on cypress leaves; Shao asked: What is this for? The child replied: Master Chisong takes it to brighten his eyes." Later generations imitate this and it became a custom. There are also those who do it on the first day of the month. The Record of Telling about Conquests says, "On the first day of the eighth month, make five bright ropes, take the dew from the tops of a hundred grasses to wash the eyes, so that the eyes will be bright." Also, they use vermilion water to dot the heads and foreheads of children, called "heavenly branding," to ward off diseases; also on the day before Mid-Autumn, all seen in the Seasonal Records of Jingchu.</p>
<p>According to the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, "In the country of Polozhe, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, they perform statues and tightrope walking for entertainment;" the strange people and customs can be a joke. However, where exactly this country of Polozhe is, I have not been able to examine; is it perhaps a utopia? It also says, "During the Changqing era, someone playing with the moon on the fifteenth night of the eighth month, the light belonged to the forest, the middle was like a bolt of cloth, and looking for it, they saw a golden-backed toad: the matter is also strange and absurd. I mean, perhaps it is still just a rural tale of Qi."</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn moon has a different name, called the "Upright First Month." Therefore, Han Changli's poem says, "The Upright First Month of the three autumns, comes out of the eastern sea tonight." I say, its name is certainly not bad, but it feels somewhat stuffy, and the wording makes me feel like it is too upright. A laugh!</p>
<p>The legend of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty and Master Shen, the Taoist Hongdu guest, touring the Guanghan Palace on Mid-Autumn night is quite popular; the Rainbow Feather Robe Dance composed for it was not passed down to the world, and those who speak of it regret it. And they do not know that in ancient Yuefu music, there was the Song of a Widow, probably composed by the Han people when there was no moon during Mid-Autumn; Li He's Eighth Month Music poem has the line: "The widowed concubine resents the long night," which refers to this. It was also lost, truly regrettable.</p>
<p>"When will the bright moon be there? I hold my wine to ask the blue sky. I don't know what year it is tonight in the palaces in the sky? I want to ride the wind to return, but I fear the high palaces in the jade towers cannot withstand the cold. I rise to dance with my clear shadow, how is it like being in the human world? Turning to the red pavilion, lowering to the patterned door, shining on those who cannot sleep. There should be no resentment, why is it round only at the time of parting? People have sorrow, joy, separation, and reunion, the moon has gloom, brightness, fullness, and wane, such things are difficult to perfect since ancient times. I only wish people will be long-lived, and share the beauty of the moon from a thousand miles away." This is the Su Dongpo Water Melody Prelude that is widely recited in the literary world. According to Dongpo, Zhu Jiayou was a Jinshi scholar, but during the reign of Emperor Shenzong, his opinions clashed with Wang Anshi, and he was demoted to Huangzhou. On the Mid-Autumn of the Bingchen year, he drank happily until dawn, and thus filled in this poem. At that time, it spread throughout the capital, and the eunuch recorded this and presented it to the emperor. Emperor Shenzong read until "but I fear the high palaces in the jade towers cannot withstand the cold," and said: Su Shi still loves the ruler, and then ordered him to be transferred to Ruzhou. This is also an old fact of Mid-Autumn that one should know.</p>
<p>The most common of Mid-Autumn foods is the mooncake, and those who eat cake are rare, but there was such a custom in the past; the Yuan Family Side Courtyard Record says, "On the night of Mid-Autumn, Emperor Wuzong and the concubines ate the moonflower cake." The cake is called moonflower, how elegant! Moreover, the cake is mostly made of glutinous rice flour, and if made properly, its taste is even more delicious than mooncakes; from now on, on Mid-Autumn, it may be worthwhile to repeat the story of Emperor Wuzong, to promote eating it.</p>
<p>Other seasonal foods, such as water chestnuts, lotus roots, chestnuts, persimmons, apples, lilies, pomegranates, taro, etc. are all good. There is also a kind of lotus root cake, made by mashing fresh lotus root, mixing it with rice flour, taking osmanthus-flavored oil to make a cake, making it into a cake shape, and frying it in oil. It is delicious and moist, and I like it most; unfortunately, I am now a guest, and cannot get to eat it; thinking of this makes me even more homesick.</p>

<h3>It's Mid-Autumn Again</h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>Another year easily passes, it's Mid-Autumn again.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn is an important event in commerce. Personnel changes mostly happen on this day. Compared to the end of the year, its importance is not much less. In this era when the wave of economic recession is relentlessly striking, and China's national industry is under the heavy pressure of foreign capital, we really dare not speculate on how many factories and shops will quietly declare liquidation under this "festival checkpoint", and how many personnel will lose their jobs due to retrenchment? And this year, because of the rampant smuggling, we dare not imagine what the situation will be even after passing Mid-Autumn.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn is also the season that most easily stirs up the sorrows of travelers. The ancient poet's line "The moon is curved, shining on the nine provinces, some families happy, some families sorrowful" has already spoken for us the feelings of travelers. This line, which was recited for a time and known to every household, was written by ancient people. Now, we witness the changing colors of the mountains and rivers (it's already been five years!), and the national crisis is deepening day by day, our feelings are certainly not limited to this!</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn moon is the brightest moon of the year, and we cannot help but be moved when we look at it. We are still the people hiding in this corner of Shanghai, where we are making merry and celebrating peace. Although we have already seen the brutal face of the enemy, and the pain of the resulting industrial and commercial decline, compared to those who live under the iron heel, or who have fled from under the iron heel, the "homeless" people, we have a little less "personal" pain. However, we are already overwhelmed by the taste of "the country is broken, but the mountains and rivers remain"; if the "homeless" people who are "drifting abroad" and the people struggling under the iron heel see this bright moonlight, thinking of the Changbai Mountains, and "the world's first pass" where "the scenery is still the same", what kind of grief will they have?</p>
<p>Shanghai is superficially a world of making merry and celebrating peace, but if we tear off its extravagant coat and look at the essence inside, we really don't have the courage to be optimistic; these few days, especially because of the sudden outbreak of the unfortunate incident on Haining Road, the situation has become very tense, and people are panicked, with a great momentum of not being able to last even a day, making us dare not imagine what kind of face this Shanghai, drunk on money, will become?</p>

<h3>Festival</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>The bill collecting clerk, like an old horse that has unloaded a heavy load, stepped into the shop, put his black leather briefcase on the counter, and collapsed into the armchair, just wiping the sweat from his brow with his handkerchief. Seeing a cup of cold tea on the counter, he grabbed it and gulped it down his throat before opening his mouth to speak:</p>
<p>"Each festival is worse than the last! Out of eight hundred-odd debts, I only collected two hundred-odd dollars!"</p>
<p>He opened his briefcase, counted the bills, and handed them to the manager, along with a stack of invoices for outstanding debts.</p>
<p>The manager seemed to be bewitched. Since the clerk left to collect debts after dinner, he had used the abacus several times. Pharmacies were originally the most profitable businesses, buying goods by the catty and selling them by the fen and qian; of course, one couldn't keep all the profits to oneself by making loans. Usually, offering an 80% or 90% discount, a profit of 40% was still guaranteed. Although the year was economically depressed, people still got sick. From the Dragon Boat Festival to Mid-Autumn, eight hundred-odd debts could be considered good business. But when the manager put the abacus to use, his eyeballs seemed stuck on the beads, almost unable to move. Even if all eight hundred-odd debts were collected with an 80% or 90% discount, it would only be enough to recoup his original capital. The interest was all spent on advertising and all kinds of giveaways.</p>
<p>"Making a sale is so difficult these days!" The manager couldn't help scratching his scalp with his long fingernails, pacing back and forth in the small space in front of the loan counter.</p>
<p>Across the street, a sugar and vegetable store had just put up a colorful archway, hiring several wind and percussion musicians to make a racket all morning. The sunlight shone on the center of the street, and the electric lights spelling out "Twelfth Anniversary" were already lit. When the manager looked up, his eyes felt as if they were being pricked by needles.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" His resentment found a place to vent. "Everything's on sale year-round, is it really the twelfth anniversary? Don't tell me all these shameless... What kind of great sale does a pharmacy have? Poor people shouldn't get sick. If they can afford to be sick, are they afraid of losing their lives? Doctors, pharmacies, this is a tougher business than the coffin shop! Shameless, they come up with these big sales with reduced prices, printing a full page of advertisements, putting up electric light archways, giving away tiger bone and papaya wine, so you also reduce prices, I also reduce prices, and Yanshou Hall, a centuries-old shop, fell down in one festival..."</p>
<p>Thinking about Yanshou Hall falling down, the manager saw countless gold flies buzzing in front of his eyes. But he barely managed to calm himself and sat down again to use the abacus. He made many calculations. For example, if he could collect six hundred dollars out of eight hundred-odd debts, he could barely get through Mid-Autumn. The end of the year was the most profitable time of year. Sick people needed medicine, and healthy people needed tonics. The Wang residence, the Li residence, ginseng and silver ear fungus, each order was three hundred or five hundred dollars. As long as he could hold onto these few residences, was he still afraid of falling down?</p>
<p>A glimmer of hope finally appeared before the manager's eyes. He waited for the bill collecting clerk to bring back hope, flipping through the account books and puffing on his pipe, occasionally casting a disdainful glance at the colorful archway across the street to show his defiance.</p>
<p>When the bill collecting clerk returned, the shop had already had dinner. The manager was just using his goose feather tube to pick the rice grains left in his teeth. He often complained about his toothache and often said that when he got a bonus, he would have the dentist fix his whole mouth because taking care of one's body was important.</p>
<p>Now the clerk was sitting in the armchair across from him, with two hundred-odd dollars in bills in front of him. His whole body felt electrified. He slowly reached out to grab that stack of invoices, the first one being from the Li residence. This big customer's outstanding bill was two hundred and forty-eight dollars.</p>
<p>"What!" He widened his eyes at the clerk. "You didn't collect anything from the Li residence either?"</p>
<p>The clerk nodded, but the manager's eyes didn't leave his face, and he spoke in the smallest voice.</p>
<p>"Their whole family has gone to Qingdao. The old nanny who often came with Mrs. Li told me that Master Li lost over two million in the stock exchange, and they might have to sell their house."</p>
<p>The manager sat down. His hands trembled as he flipped through the invoices, one by one. The gold flies buzzed in front of his eyes again in droves, gradually making it hard to see the numbers on the invoices. But those numbers had already taken root in his stomach—over eight hundred dollars!</p>
<h3>After the Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>The old woman, carrying a copper kettle, walked in. As soon as she entered, she turned her face to the Second Master and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu said Zhenping is back. Please, Second Master, go have a look at the grain."</p>
<p>The Second Master grunted, threw the cigarette butt from the corner of his mouth into the spittoon, and walked towards the courtyard.</p>
<p>The row of Rouge Red in the courtyard had been blown bare by the autumn wind, the yellow-green leaves mixed with pale red petals covered the muddy ground in the row, and many black seed pods of jasmine were blown by the wind, rolling on the brick ground. The Second Master walked into the accounting room, wiped the corner of his mouth with a handkerchief, and the two middle-aged men beside the table stood up.</p>
<p>The Second Master sat in the chair of honor by the window, looking at Zhenping standing at the corner of the table opposite him, and said:</p>
<p>"Haven't you eaten?"</p>
<p>"No hurry, Second Master, take a look at this." This middle-aged man was very satisfying to the Shu family. He himself ran a small general store on the south street of this town, letting his brother take care of it. But he bought grain for the Second Master at various docks, lending money with a reliable guarantor. He was quite astute in every way and had a bit of eloquence. At this time, he pushed the three paper packages on the table over and pointed to the first package:</p>
<p>"This 'Big Snake Eye' (red-hatted sorghum with large grains) is really good, Second Master, take a bite. It's 'ice areca nut mouth' (meaning crisp and dry). We collected 150 dan of it. That's old dou. Combined with our new dou (measuring unit) here, it's 340 with a little change."</p>
<p>"What price?"</p>
<p>"This one is five dollars and eighty cents." He pushed the first package next to the abacus, then pulled the second package over: "This one is a bit worse in quality, three dollars and twenty cents. We didn't collect much of this. Overall, the sorghum, no matter the quality, averages out to four dollars and ten cents per dan, including the porterage and miscellaneous expenses. Right now, the market price here is...?"</p>
<p>The accountant, Mr. Hu, who had been silent for a long time and had retreated to sit by the table, was listening honestly. He calculated that the purchased grain was just over four dollars per dan. There was little rice collected from the market, but a lot of cotton could be sold... Suddenly, he saw his assistant looking at him questioningly, so he anxiously said:</p>
<p>"The high price is four dollars and sixty or seventy cents."</p>
<p>Then the Second Master's eyes also turned to look at him, and he smartly sat up straight.</p>
<p>The man who had been reporting grain prices for a long time walked over and poured two cups of tea from the kettle on the table, very respectfully placing one bowl in front of the master.</p>
<p>"Second Master, won't you have a drink?"</p>
<p>The Second Master watched him drink several bowls of tea in a row, then opened the third paper package on the table himself. Inside was a large handful of plump wheat kernels.</p>
<p>"What's the price of this wheat?"</p>
<p>"Wheat is really scarce," he shouted loudly, spattering saliva onto the table. The master glared at him, and he withdrew his hand, which he had been waving in the air: "We only bought fifty-six dan. It was agreed to be seventy-eight cents, but who knew the Hongchang family on West Street also went to buy it! They offered eighty-two cents, and they snatched seventy dan away. I immediately lost my temper. How can you do business like that? We're almost 'over the dou' (meaning making a loss), and the people in the dou bureau said nice things and asked us to be understanding..."</p>
<p>The Second Master was a little displeased. He knew that local wheat sold for ninety-seven or ninety-eight cents. The Cold Dew solar term had already passed, and not a drop of rain had fallen. No one could sow wheat, so if he could hoard three or four hundred dan, he would make a fortune next spring. How could he let someone else take seventy dan with a higher price! So he said:</p>

<p>All branches in Shanghai can send registered express airmail and handle remittances, savings, and other services.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>"Didn't you receive my letter?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Sigh," he patted his thigh regretfully, "Eighty-two cents is still worth it!"</p>
<p>The man, because he had talked for so long, was very excited and his face was red. After being told this by the master, he knew that the local wheat had risen again, and he felt that the master was a little unhappy. So he took out the "flower bill" for buying grain from his waist, pointed and told the master how much grain each family had and how much money they got. Finally, he said:</p>
<p>"The rules of the dou bureau are: pay when the grain arrives!"</p>
<p>The Second Master nodded and, as if doting on a child, told him to go to the kitchen to get something to eat. The man then quietly slipped out of the room.</p>
<p>At this time, there was a banging sound in the courtyard. Little Qiu and Lao Chun were carrying kerosene into the east wing. The Second Master watched through the window as they quickly finished arranging the barrels, then said to the accountant:</p>
<p>"Go tell Bu Lao San that the forty-three dollars for kerosene will be added to the rent."</p>
<p>The accountant grunted in agreement and walked into the courtyard. Little Qiu was unlocking the door there. Seeing the accountant come out, he jumped down the steps and shouted:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hu, write down forty-five dollars for Bu Lao San's kerosene."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu was caught off guard by the child's sharp shout, and his ears rang slightly. He pressed his ear with a finger and said:</p>
<p>"The master said forty-three."</p>
<p>"It's gone up again. The supply isn't coming down from above. Tomorrow a barrel will sell for five dollars."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu turned his head and looked at the master sticking his head out of the glass window, as if to say: What should we do?</p>
<p>The Second Master waved his hand in the room, saying in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Forty-five it is. Tell him we'll add it to the rent!"</p>
<p>Mr. Hu coughed and shrugged his shoulders, quickly walking out of the courtyard.</p>

<p>Opening: "Mid-Autumn Moon Difficult"</p>
<p>Year after year, seasons come and go. The sun and moon rush by like flowing water. This year's autumn moon is still present. This year, the eighth month has arrived again. Thinking of today, the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth of the month, I only see a round bright moon shining on tall buildings. The clouds are faint, and the full moon adds charm. I can't help but imitate Emperor Ming and ascend to the moon. Oh, moon, I see that today your face is different from before. I see that your desolate color is all gone. I see that your beautiful and full splendor seems to be smiling. I see that it is all because every family is celebrating the moon without end. I see that although you are clear and bright like a mirror. I see that moonlight cannot solve people's sorrows. Do you know, some families happily admire the moon together. Some families sadly face the moon in loneliness. Some families see the moon with sad faces. Some families love the moon and go out to enjoy it. Some are husbands and wives spending their honeymoon together. Some are living in the East and West, each plotting their own course. Some are gathering under the moon to feast together. Some are rushing about everywhere, running around all their lives. Some are happily and freely inviting the full moon. Some are wandering about, unable to be free. Some are like the Mid-Autumn moon. Some are like the crescent moon hook. I think that the full moon will inevitably wane. Even the crescent moon is still afraid of being imprisoned by clouds. How can mortals compare to the great void of the moon? In the end, the moon in the mirror is all illusory. The moon wanes but has a day to be full again. How can a person who dies return like the moon? The moon wanes and waxes year after year. How can a human life be as long as the moon's? How can one share eternity with the moon?</p>

<p>In the fourth month of the Daguan era, drunk in the spring day, everywhere in the peony garden are fresh flowers. The season belongs to Qinghe, and the flowers are still good. It is Elder Brother's birthday, and a flower banquet is set up. Red fragrance and splendor, a magnificent banquet is opened. People come under the flowers, full of joy. Drumming urges the flowers and wine is drunk. Borrowing flowers, they present them to Buddha and compose poems in pairs. A beautiful woman, after the banquet, vaguely searches for the flower path... like a flower fairy. The flowers seem to understand human intentions and add charm frequently... drunk... leaning against the flowers... it seems as if the flowers have feelings... in a drunken state... flowers... like cotton, don't... approaching... flower bottom, flower path, entering and picking up... The flower face is good, the drunken state is upside down. People... flowers... both beautiful. Flowers facing drunk people... fading. People are beautiful because of the flowers, making them more enchanting. Bees and butterflies playing with flowers, don't... a... waist, the flowers also pity. Flowers... birds chirping, startling dreams... Fragrant sisters... arriving at the flowers... Peach blossom face, flushing, difficult to... Gently arranging the flowers... holding hands and circling. Red buildings, flowers, and moon are eternally graceful.</p>

<p>Opening: "Mid-Autumn"</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn moon in August is round and bright. The beautiful colors fill the sky... silver lamps. The five lakes and four seas... continents shine. Big and small, hundreds of families want to invite the Moon Palace. They are buying incense, and ascending high. Red candles burn high, pleasing the happy god. Offering three fruits. Worshipping the moon's shadow, and... Pond lotus roots, persimmons, white fruits, and snacks. Good hometown chestnuts, taro, and soybeans are distributed on both sides. Guangdong mooncakes have new designs. Ham... egg, and sweet bean paste are exquisite. The large incense stand, flags, and umbrellas have a dragon gate. On the flag pole, the god of literature stands in the five clouds. The small decorations, white jade, and jadeite are dazzling. Carving is the work of a skillful scholar and flute player. They say, celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival with clear eyes and bright moon. Coming and going, I am... slender and graceful, sisters and daughters. Wearing fashionable autumn clothes, new and trendy. The high-heeled leather shoes on their feet make a clicking sound. Winter Solstice arrives. The New Year is near. Spring passes. At the beginning of summer, they eat cherries, plums, and fermented glutinous rice cakes. In an instant, next year's Mid-Autumn Festival will arrive again. Year after year, like a wheel. Time flies, urging people to grow old. Youthful beauty transforms into white-haired people.</p>

<h3>Grand Shanghai Grand Theater Presents the Colorful Blockbuster "Buccaneer in Silk"</h3>
<p>The film industry's first three-color, stereoscopic, colorful song and dance blockbuster, "Buccaneer in Silk," will be presented at the Grand Shanghai Grand Theater starting today. The film stars Corinne Collins and Stephen "The Gay Deception" Dunne, with support from the master of humor, Frank Morgan. The film features five or six song and dance scenes, with the Spanish castanet dance and the Carabe dance being the most exciting. The actors' costumes are extremely beautiful and moving. Coupled with the rendering of colors, it is even more radiant, dazzling, and unmatched. It is rumored that RKO spent nearly three million gold dollars to produce the film.</p>
<h3>"Anthony Adverse" Opens Today</h3>
<p>Background Spanning Five Continents, Over Four Hundred Scenes</p>
<p>Warner Brothers, after spending more than two years and exerting all its efforts to produce "Anthony Adverse," is now showing it in advance at the Grand Theater starting today (Wednesday). The completion of this literary film has shocked the entire Hollywood film industry, and they all believe that this is the biggest harvest of the film industry this year. In terms of achievements in film art, it is more remarkable than "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and other films.</p>
<p>The film tells the story of a girl, Maria, who is forced by a snobbish father to marry the old and declining Marquis Don Luis, and has a physical relationship with her old lover, the Irish military officer Moore. She becomes pregnant and they agree to elope to Canada. Unfortunately, Don discovers them, and in a sword fight, Moore dies by the sword. After Maria gives birth, she also dies miserably. Don sends the child to a monastery. It happens to be the feast day of St. Anthony, so the priest names him Anthony. When Anthony is - years old, he is sent to Bonafé (Maria's father) to study. Bonafé, through special hidden knowledge, learns that he is his grandson, and cherishes him to the fullest, keeping it a secret. This charmer, from childhood to adulthood, has fallen in love with three women. One of them, Angela, also becomes pregnant. Later, she joins the Teatro de la República opera troupe and her reputation grows daily. Later, she even becomes a favorite captive of Napoleon. Until Anthony returns from Africa and wants to rekindle their old love, he suddenly discovers their illegitimate child. The King Napoleon, knowing the truth, sends Anthony as an envoy to the United States. The whole film ends with Anthony taking the third generation of little Anthony, echoing the title of the film, as a sail vaguely disappears into the distance.</p>
<p>When the film was about to start shooting, the adaptation of the script and the selection of actors had already taken a lot of time and deliberation. And because the area in the story includes five continents, and the time spans twenty-five years, they must be carefully researched and cannot be fabricated. The nationality, personality, and age of each character in the book must be clearly analyzed. As a result, after two years, ninety-eight important actors were selected, and four hundred scenes were built. Then the director, Mervyn LeRoy, began to spend months of effort to introduce this famous novel "Anthony Adverse," which has three million readers, to the screen. This is indeed an unparalleled glory in the film industry.</p>
