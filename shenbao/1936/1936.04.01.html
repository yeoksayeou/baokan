<p>柏林　頃據官方宣佈、政府對於羅卡諾四國協定所提出之對案、已由希特勒元首親信里本特洛浦、於本日午後、携往倫敦（卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒之專使里賓特洛浦將軍今日午後携德國對英法此意四國備忘錄之覆文、由此乘飛機前往倫敦、據官塲宣稱、里氏將於今晚以覆文送致英政府、覆文原擬於星期一日可以完成、其延遲之原因、乃由籌商可由英法兩國同予接受之建議、頗感困難、及由此决德國總選舉之結果、已使希特勒大增勢力之故、或謂其另一原因、由於德政府願充分考慮法外長佛蘭亭昨日所發表之選舉演說、卽請希特勒答覆與歐洲大局有關之若干問題、並願充分考慮英法參謀長談話之建議云、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德國政府對於羅卡諾四國協定草案、所當提出之對案、業已决定由該國元首希特勒親信里本特洛浦携來此間、一般人預料本日深夜當可遞到、事前外務部方面、業已特別佈置、俾外相艾登能立卽獲悉其內容、若干觀察家解釋德國政府遲遲送出對案之理由、以爲此舉足以表示該國有意採取比較緩和之態度、並謂里本特洛浦日前與外相艾登晤談之後、原擬向德國政府建議、對於萊茵河區域一項問題、略作妥協表示、若干人士因而希望里本特洛浦今晚所携來之對案中、能包含此項妥協表示云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德國政府對於羅卡諾四國協定草案、定於本日提出對案、一般人均甚關切、以爲此項對案、若多可取之處、則現行局勢、自必完全改觀、屆時羅卡諾協定各簽字國、卽英法比意四國、對於此項對案、是吾認爲滿意、自當一致加以决定、但是吾經由外交途徑、交換意見、抑或在比京舉行會議、猶未可知云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法比參謀部　仍當進行接洽　謂可促進對德談判</h3>
<p>倫敦　英國政府依照羅卡諾會議三月十九日所成立之協定草案、當以函件送致法比兩國、聲明保障各該國之安全、並由英法比三國參謀部、進行談話、締結軍事協定、加以實行、關於此層、政界人士頃宣稱、英國政府現準備向法國送出此項函件、但希望法國政府首先提供保證、聲明三國參謀部軍事協定、當與法比兩國所已締結之軍事協定、作同樣解釋、法國若果接受此項建議、則英國政府當在致法國政府函中、將法比兩國軍事協定所載之特別條欵、一併列入、此項條欵有云、「此項軍事協定、並不包含政治義務、關係各國國防組織、亦不因此而接受何項義務」、英國政府此舉、乃表示不欲採取何項準備辦法、例如實施强迫兵役制之類、（按英國夙用募兵制）並欲保留政治上之自由、一般人預料法國政府對於英國此項要求、當可在本日之內、提出復文、俾英國內閣明日開會時、得以採取最後决定云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英法比三國參謀部依據羅卡諾協定所當進行之談話、當於何日開始、英國內閣明日舉行例會時、自可加以决定、至德國政府對於羅卡諾協定所可提出之對案、內容如何、在所不計、此項談話、仍當開始進行、一般人以爲此項談話、可使法國獲得安全之感、因而獲得羅卡諾公的各關係國未來之談判所必需之信任心云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日盛傳英內閣閣員間、關於四國草案附件中所規定之英法比軍事談話、意見極不一致、同時上下院有多數議員、接得各界人士之意見書極多、均表示反對各國參謀本部人員會談之事、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　事業報外交記者塔布衣夫人、頃發表一文云、駐英大使戈爾平、昨日午後、曾與英國外相艾登、曁决官在西泰、同就未來羅卡諾會議問題、有所磋商、歷時頗久、聞戈爾平大使常時會向艾登聲明、法國願望此項會議、須於耶蘇復活節前、在比京白魯塞爾城舉行、惟英國以爲、須將德國所當提出之對案、作縝密研究之後、始可决定開會日期、大抵此際英國用意、僅在竭力延宕時日、俾各主要關係國輿論、得以鎭定之態度觀察時局、「蓋英國希望德國或能在數星期之內、參加關係各國之未來談判也云」、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　關於羅卡諾會議協定草案，德國政府所擬提出之對案、不日當由羅卡諾公的四簽字國（卽英法比意四國）在比京白魯塞爾城開會、加以研究、茲悉屆時意國亦將派員參加、惟據半官式人士聲稱、意國對於未來羅卡諾會議、仍將採取保留態度、與倫敦會議時無異、質言之、卽制裁辦法、一日繼續實施、則意國卽一日保持自由行動是也、關於參加英法比三國參謀部談話一節、意國態度、此際尚未决定、當俟白魯塞爾會議結束之後、始可確定云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據本社訪員所知、德國明日所當提出之對案、內容是吾足使關係各國感覺滿意、外務部至今尚未接得駐德大使費潑斯爵士之報吿、又德國代表里本特洛浦。是吾奉命重返倫敦祖任折衝、亦尚不可知、大抵德國對案、若可認爲滿意、則英德兩國參謀部談話、或將與英法比三國參謀部間談話、同時舉行、艾登外相、現定於明日延見比國大使馬希安、就三國參謀部談話問題、有所洽商云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法德報紙互詆　德國選舉謂有黑幕</h3>
<p>柏林　此間半官界人士對於法國外交部長佛蘭亭在星期日所發表之演說、莫不表示憤懣、認其爲「侮辱德國、並無建設性質之建議、」因而對於德國外交當局所作之努力、毫無裨益、柏林交易所報載稱、德國重在萊茵河區域建造防禦工事、係以鈸靜出之、旣非匆遽行事、亦未加以隱飾、「此舉可爲樹立眞實和平之先聲、祗須法國誠意期望和平、並了然於招致和平之道、决非以强凌弱之手段所能濟事、則和平庶幾有豸矣、德國政府茲當於明日提出具體建議、俾就佛蘭亭所提各項問題、公開而又盡量加以答復」云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　名記老夏茀、頃在柏林日報上發表一文、對於法國佛蘭亭外長、昨日所發表演說、加以評論、略謂「德國外交當局、聞此演說之後、其所負之職責、當未必易於措手也」、述及佛蘭亭向德國所提各項問題、卽德國對於米美爾但澤及奧國究抱何種意向一層、夏茀謂、「國聯會所有會員國、若均如法國之所爲、而代他國提出問題、則歐洲局勢、將伊於胡底乎、總之、任何保證、、其性質足以使人認爲吾人遵守條的不如他國者、均非吾人所願提供也」云云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　外傳昨日衆議院舉行改選時、有多數空白選票、亦經作爲贊成希特勒之票、此說關係方面并未加以吾認、按此决投票、侯選人名單、僅有國社黨所提出之一種、顯已與魏馬憲法所規定之各黨競選制度不符、又此决選票、下端留有空白圓圈、贊成希特勒元首者、當在圈中劃一十字、彼表示反對者原應書一「吾」字、惟一留筆蹟、恐爲人所認出、致干罪譴、苟欲撕毀選票、則又監視嚴密、（票匭與大隊選民、及國社黨軍所在之室、僅隔一幕、）未易實行、於是反對者、僅有不劃十字、而投白票之一法矣、觀於昨晚選舉結果宣布方式、前後不同、（至昨晚九時爲止、選票原分爲廢票與有效票、嗣後僅分爲贊成與反對票兩種、）可知空白選票數額、當遠較官方預期者爲多也（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>瑞士熊城　聯邦行政院、頃舉行會議、當由陸軍部長閔傑、說明國際時局隍阢不安、瑞士邊界防務、必須予以充實、所需經費、的爲二三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇瑞士法郎、當分爲數年撥付、或將發行公債、以資籌措云、行政院嗣又决定建造軍用飛機四十架以充實空軍力量、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日本　訂購長蘆鹽　在津成立共販會社</h3>
<p>每年　購三百萬擔</p>
<p>專供化學及民食用</p>
<p>天津通信、長蘆鹽輸往日本事、近已具體化、所差者爲辦法尚待冀察政務會之核准、查此事日方蓄意促成其實現、非伊朝夕、在日本食用及化學工業上需用、約須外鹽五百萬擔輸入、以補不足、往者凡此不足數目、悉求給於非洲·及我國之青島、歐戰初起、日佔青島、嘗腐心於精鹽廠之建設、當時曾有十數廠設立、迨後華府會議、青島主權還我、日精鹽廠雖停辦、但仍訂有條約、准日本購買青鹽三百萬擔應用、尚欠之二百餘擔、則求給於非洲、自非洲戰事發生、食鹽輸出不易、目前日方因側重國內化學工業之發展、需鹽有增無減、所以特別求購尋塲合、於是轉注於蘆鹽、僞冀東政府成立後、一度截扣蘆鹽外運、其後經交涉解決、但漢沽·塘沽·蘆台·三灘垞舊日存鹽約千五百萬擔、日方乃以賤價購買、前後已運去兩批、達一萬二千五百餘擔、長蘆鹽運使署、深以此事妨害鹺政、復與關係各方面接洽、除冀東方面、另有相當辦法外、對日方購買、已成不可拒絕之勢、故特商一原則、希望彼此信守、且不致因蘆鹽外輸、影響華北民食、因此日方乃有蘆鹽共販會社之組織、由三井·三菱·岩久商店·三家共同合資、在津設立、堵心　爲接購蘆鹽外運機關、至輸出關稅·及裝運地點、尚待研究、須俟雙方同意方可實行起運、據聞長蘆鹽年產七百萬擔、除日方購去者外、下餘尚足華北民食、日方在華北購運蘆鹽、預定約三百萬擔左右、青島方面、因運抵門司、每擔運費合日金一元七十錢、若由華北運去、運費可省若干、故停往該方購　、將來擬用大型汽船裝運、三百萬擔之分配、食用鹽約八十萬擔、化學用百五十百萬擔、朝鮮方面、化學及食用約七十萬擔、現在蘆鹽價每包十元、（每包五百斤即一擔）至所謂用化學工業、比較最重要者、爲製炭酸曹達·井硝品、去年日本曹達運銷華北達三百萬桶、每桶值價二十餘元、在昔日方爲曹達入超國家、屆至去年、始一度而爲出超國家、華北向爲英美法之曹達銷塲、自日貨輸到、竟後來居上、侵奪英美法商塲勢力、故此次購運蘆鹽之事、列強殊予以深切注意也、（二十九日）</p>
<h3>皖西　茶市可趨繁榮</h3>
<p>四縣產銷概觀</p>
<p>駐軍維護茶市</p>
<p>蚌埠通信、皖西六霍一帶、向爲產茶區域、如世稱之六安梅片、尤名馳中外、與西湖之龍井、洞庭之碧螺、徽州之大方、黃山之毛峯、並稱於世、比年匪騷擾、茶商裹足、茶業日就衰頹、馴至金融枯竭、農商交困、所幸該區殘匪、已被國軍次第剿平、最近六立霍等縣茶區治安、由負責綏靖之李默庵劉茂恩兩部、派隊維持、並分兵駐守各大茶市、保護茶商、皖省府復與銀行界接洽放欵、貸與茶農、以資救濟茶業、現在春茶即將上市、魯徐等處茶商、連日紛紛過蚌、前往設莊、準備販運、預料本年茶市、可望呈繁榮氣象、皖西災黎、稍獲蘇息之機、查皖西茶業、關繫國計民生、至爲重要、頃特調查該業種種情況、分述如次、</p>
<p>產茶區域</p>
<p>皖西產茶區域、計有六安·立煌·霍邱·霍山·四縣、其最著之處、如六安之獨山·青山·蘇家埠·兩河口·落地崗·山王河·毛坦廠·立煌之蔴埠·大小馬店·胡家店·流波疃·蓮花山·五長灣·南水田·裂石店·楊家灘·簡家冲·船半冲·第三冲·蘇口·油坊店·霍邱之萊家集、開順街·白塔坂、霍山之諸佛庵·斑竹圍·大化坪·五奇河·管家渡·濫泥坳·慢水河·黑石渡等處、俱爲產茶最著之區、</p>
<p>茶葉種類</p>
<p>皖西山明水秀、茶爲出產大宗、因有裹山外山之分、品類斯有等差、就大體上言之、茶之色香質味、以裏山出產爲較優、外山次之、六安西南暨立煌一帶所產者、稱爲黑茶、以蘇口流波疃出產爲最良、霍山以南所產者、稱爲黃茶、以諸佛庵出品爲較佳、黑茶稱爲花箱、黃茶稱爲板簍、茶之發芽、在柳樹生葉之後、至清明榖雨之間、葉漸長成、此時滿山茶樹一片碧綠、葱鬰可愛、及屆榖雨、始行摘採、此際調之春茶、採後再發萌芽、過立夏四十天、方能摘採、此時謂之梓茶、色香質味、較春茶稍差、梓茶採後、再發芽而採下者、謂之三茶、較梓茶更差、此後發芽、即不摘取、須保存茶樹之元氣、以備來年再採、</p>
<p>出產量數</p>
<p>皖西既爲產茶區域、茶農對於茶季、異常重視、採茶工作、多由婦人暨妙齡少女爲之、且流行有採茶歌曲、在茶山歌唱時、清脆悠揚、婉轉可聽、別有一種風趣、茶葉摘下後、須經火燻炒、多以男子爲之、燻炒之後、尚須揀取、謂之揀茶、揀出細杪、稱爲銀針雀舌、純葉稱爲梅片、或稱瓜片、每屆茶季、所用茶工、多至十萬人以上、近二三年來、每屆由皖省當局令皖西移民辦事處、介紹邊區災民、赴茶區工作、爲救濟荒歉之計、六霍立霍四縣、每年出產之上等茶、計約四十萬簍、每簍以十斤計、綜合已達四百萬斤之多、亦可覘其產量之豐矣、</p>
<p>行銷概況</p>
<p>皖西茶葉、以魯省爲最大銷塲、每年茶季、濟南等處茶商前往販運者、絡繹於途、其行銷魯境者、佔十之七八、次如北平·天津·及蘇北·豫東·皖北·一帶、亦有相當銷塲、　曾銷至遼寗、九一八後、無由運達、在昔承平時代、茶葉上市期間、皖西各縣鎮、市面頗形繁榮、金融亦大爲活躍、釐金局存在時、每歲收入、亦以茶釐爲大宗、裁釐後、每年由皖省財政廳舉辦茶業短期營業稅、設局征收、懷遠且設有查騐所、查去歲春茶市價、每簍在三元以上、本季行情平穩、大約不致暴漲或慘跌、逆料今年茶市、可望稍有起色也、（二十九日）</p>

<h3>滬甬公攤　招商三北破歷年紀錄</h3>
<p>滬甬航路、自招商·三北·太古·寗紹·四家、同盟公攤以來、年年均招商三北受太古寗紹方面攤進、獨去年情形大異、一反歷年紀錄、由三北招商攤出、此誠華輪之好現象也、今將該路公攤之已據公布者詳情錄報如下、</p>
<p>營業總額</p>
<p>去年滬甬一路之貨物運輸、總計所得水腳爲四十九萬三千零八十八元九角四分、此係淨收之實額、其中已除去百分之二十五分回佣矣、此項總數中、招商局新江天輪佔十二萬八千九百五十八元九角二分、三北公司之寗興輸佔十二萬八千一百九十三元七角六分、寗紹之寗紹輪佔十二萬一千八百五十六元一角、英商太古公司之新北京佔十四萬零八百元一角五分、</p>
<p>變遷原由</p>
<p>按歷年公攤、滬甬一路內、總以英商太古公司佔第一位、寗紹佔第二位、而三北招商、從未照比額達到成數、上年招商局經劉鴻生銳意整理、貨運突增、三北公司亦因鎮海口岸之貨、免收轉口稅之故、裝運最多、該一埠全年收五萬元水腳、而寗紹太古、以不停鎮海、遂致退落到第三第四位、將歷屆紀錄打破、變成太古寗紹攤進之局面、</p>
<p>公攤數額</p>
<p>茲經太古公司結出、上年滬甬四公司之公攤數目、計三北公司之收入、已超越所規定成數、應攤出水腳洋九千七百三十六元二角八分、招商局亦以新江天收入激增、亦應攤出七千七百八十八元三角五分、太古公司因貨腳成數不足、因攤進一萬一千一百七十九元一角一分、寗紹公司亦攤進六千三百四十五元四角九分、昨日已請各公司將應攤出之欵付出、即分歸攤進公司入帳、因打破歷年紀錄、故特誌之、</p>

<h3>上海之呢絨業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之二十）</p>
<p>本文所載之呢絨業，係包括製造與販賣而言。惟呢絨較高級之工業品，向由海外輸入，迄今仍以舶來品爲主，故本文所載，側重於呢絨販賣業，其製造業僅附帶及之。</p>
<h3>一，呢絨販賣業之沿革</h3>
<p>我國之有呢絨販賣業，當推滬市爲最早，迄今已有六十餘年之歷史。該業初創時，乃由西式裁縫（俗稱紅帮裁縫）兼營，規模極小，所配貨色，大抵皆係供給顧客裁衣之用，以致每决向洋行進貨僅數碼而已，即所謂「料頭料」。稍後漸由數家合作，規模較大，惟進貨仍以疋頭計（現在稱呢絨店爲拆貨店，即由此而起）。嗣後呢絨需要日廣，一部份之紅帮裁縫始獨樹一幟，蜆化爲專營呢絨之批發商。最先單獨設舖經營該業者爲老生記·全記·元泰等呢絨號。老生記已於歐戰後，因先令結價影響而倒閉，全記，元泰，迄今尚存。</p>
<p>至該業之盛衰，詳細言之，可分四個時期：第一時期自發軔至歐戰，爲該業之平穏期·自一九一九年至一九二零年爲該業之恐慌期，因歐戰告終，市面回復，先令突降，應付不及老遂相繼停業，如前述之老生記即其一例，而當時最轟傳一時者，當爲仁義公記呢絨號之被迫收歇。自一九二一年至一九二九年，則轉爲該業之黃金時代，如怡康。華孚泰，義昌泰等之勃起，華興之擴充，美綸之添設大綸副號，均在該期內。自一九二九年至現在，則爲該業不安之秋，世界經濟之衰落，海外匯價之上落不定，以及國內「九一八」「一二八」之變故，皆有重大關係。至其淸淡景况，以區域言，則以虹口及四川路爲重，而以大新街爲輕，最近且有漸趨好轉之象。</p>
<p>本市之呢絨販賣業，復可分區觀察。按調查所得，該業集中於虹口·南京路·及老北門·一帶，四川路及大新街决之，與霞飛路·西門等處相若。考呢絨販賣業之策源地爲虹口，然後延及南京路及棋盤街一帶。設於南京路者以榮昌祥呢絨號爲最早，設於棋盤街者，以美綸爲最早，至老北門方面則推顧瑞記爲首。現在該業中規模最大者爲棋盤街之春和永·華興·何錦豐·兆記·怡康·聯興·王興昌·等數家。</p>
<p>按經售之呢絨品質而言，該業又可分爲三級：第一級爲虹口南京路方面，以其所售呢絨品質較高（即所謂花式貨或套頭料），售價頂眞，變動較少，棋盤街之呢絨號决之，蓋其所售之件，以大路貨（即普通貨）爲主，雖亦兼售套頭貨，但售價非一成不變較有還價餘地。至老北門一帶又决之，目下呢絨交易之重心，已移至棋盤街方面，此可於各區最近二年每年之營業額見之（據該業中人之一般估計）：本市各區呢絨號每年營業額估計表，虹口方面，二百萬元弱，南京路方面，仝前，棋盤街方面，八百萬元强，四川路方面，一百萬元强，老北門方面，八十萬元弱。（未完）</p>

<h3>兩廣實業攷察與國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨工業之機括；一爲原料取給問題，一爲產品銷售問題，此兩問題之解决，必先從全國合作，一致以抵抗外貨爲目標。顧如何合作，必自玫察各地實業入手。兩廣爲西南大都會，允爲貨物產銷集散區域，有値得玫察之價値，兩廣實業玫察團之組織，此爲最大旨趣。自赴粵桂實地觀察以後，備悉兩省工商業之實况，與經濟之現狀，深覺原料之取給，與商品之交換，在在與上海可以發生極密切之關係。兩廣人民富有愛國思想，服用國貨，爲國民畢生之素性，廣東地大人衆社會之消費量旣極大，而生活能力，較爲健全，故國貨之銷行，比較各地爲易。雖有幾種工業均屬省營範圍，但外省貨物，亦在歡迎之列。果能幣制統一，捐稅簡單，則各地之貨物源源運粵，國貨前途，極有希望。廣西物產不薄，原料更多，如桐油，茴香油，皮革，林木，鑛產等，年有數千萬元，滬上各工廠，各就營業所需，儘可大量購取，桂人以所得之貨價，輸入紗布機器等外來之貨品，則更爲兩利。兩地社會人士，對於提倡國貨均有熱烈之懷抱，如廣州之提倡國貨委員會南寗之國貨展覽會，均有煊爛之成績，而廣西人工之布服布履，允爲服用國貨之模範。據兩省人士言，人民近來關於服裝與日用品，以採用國貨爲榮，購辦外貨爲辱，卽如婦女界，亦多力持服用國貨之主張，允爲可慰。惟是國貨工業，無軍事爲後盾，無政策之保護，苦心奮鬥，往往遭受失敗。白健生先生謂，工業建設，倘無軍事爲之保障，政策爲之調劑，往往爲飛機大砲之犧牲品，故欲工業建設之成功，非有充裕之自衛力量保障不可。此眞一針見血之談，故廣西有進出口貿易處以外，又有變相關稅之餉捐局，對於外貨與國貨之稅則，分等徵收，無形中已銷滅外貨進口不少。此種政策，吾人極爲國貨界同人稱幸不罪。希望兩廣當局，經此决攷察團聯絡以後，再作進一步之聯絡，或設機關，或特的團體直接往來，以溝通各地間之產品。於國內和國外貿易，均可立於優勝之地位。則此行之收穫，詎不大歟。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨小工業</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>「空言無補，事重實踐。」這一句話，已是現階段我們每一個從事國貨運動者的口頭禪了。</p>
<p>的確。國貨前途的發展，是只有兩條進行的途徑，我們一方面果然要努力服用國貨運動，使許多過去牢建崇拜洋貨心理的人們，獲得新的覺醒，同時，在另一方面，我們必定更要竭力設法增加國貨生產，積極提倡很多的小工業，埋頭苦幹，腳踏實地的向前邁進，替我國貨生產事業的前途，建立最堅强的基礎。</p>
<p>大家知道，我國本是一個以農立國的國家，他現有的經濟組織，是由過去的「農村自給自足的經濟」，銳化而來的所以，大工業的不易舉辦，因於客觀環境的限制，外來侵略勢力的威脅，它的現狀是奄無生氣。而小工業呢？我們細察它的生產和出品方面，却都還很感不够，允其是一般日常用品，還有很多的物品，都正待創造，需要我們不屈不撓的精神，來努力奮鬥，以冀精美的出品，來代替在華市塲獨佔的洋貨，奠定國貨工業的雛型，在這經濟崩潰，洋貨充斥，失業恐慌，十分尖銳化的時侯，能够救濟失業同胞，振興實業，盡繁榮工商，復興民族的力量。</p>
<p>至於如何去着手舉辦小工業，在這時侯，許多事業家都因鑒於全國市面的不景氣，而裹足不前，其實這也是十分「因噎廢食」的觀念，要知道，目前國產事業的發展，是必須企業界的奮勇前進，和全體民衆的一致愛護。所以，在這裏，我敢提出舉辦時值得注意的幾點，供給從事者的參考和借鏡：</p>
<p>第一，產銷合作和經濟周轉：小工業的創辦開始，一方面宜設法加入國貨集團，如國貨產銷合作恊會，和各地中國國貨公司，努力適合大衆需求，樹立社會信譽。一方面更宜嚴密研究經濟周轉的暢快，獲得與金融界的聯絡，利用信用小借欵與實行承兌匯票，免除經濟拮据上的憂慮。</p>
<p>第二，技術人才和國貨原料：從事小工業者，爲獲到精美的出品，和成本的减低，對於技術人員，宜有審愼的揀選，同時，更應竭力採用國產原料，使國內的原料事業，也得有充分發展。</p>
<h3>要認淸自己是一個中國人</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>——「國貨救國」纔有希望——</p>
<p>本來是呼好的一個中國人，本國明明已有了很好的「國貨」，爲什麽？一定要捨不得「洋貨」，要服用「洋貨」，這不是奇嗎？</p>
<p>其實，細想起來，這一個問題，是很容易答的，一點兒都不奇。</p>
<p>要知道，爲什麽好好的一個中國人，本國旣已有了很好的「國貨」不用，而定要採用「洋貨」？老實說，實在爲的是中國人，自己認不淸自己是一個中國人啊！</p>
<p>唯其是自己認不淸自己是一個中國人，纔所以會忍心置「國貨」於不顧，而服用「洋貨」！如果，自己能瞉認淸自己是一個中國人，我可以大膽的說，斷不會抹却良心，甘做「洋迷」。</p>
<p>所以，我要在這裏，希望大家，從今以後要認淸自己是一個中國人，並不是一個外國人。這樣，纔能彀知道不愛「洋貨」愛「國貨」，纔可以不致再做「洋貨」的奴隸，纔可以不致再做「洋貨推銷員」。那麽，「國貨救國」，纔有希望了。</p>
<h3>國貨蒸汽輾路機的成功</h3>
<p>怡</p>
<p>— 怡廬</p>
<p>河南省農工機器廠製造　價廉物美堪與外貨爭勝</p>
<p>在這幾年來的我國，對於公路的建築，的確是非常重視，所以各省巿都積極的進行建築公路，據我們所知道的，全中國已經有五屬是以上的公路了，這自然是一個很好的現象，可是人們祇知道建築公路的利益，對於建築公路的一筆鉅大之漏巵，却忽略了，別的且不說，就是建築公路所用的必需品－蒸汽輾路機，完全是用的外國貨。這種蒸汽輾路機的價値，是非常的昂貴，每一架總要一萬幾千元，以全國所用的蒸汽輾路機而言，這一筆漏扈，眞也足以使人咋舌了！不過築路是非用這種機器不可，爲着沒有國貨可以代替，雖知這是瀟扈，却也無法挽回，這不是很痛心的一伴事嗎？但是現在我來報告一個消息給讀者們，就是我們河南農工機器製造廠，居然能够仿製了！而且所用的材料，又都是國貨，這可說是國貨年中的一個好消息了！並且這種國貨蒸汽輾路機的價値，比較舶來品要省到一半，每具只需七八千元，就可以造成，該廠正在設法推銷，同時，並籌集大量的資本，來作製造的用處。關於該機的製造動機，是由於該廠的蚤體工程技師，目的一半是爲處挽回漏巵；一半是爲着發展營業，據該廠的表示：此項蒸汽輾路機的構造，和舶來品有點不同，但是功用却相等。全機的重量，的九噸多點，其機件計有　鍋爐：是機關車式火管鍋爐，燃燒烟煤，燃燒的面積爲四八四平方寸。傳熱的面積，火管二十六根，計五九平方吋。有效的汽壓，每平方吋一百磅。鍋爐的後半部是水箱。開機的時候，由水泉吸收水箱裏的水，而傳入鍋爐，煤烟則由火管傳到烟箱，再轉入烟筒裏麽。　原動機：就是複式的蒸汽機，汽缸有大小三只，小的直徑是五吋二分；大的直徑是七吋七分；蒸汽由鍋爐發生，存於汽缸的奢法。開機的時侯就開汽門，蒸汽就由汽管而入錯汽筒，再由錯汽筒轉入小汽缸，小汽缸的餘氣，仍回到錯汽筒，而入大汽缸的後面，再轉到烟筒裏以通風。　變速輪系：這是牙輪的變化器，與灣軸相連。　倒正車：這是倒車和正車所用的機器，　方向舵：這是管向左向右所用的一個機器，如果向左轉，就撥動左邊輪舵上的一個鐵練：向右轉則撥向右邊的一個鐵練。此外還有加油和添水的兩奢機器。他們已經製成了一架；月前曾經公開試來，成績是很好的，所以這國貨蒸汽輾路機已經到了完全成功的步驟了！</p>
<h3>國貨通訊</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>（自南寗發）</p>
<p>南寗爲廣西省會，近來商業比較繁盛，我們到南寗的時侯，恰好舉行國貨展覽會，到會參觀的，每天有一千多人，婦女界也佔二分之一，展覽的物品，除本省物產外，以廣東上海國貨工廠的出品居多，商會主席林伯音君，省黨部常委黃達明君，均言南寗人極富愛國心，外國貨品，不易在市上行銷，人民時時自動組織檢查隊，恊助機關至商店檢查，加以本省餉捐局，對於國貨收稅甚輕，外國貨則取稅極重，卽以紙烟而論，外國紙烟，幾絕跡於本省，可見外國貨欲行銷桂省，難若登天，至婦女界近來亦以官廳之以身作則，屏除奢靡，故衣食住行，抱抱撙節主義所用之物品，以國貨爲主。曾至市街一觀，見各肆陳列之貨品，確以國貨爲多，價亦便宜，惟桂幣須一元五角合滬幣一元，故上海所來國貨，價須略高，林主席委員及商會同人，均謂今後當更努力提倡國貨，多辦國貨公司，以爲提倡，黨部黃常委願領導地方團體及婦女界組織服用國貨團，爲各地創。白副總司令亦極言願以全力爲國貨界帮忙，務使國貨界之困難，逐漸减少，並謂對外貿易，倘無政策爲之後盾，確極艱苦，願就力之所及，爲國貨界稍謀發展，拳之意尤爲國貨界同人所事情念不忘云。</p>

<h3>國藥展覽會宣言</h3>
<p>— 上海市國醫公會</p>
<p>中國醫學。積數千年之經騐。而能見信於社會。流播於海外。曩者政府旣有中央國醫館之組織。最近復有中醫條例之頒布。此固學術上自具超越之精神。而藥物之效騐卓特。實佔大半。試舉其長。厥有二端。國藥善取病之癓結根源。不尙膚淺迅捷。以取效於一時。而得收王道之功。此其一。又善治複雜兼夾之混合症。而鮮副作用及劇烈毒質。故無反應後患。合於國人體質。此其二。况國藥十九爲純粹國產。價値低廉。遠於舶來。不特適合民衆之經濟程度。而種植採取。關係農村生計。實爲國家命脈所寄。坐是世界各國競以研究中藥爲近世紀最新發現之無盡寳藏。國產藥材。載綑以去。成爲出口大宗。本會同人。僉覺國藥之在今日。實屬我國絕大問題。爰就滬上聯合有關係之藥材業國藥業參燕業。並得植物園之贊助。組織國藥展覽會。幾度籌備。得與市民相見。而不能不再鄭重致言於參觀者凡五點。一在觸目豐美之藥物中。應知我國富源之所在。二在栽培泡製之過程中。應知關係民生之急切。三在功能效力之偉大中。應知價値之貴重。四在選擇之縝密中。應知道地之考察。五在貴重之材料中。應知眞偽之辨別。良由本會之所希冀者。在瀏覽時得多方面之認識。而洞明國藥之宜積極提倡。初非僅供一部份之欣賞。而惟感國藥之豐富卓越已也。謹此宣言。</p>
<h3>舉辦國藥展覽會感言</h3>
<p>— 上海市國藥業同業公會</p>
<p>藥石之神妙。一言以蔽之。在於用得其當。是以入參有時無效。而砒霜亦能救人。</p>
<p>我國之有醫藥。發明遠在五千年前。史蹟彪炳。實爲中華民族殊榮。歷代賢哲。更相繼努力。披沙揀金。卽物以騐效。卽效以求理。絞腦汁。嘔心血。使千數百種藥味莫不具有獨特功效。雖西醫謂爲不起化學作用不堪入藥之石膏滑石。對症而發。皆爲妙品。可見國藥功效之神妙。有非膚淺之流所能窮其原理者。此不僅籍載可稽。卽受科學洗禮之時彥亦都推許。</p>
<p>自海禁開放。帝國主義文化經濟。匿傳敎師之後而來施展其侵略之野心。革履之所踐踏。惡因之所埋伏。敲門有磚。播少惠以結人心。醫藥乃首當其衝焉。降至今日。帝國主義文化經濟侵略。大功告成。我國家民生經濟遂遘空前恐慌。我國藥物。徒擁遠久歷史。神妙功效。乃竟不克拒外來勢力於國門之外。爲國家經濟。保持一方面之完整。良足慨嘆。</p>
<p>雖然。因帝國主義文化經濟侵略之成功。使國藥不能不受若干損失。但國藥在治療功效上之價値。根本未受動搖。甚且因比較而益顯著。自信心亦愈堅定。在鞏固國家經濟壁壘意識碎礪之下。國人將相率割絕以往之迷戀而爲此壁壘中之戰士。爲必然之趨勢。在此時機下。國藥以其廣厚之根基。優良之材料。加以最新之工事。其前途之光明。無可限量。故今日所受損失。可斷爲祇如浮雲之掩日。爲時甚暫。豈長此受人壓抑者。今茲國藥展覽會之動機。蓋由是而抽萌。</p>
<p>國藥展覽會之意義。在促起全國上下之注意。知我國有如許藥味。以及其治療功效上之價値。激發才智之士研究之興趣·倘蒙社會賢達。更進而匡導之。策勵之。使理想有實現之期。國家民族。利賴何似。不禁馨香祈禱之。</p>

<h3>職業補習敎育的十種重要性（一）</h3>
<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>職業補習敎育、在全部職業敎育區域中、已經漸漸感覺到他的地位重要、或者竟可以說、他已經漸漸和正式職業學校敎育、「分庭抗禮」、恐怕這也是目前社會環境和需要逼迫他做成這個樣子罷、</p>
<p>中國社會、原是一個不健全的社會、可是、因爲不健全、或竞格外需要職業補習敎育來補助、使他不健全的毛病能遂漸减輕、並且慢慢兒可以把他健全起來、也說不定、</p>
<p>所可惜的、中國辦理職業敎育、已有三十多年、而對於職業敎育範圍內職業補習敎育、尙未能使多數人感覺或了解他的重要性啊、我在此地、要做這一篇文字、却是具有一些大聲疾呼的意思、想把他的重要性——也就是在目前中國社會所看出的重要性、一一說出來、讓大家知道、允其是希望我們敎育界同人、加以注意、共同負起責任來把他大大推進一下、</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>兒童敎育、需要普及、這是天經地義、無容疑惑的事、假定說、兒童敎育已經普及了、那末、兒童受過國民敎育之後、他的年齡還小、就能够在社會上謀生麼、自立麼、送到農工商場去當學徒、就能得着各種職業上的新知識新技能麼、如若不能、應該怎樣、這却是一個問題啊、說到此地、似乎自然而然的、就要敎人想到職業補習敎育上面來了、有了職業補習敎育、便可專來爲一班受過小學敎育（或初級或高級）預備入職業界或已入職業界的青年、供給他適宜的訓練、有了這種訓練、那末、就他個人說、旣可增進職業知能、文化學識、使他在社會上能够謀經濟生活的自立、而就社會說便可以改良舊職業、創造新職業、爲整個民族國家的經濟謀發展、這樣關係的重大、還用說麽、而他的重要性、不已經是顯然可見了麼、這是從受過國民敎育的靑年身上看出職業敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>况且今日中國義務敎育、尙不能普及、一般靑年和成人、未受敎育、目不識丁的、比比皆是、試問、對於這一班人、將如何辦、推廣識字敎育、以掃除文盲罷、固然是目前當務之急、可是、僅僅識字、就能解决他們整僩生活問題麽、我想、不能罷、那末、如何辦呢、說到此地、恐怕要敎人想到職業補習敎育了、我以爲識字敎育、不妨和職業補習敎育、混合起來一塊兒辦、那就是在文字中加入職業的材料、在文字外要有職業的練習、如此則大多數失學靑年和成人如何敎育的問題、皆可拿職業敎育的方法來解決他了、凡是青年成人受過人業補習敎育的、不但能夠做國民、也同時能夠做生產者、他不僅能識字、並且能做工、如此則敎育作用、便更覺有效、更覺遠大了、這是從未受過國民敎育的靑年成人身上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>不但此也、我們中國現在到處鬧窮、一個學生進大學、固不容易、理中學也何嘗容易、就是進職業學校、也還是要花錢啦、父兄替子弟忙學費、苦得不了、而學生在校肄業、本學期不知下學期事、心神也異常不安、並且學成出校、有沒有職業可就、還是問題、試到內地去看一看、這種嗟怨之聲、到處皆有、甚且口口聲聲說學校害人、如若有了職業補習敎育、就可以補救許多了、子弟小學畢業、不必一定升學、儘可送入職業界、雖然農場商店工廠、學不到什麼新智識、但是有了職業補習學校以應其需要、白天做事、早晨或晚上入學、所學的一部分是職業課程、一部分是文化課程、學一點、得一點、和升學所得的是一樣、或者還要切實些、而父兄忙學費之苦、靑年憂慮學背不給之苦、完全沒有了、你看、他的效力多麽大啊、這是從父兄供給子弟學費情形看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>學校調查　上海法國學校概況（二）　胡祖蔭</p>
<p>二、校舍與設備</p>
<p>該校校舍係由前法國俱樂部房屋改造而成，所以校舍全部不能稱合敎育的理想。全校校舍佔地的十餘畝，交通頗稱便利。該校是日校性質，所以沒有宿舍。校舍樓下是幼稚園小學一二年級敎室曁各部辦公室；二樓三樓是小學中高年級曁中學各年級普通及專科敎室。總計普通敎室有二十三問；特殊敎室有自然室，音樂室，美術室，圖書室，大禮堂等。因爲全部校舍是由俱樂部房屋改造的，所以各敎室的大小不一，探光與通氣亦欠完備。運動塲面積倒很大；且將中小學遊戲場地劃開，可使中小學學生不致衝突。雨操場亦有兩處，分別爲中小學學生之用。其他如飯堂，衣帽寄存處，飲水處，男女生厠所，醫務處，廚房等均屬可用。</p>
<p>在設備方面，學生桌椅多用雙人式，且式樣欠新，不易移動。敎室佈置頗爲簡單；敎學用具亦不多見。其他各科設備用具，如自然科設備，體育科用具等均係按照法團敎育部所訂標凖置備，且每年均有的欵從事添置補充。</p>
<p>三、行政概況</p>
<p>行政組織　法國敎育行政與學校行政都是採取集權制。法國敎育部規定全國各級學校的設施事項，如敎學大綱，敎學時數，敎科書，各科設佛標準等。在學校方面，行政權則完全集中在校長身上，校長根據敎育部法令全權處理校務。從前法公董局只設立該校一所，那時該校校務直接歸法公　局節制。現在法公董局又開辦雷米學校一所，及華童小學兩所，乃另在局中設立敎育處，專司管理此四所學校及補助私立學校等事項。</p>
<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>世運足球預選　上海華北兩區選手明日赴港</h3>
<p>預選竣事定本月下旬來滬　體恊會派周家騏隨任照料</p>
<p>我國參加世運足球隊、定四月四日起在港舉行預選、從初選三十人中、挑選精銳廿人、組成中華隊選拔竣事後、將於五月中來滬練習、然後再與其他選手一同放洋赴德、本埠及華北兩區初選選手、張榮才·李寗·梁樹棠·孫錦順·陳鎮和·賈幼良·譚福楨等七人、原定今日離滬赴港、參加預選、現因事改於本月二日晨九時三刻乘大來公司麥金蘭總統號輪啟程南下、中華全國體育協進會並派周家騏隨同前往照料一切、隸屬優游麾下之陳鎭和張榮才梁樹棠三人、初擬於本月七日搭胡佛總統輪啟程、以便參加四五兩日對法商之西聯足球賽、現因港方除十八日對港軍聯及十九日對混合隊之兩决正式賽外、尙有多塲練習賽、均提先於四月十日前舉行、故事實上已屬不及、乃决定放棄此項主張、仍於明晨偕孫李譚賈等一同首途云、</p>
<h3>王正廷博士談　我國參加世運目的</h3>
<p>共分三點</p>
<p>第十一屆世運、定本年九月中在德國柏林奧林匹克村舉行、吾國當局現正在積極籌備、擬參加足球·籃球·田徑·國術·游泳·競走等多項、茲據全國體育協進會會長王正廷博士、對國光社記者稱、吾國對於歷屈世運、僅上屆曾選派劉長春一人參加、惟亦無成績可言、本屆吾國　兵秣馬、擬作大規模之參加、其目的共有三點、　過去吾國體育雖不斷進展、惟究因與外界接觸機會太少、每致隔膜、此决參加、吾國得分希望雖甚渺茫、惟籍此良機、可使吾國運動界對外有深切之認識、　社會之造成、端賴人類之合作、而體育一項、允能表示合作意義之重大、本屆世運、歐美參加各國、無不力挽同心、通力合作、斤斤於錦標之得失、吾國雖無此種冀圖、而籍此亦可養成此種精神、　吾國此决選拔代表、每屬目於新進有希望之人材、至若年事已高、或過去曾喧赫一時之運動員則反遭割愛、關於此點、負責選拔諸公、實別具苦心云云、王氏繼稱、吾國代表隊定六月初出國、本人亦將伴同赴德云、</p>

<p>昨日雜糧交割、小麥因陳貨不豐、現貨陸續配廠、故期麥結果一無交割、惟車黃豆之交割數量、甚覺巨大、因油廠買進期貨、均預備收貨、而拋售者則均爲產區之客戶、是以互擴之下、實在交割數、竟達一百十三車之巨、計五號交十二車、六號交四車、七號交一車、十五號交八車、十六號交二車、廿四號交廿二車、廿六號交二車、卅五號交六車、卅八號交卅七車、四十一號交一車、四十五號交十八車、收進者計七號收二車、九號收九車、十九號收十二車、廿五號收廿九車、卅號收廿八車、卅五號收卅三車、三部分均爲油廠收去、此外洋莊芝麻計交割六票、豆油計交割一千六百擔云、</p>
<h3>美麥市況仍得堅定</h3>
<p>海外小麥市況、西南依舊無雨、市況仍得堅定、上週可見供給估計減少一·一四九·〇〇〇斛、加麥減少一·二三八·〇〇〇斛、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥　三月二十八日　三月三十日　上落</p>
<p>五月份　九六·五〇　九七·〇〇　漲〇·五〇</p>
<p>七月份　八七·五〇　八七·七五　漲〇·二五</p>
<p>加拿大小麥　三月二十八日　三月十日　上落</p>
<p>五月份　八二·三七　八二·六二五　漲〇·二五</p>
<h3>米市尚屬平定</h3>
<p>白粳銷場本街稍活</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源、共到四十餘號、（貨共九千餘石）、本街銷場平常、包　天津煙台威海街等辦　粳六七百包、薄稻二千四五百包、故市況平定、薄稻厚粳等價悉無榮辱、杜洋尖及陰變兀亦平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源、三十一二號、市上白粳店　稍轉活絡、市形緊起數分至一角、午市形勢轉定、薄稻零銷平常、價見定勢、陰兀轉緊、白元到銷兩平、價無榮辱、羊埠尖到貨無幾、零拆尚可、價形見緊、其餘各貨、均屬平定、</p>
<h3>客秈形勢稍見軟弱</h3>
<p>—惟貨主仍不肯貶價脫售—</p>
<p>昨日客秈市況、長江一帶續有到埠、即台温各地亦復接連抵申、而江西米存到兩多、已爲目下客米之中堅、昨日客圃完全停頓、本街初無暢辦、故各米一律形勢軟弱、市乃步疲之趨勢、惟貨主心思甚堅、不肯貶價脫手、故市面雖疲、行情尚未跌落、祗高檔各貨未有成交、及午後散市復有本街鄉莊與小團戶等收買江西機晚米二千多包、行情立即回砌三五分、高機晚又開至十一元二角、中十一元零五分、最次小至十元零四角半、共計開出贛晚四千五百包、早米糙米各一百多包、江北米五百包、安慶米三百包、湘油五百包、温台米一千二百九十包、洋米祗有回籠暹邏米錄二百噸、小絞二百包、其他西貢小絞等因議價不合、致未成交、</p>
<h3>油價上漲菜籽暢銷</h3>
<p>新菜籽拋開一萬餘包</p>
<p>菜籽市況、在油價暴漲之下、銷場得以興奮、上週廣幫曾辦去平湖貨二批、日昨續交五百包、售價漲起五分、開七元八角、刻下新菜籽已有拋開兩批、訂平湖·蘇州貨分六七兩月份交價爲七元四角七分、成交一萬二千五百包、訂蕪湖貨分七八兩月份交、價爲七元七角半、成交二千包、均由日本洋行吃進、</p>
<h3>糖市　汕匯回縮糖價轉漲</h3>
<p>國產潮糖、自汕匯步漲以來、適值申銷不振、市勢至爲萎靡、號貨久擯未開、行方亦觀望不進、但據昨日汕頭電訊、形勢轉緊、不特汕匯回縮八元、即糖價一致見升、如赤糖漲起四角、青糖亦漲一角、加以匯水關水須加上一角、此後由市或將出此轉機、昨枝赤號盤已隨升二三角、以十二元七角開出百餘包、</p>
<p>公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨二十二元、轉口貨六元九角八分、東赤白以及本廠綿白均原價、無變動、預測國產粵粗白今日標價或有轉緩之望、蕪步跌已達八角許、疲極回好、亦可能耳、</p>
<h3>南北貨　温州橘餅市價鬆動</h3>
<p>温州橘餅、適來以銷路轉減、趨勢送鬆、現市開盤、前後已跌去一元、故湖南·長沙·等處去胃復動、聞產價亦鬆、劃申較小半元之譜、因此廈門所來軟餅、原價竟乏受手、亦須隨跌、方有銷路云、</p>
<h3>金針菜價轉穩定</h3>
<p>金針菜自市價回跌以來、因粵閩兩幫、去胃不動、客貨均少開出、昨聞大興菜已有售出四十餘包、貨品稍有高下、價爲二十四元三角、至二十四元八角、又某行日前開出利泰徐州菜一百包、二十二元半、據云客方尚不肯脫售、市勢有轉穩定之象、</p>
<h3>油市　柏蠟跟桐油上升</h3>
<p>柏蠟市況、價格陷於盤谷、皂廠去路雖健、惜燭淘銷路呆滯、存貨一時尚難消化、上週桐油狂漲、各油跟漲、（見二十一日本報）上星期內、柏蠟均起變化、漢訊、拆雪十五元六角至八角、麻城十五元二角至四角、（均市稱）荊津跟升、麻城客意尚欲扳高、浙訊、禾本十八元零金蘭　砠十八元三四角、川電、河乾水涸、輸運困難、兼之棧存稀薄、故近到貨不多、三月二十六日、川幫信昌、出四十餘支、（每支八餅重約市稱三擔零）、價開一百三十六元、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵煙廠採辦甚旺</h3>
<p>紫銅新貨已有裝到</p>
<p>二百鎊美國會司鐵、自到貨軋缺之後、本埠同業皆不肯輕易脫手、致市上流通貨甚感缺乏、前昨公和祥大阪諸棧、雖有現貨裝到、但太半被香煙廠購去、市存仍嫌稀少、標準開價依然挺硬、老鋼廠貨　籍沽三十六元、新鋼廠貨三十五元、野雞貨三十四元、查昨日全市開出、達八百餘箱、係香煙公司·製罐廠·餅乾公司等辦去、惟客幫生意、仍無若何動辦云、</p>
<p>紫銅復明公和祥碼頭、到有新貨三十五噸、查爲本埠某九金號定貨、市場因無斷檔之虞、行情每擔開五十六元、比前好起一元有餘、聞天津漢口諸幫已拋去百餘擔、本街同業亦有拆去數十擔之　、</p>
<h3>青鉛鐵現貨軋缺飛俏</h3>
<p>青鉛鐵近日現貨頓形軋缺、故市上之採辦者益見踴躍、故行情飛俏、每箱開至三十一元、比前漲一元、查昨日漢口幫辦去五十箱、本街熱水瓶廠·香煙廠等亦辦去二百八十餘箱、因此流通貨愈見寥少、故行情開價又有續好之希望、據洋行消息、此貨在近二三月中、恐無到貨、預料市面前途、將更形飛俏也、</p>
<h3>一年來之金融（九）</h3>
<p>— 何伯雄</p>
<p>八　金融業之新動向及其興替</p>
<p>本年金融業之新動向，有如下列：</p>
<p>銀錢業匯劃集中　銀行與錢莊，案分二大集團，故錢莊之票據交換所——匯劃總會，與銀行之票據交換所，並不通氣，在去年六月間上海金融風潮發生以後，銀錢業雙方均感到非合一步驟，無以應付此嚴重之局面，因之由錢業聯合準備庫，與銀行票據交換所協議，凡錢莊向銀行所收之票據，統留錢業聯合準備庫代收，而銀行向錢莊所收之票據，亦統留票據盜掘所代表收取。其中計錢業方面之會員錢莊五十五家銀行方面之會員銀行三十七家，從此素來分野之銀錢業，開始合作，實堪欣幸也。</p>
<p>農地放欵及投資之踴躍　此現象爲去年度之最大特質，亦爲銀行界之貢獻，因此豫，鄂，皖，贛，四省農民銀行自去年四月一日起改組爲『中國農民銀行』，資本增加至一千萬元，添設四川，陜西，甘肅，貴州，湖南，各地分支行，專營農村業務救濟農村。此外有交通，金城，浙江興業，上海商業，及農民等五家銀行所發起，組織『農業合作貸欵團』，於去年二月九日在上海正式成立，施行於河南，河北，陜西，山東，安徽，浙江，江蘇等省，對於棉麥米稻絲茶，有組織合作社，以運用青苗貸欵，又設有倉庫，以供農產品之抵押，負責運銷，以利農產品之外輸。</p>
<p>小額信用放欵之興起　此項貸欵，乃以信用作擔保，以備一般無擔保品之市民借貸之用。自上海銀行創辦後，去年各銀行相率放行，計有新華，聚興誠，中國，國貨，上海信託，通易信託，中南，寗波實業，四明儲蓄會等，去年發展極爲迅速。</p>
<p>銀錢業恢復收受地產抵押　地產押欵，自二十二年起，因銀根緊急，地價狂跌，以致交易呆滯，去年均已酌量承做，故地產已較前年爲活動。</p>
<p>銀錢業推行商業承兌匯票　自國內白銀大量外流，市面籌碼深感缺乏，顧在上海綢緞業與電機絲織業二同業公會，爲增加籌碼，週轉金融計，施用商業承兌匯票，上海市銀行業同業公會，於四月九日開會，通過承兌匯票貼現業務之原則六項。上海錢業公會於四月十日開會通過商業承兌匯票施行原則，並通告同業各莊，凡屬往來行號，遇有上項票據，儘量收受，商業承兌匯票之施行，或可從此日漸推廣矣。</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3>電話用戶分類問題之研究</h3>
<p>— 麟</p>
<p>電話用戶之使用電話，雖具同一之意義，皆爲傳遞消息，但用戶之性質則又有不同，以其性質之不同，因之使用電話之决數，亦自有繁簡。如旅社餐館與一般住宅雖同樣裝用電話，但在事實上，旅社餐館使用電話之决數，必較住宅爲多，此蓋無可吾認者。以此之故，倘不論用戶性質如何，槪併爲一類，不予分別，不特非公平之道，且亦有過於含混之嫌。卽以電報而言，有政務，公務，私務，公益，以及其他種種名目之區別，電話亦猶是也。</p>
<p>歐美各國，對方電話分類早已實行，甚稱便利。我國過去各地話局，辦法分歧，素不一致，有已分類者，有未分類者，其已分類者，又各自爲政，曼無標凖，在用戶方面，負担輕重，殊感不公。直至去年交通部擬訂市內電話營業通則時，始於第六條中規定電話用戶依其性質，分爲甲乙丙丁四種，並於第七條規定：「電話用戶之種類有疑義時，由各局視其使用電話之性質審定之，用戶不得異議。用戶性質有變更時，應隨時報告更改之。」此項通則，公布後各地話局均已遵照實行，同時各局電話營業價目，亦經交部按照各地情形重行核定，除少數用戶不多業務簡單之局所，各種電話之月租費，暫歸一律外，其他各處，均依照甲乙丙丁四種用戶之性質，而分別規定其應納之話費，以期公允。就一般言，屬於丙種與乙種用戶者其應納之月租費，往往較甲種丁種爲多。蓋以其性質而定費用之多寡也。</p>
<p>上項通則施行以來，各方稱便，惟聞尙有極少數之用戶，不甚明瞭，例如一部分用戶依其性質應列乙種而以前誤列甲種，新章實行後，照章改正，列爲乙種，以每月增加一元租費之故，頗爲懹疑。其實此種懹疑，全係誤會，因此項通則，原爲公平用戶負担，並非以加價爲目的，事實上，前此用戶以分類失當而納較高之月租費者，均已一律减低。交通部爲求合理化起見，初亦未計及營業上之損失，此種誤會，一經解釋，自必恍然於懷也。</p>
<h3>長途電話用戶值得注意的幾個問題</h3>
<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>長途電話與有無綫電報，均爲現代通信交通之利器。交通部爲便利民衆通訊起見，除整理及擴充全國各地有無綫電報外，同時並積極進行長途電話之建設。例如各省長途電話之開放，九省長途電話幹綫工程之建設及西蘭公路沿綫各處長途話綫之擴展，均爲巨擘。長途電話旣爲民衆所利用，則用戶與各地電報局電話局或長途電話零售處（以下簡稱電局）之間，勢必在在發生接觸。對於下列各項，似宜切實注意。始能充分利用而免發生誤會。</p>
<p>對講時語言務須簡單扼要吾人拍發電報，因電文照章須按字計費，故電文務求簡耍達意，並不考究文字優美。長途電話現已改爲每决三分鐘，逾時須按兩次通話計費，發話人與受話人對講時所用言語，亦須力求簡單扼要，一切無關緊急之言語，可省則省，以免逾時增加話費負擔。</p>
<p>臨時請改加急通話之手績任何人在電局收費處繳付一决普通通話之話費後，適値話務繁忙，而本人所掛之號决序較後，一時當不能與對方通話者，可將原先取得之一次普通話費收據，連同應補之話費，向收費處聲請改掛加急通話之號。收費處查騐原給收據，確係未經通話，並已補足加急話費者（例如一决加急通話費應付九角，除已付一次普通通話費四角五分外，祇須補繳四角五分，因加急通話之價目爲普通話費之二倍也。），應卽另行換塡一决加急通話費之收據一紙，交給發話人持至通話處照加急通話之掛號决序提前通話。如此辦理，發話人如因要事急欲與對方談話者，可免久待之煩也。</p>
<p>關於長途電話之銷號及退費，略述如次：</p>
<p>（甲）經發話局處呌通受話局處，並已由受話局處接至受話人之話機，而受話人人因故不接話，未與發話人對講者，其情形與已經呌通受話局並已由受話局派差傳知，惟因受話人住址不詳無從傳達，或經傳達後受話人不來接話者相同，應由收費之電局，扣除一决通話費之三分之一，其餘話費仍應退還發話人。但受話人如因所裝話機或巿內話綫臨時發生障碍，或其他相同情形不能接話，經受話局查明屬實者，發話人所繳話費，應由電局悉數退還。</p>
<p>（乙）近來交通部爲優待用戶起見，特規定凡用戶已向電局掛號並繳付一次普通通話費，而在四小時以內，或已向電局掛號並繳付一次加急通話費，而在二小時以內，尙未與對方通話者，不論原因何在，如用戶不願再行守候，可向電局聲請免費銷號。所繳話費及附帶各費，並可由電局如數照退，不扣任何費用。</p>
<p>（丙）甲地電局登記之長途用戶，已向電局掛號欲與乙地某號電話通話，適乙地某號電話，亦已預先在乙地電局掛號欲與甲地該戶通話，比及接通後，甲地用戶因已與乙地某號電話通話而請求取銷頃間所掛之號者，如經查明該决通話，實係依據乙地某號電話用戶，在乙地電局所掛之號呌接，而甲地電局尙未將甲地用戶所掛之號呌通乙地電局記錄者，可照免費銷號辦法辦理。倘該次通話雖係依據乙地用戶在乙地電局所掛之號呌接，但甲地用戶所掛之號已經甲地電局呌通乙地電局記錄者，甲地用戶所請取銷掛號一節，應按發話人臨時請求撤銷通話例繳納一次通話費之三分之一，卽在預繳之話費內扣除之。</p>
<p>通話之種類有下列四種，說明如次：</p>
<p>（甲）普通通話發話　人如祇欲與某處某號電話通話，並未指定受話人姓名者，例如南京市內電話（三一七二八）號。此項通話祇認號數不認人，一經與所呌之某號電話接通，不論對方任何入前來接話，應卽自接話之時起計算通話時間並照普通通話價目收取話費。</p>
<p>（乙）加急通話　發話人如不欲依照普通掛號决序守侯通話者，可向電局聲請登記加急通話並照普通通話規定價目加倍付費，卽能獲得提前通話之優先權也。</p>
<p>（丙）傳呼通話　受話人尙未裝有市內電話者，適用此項通話。例如上海發話人文志仁欲與南京樓子巷一號馬履恒通話者，得向電局聲請登記傳呼通話。除照章繳付話費外，並應加付專力費一角。上項通話，應由受話局派人傳知受話人至受話局或公用電話處聽話。但傳呼範圍以離局五公里爲限。又傳呼通話得由發話人預的對方受話人在某一時間通話。發話人如使用該項預的辦法　除照付話費及專力費外，應加付普通話費之三分之一爲預的費。發話人於取得收據及知照通話處司機人傳出預的通知後，卽可離局他往。俟預的鐘點將屆，再往通話處通話。</p>
<p>（丁）預告通知　倘發話人於所呌對方電話號數之外，並欲與指定之人通話者，例如南京電話（31131）號分機（258）號孫粹英。此項通話旣係預告通知，應由發話人於話費之外，加付一次普通通話費之三分之一。</p>
<p>長途電話用戶對於上述各項，如能透澈明瞭，則使用時决無不便之處。</p>

<h3>談談發報人時常忽略的事（續）</h3>
<p>— 韋立</p>
<p>特官電印紙勿拍個人私事</p>
<p>查修正官軍電報收費，及限制辦法第十一條規定：電文不得涉及私事，局台倘發現電文內容涉及私事者，卽將電報扣留，並將電底檢呈交通部核辦。嘗見有發報人，持用官電印紙，要求拍發私事電報情事。希圖省費，固是人之常情。但能持用官電印紙之人，並非不能付給電費，或者以爲持用此紙以爲榮耀耶？不知涉及私事，有違定章，電報卽被扣留，希圖省費，延誤要事，自誤誤人，莫此爲甚！夫電報爲國營事業，持用官電印紙拍發私事電報，無異妨害國家收入。日前報載南京有某外籍女土，因屢决用友人所膾免票乘車，自知不當，卽將屢决車費的二百餘元，送交財部轉還鐵部。此種公德，値得吾人稱讚。持用官電印紙拍發私事電報者對之，當亦有所警惕歟。</p>
<p>其他</p>
<p>拍發尋常私務密語電報，除電文密語自譯外，其他收報人姓名住址，和署名等，祇書文字，須代譯字碼者，應按字收取譯費。惟收報人姓名住址，以計費字數爲準，譬如收報人姓名往址不逾十　字，收取譯費三分。倘然發報人自譯者，明語都須加注文字，以便收電員計算電費，校對字碼。</p>
<p>私務電報，分尋常加急二種。加急電照尋常加倍收費。此外別無「萬急」，「火急」，「特急」，「飛急」等字樣。前在軍閥時代，時有在官電印紙上濫加上項奇怪名目。現時官電中，亦僅有「急」，「特急」，兩種納費標識。在普通私務電報，除「加急」納費標識之外，其他都不適用。發報人要拍加急電報，可在報底上另註「加急」字樣，請勿寫在電文內。以免誤會。</p>
<p>拍發私務密語電報，不得將收報姓名住址，譯成密碼，使電局無法投送。密語官電之署名，亦不得用密碼書寫。有違「修正官軍電報收費及限制辦法」第二條之規定。</p>
<h3>電信珍聞</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>罪犯與無綫電</p>
<p>無綫電在目前不僅爲交通之利器，實爲發揚文化陶養性情之工具。在歐洲方面，已成爲罪犯之良好娛樂。德國之高等罪犯，准許每日收聽。捷克斯拉夫之罪犯，准聽音樂及一部份敎育節目，瑞士則將收音機設於監獄之走廊，使各罪犯皆能欣賞其節目。比利時監獄內皆設有耳機，使罪犯可以收聽指定之節目。丹麥則短期監禁之罪犯，准聽無錢電之播音。美國各監獄內，亦設耳機，並組織一犯人廣播團，每星期播音一次云。</p>
<p>保護飛機之小型無綫電</p>
<p>英國海港近裝設一極小無綫電，所用之電力極少，較之囊中所用之手電電力允微。爲保護駛行英法間之飛機而設。此機裝有長十呎之鋁質反射器，音波之集聚，有如光錢，直通於兩海岸，一在法國之聖印格維地方，一在英國之萊波地方，相距有三十五哩。每値飛機高翔其上，立卽用無錢電報告兩站，如機身發生障礙，機師急須降落水面，各站得訊，卽可馳援。</p>
<h3>問答欄</h3>
<p>本刋特爲問答一欄，社會人士，對於電報電話收發手續，及對於電信章程不明瞭之處，或對於電信常識有所垂詢時，本刋表示歡迎，具情奉答。</p>
<p>一，上海華起凡君問華文電報內之括弧，有計費者，有免費者，頗難記憶，有何簡便方法？請示知。</p>
<p>（答）左列一表，均係免費，此外均應計費。僅記此表足矣。</p>
<p>二，靑島劉志成君問左列一電，成如何計費？</p>
<p>（答）全電應照密碼價目收費。內中兩個括弧，亦須計費，且要收一部分譯費（四分）。</p>
<p>三，武昌李自淸君問巿內電話用戶租費，爲何分爲甲，乙，丙，丁四類？對於用戶，有何影響？</p>
<p>（答）爲公平用戶負担起見，故應分類收費，對於用戶有種　害。其詳細理由，請看本期「電話用戶分類問題之研究」一文。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （茸餘）</p>
<p>聽人聚談別人的短處，自己也會興高彩烈地附和。要是逢到人在譽揚別人，心中總覺得十分地不快。這種偏狹和自私的心理，要是能够打破，便是天下第一個公正人。</p>
<p>在現今的社會裏，交朋友談不到「義氣」二字，只要能够在背後「互捧」而不「互訐」，已經不是一件容易的事。</p>
<p>小孩子哭是眞哭，笑也眞笑。到了成人時期。哭笑非眞，面目全假。「智識」和「閱歷」，畢竟也是一件敎人犯罪作惡的東西。</p>
<p>一個人到了法律所不能制裁，禮節所不能拘東的地方，無論上智下愚，一般和禽獸無異。</p>
<p>環境惡劣而遽萌死志，果然不是一件勇敢的事情。不過也有許多人不能堅守貞操，自甘墮落。兩兩相較，畢竟還是前者較有價値。</p>
<h3>二面人</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>敝同居之中，有一位凍老爺，今年已是望六的人了，人是那麽的道貌岸然，眞有非禮勿言，非禮勿視的嘴臉。平日對於我輩年靑人，說起話來，更是一臉的正經。年靑入有時喝了幾口酒，或是打了幾圈牌，或是和年靑的大姑娘，說了一句二句玩話兒，那凖會受他大半天的隔壁敎訓。</p>
<p>年靑人無緣無故的受他的敎訓，自然誰都是不免於要　些兒那個的，但是他的理長，而且他還愛說「我並不是愛管閒事，像你這麽一個有作爲的靑年，幹這種事，我總覺有些可惜，所以我不由的不多說幾句。」自然，任誰給他把這麽個大帽子一戴，除了紅着臉，一疊聲的「是是是」之外，還有甚麽話好說呢？因此，我們那一屋子裏的靑年，偶而逢塲作戲一下子，雖然在老婆而前，倒也儘可不用瞞得的，在陳老頭子面前，却都火燭小心的，絕對不敢露一些兒風。</p>
<p>在某一天，我去訪一位朋友，從隔室傳出來的酒香肉香之中，猛然的聽得一陣十分諳熟的狂笑聲，可是一時記不起是誰。於是從門隙中窺視了一下，那可是活該，笑得張大了嘴；還沒閉攏的，正是那位正經人陳老爺。臉是紅得像染上了猪血，衣領兒是暢開着，比了我輩年靑人更失態。據朋友告訴我，這位陳老頭兒，和我那朋友的父親，是常在一塊兒玩的。喝酒，不用說了，打牌，可一口氣三十二圈。某一决，我那朋友還見他把一個從窰子裏呌出來的姑娘，耍得淌着眼淚咧。據說，這陳老頭兒，是他們幾個上年紀的老輩之中的最會玩的一個呢。</p>
<p>這眞是一位二面人，眞可說得見人說人話，見鬼說鬼話。我自從發現了他的秘密之後，屢决的想說穿他，但回頭一想，還是放忠厚些兒，讓他去裝模作樣罷。不過從那一回之後，我再見他放着一　正經，向我說法時，我肚裏只覺得這未免是滑天下之大稽。</p>
<h3>黃老頭兒</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>不見黃老頭兒，已經有二三個年頭了。最近，突然的，在一家熟識的商誧中，很巧的又遇見了他，頓時使我對於這位奇怪的黃老頭兒，發生了許多的回憶。</p>
<p>說起這位黃老頭兒，凡是認識他的，誰都認爲是一個特別的人。他今年已有四十八歲了　可是，單單調調的還是過着獨身的生活，雖然有人給他做媒，希望他成功一家人家，但是他終是不情願，時常說：「女人有什麼用呢？我最恨的就是女人；兒子要他做什麼呢？我自己的錢，難道自己不會化，定耍女人和兒子，來幫我消費嗎？」一般的人，見他個性特別，所以近來也沒有人和他提起做媒的話了！不過，背後總是議論紛紛的說：黃老頭兒是一個少見的怪人。</p>
<p>黃老頭兒除了不要女人之外，還有一件奇怪的事情，値得在這裏寫一寫的：就是他頭上的辮子，誓死也不肯剪去，假如有人要勸他剪去辮子的話，黃老頭兒就要搖頭擺尾，大哼其「身體髮膚，受之父母，不可毀傷。我怎樣可以把父母傳給我的頭髮剪去呢？」所以，直到現在，黃老頭兒的這條尾已，已有二尺多長了！看見的人，總要對他笑。可是黃老頭兒倒也一些不在意，仍舊笑嘻嘻的和人敷衍，不過，最近他爲了留辮子的人，在鄉村中只有他一人了，所以也把辮子盤了起來，用帽子遮蓋着，這或許也是黃老頭兒識相的地方。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飲恨千秋</p>
<p>我聽到他說得道樣的鄭重其事，便道：蘭兄，你待朋友，太過於忠實了，這件事，也許同你有相當的關係吧？要不然，你何必這樣的關切？蘭厂對這句話，並不答復，只是微笑的吸烟。我看了這種情形，便覺得這裏面有很多的奧妙，機會是不可失掉的，我就慨然的答說：好的只要你的定一個日子，我一定去。好在上海到蘇州，一天打來回，那是很從容的事。他見我答應了，好像有一件很重大的事，辦到了如願以償，只看他滿臉透出笑容來。我就重復答應了一句說：的定日子，我一凖到，你可以相信我爲人，决不隨便在朋友面前失信的。他那臉上笑容，兀自未曾收起，就在這時候，放下他手上的烟捲，把他放在椅子上的大皮包，打了開來，立刻取出一封有仿古石印圖案，長式的宣紙信柬，雙手遞給我，笑說：就是這禮拜日，前重陽兩天，正午一時，在蘇州舍下候光。我覺得他預藏了請帖在皮包裏，對於我這個客，是實實在在要請的，我眞不應常辜負了好友的一番深心。所以在我們談話的後三天，我就由上海北站，坐了早車到蘇州去。正趕上細雨之後的一個晴天，出門的人，很可以感到精神上一種鬆爽。蘭厂的家，在公園過去的一條深巷裹。沿着石砌的人行道，列着一排銀灰色粉墻。半環形的門上，列有一塊白石題額，那是集得黃石谷的叫個字幽蘭小築。在這一點上，便可以知道主人翁是處處留心的。不曾進門去，早是看到墻頭上那一叢翠竹，迎風招展，好像在那裏告訴着人，這裏面是很幽雅的。進得門去，並不像蘇州普通有花園的人家，閃出一條極無味的備弄。這裏是整整齊齊的一列山礬和一列扁柏，梢頭都修剪得平平的，排立在一條曲徑旁邊，通到一所花圃中去，不必走到近處，遠遠地就可以看到深黃淺紫，正把大叢的菊花，分散在綠樹淺草之中。這未曾到得園干裹去，就讓人先高典一陣，知道這位主人翁，心中是有邱壑的。正打量着呢，蘭厂早是紅着臉，額頭上帶了汗珠子，笑着迎了出來。老遠的就伸出手來，和我握着，笑說：我兄眞是信人。我也笑說：對於我兄，豈敢失信？他笑携着我的手，順了一條鵝卵右的小徑，再穿進一排方格花籬，便是蘭厂的家了。（三）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （謝澐）</p>
<p>每當放步到車站的時候，常常看見一羣一羣的黃牛從火車中牽到地上，也許因爲饑餓過度的原因，身子都很消瘦，牽出來的時候，也因爲站立太久，有時不能够踏過木板走到地上去，趕牛的人，就拿着鞭子連連的抽打，這可憐的畜生，只好掙扎着全身的力量，口中嘶着一二聲暗啞的鳴聲，踏下地來，有的　倒在地上，許久不能站起來，好不費氣力，從車上趕　這一羣黃牛，又慢慢的把牠們連成三只一隊，驅着向屠場去，我眼看着這一羣黃牛蹣跚的在馬路上，　人牽着鼻子去受屠宰！</p>
<p>和車站上的職員談談，他也不禁連連的教氣，農村破產，農人無法營生，只好把他們第二生命的牛來低價出賣，暫時解决生活，以後的耕種收穫，是不期望了，却不料農村破產，這可憐的畜生，也連帶受殃呢！我望着這一羣消失在馬路上的黃牛的影子，不禁深深地歎了一口氣！</p>
<h3>野火</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>這「野火」兩字，看去像非常俗氣的字眼；其實倘若溯起一個源頭來，到還在唐人的詩家口裏，就是一野火燒不盡，春風吹又生」這兩句，你想想，不是有很遠的來歷麽？閒話休講，姑且把近來吾們嘉定這一回「燒野火」的事，說給閱者們聽聽。</p>
<p>似乎這種風氣，向來是有的吧！到了現在，還終不免，就算在城圈子裏面，不在鄉村當中，也會得拿一片荒凉寂寞的草地，燒得像焦土一般，這實在是很可怖的一件事；起火的地方，而且就在城隍廟的後面，也在某校離開不遠的塲所，前幾天，竟不知不覺的燒得火如燎原，彌望一黑，聽說：是那一個丟下的火種？那末，自然總是有幾個頑童，不曉得有什麽利害，但逞我一時的好白相，管他燒到人家的死人身上呢？</p>
<p>哼！燒了好久，天氣雖然是寒冷，而火勢趁着東北風的權威，益覺來得猛烈，所以荒地上有某姓浮厝的兩具棺木，也就燒得像黑炭差不多；並且初起還沒有人覺察，直到行路的人遠遠地望見，方纔知道惹出這禍端來了。因爲浮厝的棺木，上而和周圍，必定拿稻草遮蓋，最容易引火，如用磚瓦來圍砌，那就好多了。但貧戶無錢的家主，那能顧到有這一天呢！</p>
<p>後來鬧穿了，被燒的某姓，那裏肯過去，據說：幾個放野火的孩子的父母，賠了幾塊錢，方得罷休；不曉得確不確？有某童在火燒得熊熊的當兒，看得正起勁，忽覺像冷水一樣，替他澆在背上，於是當夜就發起熱來，不到幾天，雖千方百計的醫治，終於不救。唉！這種事眞使不得的，有敎育兒童的先生們，吾望平日要講些出來，給他們聽聽纔是。</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>貴溪天師府與上清宮</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>前月十五日，浙贛路當局在南昌舉行玉南段通車典禮，余旣代表友聲旅行團，前往參加，三宿豫章，亦已飽覽彼邦風物。十八日復獨返貴溪之鷹潭，取道上清。一探道陵勝蹟。應淸有公路可通，以汽車行，僅一小時足；惜當積雪初融，不任飛輪，乃改乘羊角車往。叫十五里間，人烟荒凉，眞有屋少禂多之感！更七里，爲龍馬埠，上淸鎭之市梢也，有民團檢查綦嚴，碉堡四扼，數百人殆莫能犯。餐决，備述風土勝蹟，可喜可愕，凝聽迄夜午不倦。旣寢，藉草枕茅，體轉奇溫，聞四野犬聲如潮，則復私悸；燈綠如豆，烽紅逼霞，主人言當年赤禍亟時，正若是情景也。轉輾作念，天己破曉，時鎭上漸聞人語，急速夥伴之出。沿溪而束，九龍山向（土名）蜿延不絕，水氣上浮，束山腰如素霓，晨曦盪之，由微紫化爲純綠，迄於曠净。於是數十里內怪偉淸古諸秘，悉無遁匿。稍前，即天師府，巨厦面溪，甬道如矢，淸虛之境，其嚴肅過似官衙。自頭門達於內軒，歷廳凡四，計步三百七十有三，匾額錯懸，煌麗如昔。在第二進甬道上，有石井一，傳謂天師舊囚妖處，汲水敷肌，盛暑不生痱，導者言之鑿鑿，弗敢信也。入金光門，折至天師燕憇處，花草滿砌，一老嫗方司掃除；堊壁丹楹，盛張書繪，淸福中人，誠解事哉。惟旁窺內室，繩床吐草，鳧為穿底，仍難掩劫後衰落之象。西向爲　符室，中額「道德隆崇」，兩廡絕廣，聞民初求籙，猶日疊趾於庭；今則符價虛設，闃無問津者，盛衰如此，寗徒個中人爲之欷歔無盡！再啟西扉，爲萬法衆壇，古柏四幹，掩照中庭數百雷神像，陰森不耐久佇。當府未遭匪劫以前，門有守，室有司；不竭誠，無從進；不獻贄，末由見；而縉紳巨賈，仍不惜紆以相求，孰謂三四年後，荒　一至此哉！</p>
<p>出天師府，循溪東行，沙石漸露，水聲亦漸厲；載聽載步，以達上淸宮。亂峯作勢奔凑，不復可進。崒然秀於東者爲象山，宋陸金谿先生講學處焉；而台山鎭於北，若欲起而相犯者；南望聖井山脈，複嶺疊巘，更隱隱莫窮所止。趨入宮門，邃如穹道，砌石環洞，建樂特異。經下馬亭以至石闕，垣堵猶完好如初。再進，則蒿萊沒膝，舊傳三殿二十四院者，無復一　矣。聞十八年毛匪澤東盤踞上淸時，首焚宮，繼乃拷比各院法官之私蓄，受禍之烈，洪楊所未有。巡視廢基，碑礎而外，僅鏑樓堪資憑吊。問鐃鼓符劍設施之場，莽莽可悲耳！鐘鑄於漢末，多金質，劫後，某國人曾以十萬金相求，主事者却之，故今嚴加鑰，防外移也。其左百餘步，幸存於劫火者，猶有東隱院，現爲道人曾惟一所居。古樹虛欞，藉以栖密藏幽，殆是間之魯靈光也。院供道陵像，範銅髹藍，奉若天神；據惟一告：當赤氛熾時，亂民會劫置貴溪溷中，前歲始迎回院。蓋亦飽經滄桑之變矣。出觀元碑，兀立道左，皆高逾三伋；一爲虞集撰文，松雪書額，遒媚似出北海手。其一，已漶漫剝蝕，中僅「命臣集爲之文，而臣病伏田里。」十附字猶可辨讀；蓋亦係道園之筆，不識書者某氏，爲可恨耳。吾謂上淸之勝，以溪以山，使無有淸虛之宮，宗傳之寄，已自可喜；而况一金一石，又皆爲千百年前之所遺，因而撫玩，以覘其微，何啻叩伊闕以探奇，搜殷墟而窮變哉？因揭此文，以告國人。</p>

<h3>中學敎科書　須「注重作業」</h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>敎育部爲準備修訂現行課程標凖起見，會經於上月邀集各科專家及出版家代表開過幾决會議，同時並且公布了幾條改進中學敎科書編輯的要點，指示敎科書的內容須：切合敎育宗旨及修正的課程標凖，注重培養民族精神與實用能力，支配均衡適當無重複矛盾之弊，叙述正確文字淸順，注重作業……等項。其中或有關敎材的擇別，或涉及敎材的處理，對於整個敎育宗旨的貫澈以至課室內實際施敎效率的增進，關係都很重大，此後敎科書果能以上列各項爲標準去編輯，於我國敎育上必有良好的影響發生，是沒有疑義的。在這里作者要就其中「注重作業」一項來加以申述。</p>
<p>我國現代新式敎育，發軔於淸同治元年（公元一八六二年）總理衙門的奏請淸廷在北京設立同文館，此後所訂「新學」書籍即應時勢的需要而產生，以刊布新學書籍爲職志的出版家，也像雨後春筍一般蓬勃興起。戊戍政變之後，學堂制度確立，科舉制度廢除，正式的敎科書便隨着大量出現。但從當時起到民國七，八年間止，歷時近二十年，雖然經過朝代遞遭，國體政體改革等大變動，就學校敎科用書的編輯方法一點來看，却並未見有本質的變化。直到民國八年五四運動以後，美國杜威一派所倡導的所謂「新敎育」傳入，纔引起我國敎育界的注意。在「兒童本位」的新原理之下，新學制系統改革令公布了，課程綱要經敎部通函全國試行了，「敎授法」這一個名稱也經陶知行氏的倡議而改爲「敎學法」了。於是小學敎科書也受時代潮流的激盪而換了一副新面目。自此以後一直到現在，小學敎科書的敎材的內容和組織多能從兒童本位的觀點出發，處處顧到兒童的身心發展狀况，除正文以外，無不附列「問題」和「作業」等欄，藉以刺激或引導兒童自己去作思考，觀察，實騐，實行等活動，這可說是兒童本位敎育理論傳入我國以後的最具體，實惠的收獲，也就是我國現代敎育上的一大進步。可是小學敎科書雖已經過了這樣重大的有意義的變革，中學課本却依然還保持原有的狀態，民國十八年暫行課程標準頒行以後，標準中除羅列敎材大綱之外也有「作業綱要」的規定，於是有若干依據新標凖編成的課本，於正文之外，居然附列了「作業」或「習題」等項目，可是一考他的內容大抵以提問課本內容爲限，除便於學生複習這一點以外，再沒有別的意義了，這不能不說是一種缺憾。這决敎育部特地把「注重作業」列舉中學敎科書應行改進要點之一，自然是有爲而發的。作者深望此後的出版家和編輯者能切實對這一面加以注意纔行。</p>
<p>編者按：敎課用書中編列作業指導，敎育作用重大，早爲敎育者所公認。開明書店所刊行小學課本，對於道一方面向極注意，如高級小學適用的自然課本和社會課本兩書允爲詳備，採用者無不稱便。至於中學課本方面，正在送審中的新課程國文，公民，動物學，植物學，本國地理等敎本，都列有「作業要項」一欄，藉以輔導學生從事各種活動以助記憶，思考，應用，對於中學敎育或有若干之貢獻。</p>

<h3>關於「平屋雜文」</h3>
<p>— 佩弦</p>
<p>丐尊兄：</p>
<p>上回承寄「平屋雜文」，感感！最喜歡的是怯弱者·貓·長閑等篇，命相家·灶君與財神·誤用的並存和折中·知識階級的運命·我的中學生時代·光復雜憶·緊張氣分的回憶·中年人的寂寞·早老者的懺悔·致文學靑年，也都很有意思。我說「有意思」，有兩個意思：一是有幽默，雖然幽默下藏着悲哀。二是文字親切的同感。如少年時的回憶，中年時的惆悵。這惆悵在我看，也是一種愉快；其實這惆悵也是必然。——我的話未免有些阿Q相吧！說理的文字自然也是經騐之談，但嫌短些。</p>
<p>序裏說起吉子，想不到這麽小的年紀竟去了，追憶白馬湖看她兒時的情景，令人難以爲懷。兄只寥寥數語，實蘊深悲。這也是中年人的苦惱吧。　弟朱自淸</p>

<h3>讀中學生雜誌的　「研究和體騐」特輯</h3>
<p>— 余哲剛</p>
<p>記得有一次讀到法國文學家紀德說：「我讀着某本書，讀完後我把它闔起來；我把它置在書架那一格上。……儘管我忘却讀到這句話的書；儘管我速讀過這句話也肥憶不淸；儘管我只能糢糊的記起這句話。……不相干！我可不能够重新變成未續此語之前的『我』了。……」那時我只覺得這一段話是非常的美，非常的可愛。然而也僅僅是限於這個「美」，這個「可愛」罷了。那知在今天——在我讀完了本年一月號中學生「研究和體騐」特輯的今天以後，這一本普通裝訂的書，牠的軀壳雖是躺在那桌上，明明是躺在那里。呵！牠却無時無地不是糾纏着我，再也拂牠不開。這使我不能不對於那個法國人生出無限的敬意。</p>
<p>我得說：「太感動，太親切的文章就是太了解，太眞誠的諍友。」這簡直是逼得我顧不了我的文章的醜陋，就大膽來「感想」一下。道「感想」，不過是想「感」了之後，讓我安靜一下。——也可以說，讓我對於這些研究過同體騐過的「老」靑年們表示無限的敬意吧了。</p>
<p>在中學里的時候，常常聽到同學說：「這門功課太乾燥無味，眞懶得去讀牠」！「這枯燥的東西讀牠有甚麼用處？」就是陳衡哲先生在救救中學生一文里也認爲「枯燥而艱深的數學」應當减少敎學時間。這種主張至少是患着短視的毛病。像數學·理化·文法同歷史在大部分的中學生眼里看來是應歸到「乾燥無味」，「無大用處」的科目里去吧。這樣，就請靜靜地躺下來，讓「我對於算學的趣味」，「我願意我是一個數學家」，「文法因緣」同「歷史學的新途徑」四位醫師來診治診治。還有曾廣方先生的一篇化學實騐室的十五年裏所含着的研究態度和苦學精神，至少可以給一般想「開快車」的急性同學們打一下淸血針。</p>
<p>紅着臉說：我過去曾熱心看一些甚麼文章作法和如何寫作一類偷巧的書，——迷信牠會引我走上寫作之路，結果，巧沒有偷到，而自己却上了大當。現在，我明白了：即使把道類東西死啃一輩子，一輩子也不會得到些甚麼益處；掉一句話：一輩子也不會寫出一篇像樣的東西。中學生中間大概不少這種例子吧，那我就得勸您去讀張天翼先生的學習的學習。這篇文字眞算做到「極其切實的指示，敎給我們怎樣去學習」的工夫。尤其是作者的親切熊度眞像一個聰穎的哥哥，滿臉笑意，不厭求詳地去告訴他的不大懂事的弟弟似的。</p>
<p>茅盾先生的談我的研究雖是一篇僅佔四頁的短文，所談的却多很重要。他說：「寫小說的人倘使除了研究『人』而外還有什麽應得研究的，就是前人的名著，以及累代相傳的民間小說。」又說：「一個人開始新寫一篇的時候，最好能把他的舊作統統忘記，最好是每决都像是第一决動筆，努力把『已成的我』勢力擺脫」。這對於初學寫作的中學生們是多麽精當而赤誠的指導呵！此外像朱光潛先生的談讀詩與趣味的培養，鄭振鐸先生的關於版書和盧冀野先生的「曲海浮生」都是値得一讀的關於「文藝修養」的好文章。</p>
<p>不久以前，常常有人問起我中學畢業後志願怎樣，我總是瞠目不知所對；在中學生諸君中與我同病的一定不少，我敢信！道緣由仔細分析起來，不外因爲高中「不分科」的害處所致，這害處使我們的興趣多元化，或變成了純粹的工具主義而無所謂興趣。這在袁牧之先生的興趣·志願·生活里，極透澈地開導了我們。要使自己的志願堅定，務須經過興趣的階段，在這階段里「具體地對自己的能力有客觀的認識」是不可忽視的。然後再將道經興趣洗鍊過的志願與生活作有機的連繫，這樣的生活纔可以說是合理的。說得明白些，興趣·志願·生活必須統一。還有：「如若等中學畢業後再辨別自己的興趣和志願，則似乎太遲而容易走上岐途，反之，在中等敎育尙未完成就决定自己的興趣和志願，則叉似乎太早，也容易走上岐途。」不安求學的靑年們，應該細味這兩句話的含義。</p>
<p>普通一般的心理：中學畢業以後不能升學是件不幸的事，「就業」是樁不得已的事。誠然，在一個合理的社會制度之下，這是不容吾認的事實。但在我國的現社會里，這種心理是犯了極大的錯誤。倘若想平心靜氣在大學里研習學術，那不是「中國目前的事」；要呢，除非先投身社會，找出現社會制度的不合理的病源來，以革命的手段去診斷牠。所以輕視「就業」是靑年們極不應該有的病態心理，允其是中學生。如果有人以爲就了業馬上會同學術絕了緣，那末，畢雲程同胡仲持兩位先生的經歷是很合適的辯護者了。於是，我的研究興味和記者生涯對於徘徊在「升學」與「就業」的岐途上的中學生們是値得細心一讀的。</p>
<p>章乃器先生的我的研究動機和研究經歷給了一些不了解生活眞意的靑年們一個有力的啓示：「靑年們不要做爲生活而生活的人，也不要做爲研究而研究的人，更不要做因不滿生活而不願研究的人。我們爲了大衆的利益，爲了歷史的使命，我們不能不研究。」這更可以堅定我們的意志了。</p>
<p>談到體育的不被重視，幾乎成了中等學校經常的病態。讀了金仲華先生那篇我曾經想做一個體育家以後，那些爲分數而讀死書的「文質彬彬」的中學生們，能對運動引起熱烈的愛好吧。我深深地希望着。</p>
<p>就是這樣草草地檢討一下，可說中學生雜誌的「研究和體騐」特輯的內容是够滿意的。但是，讀後總覺不够飽似的。好像編輯後記里也說過：有幾位專家本已答應我們寫文章了。可是實在忙不過來，到這期付印的時候還沒有動手。」當然我也要同編者一樣：「希望他們以後多寫文章交來」，塡塡我們的尙感不十分滿足的胃部吧！</p>
<p>總之，讀了道些文章以後，在學習上修養上可以得到種種啓發，是誰也不能抹煞的。</p>

<h3>從「文無定法」談起</h3>
<p>— 王天休</p>
<p>有時候我們談到文章作法一類問題，覺得問題是太錯綜複雜了，一時談不了許多，我們往往感慨似地用「文無定法」這句話去作結論。其實這句話未免太寵統一點，而且是不十分正確的。中文的繁複·艱深·難於在短時間內學習得純熟，這是事實，無庸否認。但是我們便因此說牠沒有一定的法則可循，那就近乎寃屈了牠。</p>
<p>構成一篇文童有兩種要素，那就是通常所謂「形式」和「內容」。體裁·結構·用詞·造句·修辭以及風格等，是屬於文章的形式這一面；文中所記載的事物和事理·所杼寫的情感和思想，道是文章的內容。</p>
<p>我覺得文章的內容方面，作者的主觀色彩總是很濃厚的。一百個人對同一題目寫文章，就有一百種不同的內容。因爲一般人的思想和情感，往往因客觀環境（例如年齡·性別·職業·經濟狀况·學識經騐等）不同而產生種種獨特的形熊；各人思想情感的形態旣各有特點，當然對於同樣一種事物的看法也不同，也就會寫成絕不相同的文章了。所以就文章的內容方面說，要揭出某幾條富有「科學性」的法則來，原也難能，而且事實上也並不需要如此做去。可是文章的形式方面，就確有許多客觀具體的理法存在着，我們是不能用「文無定法」這句話去抹殺她的。譬如用詞有用的法則，造句有造句的法則，修辭結構有修辭結構的法則；其他如體截，如風格，也各有明顯的外形，各有類別性質與表現方法。這些，全可以運用科學的方法去分析·解剖而加以明確的解釋的。所以我以爲文章的內容，因各人主觀不同沒有定則可言，至於牠的外形，實在很有理法可循</p>
<p>「形式」是文章的一個重要某點，因爲沒有這「形式」，就無從表現「內容」。所以一個初學者，最好能多在文章的形式方面去下一番探討習練的工夫，使寫作的技術趨於合理化。至於文章內容的充實問題，當然也很重要，不過這决不是可以速成的事；須從學識·經騐·情操等多方面去找尋培植滿養的途徑，使牠慢慢地進步·豐盛，文章的內容自會跟着充實起來。</p>
<p>着眼於文章的形式運用科學方法來編輯的國語文讀本，坊問向來不大多見。最近我看到兩冊開明出版的「國文百八課』（全部共有六冊），覺得很滿意。這一部初中學生受課或自修用的國文讀本；同時也可以充作敎師用的敎本。牠的特點就在掃除一般人對國文玄妙籠統的觀念；使學習者除瞭解內容外，特別注意到使他們認識文章的外形，得到閱讀和寫作的正當方法。</p>
<p>這一套書採用分課混合的編制法。牠雖然也採納大量的選文，但不像普通的讀本那樣僅是機械地排列着一篇篇文章和零零星星的註釋。牠每課成爲一個學習單元，包括「文話」一則，「文選」兩篇，「文法」或「修辭」一則，「習問」若干題。「文話」在每課的開端，講述一般文章的理法。其决是「文選」，選材以「文話」爲中心，也可以說是「文話」的實例或證明。再决是「文法」或「修辭」，各按昭着固有的統系，很有程序地分配於各課「文選」之後，裏面所提舉的例證，全從「文選」中採取。「習題」在每課的最後部分，根據文話文法修辭的內容，設題去考騐學習者，使有複習的機會。</p>
<p>對於初中以下的學生，敎材形式上的「趣味性」是一種很重要的成分。像這部「國文百八課」能把作法理論與選文打成一片，夏丐尊葉紹鈞二先生的筆調又十分淸麗暢達，寫得娓娓動聽，我相信在學習者一面，一定會增加不少的興味。比起死讀講義和文選，漫無目的地摸索，或枯守着幾本文法和修辭學苦讀，眞是强得多了。</p>
<p>一個無力升學的小學畢業生，或是一個國文程度太低的在業者，要是他們能自覺地需要請人做他們的國文導師，或想利用業餘時間，下一番國文科的自修工夫，我想這部「國文百八課」倒也很够去担當這份責任，帮助他們去實現自己的夙願。</p>
<p>「國文百八課」是一部很精粹·很科學化的國本讀本，値得向大家推薦一下。可是，不知爲甚麼現在還祇出版了兩冊；很希望其餘四冊快快出版，使與世人相見。</p>

<h3>「童話與兒童的研究」</h3>
<p>— 蘅</p>
<p>「在日本的小學校裏，敎師對於文學敎材，不去完美地發揮牠本身的價値，却往往採用了理科講授與歷史講授那樣的方法，將牠授與兒寬。如其說敎師想使兒童享受文學的眞味，母寧說想用文學的敎材濫向兒童灌注科學知識和歷史知識……」</p>
<p>讀了上面的一段話，很令人感到中國的小孩子也未始不是這樣感受着。允其是在一反神仙故事的現在，兒童讀物，大概都注重在科學常識的一方面，站在成人的主觀立塲上向兒童灌注着我們以爲「有益」的材料。至於故事童話等，是一般地被排斥了，在兒童讀物的作者看來，故事，童話，僅僅是用來消遣的東西，是沒有實在的敎育價値的，可是這一重現象所會發生的結果，我們看松村武雄怎樣解釋他們的日本敎育吧，這也許可以並用來解釋我們中國的兒童敎育現象。</p>
<p>「我們的所謂敎育，與其說是敎育的意味，母寧說是敎養的意味。今日的所謂敎育，是以A訴諸知力，B缺乏有機的統一，C缺乏趣味為其特徵的，所以兒童雖然曉得了許多事實，但牠們並不完全成為他們心的糧食，並且各種知識，不是以渾然的統一去涵養他們的心性的，結果，兒童僅爲知識的重荷的壓迫所苦，而沒有用了愉快的心情來加以享樂的心的餘裕。」</p>
<p>給知識的重荷所苦，得不着適常的心性的涵養，我們有什麽法子可以抑制兒童不熱切地傾向於連環圖畫呢？兒童變幻想，愛新奇，愛追尋和探討，但是成人爲他們所特製的「有益」的讀物，却不能滿足他們的慾望，他們缺乏實際的經騐，所以不論在生活上或思想上，現實的背景都很稀薄，不論一株樹一張桌都能突然具了人格而活動起來。假如科學的眞理能隨了兒童的心性發展，以富於趣味和生勳的方式來引導他們入勝！收效將比只訴諸兒童的知力與記憶要來得大，情緒掀動是能比任何方法都深入的。給兒童的藥餌需要糖衣，給兒童的知識也需要有糖衣，怎樣把糖衣包裏在知識的外面呢？「童話與兒童的研究」一書也許能給與兒童的敎育者一點幫助。關於寫作的態度，上書的作者曾說了這麽的一段話，現在把牠引在這裏用作結末：</p>
<p>「制作童話的人對於兒童非懷有純眞的愛不可。對於兒童的全心的愛，正是賦與所作的童話以潑刺的生命的一大魔術。若是沒有這種純眞的愛，那麼，不論童話作者怎麽通曉文藝上的一切技巧，不論童話作者怎樣地在科學上理解兒童的心理，那作品也是沒有生命的東西，也是缺乏活動血肉的一種骸骨。」</p>

<h3>德國又將要求索還殖民地</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>不久以前，報傳希特勒擬於四月間舉行公民投票，以兩項問題付表决：　德國是否需要殖民地？　德國是吾應恢復萊茵區域武裝？不料這兩個問題尙未提出，第二問題已有答案。多年不駐兵的萊茵區域，又在　字旗下，受德國軍隊所統轄。現在德國爲實現第一問題起見，又將有所舉動了。</p>
<p>近日巴黎來電，謂自可靠方面得悉，德國現向歐洲各國，提議一種辦法，由各國貸欵與德國，俾德國能購回上西里西亞，米美爾，及波蘭走廊，或戰前德國在菲洲的殖民地。向各國借欵購回殖民地，希氏此舉，比派大軍進入萊茵區域和平得多了。聞這項建議，尙附有一種說明，謂此的若能成立，卽可消滅異日德國訴諸武力的行動。實在的，德國對於舊殖民地的要求，已甚迫切。這事倘無別種途徑可解决，以武力爭奪，是勢在必行的。</p>
<p>不過用金錢購回殖民地，辦法雖善，但實行恐不容易。因殖民地不是單純的經濟問題，關係於政治問題也很大。故德國這種提議，恐難獲得各國的同意。至少有利害衝突的國家，必表示反對。</p>
<p>就是德國是吾眞正願意這樣做，也還是疑問的。像上列幾處殖民地，本來是屬於德國的。現在德國要收回這些殖民地，須付一筆代價，這損失便不少了。故這决德國的建議，說不定只是他日收回殖民地的先聲。</p>
<p>又據另一消息，希氏主張將前屬德國的菲洲領土，重行分配，同時更主張於阿比西尼亞有一勢力區。看來德國此刻不但希望索還舊殖民地，且尙有要求新殖民地的意思、希氏曾說過，歐洲國家有殖民海外之權，德國現已十分强固，無需國聯援助，且無需條的，殖民地係以强權取得者。那末希氏所欲提出付公民表决的第一問題，也許不久就有答案了。</p>
<h3>瞎子</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>我們底家就在那一個姓崔的瞎子家隔壁。那是一座破落的院子，大門的油漆都已剝落了。只有掛在門旁的黑底金字的招牌，還輝煌地顯示着主人底身世，一種懷古意味的光彩。</p>
<p>在先，我跟別人一樣地走過去了，從沒有注意過。及至後來，和隣街發生密切的友誼的弟弟從別人嘴裏聽來一些關於當地的風俗習慣的故事，其中就有關於這個姓崔的瞎子的。</p>
<p>據說，崔瞎子很有名望，在當地的紳士們底眼裏，他簡直和諸葛亮一樣神明。他們不但是把平常的事拿來問，就是生活上的許多問題他們也來求敎他。比方今年的買賣怎麽樣，作那一方的好，只要崔瞎子說一聲，他們底可憐的命運就定下了。記得當我剛到地的時候，住在旅館裏，尋找一位親戚得不到地址的時侯，茶房就曾殷勤地說過：「找崔瞎子給你算算吧！」我不明白爲什麽他特別介紹這個姓崔的。問他時他才告訴我說道：</p>
<p>「先生，你不知道崔瞎子？眞怪，唉，有名咧……你是外省人，先生，……他，我就告訴你：當張長腿在這裏的時候，可就有本事啦，……那時也不知道是什麽軍來，反正是來打張長腿的，一打打到千佛山根下了，張長腿就要下令退却，誰知這時候有人介紹進個瞎子來，他進言說：—督辦，唉，那時候沒主席，還呌督辦，……他說：督辦不要驚慌，快些下令反攻；一定得勝，督辦還能坐一年哩……嚇，這一說不打緊；可把張長腿底小心打動了，於是下令反攻，一下子瞎子的話就靈了騐，喜的個張長腿只是笑，述忙把瞎子請進督辦公署，當軍師看待……那個瞎子就是崔瞎子。他底本領大咧，現在還收好多徒弟，敎給他們算卦的方法……你先生找他算一算吧……</p>
<p>我對這故事非常感到興味。雖然我拒絕了他底要求。我就打算找到這個瞎子談一談。因爲我曾聽人說過，一個盲人是多麼樣地成天沉思而變成哲人的話。後來，自己底事情忙起來了，對於這件事也就忘了，眞沒有想到會住在隔壁。當第二天我再走到那個門前的時候，就特別注意了。可是只有那塊牌子可以表示出他底籍貫和姓名以外，別的什磨也表示不出來，允共表示不出它底主人就是曾經富貴一時的崔瞎子。</p>
<p>第二天，我問弟弟他是不是見過他，什麽樣子的時侯，他告訴我可以隨便去找他，在一個下午，我同弟弟就到他家裏去。當時的心情，眞像一個沒有一點經騐的戀愛者，探訪他底情人一樣。</p>
<p>一進大門，就看到一個年紀在四十來歲的人，留着的短頭髮，已經發白，鬍鬚短短地也蒼老了。他是那樣悠悠自得的閒步着。身上穿的綫春夾袍，陽光照着他失明的睛珠，正好像向一個沒有飯吃的人誇耀財富一樣無恥。他並沒有感到陽光，到是耳朶很銳敏地聽到我們的腳步聲了。他用老年人底低音說：</p>
<p>「誰呀，裏面坐吧……那溫和的態度像一座石佛樣。「你是誰呵？」</p>
<p>我底弟弟也許和他熟了，一回答他，他就像見了老朋友似的親熱地「吆吆」着，伸出手來找尋弟弟底手，弟弟又把我介紹給他，當他握着我底手的時候，驚嘆地說：「好福氣，好福氣，有這樣好的弟兄們！」</p>
<p>他用手扶着弟弟底肩走進屋裏去，我也隨進來了。屋裏底陳設，像一個小康家庭，或者說是上等家庭，有許多珍貴的磁器，和漂亮的木器什麽的，不是一個小康之家能够辦到的。牆壁上掛着張長腿底照片，題着字，好些表彰這屋子主人底身份似的。它底主人呆着丰滿的臉，向我們解釋道：</p>
<p>「這些東西，都是張督辦留下的！」</p>
<p>當我們走出來的時侯，有四五個瞎子一齊走進來，聽說，那都是他收的徒弟。弟弟告訴我；「他是過着安安生生的日子，許多達官貴人們還時常用汽車來接他去算卦，一下就是好幾百！他底徒弟在社會上的勢力也很大！」</p>
<p>有時我走過他底門前，看到他底黑金字牌子的時侯，就想起來有機會可以問問他「這牌子底命運還有幾時呢？…」</p>
<h3>葉綠河上的歌聲</h3>
<p>— 米山</p>
<p>冬天一轉眼就過去了。隨著來的是春天。</p>
<p>春天對於我們並沒有什麽大不了的事。因爲我們底生活裏就無從去分別，無論是春也好，夏也好，我們全是在痛苦裏過日子。在以前的時侯，到處都是歡樂的歌聲，這隻船上的人們唱起來的時侯，那些無數的船隻上的人們也就和着。我們底歌都是紀念我們底死去的祖先的，每一隻歌說某一祖先底一段生活，這一段生活都是寳貴的經騐：我們把他當作功課一樣來學習。……來到現在，我們底生活苦起來了，那些歌子也好像跟着起了變化：它有些沉悶了。</p>
<p>今年春天，我們希望能夠像往日樣快活。</p>
<p>望着波濤的河水，我想起了一個祖</p>

<h3>Important Figures from China and Japan Gather in Tianjin to Discuss Joint Anti-Communism Efforts in Hebei and Chahar; Korean Representative, Zhang Lian, Participates in Discussions; Decision Reportedly Reached on the Hebei-East Issue; Song Zheyuan Expected to Return to Beiping Mid-Next Week</h3>
<p>Tianjin – Lu and Han (Korean) dispatched Councillor Zhang Liansheng to Tianjin to meet with Song and participate in the Hebei-Chahar anti-communist consultations convened by China and Japan. At 10:00 AM on the 31st, Chen Juesheng, Chen Zhongfu, and Shi Jingting went to the Japanese concession’s Furong Villa to visit Matsumuro, head of the special agency, and Yongjian, staff officer of the Tianjin garrison. Takeshita, head of the Yuguan special agency, was also present. They exchanged views on anti-communism for over two hours. Xiao Zhenying, Qin Decun, Chen Zhongfu, and Chen Juesheng hosted a banquet for Matsumuro at Bei Ning’s residence on Haihe Road at 7:00 PM on the 31st, inviting Tada, Yongjian, Ishii, Nakai, Otake, Takeshita, as well as Song Zheyuan, Shi Jingting, and Zhang Liansheng to accompany him. (31st Special Dispatch) China and Japan are exchanging views on the Hebei-Chahar anti-communist matter.</p>
<p>Beiping – At 2:00 PM on the 31st, a meeting was held at Zhang Yuan's commander's residence to continue the morning talks. Each matter was thoroughly discussed. The Japanese side was represented by Matsumuro, Yongjian, Takeshita, Ishii, and staff from the Tianjin garrison. The Chinese side was represented by Qin Decun, Xiao Zhenying, Chen Jueming, Chen Zhongfu, and Shi Jingting, Zhang Liansheng, and others. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. Zhu Zheyuan, Tada, Matsumuro, and Yongjian will meet again within days to decide everything. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – Sources report that Song hosted a banquet for Tada, Yongjian, Matsumuro, and others in Tianjin yesterday, explaining the Hebei-Chahar anti-communist issue. Matsumuro visited Song and Qin Xiao again today to exchange personal views. The Hebei-Chahar diplomacy, previously stalled due to communist bandits fleeing to Jin, has been restarted after repeated resolutions and explanations by the authorities. The Japanese side is now fully aware of the situation here, and negotiations are continuing. A decision has reportedly been reached on the Hebei-East issue and will be resolved soon.

<h3>Trial of Assassin of Wang Continues; Li, Xiang, and Lu All Cunningly Deny Involvement; Evidence Still Needs to Be Investigated; Resumption of Trial Scheduled</h3>
<p>Nanjing – The trial of the assassination case of former President Wang resumed at 1:00 PM on the 31st. The presiding judge, judges, prosecutor, clerk, and lawyers all arrived on time. The audience was still crowded. Chen Shuren, Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding, and others were also present for the hearing. After the court was announced, the three defendants, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguong, and Liu Shurong, were brought in and the transcripts of their testimonies from the 30th were read aloud. They made slight corrections and signed them. At 2:08 PM, Li Huaicheng was brought in for questioning. Li was an old and cunning criminal who claimed to know nothing about the assassination plot. He claimed that he went to the Chenguang Society because his old friend Xiang Zhonglin lived there, and he only found out that the society was a cover for an assassination agency after the incident. Although he was present at the meeting on the evening of October 28th, he was drunk and confused and did not know what everyone was talking about. He also blamed them for not having a clear understanding of Chairman Chiang and the current situation. He had not seen the pistol before. On October 30th, he saw Sun Fengming and said that Chairman Chiang was crucial, and whoever harmed Chiang would be responsible for the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race, and would become a traitor. Sun sincerely accepted this. He claimed that he was an anarchist who believed in the unity of mind and matter, based on an interpretation of Buddhist scriptures. He also denied that his residence was a secret communication agency. When the presiding judge confronted him with the fact that his son Zeng Po had admitted to forwarding letters from his residence and receiving subsidies from Hua Kezhi, he claimed to know nothing about it and had no contact with the Fujian rebels. At 3:15 PM, Xiang Zhonglin was brought in for questioning. He also cunningly denied everything. He claimed that he lived in the Chenguang Society because his life was unsettled and he had no idea about their plot. He introduced He Poguong to obtain the Central Party Department pass. The dozens of dollars he used at the Chenguang Society were due to friendship. He could not remember the conversation on the evening of October 28th because he was drunk. He moved out of the Chenguang Society on October 30th and went to Shanghai on the 31st. He moved to three hotels in Shanghai in two days for the convenience of visiting friends. He went to Fujian to seek a living and had nothing to do with the People's Government. He also denied that he had committed a kidnapping case in Shanghai and was sentenced to three years in prison there. At 3:55 PM, Lu Qingqi was brought in for questioning. Lu was a former lawyer and his cunning was even more polished. He claimed to know nothing about the Chenguang Society. They hid the pistol in his home, and he did not know it was a pistol beforehand. He also did not take on the job of informing Shanghai by telegram after the second assassination plot failed. Regarding the fifty dollars given by Zhang Yuhua, he initially admitted it, then claimed that the money was not used for escape. The presiding judge then ordered the lawyers to state their opinions on reviewing the case files. After that, he read out the confessions of the three defendants, Li, Xiang, and Lu. After signing the confessions, he announced that the case still required reviewing the files and investigating the evidence, and that the final debate could not be announced today. The resumption of the trial would be scheduled. The court adjourned at 5:50 PM, and the defendants were returned to custody. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing – Zhang Yuhua's initial confession in the police department, which was published in various newspapers on the 30th, has been recorded. The main points of Zhang's second confession in the police department on November 9th last year are as follows: Wang Yaqiao and Yu Zikui had no so-called political stance. Assassination was their profession. Their purpose was money. Whoever gave them money could kill for them. This assassination was allegedly that Wang Yaqiao, Yu Likui, Hua Kezhi and others received a total of 40,000 yuan from Chen and Li. We only received about 10,000 yuan from Wang and Yu. Hua Kezhi, Cai Daohe, Hu Dahai, Wang Renshan, etc. communicated with them and received money. We often traveled between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Wang used to specialize in colluding with hooligans and bandits in Shanghai to engage in kidnapping and assassination, so he was known as the Axe Gang. His subordinates included Hua Kezhi, Zhang Zhihan, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, Gong Chunchan, Cai Daohe, Xu Zhiyuan, etc. Before and after the "January 28th" incident, they set up an agency in Taoyuan Village on Lafayette Road, which lasted for a year before moving elsewhere. In the spring of the 23rd year, due to the discovery of the assassination of Song Ziwen, the government was in urgent pursuit, so they fled to Hong Kong. However, Wang and Yu were very bold and still secretly returned to Shanghai from time to time. He told us to do assassination work, completely based on the relationship of Jianghu brothers, and added enticement and threats. The bombs they used to assassinate Song were made by themselves. Xie Wenda rented two houses next to the pedestrian path at the North Railway Station beforehand to live in. Xie's servants, bomb handlers and pistols were all hidden there. After detecting Song's arrival in Shanghai, seven or eight of Wang's disciples carried out the assassination at the same time. Wang determined the plan and Yu Likui directed the operation on the spot. Part of the accomplices were Longtan soldiers, Xie Wenda's subordinates, and part were Wang's followers.

<p>Hong Kong – Four Chinese were arrested in Hong Kong in connection with the assassination of then-Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei in November last year. The Chinese government presented the confessions of two of the six people currently on trial at the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court as evidence and requested extradition for trial. The four defendants were interrogated yesterday by the presiding officer, Xu Feierte. The royal lawyer, Shirley Wright, declared that the assassination of Mr. Wang was carried out by conspirators colluding in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. A communication agency was established in Nanjing to conduct secret activities and gain access to Mr. Wang. Their intention was also to harm Chiang Kai-shek. These people were purely motivated by greed and had no other purpose. They belonged to the type of people who seek profit through violence. The four defendants hired a Chinese lawyer, Xin, for defense. Xin agreed that all those involved in the case should be tried at the same time. Further evidence is still needed, and the presiding officer has indefinitely postponed the trial. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Although fire trucks arrived to put out the fire, it was ineffective. The destroyed plane is still parked at the airport, and the airport has sent personnel to guard it and prohibit visits. The company's Beijing office has telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters to report the incident. Also, the plane was insured for fire by a certain company in Shanghai. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing – The Army 25th Division Headquarters recently telegraphed Nanjing to report the recent situation of bandit suppression in Shanxi. The original telegram is recorded below. Telegram 1: Mao, Peng, Xu, Lin, Ye, and other bandit leaders and their main forces of 5,000-6,000 people fled to the areas of Huoxian, Zhaocheng, and Hongdong in southern Shanxi.

<h3>Inspectors Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing – Inspectors of the Shanxi bandit suppression work, Zhang Huafu, Hou Cheng, etc., went to Shanxi to meet with Director Yan, etc., and inspected the front lines. They have completed all matters and returned to Nanjing to report to President Jiang everything. Zhang Huafu said that the bandits invaded Shanxi with great momentum. Thanks to the effective resistance of the Shanxi army, the local area was not ravaged. Then the Central Army rushed to the scene and took a semi-encirclement position. A general offensive was launched on all lines, killing thousands of bandits. The bandits suffered a huge setback, and their momentum was dampened. They then broke up into smaller groups and scattered to the countryside. Our army continued to pursue and suppress them in different ways. It is expected that they will be suppressed soon. Regarding the concerns of foreign embassies in China about the safety of foreign nationals in Shanxi, because the bandits in Shanxi are nomadic in nature and have not occupied important cities, foreign nationals in the territory are very safe and have not been injured. The rumor that foreign missionaries were captured seems to be unreliable. The authorities will do their best to protect foreign nationals in Shanxi. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Canceling Contracts for Using Marked Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, it has been clearly stipulated that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are legal tender. In addition, the banknotes issued by banks approved by the Ministry of Finance are limited to the total amount in circulation as of November 3rd of last year, and they are allowed to circulate as usual. The Ministry of Finance stipulates that they should be gradually exchanged for Central Bank banknotes within two years, and the statutory reserve funds for the total amount in circulation will be kept by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee. Contracts signed by various banks and firms with the aforementioned three banks to use exchange notes will also be limited to two years, and will not be continued after the expiration. As a result, some issuing and note-using banks, taking advantage of the fact that issuance is concentrated in the three banks, use the excuse of "special circumstances" to notify the various small money shops that use marked banknotes and demand the cancellation of the note-using contracts. The various money shops are unwilling to accept this, so they have jointly filed a complaint and requested that the original contracts be maintained. Among those that have had legal disputes and been reported in the newspapers, there have been many, such as Continental, China Industrial, China General Commercial, and Donglai. Although banks such as Continental and Donglai have settled their disputes separately through reconciliation, generally speaking, the note-using issue still needs to be fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>The nature of using marked banknotes can be divided into two categories from the perspective of bank status. One category is issuing banks, such as China Industrial Bank, China General Commercial Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, as well as the four-bank reserve pool jointly formed by the Salt Industry Bank, Jincheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Continental Bank. These banks often enter into note-using contracts with small money shops to promote their banknotes. The other category is banks such as Donglai, Pudong, and Shanghai Silk Industry, which do not have the right to issue banknotes. They use the marked banknotes of the Central Bank used by these banks to promote the banknotes. This is because the rules for using exchange notes of the Central Bank stipulate that only banks and remittance money shops are allowed to use them, and they must use banknotes according to the distribution method of 60% cash and 40% guarantee. Small money shops do not have this right to use banknotes. The method for small money shops to use banknotes is mostly to use cash in full, but the bank pays interest of 6% to 7.5% per annum on the 40% cash of the guarantee reserve, and the settlement is made at the end of each year. The root cause of the note-using dispute is that a small number of banks refused to pay the 40% cash interest after November 4th and strongly advocated canceling the contract. They did not contact the relevant peers to study the issue beforehand, and afterwards, they mostly watched and waited, failing to take a consistent attitude. This is the reason why the disputes have arisen one after another.</p>
<p>Since there are two types of note-using disputes, the solutions cannot be completely the same. However, if the first type of dispute is resolved as a whole, then the second type of dispute should not be difficult to resolve as well. Please allow us to only discuss the first type of dispute. On the issuing bank's side, since the right to issue has been revoked and the reserve funds have been taken over, and the banknotes currently in circulation are limited to being gradually withdrawn within two years, the receiving bank can dispose of and destroy the amount it has recovered at any time without waiting for the original issuing bank's consent. In this case, the fate of the issuer is in the hands of others, and it seems excessive to force them to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the contract. On the other hand, from the perspective of the note-using party, the past contributions to promotion cannot be ignored, but in the future, there is no need for recall and no need to continue promotion, and the procedures are simpler. It seems that it is also necessary to understand the issuing bank's plight and endure considerable sacrifices to seek a unified resolution of the situation. Therefore, it is inevitable that the note-using contract should be revised. The only question is how to revise it. A consistent and fair approach by all banks is the only way to ensure that it is appropriate. We believe that, in addition to earnestly negotiating this point with the note-using money shops, each issuing bank should also jointly request that the Ministry of Finance announce specific measures to exchange and withdraw the banknotes of each bank in order to reduce the factors of dispute and also serve as a basis for calculating interest in the future. If this is done, then the note-using issue may be thoroughly resolved.</p>

<p>Nanjing Inheritance Tax Regulations: The Executive Yuan reviewed and revised them. The full text still consists of seven chapters and thirty articles, but Articles 6, 10, 12, 20, 26, and 28 have been slightly revised. For example, Article 6, which originally stipulated a penalty of double the tax evaded for concealing assets with the intention of reducing or evading tax, is now changed to two to five times the tax evaded. Article 10, the tax rates have been changed in each category. No tax is levied on estates valued at less than 5,000 yuan; 1% is levied on the amount from 5,000 to 20,000 yuan; 2% is levied on the amount exceeding 35,000 to 50,000 yuan; 2.5% is levied on the amount exceeding 50,000 to 75,000 yuan; and 3% is levied on the amount exceeding 75,000 to 100,000 yuan.

<h3>Compulsory Enforcement Law: Initial Draft to be Completed Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The initial draft of the Compulsory Enforcement Law being drafted by the Civil Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan will be completed within two weeks. After soliciting the opinions of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. According to Chuan Bingchang, convener of the Civil Law Committee, the procedures for auctioning movable and immovable property stipulated in the law are more advanced than the current methods. There are clear restrictions not only on the auction price, timeliness, and final decision, in order to avoid the current malpractices of delays in enforcement, but also the auction procedures for movable and immovable property are individually specified due to their different natures, thereby protecting the interests of both creditors and debtors. After the law is promulgated, the stagnation in real estate transactions caused by the current delay in enforcement methods can gradually be improved. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3>Regarding the Locarno Treaty, Germany Proposes a Counter-Proposal to England, Considering the Points Raised by the French Foreign Minister, German Representative Travels to London by Plane</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to an official announcement, the government's counter-proposal to the Locarno Four-Power Treaty has been taken to London this afternoon by Ribbentrop, a close confidant of Führer Hitler. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin: General Ribbentrop, Hitler's special envoy, flew to London this afternoon with the German reply to the four-power memorandum of England and France. According to official sources, Ribbentrop will deliver the reply to the British government tonight. The reply was originally scheduled to be completed on Sunday, but the delay was due to the difficulty in devising proposals that could be accepted by both England and France, and the fact that the outcome of the German general election has greatly increased Hitler's power. It is also said that another reason is that the German government wished to fully consider the election speech made by French Foreign Minister Flandin yesterday, in which he asked Hitler to answer several questions related to the overall European situation, and to fully consider the recommendations of the Anglo-French chiefs of staff. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>London: The counter-proposal that the German government should have submitted to the draft Locarno Four-Power Treaty has been decided to be brought here by Ribbentrop, a close confidant of the German Führer Hitler. It is generally expected that it will be delivered late tonight. The Foreign Office has made special arrangements to ensure that Foreign Secretary Eden can immediately learn its contents. Some observers interpret the German government's delay in sending the counter-proposal as an indication that the country intends to adopt a more moderate attitude, and say that after Ribbentrop's meeting with Foreign Secretary Eden some days ago, he originally intended to suggest to the German government that it make some compromises on the issue of the Rhineland region. Some people therefore hope that the counter-proposal that Ribbentrop brings tonight will include this compromise. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>London: The German government is scheduled to submit a counter-proposal to the draft Locarno Four-Power Treaty today, and the general public is very concerned, believing that if this counter-proposal is mostly acceptable, the current situation will inevitably change completely. At that time, the signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, namely England, France, Belgium and Italy, will have to decide unanimously whether they are satisfied with this counter-proposal, whether through diplomatic channels to exchange views, or by holding a meeting in Brussels. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Belgian General Staffs to Continue Negotiations, Said to Promote Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>London: In accordance with the draft agreement established at the Locarno Conference on March 19, the British government will send letters to France and Belgium, declaring its guarantee of the security of those countries, and the general staffs of England, France, and Belgium will conduct talks and conclude military agreements to implement it. Regarding this, political figures recently announced that the British government is now prepared to send this letter to the French government, but hopes that the French government will first provide assurances, declaring that the military agreement of the three general staffs will be interpreted in the same way as the military agreements that France and Belgium have already concluded. If France accepts this proposal, the British government will include the special clauses contained in the Franco-Belgian military agreement in its letter to the French government. These clauses state that "This military agreement does not include political obligations, and does not accept any obligations related to the national defense organizations of each country." This move by the British government indicates that it does not want to take any preparatory measures, such as implementing a compulsory conscription system (Britain has always used a volunteer military system), and wants to retain political freedom. It is generally expected that the French government will submit a reply to this British request within today, so that the British cabinet can take a final decision at its meeting tomorrow. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>London: The date on which the talks that the general staffs of England, France, and Belgium should conduct in accordance with the Locarno Treaty will begin will be decided at the British cabinet meeting tomorrow. Regardless of the content of the counter-proposal that the German government may put forward to the Locarno Treaty, these talks should still begin. It is generally believed that these talks can give France a sense of security, thereby gaining the necessary trust for future negotiations between all parties related to the Locarno Treaty. (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>London: Today, it is widely rumored that there are extremely inconsistent opinions among British cabinet members regarding the Anglo-French-Belgian military talks stipulated in the annex to the four-power draft, and at the same time, a majority of members of the House of Commons and the House of Lords have received a large number of opinions from all walks of life, all expressing opposition to the meeting of the general staff personnel of various countries. (National Telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>Paris: Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the L'Œuvre newspaper, recently published an article stating that Ambassador Corbin to England, together with the British Foreign Secretary Eden and the official at the Quai d'Orsay, had a long consultation yesterday afternoon on the issue of the future Locarno Conference. It is reported that Ambassador Corbin often stated to Eden that France wishes this conference to be held in Brussels before Easter. However, Britain believes that the date of the conference can only be decided after a thorough study of the counter-proposal that Germany should put forward. In general, Britain's intention at this moment is only to try its best to delay the time, so that public opinion in the main countries concerned can observe the situation with a calm attitude, "because Britain hopes that Germany may be able to participate in the future negotiations of the countries concerned within a few weeks." (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Rome: Regarding the draft agreement of the Locarno Conference, the counter-proposal that the German government intends to put forward will be studied by the four signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty (namely England, France, Belgium, and Italy) at a meeting in Brussels in the near future. It is learned that Italy will also send personnel to participate at that time. However, according to semi-official sources, Italy will continue to adopt a reserved attitude towards the future Locarno Conference, which is no different from the London Conference. In other words, Italy will maintain its freedom of action as long as the sanctions continue to be implemented. Regarding participation in the talks between the general staffs of England, France, and Belgium, Italy's attitude has not yet been decided at this moment, and it will only be determined after the Brussels Conference is over. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>London: According to what our reporter knows, the contents of the counter-proposal that Germany should put forward tomorrow are satisfactory to the countries concerned. The Foreign Office has not yet received the report from Sir Phipps, the British Ambassador to Germany, and it is not yet known whether the German representative Ribbentrop has been ordered to return to London to resume mediation. In general, if the German counter-proposal can be considered satisfactory, then the talks between the general staffs of England and Germany may be held at the same time as the talks between the general staffs of England, France, and Belgium. Foreign Secretary Eden is now scheduled to meet with Belgian Ambassador de Marchant tomorrow to discuss the issue of the talks between the three general staffs. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>French and German Newspapers Criticize Each Other, German Election Said to Have Foul Play</h3>
<p>Berlin: Semi-official figures here have expressed resentment at the speech made by French Foreign Minister Flandin on Sunday, considering it to be "an insult to Germany and a non-constructive proposal," and therefore of no benefit to the efforts made by the German foreign authorities. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung wrote that Germany's construction of defensive fortifications in the Rhineland region was done calmly, not hastily, and not concealed, "This move can be a precursor to establishing true peace, as long as France sincerely hopes for peace and understands that the way to achieve peace is not through means of bullying the weak. Then, peace may be achieved. The German government will submit concrete proposals tomorrow to publicly and as fully as possible answer the various questions raised by Flandin." (Havas dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Noted reporter Old Schacht recently published an article in the Berliner Tageblatt commenting on the speech made yesterday by French Foreign Minister Flandin, saying, "After hearing this speech, the responsibilities of the German foreign authorities will probably not be easy to handle." Referring to the various questions raised by Flandin to Germany, namely what intentions Germany has towards Memel, Danzig, and Austria, Schacht said, "If all member states of the League of Nations acted as France did and raised questions on behalf of other countries, where would the European situation end up? In short, we are unwilling to provide any guarantees whose nature is such that people believe that we abide by treaties less than other countries." (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: It is rumored that during yesterday's general election, the majority of blank ballots were also counted as votes in favor of Hitler. The relevant parties have not acknowledged this statement. According to this vote, the list of candidates only includes one type submitted by the Nazi Party, which clearly does not conform to the multi-party election system stipulated by the Weimar Constitution. In addition, this ballot has a blank circle at the bottom. Those who support Führer Hitler should draw a cross in the circle. Those who oppose it should originally write the word "No," but leaving handwriting may cause people to recognize them and lead to accusations. If they want to tear up the ballot, the surveillance is strict (the ballot box is separated from the room where the large team of voters and the Nazi Party troops are located by only a curtain), making it difficult to carry out. Therefore, opponents only have one method: not to draw a cross and cast a blank ballot. From the different methods of announcing the election results last night (until 9:00 PM last night, the ballots were originally divided into invalid ballots and valid ballots, but later they were only divided into two types: votes in favor and votes against), it can be seen that the number of blank ballots must be much higher than the official expectations.

<h3>Sweden and Switzerland Increase National Defense, Especially Focusing on Air Force</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Yesterday, the government put forward a proposal to increase and modernize national defense, which stipulates that: the annual air force expenditure will increase from 11 million kronor to 21 million kronor; light and medium bomber squadrons will be established; the naval power will be fully maintained; the existing battleships will be modernized; new destroyers and submarines will be built; and the army will be equipped with more heavy artillery and machine guns. (Reuters dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The government has decided to submit a national defense strengthening and modernization plan to the parliament. The most important part is the air force and air defense. According to this plan, air force expenditure will increase to 21,000,000 kronor per year (the Swedish currency name), which is an increase of 10,000,000 kronor compared to the current expenditure. In the naval aspect, it is planned to add light fleets and medium-sized gunboats. In the army aspect, although the number of national regiments will be reduced, their personnel will be increased. At present, the Swedish government is composed of the Social Democratic Party, and the military expansion expenditure it has proposed is quite considerable, but the central and right-wing parties in the opposition are still not satisfied and advocate further expansion.

<p>Bern, Switzerland: The Federal Council recently held a meeting. The Minister of the Army, Minger, explained that the international situation is uneasy, and the Swiss border defense must be strengthened. The required funding is 235,000,000 Swiss francs, which will be allocated over several years, or public bonds will be issued to raise funds. The Executive Yuan then decided to build 40 military aircraft to strengthen the air force. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Aviation Bill for Second Reading, Increased Subsidies for Private Aviation</h3>
<p>London: When British Air Ministry Official Sassoon submitted the Aviation Bill for a second reading in the House of Commons yesterday, some members criticized the British Imperial aviation industry. The bill advocates giving private aviation transportation subsidies of 1.5 million pounds per year from the end of 1940 to the end of 1953. The current subsidy is 1 million pounds. Conservative Party member Nabbasen moved to reject the bill, pointing out that the British Imperial private aviation industry is not worth mentioning. Female member Tate seconded, saying that Australia intends to use American aircraft to take over the aviation business from Singapore to Sydney. At the same time, the Greater American Airlines is about to operate to Australia. For the benefit of Britain, we must operate from Singapore to Hong Kong to Shanghai. However, Greater American Airlines is currently competing with German Airlines for this business. She believes that German Airlines will expand its business from China to India, Persia, and Europe. Conservative Party member Sears defended the British private aviation industry, saying that the British Imperial Airways is the best in the world, but if the subsidy problem is not resolved, the company will not be able to order new aircraft to operate the British Imperial routes. Liberal Party member Mendes said that Britain has reason to be proud of the British Imperial Airways. Sassoon replied that the British Imperial Airways flies more miles per year than the airlines of France, the Netherlands, or Italy, and receives fewer subsidies. Last year, the British Imperial Airways' business across the English Channel was more than the combined number of foreign competitors. Furthermore, foreign competitors are now gradually adopting the British Imperial Airways' system. After the second reading, the bill passed with 140 votes to 35 votes.

<p>Berlin: The Hindenburg airship, which flew out yesterday morning, is taking the route through Holland, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay towards South America. Because the French authorities have not yet issued a permit for the ship to fly over French territory, this voyage cannot take the route through France. (National Telegram on the 31st)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Side Claims That Outer Mongolian Aircraft Bombed Japanese and Puppet Troops; The Kwantung Army and the Puppet Government Lodged Protests; The Changlingzi Incident Is Expected to Be Resolved Peacefully</h3>
<p>Changchun - According to a statement from the Kwantung Army, a border surveillance team composed of Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops was patrolling by car near the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border on the morning of the 29th. At 1:20 PM, at Taiwulun (80 kilometers southwest of Arxan, 20 kilometers north of a location within "Manchukuo" territory), two Outer Mongolian military aircraft suddenly crossed the border and began bombing, killing one and wounding four Japanese and "Manchukuo" soldiers.

<p>Tokyo - According to reliable sources, a report was received on the afternoon of the 30th that the Korean Army authorities insisted on resolving the Changlingzi incident locally and decided to hold talks between Japanese and Russian representatives in Hunchun on the 30th to seek a resolution.

As a result of the talks, the Russian side had already placed the bodies of First-Class Medical Officer Yota and one soldier in luggage for safekeeping and would notify the location and time of handover on the 31st. The attitude of the Russian representatives that day was extremely cordial and serious, so it can be anticipated that this case will be resolved satisfactorily. (31st Domei dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Unifies Intelligence Agencies, Expands International Propaganda, Establishes Committee Directly Under the Cabinet, Domei and Dentsu Merge</h3>
<p>Tokyo - At today's regular cabinet meeting, the establishment of an Information Committee was discussed. All cabinet members unanimously agreed that the merger of Domei and Dentsu had been successful and that this opportunity should be seized to promote the unification of intelligence agencies to expand international propaganda. It was decided to implement the long-pending Information Committee as soon as possible. The cabinet will unify the existing intelligence agencies of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministries and place them directly under the cabinet, with the Chief Cabinet Secretary as chairman and the vice-ministers of the Foreign, Home, Army, Navy, and Communications Ministries and the heads of directly related agencies as committee members. The committee will be established immediately and formally organized after the budget passes the Diet. (31st Hua-Lian dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Regarding the establishment of a powerful news agency, Domei News Agency, which had already been established as a corporate entity, had been negotiating a merger with the Japan Telegraphic Communication Company (Dentsu). It has now received formal approval from Dentsu. Therefore, Minister of Communications Raimaki reported this matter at the cabinet meeting on the 31st, and after receiving approval, made the following statement at the Ministry of Communications in the afternoon of the same day: "In view of the recent international situation and the trends in the communications field of various countries, Japan must also build a rapid and reliable powerful news agency, which is one of Japan's important national policies today. By enriching the domestic and foreign independent reporting network and utilizing wireless broadcasting and other modern communication equipment, the accuracy and speed of domestic and foreign reporting can be improved, stimulating sound public opinion domestically and enhancing international understanding of Japan's actual situation and intentions internationally. Therefore, I feel that this facility is extremely important. However, in our country, there has historically been a rivalry between the Japan Telegraphic Communication Company and the News Rengo-sha. If this situation is allowed to continue, there would be many regrets in implementing the national communication policy. Therefore, the government intends to merge these two companies into one, creating a single large news agency and deeply feeling the necessity of this step, making it a public interest corporation so that it can contribute to the implementation of national policy. As a result of negotiations with the two companies, both parties have approved. From now on, the national policy of communications unification can be implemented, which is extremely gratifying. Recently, the two companies will coordinate all procedures and plan to reorganize its substance from May 1st, becoming a powerful major news agency, on par with major news agencies around the world, to fulfill the great mission of achieving peace in the world and implementing Japan's national policy. This is what we anticipate." (31st Domei dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Election Campaign; Two Major Parties Actively Proceeding</h3>
<p>New York - Republican National Committee Chairman Fletcher announced today that his party's presidential election campaign would be accelerated and that regional conferences would be held before the national convention in Cleveland in mid-June. Observers believe this is the starting point for the Republican Party's efforts to overthrow President Roosevelt, while the Democratic Party's campaign will begin on April 13, with President Roosevelt personally delivering a speech. It is expected that this year's political battle will be very intense. Democratic National Committee Chairman Farley may resign from his position as Postmaster General to devote himself to the campaign to re-elect Roosevelt as president. Currently, there are three candidates willing to be Republican presidential candidates: Senators Borah, Knox, and Landon. Former President Hoover intends to support Senator Vandenberg, but Vandenberg has not commented on this today. As for Hoover himself, although he has repeatedly attacked the New Deal, he has not yet declared his willingness to run for president. At the same time, the American Liberty League, organized by Republicans and Democrats opposed to the New Deal, today requested that all parties adopt a platform opposing the weakening of federal judicial power, as New Deal figures, in view of the Supreme Court's repeated rulings that new laws are invalid, have a strong intention to find ways to limit the power of the courts. Columbia University President Butler today warned the Republican Party that the upcoming election will definitely fail if the party does not have more candidates than the three or four currently proposed, as Borah would support many New Deal measures, while also claiming that the New Deal has destroyed the nation's currency, and Landon's strength is actually rather weak.

<h3>Pan-American Peace Conference; Neutrality Issue Will Be an Important Agenda Item</h3>
<p>Washington - The Pan-American Peace Conference initiated by President Roosevelt was originally scheduled to be held in the capital of Argentina. Undersecretary of State Welles recently met with Argentine Ambassador Dr. Espil to discuss the agenda, intending to include the neutrality policies that North and South American countries should implement in the event of war. Welles also argued that North and South American countries should act together not only in the event of war in the Western Hemisphere but also in the event of war in Europe. It is generally believed that today's talks, although of a semi-formal and preliminary nature, indicate that the issue of neutrality will inevitably occupy an important position when the Pan-American Peace Conference convenes in the future. According to some diplomats, the neutrality policy advocated by the United States applies equally to all belligerent countries, regardless of whether they are aggressors or victims of aggression, but the current policy of the League of Nations, which should be observed by the American member states, treats aggressors and victims of aggression differently. These viewpoints are diametrically opposed, and it is feared that reconciliation will not be easy to begin. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome - According to recent military reports from the front, Italian forces on the northern front are now close to the Abyssinian city of Gondar and will soon be able to capture it. It is not far from Lake Tana and is an important stronghold on the Abyssinian northern route. The city of Socota, east of Yeda, has already been occupied by Italian forces. It is located west of Gualan City, at the intersection of the north-south highway and other major roads, and the surrounding area is strategically important. After occupying this area, Italian forces can use it as a base to launch new offensives. It is now reported that 100,000 Abyssinian troops are concentrated in the area north of Gualan City, near Lake Achangi, personally commanded by Emperor Haile Selassie. With the two armies facing each other, a clash is inevitable. As for the southern front, the forces commanded by Italian General Graziani are currently making meticulous preparations and will launch a major offensive soon. The recent bombing of the cities of Harar and Jijiga by Italian aircraft may be the prelude to a major battle. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Recently, a squadron of Italian aircraft dropped countless poison gas bombs on the town of Inda Mekhoni near Amba Aradam. One Italian aircraft was hit by Abyssinian anti-aircraft guns, caught fire after being hit, and was destroyed. (30th Kuo-Min dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Italian aircraft have recently been flying continuously over the northern front, dropping iburi poison gas bombs (a type of poison gas used by the German army on the Belgian-French border near Ypres during the First World War, later named after the place) and sometimes disseminating leaflets to the local people to confuse them. For example, a leaflet dropped in the Gopo area read: "People of Tigray Province, Gojjam Province, Gondar Province, and Wollo Province, the people of our colonies of Eritrea and Somaliland used to suffer from tyranny and enjoy welfare. You have been oppressed under the rule of the soil and will never enjoy equal rights. Do not shed blood for these people. The Italian army will soon arrive, and then you will be able to see the light of day," etc. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Forces Conduct Extensive Bombing; Abyssinia Protests to the League of Nations; British House of Lords Also Discusses</h3>
<p>Geneva - Large numbers of Italian aircraft bombed the city of Harar on the southern front of Abyssinia yesterday, causing significant damage. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently received a protest letter from Abyssinian Foreign Minister Heruy, stating that Harar is an undefended city where wounded Abyssinian soldiers are being treated, "At 7:30 AM on March 29, 37 Italian aircraft flew over the city and bombed it, and strafed it with machine guns, for an hour. The number of casualties is not yet known," but it is known that two churches, a French Catholic mission, a hospital, the French Consulate radio station, and a prison were destroyed. In addition, the Egyptian "Red Crescent Hospital" was hit by 15 bombs, and the Abyssinian Red Cross Hospital was also hit by several bombs. Both hospitals were flying Red Cross flags. Furthermore, the residence of General Emiru, the former Italian consulate, was also bombed. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London - When the House of Lords met tonight, it paid attention to the news from Abyssinia that Italian forces were using poison gas in the war in Abyssinia. Viscount Cecil raised the matter and asked the government if it had received reliable information that this was the case, and if so, what steps it planned to take. Bishop Lang of Canterbury supported Cecil, saying that the tactics used in the Italian-Abyssinian war not only violated Christian principles but also the most fundamental principles of humanity itself. The use of poison gas would affect other African peoples, who are currently carefully watching the conduct of the war. He would be greatly comforted if he could receive assurance that this statement was unfounded or grossly exaggerated. If the reports were true and accurate, he hoped that the nations of the world would rise up in solemn admonition and protest. Lord Privy Seal Halifax, on behalf of the government, replied that he very much wished he could give assurance that this statement was unfounded, but he had only received very brief information on the matter. He sympathized with the serious opinions expressed by the two senators a moment ago. This matter would certainly have repercussions on the relationship between whites and blacks. The Committee of Thirteen had already submitted the Abyssinian government's complaint that Italian forces were using poison gas to the Italian government. If this statement were true, the Committee of Thirteen would propose action to deal with it. The British government could only act in concert with other League of Nations member states. If this statement were true, the British government would be pleased and responsible for attending the conference when the League of Nations discussed the matter, doing its utmost to condemn such a great crime against civilization.

<h3>Iran Withdraws Diplomatic Representatives to the United States Due to Insulting Words Published in American Newspapers</h3>
<p>Washington - The State Department stated today that Persia has recently withdrawn its diplomatic representatives to the United States. Subsequent negotiations between the two countries will be communicated by the US diplomatic representative to Iran. The Persian embassy staff here, apart from the minister, consist of only two secretaries and a counselor. US minister to Persia, Hornite, has also been ordered to transfer to Afghanistan. (30th Kuo-Min dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - The government of Iran has decided to withdraw its embassy and consulates in the United States because the Iranian minister to the United States, Ghajar, was arrested in Acton, Maryland, last October for speeding in a car. Local police did not release Ghajar immediately because he enjoyed diplomatic privileges. Ghajar immediately returned to Washington, D.C., and protested to the State Department. He was not recalled to Iran until January 14 of this year. Afterwards, American newspapers published comments on the case, which the Iranian government said insulted the Iranian king and nation, so it decided to withdraw the minister and consulates and entrust negotiations between the United States and Iran to the US embassy in Iran. Although this decision by the Iranian government cannot be considered a severance of diplomatic relations, the US State Department has refused to comment, but some senior officials still expressed regret.

<h3>Lindbergh Kidnapping Case; Hauptmann Executed; Request for Reprieve Denied</h3>
<p>Trenton, USA - Hauptmann, who kidnapped and killed Colonel Lindbergh's young son, was denied a pardon today by the New Jersey Court of Pardons. The court's six-hour study of the case completely cut off Hauptmann's last chance of survival. Governor Hoffman has also stated that he will not grant another reprieve. After hearing the news, Hauptmann's wife went to visit him in prison. It is said that Hauptmann was initially very calm, confident that he would not be executed, but when he learned that the court had rejected his request, he almost fainted. Hauptmann is now scheduled to go to the electric chair on Tuesday night. All execution procedures in the prison have been prepared. (30th Kuo-Min dispatch)</p>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey - When the State Pardon Court opened, it was just 33 hours before the execution of Hauptmann, the principal offender in the Lindbergh kidnapping case. Governor Hoffman submitted a report detailing his own investigation of the kidnapping after Hauptmann announced a reprieve. Later, crime expert Hicks presented an instrument, claiming that the wood used for the ladder used by the kidnapper was different from that found in Hauptmann's workshop. If this layer is indeed accurate, then some witness testimony is erroneous. The Pardon Court has only two options: to announce another reprieve or to reduce the death penalty to life imprisonment. As a result, the request for a reprieve was ultimately denied. (30th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>South of Hainan Island; Steamer "Ping An" Runs Aground</h3>
<p>Manila - The Chinese ship Ping An, registered in Tianjin, ran aground on West York Island south of Hainan Island and is feared to have sunk. The ship sent out a distress call early this morning, saying that the ship was sinking and asking for immediate rescue. Shortly after, the distress call went silent, so the naval authorities here are deeply concerned that the ship has sunk. The ship's crew are Japanese, and the sailors are Chinese. It was traveling from Hong Kong to Rédès, Vietnam. (31st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The "Ping An," owned by the North China Shipping Company of Tianjin, was chartered to Mitsui Bussan and was en route from Qingdao to Rédès when it sent out a distress call at 10:00 AM today, saying that it was sinking near Baker Island in Tokyo Bay. The site is 400 nautical miles from Hong Kong. Local naval authorities hesitated, as there was a risk of passing through the Hainan Strait at night, so they sent out a wireless message to ships sailing nearby, asking them to come to the rescue.

<p>Smuggling in North China Becomes More Rampant</p>
<h3>Armed Gangsters Escort Smuggled Goods; Qinhuangdao Customs Officer Beaten —Japanese Military Police Interfere with Anti-Smuggling— Tianjin Customs Commissioner Requests Railway Bureau's Full Assistance; Large Quantities of Smuggled Goods Transported South from Tianjin East Station</h3>
<p>Tianjin Two British anti-smuggling squad leaders of the Qinhuangdao Customs, together with several customs officers, discovered six ships carrying over a hundred tons of smuggled sugar arriving from Dalian in the port on the morning of the 28th. As they were about to unload, the goods were seized. However, when the customs officers returned to the customs office, they were ambushed by more than 30 gangsters armed with weapons, who severely beat them. British Deputy Squad Leader鸠参 had both legs broken, and several Chinese customs officers also suffered serious injuries. The British squad leader escaped to the Kailuan coal ship "Kaiping," avoiding injury. The smuggled goods were then seized. The injured customs officers were taken to Kailuan Hospital for treatment. Qinhuangdao Chief Customs Officer郝各得 telegraphed Beijing, requesting instructions for negotiations. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin On the morning of the 31st, armed gangsters escorted 80 pieces of rayon, attempting to transport them from Tianjin Main Station. Railway staff requested customs inspection, and customs officers also arrived to stop them. The gangsters even threatened violence but were eventually forced to load the goods onto the train and transport them to Ping. Tianjin West Station seized 360 bags of sugar being smuggled by unscrupulous merchants. On the 31st, Japanese military police intervened, claiming that the goods arrived in Tianjin before the new anti-smuggling law was implemented and therefore could not be subject to the new regulations. The customs officers' protests were ineffective, and the goods were loaded onto trains and transported to Baitouzhen. On the morning of the 31st, another 840 bags arrived at West Station from a certain concession, awaiting transportation south. Customs is monitoring the situation. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin On the 31st, 6,600 bags of sugar, 600 bundles of rayon, and large quantities of tobacco, liquor, sesame, and yarn were smuggled from Beidaihe and transported south through Tianjin East and Main Stations.

Tianjin Customs Supervisor 林世则 is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 2nd to report the current state of smuggling in North China to the Ministry of Finance. (31st Dispatch)</p>

Customs is working to overcome this difficulty while also requesting instructions from the ministry by telegram. (31st Dispatch)</p>

The most recent batch transported by train included 6,000 bags of sugar and 640 bundles of rayon and cotton. Efforts to prevent the sale of smuggled goods in Tianjin have been ineffective because smugglers are using highway transport to avoid customs authorities. It is reported that Nanjing is currently holding meetings to discuss this matter. At the same time, eastern Hebei is levying a small tax on goods landed in non-garrisoned areas.

<h3>Establishing Accounting Personnel in Central Government Agencies; Legislative Yuan Committees to Hold Discussions</h3>
<p>Nanjing After the State Council ordered the Legislative Yuan to deliberate on the proposal to establish accounting personnel in central government agencies, President Sun forwarded it to the Legislative and Financial Committees for review. The committees believe that the revised Ministry of Finance Organization Law already includes provisions for establishing a chief accountant, setting a precedent for an independent accounting system. The establishment of accounting personnel in other central government agencies should follow suit to ensure uniformity. It is understood that the committees have already designated members to draft amendments to the organizational laws of central government agencies to accommodate the establishment of accounting personnel. These amendments will soon be submitted to a joint committee meeting for discussion. The establishment of accounting personnel in central government agencies will be based on the volume of revenue and expenditure. Agencies with higher volumes will have a chief accountant, while those with lower volumes will have a chief accounting officer or accounting staff. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education will also have a chief statistician. All newly established accounting personnel in various agencies will be directly responsible to the Central Accounting Office. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

In addition to proposing to the provincial government meeting the establishment of a Bureau of Commerce to control and develop commerce, Provincial Government Member Xiao Chunjin and others went to Zhejiang Province to thoroughly discuss with Chairman Huang the economic connection and promotion between the two provinces. At the same time, gentry and merchants from Jiangxi Province, including Hu Siyi, Wang Mingxuan, Qi Futian, Lu Fuchuang, as well as managers from the Nanchang branches of Central, China, Transportation, and Continental Banks, and representatives from the Provincial Yumin Bank and Municipal Banks, were invited by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to Hangzhou on the 27th by special train. They held separate meetings with the Zhejiang Provincial Commerce Bureau, Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce, and banking circles to discuss and connect with each other. Bureau Chief Zhu of the Zhejiang Commerce Bureau proposed measures, including holding a joint special product exhibition in Hangzhou in the first step, forming a mixed investigation team by both parties in the second step, and mutually dispatching personnel to establish agencies in both provinces in the third step to serve as transport and sales agencies. As for the special products of the two provinces, Jiangxi Province has porcelain, rice, coal, sugar, summer cloth, etc., while Zhejiang Province has silk, Shaoxing wine, Jinhua ham, paper umbrellas, various handicrafts, seafood, fish, and salt, etc. The above-mentioned special products of the two provinces are mutually needed. If sound transport and sales methods can be obtained, it will greatly benefit the economies of both provinces. (March 30th)</p>
<h3>Record of the Public Trial of the Wang Case</h3>
<p>First Day of Trial for the Three Defendants Zhang, He, and Liu</p>
<p>Confessing to Conspiracy to Assassinate Without Remorse, but Still Evading</p>
<p>The six accomplices in the assassination attempt on former President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Yuhua, He Boguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi, were arrested and transferred to the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for trial. After investigation and prosecution by Prosecutor Luo Renji of the court, the court appointed Lu Wenlan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, and judges Long Canya and Wu Yuheng to form a trial panel. The trial was held publicly at the Criminal Court of the Capital District Court at 1:00 PM on the 30th. Due to the serious nature of the case, the number of people attending the trial reached as many as five or six hundred. The crowded situation was unprecedented since the court began handling cases. On that day, the three defendants, Zhang Yuhua, He Boguang, and Liu Shurong, were interrogated in detail. They were extremely cunning, attempting to evade and shirk responsibility for important parts of the case. Due to time constraints, the trial of the three defendants, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi, was scheduled to continue at 1:00 PM on the 31st at the original court. The details of the court hearing on the 30th are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Crowded in the Audience</p>
<p>Breaking Unprecedented Records</p>
<p>Recalling the news of President Wang's assassination attempt by the assassin Sun Fengming at the Central Party Headquarters on November 1st of last year, not only was the entire country shocked, but all countries around the world were also deeply concerned. This was truly a rare and major case in the history of our country. Once the main culprits were arrested and publicly tried, people from all walks of life in society wanted to know the details. Therefore, on the 30th, the number of people who went to the Capital District Court to attend the trial reached as many as five or six hundred. It was found that the criminal court used that day was the largest courtroom in the court. Important cases such as Niu Lan, Chen Duxiu, and Jin Shuren were all tried in the court. The court's seating capacity was only about one hundred and fifty people. However, all one hundred and fifty seats had been occupied by the audience around noon, and more and more people continued to arrive. In an instant, the courtroom was crowded with people, leaving no space at all. It was estimated that there were no less than three or four hundred people inside the courtroom, and another one or two hundred people were standing outside the courtroom. The crowded situation was unprecedented. However, everyone was able to maintain order. During the court hearing, it could be described as solemn and silent. Prominent figures in the special audience included Central Committee members Chen Shuren, Wang Maogong, Gu Zhenggang, and Gu Zhengding, Secretary Zhu Wenzhong of the National Government, Counselor Xu Xiangshu of the Executive Yuan, and representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and other agencies.</p>
<p>Weapons Displayed on the Table</p>
<p>Defendants' Faces Looked Dismal</p>
<p>At 1:15 PM, Presiding Judge Lu Wenlan, Judges Long Canya and Wu Yuheng, Prosecutor Luo Ji, Clerk Liu Shuzhe, and others entered the court in succession. In addition to the large volume of case documents presented on the table by the court clerks, a six-round revolver used by the suspect Sun on the day of the crime was also displayed on the table, which was alarming. Subsequently, the defense lawyers of the defendants, Yu Zhongluo, Chen Liren, Liu Zhe, Chen Yaodong, Liu Liumin, Lin Dawen, Tao Rong, and Bao YunGong, also arrived in succession. Then, Clerk Liu, under the order of the presiding judge, announced the opening of the court and the trial of the case. The entire scene suddenly became quiet, and the atmosphere was tense. The presiding judge then summoned the defendants. Zhang Yuhua led the way, followed by He Boguang, Liu Shurong, Li Huaicheng, Xiang Zhonglin, and Lu Qingqi, who entered in succession. The faces of the defendants all showed a dismal and worried expression. When Zhang was arrested in Shanghai, he attempted to escape from the upper floor and was shot in the left foot by the police. Although he was treated at the Central Hospital, he was still unable to walk properly. He used two wooden crutches to support himself, which made walking very inconvenient. He was the most cunning. During the interrogation, his attitude was calm, and he spoke eloquently, trying his best to evade, shirk, and deny, as if he did not bear any significant responsibility for the case. Li Huaicheng was fifty-four years old, with long hair and a short beard, and was the oldest among the defendants. His attitude was also relatively calm. Liu Shurong's answers to the presiding judge's questions were more straightforward. Only the ages and hometowns of Xiang and Lu were questioned. There was no detailed interrogation.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Age and Hometown</p>
<p>Prosecutor Reads the Prosecution Speech</p>
<p>After each defendant stood in a line before the presiding judge, the presiding judge asked about their age, hometown, and occupation one by one. According to Zhang Yuhua's confession, he also went by the names Zhang Siming, Zhang Simin, and Zhang Ji. He was thirty-four years old, a native of Binying, Jiangsu. When he was in Shanghai, he lived at 105 Carter Road. He graduated from Nanjing Provincial High School and once studied at Jinling University. He once worked as a teacher. His father was alive, his mother was dead, and his brother's name was Zhang Bincheng. He was currently in his hometown. His family had land and houses, which could maintain their livelihood.

Liu Shurong confessed that he also went by the name Zhong Hu. He was twenty-nine years old and a native of Binying. He studied in the preparatory course at Shanghai Daxia University. In the 17th year of the Republic, he joined the party through an introduction from Chen Gongbo. He once served as an investigation committee member of the organization department of the provincial party headquarters. He had not joined the Communist Party. He had not committed any crimes before. He had one younger sister. His family had dozens of acres of rice fields and many grass fields. With a small population, his family was able to make a living.

During the Yi Si and Xin Hai years of the Qing Dynasty, he served as the principal. He then participated in revolutionary work. In the 16th year of the Republic, he returned to Zhongying as the principal. During the Qing Dynasty, he joined the Tongmenghui. After the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising, he convened national party members in Shanghai to plan another uprising. During the Wuchang Uprising, he promoted the work in Shanghai. The independence of Jiangyin was instigated by him. During the Second Revolution against Yuan Shikai, he worked with Leng Yiqiu at the front. In the 5th year of the Republic, he planned independence in Zhejiang. After Yuan's death, he stopped. During the Constitutional Protection Movement, he was still working in Zhejiang. Ningbo once declared independence, but after the failure, he went to Guangdong. Dissatisfied with the system of seven directors, he returned to the Yangtze River basin and visited General Manager Sun, advocating for the abolition of the seven directors and planning to instigate Lu Yongxiang to attack Li Chun. General Manager Sun gave him two hundred yuan and prepared a letter of introduction to go to Zhejiang. In the end, Li Chun was assassinated, and Qi Xieyuan's alliance with Lu Yongxiang failed. Afterwards, the Premier took the position of Extraordinary Grand President, representing Jiangsu to Guangdong, urging the Premier to send troops to Guilin to remove Chen Jiongming from his position as military governor. After the Premier suffered misfortune, Chen Jiongming finally failed. He and Yang Hu jointly ran the navy, but due to disagreements, he resigned without saying goodbye. In the 16th year of the Republic, he and Niu Yongjian went to work in Zhejiang, working for the troops of Xia Chao, Zhou Fengqi, Chen Yi, Li Binzhang, and Bi Shucheng. However, he had been engaged in the revolution all his life and had never been an official, so his family property was exhausted. He now has a wife and children, etc. Xiang Zhonglin confessed that he was fifty-three years old and a native of Ningbo.

He had never joined any party. His grandmother, parents, and uncles were all alive. He had five younger brothers. His family property was sufficient to maintain their livelihood. The interrogation continued until 1:50 PM. The presiding judge then asked the prosecutor to announce the content of the prosecution, which was the same as the previously published indictment, and will not be recorded again. At 2:15 PM, after reading the indictment, the presiding judge instructed the defendants, saying that the defendants were all intellectuals and some of them had worked in the Party. The purpose of this crime had political connections, so it was different from ordinary bandits and murderers for money. He hoped that the defendants would not, like ordinary bandits, evade and deny what they had confessed to before in the Military Police Headquarters and the Investigation Court and in their confessions during the trial. As for the things that had not been confessed to before, they could provide as much evidence as possible this time. The court would investigate and deliberate in detail whether it was beneficial or harmful to the defendants. The court would make a fair judgment. At this point, the defendants were interrogated separately. Zhang Yuhua was interrogated first, and the others were dismissed from the court. This was at 2:18 PM.</p>
<p>Interrogating Zhang Yuhua</p>
<p>Evading Important Points</p>
<p>Before the interrogation, the presiding judge instructed Zhang again, urging him to be honest in his statement and not to deny anything. However, Zhang still tried to evade the important points. The following is an excerpt from the presiding judge's questions and answers:</p>
<p>(Question) When did you establish the Chenguang News Agency in Nanjing? (Answer) September of the 23rd year of the Republic. It was Hu Kezhi (i.e., Hu Yunqing), He Boguang, Liu Shurong, and Sun Fengming who were responsible. Hu served as the president, and I was not a staff member. (Question) You have repeatedly confessed that you were responsible for the Chenguang News Agency, and you have also stated it very clearly in your confession. Why are you denying it now? (Answer) When I was arrested in Shanghai, I fell from the upper floor and suffered serious injuries. My brain was greatly stimulated, so when I wrote the confession, it was like writing a novel, not real. (Question) Then, what is your relationship with the Chenguang News Agency? (Answer) When the Chenguang News Agency was established, I acted as a guarantor and helped them find a house. I lived in the agency, that's all. I had already gone to Shanghai the day before President Wang was assassinated. (Question) Where did the Chenguang News Agency's finances come from? (Answer) Hu Kezhi obtained it from Wang Yaqiao in Hong Kong. (Question) Where did Wang Yaqiao get the money from? (Answer) According to Hu Kezhi, it was received from Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen. (Question) Why did Wang Yaqiao ask Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen for money? (Answer) Because they were friends. (Question) What was the purpose of your running the Chenguang News Agency? (Answer) At first, we were really preparing to run a news agency, but Wang Yaqiao and Sun Fengming were dissatisfied with President Wang, so there was this action. (Question) So, you were using the Chenguang News Agency as a cover organization only? (Answer) It wasn't like that at first.</p>
<p>A Total of 40,000 Yuan Received</p>
<p>(Question) How much money did you receive in total? Zhang initially claimed not to know. After the presiding judge presented his previous confession, he finally answered that he had received a total of 40,000 yuan from Chen and Li. More than 30,000 yuan was used by Wang Yaqiao, and we used less than 10,000 yuan in total. It was all sent by Hu Kezhi. (Question) After your two failed assassination attempts, was the financial supply stopped once? (Answer) Yes, it was. (Question) Li Jishen wired 1,000 yuan to Shanghai, right? (Answer) Yes, it was handled by Feng Zhuwan and wired to Shanghai, but he has nothing to do with this case. (Question) You said that Chen and Li provided financial support because of personal relationships. Then, it would have been fine to just borrow money. Why bother running a news agency and providing continuous support? What was the intention after all? You once confessed that Chen and Li wanted to use you to organize an assassination agency to disrupt the public order after the failure of the Fujian Incident so that they could restore their political positions, didn't you? (Answer) I didn't say that in the past. I only said that politicians in general, whether virtuous or unworthy, have the desire to make a comeback after failure. Of course, Chen and Li are also like that. This is just based on personal observation and general discussion. At this point, the presiding judge presented Zhang's confession at the Military Police Headquarters. Zhang still denied it, saying that it was only a general discussion. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japan Orders Changlu Salt, Establishes Joint Sales Company in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Annual Purchase of 3 Million Dan</p>
<p>Exclusively for Chemical and Civil Use</p>
<p>Tianjin Telegraph. The matter of Changlu salt being exported to Japan has recently been concretized, the only difference being that the plan is still awaiting the approval of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Upon investigation, the Japanese side has been deliberately promoting its realization, not overnight. In Japanese food and chemical industries, about 5 million dan of foreign salt need to be imported to make up for the deficiency. In the past, all these insufficient numbers were sought from Africa and Qingdao in our country. At the beginning of the European War, Japan occupied Qingdao and painstakingly promoted the construction of refined salt factories. At that time, more than a dozen factories were established. Later, at the Washington Conference, the sovereignty of Qingdao was returned to us. Although the Japanese refined salt factories were closed down, there were still treaties stipulating that Japan was allowed to purchase 3 million dan of Qing salt for application. The remaining 2 million dan were sought from Africa. Since the outbreak of the war in Africa, salt export has been difficult. Currently, the Japanese side focuses on the development of domestic chemical industry, and the demand for salt has increased. Therefore, they specifically seek to purchase it from a suitable place and then turn to Luyan. After the establishment of the puppet Hebei-East government, it once intercepted the export of Luyan. After negotiations, the old salt stored in Hangu, Tanggu, and Lutai was about 15 million dan. The Japanese side purchased it at a low price, and two batches have been shipped, reaching more than 12,500 dan. The Changlu Salt Transport Office deeply believes that this matter hinders the salt administration and contacted all parties concerned. Except for the Hebei-East area, there are other appropriate measures. The purchase by the Japanese side has become an irresistible trend, so they have reached a principle, hoping to abide by each other and not affect the food of the people in North China due to the export of Luyan. Therefore, the Japanese side has the organization of the Luyan Joint Sales Company, which is jointly invested by Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Iwakyu stores, and established in Tianjin, where the heart is set on receiving the Luyan for export. The export tariff and the loading location are still to be studied and will be implemented after both parties agree. It is said that Changlu salt produces 7 million dan per year, and the remaining amount is sufficient for the food of the people in North China except for those purchased by the Japanese side. The Japanese side plans to purchase and transport about 3 million dan of Luyan in North China. In Qingdao, the freight per dan is 1 yuan and 70 cents in Japanese currency when it arrives at Moji. If it is transported from North China, the freight can be saved a lot, so the purchase from there is stopped. In the future, it is planned to use large steamships for transportation. The distribution of 3 million dan is about 800,000 dan for edible salt, 1.5 million dan for chemical use, and about 700,000 dan for chemical and edible use in Korea. Now the price of Luyan is 10 yuan per package (each package is 500 jin, which is one dan). The so-called chemical industry is most important for making soda ash and well nitrate. Last year, Japan's soda ash sales to North China reached 3 million barrels, each barrel worth more than 20 yuan. In the past, Japan was a country with a soda ash trade deficit. By last year, it became a country with a trade surplus. North China has always been the sales market for soda ash from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Since Japanese goods were transported, they came from behind and invaded the market power of British, American, and French merchants. Therefore, the powers are paying close attention to the purchase and transport of Luyan this time. (29th)</p>
<h3>Western Anhui Tea Market Can Become Prosperous</h3>
<p>Overview of Production and Sales in Four Counties</p>
<p>Garrison Maintains Tea Market</p>
<p>Bengbu Telegraph. The Liuan-Huoshan area in western Anhui has always been a tea-producing area. The Liuan Plum Blossom, which is known to the world, is especially famous at home and abroad. It is known as the Dragon Well of West Lake, the Biluochun of Dongting, the Dafang of Huizhou, and the Maofeng of Huangshan. In recent years, bandits have been harassing, tea merchants have been hesitant, and the tea industry has been declining day by day, leading to financial depletion and commercial hardship. Fortunately, the remnants of the bandits in the area have been successively wiped out by the National Army. Recently, the security of the tea areas in Liuan, Lihuang, Huoqiu, and other counties has been maintained by the Li Mo'an and Liu Mao'en departments responsible for appeasement, and troops have been stationed in major tea markets to protect tea merchants. The Anhui Provincial Government has also contacted the banking community to provide loans to tea farmers to help the tea industry. Now that spring tea is about to be launched on the market, tea merchants from Shandong, Xuzhou, and other places have been flocking to Bengbu to set up shops, preparing for transport. It is expected that this year's tea market will show a prosperous trend, and the refugees in western Anhui will have a chance to recover slightly. Upon investigation, the tea industry in western Anhui is very important and is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. I will now investigate the various situations of the industry and describe them as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Producing Areas</p>
<p>The tea-producing areas in western Anhui include Liuan, Lihuang, Huoqiu, and Huoshan counties. The most famous places include Dushan, Qingshan, Sujiabu, Lianghekou, Luodigang, Shanwanghe, and Maotanchang in Liuan; Mabu, Daxiaomadian, Hujiadian, Liubotuan, Lianhuashan, Wuchangwan, Nanshui, Lishidian, Yangjiatan, Jianjiachong, Chuanbanchong, Disanchong, Sukou, and Youfangdian in Lihuang; Laijiaji, Kaishunjie, and Baitasaka in Huoqiu; and Zhufoan, Banzhuwei, Dahua, Wuqihe, Guanjia, Lan, Manshuihe, and Heishidu in Huoshan. They are all the most famous tea-producing areas.</p>
<p>Types of Tea</p>
<p>Western Anhui has beautiful mountains and rivers, and tea is the main product. Because there is a difference between the inner mountains and the outer mountains, the categories are different. Generally speaking, the color, aroma, quality, and taste of tea are better in the inner mountains and second in the outer mountains. The tea produced in the southwest of Liuan and the area of Lihuang is called black tea, and the best product is produced in Sukou and Liubotuan. The tea produced in the south of Huoshan is called yellow tea, and the best product is produced in Zhufoan. Black tea is called flower box, and yellow tea is called plate basket. Tea sprouts after the willow trees grow leaves, between Qingming and Guyu. The leaves gradually grow, and at this time, the tea trees are green and lovely. By Guyu, they begin to be picked. At this time, it is called spring tea. After picking, new buds sprout and can be picked after forty days of Lixia. This is called Zicha. The color, aroma, quality, and taste are slightly inferior to spring tea. After picking Zicha, the sprouts are picked again, which is called Sancha, which is even worse than Zicha. After that, the sprouts will not be picked, and the vitality of the tea tree must be preserved for picking again in the coming year.</p>
<p>Production Volume</p>
<p>Western Anhui is a tea-producing area, and tea farmers attach great importance to the tea season. The work of picking tea is mostly done by women and young girls, and there are popular tea-picking songs. When singing in the tea mountains, it is clear, melodious, and euphemistic, with a special kind of fun. After the tea leaves are picked, they must be smoked and fried, mostly by men. After smoking and frying, they must be picked, which is called picking tea. The fine tips are picked out, which are called silver needle sparrow tongue. The pure leaves are called Plum Blossom or Gua Pian. During each tea season, more than 100,000 tea workers are used. In the past two or three years, the Anhui Provincial authorities have ordered the Anhui Western Immigration Office to introduce refugees from the border areas to work in the tea areas as a plan to relieve famine. Liuan, Huoqiu, and Huoshan counties produce about 400,000 baskets of high-quality tea each year, with each basket weighing 10 jin, and the total amount has reached more than 4 million jin, which can also show the abundance of production.</p>
<p>Overview of Sales</p>
<p>The largest sales market for tea from western Anhui is Shandong Province. During the tea season every year, tea merchants from Jinan and other places go to transport it in an endless stream. Those sold in Shandong account for 70% to 80%. Secondly, Beijing, Tianjin, northern Jiangsu, eastern Henan, and northern Anhui also have considerable sales markets. It was once sold to Liaoning. After the September 18th Incident, it was impossible to transport it. In the past, during the Taiping era, the towns and towns in western Anhui were quite prosperous and the finance was very active during the tea market period. When the Likin Bureau existed, the annual income was mostly from tea Likin. After the abolition of Likin, the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance holds short-term business tax for the tea industry every year and sets up a bureau to collect taxes. Huaiyuan also has an inspection office. It was found that the market price of spring tea last year was more than three yuan per basket. The market this season is stable, and it is unlikely to rise or fall sharply. It is expected that the tea market this year will show a slight improvement. (29th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Record of a Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>The home of Huang Shiyuan, a carpenter of Four households, Fifth Jia, Eight Bao, Xiangze Township, Sijing, was broken into at night on the 29th by more than a dozen robbers, armed with pistols, etc. The owner was tied up and beaten one by one. His mother and his brothers Qiyuan and Hongsheng were poured cold water into their noses (called Shuanglong takes water) to force them to hand over their valuables. Before leaving, their son, Gui Long (fourteen years old), was taken away. The lost items were only a Hongsheng smoking cessation certificate, two preserved hams, two white sugar, and four yuan in banknotes. The township chief Yang Guozhen has reported it to the city for investigation.</p>
<p>Also, the home of Jin Quantao, a resident of Five households, Seventh Jia, Six Bao, Xupu Township, Tinglin, was broken into by a group of local bandits at night on the 27th, armed with blunderbusses, iron rulers, and other weapons.

The thieves left a broken cotton jacket, ten hemp ropes, and two bullets. It has also been reported to the county bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Dredging Worker Tragically Crushed to Death</p>
<p>Local resident Kan Agui made a living as a worker. On the 28th, Xu Zhengming, the owner of Shunxing Chicken and Duck Firm, instructed him to go to the base of the city root on Sukun Road, Xiaoximen, to level the soil, which was more than two feet high, for the construction of houses. It was not expected that at about 3:00 PM, when he was working, a car sped by. The soil at the top was shaken. After a while, the heavy soil beside Agui suddenly collapsed, causing him to lose his footing and fall to the ground, buried in the mud. After someone discovered it and informed his wife, she quickly dug the soil away, but it was already too late. Not long after, he died. His wife cried loudly while holding the body, and the onlookers were saddened. Later, Xu Zhengming paid 190 yuan in compensation for the coffin.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Chen Ruizhen Sues Early Post</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office recently sent personnel to search the residence of lawyer Chen Ruizhen and took Chen Ruizhen to the court for detention. The next day, he was released on bail. The Suzhou Early Post published the arrest of Chen the morning after Chen was arrested, which was related to the Jiangsu Judicial Improvement Association's attack on Zhu Shusheng, the president of the Jiangsu High Court. Therefore, after Chen was released, he believed that the news published by the Early Post was greatly related to his reputation, and he specifically presented a complaint to the Wu County District Court, accusing Yan Yisheng, the main editor of the Early Post, and the contributor of defamation. The court has scheduled a hearing.</p>
<p>Holding Urban Land Registration</p>
<p>The Wu County Land Bureau is preparing to conduct urban land registration, and the preparations have been completed. Registration will begin on April 1st, starting with sixteen townships such as Kaiming. Other townships will be held in stages. The registration fee is based on the land price, and a registration fee of two yuan is collected for every thousand yuan. The height and the price of land is now under detailed research.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Lidong Township Robbery and Injury Case</p>
<p>At midnight on the 28th of last month, more than twenty robbers went to the home of Jin Congxian, a farmer in Zhujiawan, Lidong Township, Second District. Congxian heard the sound and opened the door to look. The robbers instead asked him what was the matter. Seeing that the situation was not good, Congxian pretended to be returning home after watching the vegetables in the field and turned back into the room and closed the door. The robbers climbed up the bamboo pole to the roof, entered the room and opened the door, and dragged Congxian and his wife and his father, Guixiang, out of the room and beat them. They also burned their legs with fire, forcing them to reveal the location of the hidden gold. Then they looted, and the clothes and ornaments stolen were worth about three hundred yuan. Neighbors heard the sound and rushed to the Nanxiang Public Security Bureau to report and send the police to come. The thieves had already escaped with the loot.</p>
<p>Car Hits the Principal of the Central School</p>
<p>Zang Shiyu, the principal of the Waigang Central Elementary School, was inspecting his schools on his bicycle on the morning of the 28th of last month. When he passed the Jingting area on Xihu Road, four cars were coming east. The last car, No. 19, crashed into Zang's car. Zang suffered a serious injury to the back of his head, about two inches deep. He fainted from the blood loss. The driver immediately helped him into the car and returned to the city, sending him to Jiading Hospital. Zang was still unconscious. After the doctor's treatment, he gradually became awake and there was no danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>New Life Movement Inspection Group Comes to Wuxi to Work</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association’s Inspection Group, led by General Director Qian Dajun, considers Wuxi, Wuxian, and Wujin counties as key counties in Jiangsu Province. A special assignment was given to Tang Lucheng, head of the third group, who traveled from Suzhou to Wuxi to liaise with the Party and government, as well as the public security authorities. It was decided to establish the group's headquarters in the County Public Education Center within the city, with permanently stationed inspectors. Deputy Director Liu Xiang and staff member Zhang Shouzhong will be in Wuxi to oversee all matters. Mr. Liu and others arrived in Wuxi yesterday and will begin the inspection work today (the 1st), with a duration of two weeks. Since yesterday, the Public Security Bureau has increased the number of police officers to guide the public in implementing the New Life Movement and to correct public errors. All major streets and lanes have been thoroughly swept overnight to carry out the "clear walls" campaign. Director Qian Dajun will come to Wuxi for a re-inspection after the inspection work is completed.</p>
<p>Hog Prices Soar</p>
<p>The price of hogs in this county has been soaring in recent days. It is said that Shanghai is experiencing a shortage of supply, so they are purchasing them in Wuxi. Last month, a total of more than 9,000 hogs were transported to Shanghai by truck and ship. Therefore, there is a continued upward trend in hog prices. The meat industry in this county is very alarmed by this situation. However, the retail price is tied to established practices and cannot be drastically increased, which is causing significant business difficulties. Therefore, yesterday (the 31st) at 2:00 PM, a meeting was convened at the Meat Industry Association Hall in Cotton Lane, Ximen, to seek solutions. More than 90 members attended and resolved to set the retail price of fresh meat at 24 cents of national currency per catty, or 4 catties and 8 taels per dollar, according to the source of the hogs. This will be uniformly applied from today (April 1st) onwards, with no discrepancies, to maintain business operations.</p>

<p>Large Group of Japanese Tourists Visit Yushan Mountain</p>
<p>There have been many Japanese tourists visiting Changshu this spring. On the 29th, a large group of 63 people (including 6 women) arrived. Their leader was Takagi Masateru. The day before, they had a Chinese man named Zhang Aban arrange rickshaws. Therefore, after the Japanese arrived by car, the reserved rickshaws were waiting to pick them up. At 10:00 AM, they first arrived outside the west gate of the town, then left the cars and climbed the mountain, visiting places such as Weimo and Brush Water Rock. They also took photos along the way. In the afternoon, they lingered for a long time around the Sanfeng Xingfu area. At about 3:30 PM, they descended from Beishan and took rickshaws back to the station to leave Changshu. It has been discovered that more than a dozen Japanese army officers and generals have visited Yushan recently. On the 26th, there were also two Japanese Koreans. In addition, there are many others whose identities are unknown.</p>
<p>Wild Cat Estuary Opium Case Expanded</p>
<p>At Wild Cat Estuary in Hupu, this county, two large bundles of opium, weighing about one hundred catties, were discovered last winter. Unexpectedly, at the time in the rural area, officers of the garrison patrol ship secretly contacted each other, and only 32 catties were turned over to the county. Later, due to uneven distribution of the spoils, someone secretly reported to the county, and the individuals involved were detained and sent to the Provincial Garrison Headquarters for investigation. Several interrogations have already been conducted. The case has recently been expanded, involving the captain of the garrison patrol ship, Sun Shufan, the chairman of the Fishery Association, Ren Feian, and Fei Qiaosheng. However, Sun was dismissed from his post for another case, and the province issued an arrest warrant. The county government first arrested Ren Feian in Suzhou and sent him to Zhenjiang on the morning of the 30th for interrogation. Others are still wanted.</p>

<h3>Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Fujian Provincial High Court Rectifies the Judiciary of the Entire Province</p>
<p>Since Tong Hangshi has been the head of the Fujian Provincial High Court, he has spared no effort in rectifying the judiciary of the entire province for the past three years. The following is a brief description of the judicial situation over the past three years: (1) Cases: From January to December of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, 8,379 civil cases were concluded and 1,966 were not concluded; 4,830 criminal cases were concluded and 710 were not concluded. From January to December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, 11,425 civil cases were concluded and 1,253 were not concluded; 4,446 criminal cases were concluded and 407 were not concluded. From January to December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, 13,838 civil cases were concluded and 1,085 were not concluded; 7,012 criminal cases were concluded and 615 were not concluded. According to the statistics of concluded cases in various courts in the province over the past three years, the number of cases concluded in the last year was higher than in the previous year, with an increase of more than one-third. (2) Funding: From January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, during these two years, the Fujian Provincial High Court often failed to pay the stamp fees to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, resulting in a debt of more than 100,000 yuan to the ministry. From January to December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Fujian Provincial High Court paid all stamp fees to the ministry in full and did not owe any money at all. As for the salaries of various staff members, they were previously paid at 80% of the full amount, but now they are paid at 85%. (3) Inspection: From January 1st of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the president and chief prosecutor of the Fujian Provincial High Court did not go to various counties to inspect the courts and prisons. From January to December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, President Tong inspected southern Fujian in the first half of the year and northern Fujian in the second half of the year. President Tong personally visited all courts and important counties. However, Chief Prosecutor Xue did not personally inspect. (4) Legal Affairs: From January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the reformatory, new prison, and high sub-court that were planned were not established. From January to December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the establishment of the reformatory was completed, and three high sub-courts were added. Construction of the new Xiamen prison has begun, and the new Fujian prison is also being prepared for construction. However, due to budget review, the original local branch court and judicial office were cut. However, according to the statistics of concluded cases, there has been an increase without a decrease. (5) Court Buildings: From January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to October of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the buildings of the Fujian High Court were dilapidated and not repaired. In the 24th year, President Tong actively managed and renovated the original court site, making it completely new. He also supervised the renovation of the Jinjiang District Court and the Minhou District Court. The relocation of the Xiamen District Court building has also begun to enhance its appearance. (6) Prisons: The prisons in various counties of Fujian were mostly dilapidated and small in the past. Since President Tong's inspection last year, he has supervised the reconstruction and repair of many of them. Those that have been recently reconstructed include Tong'an, Jinjiang, Pucheng, Fuqing, and Yongchun counties. Those that have been repaired or added to include the First Prison of Fuzhou and Minhou, Jian'ou, Changle, Nanping, Shaowu, Hui'an, Zhangpu, Xiapu, Zhangxiao, Xianyou, Dehua, Jinmen, and Zhenghe counties. According to the statistics, more than two-thirds of the prisons in various counties in the province have been reconstructed, added to, or repaired and improved. (7) Prisoners: From January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, there was one escape from the main detention center in Minhou, the provincial capital, and three escapes from the branch center, totaling four escapes. Escapes from other county prisons were frequently heard. From January to December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, there were no escapes from the main or branch detention centers in Minhou, the provincial capital. The number of escapes in various counties was also less than in the previous year. Also, according to the statistics of the number of prisoners in the entire province in the 24th year, it decreased by about one-third compared to the previous year. (8) Trials: From January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China to December of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the trial officers in various counties were not assessed based on the number of cases they handled or their performance. From January to December of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the trial officers in various counties were assessed according to the "Timeliness and Accuracy" system: (A) Checking the appropriateness of their judgments; (B) Calculating the number of cases they concluded each month. The "Timeliness and Accuracy" system was used to determine their performance and to promote, transfer, reward, or punish them. Therefore, the trial officers in various counties are more diligent than before. (9) Stamps: In the past, counties in Fujian that also handled judicial matters did not receive stamps and paper issued by the ministry. The county governments made their own substitutes and did not affix litigation stamps. Therefore, the courts had no income. Since President Tong took office, he has effectively rectified this situation. Recently, this kind of malpractice has been gradually corrected.</p>

<h3>The International Telegraph Administration Is Officially Abolished Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was taken over by the re-assigned agencies. The International Report and Telephone Fee Calculation Office was established separately.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' International Telegraph Administration was ordered to be closed, and the entire process has been completed. The reassignment of affiliated agencies and the redistribution of handled matters have been stipulated by the Ministry's order. Yesterday, various agencies sent personnel to take over, and the administration was officially abolished. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reassignment of Affiliated Agencies: The International Wireless Radio Station is directly under the Ministry of Communications. The Shanghai Coastal Radio Station is incorporated into the International Wireless Radio Station. The Dabeidong Pacific and other underwater cable telegraph receiving and transmitting offices, under the command of the Ministry of Communications, are renamed the Communications Ministry's Telegraph Receiving and Transmitting Office. The Shanghai Broadcasting Station is under the command of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<p>Distribution of Handled Matters: Regarding the distribution of matters handled by the administration, the calculation of international report and telephone fees is handled by the newly established Ministry of Communications' Shanghai-based International Report and Telephone Fee Calculation Office. This office is temporarily located at the original site of the administration. The inspection, licensing of ship radio stations, and the examination and certification of ship radio operators are handled by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. The verification and issuance of temporary news telegram credentials are handled by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. The supervision of Shanghai's privately-owned broadcasting stations is handled by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<p>Personnel Taking Over from Various Parties: Since the administration was ordered to expedite its closure, the process has been completed. Yesterday, Bao Keyong, who was also the acting director of the administration, and the heads of various departments, together with the personnel taking over, handed over the matters. Those who went to take over included Zhang Chenghu, the management engineer of the International Wireless Radio Station, Bao Keyong, the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Lu Zutong, the representative of the Ministry of Communications, Zhao Yiqing, the director of the Calculation Office, and Qiu Manyang, who was sent by the Ministry of Communications to supervise the process.</p>
<p>The Handover Was Completed Yesterday: The administration completed the handover yesterday, and because there were many files and items, it was not completed until late in the evening. The administration was officially abolished today, and the matters it handled are also being handled by the various reassigned agencies as usual from today onwards. Director Bao will now serve exclusively as the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. Most of the other personnel have been transferred by the Ministry, and only about twenty people have been given severance pay.</p>
<p>The Temporary Calculation Office Is Established Separately: The administration had a monthly turnover of tens of thousands of yuan. With this consolidation, it can earn even more surplus. The Ministry of Communications believes that the administration's accounting and other matters are quite complicated, so it has temporarily established a Shanghai-based International Report and Telephone Fee Calculation Office to handle them. Zhao Yiqing is the director, and a portion of the staff will be retained. Because the administration's lease with the Kenye Bank will not expire until the end of the year, the office will continue to operate at the original site.</p>
<h3>The Bean and Rice Industry Association Cables a Petition Regarding the Pros and Cons of Tax-Free Imported Rice</h3>
<p>Domestic rice stocks are not scarce, and there is no shortage of food. If imported rice is tax-free, it will inevitably lead to dumping.</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday cabled a petition to the Executive Yuan regarding the tax-free import of rice, stating the pros and cons. The original telegram stated: "To President Jiang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing, Recently, we have seen reports that in order to prevent a rice shortage in one area, a request has been made to issue tax-free permits to purchase imported rice. The association believes that this matter is of great importance and cannot help but express its opinions, despite the risk of causing offense. Before the imposition of taxes on imported rice, the association repeatedly appealed during the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Since the government officially ordered the implementation of the tax, the market price of domestic rice has been balanced, and the rural economy has shown signs of gradual recovery. Although a tax exemption was approved by the Relief Committee after the autumn harvest failure, it was originally intended for disaster relief and emergency needs. Civilians were not allowed to follow suit. Even if one area is short of rice now, it is not comparable to disaster relief. There is no need to exempt taxes for purchasing imported rice. If tax exemption is granted based on the request of one area, it is feared that other places will follow suit, and the discussion of dumping imported rice will reappear. If it is said that the tax exemption is limited to the local area and cannot be followed by other places, then we believe that in certain needs, private purchases should be treated the same as government purchases, otherwise, how can the prices of tax-exempt and non-tax-exempt imported rice be distinguished when they are imported at the same time? This will become a major dispute in the market. Furthermore, although there are no accurate statistics on rice production in various parts of our country, the autumn harvest last year was not poor. Although rice prices once rose, they soon fell back. From this, it can be inferred that there is no shortage of food. Even in Wenzhou and Taizhou, Zhejiang, those who are currently transporting and selling in Shanghai are continuously flowing in, and the amount of rice stored in Su, Chang, Song, and Tai is undoubtedly not small. In Shanghai, the stock is also not small. Therefore, it is not advisable to request a tax exemption and purchase imported rice at this time. Therefore, we humbly offer our humble opinions and hope that you will examine and adopt them for the benefit of the people. Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association."</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Will Implement a New System of Reporting Actual Sales and Expenses Starting Today</h3>
<p>Abolishing the Business Directors on the Yangtze River Routes and Increasing the Use of Female Inspectors, Passengers Board the Ship with Tickets</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River route vessels, including Qianzhi, Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiang'an, Jiangda, Jianguo, Kuaili, etc., will implement a new system of reporting actual sales and expenses starting today. The business directors will be abolished and replaced by administrative officers. Tea servers will be renamed service staff and will be paid monthly salaries by the company. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the administrative officers of each vessel met with General Manager Cai Zengji and General Affairs Director Wang Xiangchen to report on everything and request instructions on the allocation of staff on each vessel. Mr. Cai personally gave instructions and explained the purpose of implementing the new system, hoping that the administrative officers of each vessel would work hard in their duties and jointly seek the development of the business.</p>
<p>Shore-Based Ticketing: The company issued a notice yesterday stating that, starting from April 1st, all river vessels of the company will uniformly adopt the system of reporting actual sales and expenses. Passengers at each port, except for locations without branch offices or lighterage facilities, must first purchase tickets and board the ship with tickets. If tickets are purchased on board, a surcharge of 10% of the ticket price will be added. Passengers in this port can purchase tickets from the company's head office on the Bund, the self-established ticket office at the Jinliyuan Wharf on Xin Kaihe, or the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road to board the ship. This notice is hereby given.</p>
<p>Increased Staff: The company's newly revised regulations limit the number of personnel on each river vessel, including cargo handlers and cabin attendants, to 30 people. The administrative officers of each vessel felt that this number was insufficient, so they presented it to General Manager Cai yesterday and have already been allowed to increase the number to 40 people per vessel. At the same time, there are many female passengers on each river vessel, and it is inconvenient for men to inspect them. It is also decided to add female inspectors starting today. The number of military police stationed on the ship will also be increased to six per vessel to serve as escorts and check tickets. As for the New Life Movement instructors, they will be determined when the central government dispatches them.</p>
<p>Established Ticket Offices: Starting today, passengers on the company's vessels must board the ship with tickets. The city's ticket offices include the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company head office on the Bund, the Jinliyuan Wharf on Xin Kaihe, and the China Travel Service. Ticket prices have also been set and cannot be arbitrarily adjusted as before. The fare from Shanghai to Hankou is 19 yuan for first-class cabins, 12 yuan for passenger cabins, and 5.4 yuan for steerage. For second-class ships, the fare to Hankou is 16 yuan for officer cabins, 11 yuan for passenger cabins, and 5 yuan for steerage.</p>

The exhibition venue is located behind the Dacheng Hall of the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road. The commercial section will be postponed because temporary sheds still need to be built.

<h3>The Ministry of Industry Approves and Promulgates the Tea Inspection Standards and the Tea Box Rectification Measures Will Be Implemented at the Same Time</h3>
<p>Tea inspection, as usual, is conducted annually to determine various newly revised standards, and the Ministry of Industry instructs the Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus to implement them in accordance with the law. It is learned that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has received an order from the Ministry stipulating the new inspection standards for the 25th year of the Republic of China as follows: (A) Minimum standards for export tea: Green tea is based on Pingyong tea and No. 7 Pearl Tea, black tea is based on Hunan Qihong, and other teas are based on comparable color and aroma; The moisture content of tea should not exceed 8.5%, but this year, in addition to green tea according to the standard, black tea is qualified at 10.5%, and other teas are qualified at 12%; The ash content of tea should not exceed 7%; (B) Measures to ban colored tea: Merchants reporting colored tea must clearly fill in the name of the coloring material used, and if necessary, they may be ordered to submit the coloring material used for inspection; Tea that is excessively colored, with the same or heavier coloring standard as the established standard, is prohibited from export; The use of metals containing lead, copper, arsenic, aluminum, barium, tin, etc. (such as the commonly used light yellow San Yu Huang, Yiji Huang, and sand green, etc.) and other inorganic or organic coloring materials is prohibited from export; (C) Measures to ban tea boxes: Export tea boxes must meet the following requirements, otherwise they will be ordered to repack before export: Four wooden strips must be nailed to each of the four corners and upper and lower edges inside the box, totaling twelve strips, to increase the support of the tea box; The inner wall of the lead foil must be lined with strong, clean paper to completely isolate the tea leaves from the lead foil; The outside of the box must indicate the type of tea, trademark, (general name) number of pieces, gross weight, and net weight, (new system) production period, tea factory number, and location. It is reported that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau will strictly enforce the order after receiving it. It is also learned that the above-mentioned moisture inspection standards seem to be not much different from those of the previous year in terms of numbers, but in reality, they have increased by about 1.5%. This is because this year it has been decided to use the Hoffmann method, which is on average about 1.5% higher than the weighing method used previously. In addition, the bureau pays more attention to the measures for banning tea boxes and colored tea. In order to make inland tea merchants understand the truth about the tea box ban, the bureau has printed an explanatory booklet on improved tea boxes, describing the manufacturing method in detail and attaching photos, which will be distributed to inland tea merchants for compliance. In terms of colored tea, in addition to stipulating the highest standard for this year, the bureau has also invented many kinds of non-toxic yellow powder to replace toxic coloring materials in order to actively ban toxic coloring materials. Tea merchants raise funds to undertake the production, supervised and directed by the bureau, and the bureau orders tea merchants to apply them. However, recently inland tea merchants have still been superficially compliant and secretly resistant. Therefore, the bureau recently convened a meeting with tea merchants to discuss several methods for promoting yellow powder, which will be ordered to be used uniformly by tea merchants. If anyone violates the order and still uses toxic coloring materials, once discovered, they will also be prohibited from export. The above-mentioned measures will be implemented simultaneously when the tea season begins this year.</p>
<h3>Eight More Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrive in Shanghai, Returning Home on the Rokko and Tsukuba</h3>
<p>Shishi News Agency reports that after the overseas Chinese Chen Xunyu and Ye Yizhan arrived on the Rokko Maru the day before yesterday, they stayed at a friend's place. Yesterday, six more Chinese laborers who had been expelled from Japan, Lin Yufan, Ye Zhuren, and Zhang Shancheng (all three from Qingtian, Zhejiang), Wu Deyin (from Rui'an, Zhejiang), Jin Yushan (from Quzhou, Zhejiang), and Pan Yiyi (from Fuzhou, Fujian), were escorted by Japanese police from Tokyo to Yokohama and forced to board the Nippon Yusen Company's Tsukuba Maru. They arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday and disembarked at the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou. Five of them stayed at the Laogongxin Inn on Shiliupu, while Pan Yiyi stayed at a friend's place. Most of these overseas Chinese are members of the Kuomintang and carry a letter of introduction to the Qiaolecun Management Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission from Chen Bao'an, a standing committee member of the Executive Committee of the Tokyo Branch directly under the Chinese Kuomintang, and Tang Kaizhi, the secretary, requesting them to be introduced to work at Qiaolecun.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Legislative Yuan to Amend the Current Chamber of Commerce Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in order to urge various trade associations to improve their organizational structure and become more perfect, yesterday submitted a petition to the Legislative Yuan, suggesting amendments to various articles of the current Chamber of Commerce Law. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition to the Legislative Yuan: Regarding the matter of submitting a petition. Upon investigation of the current Chamber of Commerce Law, since it was approved by your esteemed Yuan and promulgated and implemented by the National Government, based on the practical experience of implementation over the past few years, there are still areas that need to be gradually added to or subtracted from in order to achieve greater perfection. In recent years, your esteemed Yuan, in formulating industrial and commercial laws and regulations, has extensively adopted various opinions in order to achieve the effect of both listening and observing. Based on this principle, we intend to propose suggestions regarding the points in the current Chamber of Commerce Law that are deemed necessary to be added to or subtracted from. We have compiled a separate memorandum listing the items one by one and respectfully submit this petition to your esteemed Yuan for review and approval, and to grant its implementation. This would truly be in the public interest.</p>
<p>Suggestions for Additions and Amendments: Regarding various opinions on additions and amendments to the Chamber of Commerce Law, it was originally intended to add, within Clause 7 of Article 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, matters concerning the settlement of creditor-debtor relationships. This is inherently a power granted by the Bankruptcy Law, and it seems unnecessary to add it. Because there are other laws and regulations besides the Chamber of Commerce Law that stipulate matters that the Chamber of Commerce can handle, such as the job placement in the Employment Agency Law, the creation of rejection certificates in the Negotiable Instruments Law, and so on, there are too many to list one by one in the Chamber of Commerce Law. Moreover, in reality, it is impossible to list them all. For the sake of thoroughness, it is only necessary to add one last item to Article 3: matters stipulated in other laws and regulations. It was originally intended to add, to Clause 2 of Article 13, an item about being appointed as an official. However, according to Interpretation No. 1139 of the Judicial Yuan, according to Article 10 of the Regulations on Official Service, civil servants may not engage in commerce or serve as representatives or staff of a chamber of commerce. That is, after a staff member of a chamber of commerce is appointed as an official, he will naturally resign. Other laws and regulations already have provisions for this, so there is no need to include it in this law. The reasoning is the same as above.</p>
<p>Amendment of Various Articles: Regarding the articles of the Chamber of Commerce Law proposed for amendment: Article 3. The duties of the Chamber of Commerce are as follows: To plan and discuss matters concerning the improvement and development of industry and commerce; To inquire about and report on matters concerning industry and commerce; To introduce and guide matters concerning international trade; To mediate and arbitrate matters concerning industry and commerce; To certify and authenticate matters concerning industry and commerce; To investigate and compile statistics on industry and commerce; To establish product exhibition halls, commercial schools, or other public utilities related to industry and commerce, but with the approval of the competent authorities; To have the responsibility to maintain and request the local government to maintain order in the event of market panic, etc.; To handle other matters that conform to the purposes set forth in Article 1. It is proposed to add to Clause 9 the responsibility to assist in matters concerning the organization and reorganization of trade associations, and to move the original Clause 9 to Clause 10, adding "to handle other matters that conform to the purposes set forth in Article 1, and matters stipulated in other laws and regulations." (Reason:) Trade associations are the basic organizations of the Chamber of Commerce. If the trade associations are not sound, it will indirectly affect the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce is jointly organized by various trade associations, with more concentrated manpower and resources than the trade associations. It is most appropriate to assign it the responsibility of assisting and guiding. Furthermore, there are also general provisions for matters that the Chamber of Commerce may handle as stipulated outside the Chamber of Commerce Law, such as bankruptcy settlement and job placement. Therefore, these two items are added to this article. Article 8, Paragraph 2: "The affairs of the branch offices shall be executed by the staff of the Chamber of Commerce who reside or operate within the area of the branch office." It is proposed to add the five characters "or member representatives" between the words "staff" and "of". (Reason:) In the areas of various branch offices, based on past facts, it is not necessarily the case that all staff members reside or operate there. In order to avoid obstacles, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has already approved a precedent for its flexibility. It is better to add the five characters "or member representatives" to the legal provisions so that it can be used more conveniently and handled with more basis. Article 9. The members of the Chamber of Commerce are divided into the following two types: Association members; Store members. It is proposed to add and delete as follows: Delete the word "are" from "The members of the Chamber of Commerce are divided into the following two types", and add the two characters "trade" above the four characters "association members." The second item is proposed to be changed to: "After the trade associations are legally established, they shall join the Chamber of Commerce as members. The qualifications of these members shall be eliminated due to the dissolution of the association. Before the establishment of the trade association in the industry, the store may appoint a representative to join the Chamber of Commerce as a member. The qualifications of these members shall be eliminated due to the dissolution of the store or the establishment of the trade association in the industry. Members may appoint representatives to attend the Chamber of Commerce, referred to as member representatives." (Reason:) The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce is to promote the development of the entire business community, and it should take the entire business community in an area as its organizational components so that the organization is sound and the association affairs are easy to carry out. This is the same reason why the articles of association of companies and firms are clearly stipulated in the law that they should all join the trade association. Therefore, in the second item of this article, the article "the association should join the Chamber of Commerce after its establishment" is specially added in order to consolidate the organization of the Chamber of Commerce. Also, the association is a legal person, and there is no reason to withdraw from the Chamber of Commerce except for dissolution. Therefore, this article adds this article in the third item to prevent the abuse of free withdrawal from the association. When there are more than seven stores, a trade association can be organized. Therefore, the scope of the store members of the Chamber of Commerce is narrow, and the time is also temporary. It is not necessary to restrict its freedom to join the association. Therefore, this article has the provisions of the fourth item. Article 18. The executive committee members and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce shall be elected by the general meeting of members from among the member representatives. The number of executive committee members shall not exceed fifteen, and the number of supervisory committee members shall not exceed seven. It is proposed to change it to: The number of executive committee members shall not exceed forty-five, and the number of supervisory committee members shall not exceed twenty-one. (Reason:) The executive committee members are entrusted by the general meeting of members and bear the important responsibility of the development of the entire business community. It is necessary to recruit the backbone members of various industries to be jointly responsible in order to adapt to the needs of the business community in the city and county and strive for development. The current Chamber of Commerce Law has reduced the number of directors by more than half compared to the old system of the fourth year of the Republic of China, which is really not enough to meet the needs of the environment, resulting in a lack of candidates when organizing the sub-committee, and had to recruit from outside the executive committee. Therefore, this article intends to increase the number of committee members as left. Article 22. If a committee member has one of the following circumstances, he shall be dismissed immediately: With the approval of the general meeting of members due to unavoidable reasons, he is allowed to resign; Absent from duty and ordered to resign by the general meeting of members; In his duties, he goes against laws and regulations for personal gain, engages in malpractice, or has other major improper acts, and is ordered to resign by the general meeting of members, or ordered to resign by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or the highest local administrative agency; It is proposed to change the five characters "or by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce" in the third item to "or by the Ministry of Industry," and to change the fourth item to: "If one of the circumstances in Article 13 and Article 16 occurs." (Reason:) According to the original text of Article 16 of this law, the phrase "member representative loses nationality" cannot be included in the various doubts in Article 13. Therefore, the four characters "Article 16" are added to the fourth item of this article, etc.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Public Sharing: China Merchants Sanpei Breaks Historical Record</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route, China Merchants, Sanpei, Taikoo, and Ning-Shao, have allied to share profits, China Merchants and Sanpei have been allocated profits by Taikoo and Ning-Shao every year. However, the situation was very different last year, reversing the historical record. Sanpei and China Merchants allocated profits to the other two. This is truly a good phenomenon for Chinese ships. The details of the publicly shared profits on the route, which have been announced, are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Total Revenue</p>
<p>Last year, the total freight revenue from cargo transportation on the Shanghai-Ningbo route was 493,088.94 yuan. This is the actual net amount, after deducting the 25% commission. Among this total amount, the China Merchants Bureau's Xinjiangtian ship accounted for 128,958.92 yuan, the Sanpei Company's Ningxing ship accounted for 128,193.76 yuan, the Ning-Shao's Ning-Shao ship accounted for 121,856.10 yuan, and the British Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing accounted for 140,800.15 yuan.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Change</p>
<p>According to the public sharing in previous years, the British Taikoo Company has always ranked first on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, Ning-Shao ranked second, and Sanpei and China Merchants have never reached the required amount. Last year, the China Merchants Bureau underwent a vigorous reorganization by Liu Hongsheng, and cargo transportation suddenly increased. The Sanpei Company also benefited from the exemption of transit taxes for goods at Zhenhai Port, resulting in the largest amount of loading and unloading. This port collected 50,000 yuan in freight revenue for the year. Ning-Shao and Taikoo, due to not stopping at Zhenhai, fell to the third and fourth places, breaking the historical record and turning into a situation where Taikoo and Ning-Shao were allocated profits.</p>
<p>Amount of Public Sharing</p>
<p>Taikoo Company has now concluded that the public sharing amount for the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo route last year is that the Sanpei Company's income has exceeded the prescribed amount and should allocate 9,736.28 yuan of freight revenue. The China Merchants Bureau has also experienced a sharp increase in the income of Xinjiangtian and should also allocate 7,788.35 yuan. The Taikoo Company, due to insufficient freight revenue, should be allocated 11,179.11 yuan. The Ning-Shao Company should also be allocated 6,345.49 yuan. Yesterday, the companies that should allocate funds were asked to pay the amount to be allocated to the allocated companies for accounting. Because it broke the historical record, it is specially noted.</p>
<h3>Both Railways Allocate Interest on Advance Payments for Vehicle Purchases</h3>
<p>6,600 Pounds Equivalent to More Than 100,000 National Currency</p>
<p>The interest owed by the Jinpu Railway to the British and Chinese Bank for the advance payment for vehicle purchases, ending at the end of March of this year, is still 6,600 pounds. The accounting office of both railway bureaus converted it to 109,477.32 yuan of national currency at an exchange rate of one shilling and two and thirty-two fifteenths pence, and transferred the full amount to HSBC a few days ago for remittance to London.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables to Correct the Confiscation of Silver Coins by Public Officials</h3>
<p>Within the Period Permitted for Exchange for Legal Tender</p>
<p>People Holding Silver Dollars is Not Illegal</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, Nanjing. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, esteemed sirs: On March 30, a letter was received from Liu Zhonghong, a merchant residing at Jiang Jushenghao in Yichang College Street, stating that he is a native of Wanxian, Sichuan, and operates a machine-made noodle business. He came to Yichang on March 11 to purchase flour. At that time, the price of flour rose sharply, which was not cost-effective. He was preparing to return to Wanxian by boat when he heard people on the street say that the Sichuan Provincial Bank exchanged silver dollars for legal tender and could get a bonus. The reason for the bank's bonus for receiving silver dollars was that 60% of the silver dollars could be exchanged for 40% of the official price, and 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged. Therefore, people from far and near went to the bank to exchange for legal tender. After hearing this, Liu thought that if he exchanged silver dollars for legal tender at the bank on his way back to Sichuan, he could promote the bank's success in compensating public bonds and make up for this payment. He did not know that this was an act of violating the ban. Therefore, he entrusted his friend Lin Wencheng to exchange 600 yuan of silver dollars and carried them back to the inn. The innkeeper Li Guangxiang told him that carrying silver dollars on the boat was against the ban and would be confiscated by the customs if discovered. After hearing this, Liu regretted his recklessness and returned the original silver dollars to Lin Wencheng's house to exchange them back for legal tender. Lin said that the silver dollars were exchanged from various places in small amounts, and it was really troublesome to return them. If he wanted legal tender, he would exchange it at the bank tomorrow, but Liu had to bear the subsidy and handling fees. While the two parties were arguing, several soldiers suddenly came and sent Liu and the silver dollars to the Yichang Local Court. Soon after, the court's indictment stated that Liu was suspected of violating Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Hindering National Currency. The silver dollars in the case were confiscated in accordance with Article 38, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Liu initially did not know and planned to exchange silver dollars for legal tender in Sichuan. Later, he knew that it was against the ban and still returned the silver dollars. This situation cannot be considered a criminal suspicion of hindering national currency. It was also heard that your association had drafted articles on the export of silver and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. For the silver dollars seized in the home, they can only be exchanged for legal tender and cannot be confiscated, which has been approved by the ministry. If this is true, then the silver dollars of the people were seized in Lin Wencheng's house. The court can only exchange them for legal tender and cannot confiscate them. In addition to submitting a petition to the local court to apply for the return of legal tender, we should also send a letter to your association to uphold justice and provide assistance. Upon arrival at the meeting, it was found that the period for the people to hold silver dollars and exchange them for legal tender was opened. On January 21 of this year, we received a telegram from your (Finance) Ministry Qianzi No. 5483, extending the period to May 3, 1936. It was also found that on November 18 of last year, we received a telegram from your (Finance) Ministry Xian, promulgating eight articles on the method of exchanging legal tender. In Article 6, there is also the phrase "those who take advantage of the exchange period to blackmail silver coin holders shall be punished for fraud." It is during the period when it is convenient to exchange silver dollars for legal tender, and it is not illegal for the people to hold silver dollars and is protected by laws and regulations. Searches by soldiers and confiscations by the court are not permitted by national laws and regulations. According to the previous situation in the letter, public officials in various places have failed to thoroughly study the administrative orders issued by the country, resulting in hasty handling and many mistakes, which are detrimental to the currency policy and the future of the rule of law. They should be telegraphed to your ministry for review and approval and given a general order to correct them so that the people will not be wronged. This is truly in the public interest. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bowed on the 30th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Waterworks Company Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Water Prices Will Likely Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company held its annual meeting on Sunday (March 30). According to Chairman Li Deli, the company's net profit from contracts with water users last year was 1,747,216 yuan, a decrease of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The net profit from extra contracts with ships was 103,498 yuan. He also said that according to the contract between the company and the Shanghai Municipal Council, the company could increase water fees. However, for the benefit of the residents, the company announced in November last year that it would postpone the fee increase for one year. Now, if the exchange rate falls, the result will eventually have to be increased. This is obvious. The supply of tap water in the western area of the Public Concession has not yet been agreed upon, which is regrettable. The company cannot supply water to new users in the area until the negotiations are completed satisfactorily. His report was very long, detailing the operating conditions of the year and mentioning the company's losses in converting income into pounds sterling after the Chinese government changed to using legal tender. After Li read the report, the meeting unanimously passed resolutions such as the issuance of dividends and adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wenxi Paper Mill: Experimental Raw Materials Show Excellent Results</h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the Wenxi Paper Mill has been preparing for a long time, and the request to allocate 600,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity as start-up funds has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is said that the factory has conducted detailed research on papermaking technology and raw materials and has gained a lot of experience. The precious fir and willow fir, which are the raw materials for papermaking, have been tested by the Central Industrial Research Institute and have very good fibers, especially the precious fir, which is very suitable for manufacturing newsprint. It is also heard that the factory plans to transport the raw materials to the United States for further testing.</p>

According to news from the Bond Redemption and Exchange Office, the bond exchange time is still from 9:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. However, due to the large amount of bonds involved this time, for the sake of simplifying procedures, the exchange should be completed within five days. All Type A and Type B bonds that have not yet been exchanged will be exchanged as usual starting on the 6th. It is heard that the handling of the exchange is very complicated, so the office must work until late at night every day to complete it. The term of the Type C bonds is 18 years, and the principal will be redeemed by lottery starting on July 31 of this year. The first phase of principal redemption is 750,000 yuan, and the interest payment is 4.5 million yuan.</p>

Mr. Sampson and others witnessed the agility of the movements and admired them very much. The speed of work was no less than that of European and American countries. They raised champagne to celebrate, took a photo together to commemorate the occasion, and parted happily. Later, they toured Hun Shen to Longhua Temple, the Old City God Temple, and other places before returning to their country by ship.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Adds Extra Buses</h3>

<h3>Taxi Driver's Union Asks Customers Not to Reduce Tips</h3>
<p>The Taxi Driver's Union issued a notice to all sectors of society yesterday, saying: Dear sirs, recently, taxi companies in the city, in order to develop business and attract customers, have been using radio broadcasts or advertisements in newspapers to ask customers to reduce tips. At this time of economic depression and the decline of various industries, it is certainly unavoidable for taxi companies to take care of their business, but the plight of the drivers must be appealed to. According to the drivers, the monthly wage is only about 20 yuan. If they take leave, they will be deducted according to the hour. They work day and night, and eat four meals a day, costing 20 cents each. The income is not enough to cover the expenses. Not to mention clothing and housing, and the drivers have a great responsibility. For example, if the car body is damaged, they should be responsible for compensation. Moreover, the traffic regulations are becoming increasingly strict. If they are not careful, they will violate the regulations, and the fines are often around 10 yuan. At present, Shanghai is declining and the cost of living is high. Maintaining a family depends entirely on tips to supplement income. Therefore, the members of the union are very panicked when they hear the news. They have been asking for help, and requests have been pouring in. The union's responsibility lies in not being silent. Therefore, the reasons are stated in detail, and the public is requested to take a taxi to consider the situation and still give generous tips according to the usual practice. The cost is not much for the public, but the drivers will benefit a lot. Moreover, the safety of passengers depends on the drivers' stable life to fulfill their duties.</p>
<h3>Donations from All Sectors for Purchasing an Airplane to Celebrate a Birthday</h3>

Furthermore, initiators of the committee continued to receive agreement from leading figures from all walks of life, including Huang Jinrong, Song ZiLiang, Qu Yingguang, Li Mulian, Gu Yuqi, Wang Simo, Mao Heyuan, and Fu Zuoheng, as well as organizations such as the Shanghai Eleventh District Education Association of the Guangdong Fellow Association. It is reported that the committee plans to expand its strength and solicit initiators from banks, major companies, shops, guilds, and labor unions throughout the city. The office of the China Aviation Association's Chief Captain received a further 22 yuan in membership fees from Weng Zhilong, the leader of the twentieth soliciting team, and 122 yuan in membership fees from Zhou Shenxiu, the leader of the 309th team.

<h3>Moore Memorial Church Holds Infant Hygiene Competition Yesterday</h3>
<p>Many Participants</p>
<p>The Health Department of Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road, in order to promote infant hygiene, held an infant hygiene competition in the church from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM yesterday. Many doctors and nurses were hired to examine the infants' health. At one point, over two hundred infants, both male and female, large and small, were brought by their parents to participate in the competition. After the examination, the church gave each child a beautiful picture card, and the candy and food company provided refreshments. Therefore, all the children were overjoyed, and the female staff of the church provided attentive service, so the parents were also quite satisfied. It is reported that the results of the competition will be announced at the infant fun fair on the 11th of this month, and prizes will be awarded.</p>
<h3>New Life Sanitation Movement in Pudong</h3>
<p>The Pudong Public Security Bureau, Yangjing District Security Regiment, Pudong YMCA, Pudong Hospital, and other agencies and groups recently jointly organized an expanded New Life Sanitation Movement in Pudong. In addition to the police and security regiment members, students from various schools also participated, holding brooms and dustpans every day, sweeping the streets and alleys, and clearing all the newspapers from the walls, presenting a brand-new atmosphere. Furthermore, because there were too many stalls set up along the streets, which not only detracted from the appearance but also caused considerable inconvenience to traffic, over ten acres of vacant land at the old ice factory in Dongchang Road, near the city center, were borrowed and divided into routes. All the stalls were persuaded to move there and concentrate. As a result of this move, there were no more stalls on the roads and sidewalks, which greatly benefited traffic, and customers only needed to go to one place to choose and buy goods, which was much more convenient than before.</p>

<h3>Zheng Mengxia, Who Won the Dance Competition, Is Accused in Two Cases</h3>
<p>1.  Yuchang Leather Goods Store Accuses Her of Issuing Bad Checks</p>
<p>2.  Actor Guan Hongbin Sues for Breach of Contract</p>
<p>Zheng Mengxia, a woman from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, is skilled in dance, Peking opera, and singing. In 1934, RCA Shengke Company held a dance competition, which Zheng and her friend Chen Gaocong also participated in. As a result, Zheng was selected as the champion, and Zheng's reputation soared. Later, Zheng and Chen went to Tianjin to perform dance, and had been away from the scene for a long time. Last winter, Zheng suddenly returned to Shanghai and was hired by the Dahua Dance Hall to perform various dances. Soon after, Zheng and Dahua made a contract to perform as a dance partner. Before a month had passed, Zheng was invited by Tianchan Dance Theater to perform Peking opera. Now, Zheng was sued by He Ruizhi for issuing bad checks, and Guan Hongbin sued for breach of contract in the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court opened a hearing to summon her. The details of the trial are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Issuing Bad Checks: Last year, Zheng ordered clothes from Yunshang Company and paid with a check from the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank dated February 28 of this year, totaling 80 yuan. At that time, Yunshang Company transferred the check to Yuchang Leather Goods Store, which had business dealings with them. Upon maturity, the store was unable to cash the check and repeatedly demanded payment from Zheng, who ignored them. He Ruizhi, the manager of Yuchang Leather Goods Store, then hired lawyer Wang Xintang to file a criminal complaint of issuing bad checks with the First Special Court, requesting severe punishment in accordance with Article 146 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. The Special Court issued a summons and sent it to Tianchan Dance Theater at 701 Fuzhou Road, where Zheng personally signed for it. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Qianchang opened the Fifth Criminal Court for questioning, but Zheng did not appear. Plaintiff Wang lawyer stated the facts and requested that, since the defendant had legally received the summons but did not appear, she should be sentenced in accordance with Article 298 of the Criminal Procedure Law without waiting for her statement. Judge Yang approved the request and declared the verdict: Zheng Mengxia deliberately issued a check exceeding her deposit, and was fined 20 yuan. If she defaults, she will serve one day of labor service for every two yuan.</p>
<p>Breach of Contract: In October 1934, Zheng Mengxia was introduced by Li Hongkui to apprentice with veteran actor Guan Hongbin to learn Peking opera. At that time, it was agreed that if Zheng performed in a troupe within five years, the income would be split 80/20, with Guan receiving 20%. Zheng has been hired by Tianchan Dance Theater, with a monthly salary of 800 yuan. For several months, Zheng did not pay Guan Hongbin 20% of her salary as agreed. Guan repeatedly demanded payment, but Zheng consistently delayed. Guan then hired lawyer Yao Junyu to file a request for civil mediation with the First Special Court, requesting that Zheng be ordered to pay the petitioner 20% of the salary she has received since joining the troupe, as agreed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Jiantang opened the Eleventh Civil Court for mediation, but Zheng did not attend, so mediation was impossible. Judge Zhou declared the mediation unsuccessful and ordered a formal lawsuit to be filed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Man Swindles Hongkang Money Shop</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, at 3:00 PM on the 28th of last month, four Japanese men, Kuwakawa Kenichi, Kakiguchi Masasumi, Kakiguchi Shizakiro, and Fujiki Ken, at Room 433, 4th floor, Xinya Hotel, North Sichuan Road, falsely claimed to exchange Japanese gold at the Hongkang Exchange Shop at 336 Wusong Road. The shop sent clerks Feng Chaoliang and Xu Ligong to Xinya, unaware that the criminals would swindle 1,000 yuan of Japanese gold. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Consulate General made great efforts to search in all directions. Late at night on the 30th, Kakiguchi Masasumi was seen by a criminal investigator at a coffee shop on Zhaopu Road and arrested. The accomplice, Kuwakawa, had previously been involved in a kidnapping case at a hospital and was skilled in boxing. He had previously lived in the Qiukou Grand Hotel and later moved to the Xinya Hotel. He received 800 yuan of the loot. Previously, he had also swindled several hundred yuan in Japan and fled to Taiwan, where he lived freely for several months. Recently, he came to Shanghai by ship. One day, when he was staying at the Hongkou Dafang Society, he saw Hongkang shop clerks carrying 2,000 yuan in cash and attempted to rob them. Later, because the resistance was unsuccessful, he changed into Chinese clothes and moved to the Xinya Hotel. After receiving the loot, he took a female waitress from a coffee shop to Suzhou for sightseeing and spent more than 160 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bloody Incident in a Battle with Poachers: Three Bodies Examined Yesterday, Two Robbers and a Tea Room Attendant Died</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM the night before last, three robbers broke into Li Yongchang Clock Shop on Fuzhou Road, and two of them with handguns robbed 20 yuan in banknotes and small bills. They attempted to escape, but were spotted by detectives No. 164 and No. 237 of the Old Gate Police Station. One robber was shot dead on the spot in front of the shop, and the police station was immediately notified to send a large number of detectives to round up the two fleeing robbers. Subsequently, a shootout occurred between the two sides at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Hubei Road, resulting in the deaths and injuries of over ten people from bullets hitting robbers, police, and passersby. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspapers. It is now learned that the robber killed on the spot was found with the stolen 20 yuan in banknotes. His name is unknown, and he was not holding a handgun. Another robber, named Wang Yucai, 45 years old, from Zhenjiang, died at the Patrolmen's Hospital at 1:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Jiang Road Murder Case: Fang Jinwen Also Died Yesterday, Former Lover Stabs Later Lover, Murderer Leaves Behind One Bullet Casing</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 PM the night before last, a bloody incident occurred on the upper floor of No. 28 Hantai Lane, at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Song Park Road in Zhabei. A man and a woman were both sent to the Renji Hospital in the Concession. The woman, Fang Peng, died en route, and the man, Fang Jinwen, also died yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident: Fang Peng, 26 years old, from Liyang, had previously been in a relationship with a member of the Zhabei Security Corps, No. 1371, known as someone. Recently, because she felt that the someone's income was not abundant, she secretly had an affair with Fang Jinwen from Shaoxing, and therefore changed her name to Fang Peng. On the 28th of last month, she rented the upper floor of No. 28 Hantai Lane, at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Song Park Road, and cohabited with Fang.</p>
<p>Sudden Murder: The matter was discovered by someone, who went to negotiate on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Fang refused to yield because they were not formally married. Someone became jealous and gathered four or five people, carrying handguns, axes, sharp knives, etc., and broke in through the back door at around 11:00 PM that evening. Fang and Peng were already asleep. Someone was furious at the sight and first chopped Peng more than ten times with an axe. Fang tried to help Peng, and was also chopped several times. Then someone fired two shots, one hitting Fang's stomach. The murderers then left together and fled.</p>
<p>Report to the Police for Investigation</p>
<p>The incident was immediately reported to Police Officer No. 11 of the Yongxing Road Police Station at the scene for investigation. An ambulance was immediately called to send the man and woman to the Renji Hospital in the Concession for treatment. Peng's injuries were severe, and she died on arrival at the hospital. Fang Jinwen also died of excessive blood loss at around 11:00 AM yesterday. The hospital immediately notified the Yongxing Road Police Station by telephone, instructing the local bailiff Wang Shaoting to report to the Shanghai Local Court for inspection. At around 4:00 PM in the afternoon, police officer Kong Xianglin arrived at the scene to investigate and instructed the bailiff to arrange for the collection of the body first, and to investigate and arrest the murderers. The Yongxing Police Station has reported the situation to the Inspectorate of the Public Security Bureau and recovered a bullet casing left behind when the murderers opened fire.</p>
<h3>Bullet Doesn't Match Gun: Robber Fails to Fire, Worker Injured by Gun Butt While Capturing Robber, Robber Sent to Court Yesterday for Questioning</h3>
<p>Fan Amao from Jiangwan has been working as a gatekeeper and rent collector in Wenchang Lane, at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road. His family lives on the upper floor of a cross-street building at No. 1 Lane. At 7:20 PM the night before last, Fan returned home after collecting 86 yuan in rent. Unexpectedly, while he was having dinner, four robbers led by Yang Linsheng broke in, brandishing handguns and threatening to make a noise. They pried open the drawer and took the rent money of 86 yuan and a pair of gold earrings and a gold hairpin worn by Fan's mother-in-law, totaling 166 yuan. They carried the loot downstairs and fled in different directions. Fan Amao identified Yang Linsheng as the robber holding the gun and chased him, shouting loudly. His neighbors, who happened to be from a foundry, heard the alarm and helped chase him to the intersection of Peng Road and North Zhejiang Road. Yang was grabbed by Zhou Guangshan, who struggled desperately and struck Zhou on the head with the butt of the gun, causing him to be injured and bleed profusely. The gun butt was also covered in blood. At that time, two detectives, No. 1068 and No. 29212, arrived to assist and took Yang and the handgun and three bullets to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Zhou Guangshan was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station sent him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court and filed a public prosecution for robbery in accordance with Article 330 of the Criminal Law. He also stated that the defendant admitted in the police station yesterday that the case was initiated by Yao Liufu, who is still at large, and went with two unknown persons on the pretext of searching for opium soil to commit the robbery. Later, when the defendant was held by Zhou Guangshan, he still resisted by hitting him with the butt of the gun. However, it was found after the fact that the stolen goods had been taken away by his accomplices. One bullet in the gun was stuck. The police detectives also found two bullets in the gutter on the side of the road. After examining the bullets and the handgun, the police station found that the size of the bullets did not match the gun barrel and could not be fired. Therefore, the defendant only used the butt of the gun to resist at the time, and the reason for not firing was probably because of this. Now, because his accomplices are at large, he requested permission for a postponement and presented the handgun as evidence. According to Fan Amao and the witness Zhou Guangshan, they testified that the defendant and the three others who were at large had come to rob and described the chase. Judge Wu then reviewed the confession and ordered Yang to be detained for questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Person Robbed at Qipu Road Intersection, Total of 800 Yuan in Cash and Checks Stolen</h3>
<p>The area around the intersection of Qipu Road and Gansu Road in the Public Concession has always been very quiet. There are very few pedestrians passing by every morning and evening. Unlawful elements take advantage of this to rob people. A man passed by the intersection of Qipu Road and Gansu Road alone. The man was well-dressed, like a shop assistant. He was walking in a hurry, as if he had something important to do. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly blocked by three thugs who jumped out of the darkness at the intersection. Two of the thugs pointed guns at him and threatened him. The thugs searched his body by hand. The man was unable to escape and unable to avoid it. He had no choice but to let the robbers undress him and search all his pockets, taking 500 yuan in cash and a check for 300 yuan. The robbers then shouted and fled from the side road. The man shouted for help, but by the time the police arrived, it was too late. He immediately went with them to report to the police station in charge and requested to be tracked down. It is said that the stolen items were all public funds.</p>

<h3>Tea Boy Wrongfully Accused of Theft, Angered and Commits Suicide by Poison, Yang Bingsen Dies Unjustly</h3>
<p>Yang Zigeng, a 54-year-old native of Anhui, had been working as a dockside greeter at the Guangtailai Hotel, No. 107 Edward Road, for over ten years. His son, Yang Bingsen, 25 years old, had also been a tea boy at the hotel for six years. Recently, the hotel changed owners, and some of the older tea boys were replaced by new ones. This led to friction and disagreements between the old and new factions. A few days ago, Yu Fengjia, a 31-year-old accountant from Songjiang working at the hotel, reported the theft of a pair of leather shoes. Fan Changxi, a 32-year-old new tea boy from Yangzhou, falsely accused Yang Bingsen of stealing Yu's shoes to the head accountant. Yang's father learned of this and severely scolded Bingsen. Bingsen, feeling unjustly accused of theft, his reputation ruined, and unable to clear his name, became despondent. He committed suicide by secretly ingesting poison in his room at the hotel on the afternoon of the 30th of last month at 2 PM. At around 5 PM, his colleagues discovered Bingsen with a pale face and frothing at the mouth. They reported this to the accountant and informed his father. He was rushed to Renji Hospital. However, the poison had already taken deep effect, and he could not be saved. He died at 12:30 AM yesterday. The hospital reported this to the French Concession Police Department, who ordered an investigation. Meanwhile, the body was moved by relatives to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, Investigator Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, along with a coroner and clerk, arrived at the parlor. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased had died from poisoning before death. The official interrogated the deceased's father and witnesses and then instructed the father to sign a statement and claim the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Wang Zidan Arrested in Bathhouse for Alleged Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Wang Zidan, a native of Zhenjiang, residing at No. 5 Maoyi Lane, Shanhai Guan Road, worked as a broker. On September 3rd of last year, Wang ordered 82 barrels of egg yolk, valued at over 6,900 yuan, from Song Zigang, the Chinese manager of the German firm Lihe Foreign Company. He instructed the goods to be delivered to the Meizuishi Foreign Company, which Song did. However, after several days, Song requested payment from Wang, but Wang initially evaded the issue and then avoided meeting him altogether. An investigation revealed that the Meizuishi Foreign Company had paid for the goods immediately upon receiving them. Therefore, the funds were embezzled by Wang. Song reported this to the General Police Department, and Detective Gao Zhen was instructed to investigate. Because Wang's whereabouts were unknown, he could not be apprehended. It was not until the 27th of the month that Wang was arrested in the Huaqingchi Bathhouse on Hankou Road. He was handed over to the First Special District Court for questioning, and the case was postponed. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the trial in the Second Criminal Division. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, charged him with embezzlement under Article 335 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, Song Zigang filed a case, explaining his transaction with Wang and his repeated evasions. Zheng, an employee of the Meizuishi Foreign Company, testified that 82 barrels of egg yolk were indeed received and that 5,400 foreign dollars were paid to the defendant upon delivery. When questioned, Wang Zidan admitted that he had not paid the plaintiff, but claimed that because of their past dealings, it could not be considered embezzlement. He hired lawyers Ling Qihong and Li Baosen for his defense. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Zhan ordered the case to be adjourned and scheduled the verdict to be announced next Friday. Wang Zidan was ordered to provide a 5,000 yuan shop guarantee.</p>

<h3>Fire at Zhou Baochang Knife and Iron Shop on Meige Road</h3>
<p>Zhou Baochang Knife and Iron Shop is located at No. 554 Meige Road, the intersection of Xin Zha Road. The back door of the shop faces No. 546 Meige Road, Yongshou Lane. In addition to selling knives, hoes, and other items, the shop also sold fuel such as rice straw. However, the inside of the shop was narrow and there was no place to store them. A corrugated iron awning was built at the back door for storing rice straw. There were several hundred bundles of rice straw. Unexpectedly, around 9 PM yesterday, the rice straw pile suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. White smoke filled the air, and it threatened to spread. Fortunately, neighbors noticed and immediately blew whistles to alert the nearby guards and informed the fire brigade of Avenue Edward VII, who dispatched fire engines to extinguish the fire.

<h3>Elderly Woman Commits Indecency, Pretending to Be Mother and Son with Young Man</h3>
<p>The Elderly Woman is Extremely Shameless</p>
<p>Xu Fuchun, a native of Ningbo, nearing sixty years of age, has been working as a cook at the Zhao Changbei Goods Store in Taiping Lane, Nanshi. He lives at No. 1, Lane 63, Dama Tou. Eight years ago, his wife died of illness, and he felt quite lonely. Through matchmaking, he remarried a widow, Ms. Yin (46 years old), from the same hometown. The couple's relationship was initially harmonious. However, Ms. Yin was naturally promiscuous and secretly became involved with Fu Xianggen (26 years old). Because she felt it was inconvenient to meet him secretly, she falsely told Xu Fuchun that Fu Xianggen was a "foster son" and invited him to live with them. Xu Fuchun was extraordinarily weak and obedient to his wife, so the adulterous couple was unscrupulous and inseparable, and their scandalous behavior spread far and wide. At 11 PM the night before last, Xu Fuchun returned home from outside and saw the adulterous couple naked in the same bed. Xu remained silent and immediately went outside to call the police. He ordered the man and woman to put on their clothes and took them to the 16th Bureau. It was found that the woman, nearing fifty, was still involved with a young man, pretending to be mother and son, which was extremely shameless. Moreover, as she was married, her affair was a violation of the law. A formal document was prepared and submitted to the Public Security Bureau, which was then forwarded to the District Court for investigation. After an investigation by Prosecutor Li Fen, they were ordered to be detained separately pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Huang Zhongming Invents Standard Running Script</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Zhongming, secretary of the Commercial Press, is a keen researcher of calligraphy. Recently, he noted that regular script (楷書) is overly cumbersome and in urgent need of improvement. He also observed that people in all walks of life have long been using running script (行書). Therefore, he considered replacing regular script with running script, following the precedent of past character transformations, as a comprehensive improvement plan. He thoroughly reorganized running script, defined standards, and strived for simplicity, advocating two major principles: 1. Simple and easy to recognize; 2. Standardization of running script. He gathered the strengths of many, incorporated new ideas, was not bound by the ancients, and suited the present. After a long period of research and experimentation, he wrote "A Study of Standard Running Script." The preface, examples, and standard tables are all written by Mr. Huang in standard running script and printed for correction by scholars. Those interested in research can write to Mr. Huang. Mr. Huang plans to collect opinions from all parties and then revise it further, hoping for completion. This is truly an important plan for reforming the written language. The preface and examples are recorded below. The full text of the standard table is published in the special spring issue of "Eastern Miscellany," Volume 33, published on the first of this month. The origin of the standard running script is as follows: I have often studied the changes in writing, which mostly tend from complex to simple, and from difficult to easy. From seal script (籀篆) to cursive script (草書), the time span is less than a thousand years, but the changes in font are vast, with a large difference between complex and simple. I deeply admire the greatness of the ancients' creative spirit and the rapid pace of improvement. In the past, Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty ordered that memorials be submitted in cursive script. Today, we still use regular script. Emperor Zhang is more than 1,800 years away from us. Today's affairs are a hundred or a thousand times more complex than in the Han Dynasty, and the complexity of regular script is ten times more than that of cursive script. Common characters in regular script have as many as thirty strokes or more. It is undoubtedly unsuitable for today's needs. Is this why our culture is difficult to advance and easy to regress? Therefore, in recent years, the voices for reforming the written language have been clamorous, and there are even those who advocate abolishing Chinese characters altogether. From this, we know that the current regular script is indeed in a trend that cannot but be changed. If it remains unchanged, our written language may not be preserved. Knowing that there is a need to reform the written language, I also considered the path to reform and the overall reform plan, and the following thoughts arose: The simplification of writing has reached its limit with cursive script. Liu Desheng of the Later Han Dynasty then created running script, because he saw that regular script was too complex and cursive script was too simple and difficult to distinguish. Therefore, he had to create this balanced creation. Easy to write and easy to recognize are the most practical needs of today. Nothing is better than running script. However, Liu Desheng's running script is not available. Those skilled in running script mostly wield their pens freely, each following their own intentions, resulting in a mixture of regular and cursive scripts, with no fixed standards for strokes and parts. If running script is reorganized and standardized, it seems to be the quickest way to reform the written language. Any reform must be guided by the trend to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Although regular script is still commonly used, in fact, all applied writing in all fields, except for a very small number who are bound by habit and believe that special respect should be shown, universally use running script. Only because there is no fixed standard, it still cannot completely replace regular script. If each character of running script is reorganized, related ones simplified, and non-standard ones unified, it seems simple and easy to implement. Today's affairs are so complex, there are so many subjects of study, books use regular script, writing in daily life uses running script, and what requires respect must use regular script. One must learn two or more forms of characters at the same time, what could be more inconvenient? If running script is used to replace regular script, so that the writing in books and the writing in daily life are combined into one, students can save brainpower and time, and our written language will have a unified appearance. In the future, regular script will be viewed like seal script and clerical script today, reserved for experts to study. A country's written language is the spirit of the nation, and is of great importance. Its reform must have a comprehensive plan and a consistent direction. The change from seal script to clerical script, the change from clerical script to regular script, were all overall reforms, not partial transformations. Today's reform of the written language should first determine the overall plan, and then study each character, and test each character, so that the change does not depart from the origin, and is simple and easy to recognize. Our written language has gradually increased over thousands of years due to the evolution of things, and the forms vary due to differences in people and places, resulting in several forms for characters with the same sound and meaning. A study of Han and Wei inscriptions often shows this, following habits and continuing to this day. Words like 窗牕, 察詧, 雁鴈, 虬蚪 are too numerous to list. Random writing dazzles the eyes. It seems appropriate to reorganize each one, carefully consider what to keep and what to discard. Accumulating the above feelings, dwelling in the chest, repeatedly considering, I believe that our written language must be thoroughly reorganized based on running script. Taking eight tenths of the running script that can be simplified, and referring to two tenths of the cursive script, with easy recognition as the scope, first set the standard for the parts of each character, and then study each character, all composed according to the standard, and named "Standard Running Script." The principles are: 1. Simple and easy to recognize: The shape of each character should be as close as possible to the regular script, so that those who already know the characters can recognize them at a glance, without the pain of re-learning characters. Those who directly recognize and read standard running script can still read all existing books. 2. Standardization of running script: Our written language is composed of various parts. The same parts of each character are universally used, which has a scientific spirit. This is our beautiful culture, and should be preserved as much as possible. The parts of standard running script are all based on the prescribed standards, so that each is completely connected, and easy-to-recognize parts of cursive script are also adopted, in order to simplify it. It combines the strengths of regular script, running script, and cursive script into one. Based on this principle, more than 8,000 characters have been composed according to the example. Each character is made to be recognized by children of seven or eight years old. If they encounter a character they have recognized but do not recognize, change it until they can recognize it. For characters that have not been recognized, then make students of sixteen or seventeen years old recognize them. If they encounter a character they have recognized but do not recognize, change it again, until they can recognize it. If the standard cannot be applied, change the standard as well. After this long period of research and experimentation, it seems that there are no major obstacles. However, this matter is of great importance, and one person's knowledge is limited. Making a cart behind closed doors may not always fit the rut. Public research and discussion can broaden benefits and gather ideas. Therefore, I describe its origin, list its examples, and list the standards below, for correction by the wise. I hope you will not hesitate to give advice, to correct mistakes, and to strive for completion. This can help promote culture, and also preserve one aspect of our inherent culture.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>After reading the newspapers on March 28, they contained a description of the thief Jiang Siwen (also known as Ah Chao), 27 years old, from Changzhou, who had participated in the group wedding ceremony in this city in January of this year with his wife Sun Xiuying. After investigation, there was no group wedding ceremony held in this city in January. After searching through the past wedding registration lists, there was also no Jiang Siwen (or Ah Chao) and Sun Xiuying. Although there were women with the same name among the women who participated in the wedding, their ages and origins were different, and the man who married was the cashier of a famous bank in this city, and is still working at the bank, and there is no possibility of involvement. Because I am afraid that the rumors are untrue, I hereby send a letter to your newspaper to correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, March 31.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Woolen Industry</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 20)</p>
<p>The woolen industry mentioned in this article includes manufacturing and sales. However, woolen is a higher-grade industrial product, and has always been imported from overseas. To this day, imported products are still the mainstay. Therefore, this article focuses on the woolen sales industry, and its manufacturing industry is only mentioned incidentally.</p>
<h3>1. Evolution of the Woolen Sales Industry</h3>
<p>Shanghai was the earliest place in China to have a woolen sales industry, and it has been more than 60 years since then. At the beginning of the industry, it was operated by Western-style tailors (commonly known as Hongbang tailors) as a sideline, and the scale was very small. The goods they distributed were mostly used to supply customers for tailoring clothes, so that each time they only bought a few yards from foreign companies, which is the so-called "material head material". Later, several companies gradually cooperated, and the scale was larger, but the goods were still purchased by the piece (woolen stores are now called dismantling stores, which is how it started). Later, the need for woolen gradually increased, and a part of the Hongbang tailors began to stand on their own and specialize in wholesale woolen. The first companies to set up shops to operate this industry independently were Laoshengji, Quanji, and Yuantai Woolen Companies. Laoshengji closed down after the European War due to the impact of first-order settlement prices. Quanji and Yuantai still exist today.</p>
<p>As for the rise and fall of the industry, it can be divided into four periods in detail: The first period, from the beginning to the European War, was the stable period of the industry. 1919 to 1920 was the panic period of the industry, because the European War ended, the market recovered, the first order suddenly fell, and they could not cope. Laoshengji went out of business one after another, as mentioned above. The most sensational one at the time was the forced closure of the Renyigongji Woolen Company. From 1921 to 1929, it turned into the golden age of the industry, such as the rise of Yikang, Huafutai, and Yichangtai, the expansion of Huaxing, and the addition of a large number of subsidiary companies to Meilun, all of which occurred during this period. From 1929 to the present, it has been an autumn of unease for the industry. The decline of the world economy, the instability of overseas exchange rates, and the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents in China all have significant relationships. As for its depressed situation, regionally speaking, Hongkou and Sichuan Road are the most affected, while Daxin Street is less affected, and recently there has been a gradual trend of improvement.</p>
<p>Shanghai's woolen sales industry can also be observed by region. According to the survey, the industry is concentrated in Hongkou, Nanjing Road, and the old North Gate area, followed by Sichuan Road and Daxin Street, similar to Xiafei Road and Ximen. It is said that the birthplace of the woolen sales industry was Hongkou, and then it extended to Nanjing Road and the Qipan Street area. The earliest woolen company in Nanjing Road was Rongchangxiang Woolen Company, and the earliest in Qipan Street was Meilun. As for the old North Gate area, Gu Ruiji was the first. At present, the largest companies in the industry are Chunheyong, Huaxing, He Jinfeng, Zhaoji, Yikang, Lianxing, and Wang Xingchang in Qipan Street.</p>
<p>According to the quality of the woolen sold, the industry can be divided into three grades: The first grade is the Hongkou Nanjing Road area, because the woolen sold is of higher quality (the so-called fancy goods or ready-made materials), the price is firm, and the changes are small. The woolen companies in Qipan Street are second, because the goods they sell are mainly general goods (ordinary goods), although they also sell ready-made goods, but the price is not fixed and there is more room for bargaining. The old North Gate area is second. The center of woolen trading has now shifted to the Qipan Street area. This can be seen from the annual turnover of each district in the past two years (according to the general estimate of people in the industry): Estimated table of annual turnover of woolen companies in each district of Shanghai: Hongkou area, a little less than 2 million yuan, Nanjing Road area, the same as above, Qipan Street area, a little more than 8 million yuan, Sichuan Road area, a little more than 1 million yuan, old North Gate area, a little less than 800,000 yuan.

<h3>Investigation of Industry in Liangguang and the Future of National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The keys to the domestic goods industry; one is the problem of raw material supply, and the other is the problem of product sales. To solve these two problems, we must first cooperate nationwide and unanimously aim at resisting foreign goods. However, how to cooperate must start with investigating the industry in various places. Liangguang is a major metropolis in the southwest, and it is allowed to be a distribution area for the production and sales of goods, which has the value of examination. The organization of the Liangguang Industrial Inspection Group is the greatest purpose. After visiting Guangdong and Guangxi for on-site observation, I have fully learned about the actual situation of the industry and commerce of the two provinces and the current economic situation. I deeply feel that the supply of raw materials and the exchange of goods are closely related to Shanghai in every way. The people of Liangguang are rich in patriotic ideas, and using domestic goods is a lifelong habit of the people. Guangdong has a large land and population, and the social consumption is extremely large, and the ability to live is healthier, so domestic goods are easier to sell than in other places. Although several industries are within the scope of provincial management, goods from other provinces are also welcome. If the currency system can be unified and the donations and taxes can be simplified, then goods from all over the country will be transported to Guangdong, and the future of domestic goods is very promising. Guangxi's products are not thin, and there are more raw materials, such as tung oil, anise oil, leather, wood, and minerals, worth tens of millions of yuan a year. Factories in Shanghai can purchase them in large quantities according to their business needs. The people of Guangxi can use the proceeds of the goods to import foreign goods such as yarn and machinery, which is more beneficial to both. Social figures in both places have a warm embrace for promoting domestic goods. For example, the Guangzhou National Goods Promotion Committee and the Nanning National Goods Exhibition have achieved brilliant results, and Guangxi's artificial cloth and shoes are allowed to be models for using domestic goods. According to people in the two provinces, people recently take pride in using domestic goods for clothing and daily necessities, and feel ashamed to buy foreign goods. Even women are also strongly advocating the use of domestic goods, which is gratifying. However, the domestic goods industry has no military backing and no policy protection. Hard work and struggle often lead to failure. Mr. Bai Jiansheng said that if industrial construction is not guaranteed by military affairs and regulated by policies, it is often a victim of airplanes and artillery. Therefore, if industrial construction is to succeed, there must be sufficient self-defense forces to guarantee it. This is truly a sharp point. Therefore, in addition to the import and export trade office, Guangxi also has a disguised tax and donation bureau, which collects different tax rates for foreign and domestic goods, and has invisibly eliminated a lot of foreign goods imports. Our people are extremely happy for the colleagues in the domestic goods industry. I hope that the Liangguang authorities, after contacting the examination group, will further contact, or set up agencies, or specially organize groups to directly communicate to communicate the products between the two places. In both domestic and foreign trade, it can stand in a superior position. Then the harvest of this trip will be great.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Goods through Small Industries</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>"Empty words are of no help; practice is essential." This saying has become the mantra of every advocate for national goods in this current stage.</p>
<p>Indeed, the development of national goods can only proceed along two paths. On one hand, we must strive to promote the consumption of national goods, awakening those who were once firmly entrenched in their worship of foreign goods. On the other hand, we must make every effort to increase the production of national goods, actively promote numerous small industries, work diligently and practically, and lay the strongest foundation for the future of our national goods production.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, our country is fundamentally an agricultural nation. Its existing economic organization has evolved from the past "self-sufficient rural economy." The difficulty in establishing large industries stems from objective environmental limitations and the threat of foreign aggression, leaving them in a state of stagnation. As for small industries? Upon closer inspection of their production and output, they still fall short. Many everyday necessities, in particular, still await creation, requiring our indomitable spirit to strive and struggle, aiming for exquisite products to replace the foreign goods that monopolize the Chinese market, and to lay the groundwork for national goods industries. In this time of economic collapse, foreign goods flooding the market, and acute unemployment, these industries can provide relief to unemployed compatriots, revitalize real industries, promote prosperity in commerce and industry, and restore national strength.</p>
<p>As for how to start and manage small industries in these times, many entrepreneurs are hesitant due to the sluggish national market. This is, in fact, a "cutting off one's nose to spite one's face" mentality. It must be understood that the current development of national industries requires the courageous advancement of the business community and the unanimous support of the entire population. Therefore, I dare to propose several points worth noting when starting a business, for the reference and learning of those involved:</p>
<p>First, production-sales cooperation and economic turnover: At the beginning of establishing small industries, one should try to join national goods groups, such as the National Goods Production and Sales Cooperative Association and local Chinese National Goods Companies, to strive to meet public demand and establish social credibility. At the same time, one should closely study smooth economic turnover, establish connections with the financial sector, utilize small credit loans, and implement acceptance bills to eliminate concerns about economic hardship.</p>
<p>Second, technical talent and national raw materials: For those engaged in small industries, in order to obtain exquisite products and reduce costs, there should be careful selection of technical personnel. At the same time, efforts should be made to use domestic raw materials, so that the domestic raw material industry can also fully develop.</p>
<h3>To Recognize Oneself as a Chinese Person</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu (Owner of Yiyi Studio)</p>
<p>——"National Goods Save the Nation" is the only Hope——</p>
<p>Originally, a good Chinese person, when his own country clearly already has good "national goods," why must he be unwilling to part with "foreign goods" and insist on using "foreign goods"? Isn't this strange?</p>
<p>In fact, upon closer thought, this question is easily answered and not at all strange.</p>
<p>To know why a good Chinese person, when his own country already has good "national goods" that are not being used, insists on using "foreign goods," frankly speaking, it's simply because the Chinese person does not recognize himself as a Chinese person!</p>
<p>Precisely because one does not recognize oneself as a Chinese person, one can bear to disregard "national goods" and use "foreign goods"! If one can truly recognize oneself as a Chinese person, I can boldly say that one would never abandon one's conscience and willingly become a "foreign fanatic."</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to urge everyone here to recognize from now on that you are a Chinese person, not a foreigner. Only in this way can you know to not love "foreign goods" and to love "national goods," only then can you avoid becoming a slave to "foreign goods" again, only then can you avoid becoming a "foreign goods salesperson." Then, "national goods save the nation" will have hope.</p>
<h3>The Success of National Goods Steam Road Rollers</h3>
<p>Yi</p>
<p>— Yi Lu</p>
<p>Manufactured by the Henan Agricultural and Industrial Machinery Factory - Affordable and of Good Quality, Worthy of Competing with Foreign Goods</p>
<p>In recent years, our country has indeed attached great importance to highway construction, so provinces and cities are actively building highways. As far as we know, more than five provinces and cities in China have already built highways, which is naturally a good phenomenon. However, people only know the benefits of building highways, but overlook the huge expenses of highway construction. Apart from other things, the essential items used for highway construction – steam road rollers – are entirely foreign goods. The value of this kind of steam road roller is very expensive. Each one costs over ten thousand yuan. As far as the steam road rollers used throughout the country are concerned, this expense is really enough to make people gasp! However, it is necessary to use this machine for road construction. Since there is no national good that can replace it, although it is known to be an extravagance, there is no way to reverse it. Isn't this a very painful thing? But now I come to report a piece of news to the readers, that is, our Henan Agricultural and Industrial Machinery Manufacturing Factory has been able to imitate it! Moreover, the materials used are all national goods, which can be said to be good news in the national goods year! Moreover, the value of this kind of national goods steam road roller is half that of imported goods. Each one can be made for only seven or eight thousand yuan. The factory is trying to promote sales and is also raising a large amount of capital for manufacturing purposes. Regarding the manufacturing motive of the machine, it is due to the factory's overall engineering technicians, half for the purpose of reversing leakage; half for the purpose of developing business. According to the factory's statement: the structure of this steam road roller is somewhat different from that of imported goods, but the function is the same. The weight of the whole machine is more than nine tons, and its components include: Boiler: It is a locomotive-style fire tube boiler that burns bituminous coal. The combustion area is 484 square inches. The heat transfer area, with twenty-six fire tubes, is 59 square inches. The effective vapor pressure is 100 pounds per square inch. The rear half of the boiler is a water tank. When the machine is turned on, water is absorbed from the water tank by the water spring and transferred to the boiler. The smoke is transferred from the fire tube to the smoke box, and then to the chimney. Engine: It is a compound steam engine, with three cylinders of different sizes. The diameter of the small one is 5.2 inches; the diameter of the large one is 7.7 inches. The steam generated by the boiler is stored in the vapor cylinder. When the machine is turned on, the steam valve is opened, and the steam enters the steam pipe and then into the intermediate cylinder. The residual gas of the small cylinder still returns to the intermediate cylinder and enters the rear of the large cylinder, and then transfers to the chimney for ventilation. Variable speed gear system: This is a gear changer, which is connected to the curved shaft. Reversing vehicle: This is a machine used for reversing and forwarding. Rudder: This is a machine used to steer left and right. If you turn to the left, move a wire rope on the left wheel rudder; if you turn to the right, move a wire rope on the right. In addition, there are two luxurious machines for refueling and adding water. They have already made one; they have been publicly tested before the month, and the results are very good, so this national goods steam road roller has reached the stage of complete success!</p>
<h3>National Goods Newsletter</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>(Sent from Nanning)</p>
<p>Nanning is the capital of Guangxi Province, and its commerce has been relatively prosperous recently. When we arrived in Nanning, a national goods exhibition was being held. More than a thousand people visited every day, and women accounted for half of them. In addition to local products from this province, exhibits mostly included products from national goods factories in Guangdong and Shanghai. Lin Boyin, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Huang Daming, standing committee member of the Provincial Party Department, both said that the people of Nanning are extremely patriotic, and foreign goods are not easy to sell in the market. People often spontaneously organize inspection teams to assist institutions in inspecting shops. In addition, the provincial tax bureau imposes very light taxes on national goods, while imposing very heavy taxes on foreign goods. Taking cigarettes as an example, foreign cigarettes have almost disappeared in this province. It can be seen that it is as difficult as ascending to heaven for foreign goods to be sold in Guangxi Province. Recently, women have also been taking the lead in eliminating extravagance, so their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are based on the principle of frugality, and they mainly use national goods. I once went to the streets to see that the goods displayed in various shops were indeed mostly national goods, and the prices were also cheap. However, the Guangxi currency must be one yuan and five corners to equal one Shanghai yuan, so national goods from Shanghai must be slightly more expensive. Chairman Lin and his colleagues in the Chamber of Commerce all said that they will work harder to promote national goods in the future and set up more national goods companies to promote them. Standing Committee Member Huang of the Party Department is willing to lead local groups and women's circles to organize national goods consumption groups to set an example for various places. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai also said that he is willing to do his best to help the national goods industry, so that the difficulties of the national goods industry can be gradually reduced, and said that if there is no policy as a backing for foreign trade, it is indeed extremely difficult. He is willing to seek development for the national goods industry as much as possible, and the intention of Quan Zhi is especially unforgettable for the colleagues in the national goods industry.</p>

<p>Special Issue of the Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Exhibition</p>
<h3>Declaration of the National Medicine Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Association</p>
<p>Chinese medicine has accumulated thousands of years of experience and has gained trust in society and spread overseas. In the past, the government had the organization of the Central National Medicine Hall. Recently, the regulations on traditional Chinese medicine have been promulgated. This is because the scholarship itself possesses a transcending spirit. And the efficacy of the drugs is truly remarkable. It accounts for a large part. Let's take a look at its strengths. There are two ends. National medicine is good at taking the root cause of the disease. It does not value superficial and rapid means. To take effect in a time. And can receive the merit of Wang Dao. This is one. Also, it is good at treating complex and mixed symptoms of mixed symptoms. And less side effects and severe toxic substances. Therefore, there are no adverse reactions. Consistent with the physique of Chinese people. Moreover, nineteen of the Chinese medicines are purely domestic products. The value is low. Far from imported goods. Not only suitable for the economic level of the people. And planting and collecting. Related to rural livelihoods. It is the hope of the national lifeline. Therefore, countries all over the world are competing to study Chinese medicine as the latest discovery of the century. National medicinal materials. Packed away. Become a major export. My colleagues at the Association are all aware of the fact that national medicine today is a huge problem in my country. On the occasion of the Shanghai Union, the related medicinal materials industry, the national medicine industry, and the ginseng bird industry. With the support of the Botanical Garden. Organize a national medicine exhibition. Several times of preparation. You can meet the citizens. And I can’t help but solemnly say five points to the visitors. First, in the eye-catching and beautiful drugs. Should know where the wealth of our country lies. Second, in the process of cultivation and preparation. Should know the urgency of the relationship between people's livelihood. Third, in the greatness of function and efficacy. Should know the preciousness of value. Fourth, in the meticulousness of choice. Should know the investigation of the location. Fifth, in the precious materials. Should know the authenticity of the distinction. It is because of the expectations of this Association. Get a multi-faceted understanding when browsing. And understand that national medicine should be actively promoted. It is not just for the appreciation of a part. And I only feel the richness and excellence of national medicine. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Feelings on Holding the National Medicine Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shanghai Municipal National Medicine Industry Association</p>
<p>The magic of medicine and stone. In a word, it is the end. It is appropriate to use it. Therefore, ginseng is sometimes ineffective. Arsenic can also save people.</p>
<p>Our country has medicine. The invention dates back to 5,000 years ago. The historical records are written. It is the honor of the Chinese nation. The sages of the past dynasties. Continue to work hard. Dig sand and pick gold. That is, objects to test the effect. That is, take the effect to seek reason. Wring your brains. Vomit blood. It makes thousands of species of medicine taste more or less unique. Although Western medicine says that it has no chemical effect and is not suitable for gypsum talc. Correct the symptoms and send. All are wonderful products. It can be seen that the magic of the effect of Chinese medicine. There are those who cannot exhaust their principles to the shallow. This is not only documented. That is, those who have been baptized by science also recognize it.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea ban. Imperialist culture and economy. Anonymous missionaries came to show their aggressive ambitions. The footprint of leather shoes. The evil cause is buried. Knocks on the door with bricks. Plant less favors to win people's hearts. Medicine is the first to bear the brunt. Down to today. Imperialist cultural and economic aggression. The great work is done. My country's people's livelihood economy is in unprecedented panic. My country's drugs. Only possess a long history. Magical effect. But I can't resist foreign forces outside the country. For the national economy. Maintain a complete aspect. It is a pity.</p>
<p>although. Due to the success of imperialist cultural and economic aggression. Make national medicine must suffer some losses. But the value of national medicine in the therapeutic effect. Fundamentally unshaken. Even more remarkable because of comparison. Self-confidence is also more firm. Under the consciousness of consolidating the national economic barrier, it is inevitable that the Chinese people will cut off their past infatuations and become soldiers in this barrier. At this time. National medicine with its broad foundation. Excellent materials. Add the latest construction. The brightness of its future. Unlimited. Therefore, the loss suffered today. It can be concluded that it is only the sun covered by floating clouds. It is very temporary. Is it always being oppressed by others? The motive of today's national medicine exhibition. Gai is born of this.</p>
<p>The meaning of the national medicine exhibition. In promoting the attention of the whole country, up and down. Knowing that my country has as many medicines as possible. And the value of its therapeutic effect. Stimulate the interest of talented people in research. If you get the guidance of social elites. Encouraging it. Make the ideal have the day of realization. National and national. What is the benefit of Lai? Can't help but pray for the fragrance.</p>

<h3>Ten Important Aspects of Vocational Supplementary Education (1)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>Vocational supplementary education, in the entire field of vocational education, has gradually felt its important position, or it can even be said that it has gradually become equal to formal vocational school education. I am afraid that this is also the way the current social environment and needs force it to do so.</p>
<p>Chinese society was originally an unhealthy society, but because of its unhealthy nature, it especially needs vocational supplementary education to supplement it, so that its unhealthy problems can gradually be reduced, and it may slowly be able to make it healthy.</p>
<p>What a pity is that China has been running vocational education for more than 30 years, but it has not yet made most people feel or understand the importance of vocational supplementary education within the scope of vocational education. I am here to write this article, but it has some meaning of shouting out loud, wanting to tell everyone the importance of it - that is, the importance seen in the current Chinese society - and let everyone know, especially hoping that our colleagues in the education field will pay attention to it and jointly take responsibility for greatly promoting it.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Children's education needs to be universal, which is a matter of course and without doubt. Assuming that children's education has been universalized, then, after children have received national education, they are still young, so can they make a living in society? Can they be independent? Can they get new knowledge and new skills in various occupations when they are sent to farms, businesses, and factories as apprentices? If not, what should be done? This is a question. Speaking of this, it seems natural to think of vocational supplementary education. With vocational supplementary education, it can be used to provide appropriate training for a group of young people who have received primary school education (or junior or senior) and are preparing to enter or have already entered the industry. With this kind of training, then, for the individual, it can increase vocational knowledge and skills and cultural knowledge, so that he can be economically independent in society, and for the society, it can improve old occupations and create new occupations, and seek development for the economy of the entire nation and country. Is there any need to say how important this relationship is? And its importance is already obvious, isn't it? This is to see the importance of vocational education from the young people who have received national education.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Moreover, today, compulsory education in China cannot be universalized. There are many young people and adults who have not received education and are illiterate. May I ask, what should be done for this group of people? Spreading literacy education to eliminate illiteracy is, of course, the most urgent task at present. However, can simply being literate solve their entire life problems? I don't think so. Then, what should be done? Speaking of this, I am afraid that people will think of vocational supplementary education. I think that literacy education may as well be mixed with vocational supplementary education and done together. That is, to add vocational materials to the text and to have vocational practice outside the text. In this way, the problem of how to educate most out-of-school young people and adults can be solved by vocational education methods. All young adults who have received vocational supplementary education can not only be citizens but also producers. They can not only read but also work. In this way, the effect of education will be more effective and far-reaching. This is to see the importance of vocational supplementary education from young adults who have not received national education.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Not only that, but we are suffering from poverty everywhere in China now. It is not easy for a student to enter university, and it is not easy to enter secondary school, and it still costs money to enter vocational school. Parents and brothers are busy paying tuition fees for their children, and they are miserable, and the students are studying at school, and they don't know what will happen next semester, and their minds are unusually uneasy, and even after graduating from school, whether there is a job to be employed is still a problem. Try to go to the inland to see, this kind of complaints can be heard everywhere, and even people say that schools are harmful. If there is vocational supplementary education, it can remedy many things. Children do not necessarily have to go to school after graduating from elementary school, and they can be sent to the industry. Although they cannot learn any new knowledge in farms, shops, and factories, there are vocational supplementary schools to meet their needs. They work during the day and go to school in the morning or evening. A part of what they learn is vocational courses, and a part is cultural courses. They learn a little and get a little, which is the same as what they get from going to school, or even more practical, and the suffering of parents and brothers being busy paying tuition fees and the suffering of young people worrying about not being able to pay tuition fees are completely gone. Look, how great is its effect. This is to see the importance of vocational supplementary education from the situation of parents providing tuition fees for their children.</p>
<p>School Survey: An Overview of the Shanghai French School (2) Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>2. School Buildings and Equipment</p>
<p>The school building was transformed from the former French Club building, so the entire school building cannot be said to meet the ideals of education. The entire school building occupies more than ten acres of land, and the transportation is quite convenient. The school is a day school, so there are no dormitories. The lower floor of the school building is the kindergarten, the first and second grade classrooms of the elementary school, and the offices of various departments; the second and third floors are the ordinary and specialized classrooms of the upper grades of the elementary school and the various grades of the middle school. In total, there are 23 ordinary classrooms; there are special classrooms such as a science room, a music room, an art room, a library, and an auditorium. Because the entire school building was transformed from the club building, the sizes of the classrooms vary, and the lighting and ventilation are not complete. The area of the sports field is very large; and the playgrounds for primary and secondary schools are separated, so that primary and secondary school students will not conflict. There are also two covered playgrounds, which are used by primary and secondary school students respectively. Other facilities such as dining halls, cloakrooms, drinking fountains, men's and women's toilets, clinics, and kitchens are all available.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, student desks and chairs are mostly double-seater, and the style is not new and not easy to move. The classroom layout is quite simple; and there are not many teaching aids. The equipment and supplies for other subjects, such as science equipment and sports equipment, are all equipped according to the standards set by the French Education Department, and funds are added and supplemented every year.</p>
<p>3. Administrative Overview</p>
<p>Administrative Organization: French educational administration and school administration both adopt a centralized system. The French Ministry of Education stipulates the facilities for schools at all levels across the country, such as teaching syllabus, teaching hours, textbooks, and standards for each subject. In the school, the administrative power is completely concentrated in the principal, who handles school affairs with full authority according to the decrees of the Ministry of Education. In the past, the French Municipal Council only established this school, and at that time, the school affairs were directly under the control of the French Municipal Council. Now, the French Municipal Council has also opened Remy School and two Chinese Children's Elementary Schools, so it has established an education department in the bureau to manage these four schools and subsidize private schools and other matters.</p>

<h3>World Games Football Pre-Selection Shanghai and North China Players to Hong Kong Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The pre-selection will be completed and will come to Shanghai at the end of this month. The Sports Association will send Zhou Jiaqi to take care of it.</p>
<p>My country's participation in the World Games football team is scheduled to hold a pre-selection in Hong Kong starting from April 4. Twenty elite players will be selected from the initial selection of 30 players to form the Chinese team. After the selection is completed, they will come to Shanghai in mid-May to practice, and then go abroad to Germany with other players. Zhang Rongcai, Li Ning, Liang Shutang, Sun Jinshun, Chen Zhenhe, Jia Youliang, Tan Fuzhen and other seven players from the initial selection of the Shanghai and North China regions were originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong today to participate in the pre-selection. Now, due to some matters, it has been changed to depart south on the McKinley President ship of the Dala Company at 9:30 am on April 2. The China National Sports Association has also sent Zhou Jiaqi to accompany them to take care of everything. Chen Zhenhe, Zhang Rongcai, and Liang Shutang, who belong to Youyou's command, initially planned to take the Hoover President ship on the 7th to participate in the West Union football match against French businesses on the 4th and 5th. Now, because the Hong Kong side has many practice matches in addition to the two official matches on the 18th against the Hong Kong military and the 19th against the mixed team, which are all held before April 10, the matter is in fact too late, so it has been decided to give up this claim and still travel with Sun Li Tan Jia and others tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Dr. Wang Zhengting Talks about the Purpose of Our Country's Participation in the World Games</h3>
<p>Divided into Three Points</p>
<p>The 11th World Games is scheduled to be held in the Olympic Village in Berlin, Germany in mid-September this year. Our country is now actively preparing to participate in football, basketball, track and field, national arts, swimming, race walking and other events. According to Dr. Wang Zhengting, President of the National Sports Association, the reporter of the National Glory Society said that our country only sent Liu Changchun to participate in the previous World Games, but there were no achievements. This year, our country is preparing to participate on a large scale, and the purpose is three points. In the past, although sports in our country have been continuously developing, they have been isolated due to too few opportunities to contact the outside world. This participation, although our country's hope of scoring points is very slim, can use this good opportunity to make our country's sports circles have a deep understanding of the outside world. The creation of society depends on the cooperation of human beings, and sports can express the importance of cooperation. In this World Games, all the countries participating in Europe and the United States are working together with one heart and one mind, focusing on the gains and losses of the championship. Although our country does not have this kind of hope, it can also cultivate this kind of spirit. Our country has decided to select representatives, and every focus is on promising new talents. As for athletes who are older or who have been famous for a while in the past, they have been cut off. Regarding this point, the gentlemen responsible for the selection have their own painstaking efforts. Mr. Wang continued, saying that our country's delegation is scheduled to go abroad in early June, and he will also accompany them to Germany.</p>

<h3>According to Shen Kunnan, Jiangda Basketball Championship Belongs to Jinan</h3>
<p>The last match of the Jiangda Basketball Championship, Fudan vs. Jinan, was originally scheduled to be held in Zhenru on the 25th, but was postponed to the 128th of last month due to a special event in Fudan. When the time came, Fudan still did not arrive due to an incident, and the match could not be held. According to Mr. Shen Kunnan, the coach of Jinan University, told reporters yesterday that according to the regulations, the Jiangda match cannot be postponed. This year's championship should be held by Jinan University, and the coach of Fudan and chairman of the Jiangda Basketball Committee, Chen Defu, agreed at the time of requesting a postponement last month that there would be no more postponements, and the three generals of Jinan, Wang Yin and Cai, would have to go to Beiping to participate in the World Games basketball collection training, which would naturally have an impact on the strength. Therefore, Jinan University cannot postpone it any longer under this situation. On the same day, the Basketball Committee of the Sports Department of Jinan University issued a notice, which read, "The Jiangda Basketball Final, Fudan University still cannot come to the school to make up for the match today due to an incident. According to the regulations, this year's championship should be held by our school." However, the final decision still needs to be formally approved by the committee.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a rise in large bars, support for selling on the ground, coupled with a sharp drop in raw gold. It was reported that the gold quotes were small, thus selling outweighed buying, and the trend continued to weaken. There were still fluctuations in the middle, and people were unsettled.

<h3>Securities Trading is Weak, Government Bonds Trend Lower</h3>
<p>Only 96 Current Month Shows Slight Improvement</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange further declined, and market prices continued to weaken, failing to show any improvement. Selling parties dumped Group A bonds, and trading remained mostly in Group C bonds. Spot trading also opened for the first time yesterday, with Group A at $65.15, roughly the same as the futures price. The overall market trend is expected to continue downward, as every time the gavel struck, there was a rush to sell, but not indiscriminately, so while market prices were weak, a major collapse was not triggered. Since its launch, the Unified Government Bond has been trading for over a month, and large dealers have never been seen to buy or sell in large quantities, so even in a poor environment, it has been able to maintain its ordinary market price of over 60%, partly because speculative fervor has subsided and investment is still cautious, partly because the financial sector is stagnant, resulting in a calm state. Although the fluctuating trend has not yet broken free, the overall trend is gradually downward. Yesterday, during the opening, retail investors bought in, and No. 35 was also in demand, slightly improving by 0.05-0.10. Later, as No. 20 sold more Group A bonds, the price fell by 0.25. In the second session, Nos. 10, 11, and 47 all sold, but they were indiscriminately sold at low prices, while No. 35 continued to buy in. Market prices continued to see highs and lows, fluctuating between 0.05 and 0.10. During the afternoon opening, selling pressure was relatively strong, as buyers became increasingly scarce, and market prices continued to fall, with each decline being slightly smaller than 0.10-0.20 in the morning. Trading volume declined sharply at the close, and Groups E and D, as well as Group A forwards, were unable to open, and market prices returned to a chaotic state, with inconsistent differences. As a result, with the exception of 96 for the current month, which slightly improved by 0.05, all other bonds consistently fell by 0.10-0.20 to 0.45. The total trading volume was $2,700,500, plus $2,000 for Group A spot. The results of the increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Type | Highest Price | Session | Lowest Price | Session | Change from Previous Day | Trading Volume</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Abnormally Stagnant</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that yesterday (30th), the New York stock market was abnormally stagnant. Speculators were waiting for the trend to be confirmed and remained on the sidelines. Although steel mill operations increased from 15.5% to 62%, and the French situation stabilized, the market was unmoved. The increases and decreases were meaningless. The demand for agricultural implements and mail-order stocks was strong, silver stocks slightly increased, railway stocks were mixed, and automobile stocks slightly weakened. The small exchange and bond market fluctuated. Total daily volume was 950,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Spot Goods are Tight, Auction Yarn is Still Supportable</h3>
<p>However, Most People Still Expect a Weak Market</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the overseas yarn and cotton situation is stable. At the same time, spot yarn trading in the South China area is gradually picking up. Therefore, spot goods are still tight. However, the general industry expects a downward trend, as the base has reached a high level. However, banks, gold merchants, and securities firms are still in a long position.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn, Han Gang Buys in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The previous market for auction yarn saw a jump in all months. The opening was due to the development of spot yarn business on the previous day. Osaka Sanpin yarn rose. Dafu bought in large quantities on behalf of Han Gang. All months rose by 0.8-0.9 jiao. However, Yichang tried to sell off, and after the second session, there was a slight pullback. As a result, all months rose by 0.3-0.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening lacked momentum, but Dafu continued to buy in at the market price, supporting the market. However, most people still expected a weak market. As a result, all months fell by 0.1-0.3 jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<h3>Rumor Has it that Tianjin Coarse Wool is Being Delivered in Shanghai, Cotton Shorts are Adding Heavily</h3>
<p>The recent cotton market has turned loose, because the longs have slightly sold off, and the shorts have also added, and there is a rumor that Tianjin coarse wool will come to Shanghai for delivery, so people's hearts are also frustrated.

At the same time, the yarn market was good, and the momentum was tight, and the far month rose 0.2 jiao. After the second session, the shorts added, and the longs settled, and the market turned weak. As a result, the near month fell 0.2 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day, and the far month rose 0.05 jiao. The afternoon opening market situation was quite weak, because Yuanxingchang Yikang shorts added heavily, and the pressure was very heavy, but Dafu Mingde worked hard to buy, and the market relied on support.

<h3>Silk and Tea Overseas Silk Prices Rise Frequently, Chinese Silk Exports Still Observing</h3>
<p>New Goods: Manufacturers Reluctant to Sell Cheaply Due to High Expectations; Difficult Transactions Due to Extended French Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Yokohama silk prices have been rising frequently. Yesterday's spot price was 812 yuan, and the futures price was 806 yuan, an increase of about 100 yuan compared to half a month ago. As a result, silk prices in New York and Lyon have also risen accordingly. However, foreign trade in Shanghai has not expanded as a result. This is because Shanghai has a shortage of silk reserves, new goods are expected to be expensive, and manufacturers are reluctant to sell them easily. Transactions in Lyon are difficult due to the extended French exchange rate. Overseas silk sales are still being observed. User silk transactions seem to be quite satisfied, so the price has fallen slightly, and transactions are not as strong as last week.</p>
<h3>Slight Movement in Sales of Xiu Mei Green Tea</h3>
<p>Recently, the green tea market has remained sluggish. Zhen Mei from Wuyuan and Tunxi areas still faces difficulties in sales in the Moroccan market.

The total transaction volume in the city is over 400 packages, with the market price opening at 11 yuan and 6 jiao. Currently, the inventory of green tea in the market is 1,900 boxes of Lu Zhuang tea, 1,500 boxes of Ping Shui tea, and 3,300 boxes of Tu Zhuang tea. Foreign firms have 18,000 boxes that have not been packed for export. Judging from the current market situation, it is said that it is quite difficult to clear the inventory.</p>
<h3>Grain: Handling Delivery of Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>No Delivery of Standard Wheat; Very Large Delivery Volume of Yellow Soybeans</p>
<p>Yesterday's delivery of miscellaneous grains saw no delivery of wheat because of the scarcity of old stock, and spot goods were successively allocated to factories. However, the delivery volume of carload yellow soybeans was very large, because oil factories bought futures and were prepared to take delivery, while the sellers were all customers from the producing areas. Therefore, under mutual expansion, the actual delivery volume reached a huge 113 carloads. According to the count, 12 carloads were delivered on the 5th, 4 carloads on the 6th, 1 carload on the 7th, 8 carloads on the 15th, 2 carloads on the 16th, 22 carloads on the 24th, 2 carloads on the 26th, 6 carloads on the 35th, 37 carloads on the 38th, 1 carload on the 41st, and 18 carloads on the 45th.

<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, 31-32 sources arrived from various locations downstream. White Japonica rice shops in the market turned slightly active, and the market price rose by a few cents to a dime. The market situation stabilized in the afternoon. Retail sales of Bo Dao rice were average, and the price was stable. Yin Wu turned tight. Bai Yuan arrivals and sales were balanced, and the price showed no gains or losses. Few Yang Bu Jian goods arrived, and retail sales were still possible, with prices trending tighter. The prices of all other goods were stable.</p>
<h3>Situation of Ke Xian Rice Slightly Weakened</h3>
<p>—But Sellers Still Unwilling to Lower Prices for Sales—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for Ke Xian rice saw continued arrivals from the Yangtze River area, and shipments from Taiwan, Wenzhou, and other places also arrived in Shanghai one after another. Jiangxi rice has abundant reserves and arrivals, and is currently the mainstay of Ke rice. Yesterday, the Ke Pu market was completely stagnant, and there was no smooth handling in the local street. Therefore, the situation of all rice types was generally weak, and the market was trending towards fatigue. However, sellers' intentions were very firm and they were unwilling to lower prices for sales. Therefore, although the market was weak, prices have not fallen. Only high-end goods had no transactions. In the afternoon, after the market closed, local village merchants and small group households bought more than 2,000 packages of Jiangxi Ji Wan rice, and the market price immediately rebounded by 3-5 cents. High-grade Ji Wan opened at 11 yuan and 2 jiao, medium grade at 11 yuan and 5 fen, and the lowest grade at 10 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. A total of 4,500 packages of Gan Wan rice, over 100 packages each of early rice and brown rice, 500 packages of Jiangbei rice, 300 packages of Anqing rice, 500 packages of Xiang oil, and 1,290 packages of Wen Tai rice were offered. Only 200 tons of reclaimed Siamese rice and 200 packages of Xiao Jiao were available among foreign rice. Other Sai Gon Xiao Jiao and other types did not trade due to disagreement on prices.</p>
<h3>Oil Prices Rise; Rapeseed Sells Well</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Packages of New Rapeseed Released</p>
<p>The rapeseed market has been excited by the soaring oil prices. Last week, Guang merchants handled two batches of Ping Hu goods, and yesterday they continued to deliver 500 packages, with the selling price rising by 5 cents to 7 yuan and 8 jiao. Currently, two batches of new rapeseed have been released. Orders for Ping Hu and Suzhou goods for delivery in June and July are priced at 7 yuan, 4 jiao and 7 fen, with 12,500 packages traded. Orders for Wuhu goods for delivery in July and August are priced at 7 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, with 2,000 packages traded. All were purchased by Japanese foreign firms.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Shantou Exchange Rate Contracts, Sugar Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Since the Shantou exchange rate started to rise, domestic Chao sugar has been facing weak Shanghai sales, and the market situation has been extremely sluggish. The cargo companies have been holding back for a long time without opening, and trading companies are also watching without making progress. However, according to yesterday's telegram from Shantou, the situation has tightened. Not only has the Shantou exchange rate contracted by eight yuan, but sugar prices have also risen across the board. For example, red sugar has risen by four jiao, and green sugar has also risen by one jiao. Adding the exchange rate and customs duty, which require an additional jiao, the market may turn around from this point on. Yesterday, the Chi Hao plate followed the rise by two or three jiao, opening at 12 yuan and 7 jiao for over 100 packages.</p>
<p>The Guild's allocation: 22 yuan for spot 24 Coarse Granulated White, 6 yuan 9 jiao 8 fen for re-exported goods, and no change in the original prices for Dong Chi White and locally produced Mian White. It is predicted that the bidding price for domestic Guangdong Coarse White today may show signs of easing. The step-by-step decline has reached about eight jiao, and it is possible that an extreme fatigue will lead to a rebound.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Wenzhou Candied Tangerine Market Price Loosens</h3>
<p>The sales of Wenzhou candied tangerines have decreased recently, and the trend is loosening. The current market opening price has fallen by one yuan before and after. Therefore, purchases from Hunan, Changsha, and other places have resumed. It is heard that the production price has also loosened, with a price difference of slightly more than half a yuan compared to Shanghai. As a result, soft cakes from Xiamen lack buyers at the original price, and must also fall in price in order to have sales.</p>
<h3>Daylily Price Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Since the market price of daylily fell, purchases from Guangdong and Fujian merchants have been stagnant, and few goods have been offered. Yesterday, it was heard that over 40 packages of Da Xing daylily had been sold, with slightly varying quality, priced at 24 yuan and 3 jiao to 24 yuan and 8 jiao. Also, a certain firm recently offered 100 packages of Li Tai Xuzhou daylily at 22 yuan and 5 jiao. It is said that the buyers are still unwilling to sell, and the market shows signs of stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Paraffin Wax Follows Tung Oil Rise</h3>
<p>The paraffin wax market situation: prices are trapped in a valley. Although the soap factory's sales path is healthy, unfortunately, candle retail sales are sluggish, and inventories are temporarily difficult to digest. Last week, tung oil rose sharply, and various oils followed suit (see this newspaper on the 21st). During the past week, paraffin wax has also started to change. According to Han news, peeled snow is 15 yuan 6 jiao to 8 jiao, and Macheng is 15 yuan 2 jiao to 4 jiao (both market prices). Jingjin followed the rise. Macheng buyers still want to raise the price. According to Zhejiang news, He Ben is 18 yuan and Jinlan is 18 yuan 3 jiao to 4 jiao. According to Sichuan news, the river is dry and the waterway is difficult, and the inventory is thin, so there are not many recent arrivals. On March 26th, Sichuan merchant Xinchang released over 40 bundles (each bundle weighing about 3 dan, market weight), priced at 136 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hui Si Iron and Tobacco Factory Purchases Are Very Strong</h3>
<p>New Copper Has Been Loaded</p>
<p>Since the shortage of 200-pound American Hui Si iron after its arrival, local firms have been reluctant to sell it easily, resulting in a severe shortage of circulating goods in the market. Although Gong He Xiang Osaka and other warehouses had spot goods loaded yesterday, most of them were purchased by cigarette factories, and the market inventory is still scarce. The standard asking price remains firm. Old steel factory goods are quoted at 36 yuan, new steel factory goods at 35 yuan, and wild chicken goods at 34 yuan. It was found that over 800 boxes were opened throughout the city yesterday, purchased by cigarette companies, canning factories, biscuit companies, etc. However, business from buyer groups remains uneventful.</p>
<p>New copper arrived at Fuming Gong He Xiang wharf with 35 tons. It was found that this was an order placed by a certain Jiujin firm in this city. Since there is no fear of stockout in the market, the market price opened at 56 yuan per dan, which is more than one yuan higher than before. It is heard that firms from Tianjin and Hankou have released over 100 dan, and colleagues in the local street have also released dozens of dan.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Spot Blue Lead Iron; Prices Soar</h3>
<p>There is a sudden shortage of spot blue lead iron recently, so buyers in the market are even more enthusiastic, and the market price has soared to 31 yuan per box, which is one yuan higher than before. It was found that Hankou merchants purchased 50 boxes yesterday, and local thermos bottle factories, cigarette factories, etc. also purchased over 280 boxes, so the circulating goods are becoming scarcer. Therefore, there is hope for a continued improvement in the asking price. According to foreign firm news, there may be no arrivals of this product in the next two to three months, and it is expected that the market prospects will become even more soaring.</p>
<h3>Finance in the Past Year (9)</h3>
<p>—He Boxiong</p>
<p>8.  New Trends and Changes in the Financial Industry</p>
<p>The new trends in the financial industry this year are as follows:</p>
<p>Centralized Clearing of Silver Shops; Banks and silver shops are divided into two major groups. Therefore, the clearing house of silver shops—the General Clearing Association—does not communicate with the clearing house of banks. After the Shanghai financial turmoil in June of last year, both banks and silver shops felt that there was no way to deal with this serious situation without taking a unified step. Therefore, the Silver Shop Joint Reserve and the Bank Clearing House agreed that all bills received by silver shops from banks would be left to the Silver Shop Joint Reserve for collection, and bills received by banks from silver shops would also be left to the representatives of the Clearing House for collection. Among them, there are 55 member silver shops on the silver shop side and 37 member banks on the bank side. From then on, the silver and money industries, which have always been divided, began to cooperate, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Lending and Investment in Agricultural Land; This phenomenon is the biggest characteristic of the past year and a contribution of the banking industry. Therefore, the Farmers Bank of the four provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi was reorganized into the "Farmers Bank of China" on April 1st of last year, with its capital increased to 10 million yuan, and branches were added in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Hunan, and other places, specializing in rural business and providing relief to rural areas. In addition, the "Agricultural Cooperative Loan Group" was initiated by five banks, including Bank of Communications, Jincheng, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial Bank, and Farmers Bank. It was officially established in Shanghai on February 9th of last year and implemented in Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces. It organized cooperatives for cotton, wheat, rice, tea, to use green seedling loans, and also set up warehouses for the mortgage of agricultural products, responsible for transportation and sales, to facilitate the export of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Rise of Small-Scale Credit Loans; This type of loan uses credit as collateral for the borrowing needs of ordinary citizens without collateral. Since the establishment of Shanghai Bank, banks have launched it one after another last year, including Xinhua, Juxingcheng, China, Guohuo, Shanghai Trust, Tongyixin Trust, Zhongnan, Ningbo Industrial, and Siming Savings Association. Last year, it developed extremely rapidly.</p>
<p>Resumption of Acceptance of Real Estate Mortgages by Silver Shops; Real estate mortgages have been sluggish since the 22nd year due to the urgency of bank funds and the sharp drop in land prices. Last year, they have all been doing it in moderation, so real estate has been more active than in the previous year.</p>
<p>Promotion of Commercial Acceptance Bills by Silver Shops; Since the large outflow of domestic silver has left the market with a deep lack of chips, in order to increase chips and turn over finances, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry and the Electrical and Mechanical Silk Weaving Industry used commercial acceptance bills. The Shanghai Banking Industry Association held a meeting on April 9th and passed six principles for the acceptance bill discount business. The Shanghai Silver Shop Association held a meeting on April 10th and passed the implementation principles of commercial acceptance bills, and notified all the shops of the industry that they should accept the above-mentioned bills as much as possible for the regular business. The implementation of commercial acceptance bills may gradually be promoted from this day on.</p>

<h3>Treating Illness, Strengthening the Body, Reversing Decline, and Reviving Weakness</h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>There are eight main glands in the human body, among which the reproductive glands are the most important. If the reproductive glands atrophy or become abnormal, the body's resistance to disease will immediately disappear. As a result, weakness, decline, and diseases arise. Targeted medication should use reproductive gland preparations. Here is an example to prove it.</p>
<h3>"Reproductive Hormone"</h3>
<p>Last autumn, a patient named Mr. Xu Qing'an complained of lower back pain, body weakness, blood deficiency, facial decline, brain weakness, insomnia, and other symptoms. I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Hormone" from the Sino-British Pharmacy. All his ailments were eliminated, and he quickly became strong and healthy, returning to his youthful state of many years ago.</p>
<h3>External Rub for Rheumatism</h3>

<h3>Example of Completely Curing Long-Term Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Cao Yunxiang) I have suffered from stomach pain for a long time. It's not that I haven't been treated, but the medicine is not right for the symptoms and the effect is lacking, resulting in procrastination and lingering untreated. Not only do I belch and vomit, but I also have acid regurgitation and paroxysmal pain, making it difficult to bear. My appetite is weak and my digestion is weak, leading to nutritional imbalance and gradual weight loss. (Omitted) Last month, I was fortunate to be introduced by Mr. Lu Shutang to purchase the famous medicine "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Element" from Taihe Pharmacy. Because "Stomach Pain Relief" has the functions of eliminating inflammation, neutralizing acid, protecting the membrane, regenerating, relieving pain, and stopping vomiting, my ailments were completely cured. And "Stomach Strengthening Element" has the great power of strengthening the stomach and transforming the weak stomach. Therefore, after taking it, my appetite increased, my digestion became stronger, and I quickly regained my health with sufficient nutrition. My long-term illness has been relieved. If the famous medicine did not have miraculous effects, how could it have achieved this? Therefore, I record the beginning and end to express my gratitude and will introduce it to others.</p>

<p>Can be purchased from pharmacies yourself: Tinct Iodii, Glycerine aa 4 qian</p>
<p>(Usage) When it first starts and is not ulcerated, apply and rub on the surface once in the morning and once in the evening.</p>
<h3>Healthy and Beautiful Breast Development</h3>
<p>Savior of Blacklisted Women</p>
<p>(Report from Physician Wang Shiying) Last autumn, Mr. Zou Baoren accompanied his wife to seek help with quitting her smoking addiction. I observed that her face was full of smoke, haggard and sallow, and her body was thin and weak, losing her health and beauty. After examination, I learned that Mrs. Zou also suffered from leukorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and other symptoms. I immediately instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Hormone" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Relief" for external use from Wuzhou Pharmacy. Internal and external applications were used according to the method. Because "Female Reproductive Hormone" has the functions of strengthening the uterus, eliminating inflammation, regulating menstruation, treating leukorrhea, removing toxins, quitting addiction, strengthening the body, and curing diseases, the ailments were eliminated and the smoking addiction was also broken. Not only did the smoky appearance disappear, but also the breasts developed, fully expressing the health and beauty that a young woman should have.</p>
<h3>Internal Wind-Dampness, Residual Toxins Not Cleared</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Patient Ma Guofen came for consultation last winter, complaining of sore joints and numbness in her hands and feet. After repeated treatments, none had a great effect. I immediately requested to examine her old prescriptions, which focused solely on removing wind-dampness. However, my diagnosis of Mr. Ma's illness was still due to uncleared residual toxins. I immediately instructed her to purchase "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" from Yong'an Company. After taking them, she felt comfortable in her bones and meridians, and her hands and feet also felt flexible. Her ailment was finally cured.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea, Kidney Weakness, Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>(Letter from Mr. Yuan Chongpei) I committed masturbation when I was young, relying on my strength and health without remorse. I excessively consumed my essence, resulting in spermatorrhea. Repeated treatments were ineffective, and my body became weaker day by day. After marriage, I suffered even more from premature ejaculation, and my kidneys were weak and small, making life dull. (Omitted) Last autumn, I was fortunate to be introduced by Mr. Shi Zuyi to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng for treatment. I received electrotherapy, which was painless. I was instructed to purchase "Hemet's Spermatorrhea Pills" from Sino-French Pharmacy to treat my spermatorrhea, and "Reproductive Hormone" to treat my kidney weakness. The effects were great, and my ailment was completely cured. Now I am strong and healthy, and life has been revived. Recalling the previous merits, it is truly difficult to forget.</p>

<p>Patient Chen Tianbo, 46 years old, from Beijing. (Chief Complaint) - Spermatorrhea, kidney weakness, stomach pain, painful smoking cessation. (Medical History) - Mr. Chen suffered from stomach disease more than ten years ago due to dietary indiscretion. Paroxysmal pain occurred frequently, making it difficult to bear. Taking medicine temporarily stopped it, but the disease progressed over time and the medicine lost its effectiveness. He had no choice but to listen to friends and smoke to relieve it, which led to addiction. He repeatedly tried to quit but failed. In addition, Mr. Chen married early and overworked, and his sexual performance declined, suffering from kidney weakness, spermatorrhea, stomach pain, and mental weakness, making it difficult to fully quit smoking. Last winter, he personally visited my clinic for help. (Treatment) I instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Hormone" from Sino-Western Pharmacy to nourish his spirit and remove his addiction, and to treat his stomach disease with "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Element". "Hemet's Spermatorrhea Pills" treated his spermatorrhea, and he was able to happily quit his addiction. He was able to fully quit smoking safely.</p>

(Medical History) Mr. Pan committed masturbation in his youth, secretly depleting his essence, which caused considerable damage. He suffered from spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission. After marriage, he also suffered from premature ejaculation, thin semen, brain weakness, insomnia, and forgetfulness, making it difficult to bear. Life was lost, and his wife complained. Last winter, he was introduced by his relative to seek treatment.

<p>(Clinic) Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>Relief from Physical and Mental Suffering.</p>
<p>Patient: Mrs. Liu, age 29. (Chief Complaint) – Leukorrhea turned red. Menstrual cramps. Fatigue and weakness. Dizziness and blurred vision. (Medical History) – Mrs. Liu had a weak constitution from birth and was generally sickly. She took medicine constantly. Her menstruation was consistently late, with irregular and variable flow. After marriage, she became weaker due to household chores. She has had leukorrhea for three years, which recently turned red, alarming her. She was brought by her husband for treatment. (Treatment) – I diagnosed Mrs. Liu's weakness as stemming from the decline of her reproductive glands, which could not be effectively treated by other remedies. I prescribed oral "Female Reproductive Essence" to be purchased from the New Asia Company, along with external application of "Leukorrhea Remedy." Through both internal and external applications, and targeted treatment, her symptoms disappeared. Her body became strong and healthy, and her breasts developed in a way never seen before, she says.</p>

<p>Patient: Le Guanhua, age 33, from Zhenhai, businessman. (Chief Complaint) – Kidney deficiency, lower back pain, joint pain, and physical weakness. (Medical History) – Mr. Le frequently engaged in social activities in the business world, frequenting pleasure quarters like a second home. He contracted venereal disease, which was fortunately cured. However, because the residual toxins were not completely cleared and his vitality was excessively depleted, he suffered from the aforementioned symptoms. Last autumn, he was introduced by a close friend for treatment. (Treatment) – I diagnosed Mr. Le's condition as stemming from the decline of his reproductive glands, compounded by lingering toxins. I prescribed targeted medication, recommending he purchase "Reproductive Essence" and "Strong Stone's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Huamei Pharmacy. Because the root cause was addressed, the treatment was remarkably effective, achieving complete and miraculous results within a month or so.</p>

<p>Special Telegram Supplement</p>
<h3>A Study on the Classification of Telephone Subscribers</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Although telephone subscribers all use telephones for the same purpose – to transmit messages – their characteristics differ, leading to variations in telephone usage frequency. For example, while hotels, restaurants, and private residences all have telephones, hotels and restaurants invariably use them more frequently than residences. Therefore, treating all subscribers as a single category regardless of their characteristics is not only unfair but also overly vague. Just as telegrams are classified into government, public, private, charitable, and other categories, telephones should be as well.</p>
<p>Classifying telephone subscribers has long been practiced in Europe and America, proving very convenient. In the past, telephone bureaus in China had divergent practices, with some classifying subscribers and others not. Those that did classify had no uniform standards, resulting in unfair burdens on subscribers. It was not until the Ministry of Communications drafted the "General Regulations for Municipal Telephone Operations" last year that Article 6 stipulated dividing telephone subscribers into four categories (A, B, C, and D) based on their characteristics. Article 7 further stipulated: "If there is doubt regarding a telephone subscriber's category, the local bureau shall determine it based on the nature of telephone usage, and the subscriber shall not object. If the nature of a subscriber's business changes, it must be reported immediately." These regulations were implemented by telephone bureaus across the country after being promulgated. At the same time, the Ministry of Communications re-approved telephone tariffs for various bureaus based on local conditions. Except for a few bureaus with few subscribers and simple operations, where monthly fees for all telephone types remain the same, all other locations have adopted tariffs based on the characteristics of the four categories (A, B, C, and D) to ensure fairness. Generally speaking, monthly fees for categories C and B are higher than those for categories A and D, reflecting the cost based on their nature.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the above regulations, convenience has been widely acknowledged. However, it has been heard that a very small number of subscribers are not very clear about it. For example, some subscribers who should have been classified as Category B were previously incorrectly classified as Category A. After the new regulations were implemented, they were corrected to Category B, which led to suspicion due to the monthly fee increasing by one yuan. In fact, this suspicion is entirely a misunderstanding. These regulations were originally intended to fairly distribute the burden on subscribers, not to raise prices. In reality, those subscribers who previously paid higher monthly fees due to incorrect categorization have been uniformly reduced. Initially, the Ministry of Communications did not consider the loss of business in order to achieve rationality. Once this misunderstanding is explained, it will surely be understood.</p>
<h3>Several Issues Worth Noting for Long-Distance Telephone Subscribers</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>Long-distance telephones and wireless telegraphs are both useful tools for modern communication. To facilitate public communication, the Ministry of Communications is actively constructing long-distance telephone networks, in addition to reorganizing and expanding wireless telegraphs throughout the country. Examples include the opening of long-distance telephones in various provinces, the construction of the nine-province long-distance telephone trunk line, and the expansion of long-distance telephone lines along the Xi'an Highway. As long-distance telephones are utilized by the public, users will inevitably come into contact with local telegraph bureaus, telephone bureaus, or long-distance telephone retail outlets (hereinafter referred to as "telephone bureaus"). The following items should be carefully noted in order to make full use of the service and avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The Language Used During Conversations Must Be Simple and Concise: When sending telegrams, the text must be concise and meaningful because telegrams are charged per word. Long-distance telephones are now charged every three minutes. Time exceeded is charged as two calls. Therefore, the language used by the caller and receiver during long-distance phone calls must be simple and concise. All unnecessary language should be avoided to prevent increasing the call cost.</p>
<p>Procedures for Temporarily Requesting a Rush Call: Anyone who has paid for an ordinary call at the telephone bureau's cashier and finds that the line is busy and their call is later in the queue may request a rush call by presenting the original receipt for the ordinary call and paying the additional fee at the cashier. The cashier should verify that the original receipt has not been used, and the additional fees have been paid (e.g., if a rush call costs 9 jiao, they only need to pay an additional 4 jiao 5 fen, since the price for a rush call is double the ordinary call price). They should then issue a new receipt for the rush call, which the caller can take to the telephone operator to move up the call priority. By doing so, callers who urgently need to speak with the other party can avoid a long wait.</p>
<p>The following briefly describes how to cancel a long-distance telephone call and request a refund:</p>
<p>(A) If the originating bureau has connected to the terminating bureau, and the terminating bureau has connected to the called party's telephone, but the called party does not answer the phone, the situation is similar to that where the terminating bureau has been contacted and dispatched a messenger, but the called party's address is unknown and cannot be delivered, or the called party does not answer the call after being notified. In these cases, the telephone bureau that collected the fees should deduct one-third of the call fee, and the remaining fees should be refunded to the caller. However, if the called party is unable to answer the call due to a temporary fault in the installed telephone or municipal telephone line, or other similar circumstances, and the terminating bureau verifies that this is the case, the telephone bureau should refund all fees paid by the caller.</p>
<p>(B) Recently, in order to provide better service to users, the Ministry of Communications has specially stipulated that if a user has registered with the telephone bureau and paid for an ordinary call, but has not been connected within four hours; or has registered with the telephone bureau and paid for a rush call, but has not been connected within two hours, regardless of the reason, if the user does not wish to wait any longer, they may request cancellation of the call free of charge. All fees paid, including incidental fees, can be refunded in full by the telephone bureau without deducting any costs.</p>
<p>(C) A long-distance user registered at telephone bureau A has registered with the bureau to call a certain number in location B. If the user at that number in location B has also pre-registered at telephone bureau B to call the user in location A, and after being connected, the user in location A requests to cancel the call they originally placed because they have already spoken to the user at a certain number in location B, if it is verified that the call was based on the number registered by the user at that number in location B, and telephone bureau A has not yet recorded that the call from telephone bureau A to telephone bureau B was connected, the call can be cancelled free of charge. However, if the call was based on the number registered by the user at location B, but telephone bureau A has already recorded that the call from the user at location A to telephone bureau B was connected, the request to cancel the call by the user in location A should be subject to the temporary cancellation of the call at one-third of the charge for the call, which will be deducted from the prepaid fees.</p>
<p>There are four types of calls, which are described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Ordinary Call: If the caller only wants to call a certain telephone number in a certain place and does not specify the name of the person to be called, such as Nanjing municipal telephone number (31728). This type of call only recognizes the number and not the person. Once connected to the called number, the call time is calculated from the time the call is answered, regardless of who answers the phone, and the fees are charged at the ordinary call rate.</p>
<p>(B) Rush Call: If the caller does not wish to wait according to the ordinary registration queue, they may register for a rush call and pay double the price of an ordinary call, thereby obtaining the priority to make the call earlier.</p>
<p>(C) Messenger Call: This type of call is applicable when the called party does not have a municipal telephone installed. For example, if Wen Zhiren in Shanghai wants to call Ma Luheng at No. 1 Louzi Lane, Nanjing, he must register for a messenger call with the telephone bureau. In addition to paying the fees as required, a special delivery fee of 1 jiao must also be paid. The above call should be dispatched by the terminating bureau to notify the called party to listen to the call at the terminating bureau or a public telephone booth. However, the messenger range is limited to 5 kilometers from the bureau. The caller may also pre-determine the time for the other party to answer the call. If the caller uses this pre-determination method, in addition to paying the call fee and special delivery fee, one-third of the ordinary call fee should be added as the pre-determination fee. After the caller obtains the receipt and notifies the operator at the call office to send out the pre-determination notice, they can leave the bureau and go elsewhere. When the pre-determined time is near, they can go to the call office to make the call.</p>
<p>(D) Advance Notice: If, in addition to the telephone number of the other party being called, the caller also wants to talk to a specified person, such as Sun Cuiying, extension number (258) of Nanjing telephone (31131). Since this call is an advance notice, the caller should add one-third of the ordinary call fee in addition to the call fee.</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone users will find it very convenient to use the service if they thoroughly understand the above items.</p>

<h3>Talking About Things That Telegram Senders Often Neglect (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Weili</p>
<p>Do Not Send Personal Private Matters on Government Telegram Forms</p>
<p>Article 11 of the Amended Regulations on the Collection and Restriction of Fees for Official Military Telegrams stipulates that telegrams shall not involve private matters. If the bureau discovers that the content of a telegram involves private matters, it shall detain the telegram and submit the telegram for examination by the Ministry of Communications. It is often seen that telegram senders use official telegram forms to request the sending of private telegrams in an attempt to save money, which is only natural. However, those who can use official telegram forms should be able to pay the telegram fee, or do they think it is a glory to use this form? If private matters are involved, it violates the regulations, and the telegram will be detained. Attempting to save money will delay important matters and harm both oneself and others! Telegrams are state-run enterprises, and using official telegram forms to send private telegrams is tantamount to harming state revenue. Recently, a newspaper reported that a certain foreign woman in Nanjing had repeatedly used her friend's free ticket to ride the train. Knowing that this was wrong, she sent the 200+ yuan for the car fee to the Ministry of Finance for transfer to the Ministry of Railways. This kind of public morality is worth praising. Those who use official telegram forms to send private telegrams should be alert to this.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>When sending ordinary private cipher telegrams, in addition to the ciphered telegram text being self-translated, the recipient's name, address, and signature, etc., only the written text should be used. If you need the code to be translated, you should charge a translation fee per word. However, the recipient's name and address are based on the number of words charged. For example, if the recipient's name and address does not exceed ten words, a translation fee of three cents will be charged. If the sender translates it themselves, all clear text must be annotated with text so that the telegraph officer can calculate the telegraph fee and proofread the code.</p>
<p>Private telegrams are divided into ordinary and express types. Express telegrams are charged double the normal fee. In addition, there are no words such as "most urgent," "extremely urgent," "specially urgent," or "flying urgent." In the era of warlords, these strange titles were often abused on official telegram forms. Currently, there are only two fee identification marks in official telegrams: "urgent" and "specially urgent." In ordinary private telegrams, other than the "express" fee identification mark, other marks are not applicable. If the sender wants to send an express telegram, they can add the word "express" at the bottom of the telegram. Please do not write it in the telegram text to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>When sending private cipher telegrams, do not translate the recipient's name and address into a code, making it impossible for the telegraph bureau to deliver it. The signature of ciphered official telegrams shall not be written in code, which violates the provisions of Article 2 of the "Amended Regulations on Collection and Restriction of Fees for Official Military Telegrams."</p>

<p>Criminals and Wireless Radio</p>
<p>Wireless radio is not only a tool for transportation but also a tool for promoting culture and cultivating sentiment. In Europe, it has become a good form of entertainment for criminals. In Germany, high-ranking criminals are allowed to listen to it every day. In Czechoslovakia, criminals are allowed to listen to music and some educational programs. In Switzerland, radios are installed in prison corridors so that all criminals can enjoy the programs. Headphones are installed in Belgian prisons so that criminals can listen to designated programs. In Denmark, criminals serving short-term prison sentences are allowed to listen to free radio broadcasts. Headphones are also installed in prisons in the United States, and a prisoner broadcasting team is organized to broadcast once a week.</p>
<p>Small Radios that Protect Aircraft</p>
<p>A very small radio has recently been installed in a British seaport. The electricity used is minimal, even less than the electricity used by the flashlight in your pocket. It is designed to protect aircraft traveling between England and France. This machine is equipped with a ten-foot-long aluminum reflector. The concentration of sound waves is like light, directly passing through the two coasts, one in Saint-Inglevert, France, and the other in Lydd, England, 35 miles apart. Every time an aircraft flies high above it, a message is sent to the two stations. If there is an obstacle in the aircraft, and the pilot urgently needs to land on the water, the stations can rush to help after receiving the message.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— (Rong Yu)</p>
<p>When listening to people talk about the shortcomings of others, one will happily chime in. But when others are praising someone, one feels unhappy. If this kind of prejudice and selfishness can be overcome, one will be the first fair person in the world.</p>
<p>In today's society, one cannot speak of "righteousness" in making friends. As long as one can "mutually praise" rather than "mutually expose" behind one's back, it is already not an easy thing.</p>
<p>Children cry and laugh genuinely. By adulthood, crying and laughing are not genuine, and faces are all fake. After all, "knowledge" and "experience" are also things that teach people to commit crimes and do evil.</p>
<p>When a person reaches a place where the law cannot sanction them and etiquette cannot restrain them, regardless of whether they are intelligent or foolish, they are generally no different from animals.</p>
<p>It is indeed not a brave thing to have thoughts of death because of a harsh environment. However, there are also many people who cannot uphold their integrity and willingly degenerate. Comparing the two, the former is more valuable after all.</p>
<h3>Two-Faced Person</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>There is an old Mr. Dong living in my residence. He is already approaching sixty years old. He has such a solemn appearance, with a face that embodies "do not speak of what is improper, do not look at what is improper." He always speaks to us young people with an extremely serious demeanor. Whenever young people drink a few sips of alcohol, play a few rounds of cards, or say a word or two of playful jokes to young girls, they are sure to receive his lectures for half a day.</p>
<p>Young people naturally cannot help but be somewhat disgruntled with his lectures for no reason. However, he is reasonable and loves to say, "I don't like to meddle in other people's business. It's just that you are a promising young man, and I always feel it's a pity for you to do such things, so I can't help but say a few more words." Naturally, whoever has such a large hat placed on them can only blush and repeatedly say "yes, yes, yes," and has nothing else to say. Therefore, the young people in our house, although they can be honest in front of their wives when acting out of the ordinary, are very careful in front of old Mr. Chen and absolutely dare not reveal any hint of it.</p>
<p>One day, I went to visit a friend. Amidst the aroma of wine and meat wafting from the adjacent room, I suddenly heard a burst of very familiar laughter. However, I couldn't remember who it was at the moment. So, I peeked through the crack in the door. As luck would have it, the one laughing with his mouth wide open and not yet closed was none other than that serious old Mr. Chen. His face was as red as if it were stained with pig's blood, and his collar was open, making him even more undignified than us young people. According to my friend, this old Mr. Chen often plays with my friend's father. Drinking goes without saying, and he can play thirty-two rounds of cards in one go. On one occasion, my friend even saw him teasing a girl he called out from the brothel to the point of tears. It is said that this old Mr. Chen is the most playful among several older generations of old men.</p>
<p>This is truly a two-faced person, who can truly be said to speak human language to humans and ghost language to ghosts. Ever since I discovered his secret, I have repeatedly wanted to expose him. But on second thought, I should be more loyal and let him continue to pretend. However, after that time, whenever I see him being serious and lecturing me, I can only feel that it is an utter farce in my heart.</p>
<h3>Old Man Huang</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>It has been two or three years since I last saw Old Man Huang. Recently, I suddenly and coincidentally met him again in a familiar business shop, which instantly brought back many memories of this strange Old Man Huang.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Old Man Huang, everyone who knows him considers him to be a special person. He is already forty-eight years old this year. However, he still lives a solitary life. Although some people have been matchmakers for him, hoping he would start a family, he is unwilling, often saying: "What use are women? I hate women the most. Why do I need a son? Can't I spend my own money? Do I definitely need women and sons to help me spend it?" In general, people see that he has a special personality, so no one has mentioned being a matchmaker to him lately! However, behind his back, they always say: Old Man Huang is a rare eccentric.</p>
<p>In addition to not wanting women, Old Man Huang has another strange thing worth writing about here: that is, he vowed never to cut off the braid on his head. If anyone wanted to persuade him to cut off his braid, Old Man Huang would shake his head and wag his tail, and hum loudly: "My body and hair are received from my parents and must not be damaged. How can I cut off the hair that my parents passed on to me?" Therefore, to this day, Old Man Huang's tail has been more than two feet long! People who see it always laugh at him. But Old Man Huang doesn't care at all, and he still deals with people with a smile. However, recently, because he is the only one left in the village with a braid, he has also coiled up his braid and covered it with a hat. Perhaps this is also where Old Man Huang knows what is appropriate.</p>
<h3>Switched Nests of Luan and Phoenix (Legend of a Strange Case)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near the Double Ninth Festival, a Secluded Gathering; Recalling Old Dreams in Linked Pearls, Regretting a Thousand Years</p>
<p>I heard him say it so earnestly and solemnly, and I said: Brother Lan, you are too loyal to your friends. This matter may have a considerable relationship with you, right? Otherwise, why would you be so concerned? Lan Chang did not reply to this sentence, but just smiled and smoked. When I saw this situation, I felt that there were many mysteries inside. The opportunity should not be lost. I replied magnanimously and said: Okay, as long as you set a date, I will definitely go. Fortunately, it is a very easy trip to and from Shanghai to Suzhou in one day. When he saw that I had agreed, it seemed as if a very important thing had been accomplished as he wished. Just looking at his face revealed a smile. I repeated my promise and said: You set a date, and I will definitely arrive. You can believe in my character, and I will never casually break my promise in front of a friend. The smile on his face still had not disappeared. At this time, he put down the cigarette in his hand, opened the big leather bag that he put on the chair, immediately took out a long letter with an antique stone-printed pattern, a long letter made of Xuan paper, handed it to me with both hands, and said with a smile: This is this Sunday, two days before the Double Ninth Festival. I will wait for you at my humble home in Suzhou at 1 PM sharp. I felt that he had hidden the invitation in his bag in advance. He really wanted to invite me as a guest. I really should not often fail my good friend's kindness. Therefore, three days after our conversation, I took the early train from Shanghai North Railway Station to Suzhou. It just happened to be a sunny day after a drizzle, and people who went out could feel a sense of relaxation in their spirits. Lan Chang's home is in a deep alley past the park. Along the stone-paved sidewalk, there is a row of silver-gray powder walls. There is a white stone inscription on the semi-circular door, which is a collection of Huang Shiguzi's words "Secluded Orchid Cottage." From this, one can know that the owner is paying attention everywhere. Before entering the door, I saw a cluster of green bamboo on the wall, waving in the wind, as if telling people that it is very elegant inside. After entering the door, unlike ordinary families with gardens in Suzhou, a very tasteless spare lane flashed out. Here, there is a neat row of mountain fan and a row of cypress, with the tips trimmed flat and standing next to a winding path, leading to a flower garden. Without having to walk close, one can see from a distance that deep yellow and light purple are dispersing large clusters of chrysanthemums among the green trees and light grass. Before arriving at the garden, it makes people feel refreshed and know that the owner has a plan in his heart. While I was looking at it, Lan Chang had already come out with a red face, beads of sweat on his forehead, and a smile. From afar, he stretched out his hand and shook hands with me, and said with a smile: My brother is truly a man of his word. I also laughed and said: How dare I break my promise to my brother? He smiled and took my hand, followed a pebble path, and then passed through a row of square flower fences. It was Lan Chang's home. (3)</p>
<h3>Record of What Was Seen</h3>
<p>— (Xie Yun)</p>
<p>Whenever I stroll to the train station, I often see groups of yellow cattle being led from the train onto the ground. Perhaps due to excessive hunger, they are all very thin. When they are led out, because they have been standing for too long, sometimes they cannot step over the wooden planks to reach the ground. The cattle drivers then repeatedly whip them. These poor creatures can only struggle with all their strength, uttering one or two hoarse cries. Some collapse on the ground, unable to stand up for a long time. It takes a lot of effort to drive this group of yellow cattle off the train, and then they slowly tie them together in teams of three, driving them towards the slaughterhouse. I watch as this group of yellow cattle stumbles along the road, being led by the nose to be slaughtered!</p>
<p>Talking to the staff at the station, they can't help but sigh repeatedly. The rural areas are bankrupt, and the farmers have no way to make a living, so they have to sell their cattle, which are like their second life, at a low price to temporarily solve their living problems. They no longer expect to cultivate and harvest in the future. Unexpectedly, the rural bankruptcy has also brought disaster to these poor creatures! I look at the shadows of this group of yellow cattle disappearing on the road and cannot help but sigh deeply!</p>
<h3>Wildfire</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The two characters "Wildfire" seem like very common words at first glance. But if you trace their origin, they can be found in the mouths of Tang dynasty poets, in the lines "Wildfire burns endlessly, the spring breeze blows it back to life." Think about it, doesn't that have a very long history? Enough small talk, let me tell you about the recent "wildfire burning" incident in Jiading for your readers to hear.</p>
<p>It seems that this kind of trend has always existed! Even now, it still cannot be avoided. Even within the city walls, not just in the countryside, people will take a desolate and deserted piece of grassland and burn it to the ground, as if it were scorched earth. This is really a terrible thing; the fire started right behind the City God Temple, not far from a certain school. A few days ago, it unknowingly burned like a prairie fire, turning everything black. I heard that someone dropped a spark? In that case, it must have been some mischievous children who didn't know the severity of the situation, simply indulging in their momentary fun, not caring if it burned onto someone's dead relatives!</p>
<p>Hmph! It burned for a long time. Although the weather was cold, the fire took advantage of the power of the northeast wind and became even more fierce. As a result, two coffins of the floating burial site of a certain family on the wasteland were almost burned to charcoal. Moreover, no one noticed it at first until passersby saw it from afar, then they realized the trouble that had been caused. Because the coffins of the floating burial sites were definitely covered with straw on top and around them, which is most likely to catch fire. It would be much better if bricks and tiles were used to surround them. But poor families with no money, how could they have thought that this day would come!</p>
<p>Later, when the matter was exposed, the certain family whose coffins were burned was not willing to let it go. It is said that the parents of the children who started the wildfire paid some money to settle the matter. I don't know if it's true or not? One child was watching the fire burning fiercely and felt as if cold water was being poured on his back. As a result, he developed a fever that night, and despite all kinds of treatments, he could not be saved after a few days. Alas! This kind of thing is really unacceptable. Teachers who educate children, I hope you will talk about these things in your daily lessons and let them listen.</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3>Guixi Tianshi Mansion and Shangqing Palace</h3>
<p>— Shufan</p>
<p>Last month on the 15th, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities held a ceremony in Nanchang to celebrate the opening of the Yushan-Nanchang section of the railway. I represented the Yousheng Travel Group to attend. After three nights in Yuzhang, I had already enjoyed the local scenery. On the 18th, I returned alone to Yingtan in Guixi, taking the road to Shangqing to explore the scenic spots of Dao Ling. There is a highway to Shangqing, which takes only an hour by car. Unfortunately, due to the recent melting snow, it was not suitable for cars, so I switched to a "goat cart." For fifteen miles, the population was sparse, and it really felt like there were more tombs than houses! After another seven miles, we arrived at Longmabu, the edge of Shangqing Town. The local militia had strict checkpoints, with blockhouses guarding the four corners. It was almost impossible for hundreds of people to break through. After a simple meal, I was told about the local customs and scenic spots. The pleasant and shocking stories kept me listening tirelessly until midnight. After going to bed, using grass as a pillow, my body felt strangely warm. Hearing the sound of dogs barking like a tide in the surrounding fields, I felt uneasy. The green lamp was like a bean, and the red beacon light was close to the clouds. The host said that this was the scene during the height of the Red Disaster. After tossing and turning, dawn finally broke. Gradually, I heard people talking in the town, and I quickly urged my companions to set out. Following the stream to the east, the Nine Dragon Mountains stretched endlessly. The water vapor rose, binding the mountainside like a white rainbow. The morning sun illuminated it, changing from a faint purple to a pure green, until it was clear and clean. Thus, the strange, magnificent, clear, and ancient secrets within dozens of miles were all revealed. A little further ahead is the Tianshi Mansion. The huge building faces the stream, with a straight path like an arrow. The realm of Qingxu (pure void) is more solemn than a government office. From the front gate to the inner pavilion, there are four halls, totaling 373 steps. Plaques hang everywhere, as brilliant as ever. On the second path, there is a stone well. It is said that the Heavenly Master used to imprison demons here. Applying the water to the skin can prevent heat rash in the hot summer. The guide spoke of it with certainty, but I dared not believe it. Entering Jin Guang Gate and turning to the Heavenly Master's resting place, the courtyard is full of flowers and plants. An old woman is sweeping the floor. The whitewashed walls and red pillars are adorned with paintings and calligraphy. A blessed person, indeed knowing what is important. However, peeking into the inner room, the rope bed is stuffed with grass, and the reeds are worn through at the bottom, it is still difficult to hide the signs of decline after the disaster. To the west is the Talisman Room, with the inscription "Lofty Virtue and Dignity" in the center. The two corridors are extremely wide. It is said that in the early years of the Republic, those seeking talismans would still pile up in the courtyard every day. Now, the price of talismans is nominal, and no one asks about them. Such is the rise and fall, how can the people in the midst of it not sigh endlessly! Opening the west door again, we reach the Ten Thousand Laws Altar. Four ancient cypress trees shade the courtyard. Hundreds of statues of thunder gods make it too gloomy to stay for long. Before the mansion was looted by bandits, there were guards at the gate and officials in the rooms. Without sincerity, there was no way to enter. Without offerings, there was no way to be seen. Yet, the gentry and wealthy merchants still did not hesitate to seek it. Who would have thought that after three or four years, it would be desolate to this extent!</p>
<p>Leaving the Tianshi Mansion and walking east along the stream, the sand and stones gradually become visible, and the sound of the water becomes more intense. I walked while listening, finally reaching the Shangqing Palace. The chaotic peaks formed a rushing momentum, making it impossible to move forward. The one towering elegantly to the east is Elephant Mountain, where Mr. Lu Jinxi of the Song Dynasty lectured. Mount Tai is located to the north, as if wanting to rise up and challenge it. Looking south, the Holy Well Mountain range, with overlapping ridges and peaks, extends endlessly. Entering the palace gate, it is as deep as a vaulted passage, with stone walls surrounding the caves, creating a unique architectural style. Passing the dismounting pavilion to the stone que, the walls are still as intact as ever. Going further, the weeds reach the knees. It is said that the three halls and twenty-four courtyards of the past no longer exist. I heard that when the Mao bandit Zedong occupied Shangqing in the eighteenth year, he first burned the palace, and then tortured the private savings of the magistrates of various courtyards. The severity of the disaster was unprecedented by Hong Yang. Inspecting the ruins, besides the stone base, only the Di Lou is worth commemorating. Asking about the location of the gongs, drums, talisman swords, it is a desolate and sad scene! The bell was cast at the end of the Han Dynasty and contained a lot of gold. After the looting, someone from a certain country offered 100,000 taels of gold, but the person in charge refused, so now it is heavily locked to prevent it from being moved abroad. About a hundred steps to the left, luckily surviving the fire, is the Eastern Hermitage Courtyard, now inhabited by Taoist Zeng Weiyi. Ancient trees and empty windows provide a place to hide secrets and secluded treasures. It is almost the Lu Lingguang Hall of this place. The courtyard enshrines the statue of Dao Ling, cast in bronze and painted in blue, revered as a deity. According to Weiyi, when the Red atmosphere was strong, rebellious people gathered to loot it and placed it in a toilet in Guixi. It was not until last year that it was brought back to the courtyard. It has also experienced the changes of the world. Going out to see the Yuan monument, standing tall on the side of the road, all are more than three fathoms high. One was written by Yu Ji and inscribed by Songxue, with a graceful style like that of Beihai. The other is already blurred and eroded, with only "Ordered Minister Ji to write the article, but the Minister is sick and lying in the fields" and ten additional characters still discernible. It is also written by Dao Yuan, I don't know who the scribe is, it is regrettable. I say that the beauty of Shangqing lies in its streams and mountains. Even without the Qingxu Palace and the legacy of the sect, it is still delightful. Moreover, the gold and stone are all inherited from thousands of years ago. Thus, playing with them to observe their subtlety is more than exploring the wonders by inquiring at Yique or searching the ruins of Yin to exhaust the changes. Therefore, I publish this article to inform the people of the country.</p>

<h3>Middle School Textbooks Must "Emphasize Homework"</h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>In preparation for revising the current curriculum standards, the Ministry of Education convened several meetings of experts in various subjects and representatives of publishers last month. At the same time, it also announced several key points for improving the editing of middle school textbooks, instructing that the content of textbooks must: conform to the educational objectives and revised curriculum standards, emphasize the cultivation of national spirit and practical abilities, have balanced and appropriate distribution without repetition or contradiction, be described accurately with clear and smooth language, emphasize homework... etc. Among these, some are related to the selection of teaching materials, and some involve the handling of teaching materials. They are all of great importance to the thorough implementation of the entire educational objectives and the improvement of the actual teaching efficiency in the classroom. If textbooks can be edited according to the above-mentioned standards in the future, there is no doubt that it will have a positive impact on education in our country. Here, the author wants to elaborate on the "emphasize homework" item.</p>
<p>Modern education in our country began in the first year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1862 AD) when the Zongli Yamen requested the Qing court to establish the Tongwen Guan in Beijing. Since then, the books of "New Learning" were produced in response to the needs of the times. Publishers who aimed to publish books on new learning also sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. After the Wuxu Coup, the school system was established, and the imperial examination system was abolished. Formal textbooks then appeared in large numbers. However, from that time until around 1918 or 1919, a period of nearly twenty years, although there were major changes such as the change of dynasties and the reform of the national system and political system, there was no essential change in the editing methods of school textbooks. It was not until the "New Education" advocated by the Dewey school in the United States was introduced after the May Fourth Movement in 1919 that it attracted the attention of the educational circles in our country. Under the new principle of "child-centeredness," the system reform order was promulgated, and the curriculum outline was circulated by the Ministry of Education for trial implementation throughout the country. The name "teaching method" was also changed to "teaching and learning method" at the suggestion of Mr. Tao Xingzhi. As a result, elementary school textbooks also underwent a new transformation under the influence of the trend of the times. Since then, up to now, the content and organization of elementary school textbooks have mostly started from the perspective of child-centeredness, taking into account the physical and mental development of children in every way. In addition to the main text, the "questions" and "homework" columns are always included, so as to stimulate or guide children to think, observe, experiment, and practice. This can be said to be the most concrete and practical gain after the introduction of child-centered education theory into our country, and it is also a major progress in modern education in our country. However, although elementary school textbooks have undergone such a major and meaningful reform, middle school textbooks still maintain their original state. After the promulgation of the Provisional Curriculum Standards in 1929, the standards also stipulated a "homework outline" in addition to listing the teaching material outline. As a result, some textbooks compiled according to the new standards actually included items such as "homework" or "exercises" in addition to the main text. However, upon examination, their content was mostly limited to asking about the content of the textbooks, and there was no other meaning besides making it easier for students to review. This cannot but be said to be a regret. This time, the Ministry of Education specifically listed "emphasize homework" as one of the key points for improving middle school textbooks, which is naturally for a reason. The author deeply hopes that publishers and editors can pay close attention to this aspect in the future.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The inclusion of homework guidance in textbooks has a significant educational effect and has long been recognized by educators. The textbooks published by Kaiming Bookstore have always paid great attention to this aspect. For example, the natural science textbook and social studies textbook suitable for senior elementary schools are considered to be very detailed, and those who use them all praise their convenience. As for middle school textbooks, the new curriculum textbooks for Chinese, civics, zoology, botany, and native geography, which are currently under review, all include a "homework requirements" column to help students engage in various activities to aid memory, thinking, and application, which may make some contributions to secondary education.</p>

<h3>About "Plain House Miscellany"</h3>
<p>— Peixian</p>
<p>Brother Gai:</p>
<p>Thank you for sending me "Plain House Miscellany" last time! I especially like the articles "The Coward," "Cat," and "Long Leisure." "Fortune Teller," "Kitchen God and God of Wealth," "Misused Coexistence and Compromise," "The Fate of the Intellectual Class," "My Middle School Days," "Miscellaneous Memories of the Restoration," "Recollections of a Tense Atmosphere," "The Loneliness of Middle Age," "Confessions of a Prematurely Aged Person," and "To Literary Youth" are also very interesting. When I say "interesting," I mean two things: one is that they have humor, although the humor hides sadness; and two is that the writing evokes a sense of shared experience. For example, the memories of youth, the melancholy of middle age. In my opinion, this melancholy is also a kind of pleasure; in fact, this melancholy is also inevitable. -- My words may sound a bit like Ah Q! The reasoned texts are naturally also based on experience, but they are a bit short.</p>
<p>The preface mentions Jizi. I didn't expect her to pass away at such a young age. Recalling the scene of seeing her as a child at Baima Lake is heart-wrenching. You only wrote a few words, but they contain deep sorrow. This is also the suffering of middle age. Brother Zhu Ziqing</p>

<h3>Reading "Research and Experience" Special Issue of The Chinese Middle School Student Magazine</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhegang</p>
<p>I remember once reading French writer André Gide saying: "I read a certain book, and after reading it, I closed it; I placed it on that shelf on the bookshelf... Even though I forgot the book in which I read that sentence; even though I quickly read that sentence and cannot remember it clearly; even though I can only vaguely recall that sentence... It doesn't matter! I cannot become the 'I' before I continued this sentence again..." At that time, I only felt that this passage was very beautiful and very lovely. However, it was only limited to this "beauty" and this "loveliness." Who knew that today -- after I finished reading this year's January issue of The Chinese Middle School Student "Research and Experience" special issue, this book with ordinary binding, its body lies on that table, clearly lying there. Ah! It is entangled with me all the time, and I can no longer shake it off. This makes me feel endless respect for that Frenchman.</p>
<p>I have to say: "Too touching and too intimate articles are too understanding, too sincere are the friends." This simply forces me to disregard the ugliness of my article and boldly "reflect" a bit. Saying "reflect," it is just that after "feeling," it allows me to calm down a bit -- it can also be said that it allows me to express my endless respect for these "old" youths who have researched and experienced.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school, I often heard classmates say: "This subject is too dry and tasteless, I'm too lazy to read it!" "What's the use of reading this dry stuff?" Even Mr. Chen Hengzhe in the article "Save the Middle School Students" believes that the teaching time for "dry and difficult mathematics" should be reduced. This argument at least suffers from shortsightedness. Like mathematics, physics, chemistry, grammar, and history, in the eyes of most middle school students, they should be classified as "dry and tasteless" and "not very useful" subjects. In this case, please lie down quietly and let the four doctors "My Interest in Arithmetic," "I Wish I Were a Mathematician," "Grammar Karma," and "New Paths in History" diagnose and treat you. Also, Mr. Zeng Guangfang's article "Fifteen Years in a Chemistry Laboratory" contains a research attitude and spirit of hard study, which can at least give a blood transfusion to those impatient students who want to "drive fast."</p>
<p>Blushing, I say: I used to enthusiastically read some tricky books on what article writing methods and how to write -- believing that it would lead me to the path of writing. As a result, I didn't steal any skills, but I tricked myself badly. Now, I understand: Even if I memorize those things for a lifetime, I won't get any benefit in my life; to put it another way: I won't be able to write a decent article in my life. There are probably many such examples among middle school students, so I have to advise you to read Mr. Zhang Tianyi's "Learning to Learn." This text is really doing the work of "extremely practical instructions, teaching us how to learn." Especially the author's kind attitude is really like an intelligent older brother, with a smiling face, patiently telling his not very sensible younger brother.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun's "Talking About My Research" is a short article of only four pages, but what he talks about is very important. He said: "If there is anything else that a novelist should study besides studying 'people,' it is the masterpieces of predecessors and the folk novels passed down through generations." He also said: "When a person starts writing a new chapter, it is best to forget all his old works, it is best to feel like every chapter is the first time he picks up the pen, and strive to get rid of the power of the 'already formed self'." This is such accurate and sincere guidance for middle school students who are just learning to write! In addition, Mr. Zhu Guangqian's "Talking about Reading Poetry and Cultivating Interests," Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's "About Plate Books," and Mr. Lu Jiye's "Floating Life in the Sea of Music" are all good articles on "literary cultivation" that are worth reading.</p>
<p>Not long ago, people often asked me what my aspirations were after graduating from middle school, and I always stared blankly and didn't know how to answer. I'm sure there are many middle school students who suffer from the same problem as me! After careful analysis of the reasons, it is nothing more than the harm caused by the "non-specialized" high school, which makes our interests diversified or turns into pure instrumentalism without any interest. This is thoroughly enlightened in Mr. Yuan Muzhi's "Interest, Aspiration, and Life." To make one's aspirations firm, it is necessary to go through the stage of interest, in which "a concrete and objective understanding of one's abilities" cannot be ignored. Then, organically connect the aspirations and life that have been refined through interest, so that life can be said to be rational. To put it clearly, interest, aspiration, and life must be unified. Also: "If you wait until after graduating from middle school to identify your interests and aspirations, it seems too late and easy to go astray. Conversely, if you decide on your interests and aspirations before completing secondary education, it seems too early and easy to go astray." Young people who are uneasy about their studies should carefully savor the meaning of these two sentences.</p>
<p>The common psychology is that not being able to go to college after graduating from middle school is an unfortunate thing, and "employment" is a last resort. Indeed, in a rational social system, this is an undeniable fact. But in the current society in our country, this psychology is a huge mistake. If you want to study academic subjects calmly in college, that is not "the current thing in China." Rather, unless you first devote yourself to society and find the irrational source of the current social system, and diagnose it with revolutionary means. Therefore, it is extremely wrong for young people, especially middle school students, to despise "employment." If some people think that after becoming employed, they will immediately lose their connection with academic studies, then the experiences of Mr. Bi Yuncheng and Mr. Hu Zhongchi are very suitable defenders. Therefore, "My Research Interests and Journalistic Career" is worth reading carefully for middle school students who are hesitating on the crossroads of "further education" and "employment."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Naiqi's "My Research Motivation and Research Experience" gave some powerful inspiration to young people who do not understand the true meaning of life: "Young people should not live for the sake of living, nor should they research for the sake of researching, let alone not want to research because they are dissatisfied with life. For the benefit of the masses, for the mission of history, we must research." This can further strengthen our will.</p>
<p>Speaking of the lack of emphasis on physical education, it has almost become a common malady in secondary schools. After reading Mr. Jin Zhonghua's article "I Once Wanted to Be a Physical Educationist," those "refined" middle school students who study to death for grades can arouse a fervent love for sports. I deeply hope so.</p>
<p>Just like this, after a cursory review, it can be said that the content of the "Research and Experience" special issue of The Chinese Middle School Student magazine is satisfactory enough. However, after reading it, I always feel like it's not full enough. It seems that the editorial postscript also said: "Several experts had already promised us to write articles. But they were really too busy, and they hadn't started writing by the time this issue went to print." Of course, I also want to agree with the editors: "I hope they will write more articles and submit them in the future" to fill our stomachs that are still not quite satisfied!</p>
<p>In short, after reading these articles, one can get all kinds of inspiration in learning and cultivation, which no one can deny.</p>

<h3>Starting from "Literature Has No Fixed Rules"</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianxiu</p>
<p>Sometimes when we discuss essay writing techniques, we feel the problem is too intricate and complex to discuss everything at once, and we often conclude with a seemingly resigned statement: "Literature has no fixed rules." In reality, this statement is somewhat oversimplified and not entirely accurate. It is true that the complexity, depth, and difficulty of Chinese make it challenging to master in a short period. However, to say that it has no set principles to follow would be unfair.</p>
<p>Two elements constitute a literary work: what are generally called "form" and "content." Style, structure, wording, sentence construction, rhetoric, and overall tone belong to the formal aspect of an essay; the events and principles recorded, and the emotions and thoughts expressed, are the content of the essay.</p>
<p>I believe that the content aspect of an essay is always heavily influenced by the author's subjectivity. A hundred people writing on the same topic will produce a hundred different contents. This is because people's thoughts and emotions often generate all sorts of unique shapes due to different objective environments (such as age, gender, occupation, economic status, academic experience, etc.). Since the shapes of individual thoughts and emotions have their own characteristics, their views on the same subject are naturally different, resulting in completely different essays. Therefore, in terms of the content of an essay, extracting certain "scientific" rules is inherently difficult, and in fact, there is no need to do so. However, in terms of the form of an essay, there are indeed many objective and concrete principles that exist, and we cannot dismiss them with the statement "literature has no fixed rules." For example, there are rules for wording, sentence construction, and rhetorical structure. Other aspects, such as style, also have clear external forms, categories, qualities, and modes of expression. All of these can be analyzed, dissected, and clearly explained using scientific methods. Therefore, I believe that while the content of an essay has no fixed rules due to individual subjectivity, its external form can certainly be guided by principles.</p>
<p>"Form" is an important aspect of an essay, because without "form," there is no way to express "content." Therefore, a beginner should focus on exploring and practicing the formal aspects of essay writing to rationalize their writing skills. Of course, enriching the content of the essay is also very important, but this is by no means something that can be accomplished quickly. It requires seeking and cultivating avenues for nourishment from various aspects such as academic knowledge, experience, and sentiment, allowing it to gradually progress and flourish, and the content of the essay will naturally become enriched.</p>
<p>Textbooks for the Chinese language that focus on the formal aspects of essay writing and are edited using scientific methods have not been commonly found. Recently, I saw two volumes of "One Hundred and Eight Lessons in National Language" published by Kaiming (the entire set has six volumes) and felt very satisfied. This is a Chinese language textbook for junior high school students to use in class or for self-study; it can also serve as a textbook for teachers. Its special feature lies in dispelling the general notion that Chinese language is mysterious and vague; it enables learners, in addition to understanding the content, to pay special attention to recognizing the external form of essays and acquiring proper methods for reading and writing.</p>
<p>This set of books adopts a mixed curriculum system divided into lessons. While it also incorporates a large selection of texts, it is not like ordinary textbooks that simply arrange articles mechanically with scattered annotations. Each lesson becomes a learning unit, including a "Discussion of Writing," two "Selected Readings," a section on "Grammar" or "Rhetoric," and several "Exercises." The "Discussion of Writing" at the beginning of each lesson discusses general principles of writing. Next are the "Selected Readings," the selection of which is centered on the "Discussion of Writing" and can be said to be examples or proofs of the "Discussion of Writing." Following that is the "Grammar" or "Rhetoric" section, each arranged in a logical and systematic manner, distributed throughout the lessons, with examples taken entirely from the "Selected Readings." The "Exercises" at the end of each lesson pose questions based on the content of the discussion of writing, grammar, and rhetoric, giving learners an opportunity to review.</p>
<p>For students below junior high school level, the "fun" aspect of the teaching material's format is a very important element. This "One Hundred and Eight Lessons in National Language" is able to integrate writing theory with selected texts. The writing style of Mr. Xia Gaizun and Mr. Ye Shaojun is very clear, beautiful, and fluent, written in an engaging manner. I believe that on the part of the learners, it will surely increase a lot of interest. Compared to blindly reading lectures and selected texts, groping around aimlessly, or diligently sticking to several grammar and rhetoric books, it is truly much better.</p>
<p>If a primary school graduate who is unable to continue their education, or a working person whose Chinese language proficiency is too low, consciously needs someone to be their Chinese language tutor, or wants to use their spare time to put in some self-study effort in the Chinese language subject, I think this "One Hundred and Eight Lessons in National Language" is quite capable of taking on this responsibility and helping them realize their long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>"One Hundred and Eight Lessons in National Language" is a very refined and scientific Chinese textbook, worthy of recommending to everyone. However, I don't know why only two volumes have been published so far; I sincerely hope that the remaining four volumes will be published quickly so that they can be seen by the world.</p>

<h3>"Fairy Tales and Child Study"</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>"In Japanese elementary schools, teachers, when dealing with literary teaching materials, do not perfectly develop their inherent value but often adopt the same methods as teaching science and history, imparting them to children. Rather than saying that teachers want children to enjoy the true taste of literature, it would be better to say that they want to use literary materials to indiscriminately instill scientific and historical knowledge into children..."</p>
<p>Reading the above passage, one cannot help but feel that Chinese children are also experiencing the same thing. Especially in this era against fairy tales, children's books generally focus on scientific common sense, instilling into children materials that we consider "beneficial" from an adult's subjective standpoint. As for stories and fairy tales, they are generally rejected. In the eyes of authors of children's books, stories and fairy tales are merely things for entertainment, without any real educational value. However, let us see how Takeo Matsumura explains their Japanese education, which may also be used to explain our Chinese children's education phenomenon and the results that this phenomenon will lead to.</p>
<p>"Our so-called education is more in the sense of cultivation rather than education. Today's so-called education is characterized by A appealing to intellectual power, B lacking organic unity, and C lacking fun. Therefore, although children know many facts, they do not completely become the food of their hearts, and various knowledge is not used to cultivate their minds in a complete unity. As a result, children are only burdened by the weight of knowledge and do not have the mental space to enjoy it with a pleasant mood."</p>
<p>Burdened by the weight of knowledge, unable to obtain proper cultivation of their minds, what can we do to prevent children from eagerly leaning towards comic strips? Children love fantasy, novelty, pursuit, and exploration, but the "beneficial" reading materials specially made for them by adults cannot satisfy their desires. They lack practical experience, so the realistic background is very thin in both life and thought. Whether it's a tree or a table, they can suddenly become personified and active. If scientific truths can follow the development of children's minds, guiding them to the charm in an interesting and vivid way! The effect will be greater than only appealing to children's intellectual power and memory, and emotional arousal is more profound than any method. Children's medicine needs a sugar coating, and children's knowledge also needs a sugar coating. How to wrap the sugar coating outside the knowledge? The book "Fairy Tales and Child Study" may be able to give child educators some help. Regarding the writing attitude, the author of the above book said this passage, and now I will cite it here as the ending:</p>
<p>"Those who create fairy tales must have a pure love for children. A wholehearted love for children is precisely a great magic that gives the fairy tales they create a lively life. If there is no such pure love, then no matter how well the fairy tale author knows all the skills in literature and art, no matter how well the fairy tale author understands the psychology of children scientifically, the work is also something without life, a kind of skeleton lacking active flesh and blood."</p>

<h3>Germany is About to Demand the Return of its Colonies Again</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Not long ago, it was reported that Hitler intended to hold a referendum in April, putting two questions to a vote: Does Germany need colonies? Should Germany restore armed forces in the Rhineland? Unexpectedly, before these two questions were raised, the second question had already been answered. The Rhineland area, where no troops had been stationed for many years, is now under the rule of German troops under the 卐 banner. Now, Germany is about to take action to realize the first question.</p>
<p>Recently, a dispatch from Paris stated that reliable sources revealed that Germany is now proposing a plan to European countries, asking them to lend money to Germany so that Germany can buy back Upper Silesia, Memel, and the Polish Corridor, or Germany's pre-war colonies in Africa. Borrowing money from various countries to buy back colonies, Mr. Xi's move is much more peaceful than sending a large army into the Rhineland area. It is said that this proposal is also accompanied by an explanation, saying that if this can be established, it can eliminate Germany's future actions of resorting to force. In fact, Germany's demand for its former colonies has become very urgent. If this matter cannot be resolved through other means, it is inevitable that it will be fought for by force.</p>
<p>However, although the method of buying back colonies with money is good, its implementation may not be easy. This is because colonies are not purely an economic issue, but also closely related to political issues. Therefore, this proposal by Germany may be difficult to obtain the consent of various countries. At the very least, countries with conflicting interests will express opposition.</p>
<p>Even if Germany truly wants to do this, it is still questionable. Like the colonies listed above, they originally belonged to Germany. Now Germany has to pay a price to recover these colonies, and this loss will be significant. Therefore, this proposal by Germany may just be a prelude to recovering its colonies one day.</p>
<p>According to another piece of news, Mr. Xi advocates reallocating the former German African territories, and at the same time, he also advocates having a sphere of influence in Abyssinia. It seems that Germany not only hopes to demand the return of its old colonies at this moment but also intends to demand new colonies. Mr. Xi once said that European countries have the right to colonize overseas, and Germany is now very strong, needing no assistance from the League of Nations, and needing no treaties, colonies are obtained by power. In that case, the first question that Mr. Xi wants to propose for a referendum may soon have an answer.</p>
<h3>The Blind Man</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Our home is next door to the house of that blind man surnamed Cui. It is a dilapidated courtyard, the paint on the gate has all peeled off. Only the black and gold sign hanging beside the door still gloriously displays the owner's identity, a kind of nostalgic brilliance.</p>
<p>Before, I walked past it like everyone else, never paying attention to it. Later, my younger brother, who had developed a close friendship with the neighborhood, heard some stories about local customs from others, among which were stories about this blind man surnamed Cui.</p>
<p>It is said that the blind man Cui is very famous. In the eyes of the local gentry, he is simply as divine as Zhuge Liang. They not only ask him about ordinary things, but also seek his advice on many problems in their lives. For example, how this year's business will be, which side is good to work on, as long as the blind man Cui says a word, their poor fate is decided. I remember when I first arrived in the area and was staying in a hotel, looking for a relative but unable to find the address, the waiter had diligently said, "Why don't you find the blind man Cui to calculate it for you!" I didn't understand why he specifically recommended this person surnamed Cui. When I asked him, he told me:</p>
<p>"Sir, you don't know the blind man Cui? That's really strange, ah, he's famous... You are from another province, sir... He, let me tell you: when Zhang 'Long Legs' was here, he was capable... At that time, I don't know what army came, but anyway, they came to fight Zhang 'Long Legs'. They fought all the way to the foot of Qianfo Mountain. Zhang 'Long Legs' was about to order a retreat. Who knew that at this time, someone introduced a blind man. He advised: —Governor, ah, at that time there was no chairman, it was still called a Governor... He said: Governor, don't panic, quickly order a counterattack; you will definitely win, and the Governor can still sit for another year... Wow, this one word was crucial; it touched Zhang 'Long Legs'' cautious heart, so he ordered a counterattack, and suddenly the blind man's words came true. Zhang 'Long Legs' was so happy that he just laughed and hurriedly invited the blind man into the Governor's Office, treating him as a military advisor... That blind man is the blind man Cui. He is very capable, and he still accepts many disciples, teaching them the methods of divination... You, sir, should have him calculate for you..."</p>
<p>I found this story very interesting. Although I refused his request, I planned to find this blind man and talk to him. This is because I had heard people say that a blind man is so accustomed to meditating all day long that he becomes a philosopher. Later, I became busy with my own affairs and forgot about this matter. I really didn't expect to live next door to him. When I walked past that door again the next day, I paid special attention. However, besides the sign indicating his origin and name, nothing else could be shown, let alone that its owner was the once rich and powerful blind man Cui.</p>
<p>The next day, I asked my younger brother if he had seen him and what he looked like. He told me that I could go to find him at any time. One afternoon, I went to his house with my younger brother. At that time, my mood was really like a lover without any experience visiting his beloved.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the gate, we saw a person who appeared to be in his forties, with short hair that had already turned white, and a short beard that was also old. He was leisurely strolling, wearing a silk and cotton lined robe. The sunlight shone on his blind eyeballs, appearing as shameless as boasting about wealth to someone who had no food to eat. He did not feel the sunlight, but his ears keenly heard our footsteps. He said in an elderly person's low voice:</p>
<p>"Who is it? Please come in and sit..." His gentle attitude was like a stone Buddha. "Who are you?"</p>
<p>My younger brother was probably familiar with him. As soon as he answered him, he warmly "yo-yoed" as if he had met an old friend, reaching out to find my younger brother's hand. My younger brother then introduced me to him. When he shook my hand, he exclaimed, "Good fortune, good fortune, to have such good brothers!"</p>
<p>He walked into the house with his arm around my younger brother's shoulder, and I followed in. The furnishings in the house were like that of a well-off family, or rather, a high-class family, with many precious porcelain items and beautiful wooden objects, which a small well-off family would not be able to afford. Zhang "Long Legs"'s photo hung on the wall, with inscriptions praising the identity of the house's owner. Its owner, with a full face, explained to us:</p>
<p>"These things were all left behind by Governor Zhang!"</p>
<p>When we walked out, four or five blind men walked in together. I heard that they were all his disciples. My younger brother told me; "He is living a peaceful life, and many dignitaries often use cars to pick him up for divination, making hundreds of dollars at a time! His disciples also have great influence in society!"</p>
<p>Sometimes when I walk past his door and see his black and gold sign, I am reminded that I have a chance to ask him "How much longer does this sign's fate last?..."</p>
<h3>Songs on the River of Green Leaves</h3>
<p>— Miyama</p>
<p>Winter has passed in the blink of an eye. Spring comes with it.</p>
<p>Spring is not a big deal for us. Because there is no way to tell in our lives, whether it is spring or summer, we all live in pain. In the old days, there were songs of joy everywhere, and when the people on this boat sang, the people on countless boats would join in. Our songs are all in memory of our dead ancestors, and each song tells a story of an ancestor's life. This life is a valuable experience: we treat it as homework to learn. ...Now that our lives have become hard, those songs seem to have changed with it: it's a little dull.</p>
<p>This spring, we hope to be as happy as we used to be.</p>
<p>Looking at the turbulent river, I thought of an ancestor.</p>
