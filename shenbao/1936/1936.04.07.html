<p>時評</p>
<h3>奧國恢復徵兵制的前瞻</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>奧國在大戰以後因受聖哲爾曼和的的束縛取消了微兵制度限制着軍隊不得超過三萬人到最近因受德國重整軍備的刺戟便打算擺脫這種束縛擴充軍備了本月一日奧國議會决議恢復徵兵制度凡年在十八歲和四十二歲之間而身體健全的男子都得服工役或兵役爲的是使奧國現有的軍隊由三萬人增加到十五萬人這個决議表面上雖不過是德國所倡導的『旣成事實』的延續但歐洲局勢因此所受的影饗却很値得我們的注意</p>
<p>第一奧國徵兵是和德意爭霸中歐問題有關的德國要解除國內的經濟危機鞏固「納粹」的政權不得不力求向外發展而樹立中歐霸權攫取多瑙河流域的經濟利益從而伸張它的勢力於南歐就是德國向外發展的計畫之一在這計畫中併吞奧國當然是重要的一步而且實際上德奧合併成爲第三帝實的實施政綱之一了可是首創法西斯蒂的意大利也覬覦着多瑙河流域的經濟利益墨索里尼以爲倘能攫得這方面的利益就足以解除意國經濟危機的一部份而且奧國扼着多瑙河的上游又是巴爾幹的門戶意國倘要鞏固勃倫納山隘的邊旁尤其不得不先在奧國建樹一個森嚴的壁壘所以意國時刻嚴防着德國的南侵不惜以全力資助奧國使它成爲自己的附庸德國此决廢棄羅卡諾公的進兵萊茵氣燄高張意國深恐德國以迅雷不及掩耳的手段併吞奧國便在羅馬召集意奧匈三國會議討論怎樣增强三國集團的軍事實力以對付德國的對奧政策此次奧國會决議恢復徵兵制度恰好在三國會議以後雖然奧外長聲明着這和三國會議無關但是就今日中歐的形勢看來我們却不得不疑到奧國這種舉動至少有幾分是意國所策動的</p>
<p>第二國恢復徵兵制度已經引起了小協約國的反對但小協的國的態度到今爲止似乎還看不出怎樣的堅决來這是因爲法國對於奧國徵兵勢將加以默認的緣故法國以爲奧國這種舉動無異在多瑙河對岸築成一道堤防阻止德國向中歐的發展雖然這在另一方面也可加强奧國對小協的國的壓迫增長意國在中歐的勢力而影響到法國在中歐的現有勢力和在奧國的投資市塲但是在法國欲挾意以制德的前提下自然也惟有加以默認罷了至於英國雖以奧國此舉不免增强意國在地中海的聲勢但是它對中歐問題向不積極干涉而且實際上中歐非它的勢力所及當然暫取旁觀的態度國際的形勢如此可知奧國恢復徵兵制度是不至於遇到多大的阻難的</p>
<p>現在匈牙利隨奧國之後也表示要求擴充軍備的平等權利了奧匈同時重整軍備在一方面足使兩國失地所形成的小協約國感到更深的威脅在另一方面也足使德意的矛盾更加尖銳化『山雨欲來風滿樓』正是今日中歐的形勢了</p>

<h3>宋子文　昨接見新聞界</h3>
<p>談全經委會本年度工作　我國穩固外匯已吿成功　中行存欽增至七萬萬餘</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會常委兼中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、六日上午十一時、在中國銀行接見新聞記者、發表下列之談話、</p>
<p>全經委會　本年工作</p>
<p>據宋氏談、全國經濟委員會將於本月月底或下月初、在京召開常會、報吿本年度之工作槪况、並决定下年度之工作計劃、西北之交通網、業於本年度完成、由四川至陝西及甘肅各公路、均已先後通車、本年度之衛生工作、則側重於雲南、最近閩省陳主席亦曾來函要求派員前往恊助進行一切、至於水利工作、則歸全國水利委員會辦理、由孔財長主持之、本年度之主要工作、卽爲堵塞黃河决口、</p>
<p>我國採取　外匯本位</p>
<p>關於我國之幣制、事實上目前業經放棄銀本位、而實行外匯本位、現在穩固外匯、已吿成功、十一月四日之外匯情形、迄今仍猶維持、美金先令及日金、目前無多變動、是故我國之外匯、並未特殊傾向美金先令或日金、至於將來如有重大之變更、當再行决定我國之傾向、</p>
<p>中國銀行　存欵激增</p>
<p>中國銀行原屬官辦、嗣以增加巨額商股、成爲商業銀行、去歲政府增加官股、一般人懷疑此後中行之存欵將形减少、但事實上中行於增加官股之後、存欵反激增、去歲存欵共計七萬萬六千六百餘萬元、較前年增加二萬萬一千九百餘萬元、實爲中行存欵之最高紀錄、於此可見人民對於中國銀行之信仰、實可表示人民對於政府之信仰、與過去實已大不相同、同時政府之責任亦覺加重、政府與商業打成一片之後、政府之力量固大、而責任亦重、又去歲中行之存欵中、有各商界銀行之存欵、約計九千餘萬元、蓋以去歲百業凋敝、各行均不敢放欵也、</p>
<p>三行紙幣　發行增多</p>
<p>中央中國交通三行之紙幣、發行續有增加、前者三行發行之紙幣、的計七萬萬元、現已增加一二萬萬、其原因有三、商業銀行之紙幣發行减少、此其一、人民以現銀掉換法幣、此其二、外商各銀行、除日本銀行外、均以現銀掉換法幣、此其三、惟紙幣之發行雖增、而以準備充足、故人民之信仰甚好、將來當以需要而逐漸增多、關於民間現銀之儲藏、目前尙無統計、河北省之現銀、多數均已外流、而山東及河南兩省民間之儲藏仍多、至於財部前以白銀五千萬盎斯換金存於美國、係作外匯之用、蓋黃金隨時可以撥動、購買任何外匯、方便殊多、</p>
<p>中行籌設　海外分行</p>
<p>各商業銀行擬實行聯立制度、本人僅聞此說而未知其詳、據本人觀察各商業銀行、如實行聯立、則力量增加、當較分立爲好、惟聯立之方式甚多、如聯合準備、亦其一也、至於中央中國交通三行、則仍分立、中央改爲準備銀行、目前仍積極籌備之中、何日成立、尙無所聞、中國銀行除在倫敦原有分行外、現正籌設紐的星加坡舊金山爪哇及安南各地分行、以便匯兌、本人前擬赴各地視察分行、旋以改革幣制、不克啟行、」茲因公務稍閒、天氣日暖、决於短期間內啟行赴各地視察云、</p>
<p>政府目前　未借外債</p>
<p>外傳　鐵道部擬向銀行界借欵二萬萬五千萬之說、鐵長張公權氏在滬、並無接洽、　我國擬向英借欵未成此次上海銀行總經理陳光甫氏渡美、又啣命向美接洽借欵之說、本人並無所聞、我國雖曾擬向外國借欵、以發展國內建設、但現在並未進行、　美國棉麥借欵、前雖係本人經手、惟本人自卸任財長後、卽未加過問、償淸與否、難置答、時有人詢宋氏對於日本所倡「工業日本農業中國」之意見、宋氏笑而不答、囑可詢諸中日貿易協會、宋氏繼談、有人主張銀行减低利息、以救濟工商、應先由中央中國交通三國家銀行减低共放予商業銀行欵項之利息者、此說當有可能、但須視財政部意旨而定、</p>

<h3>昨日浦江內　日輪撞壞華船</h3>
<p>唐山丸撞壞時和　損害稈度甚重大</p>
<p>本埠公濟輸船公司之時和號輸、昨在浦江內被日淸公司之唐山丸輸猛撞、時和船體被撞、損失至巨、本報記者得訊後、特赴各方面調查、茲將此事詳情分述如後、</p>
<p>時和將開船</p>
<p>公濟輪船公司之時和號輪、載重一五一三噸、註冊凈噸爲九一八噸又二七、船身長一百五十七英尺八寸、闊二十四英尺三寸、深十五英尺二寸、吃水十七尺六寸、有兩層甲板、機器爲三聯式、馬力六百四、每小時行八海里半、係一九〇三年造自德國、該輸此次裝煤來滬、泊浦江二十八號與二十九號河筒、卸去裝煤、昨日上午十時許、已準備開船矣、乃時和輸正欲離河筒出口往海州、詎被當時進口之日輪唐山丸猛撞、受重大損害、</p>
<p>碰撞時情形</p>
<p>日淸公司之唐山丸輸、現改航南華至上海、兼駛北洋綫、該輸載量二千零八十九噸、此决由廣東等埠、裝載大批貨件與旅客、開回上海、於昨日上午十時許、駛近電燈廠浦江江面、經過二十八九號河筒之際、正值時和輸掉頭離浮標、而欲開航、時忽有一帆船、從江面開來、唐山丸恐撞帆船、船首稍讓、詎潮水壓力甚巨、唐山丸之船頭、帆船固已避過、而乘勢乃向時和輸之後船尾撞來、砰然一聲、遂肇巨禍、</p>
<p>損傷極重大</p>
<p>彼時時和輸被撞之際、尙未離開河筒、船主見唐山丸輪之船頭橫駛而來、因本船拋靠在河筒邊、無從避讓、祇得立懸黑旗、表示請對方之輸、火速停車止進、吾則將發生巨大危險、然已不及、唐山丸之船頭已將時和輸之後尾左側猛撞矣、時和後尾、立時洞破、鋼板毀裂至西塊之多、破洞的方一丈、船尾艙面上之建築物、與欄杆等項、亦皆震毀、損失極重、</p>
<p>雙方共勘騐</p>
<p>出事後、唐山丸卽開回碼頭、起卸貨客、時和船長立卽飛報滬上代理該輪業務之義與行、先經該行派員到輸騐看傷壞狀况、一面命船主補助報吿、分呈航政局與保險公司、請派騐船師到輸勘騐、當時又命時和輸中止出口、留滬大修、午後保險行騐船師、已至時和與唐山丸兩船檢騐、聞唐山丸之損傷至微、其撞碰之責任問題、目前尙難討諭云、</p>

<h3>絲綢業廠商　籌設人造絲廠</h3>
<p>資本一千萬元官商各半　該廠擬設在浙江之杭州</p>
<p>申時社訊、吾國絲業、本極發達、年來受世界不景氣潮流之激盪、及人造絲之競爭、景况一落千丈、查人造絲一項、爲製綢重要原料、純係來自國外、吾國尙無專廠製造、本市綢業廠商、有鑒於此、特擬具計劃、呈請中央、籌設一人造絲廠、現正在積極進行籌備中、探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>本市綢商、因鑒於人造絲一項、每年漏巵甚大、因此擬具計劃、由代表王延松携京、呈請行政實業兩部、籌欵設置全國人造絲廠、聞財政部孔部長對於此項計劃、頗爲贊成、允予協助、王氏在京接洽圓滿、回滬後卽着手進行籌備、募集股欵、聞已募有成數云、</p>

<h3>日商在華北設紗廠　華紗益瀕危殆</h3>
<p>天津日設紗廠定十五日開工　紗布交易所成交者什九日紗</p>
<p>日商紗業在我國已獲有特殊發展之地位、最近復受政府維持實業政策之保護、在天津又設立大規模紗廠、與滬靑漢等各廠取得聯絡、奄奄一息之華紗市塲、將益瀕危殆、記者以事關我國整個紗業、特向各關係方面探詢經過、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>華北日紗　廠將開丁</p>
<p>天津華商紗廠、計有裕元·恒元·北洋·寶成·裕大·華新·等六家、年來因紗業不振、經濟週轉困難、先後被日商收買以去者、計裕大·裕元·兩家、查日商除在上海·靑島·漢口·三處設有紗廠外、而天津方面則並無設立、最近日方爲謀在華紗業作更進一步擴展、操縱我國內市塲起見、由東洋紗廠大阪紡織社·鐘紡織社·合資在天津東局設立新廠、已定十五日開工、其第一步計劃、配裝紗錠五萬錠、第二步計劃、預定明年內完成紗錠增加至十萬錠、將來此項計劃實現、不僅在天津原有華商紗廠受其控制、我國整個紗業、亦將成覆巢之卵、而無一堪與四敵也、</p>
<p>中日紗錠　數量比較</p>
<p>中日紗廠之紗錠比較、全國華商紗廠、現有紗錠約計二百七十萬弱、因華廠原料成本及利息並資本上流動困難、現已减少十分之三·五（卽停開三成半）、目前情况、雖見轉機、但仍外强中乾、日商紗廠計上海·靑島·漢口·三處、紗錠約計二百四十五萬錠、因其出品之改進、成本利息之低、銷路暢</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>世界上任何一切的事物，是都在一息不停地變動着。</p>
<p>「水不流動，就要污濁」，同樣一切事業的發展和進行，假使我們不常在留心改進，改良，努力使它日新又新，牠到後來，是凖會落伍，而失敗的。</p>
<p>「前進」，這是我們在這動盪不安的時代，每個人應有的表徵，因爲「不進則退」，我們應該時時刻刻惟恐落後，於劇烈的生存競存中，被遺棄而滅亡。</p>
<p>不過，許多人往往以爲社會上一切事物的改良，是整個的，突然的，而他們不懂得大處着眼，小處下手的道理，其實，我們是只有從小處着手，逐漸地設法改良和演進，纔能得到最後的成功的。</p>
<p>從「漸變」纔有「突變」，這是哲學上吿訴給我們的話。</p>
<h3>都市中的遊牧生活</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>在我們這個東方巴黎的大都市裹，上中下三等人，過的都有些兒像是逐水草而居者的遊牧生活。</p>
<p>先說上等人。上等人，雖然家裹住的是前有花園，後有草地的大洋房，但眞是天曉得的，十天之中，不知可有一二天，是住在這大洋房中過夜的。通常是今天在甚麼飯店過夜，明天又上別個甚麼飯店中宿着，後天晚上，自然又換了別一個飯店了。就是不住飯店，住的所在，也正多着呢。二姨太太，三姨太太的小公館裏，也儘可存身。若這些所在，也嫌膩煩了，那麼，索性上窰子去，宿上一　二晚，也無不可。若是在星期六晚上，那更可跳一整夜舞，或是賭一整夜牌，更不用煩惱着這一晚的歸宿問題了。</p>
<p>中等人，雖沒有上等人那麼絕對的居處無定，但最低的限度，總也得依着時季，而變換居處。例如在冬天，住在屋子裏，到了夏天，便得躺在籐椅中，在晒台上，或在弄中過宿，以避屋子中熱浪與臭虫的侵襲。有的，索性挾着一床草席，到街旁的人行道上，去尋求好夢。待到天凉之後，才再回進屋子去。而在這一個階級中的人，在月初支薪時，有時也會得在旅館中，住上一二晚，賭錢玩女人，而暫時放棄着固定的家庭生活的。</p>
<p>至於下等人，那倒又是絕對的居處無定。暑天，躺着小菜傷，寒天，躺在弄堂口。此外，如混堂，粥店，老虎灶，燕子窠等等，都是避寒度夜的好去處。若是囊棄裕如時，那麼，花上十幾個子兒，也居然可在小客棧中，佔得高舖一席地。此輩，大半都是吹簫「滬市」，乞食四方的，今天楊樹浦，明天曹家渡，後天又混到了高昌廟，行踪無定，隨遇而安，十足地過的是遊牧生活。</p>
<p>本來，在上海混，任誰是想混一點生活，在實際上，也正和遊牧民族的逐水草而居的目的，沒甚分別呀。</p>
<h3>吳子城遺址</h3>
<p>— 凡非</p>
<p>校課完畢之後，到吳苑去喝茶，碰到三年多不見的老同學蔣大沂君，沒有幾句寒暄，他就打開一個紙包，指着包內的獸骨，牛角，陶片，壓成炭質的木片道：「這些束西的年齡，同至聖先師差不多了。」接着道：「這些東西，發現在王廢基。」我詢間他得到這些東西的前因後果，他作以下的談話：蔣君根據了王廢基的歷史，推到元末張士誠的王宮，戰國時的吳王室，吳子城，都在這區域裹，於是從事考察。一天，行徑公園後面，金城銀行正在大興士木，在挖起的泥土中，發見了明淸的磁片，在一個新開的五公呎光景深的水坑旁邊，堆積着這坑中挖起的淤泥，在這淤泥裹，發見獸骨牛角（古代的民食有關係）和幾何紋古陶片及黑色素陶片。得到這些對於文化上佔重要性的東西以後，加以研究，瞪明是戰國時代的遺物，吳子城的遺址，也隨之確證了。但是限於採掘古物規則，不能立卽發掘，明瞭地下情况。等到當局的學術機關和諸邦人士，有了計劃，層層的發掘下去，當有一番驚人的成績。</p>
<h3>能禦此暴風雨　？</h3>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>楔子　賞菊近重陽尋幽小集　聯珠溫舊夢飮恨千秋</p>
<p>大白分開了一業長葉子，找了好久，在裏面摘了一小莖花，交給我。我看那化，長長的花柄，頗有點像小的洋海棠，瓣子是紫色的，花旁像一個小香囊，很是玲瓏，凑到鼻子上聞，有一種比蘭花較濃的香味。我凝神了一會，把花挿在襟上忽然兩手一拍道：這我就明白了，這是歐西的一種名花，呌做紫羅蘭，其間曾有一段哀艷的神話的。大白說：你看這裹裹外外那裏不是紫羅蘭，所以這小園子也就成了幽蘭小築了。當四五月的時候，這花盛開，香聞滿巷，蘭兄是最得意的了。我說：蘭兄一生，最愛紫羅蘭，無諭什麼事情，總會把這話牽引上去。可說與花有綠，愛花若命了。我們正這樣談着，蘭厂走過來了，他笑着說：我是請你來賞菊的，不是請你來賞紫羅蘭的，走罷，我們看菊花去。他很高興的引了我們向園子裹去。這園子雖小，土山魚池却也樣樣都有。四下裏羅維列了幾百盆大小菊花，或靠了短籬，或半藏着山石，或由大樹幹下欹斜着出來，或放在竹陰的落葉堆上，隨了花的肥瘦濃淡，都含有畫家的章法。那些來賓，有的在花圃草地上閑談，有的站在竹林下，有的隨着鵝卯石的曲徑走，各適所適。只忙壞了主人翁，四處忙碌着招待客人。但是我的目的，不是來看菊的，邀了蘭厂，就到土山上的一座活樹亭子裹坐下。這裹是用活樹支着的一所六角小亭子，裹面有一張石桌，四張木凳，正對了菊花，有那樹幹支的屈曲闌干，很可以小坐。這時，恰是天上淡淡的抹了幾片白羅似的輕雲，園子裹新得了一片輕陰，很是有此淸趣。接着樹梢搖動，瑟瑟有聲，却飄下幾點雨來。我說：這幾片雲和幾點雨，來得很有點詩意，眞個是細雨菊花天了。對了這種好景，我們不能不談一點賞心樂事。蘭兄所說的小說村料，可以宜佈了嗎？蘭厂笑說：那位仁兄還沒有到。我愕然了，問說：那一位仁兄？蘭厂笑說：我說小說材料藏在我家裏，那是冤你的，不過騙你到我家來吃一頓飯。至於供給材料的，是一位阮先生。他和這件事，頗有點關係。原來他是託我編小說的，我一打聽故事的地點，是南京九江北平，對於道三處地點，我沒有法子描寫，我就轉薦了你。這也是我一番好意，以爲小說中間，把地方性寫得切實些，那就更好了。我聽到阮先生，我就聯想到一個大鬍子的人。（五）</p>
<h3>三人行</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>在歸途上，恰遇着三個人，是和我同道行的。彼此一路行來，在他們的形容上，言談中，使我知道這三個人正是有着三種不同的型。</p>
<p>第一個年紀是在三十餘歲，也許三十還不到吧？因爲他滿面的烟容，枯瘦的肌膚，實在太顯得蒼老了。據他吿訴其餘兩人的話，他不但吸鴉片，而且還吸紅丸。眞的看上去他烟癮已在發作了，脚步是顯得這樣的沉重弛懈。</p>
<p>第二個身體倒還强壯，只是兩眼發紅在吿訴着欠缺睡眠。他一路很高興地講着牌經。據說此去，就是應的賭博。</p>
<p>第三個是在中途上加入的，他是從一家小酒店內出來，樣子很酩酊，一股難受的酒氣，常常給風吹入我鼻管。這樣，走過幾條街，他遇到他一個朋友，他又拉這朋友到就近的一家酒店去，說：我來會鈔。</p>
<p>我到了家，暗暗地想：孔老夫子說：『三人行必有我師，』我今天正遇到三人行，但敎我師那一個呢？吸烟，賭博，喝酒，都不是孔聖所允許的吧！繼而一想：對了，這三個人，實際上都是我的良師。</p>
<p>吸烟的有恒不輟，寢饋其中，我在學業上不當效法嗎？賭博的勇往直前再接再厲，我在事業上不當效法嗎？喝酒的一醉解愁，慷慨好友我在處世上也不當效法嗎？這三個人實在都是我的良師。</p>
<h3>財主的等級</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>甲乙二人同雄於資，各居一鄉，儼然有士財主之稱。一天，甲因事訪乙，適乙不在。乙的老婆知道了，因想：久聞甲亦係財主，到不如把他估量一下，由我出去招待罷。</p>
<p>彼此相見，自不免先寒暄一番。接著，甲說明來意，於是那位財主奶奶卽向甲渾身看個飽，倒把甲弄得有些忸怩起來了。那知伊突開口說道：「相你，頭等財主還够不上，恐怕是二等罷！」</p>
<p>甲初有些愕然，因定一定神，反問道：「請敎：頭等財主和二等財主有何區別啊？」</p>
<p>伊的答話是這樣：「頭等財主有七房，二等有五房，三等有三房：這就是定財主等級的標準。」</p>
<p>甲越聽越不明白了，因問：『此「房」怎講？』</p>
<p>伊乃不慌不忙地答說道：「我吿訴你，財主共分三等。三等的不過是起碼財主。所謂三房，就是：內房，客房，廚房是。二等的呢，客來不必親自開門，有門房代勞；收租不必親自出馬，有帳房代理。合之內房，客房，廚房，不是五房嗎？頭等的呢，除五房之外，還有馬房，偏房！」</p>
<p>甲默然有頃，始說道：「說也慚愧，我只好屈居二等財主了！」原來甲來訪乙時，乙的老婆探得他是坐轎來的，所以這樣說。這，一方面彷彿有些嘲笑甲的意思，而另一方面則無非表示乙比他還高一等！</p>
<p>看官們，你們自已可估量一下，屬於那一等！</p>
<p>新發明</p>
<h3>世界各國的發明</h3>
<p>— 景仁芳</p>
<p>無光砲　在歐洲大戰的時候，人們曾發明多種方法，來觀測敵陣中大砲的地點，這些方法總不外從兩個地點覜測敵砲的火光，而後立即求出該砲的眞正所在地點，於是用砲還擊，現在荷蘭有一位發明家，爲發砲時不使敵軍看到火光起見，在專利局註冊了一種方法：就是在放砲時，繞砲口噴着一股液體的烟霧，使熱氣不得和外界空氣接觸，這樣就成爲無光砲了。</p>
<p>工廠式的人體模型　紐約科學博物院，近來陳列一種人體模型，他的構造和工廠相彷彿，像呼吸消化，血液循環，和其他生命活動，多以極像眞方法表現出，例如用光錢表示炭氣和養氣的流通，又有磨輸一，代表人的臼齒，代表心臟的，是一種活塞，可以窺見血液的活動，更有趣的腦中分爲丸部，他的構造完全依人類腦中天然的排列：一，判斷力，以法庭代表，二，智慧力，以課堂代表，三，管腺力，以指導器代表，四，制筋力，以鐵道中之轉轍器代表，五，意志力，以執行委員會議代表，六，呼吸管理力，以測量器和度衡器代表，七，聽力以收音室代表，八，視力，以攝影師辦公室代表，九，神經中心，以電話之變電機關代表。</p>
<p>摩天大廈　美國某著名建築師，新近創議請由政府在一有名城市中心建築一所一百九十六層的摩天大廈做商場，高達二千呎以上，據說這座商場的建築費要二萬二千三百萬美金，內部設備足供一切商業的應用，可以容納二十五萬人居住，並可設大中小學，和醫院工廠等。另有幾層租與工業家作爲出品展覽的會場，構造材料用鋼骨和白色陶瓷爲大宗，形式注意藝衛化。</p>
<p>射熱電器消迷霧　紐約市地方，近來試騐一種射熱器，其力能掃除霧霾，這種光一經放射大霧裹，應用於飛機場，能使飛機得以安穩降落，功用很大，此器狀如探海燈，但無折光鏡，裝於車上，以便轉移，所放射的熱心，是由內耀的電弧光發出，中蓄特種電極，所用電流，同於普通的探險燈，光的射幅甚狹，所以力甚强，能使水分成爲蒸氣，故消减霧霾最易，在機場中放射時，光力先向地面掃射，利用塗有鐵箔之鏡板，返射於空際，雖在大霧之中，也可露出漏斗形的光明，未幾即可完全澄澈。</p>
<p>無骨架的金屬氣球　最近蘇聯製成一隻容積在一千立方米突全無骨架的金屬氣球，牠的外殼是用〇。一公分厚的鐵銹金屬製成，堅固耐用，因爲沒有堅硬骨架，所以構造可以簡單節省而且可用機器製造。飛行時最大的利益爲免除「氣體浪」，因其外殼能保護氣體，且能利用引擎中的廢氣，飛船的巨大彈力，使其可以接近地面演習，據發明者者名科學家齊爾科夫斯基氏計劃，使人能製造巨大飛船，成爲廉價安全的大衆運輸工具。</p>

<p>學校調查</p>
<h3>上海法國學校槪况　（四）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>此種嚴密訓練的利弊也可說明一下。第一點，法國敎育的主要宗旨是在盡量地培養學生埋智的發展；因此對於體育訓練和社會敎育則少有注意。但是這極訓練可使法國學校保持較高的學業標準，而是其地各國學校所不友的。第一點，法國兒童在中小學受過嚴密的訓練以覆，將來到大學享受個性的自由時，不免要濫用此種自由。所幸法國的兒童在中小學時已經獲得一種從事正常的和有效率的理智工作的習戳，這種習慣可以平衡濫用自由的傾向。第三點，法國的兒童在中小學時經過此種嚴密的訓練以後，將來到成人就可成為法蘭西民主國的十城。</p>
<p>在上海法國學校中，還有－種特殊的訓練，就是養成兒童有一種國際和諧的精神。該校雖有二十六國國籍的兒童，但是各國兒童日常相處卻沒有彼此仇視或輕蔑的態度。據高愽愛先生說，他長該校二十餘年，（筆者按：高氏原任該校校長，現因法公董局學校事業繁重，敢近另行成立敎育處，調升高氏為敎育處長平日時常向該校學生訓導，同學之間不歷有種族和國家的成見。選種國際精神的訓練，現在已經達到相當的成功，這是高氏所引以為自豪的。</p>
<p>五、思想他的自由</p>
<p>法國學校對於學生的行為雖然嚴密地監督，但是對於學生思想的自由卻是絕對地尊重。這種思想的自由非但法國的大學生可以享受，就是法國的中小學也是非常的注重。培養思想自由的方法分敎師和學生兩方面進行。在敎師方面，任何敎師不得在敎室中宜傳任何政黨上主義上或宗敎上的意見。學校中不得擁護某黨，排斥某派；勸信某種主義，攻擊他種主養；不宣傳宗敎，亦不反對宗敎。總之，學校中絕對尊重思想和信仰的自由。</p>
<p>在學生方面，學生可以自由發表他個人的思想和信仰。不過，他道種發表必須是合乎理性的和偏於硏究的，並非是盲目地擁護或排斥某黨派或主義的文章。敎師對於改正學生的課卷在文章方而當然可以盡量地改削，但是對於學生純理性和硏究性的思想與信仰則應盡量地保全，不得依據個人的好惡而增刪。</p>

<h3>安徽茶葉硏究（一）</h3>
<p>— 史紀法</p>
<p>（一）安徽產茶地區·種類·及其產額</p>
<p>安徽物產豐富，首推茶葉。因其土脈厚而焙製精良，故內推銷全國，外而輸出歐美南洋，莫不收譽以歸。雖然國內閩浙，湘，　，贛，鄂諸省亦多產茶，終莫可及。安徽為產茶最富之區，大江南北，幾無縣不產。江北所產者，統名曰「北茶。」江南所產者統名曰「南茶皖北六安霍山縣所產綠茶名震國內，皖南秋浦（至德）祁門所產之紅茶馳譽海外。所謂「徽六名茶」由來久矣。考其歷史淵源，綠茶始於魏晉，而盛行於唐宋。戲茶始於秋浦，當民國紀元前三十七年有黟人余某於秋浦縣堯渡街開設紅茶莊試製紅茶，明年旋往祁門設子莊，勸導園戶釀色，遏紅諸法，第三年，即在祁門西鄕開設紅茶莊，同時祁門南鄕有大園戶胡爺儒者，特自製園茶，以為之倡，此為徽茶改製紅茶之初。此後逐年增加紅茶莊，秋定調子兩縣遂皖省產製紅茶之區。</p>
<p>安徽產茶區域甚廣，產量極富，計有廿餘縣之多。茲將其全省產區分為五處如次：</p>
<p>徽屬各　縣：微州舊為　皖省一府，轉六縣位於皖南興江西浙西沙排江接壞，境內多山，平源較少，故農產物以茶為中心。舊時交通有新安江及昌江樂平江之上游，而以屯浮溪婺源（現劃歸贛省管轄）兩地為綰榖，茶葉集中其間。以婺源，定調子門，休寗，　縣，四縣所產較多，且為全皖冠。品質既優，而紅綠茶俱備黟縣續溪年產亦有一百餘萬石，總計全微州每年產茶額居我國輸出茶額之大宗。其中祁門所產紅茶，集中江西省內地者為多。其餘各地多產綠茶，婺源產居多，佔徽悜綠茶之半數。故微州茶亦名婺源茶，又因集中屯溪，亦名屯溪茶者。休寗歙縣產額次之，黟縣續溪所產較少，徽產茶葉除洋莊出口外，銷行蘇魯贛鄂粵京滬平津漢等省市頗多。</p>
<p>池州之建德青陽二縣：責池青陽兩縣皆皖南屬舊為池州府管轄，亦多茶產，但品質較徽州產者為次，產量無多，除自給外，輸出甚少。京滬不多見，福州漢品市塲問亦有之。</p>
<p>六安之英山霍山舒城霍邱諸縣：皆屬皖北，其出名以香片綠茶居多，如靳春　江等名稱是也，此　茶銷於上海市場最多，漢品次之福州亦有，推銷洋莊亦巨，年額不下數十萬箱·六安乃安徽北部茶葉集散地之一，每屆茶季，山東商人多有挽手車而來集市者投宿茶行，從事購採大批茶葉，從間道返山東轉售。（茶季在四月下旬至五月初旬）。</p>
<p>鳳陽壽州兩縣：亦屬皖北，均產茶。壽胡言州所產收壽春茶葉，極佳，滬人多用之，　其味香。（未完）</p>

<h3>紅蛋</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>—這裏吿訴你許多吃不到嘴的原因—</p>
<p>鷄蛋，鴨蛋，皮蛋，高郵鹹蛋，五香茶葉蛋，大爺們皮夾裏有的是法幣，總能買到吃到。但，紅蛋可就不然，除非「我的乖乖」下地之後，是不容易到嘴的，正是「踏破鐵鞋無買處，得來亳不費功夫」。</p>
<p>社會的風俗是這樣，祇有人家生男育女的時侯，喜歡得心花怒放，對於親友大送紅蛋，別人才吃到紅蛋。於是乎，「幾時吃紅蛋啊？」遂成了一句幽默的調侃話語，在社會裹流行着。</p>
<p>據說我主耶穌，是沒有爸爸的，他的媽馬利亞，接受上帝聖靈受孕，就誕生耶穌。上帝何人。聖靈何物？敝人學識淺薄，不敢妄發議論，且撇開不談。現代我們的知識，知道要得生育，必需一男一女親善合作。可是，天下有許多紅男綠女，同居多時，不能生育，何時吃紅蛋，簡直渺無消息，眞令人有望眼欲穿之威。</p>
<p>關於生育的問題，我；星相學家，到很有研究。生不生，育不育，祇要女命八字一排，男運流年一推，首已往，說將來，準不準，當場知道，靈不靈，過後方知。「閣下子息全無，…二十無子笑嬉嬉，三十無子頭也低：」，不能生育的理由，非常簡單，「命也，運也，夫復何言」？</p>
<p>「醫」，「卜」，「星」，「相」，自古並稱一流，敝人自慚愚魯，祇學得一個「醫」，命運之學，道地外行，十足的阿木林，不懂。不過我雖是個窮醫，向好窮理，不能生育的原因，在醫學上頗有一窮的需要，讀者都是聰明朋友，看吧，誰是？誰非？</p>
<p>在說到正文之前，首先要替靑年的娘兒們伸寃。</p>
<p>中國是男性為中心的社會，處處是女人吃癟，—不，現在可不盡然，—不能生育，也罪在女人。其實女人對於生育方面，祇負一半的責任。女子和男人同居數年不能生育，就斷　她是不能生育的石女，在古代列為出妻條件之一；現在，法律雖不允許，但藉詞討小老婆，預備傳宗接代，振振有詞，這眞坑死人了，那些無辜被棄的娘兒們，寃哉！寃哉！耍知道，男子不是個個生育萬能，不能生育的男人，就是討幾百個小老婆，也不中用的。</p>
<p>總之，生男育女，必須　性交合，又必須精蟲得與卵子抱合，此二者如其發生障碍，那怕你天天燒香，夜夜拜佛，雖誠不靈。現在把醫學上的不育原因，敷陳於後，諸請公鑒。</p>
<p>（甲）不能交合</p>
<p>男子的陽物，假如天生異狀，異常微小，或過於偉大，或因外傷及各種疾病，（花柳病當然也在其內）一部份破壞，或用手術截除，或瘢疤性收縮，或因其周圍的疾病，，如鼠蹊管脫腸，陰囊水腫，橡皮腫等，陽物雖能或勉强堅舉，但因上述各種障碍之一，不能達到目的，在醫學上謂之陽物器質的障碍。</p>
<p>陽物器質的障碍，珠絲馬跡，總有形可尋可覓；但這裹說的陽物機能的障碍，那就不同，外面看來儀表堂皇，可是軟弱無能，不能勃起，或勃起微弱，這種症狀，見於神經衰弱，腦髓與脊髓疾患，淫蕩及手淫過度，色情顛倒等患者，，這所謂陽萎的人，在未治愈之前，祇能望洋興嘆，過屠門大嚼罷了。</p>
<p>女子的陰道，為容納陽物，接受其射出精液之用。假使該部發生變化，先天或後天發生之異常，如鎖陰，陰戶窄狹，陰唇癒着，處女膜靱，瘢疤性陰道收小，此路不通，因此發生障碍，是謂之女性器質性陰萎。此外陰道的組織，雖沒有一點變化，但有許多精神障碍，知覺過敏的娘兒們，陽物稍近私處，陰道立起高度痙攣，結果男性不能射精。還有一種女子，因為環境的各種關係，平日抑鬱寡歡，對於人事，冷冷，淡淡，性慾的興奮，極度薄弱，子宮頸管腺分泌液稀少，男子射入之精蟲，在酸性之陰道液內，不能長久生存，失却與卵子抱合的機會，雖然「那個」了仍然不容易受胎，是謂之女性精神性陰萎。</p>
<p>（乙）狹義的生育不能</p>
<p>男性唯一的生育能力為精蟲，精蟲產生於睪丸。假如睪丸有病，不生產生精蟲，或精蟲在睪丸內已經失去生活力，或精蟲因通路障礙，不能排出等，卽不能生育，但敦倫一事，還能硬幹，實幹。</p>
<p>先天性沒有睪丸，是畸形的一種，因為不能產生精蟲，絕對不能生育。倘缺少一側，生育還有希望。</p>
<p>睪丸不下降入陰囊，潛伏於腹部，或鼠蹊管內，不能充分發育，組織萎縮，不能產生精蟲。</p>
<p>睪丸被摘除，或被愛克司光照射，喪失生產精蟲的能力。</p>
<p>睪丸因手淫及房事過度，睪丸炎，副睪丸炎（大都因淋病而起）等萎縮，機能退化。</p>
<p>睪丸梅毒，結核，腫瘍等，以至機能消失。</p>
<p>精蟲缺乏。</p>
<p>精液（精蟲浮游其內）因包皮，輸精管瘢疤收縮，腫瘍壓迫精道等，排泄發生障礙。</p>
<p>（丙）女性受胎不能</p>
<p>這一項，男性不負絲毫責任，受胎必須女性卵子與精蟲結合。女性卵巢沒有卵子產生，輸卵管因疾病閉塞不通，先天性卵巢缺少，卵巢本身疾患，此外子宮疾患等，卵子的產地，通過的路道，和胚胎的孵卵器發生了變化，當然不能受胎。</p>
<p>照上面看來，不能生育的原因多呢，究竟男女那一方面責任應當比較負得多一點，依各家的統計，並不一致，好者無關宏旨，不妨略而不說。不是討好娘兒們，替娘兒們張目，不生育的責任，她們未必負得較多吧。</p>
<h3>肺癆統計之世界觀（四）</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>北美洲諸國之死亡統計，其相差非常之高，如紐的州之一九二六年報吿，每一萬居民中有一，四八死亡例至五〇，〇死亡例之相差，此種相差之數，而欲以之研究，實為困難之事。又密歇根州，位置於美國北部之中央，自一九〇一年至一九二六年，結核之死亡例，較之南部諸州，更為减少，但密歇根之居民非常稠密，大的因外來居民之影響，而有此减少現象者，或因其南方有許多療養院之故。總之，結核死亡例减少之最大原因，由於工業之發達，生活之改善，，及防癆工作之努力。以Green氏之報吿，在克利佛蘭州，一九一〇年有十四，六死亡例，（每一萬居民中）在一九三年，僅有八，三死亡例，（每一萬居民中）此種結核死亡例减少之程度，有色人種，因其生活之標準未能盡善，似尙不能達到此境焉。</p>
<p>在墨西哥，結核之死亡例，近年亦已减少。雖墨西哥城常有種種小幸事件發生，在一九〇〇年，每一萬居民中有五〇，〇死亡例，但在一九二九年，則已减少至一三，〇死亡例矣。防癆工作之經費，多出自慈善經費。</p>
<p>在南美洲，於一九二六年，阿根廷及巴西二國有結核死亡例之報吿，因其公共衛生之不良，死亡例尙甚高。又菲列濱之防癆工作，雖已有三十年之歷史，尙不能達入安全之目的，一九二六年每一萬居民中，有二九，二七死亡例，一九二八年為二八，七六死亡例，一九三〇年為三〇，五五死亡例，又牛類被結核傳染者，在一九〇四年，有一八，四三％之士白可林陽性反應。</p>
<p>在日本及中國之情形，與以上諸境，不無相同之點。但須注意者，在各個境內之死亡例，均不相同。以彭君之意見，則中國之北部及西部，患結核者較少，中部及南部，則結核之傳染較多。中國之防癆設施在一九一三年始行發起，年前復經吳市長等發起中國防癆恊會，現已設立診療所數處，想不日定有詳細之工作報吿，足饜讀者之望，茲不贅焉。</p>
<p>在美國聖佛蘭西司可地方，中國及日本之居留民，每一萬人中有四五，九死亡例，而在別種民族，僅有九，九三死亡例，此種種觀察，令人頗為驚異，蓋結核之侵襲性，果於不同之民族間，有所不同之特殊情形矣。</p>
<p>結核問題，若以種族的立塲而論，則須特別注意其生長之地點。如黑人及印度人，在加拿大或在美國及墨西哥者，其結核死亡例，普通極為高超，而白人之在同一地點，則死亡例低减不少。又血液之混合，卽種族結婚，或可增高其抵抗力，而减少結核之死亡例，然其傳染性，並不因之减少。Grouch氏確實證明，自一九二六年至一九三〇年之中，印第安人每一萬居民中，有一三二，七死亡例，而白人僅有三三，九死亡例，最有趣者，印第安人死亡例全數三分之一，均在十五歲左右死亡。又Mantoux氏之士白可林試騐，在印第安小孩中為七五％，在混合血液者為三四至三九％，在白人為二二，六％，此種印第安人民之高度傳染，顯然由於衛生不良之所致。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（八十）惡性貧血</p>
<p>什麼呌做惡性貧血？</p>
<p>這是一種獨立的貧血症。病勢呈進行性；並不是受外界的影響像失血，中毒，生活不適當等而來的。</p>
<p>惡性貧血的起因，是怎樣的？</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>惡性貧血的原因很多，主要的是血液內或造血組織內有中毒作用，或體質自體的造血機能惡劣。其他凡條蟲的寄生，梅毒，姙娠等時候，也得起惡性貧血，大槪不外乎中毒作用。</p>
<p>惡性貧血的發生，和年齡有無關係？</p>
<p>中年（三十五到五十歲）以後，發生惡性貧血的居多。但少年有時也有發生的。</p>
<p>惡性貧血和性別有沒有關係？</p>
<p>婦人較多。</p>
<p>這種貧血的病狀，初起時覺得怎樣？</p>
<p>惡性貧血的發生，是潛伏性的，所以不能知道那一天起病的。但初起的時候，病人自己覺得倦怠，肌肉疲勞，頭痛，眩暈，耳鳴，心悸亢進，食慾不振，惡心，皮膚黏膜蒼白，有時起舌面灼熱，泄瀉，胃酸缺乏，神經症狀等。</p>
<p>後來起怎樣的病狀？</p>
<p>後來起皮膚和黏膜的蒼白，眼網膜出血，或視神經炎，呼吸頻數，心動亢進，貧血性心雜音，消化障礙，噯氣，食慾缺乏，大便秘結，脾臟腫大，小便暗褐，有時含有蛋白質，常混尿胆色素。手足有異常感覺，下肢運動失調，腱反射亢進，體溫在每天下午稍上昇。各部黏膜容易出血。</p>
<p>惡性貧血病人的血液，有何變狀。</p>
<p>血色淡白，富水分，凝固性遲緩，血淸帶暗黃色，赤血球减少，每立方耗中祇有一百五十萬甚或减到一百萬以下。血色素也减少。白血球較普通爲少，而淋巴球增加。</p>
<p>惡性貧血的經過要多少日子，預後吉兇如何？</p>
<p>經過大的要半年到一年，也有很慢達十年以上的。病勢凶惡，若不加適當治療，難免致命之虞。</p>
<p>惡性貧血的治療方法，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>治療惡性貧血，比較新的方法是肝臟療法，就是每天吃動物的肝臟或肝臟製劑，注射Campolon　LivexHepracton，等肝製劑。其次是注射砒素製劑，內服亞細亞丸，Arcylen丸。此外行輸血療法，並對於食慾不良的內服稀鹽酸百布新等消化劑。又用非直達刺激療法，像乾酪素的注射牛乳劑的注射也可一試。有人主張行脾臟摘出術的，不能通行。（完）</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>桔梗科Camdanulaceae</p>
<p>（一）桔梗Platycodon　grandiflorum，DC．</p>
<p>「植物」自生於原野，又可栽培，多年草也。莖高60—90公分。葉爲互生，有柄，作披針形或長橢圓形，邊綠有鋸齒，夏秋之候，開紫色或白色五裂之鐘狀花。蒴果爲球形。</p>
<p>「栽培法」春季播種於苗床，秋末則移植於本圃，壓條者間隔二尺，每株之間隔爲六寸。翌春新芽長出，高及一尺前後之時，則於根際添加士壤，以防倒伏。肥料則用人糞油粕等。自播種之第五年十一月至翌春三月之時，爲收穫之期。收穫時，掘根去莖，洗去泥土，於陽下曝乾而成。每畝可收生根三百七十斤左右。晒桔梗則以秋根爲佳。</p>
<p>「生藥」桔梗根Radix　Platycodonis係採集其根而乾燥之者也。本品作紡錘形，長的10—15公分，粗的三公分，彎曲分歧，大小不均。表面有縱條深皺，類似黃褐色，質地粗糙。破折面爲纖維性，呈白色或淡黃色。味苦。</p>
<p>根之橫斷面，外形不齊，屈曲之外圍，被暗褐色之抱層，內部則爲白色。皮部厚處，與木部大略相同，處處現出裂隙。沿褐色之環錢，爲新生組織。篩管部及脈管部，作褐色放射狀之綫形。</p>
<p>橫斷面於顯微鏡下檢視，皮部純由柔組織而成，有石核細胞處，不雜纖維。在第二期皮部，有多數乳管，脈管的爲一列。</p>
<p>晒桔梗，爲剝去根之抱層而乾燥之者也。表面類似白色，質地輕鬆。</p>
<p>「成分」根中含有Kikyosaponin　C29H48O11。本Saponin若與酸混和煮沸，加水分解如次：　　C29H48O11+H2O=C23H38O6+C6（Galactose)</p>
<p>就本植物之Saponin，日人梅辻氏及大鹿氏等，均有相當研究。</p>
<p>「藥理」梅辻氏所得之桔梗Saponin，於一萬倍溶液中，呈完全之溶血作用。大鹿氏所得之桔梗Saponin，則較前者更有强力。桔梗Saponin對鼠之致死量，爲體重十公分之鼠，施以七·七公絲之皮下注射卽可。</p>
<p>「藥用」舊說：桔梗根作袪痰藥及咽喉病之用。一日用量爲八公分，作煎劑用，但屢加入甘草。</p>
<p>處方例：桔梗湯，有袪痰，鎭咳之效。</p>
<p>桔梗四·〇甘草八·〇</p>
<p>以上爲煎劑二〇〇，一日三回分服。</p>
<p>新藥：以桔梗根製成之新藥如次。</p>
<p>Platycodin（桔梗根流浸膏。）</p>

<p>玻璃體是一種無色透明膠樣的物質。在眼球的後部。充滿於水晶體，毛樣體，及網膜包圍的玻璃體腔。牠的形狀。略呈球形。亦具屈光作用。前面是與水晶體相接。接觸部呈皿狀陷落。玻璃體內自己並無固有的神經及血管。牠的營養，是由隣接的葡萄膜所供給的。所以在內眼膜疾患譬如網膜炎，脈絡膜炎，及毛樣體炎等時。玻璃體亦常被影響。</p>
<p>講到玻璃體混濁的原因。大都是由梅毒性或結核性葡萄膜炎或網膜脈絡膜炎而起。其他在急性傳染病後，强度近視，網膜剝離，及玻璃體出血後等等。亦可發生玻璃體混濁。混濁的程度，並不一樣。有玻璃體全體存在的，有限局於前部或後部的，或個個散在的。混濁的形狀，各有不同。微細者如塵埃。稍大者如點狀，絮狀，絲狀，斑狀，及膜狀。這等混濁常致引起患者視力障碍。患者眼球運動時。覺有暗點浮動於視界。宛如夏天晚間飛蚊的樣子。這就是所謂飛蚊症。我們若用徹照法的檢查。大都容易察見混濁。於赤色的瞳孔領內。見有黑色或灰白色不透明或半透明的塵埃，點，絮，絲，斑，膜等狀混濁。若患者眼球向上下或左右運動。則又能見混濁浮游於眼內。如若合併玻璃體融解症。則眼球雖不運動。亦得察見混濁物的浮動。</p>
<p>本病首當醫治原因病。試用吸收劑及誘導療法。注意全身營養的狀態。如屬梅毒性，則尤宜施行驅梅療法。</p>
<p>再者健康眼晴，在注視白色牆壁或天空的時候。往往覺有半透明滴狀，絮狀，或絲狀的暗點。這是因爲在胎生的時期。玻璃體中殘有細胞及結締組織纖維的綠故。在醫學上，特稱之爲生理的玻璃體混濁。中等度的近視眼，較易發生。此種混濁的特徵。有四：卽　暗點的數目，大約一定，常不增加。　暗點多固定而不動，但眼球運動時，當亦隨之而動。　患者視力不生障碍。及　若用徹照法的檢查，常常不能證明混濁。</p>
<p>生理的玻璃體混濁，常可不必加以治療。</p>
<h3>牙齒常識問答（二十七）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一三二問）　漱口藥水，爲什麼要請醫牛選配爲妥？</p>
<p>答　因爲各人的口腔情形不同，特種的口腔狀况，應該用特種的漱口藥水。譬方像口中酸質過多的人，牙齒容易蛀蝕，應該多用些鹼性的藥配合，可以中和酸質。若是口內唾液中鹼性過多，齒石積聚，容易發生齒槽膿漏症，則鹼性藥就不必多用。大槪普通人口中，酸質爲患的居多。</p>
<p>（第一三三問）　市上所售的漱口藥水，價多昂貴，有沒有價廉物美的漱口藥水，自己可以常時配合應用嗎？</p>
<p>答　有二種：第一種就是石灰水，祗要買數十文的生石灰，用水化開，讓牠放熱沉澱，把上面的淸水濾出，用瓶裝好，或者把水和底下沉降的石灰一齊用器貯藏，候上面的水將近用完後，再行加水，這樣可以常時有飽和量的石灰水應用，用石灰水漱口時，可和些溫水，以免味道太濃。第二種就是生理食鹽水，或用百分之一食鹽水亦可，配裝時祇耍用一份食鹽，和百分開水卽得，這二種實在是最易配製，最經濟而又最良好的漱口水，家庭應該常備，不時取用，若是食鹽水中和以少量石灰水，兩相冲和，效更美滿，石灰水又可用來冲入牛奶，給小兒吃，可以帮助牛奶的消化。</p>
<p>（第一三四問）　口中酸質過多的人，牙齒應該怎樣防護？</p>
<p>答　口中唾液失常，酸質過多的人，牙齒易蛀，而且極爲敏覺，局部的救濟，在求中和口內的酸質，下列幾種藥物，可以採用：</p>
<p>（一）小蘇打：用一小匙小蘇打，冲一茶杯開水，常常漱口，食後和睡前應漱一次。</p>
<p>（二）石灰水：上面已經述過，可以常用漱口。</p>
<p>（三）鎂乳：用於刷牙後，至少每日睡前須用一次。用法取一匙鎂乳，傾入口內，藉舌和頰的動作，把牠塗佈於牙齒面上，此法很爲有效。</p>
<p>（四）炭酸鈣或炭酸鎂製的牙粉，亦有中和酸質之效。</p>
<p>（第一三五問）　齒石有什麼害處？</p>
<p>答　齒石的性質，在上面第八九問裹頭，已經說過，牠的害處很多，第一，牠能刺激牙肉，漸至紅腫發炎，容易出血，甚至化膿，而成爲齒槽膿漏症。第二，牠爲口腔細菌停駐的大本營，釀成蛀牙，口炎和喉炎的根據地。第三，牠愈積愈厚，牙肉因受壓逼而退縮，牙齒根部露出，容易動搖。第四，牠能破壞牙齒的美觀，使潔白的牙齒，蒙着各種污穢的顔色。</p>

<h3>祝福與咒詛</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>倫敦聖保羅大敎堂主敎，於前晚舉行盛大公開祈禱會，爲目下各國担負時局艱難重任者祝福。英皇愛德華八世及其僚屬。法國大總統勒勃倫與其他閣員，德元首希特勒，及其他各國重要行政長官，均名列其內。惟聞希氏之爲英敎堂列入於公開祈禱文中，此尙爲第一次。</p>
<p>邇來歐洲時局，屢呈動亂，以致入心惶惶，莫不以大難之將至爲懼。由是各國敎堂，常爲和平而祈禱，希望慈悲的上帝，能垂念蒼生之困，使世界化禍爲福。前年美洲巴玻之戰正酣，在救主誕那天，敎會曾向雙方籲請停戰一日，好讓戰塲上的壯士，也得受主的賜，休息一下。去年同日，東菲意阿對峙，敎堂亦作過同樣的要求。有一回，羅馬敎皇，且曾舉行一和平祈禱大會，下令全世界敎徒，連績禱告三天。這都是敎徒一種博愛精神的表現，可惜祈禱儘管祈禱，人類的浩刦，還是無法避免的。束菲一塲大戰，就死傷了無數生靈。這恐怕是天意，非人力所能挽回。不然，敎徒的禱吿，不能不說是心誠而意虔的。</p>
<p>這次英國聖保羅大敎堂主敎，許是因爲看到一向和平祈禱之無效，故便改變一個方式，爲歐洲現在各政治領袖祝福。這用意也是極好的。蓋被祈禱這些重要執政人物，適逢此大時代，身負時局鉅任，委實也太辛苦，應該給他們祈禱一下，向上帝乞恩，保佑他個個政躬康强，來為人類謀安寗。不見希氏從來未曾為英國敎堂列入於公開祈禱之中，這回想是因為覺得他對歐局舉足輕重，故也給他祝一次福。</p>
<p>不過常人的態度，便和敎徒不同了。對於世界各國若干政治頗袖，他們時發咒詛之聲。原因這班大人物，大都抱有一種野心。他們表面未嘗不口口聲聲說愛好和平，實際却彼此各在勾心鬥角，凖備屠殺。他們渴望在自己的鐵腕下，成就一番英雄事業。今日世局之紛紛攘攘，無非由他們所擺弄。而人類的命運，就是被握在他們手里，任他們的支配。他們這般橫衝直撞，以一己的意志爲意志，大家自然便不會對他們有什麼好感。</p>
<h3>「朝天館」</h3>
<p>— 郭卡</p>
<p>——旅中小記</p>
<p>車離開濟南時就下起雪來了。把額角貼上冰凉的玻璃片，從車窗子望出去，閃爍的電燈漸漸望不見了，眼睛就嵌住了一片輸廓模糊的大野。車里的燈光，透過窗子，在路旁的斜坡上迅速的擦過，地是漸漸的變白了；在窗外的光影中，還不時的有一朶朵無主的雪花搖搖的閃過，或是疲倦的貼在窗玻璃上，化成水滴，灣灣的向下流着。</p>
<p>我悵然的抽轉身，向大半旅客都已入睡的車廂輕吁了一口氣，幾天來的跋踄，忽然又遇到這樣的雪天，對明天的旅途竟得有點祖心。</p>
<p>半夜過去了，在一陣騷動中，我從睡夢里睜開了眼睛，外面月台上有個人正在搖着鈴粗嗄的喊着：</p>
<p>「濰縣濰縣……」</p>
<p>我忪惺的抓起行李來，走下車，湧出這縣城的小車站去。</p>
<p>這時正是夜里三點鐘，在黑影中有幾個人圍上來搶我行李，一邊還七嘴八舌的喊着些小客棧的名子。我的行李被一個人搶去後，我就跟着他走，到了一家客棧的樓上，他領我進一間大的房間去，這房間里順着一面是一排很長的通舖，另外又有兩張單人木床，有一個小商模樣的旅客，也像剛來不久的樣子，我草草的洗洗臉，下去到帳房里問明天的汽車是不照常開行？那老板抽着水烟袋露出點職業的微笑說道：</p>
<p>「若是不再下了，這點雪不礙事」。</p>
<p>但再下呢，却就很難說了！於是我就担心的不時的推開窗子看雪，雪正恣意的翻飛着，沒有絲毫停止的意思。窗下有一架驟車，一匹站在雪里的騾子，不時的響動着他那頸上的小銅鈴，發出了一種鬱苦的聲音。</p>
<p>早晨醒來時，天已大明，趕緊推開窗子，雪像是停止了，天却仍是那樣子。我回轉身往樓下跑，却碰到了我同住的旅伴，他說：</p>
<p>「沒有事了，今天車不能開，咱們都是一路的」。</p>
<p>我退回去，簡略的和他談幾句以後才知道他是這小客棧的熟客，老是來回的在這路上跑的。談了回以後，他說：</p>
<p>「走，我們吃點飯去，吃朝天飯館？—到濰縣不吃朝天飯那太冤枉了！」</p>
<p>「什麼是朝天飯」？我莫名其妙問。</p>
<p>「吃吃試試好吧？這是濰縣的特產。」</p>
<p>我就好奇的無聊賴的跟着他走。這時雪又下起來，泥濘的地上，被騾子所踏成的半圓圈里，聚積着一灣灣的雪水。</p>
<p>拉開一扇油膩的風門，我們邁進一間油暈氣很重的屋里去，這屋子正中放着一口沸騰的鍋，鍋四圍是一圈紅色木質鍋台，看去恰像一口大火鍋擺在一張小圓桌上。這時因爲天氣冷，時間還早，屋里冷冷淸淸的沒有一個顧客，連店老板還是我們喊了幾聲才從里屋跑出來了。那老板一出來就嘻開他油膩的嘴臉說：</p>
<p>「來得正好，肉剛煮出來」！</p>
<p>照着那位朋友的樣子，我也就在那些散擺在鍋台四週圍的油漆小檯子上坐下，那老板馬上給擺住兩隻碗，兩雙劈柴樣的筷子，鍋沿上扣着若干木質小勺，我那朋友揀起一隻來，在那沸騰的煮着肉的鍋里，把漂的油花的湯一勺勺搯在自己碗里，然後又搯了一勺來凑近嘴邊，慢慢的噓了兩口，這才放下勺子說道：</p>
<p>「給我各樣都來點，要肥的，多來點肥腸」。</p>
<p>說完後他又向我：</p>
<p>「你呢」？</p>
<p>「來點肝吧」。我隨便的說。</p>
<p>那老板切好一份，裝在隻漏勺里，放在那起浪頭的鍋里煮着，接着就拿起張大而厚的餅來，把肉捲在餅里，莽壯的遞給了我那朋友。我感到濃厚的與趣接過了我那捲餅，噓了點湯，覺得有點「吃不消」，捲着肝的餅却還好，很過癮，並且佐以大葱鹹菜，更味道十足，頗有梁山泊風味！</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>我邊吃着邊從塞滿了餅嘴里吐出句問話來：</p>
<p>「這爲什麽呌朝天館呢」？</p>
<p>那老板撩起圍裙，擦着兩隻油膩的大手答道：</p>
<p>「那是因爲早年都開在街上，鍋口朝天，現在却多半弄在屋里了」。</p>
<p>我那同伴，嚼着滿嘴餅：吶吶的說道：</p>
<p>「也呌做雜碎鍋，還有人呌饞癆鍋子，哈哈」！</p>
<p>有幾塊餅屑跟吐沫星子，隨着那同伴的大笑噴了出來。</p>
<p>吃完後，從那里泥壺邊接過杯黯紅的茶來，一氣灌進去，就噓着葱臭，踏上風雪的街道。</p>
<h3>老職員</h3>
<p>— 舒芒</p>
<p>淡淡的陽光照在沈沈的辦公室的窗玻璃上。在一縷像水流一樣的日光中，人看得見無數的塵埃在流動。一切都現得那麽死寂，那麽陰沈。文具櫃，案，宗卷，簿冊……一切把人的腦子不住地攪亂着的討厭而可怕的東西，全死挺挺地排列着，像殯房裏的屍棺，在這些東西中間，人爲了生活，便那麽平凡地把自己的精力，把自己的靑春，把自己的希望與歡笑，一齊無言地埋葬了……。</p>
<p>王書記從一頁工楷的文件上抬起頭來，放下筆，鬆一鬆年老的酸痛而有點麻木了的手臂，沈重的頭腦使他心頭覺得有一種近於作嘔的難過，而從窗子裏流進來的那屋子裏唯一的太陽的光流也刺得他底眼睛發花：眼前彷彿是漆黑的一團團而在這漆黑的一團中却又有着迷亂的紛擾的雜色，他無可奈何地閃上了眼睛，把身體靠到椅背上去，緊緊地攏着兩手，手上是淋漓的冷汗。</p>
<p>「到底到了年紀，可實在不行了啊……」</p>
<p>眞的，王書記的確感到自己一天天地在衰老下去了。五十多歲的人，每天在陰暗而沒有陽光的角落裏抄上萬把字的工楷！那樣，算起來竟有十九年了。十九年！是個多麽長的年頭啊！爲了自己底妻兒與老娘，爲了始終超不出五十元一月的薪水，他把他過往的歲月埋葬了十九年！而今，生活的担子依然重重的壓着，而自己却只能謹謹愼愼地把這個事情守着。十九年！從前的同事，而今，都靠了自己的「手叚」與別人的「面子」飛黃騰達的爬得老高了，而他，直到近六十歲的十九年後今天，却依舊是個拿五十元一月的「王書記」，沒有「手叚」，也沒有「面子」。然而，自己是一天天地支持不住，一天天地在衰老下去了—前幾個月，就接連被上司在他所抄寫的文件上發現了許多錯誤，他被上司呌了去，在一種譏笑的神氣中說「你老也眞太辛苦了，這麽大的年紀……」—可是生活的担子是重重地壓着的啊。</p>
<p>想到這裏，王書記覺得閉着乾枯的眼睛有一點潤濕，他慘然了。一綫生活的哀愁像猛烈的燒酒那樣的直鑽到心裏。他微微地張開眼睛，用手巾拭了拭，舒了口氣，便握起冷而硬的筆桿，醮了墨，便用了那他十九年來的習慣，小心而藉口愼地，一個字一個字地寫下去了；「查……」</p>
<p>靜夜中，門碰地開了，一個聽差走到王書記的面前，低聲地說：「王先生，陸科長請你馬上就去。」</p>
<p>心裏想了一下，「不要又長什麽地方弄錯了吧……？」那麽想着，茫然地放下了筆，就跟着聽差走出去。</p>
<p>這一回，陸科長顯得特別客氣：「王先生，很辛苦吧……是的，這裏的事情實在太辛苦了，王先生進來有……？」</p>
<p>「十九年了，科長。」</p>
<p>「是的是的，十九年，比兄弟的資格還老了，可敬可敬，應當稱老前輩了啊，是不是？哈哈哈哈……王先生今年貴庚是……？」</p>
<p>「五十八了。」</p>
<p>「是的是的，十九年來，王先生在這裏辦事，成績很是……我們欽佩，可是，我看王先生年紀老了，過份的辛勞很使我們不安，我們爲了王先生着想……所以……所以……這里是……請你看一看……」</p>
<p>遞過一個信封來，王書記檔着手抽出來看：是一張辭退書！</p>
<p>猛地一驚，王書記呆住了「要來的終於已經來到，」一切紛雜的問題都不能再想了，蹌蹌地走出大門，街上的太陽依舊照得很旺。</p>
<p>他計算着，看不見星期一上午的街上的太陽，已經有十九年了……</p>
<h3>生活失敗了的人</h3>
<p>— 天騏</p>
<p>在旅店的客廳里，無意碰見一個在鎭上做靑菓罐頭生意的近房叔輩。前幾年我每回回家經過松鎭，若是時間還早，都會到他店里看看他們夫妻。那時侯正是他「生意興隆」的得意時期；他的鼻頭本來生得又紅又亮，人家都呌他「紅鼻公」，人又善談吐，在那個時侯一種神飛意揚的言談丰度，時時在他那個又紅又亮的鼻頭上表露出來。這晚不期的會見，在白亮刺眼的瓦斯燈光下，我略一打量他，家常便服外面套了一件舊大氅，那個最惹人注目的紅鼻頭，彷彿已消褪了往昔那種飛揚紅亮的神色，變得寒傖起來。他似乎很高興，喊着我的名字。我隨讓他到房里坐下，寒喧之後兩人就交談起來。</p>
<p>他開頭恭維我「衣錦榮旋」，使得我面上紅了一陣又一陣。談鋒一轉就落到市情上來了。這時幾乎都是他一人開口說話，他嘆氣搖頭，週而復始的說生意是推一天算一天。無現欵交去，上頭貨物搬不動，有了貨又賣不出去。過往的「番客」雖然此往年多，又都是僅有一付水脚的「臘鴨」。前回節賬開不出，把家里僅有的三擔穀田都賣了，再說了一大套家庭的風波，看他樣子眞像要哭了出來。</p>
<p>這時他呷了一口茶，低聲說：</p>
<p>——眞料不到時衰運敗一至於此！你不知道，那是上半年的事，我就不該背着那個「老虎嫲」娶了她來，當時還說家里也有兩三擔穀田地，總要有個人去管看纔像了家，那里就料到今日……。</p>
<p>原來他背着大老婆在家里娶了一個女人，及到生意敗落，田又賣完，沒法子再按月供給她一人的生活費，逼得那個女人走下店是來，鬧了個天翻地覆，現在店是一切銀錢進出都操在大老婆手里，那個女人站不住脚又退回家里去了。</p>
<p>自始至終我沒有對他說過一句話，我只覺得這是破落的小市民的不可避免的命運，在扶梯邊我把他送出去了。</p>
<p>第二天一早起來準備往搭開縣城的汽車，趕到車站時車差不多就開了，剛佔好坐位，一回頭，沒有嵌玻璃的車窗外面，忽然推進一個頭來，他很抱歉似地要我去和他說一句話，在車站右邊的僻角里，他畏怯怯地從大憋袋里摸出兩隻大柑，塞到我手里來，左手再遞過一隻紙包，嘴凑到我耳朶邊說：</p>
<p>—這里是五十隻毫仔，煩勞老姪台替我交給她，幷代我說……</p>
<p>說到這里他回過頭去，望了望又說</p>
<p>—老姪台是讀書開通人，你就代我對她說：「你要走只管走，不走也隨便，不過以後我養不起你，兩條路任你揀一條走就是了。」臨了又可嚀我要代他守秘密。</p>
<p>喇叭呌了，我一手拿着柑子，一手握着一包銀亳，想到這個人的失敗，哪個女人的前途，心是像吃了什麽油膩的束西，只覺得萬分的悶塞。</p>
<p>汽車已在崎峭的山路上顛簸前進了。（歸程瑣記）</p>

<p>生命之路</p>
<p>華弱男—不願意被父親當作升官發財的買賣貨品，因此她就脫離了家庭，一個人逃到上海來，一個沒有錢的女子，要想住在上海過生活，當然是很難很難的，她又不願意到工廠裏去做工，給那工頭們及小職員的調笑，又不願做公司商店裏去做花瓶，願意當女敎員却沒有人介紹，寫稿子去投寄各報，文壇上又不認識一個人，在這樣無辦法之中，因此欠了米店裏的米錢，還欠了房東的二個月房錢。</p>
<p>米店裏的米先生來討米錢，結果在無辦法之中只好回了轉去。</p>
<p>房東的女兒房小姐代母親來要房錢，說今天非給不可，弱男告訴她等家裏寄錢馬上給你們，房小姐是不能允許，房小姐又說女人家在上海會沒有生路嗎？只要肯馬虎一點，弄一點錢不是很容易嗎？弱男聽到這話巳够傷心了，她吿訴出來，她爲了要生活已經出賣過二次靈魂與肉體……　　她的父親得到弱男表兄的報吿。同她哥哥—國英一同找到這裏來要她回去！與那陳師長結婚，可是弱男是再也不肯跟父親回去了！她堅决的不願意做陳師長的姨太太，讓父親把自己當作升官發財的買賣貨品。</p>
<p>正在雙方爭論的時候，弱男的愛人—一風，在漢口得到信息而來找她，看到這情形，他就阻止她父親與哥哥這弱男回家去。一忽兒—弱男說出她爲了生活的逼迫，巳經做過奴女，出賣過二次靈魂與肉體，父親聽到這話，氣得發昏，再也不要弱男回去。父女的情感到這時一點也沒有了，父親反而把她駡了一頓，同國英頭也不回的出去了！</p>
<p>這時候弱男是完全覺悟到父親要她的原因，並不是爲了父女之愛，完全爲了將她當作買賣貨品！……</p>
<p>一風告訴弱男我們要生活只有掙扎奮鬥！</p>

<p>開篇「春閨詞」</p>
<p>小桃紅遍上林春。蘇堤春曉柳搖金。陌頭柳色靑如許。雨打芭蕉深閉門。蝶戀花飛春欲去。落花天氣最關心深閨倒垂珠箔。鳥驚喧鳴護落英。那柳娘三醉楊妃榻。雙聲恨殺這負心人。我與他，三潭印月初相會。柳綫長繋你我心。他愛我，孔雀開屛美豔色。我愛他，垂鞭走馬是王孫。在西湖曾訂鸳鸯誓。好比，雙飛蝴蝶往來頻。有時節，桃李爭春留倩影。有時節，白頭吟詠勸斯文。那曉得，醉翁撈月成空望。恨東皇四季不常春。旱天雷電驀然臨。正是東方舞劍起。他衛國衛民上海行。驟唱陽關三疊曲。樽前三醉別長亭。我願他，賽龍奪錦歸來早。雙鳳朝陽醉太平。彼此歡娛樂昇平。誰知，小苑春回他未返。雁落平沙少信音。迥文錦就何由達。寄生草跡本無根。如今團扇秋風泣。比昭君怨恨更凄清。燭影搖紅成孤寂。浪聲梅影嘆飄零。恨比瀟湘曲水深。</p>
<p>徐文璧開篇</p>

<p>開篇「受吐」</p>
<p>玉人歌舞未曾回。寂寞秦樓冷翠台。寳鏡未收簾上起。聽得更聲梆鼓催。懶洋洋。意徘徊。喜見花魁帶醉歸。酒醉香腮紅兩頰。無奈翠袖落兩隨。鴇兒扶住嬌無力。美怨含羞頭懶抬。鴇媽含歡稱有客。佳人沉醉不能陪。上牙床星眼朦朧睡。秦種是。迢迢良夜伴香聞。即取衣巾親受吐。呼茶隨謁進露杯。金雞喚醒遊仙夢。請問郎君却是誰。小娘子。小可賣油名秦種。去春得見慕卿才。積取花銀度良會。昨夜巧逢帶醉歸。奉　放吐親承受。急速取衣是我偕。佳人聽說稱難得。味了君家罪不該。秦種果然眞情重。有緣種種謝多才。細叮嚀何日再重來。</p>

<h3>Puppet Government in Eastern Hebei Establishes Inspection Posts and Collects Taxes</h3>
<p>The Tianjin East Station is Unable to Thoroughly Suppress Smuggling A Large Number of Shipments are Detained in Zhifu</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet government in Eastern Hebei has set up inspection posts at the Beitang Railway Station on the Beining Railway to collect customs duties on smuggled goods coming from the Beidaihe area. Ronin have established the Asahi Transportation Company at Liushouying in Beidaihe, the Zheng Rong Trading Company's transportation department in Changli, the Nandasi Transportation Company in Nandasi, and the Changhong Company in Jixian, specializing in transporting smuggled goods. Each company and trading firm has dozens to hundreds of die-hard followers, equipped with weapons and wearing Youth League badges. They are extremely fierce and stubborn. The puppet government in eastern Hebei has established a total of eight customs inspection posts in Liushouying, Beidaihe, Yanghekou, Dahuangkou, Changli, Aoxian, Beitang, and Tanggu from the 1st, all of which are managed by certain foreign customs officials in collaboration with Chinese to collect taxes.

According to the Tianjin Customs, although the new method of suppressing smuggling has not been effective, the ronin at the East and West Stations in Tianjin can no longer be as convenient as before, so there are fewer shipments. Only the East Station is unable to thoroughly suppress smuggling due to the special circumstances. Currently, the East Station is the center of the problem, and the Railway Bureau is studying thorough solutions. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Speaks on "The World is for the Public"</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin gave a speech on the 6th at the National Government's Memorial Week on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching that "The World is for the Public," generally saying that the "The World is for the Public" mentioned by Dr. Sun Yat-sen contains not only the essence of the "Great Dao in Practice" in the Book of Rites, but also the significance of the times. Therefore, the "Great Dao in Practice" that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of has more concrete content and more concrete methods. This "Great Dao" is the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People is the Great Dao that Dr. Sun Yat-sen proclaimed to future generations. It is a most complete plan formulated based on the supreme principle of "The World is for the Public." In the current era, we can determine that if we want a world community, we must first put "The World is for the Public" into practice. To put "The World is for the Public" into practice, we must implement the Three Principles of the People. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of "The World is for the Public" contains the following four meanings: Racial Liberation: This is the first era of significance interpreted from the standpoint of the nation, that is, the liberation of the nation. Political Liberation: This is the second era of significance interpreted from the standpoint of civil rights, that is, the liberation of civil rights. Economic Liberation: This is the third era of significance interpreted from the standpoint of people's livelihood, that is, the liberation of people's livelihood. Human Liberation: This is the fourth era of significance interpreted from the standpoint of human equality and liberation, that is, the entire liberation of mankind. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's entire idea of "The World is for the Public" lies in this. He decided that since Dr. Sun Yat-sen had the idea of "The World is for the Public," he did not directly advocate cosmopolitanism, but advocated nationalism. The reason is that Dr. Sun Yat-sen explained clearly in the third lecture of nationalism that nationalism is the only tool to achieve cosmopolitanism. Losing the tool of nationalism means not being able to achieve the goal of cosmopolitanism. Dr. Sun Yat-sen saw this very clearly and spoke of it most clearly and sincerely. At the end, he said that now there are inevitably many young people who, because they hold the noble idea of "The World is for the Public," think that nationalism is outdated or that it is not thorough enough, and think that advocating cosmopolitanism is more in line with the truth of "The World is for the Public," thus going astray, obstructing the national revival, and becoming a criminal who endangers the country. This is because they have not carefully studied China's current environment and the demands of the times, and have lost the green domination of temporality and spatiality. Now, our country's national revival movement, seeking national independence and liberation, is very important and urgent. Therefore, I specially propose "The World is for the Public" for everyone to study. We must know that cosmopolitanism is the ideal of "The World is for the Public," and nationalism is the necessary stage to implement "The World is for the Public." We must not mess up our steps. We must see the environment clearly, understand the times, grasp the space and time, and concentrate the power of the whole country to shoulder the mission of the times. I hope that everyone will have a more in-depth study and more practical development of this point, so that everyone will have an unshakable example of faith in the Three Principles of the People. Only then can China be saved, and the noble ideal of "The World is for the Public" and the ultimate goal of a world community can be truly realized. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Key Points for Handling Local Budgets</h3>
<p>Security Expenses Will be Organized Separately</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 25th year local general budgets of Weibu and Yuning provinces have been sent to the Ministry of Finance for review. In addition to asking other provinces and cities to send them in accordance with the legal time limit, the Ministry of Finance has also formulated three points for attention in addition to the five standards for handling local budgets previously issued, and telegraphed each province and city to comply with them: Absolutely live within one's means, using the average of the actual receipts in the past three years as the standard. For all local undertakings, it is necessary to rectify inherent taxes to cope with them, and no new taxes or levies may be added. Each locality should maintain the various tax rates approved in the 24th year and should not change them. In addition, the ministry believes that local security expenses all come from surcharges or apportionments, and most of them are budgeted separately. If this continues, there will be provincial security fees in the provinces and county security fees in the counties. Outside the budget, there is another budget, and outside the surcharge, there is another apportionment. If these are not rectified, the achievements of abolishing exorbitant taxes and levies will be in vain, and may even become more serious. Two rectification methods are now formulated: Security expenses should be included in the provincial budget in their entirety. Security expenses are limited to no more than 10% of the total provincial budget. This rectification method will be implemented together when reviewing the 25th year local budget. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that local efforts to rectify finances in recent years have generally had considerable results. However, the situation in each county differs within a large province. It is difficult to understand the extent of the rectification and whether there are any difficulties without actual investigation. In addition to successively ordering various committees of the local tax supervision committee to go to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Shaanxi and other provinces for on-site investigation, with a view to further rectification, it also intends to take advantage of the central government's decision to focus on promoting county and city administration to vigorously promote the local financial rectification plan that has not yet been implemented in various meetings over the years. Gao Bingfang, director of the Ministry's Tax Department, reported on this matter in detail at the Ministry's Memorial Week this morning. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Prospects for Austria's Restoration of Conscription — Li</h3>
<p>After the Great War, Austria was bound by the treaties of Saint-Germain and others, which abolished conscription and limited the army to no more than 30,000 men. Recently, stimulated by Germany's rearmament, Austria intends to break free from these restrictions and expand its military. On the 1st of this month, the Austrian Parliament resolved to restore conscription, requiring all healthy men between the ages of 18 and 42 to perform labor or military service, in order to increase Austria's existing army from 30,000 to 150,000 men. Although this resolution appears to be merely a continuation of the "fait accompli" advocated by Germany, the impact on the European situation is worth noting.</p>
<p>Firstly, Austria's conscription is related to the issue of German-Italian rivalry in Central Europe. To resolve its domestic economic crisis and consolidate the "Nazi" regime, Germany must strive for outward expansion and establish hegemony in Central Europe, seizing the economic interests of the Danube River basin, thereby extending its influence to Southern Europe. Annexing Austria is, of course, an important step in this plan, and in fact, the merger of Germany and Austria has become one of the practical political programs of the Third Reich. However, Italy, the originator of Fascism, also covets the economic interests of the Danube River basin. Mussolini believes that seizing these interests would be enough to alleviate part of Italy's economic crisis. Moreover, Austria controls the upper reaches of the Danube and is the gateway to the Balkans. If Italy wants to consolidate the Brenner Pass border, it must first build a strong bulwark in Austria. Therefore, Italy is constantly guarding against Germany's southward invasion and is willing to fully support Austria to make it its own vassal. After Germany decided to abandon the Locarno Pact and marched into the Rhineland with great fanfare, Italy, fearing that Germany would annex Austria with swift and overwhelming force, convened a meeting of the three countries of Italy, Austria, and Hungary in Rome to discuss how to strengthen the military strength of the three-country group to counter Germany's policy towards Austria. Austria's decision to restore conscription came precisely after the three-country meeting. Although the Austrian Foreign Minister stated that this was unrelated to the three-country meeting, given the current situation in Central Europe, we cannot help but suspect that Austria's move was at least partly instigated by Italy.</p>
<p>Secondly, Austria's restoration of conscription has already aroused opposition from the Little Entente countries, but the attitude of the Little Entente countries so far does not seem to be very firm. This is because France is likely to tacitly approve of Austria's conscription. France believes that Austria's move is tantamount to building a dike on the other side of the Danube River to prevent Germany from developing into Central Europe. Although this may also strengthen Austria's oppression of the Little Entente countries, increase Italy's influence in Central Europe, and affect France's existing influence in Central Europe and its investment market in Austria, France, under the premise of trying to control Germany by holding Italy, can only tacitly approve it. As for Britain, although it believes that Austria's move will inevitably enhance Italy's power in the Mediterranean, it has never actively intervened in Central European issues, and in fact, Central Europe is beyond its reach, so it will naturally take a wait-and-see attitude for the time being. Given the international situation, it can be seen that Austria's restoration of conscription will not encounter much resistance.</p>
<p>Now Hungary, following Austria, has also expressed its demand for equal rights to expand its military. The simultaneous rearmament of Austria and Hungary will, on the one hand, make the Little Entente countries, formed by the loss of territory by the two countries, feel a deeper threat, and on the other hand, it will also intensify the contradictions between Germany and Italy. "The mountain rain is about to come, and the wind fills the building" is precisely the situation in Central Europe today.</p>

<h3>France's Reply Completed: No More Concessions to Germany; Peace Proposal Contains Two Items: Rhineland Demilitarization, Intolerable</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French Foreign Minister is still consulting with experts on the content of France's reply to Hitler's peace plan. It is now believed here that France's reply can be summarized in one sentence: it will take an uncompromising attitude. (Reuters Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government's peace plan (i.e., the reply to the German memorandum), which is to be submitted to the governments of Britain, Belgium, and Italy, as well as the Council of the League of Nations, has been drafted. The cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss it. It contains several constructive proposals to preserve European peace and prevent the recurrence of "faits accomplis." There are approximately two proposals: 1. Germany must not build defensive fortifications in the Rhineland area, because if it does, when Germany conducts aggression against Central Europe, it will only need to deploy a small number of troops in Western Europe to prevent France from intervening. 2. An international army should be organized immediately and assigned to the League of Nations for dispatch, so that it can be used to deal with acts that violate the League of Nations Covenant in the future. Regarding the first proposal, when the second meeting of the Locarno Pact is held in Geneva on Wednesday or Thursday of this week, the French representative will urge the representatives of other countries to adopt it as soon as possible. However, the second proposal is listed in the third part of the French peace plan (the French reply is divided into three parts). This plan will not be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for discussion until next month, after the French parliamentary elections are over. (Havas Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today that France is prepared to take military action to counter German leader Hitler's disregard for the restrictions stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact and to build fortifications in the Rhineland. The French delegation attending the staff talks in London will reportedly demand that Britain, France, and Belgium seriously warn Germany, stating that Germany's construction of fortifications in the area is no longer tolerable for France, and that the three countries should take concerted action to counter it. (National News Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The reply that the French government should submit to the German memorandum was drafted by Foreign Minister Flandin, with the help of members of the ministry. The members continued to work hard today, and the Foreign Minister summarized their work at his private residence, working tirelessly throughout the day until the draft was completed in the afternoon. At 7:00 PM in the evening, Flandin met with Prime Minister Sarraut and Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, and made final adjustments to the wording of the reply. Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ray, Director of the Political Department Paget, Assistant Director Massigli, and legal advisor Bartet were also present. According to information gathered by the diplomatic reporter of this newspaper from reliable sources, the content of the French reply is divided into three parts, and each part answers the German memorandum point by point. (The first part of the German memorandum explains the reasons for abolishing the demilitarized zone system and the Locarno Pact from a legal and political perspective; the second part is the 19-point peace plan; and the third part is the proposal on arms limitation.) It is not yet known whether this reply will be handed over to the governments of Britain, Belgium, and Italy in Geneva when the 13-nation committee of the Council of the League of Nations meets, or whether it will be sent to the relevant countries through diplomatic channels. However, the first method is more likely. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Three Important International Conferences This Week</h3>
<p>Locarno Treaty Signatory Conference; Anglo-Franco-Belgian Staff Talks; League of Nations 13-Nation Committee Meeting</p>
<p>(Paris) There will be three important international conferences in Geneva. The British, Belgian, and Italian governments have notified France that they have agreed to hold a meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact in Geneva to consider the "peace plan" described in Hitler's response to the four-power memorandum. The meeting will likely be held on Thursday. The staff headquarters of Britain, France, and Belgium will begin talks in London on Wednesday to discuss ways to deal with unprovoked aggression against France and Belgium. The 13-Nation Committee will also meet in Geneva on Wednesday to find a peaceful resolution to the East African war. (Reuters Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden to Go to Geneva Today</h3>
<p>Cabinet Decides on Attitude Toward Two Conferences</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a special meeting at noon today to discuss the task assigned to the 13-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations regarding the peace negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia, as well as the second meeting of the countries related to the Locarno Pact. Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow. (Havas News Agency Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to observations, British Foreign Secretary Eden will urge a ceasefire between Italy and Abyssinia before the 13-Nation Committee in Geneva begins direct peace talks with Italy. At the same time, it is reported that the British authorities have learned that the Italian army has used poison gas in Abyssinia and believe that the 13-Nation Committee must discuss this matter. Britain may present evidence of the Italian army's use of poison gas at the 13-Nation Committee meeting. Regarding Germany's counter-proposal to the four-power memorandum, the British authorities believe that informal talks between the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact would be more beneficial than a formal meeting. (Reuters Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Eden's proposal that the meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact should be held in Geneva at the convenience of the meeting of the 13-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations has been accepted by the French government. Recently, the Belgian government has also notified Foreign Minister Flandin that it has approved the British proposal. However, Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland will not be able to arrive in Geneva until the morning of the 9th of this month due to other matters. Therefore, the second meeting of the Locarno Pact will likely be held on that day. It is generally believed that when the time comes, Foreign Minister Flandin will demand that Britain, Belgium, and Italy fully implement the terms contained in the draft Locarno Agreement of March 19. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The second meeting of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact is scheduled to be held in Geneva in the middle of this week. Preliminary talks between Britain and France will be held here beforehand, on Monday and Tuesday. French Ambassador Corbin returned to the country a few days ago to attend the ambassadorial conference and has returned to his post tonight. He will pay a visit to Foreign Secretary Eden tomorrow to hold consultations on the French reply and the French government's views on the German peace plan. It is reported that the British government will do its best to reconcile the plans proposed by France and Germany. In addition, Britain and France will also exchange views on the issue of peace negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia and the working procedures of the 13-Nation Committee of the Council of the League of Nations. (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The responsible parties are unwilling to announce the date of the Anglo-Franco-Belgian staff talks. However, according to information gathered by this newspaper, the talks will begin in London on Wednesday (the 8th). (Havas Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Herriot Speaks on the International Situation</h3>
<p>French Plan Based on Collective Security; Time to Remedy the Defects of the League of Nations</p>
<p>Lyon The mayor of this city, former leader of the Radical Socialist Party Herriot, recently gave a speech on the international situation at a meeting here, stating that "The current system of the League of Nations does have shortcomings. It is time to remedy the defects. If we do not take action in time, I fear that we will miss the opportunity and regret it. Germany should enjoy equal rights, and we do not disagree with that. However, the obligations of implementing policies applicable to all countries should be equal. This is also what we seek. The international situation is extremely serious today. However, if we, the citizens of free countries with republican systems, also know how to unite as those authoritarian political systems boast of, then all the current difficulties can be overcome. The first important task that we should accomplish is to maintain the Locarno Pact. We do not object to Germany participating and working together. It is not impossible to complete this task, and a part of it has already been realized at this time. Regarding this point, the right-wing parties in our country often have dissatisfaction with Britain, which should be refuted. For example, Britain has also recently made loud calls for a collective security system. However, we do not know how to repay it. Even if there is no cold attitude expressed in words, at least we have this awareness. To repay kindness with ingratitude will naturally disappoint the British public. Therefore, for the current plan, all citizens, regardless of party affiliation, whether they are Republicans or Democrats, should work together to ensure that our same traditional concept, that is, the two concepts of freedom and integrity, can be maintained." Herriot then mentioned the peace plan that France intends to propose, saying that "This plan is based on collective security and is in direct opposition to the theory held by Germany, which is based on mutual non-aggression treaties. In the past, the Fifth General Assembly of the League of Nations passed the Geneva Protocol in 1924 based on France's proposal. When the Disarmament Conference was held in 1932, the current Minister without Portfolio, former Minister of War Peng Gu, proposed the security disarmament plan (November 4 of that year). Its profound meaning and legacy still remain. The current French plan is to re-adopt the spirit of these two plans. In addition, we have not forgotten our friendly countries, that is, the countries of the Little Entente. This is what all those countries should know." (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Did Not Mention Request to Recover Territories</h3>
<p>Baldwin Answers Member's Question</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin, in response to a member's question in the House of Commons today, stated that the government had not heard Germany raise any demands to reclaim former colonies. On February 12th, Colonial Secretary Thomas had said that the British government had not considered, nor did it wish to consider, handing over any British colonies, mandates, or protectorates to Germany. The British government maintains this attitude and has not changed it to this day. Conservative Party member Sandys asked the Prime Minister whether he could guarantee that the government would always maintain this policy. The Prime Minister replied that he had already answered this question and had nothing further to say. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Unwilling to Seek Peace or Fearing Difficulty and Abdicating - The Albanian Emperor Determined to Resist to the End - After the Fall of the Crucial Town of Kuc, Italian Military Strategy Advances Towards Tepelene</h3>
<p>(London) Albanian Minister Dr. Martin recently gave an interview to a reporter from the News Chronicle, saying, "It is true that the Albanian troops on the northern front are currently under pressure from the Italian army, but our military strength has not been damaged, and we are still capable of competing with the Italian army. His Majesty the Emperor has decided to fight to the end and will not hesitate to die in battle. In any case, he will never abdicate out of fear of difficulty." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Tirana. The Albanian Foreign Minister stated that the Italian reports claiming that the Albanian King only prayed after receiving telegrams were malicious propaganda by the Italian side. The Albanian government does not recognize the claim that the Albanian King intends to seek peace or abdicate. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Headquarters of the Italian Army on the Northern Front. After the Italian army occupied Kuc yesterday, they will probably soon be ordered to attack Tepelene. This place is guarded by the Albanian Emperor's Imperial Guard and is a crucial passage directly to the Albanian capital. The Italian army headquarters issued an official statement today, stating, "This victory has enabled the headquarters to design and implement extremely risky plans in a short period." It is interpreted that this means that the Italian army will attack Tepelene within a week. At the same time, Italian Army Commander General Badoglio announced, "No matter what methods the Albanian Emperor uses, the Italian army will definitely win." Badoglio firmly believes that the Albanian Emperor can no longer boost morale. During the Italian attack on Kuc, they used 64 tons of bombs and 20,000 rounds of machine-gun fire. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Albanian town of Kuc on the northern front has been occupied by the Italian army. The town is located eight kilometers south of Lake Ochrida, controlling the passage to Tepelene, and is only 150 kilometers away from that city. The recent troop movements in the northern front by Albania have all passed through this place. The roads going back and forth are all in good condition. Now that it has been occupied by the Italian army, it will inevitably be faster to advance along the original road than before. Therefore, semi-official sources said that the fall of Kuc is extremely significant. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Asmara. A communique issued here today stated that after the Italian army cleared out the remnants of the Albanian King's army near Kuc, they had completely occupied Kuc. At the same time, Italian aircraft are pursuing the main force of the Albanian army, which is fleeing south in disarray. Today, six Italian aircraft heavily bombed Tepelene, but the extent of the damage is unknown. During the major battle between the Italian and Albanian armies yesterday, Italian aircraft dropped 64 tons of bombs and fired tens of thousands of machine-gun bullets. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italian Use of Poison Gas Confirmed</h3>
<p>(London) The Albanian government has repeatedly telegraphed the League of Nations to protest the Italian army's use of poison gas. Various newspapers here have now received confirmation from Dr. Stephen, the director of the British field hospital stationed in Ethiopia, stating that among the Albanian wounded soldiers and civilians treated in his hospital, more than 3,000 people were faint from toxic gas attacks. More than sixty of them have lost their lives as a result. (National Society Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Albania Urges Britain to Provide Loans to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>(London) The Abyssinian Embassy in Britain recently issued a notice hoping that the British people will provide loans to Albania in a private capacity for the purchase of aircraft. The total amount of the loan is tentatively set at one million pounds. Minister Martin declared to the press that most countries implementing sanctions against aggressors in good faith are experiencing economic difficulties. After the loan is established, Albania will purchase aircraft from these countries, which may slightly alleviate the economic difficulties in the selling countries, while Albania can use the aircraft to drive out the enemy, truly achieving two goals with one action.

<h3>Italian Soldiers Continuously Transported to East Africa</h3>
<h3>Thirteen-Nation Committee to Put Pressure on Italy</h3>
<p>Urging a Truce in East Africa</p>
<p>European Peace Cannot Exclude Italy</p>
<p>French Foreign Ministry Organ Makes Indirect Statement</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Administrative Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee is scheduled to meet in Geneva this Wednesday to discuss the peace negotiations between Italy and Albania. According to the Daily News, the committee will attempt to exert significant mental pressure on Italy to accept the basic principles of the proposal put forward by the Administrative Council's Five-Nation Committee last September as the basis for resolving the Italian-Albanian dispute. "If Germany takes action against Austria, Italy will need to come to the aid of Austria, and its need for assistance from European countries will be extremely urgent. Italy is well aware of this fact. Therefore, it is possible that its attitude towards the Italian-Albanian dispute may shift." (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris. The French Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, "Le Temps," published an editorial today discussing the Italian-Albanian situation, briefly stating that due to the current development of the Italian-Albanian war, the position of the Albanian authorities is already extremely dangerous. There is no better way than to negotiate peace with Italy. As for Italy, most of its desires have been satisfied, and it is wise to open peace talks at this time. We now urgently hope for the end of the Italian-Albanian war, because the establishment of European peace cannot succeed without Italy's participation.</p>
<p>Generally, this is considered an indirect statement by the French authorities on the Italian-Albanian dispute. (National Society Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Since Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Treaty, the Italian-Albanian dispute has taken a back seat. Recently, due to the Italian army's continuous victories and the capture of important Albanian towns, the newspapers here have again paid attention to the Italian-Albanian dispute, writing articles of criticism. For example, the News Chronicle stated, "Now that the clamor for Germany to return to the League of Nations is rampant, but before Germany returns, there is an aggressor who thought it would not be difficult to bring it to justice, but the League of Nations has been unable to deal with it. The absolute incompetence of the League of Nations has been proven by facts. Then, even if Germany rejoins the League of Nations, what good will it do? Since the beginning of the Italian-Albanian dispute, the League of Nations has exhausted its wisdom and tried its best to prevent war. The main purpose is to prevent similar tactics to Italy's actions from occurring in the nearby European region. We believe that Italy should not be allowed to win, and that is why." The Daily Express stated, "The Italian-Albanian war will soon come to an end. France will naturally come forward to mediate, striving to bring the war to an end, because France urgently needs Italy's assistance to protect Austria's independence and prevent Germany's eastward expansion." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris. Excelsior recently reported that as the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council is about to convene, Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich previously invited the chairman of the committee, Madariaga, to visit Rome before the meeting to discuss everything with Prime Minister Mussolini. However, Madariaga refused, and there is no small amount of discord between the two. Therefore, the discussion at the meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee will definitely be tense. Furthermore, the report that Madariaga is supposed to read at the meeting of the committee (detailing the situation of his contact with representatives of Italy and Albania and attaching four letters exchanged with the Italian government) has been publicly released by the League of Nations Secretariat. The Italian newspapers immediately fiercely criticized the report, saying that it nitpicked the methods used by General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian expeditionary force, and did not hesitate to elaborate, but it mostly glossed over the atrocities of the Albanian army. It rarely mentions the possibility of peace negotiations between Italy and Albania, which is very inappropriate. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Britain Intensifies Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Navy Department Rushes to Create New Designs</p>
<p>(London) Daily News naval expert Plawright claims that naval architects are currently discussing new designs for two battleships, eight cruisers, and several destroyers and submarines.

It is expected that the construction of each new ship will begin in this fiscal year. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain - Chamberlain to Succeed Baldwin as Prime Minister - Unlikely to Happen Before the Coronation of the British Monarch</h3>
<p>(London) Government members of the House of Commons have received notices that when discussing the issue of equal pay for civil servants, regardless of gender, who hold equal positions, they must all attend and vote in favor. This is the result of the government's failure on Wednesday. Prime Minister Baldwin announced that the government had decided on the policy of equal pay and was not prepared to give it up. Therefore, he proposed a motion to support this, and regarded the vote in the House of Commons as a vote of confidence. Generally, it is expected that Baldwin will receive the support of the majority, but newspapers that support the opposition believe that last week's failure was a prelude to a government reshuffle. The Daily Mail expects a complete government reshuffle after Easter and said that Baldwin has decided to resign, to be replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored here that Prime Minister Baldwin will soon resign, be transferred to a ministerial position, or be reappointed as a Privy Councilor, which is also unknown. The Prime Minister's position will be filled by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and former Foreign Secretary Hoare will be appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In addition, Foreign Secretary Eden will be transferred to the position of Secretary of State for India. The vacant position of Foreign Secretary will be filled by either Lord Halifax, Lord Privy Seal, or Sir Horne, a member of the House of Commons. (Sir Horne previously served as Minister of Labour in January 1919, Minister of Commerce in March 1920, and Chancellor of the Exchequer in April 1921, resigning in October 1922.) According to the Daily Mail, the aforementioned cabinet changes are bound to happen, saying that Prime Minister Baldwin suffers from deafness, which has recently worsened, and he may find it difficult to continue representing the government in debates in the House of Commons. He will naturally have to resign. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the rumors that Prime Minister Baldwin is about to resign, political figures believe that although this is possible, if it is said that he will submit his resignation immediately after the proposed proposal for the Italian-Albanian dispute was aborted, the cabinet's position has already been weakened since last December. Some people even thought that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain should come forward to replace the Prime Minister, but this argument has subsided. Recently, Minister Without Portfolio Lord Runciman suddenly resigned, and the cabinet failed twice in the House of Lords last week, and the talk of a reshuffle arose again. If it does become a reality in the future, then former Foreign Secretary Hoare will hold an important position in the new cabinet, and incumbent Foreign Secretary Eden can still remain in his post. In short, regardless of the situation, King Edward VIII is scheduled to hold his coronation ceremony in May, and the cabinet will not be drastically reshuffled before then. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>French Naval Minister Explains - The Process of Concluding the Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>(Paris) Naval Minister Pietri recently gave an interview to a reporter from "L'Intransigeant," commenting on the naval treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States on March 25. He said, "According to this treaty, the tonnage of various types of ships has been clearly stipulated, and the signatory countries will not compete with each other in terms of tonnage and can be in an equal position. However, the naval needs of each signatory country can still be freely estimated and have not been restricted. The long-term constraints previously accepted by the French Navy (referring to the ratio system stipulated by the Washington Naval Treaty) have now been lifted. According to the Washington Naval Treaty, the strength stipulated for the French Navy was one-third of the British and American navies, or slightly more than one-half of the Japanese navy, and it was on par with the Italian navy. Although France was happy to accept the obligations of this treaty, it was limited to battleships, and it was unwilling to accept the same restriction method for various auxiliary ships at that time. Therefore, France refused to sign the 1930 London Naval Treaty in order to restore its strength before the European War. The newly concluded treaty has now canceled the ratio system stipulated by the Washington Naval Treaty. This is due to Japan's opposition, and France has also consistently refused to extend it. We have frankly stated this view to British First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell in July 1934 when Britain invited the relevant countries to hold preliminary naval conference talks. In short, our goal is to obtain freedom. Japan's purpose in withdrawing shortly after the opening of the naval conference is different from ours, not satisfied with obtaining freedom, but wants to require Britain and the United States to reduce their existing naval forces in order to realize equal rights, which Britain and the United States are unwilling to do and therefore resolutely rejected. Pietri then said that although Japan and Italy both refused to participate in the new naval treaty, their views are completely different. It is currently impossible to know what attitude Japan will adopt in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate protective clauses in the new naval treaty (these clauses stipulate that if the shipbuilding programs of non-signatory countries exceed the provisions of the naval treaty, the signatory countries can restore their freedom). As for Italy, its views on the new naval treaty are the same as those of Britain, France, and the United States. The reason why it refuses to sign is purely due to political factors. Italy has expressed approval of the new naval treaty in general and has never opposed it. There is no doubt that it will be able to respect it in the future. As for Germany, although it is not a signatory to the new naval treaty, if its shipbuilding program exceeds the provisions in the future, the protective clauses should be implemented. I think it is appropriate for Germany to participate in the new naval treaty. Germany should do so, and so should Soviet Russia, because the Soviet Navy has not accepted any restrictive measures to date. Regarding this level, the relevant countries have not yet determined what procedures should be adopted. Previously, when the naval conference was held, the British representative originally advocated inviting Germany and Russia to attend and participate. At that time, the French representative believed that the naval conference should only be attended by representatives of the signatory countries to the Washington Naval Treaty, and he rejected the British proposal. France proposed two methods: 1. The signatory countries to the Washington Naval Treaty should first establish a treaty; 2. Then, other countries should sign and participate, hoping to establish a general agreement. General negotiations could have started at that time, but because the United States did not feel interested in this, it advocated that the signatory countries to the Washington Naval Treaty should continue negotiations in order to speed up the naval conference. Therefore, the new treaty was only signed by Britain, the United States, and France, and Britain conducted separate negotiations with other countries to complete a general agreement. But I don't know whether the current international situation will facilitate the implementation of this plan. As for the mutual notification of shipbuilding programs, what France advocates is that "although countries can build ships freely, they must clearly announce it." The French political system is parliamentary, and any secret action is not allowed. What is worrying is that other countries deliberately play tricks or even adopt lightning-fast means. In addition, the various qualitative restrictions stipulated in the new naval treaty do not hinder French naval policy. (Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>Plans to Request an Appropriation of 1 Billion Yen - General Minami Jiro Visits the Emperor to Report on the Military Situation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, border disputes between Russia, Manchukuo, and Mongolia have occurred frequently. The military department cited the following as the main reasons: 1. The border line is unclear; 2. The Soviet Far East forces have recently been rapidly strengthened. Therefore, there is a wide gap between our military strength, and the balance of military strength is a prerequisite for solving the problem. Therefore, it has reached the conclusion that it is an urgent matter to strengthen the troops in Manchuria. It is currently planned to realize this from this fiscal year, with a continuing project of 900 million yen over five years, and another 100 million yen for special facilities, totaling 1 billion yen.

Those who advocate for the devaluation of the franc are extremely unwise. Devaluation policies may be beneficial if they are implemented during a period of global currency stability. However, at this time, the British pound and the US dollar are not stable. Those who attack our currency can use the same means against the currencies of Britain and the United States. If so, once the French franc is devalued, the British pound and the US dollar will also fall at the same time. Then, the devaluation of the French franc will not only be useless, but will also cause internal disturbances and lead to disputes." Herriot briefly described the domestic political situation, saying that the leaders of all parties have united in good faith, and the members of each party should also follow suit and unite as one.

<h3>Motor Vessel Tricolor Suffers Mishap. Passengers Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>San Francisco. The Norwegian motor vessel Tricolor (6,850 tons) was en route from Manila via Hong Kong, Shanghai, and various Japanese ports to San Francisco when it suffered a mishap about a thousand miles from Yokohama. All passengers on board were safely transferred to an American vessel, including two American women who boarded in Shanghai. The Tricolor belongs to the Wilhelmsen Barber Steamship Company, and Tientsin Yang Hing is its agent in Shanghai. There were a total of sixteen passengers on board, with forty crew members, including six women and five children. Seven of them boarded in Manila, and the remaining four boarded in Hong Kong. After the ship's mishap, it sent out a distress signal, which was received by several ships. The closest one was the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company's oil tanker Yarrowdale (8,627 tons), which was en route from Dalian to California. The two ships communicated by radio and sailed towards each other at full speed. Initially, due to the darkness of the night and rough seas, the passengers could not be transferred, but eventually all were rescued. Relatives of the Manila passengers were initially worried upon hearing the news of the ship's mishap. Last night, an American resident received a telegram from his mother on board, stating that everyone was safe, which greatly comforted everyone. According to the Yarrowdale's report, the Tricolor is now trying to run aground on a shoal in Honolulu or Yokohama. The fire on board is still dangerous, but it has not spread.

<h3>Present State of Shenyang Industry Due to Japanese Initiative: Once the Origin of the Incident, Now a Japanese Industrial Zone</h3>
<p>Shenyang, the origin of the September 18th Incident, has now become a Japanese industrial zone. Various light and heavy industries such as enamel, iron, hardware, wool weaving, hemp manufacturing, winemaking, tobacco, and soy sauce brewing are all available. The active initiative of the Japanese is evident. The various industrial conditions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tobacco: The sales volume (quantity) of the Dongya Tobacco Shenyang Factory increased by 15% last month. Compared to the same period last year, it has almost increased by 40%. Also, due to the implementation of taxation by the puppet organization, the Dongya Tobacco "Golden Gun" brand required in Shenyang, concerning tax matters, prior contracts were made and many were concluded.</p>
<p>Hardware: This year, companies worried about overproduction from last year and restricted production. Overall, sales this year can be considered good. The Shenyang hardware industry had a stock of 8 million yuan in March, all of which were absorbed. Approximately 15 million pieces were contracted with the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) and others. "Manzhou" hardware has already contracted half of its six-month production. The market price is 9 rin.</p>
<p>Hemp Manufacturing: The production volume of Shenyang hemp manufacturing is not much different from the previous month, about 500,000 pieces. The company's factory in the Yingkou affiliated area is full of products. Most of the factory's products are transported to North Manchuria.</p>
<p>Wool Weaving: The production volume of Man-Mongol wool weaving is unchanged from the previous month, reaching 100,000 (270,000) pieces. Sales volume is approximately 330,000 yuan, an increase of 20% from the previous month. The puppet public office has approved 30% fewer new batches for the new year, but there is a large demand for wool fabrics from civilians, and sales in Shanghai and North China are gradually becoming active. Currently, the shipping of Western-style clothing fabrics to North Manchuria in April is not active, but it is better than before. The market price is weak at 24 sen and 2 rin.</p>
<p>Ironworks: The Dalian Machinery Shenyang Factory has no new contracts, and the production volume is 2 million. It is spending its time in a leisurely manner. Due to the ice-free period for Japanese "Man" steel materials, handling in March was already active.</p>
<p>Brewing: All factories producing sake, soy sauce, and sorghum liquor are ordinary. (Tohoku News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Court: Second Trial Regarding the Wang Jingwei Assassination Case: Only Testimony Regarding the Events from Witnesses from Nanjing; Wang Yaqiao Boasts Himself as the "King of Assassins"</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. After the Hong Kong government arrested Yu Likui (also known as Li Zi'an and Li Shiru), Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and Zhang Zhihan, the key suspects in the Wang Jingwei assassination case, the Nanjing government sent a letter to Hong Kong requesting their extradition for prosecution. The case was officially heard by Judge Shi of the Central Tribunal on the 30th, and a continued hearing was held at 2:30 p.m. on the 1st. After the court was convened, Li Zhizheng, the deputy investigator of the Nanjing Police Department, was first called to the witness stand. He testified, "Hu Yunqing was the president of the Nanjing Chenguang News Agency, also known as Hua Kezhi. He Po Guang was the editor of the agency, located at 2 Huanghelou Street, Nanjing. When I searched the agency, I found completed printed manuscripts. I also discovered a letter, which is currently kept by the Nanjing Police Department. The letter stated that the assassination of Wang Jingwei was our doing and had nothing to do with Guo Yongmou. The letter was addressed to the gentlemen for their perusal. In addition, there was a pile of scrap paper with printed text, resembling a news draft, stating that Wang Jingwei had been assassinated. Zhang Yuhua was arrested in Shanghai on November 16th. He Po Guang was arrested in Zhenjiang on November 3rd last year. Gu Zifeng and his wife, as well as Sun Fengming's wife, were also arrested at the same time. All those arrested gave confessions. According to Nanjing's publication regulations, all news agencies must register their address and staff. The registration date for Chenguang News Agency was September 26, 1934. The applicant for registration was Hu Yunqing, the address was 2 Huanghelou Street, and the registered editor was He Po Guang. There were a total of four registered reporters, including the deceased Sun Fengming."</p>
<p>At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Xi Bingxi, stood up to question him. Li replied, "I saw Sun Fengming at the Central Hospital. Sun's injuries were also very severe. He was suffering from gunshot wounds. He was more conscious than Wang at the time. The ward was not full of visitors. Besides myself, there were two other people, and there were two police officers guarding outside the room. Although the assassination case was serious, I was ordered to investigate the matter and therefore had the right to handle it. I visited Sun Yiming for half an hour. Sun died at midnight on November 2nd. Before the assassination occurred, I had never met Sun Fengming. After the incident, I was ordered to search the agency. By then, everyone in the agency had already fled. The situation inside the agency was extremely chaotic. I searched everywhere and only found a large pile of ashes in the kitchen. There were very few documents in the agency. There were also remnants of burned paper in the pile of ashes, stating that Wang Jingwei had been assassinated."</p>
<p>After Li Zhi finished testifying, the judge ordered him to sign the deposition and step down. Next, Wang Renshan (also known as Wang Baishi), another witness from the Nanjing government, testified. He stated, "I was born in Qiongzhou. At the age of seven, I entered elementary school in Guangzhou. At that time, my father worked in Chinese politics. In 1921, at the age of fifteen, I transferred to Nanjing to study. After graduating from middle school, I transferred to Peking University. In 1928, at the age of 23, I dropped out of school and worked at the Nanjing Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters for about three or four months. Later, I returned to Guangzhou and worked at the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang. Since 1930, I have been unemployed and have resided in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. All expenses were provided by my father, who was the secretary of the Qiongyai Chamber of Commerce. I also returned to my hometown of Qiongyai. In 1923, when I was seventeen, I met Wang Yaqiao in Shanghai. I became friends with him. At that time, he was unemployed at home. Later, when I worked in Nanjing, I often met with him. I also knew Chen Huixi. In Hong Kong, he led me to Wang Yaqiao's house on Wanzai Road. Wang's friend was named Mai Kongzhang. In 1934, I met the first defendant, Yu Likui. I also visited Wang Yaqiao. At that time, Yu Likui was also known as Li Zi'an and lived in a building on Yongxing Street. I visited him according to the address. Our relationship was quite harmonious. At that time, Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui, etc., had no legitimate occupation. Wang Yaqiao trusted me very much. He often boasted to me that he was a 'King of Assassins' and had single-handedly carried out many assassination cases in Shanghai. Even the first defendant, Yu Likui, had heard him boast in this way. He also said that his most proud 'masterpiece' was the assassination attempt on Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station in Shanghai, because he was able to carry out the assassination under the noses of the military police and get away safely, which was why he was so proud of himself. At that time, they were planning the assassination in Hong Kong. I heard that someone had offered a large reward for the assassination of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, but I do not know who offered the reward. At that time, the defendants Zhou Shiping and Hu Dahai lived with Yu Likui and resided in a building on Yongxing Street. When Wang Yaqiao talked to me about the assassination of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, the defendants Zhou Shiping and Hu Dahai were present. I met Hua Kezhi in July 1934 at Wang Yaqiao's house in Wanzai. He was staying at Wang Yaqiao's house. After Hua arrived in Hong Kong, he held several meetings. Those present included Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and myself. The content of the discussions was about carrying out the assassination of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. It was decided to establish a news agency in Nanjing. This proposal was put forward by Wang Yaqiao. The name of the agency was Chenguang, and Zhang Yuhua was appointed as the general manager. Zhang was a former subordinate of Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui. He Po Guang was appointed as the editor-in-chief, Gu Zifeng was appointed as the general affairs, and Sun Fengming, Liu Shurong, and others were appointed as reporters. The purpose of setting up the news agency was nothing more than to take advantage of the superior position of news reporters, who could approach general party and government officials and seize opportunities to act. At that time, they advocated appointing Sun Fengming as a reporter and also recommended the third defendant, Hu Dahai. When Hu heard this, he expressed his willingness to go. As for the agency's source of funding and the monthly allowance, I do not know anything about it. After this matter was decided, Hua Kezhi left Hong Kong in July and returned to Hong Kong once in September," and so on. By this point, it was already past 5 o'clock, and the judge ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody and await further trial at a later date. It is reported that in addition to sending several police officers and witnesses to Hong Kong to testify, Nanjing is now sending another seven or eight witnesses to Hong Kong to testify. These seven or eight people will arrive in Hong Kong successively during the day. This reporter visited Xi Bingxi, the defense lawyer for the defendants in this case, to inquire about the handling of the case. According to him, the Nanjing side attaches great importance to this case, and the case has become serious. Therefore, it will take three to several months to conclude the case. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea: Establishment of a Transportation and Sales Committee, Active Improvement of Transportation and Sales Methods, and Encouragement of Tea Firms to Manufacture Tea</h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee held its inaugural meeting in Anqing on April 1st. The Agricultural Department of the National Economic Council, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and both the Finance and Construction Departments sent representatives to attend. Yang Mianzhong, Director of the Anhui Provincial Finance Department, Liu Yiyan, Director of the Construction Department, as well as tea industry experts and bank representatives, also attended. The meeting lasted for three days, and resolved to organize general and branch transportation and sales offices, unify transportation and sales, raise funds to loan to tea firms, and improve tea manufacturing, among other important matters. Upon visiting the committee, Permanent Committee Member and Director of the Anhui Provincial Construction Department, Liu Yiyan, provided the following detailed information:</p>
<p>"The black teas of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces are traditionally divided into three types: Qihong, Ninghong, and Hehong. Qihong is produced in Qimen, Zhide in Anhui, and Fuliang in Jiangxi, three counties; Ninghong is produced in Xiushui, Tonggu, and Wuning in Jiangxi, three counties; and Hehong is produced in Qianshan and other counties in Jiangxi. They have long enjoyed a high reputation in the international market, with annual exports reaching over 500,000 cases at their peak. In recent years, the situation has steadily declined. Qihong's annual production is now 60,000 cases, Ninghong only 10,000 cases, and Hehong has completely disappeared. The reasons for this are partly due to the rise of teas from India, Ceylon, Java, and Japan, which have seized our markets. However, it is also due to the weak financial resources and lack of organization of tea farmers and tea firms, which allows intermediate merchants to manipulate and exploit them, leading to a complete collapse. The prominent drawbacks include increased costs, susceptibility to unexpected losses, confusion of product prices, and the instigation of speculation. Anhui Province originally had a tea improvement farm in Qimen, which was jointly operated with the Industrial Department of the National Economic Council two years ago, increasing funding and fully equipping it to improve planting and manufacturing. In February of this year, the National Economic Council convened a tea technology discussion meeting. The Anhui Construction Department proposed the establishment of a Qihong Transportation and Sales Committee to use tea firms' loan proceeds to collect tea to benefit the specialty product. This was approved in principle. After the meeting, the Anhui Provincial Government sent personnel to consult with Jiangxi Province and obtained their agreement to expand the scope of assistance to include both Qihong and Ninghong, organizing the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee. Now that the committee has been established, the implementation measures are as follows: After registering tea firms, loans will be processed. Whether providing direct loans or introducing loans, efforts will be made to reduce interest rates. In terms of transportation, the highways and railways of both provinces will be used to reduce freight costs and ensure fast and safe transportation. In terms of sales, experts from China and abroad will be invited to evaluate the prices, so that consumers are not deceived and producers are not oppressed. The committee's transportation and sales office will only charge a commission of 2%, without any other fees. A transportation and sales branch will also be established in London. This year's efforts started late and will only focus on preliminary improvements in transportation and sales. In the future, detailed registration methods will also be stipulated for tea firm tea manufacturing, and further benefits will be sought for tea farmers. After the establishment of the committee's transportation and sales office, tea stack talents will be recruited as much as possible to assist. If there are debt relationships, there will also be handling methods. As for tea firms that do not borrow from the committee this year, if their tea is transported and sold by the committee, the tea price obtained after selling all the tea products will be handed over to the original lender after deducting commissions and advances to settle accounts with the tea firm. If the original lender voluntarily recovers the loan, before the products are shipped, the committee may review the qualifications of the tea firm, confirm that it meets the committee's prescribed loan amount, and transfer the loan and interest after verification, so there is no impact on the debts of the tea stacks."

<h3>Suzhou: Zhang Yipeng Requests Commissioner Zang to Pay Attention to Three Matters</h3>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the Wuxi District, arrived in Suzhou by car from Shanxi at around 6 PM on the 5th, accompanied by Section Chief Cui Bofu and Xu Jicheng, a strategist from the District Security Command. That evening, Zang visited Zhu Shusheng, the President of the Jiangsu High Court. At 9 AM on the 6th, he convened officials from various agencies and village leaders and patrol officers in Zhongshan Hall for a "Grand Joint Memorial Week" event, attended by five to six hundred people. The event began with a report by Chairman Sun Danchen, followed by a speech from Commissioner Zang, which covered four points: how to cope with the difficulties China is facing, the direction of the central government's efforts, the working goals of local governments, and matters requiring special attention from individuals. Subsequently, Zhang Yipeng, the Director of the Relief Institute, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the people of Wuxian, and expressed three points for Commissioner Zang to pay attention to: Security issues: At present, bandits are rampant in the four rural areas, and villagers with some wealth are moving to cities. Relief efforts should be strengthened to provide the unemployed in the area with a place to settle, strictly prohibit opening halls to recruit disciples, and eliminate local bullies to cut off the source of bandits. Economic issues: It is necessary to provide relief to farmers, industrialists, and merchants, especially paying attention to farmers. Prohibition of opium: Wuxian has a large population, so there are many opium addicts. The government should be lenient and provide them with ways to quit and start anew, but due to limited funding, opium cessation centers cannot accommodate all addicts, and the fee system has been abolished, leaving those without money unable to quit. There are currently over two thousand opium addicts waiting to quit, and six hundred in cessation centers, so more funds should be raised to benefit opium addicts. The meeting then adjourned. In the afternoon, Commissioner Zang inspected various agencies such as the County Government, Education Bureau, Construction Bureau, and Public Security Bureau. That evening at 7 PM, he was scheduled to convene an administrative meeting at the County Government to discuss everything. He is scheduled to leave Suzhou for the provincial capital this morning.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Requests a Ban on Purchasing Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Grain Industry Guild, upon hearing reports of the authorities planning to purchase foreign rice, specifically submitted a petition to the Provincial Government's Ministry of Internal Affairs on the 5th, stating that China's rice harvest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces last year was not poor, and there are sufficient grain reserves. In the autumn of foreign goods dumping, foreign rice should not be allowed to be dumped again. They requested a ban on this.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Scheduled Inspection of All County Inns</h3>
<p>The Kunshan Public Security Bureau has organized vocational training courses. Inns, bathhouses, and barber shops throughout the county have completed their training. The bureau has scheduled inspections for inns from April 5th to 10th, bathhouses from April 11th to 14th, and barber shops from April 15th to 25th. The inspection results will be reported to the bureau for rewards and punishments.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Lake Bandits Plan to Disturb Local Areas, Alert</h3>
<p>Recently, a large gang of bandits in Zhejiang, allied with lake bandits, totaling over two hundred people, gathered in Taihu Lake, plotting to disturb the area. They plan to land at Wutangmen, Renzigang, and Southern Spring Town in the Wuxi area along the lake to loot. After receiving the warning, County Magistrate Long immediately reported it to the Sixth Brigade of the Provincial Security Force stationed in Wuxi, which promptly dispatched two companies, hiring steamers and civilian boats to be ready at the Gongyun Bridge. After 10 PM, the County Government received a telegram from Southern Spring, stating that the bandit crowd had left the town and was approaching. Gunfire could be faintly heard, requesting prompt dispatch of a team to the countryside for protection. Battalion Commander Zheng, accompanied by Adjutant Wu Junsen and Quartermaster Ma Xianrong, led the team to the countryside. The County Public Security Bureau also dispatched the County Water Patrol Team to the countryside to assist in the suppression. It is also reported that this group of bandits is carrying sixty-nine rifles and four machine guns, having fled into Taihu Lake and Dongting Mountain Lake from Jiaxing and other counties. Yunyan Bridge, the border between Wuxi and Wujin, has also received an alert, and counties along the lake are under strict guard.</p>
<h3>Eight County Police Teams Inspected in Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Spring Grand Inspection of the Second District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water and Land Public Security Police Team will be held in Wuxi tomorrow (the 8th). Yu Jingtang, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, will personally come to Wuxi to conduct the inspection. The participating troops include the police from Wuxian, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, Wujiang, Taicang, Kunshan, and the Second District Water Police, with a total of 991 soldiers. The Wuxi County Public Security Bureau has arranged Huangnidun City God Temple, Houqijie Great King Temple, Huishan Ancestral Temple, Yanggong Temple, Zhonglie Temple, and Lihuazhuang Yansheng Hall as lodging locations in advance. The chief officers of each inspected troop, such as Zhang from Wuxian, Zhou Ding from Changshu, Xu Shiguang from Wujin, Zhang Ruijing from Jiangyin, and Zhou Weilie from the Water Police District, have arrived in Wuxi. The firearms of the inspected water police officers have also been transported to Wuxi by the Jingping and Zhaowu warships.</p>
<h3>Panic Over Excess Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Various industries in Wuxi, such as tobacco, alcohol, soy sauce, rickshaws, meat, local products, and candles, are concerned that the market price of copper coins cannot follow the standard set by the Ministry, often hovering around 3,100 coins. The cost of exchange is increasing daily, so they have repeatedly requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward letters to the County Government and the Qianye Guild, requiring them to follow the standard set by the Ministry and use 3,000 coins as the opening price. The County Government has also issued a public notice on record. Subsequently, the Qianye Guild stated that the market price of copper coins fluctuates based on the amount in circulation, which will be limited by requiring the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to uniformly exchange copper coins according to the limited price. The guild resolved that after April [blank] the Qianye Guild will no longer buy or sell copper coins, nor will it discuss exchange rates. Since the market price was limited to 3,000, the amount of copper coins in circulation has greatly increased, but there is nowhere to spend them, causing great panic among various industries. They have successively reported to the Chamber of Commerce, inviting various industries, banks, Qianye Guild, and the County Government to discuss a proper solution to maintain the market.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Arrest of Robbers and Recovery of Stolen Goods in a Rural Robbery Case</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau dispatched detectives such as Chen Jichun to cooperate with county [blank] to arrest Chen [blank], a suspect in the robbery case of Gu Fuyou and Zhao Laoer in the Ninth District. He confessed to having multiple accomplices and revealed the location where the kidnapped victims were hidden. Detective Chen [blank] immediately obtained approval from County Magistrate Hou and dispatched eight detectives, including Zhang [blank] to [blank] County, where they cooperated with the county government to search Xinhai, Shetou, and other places. The bandits had fled, so they hired boats to pursue them. Finally, on the [blank] day, they encountered the bandits in Zhili Bridge. The two sides exchanged fire for about ten minutes before the bandits fled, throwing a box gun into the river. They then captured the bandits Xu Xiaogou, Yang Xiaoxi, Wang Ligong, Zhou Xiaomao, and Yang Along, as well as a large amount of stolen goods such as the boatman and boat woman, box guns, and bullets. They were immediately escorted to the Jintan County Government for detention. The ringleader, Xu Xiaogou, was brought back on the 9th for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Investigation and Study of Yangtze River Commerce</h3>
<p>After Zhenjiang Customs established a branch station in Cheng two years ago, it has now been converted into an upper and lower passenger and cargo station. In order to prosper the commercial market, the County Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to order China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianglun to call at Cheng, which was implemented for the first time on the 4th for a six-month trial period. Wu Jianying, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, also convened a meeting of industry leaders to organize an investigation and study group to visit major ports along the Yangtze River for on-the-spot negotiations. At the same time, they are raising shares to build cargo warehouses along the river, and have sent letters to the chambers of commerce of Wuxi and other counties, informing various industries that if there are goods coming from or going to Sichuan and Hubei, please arrange for them to be loaded and unloaded in Cheng to save on freight. It is necessary for the Chamber of Commerce to discuss setting up a branch office of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company based on the simultaneous progress of the upper and lower chambers of commerce in Jiangyin. During the trial period, the dock will be temporarily borrowed from Kai [blank], which has been negotiated.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Telephone Charges to Be Collected by Call</h3>
<p>The telephone service in the county is a commercial company, founded in 1913 with a capital of 180,000 yuan. However, due to having only 4850 subscribers, it has suffered significant losses for many years. Excluding expenses, the official interest is not enough to cover the debts. Now, in order to make up for the losses, the company plans to collect charges by call, similar to Shanghai. However, it is feared that users will object, so it will seek the consent of the majority of users, or increase the monthly fee. Which option will be implemented will be decided soon.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Water and Land Police Teams Gather for Inspection</h3>
<p>The public security police of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, Chongming, and Jingjiang in the Nantong area, as well as the Third District Water Public Security Team of Jiangsu, are scheduled to gather at Xiaoying in the west of Nantong City on the 15th of this month, where they will be inspected by Ge Tan, the commander of the district security forces. The Department of Civil Affairs will not send any additional members, and Zhu Aizhou has been designated as the commander.</p>

All documents and belongings were transported to Gaoyou on the 5th.</p>
<h3>Zhenyang Company Increases Capital</h3>

The method is to add one share for every five shares, totaling 64,000 yuan, with 16,000 yuan still needed. In addition, the previous addition of 18,418.5 yuan is planned to be distributed among the shareholders. If the amount is insufficient, the directors will subscribe the full amount.</p>
<h3>Construction Department Member Urges Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>The Construction Department believes that the Canal Engineering Bureau's Huaihe River, and all water conservancy projects in Jiangdu County, need to be expedited. Yesterday (the 4th), it specially sent member Zhou Ke[blank] to Yangzhou to specifically urge the handling of water conservancy, and approved the expenditure of the engineering funds required for water conservancy from the 45,000 yuan of provincial allocation for engineering relief from last year.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Overnight Fire on Yuntai Mountain</h3>

Yesterday evening (the 3rd) at about 7 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the forest near Zhangdao Temple on the northern foot of the mountain. The north wind was strong, and the fire spread across the mountainside, illuminating dozens of miles. Nearby residents suspected a bandit alarm, and all the blockhouses fired guns and cannons to warn, with no one daring to go out. The fire was not extinguished until about 10 AM the next morning. According to investigations, the fire area was over a hundred hectares, and the number of burnt trees is countless, estimated to be worth over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang: Huaiyin District County Magistrate Meeting</h3>

Yesterday, the government specifically issued inspection certificates and instructed the Public Security Bureau and the Fourth Security Company to strictly follow the specified methods for inspection, in order to prevent petty thieves and other illegal elements from [blank] among them and causing accidents.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Wu Tingyang Arrived in Hangzhou from Guangxi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Tingyang, the newly appointed Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, returned to his native Guangxi last month to handle mourning affairs due to the death of his mother. Now that the affairs have been completed, he was urged by Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong and arrived in Guangzhou from Guangxi on the 4th. On the morning of the 5th, he took a flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai. The Construction Department sent Secretary Lu Xicheng to welcome him. Wu rested in Shanghai for a day, and yesterday (the 6th) at 12:30 PM, he arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai and immediately went to the Provincial Government to visit Huang Shaohong. It is reported that he is scheduled to take office on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Nanping Section Works Team to Gan</h3>
<p>The Nanping Section Engineering Office of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with the commencement of the subordinate [blank] engineering divisions, is experiencing extremely tense engineering aspects. Wu Xiangqi, the director of the office, went to Shanghai to negotiate the purchase of materials. After finishing official business, he came to Hangzhou and decided to send Shi Yi, the director of the works team, to lead several engineers to Nanchang Zhangshuzhen tomorrow in order to supervise and direct everything.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Jiahu Highway to Open This Month</h3>
<p>Preparations for the construction of the Jiahu Highway (i.e., Jiaxing to Huzhou) have been underway for more than a year. However, construction was once suspended due to funding issues. It was only through the planning of Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong that construction was able to continue. It is expected that the project will be completed this month. It is also reported that Chen Qinshi, a gentleman from Wuxing, has leased the [blank] business of the road from the provincial highway authorities and has agreed on a method, with a rent of 300,000 yuan and a lease term of 20 years. The contract will be signed soon, and the road can be opened to traffic after completion this month.</p>
<h3>Pinghu: Impersonating a Military Officer, a Huge Sum Arrested</h3>
<p>Recently, silk shops in the city have been paying attention to displays, trying their best to attract customers. A few days ago, a man claiming to be a military officer arrived in Pinghu with his family and resided in the Tongan Hotel. They were all wearing military uniforms [blank] and went out at night, talking and laughing without restraint. The day before yesterday, the silk shops discovered that materials had been stolen and suspected the guests. Because the guests were selecting in the silk shops but did not make a transaction, they reported to the Public Security Branch, which searched the hotel and found all the stolen [blank]. The military officer took the opportunity to escape, and the other four were escorted to the County Government. After clear interrogation, they were detained separately. A silk shop in Jiaxing also lost two large [blank] of silk in the same way. Today, they sent someone to Pinghu to identify the items and have been recognized. The County Government approved the return of the items. The man impersonating a military officer is still at large.</p>
<h3>Opium Trafficker Arrested and Escorted to Su</h3>
<p>Opium trafficker [blank] Chanqiu from outside the East Gate smuggled thirty-five packages of opium from Shanghai the day before yesterday, hiding them in biscuit tins and taking a ship back to Ping. For some unknown reason, he suddenly quarreled with the purser, who ordered the ship to return to customs and reported it to the authorities. He was immediately arrested and, according to reports, escorted to Zhenjiang for military trial.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Ministry of Finance Maintains Huai Salt Rotation System</h3>
<p>Bengbu is a sales port for Huai salt. All salt transported from northern Anhui must be stored in warehouses and sold in rotation, which is the so-called rotation sales system. This system was approved by the Ministry of Finance in 1932 and has been in place for over three years. As it has been implemented for a long time, the accumulated salt is increasing daily, the organization is deficient, and the cost is naturally heavy. The price of salt has risen invisibly, and the burden on consumers has increased. Salt merchants such as Xiang Jinwen believe that northern Anhui is a free sales area, and selling salt in rotation is close to monopoly, which violates the principle of free sales. In recent months, they have repeatedly requested the authorities to abolish the rotation system, but have not been approved. Furthermore, northern Anhui has recently recruited merchants to transport a large amount of stored [blank] and plans to ship [blank] sales, so they submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance, requesting reconsideration. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has responded clearly, stating in substance that the [blank] transport from Anhui and Henan must still maintain the Bengbu rotation sales method in order to emphasize tax sales. The Bengbu [blank] price has been instructed by the Ministry to the Huaihe [blank] Transport Envoy to order the Bengbu Tax Collection Office to carefully review it, so as to achieve fairness. The Ministry's order to various regions to increase the transport of stored [blank] was originally to adjust supply and demand. Since transport merchants [blank] paid a large amount of taxes, it is inevitable that they must give appropriate treatment to this new tax [blank] in order to [blank] consider. From the above three points, it is difficult to abolish the Bengbu Huai [blank] rotation sales system for the time being.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Silkworm Farmers All Feed Improved Species</h3>
<p>The Xiaoshan Improved Sericulture Model Area, in order to improve [blank] industry production, yesterday specifically issued a public notice stating that all silkworm farmers must raise improved species. All Yuhang local species, [blank] county local species, silkworm farmers' self-retained local species, and inferior species not distributed in the district have been repeatedly banned by the county. As the sericulture season begins, it is inevitable that merchants seeking profit will come to the district to sell local species. They have ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and prohibit it, and all silkworm farmers should be aware of this. If there is a sale of local species or other inferior species, once discovered, they will be punished without leniency.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Meets with the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Work of the National Economic Council This Year: China's Successful Stabilization of Foreign Exchange Reported; Central Bank Deposits Increased to Over 700 Million</p>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, received newspaper reporters at the Bank of China at 11:00 AM on the 6th and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>National Economic Council – This Year's Work</p>
<p>According to Mr. Song, the National Economic Council will convene a regular meeting in Beijing at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to report on the general situation of this year's work and to determine the work plan for next year. The Northwest transportation network has been completed this year. The highways from Sichuan to Shaanxi and Gansu have been opened to traffic one after another. This year's health work will focus on Yunnan. Recently, Chairman Chen of Fujian Province also sent a letter requesting the dispatch of personnel to assist in carrying out all tasks. As for water conservancy work, it is handled by the National Water Conservancy Commission, which is presided over by Finance Minister Kong. The main task this year is to block the breaches of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>China Adopts Foreign Exchange Standard</p>
<p>Regarding China's currency system, it has in fact abandoned the silver standard and implemented the foreign exchange standard. The stabilization of foreign exchange has now been successfully achieved. The foreign exchange situation on November 4 remains maintained to this day. The US dollar, shilling, and Japanese gold have not changed much. Therefore, China's foreign exchange does not have a special inclination towards the US dollar, shilling, or Japanese gold. As for whether there will be major changes in the future, we will decide on China's inclination again.</p>
<p>Bank of China Deposits Increase Sharply</p>
<p>The Bank of China was originally government-run, but later became a commercial bank with the addition of a huge amount of commercial shares. Last year, the government increased its official shares, and some people suspected that the Bank of China's deposits would decrease thereafter. But in fact, after the Bank of China increased its official shares, its deposits increased sharply. Last year, deposits totaled more than 766 million yuan, an increase of more than 219 million yuan compared with the previous year, which is the highest record for the Bank of China's deposits. From this, it can be seen that the people's belief in the Bank of China can actually represent the people's belief in the government, which is very different from the past. At the same time, the government's responsibility has also increased. After the government and commerce become one, the government's power is indeed greater, but the responsibility is also heavier. Also, among the Bank of China's deposits last year, there were deposits from various commercial banks, totaling more than 90 million yuan, because all industries were depressed last year and all banks did not dare to make loans.</p>
<p>The Three Banks Issue More Paper Money</p>
<p>The issuance of paper money by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications continues to increase. Previously, the paper money issued by the three banks totaled 700 million yuan, but now it has increased by 120 million yuan. There are three reasons for this: the issuance of paper money by commercial banks has decreased, this is one; people exchange silver for legal tender, this is two; and foreign banks, except for Japanese banks, exchange silver for legal tender, this is three. However, although the issuance of paper money has increased, the reserves are sufficient, so the people's belief is very good. In the future, it will gradually increase as needed. Regarding the storage of silver among the people, there are currently no statistics. Most of the silver in Hebei Province has flowed out, while the storage of silver among the people in Shandong and Henan provinces is still large. As for the Ministry of Finance exchanging 50 million ounces of silver for gold and depositing it in the United States, it is for foreign exchange purposes, because gold can be moved at any time and can be used to purchase any foreign exchange, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Bank of China Plans to Establish Overseas Branches</p>
<p>Various commercial banks plan to implement a joint system. I have only heard of this and do not know the details. According to my observation of various commercial banks, if they implement a joint system, their strength will increase, which should be better than being separate. However, there are many ways to join forces, such as joint reserves, which is one of them. As for the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, they will still be separate. The Central Bank is being reorganized into a reserve bank, and preparations are still actively underway. I have not heard when it will be established. In addition to its existing branch in London, the Bank of China is currently planning to establish branches in New York, Singapore, San Francisco, Java, and Annam to facilitate remittances. I originally planned to go to various places to inspect the branches, but I was unable to set off due to the currency reform. "Now that I have some free time and the weather is getting warmer, I have decided to set off on a trip to inspect the various places in the short term," he said.</p>
<p>The Government Has Not Borrowed Foreign Debt at Present</p>
<p>There are rumors that the Ministry of Railways plans to borrow 250 million from the banking community. Minister of Railways Zhang Gongquan did not have any contacts in Shanghai. "I have not heard that China plans to borrow from Britain without success, and that Chen Guangfu, general manager of the Shanghai Bank, went to the United States again under orders to contact the United States for loans. Although China had intended to borrow from foreign countries to develop domestic construction, it is not currently underway. Although the US cotton and wheat loan was handled by me before, I have not been involved since I resigned as Minister of Finance, so it is difficult to answer whether it has been repaid or not." At that time, someone asked Mr. Song for his opinion on Japan's proposal of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." Mr. Song smiled and did not answer, instructing that he could inquire with the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. Mr. Song continued, "Some people advocate that banks reduce interest rates to relieve industry and commerce. The national banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, should first reduce the interest rates on loans to commercial banks. This may be possible, but it depends on the will of the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Group Elects – Ballots Issued Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ballots to be Counted at the City General Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM on the 9th; Letters Sent to the Municipal Government and Various Organizations Requesting Personnel to Supervise</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, the 15th election of the Chinese Taxpayers Association in the Concession, the individual group was elected on the 28th of last month. The Commercial and Native Place groups have been scheduled to submit their ballots on the 8th of this month. The ballots will be counted at the City General Chamber of Commerce on the second floor at 1:00 PM on the 9th. The association sent out election ballots at 2:00 PM yesterday and sent separate letters to the municipal government, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and various organizations, requesting them to send personnel to the meeting to supervise. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present – At 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the association sent out election ballots for the Commercial and Native Place groups at its office at 59 Hong Kong Road.

<p>Chairman's Report – Chairman Xu Jiqing reported on the investigation of the Commercial and Native Place groups, saying that the group election for this session received 184 survey forms from various commercial organizations and 119 survey forms from native place groups. However, in the commercial group, the candidate recommended by the Pigment Industry Association, Chuan Zaigao, had already been recommended as a candidate by the Hanging Ask Industry Association, which was a duplication. Therefore, the commercial group had a total of only 367 people, and 367 election ballots were issued. The native place group had a total of 238 people, and 238 election ballots were issued. Then, each representative supervised the number of ballots issued to be correct, and they were sent to the post office and sent out by express mail.</p>
<p>Letter to Various Organizations – The association sent separate letters to various organizations in the city yesterday, requesting them to send representatives to supervise at the time, saying, "Dear Sirs, In the 15th election of our association, all candidates for the commercial and native place groups were also recommended by various organizations.

<h3>Yesterday in the Huangpu River, a Japanese Ship Collided with a Chinese Ship</h3>
<p>The Tangshan Maru Collided with the Shihe, Causing Significant Damage</p>
<p>The Shihe, a transport ship of the Public Benefit Shipping Company in this port, was violently collided with by the Tangshan Maru, a Japanese ship of the Nisshin Company, in the Huangpu River yesterday. The Shihe's hull was hit, causing huge losses. After our reporter received the news, he went to various parties to investigate. The details of the matter are described as follows:</p>
<p>The Shihe Was About to Sail</p>
<p>The Shihe, a ship of the Public Benefit Shipping Company, weighs 1,513 tons, has a registered net tonnage of 918.27, is 157 feet 8 inches long, 24 feet 3 inches wide, and 15 feet 2 inches deep, has a draft of 17 feet 6 inches, has two decks, a triple expansion engine, 640 horsepower, and travels at 8.5 knots per hour. It was built in Germany in 1903. The ship came to Shanghai with coal this time and was berthed at the river piers 28 and 29 in the Huangpu River. After unloading the coal, it was ready to sail at about 10:00 AM yesterday. The Shihe was about to leave the river pier and head to Haizhou, but it was violently collided with by the Tangshan Maru, a Japanese ship that was entering the port at the time, causing significant damage.</p>
<p>Situation at the Time of the Collision</p>
<p>The Tangshan Maru of the Nisshin Company, which now sails from Nanhua to Shanghai and also sails the Northern Seas line, has a capacity of 2,089 tons. It had just loaded a large number of goods and passengers from Guangdong and other ports and returned to Shanghai. At about 10:00 AM yesterday, when it was approaching the Huangpu River surface of the power plant, it passed the river piers 28 and 29, just as the Shihe was turning around to leave the buoy and was about to sail. Suddenly, a sailboat came from the river. The Tangshan Maru was afraid of colliding with the sailboat, so it gave way slightly. However, the pressure of the tide was very great. The bow of the Tangshan Maru avoided the sailboat, but took advantage of the momentum to collide with the stern of the Shihe, causing a loud bang and a major disaster.</p>
<p>Extremely Serious Damage</p>
<p>At the time when the Shihe was hit, it had not yet left the river pier. The captain saw the bow of the Tangshan Maru sailing sideways, and because his ship was moored on the side of the river pier, there was no way to avoid it. He had to immediately raise a black flag, indicating that he was asking the other ship to stop immediately, otherwise a huge danger would occur. However, it was too late. The bow of the Tangshan Maru had violently collided with the left side of the stern of the Shihe. The stern of the Shihe was immediately broken, and the steel plates were torn in many places. The hole was one zhang square, and the buildings and railings on the stern deck were all destroyed, causing extremely heavy losses.</p>
<p>Joint Survey by Both Parties</p>
<p>After the accident, the Tangshan Maru immediately sailed back to the wharf to unload goods and passengers. The captain of the Shihe immediately reported to the Yihe Company, the agent of the ship in Shanghai. The company first sent personnel to the ship to inspect the damage, and then ordered the captain to submit a report and submit it to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the insurance company, asking them to send surveyors to the ship to survey. At that time, he also ordered the Shihe to suspend its departure and stay in Shanghai for major repairs. In the afternoon, the ship surveyors of the insurance company had gone to the Shihe and Tangshan Maru to inspect the ships. It is said that the damage to the Tangshan Maru was very minor. The issue of responsibility for the collision is currently difficult to discuss.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Lives in Seclusion in Shanghai to Recuperate</h3>
<p>Liu Luyin and Cheng Tiangu Still Stay in Shanghai; Wei Daoming Visited Wang Again Yesterday to Report</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. Because his nasal illness has not yet healed, he has been living in seclusion and resting for days, declining to see guests. Yesterday morning, according to Feng Zhizheng, secretary of Mr. Wang, to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, the rumor that Mr. Wang has decided to return to Guangdong on the 15th is not true. Since Mr. Wang returned to Shanghai, his condition has not changed. He is currently accompanied by a nurse to change his medicine and seek temporary rest. It is not yet decided when he will go to Beijing again. It is also learned that Cheng Tiangu, secretary of Mr. Hu Hanmin, chairman of the Central Standing Committee, who came from the north, and Liu Luyin, a member of the Central Committee and Minister of the Ministry of Central Government, are still staying in Shanghai and will not return to the south for a while. Mr. Cheng and Mr. Wang Chonghui are currently living in Mr. Hu Hanmin's new residence on Gaen Road. Wei Daoming, former Minister of Judicial Administration, returned to Shanghai from northern Guangdong the day before yesterday. In addition to having met with Mr. Wang once, he went to speak again at about 12:00 noon yesterday and continued to report everything for more than two hours before leaving. Mr. Wei is scheduled to go to Beijing within a few days to visit President Jiang and other central authorities.</p>

<h3>Silk Manufacturers Plan to Establish Artificial Silk Factory</h3>
<p>Capital of 10 Million Yuan, Half Government and Half Commercial; The Factory Plans to be Located in Hangzhou, Zhejiang</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, China's silk industry was once very developed. In recent years, it has been hit by the world's economic downturn and competition from artificial silk, and its situation has plummeted. It is found that artificial silk is an important raw material for silk production and is purely imported from abroad. There are no factories in China specializing in its manufacture. In view of this, silk manufacturers in this city have drawn up a plan and submitted it to the central government to establish an artificial silk factory. Preparations are now actively underway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>Because silk merchants in this city believe that the annual leakage of artificial silk is very large, they have drawn up a plan and asked Representative Wang Yansong to take it to Beijing and submit it to the Administrative and Industrial Departments to raise funds to establish a national artificial silk factory. It is heard that Minister of Finance Kong is very much in favor of this plan and has agreed to assist. Mr. Wang made satisfactory contacts in Beijing and immediately began preparations to raise funds after returning to Shanghai. It is heard that a certain amount of funds has already been raised.</p>
<p>Outline of the Plan</p>
<p>The planned capital of the factory is tentatively set at 10 million national currency, half government and half commercial. The government shares will be allocated by the government in one lump sum, while the commercial shares can be raised in the silk industry. The location of the factory is generally in Hangzhou, which is convenient for transportation. As for technical talents, there is still a shortage at the time of opening, and only foreign talents can be borrowed. Later, outstanding students from the Department of Chemistry and the Department of Textile Engineering of domestic universities will be selected to study in Europe and the United States, and they can be hired when they return. In addition, encouraging exports and expanding sales channels are all included in the plan. It is expected that when this plan is realized in the future, it will definitely be able to recover a part of the rights and interests.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Set Up Cotton Mills in North China – Chinese Cotton Yarn is in Greater Danger</h3>
<p>Japanese-Funded Cotton Mill in Tianjin Scheduled to Start Construction on the 15th; 90% of Transactions at the Cotton Yarn Exchange are Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>The Japanese cotton yarn industry has gained a special position of development in China. Recently, it has been protected by the government's policy of maintaining industry. A large-scale cotton mill has been established in Tianjin, and contacts have been established with factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, Wuhan, and other places. The Chinese cotton yarn market, which is already on its last breath, will be in greater danger. Because this matter concerns China's entire cotton yarn industry, the reporter has inquired with various parties concerned about the process. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Cotton Yarn Factory in North China Will Start Construction</p>
<p>There are six Chinese-funded cotton mills in Tianjin, including Yuyuan, Hengyuan, Beiyang, Baocheng, Yudai, and Huaxin. In recent years, due to the decline of the cotton yarn industry and the difficulty of economic turnover, the Japanese merchants have bought out two of them, Yudai and Yuyuan. It is found that the Japanese merchants have cotton mills in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou, but there are no cotton mills in Tianjin. Recently, in order to further expand the cotton yarn industry in China and manipulate the domestic market, the Toyo Cotton Mill, Osaka Spinning Co., and Zhongbo Spinning Co. have jointly established a new factory in Dongju, Tianjin. It is scheduled to start construction on the 15th. The first step of the plan is to equip 50,000 spindles, and the second step is to complete the increase of spindles to 100,000 by next year. In the future, when this plan is realized, not only will the original Chinese-funded cotton mills in Tianjin be controlled by it, but China's entire cotton yarn industry will also become a nest of overturned eggs, and there will be no one who can compete with the four enemies.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Number of Chinese and Japanese Spindles</p>
<p>Comparing the spindles of Chinese and Japanese cotton mills, there are currently about 2.7 million spindles in Chinese-funded cotton mills across the country. Because Chinese factories have difficulty in terms of raw material costs, interest rates, and capital liquidity, they have now reduced 3.5% (that is, 35% have been stopped). Although the current situation has seen a turnaround, it is still strong on the outside and weak on the inside. Japanese-funded cotton mills in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou have about 2.45 million spindles. Because of the improvement of their products, the low cost of interest, and the smooth sales,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>flourishing, the Japanese-funded cotton mills in Shanghai are working day and night to catch up with production, and they are still worried that the orders will not be enough to allocate. In contrast, it is truly chilling.</p>
<p>90% of Market Transactions are Japanese Yarn</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange on Edward Road has officially announced the opening of Japanese yarn since August 1 last year. In just over nine months, Japanese yarns such as Chenfeng from the Rihua Factory, Toyonen from the Toyota Factory, Shuiyue and Caiqiu from the Neiwaimian Factory, Sunlight from the Shanghai Factory, Binlai and Wuma from the Qingdao Gongda Factory, and others have accounted for more than 70% to 80% of the transactions in the market. The only Chinese yarns that can barely maintain their position in the market are Zhongren from the Shenxin Factory and a few others. In order to learn from the past and avoid future mistakes, if a few more days pass, I am afraid that Chinese yarn will not be able to maintain its position. Although it is now the time of Sino-Japanese relations adjustment and economic cooperation, the government and merchants are urged to rescue and protect this last remaining industry.</p>
<h3>North and South Power Plants Implement Power Supply Plan</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Plan to Expand 130,000 Kilowatts; Zhabei Transmits Electricity to Jiading and Taicang along the Sihukou Road The rural power supply plan of the Shanghai Chinese Electrical Company has been gradually implemented. In the future, after the new factory is completed, it will be expanded from 30,000 kilowatts to 130,000 kilowatts, which can supply power to a circle of 100 kilometers. The Zhabei Hydropower Plant will also transmit electricity to Jiading along the Sihukou Road. The details are as follows, which were obtained by the reporter of Dagong News Agency:</p>
<p>Purchase New Machines to Increase Power</p>
<p>The machines and boilers required for the company's new power plant were ordered from the German Siemens factory in October last year, including two 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, and two boilers were ordered from the British Babgok Factory. One boiler was ordered from the Czech Skoda Factory. Each boiler has a steam capacity of 70 tons and a steam pressure of 40 atmospheres. Other equipment such as distribution boards, transformer manufacturing water equipment, boiler electrical management, and coal addition equipment have also been contracted one after another. The total value of the above is 163,777 pounds sterling, equivalent to more than 2.7 million legal currency. The factory building design has reserved space for the installation of the third steam turbine generator and the fourth boiler in the future. Therefore, the future power generation capacity of the new factory can be increased from 30,000 kilowatts to 45,000 kilowatts without the need for additional piling and factory construction. The area of the factory base can accommodate the expansion of capacity to 130,000 kilowatts in the future. As for high-voltage voltages, there are two types: one is 5,500 volts, which is specially used for the existing high-voltage power transmission in the Hukun District, and the other is 33,000 volts, which is prepared for long-distance rural town high-voltage power transmission. In the future, when the new factory is completed and managed properly, the coal used for each degree of power generation will be reduced by at least 40% compared with the current coal used for power generation.</p>
<p>Extend the Route to Supply Power to the Countryside</p>
<p>In addition to the 30,000-volt high-voltage overhead wire, the 5,500-volt high-voltage overhead wire has been extended by 21 kilometers and 239 meters. Those that have been connected to provide power include Beiqiao, Puji Nursing Home, Zhuanqiao, Xingci Electric Factory, Zhujiagang Town, Changqiao Town, Gangko Town, Meilong Town, Hongqiao Town, Dongcaohejing, Hongqiao Road, 996 Alley, Hongqiao New Village, Caohe Temple, Xinlonghua, Zhengjiaqiao, Xinqiaocun, Xinqiao New Village, Tongjiazai, Minhang, and other places. Those that are still in progress but have not yet been electrified include Songjiang Electric Company and Zhupu Electric Lamp Factory. Those that are still being planned include Caohang Town, Huajing Town, Mingang Town, and Rose Garden New Village. When the power generation capacity is increased to 130,000 kilowatts in the future, it can supply electricity to a radius of 100 kilometers.</p>
<p>Zhabei Power Plant's Power Transmission Plan</p>
<p>In addition, the Huashang Zhabei Hydropower Company has provided electricity to Doushan, Dachang, Luodian, and other places to support rural construction in the past. Last year, the company responded to the needs of electric lamp factories in Jiading and Taicang counties and decided to carry out the same power transmission plan. The contract is still being signed. The first step of the project is to lay pole wires along the Sihukou Highway. After both parties agree on the power supply fee, it will be opened and implemented on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Tax Exemption for Export of Antique Porcelain Replicas</h3>
<p>Reply to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, to promote the export of national porcelain, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on February 6, requesting exemption from porcelain export taxes. The Federation received reply telegram No. 3939 from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, approving that antique porcelain replicas be treated as ordinary porcelain and exempted from tax. The original telegram stated: "To the Shanghai National Federation of Chambers of Commerce: The telegram of [date] regarding the request from overseas porcelain merchants such as Meicheng Porcelain Company to completely exempt porcelain export taxes has been noted. Previously, these merchants submitted a report to the Ministry, which was instructed to be reviewed by the Customs Administration through the Chief Inspectorate of Customs. The Ministry has further investigated that porcelain exports are currently tax-exempt under existing export regulations. The reason for taxing as antiques or antique porcelain replicas is due to the ancient dynastic marks and images on the porcelain. To alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain foreign trade in the porcelain industry, it is specifically stipulated that porcelain reported for export, if manufactured individually or in pairs and intended to be sold at high prices as antiques, should be taxed as antiques or antique porcelain replicas. However, porcelain manufactured in large quantities, even if bearing ancient dynastic marks and images to increase sales prices, will be considered porcelain and exempted from tax under item 233 of the export tariff. This order is issued by the Ministry for compliance and notification, and you are hereby notified. Stamped by the Ministry of Finance."</p>

<h3>Zhang Maogou Wounded by Chopping, the Inside Story Has Been Ascertained, Clan Dispute Over Land, Instigating Criminals to Harm</h3>
<p>Zhang Maogou, a local resident living in a flat on Chaoyang Road, worked at the Huitong Cotton Mill. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, at around 9 PM, he was attacked with knives and axes by enemies in a nearby wasteland, sustaining injuries to his head, legs, and buttocks. The assailants fled in all directions. Zhang collapsed in a pool of blood, barely alive. His mother, Xu, reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched detectives to the scene. The detectives learned that the assailants were Ding Cailang from Tongzhou, who was hiding at 29 Delhi Road, Wupulu, and others. They secretly went to the scene and arrested them. The mastermind, Zhang Quanfa, a local resident, was also apprehended. He was from the same clan as the victim and the dispute arose from a struggle over ancestral land. He had instigated an unknown accomplice to carry out the vicious attack and harm the victim's life. The detectives also went to 56 Chaoyang Road and arrested Zhang Quanfa. It was learned that he was a foreman at the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council. He was also taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court.

Zhang Xu, the mother of the victim, stated that the defendant, Zhang Quanfa, was indeed from the same clan and that the dispute was over a piece of land. During the recent Tomb Sweeping Festival, he forbade Zhang Maogou from going to burn ghost money, claiming that he controlled the land and refused to let the victim do so. He also instigated the defendant Ding Cailang to lure her son to that place to harm him. Judge Xiao ordered the two defendants to be questioned separately. Ding Cailang confessed that he had approached Zhang Quanfa seeking business, who told him that he had a feud with his clan brother, Zhang Maogou. He gave him two yuan and took out a sharp knife and an axe, ordering Ding and an unknown accomplice to go to the open space near the victim's house. Ding lured the victim out, and the unknown accomplice used the axe to hack at him, causing him to fall to the ground. Ding only stabbed the victim's legs four times with a small knife. He did not know the reason for their actions. Zhang Quanfa denied instigating Ding Cailang to harm Zhang Maogou, his other statements were evasive. Judge Xiao ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for 14 days pending further investigation after the victim recovers from his injuries.</p>

The maximum temperature for the same period last year was 62.2 degrees and the minimum was 49.3 degrees. Compared to the past few days, it was as if two different seasons had passed. Pedestrians on the road found their cotton clothes completely unsuitable. In the afternoon, they changed to lined shirts or even single-layer clothing. Due to the sultry heat, many workers were covered in sweat. Servers in taverns and teahouses bared their chests and stomachs, as if overwhelmed by the extreme heat. This phenomenon is unprecedented in recent years and is caused by the passage of a low-pressure system.</p>
<h3>Detective Chief Zhang Xinghai's Home Robbed, Four Thieves Searched at Will, Losses Exceed 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinghai, from Peiping, lives at 8, Lane 108 (Longzhi Li), at the intersection of Kang Nao Tuo Road and Dongjing Road in Shanghai West. He is currently a Chinese Detective Chief at the Hongkou Police Station of the Public Concession. Yesterday morning, at around 8:50 AM, just minutes after Zhang left home for work at the police station after having breakfast, four thugs broke into his home and robbed it at will. Zhang's family members were still upstairs at the time. Three of the four thugs were armed with pistols. They rushed up the stairs as soon as they entered the house, directly into Zhang's bedroom. They first threatened Zhang's female relatives with guns, then bound them one by one and confined them to a room, assigning one thug to guard them. The remaining thugs began to search everywhere, ransacking boxes and chests, turning the house upside down, and looting everything in sight for about half an hour before escaping by the same route. Shortly after, Zhang's family members managed to free themselves and urgently called Zhang's office, requesting him to return home immediately. After an inventory, it was discovered that they had been robbed of two pairs of gold bracelets, two pairs of gold earrings, eight gold rings, 500 yuan in silver dollars, and over 600 yuan in paper currency, totaling over 3,120 yuan. They filed a detailed loss report with the Gordon Road Police Station, which has jurisdiction. Chief Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei led detectives to the scene for investigation.

Dedicated detectives were assigned to search for the thugs and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Chinese Detectives Repeatedly Defied the Law, Released Not Long Ago, They Conspired to Commit Crimes Again and Were Arrested with Two Accomplices</h3>
<p>He En, a former Chinese detective from the Special Agency of the General Inspectorate of the Police, originally from Beiping, is now 47 years old. During his service, he was dismissed for bad character. After being dismissed, He did not think about making progress. Within the concession, he conspired with gangs to commit serious crimes of extorting money from people. The Zhabei Police Station detained He En and brought him to the First Special Court. The first trial sentenced He to life imprisonment. He refused to accept the judgment and appealed. The appeal was once rejected. He then appealed to the Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial. As a result, He's sentence was changed to seven years in prison and sent to prison. While serving his sentence, he was granted amnesty, so He was released from prison in August of last year and settled at No. 175 Wuzhou Road. Yesterday afternoon at 2:25 p.m., Feng Baishun, the Chinese detective captain of the Chengdu Road Police Station, and detectives Wang Yongjun and Sun Wenxi learned that someone was privately hiding firearms and secretly gathering in Room 124 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road, plotting wrongdoing. They immediately went with Western detectives and arrested Tao Shiying (also known as Xiao Tao) from Shaoxing and Shen Gengen from Pudong. Two pistols and fifteen bullets were found under the floor, and ropes, flashlights, and iron levers were found in the wall, all of which were taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Under interrogation, Tao Shiying confessed that the pistols were taken from He En's place and were prepared for committing crimes outside. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to No. 175 Wuzhou Road, arrested He, and took him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 187 of the Criminal Law for the crime of privately possessing firearms, and stated the above situation. Defendant Tao Shiying was summoned and admitted at the police station that he had committed a theft case. In addition, since the confiscated pistols and bullets had not been sent to the Bureau of Works for inspection, he requested an extension. Tao Shiying confessed that the guns and bullets were taken from He En's place by Jian Nan, who was at large, and were prepared for stealing outside. But before that, He and I had committed a theft case on Seymour Road, stealing more than 300 yuan worth of items, and I got 91 yuan, and so on. Shen Gengen confessed that he had not committed any crimes. He En confessed that he knew nothing about the pistols. Tao Shiying once asked me to sell two diamond rings and nine pieces of jewelry such as earrings, which I sold to the Zhuyu Tea Association in Nanshi for a total of 1,000 yuan. Afterwards, I got dozens of yuan in reward, and so on. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confession and ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody, and the hearing will be rescheduled for the 15th.</p>
<h3>Three Thieves Used False Names to Rent Houses for Theft Committing Twenty Cases in Three Months</h3>
<p>Two brothers, Wu Xida and Wu Xitang, from Changzhou, colluded with Wang Asan from Ningbo, specializing in renting rooms in the concession where residents posted advertisements for renting houses. These people disguised themselves as tenants and entered the houses to rent bedrooms, taking the opportunity to steal clothes, or giving a deposit of one yuan first. The next day, they pretended to tidy up the room in advance, and took the opportunity to steal things and hide them on their bodies and escaped. There are countless people who have been fooled. But the net of heaven is vast. The Chinese detectives Guangfu, Wang Debiao, and Bai Mingfu of the Hongkou Police Station learned of it and arrested the three thieves and sent them to the First Special Court for detention. It was found during the rescheduling that these people used this plan to steal clothes, cash and other items worth more than 300 yuan from the Shen family at No. 180 Qipu Road, He Shunxiang at No. 168 Xinzha Road, Zhu Jieren at No. 229 Guizhou Road, and Li Jincai at No. 159 Meibage Road from December 9 of last year to March 5 of this year, totaling 20 households. On December 9 of last year at about 2:00 p.m., a tenant of Cai Yuanfu, a second landlord at No. 8, Lane 344, Baker Road, had a wallet stolen, containing a small watch worth dozens of yuan, which had been found in a pawnshop and pawned for ten yuan. But the victim moved to another place and could not be found. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao came to the Third Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the Bureau of Works, said that the three defendants still had nine theft cases, and the victims had not been found. Please postpone the hearing again. The court approved.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Pulling Patients Tea Servant and Apprentice Each Worked for Their Master Ma Bosun Was Accused of Inciting Injury</h3>
<p>Ma Bosun, a Chinese medicine doctor from Kunshan, is only 24 years old. He is the grandson of Ma Fengbo, an expert in throat diseases. He set up a clinic at No. 902 HaiGe Road. Chen Qisheng was originally a student of Ma Fengbo. After graduating, he hung up a sign next to Ma's clinic at No. 2, Anli, Lane 924, HaiGe Road, to practice medicine, which inevitably hindered Ma Bosun's business. At about 10:00 a.m. on the 28th of last month, Lu Yuansheng, a Changshu apprentice of Chen Qisheng, went out on business. Just as he arrived at the entrance of Anli Lane, he saw Gu Er, a tea servant from Tongzhou hired by Ma Bosun, attracting his teacher's patients to Ma Bosun's clinic (commonly known as pulling patients). He immediately negotiated with him. Gu immediately started fighting and beat Lu, causing injuries. Lu then reported to the Sima Police Station, and the police chief ordered him to file a lawsuit in court himself. Lu then filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Ma Bosun of inciting Gu Er to cause injury. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao of the Fifth Criminal Court summoned them for questioning. Lu Yuansheng stated the above situation. Ma Bosun confessed that he knew nothing about the fight between A Er and the plaintiff. How could he be said to have incited it? Gu A confessed that at that time, a patient asked me for the address of Ma Fengbo, and I told him. Several people including the plaintiff came out and beat me, and so on. Gao Junxiang, the lawyer of Ma and others, pointed out that the plaintiff was pulling the defendant's business. Judge Ye ordered the debate to begin after the facts were clear, and then announced the end and scheduled the verdict for next Monday.</p>

<p>Interrogation on Brothel Loan Among the creditor households, Ying Huizhen of Wendi Brothel reported an amount of 10,000 yuan, while the debtor only admitted to 1,000 yuan, which caused a dispute at the first creditors' meeting.

<h3>Shen Jinquan Forcibly Abducted His Cousin for Friends to Violate She Was Detained for Twelve Days Before Escaping She Was Detained and Sent to Court and the Verdict is Pending</h3>
<p>Shen Wensheng, a villager of Shenjiawan Shenjiazai in Zhabei, has a daughter named Lianying, who is 19 years old this year. She is quite beautiful. Shen loves her like a jewel in his palm, and is determined to choose a good husband before marrying her. Therefore, she has not been selected for a long time. Shen's cousin, Shen Jinquan, is a driver for the Southern Automobile Company. He is used to wandering and does not know etiquette. He has a close friendship with a colleague named A Quan. He often invites him to play at home. A Quan sees Lianying's beautiful face and covets her beauty. He often thinks of himself as a son-in-law and once asked Shen Jinquan and Jinquan's brother Jinrong to plot to marry her. However, he was despised by Shen Wensheng and his good dream was difficult to achieve. Therefore, he sought second best and wanted to have an affair to fulfill his long-cherished wish. He sought advice from Shen Jinquan. It is shocking that Jinquan disregarded everything and designed to hire a car in advance as an act of forced abduction. Because Lianying works in the Gongda Yarn Factory, she must go out. It is a good plan to start on the way. As a result, at 9 a.m. on February 17, Lianying and her cousin Jinlian were walking together, half a mile away from home, when Shen Jinquan came out to stop her, half-luring and half-forcing her into the car and driving away. Jinlian watched her sister go, and kept silent. But Lianying was taken to a secret room. A Quan arrived and quenched his thirst and thoughts. This happened for twelve days. Her body was violently broken and her lower body was severely injured. She was rushed to the hospital for treatment in a hurry. After she was slightly recovered, she was led back to hide. Guessing her intention, she wanted to use the fait accompli method to make Shen Wensheng agree. Unexpectedly, on April 1, A Quan went out on business and the defense was relatively loose. Shen Lianying, unable to bear the pain, thought that the opportunity had come. She escaped and ran to her aunt's house, crying and telling the previous situation. After being sent home, Shen Wensheng twisted Shen Jinrong to the police station and handed him over to Shen Jinquan, and sent them together to the local court. Shen Jinrong was released on bail, and Shen Jinquan was detained. On the one hand, Shen Wensheng filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Court for abduction and rape. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu heard the case. Shen Lianying confessed the same situation as before, and Shen Jinlian proved the situation at that time. When questioned, the defendant said that Shen Wensheng borrowed money and failed, and set up this trap out of resentment. Under the official order to start the debate, and based on Shen Lianying's confession that her lower body was injured, she ordered a forensic examination and said, "The debate is over, and the verdict will be heard later. The defendant will be remanded in custody," and it was decided that the hearing will be resumed on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Poor People Stole Manure and Became Violent, Beating and Injuring the Inspector Workers of the Cleaning Station</h3>
<p>Recently, the cleaning station in Yinxiang District, Zhabei, has found that the manure stored in the toilets in Zhangjia Lane, Derun Road, and other places has been stolen by poor people from other provinces. Therefore, it sent manure workers to strengthen the inspection and prevention. Yesterday afternoon, the manure workers found someone stealing stored manure in the toilet on Derun Road and reported it to the station inspector, who went to intervene. They were beaten by a crowd of poor people from other provinces. The manure workers and inspectors were outnumbered and injured. Afterwards, the police station found a perpetrator and sent him to the station for interrogation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Stealing Manure</p>
<p>The cleaning station in Yinxiang District, Zhabei, is contracted by merchants and pays fees on a monthly basis. The station has set up more than ten toilets in Zhangjia Lane, Derun Road, and other places in the district to facilitate residents' storage of manure, killing two birds with one stone. The station's manure is usually transported to Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, where farmers purchase it for fertilizing the fields. Recently, the station discovered that the manure stored in the toilets was stolen by poor people from other provinces. It was found that Xiao Qilong, Xiao Kouzi, Daba Zi, and Er Mazi were instigating it. It was not investigated. Therefore, it sent manure worker Zhao Deyuan (from Gaoyou, 43 years old, living at No. 2, Xiangshan Lane, Wuhua Road) to strengthen the inspection and prevention.</p>
<p>Poor People Became Violent</p>
<p>At about 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Zhao found someone stealing manure in the toilet on Derun Road, packing it in buckets and transporting it privately. According to reports, inspector Dong Xingen (from Shanghai, 38 years old) went to the scene with Zhao. The thieves abandoned the manure buckets and fled in all directions. Zhao took several manure buckets back to the station for temporary placement. This aroused the anger of the poor people from other provinces, who gathered more than 20 people and rushed to beat Dong and Zhao with shoulder poles. Dong and Zhao were outnumbered and injured in the waist, head, shoulders, and back. Their clothes and hats were covered with manure. Fortunately, the Linping Road Police Station in charge of the area received the report and sent police to the scene, arresting the main culprit, Chen Linfa (also known as Er Mazi, from Funing, 45 years old, living in a thatched shed No. 88, Pingmin Village), and brought him to the station for interrogation. The remaining criminals fled and were not caught.</p>
<p>The Criminal Was Sent to the Station</p>
<p>According to the interrogation at the police station, inspector Dong Xingen and manure worker Zhao Deyuan of the cleaning station stated that Chen and the other fugitives, Xiao Qilong, Daba Zi, Xiao Kouzi, etc., instigated poor people from other provinces to steal manure. It was not uncommon. In order to settle the matter, they did not investigate. This time, because they went to intervene, they were violently beaten by Chen and others. They demanded severe punishment. When Chen Linfa was interrogated, he cunningly denied stealing manure and fighting. The police station, because the case involved accusations of theft and injury, and involved criminal prosecution, sent a document to the station along with the three plaintiffs and defendants for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Two Thieves Arrested While Inspecting Pedestrians</h3>
<p>Detectives Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, Yang Yilong, and patrolmen Xu Guilin and Feng Yizhi of the French Concession Police Station were ordered to inspect pedestrians on the afternoon of the 4th at about 6 p.m. When they were passing the intersection of Conti Road and Caishi Road, two robbers suddenly came face to face. The detectives thought that these people's actions were suspicious, so they immediately stepped forward and arrested them together. Under interrogation, one claimed to be Wu Qing, 34 years old, from Jiangbei, and the other was Bu Wanjun, 37 years old, from Zhenjiang. An eight-inch pistol and ten bullets were found on Wu, who confessed to robbing the Ruifengxiang tobacco and paper shop at No. 130 Conti Road. They were taken to the police station and also admitted to robbing several times in the concession. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. First, the police station's lawyer stated the case and requested a rescheduled investigation. Wu Qing confessed that Yao Si, who was at large, gave me the pistol that day and wanted to rob Ruifengxiang tobacco and paper.

The judge ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody and scheduled a further hearing on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chen Ruifu's Concubine Acquisition Leads to a Series of Family Troubles</h3>
<p>Wife Initially Accuses Him of Adultery Without Success, Now Petitions the Court for Divorce</p>
<p>Chen Ruifu, a native of Ningbo and a senior staff member at the Renji Road Yingli Import and Export Company, residing at No. 50, Zhen De Fang, Baoding Road, Huishan Road, married Wang Minghua (currently 31 years old), a woman from Ningbo, in 1926 through a matchmaker. For a decade, their relationship was considered harmonious, but they had no children. Recently, Wang Minghua suddenly noticed that her husband's behavior had changed drastically, becoming abnormal, ambitious, and not returning home at night. She began to investigate and discovered that her husband</p>
<p>Had an Affair</p>
<p>and was cohabitating with Wu Lingzi, a 23-year-old woman from Hangzhou, at No. 47, Shufeng South Lane, Baoding Road. Consequently, on February 21st of this year, she reported this information to the Huishan Police Station, who dispatched officers to apprehend Chen Ruifu and Wu Lingzi together and bring them to the First Special Court. Under interrogation, Chen Ruifu admitted to taking Wu Lingzi as a concubine, and it was also learned that Wang Minghua had long been aware of this. As a result, the court</p>
<p>Declared Chen Ruifu and Wu Lingzi Innocent in the case. Now, Wang Minghua has hired lawyer E Sen and filed a petition with the civil division of the First Special Court, requesting a divorce from her husband Chen Ruifu and an order for him to pay alimony. Yesterday afternoon, around 2 p.m., judge Tao Dejun presided over the hearing in the Seventh Civil Court. The plaintiff, Chen Wang Minghua, accompanied by lawyer E Sen, appeared in court and stated that the defendant, Chen Ruifu, had committed adultery with another woman, Wu Lingzi, and that the plaintiff had reported this to the Huishan Police Station, who arrested them and brought them to the criminal court of this court for trial. The defendant also confessed in court, so the</p>
<p>Facts of the Case have already been recorded in the criminal court's records. She requested the court to investigate and retrieve the case file for clarification. She also stated that although the defendant's family is wealthy, before the division of property, his economic power rested with her. Therefore, when he was engaged in business outside, he often needed funds, which the plaintiff provided assistance with. However, since last year, after receiving a portion of his inheritance from his father, he has treated the plaintiff as worthless, not only failing to return the borrowed jewelry but also ceasing to provide living expenses. Instead, he</p>
<p>Embraced New Love and did not remember the past hardships, clearly severing their marital bond. This aligns with the provisions of Article 1052, Section 2 of the Civil Code, which pertains to adultery. Therefore, she requested the court to order a divorce between the two parties, to order the defendant to return the borrowed jewelry worth 15,000 yuan, to order the return of the plaintiff's inherent property worth 4,500 yuan, to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff alimony at a rate of 150 yuan per month until she reaches the age of sixty, totaling</p>
<p>54,000 Yuan, and to order the defendant to bear the costs of this lawsuit, etc. The defendant, Chen Ruifu, did not appear but sent lawyer Yuan Yang'an as his representative to defend the case. He argued that the plaintiff and defendant had been married for ten years and their relationship had been harmonious. The only reason he took a concubine was because the plaintiff could not bear children, for the sake of continuing the family line, and to live together permanently with shared wealth. The plaintiff was already aware of this and did not object. Therefore, the criminal court declared him innocent.</p>
<p>According to Civil Law Article 1053, "A party with the right to claim based on the circumstances in sections 1 and 2 of the preceding article may not request a divorce if they have agreed to it in advance, condoned it afterward, or if more than six months have passed since becoming aware of it, or if more than two years have passed since the occurrence of the circumstances." He also stated that he was unable to afford alimony. Therefore, he requested that the court</p>
<p>Dismiss the Plaintiff's lawsuit. Moreover, since both parties are intellectuals, he requested that the court persuade the plaintiff to reconcile, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer, E, further stated that regarding the issue of infertility, it had been verified by a doctor that the defendant was actually infertile, and the fault was not with the plaintiff, etc. Judge Tao reviewed the evidence and decided to persuade the plaintiff. The case was rescheduled for further hearing on the afternoon of the 23rd, and both lawyers were instructed to attempt a reconciliation.</p>

At the time, Tan and his family were asleep. Seeing that the four robbers each had a handgun, they were afraid to make any noise. Tan's wife, Yu, seeing the situation was unfavorable, immediately slipped out the back door and shouted for help. As a result, 56 yuan in legal tender and a pocket watch were stolen. By the time the local police station arrived, the robbers had already disappeared.</p>

<h3>Purchasing Counterfeit Currency to Swindle Women</h3>
<p>Deng Peng, a Henan woman residing at No. 26, Dongxin Lane, Maidie'an Road, French Concession, is 21 years old this year. The other day, she brought Liu Jinsheng, a Shandong man, to the French police station, claiming that in February, her relative Shao Ziqing introduced Liu Jinsheng to the woman, saying that he knew a private counterfeit currency operation where ten yuan could buy one hundred yuan in counterfeit currency. If one hundred yuan could buy one thousand yuan, one could become rich immediately. Therefore, the woman believed him and gave him one hundred yuan in silver, entrusting him to buy counterfeit currency. Unexpectedly, after he left, there was no news until now, when she finally bumped into him. Therefore, she brought this case to the authorities, requesting an investigation. The police chief, believing that Liu had committed fraud, ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer requested a postponement for further investigation. Liu Jinsheng denied fraud. Judge Qiu ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

That day was the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, and the owner of the Minhua factory, Lu Jingli, had prepared fine dishes and wine to reward all the workers. While cooking, due to carelessness with fire, it caught fire and was destroyed. The Liuhefeng Material Shop was damaged by the spreading fire. The owner of Liuhefeng, Qu Yijian, was actually in his hometown for tomb sweeping.

<h3>Two Suicide Attempts by Poisoning</h3>

Soon after, the poison took effect and he could not be saved. The waiter noticed this and took him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that he had taken too much poison and his life was in danger.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Everything in the world is constantly changing.</p>
<p>"Water that does not flow becomes stagnant." Similarly, the development and progress of all undertakings will inevitably lag behind and fail if we do not constantly pay attention to improving and innovating, and strive to make them new every day.</p>
<p>"Progress" is the characteristic that everyone should have in this turbulent era, because "if you don't advance, you retreat." We should always be afraid of falling behind and being abandoned and destroyed in the fierce competition for survival.</p>
<p>However, many people often think that the improvement of everything in society is holistic and sudden, and they do not understand the principle of focusing on the big picture and starting with the small details. In fact, we can only achieve final success by starting with the small details and gradually finding ways to improve and evolve.</p>
<p>"Gradual change" leads to "sudden change." This is what philosophy tells us.</p>
<h3>Nomadic Life in the City</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>In our metropolis, the "Paris of the East," people of the upper, middle, and lower classes all live somewhat like nomads who move according to water and grass.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the upper class. Although the upper class lives in large Western-style houses with gardens in front and lawns in back, heaven knows if they spend one or two nights in these houses out of ten days. Usually, they spend the night in one hotel today, then stay in another hotel tomorrow, and naturally switch to yet another hotel the day after tomorrow. Even if they don't stay in hotels, there are many other places to stay. The small mansions of the second and third concubines are also available. If these places become tiresome, they might as well go to a brothel and stay for one or two nights. If it's a Saturday night, they can dance or gamble all night, without worrying about where to spend the night.</p>
<p>The middle class, although not as absolutely unsettled as the upper class, must at least change their residence according to the seasons. For example, in winter, they live in the house, but in summer, they have to lie in rattan chairs on the balcony or in the alleyway to avoid the heat and bedbugs in the house. Some simply take a straw mat and seek a good dream on the sidewalk next to the street. They only return to the house after the weather cools down. And people in this class may sometimes spend one or two nights in a hotel at the beginning of the month when they get paid, gambling and playing with women, and temporarily abandoning their fixed family life.</p>
<p>As for the lower class, they are absolutely unsettled. In summer, they lie under vegetable sheds; in winter, they lie at the entrance of alleys. In addition, bathhouses, porridge shops, boiler rooms, swallow's nests, etc., are all good places to avoid the cold and spend the night. If they have some money to spare, they can spend a dozen cents to occupy a bunk in a small inn. Most of these people play the flute in "Shanghai," begging for food everywhere. Today they are in Yangshupu, tomorrow in Caojiadu, and the day after tomorrow they mix into Gaochang Temple. Their whereabouts are uncertain, and they are content with whatever comes their way, living a completely nomadic life.</p>
<p>Originally, anyone who wants to make a living in Shanghai is actually not much different from the nomadic people who move according to water and grass.</p>
<h3>The Ruins of Wu Zicheng</h3>
<p>— Fan Fei</p>
<p>After finishing my classes, I went to Wu Yuan for tea and ran into my old classmate Jiang Dayi, whom I hadn't seen in more than three years. After a few brief greetings, he opened a paper bag and pointed to the animal bones, ox horns, pottery shards, and carbonized wood pieces inside, saying, "These things are about the same age as the Most Holy Teacher." Then he said, "These things were found at Wang Feiji." I asked him about the cause and effect of obtaining these things, and he gave the following account: Based on the history of Wang Feiji, Jiang concluded that the palace of Zhang Shicheng at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the palace of the King of Wu during the Warring States period, and Wu Zicheng were all in this area, so he began to investigate. One day, behind the park, the Jincheng Bank was under major construction. Ming and Qing porcelain shards were found in the excavated soil. Next to a newly dug pit about five cubic meters deep, the silt dug from the pit was piled up. In this silt, animal bones, ox horns (related to ancient people's food), geometric pattern ancient pottery shards, and black pigment pottery shards were found. After obtaining these culturally significant items and studying them, it became clear that they were relics from the Warring States period, and the site of Wu Zicheng was also confirmed. However, due to regulations on the excavation of antiquities, it is not possible to excavate immediately and understand the underground situation. When the relevant academic institutions and people from all countries have a plan and excavate layer by layer, there will be some amazing results.</p>
<h3>Can it Withstand this Storm?</h3>
<h3>Swapping the Nest, Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Prologue: Appreciating Chrysanthemums Near Double Ninth Festival, Seeking Tranquility in a Small Gathering; Recalling Old Dreams with Linked Pearls, Drinking Bitter Tears for Thousands of Autumns</p>
<p>Dabai separated a long leaf and searched for a long time before picking a small stem of flowers and handing it to me. I looked at the flower. The long flower stem was somewhat like a small Western begonia. The petals were purple, and the flower bud was like a small sachet, very exquisite. I brought it to my nose and smelled it. It had a fragrance that was stronger than orchids. I concentrated for a while, clapped my hands, and said, "Now I understand. This is a famous Western flower called violet, and there is a sad and beautiful myth about it." Dabai said, "Isn't everything here inside and out violets? So this small garden has become the Violet Hermitage. When these flowers are in full bloom in April and May, the fragrance fills the alley, and Brother Lan is most proud of it." I said, "Brother Lan loves violets most in his life. No matter what he does, he always brings this up. You can say that he has an affinity for flowers and loves them as much as his life." As we were talking, Lan Chang walked over. He smiled and said, "I invited you to appreciate chrysanthemums, not violets. Let's go, let's see the chrysanthemums." He happily led us into the garden. Although the garden was small, it had everything: earthen hills and fish ponds. Hundreds of pots of chrysanthemums of various sizes were arranged around, either leaning against short fences, half-hidden by rocks, emerging from under large tree trunks at an angle, or placed on piles of fallen leaves in the bamboo shade, all containing the composition of a painter according to the plumpness, richness, and lightness of the flowers. Some of the guests were chatting idly on the flower bed lawn, some were standing under the bamboo forest, and some were walking along the winding pebble paths, each according to their own preference. Only the host was busy everywhere, greeting the guests. But my purpose was not to see the chrysanthemums. I invited Lan Chang to sit in a living tree pavilion on the earthen hill. This was a small hexagonal pavilion supported by living trees. Inside, there was a stone table and four wooden benches, directly facing the chrysanthemums. The tree trunks supported the winding railings, making it a great place to sit. At this time, there were a few light clouds like white silk smeared in the sky, and the garden had a new shade, which was very pleasant. Then the treetops shook, making a rustling sound, but a few drops of rain fell. I said, "These few clouds and a few drops of rain are very poetic. It's really a fine rain chrysanthemum day. In this beautiful scene, we must talk about something pleasant. Can Brother Lan's novel material be announced?" Lan Chang smiled and said, "That kind brother hasn't arrived yet." I was stunned and asked, "Which kind brother?" Lan Chang smiled and said, "I said the novel material was hidden in my house, that was wronging you, just to trick you into coming to my house for a meal. As for the supplier of the material, it's a Mr. Ruan. He has quite a bit to do with this matter. Originally, he entrusted me to write a novel. When I inquired about the location of the story, it was Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Beiping. I had no way to describe those three places, so I recommended you. This was also my good intention, because I thought it would be better if the locality in the novel was written more realistically." When I heard Mr. Ruan, I thought of a bearded man. (5)</p>
<h3>Three People Walking Together</h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>On the way home, I happened to meet three people who were walking in the same direction as me. As we walked along, their appearance and conversation made me realize that these three people were of three different types.</p>
<p>The first was in his thirties, or perhaps not even thirty? Because his face was full of smoker's marks and his skin was so thin that he looked very old. According to what he told the other two, he not only smoked opium but also took red pills. He really looked like his addiction was starting, and his steps seemed so heavy and slack.</p>
<p>The second was quite strong, but his red eyes told of a lack of sleep. He was happily talking about gambling strategies all the way. It is said that he was going to gamble.</p>
<p>The third joined us halfway. He came out of a small hotel, looking very drunk, and an unpleasant smell of alcohol often blew into my nose. After walking a few streets like this, he met a friend, and he pulled this friend into a nearby hotel, saying, "I'll pay the bill."</p>
<p>When I got home, I thought to myself, Confucius said, "When three people walk together, there must be one who can be my teacher." Today I met three people walking together, but which one should I learn from? Smoking, gambling, and drinking are not allowed by Confucius! Then I thought, that's right, these three people are actually my good teachers.</p>
<p>The smoker is constant and persistent, immersed in it, shouldn't I emulate him in my studies? The gambler is brave and persistent, shouldn't I emulate him in my career? The drinker uses drunkenness to relieve sorrow and is generous to friends, shouldn't I emulate him in my interactions with the world? These three people are really my good teachers.</p>
<h3>The Grades of Wealthy People</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>A and B were equally wealthy, each living in a village, and both were known as wealthy gentlemen. One day, A visited B for something, but B was not home. B's wife knew about it and thought: I've heard that A is also a wealthy person, so I might as well estimate him. I'll go out and entertain him.</p>
<p>When they met, they couldn't help but exchange pleasantries first. Then, A explained the purpose of his visit, so the wealthy lady looked A up and down, making A feel a little embarrassed. Unexpectedly, she suddenly opened her mouth and said, "Looking at you, you're not even a first-class wealthy person, probably second-class!"</p>
<p>A was a little stunned at first, but after calming down, he asked, "May I ask: What's the difference between a first-class wealthy person and a second-class wealthy person?"</p>
<p>Her answer was this: "First-class wealthy people have seven houses, second-class have five houses, and third-class have three houses: this is the standard for determining the grade of wealthy people."</p>
<p>A was even more confused, so he asked, "What do you mean by 'houses'?"</p>
<p>She then answered unhurriedly: "I'll tell you, wealthy people are divided into three grades. Third-grade is just the minimum for a wealthy person. The so-called three houses are: the inner house, the guest house, and the kitchen. Second-grade, when a guest comes, you don't have to open the door yourself, the doorman does it for you; when collecting rent, you don't have to do it yourself, the accountant does it for you. Adding the inner house, the guest house, and the kitchen, isn't that five houses? First-grade, in addition to the five houses, there are also the stable and the concubine's house!"</p>
<p>A was silent for a while before saying, "I'm ashamed to say that I can only be a second-class wealthy person!" It turned out that when A came to visit B, B's wife found out that he had come in a sedan chair, so she said that. On the one hand, it seemed to be mocking A, and on the other hand, it was simply expressing that B was a higher grade than him!</p>
<p>Readers, you can estimate for yourselves which grade you belong to!</p>
<p>New Inventions</p>
<h3>Inventions from Around the World</h3>
<p>— Jing Renfang</p>
<p>Lightless Cannon During the European War, people invented various methods to observe the location of enemy cannons. These methods generally involved observing the enemy's cannon fire from two locations, and then immediately calculating the true location of the cannon, and using artillery to counterattack. Now, a Dutch inventor has registered a method with the patent office to prevent the enemy from seeing the fire when firing a cannon: that is, when firing a cannon, a stream of liquid mist is sprayed around the muzzle to prevent the heat from coming into contact with the outside air, thus becoming a lightless cannon.</p>
<p>Factory-Style Human Body Model The New York Science Museum recently displayed a human body model whose structure is similar to a factory. Processes like breathing, digestion, blood circulation, and other life activities are shown in a very realistic way. For example, light bulbs are used to represent the flow of carbon dioxide and oxygen, and a grinder represents human molars. The heart is represented by a piston, which allows you to see the movement of blood. Even more interesting is that the brain is divided into areas, and its structure completely follows the natural arrangement of the human brain: 1. Judgment, represented by a court; 2. Intelligence, represented by a classroom; 3. Management, represented by a guide; 4. Muscle control, represented by a railroad switch; 5. Willpower, represented by an executive committee meeting; 6. Breathing management, represented by measuring instruments and scales; 7. Hearing, represented by a recording studio; 8. Vision, represented by a photographer's office; 9. Nerve center, represented by a telephone transformer.</p>
<p>Skyscraper An American architect recently proposed that the government build a 196-story skyscraper in the center of a famous city to serve as a shopping mall, reaching a height of over 2,000 feet. It is said that the construction cost of this shopping mall would be $223 million US. The internal equipment would be sufficient for all commercial applications, and it could accommodate 250,000 people, and could also have large, medium, and small schools, and hospitals and factories, etc. There would also be several floors rented to industrialists as exhibition venues for their products. The construction materials would mainly be steel and white ceramics, and the design would pay attention to art and hygiene.</p>
<p>Heat-Emitting Device Clears Fog Recently, New York City has been testing a heat-emitting device that can clear fog. Once this light is emitted into dense fog, it can be used at airports to allow airplanes to land safely, which is very useful. This device is shaped like a searchlight, but has no lens. It is mounted on a car for easy transfer. The heat emitted is generated by an internal electric arc light. It contains a special electrode, and the current used is the same as that of an ordinary searchlight. The beam of light is very narrow, so its power is very strong, and it can turn water into steam, so it is very easy to reduce fog. When emitted at an airport, the light first sweeps the ground, and then uses mirrors coated with iron foil to reflect it into the sky. Even in heavy fog, a funnel-shaped light can be revealed, and it can soon be completely clear.</p>
<p>Frameless Metal Balloon Recently, the Soviet Union produced a metal balloon with a volume of 1,000 cubic meters that has no frame at all. Its outer shell is made of 0.1 cm thick rust-resistant metal, which is strong and durable. Because there is no rigid frame, the structure can be simplified and economized, and it can be manufactured by machine. The greatest benefit during flight is the elimination of "gas waves," because its outer shell can protect the gas, and it can also use the exhaust gas from the engine. The huge elasticity of the airship allows it to approach the ground for exercises. According to the inventor, the famous scientist Tsiolkovsky, people can manufacture huge airships and become cheap and safe mass transportation tools.</p>

<h3>Dr. Rong Qizhao in Hong Kong Discusses World Games Football Preselection</h3>
<p>Determine player selection with an impartial attitude; The position of football team captain has not yet been decided; Preselection players from various regions are scheduled to depart for Hong Kong</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondent) Dr. Rong Qizhao, a member of the Chinese National Sports Association and the World Games Football Selection Committee, was ordered to come to Hong Kong to preside over everything. He has been in Hong Kong for several days. The day before yesterday, Mr. Rong discussed the arrangements with Yan Chengkun, Chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Association, and others at the Seaview Hotel. Yesterday, reporters interviewed Mr. Rong to inquire about the previous evening's discussion. Mr. Rong absolutely denied the rumors that the official representatives to participate in the World Games football had already been internally decided. Also, good players from both Singapore and Shanghai have telegraphed Hong Kong, and will be arriving soon, expected to be all there before April 4, and the official representatives can be decided on the 12th. There was also discussion about allocating players from Singapore and Shanghai to join the Sanhua First Division for ordinary cup matches. The following is recorded, which is also what those who care about China's participation in the World Games football want to know first.</p>
<p>Problems Arise Along the Way</p>
<p>The reporter first asked Mr. Rong if there were any results from the previous evening's discussion that could be released. According to him, it was just a private conversation that evening, and no concrete discussions were held because the players from various regions had not all arrived. At the same time, there are also problems with the locations of future battles along the way. It is said that the Singapore Football Association is quite unwilling to let its Singaporean players be recruited by China. The proposal to conquer Singapore is currently pending resolution. Also, it is difficult to allocate players from various regions to join the Sanhua team for ordinary cup matches, because the Sanhua teams all have hopes of winning the championship. It will be a problem to assign someone to which team, and even if they are assigned, they may not be able to achieve cooperative effects. Therefore, it is necessary to wait until all the members arrive and see which team needs which players before a proper allocation can be made.</p>
<p>Extremely Cautious about the Qualifications of the Selection Committee</p>
<p>There are a total of five members of the World Games Football Selection Committee, including Shen Siliang as the convener, Hao Gengsheng, Ma John, and Mr. Rong and Yan. According to Mr. Rong, he received a telegram from Shanghai stating that some members of the selection committee, along with players from Shanghai and North China, will depart for Hong Kong by ship today (the 1st) and arrive in three days. Who are the members of the selection committee, and will all three arrive? Because the telegram was brief, it is not yet known in detail and will only be known at the time. As for the qualifications of the selection committee, the Standing Committee of the Association has tried its best to avoid appointing those who are directly related to various parties, such as Mr. Le Xiurong and Yu Hengzhi of Shanghai, and Mr. Huang Jiajun of Hong Kong, all of whom are seniors in the football world, but have not been appointed as selectors for this reason. Among the five selectors, in addition to Yu (Mr. Rong himself) and Yan Shen, Ma Bang has no connection with football. As for the Hong Kong selectors, it is believed that it will be one of Shen and Hao. As for Mr. Ma, it is said that he may not come to participate because Jida University in Beiping does not have a spring break.</p>
<p>Players from Various Regions Arrive in Hong Kong One After Another</p>
<p>Regarding the news of the preliminary players who were originally planned by the National Sports Association to come to Hong Kong to participate in the preselection, the reporter also interviewed Rong Qizhao. According to the answer, now that the preselection period is approaching, many preselection players from various regions are preparing to come to Hong Kong. Yesterday, I received telegrams from North China and East China, and letters from the four Malayan players, reporting their itineraries. Players from North China, such as Tan Fuzhen, have arrived in Shanghai and decided to join players from East China and take the President McKinley south tomorrow (the 1st), arriving in Hong Kong in about three days. The original plan was for everyone to take the Java ship, but it would not arrive until the 5th. I saw that the 4th and 5th were Saturdays and Sundays, and there were football matches in Hong Kong, so I telegraphed everyone to rush to Hong Kong to participate. As for the four Malayan players, Cai Wenli, Xie Fuqing, Liang Li'an, and Lin Ziquan, they also wrote to report that they will take the Jinma to Hong Kong to participate in the preselection competition. As for Li Yuxin from Java, there is still no news, and I don't know if he will be able to come to Hong Kong. Even if he doesn't come, it won't have any impact.</p>
<p>The Football Captain Has Not Yet Been Decided</p>
<p>Then the reporter asked, "It was previously reported that the foreign specialist football team has decided to appoint Li Huitang as the captain. Is this true?" Mr. Rong replied with a smile, "Regarding this point, I dare to say that the captain has not been decided. In the future, Li may be appointed, but this is not something I dare to decide in advance. Because the official team has not yet been selected, how can there be a captain? Even Mr. Li himself is only a selected player at present. And I dare to be responsible for telling you that this time the National Sports Association is selecting players in an absolutely open manner, not as rumored outside, that it has already been decided. Please think about it, the five selection committee members appointed by the Association, Ma John, Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, Yan Chengkun, and myself, are all neutral and have no private relationship with any players, so in the future, they will definitely act impartially."</p>
<p>Selecting Players Impartially</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Rong, "Did you watch the International Cup football match on Sunday?" Mr. Rong replied, "Yes." Asked, "Did the players perform well?" Replied, "Everyone was excellent." Asked, "The Hong Kong Chinese and Western newspapers said that right winger Deng Guangsen was one of the best players that day. How do you feel?" Replied, "His performance was indeed good that day." Regarding the question of selected players, in addition to the 30 players on the list, do others who have made progress also have a chance of being selected? Replied, "It is natural to be selected, because the official representatives will only select 22 people, and 10 or 8 people will need to be eliminated from the 30 people. However, in any case, the Association will definitely act impartially based on the second method of selection."</p>
<h3>Weak Hope for Shooting Finals, Zhang Yingda Falls Behind, Medina Takes the Lead with 1,000 to 396, Continues the Finals This Afternoon at 5:30</h3>
<p>Under entirely unfortunate circumstances yesterday, Zhang Yingda lost the beautiful technique and reliable experience he usually possessed. He fired 56 shots in the upper and lower halves, scoring only 396 points, while his opponent Medina scored 1,000 points, which can be described as a shocking record in this senior shooting competition, and also a result he has not achieved in recent years. As a result of the first day of the finals, the Portuguese Medina has already taken the lead by 604 points, so it will not be difficult for him to reach the final 1,000 points in the last two games today, and the championship throne will undoubtedly belong to Medina. However, runner-up Zhang Yingda still intends to make a final struggle and will never give up his right. The competition will start at 5:30 PM and the second half will start at 9:00 PM, at the Wan Guo Sports Association.</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The first half ended in an hour and a half. Zhang Yingda once raised his eyebrows in the first six shots, but after that he was always dejected, spending his gloomy life. He scored a total of 168 points in thirty shots. Medina had great luck. The eight shots from the seventh to the fourteenth shots were his most proud masterpieces, scoring 172 points. With a solid foundation, he could shoot with confidence and control everything as he wished. The first half totaled thirty shots. Medina averaged 17 points per shot, with a score of 500 to 168 points.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>The second half started at 9:00 PM, and Mr. Zhang was still unable to rally. Although it was more impressive, it was still far from his usual performance. Medina's shooting method was more lively and fluent than in the first half. After all, he was in the lead and his arrogance was naturally different. He completed the number of 500 points in 26 shots, while Zhang Yingda scored 228 points, less than half of his. The results of the two games on the first day were Medina with 1,000 points and Zhang Yingda with 396 points.</p>
<p>Two Giants</p>
<p>Medina (Upper Half) 25, 49, 35, 86, 65, 35, 48, 26, 26, (Lower Half) 64, 47, 85, 49, 32, 57, Zhang Yingda, (Upper Half) 20, 28, 26, 38, (Lower Half) 35, 20, 34,</p>

In addition, Gu Shangjin boarded the train in Suzhou. Dai Linjing also traveled with them, but was not seen at the station until the train was about to depart. Therefore, yesterday, a group of twelve people, led by Spike of the West Union, departed from Shanghai for the north.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Art Education Promotion Association Sends Telegram to the Ministry of Education to Withdraw its Order, and Schedules a General Meeting for the 18th</h3>
<p>After the promulgation of the revised curriculum standards, art educators in this city specially organized the Art Education Promotion Association and held a committee meeting the day before yesterday. The chairman was Zhao Weizu, and the recorder was Zhu Zhiwei. Zhu Zhiwei was elected to draft a telegram to the Ministry of Education to withdraw its order, and a letter was sent to art teachers in primary and secondary schools in this city to solicit participation. A general meeting was scheduled to be convened on the 18th of this month to discuss the next steps. The original telegram is as follows: (omitted above) According to reports, the revised curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools will reduce the teaching time for subjects such as drawing, music, and manual labor. This may be the result of a temporary proposal by a few people without in-depth exploration. As far as I can see, I think it is inappropriate. The purpose of subjects such as art is to cultivate the body and mind and enlighten the spirit, which is closely related to moral, intellectual, and physical education. Whether we emphasize vocational education or production education, we must not neglect them. Moreover, any career must have a fulfilling life before it can be pursued. How can we make life fulfilling? It is impossible without art. Some say that the society is in a slump, foreign aggression is imminent, and the people will be uneasy and the country will be insecure. The only way to save the situation is to promote science. Therefore, the art curriculum is greatly reduced. I also think it is not right. Any discipline must have sufficient creativity and thinking ability before it can make progress and make inventions. How can we develop creativity and enhance thinking ability? It is impossible without art. Therefore, some provinces advocate art education, and education experts have researched and believe that the teaching hours of subjects such as art should not be less than one-fifth of the total. These are the results of decades of educational experience and dozens of thorough and careful explorations. The importance of subjects such as art can be generally seen. Now, the Ministry has a unique proposal to reduce them. I don't know what it is based on. It is really puzzling. Perhaps it is because it has been nearly thirty years since our country increased art education, and the achievements obtained are minimal, and the effectiveness of the art education curriculum is small, so it is based on this that there is a proposal to reduce it. It is not known that the promotion of art education in our country in the past was all empty words. There was only its appearance, and most of the school authorities also violated it secretly and reduced it privately. It is naturally not easy to seek satisfactory achievements in this way. The shortcomings of the past are there, not here. The Ministry should deeply investigate its source and seek ways to remedy it. If another order is issued to reduce it, it will be a loss of the original intention of promotion. The colleagues of this association are in their duties and dare not remain silent. We hereby send a telegram to your seat, and we urge you to withdraw your order and maintain the original teaching hours of drawing, music, and manual labor subjects in primary and secondary schools. We also ask you to order all primary and secondary schools in the country to implement them in accordance with the standards, and must not neglect them, so as not to make the students feel spiritually flawed, and the future of culture will be greatly affected. Education is fortunate, the nation is fortunate.</p>

<p>School Survey</p>
<h3>Overview of the French School in Shanghai (4)</h3>
<p>By Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of this strict training can also be explained. First, the main purpose of French education is to cultivate the intellectual development of students as much as possible; therefore, less attention is paid to physical training and social education. However, this extremely training can enable French schools to maintain higher academic standards, which is not the case in schools in other countries. First, after French children have undergone strict training in primary and secondary schools, they will inevitably abuse this freedom when they enjoy individual freedom in college. Fortunately, French children have acquired a habit of engaging in normal and efficient intellectual work in primary and secondary schools, which can balance the tendency to abuse freedom. Third, after French children have undergone this strict training in primary and secondary schools, they can become citizens of the French democratic country when they reach adulthood.</p>
<p>In the French school in Shanghai, there is also a special training, which is to cultivate children with a spirit of international harmony. Although there are children of 26 nationalities in the school, the children of various countries do not have an attitude of mutual hostility or contempt in their daily interactions. According to Mr. Gao Boai, he has been the director of the school for more than 20 years (Editor's note: Mr. Gao was originally the principal of the school. Now, because the school business of the French Municipal Council is heavy, a new education department has recently been established, and Mr. Gao has been transferred to the director of the education department. He often instructs the students of the school that there should be no racial or national prejudices among the students. The training of the elected international spirit has now achieved considerable success, which is something that Mr. Gao is proud of.</p>
<p>5. Freedom of Thought</p>
<p>Although French schools strictly supervise the behavior of students, they absolutely respect the freedom of thought of students. This freedom of thought can not only be enjoyed by French college students, but also by French primary and secondary schools. The methods of cultivating freedom of thought are carried out in two aspects: teachers and students. In terms of teachers, no teacher may promote any political party, ideology, or religious opinion in the classroom. Schools may not support a certain party, exclude a certain faction; persuade to believe in a certain doctrine, attack other doctrines; do not promote religion, nor oppose religion. In short, schools absolutely respect freedom of thought and belief.</p>
<p>In terms of students, students are free to express their personal thoughts and beliefs. However, his expressions must be rational and biased towards research, not blindly supporting or excluding a certain party or doctrine. Teachers can of course try their best to revise students' homework and articles, but they should try their best to preserve students' pure rational and research-oriented thoughts and beliefs, and should not add or delete them based on personal preferences.</p>

<h3>Approaching Easter   Foreign Merchants and Banks Settle More Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the money market was unremarkable. Chinese merchant banks were also average. However, due to the doubling of imported goods, foreign and Japanese banks faced an increase in the demand for foreign exchange. As a result, merchants from various industries enthusiastically engaged in foreign exchange transactions. Yesterday, there was an increase in special foreign exchange transactions and telegraphic transfers. From our understanding, telegraphic transfers amounted to over 700,000, special transactions exceeded 900,000, and merchandise loans amounted to over 2 million (most of these merchandise loans were converted to foreign exchange and settled abroad). Various advance drafts, collateral, and miscellaneous payments totaled between 2.3 and 2.4 million. Other foreign bank draft settlements also increased to over 4.1 million due to the opening of customs on Monday. It is also reported that with the foreign Qingming holiday approaching, all important settlements were expedited in advance. Therefore, foreign banks settled more compared to Chinese merchants. As for Chinese merchant bank draft settlements, they remained similar to last Saturday, at over 3.9 million. Various merchandise, exchange, tax, collateral, and miscellaneous payments totaled over 5.4 million. Telegraphic transfers amounted to 700,000. Japanese banks settled over 3.1 million in drafts, over 1.8 million in various merchandise loans, over 1.7 million in advance loans and miscellaneous payments, and 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, special exchange amounted to over 10,000. The amount of banknotes issued by Chinese banks was over 1.4 million for the local area and over 500,000 for other areas. The recovered secret mark coupons were also even more. Money houses and foreign public orders settled over 42 million, foreign drawdowns settled over 4.8 million, various route remittances totaled over 600,000, and foreign collateral transactions amounted to over 500,000 . Chinese banks supplemented long-term (five-day) closing payments over . Most were transferred to current accounts, with only settling. The interbank overnight rate was reduced by 1 point to 8 points, the same in the morning and afternoon. Overnight draft transactions amounted to over 3.5 million in transfers and over 600,000 in cash transactions in the morning session, and over 400,000 in the afternoon session. Transactions at the Small General Association amounted to over 500,000. The conversion rate of coin currency in the black market was reduced by 1 li from the previous day, to 12 points, while the large plate remained at 833.3 points, with transactions amounting to 65,000 points. There were no transactions in the afternoon. Tong Yuan extended loans of 2,000 cash, to 305,000 cash, with transactions amounting to 10,200 strings, equivalent to 3,400 legal tender.</p>
<p>The total number of bills at the city's clearing house on the 6th was 43,390,583.84 yuan in national currency, including 14,669,157.33 yuan in the clearing house, 25,137,219.22 yuan in transfers, 2,151,414.07 yuan in collections from the money industry, and 1,998,033.22 yuan from others. The interest rate on public order overdrafts by the Bank Joint Standard Committee was 1 jiao per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate on 90-day bank acceptance bills was 1.2 jiao per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Tight Lending is Not the Solution</h3>
<p>This year, the silver and money industry remains exceptionally cautious regarding credit lending to various commercial firms. Aside from selectively lending to long-standing customers from last year, new accounts are largely rejected. According to current surveys, each money house has opened no more than three or four hundred accounts, mostly with frequent transactions, largely adhering to a tight credit policy. However, about ten firms, including Fuyuan, Shun Kang, Dunyu, Tongyu, Chengyu, Ankang, Jintai, Cunde, and Wufeng, can be considered exceptions. Therefore, in this year's general commerce, although cash is not available for goods purchases, a ten-day note is often required as compensation; otherwise, the deal will be rejected. As the deadline for the quarterly settlement approaches, efforts should be made to remedy this situation.</p>
<h3>Securities   Large Public Bond Investors Maneuver Opportunistically</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market remained stable, and investor sentiment was calm. With the Tomb Sweeping holiday of four days starting on the 10th, neither long nor short positions were eager to take new positions, and most on the trading floor had largely settled their transactions. Although the environment was shrouded in heavy fog, obscuring clear insight, it was difficult to stimulate fearful investor sentiment. However, whenever a significant amount of selling appeared on the trading floor, large investors would buy in, as if waiting for an opportunity to move, with a neutral attitude. Yesterday morning's opening saw a demand for Bond No. 5. However, as bonds from No. 14 were to continue issuing, the market price was weakened. In addition, Bond No. 16, a previous buyer of Class A bonds, suddenly turned to selling, causing the market to weaken by one or two jiao. The secondary market was soft with minimal fluctuations, and both Class B and Class C bonds failed to open. The continued issuing of Class A bonds from Bond No. 16 caused further declines of 2.5 and 3.5 jiao. The rally seen last Monday proved fleeting. The afternoon opening saw the market trend become chaotic, fluctuating between one-fifth of a jiao. However, Class B far-month bonds were slightly triangular, and Bond No. 5 still saw demand at closing. Although Bond No. 35 saw selling, the market was relatively stable, and Class A bonds slightly recovered by around one or two jiao. With the holiday approaching, market sentiment was idle, and significant changes were unlikely. The resulting high and low prices of yesterday's market saw Class A and Class B bonds down by one to four jiao, and the remaining were slightly weaker. The total trading volume was 1,995,000 yuan. The opening price of China Bank shares was at 74 yuan per 10 shares. The resulting gains and losses are listed in the table below (unit: yuan; trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Rebound Again</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that yesterday (4th), the New York stock market advanced. Auto stocks and steel stocks rose particularly strongly due to good production news. Railroad stocks and utility stocks rose slightly. Small exchange stocks were quiet. The bond market was firm. Half-day trading volume was 1.01 million shares.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton   Depressed by Weak Sales   Declining Trend of Auctioned Yarn Difficult to Reverse   Major Investors Once Rallied   Finally Retreating</h3>
<p>The yarn market started strong, then weakened, with an unusually mediocre trend, generally revolving, while actual yarn sales became increasingly stagnant, with no activity from any party, thus lacking market interest. Major investors tended to buy, supporting market prices, and the industry outlook turned bearish.</p>
<p>Auctioned Yarn Initially Rises, Then Falls</p>
<p>The auctioned yarn market opened in the morning due to the lack of downward movement in overseas yarn and cotton prices, combined with stagnant demand in the spot yarn market and scattered investor sentiment, with declines of 3, 4, and 5 jiao across all months. After the second session, Run Kang Chen sought to take in plates and inflated the atmosphere, which was revived, and the third closing jumped 4, 5, and 6 jiao. In the end, each month rose by 1, 2, and 3 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening continued the firm and bullish atmosphere from the morning, and continued to rise. After entering, heard the spot yarn transaction was bleak, and all parties had no development news. The closing of the third grade yarn fell slightly, and people's sentiment was lazy. As a result, the price of each month compared to the morning closing price fell .2.3.4.5.6 jiao. Check the sale of Juxing 550 bags, Da Feng 1150 bags, He Xing 600 bags, Geng Feng 500 bags, Shen Ji 900 bags, Sheng Yuan 450 bags, Da Ji 950 bags, Da Chang Cheng 350 bags, Yi Chang 1000 bags, Xin Cheng 850 bags, purchased Da Fu 550 bags, Tong Ji 750 bags, Ren Feng 800 bags, Run Kang 3550 bags, Shen Ji 1000 bags, Chang Feng 450 bags, Sen Kang 400 bags, one-day maximum and minimum prices and closing prices listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Sparse</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that buyers purchased only 354 bags throughout the day. The selling price was normal. The purchase volume for each group is as follows:</p>
<h3>Narrow Range of Cotton Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning, but the range of fluctuation was very narrow. As overseas cotton showed a stagnant trend, and spot cotton consumption stalled, most cotton merchants were selling in anticipation of declines. However, the banking community was said to be holding on to large amounts of chips.</p>
<p>Auctioned Cotton Suddenly Injected by Run Kang</p>
<p>Auctioned cotton opened in the morning due to the dullness of the US cotton market, falling by 1 to 5 pounds. Indian cotton rose slightly by 0.5 to 1 rupee. Da Gu third grade cotton fell 2 to 3 jiao. Market sentiment was sluggish, and each month showed a downward trend. The May contract broke through the 5 yuan mark. After the second session, Run Kang suddenly came with a large amount of injection, and the buying appetite was very strong, and all the floating chips on the table were completely collected by him. From the second and third sessions, the market turned from weakness to firmness. As a result, only the current month was uniquely, due to Tong Ji continued purchase, and the distant months were stable. After the second session, due to the weakness of the yarn market and the bearish news of US cotton tomorrow, the market state was relaxed. As a result, each month compared to the morning closing price fell 5 to 1 jiao. Check the 1100 dan, Shen Chang 2500 dan, Tai Chang 1700 dan, Yi Chang 1600 dan, Tong He 2900 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 1800 dan, Yong Chang 1000 dan Xin Cheng 2500 dan, buy Shen Ji 1700 dan, Tong Ji 1400 dan, Da Fu 1300 dan, Tong Ji 1400 dan, Ren Feng 4900 dan, Run Kang 9000 dan, Xie Cheng 1000 dan, and the one-day maximum and minimum prices and closing price examples.</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is extremely sparse</p>
<p>Current cotton consumption is exceptionally deserted, with demand stalled at various factories. Source Yao cotton 200 bales, Tong cotton 100 bales,</p>
<p>Solid cotton 54.00 Yu Feng factory enters 4 sets of imitation goods, delivered directly to the factory</p>
<h3>The Bombay Cotton Market is Firm</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the listing of Roxi cotton, two-thirds of Sura and Nasa Lee cotton have also been in the upper Indian market. Few pay attention to Western cotton. Export transactions are quieter in Japan. The mainland and Lancashire are not urgent, but China has gradually made progress. Spot activities are firmly grounded. Looking at the general trend, it is very strong. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousand bales)</p>
<p>Third Grade Yarn and Cotton Slightly Fall</p>
<p>The Osaka telegraph on the 6th Third Grade Futures Yarn fell 1 to 7 jiao Near month 193.40 yuan, distant month 194.30 yuan Futures Cotton fell 35 to 6 jiao Near month 62.65 yuan distant month 60.07 yuan</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea   The Local Silk Market Returns to Quiet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai silk market has been rather dull lately, with few transactions. European, American, and Yokohama silk prices have all retreated. Although Dachang, Lianna, and other firms have received overseas accounts, the buying and selling prices are vastly different, resulting in few transactions. White factory B grade 20-22 denier is priced at 710.00 yuan, down 10 yuan from before. A few dozen packages in Qili were traded at prices that were livelier than before, but there is no sign of a price increase. Silk factories are mostly traded, and there is no improvement.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Tea Industry Also Knows Improvement</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Wuyuan tea industry has been declining due to the sluggish sales of Russian farms. The main reason is that the harvesting period of Wuyuan green tea is near the beginning of summer, which leads to coarse branches and large leaves, with more old grass and fewer tender tips. Now the Russian route is completely hopeless, and this coarse-leaf tribute green tea is not sold. However, ignorant tea households still do not pick tender leaves early. It is understood that the Wuyuan Tea Industry Association deeply feels that if the green tea in this area is not actively improved, it will inevitably be naturally eliminated. It is heard that they have formally established an improvement agency and are striving to improve the various methods of technology and baking. In particular, they believe that early picking of tender leaves is the key to survival. In addition to sending personnel to various villages to spread the word, they also plan to petition the government to strictly prohibit the sale of old tea.</p>
<h3>Grains   New Wheat Harvest Expected   Futures Flour and Wheat Both Fall</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the weather was clear, gentle, and extraordinary, and there was good hope for the new wheat harvest. Moreover, the quoted prices of foreign wheat from abroad also continued to step down. People on the market were all panicked and bearish, and foreign customers had flattened domestic and foreign wheat markets, so the hoarding stomach was sluggish, and flattening was even healthier. Therefore, after the opening, all months, near and far, stepped down uniformly, especially the distant month new flour standard was the softest. In the near term, due to insufficient inventory, customer conversion was still active, so the market was relatively stable, but it was also affected by the downward trend of the far term.</p>

<h3>Anhui Tea Research (1)</h3>
<p>— Shi Jifa</p>
<p>(1) Tea Producing Areas, Types, and Output in Anhui Province</p>
<p>Anhui is rich in products, with tea being the most prominent. Its soil is fertile, and its processing is excellent, so it is sold throughout the country and exported to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia, all with high praise. Although other provinces in China, such as Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, also produce tea, they cannot compare. Anhui is the richest tea-producing area, with almost every county north and south of the Yangtze River producing tea. Tea produced north of the river is collectively called "North Tea." Tea produced south of the river is collectively called "South Tea." The green tea produced in Lu'an and Huoshan counties in northern Anhui is famous throughout the country, while the black tea produced in Qiupu (Zhizhi) and Qimen in southern Anhui is renowned overseas. The so-called "Hui-Lu'an Famous Tea" has a long history. Researching its historical origins, green tea began in the Wei and Jin Dynasties and flourished in the Tang and Song Dynasties. The tea industry began in Qiupu. Thirty-seven years before the founding of the Republic of China, a man named Yu from Yi County opened a black tea factory in Yaodu Street, Qiupu County, to test the production of black tea. The following year, he went to Qimen to set up a branch factory, encouraging tea farmers to use fermentation and other methods. In the third year, he opened a black tea factory in the western district of Qimen. At the same time, Hu Yeru, a wealthy tea farmer in the southern district of Qimen, specially made garden tea to promote it. This was the beginning of the conversion of Anhui tea to black tea. Since then, the number of black tea factories has increased year by year, and Qiupu and Dingzi counties have become areas in Anhui Province that produce black tea.</p>
<p>Anhui has a vast tea-producing area and a very rich output, with more than twenty counties involved. The province's tea-producing areas are now divided into five categories as follows:</p>
<p>Various counties under Huizhou Prefecture: Huizhou was formerly a prefecture in Anhui Province. The six counties are located in southern Anhui, bordering western Jiangxi, western Zhejiang, and the Shapai River. The area is mostly mountainous, with little plains, so agricultural products are centered around tea. In the past, transportation was via the Xin'an River and the upper reaches of the Chang River and Leping River, with Tunxi and Wuyuan (now under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province) serving as hubs for the concentration of grains and tea leaves. Wuyuan, Dingzi, Qimen, Xiuning, and She County produce the most tea, and their quality is the best in Anhui. Both red and green tea are available. Yi County's Xuxi also produces more than one million dan per year. In total, Huizhou's annual tea output accounts for a large proportion of China's tea exports. Among them, the black tea produced in Qimen is mostly concentrated in the inland areas of Jiangxi Province. Other areas mostly produce green tea, with Wuyuan producing the most, accounting for half of Huizhou's green tea. Therefore, Huizhou tea is also known as Wuyuan tea, and because it is concentrated in Tunxi, it is also known as Tunxi tea. Xiuning and She County produce the second most, and Yi County's Xuxi produces less. In addition to being exported by foreign firms, Anhui tea is also sold in Jiangsu, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, and other provinces and cities.</p>
<p>Jiande and Qingyang counties in Chizhou: Both Qingyang and Jiande counties in Chizhou are under the jurisdiction of the old Chizhou Prefecture in southern Anhui. They also produce tea, but the quality is inferior to that produced in Huizhou, and the output is not much. In addition to self-sufficiency, very little is exported. It is not often seen in Beijing and Shanghai, but it can also be found in Fuzhou and Wuhan markets.</p>
<p>Lu'an's Yingshan, Huoshan, Shucheng, and Huoqiu counties: All belong to northern Anhui, and they are known for their scented green tea, such as Jin Chun and Jiang. This kind of tea is mostly sold in the Shanghai market, followed by Wuhan, and also in Fuzhou. A large amount is also sold to foreign firms, with an annual output of no less than hundreds of thousands of boxes. Lu'an is one of the tea distribution centers in northern Anhui. Every tea season, many Shandong merchants come to the market with handcarts, stay in tea shops, and purchase large quantities of tea, which they resell in Shandong via intermediate routes. (The tea season is from late April to early May).</p>
<p>Fengyang and Shouzhou counties: Also belong to northern Anhui, and both produce tea. The tea produced in Shouzhou is called Shouchun tea, which is excellent. Many Shanghai people use it because of its fragrant taste. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Red Eggs</h3>
<p>— Yao XingShu</p>
<p>— Here's Why You Might Not Get to Eat Them —</p>
<p>Chicken eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, Gaoyou salted duck eggs, spiced tea eggs—gentlemen with plenty of legal tender in their wallets can always buy and eat them. But red eggs are different. Unless "my precious" has just been born, they're not easy to come by. It's truly a case of "searching high and low without success, then getting them without any effort."</p>
<p>Society's custom is that only when someone has a son or daughter do they feel overjoyed and send red eggs to relatives and friends. Only then do others get to eat red eggs. Hence, "When are we eating red eggs?" has become a humorous catchphrase circulating in society.</p>
<p>It is said that my Lord Jesus had no father. His mother, Mary, conceived through the Holy Spirit of God and gave birth to Jesus. Who is God? What is the Holy Spirit? I am a humble scholar and dare not offer reckless opinions, so I'll leave that aside. Modern knowledge tells us that to have children, a man and a woman must cooperate intimately. However, there are many men and women who live together for a long time but cannot conceive. When they will eat red eggs is utterly unknown, truly causing people to long with aching eyes.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of fertility, I, an astrologer, have done much research. Whether one can conceive or not can be known on the spot simply by charting a woman's birth data and predicting a man's yearly luck. Whether it's accurate to speak of the past and predict the future, you'll know on the spot if it's accurate, and you'll know afterwards if it's effective. "You have no descendants... At twenty, childless, you laugh merrily; at thirty, childless, you hang your head low." The reason for infertility is very simple: "It's fate, it's luck, what more can be said?"</p>
<p>"Medicine," "divination," "astrology," and "physiognomy" have been known as top-tier professions since ancient times. I humbly acknowledge my ignorance, having only learned "medicine." I'm a complete layman when it comes to the study of fate, a total simpleton who doesn't understand. However, although I'm a poor doctor, I've always been keen on pursuing principles. The reasons for infertility, from a medical perspective, require much investigation. Readers are all clever friends, so let's see, who's right? Who's wrong?</p>
<p>Before getting to the main topic, I must first speak up for young women.</p>
<p>China is a male-centered society, where women are always at a disadvantage—no, that's not entirely true now—and infertility is also blamed on women. In reality, women are only half responsible for fertility. If a woman and a man live together for years without conceiving, she is immediately labeled an infertile stone woman, which in ancient times was grounds for divorce. Now, although the law doesn't allow it, men still use the excuse of taking a concubine to prepare for passing on the family line, which is perfectly justifiable. This is truly killing people! Those innocent, abandoned women, how wronged! How wronged! You must know that not all men are all-powerful in fertility. Even if an infertile man takes hundreds of concubines, it won't do any good.</p>
<p>In short, to have sons and daughters, there must be sexual intercourse, and sperm must unite with an egg. If either of these processes is obstructed, then no matter how much you burn incense day and night or worship Buddha, even sincerity won't work. Now, I will explain the medical causes of infertility below for your consideration.</p>
<p>(A) Inability to have intercourse</p>
<p>If a man's penis has congenital abnormalities, is abnormally small or excessively large, or is partially damaged due to external injuries or various diseases (including venereal diseases), or is surgically removed, or has scar-induced contractions, or due to surrounding diseases such as inguinal hernias, hydroceles, elephantiasis, etc., the penis may be able to erect or barely erect, but due to one of the above-mentioned obstacles, it cannot achieve its purpose. In medicine, this is called organic disorder of the penis.</p>
<p>Organic disorders of the penis always have clues that can be found; but the functional disorders of the penis that I'm talking about here are different. Outwardly, they look impressive, but they are weak and incompetent, unable to erect, or the erection is weak. These symptoms are seen in patients with neurasthenia, diseases of the brain and spinal cord, excessive debauchery and masturbation, and sexual perversion. These so-called impotent men can only sigh in vain before being cured.</p>
<p>The female vagina is used to accommodate the penis and receive its ejaculated semen. If this part undergoes changes, congenital or acquired abnormalities, such as vaginal closure, narrow vaginal opening, fused labia, tough hymen, scar-induced vaginal constriction, if this path is blocked, it will cause obstruction. This is called organic vaginal atrophy in women. In addition, although the structure of the vagina has not changed at all, many women with mental disorders and hypersensitivity, as soon as the penis approaches the private parts, the vagina immediately experiences high spasms, resulting in the male being unable to ejaculate. There is also a type of woman who, due to various environmental factors, is usually depressed and unhappy, indifferent to human affairs, and has extremely weak sexual desire. The secretion of the cervical canal glands is scarce, and the sperm ejaculated by the man cannot survive for long in the acidic vaginal fluid, losing the opportunity to unite with the egg. Although "that" has happened, it is still not easy to conceive. This is called psychogenic vaginal atrophy in women.</p>
<p>(B) Narrowly defined infertility</p>
<p>A man's only reproductive ability is sperm, which is produced in the testicles. If the testicles are diseased, do not produce sperm, or the sperm has lost its vitality in the testicles, or the sperm cannot be discharged due to blockage of the passage, etc., then one cannot have children, but the matter of sexual intercourse can still be done hard and practically.</p>
<p>Congenital absence of testicles is a type of malformation. Because it cannot produce sperm, it is absolutely impossible to have children. If one side is missing, there is still hope for fertility.</p>
<p>If the testicles do not descend into the scrotum but remain hidden in the abdomen or inguinal canal, they cannot fully develop, the tissues atrophy, and they cannot produce sperm.</p>
<p>If the testicles are removed or exposed to X-rays, they lose the ability to produce sperm.</p>
<p>The testicles atrophy and their function degenerates due to masturbation and excessive sexual activity, orchitis, epididymitis (mostly caused by gonorrhea), etc.</p>
<p>Testicular syphilis, tuberculosis, tumors, etc., cause the function to disappear.</p>
<p>Lack of sperm.</p>
<p>Semen (in which sperm float) is obstructed from being discharged due to foreskin, vas deferens scar contraction, tumor compression of the vas deferens, etc.</p>
<p>(C) Female inability to conceive</p>
<p>In this item, the male bears no responsibility. Conception requires the union of a female egg and sperm. If a woman's ovaries do not produce eggs, the fallopian tubes are blocked due to disease, there is a congenital lack of ovaries, or there are diseases of the ovaries themselves, as well as diseases of the uterus, etc., the site of egg production, the path it passes through, and the incubator for the embryo have changed, so naturally conception cannot occur.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, there are many reasons for infertility. Which side, male or female, should bear more responsibility? The statistics from various sources are inconsistent, but it doesn't matter, so I'll skip it. It's not to please women or speak up for them, but they may not bear more responsibility for infertility.</p>
<h3>A Global View of Tuberculosis Statistics (4)</h3>
<p>— Ding HuiKang</p>
<p>The mortality statistics for countries in North America vary greatly. For example, a 1926 report from New York State showed a difference of 1.48 to 50.0 deaths per 10,000 residents. It is difficult to study such differences. Michigan, located in the central part of the northern United States, had fewer tuberculosis deaths between 1901 and 1926 than the southern states, but Michigan's population is very dense. This decrease may be due to the influence of foreign residents or the presence of many sanatoriums in the south. In general, the greatest reasons for the decrease in tuberculosis deaths are the development of industry, the improvement of living standards, and the efforts of tuberculosis prevention. According to Green's report, in Cleveland, there were 14.6 deaths in 1910 (per 10,000 residents), but only 8.3 deaths in 1930 (per 10,000 residents). People of color, whose living standards have not been fully improved, do not seem to be able to achieve this reduction in tuberculosis deaths.</p>
<p>In Mexico, tuberculosis mortality has also decreased in recent years. Although Mexico City often has various unfortunate incidents, in 1900 there were 50.0 deaths per 10,000 residents, but in 1929 it had decreased to 13.0 deaths. Funding for tuberculosis prevention comes mostly from charitable donations.</p>
<p>In South America, Argentina and Brazil reported tuberculosis deaths in 1926, and the mortality rate was still very high due to poor public health. The Philippines has a 30-year history of tuberculosis prevention, but it has not yet achieved its goals. In 1926, there were 29.27 deaths per 10,000 residents, 28.76 deaths in 1928, and 30.55 deaths in 1930. In 1904, 18.43% of cattle had a positive tuberculin reaction.</p>
<p>The situation in Japan and China is similar to the above. However, it should be noted that the mortality rates in each region are different. According to Mr. Peng, there are fewer cases of tuberculosis in northern and western China, and more transmission in central and southern China. China's tuberculosis prevention facilities were first initiated in 1913. Mayor Wu and others recently initiated the China Tuberculosis Prevention Association, which has now established several clinics. Detailed work reports should be available soon to satisfy readers' desires, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, USA, the mortality rate among Chinese and Japanese residents is 45.9 per 10,000 people, while among other ethnic groups it is only 9.93 per 10,000 people. These observations are quite surprising, as the aggressiveness of tuberculosis seems to vary among different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>When discussing tuberculosis from the perspective of race, special attention must be paid to the place of growth. For example, the tuberculosis mortality rate among blacks and Indians in Canada, the United States, and Mexico is generally extremely high, while the mortality rate among whites in the same location is much lower. In addition, the mixing of blood, i.e., interracial marriage, may increase resistance and reduce tuberculosis mortality, but it does not reduce its contagiousness. Mr. Grouch has definitely proven that between 1926 and 1930, there were 132.7 deaths per 10,000 residents among Indians, while there were only 33.9 deaths among whites. Most interestingly, one-third of all Indian deaths occurred around the age of fifteen. In addition, Mantoux's tuberculin test was 75% positive in Indian children, 34 to 39% in mixed-race children, and 22.6% in white children. The high rate of infection among these Indians is clearly due to poor hygiene.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q&amp;A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng HanZhang</p>
<p>(80) Pernicious Anemia</p>
<p>What is Pernicious Anemia?</p>
<p>This is an independent type of anemia. The disease progresses continuously; it is not caused by external influences such as blood loss, poisoning, or inappropriate lifestyle.</p>
<p>What are the causes of pernicious anemia?</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>There are many causes of pernicious anemia. The main ones are toxic effects in the blood or hematopoietic tissues, or poor hematopoietic function in the body itself. Other causes include tapeworm infestation, syphilis, pregnancy, etc., but generally it is due to toxic effects.</p>
<p>Is the occurrence of pernicious anemia related to age?</p>
<p>Pernicious anemia occurs more often in middle age (35 to 50 years old) and later. But it sometimes occurs in adolescents as well.</p>
<p>Is pernicious anemia related to gender?</p>
<p>It is more common in women.</p>
<p>What are the initial symptoms of this type of anemia?</p>
<p>The onset of pernicious anemia is insidious, so it is impossible to know when it started. But in the beginning, the patient feels tired, muscle fatigue, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, increased heart palpitations, loss of appetite, nausea, pale skin and mucous membranes, sometimes burning sensation on the tongue, diarrhea, lack of gastric acid, and neurological symptoms.</p>
<p>What symptoms develop later?</p>
<p>Later symptoms include pale skin and mucous membranes, retinal hemorrhage, or optic neuritis, rapid breathing, increased heart rate, anemic heart murmurs, digestive disorders, belching, lack of appetite, constipation, enlarged spleen, dark brown urine, sometimes containing protein, and often mixed with urobilinogen. There is an abnormal sensation in the hands and feet, lower limb ataxia, increased tendon reflexes, and the body temperature rises slightly every afternoon. The mucous membranes of various parts are prone to bleeding.</p>
<p>What changes occur in the blood of patients with pernicious anemia?</p>
<p>The blood is pale, watery, slow to coagulate, and the serum is dark yellow. The number of red blood cells is reduced, with only 1.5 million or even less than 1 million per cubic millimeter. Hemoglobin is also reduced. White blood cells are fewer than normal, and lymphocytes are increased.</p>
<p>How long does pernicious anemia last, and what is the prognosis?</p>
<p>It lasts for a long time, from six months to a year, or even more slowly, up to ten years or more. The disease is severe, and if not treated properly, it is difficult to avoid death.</p>
<p>What is the treatment for pernicious anemia?</p>
<p>A relatively new method for treating pernicious anemia is liver therapy, which involves eating animal liver or liver preparations every day, and injecting liver preparations such as Campolon, Livex, and Hepracton. The second is to inject arsenic preparations and take Asiatic pills and Arcylen pills internally. In addition, blood transfusion therapy is performed, and digestive agents such as dilute hydrochloric acid and pepsin are taken internally for poor appetite. Non-specific stimulation therapy, such as the injection of casein and milk preparations, can also be tried. Some people advocate splenectomy, but this cannot be done. (End)</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou MengBai</p>
<p>Platycodaceae</p>
<p>(1) Balloon Flower Platycodon grandiflorum, DC.</p>
<p>"Plant" Grows wild in the wilderness and can also be cultivated. It is a perennial herb. The stem is 60-90 cm tall. The leaves are alternate, petiolate, lanceolate or oblong, with serrated edges. In summer and autumn, it blooms with purple or white five-lobed bell-shaped flowers. The capsule is spherical.</p>
<p>"Cultivation Method" Sow in seedbeds in spring, and transplant to the main field in late autumn. For layering, space the rows two feet apart and each plant six inches apart. The following spring, when new shoots grow to about one foot tall, add soil to the base of the roots to prevent lodging. Use human manure and oil cake as fertilizer. The harvesting period is from November of the fifth year after sowing to March of the following year. When harvesting, dig up the roots, remove the stems, wash off the dirt, and dry them in the sun. Each mu can yield about 370 catties of fresh roots. Autumn roots are best for drying Balloon Flower.</p>
<p>"Crude Drug" Balloon Flower Root Radix Platycodonis is collected from the roots and dried. The product is spindle-shaped, 10-15 cm long, 3 cm thick, curved and branched, and uneven in size. The surface has longitudinal deep wrinkles, similar to yellowish-brown, and the texture is rough. The fracture surface is fibrous, white or light yellow. The taste is bitter.</p>
<p>The cross-section of the root is irregular in shape. The outer periphery, with a curved outer layer, is covered with a dark brown tegument. The inside is white. The thick part of the bark is roughly the same as that of the wood. There are cracks everywhere. The cambium is along the brown ring money. The sieve tube and vascular bundle are in the shape of brown radial lines.</p>
<p>Examining the cross-section under a microscope, the bark is purely composed of parenchyma tissue, with stone cell nuclei, but no mixed fibers. In the secondary bark, there are multiple latex tubes, and the vascular bundles are arranged in a row.</p>
<p>Dried Balloon Flower is the root that has been peeled of its tegument and dried. The surface is similar to white, and the texture is light.</p>
<p>"Ingredients" The roots contain Kikyosaponin C29H48O11. When this Saponin is mixed and boiled with acid, it is hydrolyzed as follows: C29H48O11+H2O=C23H38O6+C6 (Galactose)</p>
<p>Japanese scholars such as Mr. UmeTsuji and Mr. Ohluka have done considerable research on the Saponin of this plant.</p>
<p>"Pharmacology" The Balloon Flower Saponin obtained by Mr. UmeTsuji exhibits complete hemolysis in a 10,000-fold solution. The Balloon Flower Saponin obtained by Mr. Ohluka is even more potent than the former. The lethal dose of Balloon Flower Saponin for mice is 7.7 mg of subcutaneous injection for mice weighing 10 cm.</p>
<p>"Medicinal Use" Old sayings: Balloon Flower root is used as an expectorant and for throat diseases. The daily dose is 8 grams, used as a decoction, but licorice is often added.</p>
<p>Prescription Example: Balloon Flower Decoction, has the effect of expectorant and cough suppressant.</p>
<p>Balloon Flower 4.0 Licorice 8.0</p>
<p>The above is a decoction of 200, taken in three divided doses a day.</p>
<p>New Drugs: New drugs made from Balloon Flower root are as follows.</p>

<p>(84) Vitreous Opacity</p>
<p>The vitreous body is a colorless, transparent, gelatinous substance. It is in the posterior part of the eyeball. It fills the vitreous cavity surrounded by the lens, ciliary body, and retina. Its shape. Is slightly spherical. It also has refractive power. The front is connected to the lens. The contact part is concave in the shape of a dish. The vitreous body itself has no inherent nerves or blood vessels. Its nutrition is supplied by the adjacent uvea. Therefore, the vitreous body is also often affected in diseases of the inner eye membranes, such as retinitis, choroiditis, and ciliary body inflammation.</p>
<p>Speaking of the causes of vitreous opacity. Most are caused by syphilitic or tuberculous uveitis or retinochoroiditis. Others occur after acute infectious diseases, severe myopia, retinal detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage. The degree of opacity is not the same. Some exist throughout the vitreous body, some are localized to the anterior or posterior part, or some are scattered individually. The shape of the opacity varies. Fine ones are like dust. Slightly larger ones are like dots, flakes, filaments, plaques, and membranes. These opacities often cause visual impairment in patients. When the patient's eyeball moves. There are dark spots floating in the field of vision. Like mosquitoes flying in the evening in summer. This is what is called floaters. If we use transillumination to examine. Most are easily seen to be opaque. In the red pupil collar. There are black or grayish-white opaque or translucent dust, dots, flakes, filaments, plaques, membranes, and other opaque substances. If the patient moves the eyeball up and down or left and right. Then the opacity can be seen floating in the eye. If combined with vitreous liquefaction. Then the movement of the eyeball is not necessary. It is also possible to observe the floating of opaque objects.</p>
<p>The first thing to do in this disease is to treat the underlying disease. Try absorbent and conduction therapy. Pay attention to the state of systemic nutrition. If it is syphilitic, it is especially suitable to implement anti-syphilis therapy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when healthy eyes are staring at a white wall or the sky. Often there are translucent droplet-like, flocculent, or filamentous dark spots. This is because of the cells and connective tissue fibers remaining in the vitreous body during the fetal period. In medicine, it is specifically called physiological vitreous opacity. Moderate myopia is more likely to occur. There are four characteristics of this opacity: 　The number of dark spots is approximately constant and does not often increase. 　The dark spots are mostly fixed and do not move, but when the eyeball moves, they also move with it. 　The patient's vision is not impaired. And 　If examined by transillumination, it is often impossible to prove the opacity.</p>
<p>Physiological vitreous opacity often does not require treatment.</p>
<h3>Tooth Knowledge Q&amp;A (27)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 132) Why should mouthwash be selected and prepared by a doctor?</p>
<p>Answer: Because everyone's oral condition is different, and special oral conditions should use special mouthwash. For example, people with excessive acidity in their mouths are prone to tooth decay and should use more alkaline medicines to neutralize the acidity. If there is too much alkalinity in the saliva, tartar accumulates, and it is easy to develop periodontal disease, then alkaline medicines should not be used too much. Generally speaking, most people suffer from acidity in their mouths.</p>
<p>(Question 133) The mouthwashes sold on the market are mostly expensive. Are there any cheap and good mouthwashes that can be prepared and used regularly?</p>
<p>Answer: There are two types: The first is lime water. Just buy dozens of coins worth of quicklime, dissolve it in water, let it release heat and settle, filter out the clear water on top, and store it in a bottle. Or store the water and the settled lime at the bottom together in a container. After the water on top is almost used up, add water again. This way, you can always have a saturated amount of lime water to use. When using lime water to rinse your mouth, you can add some warm water to avoid the taste being too strong. The second type is physiological saline, or 1% saline. When preparing it, just use one part salt and 100 parts boiling water. These two types are indeed the easiest to prepare, the most economical, and the best mouthwashes. Families should keep them on hand and use them from time to time. If saline is mixed with a small amount of lime water, the effect will be even better. Lime water can also be added to milk for children to drink, which can help with milk digestion.</p>
<p>(Question 134) How should people with excessive acidity in their mouths protect their teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: People with abnormal saliva and excessive acidity in their mouths are prone to tooth decay and are extremely sensitive. Local relief seeks to neutralize the acidity in the mouth. The following drugs can be used:</p>
<p>(1) Baking soda: Use a small spoonful of baking soda and mix it with a teacup of boiling water. Rinse your mouth often, once after meals and before going to bed.</p>
<p>(2) Lime water: As mentioned above, it can be used for regular mouthwash.</p>
<p>(3) Milk of magnesia: Use it after brushing your teeth, at least once every night before going to bed. Take a spoonful of milk of magnesia, pour it into your mouth, and use the movement of your tongue and cheeks to spread it on the surface of your teeth. This method is very effective.</p>
<p>(4) Tooth powder made of calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate also has the effect of neutralizing acidity.</p>
<p>(Question 135) What are the harms of tartar?</p>
<p>Answer: The nature of tartar has already been discussed in questions 88 and 89 above. It has many harms. First, it can irritate the gums, gradually causing redness, swelling, and inflammation, easily leading to bleeding and even suppuration, becoming periodontal disease. Second, it is the main base for oral bacteria to reside, causing tooth decay, stomatitis, and a breeding ground for pharyngitis. Third, it accumulates thicker and thicker, the gums recede due to pressure, and the roots of the teeth are exposed, making them prone to looseness. Fourth, it can damage the aesthetics of the teeth, covering the white teeth with various dirty colors.</p>

<h3>Blessing and Curse</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The Bishop of St. Paul's Cathedral in London held a grand public prayer meeting the night before last to bless those in various countries who bear the heavy responsibility of the current situation. King Edward VIII of England and his staff, French President Lebrun and other cabinet members, German leader Hitler, and other important administrative officials of various countries were all named. However, it is heard that this is the first time that Mr. Xi has been included in the public prayer of the English church.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation in Europe has been turbulent, causing people to be panicked and fear the impending disaster. Therefore, churches in various countries often pray for peace, hoping that the merciful God can have mercy on the suffering of the people and turn misfortune into blessing for the world. The year before last, when the Chaco War between America and Bolivia was in full swing, on the Savior's birth day, the church appealed to both sides to cease fire for one day, so that the warriors on the battlefield could also receive the Lord's blessing and rest. On the same day last year, when Italy and Ethiopia were confronting each other in East Africa, the church made the same request. Once, the Pope of Rome even held a large peace prayer meeting, ordering Catholics around the world to pray continuously for three days. This is a manifestation of the charitable spirit of Catholics. Unfortunately, no matter how much they pray, human catastrophe is still unavoidable. The great war in East Africa killed and injured countless lives. This is probably the will of heaven, which cannot be saved by human power. Otherwise, the prayers of Catholics must be sincere and devout.</p>
<p>This time, the Bishop of St. Paul's Cathedral in England probably saw the ineffectiveness of previous peace prayers, so he changed his approach and blessed the current political leaders of Europe. This intention is also very good. Those important officials who are prayed for happen to be in this great era, bearing the heavy responsibility of the current situation. It is really too hard, and they should be prayed for, begging God to bless them all with good health so that they can seek peace and tranquility for mankind. Mr. Xi has never been included in the public prayer of the English church. This time, I think it is because he is considered to be pivotal to the European situation, so he is also blessed once.</p>
<p>However, the attitude of ordinary people is different from that of Catholics. They often utter curses against some political leaders in various countries around the world. The reason is that these big figures mostly have a kind of ambition. On the surface, they never tire of saying that they love peace, but in reality, they are all scheming against each other, preparing to slaughter. They yearn to achieve a heroic career under their own iron fist. The turmoil in the world today is all caused by them. And the fate of mankind is held in their hands, at their disposal. They are so headstrong, taking their own will as their will, so naturally everyone will not have any good feelings towards them.</p>
<h3>"Chaotian Restaurant"</h3>
<p>— Guo Ka</p>
<p>——Travel Notes</p>
<p>It started snowing when the car left Jinan. Pressing my forehead against the cold glass, I looked out the window. The flickering electric lights gradually disappeared, and my eyes were filled with a vague wilderness. The light in the car quickly brushed past the slopes by the roadside through the window, and the ground gradually turned white. In the light and shadow outside the window, there were also snowflakes shaking and flashing, or tiredly sticking to the window glass, turning into water droplets and flowing down in curves.</p>
<p>I turned around in disappointment and let out a light sigh into the carriage, where most of the passengers were already asleep. The journey of the past few days, suddenly encountering such snowy weather, made me feel a little apprehensive about the journey tomorrow.</p>
<p>After midnight, in a burst of commotion, I opened my eyes from my sleep. Someone on the platform outside was shaking a bell and shouting in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"Weixian Weixian..."</p>
<p>I groggily grabbed my luggage, got off the car, and rushed out of this small town station.</p>
<p>It was three o'clock in the morning. In the shadows, several people surrounded me to grab my luggage, while shouting the names of some small inns. After my luggage was snatched by someone, I followed him to the second floor of an inn. He led me into a large room. In this room, there was a row of long bunks along one side, and two single wooden beds. A traveler who looked like a small businessman also seemed to have just arrived. I quickly washed my face and went downstairs to the accounting room to ask if the bus would run as usual tomorrow. The boss, smoking a water pipe, showed a professional smile and said:</p>
<p>"If it doesn't snow anymore, this little bit of snow won't be a problem."</p>
<p>But if it snows again, it's hard to say! So I worriedly kept pushing open the window to look at the snow. The snow was falling wildly, without any intention of stopping. Under the window was a rickshaw, and a mule standing in the snow was constantly ringing the small copper bell on its neck, making a kind of melancholic sound.</p>
<p>When I woke up in the morning, it was already bright. I quickly pushed open the window. The snow seemed to have stopped, but the sky was still the same. I turned around and ran downstairs, but I bumped into my roommate. He said:</p>
<p>"It's okay, the car can't run today, we're all on the same road."</p>
<p>I went back and briefly talked to him for a few words. Then I realized that he was a regular customer of this small inn, always running back and forth on this road. After talking for a while, he said:</p>
<p>"Let's go, let's get something to eat. How about Chaotian Restaurant? It would be a pity to come to Weixian and not eat Chaotian food!"</p>
<p>"What is Chaotian food?" I asked inexplicably.</p>
<p>"Try it and see? It's a specialty of Weixian."</p>
<p>So I followed him curiously and aimlessly. At this time, it started snowing again. In the muddy ground, the semi-circles trampled by mules were filled with pools of snow water.</p>
<p>Pulling open a greasy door, we stepped into a room with a strong oily smell. In the center of the room was a boiling pot, surrounded by a circle of red wooden pot stands, looking just like a big hot pot placed on a small round table. Because the weather was cold and it was still early, the room was deserted and there were no customers. Even the owner of the store ran out from the back room after we called out a few times. As soon as the boss came out, he grinned his greasy face and said:</p>
<p>"You came at the right time, the meat just came out of the pot!"</p>
<p>Following my friend's example, I sat down on the small lacquered stools scattered around the pot stand. The boss immediately put two bowls and two pairs of firewood-like chopsticks. Several wooden spoons were hanging on the edge of the pot. My friend picked up one and scooped the oily soup floating in the boiling pot of meat into his bowl, then scooped another spoonful and brought it close to his mouth, slowly sipping it twice, before putting down the spoon and saying:</p>
<p>"Give me a little bit of everything, I want the fatty kind, especially more fatty intestines."</p>
<p>After speaking, he turned to me and asked:</p>
<p>"What about you?"</p>
<p>"Give me some liver." I said casually.</p>
<p>The boss cut a portion, put it in a colander, and boiled it in the surging pot. Then he picked up a large, thick cake, rolled the meat in the cake, and handed it to my friend in a rough manner. I felt a strong interest and took my rolled cake. I sipped some soup and felt a little "unable to handle it", but the cake rolled with liver was good, very satisfying, and with the addition of green onions and pickles, it was even more flavorful, quite like the style of Liangshan heroes!</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>While eating, I spit out a question from my mouth full of cake:</p>
<p>"Why is this called Chaotian Restaurant?"</p>
<p>The boss lifted his apron and wiped his greasy hands and replied:</p>
<p>"That's because in the early years, they were all opened on the street, with the pot mouth facing the sky. Now most of them are in the house."</p>
<p>My companion, chewing on a mouthful of cake, mumbled:</p>
<p>"It's also called offal pot, and some people also call it gluttonous pot, haha!"</p>
<p>A few crumbs of cake and spittle stars sprayed out with my companion's laughter.</p>
<p>After eating, I took a cup of dark red tea from the mud pot and poured it down in one breath, then I exhaled the onion smell and stepped onto the snowy street.</p>
<h3>Old Clerk</h3>
<p>— Shu Mang</p>
<p>The faint sunlight shone on the window glass of the silent office. In a stream of sunlight like water, countless dust particles could be seen moving. Everything seemed so dead and so gloomy. Stationery cabinets, desks, files, ledgers... Everything that constantly disturbed and frightened people's minds was neatly arranged, like coffins in a funeral home. In the midst of these things, people, for the sake of life, buried their energy, their youth, their hopes, and their laughter so plainly and silently...</p>
<p>Secretary Wang raised his head from a page of neat regular script documents, put down his pen, relaxed his old, sore, and somewhat numb arms. The heavy mind made him feel a kind of nausea close to his heart, and the only stream of sunlight flowing into the room from the window also pricked his eyes: in front of him seemed to be a pitch-black mass, but in this pitch-black mass there were chaotic, disturbing, and miscellaneous colors. He helplessly blinked his eyes, leaned back in his chair, and tightly held his hands together, his hands dripping with cold sweat.</p>
<p>"After all, as I get older, it's really not working..."</p>
<p>Indeed, Secretary Wang really felt himself getting older day by day. A man in his fifties, copying tens of thousands of words of neat regular script every day in a dark and sunless corner! That has been nineteen years! Nineteen years! What a long time! For the sake of his wife, children, and old mother, for the salary that never exceeded fifty yuan a month, he buried his past years for nineteen years! And now, the burden of life is still heavy, but he can only carefully keep this job. Nineteen years! Former colleagues, now, have relied on their "skills" and other people's "connections" to rise to high positions, but he, even after nineteen years, near the age of sixty, is still a "Secretary Wang" making fifty yuan a month, with no "skills" and no "connections". However, he is unable to support himself day by day, getting older day by day—in the past few months, superiors have successively discovered many mistakes in the documents he copied. He was called in by his superiors, who said in a mocking tone, "You are really too tired, at such an old age..."—but the burden of life is heavy.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Secretary Wang felt a little moisture in his dry eyes, and he was miserable. A line of life's sorrow, like fierce liquor, pierced straight into his heart. He slightly opened his eyes, wiped them with a towel, took a breath, and picked up the cold and hard pen, dipped it in ink, and used the habit he had developed for nineteen years, carefully and cautiously, writing down one word at a time; "Check..."</p>
<p>In the quiet night, the door slammed open, and a messenger walked up to Secretary Wang and said in a low voice: "Mr. Wang, Section Chief Lu wants you to go right away."</p>
<p>Thinking for a moment, "Don't tell me I made a mistake somewhere again...?" Thinking so, he blankly put down his pen and followed the messenger out.</p>
<p>This time, Section Chief Lu seemed particularly polite: "Mr. Wang, you must be very tired... Yes, the work here is really too hard. Mr. Wang has been here for...?"</p>
<p>"Nineteen years, Section Chief."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, nineteen years, even longer than my seniority, admirable, admirable, you should be called a veteran, shouldn't you? Hahahaha... How old is Mr. Wang this year...?"</p>
<p>"Fifty-eight."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, for nineteen years, Mr. Wang has been working here, and the results have been very... We admire it, but I see that Mr. Wang is getting old, and excessive labor makes us very uneasy. We are thinking of Mr. Wang... so... so... here is... please take a look..."</p>
<p>He handed over an envelope. Secretary Wang took it and pulled it out to look: it was a letter of dismissal!</p>
<p>Suddenly startled, Secretary Wang was stunned. "What was coming has finally arrived." All sorts of complicated questions could no longer be thought about. Stumbling out of the gate, the sun on the street still shone brightly.</p>
<p>He calculated that he had not seen the sun on a Monday morning street for nineteen years...</p>
<h3>People Who Failed in Life</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>In the living room of the inn, I accidentally met a distant relative who was in the business of green fruit canning in the town. In the past few years, every time I went home and passed through Songzhen, if I had time, I would go to his shop to see him and his wife. At that time, it was the peak of his "business boom". His nose was originally red and shiny, and people called him "Red Nose Duke". He was also good at talking. At that time, a kind of spirited and high-spirited demeanor was often revealed on his red and shiny nose. This unexpected meeting tonight, under the bright and dazzling gaslight, I took a brief look at him. He was wearing a set of old clothes and a tattered overcoat. That most noticeable red nose seemed to have faded away from its former spirited and shiny color, becoming rather shabby. He seemed very happy, calling out my name. I let him sit down in the room. After exchanging greetings, the two began to talk.</p>
<p>He began by complimenting me on my "glorious return", which made my face flush again and again. The conversation shifted to the situation of the market. At this time, he was almost the only one who spoke. He sighed, shook his head, and repeatedly said that business was getting worse every day. Without cash to pay, the goods from above could not be moved. Even with the goods, they could not be sold. Although there were more "foreign guests" than in previous years, they were all "wax ducks" with only enough money for transportation. The last time he settled the accounts, he couldn't pay, so he sold the only three acres of paddy fields in his family. Then he talked about a whole set of family disputes. He looked like he was about to cry.</p>
<p>At this time, he took a sip of tea and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>——I really didn't expect that my fortune would decline to this point! You don't know, it was earlier this year, I shouldn't have married that "Tiger Woman" behind the back of my wife. At that time, I said that there were also two or three acres of paddy fields in the family, and there should always be someone to manage and watch the house, but I didn't expect today...</p>
<p>It turned out that he had married a woman at home behind the back of his first wife. When his business failed and the fields were sold out, he couldn't afford to provide her with living expenses every month, forcing the woman to come to the store to make a scene. Now, all the money in and out of the store is controlled by the first wife. The woman couldn't stand it and went back home.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, I didn't say a word to him. I just felt that this was the inevitable fate of a ruined petty bourgeois. I sent him out at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, I got up to prepare to take the bus to Kaixian County. When I rushed to the station, the bus was about to leave. Just as I took a seat, I turned around. Outside the bus window without glass, a head suddenly pushed in. He apologized and wanted me to say a word to him. In a secluded corner on the right side of the station, he timidly took out two large oranges from a large satchel and stuffed them into my hand. Then, with his left hand, he handed over a paper package and whispered into my ear:</p>
<p>—Here are fifty cents, please give them to her for me, and tell her for me...</p>
<p>Saying this, he turned his head, looked around, and said again:</p>
<p>—You are a well-read and enlightened person, please tell her for me: "If you want to leave, just leave. If you don't want to leave, it's up to you. But I can't afford to support you in the future. You can choose one of the two paths." Finally, he urged me to keep it a secret for him.</p>
<p>The horn sounded. I held the oranges in one hand and a package of silver coins in the other. Thinking of this man's failure, that woman's future, my heart felt like I had eaten something greasy, just feeling extremely stuffy.</p>
<p>The car was already bumping forward on the steep mountain road. (Miscellaneous Notes on the Return Journey)</p>

<p>The Road of Life</p>
<p>Hua Ruonan - Unwilling to be used by her father as a commodity for promotion and fortune, she left her family and fled to Shanghai alone. It is of course very difficult for a woman without money to live in Shanghai. She is unwilling to work in a factory and be teased by the foremen and small clerks, and she is unwilling to be a vase in a company or shop. She wants to be a female teacher but no one introduces her. She submits articles to various newspapers, but she doesn't know anyone in the literary world. In this helpless situation, she owes money to the rice store and two months' rent to the landlord.</p>
<p>Mr. Mi from the rice store came to collect the rice money. In the end, he had no choice but to return.</p>
<p>Miss Fang, the landlord's daughter, came to ask for the rent on behalf of her mother, saying that it must be paid today. Ruonan told her to wait for the money to be sent from home and she would give it to them immediately. Miss Fang would not allow it. Miss Fang also said, is it possible for a woman to have no way to make a living in Shanghai? As long as you are willing to be a little casual, isn't it easy to make some money? Ruonan was sad enough to hear this. She told her that she had already sold her soul and body twice in order to live... Her father received a report from Ruonan's cousin. He and her brother—Guoying—came here to ask her to go back! And marry that Commander Chen, but Ruonan refused to go back with her father! She resolutely refused to be Commander Chen's concubine and let her father use her as a commodity for promotion and fortune.</p>
<p>While the two sides were arguing, Ruonan's lover—Yifeng—came to find her from Hankou after receiving the information. Seeing this situation, he stopped her father and brother from taking Ruonan home. Suddenly—Ruonan said that she had been a slave woman and had sold her soul and body twice because of the pressure of life. Her father was so angry that he fainted and no longer wanted Ruonan to go back. The affection between father and daughter was gone at this time. Instead, the father scolded her and left with Guoying without looking back!</p>
<p>At this time, Ruonan completely realized that the reason her father wanted her was not because of the love between father and daughter, but completely because he wanted to use her as a commodity!…</p>
<p>Yifeng told Ruonan that we can only struggle and fight to live!</p>

<p>Opening "Spring Boudoir Song"</p>
<p>Little peach blossoms cover the Shanglin Garden. The Su Causeway in the spring dawn, willows sway with gold. The color of the willows on the road is as green as can be. Rain hits the banana leaves, the doors are deeply closed. Butterflies in love fly as spring departs. Falling flowers and weather are of most concern. Deep in the boudoir hangs a beaded curtain. Birds startle and chirp, protecting the fallen petals. That Liu Niang was thrice drunk on Yang Guifei's couch. A dual-toned hatred for this unfaithful man. He and I, we first met at the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. Long willow threads tie our hearts together. He loves me, the peacock spreads its screen with beautiful colors. I love him, riding a horse with a whip is a prince. We made a vow of mandarin ducks at West Lake. It's like, a pair of butterflies flying back and forth frequently. At times, peach and plum blossoms compete for spring, leaving beautiful shadows. At times, we recite poems in old age, advising literary pursuits. Who knew, that the drunken old man's attempt to catch the moon would be an empty hope. Hating that the Eastern Emperor's four seasons are not constant spring. A sudden thunderbolt on a clear day. It's just like, swords rising in the east. He is defending the nation and the people, traveling to Shanghai. Suddenly singing the Yangguan Three Stanzas. Thrice drunk before the wine cup, bidding farewell at the long pavilion. I wish him, to return early with the dragon boat race victory. Double phoenixes facing the sun, drunk in peace. We are happy and enjoying peace and prosperity. Who knows, that spring returns to the small garden, but he has not returned. The wild goose falls on the sandy beach, with little news. How can a patterned brocade be delivered? The parasitic plant's traces have no roots. Now the round fan weeps in the autumn wind. It's more miserable than Zhao Jun's resentment. The candle shadow sways red in loneliness. The sound of waves and the shadows of plum blossoms sigh in drifting. The hate is deeper than the Qu River of Xiao and Xiang.</p>

Listening to the sound of the night watchman's clapper and drum. Lazily. Intent lingering. Glad to see the courtesan returning drunk. Her cheeks are flushed with wine. Helplessly, the jade sleeves droop down. The procuress supports her, delicate and weak. Beauty hides her shame, unwilling to raise her head. The procuress happily claims there are guests. The beauty is drunk and cannot accompany. On the bed, her starry eyes are blurred and sleepy. Qin Zhong is. A long night accompanies the fragrance. Immediately takes a towel to personally receive the vomit. Calls for tea and humbly offers a cup of dew. The golden rooster awakens her from a dream of immortals. Asking, who is this gentleman. Little maiden. My name is Qin Zhong, selling oil. Last spring I saw you and admired your talent. Accumulating money for a good meeting. Last night I chanced upon you returning drunk. Respectfully receiving your vomit. Quickly taking clothes to accompany you. The beauty listened and said it was rare. Thanking you for your kindness and apologizing for the trouble. Qin Zhong is indeed sincere and serious. Thank you for your kindness and talent. Cautiously asking when we will meet again.</p>

<h3>Pan Yuzhen Returns Home with Praise, Performing at Carlton Starting Wednesday</h3>
<p>The Pan Yuzhen Art Troupe, which once performed at the Shanghai Nanjing Grand Theater, was ordered by the government to go abroad to participate in the Chicago World's Fair competition before the year, and was greatly praised by the people there. They continued to perform at Broadway in New York and other places, breaking any record of Chinese opera troupes in the United States. This art troupe, with Yuzhen, Yujie, Yurong, and Yulan as the pillars, also has a warrior Su Fu and more than twenty other actors, each with unique skills and performing very seriously, so their reputation can shake overseas. They have now returned to China, and it is rumored that they will perform at the Carlton Theater starting on Wednesday, and it is expected to cause another sensation. In order to particularly please the audience, the theater will also show the martial arts epic "Hero on Horseback" at the same time.</p>
<h3>"Peaches and Plums Compete for Beauty" Lead Actress Ye Qiuxin</h3>

<p>Female stars opening silk shops and crowning dance queens, this was popular two or three years ago. It seems like without doing this, it was impossible to increase their "reputation." Following this, it was probably "when things reach their peak, they decline," and most female stars were ashamed to participate in these boring activities. Therefore, people said that this was the female stars' awakening, a commendable phenomenon.</p>
<p>Is it the female stars' awakening? What is the explanation for the recent Gu Meijun and Gu Lanjun participating in the opening of silk shops, and Yuan Meiyun crowning the "Queen of Flowers"?</p>
<p>Wang Tingshu, who played the clown in the Lion Roar Society's "Death of a Famous Actor," received good reviews for a while. It is said that this gentleman did indeed play a clown in the North before, so it is no wonder that he played it so well.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that the clown gentleman has joined the Shanghai Theater Academy with Chen Ningqiu, and there are four others who have joined together. It seems that the Lion Roar Society is likely to merge with and be under the command of the "theater senior" Xiang Peiliang.</p>
<p>Chen Ningqiu once told people that his joining the Shanghai Theater was like entering a big hotel, at least he wouldn't have to worry about food and lodging in the future.</p>
<p>Someone invited Wei Ling to join the Shanghai Theater, but Wei is still considering it.</p>
<p>Shao Zuiweng came to Shanghai reportedly wanting to "wholesale" some dancers to Nanyang, has the Cantonese sound film failed again? But after the "wholesale" of dancers fails again, what "business" will Boss Shao do?</p>
<h3>Small Records of Lianhua Filmmakers</h3>
<p>Yin Xiucen used to be a small factory owner, he knew how to make guns and artillery, but he didn't know how to make bullets.</p>
<p>Cinematographer Huang Shaofen used to be an actor. In "Love and Duty," he played the brother of Chen Yan Yan, who had the same mother but not the same father.</p>
<p>Ma Xuweibang is a painter. For a period of time, he relied on painting for a living.</p>
<p>Zhang Weitian, who writes subtitles, has been in the Chinese film industry for almost twenty years, but he has never been on camera once. According to him: "If I stand in front of the camera, I get dizzy as if someone is pointing a gun at me."</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang, the director of "Waves Washing Sand," and Xu Ke, the set designer of the film, were classmates at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
<p>Before entering the film industry, Liu Jiqun was a student at Soochow University in Suzhou.</p>
