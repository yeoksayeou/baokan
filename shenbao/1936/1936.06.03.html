<p>— 都</p>
<p>自日軍擴增部隊陸續開向華北以來久苦局脊之平津人士愈益增其杌揑之情况神經銳敏者殆無時不惴惴於非常事變之突作蓋以今日之華北大局呈亂絲之棼治權等朽索之柔實不堪再以嬰寗之餘生遭驚濤之衝激顧一方則忍辱負重强顏爲歡一方則盤馬彎弓撫髀思動瓶罍之恥且勿之論偕亡之懼寗能自禁迨二十九日北寗路炸軌案發生而陰霾沉沉之故都遂更爲恐怖之氣所籠罩有岌岌不可終日之勢矣</p>
<p>炸軌事件之發生各方傳說頗多矛盾疑翳重重未易猝辨在眞相未經調查明確以前對於此事之責任問題吾人亦殊不欲輕加論斷惟當入心浮動之際舉措略一乖方每易召致意外今茲之事卽其一例故日方以增兵爲護僑之藉口吾入則祇覺增事態之糾紛今姑勿復侈陳主權之被侵卽就石井所宣稱者而論「華北當前要事在於安定人心農商樂業」然事實上釀成目前嚴重之局面極度之不安者果又孰致之耶</p>
<p>外國報紙對於炸軌案之紀載類多以華北危局爲標題或則追述瀋案認日方又將有大舉而倫敦自由黨新聞紀事報評論此事率然以爲「北寗路發生炸彈案竟與一九三一年瀋陽附近路軌被炸一事如出一轍前此炸案結果滿洲大部份土地卽爲日本軍隊所佔領此决炸案適發生於華北日本增兵計劃完成之日事之巧合有如是者」以前後對此之言詞發微妙不盡之論調絃外之音寗待傾吐其實炸軌一案事屬局部損失旣極輕微性質宜不重要然而外國報紙之口吻如彼當地人士之恐慌如此緣何結想成此默喩亦豈非懍於過去之體騐聳於當前之步驟遂不自覺其鰓鰓過慮歟</p>
<p>今平津當局已明白表示其應付時局之態度矣對內尚團結對外主和平如此委宛之立塲宜足消對方之疾視而日軍發言人對炸軌案之聲稱尚日「若繼續調查後而發現日軍尊嚴感受影響時則日方當訴諸强有力之手段」匣劍帷燈之語抑何咄咄逼人吾人欲知炸軌案所反映於華北大勢者如何亦唯有靜觀今後局面之展開而已</p>

<p>— 余井塘</p>
<p>緒言</p>
<p>江蘇省政府於二十三年春制定江蘇省限期禁烟辦法大綱、規定一般烟民限於四年內分期禁絕而對於　染有烟癖之公務人員、則一律勒令於一個月內戒絕、是年夏省府會議通過　江蘇省禁烟委員會組織章程、設委員十一人、其下設秘書一人、內分　總務査緝牌照稽核四課、各課設課長一人、以主持全省禁烟事宜、各縣亦設縣禁烟委員會、以縣長爲委員長、亦置秘書一人、分總務査緝牌照稽核四股、各置股長一人、此省縣禁委會　組織之大槪情形也、在省縣禁烟委員會組機　下推行禁政者凡一年有三月、洎二十四年八月　復遵照蔣委員長訓令、將禁烟事務分爲監察與執行兩部、監察機關爲省縣禁烟委員會　省執行事宜　則由民政廳添設第五科辦理、縣執行事務交縣政府　添設禁烟科辦理、而一切禁烟法令規章仍循其舊、務使行之有效以臻如期繁絕之目的、荏苒迄今又將十月、茲値二十五年六三　禁烟二週年紀念、爰將前後辦理經過、撮要陳述於次、</p>

<p>二　設立戒烟院所</p>
<p>本省於二十三年開始辦理禁政時、卽籌設各縣戒烟院所、是年十月於省會設省戒姻醫院一所、兼辦鎭江戒烟事宜、開辦費爲三千五百元、經當費月爲二千元、同時爲研究戒烟與調騐之標準　方法起見、又於省立醫院附設研究部、聘請專家專司其事、其他六十縣、亦於二十三年十一月間　先後成立戒烟所各一所、開辦費平均每所一千五百元、經常費　平均每所每月五百元、嗣以各縣戒烟所收容投戒傳戒勒戒　及調騐烟毒人犯、平均每所每月的在一百五十人以上、原有病床儀器藥品　及其他關於施戒調騐娛樂方面　設備、尙不敷用、愛經査照以地方實際情形、分別予擴充、現計全省戒烟院所容量、可以同時收容烟民五千三百二十七人、每月以兩批計算、可以收容一萬零六百五十四人、又本省以各縣地方經費支絀、縣立醫院、尙未普通成立、其已成立者、亦有內容設備尙未充實、爲普遍地方醫藥衛生起見、經通令原有縣立醫院　之設備已較爲充實者外、應一律於戒烟所內　附設內外科診療部、所需開辦經常各費、卽以戒烟收入撥充、現訐已成立者共有　丹陽揚中等十七縣、正在積極籌備者計有賓應等三十縣、</p>
<p>三　烟民傳戒</p>
<p>本省領照烟民、人數衆多、戒烟院所勢難一决收容施戒、爰經依據限期禁烟辦法大綱、規定施戒年度、施行有計劃之分批傳戒、於民國二十三年十月一日開始實行、分期四年、限定每年至少須戒絕登記烟民總數四分之一、至分批施戒之先後標準、規定年在三十歲以下者、重遲於第一年度戒絕、三十一歲至四十歲　於第二年度戒絕、四十一歲至五十歲於第三年度戒絕、五十一歲以上　於第四年度戒絕、上項規定、如一年度內不足四分之一時、應將决年度應戒　烟民提前傳戒、凑足四分之一、同年度應予傳戒之烟民、其分批先後　及提前之標準如下、一、年齡較少者在前、二、年齡相同以吸量較淺者在前、三、年齡吸量俱相同者由縣决定之、每批傳戒烟民名單、至遲須於兩星期前公吿、並分別通知、一面報省備査、領照烟民、一經傳戒、其所持之執照、應自傳戒之日起、失其效用、逾期抗傳不到、應予拘案勒戒、本省烟民　依照傳戒程序自二十三年十月　開始傳戒、除因死亡或遷移無從傳戒者外、截至本年四月份止、總計共戒絕烟民九萬四千二百二十四人、又四月份正在　施戒烟民二千五百二十八人、</p>
<p>四　烟民訓練及救濟</p>
<p>依照本省禁政現狀、業已做到統制管理烟民、依限施戒誠無所難、惟入所受戒者是吾具有誠意、戒絕出所能吾不再復吸、烟民體質皆孱弱不堪、又多窮苦而無吿、戒後如何救濟、均成爲重要問題、爰於二十三年冬　製訂烟民訓練方案、去年又確定烟民儲蓄烟民工廠等　辦法、以謀補救、訓練方案分知識訓練、個別談話、精神講話、身體鍜鍊、勞作、反省、自治訓練、娛樂等項、其中知識訓練、個別談話精神講話　由各縣禁烟委員會委員、其他機關人員、及所長醫師等任之、至於生活救濟則由江蘇農民銀行　訂有獎勵烟民儲蓄辦法、又由省分區設立烟民工廠、自去年四月起先後　在南通銅山鹽城各區各設工廠一所、（鹽城尙未完全成立）、此項工廠規模較大　需費較多、一時尙未能普遍設立、此外武進成立烟民習藝工塲一所、鎭江成立烟民感化所一所、（未完）</p>

<p>— 中國徽主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之二十七）</p>
<p>一，五金業之沿革及範圍</p>
<p>滬市五金業之歷史，向無確實之傳述。除銅錫器皿作業，始於同治年間外；所謂五金業，迄今不過六十餘年之歷史。據云最早係攤販性質，迨葉澄衷氏開設老順肥五金號後，（當時亦稱食物五金）滬市漸有五金業之名稱。茲後因世界礦冶工業之進步，出品繁多，而花色亦日新月異，因是五金業之範圍，逐漸擴大。迄至今日，上自一切建設原料，下至門窗戶牖，瑣碎用具，莫不包括在內，業務日趨複雜，因而業內有按商品種類之分別。</p>
<p>普通所謂五金，金，銀，銅，鐵，錫是也。除金，銀中要用作貨幣及首飾業已分離而獨立專營外，其餘銅鐵錫之類在工業上功用甚大，如機器槍砲子彈，建築原料，以及家用什器，無不胥賴於此，尙有鉛，銻，鋅，鎳，雖列在五金之外，然其功用之廣大，不在銅鐵錫之下，故通常皆包括在五金業之內。至就營業範圍大小而言，該業又可分爲下列數種？之一，鐵行業—販賣建築用之鋼鐵條，板及生熟鐵塊等品。</p>
<p>二，大五金業—經售建築金屬村料，如鍍鋅鐵片，馬口鐵，鋼條，等品。</p>
<p>三，小五金業—買買路礦廠局金屬品，及日用零量雜件，如刀，銷，彈簧，鉸鏈等品。</p>
<p>四，銅錫業—專營五金礦產原料，如銅，錫，鉛，銻，鎳，鋅，及製造發賣銅錫家用之器皿等品。</p>
<p>除上述叫種外，尙有製造機器附售五金另件者，謂之機器五金業。以經營玻璃爲主，附及瑣細五金者，謂之玻璃五金業。製造車輛上應用之五金附件者，調之車料五金業。承裝水電工程，而有水管，龍頭等金屬品出售者，謂之電料五金業。買賣玻璃器皿，經售家用烹煮金屬用具者，謂之吃食五金業。出售建築上裝璜品如地毯，漆布，油毡浴缸等及五金另件者，謂之雜貨五金業。收賣廢舊五金各品者，謂之舊貨五金業。綜此以觀，可見五金業範圍之廣大。但滬市之稱五金業者，係指鐵行，大五金，小五金，及鋼鍚四業而言。此外雖有金屬品之經營買賣，非純粹之五金業也，（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c173">消除烟禍與改造生活 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>—轉録禁烟拒毒擴大宣傳週演詞—</p>
<p>普林文忠公有言曰：「鴉片之毒，甚於洪水猛獸。天下萬世之人，斷無有以鴉片爲不必禁者，……此禍小除，十年後，不惟無可用之兵，並無可醫之餉。」鴉片流毒內地，如痣疸流毒人身：今則烟禍流毒，豈僅十年，且將百年矣。烟禍之烈，想無人不深知之；即彼已染烟癖者，亦何嘗不深痛而疾惡之。顧何爲而百年以來，愈禁烟而烟禍益復彌蔓；即靑年有爲之士，亦竟不能目禁於烟毒之侵染乎？此固由於以往禁烟方法之不澈底，不周密，不嚴厲；然考其最根本的原因之所在，實由於一般國民生活之不合理。富有之家，遊惰之衆，平時旣不務正業，不好生產；生活復浪漫不檢，毫無規則，飲食起居，旣無定時，又復沈迷聲色之好，夜以繼日，縱慾消耗，以致精神不足，氣體日損，於是飲酖止渴，侵染烟癖，而無由自拔。故消除烟禍，一方面固應求方法之周密，法令之嚴峻；一方面允應從事國民生活之改造；使國民生活，日臻合理，使舉國人民，體格强健，精神煥勃；根本不復感鴉片之需要。此則爲消除烟禍之根本辦法，而允有待乎新生活運動之積極推進者矣！</p>

<p>— 馬亮</p>
<p>外患日亟，國難未已，吾人於六三紀念，緬懐先賢林公則徐，撫今追昔，衷心能無餘痛乎？蓋林公識見之高遠，料事之深澈，實爲並世不可及。共論鴉片之爲害也，則曰：「甚於洪水猛獸，即堯舜在今日，亦不能不爲驅除。聖人執法懲好，實爲天下萬世計，而天下萬世之人，亦斷無以鴉片爲不禁之理」。「此禍不除，十年後無可甩之兵無可籌之餉」。鴉片之流毒於內地，猶癢疽之流毒人身也，癢疽生則以漸而成膿，鴉片來則以漸而致寇……」。其於禁絕鴉片之辦法也，對外則主張杜絕來源，須由洋商簽具：「嗣後如有夾帶鴉片，貨物盡行沒收，人即正法」之切結；對內則繼黃爲滋之後，首倡用嚴刑峻法有：「斷癮之苦，甚於枷杖徒刑，該犯明知，不肯斷絕，若罪以死論，是臨刑之慘急，更苦於斷癮之苟延……」其於吸戶之戒除也，於人民則用五家運坐法，營兵則用五人互保條規。且先之以矜惜，恐之以刑戮，曉之以禍害，勉之以福利，務使人民知所警惕。其曉論中有：「財爲養命之源，兩等銀錢都非容易，將銀錢換土，可笑孰甚，捨銀錢服毒可哀孰甚……」等醒闢沉痛語，吾人稍以覆按，可見公之觀察透闢，持論嚴正，辦法縝密，痛惡深切矣。是故奉命馳抵廣州後，一時販者吸者，咸爲歛跡，進而迫繳英商鴉片二萬餘箱，於一八三九年六月三日焚燬之，　因芙商逞兇私販不服的束，甚至殺我人民不交兇犯，遂致藉口保僑引起所謂鴉片戰爭，割地賠欵，開五口通商，訂立南京條的，開締結不平等條的之先河，貽國家無窮之大患。先是英艦開粤，林公敵禦，竟不得逞；　各省疆吏因承平日久，躭於安逸，疏於防範，味於大義，罔知團結，重以奸民嗜利爲虎作倀，遂被英軍攻陷浙江定海，以至於失敗。結果，林公遺戍而去，烟禁功敗垂成，公竟賚志以終！吾人於茲六三禁烟紀念之辰，緬懐往事，悲痛彌深，爰將林公簡史，介紹國人，俾資模楷，用當追思。幼年時代——公之身世</p>
<p>公生警敏。軀矮聲洪。娶鄭氏。世業儒，至公則家道式微，養飱恒不繼。四歲即入鄕塾，過目輒不忘，二十舉於鄕，巡撫張帥誠奇之，延爲　賓，盡得刑名大政要訣。二十七成進士，以編修用，至是究心經世之學，歷任江西雲南會考官等職，皆能嚴除科塲陋習，認眞取才，土氣爲之一變。</p>
<p>中年時代——興水利堤工整頓錢漕澄淸吏治</p>
<p>年三十六補監察御史，此後即開始政治生活，舉凡國計民生，罔不顧及，尤以決獄平恕，民頌之曰：「林靑天」，消廉政聲，遐　知名。至京師引見時，宣宗當面獎曰一汝在浙官聲甚好」。即此可見公爲官之廉正。道光三年，躍升按察使，時江蘇患水災，田禾蕩然，公父擬救荒諸策，如勸平縣，放賑品，畜耕牛，殮餓浮，公皆决第行之，蘇民莫不加額稱賀，繼署布政使，聲譽尤隆，未四年公父母先後謝世，丁憂反里，無官身輕，深得家居之閒。迨服闋，屢任布政使，總督，巡撫等顯官，力除河工積弊，裁汰冗員豁免錢糧，整頓漕務，，撫卹流亡諸大政，造福人民實非淺鮮，宣宗嘉之，一年內五易新職，宸眷之隆，可見一班矣。</p>

<p>道光朝，外商運華鴉片，年達三萬餘箱，致金銀外流，民生貧困，朝臣咸主禁止，以塞漏卮，而裕國計，公乃本平日目擊鴉片流毒，詳擬六項禁烟辦法，並力主死刑。蓋以鴉片流毒，至於斯極，斷非常法所能防，且云及「鴉片非難革　，而難於革心，故欲革玩法之心，安得不立怵心之法，使吸烟者有所警惕而自戒除也」。此　旣上，命往廣東査禁，公即於赴任途中，査訪包賣販運護送之奸民，飛剳令廣東當局拘拿。甫下車，老夷商査頓亦先遁回國，而裝運鴉片之躉船，亦將　動他去，公覩此狀，乃諭夷商速繳鴉片，英領英商，迫於勢，始允繳出，前後達二萬餘箱，並令英出具不再販運鴉片之甘結，始能了事。一面則大整軍備，練壯丁修礮臺。繼得庭諭，令將收繳鴉片就地銷燬。乃於一八三九六月三日焚化於虎門，達二十餘日始藏事。適又發生英人擊斃華人事件，復抗不交凶犯，始下令驅逐澳門英人，並斷柴米食物，英領不甘，　礮擊九龍示威，似此兇頑情况，公飛奏京師，至是淸廷乃下諭正式停止英商貿易，對鎖港口，英人頗受打擊，迨英國會議决派艦來華，初向粤閩進攻，由公籌劃痛予懲創頗失利，然斯時國人習於安逸，衆議沸騰，咸謂公輕啟寡端，頗不謂然，鄭夫人雖函勸，亦未能挽回公禁烟之决心，且復信剖明心迹曰：「明知禁烟妨碍奸夷大利，必有困難，而毅然决然不敢稍存畏葸之心者，蓋以身許國，但求福國利民，與民除害，自身生死尙且付諸度外，毀譽更不暇計及」。觀此寥寥數語，可知公痛恨鴉片抵拒侵略堅毅之心矣。英軍攻粤閩旣不利乃改攻定海，遂陷之。蓋是時承平日久沿海空虛，英方深知我國其他各省疆吏昧於時勢，疏於防禦，步伍不齊，團結不力故也；而朝臣懼禍亦歸罪於公，另派琦善赴粵査辦，並諭沿海疆吏，不得輕向外艦開砲起寡，一面仍論琦善備戰。詎知琦善庸懦，一切皆反公所爲。至粵盡撤沿海守備，散壯了，廢水師，一意媚英求和。乃英軍竟來此時機，大舉進攻，淸廷震動，不得已與英締結南京條的，割香港，開廣州五港口通商，並賠欵二千餘萬兀，不平等條的目此發軔。鴉片流毒蓋深入民間矣。</p>
<p>晚年時代——間懇屯田消弭回漢爭端</p>
<p>公書具歐陽，詩宗白傳，居官時無暇題詠，及遺戍伊犂也，始得暢意吟咏兼及書翰，一時人皆賽之。前後留伊　近四年，開墾屯田，的三萬七千餘頃，回民生計，因之大裕。得伊犂將軍奏聞，宣宗乃令署陝甘總督，繼補巡撫，不幸操勞過度，病已深伏此時，迨調雲貴總督，力釋同漢畛域，以德服人，豈斯之謂歟？雲南民風强悍，盜匪充斥，自公到任，寬猛兼施，恩威並用，不數月匪患敉平，人居始得安居樂業。惟公自鄭夫人卒後，傷感逾恒：舊疾復發，遂辭官返里，行前縝民徒香載酒相送，不期而集者數萬人。翌年宣宗崩，文宗即位，會廣西髮匪倡亂，命公往剿，力疾抵潮州，痢下不止，逝於普寗行館，昊天不弔，喪此禁烟元動，一世哲人，遂從　與世長辭矣。公之豐功偉菜，自有千秋，惜於烟禁未竟全功，則當引爲恨事也。</p>
<p>本黨成立以來，鴉片即懸爲例禁　總理且制有拒毒遺訓詔示吾人，惟是二十年來，軍閥割據，環境繁複，致禁政未能收效。今幸我最高領袖　蔣委員長兼任禁烟總監以來，深以烟毒爲息，允勝外侮。此禍不除，民族難期復興，國家地位亦難期平等；是以雷厲風行不遺餘力，且規定六年分期禁絕辦法，及登記檢舉治罪等各項條例以示矜恤，法外施仁其斯之謂乎？吾人深願全國民衆毅然警惕，凜於烟毒爲禍之深，仰體政府除毒務盡之意，共同努力，以觀厥成，庶幾不負，蔣兼禁烟總監與民史始之苦衷，而六三紀念林公，始有眞意義。</p>
<h3 id="c175">本市禁烟問題之商討 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡勁軍</p>
<p>本市自去年奉令辦理禁烟以來，　本中　分年禁絕計劃，切實推行，不遺餘力，究以受畛域上之陣碍，情形特殊，辦理困難，逈異他省，自非斟酌社會情形，確定施禁標準不足以適應環境，而收事半功倍之效，茲將本市禁烟重要問題，略舉數端，以供商討。</p>
<p>一，注重宜傳促起烟民之覺悟我國敎育，尙未普及，民智淺陋，無可譯言，本市下層階級之勞工允爲衆多，對於烟毒之禍害，法令之內容，未易爲全民衆所瞭解，所有各界人士，均應特別注重宣傳，闡發禁烟之意義，如敎育界，應努力於市民之識字敎育，將禁烟問題，作爲敎材，新聞界應提　掣領，發揮言論，指導民衆，從事於拒毒運動，同時社會知議份子，應提倡新生活，使民衆屏除嗜好，養成勤儉撲素之習慣，討於烟毒有深惡而痛絕之心理，凡此諸端，所以增强禁烟力量，端賴民衆與政府合作，共同推行，吾人應知宜傳之目的，在促起烟民之自動覺悟，蓋專以嚴刑峻法，使人民恐懼，而不敢犯罪，不如兼用革心方法，啟其內心之覺悟，而自動戒除，本局自舉辦烟民登記以來，調査所得，本市戒絕烟癮者，的近萬人，其自行戒絕者，佔半數未始非禁烟政策宜傳之力量，嗣後自當集全民之力，加緊宣傳以求烟民逐步减少，而達到限期禁絕之目的。</p>
<p>二，嚴禁私運杜絕烟毒之來源　本市向無烟苗產生，施禁範圍，僅限於運售吸三者，而禁運禁售，允爲重要，蓋私運私售之來源不寒，烟毒决無肅淸之望，本市交通便利，素品易於偷運，不法之徒，往往利用此種機會，密設窟穴，此拏彼竄，防不勝防，施禁困難，達於極點，現方積極檢舉烟毒，自應謀澈底禁絕之法，在政府方面，應由負責查緝人員，研求有效方法，聯合各地及鄰封警務當軸，取同一步驟，協力査緝，各運輸及航行機關，應與査緝人員，切實聯絡，嚴密防止烟毒之運人，並令所屬員工，分別連環具結保證，以免勾結匪人，秘密販運，在民衆方面，應知此輩運售毒品人犯，不但破壊禁政，且爲人類之公敵，凡有聞見各本良心之主張，負責檢舉，並勿以房屋供給製售毒品者犯罪之用，以免牽累，按照以上辦法，如果上下一心，官民合作，則私運私售者，無從施其伎倆矣。</p>
<p>三，廣設戒烟醫院普遍施戒　本市以人烟稠密易於藏垢納汚，而民性又習爲奢廳偷情故沉湎鴉片嗜好者，觸目皆是，允以貧民爲多，本市於二十四年內登記烟民三〇八三三人，其請領貧民執昭者達一七九九五人，較領普通執照超出五千餘人，此輩貧民平時勞力所獲，尙不足以資生活，一染烟癖，决無餘力可以自行戒絕，是以必須廣設戒烟醫院，爲烟民免費施戒，以導引其自新之路，本市現會設有戒烟醫院四所，床位五百五十餘張，而每月所能戒斷者，爲數不過七八百人，除滬南滬北兩醫院，係全部收容自動投戒烟民外，至臨時戒毒所及附設之人犯戒烟醫院，係供本年及特區査獲烟犯勒戒之需，但床位有限，人犯衆多，每感不能普遍施戒，爲增加戒烟之效率起見，本市戒烟醫院，似尙有盡量增設之必要，自應與衛生局及本市各禁烟機關暨特區各級法院，協力籌商，總期於最知期間，有以促其實現也。</p>
<p>四，建設烟民工廠改良烟民之環境　鴉片爲害，足以戕賊人之身體，銷磨人之志氣，多數烟民沾染嗜好以後，　因事業荒廢，不能生產，遂至甘趨下流，無由振拔；迨戒絕以後，復以生活不能安定，或爲環境所誘惑，不旋踵間，又復吸食，即使處以嚴刑，究非治本之法，亟應籌集經費，建設大規模之烟民工廠，收容戒絕烟民，及已經判處罪刑拘押期滿之烟犯，一律令其習藝，練習其技能範圍其身心，銀鍊其體格，庶習藝期滿，惰性全革悉變爲健全生產之國民，匪特於禁政之推行有裨，且於社會治安亦有密切之關係也。</p>
<p>禁烟問題，千頭萬緒，以上四端，不過僅就本市社會情形，略舉其犖犖大者而已，吾人應知烟毒一日不除，則民族一日不振，卽復與之大業，亦一日難期，千里行程，發軔方始，遺大投艱，責在吾輩，願與本市人士共勉之！</p>
<h3 id="c176">中國禁烟與國際 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>禁烟運動，本來只是內政運動，但在咱們中國，却也成了國際運動，一八天九年的中英戰爭，便是爲了中國要禁止鴉片，戰爭失敗，中國政府在英國洋槍大砲的威脅之下，中止了禁烟運動，現在，用槍砲來干涉中國禁烟的醜事不曾再有了，而利用條的上的特殊權力，來破壊阻碍中國的禁烟運動的事，却還存在着，蔣禁烟總監會經很沉痛的說過「巾國各方面的情形，比較特殊，禁烟的事情，如果單靠政府的努力，的確不容易澈底做到，因爲有許多地方，（尤其是上海，漢口，天津各處的租界），以及許多情弊，（尤其是外國人在中國境內販賣毒物），是政府的力量所不能完全達到的」，這是一件十分痛心的事，我們一方面固然痛心於在我們領土之內，會有我們政府權力所不能及的地方，另一方面，我們更痛心於像禁烟運動那麽天經地義的事，到現在這個時代，竟還不能獲得國際間的一致的同情與援助。</p>
<p>前幾天，國際聯盟禁止鴉片委員會，在日內瓦開會，英美代表報吿對於日本政府不取適常有效辦法，紛致詰資，日本代表並未加以駁斥，只說「日本當局對於該問顯未洞悉一切」，「日本政府對於販毒商人，並未加以縱容」，可見英美代表的報吿，自有相當的可靠性，這非但中國方面蒙其不利，即是世界的禁烟運動，也受到極大的影響。</p>
<p>中國代表胡世澤氏於報吿中國禁烟計劃後說「一九三五年因違禁販賣吸食製造毒品而被　死刑者，共有九百七十人，……國家之生命，現繫於對毒藥之奮鬥，此爲吾人必須堅持到底者」，眞的，禁絕烟毒，已爲我們復興民族的先决條件，我們必須依照禁烟計劃，與烟毒澈底奮鬥，絕其根株，我們希望日本政府，同情於我們，對於本國人民之販賣烟毒的，予以有效的處置，則中國的禁烟運動，固然大受其賜，日本帝國在國際間的榮譽，亦不致受其玷汚，對於中日兩國的民族感情的融洽，更大有助力了。</p>

<p>— 陸京士</p>
<p>中國近百年來的歷史，可說是一個被帝國主義征服的黑暗時期，雅片戰爭就是這個時期的開端，也是中國民生困窮國勢衰弱的根本原。</p>
<p>在淸季乾嘉時代，雅片年有大量輸人，流毒日深，政府雖設有禁律，但因官吏腐敗，執行不力，反使烟毒日增。至道光時政府始决心禁絕，允以當時兩廣總督林則徐的主張最爲堅决，辦法最爲撒底。他的奏議中會有幾旬最警策的話。。「雅片之毒，甚於洪水猛獸，天下萬世之人斷無有以雅片爲不必禁者。此禍不除，十年後無可用之兵，無可籌之餉。」並追令廣東土商繳出烟土，英商初尙抗命不交，後經發兵包圍商館，始將全部毒物交出，計雅片二萬零　百八十三箱，値銀五六萬元，全部焚燬於虎門。風聲所佈，舉國稱快。</p>
<p>英商遭此打擊，乃竟藉口出兵進攻廣東，我方早有準備，未得逞。改攻浙江定海寗波，北襲天津，淸延爲之大震，一般大臣，不知人勢，不但不籌抵抗，反將林公　職，講配伊犁，然後向英國允和，簽訂了喪權辱國貽害萬世的南京條的。這個英勇的拒毒戰爭是在「六三」爆發的，雖然結果是那樣悲慘的失敗，但是這失敗是光榮的，由於我們的慘痛犧牲，使全世界認識了我們不惜以最高代價撫取生存權利的偉大民族性。</p>
<p>現在離雅片戰爭已有九十七年了。反顧團內，不惟沒有完全撲滅毒氛，反而日見毒燄的蔓延，據海關統計，自一八七六年至一九二八年這五十三年中，雅片進口，値關銀十三萬萬兩，其他爲海關耳目不及秘密偷入者，更不知多少，無謂消耗，如是之鉅，國家安得不窮。在這樣的環境中，我們來紀念這偉大悲壯的「六三」，眞有無限的痛心，同時更覺到我們責任的重大。</p>
<p>從雅片戰爭的史實看來，我們得了一個很大的敎訓，就是一個沒有决心的政府，决不能成就一件非常的事業，允其是問題複雜情形嚴重的禁毒使命。過去九十幾年來禁毒的沒有效果，也完全是這原因。現在政府知道過去的「寓禁於徵」不是辦法，於是下了最大的决心，决定二年禁毒六年禁烟的計劃，頒佈峻嚴法令，嚴厲執行。不過「徒法不足以自行」，因爲法令本身不會發生力量，完全要人民遵守奉行，單靠政府的努力，是不能完成這偉大使命的。從前林則徐禁烟的失敗，就因爲缺少忠實的同志，沒有團體行動，什麽事全仗一個人精神去幹，結果至於失敗。所以我們要求民族解放，要掙脫帝國主義鐵練的束縛，應全國民衆一致動員，共起撲滅毒物，監督政府擁護政府去推行禁毒法令，同時還得自己相互監督，勉勵，勸戒，務使毒氛肅清，中國才能獲得眞正解放。這是我們今天紀念六三」有的反省與努力。</p>
<h3 id="c178">撲滅烟毒 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 杜月笙</p>
<p>鴉片起原甚早，蓋當唐貞元時代（西曆八百餘年）阿拉伯商人已將罌粟一物輸入中國，降至有明中葉（十五世紀末）葡萄牙人壟斷東洋貿易，其貨品鴉片一物，華言亦稱之為阿芙蓉者，實係阿語Afion之譯音。然鴉片在始用時實為治痢藥劑，於我國醫書中類能見之，初不料其積久成習，一度不吸，便如大病遽發，比不食粟尤加痛苦；且傷敗精神，涸血爍體，至終身罹痼疾，而所生子女，胥成弱種。其為害等於鴆毒，自害害人，害社會，害國家，害民族，是故此患不除馴至世界人類必全遭其毒噬覆沒也無疑，可不懼哉。</p>
<p>我國遭此毒害，其始作倆者，固為葡人：然至淸乾隆叫十六年（一七八一年）英吉利東印度公司自本國政府得壟斷中國貿易之特權，而印度孟加刺地方，又爲鴉片產地，於是輸入中國較易，數量亦日增。中經乾，嘉之嚴定禁律，但法令稍弛，則販者吸者又復如故。自嘉慶二十二年，至道光十八年，二十餘年間，輸入額之增加幾至九倍。鴉片輸入旣盛，不獨於人民衛生上，道德上，生種種之弊害而已，又於社會之經濟上，有非常之影響者也。淸廷憂之，謀所以處决鴉片問題者。於是鴉片禁止之讓，已成爲政治上唯一急切之問題矣。</p>
<p>道光十九年正月二十九日，吾人今日所紀念之先賢林則徐遂至廣東，査辦鴉片，本其不屈不撓之精神，發爲除毒務盡之謀。其翌年（一八四〇年）鴉片之戰爆發，英軍迭陷沿海各要隘，而且進逼南京。淸廷乃派廣州將軍宗室耆英等至英艦磋商和議條件。一八四二年八月二十九日兩國使臣正式簽押江寗條的十三欵。</p>
<p>吾人今日於痛定思痛之餘，對此國定「禁烟節」應發爲最大之覺悟，以剷除此摧毀國基之毒物，庶不負林公則徐所詔所吾人之敎訓也</p>
<p>方今我國政府已决定整個禁烟計劃，大有滅此朝食之勢。而我蔣委員長兼禁烟總監復具最大之决心，總綰全國禁烟禁毒之事宜。國人對此，應秉承政府意旨，間接直接均應從旁協助，以求禁烟計劃之成功，而謀國家民族之復興，蓋際茲國勢阽危，吾人除自力更生而外，實無別徑可循也。鴉片之爲害。病國蠢民，夫盡人而知之矣；而其顯然最著者，厥惟社會經濟之受其侵害。何以言之？良以吸烟之人旣多，其烟費之消耗的數字，至堪驚人，而其影響於生產方面者，又不知其幾千萬億也！吾人瞻前顧後，實不禁成慨系之，是所望於有志之士曁愛國同胞，羣起以撲滅之耳。</p>

<p>— 周念先</p>
<p>法人對鄭兆佳林寶華之印象甚佳</p>
<p>（巴黎通訊）鄙人酷愛網球、念及國內同好、願以台杯比賽中法交戰經過、吿我國人、當然、比數結果諸位均已早悉這裏所述、乃較詳之紀事及各方評論、個我無私的批評、也率直地島在下面、</p>
<p>五月一日午後、陰天下、微風中、開始了中法台杯比賽、第一場單打許承基對蒲塞斯Boossus在不緊張的局面下、連送兩盤、以六比〇、六比〇造成希有的紀錄、第三盤稍留頗面以六比一結束比賽、法報說、道場比賽、未能表現蒲塞斯底技能、實在無甚可述、但鄙人　却欲提醒讀者幾點、蒲氏是世界著名選手、多年經騐、本非我國任何選手可以對敵、加之許君身體素不健壯、再受二十五日風浪抵此、塲地生疎、氣候不慣、本　情有可原、但是觀者不能曲諒、許君在其動作太慢、不肯盡力、只求招架、不謀進取、回思許君在國內之種種成功、實有令人不解之處、或測其身體違和、想即是因也、第　場鄭兆　對特斯脫勒摩、Destremau形勢完全一變上場鄭即占分得一局、對方見風頭不對、謹愼應敵、攻守並取、卒以六比一勝第一盤、經此一盤交手、鄭君　得門徑、手法亦較新頴、終以三比六失去第二盤、第三盤漸入佳境、初以二比一占先、受同胞百餘人之鼓勵、精神煥發、努力應戰、血達四此二、繼成平平、特氏復以發球占勝、而成五比六、法方形勢雖優、而精力疲乏鄭氏則球球沉着、如開球連勝三記、致成六比六均勢、復以反手重抽、連連吿捷、終以八比六勝第三盤、十分鐘休息後、第四盤　始、鄭君又以二對〇占先、對方恐怖、捨攻而守、鄭君上網技能軗遜、致未獲勝、然而空氣則異常緊張、旋又因公正有　、致鄭君連敗、而成二比三、繼以三此三至三比六、而失去第叫盤、</p>
<p>第一日之比賽遂吿結來、法報對鄭君評語甚佳、對其勇敢精神允爲欽佩、察其實力應在許君之上、並允列其名於世界第一流選手之末、</p>
<p>第二日天氣晴明、許承基偕林實華登塲對敵、與法方巴洛屈拉Borotra。貝爾那Benrand比　打、許君雖　活躍、但仍少精彩、而林實華則以　球及上綱、博得掌聲不少、上手總嫌生疎、第盤以六對一失敗、但因兩君忠勇應戰、第二盤由一比三　造成三比三之均勢、法方見形勢緊張、巴洛屈拉大顯身手、卒以一比六輸去第二盤、慣例轉機、常在第三盤、目看我方取勝、法方借勝　餘威、以二比〇占先、但繼山巴氏開球，連連不利、而成二比一、許承基此决　球異常奏功、交戰五合後、而成三比二均勢、再經幾番苦門惡戰、我方以四對三占先、此後常常雙方上網、精彩異常、我敵各得一局、而成五對四優勢、屆時輪到林實華開球、跟臂重擊、球近綫邊、對方還球艱窘、我軍連勝三球、再以林君攔網之巧妙、卒以六對四勝第三盤、　刻鐘休息後、重行登塲、許君常有錯誤、致敵方以三比　占先、再輪　君　球、許君振作應戰、連勝兩局、合成二比三之比　繼　貝爾那攔網有方，時出美着、我方又因聯絡較鬆、而以　比一吿敗、經此三塲、我國已定淘汰　但第三日　之兩單打仍繼續進行、當晚各報對林君打評、亦多贊美、惜以二人聯絡較差耳、第三日之比賽結果、本可預測、惟最引人注意者、在鄭兆佳對蒲塞斯之比賽、第四塲先由許承基　對特斯脫勒摩、許君因見敵方較遜、自己稍徵胆壯、於是攻着較多、惜仍太遲緩、故初二盤以三比六、　、比六輸去、但其對角抽球之穩健、實有工夫、不應埋沒其長處、因此佳着常施、第三盤以六比四獲　、照章休息十分鐘後、再以令副精神應戰、法方知道特氏實力較遜、恐有失敗之處、故公正關心垂愛、格外帮忙許君逖以二比六敗北殊足惋惜、但是平心而論、特氏年僅十八齡半、今年第一次參加台杯希望許君、勉力求進、以慰衆望、</p>
<p>許君賽畢後　由鄭君對浦塞斯、結果未能出衆、　其比數六比〇、六比〇、六比　實與許君伯仲、但其應戰之努力、追球之勇收、實在令人欽佩、蒲氏對鄭、已非如對許之易易、有時頗感應付困難、試觀其第　盤還球之數、即知其有　番激戰矣、鄭君對蒲氏之抽球、初多向其左手、此爲通常戰策、但遇敵方用左手時、應變更戰略、鄭君經一盤失敗之主因、即在此、後兩盤中、鄭君改抽敵方右手蒲氏對付數難、此所以有第二盤每局比較之接近也、總之、鄭君與許君　戰敗之結果雖同、但其經過則比較漂亮、法報對其英勇、則終贊美不置也、余亦祝鄭君努力、前途無量、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>發明為工業上進步之好現象，吾國人最缺乏者，為發明事物，以故張伯苓先生曾說「歐美人是創作，日本人是仿作，中國人是不作」。這是多麼慚愧的事情。可是最近吾覺得國人對於發明事物的趣味，一天濃厚一天起來，去年統計國人發明之事物，向實部呈請專利和專用權的，有三十八起之多。其中不知紋去幾多腦汁，費去幾多精神，用去幾多　量，經過幾多的艱難困苦，　得這種小小的成就，可佩的發明家，可敬可仰的發明家，這是國家的寶貝，這是中華民族的光榮，尤其是中國工業史上最榮譽的一頁。</p>
<p>吾最近所參觀的，有三個丁廠：一是中國油燈廠鍾靈君發明的壓力植物油燈，一是中華敎育玩具廠阮順法君發明的月日星期時辰鐘，一是奇特自由燈泡廠包益民君發明的自由五用電燈泡。吾參觀以後，均覺這三種器物，都是人生日用所必需。植物油燈，更能利用國產植物油，為國人自給的基礎，其效用尢為偉大。最難得的，阮順法是造船廠工人出身，包益民是電力公司的工友，已有甚深的造詣，乃能鎭研事物，努力研究，費去三四的工夫，苦心孤詣，不厭不倦，　得這樣的成就，吾是萬分　佩。並表示照着阮包　君的努力奮　，中國前途一定是很有希望的。吾想中國一年一年畢業的大學生，何止數千人，都　着沒有事　，沒有職業，沒有發展才能的機會。可是吾遍檢發明人中，很少是大學生，大學生的貢獻在那裏？反求　已，當亦啞然。而阮包　君居然以工人地位，　能創造事物，有這種的貢獻。並且發明人中，都是沒有受過高深敎育的。吾們很慚愧，吾想許多大學生都要慚愧。因此吾想政府此後對於發明人，要儘量的獎勵，儘量的提携和　助，使未來的發明人一天多似一天，中國工　　有更生的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c223">國貨獎金的管見 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 李伯黍</p>
<p>一個國家的繁榮，無論如何，是跟工商業的發達成正比例的。一國的國貨工業發　，自然，外貨也無從侵入，至少也要在國內立不住足。所以，能使國貨工業極度的發展起來，才是復興國民經濟的根本的，澈底的，積極的辦法。當然，我們在對外方面，應該切實的抵制外國貨物的侵入；而在對內方面，只有力謀國貨工業的發展。這是同一個人力謀自身體力的壯强以抵抗外界　病菌的侵入的道理一樣的切實，一樣的有效騐。</p>
<p>那末，要謀國貨工業的發展，一方面固然要我們努力的提倡，但，國府方面，也不可不有獎勵的表示，而使得國貨界能夠充分的製造得格外完美，使民衆能夠眞正的去樂用，這樣，才能予外貨以一個有力的打擊。所以，我以為國貨獎金，的確是有設置的必要。這關鍵的確可以影響　到國經濟的繁榮。</p>
<p>其次，我要說明的，所謂國貨獎金，是與專利權等，截然不同的，牠們的性質雖然同是獎勵，但辦法完全是兩樣的。照我的意見，這筆獎金，預先由實業部設法募集，每年舉行一次大規模的（全國的）國貨展覽會，當塲由國府派人去評較（當然，這項工作，是很難做的，但只要多派一些　批評的人，　至少可以避免一些主觀了），揀其中頭等的產品，詳細記錄下來，分別將是項獎金分配出產乾。這樣，非但可以使得國貨　　生　種激烈的競爭心，同是還可以使國貨界　大家得有觀麼的機會。</p>
<p>最後，我還希望國貨界來加以共同的研討。</p>
<h3 id="c224">禁烟節與提倡國藥運動 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今天六月三日，是國民政府所公定的禁烟拒毒節。全國各地，都很熱烈的舉行禁烟拒毒宣傳，這確乎是一件很有意義，很有價値的工作。站在復興民族的立塲而論，尤其覺得是急不容緩的一件事。</p>
<p>不過，就我的意見看來，拒毒禁烟的宣傳，固然是非常重要，急不容緩，在前清的時候，竭力主張嚴禁鴉片的林則徐先生，曾經說過：「中國如不嚴禁鴉片，則十年以後，匪特無可用之兵，抑且無可籌之餉。…」中國國民黨的總理，孫中山先生，也曾說過：「凡革命之政府，誓不與鴉片毒物相妥恊！」鴉片之應該嚴禁，固已彰彰明甚，用不着在這裏多說了！然而，我們一方面誠然應該贊助政府努力的實行禁烟計劃，同時，在另一方面說來，我們也應該努力的提倡國藥運動，那才對呢</p>
<p>為什麼我們在禁烟节的今天，要喊出这个提倡国藥運動的的口號呢？我們知道，目前一般的　君子，他們之與鴉片，所以結為不解綠的綠故，大都是在生病的進候，為了醫治疾病起見，才漸漸的染上了癮的。上癮之後，便一日不可不吸，於是日日沉醉於烟榻之旁，廢時失業，傾家蕩產，都是由於起初的不愼，而得到的悲慘的結局呀。</p>
<p>我們提倡國藥運動，便是要使一般的人，在身染疾病的時候，萬萬不要去和鴉片接近，更不要存吸了鴉片，毛病便自會好的念頭。須知道，鴉片烟是一种殺人不見血的毒藥，任何人和它一接近，都要被它戕害的。而且，國業藥之中，有許多藥品，遠勝於鴉片之上，服後萬萬不會上癮的呢。在全國舉行禁烟節的今天，作者特地揭出這個提倡國藥運動的口號，或許不是一件沒有意義的事吧。</p>
<h3 id="c225">關於公務員制服採用國貨原料之檢討 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 諸琹</p>
<p>中央最近訓令全國黨部，機關，團體，學校等，於總理紀念週舉行時一律均須穿着禮服，男性：黑褂藍袍或中山裝，女性：長褂或衫裙。須整潔樸素，顏色以適合時令為宜，制服原料均一律採用國貨。由於制服採用國貨原料這一點，我們不得不有檢討之必要。</p>
<p>公務員者，為民衆之楷模，處處須以身作則，為羣衆的領導者，此次中央訓令公務員的制服須採用國貨，照例，我們毌須有這「採用國貨」的四個字來示知。其實，中國人的心地已成為處處須受人的抑制而不能抓住自己主動的主見去做，於是為民衆楷模之公力員的制服，亦須加上「採用國貨」四個字的命令。</p>
<p>我們見到一般的公務員，包括黨政軍警機關的領袖，和中上級的官員而論，拿透切銳利的目光去估量到他們身上的服裝，憑自己的良心說一句，有幾個是用純粹的國貨綢布做制服的，他們非但把價可知貴昂的舶來品衣料製成畢挺的西裝和中山裝外，同時在他們身上更搜不出用國貨原料來製成的東西，他們又顧自身一切的『洋貨』而大喊着提倡『國貨』的口號，不論在集會演講，字裏行間，　不是鼓勵着民衆一致採用『國貨』的呼聲，這簡直是矛盾的極點，這無形地喪失了民衆服用國貨的信仰心。</p>
<p>誠然，『以身作則』本不是一件容易的事，空口唱高調，那是人人會幹的玩意兒，反正實事求是的做去，那非得有毅力有决心的幹去不可。</p>
<p>於是我很懇切地盼望着當局，把公務員的制服『採用國貨』問題，應切實的商酌一下，我以為有下列的二個辦法，使公務員的制服，採用純粹的國貨原料：</p>
<p>由政府指定國貨廠商出品之純粹以國產絲綢或棉織品的原料，着令各省市黨政軍警機關團體學校等一律採用該廠出品之衣料，做成制服，衣料　色須合時令，由政府認定購製，式樣須一致，以求經濟樸素，美觀整齊之目標。</p>
<p>文官均衣黑褂藍袍，已有明令，惟黑褂藍袍均須採用國產土布或綢緞為限，不得購用舶來衣料。武官制服亦然着令各省市黨政軍警機關團學校等，一致服從，並擬成公務員服用國貨之獎懲辦法，以公務員服用國貨與否，而示嘉勉與申誡，此項辦法得由最高長官督促行之，並可例入公務員考績辦法之內。</p>
<p>以上兩點，前者可使國貨有通銷公力員及全國機關之機會，並能使國貨廠商得有發燕尾服國產工業之便利，又可使舶來品减少傾銷的數量。後者能使公務員絕跡不買舶來品之功能，以塞漏巵。此不但於國貨前途銷力之擴展，並可使我國經濟財源流出國外堵　壖堤也。尚祈政府當局，國貨廠商，同文諸君，共同檢討之。</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>技巧，是藝術的一個基本質素。藝術之中，若缺乏了技巧，也就不成其為藝術了。例如一件很平凡的故事的叙述，善於藝術的，便能用很平凡的字面，叙述得使人笑，使人淌眼涙，使人興奮，或時使人同情，使任何讀者，讀着這故事，似乎是親歷其境，面目睹一切，或竟似科自己也竟成了故事中的主角之一那麼的痛癢相關。這便是叙術者的善於慶用他的叙事的技巧。反之，不善於技巧的，虽然滿纸上，鋪叙着跰四儷六的錦繡一般的文字，堆砌得声韻鏗鏘，其結果，終不過使讀者，感覺着在讀一篇故事的記叙文而已。</p>
<p>作　，也是如此。善於技巧的畫家，能用疎疎幾筆，再也簡單不過的結構，組成一個能吸住讀畫者的目光的畫面，而更引人入勝。攝影，也是如此。能在質的方面，加厚，而出量的方面减少的，才能在产品之中包含着他的藝術之中所具有着的技巧的質素。我嘗讀某翁筆記，見有一記一某測字者，有人拈「魚」字問流年，他見適有人担水而過，便說「如魚得水。」別有一人，見而亦指這「魚」字問休咎，他見對面屋上有一貓，便搖着頭說，「貓口之　」。某甲拈得一「塔」字，他說「步步高升」。別一人，亦指此「塔」字求卜，他說，「你站的地位，適與此塔字相反，故愈下愈窄一塔（塌）糊塗。」這個測字先生，可謂以技巧勝人的了。</p>
<p>再如打牌，雖是消閒工作之一，可是打牌者，也不可少着技巧。同是一副牌，善於技巧的，能打去一張，而等着三叫，甚至於四叫。不善於技巧的，等着二叫就完了，庖丁做菜，總是一個味兒的，主婦們倒能做出一二色新鮮餚饌來，顯出伊們特有的做菜的技巧。</p>
<p>有人說，技巧是由經騐進化的，我以為技巧是天才的結晶。所以有做人的天才的，才有處世的持巧，而獲得地位，否則，無論如何努力，總是吃力而不能討好。</p>
<h3 id="c229">與顧傳玠閒話崑劇 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>七八年前，在上海極受一般雅人閃所讚美的崑劇名小生　顧傳玠現在是已不再度　着紅氍毺上的生活了，我們可以在首都　金陵大學找到他，而且，奇怪得很，他不但不是讀的　戲劇系，根本不是文科，而是農科。據我們幾個比較和他接近的　朋友看來，他的確是有着　到農村去埋頭苦幹的雄心的。</p>
<p>半個月前，在老友陳存仁醫師的診所裏，又和他見面了，他却不是特地從南京　趕來看病的，實在有着　别的原因；这原因暂时　还不能發表，大致是和熊式一君在英美排演西廂　記一劇有些關係的。</p>
<p>我們隨便閑談了一會，不覺又談到了崑劇上面去。崑劇在現在的藝壇上已成為一個被遺棄者了，這究竟是什麼綠故呢？依顧傳玠的批評是：</p>
<p>沒有有　組絹的宣傳和提倡；</p>
<p>崑劇從業員　以及一般票友們思想太舊，不知進取。</p>
<p>這三點　確是崑劇的致命塲，就是我也是常感覺到崑劇實在並不難，實在很有興趣，而何以不能在戲劇界中，佔一個相當的地位呢？眞是不可思議的怪事。這日我和顧傳玠君再三研討之後，彼此都以為崑劇確有保存和提倡的必要，第一大家應該把「曲高和寡」一類的說話改變過來，要知道崑曲唱詞雖然比深一些，但演唱的人總是一路唱，一路演，聽的人並不需要完全瞭解它的唱詞，從演員的表情上便　可得其彷彿；何况崑剧中的道白都极淺明受聽，也無異於平劇。顧君以為，此後如能在：　演唱時散發說明書，　注意改善佈景和道具，　訓練新人才，幾點上努力，那末要使崑復興　必不是怎樣一件難事。</p>
<p>顧君並且以為　崑劇和平劇，在歐美人的眼光中看來，崑劇比較要歡迎一些，但看梅蘭芳君出國時表演的　幾齣戲，「刺虎」的確最博好評，便是一個明證。</p>
<p>太平洋上想求太平而　斷從此不太平</p>

<p>昔人有愛好風雅的，凡筑一室，設一店，總要東央西托，倩名公巨子為撰匾額，以為光寵。故此什麼軒，樓廬，堂，室，居，園，舍，閣，　，齊，館之類，稱謂繁多，不可勝計的名色，都給引用起來了。匾額題得好的，古今來當不在小數。現在單說幾個奇趣橫生的：</p>
<p>有代某庸醫題基堂曰「明遠堂」者，人問其故，答曰：『子未讀下論乎？其言曰：「…不行焉，可謂明也已矣……不行焉，可謂遠也矣。」這樣說來，明遠就是不行不行。』</p>
<p>又一僕人暴富，大建居室，請名人題匾，乃為題「旦白堂」三字。人詢其意，告曰：「小旦遵白，未有不自稱奴家乾。旦白之意，於些得來一。（見笑林）</p>
<p>又有為某酒肆題名曰「者者居」者，語人曰：「吾取其近者悅遠者來之意也。」可謂別有思致。</p>
<p>一人以鐵匠起家，其弟則為皮匠，富後各　居室，請名士題額，欲掩其出身之賤。一名士題其兄匾曰「二酉堂；」弟匾曰「甲乙堂」。二人大喜，懸之中堂。不知一酉直看，酷似鐵匠用之砧子；一酉橫看，有如風箱也。至於甲字則像皮匠用之鋼錐，乙字偈皮刀，皆取像形字眼，以愚弄此難史弟者也。（亦見笑林）</p>

<p>第二回　芳草麗人天徵波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫</p>
<p>說到這位姑娘，他不斷的回頭，那眞是看人嗎？可是他很明白的表示，却是另有感觸的。他歏了一口氣，對嫂嫂道：這山上的野　不少，只怕埋的不是那種人，我若死了，有託兩位嫂嫂，把我埋在這裏罷。或者對得起這一塊土。一個年紀大些的少婦笑道：夢蘭，你這些時候，總說這些喪氣的話幹什麼？夢蘭道：一點也不喪氣，一個人總有一回死的，死了能免了埋下土　嗎？這雨花　，葬了明朝一個大大的忠臣方孝孺，我們要死了，葬在大忠臣的墳邊，那也是一場莫大的榮幸。一個年輕些的少婦道：話雖如此，你眞有那樣一天，要到你七老八十的，兒孫滿堂，然後把你抬上山來。夢蘭立刻把脚步走快些，離開了他們。而且將兩隻手掩了耳朶。在後面的兩位少婦，都笑着，向後跟了來，只管叫道。慢點走呵！我們不說你就是了。下得山來，夢蘭的愁容，還不曾减退，閙得這兩位嫂嫂，也不便再說什麼。好在他是常常發愁的，兩個嫂子，也不為介意。原來這位夢蘭小姐姓江，是本城富戶的女兒，今年十八歲，就在城西振坤女子中學讀書。今天星期，也是在家裏發生了一種不可言煩　他母親江太太就對兩個兒媳說天氣很好，帶夢蘭到外面去玩玩罷。不想走到雨花臺，又碰到了章國器，這更讓他心裏苦上加苦。回到家裏以後，什麼話也不說，竟自回到他所住的那一幢小樓上去了。南京的公館屋子，向來是一進跟着一進，直可以通到七八進的。夢蘭家裏的屋子，共有六進，在倒數的第二進的屋子上，蓋了一幢小小的樓房，樓房後面，有個小的院子，搭了一方薔薇架子，裁了兩三棵樹，七八本芭焦，各方面點綴小盆景和太湖石，也就算是花園了。院子右面，是一道粉墻，紛墻外面，緊鄰着人家的菜園，有兩棵幾十年前的老柳樹，高樹到半空裏去。夢蘭坐在樓上，橫窗列了一張書桌子，他總愛對了這兩查高柳出神的。這天回家，他上得樓來，洗過一把臉，　靠了書桌坐下，想　　一本書來定一定神。就在這個時候，女僕吳媽，捧着茶壺，帶了一個紙捲進來。夢蘭看到，立刻滿臉透出了笑容，就把紙捲抽到手上。然後趕快的在油　　找出一把小刀子來，把紙　綏綏的輕輕的剔了開來，乃是一本書，有很美麗的對而，在對面上題了四個字，乃是雙星雜誌。（三〇）</p>

<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>紅豆和文人，發生關係，除了唐朝王紡摩詰，明末餞謙益牧齊，清初惠棟定宇以外，要算已故詩人劉大白了。</p>
<p>要說大白和紅豆的關係，先說他的生平，在朱自清編選中國新文學大系詩集的詩話中，有一段的記載：</p>
<p>劉大白，名靖裔，以字行，浙江紹興人，已故，有舊夢，（後重編為了寗再造秋之滬賣布謠）郵吻，舊夢付印自記說：「他的新傳統氣味太重，而且這氣味循環的複現着，不容易消滅」。又說：「他用筆太重，愛說盡，少含蓄。</p>
<p>同時中學標準敎本初中國文上，作者小傳，也有一段的記載：</p>
<p>劉大白，（現代）浙江紹興人，歷任上海復旦大學中國文學系主任，兼實騐中學主任，浙江省敎育廰秘書，國立浙江大學秘書長，國民政府敎育部常任次長，敎育部政務次長，著有舊夢，郵吻，了寗，</p>
<p>（以上詩集）舊詩新話，白屋文話等書。</p>
<p>我很嚕囌的寫了出來，再有夏丐尊君，寄我中國名人小史，（？）可惜被我遺失了，否則更可以介紹得詳細引起大白和紅豆發生興趣，因為江陰周剛直，送了他一雙紅豆，（是一九二四年的元旦）隔不多時，就寫成一篇雙紅豆的散文，（刋在舊詩新話中）在那篇文中，有三首雙紅豆詞，寫得　綿悱惻，甚是可愛，不過為了雙紅豆以後，就發生情的問題了，他把紅豆曾交給吳芙霞，換句話說，把愛情也交給吳芙霞，可是芙霞對於大白，並不怎樣熱戀，其主要原因，因為大白家窮，又不會多括錢，所以芙霞說：「我所需要的，你不能使我滿足。」這句話，除了經濟方面，當然在精神方面了，不過大白的熱情，是十分增高，在「謳歌」中，可以窺見一斑，謳歌是新體詩，有四段，首句都是「霞是最値得謳歌的」。後來在杭州，兩人有了裂痕，可於「別」中約略見到，像「病裏春歸人別久，不為相思，也為相思瘦」。信到何曾，信到何曾是。」「是夢何妨，是夢何妨試」。可以知道大白那時的痛苦了。後來芙霞住在蕭山，睡在別個男人的懷中，不念大的了，大折和芙霞分離時，大白異常痛苦，他說：「撕碎了舊夢，决心地撕碎了舊夢，似乎常在心頭」！</p>
<p>後來大白死了，有某女士曾親至杭州撫棺慟哭，大白家人戚友，都不知道伊人是誰，伊自承與大白有　愛的關係，曾經同居過的，且出雙紅豆以為憑信，這樣看來，那某女士是否是吳芙霞，還是一個啞謎，若然眞是吳芙霞，終算有些良心，不忘過去的情人，憑棺一哭，可惜死者已矣，那裏知道他的最値得謳歌的霞，還來痛哭呢？以後這一雙紅豆，又不知流落在誰人手中呢？</p>
<p>大白是多情人，也是窮書生，可惜一雙紅豆，寄託在嫌窮的女人手中，大白為了紅豆，寫文題詩，同時贈給他的愛人，不過他的一生，未免太痛苦了。</p>
<p>拙輯紅豆集中，把大白的雙紅豆，刋在紅豆遺著中，同時附錄了他的高足曹聚仁君的相思子，和晨報都會風光中轉錄海嘯君的紅豆，使得羽翼已故的詩人，有些知道生平，想不到十年以後，有痴人替他表揚刋佈咧！</p>

<h3 id="c244">敎員枵腹難堪自殺 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 劍平</p>
<p>敎育界是一條「淸苦」的路，這是每一個人都應當承認的了。「淸苦」是還可以活下去，最多不過不會發洋財，反正不會就這樣餓死。因此，很多人便以為走敎育界是「淸高」了。——這樣記着「高」，便忘掉了「苦」的夢一般的人們，到現在還是不少。可惜事情沒有這麼簡單，這世界跟人鬧蹩扭的事正多着。便是敎育界這個例子吧，現在便淪至「困苦」，「淸」固然談不到，要「活下去」似乎也不容易了。時發時止的各地敎員的索薪運動，便是一個很好的鐵證。也許，還有人以為索薪運動不過是「偶然的」現像，不大相信敎育界的破產眞的便是如此。那麼，請看最近在徐州的一幕敎員斷炊，枵腹難堪，而至自殺的慘劇吧！</p>
<p>銅山五月二十八日電：徐敎費破產，各校欠薪竟遠八月，敎員斷炊。左窪小學校敎員枵腹難堪，突自殺，引起全體敎界索薪運動。</p>
<p>敎員的「突自殺」，是為了「斷炊」，為了「枵腹難堪」。而這兩原因又决定於因「敎費破產」，而至「欠薪達八月」。由此，我們可以明白這决不會是一件「偶然的」事情。同時很可以肯定地說：左窪小學的敎員可以因「枵腹難堪」而「突自殺」，而其他學校又何嘗不可以；便算不自殺，而因「枵腹難堪」至餓死，相信也不希奇吧。由此我們也可以明白敎界破產至那一地步，實在已超過「淸苦」，——甚而至「困苦」這一種類的用語了。</p>
<p>但是，如果換了一方面來講，把我們的眼睛更擴展一下，又會對於這樣一幕慘劇認為很平凡的，在意料中的事了。接二連三的天災人禍，再加上帝國主義的侵略，我國經濟已整個破產，因災荒而至難民遍地，觀音士，樹皮，已代替了一切食糧，餓死已是平常事，枵腹難堪自殺當然不希奇。不過，所謂不希奇却並不是說「活該」或不理。反之，正因為不希奇，正因為已是平常事，我們更該認為是一件嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>敎員枵腹難堪自殺，是由於敎費破產，而這又是為了國家整個經濟破產但是，這整個經濟破產却又是為了帝國主義不斷地多方面的侵略和剝削，同也是整個經濟機構的不健全。因此，我們從這一幕慘劇，不但應認淸敎界的產的現狀，同時更應該不忘記這半殖民地國家的規狀。至於彌補這缺陷的方法，當然是只有針對這問題的結癥，那才是一個最正確的對策。</p>
<h3 id="c245">旅途中 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 費向東</p>
<p>那一年的暑假中，我從家裏起程，到了星加坡，再轉船到上海來赴入學考試。我搭的是康脫羅梭郵船，這是以七到的速度航行，跨過印度洋而抵上海的。在這整整一禮拜的航行中，我為了要避免孤獨起見，所以帶了曼陀鈴。想着海上的月夜，在甲板上浴着種白色的光，靜靜地撥動音綫，海濤打着拍子，這種情境是多麼可懷戀的哪。</p>
<p>上船以後，把行李搬進了預定的二等經濟房間裏，我遇見了一個老人，年紀至少也有五十歲了，班白的頭髪，和眉稍的縐紋很明顯地收進我的眼臉。他已經把鋪位弄好了，向我點着頭，露出一絲慈和的微笑，過了一會，他又走近來問我上那里去；因為這康脫羅梭是要先到香港，再往上海的。我一面把日常要用的東西取出來，一面和他攀談着；自然我從什麼地方出發，和到上海去考大學的事完全讓他知道了。</p>
<p>「那是最好不過的了」，於是他說了。「年靑人要多多的唸書才對，我的大兒子是很愛唸書的，他是可憐他十五歲那一年就給我送到裁縫店去學師去了。這當然是因為我沒有錢供給他的原故。後來他說一生都抱怨我沒有多給他求智識的機會，所以才會做一個成衣匠。你可幸福哪，年靑人，到了上海要好好地用功才是啊。」</p>
<p>他說的完全是一個長者的話。我唯唯聽著，沒有回答他什麼。他發現了我那曼陀鈴，伸手去拿起來看了一會，又好奇地彈了一彈，對我說：</p>
<p>「這是什麼啊？呌曼陀鈴吧？你一定很愛音樂的了。」</p>
<p>「是的。我點點頭。</p>
<p>船開了以後，我們天天在一起，說的話也更多。他愛聽我的曼陀鈴：我們一同在船頭的甲板上坐下來，月亮是渾圓的，海上又風平浪靜，眞是難得的良夜！於是我開始彈着：彈着，曼陀鈴的聲音低低地，帶着感傷味地飄在甲板的四週。我留神著那老入，他半閉起眼睛，完全忘却了一切的樣子，讓曼陀鈴之曲陶醉了他。當我的曲子停止下來，空氣立刻又歸於沉寂之後，他就像從夢里猛地醒過來那麼地，睜大眼睛望着我的臉，好一趟不說話。</p>
<p>但是，他移動了一下身子，「你彈得眞好」！這麼說了，仰起腦袋，好像要從月亮那里找到什麼似地，使我感到這老人有點奇怪。不過在又一天的夜里，已經九點多鐘了，仍然是在那甲板上，這老人告訴我一段年靑時的故事。</p>
<p>「你的曼陀鈴帶來了太多的記憶；我是老了，一點也不中用了，但是我一想起茜美娜，我就有了安慰。她是新加坡埠上所常見的混種女兒；三十年前我們相愛着。她是彈得一手好曼陀鈴的；天天我們坐在一起，唱着歌。後來她的父親强迫她嫁給了一個英國人；自此我就沒有見過她；也完全得不到她的消息。」</p>
<p>這樣我明白過來了。我的曼陀鈴所以引起這老人的傷感，原來是曾經有過一段戀愛故事的，…</p>
<p>船到香港他就上岸去。他是台山人，要轉坐火車到廣州去。我們親熱地在九龍碼頭握着手，霏霏的細雨在我們的頭上落着；增加了一種說不出的離情。</p>
<p>「讀書是最幸福不過的事，你去吧！」他這麼地對我說，可是聲音却有點顫抖了。「我的大兒子就埋怨我沒有給他求學的機會…到了上海就用功，刻苦，不要辜負大好靑春…好了，我們再見了！」</p>
<p>如今四年過去了，這一段旅途的經過我可沒有忘記。至於那老人，我一點消息也沒有知道—祝福他的康健！</p>

<h3 id="c246">立達養鷄場參觀記 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>（本報特寫）立達學園，是有着相當歷史的，它不但對於社會學術有許多貢獻，並且，關於農牧事業，它也頗多闡發。</p>
<p>關於農牧方面，它除了江灣有一個養鷄塲之外，南翔還有一個園藝塲及農村服務部，松江及嘉興也各有一個養蜂塲，而且它與各地農學也有相當聯絡和關係。</p>
<p>昨天，我為了想明瞭一點該塲養鷄事業的情形，所以和秉忠特地云參觀了一下；當時蒙該塲管理員郭君的竭誠招待，並為詳細說明一切，因此，所得的印象頗為不少。</p>
<p>該塲共佔地二十五畝，塲中除了有十多個木板建築的鷄房之外，還遍植着許多桃杏等菓樹，和紫雲英，蔬菜之類。桃杏樹已經可以收獲，紫雲英是供蜜蜂採花用的（因塲中也養有蜜蜂），而蔬菜却全是　鷄的飼料。此外，還種着各種花卉雜樹等；所以這里不但是個養鷄塲，而且簡直還是一個很好的園藝塲呢。</p>
<p>鷄，這里現有六種，計：「萊克亨」，「魯島紅」，意大利種。「排紋洛克」，美國種。「虎鷄」，土耳其種。「雜交」，係萊克亨牡鷄和我國蕭山牝鷄的交種，「蕭山鷄」，是未經雜配的純粹蕭山鷄。全部鷄種約三百多頭。每頭壯鷄可以配十來頭牝鷄，但因為每頭牡鷄的體格各有不同，故不令亂交，必須分組隔離飼養。每組有鷄房一間，其構造恰如一間小屋，屋底為防潮起見，約高出地面二三尺，下舖以亂稻草，每日一翻，七天一更換，靠壁有鷄床，是給棲宿的，下有糞屜，每天淸除一次，傍邊還有分格的鷄櫥，是預備給牠門產蛋的窩，每房有水盆食槽各一隻。</p>
<p>我們參觀過了成年鷄房，又到育雛房里去；那里的建築是和成年鷄房不同的，它比較高大，—大約有三開間房屋那麼樣子。里面育雛分為五組，計剛脫壳及一星期，二星期，三星期，和八星期。三星期部份里生有火爐，一二星期里的也有保姆溫度表；其溫度約在九十至一百之間，壁上有統計表格，每日檢查後均須按格塡明，日夜有人管理，但其食槽和飲水器都係特製的。</p>
<p>雛鷄時常需要惚落，故每間房里置有洗浴的砂坭盆一隻。</p>
<p>據說中國鷄種要算浙江蕭山的最優良，體格也强壯，可惜產蛋不多，而且蛋壳是黃色的。意大利鷄的體格雖不及中國鷄康健。且常易患病，但是平均每頭牝鷄每年可產蛋三百枚左右；終年不休息，食慾也不旺，而蛋壳却是純白色的—本來蛋壳之黃白與實質並無關係，只是賣出時每易被人疑為普通鷄蛋，惟如果以萊克亨牝鷄和蕭山牡鷄雜交之種，才能成為意種之形式而中國種之體格，兩美兼備。然而雜交種之第一代鷄，其毛色及蛋壳均略有微黃；須至第三代，牠的毛色蛋壳方能完全變成萊克亨一般，而體格當然是和中國鷄一樣了。</p>
<p>此種鷄身，牝的大約五六斤，牡的七八斤，每頭牝鷄產蛋最多六年，而牡鷄之配合亦不過六年。</p>
<p>土耳其種却不養產蛋，而是專供食肉的；其味聽說非常肥美。牝鷄個子甚小，但牡鷄却每隻竟有二三十磅重。其形狀十分可怕。據郭君告訴我們，牠能在晚間守夜，凡遇生人，孵必狂呌。</p>
<p>後來，郭君又領我們到他的辦公處去，—那是平排地四間屋子，正中的一間是會客室，左邊一間辦事室及一間孵化室，右邊一間是飼料室。會客室里排着許多各國的鷄種標本及規章，孵化室里有熱水孵化機三隻及桌上孵化機一隻。熱水孵化機，每次同時可孵蛋二百五十枚，桌上孵化機每次亦可孵蛋五十枚；這是完全用科學方法的。每次由開始下孵至出鷄，需要三星期時間，而一年中最適宜之孵化時期為春秋才季，其他因氣候太寒太熱，故不適宜。</p>
<p>飼料方面，平常是大麥，麥麩，玉蜀黍粉等為主要食料，此外還有牛奶粉，牛骨粉，魚粉，肉粉，蠔壳粉，蠶蛹等，至於雛鷄，却另用雛鷄粉餌及孵鷄粉餌，然而蔬菜靑草亦為日常必需之食料。</p>
<p>最後郭君又說，他們這里在一二八以前原有鷄種二千多隻，該塲後來為戰事所毀，於是這二千多隻鷄種也一同犧牲于炮火之下了。雖然戰後這里立刻恢復；但在一年以前，因塲中管理的人不得其法，所以至今還沒恢複舊觀。郭君是去年調到這里來的，他現在正在計劃，將來想把這鷄種去分送給鄉下入試飼，以觀成績，如果飼養方面不發生妨碍的話，他們便準備普遍改良與提倡。</p>
<p>現在該塲除郭君外，還有五六個工人在專門管理飼鷄工作。</p>

<p>我再見老馮是在一個禮拜以後的晚上，一個公開講演會的會塲里。</p>
<p>他緊緊地握着手，像抓住一個親人似地搖着。然後，我們坐在一個角落里了。因為離開了會還有三十分鐘的樣子，我們就講起話來。當然，我詢問他　一個禮拜的生活情况，</p>
<p>「什麽也没做」，他摇摇頭，有些感嘆地說：「我不願做什麼了！……」</p>
<p>看着那巴比塞樣的側面，我很驚疑，為什麼創他會這地傷感起來了呢。平常那樣快樂，高興地寫作，講談的人物，　天却會談出這樣的話，我不能不問他了：「怎麼回事呢？」</p>
<p>一還不是不想做了，你知道我底熱情換回來的是什麼？」</p>
<p>我底眼前馬上現出彬各其他的朋友們底帶着諷刺意味的笑臉來。那一張張的笑臉像弓絃一樣，有力地往外射着尖銳的箭，又一支地中在老馮底柔弱的心上了，坐在我一旁的馮，那痛苦的臉，在暗淡的燈光下，免强的支持着這痛苦，用低低的鼻音笑了。</p>
<p>放在我臉前的眞是一心無上的難題，我怎樣來安慰他痛苦的心呢？</p>
<p>「不要這樣，你可以好好地寫下去，　者是不辜負你底心的。他們一定很了解一個作者。你好好寫，就是沒地方發表，我們大家讀一讀也是好的。事實上，你底生活還不需要稿費來維持。……</p>
<p>洞天福地講會開始了，我只好把話停止住。他也沉默了。</p>
<p>在散會的時候，我們分開手，我勸他不要灰心，他很感動地和我握握手走了。我也回到家里去。</p>
<p>一直到三個禮拜以後，我才碰見他。他却變得更不好了。變成一具只會說空話的人了，比方，見了我，問道：「你學會新文字了沒有？」接着自新文字的優點等等說了一大套。然而，他是沒有學新文字的人。有時，問我寫文章沒有，又鼓勵我，然而，他底作品不但不會完成，而且，筆都不動了。他在人們底冷淡里變了。雖鮁他那用，低低的鼻音的笑法，洞天福地保存着。</p>

<p>販私鹽的爸爸被鹽巡打死的時候，媽媽在一個冬夜裏，爬進馬家樹林裏曾上過吊，自給那看林人救回家來，重新又支持以後的苦難日子，那無盡的折磨，便把這個生長在田野中的健壯歸人壓得萎靡了。</p>
<p>在那一年十八歲的哥哥抱着一個涉茫的復仇的心願當了兵，此後，他像一顆流星似的，永遠沒了消息。媽媽憑着一隻健壯的身子，替人家整日整夜的擰着辘轤，澆着菜畦裏的蘿卜或南瓜，當麦熟或秋收的季節，天光微微露出了點灰色，鷄還沒有啼的辰光，她便提着柳條籃子，悄悄的走出村荘　，到小河邊，找那白天牲口拉車過河的水道口，她一點也沒怕那陰冷的，靜了一夜的河水，輕輕的，一步步的過河的對岸，在田野裏巡逡着，試探那看青漢子是不是已沉睡在榖草窩舖裏，假如瞅見那專欺汚她們這些窮老婆子的傢伙們，正睡眼朦朧的提着大驪棒在地邊沿上，像狗熊般看守着。她就爬到河堤下的石洞裏，从那破了的水閘口偷看着，直待看青人兜完了那個圈子，重新灒窩舖裏，鼾聲獷的傳來。她再鼠般的弓着身幹，輕快的，沿着地頭飛速的工作起來。</p>
<p>在夏天，就用雪快的小鏈刀，沙沙的割　一些閃着金光的麦穗，到秋天，她高興的選擇着，偷那放着經紅光的高梁；狗尾巴樣的黃色大榖穗，和雪團般的棉花……有時為了　多忘形一點，響動惹得看青的漢子察覺了。他便撿着那怕人的粗棍子趕來。這當口，能逃跑的時候，便拼着性命的爬上堤，偈一方大石塊样的倒身滾下去。待拖着一身泥浆躱到河南岸时，事情便算平静了。</p>
<p>生活像一條无盡的水似的流着，她越来越老了，在收穫的季節，雖然仍是要偷偷割下一些地主們的荘稼，放進自的，就是常給看青人捉住，這再沒有第，挨打或求他可憐，那些狗　般兇的漢子，很了當的把籃子奪了去，憤憤的，向那瘦得跟一捆柴似的老婦人身上，抽打幾　條，罵着　串絕子斷孫，或窮碎了骨頭的髒話，就吹着口哨走了。</p>
<p>夜晚，她拐着被打得紅腫的腿，一步一不歪的拖回家來，睡到坑上，一聲接連一聲的嘆氣，咒罵着兒子跟命運，直等枯乾的老眼上淌下涙來，無言的歇一陣，重坐起身，點上黑磁的小石油燈，火熖一閃閃跳動着，她又不停的棆着右手，紡車的木拐子隨着那鷄爪般的手指打着圈，在左手邊，她拿着一條白棉花，向綫綞子上一送一送的放着綫，紡車嗡嗡的帶着風聲，輕微的，在小屋中單調的響着，等院中的鷄幽长的啼了，較遠處的村路上，咯得的傳來趕往集上去的車聲，她鬰悶的嘆着氣，把手邊最後的一個棉條續完，她手放下來，打着哈欠，用一雙瘦骨稜稜手背，揉着那掛了大塊白眼屎的眼角，倒下身，扯過那破藍布被頭，狗　樣的睡了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After Xiao Zhang Interviewed Tadashi, Zhang Zizhong Returned to Peiping to Report. The Rail Bombing Case Is Still Under Investigation. The Tianjin Authorities Are Searching for the Criminals. The Japanese Military Will Announce the Facts. Two Road Police Officers Arrested and Released. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Diplomatic affairs representatives Zhang Zizhong and Xiao Zhenying met with Tadashi Nagayo and Matsumuro in Tianjin, resulting in promising prospects. Zhang Zizhong returned to Peiping at 9 a.m. on the 2nd to report to Song. Xiao is scheduled to go to Peiping on the 3rd as well. Regarding the bombing of the Beining Railway, the Japanese military is still under investigation. On the 2nd, Captain Sugawa of the Tianjin Military Police invited Bai Lunbi, the head of the county public security section, for further discussions and inquiries. It is rumored that the Japanese military has obtained the truth and will announce the facts within days. Currently, the Tianjin authorities and the railway are making every effort to search for the criminals. The time of the incident has been determined to be 8:20 a.m. Because the damage was very slight, the special train carrying the Japanese military departed from Tianjin to Zhangguizhuang at 10:10 a.m. without being obstructed. The authorities feel that this matter can still be considered either major or minor. Chen Juesheng is scheduled to return to Tianjin on the night of the 2nd to assist Xiao in visiting the Japanese side again on the morning of the 3rd for further negotiations. Two road police officers from the East Station were arrested by the Japanese military police on the night of the 29th and have not yet been released. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Zizhong and Xiao Zhenying went to Tianjin together. After the matter was completed, Zhang returned to Peiping this morning to meet Song and report on the situation in Tianjin. Xiao is scheduled to return to Peiping tomorrow to discuss current affairs issues. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhang Zizhong accompanied Xiao Zhenying to Tianjin a few days ago. He returned to Peiping at 9:30 a.m. on the 2nd. After getting off the train, he immediately went to Wuyiku to meet Song Zheyuan and report on the situation in Tianjin. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Bankers Association held a banquet on the evening of the 2nd to celebrate with Xiao Zhenying. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Changfu, the director-general of the Beining Railway Bureau, was summoned to the municipal government twice on the 2nd by Xiao to inquire about the bombing of the railway tracks on the night of the 29th as a basis for negotiation. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Gao Zongwu met with Song Zheyuan this morning for discussions. Qin Dechun hosted a banquet at the municipal government tonight. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The peacetime military police team has been expanded into a detachment. The new detachment leader, Colonel Ichiomiya Shinichi, arrived in Tianjin on the 2nd and paid a visit to Commander Fujii before taking office. In addition, the Tianjin Headquarters has added two new military police majors, Yomo Ryoji and Utsugi Takeo, to handle investigation affairs. Lieutenant Colonel Fukuda Minezo, the commander of the armored battalion of the Japanese New Army in North China, Lieutenant Iwasaki Tsunezo, the adjutant, and Captain Noguchi Kinichi, the commander of the cavalry special service team, took office on the 2nd. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Well-informed sources here gradually believe that the crisis in North China can still be averted. This depends on the private negotiations currently underway in Tokyo, which seem to be able to resolve the existing difficulties. The actions of Chen Zhongfu of the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee are highly secretive. A certain Chinese news agency claimed that he has "already gone east." Chen is proficient in Japanese and has many Japanese friends, so he went to Tokyo in an attempt to adjust special Sino-Japanese matters in North China. In general, given that the Japanese authorities here now hope that the two countries will restore friendly relations and cooperation, the Chinese in well-informed circles all feel that Chen's trip should be successful. Chen's departure was self-initiated. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chen Juesheng Takes Office at the Foreign Affairs Committee <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>—Publishes Written Statement— Foreign Rumors Are Not Worth Believing, Smuggling Matters Must Take Into Account the Environment</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chen Juesheng, the newly appointed Central Committee member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, took office at the committee on the morning of the 2nd. He convened a routine meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee at 10 a.m. In addition to discussing committee affairs, he also consulted on various matters. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chen Juesheng talked tonight, saying that all rumors are mostly untrustworthy. He observed that at this juncture, there may be no shortage of people secretly instigating things, but unless special circumstances arise, there will absolutely be no problems in North China. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng's written statement: Foreign rumors are not credible. Japan has repeatedly expressed to us that it will not invade North China's territory and only hopes to jointly fight communism and maintain East Asian peace. The Foreign Affairs Committee's affairs are to assist under Song's orders. The truth about the bombing of the train at the foreign flag area of the Tianjin East Station is not clear and an investigation has been ordered. However, the negligence of the railway staff cannot be evaded. Smuggling matters must take into account the relationships of all parties. The tariff system must be maintained, but the current environment must also be considered. A thorough method will be negotiated before seeking effective prevention. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ansier visited Xu Liya, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, and Sipu, the anti-smuggling tax commissioner, again on the 2nd to discuss the establishment of an anti-smuggling inspection office. The key depends on the Beining Railway. After Chen Juesheng returns to Tianjin, a decision will be made through contact. On the morning of the 1st, two more foreign anti-smuggling officers from the Shanghai General Taxation Department arrived in Tianjin to report for duty and will be assigned to work in the inspection office. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chen Juesheng, the acting chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, received guests this morning and strongly refuted recent rumors in North China. It is claimed that Japan has repeatedly stated to the central authorities of China that Japan has no intention of invading China and is willing to treat China with the spirit of equality and mutual assistance. Japan's hope lies in Sino-Japanese joint anti-communism. He personally believes that if no special circumstances occur in North China, there will absolutely be no danger. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Chen Juesheng took office at the Foreign Affairs Committee today. According to him, he was ordered to temporarily serve as the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Regarding all diplomatic matters, he will continue to handle them based on the original policy set by Chen Zhongfu. His role is temporary, and nothing will be changed. Foreign rumors are not credible. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Current Situation in North China Amidst Turmoil <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Since the successive arrival of Japanese military expansion troops in North China, the people of Tianjin and Peiping, who have long suffered from the instability of the situation, have become increasingly anxious. Those with sensitive nerves are almost constantly worried about the sudden occurrence of extraordinary events. This is because the current situation in North China is like a tangled mess, with the governing power as fragile as rotten rope, unable to withstand the shock of turbulent waves with the remaining lives of infants. On the one hand, they endure humiliation, bear burdens, and force smiles, while on the other hand, they prepare for war, draw bows, and think about moving their troops. The shame of being treated like pottery is not to be discussed, and the fear of perishing together cannot be restrained. When the bombing of the Beining Railway occurred on the 29th, the heavily overcast capital was shrouded in an even more terrifying atmosphere, creating a sense of imminent doom.</p>
<p>There are many contradictory and heavily veiled stories circulating about the bombing of the railway, making it difficult to discern the truth. Before the truth is clearly investigated, we are unwilling to lightly judge the issue of responsibility for this matter. However, at a time when people's minds are restless, even a slight misstep can easily lead to unexpected consequences. The current incident is one such example. Therefore, while the Japanese side uses troop increases as a pretext to protect expatriates, we only feel that it is increasing the complexity of the situation. Leaving aside the infringement of sovereignty, even according to what Ishii declared, "The current priority in North China is to stabilize people's minds and enable farmers and merchants to live and work in peace." However, in fact, who is responsible for creating the current serious situation and extreme anxiety?</p>
<p>Foreign newspapers often use the North China crisis as the headline for their reports on the railway bombing, or they recall the Mukden Incident and believe that the Japanese are about to take major action again. The London Liberal Party News Chronicle commented that "The bombing of the Beining Railway is just like the bombing of the railway near Shenyang in 1931. As a result of the previous bombing, most of Manchuria was occupied by the Japanese army. This deliberate bombing happened to occur on the day the Japanese troop increase plan in North China was completed. Such a coincidence is telling." The words before and after this convey subtle and incomplete arguments, and what they imply needs to be said. In fact, the railway bombing was a local incident, and the loss was minimal and should not be considered important. However, the tone of foreign newspapers is like that, and the local people are so panicked. Why do they come to such a conclusion and what tacit assumptions are they making? Is it not because they are apprehensive about past experiences and shocked by current steps, and thus unconsciously overthinking things?</p>
<p>Now the authorities in Peiping and Tianjin have clearly expressed their attitude towards dealing with the current situation: internal unity and external peace. Such a subtle stance should be enough to dispel the other party's animosity. However, the Japanese military spokesperson's statement on the railway bombing still stated, "If, after continued investigation, it is discovered that the dignity of the Japanese army has been affected, the Japanese side will resort to forceful means." The words of drawing swords and lighting lamps are truly aggressive. We want to know how the railway bombing is reflected in the overall situation in North China and can only wait and see how the situation unfolds in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Ministry of Finance Revises the Smuggling Reward Measures <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Half of the Proceeds Are Given to Informants</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has revised the measures for rewarding those who seize smuggled goods. The previous regulations stipulated giving 40% to informants. Now, in order to encourage reporting, the Ministry has decided to increase it by 10%. It has also stipulated preferential reward percentages for military and police who seize smuggled goods and those who help with enforcement or business partners who report. The measures are as follows: If customs seizes smuggled goods based on an informant's report, the informant will be given a reward of 50% of the proceeds after the customs handles the case. If various agencies and military and police (including road police) seize smuggled goods and transfer them to customs for processing, they will be given a reward of 50% of the proceeds after the customs handles the case. If business partners or factory partners report their own company's or factory's smuggling and selling activities, and customs seizes smuggled goods as a result, the informant will be given a reward of 50% of the proceeds after the customs handles the case. If customs investigates and seizes smuggled goods and invites military and police (including road police) to the scene to assist in the enforcement, the assisting military and police will be given a reward of 10%.

<p>(Vienna) Austrian dictator Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg departed today for Venice on vacation. It is said that the real purpose of Schuschnigg's trip is to discuss with Prime Minister Mussolini the way to achieve peace between Austria and Germany. If Paris and Moscow continue to demand sanctions against Italy, this understanding may form an anti-French or anti-Russian front. According to those familiar with current affairs, Mussolini may help Schuschnigg not change his original intention due to protecting Starhemberg, because winning Schuschnigg over can increase the possibility of Austro-German cooperation. (National News Agency telegram on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg has already set off for the port of Venice in Italy to meet with Italian Foreign Minister Suvich.

<p>(Rome) Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg was originally scheduled to fly here today. The government sent a plane to Vienna to pick him up, but due to bad weather in the Alps, he changed his plans and took a train to Venice at 10:00 PM tonight, where he will meet with Foreign Minister Suvich. According to Austrian official circles, Chancellor Schuschnigg is expected to stay in Italy for eight days and plans to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. Political figures in Vienna also believe that the recent removal of former Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg has affected the domestic political situation in Austria. Furthermore, the Little Entente countries may raise further protests against Austria's restoration of conscription. Schuschnigg's trip is likely related to these issues. (1st, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Italian Army's Brutal Acts Extinguish Humanity: Excerpts from an Interview with a Journalist</p>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia, on board the British mail ship "Oxford," received a reporter from the News Chronicle and made the following remarks: "Britain has always supported the League of Nations, and I trust it greatly, just as I trust France and all member states that advocate fairness. The goal of this trip is to report to the people of Europe the situation of the Italian-Abyssinian war and to ask them: My country has a history of 2,500 years; is it just to allow barbaric cultures that predate Christianity to destroy it within 25 weeks?" He also said, "The Italian army has used poisonous gas to harm Abyssinian women and children, which has been dispensed not only through artillery shells and bombs but also through special devices. I will also reveal this. As for the rumors that the British government has imposed conditions of residence to avoid engaging in anti-Italian propaganda, this is simply absurd. Even the worst culprit can defend himself. Moreover, my country is a victim of aggression, and this aggressor has been condemned by 51 countries. Why should the victim not have the right to recount his suffering?" Finally, regarding the future prospects of the Italian-Abyssinian issue, the Emperor said, "The League of Nations will surely find a solution; we must trust it. The principle of might makes right is unacceptable to all small countries, not just Abyssinia." (2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Consistently Supports the League of Nations Covenant; Firmly Opposes Austrian Restoration</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The Yugoslav Radical Union recently held a national congress here, attended by Prime Minister Stojadinović, who delivered a speech on the international situation. The main points were that the League of Nations must continue to exist, but Yugoslavia must not rely solely on the League of Nations. Yugoslavia has the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente with Romania, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, and Greece, and these alliances are the pillars upon which Yugoslavia relies. As for the restoration of the Habsburgs in Austria, it would trigger war and is firmly opposed by Yugoslavia. The Prime Minister solemnly declared that "Yugoslavia's foreign policy is based on the existing peace treaties and must not exceed the scope of the League of Nations Covenant." He also said that although the League of Nations intervened in the Italian-Abyssinian war, Abyssinia was still defeated. "However, in the eyes of Europeans, the Italian-Abyssinian war is a colonial war, so the pain and suffering are not as relevant. If the two warring countries were both European countries, their observations would not be the same." He further said, "We deeply know the horrors of war, which is why our country's foreign policy is based on peace. We have no demands of other countries, but our territory, which we inherited from various peace treaties, must be considered sacrosanct, and we will not give up even an inch of it. Some countries are advocating the revision of the peace treaties and the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, and they are sparing no effort in their propaganda. Our firm opposition is not because we are afraid of this propaganda movement, nor are we afraid of the Young Otto (heir to the Austrian dynasty) returning to Vienna, but because we deeply know that this kind of event can directly cause war, so we want to avoid it. The revision of borders will not be implemented unless there is war, which would inflict bloodshed on mankind. This is true in the colonies of Africa, and even more so in Europe. To protect our country's security, we must rely on the League of Nations for assistance on the one hand and rely on all our allies, large and small, on the other hand, and we must also rely on our own strength."

<p>(Paris) The new Parliament, dominated by the Radical Party, held its first meeting today. Hundreds of police officers were on guard around the Chamber of Deputies. No members of the Sarraut cabinet attended. The meeting began with a speech by the oldest member, Charles, who solemnly declared France's desire for peace. Then, eleven committee members were elected to study the legality of the parliamentary re-election tomorrow, and then elect a new speaker. Prime Minister Sarraut will submit his resignation on Thursday. President Lebrun will then order Socialist leader Blum to form a new cabinet. Blum plans to announce his political views on the 9th or 11th and then request a vote of confidence from the Chamber of Deputies. The most noteworthy thing at today's meeting was that the 72 Communist members of parliament entered the chamber as a group. (National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The first meeting of the 16th French Chamber of Deputies was held this afternoon. The situation was very calm. At present, the topics of discussion among the members in the Chamber of Deputies lounge are concentrated on two points: one is the formal nomination of former Prime Minister Herriot as a candidate for Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, and the other is the declaration made by Herriot, advocating strengthening the friendship between the United States and France and ensuring the resolution of the war debt issue. The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet tomorrow to review the legality of the election of the members of parliament. There are currently more than 40 members of parliament who are suspected of being illegally elected, and some have demanded that their seats be revoked. Under the insistence of the Communist Party, the three most important members whose seats they want to revoke are: the former Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Puisson (originally a Socialist member who has now left the party); the right-wing member, Chiappe, who served as the police chief when the riots broke out in Paris on February 6th and is currently the chairman of the Paris City Council; and Doriot, who was originally a Communist member but broke away from the Communist Party a few years ago due to his opposition to the Third International's interference in French internal affairs and formed his own independent Communist Party. Furthermore, the Communist Party also intends to obtain one of the six Deputy Speaker positions in the Chamber of Deputies and has decided to nominate the Communist member, Duclos, as a candidate. Once the election takes place, if the parties belonging to the left-wing Popular Front unanimously vote in favor, Duclos will definitely be elected. If so, when other members make excessive noise at future meetings, Duclos will come forward as Deputy Speaker to warn them. This can be said to be an innovation in the history of the French Parliament (in previous parliaments, Communist members made the most noise and were often warned by the Speaker and Deputy Speakers). (1st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the new French Parliament officially opened today, a demonstration for women's suffrage took place. Before the opening, many women carried placards with slogans such as "Congratulations to the Government on its Success, but Do Not Forget Women" and gathered around the Chamber of Deputies. When Charles (age 76), the oldest member of parliament, finished his speech, many women in the gallery suddenly displayed placards on the walls with the words "French Women Must Have the Right to Vote." Extremely left-wing members of parliament cheered and supported this movement, but ushers rushed to the gallery and tore down the placards. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate reconvened at 3:10 PM today. Speaker Jananet, Prime Minister Sarraut, Minister Without Portfolio Pengou, and Minister of Public Works Sudant were all present in the cabinet seats. The meeting began with the Speaker's opening remarks, expressing condolences for the late Senator and former Finance Minister Cheron. All members listened quietly. The Speaker then read out various reports. Many women's rights activists held a demonstration and distributed leaflets in the gallery, demanding the right to vote. At the same time, the Speaker continued to read the reports. The demonstrators left the meeting voluntarily without waiting for the adjournment. The Speaker then adjourned the meeting at 3:25 PM.

<p>(Paris) The cabinet will soon be officially formed. According to information obtained by our correspondent, the following are the candidates: Léon Blum, leader of the orthodox Socialist Party, will definitely accept the mandate to form the cabinet, but he is unwilling to take on a ministerial portfolio due to the onerous duties of the Prime Minister. In addition, there will be two new features in the organization of the new cabinet: The merger of the three departments of Navy, Army and Air Force into a Ministry of National Defense, which will be headed by the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, former Prime Minister Daladier, who will also serve as Deputy Prime Minister (originally Minister of Justice concurrently). Underneath, there will be three Deputy Ministers, responsible for Army, Navy and Air Force affairs respectively, to be held by Radical Socialist Party members Lucas, Camponissi, and Cote (former Minister of Aviation). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be renamed as the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Affairs", to be held by the current Minister of Justice and Deputy Prime Minister Delbos (Radical Socialist Party). Underneath, there will be two Secretaries, one to be held by Republican Socialist Union MP Veyrières, specializing in the affairs of French North African territories, and one to be held by Radical Socialist Party MP Tedeschi or Party MP Mochet, specializing in the affairs of overseas colonies. Other appointments include Socialist Party MP Olivet as Minister of Finance, Socialist Party MP Salengro as Minister of Interior, and Radical Socialist Party MP Cadeau (current Secretary-General of the State Council) as Secretary. Socialist Party MP Monnet will be Minister of Agriculture, with Ms. Le Carre as Secretary. Socialist Party member Simand will be Minister of Commerce, and Socialist Party member Dassot will be Minister of Merchant Marine. It is generally believed that the new cabinet will also set up three Ministers Without Portfolio, one for Socialist Party Secretary-General Fauré, one for the current Minister of Public Works and Radical Socialist Party Senator Sudant, and one for Republican Socialist Union Senator Pengou. Among them, Sudant has not fully accepted, and Pengou will continue to serve as the permanent representative to the League of Nations. Although this list may be subject to change in the future, the main outline of the pre-selected candidates for the new Prime Minister, Léon Blum, will be no more than this. (2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Beijing: Following the Belgian general election, in which the Socialist Party achieved a resounding victory, Prime Minister Theunis submitted his cabinet's resignation. Theunis has declined the order to form a new cabinet. It is widely believed that the elder statesman of the Belgian Socialist Party, Paul-Henri Spaak, will be appointed as the new Prime Minister. At a meeting last night, Spaak briefly outlined the new government's work, which will focus on blocking the rise of Fascism and expanding economic reform policies. Spaak, aged seventy, rose to prominence in his youth. At nineteen, he earned a doctorate in law. Nine years later, he became a member of the Socialist Party in Parliament and quickly became a key figure, responsible for reorganizing the party. Today, it is one of the most well-organized in Europe. Socialist Party members deeply respect him, calling him "The Leader."

<p>Evidence of Contact Between China and Kazakhstan</p>
<p>Moscow Correspondence: The research team of the Kazakhstan Research Association has discovered valuable artifacts, proving that Kazakhstan and ancient China had contact. They discovered stone statues of women, warriors, and lions in several pastures, carved from brown hard stone. These artifacts date back thousands of years, and their style indicates that they were created by ancient Chinese artists. The most interesting find is a bronze mirror, also an ancient Chinese artifact. The back of the mirror features bas-relief carvings of flowers, leaves, hair, Chinese ducks, and butterflies, as well as Chinese characters. Metallurgists have found that the mirror is extremely hard, almost impossible to damage with a knife or file, yet ancient Chinese artists were able to create intricate carvings on this hard alloy.

<p>(Nanjing) The railway bureau and customs have reported in detail via telegram about the situation of Japanese and Korean ruffians smuggling goods and forcing transport on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Details are as follows: The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau reported that according to the report from the Transportation Department on May 27, two carriages of rayon from the East Station to Jinan on the 26th lacked customs permits and a request was made via telegram asking for instructions. On the morning of the 27th, more than 20 Japanese and Korean ruffians came and acted with extreme barbarity and were unreasonable. It was impossible to restrain them and they were determined to forcibly remove the goods. However, the customs inspector Ye Yuchun had not yet arrived in Jinan. The Japanese Consulate dispatched Nakanishi Takeo to the station to negotiate, signing a certificate and promising to take all responsibility, stating that if this was not done, they would simply allow them to cause trouble and the consulate would not be responsible. As a result, the goods were taken. Also, according to a telegram from Tianjin Main Station on May 28, on the 27th, 50 Japanese and Korean people brought 105 bundles of untaxed rayon and 30 pieces of cigarette paper and forcibly boarded Train No. 305. Also, according to a telegram from Jinan on May 28, on the 28th, more than 10 Japanese and Korean people carrying more than 130 pieces of rayon and cigarette paper unloaded them from the third-class passenger carriage of train No. 305 and forcibly ordered coolies to carry them out of the station, behaving rudely and not listening to orders. Also, according to a telegram from Xuzhou on May 28, on the night of the 27th, train No. 401 arrived at the station with carriages of sugar transported from the East Station to Shangqiu, two carriages from the Beining Railway weighing 20 tons, carriage numbers 1532 and 1466, all without customs documents. Customs officer Wang Zuomin had not yet arrived in Xuzhou, asking for instructions on how to handle the matter. Also, according to a telegram from Bengbu on May 28, this morning, a Japanese man, Nagatani Eifuku, and two Korean men, Pak Sam-cheol and Jang Byeong-cheol, presented whole carriage freight tickets for white sugar from Tianjin East Station, intending to pay and take delivery of the goods. The Jinling customs officers Li Guang and Xie Zhuohuang negotiated and, because they had no customs documents, refused to allow them to take delivery of the goods and were being detained. The Jinling Customs Supervisor's Office also has the same report on the above situation. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jinling Customs reported to the Ministry of Finance the details of the seizure of smuggled sugar in Bengbu, stating that on May 23, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau telegraphed that the Transportation Department reported that there was a large amount of smuggled sugar being transported from Tianjin to Bengbu and requested that personnel be dispatched to inspect and deal with it. They immediately dispatched customs officers to Bengbu to investigate. On the morning of May 24, 2,833 bags of foreign sugar were seized in Bengbu. Subsequently, on the 25th, another 577 bags were seized. On the 26th, another 840 bags were seized. To date, a total of about 300 tons of smuggled sugar have been seized. All of them are currently in the Bengbu Railway Station freight yard. Because no one has claimed them, customs officers are temporarily monitoring them, awaiting investigation.

After the Japanese troops landed, from 1:25 p.m. on the same day and 2:05 p.m., they took two special trains on the Beining Railway and went to Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao. The first train carried 150 infantry and 60 cavalry, the second train carried 300 infantry and artillery, hundreds of pieces of baggage, and 8 cannons. Both trains arrived at their destinations at 10:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. respectively. The third special train left Tanggu at 5:30 p.m., carrying more than 240 cavalry, 240 horses, 8 cannons, and more than 500 pieces of military supplies. It arrived in Tianjin at 6:30 p.m. and stopped at the East Station. The commander of the Japanese army, Tashiro, led senior staff officer Tadayasu Taro, senior adjutant Kawata Tsui Taro, and the staff of the headquarters to welcome them at the station. Consul Kishii, President of the Residents' Association Morikawa Teruta, the International Women's Association, the Veterans' Association, and Japanese elementary school students, totaling more than 1,000 people, also went to the station to wave flags to welcome them. The newly arrived Japanese army, commanded by Captain Noguchi, except for 140 people who got off the train and entered the Hekogji Japanese army camp, the rest returned to the original train and went to Fengtai at 7:15 p.m. The fourth special train left Tanggu at 7:10 p.m., carrying 520 infantry and 14 horses. It arrived at Tianjin Station at 8:20 p.m. The Japanese commander Tashiro still led his staff and overseas Chinese to welcome them. Among the troops, there were 320 people, led by Fukuda, who got off the train and marched into the newly built Japanese barracks in Li Mingzhuang, Dongjuzi, and the remaining 150 people left on the original train at 8:30 p.m. and went to Beiping and then to Tongzhou. The fifth special train was originally scheduled to arrive at 11:30 p.m. on the 29th, but because of the railway explosion between Tanggu and Tianjin, it was blocked at the dam and postponed to the 30th. It was changed to two trains and arrived in Tianjin at 5:50 a.m., carrying 550 infantry, 12 cannons, and countless military supplies. When it arrived at Tianjin East Station, 350 people got off the train and went to the Li Mingzhuang barracks, and 200 people left on the original train at 6:20 a.m. and went to Beiping. The sixth train arrived in Tianjin at 9:50 a.m. on the 30th, carrying a lot of military supplies, seven tanks of various sizes, five armored vehicles, three heavy-duty vehicles, and 4,000 gas masks, escorted by 50 infantrymen. When they arrived in Tianjin, they stopped at the station and were transported to the Hekogji and Dongjuzi Japanese army camps. According to the investigation, the new army sent from April 13, May 14, 15, 29, and 30, in addition to those staying in Tianjin, together with the teams landed from Qindao Yuguan, Tanggu, totaling more than 5,000 people, of which more than 1,800 people belonged to the troop rotation team, and the rest were so-called strengthening teams, which was still far from the number of a division stipulated by the Japanese military department. It was originally planned to arrive successively after June 5, but recently, because of the attention of Europe and the United States, and because of the proposal of our central government, although the Japanese side did not pay attention, it also did not want the world to know its military actions, so it declared to the outside world that the transportation of the new army had ended on the 29th, and would not come again in the future, but it was slightly heard that after the air eased slightly, it would use other methods to transport them continuously, so before mid-July, the Japanese troops stationed in North China would reach about 12,000, once the Guantai new barracks were completed, or it would be the time to complete this matter. On the night of the 29th, the fifth train of Japanese troops was originally scheduled to depart from Tanggu at 10:30 p.m. and arrive in Tianjin at 11:30 p.m. At 10:00 p.m., the Japanese military department sent a captain of the infantry, leading 38 armed soldiers, to the East Station to ask the Beining Road stationmaster to borrow a ballast car, open it to Xinhe, check the tracks, and meet the fifth train of soldiers. The stationmaster asked the transportation department for instructions, which said that the ballast car was dedicated to railway workers and could not be easily lent, and allowed only a special train to be attached. The Japanese army agreed, and the road party temporarily compiled and attached an engine and a first, second, and third class passenger car. At 10:10 p.m., it departed from the East Station. When it was about to leave the station, 20 Japanese civilians came and went with the car. The train was commanded by the Japanese captain all the way, stopping and stopping from time to time. The Japanese army and civilians also went up and down from time to time, seeming to check the track. Usually, a passenger train from Tianjin East Station to Zhang Guizhuang only takes ten minutes, but on this night, it took forty minutes to arrive. After entering the station, the Japanese captain instructed to stop moving forward immediately, saying that there was no need to go to Xinhe again, and wait until 4 a.m. on the 30th to return to Tianjin. Then the Japanese army and the Japanese civilians were divided into several groups, measuring the bridges and tracks with tape measures. After that, they gradually went farther and farther, and returned to Tianjin on foot until about 2 a.m. on the 30th. At 11:35 p.m., while the Japanese army was surveying near Zhang Guizhuang, suddenly a railway track one kilometer away from Tianjin East Station was suddenly blown up, two sleepers were broken, the rails were bent, and the track was blown into two deep pits. Zhang Guizhuang Station inspectors heard the sound and rushed to inspect it. Seeing that the track was destroyed, they rushed to Tianjin Station to report it. At that time, the first train to Pingjing had already departed from the East Station and was warned and stopped by the inspectors who rushed. The train then returned to Tianjin. The railway bureau also informed the Japanese military headquarters after receiving the report. The headquarters then sent staff officer Hayashi to accompany the staff of the transportation department of the railway bureau to the site for investigation and investigation of responsibility. The staff officer took a video on the spot and took it back to report. After the explosion on the railway track, the East Station was guarded by the Japanese military department with the assistance of the military police, monitoring the actions of the road staff and not allowing passengers to get on and off. It was not until after 3 a.m. on the 30th that the Japanese military department allowed the workers to go to the bombed area for repairs after negotiations with the railway bureau. The Japanese military headquarters then sent several armed soldiers to patrol near Zhang Guizhuang, not allowing pedestrians to pass and searching for suspects. At 4:50 a.m., traffic was restored, and the Japanese army's vigilance was slightly relaxed. The departure of the Pingjing train was delayed for five hours. At 5:10 a.m. on the 30th, it departed from Tianjin East. The Beining Railway Bureau immediately reported the matter to Pingfang after the incident. Sun Jidong, the director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, was also invited to talk by Fujii, the commander of the Japanese military police, on the night of the 29th, saying that when the fourth train of Japanese soldiers arrived in Tianjin, communist leaflets opposing the arrival of the Japanese army were found at the East Station at 8:20 p.m. on the 29th, and the Chinese side was aware of it in advance. Sun said he did not know, and Fujii asked Sun to pay attention. Sun returned to the bureau and immediately summoned the director of the third special district public security bureau to inquire and order an investigation into whether the Communist Party was distributing leaflets at the station. According to the investigation report, there was no such thing. When the railway track was destroyed, the Japanese side pointed out that it was done by undisciplined elements. At 9:00 a.m. on the 30th, Sugai, a captain of the Japanese military police, came to the Tianjin County Public Security Bureau to visit Bai Lunbi, the chief of the public security section, on the order of Tashiro, and inquired about the matter, believing that the area belonged to Tianjin County, and the bureau should be responsible. He went to visit Liu Jia, the Tianjin Security Commander, for instructions in the afternoon. Liu asked the Beining Road, the Municipal Government, and the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, but none of them had received any expressions from the Japanese side. In addition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau feeling that the responsibility for the area did not belong exclusively to the county bureau, it had ordered the third public security bureau to arrest the intruders within three days. On the one hand, the Security Command was assisting various agencies in investigating the truth and arresting the criminals, and on the other hand, it was carefully defending to avoid further incidents. Because of this incident, rumors spread in Tianjin, people were panicked, and there was a sense of unease. (May 30)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Song Zheyuan Convenes Cadre Meeting <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Stabilizing the Local Area and Coping with the Current Situation. The Main Purpose Is to Maintain Sovereignty</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, the situation in Hebei and Chahar, since the Hebei-East problem has been unresolved for a long time, the diplomatic situation has gradually entered a state of silence, but in the recent half month, Japan has greatly increased its troops in North China, which has attracted the attention of all parties and the panic of Pingjin. Tianjin students marched on May 28, and students in Ping city also held gatherings, while ignorant people took the opportunity to spread rumors in Tianjin, causing people to become restless. Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, in order to stabilize the local area and cope with the current situation, specially convened cadres of the 29th Army at the private residence in Wuyiku Hutong on the evening of the 30th to discuss everything until late at night before dispersing. More than ten people, including Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Xiao Zhenying, Feng Zhian, Liu Ruming, and Zhang Yueting, attended. In addition to making decisions on maintaining public order, they also discussed in detail the attitude they should take, and unanimously decided to safeguard national sovereignty. During the meeting, Xiao Zhenying's intention to resign as Tianjin mayor was unanimously retained, and Song ordered Xiao to return to Tianjin on the same day to dispel rumors. After receiving the order, Xiao went to Tianjin by car with Zhang Zizhong, chairman of Chahar, and Ren Yuandao, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, at 8 p.m. on the 31st, and Xiao will return to Ping again in two or three days.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan's Talk</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan met with the press at 6 p.m. on the 30th, with a calm attitude, and talked in detail about the current situation. Here is a brief note on the left, "The Hebei-Chahar area has recently been plagued by rumors and unrest due to the increase of Japanese troops, which are all not credible. There has been no progress in the diplomatic situation. On the 28th and 29th, Matsumuro had two decisions to meet with me. The first day's discussion was about the international situation after the European War, and the second day's discussion was only Matsumuro's statement that he was responsible for the diplomatic negotiations, and nothing else was mentioned. On the 30th, I was supposed to meet again, but the meeting was canceled because Matsumuro did not visit. A Japanese newspaper in Tianjin on the 30th published a news item "Warning Song Zheyuan", and I intend to question him about it immediately. The point of contention in the Hebei-Chahar incident is the issue of sovereignty. All incidents can be discussed under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and I have also explained to the other party that Chinese sovereignty must be respected. For example, the Japanese embassy police arrested two young men in the old Ministry of Punishments Street in Xidan the other day, which is an infringement of our national sovereignty. After negotiations, the two men have been released. As for the crackdown on the trafficking of drugs by Japanese and Korean vagrants, it has been resolved. All vagrants in the counties have been expelled from the country. As for Japan's increase of troops in North China and the establishment of the brigade headquarters stationed in Ping, the procedures are not in compliance, and I also intend to ask the Japanese side for an explanation. Now our main purpose is to maintain sovereignty. At this critical moment, I sincerely hope that the government will have a solution soon. The student parade does not harm public order, nor does it endanger the lives and property of foreigners, so foreigners have no reason to interfere."</p>
<h3 id="e97">Huainan Railway to Hold Opening Ceremony on June 5th; Simultaneously Commemorating the Sixth Anniversary of the Coal Mine <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Huainan Coal Mine, under the jurisdiction of the National Government's Construction Committee, has seen a significant increase in production and a thriving business in recent years. The Huainan Railway, built for transporting coal, has also been in operation for half a year. The bituminous coal produced by the mine can now be transported daily by rail to Yuxi for storage. Moreover, over 10,000 tons have been transported from the Datong Mine near Kunlian in the past month. As a result, the Yuxi wharf is piled high with coal, and iron ships arrive in a continuous stream for loading. The once desolate Yuxi has now become a prosperous port. With the convenience of transportation provided by the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau, they are determined to develop the coal seams as much as possible. Current daily output exceeds 2,000 tons, and plans are in place to increase it to 4,000 to 5,000 tons, ensuring that the provinces of Central and Southern China will not suffer from a shortage of coal. The mine bureau has decided to combine two ceremonies – the completion of the railway and the sixth anniversary of the coal mine's opening – to be held on June 5th at the Jiulonggang Mine Bureau in Huaiyuan County. Invitees include officials from relevant organizations in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Wuhu, Hankou, Bengbu, major companies, the press, and representatives from various chambers of commerce, totaling over 500 people. Most of them will gather in Wuhu on the 3rd and depart from Yuxi by train on the morning of the 4th to attend the ceremony at the mine. The director of the mine bureau, Cheng Shifan, has already arrived in Yuxi from the bureau by train to prepare for the reception. The local products to be collected and sent along the route number in the hundreds. Their gathering together during the event will undoubtedly add much color to the commemorative meeting. The mine's history, production, railway construction process, and local products along the route are investigated separately as follows:</p>
<p>Coal Mine Development: Mining Area and Location</p>
<p>After the establishment of the National Government Construction Committee, given that Southern China relied on Northern mines for fuel, and since the Central Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Yangtze River basin has seen flourishing industry and commerce, with a concentration of population and an increasing demand for coal. However, most mines in North China were operated with foreign capital, and domestic coal production was limited. In order to promote domestic coal production and supply fuel to the Yangtze River region, the National Government began to research and plan a state-owned coal mine. In the 18th year [of the Republic], the Huainan mining area was surveyed and the Huainan Coal Mine Bureau was established. The mine is located on the south bank of the Huai River in northern Anhui Province, at the intersection of Huaiyuan, Fengtai, and Shou counties, with five mining areas: Jiulonggang, Dongshan, Changshan, Shangyao, and Xinchengkou. The five areas have a total area of over 22 square kilometers, with coal seam outcrops extending for 35 kilometers. Currently, mining is conducted in the Jiulonggang area, which is 52 kilometers in a straight line from Bengbu, 10 kilometers from the Luoyangzhen on the near bank of the Huai River, 10 kilometers by water from Huaiyuan, 35 kilometers from Shou County, and 200 kilometers in a straight line from the Yangtze River. The Dongshan area is six kilometers west of the Jiulonggang area. Drilling in that area has been completed, and well-sinking has commenced. The Datong Coal Mine lies between the Jiulonggang and Dongshan areas. The remaining three areas are all located north of the Jiulonggang area, approximately 12 kilometers away, arranged from southeast to northwest, extending for 17 kilometers.</p>
<p>Transportation and Coal Volume</p>
<p>A narrow-gauge railway, 12 kilometers long, has been built from the Jiulonggang area to Luohe. Coal is transported via this route to Luohezhen, and then by waterway via the Huai River to Bengbu, and from there by the Jinpu Railway to Pukou, for transfer to various ports along the Yangtze River (the freight is over four yuan per ton; with the completion of the Huainan Railway, it will only be two yuan, a reduction of more than one-half). However, when the water level of the Huai River is low in winter, only small boats of 20 to 30 tons can navigate, and there are various restrictions on vehicles and freight rates on the Jinpu Railway. With high costs, monthly shipments are less than 20,000 tons. Therefore, the mine cannot be developed without opening a railway to the Yangtze River. Thus, the idea of building a railway to the Yangtze River was present from the very beginning. However, due to the enormous costs and difficulty in raising funds, work was delayed until the spring of the 23rd year [of the Republic]. Construction was divided into four sections, and the line was opened to Chaoxian in September of the 24th year and fully opened in January of the 25th year. One can travel from the mine to the riverside from morning until evening, and all the transportation difficulties of the past can be eliminated. Regarding the reserves of the Huainan coalfield, opinions vary. A survey conducted by the Academia Sinica in the 21st year [of the Republic] found that the Jiulonggang mining area is 4,600 meters long. Assuming a mining depth of 1,000 meters and a specific gravity of 1.3 for the coal, the reserves are estimated at 71,700,000 tons. The Dongshan area is 2,800 meters long, with reserves of 43,700,000 tons, totaling 115,400,000 tons. Currently, the rock tunnel only penetrates 200 meters of the coal system, and there is the possibility of discovering new coal seams in the future. If we assume that half of the currently identified coal volume can be discovered in the future, then the two areas will have a total of 170,000,000 tons of coal. If we take 60% of this figure as the recoverable amount, there would still be 101,000,000 tons. If we consider half of that amount, the mine would have at least 50 million tons of coal available for extraction. The coal produced is high-volatile bituminous coal. According to tests conducted by the Fuel Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey, it is a low-carbon bituminous coal, suitable for burning in boilers and for producing coal gas. When mixed with medium-carbon bituminous coal, it can produce good metallurgical coke. Huainan coal is also suitable for low-temperature coking. According to research by the laboratory, each ton can yield more than 30 gallons of coal tar, a rare achievement among bituminous coals in the country. Currently, there are two well-sinking sites in the Jiulonggang mining area, one in the east plant and one in the west plant. The two plants are 16 kilometers apart. The coal currently sold is produced by both the east and west plants.</p>

<p>For the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Day, the county government convened a meeting of various agencies and decided that at 8:00 AM on that day, all civil servants from various agencies would gather at the commissioner's office to form a parade and march through the streets. The confiscated smoking paraphernalia from closed cases was put on display at the First District Office from the day before, for public viewing. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the paraphernalia was burned at the small drill field. The anti-smoking speech competition for primary and secondary school students was held on the 1st and 2nd at the People's Education Hall, Yue Temple, and People's Library respectively, with a large audience. Prizes were awarded in the afternoon, with the prizes being donated by various agencies.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Suggestions for Widening Streets <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since the introduction of rickshaws to the city, the streets have become quite narrow. The county government discussed this issue at a policy meeting, agreeing that Zhongshan Street is the most prosperous area of the city, and that Changqiao Street and Fayuan South Street are important thoroughfares for automobile traffic, and all need to be widened. It was stipulated that the road surface be widened to seven meters, and the plan of "straightening by cutting off bends" was not adopted to avoid excessive losses. The existing shape of the road will be maintained, and half of the houses on both the upper and lower banks will be demolished. If there are no houses to be demolished on the lower bank, then the upper bank will be demolished. However, the government will form an evaluation committee, and the residents on the lower bank will compensate the land price to make up for the losses on the upper bank. After the resolution was passed, it was submitted to the provincial authorities for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Suzhou: All Cocoon Markets Open for Business <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Silkworm raising in various villages in Wuxian County has finished. Cocoon markets in places like Guangfu, Mudu, Shanrenqiao, Hengjing, and Dongshan have all opened for business and are purchasing fresh cocoons. The latest to open is in the West Dongting Mountain, scheduled to open on the 3rd to purchase cocoons. The Wuxian Silkworm Improvement Farm is concerned that private white cocoon smugglers may obstruct operations, so they dispatched a large number of inspectors to various villages on the 2nd to investigate. The price of cocoons is uniformly based on the resolution of the Wuxian Cocoon Industry Association, with improved varieties priced at 30 yuan as the standard and local varieties at 20 yuan. According to people in the cocoon industry, this year's cocoon production is very good, with an average yield of about 90%. However, because the price of mulberry leaves soared a week ago, silkworm farmers suffered heavy losses, so even though the harvest is good, they are still complaining.</p>

<p>Zhang Shizhu, who works as a lawyer for the Shanghai police, has a wife, Ms. Zheng, who lives on Nanhao Street outside the Changmen gate in Suzhou. Because Zhang Shizhu has another lover in Shanghai, the relationship between husband and wife is strained. Zhang Shizhu came to Suzhou a month ago, and a misunderstanding in their conversation led to a conflict with his wife, Ms. Zheng, who was beaten and injured by Zhang. Ms. Zheng went to the Wuxian District Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday to have her injuries examined and accused Zhang of assault. Prosecutor Zhang opened a court session to investigate the case and ordered an official to examine the injuries. Ms. Zheng was ordered to return home, and a summons was immediately issued for Zhang Shizhu to appear in court on the 4th to answer the charges.</p>

<p>In Shazhou City, a riot was incited by a group of people under the pretense of opposing the dredging of the Second Main Canal. The rioters gathered and broke the river dams, destroyed the project, and destroyed the township head's residence and his private hospital. They also fought with the security team sent to suppress the riot, resulting in the authorities sending a large force to the village, where they captured 12 ringleaders and sent them to the Wuxi District Security Command for military trial. The situation was finally brought under control. However, the masterminds who incited the riot, such as Tan Jiujin, were still at large. On the evening of the 31st, the Shazhou Public Security Bureau received a tip that the masterminds were hiding in the countryside. The bureau, together with 120 members of the local security team, surrounded the village and arrested the masterminds Ding Shishu and Chen Bajin. Tan Jiujin is still at large. The two arrested criminals were sent to the county on the 2nd and will be transferred to Wuxi for strict punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Two Years of Jiangsu's Anti-Smoking Efforts "Part 1" <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jingtang</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In the spring of the 23rd year [of the Republic], the Jiangsu Provincial Government formulated the Outline of the Jiangsu Province Limited-Term Anti-Smoking Measures, stipulating that general smokers must quit within four years in stages, while civil servants addicted to smoking were ordered to quit within one month. In the summer of the same year, the Provincial Government meeting passed the Organizational Regulations of the Jiangsu Province Anti-Smoking Committee, establishing eleven members, with a secretary underneath, divided into four sections: General Affairs, Investigation and Arrest, Licensing, and Auditing. Each section was headed by a section chief to preside over the anti-smoking affairs of the province. Each county also established a County Anti-Smoking Committee, with the county magistrate as the chairman, and also appointed a secretary, divided into four sections: General Affairs, Investigation and Arrest, Licensing, and Auditing. Each section had a chief. This is the general organizational structure of the provincial and county anti-smoking committees. The anti-smoking policy was implemented under the provincial and county anti-smoking committees for one year and three months. In August of the 24th year, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, anti-smoking affairs were divided into two departments: supervision and execution. The supervisory body was the provincial and county anti-smoking committees. The provincial execution matters were handled by the fifth section added to the Department of Civil Affairs, and the county execution matters were handled by the anti-smoking section added to the county government. All anti-smoking laws and regulations remained the same, striving to be effective in order to achieve the goal of complete prohibition as scheduled. Almost another ten months have passed. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Day in the 25th year, the past processing of the matters are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Registration of Smokers</p>
<p>The province has conducted a total of three registration efforts. The first effort was a general registration, which took place in the summer and autumn of the 23rd year, lasting four months, registering a total of 184,980 smokers. In the winter of the same year, a supplementary registration was conducted for one month, registering 12,708 smokers. This spring, another self-renewal registration of smokers was conducted, lasting one and a half months, registering 105,858 smokers. The above three registrations totaled 303,546 smokers. Among them, 17,445 people were unable to obtain licenses and were sent to the addiction treatment center for free detoxification. There were 6,920 people who died or moved and could not be ordered to obtain licenses. The actual number of licensed individuals was 279,181, of which 27,264 held Class A licenses and 251,917 held Class B licenses.</p>
<p>2.  Establishment of Addiction Treatment Hospitals and Centers</p>
<p>When the province began implementing the anti-smoking policy in the 23rd year, it planned to establish addiction treatment hospitals and centers in each county. In October of the same year, a provincial addiction treatment hospital was established in the provincial capital, also handling addiction treatment affairs in Zhenjiang, with an initial operating cost of 3,500 yuan and monthly operating expenses of 2,000 yuan. At the same time, in order to research the standards and methods of addiction treatment and investigation, a research department was attached to the provincial hospital, hiring experts to specialize in the matter. The other sixty counties also established addiction treatment centers one after another in November of the 23rd year, with an average initial operating cost of 1,500 yuan per center and average monthly operating expenses of 500 yuan per center. Subsequently, because each county's addiction treatment center admitted, treated, forcibly treated, and investigated drug offenders, with an average of more than 150 people per month, the original number of beds, instruments, medicines, and other facilities related to treatment, investigation, and entertainment were insufficient. After investigation, expansion was granted according to the actual local conditions. It is now estimated that the capacity of addiction treatment hospitals and centers in the province can accommodate 5,327 smokers at the same time. Considering that there are two batches per month, it can accommodate 10,654 people. Moreover, since the local finances of each county in the province are strained and county hospitals have not been generally established, and those that have been established still lack content and equipment, in order to promote local medical and health care universally, it was ordered that all those with previously established county hospitals whose equipment was already relatively complete should uniformly establish internal and surgical clinics within the addiction treatment centers. The required initial and operating expenses are to be allocated from the addiction treatment income. It is now estimated that a total of 17 counties, including Danyang and Yangzhong, have been established, and 30 counties, including Binying, are actively preparing to do so.</p>
<p>3.  Forced Addiction Treatment for Smokers</p>
<p>The province has a large number of licensed smokers, and it is difficult for addiction treatment hospitals and centers to admit and treat them all at once. Therefore, based on the Outline of the Limited-Term Anti-Smoking Measures, an addiction treatment year was stipulated and a planned, batch-by-batch forced addiction treatment was implemented. It began on October 1st of the 23rd year, in stages of four years, with a requirement to treat at least one-quarter of the total number of registered smokers each year. As for the order of priority of the batch-by-batch treatment, it was stipulated that those under the age of 30 should be treated later, in the first year; those between 31 and 40 years of age should be treated in the second year; those between 41 and 50 years of age should be treated in the third year; and those over 51 years of age should be treated in the fourth year. If the target of one-quarter is not reached in one year, the smokers who should be treated in the next year should be treated in advance to make up the quarter. The standards for the order of priority and advance treatment of the smokers to be treated in the same year are as follows: 1. Those with younger ages are prioritized; 2. If the ages are the same, those with lighter smoking habits are prioritized; 3. If the ages and smoking habits are the same, the county decides. The list of smokers to be treated in each batch must be announced at least two weeks in advance and notified separately, and a copy must be reported to the province for record. Once a licensed smoker is notified for addiction treatment, their license will become invalid from the date of notification. Those who refuse to be treated after the deadline will be detained and forcibly treated. Smokers in the province have been undergoing forced addiction treatment since October of the 23rd year. Excluding those who died or moved and could not be treated, a total of 94,224 smokers have been treated as of April of this year. Moreover, 2,528 smokers were undergoing treatment in April.</p>
<p>4.  Training and Relief for Smokers</p>
<p>According to the current anti-smoking situation in the province, it has been possible to unify and manage smokers and implement treatment within a limited time. However, those who voluntarily enter for treatment are sincere, and can they stop resuming smoking after being released? Smokers are generally weak and mostly poor and helpless. How to provide relief after treatment has become an important issue. Therefore, in the winter of the 23rd year, a training program for smokers was formulated. Last year, a savings program and smoker factories were also established to seek remedies. The training program is divided into knowledge training, individual talks, spiritual lectures, physical exercise, labor, reflection, self-government training, entertainment, and other items. Among them, knowledge training, individual talks, and spiritual lectures are given by members of the county anti-smoking committee, personnel from other agencies, and the director and doctors of the center. As for livelihood relief, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has a savings incentive program for smokers, and the province has established smoker factories in districts. Since April of last year, one factory has been established in each district of Nantong, Tongshan, and Yancheng (the Yancheng factory is not yet fully established). These factories are larger in scale and require more funding, so they cannot be established universally at once. In addition, Wujin has established a smoker skills training workshop, and Zhenjiang has established a smoker rehabilitation center (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e106">Today's "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Commemoration: All Sectors Hold a Meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce; National Anti-Drug Association Issues a Painful Declaration <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 97th anniversary of "June 3rd," and the National Government has designated this day as Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day. The city party headquarters will hold a commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM today, gathering people from all sectors of the city. The presidium has nominated eleven institutions and organizations: the city party headquarters, the city government, the garrison command, the public security bureau, the reporting commissioner's office, the anti-smoking committee, the National Anti-Drug Association, the city farmers' association, the general labor union, the city education association, and the city chamber of commerce. After the commemorative meeting, a mass rally will be held at the Tianhou Palace open space to burn opium, drugs, and smoking paraphernalia. To expand publicity, celebrities from all walks of life have been specially invited to give speeches on the radio about anti-smoking and anti-drug efforts. Those invited include Mayor Wu, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Yang Hu, Wu Xingya, Ma Liang, Cai Jinjun, Li Tingan, Tong Hangbai, Jiang Huaishu, Cai Hongtian, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others. At the same time, major daily newspapers throughout the city will publish special anti-smoking supplements, and all institutions, organizations, and schools throughout the city will celebrate by hanging flags. When performers present their art, they will intersperse anti-smoking propaganda to attract public attention.</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association, commemorating the 97th anniversary of Commissioner Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen today, in addition to coordinating with various institutions and organizations in the city to hold a grand commemoration at the City Chamber of Commerce, has also issued the Anti-Drug Monthly and the June 3rd Commemorative Special in advance, and notified anti-drug organizations across the country to step up the anti-drug movement and carry out large-scale publicity to awaken the public. The association's commemorative declaration is recorded below: "Today is the 97th anniversary of the burning of opium at Humen by the anti-smoking pioneer Lin Wenzhong Gong. We recall our predecessors and look at the difficulties of the time, feeling a sense of emotion. The decline of our national strength, the poverty of the people, the rampant foreign aggression, and the shrinking of our territory are all rooted in the scourge of opium. Lin Zexu saw this in those days and could not bear to see the spread of opium and the shaking of the national foundation. He stood alone against all opposition and vigorously advocated anti-smoking efforts, even daring to fight against the British. His spirit of safeguarding national rights and preserving national territory is the supreme glory of our nation and should be admired by all generations and admired by all nations. Looking back today, the decline of our national strength and the rampant foreign aggression are even worse than in the past. Those who are scheming to destroy our country and exterminate our nation are protecting vagrant scoundrels to spread drugs everywhere as a prelude to aggression. The facts are all there and cannot be denied. The large-scale opium production and public sale in the four northeastern provinces, the mass production of drugs, and the encouragement of smoking have long been seen by the world and need no further explanation. Recently, in counties in eastern Hebei and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin, Japanese and Korean vagrants have set up trading houses everywhere and openly sell drugs. They can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys. Fuzhou and Xiamen, close to Taiwan, are even more unspeakable because of the rampant drug scourge. The concessions in Hankou are filled with drug factories, producing more than 10,000 catties each year. The corners of the Hongkou district in northern Shanghai are also studded with opium dens and drug shops, all of which destroy the livelihood of our people and cut through the bodies of our people. All of these have been investigated and revealed by the association. Recently, representatives from various countries have spoken out for justice at the League of Nations General Assembly, advocating for its eradication. It is clear that justice is on our side and cannot be concealed, which is gratifying. However, the flow of poison has spread so widely and penetrated so deeply into society. How can we stand idly by and ignore it? The government has now made a determined plan to ban smoking, and the international community is also showing good intentions to help, so the responsibility for clearing drugs lies with the efforts of our people. We must know that if the scourge of drugs is not eliminated for a single day, our country's smoking ban will never be able to achieve its goal. If the scourge of drugs is not eliminated for a single day, the Chinese nation will never have the hope of turning itself around. People are scheming to harm us. Seizing cities and land is not enough, and now they are using this deadly drug to destroy our country and exterminate our race. In order to survive, we should rise up and follow the example of Lin Gong, unite our forces, and fight this drug to the death. We also hope that government leaders will see themselves as Lin Gong, rise up to defend our territory, and clear away drugs, lest our beautiful land be lost to others and all 400 million people become opium addicts. Then today's commemoration will be in vain. This is our declaration."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Committee for Raising Funds to Present the Government with Aircraft in Commemoration of Chairman Chiang’s Fiftieth Birthday, initiated by the municipal government and its affiliated agencies, as well as various organizations, schools, and guilds, held its first tea party yesterday. Attendees included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau Xu Fu, Secretary Wang Zhinan of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Tong Xingbai of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhou Xuexiang of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Yu Zuoting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai of the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, Gu Xinyi of the Food Grain Industry Guild, and representatives from the National Medical Association, the National Pharmaceutical Association, the Glass Industry Guild, the Liang Shaojiu (Liquor) Industry Guild, the Tu Huangjiu (Local Yellow Wine) Industry Guild, the Carpet Industry Guild, the Western Tobacco Industry Guild, the Universities Joint Association, the Performing Arts Joint Association, the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, the China Vocational Education Society, the Hebei Fellow-Villagers Association, the Hubei Fellow-Villagers Association, the Fujian Fellow-Villagers Association, the Guangdong Fellow-Villagers Association, the Central Bank, the Silk Industry Bank, the International Law and Trade Association, the Municipal Museum, the First Special District Local Court, and others, as well as Huang Jinrong, Zhao Jinqing, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Xiaolin, and more than three hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>The meeting was held in the restaurant on the ninth floor of the YMCA. In the center were the flags of the Party and the nation and the emblem of the China Aviation Association, along with photos from past aircraft purchase and naming ceremonies. The hall was filled with Party and national flags, creating a magnificent and solemn atmosphere. The presidium consisted of Wang Xiaolai, Wu Tiecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Shouyong, and Yu Zuoting, with Chen Shuo as the recorder. After the meeting began, Wang Xiaolai delivered an opening speech, stating that all circles in Shanghai had initiated a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. He expressed gratitude for the presence of so many guests to discuss the progress. He said that various countries in the world that adhere to a single ideology, support a single leader, and work together wholeheartedly are invariably strong. Chairman Chiang is our national leader who toils for the country. All our people should support him wholeheartedly. Therefore, raising funds to purchase aircraft is a demonstration of public opinion. He hoped that everyone would work together under the leadership of Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating that since Shanghai initiated the movement to "Use Aviation to Save the Nation" two years ago, it had inspired a nationwide surge of enthusiasm. It not only awakened the national public's passion for saving the nation through aviation but also made the national public realize that building an air force is the fundamental and most crucial task of national defense construction today. Shanghai's first fundraising campaign two years ago achieved a result of over 1.3 million yuan, purchasing 18 aircraft and donating them to the government. Last year, the Aviation Association resolved to launch a second campaign. This year also marks Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. Therefore, the association invited people from all walks of life to launch a fundraising campaign, simultaneously notifying the whole country to hold it together. Up to now, Shanghai has raised over 200,000 yuan, and counting reports from all over, the total is expected to reach 4 million yuan. Shanghai plans to raise 1 million yuan, purchase ten fighters, form them into a squadron, and present them to the government as a birthday memorial for Chairman Chiang. Today, we have invited leaders from all walks of life to participate in discussing fundraising methods so that we can achieve our goal as scheduled. Currently, there are over 280 organizations and 371 individuals who have joined the initiative, and more continue to join. This enthusiastic participation proves that the citizens have recognized the urgency of air force construction. With this enthusiastic atmosphere, 1 million yuan should not be difficult to raise. Our national crisis did not begin today, but it is becoming increasingly serious. Empty talk of saving the nation will only lead to fruitless labor. It is hoped that we will firmly believe in one ideology, namely the Three Principles of the People, and support the leader with one heart and one mind, putting our lives on the line. Only then will saving the nation have practical meaning and power, and the national crisis can be resolved.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai then reported that twelve fundraising methods had been established, and he hoped that everyone would express their opinions as much as possible. He now intended to report the pledges from various parties: the Food Grain Guild pledged to donate one aircraft, the Exchange Association pledged to donate one aircraft, Tao Guilin donated 1,000 yuan, the entire staff of the Municipal Public Security Bureau jointly donated 11,000 yuan, the Western Pharmaceutical Guild donated 1,000 yuan, the Municipal Bank Association donated 10,000 yuan, and the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association is currently planning to raise 100,000 yuan. In the future, meetings will be convened every half month to report progress. As for the methods, ten levels such as Heaven, Earth, Central, and Righteous are stipulated. It is hoped that schools and organizations will raise funds on their own and contact the China Aviation Association and the Recruitment Team Leader's Office at any time. If there are slight discrepancies with the specified levels and numbers, it will not be a problem. It is only hoped that everyone will work hard to make pledges and achieve the goal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fundraising Announcement</p>
<p>The committee's fundraising announcement stated: "Respectfully addressing you, the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the summer Zheng Dinghai year (October 29th) is the fiftieth birthday of the current President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The people of the whole country are dancing and singing in celebration. In ancient times, when celebrating someone's birthday, people composed poems and songs, transmitted praises, offered jade and silk to express their sincerity, or presented garments to convey their best wishes. Nowadays, these have become common practices. However, Mr. Chiang is dedicated to public service, values simplicity, and sets an example for his subordinates and the entire nation. If we were to follow the old customs, offering flattery and praise, it would not only violate the spirit of the new era but also greatly contradict the sincerity from the heart. Therefore, all flowery language is meaningless. Moreover, the national crisis today is urgent. Internally, the rebellious atmosphere has not been cleared, and externally, hidden worries lurk. Mr. Chiang, with his Shen Fu-like demeanor, bears the weight of the military and the nation. He toils faithfully for the country, from dawn till dusk. For ten years, our people have been able to live and work in peace, without being alarmed by violence. Tracing the source, all of this is a gift from Mr. Chiang. Now that his birthday is approaching, we respectfully follow the Yuan's order, instructing the whole country not to be extravagant. This further demonstrates his dedication to public service and selflessness. We should be even more motivated to repay him with our efforts. We, the colleagues, are deeply grateful for his kindness and recall his noble spirit. We believe that since Mr. Chiang has dedicated himself to the country, we should also seek ways to repay the country in order to repay Mr. Chiang. This is the best way to respond to his special concern and comply with public opinion. With the consensus of the public, we should take the lead in contributing. We have heard that when the German leader, Mr. Hitler, celebrated his birthday, the people of his country purchased aircraft to express their congratulations. This demonstrates love for the leader and also love for the country, and it has become a beautiful story spread throughout the world, praised as a grand event. How can our people lag behind? Purchasing aircraft to pay tribute is the unanimous opinion of the public. You, the leaders of all fields, are admired by the public. With your virtue of acting righteously, you have never been behind others. Please contribute your private funds to this great cause, which fulfills the meaning of repaying the country and expresses the sincerity of offering congratulations. We hope for your understanding and look forward to your clear instructions. We hereby make this special announcement. We wish you peace and tranquility.</p>

There is no reduction in the originally determined tariff rates. You should be informed."</p>
<p>Ministry Telegram: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the Banking and Money Industry Associations, four groups, previously telegraphed the government regarding smuggling in North China, requesting measures to prevent it and supporting the position of not reducing tariffs. The associations received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: "Your telegram has been read and noted.

<p>The Shanghai Electrical and Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association held a special emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday to prevent smuggling. Committee members Cai Shengbai, Wang Shiqiang, Tao Shaojiang, Jin Deqing, Gao Shiheng, Tong Xinbo, and Qian Boxi (Wang Shiqiang representing) attended. After Chairman Cai Shengbai reported on routine matters, Committee member Gao Shiheng proposed that, according to customs reports, the amount of rayon used by the silk weaving industry that is smuggled is extremely large, and there have recently been discoveries in Shanghai. A strict investigation should be carried out. Could the association submit a request to the government to stipulate that all rayon fabrics or interwoven fabrics produced by domestic silk weaving factories must be thoroughly investigated by the local silk weaving industry association to verify that smuggled rayon has not been used, and then issue a certificate before customs clearance and shipment? At the same time, the association should send personnel to each industry member in the city to conduct preliminary inspections to determine if smuggled rayon is being used, and issue certificates accordingly. Is this feasible? The meeting decided that the association should send letters to the Shanghai Silk and Rayon Industry Associations, urging them to pay close attention and convene a joint meeting of the three associations to discuss effective measures to inspect for smuggling.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Silk Mill Industry Association Cables Zhejiang Province to Release Detained Spring Cocoons <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the eighth executive meeting of the Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission decided that the price of raw silk should be 665 yuan, based on the average near and far term price in Yokohama and New York on the 15th, plus 10 yuan, combined with the cocoon recovery center price determined by reeling yield: improved seed cocoons, 280 catties dried and 450 catties reeled; 80 yuan for reeling labor; 26 yuan for cocoon collection expenses; the center price is set at 30 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) in the market. Local seed cocoons: 305 catties dried and 550 catties reeled; 100 yuan for reeling labor; 23 yuan for cocoon collection expenses; the center price is set at 21 yuan per dan in the market. The above center prices will be adjusted according to the silk price fluctuation based on reeling yield. Any significant increase or decrease in the silk price will be announced immediately and notified to the relevant authorities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for implementation. On May 15th, the near-term silk price in New York was $1.575 to $1.60 per pound, and the far-term silk price was $1.48 per pound. The current price in Japan was 705 Japanese yen per dan, and the far-term price was 689 Japanese yen per dan. The Zhejiang local seed cocoons started to be sold after May 20th, mostly stopping around May 30th. After the committee set the price on May 15th, the silk prices in New York and Yokohama gradually declined. On May 30th, the near-term price in New York was $1.44 and the far-term price was $1.39. The current price in Japan was 658 Japanese yen per dan, and the far-term price was 649 Japanese yen per dan. The silk price drop was almost a tenth of the value.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Proclamation</p>
<p>On May 26th, the Zhejiang Provincial Government issued a proclamation when the sale of local seed cocoons in Zhejiang Province was about to end: "Proclamation regarding the temporary measures for the control and management of cocoon collection during the spring period of the 25th year of the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee. The proclamation has been published and implemented by this government. During the cocoon collection period, if any cocoon trading houses or cocoon merchants engage in the following: 1. Opening a cocoon trading house without approval or registration; 2. Concealing or underreporting the amount of cocoons collected; 3. Collecting improved seed cocoons while only approved to collect local seed cocoons; 4. Reporting improved seed cocoons as local seed cocoons while approved to collect both local and improved seed cocoons; 5. Collecting both local and improved seed cocoons without approval to do so; 6. Failing to pay the fresh cocoon improvement fee and seed funds; 7. Smuggling cocoons out of the province without paying the fresh cocoon improvement fee and seed funds; 8. Failing to affix the fee payment certificate to the cocoon package when shipping dried cocoons, or affixing the fee payment certificate without an export permit; 9. Violating other regulations and disrupting the control and management policies, once verified, they will be punished with one or more of the following measures, depending on the severity of the circumstances: 1. Ordered to cease operations; 2. The cocoon trading house will be prohibited from re-establishing for three years; 3. The fees that should be paid will be doubled; 4. All dried cocoons will be confiscated, sold, and the proceeds will be used for rewards. Before the fresh cocoon improvement fee, seed funds, or fines are paid, a part or all of the collected spring cocoons will be detained. If necessary, they may be sold to offset the debt. In addition to instructing the county and municipal governments to instruct their subordinates, the cocoon collection offices in the region, to handle matters strictly and prevent fraud, this government is deeply concerned that our eyes and ears may not be sufficient. We hereby permit people in all areas to report to the cocoon collection offices in various districts, the county and municipal governments, and the public security bureaus. Those who are successful in reporting will be rewarded with half of the additional fees collected. The informant will receive 50%, the dried cocoon inspection office will receive 10%, the enforcement agency will receive 20%, and the military police handling the case will receive 20%. If the dried cocoon inspection office or the enforcement agency and the military police report the matter, the informant should also be given a reward, but they should not file false accusations based on personal grudges, lest they be punished instead. We hereby issue this proclamation to inform the public. Chairman Huang Zao Xiong; Silk Control Committee Chairman Zeng Yangfu."</p>
<p>Control Committee Approval</p>
<p>On May 27th, the Silk Mill Industry Association telegraphed Zhejiang Province: "To Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province and the Silk Control Committee of Hangzhou: The procedures for shipping Zhejiang cocoons are delayed, Shanghai factories need materials, and workers are waiting to reel. We earnestly request that you instruct the cocoon collection districts to expedite the approval of shipping procedures. This is for the public convenience. Sincerely, the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association." The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee replied: "Your telegram has been noted. If the cocoon merchants have paid all the fees they should pay, and the selling price of the local cocoons is above 21 yuan, they should be allowed to ship them quickly to benefit industry and commerce. In addition to instructing the district offices to comply, you are hereby informed. Committee Chairman Zeng Yangfu, May 29th, 25th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Association Cables Again</p>
<p>The Silk Mill Industry Association telegraphed the Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission again the night before last: "According to reports from members, some factories purchased cocoons in Zhejiang Province at a slightly lower price and are being detained from shipping. Shanghai factories need materials, silk workers are waiting to reel, and the situation is critical. We plead to explain the difficulties. We respectfully note that your committee decided that the spring cocoon center price should be based on the size of the reeling yield and the silk price, and any significant increase or decrease should be announced. At that time, the price was set based on the New York and Yokohama silk market prices on May 15th. However, since the Zhejiang cocoon market opened on May 20th, the silk price has plummeted, with a difference of about 10% from before. Although this is not a significant difference, Shanghai factories have to consider costs. Moreover, the reeling yield varies from place to place. The meaning of the term 'center' is that it should not be too far from the standard. Therefore, the selling price may be slightly lower, but it is not intentional to violate the standard. We earnestly request your committee to examine the changes in the silk market and the difficulties of the silk merchants. Please forward this to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Silk Control Committee to waive the punishment, release the detained goods, and do a good deed for both parties. Sincerely, the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association Committee." To the Silk Control Committee of Hangzhou: "According to reports from members, cocoons purchased in Zhejiang at a slightly lower price are being detained from shipping. Please explain the difficulties. We humbly believe that the National Economic Commission's Silk Improvement Committee stipulated the center price based on the silk price in the US and Japan and the reeling yield of fresh cocoons, and the cocoon price should fluctuate based on changes in the silk price and the reeling yield. However, since the cocoon market opened, the silk price has plummeted and the reeling yield varies from place to place. Silk merchants may have slightly lowered the selling price to protect their capital. This is not intentional to violate the standard. We humbly request you to be lenient, explain this to the provincial government, and instruct the districts to release the goods to relieve the difficulties. Sincerely, the Shanghai Silk Mill Industry Association."</p>

<p>The central government specially dispatched officials to Guangdong to pay respects to Hu Hanmin. In addition to Ye Chucang and Zhu Jiahua, both arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd aboard the French postal ship D'Artagnan. They changed to a night train to Nanjing that evening to report back. Sun Ke, Xu Chongzhi, Li Wenfan, and Chuan Bingchang are scheduled to return north on the Dollar Line's President Taft on the 4th, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 6th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Ju and Chu returned north on the French postal ship D'Artagnan and arrived in Shanghai at around 10 AM on the 2nd, docking at the China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan Wharf. Those who came to welcome them included Li Dachao, representing Mayor Wu; Wang Zhinan, representing Yang Hu, commander of the Songhu Garrison; Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner Liang ; Legislative Member Lin Baisheng; Liu Weiling, secretary of the Judicial Yuan; Tang Shi , secretary of the Municipal Government; Tang Zhaoshi, secretary of the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office; Yang Peng, president of the High Court Third Branch; Zhao Shibei, chief prosecutor; and Deng Keyu, chief clerk. After Ju and Chu disembarked, they went to the East Asia Hotel and their private residence on Avenue Albert to rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Chu's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Ju, he arrived in Guangdong on the 25th of this trip south. He paid respects to Chairman Hu on the same day. He went to Conghua on the 26th and left Guangdong for Hong Kong on the 27th. The trip was unusually brief. Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and others met him during the trip, but they never discussed national affairs. Chairman Hu's remains have been decided to be buried with state honors, but the burial site has yet to be determined. The rest of us went to Guangdong this time, but Mrs. Hu was ill with grief, so we did not meet her. Mrs. Hu intends to bury Chairman Hu's remains at Huanghuagang, but this is not an absolute intention and still needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Return to Nanjing That Evening</p>
<p>Ju and Chu took a night train back to Nanjing at 11 PM that evening to report everything to the central government. Yang Peng, president of the High Court Third Branch, hosted a banquet for Ju at the East Asia Restaurant on the afternoon of the 2nd.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Exchange Supervisor Discusses: Illegal Exchanges Will Not Be Realized; Exchange Law Stipulates That No Two Exchanges Can Exist in the Same Area <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that there have been long-standing rumors about a certain foreigner planning to set up an illegal exchange in this port. A Xin Xin Du reporter specifically visited the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor to inquire about their opinion. They replied as follows: There have been long-standing rumors about a certain foreigner planning to set up an illegal exchange in this port. A Xin Xin Du reporter specifically visited the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor to inquire about their opinion. They replied as follows: I have heard about the incident of a certain foreigner planning to set up an exchange for a long time, but in reality, it may not be realized. Because the Chinese Exchange Law stipulates that "for exchanges dealing in securities or the same type of goods, only one exchange may be established in each area." Therefore, no two exchanges can exist within the same Shanghai area. In the past, the gold, securities, and cotton yarn sections of the commodity exchange were ordered to merge one after another because they conflicted with the Exchange Law. Those who understand the general principles must take into account international ethics, and legitimate businessmen will never have such illegal organizations. Moreover, among commodity trading, the one with the closest relationship with a certain country in the market is cotton yarn. However, the cotton yarn industry of a certain country joined the Chinese Cotton Cloth Market for trading last year, so there is no need to establish another exchange separately. Even if a part of unscrupulous merchants take risks, the concession authorities will never allow them to violate Chinese law and set up another market for business within the concession. Moreover, how could Chinese merchants who have a basic understanding of the overall situation join such an illegal exchange as brokers or traders to disrupt the inherent trading market in China and be traitors, earning the scorn of others? Moreover, since this exchange is not a legal organization, it is not protected by law. Those who are attracted to it will not only suffer losses but also be subject to the sanctions of national law. Based on these reasons, it is speculated that it may not become a reality.</p>

<p>After the death of Chairman Hu Hanmin of the Central Standing Committee, there was mourning at home and abroad. In addition to the Central Government and local authorities sending representatives to Guangdong to pay respects, overseas Party branches, organizations, and groups also sent representatives back to China to pay respects. The US General Branch specially sent representatives Huang Zi and Huang Zicong back to China on an expedited trip. The two arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Dollar Line's President Hoover. Huang Guanyi and Huang Huapei, representing the Hu Hanmin Funeral Committee's Shanghai office, welcomed them at the ship. After Huang and others disembarked, they participated in a public memorial service at the funeral office in the afternoon and took the same ship to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong at 6:30 PM that evening.</p>

<p>The Chinese Farmers Bank was established to revitalize rural areas. After deliberation by the Legislative Yuan and the promulgation of regulations by the National Government, it was granted the right to issue banknotes. The bank was specially permitted to issue 100 million yuan of legal tender by order of the Ministry of Finance. It has successively handed over the required reserve fund to the Central Bank for safekeeping in accordance with the law, and followed the Ministry's order to use 50 million yuan to handle land and rural loans, focusing on the remote provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan, and regulating rural finance. The bank's banknotes are used in the same way as the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications.

<h3 id="e119">Lawyers Association: Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, Reception for All Circles Last Night <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association hosted guests from local newspapers, radio stations, entertainment circles, and theaters at the East Hall on the ninth floor of the YMCA at Baxianqiao in the French Concession at 7 pm last night. Those present included He Jia, Guan Jiu'an, Hu Zhengzhi, Liu Hang, Chen Dabei, Wang Wanbai, and dozens of others. Committee members present included Zhang Shijie, Zhu Yakui, Qian Jianqiu, Dong Chi, Zha Renwei, Cai Huan, Ma Shouhua, Xu Zuoliang, Zhu Fuju, Yu Chengxiu, Zhang Runmin, Mao Yun, Shen Yingshi, Zhang Juansheng, Wu Zhenghe, Feng Xizui, Qu Yue, Sun Zuji, Yang Minshi, Yu Zhongluo, Chen Zhichi, Jin Ximin, Wang Wei, etc., who were warmly received by Wu Xuepeng, Dai Jixian, etc. After taking their seats, Yu Chengxiu, Zhongluo, etc. briefly described the significance of urging the government to formulate a wrongful imprisonment compensation law as soon as possible, and requested all circles to expand publicity on the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Day on June 7, in order to achieve the goal of implementing the wrongful imprisonment compensation law as soon as possible. The guests and hosts enjoyed the evening. The "Main Points of Publicity for the Entertainment Industry in the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement of the Shanghai Lawyers Association" are recorded below: "Dear listeners, this program is entrusted by the Shanghai Lawyers Association to say a few words about the wrongful imprisonment compensation matter, which is beneficial to the public and which the government is eagerly expected to realize immediately. An ancient saying goes, 'When a woman of Qi suffers injustice, it does not rain for three years; when Zou Yan is imprisoned, snow falls in June.' These two sentences mean that if there is injustice in prison, even heaven and earth will be enraged. How can knowledgeable and spirited human beings stand by and watch without helping? What is the way to help? It is that the people demand that the government formulate a law on wrongful imprisonment compensation as soon as possible. The wrongful imprisonment compensation law stipulates that the judicial authorities, due to the exercise of their powers, unjustly imprison people, and they must bear the responsibility for compensation. To say it again, for officials serving in the judicial authorities, we want them to compensate for the spiritual or material losses of those who are unjustly imprisoned without cause. This system has been practiced for a long time in foreign countries. Since ancient times, our country has been extremely cautious in judging cases. There are 'those who indulge and deliberately enter people into crimes should bear joint responsibility,' (note: that is, officials who connive and deliberately implicate people in crimes should bear joint responsibility), and the Tang Dynasty had 'whipping for violating judgments,' (note: one of the five punishments, using bamboo to strike, commonly known as the small board). Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty 'gave money and rice needed for returning home to those who are innocent.' The classics are magnificent and easy to follow. The Republic of China has been established for twenty-five years. Everyone shouts slogans of respecting humanity and protecting human rights, but in reality, there are no provisions in the law for those who are unjustly imprisoned without cause to seek redress. Therefore, the Shanghai Lawyers Association holds a wrongful imprisonment compensation movement on a certain day in June every year. Why in June? Because June in the lunar calendar is around the Dragon Boat Festival, when families make zongzi to commemorate Qu Yuan, who was unjustly wronged and drowned himself in the river. It is hoped that the public will pay attention and unite to demand that the government quickly formulate a wrongful imprisonment compensation law, so as to avoid judicial officials from casually judging people to be sued and suffer losses. If we ordinary people unfortunately suffer unjust lawsuits and losses, with the wrongful imprisonment compensation law, we can also demand compensation from the state, etc."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Banking Association, in order to address the restriction of issuing delivery orders on the Longhai Railway, specially requested the Ministry of Railways for relief. The letter stated that the Longhai Railway does not issue delivery orders for any of the following three situations: 1. Any originating station or destination station without warehouse facilities; 2. Goods transported by combined water and land transport; 3. Delivery orders not requested by the merchant, resulting in the failure of delivery orders to be widely used on the railway, which is contrary to the original intention of promoting financial and transportation cooperation. Therefore, it is proposed that the freight receipts issued by each station that has not yet implemented delivery orders be approved to be treated as delivery orders. It is heard that the Ministry of Railways has transferred the matter to the Longhai Railway Administration for reply.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Instructions from the Ministry of Finance: Method of Affixing Stamps to Remittance Receipts Should Be Handled According to Silver Money Receipts <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance issued a directive to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the affixing of stamps to remittance receipts according to silver money receipts, stating: "Both Gengqing's telegrams have been received. Upon investigation, a remittance receipt is a receipt for receiving a remittance and is different in nature from a deposit receipt of a financial institution. According to the second item of the stamp tax rate table, silver money receipts, regardless of the amount, should be affixed with a two-cent stamp. Deposit receipts of financial institutions refer to the documents issued by financial institutions to depositors for withdrawing their deposits. A remittance receipt is a document established after receiving a certain amount of silver money remitted by a bank from a certain place. The former contains the nature of withdrawing silver money and should belong to the scope of withdrawing or remitting silver money in the fourth item of the tax rate. The latter contains the nature of receiving silver money and should belong to the scope of silver money and goods receipts in the second item of the tax rate table. In order to avoid misunderstandings by financial institutions, the words 'except for deposit receipts of financial institutions' are stated in the nature of the second item of the tax rate. Article 14 of the Implementing Rules of the Stamp Tax Law also clarifies the meaning of excluding deposit receipts of financial institutions. The provisions of the tax law are very clear. However, many banks in various places have printed the position for affixing stamps and the words 'two cents' on remittance receipts, which is based on the tax rate of the remittance receipt printed in the 'Questions on Affixing Stamps' compiled by the Banking Association. However, it is not known that the book was compiled by the Banking Practice Research Association affiliated to the association, and is intended for the study of banking colleagues and the general public. There are many errors in it and it is not sufficient to be used as a basis. How to affix stamps to vouchers used by the silver money industry should be based on the Stamp Tax Law. Since there are misunderstandings in various places, they should be corrected immediately. The Ministry has issued orders to the stamp tax bureaus of various provinces to instruct the banking associations of each province to notify all banks that remittance receipts should be affixed by the receiver according to the tax rate stipulated in the second item of the tax rate table. A one-cent stamp should be affixed for amounts of 3 yuan or more, a two-cent stamp for amounts of 10 yuan or more, and a three-cent stamp for amounts of 100 yuan or more. The receiver must not be required to affix a two-cent stamp regardless of the amount, and the words 'two cents' printed on the receipt should be deleted to comply with the tax law. As for the previous remittance receipts sent by banks for which the receiver should have affixed a three-cent stamp but only affixed a two-cent stamp, if it is verified that the words 'two cents' are indeed printed on the receipt, then the receiver's underpayment of the stamp tax is due to misunderstanding and should be leniently exempted from further investigation. Otherwise, the receiver should still be responsible. In addition to consulting the provincial and municipal governments to order the governments of each city and county to instruct the staff of the provincial stamp tax bureaus to inform them all, you should be informed of this batch."</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Cocoon Purchasing and Lending Syndicate Accommodates Manufacturers' Concerns about Cocoon Purchasing and Loans, a Total of 7.5 Million Yuan Has Been Released by Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Purchasing and Lending Syndicate for the 25th year is jointly organized by banks and money shops such as the Bank of Communications, with a total loan amount of 30 million yuan. The general office is located in Shanghai, and branch offices are located in Hangzhou and Wuxi. The loan application period in Zhejiang ended on the 20th of last month, and in Jiangsu, it ended on the 25th of last month. In order to implement the relief of rural areas and support industry and commerce, the syndicate has decided to handle the matter with accommodation through a committee meeting. As of yesterday, a total of about 7.5 million yuan has been released in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, silk merchants and manufacturers in various places in Jiangsu Province who purchase cocoons have been very enthusiastic in contacting the branch offices to apply, so the syndicate has decided to accommodate them, and the predetermined total amount may exceed 10 million yuan or more. In addition, the syndicate originally scheduled to hold regular committee meetings every Wednesday, but now it has decided to suspend them, and the standing committee members will convene meetings at any time as needed.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Various Industries Agree to Reform the Accounting Year-End Opinions <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, yesterday, the government intended to change the accounting year to a calendar year system, and then transferred the opinions of various industries to Mr. Wei Tingsheng of the Legislative Yuan. The letter stated that it had received your letter inquiring whether it would be inconvenient for merchants and people if the government's accounting year was changed to a calendar year system. On May 23, we first answered with a summary of our association's opinions, and later received replies from the restaurant industry, insurance industry, egg industry, cotton trading industry, etc., and forwarded them on May 29. Now we have received letters from Hua soap industry, pawn industry, and inland river shipping industry, stating that the government's use of the calendar year system as the accounting year is not inconvenient for merchants and people. The medicine industry also stated that the government's current accounting year is rarely used in commerce except for banks, and still follows the commercial customs of receiving and resolving to conclude. This situation has been understood by the government, so whether the government's accounting year is changed or not in the future is not of much importance, etc. The meaning is the same as the association's reply on May 23. This is the general situation of the commercial industry in the city. Now, because the ten-day deadline set in your letter has expired, the intentions of the various industries that replied later are the same as the various letters now, and there is no discrepancy, so they will no longer be forwarded to avoid redundancy and are combined for statement.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The National Federation of Commerce Emailed the Ministry of Finance Requesting to Stop Affixing Stamps to Purchase Drafts, the Jiangxi Stamp Tax Bureau Misunderstood the Department's Regulations, Requesting to Issue a Notice to Stop Disputes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Federation of Commerce emailed the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Recently, the Jiujiang Chamber of Commerce sent a letter stating that many cases of forcing the affixing of stamps to foreign purchase drafts have been discovered in Jiujiang this year, causing extreme disturbance. The reason for the mandatory affixing of stamps is that this bill is a bill for withdrawing goods and should be handled according to the fifth item in the tax rate table, which is an over-misunderstanding. Bills for withdrawing goods are for paying goods by voucher, without any increase or decrease, and have a definite value as proof, so stamps should be affixed. This purchase order, for the party issuing the order, some are dedicated to stores with whom they have dealings, and some are not related to any specific store. Regardless of the number of goods opened on the order, and the amount of silver dollars attached, it is only to let the other party know the number of goods needed for details. After the other party receives the order, whether the goods are complete and the price is as required, those who have dealings must register and account according to their actual situation, and those who have no dealings must issue an invoice according to their actual situation and hand it over to the purchaser as proof. The purchaser's original draft has no effect of withdrawing goods and is absolutely insufficient to be given importance. The nature should be clarified and the Ministry of Finance should be asked to order the bureau to cancel this stamp affixing, etc. Upon investigation, the nature of the shipping invoice in the first item and the bill for withdrawing goods in the fifth item in the stamp tax law tax rate table are very clear and should not be stretched. It is said that if all purchase drafts are required to be affixed with stamps, then the store receiving the order must go through the shipping procedures again after receiving the order, regardless of whether the goods and prices opened on the order are exactly the same. This is stamping twice for one item at one time. Considering the legislative intent and the names of the tax rates, in addition to directly submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance, asking for an order to the Jiangxi Stamp and Tobacco Tax Office to cancel this stamp affixing, the corresponding letter is sent to your association, asking you to investigate and forward it to the Ministry of Finance for vigorous struggle to achieve the goal of cancellation, etc. According to this reason, it is appropriate to email to your department for review, and ask for permission to issue a notice to stop the universal exemption of purchase drafts from stamp affixing, to avoid disputes. Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce of the Republic of China, Lin Kanghou."</p>

<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Society at 505 Henan Road is a long-standing charitable organization in China, dedicated to construction and disaster relief. The projects it has undertaken, such as road construction, dike repair, canal excavation, farming and rural cooperation throughout the country, and emergency relief, are very brave, such as cloth distribution, clothing distribution, medical treatment, and medicine distribution, and the establishment of disaster relief shelters and literacy classes. The results are very good. For fifteen years, it has been praised by the society and rewarded by the government.

<p>Yesterday morning, around 5 AM, a tragic bloodbath occurred at No.  of Tonghe Lane, 218 Foch Road, in the Public Concession. The deceased was Jiao Guisun, the second landlord of the house, and his wife, Mrs. Jiao, was also severely wounded. The perpetrator of this crime was Zhang Junmou (30 years old), a Chinese constable with badge number 2650 from the Huishan Police Station, originally from Anhui Province. However, during the incident, Zhang Junmou was also shot and wounded by Chinese constables from both the British and French concessions. In addition to sending Zhang Junmou to the police hospital for treatment, Ms. Wu Chen (25 years old), the protagonist in this scandalous tragedy, was also detained and taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station for investigation. Subsequently, at 2:30 PM, Chinese detective Yao Changmin and Western detective Lei Tuo were specially assigned to escort Ms. Wu Dong to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special District Court, requesting her detention. The</p>
<p>Trial Proceedings are recorded in detail below. First, the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, gave a detailed account of the incident, stating that Wu Yujing, a man from Anhui Province, currently 43 years old, works as a driver of vehicle No. 214 at the Foch Road branch of the Xiang Sheng Motor Company. He married Wu Chen, a woman from the same province, over ten years ago, and they resided on the third-floor mezzanine of Jiao Changgui's house at No. 3 Tonghe Lane, Foch Road, raising four daughters. The eldest is ten years old, and the youngest is only eight months old and still in swaddling clothes. The first defendant, Zhang Junmou, has been a Chinese constable with badge number 2650 at the Huishan Police Station for ten years. Because he and the Wu couple were from the same province and had known each other for a long time, they had frequent interactions. Later, Zhang discovered that Wu Chen felt her husband and Yujing were old, and she deeply</p>
<p>regretted her beauty being wasted on an old man. Therefore, he seized the opportunity to make advances. Soon, he achieved his goal, and their affair had become frequent. On the 27th of last month, Wu Yujing returned home from the company, only to find his wife and Zhang Junmou whispering sweet nothings in the living room, behaving intimately. Zhang immediately left when he saw Wu. Since then, Zhang, fearing that his affair had been exposed by Wu, discussed running away with Wu Chen. The next day, the 28th, she packed up valuables worth 110 yuan and fled. Wu Yujing then reported the situation to the Chengdu Road Police Station, stating that his wife had run away with Zhang Junmou. After receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives to the Huishan Police Station to inquire about Zhang, but since there was no corroborating evidence, they took</p>
<p>no action at the time. Until about 5 AM this morning, Chinese constable Zhang Junmou, badge number 2650, was supposed to be on night duty on Huishan Road as usual. Unexpectedly, after only one hour on duty, he went to Room 26 of the Tiande Inn on Dalian Bay Road. After meeting with Wu Chen, he took off his uniform, changed into plain clothes, and, carrying a Shanghai Municipal Council pistol No. 1487, went with her to No. 3 Tonghe Lane, Foch Road. He knocked on the door and entered the house, announcing to Wu Yujing, "I have no personal animosity towards you, but please ask Jiao Changgui to come downstairs." Since Jiao refused to come downstairs, Zhang went upstairs and fired four shots, severely wounding the Jiao couple. Zhang immediately</p>
<p>took the gun and went downstairs, attempting to flee. He was shot eight times by Chinese constables No. 127, No. 914, No. 885 from the Chengdu Road Police Station, and No. 658 from the French Police Station, wounding his left shoulder and causing him to fall to the ground. At that time, Wu Chen, seeing Zhang injured, immediately went forward and cried bitterly. She was then arrested. Telegrams were sent to the police station, and detectives were dispatched to send the injured to the hospital for treatment. However, Jiao Changgui soon died. Mrs. Jiao's injuries are severe, and her life is in danger. Therefore, we request that Wu Chen be detained, etc." When questioned, Wu Chen confessed to having an affair with Zhang Junmou for only one month. On the 28th of last month, I ran away from home and spent the night with Zhang at the Shihua Hotel. The next day, we moved to the Tianqing Hotel. Last night, Zhang returned to the hotel, saying that the</p>
<p>secret had been exposed, that your husband had reported it to the police, and that Jiao "Ma Pí" (i.e., Changgui) from the front building had testified. It would be better to send you back, but Jiao should not ruin my good deeds. In the future, we must find a way to kill him. We discussed it all night, and at 5 AM this morning, Zhang hired a Gonghe car and accompanied me to Tonghe Lane. I only went to the downstairs of No. 3, but Zhang had already acted upstairs, etc." Wu Yujing also stated in his report that he was 43 years old, from Anhui Province, and worked as a driver for the Xiang Sheng Motor Company. He lived with his wife, Chen, on the second-floor mezzanine of No. 3 Tonghe Lane. On the 28th of last month, my wife ran away, and according to Jiao Changgui, it was related to Zhang Junmou. So, on the 31st, I reported it to the police. This morning, around 4 AM, Zhang and Wu Chen</p>
<p>arrived and called at the door. After my friend, surnamed Ma, opened the door, Zhang and others demanded the evidence that I had reported them for adultery. Seeing their aggressive manner, I fled to a nearby company. Unexpectedly, Zhang and others followed and entangled with me. Unable to do anything, I took the opportunity to drive an empty car to the police station to report. By the time I returned home with the detectives, the tragedy had already occurred, etc." Jiao Changgui's ten-year-old son, Dingqiao, also testified that he saw Zhang at the door, first shooting his mother twice, causing her to fall to the ground, and then shooting his father twice, killing him. At that time, Wu Chen was standing behind Zhang, and after the shooting, Zhang was dragged away, etc. Judge Huang Risheng, after reviewing the testimony, ordered Wu Chen to be detained until next Tuesday for further questioning. The prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court also scheduled an autopsy for today.</p>

<p>The "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reports that, according to news this morning, the international exhibition, which had been widely discussed for the past three months, seems to be in danger of being abandoned due to difficulties in raising funds. The entire plan may fail. Although one-third of the buildings at the Yangshupu venue have been completed, work has now been suspended. The staff at the Jing'an Temple Road office have also stopped working. If it is indeed abandoned, the guarantee money deposited by factories and stores that have registered to participate in the exhibition will be refunded.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Mr. Qiu Chunshan, Owner of the Chunhua Silk Braid Factory in the Nanshi District, Assassinated. <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Three Assailants Inflict Multiple Ax Wounds, Leaving Him in Critical Condition; Leaflets Found Afterward Offer Potential Clues.</p>
<p>Qiu Chunshan, 43, from Zhenjiang, resides at No. 9, Jiande Lane, Scissors Bridge, Meixie Road, Nanshi. He has been running the Chunhua Silk Braid Factory at the Huining Road intersection for over ten years, and the business is quite prosperous. He is known for being amiable and capable and also serves as the chairman of the Nanshi Rickshaw Industry Association. He is married to Mrs. Cao, 40, and they have three sons and three daughters, enjoying a comfortable life and family happiness. Recently, Qiu purchased land</p>
<p>to build a new five-room house at the Lingjia Residence on Meixie Road, which will be completed soon. He planned to move the Chunhua Silk Braid Factory there. Yesterday morning at 7 AM, Qiu left his home and went to the Lingjia Residence to inspect the new house. At 8:30 AM, as he was about to return home for breakfast, he was ambushed by three assailants while passing through the wasteland west of Chezhan Road, near the Jiangbei Great World. One of the assailants was tall and burly, wearing a blue cloth long gown, while the other two were wearing blue cloth short jackets. They blocked his path, and each of them drew a sharp ax, attacking Qiu fiercely. He was struck in the left leg, suffering a severe ax wound, and also received five ax wounds to his right arm, front, and back chest. He collapsed in a pool of blood, barely breathing. Upon hearing the news, officers from the Liyuan Road and Chezhan Road police stations rushed to the scene, but the assailants had already fled. He was immediately sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and admitted to Ward 22.</p>
<p>Due to excessive blood loss, his life is in critical condition. Subsequently, Yao Guangnai, the chief of the Ximen Branch Bureau, ordered detective Yao Renjie to go to the scene of the attack to investigate the incident. Two printed leaflets related to the case were found nearby. The titles were "China Industrial and Commercial Patriotic Youth Association" and "Shanghai Comrades Organization Secret Investigation Squad," etc. Therefore, the truth behind the attack may be related to these organizations. The police station is now working hard to investigate and strictly apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice. After Qiu Chunshan arrived at the hospital, he underwent surgery and bandaging. As of 8 PM last night, he was still conscious. If his condition does not change, his life can be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Frequent Public Bus Accidents; Judge Advocates for Caution <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Gu Yongxiang's Corpse Examined Yesterday; Driver Under Investigation by Police</p>
<p>Gu Yongxiang, a 15-year-old student from a certain middle school, residing at No. 18 Shanxi Road, along with three classmates, were riding bicycles out of Yongning Lane on Henan Road around 9 AM the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, Shi Zhenggao, the driver of public bus No. 15037 on Route 5, was also driving south on the same road. Unable to avoid a collision, the front right wheel of the bus knocked Gu over, and both the person and the bicycle were run over by the wheel, causing Gu severe injuries. After the police arrived, they urgently summoned an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. Upon receiving the report, the chief patrol officer ordered detective Yang Zaishan and others to investigate the scene. The body was then transported to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. First, the Western police chief reported the situation, stating that the deceased was riding his bicycle out of Yongning Lane and intended to turn south. He should have made a small turn, but at that time, a rickshaw was parked at the entrance of the lane. To pass the rickshaw, he made a large turn. A rickshaw was also on the opposite side of the road, causing the public bus to hit him, etc. Gu Kaishi, 55, a cook, also stated that the deceased was his son and that he was killed in the accident, requesting justice. Prosecutor Zhang stated that there were many public bus accidents in Shanghai and instructed the Western police chief that someone from the court witnessed the public bus swerving too far to the right at the time of the accident, and that the perpetrators must be warned in the future. He then announced that the examination confirmed that the deceased, student Gu Yongxiang, male, was indeed knocked down and run over by public bus No. 15037 on Route 9, resulting in his death. The body was handed over to the deceased's father, Gu Kaishi, for burial after signing a bond. The bus driver, Shi Zhenggao, was at fault for swerving to the right while driving and should be investigated by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Origin of the Box Cannon Under the Coffin <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Originally Hidden by a Robbery Gang; The Thief Has Reformed and Turned to Good.</p>
<p>The Zhabei Xinzha Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau received a tip-off at the end of last month that a box cannon and other items were hidden under a coffin somewhere in Tanzi Bay. The branch chief, Liao Jiongran, immediately dispatched the on-duty police chief, Zhu Jiapu, along with detectives Zang Nai, Zhang Shuwen, Lü Qingkang, and Yang Yucai, to investigate. They found a box cannon wrapped in a black raincoat and 26 bullets under a coffin on a barren tomb. The number on the gun was 741001. After bringing it back to the bureau, Branch Chief Liao believed that the report was not without connection, so he immediately ordered the report to be investigated and verified. It has been learned that the box cannon was owned by Huang Tie, a robber who committed a crime in the Public Concession and was sentenced to eight years in prison. While serving his sentence in the Huade Road Prison, he met Sun Dejin (also a thief). In January of this year, Huang was released on parole after serving only three years. Later, Sun was also paroled and bailed out by someone. Recently, Sun suddenly encountered Huang on the road. Upon seeing each other, they were very friendly because they were fellow inmates and invited Huang to Sun's home in a thatched shed in Tanzi Bay for a chat before parting. The next evening around 9 PM, Huang brought a box cannon and 26 bullets to Sun's house for temporary storage. Sun, having already reformed and turned to good, refused to accept them. However, Huang insisted on temporarily placing them there, and there was a slight conflict in their words. Later, Sun feared that something unfavorable might happen to him, so he took the box cannon and bullets and told Huang to come and take them the next day. Unexpectedly, Huang did not come to retrieve them the next day, so Sun Dejin hid the box cannon under a coffin behind the land temple next to the nearby cattle bone factory and secretly reported it to the Xinzha Branch Bureau to be retrieved. It is now known that Branch Chief Liao believes that since the criminal committed a crime in the Public Concession and was released on parole, there must have been a guarantee. Who is the guarantor? It is not difficult to investigate. If the criminals can repent and surrender, turn to good, they can be forgiven for the past.</p>

<p>Investigating Shen Jinzhi's Age; Was There Coercion Involved if Love Letters Led to Seduction?</p>
<p>Shen Jinzhi, the young owner of the Shen Wanyu lamp wick and rush mat shop at No. 327 Yongyou Lane, Damatou Road, Nanshi, enjoys the blessings of his ancestors and is wealthy. He spends his nights in brothels and is a handsome young man, a "小白臉" (pretty boy) of Shanghai. Therefore, he is well-liked by prostitutes. Several years ago, he became close to Wang Fengzhen, a Yunnan style courtesan in the area between Guangxi Road and Shantou Road. They extinguished the candles and left their hair unbound, and made vows with bitten arms, eventually agreeing to marry each other and even taking a photo together at Tiger Hill in Suzhou. Since Shen was unmarried at home, the two planned to become a legal couple. However, Shen's family strongly opposed it, so they once drew up an agreement to separate. However, in the winter of last year, their old love revived, and the two drew up a contract themselves, stating that if the man abandoned the woman, he would have to compensate her 8,000 yuan. If the woman left the man, she would have to compensate him 5,000 yuan. However, due to family pressure and the shifting of money, Shen Jinzhi, on April 19 of this year, followed his parents' wishes and held a wedding with Xia Hefang, a wealthy woman, at the Lake Society Auditorium. Wang Fengzhen, seeing that her lover had become a stranger, took the contract to the Shanghai District Court, requesting a judgment ordering the payment of 8,000 yuan in compensation according to the contract. The lawsuit stated that Shen Jinzhi was currently 22 years old, and Wang Fengzhen was also 22 years old. This case continued to be heard yesterday. Shen Jinzhi raised the issue of age, stating that he was only 21 years old at the time and that he had not yet celebrated his birthday when the contract was made, meaning that he was still under 20 years old, and therefore had no capacity to act under the law. He also claimed that the contract was made at the Daya Restaurant, where he was made drunk and taken to the China Hotel, where he was forced to write it by more than ten men and women, and that it was not of his own free will. However, Wang Fengzhen said that Shen was a college student and was actually 22 years old, and that there were love letters seducing her before the contract was made, so how could there be coercion? The court ordered that the age be clarified before further hearing.</p>

<p>Court Summons Plaintiff for Questioning Yesterday; Jing Youmei Provides Details of the Seduction</p>
<p>Lin Tianji, the deputy director of the Audit Office of the Central Bank, from Guangdong, was recently accused by Jing Kekong, the father of Jing Youmei (21 years old, originally from Nanjing, moved to Wuxing), a woman from Wuxing who previously studied at Peiming Girls' High School on Magen Road, of seducing and abandoning his daughter. He requested that he be punished according to Articles 240, Paragraph 1, and 294, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. After receiving the lawsuit, the court believed that the facts listed in the plaintiff's lawsuit were unclear, so Judge Xiao Bianfen opened the Criminal Division 3 at 2 PM yesterday, and summoned only the plaintiff, Jing Kekong, and the person concerned, Jing Youmei, to be questioned. The defendant, Lin Tianji, was not notified. Jing Kekong stated that he lived at No. 412 Jingjiang Road and worked as a staff member in the Ganyu County government. My daughter was born at the hour of Xu on September 12-13 of the Republic of China Year 4, the year of the Dragon. Although she is nominally 21 years old, she is actually not yet 20 years old. As for the facts of the seduction, you must ask my daughter, etc. The court then summoned Jing Youmei to the case. According to her testimony, in August of the Republic of China Year 22, I came to Shanghai with my mother and lived at No. 5 Pingqiao Lane, Aivenyi Road. I went to Peiming Girls' High School to register for admission. I met my friend, Shen Xifan, at the registration office and went to Sincere Company with her to shop. I met Lin at the company. Through Shen's introduction, I became acquainted with Lin. Lin invited me to the East Asia Hotel and treated me to dinner. I lost my virginity there. At that time, Lin said that he had no wife. From then on, he rented No. 20 Ruikang Lane, Beijing Road, and we lived together. I told my mother that I could not stay at home because I was busy with schoolwork and traveling for sightseeing, in order to deceive her. Later, we moved to Anning Lane, Hercux Road. In January of Year 23, my mother found out because I was pregnant. Lin said that he would marry me after I gave birth, so my mother did not negotiate with him. I then gave birth to a son, who is now three years old. On July 1 of last year, we moved to No. 83 Baoshan Lane. I currently live there. At first, Lin gave me 150 yuan per month for living expenses, but in February of this year, it was reduced to 100 yuan, and last month it was reduced to 70 yuan. Now he has stopped coming altogether, and I have learned that he already has a wife. My father has also found out, so I filed a lawsuit. Judge Xiao asked in great detail about the location, time, and details of the cohabitation, and then ordered them to withdraw and await verification.</p>

<p>Although Faces Are Similar, Child Claims Surname Is Yan, Not Guo.</p>
<p>Grandma Yan Ding, from Suzhou, lives at No. 53 Lin Yin Branch Road. She had a son named Gengquan, who has passed away, leaving behind a seven-year-old grandson, Guanqing. In June of the year before last, he was abducted by bandits. At the same time, Haiji, the four-year-old son of Guo Jinling from Beiping, was also abducted. Despite searching everywhere, there was no trace of them. It was not until September of last year that the Ruian Public Security Bureau in Zhejiang Province cracked an abduction case. They learned that the abducted child lived in Shanghai, so they photographed the child and sent it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, requesting that the family be contacted to identify him. Guo Jinling learned of this and went to identify him. He saw that the abducted child's face was similar to that of his lost four-year-old Haiji and was overjoyed. He rushed to Ruian overnight and took the child Guanqing back as Haiji. Unexpectedly, at the end of the year, a child living next door to Yan Ding's family passed by the Guandi Temple on Zhaojiabang Road and suddenly saw Guanqing, who had been missing for more than a year. He immediately ran to tell Yan Ding and embraced him as if he had found a rare treasure. He was about to ask him what had happened when Guo Jinling heard the news and rushed out, accusing Yan Ding of falsely claiming the lost child. He called the police, and they were both taken to the bureau and transferred to the District Court, where they were interrogated by Prosecutor Tang. Guo claimed that Guanqing was his abducted son, while the old woman claimed that he was her grandson, clearly showing that Guo had deliberately mistaken the child and taken him away. After the prosecutor's interrogation, and after listening to the child's statement and accent, it was proven that he was Yan Ding's grandson, and that Guo's lost child was four years old, while this child was seven years old. Therefore, Guanqing was given to Yan Ding to take care of. However, due to the strange appearance of the child, which was similar to that of Guo Jinling, he relied on the issue of appearance and filed a lawsuit in the civil court, demanding confirmation that Guanqing was his biological son Haiji. Yesterday, Judge Han Jingdou summoned him for questioning, and also summoned the neighbor cited by Yan Ding as a witness, and the child Guanqing was also brought to court. He also stated that he was not Guo's son, but Yan Ding's grandson, and that his name was Guanqing, not Haiji. The judge then announced the end of the interrogation and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>

<p>(Twenty-seventh Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>1.  Evolution and Scope of the Hardware Industry</p>
<p>The history of Shanghai's hardware industry has no definite record. Except for the copper and tinware production, which began during the Tongzhi period, the so-called hardware industry has only about sixty years of history to date. According to reports, it started as peddling, and after Mr. Ye Chengzhong opened the Lao Shunfei Hardware Store (also known as food hardware at the time), Shanghai gradually had the name of the hardware industry. Subsequently, due to the progress of the world's mining and metallurgical industries, there were many products, and the patterns were also updated daily. Therefore, the scope of the hardware industry gradually expanded. Until today, everything from construction raw materials to doors, windows, and trivial utensils is included. The business is becoming increasingly complex, so the industry is divided according to the types of goods.</p>
<p>Commonly known as hardware includes gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin. Except for gold and silver, which are mainly used as currency and jewelry and have been separated and independently operated, the remaining copper, iron, and tin are very useful in industry. Machines, guns, bullets, building materials, and household utensils all depend on these. There are also lead, antimony, zinc, and nickel, which are listed outside of hardware, but their usefulness is not less than copper, iron, and tin, so they are usually included in the hardware industry. In terms of the size of the business scope, the industry can be divided into the following types: 1. Iron industry - selling steel bars, plates, and raw and cooked iron blocks for construction purposes.</p>
<p>2. Large hardware industry - selling construction metal materials, such as galvanized iron sheets, tinplate, steel bars, etc.</p>
<p>3. Small hardware industry - buying and selling metal products for roads, mines, factories, and daily odds and ends, such as knives, pins, springs, hinges, etc.</p>
<p>4. Copper and tin industry - specializing in hardware mineral raw materials, such as copper, tin, lead, antimony, nickel, zinc, and manufacturing and selling copper and tin household utensils.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four types, there are also those who manufacture machines and sell hardware parts, which are called machine hardware industry. Those who mainly deal in glass and attach small hardware are called glass hardware industry. Those who manufacture hardware accessories used on vehicles are called vehicle hardware industry. Those who undertake water and electricity projects and sell metal products such as water pipes and faucets are called electrical hardware industry. Those who buy and sell glassware and sell household cooking metal utensils are called food hardware industry. Those who sell architectural decorations such as carpets, painted cloths, oil felt bathtubs, etc. and hardware parts are called miscellaneous hardware industry. Those who buy and sell used hardware products are called used hardware industry. Taken together, it can be seen that the scope of the hardware industry is vast. However, the hardware industry in Shanghai refers to the iron industry, large hardware, small hardware, and steel and tin industries. In addition to the operation and sale of metal products, it is not a purely hardware industry (to be continued).</p>

<h3 id="e157">Eliminating the Scourge of Opium and Transforming Life <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>—Transcribed from a Speech During the Expanded Propaganda Week for Opium Prohibition and Drug Rejection—</p>
<p>Grand Preceptor Pulin said: "The poison of opium is more severe than floods and wild beasts. There is no one in the world who can say that opium should not be prohibited... If this disaster is not eliminated, in ten years, not only will there be no usable soldiers, but there will also be no funds to support them." The spread of opium in the mainland is like the spread of a boil on the body: today, the scourge of opium has spread, and it will not only be ten years, but perhaps a hundred years. The severity of the opium scourge is undoubtedly well known to everyone; even those who are addicted to opium deeply hate it. Why is it that for a hundred years, the more opium is prohibited, the more rampant the scourge becomes; even promising young people cannot prevent the invasion of opium? This is due to the incomplete, incomplete, and severe prohibition methods in the past. However, examining the most fundamental cause, it is due to the irrationality of the general national life. Wealthy families, idle crowds, do not engage in proper work or production; their lives are romantic and undisciplined, with no rules. Eating, living, and sleeping are irregular, and they are addicted to the pleasures of sensual gratification, indulging day and night, consuming and exhausting themselves, resulting in insufficient spirit and daily loss of energy. Therefore, they drink poison to quench their thirst, become addicted to opium, and cannot free themselves. Therefore, to eliminate the scourge of opium, on the one hand, we should seek thorough methods and strict laws; on the other hand, we should engage in the transformation of national life; so that the national life becomes more rational, and the people of the country are strong and vigorous; and no longer feel the need for opium. This is the fundamental way to eliminate the scourge of opium, and it is up to the active promotion of the New Life Movement!</p>
<h3 id="e158">The June 3rd Memorial and Lin Zexu <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Liang</p>
<p>With foreign troubles increasing daily and national crises unresolved, on this June 3rd Memorial, we remember the sage Lin Zexu. Reflecting on the past, can our hearts not be filled with pain? Lin Zexu's far-sightedness and deep understanding of matters were unmatched in his time. When discussing the harm of opium, he said: "It is more severe than floods and wild beasts. Even Yao and Shun in today's world could not but eliminate it. The sage enforces the law to punish good, which is for the sake of the world for all generations, and no one in the world can say that opium should not be prohibited." "If this disaster is not eliminated, in ten years there will be no soldiers to use and no funds to raise." The spread of opium in the mainland is like the spread of ulcers on the body. When ulcers grow, they gradually become pus; when opium comes, it gradually leads to invaders..." As for the method of prohibiting opium, he advocated cutting off the source externally, requiring foreign merchants to sign a guarantee: "If opium is found to be carried in the future, the goods will be confiscated and the person will be executed." Internally, following Huang Weizi, he first advocated the use of strict laws and severe punishments: "The pain of quitting addiction is worse than cangues and imprisonment. The offender knows this and refuses to quit. If he is sentenced to death, the urgency of the execution is more painful than the prolongation of addiction..." As for the abstinence of addicts, he used the five-family mutual responsibility system for the people and the five-person mutual guarantee regulations for the soldiers. He first showed compassion, then threatened with punishment, explained the dangers, and encouraged with benefits, so that the people knew what to be vigilant about. In his explanation, there were awakened and painful words such as: "Wealth is the source of nourishing life, and silver is not easy to come by. To exchange silver for mud is ridiculous, and to give up silver to take poison is sad..." We can see that his observation was insightful, his arguments were just, his methods were meticulous, and his hatred was deep. Therefore, after being ordered to Guangzhou, vendors and addicts temporarily disappeared. He then forced British merchants to surrender more than 20,000 boxes of opium, which were burned on June 3, 1839. Because the Fushang merchants were aggressive, privately贩运, and did not submit, and even killed our people and refused to hand over the murderers, they borrowed the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to cause the so-called Opium War, ceding land and paying indemnities, opening five ports for trade, and establishing the Treaty of Nanjing, which opened the precedent for concluding unequal treaties and causing endless troubles to the country. Before that, when the British ships opened fire on Guangdong, Lin Gong resisted the enemy and did not succeed; The border officials of the provinces, because of the long period of peace, were complacent, neglected to defend, did not understand the great righteousness, did not know how to unite, and gave way to treacherous people who loved profit and acted as accomplices, so the British army captured Dinghai, Zhejiang, leading to failure. As a result, Lin Gong was exiled, and the opium prohibition failed. He carried his ambition to the end! On this June 3rd Opium Prohibition Memorial Day, we remember the past and feel deeply saddened. Therefore, we introduce a brief history of Lin Gong to the people of the country, so that they can learn from his example and use it as a thought for reflection.</p>
<p>Early Years - His Life</p>
<p>Gong was born smart and quick. His body was short and his voice was loud. He married Zheng. His family had been scholars, but by the time of Gong, the family was in decline and food was often insufficient. He entered the village school at the age of four and never forgot what he read. He was recommended to the township at the age of twenty. Governor Zhang Shuicheng was surprised by him and invited him to be a guest, where he learned the essentials of criminal law and politics. At the age of twenty-seven, he became a jinshi and was appointed as an editor. He devoted himself to the study of statecraft and served as the examiner of Jiangxi and Yunnan. He was able to strictly eliminate the bad habits of the examination halls and earnestly select talents, and the atmosphere changed accordingly.</p>
<p>Middle Age - Promoting Water Conservancy, Dike Construction, Rectifying Money and Grain, and Cleaning up Officialdom</p>
<p>At the age of thirty-six, he was appointed as a supervising censor, and from then on, he began his political life. He considered everything related to national economy and people's livelihood. In particular, he was fair in judging cases, and the people praised him as "Lin Qingtian". His reputation for integrity was well-known. When he was summoned to the capital, Emperor Xuanzong praised him in person, saying, "Your reputation in Zhejiang is very good." From this, it can be seen that Gong was an upright official. In the third year of Daoguang, he was promoted to surveillance commissioner. At that time, Jiangsu suffered from floods, and the fields were devastated. Gong's father proposed various policies to relieve the famine, such as encouraging the county to distribute relief supplies, raising cattle for plowing, and burying the starving. Gong decided to implement them, and the people of Jiangsu congratulated him. He then became acting provincial administration commissioner, and his reputation was even greater. Before four years, Gong's parents passed away one after another. He was saddened and returned home. When he was out of office, he enjoyed the leisure of being at home. After serving his term of mourning, he repeatedly served as a provincial administration commissioner, governor-general, governor and other high-ranking officials, and vigorously eliminated the accumulated abuses of river works, reduced redundant personnel, exempted money and grain, rectified grain transportation, and consoled refugees. His achievements in benefiting the people were indeed not trivial. Emperor Xuanzong praised him, and he was transferred to five new positions in one year, which shows the emperor's favor.</p>
<p>Old Age - Handling Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>During the Daoguang Dynasty, foreign merchants shipped more than 30,000 boxes of opium to China every year, causing gold and silver to flow out and the people to become impoverished. The court officials advocated prohibiting opium to plug the leak and enrich the national treasury. Gong was based on his daily observations of the opium scourge and proposed six opium prohibition measures, and strongly advocated the death penalty. Because the opium scourge has reached its extreme, it cannot be prevented by ordinary methods. He also said, "It is not difficult to reform opium, but it is difficult to reform the heart. Therefore, if you want to reform the heart of playing with the law, how can you not establish a law of fear to make smokers wary and abstain themselves." After this memorial was submitted, he was ordered to Guangzhou for inspection and prohibition. On his way to office, Gong investigated the treacherous people who packaged, sold, transported, and escorted opium, and issued a notice to the Guangdong authorities to arrest them. As soon as he got off the bus, the old Yi merchant Chadun also fled back to his country first, and the bulk ships transporting opium were about to move away. Seeing this, Gong ordered the Yi merchants to quickly surrender the opium. The British leader and merchants were forced to agree to surrender, totaling more than 20,000 boxes, and ordered the British to issue a letter of guarantee that they would not transport opium again before they could complete the matter. On the one hand, he vigorously reorganized the military, trained strong men and repaired gun emplacements. He then received a court edict ordering the confiscation of opium to be destroyed on the spot. It was burned at Humen on June 3, 1839, and lasted for more than twenty days. Just then, an incident occurred in which a British man killed a Chinese man, and he refused to hand over the murderer. He then ordered the expulsion of the British from Macau and cut off firewood and food. The British leader was unwilling and fired at Kowloon to demonstrate. In view of this fierce situation, Gong flew to the capital. The Qing court then issued an edict formally suspending trade with British merchants and closing the port. The British were hit hard. When the British Parliament decided to send a fleet to China, it first attacked Guangdong and Fujian, and Gong planned to punish them severely. However, at that time, the people of the country were accustomed to comfort, and public opinion was boiling. They all said that Gong had rashly started an incident, which was not what they meant. Mrs. Zheng also advised him by letter, but she could not save Gong's determination to prohibit opium. He replied and explained his state of mind, saying: "Knowing that opium prohibition hinders the great interests of treacherous Yi and there will be difficulties, but I resolutely and resolutely dare not have any fear, because I have dedicated myself to the country, but I seek to benefit the country and the people, and to eliminate harm to the people. I have put my own life and death aside, and I do not care about praise or blame." From these few words, we can know Gong's hatred of opium and his resolute heart to resist aggression. The British army attacked Guangdong and Fujian and was unsuccessful, so it changed its attack to Dinghai and captured it. Because at that time, the coast had been empty for a long time, and the British side knew that the border officials of the other provinces of our country were ignorant of the times, neglected defense, had uneven steps, and lacked unity; and the court officials were afraid of disaster and blamed Gong. They sent Qi Shan to Guangdong for investigation and ordered the coastal border officials not to lightly fire on foreign ships and cause incidents. On the one hand, they still discussed Qi Shan's preparations for war. Who knew that Qi Shan was mediocre and cowardly, and everything was the opposite of what Gong had done. When he arrived in Guangdong, he completely withdrew the coastal defenses, dispersed the strong men, and abolished the navy, seeking peace with the British with all his heart. The British army took advantage of this opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. The Qing court was shocked and had no choice but to conclude the Treaty of Nanjing with the British, ceding Hong Kong, opening Guangzhou and five other ports for trade, and paying an indemnity of more than 20 million yuan. The opium scourge penetrated deep into the people.</p>
<p>Late Years - Intermittently Requesting Military Reclamation to Eliminate Ethnic Disputes Between Hui and Han</p>
<p>Gong's calligraphy resembles that of Ouyang Xun, and his poetry follows the style of Bai Juyi. When he was in office, he had no time to write poems, but when he was exiled to Yili, he was able to express his thoughts and also write letters, and people at the time imitated him. He stayed in Yili for nearly four years, opening up military reclamation for more than 370,000 hectares, which greatly improved the livelihood of the Hui people. When the general of Yili played a report, Emperor Xuanzong ordered him to act as the governor-general of Shaanxi and Gansu, and then appointed him as the governor. Unfortunately, he overworked himself, and his illness was deeply buried at this time. When he was transferred to the governor-general of Yunnan and Guizhou, he tried to release the ethnic boundaries between the same Han people and serve people with virtue. What is this? The customs of Yunnan are fierce, and bandits are rampant. Since Gong took office, he combined leniency and strictness, used both kindness and power, and the banditry was put down in a few months. The people were able to live in peace. However, since Mrs. Zheng's death, Gong was extremely sad: his old illness recurred, so he resigned and returned home. When he left, the people of Zheng carried wine to send him off, and tens of thousands of people gathered unexpectedly. The following year, Emperor Xuanzong died, and Emperor Wenzong ascended the throne. The Guangxi Hairi bandits started a rebellion, and ordered Gong to suppress it. He struggled to reach Chaozhou, and his diarrhea did not stop. He died in the Puning hostel. The heavens did not mourn, and he lost this pioneer in opium prohibition. The world's philosopher then left the world forever. Gong's great achievements will last forever, but it is a pity that the opium prohibition was not fully completed, and it should be regarded as a regret.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of our party, opium has been suspended as a prohibited item. The Premier also created a legacy of rejecting poison to show us, but in the past 20 years, warlords have been divided, and the environment is complex, so the prohibition policy has not been effective. Now, fortunately, our supreme leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also served as the Opium Prohibition Supervisor, deeply fearing that opium is more than foreign insult. If this disaster is not eliminated, the nation will be difficult to rejuvenate, and the status of the country will be difficult to equalize; therefore, it is enforced vigorously and spared no effort, and stipulates various regulations such as a six-year phased prohibition method, and registration, reporting, and punishment to show compassion. Is it not the case that benevolence is practiced outside the law? We deeply hope that the national people will be vigilant, shuddering at the deep scourge of opium, look up to the government's intention to eliminate poison and do its best, work together, and watch its success, so that we will not fail Chairman Chiang's hard work as Opium Prohibition Supervisor, and the June 3rd Memorial Lin Gong will have true meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Discussion of the Tobacco Prohibition Issue in This City <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Jingjun</p>
<p>Since this city received orders last year to implement tobacco prohibition, the bureau has formulated a yearly plan for complete prohibition and earnestly promoted it with all its might. However, due to obstacles in jurisdiction and the special circumstances, implementation is difficult, quite different from other provinces. Unless the social conditions are carefully considered and prohibition standards are established, it will be difficult to adapt to the environment and achieve twice the result with half the effort. Now, several important issues regarding tobacco prohibition in this city are briefly outlined for discussion.</p>
<p>1.  Emphasize Propaganda to Awaken Smokers: Our country's education is not yet universal, and the people are ignorant, to put it plainly. The working class in the lower strata of this city is numerous. The harm of tobacco and the content of laws are not easily understood by all the people. All sectors of society should pay special attention to propaganda and explain the meaning of tobacco prohibition. For example, the education sector should work hard to educate citizens in literacy, making tobacco prohibition an educational material. The press should take the lead in expressing opinions and guiding the public to engage in anti-drug movements. At the same time, social intellectuals should promote a new lifestyle, encouraging the public to abandon addictions and develop habits of diligence, thrift, and simplicity, fostering a deep hatred and abhorrence of tobacco. All these aspects are intended to enhance the strength of tobacco prohibition, relying on the cooperation of the people and the government to jointly promote it. We should know that the purpose of propaganda is to awaken smokers' automatic consciousness. It is better to use heart-reforming methods to enlighten their inner consciousness and encourage automatic cessation than to rely solely on strict laws and severe punishments to make people fear and dare not commit crimes. Since the bureau started registering smokers, surveys have shown that nearly ten thousand people in this city have quit smoking. Those who quit on their own account for half of that, which is not without the power of propaganda for tobacco prohibition policies. In the future, we should gather the strength of the entire population to step up propaganda to gradually reduce the number of smokers and achieve the goal of complete prohibition within a limited time.</p>
<p>2.  Strictly Prohibit Smuggling to Eliminate the Source of Tobacco Poison: This city has never produced tobacco seedlings. The scope of prohibition is limited to transportation, sales, and smoking. Prohibiting transportation and sales is of utmost importance. If the source of smuggling and illegal sales is not stopped, there is no hope of eliminating tobacco poison. This city has convenient transportation, making it easy to smuggle goods. Unlawful individuals often take advantage of this opportunity to secretly set up dens, dodging here and there, making it impossible to defend against. The difficulty of prohibition reaches its extreme. Now that we are actively investigating and prosecuting tobacco poison, we should seek thorough prohibition methods. On the government side, responsible investigation personnel should study effective methods, unite with local and neighboring police authorities, take the same steps, and cooperate in investigation and prosecution. All transportation and navigation agencies should closely cooperate with investigation personnel to strictly prevent the entry of tobacco poison and order their employees to separately provide joint guarantees to avoid colluding with bandits for secret trafficking. On the public side, they should know that these criminals who transport and sell drugs not only undermine the prohibition policy but are also enemies of mankind. Anyone who hears or sees should act according to their conscience, take responsibility for reporting, and not provide housing for those who manufacture and sell drugs for criminal use, lest they be implicated. According to the above methods, if everyone is of one heart and officials and the people cooperate, smugglers and illegal sellers will have no means to practice their tricks.</p>
<p>3.  Establish More Smoking Cessation Hospitals and Universally Provide Treatment: This city, with its dense population, is prone to harboring dirt and filth. The people are accustomed to luxury and indulging in pleasure. Therefore, those who indulge in opium are everywhere, mostly poor people. In the 24th year of the Republic, 30,833 smokers were registered in this city, of which 17,995 people applied for poor people's licenses, exceeding the number of ordinary license holders by more than five thousand. These poor people usually earn so little from their labor that it is not enough to support their lives. Once addicted to opium, they have no extra strength to quit on their own. Therefore, it is necessary to establish more smoking cessation hospitals to provide free treatment to smokers and guide them on the path to renewal. This city currently has four smoking cessation hospitals with more than 550 beds, but the number of people who can quit each month is only seven or eight hundred. Except for the two hospitals in South Shanghai and North Shanghai, which fully accommodate smokers who voluntarily seek treatment, the temporary drug rehabilitation centers and the attached criminal smoking cessation hospitals are used for the rehabilitation of smokers caught by the year and special districts. However, the number of beds is limited, and there are many criminals, so it is often impossible to provide universal treatment. To increase the efficiency of smoking cessation, it seems necessary to increase the number of smoking cessation hospitals in this city as much as possible. We should cooperate and discuss with the Health Bureau, the tobacco prohibition agencies in this city, and the courts at all levels in the special district, hoping to promote its realization in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>4.  Build Smoker Factories to Improve Smokers' Environment: The harm of opium is enough to injure people's bodies and erode their will. After most smokers become addicted, their careers are ruined, they cannot produce, and they degenerate to the lower classes, unable to recover. After quitting, they relapse due to unstable lives or environmental temptations. Even severe punishment is not a fundamental solution. It is urgent to raise funds to build large-scale smoker factories to accommodate quitters and criminals who have been sentenced and have served their time. All should be taught skills, their minds and bodies confined, and their physiques tempered, so that when the apprenticeship is completed, their laziness is completely eradicated and they become healthy and productive citizens. This is not only beneficial to the promotion of prohibition but also closely related to social security.</p>
<p>The tobacco prohibition issue is complex. The above four points are only a brief overview of the major issues in this city's social situation. We should know that if tobacco poison is not eliminated for one day, the nation will not prosper for one day, and the great cause of restoration will be difficult to achieve for one day. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Entrusting a great task to the difficult is our responsibility. I am willing to encourage each other with the people of this city!</p>
<h3 id="e160">China's Tobacco Prohibition and the International Community <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>The tobacco prohibition movement was originally just a domestic political movement, but in China, it has also become an international movement. The Opium War of 1839 was because China wanted to prohibit opium. The war failed, and under the threat of British guns and cannons, the Chinese government suspended the tobacco prohibition movement. Now, the ugly act of using guns and cannons to interfere with China's tobacco prohibition has not happened again, but the act of using special powers in the treaty to undermine and obstruct China's tobacco prohibition movement still exists. Director-General Chiang Kai-shek of the Anti-Opium Bureau once said painfully, "China's situation in all aspects is relatively special. If the tobacco prohibition matter relies solely on the efforts of the government, it is indeed not easy to achieve thoroughly, because there are many places (especially the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin), and many malpractices (especially foreigners selling drugs in Chinese territory) that the government's power cannot fully reach." This is a very painful thing. On the one hand, we are distressed that there are places within our territory that our government's power cannot reach. On the other hand, we are even more distressed that such a self-evident matter as the tobacco prohibition movement cannot yet obtain consistent sympathy and assistance from the international community in this era.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the International League of Nations Opium Prohibition Committee held a meeting in Geneva. British and American representatives reported that the Japanese government did not take appropriate and effective measures and questioned them. The Japanese representative did not refute it, only saying that "the Japanese authorities do not fully understand everything" and that "the Japanese government has not condoned drug traffickers." It can be seen that the reports of the British and American representatives are quite reliable. This is not only detrimental to China but also greatly affects the world's tobacco prohibition movement.</p>
<p>After reporting on China's tobacco prohibition plan, Chinese representative Hu Shize said, "In 1935, a total of 970 people were executed for illegally selling, smoking, and manufacturing drugs... The life of the country now depends on the struggle against drugs, which we must persevere to the end." Indeed, the prohibition of tobacco poison has become a prerequisite for our nation's revival. We must thoroughly fight against tobacco poison and eradicate its roots according to the tobacco prohibition plan. We hope that the Japanese government will sympathize with us and take effective measures against its people who sell tobacco poison. China's tobacco prohibition movement will naturally benefit greatly, and the honor of the Japanese Empire in the international community will not be tainted, which will greatly help the harmony of national feelings between China and Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Commemorating "June 3rd" and Our Responsibility <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Jingshi</p>
<p>The history of China in the past hundred years can be said to be a dark period of conquest by imperialism. The Opium War was the beginning of this period and the root cause of China's poverty and national weakness.</p>
<p>During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, a large amount of opium was imported annually, and its harmful effects deepened. Although the government had laws prohibiting it, the corruption of officials and the lack of effective enforcement only increased the amount of opium. By the Daoguang period, the government was determined to prohibit it, and the proposals of Lin Zexu, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi at the time, were the most resolute and thorough. His memorial included several of the most vigilant words: "The poison of opium is worse than floods and fierce beasts. There is no one in the world who thinks opium should not be prohibited. If this disaster is not eliminated, there will be no usable soldiers or funds to raise in ten years." He also ordered Guangdong merchants to hand over the opium, and the British merchants initially refused to comply. After troops were sent to surround the business halls, all the drugs were handed over, totaling 20,283 boxes of opium, worth 560,000 taels of silver, which were all burned at Humen. The news spread, and the whole country cheered.</p>
<p>The British merchants, suffering this blow, used this as an excuse to send troops to attack Guangdong. Our side was prepared and did not succeed. They changed their attack to Dinghai, Ningbo, Zhejiang, and attacked Tianjin to the north. The Qing court was greatly shocked. The general ministers did not understand the situation and, instead of planning resistance, dismissed Lin from his post and sent him to Yili, and then agreed to peace with Britain, signing the Treaty of Nanjing, which was humiliating and harmful to the world. This heroic anti-drug war broke out on "June 3rd." Although the result was such a tragic defeat, this defeat was glorious. Because of our painful sacrifice, the whole world recognized our great national character of not hesitating to pay the highest price to seek the right to survival.</p>
<p>Now it has been ninety-seven years since the Opium War. Looking back, not only has the atmosphere of drugs not been completely eliminated, but the flames of drugs are spreading daily. According to customs statistics, from 1876 to 1928, in these 53 years, the import value of opium was 130 million taels of silver, and the amount secretly smuggled in, which was beyond the customs' knowledge, is even more unknown. Such a huge amount of wasteful consumption, how could the country not be poor? In such an environment, when we commemorate this great and tragic "June 3rd," we have infinite pain and feel the great responsibility we have.</p>
<p>From the historical facts of the Opium War, we have learned a great lesson, that a government without determination cannot accomplish an extraordinary undertaking, especially the complex and serious mission of drug prohibition. The ineffectiveness of drug prohibition in the past ninety years is entirely due to this reason. Now the government knows that the past "taxation on prohibition" is not a solution, so it has made the greatest determination and decided on a two-year drug prohibition and a six-year tobacco prohibition plan, promulgating strict laws and strictly enforcing them. However, "laws alone are not enough to enforce themselves," because laws themselves do not generate power and completely rely on the people to abide by and implement them. The efforts of the government alone cannot complete this great mission. Lin Zexu's failure to prohibit opium in the past was because he lacked loyal comrades and did not have group action. Everything relied on one person's spirit, resulting in failure. Therefore, if we want to seek national liberation and break free from the shackles of imperialist chains, the whole nation should be mobilized to jointly eliminate drugs, supervise the government, and support the government in promoting drug prohibition laws. At the same time, we must supervise, encourage, and advise each other to eliminate the atmosphere of drugs so that China can achieve true liberation. This is our reflection and effort in commemorating "June 3rd" today.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Eliminate Tobacco Poison <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>The origin of opium is very early. In the Zhenyuan era of the Tang Dynasty (around 800 AD), Arab merchants had already imported the poppy into China. By the middle of the Ming Dynasty (end of the 15th century), the Portuguese monopolized trade in the East. One of their goods, opium, was also called Afuyong in Chinese, which is a transliteration of the Arabic word "Afion." However, opium was initially used as a medicine to treat dysentery, which can be seen in our country's medical books. It was not expected that its accumulation over time would become a habit. Once not smoked, it would be like a sudden onset of a major illness, even more painful than not eating millet. It also damages the spirit and depletes the body, eventually leading to chronic diseases, and the children born will all become weak. Its harm is equal to that of poisonous drugs, harming oneself, harming others, harming society, harming the country, and harming the nation. Therefore, if this disaster is not eliminated, it is undoubtedly certain that all human beings in the world will be poisoned and overthrown, so we must not be afraid.</p>
<p>Our country suffered this poison, and the originators were indeed the Portuguese. However, in the forty-sixth year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty (1781), the British East India Company obtained the exclusive right to trade with China from its own government. The Bengal region of India was also a production area of opium. Therefore, it was easier to import into China, and the quantity also increased day by day. Throughout the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, strict prohibition laws were established, but when the laws were slightly relaxed, traffickers and smokers would return to their old ways. From the twenty-second year of Jiaqing to the eighteenth year of Daoguang, the increase in imports was almost nine times in more than twenty years. The prevalence of opium imports not only caused various evils in the health and morals of the people but also had a great impact on the social economy. The Qing court was worried about this and considered how to deal with the opium problem. Therefore, the prohibition of opium has become the only urgent problem in politics.</p>
<p>On the twenty-ninth day of the first month of the nineteenth year of Daoguang, our memorialized sage Lin Zexu arrived in Guangdong to investigate opium. Based on his indomitable spirit, he developed a plan to eliminate the poison completely. The following year (1840), the Opium War broke out. British troops repeatedly captured important coastal passes and advanced on Nanjing. The Qing court then sent Guangzhou General Qiying and others of the imperial clan to the British warships to discuss the conditions for peace. On August 29, 1842, the envoys of the two countries formally signed the thirteen articles of the Treaty of Jiangning.</p>
<p>Today, after our pain has settled, we should have the greatest awareness of this national "Tobacco Prohibition Day" to eliminate this poisonous substance that destroys the foundation of the country so that we will not fail the teachings of Lin Zexu to us.</p>
<p>Now, our country's government has decided on a comprehensive tobacco prohibition plan, with the momentum to destroy it as if eating breakfast. Our Chairman Chiang, who is also the Director-General of Tobacco Prohibition, has the greatest determination to oversee all matters related to tobacco and drug prohibition throughout the country. In this regard, the people of the country should uphold the government's intentions and assist indirectly and directly to achieve the success of the tobacco prohibition plan and seek the revival of the country and the nation. In this dangerous national situation, we have no other way to follow than self-reliance. The harm of opium, harming the country and stupefying the people, is known to everyone. Its most obvious harm is the damage to the social economy. Why do I say that? Because there are so many smokers, the amount of money spent on smoking is staggering, and its impact on production is unknown! Looking ahead and behind, we cannot help but sigh with emotion. It is hoped that people with lofty ideals and patriotic compatriots will rise up to eliminate it.</p>

<p>Limited Funding, Vigorous Promotion: Mr. Cheng Chizhi, Director of Education in Hubei Province, attended the meeting of department heads and commissioners convened by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education's special education conference for five provinces. He arrived in Beijing yesterday. A reporter visited him, intending to inquire about the province's education situation. Seeing that Mr. Cheng had just finished his journey and was busy with visitors, the reporter only asked about the situation of compulsory education and special education. He replied, and a brief summary is as follows: The province of Hubei promotes compulsory education with funding of 270,000 yuan, of which 130,000 yuan is provided by the central government through subsidies from the Ministry of Education, and 140,000 yuan is raised by the province. Although the funding is limited, it has been able to realize the plan. Recently, 900 new elementary schools have been promoted. As for compulsory education in various counties, it was originally planned that each county would add more than 5,000 Lianbao elementary schools (thousands of existing schools were outside), which would cost more than one million yuan. Due to natural and man-made disasters, it has been slightly affected. The provincial department is working hard to supervise and promote it. Now, more than 3,000 Lianbao elementary schools have been added in various counties, and the original plan will be achieved soon. The special education funding in Hubei Province is only 80,000 yuan per year, which is used for leadership and experimental work. The Zhongshan People's Schools in various counties are used as units for promotion. The teachers of the People's Schools assist the local government in promoting education, cultivation, and health work, divided into three types of classes: children, adults, and women. There are more children's classes. Currently, more than 100 classes have been established in various counties, which is quite effective. In addition, civic training classes are also held. In addition to teaching required courses, they also provide group life training. Each term lasts four months, and the third term has been completed.</p>

<p>Heard That the Fifth Term is Scheduled to Start in July</p>
<p>The fourth term of the municipal literacy school in this city has been in session since March 1st. Now that the three-month term is over, the municipal government sent personnel to various schools to conduct examinations in the past two days. It is heard that since the municipal government implemented compulsory literacy education in July last year, the original plan was to eliminate all illiteracy in the urban area within one year. However, the period of literacy school was extended to three months, and only four terms were held in one year. Therefore, the number of graduates only accounts for half of the total number of illiterate people. Although this year is coming to an end, in order to thoroughly eliminate illiteracy, it has been decided to continue to hold it in the next year. However, the implementation method may be changed. Literacy school teachers still need to be trained intensively. The period for the start of the fifth term is probably in mid-July.</p>

<h3 id="e180">China-France Davis Cup Match Report <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Nianxian</p>
<p>The French Have a Very Good Impression of Zheng Zhaojia and Lin Baohua</p>
<p>(Paris Correspondence) I am very fond of tennis. Considering the domestic enthusiasts, I would like to inform the Chinese people about the Sino-French battle in the Davis Cup. Of course, you all know the result of the score. What is described here is a more detailed record and comments from all parties. My selfless criticism is also frankly stated below.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of May 1st, under cloudy skies and in a gentle breeze, the Sino-French Davis Cup match began. In the first singles match, Xu Chengji faced Boossus. Under a non-tense situation, he sent two sets in a row, creating a rare record with 6-0, 6-0. In the third set, he stayed a bit on the surface and ended the game with 6-1. The French newspaper said that the competition failed to show Boossus's skills and there was nothing to describe. However, I want to remind readers of a few points. Mr. Boossus is a world-renowned player with many years of experience. No player in our country can be his opponent. In addition, Mr. Xu is not physically strong, and he was also affected by the wind and waves on the 25th. The field was unfamiliar and the climate was unaccustomed. The truth is excusable. However, the audience cannot understand it, Mr. Xu's movements are too slow, he is unwilling to do his best, he only seeks to parry, and does not seek to make progress. Thinking back to Mr. Xu's success in China, it is really puzzling. Or it is predicted that his physical condition is not good, and I think that is the reason. In the second game, the situation of Zheng Zhaojia against Destremau was completely changed. Zheng immediately scored a game when he came on the court. When the opponent saw that the situation was not right, he cautiously responded to the enemy, and took both offense and defense. He finally won the first set 6-1. After this set of confrontation, Mr. Zheng got the hang of it, and his skills were also more novel. He eventually lost the second set with 3-6. The third set gradually improved. He took the lead with 2-1 at the beginning. Encouraged by more than 100 compatriots, he was full of energy and worked hard to fight. Blood reached 4 times 2, and then became a draw. Mr. Te regained the victory with a serve, and became 5-6. Although the French side had a superior situation, their energy was exhausted. Mr. Zheng's balls were calm, such as winning three consecutive serves, resulting in a 6-6 tie. He won the third set with 8-6 after repeatedly winning with backhand heavy shots. After a ten-minute break, the fourth set began. Mr. Zheng took the lead again with 2-0. The opponent was terrified and gave up offense in favor of defense. Mr. Zheng's online skills were poor, so he did not win. However, the air was unusually tense. Later, due to fairness, Mr. Zheng lost consecutively and became 2-3. Then from 3 to 3 to 3-6, and lost the fourth set.</p>
<p>The competition on the first day ended. The French newspaper gave a very good evaluation of Mr. Zheng. It admired his brave spirit, and believed that his strength should be above Mr. Xu, and allowed him to be listed at the end of the world's first-class players.</p>
<p>On the second day, the weather was clear and sunny. Xu Chengji and Lin Shihua took the stage to face the enemy and competed with the French Borotra and Benrand. Although Mr. Xu was active, he still lacked highlights, while Lin Shihua won a lot of applause with his shots and online skills. The upper hand is always unfamiliar, and the first set failed 6-1. However, due to the two gentlemen's loyalty and courage, the second set was created from 1-3 to a 3-3 tie. The French side saw that the situation was tense, and Borotra showed off his skills, and eventually lost the second set with 1-6. According to convention, the turning point is often in the third set. Looking at our side's victory, the French side borrowed the remaining prestige of the victory and took the lead with 2-0. However, after Ba's serve, it was repeatedly unfavorable, and it became a 2-1. Xu Chengji's shots this time were unusually successful. After five engagements, it became a 3-2 tie. After several hard-fought battles, our side took the lead with 4-3. After that, both sides often went online, and the excitement was unusual. Our enemy each got one game, resulting in a 5-4 advantage. When it was Lin Shihua's turn to serve, he hit hard with his arm, and the ball was close to the line. The opponent had difficulty returning the ball, and our army won three consecutive balls, and then won the third set with 6-4 with Lin's clever net blocking. After a 15-minute break, he went on stage again. Mr. Xu often made mistakes, causing the enemy to take the lead with 3-0. When it was Mr. Xu's turn to hit the ball, Mr. Xu cheered up to fight and won two consecutive games, resulting in a ratio of 2 to 3. Then Benrand's net blocking was effective, and he made beautiful moves from time to time. Our side was defeated with 1-1 due to poor contact. After these three games, our country has been eliminated. But the two singles on the third day continued. That night, the newspapers also praised Lin for his playing, but regretted that the two had poor contact. The result of the game on the third day was predictable. However, the most noteworthy thing was the game between Zheng Zhaojia and Boossus. In the fourth game, Xu Chengji first played against Destremau. Because Mr. Xu saw that the opponent was weaker, he was slightly bolder, so he attacked more. It was a pity that it was still too late, so he lost the first two sets with 3-6 and 2-6. However, his steady cross-corner shots were really skillful and should not be buried. Therefore, he often used good moves and won the third set with 6-4. After resting for ten minutes according to regulations, he fought again with a spiritual mind. The French side knew that Mr. Te's strength was weak and feared failure, so he cared for and loved him and helped him especially. It was a pity that Mr. Xu was defeated with 2-6. However, to be fair, Mr. Te is only eighteen and a half years old and is participating in the Davis Cup for the first time this year. I hope Mr. Xu will work hard to make progress and comfort the public's expectations.</p>
<p>After Mr. Xu finished the game, Mr. Zheng played against Boossus. The result was not outstanding. The score was 6-0, 6-0, 6-0, which was similar to Mr. Xu's. But his efforts in the game and his courage to chase the ball were really admirable. Mr. Pu's game against Zheng was no longer as easy as against Xu, and he sometimes felt difficult to deal with. Looking at the number of balls returned in the first set, you can see that there was a fierce battle. Mr. Zheng's shots against Mr. Pu mostly went to his left hand at first. This is the usual tactic. However, when the enemy uses his left hand, the strategy should be changed. The main reason for Mr. Zheng's failure in one set was this. In the last two sets, Mr. Zheng changed to shooting at the enemy's right hand, and Mr. Pu had difficulty coping with it. This is why the game in the second set was relatively close. In short, although Mr. Zheng and Mr. Xu both lost, the process was more beautiful. The French newspaper never stopped praising his bravery. I also wish Mr. Zheng hard work and unlimited future.</p>

<p>The gold market continues to rise due to major Chinese merchants hoarding US dollars and a tight currency market. However, with heavy selling by firms like Dadecheng, the overall trend is uncertain and fluctuating. Initially, a foreign telegram reported that the London market was closed and the New York silver market was inactive. The forward silver price in Montreal rose by 7 to 22 cents. Exchange rates were slightly longer. The Central Bank announced that the official exchange rates for British and US currencies were unchanged, and the customs unit remained unchanged. The official standard gold price was 1132.4 yuan. The over-the-counter preliminary trading opened at 42 yuan, slightly lower, and Dadecheng and others immediately sold, resulting in a lower opening price.

However, due to major merchants maintaining their positions at lower prices and Chinese merchants actively hoarding US currency, the price soon rose. The HSBC official exchange rates for British and US currencies were unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also unchanged. There was some fluctuation in the middle of the session, but due to the tight domestic market and strong demand, the price eventually rose. Later, the market leveled off slightly as sellers took profits at higher prices. The general trend hovered at noon.

<p>Recently, exchange rates have been relatively stable due to adjustments by the three banks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the currency market tightened due to Chinese merchants rushing to hoard US dollars, leading to tighter forward exchange rates. Initially, an overseas telegram reported that the London market was completely closed and the New York silver market was inactive. The forward silver price in Montreal rose by 7 to 22 cents. The US dollar was strong against the British pound at 0.0625, and the US dollar rose against the French franc by 25. The Central Bank announced that the official exchange rates for British and US currencies were unchanged, and the customs gold unit was unchanged. The currency market opened in the morning with recent selling prices: 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 375 for the British pound, and 29.875 yuan for the US dollar. Compared with the previous close, British and US currencies were unchanged. After the opening, the Japanese banks offered Eastern currency, and banks slightly sold US dollars, while Chinese merchants were quite strict in hoarding. HSBC announced that the official exchange rates for British and US currencies were unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was unchanged. However, the market gradually tightened. Shanghai came to offer US dollars, and the three banks continued to offer spot shillings. After that, the market stabilized slightly, and the overall trend was fluctuating. Although Chinese merchants actively hoarded US dollars, the market was still flat at noon because banks provided ample supply. In the afternoon session, major Chinese merchants came to hoard US dollars for eight-day delivery, and the process was slightly tight. Later, the market gradually leveled off as banks, such as the Bank of England, vigorously sold. Jiaotong Bank and foreign banks swapped exchange rates. Finally, the market fluctuated.

<h3 id="e192">The Financial Atmosphere at the Beginning of the Month Seems Promising <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>During the past month, the silver dollar market and money shops were unwilling to lend, and most of the banks' business was restricted by economic factors, hindering development. Therefore, the overall financial atmosphere was inactive. Recently, it has been speculated that with the spring harvest in the north and brisk sales in Shanghai, export trade has also been greatly stimulated. As a result, the silver and money industries, the financial hub, have also slightly benefited from some exchange business, and the circulation of funds seems to be much more promising than before. However, yesterday's interbank lending rates for silver dollars remained at nine points, with a seemingly active surface but actually more transactions in the reserve funds. The transaction volume of interbank notes was over 2.7 million in the morning session, over 200,000 in new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon session, over 100,000 in the Small General Association, over 500,000 in banknote issuance, and over 100,000 in other locations. The redemption amount of silver collateral transactions was over 400,000, and new loans made were over 600,000. Bank collection and settlement: foreign banks collected and settled over 2.5 million in bills, over 3.2 million in various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous fees, over 200,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 300,000 in special remittances. Chinese banks collected and settled over 3.3 million in bills, over 2.6 million in various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous fees, over 100,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 200,000 in special remittances. Japanese banks collected and settled over 1.9 million in bills, over 2.5 million in various exchange and miscellaneous fees, over 200,000 in telegraphic transfers, and over 100,000 in special remittances. Money shops collected and settled over 41.1 million in silver dollar public bills and over 2.8 million in silver dollar drafts, as well as over 400,000 in remittances from various locations. In the subsidiary currency market, the morning session traded 15,000 yuan of Guangjiao coins. There were no transactions in Jiangnan small silver coins, and the unofficial market price remained at 12.01 cents. There was no change in the copper coin market, so 10,587 strings and 500 coins were exchanged, equivalent to 3,500 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>In addition, the total number of bills cleared by the local bill clearing house on the 2nd was 60,025,4271.93 yuan in national currency, including 19,715,515.53 yuan in exchange, 37,600,3728.67 yuan in transfers, 1,710,218.94 yuan collected by money shops, and 1,224,810.79 yuan collected by others. The interest rate for public bill loans from the joint reserve committee of the Bankers' Association was 10 cents per thousand yuan per day. The discount rate for bankers' acceptance bills with a 90-day term was 10 cents per thousand yuan per day.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Securities Bond Market Sees Short Covering by Retail Investors <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw some easing due to the situation in North China. Public bonds rebounded due to some short covering. This rebound was expected and was nothing more than a sedative for the longs. The current situation, after this excessive rise, will likely be one of fluctuation and decline. Yesterday, retail investors covered their shorts, and the December 35th and other issues saw considerable buying interest. Many investors also went long due to temporary favorable environmental factors. Both Class A and Class B bonds rose by half a yuan, and the rest also rose by 30 to 40 cents. The aftershocks of the final settlement had not subsided, and Class C bonds rose by another 40 cents, with the rest also being firm. Retail investors were very enthusiastic about going long. The afternoon session opened with the 5th issue being particularly strong. This month's Class D bonds rose sharply by 45 cents. After entering the market, the 14th, 21st, and 54th issues saw some selling. Class A and Class B bonds fell slightly by 5 to 10 cents, and the closing trend was weakening. Class E bonds fell slightly by 25 cents, and the rest also fell mostly by 10 to 20 cents. Class A, Class B, and Class C bonds saw no rise or fall. The excessive rebound over the course of the day may trigger the emergence of more longs. As a result, market prices rose by 35 to 70 cents, and 96 also rebounded by 25 cents. The total transaction volume was 6,205,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e194">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Gradually Calming Down <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, and the situation gradually calmed down. It was reported that the Hebei-Chahar authorities had expressed their efforts to maintain local security, and people's hearts were stable. At the same time, although the spot yarn business has not seen much development, the selling price is very firm. However, the amount of yarn accumulated in warehouses is considerable, and this cotton yarn still lacks the ability to be sold. The short's intentions are still quite firm.</p>
<p>The price of marked yarn is nearly flat and far up</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market in the morning was slightly tight due to the continued rise in foreign cotton. The prices of the months rose by 30 to 40 cents. Unexpectedly, the market atmosphere was not good when the second session opened, and there was more speculation. The prices of the months fell by 70 to 80 cents. However, a certain aspect was calm. Until the close, the longs pulled up slightly and saw a rebound. As a result, the prices of the months fell by 10 to 30 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The situation turned better when the afternoon session opened. The rumors subsided, and the sales of spot yarn in Sichuan were smooth and healthy, and the short covered, and the market price advanced step by step. As a result, the prices of the months rose by 20 to 60 cents compared with the closing price in the morning. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,500 bales, Jinchang 350 bales, Hengde 650 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Renfeng 900 bales, Yicheng 450 bales, Dachangcheng 1,550 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Yongda 400 bales, Heyu 650 bales, and Xiesheng 1,100 bales. Juyu bought 1,350 bales, Heyu 1,350 bales, Gengfeng 500 bales, Xingchang 900 bales, Fengtai 650 bales, Runtang 650 bales, Shengyuan 850 bales, Xincheng 900 bales, Yongchang 650 bales, and Yicheng 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Still Good</p>
<p>Sichuan rods are still interested in spot yarn. Xingquan and Jing each bought a total of 880 bales, and the selling price was flat. The buying amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Number of Cotton Sellers Seems to Be Decreasing <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm because Indian cotton is soaring. The price of White Roy cotton for July and August rose sharply to 212 rupees and 75 paise. The situation in the US cotton market is also stable, and people's hearts are slightly better. However, market discussions show that the previous long positions in coarse-staple cotton have not been sold well, and the market price is high. New longs still lack the ability to be excited.</p>
<p>Jinchang covers short on Marked flowers</p>
<p>The opening of the marked flower market in the morning was firm due to the stimulus of the rise in foreign cotton. However, buyers in the market were not very enthusiastic. During the second session, the selling pressure was heavy due to the weakness of the yarn market. The prices of the months fell by 20 cents. By the third closing, Xincheng, Jinchang, and Changhe and other firms covered shorts in unison, and the prices turned up again. As a result, the prices of the months rose by 5 to 15 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. The atmosphere was tight when the afternoon session opened, and the number of sellers decreased. Spot cotton factories needed scattered transactions, which could still be maintained, and the popularity of the market tended to be good. As a result, the prices of the months rose by 5 to 20 cents compared with the closing price in the morning. It was found that Shenchang sold 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 1,500 dan, Tongji 900 dan, Mingde 1,300 dan, Changfeng 1,400 dan, Xiesheng 2,400 dan, Tonghe 1,000 dan, Xinchang 1,800 dan, and Yuanxingchang 3,100 zu.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Fine Flannel Factories Are Still Busy</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still considered to be substandard, and factory demand is continuous, but most of it is fine-staple cotton. The source is 260 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>

<p>The amount of yarn stored in the warehouses of the local yarn and cloth exchange, as of the end of May, was 33,210 bales, an increase of 1,310 bales compared with the previous time. Among them, the most was 1400 bales of 20-count Hong Kui Xing yarn. The yarn of Jue Tian Guanqi, balloon, Feiting, Jincheng, Jincheng golden chicken and twin deer etc. are 2,150 bales to 3,950 bales.

<h3 id="e197">U.S. Cotton Buying Interest Suddenly Seems Brisk <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday U.S. cotton opened, with each month up one to three pounds per point. In the early morning, there was a lack of rain in the east, and brokers and peers bought. Some Japanese companies bought at a limit price, covering sales and closing long positions, all of which were absorbed. Textiles were more active, and the fear of the cotton industry trading law in the Smith case had moved, which also aroused the interest of those who were happy. It is a pity that at one point, when the stored cotton was at 11.6 cents, the sale of July caused the closure of longs, and the closing was stable. Spot was up two points per pound, and futures were up two to nine points per pound. British cotton was closed, and Indian cotton was bought by longs for the July-August White Luo River, and spot traders and European exporters dropped the sales of July-August. The future is still firm due to short covering and transfers to the forward period. It is estimated that the Pingguo rose by 2 rupees, Oumla rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and the White Luo River rose by 2 to 3.75 rupees. Original telegraph recorded on the left (Day 1 telegraph).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast of White Luo River on the 2nd was 211 rupees, down 1.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<p>Three products, the futures yarn rose by 2 to 8 cents. The near month is 194 yuan and 3 cents, and the far month is 192.5 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 1 to 3 cents. The near month is 63.2 yuan and the far month is 59.1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Piece Goods Japanese fine twill all look weak <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin sells smuggled cotton cloth in abundance</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was still undeveloped, and people's hearts were difficult to cheer up. Japanese fine twill was also weak due to the price drop of fine twill in this factory, which was about 10 cents per piece lower than a week ago. For example, the highest price of Yanghe fine twill last week was 6 yuan and 9 cents per piece. Now, it is 6 yuan, 7 cents and half a cent. The sales of Donghuo fine cloth are flat, and the sales are still good. Due to the firm and expensive factory plate of Qingdao goods, there is a lack of spot goods of blue-day fine cloth, and the prices are firm. The sales of Wufu Xiang fine cloth are the best. The factory produces more than 40 packages per day, which is not enough to meet the demand. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce opened more than 200 pieces of Flying Fish fine cloth. This factory only traded 10 to 20 pieces of fine cloth for each brand, and the fine twill was more vivid. Guangdong and Yunnan continued to handle 200 pieces of Changzhou small weaving factory's fine twill, but the sales plate did not move. Tianjin merchants sell a large amount of smuggled goods in Tianjin, "mostly printed cloth and piece goods." Silver is blocked, so the Shanghai factory's sorted goods and natural color cloth, which are lacking in smuggled goods, are also affected, and because the profits are small, they only aim to respond to the market slightly. Color silk is recently selling well, so there are continued purchases.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reported price of floral car crepe cloth was 3 yuan and 15 cents per piece, which was a mistake of 3 cents and 1.5 cents per yard. This was a typo when writing the manuscript, and is now corrected.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Silk and Tea White Silk Factories Slightly Have Foreign Companies Going <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yokohama silk market was closed due to the holiday, but the Yokohama silk price closing market on the previous day fell sharply, with the recent closing price being 625 yuan and the far-month November being 623 yuan. As a result, the New York silk market also weakened. Yesterday, the local white silk and foreign company silk exchanges were slightly sold, and purchased by Dachang foreign company. The market situation was also clear and tired.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Silk Gang also imported a large number of rayon <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Rayon sales are turning smoother, because local companies and Hangzhou gangs have all purchased it. It is estimated that 250 No. 1 Fuji brand boxes can be transferred to the mainland, priced at 115 yuan. Without tax, 300 No. 1 Hiroshima brand boxes, priced at 400 yuan. More than 10 boxes of 120 No. 1 Tianqiao brand boxes, priced at 380 yuan. More than 10 boxes of 120 No. 1 Jin Huanxing brand boxes, priced at 375 yuan. Those that cannot be transferred to the mainland include more than 20 boxes of 150 No. 1 China Beauty brand boxes, priced at 355 yuan, more than 20 boxes of 150 No. 1 Tianqiao brand boxes, priced at 360 yuan, and 10 boxes of 100 No. 3 Xuelong boxes, priced at more than 400 yuan. Matt silk sales are very strong, but the transactions are now less, because the bottom of each inventory has been exhausted. The current 100 No. Flying Lion brand is the most popular.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Wuyuan Zhenmei Yuan Tea Opens <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign company's red and green tea trading continued to be brisk. British firms such as Yihe Jinlong Baochang and other firms advanced Qi Men Fuliang Zhide and other routes of black tea in large quantities. The entire city has sold more than 30 characters by the promotion team of the Anhui Jiangxi Black Tea General Transport and Sales Office. The top plate opened at 210 yuan, and the situation was still quite lively. To the green tea market, it is also greatly developed. Wuyuan East Road's core-pulled Zhenmei green tea has been opened by Baochang and Tianyu at 140 yuan. There are many other Zhenmei transactions on each route, especially the core pulling is selling well. The price of Tunxi core pulling is 133 yuan to 140 yuan, and the price of Suian core pulling is 117 yuan to 130 yuan. Tianyu Dudu Yongxing Tongfu and other firms have all progressed. Tunxi Zhenmei transactions are also surging, and the price is 88 yuan to 100 yuan. Ping Shui Zhu Tea trading is lighter, and only Yongfa Tianxiang has a small number of Huai office prices still at 55 yuan. The entire city traded a total of more than 4,300 boxes of red and green tea, and the situation was very firm and smooth.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Food Flour and Wheat Were Raised by Rain <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, each month consistently showed a stable sign. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago had four points of ups and downs, and the small triangles of Canada were quoted separately. At the time of the opening price, the weather was hot and muggy, and it was rainy, so people inside and outside the industry were optimistic about the surface, and June was a critical juncture. If it rains for a long time, new flour will be difficult to produce, so the opening price is 12 points, and the forward is also good for another point. However, transactions have not been smooth. Most insiders are watching. Until the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere in June continued to be lucrative, with a maximum of 3 yuan and 55 and a half cents, and the forward was also increased by nearly one cent. Immediately, the longs returned slightly, and the market atmosphere turned slightly flat, going back one cent from the peak. The future situation should be transferred by God.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month showed stable. The weather was not good because it was not raining heavily, and the weather was not good. Each month's market and it should be rain, so the industry's thoughts are consistently stable. Each month's market has risen by 30 to 50 cents. Returning to the afternoon opening, the transaction was quite smooth, because the buyers were more visible. Each month continued to increase by 10 to 20 cents. In this case, if the weather is sunny, it is still soft, otherwise it should be promoted. At present, there are few transactions in the wheat market, and the price has not gone up or down. Opening Shandong wheat called Yuansanjia Ban, counted 300 packages, handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>American wheat, there is no rain in the Northwest, and Canada is also early, but the Southwest has begun to harvest, and the set sales are coming soon. It can be seen that the supply is estimated to decrease by 1,290,000 bushels, and the Canadian wheat is estimated to decrease by 2,533,000 bushels.</p>
<h3 id="e203">New Broad Bean Market Gradually on the Right Track <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Wenzhou's new broad beans are still constantly arriving, but the way to go is not smooth, so the market is not easy to develop. However, the overall situation is that the new goods on each route cannot be launched immediately, and the market is on the right track. Yesterday, more than 100 packages were picked up by this street, and the price was 4 yuan and 3 yuan and 6 cents. Soybeans were flat, and although the price of oil rose by 2 cents, the sales were not surging, and people's hearts were soft. Tongshi opened two cars of Harbin beans, 200 packages of Dingjiazhou beans, 370 packages of Dudousha yellow beans, and 8,122 packages of Jiujiang winter beans.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Rice Retail Is Still Waiting <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang were particularly large compared to the previous, and a total of more than 30 numbers arrived (a total of more than 7,000 stones), and the retail road was not good again. The package only handled 400 to 500 packages. Therefore, the market is in a fixed state, and the price of thick and thin japonica rice is not honorable. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan are also similar.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 27-8 numbers from the river. In the market, the sales of white japonica rice in the early market were excellent, and the price still wanted to be tightened. Later, due to the continuous rain, retail sales turned light, and the market stood firm. The retail sales of Bo Dao and Yin Aiyuan are not bad, and the price is tight for several points to nearly a corner. Du Kejian sales are still good, and the price is tight for several points. The other goods are firmly priced.</p>
<h3 id="e205">North and South Goods New Dried Lily Flowers Still Not Certain <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Daylily, recently, because the sales of Fujian and Guangdong gangs have been still and immobile, the trend is gradually downstream. However, although the market price has fallen, it is not as bad as the rumors. At present, there are only sporadic transactions. For example, Xuzhou cuisine was still sold for 23-4 yuan two days ago, and the top village cuisine was called 26-7 yuan. The industry is very low on the price of goods because the goods in hand have not been sold. This is a natural phenomenon in sluggish times. As for how the new goods will be drained, there is still no certainty. It is necessary to wait for the debut. If the weather is sunny, the new vegetables will be yellow and bright in color, and the identity can be drier. Otherwise, the color of the vegetables is easy to fade, and it is not very suitable for sale, and the old Chen cuisine still has room for activity. The date of the new season is in this month.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Industrial Inventors <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Invention is a good sign of progress in industry. What our people lack most is the ability to invent things. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Boling once said, "Europeans and Americans create, Japanese imitate, and Chinese do nothing." This is such a shameful thing. However, recently I feel that the interest of Chinese people in inventing things is becoming stronger day by day. Last year, according to statistics, there were thirty-eight cases of inventions by Chinese people that were submitted to the Ministry of Industry for patent and exclusive rights. It is unknown how much brainpower and effort was spent, how much measurement was used, and how many difficulties were overcome to achieve such a small accomplishment. These admirable inventors are the treasures of the country, the glory of the Chinese nation, and especially the most honorable page in the history of Chinese industry.</p>
<p>Recently, I visited three factories: one is the pressure vegetable oil lamp invented by Mr. Zhong Ling of the China Oil Lamp Factory, one is the month, day, week, hour clock invented by Mr. Ruan Shunfa of the China Educational Toy Factory, and the other is the free five-use light bulb invented by Mr. Bao Yimin of the Qite Free Light Bulb Factory. After my visit, I felt that these three kinds of appliances are all necessities for daily life. Vegetable oil lamps can make better use of domestic vegetable oil, laying the foundation for national self-sufficiency, and their effect is especially great. What is most commendable is that Ruan Shunfa came from a shipyard worker background, and Bao Yimin is a worker at a power company. They already have a deep understanding, and they are able to painstakingly study things, work hard on research, spend three or four years of effort, painstakingly and tirelessly, to achieve such accomplishments. I am very admirable. And I express that following the efforts of Ruan and Bao, China's future will definitely be very promising. I think that the number of college graduates in China year after year is no less than several thousand, all complaining that there is nothing to do, no occupation, and no opportunity to develop their talents. But I have searched through the inventors and found that very few are college students. Where is the contribution of college students? Reflecting on oneself, one can only be speechless. And Ruan and Bao were able to create things as workers and make this kind of contribution. Moreover, among the inventors, none have received advanced education. We are very ashamed, and I think many college students should be ashamed. Therefore, I think that the government should give as much encouragement, support, and assistance to inventors as possible in the future, so that there will be more and more inventors in the future, and China's industry will have hope for regeneration.</p>
<h3 id="e207">My Views on National Goods Awards <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Li Boshu</p>
<p>The prosperity of a country is, in any case, directly proportional to the development of its industry and commerce. When a country's domestic goods industry develops, naturally, foreign goods will have no way to invade, or at least they will not be able to stand firm in the country. Therefore, enabling the domestic goods industry to develop to the greatest extent is the fundamental, thorough, and proactive way to revive the national economy. Of course, in our external relations, we should resolutely resist the invasion of foreign goods; and internally, we should only strive for the development of the domestic goods industry. This is as practical and effective as a person striving to strengthen their own physical strength to resist the invasion of external germs.</p>
<p>Then, to seek the development of the domestic goods industry, on the one hand, we must work hard to promote it, but the government must also have an expression of encouragement, so that the domestic goods industry can fully manufacture more perfect products, so that the public can truly enjoy using them. This way, we can give foreign goods a strong blow. Therefore, I believe that national goods awards are indeed necessary. This key can indeed affect the prosperity of the national economy.</p>
<p>Secondly, what I want to explain is that the so-called national goods awards are completely different from patent rights, etc. Although their nature is the same in terms of encouragement, the methods are completely different. In my opinion, this fund should be raised by the Ministry of Industry in advance, and a large-scale (national) national goods exhibition should be held every year. People should be sent by the government to evaluate them on the spot (of course, this work is very difficult, but as long as more people are sent to criticize, at least some subjectivity can be avoided). The top-quality products should be selected and recorded in detail, and the award money should be distributed to the producers separately. In this way, not only can it create a kind of fierce competition in the national goods industry, but it can also give everyone in the national goods industry the opportunity to observe.</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that the domestic goods industry will conduct joint discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Anti-Smoking Day and the Promotion of National Medicine <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Today, June 3rd, is the National Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Day designated by the National Government. All parts of the country are enthusiastically carrying out anti-smoking and anti-drug propaganda, which is indeed a very meaningful and valuable work. From the standpoint of revitalizing the nation, it is especially felt to be a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, anti-drug and anti-smoking propaganda is of course very important and urgent. During the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Lin Zexu, who strongly advocated strictly prohibiting opium, once said: "If China does not strictly prohibit opium, then in ten years, not only will there be no usable soldiers, but there will also be no funds to raise..." Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, also said: "Any revolutionary government vows not to compromise with opium drugs!" It is already very clear that opium should be strictly prohibited, and there is no need to say more here! However, on the one hand, we should certainly support the government's efforts to implement the anti-smoking plan. At the same time, on the other hand, we should also work hard to promote the national medicine movement. That is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Why do we want to shout out the slogan of promoting the national medicine movement on the Anti-Smoking Day today? We know that most of the gentlemen are addicted to opium because they gradually became addicted when they were sick and wanted to treat their illnesses. After becoming addicted, they cannot help but smoke every day, so they are always drunk beside the opium bed, wasting time, losing their jobs, and losing their family fortunes. All of this is due to the initial carelessness, which leads to a tragic ending.</p>
<p>Our promotion of the national medicine movement is to ensure that people in general, when they are sick, must not approach opium, and must not have the idea that smoking opium will cure their ailments. It must be known that opium is a kind of poison that kills without bloodshed. Anyone who comes into contact with it will be harmed by it. Moreover, among the national medicines, there are many medicines that are far superior to opium, and will never be addictive after taking them. Today, when the national anti-smoking day is held, the author has specially put forward the slogan of promoting the national medicine movement, which may not be a meaningless thing.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Review of the Use of Domestic Raw Materials for Civil Servants' Uniforms <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Qin</p>
<p>The Central Government recently instructed all national party departments, agencies, groups, schools, etc., to wear formal attire when holding the Premier's Memorial Week. Men: black mandarin jacket and blue robe or Zhongshan suit; women: long jacket or shirt and skirt. Must be clean and simple, and the color should be suitable for the season. Uniform raw materials should all use domestic goods. Due to the point that the uniforms use domestic raw materials, we have to have a review of the necessity of this.</p>
<p>Civil servants are models for the public and must lead the masses by setting an example in everything. This time, the Central Government instructed that civil servants' uniforms must use domestic goods. As a matter of course, we do not need these four words "use domestic goods" to be notified. In fact, the minds of Chinese people have become everywhere subject to the restraint of others and cannot grasp their own initiative to do things. Therefore, the uniforms of civil servants, who are models for the people, must also add the order of the four words "use domestic goods."</p>
<p>When we see ordinary civil servants, including leaders of party, government, military, and police agencies, and middle and senior officials, and use sharp eyes to estimate the clothing on their bodies, speaking from our own conscience, how many use pure domestic silk and cloth to make uniforms? They not only make expensive imported fabrics into neat Western suits and Zhongshan suits, but also cannot find anything on their bodies made of domestic raw materials. They take care of all their own "foreign goods" and shout the slogan of promoting "domestic goods," whether in gatherings, speeches, or between the lines, are not they encouraging the public to use "domestic goods" together? This is simply the extreme of contradiction, which invisibly loses the people's faith in using domestic goods.</p>
<p>Indeed, "leading by example" is not an easy thing. Empty talk and high-sounding slogans are things that everyone can do. Anyway, doing it in a practical and realistic way must be done with perseverance and determination.</p>
<p>So I earnestly hope that the authorities will seriously consider the issue of "using domestic goods" for civil servants' uniforms. I think there are the following two ways to make civil servants' uniforms use pure domestic raw materials:</p>
<p>The government designates pure raw materials made of domestic silk or cotton fabrics produced by domestic goods manufacturers, and orders party, government, military, police agencies, groups, schools, etc. in various provinces and cities to uniformly use the clothing materials produced by the factory to make uniforms. The clothing material colors must be in season, and the government determines the purchase and manufacture, and the styles must be consistent to achieve the goal of economic simplicity, beauty and neatness.</p>
<p>Civilian officials must wear black mandarin jackets and blue robes, which has been clearly ordered, but the black mandarin jackets and blue robes must be limited to the use of domestic cloth or silk, and imported clothing materials must not be purchased. The same applies to military officer uniforms, ordering party, government, military, police agencies, groups, schools, etc. in various provinces and cities to uniformly obey, and formulate reward and punishment measures for civil servants using domestic goods, and commend or admonish based on whether civil servants use domestic goods or not. This measure must be supervised and implemented by the highest officials, and can be included in the performance appraisal measures for civil servants.</p>
<p>The former of the above two points can give domestic goods the opportunity to be sold to civil servants and national agencies throughout the country, and can enable domestic goods manufacturers to have the convenience of developing the domestic apparel industry, and can also reduce the amount of dumping of imported goods. The latter can enable civil servants to stop buying imported goods, blocking loopholes. This will not only expand the sales force of domestic goods in the future, but also block the dykes from our country's economic and financial resources flowing abroad. I also hope that the government authorities, domestic goods manufacturers, and fellow students will jointly review it.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Technique <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Technique is a basic quality of art. If art lacks technique, it cannot be art. For example, in the narration of a very ordinary story, those who are good at art can use very ordinary words to narrate it in a way that makes people laugh, cry, get excited, or even sympathize, so that any reader, when reading this story, seems to be experiencing it personally, witnessing everything, or even feeling like they have become one of the protagonists in the story, so closely related to their pain and joy. This is the narrator's skill in using his narrative techniques. On the other hand, those who are not good at technique, even though the paper is full of embroidered words that are arranged in pairs and sound harmonious, will ultimately only make the reader feel like they are reading a narrative text of a story.</p>
<p>Painting is also the same. Painters who are skilled in technique can use a few strokes and a simple structure to form a picture that can attract the eyes of the reader and is even more fascinating. Photography is also the same. Only those who can increase the quality and reduce the quantity can include the technical qualities inherent in their art in their products. I once read a notebook by a certain old man and saw a record of a fortune teller. Someone picked the word "fish" to ask about their fortune in life. He saw someone passing by carrying water and said, "Like a fish in water." Another person saw it and also pointed to the word "fish" to ask about good and bad luck. He saw a cat on the opposite house and shook his head, saying, "The mouth of the cat is a disaster." Someone picked the word "pagoda," and he said, "Step by step, you will rise higher." Another person also pointed to this "pagoda" to ask for a fortune, and he said, "The position you are standing in is opposite to the pagoda, so the lower you go, the narrower it becomes - a complete mess." This fortune teller can be said to have won people over with his skill.</p>
<p>Another example is playing cards. Although it is one of the leisurely occupations, card players cannot lack skill. With the same deck of cards, those who are skilled in technique can play a card and wait for three or even four calls. Those who are not skilled in technique will finish after waiting for two calls. Cook Ding always makes dishes with the same flavor, but housewives can make one or two new dishes, showing their unique cooking skills.</p>
<p>Some people say that skill is evolved from experience. I think skill is the crystallization of talent. Therefore, only those who have the talent to be a person can have the skill to deal with the world and gain a position; otherwise, no matter how hard you try, you will always work hard and not be able to please others.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Chatting with Gu Chuanjie About Kun Opera <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>Gu Chuanjie, a famous young actor of Kun Opera who was extremely praised by the general public in Shanghai seven or eight years ago, is no longer living the life on the red carpet. We can find him at Jinling University in the capital, and, strangely enough, he is not only not studying in the drama department, but he is not in the liberal arts at all, but in agricultural science. According to several of our friends who are relatively close to him, he does have the ambition to go to the countryside and work hard.</p>
<p>Half a month ago, I met him again at the clinic of my old friend Dr. Chen Cunren. He did not come from Nanjing to see a doctor on purpose. In fact, there was another reason; this reason cannot be revealed temporarily, but it is roughly related to Mr. Xiong Shiyi's production of the play "Romance of the West Chamber" in the UK and the US.</p>
<p>We chatted casually for a while and unknowingly talked about Kun Opera again. Kun Opera has become an abandoned art form in the current art scene. What is the reason for this? According to Gu Chuanjie's criticism:</p>
<p>There is no organized promotion and advocacy;</p>
<p>Kun Opera practitioners and general amateurs are too old-fashioned in their thinking and do not know how to be progressive.</p>
<p>These three points are indeed the fatal flaws of Kun Opera. Even I often feel that Kun Opera is actually not difficult and is very interesting, but why can't it occupy a considerable position in the theater world? It is truly an incredible strange thing. After we discussed with Mr. Gu Chuanjie again and again that day, we both believed that Kun Opera does have the need to be preserved and promoted. First of all, everyone should change the saying of "too sophisticated to be popular," and know that although the lyrics of Kunqu Opera are more profound, the performers always sing and act at the same time. The audience does not need to fully understand its lyrics, and they can get an idea of it from the actors' expressions; moreover, the dialogues in Kun Opera are extremely clear and easy to understand, and are no different from Peking Opera. Mr. Gu believes that if efforts can be made in the following points in the future: distributing brochures during performances, paying attention to improving the scenery and props, and training new talents, then it will not be a difficult task to revive Kun Opera.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu also believes that in the eyes of Europeans and Americans, Kun Opera is more welcome than Peking Opera, but when Mr. Mei Lanfang performed several plays when he went abroad, "Assassinating the Tiger" was indeed the most highly praised, which is a clear proof.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Interesting Talk about Hall Names <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>In the past, those who loved elegance and culture, whenever they built a room or set up a store, would always ask famous public figures to write plaques for them, considering it an honor. Therefore, there were many kinds of names such as pavilions, buildings, halls, rooms, residences, gardens, huts, pavilions, houses, studios, and inns, which were too numerous to count. If the plaques were well-written, there were certainly not a few of them in ancient and modern times. Now, let's just talk about a few interesting ones:</p>
<p>Someone wrote a plaque for a mediocre doctor's hall, calling it "Mingyuan Hall." When asked why, he replied: "Haven't you read the Analects? It says: '...not acting is called clarity...not acting is called distance.' In this way, 'Mingyuan' means not acting, not acting."</p>
<p>Also, a servant became rich and built a large residence, asking a celebrity to write a plaque, which was written with the three characters "Danbai Hall." When asked about the meaning, he said: "A young actress always calls herself a slave. The meaning of 'Danbai' comes from this (seen in Xiaolin)."</p>
<p>There was also someone who named a tavern "Zhe Zhe Ju," telling people, "I take the meaning of pleasing those who are near and attracting those who are far away." It can be said that it has a special idea.</p>
<p>One person started his career as a blacksmith, and his brother was a tanner. After getting rich, each built a residence, asking celebrities to write plaques to hide their humble origins. A celebrity wrote a plaque for his brother, saying "Eryou Hall;" and a plaque for his younger brother, saying "Jiayi Hall." The two were overjoyed and hung them in the middle hall. Little did they know that looking at "Eryou" directly, it looked like the anvil used by blacksmiths; looking at "Eryou" horizontally, it was like bellows. As for the character "Jia," it looked like the steel cone used by tanners, and the character "Yi" looked like a leather knife. They all used pictographic words to fool these brothers (also seen in Xiaolin).</p>

<p>Chapter Two: Fragrant Grass and Beautiful Women Trust to the Waves / Moonlight Night in a Small Building, Good Dreams are Just Beginning</p>
<p>Speaking of this girl, she kept turning her head back. Was she really looking at people? But she made it clear that she had other feelings. She sighed and said to her sister-in-law: There are a lot of wild graves in the mountains, I'm afraid the buried people aren't the right kind. If I die, I will entrust the two of you, my sisters-in-law, to bury me here. Maybe I can be worthy of this piece of land. An older young woman laughed: Menglan, why are you always saying such depressing things these days? Menglan said: It's not depressing at all. Everyone dies once, and can they avoid being buried in the ground after death? This Yuhuatai buried Fang Xiaoru, a great loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty. If we die, burying us next to the grave of a great loyal minister is also a great honor. A younger young woman said: That's true, but if you really have that day, it will be when you are seventy or eighty years old, with children and grandchildren all around, and then we will carry you up the mountain. Menglan immediately walked faster and left them, covering her ears with both hands. The two young women behind her laughed and followed, constantly calling out: Walk slower! We won't say anything about you anymore. After getting off the mountain, Menglan's sorrow did not diminish, making the two sisters-in-law inconvenient to say anything more. Fortunately, she was always worried, so the two sisters-in-law didn't mind. It turned out that this Miss Menglan's surname was Jiang, and she was the daughter of a wealthy family in this city. She was eighteen years old this year and was studying at Zhenkun Girls' Middle School in the west of the city. Today is Sunday, and something unspeakable happened at home. Her mother, Mrs. Jiang, said to her two daughters-in-law that the weather was very good, so take Menglan out to play. Unexpectedly, they ran into Zhang Guoqi again when they went to Yuhuatai, which made her feel even more bitter. After returning home, she didn't say anything and went straight back to the small building where she lived. The houses in Nanjing's mansions have always followed one after another, and can directly connect to seven or eight levels. Menglan's house has a total of six levels. A small building was built on the second level from the end. Behind the building, there is a small courtyard with a rose trellis, two or three trees, seven or eight banana trees, and small potted plants and Taihu stones dotted around, which can be considered a garden. On the right side of the courtyard is a whitewashed wall. Outside the wall, it is close to other people's vegetable gardens. There are two old willow trees that are several decades old, rising high into the air. Menglan sat upstairs, with a desk facing the window, and she always loved to stare at these two tall willows in a daze. This day, when she returned home, she went upstairs, washed her face, and sat down by the desk, wanting to find a book to calm her mind. At this moment, the maid Wu Ma came in with a teapot and a paper roll. When Menglan saw it, her face immediately lit up with a smile, and she took the paper roll in her hand. Then she quickly found a small knife in the oil and slowly and gently peeled open the paper, which was a book with very beautiful characters on it. On the other side were four words, which were "Double Star Magazine." (30)</p>

<p>The night before last, at ten o'clock, I boarded the Route 20 trolleybus parked at Jing'an Temple, wanting to return to Zhaofeng Park. The first-class carriages always have more empty seats, so I bought more first-class tickets. But that night was an exception, the first-class was already full of people, so I went into the third-class carriage, enjoying the two copper coins that were cheaper; moreover, there were only twenty-five people there, with many empty seats. But the first-class customers became more and more numerous, and those who arrived later had to stand. Naturally, their clothes and shoes were well-groomed, and they were undoubtedly people from the middle class and above.</p>
<p>But what is really puzzling is that the eyes of those standing people glanced at us third-class carriage passengers, a mere twenty-five of us, and then quickly retracted them. They didn't care about the many empty seats. Would they rather stand than sit in this cheap carriage with seats? Are they afraid of lowering their status or preventing their clothes and shoes from getting dirty?</p>

<h3 id="e217">Liu Dabai and Double Red Beans <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Red beans and men of letters, when a relationship occurs, apart from Wang Wei, styled Mojie, of the Tang Dynasty, Qian Qianyi, styled Muqi, of the late Ming Dynasty, and Hui Dong, styled Dingyu, of the early Qing Dynasty, the late poet Liu Dabai can be counted as one.</p>
<p>To speak of the relationship between Dabai and red beans, let's first talk about his life. In the anthology of poems edited by Zhu Ziqing in the "Anthology of New Chinese Literature," there is a passage:</p>
<p>Liu Dabai, named Jingyi, known by his courtesy name, was a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Deceased. He has "Old Dreams" (later re-edited as "Ning's Re-creation: Autumn's Shanghai Cloth-Selling Ballad"), "Postal Kisses." In the self-introduction to the printing of "Old Dreams," it is said: "His new traditional flavor is too strong, and this flavor is recurrently reappearing, not easy to eliminate." It also says: "He uses the pen too heavily, loves to say everything, and has little implication."</p>
<p>At the same time, in the "Elementary Chinese Textbooks for Middle Schools," there is also a passage in the author's short biography:</p>
<p>Liu Dabai (modern), a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, successively served as the Director of the Department of Chinese Literature at Fudan University in Shanghai, concurrently as the Director of Shiyan Middle School, Secretary of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province, Secretary-General of the National Zhejiang University, Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the National Government, and Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education. He is the author of "Old Dreams," "Postal Kisses," "Liao Ning"</p>
<p>(above are poetry collections), "New Talks on Old Poems," "White House Literary Talks," and other books.</p>
<p>I have written it out verbosely. Furthermore, Mr. Xia Mianzun sent me a "Short History of Chinese Celebrities" (?). Unfortunately, I lost it; otherwise, I could introduce it in more detail and arouse Dabai's interest in red beans. Because Zhou Gangzhi of Jiangyin sent him a pair of red beans (it was New Year's Day in 1924), and not long after, he wrote a prose piece called "Double Red Beans" (published in "New Talks on Old Poems"). In that article, there are three "Double Red Bean" poems, written delicately and touchingly, very lovely. However, after the double red beans, the issue of love arose. He gave the red beans to Wu Fuxia; in other words, he gave his love to Wu Fuxia. But Fuxia was not very passionate about Dabai. The main reason was that Dabai was poor and didn't know how to make money, so Fuxia said, "What I need, you cannot satisfy." This refers to both the economic and, of course, the spiritual aspects. Nevertheless, Dabai's passion increased greatly, which can be glimpsed in "Ode." "Ode" is a new-style poem with four stanzas, each beginning with "Xia is most worthy of being praised." Later, in Hangzhou, a rift developed between the two, which can be roughly seen in "Farewell," like "Spring returns in sickness, people have been apart for a long time, not for lovesickness, but also for lovesickness." "When does the letter arrive, when does the letter arrive?" "Is it a dream, why not, is it a dream, why not try?" It can be known Dabai's pain at that time. Later, Fuxia lived in Xiaoshan, sleeping in the arms of another man, not thinking of the elderly Dabai. When Dabai and Fuxia separated, Dabai was extremely painful. He said, "Tearing up old dreams, determined to tear up old dreams, seems to be constantly on my mind!"</p>
<p>Later, Dabai died. A certain lady went to Hangzhou to mourn and wail at the coffin. Dabai's family and friends did not know who she was. She claimed to have a deep love relationship with Dabai, had lived with him, and produced double red beans as proof. From this perspective, whether that certain lady was Wu Fuxia is still a mystery. If it was really Wu Fuxia, she had some conscience after all, not forgetting her past lover, wailing at the coffin. Unfortunately, the deceased is gone, how would he know that Xia, the one most worthy of his praise, came to mourn? Afterwards, who knows who will possess this pair of red beans?</p>
<p>Dabai was a sentimental person and also a poor scholar. It's a pity that a pair of red beans was entrusted to a woman who disliked poverty. Dabai wrote articles and poems for the sake of the red beans and gave them to his lover. However, his life was too painful.</p>
<p>In my humble compilation "Anthology of Red Beans," I included Dabai's "Double Red Beans" in the "Posthumous Works of Red Beans," and at the same time appended his high-achieving student Cao Juren's "Acacia Seed" and the "Red Beans" from "Metropolitan Scenery" in "Morning Post," so that the poets who have passed away may know something about their lives. Unexpectedly, ten years later, there is a fool who promotes and publishes them!</p>

<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation are often confused. In fact, although they are both venereal diseases, they have different pathologies, so the medication should also be different.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is due to the relaxation of the vas deferens. Premature ejaculation is due to sexual neurasthenia. Prescribe the right medicine. "Reproductive Element" is the main agent for both diseases, but for nocturnal emission, it is even more important to take "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" internally.</p>
<p>If both diseases are treated with electrotherapy at the same time, they can be quickly cured. Dr. Zhan Nianceng has the latest electrotherapy equipment. The surgery is also refined and skilled.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Neurasthenia <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The cause of this disease varies. All things such as masturbation, sexual indulgence, blood loss, poisoning, overwork, excessive smoking and drinking, postpartum disorders, weak endowment, and exposure to major accidents can cause it. It can also be divided into cerebral and spinal types. Its general symptoms include headache, brain swelling, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitation, constipation, and stomach upset. (The above belong to cerebral neurasthenia.) Fear of labor, fear of movement, cold limbs, body tremors, low back pain, and back pain. (The above belong to spinal neurasthenia.) Underdevelopment. Premature aging. Anemia. Qi deficiency. Mental depression. Muscle wasting, etc.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia is generally caused by the lack of endocrine secretion in the reproductive glands. Ordinary tonics and preparations cannot work. In addition to the implementation of appropriate electrotherapy, taking "Reproductive Element," a reproductive gland preparation, internally is the most effective. Please remember one example below.</p>
<p>The patient, Yao Zhiyun, has a weak endowment, is prone to worry and illness. Failure to take care of himself has led to even greater losses, coupled with stressful work and family burdens. Many stimulations have caused the nervous system to fall into a state of weakness. (Omission) Until last winter, he came to me for treatment. I diagnosed that Mr. Yao also suffered from nocturnal emission and stomach upset. In order to treat him quickly, I immediately instructed him to purchase "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets," "Stomach Strengthening Element," "Reproductive Element," and other famous medicines from the Chinese and Western pharmacies. He took the medicine according to the method for about four weeks. All the symptoms disappeared. The weakness was cured. He regained the strength he should have in his youth, which he had never had before.</p>

<p>— Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>The pathology of stomach pain has been detailed in previous issues of this publication. Radical treatment with medicine. There are also many medical examples. To put it briefly, the first thing is to treat the cause of the pain. Once the root of the pain is removed, then nourishing the weak stomach is still important.</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Qi Zhengdao, has suffered from stomach problems for many years. The pain occurs from time to time, causing him unbearable suffering. He has taken various medicines, all of which relieve the pain for a while. It's not that they are ineffective, but once the medicinal properties pass, the pain reappears. Therefore, the medicine is always with him, but the root of the pain is difficult to cure. This has been lingering until now. He regards it as an incurable disease. In early spring, he was introduced by Mr. Wang Mengchu, who had his foreskin circumcised at my place, to come for a diagnosis. After my examination, I instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Stomach Pain Reliever" from Taihe Pharmacy to remove the cause and root of the pain, and to take "Stomach Strengthening Element" to nourish his weak stomach. After taking four boxes in a row, he immediately felt his stomach strong and his body weak. He swept away the suffering of the past, he said.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which female physiology differs from that of men. Menstruation is the most obvious. If the female reproductive glands lack or malfunction in their endocrine secretion, it is easy to cause uterine diseases. Irregular menstruation is one of them.</p>
<p>Irregular menstruation varies greatly. It may be advanced too early, or delayed and continuous, or as much as menorrhagia, or as little as oligomenorrhea, or dark purple and clotted, or pale and sallow, or abdominal pain during menstruation, or uterine cold and menstrual cold. In severe cases, as a result of inflammation in various parts of the uterus, thick secretions are discharged, which is the so-called leukorrhea. The patient's abdomen is damp, itchy, and eroded. There is no way to be fertilized, let alone conceive. Women who have been married for a long time and are infertile are often caused by irregular menstruation and persistent leukorrhea. Therefore, they are listed as the main causes of infertility.</p>

<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Quitting smoking is not difficult. The difficulty lies in eliminating the pain and invigorating the spirit during the quitting period. I then have pain and mental fatigue. To seek safety and success is difficult.</p>
<p>There are many ways to quit smoking, such as sleeping pills, foaming, substitution, serum, denaturation, anti-toxin, blood drawing, and tonifying. Among the eight methods, the tonifying method is the safest. However, although there are many tonifying agents, "Reproductive Element," a reproductive gland preparation, is the most effective in taking care of weakness and quickly removing toxins and addiction.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking with Joint Pain</p>
<p>The patient, Shen Wenxian, came to see me last autumn. According to his report, he has suffered from joint pain for more than ten years. Medical treatment was ineffective, so he became addicted to smoking. In recent years, he has repeatedly decided to quit, but all have been abandoned halfway due to mental pain. Later, after seeing his roommate Shao Jun safely quit addiction, he came to me for treatment. I first instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Strong Stern's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to cure his bone pain. Once the bone pain was relieved, he took "Reproductive Element" to remove toxins and addiction. Not only was quitting smoking safe, but he also quickly regained a strength he had never had before.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking with Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia</p>
<p>The patient, Lu Liansheng, came to see me this spring, complaining of nocturnal emission and insomnia, which made it difficult to quit smoking completely. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission, and to take the holy drama "Reproductive Element," a tonic to quit smoking, to treat his weakness and break his smoking addiction. In less than a month, the problems were eliminated. He succeeded in quitting smoking safely.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Lessons from Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>(Mr. Song Mingyuan from Dasheng Nanhuo Store on Xijie Street, Quzhou, wrote a letter saying) I mistakenly masturbated when I was young. Until August last year, I suffered from nocturnal emission. After taking three boxes of "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets," the disease was cured. Because my body was too weak, I mistakenly purchased cheap tonics in the new year, which caused nocturnal emission again. I also mistakenly purchased four bottles of □□'s Sperm Consolidation Pills. After taking them, they were ineffective. Later, I resolutely specified to continue taking "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets," and it was completely cured. I am currently taking "Reproductive Element" to nourish the deficiency. My body is getting stronger day by day. It can be seen that although famous medicines are expensive, their efficacy is reliable. Mistakenly purchasing cheap and inferior medicines not only wastes money, but also misleads the disease.</p>

<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission, Quitting Smoking, and Brain Weakness Also Healed</p>
<p>Patient: Yu Bingyuan, 44 years old, from Chaozhou. Mr. Yu has suffered from brain weakness, coupled with masturbation in his youth, resulting in nocturnal emission and wet dreams. It often happens every month, which is very painful. The more severe the nocturnal emission, the worse the headache. Insomnia, forgetfulness, lower back pain, and back pain. Unable to do so, he listened to his friend's advice and tried smoking opium to alleviate it. After smoking several times, he became addicted to smoking. He repeatedly thought about quitting, but all failed due to the pain of the disease. Now, because the government strictly ordered him to quit smoking, punishable by extreme刑, it was difficult to procrastinate. He decided to seek treatment at my place three months ago. In addition to using the latest electrotherapy, I also instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Element" and "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" from Wuzhou Pharmacy. Not only can it treat his nocturnal emission and nourish his deficiency, but it can also eliminate smoking toxins and treat insomnia, forgetfulness, brain weakness, and kidney deficiency. More than a month after taking it, the smoking addiction was broken, and the symptoms have never appeared again. Now his body is strong, which he has never had before.</p>
<p>(2) Premature Ejaculation, Sexual Weakness, and Mental Fatigue</p>
<p>Patient: Wei Junchen, 43 years old, from Anhui. In the business world. Mr. Wei inherited three houses. Due to the bad traditional habits in our country, he married three wives, which led to premature ejaculation. His sexual ability is weak and his spirit is depressed. Lower back pain, back pain, dizziness, and blurred vision caused him a lot of suffering. He repeatedly sought medical treatment and took medicine, but all were ineffective. So he thought it was incurable. It has been delayed until now. In early spring, he came to Shanghai for business. Because I am more confident in treating venereal diseases, he came to me for treatment. In addition to using scientific surgery and electrical therapy, I also told him about health preservation methods. Because Mr. Wei could not stay in Shanghai for a long time, I instructed him to purchase half a dozen "Reproductive Element" from Wing On Company. Three times a day, two tablets each time. He returned to Anhui and took it according to the method. I received a letter from him last month, saying that it was obviously effective after taking it. He immediately felt full of marrow and thick essence, his waist and back were strong, and all the symptoms disappeared. Premature ejaculation has been fundamentally treated. I sincerely thank him for introducing the famous medicine.</p>

<p>Patient: He Ruilin, 29 years old, from Songjiang. In the business world. Mr. He did not cherish himself in his early years and indulged in wine and women, resulting in severe depletion. He also suffered from kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation. As a result, his reproductive ability was cut off, and all kinds of diseases occurred. The suffering was indescribable. Gradually, the more serious the disease became, the more painful it was. It was not until the end of last winter that he was introduced by his colleague Mr. Zhang to come to me for diagnosis and treatment. After I prescribed "Reproductive Element," the effect was remarkable. He immediately felt his kidneys strong, his body strong, and his strength strong. He took the medicine with peace of mind for more than a month. Kidney atrophy was cured. Premature ejaculation was also cured. The vitality was restored. He regained his youth.

Ten years ago, he was induced by bad friends and became addicted to masturbation. He wasted a lot of energy every day. Essence was exhausted and the brain was weak. The spirit was weak and the body was tired. It was difficult to concentrate on homework. Academic performance suddenly decreased. He knew the harm and painfully gave up. However, the youth glands had become weak. He was forgetful during the day and suffered from insomnia at night. As soon as he closed his eyes, he had many dreams. It seemed that the essence had been lost during the trance. He woke up feeling frustrated and his spirit was greatly depressed. He bought more than ten kinds of tonics and kidney-strengthening agents on his own, but they were not effective. As a result, the disease became more and more serious. The number of nocturnal emissions increased to more than ten times a month. He was exhausted and helpless. He came to me for diagnosis and treatment. In addition to applying electro waves, I also instructed him to take "Hymeto's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emission, and to use "Reproductive Element" to nourish his deficiencies. In more than a month, all the symptoms disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Teachers Starving and Unable to Endure Suicide <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Jianping</p>
<p>The education field is a "pure and poor" path, which everyone should admit. "Pure and poor" means that you can still live. At most, you won't get rich, but you won't starve to death. Therefore, many people think that entering the education field is "pure and noble." —— Those people who remember "noble" and forget the "bitter" dream still exist now. Unfortunately, things are not that simple. There are many things in this world that go wrong with people. Take the example of the education field. Now it has fallen to "distress." "Pure" is out of the question, and "living" seems not easy. The intermittent salary-demanding movements of teachers in various places are good iron proof. Perhaps, some people still think that salary-demanding movements are just "accidental" phenomena and do not believe that the bankruptcy of the education field is really like this. Then, please look at the recent tragedy in Xuzhou where teachers ran out of food, were unable to endure starvation, and committed suicide!</p>
<p>A telegram from Tongshan on May 28: Xuzhou education fees are bankrupt, and schools owe salaries for as long as eight months, leaving teachers without food. A teacher at Zuowa Elementary School, unable to endure starvation, suddenly committed suicide, triggering a salary-demanding movement among the entire education community.</p>
<p>The teacher's "sudden suicide" was because of "running out of food" and "unable to endure starvation." And these two reasons are determined by "education fees being bankrupt," which leads to "salaries being owed for eight months." From this, we can understand that this will never be an "accidental" thing. At the same time, we can say with certainty that the teacher at Zuowa Elementary School can "suddenly commit suicide" because he is "unable to endure starvation," and why can't other schools do the same? Even if they don't commit suicide, they will starve to death because they are "unable to endure starvation." I believe it is not uncommon. From this, we can also understand that the bankruptcy of the education field has reached a point that really exceeds the terminology of "pure and poor" —— and even "distress."</p>
<p>However, if we look at it from another perspective, expand our vision, we will think that such a tragedy is very ordinary and expected. Successive natural and man-made disasters, coupled with imperialist aggression, have bankrupted the entire Chinese economy. Because of famine, refugees are everywhere. Guanyin soil and tree bark have replaced all food. Starvation is commonplace. Suicide due to starvation is of course not uncommon. However, the so-called "not uncommon" does not mean "serves you right" or ignoring it. On the contrary, precisely because it is not uncommon, precisely because it is commonplace, we should consider it a serious problem.</p>
<p>The teacher's suicide due to starvation is because education fees are bankrupt, which is because the entire national economy is bankrupt. However, this entire economic bankruptcy is due to the continuous and multi-faceted aggression and exploitation by imperialism, and also due to the unsoundness of the entire economic structure. Therefore, from this tragedy, we should not only recognize the current situation of the education field's產, but also not forget the quyzhuang of this semi-colonial country. As for the method of making up for this defect, of course, only by targeting the root cause of this problem can we have the most correct countermeasure.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Traveling <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Xiangdong</p>
<p>During that summer vacation, I set out from home and arrived in Singapore, then transferred to a ship to come to Shanghai for the entrance examination. I took the "Conte Rosso" mail ship, which traveled at a speed of seven [days], crossing the Indian Ocean to reach Shanghai. Throughout this entire week-long voyage, I brought my mandolin to avoid loneliness. Thinking of the moonlit nights at sea, bathing in a kind of white light on the deck, quietly plucking the strings while the waves kept time, what a memorable scene it was.</p>
<p>After boarding the ship, I moved my luggage into the reserved second-class economy cabin, where I met an old man, at least fifty years old, whose graying hair and eyebrow wrinkles were clearly etched in my vision. He had already made his berth and nodded to me, revealing a kind smile. After a while, he approached me again and asked where I was going; because the "Conte Rosso" was first going to Hong Kong before heading to Shanghai. While taking out my daily necessities, I chatted with him; naturally, he learned all about where I was from and about going to Shanghai to take the university entrance exam.</p>
<p>"That's the best thing to do," he said. "Young people should study hard. My eldest son loved to study, but it's a pity he was sent to a tailor shop to be an apprentice at the age of fifteen. Of course, that's because I didn't have the money to provide for him. Later, he said he always resented me for not giving him more opportunities to seek knowledge, which is why he became a tailor. You are fortunate, young man. You must study hard in Shanghai."</p>
<p>What he said was entirely the words of an elder. I listened attentively, without answering him. He noticed my mandolin, reached out to pick it up and looked at it for a while, then curiously plucked it and said to me:</p>
<p>"What is this? Is it called a mandolin? You must love music very much."</p>
<p>"Yes." I nodded.</p>
<p>After the ship set sail, we were together every day, and we talked even more. He loved to listen to my mandolin: we sat together on the deck at the bow of the ship, the moon was full and round, and the sea was calm, truly a rare and beautiful night! So I began to play: playing, the sound of the mandolin, low and carrying a sense of melancholy, floated around the deck. I watched the old man, who half-closed his eyes, completely forgetting everything, letting the music of the mandolin intoxicate him. When my tune stopped and the air immediately returned to silence, he seemed to wake up suddenly from a dream, staring at my face with wide eyes, without saying a word for a long time.</p>
<p>But then, he shifted his body, "You play very well!" he said, tilting his head back, as if trying to find something from the moon, which made me feel that this old man was a bit strange. However, on another night, it was already past nine o'clock, still on that deck, the old man told me a story from his youth.</p>
<p>"Your mandolin has brought back too many memories; I am old and useless, but when I think of Simena, I feel comforted. She was a mixed-race girl commonly seen in Singapore; thirty years ago, we were in love. She played the mandolin very well; we sat together every day, singing songs. Later, her father forced her to marry an Englishman; since then, I have never seen her; nor have I received any news about her."</p>
<p>That's when I understood. The reason my mandolin evoked such sadness in this old man was because he had once had a love story...</p>
<p>He disembarked when the ship reached Hong Kong. He was from Taishan and was going to take a train to Guangzhou. We shook hands warmly at the Kowloon Pier, and the fine drizzle fell on our heads, adding a kind of indescribable sadness of parting.</p>
<p>"Studying is the most wonderful thing, go ahead!" he said to me, but his voice trembled a little. "My eldest son resents me for not giving him the opportunity to study... Study hard and diligently in Shanghai, don't waste your precious youth... Well, goodbye!"</p>
<p>Now, four years have passed, and I have not forgotten this journey. As for that old man, I know nothing about him—I wish him good health!</p>

<h3 id="e230">A Visit to Lida Chicken Farm <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) Lida Academy has a considerable history. It has not only made many contributions to social academics, but also made many elaborations on agricultural and pastoral undertakings.</p>
<p>Regarding agriculture and animal husbandry, in addition to a chicken farm in Jiangwan, it also has a horticultural farm and a rural service department in Nanxiang, as well as a bee farm in Songjiang and Jiaxing. Moreover, it also has considerable connections and relationships with agricultural colleges in various places.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in order to understand the situation of the farm's chicken farming business, I and Bingzhong made a special trip to visit it. At that time, we were sincerely entertained by Mr. Guo, the farm manager, and he explained everything in detail, so the impression gained was quite a lot.</p>
<p>The farm occupies a total area of ​​25 mu. In addition to more than a dozen wooden chicken coops, many fruit trees such as peach and apricot trees are planted, as well as milk vetch and vegetables. Peach and apricot trees can already be harvested. Milk vetch is used for bees to collect honey (because bees are also raised on the farm), while vegetables are all chicken feed. In addition, various flowers and miscellaneous trees are also planted. Therefore, this is not only a chicken farm, but also simply a very good horticultural farm.</p>
<p>There are currently six types of chickens here, namely: "Leghorn", "Rhode Island Red", Italian breed. "Barred Plymouth Rock", American breed. "Tiger Chicken", Turkish breed. "Hybrid", which is a cross between a Leghorn rooster and a Xiaoshan hen from our country. "Xiaoshan Chicken" is a pure Xiaoshan chicken that has not been mixed. There are about 300 chickens in total. Each strong rooster can mate with about ten hens, but because each rooster has a different physique, random mating is not allowed and they must be raised in separate groups. Each group has a chicken coop, the structure of which is just like a small house. The bottom of the house is about two or three feet above the ground to prevent moisture, and is covered with random straw, which is turned over every day and replaced every seven days. There is a chicken bed against the wall for roosting, with a manure drawer underneath, which is cleaned once a day. There are also divided chicken cabinets next to it, which are prepared for them to lay eggs. Each room has a water basin and a food trough.</p>
<p>After visiting the adult chicken coop, we went to the brooding room. The architecture there is different from the adult chicken coop. It is relatively tall—about the size of three rooms. Brooding inside is divided into five groups, namely, newly hatched and one week, two weeks, three weeks, and eight weeks. There is a stove in the three-week section, and there are also nanny thermometers in the one- and two-week sections; the temperature is about 90 to 100 [degrees]. There are statistical forms on the wall, which must be filled in according to the grid after daily inspection. People manage it day and night, but the food troughs and drinking fountains are specially made.</p>
<p>Chicks often need to bathe in sand, so each room has a sand basin for bathing.</p>
<p>It is said that the best chicken breed in China is Xiaoshan chicken from Zhejiang, and it is also strong, but it does not lay many eggs, and the eggshell is yellow. Although the Italian chicken is not as healthy as the Chinese chicken and is prone to disease, each hen can lay an average of about 300 eggs per year; they do not rest all year round and have no strong appetite, and the eggshell is pure white—originally, the yellow or white of the eggshell has nothing to do with the substance, but when sold, it is often suspected of being an ordinary chicken egg. However, if a Leghorn hen is crossed with a Xiaoshan rooster, it can become an Italian-type chicken with the physique of a Chinese chicken, combining both advantages. However, the first generation of hybrid chickens has slightly yellowish feathers and eggshells; it must be until the third generation that its feathers and eggshells can completely become like Leghorns, and its physique is of course the same as that of Chinese chickens.</p>
<p>The body weight of this kind of chicken is about five or six catties for hens and seven or eight catties for roosters. Each hen lays eggs for up to six years, and the mating of roosters is also only six years.</p>
<p>Turkish chickens are not raised for laying eggs, but are specifically for meat; it is said that their taste is very delicious. Hens are very small, but roosters weigh as much as twenty or thirty pounds each. Their shape is very scary. According to Mr. Guo, they can guard the night, and whenever they encounter strangers, they will definitely crow wildly.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Guo led us to his office—that was four rooms in a row, the middle one being the reception room, the one on the left being the office and a hatching room, and the one on the right being the feed room. The reception room was lined with many specimens and regulations of chicken breeds from various countries, and the hatching room had three hot water incubators and one table incubator. The hot water incubator can incubate 250 eggs at the same time each time, and the table incubator can incubate 50 eggs each time; this is completely done using scientific methods. Each time from the start of incubation to the hatching of the chickens takes three weeks, and the most suitable incubation period of the year is spring and autumn, because the climate is too cold or too hot at other times, so it is not suitable.</p>
<p>In terms of feed, barley, wheat bran, and corn flour are usually the main food, in addition to milk powder, bone meal, fish meal, meat meal, oyster shell powder, silkworm chrysalis, etc. As for chicks, chick powder feed and hatching powder feed are used separately, but vegetables and green grass are also essential daily food.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Guo said that they originally had more than 2,000 chickens before January 28th. The farm was later destroyed by the war, so these more than 2,000 chickens also sacrificed together in the artillery fire. Although the farm was immediately restored after the war; but a year ago, because the people managing the farm did not know how to do it, it has not yet recovered its former appearance. Mr. Guo was transferred here last year. He is now planning to distribute these chickens to the countryside for trial breeding to see the results. If there is no obstacle in breeding, they will prepare to universally improve and promote it.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to Mr. Guo, there are also five or six workers who specialize in managing chicken farming.</p>

<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>I saw Lao Feng again a week later on an evening at a public lecture hall.</p>
<p>He held my hand tightly, shaking it as if grabbing a relative. Then, we sat in a corner. Because there were still about thirty minutes before the meeting, we started talking. Naturally, I inquired about his week's life situation.</p>
<p>"I haven't done anything," he shook his head, saying with some emotion: "I don't want to do anything anymore!..."</p>
<p>Looking at that Barbusse-like profile, I was very surprised, why did he become so sentimental? Usually a happy, cheerful person who writes and talks, how could he say such words today? I couldn't help but ask him: "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"It's not that I don't want to do it anymore, do you know what my passion has earned me?"</p>
<p>Immediately, the faces of Bin and his other friends with satirical smiles appeared before my eyes. Those smiling faces were like bowstrings, forcefully shooting sharp arrows outward, each one hitting Lao Feng's weak heart. Feng, sitting next to me, his painful face, under the dim light, barely supported this pain, laughing with a low nasal tone.</p>
<p>What was placed before my face was truly an unparalleled problem, how could I comfort his pained heart?</p>
<p>"Don't be like this, you can continue to write well, the readers will not fail to appreciate your heart. They will definitely understand an author. You write well, even if there is no place to publish, it is good for us to read it. In fact, your life does not need稿費to maintain..."</p>
<p>The lecture was about to begin, so I had to stop talking. He was also silent.</p>
<p>When the meeting broke up, we parted hands. I advised him not to be discouraged. He shook my hand with great emotion and left. I also returned home.</p>
<p>It was not until three weeks later that I met him. But he had become even worse. He had become a person who only knew how to talk empty words. For example, when he saw me, he asked: "Have you learned the new writing system?" Then he said a lot about the advantages of the new writing system, etc. However, he was a person who had not learned the new writing system. Sometimes, he asked me if I had written any articles, and encouraged me, but his works were not only not completed, but he didn't even move his pen. He changed in people's indifference. Although that way of using a low nasal tone to laugh remained.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Mother <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Guang</p>
<p>When my father, who was smuggling salt, was beaten to death by the salt patrol, my mother, on a winter night, climbed into the Ma family's woods and hanged herself. She was rescued by the forest ranger and brought home, and she resumed the hard days that followed. The endless torment crushed this strong woman who grew up in the fields.</p>
<p>In that year, my eighteen-year-old brother, with a vague desire for revenge, joined the army. Since then, he disappeared like a shooting star, never to be heard from again. Relying on a strong body, my mother cranked the pulley day and night for others, watering the radishes or pumpkins in the vegetable plots. When the wheat ripened or the autumn harvest season came, when the sky showed a little gray and the chickens had not yet crowed, she quietly walked out of the village carrying a willow basket, to the small river, looking for the ford where livestock carts crossed the river during the day. She was not afraid of the cold, quiet river water after a night. She lightly stepped onto the opposite bank of the river, patrolling the fields, probing whether the watchman was already asleep in the straw nest. If she saw those guys who specialized in bullying poor old women like her, guarding the edge of the field with their drowsy eyes and carrying big sticks like bears, she would climb into the stone cave under the river embankment, peeking out from the broken sluice gate, waiting until the watchman had completed that circle and returned to the nest, his snoring rumbling. Then she would crouch like a mouse, working swiftly along the edge of the field.</p>
<p>In the summer, she would use a small, sharp sickle to cut some golden wheat ears. In the autumn, she would happily select and steal the red sorghum, the yellow foxtail millet ears, and the snow-like cotton... Sometimes, forgetting herself a little too much, the noise would alert the watchman. He would pick up his scary, thick stick and chase after her. At this point, if she could run away, she would risk her life to climb up the embankment and roll down like a large stone. When she dragged her muddy body to the south bank of the river, things would be considered calm.</p>
<p>Life flowed like an endless stream, and she grew older and older. During the harvest season, although she still had to steal some of the landlords' crops, she was often caught by the watchman. There was no second time. She was beaten or begged for mercy. Those fierce men like dogs snatched the basket away very simply, and angrily whipped the old woman, who was as thin as a bundle of firewood, several times, cursing a string of epithets and filthy words, and then whistled away.</p>
<p>At night, she limped home, dragging her beaten, swollen legs, and lay down on the bed, sighing one after another, cursing her son and her fate, until tears flowed from her dry old eyes. After a moment of silent rest, she sat up again, lit the small black magnetic oil lamp, the flame flickering, and she kept turning her right hand, the wooden crutch of the spinning wheel turning with her chicken-claw-like fingers. On her left hand, she held a strip of white cotton, sending it to the spindle one by one, the spinning wheel humming with the sound of the wind, softly, monotonously echoing in the small house. When the chickens in the yard crowed for a long time, and the sound of carts going to the market in the distance came from the village road, she sighed gloomily, finished the last cotton strip in her hand, put her hand down, yawned, rubbed the corners of her eyes, which were covered with large pieces of white sleep, with a pair of bony hands, lay down, pulled over the torn blue cloth quilt, and slept like a dog.</p>

<p>— Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Jinghong My bread just now was vitamin bread made by the nephew of the French bread king using the most scientific method; the beef I ate was made by the grandson of the German beef king, who personally cooked the nourishing holy product "Vitamin Chicken Juice Beef", so I am now so nourished that I speak big words (laughs after speaking)</p>
<p>Jingya Don't talk nonsense, where did these advertising adjectives come from?</p>
<p>Lihong If I don't say that, I'm afraid the passengers on the train will go to eat cheap and delicious British food because the beef noodles are not sanitary,</p>
<p>Jingya Isn't eating cheap and delicious British food much better than eating those sanitary beef breads?</p>
<p>Jinghong That's right, in this way, British food will become prosperous because of the way the advertisement is promoted, and conversely, the beef bread business will be ignored because of the attack of the rich ladies!</p>
<p>Lihong That's not necessarily true. People who eat big dishes always eat big dishes. People who eat beef bread will never change to eat big dishes because of publicity. This is based on each person's economic strength. It is by no means that advertising can dominate,</p>

<p>Dreaming of the Red Mansion, talking about the Wang family. Sister Feng is too frivolous. She is wanton and unrestrained, no one cares. Single-mindedly, she loves beauty, is greedy for money, and busy with schemes. Most ridiculous. Jia Rui has ideas and tries to take liberties. Repeatedly seduces, wanting Phoenix to seek Phoenix. Who knows Xifeng's heart is poisonous. So she called Rong to discuss with her second nephew. Everyone creates a poisonous prelude, a scheme of longing. Most regrettable, there is no public virtue and a lack of righteousness. Rui-ge is greedy for beauty and happy. In the evening, secretly enters the walled house. Stealthily waits for the door to open in the alley. How can the bone-chilling wind be resisted. Suddenly, he hears the window opening upstairs and his heart is happy. Initially unexpected, a torrent of foul water tastes foul. Jia Rui is, soaked all over. He is planning and running away in a panic. Annoying Jia Rong holds a torch and comes out. Grabbing him on the spot, wanting to send him to the officials. Jia Zhen comes out to mediate. Forcing him to write a promissory note. From then on, Rui-ge becomes sick. His mind is confused and he lies on the bed. So, he takes the life of the young lord in an instant.</p>
