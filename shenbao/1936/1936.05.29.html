<h3>巴黎一帶　冶金業大罷工</h3>
<p>要求提高現行工資　並實施四十工時制</p>
<p>（巴黎）　京城一帶各冶金廠、尤其是建造飛機汽車各廠工人、頃已舉行罷工、頃悉罷工工人所提出之要求、均爲關於職業之問題、例如　若干廠家工人以現行工資數額太少、要求提高、　實施每週四十小時工作制度、　京城一帶各工廠工人之工作合同、應由所屬工會代表與資方締結、以資劃一是也、一般人相信此次工潮、當可由勞資雙方商妥解决辦法而吿結束、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　京城一帶冶金業各廠工人舉行罷工、茲悉經過情形、係因十餘家工廠工人向廠方提出數項要求、未獲圓滿答復、爰自二十六日淸晨起實行罷工、當經廠方邀集罷工者代表進行洽商、結果當日午後大多數廠家工人業已獲得滿意、但尙有若干廠工人則仍停止工作而留廠未出、並聲言非俟獲得同樣結果之後、决不離廠、其中尤以伊西鎭紐波耳飛機廠暨聖王鎭拉伐萊脫電氣冶金廠工人堅持尤力、各該廠工人數百名竟留宿廠中、徹夜不去、迨至昨日晨間始與廠方進行談判、廠方表示工人所提數項要求、因須先與同業各廠成立諒解、始可照辦、一時不能遽予接受、無如工會方面鑒於若干廠工人業已獲得勝利、乃進一步擴大工潮、以冀貫澈原來主張、於是日內維里埃鎭葉名霍起基斯軍火廠（以製造機關槍著名）工人卽於昨晨實行怠工、惟至午後由廠方滿意答復之後、遂卽復工、大體言之、罷工工人雖多佔據廠屋、但其態度尙屬和平、故未肇事端、警察亦未與工人發生接觸、罷工工人均由其家屬暨同情工人之若干市政機關接濟飲食、未復工各廠之勞資雙方代表、本日仍當賡續談判、惟一般人以爲雙方若不能迅速成立妥協、則工潮將有蔓延可能云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英增加驅逐艦　美日均保留權利</h3>

<p>（倫敦）　日本對英覆文、提議保留超過倫敦海軍條約限額之驅逐艦四萬噸、昨已送達英外部、此間海軍觀察家認此覆文不得要領、蓋日本雖表示亦可保留超過條約限額之潛艇噸數、然未切實說明究將保留噸數幾何也、日本此種答案、無足使人驚異、因日本造成逾限潛艇、其注重潛艇較注重驅逐般與巡艦爲甚、此固早爲人所共知者、據此間當局估計、日本根據條約、應有潛艇五萬二千噸、但不久將有七萬二千噸、其超過條約限額之數約二萬噸、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美海軍部代理部長史丹德萊今日表示意見、謂英國若保留逾額驅逐艦噸數、則英國必須援引一九三〇年倫敦海約之「活動梯」條文云、英國根據非簽約國大增驅逐艦噸數之理由、乃亦增加其驅逐般力量、由十五萬噸至十九萬噸、超過條約限額、美海軍部大約將向國務院建議、以史德萊頃所發之意見爲對英態度、至於日本覆文、史德萊因尙未接到正式報吿、故不置批評、衆料美海軍部關於此事之報吿、日內卽將提交國務院、大旨謂美國在原則上不反對英國增厚其驅逐艦力量、但以條約嚴格解釋而言、英國應正式採用「活動梯」條文、聞美國對於外傳日本要求保留盟約應拆設之逾額潛艇噸數之答案、亦表示同樣意見、按倫敦海軍條約之「活動梯」條文規定、如任何簽約國以爲非簽約國之建造新艦碍及其國家安全、則可將其意見照會其他簽約國、增多其噸數、於是其他簽約國亦得按照比例而增多之、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>現在你們學習英語的機會與便利，比較二十幾年前我們在中學時代，眞不可以道里計了。現在你們有良好的敎本，有各種課外補充讀物，有完備的字典，更還有優良的敎師。這些機會與便利我們那時沒有，我們那時學文法，還得逐條背定義，這是多麽乏味而且無益的事。我們那　唸　本（這種讀本現在已經絕版）等於練習口頭翻譯。敎師上講堂，翻開讀本，就一句一句地譯爲中文，譯到下堂爲止。下次上堂時，他先令一二學生將前課照樣口譯數段，以後他就自己繼續譯下去。你們試想，我們那時的英文敎師豈可與你們現在的英文敎師同日而語？</p>
<p>現在從初中到高中畢業，一共有六年，每星期有五小時英文。學習的時閒，不可謂不長。要是你們能用心學習，到了高中畢業，英語的成績一定勝過我們中學畢業時幾倍。你們應該格外努力。但是現在初中高中學生的英文程度是否已滿人意，我們很生擬問。我有個親戚在高中　業，他有時來看我，我順便同他說幾句極普通的英語，他却瞠目不知所答，我有時翻開他的讀本，敎他讀一段給我聽聽，他的發音非常生硬，重音經音，簡直不分，十句我倒有九句不懂，這事頗使我驚訝。我想這或許是我的親戚資質欠佳，或者他在初中時英文根基薄弱，是個例外，不能一概而論。但是我又想到，像我親戚道類的中學生，其數恐怕也不在少，要是這句話是對的，那麽在學英語有各種方便的今日，他們的成績還是如此，這實在不能使人滿意了。</p>
<p>我想他們英語的成績不良，主因是學習的方法不對。關於英語的學習方法很多，現在祇能將基本的方法與你們約略說一說。這些方法你們的敎師一定同你們說過，我本來可以不必多講，但是我深恐你們在熟讀成語，默記生字，和分析句子時，將它們置之腦後不去運用，所以今天特別提出來講一講，我要說的　是學習英語的方法，　是英文的發音。</p>
<p>學習英語的方法</p>
<p>學習可分二種：一是科學的，一是藝術的。科學的學習大部分基於思想與實騐；藝術的學習大部分基於筋肉的訓練與技巧。英語之學習即屬於　術的，因爲它專靠口，耳，眼，與手的訓練。根據外國語言家的研究，學習語言有一定不移的方法，兒童開始學習外國語必須依照此法，方能收效。學英語的方法大別有三，述之如下：</p>
<p>耳的訓練Ear　training</p>
<p>口頭模傲Oral　Imitation和熟練Mechanizing</p>
<p>造句模傲Composition　bg　analogy待我分別說之。</p>
<p>學習英語第一靠我們兩隻耳朶，要是耳朵有了毛病，英語一定學不好。所以初中第一個學期開始一二個月的英語完全注重耳的訓練。學生初學英語，除開有時候觀察敎師嘴舌的動作外，用眼睛的地方甚少。在這個階段，學生先要能够「聽音會意」，繼要能够「聽音辨音」；對於英語敎學法硏究有素的張士一先生一向這樣提倡。我們要說一個字先須聽淸楚這個宇的發音。要學一句英語，先須聽淸楚這句話，這是一個顚撲不破的原則。所謂直接敎授法，就是根據這個原則。以前敎英文最大的錯誤就是開始敎學生去識字拼字，去閱讀造句，而不先敎學生用耳朶去聽，結果當然不好。要而言之，敎師在課程堂內應該對學生儘量說簡單的英語，學生不懂，可以利用實物，圖畫或動作來達意，如果實物圖畫動作都難以達意，偶爾也不妨用中文，但是用得愈少愈好。不但在敎室內應當如此，即在敎室之外，亦應當對學生常說英文，這是訓練耳朶最好不過的方法。你們做學生的應該知道耳朶訓練之重要，在課堂內就當留心聽英文敎員的發音，時常當加以練習。發音自然會日日　步起來。譬如　He　came.He　comeg　Has　he　come　　　He　has　not　Did　be　come　　　He　didn＇t　come.　Docs　come　　　He　doe　＇t　come.等句法，眼看一目了然，容易得很。其實當塲要說起來，便常要弄錯。這是非多總多說不能到純熟之境的，其他英文上各種成語和句法，都非如此練習不可。這是第一個方法。</p>
<p>學習語言第二個方法，就是口頭模傲。我們知道兒童很早就會模傲大人的說話，可見咿啞學語是兒童的本能。學英語一大部分也在乎模傲，模傲得愈多，芙文也就愈高人一等。耳聽與口頭模傲好比車的兩輪，是相輔而行的。我們聽了敎師講一句英文，便須模傲一句。自己冉常常加以練習，自然不會忘記而能到純熟的地步。聲如帶消極意義的句子，我們常聽敎師說Don＇t………，表示要去做什麽，常聽敎師用Let＇s……我們聽了就應該時常去模傲。不過口頭模傲最要緊的還不在字眼的用法，而在語法上的輕重疾徐。這父可謂「聲調」，英文是Intonation。要是英語的輕重疾徐不對，即使文法不錯，說來亦不入耳。現在一般編英文敎本的人，對於發音都已採用萬國音標，但是對於Intonation　還很少人注意，這不能不說是個缺陷。對Intonation　我還有一個意見，中學的敎師應該趕快採用英語留聲機片。據我所知道的而論，敎英語用的留聲機片，有三種：（一）林語堂先生編和D.Jones發音的（開明書店），（二）Palmer編製的（日本文部省英語硏究所），（三）中華書局編製的。其中以Palmer編製的爲最好最完備。英文上許多語法：如Asif　as　tbough　not　at　all　never　mind，thankstbank　you　so　much，Wbat　next，I　wonder！Ithink　so　too　I　do　bope　yon　can　come　Tbere＇ssome　thing　I　want　to　know！　Is　there　some　thing　to　drink　　I　hope　you＇ve　got　some　moneyon　you　I　haven＇等不勝枚舉，說來有輕有重，有疾有徐，敎師一面可令學生口頭模傲，一面常常使他們聽英語留聲機片，不但可以引起他們說英語的與趣，而且可以使他們樂於去模傲，練習日久，自能純熟，說起來可以脫口而出，不必預先去想。我們知道一側會彈鋼琴的人，一面彈曲子一面又能和朋友說話，這就表示他彈琴的技術已經純熟了。英語要說得熟，也要這樣。這是第二個方法。</p>

<h3>冀察問題　尚待曳光彈商淡</h3>
<p>宋哲元候晤田代皖　德王派員弟到津接治北平通信、冀察政務委員會委員長宋哲元、由津返平後、適値華北走私猖獗。日方增兵開到之時、關於冀察局勢之將來、各方均極注意、允其是</p>
<p>外交方面一時不易進展、聞當局預擬於下月初、與日方負責人松室孝良、繼續商談、新任日駐屯軍司令官田代到任後、曾召集幕僚會議、討論對華北政策、本月底當可來平訪宋哲元、除爲普通應酬外、對外交問題、或在便中交換意見、宋因候田代、原擬出巡之期、從而展緩、聞當局對外交問題意態、如日方能誠意來商、當然樂謀解决、吾則雖嘵舌亦無補於事、不如聽其自然而已、</p>
<p>冀察內部宋委員長近有充實計劃、連日幹部人員隨時集談、至冀察綏靖公署總參議石敬亭免職後所遺總參議職，已由二十九軍參謀長張樾亭兼任、故現局一般情形、大體尙屬良好、不致有何變故、</p>

<h3>走私活躍中　膠海關之損失</h3>
<p>自去年八月迄今　損失達一千萬元靑島通訊、自華北走私問題發生後、我國關稅所受之損失、異常重大、在膠海關一區、損失竟達一千萬元之鉅、據海關方面消息、在二十四年八月以前、華北一帶之走私、係屬偷稅性質、（如被海關查覺、即有被扣留罰辦之危險、）故不甚注意、自海關在冀東緝私工作、受某方之千涉後、走私船隻在海上臺無畏欋、在陸上又有武裝私運團體之組織、公然抗納關稅、致華北走私、日形猖獗、國稅損失如此嚴重、惟現在華北走私、完全屬於抗稅性質、只可行於冀東之特殊地帶、尙未延及膠海關區、然間接所受之國稅損失、自去年八月起迄今、已將近一千萬元、茲將各主要進口貨項目、所受之損失、分誌如次、</p>
<p>人造絲人造絲一項、銷於山東之周村濰縣一帶者、年約五百萬磅、（合五十萬小包）由靑島納稅進口者、的佔半數、每月可收入二十餘萬元、主要進口商入爲日華絲廠、在去年八月前、平均每月可到貨二十餘萬磅、因華北走私影響、私貨源源由天津濟南運銷周村濰縣等處、日華絲廠刻已被迫停業者、對此項稅收、自去年八月至本年四月終損失的二百萬元、</p>
<p>白糖在去年八月以前、由靑島納稅進口者、平均每月的三萬包、（每包重八十一公斤）行銷於膠濟隴海沿綫各處、（每包的納稅十五元）主要進口商人爲三井洋行、自去年九月起、已停止進貨、稅收損失約五百萬元、</p>
<p>烟捲紙烟捲紙一項、關稅高過成本數倍、又有統稅局進口護照之限制、以前進口者、多屬走私貨物、海關方面無準確之統計、而因此决華北走私之影響、國稅損失約在一百萬元以上、</p>
<p>其他疋頭類及其他一切高稅貨品、因成本太大、銷路不廣、牟利又薄、冀東一帶、雖有大量私貨輸入、尙未傾銷至膠東一帶、而魯西及河南各處、已停止由靑島購貨、海關進口稅收、亦受極大之損失、的計在一百萬元以上、總計上述各項損失、已將近一千萬元、將來情形如何、尙難逆料、海關方面雖嚴密查禁、力謀制止、但牽制頗多、收效亦屬甚微、</p>

<h3>上海之油漆業（再續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之廿六）</p>
<p>油漆之市價　油漆市價最爲平穩，歷年來無甚更動，惟此乃表面現象，按諸實際，則殊不盡然。蓋各廠批價，咸以折扣爲仲縮，其先批價爲九折，現多减至八折，亦有跌折至七五者，胥視其出品銷路以爲斷。目前批價頗有參差，振華，永固，開林，三公司前曾集議統一市價辦法，但以意見相左，卒歸泡影。近來油漆重要原料之桐油，其價飛漲，油漆成本抬高，各廠紛謀漲價，而外貨則已普加一成至二成不等。以現値論，外貨較國貨的高十分之三。茲將最近市價摘要如直（以元豐公司出品爲標凖：</p>
<p>（註）一公斤日二·二〇四六磅，一公升日〇·二六四二介倫。</p>
<p>油漆廠之現狀　上海油漆廠家數寥落，歷年來之異動亦尙平穩，陸續停歇者僅有民十九年之華昌，二十年之蓉光，二十叫年之光華廠，迄目前爲止，全滬華商資本之油漆廠，有永固等七家，此外尙有平凉路二二○〇號之永光油漆廠。該廠係英商太古吉星洋行合辦，資本國幣五十萬元，成立於去歲六月，出品專供油漆太古輪船之用，故市上尙不多覯。外人在華之設油漆廠，實以此廠爲濫觴。滬戰之役，在戰區之各廠損失頗鉅，執該業牛耳之開林廠，亦大傷元氣，卒至去歲停頓，現祇局部開工。但油漆業在一般工業中，尙屬優勝者，近來仍有利潤可沽，故最近傳聞將有新廠出現，已歇之光華亦在籌備改組爲大昌油漆廠。該業現尙無同業公會之組織，以其現有家數尙</p>
<p>永固——成立於民國十七年，資木十二萬元，廠址在江灣路九〇〇號，現任董事長爲沈梵盦，董事陳詰芻，沈慈輝，陳决平，陳慶順，監察爲梁信秩，黎震東，經理陳廣順。出品有長城牌各種油漆，該廠邊遠各省之經銷處爲華昶公司，蘇浙皖區爲同仁和，華南各省爲旦士德公司，南洋羣島亦有去路。本埠麥根路之大華紅丹廠，係該廠附屬事業云。</p>
<p>開林——該廠為我國最早最大之油漆廠，為周元泰等發起，資本三十七萬五千元，設備完善，機件新頴。初設廠址於閘北寳山路，民八遷同濟路，十八年在江灣購地三十餘畝，建造廠房，不料規模粗具，即値一二八之役，老廠全部被燬，新屋雖能保全，但元氣已傷，更以種種關係，不得已於去歲宣告停頓，現由債權人　欵復業，然景況已非昔比。</p>
<p>萬里——成立於民二十一年十月，為雷天成等發起，廠址在斜土路四五七號，原始資本爲三萬元，去年增至六萬，實收爲叫萬八千元。現任董事長爲葉汲三，董事央澤光，章衛甫，吴星齋，周信三，方志威，監察爲胡伯陶，方文炳，經理吳蔭槐。出品爲帆船牌各種油漆，在業中稱後起之秀。營業尙佳。</p>
<p>振華——該廠成立於民國七年，資本二十萬元，廠址設閘北潭子灣，出品有飛虎牌各種油漆，現任董事長爲樂振葆，董事張蘭坪，何楳軒，趙竹林，劉星躍，沈覲舜，袁禮章，監察傳松年，王雲甫，經理奏竟威。該廠幷設營業</p>
<p>永華——該公司先前設在北平，十八年來滬招股，是年十一月即宜吿成立，資本五萬元，董事長張久香，經理汪泰經，設廠址於蘭坡路三三九號，發行所於漢口路兆福里，出品爲醒獅牌各種油漆。營業尙穩健。</p>
<p>元豐——成立於民國二十一年，廠址設斜士路八九八號，經理孫孟剛，出品爲　牌油漆，專製高貨，低檔出產頗少，發行所在愛多亞路一一七號。</p>
<p>光陸——該廠爲前萬里廠經理陸聯芳組織，去春方始成立。資本六萬元，廠址在南市康衢</p>
<p>補註：滬南康衢路柬首王家宅二六——三〇號之中國鉛丹製造廠，亦有紅丹出品，且爲各路局油漆廠。工部局電車公司。及各化學工業所樂用，該廠經理爲吳紀春先生，發行所設於小東門康家弄仁義坊二號。（完）</p>

<h3>小柳兒</h3>
<p>— 川麟</p>
<p>天還沒亮，小柳兒給媽媽叫醒了。屋子裏點着煤油燈，小米稀飯在鍋子裏咕嚕咕嚕的叫，那香味怪好聞的。爸爸在忙着張羅東西，他高大的黑影在土墻上晃來晃去，屋子裏死得一團糟。</p>
<p>小柳兒眼睛裏一亮，他心花兒開了起來。『怎麼？咱們這就要去了嗎？媽，天還沒光呢，』</p>
<p>打前天起媽已經告訴他說了，他們要往關外去，媽說關外是好地方，有瓦房子，有大米飯小麥饝饝吃，瓦屋子且不管他，想起那大米飯和麥饝饝，小柳兒就够樂了，他巴着眼等這一天，他剛才夢裏還在吃大米飯呢！</p>
<p>他骨碳的從土坑子上爬起來，把自家兒裏進那破夾襖裹，冷和疲乏早忘記了，小杏兒眞討厭，這個時候還夾着在媽媽手裏儘哭，哭什麼？叉不把你送到老虎窠裏去，他就不會這麼蠢。</p>
<p>忽忽地一家人圍着坑邊上喝着稀飯，今天稀飯燒得特別多，味兒也特別好，爸爸拉了三碗，媽媽兩碗，小柳兒也拉了三碗，爸爸今天速一眼都沒有瞪他，眞開心，肚子吃得飽飽兒的，又暖又舒服。</p>
<p>一古碌兒東西全裝在一副担子上，前面是行灶，鑊子鐵耙，破箱子，破籃兒，後面一隻大籮，裝着爸爸的襖子，零碎包裏，小柳兒就坐在這個籍裏，給爸爸擔着走，媽媽抱着小杏兒背後還抱着一個大包袱。爸爸臉是鐵靑的，媽媽也是那麼醒着鼻涕，小柳兒眞不耐煩，大人們老是那麼古怪，一些兒快樂都不知道·小杏兒又哭了，這寃家！</p>
<p>突然，他記起一個泥人兒忘記在坑角子上了。那眞了不得，險些兒把牠去了。他一溜烟的跑了進去把牠找出來，藏在荷包裹，爸爸已經在對他瞪眼了，</p>
<p>他們還有許多人要一齊去，現在還先得到前村去候人，小柳兒坐在大籮裏，爸爸的破褸子圍着他，不冷！儘管風是那麼的吹，籮子一聳一聳的，怪有趣！天色還沒大亮，灰濛濛的像下着霧，小柳兒回頭過去，自己家的草棚子一點一點的小下去，小柳不高興那草棚子，可是爸爸似乎捨不得的。前面遠遠的一脈山，山的那一邊大概就是關外吧？想起了關外的大米飯，小柳兒的屁股在底下卜東地跳了一下·</p>
<p>『小寃家，跟我安靜一些吧，這個時候還要來磨難，你老子，看我回頭揍你，』爸爸又在駡了，臉是鐵靑的·　大人們眞古怪！眞不通！</p>
<p>轟轟轟！轟轟轟！</p>
<p>小柳兒爬在板凳兒上，伏着窗子儘嚷：『媽，瞧啊，這火龍多快呀，你瞧那樹木倒過去了，那山在轉，險呀！我的媽！這大鐵橋！』</p>
<p>媽也瞪着眼在瞧，小杏兒咧着嘴，有些高興又有些害怕，爸低着頭在抽烟，老是照着那骯髒的地板，眞不通！突然他抬起頭，厲聲的駡起來：『再不閉嘴，看你老子打死你！你</p>
<p>車子裏的人眞多！那麼緊緊的擠着，地下有人，擱板上也有人，有的在扯眠鼾，有的嘮嘮叨叨的在說括，似一羣蜜蜂嗡嗡地叫，賣鷄子兄大饅頭的人擠來擠去！那香味兒鑽進小柳兒的肚子裹去，眞够他　，他想要，但是瞧一瞧爸咬着牙齒在瞪他，他咽一口涎沫，不敢說了。</p>
<p>他盼望早些到關外。</p>
<p>睡了又醒了。轟轟轟，火龍還是在飛，小柳兒沒想過關外是那麼遠。</p>
<p>天晚了，窗子外邊黑越越的像有鬼在奔，小柳兒有些怕不敢瞧，『快出關了』，有人在說，小柳兒樂起來，啾了那人一眼。那廂的門開了，走進一個又像洋鬼子叉像警察兵的人來，背後跟着兩個大兵——爸叫做『X洋佬』的。那個人小柳兒認得，他已來過幾决了，是來查票的。爸爸有一張，媽也有一張，小柳兒是小人有一張半票，杏兒沒有，因爲她是小丫頭坏子。</p>
<p>那人把票格登一剪，啾了他們一眼。那Ｘ洋偌同爸要些什麼，爸慌手慌脚的在口袋裏摸，摸了半天不會摸出來，媽脫氣脫氣的直望着他，那大兵刮撻的在他臉上打了一個臉巴子。小柳兒駭慌了，哇的一聲哭了出來，刮撻！巴掌打到他的臉上來了，打得他發暈，好容易爸摸了出來，那兩僩照了半犬，又還他了，回頭又要抄包裹，東西全給攪亂了。小柳兒的泥人兒一隻腿給弄斷了。他一陣心痛，想哭，瞧瞧那個高個子的大兵，又咽住了。媽媽等他們走了吐一大口氣，汗都出來了，小柳兒兀的不敢抬頭。過一會子那兩個Ｘ洋佬兵在那廂把一個人吵吵鬧鬧的扭了出去，小柳兒還在擦着剛才被打過的發紅的臉孔，不敢作聲　轟隆隆……似乎一座山向火龍倒下來一般，小柳兒駭了一跳，什麼東西從窗子外邊嘩拉拉越了過去，有人在嚷：『出了關了！』</p>
<p>小柳兒深深地嘆了一口氣。『這眞見他娘的鬼！』小柳兒的怨恨和憤怒全寄在這一句話裏了。什麼關外有瓦房子，有大米飯！一個個鬼！都是扯他娘的謊！這兒儘是雪，山頂像一個戴孝帽的老頭兒，草棚儘比家裏還不如，天氣冷得他子是發抖，手指兒快掉了似的，爸爸跟大夥兒人來來往往，不知幹什麼。臉孔像一個可怕的鬼、媽不時的哭着，小杏兒生病了，眞是活該，到這個鬼地方來挨命！</p>
<p>這天早上，小杏兒死了，媽媽哭着喊皇犬在墻壁上撞，爸爸破口大駡的跟她發脾氣，桌子都撞翻了，小柳兒被爸一窠子腿踢了出來，他坐在雪地裏發怔，天的上灰雲像扯開的風蓬似的從北方駛過來，北風和剪刀一般呼呼的刮着，對面那座山像一個惡人般釘着看他。在那山的背後，小柳兒想起了他的家鄉來了·</p>
<p>小心兒裏一陣酸，兩顆眼淚流了下來，流到衣領上，立地結冰了他，依舊凝視着，四周的雪白茫茫的沒有止境。</p>
<h3>星</h3>
<p>— 全衡</p>
<p>近來，生活得有點像颶風一樣。</p>
<p>我們用身上緊張着的每一絲筋肉，推動着風車呼呼地發響</p>
<p>工作叫人忘記了瞌睡，大夥兒在一起的時候，從沒一個人不經心地伸腰打個呵欠。白天，爲了生活，我們中間有幾個能得成天在外拋頭露面，要補償這工作上的不足，我們只有把這付重的擔子，捱到夜里，捱到昏黃的燈光下，安排在每具已經磨折了一天的骨頭架子上挑。</p>
<p>秀的眼睛紅着，是接連着一個多月沒有好好睡覺的緣故，漠水時常會從害着病的眼睛里淌下來，靜的豐廠的面頰也凹了下去，自然的成功了對小酒渦，畹比從前也憔悴得多了，工作　得她沉默着不說話；只有華，這一羣黨中頂小的一個，還是整天哩哩拉拉唱着歌，她的歌，就像一星燎原的火，熾烈着每個人底心。每個人底心是熾烈得多麼厲害啊！只要一想到我們常前的任務，只要一想到那個呼呼地轉動着的風車時，我們便不容許說出一個疲倦或是躱懶的字，咬緊着牙關才是咱們的本份。</p>
<p>我們是一羣從每隻黑暗的角落里飛出來的靑螢，我們各人都帶了一點微弱的光明想來照澈別人，也爲了這個原因，我們才大夥兒的集合攏來，我們相信千百顆的螢光會變成一粒火。但是，隨便在什麼地方，隨便在什麼時候，我們韶示給人家看的，畢竟還只是一羣無力的，搖搖欲墜的星星，我們</p>
<p>然而，有一天，這黑黑的天板上是會速無力的，搖搖欲嗽的小星都不許站住脚的，世界被魔手用滿天烏雲塗抹得像鍋底一樣了。</p>
<p>接連着幾個黃昏不看見畹的影子了，畹上那里去了呢？平常不論疾病，旁的事情，我們之間總有一個知道畹的消息的。于芹偷偷地上她敎課的學堂去問，回答是早幾天以前就離開了，那一天正是她離開我們的最後一天，靜用手電筒照着送她出大門的時候，還小心翼翼的可囑過來：「這兩天風很大。畹，出門走路，領頭千萬要拉拉高，紐子要扣得緊啊！」畹用堅毅的眼光對大家掃射了一下，她點着頭叫大家放心</p>
<p>這銳利的西北風把畹抓去得太突兀又太意料中了，當淑華從老遠的地方跑來肯定地說出畹的去處後，每個人的眼睛里都噴出火樣的光，我們憤怒！我們呌囂！我們要用滿腔子的心火來燒掉這世界，毀滅掉這</p>
<p>同時，像一塊石頭壓在心上似地，我們時刻謹防着巨手的來臨。</p>
<p>年輕的華也乖乖的停止了她底歌聲，她握緊了拳頭說要跟人家拼命；我們大家都這樣覺得，爲了我們失去的朋友畹，爲了別人，也爲了我們自己，我們除了更努力地推動着風車外便沒有第二條路！</p>
<p>『回頭？回頭就是死路！』不時用的這樣一句話來警惕着自己！</p>
<p>夜晚，我們雖然依舊擠在昏黃的燈光下，但是失去了一個畹，空氣就靜穆得有點異樣，窗外面的一綫月光或是一絲風聲常常會被我們疑作是什麼東西而驚奇地放下了手里的事情</p>
<p>只有腔子里的心是始終急劇地跳動着，心與心之間牢牢地穿着一根畏的繩。</p>
<p>可是烏雲肯心甘情願的讓星星發着光麼？（縱然那光是微弱得可憐的）厄運終于步着畹的影子來了。先是秀，是在一個淸早給巨浪吞去的，跟着給浪潮捲去的還有秀的丈失明，（這一對年輕的小夥子的失去是多麼悲痛的事啊！）接着在我們那間小小的共問的屋子里又我不到了華。</p>
<p>一簇小的星星現在是分散開來了，那許多——我們那許多親蜜的伙伴們上那里去了呢？</p>
<p>散在各地的小星兒們啊！我沒有法子再可以把這些事寫得更詳細一點，我只能告訴你們畹和秀……她們和他們都變做了玻璃瓶里的靑螢。</p>
<p>然而，當我們抬起頭來的時候，一羣無力的小星依舊頑强地在發着微弱的光，而且，我們相信，經過了若干時間，這光是會變做一粒爆發的火花的呀。</p>
<h3>都市某一角的速寫</h3>
<p>— 周之挺</p>
<p>電燈輝耀着燦爛的光芒，無綫電收音機一陣陣發出使人沈醉的音樂，像拍撫在嬰孩身上的母親的手，有些安適，有些沈迷。平坦的馬路上，來往着如梭似的汽車，霎時就從你眼前滑了過去，輪聲逐漸悠遠，悠遠，正如一縷縷的紗樣，往復着織進了站在電車站上候車人們的心。天空黑黝黝地蒙着一重黃暈。三月的夜風，吹得使人迷亂。</p>
<p>電車還未來，候車的人愈加多了，一字地站在車站上。</p>
<p>三四個乞丐來回往復着向這批人乞求，仲着髒黑的手，喃喃地說着：</p>
<p>「先生，討個銅板！」　聲音是那麼的銷沉，這種乞求，誰都不曾注意，誰都想着自己的心思。</p>
<p>乞丐們叉散懶地移動了脚步，換一個人乞求。</p>
<p>「先生，討個銅板！」</p>
<p>黃黃的臉色，沒有特異的表情，只伸着手等着一個銅子到手。誰都如此，搖了搖頭，表示不給錢的。——天天要趁車，天天要碰到乞丐，不能有這照例的佈施；倘乞丐不走，也就打個轉身，表示拒絕。</p>
<p>「先生，討個銅板！」</p>
<p>有個乞丐站在一位西裝少年面前，這麼說。</p>
<p>「討厭！——」西裝少年瞪了他「眼，隨即走了開去。因爲着西裝的不一定有閑錢；卽使有，誰都明白，一個銅子養不活一條命。</p>
<p>而那些乞丐，一次的空手縮回，依舊毫不灰心，依舊那麼的散懶，依舊那麼的銷沈，依舊不表示出怨尤，又慢呑呑地仲手到一位小姐的身邊。</p>
<p>「小姐，給我一個銅板！」</p>
<p>「啐！介齷齪格手，拏開！」</p>
<p>這時？站在小姐身邊的一位高貴的紳士，從袋中摸出一個銅子，丁的一聲拋在地上。</p>
<p>乞丐拾了去，又換了個等客。這麼來回往返的乞求，誰都不能引起感動，誰都不去理會，因爲這種乞丐，誰都看慣了</p>
<p>不，誰都忙碌，誰都惦記着自己的悲歡得失，誰都捉着自己的希求、雖然，夜啦！但袋子空空，肚子空空，還得試一試最後的辦法；雖然，夜啦！日間的疲勞，到此時應有個休息，但，還得去喝杯白乾，或是一杯咖啡，排遣心中的　積；雖然，夜啦！然而，夜更使人惆恨，夜更使人孤寂，破費幾元錢，買幾聲假笑，買一度顚在吧；雖然，夜啦！然而無路可走，還不如拚着命去孤注一擲。雖然，夜啦！然而，有爵士的音樂，有輝煌的電燈，人也就興奮起來，生命是有限的，狂歡吧，忘却自己，忘却——切。雖然，夜啦！——誰部惦記着自己的悲歡得失，誰都這捉着自己的希求，無暇去顧及這些乞丐了！</p>
<p>「怎的電車還不來！」大家都昂首舉踵的盼望，願現出十分的焦急。</p>
<p>「先生，討個銅板！」</p>
<p>這散懶的呼聲太渺小了，霎時就沈入都市聲流的底里。可是，乞丐們也看慣了都市人的面孔，——嫌惡，不屑，冷笑，鄙夷，……這有什麼！都市人也有對眼請，可是，都市太繁華了，使大家眼花撩亂，看不淸醜惡與貧窮；都山人也有個心，可是都市太緊張了，緊張的空氣，使大家忙亂，叉使大家迷糊。根本，誰都不知道明天的世界是怎樣的。怨不來天，怨不來人，怨不來自己</p>
<p>兩旁爲聳入雲的大厦，滿街的電燈，半空輝耀着美麗的電虹廣告，醉人的音樂，往來如織的汽車，……這種種，像一　錦被覆着一具腐屍。而那些乞丐，就是從這腐屍中爬出在錦被外邊的屍。</p>
<p>電車風馳電掣似的響着鈴聲駛到了站，車門口吐出一盡人，接着又呑進一羣等客，接着叉風馳電製的駛去了。</p>
<p>不久，車站上又等滿了人，乞丐叉來回往復着乞求，都市是永遠這麼地在動着的。</p>
<h3>摩女</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>小樓上的空氣是凄淸的：挨過了霧露的朝晨，挨過了艷陽的午天，挨過了黃昏的夕靄，也挨過了夜網的星河。小樓上的空氣是凄淸的：看着媚春飄去，看着夏天有一個毒辣的臉，看著花草在秋里枯敗，傷神，看著雪浪鞭聲那一切的物羣。小樓上的空氣是凄淸的：笑臉，魔術樣的輕擂——接待着庸俗的商人，接待着飽醉的漢子，噙着那無限希冀的也得要殷殷地接待吶！人，跟了狂瀾捲去，季候的風不時的轉動了，但這永恒的小樓上的空氣——幾時才能接受農曦的光明呢！</p>
<h3>猥褻謎語</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>文學上的猥褻問題；若干年來，談者已頗不乏其人，但都偏於小說方面。去年；馮夢龍的「童痴二弄　　山歌」發現，　使我們見到山歌中的猥褻性到了怎樣的程度。如「十六不　」等篇，在道學家看來，簡直是不堪入目。此盡已有傳經堂發行的顧頡剛校點本，在雜誌「太白」里，我曾經談到。現在祇想說一點關於猥褻謎語的話。</p>
<p>很有幾個月了，在一家舊密唐里發現了一冊淸初刻本的謎語集，題作一新刊時尚雅謎驚盡鏡」，遼西青藜閣梓，共兩卷，收謎語九十八則。輯者的叙名是陳眉公，這顯然是一種假托，因爲在合訂的「新酒令」「笑到底」兩種里，會兩見「大淸律」，「大淸天」</p>
<p>這兩卷書里，收的猥褻　　頗不少，有的也極見巧思。如謎而「一物生來三寸長，一頭有毛一頭光，放進去乾乾凈凈，拿出來含水帶漿」，猥褻得眞可觀，而謎底竟是「牙刷」。再如「一物生來五寸，頭光頸細堪誇。佳人一見便來抓，掀起羅裙就要。床上翻雲覆雨，聲音好似琵琶。算來眼見是　花，弄得成胎綫飛」。而謎底竟是「棉花槌。又有一謎面：「頭兒低，腰又起，雙手翻來翻去，搇搇又顚顚。水淋淋，聲嘖嘖，直待水出方纔歇」。謎底是什麼　？是洗衣」。最妙的是借男向女說的話　謎而：「阿姐！阿姐！掇掇腳起！一掇鐙吐，　在肉里！實際上說的是，耳環。這雖猥褻，但都是很貼切的，眞如馮夢龍所說:「文人可思，何所不有」，固無常於大雅。可是一般人在各方而表現着的「性一心理，也就可見了。</p>
<p>也有些稍「典雅」的。如「吹簫」的謎面：「嘴兒親，舌兒伸，雙手尖尖摟抱身。按着竅兒通口氣，嗚嗚咽咽作嬌聲」。如「香簡」的謎面：「玲瓏剔透內香。，伴子郞君被里存。動？火時容易洩，只因腹中掙一根」。還有「火筒」的謎面：「一若動火，便把腰樓，上頭親嘴，下頭着了」。這却要露骨一些。至於並不露骨，而更雅韻的，也有不少。事實上這一類的，是已經只能算是「私情謎面了。如以下的幾條：</p>
<p>相思病骨瘦如柴，若要　　轍底開。只因情人躭誤我，叫人提起淚盈顋。（右隱傘）</p>
<p>姊妹們最輕狂，穿紅着綠引才郞。苦了多少風流客，害了多少當家郞。（右隱骰子）</p>
<p>偶因一語（雨）蒙抬舉，反爲多情（晴）又別離。送得郞君歸去也，倚關獨自淚淋漓（右隱傘）</p>
<p>遍身體能軟如綿，常向江濱吐玉泉，三四勸奴奴不嫁，只因情（晴）久被郞牽。（右隱水車）</p>
<p>絛這些「私情謎面」，作的都極佳。同時從這兩卷謎語里，也可見當時人是頗歡拿和尚道十　開心的。往往用很村的話來說明地們。如隱「道冠」云覆着一條槽，僚着）宗毛，摸着這個孔，放進這一條」。如隱兩和尚兩頭睡云：「兩頭兩頭，中間兩頭；兩頭大，兩頭小；，兩頭破，兩頭好；兩頭光，兩頭草；兩頭堅，兩頭倒」。都是極惡劣的。就是「典雅」一點，似乎也祇能　到這樣：「　　燒夜香，紅娘姊將半枝香　在香几上。我只道張生跳粉牆，却原來是法聰和尚。一（右隱秃字）。與和尚道士有關的，還有願裏的「鐘」，也有一謎云坐弗安來睡弗寗，靠弗着來立弗稔，爲渠　動失子心。弗到撞了精光棍，一霎時間有了身。其間「身」「聲」同音。這樣却是做得好。</p>
<p>以上一些謎，寬泛點說，部可說是在猥褻範圍之內。特略記以見謎語中之猥褻性？其他也有流恢到現在，仍爲我們常常說到的。有些由於生活的差異，是早已消滅了。在當時人中？徐文長也很歡喜道十套「逸稿」第二十四卷，收的全是謎語，「佚草」里也有不少。有些和一鴛鴦鏡所收是相同的。不還沒有猥褻作，但謎面有作得極住的。用「如夢令」詞隱黃蜂，「燈毯」，「花燈」幾則尤好。這里只餘「傘一一則，以與「鴛鴦鏡」里的兩則傘相映證：</p>
<p>聞如輸　　如　，剪紙　　　親朋竹。月　中荷蓋影亭亭，雨里八角聲肃肃。晴天則陰陰而晴，二天之說減分明。安得大　居吾手，去覆東西南北之人行！</p>

<h3>日本諷刺文學胡勃起（下）</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>關於純文藝作家的陣營裏，對於諷刺文學大都是反對的。正宗白鳥是持反對論的，詩人萩原朔太郞（關於諷刺詩）也是持吾定論的。　正宗白鳥在起初是這樣地寫道：（「關於諷刺小說」）：「是諷刺小說應出世的時世了。在現在的世間，我不到讀了起共嗚的諷刺小說，我痛切地感到這是文壇缺少才能之士的一個例證。」</p>
<p>在這段引證裏，他是提倡諷刺文學的，但他是立脚在虛無主義的根基上，使諷刺有了虛無的人類輕蔑的意義。他在「諷刺文學」內說：「與斯威夫特同時代的琴啟迪遜，斯梯爾　Stel的諷刺，是種想改良禮節應酬的東西，莫利哀的「達爾周夫」（Tartufe），果戈理的「鼻」，那諷刺味是深刻的，歌洲文學史上正統的諷刺家魯細恩起，以至於拉甫萊，（Rabelais）席拉諾（Cyrano）等的諷刺，好像辛辣味很豐富，但我却獨選斯威夫特，因爲他沒有侮蔑怨恨人類。」實在白鳥氏是最喜愛斯威夫特的「在我勞作裏盡力最重的地方，是在煩惱世人（甚於安慰世人）」。所以他不注意於諷刺文學對於社會的意義。</p>
<p>至於萩原朔太朗，他說：「諷刺詩盛旺的時代，老是民眾的自由被束縛之專制的厭制政治時代。諷刺文學是在不能作正面抗爭時。在背後伸着舌頭，作着毒舌的「譏刺」。一種弱者的復　。亦就是無能為力者的「被束縛者的鼻腔」，日本江戶時代流行這種為學是當然的，而今日的時代裏，那轉向的新詩人之提倡諷刺詩也是當然的」。「但諷刺詩之類的文學，要言之，不是正軌的藝術，乃是種以輕盈的幽默與味為主的一種所謂「輕佻文學」。也就是像每天報上的漫畫，在一笑之後，就樂如紙屑般的東西。所謂真的嚴正意義上的「詩」，乃是愛倫坡）Alan　Poe）所說的抒情詩。」在這些話裏，我們可以知道他的抹殺諷刺詩乃至文學的全貌了。不用說，這是站在藝術至上主義者的立場上的詩人，所必說的話。</p>
<p>諷刺文學到底是種怎樣的東西呢？有怎樣的意義呢？作爲日本諷刺文學的擁護者的理論根據的，是盧那卡爾斯基「關於笑」的演講。　現在爲着說明「諷刺文學」的源泉起見，特節譯點他的卓越的意見如下：「……一笑呼起了這個被笑者的自己評價，第二嘲笑，在傍觀者看來認爲是正當的，對於想攻擊自己的敵方之嘲笑者的企圖，須喚起傍觀者的同感。……　「諷刺可以使笑成了有毒能刺人的東西……。」</p>
<p>「諷刺的笑針向着敵的神聖的戒律，向着在敵方作爲權威之物的時候，就有了大意義。……如此則笑的行動就成了力强的東西。甚之可以疑惑是吾還有其他的論理的武器，像這樣的諷刺的笑，不但顚覆了敵的方針，並且拆毀了一直以爲是神聖的東西。……</p>
<p>總之，以上是日本新的進步作家羣所提倡的諷刺文學的一個源泉。我們當然認爲這是最肯切的對於諷刺的認識；但我們在這裏却不敢贊成江口漁氏的說法，說進步文學因爲政治勢力而必須走上諷刺文學之道，這却中了恢原的否定說。要知道諷刺的精神，在我們東方乃至西歐的德國，是缺少這種精神的；我們由於太受了佛敎儒敎的影響，都正襟端步，裝着悟道的變熊；或者是不管浮世之事，兀自淸高，因此絕不能富有諷刺的精神。</p>
<p>至於有些作家（刪巧俱樂部諸人），認諷刺文學是進步文學的唯一道程，這也有商討的餘地。固然在這目前不安的時代；隨着進步文學的成長正是新人類的成長之產物的緣故，則進步文學仍舊用最技巧的方法，作正面的進軍，也不是不可以的；在道場會是不能抹殺諷刺文學）。我們看立野信之的「流」島木健作的「再建」諸作品時，更能悟到這一點。</p>

<h3>本校校務過去之回顧與今後之改進計劃</h3>
<p>— 韓覺民</p>
<p>今日爲本校楊校主逝世二十八週年紀念日，適値二十四年度將近終結之時，回憶本人接長校務以來，迄今一載有餘，每念故校主楊公毀家興學之盛德，輒覺對此偉大遺產之責任，有無限的慚愧和惶懼！現在又是廿五年度行將開始之日，特乘此機會，將過去年餘以來的校務概况，作一總的檢閱，以便確定今後改進的方針與計劃。還以十二分誠懇的敬意，希望社會人士給我們以嚴正的批評和指導！</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>本校創辦於前淸光緒三十一年，迄今已有二十二年的光榮歷史，又處在偉麗敦樸的環境中，所以形成了種種特有的習尚：</p>
<p>數理化之注重：楊校主原是一個富有經騐而缺乏學理基礎的工程師，當時創辦學校設立工業班，都是爲了提倡工業，培養工科人才，所以對於數理化特別注重，不獨數理化專任敎員皆爲國內名敎師，而且三十年來本校畢業生得益數理化而供職於實業界者，也特別的多，相沿成　，大多數的學生對數理化的興趣，都較其他學科濃厚。這裏面的原因，我想也許是因爲校內的理化設備此較完全，學生能在實騐室中去求興趣，不是苦記書本中的定理和公式；同時敎授法不是呆板式的灌溉，而是啟發式的誘導，也當然是一種重要的原因，</p>
<p>求學之興趣：本校處在農村社會中，自然沒有外界奢侈紛華的誘惑，擾攘呌囂的嘈雜聲浪；而校舍廣闊舒適，又遠過共他學校，所以學生求學進取的勇氣，也似乎特別一點，允其春夏兩季，每當淸晨東方將白的時候，我們就能聽到綠陰樹叢中鳥鳴雀躍的聲音，雜以學生讀書的聲音。此外像田野花草，淸香撲鼻，這一類大自然界的力量，推動學生讀書的興趣，我想也是不少的，所以本校就是愛好遊玩的學生，也似乎沒有不現出「惟有此間讀書樂」的樣子。</p>
<p>體育之普及：本校所處的環境已如上述，所以運動塲所也特別寬敞，不像人烟稠密的都市的學校，而體育設備也極完備，幾於應有盡有，所以每個學生在每日課餘後，都會自動的參加運動。不過這內面還有一最大原因，就是這裏的學生除了運動以外，沒有其他無聊娛樂之引誘，因此本校的體育榮譽，不獨尚能保持光大，而且各個學生體育的狀况也比較普及，不像都市學校的學生頗多文弱的習慣。</p>
<p>生活之勤樸：這自然是得力於楊校主提倡辦學的宗旨及歷來學校當局之砥礪施行。楊校主在宣佈學校宗旨書中說：「斯盛於學問慚愧一無所知，惟自少貧苦，半生役役於工業中所經騐者，知天下事無論爲個人謀自立，爲社會謀幸福，下手時非有堅忍刻苦工夫，必不能達其希望，……堅忍刻苦工夫吾謂其目有二：一曰勤，一曰樸。」所以動樸的校風，在本校學生生活中，也特別顯著。這確是楊校主偉大的人格所戚化，不過學生日常生活接近農工生活，也影響他們不小，所以大家都很以奢侈懶惰爲羞。</p>
<p>像以上所拉雜說來的各種習尚，自然是可以寳貴的校風，應該接受而加發揚光大起來；不過同時在這種環境當中，却於不知不覺的產生了兩點缺憾；</p>
<p>忽視了社會科學的重要性：因爲偏重數理化之結果，就對於社會科學，允其是史地，很多忽略，大部份的學生，不是認爲這種科學容易學習；就是認爲不足輕重，忽視了它的重要性這種情形自然不是本校所特有的，可以說是一般學校所共有的，不過我個人覺得本校似乎特別如此。</p>
<p>服裝不求整齊：服裝不求華美，當然是我們應當贊同的，不過邊幅不修似覺一種缺陷。這裏大部份的學生，都不大講求外形的美麗，只求舒適暢快，所以每當天氣稍暖之時，都歡喜着木展，可可噹噹，而在寒冬時候，則又歡喜着笨重不堪的草鞋，積久成習，很難禁絕。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>在過去一年多中，爲了保持固有的美德，矯正缺憾的現象，以及增進敎學效率，節省經費的支出。我們對於校務改進之處，的有幾點：</p>
<p>採取訓敎合一制：學校是一整個不可分割的有機體，學識之造就，屬於敎務的責任，人格之感化，屬於訓育的責任。這種分工合作的辦法，調整得宜，原可以收事半功倍之效；但每因權限不淸，或因權限過淸的關係，常常發生推諉的現象，影響訓敎甚大，所以自去年下季以來，我們决定採取訓敎合一制，歸併敎務訓育兩處爲敎導處。使訓育敎務發生密切的連繫，互相爲用，以推進訓敎效能，現在已有一年了，而從前彼此推諉阻礙訓敎實施的現象，雖不敢說完全絕跡，却較先前减得不少了。</p>
<p>採取導師制：每班聘專任敎員一人爲導師，常川駐校，一以應學生隨時問難之需，一則給敎員以訓導監督之權，以發揮訓敎合一之效能，關於導師權限，我們訂有導師規程。每月開導師聯席會議一次，討論訓導改進事宜，及向敎導處貢獻敎導意見。在這導師制試行之後，我們得到了訓育方面的輔助，也很有可觀。</p>
<p>史地敎學的改良：國內外刋行的史地敎材，雖是很多，然而要適合學生眞正需要的，確是很少，不是繁蕪　劣，故事艱深；就是患了形式上的編排和文字的重複乾枯，所以我們爲免除這種毫無興趣的感覺起見，過去一年特聘對史地有精博研究的敎師，自行編印講義。不獨文字生動有趣，並使史地發生聯繫，學生大都戚着容易領會記憶。</p>
<p>改訂學生缺課登記法：過去學生時有無故曠課之現象，我們爲防止無故缺課，自由請假起見，對於缺課曠課之登記，已施行嚴格辦法。卽由敎務課每日根據學程點名簿將缺席姓名摘出，對證訓育課請假簿，及訓育員巡視各敎室考察簿，每星期公佈一次，按照缺席懲罰辦法，嚴厲執行。自經實施後，缺席决數日見减少。</p>
<p>厲行新生活運動：因爲學生習尚儉樸的很多，同時也因此有失之於衣冠不整，允其是木展草鞋，頗礙觀瞻。一年來厲行新生活運動，所有各敎室寢室之整齊淸潔，很有進步。學生着木展草鞋進出辦公廳敎室膳堂者，差不多已是絕跡了。</p>
<p>合處辦公：爲節省經費和求辦事上之敏捷與時間上之經濟起見。我們已將校長室事務處敎導處合併爲總辦公室。各職員按時到室辦公，置有簽到簿，每日送由校長或敎導長考勤、</p>
<p>其他：因考核各項進度，特於公餘編繪各項統計比較圖表，幷爲增進學生的常識起見，每逢星期一，敦請名人蒞校演講。一年來學生對於文藝研究大有長足進展，按期出版者，現有「新路」「南烽」「紅光」「碎玉」「夔門」數種刋物</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>本校校務之改進，一年以還，雖不遺餘力，而且每經一决改革，卽歷若干時之討論與試行，然自問缺憾尚多。現爲充實內容，益臻完備起見，特於二十五年行將開始的今日，謹擬今後改進計劃於後：</p>
<p>改進的方針過去的敎育，對於學生畢業後的出路問題，是沒有計議到的，所以選修科目旣沒有從社會需要上去確定選修課材，使學生有就業的技能，也沒有考察高等敎育機關課程的改變，去介紹一般學術研究的門徑。本年校董會爲顧念學生畢業後出路問題，議决每屆畢業前五名不願升學者，得由校董會負責介紹工作。所以今後敎育方針，就在集中培養升學與就業兩種人才。（甲）關於升學凖備方面，一以必修科完成學生公民的資格，使身體精神上兩方面都獲得健全的發展；二以選修科介紹一般學術之門徑，以培養專門研究之興趣，使其能愉快地升入高等敎育機關。（乙）關於就業凖備方面一以必修科使學生在公民及一般生活之知能上得到根本的訓練；二以選修科培養職業上一二種特別技能，而爲將來謀生的工具·</p>
<p>敎務的計劃　本校過去敎學方案，側重數理，是以由代數大代數而微分積分及平幾立幾解幾之聯續敎學；又分授中等化學高等化學及普通物理高等物理。因此，學生知能在畢業升學之指數上，無形造成了百分之八十升入工科的最高紀錄。此種畸形發展，以我們現時敎育方針論，固然有點病態的象徵，不合現階段的敎育目的。所以爲免除這禮情形起見，此後敎學方案，數理化應與社會科學及職業技能並重。同時爲增進敎學效率起見，擬於下學期設立各學科敎學研究委員會。（甲）研究本門課程與其他課程分量輕重，以謀敎育之平衡發展。（乙）研究敎學方法及實施「做學敎」之方案。（丙）硏究生產敎育如何實施方案，以期適應國難期間特種敎育之目的</p>
<p>訓育的計劃訓　育的原則，是應根據靑年身心之平均發展，而注意到人格上之掏養及團體之生活，爲求達到此目的，我們以爲宜重指導規勸，而輕責罰。同時爲使學生明瞭團體生活之重要及其應有之義務與權能，决自下學期起，勵行軍事管理，以便養成團體生活應有的紀律和習慣·所以除原有各種訓育規的外，特增訂兩項實施辦法；（甲）積極的：　盯定獎勵辦法，鼓勵課外作業，以喚起學生的責任心與合作精神。　在作業室與自修室，由學生自動訂定各種公約，使其自動的共同遵守，並養成自信心與自動能力。（乙）消極的：犯過者，加倍使其在靑年服務團從事勞役的工作，使其能在勞動體騐中潛移默化　。</p>
<p>軍事管理之實施　在這第二决世界大戰的前夜，允其是當我們民族逼近了生死存亡的關頭，國民軍事訓練，已成爲我們目前最緊急的工作。本校自民國十四年卽已實施軍事訓練，惟對於軍事管理，迄未實施。擬自本年下學期，切實實施。使學生理解這團體生活與團體紀律之必耍，準備第二决世界大戰與民族解放鬥爭中之合理行動。</p>
<p>建築體育館　本校體育因爲環境的關係，久已斐聲遐邇。遠有造成全國長跑三千米的新紀錄，近又奪得各種球賽之錦標，惟因限於經濟，迄無體育館之設置。現經校董會决議，募捐建築體育館，而鍜鍊學生健全之體格。</p>
<p>增設免費生名額　現在世界經濟危機，日深一日，而我們自給自足的農村經濟，也瀕於破產。中產之家，已困於學費之繁重。本校爲救濟失學靑年起見，决自下年度起；設置免費生額，每班暫定一名。（共十二名）由評定成績名列第一者，於每學期終了時，公佈之。還另設半費生十二名，凡是成績操行均列甲等的前十二名，都得享受此種待遇</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>以上是我們關於本校過去的回顧及今後改進的計劃，因爲時間倉卒，自然難免掛漏不周之譏。人們常見富麗堂皇的文字，輒謂「說得好聽，」我們現在所說的恐怕在讀者的心中連這種印象也不能獲得。不過我們相信不在文辭之美，而在實行之艱。所以我們今日紀念楊校主逝世二十八週年之日，亦惟有盡力遵守楊校主「想到必做到」之遺訓，以求勿負這偉大的人物毀家興學之盛德，那末，我們的願望也就算達到了。</p>
<h3>浦東中學校史</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本校由浦東楊公斯盛創辦於淸光緒三十年，迄今已有三十二年之校史，茲値楊公逝世二十八週年紀念，特誌其</p>
<p>大者，以告社會人士，想亦國難聲中之所樂覩者也。先是，故校主楊公營別墅於上海蔓盤路，延聘當時有爲之士，如黃炎培，孟子詮，顧冰畦諸先生‘就別墅原有家塾改爲正式學校，定名廣明小學，此卽本校之權輿。光緒三十一年，楊公以學校逼近家庭，不便擴充，且立學於紛華靡曼之租界，允非敎導靑年學子之地，乃决捨十萬金購定浦東六里橋今校地四十餘畝，命名浦東中學，從事設計建築，並提銀六萬兩作爲基金。次年十月新校舍落成，刋布中學章程，翌年正月運入新校舍，開始招收中學生，將廣明小學併入中學，改名附屬高等小學，二月先校主宣布學校宗旨，以勤樸二字爲校訓，十一月大禮堂落成，高懸校訓於禮堂之正中央後方，以示來學。至光緒三十四年復增基金爲十二萬兩，附屬高小一所，初小二所，均另遷入新建校舍，而中學本部之規模遂愈益宏大矣。總訐此四年中建築，基金，設備，開辦等費，不下三十餘萬金，皆楊公一　所捐輸，辦理未久，而成續斐然，中外人士無不知有楊公其人，亦無不知有浦東中學，風會所及，舉世影從，國內私人聞而毀家興學者，允接踵不絕，先後得督學使及淸庭褒獎，而楊公弗爲歡，蓋辦學非敢以德名者，惜乎竟於是年四月與世長辭矣。此後成立校董會，綜理校政，宣統元年參照部定實科中學辦法，改訂章程，勵行級任制，並新購地皮若干畝，擴充運動塲，次年又擴充初等小學，再次年先校主得追贈監運使銜，宣付國史館立傳。至民國元二年購校門外隙地若干畝，改建校門，添設工業專科，招收預科生，三四五各年着重課程之改進，運動之提倡，六年先校主銅像落成，七年修訂校章，津貼本校畢業生考入指定大學者，每名年一百元，環校主銅像新建花園一座，名曰景園。八年改中學修業年限爲五年，改學年制爲學期制，就東南隅小學運動塲添建敎室十幢，宿舍九幢，改西部兩操塲爲跑冰塲。九年廢除定期試騐及記分辦法，津貼留學國外者每名年三百元，擴充敎職員宿舍。至十二年上學期派員赴寧蘇杭各地參觀施行新學制各校，自下學期起試行新學制，先改甲乙丙丁四學組爲初級中學，决年一月續改戊己庚辛壬癸六學組爲高級中學，施行學分制，六月修訂校章，分高中爲升學，普通，職業三組，實行擇業指導，訓育指導，火警訓練十四年初中恢復各科單獨編位制，擴充圖書館，改建實騐室，因受五卅慘案之刺激，勵行軍事訓練，次年五月杪立五卅國恥紀念牌於圖書館門前，十月前校董趙增濤先生捐欵，增建遊泳池一座。但自十六年以後，因時局關係，校務稍嫌散漫，而課程之改進，未嘗稍懈至二十三年高中畢業會考獲學校第一個人第一，是年四月校董會改組由敎育局聘請杜月笙先生等爲校董以來，始漸上軌道，二十四年二月經校董會敦聘韓覺民先生長校，本其革命之精神，力求整頓，不獨對敎學方面大加改良，而於校風之整飭允著成續。去年高中畢業會考又獲得個人第一。溯自開辦迄今前後舉業學生除小學初中不計外，已達一千四百餘人，昔日蒼烟白露之六里橋，今則已爲莘莘學子遊息之地，雖此後之發展無窮，而回思楊公毀家興學之心，其必有油然而興者歟！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>要求文憑兌現</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>北平各大學本屆畢業學生，發起組織服務運動大同盟，業經開過兩次籌備會議進行各種活動，該會之目的，是要求政府分發任用，這確眞是一個極正當的運動，也是一個極迫切的運動，但也是一個極困難的問題。</p>
<p>以前的失業大學生不算，就拿二十二二十三兩年度的全國失業大學生的統計數字看，已達九千六百餘，加以本屆畢業學生，總計不下一萬四五千人，試問這樣一大批大學生所消廢的經濟，腦力時間的代價，還可拿數字來計算麼？而共結果，使他們散處社會，成爲一羣高等流氓，這是我國家怎樣的大損失，大犧牲。</p>
<p>去年也曾有過同樣的集團，所謂職業大同盟也者，也會喊過畢業卽朱業的日號，掮過運動的旗幟，而他們努力所得的結果，僅得到設立工作諮詢處，職業介紹所等幾個虛名而已，完全得不到一個實際的解決辦法，所以這次集團的組織，是更進步，庶勻政府分發任用，而不放他們空言塞責，這個方法，本來是對的，不如此，就要變成去年職業大同盟的覆轍。</p>
<p>但是試看現在的政府，和各機關，無一處不是人浮於事，而爲人設官的地方，也不知多少，况當此國家和社會的經濟，都在不景氣的空氣籠罩中，那裏還有法子好想，並且現在吃飯的人，大抵都是「此馬來頭大，」又不好撤去現在吃飯的人，更換一批大學生去吃飯，這是决辦不到的事情，莫說中國，現在失業的呼聲，彌漫於全國，全世界，就是外國的大學生，完全要請政府任用，亦情勢所不可能，總之現在失業問題，不特大學如此，不過大學生是已經培養成功的人才，若使失業，更是可惜。</p>
<p>不過我有一些意見，也許是亂話，我想現在的大學生，决不要去靠政府吃飯，若靠政府吃飯的，是沒有志氣的大學生，現在的世界，是自力自救的世界，非但國家要自力自救，人民也要自救，現在一大批失業大學生中，想不少各色各樣絕好的專門人才，各人能本其所學，精心研究各種工藝，實業，或文學，創造些事跡出來，使社會應用，使大家拜服，或者個人自己去創造，或者集合多數同志去創造，現在工商業落後的國家，藉此得開一生路，亦未可知，如此非特個人的生活得以解决，卽國家社會，亦蒙其福。</p>
<p>至於團體行動，果然有極好的地方，但是也有極不好的地方任何集團，其中必有幾個發縱指示的中堅分子，假定這幾個中堅分子。一被人利用，或達到目的，則該團體卽等於散沙，或者竟無形打洧，此種情形，我見非罕，如是一大團體的組織，無非為少數人的工具，而大多數的人，不過在門外搖旗呐喊而已，故團體的行動，其現象不過如斯，現在北平各大學組織的服務運動大同盟，其中多是很好的知識份子，未必有如此現象，然亦不能不為之杜漸防微也。</p>
<h3>李敦兒</h3>
<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>「怎麼啦，這個字兒你都不認得了嗎？呵……」</p>
<p>先生把個臉扳得連縫兒都不透，冷冷地，硬得像塊鐵，眼睛向那個直瞪着，閃也不閃，像是恐怕那個趁空跑了的一樣。可是那個只把鼻子往里抽着，不言語，低着頭，兩隻手玩弄着油膩得發着烏油油的亮光的衣角，他一動也不動，恰似沒有聽到這麼回事。</p>
<p>這時，別的孩子們都興高彩烈的擠鼻弄眼兒了，有的偸偸地向他此劃着什麼，裂着嘴笑他，用二拇指在腮蛋兒上勾着羞他……總之，孩子們是高興了，因爲他們都料到將要有一齣精彩的戲要演出了！</p>
<p>「你啞巴了嗎，呵？李敦兒，李敦兒……怎麼不作聲哪？」接着籐子桿兒抽得講桌呯呼的響着「過來！」</p>
<p>那個就慢吞吞地拖着脚步走到講臺前去了，低着頭，不言語，兩隻手摺疊着油膩的衣角，疊起來又放開去。……</p>
<p>「八兒！」</p>
<p>淸脆的一聲響爲換了個哄堂大笑，籐子桿把李敦底腦袋敲了個棗般大的疙瘩，那個只哼了一聲，也沒言語。接連着「八兒！」「八兒！」「八兒！」……那個一陣寃屆把嘴一裂放聲的哭了，大家又是一陣好笑。</p>
<p>「你還哭？喂，你回過頭去呌火夥</p>
<p>你這個模樣兒，你這個……」</p>
<p>說着，先生一隻手抓住了他的頭頂向外一扭，大家縱聲的笑了，他自己也「哼」的一聲笑出來了。</p>
<p>「你還笑！你還笑！……笑！……笑！……」</p>
<p>「八兒！」「八兒！」「八兒！」</p>
<p>那　就又惱的哭了。</p>
<p>李敦兒在學校裏就是這樣的受着大家的氣。</p>
<p>他底爸爸是開小飯舖的，也知道念書中用，可是每等到李教兒下班了，他就喊他帮忙拉風箱呵，買菜呵，送飯呵……一直忙到夜晚，——這也就是他在家裏的功課了。</p>
<p>「　呀！好哇，李敦兒還送飯啦，還當小夥計啦！……」同學們耍碰見他時就這麼跳着嚷着鬧起來了。</p>
<p>「喂！李敦兒，給我送碗陽春麵呀！……哈哈……」</p>
<p>他聽兒同學們嚷，他照例是一聲不響的，低着頭走過去算完！</p>
<p>時間過的很快，一學期又快完了，李敦兒還是那模樣兒，長足進步了的只有頭頂上給藤子桿兒多敲上幾個　和污穢的衣裳越來得發亮了。</p>
<p>一天，紀念周上校長特別把李敦兒呌到講臺上去當着全體同學把他駡了一頓，末了說：「小朋友們，我們學校裹應該要這個沒有出息的孩子嗎？我們不應當要的！人家查學的來查，看見了這個束西（指着李敦兒）差一點兒耍氣死啦，就是，就是我們全校的名譽也給這個東西糟蹋了……」於是校長當塲宣怖把他除名了。</p>
<p>第二天，李敦兒哭着給他爸爸一塊兒來見校長了，</p>
<p>「怎麼，又呌這個東西來呢？？」校長嚷着。</p>
<p>「先生，……先生，小孩子請先生多多敎訓些……」他的爸爸很懇切的說，現着笑臉，兩雙手聚在胸前，像是要作揖了。</p>
<p>「什麼，敎訓？這樣的孩子沒法兒敎訓了！沒法敎訓！</p>
<p>「先生，我們窮人上學不容易呵，花了錢，就不呌上了嗎？……」</p>
<p>「你看你這些麻煩！我們學校裏有了這樣的學生簡直要坍臺了！……你看，你看！」校長說着指着其他乾凈而漂亮的孩子們說：「這個樣的才是我們學校裏的學生呢！你看，你看李敦兒這個樓樣兒，又笨，那怎麼能成呵？那怎麼</p>
<p>校長話還沒有說完就跑進辦公室去了。</p>
<p>半天，李敦兒的爸爸呆在那兒不觔一動，後來在他底老眼裏落下了兩滴淚，他領著孩子走向校外去，一璧哽咽着說：</p>
<p>「敦兒，……你應該，投…投生到！有錢的人家去就對了……」。</p>
<h3>掛牌</h3>
<p>— 里昻</p>
<p>啣着烟捲尾，從二百五十度托力克餚片裏，從廂房——診察室的花格玻璃窗裏，望到天井中石凳上那兩盆草蘭，已經枯萎了。長几上幾座大小形式不一的漬銀盾，顯然不及從前那樣光彩奪目，壁間的吳昌碩的花卉和浦文球的字，書架上整齊如砌磚般的『黃帝內經』和『本草綱目』，以及桌子上的古瓷水盂和大硯池…浸沉於無底的寂寞中</p>
<p>無底的寂寞把新掛牌的陸回春醫士包圍在冷宮般的診室中。從早晨到中午，從中午到夜，小小的脈枕上未放過一隻病人的手，他印了號票，亦印了方箋，用袁克文的字跡題着齊名，甲骨文的印章，是精緻的連史紙，可是她沒用過一張。他的孩子嘗拿了幾張去摺過猴子，摺過小船，摺過飛雀……</p>
<p>『小鬼，我化錢印來給你玩着樂的！斬你的手。』他也嘗毒　過。可是，他自己有時不亦拿着擦桌子嗎？井井他心中亦不免一陣好笑，之後，又緊跟着一連串的悲哀。峙辰鐘的針尖不懂事的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>從　到　，從　移　，　　　……陸回春醫士的心可焦了，同天井裏的草蘭般。他每天，每天，總是把日報一字不漏掉的看完，連廣告都未放過。他時刻留心大門上的銅鈴聲，希冀着有病人進門來，卽使不給診金，亦總算不丟臉了</p>
<p>可是，每次都是失望，失望，失望……『病人，我不能到外面去拉呵？』</p>
<p>『不拉，但是，每月的開支那裏來呢？總得設個法，不然，索性把牌除去了，省得，省得，房錢不是就要二十了塊嗎，你不想想！』陸回春醫士的夫人常常這樣背書似的背給丈夫聽。原因是掛牌時化去的那筆欵子是她去設法來的。備酒，買傢伙，租房子，求字畫……一番舖張，祇留着自己觀賞。陸回春醫士心境惡劣的時候，便和他夫人吵起來</p>
<p>『除牌，你嘴裏說得出，我面子丟不下。你這不知世面的女人！』</p>
<p>有時，女人可嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來了。『…沒生意…不是我…我害你…你的，你這沒有良心的…你枉然吃了墨水…』邊哭邊嘮叨着。這時陸回春醫士心裏有千萬隻螞蟻在亂爬，扔下『醫經原旨』站起來，眼眶在二百五十度鏡片裏潤濕了，他從木版書卷中，習知了『黃漢醫道』，可是，他來曾習知過怎樣才得安定生活？以前掛牌時的一番希望，完全被冲淡了。</p>
<p>『誰又害了誰呢？總之，在這倒霉的勢口，甚麼都是糟！哭又有什麼用的？眼淚不是治窮的藥。』可是，他自己的眼淚却差點兒掛下啦。</p>
<p>是一個出於意料之外的下午，陸回春醫士自己正提了茶壺上老虎灶的當兒，却來了一個病人；『先生，這裏就到就看的嗎？』一連串的『是是是…』從他嘴裏發出來，於是，新的小枕上第一次擱上病人的手，方箋第一次開上脈案，第一次用着『七紫三羊』寫出藥味。他是那樣小心地看畢掛牌後三個月來的第一個病人。</p>
<p>桌子上留着四個雙銀毫，陸回春醫士正不知要怎樣地看重它？</p>

<p>蘇州夜話</p>
<p>在風景美麗山明水秀的蘇州　　飯店裏的鄰接小廳之一角，有甲乙丙丁四個男生和一個女生正在熱心的必畫，——這，就是老畫家劉叔康從老遠的北平，特地的把她們帶來研究這大自然美的蘇州，在這裏，這能够看見羅馬似城頭的月，威尼斯似的街頭的水，弓陀拉似的船，還有那船上詰婆四似的女人，這是多麼的有詩意和研究畫的資料呢？</p>
<p>但是，你恐怕還不知道呢？這位老畫家是一個家散人亡心裹負了極創傷的痛苦的一個可憐人啊！</p>
<p>可是現在，他已經有一位自小沒有父親而認這位老畫家做女兒的楊小鳳啦！她也就是他的男女學生中的一個最能够長進的活潑天眞的姑娘，……</p>
<p>老實告訴你們吧！這是十幾年前的事啦；這位老畫家也是有妻子，並且還是蘇州人呢？不但有妻子還有一個女兒哩！要是到現在的話也不就是長得跟小鳳一樣的可愛嗎？</p>
<p>可是，那時的他太醉心於藝術啦；他想竭大半生的精力，畫這「萬里長城」以象徵我們民族的偉大魄力，畫了整整的五年，就逢了兩個軍閥奪爭北平的一次最可詛咒的內戰，可是他的家，他的畫室，就成了軍閥們的炮火的目標，他爲了藝術，就死守着他五年來的結晶而未完成的畫，他叫他的妻子跟女兒先逃，……後來，畫是變了無情炮火的犧牲品啦；從此的老畫家，再也找不着他親愛的妻子和聰明伶利的女兒了！</p>
<p>……這時候，他可眞的我到他十幾年前的失了蹤的女兒哩！你不聽見嗎？那個賣花女正唱着她小時候她的父親老盡家敎她而她最愛唱的那首「淡淡長江水，悠悠客遠情：落花雖有恨，墮地亦無聲，」詩嗎？你們要知道賣花女的母親，也就是老畫家的妻子，……的內中的一切經過嗎？那麼請你們在無綫電裏聽我們的節目吧！</p>

<h3>Curbing Japan's Increasing Troop Deployment to North China: Ambassador Xu Submits Further Representations</h3>
<p>Second Batch of Japanese Troops Ordered to Proceed to Tanggu; Japan Also Plans to Increase Naval Presence in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic sources reveal that following the Japanese response regarding the troop increase in North China, the Foreign Ministry has instructed Ambassador Xu again to make earnest representations to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. It is understood that Xu has already submitted a written representation to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, expressing that the increase of Japanese troops in North China is still sufficient to cause concern among the Chinese populace and hoping that the previous discussions would be taken into account to find ways to prevent it. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than ten staff members and junior officers from the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters went to Tanggu on the 28th to oversee the newly arriving expanded forces on the 29th. The new barracks in Fengtai are being hastily constructed. In a month, over 400 Japanese soldiers from Tianjin will depart to garrison there. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ishii stated that the newly added Japanese troops in North China would definitely not enter the Pinghan Railway line. The military headquarters generally agrees with the customs' anti-smuggling principles, but armed anti-smuggling in the demilitarized zone within the war zone will absolutely not be allowed. If a special agreement is made, it might be accommodated under negotiated conditions. The Japanese side has no intention of establishing large-scale smuggling companies or building a Tanggu-to-Tianjin-via-Zhili automobile road; if such a thing exists, it would be on the Hebei-East side. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Senior staff officer Ishii of the Tianjin Japanese military headquarters stated that rumors of a change in commander of the North China garrison, Japan adopting a more aggressive policy towards North China, an increase of 50,000 troops, and sheltering smuggling activities are all misrepresentations. Japan's established policy, as approved by the military headquarters, will not change with personnel changes. The appointment of Tashiro as commander is a matter of military authority and position, unrelated to policy. The strengthening of the North China garrison, up to the continued arrival of troops on the 29th, totals about 7,000 men. After the 29th, no more troops will come. Their garrison locations will still be limited to the areas along the Beining Railway and Tianjin-Beijing, according to the Boxer Protocol, with some stationed in Fengtai and Tongzhou under special circumstances. There are absolutely no further advancement preparations at present. Smuggling has nothing to do with the military. Outside claims that this is related to the military headquarters are a misunderstanding. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In addition to increasing a large number of ground troops in North China, the long-rumored issue of a permanent naval presence in Tianjin has now also been decided. The recent promotions of naval officers Kuwahara and Kubo to the positions of captains are for this reason. It is said that the first step will be to dispatch four destroyers and two or four cruisers from Lushun to be permanently stationed in Tanggu. The second step will only be realized after the harbor is deepened to allow large ships to enter and exit. It is rumored that the first step is expected to be implemented in early June. (28th China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The second batch of newly added Japanese troops in North China will arrive in Tanggu from Japan tomorrow and transfer to Tianjin. A number of officers and soldiers are scheduled to arrive in Beiping from Tianjin tomorrow night and then transfer to Tongxian to be stationed. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiao Zhenying Discusses Stable Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Chen Juesheng Arrives in Beiping to Meet with Song</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying stated that the diplomatic situation is stable. Do not lightly believe outside speculations. He will return to Tianjin after dealing with the affairs of the Economic Committee. The Economic Committee has suggested to the Hebei Political Council a proposal to reorganize the Hebei Provincial Bank, which is roughly divided into three points. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An official stated that in this critical situation, they will do their best to persevere. Many rumors are unreliable. Although there is no progress in the diplomatic situation, there has also been no change. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Diplomatic officials from Hebei and Chahar are informally in contact in Beiping. Mr. Er met with Matsumuro on the 28th, and the future is showing a turning point. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng took a special train to Beiping at 9:00 AM on the 28th. He will convene the Communications Committee on the 29th to discuss railway construction. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Juesheng arrived in Beiping from Tianjin by special train at 10:40 AM on the morning of the 28th. After getting off the train, he went to Wuyiku to meet with Song Zheyuan and report on matters. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Recommends Xu Yongchang to Serve as Shanxi Security Commander</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The issue of the new position for former Shanxi Chairman Xu Yongchang has been resolved. Shanxi Pacification Director Yan Xishan has recommended him to serve as the Shanxi Provincial Security Commander. It can be submitted for approval at next week's Executive Yuan meeting. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) After Zhao Daiwen was appointed as the Chairman of Shanxi Province, he met with Yan Xishan this morning to discuss everything. It is reported that Zhao, due to his old age, is still being modest, and whether or not he will take office has not yet been decided. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tsuda Visits Foreign Minister Zhang</h3>
<p>Tsuda, a retired Japanese naval officer, visited Foreign Minister Zhang at the Foreign Ministry on the afternoon of the 28th at 3:00 PM, accompanied by naval attache Rimen from the embassy, as a private courtesy call and to pay his respects. He left after a brief exchange. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu Discusses Methods to Curb Smuggling; Chinese and Foreign Merchants Should Sincerely Assist the Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu stated that the government's formulation of various anti-smuggling measures is primarily aimed at safeguarding the interests of legitimate Chinese and foreign merchants and preventing the shaking of our nation's economic foundation. All Chinese and foreign chambers of commerce and trade associations in various regions should feel the pain of this self-interest and sincerely assist the government in exposing tax evasion and smuggled goods and refusing to sell smuggled goods. If no one accepts smuggled goods, the trend of smuggling can naturally be curbed. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Road Transport Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office; Headquarters to Be Established in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The location of the headquarters for the General Inspection Office for Preventing Road Transport Smuggling, along with over ten branch offices, will be established after the organizational regulations are drafted by the Inspector General of Customs and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sources in the transportation sector reveal that the Ministry of Finance has established inspection offices at various railway stations to check smuggled goods. Personnel for the inspection offices at various stations along the Jinpu Railway, including Pukou, Bengbu, Xuzhou, and Jinan, have been appointed by the ministry and will arrive separately on the 28th to begin organizing. The personnel for the inspection office in Tianjin will also arrive within days. As for which station along the Beining Railway should be established, it must be decided after the Ministry of Finance personnel arrive in Tianjin for discussion. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ancient Artifacts Safely Returned Home; Zhang Qun Cables Thanks to Britain</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Zhang cabled British Foreign Secretary Eden on the 28th to express thanks for the safe return of the ancient artifacts. The original cable stated: "On the occasion of the safe return of the ancient artifacts to China, I respectfully represent the Chinese government in sincerely expressing thanks to the British government for all the friendly assistance along the way, especially the escort by the British Navy." (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Organizing Committee for the Chinese Art Exhibition in London will hold a plenary organizing committee meeting at Mingzhi Building, Examination Yuan on the morning of the 31st. In addition to Wang Shijie's report on participating in the London Art Exhibition and the preparations for the Beijing Exhibition, a detailed inspection of the returned ancient artifacts will be conducted to show solemnity.

<h3>Rōnin Forcibly Occupy Trains; Transporting Smuggled Goods South</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 29th, on train number 21 southbound on the Jinpu Railway, rōnin forcibly loaded over fifty pieces of smuggled rayon and over twenty packages of sugar. On train number 305, 150 pieces of rayon, twenty bundles of cigarette paper, and over twenty packages of sugar were forcibly loaded. Dozens of rōnin armed with weapons escorted them.

<h3>The Development of Japanese Goods in China</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Now that Japanese silk, cotton, and woven goods have failed to achieve their goals in the East, and their advance into the South has been thwarted by Australia, they have retreated to the South Seas islands to seek development. There, each has its own master. As they enter a no-man's-land, is China the only option in the West? In the past two years, the import and export of Japanese goods to China is more than official records can fully reflect. Based on what is heard and seen, it is not far from the mature situation of Japanese goods monopolizing the Chinese market. Taking only the cotton textile industry as an example, the Japanese textile factories established in China have almost all made huge profits in recent years. Every six months, the net profit easily reaches 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. They buy old factories, add new factories, and increase the number of spindles, which is not comparable to the quickly failing Chinese yarn factories. The cotton goods sold on the market are mostly Japanese goods, according to inquiries. The north-south sales routes of Chinese local factory cloth have been cut off. What supports the efforts to maintain the current situation is only the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The price of rayon and its woven products has fallen sharply due to the proliferation of smuggled goods. Woolen fabrics were originally Western goods, but due to exchange rates, the cost has increased, and it is beyond the current purchasing power. As a result, all the goods sold on the market are Japanese goods. Western sugar and seafood need no explanation. Only selling Japanese goods can obtain high profits, and Guangdong sugar sales have been greatly affected. Only copper ingots used to be used for hardware. Since Japanese factories once hosted Chinese merchants, the import of Japanese hardware has increased greatly, almost replacing Western goods. Only construction hardware has not yet gained a foothold. The Japanese, leveraging their political and economic power, are thinking of asking China to sign various construction project contracts to secure outlets for Japanese materials. Cigarette sales have also been affected by smuggling. More than twenty cigarette factories in Shanghai that had sales offices in the north have virtually ceased operations. Other sundries and the goods displayed in the stalls are all Eastern goods. Furthermore, the shipping lines going north are all losing money and reducing their schedules, while only Japanese ships' business is booming. Therefore, not only are domestic businesses weak and unable to withstand a single blow, but even seasoned British and American merchants are far behind. This is truly a time when Japanese merchants are complacent.</p>
<p>The standard of tax rates is extremely difficult to define. Those who give and receive always believe it is too high or too low. Even retaliation is unlikely to be exactly proportional. Those who retaliate fear it is not enough, while those who receive retaliation think it is too much. Therefore, there is no end to tariff wars and trade disputes, and retaliation will have no end. This back-and-forth accumulation of resentment cannot be resolved short of a duel. The way of commerce lies in good faith, and the way of development lies in peace. Adhering to good faith, there will be no deceit between us, and all matters can be resolved. With peace, we can exchange what we have for what we lack, and each party will benefit from the transaction. Stores must be polite and humble to win the favor of customers in order to develop their business. If a vicious face and arrogant attitude are displayed, even if there is a situation where one must buy, one will deeply hate and detest it. International trade is also the same. As the ancient sage said, "What I do not wish others to do to me, I also wish not to do to others." Do those who like to fight market battles forget this saying?</p>

<h3>U.S. Prepares to Assist in Stabilizing World Currency</h3>
<p>Unofficial Remarks from Washington Official Circles</p>
<p>New Developments Expected After French Cabinet Formation</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, senior officials here made unofficial remarks, indicating that the United States is prepared to assist in restoring the international gold standard. It is believed that most countries in the world largely share this view. The biggest obstacle is what Treasury Secretary Morgenthau called "global instability," especially the lurking danger of war everywhere. Government leaders today claimed that the balance of international payments has made it easier to stabilize world currencies, and that some of the world's most important monetary systems have reached levels after the economic decline, making it not difficult to adjust mutually. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Leftist leaders have included an international monetary conference to stabilize the U.S. dollar, British pound, and French franc in the new government's platform. At that time, the stable exchange rate of the French franc will be lower than the current level. It is reported today that the position of the new government's finance minister will be taken by Socialist Congressman Auriol. Mr. Auriol believes that this conference should be convened as soon as possible. The most difficult thing is whether the United Kingdom and the United States recognize this as an appropriate time.

<h3>Chinese, U.S., and British Representatives Denounce Japan's Poisoning of China at the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Wherever Japanese Power Reaches, Poison Inevitably Follows</p>
<p>U.S. Representative's Speech Filled with Hatred of Evil</p>
<p>Our Representative Reaffirms Determination to Eliminate Poison</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee met yesterday. U.S. Representative Fuller and Chinese Representative Hu Shih-tse both spoke, criticizing Japan for not taking appropriate measures to prohibit Japanese and Korean nationals from selling drugs. Fuller said that the relationship between Japanese nationals in China and the sale of morphine, heroin, and cocaine is closer and more extensive than that of the people of any other country. The Japanese government should urgently find ways to punish Japanese and Korean nationals who secretly manufacture and illegally sell these drugs, and should not delay any longer. The actions of these people have stained the reputation of the Japanese nation. He hoped that the large-scale supply of opium in China could be reduced, saying that unless this is done, China will continue to be a scourge of the world in terms of narcotics. Fuller then cited the almost unbelievable situation in eastern Hebei, the disgraceful situation in Tianjin and Beijing, the sharp increase in newly addicted smokers in the four counties of Hebei, and the current situation in Shanghai, saying that everything was caused by Japanese and Korean private merchants. This is solid proof of the Japanese authorities' inability to act, because the punishments imposed on private merchants are extremely contemptible under Japanese law. The issue of excessively lenient punishments has repeatedly been brought to the attention of the Opium Advisory Committee. This has been a publicly known malpractice for many years. The committee's attention to this completely ridiculous situation, year after year, has not led to effective action. This is truly unfortunate. Now, not only China, but even Japan and its territories, have become havens and headquarters for these Japanese and Korean nationals who poison their compatriots for personal gain. Failing to punish these drug dealers is not only an unfriendly act toward the Chinese people, but also harmful to North America, Canada, and Mexico. The facts are all there, and we have no need to hide them. Wherever Japanese power reaches in the Far East, drugs inevitably follow. The greatest punishment is merely a few weeks of rest in prison, and the fines are only equivalent to the profits earned by private merchants in a day or a bad transaction. Chinese Representative Hu Shih-tse then spoke, briefly outlining the National Government's plan to ban opium and drugs, saying that in 193, a total of 970 people were executed for illegally selling, smoking, and manufacturing drugs, and that the life of the nation now depends on the struggle against drugs, which we must persevere in to the end.</p>
<p>Committee British Advisor Lyall said that in Changli County in the demilitarized zone of northern Hebei, there are now 131 opium dens. Although the authorities want to close them, they cannot do so because most are run by Japanese. There are 323 opium dens in Xiamen and 319 opium dens in Fuzhou, most of which are also opened by Japanese, especially Taiwanese. If the Chinese people know that heroin is enough to destroy their lives, Japan is truly to blame. The resulting resentment may be passed down for generations. The Opium War of 1839 strained the relationship between China and Britain for about a hundred years. May Japan not repeat Britain's mistake. Japanese Representative Ota said that the Japanese authorities have not fully understood the problem, and the Japanese government will work hard to clarify the matter. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Representative Also Said to Find Ways to Assist in Cracking Down</h3>
<p>And Claimed to Have Captured Many Japanese and Korean Nationals</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee met today, and Chinese Representative Hu Shih-tse elaborated on the various measures taken by his government to enforce the ban on drugs, and explained that the implementation of the ban was quite difficult in some places, especially in North China, and hoped that the neighboring countries' authorities would provide assistance, stating that the Chinese government now has the determination to ban drugs and is determined to completely ban them within six years, and has taken various measures, such as the gradual reduction of poppy cultivation and the supervision of opium production. Anyone who violates the ban will be severely punished without leniency. In 1935 alone, as many as 970 people were sentenced to death for violating the ban. Unfortunately, the people of certain countries used their special status (referring to extraterritoriality) to sell drugs on a large scale. We hereby appeal to all countries to cooperate in order to prevent such drug trafficking. "As far as I know, the authorities and some impartial people in a certain country, the country to which the drug traffickers belong, are all filled with righteous indignation about drug trafficking and have cooperated with us on many occasions. We are grateful for their enthusiasm. However, in some places in China, especially in North China, the situation is still serious, making it difficult to implement the ban." The Japanese representative then spoke, saying that the Japanese government is extremely anxious about the illegal sale of drugs in northern China, especially the port of Tianjin. The Japanese government has sent police officers to the consulate there to arrest drug traffickers. Recently, many Japanese and Koreans have been arrested for the crime of drug trafficking, and have been deported back to their country by the Japanese authorities. British Representative Squire (Chairman of the Opium Advisory Committee) then presented and read the report he had received privately, saying that in Changli County in the demilitarized zone of Hebei Province, China, which is no more than 28 square miles in area, there are as many as 31 opium dens selling morphine and heroin. These opium dens are all set up by Japanese people, and Chinese officials have no way to interfere. He also said that the Chinese government has made many efforts to solve the opium problem and is now trying to ban the private sale of morphine and heroin. Japan must cooperate in this regard. However, it is also true that drug traffickers come from all countries, not just Japanese. "The import of opium into southern China is a matter of a hundred years ago. The British government was the first to do so. Today, the Japanese government's actions should be wiser than those of the British government a hundred years ago. This is what we earnestly hope for." Finally, Spanish Representative Casares spoke, saying that the Chinese government wants to ask other countries for cooperation, and this committee should certainly respond. I hereby propose a draft resolution on cooperation in banning opium, and I urge you to submit it to a vote. At this point, the chairman announced an adjournment of the meeting and a continuation of the discussion tomorrow. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>Legitimate Interests of Japan Also Harmed</p>
<p>Britain Has Urged the Tokyo Authorities to Pay Attention</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Eden replied in the House of Commons today to the various questions asked by the members of parliament about smuggling in North China. The members of parliament also put forward various proposals to improve the current situation, but the Foreign Secretary replied that, in his opinion, the best way to curb smuggling is for the Chinese customs authorities to restore their usual exercise of power. As far as he knows, no government other than China, the United Kingdom, and the United States has yet questioned Tokyo about this matter. The British government has asked the Japanese government to pay attention to the huge amount of smuggling in North China, which is enough to harm the general legitimate interests of Japanese nationals. (Reuters Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, several members of parliament once again raised the issue of smuggling in northern China. Conservative MP Mullen argued that Japan's encouragement of smuggling in North China is contradictory to the "Royal Way Doctrine" previously advocated by that country in Manchuria. This should be negotiated with the Japanese government. A customs patrol fleet should be organized in North China to stop smuggling. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the government would not ignore any appropriate measures that could satisfactorily resolve the smuggling issue. "I believe that the best way to stop smuggling in North China is for the Chinese customs authorities to be able to restore their normal ability to exercise their powers." Another Conservative MP, Chilton, then asked the government whether Japan's loans to China were also guaranteed by Chinese customs duties. If so, then for the sake of its own interests, it would be appropriate to do its best to promote the efficiency of the Chinese customs. Should the British government negotiate with the Japanese government and urge it to pay attention to this? Foreign Secretary Eden replied that some of Japan's loans to China were guaranteed by customs and salt revenues. Some of these loans have been in arrears for principal and interest since 1925. He also said that the large-scale smuggling in North China is harmful to the legitimate interests of Japan. Britain has urged the Japanese government to pay attention to this.

<h3>Cheng Tien-fang Gives a Speech on China's National Conditions in Berlin</h3>
<p>Significant Progress Has Been Made in Political Construction</p>
<p>(Berlin) Dr. Cheng Tien-fang gave a speech on the situation in China at the Sino-German University Students' Club tonight. He first described the social, political, cultural, and economic situation of China over the past two thousand years, and said that the monarchy that had lasted for thousands of years came to an end with the establishment of the Republic in 1911. He then explained the achievements of the National Government over the years, including the development of transportation, the encouragement of agriculture, and the development of minerals. In terms of society, the most significant progress is that the nationalism cultivated by the people of the whole country has been awakened vigorously. Chinese intellectuals are aware of the value of both European culture and their own culture. "Taking the strengths of the two cultures and integrating them is the urgent task." Ambassador Cheng finally praised the New Life Movement advocated by President Chiang of the Executive Yuan of China. The audience was very interested. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Arita Refreshes the Diplomatic Lineup</h3>
<p>Major Changes in Overseas Ambassadors and Consuls</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita is considering reshuffling personnel to refresh diplomacy and renew the atmosphere of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A decision has now been made and will be submitted to the Cabinet meeting on the 29th for formal approval before an order is issued. The following are the personnel changes related to China:</p>
<p>Appoint First Secretary of the Embassy in China, Kuno Ieshiro, as Consul General in Sydney, Australia. Appoint Consul General in Shanghai, Ishisha Jotaro, as Minister to Siam. Transfer Consul General in Guangzhou, Kawasoe Tatsuo, as Consul General in Shanghai. (Daimon Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an order on the 28th, appointing Second Secretary of the Embassy in "Manchukuo," Hanawa Yoshitaka, as First Secretary of the Embassy in China, and appointing Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tajiri Yoshichika, as Consul General in Tianjin, concurrently First Secretary of the Embassy. (Daimon Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita has decided to drastically refresh the foreign lineup. The first step will be to decide on the transfers of consuls general and councilors at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. After these transfers are carried out, it is expected that there will not necessarily be any major transfers of the rank of minister this year. The vacancies and replacements among the current ministers that can be foreseen are for the Czech Republic, Romania, Greece, Egypt, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, and Finland. There are also those who are currently ministers on standby and will be reappointed. After these ministers return to the country, they will be gradually replenished. The current Consul General in Batavia, Koeshida, will be appointed as the Minister to Mexico. Fujii, the councilor of the British Embassy, will succeed as the Minister to the Czech Republic. Sakashiro, the councilor of the Soviet Embassy, will succeed as the Minister to Finland. The others will be filled by local directors of the ministry. The scope of transfers of local directors of the ministry is extensive. Among the ambassadors, Sato, the ambassador to France, and Ota, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, are about to resign. Sugimura, the ambassador to Italy, will be appointed as the successor to the ambassador to France, and Togo, the director of the Eurasian Bureau, will be appointed as the successor to the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Shigemitsu, the former vice minister, will be appointed as the ambassador to Italy. Foreign Minister Arita has abandoned the lukewarm personnel administration of the past and is reflecting the atmosphere of the new era of administrative reform. It remains to be seen what kind of innovative personnel administration will be carried out. (Denko Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>30,000 People Addicted to Smoking in England</h3>
<p>Undersecretary of the Interior Claims No More Than 700 at Most</p>
<p>(London) At the House of Commons meeting today, Labour MP Henderson (son of the late Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson) raised a question, saying that according to reports, there are 30,000 people in England who are confirmed to be addicted to smoking opium. Is this true? Undersecretary of the Interior Geoffrey Lloyd replied, "The reports in the newspapers are completely unfounded. According to reports received by the Home Office, there are at most 700 people in England who are addicted to opium and are known to the authorities, and they are limited to London alone. There are none elsewhere. Given the size of England, this number is negligible." (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Activities of the American Black Legion</h3>
<p>Its Power Has Spread to 15 States</p>
<p>Congress Establishes a Committee to Investigate</p>
<p>Detroit, USA Wayne County Prosecutor McCrea announced today that he has requested the assistance of federal government authorities in investigating the activities of the "Black Legion," and said that he has evidence to show that the party's terrorist activities have now spread to fifteen states. They also have activities in the cities of New York and Chicago. However, he is unwilling to release the details. McCrea has just sent a telegram to Attorney General Cummings, saying that the Black Legion has moved corpses across state lines, and therefore has entered the jurisdiction of the federal government. The twelve members of the Black Legion captured here will be given a six-day extension for retrial at McCrea's request in order to collect evidence. However, newspapers are spreading the rumor that a membership application form of the party has been found, and McCrea's name is prominently signed on it. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Australia Increases Tariffs</h3>
<p>Japan's Protest Is Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Tokyo According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 28th, Consul General Murai in Australia, on the orders of the ministry, sent a public letter to the Australian Minister of Customs on the 26th, protesting against the Australian government's implementation of the new tariff law, which refuses the entry of Japanese goods, and demanding its reconsideration. However, because the Australian government's response to this was insincere, he met with the Minister of Customs on the 28th to convey the serious determination of the Japanese government and people, and urged him to give a serious reply.

<h3>May 28 Reuters Special Commercial Intelligence Telegram</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London Gold Price: Today, it eased, falling by one and a half pence, to 139 shillings and six pence.</p>
<p>London Bar Silver: Today, the silver market was stable, with spot and futures prices both at 19 and 9375 pence. The former rose 1875, and the latter 125. There was a general buying trend, and there were not many suppliers, so the price rose.</p>
<p>Mount Lyell Bar Silver: Because the London telegram was higher, the futures market was stable this morning. At the opening, the July futures price was 45.00-45.45, 25 pounds higher than yesterday's close.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market was mixed this morning. The price of the pound was stable. The British-American exchange rate opened at 4.985 dollars, 0.03125 lower than yesterday's American-British close. An hour later, it recovered 0.0625.

<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: The stock market was quiet at the opening this morning, and prices were mixed. Stock prices mostly fluctuated very little. The exciting second-quarter earnings reports were offset by the renewed instability of France's financial situation. Although market sentiment tended to be firm in the later market, only a few prices were higher than yesterday's close. There was some profit-taking near noon, and there was more profit-taking in copper mining and steel stocks. At this time, various security prices were 0.25 lower and 1.25 higher than yesterday's close. Here are the stock prices in New York</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: Today, someone bought a small amount, which broke the easing trend, but after stabilizing once, the price fell again due to a lack of buying. At 1:00 p.m., the May futures price was still 5 shillings and six and a half pence, the same as the previous close.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Today, the cotton market rose by one pound because the U.S. cotton futures market was stable. At 1:00 p.m., the May futures price was 6.27.</p>
<p>New York Cotton: Today, weather news was favorable to the bulls, which aroused some speculative interest. Prices were stable at the opening. The July futures price rose by three pounds to 11.52. There was a slight profit-taking later. At noon, the July futures price was 11.51, one pound lower than yesterday's close.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: This morning, the weather problem was still the main factor affecting the rise and fall of wheat prices. The market was firm due to speculative buying. At noon, the July futures price rose by 375 to 84.25. However, there was a slight reaction after the opening.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The rubber market was stable today. At 1:00 p.m., the transaction price for July and September futures was 7 and 375 pence, 0.0625 higher than yesterday's close.</p>
<p>New York: The rubber market was stable at the opening due to buying by peers. The July futures price rose by four pounds to 15.66. The market then turned quiet and uninteresting. At noon, the July futures price returned to the opening price. Here are the prices of goods in New York</p>

<h3>Bribery Case Discovered in Tokyo, Involving Key Figures in the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Director of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Hirai Kikumatsu, and the Director of the Tokyo Improvement Office, Kuroda Taketada, were suddenly summoned by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office at 7:00 a.m. on the 28th. As a result of the interrogation, suspicion of dereliction of duty in a certain bidding incident was strong, and they were detained in the Ichigaya Prison. Dr. Hirai was the builder of the undersea railway between Shimonoseki and Moji, and Kuroda also held an important position in the Kanmon improvement project. The detention of these two men has caused a major setback in the work of the Kanmon Strait and all other improvement work. On the 25th, the prosecution authorities formally indicted the Director of the Civil Engineering Bureau of Yokohama City, Ota Meiji, and two others, and three contractors, including Ishimatsu Kiyoshi, the Tokyo branch manager of Okumura Group, on charges of bribery and giving bribes. Among the others involved in the case, three officials appointed by the Emperor and six high-ranking officials had confirmed evidence of receiving bribes. The authorities, in view of the frequent abuses in the bidding for improvement projects, have now decided to sweep away the abuses and investigate key figures in the Ministry of Railways to remove the root of the trouble.

<h3>Major Strike in the Metallurgical Industry Around Paris</h3>
<p>Demanding an Increase in Current Wages and the Implementation of a 40-Hour Work Week</p>
<p>(Paris) Workers in various metallurgical factories in the capital area, especially those building airplanes and automobiles, have recently gone on strike. It is understood that the demands put forward by the striking workers are all related to professional issues, such as the fact that workers in some factories are demanding an increase in wages because the current wages are too low; the implementation of a 40-hour work week; and the work contracts of workers in factories around the capital should be concluded by the representatives of their respective unions and the employers to ensure uniformity. It is generally believed that this strike can be resolved by mutual agreement between labor and management. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Workers in various metallurgical factories around the capital have gone on strike. It is understood that the situation is due to the fact that workers in more than a dozen factories have made a number of demands to the factories, which have not been satisfactorily answered, so they went on strike early in the morning of the 26th. The factories then invited representatives of the strikers to negotiate, and as a result, most factory workers had received satisfaction by the afternoon of that day, but some factory workers were still stopping work and staying in the factory, and declared that they would not leave the factory until they had obtained the same result. Among them, the workers of the Nieuport aircraft factory in Issy-les-Moulineaux and the Lavalette electrical metallurgical factory in Saint-Ouen were particularly persistent. Hundreds of workers from each factory stayed in the factory overnight. They did not begin negotiations with the factories until yesterday morning. The factories stated that the demands made by the workers could not be accepted immediately because they had to first reach an understanding with other factories in the same industry. However, the unions, in view of the fact that workers in some factories had already achieved victory, further expanded the strike in the hope of implementing their original demands. As a result, workers at the Hotchkiss arms factory in Gennevilliers (famous for manufacturing machine guns) went on strike yesterday morning, but after the factory gave a satisfactory reply in the afternoon, they immediately resumed work. In general, although many of the striking workers occupied the factory buildings, their attitude was still peaceful, so no incidents occurred. The police did not have any contact with the workers. The striking workers were supplied with food and drink by their families and some municipal organizations that sympathized with the workers. Representatives of labor and management in the factories that have not resumed work will continue to negotiate today, but it is generally believed that if the two sides cannot quickly reach a compromise, the strike is likely to spread.

<h3>Britain Increases Destroyer Numbers, U.S. and Japan Both Reserve Rights</h3>
<p>Japan's Submarine Tonnage Exceeds Limit by 20,000 Tons; U.S. Advocates Proportionate Increase</p>
<p>(London) The British government recently sent notes to the U.S. and Japan, making two requests. The U.S. destroyer total tonnage is proposed to be maintained at 190,000 tons, which is 40,000 tons more than stipulated in the London Naval Treaty. Britain has a total of four 10,000-ton cruisers whose service years have expired and should be scrapped. One of them is planned to be converted into a training ship, and the remaining three are to be converted into Class B cruisers. The Japanese government's reply to this note was recently delivered to the Foreign Office by the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Fujii. Naval experts in the ministry are now studying it. According to the ministry, the Japanese reply is not satisfactory to Britain. Once the experts have completed their research, the government will ask the Japanese government to explain certain points in the reply. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Japan's reply to Britain, proposing to reserve 40,000 tons of destroyers exceeding the limit of the London Naval Treaty, was delivered to the British Foreign Office yesterday. Naval observers here believe that this reply does not address the main point, because although Japan stated that it could also reserve submarine tonnage exceeding the treaty limit, it did not specifically state how much tonnage it would reserve. This kind of answer from Japan is not surprising, because it has long been known that Japan attaches more importance to submarines than to destroyers and cruisers when building submarines beyond the treaty limit. According to estimates by the authorities here, Japan should have 52,000 tons of submarines under the treaty, but will soon have 72,000 tons, exceeding the treaty limit by about 20,000 tons. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Acting Secretary of the Navy Standley expressed his opinion today, saying that if Britain retains excessive destroyer tonnage, then Britain must invoke the "escalator clause" of the 1930 London Naval Treaty. Britain increased its destroyer strength from 150,000 tons to 190,000 tons, exceeding the treaty limit, based on the reason that non-signatory countries greatly increased their destroyer tonnage. The U.S. Navy Department will probably recommend to the State Department that Standley's opinion be adopted as the attitude towards Britain. As for the Japanese reply, Standley did not comment because he had not received an official report. It is expected that the U.S. Navy Department's report on this matter will be submitted to the State Department within days, stating in essence that the United States does not in principle oppose Britain increasing its destroyer strength, but in strict interpretation of the treaty, Britain should formally adopt the "escalator clause." It is heard that the United States also expressed the same opinion on the rumored Japanese request to retain the excessive submarine tonnage that should be dismantled under the treaty. According to the "escalator clause" of the London Naval Treaty, if any signatory country believes that the construction of new ships by non-signatory countries hinders its national security, it can notify other signatory countries of its opinion and increase its tonnage. Then other signatory countries can also increase it proportionally. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Navy Department believes that the "escalator clause" of the 1930 London Naval Treaty can guarantee that the United States can increase certain warships according to its needs, so as to be on par with other countries. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>"Queen Mary" Bravely Sails the Seas, Advances Towards the Atlantic</h3>
<p>Speed of Thirty Nautical Miles Per Hour; New York Prepares a Grand Welcome</p>
<p>(Via Queen Mary's telegraph) The British super-liner "Queen Mary" is making its maiden voyage in the Atlantic today, at a speed of twenty nautical miles per hour. The sea is calm. Because the ship is capable of breaking sailing records, the ship's officers say that they do not hope to set a new record. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Cherbourg, France. The new British White Star Line ship, "Queen Mary", sailed from Southampton at 4:34 PM yesterday for its maiden voyage and will arrive here tonight, preparing to cross the Atlantic. It is late at night, but many people are watching to welcome the new ship on its first visit here. At the same time, the captain received a telegram from the British King, wishing him a smooth journey. The captain immediately replied with thanks. At 12:35 AM, the Queen Mary sailed out of Cherbourg, heading straight for New York. The captain told a Reuters reporter that he was confident that this new ship would have great success, but the issue of breaking the speed record was not easy, because the ship has a fixed schedule, and if it follows this schedule, it will not be able to break the record. The British generally hope that this ship can win back the Atlantic speed title for Britain. To win it, the ship must sail to the Ambrose Lighthouse before 6:00 AM on Monday. It is noted that this title is currently held by the French ship "Normandie." (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) The American people are extremely interested in the maiden voyage of the White Star liner "Queen Mary." Radio stations have made unprecedented preparations, reporting news of the ship's journey every hour. New York City is now preparing a grand welcome. The British call this ship the Queen of the Ocean. It is expected that the welcome will not be inferior to when the new French ship "Normandie" arrived here last year. At that time, fireboats will spray water into the sky to show welcome. When the new ship enters the port, many ships will be full of spectators, flying flags, and circling around it. There will be airplanes soaring in the sky, and hundreds of ships in the port will sound their horns to show respect. Many people will be standing on the roofs of the major buildings along the New York port, looking into the distance, and newspaper reporters will be standing on the observation deck of the Empire State Building, writing in detail about the grand occasion when the new ship enters the port. After the new ship arrives, at least twelve tugboats will be used to help it dock. If the tide in the Hudson River is unfavorable on that day, then two more tugboats will be added. Although the Hudson River is wide, the procedure for docking such a large ship is quite difficult. There is a lot of ship traffic in the river, and the water depth is about 40 feet, all of which must be carefully noted. The White Star Shipping Company has specially built a new pier for this ship, and has placed a bumper next to the new pier, which is large and strong, and unprecedented, costing about 2,000 pounds. (Reuters Art Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) A Reuters special correspondent on the Queen Mary sent a radio message this morning, saying that the Queen Mary is currently sailing on a slightly rough sea, the weather is gloomy, and everything is smooth. At 12:40 PM, another telegram said that the speed is 28.73 nautical miles per hour. The third telegram said that it is doubtful whether the Atlantic record can be broken unless the average speed is greatly increased. There is now a strong northeasterly wind, the sea is calm, and the sky is clear and cloudy. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>London. The situation in Palestine is now somewhat looser than before. According to a Reuters dispatch from Jerusalem, the police are no longer wearing steel helmets, which is clear evidence that the situation is slightly calmer. There was no sign of ethnic fighting in the city last night, but the authorities remained vigilant everywhere and seized some weapons and ammunition in several villages. According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo, no large numbers of troops were transferred to Palestine today, because the situation there is relatively calmer. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Alexandria, Egypt. Small battles have repeatedly occurred in Jaffa, Palestine, and Jerusalem, and the situation is critical. The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Brigades here have received emergency orders to go there. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem. It was officially announced here today that sporadic small battles have now spread to Jaffa, where Arabs attacked the police, and the police fired back. There were also shootings outside the Jewish settlements in the Emek Hefer valley. The Jewish Peter Teyvah orange packing factory has been burned down by Arabs. Police searched the residences of Arabs and seized a large number of weapons. In the past 24 hours, only one Arab gatekeeper was mistakenly killed by an Arab policeman. Officials deny that any British soldiers were killed, and deny the Cairo news that a large number of Arabs ambushed a British policeman near Gaza. The work of the military and police is now limited to breaking the resistance of the Arabs and preventing attacks on Jewish settlements. The British have today rushed a regiment of troops from Cairo to here. Since the disturbances occurred on April 19, the total number of dead and wounded is about 400. According to the figures released today, one European died and 17 were injured, including 7 British police officers, 2 soldiers, and 8 civilians. 24 Jews died, 22 Muslims died, and only 2 Christians died. Among the injured, there were 182 Muslims, 102 Jews, and 44 Christians. 969 Arabs and 275 Jews were arrested, most of whom violated the curfew.</p>
<p>According to news from Geneva, the League of Nations Mandates Commission held its semi-annual meeting in Geneva yesterday and discussed the mandates of Palestine. The commission re-elected the Italian representative, Cioturri, as chairman. Although Italy has withdrawn from the work of the League of Nations, Cioturri still attended, because the members of the commission are elected based on their personal abilities, and not as representatives of their own governments. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Geneva. The League of Nations Mandates Commission opened its 29th session today, with the Italian representative Cioturri as chairman. Everyone was surprised that the Italian representative attended the meeting this time, because the Italian representative of the Tobacco Prohibition Committee was absent for a week and never participated in the meeting. The agenda of the meeting has two items:</p>
<p>1.  Review the reports of the mandated countries.</p>
<p>2.  Review the majority of petitions, especially the petitions from Palestine and Transjordan, the most important of which is the Jewish immigration issue. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Mussolini Repeatedly Conciliates Britain, but Britain Remains Unmoved</p>
<p>London. Political figures recently stated that financial sanctions against Italy should be maintained, for two reasons. First, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is now planning to organize Abyssinia and develop its resources. Italy's own financial resources are insufficient, so it must borrow from Britain and France to be able to do so. Therefore, the only way to pressure Italy at present is to maintain financial sanctions. Second, people generally believe that the situation in Palestine is now becoming more and more chaotic. Conservative Party members' fear of Italian imperialism has increased, so their attitude towards Italy has also become stronger. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome. Political figures here recently stated that if the current sanctions continue and countries do not recognize Italy's seizure of Abyssinia, then Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations. The Fascist Party's Supreme Council authorized Prime Minister Mussolini in 1934 to announce its withdrawal at any time, but the Prime Minister is unwilling to take this action before the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations on the 16th of next month. Official figures are now closely watching Britain's attitude, believing that Britain's future policy will be one of the following three: 1. Temporarily maintain the status quo. 2. Return to glorious isolationism and ignore the League of Nations. 3. Organize a broad cooperation plan with European countries. If Britain adopts the third policy, then Italy, although it does not intend to take any concrete action, is willing to move closer to Britain and is willing to re-participate in cooperation on various European events. This has been notified to the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Vansittart, by the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi. Political figures believe that if Italy is to re-participate in European events, it would be best to reorganize the League of Nations, especially to abolish Article 16 of the Covenant, which is the clause on sanctions. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini told a reporter from the Daily Telegraph today that Anglo-Italian friendship is not only hoped for, but is also necessary. I will do my best to promote its realization. Anglo-Italian relations in Africa should be corrected, but Italy cannot initiate the signing of the Mediterranean Agreement until the sanctions have been completely lifted. The small countries in the Mediterranean need not fear Italian policy. The Italian army is powerful and does not need to train black troops. I hope that Italy's commercial relations can be resolved satisfactorily. As for the Libyan garrison that has caused Britain unease in the past few months, Mussolini stated that it can be recalled as soon as the British fleet withdraws. British interests in the Tana Lake region must be respected. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>London. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave an interview to Lenox, the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, yesterday. The newspaper recently published an editorial, commenting on this interview, saying, "We sympathize with what the Italian Prime Minister said about the necessity of closer ties between Britain and Italy. In addition, the Italian Prime Minister has another saying that is more important and of more urgent concern, that is, if the current sanctions continue to be implemented for one day, then Italy will not sign the Mediterranean Agreement for one day. Regarding this matter, we believe that the Mediterranean Agreement is now more important to Italy than in the past, because Italy has established a brand new empire in Africa, so for the sake of transportation between Italy's mainland and the empire, it is important that the Suez Canal is free and unmolested. In short, under the current circumstances, no country can force another country to accept a solution in the form of a memorandum. On the contrary, if Italy can uphold the spirit of cooperation and express its willingness to reach an understanding, then all countries related to the Mediterranean will welcome it." (Havas Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway. Foreign Minister Koht recently gave a speech, clarifying Norway's position on the sanctions issue, saying, "The sanctions can only be lifted by a unanimous decision of all countries. How can Norway take unilateral action to break the sanctions front? As far as the League of Nations is concerned, Norway should continue to support it, because the League of Nations is the only international organization that can gradually develop into a genuine tool for maintaining peace. Since we are now maintaining the sanctions policy, the clauses in the League of Nations Covenant regarding the reduction of armaments should also be implemented, and an international army should be formed, so that its strength is sufficient to defeat the military force of any one country."

<p>Turkish Officer Discusses the Defeat of the Abyssinian Army: Internal Discord Was the Main Cause of Defeat</p>
<p>Cairo. Turkish General Vehip Bey, who served as a military advisor under General Nasibu, the commander-in-chief of the southern route of the Abyssinian army, participated in military affairs and made outstanding contributions. Later, because the Abyssinian emperor fled, General Nasibu also left the country. General Vehip Bey also left Abyssinia and came to Egypt. He recently gave an interview to our reporter in Alexandria, recounting the defeat of the Abyssinian army and his own actions, saying that when the Abyssinian emperor fled, I (the general referred to himself) was still commanding military affairs on the Wogadan front. There, the vanguard of the two armies made contact, and the Abyssinian army won successive victories, so the war situation was not completely hopeless. Later, because the Abyssinian emperor left the country, the general situation was over, so I came to Egypt, originally intending to go to Palestine to pay my respects to the Abyssinian emperor. I recently learned that the emperor has gone to Britain, so I gave up. As far as I know, General Nasibu, the commander-in-chief of the southern route of the Abyssinian army, is extremely intelligent and patriotic. His subordinates are also brave and good at fighting. He was truly the last strong force in Abyssinia to resist the powerful enemy. It is a pity that General Nasibu's military experience was not sufficient, and he ultimately failed. The reporter then asked what caused the defeat of the Abyssinian army. He replied that internal discord in Abyssinia was the main cause of the defeat. In addition, the Italian army tried its best to instigate dissension, which further shook the morale of the army. The disparity in armaments was also an important cause of defeat. However, I believe that the Italian planes flew too high, and their effectiveness was not necessarily as expected by the country's military authorities. They were not to be feared. As for poisonous gas, the Italian army did use it in large quantities, especially in the later stages of the war. The Abyssinian army had no protective equipment, so the damage was severe. Even my own eyes were injured. In short, Italian Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio was good at commanding, and the country's troops fought effectively. This is something we greatly admire. However, from a global perspective, the military equipment of the two countries was vastly different. The Italian army's victory was not a military victory, but a military invasion. "I believe that it was absolutely necessary for the Abyssinian emperor to resolutely leave the country." (Havas Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Monks Building a Temple in Xiamen: Awaiting Negotiation by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Regarding the case of Japanese monks purchasing land in Daguan Garden to build a Honganji Temple, the municipal government stated that according to international treaties, foreign religions are only permitted for Christian and Catholic religions to preach. Buddhism was originally indigenous to China, and there is no need for Japanese to propagate it. Moreover, the treaty does not mention the construction of temples by Japanese in our territory. It was not approved. Recently, Japanese monks forcibly moved civilian graves within the boundary, and the municipal government protested. The Japanese consul's attitude was very tough. Finally, the municipal government declared to the Japanese consul that this case would be submitted to the Central Ministry of Foreign Affairs for direct negotiation with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Before the resolution, the Japanese monks are temporarily ordered to stop proceeding. The Japanese consul agreed to comply. (Special Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>The End of the Inland River Merchant Shipping Bureau</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau and the settlement of outstanding debts are addressed, the management of inland river navigation, originally organized as the Inland River Merchant Shipping Bureau and subordinate to the General Bureau, will be dealt with. However, the inland river navigation sector has suffered substantial losses over the years, accumulating debts of over 500,000 yuan to the General Bureau. The General Bureau itself is undergoing active reorganization and cannot easily manage both. To avoid competition with private inland river navigation businesses, it has been decided to abolish the Inland River Bureau. The Ministry of Transportation has ordered the handling of the closure. All closure procedures and the date of abolition will be decided by a shareholders' meeting convened by the China Merchants Bureau. It is expected that operations will cease around July. This meeting will first decide on the issue of equity transfer to repay outstanding debts. The bureau's original fleet of over twenty inland river vessels will be sold separately.

<h3>English Subject Lecture - Talking about Learning English to Middle School Students (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Qixun, Full-time Editor and Reviewer, National Compilation and Translation Bureau</p>
<p>The opportunities and conveniences you now have for learning English are immeasurable compared to what we had in middle school twenty-odd years ago. Now you have excellent textbooks, various extracurricular supplementary reading materials, complete dictionaries, and even excellent teachers. We did not have these opportunities and conveniences back then. When we studied grammar, we even had to memorize definitions one by one, which was so tedious and useless. Our reading books at that time (these kinds of reading books are now out of print) were equivalent to practicing oral translation. When the teacher went to the classroom, he would open the reading book and translate it into Chinese sentence by sentence until the end of the class. The next time he went to class, he would first have one or two students orally translate several paragraphs of the previous lesson in the same way, and then he would continue translating himself. Just imagine, how could our English teachers back then be compared to your English teachers now?</p>
<p>Now, from junior high school to high school graduation, there are a total of six years, with five hours of English each week. The time spent learning cannot be said to be short. If you can study diligently, your English grades will definitely be several times better than ours when we graduated from middle school. You should work even harder. However, we have serious doubts as to whether the English level of current junior and senior high school students is satisfactory. I have a relative who has graduated from high school. When he comes to see me sometimes, I casually say a few very common English sentences to him, but he stares blankly and doesn't know how to answer. Sometimes I open his textbook and ask him to read a paragraph to me, but his pronunciation is very stiff, and he hardly distinguishes between stressed and unstressed sounds. I can barely understand nine out of ten sentences. This surprises me quite a bit. I think perhaps my relative is of poor quality, or perhaps his English foundation was weak in junior high school, and it is an exception that cannot be generalized. But then I thought that the number of middle school students like my relative is probably not small. If this is true, then even with all the conveniences available for learning English today, their grades are still like this, which is really unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>I think the main reason for their poor English grades is that their learning methods are incorrect. There are many learning methods for English, and I can only briefly talk about the basic methods with you now. Your teachers must have told you these methods, and I originally didn't need to say much, but I am deeply afraid that you will put them aside and not use them when you are reading idioms, memorizing new words, and analyzing sentences. So today I especially bring them up to talk about. What I want to talk about is the method of learning English, which is the pronunciation of English.</p>
<p>Methods of learning English</p>
<p>Learning can be divided into two types: scientific and artistic. Scientific learning is mostly based on thought and experimentation; artistic learning is mostly based on muscle training and skill. Learning English belongs to the artistic type because it relies entirely on the training of the mouth, ears, eyes, and hands. According to the research of foreign linguists, there is a fixed and unchangeable method for learning a language. Children must follow this method when they begin to learn a foreign language in order to be effective. There are three main methods for learning English, which are described below:</p>
<p>Ear training</p>
<p>Oral imitation and proficiency Mechanizing</p>
<p>Composition by analogy. Let me explain them separately.</p>
<p>The first thing to rely on when learning English is our two ears. If there is something wrong with the ears, English will definitely not be learned well. Therefore, the first one or two months of the first semester of junior high school should focus entirely on ear training. When students first learn English, they rarely use their eyes, except when observing the teacher's mouth and tongue movements. At this stage, students must first be able to "understand meaning by hearing sounds" and then be able to "distinguish sounds by hearing." Mr. Zhang Shiyi, who is well-versed in English teaching methods, has always advocated this. We must first listen clearly to the pronunciation of a word before we can say it. To learn an English sentence, we must first listen clearly to this sentence. This is an unbreakable principle. The so-called direct teaching method is based on this principle. The biggest mistake in teaching English in the past was to start teaching students to recognize and spell words, to read and make sentences, without first teaching students to listen with their ears. The result was of course not good. In short, the teacher should speak as much simple English as possible to the students in the classroom. If the students don't understand, they can use objects, pictures, or actions to convey the meaning. If objects, pictures, and actions are difficult to convey the meaning, it is also possible to use Chinese occasionally, but the less the better. This should be done not only in the classroom, but also outside the classroom. We should often speak English to the students, which is the best way to train the ears. You as students should know the importance of ear training. You should pay attention to the pronunciation of the English teachers in the classroom and often practice. The pronunciation will naturally improve day by day. For example, He came. He comeg Has he come He has not Did be come He didn't come. Docs come He doe 't come. etc., the sentences are clear at a glance and very easy. In fact, it is common to make mistakes when you have to say them on the spot. This requires a lot of practice to reach a proficient level. Other English idioms and sentences must be practiced in this way. This is the first method.</p>
<p>The second method of learning a language is oral imitation. We know that children learn to imitate adults' speech very early, which shows that babbling is a child's instinct. A large part of learning English also lies in imitation. The more you imitate, the higher your English will be. Hearing and oral imitation are like the two wheels of a car, which complement each other. We must imitate a sentence after hearing the teacher say it. We should also practice it often so that we will not forget it and can reach a proficient level. For example, for sentences with negative meaning, we often hear the teacher say Don't………, to indicate what to do, we often hear the teacher use Let's…… We should often imitate them after hearing them. However, the most important thing about oral imitation is not the usage of words, but the light and heavy, fast and slow rhythm of grammar. This can be called "intonation." If the English intonation is wrong, even if the grammar is correct, it will not sound good. Currently, most people who compile English textbooks have adopted the International Phonetic Alphabet for pronunciation, but few people pay attention to intonation, which is a shortcoming. I have another suggestion for intonation: middle school teachers should quickly adopt English phonograph records. As far as I know, there are three types of phonograph records for teaching English: (1) compiled by Mr. Lin Yutang and pronounced by D. Jones (Kaiming Bookstore), (2) compiled by Palmer (English Research Institute of the Japanese Ministry of Education), and (3) compiled by the China Book Company. Among them, the one compiled by Palmer is the best and most complete. There are many grammatical usages in English: such as Asif as tbough not at all never mind thankstbank you so much, Wbat next, I wonder! I think so too I do bope yon can come Tbere'ssome thing I want to know! Is there some thing to drink I hope you've got some moneyon you I haven' etc., there are countless examples. When speaking, there are light and heavy, fast and slow rhythms. The teacher can have the students imitate orally on the one hand, and often have them listen to English phonograph records on the other hand. This can not only arouse their interest in speaking English, but also make them happy to imitate. With practice over time, they will naturally become proficient and can speak fluently without having to think in advance. We know that a person who can play the piano well can play a tune and talk to friends at the same time, which means that his piano playing skills are already proficient. To speak English fluently, you must also do this. This is the second method.</p>

<h3>Korean Rascals Smuggling Silver Again in North China</h3>
<p>Several Batches Have Left the Customs, Future Activities Inevitable—Tianjin Correspondence, May 25th, Continental Daily News: After a period of relative quiet over the past three or four months, Tianjin customs officials now report that Koreans are once again engaged in smuggling silver in North China. In recent days, Koreans have transported several large batches of silver out of Tianjin by train through Shanhaiguan. It is expected that their activities will increase further in the next two or three weeks. Last night, the Tianjin Customs anti-smuggling team seized 12,000 silver dollars on the Japanese ship Chosen Maru, bound for Dalian. Customs officials were informed that a Korean was carrying a large number of silver dollars on board. Customs officials boarded the ship to search him, but he fled down the gangway into the French Concession. However, he was intercepted by the French police. When customs officials arrived, they found 400 silver dollars on his person. As the Chosen Maru had already cast off and was sailing, Koreans continued to board the ship. Customs officials, knowing that they must also be smuggling silver, ordered the Tanggu anti-smuggling team to board the ship and search the Korean passengers, seizing a total of 11,000 silver dollars. Both of these incidents were quickly learned by the Japanese police, who dispatched Japanese police officers to the Chosen Maru to observe the customs officials' search, but did not voice any protest. This is the first time that the Tianjin Customs has seized a large batch of smuggled silver, but it is feared that a continuous stream of smugglers will follow. It was reported last night that a group of Koreans, carrying 62,000 silver dollars, were preparing to depart from Beiping for Shanhaiguan at any moment. Due to the many difficulties faced by Chinese authorities and anti-smuggling teams in conducting searches, it seems not difficult to transport the silver out of the city. Several months ago, smugglers could only transport contraband out of China by detouring or using secret methods. The most reliable method was to throw the silver over the city wall at Shanhaiguan, where accomplices would pick it up and leave. Since the Japanese army at Shanhaiguan disarmed the Chinese Customs anti-smuggling team, smugglers have been able to enter and exit without fear. Smugglers now only need to exit the Tianjin area to be free from danger. They often travel in groups, capable of resisting searches by railway police and customs anti-smuggling teams. However, customs officials at Tianjin are still doing their utmost to search for smugglers on ships and trains. However, Koreans are unusually violent, and searches in Tianjin are becoming increasingly difficult. In recent weeks, they have openly fought with customs officials at the slightest provocation. This is evidenced by an incident that occurred last night at the Tianjin East Railway Station. The customs anti-smuggling team, having heard that a large quantity of rayon was being loaded onto a train bound for Beiping, dispatched ten officers to the East Station to arrest the smugglers. Upon arrival, they found several thousand Koreans holding clubs and bricks, refusing to allow them to board the train. The anti-smuggling team, seeing that they were outnumbered, exercised restraint and retreated. The Koreans then affixed seals to the freight cars containing the rayon and left them on the platform until the train departed. Such incidents occur almost daily. The customs anti-smuggling team can only stand by helplessly, with no means of dealing with them.</p>

It is reported that the authorities plan to continue negotiations with Japanese representative Kozo Matsumuro at the beginning of next month. After the newly appointed commander of the Japanese garrison army, Tadashi, took office, he convened a staff meeting to discuss policy towards North China. He is expected to visit Song Zheyuan in Beiping at the end of this month. In addition to routine courtesies, diplomatic issues may be discussed informally. Because he is awaiting Tadashi, Song has postponed his planned tour. It is reported that the authorities' attitude towards diplomatic issues is that they would be happy to seek a solution if the Japanese side can negotiate in good faith. Otherwise, it is better to let things take their natural course.</p>
<p>Within Hebei-Chahar, Chairman Song has recent plans for improvement, and senior staff members have been meeting frequently to discuss them. The position of Chief of Staff of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters, vacated after the dismissal of Shi Jingting, has been concurrently held by Zhang Yueting, Chief of Staff of the 29th Army. Therefore, the general situation is still good, and there is unlikely to be any major change.</p>
<p>The situation in Inner Mongolia is unclear. Leading figures of the Bailingmiao Mongolian Political Council were summoned by Prince De to Huade County in Chahar Province to hold a meeting and make decisions. The most important decision was to conscript all Mongolian lamas between the ages of 16 and 40 into military service. Another decision was to have all Mongolians cut off their queues to demonstrate their revolutionary and reformist intentions. Prince De also sent his brother, Bao Shushen, to Tianjin to negotiate, hoping to establish a national base on the border between Inner Mongolia and Chahar-Suiyuan. After arriving in Tianjin, Bao immediately recruited troops from Yan Dongwu and Wang Ying, among others. Bao's residence is located at No. 3 Hongde Lane in the Japanese Concession, which is also noteworthy. (26th)</p>
<h3>Smuggling is Active, Resulting in Losses to the Jiaohai Customs</h3>
<p>Losses Amount to Ten Million Yuan Since Last August Qingdao Communication: Since the issue of smuggling in North China arose, the losses suffered by our country's customs duties have been extremely significant. In the Jiaohai Customs area alone, the losses have reached a staggering ten million yuan. According to sources within the customs, prior to August of the 24th year (1935), smuggling in the North China region was primarily a matter of tax evasion (with the risk of detention and penalties if discovered by the customs), so it was not given much attention. However, after customs' anti-smuggling efforts in eastern Hebei were interfered with by a certain party, smuggling vessels on the sea became fearless, and armed smuggling groups were organized on land, openly resisting the payment of customs duties. This led to increasingly rampant smuggling in North China, causing such severe losses in national revenue. However, at present, smuggling in North China is entirely of a tax-resistance nature, only feasible in the special zone of eastern Hebei, and has not yet extended to the Jiaohai Customs area. Nevertheless, the indirect losses in national revenue suffered since August of last year to date have approached ten million yuan. A breakdown of the losses suffered by each major imported commodity is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rayon: The annual sales of rayon in the Zhucun and Weixian areas of Shandong Province are approximately five million pounds (equivalent to 500,000 small packages). Of these, those imported through Qingdao with taxes paid account for half, generating a monthly revenue of over 200,000 yuan. The main importer is Rihua Silk Factory. Before August of last year, an average of over 200,000 pounds of goods could be received each month. Due to the impact of smuggling in North China, smuggled goods have been continuously transported from Tianjin and Jinan to Zhucun, Weixian, and other places. Rihua Silk Factory has now been forced to suspend operations. As a result of this, tax revenues have suffered a loss of 2 million yuan from August of last year to the end of April this year.</p>
<p>White Sugar: Before August of last year, an average of 30,000 bags of white sugar (each bag weighing 81 kilograms) were imported through Qingdao with taxes paid, sold along the Jiaoji and Longhai railway lines (with a tax of 15 yuan per bag). The main importer was Mitsui &amp; Co. Since September of last year, imports have been suspended, resulting in a tax revenue loss of approximately 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cigarette Paper: The customs duties on cigarette paper are several times higher than the cost, and there are also restrictions imposed by the Consolidated Tax Bureau's import permits. Previously, most imports were smuggled goods, and the customs has no accurate statistics. However, due to the impact of smuggling in North China, the national tax revenue loss is estimated to be over one million yuan.</p>
<p>Other Piece Goods and All Other High-Tax Commodities: Due to high costs, limited sales, and low profits, although a large amount of smuggled goods are imported into eastern Hebei, they have not yet been dumped into the Jiaodong area. However, Lu Xi and Henan have stopped purchasing goods from Qingdao, and customs import tax revenues have also suffered extremely large losses, estimated at over one million yuan. In total, the losses from the above items amount to nearly ten million yuan. How the situation will develop in the future is difficult to predict. Although the customs has been strictly investigating and striving to stop it, there are many constraints, and the results are minimal.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Anhui Section of the Nine-Province Telephone Trunk Line</h3>
<p>Wuhu and Anqing to Trial Calls at the End of the Month Wuhu Communication: The pole and wire construction for the Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone project within Anhui Province, led by engineer Li Guohua dispatched by the Ministry of Communications, has been underway for quite some time. The project is divided into trunk and branch lines. The trunk line project is divided into three sections: 1. Nanjing to Wuhu; 2. Wuhu to Anqing; 3. Anqing to Jiujiang. The Nanjing-Wuhu section has been completed and is already in operation, with the original telephone line converted into the Wuhu-Dangtu long-distance telephone. The Wuhu-Anqing section has also been erected to Gu Jia Hui Town, which belongs to Guichi County. This town has a central telephone exchange, and future calls between Beijing and Hankou must be relayed through this location. Although Gu Town is only a short distance from Anqing, it is separated by a river. A submarine cable has been laid from Qianjiangkou to connect the two places, so it has been decided that this section will be tested at the end of this month. The Anqing-Jiujiang section has also been fully erected recently. The trunk line project within Anhui Province has thus been largely completed as a whole. In addition to the Wuhu-Tunxi branch line, which officially opened last month, the Wuhu-Qimen line has also been completed, with extremely satisfactory trial call results. According to the original plan of the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction for the distribution of long-distance telephones throughout the province, more than fifty counties are currently connected and in operation. In the 25th year (1936), the long-distance telephone network will be completed according to the following plan: 1. Anqing, the seat of the provincial government, will have direct telephone connections with the ten special commissioner's offices of Taihu, Wuhu, Luan, Shouxian, Chuxian, Sixian, Fuyang, Guichi, Xuancheng, and Xiuning; 2. The provincial government will have direct telephone connections with all counties; 3. Special commissioner's offices will be able to communicate with each other; 4. Special commissioner's offices will be able to communicate directly with all counties under their jurisdiction; 5. Neighboring counties will be able to communicate with each other. At the same time, the non-wired telecommunications network is also actively being developed. Of the 62 counties in the province that have not yet established wireless radio stations, only 22 counties, including Dingyuan, Susong, and Wangjiang, remain. It is planned to establish these stations within the 25th year's construction plan, and several five-watt DC transceiver sets have been ordered from Shanghai electrical appliance manufacturers for application.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Agricultural College Exhibition Divided into Four Major Departments</h3>
<p>Funding Provided by the National Economic Council and the Provincial Government; Aimed at Aiding and Improving Agriculture Nanchang Communication: Jiangxi is an important agricultural region in the Yangtze River Basin, with approximately 40 million mu of arable land and a population of 20 million, of which farmers account for more than 80%. In recent years, due to natural disasters, man-made calamities, and foreign economic aggression, the old-fashioned agriculture has been collapsing. Coupled with the spread of the Red Scourge, burning, killing, and looting for nine years, the collapsing agriculture has become like eggs in a broken nest. To aid and improve agriculture, the provincial government passed a resolution on July 14, 1933, to establish an Agricultural College, with Zou Bingwen, Hu Xianxiu, Xiong Shihui, and others serving as members of the board of directors, and the board of directors appointed Dong Shijin as the president. The annual funding is 250,000 yuan, and the establishment fee is 330,000 yuan. It was officially established on April 21, 1934. Its characteristics are: All agricultural agencies in the province are under its control; Research and promotion go hand in hand, with the promotion department acting as a link; There is administrative contact with each administrative inspectorate district and county government; It is directly under the provincial government, and its administration is not delayed by other agencies; Its directly administered agencies are located throughout the province; Demonstration and experimental farms are established in each specialty center to serve as promotion centers. The establishment fee of 200,000 yuan was allocated by the National Economic Council, and 130,000 yuan was allocated by the Jiangxi Provincial Government. The college site is located in Liantang, 14 kilometers from the city, with rice paddies, orchards, nurseries, and houses occupying a thousand mu, costing more than 40,000 yuan for land prices and 150,000 to 160,000 yuan for construction costs. In terms of equipment, all are new-style. The instruments for the crop group are worth more than 2,700 yuan, the horticulture group more than 1,400 yuan, the chemistry group more than 4,700 yuan, the entomology group more than 3,700 yuan, the agricultural implement group more than 22,000 yuan, the animal husbandry group more than 10,000 yuan, the veterinary medicine group more than 11,000 yuan, the forestry department more than 1,900 yuan, and the promotion department more than 2,800 yuan. In addition, breeding livestock purchased from overseas and various locations cost a total of 14,000 yuan. The 21st of this month is the college's second anniversary, so a commemorative meeting, an agricultural product exhibition, and an agricultural discussion meeting were held. At 9:00 a.m. that morning, the opening ceremony was held in the college's auditorium, attended by members of the provincial government, hall directors, Zhang Fuliang of the National Economic Council's Jiangxi office, representatives from the eight administrative districts, county magistrates from Jiujiang, Yiyang, Nancheng, and Linchuan, and senior officials of the college, totaling several hundred people. The college president, Dong Shijin, presided over the meeting, reporting on the purpose of the meeting and the establishment of the college. This was followed by speeches by Provincial Government Committee Member Xiao and others. The ceremony concluded and adjourned at 11:00 a.m. In the afternoon, a tour was held. In terms of the college's administration, the board of directors is directly under the provincial government. Under the president, in addition to the general affairs office, there are four major departments: agronomy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, forestry, and promotion. A summary of their current status is as follows:</p>
<p>The Agronomy Department is divided into four groups: Crop Group: Established the Nangankou and Liantang Rice Cultivation Experimental Farms, conducting breeding experiments on various rice species from home and abroad. Pure strains of early, mid, and late-season rice are being continuously tested, with approximately 50 promising varieties that will be promoted in the future. The department considers the Nanxun Road area of northern Jiangxi to be the province's cotton production center, so a cotton experimental farm was established in Yongxiu to improve varieties and promote American cotton. Guangjue's tobacco leaves are the most abundant and best in the province, suitable for making cigarettes, with an annual output of several million yuan. However, it is gradually declining, so a tobacco farm was specially established. Xiushui is the center of black tea production, with annual sales to Russia of several million yuan in previous years, but it has recently plummeted. A tea farm has also been newly established to serve as a demonstration of planting and manufacturing. Horticulture Group: As the Liantang site is insufficient for expansion, a fruit tree garden was established in Lehua to collect and cultivate good varieties from home and abroad. As it has only been one year, it is difficult to judge the results. Among the province's fruits, Nanfeng tangerines are the most famous, with an annual output of 100,000 dan, priced at 2 jiao per jin, being the county's only source of wealth. Recently, it has been devastated by bandits, and it is in a terrible state, so an experimental farm was specially established here to improve it. Although the yield of Sanhu tangerines in Xingan is high, the varieties are poor, so the Sanhu Orchard was established, and citrus juice is made to seek new outlets. Entomology Group: Actively engaged in the capture and research of various types of insect pests of agricultural crops and horticulture. When insect pests occur in various places, personnel are temporarily dispatched to prevent and control them. The insect pest control instructors in each county are under their direct command. Agronomy Chemistry: Established a chemical laboratory in the college for soil, fertilizer, and food analysis, as well as the manufacture of sugar and agricultural medicines.</p>
<p>The Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine Department is divided into two groups: Animal Husbandry: Established an animal husbandry general farm within the college, purchasing pure breeds of various livestock from abroad for further breeding and promotion to various places. In addition to establishing a sheep farm in Yichun and a bee farm in Sanhu, it is also planned to establish a horse farm in Xingzi County, at the foot of Mount Lu, but it has not been realized due to limited funding. Veterinary Medicine Group: This work is extremely important, as veterinary medicine is underdeveloped in our country. When plagues occur in pigs, cattle, horses, etc., the livestock in entire villages and townships die out. The most important work of this group is the distribution of veterinary epidemic types, livestock epidemic prevention administration, and popularization. The college has already purchased and applied instruments for bacterial parasitic animal serum vaccines, such as electric serum, separators, autoclaves, and electric precipitators. In addition, a model animal epidemic prevention zone has been established in Linchuan, and in addition to the general area, a model epidemic prevention county has been established in each administrative area, with the aim of extending to each county. Epidemic prevention and treatment centers have also been established in Chongren, Yihuang, Dongxiang, Jinxi, and Nancheng, and the promotion of clean livestock sheds and working cattle insurance, etc. However, when plagues occur temporarily in various places, personnel are temporarily dispatched to prevent and control them, regardless of time and space.</p>
<p>According to the Agricultural College's estimate, arable land in the province accounts for only 14% of the total area, with the rest being mostly barren mountains, which are most suitable for forestry. In addition to the provincial government ordering each county, district, and joint security organization to establish nurseries, the Agricultural College also directly operates a central nursery in Guixi, Wanzai, Ji'an, Nancheng, Ganxian, Wuning, and Ningdu, which are located in suitable locations, to supply seedlings to various places. For the study of forestry academics, there is the specimen forest in the college and the Peach Hill Educational Forest for observation and inspiration. The most valuable in terms of academics is the Lushan Botanical Garden, which is co-operated with the Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute of Beiping and is the only one in the country.</p>
<p>The Promotion Department is the link between research and implementation, promoting and popularizing what has been obtained and what should be reformed. In addition to the county government technicians, the lower-level cadres for promotion include the rural service areas of Linchuan, Nancheng, Qicheng, Xingan, Gao'an, Yongxiu, the suburbs of Nancheng, Ji'an, Shangrao, and Yudu, which are run by the National Economic Council, and the rural normal schools of Jiujiang, Yichun, and Guixi, which serve as promotion centers for nearby counties. At the same time, it is planned to establish a promotion office in each of the eight administrative inspection districts in the province for the promotion of agricultural affairs (May 23).</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Li Genyuan Sues Again After Abandoning His Concubine</h3>
<p>Li Genyuan, former Prime Minister of the State Council, has resided in Suzhou for many years. Three years ago, he and his abandoned concubine, Ms. Cheng Peiyi, mutually accused each other of obstructing freedom. Cheng Peiyi filed a lawsuit with the Wudi Court, requesting alimony. After litigating for a year without results, it ended without a conclusion. Recently, Cheng Peiyi has again commissioned lawyer Zou Shengzu in Shanghai to file a lawsuit with the Wudi Court, requesting Li Genyuan to pay her 10,000 yuan in alimony. It is heard that someone is mediating in the matter, hoping that it will not lead to litigation.</p>
<h3>The Rent Riot Has Not Yet Subsided</h3>
<p>Farmers in the Suzhou villages of Chefang, Xietang, and Guoxiang have launched rent riots multiple times this month, often gathering crowds of one or two thousand people with considerable momentum, even leading to conflicts with security teams. Although the police have suppressed them as needed, no serious disputes have occurred. However, there has been no improvement in rent collection. Although the county government has lenient rent reduction measures, they have had little effect, causing general landowners and brokers to worry deeply. Unexpectedly, a small rent riot occurred again in the Xietang countryside a few days ago, fortunately without escalating. News came that in Chenjiawan, Chefang village, on the night of the 27th, around 8:00 p.m., two to three hundred villagers gathered to riot over rent, intending to petition the district office. After Officer Zhou of the village's public security sub-station led the police to the scene to dissuade them, they dispersed without causing trouble. Two villagers who were arrested at the time were taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>The construction of the Suzhou-Pingwang section of the Suzhou-Fuyang Highway (between Suzhou and Mudu) was completed last year, and public buses are operating, with very prosperous business. Therefore, approval was obtained from the Department of Construction to continue building the Mudu-Guangfu section (i.e., Mudu to Guangfu), which is 24 li long. Since the start of construction, the project has progressed very quickly and will be completed within the month. In July, the entire road can be opened to traffic. At the same time, the construction of the Guangfu-Wangting section of the highway is being planned to complete the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway. The Department of Construction is currently planning this. In addition, the Mudu-Tianpingshan Highway, which is nine li long, is being built. The mountain is one of the famous scenic spots in Wuxian, with natural scenery. However, due to inconvenient transportation, tourists are not very developed. Currently, local gentry Jiang Zhongchuan and others have initiated the construction of a branch road, named Jingfan Road, following the Suzhou-Fuyang Highway method, with merchants investing in the construction, with a capital of 20,000 yuan. It is currently being prepared and will soon become a reality. There is also the Pinghu Highway (Pingwang to Huzhou in Zhejiang), a branch of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Highway, which is 100 li long. The Zhejiang Construction Department is responsible for the construction, which has been completed and will be opened to traffic on June 1.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Soil Bank Manager Detained</h3>
<p>Gao Baozhen, manager of the Xinji soil bank outside the South Gate, once served as the captain of the county's public security team and acting director of the county's public security bureau. Someone secretly reported to the Songjiang Commissioner's Office that the soil cream sold by the bank on weekdays was priced using the canal scale, but the weight delivered was based on the market scale, with a difference of 2.4 qian per tael, resulting in a large amount of illegal income. Commissioner Wang, based on the report, dispatched Section Chief Jia Zongfu of the Second Section to Jiading on the 26th. After arriving at the county government, he ordered Gao to come for questioning and immediately handed him over to the county government for detention. He was asked to pay a bail of 50,000 yuan, but he has not been released to date.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Loan Repayment Period for Cocoon Collection Extended</h3>
<p>The Jiang-Zhe Spring Cocoon Collection Loan Syndicate originally set the deadline for loan disbursement in Jiangsu Province as the 25th. However, according to Tan Qi, the person in charge of the Wuxi branch office, this year's cold weather has delayed the cocoon season in Wuxi. The orchid firms will have to open scales on the 5th of next month, and Suzhou will also have to collect cocoons on the 1st or 2nd of next month. Therefore, the loan repayment period has also been decided to be extended by several days. It is heard that the applicants for loans in Jiangsu Province are more enthusiastic than those in Zhejiang Province, with a total of more than 40 factories and a total loan amount of 6 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Foundry Workers' Strike Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>The machine foundry workers in the city have launched a strike. It is learned that on the 27th, more than a hundred workers went to the county party headquarters to request relief. The county party headquarters advised the workers to go back first and wait for mediation. Around 5:00 p.m., the General Labor Union dispatched Tang Qiuquan to the Foundry Industry Guild in Qian Taiping Lane to convene talks between labor and management. Qian Chunsheng, Xue Genfu, Pan Wenda, and four others from the labor side attended, and Wu Peilin and Zhou Jugen from the management side attended. Tang advised both parties to prioritize the local area and not take extreme measures. The labor side put forward conditions, demanding that the 24 laid-off workers be given at least one month's salary each. However, the management only agreed to give 30%, so no results were achieved. After Tang persuaded both parties, each made slight concessions until around 11:00 p.m., when the following solutions were agreed upon: The 24 dismissed workers will not be reinstated for the time being. The management will pay half a month's salary, and all the foundry workers working in the factory will contribute one day's salary to be distributed to the laid-off workers. In the future, if there is a shortage of work, workers in each factory must work in shifts, but meals will be at their own expense. The factory may not lay off workers without reason. At that time, both labor and management agreed. At 7:00 a.m. on the 28th, some of the foundry workers had already resumed work. The rest of the workers were allowed to resume work uniformly on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Changshu: A Large Batch of Factory Cloth Seized</h3>
<p>The cloth produced by the cloth factories in the county has always been sold to other places in large quantities. However, after the tax inspection station in Nanwai was closed at the end of March, the factory cloth here was once stranded, causing a huge impact. After representatives from Shanghai and Changshu once negotiated with the Consolidated Tax Department, new measures were formulated. Unexpectedly, 106 pieces of cloth produced by the county's factories the other day were suddenly seized by the Shanghai Inspection Station for non-compliance with procedures. The Shanghai Machine Dyeing and Weaving Association, together with representatives from the county, Wang Guanqin and Deng Lanxi, are negotiating with the Consolidated Tax Department, requesting the return of the cloth and the establishment of transportation procedures.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Mining of Changshan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>The demand for coal in Hangzhou has suddenly increased in recent years, but the sources are scarce, and the supply cannot meet the demand, resulting in a coal shortage. The coal industry has specially jointly petitioned the Department of Construction and the municipal government for relief. After the authorities sent personnel to the Changxing coal mine to investigate, it was found that there was no surplus coal available for supply. Later, a coal mine was discovered ten li from the city in Changshan County, eastern Zhejiang. Personnel were sent to investigate in detail and test the coal quality. It is said that the quality is far better than that of Changxing coal. The total reserves in that area are estimated at 400,000 tons. The Department of Construction has decided to invest in mining using local methods in an extremely economical manner. First, a well will be dug, and it is estimated that 4,000 tons of coal can be produced per month, using waterway transportation, with lower costs. Supplying Hangzhou's needs is more than sufficient, and the coal shortage can be completely resolved.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Cocoon Prices Should Result in Detention</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon and Silk Control Association, upon the order of Huang Shaoxiong, chairman of the provincial government, stipulated that when cocoon merchants request the export of local dry cocoons, the local cocoon collection office should verify the price of fresh local cocoons purchased. If the price is below 21 yuan per dan, 40% of the dry cocoons collected should be detained, and sample cocoons should be taken, 10 jin per batch, sealed, tested for silk reeling yield, and double penalties should be imposed. The county magistrates were also instructed by telegram to assist in the handling of the matter.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Eight Bandits Executed</h3>
<p>Bandits Shi Youcai, Zhuang Manlai, and others robbed the homes of Wang Zhongming and Liu Zhengcai, the Putuo Yu Gangtang, and the Piao Ao Huiyang Temple, and injured people. The crimes piled up. After the county government dispatched police to Shanghai and within the county to arrest them, they were all clearly interrogated, and their execution was approved by the superiors and carried out together by shooting.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Lake Society Committee</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Upon investigation, the article "The Life of Silkworm Farmers in the Lake Region of Zhejiang" in the "Rural Life Talks" column of your newspaper on the 16th of this month is quite inaccurate. We hereby correct the errors as follows: 1. The so-called "popular folk songs" "three coarse cotton papers" "going to Shanghai to pull a rickshaw" mentioned in the original article do not exist in the Lake region. This is because the rice paddies in the Lake region are not converted to growing melons, and because farmers in the Lake region have never been found to be pulling rickshaws anywhere. Upon close examination of the lyrics, they seem to be in the style of farmers in Chongming, Jiangsu, but we dare not be certain. 2. The section recorded in Section 4 of the original article, "add one coin, sell green mulberry leaves, truly living off next year's harvest," is merely a phenomenon of a small number of farmers. Even in various counties and towns, it is inevitable that there will be bad people engaging in this "heavy interest exploitation," but it is not as serious as reported. 3. The silkworm raising situation of the farmers recorded in Section 5 of the original article is a past fact. Now, in various villages, silkworm raising is widely guided by instructors dispatched by the Zhejiang Construction Department. As for silkworm eggs, they are all produced and sold by the Zhejiang Construction Department, which is the so-called improved variety. This year, the Wuxing Electric Light Company has also promoted the use of electricity for silkworm raising, and the test results are very good. In recent years, the methods of silkworm raising by farmers in the Lake region have improved a lot, so this year's silkworm news, despite the abnormal weather, still has a good harvest. In addition, the Lake region has always been a silk production area, and there is more mulberry land than rice fields. In addition to sending the above situation to Mr. Yu Qingtang for revision, we earnestly request that you grant us a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, The Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Chairman of the Lake Society Committee, Chen Qicai, May 28th.</p>

<h3>Sea Yuan Steamer Discovers Smuggling Ship on the High Seas</h3>
<p>Smuggling by Sailboat: Customs Patrol Boats on Alert. In Shanghai, some private goods are recently being smuggled in, mostly using sailboats for transport. They secretly unload goods on coasts that are difficult to patrol, or transfer them to designated barges and fishing boats to sneak into the mainland. This was discovered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Yuan steamer, which was returning to Shanghai from Nanhua. En route, it encountered rough seas southwest of Catellated Rock, 14 nautical miles away. The seas then calmed down, and the ship proceeded as usual. As it approached the South Channel, the Hai Yuan spotted a large sailboat fully loaded with thousands of pieces of smuggled goods, sailing on the sea. Upon seeing this, the Hai Yuan immediately sent a wireless telegram to the Shanghai China Merchants General Bureau, reporting the discovery of the large smuggling sailboat, fully loaded with smuggled goods and its location and direction, so that Shanghai could be forewarned and prevent its entry. The Jianghai Customs also received this report and dispatched patrol boats yesterday to search the sea for smuggled goods.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's "May 30th" Memorial</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to Issue Subsidiary Currency Notes</h3>
<p>Shanghai Branch Ordered to Add Five Agricultural Warehouses; Seed Loan Exceeds Three Million. The business of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank has been growing year by year. Its branches and warehouses are located in counties throughout the province. According to the annual business report for the past year, the increase in the amount is significant. To facilitate financial circulation in various counties, the bank will issue three million yuan in subsidiary currency notes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Total Business Volume Last Year. Due to the bank's business development in recent years, the number of branches and offices has reached more than 60, spreading across major cities and towns north and south of the Yangtze River in the province. Its business involves using savings deposits to handle agricultural warehouse storage and seed loans. According to the report, the total amount of deposits and savings is 71,496,424 yuan, and the remaining balance of deposits and savings is 12,453,373 yuan, an increase of onefold compared to the previous year. Compared to the 22nd year, it is a ratio of 6 to 1, showing the speed of development. The total amount of loans is more than 24,700,000 yuan, and the remaining balance at the end of December is more than 9,168,000 yuan. Among them, the seed loan for cooperatives is more than 1,547,000 yuan, and the agricultural warehouse storage mortgage is more than 3,009,000 yuan. Other cooperative sales, agricultural product loans, and remittances total more than 3,000,000 yuan, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Storage and Loan Situation. As the bank's agricultural warehouse storage mortgage loans occupy an important position, the construction of warehouses and the amount of investment are significant. There are currently ten provincial warehouses and sixty-five county warehouses in Jiangsu Province. The bank independently operates fifty-six agricultural warehouses, jointly operates fifty-eight agricultural warehouses, and has twenty-three cooperative agricultural warehouses, distributed in forty counties throughout the province. The estimated capacity can store about three million shi of grain, worth six to seven million yuan. The Shanghai branch has been ordered to add multiple agricultural warehouses, including one provincial warehouse in Zhoupu, Nanhui, and four county warehouses in Datuan, Nanhui, Xiaowan, Chuansha, Nanqiao, Fengxian, and Qingcungang. The aforementioned counties are the main cotton-producing areas, so the focus will be on cotton storage mortgages. The estimated provincial warehouse can store six to seven hundred thousand dan, and the county warehouse can store one hundred thousand dan. However, the existing warehouses in various places also accept rural by-products, such as local native cloth and other specialties.</p>
<p>Overview of Seed Loans. Seed loans are also one of the bank's main businesses, using cooperatives as a model to provide loans to farmers. In addition to cash, there are also loans in kind, such as fertilizers, seeds, and plowing cattle. The bank approves farmers' requests and purchases them on their behalf, then distributes them to farmers. The number of loan cooperatives in the past year, excluding the 1,239 cooperatives with outstanding balances from the 23rd year, is 1,691 cooperatives. The loan amount is 1,682,868 yuan, and the loan counties reach 57 counties. The total amount of seed loans for this year is set at six million yuan, and more than three million yuan are currently being released successively.</p>
<p>Increased Issuance of Subsidiary Currency Notes. To facilitate the flow of finance in various places, the bank has received approval from the Ministry of Finance to issue three million yuan in subsidiary currency notes. The old models of the Xuzhou and Pingshi Official Money Bureaus are used, with the bank's name added. They are divided into three types: one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao. The China Bookstore and other companies have been commissioned to print them, and a portion has been delivered and sent to the Zhenjiang General Office. It is expected that the bank and the Jiangsu Bank will issue and circulate them at the beginning of next month. As for the required guarantee reserves, 60% in cash and 40% in securities, will be deposited in the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Inspector Booker Returns to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Collecting Materials on the Impact of Smuggling on American Businesses. Dr. Booker, the US Treasury Inspector stationed in China, flew from Beijing to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 26th to collect materials on the impact of smuggled goods on American businesses and to liaise with the financial commissioner's office of the US Embassy in Shanghai. It has been learned that Mr. Booker only stayed in Shanghai for one day and flew back to Beijing yesterday morning. He will come to Shanghai again. Mr. Booker's mission is roughly the same as that of Sir Leith-Ross, the British economic expert, representing US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.</p>
<h3>This Year's Spring Silkworm Cocoon Harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Is Bountiful</h3>
<p>The Banking Syndicate Decides to Handle Cocoon Purchasing Loans Flexibly; Zhejiang Starts Collecting Surplus Cocoons and Silk Factories Begin Production. After the spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces came on the market, silk factories in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi were preparing to start production. The Banking Syndicate decided to handle cocoon purchasing loans flexibly. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee for the Unified Control of Silk Cocoons has started collecting surplus cocoons. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Banking Syndicate Loans. The Banking Syndicate's cocoon purchasing loans for the spring season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the 25th year, from handling loans to silk factories and surplus cocoon purchases, have reached a total of six million yuan by yesterday's deadline. The Shanghai General Office and the Hangzhou and Wuxi branch offices released loans. Zhejiang accounted for three-tenths and Jiangsu for seven-tenths. At the same time, for the sake of flexibility, it was decided to extend the deadline for loans in Jiangsu to the end of the month. It is expected that the total amount of cocoon loans released in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be about ten million yuan. The original total amount was 30 million yuan, and now it only amounts to one-third. The Banking Syndicate has decided to distribute the recognized loan amounts according to the proportions recognized by various banks, money shops, and savings associations.</p>
<p>Unified Control Committee's Cocoon Collection. The Zhejiang Provincial Committee for the Unified Control of Silk Cocoons borrowed five million yuan from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to organize a cocoon collection committee for the spring season of the 25th year to handle cocoon collection affairs in Zhejiang. They have already withdrawn one million yuan from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Hangzhou and sent personnel to the registered surplus cocoon shops to open scales and purchase surplus cocoons. The prices are also handled in accordance with the standard prices set by the committee. At the same time, any cocoon shops that arbitrarily reduce the price of spring cocoons will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations. It has been found that several shops have violated the standard prices and should be punished accordingly.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons in Two Provinces. Although the spring cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is abundant, totaling about one million dan of fresh cocoons, Jiangsu Province is better than Zhejiang Province. This is because the silkworm rearing period in Zhejiang Province started earlier, and the cold and rainy weather had an impact. Therefore, although the spring cocoon harvest in Haining, Chongde, and other places in Zhejiang is good, the cocoons are slightly inferior. The cocoon collection in Zhejiang Province is about to be completed, while the cocoon collection in Jiangsu Province is just beginning. Silk factories in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi are all preparing to start production. As for the silk factories in Shanghai, they are expected to start reeling silk at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Operated as Usual Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Business Reached More Than 50,000 Yuan. According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Grand Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has been operating fairly well since it officially opened on the morning of the 12th of this month. Unexpectedly, a dispute arose a few days ago between the fish vendors of various vegetable markets over traffic and rebates, and they put forward five conditions, requiring the directors of the fish market to give a satisfactory response. The board of directors had already paid attention to improving the various points requested by the fish vendors. Except for items one, two, four, and five, which are not problematic and can be accepted, the third item requests that the handling fee of 5 li per yuan be returned and kept by responsible personnel from the fish vendors' market for the purpose of building a guild hall for the fish vendors (the handling fee is requested to be calculated at 1.5 fen, and the returned handling fee will also be 5 li permanently). This point involves changing the fish market's established regulations and must be submitted to the board of directors for approval by the ministry before it can be implemented. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the fish vendors also published a notice in the newspaper, stating that they would operate as usual. Unexpectedly, troublemakers spread rumors the morning before (Wednesday), causing them to obstruct fish vendors from going to the market to purchase goods. On the afternoon before yesterday, the board of directors again requested the municipal government to order the municipal security team and the municipal public security bureau to send more troops and police to maintain order. Therefore, from 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the market's business has completely returned to normal. According to Li Zicai of the market's general affairs office, as told to the reporter of Shen Shi News Agency, the market's business yesterday morning has returned to normal, and the traffic problem has also been resolved. The total business volume reached more than 50,000 yuan. As for the thirteen fresh fish shops that have not joined the market and went to Beijing to petition, the situation has also eased, and it is generally hoped that they will join the cooperation in the near future.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Proclamation Strictly Prohibiting Disturbances. According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Government of this city issued Proclamation No. 324 yesterday, stating: "The Shanghai Fish Market was established by the Ministry of Industry by gathering fishery merchants and people, with the aim of promoting official-commercial cooperation and developing the country's fishery industry. The government previously approved the Ministry of Industry's request for assistance and strictly prohibited obstruction, and has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to comply accordingly. According to reports, since the market opened, there have still been a small number of fish vendors who have been exploited and have engaged in disturbances, which not only hinder the market but also violate government orders. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and prohibit them, this proclamation is hereby issued, ordering all fishery fish vendors to strictly comply and not to engage in disturbances. Those who dare to deliberately violate this will be severely punished without leniency. This proclamation is issued on May 28th."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Refutes Wu Tehai's Criticism. According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the English-language Da Mei Evening News published an article by Wu Tehai on May 22nd criticizing the fish market. The article was quite dissatisfied with the fish market and contained the intention of instigating the concession authorities and foreign residents to oppose the fish market. The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Wang Xiaolai, the general manager of the fish market, to inquire about his views on Wu's paper. Mr. Wang made the following statement: "Mr. Wu Tehai, I have never met him, but judging from what I have heard about Mr. Wu's previous essays, he seems to be quite jealous of China's progress. Therefore, his observation of China's affairs is often dominated by a deliberate opposition subjective viewpoint, or even disregarding the facts and the attitude that critics should hold, mocking and attacking to satisfy his intentions. It is expected that he would issue an essay advocating opposition to the Ministry of Industry's policy of establishing a fish market to improve the fishery industry. Therefore, I did not pay much attention to this article at first. In the second paragraph of his paper, he said that the organization of the fish market itself may be a beneficial facility for the business, but in the third paragraph, he made the opposite judgment that the fish market will affect the food supply in the concession, even saying that the fish market will raise fish prices and prevent fish from entering the concession, which is a malicious or unreasonable inference. In the fourth paragraph, he said that foods such as livestock, vegetables, and fruits will have the same organization as the fish market, spreading the seeds of opposition in the minds of readers and engaging in advocating for creating disputes. But the possibility of these seeds being realized due to Wu's advocacy is very weak in my estimation. The concession authorities and foreign residents all have the experience and insight to judge right and wrong and will not be incited by excessive rhetoric. Moreover, the purpose of the Ministry of Industry in establishing a fish market is not only to improve the fish industry but also to make it restore the concession market and promote the commercial relations of various countries in China. In this way, the fish market will fulfill the Ministry of Industry's entrustment and carry out its mission of improving the fish industry. Whether Chinese or foreigners, anyone who takes the public interest as a prerequisite and gets rid of the command of private interests will be willing to provide sympathetic assistance to the fish market. All those who study politics or society today know that political progress and social prosperity are based on the economy. In recent years, due to the world economic crisis invading China, the financial industry has been forced to tighten due to the economic dynamics. This has affected the industry and commerce, resulting in a sharp drop in purchasing power and a phenomenon of market decline. Even the once prosperous concession market is now unable to avoid this calamity. Therefore, the countermeasure to deal with the economic crisis today is to work hard to develop production, cultivate the economy, and seek to build purchasing power, and then adjust the corresponding supply and demand. I am afraid that the already declining market may not be easy to revive. The purpose of establishing a fish market is to improve the fish industry. The so-called improving the fish industry is to help fishermen and fish merchants develop production in the sea. According to experts' estimates, the total value of the production of each fishing ground in China's territorial waters is 400 million yuan per year, and the value of annual fish catches is less than 50 million yuan. It can be seen that there are still 350 million yuan of fish products left in the sea. If these 350 million yuan of fish products can be used, fishermen, fish merchants, and fish vendors can increase their purchasing power by 350 million yuan per year. The use of this purchasing power will not only benefit China's economy and industry and commerce but also enable the commercial interests of various countries in China to benefit from it. Then there is no doubt that the concession market can get assistance from this to revive. However, to advance the 350 million yuan of fish products in the sea, this cannot be achieved overnight. There must be a whole plan, such as what methods should be used to provide economic assistance to fishermen, how to encourage their interest in fishing, and encourage them to improve fishing gear and improve technology. All of these require detailed research. In addition, after the increase in fish production, what methods should be used for residents to be happy to eat fish, easy to get fish, and even improve their eating methods and eat more fish. All these must be carefully planned. All of these cannot be realized unless the fish industry is first put into management similar to unified control. The fish market is an organization that strives for rational management of the fish industry and promotes the fish industry. Therefore, if Mr. Wu recognizes the significance of modern unified control management and the value of purchasing power, he will no longer have the concern that the fish market will prevent fish from entering the concession and raise fish prices. Because there is no phenomenon of demand exceeding supply of fish, the fish market will not be willing to store fish for no benefit, and it will not be possible to deliberately reverse the principle of commercial cheap and high-quality goods. It is also said that recently some people involved in the fish industry, in order to protect their private interests, have acted in violation of the Ministry of Industry's orders. The evolution of this behavior has caused various disputes, which are the things that should be in the process of reform. However, if this situation is well-intentioned under the assistance of the concession authorities, it can be eliminated soon. For example, fish vendors who are purchasing fish, after leaving the market, may be blocked and disturbed by thugs on the way, or after the fish is transported to various vegetable markets in the concession, they are surrounded by thugs to prevent them from selling. This is already a realized fact, proving that preventing fish from entering the concession is not the fish market that plans to improve the fish industry, but the foolish people who listen to unconscious agitation, disregarding the public interest and using their bodies to test the law. I know from my experience as a taxpayer in the Public Concession that the concession authorities will definitely stop this illegal violence. As for the inferences of Mr. Wu's past remarks, there is already a fact that proves his lack of understanding. I hope that he will not make the opposite inference in the future to damage his reputation as a critic. If he turns to the conclusion that the organization of the fish market itself is a beneficial facility for the business, it is the reasonable guidance that we can adapt to the environment, then we will still welcome it."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Issues a General Order to Various Counties to Ban Disguised Taxes</h3>
<p>Not In the Name of Taxation But With The Reality Of Taxation: The Benefits Of Fact Have Not Been Realized And The Resources Are Exhausted. The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued a directive to the Shanghai County Government yesterday, which stated: "The directive of the Executive Yuan stated that according to the letter from Zhang Shouyong, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of Zhejiang Province, on May 1st, 25th year, 'Recently, new policies have become increasingly numerous, and most expenses are without specific funding. Local governments cannot cook without rice, so they set up various names to collect from the people, which are repetitive, cumbersome, and unbearable. The Central Government is saddened by the decline of people's livelihoods and mindful of the damage to the national strength. It urges the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and strives to implement it. Therefore, those who raise funds in localities do not use the name of taxation, but use the name of certain expenses, thinking that it does not involve the scope of taxation and can not love the laws and regulations, but they do not know that the resources that people pay, whether they are donations or expenses, are no different, and if this trend grows, then after a business is done, raising funds and arbitrary demands, how can the people afford it? I am afraid that the benefits of fact have not been realized, and the resources have been exhausted. This will hinder both the national economy and the people's livelihood. In the end, the government establishes an expense that is collected by a business, even if it is not called taxation, is it within the scope of taxation, and can it not be subject to the supervision of financial laws? The committee has some doubts, and on the 25th of April this year, the 17th regular meeting was proposed for discussion and submitted to your hospital for explanation and instructions. If it is considered to be within the scope of taxation, please order the provincial government to handle such situations in accordance with legal procedures, so as to show caution.' According to this, if the local government establishes a kind of business, and the expenses are not called taxation, it is in fact no different from taxation, and it cannot avoid the name of taxation and not be subject to financial laws. As requested, all provincial and municipal governments should be notified that if there are such situations, they must still handle them in accordance with legal procedures. In addition to informing the Ministry of Finance and the branch offices, it is appropriate to order compliance with this order." According to this, in addition to issuing orders to the administrative inspectors and various county governments, it is appropriate to order the county magistrate to comply with this order.</p>

<h3>Soviet Propaganda Organization Recruits Chinese Journalists</h3>
<p>Foreign News Agency Translates Shanghai Daily News</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Soviet propaganda agency TASS and the local English-Russian newspaper New World have recently placed advertisements in English and Chinese newspapers to recruit journalists, eleven Chinese for TASS and six for New World, totaling seventeen people. This shows that the Soviet Union will begin actively engaging in propaganda, communication, and intelligence activities in the Far East and Shanghai. The recruitment of a large number of Chinese journalists is mainly for translating Chinese and Japanese opinions, articles, and meeting news. This, along with the activity of Soviet intelligence agencies, is a matter of great concern.</p>
<h3>Banking Sector Advocates Establishing a Currency Printing Company in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Huge Losses due to Outsourcing; Ministry of Finance Pays Close Attention</p>
<p>In light of the increasing circulation of banknotes in the market after the implementation of the new currency policy, the banking sector in Shanghai is concerned that apart from a portion of one-yuan notes and a very small number of jiao notes printed by the Zhonghua Book Company, the rest are all printed by foreign merchants. The printing costs are quite high, and banknotes are easily damaged. On average, each banknote needs to be replaced every three to four years. Therefore, the outflow of currency printing fees is alarmingly high. The Shanghai banking sector previously advocated raising large amounts of capital to purchase currency printing machinery from foreign merchants and establish a currency printing company in Shanghai to prevent such losses. However, due to various issues, it has not been implemented. With the increasing quantity of legal tender circulating in the market, it is generally believed that establishing a currency printing company should no longer be delayed. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is also paying close attention to this matter and will discuss solutions. The Shanghai banking sector is willing to provide strong assistance.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Relocates for Recuperation</h3>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Businesses to Correct National Flags Displayed</h3>
<p>Shops Should Use Size 6 Flags; Those Not Conforming Should Be Changed Immediately</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to all guilds yesterday regarding the correction of the national flags used by stores. It read: "To Whom It May Concern, On the 25th of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal Committee for the Uniform Implementation of National Flags stating that the national flag is a symbol of the party and the nation. The people's respect for the party and the nation must be reflected in their respect for the national flag. National celebrations and commemorative days require the display of the national flag to show celebration and commemoration, which is a common practice in all countries. However, our people lack knowledge of the national flag, and flag production in the private sector is inconsistent. This greatly affects appearances and undermines national dignity. In view of this, the Central Government issued a clear order to unify the national flag. Municipal party and government agencies and organizations, in compliance with the Central Government's order, aim to rectify the city's appearance and awaken the national spirit. Since its establishment, this committee has decided through consultations that it is impossible to promote it universally without door-to-door promotion and that without the assistance of various agencies and groups, the effect will not be significant. Therefore, in addition to sending propagandists from this committee to publicize the implementation, various agencies and groups should also inform their affiliates to prepare and use the unified national flag. Therefore, we request your association to forward this letter to all trade associations, instructing all members to prepare and use the unified national flag to rectify the city's appearance and awaken the national spirit, which is essential for our future and interests. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly." On the same day, the committee also sent the unified implementation methods to the association. According to the methods, the standard size of the flag for shops is size 6. The implementation method is to set up a number of implementers in each district, who, together with the police districts and the Public Security Bureau, will go door-to-door to persuade and guide, starting with the prosperous roads. It is hoped that your association will prepare a standard size 6 flag and send implementers to correct door-to-door to your affiliates. Those that do not meet the standards should be persuaded to change them immediately.</p>
<h3>Accountants' Association to Recruit Members for Civic Training</h3>
<p>Even Those Over the Age Limit Should Be Universally Recruited; National Association of Construction Industries Notified to Handle Accordingly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants' Association recently proposed by Jiang Wanping, an accountant and a standing director, that China has been weak for a long time and is ashamed to be called the "sick man" of Asia. The people are the foundation of the country, and everyone should feel guilty. In the past, King Zhao of Wuling adopted the custom of wearing nomadic clothing and riding horses, and the country became strong. Strengthening the foundation and cultivating the roots should not be neglected. Our government, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions, attaches importance to guiding the fundamental plan of the people. Civic training has been held in various provinces and cities. On hearing this, I feel encouraged. It is now learned that the Municipal Civic Training Center has been established, and it is proposed that the association notify all members to register with the association within two weeks for training. The age for training is stipulated to be between 18 and 35. I believe that since they are citizens, if they are not old, they should not evade because they are over the training age. Many of our colleagues are over the age limit, but their spirit of governing affairs has not declined. We should universally recruit them to promote this. Wanping's age has also exceeded the limit, so I dare to ask to start with myself. We also ask the National Association of Accountants to notify the member associations of various provinces and cities to follow suit. The training time each day is proposed to be set before 9:00 AM so as not to interfere with duties. Whether or not this is appropriate, the new resolution will be submitted to the recent standing committee for review.</p>
<h3>All Standing Committee Members of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Raise Funds in Groups to Purchase Aircraft for Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the French Concession and Nanshi, Today in Pudong and Zhabei; Workers in Various Factories Enthusiastically Participate, May Reach Budget</p>
<p>For the purpose of purchasing an aircraft for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday, all standing committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions began to raise funds in groups from yesterday at factories and in charge positions. The results are very good. It is scheduled to continue today and the Shanghai Bank's main and branch offices have been entrusted to collect donations from workers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure in Groups</p>
<p>Zhou Xuexiang, Acting Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Standing Committee Members Zhang Kechang, Ye Xiangfu, Long Peiyun, etc., departed in two groups starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. The first group is responsible for the Central District, Hongkou, Hudong, Yangshupu, Zhabei, and Wusong of the Public Concession. The second group is responsible for various districts such as Hubei, the French Concession, Pudong, and Longhua to conduct fundraising work. Many factories have already contacted for payroll deduction, and the results are very good. It is scheduled to continue today.</p>
<p>Projected Donation</p>
<p>This time, the labor community is expected to donate 50,000 yuan for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday to purchase an aircraft. According to Standing Committee Member Zhou Xuexiang, all workers deeply feel the seriousness of the national crisis and that all citizens should assist the government in strengthening national defense construction. Therefore, they are enthusiastically participating in the donation and it is expected that the projected amount may be exceeded by the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>Bank Collects on Behalf</p>
<p>In order to concentrate the donations, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has entrusted the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank's headquarters and branches in various districts to collect them on their behalf. All receipts for worker donations from factories and shops throughout the city have been submitted to the bank for verification. If the factories transfer donations, they can contact the bank for handling.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Telecommunications Workers Asks to Participate in National Assembly Election</h3>
<p>Telegraphed the Central Government Yesterday Asking to Redetermine the Number of Representatives</p>
<p>Yesterday, representatives of the National Federation of Telecommunications Workers convened an urgent meeting to demand matters related to the election of representatives to the National Assembly and resolved the following:</p>
<p>* To telegraph the Central Government requesting to redistribute the number of representatives.</p>
<p>* To contact various special industry associations nationwide to proceed with the matter in unison.</p>
<p>* To nominate representatives to participate in joint meetings. The association's telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Public Training, Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China: Having recently read the newspaper reports on the National Assembly Representative Election Law passed by the Legislative Yuan, although there are provisions for occupational groups to be units of the nation and not divided by regions, the special industry associations such as telecommunications, postal, road, and aviation are missing in the list of occupational representatives. This is deeply disconcerting. Furthermore, representatives of telecommunications workers from various places have been requesting the Central Government to stipulate the number of representatives for the telecommunications, postal, road, and aviation industries. We have checked that special industry associations were first advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and that our telecommunications, postal, road, and aviation special industry associations have a considerable history, sound organizations, and a wide range of members distributed throughout the country. They are also a complete organization under the Central Government and should not separately participate in the occupational elections of various provinces and cities, nor can they all participate in the occupational elections of one province and city. At the beginning of the party-state's implementation of constitutional government, the importance of the status of special industries is no less than that of other sectors of the people. However, the National Assembly Representative Election Law passed by the Legislative Yuan does not clearly stipulate how our four major special industry associations with inseparable characteristics can participate in the election. This seems to be inconsistent with the principles of the representative election law stipulated by your ministry. The right to elect is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we urgently telegraph your ministry to amend the election law as soon as possible and clearly stipulate the number of occupational representatives of our four major special industry associations to conform to principles and meet the situation. The National Federation of Telecommunications Workers, reverently petitions.</p>

<h3>Chen Fengcai, et al., Accused of Framing with Drugs</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Renders Separate Judgments</p>
<p>Dagongshe reports that Chen Fengcai, a woman from Ningbo, had worked as a prostitute in her hometown. Yu Hexing brought her to Shanghai, and they lived together for several years. Later, due to Yu Hexing's poor financial situation, disputes arose between him and his wife. In the first lunar month of the 23rd year (of the Republic), she became acquainted with Zhu Jinquan and had an affair. Consumed by passion, they eloped in the second month of that year. Yu Hexing and others apprehended them, but she continued her affair with Zhu Jinquan. In April of the previous year, Zhu Jinquan conspired with Chen Fengcai to frame Yu Hexing in order to fulfill their desire to live together. Zhu Jinquan entrusted A Lai, a native of Cixi, to purchase a large package and three small packages of heroin for four yuan and eight jiao. They secretly hid them under Yu Hexing's bed, covering them with a broken pot. He then asked his acquaintance, Xu Menghuan, also from Cixi, to report to the Public Security North Gate Police Station that Yu Hexing was harboring heroin and a handgun. The North Gate Police Station dispatched officers on the morning of April 24th, accompanied by Xu Menghuan, to search. Chen Fengcai had fled earlier that morning, and Zhu Jinquan also accompanied the officers, loitering outside Yu Hexing's house during the search. When the heroin was discovered, Yu Hexing was arrested. Fearing investigation, Zhu Jinquan fled elsewhere. Later, Chen Fengcai returned to her hometown to live with Zhu Jinquan. Yu Hexing and others then located Zhu Jinquan's address and negotiated with him. Zhu Jinquan handed over Chen Fengcai, who was taken to Shanghai by Yu Hexing on November 29th. They immediately turned her over to the Public Security North Gate Police Station, which transferred her to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Under interrogation by the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Department, Chen Fengcai confessed that Zhu Jinquan had asked A Lai, who had served as a security guard in Cixi for three months, to buy the heroin. "I heard Zhu Jinquan say that. The heroin was placed in an iron pot on the floor of the living room. Zhu Jinquan and I discussed buying the heroin for four yuan and eight jiao to frame Yu Hexing. It wasn't Zhu Jinquan who reported it, it was someone named Xu," she confessed without reservation. Subsequently, the Garrison Headquarters sent a letter to the Cixi County Government to arrest Zhu Fuquan and subpoenaed Yu Hexing's family, Yu Dan Shi and Yu Chen Shi, to the case. After thorough investigation, judgments were rendered: Zhu Jinquan and Chen Fengcai jointly framed others with drugs, intending to sell and possess them. Zhu Jinquan was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Chen Fengcai was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, which was reduced. The judgments were submitted to the Military Affairs Commission for approval and execution. They have been sent to the Caohijing Second Prison. Recently, ignorant individuals have frequently engaged in framing, only to be caught by the law and regret their actions.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Sets Deadline for Cart Wheel Modification</h3>
<p>Cart Industry Mutual Aid Association Seeks Opinions, Prepares to Negotiate with Public Works Department to Cancel</p>
<p>The Municipal Cart Industry Mutual Aid Association notes that the Public Works Department has set July 1st as the date for all carts to be modified with widened iron or rubber tires. The association believes this matter is of great importance and has issued a notice to all members of the industry to seek their opinions in preparation for negotiations. The original text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"To our fellow cart operators: Recalling last summer, the authorities of the Public Concession wanted to increase our taxes. This association, recognizing that our members could not bear the burden, fought and negotiated repeatedly, finally achieving the cancellation of the tax increase. However, a second problem now falls upon our members. That is, the Public Works Department has decided that from July 1st of this year, all our members must widen their cart wheels to two and a half inches or install rubber tires. The Public Works Department's proclamation No. 4642 regarding this matter is copied below for your information.</p>
<p>Proclamation: It is hereby proclaimed that from July 1, 1936, all carts must be equipped with semi-iron tires at least three and a half inches wide, or solid rubber tires at least one inch wide. Special Proclamation, dated November 21, 1935, by Acting Director Feli Pu.</p>
<p>This matter is as serious as last year's tax increase. After learning of it, this association expressed the following opinions: 1. Enlarging the cart wheels will definitely make them cumbersome and inconvenient. 2. With roads in eastern Shanghai in such bad condition, requiring all members to replace all cart wheels will definitely be a financial burden. 3. If rubber tires are to be installed, that would be even more unbearable because a set of rubber tires currently costs more than one yuan. 4. At the same time, rubber tires are not durable and need to be replaced every two years. How can those who make a living through blood and sweat afford this?</p>
<p>This association sent the above opinions to the Public Works Department, requesting that they consider the difficult times and exempt us from implementing the measure, but it was not accepted. The implementation date of July 1st is approaching quickly. To be prudent, this association has created a 'Soliciting Opinions Form' for all members. Please select one of the three options on the form: 'Agree', 'Oppose', or 'Postpone', according to your opinion, and mark it with a '十' sign and send it to this association for statistical purposes to serve as the basis for negotiation. The situation is very urgent, so do not delay.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to say to our fellow members: To alleviate any suffering, the first thing is to be united so that we can generate the power to resist. This is very clear. Therefore, at this critical juncture, we must hope that members who have not yet joined the association will quickly join so that we can act together and increase the power of negotiation. This association has articles of association, application forms, and membership forms available for members to read or fill out."</p>

<p>A bizarre murder case was discovered yesterday morning at No. 13 Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road. The deceased was a middle-aged man, his hands and feet bound with rope. The body was already decaying. When the body was discovered yesterday morning, the second landlord of the house noticed a pungent odor in the kitchen. Upon forcing the door open, they discovered the deceased lying stiffly under a board bed supported by wooden benches. The odor was pervasive and unbearable, causing extreme alarm. The Cheng Du Road Police Station received the report and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western officers to investigate, cordoning off both ends of the alley. Upon entering the room and searching, they found a pair of high-heeled women's shoes and a bicycle in the kitchen. It is reported that the deceased had just moved in on the 13th of this month, residing in the kitchen downstairs, accompanied by companions. Because they entered and exited through the back door (while the second landlord used the front door), they had not paid attention. Shortly after, the door of the kitchen was found locked, and it was assumed that the entire family had gone out. Therefore, when the deceased was murdered is highly speculative. It is truly a bizarre murder case.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Zhoujiazui Road, Four Thieves Arrested, Three Wounded</h3>
<p>One Thief Shot</p>
<p>At approximately 8 PM yesterday, four bandits suddenly went to a certain residence at No. 69 Hengtai Lane, near Zhoushan Road on Zhoujiazui Road, to rob. Only one bandit was armed with a handgun. They first drove the men and women in the house into one room, and then searched, but the room was empty. They only managed to rob fifty yuan in cash before quickly exiting. Unexpectedly, the homeowner was quite courageous. Seeing the bandits leave, he followed them stealthily. Upon reaching the alley entrance, he shouted for help to catch the robbers. The bandits were caught off guard and panicked. Just as they were about to scatter and flee, the patrol officers at the post had already arrived. Seeing the bandits fleeing, they fired their guns, first knocking down the armed thief, and seizing the handgun. At this time, other patrol officers nearby also heard the alert and gathered. Therefore, two more bandits were captured and the stolen goods were recovered. They were all taken to the police station for temporary detention. The injured bandit, due to the severity of his injuries, was transported by vehicle to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. His condition is very critical.</p>

Streams of pilgrims thronged the roads, stretching for miles. The area around the temple was swarming with people. The temple was filled with incense, and there was no room to stand. Worshippers flocked forward, one after another. Although Chinese, Western, and Indian police and mounted patrols patrolled the temple surroundings, the crowds of visitors continued to gather and disperse. After worshipping, pilgrims purchased goods from the various temporary stalls, resulting in brisk business and tripled profits.

<h3>Young Woman Lies on Train Tracks Awaiting Death</h3>
<p>A Sad Story, Abusive Behavior of Lover</p>
<p>At approximately 9 AM yesterday, a young woman was discovered lying on the tracks of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, west of the Shanghai South Station near Luban Road, by a track supervisor who was carrying out an inspection. The supervisor immediately rescued her and took her to the railway police section for questioning. According to the young woman, named Zhang Meiying, 18 years old, residing outside the Qianmen Gate in Suzhou, she was hired as a domestic helper in Shanghai in June two years ago. She met a Mr. Zhang, claiming to be No. 197 from the French Concession Tram Company, and was seduced into an affair. In April of last year, she returned to Suzhou for a matter. In July, Mr. Zhang of No. 197 wrote to her, urging her to come to Shanghai. She rented a house at No. 53 Xinxin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, and lived with him. Within two months, Mr. Zhang disregarded expenses, leaving her with no choice but to find work as a domestic helper again. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhang continued to seduce her, causing her to lose her job. Now, when she asks him for living expenses, he not only ignores her but also gathers hooligans to beat her up. She has no other option but to despair and came to the railway tracks to die, but was rescued by the railway police, etc. After questioning by the railway police section, it is planned to send her with a prepared document to the [City] Gate Branch, which will then transfer her to the General Bureau for relief.</p>
<h3>Yonghua Pharmacy Accused of Exaggerating Claims of Two Drugs</h3>
<p>Police Press Charges of Fraud, Court Orders Further Inquiry After Chemical Testing</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government, due to newspaper advertisements for the Longma Bu Bei Jing and Weili Sheng drugs sold by Yonghua Pharmacy, located at No. 512 Tianjin Road in this port, exaggerated the drugs' functions, claiming they could supplement energy, treat spermatorrhea, etc., and after testing, found that they were a disguised form of aphrodisiac. If not prohibited, they would cause deep harm. A letter was sent to the Health Department of the Public Concession Public Works Department, urging immediate suppression. The department notified the Old Gate Police Station, dispatching detective Lang Jintang to purchase the aforementioned drugs from the pharmacy and summon the owner of the pharmacy, Ni Renzhuan, a native of Hangzhou, to the First Special District Local Court. He was ordered to post a 200-yuan bond, pending further verification of the chemical testing. After chemical testing by the Health Department, it was found that although the drugs did not contain aphrodisiacs, they also did not have the effects claimed in the advertisements. The advertisements constituted fraud. Yesterday morning, Public Works Department lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a fraud charge against Ni Ren. Judge Ye Bichao summoned Ni to court for questioning. Ni submitted the prescription, stating that both drugs were formulated according to the prescription. Judge Ye reviewed the submissions, stating that it was necessary to chemically test whether the drugs were formulated according to the prescription submitted by the defendant. The defendant was ordered to remain on the original bond, with a two-week extension pending further inquiry after the chemical testing.</p>

Nine hundred and seventy-nine counterfeit five-jiao bills were found. Chen Hongfang, Gao Tian Shi, male and female, were also taken into custody as suspects and sent to the First Special District Local Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang continued the interrogation. The Central Bank dispatched a support team to the court to prove the differences between the counterfeit and genuine bills. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Chengbiao confessed that he was entrusted by a fellow villager named Yu to purchase the counterfeit bills and bring them back to the village to circulate. Diao Yunzhang confessed that the bills were sold to Zhang by Li Si, and he only introduced them. After the court interrogated [the suspects], they were destroyed. Chen Hongfang and Gao Tian Shi were acquitted.</p>

The Police Department found that Sun Jiaju, Zhao Fugen, Yang Nanchang, Chen Ashi, and Fan Tao were not involved in the case, and requested the court to release them. Cai Quanfu, Gu Linsheng, and Pan Gensheng had committed robbery cases in Suzhou and Jiangwan, and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau was notified to send detectives to the Special District Court to take Cai, Gu, and Pan back for interrogation. The remaining defendants had robbed four families in the French Concession: Yang Quan'gen at 553 Rue du Pere Labourdette, Qian Yongqing at 17 Lane Fega, Avenue Constant, Chen Yin at 87 Avenue Zikawei, and Shen Zhirong at 131 Rue du Marche.

<h3>Municipal Garden Offers Wonderful Insecticide</h3>
<p>Using Pyrethrum as the Main Ingredient – The Municipal Garden's Various Precious Roses are in Full Bloom. The garden staff are very busy, working to eliminate juniper caterpillars and box tree caterpillars. They use specially made, fast-acting insecticides with all-purpose sprayers, spraying them in sequence on the affected plants. Upon contact with the agent, the majority of the terrifying pests immediately stiffen, shrink, and fall to the base of the trees to die, none escaping. It is truly a wonderful insecticide for eliminating pests. According to the garden staff, this agent is a potent pyrethrum extract, combined with lime-sulphur and mechanical oil in appropriate proportions, hence its remarkable efficacy. The dosage and application method of the agent vary slightly depending on the type of pest and the seasonal climate. Anyone who needs it can inquire at any time, and they are happy to provide detailed answers.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Paint Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce – No. 26)</p>
<p>Market Price of Paint: Paint prices are generally stable, with little change over the years. However, this is only a superficial phenomenon. In reality, the situation is quite different. The wholesale prices of various factories are contracted using discounts. The initial wholesale price was at a 10% discount, but now it is mostly reduced to 20%, and some even drop to 25%, depending on the sales of their products. Currently, wholesale prices vary greatly. Zhenhua, Yonggu, and Kailin had previously discussed a unified market price method, but it fell through due to conflicting opinions. Recently, the price of tung oil, an important raw material for paint, has soared, raising the cost of paint. Various factories are seeking to raise prices, while foreign goods have already generally increased by 10% to 20%. At current prices, foreign goods are about 30% more expensive than domestic goods. The following is a summary of recent market prices (using Yuanfeng Company products as a standard):</p>
<p>(Note) One kilogram equals 2.2046 pounds, and one liter equals 0.2642 US gallons.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Paint Factories: The number of paint factories in Shanghai is small, and the changes over the years have been relatively stable. The only factories that have successively closed down are Huachang in 1930, Rongguang in 1931, and Guanghua in 1932. As of now, there are seven paint factories in Shanghai with Chinese capital, including Yonggu. In addition, there is also the Yongguang Paint Factory at 2200 Pingliang Road. This factory is a joint venture with the British Taikoo Jardine &amp; Matheson, with a capital of 500,000 yuan in national currency. It was established in June of last year and its products are exclusively used for painting Taikoo ships, so they are not widely available on the market. This factory is the first instance of foreigners establishing a paint factory in China. During the Shanghai War, the factories in the war zone suffered heavy losses. Kailin Factory, the leader in the industry, was also severely damaged and eventually suspended operations last year, now only partially operating. However, the paint industry is still relatively strong among general industries, and there are still profits to be made, so there are recent rumors that a new factory will appear, and the closed Guanghua is also preparing to reorganize into the Dachang Paint Factory. The industry currently does not have a trade association because the number of existing businesses is still small.</p>
<p>Yonggu – Established in 1928 with a capital of 120,000 yuan, located at 900 Jiangwan Road. The current chairman of the board is Shen Fan'an, and the directors are Chen Jiechu, Shen Cihui, Chen Jueping, and Chen Qingshun. The supervisors are Liang Xinzhi and Li Zhendong, and the manager is Chen Guangshun. Its products include Longcheng (Great Wall) brand paints. The distributors for remote provinces are Huachang Company, for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces are Tongrenhe, for southern provinces are Dansted Company, and there are also outlets in the Dutch East Indies. The Dahua Red Lead Factory on Maigen Road in this city is a subsidiary of the factory.</p>
<p>Kailin – This factory is the earliest and largest paint factory in China, founded by Zhou Yuantai and others with a capital of 375,000 yuan, with complete equipment and new machinery. It was first established at Baoshan Road in Zhabei, and moved to Tongji Road in 1919. In 1929, it purchased more than 30 mu of land in Jiangwan to build a factory building. Unexpectedly, its scale had just begun to take shape when the January 28th Incident occurred. The old factory was completely destroyed. Although the new building was preserved, its vitality was damaged. Due to various reasons, it was forced to declare a suspension of operations last year. It has now been restored by creditors, but its situation is not what it used to be.</p>
<p>Wanli – Established in October 1932, founded by Lei Tiancheng and others, located at 457 Xietu Road. The original capital was 30,000 yuan, which was increased to 60,000 yuan last year, with a paid-in capital of 48,000 yuan. The current chairman of the board is Ye Jisan, and the directors are Yang Zeguang, Zhang Weifu, Wu Xingzhai, Zhou Xinsan, and Fang Zhiwei. The supervisors are Hu Botao and Fang Wenbing, and the manager is Wu Yinhuai. Its products are Sailing Ship brand paints and is known as a rising star in the industry. Its business is good.</p>
<p>Zhenhua – This factory was established in 1918 with a capital of 200,000 yuan, located at Tanziwan in Zhabei. Its products include Flying Tiger brand paints. The current chairman of the board is Le Zhenbao, and the directors are Zhang Lanping, He Meixuan, Zhao Zhulin, Liu Xingyue, Shen Jinshun, and Yuan Lizhang. The supervisors are Chuan Songnian and Wang Yunfu, and the manager is Zou Jingwei. The factory also has a business office.</p>
<p>Yonghua – This company was previously located in Beiping. In 1929, it came to Shanghai to raise capital, and it was declared established in November of that year with a capital of 50,000 yuan. The chairman of the board is Zhang Jiuxiang, and the manager is Wang Taijing. The factory is located at 339 Lanpo Road, and the distribution office is located at Zhaofu Lane, Hankou Road. Its products include Lion brand paints. The business is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Yuanfeng – Established in 1932, located at 898 Xieshi Road. The manager is Sun Menggang. Its products include Fan brand paints, specializing in high-quality goods, with very few low-end products. The distribution office is located at 117 Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Guanglu – This factory was organized by Lu Lianfang, the former manager of Wanli Factory, and was established only last spring. The capital is 60,000 yuan, and the factory is located in Kangqu Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>Addendum: The Chinese Red Lead Manufacturing Factory at 26-30 Wangjiazhai, Kangqu Road, South Shanghai, also produces red lead, and it is used by various railway bureau paint factories, the Shanghai Tram Company of the Municipal Council, and various chemical industrial institutes. The manager of the factory is Mr. Wu Jichun, and the distribution office is located at 2 Renyifang, Kangjia Lane, Xiaodongmen. (End)</p>

According to reporters, after receiving the telegram, He originally planned to take a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Guangzhou to Shanghai yesterday, but due to bad coastal weather, the plane could not take off on time. Therefore, He took another flight to Shanghai this morning at approximately 7:00 AM, and will arrive at Longhua Airport at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Works by Ms. Yang Lingfu – First Day's Report</h3>
<p>Ms. Yang Lingfu of Wuxi exhibited her carefully selected works and models of the Summer Palace and the Grand View Garden at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association on Tibet Road yesterday. A large number of visitors attended that day. The paintings encompassed various styles, and her copies of portraits of emperors of past dynasties of the Qing Dynasty were considered the most precious and rarely seen by the general public. It is said that many of the pieces have already been reserved. At the same time, Ms. Kang Tongbi, the daughter of Mr. Kang Youwei, also added her most exquisite and elegant Chinese paintings to the exhibition. In addition, Ms. Yang's handmade models of the Summer Palace and the Grand View Garden were arranged and designed with great ingenuity. The pavilions and terraces were lifelike, and viewers praised them highly. Many foreigners also attended the exhibition. The paintings can be viewed freely, but a small admission fee is charged for the models. Group students can enjoy a 50% discount. Half of the proceeds will be donated to public welfare undertakings. It is said that starting from the 30th, the exhibition will continue for three days at the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>Fire in a Straw Hat Workshop in Ji Jia Lane</h3>
<p>At 8:20 last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the rear building of the house of Jin Ziqing, a Ningbo native, at 1 Yuandeli, Ji Jia Lane, inside the Old North Gate. Jin was a landlord who operated a straw hat workshop. His front and rear buildings were connected, but the front building was rented to Du Youfa, who made badges. The rear building was used by Jin to store straw hats. No one was in the building when the fire broke out, and it is not known where the fire started. Fortunately, police officer Cheng Shifang of that area discovered the fire and immediately reported it to the station, which notified the fire department to send vehicles to the scene to put out the fire. Approximately one room was burned. Jin Ziqing and Du Youfa, the fire starters, were taken to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Home of Qiu Qiaosheng, Foreman at the Dadong Tobacco Company, Robbed</h3>
<p>Qiu Qiaosheng, a native of Zhenjiang and foreman in the machine room of the Hongkou Dadong Tobacco Company, and his concubine, Ms. Yuan, lived together at 31 Fu'an Lane, Taojiawan Road. They had some savings, and their furnishings were luxurious, attracting the attention of bandits. At approximately 6:00 PM last night, seven robbers wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers and Qian Chunzhang jackets broke in, armed with handguns, axes, and other weapons, falsely claiming to be searching for drugs. Two robbers guarded the back door as lookouts, while the remaining robbers went upstairs, ransacked the boxes and cabinets, and searched for an hour. They took over 600 yuan in legal currency and gold jewelry worth over 500 yuan, and one robber rode Qiu's bicycle and sped away. The remaining robbers fled in the direction of Yucai Road. When the Linping Road police station heard the news, they sent police to pursue and arrest them, but the robbers had already disappeared. A thorough investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Taifeng Company Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Taifeng Biscuit and Canned Food Company, the earliest established in China, was forced to close down two years ago due to being implicated in a case. It has now re-raised new shares and will continue operations. The company is scheduled to open next month on the 9th. The company's Xiaosadu factory has recently been operating day and night, producing in large quantities. The retail store has begun preparations, and the old employees, who were paid half salary during the shutdown, have all returned to work.</p>
<h3>North Station: Detective Squad Arrests Several Robbers</h3>
<p>Around 2 AM yesterday morning, Gu Liancheng and Guo Mengqu, the chiefs of the North Station Detective Squad, received a report from detective Zhang Dalong stating that several robbers were secretly plotting a robbery operation in their den at No. 39 Hexing Lane, Tiande Road, requesting their arrest. They then dispatched team leaders Hu Kuisheng and Gao Hao, along with detectives Jiao Bingyun, Peng Haisheng, Zhuo Shaoliang, Zhou Jitang, Yang Fuchen, Yang Hanzhang, Zhang Liangjin, and Huai Xinmao, all disguised as rickshaw pullers and scavengers, to secretly wait near the robbers' den. At approximately 3:15 AM, they spotted two suspicious individuals loitering around the lane entrance for a long time before entering house No. 19. The detectives signaled each other and swarmed in, arresting robbers Li Ziming (nicknamed "Pockmarked Damingzi," from Yangzhou, 27 years old), Wang Bianxi (from Yancheng, 18 years old), and Yang Fusheng (from Yangzhou, 20 years old) on the spot, along with suspects Dong Fuquan (from Funing, 22 years old) and Xu Yongmai (from Funing, 35 years old). They seized a No. 1803 six-round automatic "lotus head" pistol, three bullets, and seven pawn tickets. The team strictly interrogated them. According to Li and the other robbers, they confessed to robbing the Zhu Wang family at No. 17 Qingji Lane, Qingji Road, and the manpower company of Xia Wenhuan at No. 15 Zixiang Lane, Disiwei Road. Dong and Xu confessed to going to the "Swallows' Nest" on the upper floor of No. 35 to smoke opium and claimed to know nothing about the robbery. The case was deemed related to robbery, and they were sent to the General Bureau this afternoon for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Robber Attempts to Escape, One Shot Down by Police</h3>
<p>Two more arrested, guns seized in Zhabei Qimei Road Yangjiawan area. Around 9 PM yesterday, two patrol officers from the local police station were patrolling the area when they noticed four or five men lingering nearby, acting suspiciously, as if they had intentions. They immediately stepped forward to question and search them. Who knew that these people were indeed robbers and were carrying weapons? Seeing the police approach, they turned and fled. Despite the police repeatedly ordering them to stop, they ignored the commands. Therefore, the police immediately opened fire, shooting one of them down. The others then stopped. When the police caught up, only two men remained. A pistol was found on the wounded man, and he was taken back to the police station along with the other. The investigation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Wu Dongsheng and Others Sentenced for Throwing Stones at Fish Trucks</h3>
<p>At 6 AM the day before yesterday, forty-seven trucks loaded with fish vendors and fish left the Shanghai Fish Market and passed through Niuliang Road and other places. They were pelted with stones by Ningbo natives Wu Dongsheng and Liang Atang, intending to stop them from advancing. They were apprehended by Chinese and Western detectives. Wu and Liang were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. After questioning by Judge Yang, the defendants were sentenced to 30 days of detention each as a warning.</p>

A notice was issued yesterday, stating: "To all concerned, a meeting of creditors of the Wing On Silver Company was held at the Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd of this month.

We sincerely hope that you will attend and participate on time and refrain from giving up."</p>
<h3>Huade Sky Blue Light Bulbs on the Market</h3>
<p>As summer approaches, people living in small rooms often feel hot and stifled under the intense light of electric bulbs. Therefore, the electric bulb industry has specially invented and launched sky blue bulbs to adjust the light and make people feel comfortable and refreshed. Therefore, those who value family hygiene often pay attention to this. It is found that the sky blue bulbs produced by the Huade Light Bulb Factory are the best. Not only are they a well-known domestic brand that is durable, but they also emit an elegant light with strong filaments. It is now the time of the product launch, and it is said that electrical suppliers in Shanghai and other places are eagerly ordering, causing the factory to work overtime to manufacture them. The factory's assistant managers Tang Zhaoneng and Li Qingxiang are overseeing the work and feeling very hardworking.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Closed on June 1st</h3>
<p>This month, the 31st is the Christian holiday of Pentecost, which is the fifth Sunday after Easter. The Public Works Department of the International Settlement will, as usual, close for one day on the Monday of Pentecost, June 1st.</p>
<h3>Anonymous Elderly Man's Birthday Feast Aids Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Famine Relief Association at 505 Hede Road has spared no effort in publicizing fundraising since the Ministry of Interior approved the establishment of the Jianghe Water Disaster Relief efforts last year. Various sectors, moved by its efforts, have enthusiastically donated funds. By the end of this month, over 160,000 yuan in donations had been received. In addition to providing emergency relief to disaster areas, the funds have also been used to carry out road construction labor relief projects in northern Jiangsu, which are of great benefit to the national economy and people's livelihood, and provide a large number of jobs. An elderly man in this city, who has always supported the association's construction and disaster relief efforts, recently celebrated his birthday. Many relatives and friends offered congratulations, but the old man only served tea and snacks, saying that he wanted to benefit everyone by using the funds for the feast to aid disaster relief. Therefore, he sent 200 yuan to the association to help the disaster-stricken people, without wishing to be recognized for his charity. Instead, he requested that the receipt be issued in the name of "Respectfully Thanking the Longevity Public," showing his noble character.</p>
<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>New Contribution from the Family Wireless Radio Repair Shop The Family Wireless Radio Repair Shop was founded by Mr. Zheng Zengshou. Its purpose is to serve society and is not comparable to profit-seeking businesses. The repair fee for any damaged wireless radios sent to the shop is one yuan (customers are responsible for replacing damaged parts, but the shop can assist if needed). The shop not only offers low repair fees, but the repaired radios have clear sound and loud volume. Deliveries are prompt and reliable. Recently, many people have entrusted the shop with repairs, and business has been exceptionally busy. If anyone wishes to make an entrustment but finds it inconvenient due to distance, they can call phone number 21761. Engineers are regularly dispatched to provide on-site repairs or free inspections. The shop is located at 741 Zhaojia Road, west of the Guandi Temple, inside the Old West Gate.</p>
<p>China Underwear Factory Adds Workers The China Underwear Company is the pioneer in establishing underwear companies in Shanghai. The checkered cloth ABC underwear, large and small anti-collar shirts produced by the company have long been popular throughout the country and in Nanyang and other places abroad. Recently, the weather has temporarily turned warmer, and orders from various ports to supplement the factory's products have been coming in so quickly that supply cannot keep up with demand. The garment-making workshop has already extended its working hours and added hundreds of workers. It is said that anyone with garment-making experience, regardless of gender, can contact the personnel department of the factory at Jin Situ Temple, Kang Nao Tu Road, for selection.</p>
<p>Zhu Qishi's Painting Exhibition The epigraphy painter Mr. Mi Qishi Zhu will hold a three-day exhibition of paintings, calligraphy, and seal carvings starting today in the hall of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Mr. Zhu believes that with the current economic downturn in Shanghai, painting is not a necessity of life. Why should prices be deliberately inflated, causing people like Zong Shaowen to sigh with despair? Therefore, he has decided to drastically lower the prices. His intention is not to profit but to broaden his artistic connections. The painting world is barely surviving, and Mr. Zhu is one of those trying to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Yonggu National Paint Sells Well The Yonggu Paint Company, located at 900 Jiangwan Road in Shanghai, is a nationally funded enterprise that has been operating for many years and has a large scale. Its "Great Wall" brand paint and lacquer are not only beautiful in color but also remain unchanged for a long time. Once used on trains, ships, airplanes, automobiles, and all kinds of great buildings, this paint enhances the beauty and protects the surfaces. Therefore, domestic public and private institutions and organizations are competing to purchase and promote its products, resulting in extremely prosperous business. It is said that the company has management offices in major commercial ports, making procurement extremely convenient. Price lists and color samples are available and will be sent upon request.</p>
<h3>Publishing World</h3>
<p>New Collection of Letters, Second Series, Published The "New Collection of Letters," compiled by Zhou Lianggong of the early Qing Dynasty, is divided into three series. It collects letters from various masters of the Ming Dynasty, which are outstandingly beautiful. The China Literature Rare Books Series has published the first series, a vast work of 300,000 words, with a retail price of only five dimes. Therefore, it was reprinted within a month. Mr. Lin Yutang praised it in his article "Yu Shi Feng," considering it necessary to publish it in its entirety. Therefore, the Shanghai Magazine Company used a large sum of money to purchase the second series, collected the series, and included it in the Rare Books Series. It was published yesterday, edited by Zhang Jingluqun, and the retail price is four dimes and five cents. Anyone who loves letter literature and late Ming essays should read this book. It is not only a model for those engaged in letter writing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, In the May 24 issue of your newspaper, the local news column contained an item titled "Joint Farewell to Mr. Chen Zimi for Visiting Cooperation Businesses in Japan," stating that Mingru participated in the farewell as a private friend and not as a representative of the Rugao Fellow Villagers Association.

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Our Country's World Games Soccer Team's Tour of Europe, Written and Sent by Li Huitang</h3>
<p>Saigon, Day 1, May 8th: This was our first day in Saigon. We were escorted to the hotel by the welcoming crowds to settle our luggage. After a quick breakfast, at 9:00 AM, we were honored to have Consul Shen Guan Yi host a tea party at the consulate with speeches of encouragement, which were responded to by leader Rong. We had lunch at the Guangdong Restaurant. After lunch, we returned to the hotel to rest. The weather that day was alternately sunny and rainy, with oppressive heat. At 4:30 PM, we arrived at the stadium, which was packed with tens of thousands of people. Amidst thunderous applause, we defeated the Saigon All-Stars (B team) with a score of 8-1, to the satisfaction of the audience (match details to follow). In the evening, we were treated to a banquet at the Taihu Restaurant in Dike, hosted by overseas businessman Tao Duiting. At 11:00 PM, after the guests and hosts were all delighted, we bid farewell and returned to our residence.</p>
<p>Saigon, Day 2 (Saturday, May 9th): Last night was terribly hot, and the teammates tossed and turned, unable to fall asleep easily. There were also many mosquitoes. When we met this morning, we all complained about the hardships of the night. During the morning, the teammates mostly visited the park. In addition to plants and flowers, the park also had lions, tigers, and various other beasts. In terms of facilities, East Asia could be considered fully equipped. At noon, we were honored to have the local overseas Chinese organizations hold a welcoming conference at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. After leader Rong responded and introduced each of the players, we bid farewell and returned to rest. At 4:00 PM, we drove to the stadium to compete against the Saigon All-Stars (A team) (match details have been recorded separately). Because of our big victory in yesterday's match, and because the opponent was much stronger today, fans from all sides eagerly wanted to see a high-level contest, vying for a good spot. It was said that by around 3:00 PM, the not-very-large stadium was already packed, leaving no room to stand. Those who arrived later could only sigh at the door. The number of spectators and the revenue both broke the records for Saigon soccer matches. The lively scene at the time can be imagined from this. Under the oppressive heat, our team did not disappoint the overseas Chinese, defeating the enemy by a score of 4-1, causing them to lower their heads in submission. The results of the two days of matches made the overseas Chinese jump for joy and feel greatly gratified, truly comforting. After showering in the evening, we were treated to a champagne reception at the Grand Hotel by the local soccer association. Although there were no beauties present, the fine wine was enough to make us drunk. Leader Rong gave a thank-you speech in English and invited the soccer authorities to send a team to our country in 1938 to participate in the Far Eastern Games. After the reception, we hurriedly packed our luggage and boarded a boat, then took a car to the Qionglin Restaurant in Dike, to attend a joint farewell party held by overseas Chinese organizations. The elite of the overseas Chinese community gathered together, truly giving one the feeling that such a grand occasion would be hard to come by again. After three rounds of wine, I, representing our team, gave a speech, strongly urging the overseas Chinese community to promote sports and emphasize unity. After three cheers of farewell, it was already late at night, the clock struck twelve, and we returned to our boat together, preparing to set sail for Singapore at 6:00 AM tomorrow. Our short stay in Saigon also came to an end.</p>
<p>Singapore: We didn't have much of a connection with Saigon River's ninety-nine bends. We arrived at night and couldn't see it, and we left at dawn while still dreaming. At 6:00 AM on May 10th, the French mail steamer set off again for Singapore. On the boat, we did our morning exercises as usual. In the afternoon, after a nap, we went to swim in the open-air pool. Since departing from Shanghai, we haven't encountered any waves for ten days, and the voyage has been peaceful and comfortable, which is truly fortunate. Saigon is about 600 miles from Singapore by sea, and we arrived safely in Singapore in the early hours of the 12th. The French mail steamer, which had sheltered us for ten days, parted ways with us. When we arrived in port, those who came to welcome us were only teammate Cai Wenli, old friend Jin Zhuohua, and more than a dozen reporters and photographers. Not a single representative from the overseas Chinese organizations was to be seen. The dock was quiet, a stark contrast to when we landed in Saigon. People often say that the overseas Chinese in Malaya are poorly united, and it seems that there is some truth to this. After the usual photo-taking, we took a car to the New Asia Hotel to settle down. In the afternoon, we even went to the stadium to practice, attracting many onlookers. I, along with Rong and Huang, visited Consul General Diao, Zheng Liande, president of the Chinese Football Association, and enthusiastic supporter Hu Wenhu. The weather here is cooler than in Saigon. Although it feels hot during the day, the breeze from the sea at night changes the air in the whole city. Singapore is the hub of the Malay Peninsula, occupying an important position geographically, militarily, and commercially. The British government built two floating naval bases here years ago to strengthen its Far Eastern power. Most of the overseas Chinese are from Fujian and Guangdong. Those who were born and raised here are called "local-born" and have a very weak concept of their ancestral country. They are clearly separated from the overseas Chinese who came from the ancestral country, which is a major reason why the overseas Chinese community in Southeast Asia cannot be thoroughly united. In the Malay Peninsula, soccer is naturally the most popular sport. The strength of the overseas Chinese is also quite impressive on average. At the last National Games, their strength was not yet fully developed, but they still won the runner-up position. Almost every inter-city team has Chinese players. It is a pity that, due to environmental factors, they cannot return to the country in large numbers to participate in the preliminary rounds, resulting in undiscovered talents remaining overseas. Our soccer strength for this World Games is even stronger than it is now. We are passing through here this time, and we will play a match against the Singapore All-Stars on the 14th, and leave for the Dutch East Indies on the 15th. During our stay in Singapore, besides visiting old friends or touring famous scenic spots, there are no social engagements. "Without official duties, one feels light," but without social engagements, one feels empty. We are spared the constraints of etiquette and the trouble of formalities. But this shows the neglect of the sports community by the overseas Chinese organizations in Singapore. At 9:00 AM, Yan Jiaocheng and Kun arrived from Hong Kong to join us. The entire World Games soccer team has finally gathered for the first time. Then, the whole team took a photo on the hotel rooftop. At 5:00 PM, we played against the Singapore All-Stars. The crowded spectators created a new chapter in the history of Singapore soccer. As a result, we won a big victory of 4-0, winning applause from millions of overseas Chinese, who returned home satisfied. In the evening, we were treated to a banquet at the Nantian Hotel by our old friend Zhang Junjianhao. Zhang is enthusiastic about soccer and has been for more than a decade. Years ago, he was in charge of soccer news for a newspaper, and his comments were mostly pertinent. Lehua and Nanhua often came to the south, and he provided sincere care. Zhang can be said to be a thoughtful person. After the dinner, we went to the New World and Great World amusement parks. We didn't leave until midnight, when we had had our fill of fun.</p>
<p>Second Battle of Saigon</p>
<p>(Mr. Li's article was published in this newspaper on the 26th. Some paragraphs were accidentally inverted, resulting in incoherent sentences. But Mr. Li's article is very valuable, so we are reprinting it with emphasis, which we believe will be appreciated by readers.) Saigon's soccer has always been at a low level, unable to withstand a single blow. In previous years, domestic teams passing through here have inflicted crushing defeats on them. But their progress in seeking improvement has increased with time. It is a pity that they do not seek nobility in morality, and they never consider the spirit of sports. Each visit by a guest team leaves a worse impression. I still remember in the early summer of last year, the Shanghai Mixed All-Stars and the Nanhua combined A and B teams passed through Saigon one after another. Because their strength was not very complete, they were actually relied on by them to be rude and violent. Taking advantage of the favorable weather and location, they were successively defeated, creating an unprecedented record. The Vietnamese were arrogant and triumphant, and the overseas Chinese were frustrated and disappointed. This time, we have come with the elite of the entire country. They, with their amateurish soccer skills, also foolishly want to frustrate us. Today's match is Saigon gathering its best soccer players to deal with us. We are also cautious. Except for those injured in yesterday's match, the rest are all dressed in battle attire. My body is weak after being sick, and I should have rested. But the overseas Chinese community strongly requested that I play, and I couldn't refuse their sentiments, so I reluctantly joined the battle. The first half ended with a score of 1-0. The final result was 4-1. The goal scorers were Zhuo Shijin, Feng Jingxiang (1 each) and Chen Zhenhe (2). At the beginning, we deployed the following formation:</p>
<p>Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai Chen Zhenhe Zhuo Shijin Bao Jiaping Huang Meishun Li Huitang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Liang Rongzhao Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Today's weather is very strange. It hasn't rained all day, and the soccer field is relatively dry. The match started at 4:30 PM. The enemy's progress was very fast compared to what we had seen yesterday. For the first fifteen minutes of the game, they were cautious and defensive, with no gaps to be exploited. It wasn't until the 22nd minute that Comrade Shijin scored the first goal. The first half ended there. After drinking cold water, our team changed its formation to:</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai Li Guocheng Li Huitang Bao Jiaping Xu Yaxiang Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Liang Rongzhao Zhuo Shijin</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Because we couldn't score more goals in the first half, many spectators were worried about us. At the start of the second half, the enemy's momentum was fierce, repeatedly entering our territory. Fortunately, their shots were not accurate, and they didn't score. After fighting again for a short time, taking advantage of a free kick, Xiao Bao was blocked by the defenders, and they scored a goal, creating a 1-1 tie. The Vietnamese fans cheered loudly. Our team calmly dealt with it, quietly waiting for an opportunity. Before long, Zhenhe, with his brave charge, scored two goals in a row. The enemy revealed their true colors, and the victory or defeat was determined. Before the end of the game, Feng, the center forward, scored again, making the score 4-1, ending a fierce battle and giving the overseas Chinese community another opportunity to cheer and throw their hats. In this match, the opponent's strength was indeed stronger than yesterday. Because of the weather, we couldn't endure the battle, so the match was more spectacular. The referee was French. Although he was still ignorant of the soccer rules, he often stopped rough play, which was a world apart from yesterday's Vietnamese referee. However, there were still many illegal things that are not allowed in Hong Kong and Shanghai. He generously forgave and didn't blame them. As a result, several of our players were still slightly injured by their soccer violence. In both matches, under the harsh air and rough environment, we were able to retreat with great patience, never retaliating in kind, and avoiding the unpleasant incident of chaos in the field. This has to be admired for the cultivation of each of us. Our performances in the two days, although we had a week of rest on the boat, still felt less than perfect. There was still a lack of understanding in the cooperation aspect, and our strength was also insufficient. This is probably due to the great impact of the weather upon our first arrival in the tropics. According to a French observer, he said that we have the skills, but our strength is lacking. When facing strong European teams, we are afraid that our stamina will not be as good as theirs, which will be a big disadvantage. Strength comes from training. We will definitely work hard to remedy this weakness, to avoid the major problem of the heart being willing but the flesh being weak. Let's wait and see for the future.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Specialist Completes Inspection of Higher Education in North China</h3>
<p>Sun Guofeng and Guo Youshou Return to Nanjing to Report to the Ministry of Education. Last month, the Ministry of Education sent Sun Guofeng, a senior inspector, Guo Youshou, a specialist, and Chen Kezhong, a middle-ranking official from the Natural Science Group of the Compilation and Translation Bureau, to inspect colleges and universities in Shandong, Hebei, Beiping, Tianjin, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Chen Kezhong happened to be in mourning for his brother and was unable to go. After receiving their orders, Sun and Guo left Beijing on April 20th and first inspected Qilu University in Jinan, then went to Beiping. The colleges and universities inspected included: Public: Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Beiping University, Normal University, Northeastern University, Art College, and Municipal Physical Education College; Private: Fu Jen Catholic University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, China College, Chaoyang College, Republic College, and Railway College, a total of fourteen colleges and universities. (As for the medical colleges and independent medical colleges of each university, experts have been sent separately to inspect them, and they are not within the scope of this inspection.) They then went to Tianjin on May 11th to inspect the National Peiyang Engineering College, Nankai University, Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Women's Normal College, College of Law and Commerce, and Tianjin Industrial and Commercial College, a total of seven colleges and universities. On the 21st, they went to Baoding to inspect the Hebei Provincial Agricultural College. They then received a telegram from the Ministry of Education instructing them to postpone the inspection of Jiao Zuo College. They left Baoding on the 22nd and arrived in Kaifeng on the 23rd. From the 25th, they inspected Henan University and the Water Conservancy College. After the inspection was completed, Sun and Guo set off to return to Beijing and reported to the Ministry on the 28th, reporting the inspection to the head of the ministry. It is noted that the Ministry of Education's inspection of higher education this year was held in late March when Sun and Guo were ordered to inspect 33 colleges and universities in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi with Chen Panzao, Dai Xia, Hao Gengsheng, and Zhao Shiqing. Together with the 25 colleges and universities inspected in this northern trip, a total of 58 colleges and universities, more than half of the country's higher education institutions, have been inspected. The reporter specifically asked the two about their impressions of this trip. The answers are excerpted as follows: Although the colleges and universities in Beiping and Tianjin have experienced student unrest, they have completely returned to normal. Classes are orderly, and the internal situation is very stable, which shows that the school authorities and teachers are leading effectively, and the students are able to focus on their studies, which is very gratifying. Each college and university has made progress in recent years, and the speed of progress is like two different schools compared to two years ago. The atmosphere of academic research has also gradually increased. Many professors reported their achievements to us, and we were happy to listen. Many schools have added small workshops to make their own instruments (including self-blown glass), which are more than ten times cheaper than imported ones and can also incorporate their own improvements, which is a good phenomenon. The timely distribution of education funds in recent years is an important reason for stabilizing the colleges and universities and helping them to develop. For example, the improvement of teachers' salaries and the implementation of the full-time system are all dependent on this to achieve results. The central government's subsidy of 720,000 yuan per year for private colleges and universities has greatly helped the development of each school receiving this money in terms of increased equipment and the establishment of chairs, which can be said to have achieved twice the result with half the effort. Widespread inspection of higher education has been held since the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. This year is the third time. The schools are used to it and regard it as an annual routine. Some schools have prepared forms in advance to facilitate the inspection, so that it is easy to understand. The attitude of the school colleagues in the places we went was sincere, like a married daughter seeing her family come to visit, and both sides expressed happiness and closeness. This harmonious situation is the result of the close relationship between the educational administration authorities and the schools in recent years, which is very valuable. When we left Beiping and Tianjin, we looked forward to seeing each other again next spring. Whether there will be changes in personnel is unpredictable, but it can be asserted that the inspection and the spirit of coordination will last forever.</p>

<h3>Increased Scholarships for Impoverished Students</h3>
<p>Divided into Twelve for Enrollment and Five Within the School</p>
<p>Full Exemption of Tuition and Book Fees for Three Years: The Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, met last year in a meeting, and proposed to the board of directors to establish twelve enrollment scholarships and five internal scholarships for impoverished students at each of the council's Chinese middle schools. After this proposal was passed by the board of directors last summer, it was implemented in mid-September of last year. Recently, the Education Committee held another meeting to discuss the matter and decided to petition the board of directors to add seventeen more scholarships to each of the council's middle schools in mid-September of this year, namely two for enrollment and five within the school. The methods and intentions will be in accordance with the old system of last year. It is understood that these scholarships will last for three years. During these three years, all scholarship recipients will enjoy the benefit of full tuition exemption, and their books and stationery will also be provided by the school. However, at the end of the first and second years, their academic performance will be carefully reviewed to determine their continued eligibility. It is reported that the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has already approved the Education Committee's proposal. Furthermore, the twelve enrollment scholarships are allocated as follows: four scholarships for entrance exams for graduates of the council's elementary schools, four scholarships for entrance exams for graduates of non-council elementary schools (within the International Settlement), two scholarships for entrance exams for female graduates of the council's elementary schools, and two scholarships for entrance exams for female graduates of non-council elementary schools (within the International Settlement). Moreover, the issuance of these scholarships is intended to subsidize students from impoverished families. Therefore, only students with excellent qualifications and genuinely poor family circumstances are eligible to apply. The subjects for the examination include Chinese language, history, geography, nature, English, and arithmetic. The age limit is thirteen years, calculated according to the Gregorian calendar. Parents must be residents of the International Settlement. It is also reported that the examination date is June 20th. Those who wish to obtain this scholarship can first contact the authorities of their respective schools.</p>
<h3>The Origin and Interpretation of Self-Reliance Doctrine</h3>
<p>— Written by Li-sheng Zhang Yuanruo</p>
<p>I. Origin: Since the national crisis, Yuanruo has deeply encouraged himself, consulting historical records and observing the national situation. He deeply feels that the national crisis has its historical causes, and there must be a central principle to respond to it. Everything has its roots and branches, and every matter has a beginning and an end. Speaking of self-awareness, it is most important to seek practical results through self-reliance. Speaking of national strength, we should especially seek the development of human resources. Therefore, the self-reliant preparation of "gathering people, educating, and training" is an imperishable principle for national revival. Although hasty people may doubt its slowness, if the foundation is established, the way will be born. We must not be like reckless men who rely on brute force and ignore the foundation in our eagerness to seek success. We must know that the meaning of life is a constant upward struggle, and the life of a nation is the total accumulation of the efforts of all its people. If we leave aside all political grievances and emotions and reflect on ourselves, we will know that the general cause of today's national weakness is the poor planning and consumption of human resources. Therefore, to strengthen national power, self-reliance is paramount. There is no secret to revival and strength. Examining the process of national development in the East and West, such as the European Renaissance and the Japanese Meiji Restoration, they were examples of self-awakening and self-reliance. In recent times, the rise of Turkey and the development of Russia and Italy have all been the result of the hard work of the whole country and the full exertion of everyone's strength. Based on this objective understanding of facts and the principle of historical development, I dare to call for "self-reliance doctrine," inheriting the legacy of ancient sages who taught the people and drawing on the essence of the doctrines of scholars from various countries. Over the years, I have been repeatedly invited by universities and academic groups at sea to lecture on this doctrine, and I am deeply grateful for the sympathy expressed by sages and youths at home and abroad. I am still continuing my research, and the entire work will be completed in hundreds of thousands of words. However, I think this doctrine is profound, and I am concerned that my own understanding may be lacking. Therefore, I am specially describing its origin and adding interpretation to seek correction from the country.</p>
<p>II. Interpretation: Self-reliance doctrine takes the development of the individual's intelligence, morality, and physical fitness as its starting point, and increasing the welfare of society, the nation, and mankind as its goal. Everyone should perform their duties in their respective positions, practice self-reliance, and seek the fulfillment of their obligations and the completion of their personality. Therefore, self-reliance doctrine is an "action doctrine" for self-rescue and national salvation, reaching others and achieving all. In terms of its historical mission, it is to inherit the teachings of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, who taught the world to "move," and the legacy of Wang Yangming, Gu Tinglin, Yan Xizai, and Sun Yat-sen, who encouraged the people to "act," and to carry them forward. In terms of its philosophical foundation, it is a product of adjusting Western Greek thought and Christian thought, correcting deviations and patching up shortcomings. In terms of its ideological system, it takes the strengths of various doctrines and discards their weaknesses, being a conclusion that harmonizes individualism, socialism, liberalism, and fascism. In terms of the needs of the times, it can correct the Chinese people's bad habits of empty talk, vanity, decadence, and inertia, and cultivate the spirit of action, pragmatism, hard work, and struggle. It is a central, foundational thought that hits the nail on the head, saves the country, inspires human resources, and revives the nation.</p>

In the after-market, the bank slightly sold, while the Chinese merchants bought, and there were more short-term transactions, and it was still flat. After entering, the British and American Tobacco Company came to buy US dollars, but the bank and the central bank were still selling, and Indian silver also rose 4.45 anna. The process was still hovering until the closing selling price. The English exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375, and the US exchange was 19.98125, which was the same as the previous close, but because the spot and this month were leveled, the forward was slightly relaxed.

<h3>Month End Approaching, Finance Slightly Busy</h3>
<p>The financial market situation has been unremarkable for several days. It is said that this year's cocoon tea business has been completely abandoned due to the lack of lending capacity. Most of the other high-end goods are limited by economic capacity and have little entry and exit. As a result, the situation this month is far less busy than in previous years. However, yesterday's situation felt slightly smoother. As the end of the month is approaching, and the return to the East is imminent, the entry and exit of funds from special envoys, etc., has increased compared to usual, especially the settlement of accounts, which is quite large. Although there is no definite number, it is more than in the previous months. In addition, the number of imported items such as medicinal materials, cloth, silk, and cosmetics has also increased, and there are more settlements. It is appropriate that the situation has gradually improved. Yesterday's foreign exchange was still 9 points, and the transfer notes did not change significantly. The early market transferred more than 2.4 million, with more than 100,000 new transactions, and more than 200,000 transactions in the noon market. The small general meeting traded 2-300,000, the bank collected and released foreign bank collection notes for more than 2.9 million, various exchange miscellaneous collections for more than 3.2 million, telegraphic transfer funds for more than 200,000, and special exchange funds for more than 300,000. Chinese banks collected and released notes for more than 2.8 million, various goods, exchange, tax, and miscellaneous collections for more than 2.7 million, telegraphic transfer funds for more than 200,000, and special exchange funds for more than 200,000. Japanese banks collected and released notes for more than 1.6 million, various goods, exchange, and miscellaneous collections for more than 2.2 million, telegraphic transfer funds for more than 200,000, and special exchange funds for more than 100,000. Money houses collected and released foreign public bills for more than 43 million, foreign headline collections for more than 3.2 million, and various exchange funds for more than 400,000. In the subsidiary coin market, 60,000 Guangdong small foreign coins were traded in the early market, and the underground market price was still 12.01 cents, the same as the previous day. Copper coins were still 302,500 characters, with 10,587 strings and 500 characters traded. Legal currency was 3,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: May Futures Bonds Settled Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, May 28th, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the settlement date for May futures. The total settlement volume was slightly higher than before, totaling 17,995,000 yuan. Among them, those settled by brokers through mutual account clearing and self-settlement amounted to 7,660,000, and those settled on the exchange amounted to 9,935,000 yuan, with C and E bonds being the most numerous, accounting for 10,289,000. On the receiving side, most were Sichuan and retail investors, mostly for the purpose of receiving legal currency. On the delivering side, most were small silver and money businesses and retail investors. Regarding market prices, since the start of trading on March 26th, prices once fell sharply due to issues such as the increase of troops in North China and the disputes between Germany and France. On April 12th, the lowest price for A bonds was 64.1 yuan, B bonds were 61.85 yuan, and C bonds were 60.065 yuan. Since then, due to Chen Guangfu's negotiations in the United States, which yielded good results, the agreement benefited China's finances greatly. Rumors arose in the market, and the Sichuan investors' need to use legal currency made the trading even more active. Since April 20th, the prices of various public bonds have gradually reached new highs. By May 13th, A bonds had reached new highs seven times, with the highest price being 69.2 yuan. Except for A bonds, other bonds also reached new highs one or two times. After that, although there were various rumors in the environment, such as the increase of troops in North China, serious smuggling that was about to affect the interior, and the death of Hu Hanmin, the Japanese were about to exclude the Nine-Power Treaty, and the situation became increasingly worse. Market prices often inverted, spread trades disappeared, and the biggest reason was that the majority of the financial community withdrew from the market, speculators had nothing to use, and trading decreased sharply, like a wide river with shallow flow. Even if there were storms and rain, it would not cause waves. It is not easy to escape the current state of consolidation in the short term. Now I will list the May futures settlement account and its total transaction volume separately (unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Before Settlement, Yarn and Cotton Were Flat and Lacked Spirit</h3>
<p>Actual Sales Were Not Smooth... Market Prices Fell Slightly</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat and tired, and the situation was quiet, but the market state felt particularly bland and lacking in spirit. This was because the current yarn business was lonely, and there was no contact from all sides. Because the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, there was a commercial habit related to it, so there was no hope for the sales market at present, people's hearts were weak, and market prices were increasingly hovering.</p>
<p>The Golden Rooster only opened the forward yarn market with a small seven or eight corner mark. Because there were few transactions in the market and the market was scattered, each month fell by three or four corners, but certain aspects did not take any action. The three-disk slightly returned. Until the close, it was heard that yarn sales were not smooth, and people were tired. As a result, each month fell by three, four, and eight corners compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was still mediocre, and the turnover was even rarer. Today is the last day of this month to handle settlement procedures and suspend trading. Generally, floating investors will first straighten out the night, and the change is less. As a result, this month rose by one corner compared to the morning closing price, and the remaining months fell by two, three, and four corners. It is understood that 450 bales of Dafu, 800 bales of Tongji, 750 bales of Daji, 800 bales of Mingde, 500 bales of Yuan Yi, 800 bales of Dachang Cheng, 800 bales of Dachang, 1,000 bales of Tonghe, 1,500 bales of Hexing, 800 bales of Changfeng, 550 bales of Run Kang, and 400 bales of Jinghua were sold. 100 bales of Judian, 500 bales of Yu Kang, 450 bales of Yu Da, 750 bales of Geng Feng, 450 bales of Changji, 400 bales of Chang Yu, 1,600 bales of Xing Chang, and 950 bales of Shen Ji were purchased. The highest price and closing price for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton market fell slightly. Because the overseas Indian and English cotton markets were abnormally sluggish and lacked characteristics, people's hearts were weakened, but the amount concentrated by buyers still did not give up. However, there was still no suitable way to deal with a large amount of coarse velvet cotton, so some people tended to sell it.</p>
<p>Sakura forward cotton did not move. The pre-market opening for marked cotton fell by one to five pounds due to good predictions for the American cotton eastern cotton area. Indian cotton fell by 0.25 to 0.75, and Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 2.3 corners. The market was bland, the market transactions were not prosperous, and there was still no business for group velvet cotton, so although the situation was firm, new buyers lacked enthusiasm. As a result, each month fell by one corner to one and a half corners compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening was still ordinary, and the transaction was particularly bleak. Xincheng went short, and as a result, each month fell by five points compared to the morning closing price, but October rose by one corner. It is understood that 1,200 loads of Chang Yu, 3,100 loads of Run Kang, 3,300 loads of Sheng Yuan, 1,600 loads of Zhen Da, 1,000 loads of Ming Hua, 2,700 loads of Yuan Yu Chang, 2,100 loads of Chang He, 800 loads of Sen Kang, and 3,000 loads of Xincheng were sold. 1,000 loads of Ming De, 4,000 loads of Geng Feng, 3,300 loads of Shen Ji, 1,800 loads of Yi Chang, 3,400 loads of Yi Kang, 1,000 loads of Chang Feng, 1,100 loads of Yong Da, and 900 loads of Xie Cheng were purchased. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>The current cotton factory has good sporadic current cotton consumption. The factory needs sporadic supplies, which continue uninterrupted. The source is 155 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>Review of the Yarn and Cotton Market in the Past Half Month</h3>
<p>Wild Rise and Fall... Particularly Alarming</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the situation of yarn and cotton has been rising and falling sharply, and the momentum is turbulent. Forward marked yarn has repeatedly entered and exited the 200 yuan mark. There has been a fierce struggle between the long and short sides, and everyone has different opinions. The long side initially relied on the Sino-US monetary agreement, the government declared that it would fully maintain the legal currency credit, and worked hard to pull in, and the price flew up by two or three yuan a day. Forward yarn saw 204.5 yuan, and marked cotton once saw 44 yuan. The short side considered the abundant inventory and rampant smuggling in North China and tended to sell. Unexpectedly, in May, the long side came out of the box on the 9th, and the market suddenly fell by 3.8 yuan to 4.8 yuan, and Sakura fell by 1.25 yuan. Certain aspects, seeing the decline was violent, came to buy a large amount again, and the market price suddenly jumped. The difference between the opening and closing prices in one day was 4.89 yuan, and the cotton difference was 1 yuan. Following the fact that the deadline for the settlement of the May futures and chemical yarn was approaching, the seller collected and bulked up the current yarn for delivery, with more than 10,100 bales. Certain aspects actually received 13,900 bales, and the rest were settled by themselves. The prosperity of the receipt of goods was a new record since the squeezing of the Indian merchants in March of the 21st year. It can be seen that the buyer has been planning carefully. The total number of yarn stored in the warehouse is 22,990 bales. Now a certain party has accepted 10,000 bales. The huge number of standard yarn and cotton stocks has broken the record since the opening of the exchange, with 700,1850 bales, and 1,395,400 loads of standard cotton. The standard cotton short side delivered continuously, with a total value of 8 million yuan in addition to 100,000 loads of single coarse velvet cotton. It is heard that the demand for current yarn has recently stopped and entered a peaceful state. Judging from the above situation, the waves of the future are still in the storm.</p>
<h3>US Cotton's After-Market Returned to Softness Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's US cotton opening saw mixed rises and falls, and most companies were waiting for progress in Washington. The market was first bought up by domestic and foreign counterparts, and the east was firm due to lack of rain, but then cotton farmers cashed in and local gangs sold off, returning to softness. The current demand was calm, and the closing was calm and firm. The current price rose by 1 pound, and the futures rose by 1 pound to 5 pounds. English cotton spot futures fell by one point. Indian cotton initially fell due to sales by current merchants, but later rose due to purchases by speculators and counterparts. The average was up and down 0.5 to 1.25 rupees, and Omra and Buroxi fell 0.75 rupees.</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Buroxi on the 28th was 200.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Three-Piece Yarn and Cotton Rebounded</h3>
<p>Osaka Telegram on the 28th: The price of three-piece futures yarn rose by 0.6 to 1.2 yuan, with the near month at 192.2 yuan and the far month at 191.2 yuan. The price of futures cotton rose by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan, with the near month at 62.65 yuan and the month at 58.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Summer Printed Cloth Suddenly Sees Prosperous Sales</h3>
<p>Sui Chang Printed Linen Yarn Original Box Plus Clothing Materials</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth gang was flat and harmonious, and the buying price was still to be determined. Jinjing only entered Donghuo Blue Double Fish Fine Cloth Nianbao, and ten boxes of plain satin. Guanggang's interest in heavy coarse cloth was still strong, and there were continuous transactions of 200 pieces of 16-pound four flat, 14-pound eight flat lotus, and 14-pound earth, etc. The interest in fine cloth and fine twill was weak, and there were only a few transactions. Diangang slightly increased the purchase of nearly 100 pieces of this factory's fine cloth and fine twill. Yesterday, the weather turned hot, and the sales of printed cloth, white ground color, printed linen yarn, and foreign yarn suddenly increased. Hankou, Changsha, Shantou and other places have all been shipped. This balance of zero cutting and inland wholesale is also hot. Most of the printed linen yarn is produced by Lunjing Factory. This season, the factory focuses on promoting printed linen yarn, and the dealers have specially ordered bonuses, and the sales volume is huge. It is heard that more than 2,000 boxes have been sold this year. Starting this week, each box will be given six pieces of clothing, which can be called a new and ingenious way to promote cotton cloth. The recent sale price is 0.29 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>The Scope of Woolen Fabric Sales is Extremely Narrow; There is Virtually No Trade to Speak of in Northern China</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of woolens and fabrics on this street were still good. Summer goods such as tea-mixed yellowish twill, white drill, white straight weave, feather yarn, Valitin, serge, Paisley, linen canvas, floral striped herringbone straight weave, etc., were being actively sold by brokers running around the Public Welfare Association market and various tea gatherings. However, wholesale business has been very quiet recently. Due to certain reasons, there is no trade with Northern China. Most of the Sichuan merchants have already completed their purchases and are mostly specifying domestic goods. Due to the current political and economic climate, business from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces has not been smooth. For various reasons, the volume of imports along the Yangtze River has also decreased by half compared to previous years. In summary, the wholesale sales of woolens and fabrics have been very limited in recent years. Due to the impact of taxation, there is no hope for expansion in the north, and only the southern provinces offer some room for development.</p>
<h3>Yuanfang Piece Goods are Universally Praised</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Yuanfang's 299th auction. Thirty cases of various goods were on display, and trade was quite active. Due to the limited arrival of foreign goods, market prices were universally praised. Western satin rose by four to five cents per yard, Yuan-velvet by three cents, and both straight-weave wool and Yuanfu silk saw slight increases. The price of Yuan-feather silk pieces rose for all brands. Colored Barathea rose by seventy cents, heavy-weight was in demand for both red and blue foreign cloth, while blue cloth prices were stable. Only the Five Flower Cave and Eighteen Sons brands of white cotton cloth were offered, with each piece rising by fifty cents.</p>
<h3>Grain: The Factory Temporarily Withdrew Goods Offered; This Month's Flour Price Increased by Nine Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the opening of the flour market, the market for each month suddenly underwent a huge change. The speed of the price increase for June was particularly surprising. Due to sluggish trading, the pressure of squeezing was very severe. Initially, the price of foreign wheat was quoted at eight to ten cents higher in Chicago and about one to two cents higher in Canada. Because the weather was clear and there was little change in the price of foreign wheat, the market sentiment was quite stable. However, the price of June wheat was driven up by scarce offerings and relatively strong demand from small buyers, with the market being two cents higher than at the opening. But the prices for the longer term were still weak. In the afternoon, the market for June wheat suddenly changed dramatically, partly because real sales in the north were slightly more active, but mostly because the factory withdrew the goods it had offered. As a result, prices rose sharply with each transaction, and the closing price rose to three yuan, one and a half cents, a huge increase of nine cents compared to the previous day's closing price. The prices for longer term remained flat at first, but later rose by one cent due to the high price increase for June.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Also Rose Sharply Following the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the futures wheat market opened with prices generally stable for each month. Prices of foreign wheat varied. Although the weather was clear, it was still half a month until the new wheat would arrive, and a month until the threshing. Therefore, both buyers and sellers were hesitant, making it difficult for trade to be brisk. The market remained calm in the initial part of the afternoon session, but later, with the high price of flour, the price for June rose sharply, causing a general increase in sentiment. At the close, prices rose by six to eight cents. However, those in the trade generally believe that because the areas in Jiangsu and Anhui where tobacco was planted have been converted to wheat cultivation, wheat production is higher than in previous years. If the harvest is good this year, it will be difficult for wheat prices to remain high, so the current abnormal situation is not formal. The wheat market remains stable, with opening prices similar to the previous day. 400 bags of Shandong Yaowan wheat were offered at four yuan and twenty-seven cents, which were purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>New Broad Beans from Wenzhou Have Arrived on the Market</h3>
<p>The highest price opened at four yuan and fifty-five cents – nine and a half cents higher than the first batch last year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another two hundred and forty bags of new broad beans from Wenzhou arrived, totaling over one hundred bags. The quality of the goods varied. The seeds were slightly larger than the fourteen bags that arrived earlier. Only Tianjin merchants inquired about and selected the high-quality goods, purchasing seventy-three bags at prices of four yuan and fifty-five cents and four yuan and forty-five cents. It is reported that the remaining quantity has not yet been negotiated. The market price is nine and a half cents higher than the highest price for the first batch last year (the highest price for the first closing on May 12th of the 34th year was three yuan and sixty cents). If subsequent trading is not active, this price may not hold. The bean cake market remained active due to the sunny weather, with over 20,000 pieces of various cakes being traded across the board. Market prices rose by a fraction of a cent, allowing for a turnaround in raw soybeans. Six to seven thousand bags of cartwheel beans were traded, with prices rising by three to four cents.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Already Shows Signs of Demand Exceeding Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice from the Yangtze River and Eastern Zhejiang arrived in small quantities. Due to consistently active trading with Japanese merchants, market prices rose steadily, and market prices in the production areas were consistent with the wholesale prices. Although the arrivals have been continuous recently, sales have been brisk, with sales exceeding arrivals. Market sentiment is generally positive. In addition to regular purchases on this street, merchants from Quanzhou and Ningbo were very keen to purchase, and there was also a small amount of demand from the interior. With continued smooth trading of Ke Xian rice, all rice prices generally improved by three to five cents. Jiangxi early rice is expected to be popular sooner or later. A total of 6,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 123 bags of Hunan rice, 235 bags of Taiwan rice, 200 bags of Shashi rice, and 100 bags of Jiangbei rice were offered throughout the day. The market remains strong. If the trading of Ke Xian rice continues to be active, prices may need to be raised gradually.</p>
<h3>Both White Medium Rice and Thin Rice Have Few Buyers</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly thirty sources from various groups arrived (totaling more than 6,000 piculs). The sales market on this street remained dull, and merchants rarely inquired. Northern merchants only purchased two to three hundred bags of thin rice and five to six hundred bags of thick medium rice, so the market was weak. The price of thick early medium rice fell by a fraction of a cent, while the price of thin rice fell by several cents to nearly a dime. Sheyang fine rice and Yinbian Yuan rice were all weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-eight or twenty-nine sources arrived from various routes in Hexia. The demand for various types of rice on the market was weak, especially white medium rice, which was weaker than before. Market prices fell by a few cents to a dime. Transactions of thin rice were scarce, and prices also fell slightly by nearly a dime. Yinbian Yuan rice was stable, while various Xian rice were weak by three to five cents. The other goods faced downward pressure.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tung Oil Market Fluctuated Three Times in One Day</h3>
<p>The oil market has been quiet for a long time, with only sporadic transactions by foreign firms. According to reports from Hankou, Jing heavy oil was seventeen yuan, Tianjin heavy oil was sixteen yuan and fifty cents, Fuchai market scale was fifteen yuan and twenty cents, and Macheng market scale was fourteen yuan and fifty cents. Lacquer oil with grain and pattern was eleven taels. Tung oil prices fluctuated three times in one day. In the morning, Jardine Matheson bought 30 tons at 69.5 yuan per ton, and another 25 tons at 70.5 yuan per ton. Noon bought 50 tons at 71.5 yuan per ton. In the afternoon, Shilong bought 25 tons at 72 yuan, Jardine Matheson bought 50 tons at 72.2 yuan, and another 80 tons at 73.25 yuan. After receiving the news, local merchants held up sales prices. Jing oil was nominally 19.6 yuan per unit, Macheng oil per catty was 17.6 yuan, white wax rice core was 114 yuan, and combined was 116 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Seafood Goods Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>Ten cases of Golden Hook Tails Were Sold Out As Numbers</p>
<p>New Shrimp Paste Fell Sharply</p>
<p>New Golden Hook Shrimp Tails: Yesterday, another two batches of hot water goods arrived, totaling ten cases. The goods were similar to the first batch that arrived previously. At the start of trading, seven cases were priced at 100 yuan, and three cases were priced at 99 yuan and 80 cents. Because the amount was not large, buyers were still keen to purchase them. It is reported that they have all been sold.</p>
<p>New Golden Carp Tails: Four cases also arrived, with the dealer's cost estimated at 110 yuan. However, the highest asking price from the merchant was only 103 yuan. Because of the expected losses, the dealer has not yet sold the goods.</p>
<p>New Jiangbei products also arrived yesterday in five pieces, but the quality was poor and the sizes were small, not as good as the previous batch. The selling price was only 38-39 yuan, a sharp drop of over ten yuan compared to the previous trading.</p>
<p>The supply of vegetables has decreased sharply in recent days. The supplies of vegetables such as lion's mane and broccoli have become even scarcer. Yesterday, Longya cabbage was offered at 25 pieces at 14.5 yuan, and Wudun cabbage was offered at 40 pieces at 13.3 yuan. Merchants were very interested in purchasing them, and there may be continued price increases in subsequent trading.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Smuggled Artificial Silk Was Bought by Stockpilers</h3>
<p>Customs Must Collect Pier Dues for Goods Returned from the Interior</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty packages of Tianqiao brand smuggled goods, shipped from North China, arrived in Ningbo, at 300 yuan per package. These goods cannot be shipped elsewhere. A few dozen packages of goods labeled as North China Customs Seized Goods also arrived in this port, with the 120 package Daqiao brand priced at over 350 yuan, the 150 package Tianqiao brand priced at 360 yuan, and the 150 package Golden Ring Star brand priced at 350 yuan. These goods cannot be shipped to the interior, but they have been bought by stockpilers. The Shanghai Customs will announce a new rule requiring that pier dues be paid for all goods that are transshipped to the interior and then returned to this port, otherwise the goods will be confiscated. Next week, the Shanghai Customs will have an auction of about one hundred items.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Fine Tea Trading is Still Active</h3>
<p>--Few Transactions of Local Coarse Tea--</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of Tunxi Fine Tea was still active. Xiehe, Huacha, Fushi, Yongfa, Shilong, and other firms all purchased some. The price ranged from 90 yuan to 100 yuan. All firms sent telegrams regarding Fine Tea from Suian, but have not received a response. Fine Tea from Weiping opened at ten yuan, and Huacha, Baojing, and other firms purchased over one hundred pieces of fine tea from Suian, priced from 22 yuan to 27 yuan. Due to a shortage of high-quality products, there were few transactions of local coarse tea. The telegrams sent by various firms regarding Pingshui round tea several days ago have still not received a response. However, according to tea merchants, the cost of round tea this year is not cheap, but it is not particularly high compared to previous years. However, the opening price has already caused huge losses for exporters, and foreign firms have not responded to telegrams, indicating that this price is not in line with the foreign market. Even if there is some buying, the prices are very harsh. For example, the superior-grade goods in the yards of Jardine Matheson and Huacha were purchased in small quantities at prices of 58 to 59 yuan, which is not a formal market price.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Shipments of Ribbed Steel Bars Arrive in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Due to a shortage of goods, the price of steel bars had previously increased, with the market price reaching 134-135 yuan per ton. Recently, new shipments have arrived in large quantities. However, due to sluggish wholesale sales and weak demand from factories, the market remains sluggish and prices have fallen frequently. Currently, the market price for ordinary patterns is 125 yuan per ton, while the selling price for good-quality patterns is up to 130 yuan per ton. Yesterday, construction firms purchased 40 to 50 tons, and door factories purchased 30 to 40 tons. There were no transactions with wholesale merchants.</p>

<h3>Xiao Liu'er</h3>
<p>— Chuan Lin</p>
<p>It wasn't even dawn yet when Xiao Liu'er was woken up by his mother. Inside the house, the kerosene lamp was lit, and the millet porridge was bubbling in the pot, giving off a very pleasant aroma. His father was busy preparing things, his tall dark shadow swaying back and forth on the earthen wall, making the room a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>Xiao Liu'er's eyes lit up, and his heart blossomed. "What? Are we leaving now? Mom, it's not even light yet," he asked.</p>
<p>His mother had been telling him since the day before yesterday that they were going to the Northeast. She said the Northeast was a good place, with tile-roofed houses and plenty of rice and wheat buns to eat. The tile-roofed houses didn't matter to him, but the thought of rice and wheat buns made Xiao Liu'er very happy. He had been eagerly waiting for this day, and he was even dreaming of eating rice just now!</p>
<p>He groggily climbed out of the earthen pit, wrapped his tattered cotton jacket around him, and forgot all about the cold and fatigue. Xiao Xing'er was so annoying, still crying in her mother's arms. What was she crying about? It's not like they were sending her to the tiger's den. She would never be so stupid.</p>
<p>The family hurriedly gathered around the pit to drink porridge. Today, the porridge was cooked in a particularly large amount and tasted especially good. His father drank three bowls, his mother two, and Xiao Liu'er also drank three. His father didn't even glare at him today. He was really happy, his belly was full, and he felt warm and comfortable.</p>
<p>All their belongings were packed onto a carrying pole. The front held the stove, wok, iron rake, broken box, and broken basket. The back had a large basket containing his father's coat, loose packages, and Xiao Liu'er himself. His father carried him, while his mother carried Xiao Xing'er and a large bundle on her back. His father's face was pale, and his mother was sniffling. Xiao Liu'er was getting impatient. Adults were always so strange, never knowing any joy. Xiao Xing'er started crying again. What a nuisance!</p>
<p>Suddenly, he remembered that he had forgotten a clay figurine on the corner of the pit. That was a disaster, he almost left it behind. He ran back inside and found it, hiding it in his pocket. His father was already glaring at him.</p>
<p>They had many other people going with them, and they had to go to the village ahead to wait for everyone else. Xiao Liu'er sat in the big basket, wrapped in his father's tattered jacket. He wasn't cold! Even though the wind was blowing so hard, the basket jolted up and down, which was quite fun! The sky wasn't very bright yet, and it was gray and misty. Xiao Liu'er looked back, and his own thatched hut was getting smaller and smaller. Xiao Liu'er didn't like the thatched hut, but his father seemed reluctant to leave it. In the distance ahead was a mountain range. Was the Northeast on the other side of that mountain? Thinking of the rice in the Northeast, Xiao Liu'er's bottom bounced up and down in the basket.</p>
<p>"You little rascal, be quiet with me. You're causing trouble at this time. Your old man will beat you when we get back," his father cursed again, his face pale. Adults were really strange! They just didn't understand!</p>
<p>Rumble, rumble, rumble!</p>
<p>Xiao Liu'er climbed onto a stool, leaned against the window, and shouted, "Mom, look, this fire dragon is so fast! Look at those trees falling backwards, the mountain is turning! Scary! My God! That big iron bridge!"</p>
<p>His mother was also staring with wide eyes, Xiao Xing'er was grinning, both happy and scared. His father was looking at the dirty floor, not understanding anything! Suddenly, he raised his head and scolded sharply, "If you don't shut up, your old man will beat you to death! You…"</p>
<p>There were so many people in the train! They were packed so tightly together. There were people on the floor and on the shelves. Some were snoring, some were babbling. It was like a swarm of bees buzzing. People selling eggs and big steamed buns pushed through the crowd! The aroma went straight into Xiao Liu'er's belly, making him long for it. He wanted some, but when he saw his father glaring at him with gritted teeth, he swallowed his saliva and didn't dare to speak.</p>
<p>He hoped he would arrive in the Northeast soon.</p>
<p>He fell asleep and woke up again. Rumble, rumble, rumble, the fire dragon was still flying. Xiao Liu'er hadn't realized the Northeast was so far away.</p>
<p>It was getting late, and the outside of the window was so dark it was as if ghosts were running around. Xiao Liu'er was a little scared and didn't dare to look. "We're about to cross the border," someone said. Xiao Liu'er was happy and glanced at that person. The door on the other side opened, and a man who looked like both a foreign devil and a policeman came in, followed by two soldiers—what his father called "foreign devils." Xiao Liu'er recognized the man. He had come several times already to check the tickets. His father had one ticket, his mother had one, Xiao Liu'er had a half-price ticket because he was small, and Xing'er didn't have one because she was a little girl.</p>
<p>The man clipped the tickets and glanced at them. The "foreign devil" asked his father for something, and his father fumbled慌手忙脚 in his pockets, unable to find it. His mother stared at him anxiously. One of the soldiers slapped him across the face. Xiao Liu'er was terrified and burst into tears. Whack! A slap came to his face, making him dizzy. His father finally found what they wanted, and the two foreign devils looked at it for a long time and then returned it to him. Then they started searching the luggage, making a mess of everything. One leg of Xiao Liu'er's clay figurine was broken off. His heart ached, and he wanted to cry, but he glanced at the tall soldier and swallowed it down. His mother exhaled a big breath after they left, sweat dripping from her forehead. Xiao Liu'er didn't dare to raise his head. After a while, the two "foreign devil" soldiers dragged a person out,吵吵闹闹making a commotion. Xiao Liu'er was still wiping his red face from being slapped, not daring to say a word.</p>
<p>Rumbling... It was as if a mountain had collapsed onto the fire dragon. Xiao Liu'er jumped in fright. Something went whizzing past the window. Someone shouted, "We've crossed the border!"</p>
<p>Xiao Liu'er sighed deeply. "This is really damn awful!" Xiao Liu'er's resentment and anger were all contained in this one sentence. What Northeast with tile-roofed houses and rice! One by one, ghosts! All lying bastards! All there was here was snow. The top of the mountain looked like an old man wearing a mourning cap. The thatched hut was even worse than the one at home. The weather was so cold he was shivering, and his fingers felt like they were about to fall off. His father was walking back and forth with a bunch of people, not sure what he was doing. His face looked like a terrible ghost. His mother was constantly crying. Xiao Xing'er was sick. It served her right for coming to this awful place to die!</p>
<p>That morning, Xiao Xing'er died. His mother was crying and screaming, banging her head against the wall. His father was scolding her and losing his temper, knocking over the table. Xiao Liu'er was kicked out by his father. He sat in the snow, dazed. The gray clouds in the sky were moving like a torn sail from the north. The north wind was howling like scissors. The mountain across from him was staring at him like an evil man. Behind that mountain, Xiao Liu'er thought of his hometown.</p>
<p>A pang of sorrow arose in his heart, and two tears flowed down, freezing on his collar. He continued to stare, surrounded by endless whiteness.</p>
<h3>Star</h3>
<p>— Quan Heng</p>
<p>Lately, life has been a bit like a hurricane.</p>
<p>We use every tense muscle in our bodies to drive the windmill, making it whir loudly.</p>
<p>Work makes people forget sleep. When we are together, no one ever stretches or yawns casually. During the day, for the sake of livelihood, a few of us are able to be out in the open all day long. To compensate for this lack of work, we have to endure this heavy burden at night, under the dim lamplight, arranging it on every skeleton that has been worn out for a day.</p>
<p>Xiu's eyes are red, because she hasn't slept well for over a month. Tears often flow from Mo Shui's sick eyes. Jing's originally plump cheeks have also become sunken, naturally emphasizing her dimples. Wan has also become much more haggard than before, and work has made her silent. Only Hua, the youngest of this group, is still singing songs all day long. Her song is like a spark that starts a prairie fire, igniting everyone's hearts. How fiercely ignited are everyone's hearts! As long as we think of our constant task, as long as we think of the whirring windmill, we will not allow ourselves to utter a word of fatigue or laziness. Clenching our teeth is our duty.</p>
<p>We are a group of fireflies that fly out of every dark corner. Each of us carries a little faint light, wanting to illuminate others. For this reason, we have all gathered together. We believe that hundreds of firefly lights will turn into a spark. However, no matter where, no matter when, what we show to others is only a group of weak, faltering stars.</p>
<p>However, one day, this dark ceiling will not allow even the weak, faltering little stars to stand. The world is smeared with dark clouds by a demonic hand, like the bottom of a pot.</p>
<p>We haven't seen Wan's shadow for several evenings in a row. Where has Wan gone? Usually, regardless of illness or other matters, one of us always knows Wan's whereabouts. Yu Qin secretly went to the school where she taught, but the answer was that she had left several days ago. That day was the last day she left us. When Jing used a flashlight to see her out the door, she carefully reminded her: "The wind is very strong these days. Wan, when you go out, be sure to pull your collar up and button your coat tightly!" Wan gave everyone a determined look and nodded, telling everyone to rest assured.</p>
<p>This sharp northwest wind has snatched Wan away too abruptly and unexpectedly. When Shu Hua ran from afar and confirmed where Wan had gone, fire-like light spewed from everyone's eyes. We were angry! We shouted! We want to burn the world with the heart fire in our hearts and destroy this…</p>
<p>At the same time, like a stone pressing on our hearts, we are constantly guarding against the arrival of a giant hand.</p>
<p>Young Hua also obediently stopped her singing. She clenched her fists and said she wanted to fight to the death. We all felt this way. For our lost friend Wan, for others, and for ourselves, we have no other way but to work harder to push the windmill!</p>
<p>"Turning back? Turning back is a dead end!" We constantly use this sentence to warn ourselves!</p>
<p>At night, although we are still crowded under the dim lamplight, having lost Wan, the air is strangely quiet. The moonlight or the sound of wind from outside the window is often mistaken for something else, and we are surprised and put down the things in our hands.</p>
<p>Only the hearts in our chests are constantly beating rapidly, and a rope of fear is tightly threaded between our hearts.</p>
<p>But is the dark cloud willing to let the stars shine? (Even though that light is pitifully weak.) Misfortune finally followed in Wan's footsteps. First, Xiu was swallowed by a giant wave one morning. Following the wave was also Xiu's blind husband (how sad it is to lose this young couple!). Then, in our small common room, I couldn't find Hua.</p>
<p>A cluster of small stars is now scattered. Where have all our many close companions gone?</p>
<p>Scattered little stars! I can't write these things in more detail. I can only tell you about Wan and Xiu... They and they have all become fireflies in glass bottles.</p>
<p>However, when we raise our heads, a group of weak little stars are still stubbornly shining with faint light, and we believe that after some time, this light will turn into a spark of explosion.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of a Corner of the City</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhting</p>
<p>Electric lights shone with brilliant light, and the radio emitted waves of intoxicating music, like a mother's hand stroking a baby, offering some comfort, some indulgence. On the smooth roads, cars shuttled back and forth like looms, instantly sliding past your eyes, the sound of their wheels gradually fading into the distance, like strands of yarn, weaving into the hearts of the people waiting at the tram stop. The sky was dark, veiled in a layer of yellow haze. The March night breeze blew, making people feel bewildered.</p>
<p>The tram still hadn't arrived, and more and more people gathered, standing in a line at the station.</p>
<p>Three or four beggars repeatedly approached these people, begging with their dirty hands, murmuring:</p>
<p>"Sir, spare a copper coin!" Their voices were so low and defeated that no one paid attention to their pleas, everyone lost in their own thoughts.</p>
<p>The beggars lazily shifted their feet, begging someone else.</p>
<p>"Sir, spare a copper coin!"</p>
<p>Their faces were sallow, without any particular expression, just holding out their hands, waiting for a copper coin. Everyone shook their heads, indicating they wouldn't give anything. —Every day they needed to take the tram, every day they encountered beggars, they couldn't afford to give alms as a matter of course; if the beggars didn't leave, they would turn away, indicating refusal.</p>
<p>"Sir, spare a copper coin!"</p>
<p>One beggar stood in front of a young man in a Western suit, saying this.</p>
<p>"Annoying!—" The young man in the suit glared at him and walked away. Because those wearing suits didn't necessarily have spare money; even if they did, everyone knew that a single copper coin couldn't keep a person alive.</p>
<p>And those beggars, after each empty-handed withdrawal, remained undeterred, still so lazy, still so defeated, still not showing any resentment, slowly reaching out their hands to a young woman.</p>
<p>"Miss, give me a copper coin!"</p>
<p>"Tch! Get your filthy hands away!"</p>
<p>At this moment, a distinguished gentleman standing next to the young woman took a copper coin from his pocket and threw it on the ground with a "clink."</p>
<p>The beggar picked it up and moved on to another waiting customer. Such repeated begging failed to move anyone, no one paid attention, because everyone was used to seeing these beggars.</p>
<p>No, everyone was busy, everyone was concerned with their own joys, sorrows, gains, and losses, everyone was focused on their own desires. Even though it was night! But their bags were empty, their stomachs were empty, they still had to try one last method; even though it was night! The fatigue of the day should have given way to rest at this time, but they still had to drink a glass of baijiu, or a cup of coffee, to dispel the melancholy in their hearts; even though it was night! However, the night made them even more resentful, the night made them even lonelier, they spent a few dollars to buy a few false smiles, to buy a drunken frenzy at the bar; even though it was night! However, with no way out, it was better to risk everything in one desperate gamble. Even though it was night! However, with jazz music and bright electric lights, people became excited, life was finite, let the revelry begin, forget yourself, forget everything. Even though it was night!—Everyone was concerned with their own joys, sorrows, gains, and losses, everyone was focused on their own desires, they had no time to care about these beggars!</p>
<p>"Why hasn't the tram come yet!" Everyone looked up and strained their necks, hoping to appear as anxious as possible.</p>
<p>"Sir, spare a copper coin!"</p>
<p>This lazy cry was too small, instantly sinking into the depths of the city's noise. But the beggars were also used to the faces of city dwellers—disgust, disdain, sneers, contempt… What did it matter! City dwellers also had eyes, but the city was too dazzling, making everyone's vision blurred, unable to see ugliness and poverty clearly; city dwellers also had hearts, but the city was too tense, the tense atmosphere made everyone busy and confused. Basically, no one knew what tomorrow's world would be like. They couldn't blame heaven, they couldn't blame others, they couldn't blame themselves.</p>
<p>On both sides stood towering buildings, streets were filled with electric lights, beautiful neon advertisements shone in the sky, intoxicating music played, and cars weaved back and forth… All of this was like a brocade blanket covering a decaying corpse. And those beggars were the corpses crawling out from under the brocade blanket.</p>
<p>The tram arrived at the station with a ringing bell, spitting out a crowd of people, then swallowing another group of waiting passengers, then driving away quickly.</p>
<p>Soon, the station was full of people again, and the beggars went back and forth begging, the city was always moving like this.</p>
<h3>Modern Woman</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>The air on the small building is desolately cold: Having endured the misty dawn, the scorching midday sun, the twilight of dusk, and the starry river of the night sky. The air on the small building is desolately cold: Watching the charming spring drift away, seeing the summer wear a vicious face, watching the flowers and plants wither in autumn, broken-hearted, watching the snow wave the whip at all things. The air on the small building is desolately cold: Smiling faces, magic-like greetings—receiving vulgar merchants, receiving drunken men, and having to receive those with endless hopes with earnestness! People, swept away by the raging waves, the seasonal winds constantly changing, but the air in this eternal small building—when will it receive the light of dawn!</p>
<h3>Obscene Riddles</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>The issue of obscenity in literature; for many years, many people have discussed it, but they have all focused on novels. Last year; Feng Menglong's "Tong Chi Er Nong Shange" was discovered, allowing us to see the extent of obscenity in mountain songs. Such as "Sixteen Not Allowed" and other chapters, in the eyes of moralists, are simply unbearable to read. This has already been published in a collated edition by Gu Jiegang, issued by Chuanjingtang, which I have discussed in the magazine "Taibai." Now I just want to say something about obscene riddles.</p>
<p>For several months now, I have discovered a Qing Dynasty carved edition of a riddle collection in an old secret shop, titled "Newly Published Fashionable and Elegant Riddles, Amazing Mirror," printed by Qing Li Ge in western Liaoning, with a total of two volumes, containing ninety-eight riddles. The editor's name is Chen Meigong, which is obviously a pseudonym, because in the combined edition of "New Drinking Games" and "Laugh to the End," the terms "Great Qing Law" and "Great Qing Heaven" appear twice.</p>
<p>This two-volume book contains quite a few obscene riddles, some of which are very clever. For example, the riddle: "A thing born three inches long, one end with hair, one end smooth, put it in clean, take it out wet and juicy," it is truly obscenely remarkable, and the answer is "toothbrush." Another example is "A thing born five inches, head smooth, neck thin, worthy of praise. The beautiful woman grabs it at first sight, lifting her skirt and wanting to. Turning clouds and rain on the bed, the sound is like a pipa. It seems to be a flower, causing the formation of a fetal thread." And the answer is "cotton mallet." There is also a riddle: "Head down, waist up, hands turning back and forth, pressing and bumping. Dripping with water, sound of smacking, only stopping when water comes out." What is the answer? It's "washing clothes." The most wonderful thing is the riddle using a man's words to a woman: "Sister! Sister! Pick up your feet! A prick of the lamp, poked into the flesh!" In reality, it's talking about earrings. Although this is obscene, they are all very apt, truly as Feng Menglong said: "Scholars can think, what is not possible," there is no fixed form in elegance. However, the "sexual psychology" manifested by ordinary people in various aspects can also be seen.</p>
<p>There are also some that are slightly "elegant." For example, the riddle for "playing the flute": "Mouth kissing, tongue extended, hands tightly embracing the body. Pressing the holes and letting out breath, sobbing and making delicate sounds." Like the riddle for "fragrant note": "Exquisite and translucent, fragrant inside, accompanying the lover in the quilt. Easy to leak when moving the fire, just because there is a root struggling in the belly." There is also the riddle for "fire tube": "Once fire moves, it grabs the waist tower, kissing on the top, catching fire at the bottom." This is a bit more explicit. As for those that are not explicit and more elegant, there are also many. In fact, this type can only be considered "private love riddles." Such as the following few:</p>
<p>Lovesickness makes the bones thin, if you want to open the door, only because the lover delays me, making people tear up when they mention it. (Right, hidden umbrella)</p>
<p>Sisters are the most frivolous, wearing red and green to attract talented men. How many romantic guests have suffered, how many heads of households have been harmed. (Right, hidden dice)</p>
<p>Occasionally raised by a word (rain), turned into affection (clear) and then separated. Seeing the lover go home, leaning on the door alone, tears streaming down. (Right, hidden umbrella)</p>
<p>The whole body is as soft as cotton, often spitting jade springs on the riverbank, three or four times I refuse to marry, just because affection (clear) has been牵 by the lover for a long time. (Right, hidden waterwheel)</p>
<p>These "private love riddles" are all extremely well written. At the same time, from these two volumes of riddles, it can also be seen that people at that time quite enjoyed making fun of monks and Taoists. They often used very vulgar words to describe them. For example, hiding "Taoist crown" says: "Covered with a groove, touching the hair, touching this hole, putting in this one." For example, hiding two monks sleeping head to head says: "Two heads, two heads, two heads in the middle; two heads big, two heads small; two heads broken, two heads good; two heads smooth, two heads grassy; two heads hard, two heads upside down." They are all extremely bad. Even if it is a bit "elegant," it seems that it can only reach this point: "Burning incense at night, Sister Hongniang puts half a stick of incense on the incense stand. I thought Zhang Sheng was jumping over the wall, but it turned out to be the monk Facong. One (Right, hidden bald character)." Related to monks and Taoists, there is also the "bell" in the temple, and there is also a riddle that says: "Sitting uneasily, sleeping unpeacefully, leaning unsteadily, standing unsteadily, because it disturbs the child's heart. Until it hits a bare stick, there is a body in an instant." The sounds of "body" and "sound" are homophones. This is well done.</p>
<p>The above riddles, broadly speaking, can all be said to be within the scope of obscenity. They are specially recorded to show the obscenity of riddles. Others have been circulating to the present and are still often talked about by us. Some have long disappeared due to differences in life. In the people of that time? Xu Wenchang also liked Taoist sets. The twenty-fourth volume of "Lost Manuscripts" contains all riddles, and there are also many in "Lost Grass." Some are the same as those collected in "One Mandarin Duck Mirror." However, there are no obscene works, but the riddles are very well written. Using the "Ru Meng Ling" verse to hide the hornet, "lamp blanket," and "flower lamp" are particularly good. Here, only the "Umbrella" is left, to echo the two umbrellas in "Mandarin Duck Mirror":</p>
<p>Hearing like losing, like, paper cut, relatives and friends bamboo. The lotus canopy shadow is gracefully in the moonlight, and the sound is rustling in the rain. Sunny days are cloudy and clear, and the theory of the two days is reduced. How to get a big house in my hand, to cover the people walking east, west, north, and south!</p>

<h3>Japanese Satirical Literature – Hubris (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>Within the camp of purely literary writers, satirical literature is largely opposed. Masamune Hakucho is a proponent of opposition, and the poet Hagiwara Sakutaro (regarding satirical poetry) also holds an uncertain opinion. Masamune Hakucho initially wrote: ("Regarding Satirical Novels"): "This is the era when satirical novels should emerge. In the current world, I rarely read satirical novels that resonate with me, and I feel acutely that this is an example of a lack of talent in the literary world."</p>
<p>In this quotation, he promotes satirical literature, but he is based on nihilistic foundations, giving satire the meaning of a nihilistic contempt for humanity. In "Satirical Literature," he says: "The satire of Kinqirddson and Stel, contemporaries of Swift, is a kind of thing that wants to improve etiquette and manners, and Moliere's "Tartufe," Gogol's "Nose," their satire is profound, and from the orthodox satirist Lucian in the history of European literature to Rabelais, Cyrano, etc., their satire seems to have a rich spicy flavor, but I uniquely choose Swift because he has no insults or resentment towards mankind." In reality, Hakucho most admires Swift. "The place where I have worked the hardest in my work is in troubling the world (more than comforting it)." Therefore, he does not pay attention to the social significance of satirical literature.</p>
<p>As for Hagiwara Sakutaro, he says: "The era when satirical poetry flourished has always been an era of despotic suppression of the people's freedom. Satirical literature exists when it is impossible to engage in direct resistance, sticking out its tongue behind its back and making poisonous "mockery." A kind of weakling's revenge. That is also the "nostrils of the bound" of the powerless. It is only natural that this learning prevailed in the Edo period of Japan, and it is also only natural that new poets are promoting satirical poetry in today's era." "But satirical literature, to put it briefly, is not orthodox art, but a kind of "light literature" that focuses on light humor and taste. That is, something like the cartoons in daily newspapers, which are as disposable as confetti after a laugh. The so-called "poetry" in the true strict sense is the lyric poetry spoken of by Alan Poe." In these words, we can know his obliteration of the whole picture of satirical poetry and even literature. Needless to say, this is what a poet standing on the position of art for art's sake would say.</p>
<p>What exactly is satirical literature? What is its significance? The theoretical basis for the supporters of Japanese satirical literature is Lunacharsky's speech "On Laughter." Now, to explain the source of "satirical literature," I will excerpt some of his outstanding opinions as follows: "...Laughter calls forth the self-evaluation of the one being laughed at, and secondly, mockery, which in the eyes of the onlookers is considered just, must evoke the sympathy of the onlookers for the mockers' attempts to attack their enemies. ..." "Satire can make laughter a poisonous and stinging thing...."</p>
<p>"The laughter of satire has great significance when it is directed at the enemy's sacred precepts, at what serves as authority in the enemy's camp. ...In this way, the act of laughter becomes a powerful thing. Even to the point of doubting whether we still have other logical weapons; such satirical laughter not only subverts the enemy's policies but also demolishes what has always been considered sacred. ..."</p>
<p>In short, the above is a source of satirical literature advocated by the new progressive writer groups in Japan. We certainly believe that this is the most sincere understanding of satire; but we dare not agree with Jiang Kouyu's statement here, saying that progressive literature must embark on the path of satirical literature because of political forces, which is a counter to the negative saying of Recovery. You should know that the spirit of satire is lacking in the East and even in Germany in Western Europe; we have been too influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, always standing upright and pretending to be enlightened transformed bears; or ignoring the affairs of the floating world and remaining aloof and pure, so we can never be rich in the spirit of satire.</p>
<p>As for some writers (members of the Deletion Club), who believe that satirical literature is the only path for progressive literature, there is also room for discussion. Of course, in this current uneasy era; along with the growth of progressive literature as a product of the growth of the new humanity, it is not impossible for progressive literature to continue to make forward progress in the most skillful way; the spirit of satire cannot be erased in the dojo. We can better realize this point when we look at Tateno Nobuyuki's "Flow" and Shimazaki Toson's "Reconstruction."</p>

<p>Special Issue in Commemoration of the 28th Anniversary of the Death of Mr. Yang Sisheng, Principal of Pudong Middle School</p>
<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>— Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, Mr. Yang Sisheng regarded education to save the country as the primary goal, donated more than 300,000 of his family wealth, and founded Pudong Middle School. He resolutely said: "This small family wealth, rather than passing it on to my children, making the virtuous lose their ambition and the unworthy become more excessive, why not use it to promote education, and cultivate talents for the country"? His far-sightedness, his eagerness for public good, were rarely seen in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang was a plasterer, but he had such great aspirations and a spirit of sacrifice. In a time of great change, many people were inspired by his righteousness, and it is fitting that he be commended to the National History Museum for a biography, so that this righteous man who destroyed his family to promote education would be remembered for generations to come. Mr. Yang also played a role in the rise of new education in our country to replace the imperial examination system.</p>
<p>Pudong School is located on the banks of Liuli Bridge, with an excellent environment, sufficient equipment, effective teaching, and early achievements. Over the past thirty years, talents have emerged in large numbers, some serving in the education sector, some entering politics, and many becoming the backbone of the business community with innovative minds. Now that those in charge are capable, the school is thriving, and the nobility of Mr. Yang's spirit is becoming even more limitless.</p>
<p>Today is the 28th anniversary of Mr. Yang's death. Shen Bao has specially published a special issue in commemoration. As a director of the school, I am ashamed of my lack of contribution, but I admire the predecessors and admire them endlessly. I respectfully add a few lines to inform the people of the country, hoping that the virtuous and heroes from home and abroad will give more guidance, so that the school with a long history of thirty-two years will progress indefinitely, for the benefit of the youth and the fortune of the country.</p>
<h3>Portrait of the School Founder, Mr. Yang Sisheng</h3>
<p>Yang Jinchun, whose name was Sisheng, was from Chuansha, Wu. In his youth, he worked as a plasterer and became rich. He destroyed his family to promote education and founded Guangming Elementary School in Shanghai, which was later renamed Pudong Middle School in Pudong. He established "sincerity" and "simplicity" as the school motto. Such virtue and obscurity have not been seen in nearly three hundred years. He died on May 29th, four years before the founding of the Republic of China, at the age of fifty-eight. Yao Xijun praised: Mr. Yang's spirit will last for a thousand years, benefiting our students who enter this hall. How can we wish him longevity and health when the star of virtue suddenly falls and the wise die? I have made this portrait to spread his fame everywhere. Alas, my Mr. Yang, may you not forget us! (Details in Shanghai County Annals)</p>
<h3>A Review of Past School Affairs and Future Improvement Plans for This School</h3>
<p>— Han Juemin</p>
<p>Today is the 28th anniversary of the death of our school's founder, Yang. It coincides with the near end of the 24th year. Recalling the time since I took over the school's affairs, it has been over a year. Every time I think of the late school founder Mr. Yang's great virtue of sacrificing his family to establish the school, I feel infinite shame and trepidation regarding my responsibility towards this great legacy! Now that the 25th year is about to begin, I am taking this opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the school's affairs over the past year, in order to determine the direction and plans for future improvements. I also sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will give us their strict criticism and guidance!</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Our school was founded in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty. It has a glorious history of 22 years, and is situated in a beautiful and simple environment, which has formed various unique customs:</p>
<p>Emphasis on Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry: School founder Yang was originally an engineer with rich experience but lacking a foundation in academic theory. At the time of founding the school and establishing industrial classes, it was all in order to promote industry and cultivate engineering talents. Therefore, special attention was paid to mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Not only were the full-time teachers of mathematics, physics, and chemistry all renowned domestic teachers, but also many of the school's graduates over the past 30 years have benefited from mathematics, physics, and chemistry and are employed in the industrial sector. This has become a tradition, and most students have a stronger interest in mathematics, physics, and chemistry than in other subjects. I think the reason for this may be that the school's physics and chemistry equipment is more complete, and students can seek interest in the laboratory, rather than memorizing theorems and formulas in books. At the same time, the teaching method is not a rigid type of irrigation, but an enlightening type of induction, which is also certainly an important reason.</p>
<p>Interest in Studying: Our school is located in a rural society, and naturally lacks the temptation of external extravagance and the clamorous noise. The school buildings are spacious and comfortable, far exceeding other schools, so the students' courage to study and make progress seems to be particularly strong. Indeed, in the spring and summer seasons, every day when the east is about to turn white in the early morning, we can hear the sounds of birds chirping and leaping in the green shade of the trees, mixed with the sounds of students reading. In addition, the power of nature, such as the flowers and plants in the fields with their refreshing fragrance, pushes students to study, I think, quite a bit. Therefore, even students who love to play at our school seem to show the appearance of "there is only joy in studying here."</p>
<p>Popularization of Physical Education: As mentioned above, our school's environment is such that the sports fields are particularly spacious, unlike schools in densely populated cities. The physical education facilities are also very complete, almost everything that should be there is there. Therefore, every student automatically participates in sports after daily classes. However, there is also a biggest reason inside, that is, students here have no other boring entertainment to entice them besides sports. Therefore, our school's physical education honor can not only be maintained and promoted, but also the physical condition of each student is more popular, unlike students in urban schools who often have weak habits.</p>
<p>Diligence and Simplicity in Life: This is naturally due to school founder Yang's advocacy of the purpose of running the school and the continuous implementation of encouragement by the school authorities. School founder Yang said in the school's purpose statement: "I am ashamed to know nothing about scholarship, but since I was young and poor, and have spent half my life working in industry, I know that in all things in the world, whether it is for personal self-reliance or for social happiness, one must have perseverance and hard work to achieve one's hopes... I believe that perseverance and hard work have two aspects: one is diligence, and the other is simplicity." Therefore, the school's style of diligence and simplicity is also particularly evident in the lives of students. This is indeed due to the influence of school founder Yang's great personality, but the students' daily life close to agricultural and industrial life also has a great impact on them. Therefore, everyone is ashamed of luxury and laziness.</p>
<p>Like the various habits mentioned above, they are naturally valuable school traditions, which should be accepted and promoted. However, at the same time, in this environment, two shortcomings have been produced unconsciously:</p>
<p>Neglecting the Importance of Social Sciences: As a result of emphasizing mathematics, physics, and chemistry, social sciences, especially history and geography, have been largely neglected. Most students either think that this type of science is easy to learn, or they think that it is unimportant, neglecting its importance. This situation is naturally not unique to our school, and can be said to be common to most schools, but I personally feel that our school seems to be particularly so.</p>
<p>Not Seeking Neatness in Clothing: It is certainly something we should agree with that clothing is not sought to be gorgeous, but it seems to be a defect that one does not pay attention to appearance. Most students here do not pay much attention to external beauty, but only seek comfort and pleasure. Therefore, whenever the weather is slightly warmer, they like to wear wooden clogs, clattering, and in the cold winter, they like to wear clumsy straw sandals, which has become a habit over time and is difficult to eradicate.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>In the past year or so, in order to maintain the inherent virtues, correct the shortcomings, improve teaching efficiency, and save expenditure. We have made several improvements to the school's affairs:</p>
<p>Adopting a System of Unifying Instruction and Guidance: The school is a whole indivisible organism. The cultivation of knowledge belongs to the responsibility of the teaching affairs, and the influence of personality belongs to the responsibility of moral education. This method of division of labor and cooperation, when properly adjusted, can achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, it often leads to shirking responsibilities due to unclear authority or excessive clarity of authority, which greatly affects moral education. Therefore, since the last quarter of last year, we decided to adopt a system of unifying instruction and guidance, merging the two departments of teaching affairs and moral education into the Guidance Department. This will closely link moral education and teaching affairs, and use each other to promote the effectiveness of instruction and education. It has been a year now, and the phenomenon of shirk responsibilities hindering the implementation of instruction and education has not completely disappeared, but it has decreased a lot compared to before.</p>
<p>Adopting a Advisor System: Each class hires one full-time teacher as an advisor, who is stationed at the school all the time, first to meet the needs of students who ask questions at any time, and second to give the teacher the authority to guide and supervise, in order to exert the effectiveness of unifying instruction and education. Regarding the authority of advisors, we have formulated advisor regulations. We hold a joint advisor meeting once a month to discuss matters related to the improvement of moral education and contribute teaching opinions to the Guidance Department. After this advisor system was implemented, we received assistance in moral education, which is also very considerable.</p>
<p>Improvement of History and Geography Teaching: Although there are many history and geography teaching materials published at home and abroad, there are very few that truly meet the needs of students. They are either verbose and inferior, with difficult stories, or they suffer from formal arrangement and repetitive dryness of words. Therefore, in order to avoid this feeling of no interest, we specially hired teachers with extensive research on history and geography to compile and print lectures themselves in the past year. Not only is the writing vivid and interesting, but it also links history and geography, making it easy for students to understand and remember.</p>
<p>Revising the Student Absence Registration Method: In the past, there was a phenomenon of students being absent from class without reason. In order to prevent absenteeism without reason and free leave, we have implemented strict methods for registering absences and truancy. That is, the Teaching Affairs Section extracts the names of absentees every day based on the attendance roster of the academic program, compares them with the leave book of the Moral Education Section, and the inspection book of the moral education staff in various classrooms, and publishes them once a week. In accordance with the absenteeism punishment measures, it is strictly implemented. After implementation, the number of absences is decreasing day by day.</p>
<p>Vigorously Implementing the New Life Movement: Because many students are accustomed to being frugal, they also tend to be unkempt, especially with wooden clogs and straw sandals, which is quite unsightly. In the past year, we have vigorously implemented the New Life Movement, and all classrooms and dormitories have made great progress in neatness and cleanliness. Students wearing wooden clogs and straw sandals entering and leaving the office, classrooms, and dining hall have almost disappeared.</p>
<p>Joint Office Work: In order to save expenses and seek agility in handling affairs and economy in time. We have merged the principal's office, the administrative office, and the guidance office into a general office. All staff members go to the office on time, and there is an attendance book, which is sent to the principal or guidance director for attendance every day.</p>
<p>Others: In order to assess the progress of various items, special statistical comparison charts are compiled in spare time. In order to increase students' common knowledge, celebrities are invited to the school to give lectures every Monday. In the past year, students have made great progress in literary and artistic research, and there are several publications published on a regular basis, including "New Road," "South Beacon," "Red Light," "Broken Jade," and "Kuimen."</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>In the past year, we have spared no effort in improving the school's affairs. Every time a reform is decided, it goes through several discussions and trials. However, we still feel that there are many shortcomings. Now, in order to enrich the content and make it more perfect, we hereby propose the following future improvement plan on this day when the 25th year is about to begin:</p>
<p>The Direction of Improvement: In the past, education did not consider the issue of students' future career paths. Therefore, the elective subjects did not determine the elective courses based on social needs, so that students have employment skills, nor did they examine the changes in the courses of higher education institutions, so as to introduce the ways of general academic research. This year, the board of directors, in consideration of the issue of students' future career paths, decided that the top five students in each graduating class who do not wish to continue their studies will be introduced to work by the board of directors. Therefore, the future education policy is to focus on cultivating two types of talents: those who continue their studies and those who seek employment. (A) Regarding preparation for further studies, one is to complete the compulsory courses to qualify students as citizens, so that both physical and mental aspects can achieve sound development; the other is to introduce the ways of general academic research through elective courses, in order to cultivate interest in specialized research, so that they can happily enter higher education institutions. (B) Regarding preparation for employment, one is to enable students to receive fundamental training in the knowledge and skills of citizens and general life through compulsory courses; the other is to cultivate one or two special skills in the profession through elective courses, which will be tools for making a living in the future.</p>
<p>Teaching Affairs Plan: In the past, the school's teaching plan focused on mathematics and physics, so that the continuous teaching of algebra to calculus and plane geometry to solid geometry and analytic geometry; and divided the teaching of secondary chemistry, higher chemistry, and general physics, and higher physics. Therefore, students' knowledge and skills have invisibly created a highest record of 80% entering engineering in the index of graduation and further studies. From our current education policy, this kind of malformed development is, of course, a symbol of a bit of a morbid state, which does not meet the educational purpose of the current stage. Therefore, in order to avoid this situation, in the future teaching plan, mathematics, physics, and chemistry should be given equal importance to social sciences and vocational skills. At the same time, in order to improve teaching efficiency, it is planned to establish teaching research committees for each subject in the next semester. (A) Study the weight of this course and other courses, in order to seek a balanced development of education. (B) Study teaching methods and implement the "learning by doing" program. (C) Study how to implement the production education program, in order to adapt to the special education purpose during the national crisis.</p>
<p>Moral Education Plan: The principle of moral education is to pay attention to the development of personality and the life of the group based on the average development of young people's body and mind. In order to achieve this goal, we believe that it is appropriate to emphasize guidance and persuasion, and to lighten punishment. At the same time, in order to make students understand the importance of group life and its due obligations and powers, it is decided to vigorously implement military management from the next semester, in order to cultivate the necessary discipline and habits of group life. Therefore, in addition to the original various moral education rules, two implementation measures are specially added: (A) Positive: Stipulate reward measures to encourage extracurricular homework, in order to awaken students' sense of responsibility and cooperation. In the workshop and self-study room, students automatically formulate various covenants, so that they can automatically abide by them together, and develop self-confidence and automatic ability. (B) Passive: Those who commit offenses will be made to engage in labor service work in the youth service corps, so that they can be subtly influenced in the labor experience.</p>
<p>Implementation of Military Management: On the eve of this Second World War, especially when our nation is approaching the critical moment of life and death, national military training has become our most urgent task. Our school has been implementing military training since the 14th year of the Republic of China, but military management has not yet been implemented. It is planned to implement it earnestly from the next semester of this year. Make students understand the necessity of this group life and group discipline, and prepare for reasonable action in the Second World War and the national liberation struggle.</p>
<p>Building a Gymnasium: Our school's physical education has long been famous far and wide because of the environment. In the distance, there is the creation of a new national record for the 3,000-meter long run, and recently, we have won the championship in various ball games, but due to economic limitations, there is no gymnasium. Now, the board of directors has resolved to raise donations to build a gymnasium and forge students' healthy bodies.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Free Students: Now, the world economic crisis is deepening day by day, and our self-sufficient rural economy is also on the verge of bankruptcy. Middle-class families are already trapped by the heavy burden of tuition fees. In order to rescue young people who have dropped out of school, our school has decided to set up free student places from the next year; each class is temporarily set at one. (A total of twelve) The one who is rated as the first in performance will be announced at the end of each semester. Another twelve half-fee students are set up, and all the top twelve who are rated as A in both grades and conduct can enjoy this treatment.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>The above is our review of the past and the plan for future improvements of our school. Because of the short time, it is naturally difficult to avoid the criticism of being incomplete. People often say that "it sounds good" when they see beautiful and magnificent words, and I am afraid that what we are saying now cannot even get this impression in the hearts of readers. However, we believe that it is not in the beauty of the words, but in the difficulty of implementation. Therefore, on this day of commemorating the 28th anniversary of the death of school founder Yang, we can only do our best to abide by school founder Yang's legacy of "thinking and doing", in order to live up to the great virtue of this great man who sacrificed his family to establish the school, then our wish will be achieved.</p>
<h3>History of Pudong Middle School</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Our school was founded by Yang Sisheng of Pudong in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. It has a history of 32 years. Now, on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the death of Mr. Yang, we specially record its</p>
<p>major events to inform people from all walks of life, which I think is also something that people like to see in the midst of the national crisis. First of all, the late school founder Mr. Yang built a villa on Manpan Road in Shanghai, and hired accomplished people at that time, such as Huang Yanpei, Meng Ziquan, and Gu Bingqi. The original family school in the villa was changed into a formal school, named Guangming Elementary School, which is the beginning of our school. In the 31st year of Guangxu, Mr. Yang believed that the school was too close to the family and inconvenient to expand, and that establishing a school in the bustling concession was not a place to teach young students. He decided to spend 100,000 taels of gold to purchase more than 40 acres of land in the current school site of Liuliqiao in Pudong, named Pudong Middle School, and engaged in design and construction, and proposed 60,000 taels of silver as a fund. The new school building was completed in October of the following year. The middle school regulations were published. In January of the following year, it was transported into the new school building and began to recruit middle school students. The Guangming Elementary School was merged into the middle school and renamed the affiliated higher elementary school. In February, the first school founder announced the school's purpose, and the words "diligence and simplicity" were used as the school motto. In November, the auditorium was completed, and the school motto was hung high in the center rear of the auditorium to show the coming students. In the 34th year of Guangxu, the fund was increased to 120,000 taels, one affiliated high elementary school, and two primary elementary schools were all moved into the newly built school buildings, and the scale of the middle school headquarters became more and more grand. In total, the construction, fund, equipment, opening and other expenses in these four years were no less than 300,000 taels of gold, all of which were donated and managed by Mr. Yang alone. Before long, the results were remarkable. People at home and abroad knew that there was Mr. Yang, and they also knew that there was Pudong Middle School. The trend was followed by the world, and private individuals in the country who heard about it and destroyed their families to establish schools were constantly following suit. Successively, they received awards from the superintendent and the Qing court, but Mr. Yang was not happy. He believed that running a school was not dare to do it for the sake of virtue and fame. It is a pity that he passed away in April of the same year. After that, the board of directors was established to comprehensively manage the school's affairs. In the first year of Xuantong, the regulations were revised with reference to the regulations of the Ministry of Education's vocational middle school. The class teacher system was vigorously implemented, and several acres of new land were purchased to expand the sports field. In the second year, the elementary school was expanded again, and in the third year, the first school founder was posthumously awarded the title of Surveillance Envoy and declared to the National History Museum to establish a biography. In the first and second years of the Republic of China, several acres of gap land outside the school gate were purchased, the school gate was rebuilt, industrial specialities were added, and pre-school students were recruited. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, the emphasis was on the improvement of the curriculum and the promotion of sports. In the sixth year, the bronze statue of the first school founder was completed. In the seventh year, the school rules were revised, and graduates of the school who were admitted to the designated university were subsidized 100 yuan per year. A new garden was built around the school founder's bronze statue, named Jingyuan. In the eighth year, the length of study in middle school was changed to five years, the school year system was changed to the semester system, and ten classrooms and nine dormitories were added to the southeast corner of the elementary school sports field. The two exercise fields in the west were changed to ice rinks. In the ninth year, the periodic examination and scoring methods were abolished, and those who studied abroad were subsidized 300 yuan per year. The teachers' and staff dormitories were expanded. In the first semester of the twelfth year, staff were sent to Ning, Su, Hangzhou and other places to visit schools that implemented the new school system. The new school system was implemented on a trial basis from the second semester. First, the four school groups A, B, C, and D were changed to junior middle schools. In January of the year, the six school groups E, F, G, H, I, and J were changed to senior middle schools. The credit system was implemented. In June, the school rules were revised, and the senior high school was divided into three groups: further studies, general, and vocational. The selective employment guidance and fire alarm training were implemented. In the fourteenth year, the junior high school restored the independent position system for each subject, expanded the library, and rebuilt the laboratory. Due to the stimulation of the May 30th Massacre, military training was vigorously implemented. At the end of May of the following year, a May 30th National Humiliation Memorial Tablet was erected in front of the library. In October, Mr. Zhao Zengtao, a former director of the school, donated funds to build a swimming pool. However, since the sixteenth year, due to the situation, the school's affairs have been slightly scattered, and the improvement of the curriculum has never been relaxed. In the twenty-third year, the senior high school graduation examination won the first school and the first individual. Since the board of directors was reorganized in April of the same year and Mr. Du Yuesheng and others were hired by the Education Bureau as directors, it has gradually been on track. In February of the twenty-fourth year, Mr. Han Juemin was hired by the board of directors as the principal. Based on his revolutionary spirit, he strived for rectification, and not only made great improvements in teaching, but also achieved remarkable results in the rectification of the school's style. Last year, the senior high school graduation examination won the first individual again. Since the opening of the school, the number of students who have graduated, excluding elementary and junior high schools, has reached more than 1,400. The Liuliqiao, which was once full of smoke and white dew, is now a place for students to relax and study. Although the future development is infinite, and when thinking back to Mr. Yang's heart of destroying his family to establish a school, there must be something that arises spontaneously!</p>

<h3>Demanding That Diplomas Be Redeemed</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The graduating students of various universities in Beiping have initiated the organization of a Service Movement Grand Alliance, and have held two preparatory meetings to carry out various activities. The purpose of the alliance is to request the government to distribute appointments. This is indeed a very legitimate movement, a very urgent movement, but also a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>Not counting the unemployed college students of the past, just looking at the statistics of unemployed college students across the country in the twenty-second and twenty-third years, it has reached more than 9,600. Adding this year's graduating students, the total is no less than 14,500 people. May I ask, can the economic, mental, and time costs consumed by such a large number of college students still be calculated with numbers? And the result is that they are scattered in society and become a group of high-level hooligans. What a great loss and sacrifice this is for our country.</p>
<p>Last year, there was a similar group, the so-called Vocational Grand Alliance, which shouted the slogan of graduation is employment and held the banner of the movement. However, the result of their efforts was only to get a few empty names such as the establishment of a job consulting office and a job referral office, and they did not get a practical solution at all. Therefore, the organization of this group is more advanced, and it is requesting the government to distribute appointments, rather than letting them give empty words to shirk their responsibility. This method is originally correct. Otherwise, it will become a repetition of the Vocational Grand Alliance last year.</p>
<p>However, looking at the current government and various agencies, there is no place where people are not exceeding their duties, and the places for setting up official positions for people are unknown. Moreover, when the national and social economy are shrouded in a depression, where is there any way to think? And most of the people who are eating now are "this horse has a big origin," and it is not good to remove the people who are eating now and replace them with a batch of college students to eat. This is absolutely impossible. Not to mention China, the cry for unemployment is spreading across the country and the world. Even if foreign college students want the government to appoint them completely, the situation is impossible. In short, the unemployment problem is not unique to college students, but college students are talents who have already been successfully cultivated, and it is even more regrettable if they are unemployed.</p>
<p>However, I have some opinions, which may be random words. I think that college students now must not rely on the government to eat. Those who rely on the government to eat are college students without ambition. The current world is a world of self-reliance and self-salvation. Not only must the country be self-reliant and self-salvation, but the people must also be self-saved. Among a large number of unemployed college students now, I think there are many excellent specialized talents of all kinds. Everyone can base on what they have learned, carefully study various crafts, industries, or literature, and create some deeds to make society use and to make everyone admire, or individuals can create it themselves, or the majority of comrades can gather to create it together. In countries with backward industries and commerce now, it is not known that they can get a way to live in this way. In this way, not only can personal life be resolved, but the country and society will also be blessed.</p>
<p>As for group actions, there are indeed very good places, but there are also very bad places. In any group, there must be several key members who issue instructions. Assuming that these key members are used by people or achieve their goals, then the group is equivalent to loose sand, or even disintegrates invisibly. This kind of situation is not uncommon in my view. If so, the organization of a large group is nothing more than a tool for a few people, and most people are just waving the flag outside the door. Therefore, the phenomenon of group action is nothing more than this. Now, the Service Movement Grand Alliance organized by various universities in Beiping has many good intellectuals, and there may not be such a phenomenon, but we must also prevent it from happening.</p>
<h3>Li Dun'er</h3>
<p>— Zhuo'er</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Don't you even recognize this character? Heh..."</p>
<p>The teacher's face was as stern as a sheet of iron, cold and hard, his eyes staring unblinkingly, as if afraid the character might run away. But the student just sniffed, remaining silent, head bowed, fiddling with the greasy, shiny corner of his clothes. He didn't move, as if he hadn't heard a thing.</p>
<p>At this time, the other children were excitedly making faces at each other, some secretly gesturing at him, grinning at him, pulling at their cheeks with their thumbs to shame him… In short, the children were happy because they all anticipated a wonderful show about to unfold!</p>
<p>"Are you mute, huh? Li Dun'er, Li Dun'er... Why don't you answer?" Then, the rattan cane slammed against the desk with a loud "Bang!" "Come here!"</p>
<p>The student slowly dragged his feet to the podium, head bowed, silent, folding and unfolding the greasy corner of his clothes. …</p>
<p>"Eight!"</p>
<p>The crisp sound was followed by a burst of laughter. The rattan cane had raised a jujube-sized bump on Li Dun'er's head. He only grunted, saying nothing. Then, "Eight!" "Eight!" "Eight!"... An overwhelming sense of injustice made him burst into tears, which brought another round of laughter from everyone.</p>
<p>"You're still crying? Hey, turn your head around and let people see your ugly mug,</p>
<p>the way you look, you..."</p>
<p>Saying that, the teacher grabbed the top of his head and twisted it outwards. Everyone burst into laughter, and he himself chuckled with a "Humph."</p>
<p>"You're still laughing! You're still laughing! ... Laugh! ... Laugh! ..."</p>
<p>"Eight!" "Eight!" "Eight!"</p>
<p>Then he cried again in anger.</p>
<p>Li Dun'er was always bullied like this at school.</p>
<p>His father ran a small restaurant. He knew the value of education, but as soon as Li Dun'er was dismissed from school, he would call him to help with the bellows, buy vegetables, deliver food... He was busy until nightfall—this was his homework at home.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Good job, Li Dun'er is delivering food again, acting as a little waiter!..." Whenever classmates ran into him, they would jump around, shouting and making a fuss.</p>
<p>"Hey! Li Dun'er, bring me a bowl of Yangchun noodles!... Haha..."</p>
<p>Hearing his classmates shout, he would always remain silent, head bowed, and walk past as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. Another semester was coming to an end. Li Dun'er was still the same, the only progress being a few more bumps on his head from the rattan cane, and his soiled clothes were shinier than ever.</p>
<p>One day, during a memorial week, the principal specifically called Li Dun'er to the podium and scolded him in front of the whole school. In the end, he said, "Children, should our school have this worthless child? We shouldn't! When the inspectors come, they'll almost die of anger when they see this thing (pointing at Li Dun'er). In fact, the reputation of our entire school is ruined by this thing..." So, the principal announced on the spot that he was expelling him.</p>
<p>The next day, Li Dun'er cried and came to see the principal with his father.</p>
<p>"What, you're bringing this thing here again??" the principal shouted.</p>
<p>"Sir... Sir, please teach the child a little more..." his father said sincerely, with a smiling face, his hands clasped in front of his chest, as if about to bow.</p>
<p>"What, teach him? This kind of child can't be taught! Can't be taught!</p>
<p>"Sir, it's not easy for poor people to go to school. We've spent the money; can't he continue to study?"</p>
<p>"Look at all this trouble you're causing! Having a student like this in our school will simply ruin us! ...Look, look!" The principal pointed to the other clean and beautiful children and said, "These are the kind of students we want in our school! Look, look at Li Dun'er. He's so stupid. How can he amount to anything? How can he..."</p>
<p>Before the principal could finish speaking, he ran into his office.</p>
<p>For a long time, Li Dun'er's father stood there, not moving a muscle. Later, two tears fell from his old eyes. He led his child out of the school, choking as he said:</p>
<p>"Dun'er,... you should,... be… be reborn into a rich family… that would be right…".</p>
<h3>Hanging the Sign</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>Holding the end of a cigarette, peering through the 250-degree toric lenses, from the compartment—the latticed glass window of the consulting room—he saw the two pots of Cymbidium goeringii orchids on the stone bench in the courtyard, already withered. Several large and small, differently shaped silver shields on the long table were clearly not as dazzling as before. On the wall, Wu Changshuo's flower paintings and Pu Wenqiu's calligraphy, the "Huangdi Neijing" (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) and "Bencao Gangmu" (Compendium of Materia Medica) neatly arranged on the bookshelf like bricks, and the ancient porcelain water container and large inkstone on the table… were all immersed in bottomless loneliness.</p>
<p>Bottomless loneliness enveloped the newly licensed physician Lu Huichun in his cold palace-like consulting room. From morning to noon, from noon to night, not a single patient's hand had rested on the small pulse pillow. He had printed number tickets and prescription slips, with Qi Ming's name written in Yuan Kewen's calligraphy. The seal in oracle bone script, the exquisite Lian Shi paper, but he hadn't used a single sheet. His children had tried taking a few sheets to fold monkeys, fold small boats, fold flying sparrows…</p>
<p>"Little devil, I spent money to print these for you to play with! I'll chop off your hand." He had also cursed them fiercely. But hadn't he himself sometimes used them to wipe the table? In his heart, he couldn't help but chuckle, but then, a series of sorrows followed closely behind. The hands of the clock were ignorant,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Moving from ____ to ____, from ____ to ____,... Physician Lu Huichun's heart was scorched, like the Cymbidium goeringii orchids in the courtyard. Every day, every day, he always read the newspaper from beginning to end, without missing a single word, not even the advertisements. He constantly listened for the sound of the copper bell on the door, hoping that a patient would come in. Even if they didn't pay a consultation fee, at least he wouldn't lose face.</p>
<p>But each time, it was disappointment, disappointment, disappointment… "Patients, can't I go out and pull them in?"</p>
<p>"Don't pull, but where will the monthly expenses come from? You have to think of a way, otherwise, you might as well remove the sign, so you don't have to… so you don't have to worry. Isn't the rent going to be 20 yuan soon? Think about it!" Physician Lu Huichun's wife often recited this to her husband like a lesson. The reason was that the money spent on hanging the sign had come from her efforts. Preparing wine, buying furniture, renting a house, asking for calligraphy and paintings… a display of extravagance, only to be admired by themselves. When Physician Lu Huichun was in a bad mood, he would quarrel with his wife.</p>
<p>"Remove the sign? You can say it so easily, but I can't bear to lose face. You ignorant woman!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, the woman would sob and cry. "...No business...It's not...It's not my fault... I harmed you... You have no conscience... You've wasted your education..." She babbled as she cried. At this time, Physician Lu Huichun felt like a million ants were crawling around in his heart. He dropped the "Medical Classic Original Meaning," stood up, and his eyes moistened behind the 250-degree lenses. From the woodblock books, he had learned the "Yellow Emperor's Medical Way," but he had never learned how to secure a stable life? The hopes he had when he first hung the sign had completely faded.</p>
<p>"Who has harmed whom? In any case, in this unlucky situation, everything is terrible! What's the use of crying? Tears aren't medicine for poverty." But his own tears almost fell.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected afternoon when Physician Lu Huichun himself was carrying a teapot to the hot water stall when a patient came. "Sir, can I see the doctor here?" A series of "Yes, yes, yes…" came from his mouth. So, for the first time, a patient's hand rested on the new small pillow, and a pulse record was written on the prescription slip for the first time, and the medicine was prescribed with "Seven Purple Three Sheep." He was so careful in seeing the first patient in the three months since he hung the sign.</p>
<p>Four double silver coins were left on the table. Physician Lu Huichun didn't know how to cherish them enough.</p>
<p>Broadcasting, radio drama scripts</p>

<p>Jinghong: Don't worry, I won't make a person's carelessness feel too bad. Dajun: Miss, you are truly generous. You are making me feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Then how can I make you not feel embarrassed? Do you want me to scold you a couple of times?</p>
<p>Dajun: If you were to scold me with a straight face, I think I would feel much better than I do now.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Are there really people with such strange psychology in the world?</p>

<p>Hu Zhangzhao "Analects - Governing"</p>
<p>Traffic (1300) 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Zizhang was learning to seek an official position. The Master said, "Hear much and put aside the doubtful points, and speak cautiously about the rest; then you will seldom commit mistakes. See much and put aside the things that seem perilous, and carefully practice the rest; then you will seldom have occasion for repentance. When one's words are seldom open to censure, and one's actions are seldom open to repentance, office is naturally secured."</p>
<p>Duke Yuan asked, "How is it to be done in order that the people may obey government?" Confucius replied, "Advance the upright and set aside the crooked, then the people will obey. Advance the crooked and set aside the upright, then the people will not obey."</p>
<p>Ji Kangzi asked how to cause the people to reverence their ruler, to be faithful to him, and to go on to nerve themselves to virtuous action. The Master said, "Let him rule over them with dignity; then they will reverence him. Let him be filial and kind to all; then they will be faithful to him, Promote the good and instruct those who are deficient; then they will eagerly seek to be virtuous."</p>
<p>Someone addressed Confucius, saying, "Why are you not engaged in the government?" The Master said, "What does the Shujing say of filial piety?—'You are filial, you discharge your brotherly duties. These qualities are displayed in government.' This, then, also constitutes the exercise of government. What need is there of that other exercise?" The Master said, "I do not know what can be done with a man who is untrustworthy. How can a large cart be made to go without the yoke-bar for the oxen, or a small cart without the linchpin?"</p>
<p>Zizhang asked whether the affairs of ten ages after this could be known. Confucius said, "Yin followed the rites of Xia: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Zhou followed the rites of Yin: wherein it took from or added to them may be known. Some other may follow Zhou, but though it should be at the distance of a hundred ages, its affairs may be known."</p>
<p>The Master said, "For a man to sacrifice to a spirit which does not belong to him is flattery. To see what is right and not do it is want of courage."</p>

<p>Suzhou Night Talk</p>
<p>In scenic Suzhou, with its beautiful mountains and clear waters, in a corner of one of the small halls adjacent to the hotel, four male students and one female student are diligently painting. This is because the old painter Liu Shukang specially brought them from faraway Beijing to study the beauty of this great nature. Here, they can see the moon like the walls of Rome, the waters of the streets like Venice, the boats like gondolas, and the women on the boats like Gypsies. How poetic and full of material for studying painting this is!</p>
<p>But you probably don't know yet? This old painter is a pitiful man who has lost his family and carries deep wounds in his heart!</p>
<p>But now, he has Yang Xiaofeng, a girl who has never had a father and recognizes this old painter as her father! She is also the most promising, lively, and innocent girl among his male and female students...</p>
<p>To be honest with you! This happened more than a decade ago. This old painter also had a wife, and she was also from Suzhou! Not only a wife, but also a daughter! If she were still alive, wouldn't she be just as lovely as Xiaofeng now?</p>
<p>But at that time, he was too obsessed with art! He wanted to dedicate most of his life to painting this "Great Wall" to symbolize the great spirit of our nation. He painted for a full five years, until one of the most cursed civil wars in which two warlords fought over Beijing. But his home, his studio, became the target of the warlords' artillery fire. For the sake of art, he stubbornly guarded his five years of work, the painting that wasn't yet finished. He told his wife and daughter to escape first... Later, the painting became a sacrifice to the ruthless artillery fire. From then on, the old painter could no longer find his beloved wife and clever, nimble daughter!</p>
<p>...At this moment, he can truly see his daughter who disappeared more than a decade ago! Can't you hear it? The flower girl is singing the song that her father taught her when she was little, the song that she loved to sing most: "Lightly flowing Yangtze River water, lingering farewell feelings; though fallen flowers have regrets, they fall to the ground without a sound." Do you want to know everything about the flower girl's mother, who is also the old painter's wife, ... all that has happened? Then please listen to our program on the radio!</p>

<p>Wind and rain continued through the night, the iron horses were noisy. The beautiful flowers and branches are lonely in the Grand View Garden. There is silence in the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. There is one, a beautiful woman suffering from illness, hanging with double tears. Heart eager. Tears hanging. Voice silent. Night long. Listen, the sound of drums and gongs is one sound beyond the wall. The maid Zichan met at Qin Fang Zha. Why so sad like this? That Xiao, an ignorant maid directly tells the truth. Bao Erye has a wedding tonight. The young husband and wife are reunited. Only you, the Xiaoxiang Concubine, are deceived. Hear a word. Gut broken. A burst of sadness and sourness. It's like a thousand steel knives piercing the heart. Steps staggering, heart trance. Walking through a familiar garden is like a strange road. Fortunately, confidante maid Ziyuan. Supporting each other back to Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Burn that old handkerchief and new poems together. Maidenly articles are not transmissible. Now lying sick in bed. She has always been out of touch with medicine. Heart disease is difficult to cure with heart medicine. Sadly goes to the Yellow Spring in the wind and rain. Left the world with unfulfilled fate.</p>

<h3>Thrilling "Father and Son Heroes"</h3>
<p>As the curtain of night had just covered the earth, the staff of "Father and Son Heroes" at the Yihua Studio were already active.</p>
<p>A large set of a dilapidated temple more than ten feet tall, surrounded by lush, towering trees, fully brought out a gloomy and terrifying scene.</p>
<p>In addition to the actors Wang Yin, Wang Naidong, Wang Cilong, Wei Heling, Jiang Xiu, Wang Zhongkang, Guan Hongda, and fifty or sixty other extras, there were also more than a hundred enthusiastic armed comrades sent by the Security Bureau to help with the performance, as well as sixteen motorcycles with hand-held machine guns mounted, four machine guns on the ground, and three patrol cars equipped with searchlights.</p>
<p>Around 9:00, all the preparations were completed, and then the play began amidst the utmost dangerous tension. Suddenly, the sharp sound of gunfire was like a string of pearls, waking up the nearby residents from their dreams one by one.</p>
<p>Dry sand and dust rolled, deafening bullets flew, and strong searchlights shone. People shouted, and horses neighed. The scene was frightening.</p>
<p>The play ended at 3:00 AM. Although it was only five hours, nearly three hundred bullets were consumed. The state of tension can be imagined. Naturally, the Yihua authorities expressed their utmost gratitude to the comrades of the Security Bureau for their enthusiasm in supporting the film industry.</p>

<h3>Boris Karloff, the Mad Scientist, and Zombie Rocha Qian Co-Star in "X-Ray"</h3>
<p>Grand Shanghai Today's Premiere</p>
<p>The five little pearls in the realistic film "Five Blessings Come to the Door," which is being shown at the Da Guangming, were born in Callander, Ontario, Canada, on May 28, 1934. The first day that the Da Guangming showed the film was May 28, 1936, which happened to be their second birthday. The matter is really too coincidental.</p>
<p>The beautiful star Margaret Sullavan, known for her tragic roles, has now changed her style and is playing comedy. "Warm Enemies," which is now playing at the Cathay, is a love comedy that she recently starred in at Paramount. The male lead who is co-starring with her, Henry Fonda, is her ex-husband. It is a bit "that" for a divorced couple to be acting together and acting in a passionate love comedy.</p>
