<p>— 柳</p>
<p>自廢兩改元以至前日新輔幣之發行幣制改革可謂已吿一段落惟是我國幅員廣大民情複雜風習互殊遇有改革欲望其於短時間內得吿完成自非易易新幣制之施行數月于茲而邊遠省分若甘肅省府近且呈請中央迅由中央銀行在甘州凉州等處添設分行推行法幣則在寗夏新疆靑海諸省如望法幣普及自更有待于籌劃矣</p>
<p>一國貨幣之流通與治權有密切之關係邊境省分强鄰窺伺在經濟侵略猛進之今日外幣勢力允易侵入且舊時幣制所以爲經濟發展之障碍者正以省自爲政不相統一貨幣呈凌亂無序之象今欲使法幣普及于全國完成統一幣制之使命則同時自亦不能不注意于政治上之努力再就輔幣言之舊時之圓角在法價何嘗不爲十進制銀重七錢二分爲圓而一角之重爲七分二厘合十角爲一圓銅幣則以十文者百枚二十文者五十枚合一圓然卒從其實價行使者固爲政府之能發不能收無由維持其法價要亦由於鑄幣之不能統一各地方羨於鑄餘之優厚無不設廠開爐自鑄中央旣無如之何一時輕幣雜質充斥於市供過於求兌價大跌致有銀圓一枚可換銅元三百枚之兌價甚有遠過於此者故此後關於鑄幣之統一幣量之調節幣値之維持固當注意弗懈卽私鑄贋造應亦隨時嚴密偵査無使發現蓋鈔票之爲紙印無論已卽以二百八十餘元一担之鎳與二十辨士一盎斯之銀而言其成本孰重利益孰優此固不煩言而决雖以幣材堅硬模型精細倣造爲難然大利所在奸宄生心國人卽懼嚴懲而不敢輕易嘗試國外則固門戶洞開隨時隨地皆有輸入之可能爲幣與眞幣往往所差僅在毫末幾微之間爲一般人所不易辨別設竟朦混流入爲害實非淺鮮此則關吏及各地公安局所當加意査察嚴厲取締庶能保障新貨幣之信譽也</p>
<p>抑允有進者我國以社會生活程度至低對小額貨幣之需要允切例如去年總結賬期間一元鈔票竟無從兌得角票有以九五相兌換其供給之缺乏需求之股切可以想見此决新輔幣之發行當必能估計於事先作充實之準備不至再有欲兌無從之苦雖法文規定得向中中交三行爲無限制之兌換但人民日用零星所需决無隨時向三行兌換之理勢必求之於兌換店往昔兌價之高低操之於兌換業之手一轉移間有利可沾今則幣値皆爲十進兌換業無從取益勢必於兌換時巧立名目如持一圓之票向兌換店兌取角票者須貼水一分換言之一圓僅可得角票九角九分也此一分之損失在行使者固覺爲意外在兌換業自亦不肯盡其無費兌換之義務故欲使雙方皆無所損失不得不有通盤籌畫廣設或委托兌換機關俾民間悉能依照法價兌用至於人民生活方面縱不無因十進輔幣之推行而增加其負担例如向售銅元一枚者今則須售半分則爲舊銅元之一枚半售兩枚者售一分則當舊銅元之三枚零星物品價格已見提高然新幣制之推行果能日進有功使物價安定民生改善則一時間之損失當亦人民所樂於忍受也</p>

<p>華盛頓參院外交委員會主席民主黨參議員畢德門、今日已開始共久已蓄意之演說、在參院議塲中攻擊日本之外交政策、稱之爲威脅美國、並違反中國之門戶開放政策、按畢氏於去年十二月間曾在拉維加斯之扶輪社中、間接指稱日本爲「國際海盜」、繼復自作批評、聲稱報紙所傳彼之演詞、頗有數處未盡準確、惟彼將於參院議塲中詳細解釋彼之態度、今日畢氏之演說、力主美國維持强大之海空勢力、「至舉世皆能尊敬並遵從和平條的之時爲止」、</p>
<p>彼以爲日本之對華態度已破壊九國公的、且謂如接受日本之三項合作辦法、中國卽爲最後屈伏、一月二十三日、華盛頓某報曾載日本第一艦隊司令高橋中將謂美國之海軍計劃、應以國防爲範圍、吾則卽須準備日本戰艦擴展太平洋中之巡弋距離云云、畢氏對之亦大肆攻擊、謂「近世歷史上向未見有如此地位之要員、而自動發表此等不合外交之荒誕言論者、彼且威嚇美國、據稱如不能順從彼之要求、日本卽將增加海軍、蓋高橋以爲日本之海軍强大、美國將不能保護其商業、然國會當不致因此而放棄國防、或對華貿易之保護也」、</p>
<p>畢氏復謂日本之宣傳家、欲以欺人之文字、蒙蔽愛好和平之美國人民、而以戰爭之威脅、阻止美國國會採取適當之手段云、最近畢氏於日本協會中演說、亦稱日本駐美大使齋藤論及日本之對華政策時、顯欲使美國人民及政府關於此事不能多所評論、蓋齋藤以日本之亞洲政策、擬諸美國之門羅主義、並謂美國之門羅主義、亦係欲保存拉丁美洲之各民主國、而不欲使之毀滅、然吾入固迄未僭稱有征服及控制之權也」、</p>
<p>畢氏謂日本現爲海陸軍人所把持、以致滿洲之門戶、對美已經關閉、「美國之商人銀行家進口商等、皆被逐離滿、而以日本代之、卽美國之敎育家及宣敎師等亦將不能久居、倘征服者皆藉口需要律、而違背對於國聯盟的·凱洛公的·及九國公的之神聖諾言、則日本亦何必對於維持門戶開放之諾言、慮其不可破壊耶」、</p>
<p>畢氏對於散布欺人之宣傳一點、尙明白攻擊大阪每日新聞之華盛頓訪員河上、因河上最近著文稱美國倫敦海會首席代表史丹萊、曾與他國代表協議、倘與日本有所爲難、美國艦隊當在亞洲海中與日本戰爭云云、畢氏謂此說已經史氏自倫敦來電吾認、且河上尙稱美國堅持門戶開放政策、雖與日本開戰、亦所不計、其實此語已證實齋藤大使及高橋中將之言論、蓋「中國之門戶、對美早已關閉、卽使開戰、亦必使其成功、不見夫朝鮮之征服、吾人猶未遺忘、滿洲之征服、尙在吾人目前、而日本在華北之行動、已接踵而起矣」、</p>
<p>畢氏對於現在審議中之中立法、謂美國並不擬在和平時期中、放棄海上之自由、且該法亦明白保留國際公的所規定之一切戰時權利云、畢氏演說之時、參院旁聽席上、擁擠異常、掌聲雷動、演說畢後、歡呼之聲大起、甚至主席不能禁阻、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>畢德曼演詞中、又述及海洋自由問題、謂日本某作家曾稱、美國準値放棄海洋自由之原則、實非眞相、美國並無採取此種政策之意、亦並不承認任何政府、在靖平時代、得在大海上、卽美國海岸三英里以外、行使其權力也、吾人現所準備之中立措置、係在現行國際法範圍之內、將美國一切權利、予以維護而重申之、此在平時如是、卽在戰時、亦莫不然、凡在戰時、美國若認爲有益、得以按照中立法向共人民施行若干種限制辦法、惟此種辦法、非謂外國政府、卽有權使美國人民接受困難、亦非謂美國政府、已不復有權得以採取所認爲適當之辦法、以全力援助其人民、此則外國政府所當了解者也云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>波拉亦認武力為條約後盾</p>
<p>華盛頓國務院今日竭力聲明與參院外交委員會主席畢德門、發表之演說無關、國務總理赫爾宣稱、余尙未得讀畢氏演說全文、畢氏雖居政府立法機關之要職、但其發表演說之前、絕未徵余意見、余實無加以批評之必要云、赫爾並絕對否認負有任何責任、或事前得悉此項演說、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>— 昂若</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議，日本已實行退出，而英美法意四國，則已成立妥協。但海軍問題已成積重難返之局，此次談判雖成亦無多大關係；至於日本，雖已絕裾而去，其海軍政策，仍不能不受英美等國之影響，蓋各海軍國所處地位，有如連鎖，不容單獨行動也。爰將英美日法意五國海軍實力，截至去年底為止，作一比較如下：</p>
<p>（一）主力艦（戰鬥艦及戰鬥巡洋艦）</p>
<p>英國現有十五艘，其中三艘已陳舊，八艘將於本年達服役年限，另一艘則於明年達服役年限。（據一九三〇年倫敦海軍條約所規定，戰鬥艦服役年齡為二十年）其餘三艘，係一九二〇年與一九二七年所造者。</p>
<p>美國現有十五艘，其中三艘已陳舊，四艘將於本年達服役年限，一艘則於明年達服役年限，其餘七艘係造於一九一八年至一九二三年之間，故最新者已屆滿十二年。</p>
<p>日本現有九艘，其中四艘已陳舊，二艘將於明年達服役年限，其餘三艘係造於一九一八年至一九二一年，故最新者已屆滿十四年。</p>
<p>上述三國現在均未開造新戰鬥艦，且亦未有此項計畫。</p>
<p>法國現有九艘，其中七艘已陳舊，二艘將於本年達服役年限，在建造中者有三艘，擬造者有一艘。（二萬六千五百噸者二艘，三萬五千噸者二艘。）</p>
<p>意國現有四艘，其中三艘已陳舊，其餘二艘即所謂「袖珍式戰鬥艦，」根據凡爾賽和約所限制，各為一萬噸。在建造中者有三艘，其中二艘，各為二萬六千噸，第三艘袖珍式戰鬥艦為一萬噸。</p>
<p>（二）巡洋艦</p>
<p>英國現有五十四艘，其中二十二艘已陳舊（巡洋艦年齡為十六年，但根據倫敦條約所規定，一九一九年底以後所造者，為二十年。）在建造中者有九艘，擬造者三艘，其中二艘已招標承造。至就噸數言之。九千噸與一萬噸之間者十七艘，八千噸與九千噸之間者二艘，七千噸者七艘，其餘則更小。</p>
<p>美國現有二十六艘，其中一艘已陳舊。九千噸與一萬噸之間者十五艘，七千噸者十一艘，已在建造中者十二艘，均係補充萬噸巡艦者。（其中二艘尚未開造。）</p>
<p>日本現有四十艘，其中十一艘已陳舊。（五艘已屆三十五年。）在建造中者三艘，擬造者一艘，至其噸數，九千噸與一萬噸之間者十二艘。八千噸與九千噸之間者二艘。七千噸左右者五艘。在建造中與擬造之四艘則各為八千五百噸。</p>
<p>法國現有十七艘，其中四艘已陳舊。在建造中者五艘，各為七千六百噸。其已造成者七艘，各為一萬噸。七千噸至八千噸者四艘，另有舊艦一艘，為一萬一千噸。此外法國尚有二千噸與二千六百噸之間之淺水艦三十艘。（據倫敦條約所規定，此項淺水艦亦列為巡洋艦，但法國幷未批准此約。）在建造中者二艘，各為二千八百八十四噸。</p>
<p>意國現有二十七艘，其中十一艘已陳舊。在建造中者，七千噸與八千噸之間者三艘。已造成者，一萬噸者七艘，八千噸至九千噸者一艘，五千噸至六千噸者八艘。</p>
<p>德國現有六艘，各為六千噸。（一艘五千四百噸，）在建造中者二艘，均為一萬噸。</p>
<p>英國現有八艘，其中一艘已陳舊。二萬二千噸左右者四艘，建造中者一艘，噸數相同。</p>
<p>美國現有四艘，其中一艘已陳舊。三萬三千噸者二艘，在建造中者三艘，其中二艘均為二萬噸左右。</p>
<p>日本現有六艘，其中一艘已陳舊。二萬六千九百噸者二艘，一萬四千噸與一萬七千噸者各二艘。在建造中者二艘，擬造者一艘。</p>
<p>法意兩國均無未達年限之航空母艦，惟法國根據倫敦條約所規定，有一萬噸航空母艦一艘。</p>
<p>（三）潛水艇</p>
<p>英國現有五十一艘，其中十四艘已陳舊。（根據倫敦條約所規定，潛水艦年齡為十三年。）在建造中者九艘。</p>

<p>意國現有六十四艘，其中十一艘已陳舊。在建造中者十三艘。</p>

<h3 id="c107">法租界納稅會　堅决反對電話按次收費 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>函法公董局請予駁復　歷舉其不合事理之點　反覆駁詰其何以自解</p>
<p>本市法租界納稅華人會、以上海電話公司將改收費制度、際此世界經濟極度恐慌之下、殊屬不合事理、特於昨日臚列理由、函請法租界公董局採納、予以駁復、原文如下、『逕啟者、查上海電話公司更改收費制度、將由貴局董事會、於本月十五日作最後之研究、以憑取决、事關市民經濟、復足以影饗整個商業之興衰、已引起全市市民之注意、該公司新訂按决收費章程、大率根據過去之統計、作一變相之加價、此種</p>
<p>取巧辦法已爲電話用戶所堅持反對、貴局對此問題、想能容納輿情、作精密之研討、而予以駁復、茲將該公司此决變更價率未合事理之點、臚陳於下、藉供貴局採聽焉、查電話爲公用事業、束西諸邦、咸歸國營、良以純爲便利人民爲目的、斷非專爲利潤之他項商業可比、今上海電話公司、原有三萬六千架之收益、不能獲得年利一分之利率、必期</p>
<p>凑足四萬架之收益、硬將四萬架之負擔、分配於三萬六千架之用戶、於是必須加價、乃改變收費制度、以達其目的、設將來原有之三萬六千架用戶之數量减削時、則允將增加所剩用戶之負擔、其所必須維護一分利率之根本觀念、至爲謬誤、此不合事理之點一也、查該公司自民十七接辦以來、歷年盈餘、恒在數十萬以上、良因擴展資本、致應有之利息、不能發給、但在公司營業之考核、並未虧折、設該公司能按照實際情形、逐步擴充、則其必欲獲得之一分利率、亦非難致、迺該公司將以二十萬架電話之設備、而欲取償於數萬架之用戶、此種背乎經濟學原理之措施、不啻對電話用戶</p>
<p>妄加榨取以完成其計劃、此不合事理之點二也、查該公司所訂之價格、究竟如何始稱適當、至難確定、此種統計之材料、應考證全市各項生產事業之隆替、方爲凖確、目前整個世界經濟極度恐慌之下、百業俱衰、而該公司今强求其</p>
<p>衆枯獨榮此種慾望、在事實上斷不可能、蓋社會經濟有連鎖關係、任何事業、不能獨異、此次該公司之改變收費辦法、用以計劃將來則可、欲行之於不景氣之今日則不可、今該公司未察社會狀况、而作閉門造車之舉、此不合事理之點三也、查該公司收費新章內容、訂爲住宅電話每月六元五角、通話一百决爲限、商業電話每月十元、通話一百五十决、逾此則均須每决收費三分、表面觀之、似尙公允、按决收費、世界各國固有成例、惟其限制之嚴、</p>
<p>收費之苛則非他邦所可比擬也、按住宅電話百决之通話費爲六元五角、則每决之價値爲六分五釐、商業電話百五十决之通話費爲十元、則每决之價値亦爲六分三釐餘、此項價格之確定、本無根據、此種</p>
<p>巧取豪奪之技倆、又安能折服人心、誠爲電話用戶不能不反抗者也、以本會管見、電話之按决收費、或亦可行、惟旣定逾限以外、每次收費三分、則其限內之收費、有何理由、必須按决六分餘釐、苟其基本之價格爲六元五角或十元、則住宅電話之限度應爲二百次以上、商業電之限度應爲三百决以上、倘欲以一百與一百五十次爲基本數量、則其價格應爲三元與四元五角、吾則不得謂爲公允、况依據該公司與電話用戶所訂合同第三條第三項之規定、「將來電話價目之增减、可隨時請求工部局核准施行」、細譯文義、雙方固皆有請求之權、而不能聽由單獨之主張也、爲此函達、至祈貴局對該公司之請求、予以駁復、則醞釀中之對抗事件、當可消滅於無形、是爲至荷、此致法租界公董局」、</p>

<p>受害者為華人楊錫卿與俄人伊卜德　交該行保管之欵均擅改為通知存欵　——葛雷福被控侵佔詐欺背信——</p>
<p>美豐銀行於上年五月廿四日停業豐與該銀行有關係之美東銀公司·普益信托公司·普益地產公司、均因同受影響、相率倒閉、旋經美國駐滬按察使署派員淸理之下、發覺該銀行董事長美國人雷文、與重要職員白郞、有職務侵佔豐詐財·背信·行爲、遂由該淸理員向美按署對雷文·白郞·提起控訴、近經判决處雷文徒刑五年、白郞處徒刑兩年、雷文獲罪後、是吾廿服、聞刻尚在考慮白郞則已自認</p>
<p>咎有應得</p>
<p>業經表示捨棄上訴、願入居囹圄、嘗試鐵　風昧矣、惟經淸理員所查出者、除雷文白郞兩人之舞弊證據外、尙有做金子生意之蘇州楊錫卿、曾於去年四月八日、以現金兩萬元、交由該銀行保管、迨倒閉之後、竟發現已被易作通知存欵、致楊迄今未能索回趙璧、而與楊遭同等損失者、則為有人伊卜德氏、伊氏於去年四月三十日、亦以一萬二千元、　該行保管、亦被易為</p>
<p>通知存欵</p>
<p>美按署以楊·伊·兩人、旣非該署所能管轄、而被指爲應負此兩事責任之美豐副董事長兼任美豐總經理之葛雷福氏、向隷德籍、乃函知公共租界捕依法偵查、茲由該局法律部汝葆彝律師、向第一特區地方法院對葛雷福提起侵佔詐欺背信之公訴、昨日下午、由錢鴻業庭畏開庭傳審、被告特偕辯護律師陳霆銳及一外籍者投案、當由陳律師聲明、葛雷福現</p>
<p>患心臟病</p>
<p>今特扶疾到庭、在未向彼審問之前、請暫賜坐、庭上准之、於是汝葆彝律師乃起述起訴意旨、略謂、被告葛雷福、以副董事長兼任總經理、爲美豐銀行之負完全責任者、其副經理則係近已被判徒刑五年之雷文之姪、厥名亦曰雷文、本案之第一受害人楊錫卿、原與該銀行買辦王一遂友善、去年四月八日、楊携鈔幣二萬元赴美豐訪王、託其將</p>
<p>鈔幣兌現</p>
<p>而以該項現欵交與美豐保管、王即向被告請示、被告乃命王轉致楊作為「通知存欵」、此類存欵之性質、到期之前、先須通知、及期支付、但楊聞王轉述被告之意、殊不爲然、王因複與被告磋商、結果、由王遵被告意旨、接受楊欵、謂照保管手續辦理、當與楊一二萬元之保管收據、並着楊簽字及留印鑑於該行、俾將來支取時核對、收據內有保管庫主任朱友松·副經理雷文·簽字、實則此　萬元</p>
<p>並未存庫</p>
<p>保管、而朱與雷文之各於收據上簽字者、實遵被告之命耳、該行之保管賬簿內、雖有楊某兩萬元保管之記載、但其旁則詫有此係通知存欵字樣、更爲彌補手續欠缺計、除已給楊之保管收據外、另立一」通知存欵」之收據、藏諸保管庫、以資符合、足見此非偶然錯誤、當爲一種有計劃之行爲、故初後無人知、及該行倒閉、楊向淸理員霍夫請交還該欵、而啟庫則</p>
<p>空無所有</p>
<p>僅存此「通知存欵」之收據、事乃敗露、第一被害人依卜德、現已離滬、其所捐害一萬二千元、而受害之經過情形、與楊大致相同、所異者依氏原有欵存於美豐、去年叫月三十日、彼命該行提出一部份存欵、而改爲保管、故其所執亦爲保管收據也云云、庭上遂向楊錫卿訊問經過事實、楊即詳述顚末、並聲明彼始終係與王一遂接洽、並未與被告直接會談、繼傳見證王一遂、訊據供稱、楊以</p>
<p>兩萬鈔幣</p>
<p>託兌現金、並交美豐保管、當時我向被告請求、被告曾詢我楊欲如此週轉、其意何居、我乃對被告謂、楊慮日後鈔幣或不能兌現、故有此舉、被告乃着我令楊改作通知存欵、但楊不願、被告遂命我接受楊欵、而給以保管收據、該項鈔票、則由我當日送存中國銀行、收入美豐戶、迨美豐倒閉後、方知庫內所存者、僅一通知存欵之收據、我充該行買辦、因所訂</p>
<p>契約關係</p>
<p>對被告應絕對服從等語、次據保管庫主任朱友松供、所有楊與依卜德兩人之保管欵項、改易爲通知存欵之一切手續、皆係梁被告之命辦理、庭上嗣乃質之被告葛雷福供稱、凡有以現欵交銀行保管者、銀行當然不得將該欵移動、蓋保管之性質、與存儲之性質不同、楊錫卿以欵交美豐保管、而听給與者亦爲保管牧據、其後如何變爲</p>
<p>存欵收據</p>
<p>殊不明瞭、且此爲朱友松之責任、我平素着重於外滙事項、普通事務、頗少過問、頃王。朱·兩人所供、哦以不諳華語、故不知其所云、庭上即將王朱所述大意約略吿之、被告之續稱、倘由我命彼等如此辦理、則必有書面爲憑云云、陳律師即稱、本案內容、異常複雜、决非片言所能明晰、被告擬具辯訴、並請求補傅人證、以期水落石出、是以請予延期、錢庭長遂諭被告交二萬元保、改期星期四下午再訊、</p>

<p>— 中國微信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之十三）</p>
<p>吾國桐油向以漢口爲集散市場，上海僅居次要地位，歷來貨品之來源，行市之上落，悉恃漢口爲挹注。考桐油出口始於遜淸光緒二年，而上海有洋莊交易不過近十年事。歐戰以後，桐油在國內之銷路，逐漸衰落，而對外輸出反年有增加，在國際貿易上列於重要地位。以歷年輸出數量言，推民國二十二年出口之七五四·〇八一公擔爲最多，以價値倫，推民國十九年出口之叫五·八二〇·三〇八元爲最夥。惟上海實際桐油成交量年僅六七萬擔，占出口總額百分之六，故其地位並不十分重要。但自浙江西桐積極培養，大量在滬行銷以來，形勢稍變，上海已漸離漢口而趨於獨立矣。今先將桐油之種類及來源介紹於次。</p>
<p>桐油之種類及來源</p>
<p>桐油榨自桐籽，桐籽則產於桐樹。此種桐樹名爲油桐，亦稱荏桐，乃一種落葉亞喬木。桐樹有千年桐三年桐之別，前者果期極長，結實甚稀，收獲可數十年之久；後者適得其反，在第四五六年間，結實極盛，第七年以後，即漸衰落。桐籽乃桐樹所結果實之仁，大約每百斤可榨取桐油四五十斤，稱爲白桐油。我國現今十九仍採用土法榨油，不惟油質易濁，油量損失亦甚綦重。桐油以產區論，可分川桐，南桐，襄古桐，邊江桐，荆沙桐，徽桐，浙桐等類。白桐油入鍋煎熬，煉成深色，即稱洪桐油；如加入別種油脂，其質粘韌，即稱秀油。故桐油按其實質而言，又有白，洪，秀三種之別，實際僅生熟之別耳。惟桐油裝置，互有不同，有以桶裝，有以簍裝，同時每種桐油油質，亦有高低，因而白油中有分京方，桶白，支籌，足度油，簍度等名目，洪油中有分正，副牌，秀油中有分尖，中，尾者。此外白，洪，秀又分下列若干牌號：</p>
<p>一，白油—春源，亦昌，衡昌，德昌，德昶，茂昌，其昌，裕昌，餘昌。</p>
<p>二，洪油—徐榮昌，慶元豐，楊恒源，吉盈豐，濟昌和，恒昌永，祥泰豐，集豐盈，蕭恒慶，楊恒昌，大昌豐。</p>
<p>三，秀油—萬興裕，大有恒，集豐恒，集泰恒，大有豐。</p>
<p>此種繁複之區別，從事經營桐油業者，實有諳識之必要。至桐油之來源，則通於湘·鄂·川·陝·粵·桂·浙·徽諸省，每年產量，不下一百五十萬担。各省桐油之運銷，湘鄂陝川大抵薈集萬縣重慶，經由漢口出口；廣東廣西以香港爲中心；安徽浙江以上海爲中心。在昔上海桐油之來源，除洪秀油由產區經漢口轉滬外，白油亦恃漢口爲挹注。民國十二年，盧氏創辦東方油公司，經營洋莊交易，開始採辦浙江油，當以運輸便捷，利潤優厚，同業相繼效尤，於是漢桐在滬之銷路，竟被浙桐侵奪，甚至目下上海行銷之漢白油泰半亦以浙油灌裝假冒。故目下上海之桐油業，漸已能離漢口而獨立。</p>
<p>桐油之銷路及運輸</p>
<p>桐油銷路，在民十以前，國內外之數量相埒，人後遂背道而馳。蓋國外用途日漸推廣，除一般工業用外，在軍用品中亦佔重要地位，如飛機潛水艇之外層，皆需桐油塗飾保護，反之，國內用途，因僅限於潤澤房屋器具，毫無發展，故推至今日，內銷數量紙及生產總額百分之十六，同時行銷之貨，十九叉爲外銷不及格之桐油。茲將國外國內之銷路縷述如下：</p>
<p>一，外銷—我國桐油，輸往美國最多，恒占總出口額十分之七，其餘則售與英，荷，丹，德，法，比，意等國。近年來美國雖自行培種桐樹，圖謀抵制華油，但成效尙鮮。故今日中國桐油之出口，在世界市場上尚能保持獨占之地位，試觀下表，尤為明顯：</p>
<p>中國歷年輸出桐油統計表</p>
<p>在華採辦桐油之洋行，大都設莊於漢口，萬縣，岳州，常德等地，本埠則有好時，合義，安利，嘉利，禮和，紹和，捷成，小林，三義等洋行，但爲兼營性質。（未完）</p>

<p>斐先生放下了羅勃，然後立起身來，用手臂去圍着他高的姪兒的肩膀，面上顯出一種眞切的欣愉，說道：</p>
<p>「這件事能帮助我渡過這苦難，使得我對你們大家有一種信任，鎭上還需要着我去料理，所以我須得離開你們若干小時。我本想放你們一天假，或者把你們幾個人送回家裏，但是假如你們喜歡留住，仍舊像剛才這麽進行着，那末我想到我的孩子們，我必是很喜歡而且得意的」。</p>
<p>「我們寗可這般」，「我們要留住」，「拂朗會照顧我們的」；幾個人喊着，他們見到已經能够得到斐先生的信任，心裏是很快樂的。</p>
<p>「媽爾媽爾不回來嗎」？羅勃問道，顯出了切望的神情；因為家裏沒有了「媽爾媽爾」，從他看來，直是沒有天日的世界了。</p>
<p>「我們兩人今晚回來；不過現在好姨媽梅格需要她比你需要她更毀切，我知道你願把她出借一下的」。</p>
<p>「嘸，我願意的；不過坦第一直哭着要她，他竟打納綏，壞極吵極」，羅勃答道，彷彿那個消息是可以催促母親歸家的。</p>
<p>斐先生問道，「我的小男兒在那裏」？</p>
<p>「唐恩領他出去，好敎他安靜些。他現在已沒什麽了」，拂朗說着一手指點着窗門，從這裏他們可以看見唐恩拖着小寳寳在他的小車子裏，四面有幾隻狗在嬉戲跳躍。</p>

<p>— 趙棣華</p>
<p>歐戰以後，各國經濟，均蒙重大損失，爲恢復戰前繁榮，及救濟大規模失業計，乃不得不於政治外交敵對陣容以外，在經濟上力謀國外市場之開拓，以求增加國際貿易；同時爲抵禦他國產品傾銷，保護本國產業起見，又高築關稅壁壘，此種經濟戰爭，彼此循環報復，時日旣久，益趨嚴重，經濟恐慌，激盪全球。我國在世界潮流之中，自難例外，外受各國變更貨幣政策傾銷市場之壓迫，內受天災兵禍生產沒落之影響，遂致工商疲敝，百業凋零，貿易入超，年有增加，形成垂危之局面。</p>
<p>在工商業極度衰危之下金融事業則尙有長足進步、觀於民國二十年至二十三年、此四年中，銀行之添設，幾若雨後春筍，不絕產生，存欵與發行額之逐年增加，以及庫存盈餘等項之步增，種種現象，固無一非表示中國銀行事業之邁步前進，惟吾人苟於金融業加以較詳之剖析，則感所謂繁榮局面，爲畸形，爲矛盾矣。一國資金，有如血絡，必須脈脈相通，乃能盡其作用，但我國資金，因內地在輸入品傾銷之下，收支失其平衡，而地主富人又莫不以都市為　藏淵藪、故近年以來，國內資金，日向都市集中，而資金集中，停滯壅積之結果，又形成金融資金膨脹，與產業資金枯竭之矛盾現象。金融業旣感資金之積滯，死藏庫中，工商放欵，又因百業衰落，深感不易收回，乃經營優利之投機事菜一朝金融緊迫，立見恐慌，擠提風潮，此起彼落，一般資力薄弱投資不穩之行莊，原有資金，旣已凍結，益以存底空虛，無法應付，最後惟有紛紛倒閉，宣吿淸理之一途，更形成近年來之金融恐慌。</p>
<p>在目前狀况之下，工商業固應力謀本身組織之健全，以深思遠慮之眼光，奠立百年基礎，而金融業亦應更求進展協助生產業之改良，以謀國民經濟之發展。爰就管見所及約略述之</p>
<p>（一）恊助增加生產减低入超</p>
<p>論者多以吾國貿易入超，為國民經濟衰落之象徵，足以充分表現吾國歷年來工商業之落後，且謂吾國苟欲挽救經濟恐慌，非調整貿易上之入超不可。吾國確爲世界最重要之入超國家、而入超情形，又屬純粹逆態，非如英日等國入超之有大宗無形收入以資抵補者可比。自一八六四年以來，七十年間，除其中六年爲出超外，其餘均為入超，而入超之數字，又與年俱增，最多如民國二十一年，達五萬五千六百零六萬關兩，二十二二十三年，雖略有减少，亦在四五萬萬元之問。而此兩年入超收字之减低，一由於東北海關貿易收字之未能計入，貿易本身，數字低落，一由於國內經濟枯涸，購買力薄弱，洋貨未能暢銷，形成入口貿易收字低落於出口之現象，而非由於出口貿易之發展，或由於國內工業生產之進步，足以替代洋貨之銷場，固無以謂强差人意者在。且入超之比率，已等於入口總額百分之五十以上，其情形之嚴重，又可想而知。至於數十年長期入超及入超總數之巨又為各國所未有。故入超問題，實為吾國目前經濟之重大難關，固無可諱言者也。　（未完）</p>

<p>— （兪友淸）</p>
<p>世界上一切都是假，所以佛典上說：色卽是空，空卽是色。」這兩句話，多麼透澈呀！</p>
<p>本來我們在世上，熙來攘往，那一個不是假？奔走權貴之門，爭逐名利之途，試問那一個不是假？等到閣王要你命的時候，依舊一雙空手，這不是數十年的忙忙碌碌，結果依舊是空，依舊是假嗎？</p>
<p>套上了假面具，任何人看不出你是堯舜，是盜　，一旦揭破了，方才知道你完全是假，這是做人最後一步的結果。</p>
<p>白相人的口吻，你「假來」，或者說「你不要假來西」，好像是句棒喝語，使聽的人，多少有些驚悚。因爲自己的弱點，好像被人已看出了，以後不可以在入面前說假語，做假事，擺假架子了。</p>
<p>有許多人常常在那裏嚷着說：情海是苦海，情塲是戰塲，情關是難關，我們不要爲情顚倒，爲情犧牲，總要打破一切，不入漩渦中，方才是個好男兒。但是，但是，他說雖然這樣說，可惜已做了情塲中的俘虜。這不是看得破，跳不過嗎？結果言行不符，又入於假之一途了。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>每天飯後，該幹些甚麼事情？這是極堪研究的。</p>
<p>美國加里福尼亞的一位醫學博士漢密而敦說，飯後最好的消遣，是散步，打哥而夫球，或是玩東方式的拳擊。（按卽我們的國術。）總之，飯後不可不運動，但也不可作劇烈的運動，爲的是飯後不運動，易害不消化病，飯後作劇烈運動，本已運行極速的血液，有使血管爆裂的危險。這一個理論，自然是可以代表一般的說法，而且也是我們平常所最熟知的。</p>
<p>但是德國有一位醫學博士高夫門的說法，却又不同。他正在極方提倡飯後小睡半小時。他說進膳之後，因血液的循環加速着，腦神經往往生疲乏的反映。這時候，不拘是作任何輕微的運動，雖然可於一方面减少疲乏，但同時，腦神經却又不能不因未曾把一切思慮，完全靜止下去，而相當的增加疲乏。所以飯後雖經相當的遊戲，下午的工作，總不能如上午工作的有精神，這便是一個明證。若要解决這問題，惟有於飯後一刻鐘後，小睡半小時，使全身得到絕對的息，那麽身心獲益、而於下午工作時，以精神煥發。</p>
<p>這二大宗派，互相對峙着。究竟我們該何所適從，自然在目前，還無從說起，因爲據我在辦公處默察所得，飯後把脚伸在辦公桌上小睡的也有，結伴出外散步的也有，可是雙方却一樣的頑健。有些不午睡，也不散步，而只是團聚着說說笑話，談談女人的，也是很好。至於女太太們，每天飯後打上八圈牌，倒也無所謂。不知這在外國的醫學博士瞧來，又將作何感想？</p>

<p>五彩電燈密圍着橫匾招牌的四周；匾下「中學爲體，西學爲用」的收音機，連綿不絕地播送出俚曲鄉音。</p>
<p>寬敞的店堂，除一部分給櫃檯圍作冷淸淸的辦公處外，其餘大半給就地陳列的貨物佔據着。貨物的中央，强烈燈光的照射下，斜支着一塊面糊紅紙的木牌。疏疏落落的字，先說明該號剏辦有年，信用素孚，……最後：「諸位如能猜破下列秘密，方知言之不謬：</p>

<p>不過有一天，我看見那被禁停車的區城裏却滿停着七八輛以上的汽車，我眞疑心我的眼睛看錯了，再在汽車底下細看，究竟還是「不准停車」四個大字。巡捕先生在「不准小便，如違送捕」的招貼底下小便是司空見慣的事，而這一决的情形也正相仿，靠馬路是一家外國人開的西菜館，汽車裏走出來的也都是外國貴族婦女以及高尙的紳士們，門口站立着的也正是西捕，看裝束，甚至是捕　呢。但是他却在照管着停在不准停車上面的汽車，以及汽車裏走出來的「琴脫而孟，」嗚呼，所謂止流人，知法犯法，古今中外原是一例的。</p>
<p>前幾年會聽到王雲五先生講：美國禁酒時期，小畢三偷偷地拿了酒瓶走，便要被罰，紳士們大模大樣挾了酒瓶走，警察便屁也不敢放一僩。天下事蓋大率類此！</p>

<h3 id="c199">日本的鄕土工藝 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在我國的市塲中，充塞了日本的工藝品。除了日用品之外，要算小工藝品最多了。三個銅元的洋泡泡，幾分錢一個的洋囝囝，這種本輕利重的東西，很能使日本的輕工業，發達到繁榮的地位。我國每年有好幾千的留學生到日本去硏究考察，大都是到舉校裏去讀書實騐。到工廠裏鄕鎭裏去硏究他們的小工藝是百不得一的。如有人能不辭勞苦，去實地研究。將來回國，很可使我的小工藝作一度的改進。但是留日學生費了許多金錢，總想得着學位回來，昇官發財，那個肯去頂石臼做戲呢。</p>
<p>不要看不起鄕土工藝是毫無重要性的，要知道鄕土工藝是一地方的民間副業。若能改良發達，很能安定該地的經濟地位的。我國山東的草帽，如能改進，未嘗不可和巴拿馬相頡頏。無錫阿福，如能改變作風，也可和日本洋囝囝並駕齊驅的啊。况吾國土地廣大，物產豐富，那一件不可作爲工藝品的原料。有智識的人，都看輕小工藝，不屑硏究。於是任着無智識的人，墨守舊法，那有不淘汰之理。江北人糖担上的老雄雞和大加官，恐怕百年之後，仍舊如此的。</p>
<p>（說明）相傳立春正辰，地氣轉運，鷄卵可直立平地。本月五日辰時三刻，適値立春，章君正範夫婦，邀請在曼雲，徐蘇靈，黃敬齋，張天疇，周寒梅，及余等八人，實地試騐騐早餐畢，携鷄鴨卵十二枚，同至台拉新邨花園中，候至辰時三刻正，各以卵試，果然應騐，在君並爲攝影如右圖。當時引爲奇談，越半小時試之，則隨放隨倒，可見傳說並非虛語。特誌之願科學家作學理上之解釋，惠寄本刋，當再爲披露也，（寄萍）</p>
<p>誰都知道日本工業發達，但是除了大工廠有大烟囱，大工塲以外，普通多用電機的小廠家。工人只有十幾個，房子不到十間。我國工塲神氣活現，外面掛着「工廠重地，閑人莫入」的虎頭牌，其實是空架子，廠基生財早已押出在外了。工廠築建經濟，多置機械，則旣省資本又節工金，是日本小工業的基本原萴。不論任何工廠，都請好了有學識的專門人村，在設計打樣。於是各人鈎心鬥角，別出心裁的互相競爭着。所以他們的出品層出不窮，能跟着時代進行的。一方面歐美有了新出品，便研究仿造，結果常能較歐美的精良而價廉。</p>
<p>沿海的地方，出產貝殼，附近人家便拾了美麗的，製成玩具。兩片貝殼合起來便成了鳥類的肚皮，螺絲殼的頭，可以做成各種不同的鳥類。蚌殼彫成的飾物，潔白光澤和我國的象牙彫刻相同。我國家庭化學工業社的蛤蜊蜜，便是利用自然。日本在大蛤蜊中貯藏食物玩具，也是相同的。泥人摩登得和現實一樣，泥人的身上都穿着美麗的綢衣服，已從小孩的玩具而爲成人的欣賞品了。他們能倣造各國男女，凡是優伶明星都是他們的模特兒。先山藝術家照着照片彫着模型，然後漸漸翻板出來。各人的衣服姿勢，都是由雜誌照片作藍本的。所以放在橱窗裏，有十足的誘人力，誰走過了，都想站足欣賞一下，價格最高的達百元以上。</p>
<p>賽瑯珞的玩具和鐵製木製的電車汽車，種類不知有多少，最近賽璐珞的洋囝囝身上也穿了薄紗衣服了，增加美麗不少。此外身體中聞裝着發條，可以行走游泳。此種小工藝在學校裏反而學不到的，只有到各地去收集購買，才能研究改良。我國小工廠如若要和日本貨競爭的話，先要託人去收集，然後倣造改良，是事半功倍的。</p>
<p>日本各地，可以說沒有一處沒有土產，其鄉土工藝之發達，於此可見。北海道產木材，便以各種樹皮樹枝，做成文具用品，亦樸實可愛。某處產熊，於是人民以木塊彫熊，成爲裝飾。其他像竹工漆工麥柴工，都十分有趣。因爲花紋式樣，力求新穎美麗，很能吸引顧客的。假定一隻香烟盒，磁的，洋鐵的，木製，竹製，玻璃，陶器，貝殼等都有。電燈的燈罩除玻璃洋鐵以外，有綢絹的，印花紙的，賽璐珞的，竹框的數種。他們的工藝品顏色美麗而調和，樣式合時。都是現時代的用具，絕對不會拘泥舊法。最近意大利和阿比西尼亞作戰，日人十分注意，他們便利用這一點，已經製造了許多黑人軍隊出售了。</p>

<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>治療淋病的藥物，治療淋病的器械，到了現代，可算得琳琅滿目了，但分析牠的療法起來，不外四種，那裏這四呢呢？就是（一）內服法，當擇具有強大之滲透力及消炎殺菌之優良製劑，如德商美　洋行發售之「滅殺淋」，可說於此數點，美備無遺了。（二）局部療法，通常每用蛋白銀等製做局部洗射的藥料，使用此種藥療法的時候，若使用時間的久暫和藥液的濃度不適當，則可謂毫無功效，自德國滿爾志大藥廠之淋病局部療藥「淋毒舒樂耳」發明以來，醫藥各界，遂多改用，因其乃淋病血淸與舒樂耳之混合劑，有免疫愈淋之効。（三）注射法，色素及混合淋苗之注射，色素之佳製劑如天德藥廠之脫呂怕弗拉文，混合淋苗之優秀者如德商高福洋行之「滿爾志白濁混合苗」，此二者一以藥力殺菌，一以自動免疫，交互使用，可謂妥善。（四）電械療法，根據熱力殺菌，所謂透熱殺菌者，則短波透熱電機爲最有價值，有運用富爾國紫光電及長波熱電機　，要皆難收相當之效，甚或因此而反使愈期延長，更毋庸說其灼傷肌膚等等之流弊矣，此外在尿道淋時，即病症完全在尿道的意思，用水銀石英燈之冷光照射，所謂光度滅菌是，亦有相當之效。</p>

<p>— 醫師佘雷</p>
<p>任何人染有鴉片後，必須逐日予以相當鴉片量之消費，否則立呈禁斷現象（俗謂脫　），謹略述數種如下（一）分泌亢進，淚腺，唾腺及上氣道之粘液腺等之分泌皆陡增，其最顯著者如流淚，（二）胃腸障碍，如噯氣嘔吐下痢等，（三）生殖器部亦有顯著變調，如女子之月經過多，男子之遺精及性慾勃發等，（四）失眠，此種失眠非催眠藥所克奏效，（五）循環系統之變調，其脈轉細弱而頻數，其劇甚者則陷於虛脫，或因心臓麻痺而死，（六）他如欠伸噴嚏，四肢酸楚等等。其所以有此等現象者，此乃鴉片侵害人體明證之結果，舉凡鴉片慢性中毒者，胥有期現象，鴉片侵害之狀況，可分精神的與肉體的二種，精神的殊無憑說，姑略不述，至於肉體方面，由他覺的可以證明者，（一）皮下脂肪缺乏，皮膚驰縊，吸煙者什九爲全身　瘦，高度中毒者，則更甚。（二）分泌都受障碍，唾液腺及皮脂肪之分泌皆減少，此由皮膚乾燥可以卜如，消化腺之分泌亦障碍，此由食慾不振消化不良大便不整上可以卜知，（三）生殖機能亦衰弱，如男子之陰萎女子之月經閉止，（四）循環系統之變化亦顯著，脈博徐緩而不整。上述諸症狀，若能設法減絕其鴉片毒素之來源，則不難消失而復其本來之健態焉。</p>

<p>胃痛一證，恒非單獨而來，必兼雜有吞酸，噯氣，嘔吐諸症狀同時普來，考此等症狀之原因，率爲急性胃炎，慢性胃炎及胃酸過多症等之發作時之應有現象，所以處置此等疾患時，於藥物方面說起來，惟有亞爾加里劑，如胃痛急劇，則同時加以強有力之止痛劑，靡不　然而愈。</p>

<p>亞爾加里製劑，任誰都知道是胃病良劑，特別在胃酸過多症之胃痛爲更有特效，他如嘔吐，吞酸等等，亦得服此而頓覺輕快。此種製劑，多若過江之鯽，不勝屈指，我於擇用之餘，惟喜「胃寳」，是藥旣爲憂越之亞爾加里製劑，復具不含麻醉之強力止痛劑，是以用之以治胃痛，瞬間立可應效，誠奇藥也。</p>

<p>— 孫志耀</p>
<p>遺精與早洩，均爲性神經衰弱症之一部分的現象，患此症之大部分原因，大多爲房事過度與手淫而起，人體精液，最爲寶貴，其來源由於睪丸製造供，因副睪丸之任用，於輸精營輸入精囊壁，一部流入淋巴管至血管，循環於血液中，作爲營養，一部由動脈仍歸睪丸，再成精液，成精液循環，遺精過多，及手淫房事過度，均能使精液過甚消耗，生理上產生之新血液，不足補充，於是早洩遺精，於至神經系統咸蒙影響，釀成神經衰弱症，不但此也，他如腦病心贓病等必相繼襲來，故遺精，早洩等症，絕對不可忽視，有影響生命之危險。本症之治療方法，可說藥物與精神並重，如正思慮，絕慾念，避免身心過勞，嚴守攝生，選擇營養，藥物的使用，如有機性燐及內分泌等均稱合理，此等混合製劑之「安爾神」，頗爲醫藥界所推獎，電氣療法，感染電氣及攝護腺按摩等亦俱有效。</p>

<p>— 泰</p>
<p>憂國自殺，天然是一件值得慷慨悲歌的事，從自殺的本身說來，自殺是何等嚴重而可悲的事情，因爲憂國而甘於犧牲一己，是何等可歌可泣的壯舉，此種事情，似乎可以值得崇拜和敬慕的，然而我以爲不，決不。</p>
<p>爲什麼呢？中國的事情，名目十分好聽，而事實並不如此者，往往很多，非但監委杜養之憂國自殺，可以不必說，卽如轟轟烈烈破腹祭陵之續範亭，也並不能說他是一位好漢，因爲自殺是消極的，是無聊的，卽使自殺，而對於憂並不能說他是一位好漢，因爲自殺是消極的，是無聊的，卽使自殺，而對於憂國之目的，完全不能貫徹，眞所謂憂也白憂，殺也白殺。</p>
<p>自殺者旣抱有這樣的精神，與這樣的勇氣，則天下事大有可爲，一樣要死，落得做些轟轟烈烈的事而死，旣可以有益國家，又可以留名千古，又可以刺激國人耳目。這何等有價值呢？古人云：「死或重於泰山，或輕於鴻毛，」卽在此處。</p>
<p>人特患怕死，若一怕死就無辦法，歷史上的英雄好漢，名將豪傑，那一個不是從不怕死上得來的頭銜，故不怕死原是最好的事，但是不怕有不怕的道理，死有死的代價，方才不枉一死。</p>
<p>所以我對於憂國而自殺的一般人，雖是同所着一種哀矜的熱情，但決不能認爲是有志氣有能爲的志士。</p>
<h3 id="c208">舊的流浪曲 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>在新華番攤館——它的美名是新華俱樂部，幹了還不到三個月的事便又完了。起初，滿以爲從今後就可以好好地過一些日子，但，這美麗的春花樣的希望，終於像把石子投在遼漠的大海里似的，一點聲息也沒有地沉落到海底去。</p>
<p>那一晚，在五區警察分局的拘留所里，有我們的十二三個夥計，和四十來個賭客。大家互相地楞住了眼珠子，你瞧瞧我，我瞧瞧你，眞沒趣，又不能稍爲談一點話，後來就大家倚靠着背脊，打着瞌睡。這樣地度過了一夜，又繼續到第二天下午，我們纔給釋放出來。所得到的判決，是罰了一大筆的錢，這是由我們的老闆擔承出錢的。</p>
<p>我決意不再幹這遭玩意兒了。就東蕩西蕩地浪費了一大串的日子。那些日子里邊，曾經加入過他們的集團——黑鬼子陳，高佬李，和亞基所組織的——合夥兒去沿街兜售「百草萬靈油」。</p>
<p>因爲，我是後來纔去加入他們的集團，而且，所繳出的股本，也不過是三塊老洋。他們，其實都是黑鬼陳的主張，只敎我去拿那寫著「劉伯輝百草萬靈油」八個碗口大的白字的旗子，和携帶藥箱。</p>
<p>每天，每天，打街頭溜到街尾，脚給跑酸了，嘴給喊乾了，纔喫得那兩頓白飯。雖然那是多麼有趣的勾當，瞎七八拉地把幾種藥品配合起來，就說是百草煉製，能治療萬種病症的。那一百種草呢，眞是連自己也攪不淸了。——人有時是需要以假裝的東西去欺騙別一些人們的哪。</p>
<p>可是，時常在夜靜中，想起人家，望望自己，就會悲哀一件爲人力所不能挽回的不幸事情一樣的，拿懷疑世界上一切的眼光，凝視着那蒼茫的天空，詛咒着命運。那情形，正彷佛一羣歸巢的老鴉子飛掠過河面，投下了個黯黑的廣漠的陰影，這麼地，心就會沒來由的暗澹起來了。</p>
<p>不久，我的堂兄弟給我找到一個中學里的看門的職守，沒有戀惜地，我脫離了那三個夥伴。</p>
<p>「好好的命運是不會光臨我的。」</p>
<p>我每每不樂意時，就這麼的想。</p>
<p>眞的，短短的五個月，爲了我私下拿了一些學生的錢，而放他們出去玩耍的緣故，便給開除了。</p>
<p>多少是有些徬徨的呢。</p>
<p>東不成，西不就，日子一天一天地流過去，頂使我着急的，是那喫飯的問題。不喫又不行，爲了這，我曾經幹過許多不名譽的事情的。……漸漸地，日子眞有點不好過起來。在先，是窒息了似的艱度着。一天又一天挨過去，沙漠上的駱駝在灰色的旅途中底跋涉啊，艱苦得有時簡直是透不出氣來。像有一根繩子勒住頭　子，鬆驰的時候，是痛苦地喘息着，緊張的時候，就連……</p>
<p>（生活是個尊强凌弱的壞東西哪）！</p>
<p>（懂得么）？</p>
<p>许多親戚朋友們，生活底虔誠的膜拜者，瞧見你這窮光蛋的傢伙，便都會暗暗地在心裏說，</p>
<p>——給他瞧瞧白眼吧，這小子上門沒有好東西的。</p>
<p>接着，又指桑罵槐地嘮叨着，詛咒着。</p>
<p>就是肚皮餓癟了，這一頓飯也難於揩油啊。……</p>
<p>因爲納悶，也常常跑到珠江邊去蹓躂。憑了橍杆，可以看到珠江一張闊臉孔。江水像永遠感不到疲倦一般地流着。活潑起來，就低低地唱着爲人們所不知名的小曲子；沉默的時候，會使人感覺恐懼。那是一種患病的老人，以爲死亡的訊息將近來臨的恐懼。</p>
<p>遠遠地，海珠鐵橋擺着一個高貴而傲漫的紳士底架子。船隻載滿貨物，人們，穿梭着，不停地來回地穿棱着。有的是從遼遠的天邊，帶來了吸吮這神秘的老古國的血液的魔鬼；有些却從古舊的村落，鄉鎭，載着一批批的，出賣了祖先們的光榮的東西出去。</p>
<p>岸邊，高層的建築物佇立着。</p>
<p>江心那裏，要是逗留了一兩隻不知幹什麼用的軍艦，就有龐大的紫影，倒挿在水裏，而且，那影子也喜歡逗着水面上的漣漪開玩笑。</p>
<p>我愛把疲乏的眼珠子發楞般地準朝着那些東西上面。同時，又感到有個陰影在心坎裏，漸漸地，漸漸地，擴大開來。我擔憂這陰影會把我的纖弱的心侵蝕去了的一天。</p>
<p>這樣的流漡，並不是全然的壞事。在那些貨堆棧的門口走走，偶而的，找到了一點機會，得做個把臨時脚夫，也可以撈到足够喫一頓的代價的。</p>
<p>然而，鎭日價的徬徨在憂怨，空虛，和鬰悶所容合的情緒裏邊，人，幾乎是變做了幽靈一樣可怕地繼續着生活。</p>
<p>——疲倦了吧。</p>
<p>要是我還能感覺到愉快的話，那就是我已經脫離它—這魔鬼看守着的生活了。是哪，沒有人不能意識到的，每個囚犯都是翼望著脫離開牢獄的啊。……</p>
<p>這樣又繼續了八九個月。——</p>
<p>直至後來，當我接到我的舅父，在羊樓洞茶山來了一封，敎我立卽到他那裏去的信時，我就毅然地把這「人生旅程」劃了一個階段，而踏上另外的一個新的了。</p>
<h3 id="c209">糖菓 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>從朋友家里歸來，走過一家新開張的糖菓店，嫩綠色的油漆，被店堂里十數盞極度光亮的電燈照耀着，顯得十分調和，美感……我每天從這條路上回家，可是現在記不淸楚這門面從前是關閉着的，或是另外的一家什麼店舖。因爲是新開張，店堂內圍着繞以上的顧客，雜亂地在湧來湧去，在街心走過，我只看見伙計的頭顱在顧客的頭顱上搬來搬去。這時候我前面的一個走路人忽然在店門前站住了，於是我也停了脚步，自然後面還有人跟着停住了。說起來我自小不喜歡吃糖菓，現在有一時能够咬破胡桃的牙齒，母親說是就爲了不吃糖菓的關係。今天到朋友家里去，是商量一件和我前途有很大關係的事件，結果是失敗了，但是在歸家的路上，我沒有忘懷過這件事，我思量着或許我的話說得不够懇切，或者應該換一種旁敲側擊的方法去打動朋友的心，使他帮助我成全這件事。這樣想着時，我非常後悔，悽傷，雖然那樣做了是否能够成功，還是沒有把握的，不過這件事好像沒有做完似的，我幾乎想走回頭路再到朋友家里去。這樣獨自徘徊着設法解決的時候，我剛停住在糖菓店門前，看着前面的人踏進店里去，我像被他汲引着似的也踏進兩繞的人羣中了。我不是說從來不喜歡吃糖菓的嗎，我不明白自己踏進門來做甚？在店堂的中央，堆着一個很好看的塔，是用許多不同式樣的餅乾　堆砌成的，綴着五色的小電燈，可是那末多的人都喊着伙計要些什麼，並不注意到這所塔燈，我就像一個識貨朋友那樣賞覽着這藝術品。我不知道我那時的模樣是否像個扒手兒，一個有高硬的領口，和衣袖上捲着半截雪白襯衫的伙計跑到我跟前來了，他問我要買些什麼，這時候我眞沒有理由去回絕他了，因爲有許多顧客都圍到他跟前要他包紥一些我不大熟悉的糖菓名字，於是我回答他要買一點東西。他就一引引到我另外一個櫃台旁，指着玻璃櫃內各種美麗的盒子，盤子，這些都是我從來沒有注意到的食物，現在在這位伙計殷勤的招待之下，我胡亂指着這，那，請他包紥一點。可是當我想問他價錢的時候，他又里面抓出不少樣品來，什麼松子糖，椰子糖，一顆顆小的，一塊塊方的，我驚奇我今天學得了不少關於糖的學識，又請他多少各樣包一點，總計付了三塊多錢。提着那麼一大紥東西，我不能步行了，喚了輛人力車到家里。</p>
<p>婦在門口等我，我方始注意到弄口的街燈已亮了，因爲糖菓店里燃着太多的電燈，我忘了我在那里已經費去了不少時光。妻見我提着一大紥東西歸來，她一手接了過去，當她看清楚招牌紙上「天祿字號」四個字時候，她天眞地笑了，問我什麼高興買了那末多才多藝的糖菓，她好像意識到和朋友商議的那件事情獲得了意外的成功，喊着孩子的名字跑上樓去了。我付了車錢，慢慢地上樓，覺得自己彷彿做了一個夢，但是那一大紥糖菓明明在孩子手里一包一包地拆散，開來了，心里問着我爲什麼買那末多的糖菓呢？</p>

<p>梧桐葉落立秋天。黛玉是，觸景生悲百感牽。奴想，自己嬌容消瘦極。多愁多病或多眠。宛如夏季的花和卉。到了秋天色不妍。又想那，秋月凄凉如水潔。令人一見動心絃。比那，廣寒宮內的嫦娥女。不及她，能逃出情關了俗緣。遇着那，秋雨連宵天不霽。芳心抑鬱恨難塡。怨那，雨師不顧秋花損。日夜綿綿濕鳳仙。更有秋風金鐵似。摧殘秋木有誰憐。宛如執法的秋官似。狂殺那，無罪佳人心太偏。見那，秋雁孤飛高又遠。鳴聲悲切在天邊。只因聽得弓弦響。所以，飛入雲中免性命捐。叉見那，秋燕紛紛歸去急。呢喃話別不流連。復聽那，秋蟲唧唧鳴聲衆。如秋雨瀟瀟徧大千。更見那，秋露如珠容易滅。和水中泡影一般然。想人生1世亦似朝露。轉眼成空如暮烟。奴覩物傷懷心痛切。忍不住，眼垂玉箸淚雙懸。賽過春天泣杜鵑。</p>

<p>「化身姑娘」是黃嘉謨所編劇，是一部可歌可泣的倫理人情劇，劇中有纏綿曲折的故事，有唯美戀愛的笑劇，更有奧奇神秘的趣味，至於全劇則完全採取美化的手法來發展劇情，在每一個鏡頭裏或者每一段戲劇裏，我們可看出導演人的苦心，和愼重的從事。所以、「化身姑娘一有卓越的成績是可預料的。</p>

<p>— 旦</p>
<p>一九三六年的新別克汽車。精美絕倫。凡是見過的和坐過的人。無不同聲讚美。</p>
<p>原來其所以得享盛名。初非倖致。因其新式之無聲直列八汽缸頭上汽門或引擎。加以特有之「安諾來脫」活塞。有非比尋常的功能。又其原力之强。開駛之便。亦顯而易見。至其有裨經濟更能迅速證明。他如「足尖一踏」式之眞空制車系。費斯出品「鐵甲」化車頂之車身。地位之放大與舒適之增進。以及各項機系之精到。內外部份之美觀。亦皆昭著異常。上面的種種特點。對於乘坐的大衆。都是很有深切的關係。下文再言其要略。</p>
<p>俗語說的好。百聞不如一見。讀者各位。要曉得別克汽車的好處。最好實地乘坐別克。由別克自己來表演給諸位身親而目觀。但是。現在雖是紙上談兵。亦宋嘗不可照此途徑。說一個大要。</p>
<p>我們先來看一看別克汽車的全部。計分四組。十四個式子。到處適用。各界咸宜。</p>
<p>第九十組「麗美」式　此項別克汽車。大而矮。寬敞無比。闊度超過高度。製造的時侯。放棄一切從前尺碼。另闊蹊徑。不遺餘力。使其式樣和華美。在汽車界佔先一年。</p>
<p>第八十組「路主」式外表華美。馬力高超。稱爲雙絕。無論在何時何地。無不行駛如意。絕無顚簸振盪之虞。以「路主」名。眞是名副共實。</p>
<p>第六十組「世紀」式　此種別克汽車。馬力和速率。高出尋常。惟有與旋風比儗。庶幾近之。社會上翹足引領以待此種汽車之出現。奚啻千萬人。而今不付高價。能得一輛汽車。馬力速率堪稱無匹。而同時其式樣之精。外表之美。品質之佳。又不稍遜。可謂如願以償矣。</p>
<p>第四十組特號　有許多汽車乘客。往往寤寐思求購用別克汽車。但因價格關係。未能如願。還有許多人。一旦買了別克汽車。因環境關係。近年來捉襟見肘。以致無力保有。現在他們的幻夢可成事實了。因爲特號別克。價格極低。卽腰繼並不若何富有。亦能致之。而且其品質仍與價高的汽車完全一樣。舉凡別克所有的特點。特號別克無不盡有之。而此種特點。又爲世界上其他汽車所無。</p>
<p>上面就是別克新汽車的四組。那各汽車的流綫。從新式的狹窄的水箱柵直到後面的保險槓。綿延一錢。絕不間斷。其馬力。其速度。又爲從來所未見。在公館門前。停了這樣一輛汽車。眞是何等威風。</p>
<p>再來看看車頂。與車身密合。若天衣無縫。這就是費斯公司「鐵甲」化式車頂。侮用整個無縫冷　純綱製成。又其機罩上的克羅米。閃閃發光。這也是別克汽車的特色。共他如克羅米水箱飾品。强固之輻輪。寬大之脚踏板。與車身一體之行李箱等等。都是特長之點。各車所有一切。均足悅目動人。</p>
<p>至別克汽車內部。駕駛部份非常寬太。斜座較前深而闊。頂上地位。極爲寬餘。這裏就可見到另一種的更改。就是那制動桿。已經從尋常的地方移到了隔板之下。在駕駛人之左面。那個地方正是最易及到的所在。脚旁的地位因此非常寬餘了。</p>
<p>克羅米的錶板。也是可愛的東西。速度表及其他各錶上的數字，就是在開行極快的時候。也能一望而知。該項錶板又能直接或間接放光。以便夜間開行。隔板上的小紅燈使你知道車頭的燈光究竟亮還是暗。這種便利也是汽車界所渴望已久的。</p>
<p>在我們尙未談到駕駛以前。我們再來看一看後部。則見座位放寬。頂上地位加高。脚旁地位亦見寬餘。後座軟糯舒服。正是可喜。共斜度。其形態。都是經過一番縝密的研究。完全適宜於休息。軟墊。襯裹。門上執手。及其他配件。都是配合盡美。</p>
<p>內部已經看過。我們就要預備開行了。引擎已經在發動。但是你難能聽到牠的聲息。</p>
<h3 id="c221">去年美國　運貨汽車事業回顧 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 摩亞</p>
<p>汽車運輸有它一種特長。久已爲使用者所深知。因之美國的運貨汽車。在產量和用途方面。差不多是各種運輸工具中最有進步而最發達的。我回看了去年—一九三五年的美國運貨汽車產量。便可以格外的明瞭了。</p>
<p>一九三五年之末美國各汽車廠所製造的運貨汽車。其總數不下七二五，〇〇〇輛。這個數目較之一九三四年就要增加了百分之二十一。因之一九三五年的產額。除了一九二九年外。要算各年間最發達的一年。而比了一九二九年也不過相差有限罷了。一九三五年正月至八月間的產額計爲五三五，〇四一輛。</p>
<p>除國內自用。和國內市塲的需要之外。美國運貨汽車在別的市塲中也佔了一個極重要的地位。每年由美國輸往歐洲遠東非洲等各地的車輛。數也很可觀。一九三五年的運貨汽車出口。較了一九三四年已增進了百分之二十一。據佔計一九三五年一年聞所輸出的運貨汽車。其數當不下一九三，〇〇〇輛。也就是佔了全部產額中的四分之一。</p>
<p>運貨汽車事業爲什麼這樣的　達。其中也有一個很重要的道理。據政府機關的研究。發現了下面的幾種優長。　經濟。美國的車價和汽油價都不十分高昂。一决可載送的貨物又很多。因之用運貨汽車的結果。較之用別種運輸工具爲便宜。　快速服務。這是誰都可以承認的。汽車的裝載運送。在速度上總較他種東西來得快捷。　交貨便捷。汽車較火車運貨的長處。就是在交貨便捷上。因爲火車的車站往往離市甚遠。貨物一到車站。不能馬上交貨。運貨汽車的情形却不同了。它可以將貨物直接送到收貨人的門口。這是他的特點。美國的運貨汽車在全部車輛註冊數中。雖祗佔了八分之一。但是它所付的車輛特稅。却佔了四分之一。這可見運貨汽車等的發達一斑了。</p>
<p>據美國汽車製造商會的調查。美國有四八，〇〇〇個村市還沒有鐵路的服務。因之所有的運輸祗有完全靠了汽車。而這些村市的人口又佔了全國人口的百分之七。因之已往的廿五年中。他們的能和各大市區接觸。還是完全依靠了汽車的大功呢。有許多提議要把運貨汽車的運費增加。但結果是沒有實行。現在有幾州像納勃拉斯加。新墨西哥，哇克拉華麥，梅。等都施行輸入港法。雖經各方極力反對。仍舊無效。允其是運輸商。認爲這種辦法太不合法。第拉威州也因爲隣州實行此法。也依樣的實行了。這種法令據一般人的主張。對於公衆是有損無益的。因爲在各州之間。無形之中添上一種障碍。好像各國間的抽稅一樣。並且對於運貨汽車商所捐的車照利益。也認爲剝削。而不公允。康腦的干，羅特島，及第拉威州等，對於運貨汽車的取費及服務。均有法律的規定。西部四州則已更變法令。聯邦政府也頒佈管理各州間建貨汽車業的法令。已於一九三五年十月一日起實行。可是有許多人認爲這個法令。和原來的意旨有些不同。贊成或反對的都有哩。</p>
<h3 id="c222">海外車訊一束 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>一九三六年開始未幾。美國汽車事業亦挾新希望以俱來。但前途如何。目下尙難逆料。因市塲之不穩定。共情形正與前年相仿也。各汽車製造家現所冀希者。卽在本年之中。能得其投資之相當收入。於願已足。若輩一九三五年所，置之各種新機件爲値可美金一〇〇，〇〇○，〇〇〇元。其數亦弗得謂爲細微矣。所謂市塲之不穩定。範圍殊廣。就中以零售市塲之發展與否。最爲各廠所關心。當去冬新車上塲之後。各方去胃頗暢。需要甚殷。各公司推銷員亦賈其餘勇。廣爲推售。因之在六星期中。所銷之數。已頗可觀。從此一九三六年春季之銷塲將作若何景象。確爲一重要問題。至於汽車業所投資之鉅大金額。個中人對之並無焦慮之虞，因此種投資。與消耗週異。究係一種永久之置產也云。</p>
<p>汽車車頭燈之爲用。在駕駛上極關重要。但駕駛者往往漢視之。殊可異也。據第沙多汽車公司電氣總工程師費利浦開脫氏之研究。於　　三，二〇〇。〇〇〇輛汽車之後。發現每汽車十輛之中。其中頭燈有缺點者。竟佔七輛之多。開氏又稱。百分之五十五之汽車肇禍案發生於夜間。閃光及車頭燈燈光不足，均爲肇禍之一大原因云。</p>
<p>納許汽車公司經理麥克卡戴。副經理及銷售部主任勃立士。總銷售部經理考納氏遜。於歲尾春初作一大規模之業務考察。凡重要各都市。均有若輩蹝跡。自大西洋岸至太平洋洋岸。倦遊而遍。據言。此行所得之印象甚深。且殊欣快。謂一九三六年之汽車業前途。大有蓬勃之象也。</p>
<p>新式汽流式克當斯勒車之大表聲上。裝有最新式之速度紀錄表。此種速度表。除與習見者相仿紀錄每小時之車行速度外。又能令駕駛者知引擎之轉動速度。如第三排擋之轉動率。及高速度駛行之情狀。均能一望而知也。</p>

<h3 id="e12">The Central Propaganda Department Issues a Letter to the People of the Nation; Reactionaries are Using Intellectuals to Plot Rebellion; It is Hoped That Those Who Have Gone Astray Will Sincerely Repent and Extricate Themselves; The Government is Determined to Impose Severe Sanctions on Those Who Willingly Allow Themselves to be Used <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>On the 11th, the Central Propaganda Department in Nanjing issued a letter to the people of the nation, titled "Concentrating Will and Working Together for the Country." The original text is as follows: The nation's fortunes this year are becoming increasingly difficult. Our Party and government, entrusted with heavy responsibilities by the people, deeply understand that in this critical situation, we must actively prepare to gather the human and material resources of the entire nation and form a great integrated force to save the nation and seek survival. At this juncture of survival or extinction, the internal and external situations are complex and intricate. The words and actions of the people of the nation, if not careful, can affect the overall situation and lead to destruction. Recently, the people of the nation, alarmed by the urgency of the current disaster, have either expressed their righteous indignation in articles or acted on rumors. This is indeed unavoidable in human nature. However, the reactionary communists and remnants of the Social Democratic Party, at their wit's end, are taking advantage of this popular enthusiasm, seizing the opportunity to incite unrest and using cultural groups and intellectuals as tools to achieve their conspiracies to harm the Republic of China and disrupt order. Unfortunately, some people have been unaware and have fallen into their trap, being used by them. They may not have fully understood the painstaking efforts of our Party and government in planning for the country's future. We feel deeply distressed. Our Party feels it is crucial to sincerely advise our compatriots.</p>
<p>At this time of difficulty and chaos, the actions of our compatriots must be cautious. We are wholeheartedly and sincerely committed. We must understand that the wicked communists are using this kind of call for national salvation as a smokescreen for their subversive plots. We have previously heard of secret communist discussions to use cultural groups and intellectuals, under the guise of national salvation, to plan a comeback. Sure enough, soon after, a Film National Salvation Association appeared in Shanghai, followed by a Cultural National Salvation Association. Other similar organizations are probably brewing and are likely to be numerous. If you examine their declarations, they either oppose the central government or advocate overthrowing the government. All of these are using the call for "national salvation" as a cover for their treasonous behavior. All our compatriots who genuinely have patriotic enthusiasm should see through their conspiracy and not be used by them. This is the first thing we must solemnly advise our compatriots.</p>
<p>Currently, there are two major threats to the future of our nation: one is white imperialism, and the other is red imperialism. Therefore, the people of the nation, unfortunately, are misled and fall into two paths: one is to become traitors serving white imperialism, and the other is to become traitors serving red imperialism. A small number of intellectuals and cultural groups who are unfortunately used become the pawns and tools of these traitors, becoming not only criminals against the nation but also despised by humanity. We sincerely hope that those who have gone astray will sincerely repent, immediately extricate themselves, and no longer be used by others, so that the various communist-disguised organizations will naturally disappear. We also hope that intellectuals and cultural groups, who are the backbone of the people, will at all times promote the intentions of the government and concentrate their efforts to unite the people from top to bottom, so that the national crisis will be easily resolved and the nation will be easily revived. This is the second thing we must solemnly advise our compatriots.</p>
<p>The central government is magnanimous, not dwelling on the past, and moving forward with the times. People should value self-renewal. We have explained everything in detail to the people of the nation. If there are those who do not listen to advice and persist in their evil ways, then they are willingly allowing themselves to be used by the communists, willingly serving as the pawns of traitors, willingly becoming criminals against the Republic of China, and willingly becoming enemies of the nation. The government will have no choice but to be determined to cut off the viper's stinger and the brave warrior's wrist, in order to maintain social order and protect national security, and will impose the ultimate severe sanctions on them. This is the third thing we must solemnly advise our compatriots.</p>
<p>We hope that the people of the nation will carefully consider the above three points and not only make verbal statements but also have factual manifestations. We must understand that in the midst of this internal and external attack on our nation and our people, new opportunities for growth are being conceived and developed. The people of the nation must not willingly degenerate and allow themselves to be slaughtered, nor should they act rashly and be sacrificed by others. We must endure hardship, never give up, and then we can talk about saving the nation and then we can talk about saving ourselves. Our Party is the driving force behind all revolutionary initiatives, and our government is the only institution with power. We bear a heavy responsibility and dare not neglect it. We vow to advance bravely based on our principles, with the sole purpose of seeking independence and equality for our nation and seeking self-reliance and strength for our country. To achieve this goal, we will eliminate all reactionary elements as thoroughly as possible and protect all revolutionary forces as carefully as possible. Concentrating our strength, we will strive for survival. A bright future is not far away. We sincerely offer this advice and hope that all our compatriots will strive together.

The plaintiff, Sun Zijia, did not attend, and lawyer Zhang Shaozeng appeared in court. Due to the large number of people wanting to attend, only 30 were allowed inside. The judgment stated that the original judgment was revoked, and Shi Jianqiao was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for murder. One Browning pistol and three bullets were confiscated. After the verdict was announced, the presiding judge explained the verdict, saying that the defendant's self-surrender part could not be established, but Shi did not die at the hands of the law. The defendant committed murder to avenge her father, which is compassionate and forgivable, so the sentence was reduced. Civil appeals will be handled by the Immigration Court. Shi expressed disagreement with the failure to establish self-surrender and plans to appeal. (Special dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Currency System Reform Reaches a Stage <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>From the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan to the issuance of the new subsidiary coins the other day, currency reform can be said to have reached a stage. However, China has a vast territory, complex customs, and diverse customs. It is not easy to complete the reform in a short period of time. The implementation of the new currency system has been in effect for several months. However, remote provinces such as Gansu Province have recently requested the Central Government to promptly establish branches of the Central Bank in Ganzhou, Liangzhou, and other places to promote the legal tender. In provinces such as Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, the popularization of legal tender will require further planning.</p>
<p>The circulation of a country's currency is closely related to its governance. Neighboring countries covet border provinces. In today's era of aggressive economic invasion, foreign currency forces are easily infiltrated. Moreover, the obstacle to economic development caused by the old currency system was precisely that the provinces acted on their own, lacking unity, and the currency presented a chaotic and disorderly appearance. Now, if we want to popularize the legal tender throughout the country and complete the mission of a unified currency system, we must also pay attention to political efforts at the same time. Furthermore, speaking of subsidiary coins, in the past, the “jiao” (1/10th of a yuan) was not based on the decimal system. A silver yuan weighed 7.2 qian, while one “jiao” weighed 7.2 li, and ten “jiao” made one yuan. Copper coins were based on 100 coins for a 10-wen coin and 50 coins for a 20-wen coin to make one yuan. However, the government could issue them but not collect them, so it was impossible to maintain their legal value. This was also due to the lack of unified coinage. Various localities, envious of the ample casting profits, established factories and opened furnaces to cast their own coins. The central government could do nothing about it. For a time, light coins and impurities flooded the market, and supply exceeded demand, causing the exchange rate to plummet. One silver yuan could be exchanged for 300 copper coins, and some were even higher. Therefore, in the future, attention should be paid to the unification of coinage, the regulation of the currency supply, and the maintenance of the currency value. Private minting and counterfeiting should also be closely investigated at all times to prevent their occurrence, so as to guarantee the credibility of the new currency.</p>
<p>Moreover, it should be admitted that China's low level of social life makes the need for small-denomination currency very urgent. For example, during the year-end settlement period last year, one-yuan banknotes could not be exchanged for “jiao” notes, and some were exchanged at a rate of 95 percent. The lack of supply and the urgency of demand can be imagined. The issuance of the new subsidiary coins must be estimated in advance and sufficient preparations must be made so that there will be no more difficulty in exchanging them. Although the laws and regulations stipulate that unlimited exchange can be made at the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China, the people will never exchange small amounts of money at the three banks at any time, and they will inevitably seek it from exchange shops. In the past, the high or low exchange rate was controlled by the exchange industry, and profits could be made during a transfer. Now, the currency values are all decimal, and the exchange industry cannot benefit from it. They will inevitably establish tricks to take advantage during the exchange. For example, if someone holds a one-yuan banknote and exchanges it for “jiao” notes at an exchange shop, they have to pay a small fee, which means that one yuan can only get 9 jiao and 9 fen. This one-fen loss is an unexpected cost for the user, and the exchange industry will naturally be unwilling to fulfill its duty to exchange without cost. Therefore, in order to ensure that both parties do not suffer any losses, a comprehensive plan must be made to widely establish or entrust exchange institutions so that the public can exchange coins according to the legal price. As for the people's lives, the implementation of the decimal subsidiary coins will inevitably increase their burden. For example, someone who used to sell a copper coin must now sell it for half a fen, which is one and a half old copper coins. Someone who sold two coins for one fen now sells three old copper coins. The prices of miscellaneous goods have already increased. However, if the implementation of the new currency system can make progress day by day, stabilize prices, and improve people's lives, then the temporary losses will be tolerated by the people.</p>

<p>London. In the House of Commons today, someone asked the government about the issue of returning the British industry in Kuling, Jiangxi, China, to Chinese management.

<p>London. Today, members of the House of Commons questioned Foreign Secretary Eden one after another about the transfer of customs and salt taxes in North China. Conservative Party member Molson asked many questions, and Eden replied that, according to the information he had obtained, the Tianjin customs duties had not been transferred in fact. Although it was heard that the Hebei-Chahar Political Council had issued an order to deliver the Tianjin customs duties to Beiping from January 1, according to the information he had obtained, the customs duties were still being delivered to Shanghai. He knew that this matter was closely related to the interests of the British people, and he had received reports on all developments, but he had not received any news that the repayment of foreign debt had been affected. In this environment, there was no question of lodging an appeal. He had also not received any reports that the Japanese military authorities had demanded that the finances of North China be completely separated from Nanjing. Molson also asked what measures should be taken by the creditors of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, which had a monthly surplus of more than 500,000 yuan. The Foreign Secretary replied that the so-called monthly surplus of 500,000 yuan was the surplus that could be used to repay the bonds and had not yet been determined. British Ambassador Cadogan would continue to seize any suitable opportunity to ask the Chinese government to pay attention to its obligations regarding the railway debt. (10th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e43">In the United States Senate, Pittman Delivers a Speech: Severely Criticizing Japan's Policy, Violating the Open Door Policy, and Wantonly Spreading Propaganda to Threaten Peace. The United States Should Strengthen Its Military to Maintain the Treaty. <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Washington. Democratic Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today began a long-planned speech attacking Japan's foreign policy in the Senate, calling it a threat to the United States and a violation of China's Open Door Policy. According to Pittman, in December of last year, he indirectly referred to Japan as an "international pirate" at the Rotary Club in La Vegas. He then made his own criticism, claiming that several parts of his speech in the newspapers were not entirely accurate, but he would explain his attitude in detail in the Senate. Today, Pittman's speech strongly advocated that the United States maintain a strong naval and air force "until the world can respect and abide by peace treaties."</p>
<p>He believed that Japan's attitude towards China had destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty, and said that if Japan's three cooperation methods were accepted, China would be completely subjugated. On January 23, a Washington newspaper carried a report that Vice Admiral Takahashi, commander of the Japanese First Fleet, said that the United States' naval plan should be limited to national defense, and that they should prepare for Japanese warships to extend their cruising distance in the Pacific Ocean. Pittman also launched a major attack on this, saying, "Never in modern history has there been such a high-ranking official who has taken the initiative to publish such diplomatically absurd remarks. He also threatened the United States, claiming that if Japan's demands are not met, Japan will increase its navy. Takahashi believes that Japan's navy is strong and the United States will not be able to protect its commerce, but Congress will not abandon national defense or the protection of trade with China because of this."</p>
<p>Pittman also said that Japan's propagandists want to deceive the peace-loving American people with deceptive words and use the threat of war to prevent the US Congress from taking appropriate measures. Recently, Pittman also said in a speech at the Japan Society that when the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, discussed Japan's policy towards China, he clearly wanted to prevent the American people and government from commenting too much on the matter. Saito compared Japan's Asian policy to the United States' Monroe Doctrine, and said that the United States' Monroe Doctrine also wanted to preserve the democratic countries of Latin America and prevent them from being destroyed, but we have never claimed the right to conquer and control."</p>
<p>Pittman said that Japan is now controlled by the army and navy, so that the door to Manchuria has been closed to the United States. "American merchants, bankers, importers, etc. have all been driven out of Manchuria and replaced by Japan. Even American educators and missionaries will not be able to stay for long. If the conquerors all use the excuse of need to violate the sacred promises of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, then why should Japan worry about violating the promise to maintain the Open Door Policy?"</p>
<p>Pittman made a clear attack on Osaka Mainichi Shimbun's Washington correspondent, Kawakami, for spreading deceptive propaganda. Kawakami recently wrote an article saying that Stanley, the chief representative of the United States at the London Naval Conference, had agreed with representatives of other countries that if there was any difficulty with Japan, the US fleet would fight Japan in the Asian seas. Pittman said that this statement had been acknowledged by Stanley in a telegram from London, and that Kawakami also said that the United States insisted on the Open Door Policy, even if it meant war with Japan. In fact, this statement has confirmed the words of Ambassador Saito and Vice Admiral Takahashi, because "the door to China has long been closed to the United States. Even if we go to war, we must make it successful. We have not forgotten the conquest of Korea, the conquest of Manchuria is still before our eyes, and Japan's actions in North China have followed suit."</p>
<p>Regarding the Neutrality Act currently under consideration, Pittman said that the United States does not intend to give up freedom of the seas in peacetime, and that the Act clearly reserves all wartime rights stipulated by international covenants. When Pittman spoke, the gallery of the Senate was crowded and thunderous applause erupted. After the speech, cheers erupted, to the point that the chairman could not stop them. (10th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>In his speech, Pittman also mentioned the issue of freedom of the seas, saying that a certain Japanese writer had claimed that the United States was about to abandon the principle of freedom of the seas, which was not true. The United States has no intention of adopting such a policy, nor does it recognize that any government, in peacetime, has the right to exercise its power on the high seas, even within three miles of the US coast. The neutrality measures we are now preparing are within the scope of current international law and will maintain and reaffirm all of the United States' rights. This is true in peacetime, and it is no different in wartime. In wartime, if the United States deems it beneficial, it may implement certain restrictions on its people in accordance with the Neutrality Act, but this does not mean that foreign governments have the right to force the American people to accept difficulties, nor does it mean that the US government no longer has the right to take the measures it deems appropriate to fully assist its people. This is what foreign governments should understand. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Borah Also Believes Force Is the Backbone of Treaties</p>
<p>Washington. The State Department today made great efforts to state that it was unrelated to the speech delivered by Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Secretary of State Hull declared, "I have not yet had the opportunity to read the full text of Pittman's speech. Although Pittman occupies an important position in the government's legislative branch, he never consulted me before delivering his speech, and I really have no need to criticize it." Hull also absolutely denied bearing any responsibility or having prior knowledge of the speech. (10th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. After Pittman's speech was delivered, the Senate discussed it. Borah, the Republican leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also participated. It is said that it is regrettable that the American pacifists failed to firmly advocate the strict implementation of the current treaties at a recent meeting, and said, "Executing a treaty means using force, because force is the only way to execute a treaty." Democratic Senator Lewis issued a statement saying that Russia and Japan might even conclude an alliance, which must be prevented. As for the United States' withdrawal from the Philippine Islands, it is the greatest mistake. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. Lee Bishi, president of the Non-War Association organized by more than 30 peace organizations in the United States, claimed that our conquest of Japan, whether successful or not, will inevitably make the entire Asia a development site for communism. At the same time, after the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States, our country will also tend towards fascism. Therefore, Lee advocated that a second world war must never be allowed to break out again. In order to achieve this goal, all countries must now unite to save the economic crisis, and said that Pittman's proposal clearly intends to expand the US naval and air forces to the point where they can conquer Japan in order to achieve its goal of investing in China. However, in his view, it is dishonorable to go to war for this purpose. The United States should withdraw from the vortex of wars in Europe and Asia in the future and take care of itself.

<h3 id="e45">Japanese Foreign Affairs Authorities Feel Extremely Unpleasant <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>But Believe It Is Not a Problem</p>
<p>After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the content of Mr. Pittman's speech in the Senate on the 10th, they felt extremely unpleasant about his lack of knowledge of Japanese policy and his incomprehensible criticisms and slander. They are surprised to understand why such an important figure as the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee made such remarks. According to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the words of the US Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee are too ignorant, and the calm American people will not be greatly stimulated by such remarks. However, those in charge who bear heavy responsibilities have repeatedly seen in past examples what kind of adverse effects the publication of unnecessarily provocative and harsh voices has on diplomatic relations. Japan's policy towards East Asia aims to establish peace and is by no means to break the Open Door Principle or to monopolize East Asia by force. With this view, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not make Mr. Pittman's speech a problem, but will treat it as a promotional speech for the presidential election. (11th, Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. Saito Hiroshi, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, refused to comment after Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered a speech in the Senate criticizing Japan's policy towards China, but said, "Japan has no intention of closing the door to China and excluding the commerce of the United States and other countries." It is absurd to talk about a war between Japan and the United States. There is no reason to change my view, and most people in the United States have the same feeling. (10th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>The Situation Created by Japanese Policy: Pittman's Speech Has Fully Revealed It</p>
<p>Moscow. After the speech by Pittman, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was transmitted here, a certain observer of the Soviet Russian government immediately made a statement to a reporter of this agency, saying, "The situation created by Japan's outward expansion policy in the Far East has been fully revealed by this speech. This is what the Soviet Russian government has long urged the great powers to pay attention to. Even the United Kingdom is well aware of the situation of Japanese imperialism threatening peace." Pittman's speech was appropriately delivered ten days before Japan's general election (scheduled for the 20th of this month), which will naturally have some impact on the majority of Japanese voters, because the purpose of the Japanese military's intervention in domestic affairs is bound to have consequences, and Japanese voters are already uneasy about it. The only thing left for all peace-loving countries in the world is to rise up and strive to organize a collective security system to deal with it. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Only Hope That the Japanese Can Understand</p>
<p>London. When the speech delivered by Pittman, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was transmitted to London, it was too late. How the responsible parties would comment on it is difficult to know at this time. Among them, Pittman said that Japan has now decided to close the door to China, excluding the United States, even at the cost of war. People here are silent and have no expression, but they say that if we are to consider the commercial interests of the whole world, then the Chinese market should be open to both Britain and the United States, or to other countries in Europe and the Americas. The British side has repeatedly stated this view. Regarding this level, if what Pittman predicts comes true, its impact will be extremely significant, even in terms of economics alone. It is hoped that Japanese officials can understand this. In addition, Democratic Senator Lewis of the United States once said that Russia and Japan might conclude an alliance to control Asia, which would be detrimental to the United States. People here mostly think that this is purely a hypothetical term, because such an alliance has no possibility of realization under the current circumstances. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>The editorial of the Hankou English Chu Pao said that the anti-Japanese remarks of US Senator Pittman certainly represent general public opinion, but the current situation is the result of errors in Western policy. In the past fifteen years, the West has emphasized diplomacy but neglected commerce. Western officials seem to think that a small amount of trade is not worth comparing. This policy is completely different from what the Japanese are doing. In fact, China and the West have extremely important relations. It is not too late to help China now, but what is even more important than roads and railways is to enable farmers to return home and sell their products. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington. Pittman, leader of the Senate silver faction, said that there has been a substantial improvement in the world's silver market in the past two weeks. Pittman cited the fact that the financial community has purchased large quantities of silver, and criticized that India, the United States, and other parties have been extremely active in the silver market recently, and the general situation is much better than before. He predicted that new developments in Congress would affect the current state of silver or the Treasury's silver purchase policy. According to Pittman's statement, it is exactly the same as the declarations previously made by silver faction members in the House of Representatives. (10th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>The Two Countries' Actions Mirror Each Other from East to West; Germany's Arms Exports to Japan Sharply Increase</p>
<p>Moscow. The newspaper *Pravda* comments on the provocations of Japanese warlords on the Soviet Far Eastern border and the futile attempts of General Minami, commander of the Kwantung Army, to distort the facts, saying, "Japanese warlords are well aware that the current conditions are not conducive to anti-Soviet plans. At the same time, the precedents created by the Kwantung Army on the Soviet border only lead to the ruthless destruction of the invading forces. Therefore, they believe that they should retreat at this moment. However, this strategic conspiracy can deceive no one. Japanese warlords have repeatedly presented themselves as instigators of war. The slanderous rumors fabricated by Japanese officers, as well as their ridiculous legal theories and artificial plans, cannot conceal this basic fact. Their provocations on the borders of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic also serve the same purpose. They want to make the global situation extremely tense and create an environment on the border that is conducive to the future aggressive intentions of Japanese imperialism. Ultimately, these provocations provide practical assistance to Japanese imperialism and its close ally, German fascism."</p>
<p>*Pravda* further stated that newspapers around the world have reported on a Japanese-German military alliance, with Poland, Hungary, and Finland possibly joining. "Therefore, this move involves the most militarized imperialist bloc of capitalist countries, led by German fascism and Japanese imperialism."</p>
<p>*Pravda* further stated that Germany's economic assistance to Japan is increasing daily. Various newspapers have reported that Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and the German Fabe Industry Company have signed a contract, and German arms exports to Japan are increasing daily. The newspaper further commented, "Japan's provocative actions on the Soviet Far Eastern border and the border of the Mongolian People's Republic have gone far beyond the limits of East Asia, because they represent the joint actions of two aggressive countries on the Pacific coast and the Rhine River. This is by no means a coincidence. For example, the Japanese-Manchukuo provocations and the issues raised by Germany in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland coincide. At this moment, it is not difficult for us to discover the direct connection and mutual dependence between the two most belligerent, reactionary, and aggressive imperialist countries in the world. Their objectives are completely clear. Both Japan and Germany want to create a new imperialist bloc, strengthen their position, and at the same time threaten peaceful countries and undermine their cooperation through their provocative policies. This is why the recent situation is so worrying for all countries. Therefore, believers in peace must respond to the collective actions of aggressor countries with close collective action," (TASS dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>Paris. The famous Soviet general Tukhachevsky arrived here today to hold talks with French military authorities, presumably to discuss the entry into force of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. At the same time, Parliament will also debate and pass this pact starting tomorrow. It is unanimously believed here that this pact is a precursor to similar treaties signed between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and between the Soviet Union and Romania. This is intended to create a line of encirclement around Germany, with Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania, and Turkey participating in this line, while France and the Soviet Union will be in a position to jointly guarantee the current borders to cope with any ambitious country's attempts to re-divide the land, (National Telegram, 10th).</p>
<p>London. The French Parliament is scheduled to discuss the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty tomorrow to ratify it. According to diplomatic sources here, after the treaty is ratified, Germany will formally demand to re-fortify the Rhineland. If so, the provisions of the Locarno Pact may be revised, and a kind of aerial mutual assistance pact may be added to supplement it, (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>

<p>Geneva.</p>
<p>The report to be submitted by the Committee of Experts on the issue of oil embargoes, appointed by the League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen, will be finalized in Geneva soon. According to well-informed sources, the Committee will make recommendations on the commercial and financial sanctions against aggressor countries stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, and on various raw material embargo measures, so that they can be applied to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and similar disputes in the future, (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Geneva.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen originally intended to take the attitude adopted by the US Congress on this issue when voting on the new Neutrality Act as a guide to the issue of an oil embargo against Italy. According to our correspondent, proponents of sanctions here intend to advise the countries concerned not to abandon the idea of an oil embargo. The fact that the US Congress is about to extend the current Neutrality Act for another year is also irrelevant. A certain important person also told our correspondent that the report to be submitted by the Committee of Experts believes that if the US oil exports can be reduced to the export volume in 1934 (i.e., before the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian war), then the League of Nations' oil embargo against Italy will have a practical effect, (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>London.</p>
<p>According to some political figures, the issue of an oil embargo against Italy may cause domestic political turmoil. The League of Nations' Committee of Eighteen is currently discussing the embargo issue, but due to the delay in voting on the new US Neutrality Act, delaying tactics may be adopted. The members of Congress who advocate intensifying sanctions will resolutely state that this is unacceptable. Former Foreign Secretary Hoare has recovered his health and returned from Switzerland. It is said that he is determined to regain an important position in the political arena. According to his friends, he will rejoin the cabinet and accept any portfolio. However, Hoare and Simon have long had a grudge, and once they become cabinet ministers again, they will inevitably clash, (Havas News Agency dispatch, 10th).</p>

<p>Addis Ababa. Our correspondent Ochanat reports that, according to government officials here, the Ethiopian army on the southern front has occupied the Italian sentry camp in Gulati in the Ogaden region. The place is located southeast of Sassabaneh (the location of the Ethiopian army's forward headquarters), and many Italian soldiers have been killed, but the details are unknown, (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. According to semi-official news received here, the Ethiopian army is making every effort to recover Magal. General Seyoum is leading the army to attack the Italian army fiercely, but because the Italian army's defensive works are extremely solid, including three barbed wire obstacles, each about six feet high, the Ethiopian army is repeatedly shot down by Italian machine guns despite their desperate advances. After a full day of fierce fighting, General Seyoum finally retreated due to excessive losses, (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Dessie. Our special correspondent reports that at 9:20 AM on Sunday this week, several Italian military aircraft came here to drop bombs, for a total of two times. The first time, a bomb landed and exploded near St. Michael's Church, only 200 meters away from the royal palace. Then, several bombs fell around the former Italian consulate. Presumably, the Italian army suspected that the Ethiopian emperor's camp was located in the consulate, so they dropped the most bombs here, totaling more than a hundred. Two people were killed and five were injured, and three houses were burned down, (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>

<h3 id="e56">Qualitative Restrictions on Naval Issues: The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy Have Approached an Agreement; Battleships Temporarily Set at 35,000 Tons; New Naval Treaty to Begin Drafting Immediately <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>London. On the issue of qualitative restrictions in the naval conference, the opinions of the four countries of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the United States have varied, and the stalemate has lasted for many days. Until today, after the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States held talks, the situation suddenly changed, and a compromise has been reached in fact. This afternoon, the group of experts under the General Committee continued to meet to discuss the issue of battleship tonnage. It is reported that the French representative has agreed to temporarily stipulate the maximum limit of battleship tonnage at 35,000 tons. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States can prepare to build ships in accordance with their original proposals. However, in the draft naval treaty, the two countries must recognize that the ultimate goal should be to stipulate 27,000 tons as the maximum limit in the shortest possible time. The reason why the situation suddenly changed today is that the United Kingdom indicated that it could make concessions politically on the issue of inviting Germany to join the four-nation conference. Therefore, France no longer insisted on its original proposal of 27,000 tons or 28,000 tons, and made concessions to the United Kingdom on the issue of qualitative restrictions in exchange. It is reported that the United Kingdom has now agreed to first order a four-nation naval agreement, and then submit it to all other naval nations. It is also reported that the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Corbin, visited the US Chief Representative Davis this morning and immediately stated to him that the purpose of convening the naval conference was to limit armaments, so the current limit of 35,000 tons for battleships should not be regarded as an immutable method. Since a compromise has been reached on the issue of battleship tonnage, the group of experts assigned a drafting committee to draft an agreement specifically for the qualitative restrictions of other types of ships. Its content must be based on the following outlines proposed by the United Kingdom:</p>
<p>Class A cruisers: 10,000 tons displacement, equipped with 6-inch or 8-inch guns.</p>
<p>Class B cruisers: 7,500 tons displacement, equipped with 6-inch guns.</p>
<p>Destroyers and light cruisers are merged into one category without establishing separate categories. However, theoretically, their displacement should not exceed 1,850 tons.</p>
<p>Submarines: 2,000 tons displacement, equipped with 5-inch guns.</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers: 22,000 tons displacement, equipped with 6-inch guns.</p>
<p>In addition, all ancillary issues, such as Article 14 of the Washington Naval Treaty, regarding the installation of weapons on all non-commercial vessels, and Articles 15, 16, 17, and 18, regarding the construction of warships by contracting states on behalf of non-contracting states, are all to be studied jointly by the drafting committee. As for shallow-water coastal defense cruisers, they are not subject to qualitative restrictions, but should also be notified before construction, (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>
<p>London. After continued discussions at the naval conference today, it has reached the stage where treaty drafting can begin soon. The term will be approximately five or six years. The treaty will contain the points that have been agreed upon. The technical committee made rapid progress this afternoon and approved all of British Naval Minister Monsell's proposals except for the maximum type of warship. In the next few days, informal bilateral talks will be held to reach a compromise on the 35,000 tons proposed by the United States and the 27,500 tons proposed by France. The committee is scheduled to continue its meeting on Thursday, at which time it can begin the drafting of the treaty. According to Monsell's proposal: Battleships are limited to 35,000 tons, with 14-inch gun positions. There is a possibility of reducing this tonnage by 2,000 to 3,000 tons in the future. Aircraft carriers are limited to 22,000 tons, with 6-inch gun positions. This is intended to eliminate the difficulties caused by countries that have not signed the London Naval Treaty and have already engaged in building warships of the destroyer class. Submarines are limited to 2,000 tons, with 5-inch gun positions, (Reuters dispatch, 1st).</p>
<p>London. Regarding the qualitative restrictions issue of the naval conference, it was reported yesterday that the four countries of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the United States had reached an agreement in fact. It has been learned that this statement is not entirely accurate. The French delegation visited the British delegation again this morning and still insisted on 27,000 tons as the maximum tonnage for battleships. According to our correspondent, the French government has instructed its delegation to demand that the tonnage of battleships be reduced to below 35,000 tons, but this instruction is not definitive. If the four countries of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the United States cannot reach an agreement on this basis, then France still has room to change its position. In short, although there was progress in the negotiations between the representatives of the countries concerned yesterday, it would be premature to say that a formal agreement has been reached. What can be said is that the proposals previously put forward by France and Italy, namely insisting that the tonnage of battleships should be limited to 27,000 tons, may be conceded in order to facilitate the progress of the talks, that's all, (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>Paris. Czech Prime Minister Hodza visited Foreign Minister Flandin at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 PM today to discuss the issue of organizing Central European countries, until he took his leave at 5:15 PM. It is reported that the main goal of the two men's talks was to promote economic and political cooperation among Austria, Hungary, and the Little Entente countries (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia), so as to get closer to each other. This organization will integrate the Rome Agreement signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in March of the previous year and the current Little Entente Pact into a Danube River system. In the future, if Germany wants to join, it will not be hindered. It is generally expected that since the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has not yet been resolved, a general agreement on the establishment of this organization may not be easy to achieve. Hodza told reporters after leaving the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "My opinions and those of Mr. Flandin are completely consistent, and there are no differences even in trivial details." Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will discuss the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. Foreign Minister Flandin must attend the House of Representatives and has no time to meet foreign guests. Therefore, Hodza is scheduled to visit the Foreign Minister again the day after tomorrow to continue negotiations on Central European issues, (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>

Fifty members of the Iraqi Parliament jointly sent a protest letter to the League of Nations' mandatory power, saying that French policy is to blame for all the disputes in Syria now.

<p>Berlin. According to official statistics, the number of registered unemployed in Germany increased by 12,000 in January, compared to an increase of 524,000 in December last year. As of the end of January, the total increase was 2,520,000. The number of these unemployed who received government relief funds increased by 127,000 in January, and the number who did not receive relief funds decreased by 112,000. Judging from the above total number, the increase in the number of unemployed in January was very small, but the number of workers laid off by various factories was very large, so that the number of people receiving government relief funds actually increased, (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>—Ang Ruo</p>
<p>Japan has withdrawn from the London Naval Conference, while the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy have reached a compromise. However, the naval issue has become deeply entrenched, and even if these negotiations are successful, they will not have much significance. As for Japan, although it has left, its naval policy cannot be unaffected by the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries, as the positions of various naval powers are like a chain, not allowing individual actions. Here is a comparison of the naval strength of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy as of the end of last year:</p>
<p>(1) Capital Ships (Battleships and Battlecruisers)</p>
<p>The United Kingdom currently has fifteen ships, of which three are outdated, eight will reach their service limit this year, and another one will reach its service limit next year. (According to the 1930 London Naval Treaty, the service age of battleships is 20 years.) The remaining three ships were built in 1920 and 1927.</p>
<p>The United States currently has fifteen ships, of which three are outdated, four will reach their service limit this year, and another one will reach its service limit next year. The remaining seven ships were built between 1918 and 1923, so the newest one is already twelve years old.</p>
<p>Japan currently has nine ships, of which four are outdated, two will reach their service limit next year, and the remaining three were built between 1918 and 1921, so the newest one is already fourteen years old.</p>
<p>The above three countries are not currently building new battleships, nor do they have any plans to do so.</p>
<p>France currently has nine ships, of which seven are outdated, and two will reach their service limit this year. There are three ships under construction and one ship planned for construction (two ships of 26,500 tons and two ships of 35,000 tons).</p>
<p>Italy currently has four ships, of which three are outdated. The remaining two ships are so-called "pocket battleships," each with 10,000 tons according to the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. There are three ships under construction, of which two are 26,000 tons each, and the third pocket battleship is 10,000 tons.</p>
<p>(2) Cruisers</p>
<p>The United Kingdom currently has fifty-four ships, of which twenty-two are outdated (the age of cruisers is 16 years, but according to the London Treaty, those built after the end of 1919 have a service age of 20 years). There are nine ships under construction and three ships planned for construction, of which two have been tendered for construction. In terms of tonnage, there are seventeen ships between 9,000 and 10,000 tons, two ships between 8,000 and 9,000 tons, seven ships of 7,000 tons, and the rest are smaller.</p>
<p>The United States currently has twenty-six ships, of which one is outdated. There are fifteen ships between 9,000 and 10,000 tons, eleven ships of 7,000 tons, and twelve ships under construction, all to supplement the 10,000-ton cruisers (of which two have not yet been started).</p>
<p>Japan currently has forty ships, of which eleven are outdated (five are already 35 years old). There are three ships under construction and one ship planned for construction. As for their tonnage, there are twelve ships between 9,000 and 10,000 tons, two ships between 8,000 and 9,000 tons, and five ships of around 7,000 tons. The four ships under construction and planned for construction are each 8,500 tons.</p>
<p>France currently has seventeen ships, of which four are outdated. There are five ships under construction, each of 7,600 tons. The seven ships that have been completed are each 10,000 tons. There are four ships between 7,000 and 8,000 tons, and another old ship of 11,000 tons. In addition, France has thirty shallow-water gunboats between 2,000 and 2,600 tons. (According to the London Treaty, these shallow-water gunboats are also classified as cruisers, but France has not ratified this treaty.) There are two ships under construction, each of 2,884 tons.</p>
<p>Italy currently has twenty-seven ships, of which eleven are outdated. There are three ships under construction between 7,000 and 8,000 tons. Among the ships that have been completed, there are seven ships of 10,000 tons, one ship between 8,000 and 9,000 tons, and eight ships between 5,000 and 6,000 tons.</p>
<p>Germany currently has six ships, each of 6,000 tons (one of 5,400 tons). There are two ships under construction, both of 10,000 tons.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom currently has eight ships, of which one is outdated. There are four ships of around 22,000 tons and one ship under construction with the same tonnage.</p>
<p>The United States currently has four ships, of which one is outdated. There are two ships of 33,000 tons and three ships under construction, of which two are around 20,000 tons each.</p>
<p>Japan currently has six ships, of which one is outdated. There are two ships of 26,900 tons, and two ships each of 14,000 tons and 17,000 tons. There are two ships under construction and one ship planned for construction.</p>

<p>Italy currently has sixty-four ships, of which eleven are outdated. There are thirteen ships under construction.</p>
<h3 id="e90">He Jian's Report on the Pursuit and Suppression of He Xiao's Bandits <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>And the Situation of the Reorganization Teams</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army for Bandit Suppression, has returned to the province from Changde, where he was supervising the suppression. On the 3rd, he attended an enlarged memorial week and reported on the general situation of pursuing and suppressing He Xiao's bandit gang, as well as the reorganization teams and the completion of the pacification work. The following is a record of his report:</p>
<p>"Today, I will give a brief report on the recent pursuit and suppression of He Xiao's bandit gang, as well as the situation in Hunan regarding pacification and the reorganization of the teams. After He Xiao's bandit gang sneaked out from Dayong Tankou, they wreaked havoc in many places. Although the National Army pursued them urgently, the only places where there was formal contact with the bandits were Chenxi, Xupu, Longtan Siwuchang, and Bianshui Bozhou in Huangxian. The most severely damaged bandit unit was the one in the Battle of Bianshui Bozhou, which suffered thousands of casualties. The second was the Battle of Wuwuchang, which also resulted in many casualties. In total, He Xiao's two bandits originally had more than 20,000 men. After the above-mentioned decisive battles, it is estimated that no more than 10,000 armed soldiers have fled into Guizhou. On the surface, it seems that they intend to flee north of the Wujiang River. However, the Red Bandits have always been opportunistic and fled in disarray, so it is not easy to judge their true intentions. However, a month ago, the bandits had fled to the Houchang area east of Wengan. Our General Commander Liu has led 3,000 troops into Guizhou to pursue and suppress them. It is estimated that Li's detachment passed through Kaijin Longgaogou Line on the 25th to pursue and suppress Yuqing. Fan's detachment advanced from Yinjiang to Tangtou. Guo Runian's troops advanced from Minjiachang to Shiqian. Although the Red Bandits have suffered heavy losses, our pursuing troops also face many difficulties. The bandits' movements average more than 100 li per day. Our troops can barely travel 100 li, so their movements are relatively slow. The reasons for this are as follows: In terms of action, the bandits are fleeing for their lives, so their movements are faster. In terms of supplies, whenever the bandits pass through a better place, they take what they need from the homes of so-called local tyrants and evil gentry. The National Army faces great difficulties in transporting supplies. In barren areas, the bandits have looted all the food, and the pursuing troops are even more short of food. In terms of climate, the weather is severely cold, with icy and frozen ground, making transportation extremely difficult. It is not easy to transport clothing and other supplies from the rear. The bandits take advantage of this opportunity to escape more easily. Due to these difficulties, they could not be eliminated within Hunan. Now that the bandits have fled far into Guizhou, there are even more difficulties. In the past, bandit suppression operations always had supply stations to provide everything. Now, the weather is bad and there are no supply stations. All the military supplies are handled by the troops themselves. Fortunately, the morale is extremely high. Whenever the troops encounter bandits, they bravely take the lead and inflict heavy losses on them. Now that winter is over and spring is coming, and the weather is warm, as long as the bandits do not flee elsewhere, I believe that they still have the possibility of being eliminated in this encirclement. Now that He Xiao's bandit gang has fled far into Guizhou, the remaining bandits in western Hunan still include a part of the pseudo-18th Division. In other counties, there are only dozens or hundreds of scattered bandits with guns, who still need to be cleared. We are now requesting instructions from the headquarters, intending to take advantage of this opportunity to transfer a part of the troops to cooperate with the local teams to clear and suppress the bandits in different areas, and strive to complete the pacification work in Hunan in the shortest possible time and consolidate the security of the entire province. However, one thing that deserves our attention the most and should be thoroughly understood is the issue of security teams. The security teams are very important to the security of the whole province, and also has great significance for national defense. Some Hunan compatriots who are concerned about Hunan affairs have made remarks about the Hunan teams that are absolutely contrary to the facts. I have repeatedly explained this in Nanjing. Unexpectedly, recently, there are still people who say that the Hunan teams are useless and request to return the team guns for the people to defend themselves. This matter is related to the security of the entire province and cannot be ignored. Therefore, I will not hesitate to repeat a simple report. The Hunan teams were originally the former local militias. Although they have been reorganized for several years, they have not yet reached the planned goals. Therefore, it cannot be said how good they are. However, if they are dogmatically said to be truly useless, then I dare say that this is indeed a statement that violates the facts. Moreover, the achievements of the Hunan teams are indeed above those of any other province. This can be proven by facts. Before the reorganization, each county in Hunan had local militias. Most of them had one or two thousand guns, and at least six or seven hundred guns. The salaries and expenses were generally apportioned locally, and the government could not intervene. Although the numbers were unknown, it is estimated that they were not small. However, what was the situation of bandit suppression at that time? Everyone knows. Bandit robberies often occurred in Yue Li Mountain across the river. The people in Baoqing could not even leave the city. The situation in Pingliu was even worse. In other counties, banditry was often heard. After the reorganization, the first step was to unify the county. The teams in Village A and Village B, which could not take care of each other in the past, could be mobilized at any time to help each other. In the past, team guns were occupied by a few wealthy gentry as their personal property. Now, they can be used as the common property of the people of the whole county and planned as a whole. As for the team expenses, the extremely inconsistent and unfair apportionment methods of the past have been abolished, and a team tax surcharge with equal burden has been established. These are all facts that the 20 million people of Hunan have seen and heard. The former Security Command assigned the teams to different areas to be responsible for the suppression. Scattered bandits in various places have been gradually eliminated, and the local areas have been roughly stabilized. It cannot be said that this is only the power of the teams. After the unification of the province, the teams have made the greatest contribution, which is not known to the outside world and deserves to be stated. There are three things: When the Fourth Route Army left the province to assist in the suppression of the Red Bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei, only the 19th Division was left in Hunan. The area was vast and the troops were few. How could they be deployed? The security of various places in Hunan was entirely maintained with the assistance of the teams. When the National Army was engaged in a large-scale bandit suppression in Jiangxi, more than a dozen Hunan Provincial teams were transferred to areas outside the province in the border areas of Hubei and Jiangxi to be responsible for blocking the bandits, so the degree of preservation can be imagined. This point cannot be achieved by the teams of any province. When Zhu Mao's large force emerged from their nests and fled through Hunan to Sichuan, most of the Fourth Route Army had already left the province to suppress the bandits. In southern Hunan, all the troops were only one or two divisions. The disparity in numbers was great, and the situation was urgent. At that time, teams from all over the place were mobilized to guard the blockhouses and intercept them along the way, so that Zhu Mao's bandit crowd of more than 100,000 did not dare to stay in southern Hunan. This was really the assistance of the teams. Not only can the teams from other provinces not do this, but even the formal army cannot easily take on this heavy task. The teams in Guangxi have always been praised by the whole country, and the personnel sent by Guangxi to Hunan for inspection have seen that the mobilization of Hunan teams is more flexible than that of Guangxi after they looked at the Hunan teams. Some people attributed the bandit suppression in western Hunan, regarding the battle in the Lishui River Basin, to the teams. However, it is not the responsibility of the Hunan teams, and the teams have worked very hard. Because the two decisive battles to recover the lost land occupied by the bandits in the Lishui River Basin were fought by our 19th Division and various teams. When He Xiao's bandit gang fled to Anhua and Xinhua, I was still in the capital. Many people said that the teams were useless and could not suppress the bandits. After I returned to Hunan, I investigated in detail and confirmed that it was not the relationship of the teams, but the lack of effort of one or two people leading the teams. According to a certain regimental adjutant of Xu's department who escaped from the bandits and was captured, the teams along the way often only had dozens of guns, and they came out to fight with the bandits, greatly hindering the bandits' actions. Therefore, the bandits hated the teams very much. Moreover, He Xiao's bandit gang had one or two thousand men. It is not easy for the formal army to send one or two divisions to suppress them. How can the few teams be held responsible for eliminating the bandit gang? Some people also say that when the teams are transferred away from their own counties, if bandits come, there are no teams in the area and there is no way to resist. Therefore, they request the return of the team guns for self-defense. After the unified command and dispatch of the teams, the distribution of the teams is determined based on the local situation. If the bandits take advantage of the emptiness to harass the area, it is true that the area may feel empty due to the reason that the troops were not able to be transferred in time. However, if the team guns in each county are left to each county for self-defense, and cannot be under the unified command and dispatch of the security office, not to mention the coming of large bandit gangs, they cannot be dealt with by the team guns left for self-defense in the county. The teams in other counties cannot take care of each other because they are left for local self-defense. The result will surely revert to the situation before the reorganization, and the country will be full of bandits. Therefore, in the current distribution of the teams, some places are not stationed, but there are also teams that are less than one regiment, but are stationed in two or three regiments or more. This is the reason for considering the local security situation and coordinating the dispatch. Moreover, local security has a very important relationship with neighboring areas. Sometimes, stationing in neighboring counties to suppress bandits is to directly consolidate the security of the county and prevent bandits from invading the county. I hope that all people in the province will have a thorough understanding of this point. In short, the teams in Hunan cannot be said to be good because they have not yet reached the intended purpose of reorganization. However, compared with before the reorganization, there is indeed a world of difference. In particular, the item of team salaries has reduced the burden on the people a lot. In the era of the former local militia system, there were countless donations and expenses. After unification with the county, the number was more than 10 million. When it was unified with the province, it initially required more than 8 million yuan per year, and the third district in western Hunan was not included. Later, based on the view of emphasizing quality rather than quantity, it was repeatedly downsized, and now it only needs more than 4 million yuan per year, which is a reduction of more than 3 million yuan per year. In addition, the reduction and exemption of all exorbitant taxes related to team taxes are not included. In addition, there are also doubts about the item of arrears of team salaries. The security office has been instructed to prepare a detailed statement of income and expenditure, which will be published in the newspaper soon, so that all gentry in the province can thoroughly understand the actual situation. The arrears of team salaries are probably only several hundred thousand yuan. However, the additional team taxes accumulated in the people but not yet collected, excluding those that have been exempted, are still more than 3 million yuan. Therefore, the reason for the arrears of team salaries is actually due to the failure to collect additional team taxes. It is not that the management personnel have any problems. Moreover, a fund management and supervision committee has been set up to supervise and report on a monthly basis. As for some people who advocate that each county should have a team of one regiment or one battalion stationed, this is not only not possible in practice, but also the handling of the teams is entirely in accordance with the security system issued by the headquarters. Hunan Province cannot be unique. The progress of the Hunan teams is relatively ahead of other provinces. Therefore, in recent years, many provinces have requisitioned materials from Hunan Province for reference. If we must say that team guns will not be returned to each county, and the people cannot defend themselves, and the bandits cannot be eliminated, regardless of the intention, it is actually contrary to the facts. Now, the Military Affairs Committee has sent personnel to Hunan to check the teams. The inspection committee will have a clear report on what the Hunan teams are like in the future, so I will not say much. Now that He Xiao's bandit gang has fled far away, we must take advantage of this opportunity to complete the pacification work in the entire province of Hunan in the shortest possible time. I hope that all people in the province will rise up and help together, so that we can thoroughly eliminate the scattered bandits in various places in the territory. The chairman of the committee attaches great importance to Hunan and has great expectations. When he summoned students from various places for training this time, he made it very clear about his determination and methods for the future of the country. All of us in Hunan must follow the will of the chairman of the committee and move forward together, so as to shoulder the mission of saving the country and live up to the expectations of all parties. Let us all work together!"</p>

<p>Provincial Government Orders Strict Prohibition of Cultivation in All Counties</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: The funds for the Gansu Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee and the Opium Prohibition Bureau were previously instructed by the Chairman's Headquarters to be reduced appropriately. The provincial government immediately submitted the organizational regulations of the Opium Prohibition Committee to the headquarters for record. It has now been ordered to change the establishment of one section chief and four to eight section members for each section to one section chief and two to four section members for each section. After receiving the order, the provincial government believed that the matter of the Opium Prohibition Bureau was the same, and it was not appropriate to be unique, so it should also be reduced appropriately to save public funds. It was resolved at the 378th provincial affairs meeting: The funds for the Opium Prohibition Committee were reduced by one-third. The drug rehabilitation center was abolished, and all drug rehabilitation matters were entrusted to the provincial hospital. The registration office for opium addicts was abolished, and all registration matters were entrusted to Gaolan County. The funds for the Opium Prohibition Bureau were reduced by one-third. The funds for the Accountant Specialist's Office were reduced by one-third. The funds for the Supervision Office were reduced by one-third. Separate letters have been sent to the two agencies to prepare separate budgets, and they will be implemented from February 16. It is estimated that more than 50,000 yuan can be saved each year.</p>
<p>Chairman Yu of the provincial government, in order to thoroughly prohibit opium cultivation, especially issued a notice and order to the 32 counties and bureaus that had already prohibited opium cultivation, ordering them to strictly investigate and prohibit it. He also ordered the county magistrates to personally conduct on-site inspections in various villages and towns to ensure that no stems and plants were found or that opium was secretly cultivated again. It is reported that the notice has been issued, and it roughly stated: "It has been decided that opium cultivation will be prohibited in stages, and the government is determined and cannot change this. Anyone who has already planted opium must plow it up as soon as possible and replant it with crops. Those who have not planted opium must not sow opium seeds again. Be careful not to wait and see or try to experiment. After the notice is issued, if anyone dares to plant opium secretly, once discovered, the land will be confiscated in full and the person will be punished by law. There will be no leniency."</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Largest Resource in the Northeast: The Distribution of Coal Mines <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Publication by the South Manchuria Railway Geological Survey Hall: The Reserve is 4.8 Billion Tons</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Regarding the coalfields in the Northeast, according to the South Manchuria Railway Geological Survey Hall, the entire Northeast is divided into two regions, namely, the area between Tieling in "Fengtian Province" and Chengde in Rehe in the west, and Huning in "Jiandao Province" in the east, forming a straight line from the northeast to the southwest. The southern part is the Paleozoic rock layer, and the northern part is the Mesozoic rock layer. In the southern Paleozoic rock layer, there are two layers of stone coal seams. The main coalfield locations are the southeastern area of Chengde in Rehe, the area near Jinzhou in Jinzhou Province, the area east of Benxi Lake in "Fengtian Province", the southern part of Hailong in "Fengtian Province", the area near Songgang, and the Wuhu Mouth of the Far East Peninsula. In the northern Mesozoic rock layer, there is the Zhujiang stone coal seam. The main coalfield locations are the southern area of Fujin in "Sanjiang Province", the area near Heligang Linkou, the area near Mishan Lishu Bo in "Binjiang Province", the area near Jiaohe Gangyao Huoshizhen in "Jilin Province", Zhalainuoer in "Xinganbei Province", the area near Beipiao in "Jinzhou Province", the area west of Fuxin in "Rehe Province", and its vicinity. Within the southern region, there are still the Fushun coalfield in "Fengtian Province" and the Hunchun coalfield in "Jiandao Province" in the Cenozoic Tertiary period. Observing the overall distribution, the entire Northeast is divided into two parts for investigation, namely, from Chifeng in "Rehe Province" through the south of Harbin, to Luobei in "Sanjiang Province", roughly dividing the Northeast along a line from the northwest to the south. It is found that there are extremely many coalfields in the southeast, and the distribution in the west is quite sparse. Those in the northwest are mostly lignite. However, the northwest has a sparse population and is a dense forest rarely visited by people, or a vast grassland, with very few exposed strata, and there are few opportunities to discover coalfields. As for the estimation of coal reserves, it is estimated to be 4.8 billion tons. The following is a list of the output of each place (unit: ton). As for those with reserves of more than 100 million tons, they are as follows:</p>
<p>Although there are only eight coalfields mentioned above, according to recent surveys, those imagined to be over 100 million tons still include Hunchun in "Jiandao Province". In addition to the previously well-known Xinqiu in the Fuxin coalfield, the original layer has been discovered near Sunjiawan, and the increase in imagined reserves is quite significant.</p>

<p>Luo Zixiang, a notorious bandit who repeatedly committed robberies in Jinshanwei, Punan, was wanted by the 13th Brigade of the Fengxian Security Force. Recently, he sneaked back to his hometown and was arrested by Yu Zehan, the squad leader of the 12th Brigade of the Songyi Security Force stationed in Caojing. He confessed to the robbery during interrogation and also confessed the money and goods he had robbed from the victims and the people who provided him with firearms. Therefore, the brigade headquarters prepared a document and sent Luo Zixiang to the province with troops on the 11th, and handed him over to the Security Command for interrogation. The clues to the robbery of the car can be easily investigated and clarified.</p>

<p>Wu Junyu, the former director of the Construction Bureau of this county, was accused of embezzling public funds when recruiting laborers during the January 28th Shanghai War. He was reported to the former county party department by Yi Ren, a county resident. Zhu Jingzhi, a member of the Supervisory Committee, conducted a serious investigation and found that the embezzlement was true. Cheng Ruji, the former county magistrate, also found that Wu had embezzled more than 17,000 yuan of public funds. He was immediately arrested and sent to the province. The following year, he was transferred to the court for interrogation and sentenced to three years and six months in prison. When the term expired in November last year, he was sent back to the original county to recover the embezzled funds. Immediately, people from all walks of life and local gentry petitioned the county government to submit a report to the province, requesting strict pursuit to warn against corruption. The judiciary also conducted a trial, but Wu refused to repay the funds, claiming that he was unable to do so. Recently, it was heard that he will apply to seal up his property and auction it off to repay the debt.</p>

<p>At 8:50 AM yesterday, a gray strange bird resembling an eagle suddenly fell from the sky onto the roof of Taihetang Pharmacy in Shuangbanqiao, the eighth district of this county. It weighed three to five kilograms. It was spotted by a passerby who informed the store and asked them to catch the bird. It was found that there was a small wooden tag on its foot with the words "Changshou Xiangji" branded on it, the meaning of which was unknown. It is now being raised in the store. In addition, near Baojiazhuang in Nanfangquan Town, the third district, a strange bird suddenly flew from the air the day before yesterday. It was as fat as a hen, with a ferocious appearance. It soared in the sky, sometimes swooping down to catch chickens, and sometimes chasing crows and magpies. Birds in the nearby airspace have disappeared. Later, the villagers caught it with a net. There was a copper bell tied to its tail feathers, and a copper tag with the words "Sushiqiao" engraved on it. No one knows this kind of strange bird, which is very bizarre. It is also heard that a strange homing pigeon was also found in Changshu County a few days ago.</p>

<p>The Wuyi Fire Brigade Union previously felt that the 20% fire donation from various towns was decreasing, making it difficult to handle the fire service in various districts. Therefore, a meeting was held on the afternoon of the 10th. Chairman Zhu Huanzhai reported on the situation of the decrease and difficulty in collecting the 20% fire donation, and asked to discuss remedial measures. It was decided that the union would designate responsible persons in each district to collect the donation on a monthly basis and submit it to the union. It was also decided that the collection would start on March 1. In addition, the water plant operated by the association has few users and is difficult to maintain. The monthly electricity bill is very high, so it is planned to convene another meeting to request the electricity plant to reduce the fee by half, or follow the example of the Shanghai water and electricity plant merger method and have the electricity plant take over the operation.</p>

<p>The new opium addicts registration in this province started in January. In order to prevent the addicts from evading, a method of searching door-to-door was ordered. The Baojia chiefs and the Public Security Bureau would search door-to-door. The effect has been very significant in January. There are now more than 60,000 new opium addicts in the province, with Jiangdu, Changshu, Songjiang, Taicang, Zhenjiang, and Nantong accounting for the most. With the half-month deadline approaching, many wealthy households and giants in various places are still waiting and seeing and evading. A telegram has been sent again to various counties to break through the face and conduct a serious search, forcing registration. Those who have several people in one family smoking opium and only have one license are also strictly prohibited, so as to ensure that no one is missed and the six-year prohibition plan is completed.</p>

<p>In Wangji Township, Benyi, Zhuang Xingyang had a widow named Mei Yiniang. On the 8th, a matchmaker arranged for her to marry Yang Zhenwang of the same village. The betrothal gift had been handed over by the matchmaker. Unexpectedly, Yang Zhenhang, who had also coveted her for a long time, led many people on the night of the 9th and forcibly robbed Mei Yiniang. Yang Zhenwang was unwilling and reported Yang Zhenhang's robbery of the widow to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Liang Baoyu, the chief of the police station, and police officer Chen Weigong, etc., were dispatched to investigate. The villagers in the township saw the police and beat gongs to gather a crowd, surrounding the police and robbing the box guns and handguns they carried. During the fight for the guns, the trigger was accidentally pulled, and the bullet was fired, injuring Yang Yaoqing and Tian Xiao Erzi. The order was in chaos for a while, and the people then tied up police officer Liang and others, together with the injured, and sent them to the county government. On the 10th, Shan Gao, the presiding judge, held a court hearing to investigate the incident, and ordered the injured to be sent to Dasheng Hospital for treatment. Police officer Liang and others were handed over to Inspector Huang of the bureau to take them back.

<p>Licensed prostitution was strictly prohibited in this port city upon the establishment of the municipal government in 1927. Now, nine years later, due to the proliferation of clandestine prostitution and the decline of government-licensed prostitution, the income from prostitution taxes has dwindled. Consequently, the political and police authorities have jointly decided to legalize public prostitution. Regulations for its control have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and promulgation. Once "Brothel Permits," "Brothel Licenses," and "Prostitutes' Business Licenses" are printed, the plan can be implemented. Future revenue from prostitution taxes will supplement local political and police expenditures.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Letter: Letter from Landis &amp; Company <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the article in the foreign news section on the third page of your newspaper on February 6 concerning the American merchant claiming damages for inferior silk, which stated that last year's European sales of Chinese silk were active and the market improved, so that the silk mills in both Shanghai and Wuxi had made considerable profits. However, some speculative silk mills specialize in crude manufacturing, seeking only rapid production without regard for overseas credit, resulting in poor quality products. Now, various American silk factories and hosiery factories have suffered significant losses due to purchasing this Chinese silk. A special letter was sent to Landis &amp; Company, an American merchant in Shanghai managing Chinese silk exports, claiming damages of US$87,000, equivalent to approximately 260,000 Chinese yuan. After receiving the letter, the company turned to the silk mill associations in Shanghai and Wuxi to negotiate compensation. We are extremely astonished. Our firm has been involved in the export of raw silk, and we are confident in our experience in inspecting quality. All Chinese silk sold by our firm to American factories has satisfied our clients. Moreover, our firm consistently holds a leading position in the quantity of raw silk exported, which is a clear demonstration. The alleged claim for damages from silk mills is entirely unfounded. American manufacturers are extremely satisfied with the raw silk sold by our firm and would never claim damages from us. Therefore, there is no basis for our firm to claim damages from silk mills. Although the name "Landis &amp; Company" in the newspaper differs from our firm's name by one character, the pronunciation is similar, and among American raw silk exporters, only our firm, Landis &amp; Company, exists, and there is no such firm as "Landis &amp; Company." It is clear that the article refers to our firm. As this matter concerns our reputation, we dare not remain silent. We are therefore sending this special letter for correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e110">French Concession Ratepayers' Association Firmly Opposes Telephone Metered Billing <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Sends Letter to French Municipal Council Requesting Rejection, Enumerating Points of Unreasonableness, Repeatedly Refuting Their Justification</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession of this city believes that the Shanghai Telephone Company's proposed change in billing system, at a time of extreme global economic panic, is highly unreasonable. Yesterday, they listed reasons in a letter to the French Municipal Council, requesting its adoption and rejection. The original text is as follows: "To the Editor, We understand that the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Telephone Company will conduct a final review of the proposed change in the billing system this month on the 15th for decision. This matter concerns the economic well-being of citizens and could affect the prosperity of the entire commercial sector, which has already attracted the attention of all citizens. The company's newly proposed metered billing regulations are largely based on past statistics, effectively raising prices in disguise. This kind of</p>
<p>trickery has been firmly opposed by telephone subscribers. We believe that your council will accommodate public opinion, conduct a thorough investigation of this issue, and reject it. We now list the points of unreasonableness in the company's proposed change in rates below for your council's consideration. Telephones are a public utility. In most Western countries, they are state-owned, purely for the purpose of benefiting the people, and cannot be compared to other commercial enterprises that are solely for profit. Now, the Shanghai Telephone Company, with revenue from its existing 36,000 lines, is unable to obtain an annual interest rate of one percent. It insists on</p>
<p>raising revenue for 40,000 lines, unfairly distributing the burden of 40,000 lines onto the 36,000 existing subscribers. Therefore, it must raise prices and change the billing system to achieve its objective. If the number of existing 36,000 subscribers decreases in the future, it will allow the remaining subscribers to bear the increased burden. Its fundamental concept of maintaining a one percent interest rate is entirely flawed. This is the first point of unreasonableness. Since taking over the operation in 1928, the company has consistently generated surpluses of hundreds of thousands or more annually, mainly due to the expansion of capital, which has prevented the distribution of due interest. However, in the company's business performance, there has been no deficit. If the company can expand gradually according to actual conditions, it is not difficult to achieve the desired one percent interest rate. Yet, the company intends to recoup the cost of a 200,000-line telephone system from tens of thousands of subscribers. This measure, which is contrary to economic principles, amounts to</p>
<p>unjustly extracting wealth from telephone subscribers to complete its plan. This is the second point of unreasonableness. It is difficult to determine what price the company has set as appropriate. This kind of statistical data should take into account the prosperity and decline of various industries throughout the city to be accurate. Currently, the entire world is experiencing extreme economic panic, and all industries are declining. The company's desire to</p>
<p>prosper alone amidst universal decline is, in fact, impossible. Social economies are interconnected, and no enterprise can exist in isolation. This change in billing methods by the company is suitable for planning for the future but not for implementation in today's depressed market. The company's closed-door approach, without observing social conditions, is the third point of unreasonableness. According to the company's new billing regulations, residential telephones will be charged six yuan and five jiao per month, limited to 100 calls, and commercial telephones will be charged ten yuan per month, limited to 150 calls. Beyond these limits, each additional call will be charged three cents. On the surface, this seems fair. Metered billing is a common practice in various countries, but the strictness of the restrictions and</p>
<p>the severity of the charges are unparalleled elsewhere. The cost of 100 calls for a residential telephone is six yuan and five jiao, so the cost per call is six and a half cents. The cost of 150 calls for a commercial telephone is ten yuan, so the cost per call is slightly more than six and a third cents. There is no basis for determining this price. This kind of</p>
<p>skimming technique can hardly convince people and is something that telephone subscribers cannot help but resist. In our humble opinion, metered billing for telephones may be feasible, but since the charge for each call beyond the limit is three cents, what justification is there for charging more than six cents per call within the limit? If the basic price is six yuan and five jiao or ten yuan, then the limit for residential telephones should be 200 calls or more, and the limit for commercial telephones should be 300 calls or more. If the company insists on using 100 and 150 calls as the basic quantity, then the prices should be three yuan and four yuan and five jiao, otherwise we cannot consider this equitable. Moreover, according to Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the contract between the company and telephone subscribers, 'Future increases or decreases in telephone rates may be implemented with the approval of the Municipal Council at any time.' A detailed translation of the text reveals that both parties have the right to request changes, but neither party can make unilateral demands. We are sending this letter in the hope that your council will reject the company's request, thereby eliminating the brewing conflict and bringing great satisfaction. To the French Municipal Council."</p>
<h3 id="e111">First Special District Citizens' Association Warns Telephone Company to Postpone Implementation of New Regulations <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>To Await Market Recovery and Avoid Provoking Incidents</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Association of this city yesterday sent a letter to the telephone company in the concession, warning them about the impending implementation of the metered billing system for telephones starting March 1. They urged the company to consider the difficulty of defying public outrage and requested a postponement of the implementation. The original text is as follows: "To the Editor, Although your company's decision on the metered billing system has been researched by experts from various countries, the scope of research granted to these experts by the Municipal Council was too narrow. Furthermore, the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association's request to expand the scope of research was not adopted, and sufficient consideration was not given to the public will and the actual situation in the market. After repeated study by this association, we believe that the current economic depression is pervasive, and the general public is tightening their belts and scrimping and saving to struggle with this bleak market situation. Your company's desire to drain the pond to catch all the fish, forcing the situation to a dead end, is unwise and undesirable. It should be understood that it is difficult to defy public outrage and achieve selfish desires. We are sending this sincere letter in the hope that you will recognize the meaning of weathering the storm together, postpone the implementation of the new regulations, and await the recovery of the market to avoid provoking incidents."</p>
<h3 id="e112">New U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Great Pleasure at Returning to Familiar Ground, Scheduled to Take Office at Consulate Today</p>
<p>The newly appointed U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Gauss, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President Hoover. Acting U.S. Consul General Davis, Counselor Baker, and Acheson of the U.S. Embassy in China were present at the pier to welcome him. Mr. Gauss exchanged brief pleasantries with the welcomers on the ship before crossing the river by small launch. He disembarked at the Custom House Wharf at 4:30 PM. Others present to welcome him there included Administrative Consul Stanton of the U.S. Consulate and President Pan Lai and Secretary Herst of the American Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Gauss is staying at the Metropole Hotel on Jiangxi Road. His family did not accompany him.</p>
<p>Takes Office Today</p>
<p>Mr. Gauss told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency on the ship that he had previously traveled in China for many years. He was very pleased to be appointed as Consul General to Shanghai, as it was a return to familiar ground. He would follow the example of his predecessors in all consular matters. Plans for the construction of a new consulate building may not be realized for several months. It is reported that he is scheduled to take office at the consulate today (the 12th). Mr. Gauss is 49 years old, born in Washington in 1887. He joined the State Department in 1904. He first came to China on June 7, 1907, as Vice Consul to Shanghai. He returned to the U.S. two years later. In 1912, he came to Shanghai again as Vice Consul. In 1915, he was reassigned as Deputy Consul. In 1916, he was transferred to Tianjin and Xiamen as Consul. In 1919, he was transferred to Jinan. In 1923, he was transferred to Shenyang. In 1924, he returned to Tianjin. He also served as Acting Consul General to Shanghai when the former U.S. Consul General, Mr. Cunningham, took leave in August 1926. He returned to Tianjin in 1927 and returned to the U.S. in 1931, where he worked in the State Department. In 1933, he came to China for the third time as Counselor of the U.S. Legation in China. He was transferred to the U.S. Embassy in France as Counselor and Consul General in Paris on February 27 of last year. After the former U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, returned to the U.S. at the end of last year, he was ordered to be transferred from Paris to Shanghai. He returned to the U.S. from Paris at the beginning of this year for instructions and then came to China. This is his fourth visit. His rank is that of a first-class consul general.</p>
<p>Davis Transferred to New Post</p>
<p>The current acting U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Davis, has been ordered to be transferred to Singapore as Consul General. Mr. Davis told a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday that he is scheduled to take office in Singapore on April 1 and plans to leave Shanghai by the end of March to visit Nanjing, Peiping, and Tianjin before returning to Shanghai to await his ship. It is also reported that Mr. Cole, who has been transferred from Hong Kong to Shanghai as Consul, and Mr. Ander, who has been transferred from Calcutta, India, to Shanghai, will arrive in Shanghai successively by the end of this month to take up their new posts.</p>

<p>Departs Shanghai on April 14 for Six-Month Leave, Meets with Ross Yesterday Morning, Returns to Nanjing This Friday</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, British Ambassador to China Sir Frederick Leith-Ross arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing at 10:50 PM the night before. He met with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British economic expert to China, at the Cathay Hotel yesterday morning at approximately 9:00 AM to discuss various matters. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter visited Mr. Graham, the private secretary to Ambassador Leith-Ross, yesterday morning. According to Mr. Graham, the ambassador will return to England. The departure date has been set for April 14. He, his wife, and his daughter will depart from Shanghai on the P&amp;O liner Naldera. The leave will last for six months, and he will return to China before the end of this year. The ambassador's trip is a routine leave and does not involve any special mission. It is customary for British diplomats to return to England for a leave every two years. This trip to Shanghai is also in the nature of a sightseeing visit. He is scheduled to stay for three days and will return to Nanjing this Friday, possibly returning to Shanghai when it is time to board the ship. However, according to informed sources in Chinese and foreign diplomatic circles, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's return to England is actually on an important mission related to Britain's attitude towards the Far East issue. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross's return to England is partly to report on various situations in China and partly to seek instructions from his national authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Mint Is Expediting the Production of New Coins <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Announcements Are Being Made to Use Them as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The new subsidiary coins cast by the Central Mint under the order of the Ministry of Finance went into circulation on the 10th of this month. The general public is happy to exchange them due to their attractive appearance, novelty, and ease of calculation. In recent days, those exchanging coins at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have been very crowded. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have already exhausted their supply yesterday. The Central Mint is now rushing to produce more coins to meet the demand. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Announces the Use of New Coins at All Stations</p>
<p>The accounting offices of the Jinghu Railway, the Huhu Railway, and the Huhangyong Railway jointly announced yesterday that the Central Bank has issued new copper half-cent and one-cent coins and nickel five-cent, ten-cent, and twenty-cent coins starting from the 10th of this month. All stations on the railway are required to accept these coins for payment of all kinds of freight charges and passenger ticket balances. The existing copper and silver subsidiary coins must still be accepted until the government announces their discontinuation. However, all stations on the railway should use only new coins or large foreign currency certificates for the balance of passenger tickets and freight charges and should not use old subsidiary coins or copper coins for change. The new subsidiary coins needed by each station on the 10th of this month will first be sent by this office after carefully considering the quantity needed by each station as a special advance to be used for this purpose. If the new subsidiary coins are still insufficient, each stationmaster should exchange national currency certificates for them at the Bank of Communications or this office to benefit the merchants.</p>
<p>Tobacco and Exchange Industry Slightly Charges a Handling Fee</p>
<p>A person in charge of the local tobacco and exchange industry association told a reporter from the Da Gong News Agency yesterday that the new subsidiary coins began to circulate on the market only one day ago. Residents in the urban area are using legal tender to exchange them at the association's stores. All tobacco and exchange stores in the northern and southern districts belonging to the association are complying with the orders of the Ministry of Finance and are successively receiving large quantities of new subsidiary coins from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to meet market needs. However, to maintain the business interests of the industry, a slight handling fee is still charged to those who come to exchange them. The handling fee signs in each tobacco and exchange store are not yet uniform, but there are general restrictions to prevent the fee from being too high. The exchange rate for old subsidiary coins remains the same as before.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Zhisheng, the representative of the National Federation of Commerce and the General Federation of Chinese Industries who went to Hong Kong to welcome Hu, arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday aboard the French mail ship Chisha.

They are scheduled to depart on the fourth of next month. He will also accompany them and is scheduled to convene a meeting within days to report on the negotiations. Chairman Hu's reply letter states: "Respectfully replying, I am grateful for your association's concern in sending Comrade Wang Zhisheng to Hong Kong to welcome me back to the country.

<h3 id="e119">Chinese Industrial Association, etc. Hosted a Banquet for the Qingdao Observation Group Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Over twenty members of the group, including all the team members and Guo Shun, etc., attended. The group is scheduled to visit the China Alcohol Factory today.</p>
<p>Following their arrival in Shanghai, the Qingdao Industrial Safety and Hygiene Observation Group has been quite busy visiting various factories in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, they were also guests of honor at a banquet hosted by the China General Industries Federation and the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factories Joint Association. In the afternoon, they visited the China Bookstore. The details of each event are recorded below.</p>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon's Banquet</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon yesterday, the China General Industries Federation and the Shanghai Machine-Made National Products Factories Joint Association specially hosted a banquet for the Qingdao Industrial Safety and Hygiene Observation Group at the China General Industries Federation's clubhouse on Hankou Road. Those in attendance included the group's leader Wang Shouze, members Sun Siqing, Chen Yuhan, Xu Biao, Yao Junhe, Zhou Zixi, Chen Yaoyao, Guan Xibin, Li Shikui, as well as the two associations' committee members Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, Zhu Gengtao, Wang Qiyu, Qian Chengxu, Wang Zhisheng, Wu YunChu, Lu Zhixue, Cheng Shouzhong, and over twenty others. Lu Zhixue was publicly elected chairman and delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a response from group leader Wang Shouze. The hosts and guests enjoyed themselves until around 2:00 PM, when the banquet concluded.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Lu Zhixue began by delivering a welcoming speech, stating roughly, "Gentlemen, today, both of our organizations jointly welcome the Qingdao Industrial Safety and Hygiene Observation Group. We are deeply honored by your presence. In recent years, Chinese industry has shown rapid progress. However, the faster the progress, the more difficult it is to manage capital. Factory management cannot be effective without scientific methods. In this regard, there are two urgent issues that need attention: Management organization and industrial safety. Regarding the latter, after several studies, we have realized that if personnel issues are not resolved, industrial management cannot be perfected, and if mechanical equipment is not safe, workers will always be at risk. The result will undoubtedly affect production. Recently, the Ministry of Industry, feeling the need to promote industrial safety in Chinese factories, held an industrial safety and hygiene exhibition in the capital some time ago. This allowed general factories across the country, especially those interested in such equipment and enthusiastically promoting it, to visit and observe. In addition to their observation, they were able to promote improvements in their own businesses. The intention was excellent. The Qingdao industrial factories, under the guidance of Mayor Shen, organized an observation group, spared no effort to travel to the capital to study, and now, based on their observations, they are visiting factories in Shanghai for further investigation. Their spirit and perseverance are admirable. We hope that your esteemed group will generously share your findings as a reference for our colleagues. Today, we have prepared a simple banquet to wish you good health."</p>
<p>Group Leader's Response</p>
<p>Next, group leader Wang Shouze delivered a response, stating roughly, "Brothers, I am entrusted by Qingdao Mayor Shen to organize an industrial safety observation group to travel to various locations along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line for investigation, as a reference for Qingdao's industry. We have visited major factories in the capital, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, and the impressions we gained were excellent, especially from the industrial safety and hygiene exhibition organized by the Ministry of Industry. Now, we have come to Shanghai, and we are very grateful to your association for hosting a banquet and introducing us to factories for visits. However, our abilities are limited. We hope that all the gentlemen present will provide guidance so that Qingdao's industry can thrive."</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>All members of the group visited the Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 9:00 AM yesterday. Accompanied by the factory staff, they visited the weaving workshop and dyeing workshop to observe various safety equipment. They then went to the Tianli Gas Factory. After being led on a tour by factory manager Wu YunChu, it was noon. They immediately went to the China General Industries Federation on Hankou Road for a banquet. After the banquet ended around 2:00 PM, they went to the China Bookstore on Jing'an Temple Road to observe the factory's entire equipment and inquire about management and labor welfare matters in detail. They finished their work around 6:00 PM and returned to their residence to rest. They are scheduled to visit the Zhanghua Wool Weaving Factory and the Huafeng Enamel Factory this morning, and the China Alcohol Factory this afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Sugar Industry Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Offering a reward of 500 yuan to prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance revised the sugar tax regulations the year before last, tax evasion and smuggling have emerged endlessly. This trend is particularly rampant in South and North China. Last winter, smuggling also occurred in Hankou, Xuzhou, Bengbu, and other places. Recently, there were plans to smuggle sugar into Shanghai. Upon hearing this, the Shanghai Sugar Trade Association believed that it would harm national taxes above and sugar merchants below. Therefore, they convened an emergency meeting yesterday to find ways to prevent it. Three measures were decided on the spot: 1. Petition the Ministry of Finance to strictly crack down on smuggling. 2. Warn all members not to buy sugar of unknown origin. 3. Issue a notice offering a reward of 500 yuan for confidential reports.</p>

<h3 id="e122">China Merchants Bureau Appoints Senior Officials; Existing Employees to Undergo Screening <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Cai Zengji, the general manager of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, and the two deputy general managers, Tan Boying and Lao Mian, were sworn into office the day before yesterday morning. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further news obtained yesterday is reported below.</p>
<p>Qualifications of New Employees</p>
<p>The organization of the bureau, which has been approved and revised by the Ministry of Transportation, only has two secretaries. Yesterday, Cai appointed Ma Shaohuai and Chen Guoquan to fill the roles. Ma served as the secretary director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau for many years. Chen is an accounting expert and served as the bureau's chief auditor when Guo Waifeng was a commissioner of the China Merchants Bureau, so he is very familiar with the bureau's affairs. Furthermore, Chen Weiqing, the director of the bureau's General Affairs Department, resigned, and Cai appointed Wang Xiangchen as acting director yesterday. The deputy director position in that department remains vacant, and Chen Bingchi was appointed as acting deputy director. Wang previously served as the head of the second and third sections of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, assisting Cai in handling municipal government bond affairs with great success. Chen accompanied Cai when he represented the Ministry of Railways in inspecting European and American railway administration and studying the reorganization of railway debt, serving as chief secretary. He is also well-versed in debt reorganization. Cai, realizing that the China Merchants Bureau's debt urgently needs reorganization, invited Wang and Chen to take on the positions in the General Affairs Department to assist him. As for the original directors and deputy directors of the Business Department, they have already resigned. Currently, Deputy General Manager Tan is temporarily serving as acting director, and Zhou Fengtu, the former joint transportation commissioner, has been transferred to serve as acting deputy director. Zhou has worked in the bureau for many years and has studied maritime and land transportation abroad, earning a doctoral degree. Cai specially invited him to assist. Furthermore, the original director of the Shipping Department resigned, and Cai has transferred Teng Shibiao, captain of the Haili ship, to serve as acting director. Because the newly reorganized bureau has eliminated the originally established position of chief shipmaster, the director of the Shipping Department should be someone who is familiar with driving personnel. Moreover, the Haili ship is one of the bureau's four new ships, and its operation has been the most successful and economical. Therefore, Captain Teng was transferred to the bureau to oversee the department. Before Teng arrives, Deputy Director Zhou Houkun will temporarily serve as acting director. It is said that Cai adheres to the principle of talent when hiring people, so the above-mentioned positions have all been filled by qualified personnel. In addition, Cai Zhongming was appointed as the director of the Treasury, and Luo Hai was appointed as the seal supervisor. Furthermore, the manager of the Suzhou Inland River Shipping Bureau resigned, and Deputy Manager Lao Mian is currently serving as acting manager.</p>
<p>Screening to be Conducted Immediately</p>
<p>The screening of bureau employees is already actively underway. Yesterday, the Secretariat issued the first notice, stating roughly, "By order of the General Manager, each department head is required to submit a detailed report on the work abilities of all employees under their jurisdiction within fifteen days." Subsequently, the second notice was issued, stating, "By order of the General Manager, all bureau employees are required to submit a detailed report on their resumes and handled duties within two days, along with a two-inch photograph, for review." Each department head and employee is complying with the notice. This is because, before the examination is held, the work experience of each employee must first be reviewed to determine eligibility.</p>
<p>Bureau Director Hopes to Waive Exam</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau employees have an organization called the Public Welfare Association, with a total of 195 members. The day before yesterday, upon hearing about the reorganization, they submitted a petition to the General Manager requesting that the examination system be waived. They received a reply that they still had to follow the ministry's order. Yesterday, the association sent seven representatives to meet with General Manager Cai to congratulate him on his inauguration and to inquire about Cai's plan to retain 60 to 70 employees in accordance with the ministry's order, which they believed was sufficient to manage the overall affairs. At that time, Cai said that the number of employees was determined by the ministry and that he would only follow the order. As for the examination, it was also necessary to conduct screening in accordance with the ministry's order, and it was not possible to waive the exam.</p>

<p>Debate Concluded Yesterday, Rescheduled for Retrial; Due to New Facts Emerging, Investigation Underway</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan of Yancheng, the former owner of the Tianchan Stage, and Wang Xinggao of Funing were involved in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, and were implicated in the crime of instigating the assassination. The French Concession Police arrested Wang and Gu one after another and transferred them to the Special Second Court. Gu was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, and Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment. Dissatisfied, they filed appeals with the Higher Third Branch Court. On the 4th of this month, the Higher Third Branch Court opened a collegial panel to hear both cases on the same day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduling the pronouncement of the verdict for 2:00 PM yesterday. During this period, new complications suddenly arose in both cases. The Higher Third Branch Court noticed this and sent personnel to conduct a secret investigation. Due to the seriousness of the circumstances, the three prison guards who were at large were ordered to be detained, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, when the time for the pronouncement of the verdict in both cases arrived, the French Concession Police Department dispatched a reserve team and detectives as before to protect the area around the court. Another group of detectives, together with court police officers, maintained order in the First Court. The audience was also very crowded. When the clock struck two, Chinese and French police officers and French Concession detectives, together with the head of the detention center, went to Guangci Hospital to bring Gu Zhuxuan to the waiting room behind the First Court for temporary detention. Then, they went to the detention center to bring Wang Xinggao up and temporarily detain him in the waiting room upstairs. At 2:25 PM, Sun Honglin, the acting presiding judge of the Higher Third Branch Court, accompanied by Wang Yue and Li Changnian, judges, and Wu Jiayu, clerk, along with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, arrived at Criminal Court No. 1. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi represented the French Concession Police Department in court. On the appellant side, only Wang Xinggao's defense lawyer, Wu Gonglun, was present. First, Wang Xinggao was brought to the case, and after a brief inquiry into his age and origin, Judge Sun announced that after the conclusion of the debate in your case, the court discovered a new fact related to your case. After a thorough investigation, another hearing will be scheduled. Today, the conclusion of the debate is revoked, and no verdict will be pronounced. Wang nodded upon hearing the announcement and remained silent. The official ordered Wang to be taken back into custody. Then, Gu Zhuxuan was brought to the case, and after a brief inquiry into his age and origin, Judge Sun announced to Gu, "Your case was originally scheduled to be pronounced today. However, after the court announced the conclusion of the debate, a new fact emerged. After a thorough investigation, the debate will be reopened. No verdict will be pronounced today, and the conclusion of the debate is revoked. A retrial will be scheduled after the investigation." Gu asked the court what the new fact was. The official announced that he would be notified when the retrial was scheduled, and there was no need to say more today. After the announcement, he ordered Gu to be taken back into custody and declared the court adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Famous Actress Anna May Wong Enters the Country for the First Time Yesterday <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Plans to Stay in Shanghai for Two Weeks, Then Go to Her Ancestral Home in Taishan, Guangdong</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Anna May Wong, the famous Chinese-American film actress who has dedicated herself to the silver screen in the United States for fifteen years, was born and raised in California and has never set foot in her ancestral homeland. After returning to the United States from a tour of Europe last year, she suddenly felt homesick and decided to return to China for the first time. She plans to travel to major cities throughout the country, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, in order to correct her past mistakes of playing roles in some films that misrepresented the true lives of Chinese women, due to her lack of understanding. She hopes that after returning to Hollywood, she can use her current position to reintroduce Chinese women to film audiences around the world. Wong arrived in Shanghai from the United States yesterday aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Hoover. Wong's only relative in Shanghai is her elder brother, Wong Jinshu, who has a master's degree in business from the University of Southern California. He also decided to come to Shanghai two months ago. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, only her brother and two female friends she met in England and the United States went to the New Customs Wharf on a small Dollar Steamship Lines boat to welcome her. Wong wore a black long-sleeved Western suit, black stockings, and black shoes, and a specially made black cat-shaped felt hat. She met with the welcomers and Chinese and foreign journalists in the ship's reception room. Wong, who is thirty years old, is tall and healthy, and her face appears slightly aged, but her social demeanor and light makeup still remind people of her alluring beauty from her days with Douglas Fairbanks in "The Thief of Bagdad." It has not been that long since then. She first posed for photos with reporters on the deck and spoke to reporters in fluent English about her personal life, her thoughts on her film career, and her travel plans. Then, she went down to the small boat with her brother and female friends and arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 4:20 PM. After inspecting her luggage, she was advised by a French police officer to avoid the crowds in front and take the south iron gate. However, she was still surrounded by the crowd, so she seized the opportunity to enter the customs house from the main entrance across the road and took car number 4481 to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, checking into room 1201. That evening, she went to the Grovano Building on Medhurst Road for a welcome dinner hosted by Wellington Koo's sister-in-law. The United Film Corporation will also hold a large banquet to welcome this returning film star. Wong plans to stay in Shanghai for two weeks, then return to her ancestral home in Taishan, Guangdong, to visit her 72-year-old father. She may also visit Java and Bali before returning north to visit Beijing, Tianjin, Pinghan, and other places. Then, she will return to Shanghai and go to Hollywood to continue her work. Wong studied Chinese for four years and can read newspapers, but she can only speak Cantonese, which is not very fluent. She has recently paid attention to national affairs and often refuses to act in films that insult China. This return to China will surely provide her with many lessons. Her recent work was the British Gaumont Film Company's "Java Head," which was completed last year.</p>
<h3 id="e128">General Manager of American Oriental Banking Corporation, German Gräupner, Accused <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The victims are Chinese Yang Xiqing and Russian Iput De. The money they deposited with the bank was altered to call deposits without authorization. -- Gräupner is accused of embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust --</p>
<p>The American Oriental Banking Corporation closed on May 24th of last year. The American Eastern Banking Corporation, Pu Yi Trust Company, and Pu Yi Real Estate Company, which were related to the bank, were also affected and subsequently went bankrupt. After the U.S. Consular Court in Shanghai dispatched personnel to investigate, it was discovered that the bank's chairman, American Raven, and key officer Bai Lang, had engaged in embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust. The investigator then filed a lawsuit with the U.S. Consular Court against Raven and Bai Lang. Recently, Raven was sentenced to five years in prison and Bai Lang to two years. After Raven was convicted, he reportedly considered appealing, while Bai Lang admitted his guilt and indicated his willingness to forgo an appeal and enter prison.</p>
<p>Deserved Punishment</p>
<p>He has indicated that he will forego the appeal and is willing to enter prison and experience prison life. However, besides the evidence of malfeasance by Raven and Bai Lang uncovered by the investigator, Suzhou resident Yang Xiqing, who traded in gold, deposited 20,000 yuan in cash with the bank for safekeeping on April 8th of last year. After the bank closed, it was discovered that the deposit had been changed to a call deposit, preventing Yang from retrieving his money to this day. Someone named Iput De suffered the same loss as Yang. On April 30th of last year, Mr. Iput De also deposited 12,000 yuan with the bank for safekeeping, which was also changed to a</p>
<p>Call Deposit</p>
<p>Since the U.S. Consular Court has no jurisdiction over Yang and Iput De, and Gräupner, the vice-chairman and general manager of American Oriental Banking Corporation who is alleged to be responsible for these two incidents, is of German nationality, the court notified the Public Concession Police to investigate according to the law. Lawyer Ru Bao Yi of the police bureau's legal department then filed a public prosecution with the First Special District Court against Gräupner for embezzlement, fraud, and breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Hongye opened the court to hear the case. The defendant appeared with his defense lawyer Chen Tingrui and a foreigner. Lawyer Chen stated that Gräupner is currently</p>
<p>Suffering from Heart Disease</p>
<p>He is particularly attending the court today despite his sickness and asked the court to allow him to sit down while waiting for the trial. The court permitted it. Then lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated the intention of the prosecution, essentially saying that the defendant Gräupner, as the vice-chairman and general manager, was fully responsible for the American Oriental Banking Corporation. His deputy manager was the nephew of Raven, who has already been sentenced to five years in prison, also named Raven. The first victim in this case, Yang Xiqing, was originally friendly with the bank's compradore Wang Yisui. On April 8th of last year, Yang took 20,000 yuan in cash to American Oriental Banking Corporation to visit Wang and asked him to</p>
<p>Exchange the Cash</p>
<p>And give the cash to the American Oriental Banking Corporation for safekeeping. Wang then consulted the defendant, who instructed Wang to tell Yang to make it a "call deposit." The nature of this type of deposit is that it requires prior notification before maturity and payment on the due date. However, Yang did not agree with the defendant's intention as relayed by Wang. Wang then discussed it with the defendant again. As a result, Wang accepted Yang's money according to the defendant's instructions and said that the safekeeping procedures would be followed, giving Yang a safekeeping receipt for 20,000 yuan and having Yang sign and leave a seal at the bank for verification when withdrawing the money in the future. The receipt was signed by Zhu Yousong, the director of the vault, and Deputy Manager Raven. In reality, the 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Was Not Stored in the Vault</p>
<p>But Zhu and Raven signed on the receipt under the defendant's order. Although the bank's safekeeping ledger had a record of Yang's 20,000 yuan deposit, it noted beside it that it was a call deposit. To further make up for the lack of procedures, in addition to the safekeeping receipt given to Yang, another "call deposit" receipt was created and stored in the vault to comply with the rules. This shows that it was not an accidental error, but a planned act. Therefore, no one knew at first. When the bank closed, Yang asked the investigator, Hof, to return the money, but the vault was found to be</p>
<p>Completely Empty</p>
<p>With only the "call deposit" receipt remaining. The matter was then exposed. The first victim, Iput De, has already left Shanghai. His loss was 12,000 yuan, and the circumstances of his loss were roughly the same as Yang's. The difference is that Iput De originally had money deposited in American Oriental Banking Corporation. On April 30th of last year, he instructed the bank to withdraw part of the deposit and convert it to safekeeping. Therefore, he also held a safekeeping receipt, etc. The court then questioned Yang Xiqing about the facts of the matter. Yang described the entire process in detail and stated that he had always been in contact with Wang Yisui and had not directly met with the defendant. Wang Yisui, the witness, was then called to testify, stating that Yang had</p>
<p>Twenty Thousand Yuan in Cash</p>
<p>To exchange for cash and deposit it with American Oriental Banking Corporation. At the time, I asked the defendant, who asked me what Yang wanted to do with it. I told the defendant that Yang was worried that the banknotes might not be cashed in the future, so he took this action. The defendant then told me to have Yang change it to a call deposit, but Yang was unwilling. The defendant then ordered me to accept Yang's money and give him a safekeeping receipt. The banknotes were then deposited into the Bank of China by me on the same day, credited to American Oriental Banking Corporation’s account. It was not until American Oriental Banking Corporation closed that I learned that only a call deposit receipt was stored in the vault. As the bank's compradore, I was under a</p>
<p>Contractual Relationship</p>
<p>With the defendant, and should obey him absolutely, etc. Next, Zhu Yousong, the director of the vault, testified that all the procedures for changing the safekeeping deposits of Yang and Iput De to call deposits were carried out under the orders of the defendant. The court then questioned the defendant Gräupner, who stated that when cash is deposited with the bank for safekeeping, the bank should not move the money. The nature of safekeeping is different from the nature of deposit. Yang Xiqing deposited money with American Oriental Banking Corporation for safekeeping, and the receipt given was also a safekeeping receipt. How it later became a</p>
<p>Deposit Receipt</p>
<p>Is unclear. This is Zhu Yousong's responsibility. I usually focus on foreign exchange matters and rarely ask about ordinary matters. I don't understand what Wang and Zhu said because I don't know Chinese. The court then roughly told him the general meaning of what Wang and Zhu said. The defendant continued, stating that if I had ordered them to do so, there would have to be written proof, etc. Lawyer Chen then said that the content of this case is extremely complicated and cannot be clarified with a few words. The defendant intends to prepare a defense and requests additional witnesses to be summoned to clarify the truth. Therefore, he requests a postponement. Judge Qian then ordered the defendant to post a bail of 20,000 yuan and rescheduled the hearing for Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Cai's aesthetic education research institute was launched on the spot. Shen Enfu, Liu Yazi and others improvised poems.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art College, China Vocational Education Society, Hongying Education Foundation Committee, China Art Education Society, and other cultural groups, Sun Ke, Kong Yongzhi, Wu Tiecheng, Qian Yongming, Liu Haisu, Shen Enfu, and others, initiated a public celebration of Cai Yuanpei's seventieth birthday at the International Hotel yesterday. Over one hundred and seventy celebrities from party, government, academic circles attended, including Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Zhang Xueliang, Gu Shaochuan, Wu Tiecheng, Liu Yazi, Du Yuesheng, Mei Lanfang, Li Denghui, etc. The traffic on Jing'an Temple Road was heavy, making it a grand occasion. Qian Xinzhi, Liu Haisu, Yan Kechang, and others were responsible for receiving the guests. At 7:00 p.m., Liu Hairuo, a member of the preparatory committee, went to Cai's residence to respectfully welcome Mr. Cai and his wife to the venue. Everyone stood up and applauded thunderously, creating a festive atmosphere. The banquet began at 7:30 p.m., chaired by Liu Haisu. President Sun Ke was invited to deliver a congratulatory speech on behalf of the attendees.</p>
<p>Sun's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Today, we are holding this grand banquet to celebrate Mr. Cai's birthday. Mr. Cai's morality and learning are admired by the world. His contributions to society and the country have been profound and significant. Everyone here has a deep understanding of this, so I don't need to say more. There are two important meanings to our gathering today to celebrate Mr. Cai's seventieth birthday: We often say that it is rare for people to live to seventy years old since ancient times. Mr. Cai is now seventy years old and still in good health, which is cause for celebration among colleagues. Mr. Cai is not only a veteran of the party and country, but also a leading figure in the academic world of our country, admired by all. Therefore, we hope that Mr. Cai's spirit will continue to be healthy and continue to benefit society and the country. We will hold even grander celebrations when Mr. Cai is eighty, ninety, or even one hundred years old. In addition to celebrating Mr. Cai, we should also learn from Mr. Cai's past efforts for the country and society. We hope that everyone present can have Mr. Cai's longevity to shoulder the great difficulties of the future and build a country that can last forever. This is the meaning of our celebration today. I am participating in this celebration banquet today, and I will only say a few words. Please stand up and give Mr. Cai a salute. Cai then replied.</p>
<p>Cai's Response</p>
<p>Today, I am honored to have friends from the political, business, and academic circles celebrate my birthday, which I am truly unworthy of. There are many people in the party, country, and academic circles who are older than me and have more blessings, longevity, and sons. Therefore, my age cannot be considered very high. Nowadays, many people study the art of rejuvenation. Our country has also had it for a long time. Doctors such as those in the late Tang Dynasty involved the saying of immortals. Emperor Qin Shi Huang asked magicians to sail to the East China Sea to seek the elixir of immortality. Emperor Wu of Han also sought the method of immortality. This is because they had many achievements that they could not give up. However, Wu Meicun, a poet of the early Qing Dynasty, submitted to the court and later wrote many wonderful poems full of sorrow and chaos, "This disease is difficult to cure with medicine, and the hot blood in my heart" is his pain of losing the country. But if he had died ten years earlier, he would not have witnessed this heartache. The ancients said that being old and not dying is a thief. We are now at the same juncture, and there is a sense of great difficulty coming. Some people who live a few more years can still benefit the country and society, which is not without merit. Today, you are here to celebrate my birthday, and Mr. Sun's words just now are nothing more than wanting me to do a few more years of work. I am very ashamed. The ancients knew the mistakes of the past forty-nine years when they were fifty years old. I am now seventy, and there are twenty more years of mistakes. Living a few more years is nothing more than asking me to do a few more years of wrong things. As a writer, I can only do some work with my pen. In the past, every time I met Mr. Hu Shi, he always encouraged me to write an autobiography. I also wanted to use my remaining years to write something to thank society. Today, the chairmen, everyone and I wish me birthday, and I will never forget the meaning of wanting me to do my best for society and the country.</p>
<p>Founding of the Research Institute</p>
<p>During the banquet, Mayor Wu and others proposed to establish a cultural organization to commemorate Mr. Cai, because Mr. Cai has devoted himself to cultural education and art for decades, sparing no effort. Cai expressed his willingness to focus on aesthetic education in his speech, so it was unanimously decided to launch the Zimin Aesthetic Education Research Institute as a permanent memorial. Sun Ke, Kong Yongzhi, Liu Yazi, Huang Boqiao, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Tiecheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Yunwu, Liu Haisu, Pan Gongzhan, Li Dachao, and others were nominated as preparatory members, with President Sun and Mayor Wu as conveners. The banquet was filled with toasts and cheers. At 10:00 p.m., the banquet ended. President Sun immediately inscribed the four characters "Old and Strong," which Mr. Cai accepted with a smile. Wang Yiting, Yan Ganyuan, and Liu Haisu immediately painted multiple paintings of pine and cypress as birthday gifts. Shen Enfu immediately wrote a poem saying, "Occasionally I remember Confucius writing his autobiography, in that year at seventy his conduct followed his heart's desire. How much more should we respect you, Mr. Cai, as an elder statesman of the new nation, forever a teacher and admired by the scholars." Liu Yazi immediately wrote a poem, "In this era, your reputation surpasses all others, and future evaluations will surpass Confucius. I admire Lin Gengbai's saying that even the unyielding Han Yu would bow his head." For the celebration, the hosts and guests were in high spirits until 11:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Interesting Incident of Lawyer Jin Yu Encountering a Pickpocket <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>One Hundred and Fifty Yuan Vanishes Unexpectedly, Contracts, Seals, Etc. Returned Intact</p>
<p>Local Shanghai lawyer Jin Yu, whose courtesy name is Liren, has been practicing law in Shanghai for many years. His law firm is located at No. 68 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. However, Jin is tall and stout, with a large belly. At first glance, one would suspect him to be a tout, and would never think that he is a lawyer. Jin is fond of Zhou operas. Whenever he is free from work, he often accompanies his family to major theaters to enjoy the Peking operas performed by famous actors. The night before last, he accompanied his wife to the Xinguang Grand Theater on Tianjin Road to watch the full performance of "One Scoop of Snow" by famous actors Ma Lianliang, Hua Huilin, and Ye Sheng. By the time the performance ended, it was past 1 a.m. yesterday morning. At that time, Jin followed the audience out in single file. Just as he reached the exit of the gate and stopped to look around for his car, several well-dressed people resembling formal businessmen suddenly pushed past Jin. At this time, Jin suddenly felt a strange movement on the steel chain attached to his wallet in his pocket. He quickly reached into his pocket, but the wallet had disappeared. The steel chain had been cut into two pieces. Jin, who is experienced in Shanghai and naturally quick-witted, immediately turned around and grabbed one of the people who had pushed past him. Unexpectedly, this person began to speak in a heavy Beijing accent, repeatedly asking, "What are you doing?" Jin sternly ordered him to "be sensible" and dragged him into the car. At this time, the man asked Jin to go to a certain hotel first, promising to compensate him in full. Jin said that there was a total of 150 yuan in French currency in the wallet, and most importantly, it contained important contracts entrusted by the client, worth more than 60,000 yuan. In any case, they must be returned immediately, or he would go to the police station. The man asked Jin to wait a moment and immediately called his companions. Unexpectedly, the reply said that the French currency in the wallet had already been spent (meaning that they had already divided the spoils), and the people had already dispersed. Mr. Jin's wallet and the contracts and seals in the wallet had already been sent directly to Mr. Jin's law firm. Please return home to check and receive them to avoid loss in transit. As for the 150 yuan in French currency, it will be fully returned in a few days, and we will never break our promise. The man told Jin this. Jin was still half-believing, because Jin knew very well that there were no business cards or addresses in the wallet. How could they know so quickly, even if they sent someone to inquire about the address? He firmly refused. At this time, the man discussed with Jin, intending to have someone guarantee it. Jin heard that he knew that person, so he agreed. Soon, that person arrived and promised to return 150 yuan in full in the near future. After speaking, Jin hurried back to his residence by car. First, he searched downstairs, but there was no sign of the wallet. When he went upstairs to check, the items lost at the entrance of Xinguang had already been found on the balcony upstairs in Jin's lawyer's residence. After checking the items, everything was there except for the 150 yuan in French currency. At this time, lawyer Jin deeply sighed at the magical skills of the thieves and admired their superb thieving techniques. Yesterday, he specially told people to pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Shen Xin's Factories' Business Status Last Year <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>All Factories Have Surplus, Three Factories Are the Best</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing founded the Shen Xin Textile Company, which has as many as nine factories. Although there was a twist in the road the year before last, fortunately, with the strong maintenance of the party and government authorities, it was able to safely survive the difficulties. Last year, all factories were able to engage in technological and management improvements. Therefore, except for the two factories, No. 2 and No. 5, which did not start construction, the other factories have also made special progress compared to the old days. Shen Xin No. 3 Factory in Wuxi and Shen Xin No. 4 Factory in Hankou are earnestly focusing on the training of labor technology education, so the progress is very rapid. The cost per piece of yarn has reached above the horizontal level. Last year, the turnover of each factory was: the first factory had a surplus of more than 100,000 yuan, the third factory had a surplus of more than 200,000 yuan, the fourth factory had a surplus of 80,000 yuan, the sixth and seventh factories had not much up and down, and the ninth factory also had a slight surplus. It is also heard that Rong's Maoxin, Fuxin, and other flour mills, of which there are more than twelve, were also diligently managed by the managers hired by Rong, such as Wang, Lu, and Zhang. The profits of each factory are several times higher than that of the spinning mills. A reporter from Xinxinshe met Rong on the road yesterday and had a brief conversation. I felt that Rong's ambition to run real estate was no less than in the past, and his spirit and courage were better than in the past. He told me that he should devote himself to the improvement of the yarn and flour industry in the future in order to achieve the revitalization of the national industry.</p>

He is scheduled to return to China in mid-April.</p>
<p>Donation of a Bear</p>
<p>Mr. Koga, director of Ueno Imperial Zoo, in order to maintain good relations as Shen was about to leave, specially presented a large bear. Shen has already sent a letter to Xu, the acting director of the zoo, saying that the large bear donated by Ueno Imperial Zoo will be transported to Shanghai by Director Shen when he returns to China. As for the origin of the bear, it is said to be from Northern Europe or Asia, larger than a bear, with yellow and white fur, a long neck, and short legs, and able to stand upright.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Peacock</p>
<p>At the same time, Shen enclosed his opinion in the letter, proposing to return a male fish-scaled peacock raised in the zoo to Ueno Imperial Zoo. Xu, the acting director, submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau, which has also approved it. The approval document stated that it was proposed to return a fish-scaled peacock to Ueno Zoo in Japan, requesting approval. The request has been approved. This is the order.</p>

<p>Letters Sent to the Taxpayers Association and Ningbo Native Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhuang Zhen, the owner of Zhuang Mingji Electrical Company on Xiamen Road in this city, wrote to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Concession and the Ningbo Shanghai Native Association yesterday, saying: Greetings. The member has been running Zhuang Mingji Electrical Company at No. 116 Xiamen Road. On the evening of the 7th of this month, when checking the inventory in the store, it was suddenly found that four motors had been stolen, worth 300 yuan. After inquiring in various ways the next day, there was no trace. On the evening of the 8th, the member personally reported the discovery of the theft and requested investigation at the Laozha Police Station. Unexpectedly, a certain Western detective at the police station believed that the member was making a false report and refused to accept it. After the taxpayer member repeatedly stated the true situation, the two detectives showed an impatient expression, became annoyed, beat the member, and pushed him out the door. The member was innocently insulted and felt unwilling. Now the theft has been investigated by the member himself. It was done by a shop assistant named Wang. The original thief was arrested from the police station again on the 10th. This shows that the theft was a fact. The Western detective did not ask the reason and refused to investigate the theft of merchants and residents in his jurisdiction. He also beat and insulted the reporter for no reason. With such behavior, what is the use of taxpayers in the concession? The member's personal insult is a small matter, but it is a major matter related to the interests of the city's citizens. Therefore, a special letter is written, earnestly requesting your association to uphold justice and quickly forward it to the Public Works Department to investigate the negligent detectives and impose severe punishment to protect human rights and warn against illegality. Sincerely, I am extremely urgent. This is addressed to the Taxpayers Association of the Concession and the Ningbo Shanghai Native Association.</p>

<p>Loose Wooden Window Unable to Bear Weight; Climber Met Gruesome End After Theft</p>
<p>At 5:30 AM yesterday, a thief, identified as Mr. Jia, attempted a burglary at the Tianxiangzhai Cake and Pastry Noodle Shop, located at No. 422 Avenue Edward VII. He climbed from the Yuqing Lane behind the shop into a third-floor guest room and stole a set of short coat and trousers and a bag of flour. The thief carried the stolen goods to the back window of the third floor, climbed out of the window, and grabbed hold of an iron bar, intending to climb down and escape. Unexpectedly, the wooden frame and cement encasing the iron bar on the window, having been weakened by age, could not bear the weight. The iron bar detached from the frame, and Jia fell from the height into the Yuqing Lane below. The back of Jia's head shattered upon impact, his brain matter splattered, and both of his thighs were broken. He was a bloody mess and died instantly upon hitting the ground. At that time, Lu Aquan and Dai Bingyi, employees of Tianxiangzhai, were already up and picking vegetables behind the shop. They suddenly heard a loud noise outside the back door. They opened the door to investigate and discovered that the third floor had been burgled and that the thief had fallen to his death. They immediately reported the incident to the street patrol, who reported it to the French Municipal Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. At 10 AM, they reported to Qiao Wanxuan, Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the funeral home at noon. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased was an unnamed male and that his death was due to injuries sustained from the fall. The case was officially registered. The patrol detective reported the details of the case and questioned Lu and Dai, the two witnesses, about their discovery. The official ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for photographs and burial.</p>

<p>Argument with Daughter-in-Law Leads to Tragedy</p>
<p>Zhou Aqi, a resident of the Yang Family Residence on the south bank of Yuncaobang in Wusong, was over seventy years old and had a longstanding opium smoking habit. He used to run a "Swallow's Nest" (opium den) in Songjiang for a living. After the January 28th Incident, due to his advanced age, he returned to his home in the Yang Family Residence and depended on his son, Xiao Fu, and grandson, Heshang, for support. The day before yesterday (the 10th), when Aqi got up in the morning, he had no hot water to wash his face, so he went to the kitchen to light a fire to boil water for washing and making tea. However, his daughter-in-law, Yang (i.e., Xiao Fu's wife), saw this and scolded the old man for wasting firewood. When the old man tried to argue, Yang, known for her unruly temper, started a quarrel. The old man, feeling angry and despondent, decided to end his life. In the afternoon, he swallowed raw opium. Later, he started moaning from the effects of the poison. His son and grandson discovered what had happened and tried to save him, but it was too late. He died around 7 PM. Yesterday, his son purchased a coffin and clothing for the funeral. Neighbors lamented that such an old man would take his own life over such a trivial matter.</p>

<p>Deng Zhongze Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</p>
<p>The Guang Shengli Leather Factory, located at No. 368 Tiantong Road, declared liquidation in June of the 21st year of the Republic (1932) due to the impact of the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Deng Zhongze, a Guangdong native, was appointed as the liquidator. The factory's creditors, Hong Kong Guangdong and local, amounted to over 600,000 yuan. The lawyers were Wang Siji and the accountants were Song Zhenchu. However, by December 31st of last year, Deng had inflated expenses, misappropriated funds, instructed Song to forge accounting records, and destroyed old ledgers. The case was exposed when shareholder He Jinlin reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Deng was arrested and handed over to the First Special District Court on a 10,000 yuan bail. Later, it was discovered that he had embezzled over 20,000 yuan, and an additional bail of 10,000 yuan was required. Deng could not provide bail and was detained by the police. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Shuangfeng presided over the continuation of the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that it had been verified that the defendant's liquidation office at No. 10 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road, had inflated expenses for several years and had made false transfers through Mei Ya Company and Guang Shengfu and had also embezzled interest from deposits at the China Trust Company, totaling 21,547.71 yuan. He filed a public prosecution based on Article 336, Paragraph 1 and Article 210 of the Criminal Code (embezzlement and forgery of documents) and requested a severe punishment according to the law. The plaintiff also hired a lawyer to file a supplementary civil lawsuit, demanding the return of over 30,000 yuan in total. Judge Xiao questioned Deng thoroughly and sentenced him to one year imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan. The supplementary civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. During the appeal period, the bail was reduced by 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Overview of the Shanghai Tung Oil Industry <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China WeChat</p>
<p>(Thirteen in a Series of Overviews of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>Our country's tung oil has always been centered in Hankou as a distribution market, with Shanghai being only secondary. Historically, the source of goods and the rise and fall of prices have depended on Hankou. Tung oil exports began in the second year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, but Shanghai only had Western companies trading for about ten years. After the European War, domestic sales of tung oil gradually declined, while exports increased year by year, placing it in an important position in international trade. In terms of the number of exports over the years, the peak was 754,081 quintals in 1933. In terms of value, the peak was 45,820,308 yuan in 1930. However, the actual trading volume of tung oil in Shanghai is only 60,000 to 70,000 dans per year, accounting for 6% of the total exports, so its position is not very important. But since the vigorous cultivation of Zhejiang tung and the large-scale sales in Shanghai, the situation has changed slightly, and Shanghai has gradually moved away from Hankou and become more independent. Now, I will first introduce the types and sources of tung oil:</p>
<p>Types and Sources of Tung Oil</p>
<p>Tung oil is extracted from tung seeds, which are produced by tung trees. This tung tree is called the oil tung, also known as the tung tree, and is a deciduous tree. Tung trees are divided into thousand-year tung and three-year tung. The former has an extremely long fruiting period and bears very few fruits, with harvests lasting for decades. The latter is the opposite, with the most abundant fruiting between the fourth, fifth, and sixth years, and gradually declining after the seventh year. Tung seeds are the kernels of the fruits of the tung tree. Approximately 40 to 50 catties of tung oil can be extracted from every 100 catties, called white tung oil. Most of China still uses traditional methods of oil extraction, which not only makes the oil quality easy to become turbid, but also causes a very heavy loss of oil volume. Tung oil can be divided into Sichuan tung, Southern tung, Xianggu tung, Bianjiang tung, Jingsha tung, Huizhou tung, and Zhejiang tung, according to the producing area. White tung oil is cooked in a pot and refined into a dark color, which is called Hong tung oil. If other oils are added, the quality becomes sticky and tenacious, which is called Xiu oil. Therefore, tung oil has three types of distinctions in terms of its nature: white, Hong, and Xiu, which is actually only the difference between raw and cooked. However, the packaging of tung oil varies, some are in barrels, and some are in baskets. At the same time, the quality of each type of tung oil also varies, so white oil is divided into Jingfang, barrel white, Zhichou, foot-degree oil, and basket-degree, and Hong oil is divided into regular and sub-brands, and Xiu oil is divided into sharp, medium, and tail. In addition, white, Hong, and Xiu are divided into the following brands:</p>
<p>1.  White Oil – Chunyuan, Yichang, Hengchang, Dechang, Dechang, Maochang, Qichang, Yuchang, Yuchang.</p>
<p>2.  Hong Oil – Xu Rongchang, Qing Yuanfeng, Yang Hengyuan, Ji Yingfeng, Ji Changhe, Heng Changyong, Xiang Taifeng, Ji Fengying, Xiao Hengqing, Yang Hengchang, Da Changfeng.</p>
<p>3.  Xiu Oil – Wan Xingyu, Da Youheng, Ji Fengheng, Ji Taiheng, Da Youfeng.</p>
<p>Engaging in the tung oil business requires a thorough understanding of these complex distinctions. The source of tung oil is in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui, with an annual output of no less than 1.5 million dans. The transportation and sales of tung oil from each province is generally concentrated in Wanxian and Chongqing, and exported through Hankou. Guangdong and Guangxi are centered on Hong Kong, and Anhui and Zhejiang are centered on Shanghai. In the past, the source of tung oil in Shanghai, in addition to Hong and Xiu oils from the production area via Hankou, white oil also relied on Hankou. In 1923, Mr. Lu founded the Dongfang Oil Company, which operated in the Western trading style and began purchasing Zhejiang oil. Due to convenient transportation and high profits, other companies followed suit. As a result, the sales of Hankou tung oil in Shanghai were taken over by Zhejiang tung, and even the Hankou white oil sold in Shanghai is mostly adulterated with Zhejiang oil. Therefore, the Shanghai tung oil industry is gradually able to become independent from Hankou.</p>
<p>Sales and Transportation of Tung Oil</p>
<p>Before 1921, the sales volume of tung oil at home and abroad was equal, but after that they went in opposite directions. The foreign uses of tung oil are becoming more widespread, and in addition to general industrial uses, it also occupies an important position in military products, such as the outer layers of aircraft and submarines, which need tung oil for protection. On the other hand, domestic uses are limited to lubricating houses and appliances, and there is no development, so today, domestic sales are only about 16% of the total production, and 19 of the goods sold are substandard tung oil that is not suitable for export. The sales channels at home and abroad are described below:</p>
<p>1.  Foreign Sales - China's tung oil is mostly exported to the United States, accounting for 70% of the total exports. The rest is sold to Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and other countries. In recent years, the United States has been cultivating tung trees itself in an attempt to resist Chinese oil, but the results are still few. Therefore, today China's tung oil exports can still maintain a monopoly position in the world market, which is even more evident in the table below:</p>
<p>China's Tung Oil Export Statistics Over the Years</p>
<p>Most of the foreign firms that purchase tung oil in China have offices in Hankou, Wanxian, Yuezhou, Changde and other places. The local firms are Hays, Heeyi, Anli, Jiali, Lihe, Shaohe, Jiacheng, Kobayashi, Sanyi and other foreign firms, but they are of a concurrent nature. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Pirates team is still very strong in the Shanghai Association A-A Division.

<p>(Singapore Special Dispatch) The Nanyang Traveling Troupe, consisting of seventeen members from the Central National Martial Arts Academy and the National Physical Education Basketball Team, led by Chief Leader Pang Yusen, departed from Shanghai southward on the twelfth of last month and has already arrived in Singapore recently. Director Zhang Zhijiang of the Academy has also rushed from Europe to join the troupe. First, the Singapore Yiru Xuan Club held a welcome banquet. Subsequently, on the 30th of last month, the local Chinese schools jointly held a grand welcome meeting at the Great World Stadium, and it was decided that national martial arts and basketball performances would be held there the following day. Details of each event are recorded below:</p>
<p>Tea Party Welcome Circumstances. After the Nanyang Traveling Troupe arrived in Singapore, yesterday (the 30th), local Chinese schools jointly held a grand welcome meeting at the Great World Stadium. Representatives and students from twenty-six schools, including Overseas Chinese High School, Nanhua Girls' School, Guangyang School, Daonan School, Guangyu School, Zhendong School, and Lingnan Branch School, as well as over three thousand prominent figures from the community, attended. On that day, a tea party was held in the dance hall of the Great World, and a welcome meeting was held at the stadium, both presided over by Lin Yaoxiang, the principal of Overseas Chinese High School. During the tea party, Mr. Zhang Mingci from the Sanjiao Pu Mandarin Night School stood up and expressed his admiration. After the tea party, the director of the National Martial Arts Academy and members of the National Martial Arts Traveling Troupe took a group photo with the representatives of various welcoming parties as a souvenir. After the photo, the grand welcome meeting officially opened, with Zheng Zhaowu serving as the master of ceremonies. After the formalities, Principal Lin Yaoxiang of Overseas Chinese High School, on behalf of the schools, delivered a speech to Director Zhang and the National Martial Arts Nanyang Tour, expressing his admiration.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang's Speech. After the speech, Director Zhang Zhijiang was invited to give instructions. Mr. Zhang's speech mainly stated that: National martial arts and the Chinese nation have equal significance. Only with the Chinese nation can there be national martial arts, and at the same time, only with national martial arts can there be the Chinese nation. National martial arts and the founding of the Chinese nation have a certain connection. We established our country in Asia. There are two elements to establishing a country. The first element is literature, and the second element is martial arts. Without literature, the country cannot exist, as everyone knows. Without martial arts, "without fists and courage, it is the root of disaster," and naturally it is not possible. Our Chinese history spans five thousand years, with a population of four hundred million and such a vast territory. The reason why we can pass it on from generation to generation and continue to exist is because we have literature and martial arts. Therefore, literature cannot be abandoned, and martial arts must be preserved without reservation. National martial arts is a kind of sport. This sport combines physical and practical use, strengthens the body and the race, and defends oneself and the country. However, it is unique to China. Foreign countries do not have it. Even the countries with the most developed sports in Europe and America do not have such sports.</p>
<p>National Martial Arts and Basketball Performances. After Mr. Zhang's instructions, members of the national martial arts troupe performed several sections of national martial arts, including fencing, broadsword versus spear, single saber versus spear, Taijiquan, and Bajiquan. The flashes of swords and the imposing atmosphere were breathtaking. The troupe also scheduled national martial arts and basketball performances at the Great World Stadium every night at 8:00 PM starting from the 31st. In basketball, the National Physical Education Basketball Team will compete against various teams that are pre-arranged by the Singapore Basketball and Volleyball Association on a daily basis, and the performances will continue for one week. Tickets are being sold for three yuan, two yuan, one yuan, and fifty cents, four types.</p>

<p>"We would rather do it this way," "We want to stay," "Frank will take care of us"; several people shouted, and they were very happy to see that they had already gained Mr. Bhaer's trust.</p>
<p>"Isn't Mother March coming back"? Rob asked, showing a longing look; because without "Mother March" at home, as far as he was concerned, it was a world without sunshine.</p>
<p>"We two will come back tonight; but right now, good Aunt Meg needs her more desperately than you do, and I know you would be willing to lend her out for a while."</p>
<p>"Um, I'm willing; but Teddy has been crying for her all the time, he even hit Nansui, very badly and loudly," Rob replied, as if the news could urge his mother to return home.</p>
<p>Mr. Bhaer asked, "Where is my little man"?</p>
<p>"Don has taken him out to keep him quiet. He is nothing now," said Frank, pointing to the window with one hand, from which they could see Don dragging the little baby in his little car, with several dogs playing and jumping around him.</p>

<p>White lotus is very tight in the Shanghai market because the inventory is thin and the production price in Lanxi is particularly high. For example, ordinary goods were handled at 75 yuan by Guang group, and the current market price for top white lotus is called 80 yuan, but the market price is too expensive, and appetite is inevitably stagnant. Prices that are too high are difficult to see again for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Piece Goods: Pullover Cloth for Spring Sales Slow <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market sales of pullover materials for woolen suit were not active. Compared with previous years, it seems to be slower. The reason is that the price of goods is high, and buyers have a wait-and-see attitude. They will not add additional items unless necessary. In addition, the seller's credit account is particularly cautious this time. In addition, for the same quality of goods, the prices quoted by A and B are often different, which makes buyers afraid to move forward. Therefore, pullover cloth has not yet reached the peak sales period.</p>

<p>New goods of 90-pound British tinplate, which had been out of stock for many days, arrived from London in more than 1,000 boxes and were unloaded at the New Taikoo warehouse yesterday. Therefore, customers and factories who need this product in the market are vying to purchase them after hearing the news. It is heard that a certain hardware store on North Suzhou Road sold more than 300 boxes for 17.25 yuan. It is found that egg factories have also been inquiring about it in recent days. It is expected that if no goods arrive in the future, there is still a risk of a cut-off.</p>

<p>The recent transactions of American new iron are not very prosperous, but the arrivals are endless, so the circulating goods on the market feel more abundant. On the one hand, the money supply is secretly tight, which makes those who hold the goods feel panicked. Therefore, the market is very loose and cheap. It is found that 180 pounds open at 40 yuan, and 200 pounds open at 50 yuan. Except for sporadic active transactions, bulk business is rarely heard of.</p>

<p>January 1936</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday the cost of living index for workers in this city, stating that the workers' cost of living index for January 1936 compiled by the bureau was 103.64, which was 2.80% higher than that in December last year and 0.75% higher than that in the same month last year. This month, rice prices have fallen back, but the prices of flour, seasonings, and vegetables have risen sharply. Charcoal is also selling strongly due to winter sales, and market prices have risen. Therefore, this month, except for the housing and miscellaneous items index, which iron showed a decline, the remaining indices have risen uniformly. The overall index has risen higher than last month. The comparative table of various indices is listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e195">The Responsibilities of the Financial Sector in the Midst of Economic Panic <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Dihua</p>
<p>Since the European War, the economies of all countries have suffered significant losses. In order to restore pre-war prosperity and alleviate large-scale unemployment, they had to strive to open up foreign markets economically to increase international trade, in addition to political and diplomatic hostile camps. At the same time, in order to resist the dumping of products from other countries and protect their own industries, they also built high tariff barriers. This kind of economic warfare, in which each other reciprocated, became more and more serious over time, and economic panic swept the globe. Our country is no exception in the world trend. It is externally subjected to the pressure of changing currency policies and dumping markets in various countries, and internally affected by natural disasters, wars, and declining production. As a result, industry and commerce are exhausted, all industries are declining, and trade deficits are increasing year by year, forming a precarious situation.</p>
<p>Under the extreme decline of industry and commerce, the financial industry has made considerable progress. From 1931 to 1934, during these four years, the addition of banks was like bamboo shoots after a rain, constantly emerging. The annual increase in deposits and issuance, as well as the gradual increase in inventory surplus and other items, all indicate the forward march of China's banking industry. However, if we analyze the financial industry in more detail, we feel that the so-called prosperous situation is abnormal and contradictory. A country's funds are like blood vessels, and they must be connected to each other in order to fulfill their function. However, because the domestic area has lost its balance of payments under the dumping of imported products, and landlords and wealthy people have used cities as hidden pools, domestic funds have been concentrated in cities in recent years. As a result of the concentration, stagnation and accumulation of funds, the phenomenon of financial capital expansion and industrial capital depletion has also formed contradictory. Since the financial industry feels the accumulation of funds and their death in warehouses, it is difficult to recover industrial and commercial loans due to the decline of all industries. Therefore, operating highly profitable speculative businesses one day, financial stress will immediately see panic, and the rush of withdrawals will rise and fall one after another. The original funds of general banks with weak financial resources and unstable investments have been frozen, and they are increasingly unable to cope due to empty reserves. In the end, they have to close down and declare liquidation, which has formed the financial panic in recent years.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, industry and commerce should strive to strengthen the soundness of their own organizations and lay a foundation for a century with a long-term vision, and the financial industry should also seek further progress to assist in the improvement of the production industry in order to promote the development of the national economy. I will briefly describe what I have seen.</p>
<p>(1) Assist in Increasing Production and Reducing Imports</p>
<p>Many commentators believe that our country's trade deficit is a symbol of the decline of the national economy, which can fully demonstrate the backwardness of our country's industry and commerce over the years, and that if our country wants to save the economic panic, it must adjust the trade deficit. Our country is indeed the most important country with a trade deficit in the world, and the trade deficit is purely reverse, unlike countries such as the United Kingdom and Japan, which have large invisible incomes to compensate for the trade deficit. Since 1864, in 70 years, except for six years when there was a trade surplus, the rest were all trade deficits, and the numbers of the trade deficits increased with the year. The most was in 1932, reaching 556.06 million customs taels. In 1933 and 1934, although it was slightly reduced, it was also between 400 and 500 million yuan. The reduction in the deficit receipts in these two years was due to the failure to include the trade receipts of the Northeast Customs. The numbers of trade itself were low. One was due to the depletion of the domestic economy and weak purchasing power, and foreign goods failed to sell well, forming a phenomenon in which import trade receipts were lower than exports. It is not due to the development of export trade, or the progress of domestic industrial production, which is enough to replace the sales of foreign goods, so there is nothing to say that is satisfactory. The ratio of the trade deficit is equal to more than 50% of the total imports, and the severity of the situation can be imagined. The huge number of long-term trade deficits and total trade deficits over decades is unprecedented in various countries. Therefore, the trade deficit problem is a major difficulty in our country's current economy, and it is undeniable. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Yu Youqing)</p>
<p>Everything in the world is false, so the Buddhist scriptures say: "Form is emptiness, and emptiness is form." How insightful these two sentences are!</p>
<p>Originally, in this world, we come and go, which one is not false? Running to the doors of the powerful, vying for fame and fortune, which one is not false? When the king wants your life, you are still empty-handed. Isn't this the result of decades of busy work, still empty, still false?</p>
<p>Putting on a mask, no one can see whether you are Yao and Shun or a robber Zhi. Once it is exposed, you will know that you are completely false. This is the result of the last step of being a person.</p>
<p>The tone of a gambler, you "fake it," or say "don't fake it with me," seems to be a harsh warning, making the listener somewhat horrified. Because his own weakness seems to have been seen by others, he can no longer say false words, do false things, and put on false airs in front of others.</p>
<p>Many people often shout there: the sea of love is a sea of suffering, the field of love is a battlefield, and the gate of love is a difficult gate. We must not be overthrown by love or sacrificed for love. We must break everything and not enter the vortex to be a good man. But, but, although he said so, he has already been a prisoner in the field of love. Isn't this seeing through but not jumping over? As a result, words and deeds do not match, and it falls into the false way again.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Writing After Eating <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>What should one do after eating every day? This is a very worthy topic of study.</p>
<p>Dr. Hamilton, a medical doctor in California, USA, says that the best way to relax after a meal is to take a walk, play golf, or practice oriental boxing. (Note: This refers to our national martial art.) In short, one must exercise after a meal, but not engage in strenuous exercise, because lack of exercise after a meal easily leads to indigestion, while strenuous exercise after a meal can cause blood vessels to burst due to the already accelerated blood flow. This theory naturally represents a general view and is what we are most familiar with.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Goffman, a medical doctor from Germany, has a different opinion. He is strongly advocating for a half-hour nap after meals. He says that after eating, as blood circulation accelerates, the brain nerves often show signs of fatigue. At this time, even if any slight exercise can reduce fatigue to some extent, the brain nerves cannot help but increase fatigue because they have not completely calmed down all thoughts. Therefore, even after a considerable amount of recreation after a meal, one cannot work in the afternoon with the same energy as in the morning, which is clear evidence. To solve this problem, one should take a half-hour nap fifteen minutes after the meal to allow the whole body to rest completely. In that case, both body and mind will benefit, and one will be refreshed for work in the afternoon.</p>
<p>These two major schools of thought are in opposition. As for which we should follow, it is naturally impossible to say for now, because according to my observations in the office, some people stretch their legs on the desk and take a nap after a meal, while others go out for a walk in groups, but both sides are equally healthy. Some people neither take a nap nor take a walk, but simply gather together to tell jokes and talk about women, which is also very good. As for the ladies, it doesn't matter if they play eight rounds of mahjong after dinner every day. I wonder what foreign medical doctors would think of this?</p>

<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>The wind is rustling, the rain is bleak. As I was turning from the dark end of Xizang Road into Xinjiang Road, a "radiant" shop suddenly shone before my eyes.</p>
<p>Colorful electric lights tightly surrounded the perimeter of the horizontal signboard; beneath the signboard, a radio broadcasting vulgar tunes and local accents played incessantly, "Chinese learning for the fundamental principles, Western learning for practical application."</p>
<p>The spacious shop, except for a section enclosed by the counter to form a cold and quiet office area, was mostly occupied by goods displayed on the spot. In the center of the goods, under the intense light, leaned a wooden sign covered with a pasted-on red paper. Sparse words first stated that the shop had been established for many years and had a good reputation...finally: "If you can crack the following secret, you will know that our words are true:</p>
<p>"Seven people, eight eyes,</p>
<p>"Ten people, eight eyes,</p>
<p>"Outsiders, eight eyes,</p>
<p>"A Bao's mother also has eight eyes."</p>
<p>To prove that the riddle was not made up, countless narrow red strips of paper meticulously listed the types and prices of goods, making introductions and encouraging people to visit and compare as much as possible.</p>
<p>People occasionally paused, listened to the radio, and scratched their heads: "Price reductions without price reductions: price reductions without value, not more novel, but more palatable?"</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Eloquent Discussions Around the Room Lead to Litigation; Supplication for Reconciliation Leads to Old Friends Forgetting Past Grievances for Profit.</p>
<p>Bei Hai was originally unwilling to accept his hospitality, but seeing that he was being so particularly polite, he couldn't bear to offend him any further, so he laughed and said, "I really can't drink much alcohol. Three cups are out of the question. I'll just have one." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "Mr. Wang is a follower of the New Life Movement, no drinking, no smoking, which is very good. Everyone is happy today, and we must drink a little to express the joy in our hearts. Now, please have a cup, and I will drink three to accompany you." After giving this instruction, he held the kettle in his right hand and the wine glass in his left, pouring three cups in a row, all of which he drank in one gulp. Then, he picked up the empty cup and raised it, shining it at Bei Hai. Bei Hai smiled and watched as he held up the empty cup, keeping it raised as a reference, refusing to put it down. Bei Hai hesitated for a moment, then had no choice but to pick up his cup and drink it dry. Jia Duocai nodded repeatedly, saying, "Thank you." Afterwards, he clasped his fist at Bei Hai, saying, "Mr. Wang is too kind. To put it bluntly, we have already met before and can be considered old friends. If not for the relationship of old friends, you would not have been so generous. Come, come, let's fill Mr. Wang's cup again. As the saying goes, a thousand cups are too few when drinking with a friend." As he was saying this, he held the wine pot in his hand, wanting to pour wine for Bei Hai. Bei Hai was unwilling to acknowledge the words "old friend" in his heart, but he had already drunk the first cup of wine that had been poured for him. Could he really refuse the second cup that was being poured? So, he covered the wine glass with one hand and laughed, "I really can't drink anymore." Jia Duocai, holding the wine pot, still refused to take it back, laughing, "Pour it first, just to show the gesture. Surely, I can't force you to drink it, can I?" As he spoke, he shook the small copper wine pot in his hand. Bei Hai laughed, "Mr. Jia is truly skilled at persuading people to drink, making it impossible for me to refuse." So, he extended his wine glass to receive the cup of wine. Jia Duocai put down the wine pot, stood up, and bowed to Bei Hai from afar, laughing, "Mr. Wang's words truly make me undeserving. I won't force Mr. Wang to drink anymore in the future. Please, everyone, be at your leisure." Bei Hai laughed, "I will be at my leisure, and Mr. Jia need not be so polite." Jia Duocai gave a thumbs-up, saying, "Good! That's what friends are for." After finishing this sentence, he turned his head and saw that Wang Shicheng had been neglected on the side. He was holding his chopsticks, looking as if he wanted to pick them up but wasn't. He immediately realized that he hadn't even exchanged a few words with him, so he smiled and asked, "How is Mr. Wang's alcohol tolerance?" Shicheng laughed, "I don't drink." Jia Duocai gave another thumbs-up, saying, "I find Mr. Wang's words to be extremely straightforward. Based on this straightforwardness, I must invite you to drink two cups." (402)</p>

<p>At the intersection of Avenue Road and Jiaozhou Road, that section of the road is probably going to be repaired, so the workmen from the Public Works Department painted red markings on the corner of the sidewalk and wrote the large characters "No Parking" at both ends of the right side of the road. In addition to Chinese, there was also a set of English words.</p>
<p>However, one day, I saw more than seven or eight cars parked in the restricted area. I really suspected that my eyes were deceiving me. I looked closely under the cars again, and indeed there were the four large characters "No Parking." It is common to see police officers urinating under the sign "No Urinating, Offenders Will Be Arrested." The situation here was similar. Next to the road was a Western restaurant opened by foreigners, and the people who came out of the cars were all foreign aristocratic women and distinguished gentlemen. Standing at the door were Western police officers, even sergeants, judging by their uniforms. But they were watching over the cars parked in the "No Parking" zone and the "gentlemen" who came out of them. Alas, the so-called law enforcers knowingly break the law. This is a common phenomenon throughout history and around the world.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I heard Mr. Wang Yunwu say: During American Prohibition, if a commoner secretly took a bottle of wine, he would be fined, but if gentlemen ostentatiously carried bottles of wine, the police would not dare to say a word. The world is generally like this!</p>

<h3 id="e201">Japanese Local Crafts <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Our markets are filled with Japanese handicrafts. Apart from daily necessities, small crafts are the most common. These low-cost, high-profit items have greatly helped Japan's light industry develop and prosper. Every year, thousands of students from our country go to Japan to study and investigate, most of them to attend schools and conduct experiments. Very few go to factories and towns to study their small crafts. If someone could take the trouble to study them on the ground, they could greatly improve our small crafts when they return to the country. However, students studying in Japan spend a lot of money and always want to get a degree to get a promotion and make a fortune. Who would be willing to perform the farce of lifting a stone mortar?</p>
<p>Don't look down on local crafts as insignificant. You should know that local crafts are a local folk side business. If they can be improved and developed, they can stabilize the local economy. If the grass hats of Shandong, China, can be improved, they may be able to compete with those from Panama. If the Wuxi Afu dolls can change their style, they can compete with Japanese dolls. Moreover, our country has vast land and abundant resources. Almost anything can be used as raw material for handicrafts. Knowledgeable people look down on small crafts and are unwilling to study them. As a result, ignorant people stick to old methods, which will inevitably be eliminated. The old roosters and officials on the Jiangbei people's candy stands will probably remain the same after a hundred years.</p>
<p>(Explanation) It is said that at the beginning of spring at the hour of the dragon, the earth's energy shifts, and chicken eggs can stand upright on the ground. On the 5th of this month at three quarters past the hour of the dragon, it was exactly the beginning of spring. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Zhengfan invited Man Yun, Xu Suling, Huang Jingzhai, Zhang Tianchou, Zhou Hanmei, and me, eight people in total, to conduct an experiment after breakfast. We took twelve chicken and duck eggs and went to the garden of the Tarashin Village to wait until three quarters past the hour of the dragon. Each of us tried with an egg, and it really worked. Mr. Zhang also took a photo, as shown in the picture on the right. At the time, it was considered a strange tale. Half an hour later, we tried again, but the eggs fell over immediately. This shows that the legend is not false. We specially record this in the hope that scientists will provide a scientific explanation and send it to this publication for further disclosure. (Ji Ping)</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Japanese industry is developed, but apart from large factories with large chimneys and large sites, most ordinary factories use small electric machines. They only have a dozen workers and less than ten rooms. Our factories look impressive, with a tiger head sign hanging outside that says "Factory Restricted Area, No Trespassers," but in reality, it's just a facade. The factory's assets have long been mortgaged. Building factories economically and installing more machines saves capital and labor costs, which is the basic principle of Japanese small industry. Regardless of the factory, they all hire knowledgeable specialists to design and create patterns. As a result, everyone is scheming and competing with each other with originality. Therefore, their products emerge endlessly and keep up with the times. On the one hand, when new products appear in Europe and the United States, they study and imitate them, and the results are often better and cheaper than those of Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>In coastal areas, shells are produced. Nearby families pick up beautiful shells and make them into toys. Two shells combined become the belly of a bird, and the head of a snail shell can be made into various different birds. Ornaments carved from clam shells are white and shiny, similar to our ivory carvings. Our family chemical company's clam honey utilizes nature in the same way. In Japan, storing food and toys in large clams is also the same. Clay figures are as modern as reality. The clay figures are dressed in beautiful silk clothes and have already become objects of appreciation for adults rather than just toys for children. They can imitate men and women of all countries, and actors and stars are their models. First, artists carve models based on photos, and then gradually reproduce them. Each person's clothes and posture are based on magazine photos. Therefore, they have a strong appeal when placed in the showcase. Anyone who walks past wants to stop and admire them. The highest prices reach over one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>There are countless kinds of celluloid toys and iron and wooden trains and cars. Recently, celluloid dolls have also been dressed in tulle clothes, which adds a lot of beauty. In addition, the bodies are equipped with clockwork, allowing them to walk and swim. These small crafts cannot be learned in school. You can only collect and buy them in various places to study and improve them. If our small factories want to compete with Japanese goods, they must first ask someone to collect them, and then imitate and improve them. This is twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>It can be said that there is no place in Japan without local products. This shows the development of local crafts. Hokkaido produces wood, so they use various tree barks and branches to make stationery, which is also simple and lovely. In some places, bears are produced, so the people carve bears out of wood and turn them into decorations. Other crafts such as bamboo work, lacquer work, and wheat straw work are all very interesting. Because the patterns and styles are constantly striving for novelty and beauty, they can attract customers. Suppose there is a cigarette case made of porcelain, tin, wood, bamboo, glass, pottery, shells, etc. In addition to glass and tin, the lampshades for electric lights come in several types, including silk, printed paper, celluloid, and bamboo frames. Their crafts are beautiful and harmonious in color and up-to-date in style. They are all modern utensils and will never stick to old methods. Recently, the Japanese have been paying close attention to the war between Italy and Abyssinia. They have taken advantage of this and have already manufactured many black soldiers for sale.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Various Treatments for Gonorrhea <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>The medicines and instruments for treating gonorrhea have become dazzling in modern times. However, analyzing the treatments, there are no more than four types. What are these four types? They are: (1) Oral medication. One should choose excellent preparations with strong penetrating power and anti-inflammatory and bactericidal properties. For example, "Metsalin," sold by the German-owned Meihe Trading Company, can be said to be flawless in these aspects. (2) Local therapy. Silver protein and other preparations are usually used to make local irrigation solutions. When using this type of therapy, if the duration of use and the concentration of the solution are not appropriate, it can be said to be ineffective. Since the invention of "Gonorrhea Soother" by the German Manerzhi Pharmaceutical Factory, many in the medical and pharmaceutical fields have switched to using it because it is a mixture of gonorrhea serum and Soother, which has the effect of immunizing and curing gonorrhea. (3) Injection therapy. Injections of pigments and mixed gonorrhea vaccines. Good preparations of pigments include Terupafflavin from Tiande Pharmaceutical Factory, and excellent mixed gonorrhea vaccines include "Manerzhi Turbid Mixture Vaccine" from the German-owned Gaofu Trading Company. These two use medicinal power to kill bacteria and automatic immunization, respectively. Using them alternately can be said to be appropriate. (4) Electrical therapy. Based on heat sterilization, the so-called diathermy sterilization, shortwave diathermy is the most valuable. The use of Furke's purple light electricity and long-wave diathermy is difficult to achieve satisfactory results, and may even prolong the recovery period, not to mention the drawbacks of burning the skin. In addition, for urethral gonorrhea, meaning that the symptoms are entirely in the urethra, irradiation with cold light from a mercury quartz lamp, the so-called photosterilization, also has considerable effect.</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Harmful Effects of Opium on the Human Body and Its Withdrawal Symptoms <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Physician She Lei</p>
<p>Anyone addicted to opium must consume a certain amount of opium every day, otherwise, withdrawal symptoms will appear immediately (commonly known as "detox"). I will briefly describe several types as follows: (1) Increased secretions. The secretions of the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, and mucous glands of the upper respiratory tract all increase sharply. The most obvious manifestation is tearing. (2) Gastrointestinal disorders, such as belching, vomiting, and diarrhea. (3) The reproductive organs also undergo significant changes, such as excessive menstruation in women and spermatorrhea and increased libido in men. (4) Insomnia. This type of insomnia cannot be effectively treated with hypnotics. (5) Changes in the circulatory system. The pulse becomes weak and rapid. In severe cases, it can lead to collapse or death from heart failure. (6) Others, such as yawning, sneezing, and aching limbs. The reason for these phenomena is the result of opium harming the human body. All chronic opium addicts have these phenomena. The harmful effects of opium can be divided into mental and physical aspects. The mental aspects are difficult to describe, so I will omit them. As for the physical aspects, those that can be demonstrated by objective observation include: (1) Lack of subcutaneous fat. The skin is loose and sagging. Nine out of ten smokers are thin all over. Those with severe addiction are even worse. (2) Secretions are all impaired. The secretions of the salivary glands and sebaceous glands are reduced. This can be inferred from dry skin. The secretions of the digestive glands are also impaired. This can be inferred from loss of appetite, indigestion, and irregular bowel movements. (3) Reproductive function is also weakened, such as impotence in men and amenorrhea in women. (4) Changes in the circulatory system are also significant. The pulse is slow and irregular. If the source of opium toxins can be reduced or eliminated, it will not be difficult to eliminate the above symptoms and restore the original healthy state.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Various Causes of Stomach Pain <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Fangweng</p>
<p>Stomach pain is usually not an isolated symptom and is often accompanied by acid reflux, belching, and vomiting. The causes of these symptoms are usually acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, and excessive stomach acid. When treating these conditions with medication, only Algarin preparations are effective. If the stomach pain is acute, a strong analgesic can be added at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Superior Algarin Preparations <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Qiuping</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Algarin preparations are good remedies for stomach ailments, especially for stomach pain caused by excessive stomach acid. They are also effective for vomiting and acid reflux. There are many such preparations, too numerous to mention. After careful selection, I only like "Stomach Treasure." This medicine is not only a superior Algarin preparation but also contains a powerful analgesic that does not contain narcotics. Therefore, it is effective for stomach pain and can provide immediate relief. It is truly a miracle drug.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Skin Disease Treatment Agent <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhifang</p>
<p>Skin diseases are highly contagious. The most common are ringworm and scabies. Bathing together, anything that can directly contact the skin, even with slight carelessness, can be infected. However, many people ignore these ringworm and scabies, thinking they are minor ailments that are not of great importance. They only pay attention to them when the symptoms worsen. Effective agents that are usually applied to these types of ailments include "Scabies Killer," salicylic acid, zinc oxide, boric acid, etc. However, an appropriate ointment must have all the following characteristics: (1) Strong bactericidal power without harming the skin in the slightest. (2) Does not harm the internal organs due to skin absorption. (3) Does not stain clothes and has a fragrant odor. Only those with these three characteristics can be called superior products. In my clinical practice, I often use "Germ Killer" for patients with ringworm and scabies. I use this medicine because it combines various famous medicines for skin diseases in one, and it has all the above advantages when applied. In addition to scabies and ringworm, it is also effective for eczema, blisters, acne rosacea, etc. It is highly effective in curing diseases.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation are both symptoms of sexual neurasthenia. Most cases of this disease are caused by excessive sexual activity and masturbation. Human semen is most precious. Its source is the testicles, and it is used by the epididymis to transport it to the seminal vesicles. Part of it flows into the lymphatic vessels to the blood vessels and circulates in the blood as nutrition, and part of it returns to the testicles through the arteries to become semen again. Semen circulation, excessive spermatorrhea, and excessive masturbation and sexual activity can cause excessive consumption of semen. The new blood produced physiologically is insufficient to replenish it. As a result, premature ejaculation and spermatorrhea, even the nervous system, are affected, leading to neurasthenia. Not only that, but other diseases such as brain disease and heart disease will also follow. Therefore, spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation must never be ignored, as they can endanger life. The treatment for this disease can be said to emphasize both medication and mental health. Such as correct thinking, abstinence from desires, avoiding overwork, strict adherence to hygiene, and choosing nutritious foods. The use of drugs, such as organic phosphorus and endocrine, are considered reasonable. "Anershen," a mixed preparation of these, is highly recommended by the medical and pharmaceutical communities. Electrical therapy, galvanic electricity, and prostate massage are also effective.</p>

<p>Solution Leakage</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Xu Yingnan) I used to suffer from spermatorrhea, but I recovered a long time ago. Recently, I suddenly noticed a white, milky liquid leaking from my urethra, but it is very sparse and painless. I cannot identify the disease and would like to know what medicine to use to treat it.</p>
<p>Answer: This is a symptom of chronic gonorrhea. In addition to extreme self-care, you can use "Miesha Lin" internally and "Lindu Shule'er" externally for drug treatment, and you should be able to recover on your own.</p>
<p>Pregnancy or Illness</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Lu Naikang) A relative of mine is 32 years old and had a difficult birth six years ago. According to the doctor at the time, her uterus had a problem. For several years since then, she has had no other problems except for slight discomfort during menstruation. Recently, her period has stopped for three months. I don't know if it is pregnancy or illness. Please advise.</p>
<p>Answer: Based solely on your letter, I cannot make a definitive judgment. Please consult a gynecologist or undergo a pregnancy test. Dr. Hayes, a German medical doctor specializing in gynecology, is on the second floor of Chunzai Hospital at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai. You can go there for a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Long Time Without Bathing</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Ni Liuru) I previously suffered from a venereal disease and have not bathed for a long time. After the venereal disease healed, my skin developed severe itching. The itching is worse when I am in a warm bed at night. Looking at the itchy area, there are only small, goosebump-like particles. It seems like scabies but not scabies, like ringworm but not ringworm. I don't know what disease it is and what medicine I should use.</p>
<p>Answer: Try applying "Miejue Jun." This medicine is a sacred product among skin disease treatments. It is effective in treating all kinds of skin diseases.</p>
<p>Profuse Leukorrhea</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Xu Fangren) Unfortunately, I contracted leukorrhea last summer and, due to an accident, did not receive thorough treatment, which affected my wife. Now she has profuse leukorrhea, even worse than before. Please recommend a good doctor and provide a treatment plan.</p>
<p>Answer: Dr. Liu Xuannv of Chunzai Hospital on Ningbo Road in the French Concession of Shanghai specializes in treating women's uterine diseases. You can go there for treatment. Also, treatment medications for this condition, such as internal use of "Miesha Lin," external use of "Lindu Shule'er," and injections of Mannal old spermatorrhea fluid seedlings, are all considered reasonable.</p>
<p>Frequent Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Li Yujin) I have always had stomach problems, which often cause abdominal pain. I have seen doctors and taken medicine, but they are only temporarily effective, and the pain recurs. I don't know how to treat it or what medicine is best to permanently eliminate this problem. Please advise.</p>
<p>Answer: You can take "Wei Bao," a preparation from Yaljiali, for stomach pain. However, you still need to continue taking it for a while after recovery. You must also avoid certain foods, such as alcohol, vinegar, spicy foods, and all other irritants.</p>
<p>Forgetfulness and Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Shen Shicao) I am a young student and have never had any illnesses before. Since last year, I have experienced nocturnal emission, three or four times a month, and severe forgetfulness. Please recommend a spiritual medicine to help me restore my health.</p>
<p>Answer: In addition to avoiding mental stimuli of lust, pay attention to taking nutritional products. For drug treatment, you can take "An'er Shen," which is a specialized preparation for treating sexual neurasthenia.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Committing Suicide out of Concern for the Country <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Tai</p>
<p>Committing suicide out of concern for the country is naturally something worth a passionate and tragic song. From the perspective of suicide itself, suicide is such a serious and sad thing. To willingly sacrifice oneself out of concern for the country is such a moving and admirable act. Such things seem worthy of worship and admiration. However, I say no, absolutely not.</p>
<p>Why? In China, many things have very pleasant names, but the reality is not so. Not only the suicide of Supervisor Du Yangzhi out of concern for the country, which is not worth mentioning, but even the sensational act of Xu Fanting cutting open his stomach to pay tribute to the mausoleum cannot be said to be the act of a hero. Because suicide is passive, it is boring. Even if one commits suicide, it cannot be said that the goal of concern for the country is fully achieved. It is truly a case of worrying for nothing and killing oneself for nothing.</p>
<p>If a person who commits suicide has such spirit and such courage, then there is much that can be done in the world. Since one is going to die anyway, one might as well do something sensational and die, which can benefit the country, leave a name for posterity, and stimulate the people's eyes and ears. How valuable is this? The ancients said, "Death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather," which is what is meant here.</p>
<p>People especially suffer from fear of death. If one is afraid of death, there is nothing that can be done. The heroes, brave men, famous generals, and outstanding figures in history, which of them did not get their titles from not being afraid of death? Therefore, not being afraid of death is originally the best thing, but there are reasons for not being afraid, and death has its price, so that one's death is not in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore, although I feel a kind of compassionate enthusiasm for the general public who commit suicide out of concern for the country, I absolutely cannot consider them to be ambitious and capable people.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Old Wandering Song <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>I worked at the Xinhua Fan-tan gambling den—its beautiful name is the Xinhua Club—for less than three months and it was over again. At first, I fully thought that from now on I could live a good life, but this beautiful, spring flower-like hope finally sank to the bottom of the sea without a sound, like throwing a stone into the vast ocean.</p>
<p>That night, there were a dozen of our buddies and forty or so gamblers in the detention center of the Fifth District Police Station. Everyone stared at each other blankly, you looking at me, I looking at you, it was really boring, and we couldn't even talk a little. Later, everyone leaned against each other and dozed off. We spent the night like this, and continued until the afternoon of the next day before we were released. The verdict was a large fine, which was paid by our boss.</p>
<p>I decided not to do this kind of thing again. I wasted a lot of days wandering around aimlessly. During those days, I joined their group—Blackie Chen, Tall Li, and Ah-Kei's organization—and partnered to peddle "Hundred Herbs Panacea Oil" on the streets.</p>
<p>Because I joined their group later, and the capital I paid was only three silver dollars. In fact, they were all Blackie Chen's ideas, and he only told me to take the flag with the words "Liu Bohui Hundred Herbs Panacea Oil" written in eight bowl-sized white characters, and carry the medicine box.</p>
<p>Every day, I wandered from the beginning of the street to the end, my feet were sore from running, my mouth was dry from shouting, and then I could eat those two bowls of plain rice. Although it was such an interesting business, haphazardly mixing several kinds of medicines together and saying that they were made from a hundred herbs, which could cure all kinds of diseases. The hundred kinds of herbs, even I couldn't figure out. —People sometimes need to deceive other people with fake things.</p>
<p>However, often in the quiet of the night, thinking of others and looking at myself, I would feel sad about an unfortunate thing that human power could not undo, looking at the vast sky with eyes that doubted everything in the world, cursing fate. The situation was just like a flock of crows returning to their nests, flying over the river and casting a dark and vast shadow, and my heart would become inexplicably dark.</p>
<p>Soon, my cousin found me a job as a gatekeeper in a middle school. Without hesitation, I left those three partners.</p>
<p>"Good fortune will not come to me."</p>
<p>I often thought like this when I was unhappy.</p>
<p>Really, in just five months, because I secretly took some students' money and let them go out to play, I was fired.</p>
<p>I was somewhat at a loss.</p>
<p>Nothing worked out, and the days passed one by one. What made me most anxious was the problem of eating. I couldn't not eat, and for this, I had done many dishonorable things. … Gradually, the days became a little hard to get through. At first, I struggled hard as if suffocating. One day after another passed, like a camel trudging through the gray journey in the desert, so hard that sometimes I couldn't even breathe. It was as if a rope was tied around my head, and when it loosened, I gasped painfully, and when it tightened, even…</p>
<p>(Life is a bad thing that respects the strong and bullies the weak!)</p>
<p>(Do you understand?)</p>
<p>Many relatives and friends, devout worshipers of life, would see you, this poor wretch, and secretly say in their hearts,</p>
<p>—Let's give him the cold shoulder, this kid doesn't bring anything good when he comes to the door.</p>
<p>Then, they would grumble and curse indirectly.</p>
<p>Even if my stomach was empty, it was difficult to freeload a meal. …</p>
<p>Because I was bored, I often went to the Pearl River to stroll around. Leaning on the railing, I could see the broad face of the Pearl River. The river water flowed as if it would never feel tired. When it was lively, it would sing softly little tunes that people didn't know; when it was silent, it would make people feel scared. It was like a sick old man, thinking that the message of death was coming soon.</p>
<p>Far away, the Haizhu Iron Bridge posed with the air of a noble and arrogant gentleman. Ships loaded with goods, people, shuttled back and forth. Some brought from the distant sky devils sucking the blood of this mysterious old country; others carried from old villages and towns batches of things that sold out the glory of their ancestors.</p>
<p>On the shore, high-rise buildings stood tall.</p>
<p>In the heart of the river, if one or two warships of unknown purpose stayed, there would be huge purple shadows, inverted in the water, and the shadows also liked to joke with the ripples on the water.</p>
<p>I loved to stare blankly at those things with my tired eyes. At the same time, I felt a shadow in my heart, gradually, gradually, expanding. I worried that this shadow would erode my fragile heart one day.</p>
<p>Such wandering was not entirely bad. Walking around the doorways of those cargo warehouses, I occasionally found a chance to be a temporary porter and earn enough to eat a meal.</p>
<p>However, day after day, wandering in the emotions of worry, resentment, emptiness, and depression, a person continued to live almost like a ghost.</p>
<p>—Tired, right?</p>
<p>If I could still feel happy, it would be when I had escaped it—this life guarded by the devil. Yes, no one cannot realize that every prisoner longs to escape from prison. …</p>
<p>This continued for another eight or nine months. —</p>
<p>Until later, when I received a letter from my uncle in the Yangloudong tea mountain, telling me to go to him immediately, I resolutely ended this "journey of life" and embarked on another new one.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Candy <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Returning from a friend's house, I passed a newly opened candy store. The tender green paint, illuminated by the dozens of extremely bright electric lights in the store, looked very harmonious and beautiful… I take this road home every day, but I can't remember whether this storefront was closed before or was another shop. Because it was newly opened, the store was crowded with customers, surging in and out in a disorganized way. Walking on the street, I only saw the clerks' heads moving back and forth above the customers' heads. At this time, a pedestrian in front of me suddenly stopped in front of the store, so I also stopped, and naturally others stopped behind me. Speaking of which, I have disliked eating candy since I was a child. Now I have teeth that can crack walnuts in one bite, which my mother says is because I don't eat candy. Today, I went to my friend's house to discuss an event that has a great relationship with my future. The result was a failure, but on the way home, I never forgot about this matter. I thought that perhaps my words were not sincere enough, or that I should use a roundabout method to move my friend's heart and make him help me complete this matter. Thinking like this, I felt very regretful and sad. Although I was not sure whether I could succeed by doing so, it seemed as if this matter had not been completed. I almost wanted to go back to my friend's house. While wandering alone, trying to find a solution, I just stopped in front of the candy store, and watching the person in front of me step into the store, I also stepped into the crowd as if drawn by him. Didn't I say that I never liked eating candy? I don't understand what I came in here to do? In the center of the store, there was a very beautiful tower, built from many different styles of cookies, adorned with small five-colored electric lights, but so many people were calling out to the clerks for something, not paying attention to the tower of lights. I admired this work of art like a connoisseur. I don't know if I looked like a pickpocket at that time. A clerk with a stiff collar and half of his white shirt sleeves rolled up ran up to me and asked what I wanted to buy. At this time, I really had no reason to refuse him, because many customers were crowding around him, asking him to wrap up some candy names that I was not familiar with, so I replied that I wanted to buy something. He led me to another counter, pointing to various beautiful boxes and plates inside the glass cabinet. These were all foods that I had never paid attention to before. Now, under the clerk's courteous service, I haphazardly pointed to this and that, asking him to wrap up a little. But when I wanted to ask him the price, he grabbed a lot of samples from inside, some pine nut candies, some coconut candies, some small individual pieces, some square pieces. I was surprised that I had learned so much knowledge about candy today, and asked him to wrap up a little of each kind, totaling more than three dollars. Carrying such a large bundle of things, I could not walk, so I called a rickshaw to go home.</p>
<p>My wife was waiting for me at the door. I had just noticed that the street lights at the entrance of the lane were already on. Because there were too many electric lights on in the candy store, I forgot that I had spent a lot of time there. Seeing me carrying a large bundle of things home, my wife took it with one hand. When she clearly saw the four characters "Tianlu Zihao" on the sign paper, she smiled innocently and asked me what I was so happy about that I bought so many talented candies. She seemed to realize that the matter discussed with my friend had achieved unexpected success, and called the child's name and ran upstairs. I paid the rickshaw fare and slowly went upstairs, feeling as if I had a dream, but that large bundle of candy was clearly being unwrapped by the child, one bag after another. I asked myself in my heart why I bought so much candy?</p>

A-Qiao, don't be sad, show some courage, take the two packages to Old Wang's place and wait for us. (Loudly) Open the door! (Wind and rain) Go, go!

<p>Unite! Everyone get up! Swear not to retreat! Save our survival! Resist our bad luck!</p>
<p>(Sound of many people, sound of water, sound of blocking the breach) The sound of living people being swept away by the water and shouting wildly! This place should be acted out realistically!</p>

<p>Wutong leaves fall, it's the beginning of autumn. Daiyu is, touched by the scenery, with a thousand feelings. I think, my delicate face is extremely thin. Often melancholic and sick, or often sleeping. Like the flowers and plants of summer. Their colors are no longer beautiful in autumn. I also think, the autumn moon is as cool as water. Makes people feel moved at first sight. Compared to, the Chang'e woman in the Guanghan Palace. She can't, escape the customs of love. Encountering, autumn rain that continues all night without clearing. A melancholy heart filled with hate. Complaining that, the rain master does not care about the autumn flowers. Day and night, the Phoenix Fairy is wet. More autumn wind like gold and iron. Destroying autumn wood, who pities it. Just like the autumn officer enforcing the law. Killing that, innocent beautiful woman too biased. Seeing that, the autumn geese fly high and far alone. Their cries are sad in the sky. Just because they heard the sound of the bowstring. Therefore, flying into the clouds to avoid losing their lives. Also see that, the autumn swallows return home quickly. Chattering farewell without lingering. Listening to that, the autumn insects chirping in the crowd. Like autumn rain sprinkling over the world. Seeing that, the autumn dew is like a pearl, easily extinguished. Like a bubble in water. Thinking that life is like morning dew. Turns into emptiness like dusk smoke. I see things hurt my heart and ache. Can't help but, jade chopsticks shed tears. More than the spring cuckoo cries.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The New 1936 Buick Automobile (Part 1) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Dan</p>
<p>The new 1936 Buick automobile is exquisite. Everyone who has seen it and ridden in it praises it unanimously.</p>
<p>Originally, its fame was not accidental. Because of its new silent straight-eight cylinder overhead valve engine, plus the unique "Annorite" pistons, it has extraordinary functions. Its strong power and convenient driving are also obvious. Its contribution to economy can be quickly proven. Other features, such as the "toe-tap" vacuum braking system, the Fisher "Turret Top" steel body, the enlarged space and increased comfort, as well as the sophisticated machinery and the beautiful interior and exterior, are all extraordinarily obvious. The above characteristics are all closely related to the riding public. I will talk about its main points in the following article.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, seeing is believing. Readers, if you want to know the benefits of Buick cars, it is best to actually ride in a Buick and let Buick itself demonstrate it to you personally. But even now, though it is armchair strategy, one can roughly outline its major points.</p>
<p>First, let's take a look at the entire Buick car, which is divided into four groups and fourteen models, suitable for all places and all walks of life.</p>
<p>Ninetieth Series "Limited" Model This Buick car is large and low, and extremely spacious. The width exceeds the height. During manufacturing, all previous dimensions were abandoned, and a new path was taken, sparing no effort to make its style and splendor take the lead in the automotive world for one year.</p>
<p>Eightieth Series "Roadmaster" Model With a gorgeous appearance and superior horsepower, it can be called a double masterpiece. No matter when or where, it runs smoothly and comfortably, without any bumps or vibrations. Calling it "Roadmaster" is truly living up to its name.</p>
<p>Sixtieth Series "Century" Model This Buick car has higher horsepower and speed than usual. It can only be compared to a whirlwind. Countless people in society are eagerly awaiting the appearance of this car. Now, without paying a high price, they can get a car with unparalleled horsepower and speed, while its exquisite style, beautiful appearance, and excellent quality are not inferior. It can be said that their wish has come true.</p>
<p>Fortieth Series Special Many car passengers often dream of buying a Buick car, but due to price concerns, they have not been able to fulfill their wish. There are also many people who, once they bought a Buick car, have been struggling financially in recent years due to environmental factors, making it impossible for them to keep it. Now their dreams can come true, because the Special Buick is very low in price, so even those who are not very wealthy can afford it. Moreover, its quality is still exactly the same as the higher-priced cars. All the characteristics of Buick are fully possessed by the Special Buick, and these characteristics are not found in other cars in the world.</p>
<p>The above are the four groups of new Buick cars. The streamline of each car, from the new narrow radiator grille to the rear bumper, extends in an unbroken line. Its horsepower and speed are unprecedented. Parking such a car in front of the mansion is truly impressive.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the car roof again, which is closely integrated with the body, like a seamless garment. This is the Fisher "Turret Top" style roof, made of seamless cold-drawn pure steel. Also, the chrome on the hood shines brightly, which is also a feature of Buick cars. Other features, such as chrome radiator trim, strong spoked wheels, wide foot pedals, and the trunk integrated with the body, are all special features. Everything in each car is pleasing to the eye and moving.</p>
<p>Inside the Buick car, the driving area is very spacious. The slanted seats are deeper and wider than before, and the headroom is extremely generous. Here, another change can be seen, that is, the brake lever has been moved from the usual place to under the partition, to the driver's left, which is the easiest place to reach. The space at the feet is therefore very generous.</p>
<p>The chrome instrument panel is also a lovely thing. The numbers on the speedometer and other gauges can be read at a glance, even when driving very fast. The instrument panel can also emit light directly or indirectly for night driving. A small red light on the partition lets you know whether the headlights are bright or dim. This convenience has also been long desired in the automotive world.</p>
<p>Before we talk about driving, let's take a look at the rear. The seats are wider, the headroom is higher, and the legroom is more generous. The rear seats are soft and comfortable, which is truly delightful. Its slope and shape have been carefully studied and are perfectly suited for rest. The cushions, lining, door handles, and other accessories are perfectly matched.</p>
<p>We have already looked at the interior, and now we are ready to drive. The engine is already running, but you can hardly hear its sound.</p>
<h3 id="e223">A Review of the US Trucking Industry Last Year <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Ya</p>
<p>Truck transportation has its own unique advantages, which have long been well known to users. As a result, freight trucks in the United States are among the most advanced and developed of all modes of transportation in terms of production and use. A look back at the production of freight trucks in the United States last year—1935—will make this particularly clear.</p>
<p>At the end of 1935, US automobile factories manufactured no fewer than 725,000 freight trucks in total. This number is an increase of 21 percent compared to 1934. As a result, the production volume in 1935 was the most developed of all years except for 1929, and it was only slightly different from 1929. The production volume from January to August 1935 was 535,041 vehicles.</p>
<p>In addition to domestic use and domestic market needs, US freight trucks also occupy a very important position in other markets. The number of vehicles exported from the United States to Europe, the Far East, Africa, and other regions each year is also considerable. Exports of freight trucks in 1935 increased by 21 percent compared to 1934. It is estimated that no fewer than 193,000 freight trucks were exported in 1935, accounting for one-quarter of the total production volume.</p>
<p>Why is the freight truck industry so developed? There is also a very important reason for this. According to research by government agencies, the following advantages have been discovered: Economy. The price of cars and gasoline in the United States are not very high, and a single truck can carry a lot of cargo. As a result, using freight trucks is cheaper than using other modes of transportation. Fast service. This is something everyone can agree on. The loading and transportation of goods by truck is always faster than by other means. Convenient delivery. The advantage of trucks over trains is in the convenience of delivery. Because train stations are often far from the city, goods cannot be delivered immediately upon arrival at the station. The situation with freight trucks is different. They can deliver goods directly to the recipient's door. This is its characteristic. Although freight trucks account for only one-eighth of the total number of registered vehicles in the United States, they pay one-quarter of the special vehicle tax. This shows the development of freight trucks.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, there are 48,000 villages and towns in the United States that do not have railroad service. As a result, all transportation relies entirely on automobiles. The population of these villages and towns accounts for 7 percent of the national population. As a result, in the past 25 years, their ability to connect with major urban areas has been entirely dependent on the great contribution of automobiles. There have been many proposals to increase the freight rates for freight trucks, but they have not been implemented. Several states, such as Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Delaware, and Maine, have implemented port-of-entry laws. Although various parties have strongly opposed them, they have remained ineffective. Transportation companies in particular believe that this approach is too illegal. Delaware also implemented this law in the same way because neighboring states implemented it. According to general opinion, this type of legislation is detrimental to the public because it invisibly adds an obstacle between states, like taxation between countries, and it also sees the vehicle license revenue donated by freight truck merchants as exploitation and unfair. Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Delaware have laws regulating the fees and services for freight trucks. The four western states have already changed their laws. The federal government has also promulgated laws to regulate the interstate freight truck industry, which have been in effect since October 1, 1935. However, many people believe that this law is somewhat different from the original intent. There are supporters and opponents.</p>

<p>Not long after the start of 1936, the US automobile industry also came with new hopes. But how the future will be is still difficult to predict at present, because the instability of the market is similar to the situation two years ago. What the car manufacturers are hoping for now is to get a reasonable return on their investment this year, which would be enough. In 1935, they spent a total of US$100,000,000 on various new components, which cannot be said to be a small amount. The so-called instability of the market has a wide scope. Among them, the development of the retail market is the most concerning for each factory. After the new cars came on the market last winter, the response from all parties was quite good, and the demand was very high. The salespersons of each company also took advantage of the momentum to widely promote sales. As a result, the number of units sold in six weeks was quite impressive. From then on, what the sales scene in the spring of 1936 will be has indeed become an important question. As for the huge amount of money invested by the automobile industry, people in the industry have no worries about it, because this kind of investment is different from consumption, and it is ultimately a permanent asset.</p>
<p>The use of car headlights is extremely important in driving, but drivers often ignore it, which is very strange. According to research by Mr. Philip Cadle, Chief Electrical Engineer of the Desso Automobile Company, after researching 3,200,000 cars, he found that among every ten cars, seven had defects in their headlights. Mr. Cadle also said that 55 percent of car accidents occur at night, and flashing lights and insufficient headlight brightness are major causes of accidents.</p>
<p>Mr. McCade, Manager of Nash Automobile Company, Mr. Brist, Deputy Manager and Director of Sales, and Mr. Connerson, General Sales Manager, conducted a large-scale business inspection at the end of the year and the beginning of spring. All major cities were visited by them. It is said that the impressions gained from this trip were very deep and very pleasant, saying that the future of the automobile industry in 1936 has a vigorous appearance.</p>
<p>The new streamlined Chrysler car has a new type of speedometer. This speedometer, in addition to recording the car's speed per hour in the same way as conventional speedometers, can also let the driver know the engine's speed of rotation. For example, the rotation rate of the third gear and the high-speed driving situation can be seen at a glance.</p>
