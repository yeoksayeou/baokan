<h3>法國議會選舉之意義</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>法國衆議院於上月二十六日改選因全國六一八選區中僅一八三區的侯選人以絕對多數的獲票當選故照章又於一屋期後卽本月三日舉行第二次選舉此决選舉中候選者只須獲得相對多數的投票卽可當選而在此一星期之猶豫期間比較接近的各黨又可以聯合或協定的方式使同一陣綫最有希望的候選者獲選故昨日再選結果至今晨大致當已有分曉吾人根據日來觀察預料在此决選舉中左派政黨聯合之人民陣綫當有大半勝利的把握</p>
<p>國際觀察者論及今年西班牙及法國的選舉以爲兩者均有重大的意義西班牙人民陣綫的勝利卽證明一九三四年十月喀泰隆事件後法西斯政府之不愜輿情而此决法國選舉中人民陣綫之堅固一致且獲得大部分選民之擁護可知法國的法西期勢力亦已到臨日暮窮途的境地在比較上西班牙選舉中民衆的勝利較法國的更爲顯著但就法國在歐洲的地位言則此决選舉影響的巨大實遠過於西班牙吾人試就此次法國選舉在內政外交上的影響分別加以論述</p>
<p>在法國內政上此决選舉的勝利顯示了人民陣綫各政黨團結合作的成功歐戰以來法國左右兩派政黨本已旗幟分明左派以正統派社會黨急進社會黨及共產黨爲中堅形成「左派卡太爾」或入民陣綫右派則以共和民主聯合黨及保守黨爲中堅構成「國民陣綫」但據過去的觀察急進社會黨雖勢力較大而它的政策的猶豫不能以顯明的政策取得民衆的堅决擁護實爲它幾决執政中的致命傷一九二四及一九三二年選舉中急進社會黨及其與黨兩决獲勝而結果都不能長久支持就是由於這個緣故但在最近的選舉中左派各黨堅守人民陣綫的綱領以擁護民主政治反法西斯提高人民生活程度及努力國際和平爲號召在選舉中絕無猶豫之態度果能獲取民衆之信任得到最後勝利今後在法國內政的動向上民衆的力量必將有更顯明的表現</p>
<p>在歐洲國際外交上此决法國選舉所發生的影響爲集體安全制度的更增鞏固人民陣綫的勝利表示法國民衆對於法蘇互助協定已加以堅確的擁護火十字團領袖洛克曾表示法德應有聯合造成法西斯國家之同盟賴伐爾亦倡言德法必須合作以建立歐洲永久和平的基礎此種表示卽爲反對法蘇協定而發但法國民衆明知希特勒的步步進迫對於歐洲和平實未有眞正的誠意而法蘇協定的訂立却爲支持歐洲和平的重要支柱所以這决選舉結果對於歐洲安全和平的影響也是極大的</p>

<h3>德國的備戰（下）</h3>
<p>— Louis　Fischer　賓符譯</p>
<p>希特勒元首在一九三五年五月二十一日又作了一次和平演說。最近我所碰到的德國人，個個都拿這决演說當做德國外交政策的基礎。這决演稅含有着兩個目的，其一就是討英國的友好。三星期後英德海軍協定果然簽訂了。希特勒是頗需要這個的，五月廿一日的演說就是對道的懇求。第二個目的則爲對布爾雪維克俄國的仇視。希特勒自己劇烈地於肆地攻擊莫斯科，但第二天德政府却授給蘇聯政府一筆一萬萬馬克的長期借欵。德國需要着蘇聯的原料—油，錳，木材，等等—想使她停滯的工廠開工。雖然莫斯科儘知道商業利益和政治同情應該劃開，她可終於沒有接受這個提議。</p>
<p>對於這次演詞，我們在這裏不能再作詳盡的分析，總之柏林常反　引申着。牠根本的論據就是國社主義對集體安全制的反對。希特勒說，「當錯綜的國際義務的交織，减少了戰爭局部化的可能時，像第一次大戰這樣的慘劇便很易發生，而把許多國家曳入一决戰爭的危險也愈見其大了」。怎樣纔能使戰爭局部化呢？很簡單的。希特勒提議說，「當這樣的戰爭爆發時，別的國家應立刻從兩方面退出，不要讓自己受條的義務的束縛，自始即擲入漩渦中一。具體地說，就是一日德國進攻捷克或奧地利或立陶宛時，別的國家，那受條的規定援助被侵略者的國家，應當立刻站在中立的地位而　德國跟立陶宛或德國跟捷克他們自己去交戰。於是，讓我們假定說，希特勒呑食了第一塊肉，再向着匃牙利或南斯拉夫去進展。這時候，別的國家仍舊不去干涉它，務使德國跟它孤單敵人間的戰爭局部化。如果有人眞的相信希特勒所說德國决不是侵略者的這種遁辭，那纔可笑呢。我們姑且說，蘇聯攻入了波蘭。結果假定是波蘭屈服了。那蓄意侵略的莫斯科第二也許就會攻擊德國的，那末，如果趁俄國打敗波蘭之後，各鄰國大家起來集體地對付她，以剷除她方萌的野心，不正是對於德國有利嗎？這樣如果不是爲了阻止將來戰爭時對德聯合陣綫的形成，更有什麼堅决對集體安全制的理由呢？我問遍我所碰到的德國人，都不能解答出來。我想這是不會有解答的。希特勒在一九三五年五月二十一日的演說，還證明着一種恐怖，就是德國已爲它目已保留了將來戰爭時的勢力範圍。其　是奧大利。希特勒言說他要奧大利「自决」。一個德國高綫官吏會對我說，德國不久將在奧大利舉行投票，以斷定奧大利情願歸併德國與吾。德國曾拒絕擠保奧大利的領土完整。第二是立陶宛。希特勒在五月二十五日那天說：我們凖備跟我們所有的鄰國訂立互不侵犯條的，只除了立陶宛。」但希特勒又說倘若立陶宛能够遵守保陣德國少數民族權利的米美爾法令，這例外便可取消。總之這是一個複雜的問題，解决尙需很長的時期。而且立陶宛還是進攻蘇聯邊境的階梯呢。</p>
<p>現在反蘇聯運動在德國極爲流行。在他最近與法大使銀賽（Francois　Pcncet）的會見中，希特勒曾費很多的時間攻擊蘇聯。在去年十二月十三日與英大使斐普斯（Sir　Fric　Phipps的三小時談話中，希特勒化了更久的時候抨擊蘇聯。幾星期以前，希特勒曾對　。盔團的團員演說。他主要的　村就是反蘇維埃主義。親俄的論調是不能在德國報上發表的。爲侵略蘇聯的思想和智識的掩護，正在積極進行中，有人認爲這是危險的，因爲他回想到德國在一九一四——八年大戰中的失敗，正是由於德皇不採用俾斯麥的親俄政策，但希特勒置之不理。那凖備不但是思想的。一個見解完全與我不同的美國人，最近在倫教也對我這樣說，他雖沒有證據，但他確信德日同盟已粹締成而且是針對蘇聯的。德國正在訓練着日本軍用機的駕駛員。去年十二月，有二十六個德國航空專家從意大利跑到日本去。日本出席海會代表在去倫敦途中曾與戈林逗留了二天。其他的證據是不勝枚舉了。</p>
<p>但是也許德國在一九三八年　不預備戰爭，因此目前不至有立刻的變動，這可是錯誤而危險的觀念。到了一九三七或一九三八或一九三九年，德國必不至處於單獨與各强匹敵的地位。如果德國在日本或波蘭或匃牙利找到了帮手，那日期也許要提早了。還有一層，那對德的假想聯合陣綫愈脆弱，大戰的慘鍋也就愈迫近。許多德國人都以爲英國因有意大利和遠東的牽制以及惟恐倫數受空軍襲擊的顧慮，除非受到直接的威脅，一定會站到下屆戰爭的圈外的。英國是否將爲奧大利，爲捷克，爲立陶宛也像爲阿比西尼亞而鬥爭呢？歐洲文化的命運，大概就靠這點來回答了。</p>
<p>因此，一切都在乎德國能獲得的　人的多家，以及能消除的假想敵人範圍的大小。現階段德國外交的最顯著的目標，就是把法國從俄國，法國從英國，以及俄國從英國分開。同時牠又竭力緊緊的拉攏倫敦，以爲中立的預備。但前此最重要的目標，也須視德國對意大利政策而定。一個衰弱了的意大利可使德國在奧大利較易挿足。就另一方面講，因爲同是不滿　狀者，意大利在下次大戰中也許是一個帮手。然而意大利也能袒法以對德的。意大利在阿比西尼亞的失敗，將必繼以墨沙里尼的坍台，這對於德國法西斯主義，無論在國內或國外，部是不利的。這種失收，如果再受國聯集體行動的加速，將必成爲後繼的侵略者一個可怕的「的車之鑑一·因此，德國是懷了希望，恐怖和猶疑，觀望着意阿事件。牠不想以言辭或行動　怒英國；世却也不願疏遠了意大利。這樣的「中立就是德國所指為他們和平主義的明證。他們正等着看風向呢。</p>
<p>意大利征阿所造成的最緊張時期並不曾與德國所造成的最緊張時期併合，這是歐洲的莫大幸運。要不然，這兩個國家竟是聯合起來，歐洲便將成一團糟了。歐洲的政治家都感到在德國問題成熟以前，必須先解决英意阿的鬥爭。事雖聯盟，却也困難。</p>

<h3>化學科講演之一　中等學校化學的教學（中）</h3>
<p>— 國立編譯館專任編譯陳可忠</p>
<p>關於編書的缺點和困難，我們有兩種補救的方法：第一從前的課稈標準只有大綱，沒有細目，伸縮的餘地很大，所以編出來的書，雖然表面看來，各項節目與課程標凖無大出入，但程度的深淺和取材的詳略，同樣的書可以有很大的　異。所以現在擬加上一個細目來補救。這種細目大的在暑假前，就可以公布的。第二關於審査敎科書，此　政府將採極嚴厲的辦法，以淘汰不良的敎本。政府　於審查敎科書，素來都很愼重辦理，每一種敎科書反復審查修正，至少在二三次以上，有　一本書籍的錯誤，竟達到二三百處之多。我們所以要這樣不憚繁瑣，替編書的人修改補　，其最大的目的，是希望能够多出幾部比較優良的敎本，而且新課程標凖公布未久，各種敎科書爲數不多，爲了適應目前各學校的急需，所以對於敎科書的審定辦法，過上是比　的寬容。現在出版的敎科書，旣是一天一天的增多，而且有些化學教科書的編輯，似乎有每况愈下之概，所以我們於敎科磁的審查，採取嚴厲的辦法，是一植必然的演，也可以說，是一針見血的補救辦法。</p>
<p>眞正講起米，編輯中等敎科書不是一件容易的事，非專學化學的人所編的化學敎本，我們姑且不諭。就拿專門化學的人　講罷：對於中學敎學有經騐的人，他編出來的書，雖然比較適合於學生的程度，但是對於新的材料，總覺有點隔膜。至於大學化學敎授或同等學力的人所編的書，對於新的化學書展情形，黨然十分明瞭，但是對於敎材深淺詳略的分配，却和中等學校的情形，不能十分啣接，所以要編一部像化學這種科學的好的敎科書，就非下面的兩種人不可：第一是對於中學化學敎學法有相當硏究的大學化　敎授；第二是能時常參閱新材料的中學化學敎員。除開這兩種人而外，所編的敎科書總難免有「隔靴搔癢的毛病。所以要想有比較好的敎科書出版，我們只有希望這兩種人才多多的努力。</p>
<p>關於學校的設備，現在亦有一個補救的方法。從前有好幾省的學校當局，亦知道中等理科設備的缺點，總想自動的充實起來，但是凶爲不知道應該充實到甚麽地步，要用多少經費，所以很難着手。最近敎育部頒布中等學校設備標準，把一切應用的儀器同價目都詳細列出來，所以各省敎育當局可以根據這種標準預先籌欵，而學校當局對於增加預算，也有一定的標準可循。我想在短期內，中等學校的化學設備，大致可以希望提　。</p>
<p>關於敎員方面，現在我們亦有補救的辦法。敎員從前最大的毛病，在沒有淮修的機會。敎育部去年前年曾經通令中央，中山，北平，北京，北平師範等十六個大學舉辦中等理科敎昌暑期訓練班，擔任訓　班的敎員，都是大學裏面的中要敎授，訓練的範圍，除了介紹各科新材料外，對於中等學校敎學方法，當然也討論到的。有了這種暑期學校的辦法，以後敎員可以每年得到新的化學智識，同時對於本身的敎學與趣，也可比較濃厚一些。</p>
<p>關於標準的隨時變動，現在敎靑當局也知道不是辦法，所以最近關於化學課程標準的改訂，僅將　習時間稍爲减輕，實騐時間稍爲增多，但對於標凖的內容，並沒有多大改動。現在中等學校以下各種學校的課程標凖，旣已漸次完成，我們相信以後這　標凖絕不至於時常變動的。</p>
<p>上面所講的各點，對於學生化學程度的好壞，自然都有密切的關係，但是最大的責任，還是在學生本身，因爲假使學生不知道學化學的方法或許不努力，就是有適用的謀本，良好的敎員，和充分的設備，也都沒有用，所以學生對於學習化學的熊度和方法，是應該特別注意的。現在分別提出幾點來講一講：</p>
<p>關於學習化學的方法，第一我以爲中學生對於化學重要事實和原理應當有深切的認識。雖然有許多人講：一個人讀書只是呆板的記憶是不對的，但是我們對於很基本的原理和很重要的事實，那就非記熟不可，丙爲各種定律和原理，都是具有普遍性的，一經了解和純熟的記憶，就可用來推斷其他的各種事理。定律和原理好像是一條絲綫，能够把很多的事實，有系統有組織的連接起來，若是沒有定律和原理，一切事實使都成了散沙，所以我們對於定律和原理的了解和熟記是必需的。其决關於化學的各種重要事實，有兩方面也應常特別注意的：第一凡是互相有連帶關係的事實，第二凡是同我們日常生活有關係的事物，我們都應該留心體騐的。</p>
<p>第二對於化學上重要名詞或術語的意義，我們應當有深切的了解。古語說得好一名不正則言不順」，在化學方面，亦是如此。如果我們對於化學術　的定義，都弄不淸楚，那末我們對於這些千頭萬緒紛然雜陳的化學現象，就難有明確的概念了。例如「氣化」是化學上極普通的術語，假如對於這個名詞的意義都弄不淸楚，那末我們對於極重要的化學現象像燃燒呼吸等等，當然都不會了解。所以學化學的人，對於一切化學名詞的意養必需注意的。</p>

<h3>蔣委員長在湘訓詞　軍訓之目的與救國的基礎</h3>
<p>一、救國必先救民救民必先以身作則剷除自私自利之病根</p>
<p>二、軍人讀訓十條即軍人救國之精神基礎</p>
<p>三、希望湘人發揚曾胡輩「忠誠撲拙」之精神作革命之中流砥柱完成復興民族之使命</p>
<p>長沙通訊、蔣委員長四月二十八日召集長沙各校學生訓話、題為「軍訓之目的與救國的基礎、」原詞如後、</p>
<p>「何主席·各位同志·今天本委員長到軍訓總隊來巡視、藉此機會、要將我們軍訓的目的與救國的道理、對各位說一說、</p>
<p>大家都知道現在我們國家已經到了危急存亡的地步、各學生要到軍訓總隊來受訓練的目的、就是要救國、我們要救轉國家達到軍訓的目的、就先要知道國家是什麼、以及我們的國家為什麼要被人家侵略壓迫、弄到現在這樣危急存亡的地步、正如一個人要醫病、一定要先知道病源、否則頭病醫頭、脚病醫脚、甚至病急亂投醫、必然吃藥愈多、愈難見效、乃至最後要喪失生命、所以我們要救國、一定要知道國家的病根所在、然後能對症下藥、起死回生、大家要知道國家是什麼、國家的根本要素就是人民、國家就是有人民共同的精神和意志的積體、古人說、「民為邦本、」總理說、「國者人之積也、」就是說國家就是由人民集結而成、人民就是國家的根本、因此我們要救國、就先要救民、要醫國家的病根、就先要醫好人民的病根、所謂人民的病根、并不是指普通身體方面的病痛、也不是指少數人特殊的精神病、而是指一般國民在精神和人格方面為整個國家民族興亡所關之根本的毛病、這個毛病是什麼、簡單的說、就是中國人從前最大的老毛病、「自私自利、」現在一般人都是存著「各人自掃門前雪」的態度、只知有個人、只求自己的飽暖安樂、再不顧到旁的人的福利、和一般同胞的痛苦、更不知道有國家的恥辱、因此對於別人、對於一般的同胞、都不知道相親相愛互助合作、甚至看見自己的同胞、受苦遭難、也毫無同情惻隱之心、不知道自己應當要竭盡所能去援救他、譬如在路上看見人家挑担挑不起、推車推不動、甚或沉溺在水裏、或病倒在地下、他都是袖手旁觀、漠不關心、不知道同胞之間、有互助與援救的義務、不知道凡是中華民國的國民、都是黃帝的子孫、都是我們自己的同胞手足、見人有任何苦難的時候、我們有一分力量、就要盡一分力量去援助他、總要視人飢溺如已飢溺、救人危難如救已危難、而且要進一步本著克已愛人的精神、做到古人所說「公爾忘私國爾忘家」這兩句話、才算是一個眞正的現代國民、我們的祖先、就是因為能夠發揚這種美德、所以國家民族、能夠臻於文明強盛、歷久不衰、到現在因為一般人失掉這種固有的美德、不能親愛互助、所以不能團結精神、集中力量、所以雖有四萬萬同胞、而人各自私自利、不相顧愛、便如一盤散沙、大家試想、我們四萬萬人如果眞是同心同德、團結一致、如同一個大鐵球、這個力量多大、國家那裏還有不能救轉的道理、反之、如果仍舊各人自私自利、始終不能團結愛國、如同一盤散沙、那有什麼力量、這樣一盤散沙的國家、安得不一天比一天貧弱、安得不被外國人來侵略壓迫、最後到滅亡為止、所以大家要知道我們雖有廣沃的土地、豐富的物產、優眾的人民、雖有悠久光榮的歷史文化、如果大家仍舊自私自利、沒有國家民族的觀念與互助、合羣的精神、國家終不可救、現在我們國家、到了如此危急存亡、我們的同胞、受到如此的慘傷痛苦、如果我們再不能剷除一切自私自利的心理和習慣、及時奮發、努力圖強、那末、將來國家亡了、我們自己和子子孫孫、都要做人家的奴隸牛馬、如此、我們何以上對祖先父母、下對一般同胞和我們後代的子孫、這一段話、是我們從此以後、要救國必先要剷除自私自利、希望各位要切實了解這個道理、其次、各位更要曉得現在這個時候、正是我們大家發奮有為成功立業最好的機會、古人說、時勢造英雄、現在的中國、正是造英雄的時勢、如此貧弱危難的國家、如此恥深痛極的民族、將來由我們手裏挽救過來、復興起來、這是何等光榮偉大的事業、尤其是湖南各位同志、要特別以救亡復興之大責、毅然引為已任、古人說、楚雖三戶、亡秦必楚、我相信湖南人的確有此精神和魄力、遠的且不必說、即就最近百年以來的事實講、如同曾國藩胡林翼一般人、因為他們所處的時代環境不同、且不必對於他們因衛道護敎而效忠清室一點、有何評論、單說當時國家的情形、以及他們所表現的精神和所作的事業而論、是值得我們欽佩的、尤其是可以為我們湖南各位同志效法的當時一方面有太平天國的內憂、揚子江流域各省、幾乎完全失陷、一方面又有英法諸國的外患壓迫侵略、時時危急、當時如此紛亂危險的國家、就是因為你們湖南曾國藩·胡林翼·左宗棠·這幾位豪傑、幾位先賢、能夠乘時奮起、發奮為雄、就將大局挽救起來、使一般同胞的痛苦、能夠解除、當時珠江和長江流域各省、差不多都已失陷、只有你們湖南獨能保全、并且以湖南為中堅、作根據、卒能挽救大局、使國家轉危為安、這幾位先賢、就是我們救國的模範、今天本委員長對各位同志講話、心裏就是期望大家要以曾胡的精神為法、負起當前挽救國家復興民族的重大責任、要以你們的湖南為中流之砥柱、要你們一般青年學生、作復興民族的賢豪、我們可以相信、只要大家能夠立定大志、明德修身、發奮圖強、沒有什麼危難不能打破、沒有什麼國家不能救轉、曾胡幾位先生、能在當時那樣艱難的環境、做出一番事業、依時代進化的道理來講、我們將來的功業、不僅不讓於曾胡、而且比他們的成功、更要偉大幾倍不止、</p>
<p>關於國家的危難和病根所在、以及我們所應負救國的責任、我已經講明、但是我們如果僅僅明白這個道理、而沒有眞實的精神來做救國的基礎、無論有怎樣的大本領、仍舊不能救國、即如曾胡一般先賢、他們當時救國的基本精神、就是要提倡中國固有的首先、就是孔孟之道、其所倡導的就是一種「忠誠樸拙」的人格、大家知道、曾胡都不過一介書生、一切都很平凡、原來沒有多大的本領、就是首先文章、當時與他們相埒的人也很多、何以曾胡幾位先生、能夠出來矯正人心、轉移風氣、而成就撥亂反正救國救民的一番功業、最要緊的一點、就是他們能以忠信誠實樸拙（即實在）的精神、以身作則的倡導天下、以此敎其學生、敎其子弟、敎出來的共同一致努力救國、所以能將這樣危亡的國家、還能救轉來、因此、可知救國不難、只要恢復我們祖先固有的首先、無論什麼國難、皆可使之轉危為安、而且可使之轉弱為強、現在我們有兩千多個學生、集合在此受訓、大家志同道合、互相勉勵、時代之進步、與機會之良好、比曾胡當時的情形、至少要好過幾十倍、只要我們眞能發揚我們總理革命的精神、提高我們固有道德、一定可以挽救國家、一定可以復興民族、我們現在救國的基礎是甚麼、我剛才已經說明、現在我們國家危難至此的病根、就是自私自利、因此可知我們救國的精神、就是在自私自利的反面、古人說的「損已利人」一句格言、這話的意思、就是說我們要革命、就要犧牲自己來為國為民、最近中央所頒布的軍人讀訓十條、就是基於這個救國精神所訂的訓練、就是我們軍人學生和一般同志救國救民的基礎、現在我先將讀訓十條朗讀、給大家聽第一條、實行三民主義、捍衛國家、不容有違背怠忽之行為、</p>
<p>第二條、擁護國民政府、服從長官、不容有虛偽背離之行為、</p>
<p>第三條、敬愛袍澤、保護人民、不容有倨傲粗暴之行為、</p>
<p>第四條、盡忠職守、奉行命令、不容有延誤怯懦之行為、</p>
<p>第五條、嚴守紀律、勇敢果决、不容有廢馳敷衍之行為、</p>
<p>第六條、團結精神、協同一致、不容有散漫推諉之行為、</p>
<p>第七條、負責知恥、崇尙武德、不容有汚辱貪鄙之行為、</p>
<p>第八條、刻苦耐勞、節儉樸實、不容有奢侈浮滑之行為、</p>
<p>第九條、注重禮節、整肅儀容、不容有　蕩浪漫之行為、</p>
<p>第十條、誠心修身、篤守信義、不容有卑劣詐偽之行為、</p>
<p>剛才我已說明中國人一般的病根、是有私自利、惟其自私自利知自己、只、不顧別人、所以做作種種卑劣欺詐虛偽的行為、因為自私自利、不顧社會的風紀、所以有　蕩浪漫的行為、雖喪身亡國而不自悟、惟其自私自利、所以奢侈·怠惰·貪鄙·怯懦·散漫、不負責任、不明禮義、不知廉恥、不守紀律、不學武藝、因此不能團結精神、集中力量、不能刻苦耐勞、節儉樸實、不能盡忠職守、奉行命令、不能敬愛袍澤、保護人民、不能實行主義、捍衛國家、這些就是從前一般軍人的毛病、軍人是現在的國民、現在的青年、所以軍人的毛病、也可以說就是一般國民一般青年的毛病、我們一般青年、旣要立志救國、就要先從本身起、切實剷除軍人讀訓中所不容許的一切不良的行為、從此以後、要實行你本身的三民主義、要擁護你自己的國民政府、服從你長官、敬愛你袍澤、保護你民眾、要嚴守紀律、要勇敢果决、更要盡忠職守、要奉行命令、要團結精神、協同一致、要負責知恥、崇尙武德、要刻苦耐功、節儉樸實、要注重禮節、整肅儀容、總之要誠心修身、篤守信義、要統一意志、團結精神、實行三民主義、來達到救國救民的目的、我們必須以此自勉勉人、切實做到、才能做現代的國民、才能發揚曾胡諸先賢精神、如此、我們所處時代環境之優異將來所成就的功業、一定比曾胡更要偉大、更要光榮、今天到場的各位同志、今後如果能照曾胡的精神做去、那末、你們湖南從前只有一個曾文正、現在有了幾千的曾文正、如此、你們的力量、何等強大、什麼國難、都可以由你們打破、什麼國家、亦可以由你們救轉、如此才不愧為黃帝子孫、不愧為中華民國的國民、亦不愧為我們軍訓團的學生、</p>
<p>今天本委員長以此勉勵我們軍訓各青年學生、並以此勉勵湖南各位同志同胞、希望大家在何主席領導之下、團結精神、協同一致、相親相愛、奮勉努力、大家更要立定志向、保重身體、鍜煉精神、自強不息、造成救國的基礎、完成革命的使命、（中央社）</p>

<h3>兩浙鹽區　視察團擬就整理計劃</h3>
<p>杭州通訊、財政部鹽務稽核總所所派之整理兩浙鹽視察設計團·團長曾仰豐·團員楊興勤·黃柏棠·吳尙志·孫邦藻·及兩浙稽核所幫辦唐榮滔·稅警局長張中立·工程師鍾鎤等一行八人、月前赴各鹽場視察、周歷浙東各屬二十三處、極為澈底、日昨返杭、在兩浙稽核分所舉行會議、由該團團長曾仰豐將視察情形·及整理意見、分別報告討論、茲錄其槪要如下、</p>
<p>鹽場管理之困難　浙省海岸綿互五百零五公里、鹽場星羅棋佈、異常散漫、全區共分二十三場、每場又分五六段以至數十段不等、故產鹽之地、實有數百處之多、每處產量、雖不甚豐、若不加管理、則私鹽透漏、亦不在少數、按現在情形估計、兩浙私鹽每年可達一百餘萬擔、蓋兩浙與長蘆淮北完全不同、蘆淮各區產鹽雖每年各有六七百萬擔、但鹽場集中、管理較易、而兩浙則產鹽年僅四百餘萬擔、以產區有數百處之多、故管理非常困難、如以完備之建設、則需欵至鉅、此實地勢使然、兩浙不能與蘆淮各區相提並論者也、顧自民國二年稽核所成立以還、兩浙鹽務亦未始無顯著之進步、考民一該區稅收年僅二百餘萬元、放鹽數僅六十餘萬擔、經稽核所漸次整頓後、稅收放鹽兩項、年有增加、迨民國二十年、稅收已達九百餘萬元、放鹽數亦有三百五十萬擔、近二年來稅收放鹽兩項、雖稍形短絀、要亦有其種種之原因、民國二十三年改行市秤、鹽價驟增、加之是年浙省大旱、鹽產奇旺、農村破產、人民購買力弱、因之私銷充斥、此種情形、固不獨兩浙為然、即蘆魯各區、亦復如是、由此可知、鹽場散漫之地、土鹽充斥之區、鹽價不宜過高、否則不特不能獲增收之效、即原有之稅收、恐亦難以維持也、</p>
<p>稅則之不均　兩浙鹽稅隨則、極其輕重不一、有十餘種之多、考輕稅之由來、原為養成近場人民食用官鹽之習慣起見、是以距場愈近、稅率愈輕、用意固非不善、惟稅則旣不平均、以輕侵重、自屬難免、若以稅警武力攫、則緝私經費、勢須增加、結果處處設防、防多力薄、得不償失、且輕稅鹽斤、多為不肖商販運銷重稅區域、藉圖厚利、民眾又須按照官定牌價付值、絲毫未能享受輕稅之利益、徒使國家稅收無形中損失甚鉅、鹽務管理上亦增加許多困難、觀此、可知欲養成近場人民食用官鹽之習慣、僅施行輕稅、殊難收效、根本辦法、仍在於管理場產與平衡稅則之二事也、</p>
<p>人員辦事之情形　目下各重要秤放機關、如溫台餘姚定海南沙等處之主管人員、大都潔身自好、幹練有為、惟低級人員、稍欠振作、至稅警方面、視蘆淮各區固有遜色、然較從前緝私營時代、已有進境、各種陋習、均已革除、但當地錄用之官佐、以缺乏經騐、殊鮮良好之成績、故整理兩浙鹽務、對於人事上、亦不能不加以相當之注意、</p>

<h3>繆鍾秀談　赴日考察生絲檢政經過</h3>
<p>我國將於七月一日實施檢騐</p>
<p>實業部上海商品檢騐局技正繆鍾秀、上月奉部令赴日、考察生絲檢騐情形、爲吾國實施生絲品級檢騐之參考、業已返國、據談此决考察所得之印象如决、</p>
<h3>各國　檢驗經過</h3>
<p>生絲檢騐、分分量與品質兩項、分量一項、各國均已採行公量制、早無問題、惟品質一項、則自四十年前、經歐洲生絲產銷各國規定施行以後、日美兩方、詳加研究、將檢騐方法與機械逐步改善、並各發明較爲完善之方法、但各持己意、不易融洽、故於一九二八年、日美開第一决生絲檢騐會議於橫濱、一九二九年、舉行第二次會議於紐的、經兩决討論後、雙方對於檢騐方法之意見、始漸接近、至生絲分級問題、亦各持理論、美國主張、各級品質、須以最低限度爲標準、日方則以平均數爲標準、乃各制定等級、並規定各級品質、日本遂於一九三二年一月、强迫實施品級檢騐、凡輸出生絲、須經政府檢查所檢騐品質、詳定等級、生絲貿易、卽以檢查所評定之等級爲依據、絲廠及出口商不得過問、此爲各國生絲品級檢騐討論之經過、及日本實施品級檢騐之情形也、吾國生絲貿易、積弊甚多、最要者、卽出口商檢騐生絲之標則、往往因絲價上下而轉移、如交貨時之絲價、較訂約時爲高、則檢騐必寬、反之則嚴、優劣無定、爭執時起、以上兩弊、後者廠家受損、前者則劣貨充塞國外市塲、華絲信譽、爲之墮落、此種情形、日本在未强迫實施品級檢騐前、亦復如是、自品級檢騐由政府機關執行後、前述積弊、立卽廓淸、蓋生絲經分定等級、又規定品質標準、則各國銷用生絲者、得就其需要、指定品級訂購、不必經自己檢騐、而始知其所購貨物之品質也、吾國實施生絲品級檢騐、於華絲外銷、有莫大之利益、蓋將來國外購用華絲者、必先取得吾國品級證書、方肯收受貨物、則華絲輸至國外市塲、優劣分明、經營輸出者、無法上下其手、華絲令譽、卽可維繫不墮、國外購買華絲、旣覺便利、更有保障、自亦樂於採辦、華絲外銷、因是必暢、且吾國生絲外銷、直接競爭者、厥爲日絲、日本政府鑒於品級檢騐之重要、早已明令强迫實施、此决本人在橫濱、與出口商晤談時、僉謂、日本政府施行此項政策、最初雖戚困難、但自去年七月以來、國內外貿易均感便利、日本政府、已收有良好效果、吾國自應急起直追、採行同樣政策、</p>
<h3>日本　政策收效</h3>
<p>日本在一九三二年開始品級檢騐時、所訂生絲分級及各級品質標凖、較美國生絲分級之規定爲寬、加之檢騐人員、技術未精、因是日本檢定之品級百分之七十、與美國檢騐之結果、不甚符合、日本絲市遂異常紊亂、經營生絲出口業者、以檢定品級、權在政府、而合格與吾、責在商人、無不戚覺困難、迨去年六月間、始將品質標準、重加規定、從前僅注重總平均數、今將總平均數一律提高、同時最低分數一併注重、此外並增品質檢騐數項、一切辦法、較美國分級專重最低分數之規定、更爲嚴密、檢騐手續、亦較前完備、自經嚴格整理後、日絲輸美、十之八九、均照日本檢查所評定之等級接受、日美生絲貿易、國內外均極便利、蓋日本已收實施品級檢騐之效矣、考其收效之由、不外分級規定之嚴格、檢騐方法之新穎、旨在以縝密之品級檢騐、促國內生產者之努力改進、吾國已定七月一日實施生絲品級檢騐、開辦時能卽取嚴格、使適合國外市塲需要、則信用必著、效果必宏、日本往事、可爲明證、是在政府與絲商同抱决心而已、</p>

<h3>桐油專家談　增進桐油外銷計劃</h3>
<p>改良產製運銷增進國際信譽</p>
<p>從事直接貿易鞏固國外市塲</p>
<p>申時社云、桐油爲我國之特產、年來外銷極旺、自去年起、常佔我國出口貨之首位、本年更形活躍、此在我對外貿易中、固屬可樂觀之現象、惟考其輸出突興之原因、純爲國外一時需要之激增、而非我國桐油已具推廣銷塲之能力、且國外竭力提倡植桐、故我國桐油之前途、尙難樂觀、申時社記者昨特走訪某專家、詢欲維持桐油輸出、永久繁榮之計劃、承吿各情如决、</p>
<p>暢銷國外有三原因</p>
<p>記者首詢桐油出口旺盛之原因、據答、本年全桐油輪出、較去年更爲活躍、一二兩月出口總數、共達一千四百餘萬元、其出口之盛、實爲近年所罕見、考我國桐油出口增加、的有下列數端、　美國爲我國桐油之最大銷塲、平均每年輸入、的達一萬二千萬磅、經濟恐慌發生後、减至七八千萬磅、近年以來、因實行復與經濟計劃、頗具成效、各種工業、漸趨復興、桐油需耍、漸復常態、故我國桐油銷量、驟然增加、佔出口全數十分之八、　自去年以來、第二次世界大戰之恐怖口號、深入人心、世界各國備戰之狂、一如大戰之前夕、而大戰之爆發、確已日趨尖銳化、如去年十月意阿戰爭之發生、今年三月七日德軍之進兵萊茵區、卽其導火錢、世界戰雲密佈、將來地中海必將封鎖、戰需品之輸入、難免有阻隔之虞、歐洲各國、爲未雨綢繆計、莫不儲備原料、桐油爲重要原料之一、故我國桐油之對外貿易、備受各國歡迎、　至桐油飛漲之原因、因桐油係內地出產、運銷頗費周折、一旦需要激增、市塲存貨吿罄、而不能源源供給、其價上漲勢所必然也、</p>
<p>產銷方法亟應改良</p>
<p>綜上所述、可見我國桐油輪出盛旺之原因、實爲海外需要量之激增、而其價格之所以增漲、則由我國桐油之供不應求、但此種現象、僅爲一時需要供不應求之結果、而非我國桐油在海外市塲、獲有推廣銷路之能力、自難視爲常態發展、故我人如欲維持桐油外銷永久之繁榮、對桐油之產銷、須加以根本之改良、　我國桐油之培植方法、極不講究、榨戶收買後、復隨意貯藏、不免發生腐爛、榨油方法、亦墨守舊法、不知改良、故品質欠佳、色彩深淺不均、夾雜物未能去凈、油脚過重、酸性太高、故榨油率極低、全國產油量、每年損失、爲數至堪驚入、　運銷手續極煩、間有商人混摻雜油、以圖厚利、品質因以變劣、影響對外信譽、故實部規定凡桐油出口、須經商品檢騐局檢騐品質、檢騐合格後、方准出口、藉此可增進對外貿易之信譽、已定七月一日起、舉行强迫檢騐、　裝運方法不佳、運費高昻、且時生阻隔、往往不能按時交貨、故市塲有供不應求之虞、　桐油外銷、純操洋行之手、國內旣無直接經營桐油出口之機關、油商復不能聯絡、致市塲及市價、純爲外人所操縱、爲求鞏固國外市塲計、上列四點、須加以改進、</p>
<p>世界市塲不難獨占</p>
<p>並謂桐油爲我國特產之一、在國際市塲中、帶有獨占之性質、若能利用時機、急起從事改良、建立國際間之信譽、則前途甚爲光明、改良途徑、最主要者厥在於產製運銷、在生產方面、首應集中我國桐油、由政府匡助、以從事於大規模之種植、如此、則科學方法可以引用、品種可以齊一、生產量可以計算、產量自能增加、在製造方面、榨油應採用新法、俾效率增高、同時復須注意於精煉與分別油之等級、確定各等級之標準、在運輸方面、應研究經濟裝運方法、運輸機關、亦應設法减低運費、及實行負責運輸、以達經濟便捷之目的、至於貿易方面、根本要圖、在於集中出口、苟國內桐油商人、能團結一致、以共同力量、爲大規模之出口組織、則我國國外桐油市塲、自能日臻鞏固、</p>
<p>美國竭力提倡植桐</p>
<p>又謂桐油外銷、以美國爲最大市塲、而美現竭力從事提倡植桐、最近成績頗爲可觀、散植於福老利達·喬其亞·阿拉巴馬·格西安那·密西西比·及帖克散州者、的有六萬英畝、桐樹旣多、發育亦佳、並設有兩大桐油廠、將來發展必甚迅速、我國桐油旣以美爲外銷惟一對象、自宜設法改進、吾則在美銷路、勢必衰微、前途將受重大影響云、</p>

<h3>上海之保險業（績）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之二十三）</p>
<p>三，華商保險業之特質</p>
<p>華商保險業，其勢力雖不能與洋商相頡頏，然已樹立相當基礎，對於挽回利權，保持國力，實具相當功能，所引爲憾事者，卽各公司資本究嫌短拙，爲喊輕責任，平均保險起見，與洋商公司，常訂有分保契的，故事實上仍與外商保險行有密切之關係，每年巨額營業，仍簡接與外人共享，此爲今日華商保險業第一特質。</p>
<p>今日華商保險業，一方面固仍與外商有密切關係，而其另一方面則又爲金融界資本之副業，蓋各華商保險行，類多爲金融界所投資，而其主要人員，亦多係有關係之金融界人員兼任，此爲今日華商保險業之第二特質。</p>
<p>四，上海保險業之權威者—史丹—</p>
<p>吾人欲了解今日上海保險業之近况，實不能不一知上海保險業之權威者史丹S　arr　C.Y.　氏之略歷。史丹氏美國人，昔在美國加利福尼省執行律師事務後因律務不振，旋卽停業一九一七年歐戰突發，乃服軍役，戰後來滬，創辦美亞保險代理行，代理美國保險公會管理下之大美洲及新大陸等保險公司之事務，營業雖頗發達，然因賠欵過多，終與美國保險公會脫離。旋由美國全球聯邦等公司，委爲駐華代理人，史氏始能舒其手腕，拉攏有力買辦，並聯合本埠中外金融家創辦美亞，慘淡經營，不遺餘力，不數年間獲利甚鉅，乃組織友邦銀行及友邦人壽保險公司，並改美亞保險代理行爲公司，並在市塲發行股票，依照保險業常理而論，保險代理商之性質，不能興保險公司相提並論，史氏以一保險代理商，發鉅量股票，其魄力手腕，實足稱許，嗣爲發展營業計，又與法人SigantE、組織法商法美保險公司，以謀在安南方面佔一席地，更與英人施美士合作，在香港註冊，組織英商四海保險公司，以圖獲得香港方面之營業，此外在華商經營之泰山保險公司，亦有投資，史氏以美亞爲中心，在滬握保險業之樞紐，其勢力之雄厚，在業中首屈一指</p>
<p>五，上海保險業之前途</p>
<p>上海保險業自創始以來，蓬蓬勃勃至今已盛極一時，近雖因市面衰落，工商凋頹，不免亦稍受打擊，但資金集中都市，一時未能內流，地產事業，已成過去，公價，標金兩大市塲，最近亦漸趨冷落，則今後將其過剩資金，投之於保險業，殆爲不可避免之事實，但今日之保險業，亦與銀行業遇一同樣之難關，蓋過去保險業所收之鉅額保費，大多投之於地產，證券。今則時移勢遷，此項資金，將如何運用，實爲今日保險業所最當考慮之問題。</p>
<p>自中央信託局，設立保險部後，政府之物產皆投保於信託局，最近復有政府將統制保險業之傳聞，目前固尙未能加以證實，但値此各業皆厲行統制之時，前途如何，未易言也。</p>
<p>最近水火險之實收保費，因同業競爭甚烈，日趨低落，華洋各公司以獲利較難，乃訂立保險經紀人登記及佣金限制之辦法，以期减少佣金，提高保費，此實關係數千保險經紀人之嚴重問題，聞經紀人方面，亦已組織公會，對於華洋兩公會所訂辦法，有所表示云。</p>
<p>補充　一，前述華商保險公司項下，寳豐·泰山兩公司，雖有外人附股，但華商股份，佔絕對多數，且均在中國政府註冊，由華人經理，故賞爲純粹華商經營性質。</p>
<p>二，北美洲保險公司華經理，除朱言斌君外尙有吳光甫，鄭學坊，蔡鶴卿，孫文卿，王問梅，黃定良六君。</p>
<p>更正前述寳豐保險公司項下，謂「資本雖小，營業極佳，」被手民誤排爲「資本雖小，營業極淡」，合亟更正。（完）</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （陳熙）</p>
<p>在春之夜裏，與友人逛馬路去，走過一家廣東菜館，便走進去找小吃。緣絨的玻璃裏面，嵌着一張應時菜單，上面寫道：「杏元補腦汁·淮元猪手湯·麻姑鳳爪羹……」我眞莫名其妙，後來問了問堂倌，纔知道「杏元補腦汁」就是猪腦子的別號，「淮元猪手湯」便是蹄筋湯的化名；但是頂刮刮的廣東人，爲甚末不寫原有的名稱呢？這，聰明的國人都知道，因爲不加上這些文字藝術的雕琢，便不能算風雅，誇大，所以三家村裏的小飯館中，也有東坡肉供人大嚼。記得美國布克女士，在伊的「大地」小說裏面，描寫中國藥店有一味藥，呌做「龍骨」，不過買來一看，却是塊「狗骨」，伊就懷疑中國藥的虛僞。其實，伊這種懷疑，顯然是不懂咱們的風雅。</p>
<h3>麪魚</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>麪魚是長江下游，近淞口一帶的特產水產品，在吳淞口，產得最多。這種魚的體長，的三吋，有十歲左右的小孩子的手指那磨粗。全身作半透明的銀白色，所以一名銀魚。但上海人，却都呼之曰「麪長魚一。全身僅具一根細長的脊骨，但極脆嫩，並無哽喉之虞。把魚首，帶頸一折，便可很便利地，把魚腸抽出。此外，全身　都是鮮美肥嫩的可食之肉了。</p>
<p>據民間的傳說，麪魚是野史上有名的萬里尋夫的范喜良夫人孟姜女女士，因不從秦始皇卑劣的誘姦手段，觸怒了始皇帝，給剎成了肉泥，傾在江心中，貞魂不散，而化爲麪魚的。還有一說，是廢曆二月初八日，不見經傳的那位張大帝，千秋華誕，下了整整幾大鍋的麪，因一時吃不盡，於是便整鍋兒的去傾棄在他所坐鎭着的吳淞口。仙家的東西，多少總得帶些仙氣的，因此，麪條兒都變成了麪魚了。還有一說，是八仙之一呂道爺，在張大帝處，祝壽歸來，駕着趁脚風，行經江陰左右時，酒性發作，連酒帶麪，都嘔在長江岸上。恰巧濟顚和尙，也從張府中出來，應着好耍子，於是把手一指，口念六字眞言，便把一堆骯髒不堪的麪條兒，指化成了無數的麪魚。還有一說，是二月二十八日，帶着大批棺木旅行的老和尙，正在過江時，忽覺身上奇癢。伸手一抓，竟是一把老白虱。於是斷手一撂，便撂在江中，而化成了麪魚。所以在廢曆三月初，麪魚便上市了。</p>
<p>這些，都不過是齊東野語而已，自然是不値一笑的。雖然關於麪魚的考據，尙無相當的書籟，可資參考，但道是東海中的魚產，隨着浪潮而湧入吳淞口的，是毫無可疑的。我人若是在產麪魚的春季中，往吳淞去玩耍時，恰値潮漲的時刻，便不難見大隊的漁舟，在海面上活動着，撈捕　魚。麪魚這東西，在海中，是十數尾，以至數十尾，互相啣着尾兒游泳的，因此，很快的，漁人們，便能捕得半艙兒，售在吳淞鎮上的魚行裏，再零售給的顧客。遊客若是有興，儘可買幾斤回去，和蛋製成麪魚餅，和筍片製成麪魚湯，或用他法泡製，其味鮮美，自然是盡在不言中。</p>
<h3>葱與蒜</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>舊友黃君，由華北來函，述及葱蒜大小，南北不同，轉錄如下，以吿未赴華北之諸同胞。</p>
<p>葱蒜在食品中，有添香助色之功，故國人大都嗜之。惟南人呼蒜必冠一大字，曰「大蒜」，呼葱則吾，北人則呼葱必冠一大字，曰「大葱」，呼蒜則吾，此乃余素習聞，每疑大者係小之對立名詞，旣有所謂大，必另有所謂小者在。最近余因旅食華北，見市售之葱，幾粗如兒臂，皆獨棵而無駢枝，長一尺三四寸，管葉絕少，製餚時棄其葉而取其梗，味極香美。其最粗者，二三棵即重一斤，與南產之葱叢生而細如韭葉者逈異，乃悟北人呼葱必冠以大字之故，所以別於南產之小葱也。繼余又注意及蒜，則北產之蒜頭，粒僅如桂圓，試剝之，內含細瓣十五六，較大之辦，亦不過粗如荳芽，最小者竟細如米粒，與南產之蒜瓣均肥如拇指者逈異。於是余又悟南人呼蒜必冠以大字之故，所以別於北產之小蒜也！</p>
<h3>黃花麥果</h3>
<p>— 馬佛生</p>
<p>「黃花麥果」這是一個多麼動聽的名詞啊！我相信也不用問吃過黃花麥果的人滋味怎樣？恐怕即使不曾吃過黃花麥果的人只要聽到黃花麥果的名字，也會垂涎三尺的啊！</p>
<p>黃花麥果並不是一種植物的果實；而是用一種野菜（黃花嫩）和米粉所製成的米糕。「黃花麥果」對於它雖然是一個名不副裨名詞，可是它那清香的氣味，柔韌細膩的糕肉，和翡翠碧綠的糕色，恐怕眞不負這「黃花麥果」的美名啊！</p>
<p>在我的故鄉——紹興鄉下現在正是很盛行吃這個黃花麥果的季候，而且差不多每一個人都嗜愛它；所以我們那裏有這樣的一首歌謠：「黃花麥果韌結結，關得大門自要吃；半塊拿弗出，一塊自耍吃。」可見對它的嗜愛愛了。但是黃花麥果是一種非賣品；你非自己親手去採製，是不能嘗到美味的。</p>
<p>我在小時候是常吃到母親親製的黃花麥果的；那時常常要使我們兄弟爭吃得打起架來。現在又到了吃黃花麥果的時候了；我想起故鄉的黃花麥果，同時又使我懷念起逝去了人世的母親；反而引起我的感傷來。唉！我還能吃到母親手製的黃花麥果嗎？</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　品茗作淸談夜窗聽雨　折枝　艷影花卷流芳</p>
<p>平山走進房，看到書桌上，已是把筆硯安排好了，這就笑道：我這來得不是時候，你正要作文章，我就來打攪了。國器笑道：我又沒有什麼人限制我那天交卷，今夜寫可以，明夜後夜再寫，也未嘗不可以。雨夜無聊，我也正想找一件事來消遺，你來了，我們坐着談談，那正是好不過。平山是個二十多歲的人，穿了一件呢皮袍，襯了他圓臉大眼，濃厚的頭髮，却形容得他是個豪爽而叉忠厚的人。他因爲國器說了，並不急於寫文章，所以他一點不躊躇，就坐在那書桌子邊的圍椅上。他看到那維納絲的石膏像。便笑道：你這書桌上，古色古香，怎麼雜這樣一位希臘女神，帶了歐化氣味。國器斟了一杯茶，送到他而前；笑道：寒夜客來茶當酒，你先乾一杯，我再說罷。平山眞個喝了那杯茶。國器道：難道希臘神話上的人物，還不算古嗎？平山道：古自然是古。但是作這個神像的物質，是石膏，未免近代化了。國器這却沒有了話說，在他對面一張椅子上，微笑的坐下。平山道：我應得。據說，這個維納絲，旣是司管美麗之神，又是司管愛情之神，你現在這枯燥的生活裏頭，是需要這樣一個女神，來帮你的忙的。不過道個女神，自已就不宰，被迫着嫁了一位惡神。他自己管着愛情，自己的愛情，就掌持不住。你想把你的命運，付託給他嗎？國器笑道：那倒不是我縱然迷信，也不至於鬧這種洋迷信。我覺得這位女神，很有點詩意，所以我就放在桌上。中西的神話，對於女神，總不會那樣美滿的，像我國的織女嫦娥，那全不是婚烟不美滿的人嗎？平山笑道：雖然如此，究不應當把這種薄福的女神，供在案頭。因爲你正是靑春活躍着的時候，應當供一位月老在桌上，讓他好好的給你選擇一位淑女。國器搖搖頭道：你還提到這個呢，剛才家母還提到這一層，我就覺得現在談不到。且不談什麼室家之累，是我們不願負擔的。就是我們理想中那樣一個美麗而又愛好文藥的女子，那裏找去？縱然是有，他爲什麼要嫁我這樣一個窮措大。所以在自己這一方面說，同在人那一方面說，我要娶親，却不是一件容易的事。平由向他臉上看着，見他穿的布袍子，是一點皺紋也沒有。就是兩隻袖口　也不帶一點汚穢的墨　。（一六）</p>
<h3>香椿頭</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>南貨店的櫃檯上，在隱身招牌之前，所陳列着的幾個盤中，總是盛放着鹹蘆筍，靑頭鹹　蔔乾，黑的鹹大頭菜等東西，而同時，總也陳列着一盤靑黑色的鹹香椿頭。鹹香椿頭，是一種過粥的妙品，在鹹澀之味中，也含有相當的鮮味。若在酒醉飯飽之餘，再添上半盌稀粥，而用鹹香樁頭過着，頗能體味到別具的滋味。瞬即春去夏來，天氣一天熱似一天，用鹹香樁頭過茶淘飯，不只鮮爽適口，同時，也怕比了吃大魚大肉，來得較適於陽胃的消納。我鄉頗盛行把鹹香椿頭，切成了細末，拌入和着醬油，蔴油，辣油等的豆腐中，用以佐膳，佐酒的吃法，味兒也實在不錯。</p>
<p>不拘是甚磨鹹貨，自然，都是用鮮貨加鹽製成的如鹹肉，鹹魚，鹹蛋，鹹菜之類。鹹香椿頭，不能例外的，自然也是用鮮香樁頭，加鹽製成的。不過鮮香椿頭，不像鹹香椿頭，流行得那磨普遍，所以認識鮮香樁頭，或是嘗過滋味的，怕的是並不多吧。</p>
<p>鮮香椿頭，是木本的椿樹，所茁出的校葉，完全是贛紅色的。待到校老了一些，便逐漸地變成靑色了。所以摘香樁頭的，最遲待嫩枝長上三寸左右，將近變靑時，便得摘下來了。在這鮮香椿頭中，含有一種奇異的香味，愈嫩的，其味愈濃。因爲鮮香椿頭，茁出枝頭時，總是鮮竹筍，從地下透出來的季節，所以鮮竹筍與鮮香椿頭，合煮着嫩豆腐，（鮮香椿頭，須後入，以防香味的因高熱而减退），可說是暮春中的唯一富有田園風味的佳餚，鄙意直可與鮮魚相並列。在竹筍炒蛋中，加入些鮮香樁頭屑，其味也頗不惡。若是在煮熱的猪油中，和入鮮香椿頭屑，而凝結起來，那更可久儲不壞。雖然到了秋間，還可以鮮香椿頭的菜餚享客；好不够味。</p>
<p>鮮香椿頭，在上海的各小菜場間，是難得有出售的。物以稀爲貴，所以其價値，是很昂貴的或許比了時鮮枸杞頭，還貴些。而同時，還有一種與鮮香椿頭，形狀色澤，完全相同，但沒有香味的一種鮮嫩樹枝，混充鮮香椿頭出售，所以在購買時，須眼到鼻到，庶不致誤。</p>
<h3>黃河鯉</h3>
<p>— 景仁芳</p>
<p>黃河的唯一出產，就是名聞遐邇自古著稱的「黃河鯉。」黃河鯉的成名還有一件奇事，相傳在宋代時候，河南洛陽「門口」地方，（是大禹治水所鑿的）地勢生得非常峻險，兩巖對峙，那時黃河流域適常其衝，籠門口有巨石，突出在水面，鯉魚遊到，因爲阻止不能前進，便一躍而過，至今依然是這樣的，而「鯉魚跳龍門」一句話，後人却傳爲佳話了。河南開封因爲毘連黃河流域，運輪很　利，所以黃河鯉的價格並不十分昂貴，一般平民階級，多能一嚐其味。於至黃河鯉品類最好，肉味最鮮嫩的產地，便是河南省陝州到蘭封銅瓦廂一帶的算最好，鱗甲金躍，味鮮肉細，早已臉炙人口了。</p>
<p>黃河鯉的出市季節，可說是日無間斷的，一，年三百六十天，天天都有上市，就是在嚴寒冰凍的日子，無從捕捉，而魚市也不斷銷售。這因爲漁民在深秋時，努力打捕，銷售所餘，便都養入池中，以護水法不使結冰，每天早晨投給啖餌虫等飼魚東西，這樣魚的生長，和在河流裏生活差不多了。一到冬季，漁民們便鎖售市上，但價格却每斤活鯉非三叫角左右不可，而死鯉也非二角左右買不動呢。</p>
<p>上海各河南帮酒菜館，也都有「黃河鯉」出售，而且都是活潑鮮跳的，但是價格很貴，每尾稍大的要二三元。它的運輸方法，更是要費不少週折，先由魚商把黃河鯉裝入一種特製的魚池水箱，交由隴海鐵路運到徐州，轉津浦鐵路到上海路程再過江換京滬鐵路到上海路程的莫要兩週夜，而魚部依然能夠維持生命，自然是因爲保護得法啊！</p>
<p>黃河鯉的烹調方法很多，現在把作者所知道的約略寫幾則下來：</p>
<p>糖醋溜製法　先把活的黃河鯉摔斃，以沸水滌除污垢，放入沸油釜中，到差不多要成熟時，再加糖，醋糝和成糊法，潑置魚身上，味甜而酸。</p>
<p>紅燒製法先把活鯉摔斃，用沸水滌去污垢，放入沸油釜中，到成熟的時候，用元肉湯，紹酒和鹽醬等物和糝，潑上魚身，味鮮湯肥，味道很不錯</p>
<p>醬汁製法　入釜煮法同前，到成熟時，拿最上好醬，酒，和葱白和糝，潑置釜中，少時即成，味若糟蝦，甚爲適口。淸蒸製法先將活鯉摔斃，以沸水條去汚垢，納入蒸範裹，套在釜上烈火隔水蒸，到快將成熟時，以葱塊香薑汁和香醋糝合，潑置魚身，味口鮮辣稍帶有刺激性的。</p>
<h3>紅繡鞋</h3>
<p>— 奚堪</p>
<p>我們家鄉最近死了一位陸姓的老太太，伊是擁有四千餘畝田地的大地主，在平時生活的優越，名譽的傳播，那都不用說了。在臨殯的那天，我也因爲家庭的關係，跑去送葬，從許多弔客口中，却談起這位老太太臨死的遺囑來。</p>
<p>在伊快臨終的時候，將家中大小人口都時到跟前，於含淚要作永別的當兒，命兩個媳婦將牀頭的皮箱打開；子女們疑爲老太太收着什麼寳貴或銀錢，爭着去看，那知却是滿箱沒後跟的三寸紅繡鞋，那老太太强打精神望着紅繡鞋說：</p>
<p>「我從十七歲到了你們家中，二十一歲老太爺就死了，家族中想謀我這份財產，弄出好多是非，可是我靠着你們倆，」伊又望望兩個五十多歲的兒子：「那時你們才二三歲呢，我於是就决心守寡一，守寡的苦處是怎樣呢，你們看這箱紅繡鞋，」伊又低頭望着箱內，「這幾百雙的沒後跟的紅繡鞋，都是我在夜中睡不着時，允其是五更頭在牀上來去搓揉和蓆子磨壞的！我今年七十六歲了，」伊又像感慨似的說，「親戚鄰里那個不說我有福有壽，可是我從二十一歲到四十五歲的二十幾年中，心裏的苦處，有誰人知道呢！」伊又頓一頓，「以後你們要孝順我的，我姓陸的門內，不論媳婦或女兒，在丈夫死後决不要伊們守寡，快快改嫁，你們要記住我的話！」說完就死了。</p>
<p>我們從陸太太的遺囑中，很可看出貞操問題的眞面目來，守節是違反人們的意志，是猙獰的，是吃人的，我們不需要什磨宏文大著來證明這紅繡鞋的故事，我希望社會柱石們，也跟陸老太太學學，以自己的經歷和苦痛，喚醒後人，不要一誤再誤下去。</p>

<h3>中法台杯雙打戰　林寶華最精彩</h3>

<p>（哈瓦斯社三日巴黎電）中法兩國綱球隊台羅斯盃、歐洲帶初賽、第三場單打、係由中國隊許承基與法國隊特斯脫勒摩比賽、許承基頃以一對三失敗、比數如次、</p>
<p>（哈瓦斯社三日巴黎電）中法兩國綱球隊台維斯盃歐洲帶初賽、第四場單打、係鄭兆佳對蒲塞斯、結果鄭兆佳以直落三失敗、比數如次、</p>
<p>（哈瓦斯社二日巴黎電）中法兩國綱球隊、頃於本日午後三時三十分、舉行台維斯盃雙打比賽、結果法　隊以六—一、六—三、四—六、六—二、之比數、擊敗中國隊、兩日合計已以三對〇淘汰中國隊、而得複賽之權、茲將比賽情形記下、</p>
<p>第一盤</p>
<p>第一盤、法國隊當以六比一獲勝、開賽時、天氣清朗、觀眾不下兩千人、法國隊聯絡極佳、得心應手、連勝三局、至第四局乃由中國隊林寶華發球、球出如飛、法國隊選手竟為之束手、林許二人遂在熱烈鼓掌聲中、獲勝第四局、其時雙方比數為三比一、至第五局、乃改由法國隊鮑羅脫拉發球、其落點多與界綫相近、打法極為準確、貝爾那配搭亦佳、大有相得益彰之妙、於是又連勝三局而以六比一結束第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤</p>
<p>第一·二、三局林寶華·貝爾那·許承基、先後發球、各負一局、法國隊即以二—一佔先、迨鮑羅脫拉發球、轉勝一局、法國隊乃以三—一佔先、嗣由林寶華發球、奪回一局、貝爾那發球負一局、乃為三對三、是時中國隊至為活躍、比賽情形、極為緊張、觀眾咸為之興奮、不幸中國隊嗣後一蹶不振、連負三局、第二盤遂為法國所勝、</p>
<p>第三盤</p>
<p>法國最初以二—〇佔先、惟第三局、鮑羅脫拉發球失誤、第四局許承基發球獲勝、遂為二—二平手、嗣貝爾那發球、又勝一局、為三對二、第六局中林寶華精彩迭出、造成三—三、中國隊嗣又連下一局、而以四—三佔稱、觀眾均被鼓掌讚美、惟第八局許承基發球、為法國隊所勝、又為四—四平手、至是中國隊合作嫻熱、無懈可擊、連下兩局、而以六—四勝第三盤、</p>
<p>第四盤</p>
<p>迨休息十分鐘後、兩隊重復登塲、法國隊連勝三局、林寶華扳回一局、鮑羅脫拉發球、亦負一局、為三—二、其後林寶華雖迭有精彩表演、但勝利卒為法國所得、比賽時間、共歷一小時三十分鐘、據各綱球專家證券、林寶華球術極佳、惜乎許承基相形見拙、否則歐洲各國對中國綱球隊、大足刮目相看也、</p>

<h3>美國承兌票據市塲之鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 劉孔鈞</p>
<p>銀行承兌票據市塲之在美國，爲輓近之新發展。在一九一三年聯邦凖備條例通過以前，國立銀行不得經營承兌匯票業務：所有少數之承兌票據信甩，乃若干州銀行姣大投貲銀行及私立銀行所創造者。凖備條例制定人深知銀行票據爲投賣貿易之唯一方法，而擴充承兌票據市塲，足以增加銀行制度之力量與伸縮性，　該條例授擅會員銀行經營承兌票據，惟受聯邦準備部各種規章之限制。該條例父規定承兌票據，得以按照必要原則，向聯邦準備銀行貼現，凖備銀行並得在公共市塲，買賣合格之承兌票據。</p>
<p>承兌票攘爲一種專門業務，其發展之迂緩，自爲世人所置信。但在一九一七年終，美國一未兌付之承兌票據，已有四億五千萬美元之多。而因銀行與商人對於承兌信用技術上漸有相當之認識，及聯邦準備條例之採寬大主義，迨一九二九年終，承兌票據數量遂增至十七億三千二百萬美元之最高峯。厥後數年，受商業不　氣，物價慘跌，與國際貿易减退之影響，未兌付承兌票據數量，逐漸收縮，至一九三四年十二月抄，其總數僅達五億四千三百三十八萬五千美元。承兌票據市塲發展之情形，可於下表說明之：</p>
<p>銀行承兌票據未兌付數額表（單位千美元）</p>
<p>銀行承兌票據，原爲投資商品移動或貯藏之用，聯邦準備條例最初允許會員銀行承兌票據，以投資進出口貨，旋經修正，遂包括他種交易在內。下表所列一九二六年及一九二九年年終與一九三四年八月三十一日之未兌付承兌票據數，乃就其效用分類者。</p>
<p>年來投姿進出口貨之承兌票據，佔美國未兌付票據之大部分。此等票據，以其含有自能淸償Selfqlinidating性質，多以健全穩固目之。所有投姿國內輸運貨物之票據，以其代表眞正銷售，亦多受同樣看待也。</p>
<p>未兌付銀行承兌票據類別表（單位千美元）</p>
<p>銀行承兌票據之用於投資貯存外國之貨物，或外國間彼此輸送之貨物，其數額增加極速，一九三〇年終，此項承兌信用之未兌付額共爲五六一，四四二，〇〇〇美元，其在一九二六年終則爲四〇，三一三，〇〇〇美元。世人皆知紐的居國際金融中心之重耍地位，對於投資國際買易及外國之內部交易，義不容辭。但非有嚴格標準，則其實施易生流弊，而危及出票人及承兌人，嘗有大宗承兌信用，因德國務停頓契的German　Standslill　agreements而發生之凝滯，足以昭示此種投資之含有危險性</p>
<p>他種主耍承兌信用，爲承兌信用之以倉庫主要產物（國內倉庫信用）爲根據者，近年來商業不景氣，此項未兌付承兌票據額之减少，常不如他種之甚，蓋以倉庫內貨物，在輸運出售之前，用爲投資之依據，不能不認爲穩　之方法，所可慮者，用之不善，適足以長其投機之風耳。</p>
<p>承兌票據之用以創造美元滙兌，此爲美國之特色，乃出口貨含有季節性之國家，如中南美等國，在輸出稀少時期，用爲創造美元餘　之主要工具也。出票人負到期償付承兌票據於承兌銀行之義務，惟該欵係取諸輸出旺盛時期出售貨物於美國所得之貨價，而因此項承兌票據不以實際輸送貨物爲根據，聯邦準備部乃制定種種條例，以限制會員銀行之活動。</p>
<p>承兌票據出場之　成要素有三，即承兌機關票據商人與購買人是也。</p>
<p>聯邦凖備制度下之會員銀行，爲票據承兌機關之最重要者。聯邦準備條例授權會員銀行創造承兌票據不超過其已繳姿本與盈餘之半數，但得聯邦凖備部之許可，會員銀行亦可創造承兌票據相當於其姿本與盈餘之全數。此外按照聯邦凖備部規定之條例，並可承兌創造美元滙兌之票據，相當於其資本之半數。除會員銀行外，尙有多數私家銀行外國銀行與外國銀行之美國代理店，從事於承兌票據之創造。</p>
<p>十五年來美國承兌票據業務集中於少數紐的主要金融機關之手，其决則爲東部各大都市之金融機關。當聯邦準備制度創立之初，多數銀行被其吸引以經營承兌票據業務。一九一八年至一九二一年間，共有五百機關，報吿承兌負債之數，其中亦有在內地小城市者。厥後因其承兌數額不足以爲維持必要便利之保證，乃相率放棄兼營，一九三四年八月三十一日，報吿承兌負債者僅有一百十二機開。承兌票據業務之地理上集中於紐的，可以是日承兌票據未兌付數額百分之八十爲紐的聯邦準備區域所創造之事實證明之。</p>
<p>茲將從事於創造承兌票據之機關分別種類如左</p>
<p>報吿承兌票據之銀行類別表（一九三四年八月三十一日）　　國立銀行　五九</p>
<p>信託公司與州銀行　三三　　私人銀行　九</p>
<p>外國銀行　一</p>
<p>外國銀行之美國代理店　一〇　　總計　一一二</p>
<p>票據商人，乃在金融市塲經營居間人業務之私家銀行與金融商店所構成，其所經營大都爲證券及承兌票據，亦有自爲商業票據之經紀人，及投放抵押放欵與聯邦資金之媒介者；大多數設立於紐的，經營大宗承兌票據之商業共有十家左右。</p>
<p>票據商人之職務，爲自出票人承兌機關或其他持票人手中購入票據　分配之於投資家。票據商人對於購主，每日發寄淸單，詳列承兌票據之日期·單位·號數·及所開之利率。票據商人直接購入票據，而以較高價出售，博得利益，售價常較購價高百分一之八分一至四分一。其售於聯邦準備銀行之票據，須加背簽，但售於其他購主，若非特別　求，不加背簽。有票據商人背簽之票攘？其利率常較低，票據商人對於上等信譽銀行所背簽之合格票據，普通開價，多爲一律，惟間有不合格及不著名銀行背簽之票據，則其所開之價恒較高也。</p>
<p>銀行承兌票據之主要購主，爲商業銀行聯邦準備銀行，其决則爲儲蓄銀行保險公司，及其他金融機關。票據之按照聯邦準備銀行條例發行者，普通常視爲最安全　流動之短期信用工具，商業銀行並得以承兌票據爲其次要準備，儲蓄銀行與保險公司之投資銀行承兌票據，且得多數州政府立法上之認可焉。</p>
<p>聯邦準備銀行爲承兌票據市場之主要分子，不僅以公定價格自行購買票據，亦且代理外國往來店購買票據，及與票據商人成立再購買契的，訂　票據商人在十五日內重行購入所售出之要據。準備銀行之在淸理期間購買票據，足以穩定市場，又可以减少票據商人保存財產之危險程度。通常準備銀行購入承兌票據，係在銀行票據商人或其他持票人保有該票數星期之後。其由票據人購入之票據，的佔票據總數三分之一至分之一，其餘則爲由銀行購入者。若將再購買契的購人之票據除外，則其由銀行購人之票，的佔總數叫分之三。</p>
<p>準備銀行自行購買票據，僅爲被動作用。蓋賻入票據之一部或全啊，係按照公定價格辦理，並不在市場開價購買，或將所保存之票據出售也。然由此所擴充之準備信用，常　準備當局之嚴密監督，較之貼現爲　甚。因所定之購價　若低於市塲票據利率，可以吸收大宗票據之供給；及之，購價高於市場利率，則票據之供給减少；票據到期，而準備銀行之票據保存額，將隨以减少矣。</p>
<p>他方面準備銀行代理外國　來　購買票據，常爲承兌票據山場中之自動出價者。準備銀行爲謀迅速完成外國中央銀行所委託之使命，其所出之價，常較本身所購之價高百分一之八分一；又其所加票據之背簽手續　亦爲百分一之八分一。是項票據大部分係直接向票據商人購人，其對於市場之過去影響至大。準備銀行代外國往來店所保存之票據，有多至未兌付票據總額三分之一者。近年來以貨幣情形之混亂，外國中央銀行之購買票據，漸趨减退，一九三叫年秋凖備銀行代理外國往來店保存之票據數不及一百萬美元。</p>
<p>準備銀行旣爲承兌票據之絕大驟主，其購價在在影饗公共市場，自無待言。通常紐的九十天期票之公共市場利率，與凖備銀行利率相較，或相同，或稍高，但此種關係，常爲準備銀行購買政策及他方面之需要所左右。若準備銀行不能自由購買，則應提高市場利率，以獎勵其他購主之需要，倘銀行需要票攘甚殷，則市場利率低至凖備銀行利率之下矣。</p>
<p>銀行承兌票據之分配於各種購主，其决定，大都　於市場之通行情形。每當銀根緊急利率高漲之際，銀行减少承兌票據之保有額，以所得欵充作他用，是時大宗未兌付票攘，轉入準備銀行之手，反之市場利率低落，銀行感運用利餘資金之困難，多願購買所承兌之票據，銀行之票據保存額，遂因其任公共市場之購買而大增矣。</p>
<p>故在　九二九年七月杪凖備齦行之票據保存額，（包括自己購入及代外國往來店購入在內），佔未兌付票據總額百分之四十七，反之在一九三四年七月杪，凖備銀行之保存承兌票據額，僅有一百萬美元左右，就中五十萬美　爲自行購入者，同時承兌銀行之保存額，佔未兌付票據總額百分之九十一。一九三四年四月市場票據之供給减少，票據商人制定不同之和率，以抵制銀行之向出票人購買自己票據，輓近承兌標據分配之變動情形，可於下表，得其梗概　。</p>

<h3>法郎不易穩固的因素</h3>
<p>— 莫湮</p>
<p>在一般危機時的世界經　　慌之下，碩果僅存的金本位制集團中，波蘭已脫離而去。估領袖地位的法郞，經過了多决不斷動搖之後，雖則終歸於平定，然而銀行存欵的擠提，黃余向海外的狂流，法郎對國外滙率的跌落，銀行貼現率的提高，同時國內的物價指數的上小漲，信用的收縮，在在有被迫出於停止金本位而使法郎貶什的可能。如今法國衆議員改選之結果，大有左頃之趨勢，法郞的前途，繫在新　成立後之施政方針。</p>
<p>法國金法郞制所以後於英美日等國而放棄，其最主要的一個原因，就是因爲法國的經濟恐慌發生比較遲一些緣故，即當一九二九年之後至九三三年爲止，世界資本主義國家的經濟恐慌，正當非常劇烈的時期，而法國的經濟恐慌程度却是比較的來得和緩一些，——自然這與大戰後法國生產破壞過甚經濟上需要恢復有相當關係的。法國嚴重性的經濟恐慌的發展，大的是於一九三一年末之後方始展開，其後直到現在爲止，可以說是尙沒有到達恐慌的最高點，（其他資本主義國家在一九三二年均已達最高點）所以法國的金本位制的動搖問題在一九三三年之後方始逐漸地嚴重起　。另外一個原因，使得法國在過去不能不維持金本位的，就是因爲法國在大戰後實行通貨膨脹的結果，已經損失了人民財產五分之四，而現在法國的人民中以金利爲生活者是佔着一個可觀的數目，所以法國大部人民是根本反對貶低幣値與通貨膨賬的。但是勉强地維持着金本位制，結果遂使法國經濟破壞到達現在嚴重的局面。</p>
<p>法國經濟上現在所發生出來的破綻，可以簡括的指出如下的幾個特徵。第一，就是國內物價相對的絕對的低落，工業生產指數因此也只會减少起來，故在一九三二年之後，各國資本全義國家雖然已經走上了不景氣的階段，而法國因爲金本制的瘤瘤作用的存在，終於使得恐慌繼續地發展下去了。今如假定法國工業生產的總指數在一九一三年爲一〇〇，則一九三四年平均爲七八，到去年八月止，除五月份指數降至七二·四外，各　均爲七三·二，比之前年八月之七六。四，更形下降是很明顯的。同時物價的下跌亦呈可怕的跌勢，法國工業生產品的躉售物價，若以一九二九年爲一〇〇，則一九三〇年爲八八·〇四，一九三一年爲八〇，一九三二年爲六八·二，一九三三年爲六〇·〇，一九三四年平均爲五四·〇，一九三五年平均爲五·七，這一種步跌的形勢完全可以看出法國經濟恐慌的發展性，比諸任何一國都要來得明顯。不僅工業生產品價格猛跌如此，即佔法國生產總額重要地位的農產物價格亦一樣的跌落不已，小麥·砂糖·葡萄酒·牛油·牛肉·蛋等之價格，在一九三五年　諸一九三四年均一致趨跌。第二因法郞價格過高之故，法國對外貿易上輸出絕對量的减少與入超數目的相對的增加，更使法國經濟恐慌加重起來。若把一九三五年法國貿易上輸出入商品總値與一九三叫年總値相比較，在一九三四年法國之輸出貿易總額爲廿九億零九千萬法郞，至一九三五年　减爲廿三億五千四百萬法郞；進口貿易額在一九三四年進口總額爲三十三億二千五百萬法郞，至一九三五年即减爲三十億二千零六萬法郞：其入超總額在一九三四年爲四十億一千六百萬法郞，至一九三五年則增至八億五千二百萬法郞，即達一倍光景。貿易輸出的逐减的原因無疑的是因爲法郞價格太高使生產成本費不能减低，故在海外市塲上法國的商品不易推銷。法國對外輸出之銳减，不但在各資本主義國家市塲上如此，即法屬殖民地上的市塲也漸有被別國擠倒之勢。第三法國財政困難與赤字的增加，因了金本位的關係更加嚴重了。一九三〇—一九三一年法國財政赤字爲三十億法郞，一九三三年爲一百億法郞。辛於一九三五至一九三六年的預算赤字究有多少，現在雖無從預察，但據專家的估量，赤字當達二百億法郞之巨額。法國預算的所以這樣不能均衡，一方面固然是因爲過去所發的公債過巨，（公債總額爲三千億法郞）每年需支出巨額之利子所致，但另一方面軍備擴大軍費支出甚巨，亦是其主要原因之一。收入漸减之理由當然不外乎是經濟恐慌的結果，這是因爲法國國家收入的主耍來源，幷不是出於富人身上的，而是多得之於大衆稅，工資稅，消費稅，與關稅的爲多，這些稅收的多寡，直接與景氣有關，所以近年來法國民衆的貧困與失業的增加影響了稅收的銳凌。但是余本位制的維持，旣然是只以助長經濟恐慌的火熖的，所以財政赤字的增加亦與金本制有相當的關係。此外如因法郞便格太高，使旅法者消費力减少，及德國之停付戰債，都使法國國際收支惡化，財政更形困難的原因。</p>
<p>以上所述各點，可以說是法郞不安擴大的根本經濟基礎，亦即是內在的資本主義經濟矛盾中產生出來的一個必然結果。雖然現在法國的金庫中黃余的保有量還佔着世界第二位，但是因爲經濟恐慌的發展與利潤量收人的减少，法郞的現狀維持是根本地動搖了。</p>
<p>近如德國駐兵萊茵區域與積極準備戰爭傾向，直接地使歐洲及法國的政局發生動搖，連帶地使法國的金融恐慌急性的爆發起來；再加以內部經濟恐慌的結果各階層利害衝突更甚起來，故有人以陣綫與法西斯蒂派的結成，這一種政治上的鬥爭激烈化最足使法國政局裂痕加深，使法國的統治者要求在貨幣制度的改革上去求得種新的武器，即企圖貶紙幣値來緩和法國的經濟恐慌與打　財政的難關。如果不久的將來因不得已而拋棄金本位，那末荷蘭瑞士也就不能不步法國的後塵了，金本位集團的最後堡壘的破壞，各資本主義國家在通貨膨脹中所得的暫時對外貿易的利益，也就會根本消滅，這樣以戰爭爲爭奪世界市塲的手段，會再被列强們所採用而引起再决人類的大屠殺，也是意中的事了，所以隨着金本位集團的崩壞，世界當展開新的局面，同時法國內部階　矛盾的尖銳與對立激化，我想這也是難免的吧。因爲法國如脫離了全本位之後，則對外貿易雖有時展開的可能，但國內市塲的縮少如工資相對的低落等亦是必然要發生的，同時法國廣大的金利生活者，因爲貨幣的貶値，他們的收入當然亦要　此大减，加速國內市塲的縮少，這樣法國經濟的復興恐怕還是絕大的問題吧。</p>

<p>淋菌因其抵抗力極强，故治法非普通藥療所能濟事，蓋即使表面上局部治愈，而病根仍未除也。是以近世倡用特殊療法（SpecifischeBehanDung.），採取雄壯動物體內之免疫抗菌原體，而加以化學的操作，創製成功德國淋病聖藥「克淋儂」。勝經泰西各國著名醫院實騐，證明此藥確具治淋之偉力，服後無論急慢性淋濁及攝護關節睪丸炎等，即能四五瓶吿瘳，不過七八瓶而歸根治！且屬澈底斷根，永無復發之虞！與他種局部「透膜殺菌」之藥不同。但須特別注意者，購服時務必認明眞正「克淋儂」三字，方不致受給，而免誤服誘起危險！Vannod氏曾以淋菌作二十日之培養，若摻入「克淋儂」成分中之免疫元體，於是此淋菌即發育不良或全不發育，終至悉數死亡，施諸動物試驗，其治績允爲驚人。此實爲免疫學上劃一新紀元！從此「克淋儂」之發明者彼得氏Biedel送獲博士學位，至今此藥流播各國，固方與未艾也</p>
<h3>討厭的白帶</h3>
<p>— 金月仁</p>
<p>白帶病，是女性最普見疾；亦爲女性最討厭疾患。如不速爲根治，易招外來細菌，因而釀成大患，如局部糜爛，小便刺痛，行路不便，更山此而發生月經困難，小腹膨脹作痛。及誘發失眠等。余患此患，每用德國「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，於臨睡前，取一片作爲坐藥。以消炎殺菌，收歛病灶。如由體虛而來者，可內服「補女容」，以强壯身體，而助制止分泌之效力。因染淋毒而來者，可內服「克淋儂」，以消弭內部菌毒，如此內外醫治，相得益彰，效力更大。故依此治療，恒能於三四星期，根本治愈。且療法簡捷。故「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，實最適宜於一般女子白帶病之在家自療藥也。</p>
<h3>久遠胃病吿痊</h3>
<p>— 姜叔玉來稿</p>
<p>余素體本虧，加以課務紛繁，致胃呆胃弱，見食生厭。胃部隱隱脹痛，頻發噁心，茶則嘔吐。胸中懊儂煩熱，允以晨起及空腹時爲甚。頭昏目花，噯酸上氣。自是身益孱瘦，漸見腦弱失眠。面容枯黃，衰憊症象，不一而足，屢經醫治，終難見效。後由友人介紹，示服德國「强胃精」一藥，服未四瓶，不惟胃部感從來未有之輕鬆舒適，且精神陡增，胃納强盛；即安心連服五瓶，各症霍然而治。體重增加，肌肉充盈，夜眠酣適。弱轉爲强。特函申謝，祈代爲表揚該藥之效力，俾同病者知所問津。凡患胃症者，固非服此不可也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「屍諫」與「懺悔」</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>報載日前有二個日本砲兵隊班長，相偕跳入鐵道中自殺。這兩人均爲富有前途的青年，爲何出此下策，當時頗爲一般人所懷疑。事後據該隊士兵的秘密傳說，謂二人皆係受過中等敎育，不易爲軍國主義所蒙蔽。一向堅持反戰態度，允反對本國的對　政策。這决决心自殺，殆含有屍諫的意義。</p>
<p>上面一段新聞，確有使人奇異之慮。日本這二位軍人，此决相偕自殺，有無別種的原因存在，是我們所無從知道的。要是他們的死，眞是爲的反對戰爭，不滿本國的對華政策，誠不愧爲有思想的靑年。從其反對侵略我國一點上說，他們還可稱爲中國之友。</p>
<p>在我們的心目中，軍國主義國家的軍人，像盡是虎狼似的，時時張牙舞爪的，等待撲人。我們一向就受慣侵略者士兵的踐踏。但實際怕不是如此的。在意阿戰爭中，意兵常有作反戰表示的。現在這兩個日本砲兵班長，且不惜出以屍諫。（？）這是最好的例子。</p>
<p>由這一件事實，我們就想起漢奸。我國自外敵慢入，一班賣國求榮之徒，乘機活動，爲虎作悵。這等奸人，實是國家之賊。罪不容誅。他們行爲的卑劣，若和這二位日本軍人一比，眞耍愧死。不見先日殷汝耕，已在表示懴悔。這個漢奸，自背叛祖國，在冀東組織偽政府，本極赫一時。近聞　因素和關束軍的聯絡深，與天津日軍部的關係淺。故自多田負冀察交涉專責後，他很自危。乃於前日至關帝廟，祈禱和平三天，表示懺悔。（？）其處境的可憐，有如是者。</p>
<p>這二事給我們不少的戚想。</p>
<h3>沙鷄子</h3>
<p>— 力雲</p>
<p>回到家嘗了一種野味呌做沙鷄子。這種鳥是不是就呌沙雞子不大知道，因爲送禮來的說是沙鷄子，我們便也這樣呌它。</p>
<p>沙鷄子的樣子很像鴿子，頭上有金黃色　道兒夾眼着，周身生着銀灰色木黃色的雜毛。在每根鴿毛的末端，有一個黑點色在灰黃色的中間，因此，黑色的特別顯，像綴着一粒粒的圓珠，這樣的顏色當然不算鮮明，但那一種雅緻，任誰見了都覺得可愛。在尾巴上有兩根尖的長毛，又出來像燕子似的，——我常想燕子是太小，好像一個很美相的女人，身量却異常的小；若是沙鷄子，這樣豐滿，飛起來，該是多麼好看！</p>
<p>沙鷄子送到我們家里來早都死了。但是還盯若滾圓的眼，短短的嘴上疑着血。身子都陳得挺硬了。</p>
<p>這鳥，在我們這里一向也見不着，鄉下人說，沙鷄子產在口外的沙漠地里，到不了內地來。今年天氣這樣冷，口外大雪蓋了地，沙鷄子打不出食來，逼進來了。</p>
<p>呵，是了，沙鷄子生長在長城以北，它認得黃沙，認得深草，認得牛羊，認得落日和蒙古包上冒出的烟，聽慣了牧馬的悲嗚：聽慣了遠處的駝鈴：聽慣了終年終夜的風。那是原始人的樂園。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>沙鵝子什麽憂愁也沒有。它的短嘴和圓眼是多麼淳厚，多麽溫良！它有硬的長翅子飛，可以抵抗風；它有厚的皮，軟的毛可以抵抗冷；此外什麼也不知道，也無法知道。</p>
<p>但是它們不得不走，它們成千疊萬，茫然地飛出來了。</p>
<p>沙鷄子越過長城南來，看我們這里比口外差着多少。沙鷄子對於這一片沃野是不是比愛沙漠好呢？但是沙鷄子原只預備在沙漠里生活，只有三個短趾，又生着厚的黑皮，想來從沒落村上過；夜里，便成羣地宿在我們的南窪里。於是，沙鷄子的危運便來了。</p>
<p>鄉下人冬天不種田，沒有事做，年輕的人們閒着難過，他們的眼也特別尖，這麽些鳥來了，問老的，老的說，一定是口外來的，就是沙鷄子。年輕人高興極了，甚麼是冷？在將沒太陽的時候，他們帶着綱下窪去了。</p>
<p>沙鷄子有硬的翅膀，但是被關在網里時所需要的是銳齒和利爪；只能飛是無用的，這地方，那大窪，正像我們的祖先夢想着的「寳地」，遍地是黃金，沙鷄子在沙漠地里只有草糧可吃，但是這里，有這麽多高糧，紅得像珍珠，撒在地里沙鷄子該忘記沙漠了。沙鷄子不認得網，甚麽是網？當沙鷄子一粒粒地啄着高糧，命運早經定了一個歸宿。</p>
<p>鄉下人說，沙鷄子眞傻，一碰就進網，一網可以捉二三十隻，所以從那麽遙遠的塞外來，應該是很珍貴的，然而沙鷄子並不貴。差不多好吃野味的人家，家家都買幾隻煮在鍋里。</p>
<p>今年天氣確乎太冷了。這天沒有了風，也和暖一些，我出後門去看看，沙鷄子已經吃完了，沙鷄子的絨毛，都掛在枯草上了</p>
<h3>「梅蘿香」觀後</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>中國旅行劇四在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>從人羣中走出卡爾登戲院，冷冷的春風從跑馬廳直吹過來，老爺們挾着他嬌麗的女伴坐上簇新的汽車，我默默地在想：「在「梅蘿香」的台下，有沒有「白森卿」那樣的人呢？有沒有「馬子英」那樣的人呢？再說，有沒有「梅蘿香」那樣的人呢？」</p>
<p>下意識地，好像有人在我耳邊說：「有的！」</p>
<p>是的，是有的，在這個社會沒有變得合理之前，在資產社會中的買辦階級不曾消滅之前，在戲劇還是老爺少爺們消遣的玩意兒的時候，是不會沒有「白森卿」，「梅蘿香」這樣的人物存在的。卽使「梅蘿香」不是「坤伶」。她也無法逃出「白森卿們」的掌握！</p>
<p>然而，要是梅蘿香的意志不那樣脆弱，她在受盡白森卿種種暗中破壞之後，要是勇敢地，直率地去告訴她遠在厦門的愛人馬子英，那麽，馬子英能吾和她白頭偕老呢？</p>
<p>我站在這樣的沉思裏，一直到家，我處處往好的地方去着想，最後，我還是覺得：如果梅夢香以後肯關起大門做她的賢妻良母，而對於馬子英的「自由」（這是說關於和女人糾葛的自由。）絲毫不去干涉，那或許是能白頭偕老的；要是梅蘿香嫁人是預備做一個「人」的話，那麽，她是會失望的。</p>
<p>馬子英要梅蘿香的，不是愛而是「愛的眞操」，</p>
<p>他不關事實如何，他祗知道要梅蘿香守着愛的貞操守着他，等他發了財來娶她。或者，窮苦地和他守着一身。</p>
<p>梅蘿香能吾淡泊自甘的守窮下去呢？這在現在的結果是可以看出來的，在白森卿的估計下是不錯的；　要是梅蘿香是回到馬子英那裏去了，（假如馬子英不曾知道梅白再度同居的事情）那以後會怎樣呢？</p>
<p>如果馬子英依然窮，那麽兩個人相守一身或許是難的，但馬子英因開礦而成爲富翁了，在過了相當時期之後，這個有着非常的佔有慾的自私者，他將會發現梅蘿香過去的缺點，他會覺得梅蘿香給他的還不是整個的美滿不缺的東西，他會不滿於梅夢香過去曾和人同居過，說得再透澈一些，他會因梅蘿香的處女貞操不是供獻給他的而有所不滿。結果，他會把梅蘿香幽禁在「天職」裏面，而自己去到別的女人身上去找補償，因爲他也有了錢。</p>
<p>接着，我又想到：像現在那樣，白森卿和馬子英都走了，梅夢香將會怎樣呢？自殺嗎？覺醒了嗎？還是和被春蘭那樣呢？</p>
<h3>唐槐秋飾白森卿</h3>
<p>— 席與羣攝</p>
<p>照現在那樣的梅蘿香。她是不會覺醒也不會自殺的，餘下的祇有妥恊，不是再回到白森卿的懐抱中去，便是像筱春蘭那樣，另外去找第二個白森卿這樣的人物。</p>
<p>在劇本上，在演出上·認的的遺也就是這些，馬子英的自　的佔有够强調，（事實上，馬子　佔白森樣可憎惡的傢伙）而梅蘿香的意志　　也嫌做得不够，因着這樣，我們憎惡的對象往往會偏於白森卿身上而對馬子英則曲予諒解，梅蘿香的意志脆弱，也就給了我們飄忽無定，難以捉摸的戚覺了。</p>
<p>這一次的演出上，舞台裝置，燈光等等，依舊可說是很好的，不過第幕的「硬片」，似太嫌陳舊些，以致赭色的布片上，一根根的顯出木框的骨子。</p>
<p>演員的演技，最好的是唐槐秋，白森卿的陰險奸猾，都經他很深刻的表現出來，不過，或許是由於太熟練的綠故，在有幾個動作裏，却嫌油滑了些，如果能够克服這個缺點，那是不難到爐火純靑的地步的，戴涯的秦呌天，在這裏掃除了把字音刻得太長的毛病，所以感到特別可愛，章曼蘋的梅羅香的大體上可說是稱職的，祗有在第二幕，她的轉變，却不够說明情感轉變的過程，唐若靑的筱春蘭，在大動作上固然很刻劃出筱春蘭這一類女性的典型來了。但如果能留意她的嗓子，在小動作上再給筱春蘭多一些雕塑，我想一定會更好的。因爲一個角色的輸廊固然是得用大動作來描繪，而要是這個角色變成精緻，那是非靠小動作來加以修飾不可的。</p>
<h3>五月</h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>五月，已入了暮春的季候。天氣是溫暖的，溫暖得近於憂鬱。</p>
<p>夜，暮氣已罩滿了支加哥這龐大的城，是一天中最寗靜，最平和的時侯。吵鬧，呌囂，無終止機械的奔吼，在這時都沉寂着，消失了。</p>
<p>溫克特，一個已經失業了半年的中年工人，在這時正踏着支加哥一條最最沉靜，最最陰暗的街道走着。他是剛從克倫街一個親戚家里借着錢回來的。因爲他們底不可忽視的友誼，他很快地便從這位工程師的親戚手里，得到　和他底一家所需要的三天麵包。雖然祇是那麽少的一點點，可是溫克特却感動着，他底步伐雖然走得那麽堅决，粗重，腦子里却仍有力地在浮動着老工程師底歡快的面孔。</p>
<p>「他是一個出色的傢伙！」他對自己喃着，却忘記自己已跑完克倫街而轉過另一條街道了。這街道，他熟識的，一條出色地穢汚的街道，然而在支加哥這城市却誰也知道，因爲它有著名的娼婦和小偷。</p>
<p>他走着，用那堅定的步伐走着，五月的凉風微微的吹拂過了他那寬敞的舊外套，深深的刺在他底胸膛的毛孔上，使他感到微微有點寒冷。他把外套稍爲拉緊一下，便又提着步望那沉靜的街上邁進。</p>
<p>突地，他在一家地下室酒店外停止。了。因爲他聽見一陣粗亢的，快活的歌聲，是從那透出微弱燈光的地下室洋溢出來的。它非常地堅强而有力的吸住他，使他禁不住想起了過去那愉快的生活。這歌他唱過的，那是爲着五月而唱的；但是他和這歌分離足足是一年了。在這一年中，他沉澱在生的活呼號與飢餓里，爲着家里的妻和兩個小孩子，他不但不會想起了這歌，幾乎也忘記了。現在，這歌又在他底耳邊嗡鳴着，是這麼地親摯，這麽地有力的吸住他，幾至使他忘神，他想起了；這是五月！</p>
<p>「工作八點鐘！」</p>
<p>歌聲輕輕地掦着，充滿興奮和熱力，在地下室流着，匯成一股幾十人的大合唱。</p>
<p>「沐息八點鐘！」（未完）</p>

<p>開篇　「欽頭鳳」</p>
<p>多情　是總痴情。薄命紅顏自古云。我蕙仙，幼失椿萱無依靠。伶仃餋媳到陸門。姑表訂婚原屬義。一家歡樂度光陰。更喜表兄情亦重。喃喃小語話溫存。恨只恨，尼僧不空貪募化。悔只悔，婉詞諫阻結仇深。釵頭鳳，碎落豈有意。惹出非常禍不輕。播弄無非圖報復。世間可殺是尼僧。讒言進母將奴害。萬苦千辛委曲承。姑怒不消心更變。竟使我，空門獨處受欺凌。惡尼賤業曾誘到。爲守貞操誓不遵。良人何知速赴試。愁腸萬種向誰評。郞雖歸來幸見面。益悲傷，蓮花並蒂已難成。可憐我，得賦斷腸豈忍讀。可憐我，淚珠點點濕難襟。可憐我，思前想後難入夢。可憐我，反覆終宵睡不寗。可憐我，惟悴容顏怕對鏡。可憐我，纏綿床第病眞成。可憐我，鯤絃應續再叮嚀。可憐我，絕而復甦婆婆喚。不能定省侍晨昏。愿姑且把愁眉展。須恕媳婦不孝名。自歎孽緣宿世定。折　何必怨他人。只望蒼天知我意。人生聚散本浮萍。甘心瞑目赴幽冥。</p>

<h3>Negotiations Regarding the Eastern Hebei Incident Proceed on Two Fronts; Song Zheyuan to Return to Beiping in a Day or Two; Negotiations to Continue in Beiping; Imai and Others Inspected Tongxian Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Because Song Zheyuan is still needed to preside over diplomatic affairs, his return to Beiping has been temporarily delayed. The Eastern Hebei matter is currently being negotiated on two fronts: direct negotiations with the Japanese side and indirect persuasion of those connected with the rebellious Yin [Rugeng] to awaken them and voluntarily dissolve the puppet organization. The authorities recognize the tense situation in North China, saying it has already become a thing of the past. (Special telegram of the 3rd) Matsumuro returned to Beiping on the afternoon of the 3rd, and the Eastern Hebei issue will be moved to Beiping for continued discussion.

<p>(Beiping) In the evening talks, Matsumuro only met with Song Zheyuan twice in Tianjin and did not have in-depth discussions on diplomatic issues, so there were no so-called results. It is heard that Song, Xiao, and others will all come to Beiping within a day or two, at which time everything will continue to be discussed in Beiping. Tada is scheduled to return to his country at the end of the month to assume the position of division commander. (Special telegram of the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Hebei Civil Servants and Students Hold Disciplinary Review</h3>
<p>(Baoding) At 6:30 AM on the 3rd, all staff members of the provincial government offices held a disciplinary review in Nanguan.

<h3>The Rebellious Yin Engages in Private Salt Trade in Hangu</h3>
<p>Smuggled Goods Plunge in Price</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng has established the North China Salt Industry Company in Hangu, selling the salt stored in the Changlu salt marshes to certain foreigners, who ship it to various coastal counties and towns in Jiaodong for private sale. He has also allowed the puppet Manchukuo to establish the Manchurian Salt Industry Association to engage in private salt trade and sales. The authorities have already negotiated with a certain party to request a halt. The price of smuggled seafood products has plummeted. Sea cucumber has fallen from 220 yuan to 170 yuan per 100 pounds, and dried scallops have fallen from 110 yuan to 80 yuan per 100 pounds. Sales are still sluggish. (Special telegram of the 3rd)</p>

<h3>The Draft Constitution to be Promulgated Tomorrow</h3>

However, the organizational law of the National Assembly and the representative election law have not been submitted to the National Government due to the urgency of the procedures, and it is still difficult to determine whether they can be promulgated at the same time as the draft constitution.

<h3>The Cangshi Railway Construction Plan Has Not Been Determined</h3>
<p>—Remarks by Pan Yugui—</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Pan Yugui, the Cangshi Railway construction plan has not been determined and will only be studied when the Communications Committee is established. Although the construction cost is set at 16 million, the route may start from Qikou and end at Jingxing, connecting with the Jingxing light railway. If the road is re-laid with wide-gauge rails, the construction cost will be huge. Regarding the Beining Railway's responsibility for construction funds, it is actually difficult to obtain such strength. This point also needs to be studied and decided. (Special telegram of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Cangshi Railway construction plan is currently being revised by relevant parties. It is heard that the authorities intend to slightly extend the road, and discussions are underway daily. The old roadbed of the railway has been mostly damaged over the past ten years and will need to be repaired before construction begins. (Central News Agency telegram of the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Bandits Have Been Eradicated in Zhongyang County; No Traces of Bandits Along the River in Lishi and Xingxian in Western Shanxi; Xu Yongchang Hosted a Banquet for Gao Guizi and Others at the Provincial Government in the Evening</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The bandit troops of Xu Lin and others were severely damaged by the Guan [Linfeng] division's heavy blows. The remnants are still fleeing westward, relying on dangerous terrain to struggle. Yang ChengYuan and Tang Enbo's troops have arrived at Xixian County overnight from southern Shanxi to join forces with Guan Linfeng to pursue and suppress the bandits. The bandits have also adopted a resistance strategy to counter our encirclement strategy, forcibly conscripting young men to replenish their strength and building fortifications in the bandit areas in an attempt to make a final struggle. After our army cleared the area, there are no traces of bandits along the river in Lishi and Xingxian in western Shanxi. Sun Chu telegraphed that the bandits in Zhongyang County have been completely eradicated. Gao Guizi and Fan Hou are about to leave Bing.

<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters of the 25th Division of the Army telegraphed Nanjing on the 3rd to report the victorious pursuit and suppression of the remnant bandits of Lin Xu. The telegram stated briefly that it was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief Chen to relay the Deputy Seat's cable dated the 30th of the month, stating that the Guan Division had fiercely fought more than 10,000 remnant bandits of Lin Xu in Xixian County, achieving repeated victories and capturing the most prisoners. The officers and soldiers were brave and commendable and should be awarded another 5,000 yuan in ocean coins as encouragement. The telegram stated: (A) The bandit troops of Lin Biao, Xu Donghai, and Liu Zidan have now gathered in western Xixian County, occupying positions along the line of Pengmen Zhangjiayuan, Qianhou Caijiayuan, Qingsucun, Rangshapu Village, and Xiguxiang; (B) Our Liang Brigade launched an attack on Zhangjiayuan and Pengmen in the early morning of the 30th, breaking through the bandit positions at Zhangjiayuan and encircling Xu's bandit army headquarters, causing Xu's bandits to flee in a panic and almost being captured alive. Fierce fighting continued until noon, when the bandits launched a stubborn counterattack from Qianhou Caijiayuan with their main force. The fighting was extremely fierce, and after a partial flanking attack by our Liang Brigade, they retreated in disarray in the late afternoon, retreating to the south mountain to Qiansun Village, Dongzhuang, Hesunzhuang, and Diao Jia Zhuang, where they are in confrontation with us. In this battle, we captured more than 200 long and short guns, four heavy machine guns, two Xu bandit army flags, six horses, and more than 200 bandit prisoners, and killed countless bandits. We also suffered slight casualties. (Central News Agency telegram of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Yang Hucheng entered Hancheng last month to establish a headquarters, directing the suppression of the remnant bandits in northern Shaanxi. Currently, the progress on the front is quite rapid. The remnant bandits north of Yichuan have been wiped out, and our army is advancing towards Yanchuan and extending the line. Yang returned to the province from the anti-bandit military affairs to report to the headquarters and request instructions. He returned to the province from Han on the 2nd, and after completing his official business, he will go to the front again within days to supervise the suppression of the remnant bandits.

<h3>The Significance of the French Parliamentary Elections</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The French Chamber of Deputies held a re-election on May 26. Because only 183 candidates in the 618 electoral districts nationwide were elected by an absolute majority, a second election was held one week later, on the 3rd of this month. In this election, candidates only need to obtain a relative majority of votes to be elected. During this one-week deliberation period, the various parties that are closer can unite or agree to have the most promising candidate on the same front elected. Therefore, the results of yesterday's re-election are now largely clear by this morning. Based on recent observations, it is predicted that the People's Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, will have a large majority of victories in this election.</p>
<p>International observers have commented on the elections in Spain and France this year, believing that both have great significance. The victory of the Spanish People's Front proves that the fascist government's dissatisfaction with public opinion after the Catalan incident in October 1934. And the firm unity of the People's Front in this French election and its support by most voters show that the fascist forces in France have also reached a dead end. Comparatively speaking, the victory of the masses in the Spanish election is more significant than that in France, but in terms of France's position in Europe, the huge impact of this election far exceeds that of Spain. Let us try to discuss the impact of this French election on domestic and foreign affairs separately.</p>
<p>In French domestic politics, the victory of this election shows the success of the unity and cooperation of the various parties of the People's Front. Since the European War, the left and right-wing parties in France have had distinct banners. The left wing, with the orthodox Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Communist Party as the backbone, formed the "Left Cartel" or the People's Front. The right wing, with the Republican Democratic Union and the Conservative Party as the backbone, constituted the "National Front." However, according to past observations, although the Radical Socialist Party has a larger influence, its wavering policies have failed to win the firm support of the masses with clear policies, which is a fatal flaw in its repeated administrations. The Radical Socialist Party and its allies won in the 1924 and 1932 elections, but both failed to last for this reason. However, in the recent election, the left-wing parties adhered to the program of the People's Front, advocating for the defense of democratic politics, anti-fascism, improving people's living standards, and striving for international peace. There was absolutely no hesitation in the election, and they were able to gain the trust of the people and achieve a final victory. In the future, in the direction of French domestic politics, the power of the masses will have a more obvious manifestation.</p>
<p>In terms of European international diplomacy, the impact of this French election is to further consolidate the collective security system. The victory of the People's Front shows that the French people have firmly supported the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty. La Rocque, the leader of the Croix-de-Feu, once stated that France and Germany should unite to form an alliance of fascist states. Laval also advocated that France and Germany must cooperate to establish a permanent peace in Europe. These statements were made in opposition to the Franco-Soviet Treaty. However, the French people clearly know that Hitler's steady advance has no real sincerity for European peace, and the signing of the Franco-Soviet Treaty is an important pillar for supporting European peace. Therefore, the result of this election also has a huge impact on European security and peace.</p>

He stayed in Longyan for a day, and after inspecting, he returned to the province via Zhang. (Central News Agency telegram of the 3rd)</p>
<h3>The Fujian-Sui Garrison Headquarters Issued a Circular Order to Intensify the Suppression of Scattered Bandits</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Garrison Headquarters believed that although the scattered bandits in various counties have been closely suppressed by various armies recently, and have gradually been cleared, many cunning remnant bandits are still hiding in various places, and it is difficult to eliminate them as they are suppressed in one place and flee to another. In order to completely eliminate them, a special circular order was issued to the garrison troops in various counties and districts, stating that they must intensify the suppression of scattered bandits without regard to boundaries or the passage of bandits through the city, and that the administrative district security command should forward the order to the county heads and their subordinate district security teams and militia teams, etc., to suppress bandits whenever and wherever they are encountered, without waiting for a report to superiors, in order to avoid delays and benefit the military. As for the defense forces or militia teams stationed in various counties, they should also maintain close contact with the troops in neighboring counties at all times. Upon hearing of a bandit alarm, they should immediately send troops to suppress them in order to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. (Central News Agency telegram of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Several hundred bandits from the Datian Society turned to harass Yongchun. The Xie Brigade of the Ninth Division sent Peng Tang's troops on the 2nd to track and suppress them.

<h3>The Dongzhuang Dike Closure Project Held an Acceptance Ceremony</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) After three months of arduous dike closure, the Dongzhuang Dike Closure Project was successfully completed on March 27, creating a magnificent dike and allowing the disaster-stricken people of Jiangsu and Shandong to celebrate their return to farming. The Economic Commission specifically scheduled an acceptance ceremony to be held in Dongzhuang on the 2nd, and the project was transferred to the custody of the Shandong Provincial Government. National Government acceptance representative Shen Li, Economic Commission acceptance representative Chuan Rulin, and Supervisory Yuan supervision representative Wang Pingzheng and others gathered in Bian on the evening of the 1st, where they were personally hosted by Kong Xiangrong. On the morning of the 2nd, the entire group of more than twenty people departed from Bian by night train and arrived in Dongzhuang. Thousands of farmers stood along the road to welcome them, and hundreds of soldiers lined up to play music. Banners and slogans such as "Welcome the Central Acceptance Officials," "Welcome the Central Government Representatives to Inspect the Project," and "Celebrate the Success of the Closure" were displayed throughout the village. After getting off the train, Fu and others consulted with the Shandong Chairman Han Fuju's representative to discuss the acceptance procedures, which began at 2:30 PM. Led by Committee Member Kong, they inspected the various new dams, starting from the Jiangsu dam, and found them to be extremely solid. They then went to the Fourth Diao Dike, where the construction used new dikes to take root in order to facilitate the acceptance of the Jiangsu dam's water diversion power. The dike was moved north, and they then went to the closure construction site, which stretched for several miles from the first checkpoint to the closure point. Kong gave a detailed explanation of the importance of the project and the difficult process of construction, and made the following remarks: "Today, the Central Government and the Yuan have sent officials to Dongzhuang to accept the dike closure project and transfer it to Shandong Province for management. We are very honored to have guests from all walks of life to guide us. Since the Republic of China in the 22nd year, breaches have occurred every year, and the same ceremony has been held after each closure. In addition to the acceptance of the transfer matters, Xiangrong cannot help but have endless feelings. Recalling the difficulties of the three dike closures and the suffering of the people in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, I once advocated that the most important thing this year is to avoid breaches. In order to achieve the goal of no breaches, we must unify river affairs, unite the people and the government, and work together on prevention and repair. The Yellow River water is still difficult to flow out between the north-south folk dikes and the main dike, because there are many dangerous works near Dongzhuang, such as the Xiaoxin dike on the south bank, Dongbatou, Lengzhai, Liuzhuang, Zhukou, Chenqiao on the north bank, Shiche section, and North Three sections. Once there is a loss of universality, the danger is worrying. It is appropriate to inspect the entire river first, starting from the three families that do not breach, and then plan the river management plan to ensure permanent safety."

<h3>Compensation Measures in Place for the Abolition of Transit Tax</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance originally planned to abolish the transit tax and reduce or exempt the export tax, which would result in a total annual revenue shortfall of more than 20 million yuan, so it has not yet been implemented.

<h3>East African War a Foregone Conclusion; Addis Ababa in Great Chaos; Emperor Haile Selassie Flees the Country on a British Warship, Destination Unknown; Attempts to Fight for Independence Through Diplomatic Means</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received news from Abyssinia last night, stating that arson and looting occur daily in the capital city, causing extreme chaos. The imperial palace and commercial district have been reduced to ashes, and gunfire can be heard everywhere, with many casualties. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to the third telegram sent at 10 PM last night by the American Minister to Abyssinia, Engert, the fire in Addis Ababa is still spreading, thousands of refugees are fleeing the city, and bandits are intoxicated and committing crimes, causing much damage. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Djibouti Port: The Emperor of Abyssinia and his family recently left the port on the British destroyer "Diana", refusing to make any declarations before their departure. The "Diana" has a displacement of 1,400 tons and was originally assigned to the 8th Division of the British Far East Fleet. It was recently stationed at the port of Aden. After the Emperor's flight, it was ordered to sail to the port of Djibouti to escort the Emperor. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The special train carrying the Emperor of Abyssinia and his family arrived in Djibouti this afternoon from Addis Ababa. The Emperor made no statement and boarded a British warship with his entourage, destination unknown. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: After the Emperor of Abyssinia fled, the Abyssinian government's radio station ceased broadcasting. The Reuters correspondent stationed in Addis Ababa sent a telegram from the British Legation, describing the situation in Addis Ababa. It stated that after a day of hesitation, the Emperor decided late last night, under pressure from the Empress, that his only option was to leave the country. Since the League of Nations could not assist Abyssinia, and the weaponry of the Italian army was far superior to that of the Abyssinian army, continued resistance would only result in further loss of life. In the afternoon, the Emperor hastily departed the capital with the Empress and his family, still attempting to fight for independence through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>Djibouti Port: The Abyssinian royal family left Addis Ababa yesterday and arrived here at 4:00 AM this morning. News from Addis Ababa indicates that Italian planes dropped leaflets stating that the throne of Abyssinia should be inherited by the grandson of former Emperor Menelik the Great, the son of deposed Emperor Iyasu. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia, along with the Empress and members of the royal family, fled Addis Ababa at dawn today and are expected to arrive in Djibouti tonight. Various circles in Abyssinia still expect the Emperor to leave his special train within Abyssinian territory, but according to other sources, the Emperor will go to British-controlled Palestine. Although the Emperor has left Abyssinia, he is no longer ruling the country in fact, but remains the monarch of Abyssinia in law. It is also reported that Abyssinian government officials have left the capital by car with important documents and are believed to be heading to the city of Gore, sixty miles southwest of Addis Ababa. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Rumors are circulating that the Emperor of Abyssinia has boarded a British warship and is heading to the British Mandate of Palestine. This news has not yet been confirmed. Official sources are unwilling to make any declarations about where the Emperor intends to flee. The Foreign Office believes that since the Emperor is the Grand Marshal of Abyssinia, he should be treated as a prisoner of war once he leaves the country, and the authorities of the place of exile should guarantee his safety. A British semi-official legal scholar recently told a correspondent from this agency that the Emperor's flight could be viewed in two ways under law: Within the scope of the League of Nations, Italy has been recognized as an aggressor nation, and the Emperor of Abyssinia is the head of a nation that has been invaded. Therefore, it is justified for the British government to allow the Emperor to take refuge in Palestine. If the League of Nations is disregarded and only pure international law is considered, then Britain, as a neutral nation, should detain the commander of a belligerent nation upon entry. In general, Britain will likely act according to the first interpretation. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) A French government official stated today that he had received a report that the Emperor of Abyssinia would arrive in Djibouti on Saturday and planned to take a British ship to Palestine. It is reported that General Badoglio's army of 40,000 was ready to enter Addis Ababa on Friday, but the reason for the delay was to establish a secret agreement with the Abyssinian government. The Emperor urged his cabinet throughout last night to resist to the end, but the cabinet members all demanded surrender. The Emperor, seeing that even his close subordinates were showing signs of instability, had no choice but to leave the capital. French observers predict that once General Badoglio arrives in Addis Ababa, he will begin peace talks between Italy and Abyssinia. It is understood that the Emperor has designated high-ranking officials to represent him in the proceedings. Abyssinian officials say that the Emperor will be guaranteed safety in Djibouti until he boards the ship for Palestine. It is understood that if the Emperor cannot return to his country in the future, he plans to go to France. (2nd National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Situation of Riots in Addis Ababa; Ruffians Indiscriminately Burn, Kill, and Loot; Royal Palace and Commercial District Ablaze; Foreign Nationals Take Refuge in Legations and Embassies, Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>(London) After the thugs and scattered soldiers looted the royal palace in Addis Ababa, they are now firing guns and robbing at will in the streets, and setting fire to houses, so the entire city has become a large fire ground. However, all foreigners are able to safely reach their own legations and embassies. According to responsible sources last night, there have been no reports of foreign casualties. After the news of the Emperor and his family fleeing the capital yesterday morning spread, the entire city was thrown into chaos. The Ghebbi (imperial palace) was the first to be looted, and armed gangs have been looting shops all day, killing and burning at will.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the U.S. State Department received a telegram from U.S. Minister to Abyssinia Engert stating that the center of Addis Ababa is currently burning. Addis Ababa has fallen into the hands of mobs, who are looting and firing rifles and volleys of gunfire. Some bullets struck the walls of the U.S. Legation. The residence of U.S. Vice-Consul Cramp has been looted by mobs, but Mr. Cramp and other staff at the legation are safe. Thirty Greeks and six Russians, including women and children, feared falling into the hands of mobs and have taken refuge in the U.S. Legation. The State Department also received a telegram from the U.S. Minister sent at 7:00 PM Abyssinian time stating that they had received news from two American churches that they were currently not in danger, but the city was still in chaos. An American correspondent was stabbed while driving through a crowd of rioters. They appeared to have large numbers of rifles and bullets seized from the military and police. Dead bodies could be seen lying in the streets from the windows of the U.S. Legation. However, so far, no foreigners have been killed or injured. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Before his departure, the Emperor ordered the opening of the Gibi palace to allow the people to take what they wanted from it. Soon, crowds of men and women came from all directions to the Gibi. When they returned, they were carrying clothes, bedding, carpets, furniture, and various weapons on their shoulders and in their hands. The Emperor also ordered the opening of the armories, and thousands of people poured in, carrying away boxes of ammunition. Suddenly, the sound of gunfire echoed throughout the city like a barrage of machine guns, as if a major war was underway. The people were overjoyed to have acquired ammunition and were firing into the sky, not intending to shoot anyone. When the people learned that the Emperor and cabinet members had all left the capital, the thugs began looting shops. In the streets, men and women could be seen wearing high hats and European clothes, laughing and running, looking rather foolish. Soon, because of excessive drinking, they began to fight over the loot. Some angrily drew knives, and others fired guns. Suddenly, corpses were lying all over the streets. The white goods store of Mohammed Ali was surrounded by mobs. British Consul Gill, along with Indian shop assistants, bravely defended it, but they were eventually rescued by a squad of guards from the British Legation. Many British nationals have taken refuge in the garden of the British Legation, where organized tents have been set up. Many British nationals have assisted helpless nationals from other countries, many of whom were in danger of being harmed. Refugees recounted their dangerous experiences, with many of their homes or shops being burned and looted. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the latest official telegram from Addis Ababa, French nationals in Addis Ababa are safely residing in the French Legation, but railway employees are still working at the station.

<p>(Paris) Order in Addis Ababa this morning is chaotic. It is reported that the imperial palace has also been looted. French nationals in the capital have all taken refuge in the French legation. The legation is surrounded by barbed wire, and a squad of Askaris (native soldiers) armed with machine guns is stationed nearby to provide defense. Protective structures have also been built to prevent Italian planes from dropping bombs. Recently, a portion of French nationals have left the capital to take refuge in the city of Dire Dawa (on the railway line between Addis Ababa and the port of Djibouti). The railway station is guarded by a company of Senegalese soldiers. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: The British government has offered the British Legation in Addis Ababa as a refuge for American nationals, which has been accepted by the U.S. government. There are about 100 American nationals in Addis Ababa, most of whom are missionaries. The local newspapers are all running headlines about the news of the Emperor's flight. Several newspapers speculate that the Emperor may go to Geneva to make a final effort to achieve a settlement. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Government Urges Italian Army to Enter Addis Ababa Quickly</h3>
<p>The Vanguard is Only Twenty-Five Miles from the Capital</p>
<p>(Paris) In view of the seriousness of the situation in Addis Ababa, the French government has telegraphed the Italian government, and the Italian government immediately ordered the Italian commander to order the vanguard to advance. The Italian vanguard was twenty-five miles from Addis Ababa last night and is said to have been ordered to advance overnight, and it is expected to reach Addis Ababa today. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that the Italian army will arrive in the capital of Abyssinia today. Because of the Emperor's flight and the chaotic order in Addis Ababa, the French government urged the Italian government to send troops as soon as possible to protect foreign nationals. The Italian High Command ordered a detachment currently forty kilometers from Addis Ababa to advance rapidly towards Addis Ababa. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Make Important Declaration</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Deputies Will Meet Today</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Emperor of Abyssinia's flight, the Italian Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet tomorrow. At that time, all members of parliament should wear Fascist Party uniforms, and Prime Minister Mussolini will make an important declaration, which is highly anticipated by the general public. The proceedings of the meeting will also be broadcast by radio everywhere. Loudspeakers have been installed in all thoroughfares and squares to allow the public to listen to the Prime Minister's speech. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Famous journalist Gaida recently published an article in the semi-official Italian "People's Voice" newspaper, saying, "After the Emperor of Abyssinia fled in a hurry, it is clear that the affairs of the country are no longer workable. He has already admitted this first. It can also be seen from this that he does not want to stay with his people to the end. The Emperor's move is a clear indication to the world that since the Italian army's large-scale offensive, he not only does not want to continue fighting, but also does not understand the difference between public and private interests and neglects the people. The anarchy in the capital of Abyssinia further shows that the so-called regime of the Abyssinian government has disappeared." (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Attitude Towards the New Situation in Italy and Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Determined to Maintain Peace with a Spirit of Realism</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden only briefly mentioned the Italy-Abyssinia problem in his speech in Leamington yesterday, saying that we must use the lessons learned in the past seven months and pursue Britain's policy of maintaining peace with a spirit of realism. We have fulfilled our responsibilities, not for imperial or selfish purposes, and we have nothing to blame ourselves for. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the news of the Emperor of Abyssinia's flight reached this country, Foreign Secretary Eden immediately convened Sir Vansittart, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and experts from the Foreign Office to discuss the new situation in the Italy-Abyssinia dispute. It lasted five hours before the end. The Cabinet is also scheduled to meet on Monday (May 4) to discuss it. It is generally expected that the British government will immediately contact France about the issue of peace between Italy and Abyssinia. Foreign Office officials believe that it would be a big mistake for Italy to regard Abyssinia as a private possession and directly control it. They hope that Italy and Abyssinia will sign a peace treaty respecting Abyssinia's independence. Financial figures say that Britain will occupy an important position in future peace negotiations, because the economic development of Abyssinia in the future will depend on British financial assistance. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tokyo is Extremely Concerned; Determined to Protect Commercial Interests in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Because Japan has signed commercial treaties with Abyssinia and Japanese people have invested interests in Abyssinia, the Japanese authorities are extremely concerned about the situation in Abyssinia. It is estimated that Japanese exports to Abyssinia are worth about 10 million Japanese yen per year. It is now feared that it will be seized by Italy. It is said that Japan is now pursuing a positive independent policy and will take appropriate plans to protect its rights. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Emperor of Abyssinia Flees in Haste; Paris is Relieved; Rome is Exuberant</h3>
<p>(Paris) The news of the Emperor of Abyssinia's flight has been received with relief here. It is generally felt that France's "go slow" policy has been appropriate, and it is believed that the solidarity of sanctions against Italy has now been broken. According to news received by political circles here, the Emperor's flight seems to have been decided at the last minute. The Emperor met with French Ambassador Bodaudet yesterday and asked if the Empress and royal family would be safe if they left Addis Ababa. The ambassador replied that they would be very safe if they went to Djibouti. At that time, the Emperor said that he might also leave the capital in the next few days. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The news of the Emperor of Abyssinia's flight has been received with great joy here. However, political circles have very little comment on this, saying that the Emperor's flight has little impact from a military point of view, because the Italian army is still advancing rapidly. The Emperor had issued a final mobilization order, but his generals did not respond. The Emperor saw that the general situation was over, so he decided to flee. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Political circles here are very disappointed with the Emperor's flight. They all say that the Italian army has now won the final victory. However, the general public originally thought that the Emperor should move the capital to the mountainous area on the border between British Egypt and Sudan to continue resisting. Now it is suddenly strange that he fled. In general, the Emperor himself still wanted to fight to the end, but the troops under his command had been fighting bloody battles on the front lines for six months, facing Italian aircraft and artillery with inferior armaments, and suffering from Italian gas attacks, and had no fighting spirit. The Emperor himself also knew very well that all European countries were fully coping with the German problem and had no time to take care of the Italy-Abyssinia war. After thinking it over again and again, he had no choice but to flee the country. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Biography of the Emperor of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Emperor of Abyssinia resisted a powerful enemy, and was exhausted. Those who understand it regret his exile. The following is a record of his biography: The Emperor of Abyssinia was born on July 23, 1891, and is the great-grandson of former Emperor Sahle Selassie (Sahle Selassie died in 1847). His father, General Makonnen, was a great general under Emperor Menelik the Great. The Emperor entered the capital as a child and grew up in Emperor Menelik the Great's palace, and was greatly loved by the Emperor. After graduating from Addis Ababa Middle School, he was appointed Governor of Sidamo Province, still a teenager. Later, he inherited his father's title and received a salary in the city of Harar. During his tenure as Governor of Sidamo Province, his politics were honest, benevolent, and loving to the people, and his reputation was well-known in the country. When Emperor Menelik the Great died, his grandson Iyasu succeeded to the throne. He was mediocre and incompetent, and lost the hearts of the people. In 1916, Iyasu was deposed, and the Emperor assumed the title of Regent and exercised the functions of head of state. On October 6 of the following year, the people of the country honored Zawditu, the daughter of Emperor Menelik the Great, as Empress. The current Emperor was promoted to Regent and Crown Prince. The government was in one person's hands, and the whole country was obedient. In September 1928, he was promoted to the title of King, and on October 7 of the same year, he performed the ceremony of receiving the title. Two years later, Empress Zawditu died, leaving a will for the Crown Prince to inherit the throne. He ascended the throne in the same year and honored the Emperor. On November 2 of the same year, he performed the coronation ceremony. Since becoming Regent, the Emperor has always traveled abroad. In 1924, he traveled to European countries and returned home via Jerusalem. All major international treaties were signed in his name to increase his status. On March 17, 1923, he joined the League of Nations as a member state. On October 26, 1928, he signed the Pact of Paris. On August 2, 1928, he signed a treaty between Italy and Abyssinia. The Emperor worked diligently and was courageous in his work. He always had an optimistic attitude towards the environment, and all the ministers around him were influenced by his authority and regarded the Emperor as a model. He also quelled rebellions and laid the foundation for peace. In the past, political power was held by the church, but the Emperor gradually recovered it. The Abyssinian Church was originally under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Alexandria, but the Emperor made it independent. The slave system was prevalent in the country, and it was difficult to reverse the situation, but the Emperor did his best to eliminate it. He was also fascinated by Europeanization. Schools were established in large cities to develop the people's intelligence and lay the foundation for innovative politics. England, France, Italy, Belgium, Greece, and other countries have awarded him the highest medals, which are too numerous to mention. The Empress Waizero Menen was married in 1911 and had three sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Prince Asfaw Wossen, was born on July 27, 1916, and is now the Crown Prince. The second son, Prince Makonnen, was born in 1923. The third son, Prince Sahle Selassie, was born in 1931. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany and Manchukuo Conclude a Commercial Agreement; Effective June This Year for a Term of One Year; Head of German Economic Delegation Comes to China from Japan; Will Visit Chinese Government Authorities to Explain</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The commercial agreement between Germany and "Manchukuo" was signed on April 30 this year and will take effect on June 1 this year for a term of one year. The content stipulates that 75 percent of the value of goods such as soybeans and wool exported from "Manchukuo" to Germany shall be paid by Germany in foreign currency, and the remaining 25 percent shall be paid in marks. The quantity of goods exported from Germany to "Manchukuo" shall be limited to the amount of its imports and shall not exceed it. Financial figures recently stated that in the past, Germany paid all foreign currency for goods imported from "Manchukuo." In the future, a quarter of it can be paid in marks, which can promote bilateral commercial relations. The semi-official "Political Foreign Communication Report" stated that this agreement is of great importance, but its nature is only a technical agreement. It is not accurate to say that it has political implications. Tang Liangli, advisor to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, happened to be here to investigate journalism. He recently told a reporter from this agency, "I do not know the details of the terms of this agreement, so I cannot express my opinion. However, I am sure that even if the German government has concluded this agreement, it will not recognize 'Manchukuo' before China. Since the Chinese government is determined not to recognize 'Manchukuo', Germany will certainly not rashly recognize it." (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Dr. Kipp, director of the German Economic Committee, who recently arrived in the Far East, departed today on the postal ship Monrovia. It is understood that he will go to Nanjing to explain to the Chinese government that the commercial agreement concluded with Japan and "Manchukuo" is not malicious to China.

<h3>Balkan Consultation and the Little Entente: Important Meeting Convened in Southern Capital</h3>
<p>Studying the Current European Situation to Consolidate Unity; Coastal Defense Discussions Also on the Agenda</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia – The standing political conference of the Balkan Entente nations is scheduled to convene here on the 4th and 5th of this month. The conference will be chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras. The standing political conference of the Little Entente nations is also scheduled to convene here on the 6th and 7th of this month. The conference will be chaired by Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović. All these meetings are of vital importance. Recent international events, including the developments of the Italian-Ethiopian War, Germany's unilateral abrogation of the Locarno Treaties, and the special interests of the Balkan Entente and Little Entente nations, will all be discussed. Furthermore, since the occurrence of international incidents, advocates for revising the treaties of the European War have become exceedingly vocal. The foreign ministers of the Balkan Entente and Little Entente nations—Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Turkey, and Greece—will consider unified action to cope with the situation. As for the meeting of the Balkan Entente nations, the focus of the foreign ministers of Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Turkey will be on Turkey's request to re-fortify the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits. Regarding this matter, the governments of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Romania have all accepted Turkey's request. Among them, Greece and Romania, due to their direct involvement with the system to be adopted for the straits, will provide special clarifications of their views. In addition, when the public opinion circles of Bulgaria discussed the re-fortification of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, they issued a statement claiming that Bulgaria should enjoy access to the Aegean Sea. When the foreign ministers of the Balkan Entente nations meet, the relations between those nations and Bulgaria, and this claim by Bulgarian public opinion, will undoubtedly be discussed. People in Yugoslavia generally believe that the meetings of the Balkan Entente and Little Entente nations will result in a consensus among all parties. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Athens – The standing political conference of the Balkan Entente nations is scheduled to convene in the capital of Yugoslavia on Monday, May 4th.

Rüştü Aras then visited Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas, as well as former Prime Ministers Tsaldaris and Sophoulis. He departed for Yugoslavia at 4 PM. According to Rüştü Aras's statement to the press, "After Turkey requested the re-fortification of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, all nations have responded positively with their agreement. This matter will be submitted for discussion outside of the League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva and will be formally addressed this summer." Regarding the Balkan Entente nations' conference, it is now known that the agenda includes the following items: issues regarding the military mutual obligations of the Entente nations, issues regarding the re-fortification of the straits, issues regarding the formation of a joint diplomatic front by the respective nations, and the issue of Italy's invasion of Albania (referring to Italy sending tens of thousands of young people to Albania to join the militia, with Italian officers in charge of training). In addition, important European issues are also on the agenda, such as the Rhine River issue, the threat of the annexation of Austria by Germany, Hungary's request to revise borders, and the issue of Hungary and Poland growing closer under Germany's promotion.

<h3>Japanese Three-Minister Conference: Reviewing Policy Towards Russia</h3>
<p>Planning to Resolve Pending Issues Through Diplomacy; Also Considering Strengthening Troops Stationed in Manchuria</p>
<p>Tokyo – The routine meeting of the three ministers of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs was held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 2nd. The content of the meeting focused on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, and the ministers exchanged views on the future of the four-way relationship between China, Japan, the Soviet Union, and "Manchukuo," as well as the fundamental policy towards the Soviet Union. There was extensive discussion regarding issues such as the Manchurian-Mongolian border, the Soviet-Mongolian treaty, the concentration of Soviet troops on the Far Eastern border, and the military preparations of Japan and "Manchukuo" in response. Because the issue of the Soviet Union is the key to determining policy towards China from any perspective, emphasis should be placed on this point in foreign policy. It was decided that the Soviet Union's attitude on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border is deeply regrettable, and Japan cannot remain unconcerned about its concentration of troops in maintaining stability in East Asia. Therefore, while striving to resolve pending issues through diplomatic efforts, consideration will be given to strengthening the troops stationed in Manchuria. (Domei News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Egypt Raises Tariff Barriers</h3>
<p>Major Blow to Japanese Goods Dumping</p>
<p>Opening – A few hours before his death, the former King of Egypt, Fuad, signed an order stipulating a 6% increase in import duties on dyed rayon, a 550% increase on undyed rayon, and a 100% increase on all rayon fabrics. The tax on woolen and textile fabrics has also been increased from 75 milliemes (Egyptian currency) to 150 milliemes per net kilogram. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Japan-Egypt talks, which have continued since last autumn, are now hopeless, as the Japanese delegation has received orders to return home. According to a telegram from Consul Amagi in Alexandria, the Egyptian government has now decided to implement a major tariff reform on 48 kinds of goods, increasing tariffs on silk fabrics, rayon, woolen fabrics, and light bulbs, which are important Japanese exports. This can be seen as a retaliatory measure by the Egyptian government against the Japanese delegation. The future of Japan-Egypt talks is thus quite pessimistic. (Domei News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Germany's Preparations for War (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— by Louis Fischer, Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>Chancellor Hitler made another peace speech on May 21, 1935. Every German I have met recently has used this speech as the basis for Germany's foreign policy. This speech contained two purposes, one of which was to win the friendship of Britain. Three weeks later, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was indeed signed. Hitler needed this quite a bit, and the May 21 speech was an earnest plea for it. The second purpose was hostility towards Bolshevik Russia. Hitler himself attacked Moscow fiercely and unrestrainedly, but the next day the German government granted the Soviet government a long-term loan of 100 million marks. Germany needed Soviet raw materials—oil, manganese, timber, etc.—to get its stalled factories running. Although Moscow knew that commercial interests and political sympathies should be kept separate, it finally did not accept the proposal.</p>
<p>We cannot make a detailed analysis of this speech here. In short, Berlin often contradicts itself. Its fundamental argument is National Socialism's opposition to the collective security system. Hitler said, "When the intertwining of complex international obligations reduces the possibility of localizing wars, tragedies like the First World War can easily occur, and the danger of dragging many countries into a war becomes increasingly apparent." How can a war be localized? Very simple. Hitler proposed, "When such a war breaks out, other countries should immediately withdraw from both sides and not let themselves be bound by treaty obligations, throwing themselves into the whirlpool from the beginning." Specifically, if Germany attacks Czechoslovakia or Austria or Lithuania, other countries, those bound by treaty to aid the invaded, should immediately take a neutral stance and let Germany fight Lithuania or Germany fight Czechoslovakia on their own. Then, let us assume that Hitler swallowed the first piece of meat and then advanced towards Hungary or Yugoslavia. At this time, other countries still do not interfere, ensuring that the war between Germany and its isolated enemy is localized. It would be laughable if anyone really believed Hitler's excuse that Germany is definitely not an aggressor. Let us say that the Soviet Union attacked Poland. The result is assumed to be that Poland succumbs. Then, the deliberately aggressive Moscow may then attack Germany. Wouldn't it be beneficial for Germany if, after Russia defeated Poland, all neighboring countries collectively dealt with her to eliminate her nascent ambitions? If not to prevent the formation of a united front against Germany in future wars, what other strong reason is there against the collective security system? I asked every German I met, but they could not answer. I think there will be no answer. Hitler's speech on May 21, 1935, also demonstrated a fear that Germany has reserved for itself spheres of influence in future wars. The first is Austria. Hitler said he wanted Austria to "decide for itself." A high-ranking German official told me that Germany would soon hold a vote in Austria to determine whether Austria would willingly merge with Germany. Germany has refused to guarantee Austria's territorial integrity. The second is Lithuania. Hitler said on May 25, "We are prepared to conclude non-aggression treaties with all our neighbors, except for Lithuania." But Hitler also said that this exception could be cancelled if Lithuania could abide by the Memel Statute, which guarantees the rights of the German minority. In short, this is a complex issue, and a solution will require a long period. Moreover, Lithuania is still a stepping stone for invading the Soviet border.</p>
<p>The anti-Soviet movement is now extremely popular in Germany. In his recent meeting with the French Ambassador, Francois-Poncet, Hitler spent a great deal of time attacking the Soviet Union. In a three-hour conversation with the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, on December 13 of last year, Hitler spent even more time attacking the Soviet Union. A few weeks ago, Hitler gave a speech to the members of the Sturmabteilung (SA). The main theme of his speech was anti-Sovietism. Pro-Russian arguments cannot be published in German newspapers. To provide intellectual cover for the idea of invading the Soviet Union, vigorous efforts are underway. Some consider this dangerous because they recall Germany's failure in the Great War of 1914-1918, which was due to the Kaiser's failure to adopt Bismarck's pro-Russian policy, but Hitler ignores this. The preparation is not only ideological. An American who held a completely different view from me recently told me in London that although he had no evidence, he was convinced that a German-Japanese alliance had been concluded and was directed against the Soviet Union. Germany is training pilots for Japanese military aircraft. Last December, twenty-six German aviation experts traveled from Italy to Japan. The Japanese delegate to the Naval Conference stayed with Göring for two days on his way to London. Other evidence is too numerous to list.</p>
<p>But perhaps Germany is not preparing for war in 1938, so there will be no immediate changes at present. This is a mistaken and dangerous view. By 1937, 1938, or 1939, Germany will certainly not be in a position to compete alone with the powers. If Germany finds helpers in Japan or Poland or Hungary, that date may be brought forward. There is also the fact that the weaker the hypothetical united front against Germany, the closer the catastrophe of war will come. Many Germans believe that Britain, constrained by Italy and the Far East and fearing air raids on London, will certainly stay out of the next war unless directly threatened. Will Britain fight for Austria, for Czechoslovakia, for Lithuania, just as it did for Abyssinia? The fate of European civilization probably depends on the answer to this question.</p>
<p>Therefore, everything depends on the number of allies Germany can acquire and the size of the range of hypothetical enemies it can eliminate. The most notable goal of German diplomacy at this stage is to separate France from Russia, France from Britain, and Russia from Britain. At the same time, it is striving to closely woo London as a preparation for neutrality. But the most important goal before this must depend on Germany's policy towards Italy. A weakened Italy could make it easier for Germany to gain a foothold in Austria. On the other hand, because they are both dissatisfied with the status quo, Italy may be a helper in the next war. However, Italy can also side with France against Germany. Italy's failure in Abyssinia will inevitably be followed by Mussolini's collapse, which is unfavorable to German fascism, both domestically and abroad. If this setback is accelerated by the League of Nations' collective action, it will become a terrible "warning" to subsequent aggressors. Therefore, Germany is watching the Italian-Ethiopian event with hope, fear, and hesitation. It does not want to anger Britain with words or actions; yet it does not want to alienate Italy. Such "neutrality" is what Germany refers to as evidence of their pacifism. They are waiting to see which way the wind blows.</p>
<p>It is Europe's great fortune that the most tense period caused by Italy's invasion of Abyssinia did not coincide with the most tense period caused by Germany. Otherwise, if these two countries had united, Europe would have been in a complete mess. European politicians feel that the Anglo-Italian-Abyssinian conflict must be resolved before the German problem can mature. Even with an alliance, it is difficult.</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Henan Fengqiu County appeals for relief</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper: We are writing to inform you that since 1933, the Chai Fang, Guan Tai, Shuang Tu and other breaches have occurred one after another in our county, causing widespread flooding. Villages and neighborhoods have been devastated, and more than 100,000 people have lost their livelihoods (estimated to be three-fifths of the county's population). More than 4,000 people have been drowned, and tens of thousands of houses have been washed away. Tens of thousands of livestock have drowned, with a total loss of property amounting to no less than 50-60 million yuan. The survivors are on the verge of death. Although we have received relief from government officials and various charitable organizations, it is like a drop in the bucket. It is now the time of the year when the old grain supply is exhausted and the new harvest is not yet available, causing food prices to skyrocket. The disaster victims are suffering from hunger and disease, and deaths are reported daily. Those who manage to survive are emaciated. The county magistrate, during his inspections, witnessed the suffering and was deeply saddened. If relief is not provided, the old and weak will starve to death, and the strong will be forced to take risks. The situation is dire. We can only telegraph to your esteemed newspaper, requesting that you consider the severity of the disaster and the imminent danger faced by the victims, and appeal for donations to save them. We anxiously await your response. The County Magistrate of Fengqiu County, Henan Province, Yao Jiawang, the Disaster Relief Association, and all other organizations, on behalf of all the disaster victims, bow in gratitude.</p>
<h3>Northern Anhui Highway: Trunk and branch lines completed</h3>
<p>—But long-distance buses have successively ceased operations—</p>
<p>Bengbu correspondence: The transportation industry in northern Anhui has never been well developed. In the past, there were county roads between counties, but they were bumpy, uneven, and difficult to travel on. The provincial government has been actively constructing highways in recent years. Local administrative authorities have also resolutely repaired the existing roads. The Jinpu Line and the highways along the Huai River are now largely in good condition and are served by buses. Compared to the county roads of the past, there has been significant progress. The completed highways north of the Jinpu Line in Anhui Province include: Susih Highway, 100 kilometers long; Suyong Highway, 72 kilometers long; Sumeng Highway, 72 kilometers long; Suwo Highway, 100 kilometers long; Suqi Highway, 38 kilometers long; Susi Highway, 38 kilometers long. Long-distance buses operate on all routes, but with no fixed schedule, which is inconvenient for passengers. To the central area is the Hebei Highway, 177 kilometers long. The long-distance buses that used to operate there were privately owned, but the provincial government took over and now has stopped operation because it was bad business. Furthermore, the Benglin Highway is 30 kilometers long, and the Linsi Highway is 90 kilometers long, but the long-distance buses have also stopped running. To the south is the Chulai Highway, 55 li long; the Chulai Highway is 45 li long; and the Chuwa Highway is 35 li long, and are currently served by private buses. In the Changhuai area, there is the Bengfu Highway, 182 kilometers long; the Bengbo Highway, 90 kilometers long; and the Benghuai Highway, 10 kilometers long. Long and short distance buses are operated by the Bengbu Automobile Unified Business Office. The company currently has only 12 companies and less than 30 buses. Business is in decline, a far cry from the situation six or seven years ago. (27th)</p>

<h3>Chemistry Lectures, Part 1: Teaching Chemistry in Secondary Schools (continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Kezhong, Full-time Translator, National Institute for Compilation and Translation</p>
<p>Regarding the shortcomings and difficulties in compiling books, we have two methods of remedy: First, the previous curriculum standards only had an outline without specific details, leaving a great deal of flexibility. Therefore, although the books compiled appear to have no major deviations from the curriculum standards, the depth of the content and the details covered vary greatly. Therefore, we plan to add a detailed outline to remedy this. This detailed outline should be published before the summer vacation. Second, regarding the review of textbooks, the government will adopt extremely strict measures to eliminate substandard textbooks. The government has always been very cautious in reviewing textbooks, repeatedly reviewing and revising each textbook at least two or three times. In some cases, the number of errors in a single book reached as many as two or three hundred. The reason we go to such lengths to revise and supplement the work of the compilers is to produce more high-quality textbooks. Furthermore, since the new curriculum standards have only recently been published, the number of various textbooks is small. In order to meet the urgent needs of schools, the textbook approval process has been more lenient in the past. Now that the number of published textbooks is increasing day by day, and some chemistry textbooks seem to be getting worse, it is inevitable that we will adopt strict measures to review textbooks. It can also be said that this is a radical remedy.</p>
<p>The fact is that compiling secondary school textbooks is not an easy task. We will set aside those chemistry textbooks not compiled by people specializing in chemistry. Even for those specializing in chemistry: Those with experience in secondary school teaching can compile books that are more suitable for students, but they may be less familiar with new materials. As for books compiled by university chemistry professors or those with equivalent academic qualifications, they are certainly very familiar with the latest developments in chemistry, but they may not be able to properly allocate the depth and detail of the material in a way that matches the situation in secondary schools. Therefore, to compile a good textbook on a subject like chemistry, it is necessary to have one of the following two types of people: First, a university chemistry professor who has conducted substantial research on secondary school chemistry teaching methods; second, a secondary school chemistry teacher who can frequently consult new materials. Textbooks compiled by anyone other than these two types of people are bound to have the problem of "scratching an itch from outside the boot." Therefore, if we want better textbooks to be published, we can only hope that these two types of people will work harder.</p>
<p>Regarding school equipment, there is now a way to remedy the situation. In the past, the school authorities in several provinces were aware of the shortcomings of secondary school science equipment and wanted to replenish it themselves, but they did not know to what extent it should be replenished or how much it would cost, so it was difficult to start. Recently, the Ministry of Education issued equipment standards for secondary schools, listing all the equipment that should be used and its prices in detail, so the education authorities in various provinces can raise funds in advance according to these standards, and the school authorities can follow a fixed standard when increasing their budgets. I believe that in the short term, the chemistry equipment in secondary schools can be expected to improve.</p>
<p>Regarding teachers, we also have a way to remedy the situation. In the past, the biggest problem for teachers was the lack of opportunities for improvement. In the past year or two, the Ministry of Education has issued orders to 16 universities, including National Central University, Sun Yat-sen University, Beiping University, Beijing University, and Beiping Normal University, to hold summer training courses for secondary school science teachers. The teachers who teach in these training courses are all important professors from the universities. In addition to introducing new materials in various subjects, the training courses also discuss secondary school teaching methods. With this summer school system, teachers can gain new chemistry knowledge every year, and their interest in their own teaching can also be more intense.</p>
<p>Regarding the constant changes in standards, the education authorities are aware that this is not a good approach, so the recent revisions to the chemistry curriculum standards have only slightly reduced the study time and slightly increased the experiment time. However, there have been no major changes to the content of the standards. Now that the curriculum standards for various schools below the secondary level have been gradually completed, we believe that these standards will no longer be changed frequently in the future.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are naturally closely related to the quality of students' chemistry skills, but the greatest responsibility lies with the students themselves. Even with suitable textbooks, good teachers, and sufficient equipment, it is useless if students do not know how to study chemistry or do not work hard. Therefore, students should pay special attention to their attitude and methods in learning chemistry. I will now discuss a few points separately:</p>
<p>Regarding the methods of studying chemistry, first, I believe that secondary school students should have a deep understanding of important chemical facts and principles. Although many people say that it is wrong for a person to study by simply memorizing, we must memorize the very basic principles and important facts well, because various laws and principles are universal. Once understood and memorized purely, they can be used to deduce various other things. Laws and principles are like a thread that can connect many facts in a systematic and organized way. Without laws and principles, all facts would be like scattered sand. Therefore, it is necessary for us to understand and memorize laws and principles. In particular, regarding various important chemical facts, two aspects should also be paid special attention to: First, all facts that are interrelated; second, all things that are related to our daily life, we should pay attention to and experience.</p>
<p>Second, we should have a deep understanding of the meaning of important chemical terms or jargon. As the ancient saying goes, "If the name is not correct, then words are not smooth." The same is true in chemistry. If we do not understand the definitions of chemical terms, then it will be difficult for us to have a clear concept of these myriad and complex chemical phenomena. For example, "vaporization" is a very common term in chemistry. If we do not understand the meaning of this term, then we will not understand important chemical phenomena such as combustion and respiration. Therefore, those who study chemistry must pay attention to the meanings of all chemical terms.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address in Hunan: The Purpose of Military Training and the Foundation of National Salvation</h3>
<p>1.  To save the nation, one must first save the people; to save the people, one must first lead by example and eradicate the root of selfishness and self-interest.</p>
<p>2.  The Ten Articles of Training for Soldiers are the spiritual foundation for soldiers to save the nation.</p>
<p>3.  Hoping that the people of Hunan will carry forward the spirit of "loyalty, sincerity, and simplicity" of Zeng and Hu, become the mainstay of the revolution, and complete the mission of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned students from various schools in Changsha on April 28th and gave an address titled "The Purpose of Military Training and the Foundation of National Salvation." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Chairman He, fellow comrades, today I, the Chairman, have come to inspect the Military Training Headquarters. I would like to take this opportunity to explain to you the purpose of our military training and the principles of national salvation.</p>
<p>As you all know, our country has reached a critical point of survival. The purpose of students coming to the Military Training Headquarters for training is to save the nation. To save our country and achieve the purpose of military training, we must first understand what the country is and why our country has been invaded and oppressed by others to the point of such a critical situation. Just as a person needs to know the source of a disease before seeking treatment, otherwise, treating the head when the head aches and treating the foot when the foot hurts, or even seeking medical treatment recklessly when the illness becomes critical, will inevitably lead to more medicine taken, less effective treatment, and even the loss of life. Therefore, to save the nation, we must know the root cause of the country's illness so that we can prescribe the right medicine, bring the dying back to life. Everyone must know what the country is. The fundamental element of the country is the people. The country is the accumulation of the common spirit and will of the people. The ancients said, "The people are the foundation of the state." Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "The country is the accumulation of people." This means that the country is formed by the gathering of people, and the people are the foundation of the country. Therefore, to save the nation, we must first save the people. To cure the root cause of the country's illness, we must first cure the root cause of the people's illness. The so-called root cause of the people's illness does not refer to ordinary physical ailments, nor does it refer to the special mental illnesses of a few people, but to the fundamental problems of the general public in terms of spirit and personality that are related to the rise and fall of the entire nation. What is this problem? Simply put, it is the biggest old problem of the Chinese people in the past: "selfishness and self-interest." Now, most people have an attitude of "sweeping the snow in front of their own doors," only knowing about themselves, only seeking their own comfort and happiness, and no longer caring about the welfare of others and the suffering of fellow compatriots, let alone knowing about the shame of the country. Therefore, they do not know how to love, help, and cooperate with others and their fellow compatriots. They even have no compassion or sympathy when they see their own compatriots suffering, and they do not know that they should do everything in their power to rescue them. For example, when they see someone on the road unable to carry a load, unable to push a cart, or even drowning in the water or collapsing on the ground, they stand by and watch indifferently, not knowing the obligations of mutual assistance and rescue between compatriots, not knowing that all citizens of the Republic of China are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, our own fellow brothers and sisters. When they see anyone in any distress, we should do everything in our power to help them. We should always regard the hunger and drowning of others as our own hunger and drowning, and rescue others in danger as rescuing ourselves in danger. Furthermore, based on the spirit of self-restraint and love for others, we should achieve what the ancients said, "Being public and forgetting self, being patriotic and forgetting family." Only then can we be considered a true modern citizen. Our ancestors were able to promote this virtue, so the nation was able to achieve civilization and prosperity and endure for a long time. Now, because most people have lost this inherent virtue and cannot love and help each other, they cannot unite their spirits and concentrate their strength. Therefore, although we have 400 million compatriots, everyone is selfish and self-interested, and they do not care for each other, like a heap of loose sand. Everyone, think about it, if our 400 million people are truly of one heart and one mind, united as one, like a big iron ball, how great would that power be? How could there be any reason why the country could not be saved? Conversely, if everyone is still selfish and self-interested and cannot unite and love the country, like a heap of loose sand, what power is there? How can a country like a heap of loose sand not become poorer and weaker day by day? How can it not be invaded and oppressed by foreigners, and finally perish? Therefore, everyone must know that although we have vast lands, abundant resources, and a large population, although we have a long and glorious history and culture, if everyone is still selfish and self-interested and lacks the concept of the nation and the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, the country will not be saved in the end. Now that our country has reached such a critical point of survival and our compatriots are suffering so terribly, if we still cannot eradicate all selfish and self-interested thoughts and habits and strive to become strong in time, then in the future, when the country is destroyed, we ourselves and our descendants will all become slaves and beasts of burden for others. How can we face our ancestors and parents above, and our fellow compatriots and our descendants below? This passage is what we must do from now on. To save the nation, we must first eradicate selfishness and self-interest. I hope everyone will truly understand this principle. Secondly, everyone must also understand that now is the best opportunity for us to work hard, make achievements, and establish a career. The ancients said, "The times make heroes." Today's China is precisely the era for making heroes. What a glorious and great undertaking it will be to save and revive such a poor, weak, and dangerous country and such a deeply shamed and pained nation from our hands in the future! Especially you comrades in Hunan should resolutely take the great responsibility of saving the nation and reviving the nation as your own responsibility. The ancients said, "Even though Chu has only three households, Chu will surely destroy Qin." I believe that the people of Hunan do have this spirit and courage. Without going too far back, just looking at the facts of the last century, such as Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi, because they were in different times and environments, and without commenting on their loyalty to the Qing Dynasty for the sake of defending Taoism and protecting education, just speaking from the perspective of the national situation at that time and the spirit they showed and the undertakings they carried out, they are worthy of our admiration and can be a model for you comrades in Hunan to emulate. At that time, on the one hand, there was the internal trouble of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and the provinces in the Yangtze River basin were almost completely lost. On the other hand, there was the external trouble of the oppression and invasion of Britain and France, which was always in a critical situation. At that time, it was because of you Hunan people, Zeng Guofan, Hu Linyi, and Zuo Zongtang, these heroes and sages, who were able to rise up in time, work hard and become heroes, that they turned the tide, relieved the suffering of the general public, and saved the provinces in the Pearl River and Yangtze River basins, which were almost all lost, with only Hunan being able to preserve itself and using Hunan as the backbone and base to finally save the situation and turn the country from danger to safety. These sages are our models for saving the nation. Today, I, the Chairman, am speaking to you comrades, and I hope that everyone will take the spirit of Zeng and Hu as the law, shoulder the important responsibility of saving the nation and reviving the nation, use your Hunan as the pillar in the middle of the stream, and let you, the young students, be the virtuous and heroic figures in the revival of the nation. We can believe that as long as everyone can establish great ambitions, cultivate morality, work hard and strive to become strong, there is no danger that cannot be overcome and no country that cannot be saved. Zeng and Hu were able to accomplish a great undertaking in such a difficult environment at that time. According to the principle of the evolution of the times, our future achievements will not only not be inferior to Zeng and Hu, but will also be several times greater than their success.</p>
<p>I have already explained the danger of the country and the root cause of the illness, as well as the responsibility we should bear to save the nation. But if we only understand this principle and do not have a true spirit to serve as the foundation for saving the nation, no matter how great our abilities, we will still not be able to save the nation. Just like the sages Zeng and Hu, the basic spirit of their saving the nation at that time was to promote China's inherent principle, which is the doctrine of Confucius and Mencius. What they advocated was a kind of "loyalty, sincerity, and simplicity" of personality. Everyone knows that Zeng and Hu were just scholars, and everything about them was very ordinary. They originally did not have much ability. Even in terms of writing, there were many people at that time who were equal to them. Why were Zeng and Hu able to come out to correct people's hearts, shift the social atmosphere, and accomplish a great undertaking of restoring order and saving the nation and the people? The most important point is that they were able to advocate honesty, trustworthiness, sincerity, simplicity (that is, being realistic) to the world by leading by example, and they taught their students and their children in this way. The people they taught all worked together to save the nation, so they were able to save such a dying country. Therefore, it can be seen that saving the nation is not difficult. As long as we restore the inherent principle of our ancestors, no matter what national crisis, we can turn it from danger to safety and make it turn from weak to strong. Now we have more than 2,000 students gathered here for training. Everyone has the same goals and aspirations and encourages each other. The progress of the times and the goodness of the opportunity are at least dozens of times better than the situation of Zeng and Hu at that time. As long as we can truly promote the revolutionary spirit of our Prime Minister and enhance our inherent morality, we will definitely be able to save the nation and definitely be able to revive the nation. What is the foundation of our saving the nation now? I have already explained that the root cause of the crisis in our country is selfishness and self-interest. Therefore, it can be seen that the spirit of our saving the nation is the opposite of selfishness and self-interest. The ancient saying "harming oneself to benefit others" is a motto. The meaning of this saying is that if we want to make a revolution, we must sacrifice ourselves for the country and the people. The Ten Articles of Training for Soldiers recently promulgated by the central government are based on this spirit of saving the nation. The training is the foundation for our soldiers, students, and the general public to save the nation and the people. Now I will read the Ten Articles of Training aloud for everyone to hear. The first article is to implement the Three Principles of the People, defend the country, and not allow any behavior of violation or negligence.</p>
<p>The second article is to support the National Government, obey superiors, and not allow any behavior of hypocrisy or betrayal.</p>
<p>The third article is to respect and love fellow soldiers, protect the people, and not allow any behavior of arrogance or rudeness.</p>
<p>The fourth article is to be loyal to one's duty and carry out orders, and not allow any behavior of delay or cowardice.</p>
<p>The fifth article is to strictly abide by discipline, be brave and decisive, and not allow any behavior of abandonment or perfunctoriness.</p>
<p>The sixth article is to unite in spirit and be united in action, and not allow any behavior of dispersion or shirking responsibility.</p>
<p>The seventh article is to be responsible and know shame, and to advocate martial virtue, and not allow any behavior of humiliation or greed.</p>
<p>The eighth article is to be hardworking and endure hardship, and to be thrifty and simple, and not allow any behavior of luxury or frivolity.</p>
<p>The ninth article is to pay attention to etiquette and tidy up one's appearance, and not allow any behavior of licentiousness or unrestrainedness.</p>
<p>The tenth article is to sincerely cultivate oneself and steadfastly abide by trust and righteousness, and not allow any behavior of baseness, deceit, or falsehood.</p>
<p>Just now I explained that the general root cause of the Chinese people's illness is selfishness and self-interest. Because of their selfishness and self-interest, they only know themselves and do not care about others, so they commit all kinds of base, deceitful, and hypocritical behaviors. Because of selfishness and self-interest, they do not care about social morality, so there is licentious and unrestrained behavior. They do not realize even when they lose their lives and the country. Because of selfishness and self-interest, they are extravagant, lazy, greedy, cowardly, undisciplined, irresponsible, ignorant of etiquette, ignorant of shame, do not abide by discipline, and do not learn martial arts. Therefore, they cannot unite their spirits, concentrate their strength, cannot be hardworking and endure hardship, be thrifty and simple, cannot be loyal to their duties, carry out orders, cannot respect and love their fellow soldiers, protect the people, cannot implement the Three Principles of the People, and defend the country. These were the problems of the general soldiers in the past. Soldiers are the current citizens, the current youth, so the problems of soldiers can also be said to be the problems of the general citizens and the general youth. If we, the general youth, are determined to save the country, we must start with ourselves, and truly eradicate all the bad behaviors that are not allowed in the training of soldiers. From now on, we must implement the Three Principles of the People in ourselves, support our own National Government, obey our superiors, respect and love our fellow soldiers, protect our people, strictly abide by discipline, be brave and decisive, and be loyal to our duties, carry out orders, unite in spirit, be united in action, be responsible and know shame, advocate martial virtue, be hardworking and endure hardship, be thrifty and simple, pay attention to etiquette, tidy up our appearance, in short, we must sincerely cultivate ourselves, steadfastly abide by trust and righteousness, unify our will, unite our spirit, and implement the Three Principles of the People to achieve the goal of saving the country and the people. We must encourage ourselves and others with this, and truly achieve it, so that we can be modern citizens and promote the spirit of the sages Zeng and Hu. In this way, the excellence of the times and environment in which we live and the achievements we will achieve in the future will certainly be greater and more glorious than those of Zeng and Hu. If all the comrades present today can do what Zeng and Hu did in the future, then your Hunan will have not only one Zeng Wenzheng, but also thousands of Zeng Wenzheng. In this way, how powerful will your strength be? What national crisis can you not break? What country can you not save? Only in this way can you be worthy of being descendants of the Yellow Emperor, worthy of being citizens of the Republic of China, and worthy of being students of our Military Training Corps.</p>
<p>Today, I, the Chairman, use this to encourage our young military training students, and also use this to encourage all comrades and compatriots in Hunan. I hope that everyone, under the leadership of Chairman He, will unite in spirit, be united in action, love each other, and strive hard. Everyone must also establish ambitions, take care of your health, temper your spirit, constantly strive to become stronger, create the foundation for saving the country, and complete the mission of the revolution.

<h3>Military Suppression of Bandits in Fujian Province: Preliminary Work Completed</h3>
<p>Total Encirclement and Suppression Will Now Commence. Many "Big Sword Society" Bandits and Other Bandits Have Been Executed.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The situation of bandit suppression in Fujian Province has made considerable progress recently. However, due to the changes in the bandit situation, the plans for military suppression have also changed accordingly. It is learned that the military search and suppression in various pacification zones has been initially completed. After discussions between Jiang Dingwen, Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Fujian, and Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression in the Border Areas of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, it was decided to commence a total encirclement and suppression immediately, with the aim of annihilating all the remaining bandits within the province and in the border areas of neighboring provinces in one fell swoop, thereby avoiding the complexity of piecemeal solutions. All units have been instructed to act swiftly and promptly respond to the situation. Furthermore, Yang Huisheng, Xie Renzi, and other leaders of the "Big Sword Society" bandits who caused trouble in the territories of Jian'ou and Shunchang counties last winter, colluded with the remnants of Huang Ligui's forces, and carried out rampant looting in the Jian'ou and Shunchang areas, causing unbearable suffering to the villagers. In February of this year, the troops stationed in Jian'ou, Jianyang, Shunchang, Nanping, and Shaowu counties jointly encircled and suppressed the remnants of Huang Ligui's bandits and the local "Big Sword Society" bandits. The "Big Sword Society" bandits were weak and vulnerable, and after suffering heavy losses, they voluntarily surrendered and sought amnesty. The 56th Division sent personnel to Fangcun, Lanxia, and other villages to verify their identities. Unexpectedly, some of them refused to be verified and even killed a company commander of the 56th Division. The division headquarters immediately executed the important bandits who had already been identified and registered, including Yang Huisheng, Xie Renzi, Xie Shunnu, Xie Guinu, and 58 others. The rest are still being pursued. It was discovered that Xie Shunnu, Wang Huomu, and several others were the main culprits who robbed the Yangkou remittance office of the Xin Tai Bank last winter. After the case was solved, Xie and others escaped into the mountains and became bandits. This time, Xie Shunnu and his five sons were executed at the same time, but Wang Huoyu managed to escape.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Shanxi Provinces: Exchange and Promotion of Products</h3>
<p>Methods Have Been Established, and Categories for Exchange and Sale Have Been Designated. Guangdong Will Transport Manufactured Goods, and Shanxi Will Supply Raw Materials. All Miscellaneous Taxes Will Be Exempted Except for National Taxes.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The products manufactured by various provincial-run factories in Guangdong Province recently have surpluses available for sale within the country, in addition to supplying the province. The products of the sugar factories, silk weaving factories, etc., are being planned to be sold to other provinces. Appropriately, steel plants, hydroelectric power plants, etc., are about to be established, which will require large amounts of coal and minerals in the future. Cement plants need gypsum, and silk weaving factories need wool and cotton. If these raw materials are purchased from foreign countries, not only will profits flow overseas, but there is also the risk of supply interruptions. Looking around the country, Shanxi Province has relatively abundant production of minerals and industrial raw materials, and most of the raw materials needed by Guangdong's factories can be supplied by Shanxi Province. At the same time, Shanxi Province needs industrial products, which can also be supplied by Guangdong Province's factories. For economic reasons and for the sake of domestic trade, Guangdong and Shanxi provinces have exchanged telegrams to discuss methods for exchanging products. Last month, Yan Xishan of Shanxi sent representatives south to implement the exchange and promotion of specialty products between the two provinces. Recently, representatives of the two provinces have drafted an agreement. After further revisions by the two provincial governments, a formal contract can be signed. From the date of signing the contract, the exchange and promotion of specialty products between the two provinces will be implemented. The methods for exchanging and promoting specialty products between the two provinces are recorded below:</p>
<p>The items for mutual exchange and promotion between Shanxi and Guangdong provinces are temporarily limited to the following categories. However, if it is deemed necessary to add items, the responsible agencies designated by the Shanxi and Guangdong provincial governments for this type of product exchange and promotion may jointly add them at any time. The temporarily designated items for exchange and promotion are as follows: (A) Items to be supplied by Shanxi Province to Guangdong Province for exchange: coal, cotton, wool, fur goods, medicinal materials, walnuts, wine, gypsum; (B) Items to be supplied by Guangdong Province to Shanxi Province for exchange: sugar, silk, silk fabrics, linen fabrics, sulfuric acid, soda, aquatic products. For all exchange items designated in this method, the provincial governments of both parties shall designate agencies as general management offices to wholesale and act as agents for various merchants. All exchange items listed in this method shall be exempt from all miscellaneous taxes upon import into the purchasing province, except for national taxes. The purchasing party for all exchange items listed in this method may determine the selling price, but only to the extent that it does not hinder the sale of the supplying party's items. For all exchange items listed in this method, the supplying party shall be responsible for transporting them to the designated warehouse at the location of the receiving party's management agency. All national taxes, transportation costs, insurance fees, loading and unloading fees, etc., shall be borne by the supplying party. For the transaction of all specialty products listed in this method, the purchasing party shall first specify the goods and quantities to be purchased based on the samples provided by the supplying party. After both parties agree on the price, the purchasing party shall notify the supplying party in writing to proceed accordingly and transport the goods to the purchasing party for acceptance. The designated agencies managing the exchange items listed in this method shall each send one representative to reside at the location of the other party's agency to handle matters such as procurement, price negotiation, and inspection. All expenses required by the representatives shall be borne by the agency they represent. All promotional expenses required by the purchasing party for the exchange items listed in this method shall be borne by the purchasing party. For items ordered by the managing agencies of both parties, the supplying party shall deliver the goods according to the samples specified by the purchasing party when ordering; otherwise, the purchasing party may refuse to accept the goods, and any losses incurred as a result shall be borne by the supplying party. The value of the items exchanged by both parties shall be approximately equal every two months, and the amount shall be calculated once every two months. If the difference is less than 2,000 yuan, it shall be equalized next time. If it exceeds 2,000 yuan, the debtor shall purchase a remittance bill from the Bank of China to settle the account. The price of the exchange items listed in this method shall be calculated in central legal tender. The term of this method is temporarily set at one year. If both parties agree upon expiration, it may be extended. However, the contracting party shall notify the other party in writing three months before the expiration. Any matters not covered in this method shall be added when the contract is signed. This method shall take effect from the date when the representatives appointed by the Shanxi and Guangdong provincial governments sign the contract and submit it to the respective provincial governments for approval.</p>

<h3>The Two Zhejiang Salt Districts: An Inspection Team Drafts a Remedial Plan</h3>
<p>A Hangzhou dispatch: The Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Audit Office dispatched an inspection and design team for the Two Zhejiang Salt Districts, headed by Zeng Yangfeng, with members Yang Xingqin, Huang Botang, Wu Shangzhi, Sun Bangzao, along with Tang Rongtao from the Two Zhejiang Audit Office, Zhang Zhongli, the head of the Tax Police Bureau, engineer Zhong Hong, and others, a total of eight people. Last month, they went to various salt fields for inspection, thoroughly touring twenty-three locations in various parts of eastern Zhejiang. They returned to Hangzhou the day before yesterday and held a meeting at the Two Zhejiang Audit Office branch. The team leader, Zeng Yangfeng, reported and discussed the inspection situation and proposed remedial measures. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>The Difficulties of Salt Field Management: Zhejiang Province has a coastline of 505 kilometers, with salt fields scattered like stars, extremely dispersed. The entire area is divided into twenty-three fields, each further divided into five or six sections, or even dozens. Therefore, there are hundreds of salt production sites. Although the yield at each site is not very high, if not managed, the leakage of illicit salt is considerable. According to the current situation, it is estimated that illicit salt in the Two Zhejiang districts reaches over one million dan per year. This is completely different from Changlu and Huaibei. Although the salt production in each of those districts reaches six or seven million dan per year, the salt fields are concentrated, making management easier. In contrast, the Two Zhejiang districts produce only about four million dan per year, but with hundreds of production sites, management is extremely difficult. Complete construction would require huge sums of money. This is due to the terrain. The Two Zhejiang districts cannot be compared with Changlu and Huaibei. However, since the establishment of the Audit Office in the second year of the Republic [1913], there has been significant progress in salt affairs in the Two Zhejiang districts. In that year, the district's tax revenue was only over two million yuan, and the salt release was only over 600,000 dan. After gradual improvements by the Audit Office, both tax revenue and salt release increased annually. By the twentieth year of the Republic [1931], tax revenue had reached over nine million yuan, and salt release had reached 3.5 million dan. In the last two years, tax revenue and salt release have declined slightly, due to various reasons. In the twenty-third year of the Republic [1934], the market scale was changed, and salt prices rose sharply. In addition, Zhejiang Province experienced a severe drought that year, leading to abundant salt production, rural bankruptcy, and weakened purchasing power, resulting in a flood of private sales. This situation is not unique to the Two Zhejiang districts; the Changlu and Shandong districts are also the same. Therefore, in areas with dispersed salt fields and abundant local salt, salt prices should not be too high. Otherwise, not only will there be no increase in revenue, but even the existing tax revenue may be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Uneven Tax Rates: The salt tax rates in the Two Zhejiang districts vary greatly, with more than ten different rates. The purpose of the low tax rates was originally to cultivate the habit of local people consuming government salt. Therefore, the closer to the salt field, the lower the tax rate. The intention was good, but since the tax rates are not equal, it is inevitable that light taxes encroach on heavy taxes. If tax police use force to seize, then the expenses of combating smuggling must increase. As a result, defenses are set up everywhere, and with many defenses, the strength is weak, resulting in more losses than gains. Moreover, low-tax salt is often transported by unscrupulous merchants to heavy-tax areas to seek huge profits. The public must pay according to the official price, failing to enjoy the benefits of the low tax rate. This causes a great loss to national tax revenue and also increases many difficulties in salt affairs management. From this, we can see that merely implementing low taxes to cultivate the habit of local people consuming government salt is difficult to achieve. The fundamental solution lies in managing field production and balancing tax rates.</p>
<p>The Situation of Personnel Handling Affairs: At present, the responsible persons of important weighing and releasing agencies, such as those in Wenzhou, Taizhou, Yuyao, Dinghai, and Nansha, are mostly honest and capable. However, lower-level personnel lack motivation. Tax police are inferior to those in Changlu and Huaibei, but have made progress compared to the former anti-smuggling camp era. Various bad habits have been eliminated. However, local officials lack experience and rarely achieve good results. Therefore, when reorganizing salt affairs in the Two Zhejiang districts, considerable attention must be paid to personnel matters.</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan: The reorganization will consist of the following: (A) Management of salt fields: The production and storage of salt must be centralized for easy management. Since the implementation of the consolidation method in Dinghai Field, the results have been remarkable, and all fields should follow suit. However, the construction of these storage facilities must conform to scientific and economic principles and must be established throughout each field, no more than three li from the beach, so that salt production can be consolidated without difficulty. The structure can use simple local methods for easy equipment and avoid waste. According to the current situation, there are many sea dikes in each field. Salt production and storage can be concentrated in sections near the sea dikes. The sea dikes can be leveled and widened to serve as inspection lines to prevent smuggling. Where there are no dikes, wire mesh or trenches can be set up to replace them. At the same time, simple tax police stations and field offices should be built in areas with concentrated salt production, connected by telephone lines, to communicate information and facilitate anti-smuggling efforts. (B) Organize loans for salt workers: The salt workers in the Two Zhejiang districts are extremely poor and are usually heavily exploited by Pengzhang and Duizhang. Their suffering is deep. Contact should be made with the banking sector to organize loans for salt workers, using the consolidated salt as collateral. However, the interest rate charged to salt workers should be slightly lower than usual, not exceeding three or four percent. The government should subsidize the banks for the loss of interest. (C) Abolish unusable salt fields: For the sake of reorganizing salt affairs and considering the livelihoods of salt workers, unusable salt fields should be abolished and converted from salt production to cultivation. The government should raise funds to build dikes for freshwater cultivation, purchase and distribute seeds, so that salt workers can switch to agriculture, benefiting both national salt policy and the livelihoods of salt workers. (D) At the same time, production periods must be stipulated so that salt workers know the amount they should produce each year. The maximum amount sold is only a little over 3 million dan. Overproduction and under-selling are due to the prevalence of illicit salt. If salt fields are strictly managed, illicit salt cannot leave the field, and official sales can increase by one million dan, so that supply and demand are balanced. Furthermore, if salt consolidation and low-interest loans can be implemented simultaneously, field prices can be maintained, and salt workers do not have to sell at discounted prices secretly. Not only can the government collect an additional five million yuan in taxes each year, but also the economic oppression suffered by salt workers can be alleviated. (E) Average tax rates: After salt field management, the entire region's tax rates should be averaged and gradually balanced. Unscrupulous merchants will find it difficult to profit, and the burden on the people will be reduced. (F) Eliminate inferior personnel: Lower-level work is the most important. Vigorous, young individuals should be given proper training and employed according to their abilities. Incompetent weighing and releasing personnel and tax police officers should be eliminated without favoritism. (G) Train tax police: According to current needs, two-thirds of the tax police should be stationed in the production areas, and one-third in the heavy tax sales areas, to prevent encroachment by light tax salt. The original commercial patrol should be thoroughly reorganized and merged with the tax police to supplement police strength. At the same time, a tax police training class should be established, and teams should be dispatched in batches for training, so that all officers and police in the region are trained.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: House Tax Collection Begins</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the police district system in this county, expenses have increased sharply. It is not enough to rely on other means to make up for the deficit. The county government immediately began to reorganize the house tax, dividing it into housing tax and shop tax. The preparatory work has now been completed, and collection personnel have been dispatched starting from the first of the month.</p>
<h3>Labor Service in Various Districts Completed</h3>
<p>The labor service in the eight districts of this county has successively mobilized able-bodied men to complete the general mobilization work such as building dikes and repairing rural roads. It has been submitted to the county government for inspection and acceptance. A special commissioner from the provincial committee for inspecting labor service will come to Kunshan for inspection within days.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Rural Woman Gives Birth to a Monstrous Fetus</h3>
<p>Yang Fulong, a resident of Jiangjuanshang, Yuanji Township, Second District, is thirty-four years old and makes a living as a mourner. His wife, Wu, is about the same age and has a daughter who is only two years old. Last summer, she became pregnant again. At the beginning of this month, she reached full term and gave birth after excruciating abdominal pain. The midwife wrapped it up, and upon closer inspection, she was stunned. The child's head had no eyes, only two small holes, shaped like small soybeans. The whole body was covered with stiff fetal hair like silver needles, and the hair was more than two chi long. Fulong was very surprised to see it. Villagers who heard about it came to see it one after another, wearing down the threshold. Everyone praised it as a miracle. According to Fulong, the child cries softly from time to time, and raising it to adulthood would make it a useless person. Thinking it was an ominous sign for the family, he planned to bury it alive.</p>
<h3>Villagers Destroy the Fifth District Office</h3>
<p>Since construction began on the dam at Sitou River, Fifth District, on March 21, it has been delayed due to unpredictable weather and two collapses. About 2,000 conscripted farmers are currently working at the Sitou Bell. However, the water pavilions in the lower bank area of ​​the town obstruct traffic. District Chief Jiang Zhizhong persuaded them to demolish them voluntarily, but each resident delayed, hoping to preserve them. At 3:00 PM on the 2nd, the conscripted workers demolished them on their behalf, starting with the demolition of Zheng Apei's water pavilion, causing disputes with residents. The workers detained Gao Jinbao and took him to the district office for evaluation. The workers were very angry and crowded to the district office to demand his release, destroying desks, chairs, and miscellaneous items. The local security team and the patrol officers from the Yeqiao Fifth Branch Station rushed to suppress them, so no major disaster occurred. On the 3rd, District Chief Jiang reported the situation to the county government for instructions.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: County Chamber of Commerce Postpones Re-election</h3>
<p>The terms of the executive and supervisory committee members of the Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce expired long ago. Preparations for the re-election have been underway for several months. The general meeting of members was originally scheduled for May 15 to re-elect officers. However, because the procedures were not yet complete, a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees was held on the afternoon of the 2nd, chaired by Xu Juxi. It was proposed that the re-election of various guilds was not yet complete, so the date for reviewing the qualifications of representatives could not be determined. It was decided that the members' meeting should be postponed to June 1, and the date for reviewing the qualifications of representatives should be set from May 11 to 15. Members were notified on May 16 that representatives from various guilds should report before May 10, otherwise they would be deemed to have given up their qualifications.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Province Still Has 50-60% of Rice in Stock</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce previously received letters from the Wujiang and other chambers of commerce, stating that the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce intended to jointly purchase foreign rice with Shanghai merchants, requesting the Ministry to issue free passports and asking for a ban. The Chamber of Commerce immediately reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance. Recently, it received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, Fuzi No. 4031, stating, "After investigation, this Ministry has not issued any tax-free passports for foreign rice. However, since the telegram states that Jiangsu Province still has 50-60% of rice in stock, if foreign rice is dumped, it will certainly seize the rice and grain market, which is related to the economic problems of rural areas. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been consulted to pay attention to prevention at any time."</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Sports Field Organizes Morning Exercise Class</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Public Sports Field is organizing a morning exercise training class. The rules have now been set, and people are being recruited to participate. The number of people is temporarily set at 30. The training period is from May 20 to June 20, held every morning at 7:30. Prizes will be prepared for those with excellent results as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Some Rioters in Shazhou Captured</h3>
<p>The rioters in Shazhou City, Seventh District, obstructed river construction, opened river embankments, and destroyed the township head's residence and its hospital. Initially, the county government could not deal with it because the rioters often gathered hundreds of people and had firearms. The leaders captured, Tan Jiujin and others, were also robbed back midway. After the Commissioner's Office sent personnel to Changshu for investigation, it instructed the secret dispatch of security teams to cooperate with the Public Security Bureau's police teams, divided into several small teams, to go to the countryside, determine the date, and use an encirclement strategy to capture the rioters. Subsequently, the team was divided into four small teams to secretly go to the countryside in advance and surrounded and searched on the evening of the 30th. Unexpectedly, the rioters were still prepared and surrounded the first team, fiercely attacking them with iron hoes. Some even opened fire. The other teams learned of this, and with a larger encirclement strategy, they rescued the first team and arrested rioters Xu Dafu, Ju Jinrong, Lu Hongyi, Zhu Shuiguan and others, as well as gongs, iron hoes and other weapons. However, the leaders have not yet been captured. The captured criminals are being sent to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Primary School Student Wrongly Accused and Writes Suicide Note</h3>
<p>A primary school student was suddenly found to have committed suicide by poisoning in room 19 of the China Hotel outside the South Gate. Fortunately, a note was left, revealing the name Zhang Ziruo, from Wengjiazhuang, studying at Yuyang Primary School in the city. The hotel immediately sent a waiter to notify the school, causing shock. It was then discovered that the reason for the suicide was that a light bulb was lost in the literacy class for the masses attached to the school. Teacher Cai Deru accused the student of taking it, beat his palms, and reported to the principal to expel him from school. Zhang Ziruo, containing the wronged accusation, was deeply stimulated and had to find another way out: "Goodbye, everyone, unless it's on the road to the Yellow Springs." After the letter was discovered, the school initially did not pay attention until the hotel sent someone to report, realizing that something was wrong. They immediately sent someone to the hotel to send Zhang Ziruo to the hospital for treatment and notified his family. It is said that Zhang is seventeen years old and studying in the sixth grade of the school. This time, humiliated, he swallowed three smoke bubbles, and his life is now in great danger.</p>
<h3>Paper Shop Bankrupt with a Loss of Over 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yongshunyuan Paper Shop on Siqian Street, opened by Wang Weisan for over twenty years, suddenly went bankrupt on the first of this month. It is said that the loss reached more than 50,000 yuan. The shop had suffered three fires, all of which were completely destroyed. Although it is still struggling to stay open, the market is sluggish, and the original vitality has not recovered, making it difficult to maintain. The accumulated losses over the years have reached such a huge amount. It is said that the distribution to creditors will be less than 20%.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Suppression of Bandits in Dapan Mountain</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that Dapan Mountain in eastern Zhejiang is located on the border of Dongyang, Yongkang, and Jinyun counties, and that bandits led by Liu Ying and Huang Fuwu once invaded and disturbed the local area last year, specially established the Dapan Mountain Area Bandit Suppression Commissioner's Office, appointing Huang Mingyuan as the commissioner, responsible for bandit suppression work. After disguising to search and arrest the remaining bandits and holding a bandit suppression meeting, it was decided to clear the bandits and restore the countryside. As the mountain's main products are medicinal products and timber, transportation difficulties have led to the farmers' livelihoods becoming increasingly desperate. In the future, efforts will be made to develop transportation and promote local products to improve the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engine and Freight Cars Arrive in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Yunan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, freight transport has been extremely congested. The lack of freight cars has been insufficient, resulting in mountains of inventory. To facilitate transportation, a large number of more than seventy freight cars have been ordered and transported to Hangzhou one after another. Six new locomotives have been transported and installed and will begin transporting goods on the Yunan section starting today to facilitate commercial transport.</p>

<p>Draft Constitution to Be Announced on the 5th</p>
<p>According to him, the draft constitution will be announced on May 5, and the organizational law and representative election law of the National Congress have also been passed and can be announced simultaneously within days. This decision to draft a constitution has taken three and a half years. There were seven drafts, and the opinions contributed by all parties were adopted one by one. The characteristic of our country's constitution is that it is based on the Three Principles of the People, and the government organization is based on the Premier's instructions and adopts the five-power system. As for the date of implementation of the constitution, it will have to be decided by the National Congress.</p>

This decision to convene the National Congress is the National Congress that formulates the constitution. The National Congress must originally be convened in accordance with the constitution, so it is stipulated in the draft constitution that "the powers of the first National Congress shall be exercised by the National Congress that formulates the constitution." Therefore, this decision is the National Congress that formulates the constitution, so the members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees are all ex officio representatives, and the organizational law and representative election law of the future National Congress must be re-drafted.</p>
<p>Relief of Rural Areas Currently Under Study</p>
<p>According to the Premier's instructions, the party exercises political power during the period of political tutelage. After the implementation of the constitution, the Kuomintang will naturally still exist, but its form and status will change. The plan for rural relief is currently being studied by Liang Hancao and others. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the Central Committee for adoption and implementation. Sun did not want to express his opinion on the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact, only saying that he had not heard of it.</p>

<h3>Narcotics Suppression Commissioner's Office Officially Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Citywide Crackdown on Drug Use to Begin in Ten Days</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Narcotics Suppression Commissioner's Office for Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City, under the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, and concurrently the registration commissioner for reporting smokers, was officially established yesterday at No. 18 Jiangyin Street in the Nanshi district, after Commissioner Ma Liang personally came to Shanghai to prepare for its establishment. Ma left Shanghai for Zhenjiang last night and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in a week. Bian Chi will handle the citywide crackdown on drug use, which will begin on the 10th. The Shanghai Anti-Smoking Association and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau are actively preparing everything. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Office Begins Operations</p>
<p>Since the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government appointed Ma Liang, a member of the National Anti-Smoking Association, as the registration commissioner for reporting smokers and concurrently the narcotics suppression commissioner for Jiangsu Province and Shanghai City, Ma came to Shanghai at the end of last month to personally prepare for the establishment of the commissioner's office. The office address was selected at No. 18 Xing'an Lane, Jiangyin Street, Xiaoximen, Nanshi. Because the office is affiliated with the Military Affairs Commission, its nature is the same as a military agency. The internal organization is very simple. All arrangements have been completed, and the office was officially established and began operations yesterday. Under the commissioner, there are only a few staff members, all of whom have been appointed by Ma. As for Zhenjiang, only a liaison office has been set up within the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association.</p>
<p>Ma Departs Shanghai</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Commissioner's Office, seven members of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee, including Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Cai Jingjun, Wang Xiaolai, Yan Fqing, and Yu Zuoting, held a banquet in honor of Commissioner Ma at the East Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road at noon yesterday. During the banquet, Chairman Du delivered a welcome speech, followed by Ma reporting on his mission to Shanghai and conveying the instructions of the head office and Chief Supervisor Chiang. Subsequently, the members discussed the city's anti-smoking policy with Ma. After the banquet, Ma returned directly to his hotel for a short rest and then went out with Gui Yuhua, secretary of the City Anti-Smoking Association, for inspection. He returned late at night. Ma, having completed his affairs in Shanghai, took the 11:00 PM Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Zhenjiang to handle the affairs of the liaison office and to discuss the general anti-drug campaign and the reporting of drug use by public officials with the provincial authorities. He plans to go to Nanjing to report to the head office after completing his affairs in Zhenjiang and then return to Shanghai in a week to preside over the office's affairs and the citywide crackdown on drug use, which is scheduled to begin on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Strict Reporting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau was originally planning to start earlier on the citywide anti-drug campaign, which was ordered by the Military Affairs Commission. However, due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed. Now that Commissioner Ma has arrived in Shanghai, after discussion between Director Cai Jingjun and Ma, in order to quickly eliminate drugs and prevent local delays from affecting the entire anti-drug policy, it has been decided to start the citywide anti-drug campaign on the 10th of this month. It is reported that on the day the general campaign begins, the Commissioner's Office will jointly issue a public notice with the municipal government to inform all drug users in the city. At that time, all drug users, whether ordinary citizens or public officials, will be strictly reported. The reporting method will not temporarily use the Baojia system. Instead, based on the city's administrative organization system, the mayor, the director of the Public Security Bureau, the branch directors, and the precinct chiefs will jointly provide guarantees and commitments to be responsible for effectively reporting drug use.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association Approves Silk Merchants' Cocoon Collection Quotas</h3>
<p>Security Deposit of Over 290,000 Yuan Due Today</p>
<p>Loan Syndicate to Meet on the 10th to Discuss Lending</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the Zhejiang Provincial Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association has approved silk merchants to collect more than 300,000 dan of cocoons. Security deposits of over 290,000 yuan are due to be paid to the Bank of China today. The cocoon collection loan syndicate will hold a meeting on the 10th to approve the organizational charter and then establish an office to accept loan applications. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Collection of Over 300,000 Dan Approved</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Provincial Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association handled cocoon collection registration, silk merchants from various places have applied for registration. The deadline was the 25th of last month. According to the reporter's inquiry from the silk merchants, after the Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association's review, 38 Shanghai silk factories, 21 Zhejiang silk factories, and 18 Jiangsu silk factories, totaling 77 factories, were approved to set up factories and start collecting cocoons. In addition, 41 silk merchants were approved for individual registration. The total amount of cocoons to be collected is estimated to be 1,756 zao cheng for improved varieties and 1,872 zao cheng for local varieties, which amounts to 166,220 dan of fresh cocoons for improved varieties and 177,420 dan of fresh cocoons for local varieties, totaling 343,640 dan.</p>
<p>Security Deposit Due Today</p>
<p>All approved silk factories for cocoon collection are required to pay a security deposit of 299,220 yuan based on the amount of cocoons to be collected. The Zhejiang Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association has already notified each registered silk cocoon merchant and silk factory to pay the required security deposit in full to the Bank of China before 4:00 PM on the 4th (today) and obtain a payment receipt from the bank. Then, they must exchange the receipt for an official receipt from the Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association before they can collect cocoons within the territory of Zhejiang Province. Failure to pay the security deposit by the deadline will be considered as automatically forfeiting the right to collect cocoons. It is also learned that the Silk and Cocoon Unified Control Association intends to convene a regular meeting tomorrow to discuss whether to reopen registration, as there is still a surplus of fresh cocoons of improved varieties.</p>
<p>Loan Syndicate to Meet on the 10th</p>
<p>The spring cocoon loan syndicate, organized by 14 banks including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, decided to provide 30 million yuan in loans and welcomed the participation of various banks and businesses. In recent days, Xinhuada, Quanye, Zhizhong, Yongda, Fuyuan and other five banks and businesses have joined. Currently, seven representatives from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai-Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank are negotiating the organizational charter and lending methods. It is reported that in order to facilitate lending as soon as possible, as spring cocoons are about to be on the market and silk cocoon manufacturers need funds, the loan syndicate is scheduled to convene a general meeting on the 10th with representatives from all participating banks and businesses to approve the organizational charter and lending methods. Then, offices will be established in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Hangzhou to accept registration applications and begin lending.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Firms Hold Meeting Yesterday, Opinions Still Difficult to Unify</h3>
<p>Decision to be Made at Another Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yu Zuoting Visited the Minister to Appeal on Behalf of the Industry</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, after the foreign tea firms in this city suspended trading due to the unified control of Keemun tea in Anhui Province, it has been ten days. After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce advised them to resume trading first, they held a meeting yesterday and decided to hold another meeting to make a decision. Details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Another Meeting Required</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that since the tea industry has suspended trading for more than ten days, the livelihoods of tea farmers and tea workers in various places are in danger, and they have sent letters requesting to resume trading first. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter the day before yesterday advising the industry not to persist. The industry held a meeting the day before yesterday and accepted the Chamber of Commerce's advice in principle. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the association held another meeting. Representatives from various tea warehouses, including Chen Yizhou, Hong Mengpan, Zhuo Huapu, Deng Yongxiang, Fan Baosheng, Zheng Jianyuan, Peng Zhiping, Sun Zifu, Ye Yonghui, Zai Yintao, Deng Ruixiang, Ye Shichang, Tao Zhensheng, and Shan Jianming, totaling 14 people, attended. Chairman Chen Yizhou first reported on the progress of the situation, and then they discussed the matter of resuming trading. However, they were still unable to reach a consensus and will need to hold another meeting to make a decision. Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, visited Minister Wu the day before yesterday to discuss a solution.</p>
<p>Tea Industry Analogy</p>
<p>Yesterday, Secretary Dong of the Tea Industry Association told a reporter from Xin Sheng She that Deputy Manager Zeng said that tea warehouses are like rickshaws, and transportation and sales associations are like streetcars. Rickshaws cannot stop streetcars. After streetcars pass, rickshaws can still survive at the same time. Tea warehouses opposing the government is like rickshaws opposing streetcars. The analogy cannot be said to be inappropriate. Take Shanghai as an example, it is the place with the most streetcars and rickshaws, and they coexist without conflict. However, whether to take a streetcar or a rickshaw is up to the pedestrian. I have never seen someone who, after taking a rickshaw, the person in charge of the streetcar must pull them down and make them transfer to the streetcar. Now, the Anhui provincial government is forcing tea houses that have already received warehouse loans to receive official loans, which means they are under official management. How is this different from pulling someone sitting in a rickshaw to get on a streetcar? Pulling a rickshaw is done by someone who has no power, and operating a streetcar is done by someone who has power. Now the person in charge of the streetcar does not allow pedestrians to sit in rickshaws. How can rickshaws survive?</p>
<p>Telegram Request for Maintenance</p>
<p>The Foreign Tea Industry Association received a letter from the Jiujiang Tea House Transportation Tea Warehouse Industry Association and a copy of the telegram to the Executive Yuan, etc., which reads as follows: "To the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the former Anhui Construction Department proposed a method of transporting and selling Keemun tea at the National Economic Commission. The Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association believes that the proposal is similar to unified control and hinders the business of tea warehouses. It telegraphed the National Economic Commission to request its cancellation. Later, it received a reply from the National Economic Commission through the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that it was only approved in principle, but the unemployment and debts of tea merchants (i.e., tea warehouses) must be taken into account, and it was not unified control of Keemun tea. The Anhui Provincial Government's winter telegram only stated that it was studying transportation and sales, not unified control, and would not hinder tea warehouses from lending, so there was no need to worry. Therefore, the tea warehouses in Shanghai still proceeded to lend to tea houses in the three counties of Qihong. Our industry is still safely arranging transportation personnel to prepare for transporting on behalf of the tea houses. Unexpectedly, the Anhui Provincial Government suddenly established a Tea Transportation and Sales Committee and insisted on public transportation and public sales. This action by the Anhui Provincial Government is neither a central overall plan nor does it take into account the credibility of the National Economic Commission's telegram and the Provincial Government's winter telegram. It wants to use the capital that the tea warehouses have already lent out to implement a provincial state-owned profit-making policy, which is similar to speculation. Although the ignorant merchants cannot bear to do this, the Provincial Government is acting with dignity and doing it ignorantly, cutting off the life of the tea warehouse industry. The Shanghai tea warehouses' request to retain the right to sell is a request from the Shanghai tea warehouses and cannot represent our industry's abandonment of transportation. For the sake of the livelihood of all personnel in Xunfang, we should still request to maintain transportation. We are specially requesting the Executive Yuan to have mercy on the hardships of merchants and urgently order the Anhui Provincial Government to cancel the unified control and retain the tea warehouses' right to self-transport and self-sell in order to restore people's livelihood and stabilize business. We are fearful and earnestly imploring your mercy and awaiting orders. Sincerely, the Jiujiang Tea House Transportation Tea Warehouse Industry Association."</p>
<h3>National Products Manufacturers Association to Organize National Products Exhibition in Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>

<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association on Xizang Road in this city was previously instructed by the Guangxi Provincial Government to host the Guangxi Provincial National Products Exhibition. Preparations have been underway for three months, but due to the fact that the tax exemption and transportation reduction documents have not yet been received, it has been repeatedly postponed. Yesterday, the tax exemption certificate from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry was received, so the association is notifying all national product factories in the city to participate. The opening is scheduled for June 1, and the registration deadline is May 20.

<h3>China Construction Bank Corporation to Invest in Construction of Chengdu-Chongqing Railway</h3>
<p>Heads of Contract for 48 Million Agreed</p>
<p>Lu Zuofu to Come to Shanghai Soon to Continue Discussions and Sign Contract</p>
<p>Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department of Sichuan Province, flew from Chongqing to Beijing on the 1st to meet with Zhang Jiaao, Minister of Railways, for discussions. He is scheduled to come to Shanghai soon to continue negotiations with Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China Construction Bank Corporation, on a loan contract for 48 million yuan in investment. A reporter from Xin Xin She reports the details as follows:</p>
<p>Huge Investment by Construction Corporation</p>
<p>The construction cost of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was previously estimated by Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department of Sichuan Province, who submitted a budget and route map to the Minister of Railways for instructions. It was approved at 48 million yuan in national currency. Lu previously came to Shanghai to negotiate investment with Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China Construction Bank Corporation. Song expressed his acceptance in principle and sent personnel to Chongqing to continue discussing the detailed plan. It is learned that the Construction Bank Corporation has now decided to invest 48 million yuan to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The draft loan contract has been drawn up, and it will be secured by the post-disaster construction bonds issued by Sichuan Province on April 1, a portion of the third-phase bonds of the Ministry of Railways, and the income from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway after its completion. Director Lu is scheduled to come to Shanghai soon from Beijing to continue negotiations with Song, and then a formal decision can be made and a date set for signing the contract.</p>
<p>Railway Company Responsible for Construction</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the construction, the Sichuan Provincial Government, together with Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department, formulated a plan and negotiated with the Ministry of Railways to establish the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to be responsible for the construction. The organizational regulations have been approved by the Executive Yuan, stipulating a total share capital of 20 million yuan, divided into 200,000 shares. The Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government will each subscribe for 22,500 shares, and the rest will be raised independently. The company may issue bonds to supplement the shortage of construction funds. It has now been decided to first build the main line from Chengdu to Chongqing and the branch line from Neijiang to Zigong. After the above two lines are completed, other lines will be expanded. Director Lu's decision to come to Shanghai this time, in addition to making concrete decisions on the 48 million yuan loan, also intends to take the opportunity to contact the financial community for investment in the organization of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, so that it can be established as soon as possible. No. 27 to 2116, and 10 sheets of reduced shipping fee waybills, No. 75 to 84 of the round-trip waybills, are on file. In addition to notifying our member manufacturers to prepare and participate widely, we are sending a special letter to your government. Once our association has completed the collection of events, it will set a departure date to come to your province. We will then send a telegram. This is a special letter to inform you, I hope you will check it. Sincerely, to Huang, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Notice to All Factories</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association issued a notice to all national product factories in the city, which read as follows: "Regarding the matter of notification, our association previously received instructions from the Guangxi Provincial Government to host the Guangxi Provincial National Products Exhibition, which has already been announced. Now, the tax exemption and transportation reduction certificates have been issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry on May 1. Our association, in addition to sending a letter to the Provincial Government, has specially reproduced the tax exemption and transportation certificates by printing, in order to prove it. We have found that the construction industry in Guizhou Province has developed greatly in recent years and has long been known as a model. The public has a strong enthusiasm for using national products, and the slogan of saving the country with national products has become the only task in the province, and the prosperity of the southern industry can also be ranked first in the country. Therefore, exhibiting in this province will definitely have good results. The venue has been surveyed and determined to be inside the National Salvation Association, which is located in the bustling center of the province. The opening is scheduled for June 1, the registration deadline is May 20, and the departure is on the 25th. All national product factories that have not yet participated should come to the association to register as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity. All factories that have registered should come to the association immediately to report the amount of goods loaded to facilitate statistics. Please pay attention to this notice."</p>
<p>Letter from Guangdong Province</p>
<p>The association recently received a letter from the Secretariat of the Guangdong Provincial Government, which expressed strong support for the original purpose of the National Exhibition, so the association has decided to hold an exhibition in Guangdong after the National Exhibition in Guizhou is completed. The original letter from the Guangdong Provincial Government reads as follows: "Regarding the case of the China National Products Manufacturers Association requesting to hold a national product mobile exhibition, the Chairman of the State Council instructed to handle it according to the Construction Department's reply.

<h3>China-Philippines Trade Association Plans to Establish Soon</h3>
<p>Philippine Congressional Delegation Arrived in Shanghai on the 4th</p>
<p>According to Zhongyang She, in recent years, in order to develop international trade, trade associations such as the China-US, China-UK, and China-Japan Trade Associations have been established one after another. The Philippines is a new country. It has planned to establish a China-Philippines Trade Association with our country's business community. According to the reporter's inquiry, this decision was also mentioned to our country's business community and overseas Chinese affairs authorities by the Philippine Overseas Chinese Return to China Inspection Delegation when they returned to their country for inspection, and they all expressed strong support. It is reported that further discussions will be held in the near future in order to realize it as soon as possible. The trade relationship between the Philippines and our country occurred very early. In recent years, domestic products are making efforts to promote overseas, and various islands in Southeast Asia are hoping to establish trade relations with our country, fearing that other countries, in addition to promoting goods, also have political effects. In addition, a delegation of congressmen from the Philippine government visited Shanghai and Japan earlier this month. It is reported that the delegation arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru and transferred to various places for inspection. It arrived at 3:00 PM on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Telephone Dispute Incident</h3>
<p>Guangxing Customs Brokerage Reports Overcharging to Taxpayers Association</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Sends Letters to Various Organizations Suggesting Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association of this city received a letter from Guangxing Customs Brokerage, which read as follows: "Our firm, Guangxing Customs Brokerage, is located at No. 84486, Zilai Street, Weiwenfen. The reason is that this time the telephone company changed the way it charges for calls. Our firm received a bill on April 26 with 592 calls. Our eyes calculated only 244 calls. The discrepancy is as high as 348 calls, which at 3 cents each amounts to 10 yuan, 4 jiao, and 4 fen in foreign currency. Such overcharging, and the overcounting of calls to Nanshi, makes it difficult for us merchants to endure the monthly losses. Therefore, we are writing to your association, asking you to find a way to maintain justice. Otherwise, we will be endlessly harmed. If we can be united, we can solve the problem with one demolition. We also hope that the gentlemen of our association will use their great talents to rescue the merchants from their plight, etc." After receiving the letter, the association has made representations to the Shanghai Telephone Company and requested a prompt investigation and reply in order to inform the company.</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, Chen Daxun, from Tianjin, expressed his opinion from a legal standpoint on the issue of telephone price increases in the concession, and sent letters to various organizations such as the City South Association, the City Federation, and the Chinese Taxpayers Association, which read as follows: "Your association's leadership of the citizens in the matter of telephone price increases, with your enthusiasm and perseverance, is truly admirable. Recalling that the Shanghai Telephone Company has raised prices more than once, last year we opposed it even more strongly because it was very unreasonable. At that time, the Chinese Taxpayers Association advocated convening a special committee to investigate. After its establishment, there was a dispute over the scope of its duties. The Chinese Taxpayers Association advocated conducting a comprehensive study of the company, and experts reported that the telephone company had the right to raise prices, which is a legal interpretation and does not express any opinion. I believe that with the development of modern business, telephones have become an important means of communication. All countries in the world have made it a public utility, and it is state-owned, or if it is privately operated, there are special chapters to strictly supervise it, so as not to allow unscrupulous financiers to monopolize it for profit. Therefore, the legal issue is very worthy of study. Also, the basis for the telephone company's price increase is Article 13 of the contract signed between the company and the Shanghai Municipal Council on August 5, 1930. Paragraph 2 of that article states that 'after the automatic machine is completed, the Municipal Council and the company shall negotiate a schedule of charges that will allow the company's invested business capital to earn a net profit of 8 percent per year, plus a reserve of 2 percent.' The latter part of the article further explains what 'invested business capital' means, which includes four types: 1. The company's received shares and stocks, and the profits the company receives when the sale exceeds the face value; 2. The income from the company's issued bonds, etc.; 3. Loans borrowed by the company, such as mortgages, for a period of more than one year; 4. The ordinary public accumulation fund mentioned in Article 15 of this contract. After careful examination of the contract, it is not difficult for the Shanghai Telephone Company to increase prices at any time by certain methods. For example, if the company's current capital is 5 million yuan, according to the interest rate allowed by the Municipal Council, which is 10 percent, the annual income should be 500,000 yuan for interest. If there are 10,000 telephones in Shanghai, the interest burden per telephone per year is 50 yuan. If the company wants to increase the fee, it only needs to issue 5 million yuan in bonds. According to the provisions of the contract, it can increase the profit to 1 million yuan per year. By analogy, the burden on our citizens may increase at any time. Because the telephone is an indispensable tool in daily life, I believe that since it is difficult for us to dismantle the machines and resist, if we want to protect ourselves, we can only fundamentally overthrow the contract signed between the Municipal Council and the company. To be more specific, according to the Shanghai Telephone Company, which is a company organized in accordance with the laws of the United States, according to the precedents of various states in the United States, 'every kind of contract in which the selling price can be determined by the seller is difficult to execute and should be invalid.' The price charged by the Shanghai Telephone is similar to this, so we can gather all the users who do not approve of the price increase and legally deal with the company to cancel the 1930 contract, and then exercise the right of taxpayers to supervise the Municipal Council to establish a more reasonable condition. Only in this way can we [unclear], and there will be a day to lift the [unclear]. There are experts in [unclear] who have a plan in mind, I think that [unclear]. I sincerely offer my humble opinion and hope for your guidance. Thank you very much."</p>
<h3>Money Shop Exchange Fund Increases to 30,000 per Shop</h3>
<p>Managed by the United Money Shop Reserve</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Shop Association's Exchange Clearing House is the note clearing center for money shops. All payments between member shops exceeding 500 yuan require an official receipt. These are collected at the Association that evening and balanced against each other. For balances under 500 yuan, the handling procedure before the end of 1924 required immediate cash settlement. Since 1925, each member money shop has deposited 10,000 taels of silver with the Association as an exchange fund for security. Now, the exchange fund has been increased to 30,000 yuan in legal tender per shop, to be managed by the United Money Shop Reserve. With a total of 50 member money shops, the exchange fund amounts to 1.5 million yuan. The same procedures will be followed as before, with annual settlements at the end of each year.</p>
<h3>Miao Zhongxiu Discusses His Inspection of Raw Silk Inspection Administration in Japan</h3>
<p>China to Implement Inspections on July 1st</p>
<p>Miao Zhongxiu, a technician at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, was sent to Japan last month by order of the Ministry to inspect raw silk inspection practices as a reference for China's implementation of raw silk grading inspections. He has already returned to China. According to his discussion, the impressions gained from this inspection are as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspection Processes in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Raw silk inspection is divided into two categories: quantity and quality. For quantity, all countries have adopted the public weight system, so there are no issues. However, for quality, since its regulation and implementation by European raw silk producing and selling countries 40 years ago, both Japan and the United States have conducted detailed research, gradually improving inspection methods and machinery, and each has developed more advanced methods. However, they hold differing views, making it difficult to reconcile them. Therefore, in 1928, Japan and the United States held the first raw silk inspection conference in Yokohama, and in 1929, the second conference was held in New York. After two discussions, the opinions of both sides on inspection methods gradually converged. As for the issue of raw silk grading, each held its own theory. The United States advocated that each grade's quality should be based on the minimum standard, while Japan used the average number as the standard. Each then formulated grades and specified the quality of each grade. Japan then forcibly implemented grading inspections in January 1932. All exported raw silk must be inspected for quality by the government inspection office, and the grade must be specified. Raw silk trade is based on the grade assessed by the inspection office, and silk mills and exporters are not allowed to interfere. This is the process of discussing raw silk grading inspections in various countries and the situation of Japan's implementation of grading inspections. China's raw silk trade has many longstanding problems. The most important is that exporters' inspection standards for raw silk often shift with silk prices. If the silk price at the time of delivery is higher than at the time of the contract, the inspection will be lenient; conversely, it will be strict. Quality is uncertain, and disputes frequently arise. Of these two problems, the former harms manufacturers, while the latter results in inferior goods flooding foreign markets, damaging the reputation of Chinese silk. Japan was in a similar situation before it forcibly implemented grading inspections. Since grading inspections have been carried out by government agencies, the aforementioned longstanding problems have been immediately eliminated. After raw silk is graded and quality standards are specified, those who sell raw silk in various countries can specify the grade they need to order without having to inspect it themselves to know the quality of the goods they are purchasing. China's implementation of raw silk grading inspections will greatly benefit the export of Chinese silk. In the future, foreign buyers of Chinese silk will only accept goods after obtaining China's grade certificate. Then, when Chinese silk is exported to foreign markets, quality will be clearly distinguished, and exporters will not be able to manipulate it. The reputation of Chinese silk can then be maintained and not decline. Foreign buyers of Chinese silk will find it more convenient and secure, and will naturally be happy to purchase it. The export of Chinese silk is therefore bound to be smooth. Furthermore, China's direct competitor in raw silk exports is Japanese silk. The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of grading inspections, has long issued orders for mandatory implementation. This reporter, when meeting with exporters in Yokohama, all said that although the Japanese government faced difficulties at first in implementing this policy, since last July, domestic and foreign trade have both felt more convenient, and the Japanese government has achieved good results. China should quickly catch up and adopt the same policy.</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy Proves Effective</h3>
<p>When Japan began grading inspections in 1932, the standards for raw silk grading and the quality of each grade were broader than the regulations for raw silk grading in the United States. In addition, the inspection personnel lacked technical proficiency. As a result, the grades determined by Japan were not very consistent with the results of inspections in the United States in 70 percent of cases. The Japanese silk market was therefore extremely chaotic. Businesses engaged in raw silk exports felt difficulty because the right to determine the grade lay with the government, while the responsibility for passing or failing rested with the merchants. It was not until June of last year that the quality standards were revised. Previously, only the overall average number was emphasized, but now the overall average number has been raised across the board, and at the same time, the minimum score is also emphasized. In addition, several quality inspection items have been added. All measures are stricter than the US regulations, which focus solely on the minimum score. The inspection procedures are also more complete than before. After strict reorganization, 80 to 90 percent of Japanese silk exported to the United States is accepted according to the grade assessed by the Japanese inspection office. Japanese-American raw silk trade is extremely convenient both domestically and internationally. Japan has indeed reaped the benefits of implementing grading inspections. The reason for its effectiveness lies in the strictness of the grading regulations and the novelty of the inspection methods, aimed at promoting domestic producers' efforts to improve through meticulous grading inspections. China has decided to implement raw silk grading inspections on July 1st. If it can be strict at the start and suit the needs of foreign markets, then its credibility will be established, and its effects will be significant. Japan's past experience can serve as clear evidence. It rests on the government and silk merchants holding the same determination.</p>

<h3>Tung Oil Expert Discusses Plans to Increase Tung Oil Exports</h3>
<p>Improve Production, Manufacturing, and Sales to Enhance International Credibility</p>
<p>Engage in Direct Trade to Consolidate Foreign Markets</p>
<p>According to the *Shenshi News*, tung oil is a special product of China, and exports have been extremely strong in recent years. Since last year, it has consistently ranked first among China's export commodities, and it has become even more active this year. This is indeed an encouraging phenomenon in our foreign trade. However, upon examining the reasons for the sudden surge in exports, it is purely due to a surge in temporary foreign demand, rather than China's tung oil having the ability to expand sales channels. Furthermore, foreign countries are vigorously promoting tung tree planting, so the future of China's tung oil is difficult to be optimistic about. The reporter from the *Shenshi News* made a special visit to an expert yesterday to inquire about plans to maintain the permanent prosperity of tung oil exports. The expert explained the situation as follows:</p>
<p>There are Three Reasons for Strong Sales Abroad</p>
<p>The reporter first inquired about the reasons for the strong tung oil exports. The expert replied that the export of tung oil this year is more active than last year. The total exports for January and February reached more than 14 million yuan. The prosperity of exports is rare in recent years. The increase in China's tung oil exports can be attributed to the following points: The United States is the largest sales market for China's tung oil, with an average annual import of 120 million pounds. After the economic panic occurred, it decreased to 70-80 million pounds. In recent years, due to the implementation of recovery and economic plans, which have been quite effective, various industries have gradually recovered, and the demand for tung oil has gradually returned to normal. Therefore, China's tung oil sales have suddenly increased, accounting for 80% of total exports. Since last year, the slogan of the Second World War has deeply penetrated people's hearts, and the frenzy of preparedness for war in various countries is like the eve of the war. The outbreak of war has indeed become increasingly acute. The occurrence of the Italian-Ethiopian War in October last year and the German troops' entry into the Rhineland on March 7 this year are both triggering events. War clouds are densely packed around the world. In the future, the Mediterranean Sea will inevitably be closed, and the import of war necessities will inevitably be hindered. European countries, in order to prepare for a rainy day, are all stockpiling raw materials, and tung oil is one of the important raw materials. Therefore, China's foreign trade in tung oil is very popular with various countries. As for the reason for the soaring price of tung oil, tung oil is produced in the interior, and transportation and sales are quite tortuous. Once demand surges, the market inventory is exhausted, and it cannot be supplied continuously, so the price increase is inevitable.</p>
<p>Production and Sales Methods Urgently Need Improvement</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the reason for the strong tung oil exports from China is actually the surge in overseas demand, and the reason for the price increase is that China's tung oil supply is less than demand. However, this phenomenon is only the result of a temporary shortage of demand, rather than the ability of China's tung oil to expand sales in overseas markets. It is difficult to regard it as a normal development. Therefore, if we want to maintain the permanent prosperity of tung oil exports, we must fundamentally improve the production and sales of tung oil. The cultivation methods of tung oil in China are extremely unrefined. After the oil presses purchase the tung oil, they store it arbitrarily, which inevitably leads to spoilage. The oil extraction methods also stick to the old methods, and do not know how to improve them. Therefore, the quality is poor, the colors are uneven, the impurities are not completely removed, the oil residue is too heavy, and the acidity is too high. Therefore, the oil extraction rate is extremely low. The annual loss of oil production nationwide is alarming. The sales procedures are extremely cumbersome, and some merchants mix in adulterated oil to make a large profit, which deteriorates the quality and affects foreign credibility. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry stipulates that all tung oil exports must be inspected for quality by the Commodity Inspection Bureau. Only after passing the inspection can it be exported, so as to increase the credibility of foreign trade. Compulsory inspections are scheduled to begin on July 1. The loading and transportation methods are not good, the transportation costs are high, and there are often obstructions, which often prevent on-time delivery, so the market is at risk of supply falling short of demand. Tung oil exports are entirely controlled by foreign firms. There is no domestic organization that directly engages in tung oil exports, and oil merchants cannot connect, so the market and market prices are entirely manipulated by foreigners. In order to consolidate foreign markets, the above four points must be improved.</p>
<p>The World Market is Not Difficult to Dominate</p>
<p>The expert also said that tung oil is one of China's special products, which has a monopoly nature in the international market. If we can seize the opportunity, start improving rapidly, and establish international credibility, then the future will be very bright. The most important way to improve is in production, manufacturing, and sales. In terms of production, the first thing to do is to concentrate China's tung oil, with government assistance, to engage in large-scale planting. In this way, scientific methods can be cited, varieties can be uniform, the production volume can be calculated, and the output can be increased naturally. In terms of manufacturing, new methods should be used for oil extraction to increase efficiency. At the same time, attention must also be paid to refining and separating the grades of oil to determine the standards for each grade. In terms of transportation, economic loading and transportation methods should be studied, and transportation agencies should also find ways to reduce freight and implement responsible transportation in order to achieve the goal of economy and convenience. As for trade, the fundamental way is to concentrate exports. If domestic tung oil merchants can unite and organize a large-scale export organization with common strength, then China's foreign tung oil market will be consolidated day by day.</p>
<p>The United States is Vigorously Promoting Tung Tree Planting</p>
<p>The expert also said that the United States is the largest market for tung oil exports, and the United States is now vigorously promoting tung tree planting. Recent achievements are quite remarkable. There are 60,000 acres scattered in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. There are many tung trees, the development is good, and there are two major tung oil factories. The future development will be very rapid. Since the United States is the only target of China's tung oil exports, it is advisable to find ways to improve, otherwise, the sales in the United States will inevitably decline, and the future will be greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, Oikawa, Returns to Shanghai by Ship Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart for the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River on the 10th</p>
<p>Koshirō Oikawa, Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, previously took the flagship "Izumo" north for inspection. It is now known that Oikawa has completed his tasks, and the flagship returned to Shanghai around 1:00 PM yesterday, anchoring on the river surface at the Dalian Wharf in Yangshupu. It is scheduled to depart again for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Female Students in Shanghai Continue to Enthusiastically Donate to Spring Relief</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at No. 505 Henan Road, has always focused on construction and disaster relief. Because many school youth are enthusiastic about public welfare, it sends personnel to various schools to give lectures, hoping to gain sympathy. They have responded with donations, and therefore launched a construction and disaster relief fundraising campaign two years ago, which is held once a year, allowing students to donate according to their abilities. Since the opening of the fundraising, many people have participated, including more than 100 male and female schools. In half a year, they raised more than 30,000 yuan in national currency. The Commission used these donations to fund the Jiangning Chunhua Town water conservancy project and the Hefei road construction labor relief project. Last summer, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flooded one after another. The Commission submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior to organize Jianghe flood disaster relief and engage in relief efforts, calling for donations from home and abroad. The schools, because the disaster was severe and the disaster area was vast, and urgent relief could not be delayed, used the construction donations from peacetime as flood relief funds, contributing generously. This year, the spring famine is still serious in various disaster areas, and the victims have no food or clothing, and are in urgent need of assistance. The Commission continued to organize spring relief and gave lectures to solicit donations from various schools. Touched by the disaster, many people continued to donate to relief funds. It is agreed that female students are kind-hearted, support good deeds, and do not want to lag behind others. The Qixiu, Yunzhong, Xiaoming, Huizhong, Huiqun, Jinde, Zhongxi, Biwen, Huadong, Qiande, and Yan family and other female schools have all raised large sums of money to be sent to the Commission for the benefit of female youth who are happy to do good deeds, which is enough to be a model for society.</p>
<h3>Disaster Report from Xinye County, Henan</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society in Shanghai, according to a telegram from Yangri of the Xinye County Zhenwu Branch, reported that Xinye suffered unprecedented flooding last year. Not only were houses destroyed, but also nearly a century of accumulated seeds were swept away, and both machines and drowning occurred at the same time, which was urgent. Fortunately, thanks to the national rescue efforts, as well as chaff, wild grass, autumn and winter, we were able to survive. Since then, aid has been cut off and the grass has been exhausted, and cooking smoke has been cut off. Throughout the disaster area, there are no dogs, the trees have been exhausted, and the four walls are empty. Bone-thin children are weeping, leaning on their thin mothers, and the hungry men who have not escaped are lying beside the village waiting for their lives to end. And as the new crops are not yet ready, the price of rice is soaring, which is a life-threatening talisman for the dying poor. Knowing that Jun will have compassion for his compatriots and will treat all things with generosity, and will be devoted to rescuing disasters. The sea will be a model. It has been rescued from the deep water and severe cold, and the whole life should be taken when the beans and wheat are ripe. There are not many days left, and we cannot wait to die. Regardless of food, we await your voice and send out an emergency rescue.</p>
<h3>Summary of Anhui Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society in Shanghai received a letter from the Anhui Red Swastika Society in northern Anhui, which stated that natural disasters in Anhui were frequent. The drought in the autumn was most severe in Huoshou and Yingfu counties in northern Anhui. Now is the time when the new crops are not yet ready, and it is the time when the survival of one million disaster victims hangs in the balance. Locust fruits, cottonseed, grass roots, and tree bark have long been eaten. The strong have scattered in all directions, and the weak have committed suicide by drinking poison. As for selling wives and children, the daily news is filling the pit. The dead are gone, turned into ants in the underworld, and what is the life of the living, surviving only on one breath. Moreover, there have been years of banditry in each county, and the people are floating. If there are traitors, they will be born from it, and the future dangers will be unimaginable. Representatives have witnessed the tragic situation in the disaster area, and they dare to call for help by telegram, begging for mercy. Last year, the Society organized relief efforts in Huoyingfu and other counties, as well as shelters, and saved countless lives with medicine. This year, due to the lack of relief funds, relief and medicine delivery are still difficult to carry out. Now is the time when the new crops are not yet ready, and the disaster areas are in urgent need of rescue. It is hoped that all good people at home and abroad will make good connections, so as to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Measures for Registering Ownerless Barren Tombs and Public Burial Grounds in County Territory</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Land Administration Bureau (ordered to change the Land Bureau to the Land Administration Bureau) has not yet established regulations for the registration of ownerless barren tombs and public burial ground land, resulting in frequent difficulties. The following provincial order is now issued: If the ownership of ownerless barren tombs and public burial grounds belongs to township and town offices, the township and town chiefs should apply for registration on behalf of the office, and the procedures should be carried out in accordance with the regulations. If the ownership does not belong to township and town offices, the county Land Administration Bureau should register on behalf of the public land. In addition to complying with the order, the Bureau has issued letters to all district offices for reference.</p>
<h3>Smuggling of Tax-Evasive Artificial Silk Uncovered</h3>
<p>Li Xiaorong, a 34-year-old man from Ningbo, who used to be a broker, yesterday declared 13 packages of artificial silk at the baggage room of the Nanxingqiao Station in Hangzhou, packed in two boxes, and transported them as packages. In order to evade taxes and profit from smuggling, he delivered them to the Shanghai West Station via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Hangzhou-Lai express train, where they were inspected by the railway police. The person and goods were detained together, taken to the Railway Police Section, and sent to the Customs for processing.</p>
<h3>Rural Man Killed by Train on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line</h3>
<p>At 8:30 AM this morning, a Beijing-bound express train passed through Bridge No. 29 in Songjiang. A rural man, aged about 30, was walking on the track of the bridge. He failed to avoid the train and was struck in the head and killed by the locomotive. The station sent police to inform the local bailiff and report to the Songjiang Court for an autopsy. A search was launched for relatives of the deceased to go to the station to claim the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department to Suppress Dance Schools</h3>
<p>Content No Different from Dance Halls</p>
<p>Practice Tickets Are Dance Tickets</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council Police Department believes that dance schools have sprung up like mushrooms after rain recently. Statistics show that there are no fewer than dozens of them in the concession alone. Although they appear to be schools for practicing dancing on the surface, their content is actually no different from dance halls. Every night, they openly sell tickets, but they call them practice tickets. These dance schools have not obtained formal licenses from the Municipal Council, so if they are not strictly suppressed, it will not only affect the business of dance halls, but also violate police regulations. Therefore, the department issued a notice to all subordinate police stations to suppress them uniformly. The areas under the jurisdiction of the Laozha Police Station and the General Police Station are the areas where these dance schools are concentrated. Recently, Deputy Chinese Police Chief Lu Dagong and Xu Chengceng went to the New World Dance Art Club established by Wu Ziliang at No. 518, upstairs of the Fenghua Clothing Store at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road, and the Far East Women's Travel Agency established by Xu Zhiyin at No. 518, 5th floor of the Continental Shopping Mall on Nanjing Road, and the Xiangsheng Dance Academy established by Liu Genshen at No. 588 Sichuan Road, to investigate and purchase so-called practice tickets, bringing them back to the police station. Immediately, in accordance with Article 34 of the Prohibited Penalties Law, the above three companies were sued to the First Special Court. The court summoned Wu Ziliang, Liu Genshen, and Xu Zhiyin to court the day before yesterday. After the judge questioned them, Wu Ziliang and Xu Zhiyin were each fined eight yuan. However, the part of Liu Genshen was ordered to withdraw and wait for the police station to investigate and change the date to Monday for another interrogation because Liu Ming said that the Xiangsheng Dance Academy was opened by Portuguese man Santos.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Machine-Made Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs issued a public notice on the exhibition of machine-made goods, saying: "The machine-made goods exhibition hall is located on the third floor of this customs. It collects and displays the products of various factories in this port that enjoy the treatment of machine-made foreign-style goods, classifies them, and publicly exhibits them. Except for Sundays and holidays, it is open to the public for free viewing from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM. If the aforementioned factories need to send samples to the hall for display or change the already displayed samples, they can contact the factory survey office on the first floor of this customs."</p>
<h3>Young Woman Attending Wedding Banquet Robbed and Wounded En Route</h3>
<p>A Bullet Pierces Her Lung</p>
<p>A Peddler Also Hit by a Stray Bullet</p>
<p>A young woman from Ningbo named Ji Zhaodi, 33 years old, residing on Longjiang Road in Yangshupu, eastern Shanghai, was attending the wedding of her friend surnamed Fang yesterday. The wedding banquet was held in the inner hall of the Dafu Wine and Food Restaurant inside the Dashu Gate in the southern city, inviting relatives and friends. Yesterday, Zhaodi, along with her friend Fan Shenshi and Tao Yunwu, took a tram at 11:20 AM to the 16th Pier. The three then walked south along Zhonghua Road, passing near the Sun Family Alley entrance in the Dong Street area, when suddenly two robbers dressed in black short shirts and pants jumped out from the roadside, blocking their path. They brandished handguns, ordering them to remain silent. They forcibly robbed Zhaodi of a gold bracelet on her arm (worth 80 yuan). As they were about to flee with the loot, Zhaodi, in desperation, immediately chased after them and grabbed one of the robbers, shouting "Catch the thief!" This angered one of the robbers, who fired a shot. With a "bang," the bullet hit Zhaodi's chest, piercing her lung. Instantly, blood gushed out like a spring, and she collapsed to the ground in extreme pain. The robbers seized the opportunity to escape. While fleeing, they fired several more shots along the way. Amidst the stray bullets, a shoe peddler named Shao Liqing (a 54-year-old from Ningbo) was hit in the right ankle. When the police station of the nearby Yimiao Temple heard the alarm, they immediately dispatched a large number of officers to rush to the scene of the incident, but the robbers were nowhere to be found. The injured Ji Zhaodi and Shao Liqing, both male and female, were sent to the hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, because Zhaodi was hit in a vital area and lost too much blood, she died shortly after despite attempts to save her. Shao Liqing's injury was relatively minor, and his life was not in danger.</p>
<h3>Fire at Pig Bristle Store Kills Child Bride</h3>
<p>Dismembered Body is a Gruesome Sight</p>
<p>The Xu Yongji pig bristle store at No. 176-177 North Caojiazhai on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai was opened by Xu Yongchang from Changzhou. His family resided within the store. The outside was surrounded by bamboo fences covered with reed mats, with piles of pig bristles stacked everywhere. Yesterday at 4:30 AM, a fire suddenly broke out within the pile of pig bristles. Fanned by the south wind, the fire spread to the entire house. Xu's wife, Xiudi, his son Jinqing, 14 years old, and a child bride, Xindi, 13 years old, lived on the upper floor. Three apprentices lived on the ground floor. At the time, the apprentices discovered the fire and shouted frantically. Xu's wife heard the alarm, but the house was already engulfed in flames. His son, Jinqing, escaped in his sleep. The child bride, Xindi, woke up and tried to flee, but a burning roof beam broke and fell directly on the back of her head, instantly killing her with a cracked skull and bleeding. By the time the Caojiadu fire brigade arrived to extinguish the fire, the house had already been completely destroyed. Xindi's corpse was burned, and her dismembered body was a gruesome sight to behold. The store owner, Xu Yongchang, had returned to his hometown the day before due to some business, so he was not at home. The other five people were fortunate not to be injured. The Caojiadu Public Security Bureau is investigating the cause of the fire and has instructed the local bailiff to report to the court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain in the City</h3>
<p>Gloomy and Damp Weather Unpleasant</p>
<p>Excessive Moisture in Mulberry Leaves Could Harm Silkworms</p>
<p>Since the weather in the city turned from rain to clear on the 30th of last month, until the day before yesterday, it was again windy and rainy. The fog was also heavy during the day, and the rain dripped intermittently into the evening, dripping from the eaves all night. Yesterday, the rain stopped in the countryside, but the sky was still very gloomy. The indoors were extremely damp, making people uncomfortable. According to those concerned about sericulture, the continuous spring rain has made the mulberry leaves too moist. Young silkworms eat too much moisture, making their bodies weak and hindering the harvest. Silkworm farmers should dry the mulberry leaves in the shade for several hours before feeding them to the silkworms to reduce moisture and avoid harming the silkworms.</p>
<h3>Xiang Woman Liu Suying Accuses of Offenses Against Morality</h3>
<p>Xie Fuchun Already Has a Wife</p>
<p>Yet Deceives and Engages, then Seduces</p>
<p>Liu Suying, a 21-year-old woman from Changsha, Hunan, residing at No. 39 Gaochang Temple, recently hired lawyer Xu Lin to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing her fellow townsmen Xie Fuchun (residing at No. 82 Ladu Road, Remi Road, Xieyuancheng Shenji Wine Shop) and Li Tiqin (residing at No. 52 Lujiawan, Longhua, in the Chinese area) of offenses against morality. The gist of her accusation is as follows: The plaintiff, on November 29th of last year, followed her mother's instructions and became engaged to the first defendant, with the second defendant acting as the matchmaker. After exchanging engagement letters, the first defendant, taking advantage of the established engagement, frequently visited the plaintiff's home, attempting to seduce and defile her. The plaintiff, due to the engagement, did not firmly refuse. However, on the afternoon of February 5th of this year, at around 3 PM, the first defendant's mother and sister-in-law suddenly came to the plaintiff's house, telling the plaintiff's mother not to let her daughter be harmed, as Xie Fuchun had already married and had two sons, and it was best to break off the engagement. The plaintiff returned home from school at around 6 PM that same day and discovered this matter, feeling as if struck by lightning. Considering the defendant's actions, he had committed the crimes of fraud and seduction under Article 298 of the Criminal Law. The second defendant, knowing that the first defendant had a wife, colluded in the fraud, also committing the same crime. The plaintiff requested that they be arrested and investigated according to the law, and also requested additional civil compensation, ruling that the defendants should compensate for the loss of 3,000 yuan. The court, based on the indictment, recently had Judge Zhang Chaozu preside over the trial in the Fourth Court. The defendants did not appear. The plaintiff and her attorney were present. Arguing that it concerned morality, the court prohibited spectators. As a result, the court ordered the arrest of the two defendants for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Property After Cai Fulin's Death</h3>
<p>Attempted Reconciliation Failed</p>
<p>Second Hearing Summoned the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Cai Fulin, a former comprador of the British American Tobacco Company, passed away last year, leaving behind considerable property, which was inherited by his sons Zhenhuan, Zhentong, Zhenkang, Zhenwu, and Zhenlu. Now, Cai Fulin's nieces, Cai Baoying and Baojie, have come forward to assert their rights, demanding that Zhenhuan and others distribute a portion of the inheritance to them, but their demands have not been met. They have hired lawyer Huang Yiyan to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division, seeking the return of the inheritance. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Mo Runhua presided over a hearing in the Sixth Civil Court. The defendants also hired lawyer Le Junwei to represent them. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Huang, who rose to state the case, said that during the adjournment, the defendant's side showed no sincerity, so the reconciliation failed. Cai's family consists of three branches: Chang Fulin, Jue Meilin, and You Yunlin. The defendants are descendants of Fulin. Fulin passed away last year. The plaintiffs are descendants of Meilin. Meilin passed away as early as 1919. The plaintiffs had an elder brother named Zhenyang, who died of illness in 1929. In 1928, Zhenyang, along with his uncle Fulin and uncle Yunlin, signed an analysis document, besides the cash that was divided at the time, there were four pieces of real estate, which were kept by the uncle Fulin, and in 1930, a certificate of safekeeping was issued, and all rent collection matters were managed by Fulin, and 200 yuan was paid to the plaintiff monthly, but all income and expenditure were never reported, and the plaintiffs were completely unaware of it. After the uncle passed away last year, all unfinished affairs should be inherited and handled by the defendant, but unexpectedly, since October of last year, the defendants stopped paying the 200 yuan. When asked about it and requested an accounting, they kept delaying. Obviously, there was an intention to swallow it, so please order the defendant to hand over the detailed accounts from 1928 to the end of the execution, and then return the four pieces of real estate to the plaintiff, and request permission for provisional execution. Then the defendant's lawyer Le Junwei defended that the plaintiff's father Meilin Gong had one son and three daughters, the son was Zhenyang, the three daughters were eldest Baoying, Jue Ayu, and deceased Sanbao. Zhenyang died in 1929, at that time Zhenyang's wife Tao and aunt Li (that is, Zhenyang's mother) died in 1934, and the great-aunt Zhu and relatives were present, and it was agreed to establish Yuxiang as a successor, although the plaintiff was born to Meilin, his estate was already divided and inherited by Meilin's son Zhenyang in 1928, and Meilin died in 1919, although the analysis document was established in 1928, its inheritance began in 1919, so the plaintiff has no right to inherit Meilin's estate, and the plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected. Judge Mo ordered the case to be adjourned to the afternoon of the 12th of this month, and ordered the two parties to appear in court for another trial in person. During the adjournment, the two parties should still try to reconcile.</p>

It has also submitted one copy each of the Chinese and English versions of China's detailed rules for intestine inspection to the Ministry of Industry, requesting it to instruct the Consul General in Sydney to negotiate with the Australian government to cancel the import ban on China's intestines to benefit commerce.</p>

<h3>Xie Lin Hosted a Reception for Accounting Students from Three Colleges Yesterday</h3>
<p>Total Attendees Exceeded 120, Including Cheng Shaode</p>
<p>Xie Expressed Hope for an Increase in Accounting Talent</p>
<p>Mr. Xie Lin, Head of the Accounting Department of the School of Business at Fudan University, and Professor at the National Shanghai College of Commerce and Guanghua University School of Business, hosted a reception at noon yesterday at the New Asia Hotel for graduates of the accounting departments of the aforementioned three colleges. Over 120 guests attended, including Cheng Shaode, An Shaoyun, Yang Yinpu, Yang Rumei, Jin Guoshi, Sun Luohua, accountants Qin Kai, Cheng Xianzhi, and graduates from the accounting departments of the three colleges. Mr. Xie delivered a welcome speech, stating that the purpose of the gathering was specifically to honor the accounting graduates of the National Shanghai College of Commerce, Fudan University School of Business, and Guanghua University. He thanked Mr. Cheng Shaode and others for attending to deliver speeches, and also welcomed all colleagues from the Zhengze Accounting Firm, which he had co-founded. He expressed his honor at their presence and stated that the event should not be viewed as a mere ordinary banquet, but rather held four kinds of significance: He is currently dedicated to accounting and deals with matters closely related to accounting every day. However, due to the imperfect accounting system in China, he often encounters difficulties. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that more accounting professionals will emerge, so that the government and society's accounting systems can be gradually improved. Graduates from the three colleges will soon serve the community, and whether as officials or businessmen, they can cooperate at any time and in any place. He is willing to facilitate introductions among them. Accounting practice is essential for graduates of the three colleges. His colleagues are more knowledgeable and can exchange academic insights. In the future, there will be many opportunities to assist each other in serving society, so he hopes to introduce them to each other. He is willing to offer his advice regarding the future career paths of graduates from the three colleges. As accounting majors, they will have three main responsibilities: (A) creating accounting systems, (B) improving existing accounting methods, and (C) managing accounting. Furthermore, he would like to offer suggestions regarding the relationship between "law" and "Chinese language" and accounting. Since the establishment of the National Government, many laws have been promulgated, and accountants have deep connections with laws in everything they do. Even slight negligence can lead to failure. For example, the General Principles of the Civil Code, the Book of Obligations, the Book of Property Rights, the Company Law, the Negotiable Instruments Law, the General Rules for Merchants, the Banking Law, the Stamp Tax Law, and other specialized commercial and civil regulations are all necessary for accountants in their daily work. New graduates tend to overlook this. The Chinese language is a tool for conveying meaning and is closely related to success or failure. Calligraphy should be neat, not only for appearance but also to demonstrate personal academic qualifications. Mr. Cheng Shaode and others are in charge of education at the three colleges and are recognized accounting experts. He believes that their presence to deliver speeches is welcomed and appreciated by the students. He also invited the CPAs from his firm currently in Shanghai, Qin Kai, Zhang YiYan, Sheng Zhihua, Li Dawei, Cheng Xianzhi, and Xue Difu, who are experienced in accounting, to provide guidance so that the students can follow their example. He then offered a toast, wishing everyone a bright future. After Mr. Xie's speech, Jin Guobao, Qin Kai, Cheng Xianzhi, and others delivered speeches in succession. Toasts were exchanged, and the reception concluded around 1:30 PM.</p>

<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>Shanghai Secondhand Store Sells Cheaply Pledged Clothes: At the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, the Shanghai Secondhand Store purchased a large batch of confiscated goods pledged by the bank with a huge amount of cash, including American flower flag chicken skin coats, tracksuits, and many British silk-faced modern women's raincoats, which are sold cheaply at the auctioned price. Calculated and compared with the market, it is more than one profit cheaper. During this period of uncertain sunny and rainy weather, and unpredictable cold and warm weather, it is appropriate to go shopping.</p>
<p>There is only one Tonghan Chun Pharmacy: Tonghanchuntang Pharmacy at the Xiaodongmen Nei Main Street (i.e. Fanghong Road) was first established during the Qianlong reign of the Qian dynasty. Up to now, it has been more than 140 years since the first old store. There is only this one, and there are no branches. The pills, powders, plasters, decoctions, ginseng, and other items are all carefully selected for their excellence and authenticity, and have long been famous. If you want to distinguish between authenticity and falsehood, you only need to pay attention to the word "Han".</p>
<p>Three-Purpose Safety Mirror is Born: The Sino-American Invention Society at No. 4 Tongfu Village, Tongfu Road in this city has invented a new three-purpose safety mirror, which is used to distinguish banknotes, nickel coins. The four sides are made of silver-colored steel, and there is a microscope in the middle. Counterfeit banknotes and counterfeit coins can be identified immediately, and the form is beautiful and can be used as a toy. The original price is 5 cents, and now that it is just beginning to seek popularity, the special price is 30% off. Various five-plus shops are selling it on consignment.</p>
<p>Bathing Soap "Bathing should often be taken." This is an important maxim for hygiene. It is advisable to take a bath in summer. However, sweat and dirt in summer cannot be cleaned without the use of soap. The various fragrant soaps on the market are of poor quality. It is not only harmful to the skin, but also has a great impact on health. The various fragrant soaps and medicinal soaps produced by the Shanghai Central Soap Factory all use high-quality raw materials and are refined by chemical science. The quality far exceeds various imported products. At this time when summer bathing is tense, it is suitable for those who use fragrant soap.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Insurance Industry (Performance)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(Twenty-three of Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Overview)</p>
<p>3. The Characteristics of the Chinese Insurance Industry</p>
<p>Although the strength of the Chinese insurance industry cannot compete with foreign merchants, it has established a considerable foundation. It has considerable functions in recovering rights and interests and maintaining national strength. The regrettable thing is that the capital of each company is still relatively short. In order to reduce responsibility and balance insurance, it often has reinsurance contracts with foreign merchants companies. In fact, it still has a close relationship with foreign insurance companies. Huge annual business is still indirectly shared with foreigners. This is the first characteristic of today's Chinese insurance industry.</p>
<p>Today's Chinese insurance industry still has a close relationship with foreign merchants on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is a sideline of the capital of the financial industry. Most Chinese insurance companies are invested by the financial industry, and most of their main personnel are also concurrently held by related financial industry personnel. This is the second characteristic of today's Chinese insurance industry.</p>
<p>4. The Authority of Shanghai's Insurance Industry — Stanley —</p>
<p>If we want to understand the current situation of Shanghai's insurance industry today, we must know something about the resume of Stanley S arr C.Y., the authority of Shanghai's insurance industry. Mr. Stanley is an American. After practicing law in California, USA, he stopped his business due to the downturn in the law business. In 1917, the European War broke out and he joined the army. After the war, he came to Shanghai and founded the American Asia Insurance Agency to manage the affairs of insurance companies such as Greater America and New World under the management of the American Insurance Association. Although the business was quite developed, it was separated from the American Insurance Association due to excessive compensation. Later, he was commissioned as an agent in China by companies such as the American Global Federal, so that Mr. Shi could show his skills, win over powerful compradors, and jointly found Meiya with local Chinese and foreign financiers. After hard work and no effort, he made huge profits in a few years, and then organized the AIG Bank and AIG Life Insurance Company, and changed Meiya Insurance Agency into a company, and issued shares in the market. According to insurance industry common sense, the nature of insurance agents cannot be compared with insurance companies. Mr. Shi is a insurance agent and issued a large number of shares. His courage and skills are commendable. Later, in order to develop business, he also formed a French-American Insurance Company with the legal person SigantE to seek a place in Annam, and cooperated with the British Schmits to register in Hong Kong to organize the British Sihai Insurance Company to obtain business in Hong Kong. In addition, he also invested in Taishan Insurance Company, which is operated by Chinese businessmen. Mr. Shi takes Meiya as the center and holds the hub of the insurance industry in Shanghai. Its strong influence is second to none in the industry.</p>
<p>5. The Future of Shanghai's Insurance Industry</p>
<p>Since its inception, Shanghai's insurance industry has been booming and is now at its peak. Although it has been slightly affected by the recent decline in the market and the decline in industry and commerce, the concentration of funds in the city has failed to flow internally for a while. The real estate business has become a thing of the past. The public price and bid markets have recently become increasingly deserted. It is inevitable that the excess funds will be invested in the insurance industry in the future. However, today's insurance industry is also encountering the same difficulties as the banking industry. In the past, the huge premiums collected by the insurance industry were mostly invested in real estate and securities. Now that times have changed, how to use these funds is the most important issue for today's insurance industry.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the insurance department of the Central Trust Bureau, the government's property has been insured with the trust bureau. Recently, there have been rumors that the government will control the insurance industry. At present, it cannot be verified, but it is not easy to say what the future will be like when all industries are strictly controlled.</p>
<p>Recently, the actual premium income of fire and water insurance has been declining due to fierce competition among peers. Chinese and foreign companies have found it difficult to make profits, so they have established methods for registering insurance brokers and restricting commissions, in order to reduce commissions and increase premiums. This is a serious issue related to thousands of insurance brokers. It is said that brokers have also organized a guild to express their views on the methods established by the Chinese and foreign guilds.</p>
<p>Supplement 1. Under the aforementioned Chinese insurance companies, Baofeng and Taishan, although there are foreign shareholdings, Chinese shares account for the absolute majority, and they are all registered with the Chinese government and managed by Chinese, so they are purely Chinese-operated in nature.</p>
<p>2. In addition to Mr. Zhu Yanbin, there are also six Chinese managers of the North American Insurance Company: Wu Guangfu, Zheng Xuefang, Cai Heqing, Sun Wenqing, Wang Wenmei, and Huang Dingliang.</p>
<p>Correction: In the aforementioned Baofeng Insurance Company, it was said that "although the capital is small, the business is very good," but it was mistakenly typed as "although the capital is small, the business is very light". We have to correct it. (End)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Notes on What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Chen Xi)</p>
<p>On a spring night, I went for a stroll on the road with a friend and walked past a Cantonese restaurant. We went in to look for snacks. Embedded in the velvet glass was a seasonal menu, which read: "Apricot Essence Brain-Boosting Juice, Huai Essence Pig Trotter Soup, Magu Chicken Feet Soup..." I was really baffled. Later, after asking the waiter, I learned that "Apricot Essence Brain-Boosting Juice" was another name for pig brains, and "Huai Essence Pig Trotter Soup" was a euphemism for tendon soup. However, the top-notch Cantonese, why not write the original name? This, smart Chinese people know, because without the embellishment of these artistic words, it cannot be considered elegant or exaggerated. Therefore, in small restaurants in rural villages, there is also Dongpo pork for people to gobble up. I remember that Ms. Buck, in her novel "The Good Earth", described a medicine in a Chinese drugstore called "Dragon Bone", but when she bought it and looked at it, it turned out to be a "dog bone". She suspected the hypocrisy of Chinese medicine. In fact, her suspicion is clearly not understanding our elegance.</p>
<h3>Noodle Fish</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Noodle fish are a special aquatic product in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, near the Songkou area, and are most abundant in Wusongkou. This fish is about three inches long and as thick as a ten-year-old child's finger. The whole body is translucent silver-white, hence the name silver fish. But Shanghai people call it "noodle fish". The whole body has only a slender backbone, but it is very crisp and tender, and there is no danger of choking. By folding the fish head with the neck, you can easily pull out the fish intestines. In addition, the whole body is fresh, delicious, and fleshy.</p>
<p>According to folk legends, noodle fish is the transformation of Mrs. Meng Jiangnu, the wife of Fan Xiliang, who is famous in unofficial history for seeking her husband for thousands of miles. Because she did not submit to Qin Shihuang's despicable seduction, she angered the First Emperor and was crushed into meat paste and poured into the heart of the river. Her chaste soul did not dissipate and turned into noodle fish. Another saying is that on the eighth day of the second lunar month of the abolished calendar, the birthday of Zhang Da Emperor, who is not seen in the scriptures, he cooked several large pots of noodles. Because he couldn't finish them all at once, he dumped the whole pot at Wusongkou, where he was stationed. Immortal things must have some immortal energy, so the noodles turned into noodle fish. Another saying is that Lu Daoye, one of the Eight Immortals, returned from Zhang Da Emperor's birthday celebration. Riding the wind, he vomited both wine and noodles on the banks of the Yangtze River when he passed Jiangyin. Coincidentally, Monk Ji Dian also came out of Zhang's mansion. Responding to the fun, he pointed his hand and chanted the six-character mantra, turning a pile of dirty noodles into countless noodle fish. Another saying is that on February 28, an old monk traveling with a large number of coffins suddenly felt a strange itch on his body while crossing the river. He reached out and scratched, and it turned out to be a handful of old white lice. So he shook his hand and threw them into the river, where they turned into noodle fish. So noodle fish are on the market in the third lunar month of the abolished calendar.</p>
<p>These are just Qi Dong's wild words, and naturally not worth laughing at. Although there is no relevant book on the textual research of noodle fish for reference, it is undoubtedly true that the fish are produced in the East China Sea and flood into Wusongkou with the waves. If you go to Wusong to play in the spring when noodle fish are produced, and it happens to be high tide, it is not difficult to see a large fleet of fishing boats active on the sea, catching noodle fish. Noodle fish, in the sea, swim by interlocking their tails, in groups of ten or even dozens. Therefore, fishermen can quickly catch half a cabin and sell them in the fish market in Wusong Town, and then sell them to retail customers. If tourists are interested, they can buy a few pounds back and make noodle fish cakes with eggs, noodle fish soup with bamboo shoots, or prepare them in other ways. The taste is delicious, and it goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Scallions and Garlic</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>An old friend, Mr. Huang, wrote from North China, mentioning the difference in size between scallions and garlic in the north and south. I've transcribed it below to inform those compatriots who haven't been to North China.</p>
<p>Scallions and garlic add fragrance and color to food, so most Chinese people love them. However, Southerners always add "大" (dà, big) when calling garlic, saying "大蒜" (dà suàn, big garlic), while calling scallions simply "葱" (cōng). Northerners, on the other hand, always add "大" (dà, big) when calling scallions, saying "大葱" (dà cōng, big scallion), while calling garlic simply "蒜" (suàn). This is something I've long been accustomed to, always suspecting that "大" (dà, big) was an antonym to "小" (xiǎo, small), meaning that if there was a "大" (dà, big), there must be a "小" (xiǎo, small) counterpart. Recently, because I've been staying in North China, I've seen scallions sold in the market that are almost as thick as a child's arm, each a single stalk without clustered branches, one foot three or four inches long, with very few leafy parts. When preparing dishes, people discard the leaves and take the stalk, which has a very fragrant and delicious taste. The thickest ones weigh half a kilogram with just two or three stalks, which is very different from the clustered and thin scallions like chives produced in the South. Only then did I realize why Northerners always add "大" (dà, big) when calling scallions, to distinguish them from the small scallions produced in the South. Subsequently, I paid attention to garlic, and found that the garlic heads produced in the North are only the size of longans, and when you peel them, they contain fifteen or sixteen small cloves. The larger cloves are only as thick as bean sprouts, and the smallest ones are as thin as rice grains, which is very different from the plump garlic cloves as thick as thumbs produced in the South. Then I realized why Southerners always add "大" (dà, big) when calling garlic, to distinguish them from the small garlic produced in the North!</p>
<h3>Yellow Flower Wheat Cake</h3>
<p>— Ma Fosheng</p>
<p>"Yellow Flower Wheat Cake"—what a delightful name! I believe I don't even need to ask those who have eaten it how it tastes. I'm afraid that even those who have never tasted it will drool just hearing the name!</p>
<p>Yellow Flower Wheat Cake is not the fruit of a plant; it's a rice cake made with a wild vegetable (tender yellow flowers) and rice flour. Although "Yellow Flower Wheat Cake" is a misnomer, its fragrant aroma, the soft and delicate cake, and the emerald green color probably truly live up to the beautiful name "Yellow Flower Wheat Cake"!</p>
<p>In my hometown—the countryside of Shaoxing—it's currently the season for eating Yellow Flower Wheat Cake, and almost everyone loves it. So we have this folk song: "Yellow Flower Wheat Cake, chewy and firm, close the door and eat it yourself; don't give half a piece away, eat the whole piece alone." This shows how much people love it. But Yellow Flower Wheat Cake is not a commercial product; you can't taste its deliciousness unless you pick and make it yourself.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often ate Yellow Flower Wheat Cake made by my mother; back then, my brothers and I would often fight over it. Now it's time to eat Yellow Flower Wheat Cake again; I think of the Yellow Flower Wheat Cake from my hometown, and at the same time, I miss my mother who has passed away; instead, it evokes my sadness. Alas! Will I ever be able to eat Yellow Flower Wheat Cake made by my mother's hands again?</p>
<h3>Swapped Nests of Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter One: Sipping Tea and Making Idle Chat by the Night Window Listening to the Rain – Plucking Branches, Beautiful Shadows, Flower Scrolls Streaming Fragrance</p>
<p>Ping Shan walked into the room and saw that pen and ink had already been arranged on the desk. He laughed and said, "I've come at the wrong time; you're just about to write an article, and I'm here to disturb you." Guoqi laughed and said, "No one is forcing me to submit my paper today. I can write it tonight, or tomorrow night, or the night after, it doesn't matter. I'm bored on a rainy night, and I was just looking for something to pass the time. You've come, and we can sit and chat, which is perfect." Ping Shan was a man in his twenties, wearing a tweed coat, which complemented his round face, large eyes, and thick hair, giving him the appearance of being both generous and honest. Because Guoqi had said that he wasn't in a hurry to write an article, he didn't hesitate at all and sat down in the armchair by the desk. He saw the plaster statue of Venus and laughed, "Your desk is antique and elegant, how can you have this Greek goddess mixed in, bringing a touch of European influence?" Guoqi poured a cup of tea and handed it to him, saying, "A cup of tea serves as wine for a guest on a cold night, drink it first, and I'll explain." Ping Shan really drank the cup of tea. Guoqi said, "Isn't a figure from Greek mythology considered ancient?" Ping Shan said, "Ancient is naturally ancient. But the material used to make this statue, plaster, is a bit too modern." Guoqi had nothing to say to this and sat down with a smile in a chair opposite him. Ping Shan said, "I think, this Venus, since she is the goddess of beauty, and also the goddess of love, you need such a goddess to help you in your dry and dull life. However, this goddess herself is unfortunate, forced to marry an evil god. She's in charge of love, but she can't control her own love. Do you want to entrust your fate to her?" Guoqi laughed, "That's not the case. Even if I'm superstitious, I wouldn't be so blindly Western. I think this goddess is a bit poetic, so I put her on the desk. In both Western and Chinese mythology, goddesses are never so completely happy. Like our Weaver Girl and Chang'e, aren't they all people with unhappy marriages?" Ping Shan laughed, "Even so, you shouldn't put such an unlucky goddess on your desk. Because you are at the peak of your youth, you should put the Old Man Under the Moon on your desk and let him choose a virtuous lady for you." Guoqi shook his head and said, "You're still mentioning this? My mother just mentioned this to me, and I feel like it's not the time to talk about it now. Let's not talk about the burden of family, which we don't want to bear. Where can we find a woman who is both beautiful and loves literature and medicine, the kind of woman we have in mind? Even if there is one, why would she marry a poor scholar like me? So, from my own perspective and from the other person's perspective, getting married is not an easy thing for me." Ping You looked at his face and saw that his cloth robe was completely wrinkle-free. Even the cuffs of his sleeves were free of ink stains. (16)</p>
<h3>Toona Sinensis Shoots</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>On the counter of the southern goods store, in front of the hidden signboard, the several plates displayed always contain salted asparagus, green-headed salted turnip slices, black salted mustard greens, and at the same time, there is always a plate of dark green salted toona sinensis shoots. Salted toona sinensis shoots are a wonderful accompaniment to congee, containing considerable freshness within their salty and astringent taste. If, after a drunken feast, you add half a bowl of thin congee and eat it with salted toona sinensis shoots, you can appreciate a unique flavor. In the blink of an eye, spring turns to summer, and the weather becomes hotter day by day. Eating tea-soaked rice with salted toona sinensis shoots is not only refreshing and palatable, but also better for the digestion of the stomach than eating big fish and meat. In my hometown, it's quite popular to chop salted toona sinensis shoots into fine pieces and mix them into tofu with soy sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, etc., to be eaten as a side dish or with wine, and the taste is really good.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of salted goods they are, they are naturally all made from fresh goods with salt, such as salted meat, salted fish, salted eggs, salted vegetables, etc. Salted toona sinensis shoots are no exception, and are naturally also made from fresh toona sinensis shoots with salt. However, fresh toona sinensis shoots are not as widely popular as salted toona sinensis shoots, so not many people probably recognize fresh toona sinensis shoots or have tasted their flavor.</p>
<p>Fresh toona sinensis shoots are the newly sprouted leaves of the woody toona tree, and are completely bright red. When the leaves get a little older, they gradually turn green. So when picking toona sinensis shoots, the latest you can wait is when the tender branches have grown about three inches long, and are about to turn green, then you have to pick them. In these fresh toona sinensis shoots, there is a peculiar fragrance, and the tenderer they are, the stronger the flavor. Because fresh toona sinensis shoots sprout from the branches at the same time that fresh bamboo shoots emerge from the ground, cooking fresh bamboo shoots and tender tofu together with fresh toona sinensis shoots (the fresh toona sinensis shoots must be added last, to prevent the fragrance from diminishing due to high heat) can be said to be the only garden-style delicacy in late spring, which I think can be directly compared with fresh fish. Adding some fresh toona sinensis shoot shavings to scrambled eggs with bamboo shoots also tastes quite good. If you mix fresh toona sinensis shoot shavings into heated lard and let it solidify, it can be stored for a long time without spoiling. Even in the autumn, you can still enjoy dishes of fresh toona sinensis shoots for guests; it's very flavorful.</p>
<p>Fresh toona sinensis shoots are rarely sold in the vegetable markets of Shanghai. Things are valued for their rarity, so their price is very expensive, perhaps even more expensive than seasonal wolfberry shoots. At the same time, there is also a type of fresh tender tree branches that have the exact same shape and color as fresh toona sinensis shoots, but without the fragrance, which are sold as substitutes for fresh toona sinensis shoots. Therefore, when buying them, you must use both your eyes and nose, so that you are not mistaken.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Carp</h3>
<p>— Jing Renfang</p>
<p>The Yellow River's only specialty is the "Yellow River Carp," famous far and wide and renowned since ancient times. The Yellow River Carp's fame also has a peculiar story. Legend has it that during the Song Dynasty, in the "Longmenkou" (Dragon Gate Gorge) area of Luoyang, Henan (dug by Yu the Great when controlling the floods), the terrain was very steep, with cliffs facing each other. At that time, the Yellow River basin was often at its peak flow. At Longmenkou, there was a huge rock protruding from the water surface. When carp swam to it, they were unable to advance because they were blocked, so they leaped over it. It is still like this today, and the saying "carp leaping over the Dragon Gate" has been passed down as a good story by later generations. Kaifeng, Henan, is adjacent to the Yellow River basin, and transportation is very convenient, so the price of Yellow River Carp is not very expensive. Ordinary people can often taste its flavor. The best Yellow River Carp, with the freshest and most tender meat, is produced in the area from Shanzhou to Lanfeng Tongwaxiang in Henan Province. Its scales are golden and bright, its taste is fresh, and its flesh is fine. It has long been famous.</p>
<p>The season for Yellow River Carp to appear on the market can be said to be continuous, 360 days a year, they are available every day. Even on days of severe cold and freezing, when it is impossible to catch them, the fish market does not stop selling them. This is because fishermen work hard to catch them in late autumn, and the remaining fish are all raised in ponds, using water protection methods to prevent freezing. Every morning, they feed them fish food such as worms. In this way, the fish grow almost as well as they do living in the river. In winter, the fishermen sell them on the market, but the price is not less than about 30 cents per catty for live carp, and not less than about 20 cents per catty for dead carp.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Henan-style restaurants also sell "Yellow River Carp," and they are all lively and fresh, but the price is very expensive, with each slightly larger one costing two or three yuan. The method of transporting them requires a lot of effort. First, the fishmongers put the Yellow River Carp into a specially made fish tank with water, and transport it by the Longhai Railway to Xuzhou, then transfer to the Jinpu Railway to Shanghai, then cross the river to the Shanghai section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. The journey takes no less than two nights and two days, but the fish can still maintain their lives, naturally because they are well protected!</p>
<p>There are many ways to cook Yellow River Carp. Now I will write down a few of the methods that I know:</p>
<p>Sweet and Sour Glazed Method: First, kill the live Yellow River Carp by slamming it. Wash away the dirt with boiling water, put it in a boiling oil pot, and when it is almost cooked, add sugar, vinegar, and starch paste, pour it over the fish, and it will taste sweet and sour.</p>
<p>Red-Braised Method: First, kill the live carp by slamming it. Wash away the dirt with boiling water, put it in a boiling oil pot, and when it is cooked, add longan soup, Shaoxing wine, salt, and soy sauce, and pour it over the fish. It will taste fresh, and the soup will be rich. The taste is very good.</p>
<p>Soy Sauce Method: Put it in the pot to cook as before, and when it is cooked, take the best soy sauce, wine, and scallion whites and starch paste, pour it into the pot, and it will be ready in a short time. It will taste like pickled shrimp and be very palatable. Clear Steaming Method: First, kill the live carp by slamming it. Wash away the dirt with boiling water, put it in a steaming basket, and place it on the pot to steam over high heat, separated from the water. When it is almost cooked, combine scallion pieces, ginger juice, and fragrant vinegar and starch paste, pour it over the fish. The taste will be fresh, spicy, and slightly stimulating.</p>
<h3>Red Embroidered Shoes</h3>
<p>— Xi Kan</p>
<p>Recently, an old Mrs. Lu passed away in our hometown. She was a big landlord who owned more than 4,000 mu of land. Her superior life and widespread reputation go without saying. On the day of her funeral, I also went to the funeral due to family relations. From the mouths of many mourners, I heard about this old lady's deathbed testament.</p>
<p>When she was about to die, she gathered all the family members in front of her, and while tearfully saying goodbye forever, she ordered her two daughters-in-law to open the leather suitcase at the head of the bed. The children suspected that the old lady had kept some treasures or money, and scrambled to see it. But they found that the suitcase was full of hundreds of pairs of three-inch red embroidered shoes without heels. The old lady, struggling to maintain her spirits, looked at the red embroidered shoes and said:</p>
<p>"I came to your family when I was seventeen, and the old master died when I was twenty-one. The family wanted to plot against my share of the property, causing a lot of trouble. But I relied on you two," she looked at her two sons in their fifties, "You were only two or three years old at that time. So I decided to remain a widow... What is the hardship of remaining a widow? Look at this suitcase of red embroidered shoes," she looked down at the inside of the suitcase, "These hundreds of pairs of red embroidered shoes without heels were all rubbed and worn out on the mat when I couldn't sleep at night, especially in the early hours of the morning! I am seventy-six years old this year," she said with a sigh, "Relatives and neighbors all say that I am blessed and long-lived, but who knows the suffering in my heart during the twenty-odd years from twenty-one to forty-five!" She paused, "In the future, if you want to be filial to me, within the Lu family, whether it is a daughter-in-law or a daughter, after her husband dies, never let them remain widows, remarry quickly, you must remember my words!" After saying that, she died.</p>
<p>From Mrs. Lu's testament, we can clearly see the true face of the issue of chastity. Maintaining chastity is against people's will, it is hideous, and it is man-eating. We don't need any grand articles to prove this. This story of red embroidered shoes, I hope that the pillars of society will also learn from old Mrs. Lu, and use their own experiences and suffering to awaken later generations, so as not to repeat the same mistakes.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Stipulates to Implement Attention to Chinese Characters from July 1st</h3>
<p>Elementary school textbooks must be adopted, otherwise the Ministry of Education will never approve them.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously adopted the suggestions of the National Language Unification Preparation Committee in order to promote compulsory education and increase the efficiency of literacy among the people, and stipulated that attention should be paid to Chinese characters. The situation has been repeatedly recorded in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Ministry of Education recently announced that it will be implemented from July 1st of this year. The measures to promote the implementation of attention to Chinese characters are recorded as follows: (1) The characters used in textbooks for people's schools and short-term elementary schools shall be entirely attention characters. (2) The new character list in the Chinese textbooks for primary elementary schools shall be entirely attention characters. (3) The social studies and nature textbooks for primary elementary schools, and the Chinese, social studies, nature, and hygiene textbooks for senior elementary schools shall be entirely attention characters. (4) At the beginning of the first semester of the first grade of primary elementary school, attention symbols should be taught first. After practice is proficient, then teach the Chinese text. In the future, all newly compiled elementary school Chinese textbooks should be compiled with a separate phonetic book before the first volume, dedicated to attention symbols, and compiled into stories for teaching purposes. The teaching method should be based on first combining and then analyzing. The above regulations, in areas where there is a shortage of teachers to teach attention symbols, may be temporarily changed by the local education administrative agency. (5) From July 1936, all newly compiled textbooks and graphic books for elementary schools and people's schools must comply with these measures, otherwise they will not be approved. (6) All normal schools at all levels in the provinces and cities should teach attention symbols so that normal school graduates have the skills to teach attention symbols. (7) During the transition period, all elementary schools must extract a part of the time in the Chinese language course to focus on teaching attention symbols. (8) From January 1936, all editors of children's and people's reading materials must use phonetic Chinese characters for printing. (9) The Ministry and the educational administrative organs of the provinces and cities should urge all newspapers to use phonetic Chinese characters for printing as much as possible within the possible scope.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Fujian Education Expenses</h3>
<p>More than 1.9 million this year, compulsory education will increase to more than 400,000.</p>
<p>(Xiamen Communication) Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Fujian Education Department, departed from Fuzhou to Xiamen to attend the Xiamen University Board of Directors and arrived on the 27th. It is said that on May 3rd and 4th, he will go to Beijing to attend the administrative commissioners' meeting of education department chiefs from ten provinces. Regarding the province's education expenses, he intends to request the central government to increase the amount of subsidies. The province's education expenses are about 1.89 million yuan per year. Fuzhou has provincial complete middle schools, girls' middle schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools that all required verification. After I took office, I merged the four schools, and now I can save costs, and their functions are also the same. This year, the province has added ten high schools, such as Yongchun, Changting, and Nanping Middle Schools, Longxi and Longyan Rural Normal Schools, Dehua, Nanping, Fuan, and Changle Vocational Schools, and Mindong produces tea, so a tea vocational school is established. Dehua produces porcelain, so a porcelain vocational school is established. Longxi Vocational School is for chemical and civil engineering, creating talents suitable for local needs. Starting from the autumn of 1936, all provincial primary and secondary schools in the province will be exempt from tuition fees, and in the future, it is planned to exempt all food and miscellaneous fees as well. The 1936 education expense budget is 1.9 million yuan, while the 1935 final account was 1.8 million yuan, an increase of only 100,000 yuan, but the subsidy for compulsory education in each county has doubled for the province. The Ministry of Education subsidized 110,000 yuan last year, and the provincial government subsidized 125,000 yuan. This year, the provincial government budget can be doubled, totaling 250,000 yuan. I plan to ask the Ministry for a double increase during this trip to Beijing, to 220,000 yuan. After the recovery of the bandit areas in the province, a total of 22 counties in eastern Fujian, western Fujian, and northern Fujian have established 130 Sun Yat-sen People's Schools to handle special education and organized "itinerant teaching groups." Since October last year, 1,800 short-term elementary schools have been opened throughout the province, and people's literacy schools have been opened in 60 counties, etc.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Rectifies the Slaughter Tooth Education Fee</h3>
<p>The slaughter and tooth taxes in Jiangsu education expenses amount to more than 1.4 million yuan per year, accounting for about one-third of the total education expenses in Jiangsu Province. The slaughter and tooth taxes are mostly contracted out to merchants through bidding by the Jiangsu Education Expenses Management Office. The office is earnestly rectifying tax collection and preventing merchants from using aliases to bid in order to avoid abuses. Yesterday, it issued separate orders to the magistrates of 61 counties, stating that if merchants used names or numbers, or even aliases, to bid for the slaughter and tooth taxes, it would be impossible to investigate when taxes were owed. The original merchants are spared discussion in order to comply with the legal principle of not retroactively applying the law. From the date of this announcement, merchants who bid for the slaughter and tooth taxes in the future must fill in the names recorded in the household registration book and may not arbitrarily fill in aliases. If it is found after winning the bid that the name of the person sent to investigate does not match the name in the household registration book, the right to bid should be revoked at any time to clarify responsibility and prevent abuses. In addition to announcing this to the public during the bidding for slaughter and tooth taxes in each county and distributing it separately, it is appropriate to order the county magistrates to be informed. The office also issued an order to the supervising commissioners stationed in each county, stating that merchants often use aliases to bid for the slaughter and tooth taxes. When taxes are owed and the bid is revoked, the county is ordered to summon and investigate, but there is no such person. Therefore, once a new merchant wins the bid, they should fill out a resume and attach a half-length photograph to show solemnity. In addition, the two stores that guarantee must be responsible, and the investigation must be carried out carefully and not perfunctorily. If the name does not match or the store is not solid, the commissioner will be held accountable. In addition to distributing this separately, it is appropriate to order the commissioner to comply.</p>

This kind of work of saving the country and preserving its existence is not only seeking the revitalization of the national spirit, but at the same time, it should pay more attention to the issue of people's livelihood. The work of the Association after its establishment is to focus on the four words of people's livelihood education, create products for the country, and at the same time create products for the people, so that the people and the country have abundant materials.

<p>Finally, Jiang Jianyu, a guest, gave a speech, briefly stating that the China Industry Education Society and the Civil Livelihood Education have the same purpose, and in the future, they will work together to seek educational development. What is the purpose of education? I often have doubts, such as how students who graduate from high school or junior high school who cannot continue their studies due to various reasons can obtain production technology. Students who graduate from elementary school or middle school cannot continue their studies, but enter factories or shops to learn, but their desire for knowledge is extremely strong, how should we use educational power to help them. Students who have received university or specialized education and have no suitable jobs, how can we arrange for them. These are all necessary works in civil livelihood education. If they can be arranged properly, the country and individuals will benefit. Otherwise, both the country and individuals will suffer. In my opinion, in order to solve the first problem, it is advisable to run a living vocational school and devise methods for students based on their environment. The second problem is to run supplementary education, but the supplementary education here must also be living. The third problem is to make students develop the power to create their own careers. The school authorities should devise methods for them, and the education community should cooperate with the banking community in order to promote the convenience of this education. I don't know if you gentlemen of the Association think so. After Jiang's speech, the election of directors began. Due to time constraints, the list was not announced.</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the American Acceptance Market</h3>
<p>— Liu Kongjun</p>
<p>The market for bank acceptances in the United States is a recent development. Before the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, national banks were not allowed to engage in the business of accepting drafts. The limited acceptance credit that existed was created by a few state banks, large investment banks, and private banks. The drafters of the Federal Reserve Act, deeply aware that bank acceptances were the only method for financing trade, and that expanding the acceptance market would increase the strength and flexibility of the banking system, authorized member banks to engage in acceptance business, subject to the restrictions of various regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. The Act also stipulated that acceptances could be discounted with the Federal Reserve Banks according to the principle of necessity, and the Reserve Banks could buy and sell eligible acceptances in the public market.</p>
<p>It is universally believed that the development of acceptance business has been slow. However, by the end of 1917, the amount of outstanding acceptances in the United States had already reached more than $450 million. As banks and merchants gradually gained a considerable understanding of the technical aspects of acceptance credit, and due to the broad-minded approach of the Federal Reserve Act, the quantity of acceptances increased to a peak of $1,732.2 million by the end of 1929. In the following years, due to the impact of business depression, sharp price declines, and the reduction of international trade, the quantity of outstanding acceptances gradually contracted, reaching a total of only $543,385,000 by December 1934. The development of the acceptance market can be illustrated in the following table:</p>
<p>Table of Outstanding Bank Acceptances (in thousands of dollars)</p>
<p>Bank acceptances were originally used for the movement or storage of investment commodities. The Federal Reserve Act initially allowed member banks to accept drafts for financing imports and exports, and was later amended to include other transactions. The following table lists the amount of outstanding acceptances at the end of 1926 and 1929, and on August 31, 1934, classified according to their purpose.</p>
<p>Acceptances for financing imports and exports have accounted for the majority of outstanding acceptances in the United States in recent years. These acceptances, with their self-liquidating nature, are generally regarded as sound and stable. All acceptances for financing domestic shipments are also treated similarly because they represent actual sales.</p>
<p>Table of Types of Outstanding Bank Acceptances (in thousands of dollars)</p>
<p>Bank acceptances used to finance the storage of goods abroad, or the transportation of goods between foreign countries, have increased rapidly. At the end of 1930, the outstanding amount of this type of acceptance credit was $561,442,000, compared to $40,313,000 at the end of 1926. It is universally known that New York occupies an important position as an international financial center, and it has an unshirkable responsibility for financing international trade and internal transactions of foreign countries. However, without strict standards, its implementation is prone to abuses and endangers the drawer and the acceptor. The stagnation of a large amount of acceptance credit caused by the German standstill agreements is sufficient to illustrate the risk inherent in this type of investment.</p>
<p>Another major type of acceptance credit is that which is based on staple products in warehouses (domestic warehouse credit). In recent years, during the business depression, the reduction in the amount of outstanding acceptances for this purpose has often been less than that for other types, because goods in warehouses, used as a basis for financing before being transported and sold, cannot but be regarded as a stable method. The only concern is that improper use could fuel speculation.</p>
<p>The use of acceptances to create dollar exchange is a unique feature of the United States. It is a major tool for countries with seasonal exports, such as Central and South American countries, to create a surplus of dollars during periods of low exports. The drawer has the obligation to repay the acceptance to the accepting bank upon maturity, but because this payment comes from the proceeds of selling goods to the United States during peak export periods, and because this type of acceptance is not based on the actual transportation of goods, the Federal Reserve Board has formulated various regulations to restrict the activities of member banks.</p>
<p>There are three constituent elements in the acceptance market: the accepting institutions, the acceptance dealers, and the purchasers.</p>
<p>Member banks under the Federal Reserve System are the most important of the acceptance institutions. The Federal Reserve Act authorizes member banks to create acceptances up to one-half of their paid-up capital and surplus. However, with the permission of the Federal Reserve Board, member banks can also create acceptances equivalent to their entire capital and surplus. In addition, according to the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, they can accept drafts to create dollar exchange, equivalent to one-half of their capital. In addition to member banks, there are also many private banks, foreign banks, and American agencies of foreign banks engaged in the creation of acceptances.</p>
<p>For fifteen years, the American acceptance business has been concentrated in the hands of a few major financial institutions in New York, and the decision-making power lies with the financial institutions in the major cities of the East. When the Federal Reserve System was first established, many banks were attracted to engage in acceptance business. Between 1918 and 1921, a total of 500 institutions reported acceptance liabilities, including some in small inland cities. Later, because their acceptance volume was not sufficient to guarantee the necessary convenience, they successively gave up this sideline. On August 31, 1934, only 112 organizations reported acceptance liabilities. The geographic concentration of the acceptance business in New York can be proven by the fact that 80 percent of the outstanding acceptances on that day were created by the New York Federal Reserve District.</p>
<p>The institutions engaged in the creation of acceptances are classified as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Bank Categories Reporting Acceptances (August 31, 1934): National Banks 59</p>
<p>Trust Companies and State Banks 33 Private Banks 9</p>
<p>Foreign Banks 1</p>
<p>American Agencies of Foreign Banks 10 Total 112</p>
<p>Acceptance dealers consist of private banks and financial firms engaged in intermediary business in the financial market. They mainly deal in securities and acceptances, and some also act as brokers for commercial paper and as intermediaries for investing in mortgages and federal funds. Most are located in New York, and there are about ten firms engaged in large-scale acceptance business.</p>
<p>The function of the acceptance dealer is to purchase acceptances from the drawer, the accepting institution, or other holders, and distribute them to investors. The acceptance dealer sends daily lists to purchasers, detailing the date, denomination, serial number, and interest rate of the acceptances. The acceptance dealer purchases acceptances directly and sells them at a higher price, profiting from the difference, with the selling price usually being one-eighth to one-quarter of one percent higher than the purchase price. Acceptances sold to the Federal Reserve Bank must be endorsed, but those sold to other purchasers are not endorsed unless specifically requested. The interest rate on acceptances endorsed by an acceptance dealer is usually lower. The standard price quoted by acceptance dealers for eligible acceptances endorsed by banks with excellent credit is usually uniform, but the price quoted for ineligible acceptances or those endorsed by unknown banks is always higher.</p>
<p>The main purchasers of bank acceptances are commercial banks and Federal Reserve Banks, as well as savings banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions. Acceptances issued in accordance with the Federal Reserve Act are generally regarded as the safest and most liquid short-term credit instruments. Commercial banks can use acceptances as their secondary reserves, and the investment of savings banks and insurance companies in bank acceptances has been approved by the legislation of most state governments.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank is a major player in the acceptance market, not only buying acceptances on its own account at a fixed price, but also acting as an agent for foreign correspondents to purchase acceptances, and entering into repurchase agreements with acceptance dealers, stipulating that the acceptance dealers repurchase the acceptances they sold within fifteen days. The Reserve Bank's purchase of acceptances during the clearing period stabilizes the market and reduces the risk for acceptance dealers to hold assets. Usually, the Reserve Bank purchases acceptances after the bank, acceptance dealer, or other holder has held them for several weeks. The acceptances purchased from acceptance dealers usually account for one-third to one-half of the total number of acceptances, with the remainder being purchased from banks. If the acceptances purchased under repurchase agreements are excluded, then the acceptances purchased from banks usually account for three-quarters of the total.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank's purchase of acceptances on its own account is only a passive function. The purchase of part or all of the acceptances is handled according to the fixed price, and it does not offer prices in the market or sell the acceptances it holds. However, the reserve credit expanded as a result is subject to closer supervision by the reserve authorities than discounting. If the fixed purchase price is lower than the market interest rate for acceptances, it can absorb a large supply of acceptances. Conversely, if the purchase price is higher than the market interest rate, the supply of acceptances will decrease, and the Reserve Bank's acceptance holdings will decrease accordingly as the acceptances mature.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Reserve Bank, acting as an agent for foreign correspondents to purchase acceptances, is often an active bidder in the acceptance market. To quickly fulfill the mission entrusted by the foreign central bank, the price it offers is often one-eighth of one percent higher than the price it purchases for its own account. The endorsement fee it adds to the acceptance is also one-eighth of one percent. Most of these acceptances are purchased directly from acceptance dealers, and their past influence on the market has been enormous. The acceptances held by the Reserve Bank on behalf of foreign correspondents have amounted to as much as one-third of the total outstanding acceptances. In recent years, due to the confusion of currency conditions, the purchase of acceptances by foreign central banks has gradually declined. In the autumn of 1934, the number of acceptances held by the Reserve Bank on behalf of foreign correspondents was less than one million dollars.</p>
<p>Since the Reserve Bank is a major purchaser of acceptances, it goes without saying that its purchase price affects the public market. Usually, the public market interest rate for 90-day acceptances in New York is the same as or slightly higher than the Reserve Bank's interest rate, but this relationship is often influenced by the Reserve Bank's purchase policy and other factors. If the Reserve Bank cannot freely purchase acceptances, it should raise the market interest rate to encourage the needs of other purchasers. If banks have a strong need for acceptances, the market interest rate will be lower than the Reserve Bank's interest rate.</p>
<p>The distribution of bank acceptances to various purchasers is largely determined by prevailing market conditions. Whenever there is a tight money market and high interest rates, banks reduce their acceptance holdings and use the proceeds for other purposes. At this time, a large amount of outstanding acceptances are transferred to the Reserve Bank. Conversely, when market interest rates are low and banks find it difficult to utilize their surplus funds, they are more willing to purchase accepted drafts. The bank's acceptance holdings increase greatly due to its purchases in the public market.</p>
<p>Thus, at the end of July 1929, the Reserve Bank's acceptance holdings (including those purchased for its own account and those purchased on behalf of foreign correspondents) accounted for 47 percent of the total outstanding acceptances. Conversely, at the end of July 1934, the Reserve Bank's acceptance holdings were only about one million dollars, of which $500,000 were purchased for its own account. At the same time, the acceptance banks' holdings accounted for 91 percent of the total outstanding acceptances. In April 1934, as the supply of acceptances in the market decreased, acceptance dealers formulated different interest rates to resist banks from purchasing their own acceptances from drawers. The recent changes in the distribution of acceptances can be outlined in the following table.</p>

<h3>Factors That Make the French Franc Unstable</h3>
<p>— Mo Yin</p>
<p>In the midst of a world economic panic during a general crisis, Poland has already departed from the remaining gold standard bloc. The French franc, considered to be the leader, has been repeatedly shaken, but has finally stabilized. However, bank runs, the frantic outflow of gold reserves, the fall of the franc's exchange rate against foreign currencies, the increase in the bank discount rate, and the slight increase in the domestic price index all indicate the possibility of being forced to abandon the gold standard and devalue the franc. Now, the results of the French parliamentary elections show a strong trend towards the left. The future of the franc depends on the policies of the newly formed cabinet.</p>
<p>The main reason why France abandoned the gold franc system later than countries like England, America, and Japan is because the economic panic in France occurred relatively later. From 1929 to 1933, when the economic panic in the world's capitalist countries was at its most severe, the degree of economic panic in France was relatively moderate. Naturally, this is related to the fact that France's production was severely damaged during the war and its economy needed to be restored. The development of a serious economic panic in France began largely after the end of 1931, and it can be said that it has not yet reached its peak (other capitalist countries reached their peak in 1932). Therefore, the issue of the instability of the French gold standard only gradually became serious after 1933. Another reason why France could not but maintain the gold standard in the past is because the result of France's inflation after the war had already cost the people four-fifths of their property. Currently, a considerable number of people in France live on interest income, so the majority of French people fundamentally oppose devaluing the currency and inflation. However, forcibly maintaining the gold standard has resulted in the destruction of the French economy reaching its current serious state.</p>
<p>The flaws that have now emerged in the French economy can be summarized as follows: First, the domestic price level has fallen relatively and absolutely, and the industrial production index has therefore only decreased. Therefore, after 1932, although the capitalist countries have already embarked on a stage of recession, the existence of the gold standard has finally allowed the panic to continue to develop. Now, if we assume that the total index of French industrial production in 1913 was 100, then the average for 1934 was 78. By August of last year, except for the May index falling to 72.4, all months were at 73.2, which is significantly lower than the 76.4 in August of the previous year. At the same time, the decline in prices also presents a terrifying downward trend. If we take 1929 as 100, the wholesale price of French industrial products in 1930 was 88.04, in 1931 it was 80, in 1932 it was 68.2, in 1933 it was 60.0, in 1934 it was 54.0, and in 1935 it was 5.7. This downward trend fully demonstrates that the development of the economic panic in France is more obvious than in any other country. Not only have the prices of industrial products plummeted in this way, but the prices of agricultural products, which occupy an important position in France's total production, have also fallen continuously. The prices of wheat, sugar, wine, butter, beef, eggs, etc. all trended downwards in 1935 compared to 1934. Second, because the price of the franc is too high, the absolute decrease in French exports and the relative increase in the number of import surpluses in foreign trade have further aggravated the economic panic in France. If we compare the total value of French imports and exports in 1935 with the total value in 1934, in 1934, the total value of French exports was 2.909 billion francs, which decreased to 2.354 billion francs in 1935. The total value of imports in 1934 was 3.325 billion francs, which decreased to 3.0206 billion francs in 1935. The total import surplus in 1934 was 4.016 billion francs, which increased to 8.52 million francs in 1935, a doubling. The reason for the gradual decline in trade exports is undoubtedly that the price of the franc is too high, which prevents production costs from being reduced. Therefore, it is not easy to sell French products in overseas markets. The sharp decline in French exports is not only the case in the markets of various capitalist countries, but the markets in French colonies are also gradually being crowded out by other countries. Third, the financial difficulties and the increase in deficits in France have become more serious due to the gold standard. In 1930-1931, the French fiscal deficit was 3 billion francs, and in 1933 it was 10 billion francs. Although it is impossible to foresee how much the budget deficit will be in 1935-1936, experts estimate that the deficit will reach a huge amount of 20 billion francs. The reason why the French budget is so unbalanced is partly because the public debt issued in the past was too large (the total public debt is 300 billion francs), which requires the expenditure of huge amounts of interest each year, but on the other hand, the expansion of military preparations and huge military expenditures are also one of the main reasons. The reason for the gradual decline in revenue is naturally nothing more than the result of the economic panic. This is because the main source of France's national income does not come from the rich, but mostly from mass taxes, wage taxes, consumption taxes, and tariffs. The amount of these tax revenues is directly related to economic prosperity, so the poverty and increase in unemployment of the French people in recent years have affected the sharp decline in tax revenues. However, the maintenance of the franc standard only helps to fuel the flames of the economic panic, so the increase in the fiscal deficit is also related to the gold standard. In addition, the fact that the franc is too expensive, which reduces the consumption power of travelers in France, and the suspension of German war debts, have all worsened France's international balance of payments and made its finances more difficult.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points can be said to be the fundamental economic foundation for the expansion of franc instability, which is a necessary result of the inherent contradictions in the capitalist economy. Although France's gold reserves still rank second in the world, the current state of the franc is fundamentally shaken due to the development of the economic panic and the reduction of profit and income.</p>
<p>Recently, the stationing of German troops in the Rhine region and the tendency to actively prepare for war have directly shaken the political situation in Europe and France, and have concomitantly caused the financial panic in France to break out acutely. In addition, as a result of the internal economic panic, the conflicts of interest among various classes have become even more intense. Therefore, some people believe that the formation of a united front against the fascist faction is the most likely to deepen the rifts in the French political situation, causing the French rulers to seek a new weapon in the reform of the monetary system, that is, attempting to devalue the currency to alleviate France's economic panic and overcome financial difficulties. If it is unavoidable to abandon the gold standard in the near future, then the Netherlands and Switzerland will have to follow France's lead. The destruction of the last fortress of the gold standard bloc, and the temporary foreign trade benefits obtained by various capitalist countries in inflation, will be fundamentally eliminated. In this way, using war as a means to seize world markets will be re-adopted by the great powers and cause another human massacre, which is also to be expected. Therefore, along with the collapse of the gold standard bloc, the world will usher in a new situation. At the same time, the intensification of the sharp contradictions and opposition between classes within France, I think this is also unavoidable. Because if France abandons the franc standard, although there may be a chance to expand foreign trade, the reduction of the domestic market, such as the relatively low wages, etc., is also bound to happen. At the same time, the income of France's vast interest-bearing population will naturally be greatly reduced due to the devaluation of the currency, accelerating the shrinkage of the domestic market. In this way, the revival of the French economy is probably still a major problem.</p>

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rise Strongly</h3>
<p>From April 27th to May 2nd last week, the market price process of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange once experienced a reaction due to excessive gains and insufficient strength, but it was quickly quelled. The trend turned from suppression to rise. Absorption and bullish sentiment from various groups were even stronger than before. Observing the environment, the reasons for being bullish were still based on the dull and brewing situation, with no clear progress. Later, Chen's trip to the United States became stable, and the bullish side felt even more confident. There were also rumors in the market about cotton and wheat loans, and the rising trend became even stronger. Grades A and B broke the previous week's highest record. Grades C and D were on par with the previous week's highest price. Grade E also broke the previous week's high price. The trend is strong and firm, and there may still be a rising trend. Most of the market is looking at Grade A at 70, and inaction is not fast enough. Last week's process saw a sudden increase in selling pressure. No. 37 started to be released, and the June contract also came on the market. The market price dropped in a straight line. Trading was quite lively. The reaction was fierce, and it fell sharply by 78 cents to 30 cents. The week was the last week of the April futures delivery and the market was closed. On Wednesday, it turned firm again. Nos. 11 and 47 were bought. The market price rebounded by about half a yuan. On Thursday, the pulling force became stronger and stronger. Nos. 4, 11, and 15 continued to buy. Although No. 37 gradually stepped out of the scope, it still rose by 30 cents. Friday's trading was the clearest. Although the market price was chaotic, the Zhao trend was still firm. Saturday morning was flat, and there seemed to be a circling trend. In the afternoon, Nos. 5 and 71 suddenly had a large amount of absorption. Various types of contracts for all months were in demand. The market price rose sharply and firmly. Although Nos. 4 and 11 were released at a high price, Grades A and B still hit a new record high. The environmental situation is temporarily favorable to the bullish side. The future is not easy to fall sharply. The market price results are mostly slightly small at 30 cents for the May contracts, excluding the newly listed June contracts. The total transaction volume was 26,466,000 yuan. The following table compares the highest and lowest price fluctuations (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grain: River Rice Transactions Remain Normal</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups remained [unchanged]. Paper receipts were issued for over ten firms, with over four thousand piculs of goods. Sales in this street were sluggish, and the demand from Tianjin and Dalian groups had also eased. Only seven or eight hundred packages were purchased throughout the day, so the market remained stable. There were no significant gains or losses in the prices of thick early japonica rice or thin indica rice. The prices of "Du Yang Jian" and "Yin Bian Yuan" remained similar. The opening market quotations are listed below:</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, ten boats arrived from the river areas below [Shanghai]. The movement of goods in the market was normal. The market price of white japonica rice showed a weakening trend. Early indica rice prices were firm due to scarcity. Thin indica rice was also firm. The price of "Yin Bian Yuan" showed an upward trend. Other indica rice varieties were sluggish, with prices tending to soften. The prices of other goods generally remained stable.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sea Cucumber Market Exceptionally Firm</h3>

When large buyers appeared, there was a noticeable lack of variety. Market prices have thus gradually increased. Yesterday, it was heard that traders were offering Makassar plum blossom sea cucumber: three pieces for 222 yuan, four pieces for 194 yuan, six to eight pieces for 178 yuan, twelve pieces for 152 yuan, fifteen pieces for 135 yuan.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Both Old and New American Cotton Offered for Sale</h3>
<p>Market Weakened as a Result</p>
<p>Only Indian and British Cotton Saw Price Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with favorable news from Liverpool. Traders and foreign firms bought, and prices for all months increased by one to five "bang yin". Afterwards, long positions were closed, and some new cotton was offered for sale. Oklahoma received beneficial rain, and the market softened. Although May futures were not sold off, long positions in old cotton were closed and sold short. Demand was sluggish, and outside parties were hesitant. Current demand also showed no improvement. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures prices ranged from unchanged to down eight "bang yin". British cotton spot and futures prices increased by three points. Indian cotton short positions and speculators sold, but Japanese firms bought. "Pingguoer" and "Aomula" increased by 0.25 rupees, and "Bailuoxi" increased by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees.

<h3>Catarrh of the Stomach – Weak Stomach</h3>
<p>– Dai De</p>
<p>Gastric catarrh is divided into acute and chronic types. Acute cases often arise from overeating or consuming spoiled food, leading to vomiting and diarrhea. If not treated properly, it can develop into a chronic condition. Furthermore, using one's brain after meals or not chewing food adequately can easily trigger chronic gastric catarrh, causing indigestion, a weak stomach, and ultimately leading to physical exhaustion.</p>
<p>Through many years of clinical experience, I have found that the most effective stomach medicine is the German "Strong Stomach Essence." It has remarkable effects on all types of acute and chronic stomach ailments, indigestion, bloating after meals, hidden abdominal pain, belching sourness, noisy stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea with abdominal noises, loose stools, and constipation. It works quickly and effectively, with almost no failures. The medicine also contains the three most precious vitamins A, B, and D, which are particularly effective for beriberi and weakness. It also provides brain, blood, and strengthening nutrients. In addition, because the main ingredients are spleen extract (hormone) and lecithin, it is highly suitable for elderly constipation and smokers trying to quit. It is also very suitable as a year-round supplement.</p>
<h3>SPECIFISCHE BEHANDLUNG—</h3>
<p>The Most Effective Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Gonococci have a very strong resistance, so ordinary medicinal treatments are ineffective. Even if the surface area appears to be healed, the root of the disease still remains. Therefore, modern medicine advocates the use of a special treatment (SpecifischeBehanDung.), which takes the immune antibacterial bodies from the bodies of strong animals and applies chemical operations to successfully create the German anti-gonorrhea medicine "Kelinong". Proven through experiments in famous Western hospitals, this medicine has the power to cure gonorrhea, acute and chronic turbidity, prostatitis, arthritis, and orchitis! Four or five bottles are enough for cure, and no more than seven or eight bottles will be required for a complete cure! Moreover, it completely eradicates the disease, with no fear of recurrence! This is different from other local "transmembrane sterilization" drugs. However, special attention must be paid when purchasing to ensure that you are buying the real "Kelinong" three words, so as not to be deceived, and to avoid accidentally taking it, which could trigger danger! Vannod conducted a 20-day culture of gonococci, and when the immune element in the "Kelinong" ingredient was added, the gonococci developed poorly or did not develop at all, and eventually all died. Animal experiments have shown that the therapeutic effect is amazing. This is a new era in immunology! From this, the inventor of "Kelinong," Peter Biedel, received a doctorate degree, and to this day, the drug has spread to various countries.</p>
<h3>Annoying Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Jin Yueren</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is the most common disease for women and the most annoying disease for women. If not treated quickly, it can easily attract foreign bacteria, resulting in major problems, such as local erosion, stinging urination, inconvenience in walking, and even menstrual difficulties, swelling and pain in the lower abdomen, and induce insomnia. I have used the German "Carle Xue'erdi Vaginal Tablets" for this disease. Take one tablet as a suppository before going to bed to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and收歛 the lesions. If it comes from physical weakness, you can take "Bu Nü Rong" internally to strengthen the body and help stop the secretion. If it is caused by gonorrhea, you can take "Kelinong" internally to eliminate internal bacterial toxins. Such internal and external treatments complement each other, and the effect is greater. Therefore, treatment is often able to cure the disease completely in three to four weeks. The treatment is simple and fast. Therefore, the "Carle Xue'erdi Vaginal Tablets" are most suitable for women with leukorrhea to treat themselves at home.</p>
<h3>Long-term Stomach Ailments Cured</h3>
<p>— Contribution by Jiang Shuyu</p>
<p>I have always been physically weak, and in addition, my schoolwork was complicated, resulting in a weak stomach and distaste for food. I suffered from hidden, dull pain in the stomach, frequent nausea, and vomiting after tea. I felt upset and irritable in my chest, especially when I woke up in the morning and on an empty stomach. I suffered from dizziness, blurred vision, belching acid, and上氣. My body became thinner and thinner, and I gradually experienced mental weakness and insomnia. My complexion was withered and yellow, and the symptoms of decline were endless. I was repeatedly treated by doctors, but it was difficult to see any effect. Later, introduced by a friend, I was shown to take the German "Strong Stomach Essence" medicine. Before I had taken four bottles, my stomach felt lighter and more comfortable than ever before, and my spirits suddenly increased, and my appetite became stronger. I took five bottles in a row, and all my symptoms were miraculously cured. I gained weight, my muscles filled out, and I slept soundly at night. Weakness turned into strength. I am writing to express my gratitude and to ask you to publicize the efficacy of this medicine so that those who suffer from the same illness can know where to seek help. Those suffering from stomach ailments must take this medicine.</p>
<h3>German Gonorrhea Special Medicine Kelinong Experimental Photograph</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>(1) Suddenly mutated into cystitis</p>
<p>Patient Quan Zaiqiang, resident of a certain alley on Xiaoshadu Road, took medicine from a doctor after contracting gonorrhea, and felt slightly better. However, due to overexertion, he suddenly mutated into cystitis, with frequent and urgent urination, and a large number of pus cells and other things in the urine. He had lower abdominal pain and his body temperature rose. I begged to see a doctor and was immediately instructed to take "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and relieve pain. After taking "Kelinong" for three weeks, the inflammation and swelling gradually subsided, and urination became exceptionally clean, and everything returned to normal. After being stimulated by mad drinking and hard labor, there was no positive reaction. It was decided that it had been cured.</p>
<p>Husband and wife have the same disease</p>
<p>Patient Meng Jushan, 29 years old, married. After contracting gonorrhea, he was immediately infected by his wife. Therefore, both husband and wife were trapped by gonococci. Mr. Meng's disease had developed into prostatitis and orchitis, with swelling of the right testicle, and white discharge from the urethral opening, as well as difficult urination and dripping. There was blood in the urine. In addition to performing local massages and instructing him to use a testicular belt and rest, I also gave him the German anti-gonorrhea medicine "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation, swelling, and transmembrane kill gonococci. After taking it for almost a month, all the gonococci were completely swept away. His wife's leukorrhea was caused by the stimulation of toxins, and the erosion had extended to the deep part of the cervix. She was asked to quickly purchase "Carle Xue'erdi Vaginal Tablets", and take one tablet at bedtime and put it into the vagina as a suppository, so that the bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects directly acted on the area, and stopped secretion. She also took "Kelinong" internally to destroy the gonococci in the urethra. It took five weeks to fully recover. Both husband and wife were blood tested and showed no traces of gonorrhea, so they praised the effectiveness of the two drugs.</p>
<h3>Report on Endocrine Experiment of Dr. Chen Shaohua</h3>
<p>Sexual Neurasthenia in Both Sexes</p>
<p>Sexual neurasthenia in both sexes is a term that is lost to happiness in life. However, many people today do not love themselves. Often, during their development period, they commit the bad habit of masturbation, and after marriage, they are often indulgent and decadent. Even the body of gold and stone may sometimes be exhausted, let alone a body of flesh and blood? Young men and women, such as excessive destruction of the gonads, loss of hormones, so that many suffer from incomplete development. The symptoms common to both sexes include infertility after a long marriage, physical weakness, anemia, headaches, insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus, empty thoughts, hallucinations, anxiety, and boredom with work. Specific symptoms include nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, impotence, and cold and thin semen in men. Women suffer from delayed menstruation or advances and delays.</p>
<p>The most effective medicine for treating this disease is the German "Butikang" for men and "Bu Nü Rong" for women, invented by Merlin. These two drugs are made from the glands of youth, such as lions, tigers, sea dogs, and orangutans. It can replenish hormones in the body, promote the production of new blood cells, and strengthen reproductive gland cells. After taking it for three to several weeks, it can completely transform sexual tissue for all sexual neurasthenia, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, women's menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, insomnia, and infertility after a long marriage. It can also make the skin tender and white, and make the face plump and beautiful. I have used these two drugs to cure tens of thousands of people with sexual neurasthenia. Wang Guobin suffered from sexual neurasthenia and failed to take sperm-strengthening and brain-boosting drugs. He asked me for treatment. In addition to electrotherapy, I gave him a large amount of "Butikang". After taking four or five bottles in a row, the sexual tissue was transformed, and nocturnal emission, insomnia, forgetfulness, palpitations, and other symptoms were completely cured. Also, the number of women who have been cured of menstrual disorders and neurasthenia by using "Bu Nü Rong" is also large. Moreover, after recovery, the reproductive capacity of both men and women is strong.</p>

<h3>Clinical Report on Gonorrhea by Dr. Yao Juyin</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Consulting hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Almost turned into peritonitis due to gonorrhea</p>
<p>Men's gonorrhea, whether acute or chronic, is likely to be contracted by women after only one contact, if women are converted into chronic, such as lower abdominal pain, extending to the pelvis, it is necessary to prevent it from inducing fallopian tube and ovaritis, etc., causing damage to ovulation, leading to menstrual difficulties. If it is still not treated, there is always secondary peritonitis, and the prognosis is poor for 19 patients.</p>
<p>Luo Yiguang, who lived in a certain district of Aiduya Road, failed to be treated repeatedly because he was in the subacute period of gonorrhea. Later, Mr. Luo was referred to Yu by a friend for consultation. Seeing that his swelling of the glans penis had not subsided, the purulent blood discharge from the urethral opening was still dripping out constantly. The urge to urinate was frequent, and there was occasional痉性pain, which made him restless. I washed it first, followed by anti-gonorrhea blood and electricity therapy, and also told to take "Kelinong" internally to reduce inflammation, eliminate bacteria and diuresis. After taking it, the swelling subsided, and it was completely cured in three weeks. Unexpectedly, Mr. Luo had sex with his wife by mistake during gonorrhea, which caused him to be infected, lower abdominal distension, leucorrhea, and local erosion. The body developed a high fever, which was in danger of turning into peritonitis. Then quickly ordered him to purchase "Carle Xue'erdi Vaginal Tablets", and take one tablet every night and put it into the vagina as a suppository to eliminate local inflammation and bacteria. He also took "Kelinong" internally to make the medicine directly act on the bacteria. The gonococci scattered in all parts were removed at once, and the disease turned for the better in less than three weeks, the dangerous symptoms were completely eliminated, and it was completely cured after continuing to use it for one week. Because the husband and wife were cured at the same time, it has never recurred.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: When purchasing "Kelinong", be sure to recognize the three characters "Kelinong" to avoid being deceived!</p>

<h3>"Suicidal Protest" and "Repentance"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>According to reports, two Japanese artillery squad leaders jumped into the railway and committed suicide. Both of these people were young men with a promising future. Why did they take such a desperate measure? At that time, it was widely suspected by the general public. Later, according to secret rumors from the soldiers of the team, the two had received secondary education and were not easily blinded by militarism. They have always insisted on anti-war attitudes and opposed their country's policies toward [China]. The decision to commit suicide probably has the meaning of a "suicidal protest".</p>
<p>The above news does have people feeling strange. It is impossible for us to know whether there are other reasons for these two Japanese soldiers to commit suicide together. If their deaths were truly for the purpose of opposing the war and being dissatisfied with their country's policy toward China, they would be worthy of being considered thoughtful young people. From the point of view of opposing the invasion of our country, they can still be called friends of China.</p>
<p>In our minds, the soldiers of militarist countries seem to be tigers and wolves, constantly baring their teeth and claws, waiting to pounce on people. We have always been accustomed to being trampled by the soldiers of invaders. But the reality is probably not like this. During the Italian-Ethiopian War, Italian soldiers often expressed anti-war sentiments. Now, these two Japanese artillery squad leaders even went so far as to "suicidal protest" (?). This is the best example.</p>
<p>From this fact, we think of the traitors. Since foreign enemies slowly entered our country, a group of people seeking glory and wealth by betraying the country took the opportunity to act, becoming accomplices to the tyrants. These traitors are truly the thieves of the country. Their crimes cannot be pardoned. The meanness of their behavior is truly shameful when compared with these two Japanese soldiers. Didn't Yin Rugeng, the other day, already express repentance? This traitor, since betraying his motherland, organized a puppet government in eastern Hebei, and was at one time extremely prominent. It was recently heard that his relationship with the Su [Soviet] factors and the Kwantung Army was deep, while his relationship with the Japanese Army Department in Tianjin was shallow. Therefore, after Tada took over the responsibility for the Hebei-Chahar negotiations, he became very insecure. So, the other day, he went to the Guandi Temple and prayed for peace for three days, expressing his repentance (?). His plight is such.</p>
<p>These two events give us a lot to think about.</p>
<h3>Sand Grouse</h3>
<p>— Li Yun</p>
<p>When I returned home, I tasted a kind of wild game called sand grouse. I'm not sure if this bird is actually called sand grouse, because the person who gave it as a gift said it was sand grouse, so we call it that too.</p>
<p>The sand grouse looks a lot like a pigeon, with golden-yellow stripes around its eyes, and its body is covered with silver-gray and wooden-yellow mottled feathers. At the end of each feather, there is a black spot in the middle of the gray-yellow, so the black is particularly prominent, like small round beads. This color is certainly not bright, but the elegance is so charming that anyone who sees it finds it lovely. There are two sharp, long feathers on its tail, making it look like a swallow. I often think swallows are too small, like a beautiful woman with an unusually small stature. If it were a sand grouse, so plump, how beautiful it would be flying!</p>
<p>The sand grouse that was sent to our house was already dead. But its round eyes were still staring, and there was blood on its short beak. Its body was already quite stiff.</p>
<p>We never see this bird here. The villagers say that sand grouse are found in the deserts outside the passes and do not reach the mainland. This year the weather is so cold that the land outside the passes is covered with heavy snow, and the sand grouse cannot find food, so they are forced to come in.</p>
<p>Ah, yes, the sand grouse grows north of the Great Wall. It recognizes the yellow sand, the deep grass, the cattle and sheep, the setting sun, and the smoke rising from the Mongolian yurts. It is used to the mournful cries of grazing horses, the distant sound of camel bells, and the wind that blows all year round, day and night. That is the paradise of primitive people.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The sand grouse has no worries. Its short beak and round eyes are so simple and kind! It has hard, long wings to fly and resist the wind; it has thick skin and soft feathers to resist the cold. It knows nothing else and cannot know anything else.</p>
<p>But they had to leave, flying out aimlessly in thousands.</p>
<p>The sand grouse crossed the Great Wall to the south, seeing how much worse it is here than outside the passes. Does the sand grouse find this fertile land better than the desert? But the sand grouse is only prepared to live in the desert. It only has three short toes and thick black skin. It probably never landed in a village. At night, they roost in groups in our southern depressions. Thus, the sand grouse's crisis came.</p>
<p>The villagers do not farm in winter, and they have nothing to do. The young people are bored, and their eyes are particularly sharp. When these birds come, they ask the old people, who say that they must have come from outside the passes; they are sand grouse. The young people are very happy. What is cold? When the sun is about to set, they take nets down to the depressions.</p>
<p>The sand grouse has hard wings, but what is needed when trapped in a net is sharp teeth and claws. Being able to fly is useless. This place, that large depression, is just like the "treasure land" that our ancestors dreamed of, where gold is everywhere. In the desert, the sand grouse only has grass to eat, but here, there is so much sorghum, as red as pearls, scattered on the ground. The sand grouse must have forgotten the desert. The sand grouse does not recognize nets. What is a net? When the sand grouse pecks at the sorghum, its fate is already sealed.</p>
<p>The villagers say that the sand grouse is really stupid; it goes into the net as soon as it touches it. One net can catch twenty or thirty. So, coming from so far away beyond the border, it should be very precious, but the sand grouse is not expensive. Almost every family that likes to eat wild game buys a few to cook in a pot.</p>
<p>The weather is indeed too cold this year. There was no wind today, and it was a little warmer. I went out the back door to take a look. The sand grouse had already been eaten, and their downy feathers were hanging on the withered grass.</p>
<h3>After Seeing "Mei Luo Xiang"</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>China Travel Theater Four Performs at the Carlton</p>
<p>Walking out of the Carlton Theater from the crowd, the cold spring wind blew straight from the racetrack. The gentlemen, with their delicate female companions, got into brand-new cars. I silently thought, "In the audience of 'Mei Luo Xiang', are there people like 'Bai Senqing'? Are there people like 'Ma Ziying'? Furthermore, are there people like 'Mei Luo Xiang'?"</p>
<p>Subconsciously, it seemed that someone was saying in my ear, "Yes!"</p>
<p>Yes, there are. Before this society becomes rational, before the comprador class in the capitalist society is eliminated, when theater is still an amusement for the masters and young masters, there will always be characters like "Bai Senqing" and "Mei Luo Xiang." Even if "Mei Luo Xiang" is not a female actor, she cannot escape the control of the "Bai Senqings"!</p>
<p>However, if Mei Luo Xiang's will were not so weak, if after suffering all kinds of secret sabotage from Bai Senqing, she bravely and frankly told her lover Ma Ziying, who was far away in Xiamen, could Ma Ziying live with her until old age?</p>
<p>Standing in such contemplation, I kept thinking of the good aspects until I got home. In the end, I still feel that if Mei Meng Xiang is willing to close the door and be a virtuous wife and mother, and does not interfere at all with Ma Ziying's "freedom" (that is, freedom regarding entanglements with women), then perhaps they can live together until old age. If Mei Luo Xiang is preparing to be a "person" after marrying, then she will be disappointed.</p>
<p>What Ma Ziying wants from Mei Luo Xiang is not love, but "the true chastity of love."</p>
<p>He does not care about the facts. He only knows that he wants Mei Luo Xiang to guard her chastity of love and wait for him until he makes a fortune to marry her, or to stay with him in poverty.</p>
<p>Can Mei Luo Xiang live contentedly in poverty? The current outcome can be seen. Bai Senqing's assessment is correct. If Mei Luo Xiang returned to Ma Ziying (if Ma Ziying did not know about Mei and Bai's cohabitation), then what would happen later?</p>
<p>If Ma Ziying is still poor, then it may be difficult for the two of them to stay together, but if Ma Ziying becomes rich by opening a mine, after a considerable period of time, this selfish man with a very strong possessive desire will discover Mei Luo Xiang's past shortcomings. He will feel that what Mei Luo Xiang gave him is not a complete and perfect thing. He will be dissatisfied that Mei Meng Xiang once lived with someone. To put it more bluntly, he will be dissatisfied that Mei Luo Xiang's virginity was not dedicated to him. As a result, he will imprison Mei Luo Xiang in her "duty," and he himself will go to other women to seek compensation, because he also has money.</p>
<p>Then, I thought again: as it is now, Bai Senqing and Ma Ziying have both left, what will happen to Mei Meng Xiang? Suicide? Awakening? Or will she be like Xiao Chunlan?</p>
<h3>Tang Huaiqiu Plays Bai Senqing</h3>
<p>— Photographed by Xi Yuqun</p>
<p>As Mei Luo Xiang is now, she will not awaken or commit suicide. All that remains is compromise, either returning to Bai Senqing's embrace or, like Xiao Chunlan, finding another character like Bai Senqing.</p>
<p>In the script and in the performance, what is recognized is these. Ma Ziying's selfish possession is emphasized enough (in fact, Ma is an abominable fellow like Bai Senqing), and Mei Luo Xiang's will seems to be not strong enough. Because of this, our object of hatred often deviates towards Bai Senqing, while we give Ma Ziying a curved understanding. Mei Luo Xiang's weak will also gives us a floating and elusive feeling.</p>
<p>In this performance, the stage setting, lighting, etc., can still be said to be very good, but the "hard piece" in the first act seems a bit too old, so that the wooden frame bones are revealed on the ochre cloth.</p>
<p>The best of the actors is Tang Huaiqiu. Bai Senqing's insidious cunning is deeply expressed by him. However, perhaps because of his too skilled green skills, in a few movements, he is a bit too oily. If he can overcome this shortcoming, it will not be difficult to reach the point of perfection. Dai Ya's Qin Jiao Tian eliminated the problem of pronouncing the words too long here, so he feels particularly lovely. Zhang Manping's Mei Luo Xiang can be said to be competent in general, only in the second act, her transformation is not enough to explain the process of emotional change. Tang Ruoqing's Xiao Chunlan certainly portrays the stereotype of this type of woman in large movements. But if she can pay attention to her voice and give Xiao Chunlan more sculpture in small movements, I think it will definitely be better. Because the outline of a role is of course depicted with large movements, but if this role becomes exquisite, it must be modified with small movements.</p>
<h3>May</h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>May, already in the late spring season. The weather is warm, so warm that it is almost melancholy.</p>
<p>Night, dusk has covered this huge city of Chicago, is the most tranquil, the most peaceful time of day. Noise, shouting, the endless roar of machinery, all are silent at this time, disappeared.</p>
<p>Winckert, a middle-aged worker who has been unemployed for half a year, is walking on one of Chicago's quietest, darkest streets. He had just borrowed money from a relative on Cullen Street. Because of their undeniable friendship, he quickly obtained the three days' worth of bread that he and his family needed from this engineer relative. Although it was only a little bit, Winckert was moved. Although his pace was so firm and heavy, the cheerful face of the old engineer was still vividly floating in his mind.</p>
<p>"He's a great guy!" he muttered to himself, forgetting that he had finished Cullen Street and turned onto another street. This street, he knew well, a famously filthy street, yet everyone in the city of Chicago knew it, because it had famous prostitutes and thieves.</p>
<p>He walked, walking with that firm pace. The cool May breeze gently brushed over his spacious old coat, deeply piercing the pores of his chest, making him feel a little cold. He pulled his coat a little tighter and stepped forward into the quiet street again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he stopped outside a basement bar. Because he heard a burst of rough, cheerful singing, overflowing from the basement that revealed faint light. It very strongly and powerfully sucked him in, making him unable to help but think of the happy life of the past. He had sung this song, it was sung for May; but he had been separated from this song for a full year. In this year, he sank into the calls of life and hunger, for his wife and two young children, he not only did not think of this song, he almost forgot it. Now, this song was buzzing in his ears again, so close, so powerfully sucking him in, almost making him lose his mind. He remembered; it was May!</p>
<p>"Work at eight o'clock!"</p>
<p>The singing gently drifted, full of excitement and heat, flowing in the basement, merging into a chorus of dozens of people.</p>
<p>"Rest at eight o'clock!" (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Tale of the Sad Lovebirds is a sequel to the Hairpin Phoenix incident. Lu Fangweng is also Lu You. Lu You's fiancée, Tang Huixian, followed her father to Sichuan as an official. After her father died, she couldn't bear the abuse of her stepmother. A righteous man risked his life to send her back to the Lu family in Shanyin. You's mother felt pity and arranged an engagement in person. Later, she was glimpsed by a rascal who coveted her beauty. He used a large sum of money to bribe a private nun to intercede with her mother, saying that the girl was destined for a lonely life and was not suitable for marriage. He also secretly instigated astrologers to echo his words to strengthen her belief. The mother, who was a devout Buddhist, fell into his trap without realizing it. She resolutely broke off the engagement and forced You to go far away to take the exam, while forcibly making Huixian a disciple of a lewd nun, causing Huixian to fall into a brothel and almost lose her life. Fortunately, You's friend discovered it and rescued Huixian from danger in the middle of the night, hiding her in Shen's Garden, and personally killing the lewd nun and rascal. The truth was revealed. When You returned unsuccessful, Huixian was already haggard and ill. You's mother asked a friend to visit her and explain the whole story. The mother began to feel remorse and welcomed the girl back, planning to choose an auspicious day for their wedding. However, the girl soon became seriously ill and died before the wedding could take place.</p>

<p>Opening "Hairpin Phoenix"</p>
<p>Love is always infatuation. Ill-fated beauty has been said since ancient times. I, Huixian, lost my parents when I was young and had no one to rely on. I lived in the Lu family. The engagement through cousin was originally a righteous act. The family spent happy days together. What's more, I was happy that my cousin also loved me deeply. We spoke softly to each other. I only hate the nun for being greedy for alms. I only regret that my subtle persuasion caused deep enmity. The broken Hairpin Phoenix, how could it be intentional? It caused extraordinary disasters. The manipulation was nothing but revenge. The most hateful people in the world are nuns. Slander was given to my mother to harm me. I endured thousands of hardships and grievances. My aunt's anger did not subside and her heart changed even more. She made me live alone in the temple and suffer bullying. The evil nun once tempted me to do lowly work. I vowed not to obey in order to protect my chastity. How did my lover know that I was rushing to take the exam? My sad intestines were filled with countless thoughts of who to tell. Although my husband came back and I was lucky enough to see him, I was even more saddened that the lotus flowers could no longer be connected. It's a pity that I can't bear to read the poem of heartbreak. It's a pity that my tears wet my skirt drop by drop. It's a pity that I can't dream after thinking back and forth. It's a pity that I can't sleep all night. It's a pity that I'm afraid to look in the mirror because of my haggard face. It's a pity that I'm seriously ill in bed. It's a pity that I have to continue to tell you about the string. It's a pity that my mother calls me back from the brink of death. I cannot greet and serve her morning and evening. I am willing to stretch my sad eyebrows. I must forgive my daughter-in-law for being unfilial. I sigh that the bad relationship was destined in a previous life. Why blame others for breaking it? I only hope that the heavens know my intentions. The gathering and dispersing of life is like duckweed. I am willing to close my eyes and go to the underworld.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Special Giant Film "Iron Horse"</h3>
<p>Next Release at the Shanghai Grand Theater</p>
<p>In recent years, the Soviet Russian film industry has been actively developing and improving its products, striving to suit the tastes of various countries. Recently, Lin Fei Film Company, a giant in the Soviet Russian film industry, produced a shocking production "Iron Horse". The film uses the Soviet Russian Red Army's most elite and latest invention of amphibious tank detachments as the background, and is accompanied by a quadrilateral love story between the soldiers in the team, which is very interesting. With the latest photography, lively shots, beautiful pictures, and profound implications, it proves that Soviet Russian films are a despised and evil spectacle, and are also a demonstration masterpiece after the Five-Year Plan. Compared with the United States, which is known as the king of movies, it is even better. It is truly the latest powerful and amazing contribution from the Soviet Union. It is heard that the film has been rented by the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road and will be released in the next issue. Viewers who love American films may wish to change their tastes and compare the latest Soviet Russian films with American films. Please pay attention to the opening date!</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: A text about our company on April 30 is inconsistent with the facts. Our company has been open for more than ten years, and has produced more than forty films. This spring, we are reorganizing internally and temporarily suspending filming. After the reorganization is completed next month, all work is in full swing. Therefore, the statement that it is generally suspended like Diantong is completely inaccurate. As for Xia Jun, since he is not Mr. Ren's personal secretary, he left the company last year. I think the rumors are false. I am sending you a special letter requesting a correction, and I will be very grateful. Sincerely, Yueming Film Company</p>
