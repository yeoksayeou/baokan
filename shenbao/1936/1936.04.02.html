<h3>再論華北走私問題</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>華北漏稅走私問題吾人日前有所論列以爲根絕卽不可能最低限度亦當使走私貨物不增加不深入內地但自津海關與北寗路局協緝私貨暫行辦法於三月二十一日實行迄今僅旬日間華北走私之風不特未見稍戢抑且猖獗愈甚浪人武裝護運日憲兵干涉緝私私貨運津較前激增關員束手無策緝私章則等於廢紙是幷吾人最低限度之希望亦不可得共趨勢所至華北津秦等各海口勢將盡成日貨無稅口岸華北經濟幷將陷於萬刦不復地步初不僅我海關行政受其擾亂外債本息之擔保受其影響已也</p>
<p>吾人嘗謂華北走私恐非單純的圖利問題且爲一種有整個計劃的舉動就最近各項事實以觀似益可信三月二十一日新辦法實行之初津日領西田銜總領川樾之命訪北寗路局長陳覺生以緝私新法單獨歧視日貨爲詞提出口頭抗議雖經我方剴切解釋而日方尙未諒解北寗路局由是有所顧忌不能澈底協助緝私近日形勢益非北戴河運私汽船日增至十八九隻以上津西站日憲兵公然干涉緝私三月二十八日秦皇島甚且發生關員被浪人圍毆重傷之怪劇同時冀東僞組織在轄境內各海口徧設稅卡對私貨祇按華北關稅稅率收四分之一浪人卽持此類僞稅卡之稅單强制通過北戴河秦皇島各海口凡此種種舉動顯有軍事政治力量爲其憑藉用意固甚深長也</p>
<p>在今日環境之下欲求華北緝私之有實效已非一紙公文督飭關員路員所能爲力解鈴還是繫鈴人自當先以外交方式覓求解决途徑然吾入窺測日方用意似在借此問題造成困難事實以謀達到更大之目的我當局現雖形格勢禁不能不撇開法理遷就事實但外交亦宜堅持相當限度過此限度則當機立斷實有必要吾則遷延時日徒增糾紛而走私範圍日就擴大將使華北益陷於不可收拾之境矣値茲冀察外交開展聲中此一攸關華北安危之走私問題深望當局有以善處之也</p>

<h3>蘇聯向日警告　蒙邊衝突性質嚴重　事態惡化必致演成日俄戰爭主張成立委會解决邊境糾紛</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）今日俄蒙軍與日僞軍在外蒙邊境之衝突、或將趨於惡化、因蘇俄外交决長施東門那可夫、今日曾向日本駐俄大使提出警告、聲稱此種衝突、必致弄假成眞、爲演俄日眞正之大戰、同時並稱蘇俄現在已有衛護外蒙之義務、雖訴諸武力亦所不惜、故要求日本立卽停至其在邊境上之行動、因蘇俄爲維持和平計、不能坐待事態之變化也、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）外傳外委李維諾夫曾宣稱、日本挑釁舉動、直使和平絕望、此間頃鄭重加以吾認、一般人以爲俄「滿」邊境、一再發生糾紛、雖堪惋惜、但日俄兩國間現行困難、仍望其友好解决、俄日兩國關係、仍望其恢復常態、俄「滿」善隣關係、仍望其有成立之可能、至邊境糾紛所由發生、蘇俄實未負有何項責任、日本政府若凖備成立妥協、蘇俄自必以善意報之云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）三月三十一日蘇聯外交副委員期篤蒙耶科夫、以蘇聯政府對於三月十六日日本政府提議組織委員會以重訂滿洲與蘇聯間邊界東部一段、並組織委員會以解决該段衝突問題之答覆、轉達日本大使太田、</p>
<p>斯氏謂蘇聯政府以爲不僅應在蘇滿邊境興凱湖至圖們江一段獲得和平、且應在蘇滿邊境之全部獲得和平、此乃異常重要、太田大使曾於三月二十七日申明、日本政府爲求建立邊境和平、認爲須及早成立委員會、以解决興凱湖至圖們江一段糾紛、蘇聯政府則以爲殊無理由可以斷定成立委員會以解决蘇滿邊境各段糾紛、行將延遲日　政府所提一段邊境委員會之成立、同時蘇聯政府以爲爲求維持和平、成立邊境委員會以解决蒙滿邊境糾紛、亦屬異常重要、</p>
<p>斯氏申明蘇聯政府攷慮日本政府所言「滿洲國」與外蒙談判、然仍不瞭解日本政府之表示願意與此談判隔離、日本政府旣覺可向蘇聯政府提議於「滿洲國」及蘇聯間成立此種委員會、蘇聯政府以爲日本政府殊無理由可以拒絕蘇聯爲求維持和平、所作帮助於「滿洲國」及外蒙之邊境、成立上述委員會之建議、另一方面、日滿軍不顧外蒙及「滿洲國」間正在進行談判、竟於過去數日屢在蒙滿邊境進攻、因此爲求維持和平、必須採用迅速解决辦法、不能消極等待事態發展、</p>
<p>關於此點、斯氏通知太田、三月二十九日有大批日滿軍隊攻擊離邊界四十五公里阿蒂克都倫之蒙古邊防軍派出所、但因受蒙古軍隊反擊、被迫撤退、三月三十一日日本兵數百人、分乘運貨汽車數十輛、以一砲車及數坦克車裝甲汽車飛機掩護、復向上述邊防軍派出所進攻、繼向達姆西克布拉克方面推進、據談話開始時之最後消息、日滿軍因受蒙古軍隊抵抗、被迫後退、仍在蒙古境內作戰、</p>
<p>斯氏請太田注意此等事件之嚴重性質、並指出必須採用緊急及努力辦法、以立卽終止滿洲境內日「滿」軍對外蒙之攻擊、斯氏同時指出、如日本政府附屬機關之行動、再將現行衝突擴大及加深、則日本政府將負重大責任、</p>
<p>太田允將斯氏意見轉達日本政府、同時反覆申明日本政府並不反對將邊境委員會之職權、擴張至全部蘇滿邊境、但僅希望爲求迅速建立和平起見、主張先從滿蘇間之東部邊境開始、太田繼謂、日本政府同樣亦不反對將其三月十六日之建議、擴張至滿蒙邊境、但日本政府殊難與蘇聯政府談判此項問題、因尙不知蘇聯與外蒙間究有如何關係也、關於蒙滿邊境上之新衝突、太田謂據彼所得消息、所談攻擊乃非日滿方面發動、而由蒙古方面發動、且此衝突乃因邊界不明所致、斯氏指出關於蒙古軍向滿洲領土攻擊消息、全不足信、因吾人殊難相信外蒙能向日本挑戰也、同時關於邊界不明意見亦不能同意、因在三月三十一日日軍企圖衝至達姆西克布拉克、該地乃在外蒙境內、離邊界四十五公里之多、斯氏繼請日本大使注意、蘇聯政府爲求保障自身利益、且爲維持和平及其邊境安全、曾在東京及莫斯科反覆說明對於保持蒙滿邊境和平事伴之意見、</p>
<p>斯氏繼謂在二月二十一日彼曾通知太田、外蒙如受第三者攻擊、蘇聯所負援助責任、此種責任在一九二一年蘇聯及蒙古政府爲共同抵抗敵人攻擊協定互相援助時起、卽已存在、此種口頭責任、已於今年三月十三日在庫倫簽訂之互助草的中正式定、（一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>蒙偽軍又衝突</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）三月三十一日、日滿軍一隊、分乘運貨汽車數十輛、在坦克車裝甲車及飛機掩護之下、又向阿蒂克都倫之蒙古邊防兵派出所進攻、佔領該地、復向達姆西克布拉克前進、日滿軍已迫近蒙古境內、離邊界四十五公里之達姆西克、但蒙古軍隊獲得援軍、努力抵抗、迫令日滿軍退出阿蒂克都倫、日滿軍於增援後又復進攻、據聞目下尙在蒙古邊境肉搏、（一日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（長春）關東軍司令部發表謂、日滿軍巡羅隊於二十九日下午一時許、被外蒙軍用機轟炸、日方卽派一部隊前往現地、調查眞相、然三十一日下午一時半、又與日前同一地點（卽大烏倫西北方二十啟羅滿境內）遭遇外蒙軍用機十二架轟炸、交戰的達半小時、復於是日下午三時、與外蒙鐵甲部隊相過交戰、兩方均死傷人、（一日同盟電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄與外蒙　所訂互援公約關係時局重大</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄業與外蒙古訂立互助公的、此於遠東局勢、蘇俄一般政策、甚至國際局勢、均將發生影響、自屬無疑、莫斯科對於庫倫、原本在技術上加以援助、俾克抵抗日本與「滿洲國」之壓迫、而保護領土、自互助公的成立之後、此項技術援助、已有正式性質得以增加力量、而在各項問題之中、任何形式之下、盡量行之、惟是公的之名、雖日互助、實際上乃係蘇俄援助外蒙古、蘇俄現與外蒙古接壤、又復單獨承認外蒙古政府、而在庫倫設置外交代表、其在外蒙古經濟上、尤其是外交上、已享有優越之勢力、茲益以互助公的、則外蒙古向爲蘇俄之天然屏蔽者、蘇俄自能進一步而樹立眞正之保護制、並夷外蒙古爲附庸矣、雖然、外蒙古仍屬中國領土完整之一部、前此宜佈獨立、旣未爲中國所承認、而中國對於類似事件、卽「滿洲國」宣佈獨立、並與日本成立日「滿」議定書之所爲、亦曾以國聯會盟的爲根據、而向國聯會提出抗議、今茲對於俄蒙互助公的，自必表示異議、至以國際局勢而論、數年以來、蘇俄對於日本向外發展政策、原以延宕爲得計、此際乃與外蒙古成立互助公的、其迎頭加以對付之决心、自可槪見、蘇俄殆自信實力充足、足以應付一切事變、外蒙古雖與莫斯科相距十二日之遙、其境內雖未建築鐵道、但蘇俄仍願接受範圍廣大之的束、而無所懼、德國對於蘇俄、曁與蘇俄締有互助公約各國、雖加以帝國主義的威脅、不難分散蘇俄力量、蘇俄亦非所懼明矣、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>何成濬談　巡視鄂北感想</h3>
<p>民情風俗視前改變爲國家計亟應救濟</p>
<p>漢口通信，駐鄂綏靖主任何成濬，此次巡視鄂北歸來，發表　面談話如下，</p>
<p>「此次巡視鄂北，目擊民間情况，却有不少感想，本人祖居鄂北，深知鄂北一帶，民風樸厚，地方出產，亦尙富庶，此次經過所見，則一切大不如前、一則人民習於懶惰、二是人民思想改變、從前鄉間農民、於農事之暇、總歷營一種副業、男子探樵、女子紡織、終歲勞作、不肯休息、現在鄉間人民、不但不經營副業、並正業亦都隨便數衍、此决經過地方、頗多荒蕪，問其原因、都謂無人耕種、如果是在災區匪區地方、猶有可說、至於安全地帶、人民亦懶於種田、此眞絕大危機、去年鄂北發生一决大水、生產更是銳减、近一兩月內、因爲靑黃不接、一般無知識人民、以困於生計、往往爲潛伏之匪類煽誘、流而爲匪者、所在多有、其子弟習於邪僻、雖爲父兄者、亦不能制止、其在宗族鄕黨間較爲明白事理者、多不願開罪此輩、防其報復、而不肖者、則以類聚、相繼作惡、民情風俗、竟至如此、却又是一種絕大危機、日前經過隨縣時、見一被捕之匪、神色自若、對觀衆謂「我是到縣署去受訓的、不要一兩月就可回來」、看來不以當匪爲辱、人心至此、殊覺可懼、古人謂十室之邑、必有忠信、現在忠信之士、不是避匿不出、便已遷往都市、本署前曾組織宣撫委員會、催促各縣公正士紳回里、但各士紳大都去而復返、致令鄕村無一重心人物、出而主持、人民思想之丕變、此亦是一大原因、鄂北各縣保甲、形式上固足可觀、實質上是吾臻於健全、尙難遽加斷語、所謂聯保主任保甲長等、公正之士、多不肯幹、因爲如此、所以民情兪懶惰、人心亦愈變壞、有人以爲農村破產、須由國家投法救濟、然由國家救濟現在一般農村、不但中國政府無此財力，恐任何國政府亦無此財力，且政府散欵可救濟者，只能達到狡猾奸民，鄉愚恐未能盡沾其惠，孔子說因民之所利而利之，民有荒田荒山，應黃令其種植，勿使利棄於地，管子有言、倉　實而後知禮節、衣食足而後知榮辱、倉廩必如何而後實、衣食必如何而後足、惟有督率人民習於動儉、人民如都能習於動儉、則無曠土、無游民、衣食自足、愈糜自實、人民自然知禮節榮辱、習俗自返於淳樸、此等情形、雖係鄂北一隅、却亦關於全國」、（三月三十日）</p>

<h3>日方要求　派軍防共經過　竟藉口維持東亞和平　未答以毋勞越爼代謀　目前局勢已轉趨和緩</h3>
<p>北平通信、在一週以前、山西剿匪軍事緊張之際、冀察外交、頗多謠傳、經過情形、迄至最近、始得公開傳播、此間當局、頃正在津、謀以最善之努力、消弭隱患、未來推演、或可少容時日也、</p>
<p>日人對山西共禍之感覺、特殊興奮、就一般日人對山西共禍之感覺、特殊興奮、就一般日人之談吐論、槪分兩派、一派屬於外交界人員、最近赴晋境視察者、頗不乏人、歸來後、咸認山西剿匪軍事、極為激烈、惟深以短期內不易肅淸為憂、另一派則為軍籍中人、論調幾出一轍、均以彼邦人士所辦之通信消息為根據、極盡張大其辭之通融、甚且藉口上海出版之某法文報紙所載之訊、對我當局、作惡意批評、</p>
<p>所謂批評、卽誣指巾國政府「聯俄」「容共」、並宣稱彼邦為維持所謂「東亞和平」、保障所謂「華北利源」起見、願以實力帮助冀察當局、從事防共工作、必要時、且可聘任剿擊之責、職是之故、此間一週以前、卽有日本將有大批軍隊開駐天津通州之傳說、同時、天津亦傳稱日軍部已在津租定房屋、為增駐部隊居住之用、風聲鶴唳、人心顯呈不安、</p>
<p>是時冀察政委會委員長宋哲元、正在保定考詢縣長、並　理冀省　　　、自接得日方準備增兵情報後、卽　　召北平市長秦德純、赴保面商應付辦法、　　與天津市長蕭振　、同赴天津、就候晤日本駐華大使有田之便、與駐津日軍重要幕僚、有所說明、　　並正式代　宋哲元表示、冀察兩省與平津兩市之防共措置、極為縝密、冀察與山西交界處之防共布置、足可應付、毋勞日方越爼代謀、結果、尚稱圓滿、日軍增兵說、因是似趨平息、</p>
<p>惟北平日大使館武官今井武夫、前（二十九）日於宋哲元未赴天津以前、曾一度謁宋、有所詢問、談話內容、據日是人報紙京津日日新聞所載、含義頗深、因屬交換意見性質、故並無具體討論等語、宋頃正在津與新任駐津日軍部附松室孝良·及司令官多田駿、作通當酬酢、就便將以私人資格交換意見、北平市長秦德純·曁政會委員石敬亭·政務處長潘毓桂等、昨（三十）亦先後奉召赴津、　贊一切、截至現在止、冀察外交、嚴重局面、雖轉和緩、但前途非易樂觀、蓋日方之藉口、往往遠非理想所可及、據外交界中人表示、新任天津日軍部附之松室孝良、在國民軍時代、曾任馮玉祥氏之顧問、與宋哲元曁前國民軍主幹人員、頗多熟稔、松室此次來華負天津日軍駐平辦理交涉之責、雙方認識旣較一般為深、故均屬望未來一切、在平等原則之下、較已往有良好進步、茲聞松室已定四月六日由津來平、正式辦公、機關名稱、為天津日軍駐平代表辦公處、內容分設四課、正由各主管人員負責籌備、日內卽可就緖、（三月三十日）</p>
<h3>汪案公開審訉記（二）　第一日宜審訉張賀劉三犯　供認謀刺不諱但仍狡賴</h3>
<p>本來主張用炸彈</p>
<p>審判長再謂、你在中央醫院時、檢察官曾問過你、你說暗殺本不是你的目的、你本來主張用炸彈、警戒他們、（指蔣汪等中樞當局）陳銘樞李濟琛想爭政治地盤、認為一定要刺殺蔣委員長汪院長、才能達到他們的目的、所以才叫你們組織晨光社、何以此刻又加否認、張怨對此、則謂此誠失之毫釐、差以千里矣、審判長駁之、謂此有紀錄可憑、而且此項紀錄、曾經你看過簽字的、何能推諉、張犯仍狡賴、謂確未說明過此話、也許看紀錄時、神志未淸、未曾注意、審判長再駁之、謂你的自白書中、對此亦曾詳述、且以白自書提示、張犯則謂此自白書不可　、請庭上注意其他兩自白書、審判長對張犯之不誠實、予以吿誡後、繼續審訉、</p>
<p>余立奎曾刺宋氏</p>
<p>余立奎是何人、　王亞樵的朋友、　你曾供過、余立奎是刺宋子文案中重要分子、是嗎、　他與本案無關、　王亞樵部下任暗殺工作的有幾人、　不知道、　胡大海·周希平·張志韓·你認識嗎、　不認識、　你前後所供不同、你在警察廳裹對余立奎的事情、供得很詳、你記得嗎、　記不得、至此、審判長又提示筆錄、張均予以否認、　你見過余立奎嗎、　見過一面、他曾任十九路軍團長、是否刺宋、　實不知、　你們要刺蔣委員長汪院長、究竟是為什麼、是共產黨呢、還是受陳李指使、還是另有主義、　這事是孫鳳鳴做的、因為他對蔣委員長汪院長不滿意、</p>
<p>一度加入共產黨</p>
<p>你以前加入過共產黨的、是嗎、　二十年加入過後、因多看書、在二十三年脫離了、　民族革命大同盟是什麼意思、　我在自白書中所寫的、不過是道聽塗說而已、　照你說來、你對本案是一點關係也沒有了、　那倒不是、　那末、你自己說、你究竟有什麼關係、　我在晨光社帮過忙、如我保搬房子寫鋼板等、孫鳳鳴行刺、我是知道的、而且也同情、這個我不否認、此外就無其他關係了、　孫鳳鳴是那一方面的人、你幾時認識他的、　他是王亞樵的人、我認識他二三年了、是王介紹來的、他來的時候、有時是單獨來的、有時是華克之陪來的、　你最近一次離開南京、是什麼時候、　在六中全會閉幕前幾天、　十月廿八日、你們開秘密會、你們鼓勵孫鳳鳴、你說些什麼話、　這並不是開會、不過是大家一起隨便談談而已、談話時、今天的被吿中、除廬慶麟外、其餘都在塲、</p>
<p>談話時孫要行刺</p>
<p>你們談話的目的、就是商議行刺、是不是、　談話並無目標、不過孫鳳鳴表示要去行刺、大家都贊成、我當時說此事有相當意義、　行刺的目標是誰、　第一是蔣委員長、其次是汪院長、如達不到目的、那末、就隨便放幾槍警吿、這是孫鳳鳴的主張、並不是我主動、因為假如孫鳳鳴不願意行刺、而由我叫他去、才能算由我主張、但事實並非如此、　你曾供過行刺的主使人是陳銘樞·李淸琛·王亞樵·華克之等、主謀是華克之·張玉華·賀坡光等、知情是劉書容·項仲霖·李懷誠·廬慶麒等、何以現在又不承認、　具體的事實在祇是我剛才所說的幾句話、　手槍是那裏來的、　找不知道、我祗在社裏看見過、是放在小箱子裏的、這時是六中全會前四五天、　這枝手槍第二次是不是放廬慶麟家裏、　我不知道、　你說過手槍祇育對付一兩個人、你主張用炸彈、是不是、　我沒有這樣講過、</p>
<p>因孫行刺先離京</p>
<p>你是何時離京的、　六中全會前一兩天的夜裏、　是不是因為孫鳳鳴要行刺、所以先走開、　是的、　孫鳳鳴在中央黨部、是那個送去的、　賀光坡、　你們　謀行刺、一共幾次、　三次、第一次是五中全會、目標對蔣委員長、第二次是汪院長辭職、蔣委員長返京時、目標仍是對蔣委員長、第三就是本案發生時、三次都是由孫鳳鳴担任、　以前兩次為什麼失敗、　第一次失敗、據孫鳳鳴說、看見蔣委員時、神經大緊張、等到想動手、蔣委員長已上車去了、第二次因為沒有看見蔣委員長、這兩次我都知道、　第二次失敗後、你們找過郭衛忠、（註音）是你去找的、是嗎、　我本來想到江西德安、找莫雄謀事、適巧王亞樵來信、叫我把郭衛忠·孫鳳鳴·帶到香港去、所以我順便去找他來、我帶他們到香港後、因為孫鳳鳴吿奮勇、一定要行刺、所以沒有換郭衛忠、　你們行刺的主使人究竟是誰、　開始是王亞樵、王代表誰、我不知道、祗曉得王的經濟是由陳銘樞·李濟琛·接濟的、至是否是陳李主使、我不知道、</p>
<p>行刺時通信方法</p>
<p>你們行刺時、用招租條子表示已否動手、第一次是由郭智案峯、（註音）第二次是由廬慶麒担任的、是不是、　我記不淸楚了、　孫鳳鳴到中央黨部去、本來要由你送去的、何以又改出賀坡光送去呢、　因為賀佳在鎭江、逃走使當、並且他對中央黨部熟悉些、　你什麼時候認識賀坡光、他在晨光社担任什麼事、　三年前在上海認識他、担任採訪、他未參加本案、但是他亦預謀、　談話會時、他對孫鳳鳴說些什麼話、　同我所說的差不多、</p>
<p>供述與各犯關係</p>
<p>至此、張犯對審判長所訊各節、繼續供稱、謂賀沒有到過香港、賀的未婚妻叫黃文桂、（註音）孫鳳鳴的妻子叫崔景瑤、（註音）姨妹叫崔景琦、（註音）均知此事、劉書容是我的同鄉、會時、他沒有表示意見、李懷誠與我認識、但在社裏無事、僅常常來玩、對此事也是知道的、以談話會中說的話、記不淸了、項仲霖是我的朋友、他住在社內、但無職務、談話會他也在埸、講的話、記不淸楚了、他與華克之很好、是華叫他來的、他有不有託人　項、領取中央黨部出入證、不知道、廬慶麒是認識的、他在社裏沒有職務、對行刺事、也是知道的、開會時、他不在場、手槍是那兒帶來放在他家的、我不知道、出事前我到他家去過、給他五十塊錢、不過是借給他用、並沒有給他做逃避的旅費的意思、</p>
<p>否認本案之要犯</p>
<p>我沒有到福建去過、我與華克之是好友、這是事實、與本案關、也是事實、但不能說是有最重要的關係、我加入共黨社聯、担任區委、以為那是一個研究社會科學的機關、加入時、沒有憑證、退出時、也沒有憑證、賀坡光有沒有加入過共產黨　聯工聯、我不知道、此次行刺的原因、是對蔣委員長汪院長不滿意、這也許是我對政治認識不淸楚的緣故、但是此事百分之九十九是孫鳳鳴主動的、事發後、香港帶來八百六十元、是華克之交崔景瑤帶來的、至此、審判長以審訊已畢、雖張犯對一二重要處予以否認、但案情業已大白、乃傳訉賀坡光、時為四時十五分、</p>
<p>賀犯更為狡狤百般推卸責任</p>
<p>審判長對賀犯、亦先予以忠吿、囑供述務須忠實、但賀犯較張犯更為狡狤、百般推掉責任、但事實眞相、極為明顯、亦可謂徒勞無益、審判長與賀犯問答、大要如次、</p>
<p>你與張玉華是什麼時候認識的、　二十三年之後、　與劉書容是那裏認識的、　在南京南洋旅館、　與李懷誠是怎麼認識的、　一十三年三月在上海山謝更生（註音）介紹認識的、　王亞樵華克之你認識嗎、　王沒有見過、華是二十三年九月有在張玉華那裏認識的、　你知不知道晨光社的背景、　最初以為是一個純粹的新聞機關、張推　我做記者、開辦後一星期、張玉華同我談起華克之的好友孫鳳鳴的蓄意、我才知道、當第一次實行前、我在中央醫院生病、張玉華劉書容來看我、張方吿訴我孫要行刺、　你寫過自白書你記得嗎、　不全部記得、審判長乃將自白書提示、賀承認為共所寫、但寫時是因為內心反省的結果、　你們行刺、是想搗亂治安是嗎　裏我沒有要搗亂中央的用心、是張玉華同我談了以後才知道要行刺、　照你說來、你對要簡直一點都不知道了、　我沒有參加計劃、祗是張玉華吿訴我要行刺蔣委員長、　晨光社的經濟來源、你知道嗎、　據張玉華吿訴我、是華克之活動來的、我問過他、華從那裏得來、他說華同陳銘匾李濟琛關係很好、所以由陳李供給的、　先後得到多少、　我不知道、　晨光社負責人是誰、　我是採訪、是張叫我去的、出名的是胡雲卿、就是華克之、　華克之為什麼要化名、　我到發稿後才知道他化名、我問化名的用意、他吿訴我他不滿意當局、要向他們要求、　怎麼要求呢、　我不知道、</p>
<p>行刺初對蔣委員</p>
<p>至此、審判長以其太形狡黠、予以訓斥、賀始稱我出醫院後、才知道孫已在社有行刺的意思、第一次計劃對蔣委員長、第二次也是對蔣委員長、第三次他們吿訴我、如蔣委員長刺不到、就刺汪院長、　十月二十八日你們開談話會、談些什麼、　這並非談話會、不過是飯後閒談、華克之說希望孫鳳鳴去行刺、孫也很憤慨表示決心去幹、我祗說此事很有意義、並沒有鼓勵、</p>
<p>出入證是賀領的</p>
<p>十月三十號去領出入證的嗎、　是的、因為項仲霖沒有領得到、　孫鳳鳴是你送到中央黨部去的嗎、　我沒有送進去、我祗領了證章交給他、　這枝手槍你看見過嗎、　在憲兵司令部看見過的、　在晨光社沒有看見嗎、　也看見過來的、來處不知道　你以前供過說開會是指派各人工作、你又供過說華克之對你們說行刺對象、第一是蔣委員長、第二是汪院長、原因是陳銘樞李濟琛因為閩變失收、所以叫華克之組織晨光社、他們要刺政府要人、使政治上發生大騷動、可以恢復政治地位、你又供過陳李利用你們、你們也利用陳李、使援助紅軍、解除目前的困難、是不是、　我沒有說過、</p>
<p>竟然否認供詞簿</p>
<p>審判長乃提示其詞簿是紅綫條的、這本藍綫條不對、審判駁之、謂紅綫條的是高五分院、藍綫條的是首都地方法院的、現在所問的是根據地方法院的、賀仍謂地方法院的也是紅綫條的、審判長以供詞簿中賀曾簽名、如此狡賴、殊屬非是、乃予以訓斥、關於送孫鳳鳴至中央黨部一節、賀犯對審判長之訉問供稱、出事那天、到中央黨部去兩次、第一次太早、未領到出入證、第二次約八點二十五分領到出入證、到民生旅館隔壁茶館交給孫鳳鳴後、就到和平門乘火車去了、</p>
<p>怕檢査逃往鎭江</p>
<p>審判長至此又問、你曾經供過你乘火車本想到上海、因為恐怕檢査、所以先到鎭江、你為什麼要害怕、如果這事與你無關、你怕檢査幹什麼呢、賀犯對此無可推諉、你乃答稱我知此事、但仍否認係參與此事、旋又答供稱二十三年四月加入共黨敎聯、未任工作、以為是一讀書會、不知是共黨機關、二十三年二月初去過香港本來是友人謝鳳聲（註音）介紹到十九路軍工作、但到了福建、十九路軍已失敗、所以到香港轉回上海、項仲霖是到福建遇到的、劉書容原來認識的、在晨光社與我一樣地位、李懷誠在社無職務、項仲霖是二十四年四五月間由張玉華叫來、向政府機關活動津貼的、開會時、我未鼓勵我未叫孫鳳鳴去殺人、但我同意他、所以沒有舉發、我在社內吃飯、共用過多少錢、沒有統計、</p>
<p>刺宋案稱不知情</p>
<p>宋子文在滬被刺事、我不知道、王亞樵余立奎也不認識、手槍藏在什麼地方也不知道、謀刺蔣委員長共三次、失敗的原因、我不知道、秘密通訊方法、是我上了車張玉華才吿訴我的、我要到上海去的原因、因為知道事情發生的緣故、我逃到鎭江後、因為風聲緊、所以由嫂嫂陪我到鄉下去、事發後、香港寄錢來的事、我不知道、我走的時候、張玉華給我六十塊錢、廬慶麟家以前去過兩次云云、至此、審判長乃傳訊劉書容、時為五時二十五分、</p>
<p>劉書容較直率　秘密會未發言</p>
<p>劉犯供詞、較張賀兩犯為直率的、大致謂與張玉華是幼年同學、到南京來是張叫我來玩玩的、在晨光社採訪、以發稿後一星期、張玉華吿訴我組織晨光社的用意、說孫鳳鳴要刺蔣委員長、當時孫不在社、我未表示意見、審判長乃問、你旣知他要刺蔣委員長、不要說蔣委員長是我國領袖、就是殺一個普通的人、也是犯罪的、你旣知情而不吿發、是何居心、劉犯供稱、因張玉華把這秘密消息吿訴了我、我走不了、並且我在黨部的事、也辭去了、他們的計劃、是事後才吿訴我的、至於行刺的目的、他們不肯吿訴我、他們每次舉動、總是給錢、叫我先到上海去、我所知道的行刺祗有兩次、第一次是五中全會、第二次就是本案發生的時候、孫鳳鳴是華克之帶來的、十月二十八日開會、我始終沒有發言、因為我平時對國事、沒有意見、行刺背後主使人、我不淸楚、我知道這件事情、並且贊成、但行刺是孫的行動、我在三十日已經到上海去了、手槍是華克之由上海帶來的、放在晨光社的箱子裏、我看見的、郭智峯曾經放過一槍試試、項仲霜住在社裏、是請他活動經費、李懷誠常常到社裹來玩、我在社裏共用一百多元、張玉華·賀坡光·同我的意見是一致的云云、時已五時五十分、審判長諭吿、本日不及審訊完結、定明（三十一）日下午一時繼續開審、本日筆錄俟整理後明日宣讀、乃諭被吿還押退庭、（中央社）</p>

<h3>在海南島　北安觸礁沉沒　本埠北方公司所有　保平安險十六萬元</h3>
<p>本埠法租界公館馬路之北方航業公司、所有北安號輪、在海南島外遇險、船已浸水、且難救護、全輪船員員尚未脫險、公司十分憂慮、茲將詳情分述、</p>
<p>租與日商</p>
<p>北方航業公司之北安輪、在全部商輪中爲最大之一艘、此船新購自英商、約四年、原名Taccola、船身長三百二十六英尺、闊四十五英尺、吃水二十一英尺八寸、載重五千三百餘噸、註册爲三千八百八十噸、改名北安號、此輪原行滬津班、近因日商三井租用、即由經方公司賃與日商、改航洪基香港及日本各埠、</p>
<p>失事原由</p>
<p>據北方航業公司中負責人員對記者言、北安輪今回自洪基運煤到東、一切船舶管理、悉由賃租之日人負責、星期二上午七時許、北安輪開至海南島之巴克峽海面、（在東京灣外）先遇旋風蒙霧、該處暗礁叢立、航行最險、上次通順輪觸礁沉沒、亦在該處附近、北安船主（日本人）誤行航道、觸入礁石、立即洞破、海水沖進、危險立現、乃發無綫電求援、當時並無船舶開往、此失事之大概也、</p>
<p>艦輪已到</p>
<p>滬公司未得該輪直接發來電報、僅得日商轉到電通社之新聞電、除滬行轉電天津總行外、並發電到汕頭分經理處、請爲就近探詢、至午後得電訊、香港方面已有兩船開往、一名海平、一爲外艦、因此處本爲海盜淵藪、恐發生危險、故軍艦到來保衛、</p>
<p>營救船員</p>
<p>北安輪中共有船員六十餘名、除船主大副外、餘均爲華人、至今船體猶在海面、尚未全沒、船員悉在輪內、海平輪正謀援救中、然恐無救出希望、查此船船壳、在本埠揚子公司保平安險十六萬元、連同船內貨物等之損失及船員物件等、約在三十萬元之譜、</p>

<p>悼亡自殺</p>
<p>是日下午七時、船至鎮江高資間十二圩地方江面、曾文二人、感覺艙內沉悶、同行出艙、至台甲上隨行隨言、兩述及家庭前事、曾以家破妻亡、激刺太深、神經頓起變態、及同至三層台甲船邊、乘文在轉身之際、曾趁其不備、一躍入江、從三層台甲跳下、文知有異、急欲往拖、無如曾穿軍服、未及拉住、而已直墜江心自殺矣、此際文已呆若木鷄、不言不語、痴立而望、以致曾氏自殺投江、船上竟無一人得知、</p>
<p>妻弟慟哭</p>
<p>文於曾氏投江後、並未報告、逕返五十五號艙內、對一等兵金志義述後、文思念戚誼、在艙痛哭、爲船上茶房所聞、比及進艙往詢、始知曾已投江自殺、顧此時已距落水時約半小時許矣、急由茶房飛報船主、無如船將到鎮江、距十二圩已有十三海浬之遙、即使回航亦難撈救、故曾之尸體、迄未撈獲、</p>

<p>江北人陳慶生·瞿海記·王道清·等、因有嚇詐福新面粉廠經理無錫人王堯臣之嫌疑、被王於昨報告新閘捕房、派探員葉玉山·印占卿·往將陳·瞿·王·三人拘入捕房收押、昨晨、依照刑法三四六條第一三兩欵恐嚇詐財罪、解送第一特院刑八庭、提起公訴、即據捕房律師張天蔭起而陳述案情、謂福新面粉廠第三廠、於去歲三月間、因欲在廠門首</p>
<p>開闢河道、乃由經理王堯臣招被告陳慶生承包開河工程、詎工作祇有半月、忽由市政府公用局繼續接辦、致陳之工作、即爲廠方停止、但陳自停工後、對於帳目、雖已結清、惟竟藉口受有相當損失、屢次向廠方滋擾、去年七月二十三日、陳即向王堯臣要挾借欵、</p>
<p>聲勢洶洶、後由王着帳房李雨新代付洋五十元、迨至本年一月十五號、有福新廠協理張振林乘包車經過西蘇州路大通路口、被告陳慶生即上前將包車攔住、用強暴手段、索詐四十元、如不給須將張殺死、當時張無法抵抗、祇得如數付給、現張振林查於兩星期前病故、其包車夫江阿福今已到案、可以證明、又查陳曾於本年二月十號向成都路兆慶里十七號門牌福新廠協理</p>

<p>達十萬元　之多、內中言詞恫嚇、有以炸彈炸燬王之本身及汽車字樣、故捕房深恐該項恐嚇信與被告陳慶生有關、乃將陳之字跡送交工部局騐字處騐明、與恐嚇信上筆跡不同、或係陳托人代書、惟此點捕房並未起訴云云、又據王堯臣偕證劉金奎·王世華·江阿福·何仁榮·等相繼投案、證明陳慶生屢次到來強借欵項情形、詰之陳慶生供稱、我向王堯臣</p>
<p>承攬開河　工程、計四千方、並有承攬據及保單、不料開工半月、即遭廠方停工、致受損頗巨、屢次向王交涉無效、並無強索欵項情事、質之瞿·王·二人、供亦推諉、吳則韓推事核供、以本案尚有調查之必要、乃諭改期再訊、並着王堯臣下次將承攬據帶案候查、</p>

<h3>上海之呢絨業　（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業槪况之二十）</p>
<p>二，呢羢之來源及其市價</p>
<p>呢絨大半來自海外，前已言之，若按國別言之，以英國出品爲最多，品質亦最優良，德意法等國次之。波蘭呢絨，花樣合時，年來頗極一時之盛。日貨呢絨（如花呢嗶嘰等），自去年公開販賣以來，以其售價特廉，行銷頗廣，英貨與國貨皆受其壓迫。國貨之產額本極有限，僅章華仁立等數廠之出品而已，此外尙有中美合辦之海京伯呢絨廠之出貨，惟皆因成本過高，尙未盛銷。</p>
<p>至呢絨市况，就去年一年而論，頗多變化，按十一月以前，皆在續跌之中。十一月以後，因新貨幣政策實行，外滙降低，洋貨成本的增百分之二三十，經同業公議，漲價百分之十，始告復蘇，今擇常川之嗶嘰花呢數種，去年全年市價，列表比較於後：</p>
<p>註：以上兩表，以每碼計價，價格單位爲元。</p>
<p>按我國城市居民，衣着呢絨者頗多，當此高喊國貨救國之際，自宜從速推進民族呢絨製造業，此吾人所應注意者也。（未完）</p>

<p>我們到柳州、會赴市街觀察、並詢問柳州縣長、楊君以商業情形、據云、近來以受不景氣之影響、商業比較稍爲减色、市上銷路、以國貨爲大宗、但間有商人貪圖小利、販賣外國貨、不過市價稍高、不甚合算、故不足懼、所懼者某國貨用私運及利用小輸夾帶進口、防不勝防、蓋旣不完稅、當然價格低廉、人人貪了便宜、不免趨之若騖、現梧州餉捐局及出入口貿易處、特別注意、一方民衆受了敎育、愛國之心、日見濃厚、此後或可避免、此則有待於地方熱心士女之努力提倡耳、</p>
<p>繼至桂林考察、雖屬文化之區、風景秀麗甲天下、但人口稀少、商業亦見凋敝、市上貨品、均由廣州香港從梧州輸入、國貨雖甚發達、但外國貨亦難絕跡、其原因亦以偷稅私帶爲多、與桂林商會諸委員談、均願上海國貨多多輸入、使人民衣食住行上、均不必仰給舶來品商會歡迎席上、許多委員並希望上海國貨工廠、至內地設分廠以期减輕稅則運費、則貨品成本、亦可减低、並言省中甚願組織服用國貨團、爲內地倡、默察桂省人士樸實耐勞、節儉刻苦、與外國貨自易絕緣、惟有許多用品、用慣舶來貨、而不知國產早有供給、此則滬上國貨工廠宣傳未力所致、故以後應多多派人往內地接洽、廣發樣品、俾內地人羣知國貨之可用、自然樂於購買、而舶來之品、不抵制而自抵制矣、</p>

<p>學校調查</p>
<h3>上海法國學校概況（三）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>該校校長之下設副校長一人，襄助校長處理校中訓育事項。副校長係由學校中服務最久之敎師遞升，平時亦須擔任一半功課；遇校長缺席時代理一切校務，校中敎師完全擔任敎課，不兼任何職務。另有訓育員二人不兼課，在下課時負責監護學生安全；平時則處理關於學生較小的訓育事項。遇有重大事項則須請示或移交校長或副校長辦理。全校敎職員每月有時舉行會議一次，討論敎學上的問題或交換研究的心得。</p>
<p>經費收支情形　該校本年度預算爲十九萬四千五百餘元；學費收入約三萬九千元，是以法公董局本年度實際撥出約十五萬五千五百餘元。在全部預算中，全校敎職員薪金與校役工資約佔十八萬六千餘元，佔全部支出百分之九十一以上；這是因爲敎職員係專仟職，少有更動，因此薪金逐年增高，而各項設備因逐年已有增加，每年需要添置數量倒反減少。本年度其他各項辦公用費及添置等費約八千一百餘元。學生所繳學費各級數額不等，每月自五元至二十五元，月終由家長或保護人來校繳付。該校本學期有學生四百三十人，假定全年有學生八百六十人；法公董局每年撥付該校約十八萬五千五百餘元；以八百六十人平分，則局方每年對於每生所耗之敎育費平均約一百八十元。又每年學生共付學費約三萬九千元，以四百三十人平分，則每個家長爲其每個入學兒童每年負擔學費約計九十元。</p>
<p>嚴密的訓練</p>
<p>法國學校是主張嚴密訓練的。法國的敎育家對於兒童官理和訓練自身的能力很少信任；因此他們認爲敎師和訓育員必須直接地訓練學生。他們主張嚴密的訓練有四種理由：</p>
<p>法國的兒童有一種崇向個性自由和平等待遇的趨向，因此敎育者必須訓練他們接受法定的規章。</p>
<p>服從既然是社會訓練成人的第一個原則，那麼，二歲至二十歲的公民必須多有機會學習服從的訓練。</p>
<p>學校中需要學生所做的工作份量只能在嚴密的分工監督之下完成，因此不能信告學生能自動地訓練自己。</p>
<p>學校校長既然對於學生全部的行爲和健康負責，他當然應該將訓練的工作負責地實施起來。</p>
<p>此種嚴密訓練的組織可分通學學校和寄宿學校兩方面來說：</p>
<p>通學學校　在上課時學生的一切行爲完全由敎師負責訓導。在遊息時，訓育員負責監護學生的安全和監督學生的行爲，處罰的方法包括記過，留置校中，停學，除名等。體罰則由政府禁止不用。</p>
<p>寄宿學校　在寄宿學校中，學生的行爲更是受着學校嚴密的監督。除開假日與星期四下午星期日之外，學生是終年地住在學校圍墻之內，不能私出校門一步。學生在校中無論何時均有訓育員嚴密地監督着：他們讀書時有敎師監督；吃飯時，遊息時和就寢時都有訓育員監督。</p>
<p>星期四下午，學生可得郊外遠足；但是仍舊沒有自由活動的機會。他們必須排着隊散步；就是在做球類運動時，也有訓育員隨同監督。星期日學生的家長可領學生回家一次。</p>

<h3>蘇武牧羊</h3>
<p>— 杜箴宇</p>
<p>古代我國的北邊，有一個極大的敵人，那便是匃奴。在股周的時候（民國紀元前二三〇〇年至三七〇〇七〇〇年之間），它不斷的到中國邊境上來騷擾；到了戰國秦漢之際（民國紀元前二一〇〇至二三〇〇年之間）它的勢力更是一天比一天的擴張起來—除了它原有的根據地現在的蒙古）以外；差不多東胡（現在東北的北部）和西域諸國（現在的靑海新疆），都在它勢力範圍之下。它旣然有了這樣的勢力，那裏還把中國看到眼裏，所以更是不斷的侵犯中國的邊境：漢高帝七年（民國紀元前二一一一年），因爲它屢次侵擾，便發了三十二萬大軍去討伐，不想中了它的誘敵之計，在平城（現在山西大同縣東）被它圍了七日夜，才得逃回；到了漢惠帝三年（民國紀元前二一〇三年），它因爲中國當時是呂太后掌權，便由冒頓單于（單于是匈奴的政治領袖，和中國的皇帝一樣）寫了一封「辭極褻慢」的信給呂太后，信裏說了不少褻凟的話，當時呂太后大怒，立刻召集大臣會議，要殺了它的使臣，發兵去討伐它；但因當時的兵力實在抵當它不過，所以只好忍着氣去敷衍它，和它「和親」了—「和親」是漢時才有的極可怪極可恥的「懷柔政策」，就是把中國皇家的女兒嫁給外國皇帝作妃子，借着這種親戚關係，來維持兩國的邦交。以上兩件事，都是漢朝極大的羞恥，所以漢武帝卽位之初（民國紀元前二〇五一年），就想重重的給它一個敎訓，使它不敢藐視中國。那時中國因爲五六十年太平無事，國家富庶得很，很有力量來和匈奴作戰，所以就發兵去攻打它，一連幾决，它果然也有些畏懼中國的意思了。武帝天漢元年（民國紀元前二〇一一年）匈奴　犂湖單于死了，他的弟弟被立爲且鞮侯單于，且鞮侯單于恐怕中國趁着它國裏有喪事的時侯來討伐它，所以極力和中國要好—把以前扣留的中國使臣，一齊送回中國，武帝認爲匈奴是誠心向蕃，也就不問以前的事情，派了使臣！了金錢去和它修好；在這個時侯，便產生了蘇武的故事：</p>
<p>蘇武字子卿，京兆杜陵（現在陝西的西安）人；他的父親蘇建，本來是一個軍官，曾經好幾决參與討伐匈奴的戰役，所以他在幼小的時侯，就很有愛國的思想了。</p>
<p>這次他被派爲和匈奴修好的使臣，同行的還有副使張勝假吏（就是暫時充任的職員）常惠等人。他們到了匈奴把金錢交給且鞮侯單于；又說了許多親善的話；不想匈奴的意思，本來是恐怕中國趁着它國家有喪事的來討伐它，這才假意來和中國要好；現在看到中國不但不討伐它；不但不提前事；倒給它許多金錢，以爲中國是怕它了；於是乎且鞮侯單于在接受了中國的賜與以後，就大大的驕傲起來，這實在是中國意想不到的事啊！</p>
<p>恰巧在這個時候發生了一個謀殺匈奴貴臣的事件，事實是這樣的：有幾個亡命在匈奴的人，和匈奴的猴王（歸附漢朝的）商量着要趁單于外出的時候，迫脅單于的母親投降中國；又要把漢奸衛律（衛律本來是中國人，後來投降了匈奴，單于因爲他很會作漢奸，所以很喜歡他，封他作丁靈王，在匈奴很有權勢。）殺死，作爲投降中國時的「見面禮」。在這些人當中，有一個呌做虞常的，他在中國的時候，和副使張勝很要好，所以他們商量這件事情，虞常想把張勝也拉在裏面，於是乎虞常就跑到中國使館裏，和張勝說道：「衛律做了漢奸，竟在單于前邊計劃些對漢朝不利的事，聽說漢天子十二分的恨他。我因爲這個很想把他殺死；但恐怕力量不够，我的計劃不能實現，所以要你帮忙一下。這事假若辦成了的話，豈不替國家除了一個大患。」張勝聽了這話，就應許了他。又給了他許多金錢，使他分給同謀的人。計劃定，只等實行了。</p>
<p>一個月以後，單于出去打獵去了，留守的只有單于的母親和其餘的家屬，虞常他們認爲時機已到，打算卽日起事；不想在他們同黨中却出了一個漢奸，趁着夜間跑到單于家裏去自首。單于的子姪兄弟們聽了這個消息，便起兵把這一羣人包圍起來，結果是猴王和其他的人完全戰死；而虞常呢，却單單的被他活捉了去。</p>
<p>單于回來了，把這一案完全交給衛律去審判，這時却慌了張勝，恐怕事情一洩，連這前來修好的漢使，都要脫不掉關係。所以他就把虞常來找他的事情，完全報告了蘇武。蘇武聽了張勝的話，說道：</p>
<p>「事實旣然這樣，我們一定是脫不掉關係的了。我們本來是修好的使臣，這回却因爲麥加暴動的計劃被他們殺死，這不但辜負了國家的使命；同時也汚辱了國家的地位，與共在他們唾駡鞭打以後再被殺死；還不如自殺來得爽快了。」</p>
<p>蘇武說完這話，立刻就要自殺，經張勝常惠兩人苦苦勸止。這樣，只有等待着未來的不幸了。</p>
<p>虞常受刑不過，果然供出了同謀的張勝。單于見了這個供詞，簡直要把所有的憤怒完全發洩在漢使身上。他立刻召集貴臣會議，要把漢使完全殺死；不想他的左伊秩訾王（匈奴王號）却不贊成他這種小題大作的行爲，左伊秩訾王說：「僅僅謀殺一個衛律，便要把漢使完全殺死；那麽萬一有人要謀殺單于，更當如何去加重他的刑罰呢？」所以他竭力主張不殺漢使，而令他投降。</p>
<p>單于聽了左伊秩訾王的話，也就放棄了原有的主張；但因爲要令漢使投降，所以派了衛律去到漢使館去傳喚蘇武。蘇武見衛律來傳喚他，就用佩刀自殺。衛律趕過去奪了佩刀，把蘇武抱住。蘇武昏了過去。衛律把醫生找來。在地上鑿了一個淺淺的坑，坑裏滿佈了火炭，把蘇武就放在這坑的上面，用火來烤他的肚皮；又用指指他的背，直至出血，蘇武才蘇醒過來。</p>
<p>單于知道了這事，很佩服蘇武的氣節——每天朝夕兩次派人來問侯蘇武的傷勢。過了一些日子，蘇武的傷已經痊愈，這時單于便又要想方法來使他投降了。</p>
<p>當虞常執行死刑那一天，單于把蘇武張勝一併押到了刑塲陪斬，打算借着虞常來威嚇他們使他們投降。虞常斬殺完了，監斬的衛律便提着刀到了張勝身前，大聲說道：</p>
<p>「張勝謀殺單于近臣，依法應當執行死刑，不過單于有個命令；「投者免罪」！」</p>
<p>他說完了這話，立刻把刀提起，這時的張勝，眞眞丟臉——竟屈服跪在地下了。</p>
<p>張勝已經投降，衛律便用同樣的手段來對付蘇武；那知道蘇武本打算拚着一死來作一個模範人物，那裹還把生死放在腦海裏，所以雖然衛律那裏好像是要手起刀落；蘇武的眼裏却和沒有看見一樣。</p>
<p>衛律知道蘇武是不能够用武力來屈服的，所以也就改變了方法——把威嚇變成了誘惑，裝着很親熱很誠懇的樣子，和蘇武說道：</p>
<p>「蘇先生！我在中國，本來是個窮人；自從降順了匈奴以後，單于對待我眞正是「恩重如山」，他封我作丁靈王；使我統帥着好幾萬人馬；使我畜養着漫山漫野的牛羊，富貴到了這樣，誰不羨慕我？蘇先生！蘇先生！你今日投降了匈奴，明天一樣能够這樣。白白的因為不投降失掉了性命；可是又有誰來知你的情啊？」</p>
<p>這是何等卑鄙何等汚濁的話，當然的，蘇武仍舊和沒有聽見一樣；不想衛律不識趣，却獰笑着說道；</p>
<p>蘇先生！你今天不降，後來可不要反悔。你今天不聽我的話，到了後悔的時候，就是想見我，也見不着了！」</p>
<p>這話——允其是最後的兩句話。實在大大的侮辱了蘇武。所以半天沒有開口的蘇武，這時却忍不住大駡道：</p>
<p>「漢奸！你這不知羞恥的漢奸！我是大漢的使臣！我是頂天立地的男子！我見你這漢奸作什麽？南越國殺了漢使，中國便把它屠了；宛王殺了漢使，中國便把他斬了；朝鮮國殺了漢使，中國便把它滅了。匈奴殺了我，也正是匈奴滅亡的時侯。我爲什麼要投降？」</p>
<p>衛律知道蘇武是萬不能够投降的了，就把這威嚇和誘惑的經過，完全報告給單于，單于得了他的報告，更是加倍的佩服蘇武的人格，因此，也就更是加倍的希望他投降。</p>
<p>他們把蘇武關在一座空的米窖裏，好幾天沒有給他食物；恰巧天下了雪，蘇武便把雪和着旃毛一併咽下去。他們見餓不倒他，又把他遷徙到北海沒有人的地方去牧公羊（北海是匈奴極北邊的地方。）當他去的時侯，單于狠狠的對他說道：「公羊產了羊羔的時侯，你再回來吧！」——意思是說他永遠不會放回來了。</p>
<p>蘇武到了北海以後，寒冷和寂寞自然不用多說；他們有時還故意的和他爲難！常常好幾天不給他一點食物。蘇武沒有東西吃，只好去吃一些草的子；有時餓得禁小起了，便捉老鼠吃。在這種「受活罪」的環境下，還要替他們來牧羊；但旁人在牧羊的時侯，向例是拿一條樹枝或鞭子；而蘇武呢，他永遠是拿着「節」—「節」是那時侯皇帝給的一種證物，有了這「節」，便可以瞪明這人是實在受了皇帝的命令。蘇武的意思，以爲這「節」便是中國的代表。所以他永遠拿着「節」，也就是表示他永遠不忘中國！</p>
<p>恰巧在這個時候，投降來一個軍官李陵—李陵是奉命來討伐匈奴的，因爲被匈奴的軍隊包圍住，他苦戰好久，沒有方法逃走，上峯又猜忌他，救兵不到，他就投降了匈奴；單于封他作右校王，也很喜歡他。他在中國的時候，和蘇武在一起作事，交誼很好；但他這决來到匈奴，却羞答答的，一直十幾年不敢去見蘇武。</p>
<p>後來，單于知道李陵和蘇武的交誼很好，就想利用李陵去引誘蘇武；他又知道蘇武的爲人，是不能够用什麽富貴榮華來引誘的，所以他又想利用李陵從漢朝來的事實，借此勸蘇武投降：說蘇武的家庭已經完全破產，借着這個來變換他對於漢朝的觀念。</p>
<p>李陵受了單于的命令，就來到北海，替蘇武擺上了酒；又作了許多很難聽的胡樂。兩入吃了一會兒酒，李陵便慢慢的答訕着說道：</p>
<p>「單于知道我和你很有交誼，所以這决讓我來同你談談。子卿！現在無論是誰，都知道你是萬不能够再回漢庭的了；你却在這裏自尋苦惱，是爲了什麽呢？在我沒有來到匈奴以前，你的哥哥和弟弟都犯了罪自殺了；我來的時候，你們老太太已經死了；你們太太年紀是輕輕的，聽說已經嫁人了：家裏僅僅賸下兩個妹妹一個男孩子和兩個女孩子，現在已經又過了十幾年，是不是還在人世，簡置不敢推測，你却在這裏自尋苦惱，是爲了什麽呢？」</p>
<p>蘇武聽了這話，說道：</p>
<p>「愛國的人，向例是不顧家的。我已經决心這樣作了，請你不必多說廢話吧。」</p>
<p>李陵討了個沒趣，只好把這事放在一旁，不去談它。過了幾天，又來向蘇武說道：「子卿！請你聽從了我的話吧！」</p>
<p>蘇武見他又來勸降，很慷慨的說道</p>
<p>「我是早就要死的人了。右棟王你一定要這樣的不留餘地，我不如就死在你的眼前吧。」</p>
<p>李陵見他這樣愛國，感動得大哭起來，說道：</p>
<p>「義士啊！義士啊！我和衛律眞該慚愧死了！」</p>
<p>說完，便拭着眼淚走了。</p>
<p>後元二年（民國紀元前一九九八年），漢武帝死了，蘇武得到這個消息，便天天哭號起來；不想在這個時候，蘇武却得了生還祖國的機會。原來匈奴且鞮侯單于在幾年前已經死掉，現在匈奴的統治者是他的孫子壺衍鞮單于。壺衍鞮單于看到國裏，一天比一天的衰落，恐怕中國趁着這個時候來討伐它，所以他非常和中國要好，這時中國是漢昭帝在位，也就接受了他的善意，派了使臣到匈奴去。</p>
<p>使臣到了匈奴，問到蘇武等幾個人，單于說他們已經死了，使臣只好回國復命。第二决漢使又到了匈奴，常惠得到消息，立刻偷着跑到漢使館，把蘇武遷徙到北海的事實，完全報告給漢使（常惠等人是在蘇武遷徙到北海以後，被匈奴監視起來的）。這使臣聽見蘇武實在沒有死亡，歡喜得很；常惠又敎給他：只說是漢天子打獵的時候，射下一隻帶着信的大雁，信裏邊說着這樣的話。不要說明是常惠洩漏的。</p>
<p>使臣見了單于，便用常惠敎給他的話，來責備單于。單于果然信了這話，立刻向使臣請求饒恕他前决不說實話的罪；接着就把蘇武等人完全放了回來。</p>
<p>當蘇武回國那一天，李陵備了酒宴爲他送行，向他說道：</p>
<p>「你這决回國，眞是空前絕後的榮譽，古時雖然也有愛國的人，却不如你這樣偉大。可憐我，自從投降了匈奴以後，老母妻子，都受了我的連累，死在刀斧之下，現在比起你來，眞眞是天壤之別了。」</p>
<p>說完了，便哭着起來告辭回去。</p>
<p>始元六年（民國紀元前一九九二年）的春天，蘇武回到長安，天子拜他作典屬國的官（典屬國就是管理屬國的官）；賜他錢二百萬：田地二頃；住宅一所。當他出使匈奴的時侯，本來是很强壯的；現在他的頭髮和鬍子，早就完全變白—他已經十九年沒有看見祖國了。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3>出版界與讀書界（續）</h3>
<p>— 莊心在</p>
<p>—也該來一次整飭運動—</p>
<p>出版是文化事業，而並不僅僅是商品的傾銷，以量言，近年來中國的出版事業，誠然不能不算發達，但除了移東搬西改頭換面的書籍外，究竟有幾多本較有價値？除了掘骸骨販洋貨的期刋外究竟有幾多種較有意義？譬如說曾國藩先生的遺著吧，凑成淸代中興四大名臣集是一種出版物，曾文正公全集又是一種，拆開來會文正公家書啊，詩文啊，奏議啊，日記啊，尺牘啊等等又是好幾種，截長補短，七拚八凑曾文正公的政治主張，經濟政策，評傳等等又是好幾種，此外曾文正公選集當然又是一種，新式標點曾文正公集又是一種，白話註釋曾文正公集又是一種，又可以把會文正公某一部份的著述編入某一種書籍，例如歷代名人日記，淸代尺牘類抄之類，再聰明進步些當然會編成曾國藩與李鴻章比較研究之類的鴻著了，這樣便搆成了豐富的出版界。再說近代的。文藝作家，誰不是將自己的作品七編八編的弄成某某集，某某全集，某某選集，某某自選集，某某代表作之類的種種花樣呢？雜誌期刊，當前自以漫畫小品文爲最多，但除了抄錄古文中的幽默筆記笑話聯話書啟之類以及翻譯東西幽默，甚至翻印外報的諷刺畫，照片以外，還是些什麽內容呢？出版界的發達，是循着這樣可憐的途徑。</p>
<p>出版界的對象是讀書界，讀書界大體分兩方面而言，一是啟蒙通俗的一般知識，這是出版界的普遍運動；一是特研精究的專門學術，這是出版界精進運動。以前者言，中國已吾有一套滿意的敎科書，有一套善美的通俗讀物，除了粗製濫造的敎本，以及荒唐汚穢的說部畫册以外。以後者言，中國出版界不少的是某某學綱要，某某學大意，要找幾本專門精深的著述，除了翻譯以外，怕是很難的了。中國出版界對於讀書界的貢獻，也可以說對於文化的貢獻，能够呌人滿意嗎？</p>
<p>我以爲出版界也應該來一次嚴正整飭的運動，不要儘以幾折幾扣大廉價大贈品來號召，何妨從生意眼中鑽出來，反省反省本身偉大的文化的使命，不要純以讀書界爲生意上的顧主，而儘量投向一般低級的嗜好，正該負起糾正讀者興趣導引學術上進的任務，在一般的讀物上嚴格編制，注入新的健全的意義，抵達國難時期敎育的方針，而完成全國讀書運動。在專門的讀物上有計劃地盡量多出有價値有意義的專著研究集，自然是項出版品在生意眼上，往往爲書店老闆所厭棄，不過，我以爲很可以請求政府的獎掖，政府方面爲策進民族文化運動，鼓勵學術研究起見，自應該量予濟助。至於期刊方面，應該减少玩物喪志的物質精神，而移向於壯志氣，長知識的正途，這見解並不是迂腐，當此國難時期，我們是吾應該珍惜一分物質一分精神以獲取相當的代價，想來不會再有閒神餘力來消閒幽默吧！</p>
<p>讀書界對着出版界，應當抱着監察者的態度，以祇要讀有用的書，只要看有裨於救亡與國的出版品為原則，要是讀書界有着這樣的需求，站在供給方面的出版界，自然更易於適應。</p>
<p>近年以來明瞭出版界情形的人們，都曉得除了一家資力較爲雄厚的書店以外，一般的書業，除了翻印古籍照出敎科書，編行試題解答等等以外，久已入於休止狀態，實在談不到什麼出版的意義，爲要突破這重危機，我以爲讀書界與出版界都應該有一番覺悟，相助相成，建立一個中心來共同努力。</p>

<p>第一章是緒論，首述中國今日，已到存亡一髮的關頭。舉國上下，應謀民族之復興。而民族之復興，實有賴於敎育之改造。我國過去敎育，乃消費敎育，書本敎育，治術敎育，危害國家·社會·個人實爲今日之一大問題。次述我國貧困交迫之原因，乃帝國主義之侵略，封建殘餘的作祟，政治方面之失調，經濟建設之簡陋與社會心理之影響。生產敎育乃對症下藥而發，以達「救國先救貧，敎民先敎富」之目標。</p>
<p>第二章是生產敎育發展史，分爲三期。幼稚時期始於光緒末年，學部頒行之實業學堂通則。發育時期乃自民國十五年許崇淸發表敎育方針草案，主張以生產敎育列入敎育方針。長成期是生產敎育爲敎育方針所規定，由希望而實踐了，政府亦頒定生產敎育實施事項，各地的實施，便也風起雲湧。</p>
<p>第三章是生產敎育的意義和目標。言人人殊，然牠的涵義，則有下列諸說：</p>
<h3>書店雜景（續）</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>四，送新聞—日報新聞欄中，所謂某書店某書已幾版，如何如何受歡迎等情，均不過是各書店自己送去的廣告。</p>
<p>五，書評或書報介紹——除了以前劉英士編的圖書評論月刋及少數的雜誌如文化建設，中國農村月刋等外，所有的所謂書評，大多都是廣告。致送這種廣告的方法各有不同，有作者自己假用筆名，寫了一篇送去的，有請別人寫了送去的，也有自己寫了，請編者或其他名人加上一個名字刋出的。據說，甚至有書局出錢包下雜誌的書報評論欄，自行送稿刊出的。這種情形實際上並不足怪，你不見各報上什麽學校的特刊，什麽公司的新聞，形式上好像是第三者的報告，實則是化了廣告費的別一形式的廣告。同樣作爲商業組絨的書店，自然也有其用廣告欺騙讀者的權利。</p>
<p>六，作序——允其所謂名人學者的序，千篇一例的是互相吹捧，廣告而已。</p>
<p>七，名人文章——這主要的限用於雜誌爲多。</p>
<p>八，獎學金，讀書會——祇要你看，這如由某一書店發起，有沒有不讀共本店書籍的？卽使不是由書店直接發起，書店也頗有利用這種機會的。</p>
<p>此外，尙有許多方法，惟視各書店運用的手段如何，如官廳嘉獎，某某機關推薦等，也多是書店運動而來。（完）</p>

<h3>怎樣利用春假？</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>旅行是一種樂事，這大家都知道了。可是旅行的意義並不止於徘徊山間永涯，旅行可鍛鍊身心，增加閱歷。諺云：「百聞不如一見」正是這個道理。</p>
<p>旅行且含着深刻的敎育意味。英美法德意日蘇俄等國都積極提倡此種敎育運動。最著如德國之學校旅行。大中小學皆可參加，小學生於每學期有一週或十天的時間，沿着河流森林旅行，大中學生更到鄰國去考察自然政治經濟社會敎育人文地理等情形。至於日本之旅遊團，意大利之巴里拉Ballia會員，蘇俄的少年先鋒隊員皆有定期的旅行組織，由此可知旅行於敎育上之重要了。</p>
<p>我國近年來各地學校也提倡旅行。平時除自由出外參觀外，敎部還定於每年四月一日起放春假一星期。今年大中學如期舉行，小學則延至四月五日，下面是我們所可實行的旅行組織計劃：</p>
<p>社會調查團：指定地點，對於其地之人口，財富，土地，生產，風俗習慣及建設等作一番簡括調查以供參考。</p>
<p>敎育考察團：指定地點，考察其學校及社會敎育，對其設備，經費，建築物，敎職員，學生，成續及課外活動，允須注意其特點。</p>
<p>經濟視察團：無論農邨或都市都可視察其生產，消費，貨物之流通及金融之週轉等等。</p>
<p>標本採集隊：無論生物或礦物皆可採集，製成標本爲日常研究之用。</p>
<p>攝影實習；有志攝影者，乘此假期，到山明水秀的地方，作攝影實習，互相切磋，身心及技藝皆有裨益。</p>
<p>童軍軍訓露營：到各地露營，一面可練習集團生活，一面可領略自然界及董事上的常識。</p>
<p>婦女觀光團：城市的婦女到鄉村去，鄉村的婦女到城市去，彼此觀摩，交換智識。</p>
<p>以上七種是基本的旅行組織，因情形可自行變換。計劃上的應注意之事，如目的，經費，團員及應用物件都要事先認定及籌足。有錢的人或伴侶旅行固好，但總不若加入團體旅行較有益，因爲集團旅行中，人數多，費用省，可以公開參觀機關，工厰或學校，而且還可互相照料。倘能邀同敎職員參加，其興趣更爲濃厚。</p>
<h3>園主人</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>『洛水伯伯』我喊着。</p>
<p>『飯吃過了未，又好幾天不見了。』</p>
<p>洛水伯伯靄然微笑地問着。隨着我們就坐在已經零落的只勝了錯雜的枯籐的葡萄棚下的一條石凳上，我們並不需要馬上開始說話，而倒嗜好在沉默中領略或者咀嚼各人的心事，以及眼前的景緞，我的眼睛向着簇簇的樹林那邊在幻變着多樣奇異的霞彩的夕陽，貪婪地鑑賞着。洛水伯伯却儘管咕咕地抽他的旱烟斗，等到遠處的東西完全被暮霧吞沒了，才把眼綫縮回來，茅舍裹的一盞荳油燈突地亮起來了，我方意識着洛水伯伯不知什麼時候離開我走去點燃的，在走出來的路上他說：</p>
<p>『正是九月天的日脚便短得這樣了。』</p>
<p>除了那盞昏沉沉的燈從屋內射出一個淡弱的尖圈的身外四邊整個兒龍罩在黑暗裹了。狗已好像早睡過去，不知名的蟲聲漸漸繁密地聒絮起來打近處的池塘，草株中發出。洛水伯伯重新坐到石凳來，忽然用了帶着感慨的語調說道：</p>
<p>『這幾天晚上老是有人上園來偸挖竹筍。那幾個閒蕩的壞傢伙所幹我都明白的。他們欺我年老，以爲沒法子。其實我是放鬆一下，不想一决一决地越大膽了』接着他又說：</p>
<p>『日子難過誰不是一樣，而這班壞傢伙有氣力不尋活計，偏揀邪道走，年輕的人不慣吃苦，貪懶，大家都甘願沒出息，我活了這般老，什麼看透了。却還沒看到像現在年輕人這樣懦弱，無力</p>
<p>『但你終不能讓他們一直偸下去的。』</p>
<p>『是的，這兩天我差不多整夜沒睏。好，專門在等着，不過「做賊一更，守賊一夜」……</p>
<p>時候不早了，我告別了主人，走出園門，幸好月正照滿一地，省得在暗裹摸索。而狠輕易走去，但一下子思想十分陰鬰着，我回味着洛水伯伯剛才的一番話，我想起他一個人單獨地在這園子中送過悠遠的歲月，一點也不寂寞。在悠遠的歲月中，他的足踪好像從來不會踏出　門一步，這大概就是他慘惡着續紛的粗俗的人世間，所以當五十歲那年死了妻子，便乾脆地撇開了一切，伶仃個子跑到這河邊，造一間茅舍，圍着矮竹籬笆，决心隔絕所有的糾纏，在這樣孤零寂寞的環境中度過殘生。……</p>
<p>「可是，這日子如今亦不能讓他好好過的了。」</p>
<p>洛水伯伯一定有這樣的太息與憤慨。因爲現在有人時時來偸他辛苦培種起來的東西，我知道他被人偸了一天的竹笋，便將缺少去一天的菜料的。</p>
<p>在離家鄉的數年當中，我永遠眷懷着年老的溫和的園主人洛水伯伯，在數年後的最近時候終於聽到一段不幸的消息：</p>
<p>—洛水伯伯在一個冬天夜裹死去了，幾天後人才發覺，因爲那地方人是不大去的。</p>
<p>一個是鄉間來的人告訴我。我有些黯然了。洛水伯伯就這樣寂寞的活着又寂寞的回去啊！</p>
<h3>隕落</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>初春的陽光馴和地鋪在街道上，尖峭的寒風已經沒有了，子兪先生在半日的奔忙中，身上有點烘烘的熱，而心頭，則黏着一層拂拭不掉的煩燥與憂急，這感覺，慢慢地凝固起來，又不斷地滋長着。到最後，竟使他對於一切都感到一種紛雜的糢糊與難解了：這時代是奇怪的，這世界是不可解的，一切都是糢糢糊糊的，事業是這樣，生活是這樣，命運也是這樣。</p>
<p>「總之，我們的日子已經完了—我相信，我早就那麼說—任何可怕的命運—貧窮也好，飢餓也好，死亡也好—要來的就讓牠來吧！」</p>
<p>滿身帶着憂煩與念燥，子兪先生，茫然地回到那烏黑的被稱做「家」的那一個房間要（在那裏，存在着一個除了生孩子以外什麼也不知道的女人，和四個同野猪那麼糟的孩子，整天地憤懣與囂擾，在那麼汚穢，狹小，而幽黑的「家」裹。）。孩子們不休地呌囂着，身上騰起一陣悶熱，把一頂破舊的呢帽不耐煩地從頭上摘了下來，憤懣地向屋角裹的那張骯髒的床上丟去。瞧着在發呆的妻，恨恨地說：「又落了空！這日子我再也過不下去了，我們完了！我們——」</p>
<p>妻子依然茫茫地在發呆，子兪先生無可奈何地嘆了口氣，那種感覺，不知道是憂傷還是麻木，却深深地在沉下去，又落到籌思的磨子裏去了，思索不斷地被磨輾着，磨輾着……</p>
<p>眞的，子兪先生，一天比一天更淸楚地覺得；他自己是「確實」在消沉，在隕落下去了。像「他」那種人，在「我們」的這個時代，不用疑慮，是一定沒有多大的「日子」可以過的。五十多歲，識點字，讀過點「聖賢」的書，有過一點不大的遺產，生活過一點不算得「壞」（至少，是安寗的）日子，有着一個什麼也沒有，而僅僅是贅累得像蝸牛殼一樣的「家」……於是，時代的波浪用着可驚的速度向前走去，外面的世界是現代的，科學的，社會學的了；而內在的「人」却依舊是十八世紀之東方的，宗敎的，靈學的……漸漸地，子兪先生開始在生活的衰落中擔起憂來：外面的世界太奮進，太年靑：而自己則眞的是太無能，太衰老了：這時代已經不再是他們的—他</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>們的無能的「淡泊寗靜」的世紀風已經去遠—遠遠地，像古舊的夕風那樣地吹去了。</p>
<p>淡泊髯靜的安閒日子已是過去了好久的事了，而世界變得那麽壞，「空混」也成為不可能的事了。到外面去做事，據說要「大面子」，要懂得點「交際」，要洋文…可是自己和這些差得多遠哪。生活的鐵手一秒鐘都不肯放鬆地緊緊地抓住他，而跟着來的又是一天天的憂急，一天天的奔走，一天天的失望……</p>
<p>「我們的日子是完了，」子兪先生想：「自己也已經是五十多歲的人，也可以完了…」</p>
<p>然而，那無知的女人，還有一羣屬於未來的世界的孩子呢……？—想起這，子兪先生覺得眼睛裏有一點潤濕；從自己身上他看到了他們的命運：他們也將毫無疑慮地被時代的波浪所掩沒；毫無疑慮的，像一顆永久是黯晦的星一樣，隕落下去，隕落下去……</p>
<p>「隕落下去！」他不敢再想了，這悲劇把他磨輾得已經足够。他茫然地抬起頭：外面的初春的太陽照得他眼睛發花</p>
<h3>陸二嫂</h3>
<p>— 丁</p>
<p>從瀋陽逃出來，我孤獨的而又驚恐的沿着那兩條被災難所摧毀的吉海路的鋼軌往家鄕一步一步的走。九月的山野喘息着暴怒，叢鬱鬱的樹林，野草，在不平靜的季節裏生長着。我攢着鐵路的山洞，我爬着深陡的溝谷，我踏着狹小的平原。在撫順小客店中，我受了一次的檢査，深夜裏我被牽到秋雨淅瀝院落裏，向着無邊的黑暗默默的跪着。第二天我向着滿城所高懸着的一面一面的飄　的太陽旗，傷神的看了一眼，我又是奔着我的路程。到了海龍，離我家鄉已經不遠了，只消再有兩天的時光，我便可以結束我的路程。那知還未到朝陽鎭，聽說前面在三天之前就起了戰爭，於是我改變了我的路錢，一直朝着矗峙在烟霧中那隱的的我家鄉的牛心頂子山峯走去。</p>
<p>家鄕，變了色的家鄉已現在我的眼前了。</p>
<p>回家的第三天，我便下鄉去了。那個地方呌東陽堡，離城有六十里。在那兒有我父親所經營的一個燒酒工廠。我父親是常年住在工廠裏。可是現在工廠的烟囱已不再噴着黑烟了。因此，父親苦惱的每天用烟袋鍋子敲桌子。日子一天一天的混亂，火車仍在睡着覺，大路上也沒有裝貨車的踪跡，工廠的酒一大缸一大缸的存在倉庫裏。八十多個工人每天　着父親不讓他喘一喘氣。他們是在追討兩個月沒有發的工錢。父親往往被逼得沒法可想時，他讓我出頭來和工入交涉。然而我有什麼法呢？我只不過吿訴父親能够快一些想法弄一筆錢給他　　　　　　　也沒有了。我的　並不能解除父親的痛苦。他終究沒有想出一點應付他們的辦法來。這樣，工人實在沒有忍耐性了，個個在說着一串粗魯的話和父親爭長道短。</p>
<p>—你當經理的要知道我們工人的困難……</p>
<p>—我們有老婆，孩子，還得吃飯…</p>
<p>—現在時局這樣的木安，你不能困我們這裏。</p>
<p>這是他們的話。</p>
<p>父親一邊着急，一邊和我發脾氣。</p>
<p>有一天，從外邊跑進一個三十幾歲的女人來，這女人是工人陸祥的老婆，人家都跟她呌陸二嫂。她闖到父親的房間，氣粗粗的，用手指劃着父親的臉，怒汹汹的嚕囌：「…我來跟你要工錢，你不能白白用人，你也要生兒養女，要憑良心，我們全家都在張着口挨餓，你快一點，你快一點，今天不給可不行……」</p>
<p>父親啞口無聲，他讓我把門帶上，並且讓我看看窗外有沒有人。他鬼一般的瞪了瞪眼，低聲的對陸二嫂說：「我可以給你想辦法，不過你不能跟別人說，吾則這麼些人我是沒有法應付。」說着說着，父親從腰裏掏出好幾張鈔票授給她</p>
<p>就在那天晚上，除了沒有陸祥的影子之外，那八十多個工人，瘋狂一般的擁擠在父親的房間裏。父親已經被他們揪在地下。房間裏充滿着一片吵聲。</p>
<p>—陸祥他老婆好看，為什麽給他工錢不給我們？</p>
<p>你是喝了陸二嫂的米湯了嗎？</p>
<p>沒有幾分鐘，父親已經允許發工錢給他們。</p>
<p>工廠死靜了。</p>
<p>住了幾天我是回到城裏了。不久，東陽堡也是一條火的陣綫。父親逃回城裏來說：陸祥死了。</p>
<p>當我二决到東陽堡去，父親所經營的那個燒酒工廠已經燬滅了。荒凉的山脚下那片小平原，高高的堆積着丘崗似的一堆碎物。</p>
<p>在那裏我找不出什麼可値得回憶的事。</p>
<p>然而當我憶起死在火綫裏的陸祥，他那被遺棄的陸二嫂的影子，却開始在我的腦子裏活躍了。她，她頒着她的孩子到那裏去了呢？我心裏是一片空虛。</p>

<p>周公館的人　，佈置華麗。周家的老僕人—魯貴跟他的女兒—四鳳在着。她也是周家的使女。因為她長得聰慧活潑，給周家的大少爺—周薛愛上了。她的父親知道這個，因此他常以這來耍挾向她的女兒要踐用，此刻他又在說着要着這一套。…四鳳在煎煮着太太—周繁漪吃的藥，厭煩他叨叨的嘮絮。</p>
<p>魯貴的兒子—大海，由於他父親的推荐，在老爺—周樸園的礦上做工頭，他非常倔强憨直，三二日前礦工罷了工，工人們請他代表來要求他們的董事長（即周樸園）撫卹被警察打死或受傷的工友，這時走進來要見董事長，可是，却內有客而給魯貴—他的父親命令他久等在門旁裏。</p>
<p>四鳳不是說給大少爺愛着嗎？但是，他的弟弟周冲也在愛着她，他在花園中一路喊着四鳳：四鳳快進來，他的爸爸在隔房聽見了，却討了一個沒趣的訛責退回去，四鳳從朶避的地方站起來，正打算端藥上樓去。他的太太却已走到樓下了。</p>
<p>周繁漪是一「中國舊式女人」，她「哀靜」，「明慧」，「對于詩文的愛好」。……</p>
<p>他的兒子周冲重後的走上來，他見着母親，使他不得不吐露出他愛四鳳的心意，可是，這心意幷沒有得到他母親同意的回聲。他的母親許久沒有看見他的哥哥周萍了，於是母子倆談着他了，他也覺得哥哥近來跟母親的感情不如從前了，他口中說出「從前愛過不應該愛的一個女人」作為他哥哥對他談及的這句話來作結束時，母親終於給這句話投入了追憶的痛苦中。他哥哥所認為「愛過一個不應該愛的女人」，就是二三年前的繁漪—他的母親啊。</p>
<p>正談着，周冲回頭望門外，哥哥周萍也走進了來，他的臉容蒼白，近來他簡直怕見他的母親，他雖然剛走來，可是，他又想推託着要寫信而想離開她，—甚至於他决定離開這個家庭到鑛上去。</p>
<p>我前面說過，周樸園不是在會客嗎？現在他把客送走了之後，也踱到大廳裏，他的妻兒都在着。</p>
<p>他的性格是說怎樣就得怎樣的，當他堅通着二個兒子抱着母親硬要她把藥吃下去的時候，使大家流着痛苦的眼淚不歡的各自離開去。　……第一幕完……</p>

<h3>浪淘沙將公演</h3>
<p>中國電影題村，因受着各方面的影響，而日益感到枯窘，那是顯然的事實，在這種情形下，「浪淘沙」可以說是開拓新題材的一部影片</p>
<p>「一個善良的人，在偶然不幸的遭遇中會犯罪；一個奉公守法的偵探，他永遠追求着他所要逮捕的罪犯。當他們兩個人站在同一的生命綫上時，他們會放棄了敵視而變成極高貴的友情，但是一旦遇到了利害衝突，和人慾的激動，他們會立刻恢復了敵意。這一類的悲劇，永遠在人與人之間產生着。」</p>

<h3>Jin Suppresses Bandit Troops: Ordered to Search and Eliminate Remaining Bandits, Xu Haidong Leads Troops Fleeing Back to Shaanxi, Chen Cheng to Inspect Frontlines, Han Wanjun Sends Representative to Taiyuan</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Haidong led over two thousand men from the false 25th Army, attempting to cross the river from Lan County back to Shaanxi. On the 30th, they were attacked by our Cao regiment at Shuitan, and the bandits fled in two groups, north and south. Chen Cheng, at the invitation of the Education Department, lectured to students of various schools in Taiyuan University yesterday and today. This afternoon he toured the Jin Ancestral Temple, and tomorrow he is scheduled to inspect the frontlines. Lu Han sent representative Zhao Shouchong to Taiyuan to discuss military affairs for suppressing the bandits. Zhao arrived in Taiyuan last night and paid respects to Yan this morning. Wan Fulin sent representative Wu Songlin to Taiyuan to visit the閣 [likely referring to a high official]. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yan Xishan telegraphed Sun Chu, ordering him to quickly dispatch troops to search and eliminate remaining bandits in the recovered bandit areas, rescuing the people from their suffering. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) British military officer Fo Lei Sai [transliteration] told Reuters reporters today that Chinese government airplanes had dropped letters at Hongdong and Pingyang, ordering foreign missionaries in those two places to use the designated code to indicate the exact number of foreign men, women, and children inside and outside the city, and other information. Therefore, within twenty-four hours, Beijing will know the exact number of foreigners in those two places. Fo also stated that foreign women near Luan have indeed escaped to safe areas, and three male missionaries have taken refuge inside Luan city. (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan: Inspects Dagu Garrison</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Liu Jialuan, commander of the Security Forces, went to Dagu by car at nine o'clock in the morning on the 1st. He inspected Liu Ruming's division and surveyed the Tianjin-Dagu highway. He gave a speech to the Dagu garrison at noon and returned to Tianjin at two o'clock in the afternoon. In the coming days, he will tour nearby counties in the Tianjin suburbs by car and inspect the 29th Army troops. He will return to Beijing after ten days. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zhewan [likely a typo for Zheyuan], accompanied by Xiao Zhenying and others, left Tianjin by car for Dagu at seven o'clock on the morning of the 1st, inspecting the 29th Army's construction of the highway along the way. He did not return to Tianjin until two o'clock in the afternoon. (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan in Tianjin: Discusses Diplomatic Issues</h3>
<p>No Concrete Decisions Yet; Tada Hosts Banquet for Matsumuro</p>
<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan exchanged opinions with key Japanese figures in Tianjin regarding Hebei-Chahar diplomatic matters, but no concrete decisions were made. The rumor of an important meeting in Tianjin is untrue. The situation in Hebei-Chahar remains the same, without any changes. The Transportation Committee, established in Beijing, may be established within four to five days, with five to seven members. The Construction and Education Committees are also being planned. Men Zhizhong, chairman of the Construction Committee, went to Tianjin at five o'clock in the afternoon on the 1st to visit Song and discuss organizational matters. Liu Zhe is internally designated as the chairman of the Education Committee. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan said, "I am not prepared to go to Nanjing or to Shandong to meet with Han [Fuju]. The suppression of the communists in Jin is reportedly progressing smoothly. Western and Southern Jin are both peaceful. The communists who entered Jin belong to the forces of Xu Xiangqian and Peng Dehuai, numbering over ten thousand. Zhu [De] and Mao [Zedong]'s bandit gangs are still on the border between Shaanxi and Jin. The 29th Army is sufficient to cope with the communist prevention in Hebei. The entire army has four divisions, with one stationed in Chahar, two garrisoning Beijing and Tianjin, and another scattered in various locations. The purpose of peacetime training is to avoid disturbing the people, and stationing troops in various places can also maintain harmony between soldiers and civilians, so as not to arouse public resentment or be incited by the communists. Shunde and Pingxiang in Southern Hebei were tense for a time, but after dispatching a regiment of troops for suppression, they have become peaceful. The actions of the Chinese communists are no longer like they were fifteen years ago, killing and looting everywhere. The Japanese side has expressed its implementation of a communist prevention agreement for Hebei-Chahar. Although we met each other recently in Tianjin, we did not formally discuss the matter of Eastern Hebei. After Matsumuro arrived, he was also limited to social events and did not formally negotiate. Although the two sides exchanged opinions, the Japanese side's opinions were not unified, and a decision must await Nagata's return to the country and contact in Changchun. There are no immediate plans to negotiate the Chahar issue on the spot. This matter is of great importance and cannot be undertaken by a single diplomatic envoy. The expansion of the Japanese army in North China is about five thousand. The current number of stationed troops is less than three thousand, which has exceeded the quota of eight hundred permitted by the treaty. The Japanese have not indicated where the defense zone is. This matter is related to the abolition of the Nogo organization in Eastern Hebei. If it cannot be abolished, or stationed within the war zone, we must notify our side. The suppression of smuggling in North China is a major issue. I will order Lin Shize to go to Nanjing to discuss this matter, because to curb rampant smuggling, it is not possible to simply reduce taxes on Japanese goods, nor can we revise the tariff rates of various North China customs offices. However, a proper method must be devised to achieve results." (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese military department Councilor Ishii represented Tada on the 1st to inspect troops in Tangshan. The local troops will be rotated on the 12th. Ishii said that the political situation in North China is becoming clearer day by day. Northern Chahar is currently peaceful. The newly established Transportation and Construction Committees of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council hope to be realized soon. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tada hosted a banquet for Matsumuro at his official residence on the evening of the 1st, inviting Consul-General Kawagoe and his staff to accompany them. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qin Dechun, Pan Yugui, Wang Shijiu, and Liu Shifu left Tianjin for Beijing one after another on the 1st. Men Zhizhong came to Tianjin from Beijing in the evening to visit Song. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Song Zheyuan will convene his subordinates in Tianjin within the next few days to discuss internal matters. Ge Dingyuan and Lei Sishang went to Tianjin at 9:15 tonight, and Zhang Zizhong will also go soon. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) According to related sources, Song Zheyuan has contacted the Japanese side several times in Tianjin regarding the issues of Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar. Song will remain in Tianjin for another two or three days before returning to Beijing. It has not yet been decided whether he will inspect the Hebei border in the future.

<h3>Japanese Airplane: Damaged Due to Careless Landing</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9:00 a.m. on the 1st, Japanese plane No. 129 flew from Changchun to Tianjin, carrying Tianjin military department staff officer Nakai Togyo [transliteration] and senior adjutant Otake to Jin-Sui [Shanxi-Suiyuan] to scout bandit conditions. It flew back at 4:00 p.m., but the engine was damaged due to a careless landing and remained at the Dongjuzi airfield in the evening. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beijing Student Union Disbanded</h3>
<p>(Beijing) As a result of yesterday's conflict between students and police, the National University authorities have disbanded the Student Union today. Four students involved in the conflict have been expelled. (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Qin Dechun returned to Beijing at 11:15 tonight to deal with the student unrest issue. (1st Day Special Dispatch) (See Education News Column) (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tang Kesan Discusses: Dengkou Dispute Resolved, Land Administration and Other Matters Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Kesan of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, who was previously ordered to go to Ningxia to mediate the Dengkou administrative establishment dispute, has now resolved the issue. Tang has returned to Nanjing to report his mission. He told reporters on the 1st that the dispute over Dengkou's administrative establishment involved land rights, administrative rights, and taxation rights. After repeated consultations between myself, Chairman Ma of Ningxia, and Prince Da of the Alxa Banner, all misunderstandings were dispelled and the issue was resolved. The solution is that the land rights of the San Sheng Palace are confirmed as belonging to the Alxa Banner, the administrative rights still belong to Ningxia Province, but major issues must be discussed and implemented with the Prince of the Alxa Banner, and the taxation issue has also been agreed upon by both parties. The method will be submitted by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Interior to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be announced. According to my observation, this matter will not cause further complications. (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Eastern Hebei Smuggling Group: Vigorously Expanding Smuggling Sales Channels</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Last month, the Japanese imported 1.2 million packages of rayon yarn into North China. Of these, 400,000 packages were exported to the Gaoyang area of Hebei, 450,000 packages to the Zhoucun area of Shandong, and 250,000 packages to the vicinity of Tianjin. They were shipped south via the Jinpu Railway. For a time, domestic factories experienced a situation where demand exceeded supply. Currently, smuggling groups are still vigorously expanding smuggling sales channels. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Customs sent a letter to the Beijing-Ningbo and Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureaus on the 1st, ordering each station to earnestly assist the Customs in suppressing smuggling and not to transport foreign goods without tax receipts. The railway side expressed that it would be difficult to refuse to ship foreign goods without tax payment, and conflicts would be unavoidable if strictly enforced. They hope that the Customs will find a more thorough solution to avoid difficult situations. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nagata Returns to His Country via Changchun</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Nagata left Tianjin at 12:00 on the 31st via the Beijing-Tongzhou train to Changchun, where he will visit Commander Ueda of the Kwantung Army before returning to his country. He will attend a division commander conference in Tokyo on the 7th and request instructions on North China's diplomatic policy. He will return to Tianjin after twenty days. The Economic Advisory Department of the Tianjin Japanese Military Department was established on the 1st, composed of Matsumuro, Ishii, Nakai, and Manchurian Railway commissioners Yano, Aoki, Kazahaya, etc. In the morning, the first decision-making meeting was held at the military department to assist the China-Xing Company [likely a Japanese company] and the Manchurian Railway in planning economic strategies for developing North China. The meeting adjourned at noon. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beijing Suffers from Fierce Winds and Cold Weather</h3>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the North China Smuggling Issue</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>We previously discussed the issue of tax evasion and smuggling in North China, believing that complete eradication is impossible, and that at the very least, we should ensure that smuggled goods do not increase or penetrate deeper into the inland. However, since the "Provisional Measures for Tianjin Customs and the Beijing-Ningbo Railway Bureau to Cooperate in Suppressing Smuggled Goods" were implemented on March 21, only ten days have passed, and the trend of smuggling in North China has not only not abated, but has become even more rampant. Rōnin [Japanese vagrants] provide armed escort, Japanese military police interfere with smuggling suppression, and the transportation of smuggled goods to Tianjin has increased significantly compared to before. Customs officials are helpless, and smuggling suppression regulations are equivalent to waste paper. Even our minimum hope is unattainable. With the current trend, the ports of entry in North China, such as Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, will become duty-free ports for Japanese goods, and the economy of North China will fall into an irrecoverable state. This will not only disrupt our customs administration but also affect the guarantee of foreign debt interest payments.</p>
<p>We have always said that smuggling in North China is likely not simply a matter of seeking profit but rather a planned action. Judging from the recent facts, this seems increasingly credible. At the beginning of the implementation of the new measures on March 21, Nishida [transliteration], the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, visited Chen Juesheng, the director of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway Bureau, on behalf of Consul-General Kawagoe, arguing that the new anti-smuggling law discriminated against Japanese goods and lodged a verbal protest. Although our side explained earnestly, the Japanese side has not yet understood. The Beijing-Ningbo Railway Bureau has since been hesitant and unable to thoroughly assist in the suppression of smuggling. Recently, the situation has become even worse. The number of smuggling steamers at Beidaihe has increased to more than eighteen or nineteen, and Japanese military police openly interfere with smuggling suppression at the Tianjin West Station. On March 28, a bizarre incident occurred in Qinhuangdao in which customs officials were surrounded and severely injured by rōnin. At the same time, the pseudo-organizations in Eastern Hebei have set up tax checkpoints in various ports of entry within their jurisdiction, charging only one-quarter of the North China Customs tariff on smuggled goods. Rōnin then use the tax receipts from these pseudo-tax checkpoints to force passage through various ports of entry in Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao. All these actions are clearly supported by military and political forces, and their intentions are very deep and far-reaching.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, seeking the effective suppression of smuggling in North China can no longer be achieved by issuing a document ordering customs and railway officials to do so. "He who tied the bell must untie it." We should first seek a solution through diplomatic channels. However, our speculation about the Japanese side's intention is that they seem to be using this issue to create difficult facts to achieve greater goals. Although our authorities are currently constrained and cannot but set aside legal principles and accommodate the facts, diplomacy should also adhere to a certain limit. If this limit is exceeded, a decisive decision is necessary. If we delay and prolong the situation, it will only increase disputes, and the scope of smuggling will expand, further plunging North China into an unrecoverable state. At this time, amid the voices of opening up diplomacy in Hebei-Chahar, we deeply hope that the authorities will properly handle this smuggling issue, which is of vital importance to the safety of North China.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson: Denies Existence of Secret Sino-Soviet Treaty; Propaganda Serving Another Purpose; Information on the Mongolia-Soviet Agreement Currently Being Inquired About; Assassination of Han Fuju Also Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign newspapers have repeatedly reported in recent days that Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union have concluded a mutual assistance agreement, and that China and the Soviet Union had a secret agreement beforehand, so China has tacitly approved the matter. A reporter went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 1st to inquire with the authorities. According to the spokesperson, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also seen reports of the agreement between Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union and is paying close attention to it. They are currently inquiring, and it is inconvenient to express anything until the inquiry is clear. As for the foreign newspapers hastily concluding that our side has tacitly approved it, and speculating that there is already a secret agreement between China and the Soviet Union, it is naturally propaganda serving another purpose. It is common knowledge that Chen Guofu is currently in Zhenjiang presiding over Jiangsu Province's administration, and Chen Lifu is recuperating in Hangzhou. However, foreign newspapers have said that he has gone to Soviet Russia, which shows how bizarre the rumors are. The reporter then asked what about the foreign telegraph on the 1st that Shandong Chairman Han Fuju had been assassinated. He replied, "This morning, the capital still received a telegram from Chairman Han sent at noon. Please laugh off such news as well." (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign telegrams have reported that Shandong Chairman Han Fuju was assassinated. According to related sources, this matter is inaccurate. The Shandong Provincial Government's office in the capital has also not received any telegrams about this. The office's radio station was still in communication with Jinan at 6:00 p.m. on the 1st and did not mention this matter. Tang Nang, the office's Director of General Affairs, is currently in Jinan and has not sent a single word about this matter. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It was reported a few days ago that the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia had signed a mutual assistance treaty. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to this matter and has telegraphed the embassy in the Soviet Union and related parties to inquire about everything. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to express any opinions before the facts are proven. (1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Chinese authorities today denied the foreign rumors that Han Fuju was assassinated, saying that Han is in good health. (Note: A certain Japanese news agency in this city received a dispatch from Jinan today, saying that Han was assassinated late last night and is rumored to have died of serious injuries.) (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Central Political Council: Principles for Revising the Organizational Law of the Executive Yuan; Appoint Dai Chuanxian to Attend the World Games</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Dismisses: Regional Inspection Commissioners</h3>

Wang Zhanqi will continue to serve in Yunnan, and Gan Jiehou will continue to serve in Guangdong. Luo Jiachong has been appointed to Hebei-Chahar, and Wu Zexiang has been appointed to Sichuan-Kangding. As for those who have been dismissed, including Cui Shijie, the inspector of the Shandong-Henan region, Xiao Encheng, the inspector of the Hunan-Hubei region, Cheng Jingyuan, the inspector of the Anhui-Jiangxi region, Lin Shaonan, the inspector of the Zhejiang-Fujian region, and Tao Jinzhi, the inspector of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Qinghai region, they will all be transferred to the Ministry to serve as commissioners for consultation.

(1st Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Lishangtun: Since the closure of the Dongzhuang breach, air-tightening projects such as advancing the bank and filling soil containers have been started immediately and are still proceeding day and night to speed up the progress. By the evening of the 31st, the bank had advanced more than 42 meters, and the soil container project was also advancing together with the bank at the same rate. Currently, there are still 17 meters left to connect with the bank. It is planned to advance a little further and then use sacks to lay a flat dam to align the soil containers, which can be sealed. It is also planned to build a circle dam outside the bank to strengthen it. At dawn on the morning of the 31st, Kong Xiangrong personally went to the proposed site of the circle dam to inspect it, and immediately designated the route and assigned a special commissioner to be responsible for supervising the construction. Construction began on the 1st and can be completed in two weeks. At 6:00 p.m., Director of General Affairs Wang Yutun and others took a boat to inspect the diversion canals and the breached dam.

<h3>Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Pass the "Regulations for Punishing Offenses Against National Currency"</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's Legal System and Finance Committees held a joint meeting on the 1st to examine the "Regulations for Punishing Offenses Against National Currency." Representatives from the Ministry of Finance attended to provide explanations. The result was a revised passage, submitted to the Yuan's meeting on the 3rd for discussion. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance considered that the existing "Temporary Regulations for Punishing Offenses Against National Currency" were stipulated before the implementation of the new monetary policy. There were no punitive provisions for the use or trading of silver coins, or for offenses against the Central Mint. Therefore, a revised draft was prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to the Central Political Committee for submission to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Yuan approved its assignment to the Finance and Criminal Law Committees, which held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 1st for examination. Committee members Di Fu and others attended, with Ma Yinchu as chairman. Dai Mingli, Director of the Minting Department of the Ministry of Finance, also attended. The result was a revised passage of the case, which was immediately submitted to the Yuan's meeting this week for deliberation. It is reported that the revised draft stipulates that those who use silver coins will be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than six months, detention, or a concurrent fine of not more than three times the face value of the coins. The same applies to those who collect or deliver coins to others with the intention of use, or transport them with the intention of profit. Those who buy or sell silver coins with the intention of profit, or those who commit offenses against the Central Mint, will be sentenced to imprisonment of not less than two years and not more than seven years, and may also be fined not more than three times the face value or price of the coins.

<h3>Dr. Trautmann States En Route Home That Germany Has No Intention of Taking Back Islands Under Japanese Mandate</h3>
<p>Far East Policy Centers on Maintaining Peace; Japanese-German Understanding Seems Increasingly Credible</p>
<p>(Singapore) German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, who is retiring and returning home, stated today while passing through here that German leader Hitler, while requesting the restoration of Germany's former colonies, does not hope to take back the Pacific islands currently under Japanese mandate. This does not mean that a German-Japanese agreement has been established. Germany's Far East policy centers on maintaining peace. The notion that a tacit understanding exists between China and Germany is also unreliable. Our technical assistance to China has been ongoing for a long time. (1st National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Locarno Four Powers' Proposal Rejected by German Response; Counterproposal Submitted to Organize European Peace Negotiations with a Four-Month Deadline; Troops Will Not Be Withdrawn from the Rhineland but Will Maintain the Status Quo; Advocate Holding a Pan-European Conference to Discuss Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The proposals put forward by the four Locarno signatory powers—Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy—to resolve the problems caused by the German military's reoccupation of the Rhineland have been entirely rejected by German leader Hitler. The German government, in a lengthy document carried to London by Hitler's special envoy, General Ribbentrop, declared that Germany could not accept the memorandum of the Locarno powers and reiterated its declaration that it would not withdraw its troops stationed in the Rhineland. However, it put forward several counterproposals, including the organization of Europe on the basis of peace, a conference on arms limitations, and a plebiscite to be held by France, Germany, and some other countries after the work outlined in the German memorandum is completed, to see if they agree with the work of their politicians. Germany agrees not to increase the troops stationed in the Rhineland during the negotiation period and proposes sending a joint commission to the area to monitor compliance. The commission will be composed of one representative each from Britain, Italy, and a neutral country. The German memorandum suggests: a truce for the newspapers of the countries concerned; France, Belgium, and Germany must not publish or publicly declare slanderous statements or educate their youth with them; a complete reorganization of the peace established by the Treaty of Versailles; a negotiation period of four months, with negotiations to begin either immediately or after the French general election; the League of Nations should be separated from the spirit of Versailles; and a reaffirmation of Hitler's hope to adjust the colonial issue within a reasonable period. It also suggests establishing an arbitration tribunal to monitor the faithful implementation of the finally agreed upon understandings and treaties.</p>
<p>The memorandum also stated regarding the suggestion to convene a conference on limiting armaments that such limitations are necessary not only for economic reasons but also for psychological reasons. The conference should decide: not to bomb cities and towns beyond 12 miles of the war zone; to abolish heavy artillery; to control gas warfare tactics; to ban heavy tanks; and to strictly adhere to the Geneva regulations regarding non-belligerent countries.

<p>(London) German leader Hitler's special envoy, General Ribbentrop, carrying Hitler's response to the memorandum of the four powers—Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy—flew from Berlin to Croydon Airport at 8:35 PM last night. He is scheduled to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden this morning. When asked whether he was carrying Hitler's final proposals, Ribbentrop did not give a definite answer, only stating that his visit to London was to present the German government's response to the four-power memorandum through the usual channels of diplomatic discussion. Hitler decided to send his special envoy to London without hesitation yesterday afternoon. A cabinet meeting was convened yesterday morning and continued into the afternoon. At that time, it was heard that the leader's response had not yet been drafted and would be presented through the usual diplomatic channels, rather than being carried to London by Ribbentrop. Later, it was learned that the response had been handed over to the special envoy to be sold to London. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) German representative Ribbentrop, accompanied by Mr. Dikofu, Director of the British Affairs Department of the German Foreign Ministry, visited Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax at 10:00 AM this morning and personally delivered the German government's memorandum on the draft agreement of the four Locarno powers. They left at 10:55 AM. The British Cabinet then held a meeting at 11:00 AM to discuss it. According to sources from this agency, German leader Hitler's proposal is to set a four-month transitional period, during which the current military situation on the borders of France, Belgium, and Germany should not be changed, and a neutral commission should monitor it. As for the construction of defensive fortifications, the German memorandum does not mention it. This memorandum is scheduled to be released simultaneously in London and Berlin at 6:00 PM today.

<h3>The British Translation of the German Memorandum Strives for Caution to Avoid Further Errors</h3>
<p>(London) The Cabinet met at 11:00 AM this morning to discuss the German memorandum and its possible impact on the original stance of the other signatories of the Locarno Treaty. The memorandum has not yet been translated into English. Foreign Secretary Eden reported on its contents in detail. The Cabinet adjourned at 1:00 PM. Once the translation is completed, a meeting will be held in the House of Commons this afternoon to continue the discussion. Translators are currently studying the original text closely to avoid errors. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The London correspondent of the Morning Post claimed that the German government's counterproposal to the Locarno Agreement was brought to London yesterday by German representative Ribbentrop. As of late last night, it had not yet been translated into English. The British Foreign Office, due to a misunderstanding caused by a single word difference in the translation of the response submitted by German leader Hitler on the 24th of last month, is striving for caution in the translation work to ensure that the English translation completely matches the original text. Ribbentrop himself will also review the English translation to ensure its accuracy. The newspaper also stated that German sources in London said that German leader Hitler originally intended to respond to the various questions raised by French Foreign Minister Flandin in his speech in Yonne province last week. The German Cabinet's discussion of the counterproposal was therefore delayed. Later, Hitler changed his mind, so the German response did not mention the questions asked by the French Foreign Minister. Furthermore, Mrs. Tabuyi, a diplomatic reporter for the Business Daily, claimed that the German government's counterproposal to the Locarno Agreement seems to allow the withdrawal of troops from the area bordering Belgium in the Rhineland region. This action has two purposes: to satisfy the British government to a considerable extent; and to alienate the relationship between France and Belgium. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Conditions for British Participation in Three-Nation Staff Talks</h3>
<p>Retaining Political Freedom; Cabinet Opinions Tend Towards Unanimity</p>
<p>(London) There have been rumors that Cabinet members have divergent opinions on foreign policy. The Liberal Party's organ, the Star, even published a headline in large characters: "Cabinet on the Verge of Dissolution," and stated, "Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, Sir John Simon, the Home Secretary, Lord Monsell, the First Lord of the Admiralty, and Mr. Brown, the Minister of Labour, are now clearly opposed to the staff talks between Britain, France, and Belgium." This news has been officially denied and it is stated that while Cabinet members previously held different views on the staff talks between the three countries, they are now in complete harmony. Conservative Party members also say that the staff talks between the three countries should not include political obligations. The technical measures to be taken by the three countries to ensure their own security should be freely chosen by each country without any constraints. Britain must participate in the talks on this condition, so the opinions of the Cabinet members have become unanimous. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Minister Without Portfolio Resigns</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Plaxy, Minister Without Portfolio, who has been in office since June 1935, has now resigned. This move does not affect the stability of the government. Lord Plaxy sent a letter to Prime Minister Baldwin, stating that he strongly supports the government's foreign policy. The position he held was not of a permanent nature, so he found it inconvenient to remain in office for the new fiscal year. Lord Plaxy is 49 years old and served as Minister of Education from 1924 to 1929. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Government Divides the Country into Ten Military Districts</h3>
<p>The Rhineland is also Included; Military District System Implemented Yesterday</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government has issued an order dividing the country, including the Rhineland, into ten military districts, and establishing military district headquarters in ten cities: Königsberg, Stettin, Berlin, Leipzig, Ulm, Münster, Aachen, Breslau, Kassel, and Altena. Each military district is further divided into conscription general directorates, military sub-districts, and conscription offices. The conscription general directorate under the jurisdiction of the Kassel military district headquarters includes seven locations: Kreuznach, Wiesbaden, Limburg, Anreheim, Francfort, Fuld, Darmstadt, and Offenbach. A total of four conscription general directorates are established in the Rhineland: the city of Karlsruhe, under the control of the Ulm military district headquarters; the city of Dortmund and the city of Düsseldorf, under the control of the Münster military district headquarters; and the city of Cologne. The entire province is divided into seventeen military sub-districts: Karlsruhe, Speyer, Ludwigshafen, Kaiserslautern, Zweibrücken, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Forstheim, Reishtatt, Phillibourg, Offenburg, Lahrach, Koyu, Bonn, Aachen, Yunlihe, and Düren. The last five sub-districts belong to the Cologne conscription general directorate. This military district system will be implemented starting tomorrow. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Philippines Implements Compulsory Military Training; Youth Must Register and Enroll by Deadline; Moro Tribes Rise Up in Opposition</h3>
<p>(Manila) The Philippine Islands will implement compulsory military training, an unprecedented event in Philippine history. Youth on all islands who are required to receive military training have begun registering and enrolling. According to regulations, they must register in the first week of this month and must not exceed the deadline. It is expected that the tribes will rise up in strong opposition, especially the non-Christian Moros. Yesterday in Lanao Province, several Moros clashed with 80 soldiers. Three Moros died and many were injured. This proves that the Moros will resist registration with violence. In yesterday's conflict, soldiers used machine guns and hand grenades to subdue the Moros.

<h3>Italian Financial Panic</h3>
<p>Increased Imports, Drastic Decline in Gold Reserves; Impact of Economic Sanctions Felt</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Bank held its shareholders' meeting today, where Director Asolini reported that as of October 10th last year, the Italian Bank's cash reserves were 4,025,000,000 lire, and foreign exchange reserves were 412,644,000 lire. By December 31st, cash reserves had decreased to 3,027,000,000 lire, and foreign exchange reserves had decreased to 367,000,000 lire. All of this was due to increased imports and the impact of sanctions. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian Bank issued a report today, from which the ambiguous financial position of Italy since October 1935 can be gleaned. Gold reserves at the end of December last year totaled £48,700,000. It is noted that when the bank stopped publishing its weekly reports, gold reserves were £63,400,000. £2,000,000 was shipped to Switzerland in January, and another £2,000,000 flowed out in February. In March, at least £4,000,000 was shipped abroad. Therefore, current gold reserves are no more than £40,000,000, or even less, because the public believes that Italy has shipped large amounts of cash to France, not only to meet commercial payment needs but also to maintain the exchange rate of the Italian currency. If the Italian Bank's gold reserves continue to flow out as much as in the last two months of 1935, the treasury will be empty within five or six months. Italians have already withdrawn many deposits abroad, which are now nearing depletion. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army in East Africa, telegraphed today that the Italian Army and Abyssinian forces engaged in a major battle near Lake Ashangi, defeating the Abyssinian King's elite troops. This was the first major battle personally attended by the Abyssinian King. The telegram did not mention the Italian Army's occupation of Gonda. However, according to non-official sources, the motorized column commanded by Fascist Party Secretary Stelaras has entered the town. The telegram also stated that the battle in the Lake Ashangi area lasted 12 hours, with 7,000 enemy soldiers killed, including many deputy chieftains. Italian white soldiers suffered 12 officers and 51 soldiers killed, and 44 officers and 152 soldiers wounded. Eritrean troops suffered a total of 800 killed and wounded. The Italian Army captured many enemy soldiers and seized a large number of weapons. A total of 20,000 Abyssinian soldiers participated in the battle, including well-equipped guards, who repeatedly attacked the Italian defense camp on the American and southern fronts from the front and sides. The Italian Army launched a counterattack, forcing the enemy to retreat in disarray to the Mekong Valley. Today, Italian planes bombed the Harar Abyssinian Army headquarters in Bura, which is located south of Dagabur. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Austria Restores Conscription; Reorganizes Military Within the Scope of the Treaty of Saint-Germain; Men Over 18 Must Enlist</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The House of Representatives unanimously passed the government's proposed labor and military service bill this morning. Article 1 of this bill stipulates that all men in the country between the ages of 18 and 42 who are physically and mentally sound may be ordered by the government to perform labor service or military service. The duration of service and remuneration will be determined by the government by order. Chancellor Schuschnigg delivered a speech to the House of Representatives, saying, "Austria is a factor for peace in Europe and is very willing to fulfill all treaty obligations. (The members cheered upon hearing this.) The bill passed by the House of Representatives aims to prevent internal and external enemies and to enrich national security. It is also an expression of the nation and people's free will." The members cheered wildly and dispersed singing the national anthem. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Austria has decided to reorganize its military within the limits of the treaty. The Federal Council held an important meeting today and passed a law allowing the recruitment of men aged 18 to 42 to serve in the military or perform labor service, with or without weapons, in the event of a national emergency. The plan for this decision was carefully formulated to avoid violating the Treaty of Saint-Germain. After the law was passed, Chancellor Schuschnigg rose to speak, strongly asserting Austria's right to take this step and appealing to the world to understand Austria's peaceful intentions. Germany took the same and more stringent steps last year, but Austria does not want to be compared to Germany or judged by the same standards as Germany. It is heard that this decision by the parliament was the result of a meeting between representatives from Italy, Hungary, and Austria in Rome. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Vienna) It is heard that Austria intends to actively re-equip its military within the scope permitted by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. This treaty was signed by Austria and the Allied powers in Saint-Germain on September 10, 1919. It stipulates the abolition of compulsory military service in Austria, limits the Austrian army to 30,000, and restricts its navy and air force. It also stipulates Austria's borders. Furthermore, Austria renounces all its rights in Egypt, Morocco, China, and the Dardanelles under this treaty. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The government recently submitted a bill to the Senate requesting permission to recruit citizens to engage in labor service or enlist in the military. The Senate is scheduled to discuss this bill tomorrow. Once it is passed, it will be included in the constitution. Regarding the content of this bill, the government has not released any information. However, according to general knowledge, the recruitment system proposed by the government is called the "Federal Compulsory Service System" and is not comparable to an ordinary conscription system. All citizens nationwide under the age of 42 may be recruited by the government to serve the country. There are two purposes: Austria's geographical situation makes it vulnerable to attacks by other countries. At a time when the international situation is precarious, it is necessary to make proper arrangements to cope with it. The (National Socialist Party's) propaganda for rebellion is very active and must be curbed so that Austrian citizens are not misled. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Warns Japan: Mongolian Border Conflict is Severe; Escalation Could Lead to Russo-Japanese War; Advocates Establishment of a Committee to Resolve Border Disputes</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today's conflict between Russian-Mongolian forces and Japanese-Manchukuo forces on the Mongolian border may worsen.  Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov today warned the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, stating that such conflicts could easily turn into a real and large-scale war between Russia and Japan. He also stated that the Soviet Union now has the obligation to protect Outer Mongolia, even resorting to force if necessary. Therefore, he demanded that Japan immediately cease its actions on the border, as the Soviet Union, for the sake of maintaining peace, cannot sit idly by and await further developments. (1st, Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Rumors circulated that Foreign Minister Litvinov had declared that Japan's provocative actions directly extinguished hope for peace. This report has been solemnly denied here. It is generally believed that repeated disputes along the Russian-"Manchukuo" border are regrettable, but it is hoped that the current difficulties between Japan and Russia can be resolved amicably, that relations between Russia and Japan can return to normal, and that the possibility of good neighborly relations between Russia and "Manchukuo" can still be established. As for the causes of the border disputes, the Soviet Union bears no responsibility. If the Japanese government is prepared to compromise, the Soviet Union will certainly reciprocate in good faith. (1st, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On March 31, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov conveyed to Japanese Ambassador Ota the Soviet government's response to the Japanese government's proposal on March 16 to establish a committee to redefine the eastern section of the border between Manchuria and the Soviet Union, and to establish a committee to resolve conflicts in that section.</p>
<p>Stomonyakov stated that the Soviet government believes that it is extremely important to achieve peace not only in the area from Lake Khanka to the Tumen River on the Soviet-Manchurian border, but also throughout the entire Soviet-Manchurian border. Ambassador Ota stated on March 27 that the Japanese government, in order to establish border peace, believes that a committee should be established as soon as possible to resolve disputes in the area from Lake Khanka to the Tumen River. The Soviet government believes that there is no reason to determine that the establishment of a committee to resolve disputes in various sections of the Soviet-Manchurian border will delay the establishment of a border committee in the section proposed by the Japanese government. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that in order to maintain peace, it is also extremely important to establish a border committee to resolve disputes on the Mongolian-Manchurian border.</p>
<p>Stomonyakov stated that the Soviet government has considered the Japanese government's remarks about negotiations between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, but still does not understand the Japanese government's expressed willingness to separate from these negotiations. Since the Japanese government felt it could propose to the Soviet government the establishment of such a committee between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union, the Soviet government believes that the Japanese government has no reason to reject the Soviet Union's offer of assistance in establishing the aforementioned committee on the border between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia in order to maintain peace. On the other hand, Japanese-Manchukuo troops have repeatedly attacked the Mongolian-Manchurian border in the past few days, regardless of the ongoing negotiations between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Therefore, in order to maintain peace, rapid solutions must be adopted, and passive waiting for developments is not an option.</p>
<p>On this point, Stomonyakov informed Ota that on March 29, a large number of Japanese-Manchukuo troops attacked a Mongolian border defense outpost 45 kilometers from the border at Artik-Dulun, but were forced to retreat due to a counterattack by Mongolian troops. On March 31, hundreds of Japanese soldiers, traveling in dozens of cargo trucks, under the cover of a cannon, several tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, attacked the aforementioned border defense outpost again and advanced towards Dammusik-Bulak. According to the latest information at the beginning of the conversation, Japanese-Manchukuo forces, facing resistance from Mongolian troops, were forced to retreat and are still fighting within Mongolian territory.</p>
<p>Stomonyakov asked Ota to pay attention to the serious nature of these incidents and pointed out that urgent and vigorous measures must be taken to immediately end the attacks on Outer Mongolia by Japanese-"Manchukuo" forces within Manchuria. Stomonyakov also pointed out that if the actions of Japanese government-affiliated agencies further expand and deepen the current conflict, the Japanese government will bear a heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>Ota promised to convey Stomonyakov's views to the Japanese government. At the same time, he repeatedly stated that the Japanese government does not oppose extending the jurisdiction of the border committee to the entire Soviet-Manchurian border, but only hopes to start with the eastern border between Manchuria and the Soviet Union in order to quickly establish peace. Ota continued to say that the Japanese government also does not oppose extending its March 16 proposal to the Manchurian-Mongolian border, but the Japanese government finds it difficult to negotiate this issue with the Soviet government because it does not yet know the exact relationship between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. Regarding the new conflict on the Mongolian-Manchurian border, Ota said that according to the information he received, the alleged attack was not initiated by the Japanese-Manchukuo side, but by the Mongolian side, and that this conflict was caused by unclear borders. Stomonyakov pointed out that the news about the Mongolian army attacking Manchurian territory is completely unreliable, as it is difficult for us to believe that Outer Mongolia could challenge Japan. At the same time, he could not agree with the view that the border is unclear, as on March 31, Japanese troops attempted to reach Dammusik-Bulak, which is located in Outer Mongolia, more than 45 kilometers from the border. Stomonyakov then asked the Japanese ambassador to note that the Soviet government, in order to protect its own interests and to maintain peace and the security of its borders, has repeatedly stated its views on maintaining peace on the Mongolian-Manchurian border in Tokyo and Moscow.</p>
<p>Stomonyakov continued that on February 21, he had informed Ota of the Soviet Union's responsibility to provide assistance if Outer Mongolia is attacked by a third party. This responsibility has existed since the 1921 agreement between the Soviet Union and the Mongolian government to mutually assist each other in jointly resisting enemy attacks. This oral responsibility was formally defined in the draft mutual assistance treaty signed in Kulun on March 13 this year. (1st, TASS Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mongolian-Manchukuo Forces Clash Again</h3>
<p>(Moscow) On March 31, a unit of Japanese-Manchukuo troops, traveling in dozens of cargo trucks, under the cover of tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, attacked the Mongolian border guard outpost at Artik-Dulun again, occupied the area, and advanced towards Dammusik-Bulak. Japanese-Manchukuo troops have approached Dammusik, 45 kilometers from the border inside Mongolian territory. However, Mongolian troops received reinforcements and fought hard, forcing the Japanese-Manchukuo troops to withdraw from Artik-Dulun. After reinforcement, the Japanese-Manchukuo troops attacked again. It is reported that they are currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat on the Mongolian border. (1st, TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters announced that a Japanese-Manchukuo patrol was bombed by Outer Mongolian aircraft at around 1:00 PM on the 29th. The Japanese side immediately dispatched a unit to the scene to investigate the truth. However, at 1:30 PM on the 31st, in the same area as before (northwest of Daulun, within Manchukuo territory), they encountered 12 Outer Mongolian aircraft bombing them, and the engagement lasted half an hour. Furthermore, at 3:00 PM that afternoon, they clashed with Outer Mongolian armored units. Both sides suffered casualties. (1st, Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>The Soviet-Outer Mongolian Mutual Assistance Treaty Has Significant Implications for the Current Situation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union has signed a mutual assistance treaty with Outer Mongolia, which will undoubtedly have an impact on the situation in the Far East, the general policy of the Soviet Union, and even the international situation. Moscow originally provided technical assistance to Kulun to resist the oppression of Japan and "Manchukuo" and protect its territory. After the establishment of the mutual assistance treaty, this technical assistance has been formally strengthened and can be implemented to the greatest extent in all forms. However, although the name of the treaty is mutual assistance, it is actually the Soviet Union assisting Outer Mongolia. The Soviet Union is now contiguous with Outer Mongolia, and it independently recognizes the government of Outer Mongolia, and has established a diplomatic representative in Kulun. It already enjoys superior power in Outer Mongolia's economy, especially in its diplomacy. Now, with the addition of the mutual assistance treaty, Outer Mongolia, which has always been a natural shield for the Soviet Union, can further establish a genuine protectorate and turn Outer Mongolia into a dependency. However, Outer Mongolia is still an integral part of Chinese territory. Its previous declaration of independence has not been recognized by China. China has protested to the League of Nations based on the League of Nations Covenant regarding similar events, such as "Manchukuo's" declaration of independence and the establishment of the Japan-"Manchukuo" Protocol with Japan. It will inevitably express its dissent regarding the Russo-Mongolian mutual assistance treaty. As for the international situation, for several years, the Soviet Union's policy towards Japan's outward expansion has been to delay. At this moment, it is establishing a mutual assistance treaty with Outer Mongolia, and its determination to confront Japan head-on can be seen. The Soviet Union is confident that it has sufficient strength to deal with all contingencies. Although Outer Mongolia is twelve days away from Moscow and has no railways built within its borders, the Soviet Union is still willing to accept a wide range of treaty obligations and has no fear. Germany's imperialistic threats against the Soviet Union and the countries that have signed mutual assistance treaties with the Soviet Union may try to distract the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union is not afraid.

<h3>The Sky Grand Hotel: The Structure and Contents of the Hindenburg</h3>
<p>Perfect Equipment Like Entering a Fantasy World; Special Attention Paid to Comfort and Safety; Can Fly Directly 8,000 Miles Without Refueling</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "Hindenburg" airship flew over the North Sea at noon today and headed towards the Bay of Biscay. The weather conditions en route were not good, but fortunately, the wind direction was favorable, so it did not adversely affect the speed of the voyage. (31st, Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A Reuters correspondent had the opportunity to inspect the interior of the world's largest airship, the Hindenburg. The Germans call this ship the "Sky Grand Hotel." It flew out of Friedrichshafen yesterday morning on its maiden voyage to South America. The impressions obtained by the correspondent are as follows: Stepping into the ship from an iron bridge is like entering a future fantasy world. The silver hull seems to represent the various forms of future events. There is almost no wood in the ship. Everything is made of the lightest metal. The walls are made entirely of balloon cloth and decorated in the latest style. All the chairs in the public areas are very comfortable and extremely light, and can be lifted with one hand. The shower rooms and bathtubs in each cabin are also made of ivory-like material. Passengers can smoke in the ship, which is not allowed on other airships. The smoking room is made of non-combustible asbestos. Passengers can only enter and exit through the airlocks managed by the crew. One cannot take a step out of the room unless the cigarette being smoked is placed in the water-filled ashtray. Dr. Eckener, the manager of the Zeppelin airship, told reporters that this new ship can be considered safe. All driving equipment is in duplicate. There are four engines in the ship, each with one thousand horsepower. Even if two engines fail at the same time, there are still two available for use. The smallest details of safety are taken care of. The entire ship has telephones for communication, but the line from the management room to the vicinity of the gas tank is replaced by a speaking tube, as the drivers do not want the risk of electric shock. The Hindenburg airship flies at 85 miles per hour and can travel from Europe to America in 60 hours. The return trip can be made in 40 hours if the wind is favorable. The Germans are confident that in the future, there will be twenty or thirty airships circling the world's continents, able to contact each other in a few hours. This ship has two decks, shower rooms, a bar, a smoking room, cabins for fifty passengers, and rooms for forty crew members. Its size can be imagined. The ship is 135 feet long, weighs 100 tons empty, and 200 tons loaded. The construction of this ship used a total of 5.5 million rivets, 83 miles of steel wire, and 65 miles of beams. Each Atlantic crossing requires 60 tons of heavy oil. The Germans hope that this ship will revolutionize air travel in terms of comfort and safety. Dr. Eckener spoke about the hope for the development of air travel, saying that this ship was originally intended for the South American route and will travel to the United States several times in the future to investigate how suitable the North Atlantic is for scheduled airline operations. However, these are just research and demonstration voyages. Some people think that North Atlantic airline operations can be as precise as clockwork, but I am not one of them, because the climate of the North Atlantic is more variable and dramatic than that of the South Atlantic. The arrival time of airships can be scheduled in South America, but whether traveling to North America by airship or other means, one cannot arrive on schedule. Therefore, I think the North American flight schedule should have a leeway of twelve hours, as one does not know what kind of climate one will encounter en route. (1st, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Sempill, a world authority on aeronautical engineering, said in a speech at the Royal Academy today that the German new airship Hindenburg will prove to the world that ocean air travel is entirely possible in practice. This ship has a speed of 80 knots per hour and can fly directly 8,000 miles without refueling. There have recently been negotiations on establishing air service between the UK on the European continent and the United States. Germany and France have now both established air service to South America. Their experiences will definitely help countries planning North Atlantic air service. However, the distances and climate of the North Atlantic are difficulties not encountered in South Atlantic air service. In the future, the design of airships will not only focus on sufficient fuel capacity but also on sufficient bedroom facilities. If the comfort of sea travel is to be transferred to air travel, then the form of airships does not seem to have strict limitations. (1st, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Lindbergh Kidnapping Case: Execution of Killer Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Execution Postponed for Forty-Eight Hours</p>
<p>Drieden, USA: Bruno Hauptmann, the German carpenter convicted of kidnapping and killing the infant son of famed aviator Colonel Lindbergh, has today received another 48-hour stay of execution from the electric chair, his second escape from death. Tonight, execution equipment in prison has been fully prepared. However, Warden Kimberling suddenly ordered a stay of execution minutes before it was to be carried out, because during the examination of sacked attorney Wintil in the local court in Mansell, it was claimed there had been special developments. Therefore, the Warden was requested to stay execution. Wintil previously confessed to having been involved in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, which he has since denied. Jurors at the Mansell local court were still considering the case up until 8:00 PM tonight. On hearing this news, Hauptmann’s defense attorney, Fisch, rushed to the prison to inform his client, who was reportedly very pleased. Security outside the prison today was very tight, with entry strictly forbidden without special accreditation. The basis for this stay of execution is a mystery at this moment, but private detective Packer, who has been critical of the conviction, was questioned twice, and each time Prosecutor Marshall was ordered to leave, suggesting there may be grounds for speculation. Hauptmann still maintains his innocence and has requested that he be allowed to broadcast on the radio, asking anyone with knowledge of the truth of the kidnapping case to come forward and confess. This request has been denied by prison authorities. (31st, Nationalist Telegram)</p>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey, USA: The execution of Bruno Hauptmann, the killer of Colonel Lindbergh's beloved son, was originally scheduled for 1:00 AM tomorrow. Hours before the scheduled execution, the Mercer County Court jury decided to postpone the execution for 48 hours at their request. This was prompted by the fact that the court, this afternoon, heard the case of Wintil, a suspect apprehended by the Burlington County Detective Agency. Following closing arguments, jurors carefully studied the testimony of Wintil for twelve hours, not yet completing the task. They decided to postpone the trial and demanded that Hauptmann’s execution be postponed for 48 hours. On leaving the courtroom, the Prosecutor declared that the investigation into the case was not yet complete. At the same time, Prison Officer Kimberling claimed at 8:05 PM, “The case has discovered new and interesting facts that jurors wish to continue to study.” Kimberling previously stated that if the jurors decided to indict Wintil, he would try to delay Hauptmann’s execution. He also explained that Hauptmann's execution was originally scheduled for the week of March 30 to April 6, so he had the right to extend the prisoner’s execution until the end of the week. When asked if he planned to execute the sentence on the evening of Thursday, when the court’s 48-hour extension expires, he said that he could not comment on that matter at this time. Governor Hoffman of the state also declared that the actions of Prison Officer Kimberling were completely voluntary and that he was unaware of them. (31st, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey, USA: The execution of Bruno Hauptmann, the kidnapper and killer of Lindbergh’s beloved son, is scheduled for 1:00 AM tomorrow (Greenwich Mean Time). Now that time is running out, the final preparations for the execution are underway. Hauptmann’s beard and hair have been shaved. Prison Officer Kimberling has just announced that Hauptmann’s attitude has been extremely stable throughout his lengthy imprisonment, but today he is dejected and sobbing, repeatedly saying that he is innocent.

<h3>Czech Citizen Elected to German Parliament</h3>
<p>Based on Existing Treaty, Czech Republic Protests to Germany</p>
<p>(Berlin) Among the deputies elected in the parliamentary election the other day were Jung, Krebs, and Hupe, who were originally Czech deputies. They had promoted National Socialism in the country and were wanted by the authorities. They all fled to Germany.

Therefore, it has instructed its ambassador, Masaryk, to visit Foreign Minister Bülow and formally protest to the German government. (31st, Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>After the Closing of the Zhuangdukou Breach, Post-Construction Work is Rushed</h3>
<p>The Linpu Official Embankment Can Be Completed in About Two Weeks, With Expenses Saving More Than One Million Yuan Compared to the Budget</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The breach in the Yellow River at Dongzhuang, Shandong, was closed on March 27th. Post-construction work is continuing day and night. According to dispatches from Dongzhuang, since the closure, the embankment body at the breach has continued to be raised with earth-filled sacks. After two days of effort, it has been leveled with the rest of the embankment and is passable for vehicles. A stone slope is being built in front of the breach. Although water is still seeping below the breach, the amount is very minimal and weak. Straw is being used to advance on the submerged area. The side embankment was originally 39.5 meters long, but for safety reasons, one end was extended by 10 meters, making it 59.5 meters long. The construction is proceeding very quickly, with only 7 or 8 meters remaining to be completed. After the side embankment is completed, earth dikes will be filled in (i.e., between the side embankment and the new embankment). Once filled, the area can be completely sealed. Based on the current work capacity, the side embankment and the earth dike project can be completed simultaneously by the evening of the 31st. After the closure, there is still a pool of accumulated water at the breach. It has now been decided to rush the construction of a surrounding dike to enclose the water (called a "water reservoir"). Once the water inside the surrounding dike is level with the water in the river, it should no longer flow outwards. Also, the Linpu Official Embankment has a total of six breaches over a length of five kilometers. Now that the Li Shengcun and Dongzhuang embankments are complete, the official embankment can also undergo simultaneous reconstruction work to close the breaches. Because these are dry breaches, the construction is easier. The larger ones can be completed in about two weeks. Also, the current breach, according to Kong Xiangrong's plan, will be raised to 63 meters above the sea level of Dagu. After consolidation, it can also reach 60 meters. According to historical records, the highest water level at Li Shengcun was 57.8 meters. Raising the embankment body to 60 meters will reduce future risks. Work has already begun. Also, the section from Songkou to Dongzhuang is currently being raised and thickened by the Yellow River Water Conservancy Association to ensure safety during this year's flood season. This section is 14.311 kilometers long. After completion, the planned top width is 10 meters and the slope is 1:3, estimated to require 120,000 cubic meters of earth. Work has been divided into sections and can be started in one week, to be completed in two months. Since the closure, three or four days have passed. The water in front of the Jinmen has cleared, and the shoals at the original main channel behind the Jinmen have emerged. Within ten days, dozens of counties in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu will be able to cultivate. The local residents near the breach, because the breach has been closed, have been staging plays and celebrations in the villages east of the breach for days, which is quite lively.</p>
<p>The original budget for the Dongzhuang breach closure was 2.67 million yuan, and the budget for the diversion canal project was 800,000 yuan, totaling 3.47 million yuan. After deducting the expenses of the Shandong Provincial Government's Breach Closure Project Committee for purchasing materials, etc., Kong Xiangrong, upon taking over the project, was approved to receive 2.53 million yuan according to the budget. He actually received 1.5 million yuan in government bonds converted into cash (3 million yuan in government bonds mortgaged at 50%). The Breach Closure Association transferred 300,000 yuan. Another 60,000 yuan, i.e., 300,000 yuan, was allocated as diversion canal expenses. He also received 300,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance, totaling 2.16 million yuan. There is still 430,000 yuan within the budget that has not been received. It is estimated that 210,000 yuan will be used for the diversion canal and over 1.3 million yuan will be used for the breach closure. The remaining 600,000 yuan, together with the 400,000 yuan that has not been received, totals over one million yuan in savings. In addition, there are still many materials remaining at the construction site, estimated to be worth 400,000 yuan. Therefore, it is estimated that the total savings for this breach closure is 1.45 million yuan. According to Kong Xiangrong's opinion, he intends to request the central government to approve the use of these funds for the post-construction work of the reconstruction of the embankment, and to allocate them as flood prevention funds for the province.

<h3>He Chengjunn Discusses Impressions of Inspecting Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>Changes in Folk Customs Compared to the Past; National Relief Urgently Needed</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjunn, Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, gave the following interview after returning from his inspection of northern Hubei:</p>
<p>"During this inspection of northern Hubei, I witnessed the situation of the people and had many thoughts. My ancestral home is in northern Hubei, and I know that the people there are traditionally honest and the local products are relatively abundant. However, what I saw this time was not as good as before. Firstly, the people are accustomed to laziness, and secondly, the people's thinking has changed. In the past, farmers in the countryside would always engage in some kind of sideline in their spare time. Men would collect firewood, and women would spin and weave, working hard all year round and not willing to rest. Now, the people in the countryside not only do not engage in sidelines, but they also treat their main occupations carelessly. Many places I passed through were barren. When asked the reason, they all said that no one was cultivating them. If this were in disaster areas or bandit areas, it would be understandable. However, even in safe areas, people are lazy to farm. This is a huge crisis. Last year, northern Hubei suffered a major flood, and production was even more drastically reduced. In the past month or two, because of the transition between seasons, the general ignorant people, trapped by their livelihood, are often incited by lurking bandits. There are many instances of people becoming bandits. Their children are accustomed to depravity, and even their fathers and elder brothers cannot stop them. Those who are more reasonable among the clansmen and villagers are unwilling to offend these people, fearing their revenge. The unscrupulous people then gather together and continue to do evil. Folk customs have reached this point, which is another huge crisis. When I passed through Suixian the other day, I saw an arrested bandit with a calm expression, saying to the onlookers, 'I am going to the county office for training, and I will be back in a month or two.' He did not consider being a bandit a disgrace. People's hearts have reached this point, which is frightening. The ancients said that even in a town of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people. Now, the loyal and trustworthy people are either hiding away or have moved to the cities. The commission previously organized a pacification committee to urge fair and upright gentry to return to their hometowns, but most of the gentry returned and then left again, leaving the countryside without a central figure to take charge. The change in people's thinking is also a major reason. The baojia system in various counties of northern Hubei is impressive in form, but it is difficult to say whether it is sound in substance. The so-called joint defense chiefs and baojia leaders, the upright people, are unwilling to do it. Because of this, the people are even more lazy, and people's hearts are even more corrupted. Some people believe that the bankruptcy of the countryside must be rescued by the state. However, even if the state provides relief to the general countryside, not only does the Chinese government not have the financial resources to do so, I fear that no government in any country has the financial resources to do so. Moreover, government handouts can only reach cunning and deceitful people. I fear that the ignorant villagers will not benefit from them. Confucius said to profit the people by what they benefit from. If the people have barren land and barren mountains, they should be ordered to plant them, and not let the benefits be abandoned on the land. Guanzi said, 'Only when the granaries are full can people know propriety and righteousness. Only when food and clothing are sufficient can people know honor and disgrace.' How can the granaries be filled, and how can food and clothing be sufficient? Only by supervising the people to be accustomed to diligence and frugality. If the people can all be accustomed to diligence and frugality, there will be no uncultivated land, no vagrants, and food and clothing will be sufficient. The granaries will naturally be filled, and the people will naturally know propriety and righteousness, and customs will naturally return to simplicity. Although this situation is only in a corner of northern Hubei, it is related to the entire country." (March 30th)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Side's Request to Send Troops for Anti-Communism; Actually Using the Pretext of Maintaining Peace in East Asia; Refused With "No Need for You to Overstep Your Authority"; The Current Situation Has Turned More Moderate</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: A week ago, during the tense military situation of suppressing bandits in Shanxi, there were many rumors about diplomatic issues in Hebei and Chahar. The details of what happened have only recently been publicly revealed. The authorities here are currently in Tianjin, trying their best to eliminate hidden dangers. Future developments may take some time.</p>
<p>The Japanese people have a particularly strong feeling about the communist disaster in Shanxi. Generally speaking, the discussions among the Japanese people can be divided into two groups. One group belongs to diplomatic personnel. There have been quite a few people who have recently gone to Shanxi to investigate. After returning, they all believe that the military suppression of bandits in Shanxi is very intense, but they are deeply worried that it will not be easy to eliminate in the short term. The other group consists of military personnel, whose arguments are almost identical. They all rely on the news from communication channels run by people from their country, exaggerating the situation as much as possible. They even use the news reported by a certain French newspaper published in Shanghai to maliciously criticize our authorities,</p>
<p>The so-called criticism refers to falsely accusing the Chinese government of "allying with Russia" and "tolerating communists," and claiming that, in order to maintain so-called "peace in East Asia" and protect so-called "interests in North China," their country is willing to use its strength to help the Hebei and Chahar authorities engage in anti-communist work. If necessary, they can even take on the responsibility of suppression. For this reason, a week ago, there was a rumor here that Japan would send a large number of troops to be stationed in Tianjin and Tongzhou. At the same time, it was also rumored in Tianjin that the Japanese military had already rented houses in Tianjin for the use of increased troop deployment. With the wind howling and the cranes crying [state of alarm], people's hearts were clearly uneasy.</p>
<p>At that time, Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei and Chahar Political Affairs Committee, was in Baoding examining county magistrates and taking care of Hebei province. After receiving intelligence that the Japanese side was preparing to increase troops, he immediately summoned Qin Dechun, the mayor of Beiping, to Baoding to discuss how to deal with the situation. The two then went to Tianjin together to wait for a meeting with Arita, the Japanese ambassador to China, and to explain the situation to the important staff of the Japanese military in Tianjin. Furthermore, they formally expressed on behalf of Song Zheyuan that the anti-communist measures in Hebei and Chahar provinces and in the cities of Beiping and Tianjin were very thorough, and that the anti-communist deployment at the border between Hebei and Chahar and Shanxi was sufficient to cope with the situation, and there was no need for the Japanese side to overstep their authority. As a result, the situation was relatively satisfactory, and the talk of the Japanese military increasing troops seemed to subside.</p>
<p>However, before Song Zheyuan went to Tianjin, Imaii Takeo, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, had paid a visit to Song on the 29th to inquire about something. The content of the conversation, as reported by the Japanese newspaper Keihin Nichinichi Shimbun, had deep meaning. Because it was an exchange of opinions, there was no concrete discussion. Song is currently in Tianjin, holding routine gatherings with the new staff of the Japanese military in Tianjin, including the military attaché Matsumuro Takayoshi and Commander Tada Shun, taking the opportunity to exchange opinions with them in a personal capacity. Qin Dechun, the mayor of Beiping, as well as Shi Jingting, a member of the Political Affairs Committee, and Pan Yugui, Director of Political Affairs, were also summoned to Tianjin on the 30th to assist in everything. As of now, the serious situation in Hebei and Chahar diplomacy has turned more moderate, but the future is not easy to be optimistic about. The excuses made by the Japanese side are often far from ideal. According to people in diplomatic circles, the new military attaché of the Japanese military in Tianjin, Matsumuro Takayoshi, served as an advisor to Feng Yuxiang during the National Army era. He is quite familiar with Song Zheyuan and the former core members of the National Army. Matsumuro's arrival in China to be responsible for negotiations by the Japanese military in Tianjin means that both sides have a deeper understanding than usual. Therefore, it is hoped that everything in the future will make good progress on an equal footing compared to the past. It is heard that Matsumuro is scheduled to come to Beiping from Tianjin on April 6th to formally conduct official business. The name of the organization is the Tianjin Japanese Military Representative Office in Beiping, and the contents are divided into four sections, which are being prepared by the responsible personnel and will be completed within days.

<h3>Record of the Public Trial of the Wang Case (2) Day One: Trial of the Three Accused, Zhang, He, and Liu; They Admit to Conspiracy to Assassinate but Still Try to Evade Responsibility</h3>
<p>Originally Advocated Using Bombs</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge further stated, "When you were in the Central Hospital, the prosecutor asked you if assassination was not your original intention, and you said you originally advocated using bombs to warn them (referring to Chiang Kai-shek, Wang Jingwei, and other central authorities). Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen wanted to compete for political territory and believed that assassinating Chairman Chiang and President Wang was necessary to achieve their goals. That's why they asked you to organize the Chenguang Society. Why are you denying it now?" Zhang expressed resentment, saying, "This is a slight deviation, a thousand miles away." The Presiding Judge refuted, "There is a record to prove this, and you have seen and signed this record. How can you deny it?" Defendant Zhang continued to evade responsibility, saying, "I definitely did not say this. Maybe I was not conscious or did not pay attention when I saw the record." The Presiding Judge refuted again, "You also described this in detail in your confession," and presented the confession. Defendant Zhang said, "This confession is not credible, please pay attention to the other two confessions." The Presiding Judge, after cautioning Defendant Zhang for his dishonesty, continued the interrogation.</p>
<p>Yu Likui Once Assassinated a Song</p>
<p>"Who is Yu Likui? Wang Yaqiao's friend. You once confessed that Yu Likui was an important figure in the assassination of Song Ziwen, is that right?" "He has nothing to do with this case." "How many people under Wang Yaqiao were responsible for assassinations?" "I don't know." "Do you know Hu Dahai, Zhou Xiping, and Zhang Zhihan?" "I don't know them." "Your previous confessions are different. You confessed in detail about Yu Likui at the police station, do you remember?" "I don't remember." At this point, the Presiding Judge presented the transcript, but Zhang denied everything. "Have you ever seen Yu Likui?" "I saw him once. He was once a regimental commander in the 19th Route Army. As for whether he assassinated Song, I really don't know." "Why did you want to assassinate Chairman Chiang and President Wang? Were you Communists, or were you instructed by Chen and Li, or did you have other ideologies?" "This was done by Sun Fengming because he was dissatisfied with Chairman Chiang and President Wang."</p>
<p>Once Joined the Communist Party</p>
<p>"You used to be a member of the Communist Party, right?" "I joined in the 20th year of the Republic, but I left in the 23rd year after reading more books." "What does the National Revolutionary Great Alliance mean?" "What I wrote in my confession is just hearsay." "According to you, you have nothing to do with this case at all?" "That's not true." "Then, tell me, what is your involvement?" "I helped out in the Chenguang Society, such as helping to move houses and writing stencils. I knew about Sun Fengming's assassination, and I sympathize with him. I don't deny this. Other than that, I have no other involvement." "What side is Sun Fengming on? When did you meet him?" "He is Wang Yaqiao's man. I have known him for two or three years. Wang introduced him. Sometimes he came alone, and sometimes Hua Kezhi accompanied him." "When was the last time you left Nanjing?" "A few days before the Sixth Plenary Session closed." "On October 28th, you held a secret meeting. What did you say when you encouraged Sun Fengming?" "This was not a meeting, just a casual chat among everyone. All the defendants today, except Lu Qinglin, were present during the conversation."</p>
<p>Sun Wanted to Assassinate During the Conversation</p>
<p>"The purpose of your conversation was to discuss the assassination, wasn't it?" "The conversation had no target. However, Sun Fengming expressed his intention to assassinate, and everyone agreed. I said at the time that this matter was of considerable significance." "Who was the target of the assassination?" "First was Chairman Chiang, and second was President Wang. If they couldn't achieve their goal, they would just fire a few shots as a warning. This was Sun Fengming's idea, not mine. Because if Sun Fengming didn't want to assassinate, and I asked him to go, then it would be considered my idea. But the fact is not like that." "You once confessed that the instigators of the assassination were Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, etc. The masterminds were Hua Kezhi, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, etc. Those who knew about it were Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, Lu Qinglin, etc. Why are you denying it now?" "The specific facts are just the few words I said just now." "Where did the pistol come from?" "I don't know. I only saw it in the society, in a small box. This was four or five days before the Sixth Plenary Session." "Was this pistol later placed in Lu Qinglin's house?" "I don't know." "You said that the pistol was only for dealing with one or two people, and you advocated using bombs, didn't you?" "I didn't say that."</p>
<p>Left Beijing Because Sun Was Going to Assassinate</p>
<p>"When did you leave Beijing?" "The night before the Sixth Plenary Session, one or two days before." "Was it because Sun Fengming was going to assassinate, so you left first?" "Yes." "Who sent Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters?" "He Poguang." "How many times did you conspire to assassinate?" "Three times. The first time was during the Fifth Plenary Session, targeting Chairman Chiang. The second time was when President Wang resigned and Chairman Chiang returned to Beijing, still targeting Chairman Chiang. The third time was when this case happened. Sun Fengming was in charge all three times." "Why did the previous two attempts fail?" "The first time failed, according to Sun Fengming, he became very nervous when he saw Chairman Chiang. By the time he wanted to act, Chairman Chiang had already gotten into the car. The second time was because he didn't see Chairman Chiang. I knew about both of these attempts." "After the second failure, you looked for Guo Weizhong (phonetic transcription), and you were the one who went to find him, right?" "I originally wanted to go to De'an, Jiangxi, to find Mo Xiong for business. Coincidentally, Wang Yaqiao sent a letter asking me to bring Guo Weizhong and Sun Fengming to Hong Kong. So I went to find him on the way. After I brought them to Hong Kong, Sun Fengming volunteered and insisted on assassinating, so I didn't replace him with Guo Weizhong." "Who is the mastermind behind your assassination?" "In the beginning, it was Wang Yaqiao. Who Wang represents, I don't know. I only know that Wang's finances were supplied by Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen. As for whether Chen and Li were the instigators, I don't know."</p>
<p>Communication Methods During the Assassination</p>
<p>"During your assassination, you used rental slips to indicate whether the action had been taken. The first time was by Guo Zhianfeng (phonetic transcription), and the second time was by Lu Qinglin, wasn't it?" "I don't remember clearly." "Sun Fengming was originally supposed to be sent to the Central Party Headquarters by you. Why was it changed to He Poguang sending him?" "Because He Poguang was in Zhenjiang, it was easy to escape, and he was more familiar with the Central Party Headquarters." "When did you meet He Poguang? What did he do in the Chenguang Society?" "I met him three years ago in Shanghai, and he was responsible for interviewing. He didn't participate in this case, but he also conspired." "What did he say to Sun Fengming during the meeting?" "About the same as what I said."</p>
<p>Confession of Relationships with the Accused</p>
<p>At this point, the defendant Zhang continued to confess to the various sections questioned by the Presiding Judge, saying that He had not been to Hong Kong. He's fiancée is called Huang Wengui, Sun Fengming's wife is called Cui Jingyao, and his sister-in-law is called Cui Jingqi, and they all know about this. Liu Shurong is my fellow villager. During the meeting, he did not express any opinions. I know Li Huaicheng, but he has no business in the society, he just comes to play often, and he also knows about this. I don't remember what was said in the conversation meeting. Xiang Zhonglin is my friend, he lives in the society, but has no position. He was also at the conversation meeting, but I don't remember what he said. He is very good with Hua Kezhi, and Hua asked him to come. I don't know if he asked someone to obtain an entry and exit permit for the Central Party Headquarters. I know Lu Qinglin. He has no position in the society. He also knows about the assassination. He was not at the meeting. I don't know who brought the pistol and placed it in his house. I went to his house before the incident and gave him fifty yuan, but it was just lending it to him, not giving him travel expenses for escape.</p>
<p>Denies Being a Key Offender in This Case</p>
<p>I have not been to Fujian. It is true that Hua Kezhi and I are good friends, and it is also true that I am involved in this case, but it cannot be said that I have the most important relationship. I joined the Communist Party Association and served as a district committee member, thinking it was an organization for studying social science. There was no certificate when I joined, and there was no certificate when I quit. I don't know if He Poguang has joined the Communist Party Labor Union. The reason for this assassination is dissatisfaction with Chairman Chiang and President Wang. This may be because I don't have a clear understanding of politics, but 99% of this matter was initiated by Sun Fengming. After the incident, 860 yuan was brought from Hong Kong, brought by Cui Jingyao handed over by Hua Kezhi. At this point, the Presiding Judge considered the interrogation to be over. Although Defendant Zhang denied one or two important points, the facts of the case have been clarified. Then He Poguang was summoned for interrogation. The time was 4:15 PM.</p>
<p>Defendant He Was Even More Cunning, Shifting Responsibility in Every Possible Way</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge also gave Defendant He a faithful warning first, instructing him to confess honestly. However, Defendant He was even more cunning than Defendant Zhang, shifting responsibility in every possible way. But the truth of the matter is extremely obvious, and it can be said that it was all in vain. The main points of the Presiding Judge's questions and answers with Defendant He are as follows:</p>
<p>"When did you meet Zhang Yuhua?" "After the 23rd year of the Republic." "Where did you meet Liu Shurong?" "At the Nanyang Hotel in Nanjing." "How did you meet Li Huaicheng?" "I was introduced to him by Shan Xie Gengsheng (phonetic transcription) in Shanghai in March of the 13th year of the Republic." "Do you know Wang Yaqiao and Hua Kezhi?" "I have never seen Wang. I met Hua at Zhang Yuhua's place in September of the 23rd year of the Republic." "Do you know the background of the Chenguang Society?" "At first, I thought it was a purely news organization. Zhang recommended me to be a reporter. A week after it opened, Zhang Yuhua talked to me about Hua Kezhi's friend, Sun Fengming's intention. That's when I found out. Before the first implementation, I was sick in the Central Hospital. Zhang Yuhua and Liu Shurong came to see me. Zhang told me that Sun was going to assassinate." "You wrote a confession, do you remember?" "I don't remember all of it." The Presiding Judge then presented the confession. He admitted that he had written it, but he wrote it as a result of inner reflection. "You wanted to assassinate, did you want to disrupt public order?" "I didn't want to disrupt the central government. I only knew about the assassination after Zhang Yuhua talked to me." "According to you, you didn't know anything about it at all?" "I didn't participate in the plan. Zhang Yuhua just told me that he was going to assassinate Chairman Chiang." "Do you know the source of funding for the Chenguang Society?" "According to Zhang Yuhua, it was Hua Kezhi's activity. I asked him where Hua got it. He said that Hua had a very good relationship with Chen Mingbian and Li Jishen, so it was supplied by Chen and Li." "How much did you get in total?" "I don't know." "Who is in charge of the Chenguang Society?" "I was in charge of interviewing. Zhang asked me to go. The one who came forward was Hu Yunqing, who is Hua Kezhi." "Why did Hua Kezhi use a pseudonym?" "I only knew that he used a pseudonym after the manuscript was published. I asked him the intention of using a pseudonym. He told me that he was dissatisfied with the authorities and wanted to make demands on them." "How to make demands?" "I don't know."</p>
<p>Initially Targeted Chairman Chiang for Assassination</p>
<p>At this point, the Presiding Judge rebuked him for being too cunning. He then began to say that he only knew that Sun had the intention to assassinate at the society after he left the hospital. The first plan was to target Chairman Chiang, and the second time was also to target Chairman Chiang. The third time they told me that if Chairman Chiang could not be assassinated, then President Wang would be assassinated. "What did you talk about at the meeting on October 28th?" "This was not a meeting, just a casual chat after dinner. Hua Kezhi said that he hoped Sun Fengming would go to assassinate, and Sun was also very angry and expressed his determination to do it. I just said that this matter was very meaningful, and I did not encourage it."</p>
<p>He Obtained the Entry and Exit Permit</p>
<p>"Did you go to get the entry and exit permit on October 30th?" "Yes, because Xiang Zhonglin didn't get it." "Did you send Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters?" "I didn't send him in. I just got the badge and gave it to him." "Have you seen this pistol?" "I saw it at the Military Police Headquarters." "Didn't you see it at the Chenguang Society?" "I also saw it coming. I don't know where it came from. You once confessed that the meeting was to assign work to everyone. You also confessed that Hua Kezhi told you that the target of the assassination was first Chairman Chiang and second President Wang. The reason was that Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen lost the Minbian Rebellion, so they asked Hua Kezhi to organize the Chenguang Society. They wanted to assassinate government officials to cause a major political disturbance so that they could restore their political position. You also confessed that Chen and Li used you, and you also used Chen and Li to help the Red Army and relieve the current difficulties, is that right?" "I didn't say that."</p>
<p>Actually Denied the Confession Book</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge then presented his confession book, which had red lines, and said that this blue-lined one was wrong. The Presiding Judge refuted it, saying that the red-lined one was from the High Court, and the blue-lined one was from the Capital District Court. The question now is based on the District Court. He still said that the District Court's book also had red lines. The Presiding Judge said that He had signed in the confession book, so such sophistry was wrong, and he rebuked him. Regarding sending Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters, Defendant He confessed that on the day of the incident, he went to the Central Party Headquarters twice. The first time was too early, and he didn't get the entry and exit permit. The second time, he got the entry and exit permit at about 8:25 and handed it over to Sun Fengming at the tea house next to the Minsheng Hotel, and then went to Hepingmen to take the train.</p>
<p>Feared Inspection and Fled to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Presiding Judge then asked, "You once confessed that you took the train and originally wanted to go to Shanghai, but you went to Zhenjiang first because you were afraid of inspection. Why were you afraid? If this matter had nothing to do with you, why were you afraid of inspection?" Defendant He could not deny this. He then answered that he knew about this matter, but still denied being involved in it. Then he confessed that he joined the Communist Party Education Association in April of the 23rd year of the Republic and did not hold any position, thinking it was a reading club and not knowing it was a Communist Party organization. He went to Hong Kong in early February of the 23rd year of the Republic, originally introduced by a friend Xie Fengsheng (phonetic transcription) to work in the 19th Route Army, but when he arrived in Fujian, the 19th Route Army had already failed, so he went to Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai. He met Xiang Zhonglin in Fujian. He already knew Liu Shurong. He had the same position as me in the Chenguang Society. Li Huaicheng had no position in the society. Xiang Zhonglin was called by Zhang Yuhua in April or May of the 24th year of the Republic to ask for subsidies from government agencies. I did not encourage or tell Sun Fengming to kill at the meeting, but I agreed with him, so I did not report it. I ate in the society, how much money did I spend in total? I didn't keep statistics.</p>
<p>Said He Knew Nothing About the Assassination of Song</p>
<p>I don't know about Song Ziwen's assassination in Shanghai. I don't know Wang Yaqiao and Yu Likui either. I don't know where the pistol was hidden. There were three assassinations of Chairman Chiang in total. I don't know why they failed. Zhang Yuhua told me about the secret communication method after I got on the train. The reason why I wanted to go to Shanghai was because I knew the incident had happened. After I fled to Zhenjiang, because the news was tight, my sister-in-law accompanied me to the countryside. I don't know about the money sent from Hong Kong after the incident. Zhang Yuhua gave me sixty yuan when I left. I have been to Lu Qinglin's house twice before. At this point, the Presiding Judge summoned Liu Shurong for questioning. The time was 5:25 PM.</p>
<p>Liu Shurong Was More Straightforward; Did Not Speak at the Secret Meeting</p>
<p>Defendant Liu's confession was more straightforward than the confessions of Zhang and He. He said that Zhang Yuhua was a childhood classmate. Zhang asked me to come to Nanjing to play. I interviewed at the Chenguang Society. A week after the manuscript was published, Zhang Yuhua told me the intention of organizing the Chenguang Society, saying that Sun Fengming wanted to assassinate Chairman Chiang. At that time, Sun was not in the society, and I did not express any opinions. The Presiding Judge then asked, "Since you knew he wanted to assassinate Chairman Chiang, not to mention that Chairman Chiang is the leader of our country, killing an ordinary person is also a crime. Since you knew about it and didn't report it, what was your intention?" Defendant Liu confessed that Zhang Yuhua told me this secret news, and I couldn't leave. And I also resigned from my job at the Party Headquarters. Their plan was only told to me after the fact. As for the purpose of the assassination, they refused to tell me. They always gave me money for every move and asked me to go to Shanghai first. I only knew about two assassinations. The first time was during the Fifth Plenary Session, and the second time was when this case happened. Sun Fengming was brought by Hua Kezhi. I never spoke at the meeting on October 28th because I usually have no opinions on national affairs. I don't know who the mastermind behind the assassination is. I knew about this and agreed with it, but the assassination was Sun's action. I went to Shanghai on the 30th. The pistol was brought by Hua Kezhi from Shanghai and placed in the box in the Chenguang Society. I saw it. Guo Zhifeng fired a shot to try it out. Xiang Zhongshuang lives in the society. He was asked to raise funds. Li Huaicheng often came to the society to play. I spent more than 100 yuan in the society. Zhang Yuhua and He Poguang's opinions were the same as mine, etc. The time was already 5:50 PM. The Presiding Judge announced that the interrogation would not be completed today and that the trial would continue at 1:00 PM on the (31st). Today's records will be read out tomorrow after they have been sorted out. Then he ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the court (Central News Agency).</p>
<h3>Changshu: Careless Coal and Oil Warehouse</h3>
<p>Sun Gongxing Coal Company in this county has been open for many years and its business is quite prosperous. It has a warehouse at the entrance of Wuyi Alley, which also stores kerosene. The warehouse is usually closed except for loading and unloading goods. Unexpectedly, for some unknown reason on the evening of the 31st, the warehouse suddenly caught fire. Because the warehouse contained flammable goods, it took about an hour to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that more than 30 drums of kerosene and about 20 tons of coal were burned, with losses of about 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Manager of Foreign Cloth Company Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Zhentang Town, District 8, Tongtai Hengshun Foreign Goods and Cloth Company. Last year, the manager of the company, Zhu Yongbo, and the business director, Wei Hanying, colluded with each other to embezzle funds. After detailed investigation by the on-the-job shareholder Cheng Zhenyang, more than 200 yuan has been discovered, and there are still many that have not been verified. Therefore, Cheng Zhenyang, in the name of the legal representative of Tongtai Hengshun Company, entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the manager and business director of the company for breach of trust and embezzlement. After the court received the complaint, it has held two court sessions. The first court session was rescheduled because the defendants did not appear in court. The second court session was held on the afternoon of March 28th. The defendant Zhu Yongbo also personally surrendered himself to the court. After the judge in charge of the trial questioned both parties in detail and examined the evidence and the testimonies of both parties, and after the lawyers of both parties argued, he ordered the debate on the case to be concluded and set the date for sentencing on the 30th. The defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Side Issues Occur in Teacher-Student Love Affair Case</h3>
<p>The case of Lu Qiangfen, a resident of Shitangwan, and Chen Lin, a resident of Shanghai, a teacher-student love affair that caused a sensation for a time, was once publicly tried by the Criminal Court. Now, the plaintiff Sun Zhonghao has divorced Lu Qiangfen and has withdrawn the lawsuit against Chen and Lu from the court. However, when the withdrawal of the lawsuit against the two was submitted, another statement was suddenly added, still requesting that Chen Lin be dealt with, which caused another dispute. Yesterday was the court date for this case. Judge Liu presided over the trial in the first special court. Sun Zhonghao retained lawyer Sun Zhanqi to defend him, and Chen Lin retained Tang Ying to defend him. First, Sun Zhonghao testified, stating that Chen Lin should be severely punished because the case concerns morality. He also claimed that the withdrawal of the lawsuit against Chen and Lu was due to the concealment of lawyer Sun Xicheng, and he pointed out that lawyer Sun Xicheng was acquainted with the presiding judge. After Sun Xicheng was summoned to court for questioning, Chen Lin was summoned to testify. He completely denied the part of the accusation of adultery, claiming that Sun and Lu's husband and wife had disagreements and that he was a scapegoat. Then Chen Lin's defense lawyer stood up to defend him, requesting a declaration of innocence. Sun Zhonghao's defense lawyer also stood up and stated that he was requesting compensation for incidental civil litigation of 1,000 yuan. At this point, the court ordered the debate on the case to be concluded and set the date for sentencing at 10:00 AM on the 4th. Sun Xicheng and Sun Zhonghao were transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation, Chen Lin was remanded in custody, and Lu Qiangfen was ordered to return home.</p>

He announced the conclusion of the debate on the 24th of last month. Yesterday was the date for sentencing. The imprisoned Zhou Gu and Zhou Xingdi were brought forward. Judge Liu opened the court and briefly questioned their ages and origins and then immediately sentenced Zhou Gu to seven years of imprisonment for the crime of inciting murder, and Zhou Xingdi to ten years of imprisonment for the crime of murder. Zhou Gu and her daughter expressed their dissatisfaction in court and requested to file an appeal. After Judge Liu checked the words, he ordered the bailiffs to take them back to custody.

<h3>Five National Medicine Organizations Host National Medicine Exhibition, Opens Yesterday, Featuring Over 1,400 Varieties of Medicines</h3>
<p>The National Medicine Exhibition, hosted by five organizations: the Municipal National Medicine Association, the Medicinal Materials Association, the National Medicine Merchants Association, the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Association, and the Municipal Plant Association, opened yesterday at 2:00 PM at 572 Bazilu Road, the location of the National Medicine Association. Attendees included Lu Hailan from the Municipal Bureau of Education, Qin Bowei, Zhang Zanchen, and Chen Cunren from the National Foundation Association, Dong Bowei, Chen Wenming, and Fei Tinghua from the Medicinal Materials Association, Shen Hefu, Gao Ziwen, and Cen Zhiliang from the National Medicine Merchants Association, Yao Changqing, Cui Qifeng, and Jiang Rulin from the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Association, Jiang Xiyi from the Plant Association, and over 200 guests from various sectors. Ding Zhongying, Fei Zhonghua, Gao Ziwen, Jiang Xiyi, and Zhu Bingle were elected as the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Following the customary opening ceremony, Chairman Ding Zhongying delivered a report, stating, "In ancient times, sages developed medicine to alleviate premature death. Our nation's history of medicine is long. For all conditions of cold, heat, dryness, dampness, internal injury, external infection, and for what can be supplemented, attacked, purged, emeticized, harmonized, or induced to sweat, there are specific medicines to treat the ailments. When used appropriately, the response is immediate. However, our national medicines number in the thousands, each differing in origin and efficacy. Not only are ordinary people largely unaware, but even famous physicians often rely on medical books without truly understanding the true nature of the medicines. Moreover, many pharmacies on the market are not meticulous in their practices, sometimes prioritizing cheapness over quality, or even substituting genuine products with fakes, deceiving customers and causing great harm. It is no wonder that those who are infatuated with Westernization use this as an excuse to criticize our national medicine. Now, to provide the public with basic knowledge and to aid physicians in their research, we have initiated this exhibition of medicinal materials. Our association has requested various authentic medicines from our members, specifying the origin of each item, along with its properties and functions. This will allow physicians to conduct research, and the general public can also gain knowledge, recognizing the shape of each medicine and avoiding harm due to the inadvertent negligence of unscrupulous merchants or blind adherence. Although this exhibition may not be exhaustive, a significant number of medicines are on display. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will actively visit and learn that our national medicines not only have a long history but also possess the miraculous power to cure diseases, prolong life, and bring the dead back to life. The accuracy of these medicines cannot be measured by distance alone. We also hope that all merchants will uphold ethical principles, follow the correct path, refrain from selling counterfeit goods, avoid misleading patients, and refrain from being greedy for small profits that lead to big mistakes. By doing so, we can bring health and longevity to the people and enhance the glory of our nation, which will greatly benefit from it."</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>Next, Jiang Xiyi reported on the preparation process, stating that the five medical organizations initiated the preparation for the exhibition in early March to enable citizens to understand national medicine. After seven meetings, it was decided that the Medicinal Materials, National Medicine Merchants, and Ginseng and Bird's Nest Associations would collect and review the exhibits. A total of over 1,400 items were collected, and the exhibition is opening here today, with the names, properties, origins, and uses of the items clearly labeled for easy understanding by visitors. The exhibition will last for one month, with subsequent exhibitions to be held at the Botanical Garden and the Medicinal Materials Association. Next, Lu Hailan from the Bureau of Education and Xie Liheng gave speeches, followed by a response from Fei Tinghua. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. From yesterday to the 9th, the exhibition will be held at the National Medicine Association. From the 11th to the 19th, it will be held at the Municipal Botanical Garden. From the 21st to the 29th, it will be held at the Medicinal Materials Market.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Commodity Inspection Opens Silk Merchants Meeting Yesterday, Discussing Improvement of Exported Raw Silk, Two Principles Decided</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry, in order to improve the export of raw silk according to orders and to solicit opinions on foreign sales, specially convened silk merchants from various places at 3:00 PM yesterday in the reception room of the bureau to hold a meeting. Attendees included Cai Wuji, Director of the Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection, Miao Zhongxiu, Director of the Silk Inspection Group, Miao Yuhui from the Bureau of Commodity Inspection, Hu Weijin, a silk merchant from Sichuan, Che Zisheng, a silk merchant from Shandong, Xue Shouxuan and Zhang Jifang, silk merchants from Wuxi, Chu Huiseng and Jiang Laixian, silk merchants from Zhejiang, Li Shuchu from the Zhejiang Silk Promotion Office, and Zhu Huian and Huang Jiyuan from Shanghai silk factories, among others, totaling over ten people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the customary opening ceremony, Chairman Cai Wuji delivered a report, stating that the sluggishness of Chinese silk exports in recent years indicates that survival requires unity. The United Silk Factory Committee has been organized in Zhejiang, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places to handle unified production matters to seek a solution. However, the Ministry of Industry has occasionally discovered substandard Chinese silk in the foreign sales market, which has a significant impact. Therefore, concrete methods must be devised internally and externally to improve the situation. He specially convened the meeting to solicit opinions from everyone and discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Principles Decided</p>
<p>Following mutual discussions among the silk merchants, two principles were decided: External Inspection: In the past, emphasis was placed on accurate weighing. Now, strict quality inspection should be implemented to prevent inferior goods from flooding the market. Sufficient preparation should be made for internal affairs, temporarily adopting a laissez-faire approach, allowing silk merchants to buy and sell freely. Regarding the grading of raw silk, Xue Shouxuan and Li Shuchu were appointed to discuss methods with the Bureau of Commodity Inspection and exporters.</p>
<p>Scheduled Inspection</p>
<p>In addition to deciding on the above two principles, opinions were exchanged during yesterday's meeting, which concluded around 5:00 PM. Further meetings will be convened in the coming days to discuss inspection details. The bureau has also scheduled a meeting with exporters at 10:00 AM today at the bureau to report on the situation regarding the Ministry of Industry's scheduled implementation of Chinese silk inspection starting July 1st and to solicit opinions on the current preparations.</p>
<h3>Tea Inspection Standards for the 25th Year Remain as Last Year, Coloring Tea Strictly Prohibited as Before</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry believes that with the current tea-making season approaching, the standards and regulations for inspecting tea leaves of various kinds and the measures to prohibit them should be announced urgently so that tea farmers and tea merchants can prepare as early as possible. The Shanghai and Hankou Bureaus of Commodity Inspection previously held a tea standard meeting in Shanghai and decided on four points: Inspection Method: The ash content part has long been consistent between the Shanghai and Hankou Bureaus, but for moisture inspection, due to the use of the weighing method, the oven is overly adjusted, and the test results are not without discrepancies. Now, the Hoffmann simple capacity method is used to ensure that the test results are consistent with each other. Inspection Standard: The red and green standard teas were agreed to remain in the same style as last year. For the moisture aspect, since the Hoffmann method is used, the average difference compared to the old method is actually increased by 1.5%, so the numbers remain the same as last year and are not changed. Prohibition of Coloring Tea: The method is the same as in the morning. After several years of rectification, the highest standard for coloring has seen a reduction in extremely dark coloring teas. This year, it will be reduced again, and actively adopt an improved yellow color material. When necessary, it is planned to cooperate with local governments to train inspection personnel to go to various places to guide. Tea Box Prohibition: Improved tea boxes, European and American tea merchants have repeatedly sent letters requesting attention. Our merchants also believe that improvement is necessary. It was agreed to issue an order to tea merchants, starting this year, to add twelve wooden strips to the current tea box to ensure that the box style remains unchanged and the firmness is doubled. The above items have been submitted by the Shanghai and Hankou Bureaus to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval in accordance with the resolution points, and it has now been ordered to be implemented.</p>

<h3>Agreement between the Two Special District Courts Continues to Be Valid from Yesterday, Based on Notes from Various Countries to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Notification Required Before June If Changes Are Desired</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Agreement Regarding the Establishment of Chinese Courts within the Shanghai International Settlement and the Agreement Regarding the Establishment of Chinese Courts within the Shanghai French Concession, since being continuously effective from April 1, 1933, has reached the end of its three-year term on April 1st of this year. As neither party has proposed any amendments, the agreement will continue to be valid from yesterday. Xin Sheng News Agency reporters specially visited Secretary-General Cha of the First Special District Court and Secretary-General Li of the Second Special District Court yesterday and learned the following details.</p>
<p>Brief History of the Agreement</p>
<p>The Agreement Regarding the Establishment of Chinese Courts (i.e., Jiangsu First Special District Local Court and Second Branch of the High Court) within the International Settlement was signed on February 17, 1930, by Xu Mo (representing Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and representatives of various countries: Deans (representing the Brazilian Minister), Jacob (representing the American Minister), Hitler (representing the British Minister), Grundfeldt (representing the Norwegian Minister), and Herlongmen (representing the Dutch Minister). The entire agreement consists of ten articles and became effective on April 1 of the same year. The Agreement Regarding the Establishment of Chinese Courts (i.e., Jiangsu Second Special District Local Court and Third Branch of the High Court) within the French Concession was signed on July 28, 1931, by Xu Mo and Wu Kunwu (representing Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and the French representatives Lague de Gangland (representing the French Minister to China). It became effective on July 31 of the same year. The International Settlement and the French Concession agreements were signed separately. Both agreements reached their initial expiration date on April 1, 1933.</p>
<p>Notes from Various Countries</p>
<p>Upon expiration, the British, American, Dutch, and Brazilian Ministers to China, and the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires to China, jointly sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that their respective governments had proposed extending the term of validity of the agreement and its associated exchange of notes for three years, effective from April 1, 1933. If any party wishes to terminate this agreement and its associated exchange of notes, it shall notify the other party six months before the expiration date; otherwise, it shall continue to be valid until six months after any party gives notice of termination. The French Minister to China also sent a similar note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Continued Validity</p>
<p>These two agreements have again reached their expiration date. Based on the above-mentioned notes, if any party wishes to terminate the agreement, it should notify the other party six months prior to the expiration date (i.e., before October 1 of last year). However, since our country has not made any proposals before this date, and the various countries have not expressed any opinions, both parties have tacitly agreed to continue the validity of the agreement from yesterday. The two Special District Courts have not received any instructions from the Judicial Administrative Department and are continuing to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The consular jurisdiction of various countries in China has not yet been abolished, preventing the complete independence of our judicial system. If the defendant is a national of a country with consular jurisdiction, the Special District Court has no jurisdiction and must file a lawsuit with the defendant's consulate. This often leads to discrepancies, and there are suspicions that the defendant's authorities are protecting them. According to investigations, excluding countries that have never had consular jurisdiction or have already abolished or relinquished it, the following countries still have consular jurisdiction: Old treaty expired, temporarily handled according to the original state. Old treaty has not yet expired. Old treaty expired, new treaty not yet determined. New treaty signed, allowing waiting for the Washington Conference countries to stop enjoying it, implement abandonment. New treaty signed, waiting for more than half of the countries with consular jurisdiction to abandon it, implement abandonment. Agreement to revoke consular jurisdiction, although signed, but not ratified. A list of countries that will be abandoned at the same time after the abandonment of the countries: Britain, the United States, France, Brazil, Japan, Sweden, Peru, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Merchants in the Special District Oppose Rent Reduction, Stopped Work Yesterday, A Small Number of Operating Vehicles Had Tires Deflated, Rickshaw Pullers Are in a Panic About Their Livelihood, Requesting Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The rickshaw problem in the Special District is due to the owners opposing rent reductions and refusing to prepay mutual aid fees. Vehicles were idled starting yesterday morning, leaving rickshaw pullers with no vehicles to rent, forcing them to suspend operations, and endangering their livelihoods. Both the owners and the rickshaw pullers petitioned various agencies yesterday, requesting assistance. The detailed situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opposing Rent Reductions and Idling Vehicles</p>
<p>The Municipal Council’s Vehicle Committee, in order to alleviate the burden on rickshaw pullers, specifically notified the Rickshaw Merchants' Association that from April 1st, the rent for each rickshaw in the Special District would be reduced to 77 cents per day (including 7 cents for mutual aid fees). The Rickshaw Association believes that this move not only affects the income of the owners but that the Vehicle Committee has violated the agreement reached in the previous year. They petitioned and negotiated with party and government agencies and the Municipal Council. However, the Municipal Council, considering it a matter of rescuing rickshaw pullers, insisted on reducing rent. Starting last month, they refused to pay mutual aid fees, opposed rent reductions, and convened an emergency meeting at 9 p.m. on the 31st, resolving to temporarily suspend business and idle vehicles in order to achieve a proper solution. Therefore, at 5:30 p.m. last night, they stopped renting out vehicles and went on strike.</p>
<p>Dispatching Representatives to Petition for Assistance</p>
<p>After the rickshaw owners of the Special District Rickshaw Association stopped renting out vehicles and went on strike, they dispatched representatives Yin Faling, Gu Songmao, Hou Shaoan, and three others to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession on Hong Kong Road at 1:30 p.m. yesterday to petition for assistance. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the association, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilu, as well as Chinese Directors and Committee Members Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and others received them. The representatives demanded that the following three points be addressed. Oppose reducing rickshaw rents, Increase the number of rickshaw pullers registered, Refuse to pay mutual aid fees. The reasons for the above three points were explained in detail, requesting them to strongly advocate to the Municipal Council. The association has agreed to forward a letter to the Municipal Council for negotiation.</p>
<p>Few Vehicles Available, Tires Deflated</p>
<p>The total number of rickshaws in the Special District of this city is 9,990, most of which have not been rented out. Therefore, there were few vehicles on the market yesterday. According to a reporter from the New News Agency who inquired at the Rickshaw Merchants' Association, there were only about 100 vehicles, all of which had been rented out in the previous few days and had not been returned. Therefore, although yesterday was a rainy day, most rickshaw pullers did not have oilskins. Forced deflation incidents occurred in areas such as East Jiaxing Road, Disiwei Road, and Fuzhou Road yesterday. The responsible police stations have dispatched additional detectives to guard the roads to prevent incidents. It is reported that dozens of people were arrested.</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Merchants' Association Issues a Statement</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Merchants' Association of the Special District issued a statement saying, "The rickshaw dispute in the Public Concession of this city originated from a group of Westerners who wanted to develop a monopoly on the public bus and other businesses they operate, and they are systematically and planfully undermining our rickshaw industry. Subsequently, as a result of the rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers fighting for their rights, an equal agreement was established with representatives of the Municipal Council on August 6, 1934, stipulating a daily rent of 78 cents and a daily mutual aid fee of 7 cents for rickshaw pullers. For the past two years, rickshaw owners and pullers have complied meticulously and have not dared to overstep the bounds. Unexpectedly, since the establishment of the Rickshaw Committee, it has adhered to the conspiracy behind the scenes, picking on everything and making things difficult in every way, in order to achieve its original intention of eliminating rickshaws and cutting off the livelihood of rickshaw pullers. Even with the rickshaw owners and pullers seeking compromise and making concessions repeatedly, they still feel that it is not enough. They have once again overturned the August 6th agreement reached in the equal conference, suggesting to the Municipal Council to further reduce the rent by eight cents per day from April 1st, while the mutual aid fees will continue to be paid. However, at a time when the market is depressed and rickshaw pullers' incomes are reduced, we will formally declare to the meeting that we will refuse to pay this uncompensated burden from April. Our association has submitted the situation in detail to the Municipal Council for consideration, but we have not yet received a reply. Unexpectedly, the Rickshaw Committee suddenly notified all rickshaw merchants on March 31 that it would implement the new rules from April 1st, implementing rent reductions and forcibly demanding the payment of mutual aid fees, or else licenses would be revoked. The rickshaw associations notified all rickshaw companies accordingly. Helplessly, the rickshaw pullers refused to pay the mutual aid fees based on their formal reasons, and the Rickshaw Committee relied on its power to forcibly collect them, putting the rickshaw merchants in a dilemma. If they continue to operate as usual, they will inevitably suffer heavy losses, and they will be at risk of being fined heavily and having their licenses revoked. Therefore, starting from April 1st, all vehicles have been forced to suspend business, and the livelihoods of rickshaw merchants and pullers are on the verge of collapse. In addition to appealing to the Municipal Council with reason and presenting to various party and government agencies and public groups for assistance, this association hereby lays bare the truth, hoping for your understanding."</p>
<p>The Subei Native Place Association Requests Assistance</p>
<p>After the Subei Native Place Joint Association received a letter from the Special District Office of the Rickshaw Industry Association requesting assistance, it dispatched representatives Cheng Xiechun, Song Shixiang, Gu Nanqun, and three others at 1 p.m. yesterday, with a letter to the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council to petition for negotiation. The original letter stated, "Respectfully, we received a letter from the Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association stating that our office had established an equal agreement with the Municipal Council on August 6 of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. According to the agreement, a Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society was established, and the expenses were borne by the rickshaw pullers at a rate of 7 cents of national currency per vehicle per day, and 1 yuan and 50 cents prepaid monthly by the rickshaw merchants. At that time, most of the rickshaw pullers were unwilling, and it took much persuasion from the rickshaw merchants to reluctantly accept it until now, which was not easy. Our office has now received a letter from the rickshaw pullers stating that the Mutual Aid Society, in name, is providing relief to the rickshaw pullers, but in reality, it has no rights to speak of. Moreover, at a time when the market is depressed and rickshaw fares are sharply reduced, it only adds to our burden with this expense, which is tantamount to a major exploitation. From April, all the 7 cents per vehicle per day in fees will be unanimously refused to be paid, and we request that all rickshaw merchants be notified not to continue to prepay on their behalf, etc. Based on this, our office believes that the rickshaw merchants are in a position to collect and pay the mutual aid fees on behalf of the rickshaw pullers. Since the rickshaw pullers are unanimously and resolutely refusing to pay, we feel that there are great difficulties. We have found that most of the rickshaw merchants and pullers are natives of Subei, and under these circumstances, we have no choice but to seek support. We respectfully believe that your association is the representative organization of Subei natives, and your enthusiasm for maintaining [our interests] is admired. We have prepared this letter respectfully requesting that you uphold justice, forward the letter to various agencies and public groups, clarify the truth, and unite to provide assistance so that a proper solution can be reached. The natives of Subei will be fortunate, and the rickshaw industry will be fortunate, etc. Based on this, the market has been depressed in recent years, and the rickshaw business has plummeted. Rickshaw merchants and pullers alike feel the suffering. Paying 7 cents for the mutual aid fee every day is truly an unaffordable burden for the rickshaw pullers who work hard. Moreover, since the authorities in the concession have implemented restrictions on rickshaw puller registration, rickshaw pullers have been forced to become unemployed, and the situation has become even more serious. We believe that most of these coolies are children of our Subei natives, adrift and destitute, which is truly pitiful, and it also has a significant impact on social security. We have decided to request the Concession Municipal Council to Stop collecting rickshaw puller mutual aid fees to reduce the burden. Continue to process rickshaw puller registration to relieve the suffering of rickshaw puller unemployment. We have always admired your directors' efforts to maintain the livelihoods of laborers, so we have specially dispatched Cheng Xiechun, Song Shixiang, and Gu Nanqun, three representatives, to come forward and earnestly request that you negotiate, to relieve the suffering of the rickshaw pullers and maintain social security. We are extremely earnest in our plea. This is addressed to the honorable Chinese directors."</p>
<p>The Association Held Another General Meeting Last Night</p>
<p>Since the rickshaw merchants went on strike yesterday morning, a small number of vehicles in the Special District, about 100, were still running in the central area of the British Concession because the rickshaw pullers refused to return them. However, unemployed rickshaw pullers were deflating tires in areas such as Hongkou, West Shanghai, Zhabei, and Nanjing Road. Prices have risen more than twofold. Public buses, trams, and taxis have all benefited threefold. The Rickshaw Industry Association, because the board of directors of the Municipal Council expressed that they would maintain the agreed-upon rickshaw rent, stated that they would insist on opposing it until a solution was reached. Therefore, they will continue to suspend business today. They also held another general meeting last night to discuss how to deal with the situation, deciding to petition all parties again to achieve the goal of avoiding rent reductions, etc.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors' Meeting Did Not Approve</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of reducing the rent for public rickshaws in the Public Concession, the rickshaw owners had previously sent representatives to negotiate with the Municipal Council authorities several times, requesting a temporary suspension of the implementation. During the meeting convened by the board of directors of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon, this issue was also brought up for discussion. However, as a result of the discussion, the directors felt that the rickshaw owners lacked sufficient reasons to make the bureau abandon its previously announced stance. Therefore, the rickshaw owners' request to postpone the rent reduction was not approved.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Present Three Demands</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers in the Special District are unable to rent vehicles, unable to work, and are in a panic about their livelihoods. At 2 p.m. yesterday, more than 300 rickshaw pullers intended to petition the Municipal Council as a group. The police, fearing that the large number of people would disrupt order, advised them to disperse. Immediately afterwards, they dispatched representatives Qin Zhaoliang, Chen Naicun, Gao Yongquan, Zhang Anren, and four others to petition the Municipal Council, demanding the Immediate order for rickshaw merchants to release vehicles to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. Mutual Aid Society fees will be paid as usual. Implement an eight-cent rent reduction to ease the burden. The chairman of the Vehicle Committee, Macy, received them and expressed acceptance, promising to contact the Rickshaw Merchants' Association and instructing the rickshaw pullers to wait patiently for a solution. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society Issues a Notice</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society separately notified its staff to arrive at the association office at around 6 a.m. to receive the rickshaw pullers who came to inquire about the news. By about 9 a.m., a total of more than 20,000 rickshaw pullers had arrived at the various association offices. In addition to discussing countermeasures with each other in the association offices, some were also drinking tea and resting. Although their attitude was激昂激昂, they were able to maintain order. Due to the large number of people, the children's school within the association office was closed for a day, and the classrooms were used for members to talk and rest. Later, the Mutual Aid Society put up a notice, and the staff explained it in detail. The main points are as follows. Wait for the Municipal Council to resolve the issue. Because the regulations regarding the amount of rickshaw rent are not within the authority of this association, but belong to the Municipal Council and the rickshaw merchants, they should wait patiently for its resolution. Strictly maintain public order. Because the livelihoods of the general rickshaw pullers are at stake, they cannot be completely patient. However, in the midst of desperation, they should still use legitimate and peaceful means. Impatience is of no help. Do not be used by others. Recognize the facts and do not listen to the words of others. As for the attitude of the rickshaw pullers, they feel that the current losses have been paid a considerable price, so they are willing to endure temporary pain to achieve final victory. They hope that the Municipal Council can resolve the issue as soon as possible and that people from all walks of life will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Accountants Association Requests Interpretation of Ambiguous Clauses in the Accountants Ordinance</h3>
<p>Concerning the Requirement to Join Local Associations Separately When Handling Affairs Outside the Place of Membership</p>
<p>The Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants, based on a proposal by accountant Li Wenjie, regarding ambiguities in Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Accountants Ordinance, the Sixth Council of the association resolved to request the Ministry of Industry to provide an interpretation. The original submission to the ministry is recorded as follows: Submitted to request an interpretation of the ambiguous clauses in Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Accountants Ordinance, so that it may be followed. The matter is that the association, based on a proposal by member accountant Li Wenjie, has the following proposal. Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Accountants Ordinance clearly stipulates that "An accountant shall not practice in a province or city without joining the accountants association of that province or city," and there is also Interpretation No. 835 issued by the Executive Yuan in the 21st year of the Republic of China. However, the scope of practice varies in breadth depending on the content of the commission. In the usual case, an accountant who establishes an office in a certain place is practicing in that place. In addition to applying for registration with the local industrial administrative authority in accordance with Article 8 of the Accountants Ordinance, they should also join the local or nearby accountants association, which is beyond doubt. However, the items of business that an accountant can perform are extremely broad, and there are no restrictions on the execution area in the regulations. Suppose an accountant in place A is engaged as an auditor or liquidator of a certain institution in that place. The institution is large in scale and has branches all over places B, C, D, and E. The accountant, based on the commission already accepted in place A, may, due to actual needs, go to the branches of the institution in places B, C, D, and E to handle matters related to the commissioned event. Commentators say that it is necessary to join the accountants association in each of those places one by one. I believe that such an interpretation is inevitably adhering to the wording of Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Accountants Ordinance, and the principle of that clause has not been carefully examined. Indeed, in the above example, the occurrence of the commission relationship is actually in place A. Since the accountant is a member of the accountants association in place A, if there are any violations of the Accountants Ordinance or disruptions to the discipline of the association in the performance of the commissioned business (including their actions in places B, C, D, and E), the accountants association in place A can impose appropriate sanctions in accordance with the articles of association. This is not comparable to an accountant who is not affiliated and can肆無忌憚肆無忌憚 do whatever they want. This is one point. If, as per the commentators' interpretation, there are twenty branches of an institution, and the accountant must take equivalent action for each of those branches due to the needs of the commissioned event, then it is imperative to join twenty associations. The economic burden is too heavy, needless to say, and the process of joining takes time, and the establishment of an office is a prerequisite for joining and registration, so how inconvenient is this? This is the second point. As far as the client is concerned, if the client's domicile or headquarters is in place A, and there are residences or branches in places B, C, D, and E, then in terms of the jurisdictional area of the civil and criminal courts, it should be based on the location of their domicile or headquarters. Then, the "province or city" referred to in Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Accountants Ordinance should refer to the province or city where the client's domicile or headquarters is located. If it is said that the branch accounts set up in various provinces and cities must be entrusted to accountants who practice in the provinces and cities where the branches are located, then large companies must entrust multiple accountants in different places to conduct fragmentary audits and certifications in order to audit their entire accounts, which is not allowed in fact. This is the third point. Furthermore, taking lawyers as an example, if a lawyer is registered in place A, they can only appear in court in place A, which is certain. However, if they go to other areas to investigate evidence or contact matters in connection with civil and criminal cases, there is no reason why this should not be allowed. Sending a report by an accountant is the main part of their commissioned event, which is equivalent to a lawyer filing a complaint and appearing in court. If the delivery of the report and the client who receives the report are both within the area of the province or city, and merely for the necessity of preparing this report, they go to other provinces and cities for related investigations and audits, then it is not necessary to join the association of that province or city, which also seems reasonable. This is the fourth point. To summarize the above reasons, it can be seen that when an accountant accepts a commission from a client at the location of the office (i.e., the place where they joined the association), and the client's domicile or headquarters is within the provincial or municipal area where the office is located, if there is a need to go to a branch of the client in another province or city to handle related matters, and the basic commission relationship has occurred and exists in the original location, it does not seem necessary to rejoin the accountants association of that other province or city. As for arbitrarily establishing an office in a place other than the location and soliciting commissioned events to handle, the basic legal relationship is obviously not related to the location of the office. In other words, the place where the contract is concluded and the place of performance, and the client's court jurisdiction, are not in the location, so it is still necessary to join the accountants association of that place. The above explanation seems to be well-founded, but since this point has a great relationship with the rights and obligations of members of various accountants associations, it is necessary to submit a request to the Ministry of Industry for interpretation in order to determine and comply with it. It is proposed that the association convene a council meeting to discuss and resolve it in order to proceed. The matter is deeply concerned by the public, etc. The association found that when a member of the association has the necessity to go to other provinces and cities to work within the scope of their commissioned business, they must join the association in that place one by one, and there are indeed the difficulties mentioned by member Li. Moreover, if the client's branches are set up all over the place, and it is necessary to force them to commission several accountants to conduct fragmentary audit work in their respective places, it will inevitably make the service efficiency of accountants greatly affected. The various points mentioned in the proposal are insightful. The Sixth Council of the association resolved to submit a request to your department for interpretation, etc. A record is kept on file, especially for a written request for review, grant an interpretation, so that it can be followed. This is truly for the public convenience. Respectfully presented to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3>Petition from the Bar Association Requesting Permission for Lawyers to Practice in Counties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, for the sake of protecting human rights, has been vigorously advocating to the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration for the addition of a special clause in the Provisional Regulations for the Organization of County Judicial Offices, allowing lawyers to practice law in county judicial offices. This matter has been submitted to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, which resolved to not only send letters to bar associations throughout the country (there are more than eighty bar associations in total) to collectively advocate for this, but also yesterday submitted separate petitions to the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting that the ministers of each Yuan and Ministry adopt the addition of a special clause to the regulations for the organization of county judicial offices, allowing lawyers to practice law in those offices. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>A petition requesting that the Provisional Regulations for the Organization of County Judicial Offices explicitly stipulate the permission for lawyers to practice in county judicial offices. It is noted that "Members Sun Zuji, Yu Chengxiu, etc., proposed: 'Upon investigating the matter of judicial reform, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has drafted Provisional Regulations for the Organization of County Judicial Offices as a temporary measure before the widespread establishment of courts. However, regarding the issue of permitting lawyers to practice in county governments concurrently handling judicial affairs, a resolution in principle was passed by the National Judicial Conference, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration was instructed to handle it with discretion. Yet, upon reviewing the entire text of the draft regulations proposed by the Ministry this time, there is no explicit provision for this. Therefore, after the implementation of county judicial reform in the future, it will be insufficient to implement the spirit of the aforementioned resolution. It is proposed to forward this petition to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, requesting that a special clause be added to the regulations for county judicial offices, permitting lawyers to practice, to serve as a standard.'" Based on this, the association submitted the matter to the 220th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, which resolved to petition the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration to adopt the proposal. In addition to submitting separate petitions, we hereby respectfully submit this petition to your esteemed Yuan and Ministry for review and adoption, as it is truly for the public benefit.

<p>Yesterday, Another Telegram was Sent to President Jiang Requesting the Ministry of Finance to Quickly Allocate Funds for Repayment</p>
<p>Wang Binyan, a prominent figure in Zhabei, previously advanced funds for military purposes and handled local relief matters. He mortgaged his private houses and properties to banks and money shops for large sums to cover these expenses. Now, Guangdong Bank and other creditors are pursuing the debts in court, and the court has already ruled for enforcement and sealed off the properties. These circumstances have been reported in previous newspapers. Prominent figures in this city, including Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Lu Bohong, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lantao, etc., again telegraphed President Jiang to appeal on his behalf and, based on the original consultation from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requested him to order the Ministry of Finance to quickly allocate funds for repayment to resolve the litigation. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from Yu Qiaqing and Others Appealing to Jiang</p>
<p>To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: We humbly report that the military advances during the Jiang-Zhe War in the thirteenth year of the Republic were contracted by Han Guojun, the former Governor and Military Supervisor of Jiangsu Province, to be repaid with the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau's land and property as collateral. The Zhabei portion of this, totaling over 220,000 yuan, includes a loan of 84,000 yuan (principal and interest) that Wang Dong of the Zhabei Charity Association borrowed from a bank using his private residence as collateral. The creditor is urgently pursuing the debt. We previously jointly requested the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allocate funds for repayment, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government issued a consultation to the Ministry of Finance stating that these advances were for military use, the contract clearly stated that they would be repaid with national property, and the matter had been reported to the Ministry for record. In fact, Wang Dong suffered due to public service, and it is inappropriate to disregard this after more than a decade. If Jiangsu Province had sufficient financial resources, it could have settled the matter from the provincial treasury, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. However, Jiangsu Province's recent financial difficulties are well known to your Ministry, and it is truly unable to do so. Accordingly, we are submitting photographs of the original contract and requesting your Ministry to verify and allocate funds for repayment. However, on March 23rd, the court sealed off Wang Dong's residence. The funds Wang Dong borrowed were indeed used for military purposes and to protect the locality, and he had no obligation to bear the burden privately. Moreover, the government at the time contracted to repay, and the facts are all present. However, due to the delay in settling the matter, a person with local enthusiasm has nowhere to live. We, He De, and others, who are also involved in handling local public welfare, are deeply saddened and fear that future generations will take this as a warning. In addition to the total debt still awaiting settlement through the repayment of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau's land and property, we humbly request that you quickly order the Ministry of Finance to advance the 84,000 yuan (principal and interest) of Wang Dong's residential mortgage to provide relief, as it would be a great act of kindness. Wang Dong submitted a petition in the thirteenth year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Wang Dong Submits a Petition to the Yuan and Ministry for Relief</p>
<p>I, Wang Dong, humbly report that in the thirteenth year of the Republic, I received a telegram from Han Guojun, the former Governor and Military Supervisor of Jiangsu Province, ordering me to handle all military supplies and maintain local relief matters, and to advance funds for various expenses, which were approved for disbursement. I ran around soliciting funds and advancing payments, and when the borrowed funds were insufficient, I did not hesitate to mortgage my private residence and property for large sums to meet the needs. The facts are clear, and responsibility lies where it should. Afterwards, I submitted a petition to the Provincial Government to allocate funds for repayment, but because the provincial treasury was depleted at that time and unable to repay, former Director of Finance Zeng was dispatched to Shanghai to jointly review and enter into a contract, which was after the military advances had been made. The circumstances have been repeatedly reported. I devoted my body and mind to the locality and relieved the hardships of the time, which was my long-held ambition. Regardless, due to the government's credibility and the established contract, and the responsibility to repay with the land and property of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau, the matter has not been fulfilled for more than a decade, leaving me bankrupt and without a place to live. Public opinion favors me, and the people's hearts are difficult to erase. This is a cry of sympathy, which is why the various public organizations and local figures in Zhabei have united to appeal, not only for my personal preservation but also to uphold justice. For the sake of Zhabei's security, I have suffered repeated warfare and have always committed myself to the locality, participating in every campaign without exception. No matter how difficult or dangerous, I acted with all my strength without hesitation, so that my heart would be at peace. Even during the unprecedented catastrophe of the January 28th Incident in Zhabei, I strived to secure the locality, such as by advocating for sovereignty and handling post-disaster affairs. I treated Zhabei as my second life and exerted my humble efforts to cooperate. Now that what I have offered to the locality is like this, and the result is like this, my heart is filled with sorrow and I am at a loss. Recalling that after the Jiang-Zhe War, all the military advances in the areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo lines were repaid, but these advances related to the contract, because they were collateralized by the land and property of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau, have not been settled to this day. Fortunately, the Jiangsu Provincial Government recognized the facts and clarified the responsibility under its former jurisdiction, and after more than a decade of accumulation, it would be inappropriate to disregard this, so it consulted the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds for repayment. A glimmer of justice still exists in the public interest. The total military advances in Zhabei amounted to more than 228,000 yuan, and what is now requested is only the 84,000 yuan for the portion mortgaged with private property, which the court has ruled to repay. I humbly request your compassionate consideration and approval for the allocation of funds for repayment, as it would be a great act of kindness.</p>
<p>Original Consultation from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>To Mr. Yu Qiaqing of Shanghai and forwarded to Mr. Du Yuesheng: I have received your telegram. The military advances of the Shanghai Zhabei Charity Association in the year Jiazi have been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for allocation of funds for repayment. A copy of the original draft is attached for your review and direct contact with the Ministry of Finance. Chen Guofu, Yang Seal. (Copy of the original consultation to the Ministry of Finance) The case states that Yu Hede, Du Yong, Wang Zhen, Chen Qicai, Zhang Yin, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Shen Yong, etc., stated in their telegram (excerpt omitted) and so on. Upon investigation, during the retreat from Zhabei during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War in the thirteenth year of the Republic, the Zhabei Charity Association advanced more than 220,000 yuan. At that time, a contract was jointly signed by the Jiangsu Provincial Military-Civilian Chief and the Finance Department, using all the land and property of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau as collateral for repayment. This contract was also copied and sent to the former Military and Finance Departments of the former army for review and record by the former Jiangsu Provincial Military Commander. In terms of its nature, this advance was for the use of the national army in the war. The contract stated that it would be repaid with national property, and the matter had been reported to the Ministry for record. In terms of the facts, Wang Dong, the head of the association, suffered due to public service, and it is inappropriate to disregard this after more than a decade. If Jiangsu Province had sufficient financial resources, it could have settled the matter from the provincial treasury, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. However, Jiangsu Province's recent financial difficulties are well known to your Ministry, and it is truly unable to do so. Now, according to the telegram requesting the return of 84,000 yuan to repay Wang Dong's private property mortgage, the wording is extremely urgent. In addition to replying by telegram, we are submitting photographs of the original contract and consulting your Ministry to verify and allocate funds for repayment. This consultation is to the Ministry of Finance, with one paper of photographs of the contract attached.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Band Regularly Holds Special Concerts</h3>
<p>—Also Will Perform for Free for Japanese Citizens—</p>
<p>At yesterday's regular meeting of the Municipal Council, the Music Committee suggested holding a special vocal music concert at the Grand Theatre on the 14th of this month.

At the same time, Chinese and Western singing groups have also agreed to join in the collaboration, and several German singers also intend to voluntarily join in the performance. As for the program, there will be Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 and the "Stabat Mater" by the famous Italian composer Verdi. Ticket prices are divided into several types: two yuan, one and a half yuan, and six jiao. It is also heard that because of the decision for a special concert, the weekly concerts on the 5th and 12th of this month will be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the Japanese Music Research Society of this city previously requested the Municipal Council Band to hold two free performances at the Hongkou Kabuki Theater, one for a children's concert without charging fees, and one for an adult concert with very low ticket prices. This matter was also discussed by the Music Committee a few days ago, and everyone agreed that free performances were feasible, but the Municipal Council should not bear any economic losses, and each performance must charge a slight ticket fee. It is heard that the above proposals have been approved by the Board of Directors.</p>

<h3>Tram Conductor Falsely Accuses Passenger of Theft; After Proof, Truth Comes to Light; Conductor Suspended</h3>
<p>Shen Zhixiang, a 26-year-old man from Changshu, was working as a teacher at a private school located at No. 223, North Nanlin Lane, Tianbao Lane, Haining Road. On the 26th of last month, he boarded tram No. 2 on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession and alighted at Eight Immortals Bridge. It was raining heavily and the tram was crowded, causing Shen to be slightly delayed in disembarking. Chen Anan, the conductor of tram No. 187, urged him from behind, leading to an argument between the two. The conductor, out of embarrassment and anger, falsely accused Shen Zhixiang of being a pickpocket and immediately summoned Chinese Constable No. 256, who brought Shen to the police station and then transferred him to the Second Special Court for investigation and further review. He was interrogated again yesterday. First, Detective Bao Anfu stated that after investigating the informant's statements, there was no evidence to support them, and there were passengers on the tram who could testify. At this point, Xu Haifeng and a Mr. Lu were summoned to court to testify, stating that they were also passengers on the tram that day. When Shen Zhixiang argued with the conductor Chen Anan, they stepped forward to mediate. The conductor accused them of being accomplices, and they all went to the police station, where they were released after no evidence was found. The conductor, relying on his position, insisted that Shen Zhixiang had stolen his foreign currency and demanded that he be prosecuted. The constable then ordered him to be detained and brought to court. Next, Chinese Constable No. 265 stated in court that the conductor came to report that he had caught three pickpockets on the tram and ordered him to bring them to the police station. However, the stolen foreign currency was given to him by the conductor, not found on the defendant. When questioned, Chen Anan remained silent. The defendant Shen Zhixiang requested the court to countersue for false accusation. Judge Chen Pusheng then declared Shen Zhixiang innocent and ordered Chen Anan to provide a guarantor with 500 yuan as security, pending transfer to the court's prosecutor's office for investigation. After a while, someone from the tram company came to the court, stripped Chen of his uniform, and suspended him from his duties.</p>

<h3>The Jiang'an Steamer: Passenger Commits Suicide En Route to Shanghai; Zeng Zhaobu Drowns Himself in the Waters of Twelve Forts Due to Family Ruin and Loss of Wife</h3>
<p>Zeng Zhaobu, the current captain of the Second Brigade of the Zhejiang Maritime Police, stationed in Zhenhai, Ningbo, and a native of Guangshan County, Henan Province, married the elder sister of Wen Xiyong as his wife. When the communists captured Guangshan, Zeng's wife was unable to escape and was killed by the communists. Although he later remarried, taking Yu Jialuan from Twelve Forts as his second wife, his affection for his first wife, Ms. Wen, was quite deep. This time, he was dispatched to the capital on official business. On March 30th, after completing all his affairs, at 4:00 PM that afternoon, he, along with his wife's younger brother, Wen Xiyong, and a first-class policeman, Jin Zhiyi, took nine pieces of official equipment to Xiaguan, boarding the Jiang'an steamer in cabin number 55 on the third deck to come to Shanghai, preparing to transfer to the Xinjiangtian steamer after arriving in Shanghai to return to Zhenhai to report for duty.</p>
<p>Mourning Wife, Commits Suicide</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM that afternoon, when the ship reached the waters near Twelve Forts between Zhenjiang and Gaozi, Zeng and Wen felt stifled in the cabin and went out together to the deck. They walked and talked, both recounting past family events. Zeng, deeply affected by the ruin of his family and the loss of his wife, suddenly suffered a mental breakdown. When they reached the edge of the third-deck platform, as Wen turned around, Zeng, taking him by surprise, jumped into the river from the third-deck platform. Wen, realizing something was wrong, hurriedly tried to pull him back, but Zeng was wearing a military uniform, and he couldn't grab him in time. Zeng fell straight into the river and committed suicide. At this moment, Wen was dumbstruck, speechless, and stood there blankly watching. As a result, no one on the ship knew that Mr. Zeng had committed suicide by jumping into the river.</p>
<p>Brother-in-Law's Mournful Cries</p>
<p>After Mr. Zeng jumped into the river, Wen did not report it. He went straight back to cabin number 55 and told the first-class soldier Jin Zhiyi. Wen, thinking of their familial ties, cried bitterly in the cabin, which was heard by the ship's tea boy. When the tea boy entered the cabin to inquire, he learned that Zeng had committed suicide by jumping into the river. However, by this time, about half an hour had passed since he fell into the water. The tea boy hurriedly reported to the captain, but the ship was about to arrive in Zhenjiang and was already thirteen nautical miles away from Twelve Forts. Even if they turned back, it would be difficult to rescue him, so Zeng's body has not been recovered to this day.</p>
<p>The Man is Gone, But His Belongings Remain</p>
<p>The Jiang'an steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday. After unloading some cargo at Yangshupu, it sailed to the Jinliyuan Wharf. Wen Xiyong and policeman Jin Zhiyi went ashore. Mr. Zeng's belongings, apart from luggage, included many letters and drafts, all of which were taken away by Wen on his behalf. Wen and Jin have taken the official equipment and transferred to another ship to return to Zhenhai to report the matter to the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over River Dredging at Fuxin Factory; Contractor Accused of Intimidation and Extortion; Threatens to Throw Manager Wang Yaochen into the Suzhou Creek; Contractor Chen Qingsheng Arrested, Denies Extorting Money</h3>
<p>Chen Qingsheng, Qu Haiji, Wang Daoqing, and others from Jiangbei are suspected of intimidating and extorting Wang Yaochen, the Wuxi native manager of the Fuxin Flour Factory. Wang reported this to the Xinzha Police Station yesterday, and detectives Ye Yushan and Yin Zhanqing were dispatched to arrest Chen, Qu, and Wang, taking them into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, in accordance with Articles 346, Section 1 and 3 of the Criminal Law, for the crime of intimidation and extortion, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court for public prosecution. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, then rose to state the facts of the case, saying that the Fuxin Flour Factory's Third Factory, in March of last year, wanted to</p>
<p>dredge a river in front of the factory gate. Manager Wang Yaochen contracted the river dredging project to the defendant Chen Qingsheng. However, after only half a month of work, the Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau took over the project, causing Chen's work to be stopped by the factory. However, since the work was stopped, although the accounts had been settled, Chen repeatedly harassed the factory, claiming to have suffered considerable losses. On July 23rd of last year, Chen coerced Wang Yaochen into lending him money.</p>
<p>In a threatening manner, Wang had the accounting clerk Li Yuxin pay him 50 yuan. Then, on January 15th of this year, when Zhang Zhenlin, the assistant manager of the Fuxin Factory, was passing through the intersection of West Suzhou Road and Datong Road in a chartered car, the defendant Chen Qingsheng stepped forward to stop the car and extorted 40 yuan by force. If he didn't give it, he would kill Zhang. At the time, Zhang couldn't resist and had to pay the full amount. Zhang Zhenlin died of illness two weeks ago, and his chauffeur Jiang Afu is now in custody and can testify. It was also found that Chen extorted 15 yuan from He Renrong, the assistant manager of the Fuxin Factory, at 17 Zhaoging Lane, Chengdu Road, on February 10th. Afterwards, he repeatedly harassed Wang Yaochen's residence at 18 Miaolong Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday morning, he and Qu Haiji and Wang Daoqing forcibly borrowed money from Wang, speaking disrespectfully and saying that if he didn't agree, they would throw Wang into the Suzhou Creek to drown. Wang, because Chen and others were unreasonable, reported the case to the police. According to Chen's confession at the police station, Wang Yaochen owed him 17,500 yuan, but Wang denied this. It was found that Wang Yaochen had recently received threatening letters, using excuses to extort money. The day before yesterday afternoon, he received another letter, demanding</p>
<p>as much as 100,000 yuan, with threatening words, saying he would use bombs to blow up Wang himself and his car. Therefore, the police station was deeply afraid that the threatening letters were related to the defendant Chen Qingsheng, and sent Chen's handwriting to the Shanghai Municipal Council's handwriting identification office to verify that it was different from the handwriting on the threatening letters. It may have been that Chen asked someone to write the letters for him, but the police station did not prosecute on this point. According to Wang Yaochen and witnesses Liu Jinkui, Wang Shihua, Jiang Afu, He Renrong, and others who successively filed reports, proving that Chen Qingsheng repeatedly came to forcibly borrow money. When questioned, Chen Qingsheng confessed that he had</p>
<p>contracted the river dredging project from Wang Yaochen, estimated to be 4,000 cubic meters, and there was a contract and insurance policy. Unexpectedly, after only half a month of work, the factory stopped the work, causing him to suffer huge losses. He had repeatedly negotiated with Wang without success, and he had not forcibly extorted money. When questioning Qu and Wang, their confessions were also evasive. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confessions and ruled that because the case still required investigation, he adjourned the hearing and ordered Wang Yaochen to bring the contract to court for inspection next time.</p>

<p>chop him in the back and other places, causing serious injuries. The police arrived, arrested Sun along with the murder weapon, and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Sun was sent to the Second Special Court and prosecuted for attempted murder. He was ordered to be interrogated again on another day. Yesterday afternoon, the interrogation continued. The court appointed lawyer Jin Xiongbai to provide free legal defense. According to Sun Changyu's confession, his wife, Ms. Wu, worked as an amah for a Russian family on Grossi Road,</p>
<p>and had committed adultery with his brother-in-law, Zhou Yunlong (the plaintiff). On September 29th of last year, he found out about it and reported it to the police station, who ordered detectives to arrest both the adulterer and adulteress and take them to the police station. Because his wife repeatedly begged him, promising never to do it again, he reluctantly agreed to a settlement, which is on record. Unexpectedly, not long after their release, they committed adultery together again, which made him very angry, so he used an axe to attack him. The judge asked if he had</p>
<p>intended to kill the plaintiff. Sun replied that he had no intention of killing him; it was just a moment of anger. When asked where the axe came from, he replied that on that day, he was passing by the area and saw his wife walking side by side with the plaintiff. A secondhand goods seller happened to be passing by, and he saw that the seller had an axe on his shoulder, so he temporarily borrowed it to commit the crime. Detective Zhang Yulin said that on September 29th of last year, Sun Changyu came to the police station to report that his wife was committing adultery with Zhou Yunlong. The chief detective sent him to</p>
<p>arrest the adulterer and adulteress, and they reached a settlement at the police station, which is on record. Zhou Yunlong, the plaintiff, was unable to appear due to his injuries, so his wife, Zhou Shi, appeared in court and stated that the defendant's wife was her cousin and did not know about the adultery with her husband. Her husband was injured for no reason, and she requested a civil claim of 15,840 yuan. Her husband could earn 60 yuan per month, and since he was 38 years old, there were still 22 years of lost income until he was 60 years old. The whole family, old and young,</p>
<p>depended on her husband for a living. Now that he was injured and disabled, she must seek compensation, and she hired a lawyer to argue on her behalf. The judge ordered the start of the debate. First, the police station's lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, stated that although the defendant denied premeditated murder, his actions of seriously injuring others were obvious, and he requested a legal judgment. Then, the defendant's free lawyer, Jin Xiongbai, debated for a long time. Judge Wang Gangxu then declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the afternoon of the 8th of this month.</p>

The Chinese Painting Association believes that it is of great importance to the art world and is holding an exhibition for him. It will be held at the Ningbo Association of Fellow Provincials on Xizang Road in this city from the 3rd to the 5th of this month.

<h3>Shanghai's Woolen Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit</p>
<p>(Twenty of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview)</p>
<p>II. Source of Woolens and Market Price</p>
<p>Most woolens are imported from overseas, as mentioned earlier. By country of origin, the United Kingdom produces the most and the best quality. Germany, Italy, and France are next. Polish woolens, with their fashionable designs, have become very popular in recent years. Since their public sale last year, Japanese woolens (such as serge and floral serge) have been sold widely due to their particularly low prices, putting pressure on both British and domestic goods. The production of domestic goods is very limited, mainly from factories such as Zhanghua and Renli. There is also production from the Sino-American joint venture Haijingbo Woolen Mill, but due to high costs, sales have not been strong.</p>
<p>As for the woolen market, it has changed greatly throughout the past year. Before November, prices were in continuous decline. After November, due to the implementation of the new currency policy, foreign exchange rates fell, and the cost of imported goods increased by 20-30%. After discussion among industry members, prices were raised by 10%, and the market began to recover. Now, several common types of serge and floral serge are selected. The market prices for the entire last year are compared in the following table:</p>
<p>Note: The above two tables are priced per yard, and the price unit is yuan.</p>
<p>Many urban residents in China wear woolen clothing. At a time when there are loud cries to save the country through domestic goods, we should quickly promote the domestic woolen manufacturing industry. This is what we should pay attention to. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Report of the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Survey Group (9)</h3>
<p>— Yang An from Guilin</p>
<p>The People's Militia and Rural Construction in Wuming</p>
<p>Wuming is the center of the People's Militia in the Nanning District. There is a People's Militia Headquarters, a People's Militia Cadre School, and an agricultural and forestry demonstration field, etc., under the leadership of Lieutenant General Liang Hansong. The reporter traveled three hundred miles through rugged mountains to Wuming to observe the People's Militia drills. Thousands of people were gathered on the field, and they were orderly and solemn. The reporter was moved by this. The Nanning District governs seventeen counties, four hundred and twenty-five townships, and four thousand five hundred and ninety-three villages. National basic schools have been established everywhere, and the people should all receive People's Militia training. It is estimated that 400,000 people should be trained, and 150,000 have already been trained. We visited the Junior High School Military Training Brigade. All aspects of life follow military and police procedures. Clothing and dormitories are regulated. In addition to outdoor exercises, indoor courses are wartime courses. Field exercises are held twice a week and include camping, mountain climbing, and shooting as daily routines. Observers praised this spirit incessantly. The village office focuses on the rural economy, afforestation, fish farming, pig farming, chicken farming, and winter crops. In the past, the total output of agricultural products in the district was only 500,000 to 600,000 dan per day. Now it has increased to over 10 million dan. The farmers are very happy. What makes them particularly happy is road construction. The province has provincial roads, the county has county roads, the township has township roads, and the village has village roads. Our cars travel through the villages as if on flat ground. We also saw hundreds of men, women, and children, young and old, engaged in road construction and bridge building. It is commendable and admirable. The village also has telephones, which are very fast for mobilization. Villagers work for public works for two days each month. Therefore, villages have warehouses, fish ponds, rice paddies, orchards, forests, and swidden land. In short, the village has an economy and pays great attention to it, and public undertakings also depend on it. Most villagers are very frugal, and men and women are engaged in production. The center of rural education is the national basic school, with children and adults. Mr. Liang also runs a work-study school for the dependents of civil servants, which is a novel approach to vocational education. He teaches by working and sets an example for the people, which is worthy of emulation. Now the villages have a common goal of self-government, self-defense, and self-sufficiency. They cooperate to increase local wealth and reduce consumption, which is the common responsibility of the masses. This kind of rural construction combines military, cultural, political, and economic aspects into one. It is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Liuzhou, we went to the city to observe and asked the magistrate of Liuzhou County, Mr. Yang, about the commercial situation. According to him, the commercial situation has been slightly reduced recently due to the impact of the recession. Domestic goods are the main sales in the market, but some merchants are greedy for petty profits and sell foreign goods. However, the market price is slightly higher, which is not very cost-effective, so there is nothing to fear. What is to be feared is that a certain country's goods are imported through smuggling and small shipments. This is impossible to prevent. Since no taxes are paid, the prices are naturally low, and everyone is greedy for cheap goods, which inevitably leads to rushing to them. The Wuzhou Revenue Bureau and the import and export trade office are paying special attention. On the one hand, the people have been educated, and their patriotic heart is becoming more and more intense. This may be avoided in the future. This depends on the efforts of enthusiastic local men and women to promote it.</p>
<p>Then we went to Guilin for inspection. Although it is a cultural area with the best scenery in the world, the population is sparse, and commerce is also declining. The goods in the market are all imported from Guangzhou and Hong Kong through Wuzhou. Although domestic goods are very developed, it is difficult to eliminate foreign goods. The reason is also mostly tax evasion and smuggling. When talking with the committee members of the Guilin Chamber of Commerce, they all hoped that Shanghai domestic goods would be imported more so that the people would not have to rely on imported goods for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. At the welcoming banquet of the Chamber of Commerce, many committee members also hoped that Shanghai domestic goods factories would set up branches in the interior to reduce tariffs and transportation costs, so that the cost of goods could also be reduced. They also said that the province is very willing to organize a domestic goods consumption group to advocate for the interior. After observing the people of Guilin Province, they are simple, hardworking, thrifty, and frugal, and it is easy to break away from foreign goods. However, there are many supplies that are used to imported goods, and they do not know that domestic products have long been supplied. This is due to the lack of publicity from Shanghai domestic goods factories. Therefore, in the future, more people should be sent to the interior to negotiate and distribute samples so that the people in the interior can know that domestic goods are available and naturally willing to buy them, and the imported goods will be resisted without resistance.</p>

<h3>Students in Beiping Parade: Peking University Expels Wu Peicang and Others; Students Clash with Police, and Many Are Arrested</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) After the authorities cracked down on student movements, students from various universities in Beiping have been silent for a long time, but they have been secretly active. Today (31st), more than 500 male and female students convened a conference in the auditorium of the Third Institute of Peking University in the name of the Beiping Municipal Student Union at 9:00 a.m. After the conference, they paraded and clashed with the police. The telephones of various schools were temporarily interrupted, and the situation did not calm down until about 2:00 p.m. Chiang Meng-lin, the president of Peking University, was unaware of the students' actions beforehand and issued two notices afterward. One was to stop the activities of the student union, and the other was to expel Wu Peicang, Wu Xingsan, Han Tianshi, and Ye Jilin.</p>
<p>The situation of the memorial service. Guo Qing was a student of the Hebei Provincial High School and a strongman in the last student movement. After being arrested and imprisoned, he died in prison. The Student Union originally planned to hold a memorial service at Fu Jen Catholic University today (31st), but because the military and police were prepared, it was temporarily changed to a conference in the Third Institute of Peking University. An empty coffin was placed in the center of the auditorium, representing Guo Qing's coffin. The coffin was surrounded by black cloth, and there were more than 30 wreaths from the student unions of Girls' No. 1 Middle School, North China University, Datong School, Tsinghua University, Peking University, Normal University, etc. A portrait of Guo Qing was placed on the coffin, and many elegiac couplets and eulogies were hung on the walls around it. The eulogy of the Beiping Student Union was more than ten feet long and more than 10,000 words. The Tianjin-Hebei Student Union sent a white banner with the inscription "Guo Qing is not dead today. He fights for the nation. Though dead, he lives." Students from more than 50 schools, including Peking University, Normal University, Tsinghua University, Beiping University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, China University, Hua University, Min University, Korea University, Sino-French University, Art School, Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, Municipal Normal School, Municipal No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, No. 5 Middle School, Commerce, Vocational, Huazhong, Wenzhi, and Datong, attended the meeting. Representatives from Peking University, Normal University, and Tsinghua University were elected as the presidium. First, the chairman read the eulogy, and the whole body was silent for three minutes. Then the chairman reported on Guo Qing's industrious production, diligent learning, and his propositions. Then the representative of the Women's National Salvation Vanguard gave a speech, and finally a free speech. Then an emergency meeting was convened and the following proposals were passed (omitted).</p>
<p>Clashes during the parade. The military and police authorities learned that the students were holding a meeting and sent 120 military and police officers to surround the Third Institute of Peking University. Twenty unarmed policemen and three machine guns were set up at the gate of Peking University, and ten large cars were there. When the meeting was in session, the military and police went to monitor it and closed the gate. When the students saw this, dozens of people crossed the wall and escaped through the gate of Kongde College. Another group of students tried to go out through the school gate and carried the coffin out. Before long, they formed a team outside the school. Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and North China University were in the front, and Peking University and Normal University were in the last team. The girls mixed into the boys' team. The team passed through Dong'anmen and Beichizi and went to Qihelou. The police arrived and clashed with the students, and the order was in chaos. For a time, traffic in Dongcheng was cut off, which was no less serious than the last student movement. A small number of girls escaped into nearby residences and were spared. Fourteen male and female students, including Liu Shuyun, were arrested on the spot, and more than 20 people were injured.</p>
<p>Peking University expels students. Peking University posted a notice at 7:00 p.m. that night to deal with the student unrest. The original text is recorded below. Notice: At 9:00 a.m. today, students from various colleges of our school were holding a meeting in the auditorium in the name of the Beiping Municipal Student Union. At the same time, leaflets issued by the Student Executive Committee of our school were found in various dormitories of our school with the seal "Meeting in the auditorium of our school this morning." The Student Executive Committee of our school had already known about this meeting in advance but did not report it to the school or request permission from the school. Temporarily, they refused to listen to the dissuasion of the staff in the school, which led to military and police intervention and hindered the safety of the school. The Student Executive Committee should bear major responsibility for this matter. In order to ensure the safety of the whole school, this student union will immediately cease all activities. This notice. Notice: Wu Xingsan, Wu Peicang, Han Tianshi, Ye Jilin and other four students of our school have disrupted the order and endangered the safety of the whole school and should be expelled immediately. This notice.</p>
<p>Attitude of the Beiping Municipal Government. The Beiping Government announced the news tonight (31st) that at 9:00 a.m. today, 400 to 500 students in the city suddenly sneaked into the Third Institute of Peking University, claiming to rescue the arrested students and buying a coffin from Luomashi, which was dragged into the institute by car, saying that they would hold a memorial service, and distributing various reactionary leaflets and slogans. Chiang Meng-lin, the president of Peking University, was very angry that foreign students sneaked into the school to hold a meeting and brought a coffin into the school, which was an insult, and issued a notice to expel them, which was not effective. The Public Security Bureau and the Military Police Command ordered the Sixth District, which was in charge, to send police to stop them. When two officials from the district office entered to contact and dissuade the students, some of the students closed the gate of the Third Institute and destroyed the wall of Kongde School. The workers of the school were also beaten when they tried to stop them. Then they rushed out of Kongde School, each holding a flag and carrying an empty coffin, parading to Beichizi. The police stepped forward to disband them, but they refused, and there was a slight conflict. Several policemen were injured. In order to maintain local order, the police immediately arrested several people, and the rest were dispersed. It is heard that the authorities believe that the students' actions are obviously supported by someone and will strictly investigate the masterminds in accordance with Article 3 of the National Government's Emergency Measures for Maintaining Security.</p>

<p>School Investigation</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shanghai French School (3)</h3>
<p>By Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>Under the principal of the school, there is a vice-principal to assist the principal in handling disciplinary matters in the school. The vice-principal is promoted from the teacher who has served the longest in the school, and usually has to take on half of the teaching workload. When the principal is absent, they act as an agent for all school affairs. The teachers in the school are fully responsible for teaching and do not hold any other positions. There are also two discipline officers who do not teach classes, and are responsible for supervising student safety during breaks. They usually handle minor disciplinary matters concerning students. For major matters, they must ask for instructions or transfer them to the principal or vice-principal for handling. All faculty and staff members hold a meeting once a month to discuss teaching issues or exchange research ideas.</p>
<p>Financial Revenue and Expenditure The school's budget for this year is over 194,500 yuan; tuition revenue is about 39,000 yuan, so the French Municipal Council actually allocates about 155,500 yuan this year. In the entire budget, the salaries of all faculty and staff members and the wages of the school workers account for about 186,000 yuan, accounting for more than 91% of the total expenditure; this is because the faculty and staff members are full-time employees, and there are few changes, so salaries increase year by year, while the amount of equipment to be added each year decreases due to the gradual increase in equipment each year. This year's other office expenses and equipment purchases are about 8,100 yuan. The amount of tuition paid by students varies from 5 yuan to 25 yuan per month, and is paid by parents or guardians at the end of each month. The school has 430 students this semester. Assuming that there are 860 students throughout the year, the French Municipal Council allocates about 185,500 yuan to the school each year. If divided equally among 860 students, the average education expense borne by the council for each student each year is about 180 yuan. In addition, students pay a total of about 39,000 yuan in tuition each year. If divided equally among 430 students, each parent bears a tuition fee of about 90 yuan per year for each child enrolled in the school.</p>
<p>Strict Training</p>
<p>French schools advocate strict training. French educators have little trust in children's self-management and self-training abilities; therefore, they believe that teachers and discipline officers must directly train students. They advocate strict training for four reasons:</p>
<p>French children have a tendency to yearn for individual freedom and equal treatment, so educators must train them to accept statutory regulations.</p>
<p>Since obedience is the first principle of social training for adults, citizens aged two to twenty must have more opportunities to learn obedience training.</p>
<p>The amount of work that students need to do in school can only be completed under strict division of labor and supervision, so students cannot be trusted to train themselves automatically.</p>
<p>Since the school principal is responsible for the entire behavior and health of students, he should of course implement the training work responsibly.</p>
<p>This organization of strict training can be divided into two aspects: day schools and boarding schools:</p>
<p>Day Schools During class time, all student behavior is completely the responsibility of the teacher for guidance. During recess, the discipline officer is responsible for supervising the safety of students and supervising student behavior. Punishment methods include demerits, detention, suspension, expulsion, etc. Corporal punishment is prohibited by the government.</p>
<p>Boarding Schools In boarding schools, student behavior is even more closely supervised by the school. Except for holidays and Thursday afternoons and Sundays, students live within the walls of the school all year round and cannot go out of the school gate even a step. Students are closely supervised by discipline officers at all times in the school: when they are reading, there are teachers supervising; when they are eating, playing, and going to bed, there are discipline officers supervising.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoons, students can take excursions in the countryside, but they still do not have the opportunity for free activities. They must walk in line; even when playing ball games, there are discipline officers to supervise them. On Sundays, students' parents can take the students home once.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Shanghai School for Blind Children: Enthusiastic Support from All Quarters</h3>
<p>The School for Blind Children at 290 Hongqiao Road in this city was founded by Dr. John Fryer, a British scholar, who used his own funds. For more than twenty years, it has provided great benefits to the blind people of China and has been highly praised by all sectors of society in Shanghai. Therefore, they have enthusiastically supported the school's fundraising campaign on April 4th. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It has recently been heard that people from all walks of life have sent letters to the school's principal, George B. Fryer, expressing their willingness to be responsible for diligently selling commemorative badges. Furthermore, Dr. Zhao of the YMCA Middle School, Principal Yang of the Public Works Bureau Girls' School, Zheng Lian of Peicheng Girls' School, Chen Heqin, and others, especially Chen Heqin, are responsible for more than 10,000 badges, which is the largest number. Although there are still several days before the fundraising date, those who have already paid donations include Wang Yiting (200 yuan), Jiang Jianbai (200 yuan), Principal Zhang of Qingxin Girls' School (200 yuan), and the Chinese Women's Association (400 yuan).

In order to avoid dispersing excellent athletes, it was decided to postpone the expedition to Korea temporarily in order to jointly organize a strong and powerful team to go and fight. The departure date is about mid-next month. However, in order to fulfill the previous agreement, the team decided to transfer to Korea after the competition in Japan. The return date is about one month. Therefore, the Zhenhuan team's eastward expedition today is temporarily suspended. (Jin)</p>

<h3>Public Target Shooting Competition: Zhang Yingda Wins Qualification for Finals, Beating Englishman Bernal by a Score of 1000 to 948; Bao Qiyun and Zhu Qiliang to Compete for Junior Championship Today</h3>
<p>Our country's renowned target shooting expert, Zhang Yingda, competed yesterday in the senior semi-finals of the amateur target shooting competition at the International Recreation Club on Jing'an Temple Road against the veteran British shooter, Bernal.

<p>Turning Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>Zhang Yingda started with a smooth shot of 25, seemingly foretelling a good omen. Bernal steadily progressed, and the two were neck and neck, making it difficult to determine who was ahead. In the first half, Bernal achieved high scores of 46, 33, 34, and 58 consecutively, surpassing Zhang several times by over 50 points. However, as they approached 500 points, Zhang Yingda reversed the situation, leading with 500 points to Bernal's 457. This was because Zhang scored more points per shot on average. Consequently, his final shot of 45 points allowed him to turn defeat into victory. At that time, Zhang's high scores included numbers such as 25, 27, 22, 20, and 24.</p>
<p>Preserving Victory</p>

At one point, he led by over 150 points with a score of 736 to 562. Although he encountered setbacks later on, he was able to preserve his victory thanks to this large lead. Bernal's chances for a comeback came frequently, and at one point, the score reached 922 to 923. However, luck did not favor him, and several times he almost hit the target but missed, allowing Zhang to take advantage and surge ahead, winning with a score of 1000 to 948. Zhang's high scores in the second half were 21, 74, 36, 47, 25, 29, and 31. Bernal's were 26, 31, 25, 26, 51, 24, 46, and 57.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bond Market Gradually Becomes Active, Sudden Surge in Selling Yesterday, Significant Decline in Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese Securities Exchange saw a relatively active market, unseen in over a month. Due to a sudden surge in selling, the trend experienced a significant decline. Trading activity increased accordingly, confirming the reporter's prediction that prices must first fall before trading can be stimulated. There were no significant new changes in the environment, and most factors were still brewing. Most of the selling pressure in the market came from those who had not previously shorted, such as numbers 10 (formerly 78), 11, and 47, who maintained their consistent principles. Market sentiment remained quite sluggish. However, number 4 was inactive yesterday, temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. Although the future is not yet optimistic, a rebound may be inevitable, as prices have fallen for many consecutive days, and the B and D bonds are not far from their lowest prices. Yesterday, trading in the morning saw relatively more selling from numbers 11 and 35, and market prices gradually declined, falling by 0.15 to 0.4 yuan. The second session was relatively stable, but still sluggish and unable to rise, fluctuating by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, with some as much as 0.15 yuan. In the afternoon, selling from numbers 35 and 47 continued to surge, while number 5 saw significant buying. The D bond for May, which had not been traded for three days, suddenly fell by 1.45 yuan, with the rest also down by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. At the close, selling pressure was particularly strong from number 47, and numbers 10 and 35 continued to sell. Number 54 absorbed at the lower prices, and the tail was slightly propped up, but still down by 0.15 or 0.3 yuan. The aforementioned D bond was down another 0.55 yuan. The entire day saw a declining trend, with no signs of recovery. Only the buying of A and B bonds by number 54 at the close seemed to have an intention to prop up prices. Only 96 remained stable and without ups and downs, and trading was not small. As a result, all government bonds declined, except for 96, which was down by only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The furthest distant D bond was down by as much as 1.7 yuan, and the E and B bonds were mostly down by about 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 5.42 million, with C, E, and B bonds accounting for over 3.1 million, and the spot market accounting for 1,000. The resulting price changes are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, effective unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Few New York Stocks Soar Drastically</h3>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (31st), the New York stock market advanced unevenly, but trading was very weak. A few stocks soared drastically, and some rose by more than 2 yuan. Steel stocks rose due to increased work, and US Steel once rose to its highest peak since June 1930. Auto stocks rose near the close, retail stocks rose slightly, and utility stocks were stable. However, buying interest was not very strong, due to weak grain futures, unstable foreign situations, and difficult tax legislation. However, it was heard that London's buying was more than before, and investment in steel stocks was particularly strong. Small exchange stocks showed some unevenness. In the bond market, corporate bonds rose slightly and government bonds fell slightly. The total daily transaction volume was 1.04 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Qingdao Yarn Prices Rise, Marked Yarn Market Slightly Increases</h3>
<p>The yarn market declined in the morning and advanced in the afternoon, but the situation was calm, and it remained in a hovering state. The intention of the industry was unanimously inclined towards the bearish side, and the yarn stored in the yarn and cloth warehouses still had no mobility. Therefore, the bearish side continued to sell when prices rose. In the afternoon, it was heard that Qingdao yarn prices rose by 3 to 4 yuan, and confidence was boosted, so they rose again.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Bearish Side Slightly Active</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened in the morning, with overseas yarn and cotton conditions all rising. The atmosphere in the market was good, and all months rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. However, after the second session, there was a lack of buyers, the cotton market was mediocre, and the market turned down. The bearish side was slightly active, and the results for each month fell by 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the market was even more unstable, and each month continued to fall by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. However, after the second session, prices recovered and rose again, due to the continued rise in the Qingdao yarn market, and the active demand from Tianjin and Guangdong merchants for spot goods. The results for each month rose by 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuanyi sold 1,650 bales, Yicheng 650 bales, Runkang 850 bales, Xiecheng 600 bales, Jifeng 650 bales, Shengyuan 300 bales, Gengfeng 300 bales, and Dafu 300 bales.

<h3>Large Investors Buy At Low Prices, Cotton Decline Rescued</h3>
<p>The cotton market was quite weak in the early morning, due to the continued selling by Shanghai cotton firms, with about 20,000 dan sold in two days. The market situation was slightly hampered, but Tongji's bulls and the financial sector came to drag in at the lower prices, and the amount was huge, so the decline was rescued. Prices recovered and rose in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Market Rebounds</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning. US cotton rose by 3 to 13 points due to buying on Wall Street. Indian cotton was closed, and Osaka Sanpin cotton rose by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 yuan. However, the atmosphere in the market was gloomy and listless, because local cotton merchants Yuanxingchang and Yikang continued to sell, so the market still brought a tired trend. Each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. After the second session, Tongji came to drag in again, and the unstable atmosphere was resisted. The results for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the market situation improved, the table was calmer, and the yarn market was good, so the cotton market brought an increase. The results for each month rose by 0.1 to 0.15 and 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price.

Due to rainy weather, people thought that prices would increase, so the price of Jiangsu and Tongxiang glutinous rice increased by 0.1 yuan, the price of Nangang early rice increased by 0.01 yuan, but the thin rice market was not active, so prices remained stable. Du rice, top rice, and cloudy rice prices did not change much.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 32 or 33 ships came from downriver. The market conditions were normal. The price of top-quality white glutinous rice was stable, the price of upper-middle rice increased by 0.05 yuan, the price of lower-middle rice increased by 0.1 yuan, the price of cloudy rice increased by 0.06 or 0.07 yuan, the price of Yangdu rice increased by several points, and the price of customer-pointed rice also increased by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. There was a slight arrival of thin rice, but the market was weak, so prices were stable. The prices of other goods also showed an increasing trend. Although the market was open, the weather remained rainy and there were few sales.</p>
<h3>Customer Glutinous Rice Market With Heavy Stocking</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer-made goods arrived, and the Yangtze River and Wenzhou also shipped goods, but sales were active, and market prices continued to increase. Yesterday, the best sales came from this street, and retail customers were also active, so the prices were increased by 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. Jiangxi rice had the best sales, with more than 8,000 bags sold at the night market. Early machine rice and brown rice also had 2,000 bags each, Taiwan rice had 2,320 bags, Jiangbei rice had 1,200 bags, Wu rice had 60 bags, and Siamese rice had 100 bags. In addition to the 2,000 bags of Jiangxi late rice sold to retail merchants, all the rest were bought by merchants on this street. At present, the merchants on this street and the retail merchants are actively buying, and the market will improve again.</p>
<h3>Soybean Oil Speculation Unusually Excited</h3>
<p>Due to the high prices in Dalian for several days, the standard soybean oil market had active spot sales, and prices were all rising. Outside speculation was active. Large traders did not reduce their purchases. Yesterday, Lian dian once again rose, market sentiment was even stronger, and the rain affected the spring harvest. Outside bull trading was especially strong, driven by booming sales in the spot market. As a result, marked oil rose by 0.3 yuan for both near and distant months, marked soybeans rose sharply by 0.17 yuan, and marked bean cakes rose by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Swatow Exchange Rate Shrinks Frequently, Chaozhou Sugar Rises Again</h3>
<p>Domestic Chaozhou: According to yesterday's oil head telegram, production prices have risen again, and the Swatow exchange rate has shrunk by five yuan.

However, it is still difficult to reach these prices in the Shanghai market, resulting in a backwardation. Only over two hundred bags of Red Sugar were offered on the market, with the higher price being 12 yuan and 77 cents, and the next highest, 65 cents, showing a slight increase.</p>
<p>The association's bids remained largely unchanged. No price movements were seen for #24 Coarse Granulated White Sugar, Eastern Red White Sugar, etc. Our factory's Mian White Gold Heart #1 was 20 yuan and 80 cents, and Zhenji #1 was 20 yuan and 60 cents, with #2, #3, #4, and #5 following the same rates.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company's bid exchange period expired yesterday. The bid price could have slightly increased, but due to the customs duties loosening, it did not. The original price was maintained. The fixed quota was 1,823 bags. Five Sheep Coarse White Sugar was 21 yuan and 80 cents, and Xi Xi Factory's product was 21 yuan and 60 cents. #2 Di White was 21 yuan and a few cents, and #4 was 20 yuan and 90 cents, totaling 905 bags sold.

<h3>Su Wu Herding Sheep</h3>
<p>— Du Zhenyu</p>
<p>In ancient times, our country's northern border had a formidable enemy, the Xiongnu. During the Zhou dynasty (from 2300 BC to 700 BC), they constantly harassed China's borders. By the Warring States, Qin, and Han periods (from 2100 BC to 200 BC), their power grew daily – besides their original base (present-day Mongolia), nearly all of Donghu (the northern part of present-day Northeast China) and the Western Regions (present-day Qinghai and Xinjiang) fell under their influence. Having such power, they held China in contempt and continually invaded its borders. In the 7th year of Emperor Gaozu of Han (2111 BC), due to their repeated invasions, he dispatched 320,000 troops to quell them, but they fell for the enemy's feigned retreat, and were surrounded at Pingcheng (east of present-day Datong County, Shanxi) for seven days and nights before escaping. In the 3rd year of Emperor Hui of Han (2103 BC), because Empress Lü was in power in China at the time, the Xiongnu's Modu Chanyu (Chanyu was the Xiongnu's political leader, like China's emperor) wrote a letter "filled with extreme indecency" to Empress Lü, containing many blasphemous words. Empress Lü was enraged and immediately convened a meeting of ministers, wanting to kill his envoy and send troops to punish him. However, because China's military strength at the time could not match theirs, they had to swallow their anger and appease them with "harmonious relations" – "harmonious relations" was a strange and shameful "appeasement policy" unique to the Han dynasty, involving marrying daughters of the Chinese imperial family to foreign emperors as concubines, using this kinship to maintain diplomatic relations between the two countries. Both of these incidents were great humiliations for the Han dynasty. Therefore, at the beginning of Emperor Wu of Han's reign (2051 BC), he wanted to give them a severe lesson so that they would not dare to look down on China. At that time, China was very wealthy and strong because of fifty or sixty years of peace, so he sent troops to attack them. After several battles, they indeed began to fear China. In the first year of Emperor Wu's Tianhan era (2011 BC), the Xiongnu's Yilizhi Chanyu died, and his brother was made Qiedihou Chanyu. Qiedihou Chanyu feared that China would take advantage of the mourning period to attack them, so he tried his best to be friendly with China – returning all the Chinese envoys previously detained. Emperor Wu believed that the Xiongnu were sincerely submitting, so he did not dwell on past matters, and sent envoys and money to make peace with them. It was during this time that the story of Su Wu arose:</p>
<p>Su Wu, courtesy name Ziqing, was a native of Duling in Jingzhao (present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi). His father, Su Jian, was originally a military officer who had participated in several campaigns against the Xiongnu, so Su Wu had patriotic ideas from a young age.</p>
<p>This time, he was sent as an envoy to make peace with the Xiongnu, accompanied by the deputy envoy Zhang Sheng and a temporary clerk, Chang Hui, among others. They arrived in the Xiongnu territory, handed over the money to Qiedihou Chanyu, and said many friendly words. However, the Xiongnu's intention was originally to pretend to be friendly with China because they feared that China would take advantage of their mourning period to attack them. Now, seeing that China not only did not attack them, and did not bring up past matters, but even gave them a lot of money, they thought that China was afraid of them. Thus, after accepting China's gifts, Qiedihou Chanyu became greatly arrogant, which was something China did not expect!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, at this time, an incident of conspiracy to assassinate a noble Xiongnu official occurred. The facts were as follows: Several fugitives in the Xiongnu, and the Xiongnu monkey king (who had surrendered to the Han), were discussing taking advantage of the Chanyu's absence to force the Chanyu's mother to surrender to China; they also wanted to kill the Han traitor Wei Lü (Wei Lü was originally a Chinese, but later surrendered to the Xiongnu. The Chanyu liked him very much because he was good at being a traitor to China, and made him the Dingling King, giving him great power in the Xiongnu). This was to be done as a "gift" for surrendering to China. Among these people was one named Yu Chang, who was very close to the deputy envoy Zhang Sheng when he was in China, so they discussed this matter. Yu Chang wanted to involve Zhang Sheng, so Yu Chang ran to the Chinese embassy and said to Zhang Sheng: "Wei Lü has become a traitor to China and is planning things that are detrimental to the Han Dynasty in front of the Chanyu. I heard that the Han Emperor hates him very much. Because of this, I really want to kill him, but I'm afraid I don't have enough strength to carry out my plan, so I need your help. If this matter is done, wouldn't it be eliminating a great danger for the country?" Zhang Sheng listened to these words and agreed. He also gave Yu Chang a lot of money for distribution to his accomplices. The plan was set, and they just waited to carry it out.</p>
<p>A month later, the Chanyu went out hunting, leaving only the Chanyu's mother and the rest of the family behind. Yu Chang and his group thought that the time had come and planned to start the uprising that day. However, a traitor appeared among their accomplices, and secretly ran to the Chanyu's house at night to confess. The Chanyu's sons and brothers heard this news and raised troops to surround this group of people. As a result, the Monkey King and the others were completely killed, while Yu Chang was simply captured alive.</p>
<p>The Chanyu returned and handed this case entirely over to Wei Lü for trial. Zhang Sheng panicked at this time, fearing that if the matter was revealed, even the Han envoys who came to make peace would not be able to escape responsibility. So he reported the matter of Yu Chang coming to him completely to Su Wu. Su Wu listened to Zhang Sheng's words and said:</p>
<p>"Now that the facts are like this, we will certainly not be able to escape responsibility. We were originally envoys to make peace, but this time we will be killed because of the Makka Uprising's plan. This will not only betray the country's mission but also insult the country's position. Rather than being spat on, whipped, and then killed by them, it would be better to commit suicide and be done with it."</p>
<p>After Su Wu said these words, he was about to commit suicide immediately, but Zhang Sheng and Chang Hui bitterly dissuaded him. Thus, they could only wait for the misfortune to come.</p>
<p>Yu Chang could not withstand the torture and confessed to his accomplice, Zhang Sheng. When the Chanyu saw this confession, he simply wanted to vent all his anger on the Han envoys. He immediately convened a meeting of noble officials, wanting to kill all the Han envoys. However, his Left Yizhisizi King (Xiongnu royal title) did not agree with his overreaction. The Left Yizhisizi King said: "If we kill all the Han envoys just for conspiring to assassinate one Wei Lü, then what heavier punishment should we inflict if someone were to plot to assassinate the Chanyu?" So he strongly advocated not killing the Han envoys, but ordering them to surrender.</p>
<p>The Chanyu listened to the Left Yizhisizi King's words and abandoned his original intention. But because he wanted the Han envoys to surrender, he sent Wei Lü to the Han embassy to summon Su Wu. When Su Wu saw Wei Lü coming to summon him, he committed suicide with his saber. Wei Lü hurried over to snatch the saber and hugged Su Wu. Su Wu fainted. Wei Lü found a doctor. He dug a shallow pit in the ground, filled it with hot coals, and placed Su Wu on top of the pit, using the fire to roast his belly; he also pointed to his back until it bled. Only then did Su Wu wake up.</p>
<p>When the Chanyu learned of this matter, he greatly admired Su Wu's integrity—sending people twice every day, morning and evening, to inquire about Su Wu's injuries. After some days, Su Wu's injuries had healed, and the Chanyu wanted to find a way to make him surrender again.</p>
<p>On the day Yu Chang was executed, the Chanyu escorted Su Wu and Zhang Sheng to the execution ground to witness the execution, intending to use Yu Chang to intimidate them into surrendering. After Yu Chang was executed, Wei Lü, who was supervising the execution, walked up to Zhang Sheng with his sword and said loudly:</p>
<p>"Zhang Sheng conspired to assassinate a close minister of the Chanyu. According to the law, he should be executed. However, the Chanyu has an order: 'Those who surrender will be pardoned!'"</p>
<p>After he said these words, he immediately raised his sword. At this moment, Zhang Sheng truly lost face – he actually succumbed and knelt on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhang Sheng had already surrendered, so Wei Lü used the same methods to deal with Su Wu. Who knew that Su Wu originally intended to risk his life to become a model figure? He did not put life and death in his mind. So, although Wei Lü seemed as if he was about to strike with his sword, Su Wu's eyes were as if he had not seen anything.</p>
<p>Wei Lü knew that Su Wu could not be subdued by force, so he changed his approach – turning intimidation into temptation, pretending to be very intimate and sincere, and saying to Su Wu:</p>
<p>"Mr. Su! I was originally a poor man in China. Since surrendering to the Xiongnu, the Chanyu has truly treated me with 'kindness as heavy as a mountain.' He made me the Dingling King, made me command tens of thousands of soldiers and horses, and made me raise cattle and sheep all over the mountains and plains. Who doesn't envy me for being so rich and noble? Mr. Su! Mr. Su! If you surrender to the Xiongnu today, you can be like this tomorrow. Why give up your life for nothing because you don't surrender? Who will know your situation then?"</p>
<p>These were such despicable and filthy words. Of course, Su Wu still acted as if he had not heard them. Who knew that Wei Lü would not know what's what, and smiled fiendishly and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. Su! If you don't surrender today, don't regret it later. If you don't listen to me today, even if you want to see me when you regret it, you won't be able to see me!"</p>
<p>These words – especially the last two sentences – greatly insulted Su Wu. So Su Wu, who had not spoken for a long time, could not help but scold loudly at this time:</p>
<p>"Traitor! You shameless traitor! I am the envoy of the Great Han! I am an upright man! What would I see you, a traitor, for? The Kingdom of Nanyue killed Han envoys, and China slaughtered them; the King of Wan killed Han envoys, and China beheaded him; the Kingdom of Joseon killed Han envoys, and China destroyed them. If the Xiongnu kill me, it will be the time of the Xiongnu's demise. Why should I surrender?"</p>
<p>Wei Lü knew that Su Wu could never be surrendered, so he reported the process of intimidation and temptation completely to the Chanyu. When the Chanyu received his report, he admired Su Wu's personality even more. Therefore, he even more wished for him to surrender.</p>
<p>They locked Su Wu in an empty rice cellar and did not give him food for several days. Coincidentally, it snowed, and Su Wu swallowed the snow along with the felt. When they saw that he would not starve, they moved him to a deserted place in the North Sea to herd male sheep (the North Sea was the northernmost part of the Xiongnu). When he went, the Chanyu said to him fiercely: "Come back when the male sheep give birth to lambs!" – meaning that he would never be released.</p>
<p>After Su Wu arrived at the North Sea, the cold and loneliness need not be said; they sometimes deliberately made things difficult for him! Often they did not give him any food for several days. Su Wu had nothing to eat, so he had to eat some grass seeds; sometimes when he was too hungry, he would catch mice to eat. In this environment of "suffering alive," he still had to herd sheep for them; but while others were herding sheep, they usually carried a branch or whip; but Su Wu, he always carried the "节" [jié] – "节" was a token given by the emperor at that time. With this "节", it could prove that this person had really received the emperor's order. Su Wu thought that this "节" was the representative of China. So he always carried the "节", which also meant that he would never forget China!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, at this time, a military officer named Li Ling surrendered – Li Ling was ordered to attack the Xiongnu. Because he was surrounded by the Xiongnu army, he fought hard for a long time and had no way to escape. His superiors were suspicious of him, and no reinforcements arrived, so he surrendered to the Xiongnu; The Chanyu made him the Right Xiao King, and liked him very much. When he was in China, he worked with Su Wu and had a good friendship; but this time he came to the Xiongnu, he was bashful, and did not dare to see Su Wu for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Later, the Chanyu knew that Li Ling and Su Wu had a good friendship, so he wanted to use Li Ling to lure Su Wu; he also knew that Su Wu's character could not be tempted by any wealth or glory, so he also wanted to use the fact that Li Ling came from the Han Dynasty to persuade Su Wu to surrender: saying that Su Wu's family had already completely gone bankrupt, using this to change his view of the Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Li Ling received the Chanyu's order and came to the North Sea, set up wine for Su Wu; and also made a lot of very unpleasant barbaric music. The two ate and drank for a while, and Li Ling slowly said:</p>
<p>"The Chanyu knows that I have a good friendship with you, so he let me talk to you this time. Ziqing! Now, everyone knows that you can never return to the Han court; but you are making yourself suffer here, what is it for? Before I came to the Xiongnu, your older brother and younger brother both committed suicide after committing crimes; when I came, your old mother had already died; your wife is very young, and I heard that she has already married someone else: only two younger sisters, a boy, and two girls are left in the family. It has been more than ten years now, and I dare not guess whether they are still alive. But you are making yourself suffer here, what is it for?"</p>
<p>Su Wu listened to these words and said:</p>
<p>"Patriotic people usually do not care about their families. I have already decided to do this, please do not say any more nonsense."</p>
<p>Li Ling found it boring and had to put this matter aside and not talk about it. After a few days, he came to Su Wu again and said: "Ziqing! Please listen to me!"</p>
<p>When Su Wu saw him coming to persuade him to surrender again, he said very generously:</p>
<p>"I am a person who is going to die anyway. If you, Right Xiao King, must be so unrelenting, I would rather die in front of your eyes."</p>
<p>When Li Ling saw that he was so patriotic, he was so moved that he cried loudly and said:</p>
<p>"Righteous man! Righteous man! Wei Lü and I should be ashamed to death!"</p>
<p>After speaking, he wiped away his tears and left.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Later Yuan era (1998 BC), Emperor Wu of Han died. When Su Wu received this news, he cried and wailed every day; who knew that at this time, Su Wu got the chance to return to his motherland. Originally, the Xiongnu's Qiedihou Chanyu had died a few years ago, and now the ruler of the Xiongnu was his grandson, Huyan Didi Chanyu. Huyan Didi Chanyu saw that the country was declining day by day and feared that China would take advantage of this opportunity to attack them, so he wanted to be very friendly with China. At this time, Emperor Zhao of Han was on the throne in China, and he accepted his goodwill, and sent envoys to the Xiongnu.</p>
<p>When the envoy arrived at the Xiongnu, he asked about Su Wu and the others. The Chanyu said that they were already dead, and the envoy had no choice but to return home to report. The second time the Han envoy arrived at the Xiongnu, Chang Hui got the news and secretly ran to the Han embassy and reported all the facts of Su Wu's move to the North Sea to the Han envoy (Chang Hui and the others were placed under surveillance by the Xiongnu after Su Wu moved to the North Sea). When this envoy heard that Su Wu was really not dead, he was very happy; Chang Hui also taught him to only say that when the Han Emperor was hunting, he shot down a goose carrying a letter, and the letter said this. Do not explain that Chang Hui leaked it.</p>
<p>When the envoy saw the Chanyu, he used the words taught by Chang Hui to rebuke the Chanyu. The Chanyu really believed these words and immediately asked the envoy to forgive him for the sin of not telling the truth before; then he completely released Su Wu and the others.</p>
<p>On the day Su Wu returned to his country, Li Ling prepared a banquet to see him off, saying to him:</p>
<p>"Your return to the country this time is truly an unprecedented and unparalleled honor. Although there were patriotic people in ancient times, they were not as great as you. It is a pity that since I surrendered to the Xiongnu, my old mother and wife have been implicated by me and died under the sword and axe. Now, compared to you, there is really a world of difference."</p>
<p>After speaking, he cried and got up to say goodbye and went back.</p>
<p>In the spring of the sixth year of the Shiyuan era (1992 BC), Su Wu returned to Chang'an, and the emperor appointed him as an official of the Dianshuguo (the official who manages the vassal states); gave him 2 million coins: 2 qing of land; and a residence. When he went to the Xiongnu as an envoy, he was very strong; now his hair and beard have long been completely white – he has not seen his motherland for nineteen years.</p>
<p>Publishing Industry</p>
<h3>The Publishing Industry and the Reading Public (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xinzai</p>
<p>— It's Time for a Rectification Movement —</p>
<p>Publishing is a cultural undertaking, not merely the dumping of goods. Quantitatively speaking, the publishing industry in China has undoubtedly been thriving in recent years. However, besides books that have been merely moved around, rearranged, or repackaged, how many are genuinely valuable? Aside from periodicals that exhume old bones or peddle foreign wares, how many are truly meaningful? Take, for example, the writings of Zeng Guofan. Compiling a collection of the four famous ministers of the late Qing dynasty is one publication, and the complete works of Zeng Wenzheng is another. Breaking them down, there are "Family Letters of Zeng Wenzheng," "Poems and Essays," "Memorials," "Diaries," "Letters," and so on, each becoming several publications. Piecing together fragments, and cobbling together odds and ends, there are "Political Views of Zeng Wenzheng," "Economic Policies," "Critical Biographies," and so forth, also becoming several publications. Furthermore, a selected works of Zeng Wenzheng would naturally be yet another publication, a new punctuated version of the collection of Zeng Wenzheng, a vernacular annotated version of the collection of Zeng Wenzheng, and so on. One can even incorporate parts of Zeng Wenzheng's writings into another book, such as "Diaries of Famous Figures of Past Dynasties," or "Selections of Letters from the Qing Dynasty." A more clever and progressive approach, of course, would be to compile a monumental work such as "Comparative Studies of Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang," thus constituting a rich publishing industry. Speaking of modern literary writers, who doesn't edit and re-edit their own works into various forms such as collected works, complete works, selected works, selected self-collections, representative works, and so on? Magazines and periodicals currently feature mostly comics and short essays, but besides copying humorous notes, jokes, couplets, and letters from ancient texts, as well as translating Western humor, or even reprinting satirical cartoons and photos from foreign newspapers, what content is there? The development of the publishing industry is following such a pathetic path.</p>
<p>The target of the publishing industry is the reading public, which can be broadly divided into two aspects: firstly, general knowledge for enlightenment and popularization, which is the widespread movement of the publishing industry; and secondly, specialized scholarship for in-depth research, which is the progressive movement of the publishing industry. Regarding the former, China already has a satisfactory set of textbooks and a set of beautiful and good popular reading materials, aside from crudely made textbooks and absurd and obscene novels and picture books. Regarding the latter, the Chinese publishing industry is full of outlines of certain subjects, and summaries of certain subjects, but it is very difficult to find a few specialized and profound works, aside from translations. Can the Chinese publishing industry's contribution to the reading public, or rather, its contribution to culture, be considered satisfactory?</p>
<p>I believe that the publishing industry should also undergo a rigorous rectification movement, and not just rely on large discounts and large gifts to attract customers. Why not break free from the perspective of business and reflect on its own grand cultural mission? Instead of purely treating the reading public as business clients and catering to general low-level tastes as much as possible, it should assume the task of correcting readers' interests and guiding academic progress. In general reading materials, strict editing should be enforced, new and healthy meanings should be injected, aligning with the educational principles of the national crisis period, and completing the national reading movement. In specialized reading materials, valuable and meaningful monographs and research collections should be published as planned and as much as possible. Naturally, these kinds of publications are often rejected by bookstore owners from a business perspective. However, I believe that it is very possible to request government encouragement. The government, in order to promote the national cultural movement and encourage academic research, should provide appropriate assistance. As for periodicals, they should reduce the loss of will and squandering of materials and spirit, and shift towards the correct path of inspiring ambition and increasing knowledge. This view is not pedantic. During this time of national crisis, we must cherish every bit of material and spirit in order to obtain a corresponding reward. It is unimaginable that there would be any idle time or energy to relax and be humorous!</p>
<p>Facing the publishing industry, the reading public should adopt an attitude of supervision, with the principle of only reading useful books and only reading publications that are beneficial to national salvation and the country. If the reading public has such a demand, the publishing industry, which is on the supply side, will naturally be more likely to adapt.</p>
<p>In recent years, people who understand the situation of the publishing industry know that, apart from a bookstore with relatively strong financial resources, the general book industry, besides reprinting ancient books, reprinting textbooks, and compiling test question solutions, has long been in a state of dormancy, and there is really no publishing significance to speak of. In order to break through this crisis, I believe that both the reading public and the publishing industry should have an awakening, help each other, and establish a center to work together.</p>
<h3>"Reading 'China's Production Education Problem'" (1)</h3>
<p>— Baisha</p>
<p>Author: Production Education Committee of the China Education Society Publisher: The Commercial Press</p>
<p>For several years, the tide of thought on production education within the country has been surging like angry waves, flooding the entire education sector. However, the theories and implementation are subject to diverse and complex arguments, lacking systematic reports. The China Education Society, recognizing this, has specially formed the Production Education Committee to compile this book, making a significant contribution.</p>
<p>The book totals 266 pages and can be divided into two parts: the main body and the appendix. The former contains seven chapters, 117 pages, with over sixty thousand words. The latter is divided into three parts. The first part describes the implementation of production education in various countries, narrating the situations in Russia, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Japan, totaling 80 pages with fifty thousand words. The second part is an index of papers, totaling 65 pages, introducing 900 papers. The last part is an index of specialized books, introducing 17 books.</p>
<p>Now, I will selectively introduce the contents of this book as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is an introduction, first stating that China today has reached a critical juncture of survival. The entire nation should strive for the revival of the nation. And the revival of the nation depends on the transformation of education. Our country's past education was consumer education, textbook education, and statecraft education, harming the country, society, and individuals, which is a major problem today. Next, it describes the reasons for our country's poverty and distress, which are the invasion of imperialism, the remnants of feudalism, the disharmony in politics, the simplicity of economic construction, and the influence of social psychology. Production education is developed as the right remedy to achieve the goal of "saving the country by first saving the poor, and educating the people by first teaching them to become rich."</p>
<p>Chapter 2 is a history of the development of production education, divided into three stages. The infancy stage began at the end of the Guangxu period with the "General Rules for Industrial Schools" issued by the Ministry of Education. The development stage began in 1926 when Xu Chongqing published a draft of education policy, advocating that production education be included in the education policy. The mature stage is when production education was stipulated as an education policy, from hope to practice, and the government also issued implementation measures for production education, and the implementation in various places also rose like a storm.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 is the meaning and goal of production education. Opinions vary, but its meaning includes the following:</p>
<h3>Bookstore Miscellany (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>4.  Submitting News—The so-called "Bookstore X's book has reached the Xth edition, and is very popular," etc., in the news columns of daily newspapers, are merely advertisements submitted by the bookstores themselves.</p>
<p>5.  Book Reviews or Book Introductions—Except for the "Book Review Monthly" edited by Liu Yingshi in the past and a few magazines such as "Cultural Construction" and "China Rural Monthly," most of the so-called book reviews are actually advertisements. The methods of submitting these advertisements vary. Some authors use pseudonyms to write and submit articles, some ask others to write and submit articles, and some write themselves and ask the editor or other celebrities to add a name for publication. It is said that some bookstores even pay to take over the book review column of magazines and submit their own manuscripts for publication. This situation is actually not surprising. Don't you see special issues of some schools and news of some companies in the newspapers, which seem to be reports from third parties in form, but are actually another form of advertisement disguised as advertising fees? Similarly, bookstores, as commercial organizations, naturally also have the right to deceive readers with advertisements.</p>
<p>6.  Writing Prefaces—The prefaces of the so-called celebrities and scholars are all the same in praising each other and are merely advertisements.</p>
<p>7.  Celebrity Articles—This is mainly limited to magazines.</p>
<p>8.  Scholarships, Reading Clubs—As long as you see that these are initiated by a certain bookstore, will anyone not read the books of the bookstore? Even if it is not directly initiated by the bookstore, the bookstore also takes advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many other methods, depending on the means used by each bookstore, such as commendations from government offices, recommendations from certain organizations, etc., which are mostly the result of bookstore lobbying. (End)</p>

<h3>How to Make Use of Spring Break?</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Traveling is a pleasure, as everyone knows. However, the meaning of traveling is not only to wander among mountains and rivers; traveling can train the body and mind and increase experience. As the saying goes, "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times," which is exactly the principle.</p>
<p>Traveling also contains a profound educational meaning. Countries such as England, America, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Soviet Russia are actively promoting this educational movement. The most notable is school travel in Germany. All universities, middle schools, and elementary schools can participate. Elementary school students have one week or ten days each semester to travel along rivers and forests. University and middle school students go to neighboring countries to investigate natural, political, economic, social, educational, humanistic, and geographical conditions. As for Japan's tourist groups, Italy's Ballia members, and Soviet Russia's Young Pioneers, all have regular travel organizations, which shows the importance of travel in education.</p>
<p>In recent years, schools in various parts of our country have also promoted travel. In addition to free outings for visits, the Ministry of Education also stipulates a spring break of one week starting on April 1st each year. This year, universities and middle schools will hold it as scheduled, while elementary schools will postpone it to April 5th. Below is a travel organization plan that we can implement:</p>
<p>Social Survey Group: Designate a location and conduct a brief survey of its population, wealth, land, production, customs, habits, and construction for reference.</p>
<p>Education Inspection Group: Designate a location to inspect its schools and social education, paying attention to its equipment, funding, buildings, faculty, students, grades, and extracurricular activities, and be sure to note its characteristics.</p>
<p>Economic Observation Group: Whether in rural areas or cities, one can observe its production, consumption, the flow of goods, and the turnover of finance, etc.</p>
<p>Specimen Collection Team: Whether biological or mineral, one can collect and make specimens for daily research.</p>
<p>Photography Practice: Those who are interested in photography can take advantage of this holiday to go to places with beautiful scenery and practice photography, learn from each other, and benefit both body and mind and skills.</p>
<p>Boy Scout Military Training Camping: Camp in various places, on the one hand, you can practice group life, on the other hand, you can learn about nature and common sense on things.</p>
<p>Women's Sightseeing Group: Urban women go to the countryside, and rural women go to the city, learning from each other and exchanging knowledge.</p>
<p>The above seven types are basic travel organizations, which can be changed according to the situation. Attention should be paid to the following matters in the plan, such as the purpose, funding, team members, and application objects, which should be identified and prepared in advance. It is good for people with money or companions to travel, but it is always better to join a group travel, because in group travel, there are many people, the cost is saved, and you can publicly visit agencies, factories or schools, and you can also take care of each other. If you can invite faculty to participate, the interest will be even stronger.</p>
<h3>The Garden Owner</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>"Uncle Luoshui," I shouted.</p>
<p>"Have you eaten yet? I haven't seen you for several days."</p>
<p>Uncle Luoshui asked with a kind smile. Then we sat on a stone bench under the grape trellis, which had become dilapidated and only had tangled dead vines. We didn't need to start talking right away, but instead enjoyed savoring or chewing on each other's thoughts and the scenery in front of us in silence. My eyes were greedily appreciating the sunset, which was changing into various strange colors towards the clusters of trees. Uncle Luoshui just kept puffing on his dry tobacco pipe. When things in the distance were completely swallowed by the evening mist, he retracted his gaze. A dim soybean oil lamp in the thatched cottage suddenly lit up. I realized that Uncle Luoshui had left me sometime and gone to light it. On the way out, he said:</p>
<p>"It's just September, and the days are getting shorter like this."</p>
<p>Except for the dim lamp shining a weak cone of light from the house, the entire surrounding area was shrouded in darkness. The dog seemed to have gone to bed early. Unnamed insect sounds gradually became dense and noisy, coming from the nearby pond and grass stalks. Uncle Luoshui sat back on the stone bench and suddenly said in a tone of emotion:</p>
<p>"These past few nights, people have been coming to the garden to steal bamboo shoots. I know what those idle bad guys are doing. They are bullying me for being old, thinking I have no way to stop them. Actually, I'm just relaxing a bit, not wanting them to become more and more daring." Then he said again:</p>
<p>"Life is hard for everyone, but these bad guys have strength but don't look for work, and prefer to take the wrong path. Young people are not used to enduring hardship, are greedy and lazy, and everyone is willing to be useless. I have lived this long and have seen through everything. But I have never seen young people as cowardly and powerless as they are now."</p>
<p>"But you can't let them keep stealing," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I haven't slept almost all night for the past two days. Okay, I'm specifically waiting for them, but 'thieves steal for one watch, guards guard for one night'..."</p>
<p>It was getting late. I said goodbye to the owner and walked out of the garden gate. Fortunately, the moon was shining brightly on the ground, saving me from groping in the dark. It was easy to leave, but my mind was suddenly very gloomy. I was savoring Uncle Luoshui's words just now. I thought of him spending the long years alone in this garden, not lonely at all. In the long years, his footsteps seemed to have never stepped out of the gate. This was probably why he resented the continuing vulgar world of people. So when his wife died at the age of fifty, he simply abandoned everything, went alone to this riverbank, built a thatched cottage, surrounded it with a low bamboo fence, and resolved to isolate himself from all entanglements, spending the rest of his life in such a lonely environment. ...</p>
<p>"But even these days, he can't live well."</p>
<p>Uncle Luoshui must have such sighs and indignation. Because now someone often comes to steal things that he has worked hard to grow. I know that if he is stolen of a day's bamboo shoots, he will be short of a day's worth of vegetables.</p>
<p>In the years that I have been away from my hometown, I have always cherished the old and gentle garden owner, Uncle Luoshui. Recently, after several years, I finally heard a piece of bad news:</p>
<p>—Uncle Luoshui died one winter night. People didn't find out until a few days later because people didn't go to that place very often.</p>
<p>Someone from the countryside told me. I was a little sad. Uncle Luoshui lived so lonely and went back so lonely!</p>
<h3>Fall</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>The early spring sunlight spread gently on the streets. The sharp cold wind was gone. Mr. Ziyu felt a little warm on his body in the midst of half a day's busyness, but a layer of anxiety and worry that could not be wiped away clung to his heart. This feeling slowly solidified and continued to grow. In the end, it made him feel a kind of confusing blur and incomprehensibility about everything: This era is strange, this world is incomprehensible, everything is blurry, career is like this, life is like this, and fate is like this.</p>
<p>"In short, our days are over—I believe, I said so long ago—any terrible fate—poverty, hunger, or death—let it come if it wants to come!"</p>
<p>Filled with worry and anxiety, Mr. Ziyu returned blankly to that dark room called "home" (where there existed a woman who knew nothing but giving birth to children, and four children as bad as wild boars, constantly resentful and noisy, in that filthy, small, and dark "home"). The children were constantly shouting, and a burst of stuffy heat rose up. He impatiently took off an old woolen hat from his head and threw it resentfully towards the dirty bed in the corner of the room. Looking at his wife who was in a daze, he said hatefully, "Failed again! I can't live this life anymore, we are finished! We——"</p>
<p>His wife was still blankly in a daze. Mr. Ziyu sighed helplessly. That feeling, whether it was sadness or numbness, sank deeply and fell into the grindstone of contemplation again. Thoughts were constantly being ground, being ground...</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Ziyu felt more and more clearly day by day; he himself was "indeed" in decline, falling. A person like "him" will definitely not have much of a "day" to live in "our" era, without a doubt. In his fifties, knowing a little bit of writing, having read a little bit of the books of "sages," having had a little bit of a not-so-"bad" (at least, peaceful) life, having a "home" that was nothing but a burden like a snail shell… Thus, the waves of the era moved forward at an alarming speed. The outside world was modern, scientific, and sociological; but the inner "person" was still eighteenth-century Eastern, religious, and spiritual… Gradually, Mr. Ziyu began to worry about the decline of life: the outside world was too enterprising and too young; and he himself was really too incompetent and too old: This era was no longer theirs—their</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>their incompetent "indifferent and quiet" era had gone far away—far away, like the old sunset wind.</p>
<p>The leisurely days of indifference and quietness had been gone for a long time, and the world had become so bad that "drifting along" had become impossible. To go out and do things, it is said that you need a "big face," you need to know a little bit of "socializing," you need foreign languages... but he is so far away from these. The iron hand of life held him tightly without loosening for a second, and what followed was day after day of worry, day after day of running around, day after day of disappointment…</p>
<p>"Our days are over," Mr. Ziyu thought, "and I am already in my fifties, and it can be over..."</p>
<p>However, what about that ignorant woman and a group of children belonging to the future world...?—Thinking of this, Mr. Ziyu felt a little moist in his eyes; from himself he saw their fate: they will also be undoubtedly submerged by the waves of the era; undoubtedly, like a star that is permanently dim, falling, falling…</p>
<p>"Falling!" He dared not think anymore, this tragedy had ground him enough. He raised his head blankly: the early spring sun outside shone so brightly that his eyes blurred.</p>
<h3>Sister-in-law Lu Er</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Escaping from Shenyang, lonely and frightened, I walked step by step along the steel rails of the Jihai Road, which had been destroyed by disaster, towards my hometown. The mountains and fields in September were panting with fury. Lush forests and weeds were growing in the turbulent season. I grabbed the railway tunnels, I climbed the deep and steep valleys, I stepped on the narrow plains. In a small inn in Fushun, I was inspected once. In the deep night, I was led to a courtyard drizzled by autumn rain, silently kneeling towards the boundless darkness. The next day, I glanced sadly at the一面面 the sun flag hanging high in the city, and I was running my course again. When I arrived at Hailong, it was not far from my hometown. In just two more days, I could end my journey. Unexpectedly, before I reached Chaoyang Town, I heard that the war had started in front of me three days ago, so I changed my route and walked straight towards the Niuxindingzi Mountain peak in my hometown, which was looming in the smoke.</p>
<p>My hometown, a discolored hometown, is now in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>On the third day of returning home, I went to the countryside. The place was called Dongyang Fort, which was sixty miles away from the city. There was a distillery factory run by my father. My father lived in the factory all year round. But now the chimney of the factory no longer spews black smoke. Therefore, my father painfully knocked on the table with his tobacco pipe every day. The days were getting more and more chaotic. The train was still sleeping, and there was no trace of freight cars on the road. The factory's wine was stored in the warehouse in large vats. More than eighty workers would not let my father breathe every day. They were demanding two months of unpaid wages. My father was often forced to ask me to come forward and negotiate with the workers when he had no way to think. But what can I do? I just told my father to think of a way to get some money as soon as possible. . . . . . . . . . also nothing. My (words) did not relieve my father's pain. He still couldn't think of a way to deal with them. In this way, the workers really had no patience. Everyone was speaking a series of rude words and arguing with their father.</p>
<p>—You, as the manager, must know the difficulties of us workers...</p>
<p>—We have wives and children, and we have to eat...</p>
<p>—Now the situation is so unstable, you can't trap us here.</p>
<p>These are their words.</p>
<p>My father was anxious and angry with me.</p>
<p>One day, a woman in her thirties ran in from outside. This woman was the wife of worker Lu Xiang, and people called her Sister-in-law Lu Er. She barged into my father's room, breathing heavily, pointing her finger at my father's face, and nagging angrily: "...I'm here to ask you for wages. You can't use people for nothing. You also have sons and daughters, and you have to have a conscience. Our whole family is starving. Hurry up, hurry up, you can't not give it today..."</p>
<p>My father was speechless. He asked me to close the door and asked me to see if there was anyone outside the window. He glared his eyes like a ghost and whispered to Sister-in-law Lu Er: "I can think of a way for you, but you can't tell anyone. Otherwise, I won't be able to deal with so many people." As he spoke, my father took out several banknotes from his waist and gave them to her.</p>
<p>That night, except for the absence of Lu Xiang's shadow, the eighty-plus workers crowded into my father's room like crazy. My father had already been dragged to the ground by them. The room was filled with a clamor.</p>
<p>—Lu Xiang's wife is good-looking, why give him wages and not us?</p>
<p>—Did you drink Lu Er's rice soup?</p>
<p>In a few minutes, my father had already agreed to pay them wages.</p>
<p>The factory was dead silent.</p>
<p>After staying for a few days, I returned to the city. Soon, Dongyang Fort was also a line of fire. My father fled back to the city and said: Lu Xiang is dead.</p>
<p>When I二决 went to Dongyang Fort, the distillery factory run by my father had been destroyed. Under the desolate mountains, a pile of debris like hills was piled high on the small plain.</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything worth remembering there.</p>
<p>However, when I remember Lu Xiang, who died in the line of fire, and the shadow of his abandoned Sister-in-law Lu Er, they began to be active in my mind. Where, where did she and her children go? My heart is empty.</p>

<p>A woman oppressed and abused by her husband.</p>
<p>It was about nine or ten o'clock. She was sitting along the window in the (house), and a dim kerosene lamp was shining on her haggard face. She was thinking deeply.</p>
<p>A doctor was knocking on her door. However, she was extremely afraid. She didn't want him to come in. She knew very well that it would be very disadvantageous for the doctor if her husband came back. However, the doctor insisted. She had no choice but to open the door.</p>
<p>The doctor cherished her very much. He saw the pain of the burns that Mulan had been烫 done by her husband with a red-hot fire. He wanted to take her away from this family. He wanted her to leave this hell.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, her husband came back drunk. —A man who used his wife as a vent for anger,烫 burned his own daughter to death for no reason, and was also committing a crime of instigating the bombing of a mine shaft, killing twenty or thirty workers. —Dick.</p>
<p>He ordered his wife to take off his boots for him. Because she was a little slow! He cursed again. … Suddenly, he discovered the doctor on the side. So, the two people quarreled.

Because he was afraid of being caught, he finally did not wait until the doctor's hand检响 went off, he blew 声 life with a bottle of explosives.</p>

<p>……Act One……</p>
<p>The people in the Zhou Mansion are furnished luxuriously. The old servant of the Zhou family—Lu Gui is with his daughter—Si Feng. She is also a maid of the Zhou family. Because she is clever and lively, she is loved by the eldest young master of the Zhou family—Zhou Xue. Her father knows this, so he often uses this to blackmail his daughter for money. At this moment, he is talking about this. …Si Feng is frying medicine for his wife—Zhou Fanyi to eat, and is annoyed by his nagging.</p>
<p>Lu Gui's son—Dahai, due to his father's recommendation, works as a foreman on the mine of the old master—Zhou Puyuan. He is very stubborn and honest. The miners went on strike three or two days ago. The workers asked him to represent them to request their director (that is, Zhou Puyuan) to comfort the工友 who were beaten to death or injured by the police. At this time, he walked in to see the director, but he was ordered by Lu Gui—his father to wait in the doorway because there was a guest inside.</p>
<p>Isn't Si Feng said to be loved by the eldest young master? However, his younger brother Zhou Chong also loves her. He shouted Si Feng all the way in the garden: Si Feng, come in quickly. His father heard it in the next room, but he went back with an uninteresting complaint. Si Feng stood up from the hiding place and was about to take the medicine upstairs. His wife had already walked downstairs.</p>
<p>Zhou Fanyi is a "traditional Chinese woman." She is "哀静", "明慧", "likes poetry". ……</p>
<p>His son Zhou Chong walked up slowly. When he saw his mother, he had to reveal his love for Si Feng, but this intention did not get a response from his mother. His mother has not seen his brother Zhou Ping for a long time, so the mother and son talked about him. He also felt that his brother's feelings for his mother were not as good as before. He said "a woman who should not be loved was loved before" as his brother's end to his talk to him, and the mother finally fell into the pain of recollection by this sentence. The "woman who should not be loved" that his brother thought was Fanyi—his mother two or three years ago.</p>
<p>While they were talking, Zhou Chong looked back at the door, and his brother Zhou Ping also walked in. His face was pale. Recently, he was simply afraid of seeing his mother. Although he had just come, he wanted to push off writing a letter and wanted to leave her—he even decided to leave this family and go to the mine.</p>
<p>I said earlier that Zhou Puyuan was not meeting guests? Now that he has seen the guests off, he also walked to the hall, and his wife and children are there.</p>
<p>His character is that whatever he says must be done. When he firmly通forced his two sons to hold his mother and force her to take the medicine, everyone left unhappily with painful tears. ……End of Act One……</p>

To obey the orders of the old Madam Cui. Especially setting up a temple in the meditation room. To commemorate the death anniversary of the late Prime Minister. Please have the monks pray for his ascent to the Western Paradise. The fifteenth auspicious day to worship the Dharma King. After speaking, she wants to leave but stops.

I am, Zhang Junrui, a talented scholar from Luoyang. I am using the monastery as a study for marriage. Please report to the Rui Zhu Palace. Say that I, do not yet have a wife at home. Hongniang listened. Her face changed. What the gentleman says is too absurd. It has been said since ancient times that one should not speak impolitely. Scholars should cherish their reputation. The old madam holds a frosty virtue. Even a three-foot-tall servant is not allowed to enter the central hall. Talking about what the maid has heard can be forgiven. If the madam finds out, she will hate it very much. From now on, think carefully before speaking.</p>

<p>Grand Light Screening</p>
<h3>Waves Washing Sand Will Be Performed</h3>
<p>Chinese film themes, due to the influence of various aspects, are increasingly feeling dry, which is an obvious fact. Under these circumstances, "Waves Washing Sand" can be said to be a film that explores new themes.</p>
<p>"A good person will commit crimes in accidental and unfortunate encounters; a law-abiding detective is always pursuing the criminals he wants to arrest. When the two of them stand on the same lifeline, they will abandon their hostility and become the noblest friendship, but once they encounter conflicts of interest and the agitation of human desires, they will immediately restore their hostility. This kind of tragedy is always produced between people."</p>
<p>This new type of script can be said to be a stroke of genius, and it is also Wu Yonggang's meticulous masterpiece in pursuit of "Goddess" and "Little Angel."</p>
<p>It starts with the psychology of human beings and writes a tragedy containing infinite philosophical meaning, which can cause a personal spiritual touch to every viewer.</p>
<p>Not only is Jin Yan's role as a criminal particularly successful, but also Zhang Zhizhi, who had amazing success in "Goddess", has a fuller display of his beautiful personality here.</p>
<p>This film will be performed soon.</p>

<p>The "Flower of Spring" symposium has been held, and among the attendees were "Wanqiu Xiong" and others who were "not involved." The full text can be seen in tonight's Da Wan Bao.</p>
<p>After the "symposium," I hope Mr. Wu Cun will have a real "self-criticism" that we can see.</p>
<p>A certain newspaper that is electing the Second Film Queen has recently sent mimeographed letters to newspapers and film-related people.</p>
