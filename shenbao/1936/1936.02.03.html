<h3 id="c27">上年度之我國對外貿易 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 育</p>
<p>我國去年之對外貿易在數字上頗有漸趨好轉之傾向據海關統計去年全年洋貨進口凈値爲九一九，二一一，三二二元較前年的减少百分之一〇·八土貨出口凈値爲五七五，八〇九，〇六〇元較前年的增加百分之七·五進出口總額爲一，四九五，〇二〇，二八二元較前年减少百分之四·五進出口貿易差額爲入超三四三，四〇二，二六二元則較前年的减少百分之三十全年對外貿易情形以十二月份爲最佳進口値六千五百餘萬元出口値七千餘萬元貿易差額爲出超五百餘萬元構成近數十年來我國對外貿易上稀有之現象</p>
<p>然究其實際上述情形似尙未足令入樂觀蓋去年貿易數字上之所以好轉並非由於國內產業之進步與乎貿易技術上之改善實乃一般人民購買力之低减及中外間之種種糾紛有以致之而我國政府在十一月份開始實行之新貨幣政策將外匯相當提高便利輸出而阻難輸入亦爲去年十二月份貿易出超之重大原因茲再就去年進出口主要商品情形觀之進口方面較前年增加者僅食糧機器及五金紙木材金屬製品雜貨等項其中允以食糧之進口數字爲最巨他如棉製品毛製品車輛船舶煤油糖菸草等一律低减出口方面增加最大者爲仔仁與植物油决爲牲畜棉花生絲蛋類等項茶葉皮革棉製品匹頭等則皆大降落斯可知一般人民購買力已達山窮水盡之際故輸入者多屬政府從事經濟建設與人民維持最低生活程度所需要之資料卽用以掉換此類資料之輸出商品其重心亦離製造品及農業正產品而趨於農業副產品矣</p>
<p>至就中外間之糾紛對於我國對外貿易之關係而言自滿洲華北等事變發生後我國海關行政主權屢遭外人破壊在發生事變區域內之海關或被强占或被監視卽在事變區域以外者亦常遭受外人之武力干涉去年某國以兵艦水兵保護浪人經營走私已成爲公開之秘密汕頭潮州天津及長城各口之私運糾紛報章上亦已屢載此種未經海關登記之秘密輸入殆遠過於海關貿易報吿册中所减少之進口數字也</p>
<p>總之我國對外貿易現距眞正好轉之期尙遠嗣後若圖改善則恢復人民購買力推廣海外市塲與振興國內實業諸端固應加以努力而國家領土與主權之保持完整允爲必要之先决條件也</p>

<p>— 中國科學社編　李寅恭</p>
<p>歐美人慣尊重國際法與友邦相互間契的，允恪守所謂外交上信條。若涉及軍事上航空設備，飛翔起訖，率有常規，不得越雷池一步，所以避誤會，免失禮也。吾國北部時被外人航空隊欄入逡巡，作軍事演習，已非一决。抗議聲雖數有所聞，彼恃强橫行者，乃悍然不顧。其用心叵測可以想見。故謀自衛者為未雨綢繆計，不得不亟亟植樹以資防禦。作者偶檢案頭某報，　　美紐的城一部之鳥瞰攝影，取載　後　籍示他國樹木森森之市容。</p>
<p>吾國各省都會，向少樹木，小邑更無論焉。予昔寓居安慶，每値冬春必藉文字宣傳，某决標題曰，「鳥飛不下之安慶。」用語諷刺，所以促人省悟。昔康南海遊開封，刋其題詠於被處鐵塔云云，「遠望高寒頫汴州，繁臺鐵塔與雲浮。萬家無樹無宮闕，但見黃河滾滾流。」其致慨之意，亦可見一斑。今當外患頻仍之際，凡城廂附近區域，植樹防空，似屬萬難坐誤之一事。從十二月以至二月問，正一年造林之大好時期。凡本產喬木種類（快長性者允妙），無不可為點綴風景之用。</p>
<p>今不妨聯想及於郊外。在秋老霜降之村路中，大概樵子占行人之過半數。車挽肩負，罔非山草與野生小樹，混同被刈，入市售之，以當柴薪。其中雜樹頗多由一寸至二寸直徑者，若任其保存三五年，卽不難蔚然成林。村人伐樹燒炭，雖就五七寸直徑之樹伐之，亦所不惜。嗟乎。吾國一日無林政，此風焉望其息北。若執　人而語以植樹防空，彼必引以為誰語。庸詎知一切野生樹，卽重林國家天然林之所依倚，為最省事之培養法，而不虞病蟲害與水旱災也。試取首都烏龍山一帶野生樹之被保護者，其百分率之調查如下：</p>
<p>率九二九五五〇五五五五五五分六四七六〇一〇〇〇〇〇〇百六一野生樹名麻櫟白樂化香山槐烏桕黃檀楓香榔榆君遷子臭椿靑朴三角楓</p>
<p>右表所列狀况，概知首都附近天然樹種之成分。如為首都防空造林，卽可用之為基本樹種。其他各地，亦不妨取以為例。予於此得而鄭重建議曰：欲事防空，必須栽樹。城區地方，每戶如栽植五至十株，則此目的可達。蒭蕘之見，認是最簡便最經濟之自救救國辦法。來日大難，無可倖免。若行此而减少風鶴之警，則為作者區區之願望也。</p>

<p>— 衡之</p>
<p>——作爲「非常時」中戰爭準備的過渡——</p>
<p>社大黨主張「重要產業的國營」，第一「先行國內的改革」。他們的中心政綱如下：</p>
<p>（一）勤勞議會政治之建設</p>
<p>（二）大衆的增稅之反對</p>
<p>（三）國民年金制之卽時實行</p>
<p>（四）民衆工商金庫之設置</p>
<p>（五）重要產業之國營化</p>
<p>（六）農產損失之國家補償</p>
<p>社大黨的中心口號是：</p>
<p>（一）先行國內改革</p>
<p>（二）民衆富足國防才能安全</p>
<p>（三）過去呢？未來呢？已成政黨呢？大衆黨呢？</p>
<p>他們估量各時地的情勢，適當地選用這些口號。初選雖未得過十名，但已證明有十數萬的勤勞大衆擁護他們了。當然，在「非常時」局面下，議會競爭的前途也是很有限的。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>在「舉國一致」的現內閣及民政黨的口號下，事實與宣傳，自然有許多的不一致；「肅正選舉」的反面卽就有着「不肅正」。這在資本主義國是無法消滅的問題。</p>
<p>看了以上各黨派的政策和口號，顯示在我們面前的是：</p>
<p>（一）政友會顯然代表一部份金融資本家的現階段的意志：產業國防兩全。在這一點上，雖則民政黨甚且喊着國防·產業·財政·三全，但從民政黨是現內閣與黨一點看來，這主張當不及政友會有力，並且也含着多少成份上的差異。因自滿洲事變以來，日本地盤，勿論經濟·政治·軍事·都已擴大了。但軍事地盤的擴大較快，要在此擴大了的地盤上將已有的深根培養雄厚，則金融資本的某些部份，自必希望能有一個較長的安定時期。若這較長的安定時期沒有，則不但資本的利潤不充分，卽軍事費增加的負擔也就不容易取償。這增重的負擔旣未能呌殖民地全部分受，只好將一部份加在國內勞動大衆的身上。然而，在目前，除軍需工業外，並無十分景氣的時候，加重大衆負擔，是就會燃起國內問題的。所以，卽使也用「非常時」的別名「重大時局」，但也不能不唱「國防產業兩全」。</p>
<p>（二）在反法西一點上社大黨喊出這口號，民政黨也公然定爲政綱之一。政友會是避免這一正面衝突的。但政友及民政都一樣主張議會政治，所以也就有幾分反法西的實質和外表。滿洲事變以來，多種多樣的法西傾向逐漸顯明；但統一的法西黨，還未能完全形成。這也就是說，由某派金融資本煽動起來的小布爾大衆運動的法西主義，在日本尙未充分形成。然而從此决競選中有幾派喊出的反法西口號上看來，法西的勢力也就不小了；同時也就可以看出他的軍事力量。</p>
<p>（三）從國民同盟所標榜的日本主義看來，更從他主張軍事行動和外交行動之一致看，這顯然是針對着以外各黨派說的。但他並不要說自己是法西。然而他主張日本大陸政策之强化則無疑。固然，目前看來，他能被選的人數至多未必超過二三十人。</p>
<p>（四）引起各方注意的，是無產陣營的社大黨參加競選。無產黨在德意志等國的議會鬭爭，是曾經有了不少成功及失敗之敎訓的。在表示勞動集團的某方面的意志，爭取公開的宣傳等意義上，允其公開表示反法西這一意義上，當然足以引起各方的視綫。其實，法西的勢力從官吏起，便是在一部份勞動羣衆中也已經被浸入。「勤勞議會政治之建設」，在目前縱不能够產生，但也可以這樣喊着。「反對大衆的增稅」，或有幾分效力。「重要產業國營化」——這是會被利用爲國家經濟之軍事統制的吧。總之，這應看做他們目前可能有的公開運動。在他們的一個口號上「先實行國內改革」，這就是與其他各派最不同的所在。</p>
<p>（五）雖然二月二十日的總選還未到，但下决的議會及內閣，已可據目前競選的形勢作大致的推測。國民同盟·昭和會·社大黨·等在四百六十六的規定議席中，此决至多能佔六十來席吧。因國民同盟及昭和會是最擁護政府—允其國民同盟是擁護軍部的，議席當有增加的趨勢。爭取第一黨的是目前的政友會和民政黨。初選時，民政黨少於政友會二三十席，此决因着現內閣的助力，正努力超越政友會，事實上也確有幾分超過的可能。但形勢已略定，此二大黨的議席决不至於十分相差。此二大黨本是一母（日本資本主義）所生，誰執政都相差不遠。不過，民政黨若得多數席，這於現內閣的面子要光彩些。但若不聽軍部百分之五十以上指揮，也就辦不到，所以，所謂反法西也就等於自己反自己了。政友會若佔多數，內閣自然無面子地倒塌，但政友會標出的改革，比起目前的內閣來，並沒有甚麼根本的大差異。而且，耍不和軍部調協，卽使成立政友內閣，也是維持不久的。日本的軍部與各國的軍部有一根本不同點，卽是：軍部的獨自性。例如，可以不經外交部便能獨自進行外交。在軍專秘密的名義下，軍部可以直上奏於最高主權者。至於軍部的羣衆，『在鄉軍』及『靑年團』就很不少，而且具有幾許左右民間中小市民層的實力。所以在此『非常時』，勿論政友勝，民政勝，都不得不看着軍部的眼色做事。至於下决之內閣，也勿論政友勝或民政勝，內閣人選是不能不與軍部有密切關係的。若無密切關係便沒有較長時期存在的可能。假使國民同盟的席數增多，那卽表明『日本主義』抬頭，『大陸政策』必然强化的，同時軍部意志之遂行也就更有基礎。不過，照目前看來，此派的席數還不至於超過政友或民政。社大黨的高度發展，目前當不可能。而且，一有相當發展，卽至於被分化以至被鎮壓，那也是無疑義的。</p>
<p>總之，目前還是很沈悶，如大風雨將來時。其沈悶的程度恰如似乎景氣而實未見得怎樣景氣的經濟現狀一樣。</p>
<p>此决總選結果，不過能表示各層戰綫的更進一步的劃淸。要衝破沈悶是不可能的。到衝破沈悶時，那必是戰爭臨頭了。現在還只在積極準備戰爭的階段上。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>意阿問題未解决，軍縮會議失敗，德國正在要求返還殖民地；在這時期，日本要求列强承認他爲束亞安定的中心勢力，自必是最好的機會，報載蘇聯人民委員長莫托洛夫演說，謂日德已進行同盟。最近廣田外相演說，除所謂「對支三大原則」外，且要求蘇聯撤退遠東近年增加了的軍隊；在軍事以外，同時並主張自由貿易，反對各國的貿易限制。此種自由貿易的主張，表示在不景氣的今日，日本生產指數業巳向上。也正因此，其對外政策敢於强硬。就爲了這兩重關係，此决的競選，各派自然以『國防』和『產業』作爲政爭的口號。</p>
<p>日本目前正在軍事的政治經濟統制發展過渡中，今回的選舉足以表示更進一步的邁進。同時，各層勢力的實質也就逐漸呈現了出來。（完）</p>

<p>現行施振方法，爲先查後放，查放人員携欵到達一縣後，着由地方行政人員，造具災民淸冊，由區報縣，由縣彙集。查放員收到淸冊，再行按冊逐戶覆查，同時發給振票，選定日期地點，由災民持票領振，經此手續完畢，振欵乃入災民手中。計開指派查放人員，匯寄振欵，運輸振品，爲時已屬不短，而編製淸冊，按冊覆查，需時允多，按之已往經騐，在交通便利之處，已非二三個月，不能竣事，共他交通阻寨之地，更無論矣。然而淸冊是吾確實，覆查有無朦蔽，俱堪疑慮。近來報章什誌，關於農村救災之　圖小說，常有對於現行辦法之公正與時效方面，有頗不原諒之表示者，此爲一般忠實的反應，辦振之人，理應鄭重注意，而求方法之改進也。貝克君所言之工振方法，自可認爲此較省時而公平之方法，旣可免却調查之繁，及其流弊，並在救活生命之外，同時可有積極的建設之功果，此後自應儘量採行以代舊法之急振，但此種工振計劃，必先預爲籌謀，然後在災難發生之後，卽刻可使實施，决非如現在所謂工振，乃在災難發生之後，支配得有的欵，而後測量設計，召工實施，不獨取時較急振爲久，而召致客民，轉至有擾農之嫌者可此。貝克君所言之工振，以意度之，當由中央與地方建設機關，將各地方三四年內應辦建設工程，逐年預爲核定，製成預算，如遇豐年，則按序徵工或催工完成之，如遇荒年，則卽可按序提前開工，以災工完成之，若是則國家有一元建設預算，卽是有一元振災預算，救災可促成建設，建設可同時救災，是工振之所以爲可取也。</p>
<h3 id="c91">二曰振欵之調度也 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>振欵之最後散放，由查放員執行，查放員或因本人缺乏能力，或因種種公私原因，携欵不放，或放不得其道，不合其時者，則該部份之振欵，卽失其價值矣。是故振欵欲調配適當，運用靈活，中心機關，不論其爲政府機關，抑或人民團體，應得對於振欵，始終有統制之權，監督之力。振欵之全部，經支配後，不應一决撥出，應取逐用逐撥之方法，以取得管轄調劑之功用。貝克君之所議，要係本乎經騐，鑑于歷來各團體機關辦振，撥欵容易，結賬困難，常拖延至二三年以上之故，此流言之所以興起，而信仰之所以失也，貝克君之方法，簡言之，卽會計上定額週轉金制爾。此制旣已行之于各商業及行政機關，對於賑欵之度支，未見其不可同樣採用也。</p>
<h3 id="c92">三曰最高機關之組織 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>主持全國振務中央最高之機關，對於多災多難之中國，其行政上所負之責任，較之其他機關或更重大，欲求充分發揮其機能，以盡其責職，自應有充足之經費，與專門之人才爲前提。今日財政支絀，各部會雖在盡量緊縮，獨此機關，以吾國特殊之情形，需要之殷切，應得另當別論。但受命負責之官吏，允應體會使命之重大，而鄭重於職務之授受，使公帑不至於虛耗。中國一般行政機關之弊病，卽經費不足則一事不辦，徙供點綴，如經費充足，則忙於安置閒員，依然不成一事，此種現狀願將來不見諸於振務行政機關，以振務與其他行政關係之密切，爲行政便利起見，最高級之長官，自應以年高德碩，資望深厚之士任命之。而其幹部之人員，則必量材取用，另以富有救災之經騐，熱忱，學問，體力，能耐勞苦，能進取，不苟且，不畏難，專任致志之人員以爲其領袖。貝克顧問之結論曰，如中國有相當之振災領袖，則中國救災之能力可母遜於世界任何國家云，吾人深信之。</p>

<p>— 任孟閑</p>
<p>（二十五年一月九日十一日對全國中等校學生講）</p>
<p>「算學」這個學科，在學校裹——尤其在中學校裹，雖向來爲人所重視，雖經過敎師及學生諸君甚大的努力，但其成績的表現，從統計報吿上看來，還是不良，並且有人說是最壞。又如近年各省市中學會考，以及各大學招考新生，其成績計算的結果，總以算學一科較爲惡劣。這是什麼綠故呢？是誰的責任呢？關於省市會考及大學招生的問題，不屬於這個講演的範圍，它們的得失是非，自應別論，若僅就中學本身，探討算學成績所以不良的原因，及其責任所在，當有敎師及學生兩方面，現在先講我所欲貢獻於學生諸君的話：</p>
<p>據我所知，某某中學校嘗有多數學生，（有些學校竟是大多數）對於算學一科，感覺乏味。因乏味，於是不努力；因不努力，成績於是愈趨愈壞；各校每學期學年，算學不及格的人，往往超過四分之一，這巳成爲計算成績的一種常態。但是學生對於算學，爲什麼沒有興趣呢？關於它的原因，有三種說法：</p>
<p>說學生大都無學算學的需要。因爲不感覺需要，所以不發生興趣。我以爲敎育須適應需要，誠然不錯，但這個問題，究竟是根本沒有需要呢？還是不會引起需耍呢？諸位聽到下面，便可明白。</p>
<p>說算學不是每個學生能學的。分析靑年的頭腦，有的偏於文科，有的偏於理科，不當强迫人人學算學。我以爲這個理由，極不充分。我們可以說每個學生未必都能成算學家，但如說某人生來即不能學算學，那是沒有根據的武斷。因爲中學甚至普通大學裹（算學系當然除外）所敎的算學，祇限於初等的範圍，祇要握着程序，一步一步前進，一些也不困難。若說這一點也不能學會，未免過於自暴自棄了。</p>
<p>說學生對於算學即感覺需要，即不自以爲非共性之所近，但無論如何，總覺算學是麻煩的，是單調的。我以爲麻煩和單調，是人生不可避免的現象。我們知道宇宙間形形色色，固覺很繁，從另一方面看來，亦很單調。如地球繞着太陽，一步一步的移動，一秒一秒的經過，這是多麼單調啊！如果他忽覺厭煩，略停一停，或略快一快，則世界將如何？</p>
<p>依這三種說明，皆以爲學生學習的興趣不濃厚，這固是成績不良的　　原因，然而學習的興趣，是可以設法培　　　　。怎樣引起需惡？怎樣轉移個　？和怎樣養成習慣？這不是沒法解决的問題，今在提出學習的方法以前，先說明舉算　的目的。</p>
<p>第一，學算學可以獲得研究科學的工具，我們要在今後世界上求生存，非研究科學不可；而一切科學的基礎，無不建築在算學上。小學的自然科初中的理化科，僅僅說明自然現象的皮毛，尙可不需要算學的助力，一到高中，便常要應用算術·代數·幾何，和三角來計算物理化學的問題。如運動的距離和時間；力的分合和功能；水與氣的壓力和比重；熱量的收放和物體的漲縮；光錢的行進和波動的傳播；電流的强弱和抵抗的大小；以及原子量，分子量，週期律，化學當量，化學方程式等等的計算；何處不需要算學？倘更進一步，任何科學的書籟，若是稍涉專門的，信手翻來，總可見著短的D，長的S，連篇累牘地記載不絕，這是對於科學最有力量最有效用的一種工具——微積分。假使沒有微積分，二十四紀的物質文明，便不會發達到現在的程度。但是我們若不能學會算術代數幾何和三角，便不能學微積分，即不能研究科學。因爲算學是研究科學的敲門磚，算學是研究科學的科學，我們所以感覺科學的深艱，都是算學基礎不好工具不完備的緣故。若於算畢有了相當的修養，就可以逐漸深人，了解科學，做到發明創造爲社會人羣造福的地步。</p>
<p>第二，學算學可以解决日常生活的問題衣食住行，生產消費，凡有數量的關係，總須應用算學的知識，纔可適應我們處世接物的要求。這是最淺顯最親切，人人都可感覺到和實際遭遇到的好處，用不着我多說。</p>
<p>第三，學算學可以指導人生的正當途徑我們可以說不希望做算學家，不預備研究科學，甚至說不需要生活的便利，但是我們總不能說不要做人。算學也就是一種指導我們怎樣做人的哲學，因爲算學的特性，和社會上種種不良的現象，針鋒相對的很多，列舉起來，有下列幾點：</p>
<p>確實　口是心非，言不顧行，社會上愈是號稱文明的人，虛僞的程度愈大，不獨一社會一國家如此，虛僞的空氣，直充滿了全世界，這種病可以用算學來醫，因爲算學是絕對確實從不說謊的。譽如，一，不能小於〇，二加三不能等於四，也不能等於六。</p>
<p>嚴正　馬馬虎虎，隨隨便便，固是到處可以見得着的人們的態度；而「差不多」三字，又成了一般人的口頭禪。這種病也可以用算學來醫，因爲算學是十分嚴正從不苟且的。譬如證明幾何，能有一點馬虎，一語隨便嗎？</p>
<p>有秩序　平時對於時空，任其顚倒錯亂，一遇公衆集會，更是嘈雜紛亂，令人不堪，這樣紛亂的現象，要予以救治，也可以借算學的功能。因爲算學是最有規律的，作一圖，列一式，均須依一定程序，前後左右，排列井然，社會苟能如斯，一切自無衝突。</p>
<p>有普遍性　在他國，惟有代表國家的外賓，可以享受治外法權的便利，而在我國，則對內常有享受法律以外優越待遇的人，這種特殊的情形，最足以妨害社會國家的進步和統一。最近我們的敵人，不就是拿着某省是特殊環境某地方要有特別辦法的口實來壓迫我們嗎？惟算學在一種規定下，沒有例外，所謂普遍性，是算學的特性之一。經此訓練，自無自命例外的弊端。</p>
<p>博大而精微　狹小是人們的個性，因爲他們不會學過立體幾何，或雖學過而巳經淡忘，所以缺乏空間的觀念，專一在牛角尖裹拼命鬥爭。疏忽又是人們的常態，因爲他們不曾學過精密的算法，所以心粗氣浮，管前不照後地輕鬆放棄，遺誤多端。如果用算學來糾正他們，他們的頭就會拾起來，眼光就會放遠，心就會精細，氣就會平和。</p>
<p>上面說過，學生學算學的興趣所以不好，是因爲怕難。算學誠然不是一個怎樣容易的學科，但在初等範圍內，尙談不到這點。有許多問題，通常以爲難的：如算術四則應用，幾何開始的證題，所可引用的方法和定理很少，不易得着恰如題分的說明；又如解聯立二次方程式，證三角及反三角函數恒等式，所需的手續很多不易達到最後要求的一步；其實次類問題，不過有的太覺簡單，有的較爲繁複，並不算難。因爲它們究竟不是不可能，不是無法解，如初等幾何不能作圖的規迹，或五决以上文字方程式，那纔是眞正的難題！又如對從未學過什麼幾何的人，講三角及解析幾何，自然感覺困難，若自初中一年級順着次序，學到高中三年級，一步一趨，有何難處？所以學者於學習的實際，祇要注意决列三點，自無所謂難了。</p>
<p>理論要扼要　一種學科，或該科的一部，總有它所引爲根據的理論，且必各有其淪據的中心。初等算學雖很簡單，也有簡單的理論。但能提網挈領，其餘自迎刃面解，不成問題，如代數方程式解法，所根據的，不過是「逐步求出原方程式的同值方程式來」一個原則；解析幾何中最重要的，也就是，「以適合方程式的根做坐標的點無不在方程式所代表的軌迹上而於軌迹上任取一點其坐標又無不適合方程式」一條定理；此類要點，祇要體認得眞，歸納得當，抓住一二，便可應用無窮。</p>
<p>體系要分明　科學方法，貴能分類，其內容儘管雜，條件儘管多，各有其系統的存在，和類的可能。算學上體系最分明的，菓如幾何，一定理，一定義，逐欵引伸，不許絲毫紊亂：又如代數的數，可以解釋爲廣義的算術的數，所以代數上種種算法，都可看做算術的推廣；而數系統的成立，則由整數分數逐漸擴張至無理數虛數，遂合成了複素數的量大範圍。凡此皆算學上極有秩序極有意義的連繫，學者如能分淸，自不覺其複雜。</p>
<p>基本方法要熟練　學算學不僅耍懂，還要熟練，前巳說明，而且許多理法，旣是由淺入深層累曲折而來的，允須從最初一步起，遂步練習，通體嫻熟。學生的代數三角不及格，不是代數三角的理論不懂，而是數字的計算不熟，所以答案無結果；解析幾何考不出，不是二决曲綫的性質不明，也不是圖解的法子不會，而是代數方程式不能整理，幾何定理不能應用，三角公式不能操縱自如；凡看過試卷的敎師，總可指出學生缺點。所以我們學算學，應該注重練習，更應該注重基本的練習。</p>
<p>至於有的問題雖不難，卻不免於繁，這是無可諱言的。但是如果承認科學的重要，必須培養精於科學的人，才允須訓練適於科學的頭腦，及合於科學的精神。這種不怕煩，有耐心，孜孜矻矻，埋頭苦幹的態度和習慣，正可在學算學的時候，把它深厚的培植起來，積極的鍛鍊起來，以備將來擔當更繁重更艱苦的工作，區區算學式子的繁複，又何足道？</p>
<p>諸君！廣大的自然界，燦爛的學術界，有待於我們發揮光大的尙多，諸君切勿妄自菲薄，趕緊努力潛修，安知將來不可成發明家？不可在算學上有所貢獻爲人類大放光明？祇要不畏難，不苟安，提起無限的興趣，下個甚大的决心，總可有志竟成，福利世界！亞幾默德研究幾何，敵兵巳到窗前，猶在沉思不輟，這是研究算學的眞精神，也就是怎樣達到學習算學最大目的的最好方法。</p>
<p>總之學算學可以矯正社會上種種不良習慣；可以指導我們的人生觀；雖然達到此項目的，並非算學本體的功用，但不能不認爲救濟末俗的一個良方。</p>
<p>目的旣明，便可討論方法。我們怎樣學算學，進一步說：怎樣使算學的成績好？敎師固然有很大的責任；但是敎師祇能就學生學算學的目的，設法引起學生對算學的興趣，設法指導他們向前去努力。譬如小孩不會走，大人衹能領導着他們走，不能代他們走。算學的成績好不好，還在學生自己努力不努力，所能我今天的論點，側重在學生的一邊。</p>
<p>現在的學生可分五等，而不肯用功毫無覺悟的，尙不在內。此五等的最後一等，就是在考試失敗後方纔警醒，但不知亡羊補牢，不趕快想補救方法，祇知和敎師爭論分數的學生；第四等是考試失敗後自知以往的錯誤，而發憤讀書的學生；雖說他的用功未免太晚，但比最後一等巳經好得多了！</p>

<p>新新社云、本市各團體發起組織之國貨運動聯合會、自上月十日成立以來、對於提倡國貨、分國內國外兩部進行、工作極爲緊張、新新社記者、昨特往訪該會常務委員潘仰堯、據談工作情形甚詳、茲分誌如次、</p>
<h3 id="c107">積極進行 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>據潘君謂、提倡國貨、實爲當今要圖、故近年來奔走呼號熱心提倡者、頗不乏人、自婦女學生兩國貨年相繼舉行後、對於國貨確具相當成績、試看在舉世不景氣的籠罩中、本市各大工廠、均得安渡兩重年關、並且據海關公布、去年十二月分、竟有五百萬元之出超、足徵人民對於國貨之服用、已有相當愛好、廠商於出品、苟能不斷改進、社會上更爲竭力提倡、則國貨前途之光明、正未可限量、本會爲求成效起見、刻已擬具工作計劃大綱積極進行、</p>
<h3 id="c108">國內工作 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>國內部各部　聯席會决定、以長江一帶爲主要區域後、卽由該部主任王性堯、擬具工作大綱、决先從宣傳入手、積極籌組宣傳團、分三組出發、每組三四人、分頭前往南京·蕪湖·蚌埠·安慶·九江·長沙·漢口·宜昌·萬縣·重慶·等處宣傳、接洽服用提倡等工作、刻卞總務部主任王任之等一行、已於前晚首途矣、</p>

<p>國外部、自經决定從南洋入手後、自該部主任張惠康、擬定工作計劃、决定先行從考察需要進行、組織南洋考察團、前往南洋羣島及馬來一帶、從事考察、並物請各駐在地傾事協助進行、以收事半功倍之效、司時創辦刋物、以利宣傳、以上各項措施、已定下星期內、分別召集各部幹車會議後、卽行分頭出發實行工作云、</p>
<h3 id="c110">王理事談 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>中央社云、年來國貨事業、日魷發達、而對國貨之推銷、尤不遺餘力、本市各大廠商合組之國貨介紹所、創設全國各地國貨公司、在滬首先成立後、漸及邊遠各省、截止去年年底、已設立者、有福州·西京·等八處、重慶一處、雖已營業半載、但因建造房屋、故於今歲、始正式開業、茲據記者探悉、各地營業情形、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c111">各地狀況 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>去年各地　國貨公司全年營業者、計有福州·鎭江·鄭州·溫州·長沙·等五處、濟南成立於四月下旬、據公司辦事處調查、各地營業收入、各公司全年總數達一百九十二萬二千八百餘元、而其中以長沙爲最多、達四十六萬餘元、溫州次之、爲三十八萬餘元、鎭江爲二十三萬餘元、而西京雖僅營業七個月、亦達十四萬餘元、可見各地人民愛護國貨之一斑、</p>
<h3 id="c112">社會需求 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>據辦事處　理事王君語記者、各地國貨推銷之情形、頗可樂觀、惟內地人民、風氣淳厚、服用樸實、故所用衣料、以布疋及紡細羅縐等佔大數、其總額則達全銷數百分之五十以上、他如日用品等、亦以樸質無華者是尙、故要深悉社會需求情形、於選配貨品時、一以當地情形爲準、故頗爲顧客所歡迎、</p>
<h3 id="c113">計劃設立 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>王君又談、計劃設立之公司、計有五十餘處、巳成立者、則僅五分之一、故仍須繼續努力、現昆明·廣州·兩處、正建造房屋、年內當可成立、以前各地公司之創立、係應各地紳商之提議、而協議進行、現經理事會决定、將由辦事處視各地之需要、再與當地人士商洽設立、並擬在已有公司之附近鄰市、建設公司、以期推廣云、</p>

<p>去年洋米進口達一萬萬元</p>
<p>財部設九江大介庫已實行</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨晤本市糧食商領袖顧聲一氏、據談、去年洋米進口、竟達一萬萬元之鉅、我國以農立國、乃至有此現象、不僅漏　堪驚、抑亦可恥、自經財政部設糧食運銷管理局、實行統制糧食運銷以來、大收成效、允其關於洋米進口、已漸减少、觀於今年一月份洋米進口無紀錄、卽可證明、現財部在九江所設大倉庫、亦已實行、且因巾央旣具救濟農村之决心、金融界又多實施農村貸欵、農村之復蘇可期、再糧食運銷、統制得宜、預料我國糧食自給問題、不難解决矣、</p>

<h3 id="c116">外銷旺盛　桐油亟待改良 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>改進產製運銷建立國際信譽</p>
<p>努力直接貿易鞏固國外市場</p>
<p>云歲我國桐油外銷極旺、爲近年以來所罕見、此在我國對外貿易中、固屬差可樂觀之現象、惟考其輸出突興之原因、純爲國外一時需求之激增、而非我國桐油巳具推廣銷塲之能力、如欲維持桐油輸出永久之繁榮、仍非對桐油產銷、予以根本之改良不可、新新社記者、特探誌桐油出口興盛之原因及其亟須改良之處如次、</p>
<h3 id="c117">旺盛原因 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>去年一月至九月、我國桐油出口、大爲激增、計九個月合計出口數量爲五七六·九八七公擔、較之往年同期增加百分之七·四、出口總值爲二九·九三八·零九八元、與往年同期相較、增加百分之四一、平均每公擔價格計五一·八元、較往年同期之三九·三元、增加一二·五元、其出口之盛、實爲近年所罕見、考去年我國桐油出口增加、及價格增漲之原因、的有下列數端、　美國爲我國桐油之最大銷塲、平均每年輸入、的達一萬二千萬鎊、經濟恐慌發生後、减至七八千萬鎊、近年以來、因實行復興經濟計劃、頗具成績、各種工業漸趨復興、桐油需要、乃以漸復常態、故我國桐油美銷亦見增加、　意阿戰事發生後、地中海交通、時有阻隔之虞、歐洲各國、爲未雨綢繆計、莫不積極備備原料、桐油爲重要原料之一、需要自益增加、　我國桐油出產、散在內地、貨物運銷、頗費周折、一旦需要激增、市塲存貨吿罄、卽不能源源供給、價格乃因以增漲、</p>
<h3 id="c118">應加改良 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>綜上所述、可見去歲我國桐油輸出之興旺、其主要原因、實在海外需要激增、而其價格所增漲、則由於我國桐油之供不應求、故去年我國桐油外銷、雖極興旺、但此種現象、僅爲一時供不應求之結果、而非我國桐油已在海外市塲獲有推廣銷路之能力、自難視爲常態之發展、故我人如欲維持桐油外銷永久之繁榮、仍須對桐油產銷、加以根本之改良、最要者、厭有下列五點、　我國桐汕培植方法、極不請求、　戶收買後、復隨意貯藏、不免發生腐爛、榨油方法、亦極陳腐、故品欠佳、色彩深淺不勻、夾雜物未能去凈、汕脚過重、酸性太高、復因榨油爲手工業、難有齊一之品質、　我國榨油、墨守舊法、故榨汕率極低、全國產汕量每年損失、爲數至堪驚人、　運銷手續極繁、間有商人混摻雜汕、以關厚利、品質因以變劣、影響對外信用、近雖經各埠商品檢騐局、釐定合格標準、但以所定標準、較美國爲低、此處應逐漸提高、　裝運方法不佳、運費高昂、且時生阻隔、往往不能按時交貨、故市塲有供不應求之虞、　桐油外銷、純操洋行之手、國內旣無直接經營桐油出口之機關、油商復不能聯絡、致市塲市價、純爲外人所操縱、</p>
<h3 id="c119">鞏固市塲 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>有桐油爲我國特產之一、在國際市塲中帶有獨佔性質、美國雖亦從事植桐、但目前尙遠不能自給、若能利用時機、念起從事改良、建立國際信譽、則前途實至爲光明、改良途徑、最主要者、厥在於產製運銷、在生產方面、首應集中我國植桐、由政府匡助、以從事於大規模之種植、如此科學的方法、可以引用、品種可以齊一、生產量可以計算、生產自能增加、在製造方面、榨油應積極採用新法、俾榨油率可以增高、同時復須注意於精煉與分別油之等級、確定各等級之標準、在運輸方面、應研求經濟裝運方法、運輸機關、亦應設法减低運費、及實行負責運輸、以達經濟便捷之目的、至於貿易方面、根本耍圖、在於集中出口、苟國內桐油商人、能團結一致、以共同力量爲大規模之出口組織、則我國國外桐油市塲、自可日臻鞏固、</p>

<p>（南京通訊）全國兒童年正在開始、義務教育正在實施、兒童教育，也漸為人們所注意、教育部全國兒童年實施委員會主辦的全國兒童讀物展覽會、便在昨天（三十日）假大行宮小學的會場閉幕了、記者特驅車前往參觀、茲拉雜記述如次、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>會場大門、設有「全國兒童年木牌」一座、為一倒L形、係紅色之美術字、頗能引起路人之注意、入場後、即依指定之路線行、在入口處、寫着「厲行兒童本位教育」八個大字、然後到達簽名處簽名、這裏張佈着參觀須知、及陳列圖書種類、隨後走入第一陳列室、為輔助讀物類、計分自然·社會·文藝·叢刊·期刊等組、一部份是各地小學校自行編印的兒童補充讀物、另一部份是商務·中華·世界·大東·及兒童年出版的兒童刊物、關於這一類的書籍、特別豐富、一共陳列三室、依照參觀規則、參觀人得以自由取閱、所以這時正有許多兒童、大都是十一二齡、有的不過八九歲、翻閱不已、一部份却在低聲誦讀、一種自動好學精神、不覺留露、原來此時各學校正放寒假、該會曾規定二月一日及三四兩日為各學校學生參觀之期、而這班小學生、竟利用假期、先來參觀、真是值得贊美呢、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>在第二陳列室中、掛着一幅紅地黑字的大幅綢質標語、原文是「女孩和男孩一樣都得受教育」、四週的牆壁上、還懸着許多的木牌、寫着許多警惕的語句、抄錄於次、（一）兒童讀物是兒童知識的寶庫、（二）做家長的、應該替兒童選購優良的讀物、（三）小學應多備讀物供兒童閱讀、（四）小朋友應該節省糖果費購買讀物、（五）讀書的習慣、要從小養成、（六）選擇讀物、最要的條件、有趣味、有意義、適合程度、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>各陳列室、原係大行宮小學的教室、所以容積並不很大、當記者步入第三陳列室的時候、幾乎已有人滿之患、記者當即加以統計、共有四十二人、內成年人十八人、兒童二十四人、反較成年人為多、這恐怕是任何展覽會中所少有的現象、尤其值得介紹的、成年的參觀人、多數是走馬看花、很少有仔細瀏覽的、而一般兒童、却是手不釋卷、流連忘返似的、記者在這室中、徘徊了十分鐘光景、兒童離去的不過三五人、而成年人却已經另換了一班人了、在這裏、很可以證明兒童對於該會的興趣如何了、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>在各陳列室中、全由兒童担任招待職務、這正是給他們表現工作的機會、這時正有一個成年參觀人、在喫瓜子、給一個約莫十三四歲的女招待員發現了、走到他面前、和顏悅色的說道、「在會場中、請您不要喫東西、」這人固然接受了、但是記者却很替一般成年人抱愧呢、因為這是成年人對於兒童丟臉的一回事呀、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>第四陳列室、係教科書類、計分國語·音樂·衛生·常識·美術·勞作等組、牆上懸着「新兒童創造新中國」的紅綢額、很是鮮豔奪目、這裏陳列着許多已失時效的小學教科圖書、記者隨手檢閱了幾冊、一本是高等小學修身教科書、宣統二年十二月學部編譯局出版、陳旭公等編著、一本是單級用初等小學修身教授本、宣統二年四月中國圖書公司出版、金　·顧倬·顧組璣等編著、這兩本書、記者以年齡關係、均未曾閱讀、所以看到這一類的圖書、特別感覺興趣、估計閱讀這一時期的教科書的、至少應在三十五歲以上呢、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>第五第六兩陳列室中、係參考書類、一部份是世界各國的兒童讀物、係由委員會呈請教育部轉咨外交部、令飭駐外各使館、向駐在國教育機關徵集而來、計有英·美·德·意·法·日·奧·荷蘭·蘇聯·波蘭·丹麥等十一國、約各十種、頗為珍貴、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>第七陳列室、係社會流行兒童讀物、也就是門板書攤上的一般不良的兒童讀物、所謂「連環圖畫」、如「混元鏡」、「紅衣盜」、「鳳娘」、「大鬧龍舟」、「吳大人私訪九人頭」、「秦香蓮帶子覓親夫、陳世美不認前妻」等、一共有二百二十九種之多、像這一類的讀物、給一般未成年的兒童看了、所受的影響，究竟是怎麼樣呢、這實在是注意的一個問題、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>這次陳列的書籍、計分袖助讀物、教科書及參考書等三大類、以下再分十八組、二千四百五十種、一萬二千四八五十八冊、其中有鉛印本、石印本、木刻本、有圖畫、有五彩石印、有教科書、參考用書、課餘袖充讀物、各國的兒童讀物、有單行木人·叢書·期刊·定期刊物等、真是林林總總、蔚為大觀、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>當兒童讀展開幕的前夜、全國兒童年實施委員會、曾將舉行該會的旨趣、公布社會、扼要言之、約有下列數點、（一）供國人概覽、以正國人對於兒童讀物的觀感、（二）供專家研究、以為改進並選擇兒童讀物之一助、（三）供文壇參考、以期新舊文學家多多致力於兒童讀物之編著、此外希望出版界嗣後多多徵求著本、並改善印刷裝訂、俾使兒童讀物、情益求精、以求造福於兒童、</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>該會展覽期間、規定自一月三十日起、至二月五日止、閉幕以後、並擬運往全國各重要都市、巡迴展覽、以喚起全國成年人與兒童之注意、（一·卅一·一凡·）</p>

<h3 id="c191">蘇聯糧食問題解決之經過 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 伍幷廉</p>
<p>——從麵包券制之推行到廢止</p>
<p>十月革命後的俄羅斯，由於頻年戰爭的影響，國內生產機關都陷於停頓的狀態，國民經濟幾爲之全部破產，更加以國際帝國主義之經濟封鎖和武力的圍攻，使蘇聯國內發生了極嚴重的糧食問題；在這時期內，蘇聯各地差不多普遍地鬧着飢荒，直至新經濟政策實行之後，蘇聯的無產階級，才能够從極度的飢渴之中逃了出來，然而糧食問題在蘇聯依舊非常嚴重。</p>
<p>第一决五年計劃的開始，蘇聯政府正式規定了麵包券的制度，以保證工業中心和農業區域的糧食供給。當這制度開始實行的時候，蘇聯國內巳經沒有初期那種混亂，不安和飢荒的狀態，國民經濟也漸漸的穩定，可是國內的集體農塲和蘇維埃農塲，依然爲數很少，土地私有制度雖巳廢除，而富農則猶未完全消滅，農業技術較諸工業技術落後，而且收成低微，使獨立的小農經濟反佔了優勢；所以，在這種情形之下，蘇聯政府不得不採用麵包券制以保證工業化的政策和速度，與改進農業的落後，以及農村經濟利益和它底技術之發展。他們誠恐小規模的倘人農業的落後，致使工業的發展受影響，因此，不得不顧慮到工人，城市，以及輕工業原料生產區的糧食的供給。</p>
<p>一九二八年末與一九二九年初，麵包劵制的實行一開始，蘇聯政府立刻集中了六五〇萬萬普特（一普特的三六·一一磅）的糧食，統治了糧食的市塲，以防止糧食的授機，而用國家組織的糧食供給來統制糧食的分配；由政府規定一定的價格，發給工業原料生產區及工業中心區的工人。</p>
<p>這制度首先實行於列寗格拉和莫斯科，隨後才陸續遍及各地。當時由於這制度的實行，曾使蘇聯共產黨內的右派和「左派」份子發生動搖，他們反對向資本主義的殘餘進攻，反對在農村中實行化，但結果，蘇聯政府戰勝了他們的謬誤，而堅决地執行了這個决定，一直到社會主義的建設得到勝利爲止。</p>
<p>一九二八年，麵包券制實行以後，蘇聯糧食的囤集逐年的增高，至一九三四年，國家所支配的糧食囤集已達十五億普特，比較一九二八年增加二倍半左右。而這幾年間，糧食的囤的來源也有了很大的變化，一九二九年囤集的糧食有百分之八六是獨立農民的，而集體農塲僅佔百分之一四；這就是說，一九二九年間的小農經濟還佔着很大的優勢。而一九三四年呢，情形就大大不同了，或者可以說，與一九二九年正處相反的地位：囤集的糧食在這一年中有百分之九二是集體農塲和國營農塲的，獨立農民只佔了百分之八，這表現着在農村中實行集體化的顯著的勝利。</p>
<p>受集中的糧食供給的人數，換首之，就是可以領取麵包券證的人，也逐年的增加；只就城市的人口而言，在一九三〇年至一九三四年之間，巳經增加了一千四百三十萬；一九三〇年，城市工人享有麵包券證者僅一千六百萬人，而一九三四年則巳達四千〇三十萬人；其中享有特別證者一千〇西十萬人，甲種證者一千一百八十萬人，乙種證者九百六十萬人，丙種證者八百六十萬人。在這四種證中，特別證和甲種證在供給上都享有優先的權利。</p>
<p>凡領有麵包券證的人，在當時可以依照券證上所規定的數額去領取自己的糧食；吾則就只有向國營商店去購買，可是這種自由購買的方式，他的價格是要比之國定的價格高貴好幾倍的。據一九三〇年的統計，在蘇聯全國人口一萬萬五千四百萬人口之中，享有麵包券證的的有六千四百三十萬人，其餘有九千〇七十萬人左右是要向國營商店購買糧食的。在當時，能享有麵包劵證的人，大抵有如下的規定：</p>
<p>參加社會主義建設的工人，不論是工廠和農塲的勞動者。</p>
<p>政府機關及商店的職員，和學校的學生。</p>
<p>勞動者的家屬，和一般因國家的公務而損害自己的健康的人—殘廢者。</p>
<p>換言之，不參加社會主義建設的人，在蘇聯是沒有享受糧食供給的權利的，反之，愈是努力於從事社會主義建設的工人，在常時愈得到優待；政府規定了一定的價格給最努力的工人，使他們享有最擾越的權利，因爲，在當時私人糧食的價格是很高的，有時甚至超出國定價格之四十倍以上。</p>
<p>在一般沒有享受麵包劵證的人，這制度之於他們自然是十分不便的。然而蘇聯政府爲了要執行他們的計劃，也就不得不如此。要補救這種不方便的缺憾，在常時唯一的方法只有擴大國營商店和合作社的發展，消滅私人的商業。同時，設法使糧食的來源（生產）逐年增加，使糧食的供給有了保證，然後好恢復常態的進行。關於這一點蘇聯中央執行委員會和人民委員會曾一再加以討論，所以結果才有一九三四年十一月决定廢除麵包券制之認。這决定是並非偶然的，正如一九二八年之規定實行麵包券制一樣，有着它底必然的因素。</p>
<p>首先，是國營商店和合作社在這幾年間的大量的增加，和私人商業之急速的消滅。這表現於數字上是：——</p>
<p>（國營商店和合作社總數）</p>
<p>一九二八年　一二三、〇〇〇所</p>
<p>一九三四年二八三、〇〇〇所</p>
<p>在一九二八年的私人商店還有二十一萬五千所，佔全部商業之六三％，然而到一九三四年則巳全部消滅。所以，國家商業的發展就代替了私人的商業，因之，也决定了麵包劵制的廢除的趨勢。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫在廢除麵包券制的報告中說：「商業的發展對於廢止麵包券制有重大的意義，因此，我們會特別予以注意，……近四年來，零售商業大大的增加了。茲將逐年增加的比率列表於下二</p>
<p>一九三一　三％　一九三三　一五％</p>
<p>一九三二　一一％　一九三四　二四％</p>
<p>如果在商業流通中，商業交易現佔四分之一，那末，工業品耍佔商業交易中的三分之一，商業交易現在對於常態的供給，具有極大的意義。」</p>
<p>其决，是由於糧食來源（生產）的增加，使這幾年來的糧食價格也减低了，這於廢除麵包券制也有極大的意義。在莫斯科，以一九三四年九月和一九三三年九月比較，糧食價格的低落比率有如下表：</p>
<p>裸麥麵包　三七％　小麥粉　四七％</p>
<p>裸麥粉　三三％　稷麥　四四％</p>
<p>小麥麵包　二五％</p>
<p>集體農場的生產品的增加，據一九三西年統計，其對於二十八個大城市的輸入，已增至百分之七五左右，由此可知糧食的增加，對於廢除麵包券制有很大的影響。而且，由於集體農場的貿易之加强國家商業的發展，使黨和政府顧慮到對於商米的調劑，應該提高商業，而不應該减削它的作用。所以，蘇聯政府於一九三四年夏季依照了斯達林的意見，組織了對內貿易委員會來加强這方面的發展。這和麵包券制之廢除也有很大的關係的。</p>
<p>麵包券制之實行是爲了保證蘇聯工業發展和農村經濟之改造，而其廢止，則是由於糧食出產之大量增加而過渡到糧食貿易的發展。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫在報告中，最後會淸楚地伸述到廢止麵包券制的意義，他說：「廢止麵包券制的意義在繼續改良對城市與鄉村的供給，以及進一步滿足人民的需要；以糧食交易代替麵包券，正是表示蘇聯的發展，農村經濟的改變，社食主義的勝利，因爲我們比以前更强盛，故有廢止麵包券制之舉。此次的决定，對於全國國民經濟有全大的意義，不僅足以改良對人民的供給，且足以加緊政治上的鞏固；此外，更能發展蘇聯的商業，鞏固盧布的價格。廢除麵包券制是表示第二屆五年計劃的主要任務已執行；以後，便是如何發展貿易，廢除麵包券制」。</p>
<p>十一月間，蘇聯政府决定廢止麵包券制之後，即着手於一九三五年一月一日開始執行。</p>
<p>據蘇聯當局的估計，一九三五年至少可以囤集一億二千萬普特的麥子，來維持糧食的供給到新麥上市的時候；而且，以前囤集下來的糧食還剩下來許多，可以够市場上的糧食供給。並據國家收穫委員會統計，一九三四年的收穫量，的與前一年相等，而且因爲收成技術的改良，還可以多二憶五千萬到三億普特。所以，廢止麵包券制度的實行，可以得到有力的保證。</p>
<p>實行廢止麵包券制以後，國家首先要規定麵包的價格，和提高工人的工資。同時增加合作社麵包的產額，允其是使麵包生產落後的地方的麵包生產，大量增加發展。因爲麵包和麵粉的價格之變動，會影饗到一般食物的價格，特別是麥子的價格太過低廉，容易助長一般人的投機，和把麥子來浪費，糟蹋。所以，政府必須制止和顧慮到這一層危險的傾向。</p>
<p>同時，爲了麵包券的廢除，麵包價格稍爲增高，所以工人的工資也要隨之而增加，方能適應這種新的生活條件。並且以現金支付給工人，使便於市面的應用，和穩定蘇聯的幣值——盧布的價格。</p>
<p>由於盧布價格的穩定，物價也隨之低落，就生活上言，這於蘇聯的人民是大大的改善。一九三五十一月十五日，蘇聯政府更進一步統一了物價的標準，取銷國營商店制和改革幣制，使國內貿易與國外貿易互相適應。這於一般人民的購買更增加不少的便利。而且因爲减低物價，無形中即增高了工人的工資。據一九三五年九月問蘇聯政府的命令，麵包劵制在這年內的十月更作進一步的廢除，並於一九三六年一月一日實行全部廢止。</p>
<p>九月二十六日，莫斯科塔斯社的電訊云：</p>
<p>「……聯共中委會與人民委員會决議，自十月一日起，舉凡麵包，麵，粗細麵紛，穀物，通心麵，米及糖果等之價格，概行降低，並廢止肉類製品，脂肪，食糖，馬鈴薯等之計口授物券制，而由國立合作社按照各該區國定統一價格，出售於人民。莫期科各項物價降低如下：</p>
<p>麵包　减一五％</p>
<p>裸麥粉　减的二四％</p>
<p>小麥粉　减一四％</p>
<p>粗麵粉　减四％至一三％</p>
<p>米　减一九％</p>
<p>魚　肉　减三六％强</p>
<p>粒糖　减三〇％</p>
<p>塊　　减三五％</p>
<p>牛油　减三一％</p>
<p>人造乳酪　減三〇％</p>
<p>馬鈴薯　減一四％</p>
<p>其他各區物價按此比例降低」。</p>
<p>另外，據十月二十二日塔斯社的草斯科通訊，也有關於麵包券制廢除後，蘇聯國爲商業發展的記載。原文云：「第一第二决五年計劃期間，蘇聯零售商業增加至六倍以上。今年（一九三五年）國內零售商業巳增百分之三五；同時，各種重要食物價格，亦見迅速而有系統之降落；過去三月，减價貨物計有三十餘種，今年十月一日，較去年十二月之物價，麵包减至二分之一，糖减至三分之一，米及肉减至三分之二，牛油，菜油及臘暘减至二分之一；今年上半年中，城市消費者因减價節省六萬萬盧布。商業之活躍，結果使各種食物券於今年十月一日全部廢除。目下各城市，各鄉村俱巳增設肉，魚，牛乳，麵包，等新食物鋪數十百家，貨物充足，蘇聯食物工業，今年產量超過預定計劃數萬萬　布。牛油，乳酷，腦腸，俱已完成一年計劃。蘇聯减低物價，不僅未使商業衰落，且使其迅速繁榮，十月最初二旬之中，莫斯科貿易額達四二五，〇〇五，〇〇〇盧布，牛油及菜油出售凡增一倍，肉，魚，糖亦大見增加，國營及合作商店，因貨物豐富，不僅食物减價，即織物，肥皂，烟草等類價格，亦見降落。十月中，蘇聯各城市之肉價，較九月平均减百之三十，牛油平均减百分之二十；因此，共產黨第十七决大會在第二决五年計劃期間，减低零售價格百分之三五之决議，業屍實現。</p>
<p>從上面的電訊看來，蘇聯之廢除麵包券制的進行，大體上已經獲得很大的成效；如果拿來與初期那種混亂狀態中的飢荒情形和正發生嚴重的糧食問題來比較，眞是不可以度數計。雖然蘇聯今日之廢除麵包券制，並未算得是完全解決了糧食問題，但就它至少已做到了進一步的表現，那恐怕是無欵的吧。反之，我們反觀目前這個經濟恐慌正　　　　　　　　本主義的世界里（連　民地，半殖民地也在內），到處都鬧著嚴重的失業，饑饉。災禍。戰爭。……把大衆　　死亡的　　里去。眞就不可同日而語的</p>
<p>我們且舉出最近丹麥「政治日報，」捷克「普拉加日報，」和蘇聯的眞理報」底柏林通訊里所戴，關於希特拉治下的「第三帝國」德意忘底糧食恐慌的眞實情形，來和蘇聯目前的糧食問題之改進來作一個明顯的對照吧。</p>
<p>十一月三日捷克「普拉加日報」說：「這幾天來，德國牛油和其他油類的缺乏，極其尖銳。食物商店門前的排隊，一天天加長。人們爲了買得四分之一磅的牛油，要費三個鐘頭，有時還買不到。一般家庭主婦，都弄得麻煩，失望，她們雖然時時立在商店門前，但就依然弄不到家中所必要的油品。不但沒有牛油，而且人造乳酪和豬油都將沒有的。其他各種食物也都感到十二分的缺乏。」</p>
<p>十一月四日，蘇聯的「眞理報」說：「最近柏林食物的困難，日益加劇；由此可窺見德國全國經濟狀况的惡化來。食物商店門前的尾巴，業已成了日常的現象。此種尾巴，一天天加長。消費者所能買得的食品數量，很迅速地减少了。……現在牛油。猪油。猪肉。及其它油類，都已按照規定的標準出賣；牛油，人造乳酪，以及牛油等，食物雖尙未規定出賣的標準，但此等食物的價格，業已暴漲，非一般民衆所能及的了。在德國，最便宜最愛吃的，首推豬肉。新近官方將肉價雖然提高，並嚴禁以後漲價，但猪肉還是異常缺乏，在最近數天之內，肉價已暴漲了百分之二十。</p>
<p>十一月二日的丹麥「政治日報」也說：「官方所規定的物價，一般並不遵守。城市一切食物，暗中把價格抬高出賓。至貧民所消費的肉屑，其價格官方未加管理，在數日之內，業己騰漲了百分之六十。商店門前的隊伍，雖有警察的干涉，但反對之聲，不絕於耳。柏林市北部各企業中的建築工人，會宣布罷工，說他們的肚子很餓，不得不分開去尋求食物。」</p>
<p>要是把道個對照淸楚地分析起來，我們可以找出在資本主義沒落期中那種必然地反映出來的現實的因素，然而，這是不止在單獨及表現糧食問題上面的。所以，關於蘇聯的糧食問題之探討，我們自然也不該只把它當作一個單純的問題看，因爲它就和蘇聯國內的經濟發展有着很緊密關聯的；有時從糧食問題之進展上，甚至於還可以看得出國內政治的變動或穩定來目前「第三帝國」的糧食恐慌，正是一個很好的例子。　一九三五年十二月二十八日</p>
<h3 id="c192">中國糧食統制之先决條件 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>目前民食問題的重耍性，就在米穀不足，而要保留相當的民食，用以調節，加以統制，必先做到以下的條件。　須建造新式倉庫，現在所堆儲米穀的倉庫，多是舊式的糧食堆棧或租賃的民房改造。保管的米穀類多商貨，並爲有金融條件的關係，不到數月，均須出庫翻　：所以在保管設備上，不必有怎樣的特殊設備，但如日本有許多米穀，可以保留到十餘年之久，那末它的倉庫設備，斷非營利性質者可比，故我國至低限度，務使一部分的糧食，保留到若干年度不致變化。　須節制全國米穀囤積的數量，因爲現在各地糧食堆棧，與含有商業行爲的米穀倉庫，是民食中間人用以囤積居奇的工具，每當新穀登塲之際，他們利用低廉的價格，向農民大量購進米積，堆儲入庫，留待善價出售。此種行爲，若不加以節制，亦足影響於民食前途，故當將每地現有倉庫的容積，先行辦理登記，然後核定某地需要，分配商營容積數量，如有餘剩的倉庫，則歸公家租賃或收買之。　須登記全國糧食的加工事業，米的儲藏性短，穀的儲藏性長，所以穀經過磨　成米之後，即不能作長期的儲藏。因此，保留民食第三種條件，須注意於穀子的磨　問題。目前民間對於穀子的　米，大多漫無限制；祇求磨盤不息，不問穀子消耗，爲要保留民食起見，對於全國糧食盤坊業，宜先登記，俾有時可作限制。</p>

<p>所以『日曆』，雖掛在壁間，或擺在檯上，他像天天吿訴吾們，自朝至晚，不可以輕易錯過，而且一月一月的，從來沒有不規定，到了星期，他又很顯然的，呈到你眼簾裹，敎你這一天可以休息哩！不過他很忠實的表示，原是一天有一天的光陰，有人偏不是一天一天的和」『日曆』親近，譬如二十號撕去一頁，後一來每隔過了五六天，甚而至於十餘天，一方才拿了一疊撕下來，這種糊裹糊塗過一日子，你去想！『日曆』未嘗孤負你，你畢竟是得罪了『日曆』，不可以不承一認吧！</p>
<p>故『日曆』是不會開口說話的，可是到一了一年的末一天，他實在是不能不大呌一聲，這年頭兒，你們做了些什麼大的事業，末了，只落得背叛國家，稱上他一個『逆』字，號呼奔走，勝了幾千個小學生，唉！『日曆』，眞像氣憤得了不得，隱隱然向全中國的人們喊着。</p>

<p>王實誠道：一萬塊錢是不少，可是我們那塊地，可也不小。說着，就在身上一摸，摸出一張棉料紙畫的圖樣，雙手送給賈多才來看。那圖上地多大，四界如何，全寫得淸楚。而東界一塊地，寫着是唐姓地，計兩畝七分，那正是銀行所委託要買的一塊地皮。照着現在的地價說，至少可值一萬七八千。而金子强是連咸陽那一段在內，只給人家一萬塊錢，這便宜就大了。於是點了兩點頭道：貨賣識主。照着你閣下的意思，要多少錢呢？王實誠道：不能算是我的意思，只可以說是我一族人的意思。他們共要一萬五六千呢。賈多才微笑了一笑道：若論討價的話，可也算不多，不過貨賣，愛主，若買主要也可，不要也可，對於這塊地並不怎樣看重的主兒，你還要想賣大價錢，那常然是不可以的。金子强聽到賈多才說這些話，那簡直是打破他的買賣，心裹自是十二分不高興。可是自己很歡迎的把他請了進來的，到了現在，又轟人家出去不成，便把嘴裹啣的雪茄取出，漫漫在桌沿上敲着，向賈多才望了道：我兄此言一出，這位王兄，就更不要賣了。並不是我一定要貪圖王先生家裹的產業，不過我想着王先生這地面太大了，又是要連着咸陽那一塊地皮，才肯賣的，請問在現時火車還是相隔得這麼樣子遠的時候，無論作什麼生意，大家全沒有把握，誰肯丟下大把的洋錢，買一塊空地在這裏閑着。那王實誠喝完了那杯茶，緩緩的把茶杯子放下，臉上呆呆的，似乎在想着什麼事隨後他就慢慢的站起來，淡笑若道：我先吿辭罷，有話改天說。他說完了這話，隨着又站起來，就有個要走的樣子。買多才把手一伸，將他攔住，因笑道：山不轉路轉，做這樣大的買賣，不是火門口買小菜，隨便三言兩語就把交易定妥了，你不賣給金先生，難道還沒有別人要嗎？（三九七）</p>

<p>— 林深</p>
<p>在去年秋天，杭州作者協社，國立藝專，東南日報社，中國文化建設協會等四大集團公餞上海劇院師生於西湖北岸之鏡湖廳。當時最引杭州人注意的一件事就是上海西施與杭州西施的握手合影。</p>
<p>巧不過的就是兩位西施同姓程，而且同是一樣的高鼻樑。經一個集團公認爲能移勝任西施的少女當然有她相當的美，用不着甚麼「閉月羞花」等等過火的形容詞了。</p>
<p>所謂一上海西施」的程靜子，其面部輪廓富有東方色彩。所以據上海劇院中一部分演員說，陳大悲借職業敎育社考騐新生的時候，一眼就發現這位西施模樣的小姑娘躱在這偭角落裹。後來經過三個月訓練之後，這位程女士果然在聲樂，舞技，表演，種種術課上，顯出她確有超越的天賦。但是，因爲她年齡小，膽量小，社會經騐過於缺乏；在排練「西施」樂劇的時候，這位程女士尙是惴惴然惟自己不孚衆望，幾次三番向擔任編導的陳大悲婉言辭謝。大悲只一笑置之。「西施」由京杭蘇錫四處載譽歸來後，程女士巳爲電影與戲劇兩界中人所注意。如果上海劇院的主辦者換了別人，這位「上海西施」早巳轉到漩渦中去，說不定要鬧出甚麼笑話來哩。</p>
<p>昨天我在卡爾登參觀「花燭之夜」，見穿堂壁上掛着「上海劇院於本星期日公演巧克力姑娘」的預告，中間貼着「巧克力姑娘的程靜子女士」的化裝小影。阿呀！這儼然是一位西洋少女！那裹還有絲毫的東方色彩？沼吳興越的美人西施一變而爲顚倒巴黎人士的巧克力姑娘，竟能這樣的不露絲毫痕跡，化裝的技巧神妙至於此極，我不能不佩服程女士的天才和上海劇院半年訓練的成績了。</p>
<p>據卡爾登賣票人說，該劇導演陳大悲在劇中兼飾要角巧克力大王，即（巧克力姑娘之父，）並非在廣吿上一種空幌子而已。表演的成績雖難逆料，但從卡爾登陳列的「呆片」上看來，這一决的公演在舞臺技巧一方面一定有相當貢獻的。</p>

<h3 id="c215">「以夷制夷」與「以華滅華」 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>近來我們的「友邦」，常在不滿我國採取「以夷制夷」政策，和他們對立，說這是中國的錯誤，是造成中X仇恨的原因，中國應該從速改變態度，棄絕別國，和他們實行「親善提携」，共進束亞於繁榮。當局者的不滿是不消說的，他們每動議要和我們淸算這件事，至若人民方面，不滿的也很多。前些時有一位「友邦」的思想家，曾作過這樣的表示。他在答我國某學者的一封信裹，就明白的說：「貴國用以夷制夷政策，和XX對立，這是世界周知的事實。美國是這樣的帮助過貴國，英國也很狡猾的和XX周旋過。還有蘇俄，對於貴國作過什麼。貴國的代表者，曾怎樣倡導過聯俄容共。這些事，都還顯明的殘留在我們的記憶之中。其結果怎樣，也是我們所記憶的」。</p>
<p>「以夷制夷」，是國際間慣用的一種政策。甲乙兩國對立，每各聯絡一二第三者，以抵禦對方。別國的情形不須說，便拿我們的「友邦」作例子。往時的「英X同盟」，和最近盛傳中的「X德同盟」，卽是這種政策運用。至若中國，「以夷制夷」政策，採用也許採用過，但於我國並無什麼益處。我們從來就只聽有人要陰謀瓜分，却未見有人願意援助我國去制別國。我國某學者說的好：「我們這個國家，還不配和誰爲友，更不配和誰爲敵。因爲友是平等的，敵也是平等的」。</p>
<p>其實「以夷制夷」政策，還是公道的。「以華滅華」手段，才算陰險可畏。近來我們的「友邦」，一方在不滿我國採取「以夷制夷」政策，一方却在運用「以華滅華」手段，東北四省土地，是他們親自伸手出來掠奪的。但他們爲掩世人的耳目計，便把它造成一「傀儡國」，驅使幾個漢奸，作他們的「走狗」。這是「以華滅華」手段。冀東的叛變，成立第二「傀儡組織」，也是「友邦」運用「以華滅蕪」手段的結果。還有量近活躍一時的華北自治運動，也無非這同一手段的表現、總之，我們的「友邦」，現下所採取的對華政策，不是「直接的侵略」，而是「間接侵略」。他們用盡「利誘」和「威迫」的方法，使我國漢奸就範，出賣祖國。這種手段，是極巧妙的，是殺人不見血的毒計。可惜我國一斑喪心病狂之徒，竟甘心「爲虎作倀」，眞是民族的大罪人。故我們覺得，我國今日外侮固然要禦，漢奸也不可不鏟。因爲亡中國者，「外敵」而外，還有「內奸」。</p>
<h3 id="c216">老船夫 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>大地喘息着，像是受不住那零度的氣侯壓迫似的。</p>
<p>天空凍凝着一片灰黯，西北風從大龍頭山峯上捲下來；整個的宇宙像浸在泳窰里，老船夫阿根迎着冷風，踏着凍雪，把縴繩緊緊地扣在肩上，沿着那條漫長的五九塘的提岸走去。</p>
<p>他傴僂着腰，將一項破毡帽的耳朶拉了下來，兩隻手却攏在袖筒里；一步一步的側着身子走着。沒有聲息，也沒有影子，只是用力拉着縴繩向前趕路，凜冽的朔風在面前擋着他，使他走幾步直一直身子透一口氣。</p>
<p>港水是逆流，風也是逆吹，那條破小船兒在離岸三四尺的水面上慢慢地淌，那根縴繩已把矮桅桿子彎成了一倜弓形。他的老婆却坐在艄上小心地把着舵。</p>
<p>時候是已經傍晚了，那禿枝的疎林却有幾隻歸巢的寒鴉在噪呌着：「呀！呀！呀！」的儘將這凄絕而又憂鬱的聲調播送這泳凍的空氣里面。</p>
<p>大地是灰色的，天空是灰色的，老船夫阿根的心境也是灰色的。</p>
<p>小破船兒里是裝着一船松柴，他要把這松柴裝到石湖頭鎭去的。那條小船兒本來已經十分破舊，現在裝了幾十担松柴，把踏舷也差不多浸在水里了。於是有幾處隙縫里已滲進水來。船是航行得分外遲緩了，牛步似的。老船夫阿根要是停一下，它就會倒退下去的。</p>
<p>水花的聲音在船底下發着輕微的嘆息，風吹着光檣子上的篷脚索；拍拍拍地發出了單調的聲音，週遭的空氣是凝固着，河面上是靜俏悄地，遇不到幾條往來的船隻，只不時有一艘內河快班的小火輪，霄破了水面對這里駛過，激得一些波浪撞着塘岸，嗚！鳴！嗚！地將這長嘯的怪聲放在那凝固的空氣里蕩漾。同時那隻小破船也給震得不住發抖，使老船夫阿根是幾乎從塘岸上拉了下來</p>
<p>老船夫阿根最憎恨的是那艘小火輪，因爲它才是他生活的敵人，從前這條港里還沒有行起快班的時候，他這條小破船就是這條港里唯一搭客載貨的小航船。他每天開行一决，今天上明天下，從水涇到石湖鎭，一天至少也有四五千錢可以收入。那時候，他船上也曾用過三個夥計，就是這條小船也每年到六七月里總要上一决岸修理或堦油的，自己半生以來，靠了這條小船雖沒多餘點什麼，可是父母死時欠空的債，和自家娶親等却已弄得淸淸楚楚。那時老婆在家里看孩子，自巳却每天除了揹着搭搭向店家去收店貨外，一切船上事情全交託</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>了船老大麻子阿二，只要等船一開行，他就獨自個兒坐在火艙面上平基上拍烟或喝燒酒了。可是自從那內河快班一開起之後，他的生活就突然給它絕斷，况且近來河里强盜又多，所以店家也不敢寄貨給他，客人也情願去乘輪船；－現在他祇得替人家裝裝松柴或靑菜蘿葡等勉强的把生活挨了過去。</p>
<p>他一路想着一路走，脚下踏着的泥地也凍得彷彿像是石板。風是儘猖獗地在吼呌，大地像快要斷氣了一般，悲慘的顏色，憂愁的空氣，織成了一張簾子在他面前糊着。</p>
<p>天漸漸地暗下去了，一些樹林路徑全成了個模糊的輪廓；只有那無情的西北風的聲音大得幾乎要把幾株禿樹都　了起來。老船夫阿根的身體外面是冷得像冰凍，然而心里却焦灼得在要燃燒了起來，他又急又怕，可是脚下却走不快。</p>
<p>這兒離開石湖鎭還有七里路程光景，但天色已黑下來了，他只得抹了一把淸水鼻涕，拉起作裙角揩去了額角上的冷汗，站下來收起縴繩：</p>
<p>「點燈吧，縴是不能拉了，還是搖上去！」他在岸上向他老婆說。</p>
<h3 id="c217">新街塲 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>—南洋印象之一—</p>
<p>南洋羣島中的馬來亞，誰都知道它是一個世界上產錫最豐富的地方。新街塲，允其是稱爲馬來亞產錫的名區，巨擘！</p>
<p>從吉隆坡到新街塲的有九英里的路程，倘使坐火車，角二錢就够往返的費用，假如要愉適和快一點的話，坐公共汽車也不外多八塊錢。</p>
<p>在一個雨後的晴空，我終於抽出半天的空閑，到錫區－新街塲－去作半日遊，當我乘着風馳電掣般的公共汽車，掬面吹拂着陣陣絲絲的凉風，把心里蘊藏着的鬱悶吹散了，於是，我深深的覺得：熱帶的南國，也有這新情凉爽的天氣！</p>
<p>車出了吉隆坡的市區，烟也似的輕快地從田野間滑溜過去了；一路經過的山巴，路旁兀立着的龐大的鐵廠，轟轟地響着，一堆一堆的亞答屋，低矮地蹲伏在四野，野獸似的；好像生怕鐵廠里這轟轟的聲浪而逃避起來。路越走越高低不平，車行的速率於是乎减低下來。</p>
<p>一到新街塲，不論是高山上或是平地上，張目四望，姻囱林立，好像着了火的森林，燒剩下來的枯幹，炭黑的一柱柱地挿在空曠的野坡上，囪口吐出來團團滾滾的黑烟，裊裊地在空中蕩漾着；錫井遍地，彷彿給雨水冲過後而存留着的許多窟窿。起動機此起彼落，前後呼應轟轟地在耳邊不間斷地饗着，除此之外，新街塲可沒有其他的古跋，勝景，和納凉的地方，給人們憑吊，徜徉躑躅了。</p>
<p>可是，住在這里的居民，却幾乎佔百分之九十是我們的僑胞。最大的錫井，也都是屬於我們僑胞所有的。</p>
<p>沿着高斜的泥路迂緩地走過了公蕉園，沙戥，才假道上窟窿去觀光錫礦。</p>
<p>當我走到錫井的時候，太陽已經西斜了；空曠的天空，蕩漾着深灰色的絨雲，一層一層地凝凍着，彷彿欲雨的景象；然而，時不時從雲縫中，却透射出一錢綫的陽光來。我一面喘着氣，一面不住地掏出袋里的手帕揩乾額角上的汗珠，一顚一斜地向錫井上爬，爬到能站得住足的地方，就探着腦袋窺視鍚井里面的偉大的工程；無數灣灣曲曲的鐵軌，和笨重的抽水機，軋軋轟轟地工作着，雜着工人們的「哎呵」聲浪，交激成一曲有韻率的歌調，在工塲中播奏着。</p>
<p>我又繼續地向上爬，蠻辛苦地爬到簸錫床，這兒是錫井中的最高的地方，錫井里的泉水都匯到這里來，水像瀑布似的沙沙地滾流着，那末，錫魷從這一條一條的水溝里給無數簸錫的工人撈起來。</p>
<p>看看太陽已將吻山了，薄暮的雲霞，擁抱着橙黃的落日，四野的景色，也給烟雲籠住，呈出一種陰暗的顏色了。</p>
<p>錫井的工程的偉大和烟雲里的夕陽的奇觀，是我到新街塲作半日遊的深印刻的印象，至今還淸楚楚地刻烙在我的腦海里。</p>

<h3 id="c218">日本千葉醬油事業參觀記（二） <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— （葉西園）</p>
<p>從盛唐一直到現在，中國同日本依若原有的技術製造着醬油。隨着明治的維新，西歐的產業革命也帶到了日本；機械的使用，根本改造了生產的方式。一向是東亞手工業特產的醬油，於是魷有人企　着它的生產機械化。到最近，日本的產業無不突飛猛進，就是一向是手工業的醬油，在日本，也以機械大量生產的姿態出現了；而我們的醬油業還依舊滯留在原始的手工業時代，令人起無窮之威。醬油事業可以說完全　東亞的一種特產，以西洋的技術，應用到東亞的特有的產物使它脫離了原始的手工業的姿態，而成一種大規模的現代企業；在這一點上，　們無論如何不能不佩服日本人卓絕的精神與毅力。這是要明瞭他們的事業，以爲我國醬油業現代化的張本，作者，在一九三一年東渡至日本去參觀他們的成跡。然而自從日本回來之後到如今，時間很快的飛去了三四年，其問中日間的關係却時有不定，而我國經濟生命又日窮，從前的希望，依舊還仍是希望，而沒有一日可以實現，當我回憶着過去出發時的雄心，而握筆寫此文的時候，心中安不有無限神傷。</p>
<p>日本的醬油事業大抵集中在三個地方。　是關東千葉的一帶，　是關西和歌山一帶，　九州福岡一帶。他們有的以製造所謂淡口醬油出名，如關西的「龍野」有的以製造所謂「速釀」法的醬油出名如東京的「日本釀造」。然而規模最大，銷路最廣的幾家公司，差不多都在千葉。千棄在歷史上，也是日本醬油事業最發達的地方。這也許是千葉的氣候，千葉的水特別宜於造醬，也許是它的距離江戶（東京）近，由於達官貴人傳播開去。也許因爲幕府在江戶的緣故千葉的造醬業因而發達。無論如何，就日本整國造醬業的形勢看來，千葉醬油業的發達，當是較遲的；因爲若使日本造醬技藝是中國傳過去的話，自然必首先在九州以及關西一帶發展開來。</p>

<p>臘瓶新透臘梅香。畫意詩情繫我腸。椒酒孤飲憐白髪。宜春逼寫憶紅粧。歲朝團拜催詩急。元夜開筵議畫忙。時世承平黎庶樂。新年嬸歲有餘囊。呼盧采烈裙釵興。喝雉聲高客子狂。曾幾何時風雲變。最惱人處國防傷。凋零商業愁生計。離亂人民鬧恐慌。熱血換來新歲月。寒心不如舊文章。願新年自此新民氣。拚性命各自做一塲。耐辛熬苦事工商。</p>

<p>開篇「梅花」</p>
<p>梅花雖不是花王。品格淸高出衆芳。自古詩人曾品定。花魁名譽世無雙。那菊是花中之隱逸。蓮稱君子亦相當。周子愛蓮陶愛菊。兩人志趣並非常。不知道。梅是隱逸兼君子。性淑品高貌亦莊。人世多稱桃李好。桃花艷冶李花香。那梅花。只安常。不願時髦學新妝。絕世風流無俗氣。羞與桃李鬥芬芬。無良媒。亦何傷。藐姑仙子本無郎。山中好友松與竹。夜半淸風月與霜。那凡卉只宜聽號令。誰能够先與古春光。所以說。新月舒眉衆星耀。老梅開口百花忙。天荒地老誰知巳。只道人間目盡盲。却不料。多情還有林和靖。知音要說孟襄腸。而今國花推定更榮光</p>

<p>開篇「悼亡」</p>
<p>茅舍蕭蕭傍竹籬。西風慘淡雨霏霏。幾枝黃菊花初放。觸景傷心最慘凄。想淸那。去歲殘冬妻病死。今朝輪算有半年餘。他生前最愛籬邊菊。親自栽培手不離。到如今。菊花猶在人何在。見花能不想妓妻。他自到我家循婦道。女工針指不爲低。庭前洒掃時常潔。衆饋烹庖味出奇。客到堂前茶便有。多用茱萸與武彝。描花刺繡番新式。搖下棉紗織布機。綢綾緞縐箱籠有。四季裙衫整備齊。黃昏未敢貪眠睡。燈下常看女訓書。積蓄銀錢資助我。兌金買寶却有餘。堂上翁姑都孝順。靜心撫育子孩提。炎天與我驅蚊帳。秋凉又要備寒衣。夫妻數載相和陸。從無反目有是非。到如今　幃空設留遺像　　魂渺渺　歸西。</p>

<p>雙親　　不盡構思淚。審卑人。兒女哭聲啼。幾張桌椅誰揩抹。滿室灰塵扑面飛。孤裳獨宿職殘漏。冷落粧台影亦稀。欲思續娶賢能女。怎奈。囊中乏鈔少挪移。許多恩愛情難割。路隔陰陽無會期。分明劈破菱花鏡。好鳥同林兩處棲。苦境訴誰喻。</p>

<h3 id="e8">Sun Ke's Opinion on the New Public Bonds: Improve Issuance Methods, Respect Public Bond Law Prices, Limit Public Bond Interest for Construction Projects; Two Public Bond Regulations Drafted <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The method of revitalizing the economy and consolidating credit, while taking both into account, agreed upon by Finance Minister Kong and the financial community in Shanghai, is the second issue that has aroused serious attention after the implementation of the new currency policy. The reporter went to see Sun Ke to inquire about his opinion on this issue. He replied as follows: Mr. Sun first praised the declaration of bondholders to support the government's entire economic revitalization policy, which is indeed a sign of moral progress among the people, and believes that this agreement between the government and the financial community is indeed a crucial plan at present. However, in his personal opinion, the past methods of issuing public bonds should be greatly improved. According to the various public bond regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan, public bonds are issued at 98% of their face value. The 98% price is the legal price of the public bonds. However, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, almost no public bond issued has been sold at the legal price. They have all been discounted at 50% to 70%, resulting in heavy losses for the government each time it issues public bonds, and the purpose of issuing the bonds has been obstructed. In the future, all newly issued public bonds should respect the legal price of public bonds. Although the current nominal interest rate on public bonds is 6%, in fact, because each 100 yuan bond can be purchased for only a few dozen yuan of legal tender, the interest is still calculated based on 100 yuan, so the interest rate has reached more than 10%. Because of the high interest rates on public bonds, people are extremely eager to invest, and they regard other legitimate construction projects as dangerous and shrink back, causing various social panic phenomena. In the future, the restriction on the interest rate of public bonds should be carefully considered to avoid the concentration of capital in public bond investments and hinder the normal prosperity of the national economy. Mr. Sun further stated that the sole standard for issuing public bonds in the future should be their use in construction projects. According to past experience, every public bond issued for construction projects has achieved great results. If public bonds are issued to make up for the budget, not only will the budget not be made up, but it will also greatly affect overall credit. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

According to Dai Qinglian of the Mongolian Committee, after reading the newspaper this morning about Wu's assassination, he immediately went to various relevant parties in the capital to inquire, but no reports had been received. This morning, he sent telegrams to the Mongolian Political Council, De Wang, and the Ping Office to inquire. It is expected that a reply telegram will be sent to the capital on the 3rd. However, according to normal reasoning, there are personnel in the Mongolian Political Council's Ping Office, Zhangjiakou, and Chahar, etc. If there was such a thing, there should be a report. Moreover, since Wu is with De Wang, there is no need to come south recently. If he leaves Mongolia, there must be a telegram. However, since there are no reports from any party, it may be a rumor.

<h3 id="e27">China's Foreign Trade in the Past Year <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>China's foreign trade last year showed a tendency to gradually improve in terms of figures. According to customs statistics, the net value of imported foreign goods for the whole year was 919,211,322 yuan, a decrease of 10.8% compared with the previous year. The net value of exported domestic goods was 575,809,060 yuan, an increase of 7.5% compared with the previous year. The total value of imports and exports was 1,495,020,282 yuan, a decrease of 4.5% compared with the previous year. The trade deficit for imports and exports was 343,402,262 yuan, a decrease of 30% compared with the previous year. The best month for foreign trade throughout the year was December, with an import value of more than 65 million yuan, an export value of more than 70 million yuan, and a trade surplus of more than 5 million yuan, forming a rare phenomenon in China's foreign trade in recent decades.</p>
<p>However, in reality, the above situation seems to be insufficient to make people optimistic. The reason why the trade figures improved last year was not due to the progress of domestic industry or the improvement of trade technology, but due to the decrease in the purchasing power of the general public and the various disputes between China and foreign countries. The new currency policy implemented by the Chinese government in November, which significantly increased foreign exchange rates, facilitated exports and hindered imports, was also a major reason for the trade surplus in December last year. Now, let's look at the situation of major imported and exported goods last year. On the import side, the only items that increased compared with the previous year were food, machinery, hardware, paper, wood, metal products, and miscellaneous goods. Among them, the import figure for food was the largest. Other items such as cotton products, woolen products, vehicles, ships, kerosene, sugar, and tobacco all decreased. On the export side, the largest increases were in seeds, kernels, and vegetable oils, followed by livestock, cotton, peanuts, raw silk, and eggs. Tea, leather, cotton products, and piece goods all decreased significantly. This shows that the purchasing power of the general public has reached its limit, so the imported goods are mostly materials needed by the government to engage in economic construction and the people to maintain their minimum living standards. That is, the exported goods used to exchange for these materials have also shifted their focus away from manufactured goods and primary agricultural products and towards agricultural by-products.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between disputes between China and foreign countries and China's foreign trade, since the Manchurian and North China incidents, China's customs administrative sovereignty has been repeatedly undermined by foreigners. Customs offices in the areas where the incidents occurred have either been forcibly occupied or monitored. Even those outside the incident areas have often been subjected to foreign armed interference. Last year, a certain country protected smugglers operating by mercenaries and soldiers with warships, which has become an open secret. Smuggling disputes in Shantou, Chaozhou, Tianjin, and the Great Wall ports have also been repeatedly reported in newspapers. These secret imports that have not been registered by customs have far exceeded the reduced import figures in the customs trade report.</p>
<p>In short, China's foreign trade is still far from a truly good turn. If we want to improve it in the future, we should make efforts to restore the purchasing power of the people, promote overseas markets, and revitalize domestic industries. And maintaining the integrity of national territory and sovereignty is a necessary prerequisite.</p>

<p>Tianjin: In the past two weeks, there has been a sharp increase in the number of people from North Manchuria, both Chinese and Russian, seeking refuge in Tianjin. They all say that the relationship between Japan and Russia is extremely tense, and that conflicts occur daily at the border areas between the Japanese puppet regime and Russia, including Heihe, Manzhouli, Hailar, Suifenhe, and Sanjiangkou.

<p>Tokyo: The Soviet Union deeply fears the rise of Japan and Germany and has recently sought closer ties with England. However, an Anglo-Soviet rapprochement has significant implications for the political situation in East Asia, so the Japanese Foreign Ministry is paying close attention to this. The Soviet Union's greatest fear in Europe is the National Socialist Germany, which is steadily building up its navy. The Soviet Union had planned a Franco-Soviet alliance to contain it, but since the advent of the Saar Cabinet, this has come to nothing. The Soviet Union has had to change its European foreign policy and seek rapprochement with England. The Soviet Union, which has always refused to send envoys to the enthronement ceremonies of monarchs in other countries based on religious grounds, has now decided to dispatch [Vyacheslav] Molotov and [Ivan] Maisky to attend the coronation of the British Emperor, which is quite telling. If the Anglo-Soviet joint front extends to East Asian issues, it will affect the problems of Inner Mongolia and North China, which deserves serious attention. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Purchases Fine Horse Breeds from England for the Red Army Cavalry</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Russia has now purchased fine horse breeds from England, so the Red Army cavalry will no longer suffer from a lack of quality horses. The recently purchased horse breeds are all strong and fast steeds. The majority will be sent to national ranches to breed superior horses, while the minority will be distributed to various racecourses for use. Before the revolution, Russia selected Russian and Arabian thoroughbreds to crossbreed, producing an excellent horse breed. This contributed greatly to the victory over the White Russians during the revolution. However, many horses were killed in action, and very few remained. Among those that remained, the breed greatly degenerated. General [Semyon] Budyonny, the Commissar of Agriculture's head of horse breeding, recognizing this, personally took charge of the work of breeding fine horses. (1st Dispatch)</p>

The news of his arrest was released on the afternoon of the 1st. Before the Manchurian Incident, Liu managed the Singer Sewing Machine Company and lived a peaceful life. Later, dreaming of becoming a hero, he plotted to seize the city of Jilin, attacking for a day and night before being repelled by Japanese troops.

<p>The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan to Visit Moscow: Strengthening Diplomatic Ties, This Trip is of Great Significance. Afghanistan Prepares to Join the Near East Pact</p>
<p>Moscow: Afghan Foreign Minister Faiz Muhammad, who recently held talks with British Foreign Secretary [Anthony] Eden in London, will visit here in mid-month. Political figures here attach great importance to Faiz's trip, believing that relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan can be strengthened as a result. Although the two countries have business relations, they have not yet concluded any agreements. This may change after Faiz's visit. Furthermore, Iran, Iraq, and Turkey previously initialed a non-aggression pact, in other words, the Asian Locarno Pact. Afghanistan has also recently decided to join. The country borders the Soviet Union, and its borders with Iran and Turkey also border the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is naturally beneficial for both Kabul (the capital of Afghanistan) and Moscow to strengthen good neighborly relations. In this way, Afghanistan can continue its internal organization work, while the Soviet Union can develop its Central Asian republics, which are culturally backward and whose resources have not been fully exploited.

<h3 id="e34">Soviet Russia's Trade Surplus: The Result of Strenuous Production Efforts <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Russia's Minister of Foreign Trade [Arkady] Rosengolts stated today that various international trade organizations outside the Soviet Union may soon be abolished. Rosengolts's remarks suggest that these organizations are no longer needed because Soviet Russia's international trade is now trending towards a surplus. In the first nine months of last year, the surplus amounted to 130,150,000 gold rubles (total imports were 171,000,000 gold rubles, and total exports reached 301,270,000 gold rubles). Therefore, Soviet Russia does not need to beg others for loans, nor does it have to let others depress prices to buy Russian goods. In recent years, Soviet Russia has worked hard to produce and strived to reduce foreign loans, which has caused great sacrifices in the lives of the people. However, it has now built up its strength from difficult circumstances, so foreign trade will no longer need to rely on these institutions. The delivery of goods will also be carried out in Soviet Russian ports. In recent years, due to the scarcity of domestic ships, Soviet Russia has paid extremely high freight rates to foreign ships. In order to implement the new methods in the future, the Soviet Russian government plans to build more warehouses within the country and train people who engage in international trade in foreign languages so that they can communicate with foreign merchants. According to past practices, people in Soviet Russia only knew how to manufacture goods, and all sales matters were entrusted to representatives stationed abroad. This bad habit must be reformed. Furthermore, Soviet Russia should not give up any kind of trade that it should do, so that it can seek national prosperity. (1st Dispatch)</p>

Franco-Russian and Little Entente Discussions Proceed: Promoting Collective Security in Central and Eastern Europe, With Particular Emphasis on Guaranteeing Austria's Independence <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Paris: According to reports in the local newspapers, Le Petit Parisien, Le Matin, L'Ère Nouvelle, and L'Action Française, diplomats from various countries are gathering here to hold talks. The main topic of discussion is the organization of a collective security system in Central and Eastern Europe, with particular emphasis on guaranteeing Austria's independence. L'Ère Nouvelle writes, "Since the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, countries have had no time for other matters, and Germany has taken the opportunity to expand its military without sparing any effort, thus changing the balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe. However, what the politicians of the three Little Entente countries, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, are worried about is the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria, which is even more worrying than the German invasion of Austria, because the German invasion of Austria is not yet imminent. In addition, regarding the independence of Austria, which was previously guaranteed by Italy, the Little Entente countries are now also likely to take its place. As a result of Soviet Foreign Minister [Maxim] Litvinov's recent lobbying in London, King Edward VIII, Foreign Secretary [Anthony] Eden, and the majority of British public opinion have come to believe that Soviet foreign policy is mainly conservative, as can be seen in the Soviet Union's participation in the League of Nations' collective security movement. Regarding this, it is reported that the Soviet government will soon use the strength of the Red Army to promote and support the collective security organization in Central and Eastern Europe."

<p>Paris: Soviet Foreign Minister [Maxim] Litvinov held talks with Foreign Minister [Pierre Étienne] Flandin this morning. It is generally understood that the main topic of discussion was the organization of a collective security system in Europe. What the Soviet Union is most concerned about at present is the establishment of a universal security system within the scope of the League of Nations. Regarding the ratification of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact (the pact was concluded in May of last year, but France has not yet ratified it), the Chamber of Deputies has scheduled it for discussion on the 11th of this month.

<h3 id="e40">German Minister of Economics Does Not Forget European War Losses: Attacks Treaty of Versailles, Remarks Offend Poland and Spark Protest <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: On the 28th of last month, Minister of Economics [Hjalmar] Schacht delivered a speech to 2,000 steelworkers in Breslau, Upper Silesia, stating that Germany's loss of Upper Silesia was due to the Treaty of Versailles. He strongly criticized the treaty, and his remarks offended Poland. Polish Ambassador [Józef] Lipski here has visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest this matter. The following is a record of Schacht's speech: Schacht said that Upper and Lower Silesia were closely related, but since the Treaty of Versailles assigned Upper Silesia to Poland, it was divided into two, and the joint economy fell into a slump. We foolish and clumsy politicians committed this unfair act, and we hope that it will eventually be corrected. (This section of the speech has not been officially released.) Schacht also said that since the treaty has this provision, our working people have not suffered economic damage. The reason why Germany is demanding rectification of this unfair act is neither to seek revenge nor to start a war, but solely for economic reasons. We hope to achieve effective cooperation in a peaceful manner. However, those who observe the facts only based on reason, without other forces as backing, occupy only an ordinary and insignificant part in world history. The reason for the success of German National Socialism is that behind its moral strength, there are still political and military forces sufficient to protect and enhance our moral strength. According to Polish figures here, the issue of German trains passing through the Polish Corridor has already complicated the political relations between Germany and Poland. Now that Schacht has made this speech on the second anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, it will be even more deeply impressed upon others. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to sources at our news agency, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel [Józef] Beck, on his way back to Poland from Geneva, passed through here and met with Foreign Minister [Konstantin von] Neurath, during which he discussed the issue of German trains passing through the Polish Corridor (railway traffic between Germany and East Prussia must pass through Polish territory), saying that the long-standing unresolved issue is enough to have an adverse effect on the future of German-Polish friendship. The amount that German trains should pay for using Polish railways is calculated at 35 million marks. In addition, Poland has other claims against Germany, totaling about 130 million marks, all of which have been stagnant. Poland has repeatedly urged payment, but Germany claims that it is unable to remit the funds. Therefore, Poland threatened that if Germany does not pay attention, it will restrict the country's trains from using Polish railways. Recently, the Polish government also ordered an 80% reduction in imports. All of this has made German business figures extremely unhappy, believing that after the signing of the German-Polish commercial agreement (in November of last year), the economic relations between the two countries had gradually developed and were expected to produce good results. Now this hope has practically vanished. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Geneva: According to the report released by the Expert Committee, the sanctions are proceeding smoothly on the whole. However, in order to achieve full effect, the League of Nations has asked League of Nations member states that have not yet implemented sanctions, such as Austria-Hungary and Albania, to report in detail their trade with Italy. The Expert Committee also stated that Morocco and Tangier have not implemented sanctions, and there is a definite need to enforce sanctions in these two places. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: The Expert Committee on the Implementation of Sanctions, appointed by the Coordination Committee of the League of Nations Assembly, appointed a subcommittee at its meeting on the 29th of last month to review the answers submitted by member states regarding the embargo on arms and raw materials against Italy in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, and to prepare a report for submission to the Expert Committee for discussion. Yesterday, the subcommittee met and completed drafting the report, which was sent to the Expert Committee. The Expert Committee met last night and passed the report, completing its work. At the subcommittee's meeting the other day, it had received 27 answers regarding the recommendations of the Implementation Coordination Committee, which were reviewed and found to have "very few points for criticism." The report made two recommendations to tighten the current sanctions: 1. France and Spain should implement sanctions in their protectorates in Morocco, North Africa, and the governing authorities of the Port of Tangier (an international condominium) should be advised to implement them as well. 2. Statistics and other information should be collected and published on the current state of trade between countries implementing sanctions and other nominal countries and Italy, in order to understand what effect the sanctions presided over by the Coordination Committee are having on the current state of trade with Italy. The Coordination Committee should decide to question each member state. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: There was a rather heated debate at today's meeting of the Expert Committee on Sanctions. The Peruvian representative explained the reasons why Peru had been unable to implement sanctions. He stated that Peru had already declared that it could only implement economic sanctions against Italy after February 20. The biggest reason for this was that most of Peru's industries were owned by Italians, or Italians had provided financial assistance. The Romanian representative retorted that this situation existed in many countries, but Romania implemented economic sanctions against Italy regardless of everything. As a result of the debate, the Peruvian representative promised to convey the committee's views to the government of that country so that it could quickly implement this case. (1st Dispatch)</p>

Its task is to discuss the oil embargo issue technically and submit a report to the 18-nation sub-committee. Political issues are not within the scope of its deliberations. It is expected that the Expert Committee will be based on the new neutrality law passed by the US Congress and will put forward two different recommendations, showing that it is feasible to impose an oil embargo on Italy, depending on the attitude of the United States.

Ambassador to England [Dino] Grandi also rushed from London to attend. Party figures attach great importance to the ambassador's trip, as he has recently met with British Foreign Secretary [Anthony] Eden several times. According to news from London, Britain's attitude towards the solution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute is no longer as stubborn as before, as the attitude of the country's colonial figures is the same. They believe that once Ethiopia wins, the prestige of white people in the colonies will suffer a serious setback. Furthermore, the Italian Council of State revised the organization of the Supreme National Defense Committee on November 30, adding all army, navy, and air force commanders and cabinet ministers who were not previously members of the committee, becoming a national representative body to cope with the war. Since its reorganization, the committee has not met. It is now scheduled to hold its first decision-making meeting on Tuesday (the 4th). Count [Galeazzo] Ciano, Prime Minister of Public Information, who returned from the East African Front in December last year, has now joined the committee according to the new organization law. It is said that he will return to the front line soon. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: Today's communique here stated that as of last week, 3,000 Italian soldiers had been killed in the northern front, the Fascist Blackshirt Division was almost unable to fight, and another 5,000 Italian soldiers were wounded or captured. 18 tanks and armored vehicles, 33 field guns, 175 machine guns, and 2,605 rifles were captured. The battle took place in the Tembien area west of Magal. Italian Commander-in-Chief [Pietro] Badoglio was active in this area for more than a week, trying to drive back the Ethiopian guerrillas who were endangering the Italian army's lines of communication, but without success. The communique also stated that since the general offensive on January 21, the Ethiopian side had suffered a total of 1,200 soldiers killed and wounded. It also said that after the Ethiopian army launched an offensive for several days, the Italian side counterattacked at that time, and the Ethiopian army retreated, and then launched another counterattack on the 28th, when the Blackshirt Division was defeated.

<p>Akyab: After several small battles, the Italian and Abyssinian armies have now begun a decisive battle for control of the 75-mile road from Magdala to Adowa. The main Italian force is concentrated southwest of Haçane. However, the combat strength of the Blackshirts has been greatly weakened in the first fierce battle since the start of the war. The threat to the Adowa road from Abyssinia does not only come from the southwest. The army commanded by the commander-in-chief of the northern front line of the Abyssinian army is currently gathering near Agra and will take this road from the east. At the same time, Abyssinia's Minister of War, General Mekete, although already seventy years old, is also stationed in Sekota with troops as a reserve force, ready to be deployed to the front line when necessary. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Akyab: A military expert here told a Reuters interviewer today that the Abyssinian army can retake Magdala at any time. The Abyssinian side is very confident. However, a frontal attack is unlikely to be launched, as this would mean unnecessary sacrifice of lives. Therefore, the Abyssinian army will concentrate its efforts on the northwest to contain the Italian army. The reason why the Italian army is attacking the mountains is probably because the road from Magdala to Adowa is now very vulnerable to attacks. Now that the Italian army's attack has failed, the Abyssinian army's lines are forcing this road. The Abyssinian side will use guerrillas to frequently harass this road, preventing the Italian army from having a peaceful night. A recent communiqué on the battle situation in the Tembien area stated that more than 3,000 Italian soldiers were killed in January, but the number of deaths and injuries in the Tembien battle was not specified.

<p>Akyab: According to a dispatch from our correspondent, O'Chana, fierce battles have continued on the northern front line in recent days, but there has been no change in the lines of either side. The Abyssinian army won the fierce battle in the Tembien region. Although the positions have not moved and Magdala, Axum, and Adowa are still occupied by the Italian army, the morale of the Abyssinian army has been greatly boosted. They believe that the victory in this battle can be compared to the Battle of Adowa forty years ago. In addition, with the rainy season approaching, the Italian army is not accustomed to this kind of weather, and the war will inevitably be suspended. Therefore, the Abyssinian side is more and more satisfied. As for the southern front line, although it is still quiet on the surface, the government is quite concerned. According to palace sources, the Italian army has crossed 320 kilometers beyond Dolo in three days and has built a strong line of fortifications in the Neghelli area, which is a good base for mechanized units to set out for reconnaissance. At this moment, the Italian army is trying to completely clear the area between Neghelli and British Kenya, and to cut off the roads around Moyale (on the Kenyan border), so that the Abyssinian army will not be able to receive military supplies from that area.

<p>Akyab: After General Dejazmatch Desta Damtew, the commander of the southern front, was defeated by Italian General Graziani, the Emperor has ordered the veteran General Balcha Safo, a member of the Imperial Council, to command the armies on the southern front and recover the lost territories. Balcha is old in age and once commanded artillery under the former Emperor Menelik, with outstanding achievements in the Battle of Adowa in 1896. He is known for his strong will, extraordinary bravery, and is highly revered by his soldiers. In addition, the Minister of Interior, Gebre Mariam, will soon go to Sidamo province on the southern front for inspection, while the Minister of Finance, Fekre Selassie, will go to Bale to take over the command of General Mulugeta's troops, and Mulugeta will replace Desta's troops. Mulugeta once stopped the Italian army from advancing at the Webi Shebelle River and is also one of Abyssinia's famous generals. According to Abyssinian military observers, the patriotic spirit of the Abyssinian army is higher than ever before, and the Italian army's right wing in the south will soon feel threatened. General Nasibu Emmanual, the commander of the Ogaden province in the east, also seems to be preparing to switch to offensive tactics. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Scientific Talks: On Afforestation for Air Defense (Part 2) <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by the Science Society of China, Li Yin-kung</p>
<p>Europeans and Americans are accustomed to respecting international law and the agreements between friendly countries, and they are willing to abide by the so-called diplomatic creeds. When it comes to military aviation equipment, flight takeoffs and landings usually have rules and must not cross the line. This is to avoid misunderstandings and discourtesy. Our country's northern region is often invaded and patrolled by foreign air forces for military exercises. Protests have been heard many times, but those who rely on their strength and act recklessly ignore them. Their ulterior motives can be imagined. Therefore, for those who seek self-defense, for the sake of preparing for a rainy day, they have to urgently plant trees for defense. The author occasionally checked a newspaper on his desk, which contained an aerial photograph of a part of the city of Meudon, France, showing other countries the lush cityscape of trees.</p>
<p>Most of the cities in our country's provinces have few trees, let alone small towns. When I lived in Anqing in the past, I had to rely on written publicity every winter and spring. One title was "Anqing, where birds cannot land." The language was satirical, so as to promote people's awareness. In the past, Kang Youwei traveled to Kaifeng and published his poems on the Iron Pagoda, "Looking into the distance, the high and cold overlooks Bianzhou, the Iron Pagoda of Fantai floats with the clouds. Ten thousand families have no trees and no palaces, but see the Yellow River rolling." His intention to express his feelings can also be seen. Now, at a time when foreign troubles are frequent, afforestation for air defense in areas near cities and towns seems to be something that cannot be ignored. From December to February, it is the best time of year for afforestation. All native tree species (fast-growing ones are excellent) can be used to decorate the scenery.</p>
<p>Now we may as well think of the suburbs. On the country roads in late autumn and frost, woodcutters probably account for more than half of the pedestrians. Carts are pulled and shoulders are burdened, all of which are mountain grass and wild saplings, mixed together and sold in the city as firewood. Among them, there are many miscellaneous trees with a diameter of one inch to two inches. If they are allowed to be preserved for three to five years, it will not be difficult to form a forest. Villagers cut down trees to burn charcoal, and they will not hesitate to cut down trees with a diameter of five to seven inches. Alas. If our country does not have a forestry policy for a day, when will this trend stop? If you talk to the woodcutters about afforestation for air defense, they will definitely think that you are talking to the wrong person. Who knows that all wild trees are the basis of the natural forests of the heavy forest country, which is the easiest way to cultivate them, and there is no need to worry about diseases, pests, and floods. Try taking a survey of the percentage of wild trees protected in the Wulong Mountain area of the capital:</p>
<p>Ratio 92955055555555 out of 100647601000000 hundred and one wild tree name Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata, Betula platyphylla, Lindera obtusiloba, Sophora japonica, Sapium sebiferum, Liquidambar formosana, Ulmus parvifolia, Diospyros kaki, Ailanthus altissima, Celtis sinensis, Acer buergerianum</p>
<p>The above table shows the composition of natural tree species near the capital. If afforestation for air defense is carried out in the capital, it can be used as a basic tree species. Other places may also take it as an example. Here, I would like to solemnly suggest: If you want to engage in air defense, you must plant trees. In urban areas, if each household plants five to ten trees, this goal can be achieved. In my humble opinion, this is the simplest and most economical way to save oneself and the country. A great disaster is inevitable in the future. If this is done to reduce the panic, then this is the author's humble wish.</p>

<p>Saint-Nazaire: A dispute broke out between labor and management at a large shipyard here yesterday. The dockworkers decided to strike, and it is feared that a general strike of French dockworkers will erupt as a result. The workers have been dissatisfied with wages and working conditions for a long time. They were angered by a notice posted by the employer yesterday, believing that this notice was very different from the remarks made by the joint labor-management committee. The workers' leader instructed the workers to stop work, and the crowd followed. Although it is still quiet at the moment, the labor unrest may spread on Sunday, because the strikers are now planning to send pickets to other shipyards to prevent work. It is expected that if a general strike is realized, the launch ceremony of the new French cruiser Georges Leygues, scheduled for February 24, will be postponed, and the construction of the 35,000-ton cruiser Strasbourg will also be delayed. Today, the joint labor-management committee specially convened a meeting to reconcile the dispute between the two parties, but the vote of the factory representatives unanimously approved the strike immediately. One of the factory representatives has now been sent to Le Havre to induce the workers working on the large merchant ship Normandie to stop work altogether. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: With the inauguration of the new Minister of Education Kawasaki, the government and the Minseito Party will become closer. It is worth noting how Mr. Kawasaki will adjust the relationship between the two parties in the future. Prime Minister Okada and the government leaders are sure that the change of the Minister of Education will not only have no major impact on the political situation, but also have the hope of improvement. Mr. Kawasaki said to reporters late at night on the 1st regarding this matter, "Now, the national unity cabinet system has been adopted in this unusual time, and I hope that the Seiyukai Party will also stand in the position of assisting the government. This idea will not change after I join the cabinet. After the election is over, I plan to negotiate with the Seiyukai Party and ask them to take a proactive position in supporting the current cabinet. The result can be in line with the national unity theory of the Okada cabinet. I think this move is not without benefit, but if I deal with changes in the political situation, it is not something that can be predicted at the moment." (Den-Tsushin dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Famous Play "Peony Pavilion" Gains Good Reviews in Vienna <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Vienna: Professor Hong Tao-sheng, a German who has lived in China for many years, has translated famous Chinese legends such as "Peony Pavilion" and "Romance of the West Chamber" into scripts and organized a troupe. He left Peking last summer to perform in Germany. Recently, he came to Austria from Germany and performed "Peony Pavilion" for the first time yesterday at the Hofburg Theater here. This is the first time that Chinese drama has been performed in Austria. The play "Peony Pavilion" was originally a famous legend of the 16th century. Yesterday, the protagonist Du Liniang was played by Ms. Younge Lucy. Ms. Younge's father is German, and her mother is Chinese. She has performed old Chinese dramas in Peking, Tianjin, and other places and has received extremely good reviews. This time, she came to Europe with a Chinese orchestra to play music for the play. There is no set on the stage, only a long black curtain is used as a background, and the actors perform in front of the curtain. Although there is no set, the sincerity of the performance is amazing. The entire play is translated into German poetry. The actors recite the lines and perform the movements at the same time. Although the movements have a fixed routine, they are not cumbersome and are very subtle. Only the facial expressions are not full. The first performance of the play was "Chunxiang's Study," followed by "A Dream in the Garden." Ms. Younge's performance, in the midst of singing and dancing, made the audience hold their breath and listen. This is very different from Western opera, which emphasizes loud singing and fast dancing. Although the Austrian people may not be able to understand it immediately, the intellectual class in Vienna has praised it endlessly. If the troupe continues to gain good reviews in other capitals in Europe, the Western stage will inevitably be gradually influenced by Chinese drama in the future and adopt its strengths, because the plot of Chinese drama is simple and can best lead people to return to the common psychology of mankind.

<h3 id="e75">Anxi Mining Work: Chen Ticheng Reports That Ore May Be Sold to Japan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Technician Talks About Hoping for Joint Chinese-Japanese Investment in Amoy Communication: The Anxi Mining Exploration Team organized by the Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, led by Zhao Xiujin, the director of the Anxi Iron Mine Exploration Project Office, and thirteen Japanese technicians from the South Manchuria Railway Company, set off from Amoy on January 3rd and arrived in Anxi County on the 4th. They gathered in Hukou on the 12th. The Japanese consulate in Amoy also sent consulate officials Ikeda and Fan Zhongchang to accompany them. However, after arriving in Hukou, they were unable to go to their destination, Pantian, due to the unrest caused by bandits in the mountains. The two consulate officials, Ikeda and Fan, returned to Amoy on the 14th. Later, with the protection of the Sixth Security Regiment, the mining exploration team arrived in Pantian in late January and started working separately. After the mining exploration team entered Anxi, local schools and organizations, not knowing the details, rose up to oppose them. Later, after the county government and the Sixth Regiment explained that this was an exploration and the Japanese technicians were actually hired, the public opinion gradually subsided. As for the deputy director Lin Chao-chin, he led four Japanese technicians and set off from Amoy by water on January 3rd, traveling up the Jiulong River to Hua'an Zhangping, surveying the water conservancy and harbors along the way, and returning to Amoy on the 12th. The Japanese technicians Igarashi and Soma returned to Taiwan. This mining exploration work is divided into four parts: 1. Surveying the estuary, harbors, and waterways for transportation. 2. Investigating the railway line and land transportation from Anxi to the estuary. 3. Exploring the mine. 4. Test drilling. Each part is equipped with Japanese technicians from the South Manchuria Railway. 1. The survey of harbors and waterways has been completed. 2. The survey of the railway line. 3. Mine exploration. These two items can be completed in two or three months. 4. Test drilling. This will take ten months. It is necessary to use a diamond drill bit to drill three holes 200 meters deep to measure the amount of mineral reserves. The work is very complicated. Regarding the Anxi mining exploration, Chen Ticheng, the Director of the Construction Department, recently reported at a memorial weekly meeting of the provincial government, roughly saying, "The Anxi iron mine was surveyed in the first step last March and April. As a result, it was recognized that the mineral quality is very good, with iron accounting for 66% to 67%, manganese accounting for 3%, and sulfur and phosphorus accounting for 0.05%. The rest are impurities. Among the iron mines that have been mined in our country, the mineral quality in Hubei and Anhui provinces is the best, but iron only accounts for 50%. Therefore, the mineral reserves in Anxi are the most abundant. According to the report of the Geological Survey Institute of our country, there are 10 million tons of reserves in Pantian alone, and Japanese experts estimate that the total amount reaches 48 million tons. To this end, the second step of drilling is carried out. Drilling machines are extremely expensive and difficult to purchase on our own. Therefore, we borrowed them from the Japanese side and hired several Japanese technicians to work in four parts. The harbor and railway parts are needed for land and water transportation after mining, so they are also involved. If the investigation results show that it is worth mining, a decision can be made. There are two main outlets for mineral production: 1. Establishing our own iron smelting plant. 2. Selling the ore. Judging from the situation in our province, iron smelting requires coal and limestone, but the output in our province is very small. Bai coal in Longyan is not suitable, and although there is bituminous coal in northern Fujian, transportation is not easy. When selling broken ore, where should the market be, will also be considered. The iron ore in Hubei and Anhui is mostly sold to Japan. If the Anxi mine is mined, in addition to promoting the ore to various parts of our country, it may also need to be sold to Japan." After the Japanese technicians Igarashi and Soma returned to Taiwan, Igarashi gave a speech saying, "Mr. Soma, Yoshida, and I have worked together in the South Manchuria Railway Company for many years. This time, we are sincerely invited by the Fujian Provincial Government to have the opportunity to practice the iron mountain range in southern Fujian. The mineral area that our team inspected in Hua'an Zhangping is very easy to establish a transportation route linking Xiamen and the central terminal. The ore output is definitely a natural wealth with endless reserves, and there is no technical problem. We also hope that the two friendly countries, China and Japan, will be further friendly and invest together in development." (February 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e76">Special Relief Products of Fujian Province: Last Year, Fuzhou's Imports Exceeded Exports by More Than 3 Million; Provincial Government Plans to Formulate Measures for Relieving Special Products <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The three products of tea, timber, and paper in Fujian Province are indeed the province's major special products. In the past, tea and timber exports from Fuzhou alone were valued at over 10 million yuan annually. Now, they are only worth three to four million yuan. Paper exports from Fuzhou were valued at over four million yuan annually; now, they are only worth over 800,000 yuan. Consequently, many trading houses in Fuzhou dealing in these products have closed down, and many farmers and workers in the upper reaches of the Min River who plant and manufacture these products have also lost their jobs. Upon investigation, the reasons are: Firstly, northern Fujian has suffered from banditry for many years, and most farmers have fled, leaving the mountains uncultivated, resulting in a significant reduction in production. Secondly, most of the paper was sold to the three northeastern provinces. Since the fall of those provinces, the puppet state has established customs and imposed high import taxes. Most of the timber was sold to various parts of North China. In recent years, the situation in North China has been unstable, and the market has been declining daily. Most of the tea was sold to various islands in Southeast Asia. Recently, the market has been captured by tea from Ceylon and India. As a result, Fuzhou's foreign trade, which used to be a surplus port, saw imports exceed exports by more than three million yuan last year. Last autumn, the provincial government's statistics office conducted a survey of the province's special products, concluding that if no active measures were taken to relieve these three special products, the province's economic future would have little hope. However, this is a significant matter, and after detailed planning, it has recently been decided that, concerning the relief of the paper industry, the first step will be to reduce taxes. Starting from March 1st of this year, the special business tax on paper products will be reduced by one-third of the original tax rate, and the business tax on paper manufacturing will also be changed to a levy of 0.5%. This has been communicated to the Fuzhou Tax Bureau and the governments of various paper-producing counties in northwestern Fujian for compliance. Regarding the relief of the tea industry, it has been decided to guide tea farmers to improve their production methods. As the new spring tea is about to bud, the local governments of tea-producing counties are immediately ordered to organize rural cooperatives. The provincial government will allocate 300,000 yuan to be lent to the cooperatives for re-lending to farmers as funds for improving tea production. Regarding the relief of the timber industry, since the end of last winter, North China</p>

<h3 id="e77">Fierce Competition in Japan's "Election Purification" (3) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Hengzhi</p>
<p>——As a Transition for War Preparations in "Extraordinary Times"——</p>
<p>The Social Mass Party advocates for "nationalization of important industries" and prioritizes "domestic reform first." Their central platform is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Construction of Labor Parliament Politics</p>
<p>(2) Opposition to Mass Tax Increases</p>
<p>(3) Immediate Implementation of a National Pension System</p>
<p>(4) Establishment of Public Industrial and Commercial Financial Institutions</p>
<p>(5) Nationalization of Important Industries</p>
<p>(6) National Compensation for Agricultural Losses</p>
<p>The central slogans of the Social Mass Party are:</p>
<p>(1) Domestic Reform First</p>
<p>(2) National Defense Can Only Be Secure with a Prosperous Populace</p>
<p>(3) The Past? The Future? Already a Political Party? The Mass Party?</p>
<p>They assess the situation in various times and places and appropriately select these slogans. Although they did not win more than ten seats in the initial elections, they have proven that tens of thousands of working masses support them. Of course, in the "extraordinary times" situation, the future of parliamentary competition is also very limited.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "national unity" of the current cabinet and the Minseitō (Constitutional Democratic Party), there are naturally many inconsistencies between facts and propaganda. The reverse side of "purifying the election" is the existence of "non-purification." This is a problem that cannot be eliminated in capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Looking at the policies and slogans of the above parties, what is displayed before us is:</p>
<p>(1) The Seiyūkai (Rikken Seiyūkai - Friends of Constitutional Government Party) clearly represents the current will of a part of the financial capitalists: both industrial and national defense. On this point, although the Minseitō even shouts "three aspects of national defense, industry, and finance," from the point of view that the Minseitō is the current cabinet party, this proposition is not as powerful as the Seiyūkai, and also contains some differences in composition. Because since the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese territory, whether economic, political, or military, has already expanded. However, the expansion of the military territory has been faster. In order to cultivate and strengthen the existing foundations on this expanded territory, some parts of financial capital must hope for a longer period of stability. If this longer period of stability does not exist, then not only will the profits of capital not be sufficient, but the burden of increased military spending will not be easily compensated. Since this increased burden cannot be fully borne by the colonies, a part of it has to be placed on the domestic working masses. However, at present, except for the military-related industries, there is no particularly prosperous time. Adding to the burden of the masses will ignite domestic problems. Therefore, even if the alias "extraordinary times" is used for the "major current situation," it is impossible not to sing "national defense and industry together."</p>
<p>(2) On the anti-fascist point, the Social Mass Party shouts out this slogan, and the Minseitō also publicly defines it as one of its political platforms. The Seiyūkai avoids this frontal conflict. However, both the Seiyūkai and the Minseitō advocate parliamentary politics, so they also have some anti-fascist substance and appearance. Since the Manchurian Incident, various kinds of fascist tendencies have gradually become clear; however, a unified fascist party has not yet fully formed. This also means that the fascism of the small bourgeois mass movement incited by a certain faction of financial capital has not fully formed in Japan. However, judging from the anti-fascist slogans shouted by several factions in this election, the fascist forces are also not small; at the same time, we can see its military power.</p>
<p>(3) Judging from the Japanism advocated by the Kokumin Dōmei (National League), and even more from its advocacy of the consistency of military action and diplomatic action, this is clearly aimed at the other parties. However, it does not want to say that it is fascist. However, it undoubtedly advocates strengthening Japan's continental policy. Of course, as it currently appears, the number of people he can be elected to will at most not exceed twenty or thirty people.</p>
<p>(4) What has attracted the attention of all parties is the participation of the Social Mass Party of the proletariat camp in the election. The parliamentary struggles of the Proletarian Party in countries such as Germany have had many successes and failures. In the sense of expressing a certain aspect of the will of the labor group, striving for public propaganda, and allowing it to openly express anti-fascism, it is certainly sufficient to attract the attention of all parties. In fact, the fascist forces, starting from the officials, have already been infiltrated into a part of the working masses. "The construction of labor parliament politics" cannot be produced at present, but it can be shouted like this. "Opposing the increase of mass taxes" may have some effect. "Nationalization of important industries" - this will be used for military control of the national economy, right? In short, this should be seen as their current possible public movement. In one of their slogans, "implement domestic reform first," this is the most different place from other factions.</p>
<p>(5) Although the general election on February 20 has not yet arrived, the decision of the parliament and the cabinet can be roughly inferred from the current election situation. The Kokumin Dōmei, Showakai (Showa Society), Social Mass Party, etc. in the 466 prescribed seats, at most, can occupy sixty or so seats. Because the Kokumin Dōmei and the Showakai are the most supportive of the government - even the Kokumin Dōmei is supportive of the military, the number of seats will have an increasing trend. The current Seiyūkai and Minseitō are competing for the first party. In the initial election, the Minseitō had twenty or thirty fewer seats than the Seiyūkai, and because of the current cabinet's assistance, it is working hard to surpass the Seiyūkai, and in fact, it is indeed somewhat possible to surpass it. However, the situation has been slightly determined, and the seats of these two major parties will not be very different. These two major parties were born from the same mother (Japanese capitalism), and it doesn't matter much who is in power. However, if the Minseitō gets a majority of seats, it will be more glorious for the current cabinet's face. But if you don't listen to the military's command of more than 50%, you can't do it, so the so-called anti-fascism is equal to being anti-yourself. If the Seiyūkai occupies a majority, the cabinet will naturally collapse without face, but the reform marked out by the Seiyūkai is not fundamentally different from the current cabinet. Moreover, if you don't coordinate with the military, even if the Seiyūkai cabinet is established, it will not last long. The Japanese military has a fundamental difference from the military of other countries, that is: the military's independence. For example, it can conduct diplomacy independently without going through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Under the name of military secrecy, the military can directly report to the highest sovereign. As for the masses of the military, there are many "Zaikōgun" (reservist associations) and "Seinen Dan" (youth groups), and they have some influence on the small and medium-sized citizens. Therefore, in this "extraordinary time," whether the Seiyūkai wins or the Minseitō wins, they have to look at the military's face. As for the cabinet of decision, whether the Seiyūkai wins or the Minseitō wins, the cabinet candidates must have a close relationship with the military. If there is no close relationship, there is no possibility of a longer period of existence. If the number of seats in the Kokumin Dōmei increases, it indicates that "Japanism" is rising, and the "continental policy" will inevitably be strengthened, and the implementation of the military's will will be more based. However, as it currently appears, the number of seats in this faction will not exceed the Seiyūkai or the Minseitō. The high development of the Social Mass Party is currently impossible. Moreover, if there is considerable development, it will be differentiated and even suppressed, which is undoubtedly.</p>
<p>In short, it is still very depressing, as if a big storm is coming. The degree of depression is just like the economic status quo that seems to be prosperous but is not actually prosperous.</p>
<p>This decision, the result of the general election, can only show a further delineation of the battle lines in various layers. It is impossible to break through the depression. When the depression is broken through, it must be the advent of war. Now it is still in the stage of actively preparing for war.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>The Italian-Ethiopian issue has not been resolved, the disarmament conference has failed, and Germany is demanding the return of colonies; during this period, Japan's demand that the powers recognize it as the center of stability in East Asia must be the best opportunity. According to reports, Soviet People's Commissar Molotov's speech stated that Japan and Germany have formed an alliance. Recently, Foreign Minister Hirota's speech, in addition to the so-called "three principles for China," also demanded that the Soviet Union withdraw the troops that have been increased in the Far East in recent years; in addition to military affairs, he also advocated free trade and opposed trade restrictions in various countries. This proposition of free trade shows that in today's recession, Japan's production index has already moved upward. It is also for this reason that its foreign policy dares to be tough. For these two reasons, the election of this decision, all factions naturally use "national defense" and "industry" as political slogans.</p>
<p>Japan is currently in the transition of military, political, and economic control and development, and this election is enough to show a further step forward. At the same time, the essence of the forces in each layer has gradually emerged. (End)</p>

<p>In the aspect of Fujian, the sales of fir have improved, and prices have also increased. Tianjin Zhuangyou urgently called for goods, and all timber firms are shipping them in large quantities. The timber yards along the Minjiang and Hongjiang rivers have very few stockpiled rafts, which is a good phenomenon not seen in the past five years. However, timber rafts from northern Fujian to the province must pay more than 20 taxes along the way. Timber merchants find the burden too heavy and difficult to profit from. It has now been decided to submit a petition to the provincial government, ordering the army, police, civil defense forces, and administrative agencies along the Minjiang River not to arbitrarily intercept and extract donations, in order to demonstrate maintenance.

<p>——Du Shigong Sentenced to Ten Years of Imprisonment——</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Wu Sheng, a bandit leader in western Fujian, the pseudo-member of the Southwestern Fujian Military Commission and the pseudo-commander of the 9th Regiment, Guo Yiwei, the pseudo-member of the Military Commission and the pseudo-Minister of Party Affairs, and Du Shigong, the pseudo-member of the Central Military Commission and the pseudo-Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Fujian Military Commission, were successively captured in Fanshuikou, Yongding, in January. Du surrendered and wrote a letter of repentance, narrating the internal situation of the bandits. After the Longyan Second District Pacification Command inquired and reported to the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fujian, it was requested to handle it. An order was received to sentence the two bandits Wu and Guo to death, and Du was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The two bandits Wu and Guo were then executed by firing squad in Longyan on January 22nd, and the Second District Pacification Command announced the crimes of the two bandits as follows: "According to Ma Shuming, the commander of the 56th Regiment of the 10th Division, who escorted the captured bandit leaders Wu Sheng, Guo Yiwei, and Du Shigong to the department, after inquiring, Wu Sheng was a member of the pseudo-Southwestern Fujian Military Commission and the pseudo-commander of the 9th Regiment, and Guo Yiwei was a member of the pseudo-Southwestern Fujian Military Commission and the pseudo-Minister of Party Affairs. Since their behavior is extremely obvious and their work is indeed determined, they shall be sentenced to death in accordance with Articles 1, 3, and 2 of the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. As for the name Du Shigong, although he is currently the Chief of Staff of the pseudo-Southwestern Fujian Military Commission, after investigation, his will has long been depressed, and he has been punished by the bandits for disagreement, and has even been expelled from the party once. When he was surrounded at Shuikoushan in Yongding, he was the first to sing that he was willing to surrender. Later, he wrote a letter of repentance, exposing the various conspiracies and tricks of the bandits, and his determination to oppose the Communists. He had already realized this, unlike the bandits such as Wu and Guo who were lost and did not know how to return. According to the law, he was sentenced to a reduced term of ten years of imprisonment, and the case was presented to Chiang, the Pacification Commissioner in Fujian, for instructions on the 14th of this month. Now, we have received Hao Wei's telegram stating that the captured bandit leaders Wu Sheng and Guo Yiwei have been sentenced to death, and Shi Shigong has been sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, all of which are approved and shall be executed separately. This is announced to show a warning, including the execution of one bandit leader Wu Sheng, a native of Yongding, Fujian, 25 years old, and Guo Yiwei, a native of Shanghang, Fujian, 26 years old."

<p>Attacks and Occupies the Town, Causing Severe Harm</p>
<p>Henan Authorities Dispatch Troops to Strictly Defend</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Liu Guitang's bandit troops, in Luochuan, which is under the jurisdiction of Shunde in Hebei Province, were severely attacked by Lin Zuozhen's regiment of Shang Zhen's troops, and then fled southwest to Huoshui, which is under the jurisdiction of Wu'an in northern Henan. They were again attacked by Zhang Xiaoyuan's regiment of Shang's troops, who advanced westward from Yueshantou, and Sun Dingchao's regiment, who advanced northwestward from Wu'an. Fearing being surrounded on three sides, the bandits fled northwestward again on the evening of the 27th. On the 28th, they retreated from Datong and Houzhang Village, northwest of Wu'an, to the area of Shahejin, Jianzishui, and Motou. Shang Zhen's troops are still tracking and pursuing them. At the same time, the Henan Provincial Authorities dispatched Tang Junde's unit of the 95th Division to garrison Linxian and Shexian counties. The 5th and 14th Security Regiments garrisoned the Daqing Road to strictly guard the money. On the 29th, according to a telegram from Zhangde, Liu's bandit troops of 500 people had captured Yicheng Town, northeast of Wu'an, causing severe harassment. It is recalled that when Liu's bandits fled to Henan in the 22nd year, they first went to Wu'an and Shexian counties, and then crossed the river from Mengxian County, causing harm to 65 counties in Henan Province. To this day, the general public still turns pale at the mention of it, so they all hope that the authorities will quickly quell it. (January 31st)</p>

<p>The county government has recently ordered the district chiefs to investigate the self-renewal registration of opium smokers. Although it has exceeded 2,000 people, it is feared that there are still many omissions. Once the general inspection period arrives, unlicensed opium smokers will be punished, which is contrary to the government's intention of prudent imprisonment and compassionate sentencing. Therefore, yesterday, the county government convened a meeting of district chiefs and armed agencies to discuss effective methods of investigation. It was decided that starting from the 3rd, armed teams will be assigned to conduct simultaneous investigations by district. Ren Yingcang, the anti-opium commissioner specially dispatched by the Department of Civil Affairs, attended the meeting to declare the measures to promote the self-renewal registration of opium smokers. The district chiefs returned to their districts on the 2nd to convene township heads to strive to promote self-renewal registration. The situation is very tense. The county government also dispatched personnel to the districts to supervise. With such unity from top to bottom, unlicensed opium smokers can be cleared up, which is beneficial to the future of opium suppression.</p>

<p>Yao Cheng, a villager from Fanbang Township, Fengjing, who was nearly sixty years old, had one wife and one concubine. His wife, Cheng, was from Qingliang Nunnery. The couple's relationship was usually ordinary. On the morning of the second day of the new year, Cheng poured ash from the stove into the car shed. The embers reignited and burned three teeth of the car. The couple had an argument. Cheng, in a moment of anger, secretly swallowed ash and committed suicide. The Procuratorate received a letter from Ye Liuqiao and four other citizens of Qingliang Nunnery reporting a murder. The office immediately sent the chief bailiff Xue Bingzhang to the countryside to investigate. There was no Ye Liuqiao, and it was found that the above-mentioned situation had been reported. The office, considering that the case concerned a human life, specially sent prosecutor Lu Qi to the countryside for inspection.</p>

<p>Luo Zhi, the president of the Jiangdu District Court, believes that real estate registration is the only way to protect the private rights of the people and prevent unnecessary litigation. In all modern countries ruled by law, the source of litigation can be clarified and the trial can be facilitated, mostly because of the remarkable effectiveness of the registration system. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, there was already the promulgation of the Real Estate Registration Ordinance. In provinces where it was implemented in accordance with the regulations, the people felt convenient. However, in Jiangdu, the registration has not been carried out due to the imperfect organization of the court, which has made the people's private rights lack definite protection, made investigation difficult in civil litigation, and made lawsuits over objections to enforcement frequently appear. The request for filing is also just a cover-up. He specially reported to the High Court and instructed the court to establish a real estate registration office in accordance with the law to carry out registration, so as to rectify the origin and clarify the source. It has now started working on the 1st, and announced to the public that those with land rights should come to the court to register and receive certificates.</p>

<p>— Duanyuan</p>
<p>Since the Yangtze River flood in the twentieth year of the Republic, major water and drought disasters have succeeded each other continuously. The central government has mobilized to respond tirelessly, and the funds allocated have reached tens of millions of yuan. Judging from historical records, the disaster relief policies of past dynasties may not have surpassed our government's, which is what our government can tell the people with satisfaction. However, relief administration differs in its nature and methods from other government affairs, and the establishment of a specialized department is still in its infancy in our country's political system. The efforts of the past have been recognized by the people of the country, and the effectiveness of the future should be improved. Yesterday, this newspaper published Consultant Baker's "Central Disaster Relief Organization Policy," which is based on his twenty years of experience in disaster relief in China. His words may be what people have not said, or what everyone can say, but it is different from the empty talk of those who simply follow ideals, and it has value for research and discussion. Now, I will discuss a few points with the readers.</p>
<h3 id="e90">1. Methods of Providing Relief <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The current method of providing relief is to investigate first and then release. After the investigation and release personnel arrive in a county with the funds, they are instructed by the local administrative personnel to prepare a register of disaster victims, which is reported from the district to the county, and then collected by the county. After the investigation and release personnel receive the register, they conduct a household-by-household review of the register, and at the same time issue relief tickets. They select a date and location, and the disaster victims hold the tickets to receive relief. After this procedure is completed, the relief funds enter the hands of the disaster victims. It takes a short time to dispatch the investigation and release personnel, remit the relief funds, and transport the relief goods. However, the preparation of the register and the review of the register take a lot of time. According to past experience, in places with convenient transportation, it cannot be completed in two or three months, let alone in other places with blocked transportation. However, the register is not accurate, and the review may be obscured. Recently, newspapers and magazines, in short stories about rural disaster relief, often have quite unforgiving expressions regarding the fairness and timeliness of the current method. This is a general and honest reaction, and those who handle relief should pay serious attention and seek improvement in methods. The work-relief method mentioned by Mr. Baker can be recognized as a more time-saving and fair method. It can avoid the complexity of investigation and its malpractices, and in addition to saving lives, it can also have the positive effect of construction. In the future, it should be adopted as much as possible to replace the old method of emergency relief. However, this kind of work-relief plan must be planned in advance, so that it can be implemented immediately after a disaster occurs. It is by no means the so-called work-relief that is currently available, but after the disaster occurs, the available funds are allocated, and then the survey and design are carried out, and workers are called to implement it. Not only does it take longer than emergency relief, but also the recruitment of foreign workers leads to the suspicion of disturbing farmers. The work-relief mentioned by Mr. Baker, in my opinion, should be that the central and local construction agencies pre-approve the construction projects to be carried out in various places in the next three or four years, and make budgets. If there is a bumper year, then workers will be conscripted or urged to complete them in order. If there is a famine year, then work can be started in advance according to the order, and the disaster can be completed by labor. If this is the case, then the country has a construction budget of one yuan, which is a disaster relief budget of one yuan. Disaster relief can promote construction, and construction can relieve disaster at the same time. This is why work-relief is preferable.</p>
<h3 id="e91">2. The Allocation of Relief Funds <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The final distribution of relief funds is executed by the investigation and release personnel. If the investigation and release personnel lack the ability, or for various public and private reasons, they do not release the funds, or they do not release them in the right way or at the right time, then the value of that part of the relief funds is lost. Therefore, if the allocation of relief funds is to be appropriate and the utilization is to be flexible, the central agency, whether it is a government agency or a people's organization, should have the power to control and supervise the relief funds from beginning to end. The entire amount of relief funds should not be allocated at once after distribution, but should be allocated for each use to achieve the function of jurisdiction and adjustment. Mr. Baker's proposal is based on experience and is based on the fact that it has always been easy for various groups and agencies to allocate relief funds, but it is difficult to settle accounts, and it is often delayed for more than two or three years. This is why rumors arise and trust is lost. Mr. Baker's method, in short, is the fixed-amount revolving fund system in accounting. Since this system has been implemented in various commercial and administrative agencies, I do not see why it cannot be adopted in the expenditure of relief funds as well.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Section 3: The Organization of the Highest Authority <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The central highest authority, which presides over national revitalization affairs, bears a more significant administrative responsibility for China, a nation afflicted by numerous disasters, than any other institution. To fully leverage its functions and fulfill its duties, it must, of course, have adequate funding and specialized personnel as prerequisites. Although various ministries and commissions are tightening their belts due to today's financial constraints, this authority should be treated as a special case, given the pressing needs arising from our country's unique circumstances. However, the officials appointed to take charge should comprehend the gravity of their mission and approach the handover of duties with utmost solemnity, ensuring that public funds are not wasted. The general ills of Chinese administrative institutions are that nothing gets done due to a lack of funds, existing only as window dressing. Conversely, if funds are sufficient, they are busy accommodating superfluous personnel, still achieving nothing. It is hoped that such a state of affairs will not manifest in the revitalization administrative authority. Considering the close relationship between revitalization and other administrative aspects, the highest-ranking official should be appointed from among those who are advanced in years, possess high moral character and profound prestige, for the sake of administrative convenience. The members of its core staff must be selected based on their abilities, and its leaders should be staffed with dedicated individuals possessing rich disaster relief experience, enthusiasm, knowledge, physical strength, the ability to endure hardship, the capacity for progress, diligence, fearlessness in the face of difficulty, and full commitment. Consultant Baker concluded that if China had competent revitalization leaders, its disaster relief capabilities would be no less than those of any country in the world. We firmly believe this.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Why Do We Study Mathematics? And How Do We Study Mathematics? (Part 1) Professor of Great China University <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Mengxian</p>
<p>(Lecture to secondary school students nationwide on January 9th and 11th of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936])</p>
<p>"Mathematics," as a discipline, has always been valued in schools—especially in secondary schools. Despite the considerable efforts of teachers and students, the performance, as seen in statistical reports, remains poor and, according to some, is the worst. Moreover, in recent years, the results of the high school entrance examinations in various provinces and cities, as well as the entrance examinations for various universities, consistently show mathematics as the weakest subject. What is the reason for this? Whose responsibility is it? The issues of provincial and municipal entrance examinations and university admissions are beyond the scope of this lecture; their merits and demerits should be discussed separately. If we focus solely on secondary schools themselves to investigate the reasons for the poor performance in mathematics and the responsibility for it, we can identify two aspects: teachers and students. I will now begin with what I wish to contribute to the students:</p>
<p>As far as I know, many students in certain secondary schools (in some schools, the majority) find mathematics uninteresting. Because it is uninteresting, they do not work hard; because they do not work hard, their performance worsens. Each school, every semester and school year, has a mathematics failure rate that often exceeds one-quarter. This has become a norm in calculating grades. But why are students not interested in mathematics? There are three explanations for this:</p>
<p>Some say that most students do not need to study mathematics. Because they do not feel the need, they are not interested. I believe that education must adapt to needs, which is certainly true. However, the question is, is there fundamentally no need, or is the need not being stimulated? You will understand as you hear more below.</p>
<p>Some say that not every student is capable of learning mathematics. Analyzing the minds of young people, some are inclined towards the humanities, others towards the sciences. It is inappropriate to force everyone to learn mathematics. I believe this reason is highly inadequate. We can say that every student may not become a mathematician, but to say that someone is born unable to learn mathematics is an unfounded assertion. Because the mathematics taught in secondary schools and even ordinary universities (excluding mathematics departments) is limited to the elementary level, as long as one grasps the process and advances step by step, it is not at all difficult. To say that one cannot learn even this much is unduly self-defeating.</p>
<p>Some say that even if students feel the need for mathematics and do not consider themselves unsuited to it, they still find mathematics troublesome and monotonous. I believe that trouble and monotony are unavoidable phenomena in life. We know that the universe is diverse, but from another perspective, it is also very monotonous. For example, the Earth revolves around the Sun, moving step by step, passing second by second. How monotonous is that! If it suddenly felt bored and stopped or sped up slightly, what would happen to the world?</p>
<p>According to these three explanations, students lack a strong interest in learning, which is indeed a reason for poor performance. However, the interest in learning can be cultivated. How to stimulate needs? How to shift individual biases? And how to develop habits? These are not unsolvable problems. Before presenting learning methods, I will first explain the purpose of studying mathematics.</p>
<p>First, studying mathematics can provide tools for scientific research. If we want to survive in the world in the future, we must study science; and the foundation of all sciences is built upon mathematics. The natural sciences in elementary school and the physics and chemistry in junior high school only explain the superficial aspects of natural phenomena and may not require the help of mathematics. However, in high school, one often needs to use arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry to calculate problems in physics and chemistry. Such as the distance and time of movement; the composition and function of forces; the pressure and specific gravity of water and air; the absorption and release of heat and the expansion and contraction of objects; the progression of light and the propagation of waves; the strength of electric current and the magnitude of resistance; as well as calculations of atomic weight, molecular weight, periodic law, chemical equivalent, chemical equations, etc.—where is mathematics not needed? If we go further, any scientific book, if it is somewhat specialized, can be flipped open and one will see short d's, long s's, continuously recorded in lengthy passages. This is the most powerful and effective tool for science—calculus. Without calculus, the material civilization of the twentieth century would not have developed to its current level. But if we cannot learn arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, we cannot learn calculus, which means we cannot study science. Because mathematics is the stepping stone to studying science, mathematics is the science for studying science. The reason we find science so difficult is that our mathematical foundation is poor and our tools are incomplete. If one has a considerable cultivation of mathematics, one can gradually delve deeper, understand science, and reach the point of invention and creation to benefit society and humanity.</p>
<p>Second, studying mathematics can solve problems in daily life. In clothing, food, housing, transportation, production, consumption, whenever there is a quantitative relationship, we must apply mathematical knowledge to meet the needs of our interaction with the world. This is the most obvious, most intimate, and universally felt and encountered benefit, which I need not elaborate on.</p>
<p>Third, studying mathematics can guide the correct path of life. We can say that we do not hope to become mathematicians, do not plan to study science, and even say that we do not need the convenience of life, but we cannot say that we do not want to be human. Mathematics is also a philosophy that guides us on how to be human, because the characteristics of mathematics are often in direct opposition to various undesirable phenomena in society. To list a few:</p>
<p>Certainty vs. hypocrisy. Duplicity and inconsistency are more prevalent among those who claim to be civilized. Not only is this the case in a single society or nation, but an atmosphere of hypocrisy pervades the entire world. This disease can be cured with mathematics, because mathematics is absolutely certain and never lies. For example, one cannot be less than zero, and two plus three cannot equal four or six.</p>
<p>Strictness vs. sloppiness. Perfunctoriness and casualness are common attitudes, and "close enough" has become a catchphrase. This disease can also be cured with mathematics, because mathematics is very strict and never allows for carelessness. For example, can one be careless or casual when proving geometric theorems?</p>
<p>Order vs. disorder. People usually allow time and space to be inverted and disordered. Public gatherings are even more chaotic and disturbing. To remedy such chaotic phenomena, one can borrow the function of mathematics. Because mathematics is the most orderly, making a diagram or writing an equation requires following a specific procedure, arranging things neatly from front to back, left to right. If society could be like this, there would be no conflict.</p>
<p>Universality vs. exceptionalism. In other countries, only foreign guests representing their nations can enjoy the convenience of extraterritoriality. In our country, there are often people who enjoy preferential treatment outside the law. This special situation is most detrimental to the progress and unity of society and the nation. Recently, our enemies have used the pretext that a certain province has a special environment and a certain place requires special measures to oppress us. However, mathematics has no exceptions under a certain regulation. So-called universality is one of the characteristics of mathematics. With this training, there will be no drawbacks from claiming exceptions.</p>
<p>Broad and precise vs. narrowness. Narrowness is a trait of people, because they have not studied solid geometry, or have studied it and have already forgotten it. Therefore, they lack a spatial concept, fighting desperately in the horns of a bull. Negligence is also a common state of people, because they have not learned precise algorithms. Therefore, they are careless and superficial, easily giving up, causing many mistakes. If we use mathematics to correct them, they will look up, broaden their horizons, become more meticulous, and become more peaceful.</p>
<p>I have said above that the reason students' interest in learning mathematics is not strong is because they are afraid of difficulty. Mathematics is indeed not an easy subject, but at the elementary level, this is not yet the case. Many problems, usually considered difficult, such as the application of four arithmetic operations and the initial proofs in geometry, have few methods and theorems that can be cited, making it difficult to obtain explanations that are exactly relevant to the problem. Another example is solving simultaneous quadratic equations and proving trigonometric and inverse trigonometric function identities, which require many steps and are difficult to reach the final step. In fact, these types of problems are just sometimes too simple, sometimes more complex, but not difficult. Because they are ultimately not impossible, not unsolvable, like the loci that cannot be constructed in elementary geometry or algebraic equations above the fifth degree, those are truly difficult problems! Also, it is natural to feel difficult when teaching trigonometry and analytical geometry to someone who has never studied any geometry. If you follow the order from the first year of junior high school to the third year of high school, step by step, what difficulty is there? Therefore, scholars only need to pay attention to the following three points in their actual learning, and there will be no so-called difficulty.</p>
<p>Theory must be concise. A discipline, or a part of it, always has a theory on which it is based, and each must have its center of argument. Although elementary mathematics is very simple, it also has simple theories. But if you can grasp the key points, the rest will be easily solved and will not be a problem. For example, the solution of algebraic equations is based on the principle of "gradually finding equivalent equations of the original equation"; the most important thing in analytical geometry is the theorem that "points whose coordinates are the roots of the equation are all on the locus represented by the equation, and any point taken on the locus, its coordinates are all suitable for the equation"; as long as these key points are truly recognized, appropriately summarized, and grasped, they can be applied infinitely.</p>
<p>The system must be clear. Scientific methods value classification. Although the content may be mixed and the conditions may be numerous, each has its system and the possibility of classes. The most clearly structured in mathematics is geometry, with one theorem, one definition, extending one by one, allowing no disorder. Another example is that numbers in algebra can be interpreted as generalized arithmetic numbers, so various algorithms in algebra can be regarded as extensions of arithmetic; and the establishment of the number system gradually expands from integers and fractions to irrational numbers and imaginary numbers, thus combining into the large range of complex numbers. All of these are very orderly and meaningful connections in mathematics. If scholars can distinguish them clearly, they will not feel complex.</p>
<p>Basic methods must be proficient. Studying mathematics is not only about understanding, but also about proficiency. As explained earlier, many principles and methods come from the shallow to the deep, layered and tortuous, so you must start from the very first step, practice step by step, and become proficient in the whole body. Students who fail algebra and trigonometry do not fail because they do not understand the theory of algebra and trigonometry, but because they are not familiar with the calculation of numbers, so the answer has no result; analytical geometry cannot be tested, not because the properties of the quadric curve are not clear, nor because the method of graphing is not known, but because the algebraic equations cannot be organized, the geometric theorems cannot be applied, and the trigonometric formulas cannot be manipulated freely; any teacher who has looked at the test paper can point out the students' shortcomings. Therefore, when we study mathematics, we should pay attention to practice, and even more should pay attention to basic practice.</p>
<p>As for some problems that are not difficult, but are inevitably complicated, this is undeniable. But if we acknowledge the importance of science, we must cultivate people who are proficient in science, so we must train minds that are suitable for science and spirits that are in line with science. This attitude and habit of not being afraid of trouble, being patient, being diligent, burying one's head in hard work, can be deeply cultivated and actively tempered when studying mathematics, so as to be prepared to undertake more complex and difficult work in the future. What is the complexity of mathematical formulas?</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen! The vast natural world and the brilliant academic world have yet to be explored and developed by us. Do not belittle yourselves. Hurry up and work hard. Who knows if you will become an inventor in the future? Is it impossible to make contributions in mathematics and bring great light to mankind? As long as you are not afraid of difficulties, do not settle for ease, raise unlimited interest, make a very big determination, and you can always achieve your goals and benefit the world! Archimedes was studying geometry when enemy soldiers had already arrived at the window, yet he was still thinking deeply without stopping. This is the true spirit of studying mathematics, and the best way to achieve the greatest purpose of studying mathematics.</p>
<p>In short, studying mathematics can correct various bad habits in society; it can guide our view of life; although achieving this goal is not the function of mathematics itself, it cannot but be considered a good prescription for saving the dying customs.</p>
<p>Now that the purpose is clear, we can discuss methods. How do we study mathematics, or rather, how do we make our mathematics performance good? Teachers certainly have a great responsibility; but teachers can only find ways to stimulate students' interest in mathematics based on their goals of learning mathematics, and find ways to guide them to work hard. For example, if a child cannot walk, adults can only lead them to walk, not walk for them. Whether mathematics performance is good or not still depends on whether the students themselves work hard or not. So today my point of view focuses on the students' side.</p>
<p>Current students can be divided into five levels, and those who are unwilling to work hard and have no awareness are not included. The last level of these five levels is the students who only wake up after failing the exam, but do not know how to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, and do not hurry to think of remedial methods, but only know how to argue with the teacher about the score; the fourth level is the students who know their past mistakes after failing the exam and study hard; although his hard work is too late, but it is already much better than the last level!</p>

<h3 id="e94">Issuance of Consolidated and Reconstruction Bonds Receives Positive Response from Various Sectors <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Old Bonds to be Withdrawn and Exchanged Once New Bonds are Printed</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange Decides to Temporarily Suspend Auctions</p>
<p>Sound Financial System with Eight Major Banks Completed</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, after the Ministry of Finance issued 146 million yuan of Consolidated Bonds and 34 million yuan of Reconstruction Bonds on February 1st, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange temporarily suspended auctions. Once the new bonds are printed, the old bonds will be withdrawn and exchanged, while simultaneously promoting a sound financial system and supporting production and construction. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Old Bonds and Exchange for New Bonds</p>
<p>After the issuance of 146 million yuan of Consolidated Bonds on February 1st, the National Public Bond Holders Association first issued a declaration of support. Now the Ministry of Finance has expedited the printing of the Consolidated Bonds. Once printing is completed, the following categories will be withdrawn: (A) six types including the 22nd Year Patriotic Treasury Bonds; (B) five types including the 19th Year Rehabilitation Treasury Bonds; (C) nine types including the 18th Year Disbandment Treasury Bonds; (D) eight types including the 19th Year Customs Bonds; and (E) five types including the 22nd Year Customs Treasury Bonds. Old bonds will be withdrawn and exchanged for new bonds.</p>
<p>Securities Trading Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance sent Xu Zhichu and others to supervise the delivery of securities at the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange and stipulated that, regardless of new or old transactions, sellers must provide the actual goods to be stored at the Central Trust Bureau, the Brokers Association convened a meeting to request a remedy. The Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend trading until the investigation of speculation and manipulation is completed. Although yesterday was Sunday and a day of rest, it is said that the Exchange has decided to temporarily suspend auctions. The date of resumption will depend on the order of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Principal Redemption Every Six Months</p>
<p>The 16th principal redemption of the first tranche of the 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds, the 7th principal redemption of the 7% Treasury Bonds, and the 7th principal redemption of the 6% Treasury Bonds were announced by the Ministry of Finance in Announcement No. 128 on January 27th, stipulating that the lottery for principal redemption would be held at the Shanghai Banking Association on February 10th. The Banking and Currency Exchange Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were instructed to send personnel to supervise. Now, because the above three types of bonds have been merged into the Consolidated Bonds, the 20th Year Disaster Relief Bonds as Category D, and the 6% and 7% Treasury Bonds as Category E, the planned lottery for principal redemption on February 10th will be temporarily suspended. It is noted that the Consolidated Bonds stipulate that principal and interest will be redeemed by lottery every six months.</p>
<p>Sound System to Support Production</p>
<p>To complete the legal currency policy, establish a sound financial system, support production and construction, balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, and stabilize the bond market fund, after the Ministry of Finance issued 34 million yuan of Reconstruction Bonds on February 1st, the Ministry of Finance has actively proceeded with the above-mentioned designated uses. Such as completing the eight major banks, reorganizing the Central Bank into a reserve bank, becoming a bank of banks, and establishing a real estate bank, etc., scheduled to be realized one by one before the end of this year.</p>
<p>Various Industries Support the Policy</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency reporter, investigations from major industries yesterday revealed that China's industry and commerce have been severely affected by the global recession, resulting in unusual decline. Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the new currency system policy on November 4th last year, there has been no concern about a lack of currency in the market, and various industries have been invigorated. The difficult hurdle of the general conclusion of 1935 has also been safely overcome. Now the government's issuance of Reconstruction Bonds, the establishment of a sound financial system, and support for production are the only appropriate measures. It is said that endorsements will be declared one after another. The revival of agriculture, industry, and commerce can also be foreseen.</p>
<p>Minister Kong to Report to Capital Tonight</p>
<p>After Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi discussed with leaders of the financial and industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai and the Public Bond Holders Association the issuance of the Consolidated Bonds and Reconstruction Bonds, it is said that he is scheduled to take the Shanghai-Nanjing night express train to the capital tonight to attend the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on Tuesday to report on the handling of the bond cases.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Silver Trade to Convene National Delegates' Meeting <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Purity of Silver Ornaments</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silver Trade Guild held a members' meeting at its premises at 2 PM on the first day of the month (yesterday). Present were all the executive committee members Ying Xiansan, Fu Shengmao, Fei Zushou, Kong Lanfang, Xu Zhifang, Yao Guiqing, and more than twenty member representatives including Yan Zhiyun, Lin Xiaoyu, and Yu Yongsui. The meeting was chaired by Fu Shengmao. The chairman reported that the guild received a directive from the Ministry of Finance on the 23rd of last month (the last day of the lunar year), regarding the requested "Regulations for the Management of Silver Products," altering certain provisions. Members were immediately notified that very night. However, due to the general business closure for the holidays, a meeting could not be convened. The chairman consulted with members yesterday and found them deeply anxious and fearful. The only recourse is to submit another request to the Ministry of Finance, seeking approval to adhere to the exception clause in Article 11 of the Management Regulations.</p>
<p>A certain shop replaced a silver cup with the "Yang Qinghe" brand with one made of copper. The police brought a public prosecution, and the First Special District Court ruled against them. The guild has entrusted legal counsel, Lawyer Xi Yuchang, to publish a notice, advising all sectors to be cautious when commissioning silver articles, especially if they are not refurbished or re-decorated by silver shops. Mr. Gu Suming, the chief representative of the Zhejiang Province Silver Trade, sent a letter yesterday, stating he will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, intending to jointly initiate a call with this guild to gather representatives from all gold and silver factions nationwide to come to Shanghai for discussions, and make a large-scale petition. After the report, Fu continued to express his views, stating in brief: The Ministry of Finance's directive states that various countries now use chemical silver, but national customs differ between East and West. Foreign production uses machines and electricity, while our country uses lamps, bellows, hands, and brains. Learning begins in childhood and continues into old age. Changes in patterns are determined by the needs of the times. This refers to workmanship. When foreigners purchase utensils and ornaments, they discard them once they are old or broken. In our country, social customs value the quality of silver ornaments and utensils, using them for savings. When funds are needed, these ornaments are pawned. Therefore, buyers first inquire about the regular price and are unwilling to simply discard them. This refers to the psychology and customs of our society. Our trade has always used pure silver. Once it is changed to 30% silver, shops will lack electric machinery, and craftsmen's skills will be useless. Furthermore, jewelry cannot be made with 30% silver. After repeated consideration, jewelry must still be made of pure silver, but the sales volume is extremely small. However, interior traders mainly still use ornaments. The lowest quality utensils can be made with 70% silver, which would not be too difficult for workmanship. If 30% silver is used, I can assert that no one will care, and livelihoods will be driven to the brink of ruin. The Ministry of Finance preserves silver to maintain our country's economic lifeline, and its intentions are good. However, the amount of ornaments scattered among the people is limited. When the nation faces danger, every citizen will surely remove their hairpins and earrings to assist the country's urgent needs. The Italian people's aid to the national treasury has earned worldwide acclaim. Our people's patriotism is no less. I believe the Ministry of Finance will not cause millions of law-abiding workers to face unemployment, and so on. In the end, the third submission will be handled by the chairman with full authority, but it must be done quickly. Once completed, it should be directly submitted to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The organization of a national gold and silver trade joint petition group will wait until the Zhejiang Province representative arrives in Shanghai, after which detailed discussions will be held to decide the next course of action.</p>

<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from money traders yesterday that the money trade has been affected by the overall recession, resulting in most firms' profits being only around 50,000 yuan at most, with half of the industry barely breaking even. This year, they have unanimously adopted austerity measures, being particularly cautious with overdrafts, requiring reliable guarantors before granting credit. The annual meeting will be held on February 5th at the Inner Garden in the South City and on February 10th at the Money Trade Guild Hall in the North City. In addition to reporting on the meeting and paying respects to deceased elders, they will also discuss new business strategies. The Money Trade Joint Reserve Treasury has been quite effective since its establishment, with ample reserves. To save expenses, the assembly passed a resolution to return the old site at the mouth of Xingren Lane on Ningbo Road, and move to the hall downstairs in the Money Trade Guild building on Shanxi Road East on Ningbo Road, which is the Money Trade Market. Workers have been hired to renovate the space, and they will move in as soon as the work is completed.</p>

<p>The Business Is Seeing Development</p>
<p>The Future Is Quite Promising</p>
<h3 id="e106">Discussion by Standing Committee Member Pan <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News reports that the National Products Movement Joint Association, organized by various groups in this city, has been actively promoting national products since its establishment on the 10th of last month, dividing its efforts into domestic and international departments. A reporter from Xin Xin News visited Mr. Pan Yangyao, a standing committee member of the association, yesterday, who provided detailed information about the work situation, which is summarized as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Active Implementation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Pan, promoting national products is currently essential. Therefore, in recent years, many have been actively advocating for it. Since the National Products Year for Women and Students was held successively, there has been considerable success in promoting national products. Looking at the fact that the major factories in this city have safely survived two major New Year closures in the midst of a global recession, and that the customs bureau announced a surplus of five million yuan in December last year, it is evident that the public's love for national products is considerable. If manufacturers can continuously improve their products, and society continues to vigorously promote them, the future of national products is immeasurable. To ensure effectiveness, the association has drafted a general outline of a work plan and is actively implementing it.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Domestic Work <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>After the joint meeting of the domestic departments decided to focus on the Yangtze River area, the director of the department, Wang Xingyao, drafted a work outline, deciding to start with propaganda and actively organize a propaganda team to set off in three groups, each group consisting of three or four people, to conduct propaganda in Nanjing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Changsha, Hankou, Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing, and other places, and to discuss the consumption and promotion of national products. The director of the General Affairs Department, Wang Renzhi, and his party set off the night before last.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Overseas Work <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>After deciding to focus on Southeast Asia, the international department, under the direction of the director Zhang Huikang, formulated a work plan, deciding to start with a needs assessment and organize a Southeast Asia exploration team to explore the islands of Southeast Asia and Malaya, and to request the assistance of local embassies to achieve twice the result with half the effort. At the same time, a publication will be launched to facilitate propaganda. It is planned that these measures will be implemented separately after convening a meeting of the heads of the departments next week.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Discussion by Director Wang <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Zhong Yang News reports that the National Products business has been developing rapidly in recent years, and efforts to promote national products have been spared. The National Products Introduction Center, jointly established by major manufacturers in this city, has established national product companies all over the country. After the first establishment in Shanghai, it gradually spread to remote provinces. As of the end of last year, there were eight established locations, including Fuzhou and Xijing. One location in Chongqing has been in operation for half a year, but due to the construction of buildings, it only officially opened this year. According to the reporter's inquiry, the operating conditions in various locations are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Conditions in Various Locations <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the National Products Companies operating year-round in various locations included five places: Fuzhou, Zhenjiang, Zhengzhou, Wenzhou, and Changsha. Jinan was established in late April. According to the company's office survey, the total operating income of various companies throughout the year reached more than 1,922,800 yuan, of which Changsha had the most, reaching more than 460,000 yuan, followed by Wenzhou, with more than 380,000 yuan, and Zhenjiang, with more than 230,000 yuan. Although Xijing only operated for seven months, it also reached more than 140,000 yuan, which shows the people's love for national products in various places.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Social Demand <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to the Director Wang from the office told the reporter, the situation of promoting national products in various places is quite optimistic. However, the inland people are simple and honest, and their clothes are mostly cloth and fine silk crepe, accounting for more than 50% of the total sales. Other daily necessities are also mostly simple and unadorned. Therefore, it is necessary to deeply understand the social needs and select and match goods according to the local conditions, so it is quite popular with customers.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Planned Establishment <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Director Wang also mentioned that there are more than 50 companies planned to be established, but only one-fifth of them have been established. Therefore, we still need to continue our efforts. Currently, Kunming and Guangzhou are building buildings, and they should be established within the year. In the past, the establishment of companies in various places was in response to the proposals of local gentry and merchants, and the agreement was carried out. Now, the board of directors has decided that the office will consult with local people on the establishment according to the needs of various places, and plans to build companies in the nearby neighboring cities of the existing companies in order to promote them.</p>

<p>Last Year, Foreign Rice Imports Reached 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Large Warehouse in Jiujiang Has Been Implemented</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News met with Gu Shengyi, a leader in the food industry in this city. According to him, foreign rice imports last year reached a staggering 10 million yuan. Our country is established on agriculture, and yet this phenomenon exists. It is not only shocking, but also shameful. Since the Ministry of Finance established the Food Transportation and Sales Administration and implemented control over food transportation and sales, it has achieved great results. Foreign rice imports have gradually decreased. This can be proved by the fact that there were no records of foreign rice imports in January this year. The large warehouse established by the Ministry of Finance in Jiujiang has also been implemented. Furthermore, because the central government has the determination to rescue the rural areas, and the financial community has implemented many rural loans, the rural areas are expected to recover. Furthermore, with proper control over food transportation and sales, the problem of food self-sufficiency in our country is expected to be solved.</p>

<p>The Attendance at the Rural Economic Recovery Conference Is Completed</p>
<p>Guo Wen News reports that the Shanghai banking community, at the invitation of the Anhui Provincial Government, went to Wuhu to attend the Anhui Rural Economic Recovery Conference, including Shou Yicheng of the Central Bank, Zhang Xinyi of the Bank of China, Li Zhongchu of the Bank of Communications, Zou Bingwen of the Shanghai Bank, Yang Yinpu of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Wang Zhixin of the New China Bank, etc., have concluded their discussions in Anhui. Yesterday, some people, including Wang Zhixin and Yang Yinpu, had already returned to Shanghai. The rest are still in Nanjing, staying for a while, and may also return today. It is said that there were also about 30 banking representatives from Nanjing and other places attending the conference in Wuhu. The scope of discussion included the collection and distribution of rice and wheat produced in Anhui, transportation, and the establishment and investment of agricultural warehouses.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Strong Exports Tung Oil Urgently Needs Improvement <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Improve Production, Manufacturing, Transportation, and Sales to Establish International Reputation</p>
<p>Strive for Direct Trade to Consolidate Overseas Markets</p>
<p>This year, our country's tung oil exports are extremely strong, which is rare in recent years. This is indeed a somewhat optimistic phenomenon in our country's foreign trade. However, when considering the reasons for the sudden increase in exports, it is purely due to a temporary surge in foreign demand, rather than our country's tung oil having the ability to promote sales. If we want to maintain the permanent prosperity of tung oil exports, we still need to fundamentally improve the production and sales of tung oil. A reporter from Xin Xin News specially explored and recorded the reasons for the prosperity of tung oil exports and the areas that urgently need improvement, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Reasons for Prosperity <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>From January to September last year, our country's tung oil exports increased sharply. The total export volume for nine months was 576,987 hectoliters, an increase of 7.4% compared with the same period last year. The total export value was 29,938,098 yuan, an increase of 41% compared with the same period last year. The average price per hectoliter was 51.8 yuan, an increase of 12.5 yuan compared with 39.3 yuan in the same period last year. The prosperity of its exports is rare in recent years. The reasons for the increase in our country's tung oil exports and the increase in prices last year are as follows:</p>
<p>*   The United States is our country's largest sales market for tung oil. The average annual import reaches 120 million pounds. After the economic panic occurred, it was reduced to 70 to 80 million pounds. In recent years, due to the implementation of the economic recovery plan, it has been quite successful. Various industries are gradually recovering, and the demand for tung oil is gradually returning to normal. Therefore, our country's tung oil sales in the United States have also increased.</p>
<p>*   After the Italo-Abyssinian War broke out, Mediterranean traffic was often in danger of being blocked. European countries, in order to plan ahead, are actively preparing raw materials, and tung oil is one of the important raw materials, so the demand has increased even more.</p>
<p>*   Our country's tung oil production is scattered in the inland, and the transportation and sales of goods are quite troublesome. Once the demand increases sharply, the market inventory is exhausted, and it cannot be supplied continuously, so the price increases accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Should Be Improved <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the prosperity of our country's tung oil exports last year was mainly due to the sharp increase in overseas demand, and the increase in its price was due to the fact that our country's tung oil supply could not meet demand. Therefore, although our country's tung oil exports were very prosperous last year, this phenomenon is only the result of a temporary shortage of supply, and it does not mean that our country's tung oil has gained the ability to promote sales in overseas markets. It is difficult to regard it as a normal development. Therefore, if we want to maintain the permanent prosperity of tung oil exports, we still need to fundamentally improve the production and sales of tung oil. The most important points are the following five:</p>
<p>*   Our country's tung oil cultivation methods are not requested.</p>
<p>*   After the households purchase it, they store it at will, which is prone to rotting. The oil extraction method is also very outdated, so the quality is poor, the color is uneven, the impurities cannot be removed cleanly, the oil residue is too heavy, and the acidity is too high. Furthermore, because oil extraction is a handicraft industry, it is difficult to have a uniform quality.</p>
<p>*   Our country's oil extraction sticks to the old methods, so the oil extraction rate is extremely low. The amount of oil lost every year in the country is alarming.</p>
<p>*   The transportation and sales procedures are extremely complicated. Some merchants mix adulterated oil to make huge profits, which deteriorates the quality and affects foreign credit. Recently, the Commodity Inspection Bureaus of various ports have formulated合格qualified standards, but the standards set are lower than those in the United States. This should be gradually increased.</p>
<p>*   Poor loading and transportation methods, high freight rates, and frequent blockages often prevent timely delivery, so the market is at risk of being unable to meet demand.</p>
<p>*   Tung oil exports are purely controlled by foreign firms. There are no domestic organizations directly engaged in tung oil exports, and oil merchants cannot communicate, so the market price is purely manipulated by foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Consolidate the Market <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil is one of our country's special products and has a monopolistic nature in the international market. Although the United States is also engaged in tung planting, it is currently far from being self-sufficient. If we can seize the opportunity to improve and establish international credibility, the future will be very bright. The most important way to improve is in production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales. In terms of production, we should first concentrate our country's tung planting, with the government's help, to engage in large-scale planting. Such scientific methods can be cited, the variety can be uniform, the production volume can be calculated, and production can be increased. In terms of manufacturing, new methods should be actively adopted for oil extraction, so that the oil extraction rate can be increased. At the same time, we must pay attention to refining and grading the oil, and determine the standards for each grade. In terms of transportation, we should research economic loading and transportation methods, and transportation organizations should also find ways to reduce freight rates and implement responsible transportation to achieve economic and convenient purposes. As for trade, the fundamental plan is to concentrate exports. If domestic tung oil merchants can unite and form a large-scale export organization with a common force, our country's overseas tung oil market can be consolidated day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Ministry of Industry Orders Social Bureau to Improve Cooperative Organization <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Promulgation of a Concise Table of Registration Methods</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Industry states that the registration of cooperative societies and the detailed rules for the implementation of the Cooperative Society Law are clearly stipulated. The motive for establishing a cooperative, its objectives, the qualifications of its members, and the purity of its principles are all of great importance to the cooperative itself and its impact on society in general. It is difficult to expect progress without prior on-site investigation and careful review. In order to improve registration efficiency, the Ministry has formulated phased measures for provincial, municipal, and county bureaus to handle cooperative registration, along with a concise table, and has issued orders to the relevant provincial and municipal authorities to comply with. The Municipal Social Bureau has received this decision on registration methods, and the following is an excerpt: (A) County Government: If the number of villages with cooperatives in the county is less than one-tenth of the total number of villages in the county, or the number of cooperatives is less than thirty, it is not necessary to establish special personnel. When people apply to register a cooperative, if possible, entrust nearby cooperative promotion agencies or organizations to conduct an investigation and provide certification, and then submit it to the主管厅 for approval. If the number of villages with cooperatives in the county is more than one-tenth but less than three-tenths of the total number of villages in the county, or the number of cooperatives is less than eighty, one of the section chiefs may be designated to handle cooperative matters concurrently, or conduct the investigation themselves, or entrust nearby promotion agencies or organizations to conduct the investigation and provide certification, and then submit it to the主管厅 for approval. If the number of villages with cooperatives in the county is more than three-tenths but less than five-tenths of the total number of villages in the county, or the number of cooperatives is less than one hundred and fifty, one full-time person may be appointed, otherwise, the procedures are the same as in the previous paragraph. If the number of villages with cooperatives in the county is more than five-tenths of the total number of villages in the county, or the number of cooperatives exceeds one hundred and fifty, one to three full-time people may be appointed to directly handle the reporting. (B) 主管厅: If the number of counties with cooperatives in the province is less than one-fifth of the total number of counties in the province, it may be necessary to submit a report to the Ministry of Industry for approval. If the number of counties with cooperatives in the province is more than one-fifth but less than one-half of the total number of counties in the province, or the number of cooperatives is less than five hundred, one to two full-time people may be appointed. If the number of counties with cooperatives in the province is more than one-half but less than three-quarters of the total number of counties in the province, or the number of cooperatives is less than one thousand, two to three full-time people may be appointed. If the number of counties with cooperatives in the province is more than three-quarters of the total number of counties, or the number of cooperatives exceeds one thousand, the number of managerial personnel may be increased to five. (C) Municipal Government and Social Bureau: If the number of cooperatives established in the urban area is less than fifty, it may be handled in accordance with paragraph two of section A. The municipal government (city affiliated with the provincial government) shall consult with the主管厅 for approval, and the Social Bureau shall handle it early. If the number of cooperatives established in the urban area is more than fifty but less than one hundred, it may be handled in accordance with paragraph three of section A, otherwise, the procedures are the same as in the previous paragraph. If the number of cooperatives established in the urban area is more than one hundred, paragraph four of section A shall apply.</p>

<p>And Requests that Cruisers be Staffed by Chinese Nationals</p>
<p>Foreign sailors on the Jianghai Customs Yunxing cruiser allegedly killed people under the pretext of inspecting smuggled goods in the Dinghai waters, arousing public outrage among Chinese sailors. The local sailors' party branch and the Marine Engineering Association have petitioned the central government to severely punish the foreign criminals. The Marine Engineering Association's petition is as follows: "We petition that foreign sailors on Jianghai Customs cruisers are wantonly killing innocent people and treating human life as a game. We request that they be brought to justice immediately and that all ships be staffed by Chinese nationals to prevent future incidents and uphold the sanctity of human life. We have learned that for the newly built cruisers of the Jianghai Customs, this association has previously petitioned that all crew members should be Chinese nationals. At the same time, we sent a letter to the Inspector General of Customs requesting that five ships be allocated first to be commanded by Chinese personnel. The intention of this association is none other than to recognize that foreign personnel, after all, are not of our race. Their actions are often unreasonable and deliberately contemptuous. Countless precedents in the past testify to this. Moreover, the Customs is a Chinese institution, and cruisers are Chinese ships. Their entry and exit from coastal ports are not comparable to commercial vessels, and they often involve national defense. In recent years, the skills and talents of Chinese marine engineering and navigation have emerged in large numbers, and in fact, there is no need to rely on foreign talent. The Inspector General of Customs' partiality towards foreign personnel and rejection of Chinese personnel have led to the seizure of sailors' positions and an increase in the number of unemployed people. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. We believe that the ministry in charge of customs affairs should resolutely change to employing Chinese nationals for these foreign sailors who obstruct navigation, harm territorial waters, are unsuitable for the people, and waste national funds. This would not only benefit national defense but also be the hope of the entire nation. This association submitted a petition to the ministry on December 13th of last year, requesting its prompt implementation. It has been more than a month since then, and no approval has been received. Recently, we received a report that on January 13th, three foreign sailors on the Jianghai Customs Yunxing cruiser committed the crime of intentional homicide in the Zhushan Yan waters of Dinghai. The detailed facts have been published in a Shanghai newspaper on the 16th and a Ningbo newspaper on the 14th (original report attached). Thinking that the responsibility of customs cruisers is to investigate smuggling, and the natural duty of sailors is to manage the machinery, even if there is tax evasion and resistance to inspection, cruisers should aim to stop the smuggling. Even if there is resistance, bloodshed should be avoided. How can they fire bullets indiscriminately and affect the innocent? Furthermore, Liu Renyong's fishing boat had already obeyed the ship's orders, and the boatman Lou Ahe had already reached the ship's deck and was lowering the sails and dropping anchor, stopping the boat for inspection. Yet, the three Westerners still opened fire on the non-resisting people. It is clear that in their minds, they have no regard for our country or our people. Their lawlessness has reached its extreme. The result of the search was that there was no smuggling. The Westerners also knew that they had caused a major disaster. They still carried Lou Ahe, who was riddled with bullets and on the verge of death, to the Huamei Hospital in Ningbo. Disregarding the life and death of the injured person, they immediately boarded the ship and fled to Shanghai, causing Lou Ahe to die shortly after. The intentional homicide by the three Westerners is undeniable. We believe that in a republican country, the people are the main body. During the period of political tutelage, human life is the most important. Even if they were considered to be smuggling and resisting with bare hands, at most, the Westerners could only arrest the people and the boat, and our judicial organs would handle it. Moreover, Lou Ahe was a good boatman and a law-abiding citizen. Can foreign sailors freely kill people? Or is this a special right granted by the Inspector General of Customs? It is truly shocking and appalling. Those who kill should be put to death. This is a clear teaching from ancient times. Since they are employed by our country, our laws should apply to them. This association also refers to Article 26 of Chapter 2 of the new constitution announced by our country, which states, 'Any civil servant who violates the law and infringes upon the freedom or rights of the people shall be subject to criminal and civil liability in addition to disciplinary action according to law. The injured people shall also be entitled to claim compensation from the state for the damages suffered according to law.' The glorious constitution is for all people to see. Therefore, the three Westerners abused their power and killed the people, committing the crime under Article 276 of Chapter 22 of our new criminal law. We request that the ministry immediately arrest the three Westerners and send them to the court for severe punishment according to law. At the same time, all foreign sailors on the Customs cruisers should be replaced by Chinese nationals to eliminate the root of the disaster. This association is willing to be responsible for introducing marine engineering and navigation personnel with excellent skills and experience to take over the duties. This would protect the sovereignty of the coast and reduce the nation's expenditures. If we continue to condone this, or if the Inspector General of Customs intends to favor them, then the will of the nation will be a mere formality, and the lives of the people will be like weeds. We, the descendants of the gods and Chinese, will become the shooting targets of blue-eyed, yellow-bearded people. From then on, Chinese people can be slaughtered at will, and they can be trampled on everywhere. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We believe that liberating the nation is the earnest legacy of our party's late leader. How can our people be arbitrarily killed by foreigners? We beseech your ministry to take swift action, arrest the criminals, punish them according to law, and immediately replace the foreign sailors with Chinese nationals. We will wait for your urgent orders. We respectfully submit this to the Minister of Finance Kong."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Shanghai County General Household Registration Re-check, Handling Methods for Household Changes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Since Shanghai County was ordered to conduct a general household registration re-check, which began on the 30th of last month, work is currently being intensified. Yesterday, the county government formulated guidelines for the general household registration re-check and ordered the districts to implement them. Among them, when re-checking household registration, the head of the household should first be asked for their name, the total number of people in the household, and the number of males and females, and these should be checked against the household registration survey form to see if they match. If the head of household has changed or the number of people in the household does not match what is stated on the household registration survey form, the following measures should be taken: If there is no change in the household and the head of household has died, a new head of household should be appointed, and the household registration survey form, joint guarantee, and house number plate should be corrected accordingly. If the entire household moves out and another new household moves in, the original survey form should be canceled and a new survey form should be filled out and a new number issued, treating the 列 number as one of the original household numbers. If the entire household moves out and no new household moves in, in addition to canceling the household registration survey form, the house number plate should be marked with the words "vacant household." If there is no change in the household but there is a change in the number of people, the original household registration survey form should be added to or canceled as appropriate: (A) If it is a birth, the date of birth should be added, and the household should be urged to correct the number of people on the house number plate at the same time. (B) If it is a death, the name of the deceased should be crossed out on the survey form and "death" should be noted in the remarks column, and the number of people on the house number plate should be corrected. (C) If someone moves in, the name, gender, age, origin, education level, occupation of the person moving in, and their relationship to the head of household should be added, and the reason for moving in and the date of moving in should be noted in the remarks column, and the number of people on the house number plate should be corrected at the same time. (D) If someone moves out, the name of the person moving out should be crossed out and "moved out" should be noted in the remarks column, and the number of days on the house number plate should be corrected. If there are more than five households with changes in each 甲, a new joint guarantee should be replaced.</p>

<p>Since the Shengsi Islands were placed under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province, the people of Jiangsu have strongly opposed it. Representatives were sent to petition the central and provincial governments. The fishery associations of thirty-one counties, including Nantong, and academic groups in the aquatic industry have also sent telegrams to strongly object. Jiangsu gentry Han Guojun and others have also risen to respond. The original telegram is excerpted as follows: Nanjing, sent to Chairman Hu of the Central Party Department, Chairman Wang of the Political Committee, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Jiang of the Interior, Minister Wu of Industry, Jian. The Shengsi Islands outside the mouth of the Yangtze River are the barrier of the Jin, Feng, Chuan, and Nan counties. During the late Qing Dynasty, they were the garrison land of Suzhou, and a general was stationed in Chongming, so the land belonged to the jurisdiction of Chong. Recently, Jiangsu Province has emphasized county and district administration, and Shengsi is the fifth district of Chongming, which is being planned. The fishing industry is relying on maintenance, but suddenly there is news that it will be placed under the rule of Zhejiang. Guojun and others dare not agree and request that the old system be maintained and no changes be made. Han Guojun, Chen Taoyi, Zhang Zhongren, Leng, Tang Wenzhi, Wang Qingmu, Lu Hao, Shi Kou.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Military and Political Department Transportation Corps Holds Coal Gas Vehicle Test <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>中华公司中華公司 (Zhonghua Company) Achieves Best Results</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Military and Political Department Transportation Corps has completed the coal gas vehicle test. The comparison standards are divided into three items: work efficiency, usage method, and the degree of cleanliness of the coal gas. The participants in the test were 中华煤气车公司 (Zhonghua Coal Gas Vehicle Company), 中国煤气机厂 (China Coal Gas Engine Factory), and 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop). The vehicle tested by 中华公司 (Zhonghua Company) was a General Motors truck with 76 horsepower and a load capacity of 3 tons. The vehicle tested by 中国厂 (China Factory) was a Lihe Fearless passenger car with 75 horsepower and a load capacity of 1.5 tons. The vehicle tested by 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop) was a Chevrolet truck with 70 horsepower and a load capacity of 1.5 tons. The test period was from January 13th to 21st. The test route was from Nanjing, via Shanghai and Hangzhou, and back to Nanjing, a total of 860 kilometers. The main testers were German advisor Roman, technician Shen Yunshan, Peng Hao, Hu Zongpu, and technician Wang Changcheng, among others. Detailed records were kept of the various aspects of the test. On the 13th, the vehicles gathered in Nanjing to inspect the structure of the vehicles and the coal gas stoves, and to load the vehicles with the specified amount. On the 14th, they departed from Nanjing for Shanghai. There was heavy snow that day. As a result, only one vehicle from 中华公司 (Zhonghua Company) was able to reach Shanghai. The vehicles from 中国厂 (China Factory) and 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop) experienced obstacles along the way, and switched to using gasoline to travel. They arrived in Shanghai only on the afternoon of the 15th. On the 16th, the two vehicles from 中国厂 (China Factory) and 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop) returned to their factories for repairs. The vehicle from 中华公司 (Zhonghua Company) was parked at the Xihu Company gas station at the designated location. On the morning of the 17th, they departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou. Each vehicle departed every ten minutes. The order of departure was determined by drawing lots. Also, because the Minhang ferry took time, the arrival times in Hangzhou varied. On the 18th, they drove from Hangzhou to Huzhou. That night, the vehicle from 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop) was repaired for several hours. On the 19th, they drove from Huzhou to Nanjing again. The performance of each vehicle was better, and no obstacles occurred along the way. On the 20th, the engines were disassembled in Nanjing to check the cleanliness of the coal gas. The vehicle from 中华公司 (Zhonghua Company) was the best, with no ash or dirt in the cylinder, which was no different from using gasoline. The vehicle from 中国厂 (China Factory) was second, and the vehicle from 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop) was the worst. On the 21st, the vehicles would be driven to Tangshan again for a final test ride by senior officials. The vehicle from 仲明工场 (Zhongming Workshop) did not participate due to an accident. The calculation method for work efficiency was to divide the weight carried by the distance traveled by the time spent and the horsepower of the vehicle. The vehicle from 中华公司 (Zhonghua Company) carried twice the weight of the other two vehicles, and the total time spent driving was also shorter because no obstacles occurred along the way. As a result, the vehicle from 中华公司 (Zhonghua Company) was better than the other two. All parties were satisfied and believed that the charcoal vehicle, after this heavy-duty long-distance test, could prove to be practical and beneficial to both national defense and the economy. It was decided to adopt it in large quantities.</p>

<p>A Gambler Wounded in the Left Leg by a Bullet</p>
<p>The Proprietor and Shooter Both Fled</p>
<p>In Wu Family Lane, located at the intersection of the Shanghai Municipal and Minhang County border on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe long-distance bus route, Zhao Bingnian, a former Public Security Bureau police officer who had been dismissed, was operating a teahouse. Adjacent to it was the temporary office of the Caojing District Defense Corps, but no corps members were stationed there. Zhao took advantage of this opportunity during the recent Lunar New Year to gather people for gambling and skimming profits. This was discovered by the Caojing District Police Station, which dispatched officers around 10 PM last night to apprehend the gamblers. The gamblers, upon suddenly seeing the police, scrambled to escape, causing great disorder. Amidst the chaos, a gunshot suddenly rang out, and a bullet struck Wu Adi (also known as A Xiaonian, 28 years old, residing in Wu Family Lane), wounding his left leg and causing him to fall to the ground. Upon hearing the gunshot, the police immediately prepared for action and began searching for the shooter, but he had already taken the opportunity to flee. The proprietor, Zhao Bingnian, also escaped during the confusion. The police took six individuals, including a Mr. Li, who were present at the gambling den, along with the gambling paraphernalia, to the station for interrogation. The wounded Wu Adi was transported overnight by car to a Shanghai hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was to the leg, and the bullet was extracted yesterday. After applying medication and bandaging, he was discharged and returned home. Currently, the police station is conducting a rigorous investigation to apprehend the shooter and Zhao Bingnian, the operator of the teahouse, to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Case of a Young Woman Stabbed to Death: Discovery of the Murderer's Suicide Note <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Note Stated the Deceased Was a 17-Year-Old Cigarette Factory Worker</p>
<p>Jealousy Over Her Relationship With Another Man Led the Murderer to Lure Her to a Hotel and Kill Her</p>
<p>In room 54 (reported as 45 in yesterday's news) of the Anshang Hotel on Balizhao Street in the French Concession, a female guest was fatally stabbed by a man who had accompanied her. The murderer fled. The incident was discovered by a waiter, Chen Jinyu, who informed the accountant, who reported it to the French police. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the scene to investigate, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for examination. It was reported yesterday that the case would be reported to the Second Special District Court today for further examination and that the deceased's belongings and clothing were taken back to the police station to investigate the murderer. It is now learned that the murderer left behind a letter, which was taken back to the police station by the officers. The letter reportedly stated that the deceased's name was Zhang Fuying, 17 years old, and that she worked in a cigarette factory. The murderer had been in a romantic relationship with her since she was 14. When she was 16, she became involved with another man. The former boyfriend (the murderer now at large) then paid 5,000 yuan to have her break off the relationship with the latter. However, the deceased continued to have a secret affair with the latter, leading the murderer to resent her. He devised a plan to lure her to a hotel and kill her to vent his anger. The detailed course of events will be reported in detail three days later. When the police sent officers to the mortuary yesterday to take photos of the body, they discovered knife wounds on both palms and fingers, suggesting that the deceased was not killed while asleep but was conscious and resisted, resulting in the injuries to her hands. The French police sent Detective Bu Zhenglong to investigate in the Gaochang Temple area of Nanshi yesterday. There were no cigarette factories there except for Qichang Cigar Factory. The police then summoned Wang Maye, an employee of the cigarette factory, as well as the pimps and brothel keepers in the French Concession to the mortuary to identify the body. They all stated that they did not recognize the deceased. No one else came to identify the body.</p>

<p>Each Robber Pushes Responsibility onto Others</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals Involvement in Other Cases</p>
<p>Xiang Yixin, a Ningbo native and owner of Xingchang Iron Factory at No. 151 Oujia Road, was kidnapped in the Jiamao Temple on Gonghe Road, Zhabei, last autumn, but escaped unharmed. Thugs, however, coveted his wealth, and between October 13th and January 6th of this year, sent more than ten threatening letters demanding 80,000 yuan. After investigation by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Detective Liu Shaokui, Detective Qian Xianting, and Chen Yonggui of the General Inspection Office, eight suspects, including Wei Youliang, Wang Wencheng, and Xiang's son-in-law Xu Ruixiang, were arrested and detained in the Jiaxing Road and Hongkou police stations, and then transferred to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the mastermind behind the threatening letters was Xu Ruixiang. The defendant Wei Youliang wrote two letters, reducing the demand from 80,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan. Wang Wencheng wrote three letters, initially demanding 10,000 yuan, based on Xu's draft, with a promise of a 20% reward of 2,000 yuan after receipt. Wang later wrote another letter intending to obtain 5,000 yuan for himself. The last letter was written by Xu in pencil. The suspects confessed in the police station and should be severely punished according to the law. Furthermore, Gong A'gen committed a robbery on Nanjing Road on December 7th last year, stealing 60 yuan from a Mr. Cao at No. 541. The letters were presented for inspection. Xiang Yixin stated that Xu Ruixiang was indeed his son-in-law, but his daughter passed away nine years ago, leaving a granddaughter. Xu had borrowed a total of more than 4,000 yuan from him. After his kidnapping last autumn, he asked Xu to work in the factory with a monthly salary of 16 yuan. After receiving the threatening letters, Xu was the one who went to negotiate several times. Wei Youliang confessed that Wang Jinzhang brought the drafts of the threatening letters and that he wrote two of them. Wang Jinzhang and Zhang Guan'gen claimed that Gong A'gen was the source of the drafts, and they did not know anything else. Gong A'gen confessed that Xue Shandong, who is at large, brought the drafts, mentioning that Xiang's son-in-law Xu was an informant. He only received six yuan after the Nanjing Road robbery. Wang Wencheng confessed that Xu wrote the drafts of the threatening letters and asked him to copy them. Liu Shanshu and Yang Fuchen testified that they knew Xu had asked Wang Wencheng to write the threatening letters at Wang's residence, but they did not participate. Lawyer Yan Fangang defended Xu Ruixiang, whose testimony was evasive and adamant in denying the charges. Judge Xiao instructed that all be remanded in custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>

<p>Chen Hongfu, a Chongming native residing in Yanjiacuo, Gaoqiao, Pudong, who made a living by farming, was attacked late in the evening of November 27th of last year, resulting in two broken ribs and immediate death. His body was abandoned on the roadside, making it a suspicious case. The next day, the local security chief reported the incident to the local court, which dispatched Prosecutor Li Fen to the scene for examination. The prosecutor noted that the deceased's wife, Chen Huangshi, did not seek justice for her husband's wrongful death and seemed indifferent and without grief, which raised suspicion. After the local police station summoned her for questioning, she claimed that her husband had been caught stealing taro from someone else's field and was beaten to death. To ascertain the truth, the police sent officers to her home to investigate and found half a sack of taro. After a thorough investigation, it became clear that her statement was false and that the taro belonged to the deceased. Suspicion of other circumstances arose, and Chen Huangshi was detained and sent to court for questioning. Since the tragic incident, there has been much speculation in the area, with some claiming that the deceased was secretly murdered by his wife, Chen Huangshi, and her maternal uncle, Lu Zhiliang, and others due to a rent debt Chen owed Lu. Lu Zhiliang was subsequently arrested and detained for questioning. The judge, considering the seriousness of the case, instructed the warden of the detention center to suspend visits for both Lu Zhiliang and Chen Huangshi to prevent collusion. Meanwhile, key witnesses, such as Zhang Qinglang and Yang the Blind, were summoned and questioned repeatedly. It has now been learned that Prosecutor Li Fen has spared no effort to investigate the case in detail, personally conducting on-site investigations and repeatedly summoning the deceased's children and witnesses to the court for detailed questioning. He filed a public prosecution on the preceding day and the public trial should take place soon.</p>
<h3 id="e148">National Association of Western Medicine Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Presenting Three Major Reasons to Advocate for Physicians Nationwide</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Western Medicine Association, in accordance with the resolutions of the Third National Representative Congress, appealed to all senior central government agencies to grant medical licenses to all practicing physicians so that they can serve society with peace of mind. In addition to representatives from provinces, cities, and counties gathering at the Central Hotel in Beijing, the association's representatives, including Qian Longzhang, Nong Shisong, Liu Renfu, Zhu Bin, Hong Xichun, Zhang Guowei, Liu Xinbai, Wu Jingcun, and Secretary Qiu Pingsan, traveled to Beijing by overnight train last night with a petition and letters to important figures. The original text is as follows: The petition states that, given the vast territory of our country and the negligence of inland administration, the number of Western-trained physicians is insufficient to meet the needs of the entire country. Therefore, we request that those who have been practicing Western medicine for the past eighteen years be granted licenses to practice medicine, and that those who have been practicing medicine since then be provided with relief and that flexible measures be re-issued to meet the needs of society. It has been noted that, since the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Physicians by the Ministry of Health in 1929, it has been difficult to implement due to its incompatibility with the immature state of medicine in our country. Subsequently, in 1932, the Executive Yuan passed two directives on flexible licensing of physicians, issued by the Ministry of Interior. These directives stated that "Our country has a vast territory and too few qualified physicians. Many have graduated from unapproved medical schools or have come from hospitals, and many of them have rich experience and are valuable talents. If we do not find a way out for them and order them to stop practicing, those with actual medical abilities will inevitably suffer injustice. At a time when there is a shortage of physicians, how can we meet the needs of society? It is the duty of the Ministry to consider the needs of the people and seek practical solutions, so we have formulated two flexible licensing methods" (omitted). At the time, administrative offices in various places, except for major trading ports, mostly treated the directives as mere formalities, not essential, and shelved them, failing to report or publicize them, causing Western-trained physicians in the interior who met the flexible qualifications to miss the statutory opportunity. This was even more true in remote provinces and counties where the atmosphere was closed. Now, county governments are using the regulations to crack down and force physicians to stop practicing. The original intent of a country's government and its decrees is to promote benefits and eliminate harms. Since the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Physicians, benefits have not been seen, but harms have proliferated. To adopt the decrees of other countries that have undergone repeated reforms and implement them in our country with immature medicine is like forcing people to cut their feet to fit their shoes. Before the shoes fit, the feet are already injured. Everyone knows this is impossible. Moreover, each country has its own national conditions. Looking back to the past and examining the abuses, this is the first reason why we should request the re-issuance of secondary flexible licensing methods for physicians to eliminate abuses. Moreover, the current number of Western-trained physicians in our country is truly insufficient to meet the needs of the entire country. Whenever epidemics and diseases break out in the interior, the public relies entirely on this small number of Western-trained physicians to administer injections and provide emergency care. They are truly as rare as phoenix feathers and as compassionate as Buddha. Furthermore, the central national defense design agencies are actively designing and concentrating technical talents to respond to the changing circumstances. If the local county governments are allowed to force them to stop practicing, it would cause those with real talents and experience to be buried and suffer injustice. It does not conform to the national policy of caring for the needs of the people and seeking practical solutions. This is the second reason why we should request the re-issuance of flexible methods and provide relief to already practicing physicians, supplement registration, protect national talent, and meet the needs of the people. It has been reported that the State Council has promulgated the Regulations for Traditional Chinese Medicine, which state that "Article 1: Before the Examination Yuan holds examinations for traditional Chinese medicine, anyone who is at least 25 years old and has one of the following qualifications may practice traditional Chinese medicine after being examined and certified by the Ministry of Interior: Those who have passed the examination or assessment for traditional Chinese medicine by the central or provincial governments and have a certificate; Those who have been issued a license to practice medicine by the central or provincial governments; Those who have graduated from a traditional Chinese medicine school and have a certificate; Those who have been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for more than five years." All have the possibility of being granted a license. Compared to the Regulations for Western Medicine: Those who have graduated from a national or government-approved public or private medical school for more than five years and have a diploma; Those who have graduated from a government-approved private medical school in a foreign country for more than five years and have a diploma, or those who have a physician's license from a foreign government; Foreigners who have a physician's license from their respective governments and have a certificate from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Those who have passed the physician's examination and have a certificate, there is a vast difference. Western-trained physicians, who are also citizens and serve under the banner of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, are treated so differently. What could be more unfair? Moreover, in the late Qing Dynasty, our country had no medical school facilities, let alone approved or unapproved ones. Even in the recent reform of the political system, the number of medical schools run by the state is few and far between. Furthermore, the regulations were promulgated eighteen years ago, and graduation requires more than five years. It is inevitable that the standards are too high. To strive to align our medical administration with that of European and American countries in one fell swoop is to be impatient and not to seek practical solutions. This is the third reason why we should request the re-issuance of secondary flexible licensing for physicians to maintain their profession. In this transitional era, Western-trained physicians who are needed by society should be supported and nurtured, treated equally, and the innocent should be protected. Those who have been practicing medicine for more than 18 years should all be granted licenses, and those who have been practicing medicine since then should also be provided with relief. To save the people is to save the country (and those who have been practicing medicine for the past eighteen years have six years of experience, which is more than the five-year limit for granting licenses to traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. It cannot be said to be excessive in terms of both reason and sentiment). This association, in accordance with the suggestions and resolutions passed by the delegates from all provinces, cities, and counties at the Third National Western Medicine Representative Congress on New Year's Day, and the petition filed by the representatives, respectfully petitions the government to consider the needs of the people, graciously approve the issuance of medical licenses, so that everyone can serve society with peace of mind, so that it will be fair, practical, and beneficial to the public and private sectors. Respectfully presented to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Health. The Executive Committee of the Chinese Western Medicine Association and the delegates of the Third National Congress respectfully kowtow. Chairman Qian Longzhang, February 2, 1936.</p>

<p>The Chinese Medical College on Route Tenant, to stimulate academic research among colleagues and showcase the respect shown to Chinese medicine in Japan, has collected 500-600 kinds of Chinese medical books published in the East and held a flourishing exhibition of Chinese medicine. Guests were invited to visit. Yesterday was the second day, and the number of visitors increased. In addition to representatives from medical and pharmaceutical groups from this city and other ports, as well as celebrities from all walks of life, more than ten Japanese pharmacists, including Nakamura Shunsuke, came together, inscribed words of praise, and accumulated a case full of drafts. Yesterday, a large number of books purchased by the college from Japan arrived in time, so the display became even richer. In total, more than a thousand guests visited throughout the day. Qianqingtang and the Chinese Medicine Bookstore set up temporary book sales points on the premises and sold several hundred yuan worth of books, which shows the increasing interest in reading about Chinese medicine. Today is the last day, and the exhibition will be closed tomorrow and put into the library collection. Non-students of the college will lose the opportunity to read it. All those who love Chinese medicine can go and see it.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The New Drug Association Requests That the Enforcement of Registered Patent Medicines Be Delayed Until the Deadline <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The National New Drug Industry Association submitted a report to the Ministry of Health yesterday, stating that the deadline for patent medicine registration by its member associations was the end of last year. However, the number of patent medicine types is extremely large, and very few members have received licenses. The main reason for this is that the procedures for revising prescriptions and amending instructions are quite complicated and cannot be completed in time. Therefore, on November 27 last year, the association submitted a report to your ministry, expressing its difficulties and requesting that the deadline be extended. Your ministry graciously considered the situation and issued Medical Document No. 2185 on December 7 last year, extending the deadline by six months and reporting to the Executive Yuan for record. In accordance with this, the association has forwarded the approved documents to inform drug merchants in various places. However, drug merchants in various places have recently reported that military and police authorities in various places, not understanding the people's livelihood, are still rashly enforcing bans based on the Regulations for the Management of Patent Medicines during this extended registration period, which is having a significant impact on business. Therefore, they request that the association submit another report to your ministry, asking you to consider the situation and promptly issue a notice to the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties, instructing them not to enforce bans rashly before the deadline for patent medicine registration, in order to maintain business.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Liu Zhongying, Executive Committee Member of the Ratepayers' Association, Suggests Changing Rickshaw Pullers' Armbands to Numbered Uniforms <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>More Attractive and More Practical</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession started registering rickshaw pullers last year. Registered rickshaw pullers must pay a fee of one yuan, and the Municipal Council will give the rickshaw puller a magnetic armband for identification. Anyone who has not registered and obtained this armband is not allowed to work. Now, Mr. Liu Zhongying, an executive committee member of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Concession, believes that armbands are easily lost. He specially suggested that the Ratepayers' Association ask the Municipal Council to change this registration fee to make rickshaw pullers' numbered uniforms, which would be distributed to each rickshaw puller to wear while working, in order to show consideration for laborers and further enhance the appearance of the city. The original letter from Mr. Liu to the Ratepayers' Association is recorded below: "Sir, I would like to inform you that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession stipulates that, starting last year, all rickshaw pullers operating in the Concession must first register, pay a registration fee of one yuan, and obtain an armband before they can perform labor. Since the implementation, the inspection has been extremely strict, resulting in many rickshaw pullers who are unable to pay the registration fee losing their jobs. At the same time, because the registration fee is too high, rickshaw pullers in general feel overwhelmed. Moreover, the armbands that are received are easily lost due to their small size. In order to show consideration for laborers, I propose that the Municipal Council change the registration fee to make rickshaw pullers' numbered uniforms, which would be distributed to each rickshaw puller to wear while working, in place of armbands. This measure would not only enhance the appearance of the city, but also provide rickshaw pullers with practical benefits by adding a piece of clothing. Furthermore, it would not contradict the Municipal Council's policy of rectifying rickshaw affairs. Therefore, I am sending this special letter to suggest this, hoping that you will consider it."</p>

<p>The Dayun Hotel, newly opened at the intersection of Avenue Baille and Route Wantz, Grand Concourse, French Concession, was founded by Shao Heyuan, a celebrity from the sea. The three-story building has been completed, with beautiful interior decoration and simple furnishings. The prices are economical, ranging from 50 cents to 2 yuan. Mr. Shao is engaged in industry and has a wide circle of friends. This undertaking is intended to entertain guests from other ports and to be a gathering place for industrial talents, not comparable to ordinary businesses that profit from the hotel industry. Since the first transactions were made on the ancient New Year's Day, travelers have considered the name "Dayun" (Great Luck) to be auspicious, resulting in a very enthusiastic response to room reservations, with daily announcements of full occupancy. It is now heard that the official opening is scheduled for February 12 of the Gregorian calendar. At that time, major manufacturers will donate a large number of samples, hundreds of kinds, to be distributed to travelers as souvenirs.</p>

<p>The Municipal National Goods Year Movement Association sent a letter to the women's and academic circles of the city, requesting them to vigorously promote national goods. The original text reads: "Sir, our country has been promoting national goods for many years, but as a result, the import of foreign goods is still surprisingly high. This proves that national goods are not yet popular. For this reason, our association has designated this year as the Municipal National Goods Year. The purpose is to require all citizens, regardless of their background, to lead by example and vigorously promote national goods. We have found that women's and academic circles have also devoted themselves to the promotion of national goods in the past. Therefore, we are sending this special letter, hoping that you will continue your past spirit, so that the future of national goods will see a glimmer of hope, the import of foreign goods will be sharply reduced from now on, and the country will be strong and the market will be revitalized. This is what we rely on."</p>

<p>Cai Jingjun, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, believes that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, so he pays great attention to traffic in the area. For example, red and green traffic lights to direct vehicle traffic have been installed in the Nanshi Old West Gate, Small West Gate, and Zhabei Baoshan Road and other places. It is now learned that Director Cai, in view of the fact that there are a large number of vehicles entering and leaving the intersections of Nanyang Bridge, Xinqiao Street, Old North Gate, Xinbeimen, and Xinkaihe, which are adjacent to the concessions, and that the red and green traffic lights to direct vehicle traffic are still lacking, believes that this not only hinders traffic, but also concerns the international outlook. Therefore, he will order the Director of the Traffic Section of the Second Division of the Bureau to prepare all plans and submit them to the Municipal Government for approval, so that they can continue to be installed.</p>

<p>Song poetry is a must-read for scholars of Chinese language, so many publishers have printed it. However, the prices are surprisingly high, and the sentences are not punctuated, which is inconvenient for beginners. Even those who study poetry must rely on poetry rules and other references. The Shanghai Magazine Company has decided to publish rare and important books of Chinese literature. It has specially invited Shi Cunshi to punctuate and carefully proofread them, and they are printed according to the Jigu Ge edition. They are divided into six collections and sold in separate volumes. The price is low, and the printing is elegant and lovely. After the first collection was published, it was reprinted in less than a month. It has also been recommended by Mu Xun, a contemporary expert in poetry, and is very popular among readers. The second collection has now been released, with individual volumes sold at 50-70 cents for the first collection and 40-55 cents for the second collection. There is a 10% discount for in-store purchases, and postage is free for out-of-town purchases. It is heard that the company is responding to the requests of more than a thousand readers in the interior and will issue a pre-order for one month. Those who pay the full pre-order price of 17 yuan can still order, and those who need postage will be charged an additional 1.5 yuan. The deadline is the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e177">A Tour of the National Children's Reading Material Exhibition: Courteous and Kind Reception, Children Reluctant to Put Down Books and Linger <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing Correspondence) As the National Children's Year begins, and compulsory education is being implemented, children's education is gradually gaining attention. The National Children's Reading Material Exhibition, sponsored by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee of the Ministry of Education, concluded yesterday (the 30th) at the Daxing Palace Elementary School. Our reporter made a special trip to visit it and records the following miscellaneous notes:</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>At the entrance of the venue, there is a "National Children's Year Sign," shaped like an inverted L, with the words in red artistic font, attracting the attention of passersby. After entering, one proceeds along the designated route. At the entrance, the eight large characters "Vigorously Implement Child-Centered Education" are written. Then, one arrives at the signing area to sign in. Here, visitor instructions and a list of exhibited book categories are displayed. Afterward, one enters the first exhibition room, which features supplementary reading materials, divided into categories such as Nature, Society, Literature, Series, and Periodicals. Part of it is children's supplementary reading material compiled and printed by local elementary schools themselves. Another part is children's publications from Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, The World Book Company, Datong Book Company, and publications for the Children's Year. This type of book is particularly abundant, displayed in a total of three rooms. According to the visitor rules, visitors can freely pick up and read the books. Therefore, at this time, there are many children, mostly eleven or twelve years old, some only eight or nine years old, flipping through them non-stop. Some are quietly reciting, revealing a spirit of self-motivated learning. It turns out that schools are currently on winter vacation. The exhibition had designated February 1st and the 3rd and 4th as visiting days for students, but these elementary school students are taking advantage of the holiday to visit early, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>In the second exhibition room, a large silk banner with black characters on a red background hangs, the original text being "Girls and boys must receive education equally." On the surrounding walls, many wooden signs are also hung, with many cautionary statements written on them, transcribed as follows: (1) Children's books are a treasure trove of children's knowledge; (2) Parents should choose and purchase excellent reading materials for their children; (3) Elementary schools should provide more reading materials for children to read; (4) Children should save their candy money to buy reading materials; (5) The habit of reading should be cultivated from a young age; (6) The most important conditions for choosing reading materials are that they are interesting, meaningful, and suitable for their level.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The exhibition rooms were originally classrooms of the Daxing Palace Elementary School, so the capacity is not very large. When the reporter entered the third exhibition room, it was almost overcrowded. The reporter immediately took a count, finding a total of forty-two people, including eighteen adults and twenty-four children, with more children than adults. This is probably a rare phenomenon in any exhibition. What is particularly worth mentioning is that most of the adult visitors were just taking a quick look and rarely browsing carefully, while the children, on the other hand, were reluctant to put down the books and seemed to linger indefinitely. The reporter lingered in this room for about ten minutes, and only three or five children left, while the adults had already changed to another group. This clearly demonstrates how interested children are in the exhibition.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>In each exhibition room, the reception duties are all handled by children, which is precisely giving them an opportunity to show their work. At this time, an adult visitor was eating melon seeds when a female receptionist, about thirteen or fourteen years old, noticed and walked up to him, saying kindly, "Please don't eat anything in the exhibition hall." The person certainly accepted, but the reporter felt ashamed for the general adult population, because this is an embarrassing thing for adults in front of children.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The fourth exhibition room features textbooks, divided into subjects such as Chinese, Music, Hygiene, General Knowledge, Art, and Handicraft. On the wall hangs a red silk banner with "New Children Create New China," which is very bright and eye-catching. Here are displayed many elementary school textbooks that are no longer in use. The reporter casually reviewed a few volumes. One is a higher elementary school moral cultivation textbook, published by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Ministry of Education in December of the second year of the Xuantong era, compiled by Chen Xugong and others. Another is a single-grade elementary school moral cultivation teaching material, published by the China Book Company in April of the second year of the Xuantong era, compiled by Jin ..., Gu Zhuo, Gu Zuji, and others. Because of the reporter's age, I had never read these two books, so seeing this type of book, I felt particularly interested. It is estimated that those who read textbooks from this period should be at least thirty-five years old.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth exhibition rooms contain reference books. Part of them are children's books from various countries around the world, collected by the committee submitting a request to the Ministry of Education to forward to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing embassies abroad to collect them from the educational institutions of the countries where they are stationed. There are about ten types each from eleven countries including England, America, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, Austria, Netherlands, Soviet Union, Poland, and Denmark, which are quite precious.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The seventh exhibition room contains popular children's reading materials from society, which are the generally poor children's reading materials sold on door panels and book stalls, the so-called "comic strips," such as "Hun Yuan Mirror," "Red-Clad Thief," "Feng Niang," "Trouble at the Dragon Boat Race," "Lord Wu's Private Visit to Nine Human Heads," "Qin Xianglian Bringing Her Child to Find Her Husband, Chen Shimei Denying His Former Wife," etc. There are a total of 229 types. What exactly is the impact of this type of reading material on general underage children? This is really a question that needs attention.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The books displayed this time are divided into three major categories: supplementary reading materials, textbooks, and reference books, further divided into eighteen groups, 2,450 types, and 12,4858 volumes. Among them are letterpress editions, lithographic editions, woodcut editions, with illustrations, five-color lithographs, textbooks, reference books, after-school supplementary reading materials, children's books from various countries, single-volume books, series, journals, periodicals, etc., truly a great variety, a magnificent spectacle.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>On the eve of the opening of the children's book exhibition, the National Children's Year Implementation Committee announced the purpose of holding the exhibition to society. In essence, there are about the following points: (1) To provide a general overview for the Chinese people to correct their perceptions of children's books; (2) To provide research for experts to improve and select children's books; (3) To provide a reference for the literary world, hoping that both new and old writers will devote more effort to compiling and writing children's books. In addition, it is hoped that the publishing industry will solicit more manuscripts in the future and improve printing and binding, so that children's books can be refined and improved, in order to benefit children.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The exhibition is scheduled to run from January 30th to February 5th. After the closing, it is planned to be transported to major cities across the country for a roving exhibition, to arouse the attention of adults and children nationwide. (1.31.1 Fan)</p>

<p>Dan fell safely; but the bough, suddenly relieved of half its weight, flew as suddenly upward, sending Don, who was performing a somersault in his haste to alight first, off his balance, so that he tumbled down in a heap.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing; I shall be all right in a minute,” he said, as he sat up, rather pale, and a little dizzy, while the lads gathered round him with wondering admiration.</p>
<p>“You are a brick, Don, and I’m awfully obliged,” said Nat.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t anything,” muttered Don, slowly scrambling up.</p>
<p>“I say it was a jolly good thing to do, and I’ll shake hands, though you are –” Nat stopped the unlucky word on his tongue, and held out his hand, feeling himself uncommonly magnanimous.</p>
<p>“I don’t care to shake hands with a sneak;” said Don, giving him a withering glance as he spoke, and Nat, remembering the wash, retreated in haste.</p>
<p>“Come, old fellow; let me help you along;” and Ned walked him away, leaving the others to discuss Don and to declare that ‘the old fellow had better burn that infernal money, than have such a row about it.’</p>

<p>Eight teams joined the competition for the Chinese Football Association Group B Cup, and after several eliminations, Guangdong and Yousheng teams won the final rights. The two teams played against each other at Shen Garden at 10:00 AM yesterday to determine who would win the championship. In the first half, the offense and defense were evenly matched, and each had little development. It was not until about six or seven minutes before the end that Yousheng's defense was slightly lacking, and Lin Guoyong of Guangdong headed in a goal. In the subsequent battle, the two sides sprinted even more fiercely. Because Guangdong's rear defense was tight, Yousheng had no chance to take advantage, and instead Zhao Jie and Zhang Ziquan attacked the goal one after another. As a result, Guangdong won by a score of three to zero, winning the championship of the cup. The Progressive Association presented a silver cup.

<h3 id="e191">The Process of Solving the Soviet Grain Problem <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Binglian</p>
<p>——From the Implementation to the Abolition of the Bread Rationing System</p>
<p>Following the October Revolution, Russia's domestic production was at a standstill due to the impact of years of war, and the national economy was almost completely bankrupt. Coupled with the economic blockade and military encirclement by international imperialism, the Soviet Union faced an extremely serious grain problem. During this period, famine was almost universal throughout the Soviet Union. It was not until the implementation of the New Economic Policy that the Soviet proletariat was able to escape from extreme hunger and thirst. However, the grain problem remained very serious in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>With the commencement of the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government formally established a bread rationing system to ensure the supply of grain to industrial centers and agricultural areas. When this system began to be implemented, the Soviet Union had already overcome the chaos, instability, and famine of the early days, and the national economy gradually stabilized. However, the number of collective farms and Soviet farms in the country was still small. Although the system of private land ownership had been abolished, the wealthy peasants had not been completely eliminated. Agricultural technology lagged behind industrial technology, and yields were low, giving the independent small-scale peasant economy an advantage. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Soviet government had to adopt the bread rationing system to ensure the policy and speed of industrialization, improve the backwardness of agriculture, and promote the economic interests and technological development of rural areas. They feared that the backwardness of small-scale peasant agriculture would affect industrial development. Therefore, they had to consider the grain supply to workers, cities, and raw material production areas for light industry.</p>
<p>At the end of 1928 and the beginning of 1929, as soon as the bread rationing system was implemented, the Soviet government immediately concentrated 650 million poods (one pood equals 36.11 pounds) of grain, controlled the grain market to prevent grain speculation, and used state-organized grain supply to control grain distribution. The government set fixed prices and distributed grain to workers in industrial raw material production areas and industrial centers.</p>
<p>This system was first implemented in Leningrad and Moscow, and then gradually spread to other regions. At that time, the implementation of this system caused wavering among the right-wing and "left-wing" elements within the Soviet Communist Party. They opposed attacking the remnants of capitalism and opposed collectivization in the countryside. However, the Soviet government overcame their fallacies and resolutely implemented this decision until the victory of socialist construction was achieved.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the bread rationing system in 1928, the state grain reserves in the Soviet Union increased year by year. By 1934, the grain reserves under state control had reached 1.5 billion poods, an increase of about 2.5 times compared to 1928. Moreover, the sources of grain reserves also underwent significant changes during these years. In 1929, 86 percent of the stored grain came from independent farmers, while collective farms accounted for only 14 percent. This means that the small-scale peasant economy still held a significant advantage in 1929. However, in 1934, the situation was very different, or rather, it was the opposite of 1929: collective farms and state-owned farms accounted for 92 percent of the stored grain in that year, while independent farmers accounted for only 8 percent. This demonstrates the significant victory of collectivization in the countryside.</p>
<p>The number of people receiving centralized grain supply, in other words, the number of people eligible for bread ration coupons, also increased year by year. In terms of the urban population alone, it had increased by 14.3 million between 1930 and 1934. In 1930, only 16 million urban workers had bread ration coupons, while in 1934, the number had reached 40.3 million, including 1.07 million with special coupons, 11.8 million with Class A coupons, 9.6 million with Class B coupons, and 8.6 million with Class C coupons. Among these four types of coupons, special coupons and Class A coupons enjoyed priority in supply.</p>
<p>People who had bread ration coupons could collect their grain according to the amount specified on the coupons at that time. Otherwise, they could only buy from state-owned stores, but the price of this free purchase method was several times higher than the state-set price. According to statistics from 1930, out of the 154 million people in the Soviet Union, 64.3 million had bread ration coupons, while the remaining 90.7 million had to buy grain from state-owned stores. At that time, the eligibility for bread ration coupons was generally stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>Workers participating in socialist construction, whether laborers in factories or farms.</p>
<p>Staff of government agencies and stores, and students in schools.</p>
<p>Family members of laborers, and those whose health was harmed due to state affairs—the disabled.</p>
<p>In other words, those who did not participate in socialist construction did not have the right to receive grain supply in the Soviet Union. On the contrary, the more workers strived to engage in socialist construction, the more preferential treatment they received. The government set fixed prices for the most hardworking workers, allowing them to enjoy the most privileged rights because the price of private grain was very high at that time, sometimes even exceeding the state-set price by more than 40 times.</p>
<p>For those who did not have bread ration coupons, the system was naturally very inconvenient for them. However, the Soviet government had to do so in order to implement their plans. The only way to remedy this inconvenience at that time was to expand the development of state-owned stores and cooperatives and eliminate private commerce. At the same time, efforts were made to increase the source of grain (production) year by year to ensure the grain supply, and then restore normal operations. The Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee of the Soviet Union repeatedly discussed this point, which is why they decided to abolish the bread rationing system in November 1934. This decision was not accidental, just as the implementation of the bread rationing system in 1928 had its inevitable factors.</p>
<p>First, there was a large increase in state-owned stores and cooperatives and a rapid elimination of private commerce during these years. This is reflected in the following figures:——</p>
<p>(Total number of state-owned stores and cooperatives)</p>
<p>1928 123,000</p>
<p>1934 283,000</p>
<p>In 1928, there were still 215,000 private stores, accounting for 63% of all commerce. However, by 1934, they had all been eliminated. Therefore, the development of state commerce replaced private commerce, which also determined the trend of abolishing the bread rationing system.</p>
<p>Molotov said in the report on the abolition of the bread rationing system: "The development of commerce is of great significance for the abolition of the bread rationing system. Therefore, we will pay special attention to it... Retail commerce has greatly increased in the past four years. The following table shows the annual increase rate:</p>
<p>1931 3% 1933 15%</p>
<p>1932 11% 1934 24%</p>
<p>If commercial transactions now account for one-quarter of commercial circulation, then industrial products should account for one-third of commercial transactions. Commercial transactions are now of great significance for normal supply."</p>
<p>Secondly, the increase in grain sources (production) has led to a reduction in grain prices in recent years, which is also of great significance for abolishing the bread rationing system. In Moscow, comparing September 1934 with September 1933, the rate of decline in grain prices is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Rye bread 37% Wheat flour 47%</p>
<p>Rye flour 33% Millet 44%</p>
<p>Wheat bread 25%</p>
<p>According to statistics from 1930, the increase in products from collective farms has increased to about 75% of the imports into 28 large cities. From this, it can be seen that the increase in grain has a great impact on the abolition of the bread rationing system. Moreover, due to the strengthening of trade in collective farms and the development of state commerce, the Party and the government considered that the adjustment of commercial rice should improve commerce, and should not reduce its role. Therefore, in the summer of 1934, the Soviet government, according to Stalin's suggestion, organized the Internal Trade Committee to strengthen the development of trade. This also has a great relationship with the abolition of the bread rationing system.</p>
<p>The implementation of the bread rationing system was to ensure the industrial development and rural economic transformation of the Soviet Union, and its abolition was due to the large increase in grain production and the transition to the development of grain trade.</p>
<p>In his report, Molotov finally clearly stated the significance of abolishing the bread rationing system, saying: "The significance of abolishing the bread rationing system lies in continuing to improve the supply to cities and villages, and further meet the needs of the people. Replacing bread rations with grain trade is a sign of the development of the Soviet Union, the change in the rural economy, and the victory of socialized eating. Because we are stronger than before, we have abolished the bread rationing system. This decision is of great significance to the national economy, not only enough to improve the supply to the people, but also enough to intensify political consolidation. In addition, it can develop Soviet commerce and consolidate the price of the ruble. The abolition of the bread rationing system indicates that the main task of the Second Five-Year Plan has been completed; after that, it will be how to develop trade and abolish the bread rationing system."</p>
<p>In November, after the Soviet government decided to abolish the bread rationing system, it began to implement it on January 1, 1935.</p>
<p>According to the estimates of the Soviet authorities, at least 120 million poods of wheat can be stored in 1935 to maintain the grain supply until the new wheat is on the market. Moreover, there is still a lot of grain left over from previous stores, which can be enough to supply the market. According to the statistics of the State Harvest Committee, the harvest in 1934 was the same as the previous year, and because of the improvement in harvest technology, 250 million to 300 million poods more could be harvested. Therefore, the implementation of the abolition of the bread rationing system can be effectively guaranteed.</p>
<p>After the abolition of the bread rationing system, the state must first set the price of bread and increase the wages of workers. At the same time, increase the production of cooperative bread, especially to increase the production and development of bread in areas where bread production is lagging behind. Because the change in the price of bread and flour will affect the price of general food, especially if the price of wheat is too low, it is easy to promote speculation and waste wheat. Therefore, the government must curb and consider this dangerous tendency.</p>
<p>At the same time, because the price of bread has increased slightly due to the abolition of bread coupons, the wages of workers must also be increased accordingly to adapt to this new living condition. And pay the workers in cash to facilitate the application of the market and stabilize the value of the Soviet currency - the ruble.</p>
<p>Due to the stability of the ruble price, commodity prices have also fallen, which is a great improvement in the lives of the Soviet people. On November 15, 1935, the Soviet government further unified the standards of commodity prices, abolished the state-owned store system and reformed the currency system to adapt domestic trade to foreign trade. This increased the convenience of purchasing for the general public. Moreover, because of the reduction in commodity prices, the wages of workers have been increased invisibly. According to the order of the Soviet government in September 1935, the bread coupon system was further abolished in October of this year, and it was completely abolished on January 1, 1936.</p>
<p>A TASS dispatch from Moscow on September 26 stated:</p>
<p>"...The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the People's Committee decided that from October 1, the prices of bread, flour, coarse and fine flour, grains, pasta, rice, and confectionery will be reduced across the board, and the quota rationing system for meat products, fats, sugar, and potatoes will be abolished. The State Cooperative will sell them to the people at the national unified prices in each region. The price reductions for various commodities in Moscow are as follows:</p>
<p>Bread reduced by 15%</p>
<p>Rye flour reduced by 24%</p>
<p>Wheat flour reduced by 14%</p>
<p>Coarse flour reduced by 4% to 13%</p>
<p>Rice reduced by 19%</p>
<p>Fish and meat reduced by 36% strongly</p>
<p>Granulated sugar reduced by 30%</p>
<p>Block reduced by 35%</p>
<p>Butter reduced by 31%</p>
<p>Artificial cheese reduced by 30%</p>
<p>Potatoes reduced by 14%</p>
<p>The prices of other commodities in other regions are reduced in proportion."</p>
<p>In addition, according to a TASS communication from Grozny on October 22, there are also records of the development of commerce in the Soviet Union after the abolition of the bread coupon system. The original text reads: "During the First and Second Five-Year Plans, the retail commerce of the Soviet Union increased more than sixfold. This year (1935), the domestic retail commerce has increased by 35%. At the same time, the prices of various important foods have also seen a rapid and systematic decline. In the past three months, there have been more than 30 kinds of price reductions. On October 1 this year, compared with the commodity prices in December last year, the price of bread was reduced to one-half, the price of sugar was reduced to one-third, and the price of rice and meat was reduced to two-thirds. The prices of butter, vegetable oil, and bacon were reduced to one-half. In the first half of this year, urban consumers saved 600 million rubles due to price reductions. The activation of commerce resulted in the complete abolition of various food coupons on October 1 this year. At present, hundreds of new food stores selling meat, fish, milk, and bread have been added in various cities and villages. The goods are abundant, and the Soviet food industry has exceeded its planned production by tens of millions of pounds this year. The annual plan for butter, cheese, and sausages has been completed. The Soviet Union's reduction of commodity prices has not only failed to weaken commerce, but has also made it prosper rapidly. In the first two weeks of October, the turnover in Moscow reached 425,005,000 rubles. The sales of butter and vegetable oil have increased by onefold, and meat, fish, and sugar have also increased greatly. State-owned and cooperative stores have abundant goods. Not only have food prices been reduced, but also the prices of fabrics, soap, tobacco, and other categories have also been reduced. In October, the average price of meat in various cities in the Soviet Union was reduced by 30% compared to September, and the average price of butter was reduced by 20%. Therefore, the resolution of the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party to reduce retail prices by 35% during the Second Five-Year Plan has been realized.</p>
<p>From the above telegrams, it seems that the progress of the Soviet Union's abolition of the bread coupon system has generally achieved great results. If it is compared with the famine in the initial chaotic state and the serious grain problem that is occurring, it is truly impossible to calculate. Although the Soviet Union's abolition of the bread coupon system today is not considered to have completely solved the grain problem, it has at least achieved a further expression, which is probably undoubted. On the contrary, if we look back at the current economic panic that is happening in the capitalist world (including colonies and semi-colonies), there is serious unemployment, famine, disasters, and wars everywhere... pushing the masses into the sea of death... it is truly incomparable.</p>
<p>Let us cite the recent "Political Daily" of Denmark, the "Prague Daily" of Czechoslovakia, and the Berlin communication in the "Truth Daily" of the Soviet Union, which reported on the real situation of the food panic in the "Third Reich" Germany under Hitler's rule, to make a clear comparison with the improvement of the current grain problem in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Czech "Prague Daily" said on November 3: "In recent days, the lack of butter and other oils in Germany has been extremely acute. The queues in front of food stores are getting longer every day. People have to spend three hours to buy a quarter of a pound of butter, and sometimes they can't even buy it. General housewives are troubled and disappointed. Although they often stand in front of the stores, they still can't get the oil products necessary for their homes. Not only is there no butter, but also artificial cheese and lard will be gone. There is also a great lack of other foods."</p>
<p>The Soviet "Truth Daily" said on November 4: "Recently, the difficulty of food in Berlin has intensified, which shows the deterioration of the national economic situation in Germany. The lines in front of food stores have become a daily phenomenon. These lines are getting longer every day. The quantity of food that consumers can buy is decreasing very rapidly... Now butter, lard, pork, and other oils are sold according to the prescribed standards. Although the standards for the sale of butter, artificial cheese, and butter have not yet been prescribed, the prices of these foods have already soared, which is beyond the reach of the general public. In Germany, the cheapest and most popular food is pork. Recently, although the official has raised the price of meat and strictly prohibits further price increases, there is still an unusual shortage of pork. In the past few days, the price of meat has soared by 20%.</p>
<p>The Danish "Political Daily" also said on November 2: "The prices prescribed by the official are generally not observed. All foods in the city secretly raise prices. The prices of meat scraps consumed by the poor, which are not managed by the official, have soared by 60% within a few days. Although there is police interference in the queues in front of the stores, the voices of opposition are endless. Construction workers in enterprises in the northern part of Berlin have announced a strike, saying that their stomachs are very hungry and they have to separate to seek food."</p>
<p>If we analyze this comparison clearly, we can find the realistic factors that are inevitably reflected in the period of capitalist decline. However, this is not limited to the issue of grain. Therefore, the discussion of the grain problem in the Soviet Union should not be regarded as a simple problem, because it is closely related to the economic development in the Soviet Union. Sometimes, from the progress of the grain problem, we can even see the domestic political changes or stability. The current grain panic in the "Third Reich" is a good example. December 28, 1935</p>
<h3 id="e192">Preconditions for China's Grain Control <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>The importance of the current food problem lies in the shortage of rice and grain. To preserve a sufficient amount of food for the people for regulation and control, the following conditions must first be met. New-style warehouses must be built. The current warehouses for storing rice and grain are mostly old-style grain warehouses or renovated rented houses. The rice and grain stored are mostly commercial goods, and due to financial conditions, they must be taken out of the warehouse and turned over in a few months. Therefore, in terms of storage equipment, there is no need for any special equipment. However, as Japan has a lot of rice and grain, it can be preserved for more than ten years. Then, its warehouse equipment is definitely not comparable to profit-making properties. Therefore, our country must, at the very least, ensure that some of the food can be preserved for several years without changing. The quantity of rice and grain stockpiled nationwide must be controlled. Because the current grain warehouses in various places and the rice and grain warehouses with commercial behavior are tools for middlemen to hoard and speculate on the food of the people. Whenever new grain is harvested, they use low prices to purchase rice in large quantities from farmers, stockpile it in warehouses, and wait for a good price to sell it. If this kind of behavior is not controlled, it will also affect the future of the food of the people. Therefore, the volume of existing warehouses in each place should be registered first, and then the needs of a certain place should be verified, and the number of commercial operations should be allocated. If there are surplus warehouses, they should be leased or purchased by the government. The processing industry of food nationwide must be registered. Rice has a short storage period, while grain has a long storage period. Therefore, grain cannot be stored for a long time after it is ground into rice. Therefore, the third condition for preserving the food of the people is to pay attention to the problem of grinding grain. At present, the grinding of grain by the people is mostly unrestricted. They only want the mill to keep turning, regardless of the consumption of grain. In order to preserve the food of the people, the grain mill industry nationwide should be registered first so that restrictions can be imposed when necessary.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the financial market remained calm. However, banks were closed for the holiday, so business was relatively quiet. Foreign exchange rates saw no increase or decrease, remaining at 6%. Call loan transactions amounted to over 1.8 million, with new transactions exceeding 300,000. Money shops cleared over 3.5 million in foreign public notes. Remittances totaled over 300,000. Auxiliary currency transactions were minimal, with only 60,000 jiao of Guangdong small coins traded.

<h3 id="e196">The Stock Market Before the Unified Bond Issue <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Last week (January 27th to February 1st), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was preparing for the start of March futures trading, following the January futures delivery, and it was also the start of the Lunar New Year red market. Due to various factors, it experienced unprecedented changes. Trading only occurred on two of the six days. Monday was the last day of closure, and Thursday and Friday were for delivery. Saturday saw an effective halt. The surge and plunge in market prices caused considerable volatility. The fundamental reason for this was entirely due to the interest rate reduction and postponement. Amidst this ambiguous situation, large investors were heavily engaged in speculation. The Ministry of Finance then ordered a thorough investigation and restricted short sellers, requiring them to submit the actual goods. They were also required to cover previous short positions with the actual goods. Yesterday's report mentioned the Ministry of Finance's decision to issue 146 million in unified public bonds, divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E, to recall all previously issued bonds and issue 34 million in Reconstruction Bonds for exchange within a four-month period starting from February 1st. The Exchange will likely face various disputes and difficulties when handling the February futures delivery. It is expected that the authorities will have remedial measures. Regarding last week's events, Tuesday's red market was also the last day of January futures trading. It briefly rose but then fell sharply. The January six contract experienced a severe limit down. On Wednesday, only the March futures contract was traded. Due to the requirement of submitting the actual goods, retail investors covered their short positions, causing a sharp rise of several jiao to as much as 3.6 yuan. Thursday and Friday were market closures for January futures delivery. Saturday encountered extreme difficulties and failed to open. The March futures contract therefore failed to begin trading. There are significant questions about whether it can open today. The market price results showed both increases and decreases. A list is provided below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>According to a report from New Feng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on the 1st saw mixed results and extremely long trading hours. In the morning, it continued the previous day's gains and advanced further. Subsequently, those with floating long profits gradually emerged. Oil and steel resulted in stabilization.

<p>According to yesterday's New York cotton telegram, foreign traders were taking profits on long positions, resulting in a two-pound gain for the near-term contract, while the remaining months all fell by six to nine pounds. At the same time, the Liverpool telegram showed that contracts for all months fell by eight to eleven points.

<p>After the price increase, large bars of lead saw a sluggish sales. However, since the New Year, tea shops have begun to show activity, and inquiries have also increased from Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Fuzhou, and other groups. As a result, the standard price has risen to 22.5 yuan per dan. Yesterday, over 200 bars were offered in the market. As for local lead, the estimated price was 21 yuan per dan, with transactions limited to factories in this street, and out-of-town buyers seemed unmoved.</p>

<p>Small Guangdong leather has recently seen orders from enamel factories, Tianjin groups, and others, and thermos factories also occasionally add to the demand, making the market quite lively. The standard quoted price is 10 yuan per bundle. Although yesterday was Sunday, there were still 300 to 400 bundles transacted. In addition, the market for large Guangdong leather is experiencing oversupply, leading to a decline in sentiment and a softening of prices, with quotations around 9 yuan per bundle. Although traders are making every effort to raise prices, the environment feels insurmountable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended towards stabilization. The guild quotations for #24 coarse granulated white spot and re-export goods were at the original prices. Dongchi and #8/9 Dongbai also lacked increases or decreases, with few transactions. As for domestic Chaoqing sugar, sales have not yet significantly increased. The quotations here, except for a slight increase for the above types, have not yet been released for lower grades. According to the Shantou telegram, production prices have suddenly risen by 3-4 jiao due to low arrivals and increased sales from various groups. Spot Zhuangqing has risen to 10 yuan, up 4 jiao. Huanggang Qing is 9.45 yuan, up 3.5 jiao. Jieqing and Xiqing are both 9.4 yuan, up 4.5 jiao. Nanqing is 8.6 yuan, and Longgang Qing is 8.2 yuan, up 3 and 2.5 jiao respectively. The Shantou exchange rate is 1028 yuan. Adding all external expenses, the price in Shanghai would have to exceed 3-5 jiao. Therefore, quotations are on hold to observe. If traders become more active, prices are expected to rise accordingly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, our factory's cotton white sugar fell by a small jiao. Zhenji #1 was 21.5 yuan, #2 was 21.3 yuan, #3 was 21.1 yuan, #4 was 20.9 yuan, and #5 was 20.7 yuan.</p>

<p>During the Shanghai Incident in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), our army fought bitterly for over thirty days. Among them, the battle of Miaohangzhen was the longest and suffered the most casualties. The remains of the martyred generals have been buried at the foot of Zijin Mountain. For the remaining soldiers and the civilians who died in the disaster, it was proposed at the time to build a Tomb of the Unknown Hero in the southeast corner of the town. I once wrote a long poem in mourning. The years have passed, and five years have passed. Recently, the tomb has been completed. Therefore, I re-examined the old manuscript and wrote it for the gods, and I hope to cry together with all the caring people in the country. (Hu Junfu)</p>
<p>The road is winding and the car is far away, the clouds are dissolving and the sky is high. My heart is annoyed by injustice and my words are clumsy, my tears are about to run dry and my eyes are scorched. I would rather mutter to the wall in a dream than shout in vain in distress. Spring river moon, autumn river tide, a wine flag one foot lightly waving. Three or five village houses are not trimmed with thatch. Don't dislike the light taste, pour turbid wine. I will invite butchers and wine sellers to play. You strike the building block and I play the panpipes. Gentlemen and ladies offer flowers and sing. Broken rivers and mountains are a burden to bear. It is rare to come to the world once. You are all good brothers, I am distressed by the extinction of my essence. There are few bones and a desolate soul here, as if I hear the wind and rain calling in the middle of the night, and like thunder and lightning in the empty dust. The tomb is inscribed with five characters, a stone of ten feet, which will compete with the peaks of the Himalayas. Standing upright and reaching the sky for thousands of generations, even a robbery fire cannot burn it. Moreover, flowers and bamboo bloom in all seasons, and the fragrance is intertwined. It is the residence of dragons and the nest of phoenixes. Gods come to play and travel, no children are allowed to pick firewood, wolves and leopards stay away and foxes escape. Alas! A gentleman's death is heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather. The weight of a feather and Mount Tai is the same, but pine and cypress wither later. Life is noble and lowly, death is equal, life is not free, death is free. The great events in the world are not yet finished, and the buried mounds cannot be poured. Suddenly a dream of a deer overturning a banana tree. Buddha said that becoming a Buddha is not a matter of one morning. Come back with a wish, the body is strong and firm. All sentient beings in the world are seeds of Buddha, sacrificing themselves to feed tigers is also heroic. Alas! Famous and nameless are trivial, but being able to produce heroes is not lonely. I want to whisper to the people in the tomb, but I am afraid that worldly eyes will not recognize and be ridiculed. Alas! Raising a pen is like a sword out of its sheath, truly laboring and worrying to write a portrait for you. Unless I die beside the tomb of Yao Li, burn the pen and inkstone and wield a big knife. Otherwise, bury the poem in the tomb of poetry, and also know that the Yangtze River flowing east cannot wash it away. The soul of poetry becomes an immortal and rides on the clouds with you.

<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>A "calendar" is, in a way, an inanimate object. However, throughout the 365 days of the year, it constantly changes its face for you to see. If you don't believe it, look! Right before your eyes, that thick stack of paper is coming to an end with only a few pages of days remaining. If it were truly dead, then: what is passing by like flying?</p>
<p>Therefore, the "calendar," though hanging on the wall or placed on the table, seems to tell us every day, from morning to night, not to easily miss out. Moreover, month after month, it never fails to indicate the designated days. And when it comes to the week, it very clearly presents itself before your eyes, teaching you that this day is for rest! However, it faithfully shows that each day has its own light. Some people, however, don't interact with the "calendar" day by day. For example, if the 20th is torn off, and then every five or six days, or even more than ten days later, one grabs a stack and tears them off, you think about it, living such a muddled life! The "calendar" has not failed you, but you have indeed offended the "calendar," you must admit it!</p>
<p>Therefore, the "calendar" cannot speak, but on the last day of the year, it really cannot help but shout, "What great things have you done this year? In the end, you only end up betraying the country, earning yourself a 'traitor' title, calling and running around, better than several thousand elementary school students!" Alas! The "calendar" truly seems extremely angry, vaguely shouting to all the people of China.</p>

<p>Wang Shicheng said, "Ten thousand yuan is not a small amount, but our piece of land is also not small." As he spoke, he touched his body and took out a cotton paper drawing, handing it to Jia Duocai to see. The size of the land on the drawing, and how the four boundaries were, were all written clearly. And a piece of land on the eastern boundary was written as the Tang family's land, totaling two acres and seven fen, which was exactly the piece of land that the bank had entrusted them to buy. According to the current land price, it is worth at least 17,000 or 18,000 yuan. And Jin Ziqiang is only giving people 10,000 yuan, including the section in Xianyang, which is a great bargain. So he nodded twice and said, "The goods are sold to those who know their value. According to your meaning, how much money do you want?" Wang Shicheng said, "It can't be considered my meaning, it can only be said to be the meaning of my clan. They want a total of 15,000 or 16,000." Jia Duocai smiled and said, "If you talk about bargaining, it can't be considered too much, but the goods are sold to those who love them. If the buyer wants them or doesn't want them, and doesn't think much of this piece of land, you still want to sell it for a high price, that is naturally impossible." Jin Ziqiang heard Jia Duocai say these words, which simply broke his deal, and he was naturally very unhappy in his heart. But he had welcomed him in very warmly, and now he couldn't just chase him out, so he took out the cigar he was holding in his mouth, slowly tapping it on the edge of the table, and looked at Jia Duocai and said, "If you say this, brother, this brother Wang will not sell it even more. It's not that I necessarily want to covet Mr. Wang's family property, but I think Mr. Wang's land is too large, and he wants to sell it together with that piece of land in Xianyang. May I ask, at a time when the train is still so far away, no matter what business you do, everyone has no certainty, who would be willing to spend a lot of money to buy a vacant lot and leave it idle here?" Wang Shicheng finished drinking that cup of tea, slowly put down the teacup, his face blank, as if thinking about something. Then he slowly stood up, smiled faintly, and said, "I'll take my leave first, we'll talk another day." After he finished speaking, he stood up again, and looked as if he was about to leave. Mai Duocai stretched out his hand and stopped him, and smiled, "The mountain doesn't turn, the road turns. Doing such a big business is not like buying vegetables at the fire door, where you can settle the deal with just a few words. If you don't sell it to Mr. Jin, is there no one else who wants it?"

<h3 id="e208">Another Pose of Xi Shi <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Shen</p>
<p>Last autumn, the Hangzhou Authors Association, National Academy of Art, Southeast Daily, and China Cultural Construction Association jointly hosted a banquet for the Shanghai Theater teachers and students at the Jinghu Hall on the north shore of West Lake. At that time, the most noticeable thing for Hangzhou people was the handshake and photo of the Shanghai Xi Shi and the Hangzhou Xi Shi.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the two Xi Shis have the same surname, Cheng, and they both have the same high nose bridge. Of course, the young woman who is generally recognized as being able to play Xi Shi has a considerable beauty, without the need for excessive adjectives such as "shutting the moon and shaming the flowers."</p>
<p>Cheng Jingzi, the so-called "Shanghai Xi Shi," has facial contours rich in Oriental colors. Therefore, according to some actors in the Shanghai Theater, when Chen Dabe was examining new students through the Vocational Education Society, he discovered this little girl with Xi Shi's appearance hiding in a corner. Later, after three months of training, this Ms. Cheng indeed showed her surpassing talent in various subjects such as vocal music, dance, and performance. However, because she was young, timid, and lacked social experience, during the rehearsal of the musical "Xi Shi," this Ms. Cheng was still uneasy and felt that she would not live up to the expectations of the public, and repeatedly politely declined Chen Dabe, who was in charge of directing. Dabe just smiled and ignored it. After "Xi Shi" returned with honors from four places in Beijing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi, Ms. Cheng has been noticed by people in both the film and theater industries. If the organizers of the Shanghai Theater had been someone else, this "Shanghai Xi Shi" would have turned into a whirlpool long ago, and who knows what jokes would have been made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I visited "Candle Night" at the Carlton and saw a preview hanging on the wall of the hall, "The Shanghai Theater will perform Chocolate Girl this Sunday," with a small makeup photo of "Ms. Cheng Jingzi of Chocolate Girl" pasted in the middle. Oh dear! This is like a Western girl! Where is there even a trace of oriental color? The beauty Xi Shi of Wu and Yue has transformed into a Chocolate Girl who has captivated the people of Paris, and can do so without revealing a trace. The makeup skills are so miraculous, I can't help but admire Ms. Cheng's talent and the results of the Shanghai Theater's half-year training.</p>
<p>According to the ticket seller at the Carlton, the director of the play, Chen Dabe, also plays the important role of Chocolate King in the play (the father of Chocolate Girl), and it is not just an empty gimmick in the advertisement. Although the performance results are difficult to predict, judging from the "still photos" displayed at the Carlton, this performance must have a considerable contribution in terms of stage technology.</p>

<p>— Seen in Records — (Sun Choucheng)</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, passing through Laoxidou Heping Road, I saw more than a dozen people gathered at the entrance of the Xinhua Bank. Upon closer inspection, there was a boy of eleven or twelve years old, wearing a old and worn bean-paste-colored floral satin jacket, kneeling on the sidewalk, his brows furrowed and locked in sorrow, not saying a word. On the ground, the sixteen characters "Father unemployed, mother ill, suffering from hunger and cold, please help" were written in chalk, and there were more than ten silver dollars in front of his knees. Beside him was a young child of about three or four years old, sitting in a tattered cotton cushion, with tears streaming down his face, which was unbearable to witness. The audience was sighing at his pitifulness, and some were lamenting his cold. Just as they were reaching for money, a man and a woman passed by, arm in arm, and watched for a long time. The woman wanted to take money and give it to him, but the man suddenly stopped her and said, "This is a pretense of poverty, hoping for people to pity them, don't be fooled." And he led her away. The other spectators who were about to take money were stopped, and they all withdrew their hands and scattered like crows and beasts. The boy kneeling on the ground, seeing the spectators about to give him copper coins, but suddenly withholding them, could not help but burst into tears.</p>

<p>On the day of the abolished calendar, it snowed heavily. The trees in the small garden were covered with snow, completely like silver-covered jade carvings. Watching the children playing with snowballs, throwing them at each other, cheering and laughing, happily as if ascending a spring terrace.</p>
<p>On the New Year's Day of the abolished calendar, I didn't go out of the community. I watched the children throwing dice, lighting firecrackers, counting New Year's money, singing and dancing, happily as if ascending a spring terrace.</p>
<p>The time when I remembered red skirts dancing, wasn't I also happily ascending the spring terrace? Now, in my middle age of sorrow and joy, I am gradually declining. Human affairs are becoming more and more entangled, and worries are accumulating day by day. How can I reverse the years and return my childhood heart?</p>

<p>On a journey, I met a judge and casually chatted. He said that the cases he had handled could be summarized as being either for money or for lust!</p>
<p>Originally, in this vast world, how many people can escape the traps of money and lust?</p>
<p>However, knowledgeable people can restrain themselves. Speaking of nature, it can be said categorically that everyone is the same.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can know that the law is only a passive thing. The ancients made laws only as a last resort! It is best to use positive persuasion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the people's violation of the law has a close relationship with the social conditions. If the society is good, the number of people who break the law will naturally decrease. If the society is bad, the number of people who break the law will naturally increase. Only punishing crimes without trying to improve the bad society, its effect can be said to be equal to zero!</p>
<p>Ultimately, we bear this heavy burden to do the work of transforming society. Other issues can be put aside.</p>

Could it be that you are also happy to see me return? Alas, in prison, my life was hanging by a thread! Today, I am fortunate to be safe, but who cares for me besides you?</p>
<p>The grape vine by the window is flourishing, its stems and silk intertwining. The wind brings its graceful sway, dew-kissed and fresh in color. Alas, if I had not returned, for whom would it sway?</p>
<p>And look at the books on the shelf, piled high with dust. And examine the drafts in the drawer, scattered and with remaining incomplete pages. Only the clothes have been completely worn by the guards. There is no doubt about this, the police soldiers may not be virtuous!</p>

<p>Samuel Johnson, the first English lexicographer, came from a poor family. When he was in his third year of university, he had to go out into society to make a living because no one subsidized his tuition. He took a one-act, three-scene play he had written to a publisher to sell, but the publisher, seeing that he did not look good, said to him, "You should become a peddler!</p>

<p>Living next door to me is a certain ×× incense shop. It is said that the old couple who opened this shop are a very superstitious old couple. Therefore, every time I finish washing, I always hear the sound of a wooden fish and the chanting of women. At first, I was a little suspicious, thinking that there must be nuns or witches inside. Later, after my investigation, I found out that the old lady of the shop was chanting sutras and knocking on wooden fish every day! But their son is not like this. Not only does he not have a bit of superstition, but he also serves as a Western doctor in a certain hospital. Of course, he wears a suit and leather shoes in and out, and occasionally reads the mainland newspapers. Isn't this greatly opposite to his father? However, under these two different living conditions, they have never had a conflict. I think this is one of the characteristics of our modern era, so I named it "Contradictory Family."</p>

<h3 id="e216">"Using Barbarians to Control Barbarians" vs. "Using Chinese to Destroy Chinese" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Recently, our "friendly nations" have often expressed dissatisfaction with our country's adoption of the policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians," viewing it as antagonistic towards them. They claim this is a mistake by China and the cause of Sino-foreign hatred, urging China to quickly change its attitude, abandon other countries, and implement "friendly cooperation" with them to jointly advance East Asia towards prosperity. Officials are undoubtedly dissatisfied, constantly considering settling this matter with us. As for the people, there is also much dissatisfaction. Some time ago, a thinker from a "friendly nation" expressed this sentiment. In a letter to a certain Chinese scholar, he plainly stated: "Your country's policy of using barbarians to control barbarians, and its antagonism towards XX, is a well-known fact worldwide. The United States has helped your country in this way, and Britain has also cunningly dealt with XX. And what has Soviet Russia done for your country? How have your representatives advocated for alliance with Russia and accommodation of the Communists? These events are still vividly etched in our memories. And what were the results? We also remember that."</p>
<p>"Using barbarians to control barbarians" is a common international policy. When countries A and B are antagonistic, each often allies with one or two third parties to resist the other. Leaving aside other countries' situations, let's take our "friendly nation" as an example. The past "Anglo-Japanese Alliance" and the recently widely rumored "German-Japanese Alliance" are examples of this policy in action. As for China, the "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy may have been adopted, but it has not been beneficial to our country. We have only ever heard of conspiracies to divide us, and have never seen anyone willing to help our country control other countries. A certain Chinese scholar said it well: "Our country is not worthy of being friends with anyone, and even less worthy of being enemies with anyone. Because friendship is equality, and enmity is also equality."</p>
<p>In reality, the "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy is still fair. The "using Chinese to destroy Chinese" tactic is the truly insidious and terrifying one. Recently, our "friendly nation," while expressing dissatisfaction with our country's adoption of the "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy, is employing the "using Chinese to destroy Chinese" tactic. They personally reached out and seized the land of the four northeastern provinces. But to deceive the world, they created a "puppet state," driving a few Chinese traitors to act as their "running dogs." This is the "using Chinese to destroy Chinese" tactic. The rebellion in eastern Hebei and the establishment of the second "puppet organization" are also the result of the "friendly nation" using the "using Chinese to destroy Chinese" tactic. Furthermore, the North China autonomy movement, which was active for a while recently, is nothing more than a manifestation of this same tactic. In short, the current China policy adopted by our "friendly nation" is not "direct aggression" but "indirect aggression." They exhaust methods of "luring with benefits" and "coercion" to make Chinese traitors submit and betray their country. This tactic is extremely clever; it's a deadly scheme that kills without bloodshed. Unfortunately, some of our nation's madmen are willing to "act as accomplices for the tiger," truly great sinners of the nation. Therefore, we feel that while we must resist foreign insults, we must also eliminate traitors. Because those who will destroy China are not only "foreign enemies" but also "internal traitors."</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Old Boatman <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>The earth was panting, as if unable to withstand the pressure of the sub-zero temperatures.</p>
<p>The sky was frozen in a grey gloom; the northwest wind swept down from the peaks of the Dalongtou Mountains. The whole universe seemed to be immersed in a swimming kiln. The old boatman, A Gen, facing the cold wind and treading on the frozen snow, held the tow rope tightly on his shoulder, and walked along the long embankment of the Wujiu Pond.</p>
<p>He hunched over, pulling down the earflaps of his torn felt hat, while his hands were tucked into his sleeves. He walked step by step, sideways. There was no sound, no shadow, just the effort of pulling the tow rope and hurrying forward. The biting north wind blocked him, forcing him to straighten up and take a breath every few steps.</p>
<p>The harbor water was flowing against the current, and the wind was also blowing against him. The broken little boat slowly drifted on the water three or four feet from the shore, the tow rope bending the short mast into a bow shape. His wife sat on the stern, carefully steering the rudder.</p>
<p>It was already dusk. A few crows returning to their nests in the bare branches of the sparse forest cawed, "Yah! Yah! Yah!" spreading their desolate and melancholic tones into the frozen air.</p>
<p>The earth was grey, the sky was grey, and the old boatman A Gen's mood was also grey.</p>
<p>The small broken boat was loaded with firewood, which he was taking to the town of Shihutou. The small boat was already very old, and now, loaded with dozens of bundles of firewood, the footboards were almost submerged in the water. Water had seeped in through several cracks. The boat was moving exceptionally slowly, like a snail. If the old boatman A Gen stopped even for a moment, it would start to drift backward.</p>
<p>The sound of water lapping under the boat was like a soft sigh. The wind blew against the rope on the bare mast, making a monotonous flapping sound. The surrounding air was stagnant, and the river was quiet. He rarely encountered any passing boats, only occasionally a small, fast inland river steamer cutting through the water and speeding past, causing waves to crash against the embankment, its long, wailing horn echoing through the frozen air. At the same time, the small broken boat shuddered violently, almost pulling the old boatman A Gen off the embankment.</p>
<p>The old boatman A Gen hated the small steamer the most, because it was his life's enemy. Before the fast boat service started on this harbor, his small broken boat was the only small ship carrying passengers and goods on this harbor. He used to make one trip every day, going up one day and down the next, from Shuijing to Shihutou Town, earning at least four or five thousand coins a day. Back then, he even employed three crew members on his boat. Every year around June or July, the small boat would have to be taken ashore for repairs or caulking. For half his life, he had relied on this small boat. Although he hadn't accumulated much extra, he had cleared the debts he owed when his parents died and the expenses of his own wedding. Back then, his wife stayed at home taking care of the children, while he entrusted all the work on the boat to the captain, Ma Zi Er. As soon as the boat set off, he would sit alone on the flat stone surface in the fire cabin, smoking or drinking liquor. But since the fast inland river service started, his livelihood had been suddenly cut off. Moreover, recently there had been more bandits on the river, so shopkeepers were afraid to entrust goods to him, and passengers preferred to take the steamer. Now, he could only make a meager living by carrying firewood or vegetables for others.</p>
<p>He walked along, thinking, the mud under his feet frozen as hard as stone. The wind howled fiercely, and the earth seemed to be on its last breath. Tragic colors and a sorrowful atmosphere wove a curtain that blurred before his eyes.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the trees and paths became blurred outlines. Only the sound of the ruthless northwest wind was so loud that it seemed to be uprooting the bare trees. The outside of the old boatman A Gen's body was as cold as ice, but his heart was burning with anxiety. He was both anxious and afraid, but he couldn't walk any faster.</p>
<p>It was still about seven li from Shihutou Town, but it was already dark. He had to wipe his running nose with his hand, use his hem to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, and stop to gather the tow rope:</p>
<p>"Light the lamp, we can't tow anymore, let's row!" he said to his wife on the shore.</p>
<h3 id="e218">New Street Square <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Cong Long</p>
<p>—One of Impressions of the South Seas—</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Malaya, in the South Seas archipelago, is one of the world's richest tin-producing regions. New Street Square is indeed a famous tin-producing area in Malaya, a giant!</p>
<p>The distance from Kuala Lumpur to New Street Square is nine miles. By train, it costs only two cents to go back and forth. If you want comfort and speed, taking a public bus will only cost you eight cents more.</p>
<p>On a sunny day after a rain, I finally carved out half a day to visit the tin area - New Street Square - for a half-day trip. As I rode on the lightning-fast public bus, feeling the cool breeze on my face, the melancholy hidden in my heart was blown away. I deeply felt: Even the tropical South Seas have this refreshing weather!</p>
<p>The bus left the city area of Kuala Lumpur, gliding lightly through the fields like smoke. Along the way, we passed through villages. Massive iron factories stood tall along the roadside, booming loudly. Piles of atap houses crouched low in the fields, like wild beasts, seemingly afraid of escaping from the booming sounds of the iron factory. The road became increasingly uneven, and the speed of the bus decreased.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at New Street Square, whether on high mountains or flat ground, looking all around, chimneys stood in forests, like a burnt forest, the burnt remains standing as charcoal-black pillars on the open hillsides. Smoke billowed from the chimney openings, rippling in the air. Tin wells were everywhere, like many holes left after being washed by rain. The engines started one after another, echoing each other with incessant booms in the ears. Besides this, New Street Square had no other ancient monuments, scenic spots, or cool places for people to admire, stroll, or linger.</p>
<p>However, almost 90 percent of the residents here are our overseas Chinese compatriots. The largest tin wells also belong to our overseas Chinese compatriots.</p>
<p>Along the steep muddy road, we walked slowly past the public banana plantation and the sand embankment before taking a shortcut to the wells to see the tin mines.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the tin well, the sun was already setting. In the open sky, layers of deep grey velvet clouds rippled, seemingly a sign of rain. However, from time to time, a ray of sunlight shone through the gaps in the clouds. While panting, I kept taking out the handkerchief in my pocket to wipe the sweat from my forehead, climbing towards the tin well with an unsteady gait. When I reached a place where I could stand, I leaned forward to look into the magnificent project inside the tin well. Countless winding iron rails and heavy water pumps were working with rattling booms, mixed with the "ai-he" sounds of the workers, interweaving into a rhythmic song playing in the workshop.</p>
<p>I continued to climb upward, laboriously climbing to the tin-sifting bed, the highest point in the tin well. The spring water in the tin well all converged here, and the water flowed like a waterfall, rustling. Then, the tin sand was scooped up by countless tin-sifting workers from one ditch after another.</p>
<p>Seeing that the sun was about to kiss the mountains, the evening clouds embraced the orange-yellow sunset. The surrounding scenery was enveloped in smoke and clouds, presenting a dim color.</p>
<p>The magnificent tin well project and the spectacle of the sunset in the smoke and clouds were the deeply etched impressions of my half-day trip to New Street Square, which are still clearly etched in my mind.</p>

<h3 id="e219">A Record of Visiting the Chiba Soy Sauce Business in Japan (2) <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— (Ye Xiyuan)</p>
<p>From the Tang Dynasty until now, China and Japan have been manufacturing soy sauce using nearly the same original techniques. With the Meiji Restoration, the Industrial Revolution of Western Europe was also brought to Japan. The use of machinery fundamentally transformed production methods. Soy sauce, which had always been a special product of East Asian handicrafts, now had people attempting to mechanize its production. Recently, Japanese industry has advanced by leaps and bounds in everything. Even soy sauce, which had always been a handicraft, has emerged in Japan as a large-scale, mechanized production. Meanwhile, our soy sauce industry remains stuck in the primitive handicraft era, causing endless sighs of despair. Soy sauce can be said to be a uniquely East Asian product. Applying Western technology to the unique products of East Asia has allowed it to break free from the primitive handicraft era and become a large-scale modern enterprise. On this point, we cannot help but admire the Japanese for their extraordinary spirit and perseverance. To understand their business in order to lay the groundwork for the modernization of our country's soy sauce industry, the author traveled to Japan in 1931 to observe their achievements. However, since returning from Japan until now, three or four years have passed quickly. During this time, relations between China and Japan have been constantly uncertain, and our country's economic vitality has been declining. The hopes of the past remain just hopes, with no day in sight for their realization. When I recall the ambitions I had when I set out and pick up my pen to write this article, how can my heart not be filled with endless sadness?</p>
<p>Japan's soy sauce industry is mostly concentrated in three areas. One is the Kanto Chiba area, another is the Kansai Wakayama area, and the other is the Kyushu Fukuoka area. Some are famous for producing so-called light soy sauce, such as "Tatsuno" in Kansai. Some are famous for producing soy sauce using the so-called "fast brewing" method, such as "Nihon Jozo" in Tokyo. However, the largest companies with the widest sales are mostly in Chiba. Historically, Chiba has also been the most developed area for the soy sauce industry in Japan. This may be because Chiba's climate and water are particularly suitable for making soy sauce, or it may be because it is close to Edo (Tokyo), and word spread due to the propagation by high officials and nobles. Perhaps because the Shogunate was in Edo, Chiba's soy sauce industry developed as a result. In any case, judging from the overall situation of the soy sauce industry in Japan, the development of Chiba's soy sauce industry was relatively late. Because if the soy sauce making techniques were passed down from China, they would naturally have first developed in Kyushu and the Kansai area.</p>

<p>Opening "Old New Year"</p>
<p>The wax plum's fragrance permeates the wax bottle anew. Poetic and artistic sentiments bind my heart. I drink pepper wine alone, pitying my white hair. Hurriedly writing auspicious Spring phrases, I recall red makeup. New Year's Day greetings urge poetic inspiration. Planning feasts and discussions of paintings keep us busy on the Lantern Festival. The world is peaceful, the common people are joyful. The New Year adds years and brings surplus wealth. Gambling games delight the ladies. Drinking games make the guests wild. How long ago did the winds and clouds change? What annoys people most is the damage to national defense. The decline of commerce brings worries about livelihood. The people are displaced by the chaos and panic. Hot blood has been exchanged for a new year. Cold-heartedness is worse than the old writings. I wish the New Year would bring a new national spirit. Let us stake our lives to do our part. Enduring hardship and toil in commerce and industry.</p>

<p>Opening "Plum Blossom"</p>
<p>Although the plum blossom is not the king of flowers. Its character is pure and lofty, surpassing all others. Since ancient times, poets have praised it. Its reputation as the flower champion is unmatched in the world. The chrysanthemum is the recluse among flowers. The lotus is also regarded as a gentleman. Zhou Zi loved the lotus, Tao loved the chrysanthemum. The two men's ideals were not ordinary. Little do they know. The plum is both a recluse and a gentleman. Its nature is gentle, its character is high, and its appearance is dignified. The world often praises peach and plum blossoms. Peach blossoms are enchanting, and plum blossoms are fragrant. That plum blossom. Only settles for the ordinary. Unwilling to follow the fashion and learn new makeup. It has a unique charm and is not vulgar. Ashamed to compete with peach and plum blossoms. Without a good matchmaker. What harm is there? The fairy of Miaogu originally had no groom. Her friends in the mountains are pine and bamboo. At night, there is a gentle breeze and the moon and frost. Those ordinary flowers can only listen to orders. Who can be the first to welcome the spring? Therefore, it is said that. The new moon stretches its eyebrows, and the stars shine. When the old plum opens its mouth, all the flowers are busy. Who knows it after heaven and earth grow old? They only say that the world is blind. But unexpectedly. The affectionate person is still Lin Hejing. The confidant must speak of Meng Xiang's intestines. Now, the determination of the national flower is even more glorious.</p>

<p>Opening "Lamenting the Dead"</p>
<p>The thatched cottage is desolate, beside the bamboo fence. The west wind is bleak, and the rain is drizzling. A few yellow chrysanthemums are just beginning to bloom. Touching the scenery breaks my heart with the most tragic feelings. Thinking of that. Last winter, my wife died of illness. Counting today, it has been more than half a year. During her lifetime, she loved the chrysanthemums by the fence the most. She cultivated them herself and never left them. Until now. The chrysanthemums are still there, but where is the person? Seeing the flowers, how can I not think of my late wife. Since coming to my home, she has followed the ways of a woman. Her needlework was never low. She always kept the courtyard clean. Her cooking was always delicious. When guests arrived, tea was always available. She used a lot of rue and Wuyi tea. She embroidered new patterns. She shook the cotton yarn spinning machine. She had silk and satin in her chests and boxes. She had prepared skirts and shirts for all seasons. She never dared to be greedy for sleep in the evening. She often read books on female precepts under the lamp. She saved silver to help me. She exchanged gold for treasures, and there was still more left over. She was filial to my parents. She quietly raised the children. In the hot summer, she drove away the mosquitoes with mosquito nets. When it was cool in autumn, she had to prepare winter clothes. Husband and wife lived together in harmony for many years. There was never any conflict or disagreement. Until now, the boudoir is empty, leaving only a portrait. Her soul is drifting, returning to the West.</p>

<p>My parents' endless thoughts are mixed with tears. Examining my lowly self. My children are crying. Who will wipe the tables and chairs? Dust flies in my face. I sleep alone in a lonely coat, watching the remaining drips. The makeup table is desolate, the shadow is rare. I want to remarry a virtuous and capable woman. How can I, lamentably, lack money to move. Many feelings of love are hard to cut off. The road separates yin and yang, and there is no meeting date. Clearly, the mirror is split. Good birds nest in the same forest in two places. Who can I tell my bitter situation to?</p>

<p>The Asia Sound Harmonica Society is a newly emerging harmonica music group in Shanghai. The society is entirely organized by amateur comrades, aiming to popularize harmonica music, unlike those that aim to make a profit. It has been broadcasted on major radio stations many times and has been warmly welcomed by all walks of life. Now, in order to implement its original intention, the society is publicly soliciting the first session of new free comrades, beginner and advanced class leaders. In addition to waiving all membership fees and tuition fees, it also gives away exquisite lecture notes and sheet music. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life who love the harmonica, don't miss this good opportunity. The society has scheduled to open class leaders on February 9 (Sunday). The venue is at Room 311, 3rd Floor, Dahua Building, Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road Intersection, Oriental Japanese School. The number of places is limited, so please hurry to register and request chapters.</p>
<p>The Thunder and Lightning Drama Society was scheduled to broadcast a special program at the Tongle Radio Station a few days ago.

A brochure will be sent upon request by letter.</p>

<p>The horse team departure scene in "Little Heroes" was dubbed by Ding Xiangshan. If this song were a "creation" of Li Jinhui, hearing this news in his sickbed might miraculously cure him.</p>
<p>Chen Dabe, the inventor of "Beautiful Consciousness," also plays an important role in "Chocolate Girl" this time. I specifically recommend Wang Junda to take Wang Meiyu to see it.</p>
<p>Zhao Gongbang has now decided to go to England with his wife and children. It is said that he will be a professor of Chinese.</p>
<p>Ye Juanjuan is an actress who knows how to act. After "Escape," it was rumored that Yue Feng would direct a film starring Miss Ye alone, but the Yihua authorities ultimately gave up because they thought Miss Ye was not as bankable as Yuan Yun. For the past few months, Miss Ye has been very distressed. The charms she tried have been ineffective. Recently, there have been reports of her attempting suicide. I wonder what the "Juan Society" members think?</p>
<p>"Miss Ye usually likes to eat raw chicken heads. (See Art Sea Interview Notes)"</p>
