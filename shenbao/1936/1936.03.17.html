<p>— 年</p>
<p>昨日本報所載粵桂實業考察團報吿中有粵農林局長馮銳君之談話謂廣東早稻經改良後產量可增百分之二十五夫吾國糧食之生產與銷費雖無精確之統計然觀於外米之大量進口在去年海關統計中竟占進口之最重要地位以價値言達海關金單位五千萬元則中國民食之不能自給其問題嚴重可以想見研究糧食問題諸專家亦曾大聲疾呼以促國人之猛省政洽當局且計劃糧食統制以圖補救矣惟是經緯萬端重在實際進行問題要點須能增加生產此記者之所以於獲知粵省改良成續以後倍感興味並希望稻種改良之能積極推行也</p>
<p>講先檢察各方研究稻種改良之成績以明其增加生產之可能的數字廣東既如上述其餘爲記者所知者有二　中央大學農學院曾取崑山之普通品種名大籽秈者作高級試騐四年能增加產量百分之十六　北平燕京大學作物改良試騐塲經八年試騐育成一改良稻種平均增加產量百分之三十據此以言稻種改良之結果其產量增加之可能爲自百分之十六至三十中國十足年之全國秈粳稻生產量爲八萬萬七千三百餘萬担卽使每年實際收成對此數須打折扣然改良後生產之增加其數當超過五千萬石亦大爲可觀矣</p>
<p>次就糧食恐慌最甚之粵浙兩省計算其不數之米糧數以明稻種改良後對於中國民食所給予之濟助情形粵省每年產米七千八百餘萬石據有人統計所缺的爲二千五百石之數浙省據去年民政廳發表全省產米四千三百七十餘萬石不敷的一千萬石夫量需外米之粵省其所不數之米爲生產量之百分之三十三强驟觀之不免使人驚詫惟以改良成績對照言之則不敷之百分數大可减少至浙省所虧尙低於百分之二十三更爲改良結果所能救濟故卽謂改良稻種之推行爲目前解决民食問題最重要之一着亦無不可</p>
<p>記者非不知解决民食問題於增加生產以外尙有政治的經濟的種種關係亦非謂改良稻種之推行旦夕可以收效而無視進行中之隊阻也</p>
<p>凡茲所論亦惟認稻種改良可以實際進行努力增加生產較善於空談任何計劃耳</p>

<p>柏林各報載稱、德國政府擬派外交部法理顧問戈斯、（曾於一九二五年參加羅卡諾公的之起草工作、）爲代表出席國聯會行政院會議、戈斯業已抵達倫敦云云、惟據本社訪員所知、戈斯並未離開柏林、上述消息、自屬不確、大抵德國復文中所提出之條件、如爲國聯會行政院所接受、則將由駐英大使赫許代表出席、此在政界人土以爲德國政府對於第二項條件、允爲注重、必俟各國對於元首希特勒所提出之和平建議、允予談判之後、始能派遣代表出席國聯會行政院會議、且卽使出席之後、若遇行政院討論譴責德國廢的行爲之時、德國代表、無論如何、亦决不參加云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦國聯方面對於倫敦現所發見之歐洲局勢、甚抱嚴重觀念、覺德國關於請其參加國聯行政院今日會議事之覆文、並未使事態改善、類似僵局之緊張狀態、現仍存在、故今日午後行政院開會時、英外相艾登之言論將爲人極端重視、而意國駐英大使格蘭第之言論、亦將爲人注意、因意國將第一决正式揭開其觀念與意旨之幕也、惟午後會議未必如衆料之爲公開的集會、今晨英內閣集議考慮德國覆文所造成之時局、閣員全體出席、外相艾登先與法外部人員商榷、後始出席閣議、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林法國拒絕討論元首希特勒所提另訂新的、以代凡爾賽及羅迦諾條的之建議、已令一般人相信利用國聯調解羅迦諾危機之希望、已完全打破、德國今日重申前言、謂派往萊茵河區之軍隊、僅爲一象徵的」兵力、故不能撤退、此間以爲希氏對於國聯調解、已提出最後之條件、且早經聲明、如他國不能接受、卽可取消、消息靈通之觀察者以爲希氏决不因法國之壓力、而改變其耍求、故德國雖已接受國聯之邀請、大概不致遣派代表參加行政院會議、法國拒絕希氏之第二項條件、已增加武力解决萊茵爭端之威脅矣云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦國聯會行政院正式邀請德國派員出席會議之後、德國復文已於昨晚賚到、每日電聞報頃載稱、「英國內閣方面、閱悉德國複文之後、均以爲非國聯會所能接受、且德國用意、顯欲離間英法兩國、故不僅難予接受、抑且有害大局、先是、英國駐德大使費潑斯爵士、曾就參加行政院會議問題、與德國政府有所接洽、一般人原望經此接洽之後、德國必可無條件接受行政院之邀請、而出席會議、英法比三國代表、且曾本此旨、舉行非公開談話數决、藉使彼此意見、得以互相接近、當時法國代表對於英國政府所處之地位、表示完全諒解、因而有人建議、由英國對於法比兩國安全、提供新保障、以補羅卡諾公的之不足、無如英國向德國接洽結果、德國政府在其復文中所採態度、依然堅决如故、因而上項建議、自亦不得不加以修改矣、「該報並相信、國聯會行政院、本日午後開會時、蘇·俄·意國暨小恊商各國、必對德國採取極堅决之熊度、「則以此等國家、均恐德國政府將在年內有所行動、而將捷克境內操德語之少數民族、加以吸收、因而在東歐洲方面、引起糾紛故也」云（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c82">漢粵紀行（六）　（本報記者旅行通信）　衡陽 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 趙君豪</p>
<p>粵漢鐵路凡一千零九十六公里，自粵至漢，以衡陽爲中心點，故株韶段工程局卽設於是。其地爲湘南大郡，人口稠密，市肆殷　，名勝古跡，所在多是，粵漢路全綫通車後，衡陽地位之重要，自不待言矣。</p>
<p>余等自南嶽山麓循公路乘汽車至衡陽郊外汽車站，原可於此下車，嗣以車可進城，乃開駛入城，城垣極低矮之能事，舉手可攀，汽車開入，門拱幾達車頂。城內市而極好，亦能勵行新生活，路中置有行人靠左之路牌。馬路準備放寬，兩旁拆去房屋，惟路面尙未做，聞衡陽縣府擬以糞捐作爲築路之費，一年可獲數萬金云。衡陽商業，可擬諸無錫，大商店多在湘江西岸奮城，若上海銀行，中國銀行，商務印書館等均設有分店。</p>
<p>株韶段工程局設在江東岸，余等渡湘江，不五分鐘，便達其地。上岸後，見一切建設，宛如新關之市區，有坦蕩之馬路，有林立之路燈，三叉路口，置有新式崗警亭，或圓或方，備極美觀，亭下且映放紅燈，以便行車。自江邊乘人力車前進，行的十分鐘，見一巍峨壯麗之大厦，卽爲新建之衡陽車站，此種建築，在湘南尙屬僅見，按照鐵道部計畫，原擬於衡陽建造工程局局所，嗣該局以工期短促，爲撙節經費計，似無與建之必要，緣呈准鐵部，將車站提前建築，在未通車以前，將局遷入，以利辦公。衡陽車站爲二等站，建築外表，採用單潔莊嚴之近代立體式，共分三層，計地下層，地平層，樓上層，計屋數十間，均切於實用。現衡州客車已通至郴州，每日乘客在站出入者甚衆。</p>
<p>除車站建築以外，該局又在站南廣地，關爲員司住宅區，佔地五十餘畝，建屋十六座，分爲甲種三幢，乙種四幢，丙種八幢，又公寓一幢，屋前均有廣塲，雜蒔花木，電燈自來水，亦應有儘有。住宅區曰勵志里，儼如上海之新式弄堂，惟此項住宅，一律爲平房耳。丁文江氏前在衡陽中煤毒，卽在勵志里之招待所中，衡陽酷寒，令人難受，春初尙且如此，况在隆冬耶？惟丁氏煤毒已獲救，不圖復發舊疾，竟致殞命，傷哉</p>
<p>衡嶽名勝古跡極多，有廻雁峯，爲衡嶽七十二峯之首，聞雁飛至此折回，故名。又東洲竹林，幽篁夾道，爲王船山先生講學之所，附近設有船山學校，以留紀念。此外吳三桂竄往雲南時，會先於此開對，故衡陽尙有東華門之名稱，且不無遺跡可尋，除以上所言者外，尙有石鼓山（卽石鼓書院），岳屛山，花藥寺，西湖，思杜亭，嘉樹園（卽株韶段苗圃）余等以時促，均未及往觀也。</p>
<p>衡陽不但爲粵漢路之中心點，且有公路，可通廣西，現湘省境內之公路，已築至邊界，惟廣西公路，尙未展築至此，因沿途高山極多，施工不易也。</p>
<p>株韶局員工初來衡陽時，因人數極衆，食用所需，率取之市肆，故地方上亦多得一筆收入，惟日久未免高抬物價耳。其實以該路員工如是其衆，在初來衡陽時，似可卽辦一消費合作社，庶供求可以相給，而生活亦可較爲舒適也，最近鐵道部爲督促粵漢路早日完成起見，特派督工專員三人至路督促，此三人爲周技正良欽，夏技正全綬，新路建委會聶科長肇靈。周技正年事已老，在粵漢路初期，會任測量，並於民國二十一年間，任韶州樂昌問總段工程司，深知該路歷史，夏技止亦曾騐收韶業段工程，聶科長前任浙贛路主任工程司。此三人在工程界素負聲譽，到路後迭赴各工程段視察，於路工進展，亦頗多策劃云。</p>
<p>鐵道部張部長公權，卽至粵漢路視察，連日各方均籌備招待，南段局長李仙根，廣九路局長李祿超，均將至衡陽迎候，關於整理南段及湘鄂段，聞均將於此决視察後作一通盤之計劃也。</p>

<p>— （謙善）</p>
<p>『說大話使小錢』，這是舊都一句諺語，譬如說：一吊錢—（吊簡寫干）就是當十銅圓十枚，當二十銅圓五枚。五百「錢」—或「文」就是當十銅圓五枚而已。然在山東等省，却又相反，一吊錢，就是一百枚當十銅圓了。這或是根據從前制錢而說的，我回憶十多年前在北京時有很多代制錢的小小銅鈿，計紅銅當五文的，紅銅當二文的，黃銅當一文的，質紋甚精細。那時候：一二文小銅鈿，眞可以買些葱。薑。椒。蒜作做料，五文已能備辦油。鹽。醬。醋來調味了！如此輕微小費，就說起碼的話，也覺有趣，况遇到乞丐們臨門索討時，只消一文小銅鈿，便打發走了，一天縱打發十個乞丐，代價一枚銅圓！現在想起，很覺可笑哩！</p>

<p>— 謝仲文</p>
<p>如果說倫敦是霧的都市，那麼，北平便該算是灰的都市了。恰像灰的濃重和污穢的程度一樣，我對北平的印象是深刻而鮮明的。然其中使我最難忘却的便是灰。</p>
<p>在北平，不管是出外或家居，灰到處都糾纏着我。在馬路上它飛入我的耳鼻，一入胡同，它更要俺沒我的脚背；卽使是在屋裏吧，它也會打窗縫攅進來，飄散到桌椅床舖和書籍上面去。任是高聳在北海公園裏的白塔，金碧輝煌的故宮，晶瑩澄靜的昆明湖，全得給它洒上一層輕妙的褪色劑。灰是飄到了我走過的每一個所在，灰也攅入了北平的每一個角落。</p>
<p>這古老的北國，便是這樣的充滿着灰，灰，灰。也許就是灰，這污濁的東西，使北國衰老的吧？然而伊是曾經怎樣的誘惑過遊人們的必目啊！</p>
<p>灰不但籠罩了整惆北平的輪廓，而且滲入了伊的核心，使得安息在伊懷抱的一切有生命的柬西，昏迷，麻木，懈惰！</p>
<p>我看見馱着炭筆半睜開眼踏慢步的瘦　和駱駝，我看見大車載着丈來高的稻草，稻草上面躺着打盹的趕車夫，我看見提着鳥籠早晚在太廟旁　　的閒人，我看見公寓，飯館，球房，電影院裏滿坑滿谷的趕熱鬧的學生，我看見許多失却了生命力的遊魂，我看見了北平心靈上的灰！</p>
<p>這不可拭滅的心靈上的灰是正在增加它的堆續，總有一日，它會淹沒這古老的北國吧？可咒咀的灰！</p>

<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>昨接舊雨黃君，自河北來函，詳述北平之窖，轉錄如下，以餉讀者：</p>
<p>北地嚴寒，一入冬令，卽氣候凛冽，地無靑草，農作物中之能在地過冬者，僅有麥苗一種，然其葉亦皆凍送冰脆，觸之卽斷，至於蔬類菓類，此時期內，田野間可稱全部宣吿絕踪。余旅北過冬，尙係初决，見此狀况，初頗以冬季蔬食來源斷絕爲慮。然入冬以來，庖人治餐，仍日有所進，余久亦忘之。臘底，思欲一賭北俗過舊歷年情形，特衢寒入城，（余因畏寒，入冬後，終日在室圍爐，從未入城，）則見鮮蔬鮮菜，充斥於市，小販均車載肩挑，沿街呌賣，不僅久己絕跡田野之蔬類應有盡有；甚至夏秋成熟之西瓜黃瓜葡萄柿梨等類之鮮菓，亦隨買隨有，試購啖之，覺其色香脆，初無異於摘自枝頭，採自田間，並非如劉基之柑，乾若敗絮，不禁大疑。嗣乃詰之土人，因知民間固別有久藏之法。法甚簡易：此間農民均於所居院落內，擇一隙地，掘一口徑的約三尺之阱，深至丈餘，然後再橫掘之，穴地成一土室。室之幅圓，視貯藏品之多寡而異，其大者則須上托厚板，下支木柱，以防坍陷，人之升降，內具有梯，物之出納，上縋以繩，阱口常蓋木板，不使空氣流通，其上再覆乾草，厚二三尺，其名曰「窖」，北語呼如「交」音。平時農民有所收穫，凡欲鮮藏者，採摘後卽納此中。一入冬令，則盡田間之所有，悉數採取入窖，此後隨食隨取，歷久不改其鮮嫩。倘得貯藏妥善，蔬菓之壽命，在窖內可延一年，以待新陳交接。且原來之色香甘脆，絲毫不變。此種地窖，在華北極其普運，除城市外農村幾家家都有，惟我南地是吾可以仿築，尙屬疑問。因南方土層薄而水床近，掘地易成水井，設無此顧慮，則　菓在南之聲價，必遠勝於罐頭鮮菜。因今日所謂罐菓者，表面固已科學化，非復舊法之蜜餞菓類可與比擬，若論事實，則罐菓之色香甘脆，全已失眞，且必煮熟入罐，仍與蜜餞製法相似，所不同者，外加一罐耳。故與其名之曰罐頭鮮菓，不如直稱之謂罐頭蜜餞，似較確切。果北地窖藏之法，而能推行於南方，我知窖品之價值，必駕罐品之上也。</p>

<p>李士廉伸手到懷裏去，似乎探摸着他懷裏的稿件一下，又抬起手來，搔了幾搔頭髪，這就笑着答道：與其我在程先生這裏等，又吵鬧程先生，倒不如我到自己屋子裏去等着王先生，可以暢談一會子。志前笑道：假使北海來了，我一定叫他去拜訪你。不過我有一句題目外的話奉吿。就是王北海這個人的脾氣，我是知道的，他究竟是一個靑年，耍他帮忙，就要他帮忙，只耍是在情理之中的，我想他不會拒絕。可是你千萬不可借一件什麼事去運動他，作交換條件。李士廉聽到這句話，就不由得臉皮一紅。接上還牽扯了兩下衣襟，似乎志前這一句話，正觸着了他的癢處。李士廉笑道：我的報吿是如此。不過你要作月老的話，那是你一番好意，北海接受不接受，那是另一問題，不過你不把這兩件事合攏到一處去說，我想北海决不能見怪於你的。李士廉臉上，雖不斷的現出躊躇的樣子，但是還靜靜的向下去聽志前的話。等他把話說完，這就站起來拱了兩拱手笑道：我明白了，我明白了。將來事情成功，各方面都要請程先生喝一鍾的。設完，他很高興的笑着去了。志前在屋子裏轉了一會子，就寫了一張字條，放在桌上。寫着北海兄來了，快到李士廉先生屋子裹去有事接洽。自己却半掩了房門，到前面周有容屋子裹來閑坐。他屋子裏另坐有兩位穿西服的人，只看他們那衣服，雖是深靑的，外面加上了一層不紅不黃的顏色，那正是在大陸上奔走慣了，罩上一片灰塵的肥號。周有容首先站起來笑道：我正打算去請你，你就來了，這可好極了。因介紹着那兩位說，一位是西陲旅行團長郭卓然，一位是團副成石公。郭先生是稍覺尖削的面孔，兩腮上全有短短的鬍　子，因爲那鬍樁子也帶了黃紅的顏色，彷彿那也是沾上了灰塵的。不通他那高鼻梁旁邊，兩隻閃閃有光的眼晴，却很可以代表他那冒險分精神。（四一六）</p>

<p>於是聽見公庽裏老闆呌他的小女孩磕頭，於是又放爆竹，於是遠處近處震天價地響，於是歌舞昇平。</p>
<p>於是院中靜靜了，於是夢之女神於我碰跳的胸前覆以黑紗。</p>
<p>於是鼓吹休明。（按「鼓吹休明」爲兒時於故鄉寺廟中之戲臺上普通所見的正中金字底匾額。</p>

<p>— 孔皆</p>
<p>在各種考試中除筆試外常列有面試一項，視之似無甚重要，然亦不可忽視，近聞友人所談三事允足以證實之：</p>
<p>有某公司擬招考練習生三人，一時報名者甚衆，然筆試及格者僅八人，於是公司的此八人於决晨面試，及時八人均往，但經理並不出見，祇每人給以餛飩一碗。迨召見時只問以：「汝食餛飩幾枚」一語，只三人能答出，於是祗此三人被錄取。</p>
<p>又某廠招考管事者數人，逮筆試畢，逐一召試及格者，使各受試者經一狹長之甬道以達面試之處，而於路上置一帝及一簸箕，各受試者皆跨過之，只一人扶之起而置之牆角，以此人能管閒事，心細之故，合管事之位，遂被錄取。</p>
<p>有某女士者應一打字員之面試，女士平日衣着固甚樸素，是日特盛裝以往，然竟以是主試者恐其不能安於薪金微小之事，而致落選，事爲一同受試而才不如女士者所得。</p>
<h3 id="c152">五色的北平 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 羅曼</p>
<p>北平，是政治區，是文化城，是一個古勝遺跡的陳列所，是一個罪惡混雜的染色缸。</p>
<p>紅的染在女人的唇上，鮮鮮的像是滴過血的漏斗，狐狸似的被裝在男人的手臂上，男人便像是提著一枝手杖似的在衝上優遊著。在斜陽燈影裏的衛頭，在人羣擁擠的市傷，這紅紅的顏色是格外分明的，只要是棱子似的眼睛來回織一織，於是在一聲媚笑裏，這紅紅的顏色，便像是出賣着肉體和靈魂的標幟。</p>
<p>黃的染在各條巷子裏的各家門邊的墻下。在太陽惺忪着眼疲倦了的時候，各個墻根下便閃出了各色各樣的男女孩子們，蓬蓬的髮，垢汗的臉，蹲在那兒使勁的排泄着這黃色的染料。有時拖了鼻涕的手，拿着一條樹枝在玩弄着自己的製造品。玩得厭了的時候，便隔着街道互相叫罵起來。小順子罵王妮的媽媽跟王癩子睡覺，王妮罵着阿狗的姐姐在街上跟男人一塊走。於是在一聲的嘈雜裏，各人互罵着對方的媽媽，直到滿街上染了一片微弱的燈光時，各人的媽媽才出來罵着自己孩子的媽媽走進去。於是街上便整個的陳列的兩行黃黃的東西，替這古城做了一件珍貴的裝飾品，突然，兩條狗又汪的一聲打起架來。</p>
<p>籃的染的街心裏警察的小棍上。輕輕的一舉，嗚的一聲，一輛汽車裝着幾塊艷肉飛過去；這藍色的小棒一舉，又是幾塊艷肉飛過去，汽車像是沒有這種裝飾品便掃興似的，老是妖精似的女人在車裏笑。不過，籃色棍舉起來而沒有汽車駛過的時候也有，但是，這棍使偏落在洋車夫的腦袋上，於是洋車夫便不能不承認這條小棍爲他們的權威者。</p>
<p>白的塗在年靑人們的臉片上，時代的都市姑娘和少爺們在十一點起來後，洗過臉一定先拿着蝶霜，厚厚的擦在臉片上；甚麼粉，甚麼水，總是檢着巴黎的牌子；在自己的心靈上，的確也在咬着這臉上白白的東西而過着浪漫的生活。雖然人人都說擦得太白像妖精，但是五毛一磅的雪花膏，仍然是很有號召的力量，窮的姑娘，誰不站在商店的窗子前出出神？</p>
<p>黑的染在煤夫的臉上手上和鼻孔裏心尖上。他們就像是命裏注定的黑模樣，印度阿三似的移動着，老是那麼遲鈍得像沒有人的感覺。在早上，天還很黑的時候，就得縮着黑頭黑手爬起來，黑的煤塊，裝在黑的車子上，凍硬了的手僵硬的握着鞭子在喘着粗氣的牲口上抽一下，又是垂下頭去打嗑睡，車子便悠然的在塵土濛濛的路上爬動着。他們沒有靑春，沒有人生，生活只是那麼死板板的犧牲在這黑黑的顫色裏。</p>
<p>——這北平，喏大的一個染色缸，也染着各種罪惡的色彩，象徵着各種生活的實質，只要你是有心人，包你在這些顏色上，看得出北平的本色和眞面目。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>等到一曲旣終，乃德鞠躬將退，別人那肯放他？手拍得不停，使他不得不重來一回。他重來一回時臉上帶着快樂的容色，別人看了，也覺得愉快，因爲他盡心去做，給他們以歡暢的老曲調，遂使足也聞而起舞，大家已一動而不能復靜了。</p>
<p>『甲板上快快弄淸楚』，愛彌喊道：不到一分鐘，椅子統已推到後面，老年人安置在角落裏，孩子們齊集在台上。</p>
<p>『要有禮貌』！愛彌又喊道：於是童子們都各騰躍到婦女那邊去，不管年輕的與年老的，彬彬地請她們伴舞。小童子們爲欲爭搶那金鬈兒，幾乎要用武，但是她以惻隱同情之心選擇了迪克，讓他得意揚揚領她過去。蜀去人也不許不加入：艾美姨丈給唐恩以不可名狀的暢快，因爲她竟辭了拂朗而願和他作伴。自然南恩和韜摩，乃德和小梅各自成對，同時坦第姨丈却去邀了亞西，她本有躍躍欲試之心，現在騾然得心這樣的光榮，更覺受寵若驚。賴司務與安曼麗獨自在門街空裏跳舞，在半惆鐘頭裏梅莊眞是歡樂極了。</p>

<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>護士事業在今日，爲一種近代崛起新興的職業，歐美先進諸邦，無不公認護士事業，是一種保衛民族體魄的健康，服務社會基本的職業，與國家的强弱及社會的進化，有着深密之關鍵，在整個社會集團裏，佔着很重大實際需要，因此護士職業的推動，護士敎育的發達，趨於一日千里之形勢，</p>
<p>再回顧我國護士界的情况，已具有五十餘年的歷史，何以政府當局和社會人士，對於護士事業，還不能知道它的工作之重要性，護士職業存在之必然性哩？再更進一步的講，與我護士職業有密切關係情如手足的醫藥界，能正確深刻認識護士事業眞意義者，恐怕也微乎其渺吧。那末，護土職業在他國社會集團裏，能認爲是重要，而在同一國家的中國社會環境內，爲何瞠落後人哩，這誠是當前護士界最迫切需要研究的中心問題，因此我們更不能不大量去思維，觀察一下，究竟今日之中國護士界的情形是怎樣，以作爲明日推動護士事業基本之參證　　甲　護士事業一般觀察的狀况</p>
<p>（一）護士學校行政不能獨立中國護士事業的落後，推臆它的原因，當然是很多複雜的問題，但是護士學校本身之不能獨立，組織不健全，行政主權受着醫院當局的控制，實爲中國護士事業不能發達不能進展最重要的癥結，關於一個學校經費的預算，敎授人才的選擇，課程敎材的編製，圖書儀具以及種種之設備，整個是要建築在堅因的學校行政組織上面，無疑的，誰士學校行政主權之獨立問題，實是控扼護士事業成敗興衰的中樞機關，可是中國所設立的護士學校，在數量上確也不能算少，儼然已樹立起學校獨立的旗幟，在實際上面，學校行政的主權，整個爲醫院方面所操縱，所把持，所支配了。旣然學校行政爲院方管而轄之，行而使之，又爲何需要這傀儡式的學校有存在的價值哩，這無非是想藉着學校名義去號召，迷惑社會的耳目，以招收男女學生，而作醫院內最經濟基本之勞工，所以與其說是學校本身的存在，莫如說是醫院徵集勞工的行政機關，更覺來得清心悅耳吧。</p>
<p>（二）護士敎育的沒落　學校行政旣然是不能獨立，學校一切的設施，當然是均吿缺乏，巳很顯著昭示我們，根本上就不能談到護士敎育之可能，確立護士敎育中心的目標，奠定敎學的方針，不能不算護士敎育已走至沒落的路途，是一天一天呈露深刻尖銳起來，旣然是招收學生整個之目的不是在造就人才而設，適合社會之需要而產生，是在節省醫院經濟爲前題，在「敎」的方面，所得到護士的學力，護病的技能，祇能顧及目前醫院的需要爲範圍，而不能顧慮將來適應社會爲條件，在「育」的方面，並不以學生心理的需要，精神的狀態作「育」之標準，反而訂立嚴厲之條規，的法之三章，使學生整天終日過着無組織無系統學徒式的生活，在敎旣不得育又不能的護士教育現狀下，可算已至窮送末路護士敎育沒落的期間了。（未完）</p>

<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十八—</p>
<p>某日，一個白髮老翁投到醫院中來。他病得很利害，一進醫院，就給施手術。二星期後，施行第二次手術。麻醉藥剛給施用，那老翁卽停止呼吸，心臟也停止活動了。人工呼吸不能挽回他的生命。於是外科醫生决定施行最後的方治。他們預備一種液體，這裏面含有千分之一的Epinephrine。那老翁虛脫後已五分鐘，這液體給注入他的左心室中。效騐非常迅速。在三十杪鐘內，那老翁開始呼吸了，他的心臟也重又跳動。</p>
<p>從這以後，這樣的奇踐已變成常事。藉這方法而得挽回生命的，不計其數。有的是在給施行手術時虛脫的，有的是產後卽死的嬰兒，有的是受電震而死的。目前，此項方法已被實際應用於各醫院中</p>
<p>某日，在地脫里奧地方，一盜給警察格殺。他顯然已絕了氣，給送到醫院中去。給施用腎上腺素注射後，他便淸醒過來，雖然時間很短，但已足够使他供出他的同夥的名字</p>
<p>可是，在無論那一例子，沒有醫生能斷定死後重生的人是確實「死」過的。這沒有什麼奇怪，因爲誰也不能斷定在什麼時侯人體確實死去。所謂「突死」的事，好像是沒有的</p>
<p>有時也有人假定，生命的結束是驟然的，正和扭上開關打斷電流相同。實際上，「死」的法則是緩慢的，逐漸的，和巨大的帝國的崩潰相彷。腦和心臟，好比帝國的首都，首先死亡。其他身體部分的細胞，好比帝國的殖民地，都不是立卽絕滅的，却等待最後的崩潰。沒有滋養料從首都發送，沒有援兵到來帮助殺「敵」—傷害的化學變化及微菌之類，牠們纔終於死亡。</p>
<p>所以，要斷令「生」與「死」的接替的瞬間是很難的。通常的試騐，因爲並不包含「割開血管」這一種手續，不是完全可靠的。呼吸的斷絕和心臟跳動的停止，雖然常與「死」相伴，有時却不能算爲「已死」的證據。</p>
<p>「假死」的事，是常有的。新近，在倫敦公園中，有人看到一童子在地上，身體泳冷，脈息全無，顯然是已死了。給送到醫院中後，醫生亦證明他已死，簽發一張死亡體書。把屍體抬到墓地，正待動手埋葬，童子的母親趧到了。她聽到別人說他的兒子已死，堅决吾認；她提出以前醫生對她的見子簽發的三張死亡證書來，衆人纔驚異地等侯。過了一回，那童子果然淸醒過來，跟他的母親走回家中。</p>
<p>卽使是完全健康的人，有時也能裝死的。在印度拉賀耳地方某展覽會中，有過一决活人裝死的事。名呌哈羅達斯（Harodas）的托鉢僧自動昏厥。衆人把他盛入袋中放在木箱裏面，埋在離地面丈許的士中。地上有哨兵防衛，顯然私弊和詭計是沒有的。過四十天，掘開泥土，把僧人的屍體攆到空氣中。不多久，他居然坐起來討食喫了。</p>
<p>「眞死」的斷定旣如此困難，康納西博士所致力的「起死回生」是吾眞正可以實現當然遺是一個疑問。可是，賴醫學的進步，人類的「枉死」和「早期埋葬」等死運至少是可以給免除的吧。</p>
<h3 id="c195">肺癆統計之世界觀（一） <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>吾人欲防遏一種疾病之發生，不僅對於其原因方面須加研究，卽該病消張之狀况，變遷之歷史，人文地理之關係，亦須注意及之，是則疾病之統計尙矣。此統計之學，近代巳成爲任一科學研究上一種必需要之工具。在英國已視爲公共衛生上最重要之一科。如Wolff氏證明結該之死亡例，在歐洲各國之工業區中，以其衛生設施之逐漸改良，結核之死亡例亦因之逐漸减少。Wolff氏同時又證明結核死亡例及癌症死亡例與住宅之關係，發現結核死亡例與居住之密度有直接的關係，而在癌症死亡例則吾。</p>
<p>以德國之結核死亡統計而言，自一九二四年起（一九二四年爲德國全境徵收疾病死亡統計之年）至一九三二年爲止，有顯明之變連如下：</p>
<p>在每一萬居民中因結核而死亡者</p>
<p>一九二四年　十二，〇　　一九二五年　十〇，七</p>
<p>一九二六年　九，八</p>
<p>一九二七年　九，三</p>
<p>一九二八年　八，八</p>
<p>一九二九年　八，七　　一九三〇年　七，九</p>
<p>一九三一年　七，九</p>
<p>一九三二年　七，五</p>
<p>由以上之統計而觀，每一萬居民中之死亡數，由十二例遞减至七，五例，此種成績，可知其歷年來防癆之努力。在一九三〇年，其死亡例之遞减，有一小小停頓。據Flatzeck　Holbauer氏之意見，此種遞减之停頓，乃由於文化的衛生的關係，而更重要者，乃屬於經濟的關係。弗氏以爲患病者多屬於貧民階級，但因衛生設施改善之後，結核之死亡例亦卽减少</p>
<p>弗氏以爲結核死亡例之减少，約有二種之觀察及時期。第一時期爲一八八五年至一九二五年，在此時期內，爲結核死亡例眞正之减少。自一九二五年起，爲第二時期，共死亡例减少之原因，乃由於核治療之進步，及防癆工作發展之所致。</p>
<p>又Goldstein氏之統計意見，謂由公共衛生的立塲而論，結核死亡例之减少，極與職業及營養問題有關，而與居住之問題則關係較少，其决則公共診療所及保險機關之組織等，均與結核死亡例之减少，有直接原因。</p>
<p>據Jckert民之研究，認爲現時德國因公共保備之組織及公共衛生之進展，關於人民之營養方面，已無大問題。卽使有營養不足者，單獨亦不致與結核死亡例發生影響。惟營養不足，若與其他諸項問題，如診療所及防癆工作，工作條例，住居程度，工業區域等等，同時發生影響，則與結核死亡例有關係矣。</p>
<p>Hofbauer氏以爲貧窮者，每與結核症之發生，有相當之連帶關係。</p>
<p>Neumann氏以爲德國及奧國結核死亡例之减少，乃屬於假象的，並非眞正的减少，觀其歷年來之遞减情形，每年低减若干，幾若有一定之規則，何以如此之有程序，令人不無疑問。此種死亡例之逐漸减少現象，或由於在世界大戰及饑餓狀况之後，結核症初則因之而增加，而又漸漸减少者。但在一九二一年，德國結核之死亡例，已與戰前相同，無論如何，結核傳染之危險性已較前大减，故死亡例亦行减少。</p>
<p>結核死亡例之减少原因，以Ascher氏之研究，以爲此乃人民工作時間之减</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>少，增加機械能力，而人類體力得以保養之所致。此外有直接關係者，爲工作與休息須有定時，人體因是而增高其抵抗力。</p>
<p>又Wolff及Gundel氏之意見，以爲結核死亡例减少之原因，一方由於公共衛生，一方乃由於遺傳的關係，及醫生治療之進展。在文明各國，供巳有相當之成績。但德國年來社會之經濟情形，並不十分良好，而結核死亡例，反較之他國更爲减少，自必有特殊之原因，而由於「公共衛生保險之嚴密組織一之所致，實屬無可疑者也。因其他各國，均無如此之衛生保險組織方法。試觀Geissler氏年來之研究，發現結核之死亡例，在工作之職員較低，在自由職業或領袖職業之人，其死亡例反而較高，殊足令人注意。</p>
<p>試以德國各地之結核死亡例而觀，則稍有不伺之點，其最低者爲海森地方Hessen，以每一萬人計算，中有五，一一因肺結核而死亡，撒克生地方Sochsen爲五，七，白特地方Baden爲六，〇，排榮地方Bayern爲六，四，普羅士地方Preussen爲六，四六之死亡例。按海森地方，為農業區，而撒克生地方，則為工業區，居民較密者。</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>第三節成人的口腔衛生</p>
<p>（第一一七問）尋常人的刷牙，爲什麼多不合法？</p>
<p>答　刷牙的主要目的，在淸潔口腔，掃除食屑，尋常人多向左右掃刷，這樣刷法，毛頭不易達到牙縫凸處，藏在那裏的食物，就不能盡量刷去，而且若是牙刷粗硬時，橫刷易使牙頸部牙肉邊緣退縮，牙根露出部分，因爲質較軟嫩，久受磨擦，蝕成小槽，反爲患害。</p>
<p>（第一一八問）合理的刷牙方法，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答　應該上下縱刷，就是把牙刷跟着牙縫方向，上腔牙齒向下刷，下腔牙齒向上刷，這樣就容易把牙縫裏嵌着的食物刷出，然後再橫刷數决，以除未去之屑，還有一個方法，也可應用，就是刷時成圓形轉動，這時候口不要張得大開，上下腔牙齒同時刷到，這個法子縱橫兩方面都有，刷時也很順手，以上兩個方法可擇一行之。</p>
<p>（第一一九問）刷牙時還有幾點應該注意的？</p>
<p>答　還有下列三點</p>
<p>（一）牙齒的裹側，就是靠近舌部那側，也須洗刷，刷時如縱刷不便，可用橫刷。（二）臼牙的咬合面，因爲易於生蛀，應該多刷以去食屑。（三）上下腔頂裏邊的盡頭牙，也須刷到。</p>
<p>（第一二〇問）　除了牙齒外，還有什麼部分，應該刷的？</p>
<p>答　刷牙的第二個目的，就是磨練牙肉，使牠堅强，所以刷牙時，裏側和外側的牙肉，無論橫刷縱刷都應該刷到的，又舌面也須輕輕的洗刷歡决，在早晨爲除積穢起見，尤不可少。</p>
<p>（第一二一問）每日應該刷牙幾决？</p>
<p>答　早晨及每餐後一决，每日總共四决，晚飯後一决爲最要緊，因爲食物在口內，晚問睡時較日時易於發酵變酸，所以睡前應該格外多刷，又每餐後應該立刻刷牙，晚餐刷牙後，如果再吃食物，應該再行刷牙一次。</p>
<p>（第一二二問）　牙刷應該選擇怎樣的？</p>
<p>答　牙刷不可用直的，因爲我們的牙齒，排成馬蹄釘式的彎曲，所以牙刷的面，也應該彎曲，刷時才能便利服貼。牙刷的毛頭，不可太硬，也不可太軟，太硬易損牙肉，常致出血；太軟則污物不能刷去。牙刷中間的毛束，應該成犬牙的參差，不可齊平如切，而且應該排列得疏不可太密，太密則水份不易乾，微菌就易繁殖。現在市上有牙刷面如半月形的凹入和凸出的兩種牙刷發售，凹的用來刷牙齒外側，凸的刷牙齒裏側，應該買兩種同時應用，刷時較爲便利有益。</p>

<p>（八十一）實扶的里（白喉）菌性結膜炎</p>
<p>實扶的里俗名白喉。發於咽頭及喉頭最多。發於鼻腔較少。這三種實扶的里的病狀。早已在本列發表過。現在所述的。是發於眼結膜的一種實扶的里。這種結膜炎常由實扶的里菌傳染而續發。牠的主要症候。就是起初眼臉卽來發赤腫脹。繼則於眼臉結膜面。發生灰白色的僞膜。僞膜是由眼分泌物中所含有的纖維素。凝固而成。呈一種污穢灰白色。牠的硬度狠硬。又不容易剝離。如果强使剝離。卽能出血。這是一般實扶的里僞膜的特徵。僞膜如若一旦深侵結膜組織。則能壓迫血管。而使組織陷於壞疽。已成壞疽可結膜組織。常可與偽膜一同脫落而生潰瘍。所以本病治愈後。結瞙面往往貽有瘢痕。</p>
<p>實扶的里菌性結膜炎的合併症。常爲角膜潰瘍與角膜穿孔。允以在合併連鎖狀球菌的時候。容易發生這種合併症。結膜炎的炎症症狀。亦更劇烈。所以牠的預後。大都不良。</p>
<p>本病須與其他僞膜性結膜炎互相區別。因爲由連鎖狀球菌，葡萄狀球菌，肺炎雙球菌，及淋菌等等所式起的結膜炎。有時在眼臉結膜面上。亦可發生灰白色的偽膜。此時若用細菌檢查。當可不難鑑別。</p>
<p>本病若已確實診斷體明。應卽早期注射大量實扶的里血淸。常奏特效。同時醫治病眼。如若病眼祗限一側。此時卽當使用保護眼罩。保護他側健眼。以防傳染。是爲至要。</p>

<p>— 李汶</p>
<p>德元首希特勒在其國卡爾斯盧對人民發表關於出兵萊茵河區域事件之演說，有云：「現今十二吋砲彈一顆值三千馬克，如再加一千五百馬克，余可建造一間工人住宅。如放一百萬此項砲彈，毫無所益，但其價值可建築無數工人住宅」云云。這是希特勒的「和平」演說。他很得意的對世界宣稱：「今日之德國實爲世界上最『和平』之國家」。我國古有指鹿爲馬之事，希氏口中之所謂「和平」，大概正與此相類。</p>
<p>可是希氏所說一顆十二吋砲彈再加一千五百馬克，可建造一間工人住宅，這話却很有意思。分析世界各國所以必須具有極强大的軍備，不惜耗費每」國的財源之半，來建造可怕的種種充量殘酷的殺人利器，這理由却是爲了什麼？一方面，我們却看到世界各國，有成千成萬的飢餓羣衆，聲嘶力竭，血淚交迸，宛轉被壓迫於飢寒凍餒之下，連僅僅的「活命」的權利，也不能維持。這又是爲了什麼？假使將全世界各國現所有的軍備，將其建造此項巨大軍備的金錢，分布開來，則全世界將變成怎樣一個樣子？現在世界各國的軍費支出，常占其國總支出的百分之三十乃至四十以上（如日本）。建造一架飛機，需幾萬元，建造一隻軍艦，需幾百萬元乃至幾千萬元。製造一顆十二吋的砲彈需三千馬克，這還是極小極小的耗費。然而一方面，各國的財政，却在不斷宣吿「赤」字的增加，人民捐稅，儘量加重，設有極些微的「工人保險金」的若干國家，此項保險金，最後也概被取消或更减少。人類勞動的自的，原是在求生活之向上，更舒適，而現在則盡全世界之力，來做滅絕人類的工作。這是人類歷史正常的道路嗎？還是整個世界走入了錯路？</p>
<p>希特勒氏口中很漂亮的說，製造一顆十二吋砲彈需費三千馬克，再加一千五百馬克，「余可建造一間工人住宅」。可是他自己所實做的事業，却正是盡瘁在製造十二吋砲彈。</p>

<p>— 陳跡</p>
<p>傍晚，滿洲里是象死去了那麼地，沉寂在荒凉中，只有狗亂吠，奔跑，稍覺到有一點兒生氣。——然而，這是多麼悲凉的生氣呵！</p>
<p>兩個被人稱爲「鬼子兵」的，肩並着肩地，踏着淩亂的步武，切切喳喳地，談着連自己也莫明其妙地一些什麼話。他們對着滿是荒凉的前邊眺着，凌亂地走着。</p>
<p>「看哪！那邊是我們的祖國了呵」！一個高一點的用手點着遙遠的前面。</p>
<p>比較矮小一點的，用着沉默的憂慮點一點頭，表示他的懇切的回答。</p>
<p>於是大家又是亂七八糟地扯談着。忽然，那個矮小的歎了一口氣，說了：</p>
<p>「不要思戀着我們的家了吧」！</p>
<p>沉默。滿洲里的傍晚的風吹在人臉上，是冷得全身都象掉在泳窖中。然而這兩個兵士似乎是一點也不覺地，只漠然地無目的地向着前面走着。</p>
<p>他們走進一個莊子，滿目是頹牆倒垣，一種悽凉的悲戚也沁進了這兩個兵士的心中了。他們相互地看望了一眼，於是，脚步趦趄起來了。</p>
<p>正在這當兒，忽然在他們的眼前，象幽靈似地，一個小動物溜過他們的眼前，大概這小動物是嚇慌了吧，她却跑向這兩個兵士的跟前來，那個高一點兒的就把她抱了起來，孩子是哭呌了起來了；</p>
<p>「媽——媽——呵」！</p>
<p>「不要哭！不……」說着勉强的那地方的土話。他看着她的小臉蛋兒「啊！……你看」！扭過頭來對那個比較矮一點兒的。他不覺把她抱緊着，深深地吻着她的小臉蛋兒。</p>
<p>孩子哭呌起來了，那麼大聲地。</p>
<p>可是他用着悽顫的聲調向她說：「不，不，不要哭！小妹妹！你爸爸呢？一你媽媽呢」？</p>
<p>小女孩兒用着恐懼的眼光向他瞧了一眼，見他並沒有什麼惡意，她就顫顫地回答道：「爸爸媽媽都被你們打死啊！」</p>
<p>聽了這話，那兩個兵士象受了天雷的一擊似地，全身都震了一下。他們又相互地望了一眼。這時只聽見一片象扯破紙的聲音哭呌着出來：「還我孫女呀！還我——」一個老太婆哭到他們的面前：「你們殺了我的孩子，我的媳婦，我的，……難道你們還要殺我這　孩子一了嗎？……」老太婆說不下去了，只是號哭着。</p>
<p>他們把那小女孩兒還給了老太婆，就忽忽地去了。</p>
<p>第二天的傍晚，這里是又出現了這兩個兵士。他們手中各提着幾包東西，他們摸到了那小女孩兒的家中。那個長一點的把孩子抱在手中，把幾包東西放在孩子的眼前：「吃！吃！吃呵」！年老的祖母把那幾包東西搶了去：「吃不得！吃不得的呵！有，有毒的……」</p>
<p>整個的心兒都被刺痛了，這兩個兵士，象受着重傷的野獸似地，退出了這家人家。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>可是明天，他們又來了。……這樣，他們總有一個月天天不斷地到這里來。現在，那閏女孩兒不見他們怕了，並且還呌他們伯伯，年老的祖母，也非常客氣地欵待他們，他並不用懷疑的眼光來接待他們了，這兩個兵士似乎也覺到非常的快樂。</p>
<p>可是在有一天的晚上，約模夜半十二點鐘吧，這里附近驟然地起了槍聲，這密如聯珠的可怕的聲音繼續到有三小時之久，才始吿平息。</p>
<p>明天早晨，大家相走奔吿：「昨天義勇軍來的呀」！「可是被打敗了」！人們都太息，人們都憤恨。……</p>
<p>這天傍晚，那個矮一點的兵士只獨個見地走到了這個小女兒的家里來。他的臉色全是灰白的，他提了一袋糖菓來，老祖母非常驚訝，問：「還有一個呢？」</p>
<p>「昨天夜里打死了」！</p>
<p>全個房間里充滿了死的沉寂。可是還是那個年老的祖母先說：「我要問了，你們爲什麼要時常拿東西來給我們吃呢？你們待別人是非常兇惡的」！</p>
<p>「唉：你們這孩子，太象我朋友的孩子了。我們背離鄉井，有幾個年頭了，然而家里的老婆孩子，什麼都未曾睢見過一眼。所以我那朋友見了你們的孩子，因爲非常肯象，所以歡迎得了不得，天天要到你們這里來。——可是，可是現在他是死了！唉！他的孩子該怎末辦呵……」</p>
<p>「誰呌你們來打我們的」！老祖母的憤語。</p>
<p>這個矮一點的兵士在一陣的沉默中，悽然地溜走了！</p>

<p>日影由窗口移到楊樹頂上，漸漸地，又幽靈似的隱没下去。於是，蒼茫的暮靄，就流水樣地把白天的光明溶和了</p>
<p>院子是悄然的。而且，有點荒蕪的調子——碎磚砌成的小徑旁邊，蔓延着凌亂的雜草，野藤，瓜葛，和一些類似的蔓生植物。墻脚下，有幾朶不知名的紫色小花，沈垂着腦袋。那楊樹的憔悴的愁臉却釘住它們。去樹脚不遠，有堆占了一大片地方的亂草，一隻小白花貓從那里爬了出來。踱到屋門口的凉棚下面，抖擻了一下身體，那金黄的帶點迷惘的眼珠子，便疑惑地向四邊溜着。</p>
<p>這里有過一個時候是很熱閙過的，是夏天吧，每逢傍晚或夜間，這里都坐了人，談着它——小花貓——所不懂的，而在意識之内所能體會到得的事。</p>
<p>也許就是這樣的。</p>
<p>年靑的人們時常笑着，跳着，高聲地談着年靑人的韻蹟：中年入閒來就講講家常事和人情世故：老人家，永遠是太息來當自己的慰藉，到是因爲過往的時日里邊有着太多的美好的夢啊。……</p>
<p>後來，不知怎樣，人冷落了。有些也只不過躲在家里。</p>
<p>由暖和而轉向微寒的輕風溜過身邊時，它剛想起來去問問訊，而那狡猾的風兒却搖搖腦袋，就走了。</p>
<p>那天，是一個秋天的明媚的日子，它感覺興奮了。但，可沒有看見人們，人呢？</p>
<p>下午，太陽漸漸偏西。</p>
<p>有一個小姑娘，在院里摘了一大籃子野花。它想，花是聰明的。便走去問花。可是，失望了。——別的花朶不是上帝把它們帶上了天堂，就都掛着憔悴的欲哭的苦臉兒。只有那些黃色的瓣兒細細的小花，却盛開着。然而，看見那些花的驕傲和不理旁的事情的神態，它却步了。</p>
<p>想去問問草儿，而小草那种畏缩的頹萎的姿容，更是使它感到凄然地憂傷着。</p>
<p>——為什么這樣冷寂啊！</p>
<p>沒有解答，沒有回話。怪懊惱的…</p>
<p>一陣歸巢的老鴉子，拖曳着憂然的是鳴，打天空上掠過。靜穆的暮靄里邊，浮漾起動蕩的聲響。</p>
<p>悠悠地——微弱下去：又靜靜的消失了。</p>
<p>黃昏的院子，像疲倦得要死去的樣子似的。</p>
<p>直至黃昏把灰惘的眼珠子閉起，而走進到沈睡的境域時，屋里面纔有一些薄明的燈光透出窗子。</p>
<p>燈光輕撫着楊樹脚下的小草兒那蒼白的織體。這樣，老楊樹却太息了起來</p>
<p>——爲什麼不也照照我的憔悴的老臉呢！</p>
<p>許是是厭膩了吧，那隻小白花貓又爬進那草堆里去了。</p>
<p>院子始終是悄然的。……</p>

<p>老畫家劉叔康帶領了四個學生到蘇州來寫生，住在蘇州飯店裹，那天上午師生們到虎邱去暢游，在下午的時候男學生用乙丙丁和女學生楊小鳳在房裹談笑着說大家預備到街上去玩玩喝茶，看蘇州的女人，眞在談得大家起勁預備要走的時候，老畫家忽然無聲無消的跑進了這房間，他看到學生們專愛胡鬧，沒有一個用功盡畫，馬上就說出許多嚴肅的敎訓話，可是這幾個男女學生一個都不願意聽他的理論而一個一個都溜跑了！等到他發現自己面前在聽講美術理論的是一個也沒有了！他不覺得感概地說出「看蘇州女人」總比聽一惆老頭兒講討厭的理論好得多呢？</p>
<p>忽然女生小鳳又會回了轉來，問了原因，方才知道她因爲上午穿了高跟鞋爬山打痛了脚，所以不去了！</p>
<p>此時老畫家對于學生的希望心又活躍起來，他很希望小鳳能够好好的學畫，使得他的美術能有遺傳下來。聰明的小鳳看出了老畫家的意思，就認了老畫家爲爸爸，因為小鳳的父母早已完全死了！</p>
<p>當時老畫家眞是快樂得跳起來，二人從師生變成了父女，老畫家就吿訴小鳳他從前亦有一個可愛的女兒，在一决軍閥內戰時候失掉的，要使現在還在的時候巳經十八歲了！從小就很聰明，記得小時候敎她四句唐詩：「淡淡長流水，悠悠遠客情，落花雖有恨，墜地亦無聲，」她一學就會每天放在嘴上當歌唱呢？正在談得起勁的時候，忽然會跑進一個賣花的少女把他們的談話打斷了！老畫家覺得討厭要把她趕出去？</p>
<p>可是當那賣花少女臨走的時候，她的嘴裏從蘇州土語轉變成念出了四句北平語言的唐詩：「淡淡長流水，悠悠遠客情，落花雖有恨，墜地亦無聲。」老畫家聽到這四句唐詩，忽有所觸的把她叫回來，問她是北平人？什麼會念這四句唐詩。誰敎你的？賞花女就吿訴老畫家聽：「她從前有一個畫家的父親和可愛的母親，她們住在北平郊外，那一年兩個軍閥因爲爭地盤而內戰，因此她們美好的家庭給大兵燒掉了，父親據說被大兵燒死在家裏，她和母親在北平不能過活，凑巧有一個姓唐的同鄉蘇州去找母親的姊姊，可是不幸的人總是不幸的，母親的姊姊巳經死了！當然還是沒有辦法生活，幸虧由那姓唐的帮助，總算又過了幾個月，後來那姓唐要她母親嫁給他，認可以給孩子念書受敎育，母親因為要成全孩子的將來幸福，便犧牲了自己嫁給那姓唐的，起先姓唐的待他們母女眞好，後來那姓唐的因爲她母親不能生養男孩子，又討了一個姨太太，就把她們母女都丟了母親爲受到欺騙對不住丈夫就氣得病死了，她現在是一個孤單的女孩子，每天靠自己賣花賺來的錢來養活自己。」老畫家聽到這裏巳完全知道這賣花的女孩子就是自已失掉的女兒呢？</p>
<p>等到老畫家吿訴她你的爸爸並沒有給大兵燒死，我就是你的爸爸，父女二人就抱頭大哭，女兒還吿訴爸爸說母親在臨死的時還念着爸爸的各字說對不住你呢？此時小鳳亦知道那賣花的女孩子就是她的妹妹。</p>

<p>Nanjing. A certain newspaper in Shanghai has been reporting for several days that the so-called autonomy movement is occurring in southern Fujian. The descriptions are extremely detailed, giving the impression that a storm is about to break. To clarify the truth, the reporter specifically sought accurate information from a responsible source. The so-called "autonomy" in southern Fujian is entirely unfounded. Not only are the Japanese in Fujian not currently instigating such a movement, but the Japanese authorities in Fujian have also explicitly stated that if our side discovers Japanese or Taiwanese people plotting to disrupt the peace and security of Fujian Province, they are willing to assist in the crackdown and arrests.

Chairman Lin Sen gave an impromptu speech, elaborating on the Premier's teaching that "Revolution must first transform the heart." He stated that "transforming the heart" means eradicating all negative thoughts and habits, especially the clear separation of public and private matters. Comrades who do not eradicate negative thoughts are not worthy of revolutionary work. The Premier devoted his life to revolution, seeking freedom and equality for China with a selfless spirit. Therefore, the Premier quoted the saying "When the Great Way prevails, all under heaven is for the people," and demonstrated the importance of "transforming the heart" through the theory of sincere intention, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven. He hoped that all comrades would adhere to this teaching, first eradicate negative thoughts, think only of the public, seek the interests of the nation, and be role models for the people. Only then would they be worthy followers of the Premier. Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also spoke, adding to the discussion on "revolution must first transform the heart," and encouraged all working comrades to strictly adhere to discipline and order, and to serve the country and society at all times. The meeting concluded at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave an impromptu report on children's issues. The meeting concluded at 10:30 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Lin Sen gave a report at the Central Memorial Week on the morning of the 16th entitled "Revolution Must First Transform the Heart," stating that "Revolution must first transform the heart" is something that the Premier repeatedly taught us in the past. After accepting this teaching, we all understand that the meaning of the Premier's teaching is very important and the attitude is very kind, because the Premier taught us that revolution must first transform the heart. Therefore, in our revolution, on the one hand, we want to eradicate the bad society, and on the other hand, we want to build a good society. The work is very important and the cause is very great. People are born good, but because of the various social environmental factors, the heart of a child is gradually worn away. Many universities talk about rectifying the heart, making intentions sincere, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to all under heaven. This passage must be fundamentally built up from the psychology. We can say that the initial work of transforming the heart should be to see the public and private clearly. To transform the heart, we must first eradicate the selfish and self-interested psychology. The Premier told us that the revolution is to seek happiness for the people and to seek freedom and equality for the country. If we want to achieve this goal, we must first change the psychology of each individual in the people. In recent years, many young people are driven by improper intentions, not for the public but for personal gain. Once there is selfishness, no matter what they do, they cannot succeed. Therefore, the Premier tells us that revolution must first transform the heart. Only by transforming the heart can we achieve the goal of revolutionary success. If we do not change all kinds of bad psychology, then all revolutionary work will be superficial. We are all Premier's followers and should lead the people from a position of knowing later. But if we do not understand public and private, and do not change the bad habits of society, then we cannot complete the mission of the revolution. When the Premier was dying in Beiping, he said, "I have devoted myself to the National Revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China," and we must also start with changing our own various bad psychology. Our revolution is in a serious period now, and we must work harder to move forward. In the future, we must make efforts to reform bad psychology in order to complete our revolutionary mission. Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek added slightly to the original topic, stating that the Chairman has just carefully explained the Premier's teachings of "Revolution Must First Transform the Heart." In the future, our party comrades must follow the teachings, start with their daily lives, words, deeds, appearance, and attitude, cleanse away old habits, and thoroughly transform their hearts. They should also emphasize order, observe discipline, work hard to serve, and develop the spirit of initiative and creativity, because if we want to revitalize people's hearts and change customs, we must first set an example, and then we can lead the people, transform society, build the country, and complete the revolution. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Chairman Lin Sen reported on "Children's Issues" at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 16th, first stating that in the Premier's second lecture on nationalism, China has been oppressed by population issues for nearly a century. China's population is always not increasing, while foreign populations are always increasing day by day. Now, we are also being oppressed by political and economic forces. We are simultaneously oppressed by these three forces. If there is no solution, no matter how large China's territory is and how large its population is, after another hundred years, it will inevitably perish. Therefore, the population problem occupies the most important position in the national problem, and is the basic problem of the national problem. He stated that the increase in the number of children nationwide is directly related to the increase in the national population, so the children's problem is also the basic problem of the population problem. Our country has suffered from natural disasters and wars for many years, and the reduction in the child birth rate and the increase in the mortality rate are imaginable. Even in relatively stable families, there is a lack of research on children's education, health, and entertainment, and they are even allowed to be unruly and drop out of school, treating children as personal possessions, and events such as selling or drowning babies occur. These problems are extremely serious in the national sense. He continued, saying that all countries in the world attach importance to children's issues and have regulations for Children's Day to awaken the people of the country to change their views and attach importance to children. Our country urgently needs to correct children's concepts, conduct health inspections, pay attention to hygiene, popularize education, cultivate abilities, awaken children's responsibilities, and cultivate children's morals. However, children's own self-cultivation must also be correctly guided by family parents and adults in society, and government agencies must also provide strong support. He added that children's education is the basic problem of children's problems. At this time of national crisis, and with Children's Day approaching, he specifically raised this issue to draw the attention of the people. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Nanjing. The Mongolian Political Council recently telegraphed to Nanjing from Bailingmiao for relief due to the disaster in Mongolia. The original telegram is as follows: Respectful greetings, we have inquired that the various leagues and banners of Mongolia have traditionally made a living by nomadic herding due to climate and geography, and do not engage in other production. Unfortunately, since last winter, the climate has been unusually cold, with heavy snowfalls, accumulating several feet on the ground, sparkling for thousands of miles. The barren grass and broken thatch were all covered, and all the cattle, sheep, camels, and horses were suffering from hunger and cold, and died almost entirely. Those who were previously rich have suddenly become impoverished, lacking food and on the verge of starvation. Those who are crying for help are all waiting to be fed, and the wailing geese fill the fields, with suffering and wounded eyes everywhere. The miserable conditions of displacement and the cries of sorrow are shocking to hear and heartbreaking to see. An unprecedented catastrophe has never happened before. If no measures are taken to provide relief, then there will be few survivors left after the catastrophe. We look up to our wise and intelligent officials, who cherish the hungry and embrace the wounded, and who are able to look far ahead and carefully calculate national affairs. We are now telegraphed to plead for the people. We earnestly implore the Relief Committee to allocate large sums of money to provide urgent relief. We also hope that fellow compatriots from all walks of life will have compassionate hearts and the virtue of Heaven's love for life, show great kindness, and provide substantial assistance, so that the millions of survivors after the disaster can be reborn and avoid death. Then the country will be fortunate, and Mongolia will be fortunate. In haste, we are extremely anxious and await orders. Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee.

<h3 id="e23">The Urgent Need to Promote Rice Seed Improvement <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper published a report from the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group containing a statement by Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, saying that the yield of early rice in Guangdong can be increased by 25% after improvement. Although there are no precise statistics on the production and consumption of food in our country, the large-scale import of foreign rice, which accounted for the most important position in last year's customs statistics, with a value of 50 million customs gold units, indicates that China's food supply cannot be self-sufficient, and the seriousness of the problem can be imagined. Experts studying the food problem have also loudly appealed to the people to wake up, and the political authorities are planning food controls to remedy the situation. However, there are myriad details, and the main focus should be on increasing production. That is why this reporter felt particularly interested after learning about the improvement results in Guangdong and hopes that rice seed improvement can be actively promoted.</p>
<p>First, examine the achievements of various parties in rice seed improvement to clarify the possible figures for increasing production. Guangdong is as mentioned above. The other two known to the reporter are: The Agricultural College of National Central University took a common variety from Kunshan called "Large Seed Xian" and conducted advanced experiments for four years, which increased yield by 16%. The Crop Improvement Experimental Farm of Yenching University in Beiping conducted eight years of experiments and cultivated an improved rice seed, which increased average yield by 30%. Based on this, the possible yield increase from rice seed improvement ranges from 16% to 30%. The national total yield of Xian and Geng rice in a full year in China is 873 million dan. Even if the actual harvest each year is discounted from this number, the increase in production after improvement should exceed 50 million shi, which is also quite considerable.</p>
<p>Secondly, calculate the amount of rice shortage in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, which are the most severely affected by the food crisis, to clarify the assistance that rice seed improvement can provide to the Chinese people's food supply. Guangdong Province produces more than 78 million shi of rice annually, and according to some statistics, the shortage is 25 million shi. Zhejiang Province, according to the Civil Affairs Department's announcement last year, produces more than 43.7 million shi of rice, with a shortage of 10 million shi. The amount of rice needed from outside sources in Guangdong Province is more than 33% of its production. At first glance, this is alarming, but compared to the improvement results, the percentage of shortage can be greatly reduced. The shortage in Zhejiang Province is less than 23%, which can be remedied even more by the improvement results. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that the promotion of improved rice seeds is one of the most important steps to solve the current food problem.</p>
<p>The reporter is not unaware that solving the food problem involves various political and economic relationships in addition to increasing production, nor does he believe that the promotion of improved rice seeds can be effective overnight while ignoring the obstacles in the process.</p>
<p>All the above arguments only recognize that rice seed improvement can be practically carried out, striving to increase production, which is better than empty talk of any plan.</p>

<p>Tokyo The Cabinet Deliberation Council, established by the Okada Cabinet for the purpose of deliberating on national policies, has no active significance. After the collapse of the Okada Cabinet, the view that the Cabinet Deliberation Council is useless has gradually gained strength. Therefore, the abolition of the council has become a matter of time. On the other hand, the opinion has arisen to expand the Cabinet Investigation Bureau, enrich its functions, and implement policies to deal with the emergency situation. The government authorities also hold the same opinion. Currently, Director General Yoshida of the Investigation Bureau is studying the expansion of the six laws. It is reported that his specific plan is: to transfer part of the authority of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to the Investigation Bureau, so that the budgets of various provinces can be reviewed from a broad perspective; to transfer part of the authority of the Legislation Bureau to the Investigation Bureau, so that important policies can be deliberated and reviewed. In addition to the above two items, there is also a plan to make the Director General of the Investigation Bureau a minister without portfolio, which is currently under study. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo In order to cope with the emergency situation, the Hirota Cabinet intends to reorganize and reform the administration. Therefore, the voice of abolishing the Colonial Affairs Ministry is getting louder. However, Colonial Affairs Minister Nagata and other top officials of the Colonial Affairs Ministry advocate the importance of colonial affairs administration, saying that in the era of Japan's advancement, it is necessary to reform the domestic administration and carry out overseas development policies at the same time. Therefore, the Colonial Affairs Ministry should in the future encourage emigration to Manchuria, and at the same time ensure the development of Japanese people in the South Seas and Brazil. Therefore, expanding the scope of the Colonial Affairs Ministry and strengthening its power is the most suitable way for Japan to advance. However, any talk of reducing or abolishing the Colonial Affairs Ministry is the most extreme form of going against the times. (Domei dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo Nagata, the Minister of Colonial Affairs, visited Prime Minister Hirota at his official residence at 1:30 PM today. Because he was looking for a full-time Minister of Education, this visit was decided. It is worth noting that Nagata may be transferred to the position of Minister of Education, as was the case at the time of the formation of the cabinet. (Den-tsu dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Difficulties for Japanese Finance Minister Baba in Reorganizing Finances: Contradiction Between Increasing Taxes and Issuing More Public Bonds <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo The issue of increasing taxes, which is the central focus of Finance Minister Baba's fiscal policy, will be considered by the Ministry of Finance authorities and the Cabinet Investigation Bureau. Most of it will be used as a source of funds for the inflated defense budget. However, Finance Minister Baba's fiscal policy is mainly aimed at the development of industry and the expansion of trade. Therefore, it is difficult to expect a significant effect from the implementation of social policy-oriented tax increases. Moreover, the impact of tax increases will affect mass taxation. As a result, the budget will expand, and there is no doubt that it will have a profound impact on the entire nation. The active public bond policy implemented in conjunction with the tax increase has always lacked smoothness, and when its total amount is about to break through the huge number of one hundred million yuan, it will be even more difficult to carry out when tax increases are forcibly advanced. If it is forcibly promoted, the public bonds will increase significantly, people's hearts will be uneasy, and the value of stocks will fall, leading to a phenomenon of malignant inflation. It is doubtful whether the fundamental principle of Finance Minister Baba's fiscal policy, the stability of the people's livelihood, can be maintained. In the existing economic machinery, if we want to establish a gradual correction policy, the simultaneous implementation of increasing public bonds and tax increase policies will create contradictions, and there is a major risk hidden in the adjustment work.

<p>Rome General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, recently issued a communiqué confirming that an Italian bomber had been shot down by the Abyssinian army and fell behind Abyssinian lines. Five Italian soldiers on board were killed.

<p>London The League of Nations Council's Committee of Thirteen had previously requested both Italy and Abyssinia to begin peace negotiations, which both countries accepted one after another. The committee was originally scheduled to meet in Geneva on the 10th of this month, but the sudden abolition of the Locarno Pact by Germany occurred, and the countries were busy dealing with this case, and had no time to take care of the peace negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia, so the meeting period was postponed again and again. According to reliable sources, Italy is now eager for the League of Nations to quickly conclude its sanctions policy against Italy, so that Italy can be satisfied, and the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia can be resolved from now on. Therefore, it has made a special request to the Council to convene the Committee of Thirteen immediately. For this reason, the committee has been scheduled to meet here in the middle of this week. Italians in London believe that if European problems are to be resolved across the board, whether based on the seven proposals put forward by German leader Hitler or other plans, Italy must participate in it. This must be conditional on the abolition of sanctions against Italy. British political figures also believe that under the current circumstances, if someone can propose a solution to the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, even if it is favorable to Italy, British public opinion can probably accept it and will not obstruct it as in the past.

<p>London Hitler, in response to the request of the Council of the League of Nations, has put forward two conditions for sending representatives to attend the meeting on Sunday, which are unacceptable. Therefore, the hope of Germany attending the meeting is now weak. The conditions are: Any discussion should be conducted on an equal footing; discussions of the Locarno Treaty should simultaneously address Hitler's proposals to conclude a pact of non-aggression, a pact of the skies, and the Franco-Belgian joint opening of a demilitarized zone. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London French Foreign Minister Flandin made a statement to the press yesterday evening, saying that his purpose in coming to London was not to negotiate with Germany, but to have the Council of the League of Nations condemn Germany's violation of the Locarno Pact. If he cannot achieve this, he would pack his bags and return home, or even consider leaving the League of Nations. The phrase "leaving the League of Nations" was ambiguous and could easily lead to misunderstandings, or it might be thought that France intended to leave the League of Nations. Flandin has since issued a statement correcting this, saying that the original intention of his speech was that "if necessary, I would rather resign from my position as France's representative to the League of Nations." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London Today, it is indicated here that Britain will unite with France to reject Germany's conditional acceptance of the League of Nations' invitation to attend the Council meeting, which has suddenly sharpened the entire situation, and Britain must clearly decide its attitude afterward. It is generally believed that Britain's rejection of Germany's conditions will be announced at a secret meeting of the Council of the League of Nations on Monday. According to the League of Nations, the situation has been extremely chaotic for a week. After Britain and France received Germany's reply today, it became even more tense. Most of the League of Nations representatives expressed their opinions, saying that recent developments have greatly reduced the hope of improving the international situation soon.

<h3 id="e36">One Word in the German Reply Causes a Storm: "Immediately" vs. "As Soon As Possible" <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>London The Council of the League of Nations formally invited Germany yesterday in its capacity as a signatory to the Locarno Pact to send representatives to Britain to attend the Council meeting tomorrow afternoon in order to respond to the application submitted by France and Belgium. The telegram was sent to Berlin by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol. Avenol received a reply from the German government at 6 PM this afternoon, which stated: "The German government is prepared in principle to accept the invitation of the Council of the League of Nations, but it is hoped that it will be recognized that the German representative will enjoy completely equal rights with the representatives of other countries when the Council meeting discusses and votes. In addition, there is a fundamental fact that should also be noted, namely, that the German government's statement, which the two countries of France and Belgium used to apply to the Council of the League of Nations, is not only to restore Germany's sovereignty in the Rhineland region, but also is related to the broad and specific proposals it has put forward to enable European peace to be guaranteed in a new way. The German government regards this action as a single whole, which cannot be forcibly split by anyone. On this basis, if the countries concerned are indeed prepared to immediately submit Germany's proposals to negotiation, then the German government can participate in the Council meeting of the League of Nations." Signed by German Foreign Minister Neurath. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London In the reply sent by Germany to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, the conclusion stated: "If the countries concerned are indeed prepared to immediately submit Germany's proposals to negotiation, then the German government can participate in the Council meeting of the League of Nations." According to German sources here, the word "immediately" has two meanings in the original German: one is "immediately," and the other is "as soon as possible." The current translation as "immediately" seems to be inconsistent with the original intention. If so, the meaning of the conclusion of the German reply is very different. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Berlin The conditions put forward by Germany for accepting the invitation to participate in today's Council meeting of the League of Nations have caused a storm. German leader Hitler now seems willing to show some concession. It is reported that although Germany still insists that the Locarno Pact and Germany's peace proposals should be discussed simultaneously, it does not object to handling or discussing this matter separately or sequentially if it is practically impossible. However, Germany's proposals must not be deliberately delayed from discussion. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London After the German government submitted a strong reply to the Council of the League of Nations yesterday, negative impressions arose in all quarters. The German government is now trying to mitigate this, so it ordered its embassy in Britain to send personnel to the British Foreign Office to state that the League of Nations Secretariat's translation of the word "Absbald" used in its reply as "immediately" was inaccurate. This word originally meant "appropriate time" and did not mean "immediately." Observers believe that this move by Germany is because the negotiation work presided over by the Council is likely to fall into a stalemate, so it issued a correction in the hope of facilitating it. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London After German Foreign Minister Neurath made a correction regarding the translation of the word "Absbadl," observers here still believe that the Council of the League of Nations may not immediately consider the proposals put forward in its memorandum of the 7th of this month. The reason is that this proposal is related to Britain, France, and Italy, and Belgium, Poland, Lithuania, Austria, and the Czech Republic are not members of the Council. Their opinions must also be heard. In short, the Council will not advise the above countries to immediately start negotiations with Germany, so that these negotiations can begin with that country's forceful actions. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London In the German reply to the League of Nations yesterday, there was the word ABSBALD, which was translated as "immediately." According to German sources here, this word is interpreted as "immediately" in northern Germany, and as "as soon as possible" in southern Germany. The reply submitted by the country was jointly drafted by the country's leader Hitler, Foreign Minister Neurath, and legal expert Gaus. These three are all from southern Germany, so this word should be interpreted as "as soon as possible" according to southern customs. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin The newspapers reported that the German government intends to send the legal adviser of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gaus (who participated in the drafting of the Locarno Pact in 1925), as a representative to attend the Council meeting of the League of Nations, and that Gaus has already arrived in London. However, according to this reporter's knowledge, Gaus has not left Berlin. The above news is naturally untrue. It is generally believed that if the conditions put forward in the German reply are accepted by the Council of the League of Nations, the Ambassador to Britain, He Xu, will attend as a representative. It is believed by political figures that the German government attaches importance to the second condition, and will not send representatives to attend the Council meeting of the League of Nations until the countries agree to negotiate on the peace proposals put forward by the leader Hitler. Moreover, even if they attend, the German representatives will never participate in the Council's discussion of condemning Germany's abolition of the pact. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin After giving a speech in Munich, German leader Hitler returned to Berlin today with General Ribbentrop. After arriving in the capital, he immediately entered the residence by car and consulted with Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Aviation Minister General Goering, and Foreign Minister Halte for a long time. A draft of the reply to the League of Nations' request to send representatives to participate in the Council meeting to be held in London on Sunday was drawn up, and the reply was immediately sent to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol. The Rhine German army originally intended to hold a large-scale parade in Frankfurt at noon on Sunday, but it has now been canceled, probably because French public opinion has shown some concession. However, the arrangements for the German army to blow the horn to welcome Hitler's visit will not be changed. Hitler's speech will be broadcast everywhere by wireless. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>London. The League of Nations in London holds a grave view of the current situation in Europe. They believe that Germany's reply regarding its participation in today's meeting of the League of Nations Council has not improved the situation. A tense state, resembling a stalemate, still exists. Therefore, great importance will be attached to the remarks of British Foreign Secretary Eden at the Council meeting this afternoon, and attention will also be paid to the remarks of Italian Ambassador to the UK, Grandi, as Italy will officially reveal its views and intentions. However, the afternoon meeting may not be as public as expected. This morning, the British Cabinet convened to consider the situation created by the German reply. All cabinet members attended. Foreign Secretary Eden first consulted with French Foreign Office officials before attending the cabinet meeting. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin. France's refusal to discuss the new proposals put forward by Head of State Hitler to replace the Versailles and Locarno Treaties has led people to believe that the hope of using the League of Nations to mediate the Locarno crisis has been completely shattered. Germany reiterated today that the troops sent to the Rhineland are only a "symbolic" force and cannot be withdrawn. It is believed here that Hitler has put forward the final conditions for League of Nations mediation and has already stated that if other countries cannot accept them, they can be cancelled. Well-informed observers believe that Hitler will not change his demands due to French pressure. Therefore, although Germany has accepted the invitation of the League of Nations, it is unlikely to send representatives to participate in the Council meeting. France's rejection of Hitler's second condition has increased the threat of a military solution to the Rhineland dispute. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>London. After the League of Nations Council officially invited Germany to send personnel to attend the meeting, the German reply arrived last night. The Daily Telegraph reported that "British Cabinet officials, after reading the German reply, all believed that it was unacceptable to the League of Nations, and that Germany's intention was clearly to alienate Britain and France. Therefore, it is not only difficult to accept but also detrimental to the overall situation. Previously, British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, had contacted the German government regarding the issue of participating in the Council meeting. People originally hoped that after this contact, Germany would unconditionally accept the invitation of the Council and attend the meeting. The representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium had held several private talks based on this intention to bring their opinions closer together. At that time, the French representative expressed complete understanding of the British government's position. Therefore, some people suggested that Britain provide new guarantees for the security of France and Belgium to compensate for the inadequacy of the Locarno Treaty. Unfortunately, as a result of Britain's contact with Germany, the German government's attitude in its reply remained firm. Therefore, the above suggestion had to be modified." The report also believed that when the League of Nations Council meets this afternoon, the Soviet Union, Russia, Italy, and the Little Entente countries will definitely adopt a very firm attitude towards Germany, "because these countries are all afraid that the German government will take action within the year and absorb the German-speaking minorities in Czechoslovakia, thereby causing disputes in Eastern Europe."

<p>London. According to League of Nations sources, when the League of Nations Council holds a public meeting tomorrow, the representatives will likely unanimously condemn Germany for violating the Locarno Treaty. This matter will be decided at a secret or non-public meeting of the Council tonight. It is rumored that the Council will adjourn after meeting in London tomorrow and will hold its next meeting in Geneva on March 23. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London. According to the opinions of some delegations in the League of Nations Council, the German reply in its current form seems difficult for the public to accept. The Council must first announce the verdict that Germany violated the Locarno Treaty before discussing Hitler's proposed answer. Germany's request to participate in the meeting on a basis of full equality will make any vote of conviction impossible. It is unreasonable for a country that has violated an international treaty, while other countries are considering its breach of contract, to hope that those countries will discuss its proposed suggestions to replace the treaty it has destroyed. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London. The German government recently submitted a reply to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, accepting in principle the country's participation in the Council meeting, but with two conditions attached. League of Nations Secretariat personnel believe that before the Council holds a public meeting tomorrow afternoon, it should first hold a non-public meeting to study the German reply. British Foreign Office officials also said that the conditions put forward by Germany should be studied by the Council. Its first condition, regarding equal rights, will definitely be opposed by some countries. In the opinion of those countries, the Council should first publicly condemn Germany's act of abandoning the treaty. As for the second condition, that negotiations should begin immediately on Hitler's proposed suggestions, it will also be strongly opposed, because the future decisions of the League of Nations Council cannot be dictated by Germany in advance. According to Hitler's proposals, there are seven points, the main ones being: France, Belgium, and Germany should sign a treaty of non-aggression for a period of 25 years, and the Netherlands can also join; France, Britain, and Germany should sign a treaty on the European and Asian skies; Germany is willing to sign treaties of non-aggression with its eastern neighbors; Germany is prepared to return to the League of Nations, but on the condition that the League of Nations charter excludes the Treaty of Versailles and that equal rights regarding colonies are recognized. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London. According to League of Nations personnel, among the various events related to the situation this week, the issue of sanctions against Germany is the most important. However, at this time, the majority of member states of the League of Nations oppose imposing practical and effective sanctions on Germany. Among them, Britain is deeply afraid that Germany may resort to retaliatory measures in military and financial terms, so it strongly opposes it. Regarding finance, financial circles here believe that once sanctions against Germany are implemented, Germany will definitely abolish the agreement between Britain and Germany on commercial debts. According to the agreement, Germany owes British merchants a total of 15 million pounds, and the repayment method is clearly stipulated in this agreement. British banks rely on this agreement to include German debts under assets. If Germany abolishes the agreement, the debts will have no whereabouts and will naturally be listed as bad debts and written off annually. Then, the banks that maintain the debt will inevitably fall into crisis and have to ask the Bank of England for assistance. As far as the general public knows, the Bank of England strongly disagrees with the sanctions policy and has exerted pressure on the Cabinet to prevent sanctions against Germany. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London. The League of Nations representatives here are increasingly pessimistic about the situation, believing that the severity of the situation is no different from the eve of 1914. Britain hopes that once the League of Nations condemns Germany for violating the Locarno Treaty and the Treaty of Versailles, it should accept Hitler's suggestions and engage in negotiations. However, the demands of the anti-German countries are not only empty condemnations, but also severe actions to follow. The representatives of France, Belgium, Russia, Turkey, and Romania are all demanding sanctions against Germany and hoping that Britain and Italy will assist France. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>

<p>London. British circles are quite disappointed with Hitler's reply. This is partly because the British government had strongly assisted the League of Nations Council in issuing a request for Germany to participate in the meeting. People feel that as a result of the reply, the overall situation has deteriorated. It was originally hoped that the request would lead to a slight turning point, but now everything has returned to the situation before the request was issued. It is expected that when the League of Nations Council meets this morning to consider Hitler's second condition, difficulties will arise at the meeting. What can be certain now is that the Council will hold a secret meeting to discuss the overall situation. British opinion is that accepting Germany's first condition should not be too difficult, as it is believed that the powers may be able to reach a compromise on this point. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London. Diplomatic circles believe that Hitler's reply is very clever, as its wording seems sufficient to confuse the other signatories of the Locarno Treaty, namely Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium. Hitler's second condition, which contradicts France's claim that Germany must first withdraw its troops from the Rhineland before France can discuss Hitler's proposals, directly touches on the disagreement between Britain and France. Although Britain and France now have a tendency to accommodate each other, it is expected that Belgium will support France and take a firm stance together. (Reuters, 15th) The Times said in today's editorial that the German reply regarding its participation in the League of Nations Council meeting on Sunday is disappointing. German leader Hitler should provide further clarification on the second condition of his acceptance of the request (i.e., the Locarno Treaty should be discussed simultaneously with German peace in advance). If his explanation is that Germany should attend the Council to participate in the discussion of strengthening the treaty system to avoid future destruction of the treaty, then this is a reasonable explanation of the League of Nations' duties. The newspaper also said that judging from the situation, French security may not benefit from refusing to negotiate the new Locarno Treaty proposed by Hitler. The Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post both said that the German reply is a conditional acceptance, equivalent to a rejection, which is very disappointing. Germany is now losing a golden opportunity. The Daily Mirror said that after Germany's entry into the Rhineland, the situation has now reached the most serious crisis point. Fortunately, the leaders of all countries want peace. The Daily Express said that if Hitler wants a solution, then what he is doing now is the most stupid thing he can do, because he has angered France and disappointed Britain. The News Chronicle said that French Foreign Minister Flandin's reply to Hitler, stating that he does not want to discuss other matters except for Germany's destruction of the Locarno Treaty, is worded too aggressively and lacks restraint and foresight. British public opinion does not want to support a break. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>Kulen reports: The "Manchukuo" Foreign Office feared the notice issued by the "Mongolian People's Republic" Foreign Minister on the sixth day of this month regarding the principle of organizing a mixed Mongolian-Manchurian committee. It also requested that the various issues that Gu Xianwei would hand over to the committee for discussion and the location where the committee would work be explained. On the tenth day of March, the Mongolian Foreign Minister replied, stating that the Mongolian government, based on its letter of February 29, proposed to take investigating and determining the various circumstances and causes of the armed clashes on February 12 as the basic task of the committee. If the committee can accomplish this task, it is willing to entrust the committee with the investigation of other border incidents and clashes that occurred in 1935 and 1936, and to consider ways to prevent such border incidents. Regarding the location of the committee's work, the Mongolian government proposed Tamsiksen in Mongolia and Ganer (transliteration) in Manchuria, so that the committee could hold meetings alternately in both locations.

The Russian Foreign Office once submitted a concrete plan for resolving this case to the Japanese ambassador to Moscow, Tishan, on the 9th of March, which was forwarded to the "Man" government by the Japanese government.

Therefore, both sides are gradually approaching the stage of the meeting. However, there is still a small point of contention that has not been resolved, which prevents the meeting from being held immediately. Outer Mongolia insists that any meeting between the representatives of both sides is limited to past events, while the "Man" side is willing to guarantee future friendship.

At the same time, news from this side indicates that many Japanese military personnel are currently in Berlin consulting with the highest German military authorities on the issue of how the East and West can cooperate to restrain Soviet Russia when Russia takes action against Germany based on the Mutual Assistance Treaty with Czechoslovakia. Therefore, observers here all believe that if war unfortunately breaks out, Soviet Russia will inevitably be attacked from both the East and the West. (National News, 15th) Warsaw. Since Germany rescinded the Locarno Treaty and advanced its troops into the Rhineland, Poland's position has become important. The attitudes of the country's political circles and public opinion are therefore worthy of attention. The opposition People's Party convened its annual National Representative Congress here yesterday, firmly advocating that in the midst of the current drastic changes in the international situation, Poland's alliance with France must be maintained. Although the party is in opposition, it can represent the masses of farmers in the country, and its advocacy cannot be ignored. In addition, the National Radical Party, which is composed of elements separated from the ruling party, also issued a resolution stating that various organizations formed by people in France are actively operating in Poland, and it is clear that they are directed and subsidized by the German government, but the Polish authorities are actually accommodating them, which is improper. In addition, former Prime Minister and former Army Minister General Sikorski recently published an article in the Polish Post, discussing Germany's re-fortification of the Rhineland, saying that the Rhineland is extremely important to Britain and France in terms of military strategy, and that it is no less so for Germany's eastern neighbors. It also said, "Regarding this incident, the countries concerned are now holding talks in London. From Poland's point of view, regardless of the outcome of these talks, Poland's partnership with France should be made rock solid. The absolute and independent condition for Poland's policy is to advance in the same direction with the current European and French understanding." Former Senator Goscoski also published an article in the newspaper, saying, "Poland has always held a pro-France attitude. This is due to the 'political conscience' of the Polish nation, and not merely out of emotional effect. The position in which France is placed is extremely important for Poland, and Poland’s actions must not be ignored in this regard." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>The leader of the "Iron Guard" in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, Prime Minister Goga, recently delivered a speech at a political gathering, saying that since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty, Romania should cooperate with France, but in his personal opinion, if France and Germany can reach an agreement, it is necessary for Europe to establish lasting peace. As for the agreement between Romania and Soviet Russia on mutual assistance, if Soviet Russia can unconditionally recognize Romania's sovereignty over Bessarabia Province (which belonged to Russia before the war and is now owned by Romania), Romania can sign this agreement.

<p>Madrid. A civilian who sympathized with the Fascist Party today attempted to assassinate the leader of the Socialist Party and former Minister of Labor, Gabannuro. However, Mr. Gabannuro was fortunate to escape unharmed. When the civilian surrounded his residence, he fired at it with pistols and rifles, but Mr. Gabannuro hid indoors and was not harmed. The rioters then dispersed. After the assassination attempt, riots broke out again in Lauregno last night. Fascist Party members and left-wing elements fought for a long time in the center of the city, resulting in one death and six injuries. Sympathizers of the left also set fire to a church, three monasteries, a newspaper office, and the headquarters of the Fascists. (National News, 15th)</p>
<p>Madrid. The Spanish Fascist Party, led by Rivera the Younger, the son of former dictator General Rivera, had its party headquarters closed after the left-wing parties formed a cabinet as a result of the Congressional re-election last month. Rivera and other important party members such as Tehada were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment by the court. The Fascists in various places rioted upon hearing the news. In "Puerta del Sol Street" in the capital, Fascist Party members distributed leaflets expressing their protest and saying that "Communists are rampant, and the government should not sit idly by." As a result, conflicts broke out with left-wing people, and they exchanged gunfire. In Salamanca, people from the left and right factions also conflicted with each other. A right-wing female supporter died by gunshot, and another girl was also hit by a stray bullet and died from serious injuries. The police arrived and arrested many people before order was restored.

Thereupon, congressmen from the Socialist Party and the Communist Party all stood up, sang the Internationale, insulted Galanzha, and raised their fists as if to strike him. Mr. Galanzha immediately withdrew from the meeting, and the unrest subsided. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Tianjin correspondence: Major General Isogai Rensuke, military attache at the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, along with Major Utsunomiya, military attache, arrived in Tianjin from Beijing on the morning of the 12th. Upon arrival, they were greeted by Staff Officer Doeki and Adjutant Jinbo, dispatched by the Japanese Garrison. They were taken to the Tokiwa Hotel residence, and then went to Zhang Yuan's official residence to meet with Commander Tada. After a discussion lasting about two hours, Tada hosted a banquet. Military attaches stationed in various parts of North China arrived in Tianjin one after another, because Isogai had been ordered to convene a meeting in Tianjin. Those who arrived on the morning of the 12th included Takeashita Yoshiharu, head of the Kwantung Army's Shanhaiguan Special Service Agency, and Hayama Kiro, head of the Suiyuan Special Service Agency. At 2:00 PM that day, Isogai convened a meeting centered around himself within Zhang Yuan's official residence. Attendees included Nagami Toshinori, Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Garrison; Staff Officer Hayashi (Major); Doeki Mitsuo (Captain); Senior Adjutant Otake (Major); Utsunomiya (Major), military attache in Shanghai; Takeashita (Colonel); Hayama (Major), and more than ten others. First, Nagami reported on the recent diplomatic and public security situation in the Hebei-Chahar region. Then, the internal plans brought by Isogai were divided into three points for discussion: 1. The issue of anti-communism in North China, the attitude that Japan should take towards the northward movement of the central army, and the problem of strict monitoring of public security in Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, and Suiyuan; 2. The establishment of the new Hebei-Chahar political power, the attention that should be given to it, and the promotion of its implementation of planned measures; 3. The adoption of close liaison methods among military attaches stationed in China in the future. The meeting lasted a long time, and only ended at 5:00 PM. On the evening of the 12th and the morning of the 13th, Oomoto Shiro, a military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, and Wachi Takaji, head of the Datong Special Service Agency in Taiyuan, arrived in Tianjin one after another. Isogai convened another meeting to discuss the aforementioned three items in detail. Wachi, a lieutenant colonel, reported on the situation of the communist bandits in Shanxi Province. The meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Isogai, along with Major Utsunomiya and Colonel Takeashita, went to Peiping, where they visited Chairman Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Major Imai, the military attache stationed in Peiping, to discuss public security in North China and exchange views. On the afternoon of the 14th, they left Peiping for Jinan, where they were accompanied by Ishino Shiba, the military attache stationed in Jinan, to meet with Han Fuqu. The trip to Qingdao was cancelled, but Takahashi (Lieutenant Colonel), the military attache stationed in Qingdao, came to Tianjin on the night of the 13th, planning to return to Jinan with Isogai on the 14th in order to discuss everything in the car. Before the 17th, Isogai rushed back to Nanjing to report the results of the consultations in North China to Ambassador Arita. At the same time, Arita will present his views when he visits President Chiang. In summary, the mission of Isogai's trip to North China was mainly focused on anti-communism and public security in North China. The military attache sent by the Emperor of Japan to China was originally scheduled to be attendant Hirayama before the February 26th Incident, but later Major General Nakajima was sent instead. On the morning of the 12th, Nakajima arrived at Tanggu aboard the Great Wall Maru and disembarked. Ishii, a senior staff officer of the Tianjin Japanese military, greeted him. At noon, he inspected the Tanggu garrison, read out the Emperor's message of condolence, and toured the troops' barracks. At 7:30 PM, he took the Beining train to Tianjin, where he was welcomed at the East Station by Tada and his staff, as well as Japanese Consul General Kawagoe. On the 12th, he visited the shrine, inspected the garrison at Haiguang Temple, and read out the message of condolence. In the afternoon, he inspected reservists, the volunteer corps, boy scouts, and the National Defense Women's Association. In the afternoon, he toured military hospitals and various schools. In the evening, he listened to Tada's report on military affairs and Nagami's report on North China's diplomacy and the political situation in Hebei and Chahar at Zhang Yuan's official residence, and attended a banquet hosted by Tada. On the morning of the 14th, he observed the garrison's street fighting exercises. In the afternoon, he went to Peiping to review the troops. On the morning of the 16th, he read out the message of condolence in Peiping. In the afternoon, he went to Tongzhou to comfort the troops and to speak with Yin Rugeng to learn about the situation in eastern Hebei. On the 17th, he flew to Gubeikou to review the troops.

<h3 id="e79">Xiao Zhenying Holds Birthday Celebration for His Parents; The Celebration Was Prepared for Two Months; The Cost is Estimated at 50,000 to 60,000 Yuan; Tens of Thousands of People Sent Gifts <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Peiping correspondence: Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying is holding a large celebration this year for his parents' 66th birthday. The celebration preparations began two months ago and were extremely thorough. Recalling the grand birthday celebrations of Zhang Zongchang in the past, this surpasses them. The banquet hall is located in the second courtyard of the residence. There were originally ten trees in the courtyard, but because it was early spring and they had not yet sprouted, the preparation committee ordered florists to cover the trees with peach blossoms made of velvet. Amidst the clusters of flowers, there were also red and green electric lights, which shone brightly at night. In the center of the birthday hall, there was a golden statue of the Old Man of Longevity, with a plaque inscribed by Xu Shichang hanging above. On both sides were couplets written by Yu Youren, Cao Kun, and Feng Yuxiang. Chairman Lin, President Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, as well as Hu Hanmin, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi, all sent precious birthday gifts, which were displayed in the corridors, leaving almost no space. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, personally wrote a plaque, carved from nanmu, referring to himself as a "nephew." The silver five-piece altar set, publicly gifted by all the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army, was five feet tall, inlaid with green jade, and the craftsmanship of the tripod and censer was exquisite. Division Commanders Feng Zhian, Zhang Zizhong, Liu Ruming, and Zhao Dengyu jointly presented a large silver plaque, with pure gold dragons inlaid around it, which was a noteworthy item for the guests to appreciate.</p>
<p>Although Xiao only sent out three thousand invitations, the number of gift registry entries had already exceeded thirty thousand by noon on the 15th. Some estimate that the value of all the birthday gifts is at least 100,000 yuan. The gifts received on the afternoon of the 15th and the 16th are not included. In addition to the various precious items in the birthday hall mentioned above, there was also a golden slip of paper inscribed with "Mr. Chen Juesheng presents a full banquet from Fengzeyuan." Fengzeyuan is one of the most famous restaurants in Peiping. Xiao's residence has ordered from six restaurants, including Chinese, Western, and vegetarian cuisine. A total of one thousand tables are needed for the two days, and Fengzeyuan alone is responsible for three hundred tables. Therefore, the first to benefit from the grand gathering at Xiao's residence were the gold shops, restaurants, and Xiang embroidery shops, all of which saw their business triple.</p>
<p>On the 15th, for the pre-birthday celebration, because there was a theatrical performance, over a thousand guests arrived by noon. At that time, representatives from the Peiping and Tianjin Chambers of Commerce presented plaques, banners, and umbrellas to the residence, led by a band, with great pomp. Xiao personally came out to welcome them and fired cannons to pay respect. As for other gifts of banners and umbrellas, large and small, there were over a hundred items, filling both large courtyards. After a sumptuous meal, the representatives from the Peiping and Tianjin Chambers of Commerce were invited by Xiao to listen to the opera, including Lu Sujuan's "Qi Shuang Hui" and Shang Xiaoyun's "Han Mingfei." They did not leave until late at night when the performance ended.</p>
<p>The Peiping local authorities, for the security inside and outside Xiao's residence on the 15th and 16th, had carefully agreed on measures with the birthday celebration preparation committee. Police Chief Chen Jiyan and Garrison Commander Shao Wenkai were responsible for security, leading their subordinates to handle matters carefully. At the same time, there were a total of over two hundred greeters from various circles, stationed at the entrance to welcome guests. If the greeters did not recognize a guest, even if they had an invitation, they were not allowed to enter in order to prevent any problems. As a result, many people were turned away. As for the arriving and departing vehicles, designated routes were established. All vehicles entered from the east entrance of the North Barracks Street. After the passengers alighted, the empty vehicles exited from the west entrance and turned north, circling back to the outside of the east entrance of the North Barracks Street to wait for orders. When passengers needed a vehicle, the person in charge would call for it by phone. Military police responsible for maintaining traffic wore special badges for identification.</p>
<p>The 16th was the actual birthday, and the excitement can be imagined. Birthday envoys from various places arrived in an endless stream, from far and wide. There were also those who presented theatrical performances, and famous actors such as Yu Shuyan and Yang Xiaolou performed their best plays to add to the occasion. In short, in the desolate city of Peiping, after the Spring Festival, although thousands of shops had closed down, this grand gathering at Xiao's residence brought a sense of joy to some of the merchants and people who benefited. It is estimated that the cost of the grand gathering at Xiao's residence was at least 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, which is quite impressive. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Remnant Bandits on the Fujian-Zhejiang Border Gradually Defeated; Gangs Robbing Vehicles on the Fuzhou-Quanzhou Road to be Eradicated Soon; Gao Chengxue's Accomplices Sneak Back to Fuding and are Arrested <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: It is reported that remnant bandits have recently been found harassing the Zhejiang border again. The Fourth Pacification Zone Command in eastern Fujian ordered Zhang Qiong, the commander of the 25th Brigade stationed in eastern Fujian, to send troops deep into the area to pursue and suppress them. Xuan Tiewu, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, also led the Zhejiang Provincial Security Force to be deployed in the Pingyang and Taishun areas to encircle and attack them. The bandits have been completely defeated. The bandit leader Liu Ying barely escaped with his life. Brigade Commander Zhang has telegraphed the province to report the victory, and Director Xuan has also returned to Hangzhou. In addition, the security regiment is clearing and suppressing bandits in the territory of Fu'an County. The other day, over fifty members of the bandit gang surrendered with their weapons. The regiment has agreed to give them a chance to turn over a new leaf and redeem themselves by meritorious service. As for the areas of Xiapu and Fuding, the Fourth Pacification Zone Command received a telegram yesterday from the First Security Regiment, stating that the Fifth Company of the Second Battalion of the regiment encircled and suppressed scattered bandits in Leibaoluan, killing the leader of the pseudo Third Column Guerrilla Team, Wang Agang, and six other bandits. They seized five rifles, one pistol, and fifty-three bullets. However, Wang Guangchou of Shouning colluded with Zhang Apeng, who seized firearms, and Xu Qiewei to commit widespread pillaging and killing, causing the people to live in misery. Since February of this year, the bandit gang has killed Gong Qisheng and two others in Dashu Village, Ye Jiaxiu and one other in Houkeng Village, Ye Aben and two others in Guanyang Village, Xia Yafang and three others in Zhetou Village, Ye YouShu and four others in Tuanshi Village, Xu Faqian in Tieluping Village, as well as three people in Qiushan Village, eight people in Xidi Village, three people in Badai Village, three people in Caikeng Village, and four people in Danggang Village. However, the surnames are not known.</p>
<p>The bandit gang led by Wei Geng, which robbed long-distance buses on the Fuzhou-Quanzhou Highway, has been surrounded and severely suppressed by government troops. According to military sources, the various units suppressing the bandits are currently attacking from all sides. There have been engagements on the front lines in recent days. The bandits have lost their ability to resist, and some have fled to the islands of Pingtan and Fuqing. In order to eradicate them as soon as possible, the provincial authorities have ordered the Fifth and Tenth Security Regiments and the Fourth Gendarmerie Regiment to actively advance towards the bandits, and have telegraphed the garrisons in Fuqing, Pingtan, Yongtai, Minqing, and Minhou counties to strictly defend and suppress them. It has also been learned that since the robbery case occurred, many bandit parties who fled to various parts of Taiwan have returned to Fujian to engage in activities. Special telegrams have been sent to various coastal units to earnestly investigate and prevent them. The other day, Song, the battalion commander of the Tenth Security Regiment stationed in Gaoshan City, Fuqing County, received a tip that Lin Konghua, a cohort of the Gao Chengxue gang, had led over ten bandits and secretly returned to his residence in Yuanxi. He immediately sent troops to arrest them. The bandit leader Lin Konghua was killed on the spot, and Lin Kongjiang, the brother of the bandit, was captured, along with a rifle. Several other bandits were injured and fled under cover of darkness. Investigations are still ongoing. Yesterday, the provincial authorities dispatched the Special Service Battalion of the Security Department to Fuqing County to reinforce the bandit suppression efforts and temporarily garrisoned in the county seat to suppress the bandits. The 49th Regiment of the 9th Division also dispatched a battalion from Putian to garrison in Honglu Dongzhang in the county to suppress the remnant bandits as the opportunity arose. The county authorities have notified all groups not to be alarmed. The Construction Department also convened the governments and security departments of Minhou, Fuqing, Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, and Jinjiang counties, as well as the headquarters of the Third and Fourth Pacification Zones, to hold a Fuzhou-Quanzhou Highway Protection Conference in Putian on the 13th to discuss ways to ensure the safety of vehicles on the road in the future.</p>
<p>In northern Fujian, the secret societies in the border areas of Jian'ou, Nanping, and Shunchang counties have been rampant again in recent days, and robberies occur frequently. The other day, the entire family of a certain village head in Baisha, several miles from Yangkou, was seized by bandits. The village head has already been killed. The 56th Division sent a company of troops to investigate in various villages, but the secret societies are extremely cunning. When the troops arrive, they all transform into civilians. When the troops leave, they run rampant in the countryside. The village heads and bailiffs are afraid of retaliation and dare not report, making it impossible for the officers and soldiers to suppress them. Li Yutang, the commander of the Third Division, who has recently been transferred from Pucheng to Nanping, has decided to come to the province in the coming days to discuss the issue of the secret societies in northern Fujian with the authorities.

<h3 id="e81">Noteworthy Doctor in Xiamen, Ye Ruiting, Kidnapped and Murdered; Kidnappers Sent Letter to Victim's Family Demanding Ransom After Murder; Bandits Used Abandoned House as Hideout <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Ye Ruiting, a well-known doctor at Tiande Hall on Datong Road in Xiamen, was kidnapped on March 5th due to his thriving medical practice and accumulated wealth. A group of bandits, calling themselves the "Bird Needle Gang," rented an empty house at No. 77 West Park Road. They sent an old woman with a note to Tiande Hall, requesting Dr. Ye to make a house call. Once he arrived, they abducted him and demanded a ransom of 6,000 yuan, with a five-day deadline, threatening to kill him if the ransom was not paid. They also warned against reporting the incident to the authorities. Police detectives investigated the case for several days without success. Shockingly, on the 10th, Dr. Ye's body was discovered in an empty house at No. 6 Xianfeng Camp, revealing he had already been murdered.</p>
<p>The rented empty house used for kidnapping and concealing the body was not far from the Public Security Bureau. The time between the kidnapping and the discovery of the body was exactly five days. The new houses at No. 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 Xianfeng Camp are all owned by the Huang family of Cuntang Sixth Market in Junzai Alley. No. 14 was rented to a person named Zai, while the other four remained vacant and were advertised for rent. The keys were left with Zai Jinshan, the tenant at No. 14, so prospective renters could obtain them from Zai to view the properties.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of March 2nd, a young man in his twenties came to Zai to get a key to view a house. They agreed on a monthly rent of 5.5 yuan, and the young man paid a deposit of 5 jiao before leaving. Around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of March 5th, the same young man returned for the key, saying he was going to clean up the place in preparation for moving in. Several days passed, but he neither returned the key nor moved in. Upon inspection, the door had been replaced with a new lock. Zai reported this to the landlord, Huang Shangjin, who together with Zai hired a locksmith to open the door. Inside, they found an empty box, a pair of black trousers, a hemp rope, a wad of cotton with traces of blood, apparently used to gag someone, and a cloth bag. In the back room, there was a pile of earth and sand, a broom, and two rows of floor tiles, with ten tiles already loose, as if they had been pried up and relaid. Realizing something was amiss, they reported it to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Workers were hired to dig beneath the loose tiles, and after digging two feet, they found a human hand. Continuing to dig to four feet, they unearthed a corpse. Someone recognized it as Ye Ruiting and immediately telegraphed Ye's family and the court. Ye's family arrived and confirmed the identity of the deceased as Ye Ruiting. The court examined the body and found the limbs not yet stiff. The deceased was wearing a black cloth short shirt and pants, black socks, and cloth shoes. There was a wound on the forehead, the skin slightly broken, about an inch long, without any damage to the bone, appearing as a graze. Blood had flowed from the ears and nose, and blood had also flowed from the anus. The jawbone was protruding, the skin unbroken, but the inner bone was protruding. There were rope marks on both wrists, forming a diagonal pattern, with a purplish-blood color. The entire body showed black and blue bruises. The left eye was tightly closed, while the right eye was slightly open. It was determined that the deceased had been buried alive and suffocated. However, the time of death could not be determined. After the examination, the court instructed Ye's family to prepare the body for burial.</p>
<p>After Ye was kidnapped, his family and employees were threatened by the bandits and kept the matter secret. When detectives heard rumors and inquired, they were still hesitant to reveal everything. They had also followed the bandits' instructions and replied to a letter, nailing it to a utility pole on West Park Road, requesting a reduction in the ransom. The letter was indeed taken, but there was no further response. On the morning the body was discovered, they received another letter from the bandits, stating: "Our gang initially borrowed 6,000 yuan, which had to be paid within five days. Now that the deadline has passed and you have not paid the full amount, and you have reported the case to the authorities, which is truly abominable. Now that the deadline has passed, 10,000 yuan is required. If you delay any further, we will take drastic measures."</p>
<p>It seems that the bandits who kidnapped Ye were well-organized and had a detailed plan. The empty house at No. 77 West Park Road and the empty house at No. 6 Xianfeng Camp, where Ye's body was hidden, were both rented on March 2nd. On the afternoon of March 5th, Ye was kidnapped on West Park Road. On the same afternoon at 2:00 PM (one hour before the kidnapping), they had already picked up the key to No. 6 Xianfeng Camp. According to neighbors of Xianfeng Camp, they saw people carrying a wooden box into the house on the evening of the 5th, assuming it was movers and did not pay attention. However, some said they first saw them carrying it in on the 9th. It is difficult to determine when exactly it was carried in.</p>
<p>The box, upon inspection, was 2.5 feet deep, 3 feet long, and 2 feet wide. It was a wooden box used to store orchid-brand tobacco. The box had luggage tags from a hostel that said "28 Nihonmachi, Old Pasar, Singapore, Yuanji Hostel" and "Xu Tianxu Ershun" and "Fujian." It appeared to be the belongings of someone returning from Southeast Asia. There were two footprints inside the box, as if Ye had struggled violently inside after being bound. The broken skin on the head was likely caused by hitting the box during the struggle. The fox-fur coat, worth 200 gold yuan, which Ye was wearing when he was kidnapped, had been stripped off. Ye's body and the surrounding area were covered in a great amount of white powder that resembled lime. When smelled, it had a medicinal odor, likely used to absorb the moisture from the decaying body to prevent swelling and odor. The meticulousness of the planning and the composure of the actions are evident. Even after Ye's death, they sent a letter demanding a ransom, seemingly wanting to hide the body and then extort another sum of money. Therefore, some suspect that in addition to the kidnapping for ransom, there may have been underlying resentment. This can only be proven after the case is solved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wu Ruifu, a famous doctor on Kaiyuan Road, received a letter on the 12th signed "Bird Needle Gang" demanding money. The letter stated: "We kidnapped Ye Ruiting and incurred significant expenses, resulting in financial difficulties. Please quickly send 3,000 yuan to Miaoshi Temple, where our gang will send someone to collect it. Otherwise, we will take drastic measures against you." It is unknown whether this was done by the kidnappers of Ye or someone else using their name to intimidate Wu. (March 15th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Resignation of Members of the East Yong'an Fire Brigade</p>
<p>The East Yong'an Fire Brigade in the second district of this city has recently been greatly inconvenienced in firefighting due to a lack of hoses. It was proposed to purchase ten new ones, requiring 500 yuan. A meeting of the board of directors was convened to discuss fundraising methods. However, none of the nine directors attended. The members, feeling disheartened, jointly submitted their resignations to the leader on the 16th.</p>
<p>Caojing Police Station Apprehends Long-Time Bandit</p>
<p>Niu Wanpi, an officer from the ninth substation of the Public Security Bureau, learned that Feng Jindou, also known as Zi Gen, from No. 6, Jia, Sipao, Chongque Three Bao, was suspected of being a bandit. He immediately dispatched a team to arrest him. Under interrogation, Feng confessed to robbing Chen Baogen's house in Sunjiaqiao, the Xia family and Gan Mingsi's house in Yinglong Township, and Feng Zhaolin's house in the Sixteenth Tu, among others. All of these robberies occurred in December of last year, one after another. The Public Security Bureau has copied the confessions and sent them to the county for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Car Accident Causes Death</p>
<p>Xu Mao Yuan, the 18-year-old son of Xu Jinshou, a villager from the Ninth Tu, Yidu, Hengtang Township, six or seven li from the city, and an apprentice stonemason in Huangshanhong, was walking on the Sumu Highway near Xikuatang on the 15th when a long-distance bus No. 4 from Sumu Road, traveling from Suzhou to Mu, swerved to avoid another small car, knocking Xu Mao Yuan down. He suffered severe injuries to his abdomen and legs, and bled profusely, losing consciousness. At the same time, Qiu Da Xiaomao was also injured. The bus immediately stopped and transported the injured to the city, intending to take them to Bo Xiong Hospital for treatment. Xu Mao Yuan died in the vehicle due to the severity of his injuries. Qiu Da Xiaomao was sent to the hospital for treatment, and it is believed that his life is not in danger. The driver, Ling Jiangsheng, was detained by the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau and reported to the District Procuratorate for dispatch of personnel for inspection. The Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau sent Ling Jiangsheng to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the District Court for interrogation on the 16th. All expenses for the coffin and burial of the deceased are to be borne by the Su-Fu Long-Distance Bus Company. The company will also convene a board of directors meeting to discuss compensation issues.</p>
<p>Social Education Personnel from Various Counties Submit Petition to the Ministry for Relief</p>
<p>Social education institutions in counties such as Su, Xi, Chang, and Kun have been ordered to shut down, and closed on the 15th. The social education personnel will go to the province for training to prepare them for future roles as principals of central primary schools and guidance of civic training matters. However, the social education personnel are concerned that salaries will not be paid during the training period, and they are opposed to this. After a discussion at the Education Association of Wuxi County previously, on the 16th, the social education personnel of each county jointly submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Education, requesting that salaries be paid during the training period to maintain their livelihoods, and also submitted a petition to the Ministry of Education for relief.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Buddhist Monk of Juesheng Temple Taken to Court</p>
<p>Ying Ru, the abbot of Juesheng Temple in Huishan, was reported to the Supervisory Section of the Public Security Bureau in July of last year by a visiting monk, Zhi Lun, for harboring filth. Police were dispatched, broke into the underground chamber, and found smoking paraphernalia, bamboo tiles, women's clothing, shoes, and other items. The monks Ying Ru, Zhi Yin, and Chang He, as well as a woman named Jiang Wenzhen (also known as Miss Jin), were taken to the bureau and transferred to the county government for detention. The county government sent Ying Ru and others to the County Rehabilitation Center for compulsory drug rehabilitation, and later sentenced them to imprisonment. They have now completed their terms. However, the monks are also suspected of digging up graves, which should be handled by the judiciary. Yesterday, the county government transferred them to the court. After an interrogation by Prosecutor Lu, he ordered that they all be detained pending investigation.</p>
<p>District Secretaries Across the County Appeal</p>
<p>The county government had already abolished the fee charged by district secretaries for issuing certificates. An order was issued to each district to strictly prohibit this. Upon learning this, the district secretaries of each tu and district were greatly alarmed, believing that their livelihood was in jeopardy. The district secretaries convened a meeting on the premises of the Chengqu Primary School on Sanhuang Street in the city to discuss relief measures. More than 400 district secretaries from across the county attended the meeting. They decided to elect representatives to petition the Party and government authorities, unanimously appealing that if they do not receive satisfaction, they will all resign.</p>
<p>Actively Constructing the Wuxi-Xi Highway</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Wu-Jiao Highway, there has been no highway between Wujin and Wuxi. Previously, the Wu-Jiao Long-Distance Bus Company proposed the construction of the Wu-Xi Highway and submitted a plan and budget to the Department of Construction for approval. After receiving the submission, the Department of Construction believed that the construction of the Wu-Xi Highway was necessary, but the project was massive and difficult to begin immediately. Currently, the Department of Construction plans to send personnel to Wuxi within a few days to survey the route. The road will start from Henglin in Wu, passing through Lishe, Yuqi, Qianzhou, Beiqifang, and Shichuang, to Tangtou Bridge, connecting to the Xi-Cheng Highway, and reaching Wuxi. Another theory is that the road will start from Henglin and reach Qingyang in Jiangyin, connecting to the Xi-Cheng Highway.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Civil Servants Undertake Labor Service</p>
<p>Civil servants in the urban area of Wuyi County are undertaking labor service to construct the ring road around the city. The county government has ordered technician Shen Zhiyu to set the central markers, and work began on March 15th. At 8:00 AM that morning, all county government employees gathered in the grand auditorium for roll call, then proceeded to the Third Section to collect hoes and other tools before departing for the construction site outside the South Gate. More than 1,000 employees from other agencies also arrived on time to start working, displaying great spirit and diligence, and did not disperse until the evening. It is also reported that the construction projects of the county government and the county Party headquarters have been completed, while other agencies and schools will continue to work on the 16th.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Eight County Treasuries to be Established</p>
<p>In order to standardize the revenue and expenditure of local funds in counties of Jiangsu Province, the provincial government established county treasuries. Since its establishment, it has had great success. Currently, with the exception of Jiangpu, Jurong, Lishui, Yangzhong, Pixian, Siyang, Xiaoxian, and Yizheng, all other counties have already established them. It is reported that the provincial government has decided to establish treasuries in the eight counties of Jiangpu, etc., and will order the Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Bank to establish offices or branch offices in four counties each. It is understood that the Farmers Bank has decided to establish offices in Jurong, Jiangpu, Lishui, and Yangzhong, and has appointed Chen Yanxiang, Gu Shixiang, Hua Yaxiong, and others to be responsible for the preparations. The Jiangsu Bank will establish offices in Yizheng, Qixian, Xiaoxian, and Siyang and has also appointed people to prepare for their establishment. Currently, they are actively working on it and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Nantong: County Magistrate Hong Takes Office</p>
<p>The newly appointed Nantong County Magistrate Hong Sheng (courtesy name Zhuangyou, from Liaoning) arrived in Tong from Shanghai on the 15th and took office on the 16th. The former county magistrate, Jin Zonghua, has left Tong. The handover was handled by his secretary. The key officials of the county government are appointed as follows: Secretary Tian Honghai, Chief of the First Section Wang Youwen, Chief of the Second Section Zhang Yu, Chief of the Third Section Wang Mengzhou.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Ten-Year-Old Boy Dies in Bicycle Accident</p>
<p>The ten-year-old son of Lu Ganling (American), the principal of the American-Chinese Middle School of the Anglican Church inside the Bianyi Gate in Yangzhou City, was intelligent, lively, and loved by all. He was particularly skilled at riding bicycles and was beloved by his father. During leisure time, father and son often went to the suburbs together, riding bicycles for pleasure. However, this morning (15th) at 10:00 AM, Lu went to school for worship. The child tried to ride his father's bicycle. Because the bike was high and his legs were short, he fell from the bike as soon as he left the gate. He was stabbed in the left eye by the iron bar of the bicycle. He was found and helped up by a gatekeeper but was already unconscious. Lu rushed back, called for a doctor to diagnose and treat him, but he bled too much and died before treatment could be administered.</p>
<p>National Studies Specialization School Opens</p>
<p>The National Studies Specialization School in Yangzhou held its opening ceremony this morning (15th) at 9:00 AM. More than 30 students and dozens of representatives from various agencies and groups attended. Hu Zhen and Han Guojun (represented by Ma Shuang) and Wang Boling, were elected as permanent directors of the school board, with Wang Boling presiding over the ceremony. Wang reported on the preparations. Next, Zhou, the principal of the provincial middle school, and Xin, the director of the Education Bureau, gave speeches, saying that the school was training talents for the future, with unlimited prospects. Then, Jiang Taihua, the principal of the school, responded, and the group took pictures before the meeting adjourned. It is reported that the school's curriculum includes Classics (taught by Xu Xibo), Prose and Parallel Prose (taught by Chen Ciqing and Cheng Xizhi), Poetry (taught by Cheng Cangguang), and History and Geography (taught by Jiang Wuzi and Zhang Yuping).</p>
<p>Dinghai: Second Section of the Dinghai Fire Brigade</p>
<p>The various districts of Dinghai City are densely populated and commercially prosperous. However, firefighting equipment is still primitive. A proposal was initiated in the 22nd year [of the Republic] to organize and establish a fire brigade, which has now been in existence for four years, with remarkable achievements. To facilitate firefighting, a second branch association is being established at the foot of Dongyue Temple Mountain. Zhou Xiangsheng, a gentleman from Dinghai who lives in Shanghai, donated funds to build the association hall, which has now been completed. The opening ceremony is scheduled for April 1st.</p>
<p>Bengbu: Human-Powered Rickshaw Donation Trend Expands</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rickshaw pullers requesting a reduction in donations, the provincial government has clearly ordered a reduction of two jiao, with payment of one yuan. The rickshaw pullers belonging to the rubber-tired rickshaw association have complied and received licenses. Most of the rickshaw pullers from the rickshaw pullers' union are still waiting. On the 14th, three hundred rickshaw pullers gathered at the Rickshaw Pullers' Union to discuss how to respond. They split into two groups, one going to the Public Security Bureau to petition, and the other going to Dama Road, where they destroyed the rubber-tired rickshaws that had already received new licenses. The police on duty stepped forward to stop them, but were attacked by the rickshaw pullers, and three policemen were injured and a pistol was lost. Two rickshaw pullers were beaten. The situation was very chaotic for a time and the situation was very serious. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to suppress them, dispersing the petitioning rickshaw pullers and arresting twelve rioting rickshaw pullers. One soldier who had mixed in and caused trouble and two women, relatives of the rickshaw pullers who went to the bureau to cause trouble, were also taken to the bureau and detained for interrogation. Thirty-seven rickshaws belonging to the rubber-tired rickshaw association were destroyed and towed to the bureau for inspection. The Public Security Bureau immediately convened an emergency meeting with the military, police, Party, industrial, and commercial agencies. It was decided that: 1. The rickshaw puller riot should be reported to the provincial government and the provincial Party headquarters by the Public Security Bureau, the Party headquarters, and local organizations. 2. The damaged vehicles of the rubber-tired rickshaw association will be temporarily repaired by the Public Security Bureau on behalf of them. 3. The Military and Police Supervisory Department will issue a notice to strictly prevent riots. 4. The riot incident will be resolved by representatives from the labor union, the rickshaw pullers' union, the military and police agencies. 5. A thorough investigation will be conducted into the attack on the police on duty and the theft of a pistol, and the perpetrators will be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to an article in the "Outlying Areas Correspondence" section of your newspaper on the 15th of this month, concerning Sun Lu Qiangfen, the wife of Sun Zhonghao from Shintangwan, Wuxi. The article stated that Lu Qiangfen was the daughter of Lu Mingshu, the owner of the Luyoufeng Soy Sauce Garden on Guanqian Street in Wuxi, and a former teacher at Tangwan Elementary School in Shanghai. I am greatly surprised.</p>
<p>Lu Qiangfen's family had already published a notice in the Shen Bao and Min Bao on November 18th of last year, severing the father-daughter and family relationship because of misconduct. As for the suggestion that she was a former teacher at Tangwan Elementary School, many teachers have left Tangwan Elementary School, and it is unfair to generalize. Furthermore, Lu Qiangfen's misconduct occurred after she left the school and is a matter of personal morality, having absolutely nothing to do with the school. Moreover, there is no graduate named Chen Lin.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Han-Guangdong Travelogue (6) (Travel Correspondence from Our Newspaper Reporter) Hengyang <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Junhao</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway spans 1,096 kilometers, running from Guangdong to Hankou, with Hengyang as its central point. Consequently, the Zhushao section of the Engineering Bureau is located there. This area is a major county in southern Hunan, densely populated with bustling markets. Numerous scenic spots and historical sites are scattered throughout. With the full completion of the Yuehan Railway, the importance of Hengyang's position is self-evident.</p>
<p>We traveled from the foot of Mount Heng to the outskirts of Hengyang by car along the highway to the car station. Originally, we could have disembarked here, but since the car could enter the city, we drove into the city. The city walls are exceptionally low, easily reached by hand. The car drove in, and the archway almost reached the top of the car. The city is bustling and well-organized, and diligently promotes a new way of life, with signs directing pedestrians to keep to the left in the middle of the road. The road is being widened, with houses being demolished on both sides, but the road surface has not yet been completed. It is said that the Hengyang County government plans to use the revenue from fertilizer taxes to fund the road construction, which could generate tens of thousands of gold dollars a year. The commerce in Hengyang can be compared to that of Wuxi. Large stores are mostly located on the west bank of the Xiang River, in the Fencheng area. Branches of the Shanghai Bank, the Bank of China, and the Commercial Press are located there.</p>
<p>The Zhushao Section Engineering Bureau is located on the east bank of the river. It took us no more than five minutes to cross the Xiang River to reach it. After landing, the entire construction resembled a new urban area, with wide roads and rows of streetlights. At the crossroads, there were new-style police booths, round or square, extremely beautiful. The booths were also illuminated with red lights to facilitate traffic. We took a rickshaw from the riverside, and after ten minutes, we saw a magnificent building, which was the newly built Hengyang Station. This kind of architecture is still rare in southern Hunan. According to the Ministry of Railways' plan, it was originally intended to build the Engineering Bureau's office in Hengyang. However, the bureau, considering the short construction period, believed that there was no need to build it to save expenses. The Ministry of Railways approved the early construction of the station, and the bureau was relocated there before the railway was completed, to facilitate office work. Hengyang Station is a second-class station. The exterior architecture adopts a simple, dignified, modern three-dimensional style, divided into three levels: the underground level, the ground level, and the upper level, with dozens of rooms, all practical. Currently, passenger trains from Hengzhou run to Chenzhou, and many passengers enter and exit the station daily.</p>
<p>In addition to the station building, the bureau also allocated a large area south of the station as a residential area for its employees, covering more than 50 acres, with 16 buildings, divided into three Type A buildings, four Type B buildings, eight Type C buildings, and one apartment building. Each building has a square in front, planted with flowers and trees. Electric lights and running water are readily available. The residential area is called Lizhi Li, which resembles the new-style Shanghai alleys. However, these residences are all bungalows. Ding Wenjiang contracted coal poisoning in Hengyang, which was in the guesthouse in Lizhi Li. Hengyang is bitterly cold, making it unbearable. Spring is still like this, let alone in the depths of winter. Ding's coal poisoning was initially saved, but his old illness relapsed, leading to his death. Alas!</p>
<p>Mount Heng boasts many scenic spots and historical sites, including Huoyan Peak, the first of the 72 peaks of Mount Heng. It is said that geese fly here and turn back, hence the name. Also, the Dongzhou Bamboo Forest, with its secluded bamboo-lined paths, is where Wang Chuanshan taught. A Chuanshan School has been established nearby to commemorate him. In addition, when Wu Sangui fled to Yunnan, he first opened the altar here, so Hengyang still has the name Donghua Gate, and there are still traces to be found. In addition to those mentioned above, there are also Shigu Mountain (i.e., Shigu Academy), Yueping Mountain, Huayao Temple, West Lake, Sidu Pavilion, and Jiashuyuan (i.e., the Zhushao Section nursery). Due to time constraints, we were unable to visit any of these.</p>
<p>Hengyang is not only the central point of the Yuehan Railway, but also has highways that connect to Guangxi. Currently, the highways in Hunan Province have been built to the border, but the highways in Guangxi have not yet been extended due to the many high mountains along the route, making construction difficult.</p>
<p>When the employees of the Zhushao Bureau first came to Hengyang, due to the large number of people, they mostly purchased supplies from the markets, so the local area gained some income. However, prices inevitably rose over time. In fact, with so many employees, it would have been possible to set up a consumer cooperative when they first arrived in Hengyang, so that supply and demand could be met, and life could have been more comfortable.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to expedite the completion of the Yuehan Railway, the Ministry of Railways has sent three supervising commissioners to the railway. They are Zhou Liangqin, the chief engineer, Xia Quanshou, the chief engineer, and Nie Zhaoling, the section chief of the New Railway Construction Committee. Chief Engineer Zhou is old and served in the surveying department in the early days of the Yuehan Railway. In 1932, he served as the chief engineer of the Shaoguan-Lechang section. He knows the history of the railway well. Chief Engineer Xia also inspected and accepted the Shaoye section of the project. Section Chief Nie was the director engineer of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. These three are highly respected in the engineering field. After arriving, they visited the various engineering sections and made many plans for the progress of the railway project.</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Zhang Gongquan will inspect the Yuehan Railway. All parties are preparing to welcome him in the coming days. Li Xiangen, the director of the Southern Section, and Li Luchao, the director of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau, will both go to Hengyang to meet him. It is said that a comprehensive plan for the reorganization of the Southern Section and the Hubei-Hunan Section will be decided after the inspection.</p>

A portrait of Sun Yat-sen hung in the center, with the Party and national flags crossed on either side.

<p>Kong's Speech</p>
<p>At 11:40 AM, Finance Minister and Director Kong Xiangxi gathered all staff members in the main auditorium and delivered a speech. Director Ye Zhuotang reported, "Today is the opening day of the Central Savings Society, which has been specially approved by the government. Please, Minister Kong, deliver a speech." Kong then delivered a speech, saying, "Fellow colleagues, today is the opening of our Central Savings Society. Saving is a virtue. From youth to old age, people initially rely on their parents, and when they are able to stand on their own, they support their families. Moreover, our country is a family-oriented society. In addition to supporting their wives and children, people also support their parents. However, when they are old and weak, they should retire. At that time, they should have a way to support themselves. In the past, they relied on their children to support them in their old age. Now, social ideas are changing, and they cannot completely rely on their children. They should save their surplus during their working years to use for retirement. Our country has 400 million people. If each person saves one yuan, they can accumulate 400 million yuan. For example, the water of the Yangtze River flows from the upper reaches. The source of this water is the melting snow on the mountains or the accumulated rainwater. Therefore, collecting sand can form a tower, and accumulating small amounts can become a large amount. However, the money that is accumulated should be deposited in a reliable savings institution. At the same time, the savings institution can use the savings to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce. In the past, there was no reliable institution. Now, banks such as the Four Banks have a joint organization to expand their strength. Regarding national savings as a whole, the government has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to establish the Central Savings Society to achieve the goal of benefiting the country and enriching the people. When the Central Trust Bureau opened, I encouraged my colleagues with the words 'trust' and 'effort.' Today, the opening of the Central Savings Society has many meanings. It is to cultivate the virtue of national savings. At the same time, it is to use the people's savings to regulate the social economy. The purpose of the lottery savings is to encourage people's hope for savings. Everyone should work hard and uphold the principle of 'trustworthy,' so that the savings business will prosper. Use small savings to develop the country's entire agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. Today, we are honored to have leaders and representatives from all sectors to guide us. I would like to express my gratitude."</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Savers</p>
<p>From 9:00 AM yesterday, many people went to the Central Savings Society to obtain the charter. Because the society has preferential savings methods, over a thousand households have already joined. At the same time, many depositors of the Sino-French Savings Society went to the society to apply for exchanging their slips to continue saving.</p>

Sixty-five delegates and nine observers attended. Zhu Xuefan presided over the meeting, and Kong Fanzao served as the recorder. As it was Monday, the weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen was held. After the rituals, the chairman reported that today was the first official meeting of the congress, and it was auspicious to hold it on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. We must follow Sun Yat-sen's past spirit of struggle and work hard to promote the union's work and create a glorious history of the postal workers' movement. After the memorial service, the formal meeting began. First, Secretary-General Zhao Shusheng reported, followed by the receipt of many congratulatory telegrams.

The presidium approved the attendance of Li Liqiang, Zheng Wenquan, Hong Yongzhi, Chen Jingbao, Lin Guozhen, Chen Defeng, Zhu Xiangming, Ye Yunhan, and Li Anhe.

According to the presidium's agenda, the morning session discussed proposals from the union affairs group, and the afternoon session continued to hold the second meeting to discuss proposals from the bureau affairs group. A total of 37 proposals were submitted by the union affairs group. After review, five were deemed unnecessary to be submitted, five were to be submitted to the presidium, and seventeen were to be submitted to the congress for discussion. Many important proposals were resolved.</p>
<p>Condolences to Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>The first resolution was the proposal on how the union should express its condolences to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for his hard work for the country. It was decided to send a telegram of condolences in the name of the congress. The text of the telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission, since you have led the revolution, you have been diligently training the army and striving to be diligent. Your achievements are widely praised. At a time when the country is in deep crisis and the nation is in danger, we rely on your wisdom to guide us, to establish the foundation for the nation's new life, and to shoulder the great responsibility of revitalizing the nation. We, the representatives of the entire congress, respectfully lead 38,000 postal workers across the country with the utmost sincerity, to show our extreme resonance, and to serve you. We send this telegram of condolences. The entire delegation of the Third National Congress of the National Postal Workers' General Union, Lu Jingshi, Wang Yisheng, Han Dayong, Zhang Guangdai, Zhu Xuefan, and 72 others."</p>

<p>Trautmann</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, German Ambassador to China, Mr. Trautmann, has decided to depart from Shanghai on the 24th of this month aboard the North German Lloyd steamer "Scharnhorst" accompanied by his wife and others. It is understood that Trautmann will leave Beijing in the coming days to Shanghai to prepare for his journey. Trautmann, who has served in China for many years, has a very harmonious relationship with both Chinese and foreign affairs. This decision was made because he has not returned to his country for a long time, so he has requested leave to return home and report on the situation in China. The vacation is scheduled for seven months, and he is scheduled to return to his post in early November.</p>
<p>Naggiar</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in order to contact and connect, and to show citizens' appreciation for the upcoming arrival of the first French Ambassador to China, Mr. Naggiar, sent a telegram of welcome. After receiving the telegram, Naggiar was quite moved and specially asked Mr. Bodes, the French Consul General in Shanghai, to forward his gratitude. The following is an excerpt from the original letter from Consul General Bodes to the association: "Dear Sirs, Mr. Naggiar, the new French Ambassador to China, received your telegram in the capital of Serbia congratulating him on his return to China as the representative of France. Mr. Naggiar was extremely moved by this kindness and specially instructed the Consul General to convey his gratitude to the members of your association. I pray that you are well. French Consul General in Shanghai, Bodes."</p>
<p>Oshtovan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, according to news from the Iranian Consulate General in Shanghai, the new Iranian Consul General, Mr. Oshtovan, is scheduled to enter Beijing within this week to pay a visit to our Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Zhang Yuejun, to make his first visit after taking office.

<h3 id="e89">Common Interest, Concession Board of Directors Set to Elect Western Directors on Schedule <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The election of Western Directors of the Board of Directors of the Public Concession will be held on the 23rd and 24th of this month (Monday and Tuesday). There are two polling places: one in the drill hall of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Board of Directors, and one in the Hongkou Police Station. The time will be from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. The election tickets will not be issued in advance. Any citizen with the right to vote can go to one of the above locations at any time to receive the election ticket. At that time, the Motor Transport Section of the Police Department will also have regulations on the arrival and departure of vehicles. In order to avoid crowding, foreign citizens will be asked to vote early.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Westerners Carry the Board of Directors, Glimpses of Councilmen's Election, Westerners Hope to Vote, Japanese Bridge Denies Seeking Control <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, this year's councilman election of the Board of Directors, because the Japanese have nominated three candidates, one more than usual, is expected to be the most intense election in the history of the Shanghai Public Concession. If all three Japanese candidates are elected, it will not only overturn the distribution system of foreign councilmen of the Board of Directors for many years, but the total number of Asian councilmen will exceed the total number of non-Asian councilmen. At present, the councilmen of the Board of Directors are two Japanese, five Chinese, five British, and two Americans. If the Japanese occupy three seats, then China and Japan will have a total of eight seats, while Britain and the United States will have a total of only six seats. The Japanese Election Committee is currently conducting a large-scale election campaign. The American Election Committee met with Mr. He Weishi, Secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce, this afternoon (17th) to discuss ways to encourage Americans to vote. This morning, Mr. Peiersheng, the person in charge of the British Election Committee, claimed that the committee is currently doing its best to ensure that the five British candidates and the two American candidates win the election. According to statistics, there are 864 Japanese citizens in Shanghai with the qualifications to vote, 1,350 British citizens, 400 American citizens, 200 German citizens, and 1,000 citizens of other nationalities. The attitude of the German citizens is now very important. According to statistics, the total number of votes cast in previous years was the highest in 1934, with a total of 1,787 votes, of which the Japanese cast 800 votes. It is not possible to predict how many votes the Westerners will cast this year. However, if 850 Japanese people come out to vote, then there is a possibility of winning. However, if non-Japanese voters pay attention to this election and vote for British and American candidates, they can also reverse the situation.

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "To the Director, we have recently received a letter from Zhong Chunji Barber Shop, stating that, 'Regarding our electricity meter issue, we are extremely grateful that your association has forwarded a letter to the Public Works Department on March 2, urging the electricity company to negotiate reasonably. However, for the second installment, the company requires payment by approximately March 20, otherwise they will cut off the power supply. We believe the Public Works Department is the most impartial organization in the concession, safeguarding the citizens' rights. We hope that the improper fines we paid to the Shanghai Electric Power Company will be returned in full and impartially in the near future. Furthermore, we hope that not only will this be the case for us, but that other electricity users will no longer experience similar oppression. After this incident, we originally did not want to continue using electricity, but due to the nature of the barber business, which cannot operate without electricity, we have no choice but to temporarily endure the hardship. Your association is the voice of the Chinese taxpayers, and should not allow such pressure to be repeatedly applied to the taxpaying citizens.' Therefore, we request your department to investigate and handle this case, and order the electricity company to return the improperly gained fines. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department Director."</p>

<h3 id="e101">Memorial Service for Mr. Wang Guangqi Held the Day Before Yesterday, Various Circles Raise Funds for the Wang Guangqi Scholarship <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The memorial service for Mr. Wang Guangqi was held on time at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 15th) in the auditorium of the National Conservatory of Music in the city center. More than 100 people attended, including Xu Weiman, Guo Butao, Zhu Mengzhou, Huang Boqiao, Shu Xincheng, Shen Yi, Zhu Gong, Tai Shuangqiu, Shen Benqiang, and students from the National Conservatory of Music. Shu Xincheng chaired the meeting, Huang Zhongsu was the master of ceremonies, and Wu Yizhou played mourning music. The chairman delivered the closing remarks, stating that Mr. Wang had studied in Germany for sixteen years and had never received any subsidies from the government or private sources. His daily life depended entirely on writing. His great spirit of perseverance was a model for modern youth. Then, Zuo Shunsheng reported on Mr. Wang's life and mentioned that Mr. Wang was the founder of the Young China Association, which was based on the spirit of science and social activity to create a Young China. He said that Mr. Wang's words and deeds throughout his life were worthy of this title. Originally, Xiao Youmei, the president of the National Conservatory of Music, was scheduled to give a speech, but he was unable to do so due to illness and was replaced by Huang Zi, a professor at the school. His speech mainly introduced Mr. Wang's contribution to music and recognized Mr. Wang's "History of Chinese Music" and his efforts to popularize music as having the most indelible value. Guo Butao's speech mainly reported on the situation of running a newspaper with Mr. Wang in Sichuan in his early years and praised Mr. Wang's knowledge and personality. Huang Boqiao's speech mainly stated that he had three feelings about attending Mr. Wang's memorial service today: First, why did Mr. Wang give up studying politics and economics and specialize in music? According to our speculation, it may be because he saw that although our country is known as a land of ritual and music, ritual is now lost and music is gone. Second, Mr. Wang has studied in Germany for sixteen years and has never received a penny of subsidy from the government or private sources. This spirit of hard study should be the first among Chinese students studying abroad, making those students who receive public funds or family support but do not work hard feel ashamed. Third, the richness of creation and translation is a pioneer in bridging Eastern and Western cultures. In addition, he also elaborated on the fact that Chinese people do not pay attention to sports and their lives are not rationalized. The meeting adjourned at 11:45 a.m. After the meeting, the guests gathered in the conference room of the National Conservatory of Music to hold a discussion meeting on matters related to commemorating Mr. Wang. Shu Xincheng chaired the meeting and reported on three proposed methods: raising funds for the Wang Guangqi Scholarship to reward rising talents in the music field, publishing a commemorative album, and finding ways to transport and organize the manuscripts and belongings left in Germany. It was decided to expand the organization of the Wang Guangqi Memorial Committee and elect Shu Xincheng, Huang Boqiao, Guo Butao, Xiao Youmei, and Shen Junyi as standing committee members. It was also decided to set the amount of the scholarship at 5,000 yuan as the goal, and the Memorial Committee would plan to raise funds. Donations from friends of Mr. Wang's life and those who sympathize with Mr. Wang's character are welcome. The Shanghai Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shishi Xinbao newspapers were entrusted to collect donations. On the same day, Mr. Wang's manuscripts were displayed at the meeting place for condolence. Excerpts from the elegies sent by various circles are as follows: 1. Elegy from Zhonghua Book Company: "Lifelong hardship, studying in a different land, the most difficult is sixteen years in Germany, without public or private subsidies, everything depends on my own hands, the sea is vast, where to call the soul, only leaving millions of words of manuscripts, dare to be a family and society to mourn, not related to prestige to cry for this person, 3. Elegy from the colleagues of the National Conservatory of Music: "A master admired for generations, with numerous writings, leaving the history of music to benefit the world, spending years studying rhythm, living in a foreign land, Beethoven accompanies you forever in the night," 3. Elegy from Pan Gongzhan: "The overseas wind returns, should not forget the young China, the beacon is urgent by the river, can you leave the musical fire to pass on," 4. Guo Butao's elegy poem: "Since the day I broke the willow on the long embankment, I have remembered your brilliant essays every year, how could I expect the overseas geese to be cut off, and say that the poet turned into a fairy, the events of twenty years ago are bitter, your elegant demeanor is also my teacher, the Zeng Song drifted away and you also passed away, how can I bear to reread the Qingming words," Shen Bao's couplet, "The sound of sheng and crane breaks far away in the sky, Shanghai has a connection that can be mourned, the ivory tablet reaches the foreign land, the heart history is enough for thousands of years," Zai Boqi's couplet, "Specializing in translation, using your talents to confront your lofty ambitions, suffering from a serious illness in a foreign land, incurable and painful spirit,"</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Chinese Child Welfare Association Sends a Letter Reporting the Disaster Situation in Hua County, Henan, with 300,000 Victims Lacking Food and Shelter, Children Sold for Several Yuan Each, a Tragic Situation <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association previously sent staff member Huang Zhenying to Yanshi, Henan to handle disaster relief for children, which has been quite effective. Now, it has learned that Mr. Huang recently sent a letter to Shanghai describing the disaster situation in Hua County, Henan, stating that there are 300,000 victims in the area, lacking food and shelter. Children are being sold for several yuan each, a tragic situation. Attached is an explanation from Xie Suian, the magistrate of Hua County: "An investigation reveals that Hua County has suffered from flooding for three years. In 1933 and 1934, the government and local charities were able to raise funds for disaster relief. In 1935, heavy rains caused successive disasters, affecting an area of over 50 million acres and 300,000 victims. Food and shelter are lacking, resources are exhausted, and raising funds is difficult. Relief efforts are minimal. The old and weak have already died of starvation, while the strong are taking risks. Former wealthy people are now impoverished. Deaths from starvation, cold, and bandits are heard of every day. The tragic situation is no different from hell on earth. Since the beginning of spring, nine out of ten houses are empty. Land is being sold at a tenth of its value, but there are no buyers. Children are being sold to other regions for only a few yuan. The heartbreaking sight brings tears to one's eyes. In addition, the higher sandy lands have become barren, while the lower lands remain flooded. The wheat harvest is hopeless. The long spring and summer will lead to the demise of the victims who lack clothing and food. I hope that you, the government and charities, will show great compassion and provide prompt relief so that the survivors of the years of disasters can leave behind their offspring and maintain local security. This would be like rebirth for parents and a living Buddha for all. I respectfully lead the victims to offer incense and pray, in the most urgent expectation."</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: The Chinese Women's Association has always been praised by all circles for its enthusiasm for social undertakings since its establishment. All income from its annual charity ball is used for good deeds. Last year, the association donated funds to various organizations, including the Nanjing Ningbo Agricultural Relief Association, Shanghai Red Cross Hospital, Aviation Association, Women and Children's Hospital, and Jiliang Institute.

In order to promote compulsory education, the association also donated funds to women and children's supplementary schools in Yangshupu and Ximen, so that the children of the working class can receive preliminary education. However, this expense is not small. One of the schools, founded by the Chinese Young Women's Christian Association and funded by the Women's Association, will be forced to close if it cannot raise 2,800 yuan. Other good deeds and the progress of social undertakings also require sufficient economic resources to be promoted. The annual charity ball is scheduled to be held on March 19 at the Paramount Hotel. The members have been busy preparing for it. It is reported that all the programs are more exciting than in previous years. In addition to the association, Sullivan on Nanjing Road and the International Hotel also sell tickets.

<h3 id="e110">Yu Shun Steamer Returns to Shanghai After a Perilous Journey; Enters Dock Today for Major Repairs; Due to Ice Accumulation at Monkey Reef, Shanghai-Tianjin Route Still Requires Detour <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun steamer departed from Shanghai at 2 PM on January 12th and arrived in Yantai on the 16th. The weather was already very cold, but there was no ice on the sea surface in Yantai. It was not until the 17th, when the ship reached the Zhili Bay, that thick ice was seen. This was the first time the Shanghai steamer encountered ice. The Yu Shun pushed forward through the ice, which was one to two feet thick along the way, for six hours, covering thirty li. At 6:45 PM, the ship became frozen and immobile. After eight hours, the northwest wind blew it towards the Shandong coast, one hundred li from Dagu. The vast ice field was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Survival Amidst Death</p>
<p>At this time, the entire crew and passengers, a total of 167 people, were all in fear for their lives. The shipowner, Li Yunqu, took command on the bridge, foregoing food and rest for twenty-five hours. The ship's food supply was running low, and there was only one day's worth of coal left. Shipowner Li, along with Chief Mate Sheng Zengshou and others, resolved to survive amidst death. They first used the bow to ram through the ice. Then, due to the damage to the forward hold by the ice, they switched to using the reverse gear method, using the stern as the bow, and alternately advancing and retreating for fourteen hours of perilous navigation. They managed to reach Dagu at 10 PM at night.</p>
<p>Blocked Upon Arrival at Dagu</p>
<p>On the 18th, upon seeing the Dagu lighthouse, the people felt relieved, knowing that they were only ten nautical miles away from the light. The Yu Shun continued to use stern navigation, pushing through the ice for three hours. Due to the lack of tide and the thickness of the ice, and the absence of a pilot, the ship anchored near the lighthouse. On the morning of the 19th at 10 AM, a pilot arrived and guided the ship to Tanggu to load coal, replenish water, disembark passengers, and replenish food supplies. They departed Tianjin on the 21st to unload cargo and repair the ship. After eight days in Tianjin, they returned to Tanggu on the 29th. At that time, Zhili Bay was completely frozen, with the inland ice being six to seven feet thick, and the offshore ice being three to five feet thick. Tianjin and Tanggu were completely sealed off, and the Yu Shun was blocked from leaving the port for a long time.</p>
<p>Breaking Through the Ice to Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Yu Shun was blocked by ice in Tanggu for two months and two days. It was not until the 10th of this month that a pilot suddenly arrived, saying that the ice outside the Dagu port was loose and passable, and the ship could set sail. They departed at 2 AM on the 10th and reached Bohai Bay at 12 PM, but encountered ice again. After three hours, they still could not break through. Because before the 10th, the outer layer of ice outside Dagu had been blown by the northwest wind to Monkey Reef (Hokiat Hs.). The Yu Shun still had difficulty moving forward. The shipowner again used forward and reverse gears, and after half an hour, they managed to break through the ice layer.</p>
<p>Navigating a Detour</p>
<p>Shipowner Li observed the situation. Monkey Reef was piled high with ice like a mountain, and Laotieshan (Rean Ti Shan Pron at Hs.) had also become an ice-covered sea. The Yantai route was cut off. Therefore, he changed the route and headed to Dalian, making a large detour, before heading to Yantai, in order to safely return to Shanghai. However, there were still ice floes between Yantai and Weihaiwei, up to one or two feet thick, floating on the sea. Therefore, the Yu Shun's voyage was still arduous. Upon arriving in Shanghai today and entering the Songkou port, the crew members were overjoyed to see their hometown again.</p>
<p>Entering the Dock Today</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shanghai, shipowner Li Zhenqu submitted a detailed report on the encounter with the ice to the General Bureau yesterday afternoon. Mr. Li told reporters that the Shanghai-Tianjin route is currently still difficult to navigate directly. Ships going to Tianjin must not travel via Monkey Reef and must take a detour. The Bureau decided to temporarily suspend the Yu Shun's operations due to concerns about ice damage to the hull, and it will enter the dock for inspection and repairs today. Insurance companies will also be notified to send ship surveyors to inspect the ship. Mr. Li said that the coldest temperature in Dagu was twenty-four degrees below the freezing point. The Yu Shun burned two furnaces continuously, but the water bucket next to the furnace was still frozen solid, which shows the severity of the cold.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Fu Tai Timber Firm and Others Accuse Li Shaobin; Investigating Official Adjourns Hearing for Further Inquiry <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Fu Tai and other timber firms on Guangfu Road in Zhabei have recently been involved in a dispute over house tax materials. The timber industry association once staged a strike, which was mediated by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The previous report detailed these events. It is now known that Chen Hongzhang, manager of Fu Tai Timber Firm, and Huang Xingsheng, manager of Yuan Xing Timber Firm, have engaged lawyer Xu Zuoliang to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the District Court, accusing Li Shaobin, director of the North Shanghai Inspection Office of the Finance Bureau, of abusing his authority and obstructing freedom. The accusation states that Li Shaobin knowingly imposed forced collection of donations when they should not have been collected. The accusation states that Chen Hongzhang, manager of Fu Tai Timber Firm, was assessed by Li Shaobin, director of the North Shanghai Inspection Office, for house tax of 50 yuan per quarter in the 23rd year and 85 yuan per quarter in the 24th year, and was ordered to pay a supplementary donation of 407 yuan and 68 cents, as well as a fine of 81 yuan and 54 cents. Chen Hongzhang felt that the tax on horses and houses was too high and unaffordable. Upon inquiring, he learned that more than ten companies in the same industry were suffering from the heavy tax burden. He requested the Shanghai Timber Industry Association to negotiate with the Municipal Finance Bureau. While the petition was in progress, Chen Qizhang was suddenly summoned by the police on the 3rd of this month at 12:00 PM to the office and detained for failing to pay. He was released on bail on the afternoon of the 4th after the Timber Industry Association intervened. Huang Xingsheng, the agent of Yuan Xing Timber Firm, was assessed based on the unilaterally determined recent rental price of the North Shanghai Inspection Office, calculating the house tax at 14 percent, resulting in a tax of 462 yuan, plus a 20 percent fine of 92 yuan and 40 cents. The defendant is now forcibly collecting donations and fines totaling a huge sum of 902 yuan, 1 dime and 6 cents, as evidenced by receipts, and forced the plaintiffs to sign a voluntary document promising to pay the donations. The recent rental price of the Fu Tai Timber Firm, which Chen Qizhang represents, is calculated at 198 yuan per month, resulting in an annual donation of 330 yuan, 9 dimes and 1 cent. The defendant is now forcibly collecting donations and fines totaling 489 yuan, 2 dimes and 2 cents. The defendant intentionally imposed forced collection in violation of Article 5 of the Regulations for Investigating House Rentals, and the defendant should be found guilty of violating Articles 129 and 302 of the Criminal Law. After receiving the accusation, the court held a hearing yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the Criminal Court No. 12, presided over by Judge Lu Hongyi. Chen Qizhang testified that he was 27 years old, from Ningbo. On the 3rd of this month, at 12:00 PM, the police took him to the collection office, and at 6:00 PM, he was transferred to the Second Precinct of the Fourth District Police Station for overnight detention. The next day, he was transferred to the North Station Branch Bureau, and at 1:00 PM, he was released on bail after being sent to the General Bureau. The defendant abused his authority and detained his body for 28 hours, depriving him of his freedom of movement. He requested that the law be thoroughly investigated. Li Shaobin testified that he was 47 years old, from Yunnan, and served as the director of the Zhabei Collection Office. The Guangfu Road Fu Tai Timber Firm concealed the value of the leased land, falsely claiming to own the property, and reported 50 yuan per quarter for land and house tax. After the Municipal Finance Bureau sent personnel to investigate, it was found that the timber firm's land, storage, etc., were actually leased from others, with an annual rental price of 2,000 yuan, and four houses were built on the land, valued at 8 yuan each. Therefore, the timber firm should pay a total of 407 yuan, 6 dimes and 8 cents for land and house tax, plus a fine of 81 yuan, 5 dimes and 4 cents. Collection had been unsuccessful despite repeated attempts, so he handled it in accordance with the regulations, and there was nothing improper. He was asked whether he had gone to assess the value. He replied that the Finance Bureau had sent personnel to conduct an on-site inspection. He was asked whether the pursuit of fines was his idea. He replied that it was not, and that he was executing orders. The questioning was adjourned for further inquiry as it was late.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun," Nishiyama Toshihiko, from Nishi Awara Village, Ibo County, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, is currently a clerk at Takeuchi Print Shop at No. 304 Haining Road in Shanghai. At 4:40 AM on the 15th, he bought a package of chocolate candy worth 2 dimes from the North Wanfeng Chinese cigarette and paper shop at No. 499 North Sichuan Road. After the shop assistant, Zhang Wenzhong, handed him the candy, he asked him to pay. Unexpectedly, Nishiyama claimed that he had already paid and tried to leave with the candy. Zhang accused him of cheating and asked him to return the candy. Nishiyama became violent and slapped Zhang's cheek. The two began to argue loudly. A police officer from the Public Security Bureau, who was stationed nearby, saw the commotion and tried to mediate. To everyone's surprise, Nishiyama also tried to attack the police officer. The police officer had no choice but to take him to the Public Security Bureau and hand him over to the Japanese Consulate Police Station. It was discovered that Nishiyama had previously stabbed a Chinese person with a kitchen knife at a Chinese restaurant on Avenue Joffre, and had repeatedly committed illegal acts. Therefore, the Japanese Police Station will impose a severe punishment on him.</p>

<p>Lin Di, the eleven-year-old niece of Ye Zhengqi, a native of Anqing living at No. 9, Alley 80, Route Frelupt, was playing at the entrance of the alley at around 2 PM the day before yesterday. A woman named Li Wangshi (47 years old, native of Anhui, living at No. 59 on the same road) tricked her into going to the theater by hiring a rickshaw. Unexpectedly, while traveling to the entrance of Hengqing Alley on Route Paul Beau, Ye Zhengqi and his friend Xu Wenbin happened to pass by and saw her. Wondering why his niece was riding in a rickshaw with an unfamiliar woman, he immediately stopped them to inquire. Unexpectedly, the woman dared to impersonate the girl's mother, claiming, "I'm taking my own daughter out for a stroll. What does it have to do with you?" At this point, the abduction was discovered. They grabbed and restrained the woman. Shen Xianxi, a constable, arrived and took Li Wangshi and the girl to the police station. After questioning by the detective, Wangshi confessed to the attempted abduction. Lin Di said that the woman had given her a bag of fruit one day and asked her to wait for her at the entrance of the alley again today, preparing to go to the theater together. She didn't know it was an abduction. Yesterday afternoon, Wangshi was sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division One. The police station's lawyer requested a postponement to investigate whether the defendant had committed any other crimes. Judge Wang approved the postponement and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Granddaughter Disputes Inheritance <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The late Inspector Ji Sheng of the French Police Station, who lived at No. 14 Pingjihe Road in the French Concession, owned a self-built house. In his later years, he adopted Gu Weiyi as his only son due to a lack of descendants. Therefore, all of Ji Sheng's inheritance was received by Gu Weiyi. Recently, Gao Rong Qiaolin, the 35-year-old granddaughter of Ji Sheng (native of Cixi, Zhejiang), engaged lawyer Xu Zuyan to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court, Civil Division, to confirm that the plaintiff Rong Qiaolin has the right to inherit. The application for litigation assistance has been approved by the court. Yesterday, the court summoned the parties. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff is the granddaughter of Gu Jisheng's eldest daughter, married to Gao Yongquan. Gu Jisheng passed away on the 13th day of the eighth month of the old calendar last year. According to the Civil Code, inheritance naturally begins. It has been found that the total value of the grandfather's inheritance is three to four hundred thousand yuan. The plaintiff's mother is the biological daughter of the grandfather Gu Jisheng. The defendant, Gu Weiyi, is the adopted son of the grandfather Gu Jisheng. According to law, the adopted son should receive one-third of the property, and the plaintiff should receive two-thirds. Secondly, the plaintiff and her husband are poor and unable to pay the litigation costs, so they should be granted litigation assistance. The defendant Gu Weiyi's lawyer, Wang Henggu, stated that the plaintiff had filed a lawsuit in this case in February last year. At that time, Chen Sanlin, Wang Wenkui, and the lawyers for both parties, Hu Jue and Suan Yaoxian, mediated a settlement, whereby the defendant Gu Weiyi paid Rong Qiaolin 23,000 yuan to resolve the matter. A settlement agreement was signed, completely waiving all rights of the parties and stating that no further disputes would arise. The agreement was signed on February 21st, and the case was dismissed on the 22nd. How can the plaintiff now file a lawsuit again? Furthermore, the defendant paid the plaintiff 23,000 yuan at that time, which was a substantial amount. Why is it necessary to apply to this court for litigation assistance? The plaintiff's claim should be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer further stated that although the plaintiff received a large sum of money at that time, she had many debts and had to repay them, so she now has nothing left. The settlement agreement signed by both parties did not state that she waived her right to inheritance. Judge Ma Yishu concluded the debate and ruled in court that the plaintiff's litigation assistance was approved.</p>

<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Wu Yefu, a teacher at Yucai Public School on Shanhai Pass Road in the Public Concession, was repeatedly threatened by bandits. He had no choice but to report it to the school authorities. The Western principal notified the police station by telephone and submitted a written application requesting a thorough investigation. The police station dispatched Chinese detective Wu Changkai and Western detective Kai Naitai to investigate. On the afternoon of the 13th at 8:00 PM, Zhou Erda (native of Wuxi), a bandit who was making contact, was arrested on the spot near Jiangyuan Lane. On the morning of the 14th, he was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. He confessed that Song Shengda and Liu Linsheng were still at large. A reporter from Shen Shi News Agency visited the school teacher Wu Yefu yesterday morning to inquire about the details. Mr. Wu was in class and unavailable, so a colleague from the school came out to greet the reporter and provided information. It is recorded below. Wu Yefu is from Jiangyin County and is not from a wealthy family. He only earns a monthly salary to cover his expenses in Shanghai, so he is unlikely to be a target for threats and kidnapping. It is probably due to unsuccessful borrowing. However, the school authorities believe that because the school is directly under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department, the bandits are too daring. Therefore, the Western principal was furious. In addition to requesting the police station to thoroughly pursue the accomplices and clarify the truth, he also requested to dispatch additional undercover detectives to protect Mr. Wu's safety on his journey to prevent accidents. It is expected that the case will be fully resolved in the near future.</p>

<p>The Ji Ren Assistance Association in Shanghai provides coffins worth 20 yuan, as well as lime, charcoal ash, and carrying fees to poor and underprivileged compatriots who cannot afford coffins and burials. It avoids the form of charity in its implementation and has a history of eighteen years. Since Mr. Shao Ruxin resumed his duties, he has actively reorganized and expanded the association. The first members' dinner was held at Gongdelin on the evening of the 15th, and the association's affairs were reported. More than 100 male and female members attended, including Li Linshu, Lu Guanhong, Wu Renbao, Liu Yan, Yang Senshan, Fei Shaojin, and Ms. Zhou Ruiying. Chairman Shao Ruxin began by reporting that it is quite difficult to run a charity in the midst of the current economic downturn. It is proposed to change the funding of the recognized expenses as follows: Regular expenses will be borne by the board of directors separately. The cost of materials will be borne by the members, with one thousand people forming a team to assist in providing materials for one coffin. The cost of materials, including charcoal ash, lime, and carrying fees, totals 25 yuan. Therefore, each member only needs to contribute 2.5 cents, and one thousand people contribute 25 yuan. If one coffin is replaced, there will never be a shortage in the basic 400 coffins. Member recognition is easy and effortless. Special expenses are reserved for expanding the material production field and the public cemetery, and will be collected separately. No donations will be solicited from outside. The new regulations will be printed and sent to all members to solicit opinions and convene a meeting at a fixed time for public decision-making and implementation. A dinner was then held, and the event ended at 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>Wang Wenan, a 24-year-old Wuxi native residing at 655 Huishan Road, and currently working as an artist at the Universal Film Company on Fuzhou Road, was riding his bicycle with friends Wang Acai, Hua Shouxing, and others around 7 AM the day before, planning to go to New Shanghai for recreation. As they traveled west to east near the intersection of Huade Road and Meizhou Road, a No. 15050 Route Ten public bus driven by Sun Aqing came speeding from behind. Unable to brake in time, the front left wheel collided with the rear wheel of Wang Wenan's bicycle, causing him to fall to the ground, suffering severe head injuries and dying shortly thereafter. Police arrived after being notified and instructed detectives Zhang Tieshan and others from the Yangshupu Police Station to inspect the scene. The body was then taken to the autopsy room on Feitoul Road. The First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zujing, to examine the body the day before. Detective Zhang first reported the circumstances, and Sun Aqing stated that he had been a public bus driver for three years. He claimed that his bus was initially ahead of the deceased, but the deceased suddenly overtook him. At that moment, another vehicle was approaching from the opposite direction, and the deceased swerved left in front of his bus to avoid it, making it impossible for him to brake, resulting in the collision. Wang Acai testified that he was riding in the lead, Hua Shouxing was second, and the deceased was behind Hua. All three of them were in front of the bus when it sped up from behind without honking the horn and hit the deceased. He also said there were no cars coming from the opposite direction. Hua Shouxing testified that he heard the crash and looked back, seeing that the bus did not immediately stop. His testimony was similar to Wang Acai's. After taking the statements, Zhang concluded that Wang Wenan, male, died from a head injury sustained after being struck by the No. 15050 Route Ten public bus. The body was released to his brother Wang Wei for burial after signing an undertaking. The police will investigate whether bus driver Sun Aqing was negligent.</p>

<p>The robbers Li Yizhi, also known as Li Zhuizi and Li Zhongxin (24 years old, residing at No. 126 Xiaoshadu Road), Ding Anzhen, also known as Wang Shaoqing (31 years old, residing at No. 51 Hede Road), and Xia San (33 years old, residing in a shack near the Dayang Bridge in Zhabei), robbed Sun Zikuan, the owner of the Guangda Pawnshop at No. 172 Bai'er Road in the French Concession, of 6,000 yuan in cash around 10 PM on October 14th last year, and fled with the loot. In July, these robbers committed a crime in the International Settlement and were arrested and sent to the First Court, where they were sentenced. Later, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that Li and others had committed murder in the Chinese area and sent an official letter to extradite them to the mainland court for trial. The French police learned of this and ordered detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, and Bao-detective Zuo Qihong to go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to take the above-mentioned criminals to the French police station.

<p>Ni Heshang from Tongzhou, residing at No. 32 Gui'an Lane, Senyin Road in the South City, sneaked into Dean Lane, Pengpu Road in Yangshupu around 3 PM on November 10th last year and lured Wang Liu's five-year-old son, Gengsheng, from the same hometown, to his father Ni Siyuan's home in Zhangxing Town, Laohong Port in his hometown. He then falsely claimed to Wang Liu that her son had been kidnapped by Ni Futang and that she would have to pay 40 yuan to get him back. Wang Liu realized he was behind it and pretended to agree to raise the money, secretly following him to Gui'an Lane. She learned the truth from Ni Futang and reported to the Yulin Road Police Station. Detective Li Hongsheng was secretly dispatched, together with the police officers from the Public Security Bureau in charge, and arrested him at the address and brought him back to the police station. He was sent to the First Special District Court. He was evasive in his confession and was detained. The day before, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. The Public Security Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that Wang Liu had appeared in court to testify and proved that she had gone to the defendant's home in Zhangxing Town, Laohong Port, Tongzhou, and saw her son, Gengsheng, crying and calling for his mother. She intended to take him back to Shanghai, but his father accused her of being a kidnapper and went with her to the local police station. She explained the situation, but she was unable to bring Gengsheng back and had to return to Shanghai. She and the defendant used to live in the same neighborhood near Laoximen, he was a coppersmith, and they were neighbors with no improper relationship. After her husband passed away last spring, he left her son, Gengsheng, and others. When questioned, the defendant insisted that he had known her for years and admitted to taking the child to his hometown to be raised by his father Ni Siyuan. He admitted that he wanted to extort 40 yuan from her to bring the child back. Judge Jiang ordered a postponement and will send a letter to the Nantong Local Court to bring Wang's child Gengsheng to Shanghai for collection and further verification.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Thief From Job Loss <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>There are three entrances to the Customs Building on the Bund, Hankou Road, with many people entering and exiting every day. Therefore, some criminals take the opportunity to openly engage in fraud and theft in public. Cases like this are not uncommon. In the middle of last month, a Cantonese swindler was caught on the spot, pretending to be a customs officer purchasing goods and defrauding a Cantonese store on North Sichuan Road of Chinese sausage, squid, milk, abalone, and salted fish, totaling more than 16 or 17 yuan. Both the person and the stolen goods were sent to the local court by the Water Police Station for trial. Last Saturday, two theft cases occurred in succession. One was the theft of a coat belonging to a customs officer, the thief escaping without a trace. At 11 AM, a local named Xu Jiaquan stole the documentation from the bicycle of an apprentice customs broker sent by Yicheng Customs Brokerage. The apprentice discovered the theft and gave chase. The thief fled to the entrance, where he was stopped by an employee of the Yuegong Motor Company. He was taken back to the police station by the Chinese police officer on duty at the Customs and sent to the local court the day before yesterday. At noon yesterday, a neatly dressed young man sneaked into the secretary's office on the third floor of the Customs building. While the Western staff was out for lunch, he pretended to be looking for a friend. In a split second, he took a Western employee's yellow wool coat and tried to escape. He was discovered early by the Western staff and apprehended with the stolen goods. He was identified as Zhang Desheng, 23 years old, from Ningbo, who had worked in the document review department of a bank in Nanjing and had also worked as a ticket seller for the Jinpu Railway Bureau. After losing his job, he resorted to theft to make a living. He also confessed that he had robbed a moviegoer of a wallet at the Xinguang Grand Theater in Shanghai and was arrested on the spot. He was sent to the First Special Court by the Laozha Police Station and sentenced to one year and six months in prison. The Water Police Station detectives, fearing that he had committed other crimes and noting that he looked about 27 or 28 years old and spoke fluently, took his fingerprints and sent them to the Chinese settlement police agencies for verification before handling the case according to law.</p>

<p>The Sanhe Lou restaurant on West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession was established by merchant Xu Fuchu many years ago.

Now, another Sanhe Lou branch will open in the building west of the Great World on Mintiniyin Road. The location is larger than the old location, the layout is extremely luxurious, and the prices are kept low. In addition to the original Tianjin and Hebei cuisine, a Sichuan flavor has been added.

<h3 id="e133">Lawsuit Over Detained 10,000 Yuan Deposit: Scheduled for Sentencing <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Han Yulin, manager of the Pingyuan Coal Sales Agency, and Li Shencang, residing at No. 8 Fen'an Lane, West Huade Road, entered into a coal transportation contract on August 4th of the year before last. The contract stipulated that Li would transport the coal from the agency and would provide a deposit of 10,000 yuan. Di Yiping, under the name of Houming, deposited the money in the savings department of the China Industrial Bank, with both Li and Han's seals affixed to the deposit. In the future, the money could only be withdrawn with the joint seals of Li, Han, and Di. Li kept the savings passbook. After signing the contract, a year passed, and Pinghou did not deliver any coal to Li for transportation. After Li negotiated with Han, they decided to cancel the contract. Li then took the passbook to the China Industrial Bank to withdraw the deposit, but the bank, at the request of Western doctor Niu Huilin, refused to pay. It turned out that Pinghou Coal Sales Agency had asked Dr. Niu to act as a guarantor and had a credit line with the business department of the China Industrial Bank. They owed the bank 10,300 yuan and had been repeatedly urged to pay. Pinghou could not repay the debt, so they turned to Dr. Niu to fulfill his guarantor duties. Dr. Niu, fearing financial loss, learned from an employee of Pinghou surnamed Wu that there was another 10,000 yuan deposit in the bank. He immediately sent a letter requesting that the deposit be used to offset the debt, causing Li Shencang to not receive a single penny. Therefore, Li filed a lawsuit against Shen Guangyan, the person in charge of savings at the bank, requesting an order to return the deposit and pay the interest. Han Yulin, the manager of Pinghou, sympathized with Li and joined the lawsuit. Niu Huilin sympathized with the China Industrial Bank and also joined the lawsuit. It seemed that both parties had assistants. The First Special District Court concluded the first trial and ruled against Li Shencang, determining that the ownership of the deposit had belonged to Pinghou and allowing the defendant to deduct it from Pinghou's debt. Li, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating reasons and requesting the original judgment be overturned. Both sides' participants still maintained their old interests and positions. Yesterday afternoon, the Second Branch of the High Court convened a collegial panel for trial. First, Jiang Yiping, the attorney for appellant Li Zhongcang, argued that the issue in the case was the ownership of the 10,000 yuan deposit. The appellant believed that the ownership of the money had not been transferred to Pinghou. Although the deposit slip was in Pinghou's name, it still bore the seals of both Li Shencang and Han Yulin. Since the coal transportation contract was signed through legal procedures and Pinghou could not fulfill the contract, the deposit should be returned. How could it be used to offset Pinghou's debt? The China Industrial Bank initially had no intention of offsetting the debt. It only did so after being entrusted by Niu. Bank practices place the most importance on seals on deposit slips. Li and Pinghou had no relationship. That the money was deposited in Pinghou's name with his seal and Han's joint seal should have been known to the bank from the start. This proves that it was a conditional deposit. Niu was a guarantor for other debts of Pinghou. The bank could demand repayment from Pinghou and Niu separately. It should not confuse right and wrong. Therefore, he dared not say that the intentions of the bank and Dr. Niu were pure. Thus, he appealed. Subsequently, the attorney for the appellee, Wang Fuchang, and the attorney for Niu Huilin rebutted, stating that the deposit slip clearly stated that the depositor was Pinghou, so the money belonged to Pinghou. Although Li and Han's seals were affixed, they were affixed under Pinghou's name. The format of the seal was like the seal of the court on a document below the court's official seal. It cannot be considered that the seal implies that the person who put the seal on is the depositor. Judge Han then declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the afternoon of the 21st of this month.</p>

<p>Yang Chengde, a 34-year-old native of Chongming, residing at No. 110 Sanpailou, has recently been buying silver coins for legal tender, paying a premium of three or four cents per yuan. At 8:10 AM the day before, he was caught with 253.8 yuan in legal tender, buying six yuan in silver coins at No. 69 Yuezhong Guixiang Powder Store on Fangbin Road, paying a premium of three cents per yuan. Store clerk Du Junxiong questioned him about why he was buying silver coins. Yang stammered and could not explain.

<p>Charlie Chaplin Praises Red Lotus Temple: Comedic film star Charlie Chaplin, during his recent visit to Shanghai, heard of the fame of the Red Lotus Temple at the Gong Stage and requested Mr. Chrysler, the Shanghai representative of United Artists, to ask Mr. Gui Huantang, the manager of the Carlton Cinema, to accompany him. Mr. Chaplin, seeing this new type of Peking Opera, was indescribably excited. He praised the scene where Ramu Lian changed fourteen sets, saying that although this kind of (dark transformation) is very popular on European and American stages, there has never been such a large number of transformations. He was amazed by the actors' somersaults, whirling swallows, and the ups and downs of their singing, considering them to be stage innovations and wanting to study them. Mr. Chaplin intended to watch the entire play to explore a shortcut to Chinese stage plays, but his journey was hasty, and he had to depart the next night and had other appointments, so he could not see the whole picture. Before leaving, he was reluctant to leave and wanted to see the Red Lotus Temple at the Gong Stage again when he returned to Shanghai from his southern tour. The only film artist of today expresses his warm sympathy for Red Lotus Temple, which proves that the play's content has considerable value.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaozhong Visits Tianjia Mountain to Film "Dream Tour of Peach Blossom Garden" Exterior Scenes: After Shi Dongshan completed "Song of Everlasting Regret" for Xinhua Film Company, manager Zhang Shankun wanted to plan to produce a thought-provoking and interesting sound film, but as there was no suitable talent at the time, the matter was put on hold. Later, Han Langen and Liu Jiqun heard about it and volunteered, telling him about their experience in performing comedy. Mr. Zhang was very happy and asked the senior director Yang Xiaozhong to study the script of "Dream Tour of Peach Blossom Garden," which he had written himself. Mr. Yang greatly praised it after reading it and immediately sent it to the Nanjing Review Board for review. It is said that the review board also gave the play considerable praise. Mr. Zhang then resolutely signed a formal contract with the two humorous Mingwus. Because the Peach Blossom Garden in the play is a dreamland and requires a scenic area with clear mountains and rivers and few people, which Wu Ze does not fit, he specially sent people to explore the mountainous areas of Zhejiang Province. As a result, the area near Tianmu Mountain was considered the most suitable. Director Yang also went to survey it himself, and saw that the scenery there was not only secluded. According to Xinhua people, "Dream Tour of Peach Blossom Garden" began filming yesterday.</p>
<p>Tong Yuejuan Returns to Gong Stage: The fourth episode of Red Lotus Temple at the Gong Stage premiered last Friday. The scenery is more magnificent than the previous episodes, and the last scene uses all glass, which cost a lot of money. New costumes have also been added, and even the hats and clothes of the extras are designed to be novel. In terms of actors, in addition to famous actors, the famous Kunling Tong Yuejuan was also invited to play Yang Yinan, because this role emphasizes both literary and martial arts, and Ms. Tong is most suitable to play it. She was originally the pillar of the stage, but she left the stage because Xinhua Film Company wanted to invite Tong to play an important role in the film Peach Blossom Fan. Now she has returned to Hong. It is also the premiere of the fourth episode, and the audience is becoming more and more crowded.</p>

<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>Sent from Guangzhou</p>
<p>China's Greatest Southern University</p>
<p>On the second day of arriving in Guangdong, I was invited by President Zou Haibin to visit the National Sun Yat-sen University, which he runs. Mr. Zou first briefly described the history of the school to his colleagues. The school was founded in the spring of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen ordered Mr. Zou to merge and reorganize the National Guangdong Higher Teachers College, the Guangdong Public Law College, and the Public Agricultural College, establishing four departments of liberal arts, sciences, law, and agriculture. Later, he took over the Public Medical College and added a medical department. Mr. Sun Yat-sen believed that the original school buildings were scattered in the urban area, which was not suitable for factory repairs and difficult to develop. He asked Mr. Zou to choose Shipai as the new school site. Construction began in March of the 22nd year, and both phases of the project were completed in thirty months. The five colleges of agriculture, engineering, law, liberal arts, and sciences have all moved in one after another. There are currently more than 2,000 students, with females accounting for one-tenth. The situation is that Baiyun Mountain surrounds it and the Pearl River surrounds it. The area inside the school has undulating hills and rippling ponds. The areas are divided and named after the provinces of our country. In addition, the hills and pools in each area are named after the mountains, rivers, and lakes in the provinces. The entire school covers an area of 30,000 acres. Except for the buildings, all are farmland. Each college and dormitory has room for expansion. The fruit tree plan is long-term. There are currently 4.5 million trees planted. After three or four years, 500,000 trees will mature first. If each tree is valued at one yuan per year, then 500,000 yuan can be obtained annually. After ten years, all 4.5 million trees will be profitable, and 4.5 million yuan can be obtained. Mr. Zou said that the school wants to make the education that has always been consumptive into productive education. His intentions are profound. Foreigners who come here all consider it to be China's cultural city. A certain Japanese ambassador visited the school and was able to complete such a large-scale school building in a short period of time with 500,000 yuan. The Japanese were amazed by the cost savings, the speed of the project, and the greatness of the scale. The achievements of each college have their own characteristics, such as the agricultural college's rice crop improvement and silkworm experiments. The law college has an economic survey office to investigate farmers' lives and price indexes, and a public legal advisory office to provide free legal advice to the people. The engineering college pays attention to practical training, with fifteen or sixteen hours of practical training each week. President Zou said that the school is thinking about self-reliance and economic independence in the future. In eight or ten years, it can survive even if the doors are closed. The current plan to plant fruit trees has been realized, and vegetables, pig farming, chicken farming, and cattle farming are being implemented. In the future, everything can be achieved without problems, except for coal and salt, which cannot be self-sufficient. For national crisis education, military training and air defense exercises are given the same attention, and many of the courses have been changed. I highly praised the greatness of the school's architecture. Mr. Zou said that he really has three fears here. The magnificent school building is used to enrich its brilliance, promote learning, and contribute to the country and society. If there is only material and no spirit, it is a waste of national funds and a waste of people's resources. That is one fear. The suitability of the school building is for students to easily hide and cultivate themselves. If they are content with comfort, they will not be able to endure hardship in the future. Even those who come from the fields will not be able to return to the fields, then the establishment of this school is no different from training disabled people. That is the second fear. A large amount of planting is for productive education, or they may not cherish it and destroy it, or the management may not be good and the income may not be as expected. Not only will the productive education not be completed in the future, but people will regard production as a daunting task. That is the third fear. Mr. Zou's words are very respectable. I said that this school will make education and industry into one piece. The technical talents recently created are all used locally, which is valuable. Our visit to the highest university in the south took four hours. The north and south are hundreds of miles apart. If it were not for using a car, I am afraid that it would not be possible to complete the visit in two or three days. Dr. Zheng Yanfen, Dean of the Law School, served in the League of Nations for many years. When he returned to China the year before last, Ambassador Gu Shaochuan prepared a letter of introduction to me. I was not able to meet him when I went to Jiangxi. I did not expect to meet him here today. He told me in great detail about the content of the school. I will write another article about it when I have time.</p>

<p>— (Qian Shan)</p>
<p>"Talk big, spend little money" is a proverb from the old capital. For example, one "diao" (a string of cash) means ten copper coins, or five twenty-copper coins. Five hundred "qian" or "wen" means only five ten-copper coins. However, in Shandong and other provinces, it is the opposite. One "diao" means one hundred ten-copper coins. This may be based on the old-fashioned coins. I recall that when I was in Beijing more than ten years ago, there were many small copper coins made to represent paper money, with red copper representing five "wen," red copper representing two "wen," and yellow copper representing one "wen," and the texture was very fine. At that time, one or two "wen" of small copper coins could really buy some scallions, ginger, pepper, and garlic as ingredients, and five "wen" could prepare oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar for seasoning! Such a small expense felt interesting even just mentioning it, let alone when beggars came to the door asking for alms, just one small copper coin would send them away. Even if you sent away ten beggars a day, it would cost one copper coin! Thinking about it now, it is very funny!</p>

<p>— Xie Zhongwen</p>
<p>If London is the city of fog, then Beijing should be considered the city of gray. Just like the density and dirtiness of the gray, my impression of Beijing is deep and clear. But the most unforgettable thing for me is gray.</p>
<p>In Beijing, whether going out or staying at home, gray entangled me everywhere. On the road it flew into my ears and nose, and as soon as I entered the hutong, it would bury my instep. Even in the house, it would slip in through the cracks in the windows and scatter on the tables, chairs, beds, and books. Even the White Pagoda towering in Beihai Park, the magnificent Forbidden City, and the crystal clear Kunming Lake all had to be sprinkled with a layer of subtle decolorizer. Gray floated to every place I went, and gray also squeezed into every corner of Beijing.</p>
<p>This ancient northern country is so full of gray, gray, gray. Maybe it is gray, this dirty thing, that makes the northern country age? But it once seduced the eyes of tourists!</p>
<p>Gray not only enveloped the entire outline of Beijing, but also penetrated its core, making everything alive in its embrace dizzy, numb, and lazy!</p>
<p>I saw skinny donkeys and camels carrying charcoal, half-opening their eyes and walking slowly. I saw big carts loaded with tall straw, with carters lying on the straw napping. I saw idlers carrying birdcages and strolling around the Temple of the Emperors morning and evening. I saw apartments, restaurants, ballrooms, and movie theaters packed with students rushing to join the fun. I saw many wandering souls who had lost their vitality. I saw the gray on the soul of Beijing!</p>
<p>This indelible gray on the soul is increasing its accumulation, and one day it will submerge this ancient northern country, right? Cursable gray!</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Cellar of Beijing <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Yesterday I received a letter from my old friend Mr. Huang, who came from Hebei, detailing the cellars of Beijing. I transcribe it as follows to share with readers:</p>
<p>The northern land is severely cold. Once winter arrives, the climate is harsh, the ground has no green grass, and among the crops that can overwinter in the ground, only wheat seedlings exist, but their leaves are also frozen and brittle. As for vegetables and fruits, in this period, it can be said that all traces have disappeared from the fields. It was my first time traveling to the north for the winter, and seeing this situation, I was initially worried about the disruption of the winter vegetable supply. However, since winter began, the cook has continued to serve them daily, and I have long forgotten about it. At the end of the twelfth month, I wanted to see what the northern customs were like for the Lunar New Year, so I bravely ventured into the city despite the cold (because I am afraid of the cold, I have been indoors by the stove all day since winter began and have never entered the city). I saw fresh vegetables filling the market. Vendors were carrying them in carts and on their shoulders, hawking along the streets. Not only were all kinds of vegetables that had disappeared from the fields readily available, but even fresh fruits such as watermelons, cucumbers, grapes, persimmons, and pears, which ripen in summer and autumn, were available for purchase. I tried buying them and eating them, and I felt that their color, aroma, and crispness were no different from those picked from the branches and harvested from the fields. They were not like Liu Ji's oranges, dry as worn-out wadding, so I couldn't help but be suspicious. Then I questioned the locals and learned that the common people had a special method of long-term storage. The method is very simple: the farmers here choose a gap in their courtyards, dig a well with a diameter of about three feet, and a depth of more than ten feet, and then dig horizontally to create an earth room. The width of the room varies depending on the amount of stored goods. The larger ones need to be supported by thick boards and wooden pillars to prevent collapse. There is a ladder inside for people to ascend and descend, and a rope is used to lower things in and out. The wellhead is often covered with wooden boards to prevent air circulation, and then covered with dry grass, two or three feet thick, which is called a "cellar," pronounced like "jiao" in the northern language. Usually, when farmers have a harvest, they put anything they want to keep fresh in it after picking it. Once winter arrives, they take all that is in the fields and store it in the cellar. After that, they take it out to eat as needed, and it does not change its freshness for a long time. If properly stored, the life of vegetables and fruits can be extended for a year in the cellar, awaiting the transfer of new and old crops. And the original color, aroma, sweetness, and crispness do not change at all. This kind of cellar is extremely common in North China. Except for cities, almost every household in the countryside has one. But it is still questionable whether we can imitate this in the south. Because the soil layer in the south is thin and the water table is close, digging can easily turn into a water well. If there is no such concern, then the reputation of fruits in the south will definitely be far superior to canned fresh vegetables. Because today's so-called canned fruits have been scientifically processed, and cannot be compared with the old-fashioned candied fruits, but in fact, the color, aroma, sweetness, and crispness of canned fruits have all been lost. They must be cooked and put into cans, which is similar to the method of making candied fruits. The only difference is the addition of a can. Therefore, instead of calling them canned fresh fruits, it is more accurate to call them canned candied fruits. If the northern method of cellar storage can be promoted in the south, I know that the value of cellar products will definitely surpass that of canned products.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Four: Heavy Profit, Beautiful Woman, Mercenary Husband Reluctantly Loves; Lofty Ambitions, Strong Feet, Robust Man Flees into Wilderness</p>
<p>Li Shilian reached into his arms, seemingly fumbling for the manuscript in his arms, then raised his hand again and scratched his hair a few times, and then answered with a smile: Rather than waiting here at Mr. Cheng's place, and disturbing Mr. Cheng, I might as well wait for Mr. Wang in my own house, so I can have a pleasant chat. Zhiqian smiled and said: If Bei Hai comes, I will definitely ask him to visit you. But I have a word outside of the topic to tell you. I know Wang Beihai's temper. He is a young man after all. If you want him to help, just ask him to help. As long as it is within reason, I don't think he will refuse. But you must not use something as leverage to move him, as an exchange condition. Li Shilian could not help but blush when he heard these words. He also pulled on his lapels a couple of times, as if Zhiqian's words had touched a sore spot. Li Shilian smiled and said: My report is like this. But if you want to be a matchmaker, that is your good intention. Whether Bei Hai accepts it or not is another matter. But if you don't put these two things together, I think Bei Hai will definitely not blame you. Although a look of hesitation constantly appeared on Li Shilian's face, he quietly listened to Zhiqian's words. After he finished speaking, he stood up and cupped his hands and smiled: I understand, I understand. In the future, when things are successful, everyone will ask Mr. Cheng to have a drink. After finishing, he left happily with a smile. Zhiqian walked around the room for a while, and then wrote a note and put it on the table. It said: Brother Bei Hai is here, quickly go to Mr. Li Shilian's house to negotiate something. He himself half-closed the door and came to sit idly in Zhou Yourong's room in front. There were two other people in suits sitting in his room. Judging by their clothes, although they were dark blue, they had a layer of non-red or yellow color on the outside. It was clear that they were used to running around on the mainland, covered with a layer of dust. Zhou Yourong stood up first and smiled: I was just planning to ask you to come, and you came, that's great. He introduced the two of them, saying that one was Guo Zhuoran, the head of the Western Travel Group, and the other was Cheng Shigong, the deputy head of the group. Mr. Guo had a slightly pointed face, and his cheeks were covered with short beard. Because the beard was also a yellowish-red color, it seemed that it was also covered with dust. However, next to his high nose bridge, his two sparkling eyes could very well represent his adventurous spirit. (416)</p>

<p>— Fire</p>
<p>Lying in bed. No home, no soul; because being caught under the huge gears, would it allow you to think? So, in order to still live; very simply, I only want to open my tired eyelids a little more like a... grub. So, a light dream embraces the aching waist, in the tearful night. Even if strange and bizarre, it is joyful, nostalgic, for the stimulation that is not found in the world.</p>
<p>I will step into the realm I hope for, suddenly!</p>
<p>As if being in the hometown I had been separated from for seven years, now with only a hair's breadth of distance, finally imprinted on the lingering and confused eardrums, this first sound with the smell of sulfur... the sound of gunfire.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes does not seem necessary, anyway, it is a piece of moaning, crying, no! no! like the hoot of an owl heard in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Paper money, illuminated by the green of the electric flower, is like a will-o'-the-wisp; if there were no choking sounds, I would suspect that I had already been sleeping in a stone tomb.</p>
<p>"Our people from the Northeast should kowtow facing the Northeast."</p>
<p>"Yes! Light a candle."</p>
<p>"I'll stand in the middle!"</p>
<p>So, they set off firecrackers, and then I remembered that it was New Year's Eve. So, I remembered that Chahar East was again a local issue. So, deeply, like reading letters from friends in rural areas, it seems that "not only can't you find cash in the village now, it's even difficult to scrape together fifty yuan in banknotes," a dance of ink.</p>
<p>Then I heard the boss in the apartment calling his little girl to kowtow, and then they set off firecrackers again, and then the sounds of heaven-shaking explosions echoed far and near, and then singing and dancing of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Then the courtyard was quiet, and then the goddess of dreams covered my leaping chest with black gauze.</p>
<p>So, praising peace. (Note: "Praising Peace" is a common inscription with gold letters on a black background seen on the stage of temples in my hometown when I was a child.)</p>
<h3 id="e152">Three Talks on Interviews <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Jie</p>
<p>In various examinations, in addition to the written test, there is often an interview section. Although it seems unimportant, it should not be ignored. I recently heard three things from a friend that are sufficient to prove this:</p>
<p>A certain company planned to recruit three trainees. For a time, a large number of people signed up, but only eight people passed the written test. Therefore, the company decided to interview these eight people in the morning. All eight people went on time, but the manager did not appear, only giving each person a bowl of wontons. When they were summoned, they were only asked, "How many wontons did you eat?" Only three people could answer, so only these three were hired.</p>
<p>Another factory recruited several supervisors. After the written test was completed, the qualified candidates were summoned one by one and asked to pass through a narrow passage to reach the interview location. On the road, there was a stool and a dustpan. Each candidate stepped over them, but only one person helped them up and placed them in the corner. Because this person could manage trivial matters and was detail-oriented, he was suitable for the position of supervisor and was hired.</p>
<p>A certain lady applied for a typist interview. The lady usually dressed very plainly, but she dressed up specially on this day. However, the examiner was afraid that she would not be content with the small salary, which led to her being rejected. The position was obtained by another candidate who was not as talented as the lady.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Five Colors of Beiping <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Man</p>
<p>Beiping is a political district, a cultural city, a display of ancient relics, and a dyeing vat mixed with sin.</p>
<p>Red is dyed on women's lips, freshly like a funnel dripping with blood, fox-like, held on men's arms, and men leisurely stroll as if carrying a cane. In the setting sun and lamplight of the guard's head, in the crowded city streets, this red color is particularly distinct. As long as cunning eyes weave back and forth, then in a charming smile, this red color seems to be selling the mark of flesh and soul.</p>
<p>Yellow is dyed on the walls of each house in the alleys. When the sun is sleepy and tired, various boys and girls emerge from under each wall, with messy hair and sweaty faces, squatting there and vigorously excreting this yellow dye. Sometimes, a snotty hand holds a branch and plays with its own creations. When tired of playing, they scold each other across the street. Xiao Shunzi scolds Wang Ni's mother for sleeping with Wang Laizi, and Wang Ni scolds Agou's sister for walking on the street with men. Then, in a cacophony, everyone scolds each other's mothers until a faint lamplight dyes the whole street, and everyone's mother comes out and scolds her own child's mother and goes in. Thus, two rows of yellow things are displayed on the street, making a precious decoration for this ancient city. Suddenly, two dogs bark and start fighting again.</p>
<p>Blue is dyed on the police's small stick in the center of the street. With a gentle lift and a whoosh, a car carrying a few pieces of glamorous flesh flies by; this blue stick lifts again, and a few more pieces of glamorous flesh fly by. The car seems to be disappointed without this decoration, and the witch-like woman in the car is always laughing. However, there are also times when the blue stick is raised and no car passes by. However, this stick happens to fall on the head of a rickshaw puller, so the rickshaw puller cannot but admit that this small stick is their authority.</p>
<p>White is painted on the faces of young people. After the fashionable urban girls and young masters get up at eleven o'clock, they must first wash their faces and then thickly apply face cream; what powder, what water, they always choose brands from Paris; in their hearts, they are indeed biting this white thing on their faces and living a romantic life. Although everyone says that applying it too white looks like a fairy, snow cream, still has a strong appeal. Which poor girl doesn't stand in front of the shop window in a daze?</p>
<p>Black is dyed on the faces, hands, nostrils, and hearts of coal miners. They seem to be destined to be black, moving like Indian Ah San, always so dull as if they have no human feelings. In the morning, when it is still very dark, they have to shrink their black heads and black hands to climb up. Black coal is loaded into black carts, and frozen, stiff hands hold the whip and lash the panting livestock, then they hang their heads and doze off, and the cart slowly crawls along the dusty road. They have no youth, no life, and life is just a rigid sacrifice in this black, trembling color.</p>
<p>——This Beiping, such a big dyeing vat, also dyes various colors of sin, symbolizing the essence of various lives. As long as you are a thoughtful person, you can definitely see the true colors and true face of Beiping in these colors.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>When a song was over, Ned bowed and wanted to retreat, but others would not let him go. They clapped non-stop, forcing him to come back again. When he came back again, he had a happy look on his face, and others felt happy when they saw it, because he did his best to give them cheerful old tunes, so that their feet also heard and danced, and everyone had moved and could not be quiet again.</p>
<p>"Quickly clear the deck!" Amy shouted: In less than a minute, the chairs had all been pushed to the back, the elderly were settled in the corners, and the children gathered on the stage.</p>
<p>"Be polite!" Amy shouted again: So the children all jumped to the women, and politely asked them to dance, regardless of the young or old. The little boys almost used force to grab the golden curls, but she chose Dick with a compassionate heart, letting him proudly lead her over. Xu Quren was also not allowed not to join: Aunt Amy gave Donn indescribable pleasure, because she resigned from Fulan and was willing to be with him. Naturally, Nann and Tomo, Ned and Xiao Mei each formed a pair, while Uncle Tandy invited Yaxi, who had been eager to try, and now suddenly felt flattered to receive such glory.

<h3 id="e172">Local Martial Arts Groups Express Opinions on Tai Chi Exercises for Participation in the World Games, to be Adopted by the World Games Preparatory Committee and Used to Train Participating Athletes <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The upcoming World Games will commence on August 1st in Germany. Our nation is actively preparing to participate. Recently, members from the local Martial Arts Hall and various martial arts groups believe that Tai Chi exercises have value in representing our country and performing in Germany at the World Games. Therefore, they have drafted a written opinion and submitted it to the World Games Preparatory Committee for consideration. Our reporter has obtained the original text of the opinion, which is as follows: In recent newspapers, the schedule of the World Games was published, commencing with the opening ceremony on August 1st and concluding with the closing ceremony on the 16th. The daily programs include athletics, swimming, various ball games, weightlifting, wrestling, fencing, martial arts, shooting, sailing, rowing, cycling, and equestrian events. Additionally, German and Swedish-style gymnastics are included. The nature of the World Games is an exhibition of sporting achievements. The venue should gather interesting, valuable, and historically significant materials related to physical education, to provide appreciation and adoption for the audience, and to demonstrate the comprehensiveness and soundness of the Games themselves. The purpose of the World Games to collect all kinds of sports as much as possible is none other than this. The sports mentioned above all occupy a considerable place in the history of physical education, and among them, the gymnastics category should attract our attention. Gymnastics is the most easily popularized sport in physical education, and it is listed as a formal course in schools. Therefore, all countries in the East and West regard gymnastics as a basic sport. Although the competitive element it contains is not as strong or interesting as other competitive sports, its great effectiveness surpasses all sports. The World Games will stage various gymnastics performances for the world, allowing physical education experts from various countries to critique and adopt what type of gymnastics is most suitable for physiology and can serve as a model for modern gymnastics. The profound intention and the importance attached to gymnastics can be seen here. Gymnastics is best known for the German and Swedish styles, which have long been adopted by countries around the world. However, in recent years, the Tai Chi exercises invented by Dr. Chu Minyi of our country, according to researchers, are actually superior to the German and Swedish styles in terms of effectiveness and value. Its excellent performance in last year's National Games was witnessed by the audience. To make readers understand its advantages, a brief description is provided below: Tai Chi exercises are based on the principles of Tai Chi Quan. Its circular movements allow all joints of the body to move simultaneously, and all parts of the body and mind develop equally. It also adopts the characteristics of ordinary gymnastics routines, making the movements gradually deepen from the upper limbs to the lower limbs, the head, waist, and torso, progressing in an orderly manner and coordinating by system. With more interest, memorization is easy. It also incorporates physiological and psychological elements, integrates and connects them to form this exercise. Therefore, when practitioners use it, they can make the intention reach the mind, the spirit follow it, enliven the body and mind, and make the hands and feet agile. The stretching of the whole body joints and the smooth flow of blood circulation have particularly special effects. Our country's physical education community has such a new invention. It should contribute the research results to the all-encompassing world sports exhibition. Not only can valuable criticisms and promotions be obtained in academics, but also the shame of the "sick man of East Asia" can be washed away due to the effectiveness of the Chinese-style gymnastics invention. It is hoped that the members of the preparatory committee for the World Games will adhere to the main purpose of promoting sports regardless of boundaries, promote the spirit of fearing to be behind in academic development, pay considerable attention, and adopt our contributions. Using the most economical and convenient method, part or all of the athletes participating in the upcoming events can be trained in Tai Chi exercises for a short period of time one month before going abroad, so that Chinese-style gymnastics can also be performed in the World Games arena, refreshing the audience. This is what we earnestly hope for.</p>

In the second half, Insurance attacked vigorously and managed to pull back a goal. As a result, South China defeated Insurance 2-1 to win the "Regulation" group championship. The South China lineup is as follows: Fei Shaojun, Zhou Shenxian, Wang Qi, Shen Fuqing, Wen Yichen, Jin Fengde, Meng Wenbin, Wu Shuping, Xiao Wenbin, Lu Maoqing, Zheng Shilin, Yao Guofan, Zhang Xiaoyuan, Zhu Chunrong, Li Dehua, Yang Chunlin.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Letter from the Chinese Vocational School Little Ball Team <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>In your newspaper the other day, in an article about the Pudong Little Ball team, you stated that our team member Yao Guanfan bought the top of Wang Degen. After reading this, we couldn't help but burst out laughing. The so-called Yao Guanfan and Wang Degen are actually the same person. He changed his name to Wang Degen to participate in the competition due to various family reasons (this does not violate the association's charter). At the time of registration, he had his own photo, which is kept in the association for verification (after the recent game, Mr. Huang verified the photo and found no error). Now that the association sees that our team is about to win the championship, it does not hesitate to reverse black and white and make such a ridiculous move. Our team's participation in the competition is merely an amateur game, and we have no selfish intentions regarding gains or losses. If the association must give the championship to its favorite, it may as well say so clearly, and our team is willing to hand it over to please the association. Now that the association promotes sports on the one hand and infringes on the legal rights of others on the other, which is so absurd, it is a departure from the normal state of promoting sports. We say to the association that right and wrong will eventually be clear, and it is impossible to cover up the truth from the world with one hand.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Yarn and Raw Cotton: Tianjin Actively Purchases Cotton Yarn – More Than 4,200 Bales Transacted <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has become calm, but the situation of spot yarn is exceptionally brisk. Because the yarn inventory of each factory has decreased and the sales market for customers has developed, Tianjin dealers are actively purchasing. Therefore, the root of spot yarn is lacking. However, the price of standard yarn is more than ten points higher than the low price. The European political situation has become calmer, and some are inclined to sell short.</p>
<p>The market for standard yarn is firm in the near term and weak in the long term. At the opening of the standard yarn market, the situation in each month was still firm. Tongcheng Company purchased according to the market price. At the same time, Osaka Sanpin yarn was firm and expensive. After the second session, Dachangcheng Jinye Bang closed out in large quantities. Hexing turned from long to short, and the market image was slightly frustrated. At the close of the third session, it was heard that spot yarn was purchased in the north, and the buying interest was strong and rebounded. As a result, the closing price for each month was higher than the closing price of the previous day by 1.2 to 4 points. The afternoon opening was stable. Because the situation of spot yarn was urgent, the financial community prepared to take delivery of the coming month and rose by another six or seven points. When shooting to the far month, the shorts still put pressure and turned weak. There was no major change in the second and third sessions. As a result, the near month was more than the morning closing package. Taichang 2,300 packages, Runkang 1,350 packages, Dachang 2,550 packages, Jinkang 1,350 packages, bought Deda 800 packages, Dafu 2,500 packages, Daji 2,250 packages, Jinchang 1,000 packages, Gengfeng 1,350 packages, Yichang 1,400 packages, Yongchang 850 packages, Changfeng 2,850 packages, Renfeng 600 packages, Changyu 800 packages. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales set a new record. The sales of spot yarn in North China are very brisk, and the prosperity of transactions has set a new record this year. Statistics show that all the gangs bought a total of 5,275 packages throughout the day, and the selling price soared by 3 to 4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Futures Raw Cotton Closed Out in Large Quantities - More Than 26,000 Loads Sold <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rebounded and fell, and the situation was weak, because speculator Jinye Bang Yang closed out a large number of more than 26,000 loads in large quantities. The market chips were loose and flooded. However, the overseas cotton industry situation was still stable. The large amount of the banking community still did not give up.</p>
<p>Futures cotton sold more than buying. At the opening of the standard flower market, because US cotton rose or fell by 2 to 10 pounds, Indian cotton rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee and a half, and Osaka Sanpin flower rose by 2.3 angles, the market situation was tense. Tongcheng Company dragged in a large amount, and each month rose by 2.3 angles. During the second session, Dachangcheng suddenly sold fiercely, and the longs came out in large quantities, more than 26,000 loads. Hexing also sold and closed out, so that the table turned loose, and the selling interest was particularly strong, falling by 3.5 angles. The closing of the third session was flat and weak. As a result, the closing price for each month fell by 1 to 2 points compared with the closing price of the previous day. This month rose by 5 points. After the afternoon opening, after the longs came out, the table turned loose, and the market situation became softer. As a result, each month fell by 5 points to 1.5 points compared with the morning closing price. Statistics show that Dachangcheng sold 26,500 loads, Jifeng 2,600 loads, Yuda 5,200 loads, and Xingchang 6,500 loads. Dafu bought 9,200 loads, Tongji 2,300 loads, Ji 3,400 loads, Gengfeng 4,300 loads, 3,100 loads, Changfeng 6,200 loads, Runkang 4,400 loads, Sheng 2,800 loads, Changhe 6,300 loads. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices during the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot flower asking price is too expensive. The consumption of spot cotton is slightly quiet, because the holders are asking for too high a price, and it is difficult for both parties to reach a deal, so transactions are slightly rare. The source is completely absent.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton Market is Firm and Expensive</p>
<p>In the cotton market last week, the initial fear of war made the shorts and futures traders uneasy, and the market price rose. Then there was a reaction, and finally, due to a large number of short coverings, it became firm and expensive again. Europe and China are normal, and Japan's transactions are quite smooth. The factory demand is slightly lower than usual due to the sluggish cloth market. A large number of White Luo Creek and Sura flowers have arrived. In the spot market, the demand for Pinger is reduced, and Aumra is quite smooth. The appendix is the statistics for last week as follows: (unit: thousand packages)</p>
<p>Sanpin Yarn and Raw Cotton are Stable</p>
<p>Osaka Electric on the 16th: Sanpin Sisha fell by 1 angle to rise by 1 yuan and 2 angles. The near month is 193 yuan and 9 angles, and the far month is 193 yuan and 6 angles. Futures cotton rose by 5 points to 7 angles. The near target is 62 yuan 5 points and 5 points, and the far month is 60 yuan 4 points and 5 points.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Food: The Reason for the Frequent Rise in Standard Flour - A Large Number of Purchases Outside the Industry... Transactions Reach More Than 80 Million - Each Factory Also Sells Less... Leading to a Lack of Chips for the Shorts <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month showed a sign of being mentioned. The quotation of foreign wheat will fall back by about 2 or 3 angles. However, the current market sentiment seems to be unrelated to the quotation of foreign wheat. The difference between the target and the four-month and six-month periods is too large, and the problem of ordinary goods has still not been reduced. Therefore, there is no hesitation in purchasing in large quantities. Since the rise in the market last week, it seems to be related to this. Statistics show that the near term is good for 2 points, and the far term is good for 3 points, and transactions reach 80 million. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the rise in March and April was still flat. Starting in June, because buyers were still eager and each factory did not sell, the shorts lacked chips on the table, and the rise was exceptionally sharp, 3 to 4 points better than in the morning. Observing the future, I am afraid there will be another storm.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Far-Term Wheat Rises Sharply in the Afternoon - Spot Wheat Factory Stomach Does Not Move <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market opened in the morning, because the price of foreign imports fell by about 3 angles, and the weather turned harmonious and people's hearts calmed down. The opening prices for each month were lower than the previous day by 2 to 3 points. Transactions in each month were not prosperous due to the market atmosphere turning flat. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions in this month were not smooth, and the price was less surprising. However, starting in June, due to the high rise in the flour market in the morning, and the addition of a large number of outside long positions in the afternoon, the market surged step by step, rising by as much as 1 point compared to the closing price in the morning. Observing the current market, it has been surrounded by speculative forces. How the people eat is not something that the long positions can consider. Spot wheat was not seen because the factory stomach did not move.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Ke Xian is Still Actively Sold on This Street <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian continued to be loaded in Changjiang and other ports. However, Jiujiang and other places have taken measures to ban exports, and other provinces also have proposals for similar bans. Therefore, the market sentiment is slightly firm. However, the source outside the ban is increasing, and the foreign rice inventory is being gradually sold off. Orders will also arrive in Shanghai one after another. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, the price continued to be slightly higher by about 1 angle. It was still difficult to stand firm in the afternoon. The whole day fell by a small amount of 1 angle to 1.5 angles. Fortunately, the destocking on this street turned active, and there was more military demand, and there were more transactions, so the market did not continue to fall. The whole day opened 4,500 bags of Gan rice, 100 bags of Xiang rice, 1,500 bags of Han brown rice, 1,450 bags of Wen Tai rice, 200 bags of foreign rice, 500 bags of Siamese rice, and 150 tons of futures rice. Foreign rice line stores insisted, and the selling price rebounded.</p>
<h3 id="e182">River Rice Sales Market Turns 淡 <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were still more than forty sources from various gangs (a total of more than 9,000 stones of goods), but the sales market on this street suddenly turned淡, and the package stomach also felt uncomfortable. Although Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihaiwei and other gangs handled more than 2,000 packages, the eating plate was tighter, causing the price of thin rice to fall by several points and corners. The price of thick early japonica rice also fell by corners. Du Yangjian was tired, and Yin Bianyuan was also soft.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-six or seven ships arrived from various roads downstream. The market transactions were sluggish. The price of white japonica rice was firm. The road for thin rice was flat. The package stomach moved slightly, and the price was firm. The price of early rice was slightly better by six or seven points. The prices of other rice were the same as before.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Oil Cake and Miscellaneous Grains Have Rises and No Falls - 5,000 Bags of Soybeans Sold <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard oil bean cake markets continued to soar across the board. Although the Da Su Express oil market once reported a rise, the market prices were all hovering. People in the industry did not expect it to be very good. However, the spot soybeans arrived in rare quantities and sold actively. Car factories and customer gangs had a great demand, so the standard bean market price originally had a hope of stepping up. However, after the market opened yesterday, outside hoarding purchases became even more greedy. The prosperity of buying interest has not been discovered for a long time. Standard cake was also lively with spot sales, raw materials were expensive, and outside speculation was triggered. The forenoon sessions have seen a rise. In the afternoon, the speculation heat was even higher. The market then continued to rise. At the final closing, the standard oil soared by 5, 6, and 7 angles. It has soared by more than 1 yuan in two days. The standard rose by 1 point, 9 points, and 1 point and 3 points respectively. It has soared by about 4 points in three or four days. The standard cake also rose by about 4 points.</p>
<p>Due to the ups and downs of the oil bean cake and miscellaneous grains, the market conditions in various production areas have turned expensive. Unfavorable transportation has led to a sparse source. Moreover, during the season when spring is ripe and the old is not yet connected, and the inland river channels are becoming smoother day by day, the sales markets in various roads are gradually sprouting. In addition, the Nanyang Gang's export handling stomach is closely followed, so the prices of various goods can soar straight up. The factory's own bean oil opened at 20 yuan yesterday. The steamboat Niuzhuang oil opened at 21 yuan and 2 angles, Dalian oil opened at 20 yuan and 3 angles, and peanut oil opened at 19 yuan and 3 angles. The factory's own four-brand cake opened at 1 yuan 7 angles and 8 points. The general trend is still brisk. 1,000 bags of Hehe soybeans were opened yesterday, and the price was 5 yuan, 3 angles, and 5 points. 1,500 bags of Zhumadian beans were transacted, and the price opened at 5 yuan and 3 angles. 2,400 bags of Du Dousha Huangcheng were settled. The market bear has rises and no falls. On the previous day, Yangzhuang sesame was opened for 200 tons, which was advanced by the Hankou gang, and the price was 11 yuan, 2 angles, and 7 points. It was 1 angle and 7 points higher than the previous market.</p>

Although the morning opening was high, it was still inferior if the 加 期 calculation was added.

The HSBC Bank's listing announcement showed that the English and American were flat, the market situation was quite flat.

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, although it was Monday, and trading should have increased as usual, the clarity of yesterday's trading and the sluggishness of the market set a new record that the exchange had never seen. Regardless of whether they were investors or speculators, everyone was an observer. From opening to closing, there were absolutely no deals in each round. The total time spent on trading in all four rounds was less than an hour. Such repeated sluggishness and lack of trading are worrying. It is feared that once a large-scale attack occurs, the resulting changes will be unmanageable. How the changes in the environment will evolve will soon be revealed to us more clearly. Yesterday, in the first round, over 100,000 Class A bonds were sold, with a slight increase of 1.5 jiao, and the rest only a slight 0.5 to 1 jiao. The fluctuations in the final round were only between 0.5 and 1 jiao. When the market opened in the afternoon, Class E bonds rose by 5 fen, and the rest by a small 1 to 2 jiao. At closing, Class E bonds improved by another 1 jiao, and the rest remained around a small 1 jiao. These minor differences of 5 fen or 1 jiao are not enough to be called market price increases or decreases. The market is desolate, market prices are numb, and people's hearts are also scattered. In total, the results of the market prices for the whole day showed that only Class E bonds rose by 1 jiao, and the rest fell slightly by 1 to 2 jiao. The total transaction volume was only 1,555,000 yuan, setting a new record for the lowest trading volume in the exchange's history. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan).</p>

<p>Recently, the green tea market has been uneven. Zhenmei green tea of good quality has sluggish sales due to the large amount of inventory in Morocco, and the market is still stagnant. However, Showmei green tea with slender and broken body has recently experienced a surge in exports due to the development of sales in the South Sea Islands. Soon, tea companies shipped a total of more than 8,000 packages for export. It is found that the sales of Chinese tea in the South Sea Islands have not been very large in the past. The reason for its development is actually a good sign of currency reform in China. The vigorous promotion by overseas Chinese in that area is also a contributing factor.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Nursing Profession in China Today (Part 1) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>The nursing profession today is a modern and emerging profession. In advanced countries in Europe and America, the nursing profession is recognized as a basic profession that protects the health of the nation and serves society. It has a close and critical relationship with the strength of the country and the progress of society. It occupies a significant practical need in the entire social group. Therefore, the promotion of the nursing profession and the development of nursing education are progressing rapidly.</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation of the nursing profession in our country, it has a history of more than 50 years. Why is it that the government authorities and people from all walks of life still cannot understand the importance of the work of the nursing profession and the inevitability of the existence of the nursing profession? Furthermore, can the medical and pharmaceutical community, which is closely related to the nursing profession like limbs, correctly and deeply understand the true meaning of the nursing profession? I am afraid that it is very rare. Then, in the social groups of other countries, the nursing profession can be regarded as important, but why is it behind in the Chinese social environment of the same country? This is indeed the most urgent central issue that the nursing profession needs to study at present. Therefore, we must think and observe a lot to see what the current situation of the Chinese nursing profession is, so as to provide basic reference for promoting the nursing profession in the future. A. The General Situation of the Nursing Profession</p>
<p>(1) The Administration of Nursing Schools Cannot Be Independent. The backwardness of the nursing profession in China can be attributed to many complex problems. However, the most important crux that prevents the nursing profession in China from developing and progressing is the lack of independence of the nursing schools themselves, the unsound organization, and the control of the administrative power by the hospital authorities. The budget of a school, the selection of teaching talents, the compilation of curriculum and teaching materials, the equipment of books and instruments, and all kinds of equipment must be built on a solid school administrative organization. Undoubtedly, the issue of the independence of the administrative power of the nursing school is the central mechanism that controls the success or failure, rise or fall of the nursing profession. However, the number of nursing schools established in China is indeed not small, and they have seemingly established the banner of school independence. In reality, the administrative power of the school is entirely manipulated, controlled, and dominated by the hospital. Since the school administration is managed and controlled by the hospital, what is the value of the existence of this puppet-like school? This is nothing more than wanting to use the name of the school to attract and confuse the public, so as to recruit male and female students, and work as the most economical and basic laborers in the hospital. Therefore, it is more pleasing to say that it is an administrative organ for hospitals to recruit laborers than to say that it is the existence of the school itself.</p>
<p>(2) The Decline of Nursing Education. Since the school administration cannot be independent, all the facilities of the school are of course lacking. It is very obvious to us that we cannot talk about the possibility of nursing education at all. Establishing the central goal of nursing education and laying the foundation for teaching principles cannot be considered as the nursing education has gone to the road of decline, and it is becoming more and more acute day by day. Since the whole purpose of recruiting students is not to cultivate talents and to be suitable for the needs of society, but to save hospital costs as a prerequisite, in terms of "teaching," the knowledge of nurses, the skills of nursing, can only take into account the current needs of the hospital as the scope, and cannot consider the conditions to adapt to the society in the future. In terms of "education," it does not take the psychological needs of students and the state of mind as the standard of "education," but instead establishes strict rules and regulations, and three chapters of the law, so that students spend the whole day in an unorganized and unsystematic apprentice-style life. Under the current situation of nursing education where teaching is not education and education is impossible, it can be considered that the period of decline of nursing education has come to an end.

<h3 id="e195">Resurrection (Part 2) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yueqi</p>
<p>—Eighteenth Medical Story—</p>
<p>One day, a white-haired old man was sent to the hospital. He was very ill, and as soon as he entered the hospital, he underwent surgery. Two weeks later, he underwent a second operation. As soon as the anesthetic was administered, the old man stopped breathing and his heart stopped working. Artificial respiration could not save his life. So the surgeons decided to perform the final treatment. They prepared a liquid containing one part per thousand Epinephrine. Five minutes after the old man collapsed, the liquid was injected into his left ventricle. The effect was very rapid. Within thirty seconds, the old man began to breathe, and his heart began to beat again.</p>
<p>Since then, such miracles have become commonplace. Countless lives have been saved by this method. Some collapsed during surgery, some were stillborn infants, and some died from electric shock. Currently, this method has been practically applied in hospitals.</p>
<p>One day, in the area of Di Tuo Lio, a thief was killed by the police. He was clearly dead and sent to the hospital. After being injected with epinephrine, he woke up, although only for a short time, but enough to give the names of his accomplices.</p>
<p>However, in none of these cases could doctors determine that the resurrected person was truly "dead." This is not surprising, because no one can determine when the human body actually dies. The so-called "sudden death" seems to be non-existent.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is assumed that the end of life is sudden, like flipping a switch to cut off the current. In fact, the rule of "death" is slow, gradual, and similar to the collapse of a great empire. The brain and heart are like the capital of the empire, dying first. The cells of other parts of the body, like the colonies of the empire, are not immediately extinguished, but wait for the final collapse. Without nourishment sent from the capital, without reinforcements to help kill the "enemy"—harmful chemical changes and bacteria—they finally die.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is difficult to determine the moment of the transition between "life" and "death." Common tests, because they do not include the procedure of "cutting open blood vessels," are not completely reliable. The cessation of breathing and the cessation of heartbeat, although often accompanied by "death," cannot always be regarded as evidence of "death."</p>
<p>"Apparent death" is common. Recently, in a London park, a child was seen on the ground, his body cold, with no pulse, obviously dead. After being sent to the hospital, the doctor also confirmed that he was dead and issued a death certificate. As the body was carried to the cemetery, ready to be buried, the child's mother arrived. She heard others say that her son was dead, and firmly refused to admit it; she presented three death certificates previously issued by doctors for her child, and everyone was surprised to wait. After a while, the child woke up and walked home with his mother.</p>
<p>Even perfectly healthy people can sometimes feign death. At an exhibition in Lahore, India, there was a case of a living person feigning death. A mendicant named Harodas voluntarily fainted. He was placed in a bag in a wooden box and buried in the soil ten feet above the ground. There were sentries guarding the ground, and there was obviously no fraud or trickery. After forty days, the soil was dug up, and the monk's body was brought into the air. Before long, he actually sat up and asked for food.</p>
<p>Since the determination of "true death" is so difficult, the "resurrection" that Dr. Connersey is working on is undoubtedly a question of whether it can truly be realized. However, thanks to the progress of medicine, the fate of "unjust death" and "early burial" can at least be avoided.</p>
<h3 id="e196">World View of Tuberculosis Statistics (Part 1) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>If we want to prevent the occurrence of a disease, we must not only study its causes, but also pay attention to its spread, historical changes, and human geographical relationships. This is what statistics is all about. This science of statistics has recently become a necessary tool for any scientific research. In the United Kingdom, it is regarded as one of the most important subjects in public health. For example, Wolff proved that the number of deaths due to tuberculosis in the industrial areas of European countries has gradually decreased due to the gradual improvement of their sanitation facilities. Wolff also proved at the same time that there is a relationship between tuberculosis mortality and cancer mortality and housing, and found that there is a direct relationship between tuberculosis mortality and residential density, while there is none in cancer mortality.</p>
<p>Taking the tuberculosis mortality statistics of Germany as an example, from 1924 (the year when Germany collected disease mortality statistics throughout the country) to 1932, there were obvious changes as follows:</p>
<p>The number of people who died of tuberculosis per 10,000 residents</p>
<p>1924 12.0 1925 10.7</p>
<p>1926 9.8</p>
<p>1927 9.3</p>
<p>1928 8.8</p>
<p>1929 8.7 1930 7.9</p>
<p>1931 7.9</p>
<p>1932 7.5</p>
<p>From the above statistics, the number of deaths per 10,000 residents decreased from 12 to 7.5. This achievement shows the efforts of anti-tuberculosis efforts over the years. In 1930, there was a slight pause in the decrease in the number of deaths. According to Flatzeck Holbauer, this pause in the decline is due to cultural and sanitary relations, and more importantly, to economic relations. Frantz believes that most patients belong to the poor class, but after the improvement of sanitary facilities, the death rate of tuberculosis is also reduced.</p>
<p>Frantz believes that the reduction in tuberculosis mortality can be observed in two ways and periods. The first period was from 1885 to 1925. During this period, there was a real reduction in tuberculosis mortality. Since 1925, it has been the second period. The reason for the reduction in mortality is due to the progress of nuclear therapy and the development of anti-tuberculosis work.</p>
<p>Goldstein's statistical opinion is that from the standpoint of public health, the reduction of tuberculosis mortality is extremely related to occupation and nutrition, and less related to housing. The organizations of public clinics and insurance institutions are directly related to the reduction of tuberculosis mortality.</p>
<p>According to Jckert's research, it is believed that at present, Germany has no major problems with the nutrition of the people due to the organization of public protection and the progress of public health. Even if there are people with insufficient nutrition, they will not individually affect the tuberculosis mortality rate. However, if malnutrition affects other issues, such as clinics and anti-tuberculosis work, work regulations, housing levels, industrial areas, etc., it is related to tuberculosis mortality.</p>
<p>Hofbauer believes that the poor have a considerable correlation with the occurrence of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Neumann believes that the reduction of tuberculosis mortality in Germany and Austria is illusory and not a real reduction. Looking at the declining situation over the years, the annual reduction is somewhat, almost with a certain regularity, and how is it so procedural, which makes people question. This gradual reduction in mortality may be due to the fact that after the World War and the famine, tuberculosis initially increased and then gradually decreased. However, in 1921, the tuberculosis mortality rate in Germany was the same as before the war. In any case, the risk of tuberculosis infection has been greatly reduced compared to before, so the mortality rate has also decreased.</p>
<p>According to Ascher's research, the reason for the reduction in tuberculosis mortality is the reduction in people's working hours.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Less, increasing mechanical capacity, and the maintenance of human physical strength. In addition, the direct relationship is that work and rest must be scheduled, and the human body increases its resistance as a result.</p>
<p>Wolff and Gundel believe that the reason for the reduction of tuberculosis mortality is due to public health on the one hand, and genetic relations and the progress of medical treatment on the other hand. Considerable achievements have been made in civilized countries. However, the economic situation of German society in recent years is not very good, but the tuberculosis mortality rate has been reduced more than in other countries. There must be special reasons, and the strict organization of public health insurance is undoubtedly the reason. Because other countries do not have such a health insurance organization method. Looking at Geissler's research over the years, it was found that the mortality rate of tuberculosis is lower among working employees, and the mortality rate of those in free professions or leadership professions is higher, which is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Looking at the tuberculosis mortality rate in various parts of Germany, there are slightly different points. The lowest is Hessen, with 5.11 deaths per 10,000 people due to pulmonary tuberculosis, Sachsen is 5.7, Baden is 6.0, Bayern is 6.4, and Preussen is 6.46. Hessen is an agricultural area, and Sachsen is an industrial area with a denser population.</p>

<p>(22) Dandelion Taraxacum Platycarpum, Dahlst</p>
<p>(Botany) Grows naturally in the mountains and fields. It is a perennial herb. The leaves emerge from the roots, lanceolate in shape, with large serrated lobes. The lobes are triangular with tooth-like edges and sharp tips. In spring, it blooms with head-shaped flowers, the ligulate flowers being yellow. The fruit is small and slender, spindle-shaped, with a pappus of fine white hairs.</p>
<p>European dandelion T. Officinale, Web. grows naturally in Europe and America and is slightly larger than the previous species. The tip of the head-shaped flower involucre has no bony protrusions.</p>
<p>White-flowered dandelion T. Albidun, Dahlst. grows naturally in the central and southern parts of Japan and has white flowers.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Dandelion Radix Taraxaci Cum Herba refers to the previously mentioned plant, its roots collected and dried before flowering. The product is spindle-shaped, with short, fine fibrous roots, measuring 0.5-2.5 cm in diameter and 10-20 cm in length. The surface is grayish-brown, with longitudinal deep grooves and wrinkles. The fractured surface is flat. It tastes neither sweet nor bitter.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The composition of this species has not yet been studied. The components contained in the roots of the European dandelion have been identified, as shown below.</p>
<p>Acetic acid, 3-4-cinnamic acid, palmitic acid, cerotinic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, Taraxasterol C29 H24OH, Homotaraxasterol C25 H39 OH, Cluytianol C29 H46O(OH)4, Cholin, etc.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Dandelion is mainly made into dandelion juice (dandelion extract), used as an antipyretic, hemostatic, sudorific, stomachic, and tonic, but this is no longer common. It is also said to have the effect of promoting bile secretion.</p>
<p>Dandelion extract, 0.5-2.0 cm each time, several times a day, used as pills or aqueous solutions.</p>
<p>Prescription example: Dandelion decoction, effective in promoting breast milk secretion.</p>
<p>Dandelion 6.0 Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis) 4.0 Shuyu (Dioscorea japonica) 2.0 Xiangfuzi (Cyperus rotundus) 2.0 Mudanpi (Paeonia suffruticosa) 1.0 The above is made into a decoction of 200cc, taken three times a day.</p>
<p>Folk remedies: When breast milk secretion is insufficient, soaking dandelion leaves and taking them several times a day is effective. In Germany, dandelion roots are chopped, roasted, and used as a substitute for coffee.</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Section 3: Adult Oral Hygiene</p>
<p>(Question 117) Why is it that most people brush their teeth improperly?</p>
<p>Answer: The main purpose of brushing teeth is to clean the mouth and remove food debris. Most people brush horizontally from side to side. With this method, the bristles cannot easily reach the gaps and convexities between teeth. Food hidden there cannot be completely brushed away. Moreover, if the toothbrush is stiff, horizontal brushing easily causes the gums at the neck of the teeth to recede, exposing the root. Because the root is softer, prolonged friction erodes it into small grooves, which is harmful.</p>
<p>(Question 118) What is the proper way to brush teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: You should brush vertically up and down, that is, brush the upper teeth downwards and the lower teeth upwards along the tooth gaps. This makes it easier to brush out the food stuck in the gaps. Then, brush horizontally a few times to remove any remaining debris. Another method that can also be used is to brush in a circular motion. At this time, do not open your mouth too wide, and brush both the upper and lower teeth at the same time. This method combines both vertical and horizontal movements and is easy to perform. You can choose either of the above two methods.</p>
<p>(Question 119) What other points should be noted when brushing teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: There are three other points to note:</p>
<p>(1) The inner side of the teeth, that is, the side near the tongue, must also be brushed. If vertical brushing is inconvenient, horizontal brushing can be used. (2) The occlusal surface of the molars is prone to cavities, so it should be brushed more to remove food debris. (3) The last teeth inside the upper and lower cavities must also be brushed.</p>
<p>(Question 120) Besides the teeth, what other parts should be brushed?</p>
<p>Answer: The second purpose of brushing teeth is to strengthen the gums. Therefore, when brushing teeth, the inner and outer gums should be brushed, whether horizontally or vertically. In addition, the surface of the tongue should also be lightly brushed a few times. In the morning, this is especially important to remove accumulated debris.</p>
<p>(Question 121) How many times a day should you brush your teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Once in the morning and once after each meal, for a total of four times a day. Brushing after dinner is the most important because food in the mouth ferments and becomes acidic more easily at night than during the day. Therefore, you should brush more thoroughly before going to bed. Also, you should brush immediately after each meal. If you eat food again after brushing your teeth after dinner, you should brush your teeth again.</p>
<p>(Question 122) What kind of toothbrush should you choose?</p>
<p>Answer: The toothbrush should not be straight because our teeth are arranged in a horseshoe-shaped curve. Therefore, the surface of the toothbrush should also be curved so that it can be conveniently and closely fitted when brushing. The bristles of the toothbrush should not be too hard or too soft. Too hard can easily damage the gums and cause bleeding; too soft will not remove dirt. The bristles in the middle of the toothbrush should be staggered like canine teeth and should not be flat like a cut. They should also be arranged sparsely and not too densely. If they are too dense, the water will not dry easily, and bacteria will easily multiply. Currently, there are two types of toothbrushes on the market with a crescent-shaped concave and convex surface. The concave one is used to brush the outside of the teeth, and the convex one is used to brush the inside of the teeth. You should buy both and use them at the same time, which is more convenient and beneficial when brushing.</p>

<p>(81) Diphtheritic Conjunctivitis</p>
<p>Diphtheria is commonly known as white throat. It occurs most often in the pharynx and larynx. It occurs less often in the nasal cavity. These three types of diphtheria conditions have already been published in this column. What is described now is a type of diphtheria that occurs in the conjunctiva of the eye. This type of conjunctivitis is often secondarily infected by the diphtheria bacteria. Its main symptom is that initially the eyelids become red and swollen. Then, a grayish-white pseudomembrane develops on the conjunctival surface of the eyelids. The pseudomembrane is formed by the coagulation of fibrin contained in the eye secretions. It appears as a dirty grayish-white color. Its hardness is very strong, and it is not easily peeled off. If forced to peel off, it can bleed. This is a characteristic feature of general diphtheria pseudomembranes. If the pseudomembrane deeply invades the conjunctival tissue, it can compress the blood vessels and cause tissue necrosis. The necrotic conjunctival tissue can often fall off together with the pseudomembrane, resulting in ulcers. Therefore, after the disease is cured, the conjunctival surface often leaves scars.</p>
<p>Complications of diphtheritic conjunctivitis are often corneal ulcers and corneal perforation. These complications are more likely to occur when combined with streptococci. The inflammatory symptoms of conjunctivitis are also more severe. Therefore, its prognosis is generally poor.</p>
<p>This disease must be distinguished from other pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. Because conjunctivitis caused by streptococci, staphylococci, pneumococci, and gonococci, etc., can sometimes develop grayish-white pseudomembranes on the conjunctival surface of the eyelids. At this time, bacterial examination can easily distinguish them.</p>
<p>If the disease has been definitively diagnosed, a large dose of diphtheria antitoxin should be injected early, which is often effective. At the same time, treat the affected eye. If the affected eye is only on one side, then protective goggles should be used to protect the healthy eye on the other side to prevent infection. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Cannonballs and Workers' Housing <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>German leader Hitler, in his speech to the people in Karlsruhe regarding the dispatch of troops to the Rhineland area, said: "Currently, a twelve-inch cannonball costs three thousand marks. With an additional fifteen hundred marks, I can build a worker's house. Firing a million of these cannonballs is of no benefit, but their value can build countless workers' houses." This is Hitler's "peace" speech. He declared to the world with great satisfaction: "Today's Germany is truly the most 'peaceful' country in the world." In ancient China, there was the event of calling a deer a horse. The "peace" that Mr. Hitler speaks of is probably similar to this.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hitler's statement that a twelve-inch cannonball plus fifteen hundred marks can build a worker's house is very meaningful. Analyzing why countries around the world must have extremely strong military forces, sparing no expense of half of each country's financial resources to build terrible and cruel killing machines, what is the reason for this? On the one hand, we see that in countries around the world, there are hundreds of thousands of hungry masses, their voices hoarse, their blood and tears flowing, writhing under the oppression of hunger and cold, unable to maintain even the mere right to "live." What is the reason for this? If the current military equipment of countries around the world, and the money used to build this massive military equipment, were distributed, what would the world become? Currently, the military expenditure of countries around the world often accounts for 30% to 40% or more (such as Japan) of their total expenditure. Building an airplane costs tens of thousands of dollars, and building a warship costs millions or even tens of millions of dollars. Manufacturing a twelve-inch cannonball costs three thousand marks, which is still a very small expense. However, on the other hand, the finances of various countries are constantly announcing the increase in "deficit," and the people's taxes are being increased as much as possible. In a few countries with a small amount of "worker insurance," this insurance is eventually canceled or further reduced. The original purpose of human labor was to seek a better and more comfortable life, but now the whole world is using its strength to do the work of exterminating humanity. Is this the normal path of human history? Or has the whole world gone astray?</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler said very nicely that manufacturing a twelve-inch cannonball costs three thousand marks, plus fifteen hundred marks, "I can build a worker's house." But the cause he is actually pursuing is precisely to exhaust himself in manufacturing twelve-inch cannonballs.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Two Soldiers in Manzhouli <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ji</p>
<p>At dusk, Manzhouli was as silent as if it had died, immersed in desolation. Only the dogs barked and ran, making one feel a little alive. - However, what a sad vitality!</p>
<p>Two men, called "devil soldiers," walked shoulder to shoulder, stepping disorderly, chattering about something they themselves did not understand. They stared at the desolate front, walking disorderly.</p>
<p>"Look! Our motherland is over there!" The taller one pointed to the distant front.</p>
<p>The shorter one nodded with silent worry, expressing his sincere reply.</p>
<p>Then everyone was chattering in a mess again. Suddenly, the shorter one sighed and said:</p>
<p>"Let's not think about our home anymore!"</p>
<p>Silence. The wind in Manzhouli at dusk blew on people's faces, so cold that the whole body felt like it was falling into an ice cellar. However, the two soldiers seemed not to feel it at all, and walked aimlessly forward.</p>
<p>They walked into a village, full of dilapidated walls and crumbling walls, and a kind of desolate sorrow also seeped into the hearts of the two soldiers. They looked at each other, and then their steps faltered.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, suddenly in front of their eyes, like a ghost, a small animal slipped past their eyes. Perhaps the small animal was frightened, but she ran to the two soldiers. The taller one picked her up. The child cried:</p>
<p>"Mom - Mom - oh!"</p>
<p>"Don't cry! No..." He said, struggling to speak the local dialect. He looked at her little face. "Ah!... Look!" He turned his head to the shorter one. He couldn't help but hug her tightly and deeply kiss her little face.</p>
<p>The child cried loudly.</p>
<p>But he said to her in a trembling voice: "No, no, don't cry! Little sister! Where is your father? Where is your mother?"</p>
<p>The little girl glanced at him with frightened eyes. Seeing that he had no malicious intent, she trembled and replied: "Father and mother were killed by you!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the two soldiers were shocked as if struck by lightning. They looked at each other again. At this time, they only heard a voice like tearing paper crying out: "Give me back my granddaughter! Give me back - " An old woman cried to them: "You killed my children, my daughters-in-law, my,... Do you still want to kill my child?" The old woman couldn't say anymore, just crying.</p>
<p>They returned the little girl to the old woman and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>The next day at dusk, the two soldiers appeared here again. They each carried a few packages of things. They found the little girl's house. The taller one held the child in his arms and put a few packages in front of the child: "Eat! Eat! Eat oh!" The elderly grandmother snatched the few packages: "Can't eat! Can't eat oh! It's, it's poisonous..."</p>
<p>Their whole hearts were stung. The two soldiers, like wounded beasts, retreated from the family.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>But tomorrow, they came again. ... In this way, they came here every day for a month. Now, the little girl was no longer afraid of them, and even called them uncles. The elderly grandmother also treated them very politely. She no longer greeted them with suspicious eyes. The two soldiers also seemed to feel very happy.</p>
<p>But one night, at about twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, gunshots suddenly rang out nearby. This dense and terrible sound continued for three hours before it finally subsided.</p>
<p>The next morning, everyone ran around telling each other: "The volunteers came yesterday!" "But they were defeated!" People sighed, and people were indignant. ...</p>
<p>This evening, the shorter soldier walked alone to the little girl's house. His face was all pale. He brought a bag of sweets. The old grandmother was very surprised and asked: "Where is the other one?"</p>
<p>"Killed last night!"</p>
<p>The whole room was filled with the silence of death. But it was still the elderly grandmother who spoke first: "I want to ask, why do you always bring us things to eat? You treat others very fiercely!"</p>
<p>"Alas: This child of yours is too much like my friend's child. We have been away from our hometown for several years, but we have never seen our wives and children at home. So when my friend saw your child, because she looked so much like them, he was so happy that he wanted to come here every day. - But, but now he's dead! Alas! What should his child do..."</p>
<p>"Who told you to come and beat us!" The old grandmother's angry words.</p>
<p>The shorter soldier silently slipped away during a period of silence!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Courtyard <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>The sunlight moved from the window to the top of the poplar tree, and gradually, it disappeared like a ghost. Then, the vast twilight melted away the light of day like flowing water.</p>
<p>The courtyard was quiet. Moreover, it had a somewhat desolate tone—next to the path paved with broken bricks, tangled weeds, wild vines, kudzu, and some similar climbing plants spread. Under the corner of the wall, several unknown purple small flowers drooped their heads. The haggard and sorrowful face of the poplar tree nailed them down. Not far from the foot of the tree, there was a pile of messy grass occupying a large area. A white kitten crawled out from there, paced to the shed at the entrance of the house, shook its body, and its golden, somewhat bewildered eyes suspiciously glanced around.</p>
<p>There was a time when this place was very lively, it was summer, right, every evening or night, people sat here, talking about things that it - the kitten - did not understand, but could be felt within its consciousness.</p>
<p>Maybe it was like this.</p>
<p>Young people often laughed, danced, and talked loudly about the charm of youth: middle-aged people came to chat about family affairs and human relationships: old people always sighed as their own comfort, because there were too many beautiful dreams in the past days. …</p>
<p>Later, I don't know why, people became deserted. Some just hid at home.</p>
<p>When a light breeze, turning from warm to slightly cold, slipped past, it just remembered to ask for news, but the cunning wind shook its head and left.</p>
<p>That day was a bright autumn day, and it felt excited. But, it didn't see people, where are the people?</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sun gradually set in the west.</p>
<p>A little girl picked a large basket of wildflowers in the courtyard. It thought flowers were smart, so it went to ask the flowers. But, it was disappointed. - Other flowers were either taken to heaven by God, or they all wore haggard, tearful, bitter faces. Only those small flowers with fine yellow petals were in full bloom. However, seeing the pride and disregard for other things in those flowers, it hesitated.</p>
<p>It wanted to ask the grass, but the shrinking and declining appearance of the grass made it feel even more sad and sad.</p>
<p>-Why is it so lonely!</p>
<p>No answer, no reply. It was very annoyed…</p>
<p>A flock of crows returning to their nests, dragging mournful cries, swept across the sky. In the quiet twilight, fluctuating sounds floated.</p>
<p>Slowly - weakening: and quietly disappearing again.</p>
<p>The courtyard at dusk looked like it was tired and about to die.</p>
<p>Until dusk closed its gray, bewildered eyes and entered the realm of slumber, some dim lights shone through the windows from inside the house.</p>
<p>The light gently caressed the pale fabric of the small grass at the foot of the poplar tree. In this way, the old poplar tree sighed</p>
<p>-Why don't you also illuminate my haggard old face!</p>
<p>Perhaps it was bored, the white kitten crawled back into the pile of grass again.</p>
<p>The courtyard was always quiet. ……</p>

<p>— (Blow)</p>
<p>German troops have entered the Rhineland, and the situation in Europe is very tense. Now, the Berlin Gazette has even published the statement about building fortresses in the Rhineland. Tan Laosan said that during the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, most countries stood idly by, saying a few sarcastic remarks. Anyway, it was the Chinese who were unlucky. During the Italian-Ethiopian War, although countries once showed signs of panic, they eventually calmed down. Anyway, it was the black slaves who were unlucky. Now, with the Rhineland incident, this is probably an imminent disaster. Walking on thin ice, things are getting tighter and tighter, and troubles are getting deeper and deeper. Let's see what the countries do.</p>
<p>The signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, in their meeting in London the other day, Italian representative Grandi claimed that since the Great War, the European situation had never been as serious as it is now, because the resolutions adopted by the League of Nations in Geneva were tyrannical and unfair. Tan Laosan said that this statement is correct from the perspective of the Italians, and even more correct from our perspective.</p>

<p>Newsboy…Hong Ren</p>
<p>Suzhou Night Talk</p>
<p>Old painter Liu Shukang led four students to Suzhou to sketch, staying at the Suzhou Hotel. That morning, the teachers and students went to Tiger Hill for a pleasant outing. In the afternoon, male students A, B, C, and female student Yang Xiaofeng were chatting and laughing in the room, saying they were planning to go out to play and have tea, to see the women of Suzhou. Just as they were excitedly discussing and preparing to leave, the old painter suddenly appeared silently in the room. Seeing that the students only loved to fool around, and none of them were diligently painting, he immediately gave them a stern lecture. However, none of the male and female students wanted to listen to his theories and they all slipped away one by one! When he realized that there was no one in front of him listening to his art theory, he couldn't help but say with emotion, "Seeing the women of Suzhou" is much better than listening to an old man’s boring theories?</p>
<p>Suddenly, female student Xiaofeng turned back and, after asking why, realized that she couldn't go because her feet hurt from climbing the mountain in high heels that morning!</p>
<p>At this time, the old painter's hopes for his students were rekindled. He hoped that Xiaofeng could study painting well so that his art could be passed down. The clever Xiaofeng understood the old painter's intentions and recognized the old painter as her father because Xiaofeng's parents had already passed away.</p>
<p>The old painter was so happy he jumped up. The two went from being teacher and student to father and daughter. The old painter told Xiaofeng that he also used to have a lovely daughter who was lost during a warlord civil war. If she were still alive, she would be eighteen years old now! She was very smart since she was a child, and I remember teaching her four lines of Tang poetry when she was little: "Faintly, the long river flows; Leisurely, the traveler’s sentiment grows; Fallen flowers, though with regret, Fall to the earth without a sound." She learned it as soon as she heard it and sang it every day? Just as they were excitedly talking, a flower-selling girl suddenly ran in and interrupted their conversation! The old painter found it annoying and wanted to drive her out?</p>
<p>However, as the flower-selling girl was about to leave, she switched from the Suzhou dialect and recited the four lines of Tang poetry in the Beijing dialect: "Faintly, the long river flows; Leisurely, the traveler’s sentiment grows; Fallen flowers, though with regret, Fall to the earth without a sound." The old painter, touched by these four lines of Tang poetry, called her back and asked if she was from Beijing? And how she knew these four lines of Tang poetry. Who taught you? The flower girl told the old painter: "She used to have a painter father and a lovely mother. They lived in the suburbs of Beijing. That year, two warlords fought a civil war over territory, and their beautiful home was burned down by soldiers. Her father was said to have been burned to death at home. She and her mother could not survive in Beijing. Coincidentally, a fellow villager named Tang went to Suzhou to find her mother's sister, but the unfortunate are always unfortunate, and her mother's sister had already died! Of course, there was still no way to live, but thanks to the help of the Tang man, they managed to get by for a few more months. Later, the Tang man wanted her mother to marry him, promising to let her child study and receive education. Her mother, in order to fulfill her child's future happiness, sacrificed herself and married the Tang man. At first, the Tang man treated them well, but later, because her mother couldn't bear him a son, the Tang man took a concubine and abandoned them. Her mother, feeling deceived and sorry for her husband, became angry and died of illness. She is now a lonely girl who relies on selling flowers every day to support herself." Hearing this, the old painter knew that the flower girl was his lost daughter?</p>
<p>When the old painter told her that her father had not been burned to death by soldiers and that he was her father, the father and daughter hugged each other and cried. The daughter also told her father that her mother, when she was dying, still remembered her father's name and said she was sorry to him? At this time, Xiaofeng also knew that the flower girl was her sister.</p>

Ah, you lowly person. One whip. One scold. He waved his hand and sent her away without stopping. All I saw was her snowy skin and cloud-like hair in disarray. Her clothes were untidy, revealing her chest. Fengxi heard. Trembling. Her whole body was covered in sweat. There are ears on the other side of the wall to prevent awareness. How could there be no eavesdroppers outside the window. Who would have thought that the angry general heard these words. He suddenly smiled coldly two or three times. I understand everything in your heart. Could it be that a secret rendezvous continues the old romance. I think you, living in a humble alley, are of lowly status. Singing and playing the clapperboard to make a living. Now you haven't changed your usual ways. I'm just afraid that the fox's tail is still alive and showing its shape.

<p>Speaking of a way out, he also said that Mr. Wu Han had visited his home once a week after he was happily appointed as the section chief, meaning to introduce him to a position, but he politely declined. He said, "Mr. Wu Han, I will never forget this kindness."</p>
<p>Wu Cun's "Wind" has become fragmented because it has gone through too many "scissors." Now "Spring's Transformation" is facing the same fate. Prime Minister Zhang expressed sarcasm about the company by saying "Does this big company owe you money?", ordering it to be cut.

I eagerly want to see it first.</p>

<p>Film art is a "reflection" of reality. In this "peaceful world" where "sages are in power," it is admirable that films that "reflect the peaceful world" are being released!</p>
