<h3>紐倫堡的反蘇聯大會</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>一年一度的德國國社黨大會。自從九日在紐倫堡開慕以來。到現在已有數天了。在這幾天的大會中。除了表演它的雄厚的軍事力量外。就是國社黨領袖們連續不斷的發表醜詆蘇聯的激烈演說。所以这次的國社黨大會。實可以說是反蘇聯的大會。</p>
<p>就國際上的外交儀節說。不論兩國的衝突在實際上是怎樣的嚴重。但他們負責人員對外發表的語言。總是非常客氣的。这次紐倫堡大會中國社黨領袖們的公開醜詆蘇聯。實是罕見的事實。但我們從這些反臉的醜詆中。也可以看出反蘇聯運動的高漲。與德蘇衝突的嚴重了。</p>
<p>德國的東進政策。本是國社黨的重要外交政策之一。這東進外交政策的主要目標。就是社會中義的蘇聯。在過去數年中。德國不但在文字上而且在實際上。積極進行反蘇聯的運動。德國為什麽這樣熱情於反蘇聯運動呢。這是有許多的原因的。第一。就兩國所信奉的主義說。鮑爾雪維克主義與國社主義是完全不能並立的。德國宣傳部長不是在大會中說過。「鮑爾雪維克主義者。瘋狂犯罪之行為也」的話嗎。其决。蘇聯西部烏克蘭一帶的平原。是</p>
<p>一片肥沃的土地德國是時想染指的。德國國社黨外交組主任羅森堡早在他的「國社主義的基本結構」一書中說過。「給德國　民在東方（指蘇聯）的自由。是我國復興的全部某礎。」就是在这次大會中。希特勒也說過這樣的話。「假使德國有烏克蘭西此利亞以及烏克蘭的麥產地。則將優游自如。而無庸奮鬥以圖生存矣。」所以德國之熱情於反蘇聯運動。積極推進東進政策。原是想消滅社會主義的國家而攫取烏克蘭的肥沃土地啊。</p>
<p>上面是就德國反蘇聯政策的根本原因說的。至於國社黨領袖們在这次紐倫堡大會中用村婦駡街式的言詞醜詆蘇聯。却是另有對內對外的作用的。就對內的作用說。國社黨自從執政以後。雖已將四年之久。而對於國內經濟的問題。絲毫沒有解决的辦法。因此很引起人民的不滿。於是國社黨為轉移人民的視綫起見。乃不得不强化反蘇聯的運動。說德國人之所以不能「優遊自如。」就是為了沒有奪得烏克蘭的原因。至就劉外方面說。最近德國的宣布延長義務軍役時期以及積極擴充軍備。很引起英法等國的反響。於是希特勒就加强反蘇聯的運動。一方面藉以博得資本主義國家的同情。一方面則以之轉移他們直射於整軍備武上的視錢。紐倫堡的國社黨大會之所以變成為反蘇聯的大會。就是由於這種原因。</p>
<p>對於國社黨的這種攻繫與醜詆。蘇聯自然是不會緘默的。明决克紅軍的大操。實可以說是蘇聯對於紐倫堡反蘇聯大會的反攻。蘇聯國防人民委員長伏洛希羅夫向參加此决大操的軍隊說。「無敵的紅軍。已準備隨時在其本國領土之內。殲滅敵人。」更是對於國社黨束進政策的明顯警吿。我們觀於这次紐倫堡大會的性質。就可知德蘇的關係是一天緊張一天。而侵略集團與和平集團的對立形勢也一天尖銳一天了。</p>

<p>據希氏估計、目下其所部政治武力之力量、除陸軍之外、計有衝鋒隊二百萬名、黑衣衛隊二十六萬七千名、及共他隊伍二萬二千名、希氏續言曰、「世人對於吾入之極力反抵希爾希維克主義、似頗引以為異、其實係因吾人及意國、皆曾經歷與今日西班牙相同之情形、如一九二三年之紐倫堡、（希氏語時、手指遠處之烟突）曾有四千五百名退伍兵、列隊行經此間、被共產黨人所襲擊、又慕尼黑地方、在蘇維埃執政時代、曾有作質之人民多名、被布爾希維克黨人所槍决、其情形無異於今日之西班牙、今日之德國、已不復再懼布爾希維克主義之侵入、所可慮者、卽德國四圍之國家、目下正受此種布爾希維克毒燄之薰染、勢將一一受其害而後已、吾人對於此種情形、自不能袖手傍觀、須知吾人為歐洲之一國、在文化及商業上、均與各鄰國有聯帶關係、余敢信吾輩「野性的國社黨人」、終為歐洲最佳之人民也」云、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>法國陸軍副總參謀長希維斯格特將軍及浮勒明將軍云、「對於步兵及其他部隊動作時之堅毅與勇猛、以及降落傘家之膽氣、吾人有極强之印象、坦克車之動作則表現駕駛員之技巧純熟、吾人允特別注意及砲隊與騎兵所用馬匹狀况之極端良好、」浮氏續云、「吾人欣佩空軍列隊之秩序井然、尤特別注意驅逐機及高速度轟炸機、以及其駕駛員之熟練、」希氏結束時、並言及將近落成之明斯克紅軍兵營以及體育及文化設備等、對法代表團所引起之興趣、</p>
<p>英國代表領袖華維爾將軍云、「余深知舊俄軍隊、故余特別注意君等之進步、吾人欣佩貴國軍隊之健全以及其耐勞力、指揮人員之訓練水準使人獲極佳印象、貴國步兵坦克車及飛機技術上之發展、使吾人印象甚深、此方面君等無疑巳有極大成就、演習時戰鬥機之控制、證明戰鬥員技術知識及技巧之高、降落傘員亦表現驚人之勇敢·强毅·及良好訓練、」英國參謀部代表有名之坦克車問題著者馬泰爾上校云、「余必須承認、余親見之坦克車駕駛為優秀、在全部演習中、僅極小部份之坦克車、曾因工作或材料之阻礙在戰地被迫停止、飛機則全無意外降落及毀損、此事實令人深信貴國飛機與坦克車之優良、同時亦證明坦克車及飛行人員之技能高超、至於從飛機降落派遣隊之奇觀、吾人尚屬初决見到、降落時之良好秩序證實降落傘家之勇敢與精神高强、」（十三日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>國社當大會　希特勒閉幕辭　將宣布俄絕交乎</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒今晚將在紐倫堡發表重要官言、外問對此頗多猜測、或料希氏將宣佈與蘇俄斷絕外交關係、因德與立國原則根本與國社主義相反之國合作、不能有所裨益也、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）小日報頃載稱、德國國社黨大會、行將閉幕、該國元首希特勒、將於明日午後、發表最後一决演說、說明共產主義、若果挿足於該國邊界、斷難予以容忍、「此言若以較淺之外交辭令解釋之、乃謂法國若果發生共產黨革命、則德國新國防軍、卽常立卽以武力出而干涉」云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德俄關係緊張　英政界人士頗為焦慮</h3>

<h3>國棉豐收證實　紗廠開工　花貴紗賤將轉變　恢復昔年原市況</h3>
<p>花貴紗賤將轉變恢復昔年原市况自國內棉產估計豐收漸證實之後、棉業情形、頗有起色、新聲社記者特趨訪棉業界、探詢目前及將來之棉業情形如下、往年我國棉業不振之原因甚多、主要則為花貴紗賤、花貴原因在國內棉花缺少、紗賤原因在農村情形不好、紗布市况疲呆、此種情形、現在漸漸轉好、</p>
<p>國內棉花</p>
<p>今年甚好、前棉業統計會報吿產數、可達一千六百萬担、最近日本棉商東洋棉行、亦報吿有一千四五百萬担、看來總可在一千四百萬担以外、計算供求有餘、將來棉花價格、不致貴於棉紗、巳可决定、至於棉紗布市、自上年紗廠陸續减工停工之後、出產大减、近三四月來、紗布市情甚好、所以紗布存底、逐日减少、攘最近調查、上海現紗留存共計五萬八千餘包、較一月前須少一萬四千餘包、而减少之中華廠、</p>
<p>最多計減</p>
<p>一萬一千餘包、卽由於八月間紗銷暢起之故、現在上海中國紗廠所出之紗、共存五萬四千包、此中尙有二萬八千包在紗布交易所棧房中、在紗廠中者只有一萬六千餘包、數目極小、近數日閒紗布銷路甚好、並且紗廠賣出十月·十一月·十二月期貨甚多、故將來三四個月中紗布存留數、不致增多、今年各省農產、大都豐收、匪荒之地不多、紗布市銷頗有起色、卽將來新花上塲、紗廠</p>
<p>陸續開工、亦必能　出　銷、無積存之虞、紗賤花貴、不難變為紗貴花賤、轉變時期、大的在新花陸續上市之際、最近已漸漸有此種形勢、交易所開價、棉紗近高遠低、棉花近低遠高、卽是明證、但紗貴花賤之意、不過對已往紗賤花貴而言、並非花價獨跌或紗價獨漲、而是同漲時紗大花小、同跌時紗小花大、此種方向、係屬恢復昔年原有之市况、使紗花經濟地位、超於常軌而已、紗廠因此已形活動、停工各廠己多在準備開工、</p>
<p>上海方面</p>
<p>恒豐已决定開工、現己整理、申新二五及振華、亦均籌劃、漢口之震衰、己由常州大成紗廠開辦、漢口第一由漢口商人與九江利中紗廠聯合經營、惟民生因機件較舊、尙未决定、天津停工之賽成·裕元·北洋、由日人買去後、亦趕整開機、目今停工紗廠、尙有八十寓錠、如盡開工、可多用若干棉花、將豐收棉花减少餘剩、將來紗貴花賤、已轉變可望緩進、反之、則轉變驟急有如一十三年之情形云、</p>
<h3>銀錢兩業對　開徵所得稅意見　外商應同時實行免資金逃流　手續上因準備不及要求展緩　決推派代表謁主管人員陳述</h3>
<p>財政部設立中央直接稅籌備處、辦理徵收所得稅後、今所得稅第二類「蹬劵存欵所得、凡公債公司債股票及存欵利息之所得、」徵千分之五十、已定十月一日徵收、錢業同業公會經執行委員常會議决、將所得稅條文抄發各會員錢莊研究、倘有意見、請於一星期內貢獻到會、以便彙集辦理、銀行業同業公會於十二日下午二時、舉行執行委員常會、議决推定代表三人、謁徵收所得稅主管人員陳述意見、又新聲社記者昨向銀錢兩業探悉、茲分述如决、</p>
<p>銀行方面</p>
<p>（一）銀行辦理決算、每年分六月底及十二月底、對於各項存欵結息、均於决算時辦理之、今存欽利息所得稅、於十月一日實行、則各行勢必於九月底再辦理决算一次、今時已通近、手續上準備不及、所以希望政府對存欵利息所得稅、於明年一月一日與其他同時實行、呈請財部核奪緩期舉辦呈文、現正草擬中、今明日卽可遞呈、（二）對於同業往來存欵利息所得稅、例如甲銀行存乙銀行若干元、同時乙銀行存於甲銀行若干元、其利息所得稅、要求予以通融辦理、（三）外商銀行、應同時實行徵收存欵利息所得稅、否則華商銀行資金、勢必發生逃去之虞請注意及之、所以將推代表、謁中央直接稅籌備處長高秉坊·副處長梁和鈞·陳述意見請求採納、</p>
<p>錢業方面</p>
<p>對徵收存欵利息所得稅原則表示贊同、期望外商銀行同時實行、以免資金之逃流、但如何徵收認為有研究之必要、所以函各莊研究徵求意見、今决俟各莊意見彙集後、再行開會集議之、惟十月一日之實行、深恐準備不及云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （張皇）</p>
<p>齒達　耆，位居方面，而所　恒覺其稚，似去繞膝之日不遠。自有室家之好，而所親之一言一行，往日敬愛之惟恐不當者，漸趨老悻，　假而其身亦等贅疣。</p>
<p>新婦之不得於其姑樟，允弗慊於小姑小叔者，以其別人家女兒，為形勢所見外，姑創於上則小姑小叔仰承之，變本而加厲矣！阿家翁之率能痴聾處之者，娶婦之貲所自出，惜財以忍氣也。</p>
<p>父母之情，莫不欲其子女之並秀齋芳：有子不肯，則責其昆季之相周，庶幾其改之也。申博愛之情，而召溺愛之望。娌子壻之問，據理積漸而輒不相能，於是平輩相傾，而大傷其親之心！</p>
<h3>記革命耆宿尢列先生</h3>
<p>— 錢大</p>
<p>最近來滬之尢列先生，實為革命耆宿，淸季與孫總理陳少白楊鶴齡齊名，號稱四傑，為興中會最初之發起人，後與中會改組，為同盟會主盟於南洋一帶，海外華僑，為其開導革命者不可勝數，中華民國國號，卽係先生與總理在日本時所手定，迨武昌畢義，先生馳赴雲南，督促西南反正，全國景從，民國成立後，袁氏思以爵祿縻之，先生不為所動，反組救國軍聲討其罪，袁氏旣倒，先生遂退居香港，民國十年，總理開府廣州，就任非常總統，遺使再三徵之，先牛固辭不仕，今因年事已高，香港不適宜於調養，而立法院孫院長適亦有電請其北來一游，於是乘興搭輪來滬，稍事休息，再將游覽各地，以娛身心，先生現寓極司非而路十五號譚海秋君寓，筆者以譚君及尢先生秘書馬白眉君之介，曾謁先生於秋圃，’情先生以航途曾受風浪，精神未復，未能多談耳。馬白眉君以一影見示，影中五人，皆二十許之靑年，除其中一人筆者已忘其姓氏，餘四人卽先生與孫總理陳少白楊鶴齡也。該影為光緒十四年所攝，距今已數十年，此數十年中，人事之變遷何限，而先生當年之老友亦皆墓有宿草矣，吾知先生聞中苟撫此影，倘亦有滄桑之感乎。</p>
<h3>楊買辦</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>楊買辦，是我們弄裏的大房東。因為他從前，曾在某洋行中，當過三十餘年的買辦，現已吿老退休，而靠着收取全弄五十餘個石庫門的房租，以及若干股票的利息生活着，但大家還是呼之為楊買辦，</p>
<p>楊買辦，已是七十開外的人了，但是對於女色，却還是像少年時一樣·他本來自己住着一宅特建的三上三下的屋子，除樓上由大太太與子媳孫兒女等住居外，樓下是住着二房姨太太，一位是曾名震一時的紅倌人，一位是某女校未畢業的中學生。</p>
<p>前年，楊買辦曾與一位不怎麽有名的歌舞團的女明星，發生了關係，在外面租了金屋藏嬌着。去年，又輾轉地認識一位播音小姐，也給他勾搭上手了。今年，他索性史是老興勃發的大逛跳舞塲。他逛跳舞塲，是逛而不跳的。他自知年老氣于裏，要在舞池裏周旋？未免有些不濟了，所以他一進門，便總是包着舞女坐檯子。這麽着，便得到了不少舞女的擁護，而終於有一位才只十九歲的舞女，又列入了他的小星羣中了。</p>
<p>本來他擁有着一妻二妾。這三年中，又得手了三個，各在外面租着小公館，不相連屬，未免的往來有奔波之勞，而且也沒有照應，所以在最近，他把貼鄰二上二下屋子裏的房客趕走了，把三位新姨太太，搬居在一起以資便利。</p>
<p>他的朋友，見他處於這麽一大羣妻妾之間，却毫無衝突詬誶之聲，都佩服他的手段的高妙，而紛紛地向他請敎。他聽着，總是先掀髯大笑，然後頭頭是道的答道：「這有甚麽希罕的，老實吿訴你罷，伊們像花一般的人兒，難道還愛我這麽個老頭兒不成。伊們所愛的，無非是我的法幣而已。我逐一個投之以所好，自然的其餘問題，甚麽都迎刃而解了。」</p>
<p>據他說，「他的一生，曾娶妻一，娶妾十四。其他非正式的發生關係的，自己也有些記不淸了。一生的收入，一大半，也是消費在這上面的。現在是收入日蹙，所以已是不怎麽敢胡鬧了，」一</p>
<p>的確，這些年來，風聞得他已把這全弄的屋子押掉了。——但是他的　况，雖已不如以前了，但是他却還是每年娶一房姨太太哩。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第六回　鐵面見親心語瞞鸚鵡　蛾眉存俠氣問典崑崙</p>
<p>小菊將桌上的茶杯，分斟了兩杯茶，不說什麽，只是將嘴皮椐着笑起來。夢蘭道：你看這丫頭，也不知道他檢着了什麽値錢的東西，只管是傻笑。小菊道：我是偷聽嗎？我老早就在欄杆邊上坐着的。我只聽到兩位小姐唧唧咕咕的笑着說話，究竟說的是什麽，我也沒有聽到，他交代完了，放下茶壺，自走出去。却　着門，伸進半個頭，向兩人張望。而且眼看了友梅，却伸出一個食指，對夢蘭連連指了幾下。夢蘭笑道：滾卜樓去罷，鬼頭鬼腦的作什麽？小菊對人仲了</p>
<p>仲舌頭，自走了。友梅聽到樓梯叮咚叮咚響過了陣，便道：他已是走遠了，你有什麽話，可以吿訴我了。夢蘭將兩手撫摸了胸口，因皺　道：我要是能說，我早就對你說了，何必要你冉二再四的問。說畢，微微的　了　口氣。友梅兩隻手同搖起來，笑道：我不問你了，我不問你了，不要為了我問你的話，倒惹起了一身的毛病。夢蘭笑道。其　我並沒有心思，專對付那一個人談話。你儘管對我耳朶裏送了許多話來，但是我的心，　會注意在另一件事上。所以我微笑也好，歎氣也好，坐在我對面的人，儘可不必理會，我這種態度，倒是與當面的人無關。我也不知道我為什麽，要這種樣子。說一句時髦點子的話，也許是我沒有靈魂了吧？友梅，我很抱歉，對了你這樣好的朋友談話，我倒是愛聽不聽的。我未免在老友前失　。友梅笑道：你　　同抱歉赴來了。這樣說下去，小姐你眞可憐。非惹得我陪着你吊卜幾點眼淚不可！夢蘭道：我倒並不要你可憐我。要人可憐，那是種法懦的人做的事情。友梅笑道：越同你說着體己的話，你是牢騷越多。我不說了，你在家　好好的休息淸。說時，將手按在夢蘭的肩上，輕輕的拍了兩下。夢蘭道：怎麽　？你要走開嗎？友梅道：我覺得你精神恍惚，應該好好的休息一下。我在這裏，你不能不陪同說話，未免　了你的神。說時，手握了他的手，人向外面走了去。夢蘭也不怎樣的　留他，牽了他的手，一直送到房門口去。友梅走下了樓梯，還露着半截身體，又回　頭來，向夢　　　招了兩招手，夢　莫明其妙的對他笑了一笑，也沒有說其餘的話。友梅卜樓去了，夢　又有些戀戀不捨的意味，站着靠了樓欄杆邊，對下面望着。友梅站在天井裏，果然，又回　頭來笑道，不用發呆了，好好的去睡罷。（七四）</p>
<h3>駐顏術</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>友人每有以駐顏之術相問者，故作是篇以答之，其辭曰：</p>
<p>客有問於余者日！子年過四十，而顏貌丹渥，膚血充盈，望之如未逾二十者，吾甚惑焉！吾與子友二十年矣！而子不加老，否則髮之黑者斑矣；面之腴者皴矣！夫長生久視者，神仙家之妄談，返老還童者，科學醫之創獲，故美容有院，駐顏有方，子醫家也，將亦有所謂「秘密藏」乎？其術為何，願母終秘，予曰！唯唯，吾之術有以異乎人之銷，人之為術以藥石技巧求勝自然，而吾之為術則一順之自然而已，孔子曰！「人之生也直，枉之牛也幸而免，」夫生死壯老，人之常也，然而天下之以攝生無法而枉其生者，何可勝道哉？余幼而多病，體弱而孱，淸嬴之名，着於戚黨，其後負笈申江，專攻醫學，乃稍稍知攝生之道，於是起居動靜，咸有常規，飲食休息，均有定律，數十年來，始終如一，其術一也。余生性恬退，名利之見，淡然若忘，旣無心於仕途，復絕情於貨殖，雖無楚狂高蹈之操，而慕顏觸知足之義，以自給為富，以無求為貴，以淸靜為樂，以不辱為榮，故終身在樂觀之中，而悲觀之時則恒少，其術二也。余都無所嗜，唯好讀書，聲色於我為無緣，烟酒為我所厭惡，凡一切足以有害於身體之嗜好，皆一無所染焉！其術三也。夫俾畫作夜者，損神之大原，馳騖名利者，勞生之利器，縱情聲色者，伐性之雙斧，吾竊哀之。故駐顏之術，惟順自然，吾之為術，非怪非奇，老生常談而已；而世人不察，乃欲以藥石手術收不老之奇效，不亦舍本而逐末哉？客聞余言，恍若有悟，點首微嘆，再拜而去。</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>日暉港</h3>
<p>— 方屏藩</p>
<p>日暉港——這一個離都市不遠而一切逈異都市的村落。這裏沒有高大的洋房，平坦的柏油道，也沒有迷人的爵士音樂，和閃爍的年紅燈光，更沒有站在時代錢上的姑娘，過着布爾喬亞生活的少爺·………所謂「港」裏，根本沒有碩大無朋的軍艦，富麗堂皇的皇后輪，祇有首尾相啣從江北氽來的怪破舊的艒艒船</p>
<p>這裏聽不見密司或密司脫的呼聲，和“I　　Lvoe　　You”一類情調，衝進耳膜來的都是大三子，狗六子，……或是小雜種，你媽的鬼，敢，你敢！種種怪時。</p>
<p>兩岸除了幾架鉛皮蓋或的堆貨棧以外，其餘盡是不滿五尺高大的茅棚，他們都鑽爬似的過着棚戶生活，洗滌，飲料，都汲取於這一條黃泥湯似的而又含蓄着不可名狀的臭氣的港裏，『衛生』，當然談不到呀！</p>
<p>脂粉香更聞小到啦！在熱天，祇有勞動者的汁臭，和腐爛了的垃圾被太陽薰炙出來的異味。</p>
<p>克羅咪色的司蒂培克轎車偶然經過，司機人都拉足了馬達奔得很快，深恐稍慢了便要染上穢氣，車廂裏的太太小姐們，更用手怕捻緊了鼻子。</p>
<p>晚上是靜得可以，白天也不見熱鬧，住在這草棚裏的壯健者，去挽洋車，幼小的，負了筐做垃圾檢查員，婦女也有伊們的職業，——縫裙，捉牙蟲。</p>
<p>這寂寞而又冷落的村落裏，固然不能到莫干山去避暑，到青暘港看並頭蓮，但有時也會得到幾位藝術家的光顧，把這原始時代遺型的貧民窟來做畫的資料，用輕鬆的筆意，搬上了畫架，可是在他們的筆底下，——且是幾間金黃的茅屋，一灣淸碧的流水，爪皮艇兒，白鵝，全幅充了詩意。</p>
<p>『誠然，美麗的畫家的頭腦』。</p>
<p>這一個東方巴黎外衛的日暉港！</p>

<h3>證券　公債多方略有掉期</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市况依然呆滯不動、數星期以來、始終盤旋、不離故轍、市塲淸淡狀況、令人生厭、環境幷無變化、塲上祇有散戶略有掉期交易應市、故市價仍未能振作、交易亦不易增盛、昨日經過、上午兩盤、多方略有掉期、市價略見疲軟、但　盤仍祇五分一角上落、午後交易已淸、開盤略好五分、收盤可略小五分、似此一再　旋、本月交　巳無形大為减少、故前途恐亦未必有傾軋之風也、市價結果、除本月九六獨漲五分外、餘則均略小五分一角云云成交總數、共計三百三十七萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　粗紗銷路雖旺　標紗一再挫跌</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、因海外紗花狀况平靜而現紗銷路益覺良好、南方進意甚濃、對於粗紗進胃愈强、故有一部份逢低時傾向購進、然外商心思看跌、曁一般業外投機家拋賣甚夥、市盤受其壓迫矣、</p>
<p>金鷄又跌一元左右</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月呈呆滯平庸之象、但塲中交易甚淸、除本月勿動、遠月跌三四五角、二盤續挫三四角、詎料三盤、聞現紗南方進意甚殷、且粗紗銷路更旺、人心重振、遠月跳起七八角至一元二角、但長豐·大字·潤康·拋賣允湧、迨至收盤、又復回小數角、惟德大·裕大則補空較夥、標紗結果近月比上日收盤價跌四角、遠漲二三角、午後開盤、本月回漲、然拍至遠月平凡、二盤以後、散戶步步拋賣、市况下降、結果各月比上午收盤價跌五七八九角、查賣出大孚一千四百包、華懋一千包、長豐五千六百包、潤康一千五百包、生源一千七百五十包、通記一千八百包、裕大一千二百包、森康三千四百五十包、大昶一千包、買進同和八百包、德大一千九百五十包、大豐一千四百包、賡豐一千四百包、望泰興一千三百包、益關九百包、協成一千三百包、泰昌七百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>廠商已在搶辦新花</h3>
<p>棉市始漲繼疲、形勢漸現盤旋狀態、蓋以外棉穩定、印棉甚堅、現棉新貨廠方搶進市勢益緊、惟今庚年成豐稔、一般業外投機家傾向拋賣、長和賣勢允熾、惟午後稍有買回云、</p>
<p>標花漲後又回</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因天氣良好、上日被大戶猛烈拋賣、檯面鬆濫、市况暗淡無神、跌五分至一角、拍至遠月轉定、二盤近平、遠期上漲、市塲說者許美棉雖平、卽棉大漲二羅比至三羅比七五、大阪三品花平靜、碼頭到貨未旺、各廠又有搶新舉動、姚花·通州售價喊漲一元、於是市氣頓緊、買風忽熾、各月跳二·三角但長和仍來大量拋出、合興·華懋·大昶賣出亦夥、收盤又復回小、惟大孚·明德·大昌成·潤康·福康·晋康·源興昌·永昌多頭加碼、空頭抵補、雙方並起、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角至一角半、午後開盤、天有變象、買氣尙挺、繼以紗平不振、天時轉好而挫、結果各月比上午收盤價回跌一角至三角、查賣出長和三千八百担、振大二千四百担、森康二千五百担、新昶二千二百担、大昶三千二百扣、華懋三千六百担、合興三千担、福康三千五百担、買進益昶二千五百祖、大孚千二百担、明德二千一百担、大昌成二千担、長豐二千四百担、潤康五千九百担、永昌二千一百担、源興昌三千三百担、仁豐二千三百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>漢埠新花上市頗湧　成交亦暢</h3>
<p>漢口通信、本埠棉花市况、因今庚年成　稔、各路來源雖見踴躍、然檢騐標準提高、不及格者甚夥、水分太多、故檳棄市外、未能上市售開、銷塲方面、各紗廠以陳棉存貨枯弱、急切盼望新棉需要、對於新棉購辦較多、申稱出口商亦紛紛搶進、同時日商洋行派人在四鄕產區搜羅、因此市面情形尙稱熱鬧、市價上漲數角、本日裕華申新等紗廠共進一千八百十五包、折合市秤為九百九十七担又九十斤、茲將現花成交情形、摘錄如下、</p>
<h3>印棉交易頗為暢達</h3>
<p>上週美棉銳漲、孟買方面買方、未在高峯時、追隨美棉、奧姆辣及平果爾交易暢達、大半係輸往日本之大戶所做、大陸方面對於印棉之興味、殊為淡薄、蘭開夏之需要、僅限於加拉齊新花、週內季候雨更形順利、白羅溪及古巨拉兩地已獲得普遍益雨、因之棉收有進步現象、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>三品紗花昨市略小</h3>
<p>十四日大阪電、三品期棉跌一角五五分、近月為六十六元、遠月為六十四分、期紗跌五角至一元六角、近月為二百十四元二角、遠月為二百零三元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布南北銷塲仍旺　現貨依然甚感缺乏　色布銷路最覺暢達</h3>
<p>昨棉布市態穩健、以紗花市面雖微見鬆懈、然棉布因現貨供給缺乏、各路催促定貨急迫、及津粵南北二大帮突起湧辦、各廠已見難以應付、設滇貴動銷、各貨將益見匱乏、故廠商態度、非常鎭定、昨東疋細布原布微挫每疋二分半之譜、因紗花影響及染廠需要仍呆之故、花色貨·印花色丁·直貢·嗶嘰·銷路十分暢旺、以山東·河南·陝西為允佳、各廠新花樣一裝數十箱、隨售隨罄、印花絨·白絨·彩條絨·白法絨等絨貨、以氣候漸　、各路需貨日亟、各廠出品每日益見增多、市面平平、英商怡和廠輕磅粗布存貨日减、市上需要加繁、頗見緊俏、華商各廠輕重磅粗布·細布·細斜出數大减、乃因色貨需要奇旺、改織坯子布之故、咋內地帮及冀、魯·陝·豫·兩廣諸帮採辦各貨最為活躍云、</p>
<h3>秋涼天氣呢絨當令</h3>
<p>近日巳屆秋令、天氣漸凉、各種毛貨呢絨、均及時暢銷、本街容帮賡續添辦甚殷、中西服裝。男女色厚薄毛織品、逐日有大批開出、昨人字呢·麥爾登·平厚呢·中厚嗶嘰·新艷花色貨等、趨勢較優、走銷暢旺、標準行盤堅漲、昨普通牌子麥爾登呢、躉批每碼沽二元四角半、寳達人字呢二元二角半、瑞文貨四元七角半、寳達平厚呢二元六角半、華波一〇八〇號二元七角、聯歡圖中厚嗶嘰五元二角半、聯歡圖二二〇深色高條花呢五元五角、又八十五號為五元凈盤云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市前途恐成僵局</h3>
<p>昨日本埠絲市、殊覺淸堅、雖橫濱絲價續漲、（現貨漲五元·期貨漲八元）、但洋莊絲市、般洋商仍取觀望、昨僅怡和信孚有少數購進、市盤大致如前、用戶方面行盤亦未有上落、但因絲商持價趨堅、致乏購者、因之交易甚為寥寥、如昨某綢廠開白廠B字二〇·二二條份價六一五元、雖進胃包額隨巨，但仍無售者、觀察現今絲市、賣方似不願一再遷就、而買方亦似難以昻價成交、致目前中外絲銷、似又同趨僵局矣</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日祁門紅茶、略有走動、錦　拈孖治等行、均略有進、頂盤售開六十一元、聞怡和協和等行、鑒於現市茶價相宜、頗多電報發出、市情已在醞釀進展中、至綠茶交易、依然清淡、僅英商同孚保昌等行、對於葉底優良珍眉、稍有進胃、低荘次貨、銷路非常呆滯、暢滯頗有不一云、</p>
<p>又據茶　公會報吿云、綠茶市面、因到茶旣少、存底亦不厚、上品質高新寥寥、各行自呈懈淡、所去外洋兜銷之當、大都無轉音、以致市面異常淸靜、日昨僅恊和略進屯溪小針眉七十餘箱、價四十二元、及華荼進抽珍數十　，價八十元至百零五元、其餘珍眉貢熙及平水各茶、交易極淸云、</p>
<h3>八月份生絲出口報告　輸出銳减……市况疲滯</h3>
<p>據賽業部上海商品檢驗局報告、八月份華絲出口計輸往美洲一、三〇〇包、輸往歐洲一、四九〇包、非洲三二一包、亞洲一九三包、以類別言、計輸出白廠絲二·六三七包、輯里及白土絲二〇〇包、黃廠絲五包、黃經及黃土絲二七六包、灰經六四包、及雙宮絲一二二包、此外廢絲輸出計二·九二六包、又本年新絲上塲以來、（六月份起）、三個月間華絲出口總數為一六、〇九〇包、較之去年同期之二一、七六〇包、計减少五、六七〇包、</p>
<p>本月份絲市始尙堅穩、繼受外銷淸淡、而走入疲滯、絲價因此頻跌、蓋數月來國內絲市、以紐的橫濱等市塲升降靡定、外電與國內市價恒差三五十元之巨、市氣以致常呈僵持狀態、幸內銷去胃尙稱活躍、一般心思異常奮興、雖洋莊走銷不旺、市價尙能持穩、根基似頗安定、這入八月、洋莊依呈僵持局面、因此一般心思無不引為前途隱憂、加以本月為大宗期貨了結之期、洋莊實銷仍然呆滯、市面多頭浮擠、市氣日見萎頓、惟據一般觀察、歐美銷路如能發動、市况回復、亦不無希望也、</p>
<p>八月份華絲輸出數量統計、單位包、</p>
<h3>五金　日五金　平與歐美爭雄　昨已裝來萬餘擔</h3>
<p>生駒丸昨由大阪裝來金屬品共達一萬餘擔、卸　菱公司碼頭、中三尺六尺三張至十張黑鐵皮二千札、小白鐵六百五十箱、新鉛絲一千二百件、薄鋼板二千張、洋元鐵四百五十件、三角鐵一千八百條、元釘·花園鉛絲各四百餘件、小白鐵為美國出品由日轉口者外、其他各項五金、悉為大阪·八幡·中山等日廠之出品、蓋日商以各種貨品均有凌駕歐美之勢、惟獨五金、讓歐美獨步、故决心來華競爭、此後尙有大批五金品裝來、恐歐美各國貨品均將受其打擊云、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油似無再跌可能</h3>
<p>白桐油自一落千丈後、一蹶不振、近月來漢市盤旋於每担五十五六元之問、極為平穩、雖一度會漲至六十二元、但亦曇花一現、日來市况、愈覺岑寂、擴漢口函訊、各洋行均抱觀望態度、卽有交易、亦　數十噸而已、實不足引起市塲之興奮、惟行情已小至如此地步、故縱久無交易、諒無再跌可能、且各產區存數均薄、距新貨尙有兩月、執貨者當亦不欲急於求售也、照現市觀察、似巳人於易漲難跌之境矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子歉收頻漲不已　首批新泉圓運到二千餘件</h3>
<p>黑瓜子今庚因秋汛貨歉收、出數大為减少、故徐州產價一再步漲、前後已什四元許、昨據大成號快函連日到貨極缺、查總產數巳十去七八、且屯戶積存亦屬有限、最後市頗有大　希望、照業中人預測、如徐魁子十元一關似可達到、又據臨淮關明光訊、該處小式瓜子亦漲近元、此間號盤逐見上展、如　莊子開過一十一元外、其餘均堅俏少出云、</p>
<p>首批新泉州大泡圓、咋已出永陞輪運到二千餘件、其中大式貨聞成本達四上元、大約今明日可以見樣、開盤趨勢、以到貨激增有鬆象、</p>
<h3>糧食　實銷　近期粉市落之狀</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈先定、繼則鬆跌之象、以洋麥　價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、仍微好四八分至一角零、惟市塲人心、因目下實銷、實在不暢、各廠存底、步步增楨、在此環境之下、卽有實力、亦不能頑檳、故開價雖定、繼則步鬆、較前週收盤、回落一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、各月份市氣、依然無神、因廠方鑒於去路不活、陸續套賣樣凖、故人心步軟、惟內地廠微有補空、稍稍抬住、業中人推測、以為銷路始終呆木、近期粉有挫落之勢云、</p>
<h3>期麥又跌七八分　粉銷不振之故</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份尙見平靜、以洋麥報價微好、市塲之套賣不多、一部分浮空、仍有抵進、故各月份喊價、祇較前週小去二三分、迨至下午開盤、交易　淸、市則鬆落、因粉市不振、實銷甚寂、故喊價又帶落三五分、徒以多頭硬擯、新空戶又少、交易遂反稀淡耳、現麥市面仍然平穩、未見出入、開山東五河麥九元零五分、瑤灣沙河集宿州麥五元、高郵麥四元八角半、决八角、江北宿遷麥四元八角二分、沙市麥四元五角二分、湖南麥四元五角、淮安麥四元七角六分、漢口麥高四元八角、次六角、又次五角一分、由福新去八千包、申大去一千五百包云、</p>
<h3>客秈到貨仍湧　行情依然疲滯</h3>
<p>昨客秈到頭仍旺、市上存底允充、而來源依然不絕、途貨亦復源源抵埠、故貨主心思甚虛、極　　價求售、昨粵　辦　復起、市面突形活　、漢口糙米成交一萬四千包、統為粵帮辦去、汕頭帮胃口亦香、本街亦活、惟貨主求售甚力、行情未能拾級上升倘今後去化仍見旺暢不絕、則後市卽可步砌也、昨開出江西米二千餘包、湘米一千二百包、漢糙一萬四千包、江北糙六百包、粵秈二千包、</p>
<h3>河下米走銷仍無起色</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍袛十二三號、貨共二千四五百石、而零銷猶呆、包胃靑島大速帮辦簿稻有五六百包、故如厚早粳價續低幾分、簿稻定局、東新粳亦無榮辱、新羊蘆等尖再小五分、陰變元平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路平源三十四五號、市上各貨去胃短價拾巧銷取、市形破粳高貨修近角、中次小一二角、新羊尖殺跌二三角、新埠尖·變元·薄稻·陳洋尖亦小幾分至一角左右、新團尖貨銷價平、東西新粳　相仿、新客尖價疲近角、</p>
<h3>特載　答蚌埠義興公司丁人君問</h3>
<p>（一）利物浦（卽漢麥）每一單位為匹克、計一百十二磅、二十個匹克為一噸、（計二千二百四十磅）合市秤二千〇三十二斤</p>
<p>芝加哥（卽美麥）每一單位為　式耳計六十磅每三三·三三蒲式耳為一噸、（計二千磅）合市秤一千八百十四·二四斤、坎拿大同上、</p>
<p>（二）報上所載英美金行市係以國幣一元或百元計算、照此換算可也、</p>
<p>（三）訂購洋麥之費用、間有上落、就通常之習愼、當成交時、以CIFC卽包括水脚保險及訂定之麥價一切在內、祇須卸貨地點、由訂購檢騐收貨、至若FOB係在產麥地點裝船為止、不涉其餘各項、至於CIFC與FOB大的每噸之差別、為十七先令、兩　之間、純以訂購者之意思為意思、對於運費水脚等情、可就此數、細為推算、卽可明瞭耳、</p>
<p>（四）洋麥之市價、均屬標準、其情形與我國交易所之標準相仿、因現貨之品質高次不同、定價當然殊異、猶如我國之小麥、市値有時超過標準、有時反是、卽各種現貨、高與决之間、亦有差至三五角者、故問其名而不問其實、為經營者所應知也、</p>
<p>（五）關於詢問事項、筆者在可能範圍、不厭求詳、惟細瑣之事、實無答復之必要、祈諒察焉、</p>

<h3>廚師底權威（上）</h3>
<p>— 黃貽淸</p>
<p>（五）生殺之權，盡在掌握</p>
<p>一吃了我的東西撐病，和我自己撐病一樣，我卻沒臉」這是從前死在歐戰裏的一個德國人，青島提督樓飯店老板伍樂福請的。所以他督促手下各廚師，技師的保持清潔，無徵不至：甚至鍝釜非在每天晩上用沙皮擦得光亮簇新不可，用通常的擦爐灰還嫌髒。「人飢已飢」，「人溺已溺」，一個廚師有這般風度，可見彼邦人士底責任心和國民道德了。</p>
<p>事實上我們試一回想：「某某的死是吃了某餐得病，這類的話，常有所聞。要像民國八九年問，杭州某校鬧着飯鍋裏撒毒藥一案，廚師底權威自然分外覺得偉大。一本美國小學衛生書上說的「廚師底工作比大多數律師，醫師，公務員和敎師還重要」，一絲不錯。因為：的確！廚師祗要一個不小心，食物裏搭染了些致病生物，怪會斷送家主或顧客底性命的。換句話說，「魚藏劍」的活劇，在社會上到處可以看到，不容專諸專美就是。</p>
<p>在我國專制時代，羹調「鹽梅」，本是比喻經天緯地，相度治理的佳話。可是從前祇知道他在積極方面，尤其在調味上，促進食慾上，有這麽重要。現在衛生法理昌明了，廚師和飯頭身上，却被加給了三樁消　方面的重大職權樁就是食物成分的支配，要支配的得當，敎喫的人喫了夠滋養，不致濨養不足，或是害各種養素缺乏病；一樁就是食物淸潔的保障，要保障得穏妥，敎　的人喫了不致害各種汚穢病和腸寄生蟲病：還有一樁，就是食物易消化性的料理，要料理得周到，敎喫的人喫了不致妨害消化，害消化不良。而情勢挺嚴重，挺緊急的，要算第二椿</p>
<p>要避免第二椿的意外過失，作者這裏倒有兩個常之又常的訣門，要請我可敬的廚師們注意！同時，要請任用廚師的人們留心檢察着！</p>
<p>一個叫做　「火到豬頭爛」；　一個叫做　「老不擔錯的是乾凈」。</p>
<h3>從世運失敗說到全身健康檢查</h3>
<p>— 古鴻烈</p>
<p>本年八月間，德京柏林舉行之世運大會，可謂為民族健康之比賽，誰有健全偉大之體格，卽誰有奪錦標之把提。出席之各國選手，自皆為各國運動之健將。我國選手，當歡送出國時，滿擬奪錦標，榮祖國，孰知自開慕迄閉慕，電訊傳來，各國選手，均獲金牌銀牌銅牌以俱歸，獨我國則空無所有，謔者謂為吃了一個大鴨蛋。或有責吾國選手之不爭氣，不拚命者，實則體格不偉大，氣力不如人，乃此决世運中我國失敗之致命傷，未可不顧事實，厚誣選手也。根據歷年統計，國人之身體，日漸縮小，同時壽命亦逐漸减短，若與東鄰日本相比較，彼昔日固常被稱為矮國者，然近數十年來，因政府當局注意民族健康，勵行健康配偶，彼邦人民之身體，已一代比一代壯大，壽命亦一代比一代延長，故吾國整個民族，苟不注意健康檢查，與健康配偶，甚至明知對方患有能遺傳後代之疾病，亦因地位關係，而勉强配合，語云種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆，此為必然之理，以不健康之配偶，其所傳之後代，當然决不健康，若國人長此不知醒悟，則東亞病夫之誚，將永無洗刷之日，正不獨世運之遭淘汰為可恥而巳也。此决世運中，我國足球隊之表演，頗博得深刻與準確之批評，謂上半時將和，下半時中國將負二球，結果果如所料，蓋技術固然要好，而勝負最後之判，則尙以體力能吾持久為關鍵。不佞今年服務於虹橋療養院，因世運中我國之慘敗，及虹院之舉行全身健康檢查，深覺有下列諸種感想。</p>
<p>全身檢查，為個人，為家庭，為社會，為國家，均屬刻不容緩之舉。蓋檢查後可以發現許多不自覺性之疾患，現代醫藥衛生之進步，一日千里，一般人士，均知醫病不如防病，而早期醫治，又勝於呼號於病發不可收拾之時，以余十載以來之經騐，凡進院求醫之病人，常發現其他疾患，同時並進，而病者尙不自知共隱患之已深，生命之日促，猶懵然望治，至於不救而後已。嗚呼，若此類之犧牲於不知早期施行全身檢查者，正未可悉數也。</p>
<p>檢查之手續，先從普遍的全身狀態，加以測騐，然後按序而及於各個器官，體溫脈搏呼吸是否正常，血壓有無增高，體重體長與年齡相較，是否適合標準之數目，營養是否充足，發育是否完全，均不難一檢卽知。</p>
<p>至於各個器官，如皮膚有無疾病，有之其因何在，蓋皮膚病有內發與外患之分，眼之視力如何，有最普遍之砂眼吾，耳之聽力如何，有流膿吾，鼻內是否正常，呼吸氣道有無障礙，齒為消化食物之第一道器官？是否整齊堅固，喉部如何，扁桃腺有無發大，頸部有無淋巴腺腫大，甲狀腺正常吾，胸部之心臟地位大小聲音正常吾，肺部之叩音聽音正常吾，腹部脾肝腸胃等之地位及功用如常否，生殖器法育是吾健全，有無疝氣，全身之姿勢有吾失常，有之應加矯治，凡此亦均可由檢查而知。</p>
<p>共他如血球之沉降快慢，能定全身抵抗力之强弱，萬氏血淸反應，能知體內梅毒之有無，小便之檢查，能知體內物質代謝之變化，大便之檢查，可知有無寄生蟲之存在，痰液之檢查，能知癆菌之有無，血液之厚薄，在指頭耳朵採血數滴，便知究竟，此亦皆為對於全身健康所應注意者。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼疾病衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一〇一）何謂色盲</p>
<p>人類之兩眼。可以識別五顏六色　　完全是因為眼底　膜具有一種　別色彩機能的緣故。這種機能在醫學上。特稱之日色覺。網膜視細胞中專司色覺的。是圓錐體。允以在網膜黃斑部附近的圓錐體為最多。所以它的色覺。亦最銳敏。反之。若在網膜邊綠部。則色覺遲鈍。對於紅綠的色覺。允感缺乏。這種色覺如若陷於减弱，或消失的狀態。則稱之曰色盲。照醫學上說起來。色盲可以別為先天性及後天性的兩種。卽</p>
<p>（一）先天性色盲——多因發育不全而起。</p>
<p>（二）後天性色盲——概因網膜，脈絡膜，及視神經疾患等等而發。茲特將此二者，分述如左。　　（一）先天性色盲——先天性色盲通常兩眼併發。它的程度。殊有不同。有深有淺。程度淺的時候。則患者對於顏色的辨別。稍覺困難。常常猶疑不决。程度深的時候。則患者對於顏色（或紅或綠）的辨別。殆屬完全不能。但是色盲患者，自己往往不覺有何障　。須待檢查體格的時候。方可發覺證明。色覺完全缺損者。稱曰全色盲。色覺全部减弱者。全色弱。紅綠色覺缺損而藍黃色覺健全者。稱曰紅綠色盲。輕度者。稱曰紅綠色弱。其中紅綠色盲與紅綠色弱。更可各分為二。就是紅色盲與綠色盲及紅色弱與綠色弱。</p>
<p>全色盲及全色弱，均為稀有的眼病。全色盲的病眼。完全不能感色。以致一切物體。均呈灰色。雖有明暗濃淡。但無色彩。有時且訴羞明。並來眼球震盪症。兩親血族結婚者，居多。全色弱者，就是指紅綠色覺與藍黃色覺同時减弱而言</p>
<p>紅綠色盲是色覺障礙中，最常見的一種。男子患此病的。的有百分之四。五。女子患此病的，的合男子的十分之一。並有遺傳的關係</p>
<p>（二）後天性色盲——在各種眼病的時候。色視野常可發生缺損。此時大都伴有視力障礙及視野中央或邊綠部缺損。一般在視神經疾患的時候。則有赤及綠的色覺，發生障礙。視赤色為暗赤色。視綠色為綠灰色。在網膜及脈絡膜疾患的時候。則有藍黃色先被侵害。視藍色為黑色或綠色。視黃色為白色或灰色。</p>
<p>色盲的危險——講到色盲的危險。是完全由於職業的關係而有不同。尋常職業如醫師，律師，會計師，工程師，以及服務銀行界，政界，商界等等。若歡色盲。則尙無多大妨礙。至於畫師，及與顏料有關係的職業。則已感覺不便。妨礙工作。最有危險性的。當為船長，引港，飛機師，駕駛火車，及駕駛汽車等等職業。蓋因此等職業。若忠色盲。則管理交通的紅綠燈。立卽失却效用。於是隨時隨刻可以發牛危險。所以在此等職業施行體格檢查的時候。必須特別嚴密檢騐有無色盲。若有發現。則應改就共他職業。决不可有所通融啊。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（九十二）膀胱異物和結石</p>
<p>（問）膀胱內怎樣會有異物存在？</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>（答）因為有時導尿管揷入不愼折斷或不當心因玩弄而揷入小物，致停留在膀胱內。</p>
<p>（問）膀胱異物有什麼危險？</p>
<p>（答）往往為膀胱出血的主要原因或漸漸使膀胱成潰瘍。也能成為膀胱結石的中心核。</p>
<p>（問）膀胱內的結石，是怎樣成立的？</p>
<p>（答）答以腎石下降為主因或因異物的存在做中心核而由鹼性尿的分解，致燐酸石灰尿酸錏等附着其上，逐漸變大。</p>
<p>（問）膀胱結石的成分，燐酸鹽和尿酸鹽，那一種居多？</p>
<p>（答）普通以燐酸鹽，結石居多。</p>
<p>（問）患膀胱結石的人，和年齡有關係嗎？</p>
<p>（答）老人很多。小兒也有的。</p>
<p>（問）和性別有關係嗎？</p>
<p>（答）男子比女子為多。</p>
<p>（問）發生膀胱結石的時候，起什麼症狀？</p>
<p>（答）疼痛是主要的症狀，放散於直腸和龜頭部分。其决是排尿障碍，洩尿中絕。又起血尿。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣診斷？</p>
<p>（答）對於疼痛等，祇有行對症療法以暫時制止其疼痛。根治法，須行外科手術卽碎石術採石術等。</p>
<p>（問）在膀胱結石未發生之前，怎樣可以預知尿中有燐酸石灰等鹽類？</p>
<p>（答）凡尿中常常溷濁，便可以斷定有石灰鹽類，這是結石的成立要素，應該及早注意。</p>
<h3>國產之藥用植物（續）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>五，益母草　Leonurus　sibiricus，L．</p>
<p>（植物）自生於原野，一年草也。莖高的一—一·五公尺，全株無毛者有之，或生有細毛者有之。葉有長柄，羽狀深裂，裂片作綫形。葉腋問着輪繖花序，夏日開紅紫色唇形花。瘦果有三稜。</p>
<p>（生藥）益母草（芜蔚）Heaba　Leonri，係採集帶花之全草而乾燥之者也。</p>
<p>芫蔚子Semen　Leonuri，乃採集共種子者也。木品表面，呈灰黑色，作稍長形之粒子，有三稜，長不過二公厘。</p>
<p>益母草有治婦人病有效之意。同屬植物L.Cordiacus,　　L.在美國稱為Lotherwort，同為婦科用藥。</p>
<p>（成分）葉含有Leonuri結晶性物質，脂肪油〇·五％，有惡臭之腦分，樹脂等。又最近日人久保田，中島兩氏分離得有Ci3H2oN4O4組成之結晶性Alkaloid，命名為Leonurin。</p>
<p>（藥理）以Leonurin注射於二十日鼠之皮下，霎時發生間代性痙孿，呼吸减弱，其决引起全身麻痺，因而呼吸靜比。呼吸靜止後，心臟仍繼續搏動。對體重一公分之二十日鼠，其最小致死量為〇·六—〇·七公絲。更以Lnurin，施於家兔之摘出子宮，則顯著增加其緊張性，並使子宮運動之度數增加。又呈利尿作用。</p>
<p>(藥用）舊說：益母草為婦入產後止血，補精藥，一回用量四—六公分，作煎劑。芫蔚子亦為利尿藥，又可治眼疾，作煎劑用。</p>
<p>明目，益精，除水氣，治風，解熱，順氣。調女人經脈，崩中帶下，產後胎前諸病，久服令人有子。</p>

<h3>和尚不受公民訓練</h3>
<p>— 無决</p>
<p>和尙在某一個時候，是被人稱之為「賊禿」的，但這頭銜實在太籠統。因為，不一定每個和尙都是「賊禿」，所以他們卽使一天到晚唸經，也還不被擯於公民之外。不過義務與權利是對立的；和尙們旣然取得了公民的權利，自然是要盡公民的義務的，而去受公民訓練，也就是盡公民義務之一。可是現在有一位太虛法師却呈請政府取消公民訓練理由是：</p>
<p>「佛家以慈悲為懷，以殺生為戒，若使終日唸經和尙，操干戈而從事戰地生活，恐不能勝任，是以呈請取消，而授以相當之救護知識，一旦有事，使任後方看護之職，當能勝任愉快，並可於看護餘暇，宣傳敎旨，一舉兩得，莫良於此！」</p>
<p>這是什麽話！在和尙們看來，這的確是一舉兩得的，但我們的意見，却以為非但不能「兩得」而且「數失」，甚至要「同歸於盡」！為什麽呢？佛家旣以慈悲為懷，以殺牛為戒，當然對外來的侵略，是抱不抵抗的「受難」主義，卽使敵人把槍口料着他胸膛，他也不會回手，萬一回手弄傷了敵人，豈不要動搖詞悲的信念，干犯殺牛的戒條麽？</p>
<p>但現在的人心終究不古了；慈悲戒殺，雖是好聽的名辭，可也和和平一樣，祇成為一個名辭而已。任你怎樣慈悲，也打不動人家的殘忍，理由很簡單，要生存只有奮鬥，不奮鬥就只有死。所以讀了太虛法師這個提議，我就根替和尙們躭心，因為照這情形下去，不見得是和尙們的福利。縱然和尙們個個都有「受難」的精神，雖死無怨，但對於國家和民族，也只徒作無謂的犧牲！</p>
<p>然而危險的稈度還不止此，照太虛法師的說法，最好是授和尙們以救護的知識，使任後方看護，並可於看護餘暇，官傳敎旨。現在姑無論和尙對於看護這一門功課是否眞能夠勝任愉快，因為我們知道最好的護是女人，要呌粗手笨腳的和尚去做女人的工作，總有點格格不入。而最要不得的就是「宣傳敎旨！」信敎雖是個人的自由，但在這個民族意識需要昂揚的時候，卻去對那些「執干戈以衛社稷」的兵士宣傳佛家的出世思想，去呌他們「以慈悲為懷」「以殺生為戒」，不是存心要陷中華民族於萬刦不復的地位去受人宰割嗎？</p>
<p>我們雖然不欲故入人罪，但對於太虛法師這樣不近現實的理論，認為卽使言出無心，但也有變為漢奸的形跡。我們愛太虛，愛和我們同舟共濟的和尙，覺得這「宣傳敎旨」是　　要不得的。</p>
<p>卽退一百步來講，我們承認和尚可以不受公民訓練，可以不從事戰地生涯但也不能去常看護，更萬萬不能「於看護餘睱」，為了要「一　兩得」而去「宣傳敎旨」的。</p>
<h3>中國四大油廠之一　立德榨油廠參觀記</h3>
<p>— 錫山</p>
<p>（本報特寫）中國的榨油事業，它在每年對外貿易的商品輸出上，頗佔重要的地位。所以過去的幾年中，榨油是一樁很發達的工業，可是於目前百業都遭不景氣潮的波及之下，許多的榨油業工廠，也同樣地受到了重大的打擊。我為了希冀對於目前的榨油業，得到一些大概的情形起見，在昨天，特赴西蘇州河路的立德榨油廠參觀。</p>
<p>立德油廠，為中國四大油廠之一。自創設以來，有着頗久遠的歷史，所以內部的規模，也相當的宏大。當我去參觀時，由該廠主任劉君自行招待，先將我引進了會客室，暫作了幾分鐘的休息</p>
<p>在會客室的四壁，對於中國榨油業每年生產額及出口額的統計報吿表格，懸掛很多。據最近的統計，在上海一隅，大小的榨油廠已由二十餘家而减剩為十四家，其總共的資本亦僅在一百萬元左右，以致出產額方面亦逐年减低，平均每年僅產油二十四萬擔，油餅六十八萬擔。我看了上列的報吿後，劉君又同時出示過去數年的滬市榨油業產額表，互相的比較下來，顯然的上海的榨油事業，在近年亦已陷入了衰落的狀態。</p>
<p>該廠各部工塲，劉君所吿，全國榨油業出產的種類頗多，普通的有桐油，生油，荳油，萆蔴油，茶油，菜油等十餘種，比較上銷路最廣。但，該廠為了營業上的關係，目卞暫出品椰子油及棉子油二種。於是首先我們便去參觀椰子油工塲。</p>
<p>榨椰子油的工作，可分為四部：（一）原料整理：這部的工作，是先將運來的原料集在一處，經過了工人的檢騐及整理後，便置入烘爐問，在烘爐間中把椰子經了一度的烘焙後，就取出而轉輸施行第二部的工作製餅處。（二）製餅：當已經了烘培後的椰子，便成為了柔質的散末。所以必須將它製成了規定面積的油餅，始能置入榨壓機榨壓。此部的工人，卽將椰子製為長方型之油餅，其普通的面積，的為一百立方吋左右。（三）榨壓工作，製成後之油餅，便復置入烘爐間焙乾，待乾後，始置入榨壓機中。此種榨壓機，力量頗大，每架能同時榨壓製就之椰子餅十數方。（四）淸濾工作；當榨壓機將椰子餅榨壓後，其所榨出之油，便全部流入油糟。因油中尙含有雜份，所以在糟內另須經過一番淸濾的工作，將油中之雜質提出，始能成為純淸的椰子油。於是始由油管注入貯藏棧。在椰子經了榨壓後，剩餘之渣便成為極堅硬之油餅，此種油餅，除一部份直接包裝出口外，亦有以轉磨機打成粉末者。據吿，須以供需情形而定。</p>
<p>第二部參觀棉子榨油工廠。此部工塲共分二層，底層為棉子油的原料貯藏處。上層為棉子整理及榨壓工塲。榨棉子油的工作，程序上則較略麻煩。因棉子原料於運來時，尙夾雜棉花及共他雜份，所以於榨壓之先，必須經過淸除的工作，才能得到純粹的棉子。當工作開始時，先將棉子的原料，自底層的貯藏處，以運輸器一袋袋的升入上　的打棉機中，棉子經了打棉機的轉軌，所混雜看她棉花及雜份，就跟棉子分離。純粹的棉子，便分別的流入　　　中。這樣</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，再經過一番淸濾的工作，便完成為棉子油。</p>
<p>在榨壓的工作完畢後，另一步的手績，便為裝筒。當我退出了榨油工塲，便同劉君去參觀裝筒的情况。</p>
<p>立德油廠共有三個巨大的貯油棧，四周均裝有放油的籠頭，能自動開放，所以裝油的手續很簡單而便利。據劉君云：每日能裝數千筒。所裝筒之油，其重量因不能完全準確，故另需過鎊。又該廠因位沿蘇州河，故對於出口的筒油，都自備船隻運輸。</p>
<p>在參觀完舉，我戚到中國的榨油事業，如果能加以振興，使之加增生產效率，其前途確有極度發達的可能。因我國的對外貿易品上，植物油的輸出是頗佔着重要的地位。</p>
<h3>慈祥的老人</h3>
<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>——山行雜記之四</p>
<p>我們四個人騎着馬，瘋狂一般地在山路上奔馳着，不管老馬夫在我們的背後是如何地高呌着；將馬趕慢一點。雖則，我不善騎馬，幾决在下山坡的常兒，我幾乎要從馬鞍上滑下來，但我終於用着我的全力，克服了這危難。漸漸地我的膽量更六了，仿佛是一個貫熟的騎馬的能手，奸幾次將　　　的　伴的前面去；因此，馬就奔馳得更快。跟隨在我們後面步行如老馬夫，被我們仍在遼遠遼遠的後面，消失在峯的朝霧中了。</p>
<p>陽光漸漸地從東方的山峽躍上了高空，伸出了它火熱的巨手，急緊地捉住這條禿頭無陰的山路；却因此而蒸起了黃沙，瀰漫了去路。人流着汗，馬也喘息着。我們騎在馬鞍上，兩腿與屁股之問，彷彿火一般的烘着。馬這時怎麼也不提起它奔馳的脚步了。任何如何鞭打着，它毫沒有反抗；只張開着它的大口，不斷地換着氣，白沫從它的口中滾出來。汗沸水漫濕了它的身體。兩股之間的瘦骨，高高地聳起來，肚子癟下去，那種軟弱神氣，彷彿大病了一塲似的。這四匹瘦馬，它們是那樣地衰老呵！一個個都睜着一對血紅的含淚的眼睛，像是憤怒地在怔着我們，又彷彿在向我們求情！</p>
<p>猛的，我們四個人都被感動了，使我想起了那追在我們後面和馬一樣衰弱的老馬夫來了。他這時該不會像馬一樣地疲乏着提不起它那軟弱的脚步，而暈倒在那一個山谷中了。或者對着天哀吿着：『四位先生，該不是四個馬賊將我的馬騙去了吧？』</p>
<p>我們這樣地想着，便在路邊的一塊大　　　　　的　　上坐下麥了。要不是馬不肯拔步趕路，我們眞的要將馬趕　去迎接老馬夫才好！</p>
<p>路邊羣不着水喝，我們口渴得農乎要死。恰巧又是中午，陽光正烈。坐着的我們，都汗流夾背，想着那在毒辣的陽光低下追趕着我們老馬夫，都不禁發塞熱症的顫慄起來，一陣心酸湧上心頭。望着陽光漸漸地爬過了中空，路上還沒見着一個人影，我們的內心更是慌亂了。何况我們今天還要趕到前面的山脚下去投宿。</p>
<p>一直到太陽偏了西，老馬夫在遠處的路頭出現了。他急急地行着，搖晃着身體，彷彿像一雙負着次重的担子的駱駝似的，遠遠地可以看得出他的疲乏，他的內心是如何地焦急呵！</p>
<p>老人不知在什麽地方，拾着了一根樹校，當作手杖，一顚一顚地敲着地下，那模樣又令我們好笑。當他看見我們出現在路邊的時候。老人慌了，快樂的心緒不知緊到了如何的程度，趕忙地將手杖丟去了。一歪一歪地向我們的身邊跑來，不和我們交言，就畢直地走到四匹馬的身邊去，用手模它們的身體，用鼻子嗅它們的腦袋，用臉相他們面孔。……老人樂得幾乎近於瘋狂了，他嘴裏吚吚唔唔地說着，不知要怎樣來安慰他四匹辛苦的馬兒，老人簡直忘記自己的疲勞了。本來軟弱的馬兒，這時却一下子打起了精神，見着親人似的，對老馬夫搖頭擺尾了。</p>
<p>我們的心裏都突起了一個念頭，我們想老馬夫該要如何地在我們面前發洩他的氣憤了。我們靜靜鮑坐在一邊，等待着老人來責問我們的一切的錯處。</p>
<p>但是，誰也沒有想到，老人是那樣地和藹呵！他慈鮮地笑着，向我們的身邊走來，却像一個父親似的來安慰着我們：先生，你家們慮了，嘻嘻！』他笑着，不敢走近我們的身邊：『先生，對不起你家們，勞你家們的駕，等了我好久了，』他抬起頭來望望太陽：『唉！天色不早了，只怪我不好，嘻嘻，今天……』他不敢說下去，倒退了幾步，忍聲下氣地站在那兒，等待着我們的回話，我們都被他深深地打動了心絃，都說不出一句話來，這慈祥的老人呵！</p>
<p>待了一會老人又提着顫動的嗓子開了口：『先牛，你家們要不嫌棄的話，請到舍下去住一晚，我們家要又沒有多人，明天包你家們吃早飯的時候，就可以趕到山脚下啦！』</p>
<p>這夜，我們下宿在老馬夫家中的。</p>
<h3>短期小學</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>五年多的失業，在形容上，我已是個精神萎縮的傢伙了，在馬路上閒蕩着，我眞像是隻胆小的鼠兒，我閃避着路人注視，那些卑劣的眼光呵！使人見了生氣。</p>
<p>今天跑到一個朋友的學校里去，見朋友正在忙着，我就感到一陣的悲痛。唉：人家正在忙着，而我却空閑着呵！朋友呌我坐一會兒呀！」我只感到那句話着實是太諷刺了。</p>
<p>等到朋友工作完畢，遞給了我一支烟，問我：「近况如何？」我只悽然一笑：「還不是跟過去一樣，—失業嗎？」</p>
<p>朋友是非常高興我這個回答，他陡地從籐椅中跳了起來，捉着我的屑胛，，很快活似地對我說：「馬加！有個位置啦！你幹嗎？」</p>
<p>我像隻餓慌了的狗兒，一聞着牛肉的氣息，就把口涎水也掛出了嘴巴來，我忙回答朋友：「有個位置嗎？我為什麽不幹呢？」</p>
<p>於是朋友吿訴我，他們校里有個短期小學，正缺少一個老師，我旣然沒有職業，為什麽不擔任下來呢？每天上三點鐘踝，十六隻大洋一月。朋友說：「不過辛苦點吧了！然而在我，那正是個「肥缺」呢！辛苦？吃飯的事有不費力的嗎？（未完）</p>

<h3>生死同心　可怖的古廟</h3>
<p>殘廢的泥塑神像　伸長舌頭走起來</p>
<p>明星亞爾培路第二攝影塲最近彌漫着相當恐怖的氣味，應該說明這種所謂恐怖都建築在走入去者的心理作用上，那裏沒有什麼可以搆成恐怖的鬼魔妖精，可是走人去的人常常會偶然間駭怕甚至逃了出來，當裏面很少人的時候。現在開始從頭至尾來吿訴你這一回有趣味的故事吧！</p>
<p>應雲衛的「生死同心」在積極進行着，有一堂古廟的佈景是由名置景師馬瘦紅搭置了。古廟佔去了一大部攝影塲，破敗，凄凉，殘碎的破牆，久無人走的亂雜的院子，殘樹，砍去了頭的神像提了一把實劍守在門口：廟宇裏，十分高敞而十分空虛，巨神瞪着灰黑了的巨眼，塵網披了一體，凶獰地坐在高高的龕里；旁都是泥神，有的砍去了手，有的丟了頭，有的仍在灰塵裏要打人捉人的樣子，有的拖出了個尺來長的舌頭，伸着一隻又細又長的手要撲過來，牛頭馬面，黑白無常，雖已被灰塵和珠網所罩，那些猙獰的態度，還是一分不减。</p>
<p>佈景還沒有完成時，那些牛頭馬面，巨神怪像，零亂地在各處璧角黑暗處放着，要你不知道時走入去，東一看。瞪着眼的怪人在望着你，西一瞥，嚇，巨大的妖怪！不經意中常常要駭了一大跳！尤其在人不多時的沈靜時，而攝影塲的光綫又是非常幽嗜的。</p>
<p>有一次，攝影塲在拍那一邊的佈景，是歐陽予倩的「淸明時節」，黎明暉，趙丹之外，還有一位李麗蓮小姐在演戲，這邊正有一個小工在把一個拖長舌頭的怪鬼搬動着，——因為這是紙質所搆，所以很輕便可搬。而人却在背後看不見，李麗蓮偶然一看，赫然是那鬼在拖着舌子走路了，嚇得大呌起來，甚至流出了眼淚，看有人在搬，才鬆了一口氣拍了拍胸口。</p>
<p>這可怖的古廟在「生死同心」中，是一個奇怪的革命靑年的居宿之地。所謂奇怪的革命靑年是袁牧之所演的灼壞了臉的相當怕人的人物。</p>

<h3>Two Memorial Weeks in the Central Government, Central Committee Chairman Ye Chucang Also Reports, The National Government is Led by Chairman Lin to Give Lectures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held the 41st weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen at 9 am on the 14th. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Lin Sen, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Le Jingtao, Tian Kunshan, Xiao Zhongzhen, Mao Zuquan, Chen Fangxian, Jiang Zuobin, Jing Hengyi, Wang Yongbao, Hong Ludong, Wang Bingjun, Chu Minyi, Wang Shufang, Shao Hua, Deng Jiayan, Fang Zhi, Lai Lian, Chen Gongbo, Peng Xuepei, Gan Naiguang, Chen Shuren, Xiao Zheng, Chuan Bingchang, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Zhen, Lu Zhonglin, Zhou Fo Hai, Duan Xipeng, Li Zonghuang, Ma Chaojun, Wen Yiyou, Wu Jingxiong, and all staff members, totaling more than 700 people, attended. Chairman Ye Chucang led the entire group in paying respects and then reported. The meeting adjourned at 8:30 am. (Central News Agency telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week on the morning of the 14th. Sun Ke, Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lu Chao, Wei Huai and other officials of the National Government and various ministries, totaling more than 500 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the group in paying respects, he gave an impromptu speech on "Exercising the Right to Vote as the First Step for National Good Governance," stating that the convocation of the National Assembly is an important key to the transition from political tutelage to constitutionalism. Therefore, this conference is indeed an epoch-making initiative in the history of our country. However, the convocation of the National Assembly is conditional on the people exercising their right to vote. If the people do not have the right to vote, the conference cannot be convened. Even if the people have the right to vote but do not exercise it or exercise it improperly, it can also affect the value of the National Assembly. When exercising the right to vote, any improper behavior should not occur. Even abandoning the right to vote should be avoided, because this is precisely our own judgment to be responsible to the country. The country can obtain sound development from this, and individuals can also obtain many conveniences. Anyone who abandons the right to vote is tantamount to voluntarily severing the relationship with the country. In short, in this decisive election, everyone must be based on the sense of responsibility of the country and the individual, and earnestly take responsibility to elect their own trusted representatives. This is the first step for us to participate in politics, and it is also the road for our country to move towards long-term stability and security. I hope everyone will pay attention to it.

<p>(Nanjing) Committee member Ye Chucang of the Central Committee reported on the morning of the 14th that the Guangxi Pacification Director, Comrade Li, and Provincial Chairman, Comrade Huang, telegraphed the central government to schedule their inauguration. Standing Committee member of the Military Affairs Commission, Comrade Bai, will go to Guangdong to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the coming days. This difficult problem has now been satisfactorily resolved. In the middle of the satisfactory resolution, there have been ups and downs. Recently, comrades from Guangdong came to Beijing and said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's spirit of tolerance in the past month is worthy of our admiration. There were several times when it was almost unbearable. Many comrades did not want Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to tolerate it any longer, but Chairman Chiang Kai-shek always gritted his teeth and tolerated what others could not tolerate, and endured what others could not endure. With this great power, he finally resolved this difficult problem. It can be seen that tolerance is the foundation of success. However, so-called tolerance is not tolerance without purpose, nor is it tolerance without limit. It is within the maximum limit and has the most far-reaching purpose. This kind of tolerance is the foundation of success. Not only is tolerance of internal affairs the foundation of success, but tolerance of external affairs is also the foundation of success. However, tolerance of external affairs must also have a purpose and a limit. Mencius said,</p>

<p>"When heaven is about to entrust a great task to someone, it must first afflict his mind, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body, empty his resources, and disrupt his actions, so as to stir his heart, temper his nature, and increase what he is incapable of." Stirring his heart, tempering his nature, and increasing what he is incapable of is the foundation of tolerance, that is, having a purpose and a limit. If there is no limit and no purpose, then it will not be possible to increase what he is incapable of. The greatest purpose of external affairs is to increase what he is incapable of. What China does not have, make it have; what is lacking, increase it. Without stirring the heart and tempering the nature, it is impossible to increase what he is incapable of. If we do not work hard on tolerance in everything, we will inevitably run on the road of arrogance and restlessness. On the one hand, we will not be able to increase what we are incapable of. Therefore, what we need will not be increased, and we will eventually fail. On every National Humiliation Memorial Day, those who do not fully understand the principles of establishing a country and revitalizing a country always think that it is time for generosity and passion, and that there must be a kind of generosity and passion. He must not have seen more important things ahead. Therefore, he has this concept. If we can reflect on ourselves at this time, how much have we tolerated, and how much has the country increased? If we do not forget these two words, it will be more beneficial to the country. This is the feeling gained from the resolution of the Guangxi issue. If all comrades can use the method of tolerance to seek to increase what they are incapable of to lead, and prevent the purposeless and limitless generosity and passion, and emulate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's example of handling the Guangxi affair, and forge a spirit of tolerance from the boredom, and forge a kind of power from the tolerance, this may not be a point in the way of establishing a country.

<h3>The Current Situation in Beihai is Still Calm, Ling Shifen is Unable to Conduct an Investigation, Japanese Warships Did Not Enter the Port After Persuasion, Weng Zhaoyuan's Troops are Not Prepared to Withdraw, Kawagoe will Request Guarantees of Safety and Convenience for Japanese Investigators</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diao Zuoqian has sent Secretary Ling to investigate the Beihai incident. Diao sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report on the 14th. The investigation has not yet been completed, and there is no specific report yet. As for the situation in Beihai, relevant parties received a telegram yesterday saying that it is still calm. (Special telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) News of a peaceful resolution in Guizhou reached Beihai on the 11th, and people here are greatly relieved. However, Weng Zhaoyuan's troops are currently not prepared to withdraw and are recruiting soldiers on a large scale. (Special telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Diao Zuoqian said on the 14th that Ling Shifen arrived in Beihai on the 12th aboard the Fu'an warship. During the investigation of the Nakano incident, he met the Japanese Sagami warship outside the port and politely persuaded them not to send investigators to land. After they accepted it, they telegraphed the Japanese consulate in Guangdong for instructions. The Japanese consulate also telegraphed the warship to temporarily not enter the port. Ling remained in Beihai to continue investigating the truth of the case, which is still unclear. Reports that this office admitted that Nakano died because the people held a meeting are absolutely not true. This is a local incident and should not be expanded. (Special telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 14th, a large number of foreign visitors went to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the possible developments regarding the Beihai incident. According to a spokesperson for the province, the Japanese investigators originally agreed to meet the Chinese investigators a certain distance outside the port of Beihai and then travel to Beihai together on a Chinese gunboat to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. However, unfortunately, the 19th Route Army refused to allow the Japanese investigators to land. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed Ambassador Kawagoe last night to continue to request the National Government to provide guarantees of safety and convenience for the Japanese investigators. The spokesperson believes that the investigation will eventually proceed peacefully, and it is only a matter of time. (Central News Agency telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Ling Shifen, the investigator of the Nakano Junzo case, arrived in Beihai on the 12th and was refused when he tried to land for investigation. After negotiations with the local garrison, he was allowed to land, but he was unable to carry out the investigation work. Ling then returned to the Fu'an warship and sailed out of the port, where he encountered the Japanese warship Sagami, which was sailing from Guangdong to Beihai. Ling told the Japanese about the real situation in the area and advised the Japanese investigators not to enter the port for the time being to avoid further incidents. The Japanese officer on the warship telegraphed the consulate in Guangdong for instructions and then received a reply to temporarily stay in the port to await orders. Ling also telegraphed for instructions on his actions. Diao Zuoqian instructed him to temporarily anchor outside the port of Beihai and wait for instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Central News Agency telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The rumor that the Chinese and Japanese personnel sent to Beihai to investigate the Nakano murder incident could not conduct the investigation due to the opposition of the 19th Route Army was confirmed by Diao Minqian, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, today. According to Diao, his secretary had arrived in Beihai, but left the area because he could not perform his duties. The secretary later boarded the Japanese gunboat Sagami at Haikou, the main port of Hainan Island, and notified the Japanese investigators of the attitude of the 19th Route Army, urging the Japanese warships not to enter Beihai, saying that this might cause a conflict. The Japanese personnel have agreed to stay in Haikou for the time being to await developments. It is also reported that the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou visited Diao today to discuss the investigation issue. (Reuters telegram on the 14th)</p>

<h3>Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate, Regulations Submitted to Nanjing for Review, Guo Zhihan and Deng Zhexi Arrive in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Guo Zhihan, Director of the Finance Department of the Hebei-Chahar Council, came to Tianjin at 12 pm on the 14th to visit Song and brought the regulations of the Hebei-Chahar Chief Inspectorate to Song for review. The regulations were discussed and decided by Qin Dechun, Deng Zhexi, Ge Dingyuan, Sun Weidong, and others in Ping. When Li Qingxuan, a specialist from the Ministry of Finance, and Bailicha, head of the anti-smuggling section of the Shanghai General Tax Office, arrive in Tianjin on the 15th, they will study whether there are any flaws and then issue them. The tax rate is raised to a maximum of 60% of the regular customs tax and a minimum of 15%, based on the principle of charging fees according to the amount of sales. The tax rate at the Qikou branch is higher than at ordinary branches to prevent excessive smuggling by sea, which disrupts customs anti-smuggling. The person in charge of the Inspectorate said that most of the smuggled goods arriving in Tianjin by land have already paid the puppet customs tax in eastern Hebei. The Tianjin Inspectorate charges a verification fee to balance prices. If goods arriving by sea from Qikou are taxed according to common practice, the goods have not paid the puppet tax in eastern Hebei, and the selling price will be lower, which will affect the general anti-smuggling work. Therefore, a higher verification fee must be specially charged to balance the price. (Special telegram on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Deng Zhexi, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Legal Committee, and Zhang Jiyong, Director of the Hebei Civil Affairs Department, were summoned to Tianjin this morning to participate in consultations. Guo Zhihan also went to Tianjin in the same car. (Special telegram on the 14th)</p>

<h3>The Anti-Soviet Congress in Nuremberg</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The annual congress of the German National Socialist Party has been underway in Nuremberg since it opened on the 9th. It has been several days now. During these days of the congress, in addition to demonstrating its strong military power, the leaders of the National Socialist Party have continuously delivered fierce speeches denouncing the Soviet Union. Therefore, this congress of the National Socialist Party can be said to be an anti-Soviet congress.</p>
<p>From the perspective of international diplomatic etiquette, no matter how serious the conflict between the two countries is in reality, the language publicly expressed by their responsible personnel is always very polite. The public denunciation of the Soviet Union by the leaders of the National Socialist Party at this Nuremberg congress is a rare fact. But from these face-turning denunciations, we can also see the rise of the anti-Soviet movement and the seriousness of the German-Soviet conflict.</p>
<p>Germany's eastward policy is one of the important foreign policies of the National Socialist Party. The main target of this eastward foreign policy is the socialist Soviet Union. In the past few years, Germany has actively carried out the anti-Soviet movement not only in words but also in reality. Why is Germany so enthusiastic about the anti-Soviet movement? There are many reasons for this. First, in terms of the doctrines believed by the two countries, Bolshevism and National Socialism are completely incompatible. Didn't the German Minister of Propaganda say at the congress, "Bolshevism is the behavior of crazy criminals"? Secondly, the plains of western Ukraine in the Soviet Union are</p>
<p>A piece of fertile land that Germany has always wanted to get its hands on. Rosenberg, director of the Foreign Affairs Group of the German National Socialist Party, said in his book "The Basic Structure of National Socialism" long ago, "Giving the German people freedom in the East (referring to the Soviet Union) is the entire foundation of our country's restoration." Even at this congress, Hitler said, "If Germany has the wheat-producing areas of Ukraine and Siberia, it will be leisurely and without struggle to survive." Therefore, Germany's enthusiasm for the anti-Soviet movement and the active promotion of the eastward policy is to eliminate the socialist country and seize the fertile land of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The above is from the fundamental reason of Germany's anti-Soviet policy. As for the leaders of the National Socialist Party using the words of village women scolding the streets to denounce the Soviet Union at this Nuremberg congress, it has other internal and external functions. As for the internal function, the National Socialist Party has been in power for nearly four years, but it has not solved the domestic economic problems at all. Therefore, it has aroused great dissatisfaction among the people. Therefore, in order to divert the people's attention, the National Socialist Party had to strengthen the anti-Soviet movement, saying that the reason why the Germans cannot "be leisurely" is because they have not won Ukraine. As for the external aspect, Germany's recent announcement of extending the period of compulsory military service and actively expanding its armaments has aroused a strong reaction from countries such as Britain and France. Therefore, Hitler strengthened the anti-Soviet movement, on the one hand, to win the sympathy of capitalist countries, and on the other hand, to divert their attention from focusing on military preparations. The reason why the Nuremberg Congress of the National Socialist Party has become an anti-Soviet congress is due to this reason.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union will naturally not remain silent about this attack and denunciation by the National Socialist Party. The Mingjue Ke Red Army's Grand Exercises can be said to be the Soviet Union's counterattack against the anti-Soviet Congress in Nuremberg. Soviet Defense People's Commissar Voroshilov said to the troops participating in this Grand Exercises, "The invincible Red Army is ready to annihilate the enemy at any time within its own territory," which is a clear warning to the National Socialist Party's eastward policy. From the nature of this Nuremberg Congress, we can know that the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is becoming more and more tense, and the opposition between the aggressive group and the peace group is becoming more and more acute.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Designates Landing Station for China Aviation Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong government has designated Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon as the landing station for China Aviation aircraft. The post office will also directly receive and send airmail from mainland China. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Here, upon receiving the news that the Hong Kong government has agreed to allow the aircraft of the China Aviation Corporation to land in Hong Kong, great welcome has been shown. From this it can be seen that the exchange conditions that the British government previously insisted on, that China must allow British aircraft to have the right to land in Chinese territory before allowing Chinese commercial aircraft to land in Hong Kong, have now been canceled. The Hong Kong government has also decided to allow Pan American Airlines to use that location as the end point in Asia for its trans-Pacific route. People here have also expressed considerable joy upon hearing this. However, Pan American Airlines once considered using Macau as its endpoint because the British government refused to allow Sino-American aircraft to land in Hong Kong. Pan American Airlines has an investment relationship with China Aviation Corporation, so it is generally expected that China Aviation Corporation may form an aviation network from Hong Kong to various parts of China. In addition, it is heard that Pan American Airlines has also entered into an agreement with British Imperial Airways, allowing the passengers of the two companies to interchange planes. It is also heard that Pan American Airlines has entered into a contract with the Hong Kong government regarding mail from the United States. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Declaration: Willing to Join Hands with All Countries; Never Allow Communism to Rise Again, and Cites the Spanish Incident as a Warning</h3>
<p>Nuremberg: Chancellor Hitler today addressed more than 100,000 stormtroopers and blackshirts, making a solemn statement regarding Germany's desire for peace, saying, "We only have one wish, which is to maintain peace. We already know what war is, so we are very willing to join hands with the people of all countries around us and work together. We have no hostility towards them, but one thing must be made clear, that Germany will never be inclined to Bolshevism. We will never allow the results of our work and the careers created by the hard work of millions of people to be destroyed by some international and Bolshevik Jews. Now, in other countries, the public is often instigated to convene anti-fascist and national socialist rallies, and to support Bolsheviks, and advocate providing them with weapons, money, manpower, etc. I have never convened any similar rallies in my life, but if there is an opportunity to convene one, the number of participants will definitely be more than 10,000 to 30,000, but will have millions of people. In addition, there will be millions more people who raise their hands in favor of resisting our old enemies, the parasites of humanitarianism."</p>
<p>Hitler then had an informal conversation with Reuters reporters during lunch, first explaining the reasons why this year's National Socialist Party Congress focused on attacking Bolshevism. The lunch was held in a 700-year-old castle, which was ideally located with a view over the ancient city of Nuremberg. Those present at the lunch included Hitler's confidant Hess, the newly appointed German Ambassador to the UK Ribbentrop, and many foreign reporters. Hitler was still wearing the ordinary brown clothes he had worn during the morning parade, and was in good spirits. When shaking hands with people, he was heavy and enthusiastic. When discussing his speech to the stormtroopers, Hitler also mentioned the anti-fascist demonstrations that had occurred in various countries, saying that at present, other countries are tolerating demonstrations advocating aid to the Spanish Bolsheviks, and openly raising money and weapons for them, but view the Nuremberg Congress as a mobilization of the National Socialist Party. Hitler showed a contemptuous smile when speaking, and also said, "If we followed our usual intentions and instructed the national population to initiate support for the Spanish Nationalist Party, with just one order from me, 10 to 15 million German people would respond. The greatness of this kind of demonstration would be unprecedented in the world, and would definitely make the whole world, even Moscow, feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>According to Hitler's estimate, the strength of his political force, excluding the army, includes 2 million stormtroopers, 267,000 blackshirts, and 22,000 other teams. Hitler continued, "The world seems to find it strange that we are so strongly opposed to Bolshevism. In fact, it is because we and Italy have experienced the same situation as today's Spain. For example, in Nuremberg in 1923, (Hitler pointed to the chimneys in the distance) 4,500 veterans marched through here and were attacked by communists. Also, in Munich, during the Soviet regime, many pledged people were shot by Bolsheviks, which is no different from today's Spain. Today's Germany is no longer afraid of the invasion of Bolshevism. What is worrying is that the countries around Germany are now being contaminated by this Bolshevik poison, and will each suffer from it. We cannot stand idly by in this situation. It should be known that we are one of the countries in Europe, and we have related relationships with our neighboring countries in terms of culture and commerce. I dare to believe that we 'wild National Socialists' are ultimately the best people in Europe." (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Socialist Party Congress Closes; Military Parade Held; 400 Airplanes Participate</h3>
<p>Nuremberg: Today is the closing day of the 8th annual congress of the National Socialist Party. As in previous years, a military parade was held. 400 airplanes, cavalry, artillery, and motorized infantry regiments, carrying new weapons, practiced fighting. There were as many as 100,000 people in the audience, all applauding thunderously and shouting "Victory" slogans. Their emotions were excited, as if drunk, especially when airplanes appeared and bombs exploded. The parade is briefly described below. Initially, the various troops practiced, and then they formed a square formation and stood still. Then, a large number of students from the Dobrits Aviation School, holding various flags, entered the field one after another. In addition to the faded Prussian flag of 1813 and the flag of the German Empire, there were also many new military flags of the army, navy, and air force, which were personally awarded by Chancellor Hitler to the newly formed troops. Among them, the infantry flag was black and white, with an iron cross in the center and a small swastika in each of the four corners. The navy flag was blue and white, and the air force flag was red, white, and orange. This afternoon, a military parade will be held again, and then Chancellor Hitler will deliver a speech to conclude the congress. (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>English, French and Czech Representatives Highly Praise the Red Army's Strength, Especially its Air Force and Tank Corps</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The French, Czech, and British military delegations, after observing maneuvers in the Belorussian Military District, have arrived in Moscow and shared their impressions with local journalists as follows:</p>
<p>General Rucha, the Chief Czech Representative, stated, "By deciding to participate in the exercises, the combat effectiveness and training of the various units can be described as exceptionally good. All units have demonstrated extremely strong dynamism. I believe special attention should be paid to the Red Army's infantry and the tactical training of the tank battalions. Your country has adopted new tactics by deploying such a large number of tanks, and the Red Army has been able to solve this complex problem in a short period of time. In this regard, your country is pioneering a new path in military thinking. The commanding officers have demonstrated a high level of tactical and technical training, extreme endurance, noble spirit, and loyalty to the motherland. They are able to quickly solve the most complex problems of modern warfare. The Red Army possesses the latest technology. In my view, it is the most advanced army in the world in this respect. The airborne troops descending from aircraft demonstrated the high level of fighting spirit and courage. Currently, we can say that only the Red Army can deploy troops on a large scale from aircraft. We have seen many meaningful events, which we will try to utilize in our army."</p>
<p>General Chivesgerte and General Flemming, Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the French Army, stated, "We have been greatly impressed by the steadfastness and bravery of the infantry and other units during their movements, as well as the courage of the paratroopers. The tank movements demonstrated the drivers' refined skills. We would like to pay special attention to the extremely good condition of the artillery and the horses used by the cavalry." Mr. Flemming continued, "We admire the orderly formations of the air force and pay particular attention to the fighter planes and high-speed bombers, as well as the skill of their pilots." In conclusion, Mr. Chives spoke of the interest aroused in the French delegation by the nearly completed Minsk Red Army barracks and its sports and cultural facilities.</p>
<p>General Wavell, the leader of the British delegation, stated, "I am familiar with the old Russian army, so I paid special attention to your progress. We admire the soundness of your army and its endurance. The training level of the commanding officers made an excellent impression. We were deeply impressed by the technical development of your infantry, tanks, and aircraft. You have undoubtedly achieved great success in this area. The control of fighter planes during the exercises proved the high level of technical knowledge and skills of the combatants. The paratroopers also demonstrated amazing bravery, fortitude, and good training." Colonel Martel, a well-known British Staff representative and author on tank problems, stated, "I must admit that the tank drivers I saw were excellent. During the entire exercise, only a very small number of tanks were forced to stop on the battlefield due to mechanical or material failures. There were no accidental landings or damage to the aircraft. This fact convinces people of the excellence of your aircraft and tanks and proves the high skill of the tank and air personnel. As for the spectacle of airborne troop deployment, we are seeing it for the first time. The good order during the landings confirms the bravery and high spirit of the paratroopers."

<h3>National Socialist Party Congress: Hitler's Closing Address - Will He Announce a Break in Relations with Russia?</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler will deliver an important official speech in Nuremberg tonight. There is much speculation among outsiders about this speech. Some predict that Mr. Hitler will announce the severance of diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, because cooperation with countries whose principles are fundamentally opposed to National Socialism cannot be beneficial to Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Petit Journal recently reported that as the German National Socialist Party Congress is about to close, the head of state, Hitler, will deliver a final speech tomorrow afternoon, stating that communism will not be tolerated if it interferes with the borders of Germany. "If this statement is interpreted in a milder diplomatic tone, it means that if a communist revolution occurs in France, the new German armed forces will immediately intervene by force," it is said. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Tense Relations Between Germany and Russia Cause Anxiety Among British Political Figures</h3>
<p>(London) The recent tense relations between Germany and Russia have caused considerable anxiety among political figures here. They fear that the impact will jeopardize the future of the Locarno Conference. It is said that the German National Socialist Party Congress's launch of an "anti-Bolshevik crusade" is intended to win the favor of the British people. However, the result is that, apart from the extreme right wing of the Conservative Party, such as Lord Rothermere, and former Colonial Secretary Amery, the other factions have not expressed sympathy. The reason for this is that Germany's movement is too hasty, like a volcanic eruption, and therefore fails to gain people's trust. Officials in Britain are concerned about the international repercussions that may arise. They believe that the most unpredictable aspect of Europe is not Russia, but Germany. Britain should do everything in its power to resolve difficulties and ease the hostile relations between these countries. However, unless the Rhine River problem is resolved simultaneously with general European issues, France will be difficult to satisfy. Even if a new Locarno Pact is concluded, it will be in vain if the dangerous areas of Eastern Europe are ignored. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the future Locarno Conference, the British government previously notified Italy and Germany of its intention to convene a meeting in late October. According to the Morning Post's correspondent in London, Prince Bismarck, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, visited Sir Westcott, an official of the British Foreign Office, yesterday. He inquired under what conditions the countries involved would resume talks with Germany after the Five-Power Conference, i.e., the Locarno Conference, ended. He stated that if the Soviet Union were allowed to participate in these talks, as rumored, the German government would stay away. Furthermore, thorough diplomatic preparations must be made before the start of the Five-Power Conference, and the plan to hold it in October would be too rushed. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently commented on the proceedings of the German National Socialist Party Congress, stating that the German Foreign Ministry did not seem to have any official representatives participating. This raises a question among foreign observers as to how much responsibility the Ministry can still bear for its diplomatic duties. "If the German authorities believe that Britain will assist Germany in eradicating communism so that fascism can dominate Europe, they are misunderstanding the nature of the British people. It is undoubtedly the case that the speeches delivered by the German leaders in Nuremberg were planned in advance, and their intention was to oppose the Franco-Russian alliance treaty (i.e., the mutual assistance pact). However, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to expect the neighboring countries of Germany that have already concluded such treaties to abandon them. In fact, if a general solution to the European problem can be found, so that all alliance treaties concluded by various countries lose their purpose, then it would not only be possible but also desirable. However, this can only be achieved after the causes that led to these alliance treaties have been completely eliminated. In short, both France and Russia are now vigilant and determined to help each other, which is only reasonable," it is said. The Daily Chronicle stated, "Germany is now prepared to bargain over the conclusion of a Western European security agreement. If France is unable to participate in this smaller-scope agreement due to the obligations stipulated in the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact, then Germany wants to conclude a pact with Britain to counter the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact."

<h3>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity - Students Studying in Britain Arrive in London - Warm Welcome from Concerned Parties</h3>
<p>(London) Nineteen Chinese students selected by the British Boxer Indemnity Committee arrived in London today. Miss Li from the University of Hong Kong is also among them. Mr. Silcock, a director of the London China Association, representing the Chinese Committee of various universities, welcomed them at Plymouth and came to London on the same ship.

Several parties in London are preparing to hold a banquet to welcome them, including Mrs. Panli Tuobuluni, wife of the British Consul in Nanjing. As for the banquet of the Chinese Committee of various universities, it has been postponed due to the fact that most of the committee members have not returned to London. All new students will have comfortable residences, and the older students in London will do their best to take care of them. According to Mr. Silcock, who spoke to a Reuters reporter, all the new students are excellent.

<p>The Chilean Ambassador to Madrid, Mr. Moregado, now the leader of the diplomatic corps, set out for Toledo today to do his best to rescue the rebel women and children currently trapped in the historically famous Moorish castle of Alcazar in Spain. Spanish Prime Minister Caballerro has promised to provide all kinds of facilities. If the Alcazar women and children decide to leave the country, all embassies in the capital will provide them with refuge.

Mr. Mugado, the Chilean Ambassador to Spain, and Mr. Ilfin, the commercial counselor of Romania, personally went to the front line to contact the government authorities on ways to rescue the women and children in the fortress and send them to monasteries near Madrid. Spanish Prime Minister Caballerro also personally went to Toledo to participate in the negotiations and immediately accepted the recommendations of the diplomatic corps. Government soldiers then took a loudspeaker to a point ten yards away from the fortress and loudly announced to the rebel leader that the Chilean Ambassador was willing to talk to them. If they agreed, they were asked to raise a white flag as a sign of truce. After shouting five times, there was no response. The rebels immediately opened fire in response. The government forces, seeing that the rebels were unwilling to raise a white flag, continued to bomb the fortress. Mr. Mu announced tonight that he plans to continue appealing to the rebel leader tomorrow. (Guomin dispatch, 13th)</p>

Their purpose is to deal with the Catholic Church, because the Catholic Church is the only true obstacle to the exercise of destructive forces. This can be seen in countries such as Soviet Russia and Mexico. We must grieve for the violence of this fratricide, for the crimes against the Christian life and dignity, and for the destruction of the most sacred and precious traditions of a noble nation. The events in Spain have now reached the point where the foundations of all culture and civilization will be shaken. Those who destroy humanity are now seeking a common ground with Catholics. Their cunning schemes are extremely dangerous, and their aim is only to obscure the eyes and ears of the world. The Pope concluded by saying that he wished to pray that those who persecute the Church in Spain today will be reunited with the Church when peace is restored. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Vatican City Since the outbreak of civil strife in Spain, five hundred monks and ordinary people from that country have fled to Italy. They visited Pope Pius XI today. The Pope gave a speech to them, vehemently attacking communism, denouncing it as "devilish propaganda, the purpose of which is to conquer the whole world, so that it will be dominated by barren and harmful ideas. The party members of this evil force are trying in every way to get closer to Catholics, so as to cooperate with them, and thus facilitate the deception of Europe and the world, making them negligent in their defenses, and then taking the opportunity to achieve their private desires of hatred, rebellion, and destruction." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Observers here today believe that the Spanish Civil War will likely drag on until Christmas before a final victory can be determined. Conservatives estimate that 95,000 Spaniards have died in the civil strife so far, with an equal number wounded. There are still 20,000 prisoners in confinement, and property losses amount to approximately 10 billion Spanish pesetas. (Guomin dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Assassination Attempt on the British King – Masterminded by a Foreign Power – Perpetrator Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</h3>
<p>(London) The would-be assassin of the British King, McMahon, today made a shocking confession at the Old Bailey, stating that his attempt on the King's life was motivated by a foreign power that paid him for the task. He has now been sentenced to one year's imprisonment with hard labor. The courtroom was extremely crowded today for the hearing. The charges against McMahon totaled three: (1) Unlawfully possessing a weapon and attempting to endanger life; (2) Drawing a pistol while near the King, attempting to disturb the peace; (3) Unlawfully displaying a firearm with the intent to alarm the King. The most noteworthy event during today’s hearing was when McMahon stood to defend himself, admitting that in October 1935, he had been contacted by a certain foreign power and tasked with espionage. He further claimed that this foreign power provided him with money and the file number of documents he received, giving them to the War Office. This foreign representative attempted to incite him to rebel against the British government. A plan was then agreed upon to take advantage of the King's attendance at the Trooping the Colour ceremony in Hyde Park on July 16th and shoot him, for which he would be paid £150. It was also arranged to assign nine others to accompany him and assist in his escape. McMahon claimed to have reported this conspiracy to the War Office. McMahon also learned that if this conspiracy failed, they planned to attempt another assassination when the King visited France. When the case began, Attorney General Sir Thomas Inskip argued that the charges against the defendant were firmly established based on the previous evidence, and that there was no need to investigate the defendant's psychology regarding the third charge, or whether the King was alarmed. Mrs. Yaoman, residing in Leedon Street, testified in court that she had heard McMahon talking to a police officer by the roadside. As soon as their conversation ended, the royal procession from Hyde Park appeared. Mrs. Yaoman said, "I saw the King pause slightly to acknowledge the salute and look in the direction where McMahon was. I glanced back and saw McMahon raise his arm, and then I saw something fly from his hand and strike the King's horse." Upon questioning by the judge, Mrs. Yaoman agreed that it would not have been difficult for McMahon to fire a gun. She confirmed that McMahon had leaned over to throw the pistol. Special Constable Dix testified in court that he saw McMahon raise the gun to fire and immediately rushed forward, striking his hand and grabbing him, but did not see anything thrown from McMahon's hand. Constable Mabey testified, "At the time, I happened to be looking to the left when I saw McMahon rush towards the King. I went forward and seized him with both hands. I clearly saw a bright, shiny object fall beneath the feet of the King's horse." Firearms expert Churchill testified that McMahon's gun could easily fire five bullets in two seconds but could not confirm whether the gun had been used. McMahon's confession that he was paid by a foreign power to assassinate the King shocked everyone in the courtroom. When explaining why he carried the pistol, McMahon spoke in a low voice, stating that he knew his actions were extremely dangerous and felt uneasy, as he was both receiving money from a foreign power and reporting this information to the British government, which would inevitably lead to trouble. McMahon also wrote the names of the foreign embassy officials who had introduced him and those who had paid him to assassinate the King on a piece of paper, which he presented to the judge and prosecutor. McMahon added that the witnesses' statements were all accurate. He did not want to fire the gun at the time and so threw the pistol to the ground. The purpose of assassinating the King was to cause the disintegration of the British Empire, so that other countries could acquire its parts. When the prosecutor cross-examined McMahon, the defendant appeared extremely flustered and said, "I do not seek a pardon. I am merely revealing the whole truth and am willing to go to prison and suffer severe punishment, as only in prison can I escape the clutches of those I have deceived." The prosecutor questioned why McMahon had not revealed in the initial hearing that the letter to Home Secretary Simon had been instigated by a foreign spy. McMahon replied that his intention was to lure out all those involved in this conspiracy and that two foreign spies were eavesdropping in court when he testified in the police court. The prosecutor believed that McMahon's conspiracy was entirely a figment of his imagination. Upon hearing this, McMahon replied that only God knew the truth. McMahon's defense lawyer stated that although McMahon's confession was somewhat fanciful, it was not necessarily untrue. The Attorney General finally stated that McMahon's confession today was completely different from what he had said before in the police court. How could someone who disregarded oaths be trusted? Therefore, his words were unbelievable. The authorities have investigated McMahon's allegations of a conspiracy against the King, and the result has been to discover that his statements are completely unfounded. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) King Edward VIII, having departed from Dübendorf Airport in Switzerland aboard a royal aircraft, is hurrying back to the country, scheduled to arrive today. He is scheduled to proceed to Balmoral Castle in Scotland on the 19th of this month for hunting. There is a forest there that the King has rented for three weeks for the purpose of hunting. Furthermore, the White Star Line plans to build a large passenger ship of 81,000 tons, a sister ship to the "Queen Mary," and the keel will be laid soon. His Majesty will also visit to inspect the ship at that time. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Opium Inflows into North China: 35 Tons Last Year - Morphine Readily Available in Concessions</h3>
<p>(Correspondence from Bangor, North Wales) Professor Lester of the Lester Institute in Shanghai, speaking at a luncheon of the Rotary Club in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, stated that last year, the amount of opium that passed through North China totaled 35 tons. How many Chinese are addicted to opium? Who can know? But what he does know is that opium and narcotics are currently being imported into North China by the Japanese and sold privately. The morphine trade is also alarming. Those in the medical profession who wish to purchase morphine must comply with strict regulations, but if purchased through illegal channels, anyone can buy pounds of morphine from shops run by Chinese in the public concessions.

<p>Improvement in Sino-American Trade</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Department of Commerce announced today that both imports and exports between China and the United States showed improvement in July. Exports to China totaled $4,845,000, compared to $2,251,000 during the same period last year. Imports from China totaled $6,672,000, compared to $6,261,000 during the same period last year. (National Telegram, 13th) The Standing Legal and Political Conference of the Little Entente in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, continued its meeting this morning. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued, stating, "Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania have decided to unite all their forces to strengthen the security system." The policies to be pursued by the Little Entente are divided into four areas: (1) To work together and maintain solidarity, and to operate within the framework of the League of Nations despite the difficulties it has faced. Regional agreements are recognized as important elements of the peace situation. (2) The collective security system is not only applicable to Western Europe. (3) The Little Entente will maintain the most friendly relations with its neighboring countries. (4) The Little Entente will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor shall other countries interfere in the internal affairs of the Little Entente. The next meeting will be held in Geneva during the League of Nations conference. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, opened today and will conclude tomorrow evening, after which a communiqué will be issued. However, the Little Entente will reiterate the resolutions passed at the Standing Political Conference in May of this year (held in the Yugoslav capital) and the Heads of State Conference in June (held in the Romanian capital), especially the principle that negotiations on international treaties must be handled jointly by the Entente. At this moment, what is particularly emphasized by political figures is the agreement recently reached between Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović and Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu, stipulating that Romania should sell part of its oil production to Yugoslavia to be used for the latter's national defense plans. Those in charge say that the three Little Entente countries all want to strengthen the power of the League of Nations covenant and expand the content of regional security pacts. The appropriate measures to be taken in the event of violations of international treaties have also been carefully considered. In addition, Czech Prime Minister Hodža recently held talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović and Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu outside the conference, discussing economic issues in the Danube region.

<h3>French Prime Minister's Mediation of Labor Dispute Ineffective - Government Forces Mediation - Both Labor and Management Must Comply Within 24 Hours</h3>
<p>(Paris) 40,000 textile workers in Lille announced a strike. Minister of the Interior Salengro arbitrated, but his terms were not accepted by the employers. Therefore, Mr. Salengro requested Prime Minister Blum to mediate. Although Mr. Blum tried to mediate after arriving there, he was not effective. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the labor dispute in Lille, after Prime Minister Léon Blum's mediation failed, the Ministry of Interior issued a surprising communiqué stating that employers should accept the arbitration method set by government officials within 24 hours, and striking workers should also resume work at the same time. Both labor and management must quickly reach a compromise, which would be a blessing for the country. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Prime Minister Léon Blum personally went to Lille to mediate the labor dispute, the official newspaper "Le Populaire" of the orthodox Socialist Party commented that it was unprecedented in the country's history for the Prime Minister to personally leave the capital to act as an arbitrator. "The Prime Minister learned that the employer delegation had rejected mediation in Lille yesterday, and immediately exerted the government's will and decided to resolve the labor unrest through arbitration by government officials. The spokesperson for the employer delegation was well aware of this, as it was mentioned." The right-wing newspaper "Le Jour" stated, "The government's forced arbitration is no different from an ultimatum. In fact, this kind of approach should logically be directed at the striking workers occupying the factories, but now it is applied to the employers whose factories have been seized. There is nothing more extraordinary than this." (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3>Expansion of the Tianjin Japanese Consulate General: Eight Departments to Operate Starting Next Month - Plan to Increase Budget and Expand Police Powers</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The newly appointed Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Kaneki Horiuchi, will have been in office for almost a week. The expansion of the Tianjin Consulate General, making it the central organization for diplomacy and economics among the Japanese consulates in North China, and the expansion of the police department and increasing the number of police officers, etc., has begun to be prepared based on instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Horiuchi was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 14th to meet Ambassador Kawagoe to request instructions regarding the implementation of this matter. However, because Kawagoe went to Beijing to negotiate on diplomatic matters, it has been postponed until Kawagoe returns to Shanghai next week. Regarding the expansion of the consulate general's organization, it has been decided to implement it in early October. In addition to Consul General Horiuchi, several new or changed personnel will be added to the consulate staff, making it a special organization for North China. Second Secretary Ogihara of the Shanghai Embassy has also been transferred to serve as the Tianjin Consul and will take office in early next month. Taniguchi, the current Vice Consul of the Tianjin Consulate, has been transferred to serve as the Vice Consul of Harbin. His vacancy will be filled by Vice Consul Tanaka, who is stationed in Nanjing, and he will also take office next month. The consulate general will be divided into eight departments: (1) General Affairs, (2) Foreign Affairs, (3) Investigation, (4) Economy, (5) Commerce, (6) Police Affairs, (7) Justice, (8) Personnel. The entire consulate has three consuls: Kiichi Anzai, Ogihara, and Murakami; and three vice consuls: Nishida, Nagai, and Tanaka. There are seven secretaries, including Hamada. Anzai and Nishida are in charge of the three departments of General Affairs, Foreign Affairs, and Personnel. Ogihara and Nagai are in charge of the departments of Commerce, Economy, and Investigation. Murakami and Tanaka are in charge of the departments of Justice and Police Affairs. Horiuchi is in charge of all of them. In addition to those serving in the consulate, several secretaries will be added and dispatched to Tangshan, Tanggu, Changli, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang to establish consular branch offices. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plan, they will protect overseas Chinese and guide trade. Only the three branch offices currently established are Tanggu, Changli, and Tangshan. Baoding and Shijiazhuang will only be realized after the budget is approved next month due to budget constraints.</p>
<p>As for the establishment of the police department, the representatives of the three northeastern provinces decided on a plan at the meeting in Tianjin. After Administrative Officer Ota returned to the country to report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs prepared a budget, intending to increase the annual reserve fund by 147,950 yuan starting in January of next year. At the same time, the expansion of police power in North China will be implemented. Currently, the Tianjin Consulate Police Station has a total of 110 police officers and patrols. After the expansion, it can be increased by two times compared to the current number. The existing police stations attached to the consulates in Qingdao, Jinan, Beiping, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, and the three railway lines of Pinghan, Beining, and Tianjin-Pukou, as well as the branch offices planned to be established, are all included and are directly under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Police Department. Even the Gubeikou Independent Police Branch will be incorporated into the unified governance. After the unification of the command, the current Police Chief Kazuhisa, whose official rank is relatively low, will be transferred to serve domestically. A person of the "Police Inspector" rank will be dispatched to serve as the director. However, he will still be under the supervision and command of the Tianjin Consulate General. (14th)</p>
<h3>Former Prime Minister Pan Fu Dies in Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Former Prime Minister Pan Fu, after retiring from public office, resided in Tianjin and engaged in business ventures. In recent years, due to poor business performance, and last year the passing of his fifth concubine's son just two days after birth, Pan, overwhelmed by grief, contracted dysentery and pulmonary edema. This year, in June, he came to Beiping from Tianjin, residing at his residence in Maojiawan. After consulting Xiehe Hospital, he was diagnosed with cancerous pleurisy, deemed incurable. Later, he sought treatment from Dr. Lin Baoluo, who diagnosed him with right-sided suppurative pleurisy, with fluid accumulation for three months. His chest was severely affected, and the illness had been delayed. Drainage was attempted, but deemed too late. At that time, his breathing was rapid, with over thirty breaths per minute, and his pulse rate was over one hundred and twenty. His appetite sharply declined, sleep was restless, he was irritable and thirsty, sweated profusely, and urinated little. His heart and lungs were under extreme pressure, considered beyond the reach of medication. On June 25th, he was admitted to the German Hospital, but treatment was ineffective. He returned home. Three or four days ago, Pan contracted dysentery again, eventually succumbing to the illness, passing away at fifteen minutes past midnight on the twelfth. The encoffining took place at six o'clock in the afternoon. His concubine, Zhang, accompanied by his son, Yao Lin, and sons Sen, Tong, Nan, Qi, Xiang, Xing, and Ao, and four daughters attended by his side, grieving intensely. Pan's coffin is scheduled to remain at home for thirty-five days, after which it will be transported back to Jining, Shandong, for burial. Funeral arrangements are being handled by Political Committee members Liu Zhe and former Gendarmerie Commander Wang Qi. Pan's old friends Zhang Ting'e, Zhu Zuozhou, and Wu Qiufang also came from Tianjin to Beiping to assist in all matters. His family telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Xueliang, He Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Chen Tiaoyuan, and Yu Xuezhong to report the death, all of whom sent replies to Beiping to express condolences. Song Zheyuan, being in Tianjin, sent Qin Decun as his representative to pay respects.</p>
<p>According to someone at Pan's residence, around eleven o'clock on the morning of the eleventh, Shen suddenly said the air in the house was bad and instructed servants to move a chair to the courtyard. He was extremely thirsty and asked for tea. Shen suddenly fell into a coma and passed away around twelve o'clock at night. His fourth concubine, hearing of Pan's deteriorating condition, rushed from Tianjin to Beiping at ten o'clock on the evening of the eleventh, also bringing Pan's father's coffin. She met Pan but exchanged only a few words before their final farewell. When Pan's father's coffin was being made, Pan had said he wished to die in his father's place, sleeping in that coffin. Now his words had come true. Pan was quite lucid the day before his death. On the night of the tenth, he instructed his son, Yaoqi, to write his will to his family and letters to friends. His will stated, "I have been ill for years, and I have felt uneasy these past few days, fearing it is not a good sign. If anything untoward happens, you must take good care of your grandfather to avoid causing him grief. It is of utmost importance. Maintain the household and do not disgrace the family name. Living in North China, with such a state of affairs, weighs heavily on my mind, and I have nothing to contribute, for which I am truly ashamed. You should follow my aspirations, serve society, and strive to be upright people. Respect your elders, listen to their teachings, and obey their commands. Relatives, friends, and old subordinates should unite sincerely, help each other, and not betray my trust." The letters to friends were addressed to Song Zheyuan, Zhang Xueliang, Wu Peifu, Jin Yunpeng, Huang Fu, Wang Kemin, Liu Zhe, Ge Dingyuan, Wang Shuhan, and others. The letters stated, "I have been uneasy these past few days, fearing it is not a good omen. If I should not recover, I beg my brothers to kindly persuade my father to avoid causing him grief, which would slightly alleviate my guilt. My children are young; I hope you will instruct them. Cherish and support my old subordinates. Please settle any unfinished matters. This is my deepest prayer." Pan, during his lifetime, was fond of bronzes, stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, calling himself the Master of Huajian Pavilion. The origin of the name: (1) There are three versions of the Huashan Stele: the Huayin version, the Changyuan version, and the Siming version. Pan had already acquired three volumes. The Siming version was obtained for one hundred thousand gold pieces. The Huayin and Changyuan versions are housed in a foreign museum. (2) Pan possessed a Song Dynasty edition of the Zizhi Tongjian. Only one copy of this book exists in the country, hence Pan specifically took the two characters Huajian to name his pavilion. Last year, Pan had a life insurance policy worth thirty thousand yuan at a bank in Beiping. This money can be obtained to cover funeral expenses. (13th)</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Opium and Gambling in Chaozhou and Shantou; Offenders Severely Punished; Opium Addicts Given a Deadline to Register and Quit</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the Guangdong Provincial Government implemented strict prohibitions on opium and gambling, all gambling dens in Shantou have closed down, and all gamblers employed by various companies have been dismissed. Restaurants, hotels, and brothels associated with gambling are desolate and unusually quiet. Prostitutes are relinquishing their licenses at the Flower Tax Bureau, and twenty to thirty people are moving to Hong Kong and Macau daily. After twelve o'clock at night, there is no noise, and law-abiding residents can sleep peacefully. The Shantou military police, to prevent unemployed gamblers from becoming bandits, patrol day and night to protect the city. Some shameless individuals, colluding with ruffians, are gambling Mahjong on the upper floor of a foreign firm in Yushan Street, complacent and thinking, "What the whole city cannot do, I alone can do." The sound of clacking tiles reverberates throughout the night, drawing glares from nearby residents, but the patrols can do nothing. The gamblers are taking it a step further, partnering with ruffians at a large hotel in Qilu to set up a major gambling den, complete with dancing, a bar, and opium smoking, possessing substantial capital and preparing for a grand opening. Gambling is extremely strictly prohibited in various parts of Chaozhou and Shantou. In Chao'an, employees of the Fengle Company were arrested by the police for playing Mahjong, each fined one thousand yuan. News of arrests and fines in other places is frequent. Gamblers are well aware that they must restrain themselves. The Shantou Municipal Government recently received orders to establish an Opium Prohibition Committee, to be established within the month. Three local individuals will be nominated as standing committee members, one serving as chairman, to handle daily affairs. The Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee will assign personnel to participate in guidance and supervision. After the Opium Prohibition Committee is established, it will set up opium cessation hospitals and clinics to assist opium addicts in quitting. All opium addicts in the city must register by the end of the year. Those under forty years of age are not allowed to register. Only those over forty years of age are allowed to register and be issued a license. Those under forty years of age must be admitted to the hospital for treatment, with a thirty-day deadline to quit and be discharged. Registration certificates will be issued bi-annually, with ordinary certificates costing five yuan per quarter and special certificates costing six jiao per quarter. Regarding party, government, military, financial, educational, and public officials and employees of various agencies who privately smoke opium, they must immediately quit within this month. If they privately smoke without reporting to their superiors, they will be punished according to law if discovered. Once the Opium Prohibition Committee is established, it will implement the central government's regulations on opium cessation and inspection, targeting civil servants of Shantou without leniency or pardon.</p>
<h3>Opium Trafficking King of Northern Anhui, Qin Zixiu, Arrested in Bengbu; Accomplice Wang Congzhou Also Apprehended</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The poisonous atmosphere of opium in northern Anhui is pervasive, becoming more severe in recent years. Although the authorities have strictly enforced prohibition, the spread of opium has not diminished. The reason for this is the immersion and degradation of addicts, their stubbornness and inflexibility, and the secret trafficking and sale by treacherous individuals, which is the main factor in promoting the scourge of opium. The Public Security Bureau here recently arrested Qin Zixiu, a notorious wanted criminal known as the Opium King of Northern Anhui, and his accomplice Wang Congzhou, which has attracted considerable attention from the general public. According to investigations, Qin is originally from Suxian, a notorious scoundrel on the Huai River, with hundreds of followers, renowned in the Huai and Si regions. Younger members of the gang often call him "Young Master Qin." He roams the streets, committing numerous crimes, and he, along with the executed Zhu Yanqiu, Du Molin, and Chen Bingheng, were figures of concern to the Anhui provincial authorities. Last winter, the provincial government telegraphed the Bengbu Public Security Bureau, ordering his arrest and legal punishment. Qin, having heard the news, fled without a trace. This summer, he returned to Bengbu and was recently accused by eleven citizens, including Wu Huating, to the Public Security Bureau, leading to his arrest. According to Wu's accusations, which are based on documented facts, his notorious deeds are evident, and he is considered a public pest. The accusations include: (1) In 1925, during the time of the warlord Anwu Army, Qin served as a minor leader. While stationed at Linhuai Pass, he colluded with the bandit leader Zheng Yufang. Due to a dispute over the spoils, he secretly strangled the bandit and his wife, Zhu. He also colluded with the bandit leader Gong Huaiyin. In order to rob property, Qin, seeing the wealth, took advantage of his position and murdered Gong and his wife. (2) In 1926, Qin returned to Bengbu and became sworn brothers with Zhang Zonghan (also known as Zhang Dingchen), a notorious bandit from the northern countryside of Huaiyuan, engaging in numerous robberies. (3) In 1931, when the Seventh Division was stationed in Bengbu, suppressing bandits in Guzhen, seven bandits were captured and taken to the division headquarters in Southern Suzhou, claiming that Qin Zixiu, Zhang Dingchen, and Ma Xunchen were supplying them with firearms and ammunition. The Seventh Division Commander Wang Jun ordered the Twenty-first Brigade Commander Li Wenbin to arrest Qin in Sanyili, Bengbu, and escort him to the division headquarters in Southern Suzhou. Qin, being incredibly resourceful, was released with the help of gentry and merchants. (4) During the tenure of former Public Security Bureau Director Yun, Qin colluded with the bandit Lu Keqin, robbing in Shouchangli in this city, killing a patrol officer. Former Director Yun dispatched police to arrest Qin and send Lu Keqin for execution by firing squad. In addition, it was stated that Qin was wanted and arrested by Chairman Liu of the Provincial Government in 1935, avoiding arrest by fleeing elsewhere, and recently returning to Bengbu to sell opium, known as the Opium King of Northern Anhui, a widely known reputation, recruiting hundreds of followers, including Wang Congzhou, as his henchmen, acting solely under Qin's command. Public Security Bureau Director Lu Zongjing reported this and, on the night before last, sent officers along with armed police to arrest Qin Zixiu and Wang Congzhou at their residences. Yesterday (the 12th), they were transferred to the Fengyang County Government for legal action. Locals generally agree that the case should be severely punished to eliminate harm to the people. The authorities may impose the death penalty.</p>
<h3>Jing-Qu Railway Changes Route, Abandoning the Quzhou Section in Zhejiang, Extending from Xuancheng to Guixi</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Ministry of Railways' construction of the Jing-Qu Railway originally planned to start from Quzhou in Zhejiang and Xuancheng in Anhui, with Xuancheng connecting to the Jiangnan Railway's Xuanwu section of the Jiangnan Company, allowing it to reach Nanjing via Wuhu and the Jingwu section. The entire route was 350 kilometers long. In July, the Engineering Bureau was established in Xuancheng, with Zheng Hua as the Director and Yuan Menghong as the Chief of Engineering. Construction began immediately. Recently, after careful inspection by the Ministry of Railways, it was deemed necessary to modify the route. It has been decided to abandon the Quzhou section in Zhejiang and extend directly south from Xuancheng to Jiangxi, passing through Ningguo, Qimen, Jingdezhen, Leping, and ending at Guixi, extending the length to 400 kilometers. Although this plan has not been officially announced, over 5,000 workers originally in Zhejiang have been transferred back to Anhui. It is estimated that a total of 14 million cubic meters of earthwork is required for the entire route. For land requisitioned from civilians, the price is divided into three grades: 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 10 yuan per mu. The cost of moving graves is also stipulated at 5 yuan. A total of over 900,000 railway ties are required. To promote domestically produced timber, it was decided to procure locally produced chestnut trees from Ningguo and Qimen counties along the route, as tie material, in consultation with the Anhui Provincial Government. The Provincial Government welcomed this and established the Anhui Province Domestic Timber Sales Office within the Wuhu Engineering Bureau to liaise with timber merchants in each county, responsible for contracting. The first batch of 60,000 ties has been contracted for procurement, with each tie costing only 2 yuan in legal tender, saving much compared to imported products. Therefore, it is planned to increase this amount gradually in the future. The entire route is expected to be completed and open to traffic by the end of next year. The work is being carried out simultaneously in sections, with nearly 15,000 to 16,000 workers. The steel rails will be 70 pounds in weight. The locomotive budget requires over 20 locomotives. It is heard that the Ministry of Railways' Materials Purchasing Committee is preparing to place an order with Britain due to the Boxer Indemnity funds. The total cost of construction is estimated at 30 million yuan. The agricultural produce in southern Anhui and the border of Jiangxi is extremely abundant, but transportation has always been inconvenient. After the completion of this route, it will connect with the Jiangnan Railway to reach Nanjing and connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which will connect with the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, achieving satisfactory results in both freight and passenger transport.

<h3>Songjiang: Water Patrol Secretly Arrests Suspected Thieves</h3>
<p>Fei Gongxia, the captain of the Water Patrol Team of the local Public Security Bureau, conducted a rendezvous patrol in Fengjing yesterday and discovered two suspicious individuals in the town. He immediately went forward to question them. A six-inch Browning pistol, number 398, was found in Wang A'gen's crotch. His companion, Zhang Zixian, also known as Zhang Jinlong, nicknamed Zhang Mulong, was evasive and clearly not a good person. They have been taken in for questioning.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Child Crushed to Death by Fallen Ginkgo</h3>
<p>Outside the East Gate, inside the Land Temple, there are several large ginkgo trees that bear abundant fruit every year, contracted out by villagers. This year, He Haibao from Xinfeng Township contracted it. Yesterday, while collecting the fruit, they used bamboo poles to knock them down, instructing nearby village children to pick them up, paying them four copper coins for each full basket. As the fruit on the top of the tree could not be knocked down, He climbed to the top of the tree. While working, a large branch suddenly broke and fell to the ground, instantly crushing Chen Tianxiong and Chen Runsheng to death. Their flesh and blood were blurred beyond recognition, a tragic sight. He and several lightly injured children were taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Another Case of Grain Tax Embezzlement Discovered</h3>
<p>The West Counter Grain Tax Office of the County Government has recently discovered another case of tax corruption. The perpetrator is the younger brother of Zhou Zhiyun, the head of the counter. He has been detained and imprisoned. Last month, the Grain Tax Office discovered that an employee, Zhou Jianwo, had forged grain certificates and privately collected national taxes. This has now been verified. He has been sentenced to three years imprisonment and is in jail. Unexpectedly, internal opinions have arisen among internal employees, because someone secretly reported the internal corruption to the Finance Department, which sent Chen to Changshu to investigate. It was discovered that Zhou Ruizhi, an employee of the counter, had privately collected taxes from a Jiang family noodle shop in the alley, secretly embezzling them for many years. Commissioner Chen has now found evidence and immediately arrested and imprisoned Zhou Ruizhi. At the same time, all old certificates from the West Counter have been sealed to facilitate a thorough investigation. It is reported that Zhou Ruizhi, the perpetrator of this embezzlement, and the already imprisoned forger of grain certificates, are both younger brothers of the current head of the West Counter, Zhou Zhiyun.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Three Villages Robbed in a Row in Weiting Township</h3>
<p>During this time when new grains are being harvested in the countryside, bandits are taking the opportunity to be active, leading to frequent robberies in recent days. Although the authorities have tried their best to search, the bandits move about, making it difficult to pacify the situation. The other day, Weiting Township reported a bandit alarm. Three villages were robbed in a single night. That evening, more than ten bandits, wearing short gray clothes, speaking with a Hakka accent, their faces painted, and their heads wrapped in white cloth, first robbed Zhu Shoufu and Zhang Fuxiang's families in Jinsha East Henggang, then robbed Zhang Zhucun's and Yu Jinfu's families in Wenchao West Zhang Village and Guapeng, taking away a new boat before leaving. Unexpectedly, when the bandits passed through the affluent Zuanzhu Village, they went to Li Houfu's house and ransacked it, then fled west. The next day, the victims reported to the Weiting Fifth Precinct, which dispatched police to pursue them. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau was requested to send additional police to the countryside to investigate and arrest them based on the information.</p>
<h3>Bandits Extort Doctor</h3>
<p>Gu Dingyun, a doctor from Zhongzheng, Huguan, has a clinic in the town and a branch clinic at Bai Mu Bridge in Suzhou. Gu's family is moderately well-off, attracting the attention of bandits. Recently, someone, pretending to be a patient, asked him to go to the countryside to treat an illness. Unexpectedly, there was no patient when he arrived. Then he received a threatening letter from someone calling himself the First Army of Taihu Lake, extorting 2,000 yuan, to be delivered at the Wenchang Temple on the 12th. Gu reported this to the police station, which sent police to wait. As a result, only two suspects were apprehended. The search is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Election Ballot Counting in Wuxi</h3>
<p>The matter of the election of national representatives from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and professional groups in Wuxi was completed on the 12th and 13th with the respective election of candidates in various rural areas, parks, and the county government. It is reported that there were 29 industrial groups with 222 votes and 63 trade associations with 661 votes participating. In addition, six trade associations, including entertainment, coal, construction, photography, flour mills, and Yao Huo, were not allowed to vote by provincial telegram because they had not joined the Chamber of Commerce. After these associations requested the Chamber of Commerce to temporarily join and participate in the vote, a telegram was submitted to the province for approval. Consequently, 48 votes were cast at the county government on the afternoon of the 13th. The ballot boxes from the eight counties in the Second District were sent to the district on the evening of the 13th. District Supervisor Zang Qifang ordered the counting to begin at 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 14th), divided into two sessions: the first session for professional groups, the second session for commercial groups, and the third session for industrial groups. The ballot counting was carried out in the order of Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Changshu, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Taicang, and Kunshan. Due to the non-participation of the Wuxian Farmers' Association, the number of votes was relatively small. The results of the ballot counting are as follows: (1) In industrial groups, Wuxi and Suzhou had the most votes, Jiangyin, Wujin, and Changshu followed, while Kunshan only had six votes. Taicang (seven votes) and Wujiang (no votes) were all invalid. As a result, Sun Xiangfeng, Xu Chiyu, and Tang Pu'an received the most votes, followed by Zhang Gongren, Zhang Jiesheng, Wu Yunyi, Chen Changgeng, and Gui Wuchen. (2) In commercial groups, Xue Mingjian, Qian Sunqing, Zhang Shoupeng, Yin Zhongren, Jiang Weixian, Yu Xunlu, Pang Shusen, Yu Xiaochuan, Yan Huiyu, Cheng Ganqing, Ding Zhixiang, and Lan Bohua received more votes. The above is the ballot counting for Wuxi County. It was completed at 4:30 p.m. More details will follow. (3) For agricultural groups, only Wuxi County has been counted, with Cheng Yicheng and Jiang Bosen receiving the most votes.</p>
<h3>Pagoda Lantern on Jiangjian Ridge</h3>
<p>Outside the North Dipper of this city, on Jiangjian Ridge, there is the tradition of piling Pagoda Lanterns every year on the 30th of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. This year, in front of Jiang Renmao's pottery shop, over two thousand earthenware basins were used to pile a Pagoda Lantern, a total of seven stories. The entire pagoda was decorated with over two thousand colorful electric lights. To the east of the pagoda, over twenty light sheds and two colorful arches were built. It was lit up last night, attracting crowds of viewers, a lively scene, the grandest in over ten years.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Three Points for Careful General Election</h3>
<p>Wang Xingfu, Lin Zhiting, and Lu Jia of the Jiangdu First District, Wu Yangchen of the Qing Dynasty, Wang Zaishan of the Fourth District, Ji Nuo of the Fifth District, Liu Bingqian, Gao Puqing, and Sang Xiaochu of the Eighth District, have issued a notice to all citizens of the county for the sake of a cautious general election of national representatives. The general idea is that there are three points to be cautious about in this general election: (1) Be cautious about the recommendation of the candidate. Can he be our representative and cope with everything in the present era? (2) Be cautious about the candidate's scholarship. Can he be our representative, benefiting the country above and benefiting the people below? (3) Be cautious about the current position of the candidate. Is he seeking wealth and strength for the country and relieving the suffering of the people?</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Button Factory Employee Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Yin Guoquan, a partner at the Lijia Button Factory in Jiaxing Tang, (23 years old, from Kunshan, Jiangsu,) had been studying at the factory for over eight years. He quit for some reason in July last year. He rejoined the factory in January this year. At the beginning of this month, he went to Bengbu to handle raw materials and returned on the 10th. He stayed at the Tianhu Hotel on Jianqiao Street that night. On the 11th, he went to the factory, and on the 12th, he left the factory again. He stayed at the Quanhu Hotel that night. For unknown reasons, he bought a small bottle of poison and, at night, wrote seven suicide notes and took the poison. At about 5 a.m. on the 13th, he called out with abdominal pain. The tea boy heard him and entered, finding him unconscious. There was a bottle of poison and suicide notes on the table. Knowing that he had taken poison, he informed the Guanyinkai police station, who sent a chief officer to the scene. Yin was sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment, but his internal organs were already necrotic, and he could not be saved. He died at about 7 a.m. The Public Security Bureau reported to the local court for an autopsy. Qian Fanfang, the manager of the button factory, assigned employee Zhou Songlin to the scene to prepare a coffin and collect the body. The suicide notes have been distributed separately. According to the suicide notes, the reason for the suicide was due to the oppression of a bad environment. His brother-in-law, Tian Shengrong, from the north, will come to collect the coffin and transport it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: Wasteland Reclaimed for Cotton Planting</h3>
<p>The Great School Field in this county, totaling 70 hectares, was previously occupied by the Tonghai Reclamation and Pasture Company. It was not reclaimed as a school field until 1928 and has been left barren as pastureland. The county education agency only leases it out for 200 yuan per year, with the lessee harvesting reeds. Now, locals, including Li Changming, have leased the school field. Based on the principle of making the best use of the land and resources, they have formulated a ten-year plan to start reclaiming the land for cotton planting and livestock raising. The term is ten years. The first year's rent is 200 national currency, increasing annually thereafter. Upon expiration, the school field will be taken back by the county government. Yesterday, they submitted a document along with the plan to the county government for transfer to the Department of Education for record, to show their sincerity.</p>
<h3>Pests Devour Autumn Beans</h3>
<p>In the southeast districts of Moyang County, due to continuous rain and flooding, the autumn harvest is hopeless. The autumn beans in districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 are still lush, which is very gratifying to the farmers. Recently, bean worms (commonly known as bean dans) have been found in the fields, eating the bean leaves and multiplying rapidly. They are everywhere in the fields. The worms are yellowish-green and wriggle in the branches and leaves, like silkworms. Each autumn bean plant has dozens of them. The bean leaves are eaten, the branches and stems wither and become bare, and they do not bear fruit. The farmers are extremely anxious and flock to the fields to catch them and feed them to pigs. The worm oil can also be used for lighting. In recent days, the country lanes have been filled with them. If this continues for another half month, the autumn beans in each township will be completely devoured. It is hoped that the agricultural authorities will quickly organize a large-scale capture or offer to buy them, which may still provide a slight remedy and prevent recurrence next year.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing: Husband Killer Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Chen Zhangshi, a Shaoxing Tangpu villager, was found to have conspired with her lover, Chen Sifang, and her older brother, Zhang Changshan, to kill her husband, Chen Xiaoquan, with green wooden sticks in July. After the discovery, the Tangpu police station arrested the adulterous woman, Chen Zhangshi, and sent her to the court for trial. Chen Sifang and others are still at large. The court has now completed its investigation of the adulterous woman and sentenced her to nine years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou-Caoe Road Construction Postponed</h3>
<p>The construction of the Hangzhou-Caoe section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was originally scheduled to begin on October 1st. However, the town leaders of Changan Town and others have submitted requests to the county government to transfer the request to the engineering office to postpone the start of construction for three weeks to protect the rice harvest. It is now heard that the engineering office has approved a postponement of twenty days, setting the start date for October 21st.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: 100,000 Sandbank Residents Petition</h3>
<p>Over 100,000 sandbank residents in eastern Xiaoshan, whose original sandbank land was sold by the Sandbank Bureau to new owners, causing the farmers, who survived the disaster, to have no way to appeal. After Magistrate Li took office, over four thousand farming households in Nansha, Zheshan, petitioned the county, and directly telegraphed the provincial and central governments, requesting the revocation of the order, and immediately inviting the original owners to pay the land price, the original owners should have priority, so that the landowners don't exploit and benefit, and maintain the lives of farmers. It is believed that the provincial and county authorities will approve their request.</p>

<h3>Zhu Peide Arrives in Shanghai to Mediate the Situation in Guangxi; Bai Chongxi Decides to Serve in Nanjing; Ju Zheng and Others to Return North in a Week</h3>
<p>Chief of Staff Zhu Peide was dispatched to the south last month to mediate the situation in Guangxi. He completed his mission some days ago and returned north on the President Jackson of the Dollar Steamship Lines from Hong Kong. He arrived in Shanghai at approximately 11 a.m. on the 14th, mooring at Buoys 13 and 14 in the Huangpu River. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, and Garrison Headquarters Secretary Wang Zhinan and others went to welcome him. After disembarking, Zhu immediately transferred to the Jingguang launch and crossed the river. At 11:40 a.m., he landed at the Xin Guan wharf and went directly to his private residence on Bi Xun Road to rest. Yang Hu was scheduled to host a welcome dinner for Zhu at the International Hotel at 7:30 p.m. on the 14th. Zhu plans to stay in Shanghai briefly before returning to Nanjing to assume his duties. According to Zhu, the Guangxi situation has been completely resolved, and the aftermath is currently being handled within Guangxi Province. Bai Chongxi is scheduled to go to Guangzhou within the next few days to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Bai had originally intended to go abroad for inspection, but after Chiang Kai-shek's earnest persuasion, he has abandoned his plans to go abroad and has decided to serve in Nanjing. As to whether he will accompany Chairman Chiang north immediately after arriving in Guangzhou is yet to be determined. President Ju and others are scheduled to return north in a week. Regarding the Beihai Incident and the disposition of the 19th Route Army, he has not heard anything about them since leaving Guangzhou nearly a week ago. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a day or two before returning to Nanjing to assume his duties.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Goes to Nanjing; Xu Kan and Xu Jianping Accompany Him</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, departed last night on a special express train attached to a parlor car to Nanjing to preside over the routine meeting of the Executive Yuan.

<h3>Lu Zuofu Discusses Sichuan Province's Construction, Negotiates Public Bond Mortgages, and Overcomes Reasons for Failure</h3>
<p>Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to host guests on the maiden voyage of the Minsheng Company's new ship, the "Minben". He personally received guests aboard. When a reporter from the Central News Agency visited the ship, he interviewed Lu about the mortgage of Sichuan public bonds to banks and the construction of Sichuan Province. According to Lu, preliminary negotiations with banks have been conducted in Shanghai regarding the mortgage of Sichuan public bonds, but no specific decisions have been made. He will go to Nanjing for official business tomorrow (today) and will return to Shanghai before returning to Sichuan to discuss the matter in detail. The construction funds for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway have been confirmed, a portion of the route has been surveyed, and materials have been ordered. Construction will begin as soon as the materials arrive. As for other construction projects, due to the many tasks needing to be done and the complexity of the situation, experts have been dispatched to conduct separate investigations and studies. There are currently no concrete implementation methods. Many construction projects in China have failed in the past, mostly due to inadequate preparation and incomplete planning. Therefore, he is committed to overcoming these reasons for failure in the construction of Sichuan Province, making thorough preparations first, and then proceeding with the work, in order to achieve success in one stroke.

<h3>Minsheng Company Hosts Visit Yesterday; "Minben" Ship Makes Maiden Voyage Today</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Guests are Invited, Impressed by Elegance; Cargo Holds and Passenger Cabins Have Distinctive Features; Receptions Offered at Various Ports Along Chongqing Route</p>
<p>The "Minben" ship, built by the Minsheng Industrial Company, is the first fast, large ship on the Yangtze River. It departs today on its maiden voyage to Chongqing. Yesterday, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., at the Minsheng Wharf in Nanshi (i.e., Wharves 11 and 12), guests were invited to visit. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attentive Hospitality</p>
<p>The "Minben" ship was docked at Wharf 11 in Nanshi. Yesterday at 1 p.m., the entire ship was adorned with flags of various nations. Lu Zuofu, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Construction and General Manager of Minsheng Industrial Company, Zheng Bicheng, Director of the Ship Department of the Minsheng General Company, Zhang Shulin, Manager of Minsheng Shanghai, and all the employees of Minsheng were on board to welcome guests. Over a thousand people, including Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Sheng Pingru, Xu Zufan, Zhu Ziqiao, and Li Zhiyi, were in attendance. They were first guided on a tour and then invited to the fourth floor for refreshments. The event ended at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Ship Structure The "Minben" ship was built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. It is 221 feet long, 33 feet wide, 11.5 feet deep, and has a draft of 9.5 feet. It has a horsepower of 2,500 and can travel 16.17 nautical miles per hour. It uses a double-bottom hull and has six large cargo holds and eight tung oil tanks. It can carry 3,000 bales of cotton yarn and 180 tons of tung oil. The stern rudder adopts a streamlined design, making it slightly curved and rounded, which is an innovation for ships on the upper Yangtze. The most special feature is that the bow has two 15-ton cranes. The bow is over 70 feet long, and the middle hold is over 80 feet long. The bottom of the hold is paved with rails, as the company plans to transport railway cars and locomotive railway materials for the Chongqing-Chengdu Railway in the future. Therefore, it has designed and built this large ship suitable for transportation needs. From now on, there will be no problems transporting all kinds of iron bars and steel parts into Sichuan. The ship's engine was purchased from Socony's Yangtze River ship, and the cost of the hull and other materials still amounted to 500,000 yuan, the same as its sister ship, the "Minyuan". The ship is currently insured for 450,000 yuan. Excluding a 10% self-insurance, the remaining 90% is underwritten by various Chinese and foreign insurance companies in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Passenger Cabin Facilities</p>
<p>Location and facilities of passenger cabins: (1) Special-class cabins are located at the rear of the third floor. There are five rooms, each with two berths, accommodating a total of ten people. The beds use springs, and the mattresses are made of Simmons. There are wardrobes and new-style washbasins. There is a corridor in the middle leading to the dining room. The corridor has a skylight. Each room and dining room is sealed with plywood and painted with artistic lacquer. The facilities are complete and luxurious. There are also two bathrooms and toilets. The kitchen has an electric refrigerator that can make 200 pounds of ice every day, keeping food fresh and hygienic. There are tables and chairs behind the dining room for cooling off and viewing the scenery. (2) Official cabins are located at the front of the third floor. There are seven rooms, five with double berths and two with single berths, accommodating a total of twelve people. Most official cabins on other ships have stacked berths, which are inconvenient to climb up and down. This ship uses single berths and has cotton mattresses, which are extremely comfortable. The dining room is in the center and has a skylight, imitating the style of the special-class cabins. It is spacious and comfortable, cool in summer and warm in winter, making it the best among all Yangtze River ships. The dining room has two "dou" openings leading to the front corridor, making it very convenient for viewing the scenery and cooling off. There is also a bathroom and toilet. (3) Room cabins are located at the front of the first floor. There are five rooms, each with four berths, accommodating a total of twenty people. There is one dining room and two bathrooms and toilets. Most room cabins on other ships are located next to the boiler room or engine room, where the temperature is quite high. In summer, it is unbearable for passengers. This ship is located above the cargo hold, completely eliminating this problem. Because the dining room is in the front of the ship, it is cooler. (4) Third-class cabins are located at the rear of the second floor. There are five rooms, each with sixteen berths, accommodating a total of eighty people. There are four men's toilets, two men's showers, and one women's shower and toilet. The third-class cabins on this ship are simply an enlargement of the room cabins. The berths are comfortable, and the air circulates well. The space between the berths is wide, making traffic convenient. Tables can also be set up for meals. Third-class cabins are comfortable and have bathrooms, which is a unique feature of the company's ships. There are two large luggage rooms on both sides of the boiler room, surrounded by iron bars, making it easy to store luggage. (5) All classes of passenger cabins have heating facilities, so it is not cold even in severe winter. The stern of the fourth floor and the rooftop garden are available for cooling off and taking walks in the summer. Other amenities include electric fans and doorbells, multiple bathrooms and toilets, clean drinking water, a library for borrowing books, a radio receiver to announce important news from various ports, and musical instruments and entertainment to alleviate the loneliness of long journeys, all of which make passengers feel convenient.</p>
<p>Cargo Hold Features The bow of this ship is over 70 feet long and can accommodate 15 cars. The cargo hold openings are particularly large, and the bottom of the hold is paved with rails, which can accommodate locomotives and other heavy machinery. There is also a refrigerated hold at the stern, which can hold five tons of fresh goods. This is also not available on other ships on the Yangtze River. Regarding the safety of the ship, the hull of this ship is sturdy, the materials are the best, the design is excellent, and the layout is appropriate. The forward hold also has a double bottom, providing the best safety guarantee. In addition to the various fire safety equipment on the deck, the cargo hold also has steam fire extinguishing pipes to prevent fire alarms, which is not available on any Chinese or foreign ships on the Yangtze River. The ship travels steadily and quickly. The speed of this ship is 16.17 miles per hour, setting a new record for commercial ships on the Yangtze River. It only takes eight or nine days to go from Shanghai to Chongqing, and only five or six days to go from Chongqing to Shanghai. Other ships on the Yangtze River have not been able to combine stability and speed, but this ship has both. After numerous tests by Chinese and foreign experts, it is considered to be very satisfactory and perfect, truly a blessing for the shipping industry.</p>
<p>Departure for Chongqing Today</p>
<p>The "Minben" ship departs on its maiden voyage to Chongqing today. On the first voyage today, the income from freight alone loaded in Shanghai amounts to more than 60,000 yuan, not including passenger fares. The captain of the ship is Zhou Haiqing (formerly the captain of the "Minquan" ship), the manager is Xie Sasheng, the first mate is Yin Pingzhi, the second mate is Yao Weilin, and the chief engineer is Xu Jiatang. The ticket prices are lower than those of British Jardine Matheson and Swire. From Shanghai to Chongqing, a special-class Western meal costs 200 yuan per person, a special-class Chinese meal costs 160 yuan per person, a second-class ticket costs 70 yuan per person, and a third-class ticket costs 35 yuan per person. The ports of call along the ship's route are Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Yichang, Wanxian, and Chongqing. According to Manager Zhang of the Shanghai branch, the "Minben" and "Minyuan" are sister ships. When there is flooding on the Yangtze River, they specialize in the Shanghai-Chongqing route. When the water level is low, they specialize in the Shanghai-Yichang route. The "Minben" ship is scheduled to make its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Chongqing on the evening of the 15th and plans to invite visitors to visit it when passing through Nanjing, Hankou, Yichang, and Wanxian. The "Changyuan" ship is expected to be completed in about a week and will join the Shanghai-Chongqing route.</p>
<p>Continuing to Build Seven Ships</p>
<p>The Minsheng Company has now become the only major company in the river shipping industry. It has a total of ten routes, including Chongqing-Shanghai, Chongqing-Yichang, Shanghai-Yichang, Chongqing-Hankou, Chongqing-Xuzhou, Xuzhou-Jialing, Luzhou-Deng, Chongqing-Fuling, Fuling-Wanxian, and Chongqing-Taizhou. It uses 45 ships, including the "Minyuan," "Minben," "Minquan," "Minfeng," "Minzhi," "Minsu," and "Minyi" to regularly run the Shanghai-Chongqing route, and the "Minzu," "Minlian," "Guangyao," and three other ships regularly run the Shanghai-Yichang route. The company is now taking another step forward and is building seven new Yangtze River ships in Shanghai, ranging in length from 150 feet to 170-180 feet. The drawings and costs have been submitted by the shipyard to the company for review in preparation for construction.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives Petition; Demand that the Municipal Council Maintain the Number of Rickshaws; Replace the Mutual Aid Society and Abolish Quotas</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, rickshaw pullers in the Special District, in protest of the Municipal Council's reduction of rickshaws, dispatched over three hundred people, including Chen Guobiao, Lu Shaode, Chen Hongji, Yu Baohe, Qian Youfu, Chen A'er, He Jintao, Xu Zhaoyuan, He Shunhou, Yang Agou, Lu Yinsheng, and Xia Qiyun, to the Municipal Council yesterday morning at 10 a.m. Because of the large number of people, they were stopped by police. They then publicly elected Chen Guobiao and seven others to see the Chief Executive. The Chief Executive was out, so they were received by General Manager Feixin Dun. Because of the language barrier, He Dekui was asked to translate. After inquiring about the petitioners' intentions, he individually questioned Lu Shaode, Ka Zhangfa, and others about how much they had left over each day after paying rent. The rickshaw pullers replied that due to the sluggish market, they only had 40-50 cents left, which was not enough to cover expenses. He asked the rickshaw pullers whether they thought it was better to have more rickshaws or fewer. They replied that because of rural bankruptcy, villagers came to Shanghai to make a living, so it was better to have more rickshaws so that they could be distributed to maintain their livelihoods. Mr. He also asked whether registered rickshaw pullers should be limited in number or not. The rickshaw pullers replied that not limiting the number would reduce the unemployed population. Mr. He replied that the petition would be translated and submitted to the Chief Executive for consideration. He also said that the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Special Committee and the Municipal Council's Huang Affairs Committee would hold meetings to discuss the rickshaw pullers' demands and promised to consider them. The representatives were satisfied and left. The text of their petition is as follows: "Petition Regarding: We, Chen Guobiao, Lu Shaode, Chen Hongji, Yu Baohe, Qian Youfu, Chen A'er, and others, the General Representatives of Rickshaw Pullers in the Special District, have been making a living by pulling rickshaws in Shanghai for many years. Unexpectedly, in 1934, the Public Concession Municipal Council, under the pretext of improving the lives of rickshaw pullers, arbitrarily reformed the rickshaw pulling system, established a Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, and extracted 15,000 yuan of blood and sweat from us rickshaw pullers every month for the Municipal Council personnel to squander. Although it is called relief, in fact, the rickshaw pullers do not get any benefit at all. Now that the Mutual Aid Society has been established for 26 months, it has absorbed as much as 390,000 yuan of our rickshaw pullers' blood and sweat. All matters are handled like a monopoly. It shouts loudly to provide relief to rickshaw pullers, but it is truly irrelevant to the rickshaw pullers themselves. Therefore, it must be fundamentally reorganized. We rickshaw pullers in Shanghai have never been subject to any restrictions and have been free to come and go. Since the Municipal Council started registering rickshaw pullers, we have been constantly interfered with by patrolmen, who strictly check our armbands and photos, making it impossible to maintain our business and causing us great pain. Moreover, your Council has implemented a quota system for registration, causing unemployed rickshaw pullers to wander aimlessly and unable to make a living, which is not a sincere intention to fundamentally improve and relieve rickshaw pullers. Recently, we have repeatedly seen reports that the Rickshaw Committee has proposed to your Council to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the Concession, cutting off the livelihood of us poor rickshaw pullers. If this is implemented, we rickshaw pullers in Shanghai will swear to resist it to the death. You must know that reducing one rickshaw means cutting off the livelihood of four rickshaw pullers, and so on. We believe that your Council does not understand the national conditions of our country and acts rashly, which is tantamount to cutting off toes to fit the shoes, and is greatly contrary to the system of relieving rickshaw pullers and improving their lives. Based on the opinions of the majority of rickshaw pullers, Guobiao and others convened an emergency meeting of rickshaw puller representatives from five districts on the afternoon of the 7th of this month. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Reorganize the Mutual Aid Society in the shortest possible time, and order the monopolizing personnel to thoroughly publish the accounts from the past. The affairs of the society should be returned to the management of both labor and management of the rickshaw industry in order to seek thorough and appropriate relief. (2) Abolish the quota for rickshaw puller registration and establish a permanent rickshaw puller registration office to relieve unemployed rickshaw pullers. (3) Cancel the proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws in order to avoid increasing unemployed rickshaw pullers and to maintain the business of those with rickshaws in order to save the actual livelihood of rickshaw pullers. The above is submitted to your Council for review and acceptance. We will be extremely grateful and await orders. Submitted to the Chief Executive of the Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Reduces Rickshaws; Citizens Oppose</h3>
<p>The Needs of Citizens and Livelihood of Rickshaw Pullers Should be Considered; Public Bus Routes Should be Restricted</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Public Concession Municipal Council has proposed to reduce the number of public rickshaws. Rickshaw owners and pullers, because it is a matter of vital interest to them, have held meetings one after another to firmly oppose it. Various citizens' groups in the city, for the sake of convenient transportation, have also successively issued declarations, listing the impropriety of reducing the number of rickshaws. The original text is as follows: "The Public Concession Municipal Council has recently proposed to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the Concession in order to regulate traffic. As representatives of the citizens, our association believes that we cannot remain silent. In recent years, the expansion, extension, and addition of roads in the Public Concession have not kept pace with the increase in public bus routes. As it stands, the roads are often crowded with pedestrians, and on roads less than 30 feet wide, public buses as wide as 10 feet and as high as 25 feet travel back and forth, such as the No. 1, No. 5, and No. 15 public buses that pass through Henan Road, Datong Road, Nanjing Road, and North Sichuan Road. This has a significant impact on municipal traffic, pedestrian safety, and obstructing advertisements and business along the road. For the sake of the municipality and for the sake of commerce, the Municipal Council should restrict the route and number of public buses in order to benefit the citizens. This is one point. In fact, due to the different economic needs of Chinese and foreign citizens in the Public Concession, Westerners live in foreign houses along Jing'an Temple Road and the areas outside the concession. Cars can reach their doors directly, so most of them have cars for transportation and do not worry about the number of public rickshaws. For Westerners, the amount of rickshaws may not have much of an effect on transportation, but the more than one million Chinese in the Concession are limited by their economic ability. The number of people who own cars is very small. The majority of Chinese rely on rickshaws as their only means of transportation, and public buses cannot reach the remote streets and lanes where they live. Without rickshaws for transportation, the more than one million Chinese in the Concession would feel greatly inconvenienced. For the sake of Chinese convenience, the Municipal Council should not reduce the number of public rickshaws in order to benefit the citizens. This is the second point. Moreover, looking at the traffic management policies of major cities in Europe and the United States, the development of electric and steam transportation businesses in major cities is usually expanded beyond the road surface to the air or the ground. For example, in New York in the United States, in addition to public buses and trams on the road surface, there are also elevated and underground trams. Each vehicle does not run on the same road to avoid traffic congestion. In contrast, in our city, Nanjing Road, Avenue Edward VII, Henan Road, North Sichuan Road, and others often have public buses and trams running side by side. This greatly endangers traffic management, pedestrian safety, and the business of shops. Is it because the owner of the public bus company is the Chairman of the Municipal Council that they get this special convenience? The Municipal Council's reduction of rickshaws is based on the proposal of a few Western taxpayers. As representatives of more than one million Chinese taxpayers, we cannot sit idly by. For the sake of the needs of citizens and convenient transportation, we should restrict the routes of public buses and maintain the existing number of rickshaws. Otherwise, we will seek other effective ways to benefit the citizens and maintain traffic. We respectfully declare this and hope that you will understand."</p>

<h3>Horiuchi and Tajiri's Movements</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Tajiri, the new First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, has been transferred from Acting Consul General in Tianjin, and Horiuchi, the former First Secretary of the Embassy, has been transferred in return. After Horiuchi arrived in Tianjin to take office and complete the handover, he left Tianjin by air to Qingdao on the 12th.

It is yet to be decided whether he will go to Nanjing to meet with Kawagoe or continue to Guangzhou on the same ship. The decision will be made upon arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Aviation: Joint Transportation to be Realized; Shanghai-Guangdong Planes Can Land in Hong Kong; Station to be Established After Permit Arrives</h3>
<p>After the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) establishes a station in Hong Kong, and has obtained British approval, after the station is established, airmail destined for Britain arriving in Hong Kong can be jointly transported to Britain by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency made a special visit yesterday morning to record the following:</p>
<p>Landing in Hong Kong</p>
<p>From the beginning of the CNAC's Shanghai-Guangdong route, there were plans to land in Hong Kong. However, due to the lack of British approval, it has not been realized until now. Later, the Ministry of Transportation consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British Ambassador to China for a long time. Now it has been approved by the British side.</p>
<p>Sino-British Joint Transportation</p>
<p>According to the company's manager, Mr. Dai Enji, yesterday morning, the British side has agreed to the company's planes landing in Hong Kong. However, the permit from the Hong Kong authorities has not yet been delivered. Now, after the Hong Kong side's permit arrives, the preparations for establishing a station can be carried out, as well as contacting the post office and BOAC. As for Sino-British joint transportation, because there is already a BOAC regular air route from Hong Kong to (Berang) (near Singapore), flying once a week, in the future, mail destined for Britain, after being transported to Hong Kong by CNAC, can be transported to Britain by BOAC planes.</p>
<p>Establishing a Station in Macau</p>
<p>As for the station on the American Pacific air route closest to China, United Airlines has determined it to be Macau, and has obtained permission from the Portuguese government. However, it has not yet officially started flying. It is heard that Mr. Bixby is now in Macau. Furthermore, United Airlines also plans to establish a station in Hong Kong. Negotiations are being conducted in New York, but nothing has been heard here.</p>

<h3>The Entire City's Labor Circles Host Banquet for Pan Gongzhan; Chairman Hopes Government Will Support Labor; Director Pan and Guests Give Speeches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union and all the city's labor unions held a banquet for Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan at the Atlantic Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at 7:00 PM on the 13th of this month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Guests and Hosts</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Lu Jingshi, Jiang Huaisuo, Mi Jifang, Xu Yefu, Wang Manyun, Lin Meiyan, Wu Hengru, Chen Junyi, Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Juxiang, Shao Xubai, Ye Xianggao, Long Yuting, Long Peiyun, Fan Yifeng, Shui Xiangyun, Li Mengnan, Lu Muqin, Hu Menglin, Yu Yaoqiu, Shi Jikuan, Li Hua, Liu Jintai, Ding Changyan, Shen Jiabin, Zhou Guangrong, Cao Zhimin, Bao Boyi, Zhang Dehua, as well as representatives from the cigarette rolling unions of the four districts, the water and electricity union of the first district, the match union of the fifth district, the postal service union, the postal worker union, the dried goods union, the rice cart union, the silk reeling union of the sixth district, the cotton spinning union of the tenth district, the military uniform union, the newspaper delivery union, the civilian ship union of the fourth district, the cosmetics union of the first district, the soap and pharmaceutical union of the ninth district, the candle industry union, the cleaning union of the first district, the tea making union of the sixth district, the sauce industry union, the hat making union of the fourth district, the cotton spinning union of the third district, the elevator driver union, the pharmaceutical union, the cotton spinning union of the fifth district, the towing and lightering union, the dyeing industry union, etc., more than one hundred people from over sixty labor unions attended.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's Speech</p>
<p>After several rounds of drinks, Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the General Labor Union, stood up to give a speech, which roughly stated: "Today, the labor circles of the entire city are hosting a banquet for Mr. Pan Gongzhan, director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, and have invited leaders of the party and government organs to accompany us. We are deeply honored and grateful for your willingness to come. On behalf of the labor circles, I would like to express my deep gratitude. Director Pan is a pillar of the party and the country, and his morality, writing, behavior, and character have long been admired by us. When Director Pan was in charge of the Shanghai Agricultural, Commercial, and Labor Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau in 1927, he achieved many successes in labor welfare and protection, from which the workers benefited greatly. After Mr. Wu Xingya's death, the central authorities still appointed Mr. Pan to succeed as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, which is not only a lucky star for our labor circles but also a blessing for all the citizens of Shanghai. The situation of labor in Shanghai is more depressed than before, and the workers themselves feel deeply pained. Shanghai workers should have a turning point during this period. Now that Mr. Pan has succeeded as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, I hope that he will provide more development and assistance to our labor in the future. On behalf of the comrades in the labor circles of the entire city, I have prepared a meager feast to wish Director Pan a boundless future in social undertakings."</p>
<p>Mr. Pan's Speech</p>
<p>After the chairman's speech, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan stood up and gave a speech, saying, "Gentlemen, leaders of the labor circles, I will sincerely accept what the chairman said. I hope that in the future, we can reach a broad and bright path step by step through difficulties. As the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau, my first certainty is that the labor circles of the entire city will help the government and cooperate fully. The second certainty is that we will follow the norms of the former Director Wu and solve all difficulties gradually. However, I still feel like I am facing a deep abyss and treading on thin ice with fear and trepidation. Now the country has entered an extraordinary period, and the future of the entire country and the entire nation is dangerous and uncertain. Recently, the internal unity of the party and the atmosphere of peace are spreading, and there is a new atmosphere of carrying on the past and opening up the future, which seems optimistic. But looking around, the enemy is watching and has ambitions to destroy our country and nation at any time. The Shanghai market environment is on the eve of extreme danger. All sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and education should temporarily put aside their own interests and prioritize the country and the nation, obey the central government, support the leader, and take unified steps to cope with the difficulties and absolutely avoid creating an unmanageable situation between classes. I hope that the leaders of all labor unions will always enlighten all workers to concentrate on organization, unify action, open up the difficulties of the country and the nation, and seek the great path of permanent survival." Afterwards, guests Xu Yefu, Shao Xubai, a member of the Standing Committee of the General Labor Union, and Liu Jintai, a representative of the labor union, gave speeches one after another. Drinks were exchanged, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy at about 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Abundant National Cotton Harvest Confirmed; Cotton Mills Starting Up; High Cotton Prices and Low Yarn Prices Will Change; Restoring the Original Market Situation of the Past</h3>
<p>After the estimated abundant harvest of domestic cotton is gradually confirmed, the situation of the cotton industry has improved somewhat. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency made a special trip to interview people in the cotton industry to inquire about the current and future situation of the cotton industry, as follows: There are many reasons for the depression of China's cotton industry in the past. The main reason was high cotton prices and low yarn prices. The reason for high cotton prices was the shortage of domestic cotton. The reason for low yarn prices was the poor situation in rural areas and the sluggish market for yarn and cloth. This situation is now gradually improving.</p>
<p>Domestic Cotton</p>
<p>This year is very good. The previous report from the Cotton Industry Statistics Conference reported that the output could reach 16 million dan. Recently, the Japanese cotton merchant Toyo Cotton Line also reported 14-15 million dan. It seems that it can always be calculated at over 14 million dan, which is more than enough to meet the demand. In the future, the price of cotton will not be more expensive than cotton yarn, which can be determined. As for the cotton yarn and cloth market, since the yarn factories have successively reduced production and stopped production last year, the output has been greatly reduced. In the past three or four months, the cotton yarn and cloth market has been very good, so the inventory of cotton yarn and cloth has decreased day by day. According to a recent survey, the current remaining cotton yarn in Shanghai is a total of more than 58,000 bales, which is more than 14,000 bales less than a month ago, and the decrease in Chinese factories is</p>
<p>The Most, a Decrease</p>
<p>Of more than 11,000 bales, which is due to the good sales of yarn in August. Now, the yarn produced by the Chinese yarn factories in Shanghai totals 54,000 bales, of which 28,000 bales are in the warehouses of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and only 16,000 bales are in the yarn factories, which is a very small number. In the past few days, the sales of yarn and cloth have been very good, and the yarn factories have sold a lot of futures for October, November, and December, so the number of yarn and cloth in stock will not increase in the next three or four months. This year, the agricultural products of various provinces have generally had bumper harvests, and there are not many areas of famine, so the sales of yarn and cloth have improved considerably. When new cotton comes on the market in the future, yarn factories</p>
<p>Will Gradually Start Work, and They Will Be Able to Sell Their Products Without Fear of Accumulation. It is not difficult to change from cheap yarn and expensive cotton to expensive yarn and cheap cotton. The time for the change is when the new cotton is successively put on the market. Recently, there has been a gradual trend in this direction. The prices quoted by the exchange show that cotton yarn is high in the near term and low in the long term, while cotton is low in the near term and high in the long term, which is clear evidence. However, the meaning of expensive yarn and cheap cotton is only in relation to the cheap yarn and expensive cotton of the past. It does not mean that cotton prices will fall alone or yarn prices will rise alone. Rather, yarn will rise more than cotton when they rise together, and yarn will fall less than cotton when they fall together. This direction is to restore the original market situation of the past and to bring the economic status of yarn and cotton above normal. As a result, yarn factories have become active, and many of the factories that have stopped work are preparing to start work.</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>Hengfeng has decided to start work and is now reorganizing. Shenxin Two Five and Zhenhua are also planning. The Zhensheng of Hankou has been taken over by the Changzhou Dacheng Yarn Factory. Hankou First is jointly operated by Hankou merchants and the Jiujiang Lizhong Yarn Factory. However, Minsheng has not yet made a decision because the machinery is relatively old. The Saicheng, Yuyuan, and Beiyang of Tianjin, which have stopped work, have also been bought by the Japanese and are rushing to reorganize and start the machines. At present, there are still 800,000 spindles in yarn factories that have stopped work. If all of them start work, they can use a lot more cotton, reducing the surplus of the bumper cotton harvest. In the future, expensive yarn and cheap cotton is expected to change slowly. Otherwise, the change will be as sudden as it was in 1924.</p>
<h3>Opinions of the Banking and Finance Industries on the Levy of Income Tax; Foreign Merchants Should Implement It Simultaneously to Avoid Capital Flight; Procedures are Insufficiently Prepared, Requesting Postponement; Decision to Send Representatives to Visit Relevant Officials to State Their Case</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance established the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office to handle the collection of income tax, the income tax of the second category "income from bonds and savings, that is, income from public bonds, company bonds, stocks, and interest on savings," was set at 5%, and the collection was set for October 1st. The Executive Committee of the Money Industry Association resolved to copy the income tax regulations and send them to all member money shops for study. If there are any opinions, please submit them to the association within one week for collection and handling. The Banking Association held an Executive Committee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 12th, and resolved to appoint three representatives to visit the officials in charge of income tax collection to state their opinions. Furthermore, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from the banking and finance industries yesterday. The details are described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Banking Sector</p>
<p>(1) Banks handle final accounts at the end of June and the end of December each year. Interest on various savings is settled at the time of the final accounts. Now that the income tax on savings interest is implemented on October 1st, the banks will inevitably have to handle the final accounts again at the end of September. Now that time is approaching, the procedures are insufficiently prepared, so it is hoped that the government will implement the income tax on savings interest on January 1st of next year at the same time as other taxes. The petition to the Ministry of Finance to review and seize the postponement of the event is currently being drafted and will be submitted in the next day or two. (2) For the income tax on interest on interbank savings, for example, if Bank A deposits a certain amount of money in Bank B, and Bank B deposits a certain amount of money in Bank A at the same time, it is requested that the income tax on the interest be handled in a flexible manner. (3) Foreign banks should simultaneously implement the collection of income tax on interest on savings, otherwise, there will inevitably be a risk of capital flight from Chinese banks. Please pay attention to this. Therefore, representatives will be sent to visit Gao Bingfang, the Director of the Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office, and Liang Hejun, the Deputy Director, to state their opinions and request adoption.</p>
<p>Finance Sector</p>
<p>Expressed agreement in principle with the collection of income tax on interest on savings and hopes that foreign banks will implement it simultaneously to avoid capital flight. However, how to collect it is considered to be in need of research, so letters are sent to various money shops to solicit opinions. It is decided that after the opinions of various money shops are collected, a meeting will be held to discuss them collectively. However, there is a deep fear that the implementation on October 1st will not be sufficiently prepared.</p>
<h3>This Year's Sales of Yarn and Cloth: Guangdong and Nanyang are the Best; Rice Harvest is Abundant and Yarn and Cloth Sales Suddenly Increase</h3>
<p>Rice Harvest is Abundant and Yarn and Cloth Sales Suddenly Increase. The Yarn and Cloth Industry Association of Maojia Lane in Nanshi reported that the sales of the association in the first half of the year were most prosperous in Guangdong and Nanyang. Afterwards, according to Mr. Zhu, the person in charge of the association, in an interview with a reporter from the Agricultural Village News Agency, "This year's rice harvest is quite abundant, so farmers' lives are still sustainable. This has greatly impacted the outlet for yarn and cloth."</p>
<h3>German and Polish Envoys: Doddmann Departs</h3>
<p>Mr. Doddmann, the German Ambassador to China, left Shanghai with his wife in June of this year to return to his country for debriefing and to take a short rest before returning to China to resume his duties. According to a reporter's inquiry at the German Consulate in this port, Mr. Doddmann has now completed his official duties and left Germany by boat yesterday, traveling to China via America. He will go ashore for a short stay in America and then set sail from America by boat to Shanghai, where he is expected to arrive on October 5th.</p>
<p>Wiedenbayer Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Wiedenbayer, the Polish Minister to China, went to Japan with his family in July to escape the summer heat. Now that the atmosphere is gradually cooling down, he took the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru from Kobe to China on the 13th. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon today. After Minister Wei arrives in Shanghai, he will immediately go to Nanjing to handle embassy affairs.</p>
<h3>Ship Losses</h3>
<p>Dongchuan Collides with Xuzhou</p>
<p>The Xuzhou, a ship of the China United Shipping Company of this port, has a deadweight of 1,658.15 tons, a registered tonnage of 926 tons, can load 2,400 tons of cargo, is 253.5 feet long, 35.9 feet wide, 17.8 feet deep, and has a draft of 16.6 feet. The ship currently sails on the Shanghai-Haizhou-Lianyungang route. This time, the ship went to Laoyao, Haizhou, to load coal. Yesterday, the shipowner sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai reporting that the Xuzhou was violently collided with by the large iron barge Dongchuan of Kangzhenji. The Xuzhou was unable to avoid it, resulting in the iron plates on the port side of the stern being completely broken, and a large hole was immediately created. The losses were enormous. The telegram was brief and the details are unknown. After receiving the report, the United Company, in addition to notifying the insurance company, urgently telegraphed Haizhou, ordering the Xuzhou shipowner to quickly report the cause of the collision in detail as soon as possible, so that a protest could be lodged.</p>
<p>Shihe Drops Anchor</p>
<p>The Shihe, a ship of the Gongji Shipping Company, has a capacity of 2,100 tons, a gross tonnage of 1,513 tons, a length of 232.2 feet, and a draft of 17.6 feet. The ship is currently transporting coal on the Yangtze River. Yesterday, Gongji received a report from the Shihe shipowner that the large iron anchor on the starboard side of the Shihe was suddenly lost and sank to the bottom of the river when the Shihe set sail from Hankou at 12:00 PM on the 12th.

<h3>Economic Commission Announces Prices of Autumn Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Production Volume Approximately 380,000 Dan; Manufacturers Depart to Purchase</h3>
<p>The autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will soon be on the market, and silk cocoon manufacturers have begun to depart to purchase them. The National Economic Commission has officially announced the standard prices for southern cocoons. The total output of autumn cocoons in the two provinces this year is 380,000 dan (market weight). The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Announced Prices</p>
<p>The Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission officially announced the standard prices for autumn cocoons: "It is hereby announced that the committee's ninth executive meeting discussed the issue of the standard prices for autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this term. After deliberation, it was decided that the price of raw silk per dan for the current autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang shall be set at 670 yuan in national currency, based on the average price of New York and Yokohama futures and spot prices. In addition, the wages for reeling are set at 80 yuan per dan, and the expenses for collecting and drying cocoons are set at 26 yuan. The cocoon ratio is 290 catties. The cocoon price is calculated according to the size of the cocoon ratio. For example, if the cocoon ratio is 460 catties, the price of fresh cocoons is 29 yuan per market dan. If the cocoon ratio is 430 catties, the cocoon price is 32 yuan. If the cocoon ratio is 500 catties, the cocoon price is 26 yuan," etc. This is hereby announced for general knowledge.</p>
<p>Deadline for Payment of Security Deposit</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Cocoon Control Committee issued an announcement to approve the amount of cocoon purchases by each merchant and set a deadline for the payment of security deposits: "It is hereby announced that the committee has handled the registration of silk cocoon merchants and the purchase of autumn cocoons in this province and has been closed on schedule. After review and determination, in addition to separately ordering and notifying the original registered merchants, the list of security deposits approved for each cocoon purchasing store is hereby publicly announced. The merchants concerned are requested to pay the above-mentioned security deposits in full at the Bank of China from now until the 17th of this month, obtain the bank's deposit receipt, and then go to the committee to exchange for a formal receipt. Do not delay. This is hereby announced." The approved manufacturers include (1) 18 silk factories in this province, such as Qingyun, (2) 39 silk factories from other provinces, such as Meifeng, and (3) 7 cocoon merchants, such as Baochang. However, the Qiaosi Cooperative, Zhuji Yongning Cooperative, and Haining Wangmiao Cooperative are exempt from paying security deposits.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Purchase</p>
<p>Fresh autumn cocoons will soon be on the market. The production volume in Jiangsu is 200,000 dan, and the production volume in Zhejiang is 180,000 dan (market weight). The price of autumn cocoons has been set by the Silk Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission, with reeling as the standard. The price is from 32 yuan to 26 yuan per dan, with 25 yuan as the central price. All cocoon firms have prepared to weigh them. Silk cocoon manufacturers in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and other places have registered with the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Committee and have now begun to pay security deposits to the Bank of China designated by the committee. The security deposit for each double stove is 100 yuan. After obtaining the bank's temporary receipt and returning to the committee to exchange for a formal receipt, they can go to the production area to collect cocoons. The deadline for paying the security deposit is set for the 17th of this month. If it is not paid by the deadline, the registration will be canceled. Therefore, all manufacturers are now paying the security deposit in full according to the registered amount of cocoons. Some silk cocoon manufacturers have seen new autumn cocoons on the market and have successfully borrowed money from the banking industry. In order to prepare as soon as possible, they have sent personnel to work with the bank representatives who borrowed the money to depart to purchase cocoons.</p>

<h3>New Cotton from Various Places Appears on the Market; First Batch of Nantong Cotton Arrives in Shanghai, Market Price Expected to Exceed 45 Yuan; Japanese Merchants Profit Greatly from Buying New Cotton</h3>
<p>According to a Shen Shi News Agency report, new cotton from various places has now appeared on the market successively. Except for a few areas where the harvest was poor due to the autumn rains, most areas reported abundant harvests. It is reported that the earliest new cotton from Yuyao, which has arrived in Shanghai, has reached about 17,000 bales. The first batch of new cotton from counties such as Nantong in northern Jiangsu also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling more than 20,000 bales. However, cotton purchased by various yarn factories in the producing areas has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. As for the price of new cotton, it is higher than that of old cotton due to the estimated reduction in U.S. cotton production, the soaring price of yarn, and the strong demand in various places. Market participants predict that the top-quality new cotton in the future may exceed 45 yuan per picul. As a result, transactions have been quite active recently, a situation not seen when new cotton entered the market in previous years. It is also reported that this year, Japanese merchants are buying new Chinese cotton by sending personnel to various places in advance to order futures, that is, setting prices and paying for orders in advance, and delivering goods in full when they enter the market, so they have made a lot of profit. Moreover, in addition to supplying their own factories, they also sell the spot cotton they collect to customers, so China has lost a lot from their transactions.</p>
<p>One transaction, a lot of loss. The 5th Anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident - The Whole City Flies Half-Mast Flags to Mark the Day of Shame</p>

<h3>Heavy Fog in the City Yesterday Morning; The Whole City Was Dark, Like Early Evening; A Sudden High Tide in the Huangpu River Last Night</h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency report, after the weather cleared up in this port, there was heavy fog again yesterday morning, and the darkness was like early evening. The tide in the Huangpu River was quite high in the afternoon. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Fog</p>
<p>The continuous autumn rains in this port made people feel quite uncomfortable. The sky began to clear up the afternoon before yesterday, and the weather became clear. However, yesterday at dawn, heavy fog suddenly arose, and the whole city was dark, like early evening. It did not dissipate until after 9:00 a.m. During the foggy period, shops opened and operated with electric lights, and streetcars moved slowly.</p>
<p>High Tide Last Night</p>
<p>The Huangpu River has been experiencing high tides for several days due to the autumn flood season. According to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau's forecast, the tide that occurred at 11:42 p.m. last night was quite large, with a predicted amount of 12 feet, 2.5 inches, less than one foot from the Bund embankment, so it deserves special attention. The tide started to rise after 9:00 p.m. last night. By 11:15 p.m., the tide was rising rapidly, and the water flow rate was approximately 2.0 nautical miles per hour. It began to recede at 2:20 a.m. today.</p>

More than 100 people attended. Chairman Cai Yuanpei and Yan Ganyuan gave speeches. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Successful Preview</p>
<p>More than 100 people from the cultural and artistic circles attended the preview held at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, including Cai Yuanpei, Liu Haisu, Yan Ganyuan, Li Dachao, Zheng Shixu, Shen Enfu, Ye Hongying, Xu Weinan, Jiang Hao, Wang Yuanbo, etc. More than 100 works are displayed in the Wang's art exhibition, all of which are landscapes from various places, mostly from Guangxi Province. There are ink paintings and oil paintings, a dazzling array of beautiful things, a major event in the art world.</p>
<p>Chairman Cai's Speech</p>
<p>At the preview tea party, Mr. Cai Yuanpei presided over the meeting and gave a speech, saying that Mr. Wang Jiyuan is a hard-working person, and all his works have a unique style and are extraordinary. In recent years, he has traveled around China and abroad, and has been to Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, as well as Japan, the Philippines, and other places. "Walking ten thousand miles and reading ten thousand books" has made Wang's paintings even richer.

Then, the elder Yan Ganyuan gave a speech, saying that Mr. Jiyuan's paintings have their own unique personality.

<h3>The Shanghai Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Various Wharves Complete Labor Tendering; Saving More Than 110,000 Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Merchant Steam Navigation Company's expenses are the highest for labor, reaching hundreds of thousands of yuan per year. This labor has always been handled by people who are not recruited by the bureau, so the rate is relatively high, and the leakage is more than tens of thousands of yuan every year. Therefore, since the reorganization of the bureau, the Ministry of Communications has attached great importance to labor expenses, and before starting to reorganize wharf affairs, it first reformed the labor item. It previously drafted rules and regulations and openly invited bids, which were handled by the bureau. After the advertisement was published in the newspaper, people from all parties who requested to bid to the bureau were very enthusiastic. It is now heard that the tendering of labor for the North, Central, South, New, and Hua wharves of the bureau has been completed. The completion of the bureau's labor tendering is the basic work for reorganizing wharf operations, and the significant reduction in labor expenses is undoubtedly the initial success in saving wharf expenses. According to the bureau's recent calculation, the labor expenditure of each wharf in the 24th year of the Republic was 205,846.53 yuan for the South Wharf, 26,182.62 yuan for the New Wharf, 53,754.36 yuan for the North Wharf, 39,265.61 yuan for the Central Wharf, and 10,108.57 yuan for the Hua Wharf, totaling 335,157.69 yuan. Now, the tendering results show that the labor rate has been reduced to 63.5% for the South Wharf, 50.5% for the New Wharf, 74.5% for the North Wharf, 74% for the Central Wharf, and 73% for the Hua Wharf. According to this rate, if the labor expenditure in the 24th year of the Republic is used as the standard for calculation, the South Wharf can save 75,133.98 yuan, the New Wharf can save 12,960.40 yuan, the North Wharf can save 13,707.36 yuan, the Central Wharf can save 10,209.06 yuan, and the Hua Wharf can save 2,729.31 yuan, totaling 114,740.11 yuan for the five wharves. This figure is only based on the bureau's business situation in the 24th year of the Republic. If the bureau's wharf business develops and cargo transportation increases in the future, the expenses saved will be more than this number. The bureau's reorganization keynotes are nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The revenue increase should start with the development of business, which has gradually shown a thriving trend. As for reducing expenditure, the effect of the labor tendering is the most significant.</p>
<h3>Believing in Evil Rumors; Fragrant Death; Boasting of Immortality, Using Talismans to Cure Diseases; Hoping to Cure the Disease, Borrowing Money to Recite Scriptures</h3>
<p>Jin, nicknamed "Hai Feng," of the second bao of Wanglou Township in Nanhui District, failed in business and was in a difficult situation. Recently, he came up with a strange idea and spread rumors, saying, "I am the incarnation of the Golden Light Bodhisattva from heaven, and I have been授与ed mantras and talismans that can cure strange diseases and ailments." Ma, a farmer's wife, had consumption disease, which had been lingering for many years and had no effect on medicine. Jin claimed to use talismans and secret formulas to ensure treatment, but she had to recite thousands of volumes of the Diamond Sutra, which he would handle on her behalf for a diagnosis fee of 18 yuan. Ma was eager to cure his wife's illness, so he borrowed money to entrust him with the treatment. However, after Jin's mysterious treatment, the disease became more serious, and he passed away the day before yesterday. Ma knew that he had been defrauded and had negotiated with Yu and wanted to recover his diagnosis fee.</p>
<h3>The Surveying Bureau Indicates the Location of Obstacles; A Total of Two Places; Navigation Attention</h3>

(2) Location: East coast of the Republic of China, date of discovery: the first day of this month, azimuth: 122 degrees 36 minutes east longitude, 29 degrees 24 minutes north latitude, description: a floating, unstable 10-foot black floating pile, with the letters W.C.B written on it.</p>
<h3>American Dental Expert Dr. Lin Ze's Speech</h3>
<p>Dr. Lin Ze, Dean of the Dental Hospital of West China University in Sichuan, is a famous American dental expert. He came to Shanghai on business the day before yesterday. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Dental Association and the Chinese Dental Medical Association specially jointly invited him to give a speech. The location was the assembly hall on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. The time was 8:00 p.m. last night. More than 200 people from the dental community and Russian dentists attended, including Xu Shaoming, Wang Lechu, Yan Dazhi, Lin Jianxian, Deng Fayen, Huang Rende, Yan Dasheng, Li Jingyuan, etc. Mao Zhixiang gave the introduction, Yan Dazhi recorded, and Xu Shaoming translated. The topic was "The Relationship between the Status of Dental Education and Business in China and the National Health Plan." The general idea was that the national health plan should pay more attention to the dental aspect, because teeth are an important tool for eating and nourishing materials, which is of great importance to the physical health of the people. Therefore, the popularity of dental medicine is the key to the health of the entire nation. He then said that dental development should have four types of talents: one is medical dentistry, the second is technical hygiene dentistry, the third is staff, and the fourth is nurses. Only by dividing labor and cooperating can it be completed satisfactorily. Therefore, the promotion of dental education is an urgent and essential task.</p>
<h3>Xing Zhigang Requests to Build a Nanhuiguan Wharf</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, a representative of the western shipping industry in Pudong, yesterday presented a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting the construction of a public wharf at Nanhuiguan, requesting that orders be given to the Engineering and Public Works Bureaus to plan and proceed with the construction in order to promote commerce. The petition stated, "Looking south from the Bund outside the Sixteenth Shop to the Dongjiadu Wharf, the wheel ports are densely packed and the warehouses are towering. The original wharves for civilian ships transporting goods from various ports have all been demolished and rented out as wheel port shorelines for profit. Therefore, civilian ships are crowded, and the one or two public wharves are difficult to dock. As a result, the goods of various merchants along the streets inside and outside the Nanshi area are difficult to load and unload, transportation is hindered, and commerce is scattered, which has a significant impact on the market. It is not a trivial matter... The Nanhuiguan Wharf is convenient for transportation. It is a gathering place for ships from various townships in Southern, Sichuan, and other counties... Since the Public Works and Engineering Bureaus considered this and set up a magnetic card to designate it as a public wharf, the wharf has not yet been built. Moreover, since the wharves for civilian ships at each port were merged, there are more and more ships coming, and if a public wharf is not rebuilt, merchants from the four townships will have no way to disembark, and transportation will be hindered. Those who have not been there in person cannot understand the suffering. The Shanghai Huangpu River Dredging Bureau has considered this and has repeatedly sent machine ships to dredge the area around the wharf for several days to avoid the shallow obstruction of ships. Now, because the wharf is narrow and blocked by wood rows, ships from the four townships still cannot dock and are in a desperate situation. Therefore, I venture to appeal to your honor to consider that the wharf is the lifeline of transportation, and transportation is the center of commerce. Please order the Public Works and Public Utilities Bureaus to build a public wharf at Nanhuiguan, according to the plan of the former Jian Gongyi Public Wharf, in order to benefit航旅 and engage in commerce, and I will be very grateful."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Meiji University Alumni Association Decides on Reorganization Methods</h3>
<p>The Meiji University Alumni Association in Shanghai, located at No. 115 Yuanpengyuan Road in this port, received a letter from the Meiji University Alumni Association in Nanjing discussing the matter of mutual merger.

<h3>The Sino-Japanese Joint Trademark Compilation Is Published</h3>
<p>The Trademark Compilation, which was started by the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry when the former director was in office, took three years to complete. It was entrusted by the bureau to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to be printed by the Zhonghua Book Company and is now published. Its content is divided into two major compilations: the Chinese section and the Japanese section. The book is 5 inches high, 6 inches wide, and 11 inches long, with a total of more than 2,500 pages. It is printed in fine detail on Daolin paper. All the trademarks used by industries and businesses in China and Japan are collected without omission. There are also more than 100 inscriptions by important figures from the National Government in the front of the book, which are undoubtedly valuable. It is truly an essential treasure for national industry and commerce associations, libraries, lawyers, accountants, and commercial artists. The actual price of the book is 15 yuan, and it is exclusively sold by the Stationery Department on the second floor of the Guohuo Shopping Mall of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. In order to popularize it, the association is temporarily selling it at half price, limited to 1,000 copies, and will not be lenient beyond the deadline.</p>
<h3>The Military Affairs Commission Awards Medals to Two Detectives; Everest and Ge Baohua Are Awarded by Commander Yang on Behalf of the Commission</h3>
<p>Since Yang Tiantian took over as the Commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, he has personally handled all matters, so the inside and outside are solemn. After the weekly memorial service for the Prime Minister last Monday, a ceremony was held to award Everest and Ge Baohua. Yang awarded the medals on behalf of the Military Affairs Commission. All officers and soldiers of the headquarters, as well as Ji Zhangjian, head of the Security General Regiment, and Cai Jingjun, head of the Public Security Bureau, participated. After the ceremony, Yang gave a speech, saying, "Everyone, today this commander represents the Military Affairs Commission and awards the medals to Mr. Everest, Western Detective of the Shanghai Public Concession Newsroom, and Ge Baohua, Chinese Detective. During this award ceremony, I would like to report on the achievements of the two awardees. Mr. Ai and Mr. Ge have served in the Public Concession Police Force for many years. They are diligent and capable, and are deeply trusted by their superiors. They usually assist the headquarters' reconnaissance team in searching for Communist Party members and eliminating rebels, which is undoubtedly helpful. A few years ago, the headquarters cracked the Communist Party's Lu Haifang case and the international Communist Party's Western criminal Walton and more than a dozen male and female criminals. The case was solved quickly, and few of the accomplices in the case escaped. Although the reconnaissance team of the headquarters was thoughtful, agile, and obedient, the assistance of Mr. Ai and Mr. Ge deserves to be commended. At the end of the case, the headquarters considered that the two gentlemen had made contributions to the party and the country, and specially requested the Military Affairs Commission to award Mr. Everest a second-class medal of the Lu Haikong Army and Mr. Ge Baohua a first-class medal of the Lu Haikong Army.

<h3>Members of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group Continue to Investigate the Case; All Six Are Not Allowed to Be Released on Bail</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Police Station of the Public Concession detained Liu Hantao (34 years old, from Sichuan), Fu Chaofu (30 years old, from Yiwu, Zhejiang), Yin Jiafu (43 years old, from Shangcheng, Henan), Wang Dongcai (31 years old, from Taixian, Shandong), Guan Yaoting (27 years old, from Nanjing), Dong Zhongzhang (46 years old, from Hangxian, Zhejiang, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Party and National Flag Sales Bureau), and Wang Tiemin, seven members of the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Group who threw bombs at various businesses in the concession to extort money. They were sent to the Special First Court for public prosecution. After Judge Qian Hongye's investigation, except for Dong Zhongzhang, who was declared not guilty, the other defendants were sentenced to imprisonment. Because the French Concession Police found that several bomb cases had also occurred in the concession, and it was feared that the defendants in this case were also related, on the 12th, they requested the Special Second Court to prepare a document and send detectives to the Special First Court to transfer Liu Hantao, Chuan Chaofu, Yin Jiafu, Wang Dongcai, Guan Yaoting, Dong Zhongzhang, and other six defendants to the French Police Station for questioning. The details have been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, the French Police Station transferred the defendants to the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court for questioning. The defendants separately retained three lawyers, Wu Peng, Fan Gang, and Wu Linkun, to defend them. Later, Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated the case, saying that the defendants were in a case of public danger and were arrested and prosecuted by the Public Concession Police and tried and sentenced to imprisonment. The French Police Department suspected that the defendants were also involved in similar cases in the French Concession and asked the Special First Court to bring them in. The case has not yet begun to be investigated. It is requested that they be detained and a period of two weeks be changed to investigate the case before prosecuting and interrogating them. After Chen Shuoying, a judge, inquired, he asked each defendant about their name, age, address, and occupation. Later, Dong Zhongzhang's defense lawyers Fan Gang and Wu Linkun said that Dong Zhongzhang was innocently implicated and had been detained for more than a month. His mother suffered a stroke because of this. However, there was no relationship in the case in the Public Concession, and he was declared not guilty. There was also no relationship with the case in the French Concession. It was requested that he be allowed to be released on bail. The other defendants were asked by the Lang lawyer to release them on bail. The court ordered that the hearing be postponed to September 28. The case of the defendants has not been investigated and cannot be released on bail. They are still being held in custody.</p>

<h3>Hua Dong Engraving Company's Liu Peiqing Accused of Forging Subsidiary Currency, Liu Fails to Appear in Court, Arrest Warrant Issued, Court Orders Temporary Suspension of Trial</h3>
<p>Lu Fangzheng, a doctor from Hubei, previously forged an authorization letter from Jia Shiyi, the manager of Hubei Provincial Bank, and commissioned Hua Dong Engraving Company at 25 Meibaige Road, Mao Yi Li, to print the bank's 50-cent subsidiary currency notes, totaling 50,000 yuan in face value. After the printing was completed, Lu boarded the Ruiyang Maru steamer on July 19 with the notes. Unexpectedly, they were confiscated by customs at Xiaguan, Nanjing. Lu took the opportunity to go ashore and flee, transiting through Jiujiang to Shanghai, intending to demand the return of the printing plates from the company. Liu Peiqing, the owner of Hua Dong Company, reported this to the police, who arrested Lu Fangzheng and handed him over to the First Special Court. During the trial, it was discovered that Liu Peiqing was also suspected of colluding in forging subsidiary currency, so he was ordered to be detained and handed over to the police for investigation. Later, the police found that Liu was not suspected, so he was not prosecuted, and Liu was released. Lu Fangzheng was interrogated, convicted, and sentenced to five years in prison. Now, the Hubei Provincial Bank, believing that Liu Peiqing, the owner of Hua Dong Engraving Company, was indeed colluding in forging subsidiary currency, collected various evidence and appointed Nan as its representative, hired a lawyer, and filed a self-accusation against Liu with the First Special Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xie-fen took the bench in the Third Criminal Court for interrogation. The defendant, Liu Peiqing, did not appear. The self-accusation agent lawyer stated the reasons for the prosecution and requested an arrest warrant because the defendant's whereabouts were unknown. The court approved the request and ordered the temporary suspension of the trial.</p>
<h3>Child Drowns in the River, Woman Commits Suicide, Truth May Be Hidden, Woman Rescued and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>At 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, a middle-aged woman was playing with a child in the Bund Park. In a flash, the child fell into the river and died. The woman also jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued by the Water Police and taken back for questioning. According to the woman, her name is Hu Ying, 32 years old, from Wenzhou. Her son, Wanyue (six years old), accidentally fell into the river and drowned while picking up things on the beach. She had no face to live, so she jumped into the river to die. Her husband is a small vendor in their hometown. She used to work at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Shanghai, but was laid off a month ago and is now staying in a hotel. She has a relative in Shanghai named Ying Rongsheng, who runs a sand-casting factory on Tongzhou Road in Hongkou. The head of the police believed that her statement was not entirely reliable and that there seemed to be something hidden that she could not tell. The dead child may have been pushed into the river, suggesting a suspicion of drowning the child and then committing suicide. Later, the child's body was recovered in the evening. Detective Hu Nongqing was assigned to investigate and summoned Yi Fuluo to identify the body, confirming that it was correct. Therefore, the woman's claim that her husband's surname was Hu was not true. The head of the police believed that the case urgently needed investigation, so yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., he ordered her to be sent to the District Court for disposition.</p>

<h3>National Labor Bureau Statistics, Total Number of Laborers in the Country, Totaling More Than 110 Million People, Without Unemployment, It Would Not Exceed</h3>
<p>According to the survey conducted by the National Labor Bureau, the number of male and female workers in China's industry, handicrafts (including occupations), miners, transportation workers (including aviation, railway, postal and telecommunications workers, and rickshaw pullers), and hired farmers (workers hired by small farmers), totals more than 110 million people, including unemployed workers. This accounts for more than a quarter of the total population of the country. If there is no unemployment panic and everyone can make the most of their talents, China would not be a backward producer and become an import-surplus country. Now, Cheng Haifeng, the director of the National Labor Bureau, has compiled an investigation report on the domestic labor situation and submitted it to the central competent authority for reference, so as to seek a comprehensive relief plan.</p>
<h3>Wusong Fishing Season Ends, Three Fish Firms Close Business, Or Consider Relocating, All Businesses Affected</h3>
<p>The Wusong fish market has a long history. Every year, the sales of yellow croaker and dried fish during the spring fishing season amount to about one million yuan. They have been jointly distributed by Cui Shengbao, Shen Tai (now Baofeng reorganized as Kaitai), and three fish firms. Most of the businesses in Songdi also rely on the fishing season as a prosperous period for business. After the opening of the fish market this year, the Wusong fish market has been subject to the regulations, because the dried and salted fish were not included at the beginning, so the three firms were still able to operate as usual. Now, the fishing season of the three fish firms has ended this year, and they have stopped business yesterday. Regarding the issue of joining the fish market as brokers, although the three firms have held repeated meetings, there has been no result. Some advocate relocating. From this point of view, the fish market in Songdi will not be possible to operate next year, and all businesses will inevitably be affected.</p>

This was actually a rumor. Although Mr. Ye Hongying is advanced in years, he is still very vigorous and healthy. The previous report might cause misunderstanding, so we hereby correct it.</p>

<h3>Zhang Guanghua Dies for Love by Jumping into River from Ferry – Han Village Owner Values Money Over Morality, Detains Courtesan in Attempt to Sell Her</h3>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, from Haining, 32 years old, worked in the stock exchange and was unmarried. This spring, he frequented the Han Village opened by Xu Axing at 142 Ailaige Road in the French Concession, where he met the prostitute Feng Qingying. They fell in love with each other and wished to be together forever. He discussed the matter with the village owner, and Zhang prepared 80 yuan to redeem Feng. After they lived together, Zhang's income was very meager and insufficient to cover the living expenses of the two, so Feng continued to stay in the village, selling herself and sharing the proceeds. Later, in April, it was heard that another girl in the village was being redeemed. Shan Feng acted as a guarantor for the transaction. The matter was discovered by the French Concession police, who considered buying and selling people as illegal. All those involved were arrested and investigated, and the case was closed. The village owner claimed to have spent 1,000 yuan on expenses, which should be borne by the buyer, seller, and guarantor. As a result, Feng was forced to pay 300 yuan, but she was unable to deliver it. Therefore, Zhang Guanghua wrote a promissory note for 300 yuan for the village owner to hold, and monthly interest had to be added. Unexpectedly, the village owner, Xu A, saw that it would be difficult to get the money back soon, and another client had taken a fancy to Feng, willing to pay a large sum to buy Feng as his wife. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, the village owner first pressured Zhang and Feng to repay the loan (i.e., the 300 yuan), but they could not. Then, Feng was detained, and she was forced to be sold. Zhang had redeemed her first, and the two were deeply in love, and Zhang could not bear to let her be taken away. He could not get Feng back, and, in extreme anger, became tired of life. At 8:00 PM the night before last, he boarded the Chunbei Line No. 16 city ferry at the Bund on Beijing Road to Pugu. When the ferry arrived at the Chunjiang Wharf, Zhang did not disembark but stayed on the boat to return to Puxi. The sailors did not pay attention to this strange passenger. When the ferry returned to the Beijing Road Wharf, Zhang suddenly jumped into the river to kill himself. Fortunately, he was rescued by the sailors and sent to the Maritime Customs Police Station. After hearing the whole story, the police chief ordered him to be sent to the local court for questioning the Han Village owner.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>– (Zhang Huang)</p>
<p>Even with mature teeth and holding a high position, one still feels immature, as if it were not long ago that one was playing around one's parents' knees. Having a good family, the words and deeds of one's own family, formerly treated with utmost reverence, gradually become annoying, and even one's own body is considered a superfluous burden.</p>
<p>A new daughter-in-law is not happy with her mother-in-law or with her husband’s younger siblings, because she is considered an outsider. The mother-in-law starts it, and the younger siblings follow suit, making things worse. The old father usually acts deaf and dumb because the money for marrying the daughter-in-law came from him, and he endures it for the sake of his money.</p>
<p>Parents invariably wish their children to be successful. If one son is unwilling, they urge his brothers to help, hoping that he will change. Spreading love leads to excessive expectations. Sisters-in-law and brothers-in-law argue reasonably, gradually becoming incompatible. Thus, peers become antagonistic, greatly hurting their parents' feelings!</p>
<h3>A Record of Revolutionary Elder Mr. You Lie</h3>
<p>– Qian Da</p>
<p>Mr. You Lie, who recently came to Shanghai, is truly a revolutionary elder. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was as famous as Sun Yat-sen, Chen Shaobai, and Yang Heling, known as the Four Heroes. He was one of the earliest founders of the Revive China Society. Later, when the society was reorganized into the Tongmenghui (United League), he led the alliance in the Nanyang region. Countless overseas Chinese were inspired by him to engage in revolution. The name "Republic of China" was determined by Mr. You Lie and Sun Yat-sen in Japan. After the Wuchang Uprising, Mr. You rushed to Yunnan to urge the southwestern provinces to revolt, and the whole country followed. After the establishment of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai tried to appease him with titles and honors, but Mr. You was unmoved. Instead, he organized the National Salvation Army to denounce Yuan's crimes. After Yuan's downfall, Mr. You retired to Hong Kong. In 1921, when Sun Yat-sen established his government in Guangzhou and took office as the Extraordinary President, he repeatedly sent envoys to invite Mr. You, but Mr. You firmly declined. Now, due to his advanced age, Hong Kong is not suitable for recuperation, and Speaker Sun of the Legislative Yuan happened to telegraph him to visit the north. Therefore, he took a boat to Shanghai with great interest, rested for a while, and will then travel to various places to enjoy himself. Mr. You is currently residing at No. 15 Jisi Fei Road, the residence of Mr. Tan Haiqiu. With the introduction of Mr. Tan and Mr. You's secretary, Ma Baimei, I once visited Mr. You at Qiupu. Mr. You said that he had suffered from storms on the journey and had not yet recovered his energy, so we did not talk much. Mr. Ma Baimei showed me a photo of five young men in their twenties. I have forgotten the surname of one of them, but the other four were Mr. You, Sun Yat-sen, Chen Shaobai, and Yang Heling. The photo was taken in 1888, more than thirty years ago. In these decades, how many changes have taken place in the world! And all of Mr. You's old friends from those years are now buried in the ground. I know that if Mr. You caresses this photo, he will surely feel a sense of沧桑(cāngsāng, vicissitudes).</p>
<h3>Yang the Comprador</h3>
<p>– Hua Ling</p>
<p>Yang the Comprador is the landlord of our lane. Because he used to work as a comprador in a foreign firm for more than 30 years, he is now retired and lives off the rent of more than 50 shikumen (stone-gated) houses in the lane, as well as some stock dividends. But everyone still calls him Yang the Comprador.</p>
<p>Yang the Comprador is already over 70 years old, but his desire for women is still as strong as when he was young. He lives in a specially built three-story house. The upstairs is occupied by his first wife, sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren, while the downstairs is occupied by his second wife, a once-famous courtesan, and a middle school student who has not graduated from a certain girls' school.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Yang the Comprador had an affair with a relatively unknown actress in a song and dance troupe and rented a house outside to keep her hidden. Last year, he met a radio announcer and got involved with her too. This year, he simply indulged in his old passions and frequented dance halls. He frequented dance halls, but he didn't dance. He knew that he was too old and weak to move around on the dance floor, so he always hired dance hostesses to sit with him. This won him the support of many dance hostesses, and finally, a 19-year-old dance hostess joined his group of stars.</p>
<p>Originally, he had one wife and two concubines. In the past three years, he has acquired three more, each living in a small villa outside, not connected to each other. This inevitably involved a lot of running around, and there was no one to take care of them. So recently, he evicted the tenants from the adjacent two-story house and moved the three new concubines together for convenience.</p>
<p>His friends, seeing him surrounded by such a large group of wives and concubines without any conflicts, admired his skillful methods and asked him for advice. He always laughed loudly, stroked his beard, and then replied in a methodical manner, "What's so rare about that? To be honest, they are like flowers, how could they love an old man like me? What they love is nothing but my banknotes. I give each of them what they want, and naturally all the other problems are easily solved."</p>
<p>According to him, "He has married one wife and fourteen concubines in his life. He can't even remember how many other informal relationships he has had. Most of his income in his life has been spent on this. Now that his income is decreasing, he doesn't dare to mess around so much."</p>
<p>Indeed, in recent years, it has been rumored that he has mortgaged the entire lane of houses.——But although his situation is not as good as before, he still marries a concubine every year.</p>
<h3>The Mated Phoenix</h3>
<p>– By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: The Stern Face Reveals Kind Words, the Parrot Hears Secrets – The Beautiful Eyebrows Hold Heroic Spirit, Asking about the Kunlun Pledge</p>
<p>Xiao Ju poured tea into the teacups on the table, not saying anything, just smiling. Menglan said, "Look at this girl, I don't know what valuable thing she has picked up that she keeps giggling about." Xiao Ju said, "Am I eavesdropping? I've been sitting by the railing for a long time. I only heard the two young ladies whispering and laughing, but I didn't hear what they were saying." She finished her explanation, put down the teapot, and walked out on her own. But she blocked the door, poked half of her head in, and looked at the two. And she looked at Youmei, pointed at Menglan several times with her index finger. Menglan laughed: "Go away, you little devil, what are you doing?" Xiao Ju flicked her tongue at them, and walked away. Youmei heard the sound of the stairs fading away, and said: "She's gone far away, you can tell me what you want to tell me now." Menglan stroked her chest, frowning and saying, "If I could tell you, I would have told you long ago, why would I need you to ask me again and again?" After saying this, she sighed softly. Youmei shook her hands and laughed: "I won't ask you anymore, I won't ask you anymore, don't get sick because of my questions." Menglan laughed. "Actually, I don't have the heart to talk to that one person specifically. You can send many words into my ears, but my heart will be paying attention to something else. So, whether I smile or sigh, the person sitting opposite me doesn't have to pay attention, my attitude has nothing to do with the person in front of me. I don't know why I'm like this. To say it in a trendy way, maybe I don't have a soul? Youmei, I'm very sorry, talking to a good friend like you, I don't listen properly. I'm afraid I've lost face in front of my old friend." Youmei laughed: "You don't have to apologize so much. Saying it like that, Miss, you are so pitiful. I can't help but shed a few tears with you!" Menglan said: "I don't want you to pity me. Wanting people to pity you is something that weak people do." Youmei laughed: "The more I talk to you in private, the more you complain. I won't say anything anymore, you rest well at home." As she spoke, she placed her hand on Menglan's shoulder and patted her lightly. Menglan said: "What's the matter? Are you leaving?" Youmei said: "I think you're distracted, you should rest well. If I'm here, you have to keep talking with me, which will tire your spirit." As she spoke, she took her hand, and walked towards the door. Menglan didn't try to keep her, she took her hand and led her to the doorway. Youmei walked down the stairs, and still showing half of her body, turned her head back and waved her hands at Menglan, Menglan smiled at her inexplicably, and did not say anything else. Youmei went downstairs, and Menglan, with some reluctance, stood leaning on the railing, looking down. Youmei stood in the courtyard, and sure enough, she turned her head back and laughed, "Don't be dazed, go to sleep properly." (74)</p>
<h3>The Art of Preserving Youthful Looks</h3>
<p>– Song Guobin</p>
<p>When friends ask me about the art of preserving youthful looks, I write this article to answer them. The text reads:</p>
<p>A guest asked me, "You are over forty years old, yet your complexion is rosy and full, your skin is full of blood, and you look like you are not even twenty. I am very puzzled! I have been your friend for twenty years! And you don't seem to age. If not, the black hair should be streaked with gray, and the smooth face should be wrinkled! Longevity and prolonged vision are the wild talks of immortals, and rejuvenating oneself is the innovation of scientific medicine. Therefore, there are beauty salons and ways to preserve youthful looks. You are a doctor, so do you have a so-called "secret art"? What is the technique? I hope you won't keep it a secret forever." I said, "Yes, yes, my technique is different from others. People's techniques seek to overcome nature with medicine and skills, while my technique is simply to follow nature. Confucius said, 'People are born upright, but bending them will result in good fortune and avoidance of calamity.' Birth, death, growth, and aging are the norm for people, but how many people in the world ignore the art of preserving life and distort their lives? When I was young, I was often sick, weak, and frail. The name of being thin was known to my relatives. Later, I studied in Shanghai, specializing in medicine, and gradually learned the way to preserve life. Therefore, my daily life, movement, and rest all have routines, and my diet and rest all have rules. For decades, I have remained the same. That is my first technique. I am naturally indifferent and forgetful about fame and fortune. I have no interest in officialdom and no desire for wealth. Although I do not have the lofty aspirations of Chu Kuang, I admire the meaning of Yan Hui's satisfaction and contentment. I consider self-sufficiency as wealth, desirelessness as nobility, tranquility as pleasure, and not being humiliated as honor. Therefore, I live in optimism throughout my life, and times of pessimism are always rare. That is my second technique. I have no addictions, only a love for reading. Sounds and sights are not for me, and I hate smoking and drinking. All habits that are harmful to the body are avoided. That is my third technique. Those who write and paint at night greatly damage their spirit, those who pursue fame and fortune laboriously endanger their lives, and those who indulge in sounds and sights cut down their nature with two axes. I secretly pity them. Therefore, the art of preserving youthful looks is to follow nature. My technique is neither strange nor unusual, just common sense. But people don't understand, and they want to use medicine and surgery to achieve the magical effect of immortality. Isn't that abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial?" The guest heard my words, seemed to understand, nodded slightly, sighed, bowed again, and left.</p>
<h3>Two More Poems Collected from Contemporary Talents</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Xiaodie sent a seven-character ancient poem from Japan, embedding the characters for this year (歲) and 元 (first) to participate in the International Hotel Spring Banquet, and using Mr. Chen's elegant name for harmony. It was published in this newspaper on August 25th. Now, knowing that the harmony poems of Mr. Xu Xiaochu and Mr. Zhou Bangshi of the new pharmaceutical industry have been completed, I will also follow the example of Mr. Chen Xiaodie, removing my own name and embedding the elegant names of other gentlemen, and I will record them below.</p>
<p>In the past, under the Jiao lonely tung tree, a Yaoqin song "Extend Pine" sounded, "Boyuan" sat as an old guest, and "Dachao" spoke of the fiery sky. The rooster reported that "Xiaochu" was silent, and the morning "Guangfu" shone through the window. With "Bangjun" a hero of both literature and martial arts, old "Gongzhan" could draw a six-stone bow. The young men were from good families, playing "Yuesheng" to attract phoenixes. Sailing together, "Jicheng" became sworn brothers, day by day engraving "Xinzhining" into the soup. With the beauty of "Yushu" as a maiden, who knows which is longer? The new folk friendship is thin as the clouds, and Miss "Xiaodie" comes with orchids and fragrance. The thread of "Yiping" is ten feet high, with "Shao Chuan" flowing into the sea. Drinking with "Xingyan" is only a little drunk, singing of "Xiaolin" with mountain streams and wind and moon. "Iron City" is quiet at night, with the sound of battle drums, and the lamp drags the drunken calligraphy column. Everything is a temporary lodging, and "Daosheng" magic is the way itself. Change the full blessing, "Shoulian" pearls are bright, "Yangchun" "Baixue" are difficult to harmonize. (Xu Xiaochu's harmony)</p>
<p>"Bai Xue" "Yangchun" music of great harmony, wonderful "Wen Qi" thoughts seize the work of heaven, crossing the "Jicheng" together to say goodbye to the "Moon," Shengpan Yasuong sings the ancient customs. Poet "Boyuan" sings white and harmonizes, may "Gongzhan" hear the lonely Tung tree. The child of the Ma family "Wuliang" lives in "Yiping," and peers are outstanding and enlightened "Shaochuan." The mighty river flows for thousands of miles, and the sand sinks. The "Iron City" opens the sleeplessness, who knows "Xiaochu." The first time I saw spring, "Guangfu" went upstairs, and early "Xingyan" frost curved around. The wine immortal fainted "Dachao" in the North Sea, and only "Xiaolin" hated the sea for being "small, Die." The dream wants to continue to startle, "XiaoJi" the rooster calls "Xingya" East "Folk, Yi" is originally on the same boat, sharing glory and disgrace, and no amount of "Daoban" can hurt the eyes. "Yu Shu" painting reveres the ancient country, and the gods of production compete to "seek the new." Many talents gather in Jiangnan poems, such as "Lanting Fangqi", four seasons of spring, and the age of "Yansong Zhi" is long, "Ji Yin Huan Huan" is the host and guest.

<h3>Rihui Port</h3>
<p>– Fang Pingfan</p>
<p>Rihui Port – a village not far from the city, yet completely different from it. Here, there are no tall Western-style houses, smooth asphalt roads, no enchanting jazz music, and no glittering neon lights. There are no girls at the forefront of fashion, no young masters living a bourgeois life... The so-called "port" has no huge warships or magnificent ocean liners, only tattered sampans strung together, floating from Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Here, you don't hear the calls of "Miss" or "Mister," or the kinds of sentiments like "I Love You" that assault your ears. Instead, you hear the cries of "Da Sanzi," "Gou Liuzi"... or "little bastard," "Damn you, you dare!" – all kinds of strange noises.</p>
<p>Aside from a few warehouses covered with sheet metal or tarpaulins on the banks, the rest are all thatched huts less than five feet tall. People live in these shanties like they are crawling, drawing water for washing and drinking from this muddy, yellowish river that contains an indescribable stench. "Hygiene" is, of course, out of the question!</p>
<p>The fragrance of cosmetics is even harder to smell! In hot weather, there's only the smell of laborers' sweat and the stench of rotting garbage baked by the sun.</p>
<p>An occasional chrome-colored Studebaker car passes by, the driver stepping on the gas pedal to go very fast, afraid that slowing down will cause the car to be tainted with filth. The ladies and gentlemen in the car press handkerchiefs tightly against their noses.</p>
<p>The nights are quiet, and the days aren't lively either. The strong men who live in these thatched huts go to pull rickshaws, the young ones carry baskets to work as garbage inspectors, and the women also have their own occupations – sewing skirts and catching lice.</p>
<p>In this lonely and desolate village, you can't go to Moganshan to escape the summer heat or see twin lotus blossoms at Qingyang Port. But sometimes, it gets a few artists who use this primitive type of slum as materials for paintings, putting it on the easel with light brushstrokes. But in their brushstrokes, there are golden thatched huts, a clear stream, small boats, and white geese – a whole picture full of poetic charm.</p>
<p>"Truly, the beautiful mind of a painter."</p>
<p>This is Rihui Port on the outskirts of the "Paris of the East!"</p>

<h3>All Proceeds from Qiu Fei Memorial Tournament Remitted to Qiu's Family Yesterday – Totaling 463.5 Yuan in National Currency, Xinhua Offers Free Remittance – Only Over Ten Yuan Received for Memorial Cup Donations to Date – Qiu's Family Still Overseas, Hu Xiansheng Appeals for Assistance</h3>
<p>Tennis elder Hu Xiansheng, saddened by the death of our national tennis player Qiu Feihai in a foreign land, mourned the demise of a national athlete and the drifting of the weak. He initiated the Qiu Feihai Memorial Tennis Tournament in order to raise funds to help Qiu's family. He received the sympathy of the Western Grassland Association of Wusong and the French Chamber of Commerce, and the tournament was held at the French Chamber of Commerce courts on the previous Saturday. It raised over 400 yuan. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. Later, Mr. Hu was unable to remit the funds because he did not know the address of Qiu's family. According to Mr. Hu, after days of inquiry, he obtained accurate information from Mr. Lin Baohua yesterday morning. Qiu's wife had sent a letter to Mr. Lin the day before, saying that she and her mother were still drifting in Penang and asked for assistance. Only then did he know the exact location of Qiu's family. Yesterday, all the proceeds from the tickets, minus the formal expenses incurred by the French Chamber of Commerce for the competition, were remitted by Xinhua Savings Bank to Qiu's family in Penang, totaling 463.5 yuan in national currency. Mr. Chen Bugao, manager of the Xinhua Xifayuan Branch, was very sympathetic and volunteered to help without charging any remittance fees. This also shows Mr. Chen's righteousness. The Qiu Feihai Memorial Cup Competition has been fundraising for a week since it started. Yesterday, this person (Hu referring to himself) specifically inquired at the Xinhua Bank on Xifayuan Road, the collection point for donations. However, only over ten yuan had been received to date. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will sympathize with Qiu's plight and contribute generously so that the annual memorial trophy can be held as scheduled, so as to commemorate a great figure in the tennis world, and the remaining funds can be remitted a second time to subsidize Qiu's family's future life and return expenses. According to reports, the Qiu Memorial Cup Competition was initiated by Mr. Hu Xiansheng. His plan is to use 250 yuan from the donations to make a silver cup, and the remainder will still be remitted to Qiu's family. The Memorial Cup will be managed by a committee organized by the National Sports Association. The competition will be held annually, and the winner will keep it for one year. Following the model of the 台杯(Taiwan Cup) method, the cup is engraved. In addition to Qiu's wife, Qiu's family also has an elderly mother in her seventies and a minor girl, all of whom are old and weak.</p>

<p>The Chinese Small Ball Association, organizer of the Sino-Association League Cup, held a total of eight fierce matches yesterday. In one match, the Kang team faced the Shanghai Eagle team, but the Shanghai Eagle team forfeited, giving the Kang team an easy win. (The Shanghai Eagle team has forfeited twice, and the association has revoked their qualification for the competition.) In another match between the Mubei Star team and the Weiguang team, an unfortunate incident occurred. In the first half, the Weiguang team scored two consecutive goals, leaving the North Star team scoreless, which inevitably led to rough play. After the Weiguang team scored another goal, several hundred spectators supporting the North Star team became inexplicably angry, and the atmosphere in the stadium became tense. Qin Zhirui, a player from the North Star team, eager to win, recklessly attacked and was blocked by Liang Bingyan of the Weiguang team. Qin then acted illegally, and the referee Zhang Zhixiang ordered him off the field. Qin Zhirui not only disobeyed the referee but also became very stubborn. Some spectators supporting the North Star team shouted to hit the referee and swarmed onto the field. After the spectators were ordered to leave, play resumed. Jin Minglai of the North Star team shot fiercely at Liang Bingyan's side. Liang was injured and fell to the ground and kicked at Jin. Several hundred spectators supporting the North Star team rushed onto the field and attacked. Liang Bingyan was severely beaten and humiliated and fled the field. Spectators chased after him, but Huang Yitian of the association stepped in to stop them. The North Star team, realizing they were in the wrong, held a meeting that evening at the Jinlan Restaurant and decided that the North Star team had violated the rules of small ball, and their membership was revoked. Liang Bingyan of the Weiguang team was also disqualified for overstepping the line.</p>

<h3>Accompanying the World Games Delegation (13th Letter) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen Sent by the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>The Battle of Norway and Poland</p>
<p>First half: Two to two</p>
<p>Second half: One to zero</p>
<p>Result: Three to two</p>
<p>Norway wins</p>
<p>The Norwegian and Polish teams, having been defeated by Italy and Austria respectively, competed at 4 p.m. on the 13th to determine third and fourth place. Over 100,000 spectators watched from the sidelines. The strength of the two teams can be described as evenly matched, each with its own strengths. Poland's front line is extremely sharp, with fast and accurate wingers, which are rare to see. However, their shooting technique is lacking, and they miss good opportunities at critical moments. The center and back lines are also very strong, saving many dangerous balls. The Norwegian team has average talent across the board, but they do not panic in the face of battle and have a strong fighting spirit, which is their distinguishing characteristic. Therefore, they were able to complete the victory in the final moments. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Norway: Holmboe, Bestad, Johoem, Sheng Flanchden, Najov, Martinsen, Sheng Ericson, Quanmen, Ulburg, Monsen</p>
<p>Poland: Da Tuo, Ke Aponski, Qie Lixisi, Sipongnik, Jie Bolage, Lage La Gao Te, Bert Locke, Man Nia Si, Hua Leqiang Referee: Birlem (Germany), Linesmen: Petere (Germany), Eglrew (Sweden)</p>
<p>Poland Takes the Lead. The bell rings four times, and the two teams in military uniform take the field, each occupying one side. They shoot, exercise, and loosen their muscles. The referee summons the captains to shake hands and make peace. The coin is tossed to determine position, and the war breaks out immediately. Poland makes the first move, and Jof refuses to accept the invitation. Martinsen gets the ball and advances, and Jie Bolage also clings on. You come and I go, all in vain, wasting their efforts. At ten minutes, Poland sneaks in from the right. Hua Leqiang wants to make a fancy play, but Holmboe is actually stumped. He passes the ball to the center with one kick. Man Tuo Yasi's foot steps on it. Ling Mussen steps forward to grab it. Man Tuo Yasi hooks it back. Hua Da Si rushes up and shoots fiercely. Jona Sheng has no way to save it. The Polish team opens the scoring first. The four seats shout in unison, shaking the earth. The Polish team is not satisfied and continues to invade, killing the Norwegian team so that they only have the power to parry and no power to fight back. At thirteen minutes, Gao Te raises the banner of righteousness in front of the goal. Holm Sheng is forced to do nothing but make it a corner kick. Hua Leqiang kicks it in just right. Jona Sheng has to lift it upwards, over the crossbar. Hua Leqiang kicks another corner kick. Eric Sheng shouts loudly, rushes forward to block it. Bert Locke intercepts it and aims at the goal, shooting fiercely. Jona Sheng bends over to welcome the guests, catching it head-on. However, the momentum is too strong, and he slips to the ground. Fortunately, he is agile and immediately picks it up and kicks it out. The Norwegian forwards are not useless. At twenty-five minutes, they receive support from the defenders. With a command, they have already swarmed to the Polish city. Martinsen initially fires a heavy cannon, but it fails to blossom. Seeing the left side empty, he lightly passes it out. Bestad rushes up and kicks it, directly into the upper right corner. Aponski cannot resist. One to one, the score is tied. The Norwegian team has won the first battle, and the front-line soldiers are even more active. Six minutes later, they pass forward and point their spears directly at the goal. Bestad receives support from Martinsen and shoots again on the left side, breaking the net. The two goals before and after are played the same way. Two to one, Norway comes from behind. The Polish army is enraged and retaliates. Three minutes later, Hua Da Si dribbles forward, directly to the Norwegian goal. Just as he is about to raise his foot to shoot, he suddenly slips and falls. Hua Da Si is quick-witted and takes advantage of the situation. Bert Locke flies up and catches up. Foot up, ball down. Two to two, another tie. From then on, the situation becomes increasingly tense. Although both sides have repeated turbulence, they do not lose an inch of land. The first half ends, and everyone is in a good mood.</p>
<p>Norway Wins in the End</p>
<p>After the break, the Norwegian army's momentum suddenly surges, and their brilliance is revealed. At eight minutes, the central army, led by Ma Liao Sheng, penetrates deep, passes several times, and then fires a direct shot, sharp and powerful. Unfortunately, it hits the goalpost and bounces out, and his ambitions are not fulfilled. The Polish team counterattacks, and Gao Te also makes a wild shot. After that, Norway had three shooting opportunities. The first time, the center forward was Ding Sheng, who kicked hard from ten yards in front of the goal, but it flew into the sky. The second time, Martinsen again got the ball from the upper yards in front of the goal, with no obstruction in front, but he launched it a little late and was rescued by Sipongnik. The third time, Martinsen again swept the ball on the ground in front of the goal, but it was caught by Aponski. Conversely, the Polish side also had several chances to win, but they all missed the opportunity and failed to achieve anything. In a fierce battle, it was thought that extra time would be needed to determine the winner. Who knew that one bell before the end, Norway sneaked in from the right. The Polish right back, Qie Lixisi, stepped forward to grab it and slipped. Monsen quickly passed it to Martinsen. Martinsen deliberately made a gap. Hua Da Si rushed up and kicked hard, sharp and powerful. Aponski jumped up to block it, but the ball still bounced into the goalpost. Although Poland's ambition did not die, after two or three passes, the whistle blew long, and Norway won the final victory by three to two. (End of letter 12)</p>

<h3>Sino-British Gengkuan Board Plans to Develop Education in the Northwest; Mei Yibao and Others Go to Lanzhou for Inspection</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Air Express, In order to develop education in the Northwest, the Sino-British Gengkuan Board has specially allocated 200,000 yuan from the educational and cultural undertakings subsidy fund for the 25th year to subsidize primary and secondary school education in the four provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Suiyuan. The detailed measures must be determined concretely after sending personnel to the west for investigation. Therefore, Dai Liren, a British national who is a director of the Sino-British Gengkuan Board and a professor at Yanjing University, Mei Yibao, the academic dean of Yanjing University, Guo Youshou, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Education, and assistants Li Mengying and Bai Baojin were organized into the Northwest Education Inspection Group of the Sino-British Gengkuan Board to conduct on-the-spot inspections in the Northwest. Li and Bai had already arrived in Lanzhou from Shaanxi a few days ago. Mei and his party of three flew from Ningxia to this question at noon on the 9th and stayed at the Lanzhou Lizhi Branch. According to Mei's conversation with the reporter, the Sino-British Gengkuan Board, in order to have a solid basis when distributing the four northwestern educational funds, has organized this group. They departed from Peiping to Suiyuan, inspected for two weeks, and have a preliminary understanding of the current educational situation in the province and the social needs for education. Although the inspection in Ningxia lasted only one week, they thoroughly investigated all important areas. The purpose of coming to Lanzhou is, of course, to focus on educational inspections, but it is also necessary to attach importance to the social economy and people's livelihood that are related to education, so as to serve as a reference for future distribution of collaborative funds. The original date was set for two weeks, and the event will immediately go to Qinghai. At the moment, everything related has not been discussed with Chairman Yu and Director Tian, so it is still undecided how many days are needed in Gansu and whether they will be able to go to Qinghai in the future.

<h3>Faculty and Staff of Various European and American Countries Invited by Higher Education in Our Country</h3>
<p>The number of foreign teachers employed by colleges and universities across the country has been noted in previous reports. Here are the statistics from the Ministry of Education on the nationality and number of foreign faculty and staff in colleges and universities across the country in the 23rd year. (Note) The reporter checked the Ministry of Education's statistics of 704 faculty and staff members, of which only 157 were from national and provincial schools, while 542 were from private schools, more than three times the number of national and provincial schools. Moreover, most of the teachers in national and provincial schools are engineers and technical teachers, while many private schools have teachers who teach general academic subjects. This is because such schools are mostly related to churches and cannot, like public schools, only use foreign nationals when they are lacking in technicians.</p>
<h3>Measures to Increase Funding for Free Education in Various County-level Cities in Zhejiang Province: Discretionary Income from Autonomous Surcharges</h3>
<p>The self-raised funding for free education in each county-level city in Zhejiang Province in the previous year lacked reliable methods, which inevitably affected the progress of the undertaking. This year, it is planned to increase revenue from the autonomous household donations in each county-level city to ensure a definite and consistent source of funding for free education. The specific measures are as follows: (1) The funding for implementing short-term compulsory education in each county-level city, starting from the 25th year, should be collected together with the autonomous surcharges. (2) For county-level cities where autonomous surcharges have already been approved, the amount should be increased by 10% to 35% of the autonomous household donations, taking into account actual needs. The percentage should be reported to the three bureaus of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Education for approval on a case-by-case basis. (3) For county-level cities where autonomous surcharges are being submitted for approval or have not been approved, the three bureaus of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Education will consider the actual needs of each county-level city and approve the increase percentage on a case-by-case basis. In addition, each county-level city may, with approval, allocate funds from (1) late payment penalties for field tax county tax, (2) slaughter surcharges, and (3) collection of old taxes belonging to the county tax portion, and instruct them to be implemented separately.</p>

The public announcement is recorded as follows: "We hereby respectfully announce that Mr. Zhang Taiyan of Yuhang, with his extraordinary talent, was in a position of obscurity. In the early years of turmoil, his dragon-like virtue was hidden. He retired to write books and lecture, presiding over the atmosphere for over forty years. This summer in June, he passed away in Suzhou. The court and the countryside, far and near, rushed to mourn, because the existence and death of this person is of great importance to the national scholarship of China, not just a private concern of one time and one place. We and other colleagues had long admired his righteousness and had either participated in the last seats of the allusions or entrusted ourselves to the slight contract of private learning. Mountains and rivers obstruct the funeral, so we can only hold a memorial service at Zhigongtang, Sichuan University in Chengdu on September 27th. All of us countrymen, who share the same spirit, feel grief for the death of a person and the decline of the country. It is hoped that we can mourn the division of Taoism and the withering of the philosopher, and that we can come together to express our condolences, so that we can believe that our Tao is not alone and that we can rise up and inherit our noble virtues. This is what we aspire to. We respectfully announce, and hope you will understand."</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds See Slight Swaps by Bulls</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market remained stagnant. For several weeks, it has hovered without deviating from its original path. The lackluster market conditions are annoying. There have been no changes in the environment. Only retail investors engaged in slight swap transactions in the market. Therefore, market prices have not been able to rally, and trading has not been easy to increase. Yesterday, during the two sessions in the morning, the bulls slightly engaged in swaps, and market prices slightly weakened, but the range was only 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, trading was light. The opening was slightly better by 0.05 yuan, and the closing may be slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. With such repeated spins, trading volume for this month has invisibly decreased significantly. Therefore, the prospects may not necessarily have a crushing wind. The market price results, except for the current month's 96, which uniquely rose by 0.05 yuan, the rest all decreased slightly by 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. The total volume traded was 3.37 million yuan. The results of the price changes are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Sales Are Strong, but Standard Yarn Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline due to the calm situation in overseas yarn and cotton markets. However, spot yarn sales are increasingly good. Southern interest in importing is strong, and demand for coarse yarn is even stronger. Therefore, some are inclined to buy when prices are low. However, foreign merchants are thinking bearish and general non-industry speculators are selling heavily, putting pressure on the market.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Fell by About One Yuan</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened with a stagnant and mediocre feel across all months. However, trading in the market was very light. Except for the current month, which remained unchanged, distant months fell by 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. The second session continued to fall by 0.3 and 0.4 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the third session, it was heard that southern interest in spot yarn was very strong, and coarse yarn sales were even stronger. Sentiment was revived, and distant months jumped up by 0.7, 0.8 yuan to 1.2 yuan. However, Changfeng, Dazi, and Runkang saw a surge in selling. By the time of the close, it had returned to a small number of cents. However, Deda and Yuda covered their short positions in larger quantities. The standard yarn results saw near months fall by 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day's close, and distant months rose by 0.2 and 0.3 yuan. The afternoon opening saw the current month rise back, but the distant months were mediocre. After the second session, retail investors gradually sold, and the market fell. In the end, each month fell by 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 yuan compared to the morning close. It was noted that 1,400 bales of Dafu, 1,000 bales of Huamao, 5,600 bales of Changfeng, 1,500 bales of Runkang, 1,750 bales of Shengyuan, 1,800 bales of Tongji, 1,200 bales of Yuda, 3,450 bales of Senkang, and 1,000 bales of Dachang were sold. 800 bales of Tonghe, 1,950 bales of Deda, 1,400 bales of Dafeng, 1,400 bales of Gengfeng, 1,300 bales of Wangtaixing, 900 bales of Yiguan, 1,300 bales of Xiecheng, and 700 bales of Taichang were bought. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Have 1,600 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still considered not bad. It was noted that a total of 1,600 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. Selling prices were stable. The purchase amounts of each gang are listed below: Guangdong 890, mainland 160, Changsha 20, Shantou 60, Tianjin 340, fellow traders 30.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Are Already Rushing to Secure New Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then weakened, gradually showing a revolving state. The reason is that foreign cotton is stable, Indian cotton is very firm, and manufacturers are rushing to secure new spot cotton, tightening the market. However, this year is a year of abundant harvests, and general non-industry speculators are inclined to sell. Changhe's selling pressure is very intense, but there was some buying back in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Rises and Then Retreats</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, with the weather being good. The previous day, large players had sold off heavily, the trading floor was loose and flooded, and the market was dull and lifeless, falling by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Until the distant months stabilized, the second session was flat, and the distant terms rose. Market observers said that although American cotton was flat, Indian cotton rose sharply by 2 to 3.75 rupees. The Osaka Sanpin cotton market was quiet. Arrivals at the wharf were not strong. Various factories were again rushing to secure new crops. The Yao cotton and Tongzhou prices were shouted up by 1 yuan. As a result, the market atmosphere tightened suddenly, and the buying trend was intense. Each month jumped by 0.2 and 0.3 yuan, but Changhe still came with a large amount of selling. Hexing, Huamao, and Dachang also sold heavily. The closing price returned to small gains. However, Dafu, Mingde, Dachangcheng, Runkang, Fukang, Jinkang, Yuanxingchang, and Yongchang added to their long positions, and shorts covered their positions. Both sides rose together. As a result, the standard cotton prices for each month rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening saw a change in the weather. Buying interest was still strong. Following that, the yarn market was flat and lacking vitality, and the weather turned better, leading to a decline. As a result, each month fell back by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan compared to the morning close. It was noted that 3,800 dan of Changhe, 2,400 dan of Zhenda, 2,500 dan of Senkang, 2,200 dan of Xinchang, 3,200 dan of Dachang, 3,600 dan of Huamao, and 3,000 dan of Hexing and 3,500 dan of Fukang were sold. 2,500 dan of Yichang, 1,200 dan of Dafu, 2,100 dan of Mingde, 2,000 dan of Dachangcheng, 2,400 dan of Changfeng, 5,900 dan of Runkang, 2,100 dan of Yongchang, 3,300 dan of Yuanxingchang, and 2,300 dan of Renfeng were bought. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The First Batch of New Tonghua Cotton Arrives at 50 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, but the high price makes factories unhappy. The first batch of 68 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived, with bright color and a price of 50 yuan, and was purchased by Zhongxin Factory. 1,600 bales of Yao cotton arrived with a price of 34.9 yuan, up 0.2 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>A Surge in New Cotton from Hankou; Transactions Are Also Active</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: The cotton market in this port, due to the abundant harvests this year, sees a surge in sources from various regions. However, the inspection standards have been raised, and many are unqualified due to excessive moisture and are discarded outside the market, failing to be listed for sale. On the sales front, various yarn factories, with depleted inventories of old cotton, are eagerly awaiting new cotton, and there is more purchasing of new cotton. It is claimed that exporters are also rushing to secure supplies, and Japanese firms are sending people to search in rural production areas. Therefore, the market situation is still lively, and prices have risen by several jiao. Today, Yuhua, Shenxin, and other yarn factories purchased a total of 1,815 bales, equivalent to 997 dan and 90 jin in the city scale. The details of spot cotton transactions are excerpted below.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Transactions Are Quite Active</h3>
<p>Last week, American cotton rose sharply. Buyers in Mumbai did not follow American cotton at its peak. Transactions in Omra and Pingguoer were active, mostly done by major players shipping to Japan. Mainland interest in Indian cotton is very weak. Lancashire's needs are limited to Karachi new cotton. Rainy weather during the week was more favorable, and both Bairoxi and Gujula received widespread beneficial rain, resulting in improved cotton harvests. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Market Was Slightly Smaller</h3>
<p>Osaka dispatch on the 14th: Sanpin cotton futures fell 0.155 yuan, with the near month at 66 yuan and the distant month at 64 yuan. Yarn futures fell 0.5 to 1.6 yuan, with the near month at 214.2 yuan and the distant month at 203 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Are Still Strong in the North and South; Spot Goods Are Still Very Scarce; Colored Cloth Sales Are the Most Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was stable. Although the yarn and cotton market showed a slight slackening, cotton cloth was lacking in spot supply. Various regions urged orders to be placed urgently, and the Tianjin and Guangdong gangs in the north and south suddenly surged to purchase. Various factories have found it difficult to cope. If Yunnan and Guizhou also see increased sales, various goods will become even scarcer. Therefore, manufacturers are very calm. Yesterday, Eastern standard fine cloth grey cloth declined slightly by 0.025 yuan per piece, due to the influence of yarn and cotton and the still stagnant demand from dyeing factories. Patterned goods, printed satin, straight tribute, and serge sales were very active, especially in Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi. Various factories shipped dozens of boxes of new patterns, which were sold out as soon as they arrived. Flannel goods such as printed flannel, white flannel, colored striped flannel, and white French flannel, with the weather gradually cooling down, are in increasing demand from various regions. The output of various factories is increasing daily, and the market is flat. The inventory of lightweight coarse cloth from the British Ewo factory is decreasing daily. The market demand is increasing, and it is quite tight. The output of lightweight and heavyweight coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill from various Chinese factories has greatly decreased, because the demand for colored goods is surprisingly strong, so the weaving of grey cloth has been changed. The most active buyers yesterday were the inland gangs and the gangs from Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi.</p>
<h3>Woolens and Fabrics Are in Season with the Autumn Cool</h3>
<p>Recently, autumn has arrived and the weather is gradually cooling down. Various woolens and fabrics are selling well in a timely manner. The Ronggang from this street continues to add inventory significantly. Large quantities of Chinese and Western clothing, men's and women's colored thick and thin woolen fabrics are being shipped daily. Yesterday, herringbone, melton, flat thick, medium thick serge, and new brightly colored goods were more popular, and sales were brisk. Standard market prices were firm and rising. Yesterday, ordinary brand melton was selling for 2.45 yuan per yard wholesale, Baoda herringbone for 2.25 yuan, Ruiwen goods for 4.75 yuan, Baoda flat thick for 2.6 yuan, Huabo No. 1080 for 2.7 yuan, Lianhuan medium thick serge with a picture for 5.25 yuan, and Lianhuan No. 220 dark colored high striped fabric for 5.5 yuan, and No. 85 for 5 yuan net price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Future of the Silk Market May Become Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in this port was very firm. Although Yokohama silk prices continued to rise (spot rose by 5 yuan, futures rose by 8 yuan), foreign firms in the silk market were still taking a wait-and-see approach. Only Jardine Matheson and Banque de l'Indochine made a few purchases. The market was largely unchanged. User prices also did not fluctuate. However, because silk merchants were holding prices firmly, there were few buyers, so transactions were very scarce. For example, yesterday, a certain silk factory opened a price of 615 yuan for white factory B-grade 20/22 filaments. Although interest in bulk purchases was significant, no one sold. Observing the current silk market, sellers seem unwilling to compromise again, and buyers also seem unable to complete transactions at high prices, so the current domestic and foreign silk sales seem to be tending towards a deadlock again.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Sees Some Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Qimen black tea saw some movement. Jinyin and Nianmazhi and other firms all made some purchases. The top grade sold for 61 yuan. It is heard that Jardine Matheson, Concord and other firms, in view of the favorable current market tea prices, sent out many telegrams, and the market is brewing for progress. Green tea transactions were still light. Only British companies such as Banque de l'Indochine and Baochang showed some interest in high quality Zhenmei with good leaf bottoms. Low grade substandard goods were selling very slowly. There were significant differences in sales volume.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Merchants Association report, the green tea market, because there are few arrivals and the inventory is not thick, and there are few high-quality new teas, various firms are presenting a lax attitude. The attempt to sell to foreign countries has mostly failed, resulting in an unusually quiet market. Yesterday, only Xiehe purchased more than 70 boxes of Tunxi Xiaozhenmei, priced at 42 yuan, and Huatu purchased dozens of extractions of Zhenmei, priced from 80 to 105 yuan. Transactions in other Zhenmei, Gongxi, and Pingshui teas were extremely light.</p>
<h3>August Raw Silk Export Report: Exports Decreased Sharply... Market Conditions Were Weak</h3>
<p>According to the report from the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industries, in August, the export of Chinese silk to the Americas was 1,300 bales, to Europe 1,490 bales, to Africa 321 bales, and to Asia 193 bales. By category, the export of white factory silk was 2,637 bales, Tussah and White Soil silk 200 bales, Yellow Factory silk 5 bales, Yellow Warp and Yellow Soil silk 276 bales, Gray Warp 64 bales, and Douppion silk 122 bales. In addition, the export of waste silk was 2,926 bales. Since the new silk season began this year (starting in June), the total export of Chinese silk in three months was 16,090 bales, a decrease of 5,670 bales compared to 21,760 bales in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The silk market was initially stable in August, but then became weak due to sluggish foreign sales. Silk prices therefore fell frequently. For several months, the domestic silk market has been affected by the fluctuating markets in New York and Yokohama, with foreign cables consistently differing from domestic market prices by a huge 30-50 yuan, causing the market atmosphere to often be deadlocked. Fortunately, domestic sales were still active, and general sentiment was unusually enthusiastic. Although sales from foreign firms were not strong, market prices were still able to hold steady, and the foundation seemed quite stable. Entering August, foreign firms continued to present a deadlocked situation, causing general sentiment to worry about the future. In addition, this month was the period for the settlement of large commodity futures, and actual sales from foreign firms remained stagnant, with long positions crowded in the market, and the market atmosphere became increasingly sluggish. However, according to general observation, if European and American sales can be activated, there is hope that the market will recover.</p>
<p>Statistics on the quantity of Chinese silk exported in August (unit: bales).</p>
<h3>Metals: Japanese Metals Competing with Europe and America; Over 10,000 Dans Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ikoma Maru arrived from Osaka yesterday carrying metal products totaling over 10,000 dans, unloaded at the Mitsubishi Company wharf, including 2,000 bundles of three-foot, six-foot, and three- to ten-sheet black iron sheets, 650 boxes of white iron sheets, 1,200 pieces of new lead wire, 2,000 sheets of thin steel plates, 450 pieces of foreign ingot iron, 1,800 bars of angle iron, and over 400 pieces each of round nails and garden lead wire. Except for the white iron sheets, which are American products transshipped from Japan, all other metals are products of Japanese factories such as Osaka, Yawata, and Zhongshan. Japanese merchants believe that various goods have the potential to surpass Europe and America, but only metals are dominated by Europe and America. Therefore, they are determined to compete in China. More metal products will be shipped in the future, and it is feared that the goods of European and American countries will be hit hard.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Seems Unlikely to Fall Further</h3>
<p>After falling sharply, white tung oil has been in a slump. In recent months, the Hankou market has hovered between 55 and 56 yuan per dan, which is very stable. Although it once rose to 62 yuan, it was only a flash in the pan. In recent days, the market has become increasingly quiet. According to letters from Hankou, various foreign firms are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even if there are transactions, they are only a few dozen tons, which is not enough to excite the market. However, the price has fallen so low, so even if there are no transactions for a long time, it is unlikely to fall further. Moreover, the inventory in various producing areas is thin, and there are still two months before the new crop arrives, so holders are probably not eager to sell. According to observations of the current market, it seems to have entered a state where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Black Melon Seeds Are in Short Supply and Continue to Rise; The First Batch of New Quanzhou Round Arrived with Over 2,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>Due to the autumn floods this year, the black melon seed crop is in short supply, and the output has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the production price in Xuzhou has repeatedly risen, increasing by about 14 yuan. According to a quick letter from Dacheng, the goods arriving these days are extremely scarce. It is found that the total production has already decreased by 70-80%, and the stocks held by households are also limited. The market has great hope for a major rise. According to industry insiders, it seems that 10 yuan per guan for Xukui seeds can be reached. Also, according to a dispatch from Mingguang, Linhaiguan, the small-style melon seeds there have also risen by nearly one yuan. The prices here are gradually rising. For example, in addition to Zhuangzi's opening at over 11 yuan, the rest are firm and sellers are reluctant to sell.</p>
<p>The first batch of new Quanzhou large bubble balls has already been transported by the Yongcheng Ship with more than 2,000 pieces. Among them, the large-style goods are said to cost up to 40 yuan. Samples will probably be available tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The opening trend is loose due to a sharp increase in arrivals.</p>
<h3>Grains: Actual Sales: The State of the Recent Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for various months initially appeared stable and then loose and declining. The prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada were slightly better by 0.048 to 0.1 yuan. However, market sentiment was due to the current sluggish sales, and the inventory of various factories was gradually increasing. Under this environment, even if they had strength, they could not stubbornly resist. Therefore, although the opening price was stable, it gradually loosened, falling by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to the previous week's close. Until the opening in the afternoon, the market atmosphere for various months was still lifeless. Because factories were aware that the sales channel was not active, they gradually sold off their samples, so sentiment gradually softened. However, domestic factories slightly covered their short positions, slightly supporting the market. Industry insiders speculate that because sales are consistently stagnant, the recent flour market is likely to decline.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fell Again by 0.07 to 0.08 Yuan Due to Sluggish Flour Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was calm in the morning. Foreign wheat prices were slightly better, and there was little selling in the market. A portion of the floating shorts were still being covered, so the asking prices for various months were only down 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to the previous week. Until the opening in the afternoon, transactions were very light, and the market was loose and falling. Because the flour market was sluggish and sales were very quiet, asking prices fell again by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Only the bulls stubbornly resisted, and there were few new short positions, so trading became sparse. The spot wheat market remains stable, with no changes. Shandong Wuhe wheat opened at 9.05 yuan, Yaowan Shaheji Suzhou wheat at 5 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 4.85 yuan, Qijue 0.08 yuan, Jiangbei Suqian wheat at 4.82 yuan, Shashi wheat at 4.52 yuan, Hunan wheat at 4.5 yuan, Huaian wheat at 4.76 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.8 yuan for the high grade, 0.06 yuan for the second grade, and 0.051 yuan for the next grade. 8,000 bags were sent from Fuxin, and 1,500 bags were sent from Shenda.</p>
<h3>Special Feature Answer to Mr. Ding Renjun of the Bangbu Yixing Company</h3>
<p>(1) Liverpool (i.e., Hanmai): Each unit is a "peck," weighing 112 pounds. Twenty pecks make a ton (i.e., 2240 pounds), equivalent to 2032 catties in the market scale.</p>
<p>Chicago (i.e., American wheat): Each unit is a "bushel," weighing 60 pounds. 33.33 bushels make a ton (i.e., 2000 pounds), equivalent to 1814.24 catties in the market scale. Canada is the same.</p>
<p>(2) The prices of British and American gold exchanges published in the newspaper are calculated based on one or one hundred national currency units. Conversion can be done accordingly.</p>
<p>(3) The cost of ordering foreign wheat sometimes fluctuates. According to common practice, when a deal is made, it is based on CIFC, which includes freight, insurance, and the agreed-upon wheat price. The ordering party only needs to inspect and receive the goods at the unloading location. As for FOB, it only covers up to the loading of the ship at the wheat production site, excluding other expenses. The difference between CIFC and FOB is about seventeen shillings per ton. The choice between the two depends entirely on the ordering party's preference. The transportation costs and freight can be deduced from these figures for clarity.</p>
<p>(4) The market prices of foreign wheat are all standard. The situation is similar to the standards of our country's exchange. Because the quality of the spot goods varies, the pricing is naturally different. It is like the wheat in our country, where the market value sometimes exceeds the standard and sometimes it is the opposite. Even for various spot goods, the difference between high and low prices can be three to five jiao. Therefore, operators should understand the names but not necessarily the actual quality.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding inquiries, the author has tried to provide detailed answers within a possible scope. However, there is no need to answer trivial matters. Your understanding is appreciated.</p>

<h3>Large Arrival of Foreign Indica Rice Still Causes Price Stagnation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival volume of foreign indica rice remained high, with ample stock in the market. The source of supply continued unabated, and shipments kept arriving. Hence, merchants were rather anxious and sought to sell at extremely low prices. Yesterday, buyers from Guangdong province became active again, and the market suddenly livened up. 14,000 bags of unpolished Hankou rice were sold, all purchased by Guangdong buyers. Buyers from Shantou also had a strong appetite, invigorating business on this street. However, as merchants were eager to sell, prices could not rise significantly. If the rate of sales continues to be strong, then the market may improve. Yesterday's shipments included over 2,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,200 bags of Hunan rice, 14,000 bags of unpolished Hankou rice, 600 bags of unpolished Jiangbei rice, and 2,000 bags of Guangdong indica rice.</p>
<h3>No Improvement in Sales of Heshia Rice</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was limited to numbers 12 and 13, totaling 2,400 to 2,500 piculs. Retail sales remained sluggish. Qingdao Dasu buyers purchased 500 to 600 bags of thin early japonica rice. Consequently, the price of thick early japonica rice continued to decline. The price of thin rice was fixed. Dongxin japonica rice experienced no rise or fall. Xin Yanglu and other top grades decreased slightly by five cents. Yinbianyuan remained at the same price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the Heshia rice supply came from numbers 34 and 35. Merchants sold various types of rice at a small profit to expedite sales. The market showed a slight increase for high-quality broken japonica rice. Medium and lower grades decreased by one or two cents. Xin Yangjian rice saw a sharp decline of two or three cents. Xinbujian, Yinbianyuan, thin rice, and Chen Yangjian also decreased slightly by a few cents to about one cent. Xin Tuanjian rice sold at the same price. The prices of Dongxi Xin japonica rice were similar. Xin Kejian rice prices weakened by nearly one cent.</p>
<h3>The Authority of the Chef (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>(5) Power of Life and Death in Their Hands</p>
<p>"If someone gets sick from eating my food, it's the same as me getting sick. I would lose face." This was said by a German working for a German manager, Woolefu, who was the manager of the Qingdao Ti Du Lou hotel. Therefore, he urged all chefs and technicians to maintain cleanliness to the utmost degree. Even the cooking pots had to be scrubbed with sandpaper every night to make them bright and new; using ordinary furnace ash was considered too dirty. "Treating others' hunger as one's own," "Treating others' drowning as one's own," a chef with such a demeanor shows the sense of responsibility and national morality of people from that country.</p>
<p>In fact, let's recall: "So-and-so died from eating a certain meal and getting sick," such statements are often heard. During the years of the Republic of China (1919-1920), when a certain school in Hangzhou was disturbed by a case of poison in the rice pot, the authority of the chef was naturally felt to be particularly great. An American elementary school health book stated, "The chef's job is more important than most lawyers, doctors, civil servants, and teachers," which is absolutely correct. Because: indeed! If a chef is even slightly careless, and some pathogenic organisms contaminate the food, it might end the life of the homeowner or customer. In other words, acts of "hiding a sword in the fish" can be seen everywhere in society, and no one should consider it the special province of Zhuan Zhu.</p>
<p>In our country's autocratic era, the phrase "salt and plums" in cooking was used to metaphorically refer to managing the world and governing with deliberation. However, in the past, we only knew that it was important in the positive sense, especially in terms of flavoring and promoting appetite. Now that health principles have become clear, three major negative responsibilities have been added to the chef and cook's role. One is the control of food components, which must be properly controlled so that the people who eat it are sufficiently nourished and do not suffer from malnutrition or various nutrient deficiencies. One is the guarantee of food hygiene, which must be properly guaranteed so that the people who eat it do not suffer from various dirty diseases and intestinal parasitic diseases. The other is the easily digestible preparation of food, which must be prepared carefully so that the people who eat it do not suffer from digestive problems or indigestion. Among these, the second is the most serious and urgent.</p>
<p>To avoid accidental errors in the second aspect, the author has two very common secrets to share with my respected chefs! At the same time, I would like to ask those who employ chefs to pay attention to checking them!</p>
<p>One is called "fire to the point where the pig's head is tender"; the other is called "old but not wrong, is clean."</p>
<h3>From the Failure of the Olympic Games to Full Body Health Checkups</h3>
<p>— Gu Honglie</p>
<p>The Olympic Games held in Berlin, Germany, in August of this year can be described as a competition for national health. Whoever has a healthy and great physique has the best chance of winning the championship. The athletes attending from various countries are all elite athletes from their respective countries. When our country's athletes were sent abroad, we fully expected them to win championships and bring honor to the motherland. Who knew that from the opening to the closing ceremony, news came that athletes from various countries had won gold, silver, and bronze medals, while our country returned empty-handed? Wags said that we got a big duck egg. Some blamed our country's athletes for not fighting hard enough, but in reality, the decisive injury in our country's failure in the Olympic Games was a physique that was not great and strength that was inferior to others. We cannot ignore the facts and falsely accuse the athletes. According to historical statistics, the physique of the Chinese people is gradually shrinking, and at the same time, life expectancy is gradually decreasing. Compared with our eastern neighbor Japan, which was often called a short country in the past, in recent decades, because the government authorities have paid attention to national health and implemented healthy marriages, the physique of the people in that country has become stronger and stronger from generation to generation, and life expectancy has also become longer and longer from generation to generation. Therefore, if our entire country does not pay attention to health checkups and healthy marriages, and even knowingly marries someone who has a disease that can be passed on to future generations because of status, the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." It is a natural principle that the descendants passed down by unhealthy partners will certainly not be healthy. If the Chinese people continue to be unaware and do not wake up, then the shame of being called the "Sick Man of East Asia" will never be erased. It is not only the elimination from the Olympic Games that is shameful. The performance of our country's soccer team in this Olympic Games won profound and accurate criticism. It was said that the first half would be a draw, and in the second half, China would lose two goals. The result was as expected. Good technique is certainly important, but the final judgment of victory or defeat depends on whether physical strength can last. This year, I am serving at the Hongqiao Sanatorium. Because of our country's dismal defeat in the Olympic Games and the full body health checkups conducted at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, I deeply feel the following thoughts.</p>
<p>Full body checkups are an urgent measure for individuals, families, society, and the country. After a checkup, many unconscious diseases can be discovered. The progress of modern medicine and health is rapid. People generally know that treating a disease is not as good as preventing it, and early treatment is better than crying for help when the disease is incurable. According to my experience of more than ten years, patients who come to the hospital for treatment often find that other diseases are progressing at the same time, but the patients are not aware that the hidden dangers are deep and life is approaching its end. They still hope for treatment until it is too late. Alas, the number of sacrifices like this who do not know to undergo full body checkups early is countless.</p>
<p>The procedure for a checkup starts with a general assessment of the whole body, and then proceeds to each organ in order. Whether body temperature, pulse, and breathing are normal, whether blood pressure is elevated, whether body weight and height are suitable for the standard number compared to age, whether nutrition is sufficient, and whether development is complete are not difficult to know after a checkup.</p>
<p>As for each organ, whether the skin has diseases and what the cause is, skin diseases are divided into internal and external causes. How is the vision of the eye, is there the most common trachoma? How is the hearing of the ear, is there pus flowing? Is the inside of the nose normal? Are there any obstacles in the respiratory tract? Are the teeth, the first organ for digesting food, neat and strong? How is the throat? Are the tonsils enlarged? Is there lymph node swelling in the neck? Is the thyroid gland normal? Is the position, size, and sound of the heart in the chest normal? Is the percussion and auscultation of the lungs normal? Are the positions and functions of the spleen, liver, stomach, etc. in the abdomen normal? Is the development of the reproductive organs healthy? Is there a hernia? Is the posture of the whole body abnormal? If so, should it be corrected? All of this can also be known by examination.</p>
<p>For others, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which can determine the strength of the body's resistance, the Wassermann reaction, which can know the presence or absence of syphilis in the body, the examination of urine, which can know the changes in the body's material metabolism, the examination of stool, which can know the existence of parasites, the examination of sputum, which can know the presence or absence of tuberculosis bacteria, and the thickness of the blood, which can be known by taking a few drops of blood from the finger or ear, are all things that should be paid attention to for overall health.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Hygiene for Ear, Nose, Throat and Eye Diseases</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(101) What is Color Blindness?</p>
<p>Human eyes can distinguish all colors because the retina at the back of the eye has a function to distinguish colors. This function is called color vision in medicine. The cone cells in the retina are responsible for color vision. The cone cells are most numerous near the macula of the retina, so their color vision is also the most sensitive. Conversely, in the green part of the retina's edge, color vision is slow. There is a lack of sensitivity to red and green colors. If this color vision is weakened or disappears, it is called color blindness. Medically speaking, color blindness can be divided into two types: congenital and acquired. Namely:</p>
<p>(1) Congenital color blindness – mostly caused by incomplete development.</p>
<p>(2) Acquired color blindness – generally caused by diseases of the retina, choroid, and optic nerve, etc. The two are described separately below. (1) Congenital color blindness – Congenital color blindness usually occurs in both eyes. Its degree varies, some deep and some shallow. When the degree is shallow, the patient finds it slightly difficult to distinguish colors and is often hesitant. When the degree is deep, the patient is almost completely unable to distinguish colors (either red or green). However, color blind patients often do not realize they have any disability. It is not until a physical examination that it can be discovered and proven. Those with complete color vision deficiency are called total color blindness. Those with weakened color vision are called total color weakness. Those with red-green color vision deficiency but healthy blue-yellow color vision are called red-green color blindness. Mild cases are called red-green color weakness. Among them, red-green color blindness and red-green color weakness can each be divided into two: red color blindness and green color blindness, and red color weakness and green color weakness.</p>
<p>Total color blindness and total color weakness are rare eye diseases. The diseased eye of total color blindness cannot sense color at all. As a result, all objects appear gray. Although there are gradations of brightness and darkness, there is no color. Sometimes, there is also photophobia and nystagmus. It is more common in those whose parents are blood relatives. Total color weakness refers to the simultaneous weakening of red-green and blue-yellow color vision.</p>
<p>Red-green color blindness is the most common type of color vision impairment. Four to five percent of men suffer from this disease. One-tenth of women suffer from this disease compared to men. There is also a hereditary relationship.</p>
<p>(2) Acquired color blindness – During various eye diseases, color field defects can often occur. At this time, there is mostly visual impairment and central or green defects in the visual field. Generally, in diseases of the optic nerve, the sensation of red and green is impaired. Red is seen as dark red. Green is seen as green-gray. In diseases of the retina and choroid, blue-yellow is first affected. Blue is seen as black or green. Yellow is seen as white or gray.</p>
<p>The danger of color blindness – The danger of color blindness is completely different depending on the occupation. Ordinary occupations such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers, and those serving in the banking, political, and business worlds are not greatly affected if they are color blind. As for painters and occupations related to pigments, it is already inconvenient and hinders work. The most dangerous are occupations such as captains, pilots, airplane pilots, train drivers, and car drivers. This is because if these professions are color blind, the traffic lights lose their effectiveness immediately. Therefore, danger can occur at any time. Therefore, when conducting physical examinations for these occupations, it is necessary to carefully and thoroughly check for color blindness. If any is found, they should change to other occupations and should never make any compromises.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Q &amp; A About Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(92) Foreign Objects and Stones in the Bladder</p>
<p>(Q) How can foreign objects exist in the bladder?</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(A) Because sometimes the catheter is inserted carelessly and breaks or small objects are inserted carelessly due to playing around, causing them to remain in the bladder.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the dangers of foreign objects in the bladder?</p>
<p>(A) It is often the main cause of bladder bleeding or gradually causes the bladder to become ulcerated. It can also become the central nucleus of bladder stones.</p>
<p>(Q) How are bladder stones formed?</p>
<p>(A) The main reason is the descent of kidney stones or the presence of foreign objects as the central nucleus, which are decomposed by alkaline urine, causing calcium phosphate and ammonium urate to adhere to them, gradually becoming larger.</p>
<p>(Q) Among the components of bladder stones, which is more common, phosphate or urate?</p>
<p>(A) Generally, phosphate stones are more common.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a relationship between age and people with bladder stones?</p>
<p>(A) Many elderly people have them. Some children also have them.</p>
<p>(Q) Is there a relationship with gender?</p>
<p>(A) More men have them than women.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms occur when bladder stones develop?</p>
<p>(A) Pain is the main symptom, radiating to the rectum and glans penis. The key is urinary obstruction, interrupted urination. Hematuria also occurs.</p>
<p>(Q) How to diagnose?</p>
<p>(A) For pain, only symptomatic treatment is performed to temporarily stop the pain. The radical cure requires surgical procedures such as lithotripsy and lithotomy.</p>
<p>(Q) Before bladder stones develop, how can we know in advance that there are calcium phosphate and other salts in the urine?</p>
<p>(A) If the urine is often turbid, it can be determined that there are lime salts, which are the elements of stone formation and should be paid attention to as early as possible.</p>
<h3>Native Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>5. Motherwort *Leonurus sibiricus*, L.</p>
<p>(Plant) It grows naturally in the wilderness and is an annual herb. The stem is 1 to 1.5 meters tall. Some plants are hairless throughout, while others have fine hairs. The leaves have long petioles, are pinnately deeply divided, and the segments are linear. The leaf axils have verticillasters. The red-purple labiate flowers bloom in summer. The achenes are trigonous.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Motherwort (芜蔚) *Herba Leonri*, is the dried whole plant with flowers collected.</p>
<p>芫蔚子 *Semen Leonuri*, is the seed collected. The surface of the wood product is gray-black and shaped like a slightly elongated particle with three ridges, no more than two millimeters long.</p>
<p>Motherwort means it is effective for treating women's diseases. The plants *L. Cordiacus* and *L.* in the United States, called *Lotherwort*, are also gynecological drugs.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The leaves contain crystalline substances of Leonuri, 0.5% fatty oil, foul-smelling brain components, resin, etc. Recently, Japanese scientists Kubota and Nakajima isolated a crystalline alkaloid composed of Ci3H2oN4O4, named Leonurin.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) When Leonurin is injected subcutaneously into 20-day-old mice, it instantaneously causes intermittent spasms, weakens respiration, and eventually causes systemic paralysis, resulting in respiratory silence. After respiratory arrest, the heart continues to beat. The minimum lethal dose for a 20-day-old mouse weighing 1 gram is 0.6-0.7 micrograms. When Lnurin is applied to the isolated uterus of a rabbit, it significantly increases its tension and increases the degree of uterine movement. It also has a diuretic effect.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) Old sayings: Motherwort is a hemostatic and tonic for women after childbirth. A single dose is 4-6 grams, used as a decoction. 芫蔚子 is also a diuretic and can treat eye diseases, used as a decoction.</p>
<p>It brightens the eyes, nourishes essence, eliminates water, treats wind, relieves fever, regulates qi. It regulates women's meridians, metrorrhagia and leukorrhea, postpartum and antenatal diseases. Long-term use can help women conceive.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Local News Section of *Shen Bao*</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Monks Exempt from Civic Training</h3>
<p>— Wujue</p>
<p>Monks were once called "bald bandits" by some, but this title is really too broad. Because not every monk is a "bald bandit", so even if they chant scriptures all day long, they are not excluded from citizenship. However, obligations and rights are opposed to each other. Since monks have obtained the rights of citizens, they naturally have to fulfill the obligations of citizens, and undergoing civic training is one of the obligations of citizens. But now, Master Taixu has petitioned the government to cancel civic training for the following reasons:</p>
<p>"Buddhists cherish compassion and abstain from killing. If monks who chant scriptures all day long are made to wield weapons and engage in battlefield life, I am afraid they will not be able to do so. Therefore, I am petitioning for cancellation and requesting that they be given corresponding first aid knowledge. Once something happens, they can serve as rear nurses, which they will be able to do happily. They can also publicize religious doctrines in their spare time, killing two birds with one stone!"</p>
<p>What is this! In the eyes of the monks, this is indeed killing two birds with one stone, but we think that it is not only impossible to "kill two birds with one stone" but will "lose several", even "perish together"! Why? Since Buddhists cherish compassion and abstain from killing, they naturally embrace the "suffering" doctrine of non-resistance to foreign aggression. Even if the enemy points a gun at his chest, he will not fight back. If he accidentally hurts the enemy by fighting back, wouldn't that shake his belief in compassion and violate the precept of abstaining from killing?</p>
<p>But people's hearts are not what they used to be. Compassion and abstaining from killing, although beautiful names, are just names, like peace. No matter how compassionate you are, you cannot move the ruthlessness of others. The reason is very simple: to survive, you must struggle. If you don't struggle, you will only die. So after reading Master Taixu's proposal, I worried for the monks. Because according to this situation, it is not necessarily in the monks' best interest. Even if the monks all have the spirit of "suffering," and die without complaint, they will only make a meaningless sacrifice for the country and the nation!</p>
<p>However, the degree of danger is not limited to this. According to Master Taixu's statement, it is best to give monks first aid knowledge, so that they can serve as rear nurses and publicize religious doctrines in their spare time. Now, let's not discuss whether monks can really perform nursing duties happily, because we know that the best nurses are women. Asking clumsy monks to do women's work is somewhat out of place. And what is most unacceptable is "publicizing religious doctrines!" Although believing in religion is an individual's freedom, in this time when national consciousness needs to be promoted, going to publicize Buddhist ideas of transcending the world to those soldiers who "wield weapons to defend the country," and asking them to "cherish compassion" and "abstain from killing," isn't that intentionally putting the Chinese nation in a position of eternal ruin to be slaughtered by others?</p>
<p>Although we do not want to deliberately find fault with people, we believe that Master Taixu's unrealistic theory, even if spoken unintentionally, also has the appearance of becoming a traitor. We love Taixu, we love the monks who are in the same boat with us, and we feel that this "publicizing religious doctrines" is utterly unacceptable.</p>
<p>Even if we retreat a hundred steps, we admit that monks can be exempted from civic training and can be exempted from battlefield life, but they cannot be nurses, and they must never "publicize religious doctrines" in their spare time to "kill two birds with one stone".</p>
<h3>A Visit to Lide Oil Factory, One of China's Four Major Oil Factories</h3>
<p>— Xishan</p>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) China's oil pressing industry plays a significant role in the annual export of goods. Therefore, in the past few years, oil pressing has been a very developed industry. However, currently, under the impact of the economic recession affecting all industries, many oil pressing factories have also suffered significant blows. In order to gain a general understanding of the current state of the oil pressing industry, I made a special trip to the Lide Oil Factory on West Suzhou River Road yesterday for a visit.</p>
<p>Lide Oil Factory is one of China's four major oil factories. Since its establishment, it has a rather long history, so its internal scale is also quite large. When I went to visit, Director Liu of the factory personally received me and first led me into the reception room for a few minutes of rest.</p>
<p>On the four walls of the reception room, many statistical reports on the annual production and export volume of China's oil pressing industry were hung. According to the latest statistics, in Shanghai alone, the number of oil pressing factories, large and small, has decreased from more than 20 to 14, and their total capital is only about one million yuan. As a result, the production volume has also decreased year by year, averaging only 240,000 dan of oil and 680,000 dan of oil cake per year. After I read the above report, Director Liu also showed me the production volume table of the Shanghai oil pressing industry for the past few years. Comparing them, it is clear that the oil pressing industry in Shanghai has also fallen into a state of decline in recent years.</p>
<p>Director Liu told me that the oil pressing industry throughout the country produces many types of oil, the common ones being tung oil, raw oil, soybean oil, castor oil, tea oil, vegetable oil, and more than a dozen others, with the widest sales. However, for business reasons, the factory is currently only producing coconut oil and cottonseed oil. So, first, we went to visit the coconut oil workshop.</p>
<p>The work of pressing coconut oil can be divided into four parts: (1) Raw material sorting: The work of this part is to first gather the transported raw materials in one place. After the workers' inspection and sorting, they are placed into the baking oven. In the baking oven, the coconuts are baked once, then taken out and transferred to the cake making area for the second part of the work. (2) Cake making: The coconuts that have been baked become soft, loose powder. Therefore, they must be made into oil cakes of a specified area before they can be placed in the pressing machine. The workers in this part make the coconuts into rectangular oil cakes, with a common area of about 100 cubic inches. (3) Pressing work: The made oil cakes are placed back into the baking oven to dry. After drying, they are placed in the pressing machine. This type of pressing machine has a great force, and each machine can simultaneously press dozens of the prepared coconut cakes. (4) Filtering work: After the pressing machine presses the coconut cakes, the oil extracted flows entirely into the oil tank. Because the oil still contains impurities, it must undergo a filtering process in the tank to remove the impurities from the oil so that it can become pure coconut oil. Then, it is injected into the storage tank through oil pipes. After the coconut is pressed, the remaining residue becomes extremely hard oil cake. Some of this oil cake is directly packaged for export, while some is ground into powder by a grinder, depending on the supply and demand situation.</p>
<p>The second part of the visit was the cottonseed oil factory. This workshop is divided into two floors. The bottom floor is the raw material storage area for cottonseed oil. The upper floor is the cottonseed sorting and pressing workshop. The process of pressing cottonseed oil is slightly more complicated. Because the cottonseed raw materials are mixed with cotton and other impurities when they are transported, they must undergo a cleaning process before pressing to obtain pure cottonseed. When work begins, the cottonseed raw materials are lifted from the storage area on the bottom floor, bag by bag, into the cotton gin on the upper floor. After the cottonseed passes through the cotton gin, the mixed cotton and impurities are separated from the cottonseed. The pure cottonseed flows separately into the . Like this,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, after another filtering process, cottonseed oil is completed.</p>
<p>After the pressing work is completed, another step is to pack it into barrels. After leaving the oil pressing workshop, I went with Director Liu to see the barrel filling situation.</p>
<p>Lide Oil Factory has three huge oil storage tanks, all equipped with oil release valves around them, which can be opened automatically, so the oil filling procedure is simple and convenient. According to Director Liu, several thousand barrels can be filled every day. The weight of the oil in the filled barrels cannot be completely accurate, so it needs to be weighed separately. Also, because the factory is located along the Suzhou River, it has its own ships for transporting the exported barrel oil.</p>
<p>After completing the visit, I feel that if China's oil pressing industry can be revitalized and its production efficiency increased, its future has the potential for extreme development. Because the export of vegetable oil occupies a very important position in China's foreign trade goods.</p>
<h3>A Kind Old Man</h3>
<p>— Qiying</p>
<p>——Miscellaneous Notes on a Mountain Trip, Part Four</p>
<p>The four of us rode our horses and galloped wildly along the mountain road, regardless of how loudly the old groom shouted behind us to slow down the horses. Although I was not good at riding, I almost slid off the saddle several times while going down the slopes, but I finally used all my strength to overcome these dangers. Gradually, my courage grew, as if I were a skilled rider. Several times, I went ahead of my companions, so the horses galloped even faster. The old groom, walking behind us, was left far, far behind, disappearing into the morning mist of the peaks.</p>
<p>The sunlight gradually leaped from the mountain gorge in the east to the high sky, stretching out its fiery giant hands and tightly grasping this bald, shadeless mountain road; but because of this, the yellow sand rose and filled the way ahead. We were sweating, and the horses were panting. Riding in the saddles, our legs and buttocks felt like they were baking in a fire. At this time, the horses couldn't lift their feet to gallop no matter what. No matter how much we whipped them, they didn't resist; they just opened their mouths wide, constantly gasping for air, and white foam rolled out of their mouths. Sweat soaked their bodies. The thin bones between their thighs stood out high, their bellies deflated, and they looked so weak, as if they had just recovered from a serious illness. These four skinny horses, how old they were! Each of them had a pair of blood-red, tearful eyes, as if they were angrily staring at us, or as if they were pleading with us!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the four of us were moved, and I was reminded of the old groom, who was as weak as the horses and chasing after us. He probably wouldn't be as tired as the horses, unable to lift his weak feet, and fainting in some valley. Or he might be crying to the sky: "Gentlemen, aren't you four horse thieves who have stolen my horses?"</p>
<p>Thinking like this, we sat down on a large rock by the side of the road. If the horses hadn't refused to take another step, we really would have wanted to take the horses back to meet the old groom!</p>
<p>There wasn't any water to drink by the side of the road, and we were almost dying of thirst. It happened to be noon, and the sun was scorching hot. Sitting there, we were all sweating, and thinking of the old groom chasing after us under the scorching sun, we couldn't help but shiver with a feverish chill, and a pang of sadness welled up in our hearts. Watching the sunlight gradually climb over the middle of the sky, and still not seeing a single figure on the road, our hearts were even more flustered. Moreover, we still had to rush to the foot of the mountain ahead to stay overnight today.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the sun had slanted to the west that the old groom appeared at the end of the road in the distance. He was walking hurriedly, his body swaying, as if he were a camel carrying a heavy load. From far away, we could see his fatigue and how anxious he was!</p>
<p>The old man didn't know where he had picked up a tree branch, which he used as a cane, tapping the ground with it step by step. The way he looked made us laugh again. When he saw us appearing by the side of the road, the old man panicked, and his joyful mood reached an unimaginable degree. He hurriedly threw away his cane and ran towards us in a stumbling manner. Without exchanging words with us, he went straight to the four horses, touching their bodies with his hands, smelling their heads with his nose, and caressing their faces with his face... The old man was so happy that he was almost crazy. He muttered to himself, not knowing how to comfort his four hard-working horses. The old man simply forgot his own fatigue. The horses, which were originally weak, suddenly perked up at this time. As if seeing a relative, they wagged their heads and tails at the old groom.</p>
<p>A thought suddenly arose in our hearts. We wondered how the old groom would vent his anger in front of us. We quietly sat aside, waiting for the old man to question all our faults.</p>
<p>But, no one expected that the old man was so kind! He smiled kindly and walked towards us, comforting us like a father: "Gentlemen, you are tired, haha!" He smiled, not daring to approach us: "Gentlemen, I'm sorry to have troubled you and made you wait so long." He raised his head to look at the sun: "Alas! It's getting late, it's all my fault, haha, today..." He didn't dare to continue, took a few steps back, and stood there patiently, waiting for our reply. We were all deeply touched by him and couldn't say a word. This kind old man!</p>
<p>After a while, the old man spoke again with a trembling voice: "Gentlemen, if you don't mind, please come to my humble home for the night. There aren't many people in my family. Tomorrow, I'll make sure you can reach the foot of the mountain when you eat breakfast!"</p>
<p>That night, we stayed overnight in the old groom's home.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Elementary School</h3>
<p>— Ma Jia</p>
<p>After more than five years of unemployment, I was, in terms of appearance, a spiritually withered fellow. Wandering on the road, I really felt like a timid rat. I avoided the gaze of passers-by, those despicable eyes! They made people angry.</p>
<p>Today, I ran to a friend's school, and seeing my friend was busy, I felt a burst of grief. Alas: people are busy, but I am idle! My friend told me to sit down for a while!" I only felt that the sentence was too ironic.</p>
<p>When my friend finished working, he handed me a cigarette and asked me, "How have you been lately?" I only smiled sadly: "Isn't it the same as before—unemployed?"</p>
<p>My friend was very happy with my answer. He suddenly jumped up from the rattan chair, grabbed my shoulders, and said to me very happily, "Ma Jia! There's a position! Do you want it?"</p>
<p>Like a hungry dog, smelling the scent of beef, I drooled. I quickly replied to my friend: "There's a position? Why wouldn't I want it?"</p>
<p>So my friend told me that their school had a short-term elementary school, and they were short of a teacher. Since I didn't have a job, why not take it? Three hours of class every day, sixteen silver dollars a month. My friend said, "But it's a bit hard!" But for me, that was a "lucrative position"! Hard? Is there anything that doesn't take effort when it comes to eating? (To be continued)</p>

<p>North wind howls. Snowflakes fall. North wind howls. Crying out the sad tune of life. Snowflakes fall. Stirring up the annoyance in people's hearts. Flowers, you just fall. I ask you. Don't resign from hard work. You all night . Filling the roads for the coming and going pedestrians. Making the traces of people disappear in the streets and alleys. Do you remember firmly. My friends. North, South, East, and West, many footprints. Leaving traces in the snow. Can you watch carefully. Clear marks. Where should so many streets and alleys be searched for. North wind howls. Snowflakes. A burst of sadness enveloped. Snowflakes fall. A burst of desolation entangled. My heart follows the snowflakes falling. Scatteredly. Let my song accompany the north wind. Howling angrily.</p>

<p>The car is startling and征is污 blood. He also is loyal to the king on the road to death. He is also, supporting the country and relieving the difficulties. He generously donates money without being stingy. This is the unique beauty of heaven and earth. The mountains and rivers are full of energy. I admire him even more for the robes bestowed on him that have been praised for thousands of years. He has received honors that show the country's praise. There is also a son who is a symbol of great virtue. The family is loyal and willing to die. Later, the thieves harbored evil intentions and forcibly dismissed him.

<h3>United Hearts in Life and Death: A Terrifying Ancient Temple</h3>
<p>Mutilated Clay Statues of Gods Sticking Out Their Tongues and Walking</p>
<p>The second studio of Star Motion Picture Company on Avenue Albert has recently been permeated with a rather terrifying atmosphere. It should be clarified that this so-called terror is all based on the psychological effect on those who enter. There are no ghosts or demons that constitute terror, but people who enter often get frightened or even run out, especially when there are few people inside. Now, let me tell you this interesting story from beginning to end!</p>
<p>Ying Yunwei's "United Hearts in Life and Death" is actively in progress. A set of an ancient temple was built by the famous set designer Ma Shouhong. The ancient temple occupies a large part of the studio: dilapidated, desolate, and fragmented walls; a chaotic yard that has been abandoned for a long time; withered trees; a decapitated statue of a god holding a real sword guarding the entrance. Inside the temple, it is very high and spacious but very empty. Gigantic gods stare with their gray-black eyes, covered with dust webs, sitting fiercely in the high niches. Around them are clay gods, some with their hands cut off, some with their heads missing, some still looking like they are about to hit or catch people in the dust, some dragging out foot-long tongues, stretching out thin, long hands as if to pounce over. Ox-headed demons and horse-faced spirits, Black and White Impermanence, although covered by dust and cobwebs, their hideous attitudes are not diminished at all.</p>
<p>Before the set was completed, those ox-headed demons and horse-faced spirits, gigantic gods and strange images, were scattered in the dark corners everywhere. If you walked in unknowingly, and took a look to the east, a glaring monster would be staring at you. A glance to the west would reveal a huge demon! One would often be startled without meaning to be! Especially in the quiet when there are not many people, and the light in the studio is very dim.</p>
<p>Once, the studio was filming the set on the other side, it was Ouyang Yuqian's "Qingming Season." In addition to Liming Hui and Zhao Dan, there was also Miss Li Lilian acting. On this side, a worker was moving a grotesque ghost with a long tongue – because it was made of paper, it was very light and easy to move. However, people could not see it from behind. Li Lilian glanced casually and was shocked to see that the ghost was walking, dragging its tongue. She screamed loudly, even shedding tears. Only when she saw that someone was moving it did she breathe a sigh of relief and pat her chest.</p>
<p>This terrifying ancient temple in "United Hearts in Life and Death" is the residence of a strange revolutionary youth. The so-called strange revolutionary youth is a rather frightening character with a scarred face played by Yuan Muzhi.</p>
