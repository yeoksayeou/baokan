<h3 id="c6">英國對巴勒斯坦的宣言 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>從埃及而激盪到巴勒斯坦阿刺伯民族的反英運動。發生以來。快有五個月了。最近埃及的反英運動。因為英埃簽訂新的的綠故。已經吿了一個段落。可是阿刺伯民族的反英運動。却還繼長增高。因此英國殖民部發表了宣言。將調兵一師。前往巴勒斯坦。鎭壓叛亂。請就這項宣言的用意。來分析一下。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦在地中海東端。密接於蘇彝土運河北口的塞特港。形成蘇彝士運河的屛藩。且其海發港又是天然很好的軍港。和埃及尼羅河東口密邇相望。成為控制東地中海·埃及和蘇彝士運河的要隘。穌彝士運河旣是英國到達印度洋和太平洋的血管。要是牠的屛瀋——巴勒斯坦的統治權一旦喪失。英國在印度洋和太平洋的交通就要感到很大的威脅了。所以大戰以後。英國根據一九一六年英俄和英法密的的規定。從土耳其手中取得了巴勒斯坦的委任統治權。便利用着阿刺伯人和猶太人的仇恨。來鞏固它在那裏的統治權。更在加薩和舍拉芬建設航空根據地。開關海發港和死。海敷設伊拉克摩蘇爾到海發港的煤油管。興築巴格達到海發港的馬路。這些軍事工程都很顯著地設明着巴勒斯坦是英國對外用兵的必爭之地。英國所以不惜派遣大軍前去維持統治權。就是為此。</p>
<p>可是英國殖民部宣言中又說。願意和阿刺伯人從事談判。覓取解决紛擾的方法。為什麽英國打算採取和平手段呢。原來英國對於赤道回敎國家的侵略。已快到淸算的時期。西南亞洲的回敎國家。如土耳其·伊蘭·阿富汗·和伊拉克等。除土耳其外。都還受着英國的控制。但諸國已於數月前締結了攻守同盟條約。它們眼見着巴勒斯坦的回敎徒受了異敎徒的壓迫。自然會表示相當的同情。英國對阿刺伯人的過度壓迫。自然也會引起回敎國家的憤激。不但如此。蘇狄。阿剌伯的愛沙特正在努力建設一個包括西亞洲阿刺伯語人民所在的全部土地的聯邦。這對英國顯然也是一個重大的威脅。使它對阿刺伯民族的壓迫。不能不有所顧忌。</p>
<p>英國對巴勒斯坦的宣言。一方面表示着要調大軍前往鎭壓阿刺伯民族的反英運動。但另一方面又表示着願和阿刺伯人談判。覓取解决紛擾的辦法。從此可以看出英國對巴勒斯坦政策的矛盾來。在這種矛盾情勢之下。我們可知巴勒斯坦阿刺伯民族的反英運動。决不是容易解决的一回事。</p>

<p>有無根據</p>
<p>、答、今年三月六日晚上八時、我洗澡而　遭兇手高金生乘坐脚踏人　來、用硝鏹水將我澆傷、當　該兇手抓獲、現奉特二區法院已經判决、緣有吳正祥者、會向我告密、說朱廣涵對我很為不滿、我回憶去年十二月二十八日、亦會被人毆打、或許亦為朱廣涵等唆使、有陳文律師前來</p>
<p>向我和解</p>
<p>我未允可、惟有訴之於法、問、你當時對於朱廣涵等為何不告呢、答、因有顧昌元律師、屢决接洽談判云云、次據朱廣涵供、年四十二歲、松江人、住福煦路、因母病來申、賃屋求醫、我來往松江上海、惟住居松江日子為多、徐雪僧告我教唆傷害、突遭冤誣，問、你與徐雪僧是調帖弟兄嗎、答、是的、在上海調帖的、大約有</p>
<p>十年光景</p>
<p>了、問、旣為調帖弟兄、何以告你呢、答、因前者我被松江銀行倒去萬餘元、徐代我辦理、向該行交涉賠償、未有結果、他會經向我借去三百元及六百元、尚有亦記不淸了、問、陳阿錫你認識否、答、不認得、問、　央顧昌元律師至章士劉律師處和解有否、答、並無其事、訊至此、顧律師起稱、係與章律師</p>
<p>另案接洽</p>
<p>章問我與朱認燃否、我說認得、此係徐雪儈向章說我與朱素來相識、托我和解、我說和解刑事案件、我不呌我、在下午二三時到江維城家、迨我到江家、則馮子明探長亦在江家、江說</p>
<p>徐學僧事</p>
<p>亦發生了、因朱廣涵之妾死後、失與徐發生意見馮向我謂你認識徐雪儈的、不若托你為之和解、於是我去探望徐雪儈、談及和解一事、徐稱他有一妻兩妾、每月五百元開支、今年四十五歲、扣至六十歲止、如欲和解、必須</p>
<p>九萬六千</p>
<p>元、後來馮探長說為數太鉅難以接近、每月五十元、亦須九千六百元、凑成萬元、我再往醫院、與徐談判、徐未允、至開庭之日、朱廣涵至馮子明家聲稱、僅籌措得二千元、如多不能、馮卽</p>
<p>電話通知</p>
<p>我、後來徐雪儈請章士釗律師向鈞院起訴云云、最後由設人復鑫泉徐小三·陳　郎·等證述一過、問官以時已傍晚、遂諭改期再審、陳阿錫因病仍送新普育堂醫洽、高金生着收押、翌日、送回高三分院、徐雪儈因另案收押、迨退庭已萬家燈火矣、</p>

<p>至於儀器一項、自二十一年九月至二十三年六月、實支二四六·八一九元、自二十三年七月至二十五年六月、實支五八九·五七八元、其化學藥品等列入消耗項下者、概未計人、故四年實支儀器費達八三六·三九七元、總計圖書儀器費兩項、四年內實支數巳達一·二〇七·〇四二元、合計建築及圖書儀器設備費、四年內共一百八十七萬六千零三十元、</p>
<p>五、厲行減政節　省行政經費　以事建設</p>
<p>本校經費於改組後曾經减少、四年來並無增加、苟欲建設、自非裁减人員、節省行政經費不可、經四年之努力、亦不無微效可觀、計二十四年度之職員人數、較十八年度减少七十六人、較十九年度减少七十二人、（以前之醫商兩學院職員人數均已除去不計、而現在之醫學院及牙醫專科學校職員均已列入、）因二十四年再行减政、故較二十三年度實際上减少亦至十三人、教員人數（包括教授講師助教）則二十四年度較十八年度减少六十二人、較十九年度减少八十五人、至於行政費則十八十九兩年度均無從復核、數字甚難稽考、二十一年度改組後、會大加减縮一次、自二十一年度至二十四年度壓年遂漸緊縮、亦稍有成效、計二十一年度行政費佔總預算百分之十點五、二十二年度减至百分之九點五、二十三年度减至百分之九、二十四年度减至百分之八、此項結果、均從隨時銖積而來、自二十一年度至二十三年度本校未領特別經費而仍能稍有上列之建設者、未始非由此而來也、</p>
<p>六、整理課程</p>
<p>我國大學課程、往往名目繁多、缺乏有機體之組織、本校各院系、爰分別重定教育方針、將課程亦重新組織、使必修選修課目、均有明確規定、不欲因人因事而變更、課程之核心旣能形成、則教學之意義自可明瞭、此項工作、幸賴各院長系主任及教授之努力與協助、經長期討論、屆一年方大體完成、以後復隨時參酌事實、加以修訂、課程種類、多所刪併、而內容方面、則竭力使其充實、</p>
<p>二十四年度本校添設醫學院、牙醫專科學校及機械特別研究班、其課程設置均係根據部頒標準、國外各大學該科系課程設置之情形、與國內之實際需要詳為釐訂、全校課程仍使之為有機體之聯絡、</p>
<p>七、集中學者注重專任</p>
<p>學術本係專鬥事業、擔任教授者自應專心從事、本校頻年離亂、常感空虛、整理伊始、則極力挽留原有良好教授、而隨時羅致專門學者、歷年陸續添聘之教授講師、為數頗多、現各院系師資、大致均已充實、今後自仍隨時留意、多方延攬、俾本校蔚為各種學術專門人才之總薈也、同時更標一凡可請其專任者决不請其兼任之原則、實施結果、頗著成效、以往本校兼任教員、最多時共達一百一十一人、家倫到校後、力事裁减、二十一年度共有兼任教員八十一人、二十二年度减為八十人、二十三年度减為七十五人、至二十四年度則僅有三十四人、此少數之兼任教員、均係某種特殊科學之專家、係政府或其他學術機關所倚重、為本校所欲羅致而事實上有不可能者、得共一部分之精力時間、協助本校、自深感謝、而十五年度起、各年級齊全、課目减加、多由原有教師分別擔任、其熱心允可欽佩、</p>
<p>八、注重訓育　（一）設置訓導委員會</p>
<p>年來國內大學教育、大都側重於知識之液輸、而忽視學生品性之陶養、本校有鑒及此、力矯斯失、平時對於學生課外活動及其日常生活、時時予以適當之指導、四年以來、賴各教授之教導有方、與學生之奮發自愛、校風丕變、校譽漸增、為統一訓導方針起見、於去年九月間復設置訓導委員會、統籌一切訓導事宜、所有釐訂各種訓導規程、指導學生課外活動、評定學生操行成績、審議學生獎懲、輔導軍事管理等事項、統由該會主持辦理、使學生知識之探求與人格之修養、以及團體生活之習慣、得為平衡之發展、藉以養成良好之學風與健全之公民、</p>
<p>（二）實行軍事管理本校為養成學生生活軍隊化、行動紀律化、精神團體化起見、自二十四年度起實行軍事管理、一年級現受軍訓學生、均穿着制服、受軍事管理、並經製定軍事管理規程、組織軍專管理處、設置訓導委員會及大隊部、辦理一切教練管理及訓導事宜、（未完）</p>

<p>棉市大漲、因美棉二次估計報吿、較預料之額激减、飛漲五十一至六十三磅音、大阪三品花漲一元五六角、至二元外、於是市塲震盪、同時天時惡劣、降雨綿綿、目前棉花正在開絮之際、影響匪淺、人心活躍、買氣大振、各月均漲八角至一元、</p>
<p>遠期出四十元關</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉二次估計報吿發表額量為一千一百十二萬一千包、比上次激减一白三十六萬包、漲五十一至六十三磅音、大阪三品花漲二元外、於是市塲震撼、空方忍痛斬結、多頭又來加碼、雙方並駕齊驅、市價乃扶搖直上、又値白露節後、降雨甚大、深恐有長雨之患、因此買勢愈强、恒益·振大·賡豐·愼記·益昶·福康空頭一律抵進、遠月巳穿出四十元關外、惟益康·長豐·通記·明德·大昌成·梅記多頭吐出亦夥、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一元一二角、午後開盤降雨殊大、買風奇熾、而外商仍來拋賣、檯面稍平、迫至三牧盤回挫、結果各月比上午收盤價回跌一二角至三角、查賣出長豐一萬七千一百担、長和四千一百担、大昌成四千三百担、元一四千九百担、明德六千一百担、通記三千四百担、梅記二千三百担、生源二千担、益康一萬五千一百担、永昌二千五百担、仁豐三千二百担、泰昌一千七百祖、聚興二千担、同豐二千担、義成二千五百担、買進愼記一萬五千七百担、益昶七千二百担、福康五千四百担、源興昌三千担、同和二千四百担、永大二千三百担、賡豐七千一百担、振大三千四百担、信誠六千三百担、、森康五千担、大昶三千三百担、達記五千担、裕康二千七百担、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份均見昂貴、因洋麥報價、又續漲一角至四五角不等、市塲人心、因白露節後見雨、未免又多顧慮、且國外市塲、又亦轉變、是以買戶見暢、喊價即提三五分、入後則以粉市良好、又提一二分、迨至下午開盤、交易尙暢、市則轉平、較上午回落一二分、以此種漲風、實為人心所鼓動、非若粉銷起色、似有脚地可言也、現麥市面、因標準回振、各檔均喊起二三分、開山東麥四元九角二分、次四元九角、固鎭麥四元九角、次四元八角八分、瑤灣麥四元八角七分、决八角、淮安麥四元七角三分、决六角半、高郵麥四元七角半、决七角三分、江北麥四元七角三四分、蚌埠麥四元八角三分、决八角、蕪湖麥四元七角、决六角、竹鎭麥四元七角八分、决七角半、寳應麥四元七角三分、漢口麥四元五角半、湖南麥四元五角七分、南京麥四元七角、由福新去一萬包、阜豐去三千包、申大去一千包云、</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市場賣氣較涌、以四號為多、市價稍見疲軟、淮交易仍無起色、趨勢仍不脫盤旋狀况、存賬數目太少、新交易不起、投機家絕跡、故縱有環境上之刺激、市價依然不感震動、前途尙不易有鉅大波動也、昨日經過、開盤以四號賣出較多、跌落一二角左右『次盤卽見混沌、高低互見、稍有掉期交易、並有數種、毫無升降者、午後開盤、雖仍係升沉不定、盤旋於五分一角之間、但已為漲多跌少、收盤異常清淡、或則完全無人問津、或則毫無升降、或則仍高低於五分一角之間、似此一再沉悶、令人生厭、前途尙不易展開也、市價結果、略小一角至二角、成交總數、共計三百十九萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3 id="c188">堅苦卓絶的重耳 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 粟系</p>
<p>我國春秋時候，晋國有個公子名呌重耳，從小就有高大的志向，熱烈的愛國心腸，雖然經過種種困苦，和不堪忍受的羞辱：然而到後來一則因為有賢明的人才帮助，二則自己有深密的心思，剛毅的志向，所以到底能夥實行尊重天子，做到霸王事業。這個故事，中間有許多曲折情形，且聽慢慢講來。</p>
<p>起初重耳的父親晋獻公，受了寵姬的誘惑，把他們弟兄三人嚇跑了，後來獻公死了，晋國百姓才接重耳的弟弟夷吾回去，立為晋君，這就呌惠公。</p>
<p>重耳當然就是惠公的哥哥了，他年輕的時候，就想做霸王的首領，他常常自言自語道：</p>
<p>「我長成之後，定要做個首領，呌各方諸侯聽我的使喚。」</p>
<p>他非但有這個很大的志願，並且還有極聰明極能幹的人帮助他，像狐偃，咎犯，趙衰，先軫，和賈佗等五位，都是他的左右手。</p>
<p>他胸中懷着大志、，從本國出來，先逃到蒲城。他的父親獻公暗中差人到蒲城，想把他同帮他的賢人一起殺掉，除却後患。他們得到這個消息，便一同跑到狄國去了。</p>
<p>重耳到狄國的時候，恰巧狄國進有一個極賢淑的女子，狄君遂把她嫁了重耳，夫婦倆雖過着很快樂的日子，然而他要做首領的志願，仍舊還勿曾忘掉，他常常對她說：</p>
<p>「我非但要做晋君，我還要做霸王的首領，讓各方諸侯來聽話，那時我是怎樣的高興呢！」</p>
<p>她聽完這話後，遂勉勵他道：</p>
<p>「大丈夫本色，本來應該這樣啊！」</p>
<p>重耳跑到狄國，原來不過借此養息養息，現在養息够了，並且恐怕惠公派人來害，决定主意，要到各强國去遊歷遊歷，可以增長見識，然後設法回國。便向趙衰說道：</p>
<p>「齊桓公是個很賢明的人，我們到他那個地方去罷。」</p>
<p>在臨走時候，夫婦倆免不得難分難捨，重耳對他妻子道：</p>
<p>「我在二十五年裏，就想做霸主的頭兒：如果做不成，你就去嫁人罷。」</p>
<p>他的妻子道：</p>
<p>「廿五年後，我的頭髮也白了？再說得着嫁人麼？我决心等着你，請你專心一志的去創造大事業，並且祝你早日成功！」</p>
<p>重耳等於是離開狄國，路經衛國，文公很慢待他，一路走去，過五鹿的時候，他肚裏餓到兩腿無力，不能行動了，就向野人要吃。野入也輕視他，便把食物擲在士器上，重耳受這樣的羞辱，心中很怒，要把這無禮的野人立刻殺了。趙衰在旁勸道：</p>
<p>「這是預祝你成功大事的先兆，土器就是表顯你將來定有很大的土地。你為什麼怒呢！」</p>
<p>重耳聽他的話，便不怒了，就接受食物，謝了野人，又慢慢的向齊國去。到了齊國，桓公很優待，並把他的族女嫁給重耳。後來他住在齊國兩年多，享受了很美滿的生活，甚至連自己想還本國的事，要做霸王的事，也漸漸地忘了。</p>
<p>趟衰等知道如果這樣的長久下去，重耳的大志願大事業，一定要無形銷滅的，便常常商議着想法把他離開齊國　有一天他們商議的話閒接的被齊女知道了，她就勸她的丈夫重耳說：</p>
<p>「你是晋國公子，担負責任很重的，應該想法回晋國去。大丈夫的志氣要高，不可只為着一個婦人而把遠大的志氣銷滅，况且還有跟你的這樣聰明，這樣為你辛苦的幾個賢人，你豈可置之不睬，對得起他們麼？」</p>
<p>齊女這樣的苦勸幾决，重耳依舊不聽，齊女只得同趙衰等商量，先用酒灌醉了他，然後技他坐車上路。趙衰中暗想這樣一個婦（指齊女）竟不做自私自利的事，且能力勸重耳，深明大義，實在可感佩，不覺向齊女道謝</p>
<p>過了幾天，重耳已經在沉醉中上車，被人把他送出齊國了，走沒多遠，他已淸醒，心很不願，要加罪於咎犯，咎犯知道他的意思，遂勸道：</p>
<p>「我的志願，就是盼望你大事成功，殺我罪我，决不怕的。」</p>
<p>重耳餘怒未息，恨恨的說道：</p>
<p>「假使將來我功不成，定要吃你的肉。」</p>
<p>咎犯聽了，很勇幹，很忠實的答道：</p>
<p>「倘若你將來不幸失敗，那時我必計窮力盡早已死了，肉也爛了，你還原吃麽？　　　、</p>
<p>重耳聽到這話，心中突然醒悟，並且很覺慚愧，便一聲不響的趕路去了。他們先向曹國去，共公很慢待，再到宋國，襄公很歡迎。重耳見宋國兵力很强，想借這枝兵還本國去，後來聽了咎犯的勸，方始作罷。再往前走，到鄭國去了，文公也慢待他，鄭叔瞻那時已看定重耳是個很有才幹，有大志的人，將來恐為難鄭國，勸文公趁這時把他殺了。幸虧文公不曾聽他的話，然而重耳已經危險極了。後來他們跑到楚國去，成王極優待他，有一天他們正在宴會的時候，酒也喝醉了，楚王向重耳道：</p>
<p>「如果你能够做了晋君以後，用什麼報答我呢？」</p>
<p>重耳一面摩弄着他的劍柄，一面笑道：</p>
<p>「這珍貴的東西很多，决不會再要了，或者將來我們打仗的時候，我定能讓你九十里地。」</p>
<p>在那時楚將子玉聽了很怒，要請楚王殺他，楚王很知道重耳是個有才幹的人，並且他有許多賢明的人帮他，這樣一個能耐苦，有毅力的人，决不能殺掉的，故而未殺。可是重耳又經過一次多大的危呢？</p>
<p>後來他到秦國去的時候，恰巧晋惠公死了，晋國就派人到秦國來接他，秦國也就派人歡送他還國，做晋國的君，這就呌晋文。他那時已是一個白髮斑斑的老頭了。但是他不肯因年老而灰心，仍要做覇王事業呢。</p>
<p>文公四年，各諸侯約同楚國，去欺侮宋國。宋求晋帮助，重耳因為楚國早前曾經優待過他，現在不好意思同他為難，然而宋是小國，這些弱小的民族，又不能不帮助他，所以兩面為難了。後來聽了狐偃的話，知道楚國剛打敗曹國，且同衛國有親，用了計策，先去打曹衛。果眞楚國移兵救曹衛去了，宋國的圍遂解開了。後來楚國又去攻宋，宋又向晋來求救，重耳迫得沒法了，就和楚兵打仗，在剛起始交戰的時候，他就令自己的兵，一律先退九十里，就是實踐他在楚國時曾經允許楚王的前言。結果楚兵大敗。重耳就把捉到的許多楚兵，獻給周天子，並且很恭敬的跪着說道：</p>
<p>「楚國弗能尊重天子意旨，擾亂各國諸侯，靠了强國的威勢，來欺侮弱小的民族。我們仗着正義，就把他打平了。現在把這些俘虜，願獻陛下，表示我們永遠尊重天子的意思啊。」</p>
<p>周天子聽見重耳的話，心裏很是歡喜，便重重的賞賜他，他恭恭敬敬拜跪了幾决，才敢受領，從此重耳就稱霸了。</p>
<p>他一生經過了怎樣的困苦，怎樣的羞辱，全靠自己能够堅持主義，所以到底達到稱霸的志願了。這樣說來這「堅苦卓絕」四字，重耳可以當之無愧了。</p>
<h3 id="c189">戲劇家蕭伯納 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 李希實</p>
<p>在民國二十二年二月，蕭伯納曾來過中國，在上海祗停留了一天，就到北平去了。他到北平去的目的是觀瞻我國古代的遺跡與名勝。那時中國有許多文學家，政治家，都紛紛地去垂詢蕭伯納對於我國人民有什麼意見發表，讀者諸君想必記得，那時平津的時勢像目前一樣的嚴重。不過熱河還在中央政府的統轄之下呢，這位年將八旬而特獨康健的蕭伯納就發表了以下的意見，他說：「中國此時正在危急存亡之秋，我不敢貢獻什麼意見，只希望中國人民，能從此自救，因為中國人民，果眞能一心一德，共同努力，我相信世界上沒有那一種人能與他們抵抗的」。</p>
<p>蕭伯納生於一八五六年英國愛爾廿島的都伯林地方，他的父親是一個年邁退職的小官吏，却酷愛飲酒，這位年邁酒徒，認淸了前途的暗淡與責任的重大，於是將來的養老金悉數拿來做麵包的生意，結果與預期的希望完全相反，不但不能增進生活上的妥定，反而變成赤貧如洗了；在这次的失敗以後不久，他就因悲痛過甚抑鬱長逝了。</p>
<p>幸而蕭伯納的母親，不像她丈夫那樣容易遇到挫折就灰心，她立定了目標向前奮鬬。因為她對於音樂有特殊的興趣，所以在她丈夫過後不久，由於加意的努力，居然在都伯林的音樂界上，獲得一個相當的地位，靠了每日的收入，撫養着她的孤兒與自己兩條苦命。蕭伯納這樣一位天才的母親，雖然處着這樣的環境，誠然還是十二分幸福的。以後她在文壇上獲得了至高的助威，我們不能忽視了他母親的功績的。</p>
<p>蕭伯納在小學校里讀書的時候，可以說是一個不肯被環境屈服的孩子，他讀書非常用功，但是他反對無意思的死讀書，他看到許多同學一天到晚的捧着敎科書，不厭其煩的死讀，先生呌他們讀到那里，他們就讀到那里，一點不管這課文的意義究竟有吾徹底明瞭，蕭伯納對於這樣讀書的人是最反對的。在上歷史課的時候，先生要呌他硬記歷史上許多年代，和不很重要的人名地名，他每决都是毅然反對不肯去記的，在他只感到這樣讀書不但無補於識見，反徒然地把腦子弄壞，太無意義了。對於敎科書他是不十二分注意的，倘使是他性情相近的功課，那麼他就特別地加意努力，再三年卒讀到眞正懂了才肯釋卷。常五十四歲那年，他在一個商業學校畢了業，接着就到都伯林地產公司當職員。决年，有二個美國的傳敎士到都伯林地方來傳敎，蕭伯納知道了這消息，便激起了他那反抗的心：於是他帶了一封公開的信，發表在當地的報紙上，這信里的大意是反對迷信的話，並且說明天下沒有「神」這樣東西的存在的。此信給當地思想陳舊的人看到了，都覺得十二分奇駭，他們都非常憤恨，說蕭伯納是宗敎的叛逆者。</p>
<p>當蕭伯納二十歲那年，他的母親决定到倫敦去謀生他只好跟着母淸一齊跑。他們这次的舉動確實太危險了，因為在偌大的倫敦他們沒有一個熟人，隨身的費用又少，但是這賢良有為的母親，仍然不怕這些艱難，迎頭向這個社會奮鬥。在不久以後，果然找到了一個可以自立的職業，那時的蕭伯納一天到晚都努力閱讀文學書，無疑的，他的終身默給文學的决心，在那時已决定了的。在倫敦最初三年，他在商店里代人記帳，可是一有機會，他無刻不在那里對着文學下苦功的。有暇就到圖書館里去看書，或參加各種社會活動，因為他對於社會的情形十分洞悉，倘使你想作一個文學家，而對於社會的情形是茫然無覩的話，那麼你是决不會寫出偉大的作品來的</p>
<p>雖然蕭伯納寫了不少的小說；向各方去投稿，可是都遭了編輯先生的白眼，都被塞到字紙簍里去了。然而他一些都沒有灰心，反以更大的努力，對文學下功夫。</p>
<p>當他回憶起稿子被編辑先生拒絕的情形，他說，「人生如戰事一樣，你在不和會奮鬥的時候如果不能鼓起勇氣，堅持到底，那麼你就會被他所敗退。倘使以一時的失敗，而我把我的企望和决心鬆懈下來，那麼，我决不會在文壇上有現在的地位的」。</p>
<p>在他二十六時，美國的社會主義者喬治，亨利到倫敦去演講，這位慣參與社會活動的蕭伯納，也是出席的，他聽了亨利的演講之後，心里就大大地被感動了；過了二年，他團結了幾個知己，他們的思想是一致的，於是組織了一個拯救與改造社會的團體。這團體中的分子，都是當時有名的學者，他們目覩世事的不平，於是他們想徙事改造社會。他們的主張是緩和的，逐漸使互相仇視的人們，都去設法聯絡合作。蕭伯納在這團體中幹過不少有為的事，所以他不但是一個文學家，還是一個社會的改造家在那時他是做過不少的批評工作。可是在三十七歲以前，仍然還是一個平凡的人，在社會上還是與以前一樣沒有地位可是就在三十七歲那年，發表了一篇華倫夫人的職業一劇，轟動了全歐的文壇，英國的各大戲院，都爭先恐後的排演。上演的時候，眞是人山人海，擁擠非常，而且得到觀衆的拍掌喝彩的。從此樹立了蕭伯納在文壇上的大名。此後他又寫了不少劇本，都是非常有名的。在一九二六年獲得諾貝爾的文學獎金，從此以後，世人都承認他是一個偉大的戲劇家了。是的，天下沒有白費心力的事，你有一分努力總有一分成功，蕭伯納能促困苦難中，舊門，才有今日的成功，这次不是僥倖的獲得，都是應有的報酬。</p>

<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>英C．白朗底女士作　李霽野譯　生活書店世界文庫出版</p>
<p>這樣一來，羅契司特爾，犯了重婚罪，欺騙了無辜而純潔的少女簡愛了。環境逼迫羅契司特爾不得不宣布眞象，原來住在桑恩費爾得府邸樓頂上的瘋婦人，便是他的正式夫人。他以前受了騙，不由自主地和瘋症未發作的白沙安東尼塔馬遜結婚。屢决想殺害羅契司特爾，並且曾咬傷過她的哥哥理查得馬遜的，不是別人，就是羅契司特爾的正式夫人馬遜幹出來的。這些都是桑恩費爾得府邸中的大秘密，均由簡愛莫明其妙地親身經歷過來的。布里幾一干人等因此特地去參觀了一次那猛獸似的瘋婦人，她在當塲還和羅契司特爾搏鬥了一次。</p>
<p>白沙安東尼塔馬遜之瘋，原是遺傳，她還有一個弟弟完全是一個啞白痴。但是她的父親是西印度羣島的開墾人和大富商。羅契司特爾的父親和哥哥，圖得大富商女兒三萬鎊的妝奩，把這種不幸的婚姻促成了。起初她並不瘋，直到和羅契司特爾結婚之後纔瘋了的，瘋了以後，使一直被禁錮到桑恩費爾得的三層樓上，已經十年之久了。出了很大的代價，雇了一個專看守她的女僕葛來司波兒，並特約個醫生加特爾防備臨時的變故。</p>
<p>自從這秘密揭穿了，簡愛受不了道樣大的刺激，並目不能眼見人家已有夫人而自已還甘心作人家的情婦，於是出走了。</p>
<p>一個人昏昏沉沉地偷別了桑恩費爾得府邸，芷是天剛黎明的時候，上了一輛不知上那兒去的客車，付了車夫自己身上僅有的二十先令，便被載到一個很遠很遠的路口名呌做惠特克勞司的地方下了車，又把隨身帶的一小包衣裳失掉，失神落魄地她摸到一個小市鎮上，想求一小職業，甚至想找一個僕人的位置，終於都被拒絕了。她無可奈何，只有求乞，只有露宿的分兒了。</p>
<p>有一天夜裏大雨，她摸近一個名呌澤地房鄉村的屋邊，她從窗外看見裏面有兩個少女在讀書，她敲門求乞，又被一個老婦人拒絕了，她在飢寒交逼之下，便在門口昏倒了，等到該宅的男主人從外面歸來，發現了這個垂死的丐女，他喚屋裏面的女人一同出來拯救她，幸喜因為湯食的灌喂，她醒過來，少女又把溫柔的牀舖讓給她，將息了幾天之後，她完全好了。</p>
<p>屋主人名呌聖的翰，里弗爾司，是一做牧師，他有兩個妹妹，個名瑪利，一個名狄安那，還有一個老女僕名漢那。他們盤問她的身世，她保守着秘密，改了一個名字呌簡以利阿特JaneElliott，只吿訴她們在羅沃德學校的歷史，而把桑恩費爾得的經過隱瞞起來。</p>
<p>她和聖約翰一家在澤地房住了一些時候，彼此談得十分相得，她請求聖約翰替她介紹一個職業，以便獨立生活，那怕是做女工做看護做僕人都可以。後來聖的翰在他的敎區內，介紹她去當一個茅屋小學的女校長，她自然很高興地担任下來。小學的經費是山谷裏針廠和鑄造廠主阿立夫供給，他底獨生女兒阿立夫小姐也會教過書，現在她沒有工夫，便聘請簡愛了。聖約翰和阿立夫小姐已有相當的愛情，可是獻身給敎會的聖約翰，認為富有的阿立夫小姐不是他理想的配偶。</p>
<p>聖的翰要偕同漢那去做牧師的職務，狄安那和瑪利都在英格蘭南部時髦的城市中作保姆，因為窮乏的關係，大家不得不各奔前程，於是澤地房的房子也不得不關鎖起來，雖然彼此都覺得依戀不捨，有許多黯然魂銷的神情。</p>
<p>在茅屋小學，她和阿立夫小姐晤見了，並且做了好朋友，替阿立夫小姐美麗的容貌作了一次寫生這藝術天才使得阿立夫小姐吃驚，不久，聖約翰到校時也看見了</p>
<p>阿立夫小姐生得很美，聖約翰也長得很俊俏，本是天生一對佳耦，可惜因為貧富階級的關係，無形中有一種阻碍，並且聖的翰要實現他神聖的理想事業，到印度去傳道，他覺得只有見解有毅力有靈敏頭腦的簡愛，才是他唯一合格的助手。</p>
<p>有一天夜深，聖約翰來了，他向簡愛揭發簡愛所有一切過去的歷史，（因為他得到布里幾律師的函件。）並且吿訴她她巳是有二萬鎊遣產的富人了。這遺產富然是她叔父愛先生臨死遺囑上指定給她的。簡愛驚喜之餘，立卽主張把兩萬鎊分開，聖約翰，狄安那，瑪利和她自己，各得四分之一—五千鎊。</p>
<p>至於布里幾律師為什麽向聖約翰為出關與簡愛母親呢？原來聖約翰的愛姓的事，正是簡愛父親的妹妹，大酒商愛先生，是簡愛的叔父，也就是聖的翰的舅父了，　愛和聖約翰狄安那瑪利三乃是姑表之親，大家彼此不相識，却又在無意之中遇見了。</p>
<p>布里幾律師是愛先生的律師，寫信吿訴聖的翰說他的舅父愛先生死了，把財產留給他哥哥底孤女，幾星期以後又寫信來，說到女承繼人不知下落，問的翰是否知道她的消息。他無意中從畫上以及一片紙上發現了簡愛的眞名，他才知道「以利阿特」是假託的名字了。</p>
<p>這一切眞象明白了之後，休假的季節快到了，她先期回到澤地房，洗刷整理舊房子，佈置得十分妥貼，專候狄安那和瑪利回來，大家快樂享受這個假期。在假期中它們的快樂常然比較以前增加百倍，因為它們都不是一無所有的窮人了。</p>

<p>經過許許多多的學者研究　於政府獎勵之下始發明最新療法</p>
<p>對於淋病之措選、古今來不知經過多少學者之研究，費盡幾許心血，而其切實有效之療法，方克達到真正成功。此即今日治淋上最有價值『Reiztberapie』（刺激療法）之應用，亦此療法之內服製劑「克淋儂」之廣被採行是也。</p>
<p>在刺激療法未發明之前，許多學者，莫不彈心竭慮，惟日孜孜，埋頭於書堆及化騐室。病室之中，其初有所謂淋病透膜殺菌療法，蓋以藥物清利尿道，而使尿道粘膜上之淋菌：漸歸消減，一時大見風行。但因淋毒並不僅潛居於尿道粘膜，週身及血液莫不有其蹤跡，觀於淋毒性關節炎之菌體分　於骨節可知。故局部之透膜殺菌，終告失敗。學者於失望之下，乃以『失敗為成功之母』一語相勗，更加精心研究，又得各政府創立專門研究機關，獎勵備至，卒有Buchner　u　Romer教授『Reiztherapie』之發明，各國學者，均交口稱譽。惟此療法僅為一種理論，尚未能見諸實用，於是由德人Biedel博士，根據其理論以蛋白體侶配提凈之色素，創製為淋病內服藥「克淋儂」，從此世界權威學者。競爭其研究之業。一致採用，淋病治療上，逐開一新境地，而醫學界頓起一巨大波紋！迭經Bertin　Ｒonnefeld　Mirakjane諸著名學者臨床實騐，確證毫無毒性，性質王道，余在俄國實習時即已採用，以治一切急慢男女白濁白帶，極為有效，約服五六瓶至八九瓶，即可全部根治，永不復發。對於婦女淋毒白帶，除服「克淋儂」外，並用「卡而雪地」為陰道坐藥。而男之攝護腺炎，睾丸炎以及淋病合併症關節炎等，服「克淋儂」均有特殊功能。</p>

<p>— 前南洋醫科大學教授鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>診所：寗波路四川路口　診時：下午四時至六時</p>
<p>肺癆患者，為都市上最多之疾患，每年中死於此症者，不知凡幾。余往時醫治本病，其轉歸良好者不過十之三四，餘則多係不治。及採用Calcium製劑以來，漸收良好之治續。惟其注射至少須數十次，患者每厭其煩苦。自徒梅博士「補肺拿爾」之內服劑行於世，余即取以試騐於多數肺癆病之患者，皆獲奏確實之功效。且藥性純良，萬無流弊。茲述騐案於后。</p>
<p>第一例：肺癆。患沈夢飛君，二十六歲，學界。</p>
<p>症狀：咳嗽有些痰，經調治後，痰略少，約二月餘復來劇烈咳嗽。日暮有微熱，食思缺損。胸痛，盜汗。失眠，暈眩耳鳴，心跳，頻發遣精，腰痛。體重銳减。</p>
<p>診療：診係肺尖結核，打診聽診有空洞音。經投服「補肺拿爾」以殺菌除澇，並令服「補體康」以挽救衰弱，（婦女可服）「補女容」調經健體。）同時再服「耐而斯遺精片」以治遺精。各服二瓶，咯血頓止，虛象盡除。繼服數瓶，體重增加，精神暢適，面色紅潤可喜云。第二例：哮喘。患者社英齡君，年四十七，商界。</p>
<p>症狀：平日痰多，作白色泡沫狀。春冬兩季，時發氣喘，喘時呼吸困難，面色青白。不能平臥。近日忽大發舊疾，喘氣心悸，食物减少，痰涎潮湧，頭眩眼花。</p>
<p>診療：診係心臟性喘息症。宜服「補肺傘爾」以寗心平喘，舒展氣管痙攣而化除痰液，效力大著。乃以此藥與「補體康」同時進服，鎮懾其肺部而旺盛其體力，連治月許，卽臻全部治愈云。</p>

<p>胡思亂想，艶夢頻來。</p>
<p>害單相思的人所最苦惱的遺精。</p>
<p>夢精者，即有夢遺精之謂。其因甚多，或由於手淫，或房事過多，致起神經系統之刺戟性衰弱，陷入生殖器性神經衰弱症。因手淫，过度房事不绝亢奋其神经系统之反應作用，逐發生勃起及射精中樞之感動性刺激，而來夢中射精症。故猥亵之談話，文章，繪畫等，每招致夜間勃及夢精。</p>
<p>患遺精者以害單戀者為多，因其胡思亂想，易於刺戟神經也。其他先天下不足，性神經衰弱者，均患本症。亦有無夢遺精者，此則輸精管弛鬆，故大小便及用力時精液漏等。更甚則有陽痿，勃起不壯，精神恍惚，健忘，失眠，瘦弱等症</p>
<p>療法方面，遺精症當然以服「耐用斯遺精片」為主。因「耐用精片」有　固精管及鎮攝神經之衛效。又能减除刺激，故服後手淫自戒，服本劑對於夢精，精漏，滑精等，皆可根本治愈。但同時最好以兼服「補體康」挽回其衰弱，增加其性能為佳。約服二星期至四星期即可全效！</p>

<p>淋病失治之痛苦</p>
<p>淋病在急性期間，固然十分痛苦，然茍能在此痛苦期間予以迅速徹底之根治，則此痛苦之時間甚短，惟一旦失却急性期治愈之機會，此淋病每易傳染異性，向之痛苦，僅及一身，而今則二人受害矣。故其危險，較諸急性更覺重大。</p>
<p>如不幸男女雙方皆為淋毒所困，自不得不急行適當醫治。有住小沙渡路之黎天拔君，年廿五歲，混前已患淋病，雖不斷的醫治，俱未奏功，睾丸腫痛化硬，小便難濟，淋系中混有膿血球，射精困難，會陰肛門牽引作痛。嗣因向大東書局購讀余之「性病全書」，知睾丸炎有不孕危險，即來余處診治，乃為之施用X線及電氣療法，更內服「克淋儂」以殺菌除炎而清血液中之餘毒，使睾丸恢復原有之生殖力。連服四星期後，睾丸腫退，尿液清瑩，惟用願微鏡檢查後，尚有少許淋系膿球，　其續服「克淋儂」至十餘天，淋系膿血始見絕跡，復用血清檢查至六七次，迄無一次有淋菌發見，逐證明根治，黎君不勝忭喜。復告余謂其夫人染淋毒性白帶甚烈，局部受膿毒的刺戟，故糜爛而痛，甚則防害小便，乞余介紹良藥，乃囑其內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，內外兼治，淋帶俱清，於四星期中完全根治，夫婦皆大歡喜，向余稱謝而去。雖然，黎君之病茍能及時治愈，决不致有若斯痛苦也。</p>

<p>— 日本帝大醫科陳宗堃醫師</p>
<p>最適當　　　　過於鐵器療治</p>
<p>生殖力之消失，多由於青春期濫施手淫，致生殖腺發育機能，半途中止，而生殖腺系與腦之智力，亦頗有關係，故生殖力之减弱者，其智力亦無不　减，故發育不全，遺精早淺陽痿之患者，每有記憶力衰弱，思想遲鈍，遇事舛誤等，此生殖機能障礙後　見之證據。</p>
<p>關於此病之治療，以荷爾蒙製劑最為有效。但此等內分泌法，對於原料與製法，各家不用，而荷爾蒙之種類，亦殊夥願。往往一國有數十種之內分泌製劑，而其圓滿效果，初不多見。惟德國梅倫氏發明之男用「補體康」，女傭「補女容」二藥，功效最著，余　在日本帝國大學醫科時，已後柏林某雜誌上，有詳記研究此藥功效，及動物試驗，確證明「補體康」效果之正確與實全，為任何內分泌製劑所不及。返國後，即從臨床上之實驗，「補體康」一藥功效果十分正確，宜始終為世界各大醫家，競相採用也。因此二藥－「補體康」，「補女容」。久已風行　球，殊非偶然。考二藥發明者，早已經動物試驗多時，結果竟獲　異之結果，因而逐漸精益求精，不斷研究，前後費時三十餘載始底於成。對於因手淫而來之生殖力，智力銳减者，服後有積極矯除之良效。</p>

<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>婦女白帶，恒常年不絕，日漸浸淫，致　道陰門等處，由發炎紅腫而糜爛，因而障礙其排尿與房事時之痛苦。更怕此而引起月經困難，少腹膨脹考婦女白帶病之來源甚多。有因先天卵巢發育不足，及身體虛弱而來者，有因機械的刺戟，如粗暴之房事與手淫，致　粘膜破損而來者。有因淋毒傳染而來者。總之能成女子白帶病之原因雖多，而大略不外上列三大原則。</p>
<p>故施治之方，亦以防腐殺菌，及矯正先天發育不全與強身補體等為跟治之原則。據吾人多年來臨床上之實騐，凡有白帶病之婦，慨可用德國「卡而想雪地氏陰道片」為插入陰道，晨次洗去既得。如因卵巢發育不全，身體虛弱者，可兼服「補女容」，因淋毒傳染者，可兼服「克淋儂」，表裏兼治，則奏效尤速。「卡氏陰道片」具有防腐殺菌鎮痛之效，但毫無一般坐藥之有刺戟性。故每個婦女，均可依次在家應用自療，絕無流弊。</p>

<p>噯氣吞酸，見食生長。愁眉不展，原因為了便秘。今日世界聞名，人類之腦部，運用愈力，因思慮結果，胃部機能往往為之减退，故胃病已威為文明病之一。胃病之初步，即食慾减衰，胸膈飽悶，腹部作脹作痛。此多見于招凉及飲食不節之後，若不急治，即轉為慢性。而來噯氣，吐酸，翻嘔，嘈雜等。據余臨床實騐，以強胃為其主要治療，故宜大量進服「強胃精」一藥，昂盛胃機能，促增胃納，則食慾重振，而各種胃症，於焉廖愈，撥雲霧而見青天，永臻康強矣。</p>
<p>胃病之影響，第一步卽為腸作用之障碍，而有大便秘結，洩痢，多屁等症，「强胃精」以其内含　　之酵酶，有减除　酵，及亢奮腸機能之殊效，故大便失常及多屁症，服「强胃精」即可全治。</p>
<p>凡晨起多睡，口臭，食少身瘦，可服「强胃精」改造其消化機能，則營養佳良，口臭多唾自除。最好與男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」同時並服，以旺盛體力，則收效尤速，而獲身壯體健，精神煥發。「強胃精」又含大量維他命B，善治因缺乏維他命B而來之腳氣腳脹。性格純良，毫無流弊。</p>

<h3 id="c202">「使英雄氣短」 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>平社會局在禁演「風波亭」和「走麥城」了，罪名據說是「使英雄氣短」。</p>
<p>對平劇的知識我是缺乏得很的，但這兩齣戲我却都看過，大槪由於並非「英雄」，所以倒也並沒「氣短」，反之，我却更威到關岳的可敬可愛：他們的確像個「英雄」，至死不屈。</p>
<p>平劇的觀點不大正確，那是實情。但牠的短處可並不是「使英雄氣短」，而是封建的鼓吹愚忠愚孝以及什麼「節」「烈」之類，卽使有「使英雄氣短」的戲吧，也决不是「風波亭」或「走麥城」。</p>
<p>「風波亭」和「走麥城」這兩齣戲的故事，一般人大槪是都知道的，這兒用不到談：這兩位「英雄」的死因雖不同，一個死於抗敵失敗，不屈被殺，一個被漢奸陷害，以致不能「痛飲黃龍」然而這兩位「英雄」的使我這個平凡的人的崇拜，却是一樣的。我們用現時代的眼光來批判關岳，固然有可指摘的地方，不過我對「將軍應死於陣上，不該死在牀上」的俗語却是絕對信服的，以這樣的槪念去衡量關岳，我覺得關岳並不愧對「英雄」這兩個字。</p>
<p>至於說看了「走麥城」和「風波亭」之後，會「使英雄氣短」，這大槪是「現代的英雄」看法，像並非是「英雄」的我看來，則祗覺得關岳的死得其所，一個「英雄」如果不幸眞遇到這樣的情形，那麼這樣的死也眞是所謂「重於泰山」的死了。當然，能够不遇到這樣的不幸，能够更有意義的活下去是更好，但要是遇到了，到也是「光榮」，並不怎樣「氣短」的。</p>
<p>不久之前北方有位姓蕭的老太太做壽，堂會據說很熱鬧，全國的幾個紅角兒，差不多全到齊了；最近，二十九軍聽說也專邀了一次富連成班；這兩决的演戲，都在平社會局明令禁北以前，不知道戲目中「風波亭」和「走麥城」有沒有列入？但以意測之，該兩戲旣要「使英雄氣短」，想來當在避諱之列了，但不該「使英雄氣短」的戲又演什麼呢？那大槪是專演「兒女情長」如「小放牛」，「寳蟾送酒」之類吧？那些戲旣不觸眼，又是頗合「娛樂」之道的。再不然，以為打哈哈的戲太少骨子，以「英雄」來看，有失尊嚴，那麼大槪演一些儒雅風流的「梅龍鎭」或是「紅鬆烈馬」這一些，這些戲，旣顯得儒雅風流，又頗有「做老大哥可」的權威，旗開得勝，馬到成功，豈不「長自已威風」之至。</p>
<h3 id="c203">「祖國」觀後 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>和我們小別了三月的「中旅」，現在又重回到上海來了，這一次除保持了一個「雷雨」之外，共他的沒有意義的所謂「技術上的樣品」，據說將一槪放棄，這種毅然决然的决斷，在民族阽危，國難日深的現在，原是每個有良心的藝人所應該有的。而陳綿先生譯作兼導演的「祖國」，便是這新的起點中的第一個戲。（我希望這個觀察並沒錯，換一句話說，就是「中旅」已在「埋葬過去的一切，以展開新的將來」中。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>嚴格的說起來，「袓國」自然儘有可商榷的地方，但是我們如果把「中旅」來一下縱的觀察，則我敢說；「祖國」是「中旅」所演出的諸戲中一個最有意義的戲，套一句唐機秋先生的話，則「祖國」在「中旅」的諸戲中，是最接近「不離開時代不離開大風的。</p>
<p>自然，正因為它的有意義，我們除表示欽敬之外，將更嚴格的來檢討「祖國」中的弱點。</p>
<p>首先，我要提出來和陳綿先生商榷的，是分幕方面的。以我淺陋的經騐來說，我所看過的戲劇中，是以「祖國」的幕數及最多的，因為幕數多，佈景，服裝道具等也不能不多，這是顯見的事實，這於經濟能力還很薄弱的中國戲劇界，似乎是不甚相宜，其次，因為每幕的背景不同，而每幕下來的拆卸裝置等等又得費很多的時光，這於時間上似乎也太小經濟，以試演這一次來說，從開幕到閉幕，差不多演了五個小時之久，台上的工作人員一定很吃力，固然不待說，而於觀衆，也實在覺得戲的太長。</p>
<p>以「袓國」的本身來說呢，我覺得其中也儘有好幾幕是可以删去的，例如第三幕的「城外」，和第七幕的「街道」，祗要於別的一幕上加幾句對白，便不難交代淸楚，其决如第二幕，如果好好地和別幕歸併一下，我想也不難把它删除吧？而像第三第七幕的佈景，何况根本就不容易討好的呢。</p>
<p>一個好戲的演出，如果必要把它去法存精的改動一下子，我以為並不是件要不得的事情。</p>
<p>「祖國」中的佛拉芒國，很有些像現在我們的「祖國」，觀衆為台上的愛國者的熱忱所感動，回頭再看看我們自己，因而不忍立刻走開，我以為這是使觀衆不「抽籤」的最眞實的原因，但我們却不能就此就認為滿足，同時我相信，如果我們好好地把它删動一下，使得「祖國」更緊凑些，它的威動力一定會更大的。試演的時候，一般的觀衆都是受過很高的敎育的智識份子，他們對於戲劇的理解當然較之於普通的觀衆要高出一些，因而我們為　　的衆衆着想，便應該顧到他們欣賞的水凖，在經了一個很長的時間，如果中間有一幕突然鬆懈下來，這將會造成怎樣的效果，這實在是頗使我「杞憂，的，「雷雨」的能賣座，並且他演出的時間在四小時以上不使觀衆散去者，我以為實在是由於編寫得緊凑的緣故。</p>
<p>並且「祖國」的上演，那還祗是「中旅」新的起點，如果因為形式上的不够而賣座並不怎樣好，這將會使某種人振振有詞的作為「意識戲」（市上有這麼一個奇怪的稱謂）不賣錢的絕好證據的，並且，於「中旅」的經濟方面來說，這樣的事情當然也不希望有。</p>
<p>一個好的戲，不僅該有好的內容，並且應該有好的形式來統一的地配合它：過去的有些有很好的內容的戲的不賣座，使得某種人任意侮蔑者，便因為是這個綠故。</p>
<p>至於祖國的內容，一般的說來是可以說是很好的，然而，把敵人看得太低，以為他們都是昏蛋，那是會使觀衆造成輕敵的心理的，事實上，敵人不僅不糊塗，並且說不定還精明過我們。而一個愛國者的釋放，居然托福於慈悲為懷的敵軍元帥的女兒，而那元帥又居然會抝不過女兒，這未免是太過於美妙的理想。</p>
<p>關於導演方面的，說來話長，這兒的篇幅不允許我多談，還是從略，留待下决有機會再談吧，後面，我想很簡單的說說其他方面的。</p>
<p>舞臺裝置和照明，原是「中旅」的特長，這兒也不壞除了第二幕的野景和第七幕的街道根木就難討好的之外。尤其是第一幕，照明很使人發生好感，不過第八幕的窗外，先前似乎應該有些光亮，然後再轉為紅光，那樣一定更能使觀衆感到眞實些，而减少突然的威覺。</p>
<p>大槪　為是預演，演員的臺詞和動作都有些兒生。</p>
<p>唐若靑的嗓子已比先　好多了，唸詞上能够再好好地注意一下，成績一定還不至此的，於「祖國」的全體演員中，她是演技最好的一個</p>
<p>總之　這是「中旅」現有的戲中最好的一個　我敢的　　諸我們這樣介紹</p>
<h3 id="c204">啞子 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>「爹，可壞了，咱們高粱地裏有個「倒臥」（病屍）。」</p>
<p>老頭子猛一下把鋤丟到地上，翻着兩隻無神的死魚眼睛。</p>
<p>「什麼，走走走，嗯，他媽……就是你會找麻煩。」</p>
<p>「我怎麼，萬一要死了呢，那不……」</p>
<p>「說破話，死了呌你償命！」</p>
<p>父子倆氣虎虎的走到那裏時，那赤條條約人已爬到豆秧叢里藏了。他們倆弓着身子走進去，那人正爬在綠油油的葉子底下，摘了一把靑嫩的豆筴在吃，老傢伙心痛得更有些急了，走過去便踢了一脚，駡着：</p>
<p>「你個坑人種，給我滾！」</p>
<p>那人哦哦地像個鴨子呌，把手指指嘴，又擺一擺手，「誰跟你買牲口？還打手式！」老頭子氣憤的駡着，又要踢，兒子一邊用手擋住，一面說：</p>
<p>「是個啞巴，你跟發脾氣也沒用。」</p>
<p>「來！架出他去！」</p>
<p>兩個人各揑住一隻胳膊，啞子便呵呵地喊呌着哭了起來，一面搖幌着腦袋，一面用力爬着不動，老頭子氣很瞪着眼，他痛愛那些給壓倒了的豆秧，他又恨為什麼這討賬鬼單選他的地，哼了聲，一步跨到啞子身上，像騎馬似的，兩隻手一直伸到下面那人的胳肢窩里，猛用力向上一提，啞子像狼號般吼了一聲，給跪了起來，年輕小夥子驚得痴呆呆的，等看見那啞子一雙下垂的大乳房，他便用着哭聲呌：</p>
<p>「爹，別動，是個娘兒們！」</p>
<p>老人也頹喪的呵了聲，感到晦氣的抽回身來。</p>
<p>兩個同時蹲下，煩燥的看着那伏在泥土里的女人，這時河坡的小路上有人喚着：</p>
<p>「小丕子，小丕子，送了飯來了！」</p>
<p>年靑人高音的答應了聲，那個掛着一只大柳籃的老婦人，隨着音聲走了過來，她驚奇的看着橛着個鬍子嘴的丈夫，直勾勾瞅着豆葉叢里的兒子，她放下籃，將一小盆稀飯也挪下，豆叢里息率的響動了一陣，接着哦哦吼着，重又探出一個蓬鬆的頭來。老婦人嚇得一動也不敢動的說：</p>
<p>「怎麼回事？」</p>
<p>「一個光屁股啞巴娘兒們，你看怎麼辦？」</p>
<p>老婆婆剛走到啞子面前，她就又哦哦地呌喚着，一把抓緊老婦人的褲脚，用死力的向下拖，她兩個人互相掙扎着，直到老頭子走去再把他老婆拉回來。</p>
<p>老婦人定了定神說：</p>
<p>「她光赤里的，怕見男人哪，」老農人眯細着眼睛，斜看了豆業里一下：</p>
<p>「誰有褲子給她穿哪！」</p>
<p>「要呌地保送走她，村長知道了，我們那不更多化錢？」</p>
<p>老人把肩膀上的破藍布褂子遞給老婆說「給她圍着送到馬家樹林里去吧。」回頭又令兒子提着飯籃，自己捧着稀飯罐子，穿過嘩拉嘩拉響着的高梁杆，走到玉蜀黍地里，扭轉頭嚷着：</p>
<p>「送她到那邊，拿回小褂來呀眞晦氣……」</p>

<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>宏興烟兌店老板回絕了一個買××牌香烟的主顧，「婦道家不懂事一馬上從喉頭輕輕地滾了出來。現在市面頗流行××牌香烟，宏興烟兌店每天就有不少顧客來買這個牌子的。但是老板看到櫃橱里祗有幾種最起碼的香烟靜悄悄地躺着，就用自家拳頭打着自家的手掌嚕咕他的老妻：「婦道家不懂事，放着好生意不做，把洋鈿藏起來看你打金棺材銀廓」。</p>
<p>宏興烟兌店開在並不熟鬧的小街上，烟兌店營業倒還是靠着蘇廣雜貨，老板娘是精明的女人，自然不肯批購高價的××牌來應付僅有的幾個顧客。老板一咕嚕，老板娘馬上跳了起來；「這末一把年紀了，做生意都沒有門檻，有幾個人吃得起××牌！火油要漲價了，還不曉得早點批幾箱放着。」</p>
<p>老板是懼內的，心裏雖然不服氣上門的生意放走，火油有三大箱放在店裏再批來做什麼？對老婆橫了一眼就認為精神勝利了走出櫃臺口來。在他們夫妻嚕咕的時侯有一封信丟在店堂的地板上，老板拾起來看淸楚了上面劉才福三個大字，才另外找着了題目：「會期又要到了，不多做一點生意，節上看你開銷？」一邊高聲喊他的兒子：「福生，來看看信上寫着什麼話？」</p>
<p>老板把信箋抽了出來，但是裏面也有劉才福三個字外，他不認識什麼了。</p>
<p>福生從店堂內室踅了出來，他已經聽慣了老夫妻倆個的伴嘴，而且每决結局都是把福生東扯西駡一頓了事。他呆呆地站在父親面前，接過那封信來，一面橫着眼角瞟他母親的嘴臉。</p>
<p>「要開學了，學校裏來的通知書」。</p>
<p>「看吧！」老板又抓着了一個題目：「又是要錢，又是要錢！」</p>
<p>老板娘正打着算盤，她算着批幾箱火油進來倒底合算不合算。但是老板娘的珠算並不高明，十三擋算珠似乎還不够她支配，肚裏記着存着的三箱火油好賣多少日子，算珠上却打着批火油的本錢可生多少利息，被老板要錢要錢一鬧，肚裏的數目和算盤上的珠子都擾糢糊了，於是把算盤一摔，衝到老板面前：（未完）</p>

<p>波塘水漲泊漁舫。垂柳毶毶　萬條。侵曉但聞駕喚夢。俏漁婆忙把被輕拋。他是，身軀瘦削慵抬起。他是，倦眼迷離怕細瞧。他是，呵欠懶伸鸞藕臂。他是，布襟收拾屈纖腰。但見他，銅盆蓬窗撐竹篙。但見他，檢取衣衫添半臂。但見他，鏡奩輕啟畫眉梢。又見他，春雲一綹把鶯梳掠。鬢綰靈蛇式樣嬌。紛盒揭開雙手彙。脂痕微抹點櫻桃臨波迥照驚鴻影。更把那，柳炭雙蛾仔細描。說不盡，體態風流嬌模樣。令人一見要魂消。漁婆妝罷收奩員。結綱船梢把手招。忽聽得。一聲欵乃櫓輕搖。</p>

<p>多情却是總痴情。薄命紅顏自古云。我專仙，幼失椿萱無依靠。伶仃飬媳　陸門。姑　訂婚原屬義。家歡樂度先陰。更表見情亦重。喃喃小語話溫存。恨只恨，尼僧不　貪募化。悔只悔，婉詞諫阻結仇深。釵頭鳳，碎落豈有意。惹出非常福不輕。播弄無非圖報復。世間可段是尼僧。讒言進母將奴害。萬苦千辛委屈求。姑怒不消心更變。竟使我，空門獨處受欺凌。惡尼賤羣會誘到。為守貞操誓不遵。良人何知遠赴試。愁腸萬　向誰評。郎雖歸來幸見面。益悲傷，連花并蒡已揮成，可憐我，得賦斷腸豈忍讀。可憐我，淚珠點點濕羅襟。可憐我，思則想後難入夢。可憐我，反　終宵睡不宵。可憐我，憔悴容顏怕對鏡。可憐我，　綿床　病成真。可憐我，鯤絃應續　叮嚀。可憐我。絕而復　婆婆喚。不能定省侍　昏。願姑且把愁　展。須恕媳婦不孝名。自歡孽緣宿世定。折磨何必怨他人。只望蒼天知我意。人生　散本浮萍。甘心瞑目世兩冥。</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Chairman Chiang attended the Premier's Revolutionary Memorial Meeting in Guangzhou on the morning of the 9th and spoke about the revival of China: (1) The historical background of the Premier's advocacy of revolution, the severity of foreign aggression, and the corruption of the Qing Dynasty; (2) The "Manifesto of the Revive China Society" is the fundamental righteousness of the Chinese revolution; (3) In commemorating the first revolution, we should promote the revolutionary spirit of the Premier and the martyrs, unite sincerely, and face the national crisis together; (4) Today is the most crucial moment for the success or failure of the revolution and the rise or fall of the nation. I hope that all comrades and compatriots across the country will fulfill their responsibilities for revolution and nation-building. Chairman, fellow comrades, today is the memorial day of the Premier's first revolution. The Chairman has just reported the significance of the commemoration in detail. Now, I would like to further clarify the historical background of why the Premier launched the revolution. Forty-one years ago today, on September 9th of the year Yiwu, the Premier led Lu Haodong, Cheng Kuiguang, and other martyrs to launch an uprising in Guangdong, initiating the first armed revolutionary movement of our party. How did this revolution happen? Why did the Premier launch the revolutionary movement at that time? To answer this question, we must understand the historical background of the revolution at that time. As everyone knows, there was the Sino-Japanese War in the year Jiawu, one year before the Yiwu uprising. China was defeated and suffered great losses. The Chinese nation suffered unprecedented humiliation. By this point, the incompetence and corruption of the Manchu Qing government and the greed and ignorance of the local officials were fully exposed. In particular, the suffering of the general public under the dark and evil rule of foreign ethnicities had reached the point of unbearable suffering. Originally, the Premier had already resolved to make revolution after the Sino-French War in the year Yiyou. Three years before Yiwu, that is, in the year Renchen, he had already organized the Revive China Society with many comrades. After the defeat in the Jiawu War, he saw the critical situation of the country's survival and the suffering of the people who were being exploited and devastated. He felt even more that an armed revolution must be carried out as soon as possible to overthrow the Manchu Qing and restore China. He also saw that at the time, all people of insight in the country hated the Manchu Qing government's evil corruption, felt the shame and danger of the nation and the ethnicity, and the revolutionary mood of the general revolutionary comrades, in deep sorrow, was already boiling. Therefore, the revolutionary movement advocated by the Premier, due to the intensity of the situation, progressed from propaganda and organization to armed action. At that time, the Premier led the comrades, each embracing the determination of "either success or martyrdom," and launched the first great uprising in Guangzhou on this day in the year Yiwu, opening the first page of the great and glorious history of our party's revolution. When we read the words in the Manifesto of the Revive China Society, "The dignified Huaguo is not tolerated among the nations, and the abundant clothing is despised by foreign ethnicities. How can people of insight not feel heartbroken?" we can understand the biggest reason for launching the revolution at that time. Although this revolutionary movement failed due to the secrecy of the opportunity, the highest personality and revolutionary spirit of the Premier and the martyrs who sacrificed for the country and did not compromise in the face of difficulties were enough to encourage mold and create momentum, laying an initial spiritual foundation for the success of the Xinhai Revolution. It left an eternal model of struggle and sacrifice for the revolutionary comrades of our party. This is the greatest success of the Premier's first revolution. Now, in order to enable everyone to deeply understand the background and purpose of the revolution, the organization of the revolutionary group, and the Premier's hope for the general comrades, I would like to take this opportunity to read the Manifesto of the Revive China Society to everyone.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the killing of a Japanese resident in Beihai, Guangdong, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Acting Consul General of Guangdong, Yoshitake, on the 9th. The main contents are as follows: Junzo Nakano (52), a Japanese grocer and pharmacist residing in Beihai, Guangdong Province (originally from Gogo Village, Kita District, Ehime Prefecture), was killed by rioters. This simple telegram was sent to the Guangdong Consulate General on the 8th. Acting Consul General Yoshitake immediately visited Diao Zuqian, Special Commissioner of the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Department, on the afternoon of the 8th to protest orally and in writing, demanding protection. Special Commissioner Diao first expressed his apologies and then stated that a public telegram had been sent to the Provincial Government on the 7th stating that the public in Beihai held a demonstration on the 3rd, and that the rioters killed the Japanese Nakano during the parade. Therefore, Provincial Chairman Huang Musong and Yu Hanmou jointly telegraphed Xu, the liaison officer of the Haikou Buffer Division, to investigate, and at the same time telegraphed Li Zongren to arrest the murderers. Acting Consul General Yoshitake immediately questioned why the incident that occurred on the 3rd was not notified until the 8th, and why the Japanese Consulate General was not notified immediately after receiving the public telegram on the 7th. The Japanese side said that it had to dispatch investigators to the scene of the incident for investigation. Special Commissioner Diao replied that Beihai is currently occupied by Weng Zhaoyuan's troops of the 19th Route Army, so the orders of the provincial government cannot be fully implemented. The details of the incident were not fully explained at the time, and the meeting ended there. Acting Consul General Yoshitake then visited Provincial Chairman Huang Musong and protested seriously, saying that it was regrettable that such an incident occurred when the Chengdu incident had not yet been resolved. Japan would attach importance to the people's movement as it did to the Chengdu incident. Chairman Huang replied that the provincial government had strictly ordered Li Zongren to arrest the murderers, and on the 8th telegraphed to preserve Nakano's body and not to move it, and said that this incident was extremely regrettable, and the Chinese side would not evade responsibility and expressed the apologies of the local officials.

<h3 id="e6">Britain's Declaration on Palestine <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Since the anti-British movement of the Arab nation, which began in Egypt and spread to Palestine, has occurred, it has been almost five months. Recently, the anti-British movement in Egypt has come to an end due to the signing of a new treaty between Egypt and Britain. However, the anti-British movement of the Arab nation continues to grow. Therefore, the British Colonial Office issued a declaration stating that it would dispatch a division of troops to Palestine to suppress the rebellion. Let us analyze the intention of this declaration.</p>
<p>Palestine is located on the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea, closely connected to Port Said, the northern mouth of the Suez Canal, forming a shield for the Suez Canal. Moreover, its port, Haifa, is a naturally good naval port, facing the eastern mouth of the Nile River in Egypt, becoming a key point for controlling the eastern Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is the artery for Britain to reach the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. If its shield—the right to rule Palestine—is lost, Britain's transportation in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean would be greatly threatened. Therefore, after the war, Britain acquired the mandate to rule Palestine from Turkey based on the secret regulations of the British-Russian and British-French agreements of 1916. It used the hatred between Arabs and Jews to consolidate its rule there. It also built air bases in Gaza and Shelafin, opened the port of Haifa, laid an oil pipeline from Mosul, Iraq, to the port of Haifa on the Dead Sea, and built a road from Baghdad to Haifa. These military projects clearly show that Palestine is a must-contested place for Britain to use troops abroad. This is why Britain does not hesitate to send a large army to maintain its rule.</p>
<p>However, the British Colonial Office's declaration also states that it is willing to negotiate with the Arabs to find a way to resolve the disturbances. Why is Britain planning to take peaceful measures? Originally, Britain's aggression against the equatorial Muslim countries is nearing the time of reckoning. The Muslim countries of Southwest Asia, such as Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and Iraq, except for Turkey, are still under British control. However, these countries concluded a mutual defense treaty a few months ago. They see that the Muslims in Palestine are being oppressed by infidels, and they will naturally express considerable sympathy. Britain's excessive oppression of the Arabs will naturally arouse the indignation of Muslim countries. Not only that, but Sudi Arabia is working hard to build a federation that includes all the lands where Arabic-speaking people live in West Asia. This is obviously a major threat to Britain, making it have to be cautious about oppressing the Arab nation.</p>
<p>Britain's declaration on Palestine, on the one hand, indicates that it will send a large army to suppress the anti-British movement of the Arab nation, but on the other hand, it indicates that it is willing to negotiate with the Arabs to find a way to resolve the disturbances. From this, we can see the contradiction in Britain's policy towards Palestine. In this contradictory situation, we can know that the anti-British movement of the Arab nation in Palestine is by no means easy to resolve.</p>

Yamamoto will also visit Song in Ping next week and go to Ji to meet Han before the 15th. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The work of the Hebei-Chahar General Inspection Office is temporarily determined as follows: For all accumulated smuggled goods within the jurisdiction, regardless of type or package, if the owner voluntarily presents them for inspection or if the inspection officers of the office find them, the office will issue an inspection certificate, which will be affixed to each package. The office will then stamp it with the seal of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council Inspection Office, and the owner will pay a handling fee, which will allow them to be sold within the Hebei-Chahar, Pingjin area. The previous rumor of collecting one-eighth of the customs duty is inaccurate, but the fee charged is very small. (Ninth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hebei-Chahar authorities sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance on the 8th and 9th, stating the nature of the establishment of the inspection office and emphasizing that it is only to assist in anti-smuggling.

According to another source, the Hebei-Chahar has in fact implemented the collection of consumption tax, and the financial authorities are properly arranging solutions. Goods that have not yet completed customs duties in the customs and anti-smuggling aspects are still treated as smuggled goods in order to maintain the integrity of the customs system.

<p>(Nanjing) Since China has been affected by the intrusion of foreign commodities, rural areas have become increasingly bankrupt. Moreover, with the recent rise in the living standards of farmers, the decline in commodity prices, and the convenience of transportation facilities, the quantity of commodity imports into rural areas has been increasing day by day. According to the results of reports and surveys from more than 6,000 agricultural reporters in 22 provinces by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, the types, quantities, and proportions of commodity imports into rural areas are as follows: (A) Grains: It seems that the grains produced by ordinary farm households should be sufficient for self-sufficiency and do not need to be purchased from outside. However, according to this decision survey, an average of 35 percent of farm households in 22 provinces need to purchase grains from outside. The reasons for this are partly due to the small area of cultivated land and insufficient production, and partly due to the lack of funds at harvest time, forcing farmers to sell their produced grains urgently and then purchase them again when they are insufficient. Furthermore, the percentages of various purchased grains are: rice accounts for 29 percent, wheat 16.6 percent, flour 9.6 percent, corn 8.9 percent, millet 6.5 percent, and other miscellaneous grains account for a total of 29.4 percent. (B) Clothing: The percentage of farm households purchasing clothing: foreign cloth accounts for 30 percent, silk 7.2 percent, rayon fabrics 8.5 percent, woolen fabrics 9.6 percent, and foreign socks 43 percent. (C) Daily necessities: On average, each middle-class farm household in 22 provinces needs 6.8 catties of foreign sugar, 60.1 catties of salt, 47.2 catties of oil, and 70.2 small boxes of matches per year. In addition, the percentage of farm households purchasing kerosene averages 54.2 percent, with each household needing 27.3 catties of kerosene per year. The percentage of farm households purchasing soap averages 34.1 percent, with each household needing 14 bars of soap per year. These two items are purchased the least by farm households in remote provinces such as Qingning, Gansu, and Guizhou. Furthermore, among the oils used by farm households, rapeseed oil is the most common, accounting for 34 percent of the total oil volume, sesame oil accounts for 19 percent, soybean oil and peanut oil account for 10 percent, and tea oil, cottonseed oil, and other oils account for a combined 37 percent. Furthermore, among the kerosene purchased by farm households, Mobil products are the most common, accounting for 50 percent of the total volume, Asia Petroleum accounts for 19 percent, Texaco accounts for 6 percent, Guanghua Company, originally a Chinese merchant but now incorporated into Mobil and Asia Petroleum, accounts for 4 percent, and others account for 21 percent. (D) Fertilizers, etc.: Among fertilizers, oil cake is purchased by 22 percent of farm households, with Jiangsu Province being the most, followed by Shandong and Hubei provinces, and the least in border provinces such as Qinghai, Gansu, Suiyuan, and Yunnan. Very few farm households purchase fertilizer powder, only 4 percent. Among the agricultural machinery already used by farmers, cotton ginning machines are the most common, accounting for 54 percent, rice milling machines account for 25.8 percent, water lifting machines account for 12.5 percent, and cotton fluffing machines and others account for a combined 7.7 percent. (E) Luxury goods: The percentage of farm households purchasing wine averages 48.8 percent, and the percentage of farm households purchasing cigarettes is 19.3 percent. The percentage of farmers who drink alcohol is 42.3 percent, and the percentage of farmers who smoke cigarettes is 27.7 percent. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e49">The Russian-German Battlefield of Twenty Years Ago: Red Army Conducts Large-Scale Maneuvers with 100,000 Soldiers and 1,000 Aircraft Participating; Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia Send Commissioners to Observe; Underground Buildings, Fortified Defenses, and Mysterious Equipment <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov stated at the opening of the Red Army maneuvers today, "Those nations advocating pacifism are now preparing to attack our motherland. Take note! We are fully prepared to strike them in the back." The location of these maneuvers is on the Polish border, the very place where Russian and German forces clashed fiercely during the Great War. The participants include over 100,000 soldiers and officers, 1,000 tanks, and 1,000 aircraft. The British observation group is headed by Major General Wavell. One item on the training program is a simulated battle for the important city of Minsk. The area of the maneuvers has been meticulously arranged, containing underground defense works and artillery concealed within haystacks. General Uborevich, who is commanding the maneuvers, stated, "Any enemy who dares to attack our motherland will be destroyed by us." (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Minsk: The Soviet Russian army began its annual exercises today. People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov delivered a speech, warning enemies of Soviet Russia at home and abroad that the Stalin government is prepared for war to maintain the safety of the government. At the same time, Voroshilov announced that Soviet Russia has constructed underground artillery fortifications along the western border, similar to the French Maginot Line, "prepared for long-term resistance." Voroshilov was likely referring to Italy and Germany as the countries attacking Soviet Russia. The military exercises began at eight o'clock this morning. In the forests surrounding Minsk, a light rain fell. The long-renowned Cossack troops also participated in the exercises. This is a first since the Russian Revolution because the government is deeply convinced that the Cossack troops can now be loyal, and they have been allowed to re-establish their cavalry units. These exercises are further shrouded in mystery due to the hidden defensive equipment. Both the Red and Blue armies are deeply hidden underground, and their location is unknown. To date, there has been no contact. Even the tank units and artillery units are completely concealed. The commanding officers maintain contact with their troops entirely through secret telegraph lines. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian army will conduct its annual large-scale maneuvers in the Minsk area, between Moscow and Berlin. Four or five generals have already gathered there. However, the whereabouts of General Vasily Blyukher, commander of the Siberian Red Army, are currently unknown. The British, French, and Czech governments have all sent commissioners to observe. These decisive maneuvers will showcase the mechanization of the Russian army and the progress of the Soviet Russian air force this year. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov, along with Generals Tukhachevsky, Egorov, Budyonny, and the chairman of the Belorussian People's Committee, Goloded, have arrived at the maneuver site. Voroshilov listened to the report of Belorussian Military District Commander Uborevich and reviewed the various units, observing the exercises of the "Red" and "Blue" cavalry, motorized, and mechanized units, tanks, and air force. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>Minsk: The commander of the Belorussian Military District of the Soviet Union reported that the Belorussian Military District troops began large-scale strategic exercises on September 8th. Uborevich stated, "We possess first-class military technology. We can crush any enemy, regardless of their numbers or strength, if they dare to attack our motherland. We can conduct the most complex exercises." (TASS, 8th) Can Accommodate 170,000 People in the Kowloon Mountains</p>

<h3 id="e54">German Nazi Party Congress Opens: Hitler Announces Four-Year Plan for Economic Self-Sufficiency; Continues Rearmament and Anti-Communist Struggle; No Concessions on Colonial Demands <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Eighth Nazi Party Congress opened today in Nuremberg. District Leader Wagner read Head of State Hitler's guest speech, which contained a four-year plan. After this, all raw materials needed by Germany will be supplied by German chemists and expanded factories, and will not rely on assistance from other countries at all. The declaration stated that we are not afraid of Bolshevik invasion, because we have the determination to make Germany's military power sufficient to repel any foreign attacks, no matter how fierce and barbaric.</p>
<p>The congress opened this morning in the Luitpold Hall amidst cheers from 30,000 people. Hitler himself performed the opening ceremony. Prominent French figures were invited to attend the ceremony, including former Prime Minister Laval. It is believed that this is a symbol of determination to make Hitler's rule more highly regarded by Britain and France.</p>
<p>After Hitler announced the opening of the congress, his aide Hess stood up to speak, focusing on the events in Spain, saying that Bolshevism is now nakedly exposed in Spain in a barbaric state. After Hess's speech, Wagner promoted Hitler's declaration, which briefly described the achievements of the past four years, with many boastful words, saying that Germany's seaports are no longer as silent as a cemetery, the workers in Germany's factories are four times as many as before, the Krupp factories have resumed their former activities, and the entire nation is now managing common welfare and no longer pursuing private interests. All of these things have been achieved without a single Jew guiding the country's culture (the crowd cheered for a moment at this point). He continued, saying that the world is now in disorder, and except for one great power, all countries are filled with the yeast of Bolshevism. It is easier for other governments to solve economic problems because they have the necessary raw materials produced by their colonies at their disposal. As a British politician said that Germany does not need colonies and can purchase raw materials abroad, his intelligence is just like the Duke of Bourbon saying to his people who asked for bread, "Why don't you eat cake?" If Germany had not lost its colonies before, this would not be enough to support us. Germany in today's situation can never increase wages, because the implementation of this measure will lead to the depreciation of the currency. Creating new industries to supply Germany with the various raw materials it needs is enough to absorb the unemployed labor in the country. When the rearmament program is completed, the unemployed will be free. However, Germany cannot give up on resolving its colonial problems (the crowd cheered). We will report to the people on the various circumstances of protecting Germany's food supply within four years. Germany's independence is now in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>After the declaration stated that Germany is not afraid of Bolshevik invasion, it also said, "Germany's only wish is to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with those in the world who do not invade us and hope for peace." It is reported that Hitler arrived here from Berchtesgaden yesterday afternoon. When he appeared on the platform of the hotel, the people cheered and paid their respects to him. The streets of Nuremberg were filled with Black Guard posts to guard the official representatives who came to the meeting yesterday. At the same time, the exhibition arranged by the Anti-Communist Alliance opened yesterday. It is heard that the purpose of this meeting is to give the people from various countries who came to the meeting a deep impression of the brutality of Soviet Russia. During the congress, the key point of everyone's speech will be the slogan "Bolshevism is the number one enemy of the world." The German Head of State has invited far more British dignitaries than in previous years, and more than 1,200 invitations have been sent out. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Lisbon: Yesterday, a portion of the sailors on the Portuguese small gunboat "Afonso de Albuquerque" and the destroyer "Dão" rebelled, firing upon the Lisbon fort. Fortunately, the fort returned fire, damaging the two ships, and the rebel soldiers surrendered. Lisbon is now as quiet as ever, but the authorities have declared a state of emergency, restricting the movement of troops in Lisbon, and troops have been stationed at all strategic locations. It is reported that six people were killed and nine injured in the incident. According to a statement issued by the Lisbon authorities, the rebellion has been suppressed, all rebel soldiers have been imprisoned, and it is stated that the people and navy of the entire country condemn the rebels' violence. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: After the naval defense ship "Afonso de Albuquerque" and the destroyer "Dão" suddenly rebelled yesterday morning, they were subdued by government forces. The details are as follows: First, the two ships were anchored in the Tagus River. After the rebellion broke out, they weighed anchor and headed for the mouth of the river. Upon hearing the news, the government forces opened fire from the Doutoride Fort on the north bank and the Almada Fort on the south bank, bombarding them. At that time, the "Afonso de Albuquerque" sailed at full speed, hoping to escape, but the shells rained down, and the bow of the ship was damaged, and it eventually ran aground on the right bank. As for the "Dão", after being hit by a shell, it raised a white flag to indicate its surrender. At that time, people on both sides of the river witnessed the bombardment. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: It was learned today that the Almada Fort bombarded the rebel ships, killing five people and injuring eight. All officers and soldiers on the two ships have now been arrested. The Almada Fort apparently knew about the rebellion of the two ships in advance, so it fired upon confirmation. The nearby warships and three submarines did not participate in the operation. The British ship "St. Strathmore" was also nearby and hurriedly sailed out to sea to avoid the bombardment. The "Afonso de Albuquerque" battleship is in danger of sinking today, and a barge has been used to tow it to the shore. The "Dão" has floated again and is being towed to the naval dock for repairs. (National, 8th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: Regarding the gunboat rebellion case, the Council of State held a meeting late last night to discuss follow-up measures. Prime Minister Salazar issued a statement afterwards stating that all officers and sailors of the ships will be stripped of their positions and sent to prison for judicial trial on a regular basis. The officers and junior officers who can prove that they did try to suppress the rebellion will be reinstated, but the captains of the ships will not be forgiven under any circumstances. Military and political figures have declared that this incident was accidental and did not involve other ships. When the forts on both sides of the Tagus River bombarded the rebel ships yesterday, they fired a total of twenty-four shells, eighteen of which hit. (Havas, 9th)</p>

After the governments of various countries responded separately, Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya sent a letter to the League of Nations Secretariat today, stating Hungary's opinions on revising the League of Nations Covenant, stating that Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that economic and military sanctions may be imposed on countries that violate the Covenant and engage in war, but other articles stipulate that disputes that may arise between member states should be resolved by peaceful means and preventive methods, and that all possible efforts should be made to save the situation that may endanger world peace. These two provisions contradict each other in principle and there is an absolute necessity to adjust them. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Hendaye: The conference between representatives of the government and rebel forces to discuss the peaceful surrender of San Sebastián to the rebel forces has collapsed. Therefore, the hope of preserving the city from the ravages of artillery fire has completely vanished. It is heard that the rebel forces have rejected the conditions put forward by Walter, the son of the Governor of San Sebastián, the chief representative of the government, because the conditions stipulated that the government army would not harm the lives of 625 hostages in the city, and would avoid acts of arson, in exchange for the rebel forces to pardon the government garrison. If it is withdrawn before, it will suffer great damage. At the same time, there are more than 8,000 government troops in San Sebastián, most of whom are Basque Nationalists, who are prepared for a last stand. At present, the rebel forces are advancing towards Bazachis, four miles east of San Sebastián. The government forces stationed there have withdrawn and have deployed new positions around San Sebastián. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Burgos: This newspaper's correspondent's special dispatch, the city of Oviedo in the northeast has been surrounded by government forces for the past few days. It is now known that as a result of the National Army's resistance, the government forces in the southwest have retreated slightly, and the Barmadona mountain pass in the southeast has also been occupied by the National Army. Several columns of the National Army are heading towards the city from various directions to rescue the garrison in the city. According to a broadcast message issued by General Delia, commander of the Andalusian Division of the National Army in Seville, the fighting in Talavanera in the province of Toledo is not as fierce as it was in the past few days. It is expected that the north and south armies of the National Army will be able to gain a foothold north of the city in the shortest possible time. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Andaya Yiyu, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, having previously visited the Spanish city of Irún to inspect the scars of the civil war, recently returned to the city for a second time. Although the Nationalist authorities made it difficult for travelers to enter and leave, they were unable to prevent him. According to reports, Irún is now filled with ruins and collapsed walls, with only isolated residential areas unaffected. The city is currently garrisoned by approximately one thousand Carlist troops of the Requetés, who wear red berets and are surrounded by the ruins. The foreign troops have now all been moved to the high ground in front of Rentería, from which they are attacking San Sebastián. These troops are no longer visible in Irún, and many have also left. Government aircraft are still flying over the city from time to time, dropping bombs, but because they dare not fly low, they rarely hit their targets. When the Carlist troops in the city hear the sound of the aircraft, they fire machine guns into the air, but to no effect. The artillery fire from both sides is largely a waste of ammunition. According to what the special correspondent of this newspaper saw, only one shell fired by the cruiser "Cervera" hit a 155mm cannon in the city, blowing it to smithereens. However, most of the houses in the city have been destroyed by explosives, and it is feared that it will take several years to restore the city to its former glory. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Before the fall of Irún, the government troops executed members of the Nationalist side who had been detained as hostages. Among those killed were Mados, a former cabinet member during the dictatorship of General Rivera, and Antonia Mora, niece of former Prime Minister Mora. After these people were killed, their bodies were not formally prepared for burial. Other prisoners were hastily buried in large pits. Now that the Nationalist troops have entered the city, they have reburied their fallen comrades. The special correspondent of this newspaper, who was inspecting the area at the time, personally witnessed two Carlist members of the Requetés excavating the mass graves. When they saw the bodies, they pulled them out. The bodies were pale and their eyes were filled with dirt. Relatives identified the bodies, and an officer inquired about the appearance of the deceased to confirm their identities. After each body was exhumed, it was placed in a coffin, but the coffins were too small, so the legs of the deceased had to be bent to fit. The former chief of the Irún police was buried in this way. Because of Mados's large physique, he was buried in blankets instead of a coffin. The situation at the front lines is currently calm. A few women can be seen knitting two kilometers from the front lines. Many of the bridges along the road have been destroyed. When the correspondent of this newspaper traveled to the city by car, he had to drive five kilometers on the railway tracks to enter the city. The homes of the citizens are now full of crucifixes and portraits of the Carlist pretender. This is very different from the situation when the government troops were defending the city.

<h3 id="e70">Sunlight Engine: A Great Invention of Modern Times; Publicly Tested at the World Power Conference <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Third World Power Conference today tested the sunlight engine, which may be considered a great invention of modern times. The inventor is the famous scientist Dr. Abbot, whose lifetime of research has resulted in the invention. It is claimed that the engine can be used commercially, and that it can be used to generate power in place of coal or oil when these resources become scarce. At the conference, Abbot used sunlight as fuel to power a half-horsepower engine, which is a historic first. He had previously tested a type of sunlight engine many times with excellent results. This is the first time that sunlight has been used to power an engine. The principle is that sunlight from the sky on a clear day strikes the horizontal plane at a right angle. If this sunlight can be fully converted into mechanical work, its power is approximately equal to one horsepower. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Palestine Full of Terror; British Troops Reinforce to Quell Unrest; Large-Scale Suppression Inevitable <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government recently appointed Lieutenant General Dill as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Palestine and has dispatched a large number of troops to garrison the area. This shows the British government's determination to quell the unrest in Palestine. According to military sources here, the British authorities in Palestine will likely adopt the methods used by the British to suppress the Irish rebellion after the Great War, carrying out a "clearance of the countryside" in Palestine and surrounding Arab terrorist groups in order to eliminate the source of the unrest. Once the first division of British reinforcements arrives in Palestine, the British army will take decisive action. At present, the British army is only able to protect the safety of residents, especially Jewish residents, due to its limited strength. However, after the arrival of a large number of reinforcements, they will begin to attack the terrorist groups. Therefore, the conflict between the Arabs and the British army may enter a new phase.</p>
<p>It is reported that the British troops being sent to Palestine are being dispatched in several batches: (1) The "Dorsetshire" is scheduled to set sail from Southampton on September 12 for Palestine, carrying the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Engineers; (2) The "Laurentic" is scheduled to set sail on September 14, carrying headquarters personnel; (3) The "Narkunda" is scheduled to set sail on the same day, carrying soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the North Staffordshire Regiment; (4) The "Dilwara" is scheduled to set sail on September 17, carrying officers from the 1st Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Leicestershire Regiment, and Royal Army Ordnance Corps personnel; (5) The "Neuralia" is scheduled to set sail on September 18, carrying soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards and the 2nd Battalion of the Welch Regiment; (6) The "Windsor Castle" is scheduled to set sail on September 30, carrying the 2nd Battalion of the Scots Guards and Royal Army Pay Corps personnel; (7) The "California" is scheduled to set sail on September 22, carrying soldiers from the 2nd Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment and the 2nd Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment.

<p>(Paris) The wave of strikes in France seems to be erupting again. In the famous Michelin rubber factory in Clermont-Ferrand, a worker was recently fired by the factory. The workers at the factory, who belong to the socialist Confédération Générale du Travail unitaire, believe that the reason for the dismissal is insufficient and immediately went on strike to protest. This happened yesterday afternoon. This morning, 2,000 workers at the factory who belong to the Catholic labor association, the Confédération Française des Travailleurs Chrétiens, believing that there was no sufficient reason for the strike, marched to the prefect's office at 9:00 AM and occupied it. However, the office continued to operate as usual. The Minister of the Interior, Salengro, immediately went to the area to consult with representatives of both labor and management to find a solution. At 6:00 PM, the strikers belonging to the Confédération Générale du Travail unitaire marched to the prefect's office, attempting to break into the office and drive out the Catholic workers. A conflict broke out with the police surrounding the office, resulting in several injuries. Fortunately, the conflict was not serious. The Catholic workers finally left the office at 9:00 PM. In Marseille, labor and management in the metallurgical industry have not yet signed a work contract. The labor side proposed holding a joint meeting to resolve the differences between the two sides, but this was rejected by management. Therefore, the workers in the industry began a strike today. They claim that the metallurgical workers in Paris went on strike for one hour yesterday to protest the "blockade of the Spanish Republic" by various countries (referring to the ban on arms shipments to Spain). The metallurgical workers in Marseille are now standing on the same front as their colleagues in Paris. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Lille, Northern France: More than 30,000 textile workers in the north of France announced a strike at 11:30 this morning, occupying the factories and demanding wage increases and allowing union representatives to negotiate work contracts with management, in accordance with the mediation measures previously formulated by Labor Minister Lebas. The factory owners believe that the time is not yet ripe for this. There has been no action in the main textile centers, such as Roubaix, Tourcoing, and Armentières. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Marseille: 10,000 unnamed metallurgical workers in this port city have announced a strike and are occupying the factories, refusing to leave. The metallurgical employers' association immediately notified the workers that if they did not leave the factories, they would not be allowed to begin negotiations. The authorities in this port city and the Rhône department have summoned representatives of the striking workers to listen to their opinions and try to find a solution. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Fears that Franco's position is increasingly precarious have caused the selling pressure on the franc that began on Monday to resume today, driving the price down to 76.65. The British Equalization Fund intervened and made strenuous efforts to maintain the price to prevent it from falling further. The French Popular Front is increasingly resentful of the ban on arms shipments to Spain, so the Blum government may be replaced by a government with a nationwide consensus. London now believes that if this happens, the fate of the franc will be decided. Regardless of political changes, the continued increase in the cost of living, such as bread, will reduce the excessive value of the franc. The price of bread in France is already two or three times higher than the world average, and there are now signs that workers will continue to demand wage increases. The recent increase in military spending has made the budget deficit even more severe, which can only be made up by the Banque de France. The failure of the "baby bond" experiment has further proven that the French public is unwilling to buy government bonds. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>(Changchun) In order to select fertile land to supply the colonization needs of the large-scale Japanese immigration project planned for the next twenty years, the puppet Manchukuo authorities organized an investigation team to go to various parts of Northern Manchuria to investigate the land situation in preparation for offering it to Japan.

<h3 id="e81">Hunan Province's Finances are Difficult; Another Loan of 1.4 Million Taken from Three Banks <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Communication: He Haoruo, the director of the Finance Department of Hunan Province, has been in office for exactly one year since taking over last year. When he took over, although He had a firm determination to reorganize the finances, Zhang Kailian had left behind debts of more than 3.9 million yuan to various banks and money houses. The monthly interest rate was an average of about 1.3 percent, and even if the principal was not repaid, interest of more than 20,000 yuan had to be paid each month. In addition, the administrative expenses of Hunan Province had accumulated too much over the years. He's debts were increasing and he wanted to force a reorganization, but he was in even more difficult straits. Therefore, in November of last year, he borrowed 1 million yuan from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to repay old debts. This new debt of 1 million yuan had to be repaid at 100,000 yuan per month starting in December of last year, and would be paid off by September of this year. During He's tenure, in addition to repaying the new debt each month, he also repaid a small amount of the old debt. In total, 1.86 million yuan of old debt has been repaid in the past year. Currently, the old debt is only about 2 million yuan. This summer, the provincial government decided to combine offices in order to plan the sale of government property to build a public office building. It is planned to sell four items: the provincial government property in the provincial capital, the lakeside farmland, the wasteland in various counties, and the Hankou property (formerly owned by the Hunan Bank). If all of these properties could be sold, more than 2 million yuan could be obtained, which could be used to build the provincial government building and repay some of the old debt. However, no one has purchased the lakeside farmland, the wasteland in various counties is still under investigation, and the Hankou property also needs to be cleared up. Currently, only the provincial government property in the provincial capital can be sold immediately. This government property includes the provincial granary and the old military governor's office, which could fetch a price of 60,000 or 70,000 yuan, which could be used to build the provincial government building. However, more than 200,000 yuan from the sale of the provincial granary was used by the Civil Affairs Department to build a general hall in Yisuhe and Yiyang for the sake of implementing warehousing, and only a part of the military governor's office was sold due to the high land price, fetching a price of more than 20,000 yuan. In addition, more than 50,000 yuan was taken away by the National Martial Arts Club. The Finance Department's plan to sell government property to repay old debts has become a pie in the sky, so it has no choice but to borrow new debts, extend the loan period, and reduce the interest rate. A month ago, He went to Shanghai and met with the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The three banks had previously made a million-dollar loan and had a good credit rating. As a result of the negotiations, a new loan of 1.4 million yuan was agreed upon with the three banks. All the contract signing procedures have been submitted to the provincial government for filing yesterday. The Central Bank of China provided 560,000 yuan, the Bank of China provided 560,000 yuan, and the Bank of Communications provided 280,000 yuan, for a total of 1.4 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Wu Dingchang Inspects Cooperative Enterprises in Anhui Province; Plans to Establish Vegetable Oil Branch Factory in Anhui <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Promoting cooperative enterprises is now considered a crucial strategy for rural relief. In the past, Anhui Province had two main cooperative organizations: one was the Rural Cooperative Committee, established according to the directives of the Military Council; the other was the Anhui Rural Cooperative Office, set up by the China International Famine Relief Commission using funds allocated for agricultural relief after the 1931 floods. Currently, the total number of cooperative societies has reached around 3,000, covering over 60 counties across Anhui, with operating funds of about 1.5 to 1.6 million, greatly benefiting the rural areas. Consequently, farmers' confidence in them has deepened. Recently, Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang, recognizing that the China International Famine Relief Commission's Anhui Rural Cooperative Office had been placed under the administration of the Ministry of Industry, and that the Rural Cooperative Committee was already under the Ministry's jurisdiction, sought to consolidate authority and facilitate implementation. He traveled to Anhui for inspection, accompanied by Zhang Yuanshan, Director of the Cooperative Affairs Department, and Zheng Dasheng, Section Chief, aiming to provide guidance and maximize development. Upon arriving in Anqing, they first listened to reports from Wu Jingji, Chief Inspector of the Rural Cooperative Committee, and Yang Xingcun, Director of the Office. Accompanied by Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, they inspected cooperative societies in the suburbs of Anqing, including Gao Hebu and Huang Gu Zui. Subsequently, accompanied by Director Liu and others, they departed along the Nanjing-Hefei Road, conducting detailed inspections in Shucheng, Tongcheng, and Hefei counties and towns in central Anhui. From Hefei, they traveled via the Huainan Railway, passing through Chaoxian and Hanshan, arriving in Wuhu yesterday. Yang Mianzhong, Director of the Anhui Finance Department, also awaited them in Wuhu. Directors Liu and Yang, along with local leaders, held a welcoming banquet at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on Zheshan Mountain. During the banquet, Minister Wu highly praised the effective cooperative enterprises in Anhui Province and expressed satisfaction with the economic construction. He pledged to provide substantial assistance to complete all plans for economic construction and rural cooperation throughout Anhui. Wu departed by car for Nanjing that evening, while Director Liu of the Construction Department boarded a river steamer that afternoon to return directly to Anqing. Before leaving, he told reporters that the vegetable oil factory established by the Ministry of Industry would initially focus on refining tung oil to develop foreign trade. However, Anhui Province's tung oil production is only 30,000 to 50,000 dan per year, which is quite limited. The local need is for refining rapeseed oil, with recent annual exports exceeding 300,000 dan, sold primarily to Japan. Therefore, a positive study on refining rapeseed oil is necessary. Experts are currently inspecting Anhui, and a decision on whether to establish a vegetable oil branch factory in Anhui will be made in the very near future. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Amidst Agricultural Bumper Harvests, Hubei Province Treasury Revenue Gradually Increases; Total Tax Revenue for the First Half of the Year Reaches 3.2 Million Yuan; Land Deeds Increase, Business and Brokerage Taxes Decrease <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: With bumper harvests in Hubei Province this year, rural finance is showing some activity, and there is hope for a gradual increase in provincial treasury revenue. According to a recent survey of various tax revenues for the past six months: (1) Actual land tax revenue was over 1,050,000 yuan; (2) Actual deed tax revenue was over 458,000 yuan; (3) Actual business tax revenue was over 1,179,000 yuan; (4) Actual brokerage tax revenue was over 47,000 yuan; (5) Actual slaughter tax revenue was over 168,000 yuan; (6) Actual tobacco and alcohol license tax revenue was over 51,000 yuan; (7) Actual public property revenue was over 237,000 yuan. The total revenue was 3.2 million yuan. The land tax revenue increased by over 100,000 yuan compared to the amount collected last year. This is despite the fact that many counties requested exemptions due to floods and droughts last year, and many county governments did not report the allocation of collection fees to the treasury for accounting. Otherwise, the increase would have been even greater. The provincial government is now exerting its full effort to rectify the situation, and future revenue should improve further. Deed tax revenue increased by over 76,000 yuan compared to the second half of last year because the government showed consideration for disaster victims and waived penalties for late tax payments on unregistered deeds, encouraging many people to register. However, business tax, brokerage tax, slaughter tax, tobacco and alcohol license tax, and public property revenue all fell short of expectations due to consecutive years of disasters, rural bankruptcy, weak consumption, and commercial decline. Business tax was short by over 105,000 yuan, brokerage tax was short by over 26,000 yuan, slaughter tax was short by over 90,000 yuan, tobacco and alcohol license tax was short by over 12,000 yuan, and public property revenue was short by over 13,000 yuan. While this is unavoidable during the rectification process, the main reason remains the disasters. Therefore, the government still relies on central subsidies to cover expenses. Fortunately, this year is a bountiful year, and future tax revenues will definitely increase daily. (September 7th)</p>

However, the deceased had a foster son, Jin Yusheng, who was known to associate with undesirable individuals and was considered a prime suspect. He has been arrested and taken to the bureau. At the same time, a habitual thief, Lu Ashui, was also arrested on suspicion. Both were sent to the District Court for interrogation on the 9th.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Jiangsu Province collecting a housing levy from residents, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce has previously telegraphed the Provincial Government and Ministry of Finance, urging a swift halt based on the "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Housing Levies in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province."

They also sent telegrams to the Ministry and Province based on the law, striving to achieve the goal of abolishment. Furthermore, the Gaoyou Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating that the Provincial Government had been consulted to handle the matter in accordance with Article 10 of the approved measures. Therefore, although the county had issued new regulations for the housing levy, the housing levy had not been implemented. They have now sent a letter to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce to inform them of this.</p>

<p>Since construction of the Lianyungang Longhai Electric Plant began last year, the building was completed by April this year. However, the installation of internal machinery was not immediately completed, so they rushed to install it overnight. By the end of August, the installation was finally complete. The plant manager telegraphed several British engineers from the Shanghai Electric Plant to come to the port to inspect the machinery and supervise the trial run. It is said that the machine is the latest invention of British electric machinery, worth over 200,000 yuan. The trial run was conducted on the evening of the 4th, and there were no problems. The magnitude of its horsepower and the brightness of its light need not be elaborated. However, because the Huangwo Dam has not been completed, the water supply, although stored, is still inconvenient. It is truly a fly in the ointment. It is now scheduled to begin sending electricity at the end of September, when the poles along all roads are fully installed.</p>

<p>Recently, the weather in Lianyungang has been intermittently cloudy and sunny, with frequent hurricanes. Today (the 5th), the sea also experienced high tide. For a time, strong winds and huge waves crashed directly against the coast, splashing waves tens of feet high, sounding like thousands of horses galloping. In an instant, the wave-blocking wall of Pier No. 1 collapsed completely, stretching over twenty zhang. Seawater rushed to the warehouses on the pier. The coastal walls east of the pier also collapsed in many places. The loss to the project is quite substantial.</p>

While passing the Jinqiao area of Wangjiangjing Tang, they were suddenly met by two small boats. There were five people in the boats, who blocked their way, ordered them to stop, and beat Mo Baochen with oars. As a result, they robbed all one dan of rice and 93.7 yuan of cash they carried. They immediately went to the Beiping Township Office and the Tangwan Street Police Station to report the case for investigation.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency reports: Yesterday (the 9th) was the 42nd anniversary of Premier Sun's first uprising in Guangzhou. The city party headquarters specially convened a grand meeting in its auditorium, attended by over 200 people, including representatives from all district party headquarters, district sub-branches, and all staff members of the headquarters. Committee member Huang Zaoxiong chaired the meeting, Zhang Hanyun served as master of ceremonies, and Du Mengsen recorded the proceedings. After performing the rituals, Chairman Huang Zaoxiong delivered a report, stating in essence that today is the 41st anniversary of the Premier's first uprising. Recalling this day 41 years ago, the Premier's emotions were undoubtedly tense, and the sacrifices of the martyrs, who bravely marched forward and disregarded their own safety, were incredibly tragic and passionate. Therefore, we should especially commemorate this anniversary, which marks the beginning of overthrowing the Manchu Qing government and establishing the Republic of China. However, can the revolution of these past 41 years be considered a success? Should our comrades still strive for further progress? In my opinion, the revolution cannot yet be considered a success, and comrades must continue to work hard. Internally, we must eliminate the Communist Party and strive for construction; externally, we must abolish unequal treaties to complete the Premier's unfinished revolutionary work. The only somewhat comforting aspect is that the Guangxi issue has been resolved peacefully. The forces of local separatism that have existed for over 20 years can be destroyed, and the hope of unifying China and presenting a united front to the outside world is not difficult to achieve. Soon, the National Assembly will be convened, the Constitution will be promulgated, and constitutional governance will begin, marking the successful conclusion of the Premier's revolutionary cause. Today, we commemorate the Premier's first uprising; in the future, we will celebrate the success of the revolution. With this, we wish the Republic of China long life. All agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters at all levels throughout the city uniformly displayed flags yesterday to celebrate.</p>

<h3 id="e99">China General Chamber of Industry Federation Sends Telegram to the Executive Yuan and Ministry, Requesting the Abolition of the Ji-Cha Inspection Office and the Severe Punishment of Those Who Proposed or Promoted Its Implementation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The China General Chamber of Industry Federation in this city, due to the Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee levying new taxes on smuggled goods and having formally established an inspection office, telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry again yesterday, requesting strict sanctions and ordering its abolition. The original text reads: "Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, your esteemed consideration: The Ji-Cha authorities initially denied the establishment of an inspection office, or claimed that, although there was such a proposal, it had actually been abandoned. Now, the inspection office has actually been found to be located at No. 8 Xujia Building, Hua'an Street, Special District 2, Tianjin, and is preparing for its establishment, starting on September 1st. The director and deputy director are Wang Hongen and Yuan Chonghuan, respectively, and they have openly and formally hosted the Tianjin press. This is a fact and cannot be concealed. According to the written statement issued by the inspection office (Shen Bao, September 7th, special dispatch), it is planned to investigate smuggled goods that have been smuggled into the mainland without paying customs duties, and to collect inspection fees to regulate market prices and maintain legitimate merchants. This is only a temporary expedient. Once the government has a solution, it will be stopped, and so on. This is a reversal of right and wrong, confusing black and white, and is extremely absurd. Investigating tax-evading smuggled goods is a violation of national laws and should be strictly investigated and dealt with. The National Government has already promulgated anti-smuggling regulations, and penalties should be imposed accordingly. All smuggled goods found should be confiscated and fines imposed and punished. How can they be investigated and then released after collecting inspection fees? It is inappropriate to release them, and even if the inspection fees are 'discretionary,' the amount collected must be very small. Smugglers have already violated the law, and those who find smuggled goods but do not handle them in accordance with national laws and arbitrarily collect handling fees and release them are also violating the law. Strictly speaking, it is like collusion and should be jointly punished. Moreover, smugglers are like thieves. How can there be a reason to call thieves legitimate merchants? Thieves are arrested and brought to justice, and they deserve what they get. Now, there are those who pity the thieves who have nowhere to place their stolen goods and actually find ways to clear them out and collect inspection fees, allowing them to sell the goods. Then, what is the difference between those who collect fees and those who sit on the ground and share the loot? If they reward the style of thieves and regard tax evasion as a legitimate business, then those who abide by the law and pay taxes will be worse than thieves. How can there be such a reason in the world? The anti-smuggling regulations promulgated by the National Government are the government's solution to tax evasion. How can other solutions be proposed? This is clearly a misrepresentation. The major cause of the decline in market prices is the proliferation of tax-evading goods. Legitimate merchants suffer losses and cannot maintain their business. The entry of tax-evading goods into the mainland comes from North China. North China cannot stop smuggling and strictly reject smuggled goods. Instead, it helps its fierce flames. They still say, 'To regulate market prices and maintain legitimate merchants.' There is no doubt that this is a reversal of black and white. The Chinese-owned yarn factories in Tianjin have been sold to Japanese merchants due to the dumping of tax-evading cotton yarn, resulting in losses and closures. It has not been heard that the North China authorities have sympathized with their plight and come forward to maintain and rescue them to prevent production from falling into the hands of foreigners. Now, they pay special attention to tax-evading smuggled goods and ease their sales channels. What could be more absurd than this? In their written statement, there are also words such as 'If there are more smuggled goods coming in, the responsibility depends on how the customs fights smuggling.' There is no intention to cooperate in fighting smuggling. Customs in North China is very strict in fighting tax evasion, but it has not been heard that the North China authorities have assisted customs in fighting smuggling. Show this to the whole country. Now, they are setting up this inspection office, which destroys the complete system of national tariffs. What else can be said about their madness? We know that the special environment in North China is extremely difficult, but this concerns the sovereignty of the entire China. How can we forget the national and national concepts and blindly follow others and engage in it? If it is taken by foreign forces, we should resist to the death and call out to redress grievances. Now, they do not hesitate to damage their reputation, do not hear rumors, do not ask right or wrong, and do it calmly, and issue such absurd remarks, no less than showing to China and foreign countries that China's complete tariff system has been destroyed by North China itself, and smuggling work has also been fundamentally eliminated by North China itself. How can the people of the country tolerate it? We should telegraph to the illegal agencies for emergency sanctions, order the North China Political Affairs Committee to transfer the inspection office and abolish it within a deadline, and severely punish those who propose or implement it, in order to extend national law and sovereignty. China General Federation of Industry Standing Committee members Guo Shun, Cai Shengbai, Wang Qiyu, Hu Xiyuan, Zhu Gengtao, bowed, Jia."</p>

<p>New cotton from various parts of our country has been launched this year. The China Agricultural Banking Group, etc., has allocated huge sums of money to handle cotton marketing loans in various provinces. The Marketing General Office of the Central Cotton Improvement Institute, etc., have agreed on the cotton cooperative of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei and other three provinces in the cotton marketing methods of the year 25 as follows: Article 1, the cotton cooperative marketing 70% payment method for members: When members hand in cotton to the cooperative, the cooperative will pay 70% of the cotton price in advance according to the local market price, and then immediately classify and pack the cotton and transport it to the nearest marketing branch, entrust the agency for sale or sell it by the agency itself, and the risk shall be borne by the members. If there is a surplus at the end of the year, members can get cooperative dividends. Article 2, there are two methods for individual marketing with 100% payment of cotton: (1) If the marketing office handles it for the manufacturer at the cooperative, the profit and loss shall be borne by the client, and the cooperative shall only charge a considerable handling fee and enjoy special tax benefits. (2) If the cooperative purchases it with 100% payment and the member's cotton is transported to the nearest marketing office for sale, the profit and loss shall be borne by the cooperative, the member shall not bear the market price risk, and there shall be no cooperative dividends. Regarding the above-mentioned Article 1 and Article 2 (2), special attention should be paid to reducing risk methods, which are listed as follows: (1) The marketing branch calculates according to local market conditions, formulates product standards, and notifies each agency of the price limit at any time, and each agency's valuation of cotton shall be based on the standard product valuation, and shall not exceed the marketing office's limit. (2) Each agency should accept the guidance of the inspectors sent by the marketing office regarding cotton harvesting and marketing operations. (3) The cotton collected by each agency should be packed into bales as soon as possible and transported to the nearest marketing branch for sale, and must not be transported far or stockpiled to avoid risk. The total amount of cotton stored in the agency and in transit and stored in the warehouse designated by the marketing office that has not been sold shall be limited to an average of 100 dan per agency. (4) Whenever a member returns a loan for production, the agency must attach a notice to the cotton when it arrives at the branch (detailed methods will be formulated separately). After the cotton is sold, the principal and interest of the loan for production shall be deducted by the branch and returned to the banking group. (5) For cotton purchased with 70% or 100% payment, the branch shall still pay the selling price to the cooperative after the sale to facilitate turnover. If the warehouse can provide a 70% pledge for the cotton before it is sold, the money obtained from the pledge shall be handed over to the agency to facilitate turnover. After the cotton is sold, the principal and interest of the pledge shall be deducted and the remaining money shall be returned to the cooperative. After receiving the money, the agency shall distribute the remaining money to the members or include it in its own income according to the regulations of the cooperative. (6) During the business marketing period, each agency shall fill in the daily report and send it to the marketing branch every day to facilitate verification of the quantity and price, and to examine the amount of production loans recovered, so that it can be deducted and returned to the banking group.</p>

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation received a direct instruction from the Ministry of Finance, No. 10667, yesterday: "Reply to the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation's submission on August 14, 25, regarding the earnest request to forward to the Central Government, taking into account the people's sentiments and sympathizing with the lives of lower-level staff, to change the salary income tax to start at 50 yuan or more, in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. The submission is noted. The starting point for the second category of salary and remuneration income is 30 yuan. Considering the ordinary living expenses of people in various parts of our country, and comparing them with the living standards of various countries in the East and West, the standard is still low. Taking 30 yuan as the starting point is not overly strict. Moreover, a tax rate of 5% per 10 yuan is levied on 30 yuan of income. The people will not be burdened by such a slight tax obligation, nor will it affect the livelihoods of individuals or families. The Provisional Regulations on Income Tax and its Implementation Rules have been approved by the Executive Yuan and are scheduled to be implemented from October 1 of this year. The second category of civil servant salary and remuneration income, and the third category of bond deposit interest income will also be levied from October 1, and other items will be levied from January 1, 26. The request to forward the amendments should not be discussed. Please be informed."</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Yangtze River Basin Has a Bumper Harvest; Shipping Suddenly Flourishes, Restoring the Golden Age <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the Yangtze River route, the business of various companies has sharply declined. After the six companies' alliance and public sharing, although the water foot has been raised, there is very little freight. In July of this year, the six companies planned to reduce the number of shifts, average freight, and organize a Yangtze River inspection team to try to reverse the decline. However, due to Nichi Qing's opposition, this matter was not realized. However, because of the bumper harvest along the Yangtze River, the shipping industry suddenly turned around. All the farmland in the provinces of the Yangtze River Basin and the counties around Dongting Lake had a lower water level, and with favorable weather conditions, all crops were harvested at 100%. The early rice transported to Shanghai has arrived like a tide, part of which is transshipped to Shantou and Guangdong, and part of which is stored in Shanghai. In Changsha, new rice is piled up like a mountain, and farmers are eager to sell. Therefore, in the recent weeks, the downstream Yangtze River vessels of the six companies have almost all been loaded with new rice, beans, wheat, etc., and each vessel has been loaded at 100%, and some have even exceeded the load-bearing capacity. For example, the Jianshe steamship ran aground because it was carrying too much cargo. Taking the China Merchants Bureau as an example, the Yangtze River grains piled up in the docks of Jinliyuan Wharf have filled up all the docks. Jiujiang and Wuhu are also shipping new rice to Shanghai from Jiangxi and Anhui, so that the Hakka people in various ports are competing to load agricultural products, which has never been seen before, because if they are one shift behind, the market price will be lower. Unfortunately, the six companies are bound by public constraints and cannot add more vessels. Only Nichi Qing Company has been able to take the opportunity to increase the number of vessels, saying that it will resume the ships that have been suspended, and has been competing to load large quantities of grains from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui to Shanghai. Therefore, among the downstream businesses, Nichi Qing is the best, followed by China Merchants, Jardine, Sanbei, Taikoo, and Ning Shao. The six companies are concerned about the large amount of grain on the Yangtze River this year, and have agreed to increase the downstream freight rate by 10% on top of the original rate, which has already been implemented, so that large river vessels can earn as much as 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per trip, at least doubling the income compared to the same period last year. Therefore, the Yangtze River route has been restored to the golden age. At the same time, the water foot of the Sichuan River has also risen, because the construction of the Sichuan River is in full swing. Places that were previously inconvenient to travel to can now be reached, and the market has improved. In addition, after the crackdown on smuggled goods, the sales of domestic goods have gradually recovered. Due to the congestion last year, the companies agreed to increase the freight rate for goods shipped from Shanghai to Chongqing or from Yichang to Chongqing by 10%. The cotton yarn water foot has also been notified to the family to increase from 16 yuan to 18 yuan per piece. It is still unprecedented for the Sichuan River to increase prices during the flood season. People in the shipping industry say that the water foot for transporting Sichuan goods will increase greatly during the dry season soon.</p>

<p>After the Anhui Provincial Finance and Construction Bureaus signed a contract with the China Agricultural Credit Banking Group for a loan of 1 million yuan for agricultural warehouse storage, the agricultural warehouses in Fengyang and other counties have been completed one after another. Peng Yinxuan, the director of the Anhui Office of the Banking Group (the manager of the Wuhu branch of the Bank of Communications), recently arrived in Shanghai to meet with Zou Bingyou, Li Zhongchu, and Wu Xiaoyuan, the executive directors of the Banking Group, to discuss the storage and loan methods, and the discussions have been completed. He returned to Wuhu by ship the day before yesterday. As for the agricultural storage and loan disbursement in Anhui Province, it will begin to be handled immediately after Peng's arrival in Wuhu. It is also reported that the province's Finance and Construction Bureaus have borrowed 1.4 million yuan from the China Farmers Bank and 2 million yuan from the Bank of China. The Jiaohu branches of the two banks have negotiated and signed contracts nearby. The method is the same as the 1 million yuan borrowed from the Agricultural Credit Banking Group.</p>

At the same time, Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang has also returned to Beijing after completing the inspection. Deputy General Manager Zou Bingwen went to Beijing from Shanghai the night before to visit Minister Wu and meet with General Manager Chen to discuss the preparations for the Agricultural Capital Bureau. It is reported that it has been decided to hold the first board meeting in Beijing before the end of the month to announce its establishment. In addition, Deputy General Manager Qian Xinzhi is unable to go to Beijing due to busy affairs at the four banks.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance that legal tender should be universally valid and not restricted by place names, the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the four central banks yesterday that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank do not have place names printed on them, except for Shanghai and Chongqing, and are universally valid throughout the country. However, banknotes with the place names of Shanghai and Chongqing are also universally valid throughout the country and are not restricted by the place names. Banknotes of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications that are commonly used in the market have place names printed on them, but are not restricted by the place names. However, banknotes issued in "Manchukuo" (i.e., the Three Northeastern Provinces), such as Harbin and Fengtian, are not included. The newly issued banknotes of the China Farmers Bank do not have place names printed on them and are universally valid throughout the country. Banknotes with place names issued in the past are also universally valid throughout the country.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Guangdong Province Illegally Confiscates Power Company: Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs for Correction <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Director of the Guangzhou Headquarters, and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, requesting the correction of Guangdong Province's confiscation of a commercially-run power company in 1932. The original telegram stated: "To Director Chiang of the Guangzhou Headquarters, for transfer to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: On the 8th of this month, we received a joint letter from Liang Guben, Li Jitang, Liang Hongxun, Zhou Xiwen, Liang Yuangong, Pan Zhihang, Ma Bonian, and other shareholders of the Guangzhou Power Company, stating: 'Our company was illegally confiscated by the Guangzhou Municipal Government on July 8, 1932, and our capital and advances exceeding ten million yuan have been lost without any resolution. The patent term has also not expired. The shareholders' meeting unanimously resolved to fight to the death, and domestic and overseas organizations advocating public welfare have also appealed on our behalf. The Central Construction Committee issued a dispatch to the Guangdong Provincial Government in November of the same year, ordering a thorough investigation and to cease the confiscation; however, at that time, the warlords were in power and refused to obey the order, so we had to endure in silence until now. We have found that at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), members proposed protecting private enterprises and prohibiting the confiscation of private power companies, which was passed at the Third General Assembly. This glorious resolution should not be a mere formality. Furthermore, in the past, electric light companies in Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhejiang, and other places were also confiscated by local governments, but Director Chiang ordered their return. This demonstrates the government's determination to maintain private enterprises, which has long been known throughout the world. The case of our company is the same, so how can it be treated differently? Now that Guangdong's administration is unified, all local officials must abide by the central government's clear orders. We have submitted a request for the return of our company based on reason and facts. We are extremely grateful for your association's sympathy and assistance in the past. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, we still request that your association continue to telegraph appeals to the authorities to promptly return our company, so as to maintain the central government's authority and protect the people's property. This will be beneficial to China's industry.' Upon arrival, it was found that this matter was discussed by the association on September 3, 1932. The association sent a detailed telegram to the Ministry of Industry (your ministry), clearly stating the company's illegal confiscation by the Guangzhou Municipal Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government's protection of the confiscation. On September 13 of the same year, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Industry (your ministry) with document number 4997, stating that the Guangdong Provincial Government had been requested to provide a detailed reply for verification and handling. However, this matter was ultimately delayed for four years because it was said that there was no legal or factual basis for the claim. The Ministry of Industry (your ministry) was unable to verify and handle the case, resulting in irreparable losses for the shareholders. Now that Guangdong's political orders are unified and follow the central government's directives, all cases of illegal actions in the past that have not been corrected should be investigated and dealt with one by one, so that businessmen can have hope for revival. We hereby submit this situation to your director (ministry) for review and approval, and humbly request that you order the Guangdong Provincial Government to review the original case of the Ministry of Industry in September 1932 and conduct a re-examination and handling of the commercial stock company that should not have been confiscated, in accordance with the law, so as to demonstrate justice and maintain the rule of law. This would be in the public interest. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Promoting the Notary System: Simplified Procedures <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the National News Agency in this city on the 9th, the current notary system requires that if a notary public officer does not know the applicant, the applicant must present a certificate from the district chief, chamber of commerce, or police chief of the jurisdiction, or have two witnesses known to the officer to prove their identity. This is clearly stipulated in Article 17, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Rules for Notarization. However, in practice, it takes time and is inconvenient for applicants to directly request certificates from the aforementioned authorities. It is also not easy to find two witnesses known to the officer to prove their identity. Therefore, the promotion of the notary system has many obstacles. Recently, the Minhou District Court submitted a request to the ministry to have the court send a letter to the district chief, chamber of commerce, or police chief to verify that the applicant is indeed the person in question, and the reply letter would be regarded as a certificate; or to have the court send two staff members to investigate and report that the person is indeed the person in question, which would also be regarded as having the effect of a certificate, so as to avoid inconvenience to the applicant and ensure the smooth implementation of the notary system. The Judicial Yuan believes that the proposed method is feasible and has already instructed all courts handling notarization to be informed accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Four Grain Industry Associations Host Public Banquet for Director Pan Yesterday: Guests and Host Exchange Speeches <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The four trade associations of the bean and rice industry, miscellaneous grain industry, rice shop industry, and rice milling industry in this city held a public banquet at the Cui Xi Tang of the Yu Garden in the French Concession last night for Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. More than 50 executive and supervisory committee members from the four associations attended. The banquet started at 7:00 PM. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, first delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a speech by Lu Wenfu, Standing Committee Member of the Rice Shop Industry Association, who briefly stated that Director Pan was the first Director of the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce in this city, and then became the Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, serving the local area and achieving many accomplishments that cannot be fully described. He was fair and impartial in mediating labor disputes, enabling coordination between labor and management. He was deeply grateful for his detailed guidance to the grain industry, such as regulating grain, stabilizing rice prices, handling price-controlled rice sales, benefiting the common people, designing and building warehouses, preparing for famine and storing grain, and planning to unify the new system of measuring instruments. With the leadership of such a capable official, the industry could be stable. He expressed his joy at Director Pan's return to the Bureau of Social Affairs and offered a toast to show his respect. Pan Gongzhan then stood up to express his gratitude and said that grain is related to the people's food. In years of famine and reduced harvests, farmers are certainly in distress, but in years of good harvests, prices are low, which is also harmful to farmers. He hoped that the leaders of the grain industry would pay close attention to this. The banquet ended happily at 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Sanbei Company's river steamer Fuhua, ordered to proceed to Taipingxi to rescue the Fuyang vessel, arrived at Wanxian at 5:30 PM on the 7th of this month. As usual, it dropped anchor, but because the river water had receded greatly and the sand at the bottom of the river was very thick, it could not move forward. It then began to move backward, but unexpectedly, the right engine propeller became entangled with the anchor chain of the Yunchang vessel. Both ships were affected. The Yunchang vessel, fearing an accident, quickly released its anchor. The Fuhua was then safe, but the Yunchang's anchor chain was entangled in the Fuhua's propeller, and the Fuhua was unable to move. It had to remain anchored at Wanxian and hire divers to go into the water to release the entangled anchor chain before it could sail again. Efforts are being made to salvage the anchor dropped by the Yunchang vessel.</p>

<p>According to Da Gong She, the general registration of opium smokers in this city, which began on May 10 of this year, was originally scheduled to end after three months on August 10. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to give opium smokers a final opportunity to register, specially requested the Municipal Government to forward the request to the General Supervisory Department for Opium Prohibition of the Military Affairs Commission for approval to extend the deadline to September 10 (today). During this extended registration period, more than 10,000 opium smokers applied for registration. Together with the opium smokers who registered voluntarily from July 20 to the end of September 1935, and those who registered compulsorily from October 1, 1935 to the end of January 1936, the total number of registered opium smokers is over 40,000.</p>
<p>Closure of Two Offices</p>
<p>The general registration work will end today. All offices, including the office of the Commissioner for Opium Prohibition and Drug Control of the Military Affairs Commission stationed in Shanghai and Jiangsu Province, the Municipal Opium Prohibition Committee, and the Opium Smoker Guidance and Registration Office jointly established by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, are scheduled to close by 4:00 PM today. Ma Liang, Commissioner for Opium Prohibition and Drug Control, has returned to Shanghai from the town and will preside over the closing affairs before going to Beijing to report to the General Supervisory Department of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>Random Household Checks</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering that there must be a large number of opium smokers who are concealing themselves and failing to register, as well as opium criminals who obtain individual opium licenses and privately set up opium dens for others to smoke in, has decided to implement random household checks after the completion of the general registration work in order to thoroughly eliminate the problem. The method of random checks is very strict. If any collusion or perversion of justice is found in any sub-bureau or district under its jurisdiction, the officials and police officers responsible for the district will be severely punished. The Fourth Section of the General Bureau has been supervising the various districts in handling pledge signing and investigation work in recent days, and is being exceptionally conscientious.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Overseas Tea Market Demand Very High: National Tea Export Volume Increases Sharply: Over 3.9 Million Quintals Last Month: British and Russian Firms Compete to Purchase Qi Hong and Other Teas <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>This year, due to strong overseas demand for Chinese new tea, various types of new tea are shipped to Shanghai and sold as soon as they arrive, which is exceptionally smooth. The strength of the market and the prospects for exports are rare in recent years. According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's report, the total export of green tea last month was 3,922,581 quintals. From January to July, the total was 14,593,691 quintals. The detailed analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>British and Russian Search</p>
<p>This year, due to strong overseas demand for various types of new tea, sales are brisk. Among them, Qi Hong is particularly in demand due to its later opening. Foreign firms are especially eager for it. Tunxi, Zhenmei, Pingshui, Huzhou, Gaozhuang, and other green teas are also exporting exceptionally smoothly due to large-scale purchases by American firms. At the same time, Yichang tea is also being sold in large quantities to Britain. In particular, the Qi Fu and Hua Xiang varieties are selling even better due to competition between British and Russian firms. However, sales of Philippine green tea suddenly became sluggish in the last ten days of last month due to the impact of the Moroccan War. In short, since the arrival of new tea this year, the market has been strong and has not weakened, which is a good sign for the transformation of Chinese tea's foreign trade. It is hoped that the tea industry will strive forward and that its future will be bright.</p>
<p>Monthly Statistics</p>
<p>Last month, the export of tea leaves included: Green tea to the United States: 54,992 quintals; black tea: 42,115 quintals; other tea: 772 quintals.

<p>The Sanbei Company's river steamer Fuyang, which was carrying cargo upstream on the 2nd of this month, ran aground 180 miles upstream of Yichang, near Taipingxi. This was seen by a foreign vessel, which reported it to Shanghai. Upon receiving the news, the company immediately telegraphed Ren Ziqing, manager of the Yichang branch, to rush to the rescue. The rumor that the vessel had sunk was a distant rumor. Only one hold at the bottom of the ship was damaged, the drive shaft was damaged, and there was movement in the cabins and rooms. The machinery, engines, rudder blades, and hull of the ship are all in good condition. The company has received a report from Yichang stating that the cargo in each hold has been completely unloaded and can be discussed in Chongqing by Fuhua. The water-damaged cargo will be inspected by the public notary, Mr. White, to handle the water damage procedures. As for the hull, after being supported by wooden piles, the holes have been filled. In addition, as the upper river has receded by eight feet, the vessel has completely escaped danger and is floating on the riverbank (as shown in the picture above). Repairs are currently underway and efforts can be made to tow it back to Shanghai. The speed of the Sanbei Company's rescue of the Fuyang, the quick escape from danger, and the minimal losses have set a new record for river steamers.</p>

<p>However, Due to Absence of Commercial Treaty, Currently Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin She, since the return of the Chinese delegation to Siam, the urgent need to improve Sino-Siamese relations has attracted the attention of the whole country. In order to maintain the inherent economic position of overseas Chinese in Siam, the establishment of a large-scale bank is indeed an urgent matter. Recently, there has been talk that the Bank of China will prepare to establish a branch in Bangkok. The Xin Xin She reporter specially inquired about the truth from the banking community. It is reported that since the return of the political delegation to Siam, it has been generally agreed that cultivating the economic vitality of overseas Chinese and establishing a large-scale bank in Bangkok is an urgent task to rescue the overseas Chinese. There are more than 3 million overseas Chinese in Siam, most of whom are engaged in agriculture and commerce. The economic center of Siam is mostly in the hands of overseas Chinese. In recent years, due to the panic of the world economy and the oppression of various countries, the economic strength has gradually weakened. Although there are Huaqiao Bank and Hua Shang Bank in Siam, they are limited in scale and can hardly serve as the backing for the entire overseas Chinese economy. If it is allowed to develop naturally without self-help, the economy of the overseas Chinese in Siam will eventually be oppressed and collapse. Therefore, the overseas Chinese hope that the country can quickly establish a bank in Siam. However, although the relationship between China and Siam is deep, due to the absence of a commercial treaty, all progress is difficult to begin. Therefore, the most needed thing at present is for the Sino-Siamese commercial treaty to be signed as soon as possible to establish formal diplomatic relations, so that the establishment of a large-scale bank and the relief of overseas Chinese can proceed smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e119">China Alcohol Factory Drops Prices: Machinery Association Requests Curb <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi She, the Machinery Association submitted a report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, stating that the state-run alcohol factory is dropping prices and competing with private alcohol factories. They earnestly request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Industry to first curb the price drop and then convene both parties to limit production and regulate selling prices based on registered production volume in order to provide relief and avoid competing with the people for profit. According to a letter from member Meilong Spice Factory, "Last year, the China Alcohol Factory drastically reduced prices and squeezed out the same industry. The association kindly forwarded the report to the Ministry of Industry, which ordered the China Alcohol Factory to cooperate with the association and other factories in the spirit of mutual assistance. However, because the China Alcohol Factory proposed harsh and controversial conditions, it did not come to fruition. However, the spirit of impartiality in the association's handling of the matter has made our factory extremely grateful. Now, the China Alcohol Factory is determined to destroy the same industry without end. On August 6 of this year, it continued to drop the price from 8 jiao 5 fen per gallon to 7 jiao 6 fen, and there are rumors that the price will continue to drop. As a factory that claims to promote industry, it has always gone against its claims, which is both infuriating and regrettable. Therefore, our factory's board of directors decided to submit a report to the Ministry of Industry again to curb this practice. Your association is the leading organization for national goods and has always had a love for industry. We respectfully send this letter and hope that your association will continue to pursue this matter and urge the Ministry of Industry to deal with this case quickly so that justice can be done and people's livelihoods can be relied upon. This is not only the good fortune of our factory. We have attached a copy of the document submitted to the ministry. We hope that you will review and approve it." Upon investigation, the competition between the China Alcohol Factory and the same industry is fierce, and the price drop is huge. In May of last year, Meilong, Zhonghua, Xiaguang, and other alcohol factories jointly submitted a letter to the association requesting the government's relief. Subsequently, in July of the same year, the Ministry of Industry issued document number 12752, instructing the association to convene China, Meilong, Xiaguang, Zhonghua, and other four alcohol factories for amicable cooperation many times, which lasted for four months, but it was difficult to reach an agreement. On October 23 of the same year, the situation was reported to the Ministry of Industry for the record. At that time, the selling price of alcohol had dropped from 1 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen to 8 jiao 5 fen, causing Xiaguang and Zhonghua alcohol factories to be unable to maintain operations and close down one after another. Currently, only China and Meilong factories remain. The China Alcohol Factory clearly knows that the selling price of foreign alcohol is above 2 yuan. If domestic alcohol is sold for 1 yuan 5 jiao, it is enough to compete with foreign goods. If there is no ambition to merge private alcohol factories, why drop the price to 8 jiao 5 fen, and now even below 8 jiao? Such endless competition goes against the Executive Yuan's intention to protect industry and encourage production. Our association has always aspired to develop national goods. In this time of national crisis, instead of thinking about competing with foreign countries, it is only thinking about competing internally, which is painful and difficult to bear in silence. However, the China Alcohol Factory is a factory jointly operated by the Ministry of Industry. If we do not earnestly request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Industry to first curb the price drop, convene both parties to limit production and regulate selling prices based on registered production volume, and provide relief, others will not be able to lead and comply. In fact, the government has repeatedly stated that it will never compete with the people for profit. Therefore, we specially submit this report, attaching a copy of Meilong Factory's document submitted to the ministry, and earnestly request that the Executive Yuan review and approve it, and order the Ministry of Industry to convene both parties to formulate measures so that it can be brought into order. The country is fortunate, and the industry is fortunate.</p>

<p>The Lido Company on Matte Hirst Road in this city, with its sparse flowers and trees and elegant inner space, has been very popular since the early opening of the swimming pool. This is because all the new buildings in the group are modern and meet the psychology of the general public in modern society, so it has been a success for a while. However, this swimming pool is still an accessory. It is heard that the grand ballroom, which cost nearly 100,000 yuan to build, is magnificent and will soon be completed. The content is grand and magnificent, and it is unparalleled. There is probably no match in the entire Shanghai. The hall is also equipped with air conditioning to control the climate, and the musicians are top-notch. There are more than 100 dancers, who are as beautiful as flowers. The restaurant and garden will also be decorated at the same time. The exquisite Western cuisine and the attentive service of the waiters are especially noteworthy. There is also an open-air dance floor in the garden, and artistic lights are placed in the corners of the walls, with red and green lights reflecting each other, making it extremely quiet. It is recently heard that a gathering of distinguished guests is planned for the 14th and the grand opening on the 15th. It is expected that there will be a lot of excitement at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Squatter Settlement Crowd Incident: European Detective Case Judgement Yesterday - Hong Ali Imprisoned for Ten Months, Remaining Defendants Given Suspended Sentences <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>At 9:40 AM on the 2nd of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Yangtzepoo Police Station, went to Chaoyang Road to forcibly demolish squatter shacks at No. 488. A crowd of four to five hundred people gathered, violently resisted, and used bamboo poles, stones, and chamber pots to throw at public officials, assaulting and damaging vehicles. Subsequently, those who incited and assaulted the detectives were arrested, including Wang Lukuan from Yangzhou, Hong Ali from Juecheng (not a squatter), Sun Hankui from Jiangbei (a squatter teacher), and squatter residents Zhou Azhang from Pudong, Zhou Jinbang, and seven others who threw stones and wielded bamboo poles. Also arrested were female residents from Jiangbei, Mrs. Lou Wang and Mrs. Zhang Shi, twelve people in total (male and female), who carried chamber pots, hurled bamboo, washed and threw excrement at the detectives. They were taken to the Yangtzepoo Police Station, transferred, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and bail. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen visited the Third Criminal Court for review. SMC lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a public prosecution under Article 150 of the Criminal Code for disturbing order, and stated that during the investigation, it was discovered that defendant Hong Ali was a vagrant in the Yangtzepoo area, known for fighting, and had been handled twice before. According to the Western detective, the defendants Wang Lukuan and Hong Ali were at the scene, instigating many men and women to throw stones and excrement at detectives, according to Nos. 2044 and 1256. Chinese detectives accused defendant Zhou Azhang and Mrs. Lou Wang of using bamboo poles and chamber pots to launch and throw excrement, according to Nos. 11 and 176. Japanese detectives accused defendant Zhou Jinbang of throwing stones, and Western detective Stephen accused defendant Yang Shiyi of wielding a bamboo pole and throwing stones, according to No. 134. Western detectives accused defendant Wang Xiaosanzi of using a bamboo pole to break the lights of a motorized bicycle. Chinese detective Liu Changgen testified that defendant Sun Hankui directed many men and women to throw stones and excrement. (Defendant Gu Siming was released on bail and did not appear.) Chinese detective No. 345 and Indian detective No. 301 testified that he and defendant Gu Luotian both threw stones. Western Detective Chief Blake accused defendant Mrs. Zhang Shi of carrying a chamber pot to wash and throw excrement. Defendant Hu Guangyu, according to Indian detective No. 371, was at the scene but was not seen throwing stones, although another Indian detective saw him throw stones (but did not appear). Judge Xiao interrogated each defendant in detail and clearly, and sentenced Hong Ali to ten months imprisonment, Wang Lukuan and Sun Hankui to eight months each, with a four-year suspended sentence. Zhou Azhang, Zhou Jinbang, Yang Shiyi, Wang Xiaosanzi, Gu Luotian, Lou Wang, and Zhang Shi were each sentenced to six months, with a three-year suspended sentence. Hu Guangyu was fined twenty yuan, with a two-year suspended sentence. Gu Siming is scheduled to be sentenced at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Wang Lukuan and Sun Hankui were granted bail of 500 yuan each during the appeal period.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th of last month, at approximately 8:00 PM, a black lacquer wicker suitcase was discovered on the sidewalk in front of the English church at No. 74 Suzhou Road. Detective No. 320 from the West Third Road district inspected it and had it transported to the Central Police Station. Upon opening it, a headless female corpse was found inside, with both feet cut off, naked. She appeared to be in her twenties. The body was sent to the coroner's office, and the forensic doctor determined that she had been murdered. The corpse also had symptoms of venereal disease, as well as buboes. There were three or four small red blotches on the left shoulder, and a faint bluish-purple mark on the lower right leg, suggesting that the woman was a person from the lower classes. Because no one claimed the corpse, in addition to ordering the Pushan Cemetery to collect and bury the body, the police station was ordered to strictly apprehend the murderers. This was previously reported in this newspaper. The SMC Police Department has paid close attention since the case occurred, and has instructed all subordinate police stations to investigate strictly. After almost a month, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkew Police Station apprehended a seventeen-year-old Ningbo woman named Lin Gendi as a suspect in the case and detained her in the police station. Yesterday at noon, she was transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court and a request was made for her continued detention. Because the police station attached great importance to this case, and the main culprit was still at large, the trial was not open to the public and spectators were prohibited. Judge Zhong Qing conducted a brief interrogation and ordered her to be detained. The apprehended woman, Lin Gendi, wore a coffee-colored red-dot silk cheongsam, white socks, and fashionable shoes. Her hair was parted in two and curled, and she appeared quite modern.</p>

<p>Chen Xinyuan (also known as Yingquan), a graduate of Fudan University from Guangdong, was accused by the Old Zhabei Police Station in the First Special District Court of having sexual intercourse with a fifteen-year-old girl, Pan Anan (also known as Zhang Peifang, a dancer at the Great Metropolis Dance Hall), in violation of Article 227 of the Criminal Code. Although the complainant, Pan Qinfu, the father of the victim, withdrew the complaint, the case could not be withdrawn and continued to be heard. However, Chen Xinyuan claimed that Pan was already seventeen years old. The age of Pan was critical to determining his guilt in this case. The court ordered an adjournment for further investigation. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Chen Xinyuan, accompanied by his defense lawyer Yang Ruinian, appeared in court. Zhou Mengxiong, the principal of the "Meet for Joy" Dance School at No. 18 Huile Lane, was also summoned as a witness. Zhou testified that Pan, accompanied by her father, came to the school to learn to dance around August or September of last year for about a month. She registered under the name Pan Zhenzhen. Because the school did not focus on age, she was not required to fill out a form. However, in casual conversation, she said she was fourteen years old. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that dance halls must report the names, ages, and addresses of all dancers to the local police station on a monthly basis. Therefore, they investigated with the Jing'an Temple Police Station and found that the Great Metropolis Dance Hall reported Zhang Peifang's age as eighteen in July, with her home address as No. 18 Yongji Lane, Masnan Road, but in August, she was reported as sixteen years old. Based on past investigations, Pan's age could not be determined with certainty. Therefore, her claim to be fifteen years old was difficult to prove. Moreover, the defendant and Pan had known each other for more than a year, and their relationship only began recently. It was possible that the defendant waited for her to come of age. Therefore, it could not be said that there was no basis for the defendant's claim that she was seventeen years old. Subsequently, lawyer Yang Ruinian discussed the issue of Pan's age in detail and stated that there was no doubt that Pan was seventeen years old. He requested that the court declare him innocent. After Judge Feng reviewed the facts, he declared the verdict in court: Chen Xinyuan was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence for continuous sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of sixteen. Chen expressed his acceptance of the verdict, and police lawyer Wang also stated that he would not appeal. The case was concluded.</p>

<p>Chinese detectives Liu Junjie and Xia Shutang from the Dixwell Road Police Station apprehended a rickshaw puller from Tongzhou named Chen Huqiu at 9:10 AM on the 1st of this month, who was transporting materials for making red pills. He was carrying seven sacks of sugar powder and coffee essence, weighing 344 pounds. Interrogation revealed that a customer with the surname Zhou from the Daqing Chong Company at No. 23 Yunnan Road had hired him to take the goods to a certain place in Caojiadu, but the customer fled at the opportunity. The detectives rushed to the company and apprehended Liu Xingfu from Ningbo, seizing more than two hundred pounds of major pill ingredients, coal, gum, quinine, angelica root, and sugar powder. Chen and Liu were taken to the police station, interrogated, and detained for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. SMC lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that during the adjournment, Western doctors tested the materials and found that some could be used to manufacture red pills. He asked for a verdict. Chen Huqiu, the rickshaw puller, testified that he did not know what was in the sacks he was transporting and asked for leniency. Liu Xingfu testified that he was deceived by others. Judge Zhong sentenced Liu Xingfu to two years and six months imprisonment, and the seized items were confiscated according to the list. Chen Huqiu was released.</p>

Civil Ruling No. 9, Sheng Yi, 25th Year of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court. Bankrupt: Xu Qizhong (resident at No. 12, Lane 49, Zhejiang Road). Regarding the bankrupt's proposal of a conciliation plan for bankruptcy case No. 21, Po, 24th Year of the Republic of China, the creditors' meeting has resolved the terms of the conciliation.

Eighty creditors attended, representing a total claim amount of 20,033.97 yuan. The bankrupt proposed a conciliation plan with the following</p>
<p>Terms:</p>
<p>(1) Creditors with claims of 300 yuan or less will be repaid 40% in cash by the bankrupt's family. (2) The Wing On Real Estate Company, as a single creditor, will be compensated with the 1,000 yuan in Jiang Zhe Bank stock held as collateral. (3) Creditors with claims above 300 yuan, excluding the Wing On Real Estate Company, will be repaid proportionally from the proceeds of the auction of the bankrupt's assets and the 15,000 yuan in American Austrian Land Company stock promised by the bankrupt's family.

<p>At noon on the 8th of this month, all Chinese directors of the SMC - Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, and Xi Yushu - the directors of the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce - Ke Gan Chen and Jin Runxiang, representatives of the Taxpayers' Association - Yan Chengde, representatives of rickshaw owners - Gu Zhiling, Gu Songmao, and Hou Shaoan, representatives of rickshaw pullers - Cang Gongwen and He Wushan, and the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Taxpayers' Association, Wang Xiaolai, discussed the issue of the SMC repeatedly proposing to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession at the Taxpayers' Association. Chairman Yu Qiaqing presided, and Yan Esheng and Tao Leqin recorded the minutes. The chairman first reported the circumstances of the recent discussion by the SMC Rickshaw Special Committee on reducing the number of rickshaws in the concession. It was found that a month ago, all Chinese directors opposed it, and a majority of Western directors sympathized and opposed it. It was not passed. Recently, the chairman of the SMC, Arnold, reintroduced the old case, and after discussion, the majority still did not agree. It will be discussed again on the 14th of this month. He asked for the opinion of the attendees. Jin Runxiang, Gu Zhiling, and Jiang Yiping spoke in succession, all agreeing that the SMC's plan to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession, which disregards the legitimate business interests of the Chinese in the concession and the legitimate livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of rickshaw pullers, has existed for more than ten years. Every meeting of the board of directors has recognized that it goes against the facts and human nature, and it has not been implemented. Now, the Rickshaw Committee and the Westerners it directs, such as Mr. Bai, the principal of McLaren High School, are requesting the SMC to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession based on reports and opinions that are hostile to rickshaw businesses and prejudiced against rickshaw pullers. This is not credible. Chinese and Western directors have already passed a resolution not to discuss the issue of reducing the number of rickshaws within a year. Now, the old case has been reintroduced, and they are determined to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession without proportionally reducing other vehicles. Their proposals are not insignificant and the Board of Directors can not ignore previously agreed upon resolutions. If it is necessary to reduce the number of public rickshaws in the concession due to traffic problems, then it is only fair and impartial to wait until the traffic authorities in the concession, under unified management of traffic affairs, report the facts regarding the obstruction of traffic by all types of vehicles before considering whether the number of public rickshaws in the concession should be reduced. Now, the Rickshaw Committee is destroying the legitimate businesses of the Chinese and cutting off the livelihoods of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers by organizing a rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association. It is necessary to request that all Chinese</p>

<p>The Hengtongxiang Suitcase Shop at No. 313 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession and the Wuhonglong Suitcase Shop at No. 344 in the Public Concession were both previously opened by Ren Liqun from Jiangxi. Later, Wuhonglong was managed by Ren's wife, Mrs. Wang. Recently, Ren Liqun, suspecting his wife of having an affair with the accountant Wei Rongshou, went to catch them in the act on the 2nd of this month. A struggle ensued, and Ren was stabbed with scissors. The Chinese police investigated and detained Ren, Mrs. Wang, and Wei Rongshou, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shewo appeared in court to defend the defendants. Apprentice Chen Changsheng testified that his previous testimony regarding seeing the two defendants joking and the wife's clothes being unbuttoned was not true. Ren Liqun had approached him before the last court hearing, promising to pay him 20 yuan and teaching him what to say. Today, his conscience was clear, and he was telling the truth. Wei Rongshou had just finished his accounts that night and was bandaging his infected foot in the shop, while the wife was sitting on the side, fully clothed, and there was no illegal behavior. Chinese detective No. 1660 also testified that when the suspects were arrested, their clothes were tidy. After Judge Zhan interrogated them separately, he discovered that Ren Liqun's testimony did not match the facts. The court ruled that Wei Rongshou was guilty of causing bodily harm and fined him 20 yuan. The adultery charges were dismissed, and Mrs. Ren Wang was found not guilty. The plaintiff's related civil suit was dismissed. directors negotiate with the SMC, reorganize the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, abolish the Rickshaw Committee, and oppose the reduction of rickshaws that endangers the livelihoods of tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers. All Chinese directors should accept the public's opinion and negotiate with Arnold, the chairman of the SMC Board of Directors, at 3:30 PM this afternoon. It is said that Mr. Arnold, recognizing that it is difficult to go against public opinion, has expressed his willingness to reorganize the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association and the Rickshaw Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Former Director of the Gansu Opium Prohibition Bureau, Xu Xueseng, Injured by Acid Attack; Many People Involved in the Case; Plaintiff Detained in Another Case <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xueseng, a native of Songjiang and former director of the Gansu Opium Prohibition Bureau, was attacked with nitric and hydrochloric acid on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession on the afternoon of March 6th of this year, causing injuries to his face. The perpetrator, Gao Jinsheng, was apprehended at the scene. After investigation by the Special Second Court, Gao Jinsheng was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, Xu Xueseng filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing fellow townsmen Zhu Guanghan and Chen Axi of</p>
<p>Inciting Assault</p>
<p>and other allegations. Judge Qin Zhi conducted several hearings without a conclusion. These details have been reported in previous issues. It is now learned that Judge Yu Lide specially convened the Third Court yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM for a renewed trial of this case. The plaintiff, Xu Xueseng, arrived in court accompanied by his attorney, Wen Chao. The defendant, Zhu Guanghan, was represented by attorney Gu Changyuan. The second defendant, Chen Axi, was defended by attorneys Ding Zhu and He Xianzhang. First, Xu Xueseng testified, stating he was 45 years old and from Songjiang. He was asked: "Do you have evidence to accuse Zhu Guanghan and Chen Axi of assault?"</p>
<p>"Is there any basis?"</p>
<p>He replied: "On March 6th of this year, at 8:00 PM, while I was bathing, the assailant Gao Jinsheng rode up on a bicycle and poured nitric and hydrochloric acid on me, injuring me. The assailant was apprehended on the spot and has already been sentenced by the Special Second District Court. Wu Zhengxiang informed me that Zhu Guanghan was very dissatisfied with me. I recall that on December 28th of last year, I was also beaten. Perhaps Zhu Guanghan and others instigated that as well. Attorney Chen Wen came to</p>
<p>mediate with me</p>
<p>but I did not agree. Therefore, I have resorted to the law." He was asked: "Why did you not sue Zhu Guanghan and others at that time?" He replied: "Because attorney Gu Changyuan repeatedly contacted me for negotiations, etc." Next, Zhu Guanghan testified, stating he was 42 years old, from Songjiang, and residing on Fuxu Road. He came to Shanghai because his mother was ill and he was seeking medical treatment. He traveled between Songjiang and Shanghai, but mostly resided in Songjiang. He said he was unjustly accused of incitement to assault by Xu Xueseng. He was asked: "Are you and Xu Xueseng sworn brothers?" He replied: "Yes, we became sworn brothers in Shanghai, approximately</p>
<p>ten years ago."</p>
<p>He was asked: "Since you are sworn brothers, why is he suing you?" He replied: "Previously, I lost over ten thousand yuan due to the bankruptcy of the Songjiang Bank. Xu handled the matter on my behalf, negotiating with the bank for compensation, but without results. He borrowed three hundred yuan and six hundred yuan from me, and perhaps other amounts that I do not clearly remember." He was asked: "Do you know Chen Axi?" He replied: "I do not know him." He was asked: "Did you ask attorney Gu Changyuan to reconcile the matter with attorney Zhang Shizhao?" He replied: "That did not happen." At this point, attorney Gu stated that he was</p>
<p>in contact regarding another case.</p>
<p>Zhang asked me if I knew Zhu. I said I knew him. Xu Xueseng told Zhang that I and Zhu had always known each other and asked me to mediate. I said I do not handle criminal cases. Around 2:00 or 3:00 PM, I went to Jiang Weicheng's house. When I arrived at Jiang's house, Detective Feng Ziming was also there. Jiang said</p>
<p>Xu Xueseng's matter</p>
<p>had already occurred. After Zhu Guanghan's concubine died, he had a disagreement with Xu. Feng told me, "You know Xu Xueseng. Why not ask you to mediate?" So I went to visit Xu Xueseng and talked about reconciliation. Xu said he had one wife and two concubines, with monthly expenses of five hundred yuan. He is 45 years old this year, so up to the age of 60, if he wants to reconcile, he must have</p>
<p>ninety-six thousand</p>
<p>yuan." Later, Detective Feng said the amount was too large and difficult to approach. Even at fifty yuan per month, it would still require nine thousand six hundred yuan, totaling ten thousand yuan. I went to the hospital again and negotiated with Xu, but Xu did not agree. On the day of the trial, Zhu Guanghan went to Feng Ziming's house and claimed that he had only raised two thousand yuan. If more was needed, he could not provide it. Feng then</p>
<p>telephoned</p>
<p>me. Later, Xu Xueseng hired attorney Zhang Shizhao to file a lawsuit with the court, etc." Finally, witnesses Fu Xinquan, Xu Xiaosan, Chen Lang, etc., testified. The judge, noting that it was already late in the evening, adjourned the hearing to a later date. Chen Axi was sent back to Xin Puyu Hall for medical treatment due to illness. Gao Jinsheng was ordered to be detained and sent back to the Third Branch Court the next day. Xu Xueseng was detained in another case. By the time the court adjourned, it was already dark.</p>

<p>Over seventy businesses on Hujiaqiao Road in the city, including Tongshenmao, Tiansheng, Zengda, Yongshengtai, Nanyang, Taichang, Guangchang, etc., jointly submitted a petition yesterday to the Public Security, Health, Finance, Social Affairs, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus, requesting the relocation of vegetable stalls to maintain the commercial district. The petition to Public Security Director Zhou Wenzhao is recorded as follows: "Petition regarding the decline of the market, the difficulty of maintaining business, and the request to move the Tianbao Branch Road vegetable market to this road for the mutual benefit of merchants and vendors. The undersigned businesses are all located along Hujiaqiao Road, engaged in commerce. However, business is uneven. Since January 28th, the market has been declining year by year. Furthermore, the economic panic has caused many businesses on this road to be unable to sustain themselves. Many storefronts are vacant. If there is no rescue method, we will inevitably be doomed. We understand that the Tianbao Branch Road vegetable market has been instructed by your bureau to relocate to the Tiande Road area. Although this is being implemented, the vendors believe that the Tiande Road area is remote and that their livelihood is difficult. They have requested relocation to this road, and several petitions have been filed but not approved. Therefore, the undersigned businesses, for the sake of maintaining the market, in addition to submitting petitions to the Health, Finance, Social Affairs, Public Works, and Public Utilities Bureaus, and the Linping Road Police Station, dare to request your Excellency's inspection and approval to relocate the Tianbao Road vegetable market to the Hujia Road area, from Xiangyan Bridge to Tiantong Road Bridge, for the benefit of both vendors and businesses. The Hujiaqiao Road area is neither a major thoroughfare nor has any other obstructions. If you approve, we will be immensely grateful." Respectfully presented to Cai, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>The paralyzed child mentioned in yesterday's newspaper, who was abandoned by his mother in front of the Renji Hospital, has reportedly been taken in by the Sacred Heart Hospital in Yangshupu, run by the Catholic Church. Therefore, the child now has a place to stay. However, because his body is unable to move from the waist down, it is ultimately difficult to cure him completely. Also, in yesterday's subheading ("The Municipal Council and the Court have no means of relief"), the character "及" (and) was mistakenly printed as "立" (stand). This is corrected here.</p>

<p>At approximately 9:40 PM yesterday, a customer suddenly arrived at the Fifth Branch of the Xiangsheng Automobile Company on Haining Road, intending to go to Qimei Road in Zhabei. The accountant instructed the driver, Du Haigen, a local resident (32 years old), company number 216, to drive a No. 18523 taxi. After the customer boarded, they drove straight to the vicinity of the Pingmin Village on the Second Foreign Bridge on Qimei Road. Unexpectedly, three bandits emerged from the side of the road, blocking their progress and threatening them with guns. However, the driver, Du Haigen, did not give in to their demands and accelerated forward. The bandits were furious and fired a shot, hitting the from Long-term consultations, and the Municipal Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau held talks to resolve the factory strike at the Social Bureau in the morning.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Garrison</p>
<p>After workers in the British, American, and Japanese factories went on strike, the Public Concession sent a large number of detectives, stationed in shifts inside the factories to protect them. Now that all the workers have automatically resumed work, the detectives stationed there all withdrew from the factories at 10:30 AM.</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Hongxing Sock Factory on Caishi Road in the French Concession has over 400 male and female workers. Previously, due to opposition to the factory's deduction of wages, they jointly organized a branch. The factory misunderstood and announced an indefinite suspension of work at the end of June during the final accounting period, causing panic among all the workers. They petitioned party and government agencies for assistance. After mediation, the eight cadres of the branch, including Deng Yixin, voluntarily resigned, and the issue was resolved. However, the factory's female worker Li Asi had a conflict with Wang Xiuying the day before yesterday, and the factory director Ge Shousheng, after hearing one-sided remarks, dismissed Wang Xiuying. All the workers believed that Li Asi had been used by the factory in the past to sabotage the labor union. To resolve the dispute, the factory should have dismissed both female workers at the same time, but the factory refused this request and moved Wang Xiuying's machine. When the female workers entered the factory yesterday morning, they were furious. They demanded an explanation from the factory but received no results, and a dispute arose.</p>
<p>Conflict Occurs</p>
<p>At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the factory, seeing the large number of workers and the serious situation, immediately closed the factory doors. At the same time, factory staff members Xia Depei, Le Runtin, Shi Jifu, and others grabbed the hair of female workers Wang Xiuying, Zhang Xiuying, and Zhou Linbao in the crowd and dragged them to the accounting room. Other workers, hearing the news, rushed forward to rescue them, resulting in a conflict. As a result, female worker Sheng Wenxiu had a piece of flesh bitten off by Le Runtin, and blood was gushing, a terrible sight. The police arrived and sent Sheng Wenxiu to the hospital. The other female workers Wang Xiumei, Zhang Xiuying, and Zhou Linbao were also seriously injured, but the factory refused to send them to the hospital and confined them in the factory. Other victims included Wu Wanzhen, Lu Qinxiang, Zhang Fengxian, Lu Jinmei, Chen Zhaodi, Kang Xiuzhen, Wei Xingxian, Sun Aju, Zhou Ermei, Zhang Huizhen, Wang Chunmei, Zhu Xinghua, Ge Wangshu, etc., but their injuries were minor and not serious.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>After the incident occurred, the French Concession police sent a large number of detectives to suppress the situation. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union also sent Li Weixiong and Wan Banghe to the factory to investigate thoroughly and persuade both parties to wait for a resolution and not allow the situation to escalate further. The seriously injured female workers Wang Xiuying, Zhang Xiuying, and Zhou Linbao were not sent to the hospital due to the factory's refusal, and they are still lying in the factory's alleyway, unable to sit up.</p>

<p>Huang Linxi, 32 years old, from Changzhou, was a mason living at No. 18, Baiyu Lane, No. 313, Mabaishi Road. Recently, Huang and his friend Chen Linhai planned to jointly open a storytelling venue, but later disagreed. Huang cooperated with others, causing Chen to harbor resentment. On the night of the 25th of last month, Chen invited accomplices in Caoxiebang Lane, Yideng Road, to kill Huang Linxi with an axe. The police arrested the perpetrators, Lu Awei and Zhao Awei, both from Ningbo, on the spot and seized two axes. However, the main culprit Chen Linhai and others escaped. The two men, Lu and Zhao, were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng announced the verdict in the Eighth Criminal Court. Lu Awei and Zhao Awei were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment for joint murder, and the two axes were confiscated. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. Talk of the, he refused. The judge ordered Chen Axi, 35 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 328, Guling Road, to be brought to court. He was asked: "Do you also go by the name Chen Zigao?" He replied: "No." He was asked: "Do you also go by the name Han Laosi?" He replied: "No." He was asked: "How did Xu Xueseng accuse you?" He replied: "In February of this year, Xu Xueseng was at the Shenzhou Hotel. I</p>
<p>lit Xu's cigarettes,</p>
<p>that's how I know him. Around March 7th or 8th of this year, Xu Xueseng ordered me to go to Guangci Hospital and tell me that Zhu Guanghan incited someone to pour nitric and hydrochloric acid. I didn't agree. Moreover, I don't know Zhu Guanghan." He was asked: "Did you order Gao Yusheng to pour it?" He replied: "No." The official said: "Gao Jinsheng said that Han Laosi ordered him to pour it." He replied: "I</p>
<p>know nothing."</p>
<p>The judge ordered Gao Jinsheng to be brought to court and stated that he lived in Nanyang Fan and opened a bicycle shop. The Special Second Court sentenced me to four years. I didn't accept it and appealed to the Third Branch Court, but the original verdict was upheld. I have now appealed to the Supreme Court. He was asked: "When the incident happened, I was riding a bicycle from west to east, and Xu Xueseng was going from east to west when the bicycle collided and I fell to the ground first. The yellow</p>
<p>nitric acid overturned</p>
<p>and I was also injured." He was asked: "Why did you say that Han Laosi ordered you to pour it?" He replied: "I couldn't bear the hardship in the police station and made a random confession. There is no such person as Han Laosi. You can investigate it." At this point, lawyer Chen Wen testified that after the incident on March 6th, Xiao Ronggen notified me on the 8th and asked me to go to the hospital to see Xu Xueseng. Because it was 3:00 or 4:00 PM, the hospital's regulations stated that visiting hours had passed, so I didn't go. By the day of the trial, he called with his right hand and blood was flowing. The car still flew across and the thieves had no choice but to flee into the darkness. The injured Du Haigen drove the car to Shanghai and went directly to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>According to the Public News Agency, all the striking workers at the Third Factory of the British American Tobacco Company (i.e., Zhongyuan Tobacco Company) on Daopeng Road in Pudong, Shanghai, resumed work in the factory yesterday morning after being persuaded by members of the Municipal General Labor Union. The conditions requested will be negotiated voluntarily by both parties. All Chinese and Western detectives stationed in the factory have been withdrawn. The labor unrest that has lasted for more than twenty days can be temporarily resolved. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Representatives of each department representing all the workers in the factory, after being earnestly persuaded by members of the Municipal General Labor Union, immediately notified the workers to resume work overnight. All the workers successively entered the factory to resume work at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. At the same time, the factory also sounded the whistle to start work. The order was very good when the workers entered the factory to resume work. The factory also expressed its gratification at the workers' resumption of work.</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>Regarding the eight demands put forward by the labor side, the labor and management sides agreed to hold consultations at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, with several responsible representatives elected by the labor side and the English supervisor of the big gang, Hubrook. As a result, the labor side retreated on the personnel part (i.e., Wei Ziqian), but the factory admitted to reinstating the dismissed female workers. Regarding the request for leave procedures and wages during the dispute period, the factory agreed to allow Zhejiang Province to formulate silk control and management committees to supplement the silkworm industry funds, which would be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and the Executive Yuan for approval. The improved seed fresh cocoons produced in this province would be charged an improvement fee of 1.8 yuan per ancestral seed. Now, in order to standardize the price of silkworm seeds and increase the advance payment, the improved seed fresh cocoon seed funds and improvement fees have been submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for approval, and the levy has been increased to 2 yuan per ancestral seed, which was implemented starting in the summer. The autumn fresh cocoons will be on the market soon, and the summer method of levying an improvement fee of 2 yuan per dan of improved seed fresh cocoons will still be followed. According to Xin Xin News Agency reporters, the Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhejiang silk factory associations believe that the cocoon industry has not recovered, and the improvement fees are still increasing, which silk cocoon manufacturers will not be able to afford. The joint meeting of cocoon vocational associations in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces decided to request the Zhejiang Provincial Government to exempt them, and it is learned that the manufacturers specially appointed Chen Dongshi, Xu Xingbin, and Zhou Yangsong to contact the Zhejiang Provincial Silkworm Silk Control Association to register the number of cocoons received, which should be based on the total registered dan number of the cocoon merchants, not on the individual cocoon lines, so that when the cocoon is abundantly harvested, it can be calculated in a unified manner. cocoon panicle lack, the number of cocoons varies from place to place, and it is difficult to obtain accurate numbers in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Letter <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>I checked today (9th), the news published in the newspapers about the resumption of work of the workers in the Zhongyan Tobacco Factory, and the truth of the facts are quite different. This time, in addition to the fact that the Bureau had approved the order early on, when the union representative Zhou Yuxiang and others went to the municipal government yesterday (8th), Secretary-General Yu cutely told them in person. It is the most important reason for promoting the resumption of work of the factory workers. The previous process has not been described, and should be corrected to avoid misunderstandings. The so-called second convocation of mediation at 9 am today (9th) is even more untrue. The Director of this Bureau is deeply concerned that the expansion of the factory's labor unrest may affect public security, so he ordered the person in charge of the section to telegraph Zhou Xuexiang of the Fourth District Rolled Tobacco Industry Union to come to the Bureau this morning (9th) to urge him to persuade the workers to resume work first and wait for mediation, not to convene mediation. A special letter is hereby requested for correction to clarify the details. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, September 9,</p>
<p>Directly, I checked the news carried in your newspaper on August 28 about the Chamber of Intestines' petition to the Ministry of Finance to stop the two factories from cheating, accusing this firm's Dinghai branch of carrying private salt when shipping sausage casings. How alarmed I am. All the sausage casings made by our factory are shipped overseas. To prevent them from rotting, they must be salted. According to the regulations of the International Trade Bureau of the Shanghai Industrial Department, each pig intestine needs 5 shi dan to 6 shi dan of salt for 1,500 pairs of pig intestines, 13.5 yards per pair, or 1,250 pairs, 27 yards per pair, or 340 pairs, 100 yards per pair. On August 23, someone falsely reported to the second district of the Suwu tax police bureau, and then took away many barrels of goods shipped by our factory to Shanghai for inspection. As a result of the inspection, barrel No. 83 contained 2,850 pairs of pig intestines, with only 105 jin of pickled salt used, which is far from the amount of salt that should be used. It was sent back by the section, and the suspicion of carrying private salt was pure slander. Furthermore, our industry has not heard of the organization of a peer association. According to the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview compiled by the Shanghai China Credit Institute, there are only four Chinese peers in our industry, in addition to our factory and Chengda, there are now only Gongji, Bairan, Zhonghua, and Shenji. According to Article 3 of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law, the establishment of a trade association must be initiated by seven or more companies and firms in the same industry before it can be established in accordance with the law. As for the so-called Shanghai Intestine Industry Association, our factory belongs to the same industry. Where has the association been established and where is it located? , so far I have not heard of it. However, it has been pointed out that our factory established a factory in Dinghai to marinate sausage casings, which is said to be carrying private salt, which is obviously intended to undermine our factory's business. In addition to investigating in accordance with the law, a corresponding letter is hereby requested. Your newspaper will publish this letter in the letter column in lieu of correction.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center, in order to promote frugality and advocate a new lifestyle, began preparing a frugality exhibition. Originally scheduled to open on the 1st, it was postponed due to insufficient preparation. It is now known that the exhibits, such as models, charts, statistics, and photographs, have been fully collected and a decision was made to open on the 15th of this month. The exhibition period is scheduled for two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Last Four Years (4) of Central University <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>Regarding equipment, from September of the 21st year to June of the 23rd year, the actual expenditure was 246,819 yuan. From July of the 23rd year to June of the 25th year, the actual expenditure was 589,578 yuan. Chemical reagents, etc., listed under consumables, were not included. Therefore, the actual expenditure on equipment in four years reached 836,397 yuan. In total, the actual expenditure on books and equipment in the past four years has reached 1,207,042 yuan. Adding the cost of construction, books and equipment, the total expenditure in the past four years is 1,876,030 yuan.</p>
<p>5.  Implement Streamlining and Savings in Administrative Expenses for Construction</p>
<p>The school's funding has been reduced after reorganization and has not increased in the past four years. If construction is desired, it is necessary to reduce personnel and save administrative expenses. After four years of effort, there have been some minor but observable effects. The number of staff in the 24th year was reduced by 76 compared to the 18th year and by 72 compared to the 19th year (the number of staff in the former medical and business colleges has been removed, while the current medical college and dental specialty school staff have been included). Due to further streamlining in the 24th year, the actual reduction compared to the 23rd year was 13 people. As for the number of teachers (including professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants), the number in the 24th year was reduced by 62 compared to the 18th year and by 85 compared to the 19th year. As for administrative expenses, there is no way to verify the figures for the 18th and 19th years, and the numbers are difficult to track down. After the reorganization in the 21st year, there was a major reduction. From the 21st year to the 24th year, the pressure gradually tightened, and there were some results. Administrative expenses accounted for 10.5% of the total budget in the 21st year, reduced to 9.5% in the 22nd year, 9% in the 23rd year, and 8% in the 24th year. These results all came from gradual accumulation over time. From the 21st year to the 23rd year, the school was able to achieve the above-mentioned construction without receiving special funding, which was not without reason.</p>
<p>6.  Reorganizing Curriculum</p>
<p>University curriculum in our country is often filled with numerous courses, lacking an organic structure. The school's various departments have separately redefined educational guidelines and reorganized the curriculum, so that required and elective courses have clear regulations and are not changed due to individuals or events. Once the core of the curriculum is formed, the meaning of teaching can be clarified. Thanks to the efforts and assistance of the deans, department heads, and professors, this work was largely completed after a long period of discussion lasting a year. Afterwards, it was revised from time to time based on actual situations. The types of courses have been deleted and merged in many places, and efforts have been made to enrich the content.</p>
<p>In the 24th year, the school added a medical college, a dental specialty school, and a special mechanical research class. The curriculum settings were all based on the standards issued by the Ministry, the curriculum settings of the relevant departments of universities abroad, and the actual needs of the country were carefully formulated, making the whole school's curriculum an organic link.</p>
<p>7.  Concentrating Scholars and Emphasizing Full-Time Positions</p>
<p>Scholarship is inherently a specialized undertaking, and those who serve as professors should devote themselves to it wholeheartedly. The school has often felt empty due to years of chaos. At the beginning of the reorganization, it made every effort to retain the original good professors and recruited specialized scholars from time to time. Over the years, many professors and lecturers have been added successively, and the faculty of each department has been largely filled. In the future, we will continue to pay attention at any time and attract talents from all sides, so that the school can become a general gathering of various academic and specialized talents. At the same time, it is even more important to establish a principle of never hiring part-time staff when full-time staff can be hired. The results of the implementation have been quite effective. In the past, the school had as many as 111 part-time teachers. After Jialun arrived at the school, he worked hard to reduce them. In the 21st year, there were 81 part-time teachers, which was reduced to 80 in the 22nd year, 75 in the 23rd year, and only 34 in the 24th year. These few part-time teachers are all experts in certain special sciences and are relied upon by the government or other academic institutions. The school wants to recruit them, but it is impossible in reality. It is deeply grateful to them for sharing a portion of their energy and time to assist the school. From the 15th year onwards, all grades were complete, and the increase or decrease of courses was mostly undertaken by the original teachers, whose enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>8.  Emphasizing Moral Education (1) Establishing a Moral Education Committee</p>
<p>In recent years, university education in the country has mostly focused on the infusion of knowledge while neglecting the cultivation of students' character. The school, aware of this, is striving to correct this error. Usually, appropriate guidance is given to students' extracurricular activities and daily life. Over the past four years, thanks to the effective teaching of the professors and the students' self-improvement, the school's atmosphere has changed greatly, and the school's reputation has gradually increased. In order to unify the direction of moral education, a Moral Education Committee was established last September to coordinate all moral education matters. All matters such as formulating various moral education regulations, guiding students' extracurricular activities, evaluating students' conduct grades, reviewing student rewards and punishments, and assisting military management are all handled by the committee, so that students' pursuit of knowledge and cultivation of personality, as well as the habit of group life, can be developed in a balanced way, so as to cultivate a good academic atmosphere and healthy citizens.</p>
<p>(2) Implementing Military Management In order to cultivate students' militarized life, disciplined action, and unified spirit, the school has implemented military management since the 24th year. First-year students who are currently receiving military training are all wearing uniforms and are subject to military management. Military management regulations have been formulated, a military management office has been organized, and a moral education committee and a brigade headquarters have been established to handle all training management and moral education matters.

<p>Registration for this year's Shanghai West United Football Club ended the day before yesterday. A total of 40 teams participated. The detailed order will have to wait until the new executive committee is formed before it can be arranged. The complete list is still being compiled. Last year, there were a total of 58 teams in each group. This year, there are 18 fewer teams. After the new plan is implemented, there will be no danger of repeating last year's failure to finish on schedule. As for the new Chinese member teams, there are Jinan, Shuxing, Dongguang, Bank of Communications, Jinde, and Nie Zhongcheng teams. Jinan withdrew last year due to some reason. This year, because Youyou has become scattered, most of the athletes are from Jinan University, so Jinan's strength this year will be stronger than before, because its organization will be based on Youyou athletes. The annual meeting of this year has been set for 5:15 PM this afternoon at the Western Children's Public School at No. 29 Jiangxi Road. The agenda was published in yesterday's newspaper. According to the most important matter of the annual meeting, it is to discuss the reorganization of this year's league organization. It will probably pass the plan on the notice issued by the association on the 17th of last month (that is, dividing it into three groups, A, B, and C, plus a preliminary round and a morning league). As for Davison's complex management system plan, it is feared that it will be rejected again this year.

<p>Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him and talked about the performance of our country's national arts at the World Games. The situation is briefly described as follows: Although we did not get a score, this trip was originally for sightseeing, so we should be able to seek progress through comparison. Among them, the national arts also performed at the conference and in various places, which won a good reputation and was comforting. He also showed a letter from a member from Germany, which described the experience in detail. The following is an excerpt: (Omitted above) The World Games started on August 2nd. Our country's sports all fell behind. On the day the national arts team arrived in Berlin, the entire German Student Association accompanied them to Hamburg to participate in the World Music, Art, and Martial Arts performances. As a result of our performance, we won the welcome of tens of thousands of spectators. On July 27th, we also performed national arts and Tai Chi exercises and Tai Chi balls at the welcome meeting for overseas Chinese students in Berlin, and distributed hundreds of copies of Tai Chi exercise publications. Many German military and political dignitaries attended the meeting that day. The news was published in the newspapers on the same day, with many praises. Later, they went to German military camps to perform various boxing techniques. German soldiers and officials unanimously praised them and distributed Tai Chi exercise publications to them. On August 11th, our national arts team officially performed at the conference. First, there was a group Tai Chi exercise, followed by individual boxing and pair boxing by each member, and finally a weapon performance, all of which were very exciting and won the appreciation of tens of thousands of spectators, with applause and cheers lasting for a long time. On the 17th, Cheng Tian'en sent off all the members. During the meeting, Ding Junwenyuan, on behalf of Mr. Wang Rutang, proposed to send the national arts team to various places to perform, scheduled to meet in Italy on September 1st, and explained that many places had sent letters requesting performances, and the expenses would be borne by the inviters. Ambassador Cheng and Dean Dai both attached Qian and gave instructions in person. The national arts comrades were all happy to go to promote the national light. On the 18th, the General Association of European Students held an annual meeting in Salo. Dean Dai publicly banqueted all the athletes and students. Many Chinese and Western guests attended. There was Peking Opera that day, and the national arts team performed again. The association also made and presented medals as souvenirs. Two kinds of Tai Chi exercise publications, in addition to being distributed to foreign guests during past performances, the rest were kept by the embassy and forwarded to libraries and foreign guests in various countries. The national arts team has two sets of weapons. The new ones were kept by Ambassador Cheng for display in the embassy, and the Tai Chi balls were planned by the angel to be transferred to the German Sports Hall. The sports film was also kept by the embassy for screening. Tai Chi exercises are novel in theory, and people from various countries come to ask for publications every day, which shows that foreigners are gradually understanding national arts. The national arts team left the German military camp on the 20th and will go to other places to perform. The commander of the German military camp also held a farewell banquet and sent off the team with a band upon departure, which was very touching. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>Swimming</p>
<p>The swimming pool is built next to the main venue, extremely magnificent, accommodating more than 100 people. The eighth day of the Games saw the track and field events coming to a close, and swimming began. The spectators were more crowded than in the main venue. The first day of events included the men's 100-meter freestyle preliminary rounds and the women's 200-meter breaststroke preliminary rounds in the morning, and the men's 100-meter freestyle semi-finals and the women's 100-meter freestyle preliminary rounds in the afternoon. The results were excellent, and almost all existing tournament records were shattered. Among the participating countries, Japan showed the most impressive momentum, with a strong possibility of ascending to the throne of swimming. The United States experienced a significant decline, and it seems unlikely that they will be able to reclaim their titles at this Games. The results of each event are as follows:</p>
<p>Men's 100-meter Freestyle Preliminary and Semi-Final Rounds At 9:00 AM, swimming began with the first event, the men's 100-meter freestyle preliminary rounds. There were seven groups, with eight participants in the first two groups and seven participants in the remaining groups. The top two from each group and the two fastest third-place finishers from all groups advanced to the semi-finals. Our country's athlete Chen Zhenxing, although finishing fourth in the first group, was only about seven or eight meters behind. The best time among all groups was achieved by Japan's Taguchi Masaharu in the fifth group, with 57.5 seconds, breaking the tournament record (58 seconds set by Japan's Miyazaki Koji at the previous Games). The times of 57.7 seconds by the United States' Fick in the first group, 57.8 seconds by Japan's Yusa Masanori in the second group, 57.7 seconds by Japan's Arai Shigeo in the fourth group, and 57.9 seconds by Germany's Fissell were all below the Olympic record. The three participating athletes from Japan not only led the field but also achieved excellent results, displaying formidable strength.</p>
<p>First Group 1st Fick (USA) 57.7 seconds, New Olympic Record, 2nd Csik (Hungary) 58.3 seconds</p>
<p>Second Group 1st Yusa Masanori (Japan) 57.8 seconds, New Olympic Record, 2nd Hollander (USA) 59.9 seconds</p>

<p>Seventh Group 1st Littel (USA) 58.3 seconds, 2nd Abay Nemes (Hungary) 1 minute 0.2 seconds</p>
<p>The two fastest third-place finishers to advance to the semi-finals were Australia's Candell from the second group with a time of 1 minute 1 second, and Finland's Heitan from the seventh group with a time of 1 minute 1 second.</p>
<p>At 3:50 PM, the semi-finals were held in two groups, with eight participants each. The top three from each group advanced. As a result, the three Japanese athletes led the way in both groups. Yusa Masanori also achieved an excellent time of 57.5 seconds. The United States' Hollander was surprisingly eliminated in the second group, and Hungary's Csik surpassed Fick in the first group, which was unexpected. The results of the two groups are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group</p>
<p>1st Taguchi Masaharu (Japan) 57.9 seconds, New Olympic Record</p>
<p>2nd Csik (Hungary) 58.1 seconds</p>

Seven people participated in the first group, and six people participated in the remaining groups. The top three finishers, and the two fastest fourth-place finishers advanced to the semi-finals. In the third group, Japan's Maehata Hideko was agile, pulling three meters ahead of the second-place finisher at the finish line, with a time of 3 minutes 1.9 seconds, breaking the Olympic record (3 minutes 6.3 seconds set by Australia's Dennis in 1932) and approaching the world record (3 minutes 0.4 seconds set by Japan's Maehata Hideko in 1933). In the second group, German athlete Hehn also broke the Olympic record.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Finance – HSBC Shilling Drops Below Statutory Level – Call Money Briefly Surges – Banks Forcefully Stem the Tide and Gradually Stabilize – Result: Rebounds by $1.80 <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The gold market initially weakened due to pure gold downstream yesterday. Surprisingly, the market suddenly became sluggish. Unexpectedly, HSBC's shilling listing declined, stimulating buying interest and a sharp rise in prices. Fortunately, banks forcefully stemmed the tide and gradually stabilized the situation. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw the British market rise and the American market remain flat. Some market commentators claimed that after the market closed, there were only a few buyers below 0.0625, and that the market would be weak at the close. Montevideo forward silver prices rose by 2%. Exchange rates all showed an increase. London spot gold plummeted by 3 pence. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement revealed a half-and-half split between the British and American currencies. The customs gold unit fell by 4%. The standard call money price listing fell to $1,121.20. Off-market forward trading opened lower at $23.78. Although Hengyu advanced to over $4, Chunyuan, Yongyuan, Mao, Yongda, and Decheng liquidated their holdings. The morning opened with a low trading level, but quickly stabilized, as large investors took the opportunity to buy low. However, the market was still struggling. When HSBC's exchange rate listing was announced, the British currency shrank by 1.25, while the American currency rose by 1.25. The British exchange rate had decreased to 1 shilling, 2 and 25/100 pence. People's confidence in the Central Bank's ability to maintain foreign exchange rates suddenly experienced a degree of fear. This stimulated buying demand. Buyers rushed to buy, one after another, causing a gradual increase in prices. The banks were forced to sell foreign exchange to counter the buying and sellers were active at higher prices. A storm gradually subsided, but the market still struggled. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $1,123.90, a decrease of $1.30 from the previous closing price. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yonghui, Xiangfu, Danda Natiao rose from $3.80 to $4.70. Chengda liquidated their holdings, retreating to $4.40. HSBC's listing revealed that the British currency shrank while the American currency rose by 1.25. Market sentiment quickly turned bullish. Huixiang, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Yufu, Taiyong, Fuxingyong, Yongnatiao immediately rose to $7.70. Chengda, Chunyuan, Qiafeng, Yongda, and Decheng sold off, falling to $6.00. Dadecheng, Dada, Heng, Yuanmao, Yongfuxingyong, and Hengyu still competed to buy, further rising to $9.50. Banks eagerly supplied foreign exchange. Chunyuan, Yongqiafeng, Yongfuxingyong took advantage of high prices, falling to $7.50. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Hengchangyong re-entered, rising to $8.40. Shenkang, Hengyu, and Chunyuanyong sold again, retreating to $7.20. Dahengfuxingyong took the opportunity to buy at low prices, rising back to $8.10. Shenkang advanced and emerged again. Dadecheng Yuanmaoyong also sold, with speculative downward pressure falling to $6.40. Retail investors and Qiafengyong repurchased, rising back to $7.11.

<p>In the previous day's report, Da Feng Shuang entered 17,1910 packages, priced at 670 yuan, which was a duplicate of the report on the 5th. Furthermore, according to a letter from Da Feng Foreign Firm, "On the 6th, your newspaper published that our firm purchased 30 packages of grade B, 20-22 stripe fabric, priced at 615 yuan, and 10 packages of grade 5, 13-15 stripe fabric, priced at 655 yuan. Upon investigation, our firm did not purchase the above items on that day. The news is inaccurate. We request you to make a correction on our behalf. Thank you."</p>
<p>Editor's Note: This newspaper, recognizing that the information reported is difficult to ascertain accurately, thereby failing to meet the expectations of the readers, is striving to reorganize, aiming for more reliable and trustworthy news to provide readers with reference. However, silk market transactions are scattered, and information on market conditions and quantities is kept secret. Even well-informed correspondents sometimes find it difficult to know everything. The difficulty of this undertaking is evident. This newspaper is aware of the difficulty but still strives diligently to achieve it. The silk market conditions reported over the years, while not entirely satisfactory, are generally known to the readers. Fearing that there might be omissions, we sometimes use two reports to avoid being insufficiently detailed, preferring to err on the side of excess rather than deficiency. In the future, we still hope that people in the silk industry will provide assistance at any time to help achieve the purpose of this newspaper. Thank you very much.</p>

<h3 id="e181">After the Second Estimate of American Cotton Sharply Decreased, Standard Cotton Soars by One Dollar. Heavy Rain All Day Makes People Feel More Active. <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Market Soars: Due to the Second Estimate Report of American Cotton, which showed a sharper-than-expected decrease, it soared by 51 to 63 points per pound. Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton rose by one dollar and fifty-six cents to over two dollars. Consequently, the market was shaken. At the same time, the weather was adverse, with continuous rainfall. Currently, cotton is in the boll-opening stage, which has a significant impact, making people feel more active and boosting buying interest. All months rose by eighty cents to one dollar.</p>
<p>Forward Contracts Break the Forty Dollar Barrier</p>
<p>The forward cotton market opened due to the publication of the American cotton second estimate report, which reported a volume of 11,121,000 bales, a sharp decrease of 1,360,000 bales compared to the previous estimate, rising 51 to 63 points per pound. Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton rose by over two dollars. As a result, the market was shaken, short sellers painfully closed their positions, and bulls increased their bets. Both sides advanced side by side, pushing market prices soaring. Furthermore, following the White Dew solar term, there was heavy rainfall, raising deep concerns about prolonged rain. Therefore, buying momentum increased. Hengyi, Zhenda, Gengfeng, Shenji, Yichang, and Fukang, all short sellers, uniformly resisted the advance, and forward months have already broken through the forty-dollar barrier. However, Yikang, Changfeng, Tongji, Mingde, Dachangcheng, and Meiji, all bulls, also unloaded a significant amount. As a result, all months rose by one dollar and twelve cents compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, trading opened with even heavier rainfall, and buying frenzy was unusually intense, but foreign merchants continued to sell, slightly stabilizing the market. Forced to retreat to Sanmu's prices, which caused a pullback. As a result, all months fell by twelve cents to thirty cents compared to the morning's closing price. Upon investigation, Changfeng sold 17,100 dan, Changhe 4,100 dan, Dachangcheng 4,300 dan, Yuanyi 4,900 dan, Mingde 6,100 dan, Tongji 3,400 dan, Meiji 2,300 dan, Shengyuan 2,000 dan, Yikang 15,100 dan, Yongchang 2,500 dan, Renfeng 3,200 dan, Taichang 1,700 zu, Juxing 2,000 dan, Tongfeng 2,000 dan, and Yicheng 2,500 dan. Shenji bought 15,700 dan, Yichang 7,200 dan, Fukang 5,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 3,000 dan, Tonghe 2,400 dan, Yongda 2,300 dan, Gengfeng 7,100 dan, Zhenda 3,400 dan, Xincheng 6,300 dan, Senkang 5,000 dan, Dachang 3,300 dan, Daji 5,000 dan, and Yukang 2,700 dan.</p>
<p>Fewer Spot Cotton Transactions</p>

<h3 id="e182">Short Sellers Rush to Cover, Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, Following Raw Cotton's Advance. All Months Break the Two Hundred Dollar Barrier. <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is strong, with a sharp upward trend. Overseas yarn prices are soaring, and yarn sales have been brisk for days. People's sentiment is inherently stable. With the help of this positive news, market prices are advancing rapidly. At the same time, raw cotton is rising, making the yarn market even more robust. All months have broken through the two hundred dollar barrier.</p>
<p>One Chicken Jump Exceeds Three Dollars</p>
<p>The forward yarn market opened, and due to the reduction in American cotton production, buying interest in the market was strong. Short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and all months rose in a straight line, breaking through the two hundred dollar barrier. Three-grade yarn also rose by more than three dollars. As a result, the market was filled with buying orders, and the situation was tense. Yuda, Jinchang, Mingde, Changfeng, Dachang, and Tonghe all sold off, while Hengyi, Zhenda, Shenji Xincheng, Yongda, and Fukang bought heavily. As a result, all months rose by an average of three dollars and two to four cents compared to the previous day's closing price. Market transactions were exceptionally lively, and trading closed at 1:00 PM. In the afternoon, trading was extended to 3:00 PM, and the momentum remained strong. Because retail investors concentrated on covering short positions, all months rose by eight to nine cents to one dollar. Subsequently, profit-takers liquidated their positions, leading to a loosening and pullback. As a result, all months rose again by two, four, and five cents compared to the morning's closing price, while forward months fell by one, three cents. Upon investigation, Gengfeng sold 3,050 bales, Tonghe 3,000 bales, Dachang 2,400 bales, Changfeng 5,350 bales, Yuanyi 2,000 bales, Senkang 1,100 bales, Mingde 1,450 bales, Jinchang 3,500 bales, Yuda 2,750 bales, Tongji 1,600 bales, Meiji 1,500 bales, and Dafeng 1,100 bales.

<p>Yarn Sales Still Exceed 2,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still considered decent. According to statistics, various guilds bought a total of 2,265 bales throughout the day, with the selling price increasing by two dollars. The purchase volume of each guild is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e183">Estimated Quantity Sharply Reduced, American Cotton Surges by Over Sixty Points per Pound <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with all months up four to nine points per pound. The market situation was unstable in the early morning. Although prices were high, hedging sales increased. After the government estimate was released, the quantity was sharply reduced, and the public actively bought, causing prices to jump. Foreign merchants, Wall Street, and industry players all engaged in buying, and sentiment leaned towards long positions. Before the close, hedging sales and profit-taking caused some pullback, but demand remained good, and the close was firm. Spot prices rose by 63 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 51 to 63 points per pound. British spot cotton fell by seven points, and futures rose by 27 to 31 points.

<h3 id="e186">Cotton Fabric Transactions are Increasingly Brisk. Japanese Merchants Open Over Three Hundred Pieces of Fine Twill for this Month. Guangdong and Guangxi Search for Local Factory's Fine Cloth and Fine Twill Very Eagerly. <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth was stimulated by the soaring domestic and foreign yarn and cotton prices. The market prices of all goods rose sharply, and industry sentiment was excellent. East goods fine cloth and fine twill rose by about one jiao per piece. Only ten-pound Dancing Cloth, 84 Flying Fish Dancing original cloth, sold at the original price due to weak demand. Japanese merchants still opened over three hundred pieces of fine twill for this month. Local factory goods fine cloth and fine twill, because Guangdong and Guangxi searched, all factories almost exhausted the current and future piece quantities, and the market price rose the most sharply, adding one jiao per piece. Fine cloth, coarse cloth, Tianjin, Guangdong, and Hankou guilds all purchased various brands, and the market price rose slightly. Yesterday, the Tianjin guild continued to purchase over four hundred pieces of sixteen-pound eleven-pound coarse cloth and twelve-pound coarse twill, and the market price has slightly increased by five fen per piece. Domestic and foreign factory serge and straight tribute merchants gradually increased prices. Four Gentlemen serge has now risen to two jiao and six fen per yard, straight tribute two jiao and seven fen, and Xuxian Village straight tribute satin two jiao and six fen, also because yarn and thread are soaring and products are lacking. After the Tianjin and Guangdong guilds poured in, Sichuan, the Yangtze River, Shandong, and local streets also competed to purchase, causing white goods and patterned goods to be in short supply and prices firm, and transactions were very brisk. Yihua Factory coarse cloth and coarse twill also sold over five hundred bags, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Main Reasons for Expensive Flour (1) Foreign Wheat Continues to Rise (2) Cotton Yarn Soars. Floating Short Positions Compete to Cover, Suddenly Rising Five Fen and Seventy-Five Points. <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months suddenly showed a uniform increase because foreign wheat prices in Chicago increased by about one jiao, and Canada increased by four to five jiao. When prices opened, it was raining heavily, and because cotton yarn was soaring, and foreign wheat prices seemed to have been rising for three or four days, various factors made people's sentiment active. The current month had previously risen sharply, reaching a maximum of three yuan and one jiao, and forward months also rose by two or three fen. Afterwards, in each round, the current month fell by nearly fen due to long position liquidation, and forward months also largely fluctuated. Until additional long positions were pulled in from outside the industry, and retail short positions also competed to cover positions rapidly, the market then rose by two or three fen. This upward trend was partly driven by cotton yarn and partly due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat and floating short positions competing to cover, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Wheat Market is also Encouraged by Sentiment. All Months Rise by Four, Five, and Six Fen. <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, when it opened in the morning, all months showed increases because foreign wheat prices continued to rise by one jiao to four or five jiao. Market sentiment, due to seeing rain after the White Dew solar term, inevitably had more concerns, and foreign markets also changed. Therefore, buyers were enthusiastic, and prices were immediately raised by three to five fen. Afterwards, because the flour market was good, prices were raised another one or two fen. When trading opened in the afternoon, transactions were still smooth, but the market turned flat, falling back one or two fen compared to the morning. This upward trend was really encouraged by sentiment. It was not like the improvement in flour sales, which seemed to have a solid foundation. The spot wheat market, because the standard rebounded, all grades increased by two or three fen. Shandong wheat opened at four yuan, nine jiao, two fen; second grade at four yuan, nine jiao; Guzhen wheat at four yuan, nine jiao; second grade at four yuan, eight jiao, eight fen; Yaowan wheat at four yuan, eight jiao, seven fen, and Jue eight jiao; Huai'an wheat at four yuan, seven jiao, three fen, and Jue six jiao and a half; Gaoyou wheat at four yuan, seven jiao and a half, and Jue seven jiao and three fen; Jiangbei wheat at four yuan, seven jiao, three or four fen; Bengbu wheat at four yuan, eight jiao, three fen, and Jue eight jiao; Wuhu wheat at four yuan, seven jiao, and Jue six jiao; Zhuzhen wheat at four yuan, seven jiao, eight fen, and Jue seven jiao and a half; Bao'ying wheat at four yuan, seven jiao, three fen; Hankou wheat at four yuan, five jiao and a half; Hunan wheat at four yuan, five jiao, seven fen; and Nanjing wheat at four yuan, seven jiao.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw more selling pressure in the market, especially for Number Four, and market prices weakened slightly. Huai transactions still showed no improvement, and the trend remained range-bound. The number of accounts was too small, new transactions did not start, and speculators disappeared. Therefore, even with external stimuli, market prices still did not fluctuate. The future is not easy to have significant fluctuations. Yesterday, at the opening, there was more selling of Number Four, falling about one or two jiao. In the next round, the situation was chaotic, with ups and downs mixed. There were slight inter-period transactions, and several types showed no rise or fall. When trading opened in the afternoon, although it was still fluctuating and oscillating between five fen and one jiao, there were more gains than losses. The closing was unusually quiet, with either no one asking or no rise or fall, or still ups and downs between five fen and one jiao. This repeated dullness was annoying, and the future was not easy to unfold. As a result, market prices fell slightly, about one jiao to two jiao. The total transaction volume was 3,195,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market saw mixed ups and downs. Price negotiations with New York silk merchants largely showed declines, but market prices opened and both near and far months slightly rebounded. However, transactions were quite bleak. Yesterday, the total city transaction was only 410 bales. The price of silk rose and fell. Japanese silk 83 was down 4 points, 75 grade was down 5 points, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk were each down 3 points. Standard spot silk rose 1 point, and futures rose 2 points. Lyon Japanese silk fell 1.25 francs, and Chinese silk held its original price. Yokohama spot rose 2 yuan, and futures rose 8 yuan. In the Shanghai silk market, user purchases were still strong. White factory Shichuan Lu Huang Bai Jing were all active, and market prices gradually stabilized. Regarding foreign factories, Dafeng, Dachang and other firms also had considerable intake yesterday, and foreign market prices also showed a rebound trend.

<h3 id="e194">Chong'er's Perseverance and Determination <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Su Xi</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn period in our country, there was a prince of the State of Jin named Chong'er. From a young age, he had great ambitions and a fervent patriotic heart. Although he experienced various hardships and unbearable humiliations, in the end, he was able to respect the emperor and achieve hegemonic success, firstly because he had the help of wise and capable talents, and secondly because he himself had profound thoughts and a resolute will. There are many twists and turns in this story. Let's slowly tell it.</p>
<p>Initially, Chong'er's father, Duke Xian of Jin, was seduced by his favorite concubine and scared their three brothers away. Later, after Duke Xian died, the people of Jin welcomed Chong'er's younger brother, Yiwu, back and made him the ruler of Jin. This was called Duke Hui.</p>
<p>Chong'er was naturally Duke Hui's elder brother. When he was young, he wanted to be the leader of the hegemons. He often said to himself:</p>
<p>"When I grow up, I will definitely become a leader and make the lords of all directions obey my orders."</p>
<p>Not only did he have this great ambition, but he also had extremely intelligent and capable people to help him. Fox Yan, Jiu Fan, Zhao Cui, Xian Zhen, and Jia Tuo were all his right-hand men.</p>
<p>Cherishing great ambitions in his heart, he left his country and first fled to Pu City. His father, Duke Xian, secretly sent people to Pu City, wanting to kill him and the virtuous men who were helping him to eliminate future troubles. They received this news and fled together to the Di state.</p>
<p>When Chong'er arrived in the Di state, it so happened that the Di state had a very virtuous woman. The Di ruler married her to Chong'er. Although the couple lived a very happy life, his ambition to be a leader was still not forgotten. He often said to her:</p>
<p>"I not only want to be the ruler of Jin, but I also want to be the leader of the hegemons, so that the lords of all directions will listen to me. How happy would that be!"</p>
<p>After hearing these words, she encouraged him, saying:</p>
<p>"A true man should be like that!"</p>
<p>Chong'er fled to the Di state, but it was only to recuperate. Now that he had recuperated enough, and fearing that Duke Hui would send people to harm him, he decided to travel to various powerful states to broaden his knowledge and then find a way to return to his country. He said to Zhao Cui:</p>
<p>"Duke Huan of Qi is a very virtuous man. Let's go to his place."</p>
<p>When they were about to leave, the couple could not bear to part. Chong'er said to his wife:</p>
<p>"I want to be the leader of the hegemons within twenty-five years. If I can't do it, you should marry someone else."</p>
<p>His wife said:</p>
<p>"After twenty-five years, my hair will also be white. How can I still get married? I am determined to wait for you. Please concentrate on creating a great career and wish you success soon!"</p>
<p>Chong'er left the Di state and passed through the State of Wei. Duke Wen treated him very coldly. Along the way, when he passed Wu Lu, he was so hungry that his legs were weak and he could not move. He asked a peasant for food. The peasant also looked down on him and threw the food on a clay vessel. Chong'er was very angry at such humiliation and wanted to kill the rude peasant immediately. Zhao Cui persuaded him from the side:</p>
<p>"This is a sign of your future success. The clay vessel represents that you will definitely have a large territory in the future. Why are you angry?"</p>
<p>Chong'er listened to his words and was no longer angry. He accepted the food, thanked the peasant, and slowly went to the State of Qi. When he arrived in the State of Qi, Duke Huan treated him very well and married his clan daughter to Chong'er. Later, he lived in the State of Qi for more than two years, enjoying a very happy life. He even gradually forgot about his desire to return to his country and to become a hegemon.</p>
<p>Zhao Cui and others knew that if this continued for a long time, Chong'er's great ambition and great career would definitely disappear without a trace. They often discussed ways to get him to leave the State of Qi. One day, their conversation was overheard by the Qi woman, who advised her husband, Chong'er:</p>
<p>"You are the prince of Jin and bear a heavy responsibility. You should find a way to return to Jin. A man's ambition should be high. You must not let your lofty ambition disappear just for a woman. Moreover, there are these intelligent and hardworking virtuous men who are following you. How can you ignore them and be worthy of them?"</p>
<p>The Qi woman persuaded him earnestly several times, but Chong'er still did not listen. The Qi woman had no choice but to discuss with Zhao Cui and others. They first got him drunk with wine and then put him on a carriage and set off. Zhao Cui secretly thought that such a woman (referring to the Qi woman) did not do selfish things and could persuade Chong'er, clearly understanding the righteous path. It was truly admirable. He could not help but thank the Qi woman.</p>
<p>A few days later, Chong'er had already boarded the carriage in a drunken state and was sent out of the State of Qi by others. Not far away, he woke up, feeling very unwilling, and wanted to punish Jiu Fan. Jiu Fan knew what he meant and advised:</p>
<p>"My wish is to see you succeed in great things. Kill me, blame me, I am not afraid."</p>
<p>Chong'er's anger did not subside, and he said hatefully:</p>
<p>"If I fail to achieve success in the future, I will definitely eat your flesh."</p>
<p>Jiu Fan listened and replied very bravely and loyally:</p>
<p>"If you unfortunately fail in the future, then I will definitely be at the end of my wits and strength and will have died long ago, and my flesh will have rotted. How can you still eat it?"</p>
<p>When Chong'er heard these words, he suddenly woke up and felt very ashamed. He silently continued on his way. They first went to the State of Cao, where Duke Gong treated him very coldly. Then they went to the State of Song, where Duke Xiang welcomed him warmly. Chong'er saw that the State of Song had a strong army and wanted to borrow this army to return to his country. Later, he listened to Jiu Fan's advice and gave up the idea. Moving forward again, they went to the State of Zheng, where Duke Wen also treated him coldly. Zheng Shuzhan had already determined that Chong'er was a very talented and ambitious person. Fearing that he would cause trouble for the State of Zheng in the future, he advised Duke Wen to kill him at this time. Fortunately, Duke Wen did not listen to his words. However, Chong'er was already in extreme danger. Later, they fled to the State of Chu, where King Cheng treated him very well. One day, when they were having a banquet, they drank too much wine. The King of Chu said to Chong'er:</p>
<p>"If you can become the ruler of Jin in the future, how will you repay me?"</p>
<p>Chong'er stroked the hilt of his sword and smiled:</p>
<p>"There are many precious things. I will definitely not take them again. Perhaps when we fight in the future, I will definitely let you have ninety li of land."</p>
<p>At that time, the Chu general, Ziyu, was very angry and asked the King of Chu to kill him. The King of Chu knew very well that Chong'er was a talented person and that he had many wise people to help him. Such a person who could endure hardship and had perseverance could not be killed. Therefore, he did not kill him. But Chong'er went through another great crisis.</p>
<p>Later, when he went to the State of Qin, it so happened that Duke Hui of Jin died, and the State of Jin sent people to the State of Qin to welcome him. The State of Qin also sent people to escort him back to his country to become the ruler of Jin. This was called Duke Wen of Jin. At that time, he was already an old man with gray hair. But he was unwilling to be discouraged because of his old age and still wanted to pursue his hegemonic career.</p>
<p>In the fourth year of Duke Wen, the lords of various states joined forces with the State of Chu to bully the State of Song. Song asked Jin for help. Chong'er felt that the State of Chu had treated him well before, so he was now embarrassed to make things difficult for them. However, Song was a small country, and these weak nations had to be helped. So he was in a dilemma. Later, he listened to Fox Yan's words and learned that the State of Chu had just defeated the State of Cao and had close ties with the State of Wei. He used a strategy to attack Cao and Wei first. As expected, the State of Chu moved its troops to save Cao and Wei, and the siege of the State of Song was lifted. Later, the State of Chu attacked Song again, and Song again asked Jin for help. Chong'er was forced to fight the Chu army. At the beginning of the battle, he ordered his soldiers to retreat ninety li first, which was to fulfill the promise he had made to the King of Chu when he was in the State of Chu. As a result, the Chu army was defeated. Chong'er presented the many Chu soldiers he had captured to the Zhou Emperor and said respectfully:</p>
<p>"The State of Chu cannot respect the emperor's will and disrupts the lords of various states, relying on the power of a strong country to bully the small nations. We relied on justice to defeat them. Now, we are willing to offer these prisoners to Your Majesty to show that we will always respect the emperor's will."</p>
<p>The Zhou Emperor was very happy when he heard Chong'er's words and rewarded him heavily. He respectfully bowed several times before daring to accept the rewards. From then on, Chong'er became the hegemon.</p>
<p>He experienced all kinds of hardships and humiliations in his life, but he was able to adhere to his principles, so he finally achieved his ambition of becoming a hegemon. In this way, Chong'er can be said to deserve the four words "perseverance and determination" without any shame.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Playwright George Bernard Shaw <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xishi</p>
<p>In February of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), George Bernard Shaw came to China, staying in Shanghai for only one day before going to Beiping (Beijing). His purpose in going to Beiping was to admire China's ancient relics and scenic spots. At that time, many Chinese writers and politicians went to inquire about Shaw's opinions on the Chinese people. Readers will surely remember that the situation in Beiping and Tianjin was as serious as it is now. However, Rehe was still under the jurisdiction of the central government. This nearly eighty-year-old, unusually healthy Shaw expressed the following opinion: "China is currently in a critical period of survival. I dare not offer any advice, but I only hope that the Chinese people can save themselves from this situation. Because if the Chinese people can truly unite and work together, I believe that no one in the world can resist them."</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1856. His father was an elderly, retired minor official who was fond of drinking. This elderly drunkard, recognizing the bleak future and the heavy responsibility, took all of his future pension to start a bread business. However, the result was completely contrary to expectations. Not only did it fail to improve his living situation, but it also left him penniless. Shortly after this failure, he passed away from excessive grief and depression.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Shaw's mother was not as easily discouraged by setbacks as her husband was. She set her sights and struggled forward. Because she had a special interest in music, shortly after her husband's death, through diligent effort, she actually gained a considerable position in the Dublin music scene, relying on her daily income to support her orphaned children and herself. Shaw was fortunate to have such a talented mother, even in such circumstances. Later, she gained the highest support in the literary world, and we cannot ignore her mother's contributions.</p>
<p>When Shaw was studying in elementary school, he was a child who refused to be subdued by his environment. He studied very hard, but he opposed mindless rote learning. He saw many classmates holding textbooks all day long, tirelessly memorizing, reading wherever the teacher told them to, without considering whether they thoroughly understood the meaning of the text. Shaw was most opposed to this way of studying. In history class, when the teacher wanted him to memorize many historical dates and unimportant names and places, he resolutely refused. He felt that such studying not only did not help his knowledge, but also needlessly damaged his brain, which was too meaningless. He did not pay much attention to textbooks. If it was a subject that suited his temperament, he would put in extra effort, not releasing the book until he truly understood it. At the age of fifty-four, he graduated from a commercial school and then became a clerk at the Dublin Land Company. That year, two American missionaries came to Dublin to preach. Shaw, upon hearing this news, had his rebellious spirit aroused. He took a public letter and published it in the local newspaper. The main idea of this letter was to oppose superstition and to explain that there was no such thing as "God" in the world. When people with outdated ideas in the area saw this letter, they were very shocked and angry, saying that Shaw was a religious rebel.</p>
<p>When Shaw was twenty years old, his mother decided to go to London to make a living, and he had no choice but to follow her. Their move was indeed too dangerous because they did not know anyone in the vast city of London, and they had little money. However, this virtuous and promising mother was not afraid of these difficulties and fought hard in this society. Before long, she found a job that allowed her to support herself. At that time, Shaw worked hard reading literary books all day long. Undoubtedly, his lifelong determination to dedicate himself to literature was decided at that time. In the first three years in London, he worked as a bookkeeper in a store, but whenever he had the opportunity, he worked hard on literature. In his free time, he went to the library to read books or participated in various social activities because he had a very clear understanding of society. If you want to be a writer, but you are ignorant of the situation in society, then you will never write great works.</p>
<p>Although Shaw wrote many novels and submitted them to various places, they were all met with the cold eyes of the editors and were thrown into the wastepaper basket. However, he was not discouraged at all, but put more effort into literature.</p>
<p>When he recalled the situation of his manuscripts being rejected by the editors, he said, "Life is like war. If you cannot muster the courage to persevere to the end when you are fighting, then you will be defeated by it. If I had relaxed my hopes and determination because of temporary failures, then I would never have the position I have in the literary world today."</p>
<p>When he was twenty-six, the American socialist Henry George came to London to give lectures. Shaw, who was accustomed to participating in social activities, also attended. After listening to Henry's lecture, he was greatly moved. Two years later, he united several close friends who shared his ideas and organized a group to save and transform society. The members of this group were all famous scholars at the time. They witnessed the injustices of the world, so they wanted to transform society. Their idea was to gradually get mutually hostile people to find ways to connect and cooperate. Shaw did a lot of valuable things in this group, so he was not only a writer but also a social reformer. At that time, he did a lot of criticism. However, before the age of thirty-seven, he was still an ordinary person, and he still had no status in society as before. But in that same year he published a play, "Mrs. Warren's Profession", which caused a sensation in the entire European literary world. The major theaters in England competed to rehearse it. When it was staged, it was truly a sea of people, extremely crowded, and it received applause and cheers from the audience. From then on, George Bernard Shaw's fame in the literary world was established. After that, he wrote many plays, all of which were very famous. In 1926, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Since then, the world has recognized him as a great playwright. Yes, nothing is ever done in vain. If you put in effort, you will always have success. It was only because Shaw endured hardship and hardship that he has achieved today's success. This was not a lucky win but a well-deserved reward.</p>
<p>To Contributing Writers: I would like to wake you up, please consider your readers and the mission of this publication. This publication does not intend to cater to intellectuals or literary figures who are already well-educated, so the writing must be popular and clear. If you have a fresh and unique style, it is better to submit it elsewhere. In terms of style, we want stories, not news reports, and not missionary arguments. The topic should be new and interesting, but it should be written in a way that is understandable to the general public. Here is a method you might try: read the completed article aloud to illiterate people in your family and see if they can understand it and are interested. If the author has seen too many new things, he may wish to go back and look at texts such as "Stories Old and New" and "The Travels of Lao Ts'an". ——Editor</p>

<h3 id="e196">Jane Eyre: An Autobiography (Part 4) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Written by English C. Brontë, translated by Li Jiyie, published by the World Literature Series of the Life Bookstore</p>
<p>As a result, Rochester committed bigamy and deceived the innocent and pure young girl, Jane Eyre. The circumstances forced Rochester to announce the truth: the madwoman living in the attic of Thornfield Hall was his legal wife. He had been deceived and involuntarily married Bertha Antoinetta Mason, who had not yet developed her madness. The person who had repeatedly tried to kill Rochester and had bitten her brother, Richard Mason, was none other than Rochester's legal wife, Mason. These were the great secrets of Thornfield Hall, all of which Jane Eyre had inexplicably experienced firsthand. A group of people, including Briggs, made a special trip to visit the beast-like madwoman, who fought with Rochester on the spot.</p>
<p>Bertha Antoinetta Mason's madness was hereditary. She also had a brother who was completely mute and an idiot. However, her father was a planter and wealthy merchant in the West Indies. Rochester's father and brother, in order to obtain the wealthy merchant's daughter's dowry of 30,000 pounds, facilitated this unfortunate marriage. At first, she was not crazy, but she became crazy after marrying Rochester. After going crazy, she was confined to the third floor of Thornfield for ten years. For a great price, a maid, Grace Poole, was hired to watch over her, and a doctor, Carter, was specially contracted to prevent temporary accidents.</p>
<p>Since this secret was revealed, Jane Eyre could not bear such a great shock and could not bear to see someone already having a wife while she willingly became someone's mistress, so she left.</p>
<p>Alone, she sleepily stole away from Thornfield Hall. It was just before dawn when she boarded a bus going to an unknown destination, paid the driver the only twenty shillings she had on her, and was taken to a very, very far intersection called Whitcross, where she got off the bus. She also lost the small package of clothes she had brought with her. Disoriented, she stumbled into a small town, wanting to find a small job, even wanting to find a servant's position, but she was rejected everywhere. Helpless, she could only beg and sleep in the open.</p>
<p>One rainy night, she approached a house in a village called Morton. She saw two young girls reading inside through the window. She knocked on the door to beg, but was rejected by an old woman. In the face of hunger and cold, she fainted at the door. When the male owner of the house returned from outside, he discovered this dying beggar girl. He called the women inside the house to rescue her. Fortunately, because of the soup feeding, she woke up, and the young girls gave her their warm bed. After resting for a few days, she was completely well.</p>
<p>The owner of the house was named St. John Rivers, and he was a pastor. He had two sisters, one named Mary and one named Diana, and an old maid named Hannah. They questioned her about her background. She kept her secret, changed her name to Jane Elliott, and only told them the history of Lowood School, hiding the events at Thornfield.</p>
<p>She lived with St. John's family in Morton for some time, and they got along very well with each other. She asked St. John to introduce her to a job so that she could live independently, even if it was as a seamstress, a nurse, or a servant. Later, St. John introduced her to be the headmistress of a cottage school in his parish, which she naturally took on with great pleasure. The funding for the school was provided by Mr. Oliver, the owner of the valley's needle factory and foundry. His only daughter, Miss Oliver, had also taught at the school, but now she did not have time, so she hired Jane Eyre. St. John and Miss Oliver already had considerable affection for each other, but St. John, who was dedicated to the church, did not think that the wealthy Miss Oliver was his ideal match.</p>
<p>St. John was going to accompany Hannah to do pastoral work. Diana and Mary were working as nannies in fashionable cities in southern England. Because of poverty, everyone had to go their separate ways, so the house in Morton had to be locked up. Although they all felt reluctant and had many sad expressions.</p>
<p>At the cottage school, she met Miss Oliver and became good friends. She did a sketch of Miss Oliver's beautiful face. This artistic talent surprised Miss Oliver. Soon, St. John also saw it when he came to the school.</p>
<p>Miss Oliver was very beautiful, and St. John was also very handsome. They were a match made in heaven, but unfortunately, because of the relationship between rich and poor classes, there was an invisible obstacle. Furthermore, St. John wanted to realize his sacred ideal career and go to India to preach. He felt that only Jane Eyre, who had insight, perseverance, and a sharp mind, was his only qualified assistant.</p>
<p>One night, late at night, St. John came. He revealed to Jane all of her past history (because he had received a letter from the lawyer Briggs) and told her that she was now a wealthy woman with a inheritance of 20,000 pounds. This inheritance was designated to her by her uncle, Mr. Eyre, in his dying will. Jane, in her surprise and joy, immediately suggested dividing the 20,000 pounds, with St. John, Diana, Mary, and herself each getting one-quarter—5,000 pounds.</p>
<p>As for why the lawyer Briggs wrote to St. John about the relationship with Jane's mother? It turned out that St. John's mother's surname was Eyre. She was Jane's father's sister. The big wine merchant, Mr. Eyre, was Jane's uncle, and also St. John's uncle. Eyre and St. John, Diana, and Mary were cousins. Everyone did not know each other, but met unintentionally.</p>
<p>The lawyer Briggs was Mr. Eyre's lawyer. He wrote to St. John saying that his uncle, Mr. Eyre, had died and left his property to his brother's orphaned daughter. A few weeks later, he wrote again, saying that the heiress was missing and asked St. John if he knew any news about her. He unintentionally discovered Jane's real name from a painting and a piece of paper. He then realized that "Elliott" was an assumed name.</p>
<p>After all of this truth was understood, the vacation season was approaching. She returned to Morton in advance, cleaned up and tidied up the old house, arranging it very properly, waiting for Diana and Mary to return, so everyone could enjoy this vacation. During the holidays, their happiness naturally increased a hundredfold compared to before because they were no longer paupers without anything.</p>

<h3 id="e197">History of Gonorrhea Treatment <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>The latest treatment was invented after research by many scholars and under government incentives</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of treatment for gonorrhea, countless scholars throughout history have researched and exhausted their efforts, and truly effective treatments have achieved real success. This is the application of the most valuable "Reiztherapie" (stimulation therapy) in treating gonorrhea today, and it is also why the oral preparation "Clinon" of this treatment is widely adopted.</p>
<p>Before the invention of stimulation therapy, many scholars were racking their brains, burying themselves in books and laboratories. In the wards, there was initially the so-called transmembranous sterilization therapy for gonorrhea, which used drugs to clear the urethra and gradually reduce the gonorrhea bacteria on the urethral mucosa. This was very popular for a time. However, because gonorrhea is not only hidden in the urethral mucosa, but also throughout the body and blood, as can be seen from the bacteria in gonorrheal arthritis, local transmembranous sterilization ultimately failed. After disappointment, scholars encouraged each other with the saying "failure is the mother of success" and conducted more meticulous research. In addition, various governments established specialized research institutions and provided generous incentives, which ultimately led to the invention of "Reiztherapie" by Professors Buchner and Romer, which was praised by scholars from various countries. However, this therapy was only a theory and had not yet been put into practical use. Therefore, Dr. Biedel of Germany, based on his theory, created the oral gonorrhea drug "Clinon" by matching protein with purified pigment. From then on, the world's authoritative scholars competed in its research. They unanimously adopted it, opening a new era in gonorrhea treatment, and a huge wave arose in the medical community! After repeated clinical trials by renowned scholars such as Bertin, Ronnefeld, and Mirakjane, it was confirmed that it was non-toxic and had a kingly nature. I used it during my internship in Russia to treat all kinds of acute and chronic male and female leucorrhea, which was extremely effective. About five to six bottles to eight or nine bottles are needed to completely cure it and prevent recurrence. For women's gonorrheal leucorrhea, in addition to taking "Clinon," "Carle Sedi" is also used as a vaginal suppository. And for male prostatitis, orchitis, and gonorrheal complications such as arthritis, taking "Clinon" has special effects.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Tuberculosis and Other Diseases <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Deng Yuanhe, Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University</p>
<p>Clinic: At the intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road. Consulting Hours: 4 PM to 6 PM</p>
<p>Tuberculosis patients are the most common disease in the city, and the number of people who die from this disease every year is unknown. In the past, when I treated this disease, the number of cases with good outcomes was only about three or four out of ten, and the rest were mostly incurable. Since the adoption of calcium preparations, gradually good results have been achieved. However, at least dozens of injections are required, and patients often tire of the trouble. Since Dr. Tu Mei's oral preparation "Pulmonal" came into the world, I have used it to test many tuberculosis patients and have achieved real results. Moreover, the drug is pure and benign, with no drawbacks. Now, I will describe the cases below.</p>
<p>Case 1: Tuberculosis. Patient Mr. Shen Mengfei, 26 years old, academic circles.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Coughing with some phlegm. After treatment, the phlegm decreased slightly. After about two months, he experienced violent coughing again. He had a slight fever in the evening, and his appetite was impaired. Chest pain, night sweats. Insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus, heart palpitations, frequent seminal emission, back pain. Weight loss.</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment: He was diagnosed with apical tuberculosis. Percussion and auscultation revealed a cavity sound. He was given "Pulmonal" to kill bacteria and remove fatigue, and he was also instructed to take "Nutritonal" to save weakness (women can take "Woman's Nutritonal" to regulate menstruation and strengthen the body). At the same time, he also took "Nervine Pills for Seminal Emission" to treat seminal emission. After taking two bottles of each, the hemoptysis stopped immediately, and the symptoms of weakness disappeared. After taking several more bottles, his weight increased, his spirits were cheerful, and his complexion was rosy and gratifying, he said.</p>
<p>Case 2: Asthma. Patient Mr. Du Yingling, 47 years old, business circles.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Usually has a lot of phlegm, which is white and foamy. Asthma attacks occur in spring and winter, with difficult breathing and a pale complexion. Cannot lie flat. Recently, the old illness suddenly recurred, with shortness of breath, palpitations, reduced food intake, tidal surge of phlegm, dizziness, and blurred vision.</p>
<p>Diagnosis and Treatment: He was diagnosed with cardiac asthma. It is appropriate to take "Pulmonal" to calm the heart and relieve asthma, relax bronchial spasms, and resolve phlegm, which is very effective. Therefore, this drug was taken together with "Nutritonal" to suppress his lungs and invigorate his physical strength. After a month of treatment, he was completely cured, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Cause and Treatment of Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>Daydreaming, frequent erotic dreams.</p>
<p>Seminal emission is the most troubling for those who suffer from unrequited love.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission refers to nocturnal seminal emission. There are many reasons for this, either due to masturbation or excessive intercourse, resulting in stimulation-induced weakness of the nervous system, leading to neurasthenia of the reproductive organs. Masturbation and excessive intercourse constantly excite the nervous system's response, thus generating excitation and stimulus to the ejaculation centre, resulting in nocturnal emission. Hence, obscene talk, writings, and paintings often lead to nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from seminal emission are mostly those who suffer from unrequited love, as their daydreaming easily stimulates the nerves. Others with congenital deficiencies and those with neurasthenia also suffer from this condition. There are also those who have seminal emission without dreams, which is because the vas deferens is relaxed, resulting in semen leakage during urination and bowel movements, as well as during exertion. Even more severe cases include impotence, weak erections, mental confusion, forgetfulness, insomnia, and thinness.</p>
<p>In terms of treatment, seminal emission is naturally treated mainly with "Nervine Pills". Because "Nervine Pills" have the effect of strengthening the vas deferens and sedating the nerves. It can also reduce stimulation, so masturbation is stopped after taking it. This medicine can fundamentally cure nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and seminal leakage. At the same time, it is best to take "Nutritonal" to restore weakness and increase function. Full effect can be achieved in about two to four weeks!</p>

<p>The Pain of Untreated Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is certainly very painful during the acute period, but if it can be cured quickly and thoroughly during this painful period, then the duration of this pain is very short. However, once the opportunity to cure the acute phase is lost, this gonorrhea is easily transmitted to the opposite sex. In the past, the pain only affected one person, but now two people are harmed. Therefore, its danger is more significant than in the acute phase.</p>
<p>If, unfortunately, both men and women are troubled by gonorrhea, they must urgently seek appropriate treatment. Mr. Li Tianba, who lives on Xiaoshadu Road, is 25 years old. He had gonorrhea before, and although he continued to seek treatment, it was not effective. His testicles were swollen and hardened, and urination was difficult. There were pus and blood cells in the gonorrheal system, ejaculation was difficult, and the perineum and anus were pulled and ached. Later, after purchasing and reading my "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from the Great Eastern Bookstore, he learned that orchitis poses a risk of infertility. He immediately came to me for treatment. I used X-ray and electrical therapy for him and also gave him "Clinon" to kill bacteria, eliminate inflammation, and clear residual toxins in the blood, so that the testicles would regain their original reproductive power. After taking it for four weeks, the swelling of the testicles subsided, and the urine was clear. However, after microscopic examination, there were still a few pus cells in the gonorrheal system. He continued to take "Clinon" for more than ten days, and the pus and blood in the gonorrheal system disappeared. After repeated serum tests six or seven times, no gonorrhea was found, which proved the radical cure. Mr. Li was overjoyed. He told me that his wife's gonorrheal leucorrhea was very severe, and the local area was irritated by pus toxins, so it was eroded and painful, and even prevented urination. He asked me to recommend a good medicine, so I told her to take "Clinon" internally and use "Carle Sedi Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository for both internal and external treatment. The gonorrheal discharge was cleared, and she was completely cured in four weeks. The couple were very happy and thanked me before leaving. However, if Mr. Li's illness could have been cured in time, he would not have suffered so much pain.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Loss of Reproductive Power and Intelligence <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Imperial University of Japan Medical School</p>
<p>Most Appropriate Cures, Overly Reliant on Iron Instruments</p>
<p>The loss of reproductive power is often due to excessive masturbation during adolescence, which halts the development and function of the reproductive glands. The reproductive gland system is also closely related to brainpower, so a decrease in reproductive power inevitably leads to a decrease in intelligence. Therefore, patients with incomplete development, nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, and impotence often suffer from weakened memory, sluggish thinking, and errors in judgment. This is evidence of reproductive dysfunction.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this condition, hormone preparations are most effective. However, various companies differ in their raw materials and manufacturing methods, and there are a great many types of hormones. It is common for a country to have dozens of endocrine preparations, but satisfactory results are rarely seen. However, the male "Prostakern" and female "Gynaekon" drugs invented by Mellen in Germany are the most effective. When I was at the Imperial University of Japan Medical School, a magazine in Berlin detailed the efficacy of these drugs and animal experiments, which confirmed the accuracy and completeness of "Prostakern" effects, surpassing any other endocrine preparation. After returning to China, clinical experiments also confirmed the correctness of "Prostakern's" effect, making it a widely adopted choice by major physicians worldwide. Therefore, it is no coincidence that these two drugs - "Prostakern" and "Gynaekon" - have long been popular worldwide. The inventors of these two drugs conducted animal experiments for many years, resulting in unexpected results, which led to continuous refinement and research, taking more than thirty years to complete. It has a positive corrective effect on those who have experienced a sharp decline in reproductive power and intelligence due to masturbation.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Annoying Persistent Leukorrhea in Women! <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>Leukorrhea in women is often persistent, gradually eroding the vagina and vulva, causing inflammation, redness, swelling, and ulceration, thus hindering urination and causing pain during intercourse. Even more worrisome is that it can lead to menstrual difficulties and lower abdominal distension. There are many sources of leukorrhea in women, including insufficient congenital ovarian development and physical weakness, mechanical stimulation such as rough intercourse and masturbation leading to mucosal damage, and infection by gonorrhea. In short, although there are many causes of leukorrhea in women, they generally fall into the three major principles listed above.</p>
<p>Therefore, the principles of treatment are to prevent spoilage and sterilize, correct congenital maldevelopment, and strengthen the body. According to our years of clinical experience, women with leukorrhea can generally insert German "Karlsruhe vaginal suppositories" into the vagina, washing them away the next morning. For those with insufficient ovarian development or physical weakness, "Gynaekon" can also be taken. For those infected with gonorrhea, "Cleranon" can also be taken. Treating both the surface and the root will produce faster results. "Karlsruhe vaginal suppositories" have antiseptic, bactericidal, and analgesic effects, but do not have the irritating properties of general suppositories. Therefore, every woman can apply it at home for self-treatment without any drawbacks.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Home Treatment of Stomach Problems <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Belching and acid reflux, growth seen in food. Frowning, the reason being constipation. Today, the world is renowned, and the human brain is used more vigorously. As a result of thinking, the function of the stomach often declines, so stomach disease has become one of the civilized diseases. The initial stage of stomach disease is decreased appetite, chest and diaphragm fullness, and abdominal distension and pain. This is often seen after catching a cold and not controlling one's diet. If not treated urgently, it will turn into a chronic condition, leading to belching, acid reflux, vomiting, and noise. According to my clinical experience, strengthening the stomach is the main treatment. Therefore, a large dose of "Strong Stomach Essence" should be taken to invigorate stomach function and promote appetite, then the appetite will be restored, and various stomach problems will be cured, dispelling the clouds and seeing the blue sky, and achieving lasting health.</p>
<p>The first step of the impact of stomach disease is the disturbance of intestinal function, resulting in symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, and excessive farting. "Strong Stomach Essence" contains enzymes that have the special effect of reducing fermentation and stimulating intestinal function. Therefore, abnormal bowel movements and excessive farting can be completely cured by taking "Strong Stomach Essence".</p>
<p>For those who sleep late in the morning, have bad breath, eat little, and are thin, taking "Strong Stomach Essence" can transform their digestive function, resulting in good nutrition, and bad breath and excessive saliva will be eliminated. It is best to take it simultaneously with "Prostakern" for men or "Gynaekon" for women to boost physical strength, which will be more effective and result in a strong body and vigorous spirit. "Strong Stomach Essence" also contains a large amount of vitamin B, which is good for treating beriberi and leg swelling caused by vitamin B deficiency. It is purely benign and has no drawbacks.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Swelling of the Upper Edge of the Urethral Opening Is Most Likely to Infect Women During Intercourse <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou Ruqin, residing in a certain neighborhood on Zhejiang Road, previously contracted gonorrhea, which was then neglected and improperly treated. As a result, he developed a chronic condition, and urination was unusually painful. Gonorrheal filaments floated on the surface of the urine like willow catkins, with occasional traces of blood. The most difficult thing to cure was a slight swelling of the upper edge of the urethra, which the patient himself barely noticed. This was the result of my careful examination under a microscope. The local swelling was cloud-like in shape (as shown in Figure 1). Because of its location, it is most likely to infect his wife during intercourse. Therefore, Mr. Zhou's wife also contracted gonorrhea, resulting in pus and blood mixed in her vaginal discharge. Mr. Zhou was introduced by a friend to seek my treatment. The diagnostic result was as described above, but his testicles were also aching faintly, indicating a tendency to develop orchitis. Therefore, I prescribed German "Cleranon". After about three weeks, when he came for a follow-up visit, I saw that his urine was much clearer and his testicular pain had stopped, but the swelling of the upper edge of the urethral opening had not completely disappeared. I instructed him to continue taking "Cleranon". After another two weeks, I examined him with a microscope again and saw that the swelling and pain had completely disappeared and returned to normal, and the urine was also clear and free of any gonorrheal filaments. This is evidence of a radical cure. His wife's leukorrhea was treated by using "Karlsruhe vaginal suppositories" externally and taking "Cleranon" internally. Before long, she was also completely cured.</p>

<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Those who suffer from neurasthenia mostly also suffer from reproductive dysfunction. The reason is nothing more than a lack of hormones, and the nervous system lacks nutrition. Therefore, there are symptoms of brain weakness and insomnia, heart palpitations, forgetfulness, and dizziness. And below, there are diseases such as weak performance and nocturnal emission. I remember that after graduating from the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University and working in the hospital, there was a local young man named Vosnov, who suffered from incomplete development and small genitals due to excessive self-abuse in his childhood. Weak memory. Anemia and illness. And symptoms such as headache, tinnitus, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, and fatigue. He had been married for nine years without any children. He had lost his male ability, premature ejaculation, and weak erection. There is also nocturnal emission. I diagnosed it as a lack of hormones, so I prescribed the "Prostakern" hormone preparation, which had been tested for a long time, to increase development, and "Neres Anti-Emission Tablets" to treat nocturnal emission, working together. After taking only three bottles, his spirit was refreshed, he fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, and his essence was firm and his brain was healthy. After about two months of taking the medicine, not only did he fully develop, but his weight also increased every week, his complexion was ruddy, and his muscles were firm. The love between husband and wife increased tenfold; this was three years ago.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following drugs have been tested and proven effective by physicians graduating from medical universities at home and abroad. Buyers must recognize the name of the drug, and do not mistakenly believe people's words and buy miscellaneous cheap inferior drugs, which will increase the disease and endanger life!</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Poor Appetite</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Jin Zhaoji: Nocturnal emission, insomnia, and weak memory are caused by sexual neurasthenia. You can take "Prostakern". For those with poor appetite and indigestion, you can take "Strong Stomach Essence" to promote appetite, and your illness will be cured.</p>
<p>Husband and Wife with Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Ren Song: Since both husband and wife have gonorrhea, they should be treated at the same time to avoid mutual infection. You, sir, take "Cleranon", and it is even better to ask Dr. Yao Juyan for treatment. For your wife's gonorrhea, in addition to taking "Cleranon", use "Karlsruhe vaginal suppositories" as a suppository to avoid spreading the infection and treating both the symptoms and the root cause. For irregular menstruation and pregnancy cessation, you should also take "Gynaekon" to regulate menstruation and promote pregnancy.</p>
<p>Lung Disease</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yicen: Your illness has reached the second stage of lung disease, and it can still be effective if treated quickly. You can now take "Pulmonal" to suppress tuberculosis bacilli. On the one hand, take more nutrients, and your illness can be cured.</p>

<h3 id="e208">"Making Heroes Lose Heart" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>The Ping Social Affairs Bureau has banned the performances of "Fengbo Pavilion" and "Walking to Maicheng", the crime being that they "make heroes lose heart."</p>
<p>I lack a lot of knowledge about Peking opera, but I have seen both of these plays. Probably because I am not a "hero," I did not "lose heart." On the contrary, I respected and loved Guan Yu and Yue Fei even more: they really seemed like "heroes," unyielding until death.</p>
<p>The perspective of Peking opera is not very correct, that is the truth. But its shortcoming is not "making heroes lose heart," but rather feudal advocacy of blind loyalty and filial piety, as well as things like "chastity" and "martyrdom." Even if there are plays that "make heroes lose heart," it is definitely not "Fengbo Pavilion" or "Walking to Maicheng."</p>
<p>The stories of "Fengbo Pavilion" and "Walking to Maicheng" are generally known to most people, so there is no need to talk about them here. Although the causes of death of these two "heroes" are different—one died in resistance to the enemy and was killed unyieldingly, and the other was framed by a traitor and thus could not "drink to victory at Huanglong"—the admiration I, an ordinary person, have for these two "heroes" is the same. When we criticize Guan Yu and Yue Fei from the perspective of the modern era, there are certainly things that can be criticized. However, I absolutely believe in the saying "Generals should die on the battlefield, not in bed." Measuring Guan Yu and Yue Fei with this concept, I feel that Guan Yu and Yue Fei do not fail the word "hero."</p>
<p>As for saying that after watching "Walking to Maicheng" and "Fengbo Pavilion," it will "make heroes lose heart," this is probably the view of "modern heroes." As someone who is not a "hero," I only feel that Guan Yu and Yue Fei died as they should. If a "hero" unfortunately encounters such a situation, then such a death is truly what is called "heavier than Mount Tai." Of course, it is better to be able to avoid such misfortune and be able to live more meaningfully, but if you encounter it, it is also "glorious" and not "losing heart" in any way.</p>
<p>Not long ago, an old lady named Xiao in the north celebrated her birthday, and the performance was said to be very lively. Almost all of the top actors in the country were there. Recently, it is said that the 29th Army also specially invited the Fu Liancheng class. These two performances were both before the Ping Social Affairs Bureau explicitly prohibited them. I don't know if "Fengbo Pavilion" and "Walking to Maicheng" were included in the program? But based on conjecture, since those two plays "make heroes lose heart," they would probably be avoided. But what plays that "shouldn't make heroes lose heart" are performed? That is probably specially performing "sentimental stories" such as "Little Shepherd Boy" and "Baochan Delivering Wine"? Those plays are neither offensive nor quite in line with the way of "entertainment." Or, thinking that there are too few humorous plays, which, from a "hero's" perspective, lack dignity, then perhaps some elegant and suave "Meilong Town" or "Red-Haired Horse" are performed. These plays are not only elegant and suave, but also have the authority of "being the big brother." With a successful start and instant success, wouldn't that be the ultimate in "enhancing one's own prestige"?</p>
<h3 id="e209">After Seeing "Motherland" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>China Traveling Theater Performs at Carlton</p>
<p>The "China Traveling Theater," which has been away from us for three months, has now returned to Shanghai. This time, in addition to keeping "Thunderstorm," other meaningless so-called "technical samples" will reportedly be abandoned. In the current situation of national crisis and deepening national disaster, such a resolute decision is what every conscientious artist should have. And "Motherland," translated and directed by Mr. Chen Mian, is the first play in this new starting point. (I hope this observation is not wrong, in other words, the "China Traveling Theater" is "burying everything from the past to unfold a new future.")</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, "Motherland" certainly has many debatable points, but if we make a vertical observation of the "China Traveling Theater," then I dare say; "Motherland" is one of the most meaningful plays performed by the "China Traveling Theater." To borrow a phrase from Mr. Tang Jiqiu, "Motherland" is the closest to "not leaving the era, not leaving the big wind" among the plays of the "China Traveling Theater."</p>
<p>Naturally, precisely because it is meaningful, in addition to expressing our admiration, we will more strictly examine the weaknesses in "Motherland."</p>
<p>First of all, what I want to discuss with Mr. Chen Mian is the aspect of scene division. Based on my shallow experience, among the dramas I have seen, "Motherland" has the most number of acts, because the number of acts is large, the scenery, costumes, props, etc. cannot but be numerous, which is an obvious fact, and this does not seem very suitable for the Chinese theater industry, which is still economically weak. Secondly, because the background of each act is different, the disassembly and installation of each act takes a lot of time, which seems too uneconomical in terms of time. Taking this trial performance as an example, it took almost five hours from the opening to the closing. The staff on stage must be very tired, not to mention the fact that the audience also feels that the play is too long.</p>
<p>As for "Motherland" itself, I feel that several scenes can be deleted, such as the "Outside the City" in the third act, and the "Street" in the seventh act. It is not difficult to explain it clearly simply by adding a few lines in another act. And the second act, if it is properly merged with another act, I think it is not difficult to delete it, right? And the scenery like the third and seventh acts, let alone the fact that it is not easy to please.</p>
<p>I don't think it is a bad thing to modify a good play in order to get rid of the inessential and preserve the essence.</p>
<p>The country of Flanders in "Motherland" is very similar to our current "Motherland." The audience is moved by the patriotism of the patriots on stage, and then looks back at ourselves, so we can't bear to leave immediately. I think this is the most real reason why the audience doesn't "draw lots" [to leave early], but we can't just be satisfied with this. At the same time, I believe that if we modify it properly to make "Motherland" more compact, its power will be even greater. During the trial performance, the general audience was composed of highly educated intellectuals, who of course understand drama better than the average audience. Therefore, in order to consider the general audience, we should take into account their level of appreciation. After a very long time, if a scene suddenly relaxes, what kind of effect will this have? This really makes me "worry about the sky falling." I think the reason why "Thunderstorm" is a box office success and why the audience does not leave even though it takes more than four hours to perform is due to the tight writing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the performance of "Motherland" is only the new starting point of the "China Traveling Theater." If the box office is not very good because of the lack of form, this will make some people use it as an excellent piece of evidence to argue that "conscious plays" (there is such a strange term in the market) do not make money, and, in terms of the "China Traveling Theater's" finances, such a thing is of course undesirable.</p>
<p>A good play should not only have good content, but also a good form to coordinate with it in a unified way: the reason why some plays with very good content in the past did not sell well, allowing certain people to insult them at will, is precisely because of this.</p>
<p>As for the content of Motherland, generally speaking, it can be said to be very good. However, looking down on the enemy too much, thinking that they are all fools, will cause the audience to have a mentality of underestimating the enemy. In fact, the enemy is not only not confused, but may even be more shrewd than us. And the release of a patriot actually owes its blessing to the merciful daughter of the enemy marshal, and the marshal is actually unable to resist his daughter. This is an overly beautiful ideal.</p>
<p>There is a lot to say about directing, and the length of this article does not allow me to talk more about it, so I will omit it and wait for another opportunity to talk about it later. Next, I would like to say a few simple words about other aspects.</p>
<p>Stage setting and lighting were originally the strengths of the "China Traveling Theater," and this is not bad here either, except for the fact that the outdoor scene in the second act and the street in the seventh act are fundamentally difficult to please. Especially in the first act, the lighting makes people feel very good, but in the eighth act, there should have been some light outside the window first, and then it should have turned red, which would definitely make the audience feel more realistic and reduce the sudden feeling.</p>
<p>Probably because it was a preview, the actors' lines and movements were a bit stiff.</p>
<p>Tang Ruoqing's voice is much better than before. If she can pay more attention to her lines, her performance will definitely be more than this. Among all the actors in "Motherland", she is the best actress.</p>
<p>In short, this is the best play among the existing plays of the "China Traveling Theater." I dare to introduce it to you like this.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Mute <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>"Dad, it's terrible, there's a 'fallen one' (sick corpse) in our sorghum field."</p>
<p>The old man suddenly threw the hoe to the ground, turning his two lifeless fish eyes.</p>
<p>"What, let's go, go, go, damn it... you're the one who finds trouble."</p>
<p>"How am I, what if they die, then wouldn't that..."</p>
<p>"Don't say such unlucky things, if they die, I'll make you pay with your life!"</p>
<p>When the father and son angrily walked there, the naked person had already climbed into the bean sprouts to hide. The two of them stooped and walked in. The man was crawling under the lush green leaves, picking a handful of tender bean pods to eat. The old man's heart ached even more urgently. He walked over and kicked him, scolding:</p>
<p>"You troublemaker, get out of here!"</p>
<p>The man whimpered like a duck, pointed his finger at his mouth, and waved his hand. "Who's buying livestock with you? You're still using hand gestures!" The old man scolded angrily and was about to kick again when his son stopped him with his hand, saying:</p>
<p>"He's a mute, it's no use getting angry with him."</p>
<p>"Come on! Drag him out!"</p>
<p>The two men grabbed one arm each, and the mute cried out, shaking his head and trying to crawl without moving. The old man stared angrily, pained by the crushed bean sprouts. He also hated why this debtor only chose his field. He snorted, stepped over the mute, and like riding a horse, stretched his hands directly under the man's armpits, and lifted him up violently. The mute howled like a wolf and knelt down. The young man was stunned. When he saw the mute's sagging breasts, he cried out:</p>
<p>"Dad, don't move, it's a woman!"</p>
<p>The old man also sighed in dismay and drew back, feeling unlucky.</p>
<p>The two squatted down at the same time, looking annoyed at the woman lying in the dirt. At this time, someone on the path on the riverbank called:</p>
<p>"Little Pi, Little Pi, I've brought the food!"</p>
<p>The young man responded loudly. The old woman, hanging a large willow basket, walked over following the sound. She looked in surprise at her husband with his bristly beard, and stared straight at her son in the bean leaves. She put down the basket and moved a small pot of porridge down as well. There was a rustling sound in the bean sprouts, then a fluffy head popped out again, whimpering. The old woman said, not daring to move in shock:</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"A naked mute woman, what do you think we should do?"</p>
<p>As soon as the old woman walked in front of the mute, she whimpered again, grabbed the old woman's trouser legs, and dragged her down with all her might. The two struggled with each other until the old man went to pull his wife back.</p>
<p>The old woman calmed down and said:</p>
<p>"She's naked, she's afraid of seeing men." The old farmer narrowed his eyes and glanced at the bean leaves:</p>
<p>"Who has pants for her to wear!"</p>
<p>"If we ask the head of the village to send her away, and the village chief finds out, won't we have to spend more money?"</p>
<p>The old man handed the old patched blue cloth jacket from his shoulder to his wife and said, "Wrap it around her and send her to the woods in the Ma family's forest." Turning back, he ordered his son to carry the food basket, and he himself held the porridge pot, walked through the rustling sorghum stalks, and walked into the cornfield, turning his head and shouting:</p>
<p>"Send her over there, and bring back the jacket! What a curse..."</p>

<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>The owner of the Hongxing Opium and Cigarette Shop refused a customer who wanted to buy ×× brand cigarettes, "A woman knows nothing," slipped lightly from his throat. ×× brand cigarettes are quite popular in the market now, and many customers come to Hongxing Opium and Cigarette Shop every day to buy this brand. But the owner saw only a few basic cigarettes lying quietly in the cabinet and hit his own palm with his fist, grumbling at his old wife, "A woman knows nothing, ignoring good business and hiding the money to pay for your gold coffin and silver casket."</p>
<p>The Hongxing Opium and Cigarette Shop is located on a small, not-so-busy street. The shop's business still relies on Suzhou and Guangdong general merchandise. The proprietress is a shrewd woman and naturally unwilling to buy expensive ×× brand cigarettes to cater to the few customers. As soon as the owner grumbled, the proprietress immediately jumped up: "At this age, you still don't know how to do business. How many people can afford ×× brand! Kerosene is going to increase in price, and you still don't know to buy a few boxes to store away early."</p>
<p>The owner was henpecked. Although he was unhappy about turning away business, what was the point of buying more kerosene when there were already three large boxes in the shop? He glared at his wife, considering it a moral victory, and walked out of the counter. While the couple was bickering, a letter was dropped on the floor of the shop. The owner picked it up and, after seeing the three characters "Liu Caifu" clearly written on it, found another topic: "The semester is coming again. If you don't do more business, how do you expect to spend during the festival?" He shouted loudly to his son, " Fusheng, come and see what's written in this letter!"</p>
<p>The owner pulled out the letter, but besides the three characters "Liu Caifu," he couldn't recognize anything else.</p>
<p>Fusheng walked out of the inner room of the shop. He was used to the bickering of the old couple, and every resolution ended with Fusheng being dragged in and scolded. He stood blankly in front of his father, took the letter, and glanced sideways at his mother's face.</p>
<p>"School is about to start. It's a notice from the school."</p>
<p>"See!" The owner grabbed another topic: "It's asking for money again, asking for money again!"</p>
<p>The proprietress was calculating, figuring out whether it was worthwhile to buy a few boxes of kerosene. But the proprietress's abacus skills were not very good; the thirteen rods of the abacus seemed not enough for her to manage. She was trying to remember how many days the three boxes of kerosene she had in stock could last, while calculating on the abacus how much interest the capital for buying kerosene could generate. The owner's constant demands for money confused the numbers in her head and on the abacus, so she slammed the abacus down and rushed towards the owner (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening "Granny Gan's Evening Makeup"</p>
<p>The pond water rises, mooring fishing boats. Drooping willows, ten thousand strands. At dawn, one hears the sound of rowing awakening dreams. The pretty fisherwoman hurriedly throws off the quilt. She is thin and reluctant to get up. She is sleepy-eyed and afraid to look closely. She is too lazy to stretch her lotus-like arms while yawning. She is neatly fastening her cloth garment around her slender waist. One sees her propping a bamboo pole against the copper basin by the window. One sees her picking up clothes and adding a half-sleeve. One sees her lightly opening the mirror case and painting her eyebrows. And one sees her smoothing her hair with a sprig of spring cloud, twisting her hair into a snake-like style. Opening the powder box, she gathers her hands. She lightly applies rouge to her cherry lips, reflecting in the water, startling the shadow of a wild goose. And she carefully draws her eyebrows with willow charcoal. Words cannot describe her graceful demeanor and charming appearance. A single glance is enough to captivate one's soul. The fisherwoman finishes her makeup, puts away the case, and beckons to the net-weaving boat. Suddenly, one hears the light sound of oars.</p>

<p>Opening "Chai Tou Feng" (Phoenix Hairpin)</p>
<p>Sentimentality is, in fact, a form of infatuation. Beautiful women with tragic fates have existed since ancient times. I, Zhuanxian, lost my parents at a young age and had no one to rely on. I, alone, am raised as a daughter-in-law in the Lu family. The aunt arranged the marriage out of righteousness. The family happily lived together but then disaster came. Even more touching was the expression of deep affection. Soft whispers filled with tenderness. I hate only the nun who was greedy for donations. I regret not having kindly advised her to avoid creating enmity. The Phoenix Hairpin was shattered unintentionally. This unexpected misfortune was not light. Stirring up trouble was merely to seek revenge. How can a nun be like this in the world? Slanderous words were used to harm me. I suffered all kinds of hardships and grievances. The aunt's anger did not subside but worsened. She caused me to be alone in the temple, suffering bullying. The evil nun plotted to seduce me. I vowed to protect my chastity and refused to comply. My good husband knew nothing and went away to take the exam. My heart was filled with sorrow; to whom could I tell my story? Although my husband has returned and we have had the good fortune to meet, I am even more saddened. The lotus and the barbs have already been formed. Alas, how can I bear to read the poem of heartbrokenness? Alas, teardrops stain my silk handkerchief. Alas, thoughts come to mind, and it is difficult to fall asleep. Alas, I toss and turn all night, unable to sleep. Alas, my haggard appearance is afraid to face the mirror. Alas, I am truly ill on my silk quilt. Alas, the zither should continue the lingering sound of our love. Alas, just as I am about to die, my mother-in-law calls. I cannot serve and care for her morning and evening. I wish to express my sorrow for now. Please forgive your unfilial daughter-in-law. This karma was destined in a previous life. Why blame others for the torment? I only hope that heaven knows my intentions. In this life, drifting like duckweed. I am willing to close my eyes and be in darkness in both worlds.</p>

<p>Distressed Miss Chen Bo'er</p>
<p>It was such a ghostly forest, a gloomy and decaying temple, so desolate that even the presiding monk had long disappeared. Hidden inside were a group of revolutionaries, a group of young men and women living under the initial warlord rule. These were Yuan Muzhi, Chen Bo'er, Li Qing, Ying Yin, Yao Ping, Qian Qianli, Sun Jing, Tian Chen, etc. in "With One Heart."</p>
<p>Director Ying Yunwei, in order to increase the chilling atmosphere of the decaying temple, specially hired two special actors. That night, Ying Yunwei said to Chen Bo'er, "The two special actors who will be acting with you are here." Pointing to a jar next to her, she looked at it and said with a frightened expression, "Is that what you talked to me about yesterday?" It turned out that what was placed inside was a wriggling snake and a pair of rats. "The snake will crawl by your side, and the rats will step on your feet," Ying Yunshu continued, startling Chen Bo'er to scream.</p>
<p>Immediately, under the teasing of the director and the workers, the snake was given a rehearsal, climbing on the body of the Jade Emperor statue. Suddenly, the person holding the snake let go, and the snake flew down from the air, startling all the staff and visitors present.</p>
