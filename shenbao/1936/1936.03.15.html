<p>柏林　此間現料德政府將於今晚績發文吿、聲明其對於現局之態度、大的爲公報方式、政界預料今夜希特勒在慕尼黑之演說、大的將對政局作較和平之决斷、現無理由可測度德國將拒絕接受參與國聯行政院會議之請書、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政院開會　各國華表演說　法要求物品適當辦法應付德國廢約行爲英對法比表示同情</h3>

<p>倫敦國聯會行政院開會之後、英國外相艾登當卽發表演說、旋由法國外長佛蘭亭起立致詞、聲明六項意見、　德國在宣吿廢止羅卡諾公的之際、立卽遣派軍隊開入萊茵河非武裝區域、依照該國官方所發表之數字、正式軍隊開入萊茵河區域者已有三萬員名之多、自不能以「象徵的部隊」視之、　法國頃以此案提付國聯會行政院處理、實乃義務所在、但法國幷未採取軍事措置、　德國廢的口實、乃謂法俄互助公的、係與羅卡諾公的相牴觸、法國業已提出答辯幷提議提付海牙國際法庭裁决、詎意德國不允照辦、反將該國自由簽訂之條的、宣吿廢止、抑知羅卡諾公的第八條、原已規定各簽字國、不得擅自宣吿廢止、必須經由國聯會、行政院三分二之多數表决通過、始得予以廢止、　依照羅卡諾公的第二條第一項、凡違反凡爾賽和的第四十二第四十三兩條、而在萊茵河非武裝區域重行設防者、卽係一種侵略行爲、自當依法處理、　德國廢的之後、法國與集體安全制暨國聯會、均戚受危險、　德國前於一九三五年三月十五日宣佈恢復徵兵制、行政院當於是年四月十七日、通過决議案、加以糾正、法國政府茲耍求付諸實施云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦國聯會行政院非常會議、頃於本日午前十一時四十分、舉行公開會議、法國外長佛蘭亭常卽發表演說、比國內閣總理齊蘭旋亦繼起發言云、「羅卡諾公約與國聯會盟約、均屬比國外交政策之基礎、比國與德國之邊界錢較之他國爲長、其防務比較爲弱、自德國廢止羅卡諾公約以後、比國所戚威脅、亦較任何國爲甚、加之德國廢的所援引之口實、乃係法俄兩國互助公的、此與比國毫不相涉、未可牽强附會、實則羅卡諾公的、乃德國自由簽訂、其所規定之義務、亦屬相互的、比國自認爲仍有履行之必要、比國雖準備締結新條的、用以改造歐洲、但在目前、不得不要求國聯會行政院、决定德國廢約之舉、實違反凡爾賽條的第四十二第四十三兩條並將通吿簽字各國云、齊蘭發言旣畢、會議卽宣吿延會、至下星期一日午後三時三十分再開、（十四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>羅卡諾公約國　意見稍見接近　仍續開會議</h3>
<p>倫敦羅卡諾公的各簽字國會議、於午後五時三十分在外務部繼續開會、至七時三十分始畢、英國財相張伯倫最先出外、面露憂色、掌璽大臣哈利法克斯勛爵、與意國大使格蘭第接踵而出、格蘭第亦有憂容、出會塲後立卽驅車返大使館、據會議發表公報稱、「羅卡諾公的各簽字國、本日繼續舉行小組會議、以研究時局形勢、討論之際、各該國所持見解、顯已趨於接近、此層自足欣幸、下决會議、現已定於明日午後五時舉行」云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦羅卡諾公的各簽字國會議、昨日午後開會後？當於七時三十分發表公報云、各關係國所具見解、顯已趨於接近、茲悉英法兩國互相接近之點、卽法比兩國遭受德國攻擊時、英國究應如何加以援助、其所担負之義務若何、業允予以確定、至法國對於德國、原主採取制裁手段、且已提出若干要求、茲允暫行减輕此種要求、關於此層、頃據消息靈通人士稱、各報與此間金融界有力份子、均以爲德國內部經濟情形、業已捉襟見肘、今後德國向外國購買貨物時、祇須令其繳納現欵、並將目下通行而有利於該國之軋帳制度、停止實施、則該國自必益感困難、是亦一種制裁手段云（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦羅卡諾公的各簽字國會議、曾於昨日委託比國國務總理齊蘭草擬備忘錄一伴、以備提交國聯會行政院討論、齊蘭卽於昨晚會同比國代表團人員澈夜工作、至今晨脫稿、羅卡諾公的各簽字國會議、本日午後開會時、當將此項備忘錄提出研究、據一般人所知、備忘錄內容有兩要點、　說明昨日會議所表示之見解、（指比法英意四國、均認德國行動、係違反凡爾賽條的與羅卡諾公的之行爲而言）　陳述四國所已同意之各點、卽（甲）在國聯會範圍內、維持集體安全之原則、（乙）比法英意四國均抱避免戰事之决心、關淤此層、齊蘭總理曾在會議中主張、四國代表當於晚間開會研究未來對德制裁辦法、應實施至何種程度、始不致發生戰爭危險、因此一般人預料關係各國雖將採取各種步驟、使德兵退出萊茵河沿岸、但此種步驟之性質、當不至於引起戰爭也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對德制裁　英法各有懷抱　德軍退至萊茵河右岸將爲此後對德要求說</h3>
<p>倫敦羅卡諾公的簽字國代表今晨十一時在此舉行非公開會議、雖志在解决德國廢的事之努力進行不速、然欲得一種和解姿勢、如允將遣入萊茵地之軍隊、撤至萊茵河右岸等舉、旣未承認、亦未古認、是以德元首希特勒今晚在慕尼黑之演詞、極爲人所注意、以其可表示德國態度也、聞拒絕德國各種出口貨、並限制其若干進口貨之議、現已不成問題、因列强意見不一、此議窒碍難行也、聞法國計畫在停止對德票據淸算之恊定、德國財政現已困難、如此舉實施、則可迅速發生效力、惟此計畫不爲荷蘭與阿眞廷所贊同、不過談話猶在進行中、小恊約國之代表昨夜集議研究時局、主席爲羅外相、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦此間外交界人士今日表示、英國對於法國所提對德實施經濟財政之制裁、已予柜絕、故羅卡諾簽字國希望於星期六國聯行政院開會表决對德制裁問題前解决歐洲危局之努力、已成僵局、法國自得蘇俄方面不惜以軍事援助之擔保後、今日拒絕考慮准許德軍援助萊茵之建議、法國並曾提議實施制裁、但英國之此舉甚易引起戰事、不願負擔此項危險、但法國仍堅持行政院首應嚴懲德國、然後再考慮制裁德國廢止羅卡諾條的及佔據萊茵之辦法、法國曾要求英國在原則上擁護制裁、然未提供特殊之方案、消息靈通方面聲稱、法國現擬封鎖德國之對外輸出及制止以資金借與德國、羅馬尼亞外長鐵杜樓斯哥今日曾往訪蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫、據聞二人所討論者、係聯絡小協的及巴爾幹各國共同要求制裁之問題、法俄今日對於英國之觀望政策、表示不滿、對於英國工黨之態度允深憤慨、曾非正式宣稱、工黨過於親德、但柏林方面傳來之私人消息、則謂德參謀部因懼法國或將進攻萊茵、漸感不安云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦關於對德實施制裁問題、羅卡諾公的各簽字國會議、目前尙未採取决定、法國佛蘭亭外長、當於下星期中返國、與內閣磋商此事、一俟佛蘭亭重來此間之後、卽將再度提出討論也、據一般人所知、法國現仍主張實施制裁、惟英此兩國不甚贊同、至於意國則採取保留態度云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英外部門庭若市　德使亦訪艾登　但謂未提出新建議</h3>
<p>倫敦據官塲聲稱、英政府尙未與柏林通訊、德國方面亦未提出安靖大局之正式建議、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦此間金融界方面傳說、德國對於撤退萊茵河一部份駐軍、卽所謂「象徵的退兵」、可在若干條件下、加以接受、惟此說尙未證實、德國大使赫許、頃於午後五時訪問艾登外相、談至五時三十五分始興辭而出、據外務部人士所知、赫許係就德國在萊茵河沿岸重行設防問題，以德國之見解、向艾登外相補充說明、此在德國人士則謂、該國並未以關於萊茵河設防問題之任何新意見、提交英國、赫許大使之訪問外務部、係爲英德兩國簽訂雙方海軍協定問題、與海軍專家克萊奇有所商談云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦法國不管部閣員彭古今日乘飛機抵此、携有法國參謀本部關於德軍進駐萊茵之報吿、該報吿以爲德國空軍有襲擊英國之威脅、此項報吿卽將提交英外相艾登、（十三日國民社電）</p>
<p>倫敦羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥。南斯拉夫駐法公使布利區。捷克駐英公使瑪薩利克、今晚在此間舉行小協商各國會議、事後發表公報稱、「小恊商各國對於德國廢止羅卡諾公的一舉、所採態度、完全一致」云、蒂杜樓斯哥與布利區二人、並曾與法國佛蘭亭外長先後舉行談話、（十三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　外傳蘇俄與羅馬尼亞現方進行談判、擬締訂兩國互助條的、政府前曾一度吾認、衆議院頃間開會時、外交决長拉狄賴斯哥、代表政府再度吾認此說、獨立自由黨領袖白拉西亞諾、向政府提出質問、謂聞政府業已採取必要措置、俾使全國鐵路、凖備齊全、可於短時期內、將蘇俄軍隊軍火、自該國邊界運至捷克邊界、此說是吾確鑿、當由內務部長股古萊資代表政府正式予以吾認、並謂「在現狀之下、此種無稽謠言、足以淆惑人心」、宜嚴加譴責云云、（十三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>萊茵河畔　德將建築砲臺　駐軍現有三萬人</h3>
<p>柏林今日柏林發表之公報、載有關於德國擬在萊茵建築砲臺之言論謂德國必須有權建築砲臺或防禦錢、將純屬防衛性質、以保護德國西陲、此種砲臺綫需數年始可築成、但爲安全起見、德國不能放棄其在西境設防之權利云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林希特勒元首因歐洲局勢有急遽之變化、頃已取消其預定赴各地之選舉演說、遄返柏林、抵京後卽與國社黨最高領袖舉行緊急會議、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>柏林德軍今日在萊茵區域舉行操演、藉以對於外國報紙所傳、現已撤退若干軍隊以緩和時局之說、作有力之否認、宣傳部發言人今日聲稱、現在萊茵軍隊至少有三萬人、中有當地警察一萬一千人、此項軍隊將留駐其地、但對於倫敦方面所傳德國參謀部深懼法國進攻萊茵之說拒絕表示意見、多數德人對於德國重返國聯、表示懷疑、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦每日電聞報外交記者頃宣稱、德國現在萊茵河區域之兵力、如將正式軍隊與軍事性質團體合併計之、總數當有二十四萬八千員名、其中正式軍隊三萬員名、警察卽將編入正式軍隊者三萬、員名、經過軍事訓練之勞動服務隊三萬名、軍事性質團體十五萬員名、奧國國社黨客籍軍八千乃至一萬員名、此外、尙有摩託化軍隊若干隊云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林羅卡諾公的廢止之後、人民對於外交形勢頗感不安、各報多發表意見以安慰之、或謂時局不致發生意外、或謂羅卡諾公的各簽字國在倫敦所舉行之會議、可與去歲之斯特萊柴會議等量齊觀、半官式外交通信報、則因外國方面傳聞德國允在萊茵河區域不設防禦工事、藉以便利談判之進行、特加以吾認、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意國官塲　靜觀倫敦形勢　一般人則漸感不安</h3>
<p>羅馬意國官塲雖以恬靜態度視察倫敦談話之結果、但一般人因見時局現已緊張、漸呈不寗氣象、聞洛迦諾公的簽字國今日在倫敦集議時、意代表格蘭第聲稱、歐洲局勢自大戰以還、未有若目前之嚴重者、其故爲列强在日內瓦採行專橫而不公道的制裁政策也、阿比西尼亞問題、一日不照公道主張而解决之、則列强一日不能希望意國除抱觀望態度外、有其他行動云、意代表此言已將阿國問題與萊茵事件併爲一談、就此言察之、意國不願贊助對德制裁、惟負責方面吾認意國刻向法國談判撤銷制裁之說、（十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本財政方針及其對中國的影響</h3>
<p>— 禾</p>
<p>日本馬塲新藏相。和高橋故藏相的兩種財政方針是相反的。前者是增稅。增發公債。實行對滿政策。促進國防的充實。後者則是反對增稅。强行减債。對滿政策的消極。抑壓國防費的增加。日本報紙一向所譏笑的「高橋財政讀本。」受著財閥實業家的歡迎。差不多一般人都知道了。本文所要探討的就是馬塲財政方針及其對中國的關係。</p>
<p>我們且不說在退出倫敦軍縮會議後的日本。造船的競爭。已成必然之勢。就是日本要擴大再生產。以維持建筑在軍需工業景氣上面的繁榮。也少不得增强軍費的要求。在那樣農村破產達於極點。國民幾被　到饑餓綫的國家。膨脹軍費。只有增稅和增發公債。用直接稅加在貧苦大衆的肩上。所得的結果怎樣。本屆總選舉中無產黨的勝利。就是明白的等答覆。至於增發公債會有怎樣結果呢。我們知道「赤字」的增加。容易釀成「惡性的通貨膨脹。」到那時物價提高。工資上升。輕工業部門因成本增大而减少對外貿易競爭的力量。自然亦蒙受其害。而且公債發行額近百億圓。幾達飽和點了。現在再一意增發。三井·三菱·住友·安田·及第一五大財閥素來所抱的「財政破產」的躭憂只有更加濃厚。所以馬塲十日的聲明。在方才開拍之股票交易所就引起了各證券的一齊下落。</p>
<p>再就一九三五年軍事費的投放來看。民間軍需工廠所接受的定單。海軍二億七千七百萬圓。陸軍一億六百萬圓（其餘投於國家工廠。）計三億八千三百萬圓。（海軍達陸軍之二倍半。大部份爲三菱及川崎兩造船所瓜分。）現在軍費膨脹聲中。那些重佔優勢的重工業家以及相關的財閥。由於軍需工業上官利的獲得。雖被抽收了資本所得稅。仍然有利可圖。感到不滿的只有輕工　家。可是對華貿易的「空前好轉。」亦足緩和後者的反感。而况馬塲已經聲明增稅要延到明年舉行呢。全日本的有產者。所以只要求新藏相說明增發公債所取的方法。原因就在此。</p>
<p>然而我們最當注意的。還不是上面所述。而是日本對滿投資方針的轉變。日本的資本家。爲著「滿鐡代軍部服務」的非難。曾經利用了高橋的消極政策。促關東軍的反省。結果不獨有許多重要的工廠。不能開工。滿鐡的增資變爲紙上空談。就是軍部要使成爲第二滿鐡的興中公司。亦陷於無法進展之境。現在日政府一反高橋所爲。使資本源源流入滿洲。則不僅促遠東三省的工業化。卽對中國的經濟侵略。在十河信二指揮之下。亦將益加凶猛。經濟的侵略。離不開軍事。軍事的行動。或亦不免日趨激烈。處這兩大利器——經濟與軍事——夾攻之下。中國民族資本勢將由壓迫排擠。而宣告死刑。中國國民經濟勢將加速地破產下去。我們還可以不趕緊謀自救的辦法麼。</p>

<h3>川行散記</h3>
<p>— 紀難</p>
<p>一「三峽天下險」</p>
<p>「劍閣天下雄，峨嵋天下秀，三峽天下險」這三句話在四川人的嘴裏是常常說得怪響亮的，好似江浙人說着「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」一樣。所謂三峽，就是西林峽，巫山峽，和瞿塘峽。大江從四川內地，匯合岷江，沱江，嘉陵江，烏江，開江大小諸支流傾瀉而下，到奉節，就緊束於數百里巉岩削檗的中間，形成三峽之險。在地質學說起來，三峽的成因乃是宜昌以上的大江，因她盤上升，而上升的速度不及江流衝刷的速度，谷道衝刷而高度不變，所以成爲峽谷。其間礁多水淺，航行之險，夙著史冊。從前不通汽船的時候，客貨運輸，祗有靠木船。下行可以順流而下，上行則完全用縴夫牽曳，寸步艱難。縴夫手胼足胝，匍伏着眞同牛馬一般。如果過到巉岩絕壁，手足無可攀援的地方，那末祗好停泊，等順風纔能前進。所以從前從宜昌到重慶，常常累月始達，而危險更是無時無地沒有的。</p>
<p>一八九九〇年三月九日英人立樂德氏（Mr．Archibald　Little）的小汽船利川號的到達重慶，宜吿了川江試航的成功。後來立氏又聘專家蒲南田氏（C．SPlant）到川，，測量河流礁石，安建浮標，標桿，使航行更加安全。所以現在我們輸舶，能够往來無阻於川江之中了。</p>
<p>西陵峽跨湖北的秭歸巴東兩縣，因山勢奇幻，又小別爲黃牛峽，牛肝馬肺峽，和兵書寳劍峽。峽多險灘，而崆嶺，新灘，洩灘允爲峽中的三大險。黃牛峽江流紆曲，童山濯濯，好像牧童產牛，人黑牛黃。古諺有「朝見黃牛，暮見黃牛，三朝三暮，黃牛如故。」可以想見當時舟行之苦。入牛肝馬肺峽後，最先過崆嶺。山更高，峽更險。在江流轉灣的地方，江中忽然湧現數十丈的大石，把水流分爲兩道。南漕亂石梗塞，，不通舟楫。北槽則有暗礁三，位如品字，共問幾不容舸。輪船經過，必須曲折避讓。毫厘失顧，立刻觸礁。所以船家有「新灘洩灘不算灘，崆嶺才是鬼門關」之謠。過這「鬼門關就看見北岸峭壁上，高懸着兩掛鐘乳，一則輪廓尖薄像肝，一則形態圓鈍如肺，牛肝馬肺峽就是從此得名的。</p>
<p>兵書寳劍峽，又名米倉峽。絕壁撑天，與水面完全垂直。稜稜白色，不生草木。北岸山勢最削，南岸較坦。新灘就是牛肝馬肺峽至此的一段短程。新灘坡度極大，猶山峰之沒於水底，加以亂石橫江，所以極難上駛。河幅逼窄，蓄水如閘，狂奔而下，勢如瀑布。輪船過此，有時雖開足機力，猛力上衝，仍被擊退，這種時候祇能絞灘。絞灘是這地方的居民恃以爲生的一種專業，首事者登高一呼，頃刻而集者，男女老幼，可達數百人。他們攀得輪上鐵索，吆喝拉牽，再把另一端絞入船頭的轆轤，就可以得勢而上了。</p>
<p>過兵書劍峽後，西陵峽已盡。江面豁然開朗，山勢亦較爲平易。卽使偶有嵯峨，也逈異峽中的峻削了。</p>
<p>過巴東縣，卽入四川境進巫山峽了。峽中陰晴無定，變化悠忽，雲深穴暝，草密山寒，夾岸連峯峭壁，氣勢不斷。曉霧漫山，峯多積雪，曜若天衢，峽流尙平，據說洪水時凶險異常。北岸奇峯競起，最爲峭麗，令人應接不暇。絕壁草蘚，奇紋如繡，作老蒼古翠之色。仰空一綫，陰氣襲人。周遭景物，瞬息萬變。船行萬山叢中，不知來處，眞是到了「山重水複疑無路」的境界。</p>
<p>巫山有峯十二：望霞，翠屏，朝雲（卽神女峯），松巒，集仙，聚鶴，浮壇，上昇，起雲，飛鳳，登龍，聖泉。江中祇見峯巒雜疊無從識別，大概都各肯其形。獨神女峯立於兩尖峯的旁邊，宛如人形。山翠氤氳中，仰見這娟妙的山峯，彷彿是神女的烟鬟霧髯。難怪神女的故事，也正是我國最富詩意的神話。巫山峽盡，卽爲巫山縣。縣治在陽臺之下，那就是宋玉高唐賦中朝雲暮雨的陽雲臺。夜來枕藉舟中，不知神女可來入夢？</p>
<p>决日，入瞿唐峽。飛岩突壁，奇險欲絕。石色靑黃紅黑，與樹木交映，形成一幅異常富麗的圖畫。崩崖裂石，壁立千尋，疑爲刀斧之工，說者謂爲大禹闢峽的遺跡。仰視上蒼，有如匹練，「天窄壁面削」，可謂絕詠了。峽口，山勢連貫而中斷如截，兩壁相距如門，故有夔門之稱。門口偏北的中流，屹立大石，卽瀧澦堆。堆周圍十餘丈，高數十尺。據說漲水的時候，爲洪旋的中心，行舟極險。昭烈托孤的白帝城，就在堆側的小山上。依山城廓，隱的於荒烟蔓草之中而已。上流卽奉節縣城，古夔國也。魚復浦在其東，有武侯所遺八陣圖。船上遠望，僅亂石數堆，未見有若何奇幻之處。相傳陣圖爲兵勢行藏之理，也許是後人附會之說。</p>
<p>夔門以上，景象開拓，七百里三峽，已經完全通過，其間西陵壁嶂，稜削如白骨，最爲幽靜。巫山靑翠，峭麗無匹。瞿塘多赤壁，勝以奇偉。出峽回望，速峯際天，萬山叢沓。追憶險峻，如歷鬼國。詩情畫意，盡在此中了。</p>
<p>奉節至重慶，山勢平坦，石色赭黃，不像峽中的靑黑。雲影山光，風帆沙鳥，較之峽中的奇峯異嶂，觸目驚心，無足述矣。不過江中暗礁淺瀨，遍地皆是，所以險灘仍多。如雲陽萬縣間的新龍灘，萬縣忠州間的狐灘，酆都涪州間的觀音灘，都是絞而後過的。</p>

<p>西陲通訊</p>
<h3>靑海旅行記（續）</h3>
<p>— 荘學本</p>
<p>艷裝的歌舞</p>
<p>此地流行的道喇，很像西康的「跳鍋裝，」和塘巴堡歌而不舞的又不同。</p>
<p>當我們初來的第二天，李土司找了一班男女來，在他的庭中表現道喇給我們看，我們也沽酒獎勵他們。</p>
<p>男子，阿姑，婦人，都有，開始站成一個圓圈。且走且唱，且唱且舞，舞的動作多舉手轉身作揖。舉動很快，和川邊西戎調情的小歌裝很彷彿。曲子很短，一曲旣畢，舉杯傳飲。</p>
<p>因爲她們穿的多是五色的衣服，所以舞動時很覺得艷麗有趣。歌聲也清脆悅耳。女子的尖音，大有響徹雲霄之槪。但是他們很散漫；聲音不和諧一致，動作也不很整齊，參加道喇的男女，進退隨便，這因爲他們的習慣，放浪不羈，就在平素道喇的時候，也是同樣的紊亂。</p>
<p>後來我們將土人常唱而比較好聽的一隻道喇譯音了出來，歌名「Slon　Kua　Nyo」，歌的意義問了許多土人都說不出來，所以無從翻譯。譜仍由柯先生製的。</p>
<p>桃色的夜會</p>
<p>這幾天正在新年裏，所以很熱鬧，大家也特別的快樂，他們沒有盪秋千。而拋綫球踢毽子也是阿姑和小孩子們在白天常玩的娛樂。但是終比不上晚間的娛樂有意思，他們新年中自元旦起，直到元宵止，這半個月中，每晚多有道喇和遊戲。參加的角色，大都是阿姑，和壯年的男子，已婚的男女很少，過期的老年絕對沒有，凑熱鬧的小孩子則特別的多。</p>
<p>我們晚飯以後，也每天去參觀他們的夜會，地點就在荘前白楊林底下的荘園，沉沉夜幕籠罩了大地，半灣新月在白楊的樹梢上徘徊，燦爛星光俯視着這個空曠的塲合。先有幾個已經吃過夜飯的男女在塲中間溜。寒風叫得他們發抖，大家呼喚起來，響亮的唿哨喚來了許多土人。大家撿拾柴草，在塲角中燃起一堆大火，互相擠攏來，烤着，談着，笑着。當火焰不能持久而低下去的時候，一二個男女起來喚道喇！道喇！大家聞聲就一閧起來歌舞了，挑一二個旁觀的孩子，不動的站在中央，作爲他們走圈的中心。亂歌亂舞了一陣，一對一對的男女溜出去在黑暗中私談，嬉笑。道喇的人數少了，也就漸漸的散去。「及而哈」！忽然的有一二個人又叫起來，四面對對的情侶，振衣而起，圍攏來作「捕羊戲」。拿兩個阿姑，分作羊羣的頭和尾；中間聯着許多男女，一個單獨的男子，作爲狼。狼追逐羊尾，羊頭來回的　護她，奔逐久之，直到狼捕到了羊尾，暫告終止。還有一種「禿龍」，是「猫捉老鼠」的游戲，一充鼠，一作猫。鼠在一圈聯手的人腑下奔逃，猫跟着鼠的路綫追逐，這都是他們常玩的游戲。</p>
<p>在這樣熱鬧的黑暗中，男女間喁喁情話，耳鬢厮磨，視爲常事。有時女子假作不高興的時候，性如烈火的男子把阿姑摔在地上，胡摸一陣。但是阿姑多是天足，也有相當的　力，時常她們聯合二三個阿姑，去玩弄一個俏皮的男子，抱頭拉足，互相合作，把他摔在地上，拖他幾丈。又怕他的報復，就一閧散去。</p>
<p>土人都還沒有見過電筒，當我們用電筒照射他們時，有幾個跑上來呼呼的要吹熄牠，這樣更增加了夜總會的熱鬧。</p>
<p>塲角情人的私語，綿綿的不歇，無情的新月，已在西山上催着大家回去，這時睺也有分開散去的，也有分不開的。粉紅色的夜會，就此閉幕，待着明天新月在林時，再行繼續。</p>
<p>抬神去治病</p>
<p>他們很不講衛生，疾病很多，性病也普遍。另外十分之一的土人中，有「　拉」病，頸間生出一個醜陋的肉瘤，這一種症象，在荘族中很普遍，西戎稱爲「猴兒色」。</p>
<p>土人生病不知醫藥，大多請神還願。</p>
<p>一天的早上，我在「彭康」前散步，樹林中付出一陣鑼聲，後來遠遠的見到一個土人擎着「護法神箭」，一手執着鑼，後面四個人抬着一隻大椅，坐一個女神的型像。前面的人擎着鑼，在村荘中繞了出來，經過「彭康」，忽將女神倒抬，他們一路又向北，我跟着過去，走了一段，四個抬椅子的人，忽然將女神抬着左右亂轉，幾分鐘以後，力乏了，頭眩了；椅子的槓子，就在白楊樹上亂碰，人也幾乎不由自主的倒下來。我對於他們這樣瘋狂的舉動，簡直莫明其妙，一刻又敲鑼抬着走了。後來問土人，　知道是請神赴家治病的一　，抬的女神，是荘廟中的「九天玄女娘娘」。</p>
<p>語言與文字</p>
<p>土人文化很落後；他們本來祗有語言，而無文字。</p>
<p>語言到處都能相通，塘巴堡和桑思格不同的僅屬幾個名詞。土語和蒙古語也能相通；少數的名詞，又和青海西番語相同。這因爲土人適介在蒙荘兩大民族之間，而受着蒙藏語的影響。他們的語音中，母音　　　很多。語句的組織，也是名詞在前，動詞或助詞在後，例如：吃飯，他們就叫「飯吃」。一隻牛，他們叫「牛一隻」。</p>
<p>但是現在他們的土語漸將失傳了，一般男女老幼多會講漢語，遇到漢人的時候，他們很能用漢語作對答。雖然他們土人間的談話，仍用土語，而許多艱難的名詞，還是用漢語作代替。所以純粹的土語，現在除非幾個老年人外，年輕的問他們都答不上來。</p>
<p>他們通用的漢文，契約書信多用漢字，而讀書識字的人很少，除非幾個附近縣城的村荘。男子們旣不種田，又不讀書，他們不讀書的理由，大致就因爲懶惰。當喇嘛的土人，多讀藏文，所以土人又通行藏文，但是藏文祗有在宗敎上應用。</p>
<p>清靜的寺院</p>
<p>桑思格上面十里，一所佑寗寺，那裏有三百個土人喇嘛，當然是土人中間最大的寺院。內部分爲五襄：土觀襄，章嘉襄，松布襄，却荘襄，王襄，每一個襄——廟——中，多有一位「呼圖克圖」主持，全寺以土觀呼圖克圖主持的土觀襄爲最大。現在宣化內蒙的章嘉呼圖克圖，他就是章嘉襄的主持者。</p>
<p>寺院比櫛在葱籠的柏林中，前後夾着兩片高山，一條溪水洄流在寺前，風景的雄壯淸麗，紅崖子溝無出其右。</p>
<p>我們第一次騎着馬去，先被幾個紅衣的喇嘛邀在客室中飲濃厚的酥油茶。土觀呼圖克圖的管家提進一更哈達和一張「妙智禪師」的名片，他因病不能接見。我們去參觀宏麗的大殿，淄金的佛像，和柱上護着大栽絨的龍氈，顯出寺中是富有的。幾個土女正掮着經書環殿作祈禱。章嘉襄在大殿的下面，吾們去時管家的出去了，推進殿門顯得非常狹小，如果不說是章嘉活佛的廟子，誰都會悮會普通的一所小廟。但是他殿中供的一枝神箭，據說是全寺最靈驗的護法。我們正要出去，管家的回來了，問起章嘉活佛，　知道他出門已有二十多年了。</p>
<p>大殿後面的岩上，還有二所廟子，我們循着山徑上去，一路多是翠柏仁樹，在樹蔭的深處，有四五對像孔雀沒有長尾的「馬雞」：跳　着在樹林中拾食，見了我們也不驚飛，也不躲避。我們正想攝影的時候，前面岩石上忽然竄下一隻灰毛的獐子，繞過我們的足前，跑進深林中去了。這樣翩然的感覺，眞有非塵世的印象。由此上去，沒有數步，就到二所清靜的廟子。這裏是土觀活佛坐井的禪房，裏面佈置，很簡單，憑着窗欄，是一幅天然的蒼天白雲，遠山近水的畫圖。到此境界，誰都有出塵之想了。</p>
<p>寺院臨在山口，午後起了一陣大風，帶着黃沙石子刮上我們的面部，我們就馬上加鞭回去了。</p>
<p>土人的社伏</p>
<p>第二次來寺，在初八跳神的那天，寺中每年的正月初八，按例跳社伏一次。那天早上新裝的土人，來趕會的很多，少數附近的蒙人，番人，也多來　　。</p>
<p>我們到的時候，大殿前已圍得人山人海，三百個紅衣喇嘛趺坐在廣場中念經，一個十幾歲的松布活佛，被幾個方丈——堪布——擁在面北的大椅上，七八個化裝跳神的小鬼拿紅棒在人羣中維持秩序，人們悮踏進那圈綫，就要受到鬼棒的賞賜。</p>
<p>喇嘛們經念畢以後，一個執護法神箭的喇嘛，從正殿中走下埸來，他　手又挨着神箭，頸中縛緊了哈達，開始發神。一班喇嘛煨起柏枝煙，薰他的週身，又朝着他一陣的誦經，發神的喇嘛逐漸戰慄了，愈戰愈烈，直至他不能支持的時候，四個喇嘛抬起一盤綹粑——炒麺——，在他面前；他就扶起好支搖動的神箭，將簡頭在綹粑中挑了一下，一個喇嘛就去卜今年荘稼的豐歉。</p>
<p>跳神——接着開始，先在埸中堆起幾十担饝饝；殿中吹出一陣嗚嗚的罔筒聲，跟着戴黃雞冠帽的喇嘛走下殿來，囌哪皮鼓響個不停，四個白衣骷髏的Gol下了石階，繞着饝饝堆舞蹈起來，隨着鼓鈸聲疾徐進退。半小時以後，換上十三個穿龍袍，左手執人頭壳，右手拿哈達七首的　，下來繞埸舞蹈，久之鑼漸停舞者進殿。</p>
<p>忽然埸中秩序大亂，一般窮苦的看客，都奔到饝　塊下搶奪饝饝，不上數分鐘，饝饝堆被土人搬空了。這是寺中佈施窮人的一幕。</p>
<p>秩序恢復以後，埸中重又堆起幾十担新饝，鼓鈸聲又作，十七個Gikuja牛頭馬面出殿舞蹈。鼓聲緊了一陣，又一個面目猙獰背上挿着旗的Lamsli下來參加。接着一個鹿頭的Sha如旋風般的奔跳而來。</p>
<p>我們準備明天回西寗，所以就此不終埸而辭去，但是他們的社伏不久也告終了。</p>

<h3>上海之證券業（五）</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編　（上海工商業概況之十七）</p>
<p>小公司之過去與現在　經紀人之概况。已詳列於上。此外附庸於經紀人之小公司組。亦有申述之必耍。茲分誌於决。</p>
<p>從事於小公司者。類皆經紀人之代理人輩。熟悉市態。消息靈通。其與客戶交接之手段。有時且勝於經紀人。蓋其範圍較小。自易週全也。故經營者之向小公司投做交易者。三年以來，日甚一日。於是小公司之興起。遂如雨後春笋。蓬蓬勃勃。聞隸屬於華商證券交易所之八十家經紀人中。其附設之小公司。在全盛之時。竟逾一百三十八家。降至今日。漸形蕭沉。其資本數字，自五千元至五萬元不等，其經營方法。專接客戶交易，轉向經紀人請求承做。中間酌收佣金二厘或三厘左右。而小公司之規模較巨者。前有義豐。大同·明昌·一豐·巽泰·等，但在新貨幣政策施行時·已陸續收歇·今年以來·因受新債影響·營業突淸·其仍照常支持者·有晋康·聯豐·中交·恒德·衍康·萃華·叫益·大華·恒泰·和順豐·昌大·泰源·華康·華新·瑞與·立豐·大禮裕·樹德·同益·成興·正昶·恒一·恒利·伯與·永興·同裕·晋德·同亨源·寳興·永興·通裕·聯合·華興·怡泰·五興·元康·源源恒記·裕豐·天發·公利·恒源·公茂·源康·源濟·德豐·瑞成·新豐·緒豐·華豐·叫生·同潤·五豐·義成·達記·恒益·榮昌·同昌·瑞源·永萬達·聚興·永安·怡慎·新生·新康·益成·同源·和康·衍巽·大隆·周迪記·等一百餘家·</p>
<p>三、近年來之上海債券市况　　最近三年上海內國債券之交割數各種債券交割數字之消長·足爲市場盛衰之反映。蓋即投機盤套者，最後亦必須經過交割之手續。始能吿一段落。査民國二十二，二十三，二十四三年度之交割狀况。以二十四年份之十二月期最爲旺盛。而以二十二年度之二月期最爲稀少。三年中之全部收解。（連同本年一月份止）共計十三萬七千七百五十萬元。以平均市價五十元計算。折合國幣達六萬八千八百七十五萬元。而塲外交割者。猶不在內。數額之大。誠足驚人。茲將最近三年中之交割數及成交總額。列表於後。（單位千元）</p>
<p>二十四年度上海之債券市塲，過去一年中，各種內債市價升降之程度。以施行新貨幣時最爲俏利。而以通貨膨脹盛傳時最爲低落，其日期與折扣。似宜有檢討之必要。惟庫券市價之升降。因其剩餘本金逐月减低。故其價格數字。不能直接作爲標凖。故此下表所列。均以折扣比較。茲統計於後。（以上海華商證券交易所期貨之拍板爲限）</p>
<p>證券業之將來，過去證券業之演進，旣　之地大物博，工商力量，蘊藏之富，他日國人蓬蓬勃勃。盛極一時。然則未來之趨勢，將如自營各公司之股票，債票等交易，必能佔一種貴開拍以來，因政府及人民之怒力，市價。趨重要之位置，證券業之前途。方興未艾也。穩定，雖每日成交數額，亦漸轉　，然以我國</p>

<p>上半時中華勝兩分</p>
<p>美將卡遜、幾度探籃、均未得手、久之、始得兩分、旋美軍　更戰略、改為各個監視、華軍裹足難前、蔡演雄罰獲一分、萊因罰擲得三分、勃雷士繼之中的、成七對七半手、敵燄器張、</p>
<p>中華度暫停後、孫寳慶罰得一分、蔡演雄擲中一球、萊因暗伺籃下、失去一球、許文奎罰中兩球、勃雷士萊因急起直追、十二對十二、再度造成平手、文奎連連中的、萊因偷製陰平、十八對十六上半時結束、中華勝兩分、</p>

<p>乙組菲律賓俄國爭奪冠軍、二隊各擁堅甲利兵、演來精彩非凡、開始接觸、菲隊古栢羅將士身手、活躍連進兩球、俄軍一時失色、揭力挽回扳成和局、此時全場空氣緊張、雙方僥勇善戰、上半時成十二與十之經、俄軍佔先、下半時菲隊全軍用命、聲勢為之一震、惟好景不常、俄軍兵壓敵境、重重包圍、史蒂金大獻身手、加羅基夫重露鋒芒、菲軍江河日下、前鋒諸將、重重受刑、不得一逞、俄軍分數扶搖直上、成三十二比二十、奪得錦標、</p>
<h3>甲組足球賽　東華挫蘭開夏</h3>
<p>東華合作純熟以三對二吿勝　今日出戰法商勁敵當待努力</p>
<p>西聯足球會甲組聯賽、東華會對蘭開夏、昨日下午三時三刻在逸園繼優游對蘭開夏之初級盃賽而戰、作壁上觀者約二千餘人、前半時東華在全軍純熟之合作下、以二對一佔先、後半時蘭軍行動漸趨粗魯、動轍踢人、幾至不歡而散、幸東華退讓、未釀成禍、乃各進一球、總結果為三對二東華勝蘭開夏、東華會今日出戰法商會、如能獲勝、於錦標大有希望、然法商會實力堅强、東華得勝、殊為不易也、雙方陣綫如下、</p>
<p>首開紀錄</p>
<p>三時三刻球證何春輝吹動胡笳、雙方即佈陣角逐、蘭軍頓度脚下撥動阿斗、輸送前敵、顧尚勷施下解數、攔路截下、戴中軍旁敲側擊、得球直闖、幼良左右相輔、直逼敵營、衝至腹地、戴麟經暗放强弩、敵陣立陷、首開紀錄、張金海不甘落人之後、邊疆起義、轉傳陳德輝、三盤五傳、已盤至蘭軍腹地、陳乃舉脚力射、別立琪梅臥地撲救、接而復失、又吿失守、敵軍陣地時遭我軍蹂躪、碧眼兒個個忿火中燒、奮臂躍起、透納進兵犯境、頓度後軍接應、凡理萊兵伏邊陲、得球由底綫處力射、陸鐘恩一時失措、球由左角直綱心、扳回一球、自後雙方熙熙攘攘、各無建樹、上半時結束、東華以二對一佔先、</p>
<p>東華勝利</p>
<p>易地再戰、蘭開夏努力反攻、備荘一脚遠送、頓度向前飛奔、得球便射、睦大哥拉起長脚、輕輕跌出、東華逞勢撲敵、張金海陳德輝孫錦順相繼叩門、均未命中、旋番將巴頓得霍華特之協助、射中一球、成二對二平手、賈幼良右路起兵、一脚中傳、麟經候個正着、於十二碼處、建功班師、敵軍眼看失利、怒從心頭起、舉兵來犯、時在東華門前興風作浪、幸李關防衛得宜、未失寸土、此後東華數叩敵門、亦未得逞、未幾銀笛長鳴、東華以三比二勝利、今日遇法商會、戰於逸園、是賽為東華欲圖覇權之緊要關鍵、</p>
<h3>今日甲組足球　東華戰常勝軍法商</h3>
<p>下午三時三刻在逸園　甲組錦標之緊要關鍵　葡萄牙棄權優游不勞而勝</p>
<p>西聯足球甲組聯賽、經昨日優游二比二和蘇谷爾後、法商乃成為果碩僅存之常勝軍、該隊八戰八勝、對於鏥標前途、似極光明、然法商界一不敗之隊乎、此言恐未必盡言、逆料今日東華可以勝之、誠如是、則東華前途、亦有其光明之希望在焉、否則甲組錦標、恐非國人球隊所得染指之矣、</p>
<p>西聯足球甲組賽優游對葡萄牙本定今日在申園交鋒、現葡隊因故不克成軍應戰、自行放棄、該賽取消、優游乃不勞而獲勝利、優游乙對英　軍之組賽、則仍於下行二時在申園作戰云、</p>
<p>昨日結果</p>
<p>昨日甲組除東華三比二勝蘭開夏、優游二比二和蘇壳爾外、其餘三塲純西人隊、法商以十一比一之大比數擊敗猶太、猶太固弱、此法商勝球之多、其實力之强勁、不言而喩、　克斯以五比二勝上週以九比三克葡萄牙之西捕、其實力亦有顯著之長進、另一場為葡萄牙以四比三挫西商、甲組最近成績如下、</p>
<p>甲組形勢</p>
<h3>香港甲組足球　南華兄弟俱敗</h3>
<p>中華三比一勝海軍</p>
<p>（香港十四日專電）十四日尋常杯中華以三比一勝海軍、三球俱為張滿榮射入、南華南及南華華各以三球分別敗於九龍會及蘭開夏隊、南華南是日好手未出場、留待十五日爭奪特別銀牌冠軍、其改固意中事、南華華之敗、則出入意表、</p>
<h3>力挫蘭開夏　優游獲初級盃</h3>
<p>蘭軍聲勢浩大上半時二比一佔先　優游合力進攻以四比三反敗為勝</p>
<p>西聯足球會初級盃决賽、優游會對蘭開夏、昨日下午二時在逸園足球場交鋒、雙方實力平衡、戰來勢均力敵、上半時優游被敵軍監住甚嚴、未能得逞、以二對一見挫、下半時優游抱破釜沉舟决心、反攻甚烈、會打成各二平局、卒賴合力進攻、以三對一於頺勢中反敗為勝、總結果四對三優游淘汰蘭開夏、榮膺初級盃、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<p>桑雪斯　首開紀錄</p>
<p>時間旣屆、即開始肉搏、優游首取攻勢、許文奎將球挑送、前敵吉利生趕上、半途截下、敵將鼻勞特斯邊陲犯境、三傳五遞、闖過我軍駐綫、運至相當地域、轉遞左路桑雪斯、不慌不忙、從容命中、記錄首開、優游失利、全軍奪發、七生中路崛起、惠培得球衝至敵軍腹　、惜大貓脚頭兒準、未能得手、巧生捲土重來、逼成角球、斗文開來、恰到好處、文奎枕戈以待、湊之以頭、稍偏中門柱彈回、坐失良機、</p>
<p>奚巧生　扳回一球</p>
<p>文奎中路興兵、率領諸將、浩浩蕩蕩、殺向敵軍、連盤帶衝、瞞過三關、施放强弩、直中垓心、惜越位作廢、蘭軍危局已過、衝殺甚烈、球由張容從內傳出、霍浮斯擋住、拔腿飛射、又告中的、以二對〇遙遙佔先、優游陣地頻失、全軍怒髮衝冠、力謀雪恥、番將技術犯規、由張容主罰、奚巧生截得來球、興兵侵犯、居然不負衆望、在十五碼處叩門、一舉成功、扳回一球、未幾時間告終、蘭軍以二對一佔先、</p>
<p>許文奎　再度建功</p>
<p>檸檬過後、易地再戰、優游抱連戰之志、反攻甚熾、小孟　右路運兵、羅斗文頭頂未着、殊為可惜、文奎再接再勵、惠培又因頭頂過高越門而過、程貽澤東山再起、權作識塗老馬、得球前導、球在敵門前盤旋、斗文兩度失機、敵軍未失寸土、惠培駕輕就熟、重入敵營、敵內衝力阻、逼成角球、惠培開來、恰到好處、文奎斜里竄出、射球入綱、造成和局、中綫處開球後、球又被優游攔住、斗文運至相當地域力射、又中綱心、兩球之人僅一分鐘耳、</p>
<p>優游榮　獲初級盃</p>
<p>優游至此、氣燄萬丈、奚巧生揭旗運兵、羅斗文前策後應、孫惠培埋伏左路、迎個正着、臥地掃射、掰納接而復失、貽澤見機奔上、坐獲漁利、蘭軍乃作困獸之職、前鋒直逼而來、沿途勢如破竹、麥廷琳救球心切、手悮綱球、判罰十二碼、衝克遜罰入成四對三、時不我待、胡笳長鳴、息戈收軍、優游淘汰蘭開夏榮獲初級盃、由西聯會當場給盃、優游由奚巧生代表授盃、乃三呼而散、按　盃上屆為東華會所得云、</p>
<h3>優游和蘇壳爾</h3>
<p>優游隊前鋒銳利無奈良機頻失　蘇壳爾球運殊佳二對二成和局</p>
<p>西聯甲組足球賽優游對蘇壳爾昨日角逐於申園球塲、按蘇壳爾於甲組中、原甚平庸、優游則實力雄厚、預料當不難取勝、然事出意外、竟以二對二戰成和局、昨審優游起始前鋒銳利、氣燄萬丈、而蘇壳爾球運殊佳、兩次追成和局、至最後數分鐘、優游屢度猛攻、仍不能得手、殆亦運　、茲將昨賽詳情分誌如后、</p>
<p>氣燄萬丈</p>
<p>三時三刻開始　戰、優游開球、左路進攻、雲逢　鐘勇森長傳短遞、直逼敵營、小鐘舉足力蹴、敵門機警、求出險球、俄軍反攻、鎭祥踢成角球、優游再度圍攻、俄軍陣前、險象　生、未幾、勇森單騎直入、蘇壳爾後衛空虛、小鐘如入無人之境、鮑維區不免慌張、球入綱內、優游佔先、俄軍開球、頃刻即為優游刦下、奈良機頻失、蘇壳爾乘勢反攻、樹棠阻成角球、齊倫斯基主開、落點恰到好處、鮑倫寗輕輕一撥、張榮才措手不及、竟吿失守、一對一秋色平分、數度往返、上半時吿終、</p>
<p>竟成和局</p>
<p>易地再戰、鎭和一馬當先、右傳王世華、趕之不及、失去良機、薛雍源遠射、擦過橫木、未能命中、優游再接再厲、俄軍備受蹂躪、俄而鎭和叩門、敵門揮臂拍出、勇森候個正着、順水推舟、球已入綱、優游再度超　、俄軍努力反攻、無奈優游後衛森嚴、蘇壳爾不得逞志、鎭和再起義兵、有如饑虎撲羊、敵門以柔相克、臥地救出、優游　衰、俄軍猛烈進攻、一剎那間、已至腹地、　偷寧力射、恰中紅心、一對二又成和局、優游諸將、忿火中燒、園攻俄軍、無奈優游球運欠佳、終未得手、和局而散、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（二〇〇）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M　Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>第三幕是那公子傳令官來，試這個鞋子，坦第仍舊穿着者御的衣服，上臺來吹一個錫製的「角」，頗足動聽。那一對驕傲的姊妹們每個都要試試那隻鞋子南恩一定要表演用小刀削去足趾的一節，做得那麽當真，竟使傳令官嚇一大跳，求她要「掀子希」。（註十）旣經個個都不成，於是傳着灰娘，她披上一半的圍裙進來了，將她的足一溜進那隻鞋　，歡欣地宣布道：「我就是那個都娘。」（註十一）</p>
<p>小梅笑了，求她姊姊的恕宥；可是南恩素來愛好悲劇的情味。比原故事再進一步，扮着在地下昏厥了過去，卻是舒舒服服　在那裏飽看本劇未完的一段。這一段卻亦不長，因為那王孫公子跑了進來，跪在地上，吻着金　兒的手顯出濃厚的熱情，同時那傳令官司大吹其號了，蔑乎使看客們震耳欲聾了。那個幕也沒有機會再降下，因為灰娘從台上直跑到她父親那裏，喊道：「我不做得好嗎？」而王孫公子和傳　官，卻就用了那錫「角」和木劍比了一回的武。</p>
<p>個個人養着「這是美妙的！」等到狂歡稍稍平了一點，乃德携着一個提琴出來了。</p>
<p>（註十）很仔細</p>

<h3>糧食　投機轉向粉麥　遠期飛漲近期尙平</h3>
<p>自　余公債　失其投機性後、吾人早知其將集中於紗花粉麥、固焉自歐局變動、日人踴　、金融業及投機大戶先向紗花進攻、繼向粉麥揚廠、資金之出路、總在投機市場，儘說發展工商、宥何用處、</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、近期尚平、遠期自六月份起、一致呈飛皇騰達之象、查漲風之由來、因業外如證券紗花等帮、以歐洲事變之後、多數集中力量、大量購買、如以近期為比例、則此種漲度、純為投機所激動、故開價後、三四月份、交易雖暢、價無波動、一至六月份開始、賣戶之暢、得未曾有、六月份自三元零八分、即步步上漲、七八月份、亦具同樣之漲度、較前日計漲三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、近期仍少上落、惟拍至八月份、證券金子等帮、又出而猛進、較上午即暗提二三分、入後進戶仍暢旺異常、但大廠方面、亦有大量套售，故自三盤以後、漲風即逐步回鬆、照目下情形、如業外之買風不息、後步仍有激動之慮、全日成交、許達一百四十萬包左云、</p>
<p>期麥上午開盤、各月份市面、初曾平靜、因洋麥祗好一角左右、天時亦已晴暖、買戶似有停止之勢、但目下之之買戶、已不復根據事賣、純以國際形態為轉移、且大量買戶、均屬無關之外行、初以業外不動、故價不動、旋以證券紗花帮不限價購進、市氣遂呈昂漲、迨至下午開盤、上午之餘風不絕、又兼粉市之猛抬、交易大暢、市面亦步步激漲、七八月份計達一角一二分、幸產區客戶、反有套賣、市面稍平落、惟將來如洋麥不再續定、外行之勢力、仍難忽視耳、現麥貨主以期粉麥飛騰不已、亦欲喊高五分、但廠戶均觀望不動云、</p>
<p>海外小麥市况。因西南有大風沙、惟聞早區範圍較去年為小、因歐洲消息與種種謠言關係、價格變動或將比前為大、</p>
<h3>客秈方患過剩　洋米有欲採辦</h3>
<p>客秈續有長江各埠裝到、尤以江西較多、蓋目滬市飛漲以後、各埠均聞風運串、奈實銷始終不及囤戶之旺、而囤戶進胃雖多、終非實際去路、今囤胃呆而求脫、市仍立即一蹶不振矣、統市祗有本街辦去江西米七十包、溫台米一百二十四包、總計不到二百包、價乃立見狂落一角半至二角不等、</p>
<p>洋米運日市形甚俏、今以客秈連連回落、行囤不敢再為擯持、昨開暹羅米彔几元八角、價已回小二角、又開茄辣地機米一百包、小級一千三百包、價亦跟落、期貨三四月份暹羅米彔昨有行囤回範九百五十噸、價亦小去五分及八分云、</p>
<p>寧波方面以新米上市時行　過賤、搬運出外、近則又患缺米、市上盛傳有請撥欵三百萬、洋米護照五十萬包以便採辦洋米接濟之、說而本市連日到米甚旺、苦於無出路、調節不靈、於此可知、</p>
<h3>食米市况續見疲軟</h3>
<p>價跌三四角不等</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍湧、共到八十餘號、（貨共萬七千餘石、）是以市况續疲、厚早粳價再跌三四角不等、薄稻包胃、雖尙有靑島威海衛等帮動辦四千餘包、然以前朝剩貨既多、人心未免稍餒、故結果高者續降角七分、中次削三角、杜洋尖亦繼跌三尺、陰元同狀、</p>
<p>(滬北）昨日河下各帮、到船五六十號、市上去胃呆滯、白粳價跌三四角、陰元跌小二三角、變元小角外、早稻小三角、薄稻小二角零、羊杜埠秈等均短二角外、客尖短一角、其餘亦見疲小、</p>
<h3>標準油餅繼續升騰</h3>
<p>現貨買戶轉形觀望</p>
<p>標準油豆餅各市繼續沸騰、良以自歐局緊張以後、業外投機即紛紛追求於糧粉兩交易所、兼以餅銷加旺、現豆求過於供更使市、面上升、過日大連來電以再升漲後、尤使業外投機之加度興當、昨日晨間聞價時、各檔已見飛升、繼以連電近期報漲、買氣愈旺、午後各盤　見上升、收市價標餅漲二三分、標豆漲一角二三分、標油漲三四五角不等、</p>
<p>洋莊芝蔴呆擯日久、迫至前日由怡和洋行辦去一百噸、訂三月份交貨、價為十一元一角、比較上月之最低價漲起四角、出於油價暴長之故、但前途銷場能否繼續、尙難捉摸、油豆餅市價勢居有漲無跌之局、然賣方一味緊扳、價格日趨奔騰、致買戶反缺、故昨市交易不若上日熱鬧、大勢已成擯持局面、</p>
<h3>紗花　存紗减少　標紗空頭大起恐慌</h3>
<p>午後開盤發現高峯收盤市價轉見狂跌</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、且漲風異常銳利、蓋以通來現紗銷路發達、致存紗抽空不少、本月份交割時期接近、空方籌碼缺乏、多方對於倉庫之存紗、業已移動、於是空頭大起惶恐、近期跳勢愈烈、午後開盤六·七·八三個月發現高峯、收盤獲利了結、市判乃狂跌、惟現紗模子則奇緊云、</p>
<p>標紗初漲後跌</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月仍無進展、以海外棉市平庸、且賣方又來壓迫、微跌四·五·角、二盤平平、拍至三收判、遠期三個月猛跳二元外、因某方面又來大量拖進、而現紗售價狂漲三元、各廠因原料昂貴、對於棉紗不願輕易脫售、於是浮空恐慌、買氣尤激、市價乃奔騰、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元二·四·六·八角、午後開盤、近月氣勢較緊、賣方又現倉皇之象、二判步步上騰、六月期穿出二百十元關外、詎料收盤時多頭吐出、市盤反動驟起、賣方壓迫益烈、但現紗根子奇緊、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌九角至一元一·六·角、惟本月漲四角、查賣出通記二千二百五十包、達記三千七百五十包、　豊二千三百包、益昶一千四百五十包、生源九百五十包、森康一千五包五十包、信誠二千六百包、買進德大二千三百包、同孚一千四百五十包、明德二千三百五十包、合興七百五十包、慎記一千四百包、大昌成二千二百包、泰昌一千零五十包、潤康四千九百包、仁豊一千五百包、頤大一千包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗飛漲三元</p>
<p>現紗銷路尙暢、查全日各帮買去統計二千〇四十二包、售價飛漲三元、綫漲四元、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>多頭獲利出籠　棉花同業傾向拋售</h3>
<p>棉市局勢較平、因連朝狂漲、引起獲利多頭吐出、市氣略軟、後以紗市飛漲、棉市帶起、但金融界對於棉市看漲心思劇烈、惟一般同業傾向拋售、雙方之競爭愈烈也、</p>
<p>標花近堅遠疲</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉跌三至十一磅音、印棉漲跌互見、上下〇·二五至〇·五七羅比、大阪三品花跌二·三角、三盤以紗市狂昇、本月份穿出四元外、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲五分至三角半、午後開盤、局勢仍平、一般同業傾向拋賣、市傳又有印棉定開、但銀行界仍拖進、迨至三收盤多頭出籠、市盤大跌、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二·三·四角、查賣出大孚三千担、澄記一千四百担、通記四千六百、達記九千二百担、明德一千六百担振大二千五百担、合興七千七百担、同豊八千三百担、仁豊三千七百担、益昶六千三百担、信誠六千三百担、長和三千八百担、買進德大三千四百担、恒益二千担、大豊三千二百担、賡豊二千八百担、慎昌五千八百擔、大昌成九千二百擔、長豊一萬一千七百擔、潤康五千擔、生源五千五百擔、益康六千三百擔、元一三千擔、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現棉銷路尙佳</p>
<p>現棉走銷尙好、廠胃不斷、來源謠花二八包云、</p>
<h3>美棉初堅後跌</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤，同業觀望、各月由不動至漲二磅音、最初同業限價買進、　棉處未售三月期、市况堅定、其後有買進　棉兩套出期棉、多頭了結、外商賣出、逐步疲弱、海斯德估計本週廠用為二六一、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底為三八二·〇〇〇包、收盤平疲、計現貨跌八磅音、期貨跌三至十一磅音、英棉現貨不動、期貨跌一二點、印棉歐洲出口商賣出、多頭了結、日商買進為期貨上賣出所抵銷、計平果兩漲〇·二五至〇·七五羅比、奧姆　跌〇·五至〇·七五羅比、白羅溪跌〇·七五至一羅比、原電錄左、（十三日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十四日白羅溪花之開盤預測、為一百九十四羅比、較上日收盤跌一·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花俱平</h3>

<h3>童子軍的眞義是什麽？</h3>
<p>— 陳世聰</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們爲什麼要組織童子軍？我們組織童子軍，是不是呌我們穿着美麗的制服；拿着長長的圓棍。吹着悅耳的喇叭；敲着很有節奏的鼓，挺着胸；凸着肚，耀武揚威地做給旁人看的嗎？不，不是！</p>
<p>那末，童子軍的眞義究竟是什麼呢？童子軍就是一個喜歡野外生活，注重常識訓練，平均發展德智體羣美五育的兒童；在國家具有民族精神，政治知識，生產能力的未來好公民，也就是社會中被壓迫民衆的救星，實現世界和平的同情者。「智仁勇一和「準備」是它的信條，養成兒童自動的天性，鼓勵兒童的自主與自治的能力是它的宗旨。</p>
<p>小朋友！今天是童子軍節日。願你們都加入童子軍。並且要牢牢地記着童子軍的眞義，而一一實行起來。</p>
<h3>中國童子軍四烈士</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>小朋友！你們知道四烈士慘痛的故事嗎？我來吿訴你，他們是上海市商會童子軍團的四位勇士——羅雲祥，應文達，鮑正武，毛徵祥。</p>
<p>當一二八戰禍，散佈了整個的上海，敵人的大砲聲，不斷地轟轟響着，將熱鬧的閘北，快耍燬滅了！那逃不出來的同胞，還在號哭連天的呼救着；啊！這是何等悽慘的事呀！他們所最重要的救護工作，也在此刻成立，各人宣了「爲國效忠，救難拯危，一切犧牲，在所不顧」的誓言，在團長指揮下，就全體出動，一隊隊的高舉着紅十字會旗幟，向閘北開始服務。</p>
<p>三十一號的早上，他們四人，也給團長派了出去，直到傍晚，未見回來，竟在不明不白中，被害了！至今四烈士的枯骨，還不知在什麼地方哩？後來地方人士，就造了一個四烈士衣冠墓，以紀念這忠勇的童子軍四烈士。全中國，全世界的童子軍都表示莫大的哀悼。在瘦秋</p>
<h3>童子軍博愛歌</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>中國童子軍總會副會長，考試院院長戴季陶，曾替童子軍編了一闋博愛歌，歌詞很是壯烈，現在，特地錄給小朋友們看看：</p>
<p>童子軍！童子軍！愛我的身；愛我的家；愛我的國；愛我的人羣；童子軍！童子軍！愛我的身，努力做完人，有智；有仁；有勇；不負好靑春。童子軍！童子軍！愛我的家，父母生我身，至德，要道，莫看輕。要報父母恩。童子軍！童子軍！愛我的國，爲國作犧牲！救國大道，民族；民權；與民生；赤血丹心，靑天白日放光明，自由平等。要爲國家爭！童子軍！童子軍！愛我人羣，捨已助他人，有禮。，有義；同德；同心；日行一善，行善在至誠。必忠；必信；大地盡皆春。童子軍！童子軍！愛我的身；愛我的家；愛我的國；愛我的人羣。</p>
<h3>童子軍的小史</h3>
<p>— 蕭恩訜</p>
<p>「童子軍」，是世界上模仿軍事訓練的一種兒童集團組織，所以就呌做「童子軍」。這是我們大家所曉得的。但是這種組織很是普徧，世界上無論那一國，都有，到底有什麼好處呢？「童子軍」的好處正多着，現在就拿「品性」方面來說吧；這種組織可以使兒童過着合羣的生活，並有紀律化，有團結力，有勇敢精神，有勤樸美德，拿「工作」方面來說吧；可以使兒童養成服務社會的習慣，並且有奮鬥能力，有强健體魄，有義勇觀戚，有堅毅意志。故他的好處，不但在敦品立行，服務社會；而且可使兒童從小鍜練，造成國家强盛的基礎哩！你說偉大不偉大！</p>
<p>然而「童子軍」的歷史是怎樣呢？是誰創始的呢？現在我就把這個「童子軍」的小史，講給諸位小朋友聽吧！</p>
<p>且說當公元一八九九年，英國和南非洲戰爭爆發的時候，那時英國出發的軍隊中，有一位很勇敢聰朋的軍人，他的名字呌做貝敦堡。他在軍隊中，雖然風餐露宿，過着艱苦的生活，但是他的博學好思的精神，却繼續不斷的抖擻着。他在軍隊中數年，無論什麼事，都要拿來做研究材料的。有一天，他想到英國的軍隊，和南非洲戰爭，雖佔優勢；可是英國入民平日大都耽於逸樂，不耐勞苦，軍人中亦未免沾染此種習氣，殊非所宜。於是他就想組織「童子軍」，把兒童依照軍事方式，訓練起來，養成他的强健體格，勞苦精神。無奈他軍役倥惚，那裏有功夫進行呢？所以遲至一九零七年，才召集了兒童，在一個僻靜的島嶼中訓練起來，方纔實現了他的願望。這就是「童子軍」創始的經過。但是人家終不知道他用意所在，等到决年，他出版了一本著作，呌做「童子電的警衛一，於是世人方憬悟「童子軍」事業，對於社會國家有這樣偉大的貢獻。所以風聲所播，世界各國莫不競相舉辦，而「童子軍」的組織，也就普徧于全世界了。</p>
<h3>寒暑表</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>每天放學回家，敏兒的看報是少不了的，所以他對於國家大事都能熟悉明瞭，而他看到了天文台報吿的氣候，就很疑惑的問着他的哥哥聰兒；</p>
<p>「哥哥，報上說昨天是二十度，照理是很冷了，但是昨天並不見得怎樣的冷，這是什麼邇理，」</p>
<p>「弄錯了，你　到了華氏寒暑表，但是天文台上所報吿的却是攝氏寒暑表上的溫度。」</p>
<p>「到底華氏寒暑表和攝氏寒暑表有什麼不同？」</p>
<p>「華氏寒暑表的泳點是三十二度，沸點是二百十二度，這兩點間的距離等分成一百八十份，而攝氏寒暑表的冰點是零度，沸點是一百度，這兩點間的距離等分成一百份，所以華氏表上的一度等於攝氏表上的九分之五度。」</p>
<p>「寒暑表是怎樣做的？我們能不能自已來做一隻？」</p>
<p>「寒暑表是一支很細而很均匀的玻璃管，使管的一端吹成抱狀，在泡和管的一部份盛滿了水銀，但也有放酒精的。當水銀或酒精受到熱，便膨脹，那麼管中的水銀有一部份從管中鋪出來，在這時候把管口封閉，不使空氣進去，水銀便能自由伸降，不受空氣的壓力。講到自己做的話，倒很困難，爲什麼呢？因爲這精密而正確的玻璃管，我想在中國是難以造成的。」</p>
<p>「他們怎能在寒暑表的玻璃管上刻劃度數？」</p>
<p>「把寒暑表的泡部浸在正在融化的冰裏，見管中的水銀錢端降到一處而停留，便把綫端的位置刻劃在管壁，這位置就是我們普通所稱的冰點。再把寒暑表的泡部浸在沸水的蒸汽中，看見水銀錢端昇到一處而停留，把綫端的位置刻在管壁，這就呌沸點。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，水銀做的寒暑表好呢？還是火酒做的寒暑表來得好？」</p>
<p>「水銀寒暑表和酒精寒暑表，各有它們的好處，但也難免各有它們的短處，因為水銀能受到很高的熱度，大約攝氏三百度左右，但到攝氏三十九度以下，便到凝結，就失去了作用。而酒精不能受高的熱度，大的到攝氏七十八度以上，便化爲蒸汽，但它在攝氏零度下一百三十度也不會　結，所以水銀寒暑表大都用在溫帶和熱帶，酒精寒暑表都用在寒帶最爲適宜。」</p>

<h3>年少不努力老大徒傷悲</h3>
<p>— 錢克昌</p>
<h3>會飛的燈</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>小朋友我來告訴你們做一個會飛的燈吧。</p>
<p>「嘿！燈會飛嗎？」也許你們會這樣的驚疑。</p>
<p>但是，我决不會騙你們的：燈不但會飛，並且飛得很高很高，在天空裏，橡一顆明星。</p>
<p>並且在冷的天，做飛燈是非常適宜的。因爲這個飛燈需用到火的，又需要在雪夜放的；在材料方面，又用不到一些凍手的（如水等）東西。所以，在冷天做這種玩意，一定能得到你們的快意。</p>
<p>第一步：請你們找一根三尺長的薄篾片，紮圓圈，中間繫一根細鉛絲做直徑，如圖一</p>
<p>第二步：請買一張紙，紅綠色都可。將紙對折成一圓筒，口的大小，要和篾團相等，將旁面及上頂糊密，不使張開，再糊到的篾圈上，成口袋狀如圖二。</p>
<p>第三步：請你找一塊棉絮繫在密口的直徑鉛絲上，飛燈全部卽告成了，如圖</p>
<p>放時，宜在黑夜的屋外，先將棉絮上蘸些煤油，一人端正飛燈，一人燃火，棉絮着火，燈內的空氣都給火燒跑了，所以體質就輕了。這時人，就輕輕放手，燈卽漸漸上升，一直升到高空，看了實在有趣。有兩伴事要注意：</p>
<p>有風的晚上不能放，不但放不上去，且有燒去的危險。</p>
<p>有草棚的所在不能放，以防火警。</p>
<h3>褪色藥水</h3>
<p>— 三民</p>
<p>小朋友，你們戚到討厭嗎？當你們寫錯了字——不是鉛筆字而是鋼筆寫的，塗墨團嗎？太難看。拋去重新寫吧；太可惜，旣費時間又耗精力，現在有一個辦法能够將字跡滅去。這是一種化學水溶液，它的製法很便利，略述於後：</p>
<p>材料：過錳酸鉀；稀硫酸；草酸；水</p>
<p>用具　有塞之玻瓶二隻，杯子一。</p>
<p>製法　先將水溶於適量之草酸，使它很稀，倒在一玻瓶中。更將過錳酸鉀用於溶化，成紫色溶液，再倒少許稀硫酸子其中，傾入另一玻瓶中，這樣工作就算成功了。</p>
<p>用法　用玻棒（因爲鐵的或銅的，會和硫酸起作用。）蘸一些紫溶液塗在寫錯的字上，字跡就會滅去。再將另一瓶草酸，也塗一些，那末紙上一點汚跡也沒有了。</p>
<p>原因　因為，過錳酸鉀和硫酸生成硫酸錳和發生機養，發生機養和墨水起作用，生成白色的有機物。同時硫酸錳又是白的，所以能使字跡滅去。（又草酸有時可以不需要，因爲他僅防有汚跡）</p>

<h3>我的學校</h3>
<p>— 李小岑</p>
<p>我的學校，在一個風景秀麗，而空氣新鮮的所在，兩旁都種着高大的樹和美麗的你花，地上還鋪著靑靑的草。學校的後面，有一條河：那河水碧綠可愛，幽靜無比。河中有許多小魚，游來遊去，很是活潑。河旁還有幾株楊柳，影兒倒映在水裹，怪可愛的。再講到我們學校的內部，現在已換了很多新的敎師，和新的同學。各位教師，都盡他們的力來敎我們。同學們也是個個相親相愛，沒有一個不懂禮貌的。我們學校的房子，也大大的改變，敎室內都是十分地淸潔整齊，並且牆壁上貼着很多新的畫報，這是爲着要增進我們的智識和學問起見而設備的。隔學校不遠，還有校園，球塲，運動塲，什麼都很齊備。我們的學校，眞是多麼可愛呀！</p>

<h3>冷天玻璃杯怎易炸裂？</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>通常盛茶的一種玻璃杯，在夏天應用毫無問題，豈知一到冬天可就不然，時常把好好的玻璃杯炸裂開來，這是什麼道理呢？</p>
<p>小朋友大概還不會忘記先生在自然課上講過熱漲冷縮的道理吧。須知玻璃杯也要熟漲冷縮的，不過人眼不會看得出罷了。因爲冬天很冷，玻璃杯縮得很小，若忽然倒下熱水去，玻璃杯裏面受熱，就馬上漲大，可是外面因天氣過冷而不漲，這樣，一面要漲，一面不漲，於是就把玻璃杯擠裂了。現在反轉來講，在熱天玻璃杯爲什麼不炸裂？這因爲熱天天氣的熱度與熱水的熱度，相差的程度比冬天小得多，所以雖然裏面要漲，外面不漲，可是它們的分別很小，自然不致炸裂了。所以我們明白了這種道理，在冬天天冷時，要杯子不炸，那只有把杯子先用溫水弄熟，再冲熱茶。因玻璃杯經溫水弄熱後，裏面已經先漲了相當的程度，如再冲熱茶，就不致爲冷熱差度太大而炸裂了。</p>
<h3>義狗傳（十一）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>曾有好幾决老達士在他的床上向小南洛說道：「南洛，你長大起來，要是能保守這一所屋子和這一小塊田地，自食其力，好好地工作着。給你的鄰人們喚你一聲田主，那麼，我雖長眠地下，也很滿意的了。』</p>
<p>在一個普通的農人的意想中：一倘人只要能够住自己的屋子，種自己的田，吃自己的麵包，道就是最高的目標了。老達士在少年時流轉四方，却仍空手回來，所以到了老年，只希望悄悄地在一個地方生活，也就死在這個地方，而他對於他那親愛的孫兒，也就希望他這樣就算了。</p>
<p>但是小南洛却不説甚麽，他所夢想的却並不在種那一小塊的田，住在那一小宅的屋子裏，也並不想聽鄰人們叫他一聲田主。他的一心一意只是注在那禮拜寺尖頂之下，此外甚麽都不想了。但是他的心事，只吿知他的好友柏德希，每逢天明時，在曉霧中一同出去工作，或回來後一同躺在水邊的蘆葦中休息時，總得凑在那狗的耳邊低低地說着。</p>
<p>除了柏德希之外，小南洛還有一個朋友，能够向他訴說自己的心事的。這位朋友是小愛洛，他住在革阜上的老麼坊中，他的父親就是這磨坊的主人，要算是村中最富的農夫。</p>
<p>小愛洛是一個美麗的孩子，一張溫柔的圓臉，帶着玫瑰之色，一雙漆黑的眼睛，像西班牙人般十分的可愛。</p>
<p>小愛洛是常常同小南洛和柏德希在一起的。他們一同田中玩耍，在雪中奔跑，他們一同採集雛菊花和越橋，他們一同到那灰色的老禮拜堂裏去，他們也常常一同坐在那磨坊中的壁爐旁邊。</p>

<h3>社會敎育與美術陶冶</h3>
<p>— 蔣建白</p>
<p>社會敎育實施的對象，是社會的全民衆，從幼童以至成人，從有形以至無形，從生活的試驗以至生活的實體，從知識的探求以至道德的履行，從個己的單位以至復雜的團體，均是他們的範疇。從他的屬性來講，可分爲德，知，體，情，技的幾方面，這幾方面的原動力又以情育爲主。幾乎至情，則心志齊一，而社會的機構，乃可完滿構成。美術便是構情的表徵，言情的結晶。宇宙的墨跡，山河的姸　，我民族愛美的精神，造成許多豐功偉業。如今更須以眞美的陶冶上至情的表現，來滿足向上的慾望，訓練健全的社會份子，發揚我偉大的民族光榮。</p>
<p>人類的求知和愛美是同樣的與生俱來之天性，美可以使人類感覺到興趣與愉快，在興趣和愉快的節奏中，整個的品性就陶冶融洽了。可知美術爲實施社會敎育的工具，人類於社會生活中。必然的感覺煩悶和乾燥乏味，要調劑這煩悶乾燥，惟有求精神上的安慰，而美術方面的繪畫，詩歌，雕刻，電影，戲劇等等最足以使人欣賞娛樂。人類接受了這種美的欣賞娛樂之後，不期然而然的潛移默化，興趣濃厚了：於充實智識技能之外，更得了道德的培養，就沒有恣肆狂放之思想，沒有詭詐陰險，猛戾桀傲的手段，誠摯美滿，相牽爲善，社會秩序，漸趨於安寧，國家基礎，也就　固穩定。</p>
<p>社會民衆，旣如此需要美術的陶冶，美術就不能距離民衆太遠，美術除本身的發展以外，還應力謀美術民衆化，普遍化，常常舉行美術展覽會，音樂會等等，增進社會民衆鑑賞美術的智能，使民衆的情操受美術音樂等的感化，而激發志氣，奮起精神。在此民族將歸淪亡的非常期中，不僅在生產的增加，國力的充實，而於民族文化的宣揚，社會道德的培養，尤負重大的使命，美術爲文化的動力，是培養社會道德的工具，民衆訓練旣臻其重要性，則美術的提倡推行當然是更加重要了。</p>
<h3>願與中華美術協會諸同志共勉</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>近年國人對於藝術運動，不爲寂寞。學社學會，雜　如雨後春　。當其建始未嘗不如火如荼，氣蓋今古；曾不幾時，或因精神方面之頹喪，或因物質方面之欠缺，或因其他種種環境之逆來，卒至全體渙散而消滅。前車之鑒實多，後顧之慮逐殷。本協會之組織，不過一二人登高一呼可以完事，然如何能持之久長如何能在此藝術環境中有所作爲有所貢獻，則非一二人所能獨任其難。</p>
<p>任何團體，必須有整個團體的精神始克有整個國體的能力。凡爲團體的一份子，人人能以團體的一切爲目標而盡份子的全力以赴之，則其團體必成爲强有力者。然如何能使團體的各份子養成此種道德，則又非首先負責之少數份子表式於前逐漸提攜感化，自須相當時間，遇此相當時間，整個團體的精神的基礎，於是奠定，則整個團體的能力發展，亦遂宏大。而團體的生命，自然與團體的事業繼長增高於無窮。願與本會諸問志共勉之。</p>
<h3>從本位說起</h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>—爲紀念中華美術協會放生而作—</p>
<p>發起中華美術協會的諸同志，不用說不是美術，就是熱心提倡美術的人。大家看見他所人事的或他所醉心的美術界，像一盤散沙一樣，一天一天的沉淪下去，在不久的將來，或者競將歸於淘汰，怎能不痛心疾首，想法挽救呢？這個中華，美術協會的放生，也許就是諸同志，絞盡腦汁，所開出來的千金必靈方吧？管他靈不靈，好在現在並沒有再高明的方法，也就只好姑且一試了。</p>
<p>海上的所謂　畫會之流，大槪在這條道上混混的人，腦筋中總還留着不少的名目吧？但所遺留給是甚麼？恐怕除了一個不甚引起好感的空名字而外。就是還有些賬目不淸，辦事不公，主持的人視爲御用團體，會員只會講　話，不肯負責任，……類如此等不甚良好的印象吧？但是現在的時代不同了藝術界自身再不努力自救，藝術界就要沉於萬刦不復之地了。現在藝術界有沒有努力自救的能力？有沒有努力自救的决心？那就只好看這「呱呱墜地」的中華美術協會的成績如何而定了！</p>
<p>中華美術協會的好壞，固然是中華美術界的生死關頭，然而我却不是只會喊着叫人家努力，而前綫衝鋒拚命，自己却躱在地窖裏吃鴉片煙的人。我雖然夠不上說是甚麼藝術家之流亞，但是我却是跟在藝術家們的屁股的後頭混了二十年的。不用說藝術界的榮枯，也和我有直接的關係。向來我雖然不願意被人利用，專門替人家跑龍套，搖旗吶喊，但我却很願意做勇敢戰士的一員。雖然我的能力微弱的可憐，可是我抱却着一腔拯救藝術界出水火登袵席的野心。所以我很希望藝術界的同志們聯合起來，作大規模的運動，以拯救整個的藝術界，但同時我也很想想盡我自己的力量，來拯救或者改善藝術界的一小部分。我相信團體之所以不好，完全出於分子之惡劣，在我沒有力量可以改善團體之時，我總要保持我自己的分子不致惡劣，我是硏究國畫山水的。我想本着我的理想，一面遊山，一面作畫，在幾年以內　成功一種畫法，把幾百年來相習成風的臨摹主義掃除　，給垂亡的山水畫注射一劑强心針，使牠有一點復活的生氣。同時我還很想用近代批評的眼光，把歷代的畫論從新估價，加以嚴正的抉別，以免再使謬毒流傳。這兩樣事情，我想竭力的把它做到，大家要從自己所硏究的一門切實改造起，負責起，那末整個的團體的改善，以至新作風的奠定，是可以做到的了。</p>
<p>現在謹以會員的資格，馨香禱祝諸同志各自努力達到最高的目的！並深切盼望中華美術協會的發展！</p>
<h3>我加入美協的願望</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>中華美術協會之成立，於我國藝術前途，一定會形成大的推動的力量。美術，無論從那一方面看，都是民族精神之最高的表現，並且，是民族的元氣，所以促進向上的原動力，則這集團所疑會是新時代的號角的。</p>
<p>我原來不是一個硏究美術的人。在我幼年時代，圖畫還未曾列入主要科目。家族環境不使我稍微接近音樂。彫塑建筑之類，更是很久以後才略微接觸的。我之加入美協，是不能做什麼工作的。我旣不能執畫筆，也不能握彫刀，我只是一個完全的門外漢。</p>
<p>但很久以前，我就有一種感覺，以爲我們在藝術的途程上，所有的幾乎完全是借來的東西。不僅介紹和模倣西洋的藝術是借用的，就是復古的一方面，亦復是借來的。引用古代的一切，每忘失其時代的意義，而空存古人面目。我們應該在自己的國土，自己的時代，創造出一點什麼來。</p>
<p>這决不是一句空話。惟有在自己的土地裏植了根的，這才能垂於久遠，也才能夠產生促進上向的力量。這固然要待於創作者的努力，但也待有另一部人爲之驅除廓淸。</p>
<p>怎麼樣建立起在自己的國土裏植了根的美學呢？怎麼樣建立起時代所需要的美術批評呢？怎麼樣爲新的美術，眞正產生於這時代而且亦爲這時代所要的美術淸除道路呢？我願意在這鉅大的工作裏拾起一　，做這裏面的一名小工。</p>
<p>這就是我加入美協的願望。我希望在這偉大的集團裏能夠有一點小小的進展。</p>

<h3>論節育</h3>
<p>— 程浩</p>
<p>珊格爾夫人束來了，這是第二决。　　這件事在東方人的腦海裏居然又激起了一朶小小的浪花，正如第一决東來時一樣。人們對夫人的行動，截至今日爲止，還是毁譽參半：她到香港的時候，據說有位老牧師說她的提倡節育是美國人性道德的墮落；也聽說某國擬不讓珊格爾夫人登陸；珊格爾夫人的不爲軍國主義者所歡迎，自然爲理所當然。</p>
<p>目前整個地球的運命都操縱在帝國主義者的手裏，帝國主義相互間非火併一下不能分出高下，人類正當準備大屠殺的時候，節育主義的提倡，自然成了「反動」，他們正要獎勵生育，無限制的生育，獎勵生產戰神的祭品！</p>
<p>但到底還有許多兇手以外的人，懷着熱烈的心，去歡迎這位有着堅决的救世信仰的人。</p>
<p>事實是擺在眼前的：</p>
<p>人類終究是需要向上的，人類的智慧也需耍一天天的提高的。我們不能蠢豬似的徒在世上充一頭啃穀獸，我們要爲世界從事創造，要爲人類從事建設，所以我們連帶的提出「敎育」的口號。</p>
<p>一個人對於養育子女應當認爲人類最神聖的義務。凡人旣不能放棄這神聖的義務，那末，如何克盡共義務，便成爲常前重要的問題。假使我們把兒童仍當作小動物似的喂養着，就算是盡了義務，那我們再談節育問題也必成爲多餘的事。可是自愛倫凱以來，兒童在人羣中被發現了，兒童須有適當的敎育也成爲天經地義了，做父母的放棄這義務，不僅將淪爲兒童的仇人，抑且爲人類的摧殘者。</p>
<p>我們曾經看見過多少不幸的靑年夫婦們，爲了無節制的生育，將生活攪得脆臲不安，他們旣無力敎養一大羣的孩子，但他們還是毫不覺醒到不節育的錯誤。</p>
<p>在社會諸大問題中，如死亡率的增高，若不抹煞事實的話，誰也會承認有一部分是由於不健全的兒童在無節制的產生中造成的罪惡。流浪在街頭的孩子到處充斥着，種種可憐悲慘的現象，還不是由於父舟種下的「不敎育」的原因嗎？至於貧窮問題，童工問題，雖不完全發源於此，但若過細地研究起來，却無不多少與此發生聯帶的關係。</p>
<p>除了第二代的兒童不講外，我們再推論到父母們的自身，他們生活於世界，究竟不是徒作一世家庭的牛馬，兒女的奴隸，他們應該貢獻一份最好的活力給人羣社會，使人羣社會積許多人的貢獻成一份優厚的產業，遺留到歷史上，這樣，一個人的生存才不失其生存的意義。但若一大羣的兒女牽掛在臂上腿上，使父母喘息的機會都沒有，那末父母的一生，除了爲兒女爲個人張羅生活的必需品外，將沒有餘力顧慮到其他了。碌碌以生，碌　以死，這都是人類莫大的損失。</p>

<h3>社會科學的攻用</h3>
<p>— 怡眞</p>
<p>人類的生存是離不開物質的供給的。爲要達到自身生存的目的，就必須從事勞動。，但勞動的對象是什麼呢？這就是一切自然界的生產物。入類用各種不同的勞動方法，對自然界的生產物加以改變，使牠適合於自身的生活需要，或者藉此抵抗自然界對人類的種種侵害，以達到持續生命的目的。</p>
<p>但個人的力量是有限的，而自然界的範圍則非常的廣闊。爲要達到向自然界爭取生活資料或抵抗自然界侵害的目的，便必須把個人的力量加以結合，以集合的方式向自然界作鬥爭。這樣就形成以勞動爲中心的人類社會。從入類社會進化史的研究過程上，我們就可以瞭解這種關係：人類勞動的結合越密切，他的勞動方法和勞動工具便越進步，因而，他向自然爭取所獲得的結果，也就愈加豐富。入類便藉此改進他的生活，獲得更大的享受。</p>
<p>由此看來，個人是不能離開社會而單獨生存的。他必須參加一定的社會關係和生產關係，作爲一個團體的細胞，共同維持生命的持續。有的人也許認爲像魯賓遜那樣便可以生存在一個孤島上，但這根本是一種傳奇的幻想，卽使能够暫時的生存，終歸是要被毁滅的。</p>
<p>人類旣然不能脫離社會而獨存，就必須對他賴以生存的社會作澈底的認識。這樣他可以明瞭他所處的地位，所負的歷史使命，以及决定對社會制度的態度。例如：在目前沒落期的資本主義社會中，因人間的壓迫和剝削，使大多數的人類陷於貧困和　餓，不呢個享受他自身勞動的結果。對於這樣的一種社會制度應如何的變革，應持什麼態度，這是每一個人所應該研究認識的。但怎樣去認識呢？這就只有研究社會科學了。</p>
<p>人類社會的現象是非常錯綜複雜的。允其是現代的資本主義社會，因物質的進步，生產組織的龐雜，形成各種形形色色的現象。要對這些現象加以理解，必須依賴科學。</p>
<p>所謂科學就是從許多混亂複雜的現象中尋出因果關係的法則。因爲無論在自然界或人類的社會中，現象怎樣的混亂複雜，彼此之間總有一種依存性和必然性。根據着這種關係，我們就可以系統地理解許多現象的發生，長成和其必然的結果。例如：因爲下了大雪，天氣就變得非常的寒冷，下雪與天氣寒冷這兩個現象之間就是一種因果關係。又如：因爲資本主義生產的無政府性而發生經濟恐慌，因恐慌的驅使，資本家便積極掠奪市塲，因而造成帝國主義的戰爭。在這幾個現象之間，就存在着一種必然性。社會科學便是利用這種科學的方法，從混亂複雜的社會現象中尋出其因果關係和必然性的。</p>
<p>不過，在科學的頒域中，因爲研究的對象不同，牠的分類也不同。大概可以分成自然科學和社會科學兩種。人類</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>社會本來也是自然現象之一，所以把社會科學從分離的原因，是由於社會科學具有以下的特點：</p>
<p>第一，社會現象，一切都是有意識的，而自然現象則是無意識的。例如：人類對於某一種的社會制度感覺不滿，起來加以改革，則是因為這種客觀事實反映於人類的意識中所引起的一種行動。所以，社會現象必須經過人類的意識纔能發生。</p>
<p>第二，社會現象，一切都是有目的的，而自然現象則是無目的的。例如：蜘蛛和蜜蜂所結成的蛛網及建筑的蜂巢，也許要比人類的織工和木匠來得精巧。但是人類之所以不同於這種動物，是他在著手工作之前頭腦中已先有了一定的圖樣，按照預定的目的去工作。所以勞動過程最後所表現的結果，在勞動開始的時候早已存在於勞動者的觀念之中了。</p>
<p>第三，社會現象中的勞動和自然現象的中的勞動，形式絕不相同。在自然現象中，大部份是沒有勞動表現的，即使有也與人類的勞動不同。例如：動物中也有采取果實或撲殺別的動物作為自身生活資料的，但牠只能利用自身的自然力，如爪牙等。而人類的勞動則不僅利用自身的自然力，同時還能利用自己所制造的勞動器具。所以，福蘭克林曾給人類下了個定義說：人類是制造器具的動物。</p>
<p>上面所舉的幾點，就是社會現象之所以異於自然現象的特點。社會科學就基於這些特點而單獨的構成一種科學。</p>
<p>宇宙間一切的現象都是變化的，流動不居的。即一切都是發生，長成和蛻化的一種過程。社會現象當然不能例外。自從人類的原始共產社會以來，經過了奴隸社會，封建社會，以至現代的資本主義社會，都是基於這種原則而變遷的。社會科學就是以這種現象為對象，而加以研究探討，尋找其因果關係的法則。</p>
<p>人類以什麼基礎構成他的社會？各時代的經濟政府制度為什麼不同？社會為什麼要不斷的變革？這些都是社會科學所要探討的重要問題。雖然這一時代與別一時代是怎樣的不同，社會現象是怎樣的錯綜復雜，但根據因果關係的法則，可以發現其中的必然關係。例如在資本主義的社會中，因機器的發明和勞動分工的改進，促進生產力的發展，建立了現代的工廠制度，因而構成資本主義的生產關係。根據這種生產關係，又建立了市民的民主政治。不過在這種生產關係之下，就把人類分成市民和勤勞者兩大壁壘。動勞者終日勞動而不能溫飽，市民只是擁有生產工具，反坐享動勞者的生產物。因此人間的剝削，壓迫，以及失業，饑餓，恐慌，戰爭等即隨之而生，造成社會的不安。</p>
<p>所有這些現象的發生，都是牠歷史的必然性。我們理解了這種關係，便可以知道因生產力與生產關係的衝突，社會不得不發生變革。這就是社會科學所負的使命，所暴露的真理。人類根據這種真理的認識，便可起而謀社會的改革及其自身生活的改善。</p>
<p>由於上面所說，我們便可以知道研究社會科學的目的和重要了。但在研究的過程中，有幾點是我們所不能不注意的：</p>
<p>第一，是社會科學的實踐性。如果是研究科學而拋棄了實踐，根本就成為無用的東西，何況與人類有密切關係的社會科學呢。</p>
<p>第二，一切現象都是流動不居的，必須從牠動的關係上去理解，纔能得到正確的認識。</p>
<p>第三，真理是相對的，而不是絕對的。要從現象的矛盾發展過程上去認識的，纔不至誤人歧途。如果只是看見樹木而不見森林，這是不能得到正確理解的。</p>
<p>總之，社會科學是理解社會現象的利器。在目前經濟恐慌，武裝掠奪和戰爭危機加緊的時代，時常有許多現象苦於不能明瞭，這就更加增加我們研究的迫切性了。</p>

<h3>風雪之國</h3>
<p>— 元伯辰</p>
<p>蘇聯堪察加通訊</p>
<p>堪察加是蘇聯西伯利亞的一個行政區。它的南部是堪察加半島，北部包括著從巨柯基半島至臺戈羅士半島的廣大地域；面積約為一百十萬啟羅米突（公里），海岸綫有一萬六千啟羅米突之長。在南部的堪察加半島上有很多山岳。這些山岳大多是火山，其中有正在冒煙的活火山十七座，就在很遠的地方也可見到那煙霧彌漫的現象；此外還有死火山五十七座，這是未曾表現出什麼現象的。因為是這樣多的火山，所以此間幾乎到處都有溫泉湧出；就在冬季都可見到居民們在溫泉中沐浴；假使這是在溫帶，那是會要成為一個大的溫泉境地的。</p>
<p>半島的西海岸很少港灣，但東海岸的良港卻很多；如控制堪察加的中心都市百特羅波羅甫士克市的亞瓦金斯加港便是具有最良好的港灣條件的。</p>
<p>全堪察加行政特區位置在北冰洋之南，千島羣島之北，氣候當然是屬於極寒帶的。雨量很多，雪花更是幾乎恒常地在空中飛舞，所以堪察加又名風雪之國。但是，實際上這里也並非全無季節之分。大概從十月到四月都可說是冬季，這時差不多每天都下著大雪，括著可怕的西北風，寒氣之峻烈是生活在溫帶的人所想像不到的；然而，一到夏季，空氣，居民，便都活潑起來了，這時就是堪察加的所謂漁業時期。</p>
<p>到了將近漁業時期時，從別處到這兒來捕魚的人可說是絡繹不絕，所以此間夏季的人特別的多。不過經常住在這里的卻只有人數很少的幾種土人；這幾種土夫各自所佔的數量如下：</p>
<p>居克基人　約一萬二千</p>
<p>戈利克　約八千</p>
<p>伊特門人　約千人</p>
<p>愛斯基摩人　約一千五百</p>
<p>亞列夫特人　約三百</p>
<p>居勒茲人　約五百</p>
<p>滕格斯人　約二千</p>
<p>拉姆特人　約一千五百</p>
<p>堪察達人　約四千五百</p>
<p>在這些土人中，堪察達人和愛斯基摩人，主要的是以魚類為食糧，其他的土人則喫臺上鹿和海獸類，多半還過著遊牧生活。</p>
<p>如上所述，想來堪察加一定是很荒涼，苦寒的蠻荒之地。但對於這樣的地方，蘇聯卻並不輕視；他們是在『堪察加工業化』的口號之下，正在努力開發其富源；並且特別設立了一個堪察加股份公司（一九三四年一月一日設立的），集合了五千二百萬盧布的資本，專門來舉辦這里的漁業，農業，森林，牧畜，采炭，運輸等全般事業。</p>
<p>這里的森林面積約有二十二萬平方啟羅米突，在百特羅波羅甫士克市外，已設立了三處制製木材的工場。此外如石油石炭等，現在也正在積極調查，開發中，將來純正未可預料。</p>
<p>蘇聯當局現正在努力向堪察加移民。因此，在人口的增加中，當然要發生食料問題；但這個問題是他們早就在注意到了的，他們在移民中也同時在這里努力栽培菜蔬，殼物等等；依他們的計劃，大概在一九三七年末這里的菜蔬，殼類，乳製品等就都可自約自足了。這計劃已表現出的成績可以從下面的事實看到——</p>
<p>去年度堪察加已有：</p>
<p>集體農戶　七八·五％</p>
<p>牽引車　二十架</p>
<p>國營農場　七七二公頃</p>
<p>集體農場　六六四公頃</p>
<p>個人農場　一〇九公頃</p>
<p>總播種面積二·〇〇〇公頃</p>
<p>堪察加的最主要的產業不消說是漁業；在堪察加半島西海岸，從五月至十月之間，便是漁業的最盛時期。沿岸的居民為要得到自己一家人和牲畜的食糧，這時都要努力去捕捉魚類，同時政府更是科學地大規模地從事漁業，上述的堪察加股份公司在這一件事上便是負著很大任務的。</p>
<p>據我們所知道的，這里已有十六個魚類的罐頭工場；在　　　　　　　　　　　　　場和船舶修理工場等。除了漁業工人之外，那些實際從事漁業的漁夫，在一九二八年時是三千人，但在一九三四年時便增加到一萬六千人了。單從這一點也可見到蘇聯在堪察加的漁業發展之速度了。</p>
<p>關於蘇聯在堪察加的漁業發展情形，我們還可用如下的兩件事實來表明——</p>
<p>一，國營漁業所獲（單位一千辛特奈）：</p>
<p>一九二八年　一九三四年</p>
<p>撒濛魚巽魚　一九九·四　六六九·六</p>
<p>青魚　——　六三·〇</p>
<p>大口魚　九·九　六一·二</p>
<p>蟹　二〇·四　一四·三</p>
<p>其他　——　四六·五</p>
<p>總計　二二九·七　八四〇·三</p>
<p>二，國營魚類製造物（單位一千特奈）：</p>
<p>一九二八年　一九三四年</p>
<p>撒濛魚巽魚罐頭　一七三·五　三三五·四</p>
<p>蟹罐頭　一三·八　七·五</p>
<p>撒濛魚巽魚鹽藏　六三·九　二三〇·〇</p>
<p>至於堪察加的全部經濟，在『工業化』的口號尚未完全實現的目前，主要地還是漁業和牧畜的經濟狀態，一般社會生活當然也是這種狀態的生活。關於漁業的大概情形，上面已介紹過了，現在還要簡略地談談這兒的畜牧情況。</p>
<p>因為風土和氣候的關係，普通的牛馬和豚類是不易在堪察加生活的，所以，這里的牧畜主要的是馴鹿和犬。在曠野中，在一般場所，都可以看到大小的馴鹿成羣結隊地在行動，誰也數不清究竟有多少。至於犬，在這里更是重要，凡是搬運貨物，狩獵，乃至行路，都離不了它；在別的地方的牛馬的職務，這兒可說全是由犬代替的。因此，堪察加人對於犬非常重視，家家戶戶都養著不少的犬，以應自己生活的需要。據我們所知道的，此間在一九一〇年時共約有犬二萬頭，一九二六年時，約有五萬頭，一九三一年時，就約有七萬頭了。單就這個數目字看來，也可知道此間的犬實比土人的</p>

<h3>玉礦工人</h3>
<p>— 焦女士</p>
<p>雲南騰衝通訊</p>
<p>翡翠綠玉，在現代人裝飾品中，要算是最流行的一種；其價值的昂貴，也頗不亞於一般人視為珍品的金鋼鑽石。自美國支加哥博覽會中陳列了筆商張文棣出品的『翡翠三絕』後，中國翡翠的聲價更躍千丈，漸為世界所屬目了。但翡翠玉石雖為裝飾珍品，又為人人所希冀的罕物，可是牠的出產地和開采的情形，恐怕能知道得清楚的人卻是百不得一的吧？</p>
<p>玉石廠是在雲南和緬甸『未定界』的北段，處於戶拱之南，猛拱之西，約北緯二十五度與二十六度之間；在那里的霧露河上游沿岸一帶，產玉的區域縱橫約有百餘分階段。該區域原是歸孟養土司的幹昔和賴賽兩頭目——又稱坐把，都為蒲蠻野人——分管的；自英併緬甸後，勢力侵入猛拱各地，兩頭目遂率眾歸降，但英人仍使其管轄原地。這里玉石廠計有東摩，格地模，蔴檬，帕甘及媽薩各廠；歸幹昔頭人（　宵名）管者　　　卡（又名匯庸）廠，歸賴賽頭人管者，有東摩廠，其餘都稱老廠，其開采因環境而互異。</p>
<p>所謂老廠，其開采的歷史都有數百年之久，論是華人，不緬人，野人或擺夷人，山邊水窪都可隨意開采，絕無開采權的限制。其開采方法：先勘定無人挖過的地方，以小樹枒或竹條一根插入作為標識，然後用香燭紙錢三牲焚祭，禱祝神靈的庇佑，早得玉石，祭祀完畢，才開始動工了。開挖時的工人多少不等，有二三人或四五人合挖一洞，有六七人至十餘人合挖一洞；挖洞的深淺也沒一定的標準，有將挖至二三尺即現玉層，也有挖至二三丈始現石層。石層厚而密的洞，希望較大，俗謂之『好洞』。但也有在疏薄的石層中獲得玉石，甚至有挖開草皮泥土即獲玉石，俗謂之『草皮礦』；又有流盤血汗，費時四五月而一無所獲者，也很尋常。費時較長而無所獲者多為河邊礦洞；開挖這種礦洞，須一面用竹筒扯水，一面開挖，費時極多，如翻至底層，發現泥土，就全功盡棄，毫無希望了。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>開挖資本可分自挖與勞資合挖兩種。自挖祇要準備少許的伙食費用，得玉卽為個人所有。至於勞資合挖，卽由一人出資僱工開挖，貼伙食盧比（印幣）十元，得玉各分一半，如始終絲毫無所得，則老板白貼伙食，僱工也白出氣力。開出玉石後，例須繳百分之十的稅欵，也由勞資雙方均攤；幹昔和賴賽頭人每年在玉石上的稅欵收入倒不在少數。開挖玉石者，除繳百分之十的「出地稅」外，還得再繳百分之三十三給英政府的猛拱稅崗，呌做國家稅。</p>
<p>老厰各地每年秋未，挖玉者卽陸續而來，人數近二萬左右，到第二年三四月間，玉石商人也絡繹於途，爭相購買，這樣大約再經過一個月的時期，工商便都紛紛離厰，但也有數千工人未挖獲玉石，窮困無計，在厰地度夏者，這呌做「打雨水」。夏季挖玉，多利用雨水冲洗：方法多於山坡較高處開闢小溝，把水中雨水引入溝內，導入洞旁稍高之處，開鑿水池貯蓄，於是把洞土挖鬆，放水冲下，這樣，溝內鬆土卽被水沖洗而去，照樣再挖再沖，俟洞內泥土沖　至石層為止，然後補檢石層。這種方法可省却不少人工挑土的力量，不過過乾冬無水時却無法實行，且厰地　毒頗盛，在這裏度夏的往往病死，所以他們簡直是以性命掉換實物的。</p>
<p>東　稱新厰，開採也有數十年的歷史：採玉者須先向地主幹昔頭目購地，地價頗昂，每二方丈由數千元至數萬元不等。把地購妥，然後由總洞門入，向所購方位暗中摸索。這種厰的玉石，在地面以下約十四五丈深，係靑石中夾玉石　一層，採玉者須把靑石　　，然後才能取得玉石，所以工作比較老厰艱難。鑿石的方法，有用汽機敲打的，也有用炭火焚燒的，把石打碎後，卽由人工背負而上。入厰的工人，都手持一燈，傴僂前行，每八小時輪換一次，盡夜不停，生活極其慘苦。各戶所購地位全憑命運而走（開玉工商都有此種迷信），有出好玉者，有出玉不多者，都難有一定的標準；所得玉石仍須到猛拱繳納上崗稅，但無須再納出地稅。夏季開玉，洞內常為水所淹，到冬卽以機器排水；每年開採時期僅有春季，開採時約有苦力五六百人，工作極其緊張迅速，因遲恐全功盡棄。新厰所出玉石，水色常較老厰各洞所出綃嫩，俗稱為新山玉。</p>
<p>猛拱稅崗抽收標準分玉石琥珀兩種：玉石抽百分之三十三，琥珀抽百分之五。前十數年稅欵都由雲南　　鉅商承攬包收，每三年訂包一次。在　每年所認欵額不過盧比數萬元，所以每年都有　餘。自一九二九年十月起，因多數華商不顧大局，羣起競爭，英政府遂抬高稅額，每年須繳納十九萬二千元，較之往昔驟增數倍，據最近所收崗稅欵額計之，每年所出玉石價值約在百餘萬元之譜。但此地英人特放烟賭禁例，新老各厰几無處不有烟館賭攤的設立；分門別類，賭法各種都有，賭捐也為承包制，每年可收盧比約七千餘元；烟館並不收捐，但售價極昂。走厰挖玉者，百分之六十為華人，百分之四十為緬人及野人，一旦得有工作，烟館賭攤卽視作樂園，須臾都不肯離去，因此，在這裏有開玉半生者，仍舊是現着及不蔽體，食不果腹的慘象。我們祇要站在霧露河畔抬頭一望，但可以見到許多荒塚，而這些荒塚就是這班開玉工人最後的歸處了。</p>
<p>世界知識</p>
<h3>世界各主要宗敎的現狀</h3>
<p>— 實華</p>
<p>宗敎與人類生活有很密切的關係，它僅有支配人類的表面行為的力量，而且還能支配人的心靈。在往昔政敎一致的時候，國家的政治敎育幾乎都是在宗敎支配之下的，如阿剌伯與土耳其等國的回敎，歐洲的基督敎，在過去都有至高無上的權威；就是在現在，宗敎在政治上的權威雖然還不及過去，但在一般塲合，它的力量和作用依然不小，而且在某些地方，宗敎和政治的統制力量也還很强大（例如西藏的喇嘛敎）。因為宗敎對於人類生活有如此重大的關係，所以凡是留心社會問題的都不得不對它特別注意。在這里，我們所要說的，便是現今世界所有的各主要宗敎的現狀，以帮助我們去了解人類的宗敎生活，以及宗敎和一切社會問題的關係。</p>
<p>第一要說的是加特力敎，即天主敎。據說羅馬加特力敎會的信徒的總數現在有三億五千多萬人之多，佔全世界總人口數的百分之十九；換句話說，就是現在全人類有百分之十九的心靈是被加特力敎的敎義所支配的。</p>
<p>以國家來說，南歐的意，法，比，西班牙及葡萄牙，中歐的波蘭和奥大利，以及中美南美諸國，都是主要信奉加特力敎的國家；此外如德國有三分之一以上的國民是加特力敎的信徒；荷蘭則有半數以上的國民是信仰加特力敎的；其他世界各國，除蘇聯以外，几乎每一個國家都有這個宗敎的信徒。它的力量之大，對於人類生活關係之深切，於此可見。</p>
<p>有這樣多的信徒，包含了這樣多的民族的加特力敎，共有十四個總司敎區，一千三百多個司敎區及　敎區；在這下面，還有無數的小敎區，以敎區所屬的信徒。敎會的中央機關是敎皇廳，其下有十二個　　和三個敎會裁判所；全敎會都是由同一個敎會法統治着的。在現今的宗敎中，佛敎，基督敎和回敎都可說是世界的宗敎，但是超越國界，以嚴密的組織統制着，並信奉同一敎條，舉行同一儀式的，只有加特力敎。</p>
<p>這樣大的敎會機構的威力，在目前的危機四伏的世界中不消　是具有很大的作用。但這作用並不是超民庭超國界超人羣的，而是在這些之下起着大的作用，雖然它的組織是統一的超越國界的。這里我們可以首先舉出意大利的加特力敎來，在意大利的憲法上明白規定着以加特力敎為其國敎，今意的人民幾乎都是加特力敎的信徒。莫梭里尼登台以後，據說是為尊重意大利的精神文化，特別保障敎廳，並把多年廢止的加特力敎宗敎敎育在中小學中復活了。同時，敎廳也贊助黑衣宰相的統一政策，禁止敎中有重要職位的人參加政治活動，並解散了加特力黨。最近，莫梭里尼遠征東菲，羅馬敎皇起初是希望事件能和平解决，但後來也就贊助黑衣宰相「傳播文明」的行為了。就這些事實看來，加特力敎在意大利所起的作用便是極明白的，實在也用不着再加解說。其次，我們還可以談談德國的加特力敎。在希特勒未獲得政權之前，當左右兩極端的鬥爭在德國正尖銳的時候，德國加特力敎的信徒有許多是與希特勒共鳴的。但希特勒上台後却要以國社黨的綱領來支配敎會，要禁止言論自由，即敎會團體也不准有什麽社會活動。同時，因為德國的經濟危機日益深化，使政府不得不實行極端地管理匯兌，甚至禁止一個　帶十馬克以上的貨幣出境，這對於德國加特力敎的向外派遣宣敎師，對於已在國外的德國傳敎者的生活，當然是有極大的妨害的。過去就有一個女修道院的院長，因送欵與國外的女敎士而被捕了，判處徒刑八年。此外類似這樣的事情還很多，不能一一在這裏細舉。可是這麽一來，當然加特力敎與希特勒政府在德國的衝突也就很尖銳了。其結果如何，現在雖還不能具體判斷，不過，看看意大利的加特力敎和莫梭里尼的關係，以及德國加特力敎在過去的表現，也可以知道它現在和將來所起的作用的。至於其他各國的加特力敎，也許在某些表現上有些差異，但其本質却是相同的。</p>
<p>第二是猶太敎。信奉這個宗敎的，不消說主要是猶太人。據大概的統計，現今猶太人分布世界的情况如下：（單位千人）</p>
<p>以上是各主要國家中猶太人的數量：把全世界的猶太人合計起來，有一千五百六十萬人，佔世界人口約百分之一。這　猶太人雖有他們的宗敎，却沒有自己的國家；過去雖有猶太國再建運動，但終於沒有建立起來。現在他們到處受欺侮，被輕視，在德國甚至連居住的權利都沒有了。這件事情充分敎訓了我們：一個民族，如果沒有了自己的國家，那即使還保存着自己的宗敎，自己的精神文化，也是沒有一點用處的。</p>
<p>第三是回敎。在歷史上曾經有一個時期回敎是很强盛的；就是在現在，它也還有不可輕視的力量，在伊蘭高原，小亞細亞，阿拉伯以及我們的新疆，甘肅一帶，都有　廣大的徒衆；此外，在埃及，在摩洛哥等地也很盛行。據統計，現在世界上共有回敎徒　〇九·〇二〇·〇〇〇人。</p>
<p>佛敎和基督敎都是超國家的，在這一點上回敎也與它們一樣。事實上回敎是政敎一體，祭政一致的。在祭神的時候，只有信徒和非信徒的差別，沒有人種民族的差異。不過，當看民族間起了什麽爭執時，回敎的信徒也頗愛他們的國家，在這一點上，愛國的熱情是可以而且也應該居於宗敎信仰之上的。</p>
<p>第四是喇嘛敎。這個宗敎可說是西藏特有的佛敎。所謂「喇嘛」，實是西藏語的優勝無上的意思。它的起源很古，大約在一千年以前就產生了。其後曾經過了几度變遷，在這些變遷中以宗喀巴的宗敎改革創立黃敎最有名；現在喇嘛敎中的宗喀巴之名，簡直如佛敎的創始者一樣的尊嚴。本來從前在西藏境內紅敎有絕大的勢力，但自宗喀巴倡宗敎改革創立黃敎後，紅敎就逐漸失勢了。現在西藏蒙古都成為了喇嘛敎的中心，但在這裏的喇嘛敎中黃敎的勢力約佔百分之七十，紅敎不過佔百分之二十，此外還有黑敎。至於西藏蒙古人對於喇嘛敎信仰之深，那是更用不着說。因為這宗敎與西藏和蒙古人的生活關係這樣深世，所以我們在處理西藏和蒙古問題時，對於那裏的人民的信仰，對於喇嘛敎更要了解和注意。</p>
<p>除了上述的宗敎之外，世界上當然還有許多宗敎。不過，因為篇幅關係，只好從略。現在，為要使大家對於世界各宗敎得到一個槪括的了解，特將現有世界各主要宗敎的敎徒人數書列如下：（單位千人）</p>
<p>基督敎　六八二，四〇〇</p>
<p>加特力敎　三三一，五〇〇</p>
<p>希臘　敎　一四四，〇〇〇</p>
<p>敎　二〇六，〇二〇</p>
<p>回敎　二　九，〇二〇</p>
<p>印度敎　二三〇，一五〇</p>
<p>佛敎　一五〇，一八〇</p>
<p>猶太敎　一五，六三〇</p>
<p>其他　五〇，八七〇</p>

<h3>南昌胜跡</h3>
<p>— 楊朱</p>
<p>談起南昌來，很多人會聯想到王勃的「滕王閣序」，所謂「落霞與孤騖齊飛，秋水共長天一色」，似乎江南也沒有這樣好的風景；然而問起南昌人來，沒有不啞然而笑的，實際上所謂滕王閣也者，不過是一個「地以文傳」的徒負虛名的名勝，本地人所見的，簡直和外地人一樣，也不過是一塊石刻的「序文」而已，其餘一無所有！文章騙人，莫些為甚，比「西湖十景」還要荒唐百倍。</p>
<p>然而，南昌有幾處名勝是值得叙述的：</p>
<p>百花洲　在南昌城中心，四面圍繞着東湖，曲橋流水，綠楊掩映，極「水木清華」之勝。「冠鰲亭」　立其中，有俯瞰全湖之勢。在夏季之夜，放舟湖心，荷香較西湖為勝。而夕陽下岸頭的鞭絲帽影，凭「冠鰲亭」而望，尤令人與「人在畫中」之想</p>
<p>三村　在南昌城外蓼洲東，桃花極盛。三村者，前村，中村，後村也。當春季桃花盛開，三村遍地桃林，村中居民也大都以種桃為業。不過所產的桃實不佳，味澀且不甜，比之龍華桃，當有「上下床之別」。至於桃林的數量，實數倍於「龍華」，可惜位置不在通都大邑，未免辜負了好風景啦。</p>
<p>孺子亭　就是紀念「下陳蕃之榻」的徐孺子的，環境淸幽，最適宜於綠楊影裏閑坐品茗，是一個値得留連的所在。</p>
<p>澹臺墓　古澹臺墓在澹　門外，傳說是澹臺滅明的墓。墓上古碑不少，建築雖不甚雄偉，但也可以看到一點古代墓道的建築形式。四周的風景，因為在城外之故，饒有野趣。</p>
<p>靑雲譜　是一座古廟，以桂花著名，桂花不但多而且有不少的奇種。有一株古桂，大可合抱，是五株合生的，據說已有數百歲的高齡了，却仍然很茂盛，每當秋季，香開數里。</p>

<p>魚類有無嗅覺和聽覺，對於這一個問題是已經有常識的判斷和謻實騐的報吿的，用不着我們多說。現在還待研究的，是魚類究竟喜歡聽什麽聲音，亦卽是人們究竟要利用怎樣適當的聲音才能將魚類誘集起來，這樣的頗有興味的問題。</p>
<p>在現今世界上，魚業最興盛的不消說要挪威。因此，關於魚類和一切水產的研究，在挪威也是格外進步的。現在，這裏就有一位水產研究所的所員，名呌格爾加托，對於研究誘導魚類的聲音非常熱心；他的研究經過和成果不消說對於世界魚業，對於科學，都很有關係的。</p>
<p>對於池水中的魚類，我們要用一種聲音把它驚動起來，這都不算很難的</p>

<h3>Sino-British Boundary Survey Commission Suppressing Yonghe's Local Militia</h3>

However, the local militia of Yonghe, which is under the jurisdiction of Lan Cang, usually relies on the power of the church and commits all kinds of evils. Last winter, they colluded with the Ma Ka bandits to burn and loot, leaving Mengjiao Dong completely desolate. This time, when the survey team passed through the villages under the jurisdiction of Yonghe, they dared to obstruct and fire on our officers and soldiers and two members of our Liang Yin Committee.

The villages under Yonghe have been pacified, and they will forever be obedient citizens of China.

<h3>France and Belgium Abolish Treaty with Germany; Do Not Want to Cause War; But Want to Form a Military Alliance with Britain; League of Nations Officially Invites Germany to Participate in the Conference</h3>
<p>London - When the Locarno Conference opens tomorrow, the representatives of France and this country will declare that they do not want to take actions similar to war, but the two countries will urge to study plans to deal with urgent interests. It is heard that the main purposes of French policy are as follows:</p>
<p>The League of Nations should force Germany to withdraw its troops from the Rhineland so that the German authorities can understand the fact that the policy has no benefits and no benefits can be obtained in the future.</p>
<p>France wants to conclude a new and more practical Locarno Public, which is equivalent to the establishment of a defensive military alliance between Britain, France and Belgium. If possible, it can be merged with today, or it can replace it.</p>
<p>France believes that what really endangers France's security today is not entirely the matter of Germany's troops entering the Rhineland, but something more serious than this, that is, to make Hitler realize that he can safely implement a policy of violence and create facts at will, and achieve results. To implement Czechoslovakia. Austria. Or Memel, France seems to have no intention of sending troops into the demilitarized zone today. France believes that increasing troops to defend the border bunkers and gathering a large army in the northeast is enough to guarantee France's current security. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>London - People close to the Foreign Office declared today that France had recently notified Britain that France was willing to compromise with Germany, but Britain should participate in economic and financial sanctions against Germany after German leader Hitler rejected this compromise proposal. If Britain can put forward a new plan to guarantee French security or conclude a treaty equal to the Franco-British military alliance, France may no longer insist on the sanctions policy. Is the situation now easing? Politicians are now preparing for Saturday's Executive Yuan meeting. Germany can at least accept half of Britain's compromise proposals. When German Ambassador to the UK Hoeke visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, he said that the League of Nations only stipulates sanctions against countries that have been proven to be aggressors and does not stipulate sanctions against countries that have abolished treaties. Foreign Minister Eden also raised this argument earlier. (National News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>London - League of Nations Secretary-General Ai Wennuo had previously informally invited Germany to send representatives to the League of Nations Executive Council meeting in the capacity of signatory countries to the Locarno Public, so as to respond to the applications submitted by France and Belgium. Germany has not yet replied. The Executive Council held a closed-door meeting at 1:00 PM today and decided to formally approve this invitation. The meeting was adjourned at 1:45 PM. (Havaqi Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - It is expected here that the German government will issue a document tonight to declare its attitude towards the current situation, which is mainly in the form of a communiqué. Political circles expect that Hitler's speech in Munich tonight will make a more peaceful decision on the political situation. There is no reason to measure that Germany will refuse to accept the invitation to participate in the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Executive Council Meeting: Speeches by Various National Representatives; France Demands Appropriate Measures to Address Germany's Treaty Abrogation; Britain Expresses Sympathy to France and Belgium</h3>
<p>The 91st Extraordinary Session of the League of Nations Executive Council convened this morning at 11:45 AM in the Queen Anne Room on the second floor of St. James's Palace in London. The meeting was chaired by Australian representative Bruce. French Foreign Minister Flandin immediately rose and delivered a lengthy speech, concluding with the following points: "Regarding Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, I request the Executive Council to determine that this action by Germany constitutes a violation of Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (concerning the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland). Furthermore, I request League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 2 of the Locarno Treaty, to notify all signatory nations of this decision by the Executive Council. The guarantor nations of the treaty should also fulfill their obligations regarding assistance to the invaded country (as stipulated in Article 4, paragraph 3). The Executive Council should also consider appropriate measures to be submitted to the member states of the League of Nations for implementation, to ensure the fulfillment of the obligation to assist the invaded country."</p>
<p>Prior to this, the representatives of the member states of the Executive Council held a closed-door meeting at 10:45 AM to determine the agenda for the open meeting. This concluded at 11:15 AM. The representatives then entered the Queen Anne Room. British Foreign Secretary Eden was seen conversing with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. Soviet Ambassador Maisky also spoke at length with Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov. At 11:45 AM, Australian representative Bruce, Chairman of the Executive Council, announced the opening of the meeting. French Foreign Minister Flandin sat to his right, followed by Italian Ambassador Grandi, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, and British Foreign Secretary Eden. After the opening, Chairman Bruce delivered an address, stating that King Edward VIII of Great Britain had graciously allowed the use of the Queen Anne Room at St. James's Palace for the Executive Council meeting, a gesture for which the British representatives should convey thanks to His Majesty. He then reported the agenda for the session, stating that the Locarno Treaty had been declared abrogated by Germany, and the governments of France and Belgium had submitted applications requesting the Executive Council to determine that Germany had violated Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles, as well as Article 1 of the Locarno Treaty. British Foreign Secretary Eden then spoke, expressing, on behalf of the British government, a welcome to the representatives of the various countries, and stating that "the future of the situation depends on whether the resolutions of the Executive Council are wise." The British government expressed deep sympathy for the anxieties held by the governments of France and Belgium. The views of those governments on this matter should be explained by their representatives. He specifically declared, on behalf of the British government, that Germany's actions in contravening the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty were "clear and indisputable." The British government would fully assist and cooperate with France and Belgium to safeguard peace. The measures to be taken in response to Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty should be determined by the Executive Council. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Following the opening of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting in London, British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech. This was followed by an address by French Foreign Minister Flandin, who outlined six points: 1. At the time of declaring the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, Germany immediately dispatched troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. According to official German figures, more than 30,000 regular troops have entered the Rhineland, which cannot be regarded as a "symbolic force." 2. France has submitted this case to the League of Nations Executive Council for handling, as a matter of obligation. However, France has not taken military measures. 3. Germany's pretext for abrogating the treaty is that the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact is in conflict with the Locarno Treaty. France has already submitted a response and proposed referring the matter to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for adjudication. However, Germany refused to comply and instead declared the abrogation of the treaty that it had freely signed. It should be noted that Article 8 of the Locarno Treaty originally stipulated that no signatory could unilaterally declare abrogation; it had to be approved by a two-thirds majority vote of the League of Nations Executive Council. 4. According to Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Locarno Treaty, any re-militarization of the Rhineland demilitarized zone in violation of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles constitutes an act of aggression and should be dealt with accordingly. 5. After Germany's treaty abrogation, France, the collective security system, and the League of Nations are all at risk. 6. Germany announced the reintroduction of conscription on March 15, 1935. The Executive Council passed a resolution on April 17 of that year to correct this. The French government now demands that it be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The extraordinary session of the League of Nations Executive Council in London convened its open meeting at 11:40 AM today. French Foreign Minister Flandin delivered a speech, followed by Belgian Prime Minister Janson, who stated, "The Locarno Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant are the foundation of Belgium's foreign policy. Belgium's border with Germany is longer than that of other countries, and its defenses are relatively weaker. Since Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, the threat faced by Belgium is greater than that faced by any other country. Furthermore, the pretext invoked by Germany for abrogating the treaty is the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, which has nothing to do with Belgium and cannot be forcibly linked. In fact, the Locarno Treaty was freely signed by Germany, and the obligations stipulated therein are mutual. Belgium believes that it is still necessary to fulfill them. Although Belgium is prepared to conclude new treaties to reshape Europe, it must currently request the League of Nations Executive Council to determine that Germany's treaty abrogation constitutes a violation of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and to notify all signatory nations." After Janson finished speaking, the meeting was adjourned and will reconvene at 3:30 PM next Monday. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Locarno Treaty Nations: Opinions Show Some Convergence; Meetings Continue</h3>
<p>The meeting of the signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty resumed at the Foreign Office at 5:30 PM and concluded at 7:30 PM. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain was the first to leave, with a worried expression. Lord Privy Seal Halifax and Italian Ambassador Grandi followed, also looking concerned. Grandi immediately returned to the embassy by car after leaving the meeting. According to a press release from the meeting, "The signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty continued to hold subcommittee meetings today to study the current situation. During the discussions, the views of the various countries have clearly converged, which is a cause for satisfaction. The next meeting is currently scheduled for 5:00 PM tomorrow." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The meeting of the signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty in London issued a press release yesterday at 7:30 PM, stating that the views of the relevant countries have clearly converged. It is understood that the points of convergence between Britain and France relate to how Britain should assist France and Belgium in the event of an attack by Germany, and what obligations it should undertake, which has been agreed to be confirmed. France originally advocated taking punitive measures against Germany and had made several demands, which it has agreed to temporarily reduce. Regarding this, informed sources claim that newspapers and influential figures in financial circles here believe that Germany's internal economic situation is already stretched thin. In the future, when Germany purchases goods from foreign countries, it should only be required to pay in cash, and the currently prevalent and advantageous clearing system should be suspended. This would inevitably make the country feel more difficult, which is also a form of sanction. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>The meeting of the signatory nations of the Locarno Treaty in London yesterday commissioned Belgian Prime Minister Janson to draft a memorandum for submission to the League of Nations Executive Council for discussion. Janson worked overnight with the Belgian delegation last night and completed the draft this morning. The Locarno Treaty signatory nations meeting will present this memorandum for study at this afternoon's meeting. It is generally understood that the memorandum contains two key points: 1. Explaining the views expressed at yesterday's meeting (referring to the fact that Belgium, France, Britain, and Italy all recognize that Germany's actions violate the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty). 2. Stating the points agreed upon by the four countries, namely: (A) Maintaining the principle of collective security within the framework of the League of Nations; (B) Belgium, France, Britain, and Italy are all determined to avoid war. Regarding this, Prime Minister Janson argued at the meeting that the representatives of the four countries should meet in the evening to study what extent future sanctions against Germany should be implemented to avoid the danger of war. Therefore, it is generally expected that, although the countries concerned will take various steps to make German troops withdraw from the Rhineland, the nature of these steps will not lead to war. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Sanctions Against Germany: Britain and France Harbor Different Intentions; German Troop Withdrawal to the Right Bank of the Rhine to be a Future Demand</h3>
<p>An unofficial meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory nations representatives took place here this morning at 11:00 AM. Although efforts to resolve Germany's treaty abrogation are proceeding slowly, a gesture of reconciliation is sought, such as agreeing to withdraw the troops sent into the Rhineland to the right bank of the Rhine. This has neither been acknowledged nor denied. Therefore, Chancellor Hitler's speech in Munich tonight is drawing much attention, as it may indicate Germany's attitude. It is rumored that the idea of refusing German export goods and restricting certain import goods is no longer in question, as differing opinions among the powers make this proposal difficult to implement. It is said that France plans to suspend the agreement on clearing bills for Germany, whose finances are already in difficulty. If this measure is implemented, it could quickly take effect. However, this plan is not supported by the Netherlands and Argentina, although discussions are still ongoing. Representatives of the Little Entente nations met last night to study the situation, chaired by the Romanian Foreign Minister. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in London indicated today that Britain has rejected France's proposed economic and financial sanctions against Germany. Therefore, efforts by the Locarno signatory nations to resolve the European crisis before Saturday's League of Nations Executive Council vote on sanctions against Germany have reached a deadlock. Having received guarantees of military assistance from the Soviet Union, France today refused to consider proposals to allow German troops to remain in the Rhineland. France has also proposed imposing sanctions, but Britain fears this would easily lead to war and is unwilling to bear that risk. However, France insists that the Executive Council should first severely punish Germany before considering measures to address Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty and occupation of the Rhineland. France has requested that Britain support sanctions in principle, but has not provided specific proposals. Informed sources claim that France is now considering blockading German exports and preventing the lending of funds to Germany. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov today. It is reported that they discussed the issue of coordinating the Little Entente and Balkan countries to jointly demand sanctions. France and Russia are today expressing dissatisfaction with Britain's wait-and-see policy and are deeply indignant at the attitude of the British Labor Party, which has unofficially declared to be too pro-German. However, private messages from Berlin state that the German General Staff is becoming increasingly uneasy, fearing that France may attack the Rhineland. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of imposing sanctions against Germany, the meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory nations has not yet reached a decision. French Foreign Minister Flandin will return to France in the middle of next week to consult with the cabinet on this matter. Once Flandin returns here, discussions will resume. It is generally understood that France still advocates imposing sanctions, but Britain and Italy are not very supportive, while Italy is adopting a reserved attitude. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office is Bustling; German Ambassador Also Visits Eden; But Claims No New Proposals Submitted</h3>
<p>Government circles in London claim that the British government has not communicated with Berlin, and the German side has not submitted any formal proposals to stabilize the overall situation. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Financial circles here are saying that Germany may accept the withdrawal of some troops from the Rhineland, the so-called "symbolic troop withdrawal," under certain conditions. However, this has not been confirmed. German Ambassador Hoesch visited Foreign Secretary Eden at 5:00 PM and left at 5:35 PM. According to Foreign Office sources, Hoesch provided Eden with supplementary explanations of the German perspective on the issue of German re-militarization of the Rhineland. German sources say that Germany has not submitted any new opinions to Britain regarding the Rhineland re-militarization issue. Ambassador Hoesch's visit to the Foreign Office was to discuss the issue of a bilateral naval agreement between Britain and Germany with naval expert Kleitch. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>The Foreign Office held a series of diplomatic talks this afternoon that were of great importance. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, and Polish Ambassador Raczyński held talks with Foreign Office Permanent Under-Secretary Vansittart. In addition, Vansittart received Chilean Minister to Britain Edwards and French Ambassador Corbin for discussions. Another Foreign Office official, Lord Cranborne, also held talks with the Yugoslav Minister to France, Brlić. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>French Minister Without Portfolio Penancier arrived here by plane today, carrying a report from the French General Staff on the German troop deployment in the Rhineland. The report believes that the German Air Force poses a threat to Britain. This report will be submitted to British Foreign Secretary Eden. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, Yugoslav Minister to France Brlić, and Czech Minister to Britain Masaryk held a meeting of the Little Entente nations here tonight. Afterward, a press release stated, "The Little Entente nations have adopted a completely unified stance on Germany's abrogation of the Locarno Treaty." Titulescu and Brlić also held separate talks with French Foreign Minister Flandin. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Capital of Romania: Rumors Circulate That the Soviet Union and Romania are Negotiating a Mutual Assistance Treaty. The Government Had Denied it Once, But in a Recent Session of the Chamber of Deputies, Foreign Secretary Radulescu, Representing the Government, Denied the Rumor Again.</h3>
<p>The leader of the Independent Liberal Party, Bratianu, questioned the government, saying that he heard that the government had taken the necessary measures to ensure that the national railway was fully prepared to transport Soviet troops and munitions from the country's border to the Czech border in a short period of time. Was this saying accurate? Interior Minister Gigurtu, representing the government, formally denied the saying, saying, "Under the current situation, this kind of unfounded rumor is enough to confuse people." It should be strongly condemned. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>On the Banks of the Rhine: Germany to Build Forts; There Are Currently 30,000 Troops Stationed</h3>
<p>A communiqué issued in Berlin today contained statements regarding Germany's plan to build forts in the Rhineland, stating that Germany must have the right to build forts or defense lines, which will be purely defensive in nature, to protect Germany's western frontier. This kind of fortification line will take several years to build, but for safety's sake, Germany cannot give up its right to fortify its western border. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Chancellor Hitler, due to the rapid changes in the European situation, has canceled his scheduled election speeches in various places and returned to Berlin, where he immediately held an emergency meeting with the top leaders of the National Socialist Party. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>German troops held exercises in the Rhineland today to strongly deny foreign press reports that some troops have already been withdrawn to ease the situation. A spokesman for the Propaganda Ministry announced today that there are at least 30,000 troops in the Rhineland, including 11,000 local police. These troops will remain stationed there. However, he declined to comment on reports from London that the German General Staff is deeply concerned that France will attack the Rhineland. Most Germans are skeptical about Germany returning to the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail recently declared that the total strength of German forces in the Rhineland, combining regular troops and military-type organizations, is 248,000, including 30,000 regular troops, 30,000 police who will soon be incorporated into the regular army, 30,000 labor service corps members with military training, 150,000 members of military-type organizations, and 8,000 to 10,000 foreign troops from the Austrian National Socialist Party. In addition, there are several motorized army units. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Following the abrogation of the Locarno Treaty, the people are feeling uneasy about the diplomatic situation. Newspapers are publishing many opinions to reassure them, saying that the situation will not lead to accidents, or that the meeting of the Locarno Treaty signatory nations in London can be equated with last year's Stresa Conference. The semi-official Foreign Correspondence Report specifically denied foreign rumors that Germany would not build fortifications in the Rhineland to facilitate negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italian Officialdom: Quietly Observing the Situation in London; The General Public: Gradually Feeling Uneasy</h3>
<p>Although Italian officialdom is observing the outcome of the London talks with a calm attitude, the general public is gradually becoming uneasy as they see the current tense situation. It is reported that when the Locarno signatory nations gathered in London today, Italian representative Grandi stated that the European situation has not been as serious as it is now since the Great War, due to the fact that the powers have adopted arbitrary and unfair sanctions policies in Geneva. If the Abyssinian issue is not resolved according to fair principles, then the powers cannot hope that Italy will take any action other than adopting a wait-and-see attitude. In this statement, the Italian representative has combined the Abyssinian issue and the Rhineland incident into one. Judging from this statement, Italy is unwilling to support sanctions against Germany. However, responsible parties deny reports that Italy is currently negotiating with France to lift the sanctions. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>The League of Nations Committee of Thirteen, which recently issued a proposal for peace between Italy and Abyssinia, will probably meet in London in the middle of next week. It is reported that the Italian delegation has requested the League of Nations Secretariat to hold the meeting in London. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Financial Policy and Its Impact on China</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Japan's new Finance Minister, Baba Kanji, has adopted a financial policy that is the opposite of that of the late Takahashi Korekiyo. The former advocates increasing taxes, issuing more public bonds, implementing policies towards Manchuria, and promoting the strengthening of national defense. The latter opposed increasing taxes, forcibly reducing debt, adopting a passive policy towards Manchuria, and suppressing increases in national defense spending. The "Takahashi Financial Textbook," which Japanese newspapers have consistently ridiculed, is welcomed by financial groups and industrialists. This is almost universally known. The purpose of this article is to explore Baba's financial policy and its relationship with China.</p>
<p>Leaving aside Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Disarmament Conference, where a shipbuilding race has become inevitable, even if Japan wants to expand reproduction to maintain the prosperity built on the military-industrial boom, it cannot avoid the demand for increased military spending. In a country where rural bankruptcy has reached its limit and the people are being pushed to the brink of starvation, expanding military spending can only be achieved by increasing taxes and issuing more public bonds, placing direct taxes on the shoulders of the poor masses. What will be the result? The victory of the proletarian parties in the recent general election is a clear answer. As for the consequences of issuing more public bonds, we know that increasing the "deficit" easily leads to "malignant inflation." At that time, prices will rise, wages will increase, and the light industry sector will naturally suffer from reduced competitiveness in foreign trade due to increased costs. Moreover, the amount of public bonds issued is close to 10 billion yen, almost reaching saturation. If they continue to issue more, the anxieties of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Yasuda, and the top five financial groups about "financial bankruptcy" will only intensify. Therefore, Baba's statement on the 10th caused a simultaneous drop in the prices of all securities on the stock exchange, which had just opened.</p>
<p>Looking at the investment of military spending in 1935, the private military-industrial factories received orders worth 277 million yen from the Navy and 106 million yen from the Army (the rest was invested in state-owned factories), totaling 383 million yen (the Navy accounted for two and a half times the Army, mostly divided by Mitsubishi and Kawasaki shipbuilding companies). Now, amid the clamor for increased military spending, those heavy industrialists and related financial groups that occupy a dominant position are still profitable due to the official profits gained from the military-industrial sector, even though capital income tax is collected. Only light industrialists are dissatisfied. However, the "unprecedented improvement" in trade with China is enough to alleviate the latter's resentment. Moreover, Baba has already stated that the tax increase will be postponed until next year. This is why all of Japan's property owners are only asking the new Finance Minister to explain the methods used to issue more public bonds.</p>
<p>However, what we should pay most attention to is not what is mentioned above, but the change in Japan's investment policy towards Manchuria. Japanese capitalists, because of the accusation of "the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) serving the army," have used Takahashi's passive policy to promote the reflection of the Kwantung Army. As a result, not only could many important factories not start operations, and Mantetsu's capital increase became empty talk on paper, but also the Xingzhong Company, which the military wanted to make a second Mantetsu, fell into a state of inability to progress. Now, the Japanese government is reversing what Takahashi did, allowing capital to flow into Manchuria. This will not only promote the industrialization of the three eastern provinces, but also intensify economic aggression against China under the command of Shingo Tenkawa. Economic aggression cannot be separated from military force. Military actions may also inevitably become more intense. Under the pincer attack of these two powerful weapons—economy and military—China's national capital will be declared dead through oppression and exclusion. China's national economy will accelerate its bankruptcy. Can we not hurry to seek ways to save ourselves?</p>

<h3>Hirota Plans to Adopt an Aggressive Policy, Striving to Resolve Various Outstanding Issues, First Demanding that Soviet Russia Withdraw Troops from the Far East, Terauchi Also Instructs Ueda, Commander of the Kwantung Army, to Govern and Control the Pseudo-State</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The French, American, and Russian Ambassadors to Japan congratulated Prime Minister Hirota yesterday on the formation of the cabinet. Reports say that Hirota stated when talking to the three ambassadors that there had been no change in Japan's foreign policy. Japan intends to change its previous passive approach and adopt a more aggressive approach to a certain extent to seek solutions to various outstanding foreign issues. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The general outline of Hirota's cabinet's new policy was decided on the 13th. After being copied by Yoshida, the Director-General of the Investigation Bureau, it will be formally decided at the cabinet meeting on the 17th and announced to China and foreign countries immediately. The government is now considering using wireless telephone to broadcast its content, reporting to the people. (14th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported that Hirota and Russian Ambassador Yurenev discussed the concentration of Russian troops in eastern Xinjiang today. Hirota asked the Russian Ambassador to pay attention to this matter and stated that the tense situation in the Far East could not be clarified unless the Russian troops withdrew. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Land Minister Terauchi, who is currently also the Director-General of the Affairs Bureau for Manchuria, is determined to adopt an aggressive policy towards Manchuria. He has already declared the fundamental policy towards Manchuria to Ueda, the newly appointed Ambassador to Manchuria and Commander of the Kwantung Army, and demanded that he implement the major task with a serious attitude. Therefore, General Ueda will actively implement the policy towards Manchuria after the end of the current state of day defense on the state security station at the end of this month. (14th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The new Commander of the Kwantung Army and Ambassador to Manchuria met with Hirota, the concurrently serving Foreign Minister, and received instructions on his mission in Manchuria. He exchanged opinions on the adjustment of the two Manchurian-Soviet and Manchurian-Mongolian borders, the abolition of extraterritoriality in Manchuria, and other matters, for up to one hour.

The main purpose of this is to smoothly supply industrial salt to Japan and Manchuria. (14th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Discusses Four Major Policies</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Hirota informed the three chiefs that they would not attend the cabinet meeting. After Land Minister Terauchi took office, he convened a top-level military meeting for several days to discuss the issue of invigorating military discipline and refreshing the military appearance. At the same time, they studied the methods for realizing the four major national policies of the army. Because the army believes that enriching the national defense plan is the most urgent, they are now producing specific countermeasures based on the plan of the General Staff Headquarters. However, the budget案 submitted to the special parliament cannot be decided again due to its imminent timing. It was decided to implement the strengthening of military appearance and enrich the troops stationed in Manchuria with the budget decided by Land Minister Kawashima. As for the expansion of the troops stationed in China and the funding for enriching military preparations in Outer Mongolia, the funding for enriching military preparations in response to the situation in these two aspects should be submitted to the special parliament as an additional budget for approval because the situation in these areas has changed greatly from that time. (14th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Since the formation of the government, it has been anxious to decide on policies and political programs. On the one hand, the issue of setting up a full-time Minister of Education and other important political affairs, such as parliament tactics, are piled up. However, Prime Minister Hirota broke the precedents, regarding the cabinet meeting as a meeting of cabinet members. The so-called secretaries-general, legislative bureau directors, and investigation bureau directors of the three government chiefs have always been regarded as important political affairs officials and have always attended the cabinet meetings. However, from now on, it will be announced that they should not enter or leave the cabinet room unless it is absolutely necessary.

<h3>Negotiations on the Jinchan Gou Incident Proceed in Moscow, Aiming at Joint Investigation, Japan Aims at Boundary Demarcation, Japanese Army Shoots at Russian Workers Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese and Russian authorities are now negotiating the Jinchan Gou incident in Moscow. The Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs submitted a concrete proposal to the Japanese Ambassador in Beijing on the 9th. It has now arrived at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the Russian side, the Jinchan Gou incident will be limited to investigating the facts. However, the Japanese side believes that this incident occurred due to unclear borders. Therefore, in addition to establishing an investigation committee, it is advocated to establish a border determination committee as a fundamental and important issue. After the European and Asian Bureau studies countermeasures, negotiations will be conducted in accordance with this policy. (14th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Moscow: Soviet officials announced today that the tense situation in Western Europe caused by Germany's occupation of the Rhineland has now spread to the Far East. The troops of Japan and "Manchukuo" are now invading the border of Siberia again. According to a report from Boli, a team of Japanese and Manchurian troops driving cars opened fire on workers in Soviet Russia along the Heilongjiang River, firing 30 shots. This act is clearly a malicious provocation. In addition, five Japanese soldiers crossed the Soviet border after the Russian workers withdrew and inspected the holes dug by the workers. (13th National Electric dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a report from Boli on March 5, a team of workers from the Heilongjiang State Navigation Bureau was dredging the Heilongjiang River 3 kilometers south of the village of Ikatiteli Nikusk, 350 meters from the Soviet riverbank, when they were suddenly shot at by Japanese and Manchurian troops driving cars along the Manchurian border. They fired 30 shots, and the workers were forced to flee to the riverbank. After the shooting, five Japanese and Manchurian soldiers left the car, crossed the border on the ice, and went to the work place to inspect, and then returned to their car. This decision to fire was a provocative nature and was obvious, because the river opening work was carried out near the Soviet riverbank, and the Heilongjiang State Navigation Bureau had notified the Harbin River Management Office of this matter in advance, and Consul General Slavotsky also notified the Harbin diplomatic authorities of this work on January 17.

<h3>Inside Story of the Tokyo Incident, Right-Wing Masked Left-Leaning Thought, Seizure of Power by Armed Revolution, Said that the Strange Document Was Written in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Those related to the February 26 Incident on the civilian side who were reported by the authorities after the incident included Kita Ikki and Nishida Mitsugi, who had been a cavalry lieutenant. Recently, the Tokyo Guard and the Metropolitan Police Department have been conducting rigorous investigations day and night, and have obtained victory. The two people's ideological background is also the mastermind of this case, and they are manipulating some young officers. Kita Ikki is responsible for the writing aspect, and Nishida Mitsugi is responsible for the publishing name. There is a book called "Japan Reconstruction Law Proposal", which is more than enough to prove this on this book. This book was written by Mr. Kita in Shanghai in August of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919). Later, he absconded and decided to go to the Internet. That is, the so-called strange document was secretly published. The content pointed out the defects in the current Japanese political economy, etc., and described the specific plan to eliminate the abuses. Regarding this point, it can be seen at a glance that it has the intention of anesthetizing some people who care about national reconstruction. The fundamental thought is left-leaning thought. According to this masked thought, they carry out direct action demonstrations in order to gain power. In order to achieve this goal, they collude with the army, interfere with the supreme command, and want to turn the sacred imperial army into private soldiers. Using this means, they advocate the so-called armed revolution. The authorities believe that this decision incident contains a serious nature, and they are conducting careful investigations and interrogations with an extremely cautious attitude. The gendarmerie and the Metropolitan Police Department are working together to pay special attention to the thoughts of the aforementioned background related persons. (14th Domei dispatch)</p>

<h3>Random Notes from Sichuan Travel</h3>
<p>— Record of Difficulties</p>
<p>1.  "The Three Gorges Are the Most Dangerous Place Under Heaven"</p>
<p>"The Jian Pavilion is the most magnificent place under heaven, Mount Emei is the most beautiful place under heaven, and the Three Gorges are the most dangerous place under heaven." These three sentences are often said loudly by people from Sichuan, just like people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang saying, "Above, there is paradise; below, there are Suzhou and Hangzhou." The so-called Three Gorges are the Xiling Gorge, the Wu Gorge, and the Qutang Gorge. The great river, from the interior of Sichuan, converges the Min River, Tuo River, Jialing River, Wujiang River, and large and small tributaries of the Kai River, cascading down. Reaching Fengjie, it is tightly bound by hundreds of miles of steep cliffs, forming the danger of the Three Gorges. Geologically speaking, the formation of the Three Gorges is due to the great river above Yichang rising, but the speed of the rise is not as fast as the speed of the river's erosion. The valley floor is eroded, but the height remains unchanged, thus becoming a gorge. There are many reefs and shallow waters in between, and the dangers of navigation have long been recorded in history. In the past, when steamships were not available, the transportation of passengers and goods relied solely on wooden boats. Going downstream could be done with the current, but going upstream required the use of trackers, making every step difficult. The trackers, with calloused hands and feet, crawled like cattle and horses. If they encountered steep cliffs with no place for their hands and feet to grip, they had to anchor and wait for a favorable wind to move forward. Therefore, in the past, it often took months to travel from Yichang to Chongqing, and danger was present at all times and in all places.</p>
<p>In 1899, on March 9th, the arrival of Mr. Archibald Little's small steamship "Lichuan" in Chongqing heralded the success of the trial navigation of the Sichuan River. Later, Mr. Little hired expert Mr. C.S. Plant to Sichuan to measure the river's reefs, install buoys, and markers, making navigation safer. Therefore, now our transport ships can travel freely in the Sichuan River.</p>
<p>The Xiling Gorge spans the Zigui and Badong counties of Hubei. Due to the fantastical mountain scenery, it is further divided into the Huangniu Gorge, Niuganmafei Gorge, and Bingshubaojian Gorge. The gorge has many dangerous rapids, and the Kongling, Xintan, and Xietan are considered the three major dangers in the gorge. The Huangniu Gorge has winding river currents, with barren mountains, resembling a shepherd riding an ox, with black people and yellow oxen. An ancient saying goes, "See the Yellow Ox in the morning, see the Yellow Ox in the evening; three mornings and three evenings, the Yellow Ox remains the same." One can imagine the hardship of traveling by boat at that time. After entering the Niuganmafei Gorge, the first pass is Kongling. The mountains are higher, and the gorge is more dangerous. At the bend of the river, a large rock of several tens of feet suddenly emerges from the river, dividing the water flow into two channels. The southern channel is blocked by chaotic rocks and is impassable for boats. The northern channel has three hidden reefs, arranged in a character formation, barely allowing a small boat to pass. When a steamship passes, it must zigzag to avoid them. A slight oversight will immediately cause it to run aground. Therefore, boatmen have a saying, "Xintan and Xietan don't count as rapids; Kongling is the gate of hell." Passing this "gate of hell," one sees two hanging stalactites on the cliff on the north bank, one with a sharp outline like a liver, and the other with a round and blunt shape like a lung. The Niuganmafei Gorge gets its name from this.</p>
<p>The Bingshubaojian Gorge is also known as Micang Gorge. The sheer cliffs reach the sky and are completely perpendicular to the water surface. The ridges are white and devoid of vegetation. The mountain on the north bank is the most sheer, while the south bank is relatively flat. Xintan is a short stretch from the Niuganmafei Gorge to here. The slope of Xintan is extremely steep, like a mountain peak submerged in the water, with chaotic rocks across the river, making it extremely difficult to ascend. The river width is narrow, and the water storage is like a gate, rushing down with the force of a waterfall. When a steamship passes here, even if it opens up full engine power and rushes upwards, it is still pushed back. At this time, one can only use tracking. Tracking is a profession that the local residents rely on for a living. The leader shouts from a high place, and in an instant, hundreds of people, men, women, old, and young, gather. They climb onto the ship's iron cables, shout and pull, and then wind the other end into the winch at the bow of the ship, which gains momentum and ascends.</p>
<p>After passing the Bingshu Jian Gorge, the Xiling Gorge comes to an end. The river surface suddenly opens up, and the mountain scenery becomes more gentle. Even if there are occasional towering peaks, they are vastly different from the steep cliffs in the gorge.</p>
<p>Passing Badong County, one enters the Wu Gorge in Sichuan. The weather in the gorge is unpredictable, changing in an instant, with deep clouds and dark caves, dense grass and cold mountains, and continuous peaks and cliffs on both banks. The morning mist covers the mountains, and the peaks are covered with snow, shining like the Milky Way. The river flow is still gentle, but it is said to be extremely dangerous during floods. The strange peaks on the north bank rise in competition, making them the most steep and beautiful, leaving people with too much to take in. The moss on the cliffs has strange patterns like embroidery, creating an ancient and verdant color. Looking up at the sky, there is only a line of light, and the air is filled with yin energy. The surrounding scenery changes in an instant. The boat travels among thousands of mountains, not knowing where it came from, truly reaching the realm of "mountains piled upon mountains and rivers upon rivers, one doubts there is no road ahead."</p>
<p>Mount Wu has twelve peaks: Wangxia, Cuiping, Chaoyun (i.e., Goddess Peak), Songluan, Jixian, Juhe, Futan, Shangsheng, Qiyun, Feifeng, Denglong, and Shengquan. In the river, one can only see the overlapping peaks and cannot identify them. Presumably, they all resemble their names. Only the Goddess Peak stands next to the two sharp peaks, resembling a human figure. In the verdant mountains, looking up at this delicate mountain peak, it seems to be the misty hair of the goddess. No wonder the story of the goddess is also the most poetic myth in our country. At the end of the Wu Gorge is Wu Mountain County. The county seat is located below Yangtai, which is the Yangyun Terrace with morning clouds and evening rain in Song Yu's High Tang Rhapsody. Lying in the boat at night, I wonder if the goddess will come into my dreams?</p>
<p>The next day, we entered Qutang Gorge. The flying rocks and protruding cliffs are extremely dangerous. The stone colors are cyan, yellow, red, and black, intermingling with the trees, forming an exceptionally magnificent picture. Collapsing cliffs and splitting rocks, standing thousands of feet high, seem to be the work of knives and axes. Some say they are the relics of Dayu opening up the gorge. Looking up at the sky, it is like a white silk, "the sky is narrow and the walls are cut," which can be called an absolute verse. At the mouth of the gorge, the mountain range is continuous and interrupted like a cut. The two walls are separated like a door, hence the name Kuimen. In the middle of the stream, slightly north of the entrance, stands a large rock, which is the Yongyu Pile. The pile is more than ten feet in circumference and several tens of feet high. It is said that during floods, it is the center of the vortex, making navigation extremely dangerous. The Baidi City, where Zhaolie entrusted his orphans, is located on a small mountain on the side of the pile. The city walls follow the mountain, hidden in the desolate smoke and weeds. Upstream is Fengjie County, the ancient Kui Kingdom. Yufu Wharf is located to its east, with the Eight Trigrams Formation left by Marquis Wu. Looking from the boat, there are only a few piles of chaotic rocks, with no magical features to be seen. It is said that the formation map is the principle of the army's movements, perhaps a later addition.</p>
<p>Above Kuimen, the scenery opens up. The seven hundred li of the Three Gorges have been completely traversed. Among them, the Xiling walls are like white bones, making it the most secluded. The Wu Mountains are verdant and unmatched in their steep beauty. The Qutang has many red cliffs, superior in their magnificent grandeur. Looking back from the exit of the gorge, the quick peaks reach the sky, and the mountains are clustered together. Recalling the dangers, it is like experiencing a ghost country. Poetic and picturesque, all of this is contained here.</p>
<p>From Fengjie to Chongqing, the mountains are flat, and the stone color is ochre yellow, unlike the cyan and black in the gorge. The shadows of clouds and mountains, sailing boats and sand birds, compared to the strange peaks and exotic rocks in the gorge, which are shocking, are not worth mentioning. However, there are hidden reefs and shallow shoals everywhere in the river, so there are still many dangerous rapids. Such as the Xinlongtan between Yunyang and Wanxian, the Hutan between Wanxian and Zhongxian, and the Guanyintan between Fengdu and Fuzhou, all of which are passed by tracking.</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the Guangdong Provincial authorities, in view of the increasing import of foreign cigarettes and the large outflow of money, have been promoting local tobacco leaves and improving tobacco varieties in order to establish factories to manufacture cigarettes. They had previously sent personnel to foreign countries to inspect tobacco varieties and cigarette manufacturing methods. Recently, they investigated that there are 23 counties in the province that produce tobacco leaves, with Heshan and Nanxiong being the largest, followed by Qingyuan, Maoming, Xinyu, and other 20 counties, which also have large outputs. The Fujian-Guangdong-Guangxi Three Provinces Unified Tobacco Tax Bureau drafted measures to implement government monopoly of local tobacco leaves in the entire province. The implementation of this method can increase tax revenue by 2 million yuan annually. All regulations for setting up specialized sales points have been approved by the government and were announced by the Unified Tax Bureau on the 5th of this month. Personnel were immediately dispatched to establish local tobacco leaf specialty sales offices and distribution points to handle the affairs of specialty sales. The regulations for the specialty sales of local tobacco leaves are recorded below: "Article 1: The Guangdong Province implements specialty sales measures for local tobacco leaves to protect the interests of tobacco farmers and ensure national tax revenue. Article 2: Tobacco farmers in the province should, after drying the tobacco leaves harvested each year, deliver all of them to the government within a certain period of time. The government will negotiate an appropriate purchase price with reference to the selling price in the producing area in recent years. (Article 3: Tobacco leaves transported from other provinces for the exclusive use of manufacturing local tobacco shreds will be purchased by the government at any time according to the sales volume in recent years. After the quota is full, imports may be restricted. Article 4: The specialty sales price of local [  ] leaves includes the tobacco leaf tax. The original levy of local tobacco leaves and local tobacco shred tax should be stopped on the date of implementation of these regulations, but the unsold tobacco leaves stored in each tobacco shred shop should be checked and registered to calculate the quantity of tobacco shreds that should be scraped and taxed according to the original local tobacco shred tax rate within a fixed period. Article 5: For local tobacco shreds transported to foreign countries for sale, a portion of the local tobacco shred tax included in the specialty sales price of local tobacco leaves should be refunded to show encouragement. The amount and method of the aforementioned tax refund will be determined separately. Article 6: Tobacco shreds transported into the province from other provinces will still be taxed separately for local tobacco shred tax, production and sales tax, and transit tax according to the original regulations, and will be handled according to the original tax collection procedures. Article 7: Tobacco leaves transported into the province for re-export will still be taxed according to the original regulations, and will be handled according to the original inspection and punishment regulations. Article 8: Tobacco paste transported into the province from Hong Kong, Macao, and other ports will still be taxed for tobacco paste tax according to the original regulations. Article 9: The local tobacco chestnuts sold under the specialty sales system will be freely purchased and sold by merchants, and they can freely manufacture and sell tobacco shreds without applying for a business license or a tobacco manufacturing and sales license. All previous penalties for illegal transportation, manufacturing, and sales of tobacco are abolished. Article 10: Local tobacco specialty purchasing offices will be set up in tobacco producing areas to manage the purchase and sale of local tobacco leaves, and may be attached to various stamp tobacco and alcohol tax collection offices or sub-offices to handle them jointly as appropriate. Article 11: Local tobacco leaf specialty sales distribution points will be set up in areas with more tobacco sales to manage the sale of local tobacco leaves. In places with fewer [  ] sales and existing tobacco leaf trading houses, they may be attached to various stamp tobacco and alcohol tax collection offices or tax collection sub-offices to handle them jointly. Article 12: The specialty purchasing offices and specialty sales distribution points may solicit merchants to undertake the sale of local tobacco leaves and pay commissions. The merchants undertaking the sale should sell at the price set by the government and must not increase it privately. Violators will be severely punished. Article 13: After the implementation of the specialty sales of local tobacco leaves, no one is allowed to buy tobacco leaves privately from tobacco farmers. Violators will be fined ten to thirty times the value of the tobacco leaves purchased. If they buy from private sellers or people who privately store tobacco leaves, in addition to confiscating the tobacco leaves, the seller and buyer should each be fined ten to thirty times the value of the tobacco leaves according to this article. Article 14: If tobacco leaves are transported from other provinces without reporting to the local specialty sales or specialty sales distribution points for purchase and are sold privately, in addition to confiscating all the tobacco leaves, the buyer and seller will be punished according to the previous article. Article 15: Anyone can report private purchases of tobacco leaves, and the informer will be given a reward of 50% of the fine. Article 16: The detailed rules for the implementation of these regulations should be drafted separately by each specialty purchasing office and specialty sales distribution point with reference to the local customs of buying and selling local tobacco leaves and submitted for approval and implementation. Article 17: These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered. Article 18: These regulations will be implemented from the date of promulgation." It is understood that after the government took over the specialty [   ] of local tobacco leaves, the standard for establishing specialty purchasing offices is based on the amount of tobacco leaves collected annually in each county, which is divided into grades. Those that collect more than 100,000 dan (each dan is 100 catties) of tobacco leaves annually will set up a first-class specialty purchasing office, those that collect more than 40,000 dan will set up a second-class office, those that collect more than 10,000 dan will set up a third-class office, those that collect more than 4,000 dan will set up a fourth-class office, those that collect more than 1,000 dan will set up a fifth-class office, and those that collect less than 1,000 dan will be classified as a sixth-class office. According to the investigation, the annual sales volume of tobacco leaves in this province is 429,193 dan in total. (March 8th)</p>

<h3>He Jian from Hubei and Hunan</h3>
<p>He Speaks Bitterly Denouncing the Communist Bandits for Harming the Nation</p>
<p>China Needs Young People Who Devote Themselves to Study</p>
<p>Simplified Characters are an Obstacle to Cultural Education</p>
<p>Advocates Studying the Classics to Enhance the Glory of Culture</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, went to Hubei last week to attend the Three-Province Communist Suppression Conference and returned to Changsha the day before yesterday. According to He, "During this trip to Hubei, I discussed the suppression of the communist bandits in the three provinces with Yang Yongtai, Xiong Shihui, He Chengjun, etc., and I had many feelings. The more important ones are: Among the young people across the country, there are still some who are inevitably confused by the mystical ideas of communism, thinking that the Communist Party is seeking a happy way out for the people. They do not know that the Chinese Communist Party is a bandit, using a few slogans to deceive the common people into becoming their sacrificial tools. The Communist Party is actually a traitor and a seller of the country. The real way to seek a happy way out for the people is not to rely on empty talk and the bandit behavior of the Communist Party, but to rely on scientists and scholars to cultivate the people's knowledge and ability, and to develop agriculture, industry, and commerce. If the Chinese people still believe in foreign empty talk, doctrines, and isms, and do not do practical work, they are digging their own graves. More and more people are going to Russia to travel, and the inside story of Russia is not as mysterious as it used to be, so we also know that the Chinese Communist Party absolutely does not have the knowledge and ability to cultivate the Soviet Russian Communist Party. They are just ignorant, lazy, and floating young people, just spies who want to sell the Chinese people to foreign countries. Domestically, there are still some who want to use the Communist bandits. It is the biggest mistake for us to use leftist young people or Communist bandits. Although they seem to have the vigor of hard work and endurance, they are absolutely not capable of construction and have no scholarly cultivation. If we use them for a while, it will cause endless harm. I hope that people across the country will deeply study and consider this. China needs young people with specialized knowledge and technology, young people who devote themselves to study. Those frivolous people who want to abandon Chinese characters, do not understand Chinese history, and do not read Chinese books, although they call themselves leftists, are actually laughed at by the real Russian Communist Party members. Soviet Russia has never had a movement to abolish Russian characters, nor has there been a movement to not read their own country's books and only want to turn Russia into a foreign country. They only develop their own country's culture, science, and industry and commerce. They only devote themselves to the work of building light and heavy industries. We must not use leftist-thinking, frivolous young people and Communist bandits. The above two points are the sincere knowledge that I hope people across the country will have. The three provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei have suffered the most from the Communist bandits' trampling, and have gained more experience. I believe that in the future, to seek a happy way out for the people, we must popularize people's education, develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, and cultivate people's specialized skills, so that everyone has the ability to make a living independently," and so on. He also believes that cooperation in the future of the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi is necessary. He concluded by saying that the reasons why he opposes the promotion of simplified characters are: even if phonetic symbols are promoted for many years, there are very few people who are literate and recognize phonetic symbols, and they still do not rely on phonetic symbols to increase literacy, and they feel that it is an extra burden, like drawing legs on a snake. Everyone feels the inconvenience of phonetic symbols, and now they are advocating simplified characters that illiterate people or lazy people write wrong or abbreviate, which is actually an obstacle to cultural education. As for advocating the reading of classics, it is because the Four Books and Five Classics are the sacred texts that enable Chinese culture to grow. Ancient Chinese cultural relics and systems must be studied from these books. Those who call themselves new scholars use the name of scientific methods to study the classics, but in reality, they destroy Chinese culture and history. If we use scientific methods to develop the treasures in the classics, increase the glory of Chinese culture and history, and make proper contributions to the knowledge community, this is what we should approve of.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Xu Composes a Poem on the Boat</h3>
<p>Entitled "Leaving Beijing and Shanghai Friends on the Way East"</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: Xu Shiying, our country's newly appointed ambassador to Japan, departed from the country on the Japanese ship Asama Maru on the morning of the 7th, and arrived in Kobe on the 9th. He then transferred by train directly to Tokyo and arrived at his post on the morning of the 10th. While on the Asama Maru, Xu personally wrote a five-character律詩 (lǜshī) poem, entitled "Leaving Beijing and Shanghai Friends on the Way East." The original poem is as follows: "Beginning to state the traveler's duty, traveling east is the beginning of my official career. When sent to Qi, I think of Yanzi, when returning to Zhao, I recall Xiangru. Gradually aging, my body is still healthy, neighboring countries should have honest intentions. The sentiment of Peach Blossom Pool, respectfully send a fish letter." (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Machine Shop Burned Down</h3>
<p>The car factory and warehouse were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The Ping City Fire Brigade Rushed to Put Out the Fire</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Changxindian in Pingxi is the hub of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The offices of the machine section, car section, and construction section of the northern section of the railway are all located there, as well as the machine factory, car factory, material factory, and warehouses of each factory, which are the essence of the northern section of the railway. At 10:00 a.m. today (the 13th), a fire suddenly broke out in the office of the machine section of Sanhe Village behind Tushan, west of Changxindian Railway Station. The local fire brigade rushed to put out the fire, but because the fire was too large and the wind was very strong, it spread to the machine factory and the warehouse of the car factory. Important mechanical drawings, forms, registers, and all important documents were all reduced to ashes. The car factory and material factory were also in imminent danger. The Pinghan Railway Office in Beiping telegraphed the Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau to send a fire brigade to assist. The Railway Bureau also prepared a special train for them to ride. Upon receiving the news, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched the first and fourth fire brigades, led by Captains Xu Yinda and He Songhai, and carrying full firefighting equipment. At 12:35, they boarded the special train to go. The Railway Bureau also stipulated that the special train must arrive within 30 minutes, and must not stop along the way. The fire brigade arrived at 1:05 and immediately helped to put out the fire. As of 2:00 p.m., the strong wind had not subsided, and the losses were extremely heavy. Yan Xichuan, the Chief of the Car Section, and a Mr. Yu, the Chief of the Police Section, both of the Railway Bureau's Ping office, had gone. At 2:00 p.m., the Ping office also sent staff to take care of the situation. (13th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Garrison Encircle and Suppress Remnant Bandits in the Anhui-Jiangxi Border Area</h3>
<p>Several Important Bandit Criminals Captured</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The remnant bandits in Yining, Jingxian, and other counties in southern Anhui have been repeatedly and severely suppressed by the garrison and security teams. Because they have nowhere to stay, they have fled in droves. Now, a part of them have fled to the Anhui-Jiangxi border area and joined forces with scattered bandits there, attempting to seize the opportunity to cause trouble. Recently, about 200 people from the pseudo-independent battalion of Xiong Jiang and the pseudo-special agent team of a Mr. Li joined forces in the old nest of Zhanggong Mountain in Huizhou, and then fled to Hengkeng near Wang Village in Xiuning. Upon receiving the report, Bao Brigade of the garrison immediately dispatched Liu Battalion and Hao Company to pursue and suppress them. They made contact with the bandits near Hengkeng. The bandits stubbornly resisted from the high mountains. Hao Company fought bravely, followed by hand-to-hand combat. Battalion Commander Liu also led Shi Company to rush to reinforce the defense. The bandits could not hold out and fled towards Guoguang Mountain. The bandits suffered heavy losses in this battle, and there were many casualties. Eleven bandit corpses and more than ten guns were seized. The next day, because Battalion Commander Liu's pressure was too great, the bandits fled from Guoguang Mountain through Yuantou to 　Xi. Just then, Regiment Commander Zhang of Bao Brigade rushed to the scene from Tunxi, and made contact with the bandits between 　Xi and 　Dian. The bandits resisted from the high mountains, and after three hours of fierce fighting, six bandits were killed, nine were captured, and countless were wounded. Many guns were also seized. Regiment Commander Zhang personally supervised the suppression, taking the lead. They then occupied the high mountains near 　Xi. The bandits could not hold out and collapsed into the mountain valleys. That night, the government troops and a security team surrounded the bandits, hoping to annihilate them. Also, a few days ago, Bao Brigade cracked down on many bandit organizations and important documents in Xiuning, and captured Liao Ronghua, the pseudo-political instructor, Cheng Yingui, the director of the custody committee of the pseudo-Anhui Provincial Government, and more than ten important bandit criminals. The remnant bandits in the border area have become fish in a cauldron, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them in a short period of time. (13th)</p>
<p>West Frontier Correspondence</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Qinghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xueben</p>
<p>Gaily-dressed Song and Dance</p>
<p>The local “Daola” is very similar to the “Jumping Pot Costume” of western Sichuan, but different from the songs without dance of the Tangba Fort.</p>
<p>On the second day of our arrival, Chief Li found a group of men and women to perform Daola for us in his courtyard, and we rewarded them with wine.</p>
<p>There were men, girls, and women, who began to stand in a circle. They walked and sang, and danced, the movements of the dance were mostly raising their hands, turning around, and bowing. The movements were very fast, very similar to the small singing costumes of the Western Rong people on the Sichuan border who flirted. The tune was very short, and when one song was finished, they raised their glasses and passed them around.</p>
<p>Because they wore mostly five-colored clothes, it felt very gorgeous and interesting when they danced. The singing was also clear and melodious. The sharp tones of the women had the feeling of resounding through the clouds. But they were very scattered; the sounds were not harmonious and consistent, and the movements were not very neat. The men and women participating in the Daola entered and exited at will. This was because of their habit of being unrestrained, and it was the same disorder even during ordinary Daola.</p>
<p>Later, we translated the transliteration of a Daola song that the locals often sang and was relatively good-sounding. The name of the song was "Slon Kua Nyo." When asked about the meaning of the song, many locals could not explain it, so it could not be translated. The score was still made by Mr. Ke.</p>
<p>A Peach-Colored Night Party</p>
<p>These days are during the New Year, so it is very lively, and everyone is especially happy. They do not have swings. Throwing thread balls and kicking shuttlecocks are also common entertainment for girls and children during the day. But it is not as interesting as the evening entertainment. During the New Year, from New Year's Day to the Lantern Festival, there are many Daola and games every night during these two weeks. The participants are mostly girls and young men. There are very few married men and women, and there are absolutely no old people who are past their prime. There are especially many children joining in the fun.</p>
<p>After dinner, we also went to visit their night party every day. The location was in the Zhuangyuan under the poplar forest in front of the Zhuang. The heavy night curtain shrouded the earth, and a half-moon crescent hovered on the treetops of the poplars. Brilliant starlight looked down on this open venue. First, a few men and women who had already eaten dinner were sneaking around in the middle of the venue. The cold wind made them shiver, and everyone shouted, and loud whistles summoned many locals. Everyone picked up firewood and lit a bonfire in the corner of the venue, squeezing together, roasting, talking, and laughing. When the flames could not last and went down, one or two men and women got up and shouted Daola! Daola! Everyone heard the sound and sang and danced together, picking one or two children who were watching and standing motionless in the center as the center of their circle. After a while of random singing and dancing, pairs of men and women slipped out to talk and laugh privately in the dark. When the number of Daola people decreased, they gradually dispersed. "Ji er ha"! Suddenly one or two people shouted again, and the pairs of lovers all around shook their clothes and got up, gathered around to do the "Catching Sheep Game". Two girls were taken as the head and tail of the flock of sheep; in the middle were many men and women connected. A single man acted as the wolf. The wolf chased the tail of the sheep, and the head of the sheep came back and forth to protect her, running for a long time until the wolf caught the tail of the sheep, temporarily ending. There is also a kind of "Tulong", which is the game of "Cat and Mouse", one acts as the mouse, and one acts as the cat. The mouse ran under the arms of people in a circle holding hands, and the cat followed the route of the mouse to chase. These were all their common games.</p>
<p>In such a lively darkness, whispering sweet words between men and women and rubbing against each other were considered common. Sometimes, when a woman pretended to be unhappy, a man with a fiery temper would throw the girl on the ground and touch her indiscriminately. But most of the girls had natural feet, and also had considerable strength. Often they would unite two or three girls to play with a playful man, hugging his head and pulling his feet, cooperating with each other, throwing him on the ground, and dragging him several feet. Then, fearing his revenge, they would disperse with a shout.</p>
<p>The locals had never seen a flashlight. When we shone the flashlight on them, several ran up and wanted to blow it out, which further increased the liveliness of the night club.</p>
<p>The whispers of lovers in the corner of the venue were endless. The ruthless new moon was urging everyone to go back on the western mountains. At this time, there were those who separated and dispersed, and those who could not separate. The pink night party closed here, waiting for the new moon to be in the forest tomorrow to continue.</p>
<p>Carrying the God to Cure the Disease</p>
<p>They do not pay much attention to hygiene, and there are many diseases, and sexually transmitted diseases are also common. In addition, one-tenth of the locals have "　La" disease, with an ugly fleshy tumor growing on the neck. This symptom is very common among the Zhuang people. The Western Rong people call it "Monkey Color".</p>
<p>When the locals are sick, they do not know medicine, and mostly ask the gods to fulfill their vows.</p>
<p>One morning, I was walking in front of "Pengkang". A gong sounded in the woods. Later, I saw a local man holding the "Dharma Protector Arrow" from afar, holding the gong in one hand, and four people behind him carrying a large chair, sitting an image of a goddess. The person in front held the gong and circled out in the village, passing by "Pengkang". Suddenly, they carried the goddess upside down. They went north all the way. I followed, walking for a while. The four people carrying the chair suddenly carried the goddess and turned around randomly, After a few minutes, they were exhausted and dizzy; the poles of the chair collided randomly on the poplar trees, and the people almost fell down uncontrollably. I was simply baffled by their crazy behavior, and after a while they knocked the gong again and carried it away. Later, when I asked the locals, I knew that it was a way to invite the gods to go home to cure the disease. The goddess carried was "Nine Heavens Profound Woman Goddess" in the Zhuang Temple.</p>
<p>Language and Writing</p>
<p>The local culture is very backward; they originally only had language and no writing.</p>
<p>The language can be understood everywhere. The only differences between Tangba Fort and Sangsige are a few nouns. The local language and the Mongolian language can also be understood; a few nouns are also the same as the Qinghai Western Fan language. This is because the locals are located between the two major ethnic groups of Mongolia and Zhuang, and are influenced by the Mongolian and Tibetan languages. There are many vowels 　　　in their speech. The organization of sentences is also with the noun in front and the verb or auxiliary word in the back. For example: to eat rice, they call it "rice eat". A cow, they call it "cow one".</p>
<p>But now their local language is gradually being lost. Most men, women, old and young can speak Chinese. When they meet Chinese people, they can answer in Chinese very well. Although they still use the local language in conversations among themselves, many difficult nouns are still replaced with Chinese. Therefore, the pure local language is now only known to a few old people, and young people cannot answer when asked about it.</p>
<p>The Chinese commonly used by them, contracts and letters are mostly written in Chinese characters, but there are very few people who can read and write, except for a few villages near the county towns. Men neither farm nor study. The reason why they do not study is generally because they are lazy. Locals who are lamas mostly read Tibetan, so Tibetan is also commonly used by the locals, but Tibetan is only used in religion.</p>
<p>Quiet Temple</p>
<p>Ten miles above Sangsige is Youning Temple, which has 300 local lamas, which is certainly the largest temple among the locals. The interior is divided into five halls: Tuguan Hall, Zhangjia Hall, Songbu Hall, Quzhuang Hall, and Wang Hall. Each hall - temple - is mostly presided over by a "Hutuktu". The entire temple is the largest, presided over by the Tuguan Hutuktu of the Tuguan Hall. The current Zhangjia Hutuktu who preaches in Inner Mongolia, he is the host of Zhangjia Hall.</p>
<p>The temples are lined up in the lush cypress forest, with two high mountains in front and behind, and a stream meandering in front of the temple. The scenery is magnificent and beautiful, and the Hongyazi Gully is unparalleled.</p>
<p>The first time we rode horses, we were invited by several red-robed lamas to drink strong butter tea in the guest room. The housekeeper of Tuguan Hutuktu brought in a more Khata and a business card of "Master Miaozhi". He could not meet us because of illness. We went to visit the magnificent main hall, the gilded Buddha statues, and the large carpets protecting the pillars, which showed that the temple was wealthy. Several local women were carrying scriptures around the hall for prayer. Zhangjia Hall was below the main hall. When we went, the housekeeper went out. Pushing open the hall door seemed very small. If it were not said that it was the temple of the Zhangjia Living Buddha, everyone would mistakenly think it was an ordinary small temple. But the divine arrow enshrined in his hall is said to be the most effective protector in the entire temple. Just as we were about to go out, the housekeeper came back and asked about the Zhangjia Living Buddha, knowing that he had been out for more than twenty years.</p>
<p>There are also two temples on the rock behind the main hall. We followed the mountain path up, all the way mostly verdant cypress trees. In the depths of the shade of the trees, there were four or five pairs of "Magou" that looked like peacocks without long tails, hopping around in the woods picking food. They were not frightened or avoided when they saw us. Just as we were about to take a photo, a gray-haired roe deer suddenly窜 (cuàn) down from the rock in front,绕 (rào)ed past our feet, and ran into the deep forest. Such a fluttering feeling really had a non-worldly impression. From here, there were only a few steps to the two quiet temples. This is the meditation room of the Tuguan Living Buddha sitting by the well. The interior is very simple. Leaning on the window railing, there is a natural painting of the vast sky and white clouds, distant mountains and nearby water. Arriving at this realm, everyone has thoughts of leaving the world.</p>
<p>The temple is located at the mouth of the mountain. In the afternoon, a strong wind arose, blowing yellow sand and stones onto our faces, so we immediately spurred our horses and returned.</p>
<p>Local Community Worship</p>
<p>The second time we came to the temple was on the day of the god dance on the eighth day of the first lunar month. The temple holds a community worship every year on the eighth day of the first lunar month. That morning, many locals in new clothes came to the fair. A few Mongols and Fan people from nearby also came.</p>
<p>When we arrived, the area in front of the main hall was already surrounded by a sea of people. Three hundred red-robed lamas were seated in the square chanting scriptures. A Songbu Living Buddha in his teens was being crowded by several abbots - Kanbu - on a large chair facing north. Seven or eight goblins dressed as god dancers were using red sticks to maintain order in the crowd. People who mistakenly stepped into the circle of lines would be rewarded with goblin sticks.</p>
<p>After the lamas finished chanting the scriptures, a lama holding the Dharma Protector Arrow walked down the field from the main hall. He 　hand touched the divine arrow again, and his neck was tightly bound with a Khata. A group of lamas simmered cypress branches and smoked his whole body, and then chanted scriptures at him in bursts. The lama who was channeling became more and more trembling, getting more and more intense until he could not support himself. Four lamas raised a plate of 綹粑 (liǔbā) - fried noodles - in front of him; he supported the divine arrow that shook well, dipped the 　head in the 綹粑, and a lama went to predict the harvest of the crops this year.</p>
<p>God dance - began next. First, dozens of担 (dàn) of steamed buns were piled up in the 　; a burst of wooing Wang 筒 (tǒng) sound blew out from the hall, followed by the lama wearing a yellow cockscomb hat walking down the hall. Suona drum beat non-stop, four white skeleton Gol went down the stone steps, circling the 　堆 (duī) and dancing, advancing and retreating with the sound of drums and cymbals. After half an hour, thirteen people wearing dragon robes, holding human skull shells in their left hands and Khata in their right hands, 　, came down to dance around the 　, after a long time, the gong gradually stopped and the dancers entered the hall.</p>
<p>Suddenly the order in the 　was in great chaos. The general poor spectators rushed to the 　block to grab the 　, in less than a few minutes, the 　pile was emptied by the locals. This is a scene where the temple gives alms to the poor.</p>
<p>After order was restored, dozens of new 　were piled up in the 　again. The sound of drums and cymbals was heard again, and seventeen Gikuja with bull-headed and horse-faced faces came out of the hall to dance. As the drum sound tightened, a Lamsli with a fierce face and flags inserted on his back came down to join. Then a deer-headed Sha came running and jumping like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>We were preparing to return to Xining tomorrow, so we left without finishing the 　, but their community worship soon ended.</p>

<h3>Kunshan: Barbershop Stealing Electricity Discovered</h3>
<p>Gu Fu Ji barbershop, located in the first district of the county, east gate, previously applied to Tai Ji Electric Company for the installation of electric lights. Unexpectedly, the shop recently bypassed the electricity meter with its wiring, damaging the wiring outside the meter and secretly stealing electricity, modifying five 40-watt and 25-watt light bulbs.

<h3>Suzhou: Women in Relief Homes</h3>
<p>Anti-Gas and Rescue Training</p>
<p>The Wu County Relief Home, under provincial orders, is training women in its affiliated Women's Education Center in anti-gas and rescue work to meet the needs. The training period is half a month, and the training locations are the County Hospital and the Opium Addiction Treatment Center. Classes began on March 9, with a total of twenty-three women being trained. On the 14th, the county government received another order from the province, instructing them to conduct serious training so that the province could send personnel to Suzhou for inspection in the future.</p>
<h3>Social Education Institutions to Close Today</h3>
<p>The Wu County Education Bureau previously received an order from the Education Department to temporarily suspend all social education institutions under the county's jurisdiction in order to implement civic training. After receiving the order, Director Peng notified the heads of the social education institutions, allowing them to close completely by today (the 15th), and dispatched county supervisors Feng Boyan and Xia Danchu to take over and keep custody of the properties separately. The staff of the social education institutions will go to the province for training, and after the training period, they will serve as principals of central primary schools, guiding civic training. However, the social education personnel, in view of the suspension of social education institutions, the suspension of salaries during the training period in the province, which is a matter of livelihood, specially joined with social education personnel from Wu Jiang, Kunshan, Changshu, Changzhou, and other eight counties to hold a joint meeting at the Wuxi County Education Association yesterday (the 14th) to discuss solutions. They planned to petition the Provincial Education Department to request that salaries be paid as usual during the training period to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<h3>Sujia Railway Project Nears Completion</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is actively constructing the Sujia Railway. The roadbed construction has been completed, and the tracks are now being laid. It is expected to be completed in about two months. As late as June of this year, the Sujia Railway will be open to traffic. The Wu County Construction Bureau, in order to facilitate passengers since the Sujia Railway terminal is located outside Fengmen, decided to open Xiangmen at the Lion's Mouth area at the boundary of Fengmen. It submitted the planned budget to the Construction Department for filing yesterday. Once approved, bidding will begin.</p>
<h3>Provincial Department Resolutely Collects Business Tax Directly</h3>
<p>The Wu County Business Tax Collection Bureau changed the collection method and implemented direct collection by household. The business community in Suzhou expressed opposition, insisting that the tax payments should still be paid by each store to their respective trade associations, which would then be submitted to the County Chamber of Commerce for transfer to the tax bureau, as in the past. It is learned that Feng Zhenya, director of the Business Tax Bureau, personally went to the province to meet with the Director of the Finance Department to ask for instructions on this matter. On the 13th, he had already returned to Suzhou. According to Feng, the province believes that the previous collection of Wu County business tax by the trade associations was manipulated by wealthy merchants who sheltered merchants and underpaid taxes. At this time of tax consolidation, it is urgent to reform it, and the bureau should directly collect taxes by household. On one hand, the Finance Department ordered the Wu County Government to order the Public Security Bureau to provide effective assistance. Judging from this, the official department has made a firm decision to collect taxes directly, but the merchants of various industries are still dissatisfied. The County Chamber of Commerce will convene representatives of various industries in the coming days to discuss everything.</p>

In the end, he reviewed seven administrative affairs and dismissed the meeting. It is learned that Chen will proceed with the second step of summoning Bao chiefs for instructions, but because of the large number of people, it is inconvenient to travel back and forth. It was decided to hold meetings in different districts. It has been determined that County Magistrate will begin going to the townships on the 18th of this month to give instructions and inspect the townships.</p>
<h3>Security Team Captures Major Bandits</h3>
<p>The second squadron of the County Security Team captured two major bandits, Zhang Axiang and Ping Fu Bao, near Zhang Jing, Xin'an Town, yesterday. Zhang once tried to escape by jumping into the river, but was captured by those who went into the water. It is reported that bandit Zhang was originally a local rascal, feared by the villagers like a tiger. He had previously robbed Pan Yueqiao and the Li and Pan families, and had raped Ms. Wu, the granddaughter-in-law of the Pan family, with four other bandits. He was truly an accumulated bandit who had done many evils. He has now been escorted to the team headquarters in the city.</p>
<h3>Appeal of Civil Education Personnel</h3>
<p>The social education institutions here have now all closed on the 15th. Personnel were sent by the bureau to take over and keep custody. All the former responsible personnel went to the province for training, but all living expenses have been suspended, so the social education personnel are very panicked, and they have requested that the original salaries still be paid, but the bureau has no way to deal with it. This county has already designated Jiang Sheng, Zhang Huaiqing, etc. to go to Wuxi to participate in the joint appeal meeting of various counties to seek a solution, otherwise they will not go for training.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Female Teacher in Love with Male Student</h3>

Ten years ago, after his first wife died of illness, he remarried Lu Qiangfen (35 years old), the daughter of Lu Mingshu of Guanqian Street in this city, as his successor. Qiangfen graduated from a certain girls' middle school in the city and has been a teacher at Tangwan Primary School in Tangjiawan, Lao Ximen, Shanghai. At first, the couple's relationship was quite harmonious, and they had six children. Recently, she is pregnant again, with a big belly. However, she has always been romantic, and she actually fell in love with student Chen Lin (19 years old, from Shanghai, now graduated and left school), practicing teacher-student love. The other day, Lu Qiangfen and Chen Lin came to Wuxi together and secretly met in Room 33 of the Shenjiang Hotel on Tonghui Road. This was discovered by her husband, Sun Zhonghao, who reported it to the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which sent police to catch the adultery. Chen and Lu were arrested and taken to the bureau. According to Chen Lin, he borrowed English books from Lu Qiangfen, and there was no adultery. Qiangfen also did not admit to adultery with Chen Lin. The director of the Duan sub-bureau prepared a document and transferred them to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Yesterday, they were transferred to the local court, and after an interrogation by Prosecutor Shen, he ordered Sun Zhonghao to be sent back home. Chen Lin and Lu Qiangfen were detained to await further handling.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang: Serial Guarantees for Civil Servants</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to ensure that all civil servants of the affiliated departments and bureaus do not smoke opium or other substitutes, handled serial guarantees in the 23rd year. Now that more than a year has passed, it is urgent to re-verify the guarantees once. If the original guarantor is unwilling to guarantee, strict investigation and handling should be carried out. Changes in personnel should also fill in the serial guarantee form for future reference. A special order was issued to all civil servants to comply. After this inspection, if any person in the mutual guarantee is found to be smoking opium or other substitutes, and the test is true, in addition to punishing the person in accordance with the law, the persons in the serial guarantee shall be subject to severe punishment.</p>

Since the 11th, the sky has been cloudy and rainy. It only cleared up on the evening of the 12th, which slightly affected the preparations. It was changed to depart on the 13th. The engineering team of more than forty people, led by team leader Li Wen, and led by the chief of the survey team, first went to Taixian, and then transferred to Donghai to conduct survey work in the coastal areas.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Social Education Institutions Likely to Be Retained</h3>
<p>The Provincial Department of Education previously issued an order to all counties in the province to suspend all social education institutions by March 15 of this year, and to use the accumulated funds for civic training. This county had also received a clear order. It is now learned that the above-mentioned social education institutions, in the provincial civil education halls or alternate civil education halls in the location of the commissioner's district, will not be abolished. Jiangdu is one of the commissioner's districts. Although the commissioner's office has not yet been established, the center of Jiangyi Gaoying belongs to Yangzhou. Therefore, the responsible personnel of various social education institutions believe that a commissioner is bound to be established in this county, and they have been working hard to fight for it. It is now heard that the Education Department has approved that the county's public sports field will not be abolished, but the monthly recurring expenses will be reduced from 225 yuan to 120 yuan. Therefore, other social education institutions, such as the Femiao Public Education Center, also intend to request to be changed to provincial civil education halls in accordance with the established commissioner's district method to avoid being abandoned.</p>
<h3>Department Appoints Guo Weiji as Court President</h3>
<p>Luo Zhizhu, president of the Jiangdu Local Court, died of illness. The Higher Court telegraphed Judge Shao to temporarily replace him.

He has served as the president of Jiangnan College, a criminal law expert at the National Judicial Conference, and a professor at various law and political universities. It is heard that he will arrive in Yangzhou on the 14th to take over the affairs, and has sent Guo Mutang, Zhang Baonan, and others to Yangzhou in advance to discuss the handover matters.</p>
<h3>Bidding for Kaiming Bridge Project Settled</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Construction Bureau previously announced bidding for the reconstruction of Kaiming Bridge on Dadongmen Street into a flat bridge. It is now learned that there are seven bidders, including contractor Jiang Dian Gao. After the bidding, the highest bid was more than 1,190 yuan, and the lowest bid was Zhang Yongxing, estimated at 829 yuan in national currency.

<h3>Provincial Examination of Sericulture Guidance</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuexian, director and instructor of the Laoba Central Guidance Station of the Jiangdu Sericulture Improvement Zone, and Zai Xiangwan, assistant instructor of the Wujiaqiao station, were successively summoned by the Provincial Sericulture Committee for examination. The committee now considers Zhang Yuexian's examination to be qualified, and has ordered Director Ma to distribute the commission order and issue it. Dai Xiangwan's results are also still qualified, but due to funding reasons, he is allowed to be recorded as the director and instructor for future use.</p>

<h3>Three Banks Plan to Collect Silver from the Public / Current Coins Should be Exchanged for Legal Tender at County Governments / Three Banks to Dispatch Personnel to County Governments for Exchange</h3>
<p>According to the New News Agency, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank, since the Ministry of Finance ordered the concentration of reserves and the unification of the currency system on November 4 of last year, and ordered the three banks to exchange legal tender, now because legal tender has not been readily circulating in various places, the deadline has been extended to May 3. The three banks have now drafted three measures and sent them to the Issuance Reserve Committee to forward to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that provincial governments instruct the counties to inform the district and town chiefs to inform the people to exchange legal tender at the county governments within the deadline. The original letter said: "Since the government ordered</p>
<p>Concentrated Reserves</p>
<p>Unified Issuance, our three banks, aware of the importance of our position, have always regarded the promotion of effective implementation as our duty. Those that have already been organized include entrusting the provincial banks of various provinces to act as agents for collection and exchange, and the three banks to deposit legal tender for collection and exchange without profit, and negotiating with the Post Office Administration to order the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to sign agency collection and exchange contracts with the three banks, and then ordering the post offices in various places to act as agents for collection and exchange, so that the post offices, with their numerous institutions, can make legal tender penetrate into the countryside and collect silver from the interior. The Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Facilitates the Public</p>
<p>The purpose is also taken care of. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has consulted with the provincial and municipal governments to act as agents for collection and exchange. If legal tender is needed, the three banks are asked to advance it, and the provincial and municipal branches have been instructed to comply. However, given the vastness of our country and the long and deep-rooted habit of the people using current silver coins, unless publicity is carried out to the fullest extent and deadlines are strictly enforced, I am afraid that it will not be possible to be thorough in practice. Moreover, it is also heard that those ignorant villagers who hold silver coins are often defrauded, obstructed, or confiscated by others, causing the general public to be wary of exchanging legal tender, and as a result, it will directly hinder the smooth flow of legal tender. Those who hide silver in deep cellars are not only within the scope of your committee's planning, but also the three banks are concerned about contributing their ideas to improve the implementation. Now,</p>
<p>Research Results</p>
<p>are listed as follows: 1. The Ministry of Finance consults with the provincial and municipal governments and instructs the county magistrates to inform the district and town chiefs in advance to inform the people that if there are silver coins, they should exchange them for legal tender at the county government within the deadline. 2. Issue a notice in advance so that the public knows. 3. Each county should dispatch personnel from the nearest three banks to carry legal tender and be stationed in the county government to handle the exchange matters. The government should be asked to assist and protect. The above plan is based on the county government taking the lead, which is relatively easy to concentrate. However, considering that the implementation of the new policy should be in the location of each township and county seat, near or several miles, far or dozens of miles. If</p>
<p>Holders of Silver</p>
<p>If everyone has to bring the coins to the county government to exchange for legal tender, it is inevitable that the people will spend time and money. In order to make it easier for the people to exchange, the county magistrates may instruct the district and town chiefs to order the Baojia to inquire and register from house to house, report to the district and town chiefs, and report to the county government to request legal tender for exchange within the deadline. After the exchange, the silver coins should be transported to the county government and returned to the bank. The government should still be asked to send police to protect them along the way. Although the procedures are more complicated, there are many conveniences for the people, so I have prepared a statement for selection. How to deal with it is still hoped to be judged accordingly. After receiving the letter, the committee has forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for review."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Plans to First / Borrow Two Million Yuan from the Central Bank / For the Need to Consolidate Finance and Carry Out Post-Disaster Construction / Liu Hangchen Negotiates with the Three Banks on the Mortgage of Public Bonds</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, in order to complete the work of suppressing bandits in Sichuan and to handle post-disaster construction, issued the 25th Year of the Republic of China Sichuan Post-Disaster Public Bonds for 15 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, and interest paid twice a year at the end of March and September each year. The term is 15 years, and the principal and interest should be repaid with a subsidy of 40,000 yuan per month issued by the central government from the Sichuan salt tax, and a subsidy of 40,000 yuan per month allocated by the central government from the Sichuan tobacco and alcohol tax. In addition, the Sichuan Provincial Government will allocate 50,000 yuan per month from the business tax as a fund. The Chongqing branch of the Central Bank and its entrusted banks are designated as the managing agencies for repayment of principal and interest. Liu Hangchen, the head of the Sichuan Finance Department, was in Shanghai to discuss the mortgage with the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank for the issuance of post-disaster public bonds. Although the banks agreed, it is necessary to wait for the public bonds to be passed by the Legislative Yuan and the regulations to be promulgated by the National Government before officially negotiating and signing the mortgage contract. In addition, for the urgent need to consolidate Sichuan's finance and handle post-disaster matters, it is planned to first borrow two million yuan from the Central Bank. Now Director Liu has gone to Beijing a few days ago to</p>
<p>Minister of Finance and President of the Central Bank Kong Xiangxi, negotiated to borrow two million yuan for emergency use, and it has been allowed."</p>

<h3>Sir Leith-Ross Optimistic / About China's Legal Tender / Talks with Asahi Shimbun Reporter</h3>
<p>According to the External News Agency, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the financial advisor who came to China in August last year, stayed in China for more than half a year, and after completing various investigations and reports in various parts of China, when he was about to return home, he met with a reporter from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun at the Cathay Hotel on the 5th afternoon to state his views on the development of China's financial circles after the currency reform. The content of his talk is as follows: The development of China's finances after the currency reform 日本 seems to have some misunderstandings, but I believe that the overall trend is very smooth. After the currency reform, exports increased and imports decreased, so the trade balance has been greatly improved. It is also worth noting that settlements outside of trade have also improved. That is, the money used by travelers in China and the money remitted from overseas has increased rapidly. The actual situation of the international balance of payments seems to have been significantly solidified after the currency reform. Then, is there no cause for concern about the maintenance of China's currency system? Of course, this is not without its problems. The United States de facto abandoned its silver price increase policy in December last year, causing the world silver market to plummet, and China's currency system, because the reserve for the currency is silver, ended up causing its value to fall. It is inevitable that it is not beneficial to sell silver overseas to create foreign currency funds. However, the decline in the silver market, on the one hand, makes it easier for China to nationalize silver. Recently, a large amount of silver has been recovered by the government's hand (probably 4 million yuan per week), and the low silver price has the good result of preventing secret exports. In order to make the new currency system continue for a long time in the future, is there any need for assistance from various countries? If Japan and the United Kingdom provide assistance after the currency reform, it will be of great help. If financial assistance is difficult, technical assistance is also good. When I came to China, I said that Japan should also send financial experts, which is due to this kind of view. At this time, any kind of assistance to China will have very good results. If China's financial circles are stable and trade increases, Japan, which is geographically closest, will receive the greatest benefits. Japan is very concerned about the expansion of Chinese banknotes in the future. How about this? There are many things that should be improved, such as huge military expenditures and other financial matters. However, if the government deals with it with a sincere attitude in the future, there is no risk of malignant inflation. Japan is most concerned about this point, but there is no other way but to hope that the Chinese government will exercise self-restraint. If possible, I would very much like to be the Minister of Finance of China (smiling). Also, the Ministry of Finance recently exchanged domestic bonds for long-term ones, reducing the payment of principal and interest on domestic debts by a quarter. Private bankers have suffered a lot from this, but the government's financial burden has been reduced. The currency reform is also like this. In the case of public bond borrowing, it can also be considered that the Chinese government authorities were too anxious, causing artificial inflation. I think that a strong contraction has made the industrial world have no way out. Therefore, in order to revive the purchasing power of the people, a slow expansion to a certain extent may also be necessary. If the supply of currency returns to the state three years ago and the savings of the people increase, it will be easier for the government to issue new public bonds, which will avoid rapid inflation. Currency reserves can be trusted by the new currency system. Chinese private bankers have been controlled, and it is impossible for the government to expand arbitrarily without consulting with them. In this sense, I hope that there will be a completely independent central bank. Some people seem to say that China will not succeed in using banknotes as currency. What do you think? I'm afraid not. In short, the circulation of banknotes was slightly difficult in North China at first, but after the collection of silver and the withdrawal of hard currency from circulation, there were no other means of exchange besides banknotes. Now banknotes are gradually circulating in large quantities. The circulation of banknotes in South China, Guangdong, and Guangxi probably does not need to be too concerned. The fact that the Peasant Bank issued banknotes other than the government to the bank has been criticized. This seems to be a measure to alleviate the congestion in the rural financial world. On the Hong Kong side, it is rumored that the Duke hopes to convene an international conference on Chinese economic assistance in Tokyo or London in September this year. I wonder if this is true? There seem to be such rumors, but it is not known to me at all. Frankly speaking, can the UK and Japan coordinate on Chinese economic assistance? This kind of coordination between the UK and Japan is the most desirable thing. It is the best way to help China. For this reason, when I went to Shanghai, I exchanged opinions with diplomats and financiers. It is rumored that I will return home via Japan soon. How about that? It has not yet been decided. This will depend on the orders of my government.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Chinese Antiquities in England to be Shipped Back Regularly; Escorted by British Warships Along the Way</h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th reports that the Chinese artworks exhibited in England will be loaded onto the British India Steam Navigation Company's ship "Lampoo Ra" on May 17th for return to China. A British warship will provide protection along the route in stages.</p>
<h3>Iranian Consulate General to Host Reception Today to Celebrate the Emperor's Birthday</h3>
<p>The newly established Iranian (Persian) government has recently upgraded its consulate in Shanghai to a consulate general, and has specially appointed Mr. Ostovan, who has been serving as a first-class consul in Shanghai for two years, as the first first-class consul general. Mr. Ostovan arrived in Shanghai in May 1934 to establish the consulate. Going forward, the Iranian Consulate General will be responsible for managing all matters pertaining to Iranian people throughout China. As Mr. Ostovan is the only representative in China, he will also handle all diplomatic and political affairs between the Iranian government and China. This upgrade by the Iranian government is clearly a further expression of goodwill toward China. Mr. Ostovan has always been a friend of China and deeply admires the diligence and peacefulness of the Chinese people. Today (the 15th) is the birthday of His Majesty Emperor Baharavi of Iran, and Mr. Ostovan has scheduled a reception for Chinese and foreign guests at the Consulate General in the morning. It is expected to be a grand occasion with a bustling crowd.</p>

This decision comes after the Japanese community in Shanghai requested an increase in Japanese directors from two to three seats. However, the election results are still uncertain. The names of the candidate directors are listed below: Arnold (British), Arnhold &amp; Co.; Cahan (American), Citibank; Franklin (American), Lawyer; Homin (Japanese), South Manchuria Railway; Keswick (British), Jardine Matheson; Macnaughton (British), British American Tobacco; Meekel (British), Butterfield &amp; Swire; Board (British), North China Daily News; Bokube Takujo (Japanese), Mitsui &amp; Co.; Yamamoto Takeo (Japanese), Nippon Yusen Kaisha. In addition, there is Sir Pears (British), who has been proposed by Spabag and seconded by Loo Ban Sang, to be a land commissioner for 1936.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Japanese community in Shanghai nominated three candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, directly challenging the current Council. Since 1927, out of the nine seats on the Council, the Japanese have held two, the British five, and the Americans two. However, in 1932, a Dane, with the help of the Japanese, seized one of the American seats. In the ten years before 1927, the Japanese held only one seat, and the British held six, sometimes more. This year, the British community pre-voted and nominated five candidates, and the American community followed suit and nominated two. If the Japanese had also only nominated two candidates, there would have been no need for an election. However, the Japanese community nominated three candidates at the last minute yesterday: Bokube, the Shanghai manager of Mitsui; Yamamoto, the Shanghai manager of Nippon Yusen Kaisha; and Homin, the Shanghai manager of the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, the election to be held on the 23rd and 24th of March will be highly competitive, and whether the current Council can maintain its position depends entirely on the outcome.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior and Central Propaganda Department Conferring on Reducing the Price of Party and National Flags; City Federation Has Received Reply from the Ministry of Interior</h3>

<h3>Large Shipment of Jiangxi Rice Arrives; Last Batch After Jiangxi Province Implemented Rice Ban</h3>
<p>Jiangxi has always been a rice-producing area, with a large amount of rice shipped to Shanghai every year. Recently, Jiangxi, considering the food supply for its own province, determined that the total rice and grain in Jiangxi was only sufficient to supply the province. Therefore, the provincial authorities, in order to save the food supply for the province, decided to implement a ban on rice exports. Those who had already purchased rice from rice merchants in various places were allowed to ship it out, but further exports from Jiangxi were prohibited. Due to the ban, rice merchants in Shanghai rushed to send ships to transport the Jiangxi rice they had purchased. The Ning Shao Company's "Ning Jing" ship arrived in Shanghai from Xun today, carrying 20,000 bags of Jiangxi rice. It is said to be the last batch before Jiangxi Province implemented the export ban.</p>
<h3>Clear Weather; Shanghai-Guangdong Flight Resumes</h3>
<p>A report from the Shen Shi News Agency states that the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong money plane had to turn back mid-flight the day before due to cloudy weather and heavy fog. Yesterday, the weather improved, and the flight took off for Guangdong.</p>
<h3>German Government Abrogates the Locarno Pact; German Residents Express Their Views; Regard it as an Act of Self-Defense</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that a certain German organization in Shanghai has released the opinions of German residents in both Beijing and Shanghai regarding their government's announcement of the abrogation of the Locarno Pact. The translation is as follows: "Germany's declaration of the abrogation of the Locarno Pact is aimed at maintaining peace among European countries. The Locarno Pact was originally an agreement among Western European powers to prevent mutual aggression, with the purpose of guaranteeing peace on Germany's western border. Since the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Pact, the German government has been placed in a position of being attacked, and the grand aspiration of maintaining permanent peace in Western Europe has been legally and politically completely destroyed by this Pact. Therefore, the German government's action should not be criticized by the world. The German government has been reiterating its legal viewpoint since May of last year. Therefore, the recent steps taken by the German government are purely the result of the facts created by the other party. After declaring the abrogation of the Pact, Germany immediately prepared to return to the League of Nations and proposed to conclude non-aggression pacts with neighboring countries. This is sufficient proof of Head of State Hitler's outstretched hand to France, seeking peace. The entry of a small number of troops into the Rhineland is purely an act of self-defense."</p>

<h3>Guangdong Sugar Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities; Insufficient Purchasing Power in Various Regions; Warehouses Almost Unable to Accommodate</h3>
<p>Since Guangdong Province established sugar factories, its production has been relatively large. Sales in Shanghai have a strong presence. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships most of the sugar from Shantou and Guangdong to Shanghai, and the price is also cheaper than imported goods. However, this year, due to insufficient purchasing power in various regions, the Guangdong sugar arriving in Shanghai has accumulated over 100,000 dan (a unit of weight) in the Jinliyuan Wharf warehouse alone. As the situation is not improving, there is no place to store the sugar that arrives later.</p>

<h3>City Federation Sends Letter to City Chamber of Commerce to Convene General Meeting of Various Industries to Discuss How to Deal with Telephone Reform</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation of Shanghai yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce based on the resolution of the 15th Executive Committee meeting, stating: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, The Shanghai Telephone Company, disregarding the current economic downturn and commercial depression, is recklessly pursuing a course that is unpopular with the public and difficult to achieve. Out of more than 40,000 users, in addition to those who have made the final decision to remove their telephones, the rest are temporarily submitting with reluctance and dissatisfaction while observing the situation. Considering that your Chamber leads the merchants, we request that you promptly convene a general meeting of representatives from various trade associations to discuss how to deal with this situation, so that justice can be upheld and the people can be relieved from distress. Otherwise, our frugality will not be enough to satisfy their exploitation, and we will be like fish on a cutting board. We believe that your Chamber has an inescapable duty and cannot decline this request."</p>

<h3>International Exposition Actively Preparing; Domestic Goods Manufacturers All Request to Participate in the Exhibition; Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, and Others Agree to Serve as Supporters</h3>
<p>People from all walks of life in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, are working to organize the Shanghai International Exposition to save the declining market. Various preparatory matters are being promoted separately, and it has been decided to officially open on July 1st. Domestic goods manufacturers, such as the Mayer Silk Mill, have successively sent letters to the Association requesting to participate in the exhibition. Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, and others have also agreed to serve as supporters of the Association. The preparation situation of the Association is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Manufacturers Participate</p>
<p>Domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai believe that there will be a large number of visitors at the opening of the Association, so they have decided to use this opportunity to promote domestic goods. They have repeatedly negotiated with the authorities of the Association to discuss implementation measures, and have obtained considerable results. The authorities of the Association have agreed to establish a domestic goods exhibition area in the venue for public viewing. It has also been learned that manufacturers in Shanghai, such as the Mayer Silk Mill, have been sending personnel to the preparation office of the Association in recent days to request to participate in the exhibition when the time comes. This happens several times a day. It is expected that it will be a grand occasion in the future.</p>
<p>Organizational Support</p>
<p>Various organizations, such as the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, have expressed their support for the establishment of the Association and believe that the Association will not only be sufficient to save the decline of the market, but also increase the enthusiasm of citizens to purchase domestic goods. Therefore, leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, have successively sent letters to the Association expressing their support. Industrial and commercial leaders Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, and others have all sent letters to the Association agreeing to serve as supporters of the Association.</p>
<p>Leasing Shop Spaces</p>
<p>The preparation office of the Association believes that the construction of the Congress venue can be fully completed by mid-June and officially opened on July 1st. A letter states that due to the decline of all industries and the economic hardship of the people in Shanghai in recent years, it is necessary to work hard to promote products in order to overcome the difficulties, especially to expand foreign trade. At the Chicago Exposition in the United States in the past, our country was limited by funds and only had a small number of items on display, but it had already gained the recognition of people from various countries. Export trade has been slightly boosted as a result. If there had been large-scale participation at that time, the results would not have been limited to this. Our Association has now scheduled to hold a meeting in Yangshupu, Shanghai in July and August this year to display Chinese and foreign goods and hold public exhibitions. The purpose is to be a pioneer in introducing and promoting various commodities, as well as a source of information for grinding and improving. At the same time, various high-end entertainments will be set up to help viewers' interest. It has already received attention and promotion from Chinese and Western newspapers, and millions of visitors are expected to visit at that time. It is known that your company produces high-quality products and is expected to be willing to use our Association to promote and increase sales as much as possible. The shop spaces for display set by our Association are about fourteen feet square and nine feet high, with one hundred branches. If you are willing to book with us, you are most welcome. Please indicate your interest so that we can send someone to contact you. I hereby inform you of this and attach a small book, hoping that you will read it carefully and wish you peace.</p>

Moreover, traditional Chinese medicine is related to the inherent culture and the people's livelihood and economy, and should always be valued. The associations have designated March 17th as 'March 17th National Traditional Medicine Day' last year, and it has been recognized by national medical and pharmaceutical organizations. After the promulgation of the Chinese Medicine Regulations this year, it is even more appropriate to be grateful for the source and not forget the original.

<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Regularly Implements Asphalt Inspection Starting on March 16th This Year</h3>
<p>Asphalt is one of China's major exports. Since the Ministry of Industry has successively implemented inspections of various oils, such as tung oil, tea oil, cottonseed oil, and peanut oil, it is also necessary to inspect asphalt. Therefore, the Ministry ordered the Shanghai and Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureaus to prepare separately and open at the same time. After receiving the order, the two bureaus immediately completed preparations and were approved to start inspection on March 16th this year. In addition to the Ministry of Industry consulting the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Customs to assist in handling, the two bureaus announced the implementation. From this month onwards, export applications must be submitted to the bureau for inspection and only those that pass the inspection may be declared for export. According to the regulations for the implementation of the inspection, the asphalt is divided into bark oil and wood oil. The standards for passing the inspection are: bark oil moisture (percentage) not higher than 3.00, impurities not higher than 0.60, fatty acid congealing point (Celsius) not lower than 51 degrees; wood moisture not higher than 5.00, impurities not higher than 0.60, fatty acid congealing point not lower than 41 degrees (adulteration is considered unqualified). It is reported that the Shanghai Bureau lists this inspection under the chemical industrial product inspection group. Merchants in this industry should report the inspection to this group.</p>

<h3>Xie Xiaochu and Other Executive Committee Members of the Ratepayers' Association Propose Convening a General Meeting to Discuss the Telephone Rate Change Issue</h3>
<p>*Xin Sheng News Agency*: Since the telephone rates in the concession area changed on the first of this month, all industries have been affected. Yesterday, Xie Xiaochu and other executive committee members of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession proposed convening a general meeting to jointly discuss practical solutions to awaken the telephone authorities. The original text of the proposal is recorded below: "Proposal: Regarding the Concession Telephone, since the implementation of the disguised price increase and the charging by call, after a ten-day trial, all industries have felt the difficulties deeply. It is said that at this time of economic downturn and sluggish markets, if landlords take into account the overall situation, they would automatically reduce rents. Now, the telephone, which relies on public utility, is increasing prices rapidly during this period. Not only are there restrictions on the number of calls, but also the standards are entirely based on the company's calculations. There is no way for subscribers to verify, not only is it difficult for users to afford, but also deep suspicion arises. Although this association has repeatedly strived to increase the basic number of calls and install computers for calculating, the company has failed to consider the public interest and has not shown any sincerity, and has resolutely implemented the rate increase. Therefore, citizens have complained, saying that the telephone authorities do not appreciate the difficulties of the times, or that this association has not been effective in negotiations, and criticisms have been pouring in. This association, as a representative of the citizens, has failed to live up to the expectations of the public and feels regretful. As it concerns a public utility, this association should immediately convene a general meeting of representatives to discuss coping strategies and engage in practical negotiations to comfort the hopes of the citizens. This is what we can do. We respectfully request a public decision." Proposer: Xie Xiaochu. Seconders: Zheng Chengqing, Fang Jiaobo, Xie Zhongjun, Jin Runxiang, Nuo Wenqi, Ye Jiaxing.</p>
<h3>Thief Stealing Bicycles Caught Inside the Jianghai Customs</h3>
<p>At the bicycle parking area behind the Jianghai Customs at 10:30 AM yesterday, an apprentice from the Yicheng Customs Brokerage was riding a bicycle to the customs for business. After locking the bike, he hurriedly entered the merchants' waiting room and handed the import bill of lading to Mr. Feng, a customs broker from the firm. The broker immediately instructed the apprentice to return to the firm. Due to the warm weather, the door to the waiting room was open, and upon exiting, he saw someone using tools to pry open the bike lock and about to leave. The apprentice immediately shouted, and the thief, realizing the situation was bad, abandoned the bike and ran. A customs guard stopped and questioned him, but his answers were evasive. He was sent to the customs shipmaster's office for questioning and then transferred to the Water Police Station for further investigation.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Strictly Prohibits Smoking, Dismantles Over a Hundred Opium Dens, and Begins Exchanging Civilian Licenses on the First of Next Month; Citizens Who Quit Voluntarily Will Be Subject to Random Inspections by the Bureau</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau's registration of smokers concluded at the end of last December, over 32,000 smokers have been registered. The first batch of registration licenses has expired. It is now scheduled to begin exchanging licenses on April 1st. The bureau has also been dispatching personnel to investigate and dismantle over a hundred opium dens, all of which have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling in accordance with the anti-smoking regulations. A reporter from Dagong News Agency met with Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the smoker registration section of the bureau, yesterday, who provided the following detailed information:</p>
<p>License Exchange Begins on the First of Next Month. Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau's smoker registration section implemented mandatory smoker registration on July 1st of last year, the results have been very significant. By the end of the year, a total of over 32,000 smokers had been registered. The section has separately compiled registers and reported them to the Anti-Smoking Supervision Department for record-keeping. As the first batch of six-month licenses has expired, the Municipal Government has approved the commencement of exchange on April 1st, which is limited to May 31st. Those who fail to exchange their licenses within the deadline will still be prosecuted for unlicensed private smoking. The license exchange fee remains the same as before: 5 yuan for general licenses and 6 jiao for poverty licenses. The bureau has drafted five points of information for the exchange of smoking licenses, which have been printed and will be posted simultaneously with the announcement to inform smokers in all districts to pay attention and comply. The exchange address will still be handled by the police stations in the respective districts.</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Opium Dens Dismantled</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate the scourge of opium, the bureau attaches great importance to privately established opium dens within its jurisdiction. Therefore, the bureau has appointed special investigators to cooperate with the police stations to conduct strict investigations. According to Dai Lizhen, the chief of the smoker registration section, over a hundred opium dens have been dismantled in recent days, and over two hundred opium offenders have been arrested, all of whom have been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for handling under military law. As for those who smoke without a license, the number is also large, mostly coolies. After interrogation by the Garrison Headquarters, they are sent to designated drug rehabilitation hospitals for compulsory rehabilitation. Once they are weaned off the drug, they will be sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<p>Voluntarily Quitting Smokers Subject to Random Inspections</p>
<p>Since the strict anti-smoking measures were implemented in this city, many smokers have deeply regretted and voluntarily quit smoking, reaching over two thousand people, all of whom have been reported to the Public Security Bureau for record-keeping. The bureau fears that smokers' will may not be firm and that they may relapse. Therefore, they are rotated and randomly inspected by the bureau at any time. Last month, six smokers who had already quit smoking were found to be relapsing. After certification by the drug rehabilitation hospital, they were transferred to the Garrison Headquarters and sentenced to three months of imprisonment. If they are found to be relapsing after being released from prison, they will be sentenced to more than one year of imprisonment. If they relapse a third time, they will be shot to serve as a warning.</p>

<h3>Extortion Letter Delivered in Person, Gang Not Small</h3>
<p>Hat Removed as Signal, Chinese and Western Detectives Rush Forward</p>
<p>Zhou Erda Arrested, Confesses to Extortion</p>
<p>Wu Xielun, from Jiangyin, who works in political circles, and his uncle Wu Yefu, are teachers at the Yucai Public School on Shanhai Road. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, Wu Yefu was walking out of the school, preparing to return to his residence at No. 35 Meicun, Gissfield Road, when suddenly a person, on Cade Road, stuffed a letter under Wu's arm and ran away. Upon inspecting the letter, it was addressed to Wu Yefu and Wu Xielun, containing intense language, intending to extort 5,000 yuan in foreign currency, limited to the 4th, to send the money to the entrance of the Civilian Maternity Hospital on Maigen Road, where someone would come to negotiate. Otherwise, the two uncles and nephews would be kidnapped. Wu then wrote a reply letter, placed one yuan in legal tender inside, and left it at the entrance of the hospital. Soon after, a person took the letter away. Afterwards, Wu received two more extortion letters, stating that the reply letter had been received, but that negotiations must continue. The location was changed to the entrance of the Xihai Tai Theater at Chihang Road, Xinzha Road. The person would stand there for five minutes, then turn east towards Xinzha Road. However, the amount of money demanded was changed to 4,500 yuan. Wu then took the letter to report to the Xinzha police station, which dispatched Chinese detective Wu Changkai and Western detective Kainaitai to wait at the location. Wu Yefu was instructed to remove his hat as a signal. Wu then held a paper package, pretending to be 200 yuan in banknotes, mixed with two yuan in legal tender. At eight o'clock the morning before yesterday, he stood at the entrance of the Xihai Tai Theater for five minutes, then walked towards Xinzha Road. At that time, Zhou Erda, from Wuxi, came forward to talk to Wu. Wu immediately said that due to the current market situation, he was in financial straits and could not raise a large sum of money, so he only brought 200 yuan. The bandit Zhou then instructed Wu to walk forward to a quiet place to hand over the money. At this point, Wu removed his hat, and the Chinese and Western detectives rushed forward and arrested Zhou, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, stating that there were accomplices at large in this case and requesting an extension of the detention period. Furthermore, Wu Qiawen submitted a statement proving the details of the conversation and negotiation with the defendant yesterday morning. Upon questioning the defendant, he confessed that he, Song Shengda, and Liu Linsheng had conspired at the Jintai Hotel on Simalu beforehand, which was confirmed by Liu Yugui, the judge, who ordered Zhou Erda to be returned to custody for another seven days of questioning.</p>

He checked into room 22 alone the night before last. It was not discovered by the tea boy until 9:00 AM yesterday. The police were notified, and patrolman number 150 went to investigate.

<h3>Fujian Merchants in Shanghai Plan to Establish an Xingan Cane Sugar Business Office</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Today. The lower reaches of Fujian Province were once very rich in cane sugar production. In the late Qing Dynasty, driven by profit, farmers switched to planting opium, so cane sugar disappeared in Shanghai. Fifty years ago, Shanghai's sugar industry mostly belonged to the Fujianese. Looking at the signboards of the Southern Goods Stores, there are still words such as "Min-Guang foreign sugar," which is clear evidence. In recent years, the opium ban has been very strict, and the promotion of rural construction has been particularly strong. Therefore, farmers in the Xingquan Zhang and other areas in the lower reaches of Fujian have all restored cane sugar cultivation and sugar making. Although the profit is lower than planting opium, it is better than planting rice, wheat, and sweet potatoes. Therefore, Shanghai has a new source of Fujian sugar. More than a dozen Shanghai-based Fujian sugar businesses, including Zhicheng, Tianxiang, Zhaotai, Jiancheng, Wanchun, Fuyu, Lichun, Jiechun, Fangcai, Taiyuan, and Jichun, have been planning to organize a cane sugar business office at the Xingan Guild Hall for days. One party unites forces, one party asks the government to reduce taxes to show encouragement, and one party finds ways to improve cane sugar. A formal preparatory meeting was held at 4:00 PM on March 11th, which decided to establish the Shanghai Xingan Cane Sugar Business Office, draft articles of association and rules, invite colleagues to participate, and hire Wang Pingnan, a lawyer, as a legal advisor. The articles of association and rules were also scheduled to be held at noon on March 15th to hold the establishment meeting.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Industry Forms Northwest Inspection Group</h3>

After Lu Xingzhuang, the chairman, delivered a farewell speech, Zhang Zilian stood up to thank them, saying that the handicrafts made by the disaster-stricken children's education institute in Shaanxi would be used to subsidize expenses. There is a lot of open space there. General Zhu Ziqiao and Chairman Shao Lizi have repeatedly invited them to go for inspection, so they are scheduled to leave on the 15th of this month. The inspection results will be reported in detail to the domestic goods industry for reference.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Rice and Grain in Ningbo, Ministry of Industry Orders Agricultural Bank to Provide Relief</h3>
<p>*Zhong Shi News Agency*: Due to the poor autumn harvest last year in Ningbo, Zhejiang, the rice store reserves have been exhausted. Now, during the transition period, and the money supply is very tight, so they are unable to purchase rice and grain. Chairman Wang Wenhan and Zhao Zhishi of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce were specifically sent to Shanghai to discuss relief measures with fellow villagers in Shanghai, and a meeting was held at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. As a result, Yu Zuoyan and Zhang Shenzhi were sent to Beijing on the 9th of this month, accompanied by local representatives Wang and Zhao, to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry to request relief measures. The four representatives returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that the results of this trip were very satisfactory. The Ministry of Industry has ordered the China Farmers Bank to organize a banking syndicate to purchase rice and grain from various places to overcome this difficulty. After the autumn harvest, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce will be responsible for repaying the funds.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Water Supply Cut Off by Water Company</h3>
<p>Ratepayers' Association Sends Letter to Public Works Department Requesting Correction</p>
<p>*Guo Wen News Agency*: The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Director General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession yesterday, saying, "We are writing to inform you that we have received a letter from Hui Jiuxi Houji Chinese Pharmacy on Shanhai Road, stating that the price of tap water for their business was previously forwarded to the Public Works Department by the Chamber of Commerce for correction, but no reply has been received yet, which is very concerning. Subsequently, the water company continued to send bills that were inconsistent with the facts. Just as they were about to request a correction again, the company suddenly cut off the water supply on the 10th of this month, which is a hardship. However, if an unexpected event occurs, and an unfortunate incident results from the lack of water, the water company should bear the corresponding responsibility. Our business will not bear the nominal water fee. We are writing to request that your office forward this to the water company and urge them to exercise caution."</p>

<h3>Hongxin Steamer Collides with Multiple Boats</h3>
<p>Wang Genlang Falls into River and Dies</p>
<p>The Hongxin steamboat of the Postal Bureau, at 8 PM the night before, departed from the Customs Wharf on Hankou Road, carrying 365 pieces of mail, headed for the Osaka Company Wharf of the Japanese in Laobaidu, Pudong, intending to unload onto the Japanese vessel Yueyang Maru for shipment to other ports.  Around 8:25 PM, as it approached the outer side of the Yueyang Maru, two empty lighters (commonly known as "wharf boats"), No. 7082 and No. 6641, owned by boat owner Yu Chunhua, having just unloaded cargo from alongside the Yueyang Maru south of the Japanese ship Songshan Maru, turned around to exit and headed north.  The Hongxin, unable to stop and avoid them in time, violently collided with lighter No. 7082 on its starboard side. The lighter, unable to withstand the impact, immediately tilted to the right and capsized.  Of the four people on board, including the boat leader and crew, boat leader Jiang Wenxian was the first to climb onto the Hongxin, avoiding falling into the water.  Crew members Gu Jiaxiang, Lu Linkang, and Wang Genlang all fell into the water at the same time. Gu Jiaxiang was immediately rescued by a steamer from the Customs Water Police Station, which arrived after hearing the alarm. Lu Linkang was rescued by a rowboat, but his right leg was crushed. Wang Genlang, whose name was mentioned, could not be rescued in the darkness and tragically drowned, disappearing without a trace. At that time, the Hongxin pushed the capsized boat forward, causing the bottom of the capsized boat to collide with the starboard side of lighter No. 6641, causing that lighter to also capsize. The three people on board, including the boat leader and crew, were also rescued by the Water Police Station steamer.  The Hongxin, after causing the accident, was temporarily unable to stop moving forward, and at the same time collided with and capsized lighter No. 25385, which was drifting from the south. That boat was carrying a load of rice straw purchased by the Tianzhang Paper Mill, which was all lost. The two boatmen were rescued at the same time.  Officer No. 26 of the Water Police Station brought boat leader Jiang Wenxian of No. 7082, boat leader Wang Miaojin of No. 6641, boat owner Pan Asan of No. 25385, and the injured boatman Lu Linkang to the police station.  Lu was first sent to the hospital for treatment. Around 9 PM, the Hongxin steamboat completely unloaded the mail onto the Yueyang Maru and then also sailed to the Water Police Station, where the captain, Ji A’gen, surrendered himself to await questioning.  According to boat leaders Jiang Wenxian and Wang Miaojin, each had loaded eighty or ninety pieces of foreign cloth after unloading from the Songshan Maru, preparing to return to Suzhou Creek, but unexpectedly were overturned. The extent of the losses has not yet been determined.  Boat owner Pan Asan described the circumstances of the collision. Captain Ji A’gen of the Hongxin defended himself, claiming that as he approached the Yueyang Maru, he glimpsed a lighter drifting in front of him in the darkness. He urgently rang the bell for slow speed and then reverse, but the driver in the engine room did not notice until after the accident. He urgently ran to the engine room and shouted, then he started to reverse, but it was too late. The police chief, considering the case to be clear, ordered both parties to report to their respective boat owners and the postal bureau to resolve the matter according to the law.  As for the deceased boatman, Wang Genlang, all Chinese police were notified to be on the lookout for the body. It is reported that the deceased was 21 years old, from Hengsha, Pudong, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, black straight tribute silk shoes, and blue socks.</p>
<h3>City Federation Submits Petition to City Government to Restrict Dance Halls:  Proposing Four Evils; Starting with Two Restrictions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation yesterday submitted a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating: "Petition to Prohibit Dance Hall Operations to Uphold Morality and Maintain Social Order.  With foreign aggression intensifying and national crisis severe, the effort to resist invasion and save the nation depends on collective wisdom and effort, and striving for progress. However, the operation of dance halls in Shanghai has undergone abnormal development. Every night, they attract young men and women, engaging in wild singing and dancing throughout the night, indulging in dissolute and licentious behavior to the extreme. This is clearly contrary to the essence of the New Life Movement.  Furthermore, the Ministry of Education has explicit instructions prohibiting young people from entering dance halls. Other cities, such as the capital (Nanjing) and Peiping (Beijing), have also banned them. There has never been such a corrupt and chaotic phenomenon as in Shanghai. This, from the perspective of violating laws and regulations, is one reason to request prohibition. According to proper dancing is originally a kind of fitness exercise, but Shanghai dance halls achieve the opposite. Dance hall owners use the allure of female dancers and their appearance to achieve their goals of self-interest and profit. Young people, unaware, become trapped, suffering harm to their bodies and minds, which is truly unbearable to speak of. It is believed that strengthening the nation requires first strengthening the people. Young people are the backbone of society. Continuing to harm them in this way means that even if others do not destroy us, we will have no way to survive on our own. This, from the perspective of national survival, is the second reason to request prohibition.  Lately, social morality has deteriorated day by day, and urban dance halls are the stepping stones to this kind of evil. They are nominally meant to relieve fatigue through entertainment, but in reality, they lead to licentiousness through embracing. This is obvious to everyone, so how can it be denied? This, from the perspective of social morality, is the third reason to request prohibition.  At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and the social economy is extremely depressed, only by advocating thrift can we hope to achieve self-reliance. However, in dance halls, there are extravagant displays of lights and wine, and limitless spending. Once the money is exhausted, the weak and timid regret and commit suicide, while the cunning and shameless take risks. Today, cases of suicide and theft are constantly emerging. Examining the reasons, it is due to their usual indulgent, extravagant, and licentious lifestyle. This is the fourth reason to request prohibition, from the perspective of social order.  In summary, these four points have revealed the evils of dance hall operations. On a small scale, they damage customs and morals and endanger social order. On a larger scale, they can even destroy the lifeline of the nation, leading to the tragedy of national destruction and racial extinction. The Association, feeling the crisis, submitted a document to your government on the ninth day of November last year, requesting prohibition. Even if it is temporarily difficult to implement strict measures due to practical difficulties, in the view of this Association, the following two restrictions should be implemented first: authorities should stop issuing licenses to dance halls in the future; the operating hours of dance halls should not exceed 12 PM (2 AM on Saturdays at the latest) to achieve the goal of gradual prohibition.  This concerns social peace and the future of the entire nation and people. We earnestly request that you promptly prohibit or, at least, restrict these activities to rectify declining customs and reverse the deteriorating trend. We cannot express our eagerness enough. Respectfully submitted to the Mayor of Shanghai, Wu."</p>
<h3>Today's Memorial Service for Mr. Wang Guangqi Time: 10:00 AM Location: City Center District</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Guangqi was the grandson of Wang Zeshan, a famous poet from Sichuan. He was exceptionally talented, eager to learn, and went to Germany to study in 1920. He has been studying there for nearly sixteen years. Initially, he studied political economy, and for the past ten years, he has specialized in music. In 1934, he obtained a doctoral degree from the University of Bonn, Germany. His translations and writings are numerous and extensive. More than forty of his works have been published in China. Most recently, his edited and translated "National Defense Series" has been highly regarded by current commentators. In his early years, he also served as a special correspondent for major newspapers. The number of articles he published is even more difficult to count. His contribution to the academic and intellectual circles of our country is immense and significant. Currently, he was employed as a lecturer at the University of Bonn, and his return date was long delayed. Unfortunately, he passed away from cerebral hemorrhage on January 12 of this year in Bonn, Germany, at the young age of only 45. Mr. Wang lost his parents early, and he has no siblings or wife. He died far from home. However, his friends in Shanghai have scheduled a memorial service for today (the 15th) at 10:30 AM at the National Conservatory of Music in the city center to express their condolences. At that time, there will be a somber procession with plain carriages and white horses.</p>

<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Federation; Pharmacy Training School Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Pharmacy Training School affiliated with the National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations aims to train compounder personnel to meet the needs of the medical and pharmaceutical fields.

<h3>Huahua Silk and Satin Company Hosts Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 4 PM, Huahua Silk and Satin Company hosted the press at the company's second-floor shopping center on Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road. More than sixty people attended, including Yu Kongwo, Yan Esheng, and Lu Yi from the Xinwen Bao; Huang Tianpeng from the Shishi Xinbao; Chen Dafan and Gu Zhi'an from the Shibao; Jiang Hongjiao from the Minbao; Zhu Zhutong from the Damei Wanbao; and Mao Zipei from the Tiebao. The company's owner, Wang Yansong, and manager, Hu Meitang, provided attentive hospitality. They first led a tour of the entire second-floor shopping center and then visited various departments. The company was holding a spring sale, and the store was quite crowded with customers. The layout, decoration, lighting, and windows were all unique. The spaciousness, comfort, and cleanliness were its characteristics, especially the newly expanded second floor. There was also a fitting room for female customers, which was exquisitely designed and very thoughtful. After the tour, refreshments were served. During the event, Mr. Wang Yansong delivered a speech, stating: "The business community in our country has traditionally been conservative and unwilling to accept new ideas from the outside world, so progress has been slow. In this era of intense commercial warfare, a slight negligence can lead to failure. In recent years, although there has been more progress than before, everyone is engaged in competition. Competition can drive progress, and progress is necessary for survival. This is a good phenomenon, but the goals and methods of competition are often not carefully considered, so the results of competition are often 'failure' rather than 'success'. China is a semi-colonial country, and is under pressure from the dumping of foreign goods. The domestic business community is in a precarious situation, so the goal of competition should be external, not internal. While lower prices make goods easier to sell, the most important thing is still high quality. But many merchants are unaware of this and often mix inferior goods with quality goods, which will not lead to success. Therefore, the method of competition should first focus on the excellence of quality. Although Huahua Silk and Satin Company has limited resources, we are willing to proceed according to this principle. Since its opening, we have always adhered to the principle of 'seeking affordable prices through high-quality goods', earning the praise of thousands of customers, and we are unwilling to engage in competition that disregards commercial ethics, which would lead to unnecessary infighting among our peers. We believe that commercial ethics are the only key to commercial survival, so Huahua Company has been loudly advocating for prioritizing commercial ethics, and with the support of all parties and the promotion of the press, it has become a new movement in the business community, which is a great blessing for the future of business." After the speech, the company presented guests with silk-quality tablecloths specially printed by the company to enhance the atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Consolidated Tax Bureau Searches for Smuggled Shredded Tobacco</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the shortfall in cigarette tax revenue, the Jiang, Zhejiang, and Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau believes that the reason is the widespread establishment of retail shredded tobacco shops in the concessions. Many greedy people buy in small quantities and roll their own cigarettes. There are also stalls selling shredded tobacco in small teahouses and "tiger stoves" (public cooking stoves). Therefore, the bureau has sent a large number of inspectors to strictly inspect the borders of the Chinese-concession areas and has requested the assistance of the Public Security Bureau. There have been many cases discovered recently, all of which have been submitted to the bureau for punishment. Yesterday, Qiu Shuliang from Renbo was caught at Xiaobeimen for smuggling three yuan worth of shredded tobacco and resisting inspection. He was brought to the Lao Beimen police station for questioning and then handed over to officials to be taken to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Sentenced to Imprisonment; Wang Peiyuan Requests Retrial</h3>
<p>Wang Peiyuan, a lawyer from Dinghai, Zhejiang, joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member in 1933. He was practicing as a lawyer and was also a member of the Shanghai Lawyers Association's executive committee. In the morning, he was handling a case in Suzhou involving a lawsuit between Liu Yue'e, a young woman from Suzhou, and her mother, Liu Yin. Due to improper handling of the case, Liu Yue'e and her mother, Liu Yin, filed a private prosecution against Wang Peiyuan and Wang's younger sister, Lixia, in the Wu County District Court of Suzhou, accusing them of instigation. At the conclusion of the first trial, Wang Peiyuan was sentenced to one year in prison, and Wang Lixia was sentenced to five months in prison. Wang did not accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. After repeated summonses of the plaintiff and witnesses for interrogation, the trial concluded. The original verdict was changed due to the use of incorrect legal provisions. The "judgment text" regarding Wang Peiyuan and Wang Lixia was revoked. Wang Peiyuan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for joint theft, and Wang Lixia was sentenced to five months of imprisonment for joint theft. According to the provisions of Article 61 of the Litigation Law, cases involving the crimes listed therein cannot be appealed to the third-instance court after a second-instance judgment. However, Wang's younger sister has already served her sentence and has been released. Wang still has several months of his sentence remaining and is currently serving his sentence in prison in Suzhou. However, Wang still does not accept the verdict and has requested a retrial. It is unknown whether the retrial will be approved.</p>
<h3>Suffering from Prolonged Lung Disease; Ke Yuanding Commits Suicide in Hospital</h3>
<p>Ke Yuanding, 26 years old, from Huangyan, Zhejiang, was originally a businessman in his hometown. Three years ago, he contracted lung disease. Although he sought out many good doctors for diagnosis and treatment, he has not been cured to this day. Recently, his condition worsened, so his mother, Ke Pan, accompanied him to Shanghai on the 3rd of last month to seek treatment at the Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium Hospital on Da Xi Road. He was admitted to ward 207 of the hospital. Unexpectedly, around 2 PM the day before yesterday, Ke suddenly felt that his suffering could not be cured soon and suddenly had the thought of ending his life. Taking advantage of the nurses' lack of vigilance, he used the small foreign knife and scissors he had brought with him to cut his throat. When the female nurse, Dai Wanchun, was about to give him an injection, she discovered that his neck was covered in blood and his throat had been cut. She urgently reported to the hospital's doctors, who called in a surgeon to apply medicine and stitch up the wound. He was then sent to Renji Hospital, but the rescue efforts were ineffective, and he soon died. The Jing'an Temple Police Station ordered detectives Shi Huanting and others to rush to the scene for investigation. They took the body to the morgue on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Tang to arrive at the morgue to confirm the body's identity. It was determined that the deceased was Ke Yuanding, male, who had committed suicide by cutting his throat with a knife and scissors. The body was released to his mother, Ke Pan, who signed a statement and took it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Abductor Yao Baoshan Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</h3>
<p>Yao Baoshan (age 23) from Zhenjiang, recently became unemployed and wandered into Shanghai, finding it difficult to make a living. He joined a gang of abductors. At 5:50 PM on the 4th of this month, Zu Yuan, the five-year-old child of Yong native Yang Xiaochang, who lived at No. 27, Lane 76, Yuezhou Road, was playing in a nearby open space, watching a street performance. Another child bumped into him, causing him to cry. Yao took the opportunity to pick him up, intending to abduct him to Ximen and hand him over to his accomplice, Shen Xizhi, to sell for profit. At that moment, the child's father, Xiaochang, saw him and questioned him. Yao falsely claimed that he was taking the child to his mother, but his words were hesitant. He was immediately seized, and Chinese Officer No. 3073 and Detective Gu Wenyu arrived and took him to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and sent to the First Special District Court. The accused was held in custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiephan continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Public Works Department stated that the investigation during the adjournment revealed that the defendant, from September of last year to February of this year, colluded with the escaped Shen Xizhi and Lao Qi, as well as a woman named Ma Gugu, to abduct and sell three children, all around four years old, at places such as Yalu Road in Hongkou, Xiaoximen in the South City, and Bai'er Road in the French Concession. Each child was sold for only ten yuan, with the defendant receiving four or two yuan. However, the victims could not be found for questioning. It was learned that Shen Xizhi lived at No. 74 Xinqiao Street in the South City, and Ma Gugu lived at No. 105 An'najin Road in the French Concession, but both could not be arrested. He requested that the defendant be punished according to the law. When questioned, the defendant confessed and begged for leniency.

<h3>Wei Sansheng Issued a Check Because of Dancing and Romance</h3>
<p>Only One Yuan, Two Jiao, and Three Fen Remaining</p>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 17th</p>
<p>Wei Sansheng, the third son of Wei Tingrong, who resides at No. 99 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession, is 23 years old and once studied in France. Since returning to China, he has been unemployed at home. Recently, Wang Xinhe, the owner of the Saint Anna Dance Hall, had a lawyer file a criminal lawsuit in the Second Special Court against Wei Sansheng for issuing a bad check, stating that the defendant had been dancing at the Saint Anna Dance Hall every day before February of last year. Later, he became romantically involved with the dance star Liu Meimei. Because the family's finances were controlled by his father, he could not spend freely. Therefore, Wei Sansheng discussed with the plaintiff to borrow 500 yuan for Liu Meimei to use as pocket money. Later, Wei Sansheng signed a check for 500 yuan from the Commercial Savings Bank. Subsequently, Wei Sansheng came to dance and did not pay in cash, but simply signed his name on the dance tickets each night. Unexpectedly, the check issued by Wei was returned due to insufficient funds. Despite repeated negotiations, he ignored them. The dance ticket fees owed, totaling more than one hundred yuan, were filed as another lawsuit. After the court granted permission, the judge summoned both parties once, but neither arrived. Yesterday, they were summoned again. Judge Qiu presided over the trial in the Second Court. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The court investigated the bank and found that Wei Sansheng had only one yuan, two jiao, and three fen remaining in his account, so it was considered that he had issued a bad check. The court ordered both parties to conclude their arguments and scheduled sentencing for the 17th.</p>
<h3>Zhou Keda Sues Jin Yangji for Land Encroachment</h3>

In 1929, the defendant occupied it and built a house for his own use. Repeated negotiations failed. Therefore, the plaintiff obtained a land ownership certificate from the relevant authorities and then attempted to reason with the defendant, but the defendant continued to resist. He was forced to file a lawsuit. After the court accepted the case, Judge Zai Run repeatedly interrogated the parties. Due to the complexity of the case, he ordered that an on-site inspection was necessary to reach a verdict. Yesterday, the judge summoned both the plaintiff and the defendant to court. After a brief interrogation, the judge, to be cautious and thorough, accompanied both the plaintiff and the defendant to the site north of Xieqiao in the South City for a long period of on-site inspection. He ordered both parties to leave and await the trial.</p>

<h3>Ink Industry Association Expresses Difficulties of the Trade</h3>
<p>Recently, ink-making workers from Wuyuan, due to demands for improved treatment from employers, went on strike for ten days. The matter remains unresolved. Yesterday, according to those in charge of the trade association, the Wuyuan ink industry mainly sells to Southeast Asia, Korea, the Northeast Four Provinces, and Shandong and Hebei. In 1927, there were more than 600 workers in the industry. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn and heavy taxes outside the port, it has been difficult to compete with local ink, and sales have sharply decreased. It was necessary to reduce the number of workers and save expenses. Therefore, to date, the total number of workers in the industry is only one-tenth of what it used to be. Workers have always been paid on a piecework basis. This spring, employers, due to poor business, had no intention of starting work. At that time, some workers, fearing that they would have difficulty making a living after losing their jobs, voluntarily suggested that they sign a contract with employers, reducing wages to reflect labor-management mutual assistance. However, shortly after work began, a strike was suddenly announced. The association deeply regrets this and has reported the situation to the party and government agencies and is waiting for a resolution.</p>

<p>Last night was the second act of international basketball. The first match was the Group B final between Russia and the Philippines, with Russia emerging victorious with a score of 32 to 20, thereby winning this year's Group B championship and receiving a silver cup. This was followed by the second match between China and the United States. After taking to the court, China consistently took the lead, ending the first half with a score of 18 to 16. The situation remained unchanged at the start of the second half. It was only in the last ten minutes that the United States surpassed them, with the final result being 45 to 40. China was defeated by a difference of five points. Currently, China and the United States have each won one game, making for an even contest. A third final match is scheduled for next Wednesday to compete for the championship. The details of yesterday's match are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Chinese Team Takes the Court: A Force to Be Reckoned With</p>
<p>At 8:10 PM, the two teams lined up. China fielded Feng, Xu, Qiu, Wang, and Sun. The American team responded with Johnson, Bryce, Line, Carson, and Murphy. At the sound of the whistle, the Chinese team advanced rapidly, quickly reaching the basket. Xu Wenkui and Feng Nianhua successively attempted shots, but both missed. After some maneuvering, Wenkui's bravery remained undiminished, scoring two consecutive baskets, giving China a four-point lead. Suddenly, Nan Zhen was injured and left the court, replaced by Cai Yanxiong. The skills of this renowned general were indeed extraordinary. With a swing of his iron arm, he immediately achieved remarkable results. The scoreboard showed China leading by six points, while the United States still had zero. China's momentum was at its peak, their attack a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>China Wins the First Half by Two Points</p>
<p>American player Carson attempted several shots, but all were unsuccessful. After a long time, he finally scored two points. The American team then changed its strategy, switching to individual marking, making it difficult for the Chinese team to advance. Cai Yanxiong scored one point from a free throw. Line scored three points from free throws, followed by Bryce with another score, making it seven to seven. The opposing team's momentum surged.</p>
<p>After a timeout for the Chinese team, Sun Baoqing scored one point from a free throw, and Cai Yanxiong made a successful shot. Line lurked beneath the basket, missing a shot. Xu Wenkui scored two points from free throws. Bryce and Line quickly caught up, making it twelve to twelve, once again creating a tie. Wenkui scored repeatedly, while Line stealthily made a sneak attack, ending the first half at 18 to 16, with China winning by two points.</p>
<p>A Half-Point Difference, Tense Atmosphere</p>
<p>Switching sides for the second half, the American team replaced Murphy with Bennett. After some maneuvering, Qing committed a foul, resulting in a one-point penalty. Cai Yanxiong displayed his skills under the basket. Line retaliated. China requested a substitution, and players dashed across the court, unpredictable in their movements. Feng Nianhua made a successful jump shot. Guangbian slipped in a basket, making it 24 to 19, with China taking a significant lead. The atmosphere became tense to the extreme. Line defended stubbornly, with a tight defense, making it impossible to advance. Before long, Carson scored a basket, and China requested a timeout to discuss their strategy. Sure enough, Guangbian's shots came easily, but Bennett and Carson closely guarded him, scoring successively, causing a rapid reversal. The American team closed the gap to 26 to 25, a difference of only one point.</p>
<p>Reversal to Defeat: China Suffers a Setback</p>
<p>The American team pressed forward relentlessly. Wenkui broke through the encirclement and scored a basket. Carson and Nianhua each scored one point. Bennett continued with a successful basket, and the two sides were still only one point apart. Da Yun, Xu Hengzong, and Qi replaced Wenkui, Wenxie, and Yanxiong. Bryce made two out of two free throws, making it 30 to 29, with the American team taking the lead by one point. Nianhua scored a basket. Johnson was unwilling to be outdone and retaliated with a score. Da Yun displayed his skills, tying the score at 33 all.

Carson and Johnson successively scored, making it 43 to 38, putting China in a difficult position. Carson and Yanxiong fouled out. Wenkui pulled back six points. Johnson also scored a basket. Before long, the final whistle blew, ending the game at 45 to 40, with China suffering a crushing defeat. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>

<p>The Group B final between the Philippines and Russia was a contest for the championship. Both teams possessed strong armor and sharp weapons, resulting in a brilliant performance. At the start, Philippine player Cupero displayed his skills, actively scoring two consecutive baskets. The Russian team temporarily lost its color, attempting to recover and tie the game. At this time, the atmosphere was tense throughout the court. Both sides were courageous and skilled. The first half ended with a score of 12 to 10, with the Russian team taking the lead. In the second half, the Philippine team used all its strength, and its momentum was shaken. However, this did not last long. The Russian troops pressed the enemy's territory and heavily besieged them. Stikin showed great skill, and Garokiv revealed his sharp edge. The Philippine army declined, and the front-line generals were severely punished and unable to achieve their ambitions. The Russian team's score soared to 32 to 20, winning the championship.</p>
<h3>First Division Football Match: Tung Wah Defeats Lancashire</h3>
<p>Tung Wah's smooth cooperation leads to a 3-2 victory. Today's match against formidable opponents from the French Business School requires effort.</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong Football Association First Division League match between Tung Wah and Lancashire, yesterday afternoon at 3:45 PM at the Recreation Ground, following the Junior Cup match between Yu Yau and Lancashire, approximately 2,000 spectators watched. In the first half, Tung Wah, with smooth cooperation across the team, took a 2-1 lead. In the second half, the Lancashire team's actions became increasingly rude, frequently kicking players, almost leading to an unpleasant ending. Fortunately, Tung Wah conceded, preventing a disaster. Both teams then scored one goal each, resulting in a final score of 3-2, with Tung Wah defeating Lancashire. Tung Wah will play against the French Business School today. If they can win, their chances of winning the championship will be greatly improved. However, the French Business School is a strong team, making it difficult for Tung Wah to win. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>First Goal Scored</p>
<p>At 3:45 PM, referee He Chunhui blew the whistle, and both sides immediately lined up to compete. The Lancashire team immediately began dribbling and passing the ball to the front line. Gu Shangxiang used his skills to intercept the ball. Dai Zhongjun attacked from the side, gaining possession and heading straight for the enemy camp. You Liang supported him on both sides, approaching the enemy territory. Upon reaching the heart of the area, Dai Linjing secretly released a powerful shot, and the enemy formation immediately fell, scoring the first goal. Zhang Jinhai was unwilling to be left behind, launching an attack from the wing, passing to Chen Dehui. After several passes, they had dribbled to the Lancashire territory. Chen then kicked the ball with force, but Bielicci Mei laid down to save it, but lost possession again, conceding another goal. The enemy's territory was constantly ravaged by our troops, and the blue-eyed men were all burning with anger, raising their arms and leaping up. Turner advanced into the territory, with Dunnud supporting the rear. Van Reley troops were ambushed on the periphery, gaining possession and shooting powerfully from the baseline. Lu Zhongen was momentarily caught off guard, and the ball went straight into the net from the left corner, pulling back one goal. From then on, both sides were noisy and bustling, without any significant achievements. The first half ended with Tung Wah taking a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Victory</p>
<p>Switching sides to continue the battle, Lancashire tried hard to counterattack. Bei Zhuang sent a long pass, and Dunnud ran forward to gain possession and shot, but Mu Dage raised his long legs and lightly deflected it. Tung Wah took the opportunity to attack the enemy. Zhang Jinhai, Chen Dehui, and Sun Jinshun successively knocked on the door, but all missed. Then, the foreign player Patton, with the assistance of Howard, scored a goal, tying the score at 2-2. Jia Youliang launched an attack on the right, sending a pass into the center. Linjing waited perfectly, scoring a goal from the penalty spot and returning triumphantly. The enemy team, seeing that they were losing, became angry and launched an attack, causing trouble in front of the Tung Wah goal. Fortunately, Li Guan defended well, without losing an inch of territory. After that, Tung Wah knocked on the enemy's door several times, but all were unsuccessful. Before long, the silver whistle sounded for a long time, and Tung Wah won 3-2. Today they meet the French Business School, fighting at the Recreation Ground. This game is a crucial key for Tung Wah to seek hegemony.</p>
<h3>Today's First Division Football: Tung Wah vs. Ever-Victorious French Business School</h3>
<p>3:45 PM this afternoon at the Recreation Ground: A Crucial Key to the First Division Championship. Portugal forfeits, and Yu Yau wins without effort.</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong Football Association First Division League, after Yu Yau drew 2-2 with Su Geer yesterday, the French Business School became the only remaining ever-victorious team. The team has won eight games and is likely to win the championship. However, is the French Business School an unbeatable team? This statement may not be entirely true. It is predicted that Tung Wah can win today. If so, Tung Wah's future also has its bright hope. Otherwise, the First Division Championship may not be touched by a Chinese team.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Football Association First Division match between Yu Yau and Portugal, originally scheduled for today at the Shen Garden, has been canceled due to Portugal's inability to form a team to compete. Yu Yau will win without effort. Yu Yau B's match against the English Army will still be played at Shen Garden at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>In addition to Tung Wah's 3-2 victory over Lancashire and Yu Yau's 2-2 draw with Su Geer in the First Division yesterday, the remaining three games were all between Western teams. The French Business School defeated the Jewish team by a large score of 11-1. The Jewish team is weak, and the French Business School's many goals indicate its strength. The Cokes team defeated the West Catch team, which defeated Portugal 9-3 last week, by a score of 5-2, indicating its significant improvement. Another match was Portugal's 4-3 victory over the West Business team. The recent results of the First Division are as follows:</p>
<p>First Division Situation</p>
<h3>Hong Kong First Division Football: South China Brothers Both Lose</h3>
<p>China defeats the Navy 3-1.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 14th Dispatch) In the Xun Chang Cup on the 14th, China defeated the Navy 3-1. All three goals were scored by Zhang Manrong. South China South and South China Hua each lost to the Kowloon Club and Lancashire team by three goals respectively. South China South did not field its best players on this day, leaving them to compete for the Special Silver Medal Championship on the 15th. The change was intentional. South China Hua's defeat was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Beating Lancashire: Yu Yau Wins the Junior Cup</h3>
<p>The Lancashire team has a strong momentum, taking a 2-1 lead in the first half. Yu Yau combines its strength to attack and reverses the defeat with a 4-3 victory.</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong Football Association Junior Cup final between Yu Yau and Lancashire, which took place at the Recreation Ground yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the two sides were evenly matched, and the battle was balanced. In the first half, Yu Yau was closely monitored by the enemy and unable to succeed, losing 2-1. In the second half, Yu Yau adopted a do-or-die determination and counterattacked fiercely, turning the game into a 2-2 tie. Finally, Yu Yau relied on a combined attack, turning the defeat into victory with a 3-1 score in the midst of the setback. The final result was 4-3, with Yu Yau eliminating Lancashire and winning the Junior Cup. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Sang Xuesi Scores the First Goal</p>
<p>When the time arrived, the hand-to-hand combat began. Yu Yau took the offensive first. Xu Wenkui passed the ball, and the forward Jilisheng caught up, but the enemy general Bilao Desh broke the border and passed the ball five times, passing through our army's station line and transporting it to a considerable area, passing it to Sang Xuesi on the left. Without panic, he calmly scored, opening the scoring. Yu Yau lost, and the whole army snatched it. Qisheng rose in the middle, and Hui Pei got the ball and rushed to the enemy's abdomen, but the big cat's feet were not accurate and failed to succeed. Qiaosheng came back and forced a corner kick. Dou Wen came, just right, and Wenkui waited with his spear, but it hit the goalpost and bounced back.</p>
<p>Xi Qiaosheng Pulls Back a Goal</p>
<p>Wenkui attacked from the middle, leading his generals, marching mightily towards the enemy. After dodging three passes, he fired a crossbow and hit the center, but it was offside and invalid. The crisis of the Lancashire team has passed, and the killing is fierce. The ball was passed from Zhang Rong from the inside, and Huo Fusi blocked it and shot it away, and then it was hit again, taking a 2-0 lead. The Yu Yau position was frequently lost, and the whole army was furious and vowed to avenge themselves. The foreign general committed a technical foul, and Zhang Rong took the penalty. Xi Qiaosheng intercepted the ball and attacked, and he lived up to expectations, knocking on the door at the 15-yard point and succeeding in one fell swoop, pulling back a goal. Not long after, the time was up, and the Lancashire team took a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Xu Wenkui Scores Again</p>
<p>After the break, changing sides to fight again, Yu Yau embraced the ambition of continuous battles and counterattacked fiercely. Xiao Meng transported troops on the right, but Luo Douwen's head did not hit, which was a pity. Wenkui continued to work hard, and Hui Pei passed over the gate again due to a head top. Cheng Yize rose again in the Dongshan Mountains, acting as a veteran who knew the way. After getting the ball, the ball hovered in front of the enemy's gate, and Dou Wen lost the opportunity twice, and the enemy did not lose an inch of land. Hui Pei was familiar with the road and re-entered the enemy camp. The enemy's internal impact was blocked, forcing a corner kick. Hui Pei opened it, just right, Wenkui darted out diagonally, and the shot entered the net, creating a draw. After the ball was kicked off in the middle line, the ball was blocked by Yu Yau again. Dou Wen transported it to a considerable area and shot it with force, and it hit the heart of the net again. Only one minute for two goals.</p>
<p>Yu Yau Won the Junior Cup</p>
<p>At this point, Yu Yau's momentum was extremely strong. Xi Qiaosheng raised the flag to transport troops, Luo Douwen planned the front and back, and Sun Huipei ambushed on the left and greeted them. After a ground shot, Binna missed again, and Yize seized the opportunity and sat down to gain the fisherman's profit. The Lancashire team then served as a trapped beast, and the forwards came straight in, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo along the way. Mai Tinglin was eager to save the ball, his hand was against the net ball, and he was fined 12 yards. Chong Keshen was fined to make it 4 to 3. The time was up, the horns sounded for a long time, and the army rested and closed. Yu Yau eliminated Lancashire and won the Junior Cup. The Hong Kong Football Association gave the cup on the spot, and Yu Yau was awarded the cup by Xi Qiaosheng on behalf of the team, and then dispersed in three calls. According to the previous session of the Cup, it was won by the Tung Wah Association.</p>
<h3>Yu Yau and Su Geer Draw</h3>
<p>Yu Yau's forward is sharp, but the Nara machine often loses opportunities. Su Geer's ball luck is very good, and the 2-2 draw is achieved.</p>
<p>In the Hong Kong Football Association's A Group Football League, Yu Yau competed against Su Geer at Shen Garden yesterday. Su Geer was originally very mediocre in Group A, while Yu Yau had a strong strength and was expected to win easily. However, things took an unexpected turn and ended in a 2-2 draw. Yesterday's judges, Yu Yau, started with a sharp forward and a strong momentum, while Su Geer had excellent ball luck, chasing and achieving a draw twice. In the last few minutes, Yu Yau repeatedly attacked fiercely, but still failed to succeed, which was probably also luck. The details of yesterday's game are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strong Momentum</p>
<p>The game started at 3:45. Yu Yau kicked off, attacking on the left. Yun Feng, Zhong Yongsen, passed long and short, approaching the enemy camp. Xiao Zhong raised his feet and kicked hard. The enemy's goal was alert and sought out a dangerous ball. The Russian army counterattacked, and Zhenxiang kicked a corner kick. Yu Yau besieged again, and a dangerous situation arose in front of the Russian army. Before long, Yongsen rode alone straight in, and Su Geer's defender was empty. Xiao Zhong entered the land of no one, and Bowie was inevitably flustered. The ball entered the net, and Yu Yau took the lead. The Russian army kicked off, and in a moment it was attacked by Yu Yau. The Nara machine frequently lost opportunities, and Su Geer took the opportunity to counterattack. Shutang blocked a corner kick, and Qilunski opened it. The landing point was just right, and Bowen Ning made a light dial. Zhang Rongcai was caught off guard and was defeated. One-on-one, the autumn colors are equally divided. After several back and forth, the first half ended.</p>
<p>Became a Draw</p>
<p>Changing places to fight again, Zhenhe took the lead, passing to Wang Shihua on the right, but he did not catch up and lost a good opportunity. Xue Yongyuan shot from a distance, but it rubbed against the crossbar and failed to hit. Yu Yau continued to work hard, and the Russian army was ravaged. In a moment, Zhenhe knocked on the door, and the enemy's door waved his arms to shoot it out. Yongsen waited right and pushed the boat along the river, and the ball had entered the net. Yu Yau surpassed again, and the Russian army worked hard to counterattack, but Yu Yau's rear guard was strict, and Su Geer failed to achieve his ambition. Zhenhe rose up again, like a hungry tiger pouncing on a sheep, and the enemy's door used softness to overcome hardness, lying on the ground to save it. Yu Yau declined, and the Russian army launched a fierce attack, and in a flash, it had reached the abdomen. 　Tunin tried his best to shoot, and it hit the red heart, and the one-to-two became a draw again. Yu Yau's generals were furious, and the garden attacked the Russian army, but Yu Yau's ball luck was not good, and he did not succeed in the end, and broke up in a draw.</p>
<p>Three Chinese Football Games Today</p>
<p>(Note) The three games of Taiping Hong·Gonglian Public Security·Zhonghui Guang were all postponed due to some reason.</p>
<h3>The Results of Yesterday's Industry and Commerce Football Match at the Municipal Sports Ground</h3>
<p>Prizes will be awarded this afternoon</p>
<p>(Ball) The municipal bridge won the Rongguang Maru with a score of than 〇 (Ming), and Xingtai defeated Yixin with a score of one to 〇; (German) the municipal Tu Huashang drew two to two; (Shou) Zhonghua defeated Xingtai with a score of one to 〇.</p>
<p>When Takahashi and Rongguang were competing, Rongguang lost two goals shortly after the start of the game because nine players were on the field and the line was not solid. Then, Takahashi player Zhuang Jifang accidentally collided with Rongguang player Zhang Guilin when he was taking the ball, and the referee penalized an arbitrary ball. At this time, Zhang Guilin suddenly hit Zhuang Jifang in the face twice with his hand. The referee ruled that his behavior was barbaric and ordered him to leave the field. He was still arguing endlessly, and after the persuasion of the captain of the team, he reluctantly left the field. It is heard that there is a Zhang Guilin in the Eastern District Little Football Competition Association who used to be a referee. I think it is the same name as this Zhang Guilin but not one person, otherwise, a person who serves as a referee would not know the rules of the game and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>In addition, the championships of each group in the association can be determined today. All the teams that win the championship can receive the championship trophy at the field this afternoon. The deposit of each team can also be collected from today.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Promulgated the Revised Registration Rules for Middle School Training Directors</h3>

<h3>The Approximate Number of National Secondary Schools in the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>Fewer than in the 21st year</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Education has instructed the compilation of the list of school names and addresses of national secondary schools in the 23rd year, which is compiled according to the survey summary of secondary schools in the 23rd year of various provinces and cities. However, only a few provinces and cities have not reported in detail, so it is impossible to accurately count. The reporter checked the number of schools in various provinces and cities and compared it with the number of secondary education statistics compiled by the Ministry of Education in the 21st year. For example, the number of schools in the fourteen provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guizhou, Henan, Jin, Shaanxi, Qinghai, Xin (Jiang) and Pingdeng has increased. The number of provinces and regions such as Xikang, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Weihaiwei has not increased or decreased. There is one less school in Zhejiang Province, and the number of schools in other provinces and cities is less than the number of schools in the 21st year. Although this is not enough to be used as statistics, according to this approximate number, it can also be seen that the national provinces and cities have middle school (divided into high school, junior high school and high junior high school), normal (divided into formal normal schools and simple normal schools for short-term normal schools) and vocational (divided into senior and junior) education facilities. The approximate number is for reference only. The approximate number is as follows:</p>
<p>(Description) The middle school part includes provincial, public, joint, private, county, national, municipal, and private secondary schools that have not been filed with the Ministry of Education. The normal school includes provincial, joint, county, private, simple normal school, including rural normal school and simple rural normal school. Vocational schools include provincial, county, municipal and private schools.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (200)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>In the third act, the prince's herald came to try the shoe. Tandy, still wearing the imperial clothes, went on stage and blew a tin "horn," which was quite pleasant to hear. Each of the proud sisters wanted to try the shoe. Nan-en insisted on pretending to cut off a toe with a knife, doing it so realistically that the herald was startled and begged her to "lift the child." (Note 10) After everyone failed, Cinderella was called. She came in wearing half an apron and slipped her foot into the shoe, happily announcing, "I am Cinderella." (Note 11)</p>
<p>Little Mei laughed and asked for her sister's forgiveness, but Nan-en had always loved the feeling of tragedy. Going a step further than the original story, she pretended to faint on the ground, but comfortably lay there, fully watching the unfinished part of the play. This part was not long, because the prince ran in, knelt on the ground, and kissed the hand of the golden girl with deep enthusiasm. At the same time, the herald blew his horn loudly, almost deafening the audience. The curtain didn't have a chance to come down again, because Cinderella ran straight to her father from the stage and shouted, "Didn't I do well?" And the prince and the herald used the tin "horn" and wooden sword for a round of martial arts.</p>
<p>Everyone exclaimed, "This is wonderful!" When the revelry calmed down a little, Naide brought out a violin.</p>

<h3>Grains Speculation Shifts to Flour and Wheat, Futures Soar, Spot Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Since government bonds have lost their speculative nature, we knew early on that speculation would concentrate on yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat. Indeed, since the changes in the European situation, the Japanese have been enthusiastic, and financial institutions and large speculators have first attacked yarn and cotton, and then turned to flour and wheat. The outlet for funds is always in the speculative market. Despite all the talk of developing industry and commerce, what use is it?</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, spot prices remained stable, while futures from June onwards showed a consistent upward trend. The origin of the price surge is that outside interests, such as securities and yarn traders, have mostly concentrated their efforts after the European incident and are buying in large quantities. If we take the spot price as a ratio, then this increase is purely driven by speculation. Therefore, after the opening price, although trading in March and April was smooth, the price did not fluctuate. Starting in June, sales were unprecedented. June rose from 3.08 yuan, step by step. July and August also showed the same increase, rising by three to four cents compared to the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, spot prices still saw little change, but when trading reached August, securities and gold traders emerged again and surged forward, raising the price by two to three cents compared to the morning. New buyers remained exceptionally active, but large factories were also selling heavily, so from the third session onwards, the price surge gradually eased. Looking at the current situation, if the buying trend from outside interests does not stop, there is still a risk of further surges. Total transactions for the day were estimated at 1.4 million bags.</p>
<p>When the wheat futures market opened in the morning, the market for each month was initially calm. Because foreign wheat was only selling for about 10 cents, and the weather was also sunny and warm, buyers seemed to be pausing. However, the current buyers are no longer based on actual sales, but purely on international trends. Moreover, most of the large buyers are outsiders who have nothing to do with the industry. Initially, the price did not move because outside interests were inactive. Later, as securities and yarn traders bought without price limits, the market showed an upward trend. When the market opened in the afternoon, the momentum from the morning continued, and coupled with the sharp rise in the flour market, trading was brisk and the market rose step by step. July and August rose by 11 to 12 cents. Fortunately, customers in the producing areas were selling, and the market calmed down slightly. However, if foreign wheat is no longer continuously supplied, the influence of outsiders cannot be ignored. Spot wheat owners, seeing the soaring flour and wheat futures, also want to raise prices by 5 cents, but factories are watching and not moving.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat Market Conditions: Due to a large sandstorm in the southwest, the affected area is said to be smaller than last year. Due to European news and various rumors, price fluctuations may be greater than before.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Suffers from Oversupply, Foreign Rice May Be Purchased</h3>
<p>Ke Xian rice continues to arrive from various ports along the Yangtze River, especially from Jiangxi. After the Shanghai market soared, all ports heard the news and shipped rice, but actual sales are still not as strong as those of the hoarders. Although hoarders are buying a lot, it is not an actual outlet. Now that hoarding is stagnant and they want to sell, the market will immediately collapse. The entire market only saw the street buy 70 bags of Jiangxi rice and 124 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, totaling less than 200 bags, and the price immediately plummeted by 15 to 20 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign rice shipments to Japan are in high demand. Now that Ke Xian rice has repeatedly fallen, merchants dare not continue to support it. Yesterday, Siamese rice was priced at several yuan and 80 cents, a decrease of about 20 cents. Also, 100 bags of Karachi machine-milled rice and 1,300 bags of small-grade rice were priced, also following the decline. Yesterday, 950 tons of Siamese rice futures for March and April were resold, also down by 5 to 8 cents.</p>
<p>In Ningbo, new rice was priced too cheaply when it first came on the market, and was transported out. Recently, there has been a shortage of rice. It is rumored that a request has been made to allocate 3 million yuan and passports for 500,000 bags of foreign rice to purchase foreign rice for relief. It is said that the Shanghai market has been receiving a lot of rice for days, but it is difficult to find an outlet. The lack of flexible adjustment is evident here.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Prices Fall by 30 to 40 Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs continued to pour in, totaling over 80 sources (with a total of over 17,000 stones of goods), so the market continued to weaken. The price of thick early japonica rice fell by another 30 to 40 cents. Although some Qingdao and Weihai gangs were still trying to buy 4,000 bags of thin indica rice, there was too much left over from before, and people were inevitably discouraged, so the higher-priced rice continued to fall by 7 cents, the medium and lower grades fell by 30 cents, and Du Yang sharp rice also continued to fall by 30 cents, similar to Yin Yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 50 to 60 boats arrived from various gangs downriver. The market was stagnant, and the price of white japonica rice fell by 30 to 40 cents, Yin Yuan fell by a little over 20 to 30 cents, Bian Yuan fell by a little over 10 cents, early indica fell by a little over 30 cents, thin indica fell by a little over 20 cents, and Yang Du Bu Xian rice and others were all down by a little over 20 cents, Ke Xian sharp rice was down by 10 cents, and the rest also showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Cakes Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Spot Buyers Turn to Wait and See</p>
<p>The prices of standard soybean cakes in various markets continue to surge. Since the European situation has become tense, speculators have flocked to the grain and flour exchanges. In addition, increased cake sales have made the demand for soybeans exceed supply, further pushing up the market. After a telegram from Dalian yesterday stated that prices had risen again, speculators became even more active. When prices were heard in the morning, each level had already seen a sharp rise. Following reports of rising prices in the near term, buying sentiment became even stronger. In the afternoon, each session saw an increase. At the closing price, standard cakes rose by 20 to 30 cents, standard beans rose by 12 to 30 cents, and standard oil rose by 30 to 45 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign sesame seeds have been stagnant for a long time. On the day before yesterday, Jardine Matheson purchased 100 tons for delivery in March at a price of 11.10 yuan, which is 40 cents higher than the lowest price last month, due to the soaring oil prices. However, it is still difficult to predict whether future sales will continue. The price of soybean cakes is likely to rise rather than fall. However, sellers are stubbornly holding on, and prices are rising rapidly, causing buyers to lack interest, so the market was not as lively yesterday as it was the day before. The overall trend has become one of holding on.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Inventory Declines, Short Sellers of Standard Yarn Panic</h3>
<p>Opening in the Afternoon, High Closing Prices Found to be Plunging</p>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening, and the price surge is exceptionally sharp. Sales of spot yarn have been strong recently, resulting in a significant reduction in yarn inventory. The delivery period for this month is approaching, and short sellers lack chips. The long side has already moved the yarn stored in warehouses. As a result, short sellers are panicking, and the near-term price jumps are becoming more intense. When the market opened in the afternoon, high closing prices were found for June, July, and August, and profit-taking caused a sharp drop in the market. However, spot yarn patterns are extremely tight.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Initially Rises, Then Falls</p>
<p>When the standard yarn market opened in the morning, there was no progress in any month. Due to the mediocre overseas cotton market and pressure from sellers, prices fell slightly by 40 to 50 cents. The second session was flat. When trading reached the third session, long-term prices jumped by over 2 yuan because a certain party came to drag in a large amount of yarn, and the selling price of spot yarn soared by 3 yuan. Due to the high cost of raw materials, factories were reluctant to easily sell cotton yarn. As a result, floating shorts panicked, and buying sentiment became even stronger, causing market prices to soar. As a result, each month rose by 1.20, 1.40, 1.60, and 1.80 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the near-month trend was tighter, and sellers showed signs of panic. The second session rose step by step. The June contract broke through the 210 yuan level. Unexpectedly, the long side unloaded at the close, and the market suddenly reversed, with increasing pressure from sellers. However, the base price of spot yarn was extremely tight. As a result, each month fell by 90 cents to 1.10 and 1.60 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning, except for this month, which rose by 40 cents. It was found that Tongji sold 2,250 bales, Daji 3,750 bales, Feng 2,300 bales, Yichang 1,450 bales, Shengyuan 950 bales, Senkang 1,050 bales, and Xincheng 2,600 bales.

<p>Spot Yarn Soars by 3 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still strong. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 2,042 bales throughout the day. The selling price soared by 3 yuan, and thread rose by 4 yuan. The buying amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3>Longs Take Profits, Cotton Traders Tend to Sell</h3>
<p>The cotton market is relatively stable. Because of the consecutive days of skyrocketing prices, profit-taking longs unloaded, and the market was slightly softer. Later, the yarn market soared, bringing up the cotton market. However, the financial community has a strong bullish sentiment for the cotton market, while general traders tend to sell, and the competition between the two sides is becoming more intense.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Near-Firm, Far-Weak</p>
<p>When the standard cotton market opened in the morning, US cotton fell by 3 to 11 points, Indian cotton rose and fell, fluctuating between 0.25 and 0.57 rupees, and Osaka Three-Grade Cotton fell by 20 to 30 cents. In the third session, due to the skyrocketing yarn market, the current month broke through the 4 yuan level. As a result, each month rose by 5 cents to 35 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation was still stable. General traders tended to sell. It was rumored that there would be new Indian cotton set to open, but banks were still dragging in. Until the third session, longs unloaded, and the market plummeted. As a result, each month fell by 20, 30, and 40 cents compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that Dafu sold 3,000 dan, Chengji 1,400 dan, Tongji 4,600 dan, Daji 9,200 dan, Mingde 1,600 dan, Zhenda 2,500 dan, Hexing 7,700 dan, Tongfeng 8,300 dan, Renfeng 3,700 dan, Yichang 6,300 dan, Xincheng 6,300 dan, and Changhe 3,800 dan.

<h3>US Cotton Initially Firm, Then Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and traders were watching. Each month ranged from unchanged to a rise of 2 points. Initially, traders bought at limited prices. Cotton Corporation did not sell the three-month contract, and the market was firm. Later, there were purchases of Cotton Corporation, two sets of outgoing futures, longs taking profits, and foreign merchants selling, gradually weakening. Hester estimated that factory usage for this week was 261,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 382,000 bales. The closing was flat and weak. Spot prices fell by 8 points, and futures fell by 3 to 11 points. Spot prices for British cotton were unchanged, and futures fell by 12 points.

<h3>Finance April Contract Launches, Standard Gold Sees Sudden Purchase by Major Players</h3>
<p>Market Initially Weak, Then Strong, Resulting in a Rebound of 70 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday was the rollover date for the gold market, and people were slightly flustered.

However, with the White Silver Balance Tax revealed to be 0.25 higher, there was still a rebound. After this, the rollover discount became more expensive, and selling sentiment in the market was still strong, once falling. Unexpectedly, major players suddenly came to buy bars, and Chinese businessmen also bought US dollars, tightening the domestic market. Buying sentiment rose sharply, and buyers rose with the wind, rising steadily. Finally, with the discount being high, sellers took advantage of the high prices to act, resulting in a pullback, but floating shorts painfully filled their positions, and the afternoon was still stable.

HSBC Bank's appointed listing revealed that both British and US currencies were flat, and the situation fluctuated. Japanese banks blocked out East exchange, and banks also blocked US dollars, so the White Silver Balance Tax rose by 0.25, but the overall trend was difficult to be optimistic about.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Market Volatility Persists, Type Wu Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained extremely stable. Although the market sentiment was weak and seemed on the verge of collapse, selling pressure was not strong. A slight increase in buying immediately stabilized it. The situation in Europe continues to worsen due to Germany's strong stance. Japan's plans for South China, though still disguised, have become increasingly blatant. The precarious situation of our country intensifies the sense of crisis. It is truly remarkable that public bonds can maintain a relatively stable position under such circumstances. It would be most fortunate if this consolidating and brewing situation could be sustained. There is a genuine fear that a sudden surge would lead to a painful lack of buyers. Yesterday's activity remained in a consolidating and brewing phase. Due to thin trading, both buyers and sellers were few and far between. While there were purchases of the 11th issue, each incremental increase in price was met with selling as sellers sought to capitalize on any rise. As a result, market prices consistently failed to rise. Even the 4th issue saw some selling, with prices only fluctuating by a small margin of one to four jiao at the opening. Apart from this slight volatility, there was little to no movement. This repeated consolidation, with its suppressed energy, raises concerns about a potential breakout if the environment changes. Yesterday's market results showed a slight decline of five fen to three jiao, while Type Wu remained completely unchanged. The total transaction volume was 2.87 million yuan. The price fluctuations are compared in the table below: (Unit: yuan; Transaction Unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<p>New York Stocks Discover This Year's New Low Price</p>
<p>A report from the New Feng Yang Company states that yesterday's New York stock market experienced a price decline with active trading. US commercial news was quite positive, but fears of unexpected events during the upcoming weekend holiday led to preemptive selling. As a result, many stocks reached new lows for the year. Railroad, utility, automobile, and liquor stocks all fell. Stocks on the small exchange also declined. The bond market was slightly lower, with railroad bonds, US government bonds, and foreign government bonds particularly weak. The total daily trading volume was 2.66 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<h3>Oilcloth: Raw Materials Rise Daily, Sesame Oil Increases Gradually</h3>
<p>Guidetown Oil Sold at 22.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, sesame oil prices have been rising gradually due to the deteriorating international situation and soaring commodity prices, including the raw materials for sesame oil. Last week, Hangbangban sent 20 dan of Huaiyuan goods, initially priced at 21.2 yuan, later increasing to 21.5 yuan. This week, the rising trend intensified as local merchants collectively took action. Given the daily increase in raw material costs and the scarcity of sources from various producing areas, merchants have become increasingly firm in their resolve. On Wednesday, 300 tins of Guidetown goods were sold at a market price of 22.3 yuan. However, local demand remained unmet, so trading continued yesterday with 400 tins sold at a price of 22.5 yuan. The situation is quite brisk, and prices have already increased by 13 yuan in the forward market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Sugar Continues to Rise by One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild marked prices according to the week. Due to the fact that it was Saturday, there was no loading today, and transactions were even scarcer. The current price of 24 grade coarse white sugar for immediate delivery is 22.3 yuan, with a transshipment cost of 7.1 jiao. Dongchi (MS) mark is at 15.8 yuan, 8th grade imported white sugar for immediate delivery is at 21.65 yuan, with a transshipment cost of 6.9 jiao, and 9th grade YPO mark is also at 21.65 yuan, with a transshipment cost of 6.6 jiao. All lack transactions. The price of Ben Bai Zhen Ji No. 1 is at 20.9 yuan, without any fluctuation. The price of domestic Chaoqing sugar is rising again due to the contraction of the Shantou exchange rate, but actual sales have not yet turned brisk, so the marked price shows a clear state of fatigue. Due to the thin inventory of Hainan red sugar and the fact that its sales volume are deeper than other mixed red sugars, recent sales have been active. Yesterday, it was heard that Yu Fengheng offered a batch, the number of which is unknown, at a price of 12.6 yuan, another increase of one jiao. The rest have not been offered further.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Drastic Reduction in Woolen Imports</h3>
<p>Scarce Arrivals in Spring and Summer Seasons, Shortage of Fresh Patterns</p>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen market was stable, and the price remained firm. Transactions were extremely lively. Half of the slightly cheaper spot goods from foreign firms have already been sold. According to the survey, arrivals in the spring and summer seasons are scarce, and imports of woolen fabrics and woolen goods from various countries have greatly decreased. The sentiment is very firm, and merchants are unwilling to sell at lower prices. Even in the case of Japanese goods, at present, only orders are being placed, and there are no large-scale imports. Therefore, there is a perceived shortage of fresh-patterned woolens.</p>

<h3>What Is the True Meaning of the Boy Scouts?</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>Children! Why do we organize Boy Scouts? Does organizing Boy Scouts mean that we wear beautiful uniforms, carry long round sticks, blow melodious trumpets, beat rhythmic drums, stick out our chests, bulge out our stomachs, and swagger to show off to others? No, it is not!</p>
<p>So, what exactly is the true meaning of Boy Scouts? A Boy Scout is a child who enjoys outdoor life, focuses on common sense training, and develops morality, intelligence, physical fitness, social skills, and aesthetics in a balanced way. In the nation, he is a good future citizen with national spirit, political knowledge, and productive abilities. He is also a savior of the oppressed masses in society and a sympathizer for realizing world peace. "Wisdom, Benevolence, Courage," and "Be Prepared" are its creeds. Fostering children's spontaneous nature and encouraging their ability to be independent and self-governing is its aim.</p>
<p>Children! Today is Boy Scout Day. I hope you all join the Boy Scouts and remember the true meaning of the Boy Scouts and put it into practice.</p>
<h3>Four Chinese Boy Scout Martyrs</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>Children! Do you know the tragic story of the Four Martyrs? Let me tell you. They are the four brave warriors of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps: Luo Yunxiang, Ying Wenda, Bao Zhengwu, and Mao Zhengxiang.</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident, disaster spread throughout Shanghai. The enemy's artillery fire roared incessantly, threatening to destroy the bustling Zhabei! Fellow countrymen who could not escape were crying out for help in grief and despair! Ah! What a tragic event! Their most important rescue work was established at this moment. Each person swore an oath of "Loyalty to the country, rescuing the distressed, and disregarding all sacrifices." Under the command of the corps leader, the entire group mobilized, with teams holding high the Red Cross flag, beginning their service in Zhabei.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 31st, the four of them were sent out by the corps leader. They did not return until evening and were killed in a murky and unexplained manner! To this day, the bones of the Four Martyrs are still unknown. Later, local people built a symbolic tomb for the Four Martyrs to commemorate these loyal and brave Boy Scout martyrs. Boy Scouts throughout China and the world expressed their deepest condolences. In Shouxiu</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Brotherhood Song</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouxiu</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, vice president of the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts and president of the Examination Yuan, composed a Brotherhood Song for the Boy Scouts. The lyrics are very heroic. Now, I am specially recording them for you to see:</p>
<p>Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Love my body; love my family; love my country; love my people. Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Love my body, strive to be a complete person, wise, benevolent, and courageous, living up to the good youth. Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Love my family, parents gave me life, supreme virtue and morality, do not take lightly. Repay the kindness of parents. Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Love my country, sacrifice for the country! The great road to saving the country: nationalism; democracy; and people's livelihood! Red blood and loyal heart, the blue sky and white sun shine brightly, freedom and equality. Fight for the nation! Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Love my people, sacrifice yourself to help others, be courteous, righteous, virtuous, and united in heart, do one good deed every day, do good deeds with sincerity. Be loyal and trustworthy; the whole world will be filled with spring. Boy Scouts! Boy Scouts! Love my body; love my family; love my country; love my people.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of the Boy Scouts</h3>
<p>— Xiao Enxun</p>
<p>"Boy Scouts" is a children's group organization in the world that imitates military training, so it is called "Boy Scouts." This is what we all know. But this kind of organization is very common, and every country in the world has it. What are the benefits? The benefits of the "Boy Scouts" are many. Now, let's take the "character" aspect as an example; this kind of organization can enable children to live a collective life and have discipline, solidarity, bravery, and the virtue of diligence and frugality. Let's take the "work" aspect as an example; it can enable children to develop the habit of serving society, and have the ability to strive, have a strong physique, have a sense of justice and courage, and have a persevering will. Therefore, its benefits are not only in cultivating morality and acting righteously, and serving society; but also can enable children to be trained from an early age, creating a foundation for a strong country! Do you think it is great?</p>
<p>However, what is the history of the "Boy Scouts"? Who founded it? Now I will tell you, children, this brief history of the "Boy Scouts"!</p>
<p>It is said that when the British and South African War broke out in 1899, there was a very brave and intelligent soldier in the British army that set off. His name was Baden-Powell. Although he lived a hard life in the army, exposed to the wind and dew, his spirit of erudition and good thinking continued to be vigorous. He used everything he encountered in the army for years as research material. One day, he thought that although the British army and the South African War had the upper hand, the British people were mostly indulging in leisure and pleasure and could not endure hardship. The soldiers were also inevitably infected with this habit, which was inappropriate. So he wanted to organize "Boy Scouts" and train children in a military manner to cultivate their strong physique and spirit of hard work. Unfortunately, he was busy with military service and had no time to proceed. So it was not until 1907 that he gathered children and trained them on a secluded island, which finally realized his wish. This is the process of the founding of the "Boy Scouts." But no one knew his intention until the following year, when he published a book called "Scouting for Boys," and then the world realized that the "Boy Scouts" cause made such a great contribution to society and the country. Therefore, as the news spread, all countries in the world competed to hold it, and the organization of the "Boy Scouts" became common throughout the world.</p>
<h3>Thermometer</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Every day after school, Min'er must read the newspaper, so he can be familiar with national affairs. He saw the weather report from the observatory and asked his older brother Cong'er in confusion;</p>
<p>"Brother, the report said that yesterday was 20 degrees, which is supposed to be very cold, but yesterday didn't seem that cold. What's the reason?"</p>
<p>"You made a mistake. You read the Fahrenheit thermometer, but the temperature reported by the observatory is on the Celsius thermometer."</p>
<p>"What is the difference between the Fahrenheit thermometer and the Celsius thermometer?"</p>
<p>"The freezing point of the Fahrenheit thermometer is 32 degrees, and the boiling point is 212 degrees. The distance between these two points is equally divided into 180 parts. The freezing point of the Celsius thermometer is 0 degrees, and the boiling point is 100 degrees. The distance between these two points is equally divided into 100 parts, so one degree on the Fahrenheit scale equals five-ninths of a degree on the Celsius scale."</p>
<p>"How is a thermometer made? Can we make one ourselves?"</p>
<p>"A thermometer is a very thin and uniform glass tube with one end blown into a bulb shape. The bulb and part of the tube are filled with mercury, but some use alcohol. When the mercury or alcohol is heated, it expands, and part of the mercury in the tube flows out. At this time, the opening of the tube is sealed to prevent air from entering, so that the mercury can expand and contract freely without being affected by air pressure. As for making one yourself, it's very difficult. Why? Because I think it's difficult to make such a precise and accurate glass tube in China."</p>
<p>"How do they mark the degrees on the glass tube of the thermometer?"</p>
<p>"Immerse the bulb of the thermometer in melting ice. When you see the end of the mercury thread drop to a certain point and stop, mark the position of the thread end on the tube wall. This position is what we commonly call the freezing point. Then immerse the bulb of the thermometer in boiling water vapor. When you see the end of the mercury thread rise to a certain point and stop, mark the position of the thread end on the tube wall. This is called the boiling point."</p>
<p>"Brother, is a mercury thermometer better or an alcohol thermometer?"</p>
<p>"Mercury thermometers and alcohol thermometers each have their own advantages, but they also inevitably have their own shortcomings. Because mercury can withstand very high temperatures, about 300 degrees Celsius, but below 39 degrees Celsius, it will solidify and lose its function. Alcohol cannot withstand high temperatures, and it will turn into steam above 78 degrees Celsius, but it will not freeze even at 130 degrees below zero Celsius, so mercury thermometers are mostly used in temperate and tropical zones, and alcohol thermometers are most suitable for use in cold zones."</p>

<p>— Qian Kechang</p>
<h3>The Flying Lantern</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>Children, I'm going to tell you how to make a flying lantern.</p>
<p>"Hey! Can a lantern fly?" Maybe you'll be surprised.</p>
<p>But I would never lie to you: The lantern can not only fly, but also fly very high, like a star in the sky.</p>
<p>And it is very suitable to make flying lanterns in cold weather. Because this flying lantern needs to use fire, and it needs to be released on snowy nights; and in terms of materials, you don't need to use anything that freezes your hands (such as water, etc.). Therefore, making this kind of thing in cold weather will definitely give you pleasure.</p>
<p>Step 1: Please find a three-foot-long thin bamboo strip, tie it into a circle, and tie a thin lead wire in the middle as a diameter, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Step 2: Please buy a piece of paper, red or green is fine. Fold the paper in half into a cylinder, and the size of the mouth should be equal to the bamboo circle. Paste the sides and top tightly to prevent it from opening, and then paste it on the bamboo circle to form a pocket, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Step 3: Please find a piece of cotton wool and tie it to the diameter lead wire of the closed mouth. The entire flying lantern is completed, as shown in the figure.</p>
<p>When releasing it, it should be done outdoors at night. First, dip some kerosene on the cotton wool. One person holds the flying lantern upright, and the other person lights the fire. The cotton wool catches fire, and all the air inside the lantern is burned away by the fire, so the constitution becomes lighter. At this time, people gently let go, and the lantern gradually rises, rising all the way to the high sky. It's really interesting to watch. Two things to pay attention to:</p>
<p>You can't release it on windy nights, not only will you not be able to release it, but there is also a risk of it burning away.</p>
<p>You can't release it where there are grass sheds, to prevent fire.</p>
<h3>Decoloring Solution</h3>
<p>— Sanmin</p>
<p>Children, do you feel annoyed when you write the wrong word—not with a pencil but with a pen—and you have to ink it out? It's too ugly. Should you throw it away and rewrite it? It's too wasteful, time-consuming, and energy-consuming. Now there is a way to erase the handwriting. This is a chemical aqueous solution, and its production is very convenient. A brief description is as follows:</p>
<p>Materials: Potassium permanganate; dilute sulfuric acid; oxalic acid; water</p>
<p>Equipment: Two stoppered glass bottles, one cup.</p>
<p>Production method: First dissolve an appropriate amount of oxalic acid in water to make it very dilute, and pour it into a glass bottle. Then dissolve the potassium permanganate in water to form a purple solution, add a little dilute sulfuric acid to it, and pour it into another glass bottle. This completes the work.</p>
<p>Usage: Use a glass rod (because iron or copper will react with sulfuric acid) to dip some of the purple solution and apply it to the wrongly written words, and the handwriting will disappear. Then apply some of the oxalic acid from the other bottle as well, so there will be no stains on the paper.</p>
<p>Reason: Because potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid generate manganese sulfate and nascent oxygen, and nascent oxygen reacts with the ink to generate white organic matter. At the same time, manganese sulfate is also white, so it can make the handwriting disappear. (Also, oxalic acid is sometimes not needed, because it only prevents stains.)</p>

<h3>My School</h3>
<p>— Li Xiaocen</p>
<p>My school is in a place with beautiful scenery and fresh air. On both sides are tall trees and beautiful flowers, and the ground is covered with green grass. Behind the school is a river: the river water is emerald green and lovely, quiet and unparalleled. There are many small fish in the river, swimming around, very lively. There are also several willows beside the river, their shadows reflected in the water, very cute. Speaking of the interior of our school, many new teachers and new students have been replaced. All the teachers do their best to teach us. The students also love each other and no one is impolite. The school's buildings have also changed greatly. The classrooms are very clean and tidy, and there are many new posters on the walls. This is equipped to increase our knowledge and learning. Not far from the school, there are also campuses, ball fields, and sports fields, everything is well-equipped. Our school is so lovely!</p>
<p>Small Science Questions</p>
<h3>Why are Glass Cups More Easily Broken in Cold Weather?</h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>A type of glass cup that is usually used for tea has no problems in summer, but it is not the same in winter. Often, the good glass cup is cracked open. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Children probably haven't forgotten the principle of thermal expansion and contraction that the teacher talked about in natural science class. It must be known that glass cups also expand and contract with heat, but the human eye cannot see it. Because winter is very cold, the glass cup shrinks very small. If hot water is suddenly poured in, the inside of the glass cup is heated, and it expands immediately, but the outside does not expand because the weather is too cold. In this way, one side wants to expand, and the other side does not, so the glass cup is squeezed and cracked. Now, turning it around, why doesn't the glass cup crack in hot weather? This is because the degree of difference between the heat of the hot weather and the heat of the hot water is much smaller than in winter, so although the inside wants to expand and the outside does not expand, the difference between them is very small, so it will naturally not crack. So we understand this principle. In cold weather in winter, if we want the cup not to crack, we can only heat the cup with warm water first, and then pour in hot tea. Because the glass cup has been heated by warm water, the inside has already expanded to a considerable degree, so if you pour in hot tea again, it will not crack due to the large difference in cold and heat.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Righteous Dog (11)</h3>
<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Old Dashi had said to Xiao Nanluo in his bed several times: "Nanluo, when you grow up, if you can keep this house and this small piece of land, support yourself, and work hard, and your neighbors call you a landlord, then, even if I sleep underground, I will be very satisfied."</p>
<p>In the imagination of an ordinary farmer: if a person can live in his own house, cultivate his own land, and eat his own bread, that is the highest goal. Old Dashi wandered around when he was young, but returned empty-handed, so when he was old, he only hoped to live quietly in one place and die in this place, and he hoped that his dear grandson would be like this.</p>
<p>But Xiao Nanluo didn't say anything. What he dreamed of was not cultivating that small piece of land, living in that small house, or listening to his neighbors call him a landlord. His whole mind was focused on the spire of the temple, and he didn't think about anything else. But he only told his friend Bodeshi about his thoughts, and every time at dawn, they went out to work together in the morning mist, or lay down in the reeds by the water to rest after returning, he always leaned close to the dog's ear and said softly.</p>
<p>In addition to Bodeshi, Xiao Nanluo had another friend who could tell him his thoughts. This friend was Xiao Ailuo, who lived in the old mill in Gefu, and his father was the owner of this mill, which was considered the richest farmer in the village.</p>
<p>Xiao Ailuo was a beautiful child with a gentle round face with the color of roses, and a pair of dark eyes, like a Spaniard, very lovely.</p>
<p>Xiao Ailuo was often with Xiao Nanluo and Bodeshi. They played in the fields together, ran in the snow, they collected daisies and blueberries together, they went to the gray old church together, and they often sat next to the fireplace in the mill together.</p>

<h3>Social Education and Art Cultivation</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianbai</p>
<p>The target of social education is the entire population of society, from young children to adults, from tangible to intangible, from life's experiments to life's entities, from the pursuit of knowledge to the performance of morality, from individual units to complex groups, all of which fall within its scope. From its attributes, it can be divided into several aspects: moral, intellectual, physical, emotional, and technical. The driving force of these aspects is mainly emotional education. With the utmost sincerity, the will and purpose can be unified, and the structure of society can be perfectly formed. Art is the symbol of building emotions and the crystallization of expressing emotions. The brushstrokes of the universe, the beauty of mountains and rivers, and the spirit of our nation's love of beauty have created many great achievements. Now, we must use the cultivation of true beauty to express the utmost sincerity, to satisfy the desire for progress, to train healthy members of society, and to promote the glory of our great nation.</p>
<p>Humanity's pursuit of knowledge and love of beauty are equally innate. Beauty can make humans feel interest and pleasure. In the rhythm of interest and pleasure, the entire character is cultivated and harmonized. It can be seen that art is a tool for implementing social education. In social life, humans inevitably feel bored and dry. To regulate this boredom and dryness, the only way is to seek spiritual comfort, and the art aspects of painting, poetry, sculpture, film, drama, etc., are most sufficient to make people appreciate and enjoy. After humans accept this kind of aesthetic appreciation and entertainment, they are imperceptibly and gradually influenced. Interest becomes strong. In addition to enriching knowledge and skills, they also receive moral cultivation. There are no wanton and unrestrained thoughts, no deceitful and insidious, violent and arrogant means, sincere and perfect, helping each other to do good, social order gradually tends to be peaceful, and the foundation of the country is consolidated and stable.</p>
<p>Since the public in society needs the cultivation of art so much, art cannot be too far away from the public. In addition to its own development, art should also strive for the popularization and universalization of art. Art exhibitions, concerts, etc., should be held frequently to enhance the public's ability to appreciate art and to enable the public's sentiments to be influenced by art, music, etc., and to inspire ambition and invigorate the spirit. In this extraordinary period when the nation is about to perish, it is not only in the increase of production and the enrichment of national strength, but also in the promotion of national culture and the cultivation of social morality, that we bear a major mission. Art is the driving force of culture and the tool for cultivating social morality. Since public training is of utmost importance, the promotion and implementation of art is, of course, even more important.</p>
<h3>Mutual Encouragement with Fellow Members of the Chinese Art Association</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>In recent years, the art movement has not been lonely among our countrymen. Art societies and associations have sprung up like mushrooms after a spring rain. When they were first established, they were as fiery and grand as anything ever seen; however, before long, either due to spiritual decline, or due to a lack of material resources, or due to various other adverse circumstances, they eventually dissipated and disappeared. The lessons of the past are many, and the concerns for the future grow deeper. The organization of this association can be completed by just one or two people calling out, but how to maintain it for a long time and how to make a difference and contribute to this artistic environment cannot be solely borne by one or two people.</p>
<p>Any group must have the spirit of the entire group to have the ability of the entire body. If every member of the group can take everything about the group as their goal and do their best, then the group will become strong and powerful. However, how to cultivate this kind of morality among the members of the group requires the few initially responsible members to set an example and gradually guide and influence them. This naturally takes time. When this time is reached, the foundation of the spirit of the entire group is laid, and the development of the ability of the entire group becomes grand. And the life of the group naturally continues to grow and increase with the cause of the group. I would like to encourage all the members of this association to work together.</p>
<h3>Starting from Our Own Position</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>— Written to Commemorate the Establishment of the Chinese Art Association —</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the comrades who initiated the Chinese Art Association are either artists or people who are enthusiastic about promoting art. Seeing the art world they are involved in or passionate about being like a plate of loose sand, sinking day by day, and perhaps facing elimination in the near future, how can they not be heartbroken and try to save it? The establishment of this Chinese Art Association may be the infallible remedy that the comrades have come up with after racking their brains. Regardless of whether it works or not, since there is no better method available at the moment, we might as well give it a try.</p>
<p>Those so-called painting societies in Shanghai probably still have many names in their minds. But what has been left behind? I am afraid that besides an empty name that does not evoke much goodwill, there are also some unclear accounts, unfair handling of affairs, leaders who regard it as a personal organization, members who only talk but are unwilling to take responsibility... impressions like these that are not very good? But the times are different now. If the art world does not strive to save itself, it will sink into an abyss from which it cannot recover. Does the art world have the ability to save itself now? Is there a determination to save itself? That depends on the achievements of this "newly born" Chinese Art Association!</p>
<p>The success or failure of the Chinese Art Association is certainly a matter of life and death for the Chinese art world, but I am not one who only shouts for others to work hard and rush to the front line, while I hide in the cellar smoking opium. Although I am not qualified to be called an artist, I have been following in the footsteps of artists for twenty years. Needless to say, the prosperity or decline of the art world is also directly related to me. Although I have never been willing to be used to play minor roles and cheer for others, I am very willing to be a member of the brave warriors. Although my ability is pitifully weak, I harbor a great ambition to rescue the art world from the water and fire and bring it to a better place. Therefore, I very much hope that comrades in the art world will unite and carry out large-scale movements to save the entire art world, but at the same time, I also want to do my best to save or improve a small part of the art world. I believe that the reason why a group is not good is entirely due to the inferiority of its members. When I do not have the power to improve the group, I will always keep my own members from becoming inferior. I am studying Chinese landscape painting. I want to base myself on my ideals, while traveling the mountains, and while painting, to create a painting method within a few years to eliminate the habitual imitation that has been going on for hundreds of years and inject a dose of stimulant into the dying landscape painting, so that it has a little vitality to revive. At the same time, I also want to re-evaluate the painting theories of past dynasties from the perspective of modern criticism and make strict distinctions to avoid spreading false doctrines again. I want to do these two things to the best of my ability. Everyone must start with the field they are studying, make thorough reforms, and take responsibility. Then, the improvement of the entire group and even the establishment of a new style can be achieved.</p>
<p>Now, in the capacity of a member, I sincerely pray that all comrades will strive to achieve their highest goals! And I deeply hope for the development of the Chinese Art Association!</p>
<h3>My Wish to Join the Art Association</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>The establishment of the Chinese Art Association will surely form a great driving force for the future of art in our country. Art, from whatever perspective, is the highest expression of the national spirit and, moreover, the vitality of the nation. Therefore, the driving force for promoting progress, this group will undoubtedly be the horn of the new era.</p>
<p>I was not originally a person who studied art. In my childhood, drawing was not yet listed as a major subject. My family environment did not allow me to approach music even slightly. Sculpture and architecture were only slightly touched upon much later. My joining the Art Association means that I cannot do any work. I can neither hold a paintbrush nor a carving knife; I am just a complete layman.</p>
<p>But a long time ago, I had a feeling that almost everything we have on the path of art is borrowed. Not only is the introduction and imitation of Western art borrowed, but also the aspect of reviving the past is also borrowed. When quoting everything from ancient times, we often forget the meaning of the era and only preserve the appearance of the ancients. We should create something of our own in our own country, in our own era.</p>
<p>This is by no means empty talk. Only what is rooted in our own land can last for a long time and can also generate the power to promote progress. This certainly requires the efforts of the creators, but it also requires another group of people to clear the way.</p>
<p>How to establish an aesthetic rooted in our own land? How to establish art criticism needed by the times? How to clear the way for new art that is truly born in this era and also needed by this era? I am willing to pick up a chip in this great work and be a small worker in it.</p>
<p>This is my wish to join the Art Association. I hope to be able to make a little progress in this great group.</p>

<h3>On Birth Control</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hao</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanger is here again. This is the second time. This matter has unexpectedly stirred up a small wave in the minds of Easterners, just like the first time she came. Up to today, people's opinions on Mrs. Sanger's actions are still divided: When she arrived in Hong Kong, it is said that an old pastor said that her advocacy of birth control was a degeneration of American sexual morality; it is also said that a certain country planned not to allow Mrs. Sanger to land; Mrs. Sanger's being unwelcome to militarists is naturally to be expected.</p>
<p>At present, the fate of the entire planet is in the hands of imperialists. Imperialists must fight each other to determine who is superior. When humanity is preparing for a great massacre, the promotion of birth control has naturally become "reactionary." They are promoting childbirth, unlimited childbirth, rewarding the production of sacrifices for the god of war!</p>
<p>But there are still many people besides the murderers who welcome this person with a firm belief in saving the world with a warm heart.</p>
<p>The facts are there:</p>
<p>Humanity ultimately needs to progress, and human wisdom also needs to be improved day by day. We cannot be like stupid pigs, just filling ourselves with food in the world. We must engage in creation for the world and engage in construction for humanity. Therefore, we also put forward the slogan of "education."</p>
<p>A person should regard raising children as the most sacred duty of mankind. Since no one can abandon this sacred duty, then how to fulfill this duty becomes an important question. If we still raise children like small animals, considering it fulfilling our duty, then discussing birth control will become superfluous. However, since Ellen Key, children have been discovered in the human community, and it has become a matter of course that children must have appropriate education. Parents who abandon this duty will not only become the enemies of their children, but also the destroyers of humanity.</p>
<p>We have seen so many unfortunate young couples who, due to uncontrolled childbirth, have made their lives precarious. They are unable to raise a large group of children, but they still do not realize the mistake of not practicing birth control.</p>
<p>Among the major social problems, such as the increase in mortality rate, if we do not obliterate the facts, everyone will admit that a part of it is due to the evils caused by unhealthy children being produced in an uncontrolled manner. Children wandering the streets are everywhere, and all kinds of pitiful and tragic phenomena are not due to the "lack of education" planted by their parents? As for the problems of poverty and child labor, although they do not originate entirely from this, if we study them in detail, they are all more or less related to this.</p>
<p>Apart from the second generation of children, let us infer to the parents themselves. They live in the world, are they not just family cattle and horses, the slaves of their children? They should contribute a portion of their best vitality to the human community and society, so that the human community and society can accumulate the contributions of many people into a rich inheritance, leaving it to history. In this way, a person's existence will not lose its meaning. But if a large group of children are hanging on their arms and legs, depriving their parents of the opportunity to breathe, then the parents' lives, besides scrambling for the necessities of life for their children and for themselves, will have no energy to consider other things. Living busily and dying busily, these are all great losses to humanity.</p>

<h3>The Function of Social Science</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>Human survival is inseparable from the supply of material resources. To achieve the purpose of one's own survival, one must engage in labor. But what is the object of labor? This is all the products of nature. Humans use various labor methods to change the products of nature to suit their own living needs, or use them to resist various infringements of nature on humans, in order to achieve the purpose of continuous life.</p>
<p>But individual power is limited, and the scope of nature is very broad. To achieve the purpose of obtaining living materials from nature or resisting the infringements of nature, it is necessary to combine individual power and fight against nature in a collective way. This forms human society centered on labor. From the study of the evolutionary history of human society, we can understand this relationship: the closer the combination of human labor, the more advanced his labor methods and labor tools, and therefore, the richer the results he obtains from nature. Humans use this to improve their lives and obtain greater enjoyment.</p>
<p>From this point of view, an individual cannot survive alone without society. He must participate in certain social relations and production relations, as a cell of a group, to jointly maintain the continuity of life. Some people may think that one can survive on a deserted island like Robinson, but this is fundamentally a legendary fantasy. Even if one can survive temporarily, one will eventually be destroyed.</p>
<p>Since humans cannot survive alone without society, they must thoroughly understand the society on which they depend for survival. In this way, he can understand his position, the historical mission he bears, and decide on his attitude towards the social system. For example, in the current declining capitalist society, due to human oppression and exploitation, the majority of mankind is trapped in poverty and starvation, unable to enjoy the results of their own labor. How to change such a social system and what attitude to take is something that everyone should study and understand. But how to understand it? This can only be done by studying social science.</p>
<p>The phenomena of human society are very complex. Especially in modern capitalist society, due to the progress of material resources and the complexity of production organization, various phenomena of all kinds are formed. To understand these phenomena, one must rely on science.</p>
<p>Science is to find the laws of cause and effect from many chaotic and complex phenomena. Because no matter how chaotic and complex the phenomena are in nature or human society, there is always a kind of interdependence and necessity between them. Based on this relationship, we can systematically understand the occurrence, growth, and inevitable results of many phenomena. For example, because it snows heavily, the weather becomes very cold. There is a causal relationship between the two phenomena of snowfall and cold weather. Another example: because of the anarchy of capitalist production, economic panic occurs. Driven by panic, capitalists actively plunder the market, thus causing imperialist wars. There is a kind of necessity between these phenomena. Social science is to use this scientific method to find out the causal relationship and necessity from the chaotic and complex social phenomena.</p>
<p>However, in the field of science, because the objects of study are different, its classification is also different. It can probably be divided into two types: natural science and social science. Human</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Society is originally one of the natural phenomena, so the reason for separating social science is due to the following characteristics of social science:</p>
<p>First, all social phenomena are conscious, while natural phenomena are unconscious. For example, humans feel dissatisfied with a certain social system and rise up to reform it, because this objective fact is reflected in human consciousness, causing an action. Therefore, social phenomena must go through human consciousness to occur.</p>
<p>Second, all social phenomena are purposeful, while natural phenomena are aimless. For example, the spider webs and beehives built by spiders and bees may be more exquisite than the weavers and carpenters of humans. But the reason why humans are different from these animals is that they already have a certain design in their minds before starting to work and work according to the predetermined purpose. Therefore, the result finally expressed in the labor process already exists in the mind of the laborer when the labor begins.</p>
<p>Third, the form of labor in social phenomena and the form of labor in natural phenomena are completely different. In natural phenomena, most of them have no labor performance. Even if there is, it is different from human labor. For example, animals also take fruits or kill other animals as their own living materials, but they can only use their own natural forces, such as claws and teeth. However, human labor not only uses its own natural forces, but also uses the labor tools it manufactures. Therefore, Franklin once defined mankind as: mankind is an animal that makes tools.</p>
<p>The points mentioned above are the characteristics of social phenomena that are different from natural phenomena. Social science is based on these characteristics to independently constitute a kind of science.</p>
<p>All phenomena in the universe are changing and flowing. That is, everything is a process of happening, growing, and transforming. Social phenomena are of course no exception. Since the primitive communist society of mankind, through the slave society, feudal society, to the modern capitalist society, all have changed based on this principle. Social science is to take this phenomenon as the object and study and explore it to find the law of cause and effect.</p>
<p>What foundation does mankind use to form his society? Why are the economic and government systems of each era different? Why does society have to constantly change? These are all important questions that social science wants to explore. Although one era is different from another era, and social phenomena are so complex, the necessary relationship between them can be found according to the law of cause and effect. For example, in capitalist society, due to the invention of machines and the improvement of labor division, the development of productivity is promoted, and the modern factory system is established, thus forming the capitalist production relationship. According to this production relationship, the democratic politics of citizens are established. However, under this production relationship, mankind is divided into two major camps: citizens and laborers. Laborers work all day long but cannot get enough food and clothing, while citizens only own the means of production and enjoy the products of laborers. Therefore, human exploitation, oppression, unemployment, hunger, panic, war, etc. arise, causing social unrest.</p>
<p>The occurrence of all these phenomena is the inevitability of its history. We understand this relationship, and we can know that due to the conflict between productivity and production relations, society has to change. This is the mission of social science, the truth it exposes. Based on this understanding of the truth, mankind can rise up to seek social reform and the improvement of its own lives.</p>
<p>Due to the above, we can know the purpose and importance of studying social science. However, in the process of research, there are a few points that we cannot but pay attention to:</p>
<p>First, is the practicality of social science. If you study science and abandon practice, it will become useless, let alone social science, which is closely related to mankind.</p>
<p>Second, all phenomena are flowing and changing, and must be understood from its dynamic relationship to obtain a correct understanding.</p>
<p>Third, truth is relative, not absolute. It must be understood from the contradictory development process of phenomena, so as not to mislead people. If you only see the trees but not the forest, you cannot get a correct understanding.</p>
<p>In short, social science is a sharp tool for understanding social phenomena. In the current era of economic panic, armed plunder, and intensifying war crisis, there are often many phenomena that are difficult to understand, which further increases our urgency for research.</p>

<h3>The Land of Wind and Snow</h3>
<p>— Yuan Bo Chen</p>
<p>Kamchatka Correspondence, Soviet Union</p>
<p>Kamchatka is an administrative region of Soviet Siberia. Its southern part is the Kamchatka Peninsula, and its northern part includes the vast area from the Gydan Peninsula to the Taygonos Peninsula; the area is about 1.1 million square kilometers (kilometers), and the coastline is 16,000 kilometers long. There are many mountains on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the south. Most of these mountains are volcanoes, including seventeen active volcanoes that are currently smoking, and the misty phenomenon can be seen from a very far distance; in addition, there are fifty-seven extinct volcanoes that have not shown any activity. Because there are so many volcanoes, hot springs spring up almost everywhere here; even in winter, residents can be seen bathing in the hot springs; if this were in the temperate zone, it would become a large hot spring resort.</p>
<p>The west coast of the peninsula has few harbors, but the east coast has many good harbors; such as the Avachinskaya Bay in the central city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, which controls Kamchatka, has the best harbor conditions.</p>
<p>The entire Kamchatka administrative region is located south of the Arctic Ocean and north of the Kuril Islands, and the climate naturally belongs to the frigid zone. There is a lot of rainfall, and snowflakes are almost constantly flying in the air, so Kamchatka is also known as the Land of Wind and Snow. However, in reality, there are still seasonal changes here. Roughly from October to April can be said to be winter. At this time, it snows heavily almost every day, and there is a terrifying northwest wind. The severity of the cold is unimaginable to those who live in the temperate zone; however, once summer arrives, the air and the residents all become lively, and this is Kamchatka's so-called fishing season.</p>
<p>When the fishing season is approaching, the number of people coming here to fish from other places can be said to be endless, so there are particularly many people here in summer. However, only a small number of indigenous people live here permanently; the number of each of these indigenous groups is as follows:</p>
<p>Koryaks Approximately 12,000</p>
<p>Ghilyaks Approximately 8,000</p>
<p>Itelmens Approximately 1,000</p>
<p>Eskimos Approximately 1,500</p>
<p>Alyutors Approximately 300</p>
<p>Kereks Approximately 500</p>
<p>Tungus Approximately 2,000</p>
<p>Lamuts Approximately 1,500</p>
<p>Kamchadals Approximately 4,500</p>
<p>Among these indigenous people, the Kamchadals and Eskimos mainly eat fish, while the other indigenous people eat reindeer and marine animals, and mostly live a nomadic life.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it seems that Kamchatka must be a very desolate, bitterly cold, and barbarous land. However, the Soviet Union does not despise such a place; under the slogan of "Industrializing Kamchatka," they are working hard to develop its resources; and they have specially established a Kamchatka Joint-Stock Company (established on January 1, 1934), pooling a capital of 52 million rubles, specifically to organize the entire industry here, including fishing, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, coal mining, and transportation.</p>
<p>The forest area here is about 220,000 square kilometers, and three factories for making timber have been established outside Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. In addition, oil and coal are now being actively investigated and developed, and the future is genuinely unpredictable.</p>
<p>The Soviet authorities are now working hard to immigrate people to Kamchatka. Therefore, with the increase in population, the food problem will naturally arise; but they have already paid attention to this problem. They are also working hard to cultivate vegetables, grains, etc. among the immigrants; according to their plan, probably by the end of 1937, the vegetables, grains, dairy products, etc. here will all be self-sufficient. The achievements that this plan has shown can be seen from the following facts——</p>
<p>Last year, Kamchatka already had:</p>
<p>Collective farm households 78.5%</p>
<p>Tractors 20</p>
<p>State-owned farms 772 hectares</p>
<p>Collective farms 664 hectares</p>
<p>Individual farms 109 hectares</p>
<p>Total sown area 2,000 hectares</p>
<p>Kamchatka's most important industry goes without saying is fishing; on the west coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, the period from May to October is the peak season for fishing. In order to obtain food for their families and livestock, the coastal residents must work hard to catch fish at this time, and at the same time, the government is scientifically and on a large scale engaged in fishing. The above-mentioned Kamchatka Joint-Stock Company bears a great responsibility in this matter.</p>
<p>As far as we know, there are already sixteen fish canning factories here; and　　　　　　　　　　　　　factories and ship repair factories. In addition to the fishing workers, the fishermen who actually engage in fishing numbered 3,000 in 1928, but increased to 16,000 in 1934. From this alone, it can be seen the speed of the Soviet Union's fishing development in Kamchatka.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union's fishing development in Kamchatka, we can also use the following two facts to illustrate——</p>
<p>1. State-owned fishing catches (unit: 1,000 quintals):</p>
<p>1928 1934</p>
<p>Salmon, Chum salmon 199.4 669.6</p>
<p>Herring —— 63.0</p>
<p>Cod 9.9 61.2</p>
<p>Crab 20.4 14.3</p>
<p>Other —— 46.5</p>
<p>Total 229.7 840.3</p>
<p>2. State-owned fish products (unit: 1,000 tons):</p>
<p>1928 1934</p>
<p>Salmon, Chum salmon canned 173.5 335.4</p>
<p>Crab canned 13.8 7.5</p>
<p>Salmon, Chum salmon salted 63.9 230.0</p>
<p>As for Kamchatka's entire economy, under the current situation where the slogan of "industrialization" has not been fully realized, the main economic state is still fishing and animal husbandry, and general social life is of course a life in this state. The general situation of fishing has been introduced above, and now we will briefly talk about the animal husbandry situation here.</p>
<p>Due to the relationship between the climate and soil, ordinary cattle, horses, and pigs are not easy to live in Kamchatka, so the main animal husbandry here is reindeer and dogs. In the wilderness and in general places, large and small herds of reindeer can be seen moving around, and no one can count how many there are. As for dogs, they are even more important here. Everything from transporting goods, hunting, and even traveling cannot be done without them; the duties of cattle and horses in other places can be said to be entirely replaced by dogs here. Therefore, the people of Kamchatka attach great importance to dogs, and every household raises many dogs to meet their own living needs. As far as we know, there were about 20,000 dogs here in 1910, about 50,000 in 1926, and about 70,000 in 1931. Judging from this number alone, it can also be seen that there are actually more dogs here than indigenous people.</p>

<h3>Jade Mine Workers</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiao</p>
<p>Tengchong Correspondence, Yunnan</p>
<p>Jadeite jade is considered to be the most popular type of ornament among modern people; its value is quite as expensive as the diamonds that are generally regarded as treasures. Since the display of "Jadeite Three Wonders" produced by pen merchant Zhang Wendi at the Chicago Exposition in the United States, the reputation of Chinese jadeite has soared, and it has gradually attracted the attention of the world. However, although jadeite jade is a decorative treasure and a rare item that everyone desires, I am afraid that very few people can clearly know its place of origin and the situation of its mining.</p>
<p>The jade stone factory is located in the northern section of the "undetermined border" between Yunnan and Myanmar, south of Hukong and west of Mongong, approximately between 25 and 26 degrees north latitude; in the upper reaches of the Uru River, the area where jade is produced is approximately hundreds of stages vertically and horizontally. This area was originally under the jurisdiction of Ganxi and Laisai, two headmen of the Mengyang chieftain—also known as Zuoba, all of whom were Pu Man savages—after the British annexed Myanmar, their forces invaded Mongong and other places, and the two headmen led their people to surrender, but the British still allowed them to govern their original places. The jade stone factories here include Dongmo, Gedi Mo, Mameng, Pagan, and Massa factories; the one managed by Ganxi headman (　　　Xiao Ming) is　　　Ka (also known as Huiyong) factory, the one managed by Laisai headman is Dongmo factory, and the rest are called old factories, and their mining methods vary depending on the environment.</p>
<p>The so-called old factory has a mining history of hundreds of years; whether it is Chinese, Burmese, savage, or Dai people, they can mine at will by the mountain or puddle, with no restrictions on mining rights whatsoever. The mining method is as follows: first, determine a place that no one has dug before, insert a small tree branch or bamboo stick as a marker, and then burn incense, candles, paper money, and sacrifices to pray for the blessings of the gods and to obtain jade stone early. After the sacrifice is completed, the work begins. The number of workers when digging varies, with two or three people or four or five people digging a hole together, and six or seven people to more than ten people digging a hole together; the depth of the digging also has no fixed standard, some dig to two or three feet and the jade layer appears, and some dig to two or three zhang and the stone layer appears. Holes with thick and dense stone layers have a greater chance of success, commonly called "good holes." However, there are also those who obtain jade stone from thin stone layers, and even those who obtain jade stone by digging through grass and mud, commonly called "grass skin mines"; and it is also common to spill blood and sweat and spend four or five months without gaining anything. Those who spend a longer time and gain nothing are mostly riverbank mines; to dig this type of mine, water must be drawn with bamboo tubes while digging, which takes a lot of time. If the bottom layer is turned over and mud is found, then all the work is in vain and there is no hope.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Mining capital can be divided into two types: self-mining and labor-capital joint mining. Self-mining only requires preparing a small amount of food expenses, and the jade obtained belongs to the individual. As for labor-capital joint mining, one person invests and hires workers to dig, providing ten rupees (Indian currency) for food. The jade obtained is divided equally, and if there is no gain at all, the boss pays for the food in vain, and the workers also put in effort in vain. After the jade stone is mined, a 10% tax must be paid, which is also shared equally by the labor and capital; the tax revenue on jade stone for Ganxi and Laisai headmen is not small each year. Those who mine jade stone, in addition to paying a 10% "land tax," must also pay 33% to the Mongong tax post of the British government, called the national tax.</p>
<p>In the old factory areas, miners come one after another at the end of each autumn, with a number of nearly 20,000. From March to April of the following year, jade stone merchants also come one after another, competing to buy. After about another month, merchants and workers all leave the factory one after another, but there are also thousands of workers who have not mined jade stone, have no way to escape poverty, and spend the summer on the factory grounds, which is called "fighting the rain." Summer jade mining mostly uses rainwater to flush: the method is to open up small ditches at higher places on the hillside, introduce rainwater into the ditches, and lead it to a slightly higher place next to the cave, where water pools are excavated for storage. Then, the cave soil is loosened and flushed down with water. In this way, the loose soil in the ditch is washed away by the water, and the digging and flushing are repeated until the mud in the cave is flushed　　　to the stone layer. This method saves a lot of manpower for carrying soil, but it cannot be implemented in dry winters when there is no water, and the factory grounds　　　　　poisonous air is quite prevalent, and those who spend the summer here often die of illness, so they are simply trading their lives for real objects.</p>
<p>Dongmo　　　is called the new factory, and mining has been going on for decades: jade miners must first purchase land from the landlord Ganxi headman, and the land price is quite expensive, ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of yuan per two square zhang. After the land is purchased, they enter through the main tunnel and grope secretly in the direction of the purchase. The jade stone in this type of factory is about fourteen or five zhang deep below the ground, with a layer of jade stone sandwiched in the green stone. Jade miners must　　　the green stone, and then they can obtain the jade stone, so the work is more difficult than in the old factory. The methods of chiseling stone include using steam engines to knock and using charcoal fire to burn. After the stone is broken, it is carried up manually. The workers entering the factory all hold a lamp in their hands and walk forward hunched over, rotating every eight hours, non-stop all night, and their lives are extremely miserable. The location of each household's purchased land depends entirely on luck (jade merchants all have this kind of superstition). Some produce good jade, and some produce little jade, and there is no certain standard; the jade stone obtained must still be submitted to the Mengong for payment of the upper post tax, but there is no need to pay the land tax again. During summer jade mining, the cave is often flooded with water, and in winter, machines are used to drain the water; the mining period each year is only in spring. There are about five or six hundred coolies working during the mining period, and the work is extremely tense and rapid, fearing that delay will ruin all the work. The jade stone produced in the new factory is often more delicate in color than that produced in the various holes of the old factory, commonly known as Xinshan jade.</p>
<p>The Mongong tax post collects taxes according to two standards: jade stone and amber: jade stone is taxed at 33%, and amber is taxed at 5%. In the past ten years or so, the tax amount was contracted by Yunnan　　　　　giant merchants, who contracted it once every three years. In　　　the amount recognized each year was only tens of thousands of rupees, so there was always a　　　　　　　surplus each year. Since October 1929, because most Chinese businessmen disregarded the overall situation and competed in groups, the British government raised the tax rate, requiring an annual payment of 192,000 yuan, a sudden increase of several times compared to the past. According to the amount of post tax collected recently, the value of the jade stone produced each year is approximately more than one million yuan. However, the British here specially loosened the ban on opium and gambling. Opium dens and gambling stalls are set up in almost all the new and old factories; there are various types of gambling, and the gambling donation is also contracted, which can collect approximately 7,000 rupees per year; opium dens do not collect donations, but the price is extremely expensive. About 60% of those who go to the factory to mine jade are Chinese, and 40% are Burmese and savages. Once they get a job, opium dens and gambling stalls are regarded as paradises, and they are unwilling to leave for a moment. Therefore, there are those who have been mining jade for half their lives, but still live in a miserable state of wearing rags and not having enough to eat. We only need to stand on the bank of the Uru River and look up, and we can see many deserted graves, and these deserted graves are the final resting place of these jade miners.</p>

<h3>The Current Status of Major Religions in the World</h3>
<p>— Shi Hua</p>
<p>Religion has a very close relationship with human life. It not only has the power to control human superficial behavior but also to control people's minds. In the past when politics and religion were united, the country's political education was almost under the control of religion. For example, Islam in Arab and Turkish countries, and Christianity in Europe, had supreme authority in the past. Even now, although the authority of religion in politics is not as great as it was in the past, its power and function are still not small in general, and in some places, the controlling power of religion and politics is still very strong (such as Lamaism in Tibet). Because religion has such a significant relationship with human life, all those who pay attention to social issues have to pay special attention to it. Here, what we want to say is the current status of the major religions in the world today, in order to help us understand human religious life and the relationship between religion and all social issues.</p>
<p>The first thing to talk about is the Catholic Church, that is, Catholicism. It is said that the total number of followers of the Roman Catholic Church is now more than 350 million, accounting for 19% of the world's total population; in other words, 19% of all human minds are now controlled by the doctrines of the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In terms of countries, Italy, France, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal in Southern Europe, Poland and Austria in Central Europe, and the countries of Central and South America are the main countries that believe in Catholicism; in addition, more than one-third of the people in Germany are followers of the Catholic Church; and more than half of the people in the Netherlands believe in the Catholic Church; other countries in the world, except for the Soviet Union, almost every country has followers of this religion. Its power and the depth of its relationship with human life can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church, which has so many followers and includes so many ethnic groups, has a total of fourteen archdioceses, more than one thousand three hundred dioceses, and　　　dioceses; below this, there are countless small dioceses, which are under the jurisdiction of the diocese. The central organization of the church is the Papal Court, which has twelve　　　　　　　　　　　and three church tribunals; the entire church is governed by the same church law. Among the current religions, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam can all be said to be world religions, but only Catholicism transcends national boundaries, is controlled by a strict organization, and believes in the same dogma and performs the same rituals.</p>
<p>The power of such a large church organization is undeniably great in the current world, which is fraught with crises. But this effect is not super-people, super-national, or super-crowd, but it is playing a major role under these, although its organization is unified and transcends national boundaries. Here we can first cite the Catholic Church in Italy. The Italian Constitution clearly stipulates that Catholicism is the state religion, and almost all Italians are followers of the Catholic Church. After Mussolini came to power, it is said that in order to respect Italian spiritual culture, he specially protected the Church and revived the Catholic religious education in primary and secondary schools that had been abolished for many years. At the same time, the Church also supported the Black Shirt Prime Minister's unification policy, prohibiting people in important positions in the Church from participating in political activities and dissolving the Catholic Party. Recently, when Mussolini launched an expedition to East Africa, the Roman Pope initially hoped that the incident could be resolved peacefully, but later he also supported the Black Shirt Prime Minister's "spreading civilization" behavior. Judging from these facts, the role played by the Catholic Church in Italy is very clear, and there is really no need for further explanation. Secondly, we can also talk about the Catholic Church in Germany. Before Hitler gained power, when the struggle between the two extremes was sharp in Germany, many of the followers of the German Catholic Church resonated with Hitler. However, after Hitler came to power, he wanted to use the program of the National Socialist Party to control the Church, to prohibit freedom of speech, and even Church groups were not allowed to have any social activities. At the same time, because Germany's economic crisis was deepening day by day, the government had to implement extreme foreign exchange management, and even prohibited a　　　　　from taking more than ten marks out of the country, which of course greatly hindered the German Catholic Church's dispatch of missionaries abroad and the lives of German missionaries already abroad. In the past, there was a female monastery abbot who was arrested for sending money to female teachers abroad and sentenced to eight years in prison. In addition, there are many similar things that cannot be listed in detail here. However, this of course made the conflict between the Catholic Church and the Hitler government in Germany very sharp. The outcome is still impossible to judge specifically, but by looking at the relationship between the Catholic Church in Italy and Mussolini, as well as the past performance of the German Catholic Church, it is also possible to know the role it is playing and will play now and in the future. As for the Catholic Church in other countries, there may be some differences in certain manifestations, but its essence is the same.</p>
<p>The second is Judaism. Needless to say, those who believe in this religion are mainly Jews. According to rough statistics, the current distribution of Jews in the world is as follows: (unit: 1,000 people)</p>
<p>The above is the number of Jews in the major countries: putting together all the Jews in the world, there are 15.6 million people, accounting for about 1% of the world's population. These　　　Jews have their own religion, but they do not have their own country; although there was a movement to rebuild the Jewish state in the past, it was never established. Now they are being bullied and despised everywhere, and even do not have the right to live in Germany. This matter fully teaches us: if a nation does not have its own country, then even if it still preserves its own religion and its own spiritual culture, it is of no use.</p>
<p>The third is Islam. There was a time in history when Islam was very strong; even now, it still has a force that cannot be underestimated. In the Iranian Plateau, Asia Minor, Arabia, and our Xinjiang and Gansu areas, there are vast　　　followers; in addition, it is also very prevalent in Egypt, Morocco, and other places. According to statistics, there are currently　〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇人.　1.09 billion Muslims in the world.</p>
<p>Buddhism and Christianity are both transnational, and Islam is the same as them in this respect. In fact, Islam is a combination of politics and religion, and the sacrifice and administration are consistent. When worshiping gods, there is only a difference between believers and non-believers, and there is no difference between races and ethnic groups. However, when there is a dispute between ethnic groups, the followers of Islam also love their country quite a lot. In this respect, patriotic enthusiasm can and should be above religious belief.</p>
<p>The fourth is Lamaism. This religion can be said to be Buddhism unique to Tibet. The so-called "Lama" is actually the Tibetan word for superior and unsurpassed. Its origin is very ancient, and it originated about a thousand years ago. Later, it underwent several changes, and among these changes, the religious reform of Tsongkhapa to create the Yellow Sect was the most famous; now Tsongkhapa's name in Lamaism is as solemn as the founder of Buddhism. Originally, the Red Sect had absolute power in Tibet, but after Tsongkhapa advocated religious reform to create the Yellow Sect, the Red Sect gradually lost power. Now Tibet and Mongolia have become the center of Lamaism, but in Lamaism here, the power of the Yellow Sect accounts for about 70%, the Red Sect accounts for only 20%, and there is also the Black Sect. As for the depth of the Tibetan and Mongolian people's belief in Lamaism, that goes without saying. Because this religion has such a deep relationship with the lives of Tibetans and Mongolians, when dealing with the Tibetan and Mongolian issues, we must understand and pay attention to the beliefs of the people there and to Lamaism.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned religions, there are of course many religions in the world. However, due to space constraints, I can only be brief. Now, in order to give everyone a general understanding of the religions of the world, I have specially listed the number of followers of the major religions in the world as follows: (unit: 1,000 people)</p>
<p>Christianity 682,400</p>
<p>Catholicism 331,500</p>
<p>Greek　Church 144,000</p>
<p>Church 206,020</p>
<p>Islam 209,020</p>
<p>Hinduism 230,150</p>
<p>Buddhism 150,180</p>
<p>Judaism 15,630</p>
<p>Other 50,870</p>

<h3>Scenic Spots of Nanchang</h3>
<p>— Yang Zhu</p>
<p>Speaking of Nanchang, many people will associate it with Wang Bo's "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng," saying "the falling rosy clouds fly in unison with the solitary wild ducks; the autumn water shares one color with the long sky." It seems that even Jiangnan does not have such beautiful scenery. However, when you ask the people of Nanchang, none of them do not smile silently. In reality, the so-called Pavilion of Prince Teng is merely a scenic spot that "gains fame through literature" and bears a false reputation. What the locals see is basically the same as what outsiders see, which is nothing more than a stone-carved "preface," and nothing else! Literature deceives people, nothing could be worse, it is a hundred times more absurd than the "Ten Scenes of West Lake."</p>
<p>However, there are several scenic spots in Nanchang that are worth describing:</p>
<p>Hundred Flowers Islet　Located in the center of Nanchang city, surrounded by East Lake on all sides, with winding bridges and flowing water, shaded by green willows, it is extremely "clear and elegant with water and trees." The "Crowned鳌 Pavilion" stands in the middle, offering a panoramic view of the entire lake. On summer nights, boating in the heart of the lake, the fragrance of lotus is better than that of West Lake. And the figures with bamboo hats by the shore under the setting sun, viewed from the "Crowned鳌 Pavilion," particularly evoke the feeling of "being in a painting."</p>
<p>Three Villages　Located east of Liaozhou outside Nanchang city, peach blossoms are extremely abundant. The three villages are: Front Village, Middle Village, and Back Village. When the peach blossoms are in full bloom in spring, the three villages are covered with peach orchards, and most of the villagers make a living by growing peaches. However, the peaches produced are not good, with a澀and unsweet taste, there should be a "great difference" compared to the Longhua peaches. As for the number of peach orchards, it is actually several times that of "Longhua," but unfortunately, it is not located in a bustling metropolis, which inevitably disappoints the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>Ruzi Pavilion　It commemorates Xu Ruzi, who "lowered the bed for Chen Fan." The environment is quiet and secluded, most suitable for leisurely sitting and enjoying tea under the shade of green willows. It is a place worth lingering in.</p>
<p>Tantai Tomb　The ancient Tantai Tomb is located outside Tantai Gate. It is said to be the tomb of Tantai Mieming. There are many ancient steles on the tomb. Although the architecture is not very magnificent, one can still see a bit of the architectural style of ancient tomb passages. The surrounding scenery, because it is outside the city, is full of rustic charm.</p>
<p>Qingyun Temple　It is an ancient temple, famous for its osmanthus flowers. Not only are there many osmanthus flowers, but there are also many rare varieties. There is an ancient osmanthus tree, so large that it can be embraced, formed by five trees growing together. It is said to be several hundred years old, yet it is still very lush. Every autumn, its fragrance spreads for several miles.</p>

<h3>A Type of Sound that Entices Fish</h3>
<p>Whether fish have a sense of smell and hearing is a question that has already been answered with common sense judgments and verifiable experimental reports, so we don't need to say more. What remains to be studied is what kind of sounds fish actually like to hear, that is, what kind of appropriate sounds people should use to attract fish. This is a rather interesting question.</p>
<p>In the world today, it goes without saying that Norway is the most prosperous in the fishing industry. Therefore, research on fish and all aquatic products is also particularly advanced in Norway. Now, there is a member of a fisheries research institute here, named 格爾加托 (Gěrjiātúo), who is very enthusiastic about researching sounds that entice fish. His research process and results, needless to say, are very relevant to the world's fishing industry and to science.</p>
<p>For fish in a pond, it is not difficult to startle them with a sound.</p>
