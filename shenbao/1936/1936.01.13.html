<h3>國際形勢轉變之關鍵</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>自歐戰吿終而國際聯盟成立國際間所謂軍事同盟之形成似爲各國所當引以爲戒者然究之事實殊不盡然如洛迦諾公的成立後法國與波蘭捷克所締結者軍事同盟也而各小協的國相互關係之發展亦軍事同盟之性質也及德國希特勒上台法國縱橫捭闔之外交政策雖未形成所謂軍事同盟然其所造成之國際集團在一旦有事時固不失爲軍事同盟之骨幹至最近英法兩國參謀部所締結之軍事合作辦法則更顯具軍事同盟之精神故軍事同盟之締結事實上將復返於大戰前之舊觀殆毫無疑義矣</p>
<p>此次英法之軍事合作就其初步之意義言當爲對付意大利之對阿侵略與對英威脅同時亦爲防止德國之向外發展與對法威脅故共最直接之目標完全在意德若進一步言直可謂對付遠東日本之一種預備步驟蓋意大利今日對阿之行動無非蹈襲日本侵略中國之故智衡以今日之國際法理二者固皆所謂非法的行動也大戰後之英法二國時多齟齬乃世人目爲不易合作者今旣能捐除宿嫌一致謀抑意大利之野心則他日英法之集團有何不能擴大而爲英美法俄之集團以共同對付國際侵略者乎此我人所可預想者也</p>
<p>英法軍事合作吿成其後果如何雖尙難言然可以推測者不外二途　意大利及早趁風轉舵從事和解　意大利圖謀結合德日另成一種軍事集團和解若能成就歐局似可暫趨安定唯就墨索里尼歷來「一不做二不休」之堅强態度觀之則意德日結合亦非不可能蓋今日德意之間所以不能合作者無非爲中歐問題耳設中歐問題雙方能成立諒解則共他方面意德實聲氣相投且今决之英法軍事合作不僅所以對意亦所以對德是德意結合之外的條件固已具備祇須雙方有意不難成爲事實至就日本而言則日德軍事同盟之傳說在英法俄三方旣皆言之鑿鑿而就事理言其可能性亦極大蓋日本爲减少蘇俄在其側面之威脅計不能不聯一强有力之西方反俄國家以謀策應而此理想之與國殆舍德莫屬同時德國方面則爲擴展其領土計必唯聯日始有向俄侵略之可能也日德如能同盟合作則日意合作允無若何困難祇須墨索里尼有意於聯日日本當不難引爲同調唯就現勢觀察意大利處於英法軍事合作之形勢下稍形軟化共意固猶在和解也但意大利苟因和解之途不通而竟與德日結成聯合陣錢則國際形勢必將大變因而促成英美法俄之大結合當亦意料中事我國對於此種國際形勢之來臨其將採取何種態度乎是實値得我人深切考慮者也</p>

<p>東京　日本政府之回訓、經內閣全體通過、卽由廣田外相電達永野全權代表、該回訓係由四條而成、茲錄於左、</p>
<p>須努力於會議之圓滿進行、以期達到全般協定之成立、　出席十四日召開之第一委員會時、仍須以廢除或縮减航空母艦等類攻擊武器之主張爲中心、將日本之根本主張再行確切闡明、假令量的限制不能成立協定、亦須將日本所提之徹底軍縮方針、使對方各國加以認識、　在十四日之第一委員會、須將日本所提之量質雙方之軍縮案加以說明、倘今後討論之基礎方式、不能容納日本提案而探决通吿案時、不可參加審議、屆時當採取退會形式、僅以傍聽員留席、當無異議、　倘五國間竟無成立本質上之軍縮限制恊定之希望時、仍當預備對於可以成全之問題訂立協定、</p>
<p>日本方面現對於下列各項當卽提倡條的中限制使用潛水艦、　（甲）限制商船之武裝（倫敦條約第十四條）（乙）軍艦處分之條項（倫敦條約第十八條）　建艦自制之五國共同宣言、（十二日同盟社電）</p>
<p>東京　據日方消息、倫敦海軍軍縮會議第一委員會、定於本月十三日再揭幕、擬再提出討論日本之共通最大限軍縮案、但美國代表仍取極强硬之態度、謂對於日本之提案已無再討論之餘地、而其他英法意等國代表亦有拒絕日本提案之意、惟日方因尙未接到本國訓電、故提議延期一日再開、卽定於十四日再開、據東京方面之觀測、日本之提案定爲四對一絕對多數之吾决、海軍軍縮會議將由此陷於破裂云云、聞日代表已决定發表破裂聲明書、將退出軍縮會議云、（十二日華聯社電）英國政府當局擬於軍縮會議之破局以前、期待日本代表之圓滿脫離、正可日美兩國代表間熱心斡旋、其中尤以參事官柯列基氏曾於十日秘密與美國首席全權代表台維斯民會見、慫慂該會應給與日本代表以發言之機會、以便避免糾紛、得以圓滿袂別、一方面柯列基氏對於日本全權代表團則要請派遣傍聽人員、可見會議决裂之最後手續、當因日本政府派遣傍聽人員之關係而發生若千變更、亦未可知也、（十二日同盟社電）</p>
<p>東京　東京各報皆載社論批評倫敦海會之危局、豫料在明日會議中日本之要求經繼續解釋後而卒被拒絕則內閣將命日德代表泳野退出會議、留一觀察員列席將來之四國會議、大阪每日新聞茶注意星期四日會議英日主要代表努力挽回海會破裂之舉、謂海會主席英外相艾登於永野釋明一切後宣稱、渠深悉日本不能讓步之理由、如大會不幸破裂、英國將仍爲日本之摯友、艾登並表示願兩國勿忘前好、繼續合作云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務總理赫爾今日在報界大會宣稱、副國務總理費理浦爲出席倫敦海會美代表之一、定星期四日啟程返國、此舉乃依費氏本意留處倫敦僅數星期、然後回國以海會會議情形報吿政府、故費氏之回國、與海會破裂之形勢毫無關係云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>新嘉坡　據悉海陸空軍專家已草就計劃，如倫敦海軍會議失敗、卽將在香港設防、中國艦隊司令特蘭爾上將、已定於本月十七日首途倫敦、向帝國防務委員會報吿此項計劃、按據華盛頓條的規定、香港爲禁止設防者云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>日回訓案內容　外海兩省恊議之結果</h3>
<p>東京　外務海軍兩省恊議會討論决定對永野全權之重要回訓案、已於十一日午後二時起在外務省歐亞局長室開會、外務方面之東鄉歐亞局長加藤軍縮課長、海軍方面有豐田軍務局長岡軍縮課長等人出席、根據永野全權代表之請訓、討論達四小時、結局認爲縱使除破裂以外另無良策、亦須盡力於根本方針、關於此點、意見巳屬一致、午後七時暫時休會、海軍方面之幹部人員集合於海相官邸綜合其主張、復於十時半再行開會、繼續討論至十二日午前零時半、漸將海軍原案製成、茲錄海軍方案之大致情形於左、　日本政府衷心切望達到網羅參加各國之全部協定、期待共繼續行使圓滿審議、　因此日本所主張之共同最大限度以設立此項方針爲中心而進行議事、以期實現徹底之軍縮、實行不威脅不侵略之事態、故概續努力於會議、希望恢復討論量的限制問題、而導入於正軌、倘截止討論量的問題時、日本亦須依照旣定方針、凡與量的限制毫無關係之其他任何提案、决不關與其審議、　但在貢獻世界和平擁有高尙精神而召集此項會議、倘有崩潰情形、自應努力避免、鑑於今後之一般情勢、務望設法善處、　關於吾人根本主張之量的限制問題、或廢除主力艦航空母艦等等攻擊式之武器尙未得到充分說明之機會、頗不無遺憾、今後仍須努力加以充分之說明、　倘幾經審議而於關係國間仍不能得到諒解時、則他國提議在關係國間認爲有成立可能性之限制使用潛水艦及其他事項成立恊定方案之際、當不惜與之協力、　倘因他國態度關係、無論如何均處於非退會不可之立塲時、仍須應關係國之要請、作爲傍聽資格而出席、似不必拒絕者也云云、</p>
<p>上項回訓案當經十二日臨時閣議之决定、卽由廣田外相將上項回訓發出、俾永野全權代表將以處置破裂情形之一切手續云、（十二日同盟社電）</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫演講蘇聯外交政策</h3>
<p>莫斯科　人民委員會主席莫洛托夫演講蘇聯外交政策，謂「去年蘇聯與其他各國關係、一般而言、正在正常發展、在無數事件中、蘇聯對外關係均向擁護和平方向發展、任何場合、蘇聯均已盡其鞏固世界和平、允以鞏固歐洲及亞洲和平之職責」、（鼓掌）「目下實有詳述蘇聯與各國關係之必要、如與第七次蘇維埃大會比較、尙無本質上之變化、余將略述若干重要事件、蘇聯之外交政策、余等對於鄰邦關係有一顯例可舉、我國西部南部東都邊界全長的達二萬公里、與若干大中小國相接壤、但彼等對於蘇聯之親善態、不能均如土耳其之眞誠、（鼓掌）彼等無一國家在此時期感受蘇聯之侵害、反之即最小國家、彼等政策常受巨大帝國主義列强反蘇聯勢力之脅迫、但彼等對於蘇聯關係、亦無任何理由表示憂慮、然須特述余等之遠東邊境、該處由於日本佔領滿洲造成特殊形勢」</p>
<p>對歐關係</p>
<p>「爲謀保全歐洲和平、蘇聯與法國捷克等國、締結極重要之所謂東歐互助公的、該的據法國建議、除蘇聯·法國及捷克之外、尙須邀德國·波蘭·拉脫維亞·愛沙尼亞·立陶宛等國簽字、但因德國及波蘭先後拒絕、東歐互助公的竟未完成、幸此未能阻止法蘇互助公約之於去年五月簽字、在現任法國總理賴伐爾來莫斯科時、蘇聯及法國之共同願望獲得證實、此願望即為促成包括未簽字各國·包括互不侵略·互相商議·不援助侵略者此等義務之東歐地方公約、此後蘇捷互助公約相繼簽字、蘇聯及捷克代表宣稱、彼等認為蘇法及蘇捷公約、僅為保全東歐和平政策之部份實現、捷克現任總統貝奈斯博士在其關於莫斯科談話之有名報吿中、指出兩國代表現正特別關。於「普遍集體組織之純正實現、以達和平不可分割基礎上之安全保證」、對此政策，蘇聯政府實為後盾、余將復述英國現任外長艾登之來莫斯科、此行意義可於一事見之、此即蘇聯代表與艾登之談話、造成「目下兩國外交政策之任何主要問題、均無利害衝突」、此種結論、因此繼續推進英蘇關係之先决條件、今已存在」、</p>
<p>對美關係</p>
<p>「蘇聯與美國關係正在正常發展、允在商業及經濟方面、同時余等亦不能對於若干美國報紙之屢謀鼓動反蘇聯戰爭默不一言、此等報紙代表傾向法西主義之反動集團、目的在破壞蘇聯與美國之親善政策、此政策對於保全世界和平實有重大意義」、</p>
<p>俄烏斷交</p>
<p>「去年蘇聯與比利時·盧森堡·哥倫比亞三國建立外交關係、但另一方面、烏拉圭政府因受巴西壓迫、（據云且受歐洲若干反動團體壓迫）竟與蘇聯絕交、如有人信烏拉圭之公吿、則將以爲蘇聯之任務、即在干涉巴西及烏拉圭之內政、（譁笑鼓掌）但巴西及烏拉圭之統治者如欲嫁禍於人、則其所知過少、如君已讀貝特尼（蘇聯著名政評家）之「政治流氓」、則對烏拉圭之公吿已無多言必要、因此文已詳釋烏拉圭事件、與烏拉圭乳酪問題間之聯帶關係也、（鼓掌及譁笑）然蘇聯政府即對烏拉圭之行動亦不能輕易放過、因彼對我非特毫無理由、且直接侵犯國聯盟的、而蘇聯與烏拉圭均爲盟國、因此外交委員會已向國聯按訴烏拉圭政府之行動、被並不遵照國聯盟的、先將爭執送交國際仲裁法庭要求調解、遽行斷絕邦交」、</p>
<p>對德關係</p>
<p>「余將復述與德國及日本關係、此因種種理由、特受我國勞動大衆注意、先言德國、余將直言蘇聯政府願與德國建立較良好之關係、自兩國人民之利茶觀之、此固完全有益、但此政策之實現、不能僅恃余國，且在德國政府、現今德國政府之外交政策本質何在、余曾在蘇維埃第七决大會中述其外交政策之主要傾向、引用希特勒之著作「余之奮鬥」、此書在德銷售數百萬份、在此書中、希特勒直言「征取領土政策」之必要、同時希氏直謂「余今所謂歐洲新國、自指俄羅斯勒其邊境各屬國」、自余在蘇維埃大會宣讀希特吸之著作、德國政府並未吾認此等計劉及征取係將十一日在海軍外務聯合協議會决定之回訓案加以說明、各參議官均無異議、槪經承認、午後一時散會、（十二日同盟社電）指蘇聯、反之、在其緘默中完全證明希特勒之上述意見、此固無足驚奇、世人均知國社黨之報紙急於順此方向推進彼等種種準備計劃、雖非僅止於此、此種攫取他國領土之罪惡宣傳、已在德國國外覓得新伴侶、德國資本之種種代言人已在其鄰國波蘭出現、如斯得特尼茨基先生及克拉哥報紙之昏庸紳士、彼等肆口在吠、公然提倡攫奪蘇聯某部領土、而其怪異信徒、亦在屢作此等夢囈、（譁笑鼓掌）余等之鄰國芬蘭亦有若干份子時作類似妄語、以響應最富侵略野心之帝國主義各國、</p>
<p>「世人均知德國法四斯蒂不僅努力於侵略計劃、且擬於最近之將來促其實現、世人均知德國法西黨人已將其控制下之德國化爲兵營、且因其位在中歐、不僅威脅蘇聯、他姑不言、試以捷克爲例、彼不威脅任何鄰國、且正忙於和平建設、但已被德國法西斯蒂之陰雲所覆蔽、但見兵士刺刀機關槍新發明之毒氣及化學戰具、高速度之無聲軍用飛機、使邊界之兵士戰爭、化爲測不及備之屠殺和平民衆以至婦女兒童、凡此均足危害和平、且不限於歐洲、現令德國情形如何矛盾、可於下事見之、即一面推行其反蘇聯外交政策、但其某一部份統治團體接受德國政府建議、於一九三五年九月四日與蘇聯簽訂協定、給與信用貸欵二萬萬馬克期限五年、余等巳順利接受此項貸欵、及去年捷克之二萬五千萬克郎五年信用貸欵、過去數月、德政府之代表並向余等提議另訂更大量之十年貸欽、余等雖不渴求國外貸欵、且已異於往昔、開始用現金向國外大批購買貨物、但亦决不拒絕德政府此種商業提議之討論、發展國外貿易及經濟關係、不受或此或彼政治勢力之左右、此與蘇聯政策相符合、余信此亦符合德國人民之益、此使德國政府見於實行、」</p>
<p>對日關係</p>
<p>「最後詳述對日關係、蘇聯締結出售中東鐵路恊定、藉以表示其和平及退讓、中東鐵路出售協定係於去年三月簽字、該路已移交日「滿」當局、中東路欵支付及向日「滿」購貨、亦已正常進行、關於其他實際問題、直至現在、蘇聯亦常設法謀與日本諒解、然而蘇聯及日本間之主要問題則仍懸而未决、日本直至現在、尙在逃避余等於三年前所提締結蘇日互不侵犯公的、此種行動不能無疑、另一方面、日「滿」軍隊侵犯蘇聯邊境之種種企圖旣未停止、亦不减殺、余將僅述一事、即十二月十日有日「滿」兵士的五十人於諾伏亞萊克賽夷夫卡侵入蘇聯領土逾一二公里、並向我國邊防軍開槍及機關槍、結果邊防兵四人及隊長科台尼科夫陣亡、另有兩人受傷、彼等後受回擊、並受相當損失、亦即退回滿洲境內、但此行動之挑釁性質、則已無待解釋、此爲日本政府代表所行另一事實、此决不能視爲未越正常關係、我國駐日大使優列尼夫提議組織蘇日「滿」邊境委員會、以調查並消滅邊境糾紛將及半載、但直至現在、日本政府對此提議仍未答覆、據云日本軍部中之若干團體需要蘇聯邊境糾紛、藉以轉移世人對於日本侵呑滿洲、以及向華北及整個中國擴張之注意、此種邊境衝突、對於日本某一部份人民亦感需要、藉向世界表示日木政策之「堅定」與「强面」、此事已極明瞭、日軍向余遠東邊境開火仍不終止、而日本軍部亦正侵犯我國邊境、正如彼之侵入他國領土」、</p>
<p>日德同盟</p>
<p>莫氏續謂、「最近據稱日德波蘭三國將訂軍事協定、此層無甚可怪、日德前此乘機退出國聯並非無因、彼欲縱乎侵略耳、自彼等外交政策視之、彼等確爲世界最具侵略性質之强國、德國法西當局對其併呑蘇聯計劃、恒以蘇聯德國並非貼隣爲辭、遮掩世人耳目、唯吾人盡知德國以他國之從恿、在波羅的海正力爭優勢、並與波蘭（彼與蘇聯毘連疆界甚長）保持特種關係、</p>
<p>國防鞏固</p>
<p>「故吾國在東西邊境均須設置必要高度的國防、（鼓掌）數年以來、吾人對此已有極大怖置、唯如吾人考慮防衛吾人之和平勞動工人與集體農民防衛、吾國不使外力侵略得逞、保衛吾人之勝利與偉大社會主義建設、則吾人對於國防設施、猶不能滿足、（鼓掌）吾人必須提供一切必要的物質條件、從事於此、故吾人本年度必須大量擴充國防預算、（鼓掌、其時史丹林行近主席團桌、聽衆熱烈歡呼不止、並起立歡呼、）吾人已有强大之工農紅軍、（鼓掌）吾人必須堅决努力、使吾國各部份軍隊均有忠誠熟練之戰士飛行家砲手化學師坦克車手射擊能手、（鼓掌）吾人已對紅軍指幹人員簽叙等級、分贈稱號、加强紅軍指導幹部之重要、（鼓掌）唯有此種紅軍、乃能忠誠努力、為和平、為蘇聯國防、為社會主義而奮鬥、（鼓掌）吾人必須繼續加强吾國紅軍、同時必須利用一切可能以保全和平、並向舉世勞苦大衆、解釋吾國國際和平政策之原則與特殊路綫、</p>
<p>意阿問題</p>
<p>「吾國加入國聯一舉、並非說明蘇聯對外政策與資本主義各國、在原則上已無根本區別、吾人試舉意阿戰爭爲例、即知其相反、意阿戰爭爲標本的帝國主義使略殖民地戰爭、意大利法西主義爲其佔奪阿國、變阿國爲其殖民地之政策、公開辯護、世界大戰而後、各大帝國主義列強進行殖民地分贓、意大利以爲此項分贓、對彼並不公平、故欲發動新的戰爭、大動干戈、犧牲阿國、以饜其擴充殖民地之欲望、法西意國目前行動、顯係部份再分割世界之先鋒、惟今日之世界正包孕巨大事變、且令歐洲資本家統治者大爲震驚、法西政府復要求其他帝國主義及國聯全體、支持其侵略殖民地行動、各國所有政策之眞相、在其對意阿戰爭關係中、暴露無遺、吾人請言大國、從表面觀之、各大國佔奪殖民地」之政策、在原則上似有不伺、惟實際則不然、參加國聯之各資本主義國家、其態度顯有不同、惟此種不同、决非表明彼等佔奪殖民地政策有何原則上之差異、此種不同之原因、乃在各國對於意國帝國主義力量之增强、其關心有程度上之不同耳、非國聯會員國亦然、資本主義列强之中、絕無一國視弱國之獨立、較其自私自利參加分割殖民地之企圖爲重要者、惟有蘇聯、其於意阿戰爭抱持其獨特之態度、彼在原則上、與任何帝國主義、任何佔奪殖民地政策完全不同、惟有蘇聯能明告世界、彼對國聯會員國阿比西尼亞、遵重平等與獨立之原則、彼於國聯及任何資本主義國家欲破壞其獨立與平等之行動、均不參贊助、蘇聯此項政策與國聯其他會員國在原則上絕然不同、彼有巨大之國際意義、且有重要成果、</p>
<p>「蘇聯在一小國即阿比西尼亞之實例中、已向國聯表示、彼矢忠於各國獨立與各民族權利平等之原則、蘇聯復運用其加入國聯之舉、實現其對帝國主義侵略國之政策、蘇聯加人國聯之第一年、已充分證明吾人决議加入國聯會之正確、國聯究為資本主義國家之組織、彼內部有各種缺點、然國聯在某種程度上、對於戰爭販子與侵略國家已具牽制作用、國聯應受批評、因彼並未盡力設法完成其任務、如於意阿戰爭一端、國聯對於侵略國則表示其歸後之意見、吾人必須承認、國聯並未設法制止戰爭、吾人於此不能忽視、國聯在此事件中、並未爲愛好和平者所統馭、乃爲援助侵略國之國家所支配、在此場合、吾人應提及蘇聯曾參與國聯關於意阿戰爭之决議、特別關於對意（國聯承認爲侵略國）實施經濟制裁之决議、</p>
<p>戰機危迫</p>
<p>意阿戰爭表現、世界戰爭危機日益增强、且日益包羅整個歐洲、戰爭方經開始、吾人無從預吿其將如何停止、於何時停止、雖然、任何人均知意大利法西主義在此事件中、已化大量資本、意大利統治者欲鞏固其力量、以爲唯一大道及在爭取新殖民地、而冒險戰爭、而並非國內經濟與文化之上進、此種事實已不言而喻、今日各資本主義國家在某種程度上、正以極不平衡之步伐、脫離近年來之經濟恐慌、然即在今日、彼等自身並不相信、彼等力量得以國內力量之發展而增强、於此、吾人已能了解帝國主義之重欲征伐殖民地、果何所爲矣、意阿戰爭之深刻原因、亦即在此、日德意三國、彼等或則巳經出動、或則於明日即將出動、發動全世界資本主義國家之新搏鬥、此種行動以及上述三國積極對外政策之設施，世界無一國家將不受其影響、</p>

<h3>英國海軍重建之謎</h3>
<p>世界各强國。鑑於第二决世界大戰之危機。莫不爭先恐後。作軍事上之準備。就中以空軍及機械兵團爲新興之軍備。改進多方。固無論矣。而歷史較久之海。列强亦仍視作疆防之重要設備。因之一面宣傳和平。極合縱連橫之能事。一面勾心鬥角。作磨礪以須之佈置。在大不列顚帝國。本部旣屬島國。殖民地遍天下。素以海軍稱雄。爲應付大局計。允不能不力爭首覇。最近在普選期中。諸部大臣莫不宣示其抱負於國人。其最足驚人者爲悍然不顧一切。决將大部海軍重建。但以事關軍事秘密。建造成本數目若干。外間未能詳悉。只知其的爲一萬萬金磅而已。因之揣測紛耘。舉凡如何重建。隻數若干。噸數若干。何時開始。需費如何分配等等。乃成爲英國海軍重建之謎。</p>
<p>記者西航無事。披閱歐報。閒與英方乘客縱談。始的略知其槪梗。愛略述其要點。爲國人吿。</p>
<p>軍事學專家費拉培（H.C.Ferraby）之言曰。「英國海軍重建。經閣臣昭示天下。已無可諱言。　所謂重建。並非擴大軍備之謂。亦非有意與列强作海力競爭。不外以新艦調換舊艦。而使其對各大海軍國防戰能力比率前後無大差別而已」但舊艦何用。及所謂無甚差別之目的如何達到。則費氏無從懸揣矣。費氏又曰。「總之。吾人之所要求者。爲在一九二一年五强所訂之華盛頓條的。及一九三〇年加以擴充之倫敦條的內活動而已。吾人現探悉在此三數年內需要掉換之軍艦有戰鬥艦十三艘。巡洋艦三六艘。驅逐艦五三艘。潛水艦二八艘。雖下月舉行軍備限制會議時。巡洋艦數目或被裁减。但此節尙屬疑問。可以不管。而在一般海軍在職人員之意見。驅逐艦掉換數目實應加增。蓋超過建造年限之艦數。實爲一一八也。</p>
<p>「吾人試就一九三〇年之倫敦條的推究之。可知英海軍爲適合額定噸數計。勢不能全數掉換。茲僅就上述四類艦數。用軍艦建造之噸値計算法。求共成本總數。則得一五四，五〇六，六〇〇金磅。</p>
<p>「此鉅大之總數中。戰鬥艦之所需的占其半。蓋共噸値（Cost　per　ton）雖小。而其噸數則甚大也。因之英政府在八年前已同意海部之建議。就戰鬥艦之縮小噸數問題。加以研究。俾能得一超越列强之成績。就理論言之。則二五，〇〇〇噸爲最適宜。而一九二一一華盛頓條的所規定之三五，〇〇〇噸。實覺太大。若能依二五〇〇〇噸之新制减細。每一戰鬥艦可省建費二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇金鎊。誠屬合算。然美國爲其本國環境計算。堅持非三五，〇〇〇噸不可，（其實就英國眼光觀察美國。此噸數尙覺太小）其新預算已依此數目進行。則吾人重建海軍。亦將不甘落後。應以此標準噸數爲計値基礎。</p>

<h3>師範敎育之趨勢（下）</h3>
<p>— 中央大學敎育系主任常道直</p>
<p>現代師範敎育之任務不僅爲造就傳授簡易知能的，童子之師，其更重大的任務乃在於養成國民的導師。</p>
<p>小學敎師之活動範團，不限於敎室以內，而且要仲張其勢力於學校，四圍之居境，使小學校成爲地方的文化中心，敎師成爲民衆之領導者。近年德國和蘇聯之新師資敎育制度，就是準據應付此項新需要而規劃的。一九二五年普魯士之敎育當局曾宣稱；此等國民學校師資之訓練目標，非僅以養成敎室內之敎師爲限，而且要造就民衆之敎育者與導師。最近德國國社主義的師範敎育政策上有一重要措施，即將所有師資大學移向鄉區及邊境。所以遷至鄉區者蓋認遠離城市之農村最能保持德意志國粹之純潔性，使師範生對於民族文化有更親切的體騐，且與民衆日常生活實際相接觸，使其對於民衆之敎育上的需要有正確的認識。所以散佈邊疆一帶者，蓋視師資訓練機關，彷彿一種文化的稠堡；一方面爲國防之精神的堡壘，同時並爲發揚本國文化於國外之根據地。此種遠大的師範敎育方針，在人類文化史上的確是一種創舉！</p>
<p>再看社會主義的國家。蘇聯之當局者對於敎師在社會的改造上所佔地位之重要，早有深切的認識。列寗氏嘗聲言：「我們必須提升敎師的地位到他們在布爾喬的社會中，從來未曾達到而且將來亦永不能達到之高度。」一般美庸的敎師所以特被社會主義的國家所重視，便是因爲他們看到一個敎師的工作之影響，决非囿於敎室以內，而且能够及於廣大的民衆。俄國未來的敎育工人，在敎育專科學校所受之訓練不僅爲從事敎室內工作所必須之準備，而且包括領導及參加社會運動種種方術之講習。就我國現狀觀察，小學敎師同時當爲民衆領導者之主張，允含有深切的意義，應常列爲師範學校主要目標之一。</p>
<p>師範敎育之內容爲敎村知識，敎學技能與人格修養三者之粽合，當力保平衡不容偏廢。</p>
<p>試分析各國師範敎育之內容，無不包括敎材知識，敎學技能與人格修養三方面，惟各有所偏重，就大體觀察，法國較重敎材知識，國側重方法訓練，英德則兩者並重。至關於人格修養方面，則最近德俄意諸國之課程上頗加辯哲學的陶冶。</p>
<p>意大利一九二三年之師範敎育改革，明認對於人生之廣博的哲學的理解，最爲切要，而敎學方法與敎育理論决之，我們只需略一瀏覽其敎師學院畢業考試關於「哲學與敎育」之口試項下所列舉古今哲學名著之繁多，便可想見其對於哲學的陶冶之重視。</p>
<p>在俄國敎育專科學校之課程中有唯物史觀證法，階級鬥爭史等科目；他們認爲這些學凡科是維護蘇維埃一切制度之精神的武器。在德國，訓練國民學校師資之機關，多將哲學，倫理學，美學等列入專業敎程內。對於一般德國敎育家，哲學的修養之重要，决不後於敎授技術之熟練。</p>
<p>我國師範學校之課程，在民國十一年以前，比較上側重敎材知識方而，十一年之新學制公布後，在美國敎育影響籠罩下，頗表現側重敎育學科之勢，廿二年之師範學校規程實施以來，對於此點有所矯正。關於人格修養之科目，則在淸末之師範學堂均有修身一門，民國元年之師範學校規程相沿未改，民國八年以後，改修身爲公民，民國十二年之新學制師範課程標準綱耍以「人生哲畢」爲必修科目，十六年以後，師範學校課程首列「黨義」最近二十二年之師範學校規程再設公民科。按公民科之內容，通常以政治經濟等公民常識爲主，與意德之哲學科目，或蘇聯之「社會科學一含義有廣狹之別。爲完成師資敎育之人格的修養方面，似宜擴充公民科之內容，除了授以公民生活所必備的各種常識以外，允其要留意，形成其偉大的人生理想與崇高的職業道德；至於師範學校之一般訓導方針，對於敎師人格修養上關係之密切更不待言。</p>
<p>師範敎育非僅爲一種藝業的訓練，而乃一種專業之準備。</p>
<p>藝業Trade與專家Profession之區別，在於前者專注重實踐的技術之熟練，而後者則須以高深學理植其根基。往日小學敎師之訓練方式與工商界之學徒制相似，其被人目爲一種藝業不爲無因。現前，因敎育及心理科學之進步，從事敎育工作者非具備充分之敎育學識不爲功；同時叉因現代小學之功能增廣，爲敎師者更有充實共普通敎育基礎之必要。由於專業知識進步，與普通敎育提高，小學敎育工作遂由藝業而進於專業之地位，其結果，一方面爲敎師之社會的地位隨同提高，他方面爲敎師所負之社會的責任亦相應的加重。國家旣以未來的國民之敎育付託於敎師，爲敎師者自當以努力實現國家之敎育目的爲己任，無負國家之付託。（完）</p>

<h3>埠際足球試賽　中華昨慘敗於西聯　六比一開東華慘敗新紀錄　告十二碼球得免全軍覆沒</h3>
<p>港　埠際足球、已定廢歷元旦、在上海舉行、上海隊試賽、昨日東華西聯兩隊、舉行補賽於申園、東華競以六與一之比、敗得不堪收拾、上半時西聯以比一佔先、東華昨日僅中第一球之十二碼球、否則全軍敗覆、西聯集西人之精華、一般技術、在東華之上、下半時東華全線陷於極端紛亂之境、六比一結束、敞露屬幸事也、觀眾並不擁擠、四五千人而已、</p>
<p>東華相形見拙</p>
<p>西聯前鋒五虎、活動非凡、動輒予東華以威脅、柯拉沙鮑塞列滿場奔走、兩冀亦似較曹賈為佳、中鋒霍和、鶴立門前、危險人物、近來華人在前鋒中之地位、孫錦順或能與霍和一爭、其餘人選之希望不多、中線錢包體係臨時加入、西聯中可疵議者兩後衛而已、東華合作工夫、昨日陷於粉碎、致使全不能一顆顏色、徐亭守門軟弱、李寗顧此失桃花汛、馮運佑尚佳、陳家球久曠沙場、卻威風依舊、前鋒可取者孫曹二人而已、雙方昨日列陣如下、</p>
<p>西聯</p>
<p>巴賽仲</p>
<p>G傑克　維克多</p>
<p>鮑休脫　考司泰　雷米迪</p>

<p>東華陣線</p>
<p>徐亨</p>
<p>李寗　關洵安</p>
<p>顧尚勤　馮運佑　周光中</p>
<p>曹秋亭　李義臣　孫錦順　陳家球　賈幼良</p>
<p>鐵腿中十二碼</p>
<p>東華開球陳家球資格業已恢復、新試腳頭、異常活躍、銀笛旣鳴、東華大舉進攻、孫錦順兵臨門下、曹秋亭猛射一腳、竟被包賽仲輕輕救出、幼良再度攻門、球又高越、李義臣三度進襲、又被維克多救出、大好良機、皆成虛空、四座惋惜不置、柯拉沙得球進襲、方至中途、即被運佑截回、球至幼良腳下、一腳傳中、秋亭再攻、巴賽仲送諸綱後、幼良開角球、客串之西商傑克、在線前犯規、鐵腿立罰十二碼、砰然中的、東華先開紀錄、時僅五分鐘耳、</p>
<p>良機一失再失</p>
<p>西聯反攻、聲勢洶湧、直逼東華、柯拉沙在左方截得一球、正可對門力射、不料連球亦未曾踢得、深為東華慶、顧尚　得球前進、維克多從後一推、罰任教球、直送門下、賈幼良竟亦遠飛天外、孫錦順在門前與柯拉沙同樣之一球、亦踢於柱外、東華二度妙機、惜皆目送飛鴻、於是一轉身、霍和傳小華特、反為所中、成一比一、</p>
<p>一比三居下風</p>
<p>西聯之勢、從此轉盛、盤旋東華門前不去、鮑塞列得霍和之傳、一腳高球、徐亨憑其排球身手、隨手一撩、不料撩中門極彈進、所謂球運不佳者如此、傑美華特、在離門二十餘碼之斜線上猛射、飛來如矢、又為中的、上半時東華乃以此三比一之數、屈居下風、</p>
<p>竟成落花流水</p>
<p>陳家球原居右前衛、　志反攻、改列前鋒、然下半時起、亦僅五分鐘之攻勢耳、　　西聯之門、孫錦順在亂人之中、提起鐵腿、凱知又中門極、抱頭嘆息、如此互攻者二十分鐘、福恩節球急進、西聯五虎、排山倒海而來、霍和一蹴而中、徐亨呆若木雞、又五分鐘鮑休脫頭頂送中、徐亨仆地抱球、柯拉沙盜不放鬆、趕上踢人、成五比一、東華軍無門志、亂得不可收拾、霍和攻門、張金海竟倒戈而自己送入、最後之比數為六比一、</p>

<h3>一九三五年世界經濟之回顧</h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>—三大特徵之分析—</p>
<p>一九三五年世界經濟之特徵，由三個問題表現了出來，第一是美國的N.R.A.（國家業産復興法案）的崩潰（五月），第二是歐洲所爆發的意阿戰爭（十月），第三是遠東所發生的中國銀本位之放棄（十一月），這三個問題都具有深刻的意義，其發生的區域及其内容，雖不相同，但如把這各個问題，均當作世界資本主義經濟之一環來觀察時，則這三個問題的分析，即可看出世界資本主義經濟在一九三五年中，已進展到了歷史的那一個階段。</p>
<p>（一）美國N.R.A.崩潰的敎訓</p>
<p>美國N.R.A.的崩潰在一九三五年世界經濟中起有什麽作用，及其有什麽歷史的意義呢？這可分這樣幾點來説：</p>
<p>第一，從N.R.A.實施兩年間的成績來看，即可看出一般流俗學者及資本家們所幻想的美夢，即所謂資本主義的[計劃經濟]，是充滿如何的欺騙性，第二，資本主義的計劃經濟不過是暫時防止現社會秩序的動摇，挽救其崩潰的危機，甚至從而提高資本家的資本利潤而已。這種方法並不起刺激或引起正賞的經濟好轉或景氣，即不過是使社會經濟[恐慌]的階段，暫時的轉移到[蕭條]的階段，並不能達到[興盛]的地步，</p>
<p>第三，為要解决恐慌進程中這種經濟矛盾而起的社會法西政治，對於實際的經濟問題之解决，其力量是微弱得很的。</p>
<p>爲了N.R.A.的失敗，在美國各種運動隨之發生，如被稱爲過激的所謂[富之再分配]卡夫林等所代表，隨之而起，但是資本家的和平革命運動，終究是個一驚即破的幻夢，意大利很爽快的把戰爭之幕首先揭開，德意志的希脫拉大擴軍備，在後臺亦已化裝完整，日本，蘢軍着東亞和平的假面，實行對華進攻，這種種因素，根本的動摇了資本主義經濟機構的安定力，使由N.R.A.所代表的那種維護固有經濟機搆的力量，不得不更進一步，走上極端的道路，這道路便是由各國資本主義政治的[計劃經濟]，走上[軍事]的統制經濟之必然的歸宿。</p>
<p>這種傾向在一九三五年已水到渠成，到一九三六年必至加强而好山洪暴發。以前所稱爲[不流血革命]的和平的計劃經濟，無異是分去質的突變，而不過给予戰爭的軍事統制經濟以基礎。結果，必然的將本思挽救資本主義之經濟危機的和平方案，轉化爲暴露資本主義之矛盾，並求最後解决的第二次世界大戰而已。</p>
<p>美國N.R.A.的實騐及其失敗，可作爲資本主義的最高機能所謂[資本主義的計劃經濟]究有怎樣的作用。美國實施的全部結果，不外是：（一）這種計劃經濟的欺詐性，（二）並不能使經濟走上景氣的常軌，（三）反而更激起反對N.R.A.的更右傾政治的抬頭，N.R.A.揭出了社會主義的旗幟，所謂縮短工作時間，增加工資，减少失業等等好聽的口號，在起初，確曾引起一部份愚魯的資本家的恐怖與不安，並取得若干勞動者的喜悅及擁護，世界各國的俗學者，也以爲理想的社會主義制度在美國逐漸實現了，此後，改造世界社會經濟的革命已有了和蘇聯不同的第二條道路。事實上怎樣呢？</p>
<p>美國兩年來的實騐，很清楚的擺在吾人面前，N.R.A.何嘗調節了原有的勞資關係，更又何曾改善了美國人民大衆的生活！</p>
<p>在一九三五年瓦爾加的年報第一季報告上，對於N.R.A.曾特設一欄，並加以正確的分析，其中有一節大意説：</p>
<p>N.R.A.中的第七條，（即所謂勞動條項）其用意所在，不過是由於銀行信用制度的崩壞，以及農業勞動者的不滿，增强了騷動而已。資本家利用這法案，以進行其通貨膨脹政策，並救濟諸企産的破産，利用國庫中的巨欵，以援助其本身的利益所以有若干大資本家有好些時候，反而抑制那些N.R.A.的反對者祗要N.R.A.賦予工人的怠工罷工等權利取消，即爲滿足，這不是無因的[不過，由於N.R.A.的實施，在許多場合，終於給予了若干資本家以很大的損失，因之，不久便有許多資本家對於該法案公然反抗起來，代表他們意志的最高法院的判决，便見代表他們反對的表示。</p>
<p>[N.R.A.本來祗是對於人民大衆之生存的掙扎一種撫慰與緩和，有若干部份，都是對於資本家有用的，如規定獨占價格，托辣斯的解禁等條例，差不多都實行了，祗有對於他們不利的第七條，遲遲未見實現，到後來，關於勞動總同盟，　體交涉權等問題，還是以功妙的欺騙方以　　了遠去]</p>
<p>例如他們對於因工時縮短，工資增加所受業者固更無出路，即就業的勞動者的生活，因物價的高漲，甚且反而惡劣。觀乎兩年來美國總同盟罷工運動的頻發，即可知道。</p>
<p>在N.R.A.若干對於資本家有用的條項完成了後，所剩下的祗有與他們不利的條項時，必然的，該法案遭受到了嚴厲的攻擊，以至廢棄。最高法院的判决，便是在該法案對於大資本家已被咬到没有了肉，祗稽下骨頭的時候。如互爾加引用當時紐約泰唔十報的評論所說：[最高法院對於N.R.A.的，這種判决，幸而是遲至這個時候。如在N.R.A.正被大家所??望其實現在時候，則這判决對於各方面都是有害的。現在，這法案巴完成了其使命，失却了其作用，法官不過把大家已認爲死去了的東西，宜告其死去而已，]</p>
<p>我們再從實際的情形來看，N.R.A.究給了那種人以利益。據國際銀行的調查，握有約一千五百所工廠及商店的美國最大股份公司營業决算報告，該公司在一九三二年曾負債九千七百萬元，但到一九三三年却有六億四千萬元的純利，到一九三四年，這一年的純利增加至十億五千百萬元。這表示些什麽呢？</p>
<p>與此相反，這接生産者的生活並没有什麽改善。加入勞動總同盟的工人失業者比率雖略形减少，而全體工廠中，就業工人的數量增加極微，以其數量反不及一九三零年這一點來看，即可知道。詳細情形，略如下表；</p>
<p>美國近年來就業及失業統計（一九二三——二五年1基數一○○）</p>
<p>一九三五年一月，對於一九三二年之六四，雖已回復到九一，但即使如此，仍趕不上一九三零年（恐慌第二年）之九六，而三五年之八月，却又减至八六，最後數月，雖尙無數字，但因歐洲及極東問題的嚴重，恐其指數更將低落。最近美國的物價及股票價格飛漲，那是大家豫想新的通貨脹漲政策即將實現所致（雖如此，但仍趕不上一九三零年），一般人如徒然表面觀察，（一）爲美國眞的已由不景氣中克服過來，這祗要一看生産指數，即可知道美國的經濟基礎是在怎樣的不安定中。</p>
<p>這現象並不神秘，祗是資本主義經濟的一種正常的矛盾，它把生産技術及手段的水凖提到極高，而現存的經濟結構中，已無其發展的餘地（主要的如購買力及市場的消竭），必然限制其正當的成長，而使之陷於恐慌之中。如最近日本的棉紡工業，亦遭受了同樣的危機，其主因也是由於生産技術的高度發展，因而引起對於實際需要的矛盾。</p>
<p>N.R.A.的實施及其失敗，雖則祗似是美國一國的問題，但可以之來代表及暴露所有其他國家的所謂資本主義的計劃經濟之實質，——這個潮流曾掀起一九三五年世界經濟之最大的風雲，曾爲許多人所迷信。</p>
<p>（二）意阿戰爭與世界經濟</p>
<p>如把意阿戰爭僅認爲是意大利與阿比西尼亞兩國之間的事，實是極大的錯誤。意阿戰爭不但具有世界史的意義，而也就是這次的戰爭，把今日世界資本主義經濟已走上了怎樣的階段，充分地暴露了出來。意阿戰爭是整個地球上各種勢力鬥爭的縮形，各方面政治的，經濟的，外交的鬥爭都積晶於這個戰爭，也將於這個戰爭而散佈開來。</p>
<p>意阿戰爭的最重要敎訓，便是所謂維持世界和平的政治的力量，最具體實現於所謂和平　鬥之國際聯盟的，是怎樣的無力。同時，由於意阿戰爭關端，我們看到各資本主義各國間，摩挲擦掌，對於戰爭，均已跃跃欲試，世界第二次大戰之幕，是已怎樣迫切地即將被揭開。</p>
<p>自然，在其根本的幕後主動者或提　人，還是現有矛盾所結凝下來的世界經濟恐慌。有若干現象，因爲具有多少政治的或外交的因素，有人即認爲這是政治的或外交的問題，這自然是把問題的性質完全歪曲了。意阿戰爭所表示的，亦即如此。</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌自發生以來，到一九三二年告一段落，一九三二年以後，漸由[恐慌]，而向[蕭條]的循環路上進行，這並不能即説是好轉，無論何時，仍是停滯在不景氣的階段。爲什麽不能由[蕭條]更邁進而至於[興??]呢？那便受着資本主義經濟根本的法則所支配，簡單地説，也就是創造其發生的本身社會關係，限制了它的發展。</p>
<p>就是以由[恐慌]而進到[蕭條]這一個轉向來説吧，亦不是由於正常的經濟生長。我們看到近年間各國的生産指數略有若干上昇，但促使這上昇的最大原因，並不是需要的擴展，而是由於國際間政治的不安，引起了軍備競爭的深化，於是就來了這種[火藥氣味]的景氣。這種火藥氣味的景氣由二方面形成。</p>
<p>第一，是直接的軍需工業的發展，第二，是國内食料自给政策的推進，換言之，兩者都無非是爲作戰而凖備。一九三五年各國生産額的增加，其最大的成份都是由於戰爭凖備而來。</p>
<p>這，我們祗要看，各國的生産指數是相當的增加了，而國際貿易不曾合比率的發展，於是，即可知道這種景氣是怎樣的性質。</p>
<p>食料自給政策的施行，使施行這政策的國家的農産物騰貴，一方面固然激發了本國的農業，但同時使農業國家的輸出减少，陷於嚴重的苦境；結果必致使農業國家對於進口的工業品購買力减削，債務支付困難，其結果必然走上强化國外匯兌之路，這樣，對於工業品輸出國家，给予了嚴動的打擊，結果，即有若干景氣的萌芽，亦必被立即摧殘下來。</p>
<p>國際貿易不振，世界經濟雖有部份的好轉，即無整個回復之可能。這種情形不但在一九三五年中爲然，即自一九三三年以來，即已如此，惟到一九三五年，政治的不安更又加重了這種危機，意阿戰爭即是這種關係的表現。</p>
<p>其次，意阿戰爭所昭示的，呈世界民地再分割運動的開展。大槪，在殖民地競爭中得到勝利的國家，即佔有最多殖民地的國家，所感受於世界經濟恐慌的威脅，較之那些殖民地較少的資本主義的國家，譬如，英.法.美.他們之所以能够把恐慌轉化爲[蕭條]，主要的還得歸功於殖民地的衆多，在他們一感受到世界經濟恐慌的威脅時，即加重對於他們殖民的剝削，把恐慌的負擔移轉於他們的殖民地上面，所以，他們不但能有所恃而無恐，而且還可使他們的局勢好轉。</p>
<p>但是，在以前殖民地分割戰中落伍或後進的國家，對於嚴重的世界經濟恐慌的襲來，即感到無法應付，他們爲維持社會的原狀，祗有强化獨裁政治，使國内的秩序安定於一時。但這僅見一種興奮劑，未能持久，到第二次再受到危機的威脅時，他們便只有去找求殖民地這一帖藥劑。</p>
<p>然而，世界殖民地重要的部份，均早已有了主人，在殖民地戰爭中新進的國家，祗有轉移目光於那列强勢力較弱的地方去發展。意大利之所以選定阿比西尼亞，即由於此。</p>
<p>在同期間内，意之對亞，與日之對華，在原則上是相同的，但意阿戰爭會引起這樣嚴重的國際糾紛，而列强對於日本在滿洲及華北的發展，反較似袖手旁觀，其中不是没有原因的，因如兩者情形有若干不同之處在：</p>
<p>第一，中日僻處遠東，在地理上，與歐美列强有很大的距離，直接干涉，自必較爲不便。所以，在若干的範围以内，日本勢力的發展，是列强所能認可的，並不如阿比西尼亞似的，與列强的勢力有唇齒的關係。</p>
<p>第二，被視爲世界之怪物的蘇聯，是各資本主義國家的公敵，日本即以防衛蘇聯勢力爲藉口，在這種情形下，還可向各國討好。</p>
<p>第三，日本在口號上所揭　的是東亞和平，而意大利則公言對阿的討伐，這不但對於國聯的面子有關，而其大膽更是使列强難堪。</p>
<p>此外，意阿戰爭不僅表白了今日世界資本主義經濟維持的困難，以及由戰爭來清算這矛盾的危機之深化，還表示出，相應於這種經濟的極右傾的政治，其最高的發展是走上了什麽樣的路。</p>
<p>（三）中國幣制改革的意義</p>
<p>N.R.A.的崩潰，是資本主義國家本國的動向之序幕，意阿戰爭是資本主義國家國際間糾紛之初型，而中國幣制改革，則又作爲資本主義國家犠牲品的殖民地或半殖民地經濟的變動，——三者合觀，更足以充分的表露出一九三五年世界經濟之特性來。</p>
<p>中國銀本位的放棄，最主要的自然要感謝美國銀政策的殘酷的賜予。這次貨幣變動雖名曰改革，但如把改革兩字加積極的意義來解釋，就根本不是那會事。所謂改革，事實上無非是中國銀本位貨幣的恐慌及其没落。正如不久以前各金本位的國家，因金的流出，不得已而放棄金本位一樣，中国也在同樣情形下，不得不和銀本位宜告分離。</p>
<p>中國，爲了維持這次貨幣恐慌的殘局，曾多次的懇求美國的[紳士們]要改變銀政策，然而美國垣街的幾位慈悲爲懷的紳士們，爲了本身的[利潤]，把四萬萬的中國貧苦人民榨了油，也是不會轉動一下眼球的。</p>
<p>實則這又何必　怪垣街的紳士們，因爲資本主義的本質便是這樣殘酷的東西。不過，在近數十年來，像美國銀團一下把中國原有貨幣制度擊潰，這樣殘酷的偉績，確也是少見的。</p>
<p>英國的資本就乘這個機會，由羅斯的中介　餘，企圖吞下中國的貨幣權。這表示在世界殖民地戰爭中，可契的東西愈來愈少，對於中國這塊雖瘦而很大的肉，自必誰也不肯放過。</p>
<p>中國貨幣改革後，英日在遠東的經濟　戰爭必然的進上了尖銳化之路。其結果，羣犬爭食一塊肉，把肉食完了，更進而咬骨頭——這是中國在列强殖民地戰爭中當前的運命。</p>
<p>自然，在嚴格的意義上，中國的銀本位之放棄全由於美國銀政策，那話也有些過份。此外當然還有許多因素，這許多因素之中，主要的一個，不能不說是財政的困難。這在世界的觀點來說，是有重要的關係的。其次，即以貨幣改革爲道棧，産生了華北問題。這種種變動都是表示列强對華侵略的深化。</p>
<p>在一九三五年，帝國主義魔掌的陰影已達到了中國各部門，殘酷的悲劇必然會在一九三六年逐幕演出，[怒吼罷，中國！]也正其時了！</p>
<h3>世界石油戰爭</h3>
<p>— （何冰）</p>
<p>火藥景氣中的石油工業</p>
<p>自從意大利揭開了戰爭之幕，列强間在後台排演已久的全武行傑作，有立卽開演之勢。其時，作爲這武劇之工具的各種重要軍事工業，自必特别受到注意，由第一次世界大戰所得的敎訓，石油問題遂成爲衆自注視的焦點之一。自從英法等國的紳士在國聯大禮堂中提出了對意經濟封鎖的口號，禁油卽成爲嚴重問題，國際的石油托辣斯，正和軍火商們一樣，乘機大活躍起來，什麽美孚公司和意政府訂立密約呀，意國给予某石油托辣斯以若干年特許販賣權呀等等風傅，轟動各方。自從近日英國外相霍爾辭職，英意在地中海的對立更形激化以來，石油問題遂更引起各方的注意。</p>
<p>自第一次世界大戰後，卽已有了，[石油帝國主義]的稱謂，石油，對於各資本主義的國家，已不僅是單純的經濟作用，而早已含有政治及軍事的嚴重意義。主要列强（尤其是英美國）間，對於世界石油資源的再分割，以及販賣市塲的爭奪，彼此??心鈎角，可謂由來已久。大戰以後，石油問題曾多次的作爲國際會議的要題，但至今没有解决的頭緒，正如軍縮會議無結果而引起各國的軍備競爭一樣，[石油政策]或[石油國策]成了資本主義國家要政之一。隨着近年來汽車及各種自動車數量的增加，石油問題更隨之嚴重。</p>
<p>在一九一四至一九一八的第一次世界大戰中，石油對於軍事的意義，已爲列强所認識，在一九一六年二月至三月的一次大戰中，戰塲上軍士，補充兵，糧麥，輜重等的運送，動員汽車上萬輛之多。一九一八年七月十五日法國的一次勝利，卽得力於戰車汽車的優越，德國的軍隊則如石油缺乏所苦。所以，在戰後和約成立時一次會議中，有一個代表說：[各方來的石油，有助於擊敗德軍之功不少，鐵與煤固是德軍優越，而石油則爲我軍優越，就好了在石油上佔了優越，終使我軍得了勝利，將來戰爭采：[戰事石油供給論])。</p>
<p>石油是汽車，戰車，飛機，等的動力，在第一次大戰中，這種工具還不甚發達，現在，鐵甲車，汽車，飛機等較前大爲增加，石油的地位自必更形重要。而且世界石油的産量，且有不及需要的增加好速之勢，兩者比較，有如下表：</p>
<p>一九三四年世界各種自動車燃料的消費，計六千七百五十萬瓲，其中包括汽船及電車，據斯頓敎授的估計，一九三四年電車的消費額計六千萬瓲。一九一○年商船軍艦所用的燃料還以煤爲主，據倫敦的調查，當時總噸數四千二百萬噸的船舶用石油五十二萬噸，到一九三四年，六千四百萬噸中，用石油的增　三千萬噸。</p>
<p>最近各種自動車的發達，和戰爭是有密切的關係的。</p>
<p>在工業衰落，商品减少的年頭，而汽車公路建設却非常發達，這是可注意的事。據美國商務部的調查，一九二九年世界汽車路計有六千五百萬里，在經濟恐慌時中，竟有二百六世萬里的增加。在這時期之中，各國在殖民地均努力於汽車公路之建設，如法國在摩洛哥，赤道菲洲，以及印度支那等地，意大利在利比亞，荷蘭在荷屬印度，英國在菲洲各殖民地，所新建的汽車公路，爲數頗巨。有的公路竟長至三千里。歐洲以外，如加拿大，澳洲，紐錫蘭，中國，墨西哥，等地，對於汽車公路的建設，也頗積極。這種建設的目的主要的無非是爲了軍事的戰略關係，以便軍隊及輜重的運送，得以便利。</p>
<p>飛機怎樣呢：其發達有如下表</p>
<p>商業航空綫之競爭，也趨激化。一九三四年中，英國的[英倍利阿爾?愛亞愛伊斯]（譯音）社所經營的澳洲——印度——英國——南菲的直達連絡航路完成。法國的[愛爾?法蘭西]社所經營的法國至默塔加斯加爾之間的航路。及意大利以及東菲意國殖民地定期航空路綫建設的計劃，都是很重要的。德國的航空競爭也日見激化，除注意於通過大西直達南美的定期航空路綫外，又定下了連絡遠東的定期航空計劃。美國國内的航綫多已完成，轉而注意於大西洋北部的航路。荷蘭的通荷屬東印度航綫，是在航空紀錄上很著名的。</p>
<p>這種航綫，雖云商業性，而且大部由商業機關出面，但是，均由政府從國庫中給予大量的補助，其故又爲何呢？那很明白，就是因爲所謂商業性的航空路綫建設，多少也均帶有戰爭凖備的意義。</p>

<p>惟「合羣」可以担當大事。在羣策　力之下，作了團結一致努力的工作，祇有那前進的團體幸福，沒有那前進的個人私利，持此毅力，一德一心，可以衝破任何困難的環境。論到環境的好惡，終由於人的力量造就的。所以好的環境，我們要去保持它，惡的環境，我們要去擊碎它。因爲天下最具有力量的，除了人，沒有再比他有力量的了。</p>
<p>「夏少康以一成一旅而中興，」這就是我們最好的楷模。以沉着堅毅的决心，來領導作那羣策盡力的工作；奮鬥！努力！去求我們的新生命綫。</p>

<h3>伐木者</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>劈拍劈鼕鼕……劈拍劈鼕鼕……這是東北關外山岡上伐木的斧聲。</p>
<p>普通工作，多分是在白天陽光下幹的，或是像工廠裹日夜輪流做的也有，祇有伐木却是例外，日裹倒不動手，偏在黑夜裹開始工作，若說生怕猛獸要傷人，那也不對，野獸只有晚間活躍得厲害，這大槪是他們的習慣吧！</p>
<p>他們憑着：臂膀的力氣堅定的精神，來解决麫包問題，在半明半暗的油火燈下，努力工作着！工作着！大冷天，雖然凜冽的寒氣，凍透了身體，呼呼的朔風，刀刺般刮來，但他們一點也沒有嘆息，一點也沒有畏縮，從上更的時分做起，「劈拍劈鼕鼕」，「劈拍劈鼕鼕」，直做到天明才歇手，一班初到北地起早身的人，無意間推窗遙望，有時瞧見山岡上一隻隻的白羊，疑是昨夜誰家散失的羊羣，其實那裹是白羊，却是遍體濃霜的伐木者。</p>
<p>以上，是在束北的一個朋友，對我這般說的。</p>
<h3>鴉片軼話</h3>
<p>— 錐心</p>
<p>蕭實齋觀察，生平深惡洋烟，其任濟東道時，嘗批某令文牘曰：「大烟之臭，甚於大糞！」語雖粗俗然亦事實也。蓋鴉片在未燒至成熟時，本有異臭，今癮君子不聞其臭反覺其香者，是亦猶日處鮑魚之肆，遂忘其本味也。</p>
<p>劉忠誠坤一，烟癮極大，惟尚有節制，其任江西巡撫時，每早由侍者預先裝就烟泡十餘個，每個的一錢上下，劉醒後，一氣連續吸盡，然後梳洗進膳，辦理公事，終日亦不再吸。一日，與某觀察論時事，某觀察謂：「湘淮各營，暮氣已深，宜練新軍，方可支持大厦。」劉聞言，拂然不悅曰：「如君高才博學，海內知名，然亦不過書中之蟲耳。」觀察大怒曰：「吾雖書蟲，然猶較烟鬼爲愈也！」劉大慚。而「烟鬼撫台」之稱，遂傳播於一時矣。</p>
<h3>將與誰握手？</h3>
<p>徐桐，爲淸季著名頑錮黨，排洋之意極堅，凡物之有「洋」字者，一律拒用。有饋以墨西哥幣者，輒不受，謂墨西哥幣是「洋錢」也。或有詰以：「公如此惡洋，何以尚食洋烟？」徐大慚，遂毀具折槍，矢志不食，翌日，癮發，涕泗交流，委　欲死，於是有陷者淸吿之日：「洋烟雖來自外洋，今則中　亦能自種矣，如雲土卽係產自雲南者，雲南之烟，豈得謂之洋烟耶？」徐聞言頓喜，遂復開戒。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十三回　繞室發高談奮將起訴　傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌</p>
<p>茶房道：這兩個人是去拜訪藍專員的，談了很久的話，就打聽賈先生在家不在家。我因爲賈先生睡着了不願意驚動你，就說你老出去了，沒有回來。他們也就沒有說什麼，各丟下一張名片，敎我交給你老。賈多才道：可是這個人，我並不認得，他們拜訪我作什麼？茶房微笑道：他們是什麼意思，賈先生你自己還能够不知道嗎？我給你老打盆水洗臉罷。說完了這話，他笑着一扭身子，端了臉盆，就笑着出去了。賈多才看他那樣子，就知道這裏面另有文章，心裹就在那裏忖度着，不要他們眞幹我一下子吧？人財兩空之外，自己還要鬧一塲官司，這未免不値。於是坐在椅子上，將五個手指頭輸流的在桌上敲打着，表示那鎭靜之中，還帶一分愉快的樣子。等茶房進來了，他還帶了笑容，輕輕的唱着戲道：我本當，不打魚，家中閑坐，無奈我家貧窮，無計奈何。喂！茶房，西安城裹，怎麼除了聽陝西梆子，就沒有可以去玩的地方。茶房放下臉盆，向他望了一望，笑答道：你先生今天晚上還去聽戲嗎？賈多才道：爲什麼不去聽？這樣一個女人，我不過一百五十塊錢買來的，丟了就丟了，那裹放在我的心上。不過我雖不放在心上，社會上這樣詐欺騙財的事，斷不能容忍，必定要處罰他一下子，才免得社會上的人學樣。茶房，你看我這種官司，還有打不贏的道理嗎？但不知道那女孩子倚靠着什麼，有這樣大的膽，居然敢不回來。茶房微笑着，沒有答復，自走了出去。賈多才又站起來，左手握住了右手的緊拳頭，反在身背後，在屋子裹打了幾個旋轉，一頓脚，自言自語的道：打官司也好，反正我不能再受什麼罰吧？那茶房又進來了，手上可有一張名片，遞給他笑道：外面有一位新聞記者要見賈先生。賈多才接過名片看了一看，躊躇着道：我也並不是什麼要人，新聞記者訪問我幹什麼，（三九〇）</p>
<h3>窮人的水汀</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>彤雲密佈的天空，緊緊地追來了呼呼的西北風。一會兒，又飄着鵝翎般的大雪，頃刻之問，把大地變成一個銀色世界。</p>
<p>資產階級的人們，在高大的立體建築物裹，開放了水汀，或把火爐加足了媒塊，生出熊熊的火焰。外面雖下着大雪，屋內好似三春天氣，並不覺得天寒。</p>
<p>可是無資產階級的人們，在這樣嚴冬的天氣，縮着身子戰慄，寒氣又無情地使勁逼人，雙手的皮膚，已成了龜裂，天哪，窮人們怎樣能度過這個殘酷的寒冬呢？</p>
<p>但是「天無絕人之路」，伊們在天氣十分寒冷的時候，就化上十來銅子，跑進浴室的門，就感到一陣暖意，因爲裹面裝有火爐。把衣服脫得精光，迅捷地向浴池內一鑽，把整個的身體都沉浸在熱水中，好溫暖呵！不啻是最好的水汀，是窮人們名副其實的水汀。</p>
<p>洗去了身上的塵垢，享受了舒適的溫暖，却捨不得離開這—水汀—，被時間的壓迫，只好跨出浴室的門檻，冒着寒風，急向家中跑，在厚舖稻草的床上，身上蓋了一條硬而又破的棉被，度過了冬之夜。</p>
<h3>時髦與痛苦</h3>
<p>時候到了初冬，天氣漸漸的冷了·一般站在『新女性』綫上的姊妹們，妝飾要摩登化，把藕臂完全裸露着，而兩隻玉腿，也祇穿雙絲襪，一任朔風的侵襲。我們見了，眞有些『不寒而慄』呢！但是伊們的上半身，什麼絨綫衫呀，呢大衣呀，……合乎時代美的新妝，早就加上了。所以伊們對於這樣嚴寒的氣候，未嘗不覺得是冷的。至於露臂裸腿的用意，不是我說句侮辱女性的話，大槪爲的是『表現肉戚』，要想取悅於異性。不然，也脫不了時髦心的驅使。但是把雪白的皮肉，凍得發紫，說不定要受那『寒腿病』和『凍瘡』的痛苦呢！</p>
<p>唉！爲愛時髦而受痛苦，眞太寃枉了！（麟昌）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「最後一課」與放假</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>「最後一課」確是極悲痛的！</p>
<p>當華北時局陷入嚴重狀態的時候，平市學生覺到已在上「最後一課，」於是便發動一個學生運動。未幾，各地學生，也看見「最後一課」已迫，就大家急起響應。多年死寂的民氣，頓時給這「最後一課」的警吿，喚醒過來！</p>
<p>近來的中國學生，是極有覺悟的。他們知道「最後一課」上完之後，自己便不是祖國的國民，不能再有機會受祖國的敎育。九一八前夕，東北的學生曾上過「最後一課，」他們現在已放下自己的書本，在受一種奴隸敎育。北平學生鑒於東北同胞亡省的慘禍，寗願在「最後一課」未散課之先，用自己的熱血，去作最後的掙扎，而不甘忍辱下去，讓學校任敵人來管轄！</p>
<p>學生運動是「最後一課」迫出來的，這大家應認識淸楚。可惜社會上對學生運動，表示同情的人雖多，但抱反對態度的，也屬不少。一部分敎育界人士，他們不能站在學生的同一方面，指導學生作救國的工作，已算失職，竟想盡方法，來壓制學生的愛國行動，這是如何痛心的事！</p>
<p>現在北平各大學，已實行提前放假，這是防止學生運動一個最巧妙的方法。平市學生迫於「最後一課，」受不起敵人飛機的威脅，故出來發動學生運動，希望用自己的熱血，去挽回華北的危局。但在平敎育當局，好像覺得學生的行動，是過於神經過敏，因之阻止於前，又放假於後。這樣，連「最後一課，」也就無法上下去！</p>
<p>當北平各大學紛紛放假之際，獨有北京大學，仍繼續上課，但不幸已有幾個愛國學生，受到警吿的處分。北大校長蔣夢麟，近發表談話，謂「本校勸導學生復課，係為國家民族，以及各學生的前途着想，……學生運動，至相當地步，卽須收塲，否則結果必不能完滿，……我愛國家，愛民族，尤愛熱血的學生，惟不忍見更大更恥辱的事件，在將來演出，影響整個平市的敎育……」難　學生運動收塲之後，更大更恥辱的事件，便不會在將來演出嗎？要知近日全國學生的舉行愛國運動，目的無非卽在防止將來更大更恥辱事件的發生！</p>
<p>好在北平放假現已先後實行，一般學生，亦並不因學校放假，而停止救國的工作。師範大學於放假期內，研究非常時期的敎育問題，以備改革華北敎育。學生聯合會及各學校，則大半注重聯絡宣傳的工作。其情形可得而言者：一，淸華大學脚踏車隊，於元旦抵德州，因女隊員有病，俟休養後，繼續前進，二，燕京大學學生五十人，八日集合淸河，分發附近的鄉村講演，三，北大醫學院救護隊二十餘人，七日赴固安，擴大宣傳隊，四，學生聯合會宣傳隊第一第二兩團，七日抵琉璃河，第三團至固安，五，東北大學宣傳隊，六日在萬壽寺演愛國劇。（聞是日觀眾有農民千餘人，警察出加干涉，經糾察隊與以對抗，僵持甚久。）</p>
<p>馬相伯先生在「告復旦同學書」中，有一段說：「為諸君計，與其呼籲政府，莫如開導人民，街頭巷尾，茶寮酒肆，皆諸君為國宣力處也。」我們現在旣呼籲政府無門，那末開導人民，應是一種最有益國家的工作。我敢以此勸全國的愛國學生。</p>
<h3>元寳魚</h3>
<p>— 許傑</p>
<p>「媽，今天吃魚？」小寳看見菜籃里一條魚跳到地面上來時，比着他身上那件破棉襖第一天上身時更快活地呌了起來。</p>
<p>小寳的媽今天一早上小菜塲的，因為新年，她盤算着要做四碗葷菜。天下着雪，她懷了六毛小洋從小菜塲的這端走到那端，再從那端折回來，終於祗買了一條魚，一塊肉，幾個蛋及一點蔬菜；沒有像她預計着能做到四碗葷菜，而六毛錢是化光了。到了家，還獨自嚕咕着賣菜的沒有好良心，到新年時候都是拚命漲價，從前六毛錢可以做五碗一湯了。這股無名之火沒法平下去，就把菜籃恨恨地從地上一摔，自己跌倒那張燒火矮櫈上；其實這對馬蹄樣的小脚，在濘滑的路上走了許多時候，也懶得動彈了。但是那條元寳魚却從籃裏跳了出來，或許牠是在感到將遭殺身之禍之前的最後掙扎，或許牠不慣在低濕的屋裏作階下之囚，捲着尾巴接着跳了幾下。</p>
<p>小寳七歲了，但從出世以來就沒有嚼過葷腥，每餐是一碟子自醃菜，媽還是在旁邊喊着快吃飯，不許多鉗一筷的。現在籃子裏有肉有蛋，還有一尾鮮活的魚，小寳想用手去抓牠起來的時候，被媽喊住了：</p>
<p>「不許動，　菩薩的！」</p>
<p>小寳不懂菩薩是什麽東西，但是媽虎起了臉他是懂得的；那末，菩薩一定是比爸爸還要利害的東西。因為爸和媽相打的時候，媽總是把爸的東西亂摔亂敲，現在這尾菩薩的魚就不許小寳動一動手。小寳呆住了，他用老虎，野貓，一切最可怕的東西來想像菩薩，同時又貪婪地注視着籃裏的肉，蛋，地上的菩薩的魚。</p>
<p>小寳的媽媽因為心痛着六毛錢還不夠做四碗葷菜，就沒有好聲好氣，但一見了小寳呆立着的可憐樣子，想想這孩子已太苦了，自從廠裏减薪以後，他爸就從來沒有買過一點好吃的東西，孩子見了那末多的好菜，怎不喜歡得跳了起來？她把小寳抱到懷裏親着他的凍紅了的面頰低低地說：「這許多小菜　了菩薩，爸明年賺元寳回來，寳寳就有新衣服穿，好東西吃了。」</p>
<p>小寳雖然還是不知道菩薩是那模樣的，但是他常聽得爸說希望廠裏生意好，恢復從前的工資，可以快快活活過個年了，那末，小寳掄起了小眼睛想：「菩薩或者就是廠裏的外國人了。」想着小寳又快活起來，從媽的懷里跳了出來說：</p>
<p>「媽，菩薩同爸一同回來嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，好寳寳。」媽拍拍他的頭，站起身來預備做菜了。</p>
<p>晚上，那條魚用紅紙封了眼珠，由一條紅絨繩吊在窗口，桌上放着四碗菜，點起蠟燭，媽叩了頭，拖着小寳也拜了四拜。小寳就跳出跳進地等着爸回來，他要看看菩薩。那條魚在半空裏甩着尾巴，時常把窗格子拍拍打着。</p>
<p>爸回來了，一個人，沒有菩薩，小寳撲到媽懷裏說：「菩薩沒有來，那條魚殺來寳寳吃了！」</p>
<p>媽媽又親着他的臉，哄着他：「菩薩也不吃魚的，那呌元寳魚，明天拿去放生，爸爸才會賺元寳回來。」</p>
<p>小寳眞想不透菩薩倒底是什麽模樣，旣不吃魚，媽媽什麽要買來請呢？他又想着老虎，野貓，外國人，望着那條封了眼珠的元寳魚不住地打着窗格子。</p>

<h3>鄉村度歲</h3>
<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>北風呼呼地刮着整個原野，村邊的樹木已經光禿着它們的枝條了；荒草在北風的呼號裏朝着半天飛，雪花舖在平地上，堆積在山崖裏，造成了一個半壁盡白的冷酷的世界？我們趕運了最後一次的貨物到茅墩去，已經是年底了，大家歇了歇，正預備好好的過一回年，可是咧吃過了送灶飯，老閻卻又來找我們趕路了。一聽到要趕路，大家都滿不高興，竹老頭首先喁喁地咀咒着：「一年到晚還得不到一天歇歇！……」</p>
<p>我們裝好了身，把槍桿兒托在肩頭上，竹老頭還老是遲鈍地捆着他的担子，拖着衰老無力的腿兒，慢慢地跟我們朝山野間走去。這回的担子不多，連竹老頭才三條担子，我們四枝槍桿兒就把它們護送着。出了墩頭坳，大家都走很起勁，我們正打算朝着舊路走，不意頓時在三叉路口給老閻從後面喝住了。</p>
<p>我們把步子停了停，小狗子從後面趕上來說：「閻大哥呌你們朝橫路走去，小心點；下面有斜坡！」</p>
<p>這一說，頓時使我們領悟了，心裏暗暗地自慰了一下，想：「這趟徐老板要玩什麽花樣，把三担貨物運動這山邊來？路又不通，最多也不外七八個村莊，有什麽生意頭？……」然而，一想到今天不不用趕遠路，心裏就不免輕鬆了一陣，雖然風雪還是刮得那樣猛，有點象尖刀樣刺人，但是僅這捱三幾個鐘頭的路，自然容易得多了。……</p>
<p>果不出我們所料，中午就到了嶺邊村；老閻這回趕上了前頭，讓小狗子一個人落在後面，他接近了我們，就輕聲地說：「莊二，你們這幾條担子跟三枝長槍從後門進去，我吩咐莫大往後邊接你，……我先從這邊去探聽一下子」。其實我們也曉得他並不是探聽什麽的，只是他喜歡搭臭架子，所以就朝大門走去，好得跟胡大頭答訕一下應酬話。</p>
<p>老閻把他的左輪塞進棉大衣裏去，突着胖大的，擁腫的肚子，搖搖擺擺的朝着村中的大石路走去，我們換了一個方向，也就朝着一條巷子裏走。我們一分了手，竹老頭就好像受了委屈般的，喃喃自語着：「臨着年底還趕鳥路？年年有紅花，徧徧去年就沒有，說是生意淡，卻就白白把我們捱了一輩子！今天還得趕路，鬼信沒生意！……今年可不曉得怎麼着，發不發？……」大家眼白朝他翻了翻，沒說話。小狗子在揩着濃鼻涕，好象什麽事都與他沒關係似的。常常把頭縮進大領子裏，簡直象隻兔崽子。……</p>
<p>莫大把我們接進了後門，一直走進三層高的砲樓上去；上面沒有窗，小小的砲眼透露着一些澹暗的光綫，周圍有一些蜘蛛網和塵灰密佈着，頗顯得有點陰沉。樓板堆着一些零亂的傢具，靠牆邊有一張板床。我們把槍桿擱在墻上，解了皮帶，在床上坐了一下子。老閻從樓下上來，檢視着我們的皮帶，吝嗇的眼睛頻頻地朝子彈上幌着，用手指把每條皮帶上的排數數了數，然後才一起丟在床上的角落裏，吩咐着莫大：「你去請胡大爺到這裏來，看看怎麼辦？……」回頭又問問小狗子：「小瓶子裏還有生油麼？……」</p>
<p>胡大頭走了上來，我們把一担担的貨物都打開了。莫大從樓下搬上了幾個木做的大箱子，把舊報紙放在箱底下面，我們就把貨物一包一包的疊到箱子裏去。疊了一半，胡大頭從中揀出了一包，打開來看看，是幾隻黑色的大餅樣的東西，我們心裏暗地想：「媽的，原來是南貨！」然而眼睛卻當它沒有看見，埋頭在一包包的疊下去。</p>
<p>疊完了貨，老閻吩咐小狗子把一瓶生油拿了出來，給我們揩槍筒。自己卻又跟胡大頭混去了。</p>
<p>一會莫大跑來，呌我們到大廳間去吃午飯，然而卻不見老閻，聽莫大說，他先吃了飯跟胡大頭出去了，並且死了兩匹馬。一面交代莫大叮囑我們，不要隨便到外邊去，揩好了槍就在砲樓裏舖床睡覺。</p>
<p>晚上，老閻從外邊歸來，他喘着氣對我們說：「徐老板剛才有話來，呌我們在胡大爺這邊過年，今年生意雖淡，我們這幾個人倒得分點兒花紅的，……大家安心些，……替東家多做點事。……」這話的意思我們是明白的。然而我們都不做聲，靜寂地讓黑夜漸漸包圍了整個砲樓，甚至於連砲眼底一絲兒的光綫都被吞噬了。……於是平靜地，我們在鄉間度過這個年，過了這殘餘的歲暮——。</p>
<h3>家</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>孤獨地，寂寞地，臥在病榻上，窗外是晒着明朗的陽光；屋尖上一只花白色小貓，在陽光裏寂寞地偷睡，尾巴朝下安適地躺着；在那遼遠的天邊，幾朶輕淡的雲影，在緩緩地移着，顯然是一片靜。在那深巷中，一聲聲血和淚灰色的呌賣，輕輕地，輕輕地，敲在孤寂的心上吧。</p>
<p>「人在孤獨的時候才有自己」；在病中，我感到那寂寞的安靜時，目睹着這有趣寂寞如畫的景色，自己反而安靜呢。病在客地，使着我懷戀和擊念的是迢遙的家鄉吧；平常我眷戀着一些故鄉的景物和故鄉的野菜等等，然而在病中，沒有人間到自己的冷暖，沒有人關心着自己的病情，在這時古老的家是顯着的吧。</p>
<p>病中，古老的家是顯着我懷念着；在沒有陽光的家中，一切是古老，陳舊而寂寞着的呢；我是在那裏，曾過着血和淚灰色的日子，在那裏面，我是晒着賓貴的童年之淚，寂寞地邁上旅途。然而每年流浪在異鄉，也是過着血和淚的日子。在我記憶裏，我沒有忘記，那沒有陽光的家中，有着永遠寂寞着的媽媽呢，我是祝福着。</p>
<p>故鄉的景物，有時使我懷念着，可是想到那灰色的日子，自己也忘去了；病在客地，感到那寂寞的安靜時，記憶中我想着孤寂的媽媽，同沒有陽光的家底溫馨呵。（病榻偶記）</p>

<p>楊柳樓台夢不成。梧桐庭院月初昇。那伶仃孤女憑欄望。見一片凄凉月色明。勾下心頭千滴淚。那堪回首憶前情。半載之前慈母在。一家允聚樂天倫。母憐嬌女女憐母。好比那，星依皓月月依星。相隨形影不離身。快樂家庭誰不羨。終朝和好過光陰。那曉，慈愛偏遭天嫉妒。一聲霹靂奪娘親。白茫落戶母女陰陽隔。黑漫漫幽明異路分。死我親娘完我福。十六年慈愛斷了根。母親呀，你死到而今方半載。爹爹是父心腸即變更。見嫂渾忘泉下母。順風順水度晨昏。不思手是同胞妹。聽憑我，野渡無人舟自橫。都把我，萬種熬磨千種難。一言痛責半言嗔。一味欺瞞我孤弱女。我滿腔哀怨訴誰誰聽。本來人在人情在。死了人時斷了情。我一病奄奄幾不起。有誰人，烹茶煎藥伴殷勤。今宵是，强支病骨西風裏。悄對嫦娥哭幾聲。哀哀哭泣傳不到你好親娘耳。生離離，痛碎了我九兒心。問誰人，最是伶仃苦。苦命之中第一名。要算我，這晚娘手裏的女兒身。</p>

<h3>國色天香中之蘆雪</h3>
<p>上海有聲影片公司但杜宇導演之國色天香，一眸攝拍蘆蕩一幕，特向吳淞購得大批蘆竿，然後參差植立於攝影塲上，照以月光，幽皎不可名狀。昔人觀秋雪菴蘆花記有云，月夜登閣望之，白雲飄渺，淸風徐來，晶光搖曳，　漫長頃，覺此身翛然霞舉，如在水壼瓊鳥間，不復見天地人世，此境彷彿似之，劇中人為但二春與白燕。</p>
<h3>電通公演舞台劇舞台人大本營大出動</h3>
<p>新興的電通公司，是話劇界第一流演員的總匯，男的女的，對於戲劇的演技，都有過充分的修養與經騐。平時因為工作忙碌，未能全體動員，舉行大規模的公演，可是這一羣戲劇運動的中堅的中堅，對於探討舞台藝術的趣味，是未曾一日少懈。最近，經過孫師毅，司徒慧敏及李大深等提議，於最短期間，集中全體精力，舉行首次公演，以展開一九三六年的劇運。至於劇本，已於定柴霍甫的三大名著：「蠢貨」，「求婚」，「紀念日」，上列三劇，已在積極排練，預料戲劇運動銳進的一九三六年頭，戲劇的演技上必能不能放一異彩。</p>
<h3>明星積極建設攝影塲</h3>
<p>明星公司總廠的的聲攝影塲，自前奠基之後，現在積極加工趕築中，從前瓦礫滿地之荒地，現在一變而為整齊平坦之工塲，預期不久之後，此美奐美輪輪之有聲攝影塲，當能於萬千電影藝術愛好者之前落成。</p>
<p>明星有聲攝影塲，雖不敢說是怎樣空前絕後的偉大建築，但在現在這貧乏的中國電影陣地　，至少可以說，這是中國最合於攝製有　　影條件的一個攝影塲。牠除了預計到攝影上的便利，同時還更顧到錄音等等的便利的。</p>
<p>在各方面同時進行中，明年明星有聲攝影塲的成立，一定能做到增高產額，提高水準的兩個目標。</p>
<h3>介紹「花燭之夜」四金剛</h3>
<p>導演岳楓—一位有着偉大前程的導演，「中國海的怒潮」，「逃亡」，接一連二地在暮氣沉沉的中國影壇上樹立了不少奇勳，「花燭之夜」即是其改變作風後傾力製作的有聲片，成績之佳，自毋待言。</p>
<p>攝影王春泉—一位年紀很輕，勇於進取精神的有作為靑年花燭之夜，是其處女作，畫面的美麗，光綫的柔和，角度的適度，鏡頭的靈活，十足表示其豐富經騐及曾下過一番苦心，勉矣哉，偉大的靑年攝影師！</p>
<p>佈景包天鳴—是有豐富藝術涵養，是一位思想敏捷，忠於工作的天才藝術家。在「花燭之夜」中有不可泯滅的功績，幾座李公館客廳，洞房，郊野等佈景，足以證明他的聰明。</p>
<p>收音顧宗義—是中國電影圈中不易多得的技術人材，用着自製的録音機嘗試了「暴風雨」，成績斐然。於是，「時勢英雄」，「凱歌」，一部進步一部，一劇優良一劇，現時「花燭之夜」已達盡善盡美之境，聲音的淸晰，聲浪的高低，足與舶來品相抗衡，相媲美，而較誰高誰低了。</p>
<h3>杭州「三五劇社」處女公演</h3>
<p>有的朋友說，話劇要想在這個有聲電影已經進展完善的時代裏而想抬起頭來，眞不容易哪！其實講這話的朋友他一定沒有看到已經消逝了的二十四年度的話劇的大活躍。</p>
<p>不消說，話劇與電影是同樣的能够博得觀眾的需要的；正因為他倆是有着截然的不同點呢，要是在藝術的立場上講起來。</p>
<p>富有詩意的西子湖畔，可是恰相反地，劇運倒是安靜得毫無生氣；這並不是杭地人仕對於話劇的興趣淡薄，祇是肯努力於話劇運動的人才太少呵！不過眼前卻有着新的活躍，計先後成立的有「之江劇社」「中國劇社」和新型的「三五劇社」，該社是集杭地著名劇人組織的一個業餘劇社，如前西湖劇社社長黃天和，前南京獅吼劇社主持人劉玉白，前藝海影業公司劇務主任楊霖等，現在他們已選定田漢的劇作「湖上的悲劇」「名優之死」「洪水」…准於二月八日作處女演，與杭地觀眾行見面禮，諒屆時定有新的活躍照遍了西子湖畔。</p>

<p>Beiping: Due to adverse winds, the Changping Maru only entered port in the afternoon of the 12th. Dohihara disembarked at Tanggu from the ship and took the Yu express train to Tianjin at 7:40 PM. Lieutenant Colonel Ishii of the Japanese Garrison in North China, Takeshita, head of the Shanhaiguan Special Service Agency, Wachi, head of the Taiyuan Special Service Agency, and over ten others welcomed him at the East Station. Dohihara got off the train and went to the Changguan residence in the Japanese Concession to await meeting with Ban Gaki. Yin Rugeng secretly arrived in Tianjin from Tongxian by car in the afternoon of the 12th, accompanied by Chi Zongmo, the head of the Puppet Secretariat, to visit Dohihara, Tada, and Ban Gaki. Song Zheyuan decided to come to Tianjin from Beiping with Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun on the morning of the 13th to meet with Dohihara and Ban Gaki for final detailed discussions on the Chahar-Eastern Hebei incidents. The key to the North China situation lies in the outcome of the Tianjin meeting. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Vice Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army Ban Gaki and Chief of Staff of the Japanese Garrison in North China Nagami were still discussing matters with Military Officer Isoya stationed in Shanghai in Qingdao on the 12th. They are scheduled to fly back to Tianjin from Qingdao on the morning of the 13th to participate in the Sino-Japanese consultation in Tianjin. Japanese military officers stationed in China are scheduled to hold another conference on the current situation at the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple at noon on the 13th. Ban Gaki and Nagami will convey the opinions of various military officers in South China, using the issues of Eastern Hebei and Chahar as a basis for deciding on a policy, and then negotiate with us. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Diplomatic negotiations regarding Hebei and Chahar will soon be conducted in Tianjin. Key Japanese figures such as Dohihara and Ban Gaki, because Major General Isoya, the Japanese military officer stationed in Shanghai, had arrived in Qingdao, rushed to Qingdao from Tianjin and Dalian one after another to meet with him. It is anticipated that a discussion on various issues will be held in Qingdao. Dohihara and Ban Gaki will come to Beiping and Tianjin in the next few days. The authorities here are preparing for internal stability and external harmony, and will meet sincerely with Dohihara and others when they arrive in Beiping and Tianjin in order to resolve the current issues. Xiao Zhenying is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow morning, and Zhu plans to go to Tianjin either tomorrow night or the morning after. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Xiao Zhenying changed his plans to go to Tianjin on the 13th, and Song Zheyuan also decided to go that evening. It was decided to thoroughly discuss the issues of Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar with the Japanese side in Tianjin. Therefore, Tianjin has become a place of widespread attention. (Special dispatch from the 12th by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Dohihara arrived at Dagu on the 11th on the Changping Maru. Due to waiting for the tide, there was a delay, and it entered port at noon on the 12th. He then took the Beining train and arrived in Tianjin at 7:25 PM to meet with Tada for discussions. Furthermore, Ban Gaki flew from Tianjin to Qingdao on the 11th to meet with Isoya and returned to Tianjin by plane on the morning of the 12th, and then took a train to Beiping at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. (Special dispatch from the 12th by the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Beiping: The successive visits of the Japanese military officer stationed in Shanghai, Isoya, and the Foreign Affairs Counselor of "Manchukuo," Oohashi, to Jinan have now caused anxiety among the people of Beiping, as they fear that they will threaten Han Fuju to join the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. At the same time, the Japanese responsible party denies the statement in the Chinese newspapers that the Chaoyang incident has been resolved. It is reported that Hase, the captain of the guard of the Japanese Embassy, met with Song Zheyuan yesterday with Imai to discuss the Chaoyangmen incident. Song expressed his apologies for this incident, but Hase reserved the right to make a written request and asked Song to pay attention to the statement in the Chinese newspapers that the Japanese soldiers fired first, saying that this statement was unfounded and would hinder an early resolution. (Special dispatch from the 12th by Reuters)</p>
<h3>Liu Jialuan Arrives in Beiping to Report Everything to Song</h3>
<p>Beiping: Liu Jialuan, Commander of the Tianjin-Dagu Garrison, arrived in Beiping tonight upon being summoned by Song to report everything. Wang Yitang went to Tianjin today and will return to Beiping within a few days. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Headquarters has been postponed due to incomplete preparations. The Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters will be abolished when the headquarters is established, and a new Beiping Security Garrison Command will be established, appointing Zhao Dengyu, commander of the 147th Division of the 29th Army, as commander. The Tianjin-Dagu Security Command will still exist, but its name will be changed, and it will be responsible for security in the Jinghai and Xianshuigu areas of Tianjin. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Song Summons Zhang Zizhong Regarding the Occupation of Shangdu by Puppet Troops and Gives Instructions</h3>

On the 12th, he specifically summoned Zhang Zizhong and gave instructions. Zhang is scheduled to return to Chahar within a few days to handle everything.

<h3>The Eastern Hebei Puppet Organization Stops Intercepting Railway Funds</h3>
<p>Beiping: The matter of the Eastern Hebei puppet organization intercepting funds from the Beining Railway has reportedly been resolved by signing an agreement. The Xin-Yu Section Supervision Office has been declared abolished. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Chen Juesheng, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, said that the interception of railway funds by the puppet Xin-Yu Section has lasted for two months. After strenuous negotiations, the Railway Supervision Office of the puppet organization has stopped working, and this matter will come to an end. The entire issue of Eastern Hebei is being negotiated by those in charge of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and related parties and will soon be resolved. The establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is based on the domestic and international environment, and the difficulties of our country are well known. The spiritual civilization of the East is still worthy of respect, but our technology is far inferior to other countries, which can also lead to destruction. The purpose of the establishment of the council is internally to eliminate communism and alleviate the suffering of the people, and externally to strive for peace in order to coexist. However, it is still in its early stages of establishment and needs to be planned. Given time, it may be possible to achieve success. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to well-informed sources here, as a result of Chen Juesheng's negotiations with related parties, the Xin-Yu Section Management Office of the Beining Railway established by the Eastern Hebei puppet organization has recently ceased its activities, and the deduction of funds has also been stopped.

(Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<h3>Jin-Ji Troops Divide into Three Routes to Encircle and Suppress the Liu Bandit in Laiyuan</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Hebei and Shanxi troops have divided into three routes to encircle and suppress the Liu Guitang bandit gang in Laiyuan: 1. The Li Regiment of the Feng Zhian Division of the 29th Army departed from Zhuoxian and headed towards Wulonggou in Laiyuan, and another part of the regiment was sent to Jinshuikou to attack the bandits from behind; 2.

The encirclement is now complete, and it is difficult for the bandits to escape. After the fall of Laiyuan County, the county magistrate and the chief of public security fled to Lingqiu County with their seals to work. The 279th Regiment of the Feng Zhian Division of the 29th Army, led by Ji Guochang, arrived at the south of Yixian County to block the bandits' escape route. The important pass of Jinshuikou is also guarded by the Yixian local troops to prevent the bandits from intruding. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The situation in Laiyuan County is still chaotic and unclear. Men, women, old, and young are fleeing along the way. Liu Guitang's bandits have appeared in the Wulonggou and Daningzhen areas. Telephone poles have been cut down, making communication impossible. (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>The Nature of County and Township Banks Should be Handled as a Local Cooperative Enterprise</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Some people have suggested to the government to establish county and township banks to regulate rural finance. Kong Xiangxi consulted with Chinese and British financial experts at the last meeting, seeking their opinions. According to an expert, China's rural economy is mostly on the verge of bankruptcy. If county and township banks can be established to provide relief, it is indeed an important plan. However, these banks should not be regarded as commercial in nature, but should be handled as local cooperative enterprises to suit the actual needs of rural areas. (Special dispatch from the 12th by the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Schools from All Over the Country Report to Nanjing One After Another</h3>
<p>Nanjing: School representatives from all over the country have reported to Nanjing one after another.

<h3>The Key to Changes in the International Situation</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Since the end of the European War and the establishment of the League of Nations, the formation of so-called military alliances between countries seems to be something that all countries should be wary of. However, in reality, this is not entirely the case. For example, the military alliance established between France and Poland and Czechoslovakia after the establishment of the Locarno Pact is a military alliance, and the development of the relationship between the Little Entente countries is also of the nature of a military alliance. When Hitler came to power in Germany, France's extensive diplomatic policy did not form a so-called military alliance, but the international group it created would still be the backbone of a military alliance in the event of an emergency. The recent military cooperation measures concluded by the general staffs of Britain and France even more clearly embody the spirit of a military alliance. Therefore, there is little doubt that the conclusion of military alliances will in fact return to the old state before the war.</p>
<p>The initial significance of this Anglo-French military cooperation is to deal with Italy's aggression against Abyssinia and its threat to Britain, and at the same time to prevent Germany's outward development and its threat to France. Therefore, its most direct target is entirely Italy and Germany. Further, it can be said to be a preparatory step to deal with Japan in the Far East. Italy's actions in Abyssinia today are nothing more than following Japan's old trick of invading China. Judging by today's international law, both are so-called illegal actions. After the war, Britain and France often had disagreements, and the world regarded them as not easy to cooperate. Now that they can put aside their old grievances and unanimously try to curb Italy's ambitions, why can't the Anglo-French group be expanded to become an Anglo-American-French-Russian group to jointly deal with international aggressors? This is what we can foresee.</p>
<p>It is still difficult to say what the consequences of the completion of Anglo-French military cooperation will be, but it is possible to speculate that there are only two paths: 1. Italy will take advantage of the situation to change its course and engage in reconciliation. 2. Italy will try to combine with Germany and Japan to form another military group. If reconciliation can be achieved, the European situation may temporarily tend towards stability. However, judging from Mussolini's consistent strong attitude of "either don't do it, or do it thoroughly," it is not impossible for Italy, Germany, and Japan to combine. The reason why Germany and Italy cannot cooperate today is nothing more than the Central European issue. If the two sides can reach an understanding on the Central European issue, then in other aspects, Italy and Germany really have a lot in common. Moreover, the current Anglo-French military cooperation is not only to deal with Italy, but also to deal with Germany. The external conditions for a German-Italian combination are already in place, and it is not difficult to achieve as long as both sides are willing. As far as Japan is concerned, the rumor of a Japanese-German military alliance has been confirmed by Britain, France, and Russia, and its possibility is also very high in terms of reason. In order to reduce the threat from the Soviet Union on its side, Japan must unite with a strong anti-Russian Western country to seek support, and this ideal country is almost certainly Germany. At the same time, in order to expand its territory, Germany must unite with Japan to have the possibility of invading Russia. If Japan and Germany can form an alliance and cooperate, then there should be no difficulty for Japan and Italy to cooperate. As long as Mussolini is interested in uniting with Japan, Japan should not find it difficult to bring him into the fold. However, judging from the current situation, Italy is slightly softened under the situation of Anglo-French military cooperation, and its intention is still to reconcile. However, if Italy is unable to reconcile and ends up forming a united front with Germany and Japan, then the international situation will inevitably change greatly, thereby promoting a major alliance of Britain, America, France, and Russia, which should also be expected. What attitude will our country take towards the arrival of this kind of international situation? This is something that we should deeply consider.</p>

<h3>Instructions Issued from Tokyo; Naval Conference Likely to Break Down; Insistence on Quantitative Restrictions; Otherwise, Withdraw from the Conference and Send Observers; Philip to Return to America Soon to Report on the Conference's Progress; British Military Experts Draft Defense Plan for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Tokyo The Japanese government's instructions have been passed by the entire cabinet and telegraphed by Foreign Minister Hirota to Plenipotentiary Nagano. The instructions consist of four articles, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  Efforts must be made to ensure the smooth progress of the conference in order to achieve the establishment of a comprehensive agreement.</p>
<p>2.  When attending the first committee meeting to be held on the 14th, the focus should still be on the abolition or reduction of offensive weapons such as aircraft carriers, and the fundamental position of Japan must be clearly explained again. If a quantitative restriction agreement cannot be established, the thorough disarmament policy proposed by Japan must also be recognized by the other countries.</p>
<p>3.  At the first committee on the 14th, the disarmament plan of both quantity and quality proposed by Japan must be explained. If the basic method of future discussions cannot accommodate the Japanese proposal and a notification case is decided upon, it is not allowed to participate in the deliberation. At that time, the form of withdrawal from the conference should be adopted, and only observers should remain in attendance. There is no objection.</p>
<p>4.  If there is no hope of establishing a substantive disarmament limitation agreement between the five countries, preparations should still be made to conclude agreements on issues that can be achieved.</p>
<p>The Japanese side is currently advocating the following restrictions in the treaty: 1. Restricting the use of submarines. 2. (A) Restricting the arming of merchant ships (London Treaty Article 14). (B) Provisions for the disposal of warships (London Treaty Article 18). 3. A joint declaration by the five countries on self-restraint in shipbuilding. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo According to Japanese sources, the first committee of the London Naval Disarmament Conference is scheduled to reopen on the 13th of this month, and it is planned to submit the common maximum disarmament plan of Japan for discussion again. However, the US representative still takes an extremely tough attitude, saying that there is no room for further discussion on the Japanese proposal, and other representatives of Britain, France, Italy and other countries also intend to reject the Japanese proposal. However, because the Japanese side has not yet received instructions from its home country, it proposed to postpone the reopening by one day, that is, it will be reopened on the 14th. According to observations in Tokyo, the Japanese proposal is determined to be an absolute majority of four to one, and the naval disarmament conference will collapse as a result. It is said that the Japanese representative has decided to issue a statement of breakdown and will withdraw from the disarmament conference. (China United News Agency dispatch on the 12th) The British government authorities intend to expect the Japanese representative to withdraw smoothly before the breakdown of the disarmament conference, and are earnestly mediating between the representatives of Japan and the United States. Among them, Councilor Kelegie secretly met with Davis, the chief plenipotentiary representative of the United States, on the 10th, and urged the meeting to give the Japanese representative the opportunity to speak in order to avoid disputes and bid farewell smoothly. On the one hand, Kelegie requested the Japanese delegation to send observers. It can be seen that the final procedure of the collapse of the conference will have some changes due to the Japanese government's dispatch of observers. This is also unknown. (Allied News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo All newspapers in Tokyo published editorials criticizing the crisis of the London Naval Conference, predicting that in tomorrow's meeting, Japan's request will be rejected after continued explanation, and the cabinet will order the Japanese representative, Nagano, to withdraw from the meeting and leave an observer to attend the future four-nation conference. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun paid attention to the major representatives of Britain and Japan on Thursday's meeting to try to save the breakdown of the Naval Conference, saying that the chairman of the Naval Conference, British Foreign Secretary Eden, declared after Nagano explained everything, that he was well aware of Japan's reasons for not being able to compromise. If the conference unfortunately breaks down, Britain will still be Japan's close friend. Eden also expressed his willingness that the two countries not forget their past friendship and continue to cooperate. (Reuters dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington Secretary of State Hull declared at the press conference today that Under Secretary of State Philip, one of the US representatives attending the London Naval Conference, is scheduled to return to the country on Thursday. This move is based on Philip's own intention to stay in London for only a few weeks and then return to the country to report the situation of the Naval Conference to the government. Therefore, Philip's return to the country has nothing to do with the situation of the breakdown of the Naval Conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Singapore It is reported that naval, land and air force experts have drafted a plan, which will be implemented in Hong Kong if the London Naval Conference fails. Admiral Traner, commander of the Chinese fleet, is scheduled to start his journey to London on the 17th of this month to report this plan to the Imperial Defense Committee. According to the provisions of the Washington Treaty, Hong Kong is prohibited from being fortified. (National Telegraph on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Japan's Instructions; Result of Consultation Between the Foreign Ministry and the Navy</h3>
<p>Tokyo The consultation meeting between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy to discuss and decide on the important instructions to Nagano was held at the Eurasian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2 pm on the 11th. Togo, Director of the Eurasian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kato, Chief of the Disarmament Section, and Toyota, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Navy, Oka, Chief of the Disarmament Section, and others attended. Based on the request for instructions from Plenipotentiary Nagano, the discussion lasted for four hours. In the end, it was believed that even if there was no other good strategy besides the breakdown, efforts must be made to follow the fundamental policy. On this point, the opinions were consistent. The meeting was temporarily adjourned at 7 pm, and the cadres of the Navy gathered at the official residence of the Minister of the Navy to summarize their opinions. The meeting was resumed at 10:30 pm and continued until 12:30 am on the 12th, gradually forming the original plan of the Navy. The general situation of the Navy's plan is recorded below: 1. The Japanese government wholeheartedly hopes to achieve a complete agreement that includes all participating countries, and expects it to continue to exercise thorough deliberations. 2. Therefore, Japan's proposed common maximum limit is to establish this policy as the center and proceed with the meeting, in order to achieve thorough disarmament and implement a state of non-threat and non-aggression. Therefore, efforts will continue to be made at the meeting, hoping to restore the discussion of the quantitative restriction issue and introduce it into the right track. If the discussion of the quantitative issue is cut off, Japan must also follow the established policy, and will not participate in the deliberation of any other proposals that have nothing to do with the quantitative restriction. 3. However, in view of the fact that this meeting was convened to contribute to world peace and possess a noble spirit, efforts should be made to avoid the situation of collapse. In view of the general situation in the future, it is hoped that a way will be found to deal with it properly. 4. It is quite regrettable that the quantitative restriction issue of our fundamental proposition, or the abolition of offensive weapons such as battleships and aircraft carriers, has not yet been given a full opportunity to explain. Efforts must still be made to fully explain it in the future. 5. If, after several deliberations, a mutual understanding cannot be reached between the countries concerned, and other countries propose to establish an agreement plan on the restriction of the use of submarines and other matters that are considered to have the possibility of being established between the countries concerned, we should not hesitate to cooperate with them. 6. If, due to the attitude of other countries, we are in a position where we have to withdraw from the meeting anyway, we must attend as observers at the request of the countries concerned, and it seems that we do not need to refuse, etc.</p>
<p>The above instructions were decided by the temporary cabinet meeting on the 12th, and Foreign Minister Hirota immediately issued the above instructions to Plenipotentiary Nagano, so that he could handle all the procedures for the breakdown of the situation.

<p>Moscow: People's Committee Chairman Molotov gave a speech on Soviet foreign policy, stating, "In the past year, the Soviet Union's relations with other countries have generally developed normally. In numerous instances, Soviet foreign relations have developed in the direction of upholding peace. In any case, the Soviet Union has fulfilled its responsibility to consolidate world peace and to consolidate peace in Europe and Asia." (Applause) "It is now necessary to elaborate on the Soviet Union's relations with various countries. Compared to the Seventh Soviet Congress, there has been no fundamental change. I will briefly describe some important events. Regarding the Soviet Union's foreign policy, we have a clear example to offer concerning relations with neighboring countries. Our western, southern, and eastern borders total 20,000 kilometers in length, bordering several large, medium, and small countries. However, their friendly attitude towards the Soviet Union cannot all be as sincere as that of Turkey." (Applause) "None of these countries has felt aggression from the Soviet Union during this period. On the contrary, even the smallest countries often have their policies coerced by the anti-Soviet forces of major imperialist powers. However, they have no reason to express concern about their relations with the Soviet Union. However, it is necessary to specifically mention our Far Eastern border, where a special situation has been created due to Japan's occupation of Manchuria."</p>
<p>Relationship with Europe</p>
<p>"In order to preserve peace in Europe, the Soviet Union concluded a very important so-called Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact with countries such as France and Czechoslovakia. According to France's proposal, in addition to the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania should also be invited to sign the treaty. However, due to Germany and Poland's successive refusals, the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact was not completed. Fortunately, this did not prevent the signing of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty last May. When the current French Prime Minister Laval came to Moscow, the common desire of the Soviet Union and France was confirmed. This desire is to promote a local Eastern European pact that includes non-signatory countries, including mutual non-aggression, mutual consultation, and non-assistance to aggressors. Subsequently, the Soviet-Czech Mutual Assistance Pact was successively signed. Soviet and Czech representatives declared that they regarded the Franco-Soviet and Soviet-Czech pacts as only a partial realization of the policy of preserving peace in Eastern Europe. Czech President Dr. Beneš, in his famous report on the Moscow talks, pointed out that the representatives of the two countries are now particularly concerned with "the genuine realization of a universal collective organization to achieve security guarantees on an indivisible basis of peace." The Soviet government supports this policy. I will reiterate British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Moscow. The significance of this trip can be seen in one thing, namely, that the talks between Soviet representatives and Eden created "no conflict of interest on any major issues of current diplomatic policy between the two countries." This conclusion means that the preconditions for continuing to promote British-Soviet relations now exist."</p>
<p>Relationship with the United States</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union's relations with the United States are developing normally, allowing for commercial and economic aspects. At the same time, we cannot remain silent about the repeated attempts by some American newspapers to incite anti-Soviet war. These newspapers represent reactionary groups inclined towards fascism, and their purpose is to undermine the friendly policy between the Soviet Union and the United States. This policy is of great significance for maintaining world peace."</p>
<p>Severance of Relations with Uruguay</p>
<p>"Last year, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with Belgium, Luxembourg, and Colombia. However, on the other hand, the Uruguayan government, under pressure from Brazil (and allegedly pressure from some reactionary groups in Europe), severed relations with the Soviet Union. If one believes Uruguay's announcement, one would think that the Soviet Union's mission is to interfere in the internal affairs of Brazil and Uruguay." (Laughter, applause) "However, if the rulers of Brazil and Uruguay want to blame others, they know too little. If you have read Beteni's ("Political Rogue," a well-known Soviet political commentator) essay, there is no need to say more about Uruguay's announcement, because this article has explained in detail the connection between the Uruguayan incident and the Uruguayan cheese issue." (Applause and laughter) "However, the Soviet government cannot easily let go of Uruguay's actions, because it has not only no reason to do so but has directly violated the covenant of the League of Nations, and the Soviet Union and Uruguay are both allied countries. Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Committee has accused the Uruguayan government of violating the covenant of the League of Nations by not first submitting the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration for mediation before abruptly severing diplomatic relations."</p>
<p>Relationship with Germany</p>
<p>"I will reiterate the relationship with Germany and Japan. For various reasons, this has received special attention from the working masses of our country. First, let's talk about Germany. I will frankly say that the Soviet government is willing to establish better relations with Germany. From the perspective of the interests of the people of both countries, this is completely beneficial. However, the realization of this policy cannot rely solely on our country, but also on the German government. What is the essence of the foreign policy of the current German government? I stated the main trends of its foreign policy in the Seventh Soviet Congress, quoting Hitler's book "Mein Kampf." This book has sold millions of copies in Germany. In this book, Hitler directly stated the necessity of a "policy of territorial conquest." At the same time, Mr. Hitler directly said, "What I now call the new country in Europe refers to Russia and its border states." Since I read Hitler's book at the Soviet Congress, the German government has not acknowledged these plans and conquests, which is to explain the response decided at the joint naval and foreign affairs meeting on the 11th. All senators had no objection and generally acknowledged it. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM (Alliance News Agency, 12th). But in its silence, it completely proves Hitler's above-mentioned views. This is not surprising, as everyone knows that the National Socialist Party's newspapers are eager to advance their various preparation plans in this direction, though not only that. This kind of sinful propaganda of seizing the territory of other countries has found new partners abroad. Various spokespersons for German capital have appeared in its neighboring country, Poland, such as Mr. Stettenitzki and the ignorant gentlemen of the Krakow newspaper, who are wantonly barking and openly advocating the seizure of a part of Soviet territory, and their weird followers are also repeatedly making such dreams." (Laughter, applause) "Some people in our neighboring country Finland also occasionally make similar absurd remarks in response to the most aggressively ambitious imperialist countries."</p>
<p>"Everyone knows that German Fascists are not only working on aggressive plans but also intend to implement them in the near future. Everyone knows that the German Fascists have turned Germany under their control into a barracks, and because it is located in Central Europe, it not only threatens the Soviet Union. To mention another example, take Czechoslovakia, which does not threaten any neighboring country and is busy with peaceful construction but has been covered by the cloud of German Fascism. But seeing soldiers' bayonets, machine guns, newly invented poisonous gases and chemical weapons, and high-speed silent military aircraft, turning border soldiers' wars into unpredictable massacres of peaceful people, even women and children, all this is enough to endanger peace and is not limited to Europe. How contradictory the situation in Germany is now can be seen in the following: On the one hand, it is pursuing its anti-Soviet foreign policy, but a certain part of its ruling group accepted the German government's proposal and signed an agreement with the Soviet Union on September 4, 1935, granting a credit loan of 200 million marks for a period of five years. We have successfully accepted this loan, as well as the Czech Republic's 250 million crown five-year credit loan last year. In the past few months, representatives of the German government have also proposed to us another larger amount of ten-year loans. Although we are not eager for foreign loans and have already changed from the past, beginning to use cash to purchase goods from abroad in large quantities, we will never refuse to discuss such commercial proposals from the German government. Developing foreign trade and economic relations is not subject to the influence of this or that political force, which is in line with Soviet policy. I believe this is also in line with the interests of the German people. This makes the German government see it in practice."</p>
<p>Relationship with Japan</p>
<p>"Finally, I will elaborate on the relationship with Japan. The Soviet Union concluded an agreement to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway, thereby expressing its peace and concession. The agreement to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway was signed last March, and the railway has been transferred to the Japanese "Manchukuo" authorities. Payments for the Chinese Eastern Railway and purchases of goods from Japan "Manchukuo" are also proceeding normally. Regarding other practical issues, the Soviet Union has always tried to seek understanding with Japan. However, the main issue between the Soviet Union and Japan remains unresolved. Japan has so far avoided concluding a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact that we proposed three years ago. This kind of action cannot be without suspicion. On the other hand, the various attempts by the Japanese "Manchukuo" army to invade the Soviet border have not stopped or diminished. I will only mention one thing, that on December 10, fifty Japanese "Manchukuo" soldiers invaded Soviet territory more than one or two kilometers in Novoyalekseyevka, and fired guns and machine guns at our border guards, resulting in the death of four border soldiers and the captain Kotenikov, and two others were injured. They were later repulsed and suffered considerable losses, and they retreated back into Manchuria. But the provocative nature of this action does not need to be explained. This is another fact committed by representatives of the Japanese government, which can never be regarded as exceeding normal relations. Our ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, proposed organizing a Soviet-Japanese "Manchukuo" border commission to investigate and eliminate border disputes for nearly half a year, but so far, the Japanese government has not responded to this proposal. It is said that some groups in the Japanese military need Soviet border disputes to divert the world's attention from Japan's annexation of Manchuria and its expansion to North China and the entire China. This kind of border conflict is also needed by some people in Japan to show the world the "firmness" and "strength" of Japanese policy. This is extremely clear. The Japanese army's firing on our Far Eastern border has not stopped, and the Japanese military is also invading our border, just as it is invading the territory of other countries."</p>
<p>Japanese-German Alliance</p>
<p>Mr. Molotov continued, "Recently, it has been claimed that Japan, Germany, and Poland will sign a military agreement. This is not surprising. It was not without reason that Japan and Germany previously seized the opportunity to withdraw from the League of Nations. They want to indulge in aggression. Judging from their foreign policies, they are indeed the most aggressive powers in the world. The German Fascist authorities have always concealed their plan to annex the Soviet Union with the excuse that the Soviet Union and Germany are not adjacent. However, we all know that Germany, with the encouragement of other countries, is fighting for superiority in the Baltic Sea and maintaining a special relationship with Poland (which has a very long border with the Soviet Union)."</p>
<p>Consolidating National Defense</p>
<p>"Therefore, our country must establish a necessary and high degree of national defense on both the eastern and western borders." (Applause) "For several years, we have made extremely large deployments in this regard. However, if we consider defending our peaceful working people and collective farmers, preventing foreign aggression from succeeding in our country, and protecting our victories and great socialist construction, then we are still not satisfied with our national defense facilities." (Applause) "We must provide all necessary material conditions to engage in this. Therefore, we must greatly expand the national defense budget this year." (Applause. At this time, Stalin approached the presidium table, and the audience cheered enthusiastically and stood up to cheer.) "We already have a strong Workers' and Peasants' Red Army." (Applause) "We must resolutely strive to ensure that all parts of our army have loyal and skilled soldiers, aviators, artillerymen, chemists, tank drivers, and marksmen." (Applause) "We have already signed and granted ranks and titles to the Red Army's command personnel, strengthening the importance of the Red Army's leading cadres." (Applause) "Only this kind of Red Army can faithfully strive for peace, for the Soviet Union's national defense, and for socialism." (Applause) "We must continue to strengthen our country's Red Army and, at the same time, must use all possible means to preserve peace and explain to the working masses of the world the principles and special paths of our country's international peace policy."</p>
<p>Italian-Abyssinian Issue</p>
<p>"Our country's entry into the League of Nations does not mean that the Soviet Union's foreign policy and the capitalist countries are no longer fundamentally different in principle. Let us take the Italian-Abyssinian War as an example to know the opposite. The Italian-Abyssinian War is a typical imperialist war to seize colonies. Italian fascism openly defends its policy of occupying Abyssinia and turning Abyssinia into its colony. After the World War, the major imperialist powers carried out a division of colonies. Italy believed that this division was not fair to it, so it wanted to launch a new war, make a big fuss, and sacrifice Abyssinia to satisfy its desire to expand colonies. The current actions of Fascist Italy are clearly the vanguard of a partial redivision of the world. However, today's world is pregnant with huge events and greatly shocks the European capitalist rulers. The Fascist government has demanded that other imperialists and the entire League of Nations support its aggressive colonial actions. The truth of all countries' policies is completely exposed in their relations with the Italian-Abyssinian War. Let us speak of great powers, from the surface point of view, the policies of the great powers to seize colonies "seems to be insincere in principle, but in reality it is not. The attitude of the various capitalist countries participating in the League of Nations is clearly different, but this difference does not mean that there is any difference in principle in their policies of seizing colonies. The reason for this difference lies in the different degrees of concern among countries about the increase in Italy's imperialist power. The same is true for non-League members. Among the capitalist powers, none regard the independence of weak countries as more important than their selfish attempt to participate in the division of colonies. Only the Soviet Union holds its unique attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian War. In principle, it is completely different from any imperialism and any policy of seizing colonies. Only the Soviet Union can clearly tell the world that it respects the principles of equality and independence for Abyssinia, a member of the League of Nations. It does not participate in or assist in the actions of the League of Nations and any capitalist countries to undermine its independence and equality. The Soviet Union's policy is fundamentally different in principle from other members of the League of Nations. It has great international significance and has important results."</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union has shown to the League of Nations in the example of a small country, Abyssinia, that it is loyal to the principles of the independence of all countries and the equality of the rights of all nations. The Soviet Union has also used its entry into the League of Nations to implement its policy towards imperialist aggressor countries. The first year of the Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations has fully proved the correctness of our decision to join the League of Nations. The League of Nations is ultimately an organization of capitalist countries, and there are various shortcomings in it. However, to some extent, the League of Nations has a restraining effect on warmongers and aggressor countries. The League of Nations should be criticized because it has not made every effort to complete its tasks. As for the Italian-Abyssinian War, the League of Nations expressed its later opinions to the aggressor country. We must admit that the League of Nations has not tried to stop the war. We cannot ignore here that the League of Nations in this incident was not dominated by peace-loving people but was dominated by countries that aided the aggressor country. In this case, we should mention that the Soviet Union has participated in the League of Nations' resolutions on the Italian-Abyssinian War, especially the resolutions on economic sanctions against Italy (which the League of Nations recognizes as an aggressor country)."</p>
<p>Impending War</p>
<p>The Italian-Abyssinian War shows that the world's war crisis is increasing and increasingly encompassing the entire Europe. The war has just begun, and we have no way of predicting how it will stop or when it will stop. However, anyone knows that Italian fascism has invested a lot of capital in this incident. The Italian rulers want to consolidate their power, believing that the only way is to fight for new colonies and risk war, not to improve domestic economy and culture. This fact is self-evident. Today, the various capitalist countries are, to some extent, emerging from the economic panic of recent years at a very unbalanced pace. However, even today, they themselves do not believe that their strength can be increased by the development of domestic strength. Here, we can understand what imperialism's heavy desire to conquer colonies is for. The profound reason for the Italian-Abyssinian War also lies here. Japan, Germany, and Italy, they have either already started or will start tomorrow, launching a new struggle among capitalist countries around the world. No country in the world will not be affected by this action and the establishment of the above-mentioned three countries' active foreign policy.</p>
<p>Ideological Struggle</p>
<p>"In this international situation, the Soviet Union bears a particularly heavy responsibility. Those countries that are dragged into a new imperialist war may have their necks cut off before they can realize their plans of annexation." (Applause) "The imperialists' underestimation of the passive action of the masses may unexpectedly become a miscalculation. There is a precedent for this. We Bolsheviks can easily understand the rise of the masses. We deeply know that the aggressive plans of all kinds of imperialists, especially the plans of imperialist fascists, have nothing to do with the masses. However, in order to complete our task, the working masses of the Soviet Union must assess their own strength and the national defense of our motherland, especially the strength of our Red Army." (Applause) "We will try our best to re-temporarily prevent the possibility of imperialists attacking us. Although if they attack today, our Red Army will undoubtedly give them a head-on blow." (Applause) "The Russian working class has previously joined hands with the revolutionary peasants to overthrow the landlords and capitalists and help liberate the various peoples of Tsarist Russia. Today, the working masses of our Soviet Socialist Republics Union are working together to build a new life and moving towards a happy life. However, even today, there are still imperialist gentlemen who vainly attempt to restrain our Soviet Union's liberated nations with force and make them succumb to foreign landlords and capitalists. We dare to say to them, good gentlemen, please open your eyes and take a look. You were born too late." (Thunderous applause, lasting for a long time)</p>
<p>Active Construction</p>
<p>Molotov continued, "We were indeed very difficult when the various countries militarily intervened. They were extremely weak, hungry, and had no time to breathe. However, even at that time, the imperialists' plan to destroy our country was completely shattered. Since then, our country has undergone drastic changes. Our economy is no longer like it was ten or nineteen years ago. The technology of the various important industrial departments has been transformed by new people. These people have grown up on a new foundation. They have been able to control technology and, with the example of 維斯泰哈諾夫, rapidly increase the productivity of socialist labor. Since then, our country's most backward department (namely, the countryside) has been completely transformed. The development of collective farms and the final elimination of the capitalist class (rich peasants) have enabled our country to eliminate classes. The remnants of the rural bourgeoisie are still small parasites, clinging particularly tightly. After they are eliminated, all of our country's income will belong to the workers and the country. People's lives have been greatly improved, and the door to a happy and cultural life has been opened to the people of the whole country. We are now able to enjoy the initial fruits of victory. The unprecedented development of the Soviet Union's material welfare and culture is waiting for us. However, at this moment, those gentlemen, with their blind hatred of the new world, are trying to occupy and disintegrate the Soviet Union. Then how do we answer this question, that we appeared in the world without the consent of those gentlemen, and against their wishes?" (Laughter, applause) "This means that the old world must be swept away to await the birth of the new world. The time has come." (Loud cheers) (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Department Will Explain the Entire Picture of its China Policy at the Parliamentary Session</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Army intends to submit and clarify various important issues related to it, which are currently the basis of foreign policy, namely, the implementation of the China policy, at the parliamentary session. Regarding the above-mentioned issues, although the Army is in a guiding position, it still implements national policies based on the policies decided by the consultation of various related ministries such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Army, and the Ministry of Finance. Both the central government and the local government unanimously advocate the establishment of peace in East Asia and move towards genuine friendship and cooperation between Japan and China. At the same time, regarding the North China issue that has attracted worldwide attention, the Army will do its utmost to ensure the security of North China in the border area, which is the fundamental national policy, namely, the development of "Manchukuo," and to promote the happiness of the local residents. This should be the main goal. Therefore, it should also adopt a supportive position towards the "popular automatic" movement. The above-mentioned policies will be clarified one by one, and in order to achieve the implementation of this policy, it is hoped that the people will unite and provide assistance. Economic and technical aspects all need to cooperate together. If it is deemed necessary as a result, or the relevant parties collect and investigate to serve as reference materials, it will be helpful in arousing public opinion. (Alliance News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>Italian-Abyssinian Issue: The League of Nations Lacks Good Strategies for Mediation; The Legislative Significance of the United States and China Awaits Explanation; Italy's Attitude Shows Signs of Change</h3>
<p>Geneva: Italy's attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian War has recently shown signs of change. There is now reason to believe that any practical peace proposals submitted today will be treated differently in Rome than they were a few weeks ago. However, it is difficult to decide who will propose it. Britain and France may not want to do it, and Italy cannot do it. Abyssinia is unwilling to do it. The League of Nations is a mediating body, but there are no good strategies on how to make it work. The League of Nations Executive Council meeting on January 20 may raise the issue of reconciliation, but most members do not agree with Italy's actions, so it seems that they will advocate expanding sanctions against Italy instead of putting forward a peace treaty. The United States has been asked to explain the scope of the legislative order, because this law may have an impact on the actions of the League of Nations Executive Council. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: The "Sunday Referee" newspaper said today that at 4:00 AM on October 17 last year, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, at the request of French Prime Minister Laval to propose the final peace terms, replied to Mr. Laval with an ultimatum, saying that if Britain did not find a way to dismiss the concentration of the Mediterranean fleet within 24 hours, Italy would attack the 17 British ships stationed in Alexandria Bay at that time. The next day, the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, met with Mr. Mussolini and agreed that Italy would first withdraw one division of the Italian army from Libya, and then Britain would transfer its resident fleet in the Mediterranean elsewhere.

<h3>US Amends Neutrality Law; Little Difference from Original Proposal</h3>
<p>Washington – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee met yesterday to discuss the new Neutrality Law. With the consent of Secretary of State Hull, a clause in the original bill prohibiting the shipment of certain goods to belligerent nations was deleted and replaced with a new clause. Hull told reporters that while the wording of the bill had been amended, the general meaning remained unchanged. The deleted clause originally stated, "If the President believes that the shipment of various goods usable in war to belligerent nations would prolong the conflict, he should prohibit their export." The amended clause now reads, "If the President believes that prohibiting the export of such war-related goods would enhance the power to safeguard the neutrality of the United States, protect the lives of the American people, and maintain American commerce, then he shall have the authority to order an embargo."

<h3>Europe's Largest Steel Plant to be Built in Norway; German and American Steel Plants Collaborate; Annual Output of 30,000 Tons of Special Steel</h3>
<p>Berlin – Representatives from the Essen-based Krupp Steel Works recently negotiated with American steel plants and representatives from the Norwegian Rallvik Electric Steel Plant to establish Europe's largest steel plant in Norway. The plant will use electric arc furnaces to refine special steel. Krupp has a long-standing relationship with the Rallvik plant. This cooperation is likely a continuation of established policy. Krupp will contribute its patented special steel manufacturing methods for the new plant's use. A portion of the output will be purchased by Krupp. The new plant is expected to produce 30,000 tons of special steel annually, using raw materials sourced from Scandinavian countries, including various special ores and fluxes.

<h3>Captured Italian Officer Recounts Fierce Battle in Shire Region; Albanian Strategy Lures Enemy into Deep Mountains; Only 100 Out of Over 1,000 Italian Soldiers Survive</h3>
<p>Albanian Capital – On December 15th last year, Albanian Commander General Ayalla defeated Italian forces in the Shire region of the northern front, retaking Antelessa and Techhan, and capturing seven Italian white soldiers. These prisoners have been transferred to Durazzo. They recounted the events of the battle, stating that on that day, an Italian column of 1,600 men, composed equally of white soldiers and Askari native troops, was ordered to advance south towards Antelessa when they encountered an Albanian unit. The Albanian unit retreated without a fight, and the Italian forces, led by tanks, pursued them. Unbeknownst to the Italians, the Albanians lured them into a deep, mountainous ravine surrounded on three sides by mountains with a single exit. Once the entire Italian force had entered, the Albanians blocked the exit with large stones. The ambushers on the surrounding high ground attacked from above. Realizing they had been tricked, the Italians attempted to break through the encirclement, but the last tank suddenly broke down and blocked the exit. Another tank was hit and caught fire. Most of the soldiers were killed on the spot by the Albanians. Those who engaged in hand-to-hand combat were also almost entirely annihilated. Only about 100 soldiers managed to escape. The seven captured soldiers were spared because they were inside the tanks and could not escape. They report that they have been treated well since their capture and have not been subjected to amputations or other atrocities. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Berlin Denies Supplying Oil to Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin – Foreign reports suggested that the Italian government, anticipating a League of Nations oil embargo, had ordered large quantities of oil from Germany. Well-informed sources here deny this report, stating that Germany's oil production is barely sufficient to meet domestic consumption. The only oil exported is lubricating oil, valued at 1,200,000 marks in 1934 and 2,000,000 marks in the first nine months of 1935. Italy received only a small fraction of this. Furthermore, to protect the domestic oil market, the German government issued an order on November 9th of last year prohibiting the export of oil, making the Italian order unlikely.

<h3>International Labor Bureau Releases Opium Survey Report; Chinese Workers in the Far East Most Severely Affected; Urges Measures to Improve Living Conditions</h3>
<p>Geneva – The International Labor Bureau has released a report addressing the following two issues: The harmful effects of opium use on workers in the Far East; The relationship between opium use and working conditions and living situations. The survey covered the following locations: Burma, the Malay Archipelago, British North Borneo, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, French Indochina, the Kwangchow Bay Leased Territory, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, the South Manchuria Railway Zone, the Kwantung Leased Territory, and southern Korea. Mainland China was not included in the survey. The report details the following facts: Chinese workers are the most numerous opium users in the surveyed locations. However, addiction is more common among Chinese workers who have recently immigrated and indigenous workers who have frequent contact with Chinese, and less common among Chinese workers born in the immigrated locations. Opium use reduces work capacity and efficiency. Some workers in strenuous jobs use opium to support themselves, but they cannot sustain this for long. According to the survey, the reasons for opium use among workers are: Living conditions and natural social environment are not conducive. Separation from family. Working in remote areas. Lack of other forms of recreation. Therefore, the International Labor Bureau concludes: "If working conditions for these workers can be improved, the opium problem will lose much of its severity. The major improvements are: Reduce working hours in manual labor jobs to within the limits of normal human physical capacity. Improve medical facilities to treat workers' illnesses. Adjust wages to match work performed, so that workers' living standards meet their normal needs. Provide workers with various amenities to allow them to bring their families with them when work requires them to live far from home. Organize more recreational activities so that workers do not go astray in their leisure time." (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Hauptmann, Convicted in Lindbergh Kidnapping, Fails to Escape Execution; Execution by Electric Chair on the 17th</h3>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey – Bruno Hauptmann, convicted of kidnapping and killing the Lindbergh baby, is scheduled to be executed in the electric chair on January 17th. Hauptmann appealed to the New Jersey Board of Pardons for a reprieve, but the board rejected the appeal after one hour and five minutes of deliberation. The court officials and those involved in the appeal are forbidden to disclose the details of the court proceedings. Hauptmann is still trying other avenues to save his life. Meanwhile, Governor Hoffman has ordered the detention of Dr. Condon, who left for Panama yesterday and served as an intermediary between the kidnapper and Lindbergh. This is because Condon published an article in a magazine detailing the Hauptmann case and claiming that there were other accomplices. The authorities want to inquire about everything from Condon.

<h3>Prisoners Break Out of Wuwei Jail; Run Rampant, Attacking Everyone; Over Ten Killed, Many Captured</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence – Wuwei County in Anhui Province, north of the Yangtze River, is just across the river from Wuhu and is under the jurisdiction of the Wuhu and Wuwei Joint County Administrative Office. Since the opening of the Wuhu-Wuwei highway to automobile traffic on January 1st of this year, transportation has become more convenient. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, about a hundred prisoners incarcerated in the Wuwei County government jail suddenly broke out, taking advantage of a slight lapse in security. The county jail is old and dilapidated. After escaping, the prisoners seized weapons and attacked everyone they encountered, destroying everything in their path. Chaos erupted. People were panicked. Shops and residences closed their doors. County Magistrate Dai Duanfu, taken by surprise, immediately mobilized the entire security force in the city to maintain order and capture the escapees. The escapees, many of whom were desperate criminals, resisted arrest. The police immediately opened fire. After an hour, order was restored. Over ten escapees were killed on the spot, and many were captured. The County Magistrate reported the incident to the Provincial Government and the Special Commissioner's Office here and issued a public notice to reassure the people. Local order has gradually been restored. (11th)</p>

<h3>The Mystery of British Naval Reconstruction</h3>
<p>The world's major powers, aware of the crisis of a second world war, are rushing to make military preparations. New military equipment, such as air forces and mechanized corps, are being developed in many ways. However, the major powers still regard the longer-established navy as an important part of border defense. Therefore, on the one hand, they are promoting peace and doing their best to form alliances, and on the other hand, they are plotting against each other and making preparations. In the British Empire, the mainland is an island nation, and the colonies are all over the world. It has always been known for its naval power. To cope with the overall situation, it must strive to be the first. Recently, during the general election period, the ministers of various departments declared their ambitions to the people. The most amazing thing is that they resolutely disregard everything and decide to rebuild most of the navy. However, as it involves military secrets, the construction cost and the exact amount are unknown to the outside world. It is only known that the goal is 100 million gold pounds. Therefore, speculations abound. All aspects of how to rebuild, how many ships, how many tons, when to start, how to allocate the expenses, etc., have become the mystery of the British naval reconstruction.</p>
<p>The reporter had nothing to do during the voyage to the West. After reading European newspapers, I chatted with British passengers and finally learned something about the general situation. I will briefly describe the main points for the people of the country.</p>
<p>Military expert H.C. Ferraby said, "British naval reconstruction has been announced to the world by the cabinet and there is no denying it. The so-called reconstruction is not about expanding armaments, nor is it intended to compete with the powers in naval power. It is nothing more than replacing old ships with new ones, so that there is no major difference in their national defense combat capabilities compared with the major naval powers." But what is the use of the old ships and how to achieve the so-called goal of no major difference, Mr. Fei had no way to guess. Mr. Fei also said, "In short, what we demand is to operate within the Washington Treaty signed by the five powers in 1921 and the London Treaty expanded in 1930. We have now learned that within the next few years, we need to replace 13 battleships, 36 cruisers, 53 destroyers, and 28 submarines. Although the number of cruisers may be reduced during the arms limitation conference next month, this point is still questionable and can be ignored. In the opinion of general naval officers, the number of destroyers to be replaced should actually be increased. The number of ships exceeding the construction time limit is actually 118."</p>
<p>"Let us try to study the London Treaty of 1930. We can know that the British Navy cannot replace all of them in order to meet the rated tonnage. Now, only the above four types of ships are used to calculate the total cost of warship construction tonnage, and the total cost is 154,506,600 gold pounds.</p>
<p>"Battleships account for half of this huge total. Although the cost per ton is small, its tonnage is very large. Therefore, the British government agreed to the Ministry of the Navy's proposal eight years ago to study the problem of reducing the tonnage of battleships in order to achieve a result that surpasses the powers. In theory, 25,000 tons is the most suitable, while the 35,000 tons stipulated in the 1921 Washington Treaty is too large. If we can reduce the size according to the new system of 25,000 tons, we can save 2,000,000 gold pounds for each battleship, which is really cost-effective. However, the United States, based on its own environmental calculations, insists on 35,000 tons, (In fact, from the British perspective, this tonnage is still too small.) Its new budget has been carried out according to this number, so our naval reconstruction will also not be willing to lag behind, and this standard tonnage should be used as the basis for valuation.</p>
<p>"The cost per ton has no fixed limit in various countries in the world. In the United Kingdom, the lowest is 176 pounds per ton, and in Germany it can reach a high value of 400 pounds per ton. The cost per ton of the giant ships built 20 years ago, such as the Nelson and Rodney, is higher now than in the past. But for the convenience of calculation, we can estimate the cost per ton of these 13 battleships at 176 pounds. Then 13 times 35,000 times 176 can be known that the total cost is 80,080,000 gold pounds.</p>
<p>"New cruisers should be divided into three categories according to their different uses. 12 ships of 9,000 tons each, at 214 pounds per ton, are valued at 23,112,000 pounds. 12 ships of 7,000 tons each, at 204 pounds per ton, are valued at 17,136,000 pounds. 12 ships of 5,450 tons each, at the same 204 pounds per ton, are valued at 13,341,600 pounds. The total of the three is 33,589,600 pounds.</p>
<p>"During the last world war, the cost per ton of British destroyers was as high as 302 pounds. Now, because the prices are lower, it can be reduced to 200 pounds. Also, we do not want to imitate the large destroyer designs of Italy and France. Therefore, it is appropriate to calculate based on 1,375 tons and 200 pounds per ton. The construction cost of 53 destroyers is 14,575,000.</p>
<p>"The construction cost of submarines is the highest. During the last world war, the highest cost per ton reached 404 pounds. Even now, the construction cost is between 350 pounds. Because it is unknown how the new restrictions of the naval conference in January will be, this construction is entirely based on speculation. It is assumed that half of these 28 ships are used for ocean voyages and half are used for coastal voyages. The total construction cost should be</p>
<p>The total construction cost of the above four items is 154,506,600 pounds, which is also a huge amount. It is just like estimating the repair of an old house that has not been renovated for one or twenty years, and the cost is far more than the old house. It is also like a factory that has not built a new factory for 20 years and its efficiency is very low. It is gradually threatened by its competitors. For the sake of survival and competition, it has to borrow money or raise public debt to update it. The mystery of British naval reconstruction today is revealed in one word. That's it.</p>
<p>When the reporter decided to travel westward, he passed through Aden, the Red Sea, the Suez Canal, and Port Said. He crossed the Mediterranean to Marseille. The magnificent appearance of warships and submarines along the way was shocking. However, the ambitious still think it is not enough. For example, Germany recently built 450 miniature torpedo warships that are smaller but more efficient. Germany's coastline is very short, but it is still rushing to build so many sophisticated ships to prepare for attacking other countries. Looking back at the backward situation of our country's navy, I can't help but be vigilant. (Xu Zhenchi, Marseille, December 7, 24th year of the Republic)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Yushan-Nanchang Section Holds Grand Opening Ceremony - Special Train for Honored Guests Departs Tonight - Survey of Scenery, Historical Sites, and Products Along the Route</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Preparations for the Yushan-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway began in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], surveying was completed in June of the 23rd year [1934], and earthworks officially commenced. From July of the 24th year [1935], track laying was divided into four major sections along the entire line, rushing to complete the project by December. The two major bridges at Liangjiadu and Guixi, where construction was particularly arduous, were completed just in time for the test run. The first train, traveling from Hangzhou to Nanchang, arrived in Nanchang at 2:00 AM on the 10th, after a smooth and successful journey. The grand opening ceremony is now scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 15th in Nanchang. In addition to representatives from the central government, Minister of Railways Zeng Yangfu, Zhejiang political leaders Huang Shaohong, Xu Shaodi, Hu Jianzhong, and Luo Xiatian, as well as financial magnates from the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou area, including Ye Zhuotang, Qian Xinzhi, and Xu Qingfu, and over 300 members of the press, will all participate, making the ceremony exceptionally grand. The special train for honored guests is scheduled to depart from Hangzhou's Jiangbian Station at 7:30 PM on the 13th, arriving in Nanchang on the morning of the 15th. It is noted that the construction of this section took 21 months and required nearly 20 million yuan. The scenery along the route is beautiful and the products abundant. After the opening, there will undoubtedly be tremendous development in culture, transportation, industry, and commerce between the two provinces. A brief account of the construction costs and the state of the products and scenery along this section is provided below.</p>
<p>Construction Costs</p>
<p>The Yushan-Nanchang section, approved by the Ministry of Railways and the governments of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, extends from Yushan Station on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to Nanchang. It is named the Yushan-Nanchang section, and the original Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is renamed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance each issued public bonds worth 12 million yuan, totaling 24 million yuan, as construction capital. 現欵 was borrowed from banking groups and the German company Otto Wolff and materials were purchased on credit, totaling 16 million yuan. The bond face value and all assets and operations after the completion of the Yushan-Nanchang section serve as collateral. The original engineering budget was 16.59 million yuan, but an additional 1.58 million yuan was added to repay survey costs to the Ministry of Railways and to allocate funds for public bond funds and other loan interest. President Zeng Yangfu of the railway is now continuing to borrow from the banking syndicate to make up the difference, which is not expected to be a problem.</p>
<p>Scenery and Historical Sites</p>
<p>Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces have long been known for their scenic spots. Along the railway line, there are bizarre caves and grotesque rocks, cascading waterfalls, majestic peaks and rocks, and serene lakes and marshes. The scenery is uniquely blessed by nature, but very few foreigners are aware of it. Currently, in addition to the North Mountain of Jinhua, Fangyan in Yongkang, Wuxie in Zhuji, and Longhu Mountain in Guixi, which are gradually attracting tourists, the Yushan-Nanchang area also features sites such as the Xinjinag 書院 in Shangrao, where Zhu Xi once studied. The 書院 is located at the foot of Kuishan Mountain, facing the Xinjinag River to the north, backed by Zhongshan Mountain to the south, and overlooking Lingshan and Huaiyu Mountains in the distance, amidst a vast expanse of clouds, offering a very pleasing scene. 横峰 has the Yinshan Cave, and弋阳 has Turtle Peak, the Ruixiang Chan Temple, the Siwei Pavilion, and the Zhenyi Pavilion, among other historical sites and scenic spots. In Guixi, there are the Shangqing Palace, Xiangshan, Shenjing Mountain, Longhu Mountain, Xianyan, and Lengquan, among other attractions. Longhu Mountain is where Zhang Daoling of the Han dynasty refined elixirs, and it features the Longhu Temple and Longhu Stone, and also enshrines a statue of Zhang Daoling. Upon reaching Nanchang, there are scenic spots such as the East, West, and North Lakes and the Pavilion of Prince Teng.</p>
<p>Products Along the Route</p>
<p>Eastern Jiangxi has long been known for its affluence, abundant agricultural products, and highly developed handicrafts. In addition to supplying local consumption, a large number of products are also shipped to domestic and foreign markets. With the suppression of local bandits this year, rural areas are gradually seeing a resurgence. The main products along the Yushan-Nanchang railway line in Shangrao are paper, tea, summer cloth, tea oil, and tung oil. The annual output of paper and tea alone is over 600,000 yuan, all of which is sold within and outside the province. Hengfeng, Yiyang, and Guixi counties are mostly mountainous and have rich coal reserves. Agricultural products include tea oil, medicinal materials, rice, and palm. Guixi's main products are paper, rice, sugarcane, and talc. The annual output of paper products exceeds 150,000. The sugarcane production in Dongxiang is extremely abundant and used to make refined sugar, known as "Dongxiang sugar". Approximately 200,000 catties of lotus root and peanuts are transported to Fuzhou and Nanchang each year. Furthermore, the province has two major handicrafts that have a significant impact on the local economy: paper in Qianshan and porcelain in Jingdezhen. Although sales have been sluggish in recent years due to high transportation costs, the combined annual output of these two items is still as high as 10 million. In the future, using the railway to transport these goods to Zhejiang and then to Beijing and Shanghai will be more economical in terms of both cost and time. Therefore, the future development of industry and commerce is immeasurable. (January 12)</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Du Shigong Captured in Southwestern Fujian - Repents and Drafts Report on Bandit Activities</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The 56th Regiment of the 10th Division stationed in Yongding dispatched troops to Jinshan, Ku Benzhou, and Shuikoushan at the beginning of the year to suppress the remaining bandits. They captured Du Shigong, the chief of staff of the pseudo-Red Army and also the chief of the rear service section of the pseudo-Central Military Commission, the chief of staff of the pseudo-Fujian Military Region, and the chief of staff of the pseudo-Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee, in Shuikoushan, along with Guo Yiwei, the secretary of the pseudo-Special Committee and also the chairman of the Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee and the head of the Party Affairs Department, Yu Zhonghe, the chairman of the pseudo-Shangjin Township Soviet, and the technician Qiu Tianhua. Eight long and short guns were also seized. Du and Guo were key leaders among the bandits and were handed over to the pacification headquarters of the Third District of Longyan. Du was considered to be of high status, being one of the leaders of the remaining bandits in Southwestern Fujian. Du, a native of Sichuan, submitted a letter of repentance after being handed over to Longyan and also drafted a report on bandit activities, detailing the truth about the bandits. The report was published by the pacification headquarters. Key points are summarized below: There is currently a temporary Central Bureau of the Communist Party in Shanghai, with Wang Ming (originally named Chen Shaoyu) as the secretary. The original General Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee was Bo Gu (Qin Bangxian). After a meeting in Guizhou, Luo Fu (Zhang Wentian) was elected to succeed him. Bandit leader Zhang Dingcheng does not understand military affairs and is very different from Fang Zhimin. Zhang and Deng Zihui are incompatible and often clash. The pseudo-18th and 19th Regiments have no faith in Zhang at all, making them very easy to capture. The organization of the pseudo-Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee is as follows: Zhang Dingcheng is the chairman, Deng Zihui is the chairman of the Finance and Economy Committee, Tan Zhenlin is the Minister of Military Affairs (former Commander and Political Commissar of the Fujian Military Region), Fang Fang is the Director of the Political Department, and Jian Zaiwen is the Acting Director of the Political Department. The strength of the bandit party in Southwestern Fujian is as follows: the 17th and 18th Regiments are in Yong'an Ningxiang, operating in a scattered manner, with about 1,000 men and 70% having guns. Fang Fang leads a unit of about 200 men detached from the pseudo-9th Regiment, as well as dozens from the Mingguang Independent Battalion, also with 70% having guns. The Daiying County Committee commands the pseudo-Daiying Independent Battalion, with 80 to 90 men and 80% having guns. The Daiying Yongdong Special Zone commands the Yongdong First, Second, and Third Battalions, totaling 50 to 60 men. The Longyan County Committee commands the Longyan Guerrilla Brigade, with dozens of men. The Yongding County Committee commands the Yongding Independent Battalion, with 70 men and over 40 guns. The Yongding Anti-Japanese Second Battalion has 30 men and over 20 guns. The remaining bandits of the pseudo-Independent 9th Regiment number over 90 and are currently led by Xie Yucai, the political commissar of the regiment, operating in the Yongdong area together with the Yongdong guerrillas. The pseudo-Independent 8th Regiment had over 200 men a month ago. Recent news indicates that Qiu Zhiyun, the political commissar of the regiment, was killed by regimental troops, and the situation of the troops is unknown. Some say they have been annihilated by the National Army. There is also the pseudo-Fujian-Guangdong Border Area Special Committee (under the jurisdiction of the pseudo-Temporary Central Bureau in Shanghai), which commands the pseudo-Red Army 3rd Regiment, with over 200 men and 70% having guns, and the pseudo-Red Army 3rd Battalion, with about 100 men. A few months ago, these two units and the pseudo-9th Regiment joined forces in the Dabu area of Guangdong and then dispersed. The communication between the pseudo-Southwestern Fujian Military and Political Committee and Shanghai goes through Shantou Pubei Nanlu (Yongding Zhongjin Xiushanbei Yankeng Limin District, all the way to Yanxiashan). It is said to take six days to travel from Zhongjin to the bandit leaders' residence. This is the general situation. Regarding the bandit party organization in Yongding, the secretary of the pseudo-Yongding County Committee is Huang Dasheng, and the standing committee member is Ma Yongchang. The County Committee has jurisdiction over two districts: 1. Shangxi South Central District; 2. Xiaxi South Central District. The bandit party is working in Jinsha Gumu Township. The Shangnanxi Guerrilla Team has now been wiped out, and the Central District Committee has been completely destroyed. The secretary of the Xia Nan District Central Committee has reportedly fled.

<h3>Yellow River Conservancy Actively Proceeding with Yellow River Breach Closure Project - Expediting Material Transport, Ice Breaking, and Navigation to Facilitate Transportation - Public Bond Mortgage Procedures Finalized, Signing Imminent</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and in charge of the Yellow River breach closure in Dongzhuang, Shandong, has been actively working and sparing no effort since taking over the breach closure project. He is mortgaging 3 million yuan of Disaster Relief Public Bonds to banking circles in Jinan as funds for the breach closure work. Minister Kong (Xiangxi) has telegraphed the Shanghai Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications headquarters to notify the Jinan branches to proceed. Therefore, on the 8th, Kong rushed to Jinan from Dongzhuang to meet with Jinan banking circles and handle the signing procedures. After Kong arrived in Jinan, all measures were agreed upon with banking circles, and a contract was drafted. The formal signing should take place within a day or two. As for the Yellow River breach closure project, material transport and construction are progressing rapidly. 石料 and 稭料, the main materials, should all be transported to the construction site within a month, so as not to delay the project. The authorities are currently digging frozen soil and breaking ice to advance, with the aim of completing the west dam base before the old lunar year and closing the breach around the time of the peach blossom flood. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Expediting Material Transport and Ice Breaking for Navigation</p>
<p>Materials are being transported actively. (A) For 석료, 30,000 cubic meters have been ordered from Dahushan on the Longhai Railway and 10,000 cubic meters each from Heshangqiao Road and Wangfen on the Pinghan Railway, totaling over 10,000 市方. All locomotives and trains have been handed over to the Longhai Railway for management. A timetable has been set for the Yellow River Conservancy Commission trains between Dahushan Lanfeng and Zhengzhou Luowang, with at least 900 cubic meters of 석료 being transported daily, which should be completed in a month and a half. However, since the entire river is currently frozen from Dongbatou to Dongzhuang, a distance of about 200 里, the transportation director Wang Youlong has been instructed to lead the deputy director and coordinate with the river affairs bureau to properly dispatch soldiers and laborers to break the ice for navigation. Telegrams have also been sent to the counties along the river, including Dongming Lanfeng Heze Kaocheng Fengqiu Yeyang, to coordinate the work and avoid delays. In addition, over 1,000 市方 of 石 stored by the Yellow River Conservancy Association will be allocated for breach closure to provide assistance. It is estimated that as long as ice breaking is carried out to open navigation, the plan can be completed without delaying the project. (B) Each county is entrusted to purchase and transport 楷料: Heze 300 垜, plus an additional 200 垜, totaling 500 垜; Juancheng 200 垜; Puyang 100 垜; Dingtao 200 垜; Juye 300 垜; Changyuan 100 垜; Dongming 300 垜; Kaocheng 100 垜; Lanfeng 100 垜; Puyang 300 垜; Fanxian 100 垜; Caoxian 200 槓; Chengwu 100 垜; Chaocheng 100 垜. In addition, Huaxian Liuzhi 300 and Changyuan Jianming Heze and other counties will also be responsible for Liuzhi, totaling 1,000 垜, all to be delivered before the lunar new year. Replies have been received from the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, all ordering compliance. Kong is sending personnel to various counties to urge progress. The materials should all be gathered at the construction site in about a month.</p>
<p>Digging Frozen Soil and Breaking Ice to Advance</p>
<p>With the two main materials, 稭料 and 石, already secured, the project is progressing very rapidly. Frozen soil is being dug when frozen, and ice is being broken to advance when ice is present. The West dam base is planned to be completed before the old lunar new year, leaving only 300 meters between the east and west collapse points. Once the ice surge occurs, the Jiangsu dam head extension project has penetrated deep into the river, about ten zhang in length. In the future, this dam will be used to divert the flow towards the main river, which can reduce the amount of water flowing through the breach. After the ice flood, the breach will be closed around the time of the peach flood, following the effective methods of Kong's two previous closures at Fenglou Guantai, completing the project in one go. The project office will soon issue a detailed report on the project. Kong has been in Dongzhuang for days, guiding the work, and also accompanied Jiangsu representatives Wu Tongju and Taderjun, as well as Westerner Anlisen, the deputy chief engineer of the site, chief engineers Wu Nankai and Wu Sidu, and deputy directors of the project office Liu Bingzhong and Zhu Changan, among others, carrying charts to conduct on-site surveys of the entire work on both banks. Kong also directed the preparation of diversion canals at suitable locations on the old riverbed and inner beach, which was approved by the colleagues at work and the Jiangsu representatives.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Police Chief Accused of Dereliction of Duty and Harming the People - Supervisory Yuan and Provincial Government Send Personnel to Wuhu to Investigate - Zhang Zongfen Leaves Wuhu, Various Circles Plan to Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Zhang Zongfen, the police chief of Wuhu, has been arbitrarily arresting and fining people, derelicting his duty and extorting money, arousing public outrage. After repeated meetings, resolutions were made to telegraph the Supervisory Yuan and the Provincial Government, appealing for his removal and punishment, and to file a lawsuit with the court. The Supervisory Yuan has now dispatched supervisor Wu Hantao, the Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office has dispatched Secretary Hu Yiguan, and the Provincial Government has dispatched Chen Baozhen, a member of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Association, who have successively arrived in Wuhu to investigate. The amount of huge fines imposed by the police station is countless, and no receipts are given. Furthermore, the heartless punishment of a family during a major fire, resulting in 11 deaths, and the fine of 600 yuan imposed on the Hongda Chang soy sauce garden are solid evidence of dereliction of duty and harm to the people. All the investigating officials are outraged. After supervisor Wu arrived in Wuhu, he stayed at the Southeast Hotel. Various circles sent representatives such as Cui Lianggong and She Ceqin, standing committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, to receive him. He instructed them to convene all relevant legal groups at the Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM today. Wu and others intend to attend to listen to the complaints of all parties and collect evidence. Wu also stated that President Yu of the Supervisory Yuan was extremely angered after receiving the telegram from Wuhu, so the central authorities also attach great importance to it. The Wuhu Local Court, based on the formal accusation by the County Party Headquarters, has issued summonses to Zhang Zongfen and the witness, lawyer Wu Zhilu, to begin the investigation. It has also requested various circles to send meeting minutes for reference. Surprisingly, Zhang Zongfen, seeing the tense situation and the strict investigation, quietly left Wuhu at 4:00 PM yesterday. The police station announced that he was going to the province on official business. However, Chu Chengye, the director of the Fourth Branch of Henan, fearing that he could not escape punishment for ordering the fine on Hongda Chang, had already abandoned his post and fled a few days ago. The Commissioner's Office has now issued an arrest warrant. However, the Party Headquarters has learned that two members of the Chamber of Commerce and Cui Songgu, who claims to be a gentleman, are taking this opportunity to send a letter to Zhang Zongfen, requesting that Zhao be appointed as the director of the Fourth Branch. They believe that this is a betrayal of the entire Wuhu's character and have filed an accusation to warn against evil and deception. They have also resolved to send a letter to various circles and dispatch representatives to petition in Beijing, so that the central government can understand the suffering of the people of Anhui.

As for the Nanchang-Pingxiang section of the railway, it has been decided that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau will be responsible for construction. The route will pass through Wenjiazhen, Zhangzhan Yichun, and Yue Liling to reach Changsha. The groundbreaking ceremony will be held simultaneously with the opening ceremony on the 15th. The funds will come from the Ministry of Railways issuing 27 million yuan in railway bonds, which will be mortgaged to a banking syndicate including the Bank of China for 8 million yuan in cash and to the German Otto Wolff Iron Factory for 8 million yuan in materials. The public bond fund will be set aside by the Ministry of Railways, starting in August of last year, with 250,000 yuan from monthly surpluses being entrusted to the banking syndicate for safekeeping, to be used for principal repayment. It is said that construction will be carried out in sections after the groundbreaking ceremony, and the entire section should be open to traffic within the year. The authorities are currently planning to extend the railway westward from Changsha into Sichuan, reaching directly to Shaanxi, becoming China's east-west trunk line. This will greatly benefit the economy, transportation, and national defense in the future. (January 10)</p>

<p>County Magistrate Tours Various Districts</p>
<p>The provincial office's regulations regarding the self-renewal registration and general inspection measures for the anti-smoking policy are very strict. The county government has set a deadline for the districts to comply and complete the task, with the aim of achieving complete elimination. County Magistrate Li believes that compulsory literacy education, the promotion of 保甲, the dissemination of information on pest control, and the collection of old taxes are all important tasks that require supervision. Therefore, on the 13th, he personally led the section members Shen Jizhou and Le Fan, departing to tour the various districts. County Magistrate Li ordered that each district summon the heads of townships, towns, and 保甲 to give speeches, and instructed the accompanying section members to record the inspection situation separately for review.

<p>During the winter defense period in this county, robbery cases have occurred one after another, and residents are in a state of anxiety. The head of Civil affairs, Yu, was greatly angered that criminals dared to be so rampant in the provincial capital, and that the police officers were not performing their duties.

<p>Gold Buddha Stolen from Donglin Temple</p>
<p>Eight or nine bandits broke into the temple. The abbot, Monk Daolin, was awakened from his dream, tied up with ropes, and beaten severely, causing serious injuries to his chest and back. They threatened him with a handgun, forcing him to reveal the location of the silver. They then looted the temple, stealing a gold Buddha weighing about six taels, 237 yuan in banknotes, and leather clothing, with a total loss of over 1,000 yuan. In addition, at the Zhong'an Great King Temple in Yemiao Isle on the Wuli Lake in the Third District, 13 shi of white rice were stolen on the day before last. The temple manager, Wang Arong, had been robbed twice before, and was injured and died. This time, Arong's wife, Zhang, was robbed a third time, and all her belongings were taken.

<p>Aftermath of the Qingyang Long-Distance Bus Overturn Disaster</p>
<p>The Qing(jiang)yang(zhou) long-distance bus No. Su 1208 of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department's Highway Management Office, carrying 20 passengers, overturned into the river near the Fengshen Temple Qigong Hall outside the north gate of this county at about 2:00 PM on the 6th, drowning ten people. Eight bodies were recovered. The situation has been reported in this newspaper. Jin Guide, the driver in charge of the bus, fled south after the accident. He was recently arrested in Shaobo by the second squadron of the Provincial Public Security Team on the water and sent to the county government along with the co-driver Chuan Xingfa. After the trial, the two confessed that most of the bus's parts were damaged, the brakes were not working, it was overloaded, and one of the wheels had fallen off, causing the accident. After the interrogation, they were ordered to be detained first. The judge specifically went to the scene of the accident yesterday with officials and clerks from the Judicial Section to inspect the bus. The result confirmed that the brakes were not working. As for the eight bodies recovered, the names of six people were detailed in the previous news. The names of the other two are added below: Xie Chuanli (from Jiangdu) and Yang Jian (from Huaian, 17 years old, studying at Yangzhou Middle School). Qiu Yuhang (from Wujin), the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department's county guidance engineer and chief inspector of the Highway Management Office, came to Gaoyou yesterday. County Magistrate Cao agreed with Qiu that each of the eight bodies recovered would be given 60 yuan for clothing and coffins (20 yuan for clothing and 40 yuan for coffins), which would be allocated by the county government as a legitimate expense. County Magistrate Cao, considering that the county government employee Li Zhengshu, who died in the accident, was friendly and amiable and worked hard, specially initiated a public memorial service by the county government colleagues to console his spirit. It was originally scheduled to be held yesterday, but due to insufficient preparation, it was changed to the 18th at the Chengtian Temple outside the north gate, where the spirit is temporarily placed. His brother, Li Zhengxue, has come to Gaoyou with his wife and concubines to handle the funeral.</p>

<h3>Trends in Teacher Education (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Chang Daozhi, Head of the Education Department of National Central University</p>
<p>The task of modern teacher education is not only to cultivate teachers who impart simple knowledge and skills to children, but more importantly, to cultivate national mentors.</p>
<p>The scope of activities of primary school teachers is not limited to the classroom, but also to extend their influence to the school and the surrounding living environment, so that primary schools become local cultural centers, and teachers become leaders of the people. In recent years, the new teacher training systems in Germany and the Soviet Union have been planned in accordance with this new need. In 1925, the Prussian education authorities declared that the training goal of national school teachers should not be limited to cultivating teachers in the classroom, but also to cultivating educators and mentors for the people. Recently, an important measure in the National Socialist teacher education policy in Germany is to move all teacher colleges to rural and border areas. The reason for moving to rural areas is that rural villages far from cities are considered to be the best place to maintain the purity of German national essence, so that teacher students can have a more personal experience of national culture and have practical contact with the daily life of the people, so that they can have a correct understanding of the educational needs of the people. The reason for distributing them along the border is that teacher training institutions are regarded as a kind of cultural fortress; on the one hand, they are spiritual fortresses for national defense, and at the same time, they are bases for promoting their own culture abroad. This far-reaching teacher education policy is indeed an innovation in the history of human culture!</p>
<p>Let’s look at socialist countries again. The Soviet authorities have long had a deep understanding of the importance of teachers' role in social transformation. Lenin once said: "We must raise the status of teachers to a height that they have never reached and will never be able to reach in bourgeois society." The reason why ordinary teachers are particularly valued by socialist countries is because they see that the influence of a teacher's work is by no means limited to the classroom, but can extend to the broad masses of the people. The training that future educational workers in Russia receive in educational colleges is not only the preparation necessary for classroom work, but also includes lectures on various strategies for leading and participating in social movements. Judging from the current situation in our country, the proposition that primary school teachers should also be leaders of the people at the same time contains profound significance and should always be listed as one of the main goals of normal schools.</p>
<p>The content of teacher education is the synthesis of teaching material knowledge, teaching skills, and personality cultivation. Efforts should be made to maintain balance and not allow any neglect.</p>
<p>Analyzing the content of teacher education in various countries, it includes teaching material knowledge, teaching skills, and personality cultivation, but each has its own emphasis. Generally speaking, France places more emphasis on teaching material knowledge, the country focuses on method training, and Britain and Germany attach equal importance to both. As for personality cultivation, the curriculum of Germany, Russia, Italy and other countries has recently added philosophical cultivation.</p>
<p>The 1923 teacher education reform in Italy clearly recognized that a broad philosophical understanding of life is the most important, and that teaching methods and educational theories determine it. We only need to browse the many famous philosophical works listed in the oral examination section on "Philosophy and Education" in the graduation examination of its teachers' college to imagine its emphasis on philosophical cultivation.</p>
<p>In the curriculum of educational colleges in Russia, there are subjects such as the materialistic historical view, dialectics, and the history of class struggle; they believe that these subjects are spiritual weapons for maintaining all Soviet institutions. In Germany, institutions for training national school teachers mostly include philosophy, ethics, aesthetics, etc. in the professional curriculum. For general German educators, the importance of philosophical cultivation is by no means inferior to the proficiency of teaching techniques.</p>
<p>Before 1922, the curriculum of normal schools in our country comparatively emphasized the aspect of teaching material knowledge. After the promulgation of the new school system in 1922, under the influence of American education, it showed a trend of emphasizing educational subjects. Since the implementation of the normal school regulations in 1933, this point has been corrected. As for the subjects of personality cultivation, there was a morality course in the normal schools in the late Qing Dynasty. The normal school regulations of the Republic of China in the first year remained unchanged. After the eighth year of the Republic of China, morality was changed to civics. The standard outline of the normal school curriculum in the new school system of the Republic of China in the twelfth year of the Republic of China listed "Philosophy of Life" as a compulsory subject. After the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the normal school curriculum first listed "Party Ideology". The normal school regulations of the recent twenty-second year of the Republic of China again set up a civics course. According to the content of the civics course, it is usually based on common sense of politics, economy and other civics, which has a difference in breadth and narrowness from the philosophy subjects of Italy and Germany, or the "social science" of the Soviet Union. In order to complete the personality cultivation aspect of teacher education, it seems appropriate to expand the content of the civics course. In addition to imparting various common sense necessary for civic life, it is necessary to pay attention to forming their great life ideals and lofty professional ethics; as for the general guidance policy of normal schools, the close relationship to the personality cultivation of teachers goes without saying.</p>
<p>Teacher education is not only a trade training, but also a professional preparation.</p>
<p>The difference between a trade and a profession is that the former focuses on the proficiency of practical skills, while the latter must be rooted in advanced academic theory. In the past, the training methods of primary school teachers were similar to the apprenticeship system in the industry and commerce sectors, and it was not without reason that it was regarded as a trade. At present, due to the progress of education and psychological science, it is not effective for those engaged in education work to have sufficient educational knowledge; at the same time, because the function of modern primary schools has been expanded, it is even more necessary for teachers to have a solid foundation of general education. Due to the progress of professional knowledge and the improvement of general education, primary school education work has advanced from a trade to a professional position. As a result, on the one hand, the social status of teachers has been improved, and on the other hand, the social responsibilities borne by teachers have also been correspondingly increased. Since the state entrusts the education of future citizens to teachers, teachers should take it as their own responsibility to strive to realize the educational goals of the country and live up to the entrustment of the country.

<h3>Niu Yongjian Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Waiting for a Boat to Go South to Welcome Hu; Scheduled to Leave on the 14th or 15th</h3>
<p>Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, left Beijing on the 11:00 pm express train the night before and arrived in Shanghai at about 7:00 am yesterday. After getting off the train, he returned to his residence to rest. It is reported that Niu came here with the intention of taking the President Coolidge of the Great Lai Company or the Empress of Canada of the Changxing Company on the 14th to go south in a private capacity to welcome Hu Hanmin, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, and to attend the annual meeting of the Chinese Social Education Society and observe the social education situation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Considers the Difficulties of Business; Does Not Levy Transaction Tax; Accepts the Request of Gu Xin'yi</h3>
<p>The Industry Association stated that the Ministry of Finance had originally planned to officially levy transaction tax from July 1 of that year in accordance with the transaction tax regulations promulgated by the National Government last year. Later, the Joint Association of the Five Exchanges in this city and the Joint Association of Brokers sent representatives to Beijing to petition for a postponement of the levy. Minister Kong Xiangxi, considering the difficulties of business, issued an order to Shanghai on June 30, approving the extension of the period by six months, which was expected to begin on February 1 of this year. Yesterday, it was learned from relevant parties that the Ministry of Finance believes that the market is sluggish, industry and commerce are extremely depressed, and although the monetary policy has been implemented, all industries in the country have not been able to restore their former appearance. The Shanghai Stock Exchange only operates in valuable securities, and the gauze and cloth industry is sluggish due to the poor business performance of manufacturers. The gold, grain, and flour industries can only maintain the status quo, and their business has declined compared to the past. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance has accepted the request of Gu Xin'yi, Chairman of the Miscellaneous Grain Association, who went to Beijing, and decided not to levy transaction tax on these exchanges.</p>
<h3>Heavy Smuggling in North China; Affects Tariff Revenue</h3>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Agency reported from this port that smuggled artificial silk, sugar, etc. from North China have begun to flow into the Yangtze River basin, Shanghai, and other places, oppressing the market and causing trouble for legitimate businesses. The current market price of refined sugar is 21 yuan, while the original price is only 7 yuan. Legitimate businesses cannot compete with smugglers no matter what. Moreover, even if two out of three smuggling attempts are seized, it is still profitable. This has a significant impact on tariff revenue and deserves attention. (Shanghai Daily News)</p>

After the letter was sent, a reply was received stating that the new regulations have already been implemented and it is difficult to change them midway. The original plan should still be maintained temporarily to avoid different penalties being implemented before and after the same year, resulting in uneven burdens on the owners. It is proposed to discuss and revise them again when the new tax is levied in 1936. The Ministry of Finance has also sent a letter informing the provincial government that the regulations have been revised and submitted to the ministry for verification before the new tax is levied in 1936.

<h3>The Municipal Government Orders the Public Security Bureau to Report the Actual Number of Households in the City for the Preparation of the National Congress Election</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved the telegram from the Ministry of Interior, stating that the National Congress will be convened this year and representatives will be elected. It is necessary to report the actual number of households to the ministry before the deadline.

The National Congress will be convened this year, and the election of representatives requires knowing the exact number of households nationwide to facilitate implementation. The provincial and municipal governments have reported on the handling of Baojia for a long time, and the household registration has been completed. It is hoped that the household registration will be based on the most recent household registration of the Baojia and reported to the ministry within one month of the telegram. The government will collect and report to the ministry. Areas where Baojia has not been held must be completed by March 10 and the number of households must be reported separately. This matter is important and must not be delayed. For the purpose of conducting a citywide general review from November 16 to 30 of last year, it has now been a long time and the total number of households has not been reported. The reason for the telegram is that the bureau should comply with the instructions, quickly and accurately compile statistics, and report them separately for verification and transfer.

<h3>Obstacles Occur on the Sea Line Between Shanghai and Nagasaki; It Will Take Four or Five Days to Communicate</h3>

<h3>As the Lunar New Year Approaches, the Rice Market Sales Become Smooth; Prices Are Slightly Higher Than Before; Rice Boats from Various Gangs Begin to Settle Accounts</h3>
<p>Dago News Agency reported that as the Lunar New Year is approaching, citizens are stocking up on food for the New Year. Therefore, the purchase and sale volume of various local and foreign gangs in recent days has doubled compared to the past. As a result, rice prices have risen slightly since the day before yesterday. However, the prices of first-class rice and third-class rice remain unchanged. The amount of rice stored in this city is only 40,000 to 50,000 shi. However, farmers in Changshu, Wuxi, Wu Kun, and other counties in the interior are eagerly selling brown rice before the New Year, and each shi is only 5 yuan. Therefore, various firms in the interior are becoming increasingly tight on funds and dare not purchase and store too much. Although farmers have goods, they have no way to sell them.</p>
<p>Various Gangs Settle Accounts The rice boat merchants of various gangs have gradually reduced the amount of rice they have transported to Shanghai in the past week. The last batch of rice boats will stop on the 20th of this month. The various ship merchants of the gangs in Shanghai are now starting to conduct settlement procedures with the merchants, preparing to return to their hometowns as soon as possible for the New Year. The first batch of rice in the spring of the Lunar New Year will be transported to Shanghai for sale on the 27th of this month (ie, the fourth day of the Lunar New Year).</p>
<p>The Situation of the Year The Dago News Agency reporter learned from the rice industry in this city yesterday that the rice industry in this city has declined compared to previous years. The biggest reason is that the silver capital is tight and the financial community has tightened the rice and grain remittance. In addition, the flood in the autumn caused rumors in the country, resulting in weak purchasing power. Under these circumstances, it is fortunate that the rice industry can survive smoothly. However, at the time of the Lunar New Year settlement, those with less capital and difficulty in調度 are likely to be unable to avoid ceasing operations.</p>
<h3>The Paid-Up Capital of the Ministry of Industry's Paper Mill Has Been Fully Raised; 600,000 Shares for Merchants and 3.9 Million Shares for the Government; Expected to Pay Up in February and Start Work in Early April</h3>

In addition to the 600,000 shares for merchants, which have been undertaken by the Commercial Press, China Book Bureau, Shenbao, and Xinwenbao, and will be paid up by the end of February, the 3.9 million shares for the government have also been approved to be borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund and will be repaid by the Ministry of Industry. It is expected to be allocated within this month. The preparatory office of the factory has decided to send personnel to survey the factory site, build the factory building, and purchase machinery as soon as the funds are allocated. Construction is scheduled to begin in early April, with the aim of completing the paper production next spring.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection Group Changed Arrival in Beijing to Last Night; Trip Called Off at the Last Minute the Night Before</h3>
<p>The China inspection group organized by members of the Japanese House of Representatives, etc., arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao a few days ago. They have been very busy in Shanghai with banquets and socializing with the Japanese community. The group was originally scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the evening of the 12th to pay respects to our authorities, then rescheduled to the evening of the 11th. Unexpectedly, the trip was postponed again at the last minute due to unforeseen circumstances. It is now decided that a group of twelve people, including Nakano, will take the night express train from Shanghai to Beijing on the evening of the 12th to pay respects to our central authorities and visit Beijing's construction projects. After staying in Beijing for one day, they will take the night express train out of Beijing on the evening of the 13th and arrive in Shanghai at about 7:00 a.m. on the 14th, then embark on the "Nagasaki Maru" to return to Japan.</p>

<h3>Those Who Used Secret Mark Vouchers Unite to Oppose the Cancellation of Voucher Usage; Petitioned Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and Chen Guangfu; Mediation is Now Underway to Seek an Early Resolution</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, in the past, various banks in Shanghai that enjoyed the right to issue currency, in order to develop their respective businesses, had entered into contracts with various Qian Zhuang banks for the use of secret mark vouchers. After the Ministry of Finance stipulated on November 4th of last year that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender and centrally issued, banks such as the Dalu Bank cancelled the contracts for the use of secret mark vouchers, which aroused opposition from the voucher users. They organized a joint office to fight for their rights. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Voucher Method Banks that enjoyed the right to issue currency, in addition to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, included the China Industrial Bank, the Siming Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the Commercial Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, the Reclamation Bank, and the Four Banks (i.e., the China South Bank, the Dalu Bank, the Jin Cheng Bank, and the Salt Industry Bank). For the exchange vouchers used by colleagues, secret marks were printed on the face of the vouchers to identify them. The voucher method was to use 60% cash and 40% guarantee to use 100% of the banknotes. Because the interest on the 40% guarantee, such as securities, was enjoyed by the voucher user, the voucher user naturally had more profits and would be happy to exercise the right, and the effect was also significant.</p>
<p>After the Cancellation Since the Ministry of Finance announced on November 4th of last year that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender and centrally issued, banks such as the Dalu Bank, the China Industrial Bank, and the China South Bank first cancelled the method of using secret mark vouchers. The Qian Zhuang banks that used the secret mark vouchers had signed contracts, so more than 60 Qian Zhuang banks, including Yuan Feng, jointly organized a joint office of voucher users to fight for their rights. Yuan Feng and 13 other Qian Zhuang banks filed a lawsuit against the Dalu Bank with the First Special District Court to confirm the validity of the contract and the payment of past interest. The court held a hearing on the 30th of last month, and a retrial is scheduled for the 14th.</p>
<p>Joint Petition The joint office of voucher users sent representatives Qiu Yuru and others to petition Du Yuesheng, a member of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, Yu Zuoting, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Banking Association, presenting their reasons and asking them to uphold justice. Du Yuesheng, Yu Zuoting, and Chen Guangfu met with them separately and agreed to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Petition The reasons stated in the petition were that the Ministry of Finance's decision to reform the currency system was entirely to prevent the outflow of silver from the country. Therefore, on November 4th, it resolutely ordered the cessation of the use of silver coins, and the Ministry order stated that the banknotes of the banks that already enjoyed the right to issue currency would be allowed to continue to be used as usual, and that the amount of issuance would be limited to the total amount as of November 3rd and would not be increased. The Ministry of Finance would determine a time limit to gradually exchange them for central banknotes, etc. From this, it can be known that the banknotes of various commercial banks that have already been circulating on the market can continue to be used as usual before the Ministry of Finance announces a time limit for recovery. However, the reserve funds of each bank are transferred to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping, which does not conflict with the actual issuance and does not hinder it.</p>
<p>Efforts to Mediate It is now heard that Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, etc. have agreed with Hu Mengjia, general manager of the China Industrial Bank, that the interest of the voucher users in 1935 will be paid as usual, and that the contract will continue to be valid. As for the Donglai Bank, which is basically a central legal tender, there is no problem. The lawsuit against the Dalu Bank can also be postponed, and Du Yuesheng and others will further seek to bring the two sides closer. It is heard that Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, etc. will invite banks that have voucher users to discuss and make an overall mediation to seek an early resolution.</p>

It was resolved that if merchants in the city requested rent reduction but were denied by the landlord and pursued for rent arrears, they should be rescued. It was resolved that if the above situation occurs, they can be protected by the district associations affiliated to the joint association in accordance with the law. It was resolved to organize a design committee to plan the selection of rent reduction committee members and the work plan, and to hand it over to the next joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees (scheduled for the 19th of this month) for handling. It was resolved to endorse the Shanghai Municipal Council's stipulation that property interest should not exceed 5%, and to submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Government for promulgation after being approved by the Executive Yuan, as a reference to the draft mediation plan for rental disputes in Beijing and Shanghai. It was resolved to approve the case of Yu Qing Fang on North Sichuan Road in Zhabei District, who was forced to relocate by the landlord through a British merchant on the pretext of requesting rent reduction, and to ask for assistance.

<h3>Various Anti-Smoking Hospitals in the City Have Completed Expansion and Are Continuing to Admit Patients; Registration of All Smokers Will Be Completed Today; The Total Will Reach 40,000 and Will Be Announced Immediately</h3>
<p>The total number of smokers registered in this city during the registration period, which lasted six months, will be completely counted by the Public Security Bureau today. Various lists will be compiled and reported to the Xingying. The anti-smoking work has come to an end. The three anti-smoking hospitals for criminals in South Shanghai, North Shanghai, and for criminals have completed the expansion of their beds today and will continue to admit smokers who have not quit smoking. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Smoker Statistics Completed Today</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's registration of smoker statistics, from July to December, totaled 30,636 people. From the 21st to the 31st, the continued registration, as of the previous (11th), together with the list sent by each branch, totaled 36,6491 people, including 12,6913 people with ordinary licenses, 17,9471 people with poor people's licenses, and 9 travel permits. There are still lists from several branches that have not been sent, and it is estimated that there are still many. In addition, there are 4,041 people who have been given smoking cessation treatment. Today, all the lists submitted by each branch have been collected, so the total number of registered smokers can be completed and will be announced immediately. Various smoker lists will be actively classified and compiled and reported to the Municipal Government for submission to the Military Commission's Xingying for review.</p>
<p>Anti-Smoking Hospitals Complete Expansion</p>
<p>The temporary anti-smoking hospital jointly planned by the Bureau and the Health Bureau was suspended due to funding issues. However, because there are a large number of smokers quitting smoking, the existing three anti-smoking hospitals for criminals in South Shanghai, North Shanghai, and for criminals have been expanded. Starting last Wednesday (the 8th), double beds have been set up to double the number of beds in order to accommodate a large number of smokers sent for smoking cessation. It is known that the hospitals have completed the installation of additional beds yesterday (the 12th). From today, the three hospitals in South Shanghai, North Shanghai, and for criminals have resumed admitting smokers for smoking cessation, and the Public Security Bureau will immediately send hundreds of people who have not quit smoking for treatment in order to complete the anti-smoking work. In addition, according to the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Anti-Smoking, smokers who are found smoking without a license this month will be uniformly stopped from issuing smoking cessation licenses and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters of the Shanghai Military Judicial Organs for handling, and will be sentenced to imprisonment for six months to two years and fined up to 300 yuan. Because the investigation and arrest work is still being carried out seriously, there are several cases every day, and smoking dens are also occasionally cracked down on.</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Issues Instructions on Factory Land Acquisition Methods</h3>
<p>The National Products Factory Association received instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the Executive Yuan Secretariat函opened,奉The Central Executive Committee交办Jiangsu Province Party Headquarters,呈请stipulating factory四週land ownership, 工廠得隨時請求政府估價轉移one case,應分交內實兩部議復,抄同原件函達查照 etc., After repeated consultations, it was generally believed that the land acquisition method had already been promulgated and implemented in various national product factories. Those that are run by the government can apply for land acquisition in accordance with the law. Those that are run by the people or companies and groups for profit should still purchase land through free trading. The request to separately stipulate the government's valuation and mandatory transfer is inconsistent with the provisions of the ownership chapter of the Civil Law's property rights and should not be approved. However, at this time of industrial decline, the government should also support its development. If national product factories in various places do need to expand, the local government can examine the situation and persuade the landowners adjacent to the factories to transfer the land at an appropriate price, so that both laws and facts can be taken into account, etc., and the meeting was presented for approval by the Executive Yuan, etc.</p>

<h3>Zheng Yongkang Generously Agreed to Reduce Rent; Reduced to 90% from July of Last Year; Water Fees Are Also Waived at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The Yongji Lane houses on Tangshan Road in Hongkou are owned by Zheng Yongkang's account room, with a total of more than 170 buildings. Since the Shanghai War, the market has been in a slump and has reached its extreme. In order to maintain mutual support and reduce expenses, the tenants of the lane organized the Yongji Lane Rent Reduction Branch to appeal to the landlord for rent reduction. After several resolutions, the request was ineffective. Special Envoy Yu Jikang made a final request to Fang Shu. Because Zheng Yongkang saw the tenants' repeated requests, he generously agreed to the rent reduction methods as follows: The rent will be calculated at 90% from July 1935. Water fees will also be waived from July 1935. The street cleaning fee was originally two cents and has been increased to three cents because the landlord has hired one more person.

<h3>Shanghai National Products Company's Auction News; Compatriots' Enthusiasm for the National Products Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, in order to urgently repay its debts, publicly auctioned off 42 national products at 10% to 40% off a few days ago. Patriotic compatriots came from far and wide, and the number of customers reached more than 100,000 every day, breaking the record of all the shopping malls in Shanghai. It is heard that the company, in view of the customers' enthusiasm for buying national products, has further reduced the prices of various national products to the extreme, such as silk, woolen cloth, cloth, cotton textiles, leather goods, Gu embroidery, shoes, hats, children's clothing, stationery, toys, and steel essence, all of which are sold at 10% to 40% off. Starting today, a large batch of coarse and fine leather goods newly unsealed by the court will be auctioned off on the second floor at the same time. The cheapness of the pricing is shocking, as it is sold at 60% of the original price. There are many people who go to buy it. Although the company feels a huge loss due to the auction price, it is in line with the principles of social economy. It is willing to allow the citizens to obtain high-quality goods at low prices, and sell national products to the Chinese people, so it does not hesitate to make all sacrifices.</p>

<h3>Two Gangs of Workers Clash at Chenjia Wharf Over Work - Bao Afu and Another Wounded, Three Arrested and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>At Chenjia Wharf in Huayuan Port, Nanshi, regarding the coal shipped to Shanghai by the Kaiping, Huabei, and Zhongxing coal companies for military use, the contract was originally held by Liu Dekui from Tianjin, who employed over a hundred workers to handle the loading, unloading, and carrying. This had been ongoing for over ten years, delivering specifically to the Huashang Electric Company for fuel, and had been peaceful. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around seven o'clock, Chen Shoucai led several dozen workers, including Xiao Qingsheng, to take over the carrying work at Chenjia Wharf that was originally contracted to Liu Dekui. The original workers at the wharf, considering Chen and others to be forcibly seizing their work and infringing on their livelihoods, unanimously refused. Chen Shoucai and his group then ordered the workers they brought to start beating people, leading to a clash between the two sides. The local police station, upon hearing the news, dispatched officers to suppress the situation, but due to the large number of workers, they were unable to control it. They immediately reported to the Ximen Branch, which promptly sent a large number of detectives to the scene. Only then did the workers disperse. As a result, worker Bao Afu, from Shandong, 46 years old, suffered an eye injury, and Xia Qingsheng, from Qingjiang, 40 years old, suffered a head injury. Both were sent to the hospital for treatment. Li Genfa, Wei Shouqin, and Li Shuze were among the three arrested. Liu Dekui, the contractor of the wharf, also reported the incident to the authorities, detailing the dispute. The 文申 office then issued instructions to send the case to the General Bureau.</p>
<h3>Fire Engulfs Chai Hang Warehouse in Shenjia Alley, Pudong - Pudong Chai Hangs Suffer Repeated Fires, Four Businesses Affected So Far</h3>
<p>In recent months, for unknown reasons, the chai hangs (firewood businesses) in Pudong have been successively suffering from fires. It is recorded that around 11:00 AM on November 8th of last year, the chai hang opened by local Jiang Afa at No. 1 Tiandu Road, Xiaoyangjing Temple East, Lan Ni Du, was completely destroyed by fire, which also spread to over ninety thatched sheds, causing a loss of over four thousand gold. Then, around 10:00 PM on November 10th, the chai hang of local Pan Shunchang, located west of Jiangjia Bridge in Shenjia Alley, also caught fire and was completely reduced to ashes, and spread to twelve tile houses, causing a loss of over five thousand gold. Furthermore, around 7:00 PM on December 3rd, the chai hang opened by local Jiang Ashi, located south of Jiangjia Bridge in Shenjia Alley, was burned down, with six piles of firewood destroyed, causing a loss of five to six hundred gold. After three chai hangs experienced fires within this one month, other chai hangs were also uneasy, as if disaster was about to befall them. Unexpectedly, just one month later, around 8:30 PM last night, a warehouse jointly rented by three chai hangs in Shenjia Alley, Xishiqiao Sanhe Yang South, suddenly caught fire. Because the weather was cold at that time and there were few pedestrians, no one noticed it for a while. When nearby residents discovered the fire, they urgently called for help, but it was too late. In an instant, it became a raging inferno. Director Yang of the Yangjiadu Police Station, upon receiving the report, telegraphed all fire departments for assistance. The Pudong Fire Brigade immediately rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. After a while, fire engines from the Yangjing District also arrived and surrounded the fire to put it out. However, because it happened to be low tide in the small river, there was a shortage of water, making it extremely difficult to draw water. After burning for over an hour, all thirteen or fourteen piles of reed firewood were completely engulfed in flames and could not be approached. The firefighters did their best to protect the surrounding houses and shipyards, but the flames were not easy to extinguish for a while. Therefore, the firefighters were prepared to work through the night to prevent the fire from reigniting. It was found that the base of the warehouse belonged to Cai Kaosheng, located on the west side. In recent years, Wu Qiushan from Hai Xing Road, Lan Ni Du; Pan A'da from the Police Station Road; and Pan Shunchang from Shenjia Alley jointly rented it from Cai for storing firewood. Among those burned down last night, Wu Qiushan's family suffered the greatest loss, amounting to over two thousand gold. The loss of Pan A'tian's family was estimated at six to seven hundred yuan, and Pan Shunchang's family suffered the smallest loss, estimated at over one hundred yuan. However, Pan Shunchang's family had already suffered a fire on the night of November 10th of last year, making this the second time they had suffered a disaster, which can be described as extremely unfortunate. After the fire was extinguished, Director Yang of the police station separately summoned each fire victim to the station for interrogation. However, it is still difficult to determine how the fire started.</p>
<h3>Communication Telegrams Fall Outside the Scope - No Need to Collect Additional Fees - Letter from the Directorate General of Telecommunications to the Shanghai Telegraph Office - Because it was Originally Established to Cultivate Joyful Use</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Office of the Ministry of Communications received an official letter from the Directorate General of Telecommunications of the Ministry of Communications regarding communication telegrams falling outside the scope, granting a concession.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to collect additional fees from the sender. The original letter stated: "Greetings. It has been found that the Ministry's promotion of communication telegrams was originally intended to cultivate the public's habit of using telegrams joyfully. However, because the sender is not familiar with the regulations, the content of the communication telegrams sent may inevitably fall outside the scope of communication telegrams. In the future, when receiving telegrams, each bureau's receiver should pay attention to avoid taking advantage and preventing abuses. However, for communication telegrams that have already been sent and received, if the receiving or relaying bureau finds that the content exceeds the scope, it only needs to notify the original sending bureau to pay attention or report to this Directorate for further instructions to pay attention. There is no need to telegraph the original sending bureau to collect additional fees from the sender according to the usual telegram rates in order to facilitate promotion and avoid misunderstandings. It is hoped that you will investigate and follow these instructions, and also instruct your subordinates to comply with them uniformly. This is addressed to the Shanghai Telegraph Office, from the Directorate General of Telecommunications."</p>
<h3>Xihu Highway - Coal-Powered Car Tested Yesterday - Very Safe Along the Route from Shanghai to Changshu - Speed of 42 Miles Can Replace Gasoline</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Xihu Highway, automobiles have been using imported gasoline. Wang Xiaolai, the general manager of the company, is extremely enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods. Knowing that domestically produced charcoal can also be used for driving, he immediately commissioned the Zhongming Factory to install charcoal-powered machinery. He tested the car with Tongxin brand charcoal yesterday, and the results were excellent, proving that charcoal can replace gasoline. If implemented nationwide, it would reduce gasoline leakage by fifty to sixty million dollars annually. The details of yesterday's test drive are as follows:</p>
<p>Safe and Fast Along the Way, Consumption is also Reduced. Because outsiders are quite skeptical about the effectiveness of charcoal-powered cars and whether they can outperform gasoline, the company specially conducted a test yesterday morning, supervised by Shi Menglan of the General Affairs Department and Zhu Zhongqian of the Engineering Department. At 7:15 AM yesterday morning, they drove the No. 18 passenger car from Shanghai to Changshu, carrying many passengers. The car traveled quite fast along the way. From beginning to end, the speed was between 32 and 38 miles. When driving to Zhitang, the speed reached 42 miles. At that time, the load was also extremely heavy. Such an achievement is truly gratifying. The charcoal used from Shanghai to Changshu was all produced by Tongxin, making it the most suitable for charcoal-powered cars. The charcoal consumption reached over forty catties, costing about one yuan. If gasoline were used, it would cost about three yuan, saving one-third of the cost.</p>
<p>All Will Be Converted to Charcoal in the Near Future. Recently, the company has decided to convert all sixty of its cars to burn charcoal, as the performance of these charcoal-powered cars is excellent, they are domestic products, and they can reduce consumption. It has already commissioned the Zhongming Factory to convert and install charcoal-powered oil replacement machinery. Ten cars have already been installed, and the remaining fifty will be installed successively in the coming days. In the shortest possible time, they can be completely converted to use charcoal.</p>
<h3>Inhumane - Abusing His Ex-Wife's Son - Speaking Out Against Injustice - Liu Shaozhuang Detained Pending Further Inquiry</h3>
<p>Liu Shaozhuang, from Hubei, lives at No. 5, Lane 29, Tangen Road. His first wife passed away more than two years ago, and he married a stepmother, Ms. Tan (from Guangdong), who works as a nurse at the Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital on Laobazi Road. Between November and December of last year, they jointly abused and beat Lu Yue, the seven-year-old son of his first wife, and Cui Ying, a twelve-year-old cousin living with them. Sometimes, the father would injure Lu Yue's head with a wooden clog and tie his hands and feet with ropes, hanging him on the clothesline pole on the sun deck overnight. They would confine him and Cui Ying in a wooden shed next to the sun deck, not allowing them to step beyond the threshold. The neighbors, having learned of the various hardships, confidentially informed the Hongkou Police Station the day before yesterday, and Chinese Detective Zhu Jihuang rushed to the address and made an arrest. Ms. Liu Tan had not returned from the Sanatorium Hospital, and only Liu Shaozhuang was arrested. He was quickly brought into the police station along with Lu Yue, Cui Ying, and a wooden clog. The girl was sent to the Jiliang Institute for care. The next morning, they were sent to the Special Court No. 1. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Bureau of Public Works, presented the case. Detective Zhu then explained the process of arresting the defendant and presented the wooden clog for inspection. Cui Ying and Lu Yue testified that the defendant and Ms. Tan often beat their heads, leaving obvious scars. Judge Xiao Xieffen questioned Liu Shaozhuang, but his answers were evasive. He ordered that he be remanded in custody and that the case be verified at a later date.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County's Efforts to Complete Public Works Construction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government is actively organizing various public works projects throughout its jurisdiction, and progress is being made rapidly. The details are described below. County electric lighting: Because it is located in the remote Beiqiao area, with excessive distances for road connections, the power supply is insufficient, and the light emission is very weak. After repeated consultations between County Magistrate Ye Zhendong and the Shanghai Municipal Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Minhang Zhenshen Electric Company, starting from the middle of January, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce is supplying electricity to Zhenshen. New electric poles have now been erected, and the transformers will soon be completed. Street lights will be widely installed in suitable locations to facilitate nighttime travel.</p>
<p>Water Supply Expected to be Completed by the End of the Month</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the residents in the newly governed Beiqiao area obtain their drinking water from rivers and ponds, which often causes malaria during the autumn season, to promote public health and the governance of Xin Zhi, an estimated cost of eight thousand yuan will be jointly borne by the court and the county. Currently, a budget is being prepared and submitted to the Construction Department for approval and allocation of funds to begin laying pipes. It is likely to be realized in a few months. In the future, the Sanatorium will sell water at a price of about eight yuan per ten thousand gallons. All Xin Zhi institutions, tea stoves, and food stores will be able to improve their drinking water, and it is hoped that malaria and epidemic diseases will no longer occur in the future.</p>
<p>Telephone Lines to be Installed Sequentially in Various Towns</p>
<p>Regarding the installation of telephone lines in various towns and townships in Pudong, the county is cooperating with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. Both parties have drafted a plan and submitted it to the Ministry for instructions, which may be approved for installation in the coming days. Therefore, there has been an increasing number of new houses built and residents moving in recently, and the area has gradually become prosperous. This is the result of County Magistrate Ye's diligent efforts in the half-year since taking office.</p>
<p>Worker Cuts Manager - Secret Discussion of Dismissal Unexpectedly Overheard - Once in Difficulty, Unexpectedly Injured Again</p>
<p>Huaxing Rubber Factory, located at No. 1116 Tangshan Road</p>
<h3>Relative of Nie Yuntai Donates Large Quantities of Jewelry and Houses - Flood Relief Association to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Disposal</h3>
<p>A certain Tai Madam, a Shanghai-based gentry of Hunan province, who is a relative of Mr. Nie Yuntai, considering the severe floods that occurred in various regions last year, has generously asked Mr. Nie to donate all of her houses, jewelry, utensils, antiques, and ornaments in Suzhou, worth millions, to the flood relief associations in various provinces for disaster relief. The relief associations, recognizing the importance of the matter, have dispatched a special representative to Suzhou to inspect and temporarily store the items. They have also scheduled a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Renji Hall Association at 4:00 PM tomorrow (the 14th) to discuss the reception and disposal methods. All presidents, vice-presidents, and directors and supervisors have been notified yesterday.</p>
<h3>Worker Blows Up and Injures Manager - Secret Discussion of Dismissal Unexpectedly Overheard - Once in Difficulty, Unexpectedly Injured Again</h3>
<p>Huaxing Rubber Factory, located at No. 1116 Tangshan Road, the factory owner is Wang Xinfu. Gu Genfu from Pudong was hired as the manager and also served as the factory director. The day before yesterday evening, Wang and Gu were discussing business plans and other matters in the factory. Inadvertently, they talked about the situation of the workers in the factory. At that time, Gu Genfu, seeing that the workers Tan Sanguang and Sun Xilin were lazy in their work and behaved improperly, proposed to Wang that they be dismissed and sought Wang's consent. Unexpectedly, the conversation was overheard by Tan Sanguang and Sun Xilin, who rushed into the manager's office on the spot, confronted Gu, and declared that if this action were implemented, it would bring serious disadvantages. After the factory owner intervened and mediated, they dispersed. However, Tan and Sun did not let go of their resentment. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, they waited at the factory gate, each carrying an axe and a handgun. When they saw Gu Genfu walking out of the factory gate, Tan Sanguang immediately drew his axe and slashed Gu's head and feet three times in a row. Gu Genfu, caught off guard, was unable to dodge and was injured and fell at the factory gate. Tan and Sun, seeing that their goal had been achieved, took the opportunity to escape. By the time the factory employees rushed out to chase them, it was too late. They quickly reported to the police station and sent Gu to the hospital for treatment, while sending detectives to search for the criminals in all directions.</p>
<h3>An Overview of China's Industry and Commerce Last Year - Except for the Silk Industry, the Rest Declined - Gradual Revival After the Implementation of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Last year, except for the silk and flour industries, which saw a slight turnaround, the production and sales of other industries in China all declined. Since the government implemented legal tender on November 4, foreign exchange rates have gradually stabilized, prices have risen, and various industries have gradually shown signs of prosperity. The Real Estate Agency reporter learned from Mr. He Bingxian, the former Director of the International Trade Bureau, about the state of China's industry and commerce last year, which is described in detail below:</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Industry in Extreme Decline - China's cotton spinning industry, after years of decline, experienced one of its worst years in over a decade this year. In terms of the yarn mill reduction rate, the yarn mill reduction rate in the first half of this year increased to 3.72 weeks. At the end of June, among the 91 Chinese-owned yarn mills nationwide, 24 mills were shut down and 14 mills were reduced in production, accounting for nearly 40%. The number of spindles in operation was 4,809,59 spindles, and the number of spindles shut down was 1,344,986 spindles. The reason for the large increase in production reduction and shutdowns in domestic yarn mills is due to the tightening of finance. The national cotton yarn production this year was 3,298,504 quintals of coarse yarn, 7,256,118 quintals of fine yarn, and 71.9 quintals of other yarn, totaling 4,095,645 quintals. Chinese-owned mills accounted for 68.90% of the total, Japanese-owned mills accounted for 30.2%, and British-owned mills accounted for 1%. The sales of yarn in Shanghai have recently been high due to inflation, but sales have been low, averaging more than 20,000 bales per month. Due to the implementation of production reduction and shutdowns this year, yarn stocks have decreased, but yarn prices have fallen instead. After the Ministry of Finance implemented Legal Tender, domestic cotton prices rose sharply, cotton production was poor, and the cotton price was greater than the profit rate of cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Active Exports in the Raw Silk Industry - Based on estimates of spring, autumn, and late autumn cocoon production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the estimated raw silk production should be 60,000 bales, an increase of 30% compared to last year. The start-up of silk mills varied from month to month. At the beginning of this year, there were only more than 20 mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After June, the number increased daily. In October, there were 38 mills in Shanghai, 41 mills in Wuxi, and 10 mills in Zhejiang, totaling 590 mills, with more than 24,000 silk reeling machines, which was the peak period of the year. By November, silk sales had gradually stagnated, and the mills stopped production one after another. At the end of November, there were only more than 50 mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The quantity of raw silk exported from Shanghai increased greatly compared to last year. The export volume in the first 11 months of this year reached 48,088 bales, an increase of more than two times. Exports from Guangdong decreased, reaching only 18,192 bales. Domestic sales of over 10,000 bales decreased by 50% compared to last year. However, the raw silk market this year has been greatly changed. The lowest price of medium-grade factory silk was 500 yuan per bale, and the highest price reached more than 900 yuan, which has not happened in recent times. Therefore, the raw silk industry this year has a real sense of vigorous development.</p>
<p>Flour Industry Remains Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Under the tightening of finance, the flour industry has remained relatively stable. In the first half of this year, the national flour production was 37,695,013 bags, an increase of 36% compared to last year. Production reduction and shutdowns were quite inconsistent, with 3 mills shutting down and 5 new mills opening. Sales were not bad. The national flour sales in the first half of this year were 39,50,255 bags, an increase of 18% compared to the same period last year. Market prices were considered stable, with the highest price of 3.13 yuan in November and the lowest price of 2.24 yuan in June.</p>
<p>Tea Industry Turns to Decline</p>
<p>The tea industry has turned to decline this year. Production in various regions has decreased compared to last year. Green tea decreased by 30%, with the Pingshui area decreasing to one-third. Red tea also had no increase. Comparing the exports in the first 10 months of this year with the same period last year, red tea decreased from 11,308,000 yuan to 6,734,000 yuan, and green tea decreased from 5,239,000 yuan to 11,976,000 yuan. The decrease in red tea exports is due to the increase in tea production in India and Ceylon. The decrease in green tea is due to the impact of Japanese tea sales in North Africa. The tea market has also decreased greatly compared to last year. In the second half of the year, the overall price gradually rose. With the outbreak of the Sino-Italian War, various foreign firms rushed to purchase, and the market price became firm.</p>
<p>Cement Industry is Not What it Used to Be</p>
<p>The cement industry's business is not as good as it used to be. Although production has not decreased, sales have decreased, and prices have also fallen. The national production this year totaled 3,770,000 barrels, an increase of 360,000 barrels compared to last year. Except for the increase of 720,000 barrels by the Guangdong Cement Factory, there were no changes in other factories. The sales of the China Cement Company and the Huashang Cement Company are the same as the production volume, and there is no inventory. The Qixin Cement Company has an inventory of 500,000 to 600,000 barrels. Market prices have fallen greatly compared to last year, resulting in some cement factories that had net profits last year suffering losses this year or only being able to pay official interest without dividends.</p>
<p>Match Industry has Wider Sales</p>
<p>The match industry this year is roughly similar to last year. The production in the first six months of this year was 360,703 boxes, an increase of 13% compared to the same period last year. Among them, safety matches accounted for 135,166 boxes, and sulfide matches accounted for 225,547 boxes. The Shanghai Huaming Match Factory and the Dahua Match Factory were shut down. The production reduction varied among factories. There were four new factories opened. Sales were 199,855 boxes, an increase of 9% compared to last year. Among them, safety match sales were 148,222 boxes, and sulfurized phosphorus match sales were 199,855 boxes. Market prices showed a gradual downward trend. In October, in order to stabilize match prices, various industries jointly raised prices by 3 yuan per box of legal tender. In November, prices were raised by another 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Coal Mining Industry Increases Production</p>
<p>The total annual production is estimated to be over 12 million tons, of which about 10.6 million tons are bituminous coal and about 1.5 million tons are anthracite coal. The mining areas with production exceeding 1 million tons include Kailuan, Zhongxing, Boshan, Ludu, etc., and the Liuhegou, Pingxiang, and Jingxing mines each produce 600,000 to 700,000 tons. The total sales for the year are 902,000 tons. Production exceeded sales by 758,000 tons. Market prices in the first ten months showed a downward trend compared to the same period last year. In November, there was a slight recovery.</p>
<p>Rubber Industry also Shows Decline</p>
<p>The rubber industry declined compared to last year, with one new factory opening and five factories shutting down. The main products were various sneakers and hot water bottles. Among them, the production volume of automobile tires manufactured by Greater China Manufacturing decreased this year. The market situation was greatly declining in the first half of the year and gradually recovered in the second half of the year. According to surveys, compared to the same period last year, the price of rubber shoes in the first half of this year fell by 15%, and the price of sneakers fell by 20%. The price only recovered to 10% of the original price in the second half of the year. Bicycle tires and rickshaw tires showed a slight improvement due to increased tariffs. The automotive tire tariff has not been increased, and the business is not good. It is reported that Greater China lost more than 300,000 yuan in the production of automobile tires this year.</p>
<h3>Conspiring to Commit Robbery in a Hotel - Seven Robbers Arrested - Sent to Court This Morning for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Police Station received a tip around 3:00 AM yesterday, stating that several robbers were hiding in a hotel at No. 21, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession, hoping to commit robbery, etc. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address and arrested five bandits, including Cai Akang, Li Binggen, Rong Akang, Liu Yucheng, and Wang A'gen, in the hotel, and seized a fake pistol. As they were being escorted away, they suddenly saw two men peering into the room where the robbers were staying. The detectives turned back and interrogated them. The two men were evasive and tried to escape, so they were also arrested by the detectives and escorted to the police station. According to their statements, they were Ge Shanqing and Gong Debiao, and they were indeed accomplices of the five bandits previously arrested. It was also learned that they had committed robbery cases in the Huishan District. Therefore, they were all temporarily detained and will be sent to court for investigation this morning.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Audits, Finds Discrepancies in Accounts of the Compensation Coordination Association - Requests Allocation of Incentive Funds for Protected Households, Orders Negotiation with the Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the fire insurance relief funds incident in the Zhabei disaster area, the Social Affairs Bureau, after registering the protected households and starting to distribute funds last winter, re-registered due to the large number of those who had not yet received funds. The previous Claims Association had decided to pay incentive funds for protected households and travel expenses for claim personnel at the large meeting of protected households. Therefore, it requested the Social Affairs Bureau to allocate the funds. The Social Affairs Bureau replied with Bureau Letter No. 12681 yesterday, stating, "One item is a request to promptly allocate incentive funds for protected households and travel expenses for claim personnel, so as to distribute them and facilitate the conclusion. After reviewing the matter, it was found that the previous Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Association for the disaster area received 20,000 yuan in relief funds in February of last year. According to the reported accounts, after auditing, there are many discrepancies, and there are still remaining funds. If what you claim is true, you should directly negotiate with them to receive the funds. After receiving the order, the association has contacted the Coordination Association to receive the funds."</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications - Overview of Trust Deposits Received</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Head Office of the Bank of Communications is now offering trust deposit services, and the number of deposits received in recent days has been quite enthusiastic. One type of ordinary trust deposit is actually similar to dividend savings in nature, but the method is more convenient. It is stipulated that an account can be opened from 50 yuan. After the deposit is held for one year, the earned profits can be withdrawn at any time. In addition to extracting a small amount of trust fees, the bank will allow the depositors to enjoy the full amount without being restricted by the fixed interest rate of the deposit.</p>
<h3>Zhanyuan Buddhist Association - Adds粥間 to Soup Kitchen</h3>
<p>The Zhanyuan Buddhist Association on Anaqin Road in the French Concession has spared no effort in carrying out charitable causes over the years. This winter, it is still following the old practice of setting up a soup kitchen in the Shaoxing Guild Hall in Xieqiao, which began distributing soup on January 2nd. This area is a gathering place for the hard-working poor. During the severe cold of winter, the suffering compatriots, upon hearing of the opening of the soup kitchen, cheered and clamored, carrying pots and utensils to receive soup. The number of people receiving soup daily has been increasing, currently reaching seven to eight thousand every morning, and soon it will reach ten thousand. Because there is less soup than people, those who arrive later are given white rice. Although the rice can also fill their stomachs, considering the inconvenience of cooking for those who receive rice, the association has specially added three soup kitchens and two stoves in the vacant space behind the original site, so that more hot soup can be cooked, totaling forty urns, in order to distribute the soup according to names, so as to benefit the common people.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County - Agricultural Warehouse to be Relocated to Zhuanqiao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Agricultural Warehouse's Management Committee has been organized and established, and it has been decided to first establish a county warehouse in Beiqiao and to use the remaining houses of the Town God's Temple. After careful investigation, it was found that Beiqiao did not have a strong need, and the houses of the temple were also unsuitable. Therefore, the Management Committee convened a second meeting yesterday to select another location and plan the project. After Chairman Ye Zhendong reported, the following resolutions were discussed and decided: Committee Member Shan Zhigang has been transferred and has no time to take care of the warehouse. Zhang Yimou was elected to succeed him. Committee Member Zhang Yimou was elected as the director of the audit section. Two clerks will be set up, one for general affairs and one for auditing, to be concurrently held by staff from the County Government's Agricultural Affairs Office. The association's budget will be drafted by the general affairs section, submitted to the general assembly for review, and then forwarded to the county government to be spent within the construction funds by applying to the Ministry of Finance. It was decided that the county warehouse will be located in Zhuanqiao, directly under the jurisdiction of the association. After the location and drawings are determined by the association, the local people will provide funds to build the warehouse and sign a contract with the association stipulating the lease method. The budget for operating expenses will be drafted by the association and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The warehouse business will be handled by the Farmers Bank on behalf of the association.</p>

At 11 AM on the 10th, he went to the Xinglong Inn at No. 142 West Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, ostensibly to rent Room 8. He ingested poison with the intention of ending his life. It wasn't until 6 PM that the tea attendant noticed he wasn't responding to calls and reported it to the French police, who transported him to Renji Hospital. The poisoning was severe, and despite attempts to save him, he died at 11 PM that night. The hospital notified the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. The next day, a report was filed with the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the hall and determined that the deceased had indeed died from ingesting poison.

<h3>Hou Lin'an Kidnaps a Child and Hides Him; Police Prosecute for Abduction</h3>
<p>Yu Ni, a Ningbo woman and housewife of a steamed bun shop at Nos. 34 and 36 Huacheng Road in the French Concession, also known as Ni Heying, thirty-one years old, gave birth to twin boys, the elder named A'da and the younger named A'er, both four years old this year. The two brothers often played in front of and behind the shop. Around 4 PM on December 28 of last year, the two young brothers were playing outside the back door when A'da suddenly disappeared. A search was conducted everywhere, but he could not be found. That night, a girl from a neighboring family named Zhao Di told them that A'da had been taken away by Hou Lin'an (33 years old, from Changzhou, formerly a cook, recently unemployed), whom they knew. Ms. Yu reported the matter to the French police and requested an investigation, but there was no way to arrest him. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, relatives of Ms. Yu's neighbor were riding a tram and got off at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Hairan Road when they happened to see Hou Lin'an carrying a teapot to a tiger stove to get hot water. They used a plan to lure Hou to Ms. Yu's house, where they were arrested by the French police. It was then revealed by the police head that the child was being hidden in the Aihua Inn on North Zhejiang Road. The police dispatched detectives Wu Yuren to go to the inn with the public police, where they rescued the child and brought him back to the police station, first handing him over to his family. The police then sent Hou to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. The other day, Judge Xiong Hui opened the First Criminal Division and interrogated Hou Lin'an, and the police attorney, Yuan Jiahuang, stated the case and prosecuted him for luring a man under the age of twenty away from his guardian. Hou Lin'an confessed that he hid the plaintiff's child and demanded a reward because he was in dire straits and did not dare to sell him. After verifying the confession in court, he declared the defense closed and awaited the scheduled verdict. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Spring Ploughing Lane Tenants Request Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>The houses in Spring Ploughing Lane are located between Rue Edouard VII and Rue Massenet. The owner is the wealthy merchant Zhou Weishi. There are over a hundred residential buildings, housing nearly a hundred families. Due to the recent severe business downturn, rent reductions have been implemented in various places and neighboring areas, with documented cases and precedents. Therefore, after repeated collective discussions, a Rent Reduction Committee was formed, with Shen Baoyi, Qiu Pinsan, Tu Fuzhang, Huang Musen, Du Xintian, Liu Ping, Lin Shiliang, Dai Zhenyang, Shao Shoumei, Zhu Cheng, and Liu Xiantang elected as eleven representatives responsible for handling the matter. A legal advisor was also engaged to prepare everything. The letter from the committee's representatives to the landlord requesting a rent reduction is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, given the current severe economic situation and the widespread rent reductions, the tenants held a meeting on December 30th of last year and prepared a public letter with all seals affixed, earnestly requesting that you, the esteemed landlord, consider the difficulties of business and reduce rent by 30% across the board from October of last year. At the same time, the general meeting resolved to establish a Rent Reduction Committee, elect representatives, and report to higher-level organizations and agencies. However, many days have passed without a response, causing great anticipation among the tenants. It is noted that the neighboring houses in the same area have already implemented rent reductions since July or August of last year, with documented cases and precedents. Furthermore, social and economic instability and global unrest are affecting the entire world and our country, and Shanghai as a whole cannot avoid these impacts. Therefore, even if there are rental contracts in place, lawsuits can still lead to mutual understanding in light of these widespread rent reductions. Landlords and tenants share a common interest and are bound together. They should share both good fortune and misfortune. How can one seek individual prosperity while others suffer? Moreover, the law is based on human sentiment, and human sentiment is based on facts. Although some tenants may have rental contracts, their situation should not be uniquely different from others in Spring Ploughing Lane who are facing unavoidable circumstances. Therefore, the general meeting decided, and the committee reiterated, that for the sake of mutual relations and overall consideration, each household will deposit the owed rent into a bank to protect the landlord's interests while awaiting a proper resolution. To this end, the committee has appointed Shen Baoyi, Qiu Pinsan, Huang Musen, Tu Fuzhang, Shao Shoumei, and Liu Ping as full representatives of all tenants, to present factual diagrams of rent reductions in nearby neighborhoods and rent comparison tables, and to earnestly request that you, the esteemed landlord, break with precedent, show compassion for the tenants, and grant the request to avoid extreme measures and mutual harm, so that rent payments can be made smoothly. This resolution has been recorded. Therefore, based on the situation, representatives have been dispatched with this letter to request a meeting at your convenience, so that your benevolent intentions can be announced at the general meeting. A written response is also hoped for.</p>

<h3>Medical Field</h3>
<p>The Gospel for those who are physically weak to quit smoking: Everyone knows the harm of opium. In this period of strict smoking prohibition, there are still some gentlemen who are physically weak who are worried about quitting smoking. Examining the reasons, although it is due to a lack of firm will, there are indeed many people who quit smoking because they are too sick to bear it. If you want to find a good method and a good doctor, you will get nothing. It is very sad to wander on a fork in the road. It is heard that the hypnosis suggestion technique used by European and American doctors in modern times has the effect of correcting psychology and treating diseases. Therefore, it has a miraculous effect on quitting smoking. Li Shaoguang, a famous spiritual therapist in this city, has been practicing this technique for many years and has achieved remarkable results. A certain Mr. Wei used to smoke opium for eight years, and he could not do without five qian a day. After only fifteen treatments by Dr. Li, he quit in one month without any pain. Recently, a certain Mr. Qian from Zhejiang was worried and sick, which caused him to become addicted to opium. He originally hoped to forget his worries by swallowing clouds and spitting fog. When the smoke power was rising, he would also suddenly think about it. However, he knew that the deeper he was poisoned, the weaker his mind and body would become. He realized that the harm outweighed the benefits. Therefore, every time he used needles and medicine to quit, he would develop symptoms such as coughing up blood, shortness of breath, and insomnia. He interrupted again and again, and it was difficult to recover. Later, he heard about Li's name and went to see him from thousands of miles away. Li used the most peaceful hypnosis method to gradually reduce the amount of smoking while treating the disease. He was able to safely quit in less than half a month. According to Mr. Qian, the fact that he was able to avoid old illnesses during the smoking cessation period was unprecedented. He was very happy and indescribable. He returned to his hometown yesterday and praised Li Jun as a miraculous doctor, who is indeed the lucky star for those who are physically weak to quit smoking. Li lives at 41 Huayuanfang, Jinshenjiao Road.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>Respectfully, I read the news in your newspaper on January 12, entitled "Many People Ask About Suicide in Hotel Room." After investigation, the head of the family, Wu Gongwenqin, came to Shanghai from Suzhou on the 9th of this month and stayed at the Xinhuizhong Hotel on Sanma Road. On the morning of the 11th, he actually suffered from cerebral hemorrhage. The porter discovered this and reported it to the Old Zhabei Police Station, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment but he died. The information in your newspaper about death by poisoning is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am sincerely afraid that relatives and friends from afar will investigate. I urgently hope that you will correct it. Sincerely, Wu's Funeral Committee, January 12</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Football Trial Match: Chinese Team Suffers Crushing Defeat to Western Union Yesterday; 6-1 Sets New Record for Eastern China's Crushing Defeat; Penalty Kick Avoids Total Annihilation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match has been scheduled to take place in Shanghai on the Lunar New Year's Day. Yesterday, the Eastern China and Western Union teams held a trial match at Shen Garden. Eastern China suffered an unbearable 6-1 defeat. Western Union took the lead by one goal to nil in the first half. Eastern China only scored a penalty kick, otherwise the entire team would have been defeated. Western Union's overall technique, the essence of Westerners, is above that of Eastern China. Eastern China's entire line was in extreme disarray in the second half. The 6-1 final score was a lucky escape. The audience was not crowded, only four or five thousand people.</p>
<p>Eastern China Pale in Comparison</p>
<p>Western Union's five forwards were extraordinary, constantly threatening Eastern China. Collas and Bowser ran the entire field, and their wings seemed to be better than Cao and Jia. Center forward Hough was a dangerous figure standing in front of the goal. Among the Chinese players, Sun Jinshun might be able to compete with Hough for the position of center forward. There are not many hopes for other players. The Qianbao system in the midfield was temporarily added. The only flaws in Western Union were the two fullbacks. Eastern China's teamwork was shattered yesterday, making it impossible to show any strength. Xu Ting's goalkeeping was weak, and Li Ning was busy elsewhere. Feng Yunyou was still good, and Chen Jiaqiu, who had been away from the field for a long time, still had his former glory. Among the forwards, only Sun and Cao were worth mentioning. The lineups of the two sides yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>Western Union</p>
<p>Bassezhong</p>
<p>G. Jack, Victor</p>
<p>Baxiot, Costas, Remydi</p>
<p>Little Walter, Bowser, Hough, Collas, Fuen</p>
<p>Eastern China Lineup</p>
<p>Xu Heng</p>
<p>Li Ning, Guan Xun'an</p>
<p>Gu Shangqin, Feng Yunyou, Zhou Guangzhong</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Li Yichen, Sun Jinshun, Chen Jiaqiu, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Iron Leg Scores Penalty</p>
<p>Eastern China kicked off, and Chen Jiaqiu, whose qualification had been restored, showed a very active start. As soon as the whistle sounded, Eastern China launched a major attack. Sun Jinshun approached the goal, and Cao Qiuting shot fiercely, but was lightly saved by Bao Saizhong. Youliang attacked the goal again, but the ball went too high. Li Yichen attacked for the third time, but was saved by Victor again. All good opportunities were wasted. The four seats regretted it. Collas got the ball and attacked, but was intercepted by Yunyou halfway. The ball reached Youliang's feet, and he passed it in. Qiuting attacked again, and Bassezhong sent it to Gang Hou. Youliang took a corner kick, and Western merchant Jack, who was guest starring, fouled in front of the line. Iron Leg scored a penalty kick, and Eastern China took the lead. It was only five minutes.</p>
<p>Good Opportunity Lost Again and Again</p>
<p>Western Union counterattacked, with great momentum, approaching Eastern China directly. Collas intercepted a ball on the left and was about to shoot at the goal, but he didn't even kick the ball. Gu Shang was very happy for Eastern China. Gu Shangqin got the ball and moved forward. Victor pushed him from behind and was penalized for teaching the ball. It was sent directly to the goal, but Jia Youliang flew it far away. Sun Jinshun had the same ball as Collas in front of the goal, but also kicked it outside the post. Eastern China missed two great opportunities. Then, in a turn, Hough passed to Little Walter, and he scored, making it one to one.</p>
<p>Trailing 1-3</p>
<p>From then on, Western Union's momentum turned stronger, hovering in front of Eastern China's goal. Bowser got a pass from Hough and kicked a high ball. Xu Heng relied on his volleyball skills and flicked it with his hand, but he flicked it into the goal. The so-called bad luck with the ball is like this. Jie Mei Huater shot fiercely on a diagonal line more than twenty yards from the goal, flying like an arrow and hitting the target again. Eastern China was at a disadvantage with a score of 3-1 in the first half.</p>
<p>Turned into a Complete Rout</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu originally played as a right midfielder, determined to counterattack, and switched to the front, but in the second half, there were only five minutes of offensive. In front of the Western Union goal, Sun Jinshun raised his iron leg in the midst of the chaos, but Kazi hit the goal post again, and sighed. After twenty minutes of mutual attack like this, Fuenjie made a rapid advance, and Western Union's five tigers came like overwhelming mountains and seas. Hough kicked it in, and Xu Heng was stunned like a wooden chicken. Five minutes later, Baxiot headed it in. Xu Heng fell to the ground and hugged the ball, but Collas did not let go and kicked the ball, making it 5-1. The Eastern China army had no will to fight and was in a state of disarray. Hough attacked the goal, and Zhang Jinhai actually scored an own goal. The final score was 6-1.</p>

<h3>Little Men</h3>
<p>— Louisa M. Alcott (150) Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Neta fled quickly, looking like a drowned rat. This temporary bath he enjoyed was clearly beneficial to him, because from then on, he respected both of them very much, and his curiosity seemed to flow away with the stream. After he had gone far away, Don jumped over the wall and saw that Ned was lying down, very tired, as if he was almost overwhelmed by troubles.</p>
<p>"He won't bother you again, I think. If he comes again, just tell me, and I'll deal with him," Don said, trying to calm himself down.</p>
<p>"I don't really care what others say about me. I'm used to it," Ned said sadly, "But I hate it when others attack you."</p>
<p>"How do you know he's wrong?" Don asked, turning his face away.</p>
<p>"What, are you talking about that money?" Ned exclaimed, looking up in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"But I don't believe it! You don't love money; all you want are some earthworms and things like that," Ned said with a smile, indicating that it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>"I need a butterfly net, as urgently as you need a violin; so how could I steal that money?" Don said, still turning his head away, busily poking holes in a pile of sod with his little trick.</p>

<h3>1935 World Economic Review</h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>— Analysis of Three Major Characteristics —</p>
<p>The characteristics of the world economy in 1935 were manifested in three issues. First, the collapse of the American N.R.A. (National Industrial Recovery Act) in May. Second, the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War in Europe in October. Third, the abandonment of the silver standard in China in the Far East in November. These three issues all have profound significance. Although the regions and content of their occurrences are different, if we observe each of these issues as a part of the world capitalist economy, then the analysis of these three issues can reveal the stage in history to which the world capitalist economy progressed in 1935.</p>
<p>(1) The Lessons of the Collapse of the American N.R.A.</p>
<p>What role did the collapse of the American N.R.A. play in the world economy of 1935, and what historical significance did it have? This can be explained in the following points:</p>
<p>First, judging from the performance of the N.R.A. during the two years of its implementation, we can see how deceitful the dreams of ordinary scholars and capitalists, the so-called [planned economy] of capitalism, really were. Second, the planned economy of capitalism is only a temporary measure to prevent the shaking of the existing social order, to save it from the crisis of collapse, and even to increase the capital profits of capitalists. This method does not stimulate or cause a positive economic recovery or boom. It merely temporarily shifts the stage of social economic [panic] to the stage of [depression], and cannot reach the stage of [prosperity].</p>
<p>Third, the social fascist politics that arise to resolve this economic contradiction in the process of panic are very weak in their power to solve actual economic problems.</p>
<p>Following the failure of the N.R.A., various movements occurred in the United States, such as the so-called [redistribution of wealth] represented by Coughlin, which was considered extreme. However, the peaceful revolution movement of the capitalists was ultimately a fleeting illusion. Italy swiftly opened the curtain of war first. Hitler in Germany greatly expanded his armaments and was already fully disguised behind the scenes. Japan, wearing the mask of East Asian peace, carried out aggression against China. These factors fundamentally shook the stability of the capitalist economic structure, forcing the forces represented by the N.R.A., which were intended to maintain the existing economic structure, to move further towards extreme paths. This path is the inevitable destination of the transition from the [planned economy] of capitalist politics in various countries to the [military] controlled economy.</p>
<p>This tendency matured in 1935 and is bound to intensify into a torrential flood in 1936. The peaceful planned economy, previously referred to as a [bloodless revolution], was tantamount to dividing up the qualitative changes and merely providing a foundation for the military-controlled economy of war. As a result, the peaceful plan, which was originally intended to save the economic crisis of capitalism, would inevitably be transformed into a second world war that exposes the contradictions of capitalism and seeks a final solution.</p>
<p>The American N.R.A. experiment and its failure can serve as a basis for understanding the role of the so-called [capitalist planned economy], the highest function of capitalism. The entire result of the American implementation is nothing more than: (1) the deceitfulness of this planned economy, (2) its inability to put the economy on the normal track of prosperity, and (3) instead, it further stimulated the rise of a more right-wing politics that opposed the N.R.A. The N.R.A. raised the banner of socialism, with attractive slogans such as shortening working hours, increasing wages, and reducing unemployment. At first, it did cause some terror and unease among some foolish capitalists, and it gained the joy and support of some workers. Scholars around the world also believed that the ideal socialist system was gradually being realized in the United States, and that there was now a second path different from the Soviet Union for transforming the world's social economy. What was the reality?</p>
<p>The two years of American experiments have been clearly presented to us. Has the N.R.A. ever adjusted the original labor-capital relations, and has it ever improved the lives of the American masses?</p>
<p>In the first-quarter report of Varga's annual report in 1935, a special section was set up for the N.R.A. and a correct analysis was made. One section stated:</p>
<p>The intention of Article 7 in the N.R.A. (the so-called labor clause) was only due to the collapse of the banking credit system and the dissatisfaction of agricultural workers, which increased unrest. Capitalists used this bill to carry out their currency inflation policy and to rescue the bankruptcy of various enterprises, using the huge funds in the national treasury to assist their own interests. Therefore, some large capitalists at times suppressed those who opposed the N.R.A., only wanting the rights of workers to strike and go on strike to be abolished, which would be satisfactory. This was not without reason. [However, due to the implementation of the N.R.A., in many cases, some capitalists ultimately suffered great losses. As a result, many capitalists soon openly resisted the bill. The judgment of the Supreme Court, which represented their will, represented their opposition.]</p>
<p>[The N.R.A. was originally only a comfort and mitigation for the struggle for survival of the masses. Some parts were useful to capitalists, such as regulations on monopolistic prices and the lifting of anti-trust laws, which were almost all implemented. Only Article 7, which was unfavorable to them, was not implemented for a long time. Later, the issues of the Labor Federation and collective bargaining rights were still dealt with by clever deception.]</p>
<p>For example, for those who suffered losses due to the shortening of working hours and the increase in wages, there was even less of a way out. Even the lives of employed workers deteriorated due to the rise in prices. This can be seen from the frequent general strikes of the American Federation of Labor in the past two years.</p>
<p>After some clauses of the N.R.A. that were useful to capitalists were completed, and only those clauses that were unfavorable to them remained, the bill was bound to be severely attacked and even abolished. The Supreme Court's judgment was when the bill had been gnawed clean of the flesh by the big capitalists, leaving only the bones. As Huerga quoted the New York Times' comment at the time: [The Supreme Court's judgment on the N.R.A. was fortunate to be delayed until this time. If it had been at a time when the N.R.A. was being hoped for, this judgment would have been harmful to all parties. Now, the bill has completed its mission and lost its function. The judges are merely declaring the death of something that everyone has already recognized as dead.]</p>
<p>Let us look at the actual situation again. Who actually benefited from the N.R.A.? According to a survey by the International Bank, the operating financial report of the largest American joint-stock company, which holds approximately 1,500 factories and stores, showed that the company had a debt of 97 million yuan in 1932, but in 1933 it had a net profit of 640 million yuan. In 1934, the net profit for that year increased to 1.05 billion yuan. What does this indicate?</p>
<p>In contrast, the lives of these producers did not improve much. Although the proportion of unemployed workers joining the Labor Federation decreased slightly, the number of employed workers in all factories increased very little. This can be seen from the fact that the number was less than in 1930. The detailed situation is briefly as follows:</p>
<p>Employment and Unemployment Statistics in the United States in Recent Years (Base 100 in 1923-25)</p>
<p>In January 1935, although it had recovered to 91 compared to 64 in 1932, even so, it still could not catch up with 96 in 1930 (the second year of the panic). In August 1935, it decreased to 86 again. Although there are no figures for the last few months, due to the severity of the European and Far Eastern issues, it is feared that the index will fall further. The recent soaring of prices and stock prices in the United States is due to the expectation that a new currency inflation policy is about to be implemented (even so, it still cannot catch up with 1930). If people only observe the surface, thinking that the United States has truly overcome the recession, they only need to look at the production index to know how unstable the economic foundation of the United States is.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is not mysterious. It is simply a normal contradiction of the capitalist economy. It raises the level of production technology and means to a very high level, but the existing economic structure no longer has room for its development (mainly the exhaustion of purchasing power and markets), inevitably limiting its proper growth and plunging it into panic. For example, the cotton spinning industry in Japan recently suffered the same crisis, the main reason being the high degree of development of production technology, which led to a contradiction with actual needs.</p>
<p>The implementation and failure of the N.R.A., although it only seems to be a problem in the United States, can be used to represent and expose the essence of the so-called capitalist planned economy in all other countries—a trend that once set off the biggest storm in the world economy in 1935 and was believed in by many people.</p>
<p>(2) The Italo-Ethiopian War and the World Economy</p>
<p>It is a great mistake to regard the Italo-Ethiopian War as merely a matter between Italy and Abyssinia. The Italo-Ethiopian War not only has world historical significance, but also fully exposes the stage to which the world capitalist economy has progressed today. The Italo-Ethiopian War is a microcosm of the struggle of various forces on the entire globe. Political, economic, and diplomatic struggles from all aspects are crystallized in this war and will spread out from this war.</p>
<p>The most important lesson of the Italo-Ethiopian War is how powerless the political forces that maintain world peace, most concretely realized in the so-called League of Nations, are. At the same time, due to the Italo-Ethiopian War, we see that the capitalist countries are rubbing their hands and eager to try for war. The curtain of the Second World War is about to be unveiled imminently.</p>
<p>Naturally, the underlying instigator or promoter behind the scenes is still the world economic panic that has solidified from existing contradictions. Some phenomena have political or diplomatic factors, and some people think that these are political or diplomatic problems, which naturally completely distorts the nature of the problem. The Italo-Ethiopian War is just like that.</p>
<p>The world economic panic came to an end in 1932. After 1932, it gradually progressed from [panic] to the cycle of [depression]. This cannot be said to be a recovery. At any time, it is still stagnating in the stage of recession. Why can't it progress from [depression] to [prosperity]? That is because it is dominated by the fundamental laws of the capitalist economy. Simply put, it is that the social relations that created its occurrence limit its development.</p>
<p>Even the transition from [panic] to [depression] is not due to normal economic growth. We see that the production index of various countries has risen slightly in recent years, but the biggest reason for this rise is not the expansion of demand, but the deepening of the arms race caused by international political unrest, and thus comes this [gunpowder-scented] boom. This gunpowder-scented boom is formed in two aspects.</p>
<p>First, it is the direct development of the military industry. Second, it is the promotion of the domestic food self-sufficiency policy. In other words, both are nothing more than preparation for war. The biggest component of the increase in the production of various countries in 1935 came from war preparation.</p>
<p>We only need to see that the production index of various countries has increased considerably, but international trade has not developed proportionally. Thus, we can know what kind of nature this boom is.</p>
<p>The implementation of the food self-sufficiency policy makes the agricultural products of the countries that implement this policy expensive. On the one hand, it stimulates the agriculture of the country, but at the same time, it reduces the exports of agricultural countries and puts them in a serious predicament. As a result, agricultural countries will inevitably reduce their purchasing power for imported industrial products and have difficulty paying debts. The result will inevitably lead to the strengthening of foreign exchange control, which will severely hit industrial product exporting countries. As a result, even the sprouts of some booms will inevitably be destroyed immediately.</p>
<p>If international trade is sluggish, the world economy, even if there is a partial recovery, cannot recover as a whole. This was not only true in 1935, but it has been the case since 1933. However, in 1935, political unrest further aggravated this crisis. The Italo-Ethiopian War is a manifestation of this relationship.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Italo-Ethiopian War shows the development of the world's re-division of colonial territories. Generally speaking, the countries that have won in the colonial competition, that is, the countries that have the most colonies, feel the threat of the world economic panic more than those capitalist countries that have fewer colonies. For example, the reason why Britain, France, and the United States were able to transform the panic into a [depression] is mainly due to the large number of colonies. When they feel the threat of the world economic panic, they intensify the exploitation of their colonies, shifting the burden of the panic to their colonies. Therefore, they can not only be fearless, but also improve their situation.</p>
<p>However, countries that have lagged behind or are newcomers in the previous colonial division war feel unable to cope with the serious world economic panic. In order to maintain the status quo of society, they can only strengthen dictatorial politics to stabilize domestic order for a time. However, this is only a stimulant and cannot last long. When they are threatened by the crisis for the second time, they can only seek the remedy of colonies.</p>
<p>However, the important parts of the world's colonies already have owners. The new countries in the colonial war can only turn their attention to places where the powers are weaker to develop. This is why Italy chose Abyssinia.</p>
<p>During the same period, the Italo-Ethiopian War and Japan's war against China are the same in principle. However, the Italo-Ethiopian War caused such serious international disputes, while the powers seemed to be watching Japan's development in Manchuria and North China with their arms folded. There is a reason for this, because there are some differences between the two situations:</p>
<p>First, China and Japan are located in the Far East, and there is a great geographical distance from the European and American powers, making direct intervention more inconvenient. Therefore, within a certain range, the development of Japanese power is acceptable to the powers, unlike Abyssinia, which has a close relationship with the power of the powers.</p>
<p>Second, the Soviet Union, which is regarded as a monster in the world, is a common enemy of capitalist countries. Japan uses the pretext of defending the Soviet Union's power to please various countries.</p>
<p>Third, Japan's slogan is East Asian peace, while Italy publicly declares its crusade against Ethiopia. This not only concerns the face of the League of Nations, but its boldness is even more embarrassing for the powers.</p>
<p>In addition, the Italo-Ethiopian War not only shows the difficulty of maintaining the world capitalist economy today and the deepening of the crisis of clearing this contradiction through war, but also shows what kind of path the highest development of the extremely right-wing politics corresponding to this economy has taken.</p>
<p>(3) The Significance of China's Currency Reform</p>
<p>The collapse of the N.R.A. is the prelude to the domestic trends of capitalist countries, the Italo-Ethiopian War is the initial form of international disputes between capitalist countries, and China's currency reform is a change in the economy of colonies or semi-colonies as sacrifices of capitalist countries. The three combined can fully reveal the characteristics of the world economy in 1935.</p>
<p>The most important reason for China's abandonment of the silver standard is naturally to thank the cruel gift of the American silver policy. Although this currency change is called reform, if the word reform is interpreted with a positive meaning, it is not the case at all. The so-called reform is actually nothing more than the panic and decline of China's silver standard currency. Just like the gold standard countries that had to abandon the gold standard not long ago due to the outflow of gold, China had to declare separation from the silver standard in the same situation.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the remnants of this currency panic, China has repeatedly pleaded with the [gentlemen] of the United States to change the silver policy. However, the compassionate gentlemen of Wall Street would not turn their eyes even if they squeezed the oil out of the 400 million poor people in China for their own [profits].</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to blame the gentlemen of Wall Street, because the nature of capitalism is such a cruel thing. However, in recent decades, it is rare to see such a cruel achievement as the American silver group destroying China's original monetary system at once.</p>
<p>British capital took this opportunity, through the mediation of Roth, to try to swallow China's currency power. This shows that there are fewer and fewer things to carve up in the world colonial war, and no one will let go of China, a piece of meat that is thin but very large.</p>
<p>After China's currency reform, the economic wars between Britain and Japan in the Far East will inevitably escalate. As a result, a group of dogs will compete for a piece of meat. After eating the meat, they will further bite the bones—this is China's current fate in the colonial war of the powers.</p>
<p>Naturally, in a strict sense, it is somewhat excessive to say that China's abandonment of the silver standard is entirely due to the American silver policy. Of course, there are many other factors. Among these many factors, the main one cannot but be the financial difficulties. This is of great importance from a world point of view. Secondly, the North China issue was created by taking currency reform as a pretext. These changes all indicate the deepening of the imperialist aggression against China.</p>
<p>In 1935, the shadow of the imperialist claws had reached all sectors of China. The cruel tragedy will inevitably be staged one scene after another in 1936. [Roar, China!] It is just the time!</p>
<h3>World Oil War</h3>
<p>— (He Bing)</p>
<p>The Oil Industry in the Gunpowder Boom</p>
<p>Since Italy opened the curtain of war, the all-out martial arts masterpiece that the powers have been rehearsing behind the scenes for a long time has a tendency to be staged immediately. At that time, various important military industries, which serve as tools for this martial arts drama, will inevitably receive special attention. From the lessons learned from the First World War, the oil issue has become one of the focuses of attention. Since gentlemen from countries such as Britain and France proposed the slogan of economic blockade against Italy in the League of Nations assembly hall, the oil ban has become a serious issue. International oil trusts, like munitions merchants, have taken the opportunity to become active. Rumors such as Mobil Oil Company signing secret agreements with the Italian government, and the Italian government granting certain oil trusts exclusive sales rights for several years have caused a stir in all parties. Since the recent resignation of British Foreign Secretary Hoare has intensified the opposition between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean, the oil issue has attracted more attention from all parties.</p>
<p>Since the First World War, there has been a term [oil imperialism]. For capitalist countries, oil is not only a simple economic function, but also contains serious political and military significance. The major powers (especially Britain and the United States) have long been competing for the re-division of world oil resources and the market for sales. After the war, the oil issue has been repeatedly raised as a topic at international conferences, but no solution has been found. Just as the disarmament conference failed and led to an arms race among various countries, [oil policy] or [national oil policy] has become one of the important policies of capitalist countries. With the increasing number of automobiles and various motor vehicles in recent years, the oil issue has become more serious.</p>
<p>During the First World War from 1914 to 1918, the military significance of oil was recognized by the powers. In one of the battles from February to March 1916, tens of thousands of motor vehicles were mobilized to transport soldiers, reinforcements, food, baggage, etc. One of France's victories on July 15, 1918, was due to the superiority of tanks and motor vehicles, while the German army suffered from a lack of oil. Therefore, at a meeting when the peace treaty was concluded after the war, one representative said: [Oil from all parties has helped to defeat the German army a lot. Iron and coal are the advantages of the German army, while oil is the advantage of our army. It is good that we have an advantage in oil, which ultimately made our army win. (Note: [On the supply of oil for military affairs]).</p>
<p>Oil is the power of automobiles, tanks, airplanes, etc. During the First World War, these tools were not very developed. Now, armored vehicles, automobiles, airplanes, etc. have increased greatly compared to before, and the status of oil will inevitably be more important. Moreover, the increase in world oil production is not as fast as the increase in demand. The comparison between the two is as follows:</p>
<p>In 1934, the consumption of various motor vehicle fuels in the world totaled 67.5 million tons, including steamships and trams. According to Professor Stanton's estimate, the consumption of trams in 1934 was 60 million tons. In 1910, the fuel used by merchant ships and warships was mainly coal. According to a survey in London, 520,000 tons of oil were used in ships with a total tonnage of 42 million tons at that time. By 1934, the tonnage increased to 64 million tons, and the use of oil increased by 30 million tons.</p>
<p>The recent development of various motor vehicles is closely related to war.</p>
<p>In years of industrial decline and reduced commodities, the construction of automobile roads is very developed, which is noteworthy. According to a survey by the U.S. Department of Commerce, there were 65 million miles of automobile roads in the world in 1929. During the economic panic, there was an increase of 2.6 million miles. During this period, various countries have worked hard to build automobile roads in their colonies, such as France in Morocco, Equatorial Africa, and Indochina, Italy in Libya, the Netherlands in the Dutch East Indies, and Britain in various African colonies. The number of newly built automobile roads is quite large. Some roads are as long as 3,000 miles. Outside of Europe, countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, and Mexico are also very active in the construction of automobile roads. The main purpose of this construction is nothing more than military strategic relations, so that the transportation of troops and baggage can be facilitated.</p>
<p>What about airplanes? Its development is as follows:</p>
<p>The competition in commercial aviation routes is also intensifying. In 1934, the direct connecting route from Australia to India to Britain to South Africa, operated by the British [Imperial Airways] (transliteration), was completed. The route between France and Madagascar, operated by the French [Air France] company, and the plan for the construction of regular air routes by Italy and the Italian colonies in East Africa are all very important. Germany's aviation competition is also intensifying. In addition to paying attention to regular air routes that pass through the Atlantic Ocean and go directly to South America, it has also set a regular air transport plan to connect with the Far East. Most of the domestic routes in the United States have been completed and have turned their attention to the air routes in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The route from the Netherlands to the Dutch East Indies is very famous in aviation records.</p>
<p>Although these routes are said to be commercial and are mostly run by commercial organizations, they are given a large amount of subsidies from the national treasury by the government. Why is that? It is very clear that the so-called commercial aviation route construction has more or less the significance of war preparation.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Interest Rate Cuts Impact the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Last week, from January 6th to 11th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw an increasingly sluggish market and increasingly complex environmental changes. Since the rumor of a reduction in bond interest rates spread, public sentiment weakened. This is because the rumor raises the issue of reforming the bonds themselves. If a discount based on market price is applied, the current market price is likely to fluctuate. Recently, short sellers have mostly been occupied with arbitrage, while longer-term short positions have been taken by general speculators. The wide gap between recent market prices makes arbitrage trading impossible to predict. The interest rate cut issue has further increased difficulties in the financial sector. Those delivering spot goods also account for a portion of the market. Furthermore, the North China situation looms large. With the end of the year approaching, there may still be significant changes in the future. Last week, No. 54 and others began selling, and market prices rebounded by a few cents to over a dollar, but only slightly. On Tuesday, No. 4 bought again, and the buying on the 11th was also very strong, with prices rising a few cents to over a dollar, but the news of troop reductions caused a slight drop of half a dollar. On Wednesday, the selling pressure increased, with No. 48, No. 75, and No. 78 selling off in stages. Although No. 4 and No. 11 bought heavily, they felt significant downward pressure, with prices falling a few cents to a dollar. On Thursday, the rumor of bond interest rate cuts intensified, and No. 4 and others reduced their appetite for buying, with prices continuing to fall a few cents to one dollar and thirty-five cents. On Friday, the foreign firms slightly covered their short positions, and individual investors also made slight adjustments. No. 4 seized the opportunity to support the market, with prices rebounding by about half a dollar. Trading was quieter on Saturday, and after a brief struggle, prices continued to decline, falling by around half a dollar. Overall, the trend is difficult to view optimistically. Over the week, market prices fell by thirty-forty cents to one dollar and seventy-five cents. The total transaction volume was $14,570,500. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>American Cotton Trading Hesitant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, news from Liverpool was good, the gold yuan was weak, and Washington had new plans. Prices for all months rose by 5 to 12 points. Liverpool and mainland firms bought heavily, and Japanese firms sold new cotton, but there were fewer sellers. However, buyers were also hesitant due to a High Court ruling expected on Monday. The market then softened as the government was willing to sell at a price of 1.118 yuan for the January contract. The market became firmer again when traders bought near-term contracts at the close. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose by 4 to 19 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 9 to 10 points. Indian cotton speculators bought, but European exporters and speculative sellers dumped. Pingguol rose by 2 to 2.5 rupees. Original telegram record to the left (telegram on the 11th).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 13th is 208.5 rupees, up 1.5 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<h3>North and South Rice Prices Cut by 10-20 Cents Each</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over 50 firms arrived with goods (totaling over 10,000 dan). The selling market on this street was sluggish, and buyers consequently reduced their volume. Although there were still over 3,000 packages, the purchase terms were unusually harsh. As a result, Bo Dao fell by 10 cents, Hou Geng by 10-20 cents, and Zao Dao by 5-10 cents. Du Yang Jian with a soft texture also fell slightly, and Yin Bian Yuan also weakened.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were 46-47 sources of supply. The Bai Geng stores in the market were unusually quiet, and prices were cut by 10-20 cents. Zao Bo Dao followed with a slight reduction of more than 10 cents. Yang Bu Du Jian and other varieties were ordinary and dull, with prices falling slightly by nearly 10 cents. Ke Jian lacked trading, and Yin Bian Yuan was slightly more popular, with prices reduced by slightly more than 10 cents. Prices for other varieties also fell slightly by around 10 cents.</p>

<p>The strength of a single... cannot move a dead fly, but combined with the strength of numerous ants, to lift a wasp is as easy as lifting a feather.</p>
<p>Only "group unity" can handle major events. Under the collective planning and effort, working with united strength, there is only the happiness of the advancing group, not the private interest of the advancing individual. With this perseverance, one heart and one mind, we can overcome any difficult environment. The favorability or unfavorability of the environment ultimately depends on human effort. Therefore, we must maintain a good environment and shatter a bad environment. Because the most powerful thing in the world, besides people, is nothing else.</p>
<p>"Shao Kang of Xia revived the dynasty with a small force." This is our best model. With a calm and resolute determination, lead the collective effort; struggle! Strive! To seek our new lifeline.</p>

<h3>Lumberjack</h3>
<p>— Xian Weisheng</p>
<p>Crack, slap, thump... crack, slap, thump... This is the sound of axes felling trees on the hills of northeastern China.</p>
<p>Most work is done in the daylight, or, like factories, it is done in shifts day and night. Only logging is an exception. They don't work during the day but start working in the dark of night. It's not that they're afraid of wild animals hurting people; wild animals are only active at night. This is probably their habit!</p>
<p>They rely on the strength of their arms and their firm spirit to solve the bread problem, working hard under the dim light of oil lamps! Working! Working! In the freezing cold, although the piercing chill penetrates their bodies and the howling north wind whips like knives, they do not sigh or shrink back. They start working from the first watch of the night, "crack, slap, thump," "crack, slap, thump," until dawn before stopping. Some people who have just arrived in the north and get up early unintentionally look out the window and sometimes see white sheep on the hills, wondering if it is someone's flock that has strayed from last night. But in reality, they are not white sheep but lumberjacks covered in thick frost.</p>
<p>The above is what a friend in the Northeast told me.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes about Opium</h3>
<p>— Zhui Xin</p>
<p>Scholar Xiao Shizhai deeply hated opium in his life. When he was appointed as the Circuit Intendant of Ji'nan, he once wrote in a document to a magistrate: "The stench of opium is worse than the stench of manure!" Although the language is vulgar, it is also the truth. Opium originally has a strange smell before it is burned to maturity. The fact that addicts do not smell the stench but feel the fragrance is like living in a shop selling salted fish and forgetting the original taste.</p>
<p>Liu Zhongcheng Kunyi was heavily addicted to opium but still had moderation. When he was appointed Governor of Jiangxi, his servant would prepare more than ten opium bubbles, each weighing about one mace, early every morning. After Liu woke up, he would smoke them all in one go and then wash, eat, and handle official business without smoking again all day. One day, he discussed current affairs with a scholar who said: "The Xiang and Huai armies are deeply entrenched in their old ways. New armies should be trained to support the building." Liu was displeased and said: "Although you are talented and learned, and well-known in the country, you are just a bookworm." The scholar was furious and said: "Although I am a bookworm, I am still better than an opium ghost!" Liu was very ashamed, and the title of "Opium Ghost Governor" spread for a time.</p>
<h3>Who Will Shake Hands With?</h3>
<p>Xu Tong was a well-known stubborn official in the late Qing Dynasty, and his anti-foreign sentiments were extremely strong. He refused to use anything with the word "foreign" in it. He refused to accept Mexican coins, saying that Mexican coins were "foreign money." Someone asked: "If you hate foreigners so much, why do you still eat foreign opium?" Xu was very ashamed and destroyed his smoking set, vowing never to smoke again. The next day, his addiction flared up, and he wept and almost died. Then someone flattered him, saying: "Although foreign opium comes from abroad, China can now grow it itself. Yun soil is produced in Yunnan. Can Yunnan opium be called foreign opium?" Xu was overjoyed and resumed smoking.</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Arguing Vigorously in the Room, Preparing to Sue; Sharing Old Friendships and Forgetting Grudges.</p>
<p>The teaboy said: These two people went to visit Commissioner Lan. They talked for a long time and then inquired whether Mr. Jia was at home. Because I didn't want to disturb you, Mr. Jia, I said you were out and hadn't returned. They didn't say anything, each left a business card, and told me to give it to you, sir. Jia Duocai said: But I don't know these people. Why would they visit me? The teaboy smiled and said: Mr. Jia, can't you guess what they mean yourself? Let me bring you a basin of water to wash your face. After saying this, he smiled, turned around, carried the washbasin, and went out smiling. When Jia Duocai saw his expression, he knew there was more to it. He wondered, would they really frame me? In addition to losing both my money and my wife, I would also have to get into a lawsuit. It wouldn't be worth it. So he sat on the chair, tapped his fingers on the table, showing a hint of pleasantness in his calmness. When the teaboy came back, he was still smiling, lightly singing an opera excerpt: I ought not to fish, I should stay home idle, but my family is poor, I can do nothing. Hey! Teaboy, what is there to do in Xi'an besides listening to Shaanxi Opera? The teaboy put down the washbasin, looked at him, and replied with a smile: Will you, sir, go to the opera tonight? Jia Duocai said: Why not? I only bought this woman for 150 yuan. If I lose her, I lose her. I don't care about it. However, although I don't care about it, such fraudulent and deceptive things cannot be tolerated in society. I must punish her so that people in society don't follow suit. Teaboy, do you think I can lose such a lawsuit? But I don't know what this girl is relying on to have such great courage that she dares not to come back. The teaboy smiled without replying and walked out. Jia Duocai stood up again, clenched his right fist with his left hand, put it behind his back, and turned around a few times in the room, stamping his foot and saying to himself: It's okay to go to court. Anyway, I can't be punished again, right? The teaboy came in again, holding a business card, handed it to him with a smile: There is a reporter outside who wants to see Mr. Jia. Jia Duocai took the business card and hesitated: I'm not a VIP. Why would a reporter want to interview me? (390)</p>
<h3>The Poor Man's Radiator</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>The sky filled with dark clouds, closely followed by the howling northwest wind. After a while, goose feather-like snowflakes fluttered down, turning the earth into a silver world in an instant.</p>
<p>The bourgeois, in their tall, multi-story buildings, turned on their radiators or added more coal to their stoves, creating roaring flames. Although it was snowing outside, the inside felt like spring, and they didn't feel the cold.</p>
<p>But the proletarians, in this harsh winter weather, trembled with their bodies curled up. The cold relentlessly pressed in on them, and the skin on their hands had become chapped. Oh, God, how can the poor survive this cruel winter?</p>
<p>But "Heaven never seals off all exits." When the weather is very cold, they spend ten or twenty coppers to run into the bathhouse, where they feel a burst of warmth because there is a furnace inside. They strip off their clothes, quickly dive into the bath, and immerse their entire bodies in the hot water. How warm! It's like the best radiator, a veritable radiator for the poor.</p>
<p>After washing away the dirt from their bodies and enjoying the comfortable warmth, they are reluctant to leave this - radiator. But pressed for time, they have to step out of the bathhouse door, brave the cold wind, and rush home, where they spend the winter night on a bed thickly covered with straw, covered with a hard and torn cotton quilt.</p>
<h3>Fashion and Pain</h3>
<p>As early winter arrives, the weather gradually turns cold. Generally, the sisters standing on the "new woman" line want to dress in a modern style, completely exposing their lotus arms, and wearing only silk stockings on their jade legs, letting the north wind invade. When we see them, we really feel a little "chilled to the bone"! But their upper bodies are already adorned with modern fashions, such as cashmere sweaters and woolen coats... So they can't help but feel cold in such harsh weather. As for the intention of exposing their arms and legs, I'm not saying something insulting to women, but it's probably to "show off their flesh" in order to please the opposite sex. Otherwise, they can't escape the drive of fashion. But freezing their snow-white skin until it turns purple may lead to the pain of "cold legs" and "chilblains"!</p>
<p>Alas! It's too unjust to suffer for the sake of fashion! (Lin Chang)</p>
<p>Little Spring and Autumn Weekly</p>
<h3>New Year's Sinful Words</h3>
<p>— Qian Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The East Wall allows for intimate thoughts to be shared. Intimate without needing to open green lips. Leaping horses and swinging knives tire yesterday's dreams. Zhang Wang, Liu Di, realize previous lives. Rain carries peach and plum blossoms all become tears. Snow presses secluded boundaries, and spring is unseen. Hearing that Jinghua has a grand meeting, who is Yi Wu in my eyes?</p>
<h3>Bad New Year Customs</h3>
<p>— Zhe Cun</p>
<p>The New Year marks the beginning of the year, and it is worthy of celebration. The ancients therefore passed it down as a ceremony, and later generations added to it, gradually losing the original meaning. I still remember that during the former Qing Dynasty, the governor was the highest official in a province, and New Year's etiquette was regarded as an important matter. Those who delivered cards to the governor's office would, on that day, receive the regulations from each county magistrate. Every New Year, they would present New Year's greetings on behalf of each county. However, those who delivered cards to the governor's office in Suzhou only delivered New Year's greetings on behalf of the five counties of Fengxian, Shanghai, Jintan, Yuanhe, and Baoshan. Other counties were not allowed to join. What was the reason? It was to take the first character of the five counties, meaning to offer gold yuan for sale. The bad custom continued, which is very laughable.</p>
<h3>Private Mailbag</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>People's letters to their loved ones are sometimes secretly opened, resulting in the disclosure of secrets, which is very regrettable. Now it's better. The post office has recently added a "private mailbag" service. We only need to prepare a locked mailbag and send it to the post office, keeping one key for ourselves and depositing the other at the post office. After receiving our mailbag, the post office will put the letters sent to us from various places into the bag, and we can pick them up on time. At the same time, when we want to mail items to various places, we only need to seal them in the bag, and the post office will send them according to the address. In this way, all our letters can be received and sent by ourselves without the need for others, and any secrets will not be leaked. Convenient and secure, nothing could be better. The cost is 12 yuan for the whole year and 6 yuan for half a year.</p>
<h3>Contributing a Small Opinion</h3>
<p>— Zhen Ru</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the new monetary policy, the terms "silver dollar" and "foreign dollar" can no longer be used legally. The term "foreign" in Chinese bookkeeping should be reformed and replaced with "national currency," which is undoubtedly correct. However, the grids in Chinese bookkeeping books are very short, and the two characters "national currency" always feel cramped. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to Xu Chongdao National Medicine Store, advocating replacing "foreign" with "currency," using only the character "currency," which is excellent. However, the character "currency" has too many strokes, and it is still feared that people will not get used to it. My opinion is to abbreviate it as "巾," pronounced as "bi," which would be easier to write, and the reform would be easier. If everyone can get used to it, it will not be unfamiliar over time. If this is appropriate, I hope experts will correct it.</p>
<h3>Writing Brush</h3>
<p>— Wu Yazaizhu</p>
<p>The writing brush, known as the "three-inch cone," has been around for more than 2,200 years since it was invented by General Meng Tian of the Qin Dynasty.</p>
<p>Although the writing brush is a small stationery item, it has made a huge contribution to culture. Haven't the poets and literati of all dynasties been immortalized because of it? If it didn't exist, what would they have relied on to leave their names to posterity?</p>
<h3>Light, Heavy, Long, and Short Characters</h3>
<p>— Xiao Jun</p>
<p>The lightest character is "丙" - only half a tael. The heaviest character is "斯" - a total of 32 catties. The longest character is "重" - 1,000 li. The shortest character is "寺" - only 1 chi and 1 cun.</p>
<p>Logically, since the writing brush has had more than 2,000 years of culture and history, it should be further developed and promoted. However, the opposite is true. Now its position in the hands of literati is gradually shaking. The pen, which is replacing its position, is slowly taking over, which is regrettable. If we examine the reasons for this, half is that the intellectual class is too Westernized, and half is that the manufacturers are too conservative and do not improve it.</p>
<p>Every day, seeing large advertisements for "XX Pens on Sale" in the newspaper, I can't help but sigh for the "writing brush that has made a huge contribution to culture" and the tens of thousands of craftsmen who rely on it for a living.</p>
<p>Correction: On the "Huangshan Miscellany" page of the 8th issue, the phrase "one wave cold on the sea" in the eighth line, the character "cold" is a mistake for the character "cloud". We hereby correct it.</p>

<h3>"The Last Lesson" and Taking a Break</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>"The Last Lesson" is indeed extremely painful!</p>
<p>When the situation in North China entered a serious state, the students in Beijing and Tianjin felt that they were attending "The Last Lesson," and then launched a student movement. Before long, students in various places also saw that "The Last Lesson" was approaching, so they quickly responded. The national spirit, which had been dead for many years, was suddenly awakened by the warning of "The Last Lesson"!</p>
<p>Chinese students in recent times have been very aware. They know that after "The Last Lesson" is over, they will no longer be citizens of their motherland and will not have the opportunity to receive education from their motherland. On the eve of September 18th, the students in the Northeast had "The Last Lesson." They have now put down their books and are receiving a kind of slave education. Seeing the tragic fate of their compatriots in the Northeast who lost their province, the students in Peiping are willing to make a final struggle with their own blood before "The Last Lesson" is dismissed, rather than endure humiliation and let the enemy control the school!</p>
<p>The student movement was forced out by "The Last Lesson," which everyone should clearly recognize. Unfortunately, although there are many people in society who sympathize with the student movement, there are also quite a few who oppose it. Some educators have failed in their duty because they cannot stand on the same side as the students and guide them to work for national salvation. How painful it is that they are trying their best to suppress the students' patriotic actions!</p>
<p>Now, all universities in Peiping have implemented early vacations. This is the most ingenious way to prevent student movements. Forced by "The Last Lesson" and unable to withstand the threat of enemy aircraft, the students in Peiping launched a student movement, hoping to save the critical situation in North China with their own blood. But the educational authorities in Peiping seem to feel that the students' actions are too nervous, so they stop them in advance and then take a break. In this way, even "The Last Lesson" cannot be taught!</p>
<p>When all the universities in Peiping were taking breaks, only Peking University continued to hold classes. Unfortunately, several patriotic students have been warned. Chiang Meng-lin, the president of Peking University, recently made a statement saying, "The school's encouragement to students to resume classes is for the sake of the country, the nation, and the future of all students... Student movements must end at a certain point, otherwise the results will not be satisfactory... I love the country, I love the nation, and especially I love the passionate students, but I can't bear to see even greater and more humiliating events unfolding in the future, affecting the entire education of Peiping..." Is it difficult to believe that after the end of the student movement, even greater and more humiliating events will not unfold in the future? It should be known that the purpose of the patriotic movements of students across the country recently is nothing more than to prevent the occurrence of even greater and more humiliating events in the future!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Peiping has now implemented vacations one after another, and the general students do not stop their work of saving the country because the school is on vacation. During the vacation, the Normal University studied the educational problems of the extraordinary period in order to reform the education of North China. The Student Union and various schools mainly focus on the work of contact and propaganda. The situation can be summarized as follows: 1. The Tsinghua University bicycle team arrived in Dezhou on New Year's Day. Due to the illness of a female team member, they will continue to move forward after recuperating. 2. Fifty students from Yenching University gathered in Qinghe on the 8th and gave lectures in the surrounding villages. 3. More than 20 members of the Peking University Medical School rescue team went to Gu'an on the 7th to expand the propaganda team. 4. The first and second groups of the Student Union propaganda team arrived in Liulihe on the 7th, and the third group arrived in Gu'an. 5. The Northeast University propaganda team performed a patriotic play at Wanshou Temple on the 6th. (It is said that there were more than a thousand farmers in the audience that day, and the police came to interfere. The pickets confronted them, and the stalemate lasted for a long time.)</p>
<p>In his "Letter to Fudan Students," Mr. Ma Xiangbo said, "For the sake of you, it is better to enlighten the people than to appeal to the government. The streets and alleys, teahouses and taverns are all places where you can serve the country." Now that we have no way to appeal to the government, then enlightening the people should be the most beneficial work for the country. I dare to advise the patriotic students of the whole country with this.</p>
<h3>Yuanbao Fish</h3>
<p>— Xu Jie</p>
<p>"Mom, are we having fish today?" When Xiao Bao saw a fish in the vegetable basket jump to the ground, he shouted even more happily than when he first wore his tattered cotton-padded jacket.</p>
<p>Xiao Bao's mother went to the market early this morning. Because it was the New Year, she planned to make four meat dishes. It was snowing. She walked from one end of the market to the other, and then back again, clutching six dimes, and finally only bought a fish, a piece of meat, a few eggs, and some vegetables. She couldn't make the four meat dishes she had planned, and the six dimes were all spent. When she got home, she grumbled to herself that the vegetable sellers had no conscience and were desperately raising prices for the New Year. In the past, six dimes could make five dishes and a soup. Unable to suppress this nameless fire, she threw the vegetable basket angrily on the ground and fell onto the low stool for cooking. In fact, her small, hoof-shaped feet were too tired to move after walking so much on the slippery road. But the Yuanbao fish jumped out of the basket. Perhaps it was its last struggle before being killed, or perhaps it was unaccustomed to being a prisoner in the damp house, curling its tail and jumping a few times.</p>
<p>Xiao Bao was seven years old, but he had never tasted meat or fish since he was born. Every meal was a plate of pickled vegetables, and his mother would still shout beside him to eat quickly and not pick at the food. Now there was meat and eggs in the basket, and a fresh, live fish. When Xiao Bao wanted to grab it, his mother stopped him:</p>
<p>"Don't touch it, it belongs to the Bodhisattva!"</p>
<p>Xiao Bao didn't know what a Bodhisattva was, but he understood when his mother glared at him. So, a Bodhisattva must be something even more powerful than his father. Because when his father and mother fought, his mother would always smash his father's things. Now, Xiao Bao wasn't allowed to even touch this fish that belonged to the Bodhisattva. Xiao Bao was stunned. He imagined the Bodhisattva as a tiger, a wild cat, everything most terrifying. At the same time, he greedily stared at the meat, eggs, and the Bodhisattva's fish on the ground in the basket.</p>
<p>Xiao Bao's mother was in a bad mood because six dimes wasn't enough to make four meat dishes, so she wasn't very kind. But when she saw Xiao Bao standing there looking pitiful, she thought about how hard the child had already had it. Since the factory cut wages, his father had never bought anything good to eat. How could the child not be happy when he saw so much good food? She hugged Xiao Bao and kissed his frostbitten cheeks, saying softly, "These dishes are for the Bodhisattva. If Dad earns Yuanbao next year, Bao Bao will have new clothes to wear and good things to eat."</p>
<p>Although Xiao Bao still didn't know what the Bodhisattva looked like, he often heard his father say that he hoped the factory's business would be good and the wages would be restored to what they used to be, so they could have a happy New Year. Then Xiao Bao squinted his little eyes and thought, "Maybe the Bodhisattva is the foreigner at the factory." Thinking this, Xiao Bao became happy again, jumped out of his mother's arms, and said:</p>
<p>"Mom, will the Bodhisattva come back with Dad?"</p>
<p>"Yes, good Bao Bao." Mom patted his head and stood up to prepare the dishes.</p>
<p>That evening, the fish's eyes were covered with red paper, and it was hung from the window with a red velvet rope. Four dishes were placed on the table, candles were lit, and Mom kowtowed, dragging Xiao Bao to bow four times as well. Xiao Bao jumped in and out, waiting for his father to come home. He wanted to see the Bodhisattva. The fish swung its tail in the air, often hitting the window lattice.</p>
<p>Dad came back, alone, without the Bodhisattva. Xiao Bao threw himself into his mother's arms and said, "The Bodhisattva didn't come. Kill that fish so Bao Bao can eat it!"</p>
<p>His mother kissed his face again and coaxed him, "The Bodhisattva doesn't eat fish either. That's called Yuanbao fish. We'll release it tomorrow, and then Dad will earn Yuanbao."</p>
<p>Xiao Bao really couldn't figure out what the Bodhisattva looked like. If it didn't eat fish, why did Mom buy it to invite it? He thought of tigers, wild cats, foreigners, and stared at the Yuanbao fish with its eyes covered, constantly hitting the window lattice.</p>

<h3>Spending the New Year in the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>The north wind howled across the entire field, and the trees by the village had already lost all their leaves. The weeds flew in the wind, and snowflakes covered the ground and piled up on the cliffs, creating a cold world where half of everything was white. We rushed to deliver the last batch of goods to Mao Dun, it was already the end of the year. Everyone rested and prepared to have a good New Year. But after eating the Kitchen God send-off meal, Old Yan came to find us to travel again. Everyone was unhappy when they heard that we had to travel. Old Zhu grumbled first: "We can't even get a day off all year round!..."</p>
<p>We packed our belongings, put our rifles on our shoulders, and Old Zhu was still slowly tying up his burden, dragging his old and weak legs, and slowly followed us into the mountains. There weren't many burdens this time, only three, including Old Zhu's. We escorted them with four rifles. We left Dun Tou Ao, and everyone walked energetically. We were planning to take the old road, but suddenly Old Yan stopped us at the fork in the road from behind.</p>
<p>We stopped, and Xiao Gouzi caught up from behind and said, "Brother Yan told you to take the horizontal road, be careful. There's a slope below!"</p>
<p>This made us understand immediately, and we comforted ourselves in our hearts, thinking, "What tricks is Boss Xu playing this time, moving these three burdens to the edge of the mountain? The road isn't even accessible, and there are only seven or eight villages at most. What kind of business is there?..." However, the thought that we didn't have to travel far today made us feel relieved, even though the wind and snow were still blowing fiercely, piercing like sharp knives. But it would be much easier to endure just these three or four hours of travel...</p>
<p>As we expected, we arrived at Lingbian Village at noon. Old Yan had taken the lead this time, leaving Xiao Gouzi behind. He approached us and said softly, "Zhuang Er, you guys take these few burdens and three rifles in through the back door. I told Mo Da to meet you at the back... I'll go scout things out here first." Actually, we knew that he wasn't scouting anything, he just liked to put on airs, so he walked towards the main gate, to chat with Hu Datou.</p>
<p>Old Yan stuffed his revolver into his cotton coat, sticking out his fat belly, and swaggered towards the main stone road in the village. We changed direction and walked into an alley. As soon as we separated, Old Zhu began to mutter to himself as if he had been wronged, "Making us travel on a bird path at the end of the year? There are red flowers every year, but there weren't any last year. They said business was bad, but they just made us suffer our whole lives! We still have to travel today, who believes there's no business!... I don't know what's going to happen this year, will we make a profit or not?..." Everyone rolled their eyes at him and didn't say anything. Xiao Gouzi was wiping his runny nose, as if nothing had anything to do with him. He often shrank his head into his large collar, looking like a rabbit.</p>
<p>Mo Da led us in through the back door and directly up to the three-story watchtower. There were no windows above, and the small peepholes revealed some dim light. There were spider webs and dust all around, making it look quite gloomy. Some messy furniture was piled on the floor, and there was a plank bed against the wall. We put our rifles on the wall, unbuckled our belts, and sat on the bed for a while. Old Yan came up from downstairs, inspected our belts, his stingy eyes frequently glanced at the bullets, and counted the rows on each belt with his fingers, then threw them all together in the corner of the bed, and instructed Mo Da, "Go ask Hu Daye to come here and see what to do?..." He turned around and asked Xiao Gouzi, "Is there any raw oil left in the small bottle?..."</p>
<p>Hu Datou came up, and we opened all the burdens of goods. Mo Da carried up a few large wooden boxes from downstairs, put old newspapers on the bottom of the boxes, and we stacked the goods into the boxes one package at a time. After stacking half of them, Hu Datou picked out a package and opened it. It was a few black, cake-like things. We thought to ourselves, "Damn, it's actually local specialties!" But we pretended not to see it and kept stacking one package at a time.</p>
<p>After stacking the goods, Old Yan instructed Xiao Gouzi to take out a bottle of raw oil and give it to us to wipe the gun barrels. He went to mingle with Hu Datou again.</p>
<p>After a while, Mo Da came and told us to go to the main hall for lunch. But Old Yan was nowhere to be seen. Mo Da said that he had eaten first and went out with Hu Datou, and two horses had died. He also told Mo Da to remind us not to go outside casually, to wipe our guns and sleep in the watchtower.</p>
<p>In the evening, Old Yan returned from outside. He said to us breathlessly, "Boss Xu just said that he wants us to spend the New Year at Hu Daye's place. Although business is bad this year, we guys will get some bonuses... Everyone relax... and do more for the boss..." We understood what he meant. But we didn't say anything, and quietly let the darkness gradually envelop the entire watchtower, even the ray of light at the bottom of the peephole was swallowed. ... And so, we spent this year in the countryside peacefully, and passed this remaining end of the year.</p>
<h3>Home</h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>Alone, lonely, lying on the sickbed, the window is bathed in bright sunlight; a white kitten on the roof, is lazily sleeping in the sun, its tail hanging down comfortably; in the distant sky, a few light clouds are slowly moving, revealing a scene of tranquility. In the deep alley, the cries of vendors, gray with blood and tears, lightly, lightly, knock on my lonely heart.</p>
<p>"One only has oneself when one is lonely"; in my illness, I feel the quiet of loneliness, witnessing this interesting and picturesque scene of loneliness, and I myself become quiet. Being sick in a foreign land makes me long for and think of my distant hometown; normally I cherish some of the scenery and wild vegetables of my hometown, but in illness, when no one cares for my well-being, no one cares about my condition, at this time the ancient home is prominent.</p>
<p>In my illness, the ancient home is prominent in my thoughts; in the home without sunlight, everything is old, worn, and lonely; I was there, once living days gray with blood and tears, within it, I shed precious tears of childhood, and lonely embarked on my journey. Yet every year wandering in foreign lands is also living days gray with blood and tears. In my memory, I have not forgotten that in the home without sunlight, there is my forever lonely mother; I am blessing her.</p>
<p>The scenery of my hometown sometimes makes me yearn, but when I think of those gray days, I forget about it; being sick in a foreign land, feeling the quiet of loneliness, in my memory I think of my lonely mother, and the warmth of the home without sunlight. (Occasional notes from a sickbed)</p>

Thinking of you in all four seasons, everything is empty. At the fifth watch, the rooster crows but I am not yet asleep. The sixth son's powdered face is covered with tears. The seventh night of the seventh month is hard to anticipate, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's meeting. Eight lines of letter, not able to write completely, the feelings of two hearts. Nine turns of the intestines, the intestines are about to break. Ten, a plain Ding Lang, intentions are hazy. Twelve floors high, gazing in vain. Nine provinces, an iron plan, endless regrets. Eight-character eyebrows are therefore always locked tight. A seven-stringed qin speaks of grievances heavy and long. A six-foot tall man is actually tormented by the demon of love. Five tombs, furs and horses are gone with the east wind. The four great elements are all empty, talking is not easy. Three lifetimes without fate, blaming the vast sky.

Miss, with the bright moon, there is no need for flower lanterns to be inferior to the bright moon. Red Maiden, looking at flowers under the moon, the flowers are rich and noble. Appreciating the moon before the flowers, the moon is full of spirit. The flower spirit invites the moon spirit. The moon spirit, the moon pierces the flower path.

Hoping that the spirits will show my white-haired parent in a dream. The Miss, secretly tells the things in her heart in a sealed gourd. Who knows that two or three points have already been leaked. The spring colors have always been most annoying.</p>

<p>Opening "Daughter in the Hands of a Stepmother"</p>
<p>Yangliu Tower and Terrace, dreams unfulfilled. The courtyard of Wu Tong, the moon rises. That lonely orphan girl leans on the railing to gaze. Seeing a desolate moonlight. Drawing down a thousand drops of tears in her heart. How can she bear to look back and recall the past. Half a year ago, her loving mother was still alive. The whole family gathered joyfully in a heavenly paradise. The mother pities the darling daughter, and the daughter pities the mother. Like that, the star relies on the bright moon, and the moon relies on the star. Following each other, they never leave. Who doesn't envy the happy family. Spending their days in harmony and good times. Who knew, that love would be envied by the heavens. A sudden clap of thunder takes her mother away. White and vast, mother and daughter separated by the underworld. Dark and endless, different paths to the nether world. My dear mother, you died only half a year ago. My father's paternal heart has changed. Seeing his sister-in-law, he completely forgets his mother in the springs. Going with the flow, spending morning and evening. Not thinking that she is his sister of the same womb. Leaving me, the ferry without a boat, drifting sideways. All the various tortures, and a thousand hardships. A word of pain, half a word of scolding. Blindly deceiving my weak orphan girl. Who can I tell my full of grievances to. Originally, when people are there, feelings are there. When people die, feelings end. I was ill and almost couldn't get up. Who, would cook tea and medicine with diligence. Tonight, I am forcing my sick bones in the west wind. Quietly crying to Chang'e a few times. My cries of sorrow cannot reach your ears, dear mother. The living separation, breaks my nine-year-old heart. Ask who, is the most lonely and miserable. The first name among the miserable lives. Must count me, this daughter in the hands of a stepmother.</p>

<p>Aftertaste</p>
<p>Hu Xianxia, ​​Social Director of the Zacao Art Friends Association and Mengna Art Society, and film and dance editor of the Shanghai Evening News, yesterday again accompanied Ying She’s Li Tianfeng to eight dance halls including Dahu, Datong, and Yuegong Yun.</p>
<p>Shanghai Evening News Microphone will be republished recently.</p>
<p>Please pay attention to "He" Jun, I don’t know if the asked "Lu Ye She" is "Lu Ye Yi She". If so, the club address is in Rose New Village near Xujiahui.</p>
<p>The Municipal West Choral Group will appear recently.</p>
<p>Shen Zhifan, the president of Pingying Society who once co-edited the microphone with Xie Nong, has now officially hung up his sign as a doctor. If people from the broadcasting industry go to see him, they can get a 17% discount. (Yi Tan)</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Yu Hua, a pillar of the former Xinhua News Agency, also known as Yu Lihua, has been silent in the broadcasting and singing circles for a long time after marrying Jin Peiyu. Recently, Yu has stated to people that it is not as reported in the newspapers. According to reports, she has lived in seclusion since the dissolution of Xinhua News Agency. This is really a strange thing, and Jin Peiyu might as well come out and make a "solemn statement." (Tie Bao)</p>
<p>It is said that Haifeng Amimi is contacting several former classmates and wants to organize a singing group, entitled the Paris Group. Is this accurate? To be verified. (Le Jun)</p>
<p>Haifeng has been holding Amimi for two or three months, claiming to have performed a "Ruse of Empty Cities", but in reality he was just having a "Peach Blossom Dream." (Ma Rulong)</p>
<p>The English Infant of Lu Ye She is very similar to the hot girl Tan Ying. (Qiu Ying)</p>
<p>A draft about Feng Han and Li Ying's engagement in the previous issue was "fabricated."</p>
<p>It is said that Zhao Chaojun, the publisher of "Geta", received two lawyer's letters due to the inclusion of articles involving two singers in a certain issue.</p>
<p>Miss Li Ying also has the intention to co-operate with ×× she. (Above, Three Lives)</p>
<p>Dazhibao reporter Qiuying Jun, chief editor of the Feihong Bianyue Kan, a literary supplement "Freedom".</p>
<p>Qin Quan is the most enthusiastic about Li Ying.</p>
<p>Mao Ruijia of Yayin Society has recently taken up a position in the advertising department of Feihong Bianyue Kan.</p>
<p>Qian Jishun has been quite negative recently, and has stopped writing articles about broadcasting news, etc.</p>
<p>Shi Hua of Pingshe Bianyue Kan said to people: "Feihong is doing well, and the second issue of Pingshe will have an amazing discovery!" The great writers Lu Xun, Donghua, etc. are writing articles for Pingshe Bianyue Kan. (Above, Yu Zi)</p>
<p>It is said that Feiyin Society has invited Miss Xu Qi.</p>
<p>Xu Qi recently falsely claimed to be "Silver Rain" and said that I was some kind of pseudonym of Zhao Chao (a smile)</p>
<p>Yesterday Xu Qi ate Tao Dan's wedding wine but did not give a gift.</p>
<p>Xu Qi has not dared to run to the radio station recently, especially several singing groups.</p>
<p>Wherever Bai Yan is, Jiang Zaiqiu (Bai Dun) must be standing next to her.</p>
<p>Joining the Xinyi Society, which is sponsored by Yu Jia, will surely have hope when the top ten singers are elected in the future.</p>
<p>It is said that Lao Jia Jun is Wu Xiongjian himself!</p>
<p>The Datong Society almost had a piano solo performance yesterday, fortunately Zhou Mingyuan was at the City Music.</p>
<p>Bao Xuexue has had a toothache these past few days. (Editor's note: According to Sheng Zhou, Wen Lu will be staying in Nanjing permanently.)</p>
<p>The great reporter Haifeng has often appeared in the Chao Yun Society these past few days.</p>
<p>Wu Zhanda looked for Zhao Chao at a radio station yesterday but did not find him. (Above, Chi Seng)</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<h3>Reed Snow in National Beauty</h3>
<p>Shanghai Sound Film Company, but Director Duyu's National Beauty, took a scene of reed marshes, specifically purchased a large number of reeds from Wusong, and then planted them unevenly on the set, illuminated by moonlight, the quietness and brightness are indescribable. The ancients' Notes on Looking at Reed Flowers in Qiuxue'an mentions that when climbing the pavilion on a moonlit night, the white clouds are ethereal, the clear breeze is gentle, and the crystal light flickers, after a long while, one feels that one's body is fluttering and rising like a fairy, as if in the realm of a fairy bird in a water pot, and no longer sees the world of heaven, earth, and man. This realm is similar to that, and the characters in the play are Dan Erchun and Bai Yan.</p>
<h3>Datong's Performance of a Stage Play, the Stage People's Headquarters is Mobilized</h3>
<p>The emerging Datong Company is a gathering of first-class actors in the drama world. Men and women have all had sufficient training and experience in acting. Usually, because they are busy with work, they have not been able to fully mobilize and hold large-scale performances. However, this group of backbones of the drama movement has never slackened in their interest in exploring stage art. Recently, after proposals by Sun Shiyi, Situ Huimin, and Li Dashen, they concentrated their efforts in the shortest period of time to hold their first performance to launch the drama movement in 1936. As for the script, Chai Hofu's three famous works have been decided: "Dumbass", "The Proposal", and "Anniversary". The above three plays are being actively rehearsed. It is expected that at the beginning of 1936, which will be a sharp advancement in the drama movement, there will definitely be a burst of brilliance in the drama's acting skills.</p>
<h3>Star Actively Building a Studio</h3>
<p>The sound studio of the main factory of Star Company has been actively constructed since the foundation was laid earlier. The wasteland that used to be covered with rubble has now been transformed into a neat and flat factory. It is expected that soon, this magnificent sound studio will be completed in front of thousands of film art lovers.</p>
<p>Although the Star Sound Studio is not dare to say how unprecedentedly great the building is, in the current impoverished Chinese film front, at least it can be said that this is a studio in China that is most suitable for shooting sound films. In addition to anticipating the convenience of photography, it also takes into account the convenience of recording, etc.</p>
<p>Proceeding simultaneously in all aspects, the establishment of the Star Sound Studio next year will definitely achieve the two goals of increasing production and improving standards.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the "Wedding Night" Four Great Talents</h3>
<p>Director Yue Feng - A director with a great future. "Raging Tide of the China Sea" and "Escape" have successively established many remarkable achievements in the stagnant Chinese film industry. "Wedding Night" is a sound film produced with all his efforts after changing his style. Its excellence is self-evident.</p>
<p>Cinematographer Wang Chanquan - A young and enterprising young man. "Wedding Night" is his debut. The beauty of the picture, the softness of the light, the appropriateness of the angle, and the flexibility of the camera fully demonstrate his rich experience and hard work. May you strive, great young cinematographer!</p>
<p>Set Designer Bao Tianming - Has rich artistic cultivation and is a talented artist with quick thinking and loyalty to his work. He has indelible achievements in "Wedding Night." The sets of several Li Mansion living rooms, bridal chambers, and countrysides are enough to prove his intelligence.</p>
<p>Sound Recorder Gu Zongyi - A rare technical talent in the Chinese film circle. He tried "The Storm" with a self-made recorder and achieved remarkable results. Thus, "Hero of the Hour," "Song of Triumph," each movie progressed, and each play was excellent. Now, "Wedding Night" has reached a state of perfection. The clarity of the sound and the volume are comparable to imported products, and even surpasses them.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou "Sanwu Drama Society" Debut Performance</h3>
<p>Some friends say that it is really not easy for spoken drama to raise its head in this era when sound film has progressed perfectly! In fact, the friend who said this must not have seen the great activity of spoken drama in the already passed twenty-fourth year.</p>
<p>Needless to say, spoken drama and film are both capable of winning the needs of the audience; precisely because they have completely different points, speaking from the standpoint of art.</p>
<p>On the poetic West Lake, on the contrary, the theatrical movement is quiet and lifeless; this is not because the people of Hangzhou have a weak interest in spoken drama, but because there are too few talents willing to work hard in the spoken drama movement! However, there is new activity in front of us. The "Zhejiang Drama Society," "China Drama Society," and the new "Sanwu Drama Society" have been established one after another. This society is an amateur drama society organized by famous drama people from Hangzhou, such as Huang Tianhe, the former president of the West Lake Drama Society, Liu Yubai, the former host of the Nanjing Lion Roar Drama Society, and Yang Lin, the former director of the Yihai Film Company's drama department. Now they have selected Tian Han's plays "Tragedy on the Lake," "Death of a Famous Actor," and "Flood"... to make their debut performance on February 8th, to meet with the audience in Hangzhou. It is expected that a new activity will shine all over West Lake at that time.</p>
