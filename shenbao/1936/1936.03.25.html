<p>— 樸</p>
<p>去年十月間上海標金·公債·紗花·麵粉·雜糧各交易所均曾因幣制改革之謠一度蓬勃活躍嗣以貨幣政策施行外匯穩定標金首受影響價格常盤旋於一千一百五十元左右不復有顯著之榮辱素稱繁榮之金業市塲頓呈門庭冷落之象其他市塲亦漸趨於安定迨國債統一換償案實行卽雄居首位之證券市塲亦呈空前之沒落每日成交數額自三數千萬元銳减至一二百萬元爲該所有史以來之最低紀錄回首前塵不勝滄桑之感此其原因不僅在國債統一換償而已良以遠東局勢日趨緊張歐洲時局受德軍開入萊因區之激刺又宛如大戰開始卽在瞬息投機者流乃熱中於紗花麵粉雜糧等物品市塲因而公債市塲益疲不能興矣</p>
<p>最近之物品投機已代往日標金公債之地位而成爲投機者之生命線各物品交易所之興旺氣象適與金業證券兩市塲之蕭條景象相映對照然物品投機其風險實遠甚於證券蓋以公債而論若政治上無重大之變故既有利息之收益復有中籤還本之機會反之物品買賣多頭收貨問題卽較龐雜囤積現貨不僅無固定之利息可獲且須貼補拆息棧租保險各費以及存貨虧耗之損失各項併計以棉花而論每月每包之損失最低的計國幣五角若以囤積半年而論每擔損失卽達國幣三元以視有價證券其一出一入相去匪尠再則主要物產如棉麥之類皆爲國際的商品其價格亦視國際之供求關係而爲轉移若國內價格稍低外商卽乘機收買飛漲過甚外貨又相繼傾銷是故物品市塲常得國際間之調節而保持其平衡不致若有價證券之兔起鶻落漫無限度卽如棉紗麵粉之類製成品亦皆隨其關係原料以爲漲落準則若猛抬在拉使成品與原料之比價相距過甚廠商以厚利可圖不免大量套售不問需要之若何而竭全力以趕製結果又陷於生產過剩之危險矣</p>
<p>綜觀物品之投機初不若公債之單純易曉而投機者流又多盲目附和惟冀有利可圖其能於某項商品有相當之認識並略知其國際產銷情形者則不可多得卽經紀人方面亦祇憑多年之經騐以爲經營之張本其有技術素養而曾受科學洗禮者實鳳毛麟角故物品投機前途亦頗難樂觀日前紗花粉麥狂漲最近又轉跌風已使盲目多頭獲一敎訓矣</p>

<p>「旣然不欠，並且還敲你竹槓，爲甚麽文要揩你女人呢」？</p>
<p>「還是大家害了他」！二三十張嘴幾乎同時說話。</p>
<p>「怎末說」？</p>
<p>「我們因爲年年受圖正的敲榨，實在無法供應了，所以今年有人發起大家自己到糧櫃上去完納。那知風聲傳了出去，他—指圖正—便先落手爲强了！」</p>
<p>一個靑年農民滔滔的向我解釋。大家的臉部表情很是緊張。</p>
<p>「還有，今年圖正扣住由單不發，我自己到縣裏去完。糧櫃上說沒有由單不能完。後來我橫了心腸和他們吵起來，我說：你們不給我完，我要到省政府去告狀！他們沒法，呌一位老先生來勸我，並且替我査出錢糧數目，結果完了十一塊二角。因此圖正更加恨我了！」這是俊泉的話。</p>
<p>「有沒有開庭？」</p>
<p>「沒有！請求開庭的稟單已經去過五决了！」</p>
<p>「五張稟單都進到城隍廟裏去了！」</p>
<p>大家不自然的一笑，立刻又被嚴肅的空氣包圍着。</p>
<p>我驚異了！縣政府無綠無故把一個農婦押了六十多天，不訊不釋，這是什麼道理呢？</p>
<p>過了陽曆新年，我在路上碰到前述村巷上的一個農民，據他告訴我，俊泉的妻子押到第六十六天才傳他去訊問，問的話全無關係。這時他的妻子病了，俊泉自己去替代，現在又已經二十多天了！不知這官司要吃到何時才能出獄？</p>
<p>今夜正是廢曆的臘月二十六了，（夫妻二人一共已經押了九十四天）尖銳的西風，斷續地帶來了寒犬的吠聲，時鐘在凝凍的空氣裏滴答地嚮着，這使我想到現在獄中受罪的俊泉，他恐怕今年是不能回家吃「年夜飯」了罷？</p>
<p>五結　結語</p>
<p>前述的多種事實，已够說明催徵吏擾民手段的毒辣，和被剝削者任人宰割的慘狀了。以前我也曾屢屢的看到關於四川等省横徵暴斂的報告，那時還以爲這不過是軍閥割據局面下特有的現象。現在才知道「天下的烏鴉原是一般黑」的</p>

<p>羅馬　意·奧·匈今日簽訂三國協定、以延長一九三四年三國協定有效期限、而鞏固三國政治與經濟關係、與互助公的相彷彿、惟詞義比較含混、（廿三日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬　今日意奧匈三國所簽定之協的、現信其條欵之一、為國聯如下諭實施對德制裁、三國决不參加、聞的中並聲明維持奧國獨立之决心、而邀其他數國加入該的、顯擬使奧國與捷克得更密切合作、三國又允在經濟方面彼此增進商業關係、該的將於今日公布、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　官方宣布、首相墨索里尼本日午後在威尼斯宮會同奧國總理休樞尼格、匈國總理貢博斯簽署議定書一伴、作為一九三四年三月十七日意奧匈三國協定之附件、其全文定於明日午後公布、關於三國談話經過悄形、頃經發表最後公報、謂「三國當局秉懇摯之精神、彼此均能互相晾解」云云、據一般人所知、意奧匈三國當局、業巳同意對於外交政策採取共同立場、並已商定多瑙河各國、得在某種條件之下、加入一九三四年三國協定、惟在制裁辦法繼續實施期間、意國不願與參加制裁之國家、成立協定、至今後任何協定、則當承認平等權利之原則、並在國聯會範圍內訂立之云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意奧匈三國當局日昨簽署議定書之後、意相墨索里尼復於本日正午十二時、與奧國內閣總理休樞尼格、外長魏德格會談一小時、預料本日午後、仍當發表公報、有所說明、據政界方面宣稱、三國當局、此决雖已商定多瑙河流域各國、在某種條件之下、得加入一九三四年三國恊定、但昨日所簽署之議定書、僅由意奧匈三國列名、據消息靈通人士表示、此决三國當局進行談話時、對於奧匈兩國重整軍備一項問題、亦曾偶爾談及云、奧匈兩國代表團多數人員、已定於本日晚間啟程返國、但兩國總揆休樞尼格暨貢博斯、則尚擬以私人資格、在此勾留數日、教皇庇護斯十一世、定於本日晚間、接見貢博斯、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　意奧匈三國當局、日昨簽署議定書之後、又於本日簽訂另一議定書、規定由關係各國外交部長、組織常設會議、按期開會、按此項會議、實與小協商各國常設政治會議相類似、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>析林　國聯會行政院會議、德國出席代表里本特洛浦、業於本日午後二時零八分、携帶政府對於羅卡諾四國恊定之復文、飛往倫敦、此項復文內容如何、外間毫無所知、政界人士均不願加以評論、惟半官方面宣稱、里本特洛浦此行、除携有書面復文之外、並擬在行政院開會時口頭補充說明、至外交界人士以為德國對於羅卡諾四國恊定數種辦法、當加以拒絕、更於其他數種辦法、探取延宕手段、總之、德國政府復文、須俟里本特洛浦送達英國外相艾登寓目之後、始可發表云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　法國今日正式照會英國、聲明對四國協定不欲有所讓步，且不願在倫敦討論德國任何對案、此足證明英法立場已發生異點、而使因德國行動引起之時局一時解决無望、聞德總代表里賓特羅浦將軍回抵倫敦後、將留駐數日、如談判後有妥恊之望、則羅卡諾公的國大的將在洛桑續開會議、國聯各方面因羅卡諾公的國遲遲不能與德國商獲妥協、漸呈不耐之象、今日午後行政院會議或將决議宣布行政院之延會、而照常例於五月間再行集議、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　國聯會行政院原定於本日午後四時、討論羅卡諾四國協定、茲因德國出席代表里本特洛浦、於本日午後二時、始自柏林前來、屆時未必及時赶到、故行政院已决定展期開會、但一般人以為行政院延會之眞正原因、乃因關係各國意見紛歧、致使荊棘叢生云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　關於羅卡諾四國協定一案、外傳政府對於德國所可提出之對案、業已决定拒不加以討論、頃由負責人士加以證實、并謂薩勞總理及佛蘭亭外長、均曾一再聲明、法國不欲在威脅之下進行談剁、國際法治制度、必須予以恢復、即關於德國備忘錄所提各項建議、提付討論一層、法國并非確定加以拒絕、但要求在國際會議中行之、此乃外長佛蘭亭與不管部閣員彭古、日前在倫敦出席羅卡諾會議時、與英·比·意三國代表所商定者、雖然、羅卡諾四國協定所規定之條件、業由英國內閣加以贊可者、仍須付諸實施云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日此間接巴黎方面消息、謂法政府之意志、對於洛迦諾公的國英法意此四國在倫敦商妥之協定、無論如何、法國决不絲毫讓步、德國必須接受之、或拒絕之、倫敦各代表團聞此消息大為驚駭、又聞法外長佛蘭亭曾稱、渠不欲返倫敦討論德國之答案、倫敦各代表團現覺此種態度將危及全局、且使與德國妥恊為實際不可能、官場尚未宣布此種消息、惟已言及佛蘭亭與比相齊倫决不返倫敦、對於德國答案之任何談判、將由尋常外交途徑進行之、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　法外長佛蘭亭拒絕考慮德國對四國備忘録所提出任何　答案之消息、傳至此間、政界殊為震動、而視佛蘭亭之態度興英外相艾登昨在下院所發之言論相牴觸、蓋英外相在院述及四國備忘錄時、會有德政府如以為不能接受四國條件而提出答案、英政府願予歡迎之言也、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國今日準備應付德元首希特勒拒絕羅卡諾公的國之建議、總理薩勞外長佛蘭亭及其他閣員今日討論今後應採之行動、官方聲稱、英比意如不欲擁護法國之立場、則法國即將單獨實施對德經濟制裁、使德國無法獲得必要之外國資金云、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今日下院開會時、首相包爾溫答覆關於歐洲時局之問話、謂英政府之主要目的、為維持條的尊嚴之原則、外相艾登答另一問話、謂渠與德總代表里賓特羅浦將軍談話之際、會切實聲明所致里氏之公文、其內容係建議性質、又曰、余曾說明英政府希望德政府能予接受、英政府在任何事變中覺德政府對英政府作建設性貢獻以改善時局之工作、應予輔助、駐柏林英大使曾奉余之訓令、以同樣語言面向德外長說明、德政府之覆文現尚未到達云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　掌熏大臣海里發斯、為參加巴黎倫敦兩處四國討論之英代表之一、昨日在白里斯托爾演說、謂吾人不欲包圍德國、亦不欲成立秘密條的、但欲得德國可自由加入之歐洲合作耳、洛迦諾公的簽字國對德提出之建議、並不為德國所須接受之哀的美頓書、但若在任何方面德政府認為不能接收、則簽的國當然可請德政府提出同樣有效之其他方法、以表示德國對於此事解决之眞正貢獻、就英政府而言、德國之任何答案、定可得極審愼之考慮、英國朝野之唯一願望、在行使其全部勢力、以期保持歐洲和平、而造成以尊重條的與相互諒解為根據之和平、此為英國外交政策之精髓云、海氏言及德代表里賓特羅浦在國聯行政院會議時所陳說之德方理由、謂德代表之言論、固有可引起許多方面同情之處、但無論英人對其所言有何同情、英人尊重法律之觀念、終不能不斥責直接破壞法律之行為、法比因德國進兵萊茵而發生之焦慮、與憤懣、渠了解之、且與之同情、如第一危機能以消減、則致之者為法比二國之忍耐、興英外相艾登謀取雙方良好諒解之不懈的努力云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　英國外相艾登、本日午後曾在下議院發表宣言、中有一段、謂「余前與德國出席國聯行政院代表里本特洛浦談話時、曾吿以羅卡諾會議協定草案具有建議性質」云云、此間外交部負責人士、因恐艾登此言、或足以啟人誤會、而以為協定草案、可由羅卡諾公的各簽字國重行考廬、頃特聲明法國政府並無重行考慮、協定草案之意、蓋外交部長佛蘭亭、日前已在眾議院聲明此案係一整個的接受、或拒絕、當全部為之、故在德國提出確實答復（指接受或拒絕而言）之前、佛蘭亭並無前往倫敦之必要、此際即使德國提出對案、渠亦决不前往倫敦、與德國進行談判也、佛蘭亭現因述日勤勞、頗感疲乏、故定于明日往鄉間稍作休憩云、據本社外交訪員所知、比　國務總理齊蘭、亦與佛蘭齊採取同一態度、即德國若果提出對案、齊蘭總理决不重返倫敦加以討論是也、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　行政院原定於本日午後、討論羅卡諾四國協定、茲因德國代表里本特洛浦未必及時趕到、或將展期開會、又據本社特派員所知、意國政府對於此項恊定、遲遲不加批准、要亦為行政院延會理由之一、大抵意相墨索里尼、係欲利用此項機會、作為討價還價之具、該國業已明白要求撤消制裁手段、以為恢復英法意三國斯特萊柴聯合陣錢之交換條件、各觀察家聲稱、關於對德採取強制手段、遣派國際軍隊佔據萊茵河區域各項辦法意國從未自動參加、則以去年國聯會對意實施制裁之後、德國并未照辦、意國乃欲藉此機會、加以報答也云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫、對於羅卡諾會議所提恊定草案、曾加以訾議、謂「意大利至今尚未正式參加、故此項草案、僅有臨時性質」云云、法國外交部政治司帮辦司長馬西格利、當於本日午後代表該國不管部閣員彭古、訪問意思大使格蘭第、請意國政府對於協定草案、儘速提出答復、藉使李維諾夫無復異議云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>中央大學文學院敎授孫本文</p>
<p>二，靑年對社會的責任靑年在社會上的地位，旣然如此重耍；故其所負資任，亦非常重大。靑年對於社會的責任，簡單說來，可分兩大端：即對於社會的過去，應負發揚的責任；對於社會的未來，應負建設的責任。</p>
<p>第一，對於社會的過去，負發揚的責任；　中國社會，在過去遺留不少的專蹟，值得我人表揚，其可舉者有三：</p>
<p>中國具有悠久的歷史中國歷史的悠久，在現代文明國家中，爲任何國家所不及。我們知道，古代世界的文化中心有四，即埃及，巴比倫，中國，即度。而現在巍然獨立於世界者惟有中國。近代歐洲國家，如英，如法，如德，如意，其形成時期，大率在中國唐宋以後。至德意兩國的獨立統一，且爲不足百年之事。美國的獨立，亦纔及一百六十年。我中國五千年來，雖朝代更替，變亂相尋；且兩度爲外族所蹂躪；但文化史蹟，未嘗中斷。這是我們</p>
<p>中國具有特性的文化　中國之所以能具有如此悠久的歷史，必有其不可磨滅的根本原因在。此根本原因，據我們分析，即在於中國具有特性的文化。此種特性的文化，使中國整個社會，形成精神上極鞏固的團結，且能因時勢的需要，而爲自動的適應。故中國社會，在過去雖偶有盛襄現象，而根本上未嘗動搖。至少在與西洋交通以前，確係如此。此種特性的文化，簡單說來，有三種基本型式：即家族本位，修身本位，中庸本位是。</p>
<p>（甲）家族本位的文化家挨爲中國社會組織的單位，其間包括父族，母挨，妻族，即合血親與姻親而言。家族關係，爲中國社會上人與人間相互關係的範型。社會上一切關係，都集中於家族。再出家族推而廣之，以至於社會國家。故孫中山先生說：『中國人最崇拜的是家族主義和宗族主義』。又說：『中國人對於家族和宗族的團結力，非常强大。一而維持此家族組織的團結力的基本精神，就是孝。凡修己治人之道，莫不以孝爲基本。故孝經云：『夫孝德之本也』。又云：『夫孝天之經也，地之義也，民之行也。論語亦云：『孝弟也者，其爲人之本歟』。除孝以外，家族道德尚有弟，慈等等，即所謂親親之義。但親親之義，不僅及於生存者爲止，並推而至於已亡故的祖先，於是有祖先崇拜。如中席云：『事死如事生，事亡如事存，孝之至也。論語亦云：』愼終追遠，民德歸厚矣。』由孝這種基本道德出發，推而至於家族以外，於是有忠愛君國之心。孝經云：『君子之專親孝，故忠可移於君。』又云：『以孝事君則忠』。大學云：『孝者所以事君也』。要之忠即孝之推廣。古代有君主，故忠君；在現代即爲忠於國，忠於領袖。再推而至於一般社會，乃有民胞物與的精神。孟子云：『親親而仁民，仁民而愛物。』云：『幼吾幼以及人之幼，老吾老以及人之老。』大學云：『弟者所以事長也，慈　所以使眾也。』皆所以推親親之道以及於社會。此種以家族爲本位推而至於國家社會的過程，即爲『會家治國　天下』多大道。不過實際上中國向來只做到家族的一級，自家族以外，僅成爲一種理想。故孫中先生說：『中國人的團結力祇能及於宗族而止，還沒有擴張到國族。』欲恢復國家固有的地位，我們現在必須如孫先生所說：『要善用中國固有的團體，像家族團體和宗挨團體，大家聯合起來，成一個大國族團體。』</p>
<p>（乙）脩身本位的文化脩身爲中國社會倫理的基本，耶個人修養的範型。家族關係，是就人對人而言；脩身是就對已而言。社會上如人人修身，那末，家無不齊，國無不治。所以大學云：『身脩而後家齊，家齊而　國治。』又云：『自天子以至於庶人，壹是皆以脩身為本。』按大學上所定的條目有八，，即格物，致知，誠意，正心，脩身，齊家，治國，平天下。前五者是就對已言，後三者是就對人言。所以脩身本位的文化，與家族本位的文化，原係一貫。不過脩身本位的文化，為家挨本位的文化的基礎而已。脩身的步驟為格物，致知誠意，正心；而脩身的方法，外乎克已復禮。在外當以禮義為規範，在內當有克已之功夫。禮記云。：『人之所以為人者禮也』。但禮義必須實踐。故中庸云：『禮義三百，成　三千，待其人而後行。『實踐禮義，又必段克己。論語云：『克已復禮為仁』。又云：『非禮勿　，非禮勿職，非禮勿言，非禮勿動。『因為克已必段從日常生活做起。視職言動之禮，漉掃應對之節，都是克已的功夫。至克已的要點，在於謹獨與崇　。因為謹獨，所以大學云：『十目所視，十手所指，其嚴乎？』詩經云：『相在爾室，尚不愧於屋漏。』因為崇實，所以中庸云：『內省不疚，無惡於志。』孟子云：大反身而誠，樂莫大焉。『這樣由謹獨崇實以克已復禮而　脩身的目的，為個人修養的要旨，而保社會上人人所應取法的範型。以之敎子，師以之敎弟，歷數千年而未嘗大變。　實際上末必人人能完全實　，然已成爲社會上的一種基本文化，可無疑義。不過自海通以來，與西洋文化接觸，巳使本國修養標準發生變動了。</p>
<p>（丙）中庸本位的文化　中庸為中國社會治事處世的範型。家族與脩身，係就對人對己而言；中庸係就對事而言。中庸的意思，就是不偏不倚無過無不及之謂。稈子云：『中者天下之正道，庸者天卞之定理。』是中席即正道定理；所以含有合理的意義。合理是不容易的，所以中席云：『知者過之，愚者不及也；賢者過之，不肖者不及也；『又云：』中庸其至矣乎，民鮮能久矣。『又云。：』天下國家可均也；爵祿，可辭也；白刃，可蹈也；中庸，不可能也。『但中庸不僅合理，還須合時。所以中庸云：』君子之中席也，君子而時中。『時中即時時適中的意思；含有適應環境之義。論語云：』時然後言，人不厭其言。『孟子云：孔子聖之時者也。』此時字即時中之義，表明適應環境的意思。中庸旣爲適應環境，故有進化的意義。中國社會原是進化的，是由中席文化發嚴的結果。史書上說：三皇不沿樂，五帝不　禮。故夏尚忠，殷尚質，周尚文；惟以適應環境的需要而定。可見時代變遷，社會即改變以適應之，詩經云。：『周雖舊邦，其命維新。』大學云：『苟日新，日日新，又日新。』這就是說爲適應環境　維新；亦即含有進化的意思。又中席旣然是無過不及，即有中和之義。凡中和者必和平。世　中國民族爲和平的民族，即由於中庸文化的陶冶。嬰之，能中和合理以適應環境，即是中庸之道。中庸之道，爲中國社會治事處世的範型。但專實上非人人能循中屠之道，不過人人以此爲標準而已。</p>
<p>凡上所述三種基木文化，是中國所特有的。家族爲對人的範型，脩身爲對己的範型，中　爲對事的範型。綜合此三種範型，成一特殊的文化系統，爲中國文化的特色。這是我們應該　揚的第二點。（未完）</p>

<p>三月二十日上午六時、由漢乘粵漢鐵路輪船渡江、時大雪初齊、水定波澄、隔江柳色、爭送靑來、塵襟為之開朗、七時至武昌徐家棚上車、乘客殊甚擁擠、車箱設備簡陋、允不講求衛生、隨地吐痰、無人加以干涉、八時車徐徐開動、至點魚套站、又停一小時餘始開行、時車廂震盪甚劇、使人不耐、詢知該路枕木、多係民國三年初决通車時舊物、腐朽不堪、無怪其然、現粵漢全路通車在即、此段路務、須澈底加以整頓、車上允有一怪現象、為全國各路所無、即小販多至數十人、往來如織、高聲呌囂、如銅山東崩、洛鐘西應、迨查票員來時、則羣相趨避、有扒至車頂上者、敏捷如猿、查票員去、又　擁而下、乘客咸為之不安、此皆窮苦民眾、為飢寒所驅者、雖不必嚴予取締、亦似有加以的束之必要也、同車中有兩乘客、一着便裝、一着軍服、憲兵索閱護照、彼探懷出傳票一紙蓋係武昌縣政府差往山坡等處、催收錢糧者、余視其票、被傳者的數十人、余笑謂差等、此行當可大揩油水、渠等喟然太息謂此在前數年、自屬優差、今則鄉民皆無飯吃、何能供給分文、且謂同輩中、有出差挨餓者、信如其言、則官府亦怕民窮、閻王亦怕鬼瘦、而農村貧困之狀、可以想見一斑矣、</p>
<p>車至賀勝橋、已入咸寗界、為該縣較繁榮之市鎭、未幾至咸寗、城門緊對車站、城後有山高聳、一望而知為形勢之地、因急欲赴蒲圻、未克下車、車中遇一咸寗人、為談咸寗惟況甚詳、該縣為三等縣、面積一二五一方公里、耕地一二五四零四畝、人口的十四萬餘、東南常旱、西北苦水、（現因金水閘完成水患已減）且久遭匪患、一部份土地、曾被瓜分、保安隊。壯丁隊。剷共隊等、均已組織、保安團餉經臨兩項年需四萬一千元、由田畝。商舖。茶蔴紙三項徵捐支付、而武裝壯了隊之經費、更須人民自行負擔。現在西南柏墩。馬橋。與蒲屬之楊泉。板　接界地、尚有殘匪出沒、農產以紙茶蔴為大宗、造紙有紙廠、年造八萬塊、值五萬元、茶三萬擔、值二十萬元、蔴二萬擔、值四十餘萬元、近日出產既減、消路又滯、入民誠無法謀生矣、又詢禁煙與教育情形、據稱學校教育與社會教育、均談不上、煙禁似仍不免廢弛、但較前已有成績、</p>

<p>被人謀死</p>
<p>的、問、上决吳推事開庭、你如何不供呢、答、攸關顏面、所以未供、决據陸志良供、年五十八歲、崇明人、在電力公司服務、陳洪福是我外甥、他父母病歿時、洪福僅有十三歲、由我救濟他成人、又將田地八畝租與他耕種、自足國廿一年至廿三年、欠我三年租穀、我與洪福雖為甥舅、情同父子、洪福不知被何人謀死、我概不知悉、指我</p>

<p>是何用意</p>

<p>本市糧食一業，種類繁多，大別之可分為製造業與販賣業，而製造業中，復因商品種類之不同，又可分為麵粉，　皮及油餅等業。販賣業中除以商品分類外，復有牙行與零售之別，更因地域之各異，又可分為洋商與華商，本帮與客帮。因此，上海市糧食商之團體組織，亦即複雜異常，往往非業外人所能通曉，今就調查所得，姑分米業，麵粉麩皮業及雜糧油餅業三項述之。</p>
<h3 id="c157">一米業至商團組織 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>一，上海市荳米行業同業公會該會由荳業萃秀堂與米業仁穀堂兩公所合組而成。萃秀堂成立巳逾百年，為本市糧食業團體組織之　矢，即在全市各業公會中，亦未有先於斯者。荳業於淸代中葉，最為興盛，滬上通行之九八規元，即為其所創，故亦稱荳規元也。惟近年以來，漸形衰落，然迄今仍有使用其本票之權，，各業收支，流通市上，蓋其信譽，至今猶甚佳也。營業種類，為大荳，荳油，荳餅，雜糧，米等，允以油荳餅為主要品，故亦稱油荳餅業。貨品來源，大部為關東及山東沿海各地。該業因常與米業有連帶關係，故併稱為荳米業。往昔兩業均向上海縣轉領部帖執照，同為牙行種類中之莧米業一類也。</p>
<p>米業之仁穀堂公所，歷史亦頗久遠，然較萃秀堂為遲，蓋從荳米業中分化而成，故自昔迄今，凡事均雙方合作，一致進行。兩業之主持人，向例由一人兼任，前稱董事，今稱主席委員，現任主席，即為顧馨一氏。近二三十年來，米業之業務，逐步發展，而荳業則反見縮小。推其原因，荳業祗限於局部之油荳餅，而米業則除河下杜米，客米，洋米之外，其他花色雜糧均屬之。即以河下杜米一項而論，以滬上人口衆多，銷費額鉅大，全年營業，巳屬可觀，業務不同，有以致之云。</p>
<p>民國十八年以後，荳米行兩業公所，合併為一，另組上海市荳米行業同業公會，　總事務所於豫園萃秀堂，並在原有之仁穀堂及閘北兩處設南北市分事務所。附屬於該會者，尙有許多分支組織，茲略述如左：</p>
<p>一，南市荳米業米組發米分組會原名南市米</p>
<p>行公　，由滬南十六浦以南專營米糧之行商所組織，即俗稱發米行。會址在大東門外中華路仁穀堂原址內，現主任為朱子香氏。</p>
<p>二，北市荳米業米組發米分組會　原名北市米行公會，由滬北蘇州河北岸及滬西各專營米糧之行商所組織。新閘橋北堍為米行會聚處，前年最盛時共有三十六家之多，且均以米為主要業務業各地，貨及產區各商與經售人，亦羣集於斯，北市商業之興盛，該會實與有功焉。惟近兩年來，因戰事影響，巳略遜於前云。會址在閘北光復路長安路口，任主任為　梓生氏。</p>
<p>三，荳米業公磅處原稱仁　堂公磅處，荳米兩業合併後改稱今名，由米行業專營包子米及雜糧等商家所組織，並有不人米業公會之號商加入，由該處置備天平公磅，發給公用扦樣單據。地址則附設於仁堂原址云。</p>
<p>四，斛司工會由米行業所　之斛司所組織，斛司　斛米之工人，其地位甚為重要，行家視之，重要在學徒之上。其下另有茶役以供使用。全市有數白人，往年殊為散漫，並不團結。自米　重輕行使風潮發生後，隨忽　組織成立，迄今未及一戰。會址在閘北馬鎭路毓常東里　號，現任主席委　為劉龍翔氏。</p>
<p>除上述各團體外，其他由米行業單獨組織</p>
<p>或由荳米行業合組之公益事業團體，亦復不少：如學校，會館，卹養基金等分枝機關，早經次第設立。近年來復有倉庫，醫院，碼頭等之籌設，除米碼頭早告成立，倉庫於二十三年落成，並有同業公舉前大昌米行經理張升如為該庫主任外，其他則以時局不靖，籌費困難，尙有待也。</p>
<p>二，上海市碾米業同業公會該會於民國七年二月二十一日，在米行業仁穀堂公所正式成立，當時定名為上海機器碾米公所，會員不限組織之大小，而祗須在上海境內經營機器碾米之事業者，均得加入，採用會長制。惟現在則巳改名為上海市碾米業同業公會，會長制亦改為主席委員。前後組織，均仿照米行業公會辦法；因此中主持人，大部份均係兼營米行業者，現任主席為新昌碾米廠主朱子香氏。會址在閘北庫倫路二一二號。</p>
<p>市內碾米廠最近的有五十家左右，雖規模較大者均早入會，而　經加入者亦復不少。其業務多兼營米業，自行碾白；，如專營代客碾米者，實居少數。此外亦有與行號特的，乃專碾客路從和等者。其中以新昌資本數厚，有米機八座，其次為振興和記等三四家云。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c158">棉布和農村經濟的關係 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 筱石</p>
<p>棉布的種類，大別凡三；一為用機器製的，一一為用新式機製的，三為農家出品。機器和新式機製的棉布，其原料完全採用機紗，農家出品，大概半機紗而半自紡的紗。這三種棉布，都為人生日常必需的衣料，苟人人能採用國產棉布，則農村經濟，就會呈蓬勃氣象。中國為農業國，向來耕織並重，所謂「男耕女織」，是農家經營生產的原則。內地農村，至今還有一種普遍的習慣，凡嫁女者，無論貧富，必製布衣若干件，布被若干條，棉布若干疋，以多為貴，有「外婆傳娘娘傳女」的土諺，以為美談，農人之重視棉布，於此可見。</p>
<p>徐公橋舉行農家經濟調查，全區七百二十戶，三千五百三十六人，有紡機一千零四十二部，織機四百八十一部，每年棉布產量，九千三百八十七疋，價值九千三百八十七元。最近滬郊改進區調查，全區九百四十四戶，四千九百零四人，織布婦女，有八百六十二入，每年棉布收入價值，六千七百五十元。據這兩個統計以觀，可見織布，實為農村婦女的專業，雖布價低落，無利可圖，而村中女子，還是孜孜不倦，從事紡織。我們應該怎樣來護助倡？以維持她千鈞一髮的生機。</p>
<p>昔年遊江陰，大街小巷，機聲不絕，織機多老數十乘，乃至數百乘，少者一二乘，或三四乘，織布的工人，女子之外，還有大多數的男子。於此允可見內地農村，不但女子恃織布為業卽以織布為業的男子，亦大有人在。上海董家渡有專製舊式梭子者，營業甚佳，由小販批售於各地鄉村。浦東一帶，以織布為副業的女子，還是十佔八九，三林塘土布，極有名於時。吾舉出這幾個例子就是告訴大家，棉布在農村所佔她位的重要，希望大家愛用國產棉布，以維持農村的生活。</p>
<p>最近有一位鎭平朋友，特在浦東採辦人工紡紗的脚車，因為浦東的脚車，一人同時能紡三支紗，不比蘇錫一帶的手紡車，一人僅能紡一支紗。這位朋友說，內地婦女，從事紡織，足以維持其一人最低限度的生活。可見農村織布，不但要維持其現狀，且有盡力推廣的必要。不過工業的盛衰，要看銷路的如何，倘然各地愛國的同胞，一致注意這農村棉布問題，樂用國產棉布，農村經濟，就可蓬蓬勃勃。故吾的結語，「多用一匹國產棉布，就可多帮助一個平民的生計。」</p>
<h3 id="c159">怎樣保持出超 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>我國自有海關以來，每年冊子上只有龐大的入超數字，却從來沒有一文的出超，以致一般本來大聲疾呼提倡國貨的熱心份子，也往往以毫無成績而灰心後退。於是國貨運動的陣錢，愈趨散漫，同時國人所受五分鐘熱度的　笑，也已不止一决了。</p>
<p>年來我國一般先知先覺的人們，因為威到經濟救國的重要，所以對于提倡國貨的運動，也正比例地加緊努力。雖則什麽婦女國貨年，學生國貨年，並沒有顯著的成績，但他們並不後退，再不陷過去五分鐘熱度的覆轍，終究他們是勝利了。據報載去年十二月份滬市對外貿易輸入總數，為三千六百八十四萬九千九百四十九元，出口總值為三千七百九十三萬二千五百六十六元，出超額為一百零八萬二千六百十七元，這眞是自有海關以來的第一决。無疑地這是我們榮譽的一頁，是一般熱心國運努力的收獲！</p>
<p>不過一個月的出超，是終難祗補十一個月的入超的。所以我們現在唯一的責任，就是要再下怎樣的决心與努力，務求每個月的冊子上，都是出超的紀錄，永久一變入超國為出超國，那才是我們最後的成功呀！</p>
<p>憑良心說一句：中國現在的貨品，較之往昔，確已有驚人的進步，所以十二月份海關冊子上的突轉出超，雖說是一般人內心的覺悟，對于國家觀念，漸深的表示，但也未始不是因為已有相當代替品供給了的緣故罷！所以我們要求永保持出超的數字，一方面固然要鼓勵國人服用國貨，一方面還要獎勵工業，使中國貨品，反勝外貨，那末人民自也樂于服用國貨了。素居于入超國的我國，不難就一變而永為出超國了！</p>
<p>最後作者認為現在國難是萬分的嚴重，生在特殊環境下的我國，欲抒國難，根本還談不到利用武力，所以只有提倡國貨，是無須受到外力無理的干涉與阻撓的，但人人為能實行，必足致敵人于死命，同胞們，這是我們整個民族當前唯一的出路，大家起來努力吧！</p>
<h3 id="c160">提倡土貨與提倡國貨 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 影父</p>
<p>提倡土貨；以培養農村經濟，確是當前救國的實力準備，意義是多麽重大。</p>
<p>時賢邰爽秋等幾位先生，因此有「土貨年」之發起，並訂定十年進行計劃，喚起民衆共同推進。據這幾位先生的估計，單就在農村提倡手紡手織之土布而言，使三萬萬農民，於五個月之農閒時間，從事於此，就拿每天可賺二分來說，每年所得，亦達九萬萬元之譜。這就可見在這非常時期提倡土貨是具有怎樣的重要性了。</p>
<p>提倡土貨和提倡國貨，可說是復興民族經濟運動的左右翼，朝着共通的目標前進，然而提倡土貨，比提倡國貨，更來得嚴格，更容易發揮實效。為的是：今日之所謂國貨，（指機製洋式貨而言），因其仿製洋貨，所以和舶來品很難區別，這便發生辨別上的困難，同時就原料上觀察，所謂國貨，每多有洋貨的成分參雜其間，土貨便少這個弊病。</p>
<p>因此又覺得提倡土貨實施委員會宣言裏所指出的幾句，很值得我門的重視：</p>
<p>「我們堅决主張提倡鄉下自用土貨，提倡城裏人購用土貨，我們希望士貨上城，不希望國貨下鄉，我們希望一般企業家到鄉下去發展合作農村生產，不要把鄉下的銀子吸收到城裏來開工廠，使農村金融枯竭。」</p>
<h3 id="c161">貢獻給我國紙傘業 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 抱月</p>
<p>我國的紙傘，製法雖然很古，但是到現在還是相當的切合於實用。在過去時代，紙傘是我國人人不可少的雨具，自從有了舶來品的「洋傘」輸入，一般人因為趨尙洋化的嗜好，漸漸地被目為落伍的用品，使紙傘業受到極大的打擊。</p>
<p>在南洋所暢銷的國產品中，紙傘也是大宗之一。南洋土人的所以樂用我國的紙傘，當然不僅是為了經濟，並且遮陽避雨也都合宜。因而使紙傘至現今還是能在南洋暢銷，還是覺得這是需要的用品。</p>
<p>近年來雖有日本產的雨遮輸入南洋，因為不能像我國產的紙傘那樣的耐用，所以影響我國紙傘在南洋的銷路尙微。不過近代的南洋土人，已不似過去那般的愚頑，因為世界物質文明的潮流的侵入，頭腦漸新，智識漸增，一切工業也都有相當的進步。看到紙傘的能够暢銷市上，有利可圖。已自行創設了製傘的工廠，自然將來，我國紙傘在南洋的銷路，難免不因此蒙到重大的打擊。</p>
<p>南洋三寳壠中華商會，駐和屬各領館，和巴達維亞華商雜貨公會等，曾都有函致我國外交部，請我國製傘工業注意南洋銷路前途的可憂，以謀改良競爭。運到南洋去銷售的紙傘，都是溫州產，照最近溫州傘出口較前漸减的情形看來，前途確已大堪憂慮，當然應該在未受到重大影饗以前，亟圖挽救，纔不難恢復市塲原狀。不過我國製傘工人，大多只知墨守舊法，很少有研究改良的能力，而今為了將來的生活打算，自然他們必定很願意，並很希望外界貢獻意見。</p>
<p>我以為製傘工人最低應該注意的，是怎樣設法减輕成本，和力求美觀。此外，材料方面，應用國產棉紙製造，因為比外國牛皮紙堅靸耐用。竹骨應用秋冬之竹，使得可以避免蟲蠹的發生。生油有膠黏性，容易破爛，應用上等桐油。製造方面，裝附傘骨的有齒形木頭，和所繫紗綫，應加改良。刷油後應陰乾。未乾的紙傘，不可裝箱。關於這幾點，希望我國紙傘業加以參考，對於工作的改良上，都是切於實際的。</p>
<p>來函</p>
<h3 id="c162">貢獻意見 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>編輯先生：我對於國貨日用品有幾點意見，請代發表如下：</p>
<p>熱水瓶　現巳行銷窮鄕僻壤，用者稱便，可是長長的形式，放在桌上，往往使人怕牠倒下來打個粉碎，這句話是可以表示一般用者的心理的，最好請製造者改良，只要把「瓶壳底內加銲一圓塊鉛」，那就能放置穩妥了。至於瓶口漏水的毛病，熱心牌的瓶，已經改良，不用再說了。</p>
<p>賽璐珞用品大中華的出品最有名，可惜多是小孩玩具（民窮財盡，幾個人買他？）又像日本用賽璐珞做的懷中記事片，簡直沒有人想法仿做，這種片子不過三吋見方，用鉛筆寫了字在上面，隨後可用橡皮擦去可以永用。居家時出外前要作何事都可以預先記好，臨時有事要記下來，懷中拿出也很便當。假使刻上恭賀新禧又可賀年，寄給朋友，收到的人，也可作別用丁。希望廠家倣造，倒是可以獲利的。</p>
<p>搪瓷用品　近年國貨出品之精美，足與外貨並駕齊驅，種類也很多，獨有家常炒菜用的鍋子，沒有製出來。按外貨有一種搪瓷鍋。和中國鐵鍋的形式一樣，只因為是雙料的，外面有搪瓷，日久却燒不壞，且不怕易燒壞鍋壺一類的煤火，希望廠家製造出來，為消費最大的我國各家庭謀節省經濟之福利。此祝撰安羅叔彝啟</p>

<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>上海學校樹立，即以外國僑民所設立之學校而論，亦屬爲數不少。年來國內各地敎育界人士來滬參觀敎育者，每慾一睹外人學校之設施概況，藉作他山之名，惟以語言及時間種種關係，常不能窺其全豹。現特介紹上海美國學校概況一篇，以作敎育界人士之參考，其他各國僑民在滬所設立之學校概況，容後陸續發表。本文承上海美國學校校長威爾斯博士，多方供給材料，並承惠贈該校校舍鳥瞰圖一張，特此誌謝！（編者附誌）</p>
<p>一·在華最大的美童學校</p>
<p>上海美國學校是美國僑民在華爲本國子弟所創辦最大的美童學校。在華各省的美僑都有子弟送入該校肄業，來校學省以僑住上海者爲最多，其他來自江蘇，廣東，福建，浙江，海南，山東，香港，雲南，安徽，河南，湖北，江西，滿洲等處者亦有。</p>
<p>該校成立於西歷一千九百一十二年九月十七日，最初十由美國駐華三個敎會與青年會工作人員中一部份家長組織的，那時在美國紐約成立董事會主持一切校務。該校　辦的宗旨時認為一個美國的兒童，假如要養成他成為一個最有用的美國公民，是應該在一個美國的學校中由美國的敎師用美國的理想與傳統概念敎育的。學校的編制包括完全小學及高初兩級中學。</p>
<p>該校創辦時規模頗小，在北四川路賃屋作爲校舍，第一學期只有學生三十八人。一九二三年九月，該校遷到現在的新址，就是在法租界貝當路十號。新校舍場地寬大，佔地約九十三八。因此學生人數，校舍建築與設備添置年來均有莫大的發展。最初入學的兒童多來自在華敎會與商業的家庭，所以一九二一年在上海成立的一個執行部，由在華敎會與商業界推選相等數的代表共同負責維持校務，而美國紐約則成立了永久的董事會保管一切校務。董事會與執行部的委員都是由有關係的團體中推選，每年局部地改選一次。</p>

<p>金錢，勢力，是相互表裹的，有金錢而無勢力，譬如三條腿的牛站不穩，有勢力而無金錢，猶似兩隻脚的虎跳不動，要金錢和勢力混合在一起，纔做得成事，害得了人。</p>

<p>春日萬紫千紅，固可令人賞心悅目；然亦有　子思歸，對花惆悵感嘆的。百花之中，最足引起人們離思的，莫如杜鵑花。李白在宣城，見了杜鵑花，就詠著一首詩道：</p>
<p>「蜀國曾聞子規鳥，宣城還見杜鵑花。一呌一回腸一斷，三春三月憶三巴。」</p>
<p>按子規鳥，一名杜鵑鳥。鳴時，其聲凄厲，彷彿在喚「不如歸去」已足動旅客歸思：更何况那杜鵑花兒開遍山谷，見之自無怪令人耍腸斷了。</p>
<p>杜鵑又名山石榴。白居易寄元九詩，有云：「商山秦嶺愁殺人，山石榴花紅夾路！」這亦是說杜鵑花要引起人愁緒的。</p>
<p>還有一則故事，則是極哀感頑艷之致了。琅環記云：</p>
<p>「昔有人飮於錦城謝氏，其女窺而悅之。共人聞子規啼，卽謝去。女恨甚，後聞子規啼，則怔忡若豹鳴也；使侍女以竹枝驅之，曰：「汝尚敢至此啼乎！」！故名子規爲謝豹」。</p>
<p>這故事雖似與杜鵑花無關；然杜鵑盛開之時，卽子規悲啼之候，故杜鵑花又名謝豹花，見格物編。</p>
<p>在唐時，杜鵑花似乎是很名貴的。王建宮詞云：</p>
<p>「太儀前日暖房來，屬昭陽乞藥栽；敕賜一窠紅躑躅，謝恩未了奏花開」按杜鵑花，一名山躑躅，亦見格物編。</p>
<p>與這詩相映成趣的，有白居易戲問山石榴詩云：</p>
<p>「小樹山榴近砌栽，半含紅蕚帶花來：爭知司馬夫入妬，移向庭前便不開」。</p>
<p>前詩說「謝恩未了奏花開」，是何等欣喜！這詩說「移向庭前便不開」，是何等澳喪！白先生的老婆，恐伯是隻雌老虎呢！</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>他雖然也是一個小工出身的，但現在他是「那麼溫」了。他是一個「那麽溫」，是那一羣小工中的頭見腦兒。雖然他的肩見上，從前也是擱過槓棒見的，他的腿上，從前也挨過籐條兒的，但現在，他是手指兒不觸槓棒了。在熱天，穿起了拷香雲紗短衫袴。在寒天，穿起了馬袴呢的夾大衣。嘴裏咬着雪茄烟，手裏握着籐鞭兒，在一大羣小工中，踱到東，再踱到西的踱着。不時的抓着張三駡幾聲，或是把籐鞭兒在李四腿上揍兩下。</p>
<p>「那麽溫，近來貨物那麼多，件頭又大，我們這幾個小工一班，實在的有些吃不消，求你老做做好事，求大班再添幾個人一班罷。」一天，小工要求着。</p>
<p>「放屁，誰說吃不消，誰便滾蛋，得啦。你們這種話，給大班得知了，準會全體撬照會。大班還在說呢，這年頭見掙不到錢，正在想减掉幾個一班咧。」那麽溫冷笑着說。</p>
<p>過了幾天，又有人要求着：「那麽溫，現在甚麼東西都是那麼貴，我們一天幹着十二小時，還是拿不到六毛小洋錢，害病一天，還得扣去四毛，實在的不够生活，求你老發發慈悲，照着行裏的數目，每天十足的發給七毛大洋罷。那麼溫，做做好事，天保佑你的二姨太太，今年生個大胖兒子。」</p>
<p>「你們這是說的甚麽話？行裏發出來，是每工四毛八分大洋錢，誰說的是七毛大洋？誰說七毛大洋的，就請他來當那麼溫。……哼，告訴你們罷，那邊十四號碼頭翻造時，有六百多小工來向我接頭，每人打三百元舖保，每天五毛小洋的工資。我瞧着你們也都是可憐見的，所以沒答應他們。我瞧着你們還是安分些兒罷。給大班知道了，準得全體撬照會。爲首的，還得坐外國牢監。到那時，才吃不了，兜着走呢。」</p>
<p>營業是一天發達似一天。到後來？大班也覺得非增加一班小工，是不行了。於是便命那麽溫，增加一班。但是那麽溫，却並不另行招工，就把原有的日夜二班小工，每名增加工作六小時，增加工資小洋三毛。但這是那麼溫對於小工的特別恩典，所以都很自願地履行那麽溫提出的每名抽取小洋半角的條件。因爲小工們，有的是勞力，多做六小時，是滿不在乎，究竟每天多做六小時，是有二毛半小洋的收入的呢。</p>
<p>但是過了不上三個月，那麽溫又娶了一位三姨太太了。</p>

<p>祗要認識王老師的人，誰都要稱讚他一聲博學多能，是當世的敎育家；每一個學生祗要提起王老師，大家立刻會連想起，大名鼎鼎的楊編輯，因爲，王老師在上國文課的時候，每三句總要提出一句楊編輯，譬如：這話是我的朋友楊編輯講的，這書是楊編輯送給我的等等。</p>
<p>校長也遷就王老師，呈文不能不仰仗王老師的大筆，倒不是王老師的公文程式有研究，校長明知他等因時常弄錯，但敎部局長却是王老師的同學，王老師起草呈文上去，的確沒有批駁過，別人擬的稿上去倒難說。</p>
<p>王老師的好處就在那一副和合臉，總是那麽笑嘻嘻的，對同事固然異常客氣，對學生也不爲難，月考年考他總看報，分數少也要奉送六十分，閒來還肯講講紅樓夢，所以學生很是欽佩。</p>
<p>有一次，督學來視察，不幸王老師把「兢兢業業」讀成了「競競業業」，退了課督學向他請敎，他還是那麼笑嘻嘻尊崇督他爲「一字之師」結果，不久敎育局傳令嘉獎，王老師所得評語是：一學識優長，敎學有方」。</p>

<p>假使有機會的話，我也想到蘭州去一趟。聽說那邊對於江南去的人，多少總有些法子可想的。我不及張先生，到底還得了一個職務。介夫道：唉！我們來的目的，也不僅是如此呀。志前聽了這話，沒有作聲，只是微笑。看到有容同成郭二人站在車邊說話，也就迎上前去。有容指着這長途汽車前面，另一輛車子道：你們路上不寂寞了。那一輛車子，也是到蘭州去的。志前向前面看時，正是那兩位德國人培爾同威廉，那德國通趙國富，也站在一處。，他看到志前，遠遠的點了一個頭。志前低聲道：這不用說，他們是到蘭州去兜攬賣汽車的。道可見交通到了什麽程度，外貨也就推銷到什麽程度，常科長徵微的幌着頭，抖了一句文道：我能往寇　能往。郭卓然道：我們走罷。我的意思，今天還想趕到賓縣。志前於是手上取了帽子，走上車去，向四周拱着手，道是再見再見。相送的人，也都脫帽子搖着相答。正在這時，有一輛長途車子也停在小西天門口。車門開了，穿西裝的，穿長衫馬褂的，還有穿小袖子旗袍的太太，紛紛下來。有人說，到了西安了，這就是小西天。志前正打量着他們，石公正在他身邊坐着的，却笑到程先生他們點了一個頭，他們已是深深的同鞠了一個躬。志前點頭道：好，一　喜劇完了。那汽車喇叭，嗚的一聲，好像答應一聲「不」！可是車子隨了這聲喇叭，向一百零八八站的大道邁述，以後完與不完，誰知道呢？（完）</p>

<p>— （謝澐）</p>
<p>是一個風和日暖的初春下午，我由眞如搭着蒸汽車（小火車）到上海去，車輪降隆的在鐵軌上旋轉，我憑着車窗，眺望遠處的房屋，工廠烟突中的煤烟，隨着風勢游龍似的飄渺空中，天色蔚藍一碧，景象是美麗；汽車駛過中山路後，將近閘北太陽廟臨時車站的時候，遠遠地望着有兩個黑色長形包裏似的東西，橫躺在鐵路枕木的旁邊車輪緩緩的駛過時，向下一望，赫然是兩個已殤的嬰孩，一個比較大一點，一個似乎出世不久，赭紅色的臉兒，覆着褐色稀疏的毛髮，無聲無息地躺在包裏中；不知是誰家私生子，還是死後無力埋藏，遺棄於此；車輪轆轆的繼續前進，把這一幅觸目驚心的悲劇，拋向後面，這時我的心兒突突的跳着和着旋轉的車輪相應和這兩個小小的生　，已失却他們的生命力了，這只能怪他生在可憐的中國，社會無力去養育他們，只好棄之如遺唾；看許多强壯活潑的靑年，犧牲在飢餓兵匪下，不知其數，何况這乳毛未乾，無抵抗一切侵襲力的小生命呢？假使他們是生在强盛的國家，此時正在育嬰所撫養的時期，何致死後都無人埋葬？</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3 id="c221">食物怎樣變爲血肉 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 胡楚玉</p>
<p>我們每天吃了食物，才能够維持生命，不會餓死。但是吃了食物之後，在身體內究竟發生什麼樣子，就是怎樣消化，又經過消化吸收的養分，　怎樣變成血肉筋骨呢？這一點常識，我們應常明白的。大概食物到了我們的體內，過了數小時，就變化其原來的形體，和本質，在體內的一部，成了各式各樣的東西，其中變化的微妙，簡單的一句話，就是靠「酸酵素』的力而活動的。現在我把變化的經過，簡略的說明一下。</p>
<p>我們每次吃了食物，那食物到了胃中，胃液中有一種「彼浦新」Pepsin。醱酵素，得了鹽酸的助，先把食物的蛋白質發生作用，變爲、「彼布東」Pepton，就是把蛋白質分解，成爲「阿彌諾酸」，再到腸裹，從膵臟分泌出了膵液中的「德里浦新」醱酵素，有這醱酵素，於是蛋白質愈加容易消化了。又在膵液中與他的醱酵素「亞麻拉舍一作用，變爲澱粉被其吸收，成爲糖類，同時有一種醱酵素「利巴舍」與從膽囊中所出的膽汁，管理很强的脂肪消化作甩，而在腸內的腸液，含有醱酵素「愛來勃新」因「彼沛新」「德里沛新」的作用，到了某程度，把被消化的蛋白質，更加徹底的分解，成爲阿彌諾酸，這樣我們的消化器管中，是非常的起了高度的分業消化作用了。照上面樣子消化吸收的營養分，受血液的作用，分送到身體各部分，到了種種的組織，與已經存在於各部的醱酵素相合成，其葡萄糖，成爲「葛利哥根」Glykogen（是無色無味無臭非結晶一種東西存在人體的筋肉肝臟中間，倘若到了饑餓疲勞的時候，就要消耗减少的）那阿彌諾酸，就是變爲筋肉，又溶解於與他的有機物質結合的水分相逢，在骨的表面的醱酵素「福司法太含」而分解，成爲「燐酸加爾秀姆」就是變形爲骨了。我們當勞動的時候，是要用精力（Eoergie）的，可是精力是怎樣出的呢？就是精力，因筋肉中的「葛利哥根」的燃燒，（燃燒二字，並不是像焚木炭出火與出高溫，是我們身體上的體溫攝氏三十七度左右而然燒的）先把葛利哥根，以醱酵素的作用，成爲葡萄糖，因酸化醱酵素的力起了燃燒作用。然而普通的葡萄糖爲白色結晶體，本來須要二百度以上的熱力，才會燃燒，而身體內的體溫，祇有三十七度，爲什麽燃燒呢？這是因爲不可思議的醱酵素的作用而起的。平日我們由生活而動作（如手足的運動）必要酸化醱酵素的工作，所以心臟的筋肉中，晝夜不停的勞動，這是因爲有强力的酸化酵素存在的緣故的。至於醱酵素，若在攝氏八十度以上的熱度，那就失去作用力了。又從植物的生長說起來，其種子堅硬如石，受了適當的溫度與水分，就會發芽，成長之後，變爲摩天的喬木，這種不可思議的現象，也是醱酵素的作用，造成莖葉枝幹啊。</p>

<h3 id="c233">縱火焚燒棚户事件 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>閘北裕通路棚户，近來屢决被地主迫令遷移，我們正在替那幾百家窮入呌苦。不意前日（七日）早晨，該處草棚，忽先後遭人縱火焚燒兩决，這更是他們的不幸。這决禍事雖未至釀成大患，但從事件的本身上看，却是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>首先我們要說的，是關於迫遷這件事。該處空地，爲某地主所借讓。現在因地主欲建造房屋，故有迫遷之舉。但該地棚户，都係來自各地難民。一旦拆屋還地，勢必樓身無處。故一經地主驅逐，莫不惶惶不安。於是乃聯名呈請黨政當局，乞爲設法救濟，並籲求地主從緩迫遷。從地主方面說，該處空地，旣爲自己所有，借讓是他的善舉，討還也是他的權利。故迫令遷徙，原屬正當之事。但從棚户方面說，棚户皆係窮人，他們只有草棚住得起，並無餘錢可租屋。一令遷移，要呌他們住到那里去？故乞請從緩迫遷，也是萬不獲已的。而今地主去一再催迫，未免太不顧念貧人的苦况。</p>
<p>其次耍提的，卽是縱火焚屋這案件。這决縱火的，究係何人，在眞相未明之先，是無從知道的。但我們雖不敢斷定犯罪者爲何人，或爲何人所敎唆。惟這案伴與迫令遷屋之事有關，該是無疑的。這里有幾點證據。縱火是發生在索地之後。無故縱火之事，想是不會有的。在棚户呈文中，也指出幾個嫌疑人。要是我們的猜測是不錯的，那末這事情的重大，是很顯然的了。</p>
<p>關於這事件的處置，我們有三項意見。第一是嚴懲肇禍者。故意縱火焚屋　，這犯的是刑事罪。這决火災，幸撲滅得早，故被燒草棚，只有十餘間。若不幸任其延燒，禍患必不堪設想。不但全部草棚，有被焚燬的可能。卽幾百條住户生命，也有被燒斃的危險。故當局對於這事，應嚴緝肇禍者，並调查背後的主使人，治以應得之罪。第二是地主迫令棚户遝徙，雖屬合理。但應寬限時日，俾各棚各另謀安身之處。這於窮人生活，關係不少。故地主不宜迫之過甚，當局也應從中調解。第三是希望當局能體念民艱，對於該處住户，代爲設法安置，以資救濟。</p>
<h3 id="c234">巡长 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 東光</p>
<p>走出胡老南瓜的寳局來，外面仍然細叢叢的下着小雨，春日的傍晚一轉眼就天黑了。街上冷寂寂的沒有行人，車路上滿變成了水窪和泥潭，兩旁的店舖都高掛起大美孚燈來，舖伙們都痴呆呆的伏在櫃台邊，靜看着街心中迷霧樣的雨景。</p>
<p>雨細茸茸的飄着，微小的水滴每吹到發燒的面皮上，便凉陰陰的使人感到一陣爽快，劉玉昌移動着他那矮胖身子，打我頭前走，他穿着那套才發下來的黃軍裝，把帽子歪嵌到額角上，喝醉了酒似的，一邊搖搖擺擺的邁着步子，一邊用他那沙嗓子唱「寡婦思春」，唱了一陣，我一聲不響的跟着他，快走到村邊了，他忽的扭轉過臉麥問：</p>
<p>「巡長，你今天運氣怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「輸了三塊多錢。」</p>
<p>兩個人又沉默下來，我明白他今天很高與，進實局沒半點鐘，連押了兩紅便閘住不耍了，挑了老南瓜半塊錢的大烟膏子，足抽了一通，還說夜裏要睡大金外科去。我呢，比摸了尼姑的奶子還倒回寳盒子是四個黑。好，一下子又拐出了三塊錢去，我們這時走出了村子，那兒是一個斜坡，劉胖子一脚沒站穩給滑了下去，爬起來時他已滾成了個泥獅子了，嘟嘟噥噥的罵着走到局子門口，他一句話也沒跟我說，轉過身就要住屋裏去換衣服，我一把拉住他的胳膊，他從台階上跳下來，驚奇的翻着眼珠向我說：</p>
<p>「幹麽」？</p>
<p>「局長呌我幹麼」？，管娶媳還管養兒子！」</p>
<p>我白了他一眼，他睬也沒睬的跑進屋去，我自己盤算了一下，倒霉是倒在這王八羔子手裏了，要不是他找我去，沒凖撈回本來再贏他幾塊，一邊想着走進後院裏來，聽了聽局長屋裏，安靜得很，我拉開外間屋的風門，局長連連咳嗽了兩聲便問：</p>
<p>「誰呀？」</p>
<p>我趕緊答應了一聲，急匆匆的邁了兩步跑進內間屋去。</p>
<p>局長一個人正睡在床上泡子，抬起頭來閃開燈影子看了看我，便說：</p>
<p>「怎麼這時候才回來」？</p>
<p>我沒敢說什麼，紅着臉立在屋門口，過了一會，偷眼看看局長，並沒有要駡我的神氣，心裏就又多少放了下來。他把嘴閉得緊緊的，看了一下茶盃，我趕快提起茶壺來倒了盃茶遞過去，他一口氣吞下喉嚨，才慢慢讓一縷灰色的烟從口裹濾了出來。坐正了身子，他重燃着了一支紙烟後，慢吞吞的吩咐着：</p>
<p>「是，是。」</p>
<p>我便輕年輕脚的溜了出來。</p>
<p>弟兄們正在屋裏吵嚷着前天那件捉姦的案子，我穿過那小月亮門來，剛要嚷他們兩句，突的屋裏有一個弟兄說：</p>
<p>「局長也不又呌巡長幹什麽？」</p>
<p>「吳占奎那小子除了會給局長添屁骨，還會斡好勾當！」</p>
<p>剛説完，大家都哈哈的大笑起來，我氣得真想撲進去打一通，想想，為這來對付，忍着性子立在雨裏淋了会，装將從外面回來的樣子，咳嗽着，拉開門，强打着呵欠邁進屋去。</p>

<p>— 米山</p>
<p>葉綠河每天憤怒地吼呌着，像一隻被追擊着的老虎似的，披着黃色的泥沙交織成的波濤的衣服，從我們莊前往山東境里跑去。</p>
<p>恐怕打有這河他就這樣憤怒。根據貴的神，他管理着普天下的山岳河流。葉綠河自然也要屬於他管的。但是，葉綠河有時候很頑皮，以致惹起神底怒，罰他終生奔跑，直到他乾了的時候。</p>
<p>但是，我們那里有句俗話說的好：「柏樹落了葉，石滾（壓塲用的農具）淌了心，葉綠河晒了岸，天下平平安安」。這就是告訴我們，葉綠河是不會乾的。我們底地方也就永遠得不到平平安安的日子過。</p>
<p>誰也不明白爲什麽，我們底日子會一天天的苦了。祖父常常感傷地搖着頭，捻着鬍鬚說：「在以前誰家也是快樂的。托神底保佑，我們是神底安樂的子民，可是…可是打有了洋人來，……」</p>
<p>在我底記憶里，就沒有過快樂。</p>
<p>我們住在有二十九家人的村落里，靠近河岸，向四外看去是閃着金星的沙漠，我們底屋子矮矮地築在河岸邊的沙</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>上。全家六七口人住在一起。</p>
<p>早晨起來，把捉魚的網晒一晒，就準備一天的工作了。那工作是非常的艱辛的，常常忙一天，得不到什麽。雖然我們底肩背已經像散了一樣地累了。</p>
<p>年老的人都告訴我們：在以前從來沒有過這樣的苦生活。那時他們駕着船到各處去，有時就走不多遠，已經可以捉到很多的魚回來了。又因爲葉綠河的鯉魚是很有名的，魚行里就很快地把魚收去，我們就把換來的錢換成用的東西，冬天的時候，就在屋里避冬，或者出去找枯樹呀什麽地來做燃料。有時誰犯了神底怒，船翻了身，死去了，那也是很少的事情。甚至沒有這回事。</p>
<p>後來，葉綠河像發了在一樣，動不動就漲水，平常也像瘋在的狗一樣地吼呌着，大的浪頭打過來的時候，我們簡直是沒有法想，祈禱那漸漸沒有靈燄的神，也是無用了。</p>
<p>這還沒有什麽。因爲我們底生活把我們養成了一條硬漢，把生命看作沒有什麽關係的事情。——死就死吧，二十年後又有一條强健的小夥子了。最使我們沒有辦法只有憤怒的是那些洋人底洋船。他們簡直不用動手，祇聽見卟啦卟啦的聲音，魚就進到他們底網里了。他們穿得好，吃得好，就是我們苦了：我們簡直不能再生活下去。</p>
<p>每次，我跟大哥去打魚，都是失望地回來。</p>
<p>比我們更慘的還有，——他們給洋船撞翻了。</p>
<h3 id="c236">我底旅伴 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>——漂泊散記之二——</p>
<p>踏着朦朧的星夜，循着用蛋石砌成的棧道，一級一級地爬將下來，回頭向上看時，那庵頂的七寳塔已經在薄暗中糢糊了，大家停　步，便在路旁的岩石上隨便歇下，江西人，那個在旅店上碰到的旅伴，已在肩上褪下包袱，坐在石級上，沉默着。嘴里啣着的小菸袋，輕輕地跳躍着一縷縷的火星，很快地在黑暗中一劃便消隱了。</p>
<p>一百五十里山道的行旅，在一個運貨伕是算不了一回事的；可是從昨晚找不到歇脚地連夜兼程的趕着時，他却變得像病馬一般的絕望，凄凉地嘆息着，一會又暴怒的咒駡起來——</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」他悲憤地吼道「我們要跑了這樣可詛咒的山路，而入家却安穩地坐在行里敲他們底算盤，計算着數不淸的入益？……」我沒有去理睬他，等一等他又絕望地喃着，好像替自己解答也似的「爲的，這是生活啊！」</p>
<p>山地靜悄悄的，四周儘是黑夜，夜鳥的尖啼從林的那邊幽幽地透了過來，很快地又迥蕩着飛揚開去。江西人忽然從沉靜中抬起他深湛的眼睛，把小菸袋里的烟燼，向石級上磕出來，向身上藏好，駃起包袱，站立起來，悄悄的說道：「走吧！」於是我們又一級一級的沿着山坡拐下。這回他好像興奮得多了，小早菸的功效在這兒是明顯的。他已忘掉了嘆息，也忘掉了疲勞了。</p>
<p>這兒的棧道對於大家是熟稔的，特別是江西人。他告訴過我，二十年來的時光都是在這兒消磨的。「好伙計。」他說「像這樣的路我就是閉起眼來走，也不會有什麼差錯的，不過……」</p>
<p>他深深地爲回憶所苦了。於是開始用感傷的聲調，叙述他幸福的過去。那時他還年靑，有一個賢良而美麗的妻子，當他們結婚不久，便像其他村里人一樣地伴隨着出來趕山道。「那時的日子在我們常是感不到疲勞的，當大家感受着飢餓的威脅時，便停歇在路旁的樹蔭下，我從包袱里拿出乾糧，而她則像一隻敏健的猿猴爬上嶺峯去，滿盛着溪泉回來。於是我們便蓆地坐着，咀嚼起乾糧，而且喝起氷凉的溪泉。……小伙計，我想你是不相信的，她是這麽地美麗，美麗得像一個幸福的后妃。……</p>
<p>「這樣夢般的生活着，我們過了三個春天。像一個肥皂泡般的破毀了。這個世界遺留下給我的便只有這樣的一個空虛，一個可怕的謊。……</p>
<p>「就在陳旅進剿虎溪岩的那一年，我們剛想從內山回來，在嶺峯便被他們一隊便衣隊截獲了，說是奸細，剝去了我們底衣服，細膩的檢查着每一個毛孔和衣角。當我掉頭看着我底妻時，她也正受了和我一樣的侮辱和刑罰，她那美麗的星眼在流着淚，給兩手深深的掩住，讓那健康而豐滿的肢體在溫煦的陽光下裸露着。有一個粗黑的大漢，便露着滿口黃牙，貪婪的向她獰笑着，還伸出他那粗硬的雙手在她底乳峯上捉弄地撫摸着，她底全身因此便觸電也似的戰慄起來，終於哇的哭了。朋友，你該想像得出，那時我底心該是多麽的傷痛！我恨不得揚起我底拳，跑過去給這些無恥的强盜們一陣拼死的毆打：然而，我不能够，我底兩手被他們捉住。於是我只有哀聲的呼號着，流着淚。</p>
<p>「事情很快地便結束了，我們赤裸着身被帶去見他們底長官，事實證明着我們不是匪探便被放了出來。然而，幸福再也不向我們降臨了，我底美麗的妻憂慮着，悲傷着，她是這麼傷痛地在流着僧恨的眼淚。就在被放出的當天，在無知無覺當中，她底生命在嶺峯上消失了。她是從山尖跳下自殺的。……朋友，這樣的生活我能不能憂傷？我已失去了幸福，也失去了溫柔，我便是這麼寂寞的一個人，我蒼老了。……」</p>
<p>江西人啞聲地嘶喊着，他底喉嚨被梗住，嗚咽着哭了。</p>
<h3 id="c237">娜拉（十四） <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 萬超塵作圖忻忻說明</p>
<p>郝爾茂回來了，娜拉又重申早晨的前議請求他保存柯樂克的位置，卽使柯樂克的位置已給了林敦夫人，也請他開除別一個職員。</p>
<p>郝爾茂聽了非常震怒，他說：我沒有弱點給人家攻擊；現在辭退柯樂克的消息已經傳遍行裏了，如果傳到外邊去，說這個新總理被他妻子在指頭上弄來弄去——他又說明苦衷：柯樂克品行上的缺點或許可以不計較，但是柯樂克直喊他的名字却將使他有傷尊嚴。在惱怒下，他呌愛蘭把辭退柯樂克的信送了出去。</p>
<p>最後，他說：「什麽都不怕，到了緊急關頭，我自有膽力去對付，我的兩隻闊肩膀足以挑得起那付重担」。</p>
<p>他要慰了娜拉一下，回到書房裏去了。</p>
<p>娜拉像嚇呆了的鷄子一樣。</p>

<p>羅克四年的心血結晶</p>
<p>本年度派拉蒙公司名貴出品，著名笑匠羅克主演的最新滑稽鉅片「無膽英雄」The　Milky　Way，已定於今日（星期三）起，在大光明公映。這位銀幕上的漂亮滑精大王，久巳未有新片問世，賣座之盛，當可預卜。據他對人說，他一生拍戲，除却這部「無膽英雄」外，很少採用劇本，他一天閒着無事，就想滑糟材料，此外尚有許多影迷給他的信，也時常供給他的笑料。他一有了新鮮的笑料，就馬上把他採取下來，攝入鏡頭，所以他的影片，笑料總要比別人的滑稽片多，他確是一個製造笑料的專家，全世界影迷的所以歡迎他，也就是因爲這個原故。在「無膽英雄」裏，不但有極好的劇本，更有羅克自製的不少極好笑料，因此比他本人以前的作品更爲精彩，滬上人士，如果需要解悶和痛笑的話，這却是一個不可錯過的最好機會，結果一定能够使你滿意的。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>最近有人忠告我當心電影消息無病而「息」，也有人冒了××影片公司打電話到本報廣告部，（這是天一公司高天棲先生的老手法，拆穿了是不値一文錢的，而况還是冒名的呢！）蒙他們這樣注意到我這位「消息編輯」是値得感謝的。</p>
<p>前天遇見一位姓林的朋友，在漸漸地談到電影消息的時候，就談到以上的「問題」了，據說原因是爲了「銀色雜筆」而起，那末，我旣是「消息」的「編輯」，似乎也應該說幾句話之必要了。</p>
<p>我想本報的讀者大概可以爲我證明吧，最初的銀色雜筆是祗「雜」些消息報導之類的東西，不過也偶或禍及電影界的不良現象，於是雜筆就闖了禍，好像你爲什麼不安穩地做做「消息編輯」，而偏要「開口」起來呢？那時候的情形是瞞木了讀者的，在「黑暗里」　了冷拳而要「禁止」人家「開口」，似乎顯得太「覇道」一點，</p>
<p>有一天在新雅遇見黑嬰，他告訴我那篇用「伐揚」筆名的東西不是他寫的；姓林的朋友也告訴我「哲人」有時也並不一定是穆時英的筆名，那末，這惰形是極容易明白的，我也不想多說些什麼了。</p>
<p>關於「春之花」，同事黃君曾接到某導演的電話，他要我做一些「什麼」，而我是「什麽」也沒有做到，那冒名電話或許就因此而來的吧，這史是使我有話也無從說起了。</p>
<p>總之，這年頭不是個「太平世界」，記得史東山想在「長恨歌」中多配兩聲狗叫，實在是對的！</p>

<p>Communist Bandits in Southern Hebei's Yaoshan and Other Counties Have Been Suppressed</p>
<p>Taiyuan: The bandits entrenched in Lingshi Zhuichi Town were extremely powerful. After continuous attacks by our army, according to today's report, the area was recovered this afternoon. A few hundred bandits fleeing from the Wenshui Jiaocheng area to the Hekou Town, tens of miles west of the provincial capital, were surrounded and attacked by the local defense corps. In the afternoon, they fled to Ximing Village. Officials dispatched teams to attack, and they should be eliminated soon. Our army has mostly routed the bandits in Zhongyang and Shilou. Currently, to prevent the bandits from continuing to cross the river from Shaanxi, Yan specially telegraphed military police in riverside counties, offering rewards for burning bandit ships.

More than a hundred of them split off, planning to harass Hekou Town. They were severely attacked by the Yangqu Anti-Communist Defense Corps, and the bandits immediately fled back to Gujiao Town. The bandits are currently being tracked and pursued by the bandit suppression troops. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

The result came at dusk. This battle was the fiercest since the suppression of the communists. The number of bandits was as high as 7,000 to 8,000.

Corpses are scattered everywhere and are currently being cleared. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>National Assembly: Distribution of Delegate Quotas; Divided into Three Categories: Regional, Professional, and Special; 24-Member Committee Meets for Discussion</p>
<p>Nanjing: The two drafts of the National Assembly Organization Law and the Delegate Election Law have been drafted by Lin Bin and others and sent to Sun Ke, the convener of the 24-member committee, after整理 and reviewing the articles and text. Sun specially summoned Fu Lin and others on the 23rd to listen to the drafting report and gave instructions. Chuan has scheduled a meeting of all members of the 24-member committee on the 27th for discussion. According to Chuan's statement to reporters on the 24th, the total number of delegates to the National Assembly has been determined to be 1,200. Among these 1,200 people, after deducting the number of delegates to be elected by special elections for overseas Chinese, border areas, and the military, the remaining number will be allocated to professional elections and regional elections in a ratio of 35% to 65%. The number of delegates to be elected from the regional area accounts for a larger number, followed by professional, and then special. Those involved in this decision believe that the distribution of delegate quotas is fair after careful research. However, the Overseas Chinese, Mongolian-Tibetan, and Military Commissions have submitted written opinions to the Council on the allocation of delegate quotas for overseas Chinese, border areas, and the military. To ensure that the legislation is thorough, they plan to submit the delegate quota allocation table and the opinions of the Overseas Chinese and other commissions to the Central Standing Committee for final approval after the initial review and discussion of the two cases this week. According to reporters' inquiries, the minimum number of delegates from each province and city is ten, and the maximum is forty-five. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The initial draft of the National Assembly Organization Law has been completed. Regarding the election law, the statutory number of people has been set at 1,200. The method of distribution is to remove the special elections for the military, Mongolian-Tibetan, and overseas Chinese from the total number. The remaining 35% will be allocated to professional elections, and 65% will be allocated to regional elections. The Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Chinese Commissions have sent their opinions to the Legislative Yuan's drafting committee, and it is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 27th to discuss them.

He originally intended to go to Ping, but he abandoned the idea due to the short time. He will stay in Changchun for one day and return to Tokyo via Korea. He will not stop in Korea. He exchanged views with Foreign Minister Zhang in Beijing, but the specific measures were not discussed. Each exchanged opinions from a free standpoint. He visited Chiang Kai-shek twice, but it was not a formal meeting, only discussing preparatory matters. Sino-Japanese relations are beneficial to both sides, so he came to China with the intention of adjusting the relations. Visiting Chiang and Zhang was the best opportunity. He cannot express optimism or pessimism about the relations between the two countries. Both sides must continue to work hard, which cannot be achieved in a short time. If the result of the efforts is good, he will be optimistic; if not, he will be pessimistic. He wanted to come to China again, but if he is appointed as foreign minister, he will not be able to come again. Regarding the diplomatic policy towards Russia, he cannot say because he has not yet assumed the responsibility of foreign minister. But Japan has no intention of fighting with Russia. There is currently no reason for conflict between the two sides, but we must guard against the communists. The meetings of Japanese consuls in Shanghai and Tianjin were only for listening to reports.

<h3 id="e13">Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Talks About Important Financial Issues; The Organizational Law of the Central Bank Is Under Review by the Central Political Committee; The Elimination of Smuggling in North China Is Being Discussed by Three Ministries; The Nationalization of Gold Is a Rumor Created by Speculators <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance made a statement to the Central News Agency reporters on the morning of the 24th regarding the current important financial issues, as follows: The amended draft of the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Finance passed by the Legislative Yuan is currently being studied in detail in order to be reorganized accordingly. The amendment will reform the current customs system. Whether it will affect tax revenue will also be concluded after research. It is difficult to determine when the reorganization will begin. The amended draft of the Central Bank Organizational Law has been resolved by the Executive Yuan and submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The amount is still under review by the special committee of the Central Political Committee. Because the reorganization of the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank is a fundamental institution for building the national financial structure, opinions from well-known banking experts at home and abroad must be sought to improve the amendment. The establishment of a real estate mortgage loan bank is being actively prepared by the China Construction Bank under orders and has indeed shown signs. Because the issue of real estate mortgage loans has a considerable relationship with foreign banks in China, Song Zi'ang is exchanging views with the foreign banking community in China. The elimination of smuggling in North China is currently being carried out by the central government and local governments separately. The measures agreed upon by the Tianjin Customs and the Railway Bureau can only treat the symptoms. The fundamental solution is being discussed by the three ministries of foreign affairs, railways, and finance designated by the Executive Yuan. The saying that gold is nationalized is indeed a rumor created by speculators in the Shanghai public market. Anyone with a little financial knowledge and familiarity with China's financial and economic situation will not believe it. Many unrealistic rumors are fabricated by speculators in various financial markets. No country in the world can escape this bad example. If the government wants to correct them one by one, it will be truly overwhelmed. (24th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance said, 1. The nationalization of gold is completely untrue. 2. Changes in salt affairs are being studied to see if they will affect the tax revenue of the national treasury. The implementation date is hoped to be at the beginning of the 25th year. 3. The Organizational Law of the Central Reserve Bank is under review. 4. The elimination of smuggling in North China continues to be discussed. 5. The real estate mortgage bank is being prepared by Song Zi'ang, the manager of the Construction Bank, and is roughly in order. He is currently in contact with foreign banks in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e16">New Changes in the Shanghai Speculative Market <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>In October of last year, the Shanghai gold standard, public bonds, raw cotton, flour, and various grain exchanges all experienced a period of vigorous activity due to rumors of currency reform. Subsequently, with the implementation of monetary policy and the stabilization of foreign exchange, the gold standard was the first to be affected. Prices often fluctuated around 1,150 yuan, no longer experiencing significant gains or losses. The gold industry market, known for its prosperity, suddenly appeared deserted. Other markets also gradually stabilized. When the national debt unification and redemption plan was implemented, the securities market, which had occupied the leading position, also experienced an unprecedented decline. The daily transaction volume sharply decreased from several tens of millions of yuan to one or two million yuan, the lowest record in the exchange's history. Looking back on the past, one cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude. The reason for this is not only the national debt unification and redemption. Indeed, as the Far East situation became increasingly tense and the European situation was stimulated by the German army's entry into the Rhineland, it was as if a major war was about to begin. Speculators then became enthusiastic about commodities such as raw cotton, flour, and grains, and the public bond market became increasingly sluggish and unable to recover.</p>
<p>Recently, commodity speculation has replaced the former position of gold and public bonds, becoming the lifeline of speculators. The prosperous atmosphere of various commodity exchanges contrasts sharply with the desolate scene of the gold and securities markets. However, commodity speculation is actually far more risky than securities. Taking public bonds as an example, in the absence of major political changes, there are both interest income and the opportunity to redeem the principal upon winning a lottery. Conversely, the issue of commodity purchases by bulls is more complex. Stockpiling spot goods not only does not have a fixed interest income, but also requires subsidies for interest, warehouse rent, insurance, and losses due to inventory damage. Taking cotton as an example, the minimum loss per bale per month is 50 cents in national currency. If stockpiled for half a year, the loss per dan (approximately 50 kg) would reach 3 yuan in national currency. Compared to marketable securities, the difference between buying and selling is significant. Furthermore, major commodities such as cotton and wheat are international commodities, and their prices also fluctuate based on international supply and demand. If domestic prices are slightly lower, foreign merchants will take the opportunity to purchase them, and if prices rise too sharply, foreign goods will be dumped in succession. Therefore, the commodity market is often regulated by the international market to maintain its balance, preventing it from being as erratic as marketable securities. Even manufactured goods such as cotton yarn and flour are subject to fluctuations based on their related raw materials. If prices are drastically raised, causing the ratio between finished products and raw materials to become too large, manufacturers, tempted by the high profits, will inevitably sell in large quantities, regardless of demand, and do their best to rush production, resulting in the danger of overproduction.</p>
<p>Overall, commodity speculation is not as simple and easy to understand as public bonds, and speculators mostly blindly follow suit, hoping to make a profit. Those who have a considerable understanding of a certain commodity and know a little about its international production and sales situation are rare. Even brokers rely solely on years of experience as the basis for their business. Those with technical skills who have received scientific training are extremely rare. Therefore, the future of commodity speculation is also difficult to be optimistic about. The recent surge in raw cotton, flour, and wheat, followed by a sudden drop, has already taught a lesson to blind bulls.</p>

<p>London. British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the Foreign Office had received a report from Mr. Teichman, Counselor of the British Embassy in China, regarding his experiences traveling from North China to Xinjiang. After Mr. Teichman arrives in England, it will be carefully considered, and whether it should be published will depend on the outcome of the consideration. The report was originally sent from Delhi. Mr. Teichman departed from Beijing, passed through Hami, Dihua, and Kashgar, and arrived there at the end of January. It is believed that the report chronicles the recent developments in Xinjiang and pays attention to the expansion of Soviet influence, which greatly hinders British trade with India, and requests the Foreign Office to pay attention to the discriminatory measures taken by the province against Indian merchants applying for entry permits.

<p>Tokyo. Foreign Minister Hirota instructed Ambassador Ota to Russia on the 24th to continue negotiations with the Soviet government on the Manchurian-Mongolian and Manchurian-Russian issues. The main points of the instruction are as follows: The Manchurian-Russian border demarcation committee should limit itself to the eastern Manchurian-Russian border (i.e., between Xingkai Lake and Tumen River) and make concessions in exchange for this condition, and also establish a border dispute handling committee. Regarding the Manchurian-Mongolian border issue, the principle is that Japan and Russia will not participate. "Manchukuo" has decided to make concessions on the issue of exchanging representatives between the two countries, so as to satisfy the determination of the border and the exchange of representatives. (Domei Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>Paris. Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, recently stated in an interview with a correspondent from The Times in Moscow, "The political talks recently held between Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov and Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Ota have been progressing smoothly, which is a prelude to the rapprochement between Japan and Russia." Referring to the dispatch of troops by Germany into the Rhineland region, he said that although the danger felt by Western European countries is more pressing, the Eastern European countries are also threatened. "As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, if France is attacked by European countries, regardless of Poland's attitude, the Soviet Union will faithfully abide by the obligations of the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact." The Soviet Union has abandoned the imperialist policies of the Tsarist era, so the relationship between Russia and Poland will soon improve. Molotov then advocated that Russia, Germany, and France should be close to each other. He said that in some respects, the Soviet Union is still unwilling to compromise with the German authorities. Since the leaders of the country recently made remarks and violently attacked the Soviet Union, this sentiment is undoubtedly excited. However, people here generally believe that it is still possible to improve relations between Russia and Germany, and the Soviet government also believes so. The way to improve relations between Russia and Germany is that the United Kingdom should be good at making Germany return to the League of Nations, and take Germany's proof of a desire to respect international treaties and faithfully abide by treaty obligations as a condition. If Germany can prove that it has a peaceful mentality and can respect international treaties and the League of Nations covenant, then France and Germany can also be close to each other, which will be of great help to guaranteeing peace. Molotov finally stated that the Soviet constitutional system will be reformed, for example, the establishment of legislative assemblies in the Soviet republics and a federal general legislative assembly, all of which are elected by universal direct suffrage and secret ballot. Except for those who have committed criminal cases and are sentenced by the court, all citizens have the right to vote and elect. (Havas Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Pitman. Re-discussing Japan's Ambitions, the United States Should Expand Its Military to Maintain Peace</p>
<p>Washington. Pitman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the United States, who recently launched a major attack on Japan, today again severely criticized Japan, pointing out that it is again trying to expand its aggression. He said that Japan is deliberately destroying the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations covenant, without any scruples, and its aggressive actions and its contempt for treaty obligations have not been interfered with or sanctioned in the slightest except for the protests of the United States and the non-recognition of the League of Nations. This situation is enough to fuel Japan's arrogance and ambition. Therefore, Pitman believes that if we want to maintain peace in the future, we can only greatly expand our military preparations, because today's air force and high-speed warships are progressing, and we cannot maintain control of the sea without this.

<p>Clydebank. The world's largest merchant ship, the Queen Mary, slowly sailed out of the shipyard of John Brown &amp; Company this morning at 10:10 am, towed by seven tugboats. After 15 minutes, it entered the river and then sailed along the river by its own power. Four tugboats followed it into the sea and went to Southampton. Many people watched along the river and cheered loudly. (Reuter Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>London. The new ship "Queen Mary" of White Star Line, totaling 87,730 tons, is more than 1,200 tons larger than the French Normandy, but this new ship is 1,018 feet long, 56 feet longer than the French ship. Today, this new ship will enter the sea and go to Southampton for its first voyage, so it is expected that many people will go to Clydebank today to watch it sail. At that time, eight tugboats will tow it into the sea, and four will follow it. The new ship is scheduled to go to New York from Southampton on May 27 for its maiden voyage. It is expected that it can prove that it is the fastest merchant ship in the world, with a speed of 30 nautical miles per hour, which is equal to 34.5 miles on land. According to reports, the French ship Normandy traveled from Southampton to New York across the Atlantic Ocean last June in four days, three hours, and five minutes, with an average speed of 29.98 nautical miles. Although the average speed of the Queen Mary's normal navigation is set at 29 nautical miles, it can reach an average speed of 34 nautical miles on its maiden voyage. However, this is not the highest speed of the new ship. The ship has 27 steam boilers and 16 turbines. If all are started, the speed of the ship can be more than 40 nautical miles per hour. The ship will have two captains, who will be jointly responsible. This is a pioneering move in the shipping industry. This ship was designed by the best scientific minds in the UK, and it was built by skilled workers. 300,000 people, directly and indirectly, worked on this ship. (Reuter Telegram on the 24th)</p>

<p>"The nature of Chinese farmers is docile," I didn't say that wrong. However, we cannot deny that "you can't squeeze oil from sugar cane dregs." When the amount demanded by unscrupulous tax collectors exceeds their—the farmers'—ability to bear it, even the most "docile" farmers will rise up and fight like cornered beasts!</p>
<p>Here, let us unfold an unfinished tragic story:</p>
<p>One cold, windy, and bleak night, driven by my duties, I went to a public school about four li away from my residence to see them attending night classes. After class, many familiar but not entirely known farmers surrounded me to talk. Among this sincere group, I noticed a middle-aged farmer named Junquan, which made me think of his wife—Yu Que's—who was currently detained in the county government facing charges. I had heard about this a month ago, but I had forgotten about it after hearing it at the time. Now that I met him in person, I wanted to ask him for details.</p>
<p>"Ah, Junquan! Has your wife been released?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, no!" was a bitter and heavy reply.</p>
<p>"It's been sixty-two days today!" Someone behind me added resentfully.</p>
<p>"Oh, so do you actually owe land tax?"</p>
<p>"I don't owe! Not only do I not owe, but they used to overcharge me four or five yuan every year. It was even worse the year before last, they overcharged me nine yuan. I haven't even received the second installment of the receipt, and he said that the rice I gave him was not good."</p>
<p>"Since you don't owe and they're still extorting you, why did they arrest your wife?"</p>
<p>"It's everyone who harmed him!" Twenty or thirty voices spoke almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Because we have been extorted by the tax collector every year and really can't afford it, some people initiated the idea of going to the granary ourselves to pay this year. Who knew the news would leak out, and he—referring to the tax collector—took action first!"</p>
<p>A young farmer explained to me enthusiastically. Everyone's facial expressions were very tense.</p>
<p>"Also, this year the tax collector withheld the receipt. I went to the county myself to pay. The granary said that I couldn't pay without the receipt. Later, I hardened my heart and argued with them. I said, 'If you don't let me pay, I'll go to the provincial government to sue!' They had no choice but to call an old gentleman to persuade me and help me check the amount of land tax, and as a result, I paid eleven yuan and twenty cents. Therefore, the tax collector hated me even more!" This was Junquan's words.</p>
<p>"Was there a court hearing?"</p>
<p>"No! The petition to request a court hearing has been submitted five times!"</p>
<p>"Five petitions have gone to the City God Temple!"</p>
<p>Everyone smiled unnaturally and was immediately surrounded by a solemn atmosphere again.</p>
<p>I was astonished! The county government detained a farm woman for more than sixty days for no reason, without questioning or releasing her. What kind of logic is this?</p>
<p>After the solar new year, I ran into a farmer from the aforementioned village alley on the road. According to him, Junquan's wife was detained for sixty-six days before he was summoned for questioning, and the questions were completely irrelevant. At this time, his wife was sick, and Junquan went to replace her. Now it has been more than twenty days! I don't know when this lawsuit will end and when he will be released from prison?</p>
<p>Tonight is the twenty-sixth day of the lunar December (the couple has been detained for a total of ninety-four days). The sharp west wind intermittently brings the barking of cold dogs. The clock ticks in the freezing air, which makes me think of Junquan, who is suffering in prison right now. I'm afraid he won't be able to go home for the "New Year's Eve dinner" this year, will he?</p>
<p>Five. Conclusion</p>
<p>The aforementioned various facts are enough to illustrate the ruthlessness of the tax collectors' methods of harassing the people and the miserable situation of those who are exploited and left to be slaughtered. In the past, I have repeatedly seen reports about the exorbitant taxes and levies in provinces such as Sichuan, and at that time, I thought that this was only a unique phenomenon under the situation of warlord separatism. Now I know that "crows are black all over the world."</p>

<p>Rome. Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed a tripartite agreement today to extend the validity of the 1934 tripartite agreement, consolidate the political and economic relations of the three countries, and assist each other publicly, similar in nature, but with more ambiguous wording. (23rd, Guomin Electric)</p>
<p>Rome. It is now believed that one of the clauses of the agreement signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary today is that if the League of Nations implements sanctions against Germany, the three countries will not participate. It is heard that the statement also declares the determination to maintain Austria's independence and invites other countries to join the agreement, apparently intending to make Austria and Czechoslovakia cooperate more closely. The three countries also agree to increase commercial relations with each other in economic terms. The agreement will be announced today. (24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome. It was officially announced that Prime Minister Mussolini met with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös at the Palazzo Venezia this afternoon to sign a protocol as an annex to the tripartite agreement of March 17, 1934 between Italy, Austria, and Hungary. The full text will be announced tomorrow afternoon. The final communiqué on the course of the talks stated that "the authorities of the three countries are sincere and can understand each other." As far as the general public knows, the authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary have already agreed to adopt a common stance on foreign policy and have agreed that the Danube countries may join the 1934 tripartite agreement under certain conditions, but Italy is unwilling to establish an agreement with countries participating in sanctions while the sanction measures continue to be implemented. In the future, any agreement shall recognize the principle of equal rights and be concluded within the scope of the League of Nations. (23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome. After the authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed the protocol yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Guido Schmidt for an hour at 12:00 noon today. It is expected that a communiqué will still be issued this afternoon with some explanations. According to sources in political circles, although the authorities of the three countries have decided that the countries in the Danube River basin may join the 1934 tripartite agreement under certain conditions, the protocol signed yesterday was only signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary. According to well-informed sources, during the talks, the authorities of the three countries also occasionally mentioned the issue of rearming Austria and Hungary. Most members of the Austrian and Hungarian delegations are scheduled to return to their countries this evening, but the two prime ministers, Schuschnigg and Gömbös, plan to stay here for a few days in a private capacity. Pope Pius XI is scheduled to receive Gömbös this evening. (24th, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome. After signing the protocol yesterday, the authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary signed another protocol today, stipulating that a standing conference be organized by the foreign ministers of the countries concerned to meet periodically. This conference is actually similar to the standing political conference of the Little Entente countries. (24th, Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>Berlin. The German representative to the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, Ribbentrop, flew to London at 2:08 PM today with the government's reply to the Locarno Four-Power Pact. No one knows what the content of this reply is. Political figures are unwilling to comment on it. However, semi-official sources claim that in addition to carrying a written reply, Ribbentrop intends to provide supplementary oral explanations at the Administrative Council meeting. Foreign affairs figures believe that Germany will reject several measures of the Locarno Four-Power Pact and adopt delaying tactics on several other measures. In short, the German government's reply will only be released after Ribbentrop delivers it to British Foreign Secretary Eden for review. (24th, Havas)</p>
<p>London. France formally notified Britain today, stating that it does not want to make any concessions to the Four-Power Pact and is unwilling to discuss any counter-proposals from Germany in London. This proves that differences have arisen in the positions of Britain and France, making it hopeless to resolve the situation caused by Germany's actions for a while. It is heard that General Ribbentrop, the German representative, will stay in London for several days after returning to London. If there is hope for a compromise after the negotiations, the Locarno powers will continue to meet in Lausanne. The League of Nations is becoming increasingly impatient because the Locarno powers have been unable to reach a compromise with Germany. The Administrative Council meeting this afternoon may decide to announce the postponement of the Administrative Council meeting and reconvene as usual in May. (24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London. The League of Nations Administrative Council was originally scheduled to discuss the Locarno Four-Power Pact at 4:00 PM today. Because the German representative, Ribbentrop, did not arrive from Berlin until 2:00 PM today, it may not be in time. Therefore, the Administrative Council has decided to postpone the meeting. However, the general public believes that the real reason for the postponement of the Administrative Council meeting is that the opinions of the countries concerned differ, causing many difficulties.

<p>Paris. Regarding the Locarno Four-Power Pact, rumors that the government has decided not to discuss any counter-proposals that Germany may put forward have been confirmed by responsible persons, who said that Premier Sarraut and Foreign Minister Flandin have repeatedly stated that France does not want to conduct negotiations under threat and that the international rule of law must be restored. As for the proposal in the German memorandum to submit various suggestions for discussion, France is not determined to reject it, but requires that it be done in an international conference. This is what Foreign Minister Flandin and Minister Without Portfolio Peng Gu agreed with the representatives of Britain, Belgium, and Italy at the Locarno conference in London a few days ago. Although the conditions stipulated in the Locarno Four-Power Pact have been approved by the British Cabinet, they must still be implemented. (24th, Havas)</p>

News from Paris today said that the French government's will is that France will not make any concessions whatsoever to the agreement reached by the Locarno powers, Britain, France, and Italy, in London. Germany must accept it or reject it. The London delegations were greatly shocked by this news. It is also heard that French Foreign Minister Flandin said that he does not want to return to London to discuss Germany's answer. The London delegations now feel that this attitude will endanger the overall situation and make a compromise with Germany practically impossible. Officials have not announced this news, but it has been said that Flandin and Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland will not return to London. Any negotiations on Germany's answer will be conducted through ordinary diplomatic channels. (24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin. News that French Foreign Minister Flandin refused to consider any answers that Germany put forward to the Four-Power Memorandum caused a shock in political circles here, and it was seen that Flandin's attitude contradicted the remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the Lower House yesterday. When the British Foreign Secretary mentioned the Four-Power Memorandum in the House, he said that if the German government believed that it could not accept the conditions of the four powers and put forward an answer, the British government would welcome it. (24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris. France is preparing today to deal with German Head of State Hitler's rejection of the Locarno powers' proposal. Premier Sarraut, Foreign Minister Flandin, and other cabinet members discussed the actions to be taken in the future today. Official sources said that if Britain, Belgium, and Italy do not want to support France's position, France will unilaterally implement economic sanctions against Germany to prevent Germany from obtaining the necessary foreign funds. (23rd, Guomin Electric)</p>
<p>London. When the Lower House met today, Prime Minister Baldwin replied to a question about the European situation, saying that the British government's main goal is to maintain the principle of respecting the treaty. Foreign Secretary Eden replied to another question, saying that when he spoke with German Representative General Ribbentrop, he clearly stated that the content of the official document he sent to Mr. Ribbentrop was of a suggestive nature. He also said, "I have explained that the British government hopes that the German government can accept it. The British government feels that in any event, the German government should assist the British government in its work to improve the situation by making constructive contributions." The British Ambassador stationed in Berlin has been instructed to explain to the German Foreign Minister in the same language. The German government's reply has not yet arrived. (23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>London. Lord Privy Seal Halifax, one of the British representatives who participated in the four-country discussions in Paris and London, said in a speech in Bristol yesterday that we do not want to surround Germany, nor do we want to establish secret treaties, but we want European cooperation that Germany can freely join. The proposal made to Germany by the signatories of the Locarno Pact is not an ultimatum that Germany must accept, but if the German government believes that it cannot accept it in any way, the signatories can of course ask the German government to put forward other equally effective methods to show Germany's true contribution to the resolution of this matter. As far as the British government is concerned, any answer from Germany can be given the most careful consideration. The only wish of the British government and people is to exert all its power to maintain peace in Europe and to create peace based on respect for treaties and mutual understanding. This is the essence of British foreign policy. Speaking of the German reasons stated by German Representative Ribbentrop at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, Mr. Hall said that the German representative's remarks have many aspects that can arouse sympathy, but no matter what sympathy the British have for what he said, the British concept of respecting the law cannot but condemn the act of directly violating the law. He understands and sympathizes with the anxiety and indignation of France and Belgium caused by the German troops entering the Rhineland. If the first crisis can be mitigated, it is due to the patience of France and Belgium and British Foreign Secretary Eden's unremitting efforts to seek good understanding between the two sides. (24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris. British Foreign Secretary Eden made a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon, in which he said, "When I spoke with German Representative to the League of Nations Administrative Council Ribbentrop, I told him that the draft agreement of the Locarno Conference was of a suggestive nature." Responsible persons in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here were concerned that Eden's remarks might lead to misunderstandings and that the draft agreement could be reconsidered by the Locarno signatories. They recently stated that the French government has no intention of reconsidering the draft agreement, because Foreign Minister Flandin had previously stated in the House of Representatives that this case is an entire acceptance or rejection, and the entire case should be accepted or rejected. Therefore, Flandin has no need to go to London before Germany provides a clear reply (referring to acceptance or rejection). Even if Germany puts forward a counter-proposal at this time, he will never go to London to negotiate with Germany. Flandin is currently feeling tired due to his hard work in the past few days, so he is scheduled to go to the countryside tomorrow for a short rest. As far as this agency's diplomatic reporter knows, Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland has also adopted the same attitude as Flandin, that is, if Germany puts forward a counter-proposal, Prime Minister Zeeland will never return to London to discuss it. (23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>London. The Administrative Council was originally scheduled to discuss the Locarno Four-Power Pact this afternoon. Because German Representative Ribbentrop may not arrive in time, the meeting may be postponed. According to this agency's special correspondent, the Italian government's delay in approving this agreement is also one of the reasons for the postponement of the Administrative Council meeting. It is generally believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini wants to use this opportunity as a bargaining chip. The country has clearly demanded the withdrawal of sanctions as an exchange condition for restoring the Stresa Front of Britain, France, and Italy. Observers claim that Italy has never automatically participated in measures to take coercive measures against Germany and send international troops to occupy the Rhineland region, because Germany did not comply with the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy last year, so Italy wants to use this opportunity to repay it. (24th, Havas)</p>
<p>London. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov criticized the draft agreement proposed by the Locarno Conference, saying that "Italy has not yet formally participated, so this draft agreement is only of a temporary nature." Massigli, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the French Foreign Ministry, visited Italian Ambassador Grandi this afternoon on behalf of the French Minister Without Portfolio, Peng Gu, asking the Italian government to submit a reply to the draft agreement as soon as possible, so that Litvinov would not have any more objections.

<p>London. This question has just received a telegram from the capital of the Netherlands. Well-informed sources in the country have received reliable information from Germany, claiming that the number of members of the German forced labor corps stationed in the Rhineland area has been expanded, and field fortifications have begun to be built in the area. All reserve officers have been summoned back to active duty. (24th, Havas)</p>
<p>Strasbourg, France. Two German military aircraft flew over the suburbs of this city at 11:00 AM today, less than fifty meters above the ground. The purpose was to take photos of the fortress area. Local authorities have copied down the numbers of the aircraft. At 5:20 PM, another German monoplane flew from Billmazen and flew over the town of Wendorf, destination unknown. (23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>Strasbourg, France. An American named Wilde, who is an oil agent, has purchased an aircraft made in the UK. He is suspected of illegally flying over the fortress area. The aircraft he was riding in has been detained by the secret police at the nearby Thiers airfield. (23rd, Havas)</p>

<p>London. Foreign exchange is currently affected by political instability, but the US dollar is particularly strong. The franc is the most vulnerable to attacks in comparison, due to the continued flight of French funds. The British Exchange Equalization Fund is absorbing francs at any time, which is why the pound is weaker than the US dollar. It is said that most of France's liquid funds have been transferred to the United States to seek safety, so the amount of funds escaping from France at present may not be much. However, at least part of the funds newly raised by the French Ministry of Finance will go abroad. The franc's forward discount decreased slightly today to 2.19, but the difference between the forward and spot discounts is still large, because the annual interest rate of selling spot and buying forward is 11.5%. The franc's three-month interest rate rebounded slightly today, due to the settlement of the short side, but not because France will still adhere to the gold standard and improve. (24th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin. Regarding the dispute between Germany and the other signatories of the Locarno Pact, business figures here recently stated that Economics Minister Schacht is now strongly urging Head of State Hitler to make some kind of statement to facilitate the resolution of the situation. Schacht also stated to Hitler that the current diplomatic difficulties must be resolved before Easter, so that German foreign trade, which has been severely hit by the tense European situation, can return to its original state. Economists believe that Germany's existing raw materials are only sufficient for use until mid-April. If the domestic economic situation is not improved in the shortest possible time, various foods may have to be restricted again. (24th, Havas)</p>

<p>Berlin. The election of the House of Representatives is scheduled for March 29. The government has scheduled large-scale prestige movements for the 27th and 28th. The detailed plan has been explained by Propaganda Minister Goebbels in a letter to the people, which states: "At 4:00 PM on the 27th of this month, Head of State Hitler will deliver a radio address to workers and soldiers across the country at the Krupp Armaments Factory in Essen. Prior to this, the national radio station will send a flag-raising signal at 3:45 PM. When the signal is heard, all public institutions and private residences across the country must uniformly hang the national flag. At 4:00 PM, all factories, railway locomotives, and transport ships across the country shall sound their horns at the same time, and all traffic across the country, except for trains and aircraft, must stop for one minute." This one minute of silence is intended to make the people across the country reflect on the national obligations they should fulfill and to show the world that the German people have decided to support Head of State Hitler's policies, which are to guarantee peace, restore honor, and obtain equal rights. March 28, Saturday, is "National Honor, Freedom, and Peace Day." The country has decided to hold celebrations, and various organizations of the National Socialist Party will engage in propaganda activities to arouse the public. At 6:30 PM on the same day, Head of State Hitler will deliver his final election speech. At that time, the people of all cities and towns across the country should gather in the streets and in front of the radio to respectfully listen to the Head of State's speech. (24th, Havas)</p>

<p>London: Madariaga, Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations Council, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, have forwarded the resolution passed by the committee this morning to the Italian Ambassador Grandi. According to Italian sources here, what Madariaga submitted was merely a resolution without any plan to serve as a basis for negotiation. Therefore, the meeting between the two was merely a formality. Furthermore, it is still unknown whether the future peace talks will take place in Rome or London and be presided over by Grandi. Madariaga and Avenol are also scheduled to meet with the Abyssinian representative to France, Minister Gedaword, at noon tomorrow to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian peace issue. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The Abyssinian Minister to France and representative to the League of Nations, Gedaword, called on Madariaga, Chairman of the Committee of Thirteen of the Administrative Council and Spanish representative, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol at noon today. According to Abyssinian sources here, Gedaword's meeting with Madariaga and Avenol was very brief and did not result in any concrete peace plan. Since the Italian army is still stationed within Abyssinian territory and the Abyssinian army continues to resist, peace negotiations are practically impossible. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to news from the Abyssinian capital, the Abyssinian government has instructed its Minister to France, Gedaword, to inquire about the French government's attitude towards the Italo-Abyssinian peace issue. Regarding this matter, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the Abyssinian government has not yet contacted the French government. Abyssinian sources say that Minister Gedaword is currently in London attending the meeting of the Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations Council and will contact the French government after returning to his post. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson also stated that the Committee of Thirteen has entrusted Chairman Madariaga and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to conduct consultations with Italy and Abyssinia.

<h3 id="e82">Youth and Society (Part 2) <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Professor Sun Benwen, Faculty of Arts, Central University</p>
<p>2. The Responsibility of Youth to Society: Since the position of youth in society is so important, the responsibilities they bear are also very significant. Simply put, the responsibilities of youth to society can be divided into two major aspects: namely, the responsibility to promote the past of society and the responsibility to build the future of society.</p>
<p>First, the responsibility to promote the past of society: Chinese society has left behind many legacies in the past that are worthy of our praise. Three examples can be cited:</p>
<p>China has a long history. The length of Chinese history is unmatched by any other country in modern civilized nations. As we know, there were four cultural centers in the ancient world: namely, Egypt, Babylon, China, and India. And now, only China stands proudly independent in the world. Modern European countries, such as England, France, Germany, and Italy, mostly formed after the Tang and Song dynasties in China. The independence and unification of Germany and Italy are even less than a century old. The independence of the United States is only about one hundred and sixty years old. In China's five thousand years, although dynasties have changed, and disturbances have followed one another, and it has been ravaged by foreign races twice, the cultural history has never been interrupted. This is our</p>
<p>China has a unique culture. There must be indelible fundamental reasons why China can have such a long history. According to our analysis, this fundamental reason lies in China's unique culture. This unique culture has enabled the entire Chinese society to form a spiritually consolidated unity and to adapt automatically to the needs of the times. Therefore, although Chinese society has occasionally experienced periods of prosperity and decline in the past, it has never been fundamentally shaken. At least, this was the case before contact with the West. Simply put, this unique culture has three basic patterns: namely, family-based, self-cultivation-based, and moderation-based.</p>
<p>(A) Family-based culture: The family is the unit of Chinese social organization, including paternal relatives, maternal relatives, and marital relatives, that is, both blood relatives and relatives by marriage. Family relations are the paradigm of interpersonal relationships in Chinese society. All relationships in society are concentrated in the family. Then, the family is extended to society and the nation. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Chinese people most worship familism and clanism." He also said: "The Chinese people's solidarity for their families and clans is very strong." The basic spirit that maintains the unity of this family organization is filial piety. All ways of cultivating oneself and governing others are based on filial piety. Therefore, the Classic of Filial Piety says: "Filial piety is the foundation of virtue." It also says: "Filial piety is the law of Heaven, the righteousness of Earth, and the conduct of the people." The Analects also says: "Filial piety and brotherly love are the roots of benevolence." In addition to filial piety, family morality also includes brotherly love, kindness, etc., which is the so-called righteousness of kinship. However, the righteousness of kinship not only extends to the living but also extends to the deceased ancestors, hence the worship of ancestors. As the Doctrine of the Mean says: "Serving the dead as serving the living, serving the departed as serving the existent, is the ultimate filial piety." The Analects also says: "Be cautious in mourning the dead and pursue the memory of the distant ancestors, and the virtue of the people will return to sincerity." Starting from this basic morality of filial piety, it extends beyond the family, and then there is the heart of loyalty and love for the sovereign and the country. The Classic of Filial Piety says: "The gentleman is devoted to filial piety to his parents, so his loyalty can be transferred to the sovereign." It also says: "Serving the sovereign with filial piety is loyalty." The Great Learning says: "Filial piety is the way to serve the sovereign." In short, loyalty is the extension of filial piety. In ancient times, there were monarchs, so loyalty was to the monarch; in modern times, it is loyalty to the country and loyalty to the leader. Further extending to the general society, there is the spirit of regarding all people as siblings and all things as companions. Mencius says: "Love your relatives and be benevolent to the people, be benevolent to the people and love things." He also says: "Treat the young of others as you would your own, and care for the elderly of others as you would your own." The Great Learning says: "Brotherly love is the way to serve elders, and kindness is the way to employ the masses." These are all ways to extend the principle of kinship to society. This process of taking the family as the foundation and extending it to the nation and society is the great way of "managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world." However, in reality, China has always only reached the level of the family. Beyond the family, it has only become an ideal. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The Chinese people's solidarity can only extend to the clan, and has not yet expanded to the nation." To restore the inherent status of the country, we must now, as Mr. Sun said: "Make good use of the inherent groups in China, such as family groups and clan groups, and unite them to form a large national group."</p>
<p>(B) Self-cultivation-based culture: Self-cultivation is the basis of Chinese social ethics and the paradigm of personal cultivation. Family relations are about people-to-people relationships; self-cultivation is about one's relationship with oneself. If everyone in society cultivates themselves, then the family will inevitably be harmonious, and the country will inevitably be well-governed. Therefore, the Great Learning says: "Only when the person is cultivated can the family be regulated; only when the family is regulated can the state be rightly governed." It also says: "From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must regard self-cultivation as the root." According to the eight items set in the Great Learning, namely, investigating things, extending knowledge, making the will sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world. The first five are about one's relationship with oneself, and the last three are about one's relationship with others. Therefore, the self-cultivation-based culture and the family-based culture are originally consistent. However, the self-cultivation-based culture is the foundation of the family-based culture. The steps of self-cultivation are investigating things, extending knowledge, making the will sincere, and rectifying the heart; and the method of self-cultivation is nothing more than overcoming oneself and returning to propriety. Outwardly, one should take rites and righteousness as the norm; inwardly, one should have the effort to overcome oneself. The Book of Rites says: "Rites are what make a person a person." But rites and righteousness must be practiced. Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean says: "There are three hundred rites and three thousand decorums, which must be practiced by the right person." To practice rites and righteousness, one must overcome oneself. The Analects says: "To overcome oneself and return to propriety is benevolence." It also says: "Do not look at what is contrary to propriety, do not listen to what is contrary to propriety, do not speak what is contrary to propriety, do not move in a way that is contrary to propriety." Because overcoming oneself must start from daily life. The rites of seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving, and the etiquette of sweeping and responding are all efforts to overcome oneself. The key points of overcoming oneself lie in caution when alone and reverence for reality. Because of caution when alone, the Great Learning says: "What ten eyes see and ten hands point at, how awe-inspiring it is!" The Book of Poetry says: "Even in your room, do not be ashamed before the roof." Because of reverence for reality, the Doctrine of the Mean says: "Looking inward and finding no guilt, there is no evil in the will." Mencius says: "To reflect on oneself and be sincere is the greatest joy." In this way, by being cautious when alone and revering reality, one overcomes oneself and returns to propriety, thus achieving the goal of self-cultivation. This is the essence of personal cultivation and the paradigm that everyone in society should follow. It is used to teach children, and teachers use it to teach students, and it has not changed much for thousands of years. In reality, not everyone can fully implement it, but it has become a basic culture in society, which is undoubtedly true. However, since the opening of the sea and contact with Western culture, the standards of self-cultivation in this country have changed.</p>
<p>(C) Moderation-based culture: Moderation is the paradigm for managing affairs and conducting oneself in Chinese society. Family and self-cultivation are about one's relationship with others and oneself; moderation is about one's relationship with things. The meaning of moderation is to be impartial, without excess or deficiency. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Moderation is the correct way of the world, and constancy is the principle of the world." Moderation is the correct way and principle; therefore, it contains the meaning of rationality. Rationality is not easy, so the Doctrine of the Mean says: "The wise go too far, and the foolish do not go far enough; the virtuous go too far, and the unworthy do not go far enough." It also says: "Moderation is the highest virtue, but few people can maintain it for long." It also says: "The world and the nation can be governed equally; noble rank and wealth can be declined; white blades can be stepped on; but moderation is impossible." But moderation is not only rational but also must be timely. Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean says: "The gentleman's moderation is that he is timely in his moderation." Timely moderation means being appropriate at all times; it contains the meaning of adapting to the environment. The Analects says: "Speak only when the time is right, and people will not be tired of your words." Mencius says: "Confucius was the sage of timeliness." This "timeliness" means timely moderation, indicating the meaning of adapting to the environment. Since moderation is about adapting to the environment, it has the meaning of evolution. Chinese society was originally evolutionary, and it was the result of the development of moderation culture. Historical books say: "The Three Sovereigns did not follow the music, and the Five Emperors did not follow the rites." Therefore, the Xia dynasty valued loyalty, the Yin dynasty valued simplicity, and the Zhou dynasty valued culture; all were determined according to the needs of adapting to the environment. It can be seen that as times change, society also changes to adapt to them. The Book of Poetry says: "Although Zhou is an old state, its destiny is new." The Great Learning says: "If you can renovate yourself for one day, then do so from day to day, and again from day to day." This means renovating oneself to adapt to the environment; it also contains the meaning of evolution. Moreover, since moderation is neither excessive nor deficient, it has the meaning of harmony. All those who are harmonious must be peaceful. The world recognizes that the Chinese nation is a peaceful nation, which is due to the influence of moderation culture. In short, being able to be harmonious, rational, and adapt to the environment is the way of moderation. The way of moderation is the paradigm for managing affairs and conducting oneself in Chinese society. But in reality, not everyone can follow the way of moderation, but everyone takes it as the standard.</p>
<p>All the three basic cultures mentioned above are unique to China. The family is the paradigm for dealing with people, self-cultivation is the paradigm for dealing with oneself, and moderation is the paradigm for dealing with things. Combining these three paradigms forms a special cultural system, which is the characteristic of Chinese culture. This is the second point we should promote. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Our reporter Cheng Jun</p>
<p>(1) On the Road from Hankou to Puqi</p>
<p>Rural bankruptcy is a widespread phenomenon throughout the country. After the natural and man-made disasters in Hubei, agricultural production has decreased, and farmers have lost their homes. The degree of bankruptcy is actually greater than in other provinces. We live in the city, our ears do not hear the cries of farmers, and our eyes do not see the tragic situation in the countryside. To talk about relief is nothing but self-deception. Therefore, the reporter went to the countryside to investigate the actual situation, so as to know where the crux lies and to explore ways to restore the situation. In addition to agricultural production, farmers' burdens, local disasters, and the sufferings of the masses as the main investigation materials, other water conservancy, dikes, mineral products, education, disaster relief, Qingxiang, Baojia, and other things closely related to the countryside are also within the scope of the investigation.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the morning on March 20th, I took a boat on the Yuehan Railway from Hankou to cross the river. At that time, the heavy snow had just cleared, the water was calm, and the willow color across the river was vying to send green greetings, which made my dusty heart feel open and bright. At seven o'clock, I got on the train at Xujiapeng in Wuchang. There were so many passengers that it was very crowded. The train carriages were simply equipped and did not pay attention to hygiene. People spit everywhere, and no one interfered. At eight o'clock, the train slowly started. It stopped at Dianyuqiao station and did not start again for more than an hour. At that time, the train carriage was shaking violently, which made people unbearable. I asked and learned that the sleepers on the road were mostly old things from the initial opening of the traffic in the third year of the Republic of China. They were rotten and could not be used, so no wonder. Now that the entire Yuehan Railway is about to open to traffic, this section of the road must be thoroughly rectified. There is a strange phenomenon on the train that is not found on other roads in the country, that is, there are dozens of vendors coming and going like weaving, shouting loudly, like the collapse of Tongshan in the east and the response of the Luoyang bells in the west. When the ticket inspector comes, they all avoid each other, some climbing to the top of the car, as agile as monkeys. When the ticket inspector leaves, they swarm down again, which makes the passengers feel uneasy. These are all poor people who are driven by hunger and cold. Although it is not necessary to strictly ban them, it seems necessary to add some restrictions. There were two passengers in the same car, one in plain clothes and one in military uniform. The military police asked to see their passports. They took out a piece of paper from their arms, which was stamped, and it was from the Wuchang County Government, ordering them to go to Shanpo and other places to collect taxes. I looked at the ticket, and there were dozens of people who were summoned. I smiled and said to the officials that this trip should be able to make a lot of money. They sighed and said that this was a good job in the past few years, but now the villagers have no food to eat, how can they provide a penny? They also said that some of their peers had gone on business trips and were hungry. If what they said is true, then the government is also afraid of the poverty of the people, and the King of Hell is also afraid of the thinness of the ghosts, and the poverty of the countryside can be imagined.</p>
<p>The train arrived at Heshengqiao and had entered Xianning. It is a more prosperous town in the county. Before long, it arrived in Xianning. The city gate is tightly opposite the station. There are high mountains behind the city. At a glance, you can tell that it is a place of strategic importance. Because I was eager to go to Puqi, I couldn't get off the train. I met a Xianning person in the train who talked about the situation in Xianning in great detail. The county is a third-class county with an area of 1,251 square kilometers, 125,404 mu of cultivated land, and a population of more than 140,000. The southeast is often dry, and the northwest suffers from waterlogging (now the water disaster has been reduced due to the completion of the Jinshui Dam). It has also suffered from banditry for a long time. Some of the land has been divided up. Security teams, strongmen teams, and anti-communist teams have all been organized. The security regiment's annual expenditure of 41,000 yuan is paid by the land, shops, tea, hemp, and paper donations, while the expenses of the armed strongmen team must be borne by the people themselves. At present, there are still remnants of bandits in the southwest, such as Baidun and Maqiao, and the areas bordering Yangquan and Banqiao in Puqi. Agricultural products are mainly paper, tea, and hemp. The paper mill produces 80,000 pieces of paper a year, worth 50,000 yuan; tea produces 30,000 dan, worth 200,000 yuan; and hemp produces 20,000 dan, worth more than 400,000 yuan. Recently, production has decreased, and sales have been sluggish. It is impossible for the people to make a living. I also asked about the situation of opium suppression and education. It is said that school education and social education are out of the question, and opium suppression still cannot avoid being relaxed, but there has been progress compared to the past.</p>
<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon, the train arrived at Tingshiqiao, which had entered Puqi. There, high mountains stand tall, and the atmosphere is magnificent. It is a vital road in the north and south, and a place that soldiers must contend for. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Army defeated Wu Peifu here. The fields were stained with blood, and the white bones supported the sky. When I look at it now, I can't help but feel sad about the wind and the sunset.</p>
<p>(2) Impressions of Puqi</p>
<p>I arrived in Beiqi at four o'clock on the 20th and stayed for two days. I got a lot of materials. The county is a first-class county. The first district administrative inspector is stationed here. The total county area is slightly over 158,025 square kilometers, the cultivated land is 225,053 mu, and the population is 181,640. It connects Xiang and Yue in the south and exits the Yangtze River in the west. It is a barrier to Wuhan. It was originally divided into five districts. The first district office was located in Xiangxiang, the second district office was located in Tingshiqiao, the third district office was located in Zhaoliqiao, the fourth district office was located in Chebu, and the fifth district office was located in Shenshan. Recently, it was changed to a district office and reduced to three districts. The first district office is located in the county seat, the second district office is located in Tingshiqiao, and the third district office is located in Xindian. Self-cultivating farmers account for 25%, tenant farmers account for 40%, and semi-self-cultivating farmers account for 35%. The largest products are tea, hemp, bamboo, and paper, which have always been famous. The people of Puqi like to boast about it. Yangloudong and Yanglousi are both tea-planting areas, producing more than 60,000 dan per year, which is a large output. Among agricultural products, rice produces more than 600,000 dan per year, hemp produces more than 5 million jin, and wheat, miscellaneous grains, and sweet potatoes produce a total of 50,000 dan per year. In addition to keeping grain for self-sufficiency, farmers can sell the rest, which is quite a joy to have a well-off family. In recent years, the Red Bandits have harassed the area, and the great drought in the previous year has exhausted the local vitality. The countryside is declining day by day. There is a large river in the county that originates in Tongshan, runs straight through the county seat, and enters the Yangtze River at Liuxikou. Every summer, mountain floods break out, and nearby fields and houses are flooded once. The people don't feel its pain, because mountain floods only affect the area near the river, and the whole county has a bumper harvest. In Puqi, there are nine years of rain and sunshine in ten years, and only one year suffers from drought. It can be said that it is blessed by nature, but most farmers are lazy and unwilling to work hard. If there is a major drought, they are too lazy to pump water for irrigation. In a good year, they waste the surplus on smoking and gambling. Therefore, although the land is fertile, the people are very poor. They do not know how to pay attention to water conservancy. Although the county river is not very harmful, the riverbed is getting higher day by day. In another ten years, the sand will reach half of the city. The people are indifferent to this. The ponds and dams in the villages are completely out of repair. Because there is a drought once every ten years, the ponds and dams lose their effectiveness. The people are lazy by nature, so why would they spend nine years of effort to save it for one year of use? And when there is a major drought in one year, there is no way to save it. During the great drought in the previous year, the government allocated deception work to repair the ponds. Huang Deyuan, the head of the second district, received 250 yuan, but only used 20 yuan to perfunctorily deal with it. The remaining 230 yuan was completely embezzled. Although it has been reported, it has not yet been concluded. It can be seen that the people of Puqi regard water conservancy as a child's play. It is no accident that agricultural production has decreased. Even tea, the main product, is declining day by day. At its peak, the Yangloudong tea garden produced 3 million catties per year, calculated at 16 taels per catty, and each catty was 9 yuan. Now it only produces more than 4 million small catties. There were 25 tea companies in the past, but now there are only 6 left. The nearby mountains, which used to be planted with tea trees and forests, are now bare. The burden on the people is not very heavy. In the past, the county government's expenses were insufficient, so it slightly collected tea donations, hemp industry shop donations, and fish industry shop donations, public security bureau shop donations, etc. to make up for it. Now they have all been abolished by the administrative commissioner's office. The mu donation is used to maintain security expenses, and one jiao is collected per mu. Compared with the eastern Hubei counties, which collect four or five jiao per mu, it is relatively light. But when I visited farmers' homes today, they still said that the mu donation was heavy, saying that it exceeded the regular tax. Because the regular tax has always been light, they feel that the mu donation is heavy. There is only one highway in the whole county. Bluestone roads are all over the county. They were all built by the people in the past. The county roads planned to be built are the Pu-Jia line, from Puqi to Jiayu, 30 kilometers long, and the Zhao-Xin line from Zhaoliqiao to Xindian, 12 kilometers long. It was decided to conscript labor to build them after the autumn farming season. Telephones from the county seat to Hongxia, from the county seat to Yangloudong, and from Yangquanfan to Tingshiqiao have all been erected and connected to calls, but the bamboo poles used as telephone poles are in danger of falling at any time. Education is not very developed. There is a junior high school in the county seat with three classes of students and three classes of attached complete elementary schools. There are only three complete elementary schools and 22 junior elementary schools in the villages. I visited the junior high school. Mr. Liang Ruilin, the principal of the school, led me to visit. The equipment is good, but the rest are simple and crude. Social education is almost non-existent. Only the county party department's civil education hall has remedial classes, which are only a symbolic addition. They are all in the county seat, and farmers have no chance to learn to read, so illiteracy accounts for 90% of the county. Opium has not yet been eradicated. The county seat, Xindian, and Shenshan all have Shicao shops, and it is said that there are still opium dens.</p>
<p>The county is adjacent to Xiang and Gan, and has suffered deeply from banditry in the past. The people of Tuqiao, Xiashan, Datian, Jingsha, Shiken, Yangquan, Hongshi, Xinxing, Yanglin, Baishi, Guantian, Longkeng, Xiaobai, Hongshan, and Doumen villages and towns were slaughtered by the communist bandits, and many died. At present, the First Army's Independent 35th Brigade and the Security Regiment are stationed in the county. Large groups of Red Bandits have disappeared, but sporadic small bandits, in groups of three or five, are still harassing everywhere. Recently, the Pingjiang banditry has become rampant again. A group is entrenched in Yaogushan, which borders four counties, and calls itself by the name of Xu Yangan. The people of Puqi then widely spread that Xu Bandit was not dead. The mountain where he is entrenched is pointed out by the people of Puqi from a distance to show it. The snow-covered peaks can still be vaguely seen. The people of the townships and towns have recently been ravaged by scattered bandits, and there are killings and injuries every day, and many have been kidnapped. They have come to the county seat to seek refuge, and spring plowing is almost abandoned. The only hope of the people is to eradicate the remaining bandits and stabilize order, and they have nothing else to ask for. I interviewed Chen Jicheng, the commander of the First Army and the commander-in-chief of the anti-banditry in the border area of Xiang, E, and Gan, and Yu Dian, the administrative commissioner of the First District, and had a long conversation with them. Chen said, "The three-province border area anti-banditry conference decided on a strategy, focusing on promoting politics and supplementing it with military affairs. At present, the remaining bandits take Pingjiang as their nest and roam the border area of Xiang and E. Although they are the old troops of Xu Yangan, Xu has indeed been captured and executed. The propaganda that Xu Bandit is still there is intended to frighten the people with false rumors. The result of the three-province anti-banditry conference is that I am also the commander of the anti-banditry in the First District and have the power to punish the civil officials in the district. Luo Lin is also the commander of the Second District and is stationed in Pingliu. Tan Daoyuan is the commander of the Third District and is stationed in Yichun. The troops are being concentrated separately and will start to encircle and suppress them immediately. At the latest, they can be eradicated within three months. It is decided to divide the anti-banditry into three steps. The first is the Qingxiang period, the second is the self-defense period, and the third is the Baojia period. After the bandits are cleared, we must promote politics with all our strength, and then we can have long-term peace and stability." Yu said, "At present, the only important policy is the four words of anti-banditry and pacifying the people. After the people live and work in peace and contentment, we will educate them and change their lazy customs. Although there are many other facilities, if they are not implemented well, they will disturb the people instead, and it is better to be quiet and do nothing." What the two said are all the urgent demands of the people, and it can be said that they are concise and to the point. The people of Puqi have a strong hope for anti-banditry. However, when there is a bandit alarm, they all hide it and do not report it. Even if they are subjected to official punishment, even being shot, they do not reveal a word. At first hearing, it is very contradictory, but the people of Puqi also have their own difficulties. In the past, when official troops and teams suppressed bandits, the people were happy to guide them, and there were those who tied up bandits to offer them. But as a result, the whole family would be killed by the bandits, and the government would not provide any protection. Moreover, if they reported the bandits' tracks, they would be detained first. If the bandits had left, they would be accused of spreading rumors. If the suppression failed, they would be falsely accused of being bandit spies. Later, it became a common practice. It is better to be ravaged by the Red Bandits than to report to the government. Chen's troops moved here from Daye, and the soldiers and civilians are still harmonious. However, the people are very dissatisfied with Li Zongjian's troops of the Independent 35th Brigade. It is said that the discipline of this unit is the worst in the country. Although some say it is an exaggeration, it is an indisputable fact that this unit does not care about the population.</p>
<p>When I visited the eastern township, I heard two things that made people feel unhappy. Hongxia in the eastern township is 40 li away from the city and is the border between Chongyang and Puqi. Two platoons of Li's troops are stationed there, one platoon leader is Hu Liangxian, and the other is Li Yuhe. They are both stationed in the house of Liu Maorong, who runs a paper shop. Liu's son, Mei Cai, married a woman named Sanyuan, who is young and beautiful. Hu and Li often made fun of her, causing her to be humiliated. On the nineteenth day of the first lunar month, Li Zailin and Li Changbao, shop assistants in Liu's shop, introduced four people from Pingjiang, including Li Qisheng, to work in the shop. Each carried a good citizen certificate issued by Pingjiang County. Hu, angry because of the humiliation, arrested Li Qisheng and the other four, subjected them to torture, and forced them to confess to being bandits. The Baozhang went to bail them out and was also detained. When Li Qisheng's family and the local Lianbao director and Baojia chiefs came to Puqi to rescue them on the 20th of this month, Li Qisheng and the other four had been shot. They had to take the corpses back to Xiang. Sanyuan was then raped and occupied by Hu. The other incident also happened in Hongxia. Two brothers were rowing a boat together. The elder brother rowed the boat away, and the younger brother went to look for them. It happened that Li's Brigade was suppressing bandits and arrested him. He was also beaten severely. Later, he was bailed out by the Chamber of Commerce and was able to save his life. If this is the case, it will be difficult for the soldiers and civilians to get along, and the future of anti-banditry will be greatly affected. I have not been to Hongxia, and I secretly hope that what I have said is not true. (Sent from Puqi on the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Measures to Aid Anhui Tea Production: Banks Provide Loans of 500,000 Yuan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Qimen Establishes Improvement Center, Reduces Transportation Costs, and Improves Communication in Yanhu. Anhui tea, renowned both domestically and internationally, has been affected by the overall decline of the rural economy on tea farmers.  Coupled with adherence to outdated practices and a failure to innovate, this has led to a sharp decline in production. Foreign trade has also steadily declined. According to preliminary statistics from the Anhui Provincial Tea Business Tax Bureau, exports for the 24th year of the Republic (1935) totaled only 179,479 dan.  Within this, the Huizhou region, including Shexian, Xiuning, and Qimen counties, accounted for more than two-thirds of the total. The National Economic Council, concerned that Anhui tea's position in the international market would be encroached upon by Indian and Ceylon tea if improvements and aid were not urgently implemented, convened the Ministry of Industry and the Anhui Provincial Government to establish a large-scale tea improvement center in Qimen, hoping to achieve tangible results. However, given the economic situation of tea farmers, aid was still necessary.  Recently, the provincial government dispatched Duan Tianjue, a technician from the Construction Department, and Hu Shiqi, a chief clerk from the Finance Department, together with Hu Haochuan, director of the Qimen Tea Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council, to Shanghai to negotiate loans with the banking sector.  The Bank of Communications agreed to cooperate with the Anhui Local Bank to provide a total of 500,000 yuan in production loans for Anhui tea. The Bank of Communications will provide 400,000 yuan, and the Anhui Local Bank will provide 100,000 yuan. The loan measures are divided into three categories: loan introduction, cooperative societies, and transportation and sales loans, which will be handled separately based on the urgency of their needs.  Personnel have already been dispatched to Qimen to establish an office and begin preparations. The Anhui Construction Department has specifically instructed the Anhui-Hefei, Provincial-Tunxi, and Wuhu-Tunxi highway vehicle management offices to reduce tea transportation rates to third-class rates as the tea market season approaches. The standard rate for third-class goods is set at six cents per quarter ton, according to the freight rates of five provinces and cities, to facilitate transportation. (March 23)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Jingxing Coal Sales Affected by Shanxi Military Actions <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Coal Stocks Along the Pinghan Railway Sold Out</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Jingxing Coal Mine has been significantly affected in its transportation due to the war in Shanxi. Coal prices in the north have increased, and future market prices will be even higher. Gu Zhongxiu, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Industry Supervision Committee, came to Beijing on the 15th to meet with Song Zheyuan. According to Gu's conversation, "The Jingxing Coal Mine was originally privately exploited by Germans.  When the Chinese government became aware of this, a Sino-German joint venture was implemented.  It was briefly taken back during World War I but then restored to its original status. Since the provincial government implemented supervision, production has increased even more.  Recently, daily coal production has been around 3,000 tons, with a record high of 3,200 tons, an achievement unseen in decades. The Zhengtai Railway Bureau provides ten trains daily to transport coal out of the mine, selling it throughout North China. Business is very prosperous. Monthly revenue can reach 480,000 to 490,000 yuan during peak season, and over 300,000 yuan during off-peak months. Currently, the total assets of the mine have reached 11 million yuan. The initial capital was only 300,000 taels, which shows the speed of its development. However, the railway connecting the mine to the Zhengtai Railway, originally built by the mine, has narrower tracks than the Zhengtai Railway. Therefore, daily coal transportation requires coal cars from the mine to be unloaded into coal cars on the Zhengtai Railway, which is not economical in terms of labor and time.  Recently, the Mining Supervision Committee decided to build a new railway line, moving the location to Weishui, which would shorten the route by two kilometers. The construction cost is 500,000 yuan, which will be drawn from the Jingxing Mine's surplus. Construction has not yet begun. Recently, due to military action in Shanxi, there are more military trains on the Zhengtai Railway. The Zhengtai Railway Bureau can only allocate five or six trains daily to transport coal. Therefore, the daily coal supply to various places is not enough to meet sales needs. Currently, coal stocks along the Pinghan Railway have been sold out, and prices are bound to rise. However, recent victories in the war in the west are expected to restore coal transportation on the Zhengtai Railway to its original state within days, and this situation should be alleviated."</p>
<p>"After the Lincheng Coal Mine was flooded, the mine conducted several surveys and concluded that the cost of dewatering would exceed the potential gains from mining.  Therefore, it was decided to abandon it and open a new mine in Cixian.  This plan has also been approved, but work has not yet begun. After the closure of the Lincheng Mine, all procedures were completed.  A recent report stated that 50,000 yuan was still owed in wages to employees.  This was owed by the previous business operation, before 1925. The mine was operated by a company organized by Li [blank space] and others.  Later, due to poor performance, it was taken over by the provincial government. At that time, the merchants reported losses of tens of millions of yuan, most of which were false. In reality, the losses were minimal, and this has been clarified.  There was already 50,000 yuan owed to employees at that time. Over time, many of the old workers were replaced. After the provincial government took over, employee wages were paid monthly, but the old debts were never addressed. This is the origin of the old workers' demand for repayment of the outstanding debts. The Hebei Province's new village resettlement program has been performing well in the past. This year, resettlement will continue. Recently, a suitable location was found in the Xiwuli area of Baotou, Suiyuan. The soil is very fertile and can accommodate more than 600 households.  It has been decided to build a new village there. This plan has been approved by the Hebei Provincial Government, but the actual situation still needs to be considered due to economic factors."</p>

<p>Zhongdetang Pharmacy on Beida Street in the city caught fire in the rear workshop at about 3:00 AM on the 23rd. The people in the store were sound asleep and no one noticed, so the fire became very intense. The roof was quickly burned through. By the time they got up and cried for help, it was impossible to put out the fire. The fire brigade arrived after being alerted, but the workshop was completely burned down. The store was filled with medicinal materials, all of which were reduced to ashes. The estimated loss is seven or eight hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Suzhou: The Provincial Silver Union Holds Annual Meeting Again in Suzhou</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Goldsmiths' Union held its annual meeting yesterday (the 24th) at the Lijegong Office of the Goldsmiths' Association in Liujia Bang, Jinmen, Suzhou.  More than 30 representatives from various counties, including Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Aoyang, Kunshan, Songjiang, Taiyu, Ru, and Jiangdu, including Xiang Ziqiao, Wang Zisun, and Wang Hongbin, attended.  A preparatory meeting was held in the morning. At noon, the Wuxian Goldsmiths' Association hosted a banquet for the representatives of the various counties.  The official meeting began at 2:00 PM.  Representatives from five counties, including Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Jiangdu, Wuxi, and Dongtai, were elected as the presidium. Cai Jilun, chairman of the presidium, gave an opening address and reported on the efforts to address the silver fineness issue. They had repeatedly resolved to jointly fight for a favorable outcome with representatives from various regions to the government, but had not yet achieved their goals.  Subsequently, representatives from various counties expressed their opinions, unanimously stating that if the government's prescribed method of using 30% silver and 70% impurities were followed for silver jewelry, the industry would be ruined and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of employees would be threatened, making a vigorous fight essential.  After discussion, seven people were selected as a delegation: Cai Jilun from Zhenjiang, Zhang Shanqing from Wuxi, Cheng Shuli from Wuxian, Zhuge Shenfu from Dongtai, Xiang Zigao from Jiangdu, Zhu Shouhe from Taixing, and Su Caifan from Changshu. They will join representatives from the three cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou, as well as the same trade from Zhejiang Province, to present the various difficulties and petition the Central Party Headquarters and various departments and ministries of the National Government, striving to achieve the goal of still using 100% silver for silver jewelry, to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers in the trade. The meeting then adjourned.  Some representatives left Suzhou that evening, while others will visit Dengwei Mountain in Guangfu Township today (the 25th) to view the plum blossoms.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Water Police Encircling Bandits on Taihu Lake</p>
<p>Winter defense has passed, and banditry on Taihu Lake has arisen. Robberies are frequently reported in villages around the lake.  A large group of lake bandits specializing in robbery has recently been discovered in the Xinkai River area of Nantai Lake, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Zhou Weilie, director of the Second Water Security District, reported that this group of lake bandits numbers over 100 and is well-equipped with firearms.  They are planning to operate in various townships of Wuxian County. Therefore, at 2:00 AM on the 24th, he dispatched Inspector Xue, along with a team of water police vessels and accompanying warship, from Suzhou to Nantai Lake. At the same time, the Wujiang County government also dispatched five or six teams of security forces and a water patrol team from Pingwang to join the encirclement.  It is also known that Zhejiang Province water police have also departed from Wuxing County to Taihu Lake to jointly encircle and suppress the bandits, hoping to quickly eliminate the lake bandits and maintain security in the rural areas.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Implementation of Urban Household Land Survey</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government had previously determined that land in various counties urgently needed to be surveyed and reorganized. Therefore, it first carried out urban land price declarations and aerial surveys in Wuxi and Nantong counties.  By the end of last year, both had been completed with good results. The County Land Bureau is now handling registration separately. However, urban land is densely packed with houses, and the terrain is complex, which cannot be handled by aerial surveys.  Therefore, the Provincial Government specially ordered the Provincial Land Bureau to dispatch an urban land surveying team to Wuxi in January of this year. The team established a traverse line group in Guanqian Street in the city center and began surveying the streets, alleys, and lanes.  Work within the city walls has now been completed and is progressing towards the urban areas outside the city.  The team leader, Xue Gansheng, and his staff arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou the day before yesterday to prepare for the urban household land survey.  It is also heard that the Provincial Land Bureau has ordered a large number of excellent surveyors who were surveying urban areas in Wuxian County to come to Wuxi soon to carry out the household survey.</p>
<p>Case of Gangster Beating Detective Transferred to Shanghai</p>
<p>Cai Jianchun from Taixing, a worker at a public stove in the Shenxiang area of the city, had an affair with Zhang Shao, a woman from Changshu. They were very intimate and planned to live together permanently.  On the 15th of last month, they hired Shi Haishan from Yancheng to write a document at the Wan'an Inn.  A patrol officer from the First Public Security Bureau arrived at the inn for inspection and found their behavior suspicious.  Upon inspection, a diary was found on Shi Haishan containing the phrases "Gao Yusheng killed detective Lu Guiqing at Chenjia Bridge, South Wharf, Shanghai," etc.  Considering the situation serious, the three men and women were sent to the General Bureau and then to the court for interrogation and detention. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, after learning of the above case, specially ordered Squad Leader Liu Bingyuan of the Detective Team to come to Wuxi with a document yesterday to greet and transfer them from the court.  Director Liu of the court ordered Shi to be brought to court for questioning before handing him over to Liu to transfer him to Shanghai for further investigation.</p>
<p>Trial of Teacher-Student Affair Begins</p>
<p>Jiu Fen, wife of Sun Zhonghao from Shitangwan in the Tenth District, was a teacher at Kangjiawan Tangwan Elementary School in the Laoximen area of Shanghai. She had an affair with student Chen Lin.  On the 10th of this month, Chen Lin came to Wuxi from Shanghai and met with Jiu Fen in a private room at the Shenjiang Hotel on Tonghui Road.  Her husband, Sun Zhonghao, discovered this and called the police, who arrested the adulterer and adulteress and sent them to the court for interrogation and detention.  After investigation, Prosecutor Shen filed a public lawsuit against them for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday (the 24th) morning at 10:00 AM, the first public hearing of the case was held. The defendant hired lawyer Tang Ying to appear in court for defense. Judge Liu Bingzhen opened the court and first questioned Chen Lin, who stated that he was 20 years old, from Shanghai, and that his relationship with Lu Jiu Fen was that of a teacher and a foster mother, and that they did not have an adulterous relationship.  He admitted that they had talked in the room. Judge then questioned Sun Lu Jiu Fen, who stated that she was 32 years old, from Shitangwan, Wuxi, and that she was formerly a teacher and is now at home. "Chen Lin and I are indeed teacher and foster mother. The teahouse waiter at the Shenjiang Hotel said that Chen Lin and I stayed for four or five days. This was entirely fabricated by the plaintiff. In June of last year, the plaintiff asked me for an unconditional divorce, which I did not agree to. His sister's affairs in Shanghai have nothing to do with him. If there is anything disreputable, he can report it to the police for investigation." She completely denied the adultery. Next, Sun Zhonghao stated that he was 33 years old, from Shitangwan, and an office worker at the Dahua Paint Factory in Longhua, Shanghai. "Lu Jiu Fen is my wife. We have been married for over ten years. At first, we respected each other as husband and wife. Later, after she had an affair with Chen Lin (also known as Chen Shiming), she left a letter and ran away from Shanghai on September 18th of last year, and paid 100 yuan at the exchange to flee to Mu Du, Suzhou. I went to find her and persuaded her to go home, but she did not agree. At this point, I was extremely heartbroken. As this case involves morality, I request the judge to investigate it severely," and so on. At this point, the clock struck twelve, and Judge Liu adjourned until 2:00 PM to continue the trial. First, Sun Zhonghao was questioned, then Chen Lin and Jiu Fen. Finally, lawyer Tang Ying came out to defend Chen Lin. The trial ended at about 4:00 PM. The audience was very crowded, reaching over 200 people. As a result of the court hearing, Lu Jiu Fen was released on bail, guaranteed by the Hengda Watch &amp; Glasses Company on Tongyun Road and Hu Zaiping. Sun Zhonghao was ordered to return home, and Chen Lin was returned to custody to await review.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang: National Goods Year Opens Today</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial National Goods Year will be inaugurated at 9:00 AM on the 25th at the Provincial Party Headquarters. The National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association held a lantern rehearsal this morning at 8:00 AM. Various businesses gathered their lanterns at the Chamber of Commerce. Fireworks will be set off at the Provincial Stadium at 6:00 PM in the evening. A National Goods Discount Week will also be held starting tomorrow. Various national goods merchants preparing for the discount sale are requesting the Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the National Goods Year Implementation Committee, requesting an extension of the discount week by one week, as the discount period is only scheduled for one week, while the number of goods imported by each store is extremely large. The Chamber of Commerce, after receiving the request, considered the reasons presented to be sufficient. It is heard that it has forwarded a letter to the committee to approve the extension of the deadline.</p>
<p>Jiading: Seizure of Smuggled Rayon</p>
<p>Criminals from Southern Fujian and Northern China have organized an organization to smuggle goods, affecting customs revenue. The government is taking measures to prevent this. Smuggled goods have been repeatedly discovered in Nanxiang and Luodian in this county in previous years. The Shanghai Customs sent personnel to intercept a large batch of rayon at Nanxiang Jinghu Railway Station. It is heard that these smuggled goods were shipped from Tianjin. Recently, these people have been shipping the goods to Suzhou Station via the Jinghu Railway, where they are unloaded and reloaded onto cars for transportation to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway. On the 21st, the Shanghai anti-smuggling agency learned of the situation and sent personnel with police to intercept a car at Luoyang Bridge Station in this county, containing 20 packages of smuggled rayon. They were taken to Shanghai for investigation.</p>

<p>The 15th election of the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association for the individual member group is scheduled to be held on March 27th for voting and March 28th for counting the ballots. A total of 9,663 ballots were handed over to the post office for delivery yesterday afternoon. The details of each [blank] are recorded below:</p>
<p>Those present at the meeting yesterday afternoon included Li Yuxuan of the Guangdong Native Place Association, Wu Rulin of the Money Trade Association, Ye Jia and Liu Zhongying and Zhang Yiqing of the Citizens' Federation, Xu Jichang and Fang Jiaobo of the Taxpayers' Association, Dong Xinqin of the Ningbo Native Place Association, Cao Zhigong of the Huining Native Place Association, Qian Youlan of the Shaoxing Native Place Association, Zheng Dongshan of the Citizens' Association for National Goods, Jin Runxiang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hu Fengxiang of the Citizens' National Goods Year Association, Lin Kanghou of the Bankers' Association, Gu Wensheng of the Pudong Native Place Association, Zhu Zhichun and Huang Guicheng of the Municipal Federation Branch, and 17 others. Chairman Xu Jiching reported on the investigation and checked the ballots. He then designated Liu Shenying, Zhu Zhichun, and Huang Guicheng as three representatives to escort a large number of ballots to the Shanghai Post Office to show solemnity.</p>
<p>The written report of Chairman Xu Jiching regarding the investigation stated: "In this election, in addition to publishing notices in newspapers and soliciting taxpayers to come to the association to fill out forms, the association also pre-filled the names of taxpayers in the survey form based on the membership list of the previous session, and then sent personnel to conduct investigations separately. If there were no changes, it remained the same, and the taxpayer only needed to stamp the survey form to prove it. If there were any changes, it was filled out separately. By the end of December of last year, a total of 7,487 old and new survey forms were received, and 2,842 survey forms were sent by various groups, totaling 10,329. Before compiling the roster, after excluding duplicates and those who did not meet the requirements, the actual number was 9,672. Therefore, the draft number of the election roster was 9,672. After the investigation was completed, the election roster was compiled, with and without the right to be elected. On March 8, it was announced in the newspaper in accordance with election conventions. After compiling the draft number of the electors' name roster, four duplicates and three deceased people were found again, so the actual number was only 9,665. Among them, 6,120 had the right to vote, and 3,545 also had the right to be elected. Therefore, the election roster's official number is 6,665, and the number of election ballots issued in Shanghai is 9,665, which matches the above numbers. Please refer to the investigation statistics table. Also, after the election ballot numbers were determined, electors He Zhongxiao, number 376, and Li Jueshan, number 941, passed away, so the election ballots for those numbers were stopped from being issued. Therefore, the total number of ballots actually issued was 9,663. This is combined and stated on March 24, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e94">River Water in Sichuan Rising: Passenger Transport Now Possible <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai steamer that departed yesterday evening for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, above Yichang, had been unable to navigate the Sichuan river route because the water level had dropped to just two inches above the riverbed. This matter was previously reported in this newspaper. Recently, the water level has slightly risen, and passenger steamers can now barely make their way to Chongqing. A ship also departed from Shanghai yesterday. The detailed situation is described below.</p>
<p>Fuyang First to Enter Sichuan: The Sanbei Company's Sichuan River steamer Fuyang was forced to stop downstream of Yichang due to the shallow water levels in the upper reaches. It was unable to pass through the shallow waters and remained anchored for over ten days. More than ten other Chinese and foreign merchant steamers were also stranded. Yesterday, this newspaper received a telegram from Yichang stating that the water level in the upper river was gradually rising and that with a south wind, it would rise further, allowing navigation. The Sanbei Fuyang has already loaded passengers (without carrying goods) and set off for Chongqing as the first to go. It has already passed through the shallowest areas.</p>
<p>Guangyao Departs Shanghai with Cargo: The Minsheng Company also received a telegram from Sichuan yesterday stating that the upper river was rising and navigable for a short period of time. A large amount of cargo has accumulated in Shanghai, and there is a great need in Sichuan. The company was ordered to load cargo first. Therefore, the company began loading passengers and cargo onto the Guangyao steamer yesterday to enter Sichuan. It is hoped that the river water will have risen by the time the ship arrives in Yichang, allowing the steamer to enter Sichuan. If the water level has not risen, then a portion of the cargo will be unloaded when it arrives in Yichang, and then it will sail upstream.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Aviation Association initiated a fundraising campaign in this city to collect one million yuan to purchase ten aircraft and form them into a squadron, to be named the "Zhongzheng Team," to be presented to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as a birthday gift. A Fundraising and Aircraft Purchasing Committee for Birthday Wishes was organized and has been actively preparing for several days. It has also united various sectors, organizations, groups, and individuals as initiators. The Seamen's Special Party Branch, Seamen's Union, Exchange, and Public Security Bureau have been raising funds separately, as reported in various newspapers. The committee received replies from the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association yesterday.

This association will always follow, it is hoped that you will take this into consideration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the work of the Chief Captain's Office is admired, and the entire city and various organizations are enthusiastically devoted to promoting it, demonstrating the people's patriotism. Zhou Xieji Radio Station and Mr. Zhang Xiangshan came forward and offered to raise donations on their behalf.

<p>In the past, Yangtze River ships passing through Jiangyin only paused briefly to allow passengers to board and disembark. They did not berth at the pier. There is a large amount of cargo transported from Jiangyin to Hankou and Sichuan, which has caused great inconvenience for passengers. Recently, the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, in order to develop transportation and aid the rural areas, repeatedly consulted with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting that it overcome all difficulties from the standpoint of a state-run enterprise. All of the company's Yangtze River ships, when traveling from Shanghai to Hankou, must berth at the pier to transport goods and board and disembark passengers. Cai Zengji, in particular, convened meetings with the masters of various Yangtze River ships many times and designated that they berth at the open pier when arriving in Jiangyin. This was resolved as of yesterday. Starting with the Jiangda steamer leaving tonight, all ships will be notified and a telegram has been sent to the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce for their information and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e100">National Mining Association Cables Request to Cancel Coal Tax in Guangdong <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Release Shipments with Ministry of Finance Licenses to Maintain the Mining Industry</p>
<p>The National Mining Association of China, in response to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance's collection of a tax on imported coal, cabled the Guangdong authorities yesterday to immediately cancel the tax and release shipments upon verification of the tax-paid licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance in order to maintain the mining industry. The original cable stated, "To the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Department of Finance: Regarding the tax on domestic coal, the Ministry of Finance has established uniform measures, dispatching personnel to the mines to collect the tax and issue tax-paid licenses, without imposing additional taxes. However, your province has issued an order, effective from January 27th of this year, imposing a coal tax of 50 cents per ton on imported coal, which is collected by the Local Agricultural Products Miscellaneous Special Tax Bureau. This has caused great alarm among the mines. This illegal and excessive tax not only violates the national unified tax system and hinders the mines' sales prospects but also undermines the provincial plan. Guangdong's coal production is limited and relies entirely on coal from other provinces. The excessive coal tax will reduce imports and impede the province's industrial and commercial enterprises. We request that you consider this and immediately cancel the tax. All imported coal should be released tax-free upon verification of the tax-paid license issued by the Ministry of Finance in order to maintain the mining industry," Chairman Wang Zhengting.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Suggestions from Executive Committee Members Ye Jiaxing and Others of the Ratepayers' Association: Cease Interference with the Collection of Aviation Donations: Leaseholds Not Comparable to Colonies; A Strong Protest Should Be Made Based on Reason <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Due to the interference by the Shanghai Municipal Council with the collection of donations for aviation and national salvation, Executive Committee members Ye Jiaxing and Gu Wensheng of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Leasehold yesterday proposed a serious negotiation to cease the interference. The original proposal is recorded below. "The authorities of the Shanghai Public Leasehold and the French Leasehold have recently and abruptly prevented the collection of aviation donations in hotels within the two special districts and have confiscated all receipts and account books, or even revoked business licenses. The extent of their imposition of pressure and suppression of patriotic movements has reached an extreme. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? It is requested that the Association argue the case based on reason and conduct a serious negotiation." The reasons are attached below for discussion. "(Reasons) The opening of the Leaseholds is not comparable to colonies, and the citizens within the Leaseholds are definitely not residents of colonies. In other words, the citizens within the Leaseholds have their own absolute autonomy and can absolutely express their patriotic feelings. Therefore, the collection of aviation donations by the hotel industry, etc., within the two Leaseholds is a citizen's duty to their country and should not be interfered with by the Leasehold administrative authorities. Moreover, at the beginning of the collection, our government followed diplomatic practice and assisted the two Leaseholds, and the Leasehold authorities expressed their agreement. Now, they have suddenly prevented it, which is not only contradictory but also treats the people's voluntary aviation donation movement as a child's play. The national character of our Republic of China still exists. Therefore, this Association, as the representative spokesperson for the Chinese ratepayers within the Leaseholds, should argue the case based on reason and conduct a serious negotiation until the goal of continuing to collect is achieved. This is our opinion, and we respectfully request a decision."</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Xin Jiangtian Case Reopened for Arbitration Yesterday: Testimony Taken from Chen Tianxiao <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian steamer colliding with and sinking the civilian ship Jin Wanli at Yawo Shoal has already been decided by the Collision Arbitration Committee. However, because the testimony of the Jin Wanli boatman Chen Tianxiao had not yet been taken, the arbitrators convened again yesterday afternoon to question him. Chen Tianxiao's testimony is recorded below. Chen Tianxiao, from Huangyan, 40 years old, boatman, 10 years of experience, only started as Jin Wanli boatman last year, always travelling the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Departed from Wusong at 3:00 AM on the 18th. The sky was dark, but very clear. Wind direction, northeast wind. Tide, at half-tide. Exited along the southern foot of the inner buoy. Steamed with the compass heading east by south. Saw the buoys on the water. Did not see the buoy ahead. After passing the black buoy, saw a ship at anchor about two li ahead. Saw the red and white lights of the approaching ship, directly in front of our ship, and immediately paid attention. After steaming for another li, to be safe, we slightly turned our rudder, but suddenly saw the red and green lights of the approaching ship, and it immediately collided with our ship. The wooden ship's lamp was placed on the left side of the cabin, about one person high from the boat. There was only one lamp on the boat. There were two people on the bow looking out. The bow of the Xin Jiangtian collided with the bow of our ship on the left side. The bow of our ship immediately sank after the collision. I was on the ship and put down the sampan. There were eight people in total in the stern. All eight people jumped onto the sampan. Two people were on the bow and fell into the water immediately after the collision, I did not see them. One person was in the cabin and did not have time to jump onto the sampan, so he was drowned. I never heard the Xin Jiangtian pull back. There were no oars on the sampan. Later, we drifted by wind to Wangjiawan, Pudong. The US Consulate General is reportedly relocating from the old Hotel Cleyer location to the newly completed high-rise building at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road.

<h3 id="e114">Completion of Last Year's Agricultural Loans <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Agricultural Lending Syndicate is a joint venture of ten banks: Bank of Communications, Bank of Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Jin City Bank, New China Bank, Central China Bank, Continental Bank, Guohua Bank, Chinese Farmers' Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Association. Agricultural lending for the 1935 fiscal year has been completed and is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the month. The loans are divided into production, transportation, and beneficial uses, with the area being Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Shipping Industry Association Investigates General Conditions of Vessel Freight <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association has issued a notice to various shipping companies, stating, "It has been noted that advanced shipping nations in the West conduct detailed investigations into various aspects of their national vessels and publish them in various magazines for reference. All companies engaged in the shipping industry also provide as much information as possible for reporting purposes in order to develop shipping and improve operations. In the Far East, countries such as Japan have seen a rapid increase in the number of ships and a thriving shipping industry in recent years. The reason for this is due to the government's support and effective management. Information on maritime transport, materials, and market conditions for goods has never been considered confidential. The "Marine Transport" and "Marine Transport Statistics Monthly Report" published by the Japan Maritime Transport Association are detailed and contribute to the promotion of the shipping industry. In contrast, there is very little reference to such records in China, which hinders the shipping industry. In light of this, the Association has printed a "Vessel Freight Overview Investigation Table" and will begin by investigating the freight transport situation of vessels without fixed routes in order to compile statistics and publish them in the Shipping Monthly to promote publicity and development. We are sending you a copy of the investigation table and request that you fill it out with the freight rates of all ships owned or represented by your company from January 1st of this year and return it to the Association for compilation. We greatly appreciate your cooperation." The Vessel Freight Overview Investigation Table includes: Vessel Name, Goods Transported (by type and quantity), Loading Date, Route, Freight Charges, Vessel User (Owner, Agent, Charterer), and Remarks.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The United Factories Association Requests Guangdong Province to Exempt Rubber Shoe Tax <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Machine-Made National Product Factories yesterday submitted a request to the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department to exempt the minor rubber shoe tax. The original text stated, "Submitting this request for machine-made national products, urging the conversion to exemption of imported goods tax, in order to benefit national products." The letter from member Zhengtian Xinji Rubber Factory stated, "Recently, we received a letter from Shantou Hakka Dingda Firm stating that the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department has established a special tax bureau for imported agricultural products and miscellaneous items within the province, and rubber-soled cloth shoes imported from outside the province are also handled according to this regulation, with a tax of five cents per pair, or sixty cents per dozen, about to be levied. Please negotiate reasonably to reduce the burden," etc. According to the factory, the "Daxi" and "Huili" brand rubber-soled cloth shoes manufactured by our factory are sold throughout Guangdong. If a heavy tax of sixty cents per dozen is levied, the impact will inevitably lead to zero sales of our factory's products. Moreover, this regulation was originally designed to resist imported goods, so it specifically targets imports. It is incomprehensible that it now affects national products. Furthermore, Shanghai and Guangdong are both territories of the Republic of China. How can imports and national products from outside the province be equated? If our factory's rubber-soled cloth shoes are taxed because the rubber belongs to imports, then Guangzhou's cloth-surface rubber-soled shoes should also be taxed as imported goods based on their rubber, in order to be fair. Otherwise, it would inevitably be biased. This matter concerns the development of national products. We request your association to appeal on our behalf, and we would be extremely grateful," etc. Upon investigation by the association, the "Daxi" and "Huili" brand rubber-soled cloth shoes produced by Zhengtian Xinji Rubber Factory are indeed machine-made national products and are exempt from imported miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, we specifically submit this request, hoping that your department will review and approve it, ordering the Shantou Special Tax Bureau and other special tax bureaus to uniformly exempt the tax, which would be of public benefit.</p>

<p>According to the International Trade Bureau's statistics, the total export of tung oil nationwide last year was 738,865 metric tons, with a value of 41,158,270 yuan in national currency. This is an increase of 86,029 metric tons compared to the previous year. However, according to the bureau's information, the export volume last year was still less than that of 1933, and the value was also less than that of 1930. Tung oil is a unique product of our country and has a monopoly in the world market. Currently, only the United States is experimenting with tung tree planting. If improvements can be made, such as increasing oil production and improving packaging, attention should be paid to these aspects.</p>
<p>The Rent Reduction Association Petitions the Municipal Government to Swiftly Establish a Rent Dispute Mediation Committee, Legally Resolve Disputes, and Relieve the People's Hardship; Requesting Permission to Send Representatives to Participate and Provide Opinions</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly serious rent disputes in Shanghai, the Rent Reduction Associations of various districts in the city believe that if a Rent Dispute Mediation Committee is not established as soon as possible, the social situation will become even more alarming. Therefore, yesterday, they submitted a petition to Mayor Wu, requesting him to promptly establish a Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Measures passed by the Executive Yuan's meeting, and to allow the Association to send one representative to participate as a committee member, in order to contribute opinions as much as possible. The petition stated, "We petition to promptly organize a Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Committee to relieve the people's hardship and resolve rent disputes, and request permission for our Association to send a representative to participate. Upon investigation, rent disputes and litigation involving rental businesses in both the Chinese and foreign concessions of this city have become a serious problem. Now, the Executive Yuan, concerned about the people's livelihood and resolving rent disputes, convened a meeting on the 12th of last month, bringing together representatives from the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry, as well as special municipalities, to discuss the Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Measures, totaling 17 articles, which have been published in the Lu Bu Shen Xin newspapers. However, the implementation date of these measures and the selection of personnel to handle rent disputes require the local competent authorities, courts, and Party headquarters to each send one representative to form a Mediation Committee, and to draft detailed rules to be submitted for approval before implementation. Currently, cases of litigation due to rent disputes in Shanghai are heard daily, accounting for a large portion of the cases accepted by the courts each day, indicating that rent disputes in Shanghai have reached a boiling point. Unless a Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Committee is quickly organized, the social situation may enter a state of panic and become irreparable. In view of this, our Association specifically submits this petition to you, sir, to promptly organize a Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Measures passed by the Executive Yuan's meeting, to relieve the people's hardship and resolve disputes. Furthermore, attention should be paid to land prices and construction costs, and appropriate and close mediation measures should be implemented. Moreover, our Association is the central hub of rent reduction organizations throughout Shanghai, and is more familiar with rental matters and past situations in various lanes and alleys in Shanghai. Therefore, we dare to petition you, sir, that in the future organization of the Shanghai Rent Dispute Mediation Committee, permission be granted to appoint one representative to participate as a member of the Mediation Committee, in order to provide opinions and facilitate the resolution of disputes, which would be of public benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<p>Last summer, rivers flooded, causing disasters in ten provinces. The situation was dire and unprecedented. The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road in this city, held activities for the Jianghe River flood disaster relief. They sent out numerous letters and telegrams domestically and internationally, appealing for donations. The substantial amount of relief supplies and funds received were used to help disaster victims, saving many lives. In addition to the generous donations from domestic philanthropists and overseas Chinese, Westerners also donated enthusiastically. For example, the American China Famine Relief Association specifically allocated 50,000 yuan in national currency to carry out work relief in northern Jiangsu, demonstrating their admiration for universal love. Recently, we heard that a New Zealand philanthropist, Mr. Hender, donated 25 pounds, which he had accumulated through hard work, equivalent to more than 400 yuan in national currency. He sent it to Mr. Alley, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession in this city, entrusting him to forward it to the China International Famine Relief Commission for distribution and relief to the disaster victims. This philanthropist's disaster relief and compassion for neighbors, his love of giving and joy in doing good, is truly worthy of emulation by the world.</p>

<p>Suicide Note States Lack of Interest in Life</p>
<p>Heartless Woman Shortens a Man's Life: According to the Japanese newspaper "Riri Nichinichi Shimbun," Kawatachu Yuuxio, a clerk at a foreign firm on Haining Road from Nara Prefecture, had dinner with his boss last night. He was drunk and depressed. He went to a Japanese coffee shop on Hongjiang Road. A waitress named Takako, with whom Kawatachu had a relationship, was there. They drank coffee together until 11 p.m., then Kawatachu said goodbye to Takako and went alone to his boss's factory. He obtained a heavy amount of chromic acid, mixed it with ten grams of hydrochloric acid, and ingested it. Factory workers discovered the incident and rushed him to Fukumin Hospital. Fortunately, the time was short, and his life was not in danger. After investigating the cause of Kawatachu's suicide, it was found that Takako's attitude towards him had become cold recently, which led to his despair. A suicide note was found in his pocket, stating, "I have lacked interest in life for three years, and a heartless woman shortens a man's life," and other words.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the body was examined by the court and handed over to his mother for burial. Wang Jisheng, a 23-year-old employee of the Hongxiang Silver Shop on 723 Xinzha Road from Shaoxing, had worked there for eight years and was highly valued by the owner. Recently, Wang suddenly worried that his job might be eliminated, leaving him unemployed and unable to make a living. Overcome with these thoughts, he became disillusioned with life. The day before yesterday, he went alone to the Xinzha Hotel, Room 305, under the alias Wang Jiying, and secretly swallowed potassium cyanide, a poisonous substance, to commit suicide. Around 3 a.m. yesterday morning, he began to suffer from the poison and cried out in pain, which was heard outside the room by the hotel tea boy Huang Rongqing. Seeing that the door was locked, he managed to climb in through the window and, upon seeing the situation, immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent officer Wang Shidong to investigate. An ambulance was summoned, but he died before reaching the Red Cross Hospital. The body was then transferred to the Philan Road mortuary for examination. Around 10 a.m., Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. According to the police report, Tang confirmed that the deceased, Wang Jisheng, was male and had died from ingesting potassium cyanide. The body was handed over to his mother, Wang Yang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Dr. Ding Huikang Discusses the Implementation Methods of Tuberculosis Prevention in China <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>National Disease Insurance Endorsed as Key to Successful TB Prevention</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium in Shanghai, recently gave a lecture on the issue of tuberculosis prevention at the National Shanghai Medical College's commemorative week. He stated that the scope of tuberculosis prevention is extremely broad. Even in countries with advanced medical care, although the mortality rate of tuberculosis has decreased due to advances in medicine, the risk of infection has not diminished. The latest German tuberculosis prevention regulations have not yet been promulgated, and Norway's compulsory hospitalization of patients for treatment, which addresses the root cause, is highly commendable. Given the current complex situation in China, the progress of tuberculosis prevention is not only viewed with indifference by the general public, but even those in the medical field feel helpless. However, considering the severity of the situation, it is imperative that the entire nation work together to undertake this arduous task. Below are my personal suggestions for the implementation of tuberculosis prevention: Medical community has an obligation to report.</p>
<p>The medical community should be at the forefront of tuberculosis prevention and should have an obligation to report tuberculosis patients. This way, within a reasonable period, it is not difficult to obtain tuberculosis statistics. In other words, all severely ill patients (i.e., those who pose a risk of infection) can be clearly statistically tracked after reporting is implemented. Implementation of group checks. Tuberculosis is a kind of communicable disease. X-ray group checks should be performed in all public places such as factories, schools, and companies. Those who are sick should be screened out and isolated. In this way, the risk of transmission can be reduced. This should be done in cooperation between public groups and hospitals. Even general residents who consider themselves healthy should have an X-ray examination by a doctor every year. Attention should be paid to those in an environment with a risk of tuberculosis transmission. Implementation of a method to eliminate the root cause of tuberculosis. All patients with open tuberculosis should be required to be hospitalized for treatment. Their homes should be disinfected. Addressing the root cause is paramount. The authorities should first investigate the number of hospital beds in the city. In the current situation in China, the construction of sanatoriums is also an urgent task. However, whether the architecture should adopt a ward system, a village system, or a mixed system is still a question. Improvement of treatment methods. Currently, natural therapy and condensation surgery are the two most important treatment methods. More importantly, early diagnosis is crucial. Therefore, it is advisable to set up more tuberculosis testing centers in various places, with X-ray and artificial pneumothorax equipment, not only for early diagnosis for the general public, but also for use by private practitioners in the city. Research on tuberculosis drugs. At present, no tuberculosis drugs have been invented in various countries, while China alone has many of them. At the same time, there are many tuberculosis patients in China. What is the crux of the problem? I feel that there is a need for research. Generally speaking, people prefer the convenience of taking medicine rather than the trouble of seeing a doctor. However, if they only see a doctor after the medicine is ineffective, not only do they miss their personal proper treatment period, but the degree of risk of transmission will also increase several times invisibly. This is a serious problem in tuberculosis prevention. Improvement of public health. This is a very broad issue that should be studied by experts. However, in terms of China's social situation, banning spitting is the most important thing. This should be promoted with all efforts. All public institutions and entertainment venues, tickets, and advertisements must have very clear text slogans and pictures, so that everyone is shocked and no longer spits. After one or two years, it may be possible to achieve the goal, and its effectiveness can at least reduce the risk of infection, which is important in tuberculosis prevention. Attention to eugenics. This issue should also be studied by experts. Whether tuberculosis has hereditary properties is still being studied. For example, the Koch Institute in Berlin is raising 3,400 mice to study this hereditary issue. For now, let's not discuss it. However, in terms of the marriage of tuberculosis patients, it not only has a great impact on their personal health, but also has a very high risk of transmission to the other party and their children. This is an inevitable fact. Therefore, from the perspective of tuberculosis prevention, before marriage, both parties should ask a doctor to check the health of their lungs, and then the authorities can issue a marriage certificate. Tuberculosis Museum. It is undeniable that there are many illiterate people in China. In addition, the public's knowledge is shallow. It is difficult to achieve results with text propaganda alone. A tuberculosis museum should be established. The causes of tuberculosis, the routes of transmission, pathological changes, X-ray changes, treatment methods, attention to daily life, and various statistics should all be displayed with pictures and specimens so that viewers can understand at a glance and deeply know the risk of infection and proper treatment methods. The effect will be considerable. Organization of disease insurance. The soundness of this organization is directly proportional to the degree of development of a country's medicine. In China, most patients cannot afford to see a doctor, doctors do not have a fixed income, and their lives cannot be guaranteed. Hospital income is too low and must rely on public and charitable subsidies. Specialized research institutes and complete graduate schools are even unable to develop. Therefore, it is difficult to make progress. Medicine is a noble and positive construction undertaking. Even with national financial resources, it is difficult to maintain. Therefore, this undertaking should be organized by the people of the whole country, the government, and specialized insurance institutions through close cooperation, so that the people have medical security, doctors have a reasonable income, and hospitals have reliable recurring expenses. Then all medical construction can be actively developed. As for tuberculosis prevention, if the disease insurance organization can be fully popularized, the people will have the ability to have early diagnosis and proper treatment, and specialized sanatoriums and research institutes can be established accordingly. Not only can the development of medicine be expected, but the difficult problems of tuberculosis prevention can also be more than half resolved. The above sections may seem unremarkable, but in practice, their implementation not only requires huge economic support, but also considerable time and effort from specialized personnel. A strong and effective organization must be established between social people, private practitioners, university hospitals, and health agencies, and then macroscopic effects can be achieved. This is what we hope for from the joint efforts of our comrades.</p>

<p>Chen Liangyu from Zhenhai is a gentleman in Shanghai. This month, the 29th, is his 70th birthday and also his 50th wedding anniversary, as well as his 40th anniversary in Shanghai. All acquaintances and relatives and friends congratulated him. Mr. Chen, seeing the difficulties of the times, did not want to be extravagant and wanted to transfer all the birthday gifts received from relatives and friends to the Zhabei Police Hospital and the Ningbo Shahe Baosheng Hospital to raise funds for the police. Relatives and friends agreed with this idea.

<h3 id="e130">Silk and Satin Industry in Hangzhou and Shengze jointly request rectification of industry regulations <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Trade Association issues open letter to all sectors</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: Recently, competition among retail silk and satin merchants has intensified. The Shanghai Silk and Satin Trade Association previously issued earnest warnings to the Hangzhou Silk Group and the Shengze Silk Group of the association. Because one or two silk and satin stores were selling real silk spun satin at 5.1 fen per foot to attract customers, various customer groups seized on this as an excuse, and rumors spread overseas, raising doubts about the quality and cost of spun satin. Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Shengze have always been regions producing real silk spun satin, and there is deep concern about impacting sales and endangering the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Trade Association, requesting correction in accordance with the association's general principles, and requesting a meeting to be convened to effectively rectify industry regulations. The Silk and Satin Association also issued an open letter to all sectors yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Open Letter to All Sectors Silk and Satin Trade Association's Announcement to All Sectors: Silk and satin are unique products of our country with a long history, sold both domestically and abroad, used as attire, and welcomed for their durability and beauty. Silk and satin are the result of much human effort and labor; as the saying goes, "every thread is hard-won." From this, it can be understood that although commodity prices have fallen in recent years, there is no reason for silk and satin to be sold at a few fen per foot. Normally, the cost of silk production does not differ greatly; therefore, the selling price of silk and satin should not vary too much. The silk and satin business focuses on small profits and quick turnover. Even when selling at cost, the price should be between 80% and 90% of the original price. Anything beyond this limit is deception, or just old silk and rotten silk. In the past, silk and satin merchants competed by carefully researching ways to improve products and reduce costs by saving expenses. Now, a few retail silk merchants abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial, going against the right path. When purchasing goods, they only seek low prices, regardless of quality, in order to make it easier to sell quickly. When selling, they rely on extensive advertising to attract customers, disregarding the increasing business expenses. According to the Dou Shi market, a silk and satin store's daily business is only two or three thousand yuan, but the daily advertising expenses often account for hundreds of yuan. These extra losses must inevitably be borne by the customers. Given this, who can still believe that there are cheap deals for customers? This association, in order to save the reputation of national silk and maintain commercial ethics, believes that it is necessary to correct and put these business malpractices of the industry on the right track. In addition to earnest advice, we must carefully select goods and reduce operating costs to meet the needs of all sectors with affordable and high-quality products. It is well known that what customers want is "genuine goods at fair prices," not just being swayed by deceptive advertising. Now, at the expense of repetition, we hereby formally announce the following, hoping for public understanding: 1. Since ancient times, cheap prices rarely mean good quality. Silk and satin prices have their own reasonable standards. If someone uses unusually low prices to sensationalize, or even uses sacrifices and giveaways to attract attention, their purpose is to lure customers and profit from them. There are definitely no cheap goods. 2. The more intense the advertising, the higher the operating costs, and it can be concluded that there are no cheap goods. 3. All those who advertise "buy one foot, get one foot free" or "buy one, get several free" must have raised the price of the foot of silk itself and have no good goods. 4. All those who limit the time to sell one or two so-called cheap goods for a limited time are not only difficult to buy but also risk being squeezed and injured, resulting in a greater loss than gain. 5. All those who use gifts to please customers should know that the gifts have already been secretly added to the price of the goods, which is no different from paying to buy the gifts. 6. All those who advertise closing sales or clearance auctions often replenish stock as they sell, which is actually a disguised form of opening a store. There are neither good goods nor cheap prices, so please do not be deceived.</p>
<p>Letter from the Two Groups: To whom it may concern, our country's silk and satin business has always valued genuine goods at fair prices, and honesty with all, young and old. In recent times, retail stores, under the guise of commercial warfare, engage in acts of mutual sabotage. Banners of massive discounts are displayed throughout the city. Sacrificing and giving away feet, and buying one and getting several free, are advertised through newspapers and radio broadcasts. Creativity knows no bounds, and every extreme is used. Sometimes, one or two new products or out-of-season goods are marked at attractive prices to lure customers. Customers, unaware, flock to them like ducks. Once the cunning plan succeeds, the deception intensifies. When purchasing goods, they only seek cheap prices, regardless of quality. On the one hand, they deceive customers with inferior goods, gradually causing them to hate domestic silk and admire foreign goods. On the other hand, they prompt silk factories to cut corners and produce shoddy goods in order to meet the selling price. Observing the retail silk merchants in recent years, they only seek discounted goods to meet the needs of the so-called "great sacrifices and great auctions," resulting in low-grade fabrics dominating the market, while fine silk and satin are ignored. If this continues, who will be willing to engage in improving products? As the bad trend spreads, commercial ethics will be completely destroyed, and the reputation of national silk, which has lasted for thousands of years, will also be ruined in one fell swoop. It is already painful to speak of. Unexpectedly, it has recently become even more intensified, with real silk spun satin being sold at one foot or two feet for one fen. Huge advertisements are published in various newspapers, and special programs are broadcast on the radio, with clever and flattering words to sensationalize. It has been investigated that real silk spun satin has always been produced in Shaoxing and Shengze, with a long history and wide sales, reaching all corners of the world. The various territories in Southeast Asia are the main sales destinations. Because it is woven by hand with real silk, the quality is strong and durable, and the profit is extremely thin. Now, one or two retail merchants are using a small number of low-grade goods as a tool to attract customers, labeling them at 5.1 fen, causing various customer groups to seize on this as an excuse, and rumors are spread erroneously in overseas markets, causing doubts about the quality and cost of our country's spun satin, and even suspending procurement, which greatly impacts the national economy and people's livelihood. I recall that the "Diao Chan Crepe" produced by Lie Feng Silk Factory was used as a shouting item by a retail merchant and the price dropped again and again. The major dealers returned the goods, resulting in great losses to the factory. Even now, I still feel cold. However, these one or two Dou Shi merchants are intensifying their efforts, and recently, they have turned their attention to real silk spun satin, sparing no effort to destroy the hundreds of millions of rural workers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who depend on the family industry for their lives. They are determined to completely cut off the overseas sales of national silk, which is about to be cut off. Thinking of the future, pain and anger mix together. Therefore, we specially request your association to quickly take effective corrective actions in accordance with the association's general guidelines. At the same time, we also pray to convene a meeting to rectify industry regulations, and to formulate strict sanctions against those who destroy the association's goals and engage in actions that are close to destroying national silk, so as to save the decline and maintain national products. We await your urgent command.</p>

<p>Investigating the situation in the South China market</p>
<p>The inspection group organized by the business and industry circles of Yokohama, Japan, arrived in Shanghai last Tuesday. After investigating the Shanghai market for several days and staying for a week, the group of nine people, led by the group leader Shibata Tomoshige and the deputy group leader Suzuki Kotoshi, left Shanghai on the Nippon Yusen Kaisha Fushimi Maru yesterday afternoon for Hong Kong and then Guangzhou to investigate the situation in the South China market.

<h3 id="e132">International Tourist Group Travels on Shanghai-Beiping Through Train <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau previously telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to request instructions on how to calculate the fare for the American World Travel Group traveling on the Shanghai-Beiping through train. It was instructed by the Intermodal Transport Office on March 17 to follow the procedures in the ministry's deleted telegram of September 22. A copy of the deleted telegram was also provided, the original text of which is as follows: "The discounted sale of round-trip tourist tickets and domestic tourist tickets should be universally applied for business promotion purposes. As for Sino-Japanese intermodal transport tickets and international tourist group tickets, they are related to international matters and should also be universally applied to the Shanghai-Beiping intermodal through train. However, a special express surcharge must be paid in accordance with the regulations. In addition, international tourist groups wishing to take this through train must contact the relevant roads in advance, and Sino-Japanese intermodal transport groups are limited to the number of seats available on the train." It was immediately forwarded to the Traffic Department for compliance. The rickshaw pullers in the Special Zone, in order to oppose the Public Concession's Municipal Council's restrictions on rickshaw puller registration, which resulted in unemployed rickshaw pullers having no way to make a living, repeatedly decided to petition for negotiations, but no results were obtained. Therefore, a joint meeting of representatives was convened a few days ago, and it was resolved to: 1. Send another letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council for negotiations, 2. Recover the Mutual Aid Association for long-term registered rickshaw pullers and have the rickshaw pullers manage it themselves, 3. Telegraph the British Labour Party for assistance, etc. In addition, the Rickshaw Trade Association of the Special Zone, in order to oppose the reduction of rickshaw fares, in addition to holding a large meeting of rickshaw owners on the 27th, held a general meeting of all members at the association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., attended by more than 100 people, including Gu Songmao, Yin Zhifang, Wang Kunyi, Lu Dexin, Hou Wan'an, and Bao Zhenhuang. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Hegao, who first reported that the Municipal Council intended to reduce rickshaw fares starting from the first of next month, and then reported that Zheng Fazhu, the rickshaw puller who deflated the tires, had been released from prison and sued Gu Songmao, the deputy director of the association, in court, claiming that Gu had previously accused Zheng using the name of a dead person. However, it was investigated that Feng Yongyuan, Liu Shichang, etc., were all licensed persons who had obtained licenses from the Public Bureau, and were also members of the association. They had previously suffered losses from Zheng Fazhu's instigation of deflating tires and reported the losses to the association, and mutually elected Gu Songmao as the general representative to sue the court for compensation. However, the members have died over the years, and their family members have inherited their names without changing them, which is a normal occurrence and cannot be considered illegal. It was resolved that: 1. When the court summons them for trial, all members should appear in court and testify truthfully. 2. The proposal to oppose the rent reduction at the rickshaw owner's meeting on the 27th was passed. 3. The proposal to prepare and issue a manifesto at the general meeting was passed.</p>

<p>Temporarily replaced by Deputy Captain Wei Jizhong</p>
<p>Wu Xingbo, the captain of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, has made great efforts to maintain water security since taking office. It is said that Mr. Wu often went out on patrol in the middle of the night, which led to overwork and illness. He repeatedly asked Cai Jingjun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, to resign a month ago, but Director Cai did not approve it because water security is very important to the city's security. Recently, Captain Wu's illness has worsened and it is difficult for him to continue to serve in his demanding position. He again requested to resign a few days ago, and Director Cai, seeing that his illness was difficult to bear, temporarily approved it so that he could receive medical treatment. Meanwhile, Wei Jizhong, the deputy captain of the team, was appointed to temporarily serve as the captain of the team.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Ji Ren Zhu Cai Hui and Corpse <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Wu Linfang, a native of Songjiang, is 59 years old and used to be a small vendor. Recently, due to old age and unemployment, he and his wife, Mrs. Du (57 years old), rented a space in a two-story low attic at No. 43 Dongxin Lane, Maidi'an Road, French Concession, to live and beg for a living. Wu Linfang suddenly died of illness the day before yesterday (21st). Mrs. Du tried to find a coffin everywhere but could not, resulting in the body being left unburied for three days. The second landlord forced her to move the body to the alley entrance, but she refused. It was not until yesterday morning that the owner of Yicheng Coal Store found out and immediately reported it to Shao Ruxin, the chairman of the Ji Ren Zhu Cai Hui. He immediately sent investigator Hao Fusheng to investigate. He saw the body placed next to the ladder, with a bulging abdomen (due to being left unburied for three days). So he returned to the association and supervised the servants to carry a coffin worth 25 yuan, along with lime and charcoal ash, and carrying fees, etc., to collect the body and carry it to the Yimu Cemetery for burial. Also, Huang Dabao, a native of Changzhou (50 years old), who lived at No. 190 Gongyu Lane, Yangshupu Road, used to make a living as a small worker. Because he had no wife, he also died of illness the day before yesterday (21st). He had no coffin and was left unburied for three days. Yesterday, the Ji Ren Zhu Cai Hui found out and immediately sent servants to carry a coffin of the same type to collect and bury the body in the Yimu Cemetery. The economic depression of society can be seen from this.</p>

<p>The son of the French Consul in Shanghai left the French Consulate at No. 60 Huangpu Bund Road at about 6:00 a.m. yesterday to take a walk and planned to go for a ride in the suburbs. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped out the door, a small thief used an iron hook and rope to climb into his bedroom from the road, searching the room and stealing dozens of clothes worth more than 200 yuan and 30 yuan in banknotes. As he opened the door to escape, he was seen by the consulate's servant, who chased him and questioned him. The thief, feeling guilty, abandoned the clothes and ran wildly downstairs. But the servant still did not let go, chasing him all the way to the consulate's gate. The thief suddenly heard the pursuer calling for help and became more panicked. He immediately picked up a stone from the roadside and threw it at the servant, wounding him in the head and causing him to bleed profusely. The thief still managed to escape. The matter was reported to the police station afterwards, requesting them to pursue the arrest.</p>

<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Chongming in Yanjiajiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was murdered on the night of the 26th day of the tenth month of the old lunar calendar last year. His body was abandoned on the beach. After Li Fen, a prosecutor from the local court, arrived at the scene for an autopsy and ordered the body placed in a coffin, Chen Huangshi, the deceased's wife, showed no sign of grief. Therefore, the local police station detained her and sent her to the court for interrogation. Lu Zhiliang, the deceased's maternal uncle, was also implicated in the murder of Chen Hongfu, and subsequently,</p>
<p>Charged with Murder</p>
<p>The public prosecution was initiated. Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over several trials without a conclusion. Detailed information has been published in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the case was specially re-tried yesterday afternoon at 2 PM in the Third Court by Cai Dingsheng, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division. The defendant, Lu Zhiliang, hired two lawyers, Zhu Wenming and Zhu Hou'an, to appear in court for his defense. Judge Cai ordered Chen Huangshi and Lu Zhiliang, who were in custody, to be brought to the case. First, Chen Huangshi testified that she was 37 years old, a native of Chongming, and lived in Yanjiajiao. She had been with Chen Hongfu since she was 23 years old,</p>
<p>Without Being Married</p>
<p>They had six children together, three sons and one daughter surviving. The eldest son, Genxiang, is eleven years old; the second son, Yuxiang, is eight years old; the daughter, Xuezhen, is six years old; and the fourth son, Xuexiang, is three years old. She had no involvement in the death of her husband and was truly wronged. Asked, "You said in the Public Security Bureau that your husband stole things and was beaten to death. Is that true?" She replied, "My husband refused to do household chores and was very unruly. Because there were many children in the family, perhaps he was</p>
<p>Murdered by Someone."</p>
<p>Asked, "Why didn't you provide this information when Judge Wu opened the court?" She replied, "It concerns my reputation, so I didn't." Lu Zhiliang testified that he was 58 years old, a native of Chongming, and worked at the power company. Chen Hongfu was his nephew. When his parents died, Hongfu was only thirteen years old. He provided relief to him until he became an adult and also rented eight mu of farmland to him for cultivation. From the 21st to the 23rd year of the Republic, he owed him three years of rent. Although he and Hongfu were uncle and nephew, their relationship was like father and son. He did not know who murdered Hongfu and knew nothing about it. Pointing at him</p>
<p>As an Accomplice</p>
<p>Is truly an unexcusable injustice. He pleaded for investigation. The official ordered Chen Xuezhen to be brought to the case. The deceased's brother, Chen Qiufu, carried Xuezhen to the court. He asked about her age, etc. Xuezhen remained silent and no testimony could be obtained. Next, children Chen Genxiang and Chen Jinxiang testified. Then, witness Yang Xiazi testified that Xuezhen came to my house to play. I asked her if she was upset that her father had died. Xuezhen said she was upset, and she did not mention any</p>
<p>Murder.</p>
<p>Witness Zhang Qinglang testified that Chen Hongfu was murdered by Chen Huangshi and others, according to Yang Xiazi. The local guarantor Gao Linquan testified about the situation after reporting the incident for investigation. Finally, police officer Zhou testified in court, providing detailed accounts of the various situations he was ordered to investigate earlier. At this point, prosecutor Li Fen gave his argument in court. The official instructed to begin the debate. Lawyers Zhu and Zhu rose to defend in succession, briefly stating that both defendants</p>
<p>Were Falsely Accused</p>
<p>Requesting a new investigation and declaring them not guilty. Lu Zhiliang further testified that after the incident, Gao Linquan came to his house intending to extort money, claiming that according to Zhang Qinglang and others, Chen Hongfu's death was due to him hiring someone to commit the murder. He urged him to ask an old friend to negotiate. Because he had not committed a crime, he politely refused. This despicable trick was clearly Zhang Qinglang fabricating rumors and framing him. He asked Cai, the presiding judge, to inquire with Gao Linquan</p>
<p>What was his Intention?</p>
<p>Gao replied that because he knew Lu Zhiliang, he went to inquire whether such a thing had happened, with no other intention. Judge Cai pondered for a moment and ordered Chen Huangshi to be brought to the case, saying, "Now Xuezhen is temporarily handed over to you to take to the detention center and raise for a few days." Chen replied that she only received two bowls of millet porridge a day in the center, which was not enough to fill her stomach. The child was not given food, so her three-year-old boy,</p>
<p>Was Dying</p>
<p>The child could walk before being detained. Since being detained, the child has been wasting away daily and is now exhausted and unable to stand. At this point in the testimony, the child's legs were exposed, and the court asked to review the situation. Chen also said that she could not feed one child enough, let alone two. Judge Cai had compassion and ordered the detention center to increase the food rations. Because there was still a need for investigation in this case, he would continue the trial later. The two defendants were returned to custody. By the time the court adjourned, it was already dusk.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Communications Bank Handles Agricultural Loans with Success; Over 90% of Loans Granted Last Year Have Been Repaid; This Year, It is Decided to Handle Cotton Planting in Shaanxi and Shanxi, and Tea Planting in Anhui <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since expanding its capital, the Communications Bank has dedicated itself to providing agricultural loans. Last year's credit cooperative loan program in Shaanxi Province was very successful. This year, in response to requests from Qimen tea farmers, it will also handle special production and sales loans. The loan situation is explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Planting Loans in Shaanxi Province: The bank's agricultural cooperative loans are based on cooperatives, mutual aid societies, cooperative preparatory societies, and agricultural warehouses as loan-granting institutions. Last year, loans were first handled in five counties in Shaanxi Province: Dali, Chaoyi, Wugong, Xingping, and Xianyang. Because there was a lack of formal cooperative organizations in the area, credit cooperative preparatory societies were targeted. A total of 80,000 yuan was loaned, which was due in February of this year. Over 90% has been repaid, which is a very good result. The interest rate is a uniform monthly rate of 8%, which greatly benefits farmers. There are now more than 500 formally established cooperatives in these counties. This year, it is decided to loan 200,000 yuan for cotton planting production and sales in Shaanxi Province and, after consultation with the Shanxi Province Cotton Planting Guidance Institute, to simultaneously handle cotton planting loans of 200,000 yuan in Shanxi Province, centered on Yuncheng, including four counties in the area.</p>
<p>Qimen Tea Loans: To promote the recovery of tea trade and improve the economic situation of tea farmers, the bank will conduct short-term tea production and sales cooperative loans in Qimen this year on a trial basis. It is limited to well-organized cooperatives under the guidance of the Qimen Tea Improvement Institute, jointly organized by the Anhui Provincial Government, the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Industry. The total amount is set at 500,000 yuan, and the interest rate is a monthly rate of 8%. An office has now been established in Qimen, and tea merchants have also requested loans from the bank for relief, which is currently under discussion. The total amount is 1.1 million yuan, and the loan method will be handled according to ordinary commercial loans.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Municipal Shanghai Hospital Reconstruction: Demolition of Part of the Buildings Has Commenced <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Shanghai Hospital on Duojia Road in the Nanshi District was transferred to municipal management, it has been reorganized and improved, with a completely new look due to the unification of authority. Unfortunately, the original buildings were old and dilapidated. Mayor Wu personally visited and recognized the necessity of reconstruction, and funds were allocated for the reconstruction. The Health and Public Works Bureaus jointly designed and bid for the project. At the time of commencement, Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an had just returned from a study tour of Europe and the United States, and all planning became more perfect. Efforts were made to make the construction of the buildings and the internal equipment suitable for the modern era. Once the new buildings are completed, the scale will be impressive, and the benefit to local citizens will be significant. It is heard that the hospital has now begun demolishing part of the buildings in the back area. However, in terms of outpatient services, in addition to the restrictions due to the building conditions that only allow for the admission of patients who must be hospitalized, other outpatient services are still proceeding as usual and are not interrupted.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Wang Binyan Suffers Due to Public Service: Private Property Sealed Yesterday; Due to the Principal and Interest of the Jiazi Military Advance Payment Exceeding 80,000 Yuan; Local Gentry Decide to Continue Requesting Relief from the Government <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Wang Binyan, the head of the Zhabei Security Corps, previously used his residence on Meiyuan Road in Zhabei as collateral for an advance payment for the Jiazi military, borrowing from Cunde Qianzhuang, Hong Kong National Bank, Guangdong Bank, etc. To date, the principal and interest have reached 84,000 yuan. After the creditors filed a petition to the court for recovery without success, the local court sent personnel to seal the property yesterday morning. Wang suffered due to public service, and the local gentry have repeatedly petitioned the government for relief. Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Chen Aishi, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Shen Lianfang also jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government for relief. Later, Chairman Chen of Jiangsu forwarded the matter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting allocation of funds. The original dispatch stated that the telegrams from Yu Qiaqing, Du Yong, Wang Zhen, Chen Qicai, etc., stated that during the Su-Zhe War in the Republic of China's 13th year, the Zhabei Charity Group advanced more than 220,000 yuan, and at that time, the Jiangsu Provincial Military and Civilian Chief and the Finance Department co-signed a contract, using all the property of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau to repay the debt. The contract was copied and sent by the former Jiangsu Provincial Military Chief to the former Army and Finance Departments for reference. This advance payment was, in terms of its nature, for the use of the national army in wartime, and the contract stated that it would be repaid with national property, and it was reported to the Ministry for record. It should belong to the central government. In terms of facts, the head of the group, Wang Dong, suffered due to public service for more than ten years, and it is not appropriate to ignore it. If the financial resources of Jiangsu Province were sufficient, the provincial treasury could clear the debt without distinguishing between regions. However, the finances of Jiangsu Province in recent years have been extremely difficult, as your Ministry is well aware, and it is truly unable to do so. Now, according to the telegram requesting the return of 84,000 yuan to clear Wang Dong's private property mortgage, the circumstances are very urgent. In addition to replying by telegram, the photographs of the original contract are enclosed for your Ministry to verify and allocate funds. The nature and burden of the debt are very clearly analyzed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Now that Wang's residence has been sealed, the public is extremely indignant, so it is decided to continue to request relief from the government.</p>

<p>Han Yiying, a woman from Changzhou, is currently twenty years old and studied at the Huiqun Women's Middle School. In the Republic of China's 22nd year, while Han was studying at the school, she was pursued by Cui Yaochen (currently twenty-eight years old), a pattern maker from Chang'an. On August 14th of that year, they had a relationship in the Dong'an Hotel on Zhejiang Road, and Cui immediately asked someone to act as a matchmaker. With the permission of Han's family, they were married on March 24th of the 24th year at the Hangzhou Restaurant and lived together at 7 Yuanhefang, Wuzhou Road. Unexpectedly, not long after the marriage, their feelings suddenly changed, and they beat each other many times. On January 13th of this year, Cui forced Han to borrow money from his mother in Room 29 of the Wuzhou Hotel on Wuzhou Road. Then, on the morning of February 19th at 11 AM, Cui, along with several others, went to his mother-in-law's house and brutally beat his mother-in-law, causing injuries. She sued in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, and Judge Zhan sentenced Cui to a fine of thirty yuan. Han's mother believed that Cui's behavior was so violent that she could no longer live with him, so she hired lawyer Yu Congdao to file a complaint in the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from Cui, payment of alimony of 2,500 yuan, and the return of all dowry, totaling 1,336 yuan. The Special Court approved the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cao Jun summoned the parties in Civil Court 12. Cui hired lawyer Lu Dingming to appear in court, stating that the case should be suspended. The reason was that the case of injuring the mother-in-law had been appealed and had not yet been determined, so it could not be used as evidence immediately. The plaintiff's claim of abuse was not true. The plaintiff stated in the mediation court that if she separated from her parents-in-law, she could continue to live together, and there was a possibility of reconciliation in this case. Therefore, in accordance with Article 182, paragraph 1, and Articles 183 and 574 of the Civil Procedure Law, he requested a suspension. The plaintiff's lawyer, Yu, stated that the suspension of the lawsuit required the consent of both parties. If they wanted to reconcile, it could also be done during the litigation. Judge Cao instructed that the case be rescheduled, and the decision on the suspension would be made later.</p>

<h3 id="e148">The Public Security and Health Bureaus are Planning to Establish a Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Hospital <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Negotiating to Borrow Memorial Buildings in Gaojingmiao for Use; Compiling Regular and Start-up Expenses and Submitting for Appropriation</p>
<p>The Public Security and Health Bureaus of this city, in order to forcibly rehabilitate drug users in the city, have now reached the second phase of registration, and the number of arrested drug offenders is increasing daily. All the existing drug rehabilitation hospitals are unable to accommodate them. With the approval of the municipal government, the two bureaus are jointly planning to establish a temporary drug rehabilitation hospital that can accommodate 500 people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiating to Borrow Buildings for Renovation and Preparation</p>
<p>There are more than 4,000 drug users in this city who have voluntarily requested drug rehabilitation from the Public Security Bureau. In addition to the more than 1,730 who have already been sent for rehabilitation, there are more than 2,000 waiting to be sent for treatment. In addition to the 50 beds already added by the Municipal Health Bureau at the Shanghai North Drug Rehabilitation Hospital with existing funds, it is also planned to establish a temporary drug rehabilitation hospital with 500 beds to meet urgent needs. However, it is difficult to find suitable buildings for a hospital with 500 beds in a short period of time. After joint discussion by the Public Security and Health Bureaus, only the memorial village buildings in Gaojingmiao in this city can be renovated and used. According to preliminary estimates, the renovation project will require 5,830 yuan, and the water and electricity connection fees will be 3,300 yuan. However, the memorial village buildings are the property of the Shanghai Local Association, and it is planned to borrow them for a short period of time. It is necessary to first discuss with the Local Association and consult with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to temporarily transfer and borrow a portion of the buildings that had been borrowed from the association. Once the hospital is closed, they will be returned. The duration of the temporary hospital is estimated to be three to four months, according to the number of drug users registered with the Public Security Bureau, before it can be completely closed.</p>
<p>Operating Expenses: Minimizing Costs;</p>
<p>In order to save expenses for the establishment of the temporary drug rehabilitation hospital, the necessary funds are used for the application. Therefore, the purchase cost is only over 20,000 yuan. Also, medical equipment and supplies will be transferred as much as possible. The total start-up cost is only slightly more than 21,000 yuan, which is sufficient. However, the location is remote, and security must be taken seriously. A squad of police officers can be allocated by the Public Security Bureau to be stationed there permanently to ensure safety. It is also planned to urge those undergoing rehabilitation to engage in light gardening work to exercise and benefit their physical and mental health. Therefore, the total estimated monthly operating expenses are slightly more than 11,400 yuan. The required expenses have been compiled into a detailed budget by the two bureaus and submitted to the municipal government for appropriation in order to complete the preparations within the month and facilitate drug rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Two Prostitutes Unwilling to Continue in the Flesh Trade</p>
<p>The Case Occurred in Jiangwan and Was Transferred to the Local Court</p>
<p>Bao Guihong, a woman from Huzhou, is currently twenty-eight years old, and Chen Cuihong, a woman from Anhui, is currently twenty-five years old. Four years ago, their parents arranged to bring them from their hometown to Shanghai and sold them to the brothel opened by pimp Wan in Ruifuli, 46 Xizilaihuo Street, French Concession. Bao's price was 220 yuan, and Chen's was 200 yuan. From then on, both women fell into the pit of prostitution. Every time the lights came on, they went out with maids to receive guests. For four years, they suffered greatly. Half a month ago, the two women, unwilling to continue in the flesh trade, ran away together, escaped from their cage, and hid in Jiangwan Town. However, after the two women fled privately, pimp Wan entrusted people to search for them everywhere. At 11 AM the day before yesterday, someone reported that the two women were hiding in Jiangwan. She immediately sent Jin Guohua and others from Yangzhou to hire a car to Jiangwan. They happened to see the two women shopping on the way and immediately used violent means to force them into the car, intending to take them back to the brothel to resume their old profession. Unexpectedly, while passing the intersection of Haining Road and North Zhejiang Road, the two women took the opportunity to jump out of the car and ran away. Jin Guohua also got out of the car and chased after them. At this time, Hua police officer number 2688 happened to see this and brought the two women and Jin into the police station. After questioning by the police chief, he learned the details. He ordered the two women to be sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary custody and Jin to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the above situation, saying that the incident occurred in Jiangwan. For convenience, he requested that the case be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Judge Wu Zehan briefly questioned Chen, Bao, and Jin Guohua, ordering Jin to be detained pending transfer to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, and Chen Cuihong and Bao Guihong to be transferred together.</p>

Its long history is second to none in the sea and can be praised as the leader of the woolen fabric industry. In recent years, due to the decline of people's livelihood and weak purchasing power, business has been depressed to the extreme. In order to meet social needs, the store has specially reorganized all its goods over two months and will hold a large overstock auction starting on the 26th of this month. It is heard that there are hundreds of thousands of woolen fabrics in stock, starting from 19 cents per foot, and thousands of dozens of woolen hats, starting from 35 cents per hat. They only seek to clear the goods regardless of the capital, so that citizens can reduce their economic burden. It is truly a good opportunity to solve the spring clothing problem.</p>

<p>Publishing World: "Panorama of Food" Eating and drinking are one of the four major elements of life and have a very close relationship with human survival. Therefore, how to select materials, how to cook reasonably, how to match dishes, and how to manufacture food are all worth studying. Although there are some food books published in the publishing world, they are either fragmented, limited to one aspect, or falsely emphasize theory and are not practical. In view of this, young author Yan Yi Jun has compiled "Panorama of Food" based on his food knowledge and experience gained over the past ten years. The content is comprehensive, the materials are practical and useful, and the book covers the two words "eating and drinking." The text is 150,000 words long and forms a thick volume. The printing is exquisite and sells for only 40 cents. It is published by the China Publishing House, 4 Lane 153, 153 Kader Road, Shanghai, and distributed by the Shanghai Magazine Company. New housewives and food entrepreneurs should have a copy on hand.</p>

<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Survey Group Report (6)  From Wuzhou   National Goods Communication</p>
<p>After we arrived in Wuzhou, we immediately toured the city streets. The displays in the shops were indeed mostly national goods, all transported from Guangdong. There were some foreign goods, but only a few. We spoke with Mr. Ma Junwu, the president of Guangxi University. Mr. Ma said that promoting national goods is an essential plan to save the country. The province's self-sufficiency policy is not about Guangxi people using Guangxi goods, but about Guangxi people using national goods from all over the country. In fact, for all businesses run by Chinese people, with Chinese capital, Chinese raw materials, and Chinese workers, their products are naturally popular with everyone. We Guangxi people dare not boast about anything else, but our habit of using national goods is innate. When I went to Shanghai last month, I saw all the goods I needed in terms of materials, and I was very happy. In the future, I can shop without having to seek outside help. Guangxi University has 800 students and is willing to follow you in promoting and advocating this work to save the declining economy. Even local officials and the people are willing to promote it. Regardless of gender or age, everyone is organizing together to work on using national goods. At that time, Chief Huang of the Finance Department and County Magistrate Cai were present, and they all agreed with Dr. Ma's proposal. During the meeting, the atmosphere for using national goods became very strong. Because of the enthusiasm of the Guangxi people's patriotism, promoting national goods is more joyful than in other provinces. We would very much like to seek an opportunity for cooperation with the industrial and commercial leaders of Guangxi Province. Then the development of Guangxi's industry will be limitless, and the promotion of national goods will be even easier.</p>

<p>— Edited by China Credit Bureau</p>
<p>The grain industry in this city has a wide variety of types. It can be broadly divided into manufacturing and sales industries. Among the manufacturing industries, it can be further divided into flour, wheat bran, and oilseed cake industries due to the different types of goods. In the sales industry, in addition to the classification of goods, there are also differences between brokerage firms and retailers. Furthermore, due to the differences in regions, it can be divided into foreign merchants and Chinese merchants, local merchants and guest merchants. Therefore, the organizational structure of grain merchants in Shanghai is also unusually complex, and often cannot be understood by outsiders. Based on the survey, I will briefly describe the three categories of rice industry, flour and bran industry, and miscellaneous grains and oilseed cake industry.</p>

Even among all the industry associations in the city, there is none that predates it. The bean industry was most prosperous in the mid-Qing Dynasty. The commonly used "98-regulation yuan" in Shanghai was created by them, so it is also called Dou Gui Yuan. However, in recent years, it has gradually declined, but it still has the right to use its own notes, and its receipts and expenditures circulate in the market. Its credit is still very good to this day. The types of business are soybeans, soybean oil, soybean cake, miscellaneous grains, rice, etc., with oilseed cake as the main product, so it is also called the oilseed cake industry. The source of goods is mostly from Guandong and coastal areas of Shandong. This industry is often related to the rice industry, so it is also called the bean and rice industry. In the past, both industries applied to the Shanghai County for transfer of licensing post-its, belonging to the Amaranth rice industry category among the brokerage types.</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Rengu Hall's association also has a long history, but it is later than Cuixiu Hall. It was differentiated from the bean and rice industry, so since the past until now, both parties have cooperated and proceeded consistently in all matters. The persons in charge of the two industries have always been concurrently held by one person. Formerly called directors, now called chairman, the current chairman is Mr. Gu Xinyi. In the last two or three decades, the business of the rice industry has gradually developed, while the bean industry has shrunk. The reason for this is that the bean industry is limited to the local oilseed cake, while the rice industry includes not only Heshadou rice, guest rice, and foreign rice, but also other fancy miscellaneous grains. Even with just the Heshadou rice category, the annual business is considerable due to the large population and huge consumption volume in Shanghai. The business is different, which leads to this.</p>
<p>After 1929, the bean and rice industry associations merged into one and formed the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild. The general office is located at the Cuixiu Hall in Yuyuan Garden, and north and south market branch offices are set up at the original Rengu Hall and Zhabei. There are many branch organizations affiliated to the association, which are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Nanshi Bean and Rice Industry Rice Group Rice Distribution Sub-Association. Originally named Nanshi Rice</p>
<p>Industry Association, it is organized by merchants specializing in rice and grain south of the Sixteen PUs in Shanghai South, commonly known as rice distributors. The association is located in the original Rengu Hall address on Zhonghua Road outside Dadongmen. The current director is Mr. Zhu Zixiang.</p>
<p>2.  Beishi Bean and Rice Industry Rice Group Rice Distribution Sub-Association. Originally named Beishi Rice Industry Association, it is organized by merchants specializing in rice and grain north of the Suzhou River in Shanghai North and in various parts of Shanghai West. The north end of Xinzha Bridge is the gathering place for rice shops. At its peak two years ago, there were as many as thirty-six, and they all focused on rice as their main business. Merchants and resellers from various places and producing areas also gathered here. The prosperity of Beishi commerce is due to the association's efforts. However, in the past two years, due to the impact of the war, it has declined slightly. The association is located at the intersection of Guangfu Road and Changan Road in Zhabei. The current director is Mr. Guan Zisheng.</p>
<p>3.  Bean and Rice Industry Public Weighing Office. Formerly known as Renhetang Public Weighing Office, it was renamed to its current name after the merger of the bean and rice industries. It is organized by merchants specializing in bagged rice and miscellaneous grains in the rice industry, and some merchants who are not members of the Rice Industry Association also participate. The office provides public scales and issues public sampling receipts. The address is attached to the original site of Rentang.</p>
<p>4.  Husi Workers' Union. Organized by the Husi of the rice industry. Husi is a rice measuring worker, and their position is very important. Traders consider it more important than apprentices. Below them are tea servants for use. There are hundreds of people in the city. In the past, they were very scattered and not united. After the rice</p>
<p>weighing fairness movement occurred, they suddenly organized and established it. It has not been a year since its founding. The association is located at No. in Yucheng East Lane, Mazhen Road, Zhabei. The current chairman is Mr. Liu Longxiang.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned groups, there are many other public welfare groups that are organized independently by the rice industry or jointly by the bean and rice industries: such as schools, guilds, and relief funds. Branch institutions have been established one after another. In recent years, warehouses, hospitals, and docks have also been planned. Except for the rice dock, which was established early, and the warehouse, which was completed in 1934, and Mr. Zhang Shengru, the former manager of Dachang Rice Shop, was elected as the director of the warehouse by the guild, other projects are still pending due to the turbulent situation and funding difficulties.</p>
<p>2.  Shanghai Rice Milling Industry Association. This association was officially established on February 21, 1918, at the Rengu Hall of the Rice Industry Association. At that time, it was named Shanghai Machine Rice Milling Association. Membership is not limited by the size of the organization, but only those who operate machine rice milling in Shanghai can join, using the president system. However, it is now renamed the Shanghai Rice Milling Industry Association, and the president system has also been changed to the chairman. The internal organizations are modeled after the Rice Industry Association. Therefore, most of the internal administrators are also rice merchants. The current chairman is Mr. Zhu Zixiang, the owner of Xinchang Rice Mill. The association is located at No. 212, Kulun Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>There are about fifty rice mills in the city recently. Although the larger ones have joined the association early, many of those not yet joined also want to join. Their business mostly involves rice business and self-milling; only a few specialize in milling rice for customers. In addition, there are special ones with business connections, who specialize in milling Ke Lu rice, etc. Among them, Xinchang has the most capital, with eight rice machines, followed by Zhenxing and Heji, etc. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e160">The Relationship Between Cotton Cloth and the Rural Economy <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoshi</p>
<p>There are three main types of cotton cloth: one is machine-made, one is made with new-style machines, and the third is produced by farmhouses. Machine-made and new-style machine-made cotton cloth use completely machine-spun yarn. Farmhouse products are generally half-machine-spun yarn and half-self-spun yarn. These three types of cotton cloth are all essential clothing materials for people's daily life. If everyone can use domestically produced cotton cloth, the rural economy will flourish. China is an agricultural country, and farming and weaving have always been equally important. The so-called "men farm and women weave" is the principle of farm household production. In the rural areas of the interior, there is still a common custom: when a daughter gets married, regardless of wealth, they must make several pieces of cloth clothing, several cloth quilts, and several bolts of cotton cloth. More is considered better. There is a local saying, "Passed down from grandma to mother to daughter," which is considered a good thing. The importance farmers attach to cotton cloth is evident here.</p>
<p>The Xugong Bridge held a farm household economic survey. The entire area had 720 households, 3,536 people, 1,042 spinning machines, and 481 weaving machines. The annual cotton cloth production was 9,387 bolts, worth 9,387 yuan. A recent survey in the improved area of the Shanghai suburbs showed that the entire area had 944 households, 4,904 people, and 862 weaving women. The annual income from cotton cloth was worth 6,750 yuan. According to these two statistics, weaving is indeed the profession of rural women. Although the price of cloth is low and there is no profit to be made, the women in the village are still tirelessly engaged in spinning and weaving. How should we protect and advocate this to maintain her precarious livelihood?</p>
<p>In the past, when I traveled to Jiangyin, the sound of weaving machines was constant in the streets and alleys. Many old weaving machines were dozens, or even hundreds, of them. Few had one or two, or three or four. In addition to women, there were also a large number of men who were weavers. From this, it can be seen that in the rural areas of the interior, not only do women rely on weaving as a career, but there are also many men who use weaving as a career. In Shanghai's Dongjiadu, there are those who specialize in making old-style shuttles, and their business is very good. Small vendors sell them wholesale to various villages. In the Pudong area, women who use weaving as a sideline still account for eight or nine out of ten. Sanlintang native cloth is very famous at the time. I mention these examples to tell everyone the importance of the position that cotton cloth occupies in the countryside. I hope everyone will love and use domestically produced cotton cloth to maintain rural life.</p>
<p>Recently, a friend from Zhenping specifically purchased foot-powered spinning wheels that use artificial spinning in Pudong, because the foot-powered wheels in Pudong can spin three yarns at the same time, unlike the hand-powered spinning wheels in the Suzhou and Wuxi areas, which can only spin one yarn at a time. This friend said that women in the interior who engage in spinning and weaving can support their own minimum living expenses. It can be seen that it is not only necessary to maintain the current state of rural weaving, but also necessary to vigorously promote it. However, the prosperity or decline of industry depends on the sales situation. If patriotic compatriots in various places pay attention to the rural cotton cloth issue and are happy to use domestically produced cotton cloth, the rural economy will flourish. Therefore, my conclusion is, "Use one more bolt of domestically produced cotton cloth, and you can help the livelihood of one more commoner."</p>
<h3 id="e161">How to Maintain a Trade Surplus <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>Since the establishment of customs in my country, there have only been huge trade deficit figures on the books every year, but never a single cent of trade surplus. As a result, even the enthusiastic people who originally shouted loudly to promote national goods often became discouraged and retreated due to the lack of results. As a result, the national goods movement became increasingly scattered, and at the same time, the ridicule that the Chinese people received for their five-minute heat has been more than once.</p>
<p>In recent years, people with foresight in my country have realized the importance of economic salvation, so they have proportionally intensified their efforts to promote national goods. Although women's national goods year and students' national goods year did not have significant results, they did not retreat and did not fall into the old trap of five-minute heat. After all, they were victorious. According to reports, the total import volume of Shanghai's foreign trade in December last year was 36,849,949 yuan, and the total export value was 37,932,566 yuan. The trade surplus was 1,082,617 yuan. This is truly the first time since the establishment of customs. Undoubtedly, this is a page of our honor, a harvest of the efforts of those who are enthusiastic about the country's destiny!</p>
<p>However, a month's trade surplus is difficult to compensate for eleven months' trade deficit. Therefore, our only responsibility now is to make further determination and efforts to ensure that the records of each month are trade surpluses, and that the country is permanently transformed from a trade deficit country to a trade surplus country. That is our final success!</p>
<p>To be honest, Chinese goods now have made amazing progress compared to the past. Therefore, the sudden reversal to trade surplus on the customs books in December, although it is said to be the awakening of people's hearts and a deepening expression of national concept, it is also not because there have been considerable substitutes supplied! Therefore, if we want to maintain the trade surplus figure permanently, on the one hand, we must encourage the people to use national goods, and on the other hand, we must also encourage industry, so that Chinese goods can surpass foreign goods. Then the people will also be happy to use national goods. It is not difficult for my country, which has always been in a trade deficit, to transform into a trade surplus country forever!</p>
<p>Finally, the author believes that the national crisis is extremely serious now. Born in a special environment, my country cannot even talk about using force to relieve the national crisis. Therefore, only promoting national goods does not need to be unreasonably interfered with and hindered by external forces. As long as everyone can implement it, it will surely kill the enemy. Compatriots, this is the only way out for our entire nation at present. Let's all get up and work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e162">Promoting Local Goods and Promoting National Goods <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Yingfu</p>
<p>Promoting local goods to cultivate the rural economy is indeed the current practical preparation for saving the country. The meaning is so important.</p>
<p>Modern gentlemen such as Tai Shuangqiu and others have therefore initiated a "Local Goods Year" and set a ten-year plan to mobilize the public to promote it together. According to the estimates of these gentlemen, just promoting hand-spun and hand-woven local cloth in the countryside alone, allowing 300 million farmers to engage in this during the five months of slack farming time, even if they earn two cents a day, the annual income will reach 900 million yuan. This shows the importance of promoting local goods in this extraordinary period.</p>
<p>Promoting local goods and promoting national goods can be said to be the left and right wings of the movement to revive the national economy, moving towards a common goal. However, promoting local goods is more strict and easier to achieve practical results than promoting national goods. The reason is: today's so-called national goods (referring to machine-made foreign-style goods), because they are imitated foreign goods, are difficult to distinguish from imported goods. This creates difficulties in identification. At the same time, from the perspective of raw materials, the so-called national goods often have foreign components mixed in. Local goods have fewer of these drawbacks.</p>
<p>Therefore, I also feel that the sentences pointed out in the declaration of the Local Goods Implementation Committee are worthy of our attention:</p>
<p>"We firmly advocate promoting local goods for self-use in the countryside, and promoting urban residents to purchase local goods. We hope that local goods will come to the city, and we do not hope that national goods will go to the countryside. We hope that entrepreneurs will go to the countryside to develop cooperative rural production, and do not absorb rural money into the city to open factories, causing rural financial exhaustion."</p>
<h3 id="e163">Contribution to My Country's Paper Umbrella Industry <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Baoyue</p>
<p>Although the manufacturing method of paper umbrellas in our country is very old, it is still quite practical today. In the past, paper umbrellas were an indispensable rain gear for everyone in our country. Since the import of the foreign product "foreign umbrella," people in general have gradually regarded it as an outdated product because of their preference for foreignization, which has greatly hit the paper umbrella industry.</p>
<p>Among the national products that sell well in Nanyang, paper umbrellas are also one of the major ones. The reason why the natives of Nanyang are happy to use paper umbrellas in our country is certainly not only for economic reasons, and they are also suitable for sunshade and rain protection. As a result, paper umbrellas are still selling well in Nanyang today, and they still feel that they are needed.</p>
<p>Although there have been Japanese-made umbrellas imported into Nanyang in recent years, they are not as durable as paper umbrellas made in our country, so the impact on the sales of paper umbrellas in Nanyang is still slight. However, the modern Nanyang natives are no longer as ignorant as they used to be. Because of the invasion of the tide of world material civilization, their minds are gradually becoming new, their knowledge is gradually increasing, and all industries have made considerable progress. Seeing that paper umbrellas can sell well in the market and are profitable, they have set up their own umbrella-making factories. Naturally, in the future, the sales of paper umbrellas in Nanyang in our country will inevitably suffer a major blow.</p>
<p>The Nanyang Sanbaolong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the consulates stationed in Hezhou, and the Batavia Chinese Merchants Grocery Association have all sent letters to our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that our country's umbrella-making industry pay attention to the worrying future of sales in Nanyang in order to seek improvement and competition. The paper umbrellas shipped to Nanyang for sale are all produced in Wenzhou. Judging from the recent situation of the export of Wenzhou umbrellas gradually decreasing compared to the past, the future is indeed worrying. Of course, we should try to remedy it before it is severely affected, so that it is not difficult to restore the original market situation. However, most of the umbrella-making workers in our country only know how to stick to the old methods and rarely have the ability to research and improve. Now, for the sake of their future lives, they will naturally be very willing and hope that the outside world will contribute opinions.</p>
<p>I think what umbrella-making workers should pay attention to at least is how to reduce costs and strive for beauty. In addition, in terms of materials, domestically produced cotton paper should be used for manufacturing, because it is more durable than foreign kraft paper. Autumn and winter bamboo should be used for bamboo ribs to avoid the occurrence of wormwood. Raw oil has glutinous properties and is easy to break. Use high-quality tung oil. In terms of manufacturing, the toothed wood attached to the umbrella ribs and the tied yarn should be improved. It should be dried in the shade after brushing the oil. Unfinished paper umbrellas should not be packed in boxes. Regarding these points, I hope that my country's paper umbrella industry will refer to them, which are all practical for the improvement of work.</p>

<p>Dear Editor: I have a few suggestions for national goods and daily necessities. Please publish them as follows:</p>
<p>Thermos Bottle: It is now sold in poor rural areas, and users find it convenient, but the long form often makes people afraid that it will fall over and break into pieces on the table. This sentence can express the psychology of ordinary users. It is best to ask the manufacturer to improve it, just "weld a round piece of lead inside the bottom of the bottle shell", then it can be placed securely. As for the problem of water leakage from the bottle mouth, the Enthusiastic brand bottle has been improved, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>Celluloid Products: The products of Da Zhonghua are the most famous, but unfortunately, they are mostly children's toys (the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, how many people buy them?). Also, like the pocket memo pads made of celluloid in Japan, no one simply thinks of imitating them. This kind of pad is only three inches square. You can write words on it with a pencil, and then you can erase it with a rubber to use it forever. You can write down in advance what you want to do at home or before going out. It is also very convenient to take out from your pocket if you have something to write down temporarily. If you engrave "Happy New Year", you can also congratulate the New Year. If you send it to a friend, the recipient can also use it for other purposes. I hope the manufacturers will imitate it, but it is profitable.</p>
<p>Enameled Products: The exquisiteness of domestically produced products in recent years is enough to rival foreign products, and there are many types. Only the pots used for cooking at home have not been made. According to foreign products, there is a kind of enamel pot. It is the same shape as the Chinese iron pot, but because it is double-layered, the outside is enamel, and it will not be burnt after a long time, and it is not afraid of coal fire that easily burns pots and kettles. I hope the manufacturers will manufacture it to save the economic welfare of each family in my country, which has the largest consumption. I wish you peace. Luo Shuyi</p>

Li Huitang was changed to the left auxiliary. After Zhang scored a goal in the early morning, the momentum was not good. In the second half, Zhang and Li switched positions, but it was still ineffective. Instead, the Navy scored two goals. As a result, the Navy won 2 to 1.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Survey of Schools: Overview of Shanghai American School <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>There are quite a few schools established in Shanghai, especially those established by foreign nationals. In recent years, educators from various parts of the country who come to Shanghai to visit education facilities often want to see the overall facilities of foreign schools, in order to learn from them. However, due to language and time constraints, they often cannot get a complete picture. Now, we are introducing an overview of Shanghai American School as a reference for educators. Overviews of schools established by nationals of other countries in Shanghai will be published successively later. The author would like to thank Dr. Wells, the principal of Shanghai American School, for providing materials and for donating a bird's-eye view of the school building. (Editor's note)</p>
<p>1.  The largest American school in China</p>
<p>Shanghai American School is the largest American school in China established by American expatriates for their children. American expatriates from all provinces in China send their children to the school. Most of the students come from American expatriates living in Shanghai, but there are also students from Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hainan, Shandong, Hong Kong, Yunnan, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Manchuria.</p>
<p>The school was established on September 17, 1912. It was initially organized by a group of parents from the staff of three American churches and the YMCA in China. At that time, a board of directors was established in New York to oversee all school affairs. The school's purpose was to educate American children in an American school by American teachers using American ideals and traditional concepts, so as to cultivate them into the most useful American citizens. The school's organization includes a complete elementary school and a two-level secondary school.</p>
<p>The school was quite small when it was founded. It rented a house on North Sichuan Road as a school building. In the first semester, there were only 38 students. In September 1923, the school moved to its current location, 10 Avenue Petain in the French Concession. The new school building has a large site, covering approximately 938 mu. Therefore, the number of students, school buildings, and equipment have all developed greatly over the years. Initially, most of the children enrolled came from church and business families in China. Therefore, an executive department was established in Shanghai in 1921, jointly maintained by an equal number of representatives elected by churches and businesses in China, while a permanent board of directors was established in New York to manage all school affairs. The members of the board of directors and the executive department are all elected from related groups, and are partially re-elected annually.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Ample New Yarn in Warehouses, Yarn Market Suddenly Under Pressure, This Month Breaking Through the 4 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to fall, and the situation remained sluggish. The reason is that there is only one business day left this month. Because there is ample new yarn released into the warehouses. It was found that there were 1,000 bales of 20-count Great Flying Boat, 600 bales of Jincheng, 150 bales of Double Deer, 400 bales of Red Chief Star, 400 bales of Three Stars, 350 bales of Tianguan, 50 bales of Three Sheep, 50 bales of Baoyi, and 50 bales of Awakening Lion, totaling 3,150 bales. There are also more than 2,000 bales of yarn that cannot continue to be arbitraged. Therefore, the market situation was under pressure, and the flaws were immediately apparent.</p>

<p>At the opening of the auction yarn market in the morning, the short-term market was under pressure due to sufficient deliveries, and the market situation stepped down. After the second round, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were suspended, and sellers became more active, and the falling wind became more intense. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 7, 8, 9 cents to 1 yuan and 3 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, the situation was extremely panic, because the daily Japanese yarn merchant orders fell sharply by 3, 4, and 6 yuan, so they sold short in groups. This month broke through the 4 yuan mark. However, after the second round, the short-term market still belonged to the sluggish, but long-term bullish gold traders and financial circles still did not let go, causing it to recover. As a result, the near month fell by 2, 4, and 5 cents compared to the morning closing price, and the far month rose by 3 and 4 cents.

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, but the situation was more stable than the yarn market. Because Tongji absorbed a large amount in April, the amount was huge, and the market situation was dominated by it. However, the will of the general industry was inclined to sell, and the market atmosphere in the long term was tired.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Auction Cotton Closes with an Even More Intense Downturn <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the auction cotton market in the morning, the American cotton market was calm, with ups and downs. Indian cotton rose by 0.25 to 1.25 rupees, and Osaka Sampin yarn fell by 1.2 cents. The market was extremely shocked, and everyone was unanimously bearish. However, Tongji purchased as much as possible in the 4th term at a limited price of 4.2 yuan, and did not purchase in the long term, so the market price fell. After the second round, the yarn market was weak, and until the closing, the falling trend was abundant. As a result, the near month fell by 5 cents compared to the closing price of the previous month, and the far month fell by 2.3 cents. At the opening of the afternoon market, it followed the downturn of the yarn market, but after entering, short sellers actively covered, and gradually rebounded.

<p>At the opening of American cotton yesterday, the news from Liverpool was not good, bulls closed positions, cotton farmers sold, foreign merchants sold new cotton, and each month fell by 1 to 5 pounds. Then, due to purchases by the same industry and short covering, it slightly improved. However, there were not many buyers. As a result, spot prices rose by 1 pound, and futures rose or fell by 1 to 6 pounds. The cotton group had sales when the price of the March contract was at 11.42 cents. As of the 20th, the reported cotton group for the March contract was 41,000 bales. There has been no progress in the farmland case, and the proposer of the Smith case is also on vacation.

It was found that the quality was all 16-17 count raw materials. Most of the purchases were made by foreign firms, and textile factories directly ordered only 3,000 pieces.

<p>Recently, the European and American silk markets have gradually seen a turning point, and Yokohama silk prices may also have the possibility of rising, so the transaction of silk through Shanghai users is becoming more and more active. Because there is a shortage of silk in Shanghai, and silk factories have a tendency to stockpile goods, the price is therefore rising further. The Robin Hood grade of white factory silk, with 20/22 strands, is the most popular. Yesterday, it was sold at 810 yuan. In addition, brands such as Tiantai and Red Swastika have also risen to 810 yuan to 820 yuan, which is 30 yuan higher than last week. Therefore, overseas transactions are still difficult to approach.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Securities - March Settlement - Public Bonds Showed Slight Conflict Between Bulls and Bears - Yesterday's Market Resulted in Mixed Price Increases and Decreases - Today Only Trading for a One-Month April Term <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw the last day of March futures. Although only two types, A and B, were traded in March, totaling only 1.12 million, there was still a squeeze on shorts and longs. However, the squeeze was very limited, as there was no ability to take delivery or no goods to deliver. Therefore, settlement hedging was evident, and the environment seemed unfavorable to the bulls, with the trend slightly weakening. Sellers were Nos. 10 (formerly No. 78), 11, and 43, which were more numerous. No. 4 then turned to buying. The March B contract squeezed shorts by a small 0.65 yuan, while the A contract squeezed shorts slightly, rising by 0.05 yuan. It can be seen that due to this month's settlement hedging, the conflict between bulls and bears was real. From an environmental perspective, it was still easier to fall than rise. Yesterday, the opening market was weak and lifeless, with trading relatively active. Most were down by a small 0.1-0.2 yuan. The B contract for this month's bull settlement squeezed shorts by a maximum of 0.4 yuan. No. 10 saw a surge of selling. Subsequent trading was slightly lighter, with the prices of A and C contracts unchanged, and the rest slightly recovering by about 0.1 yuan. After the afternoon opening, trading was quite active, rare in the past two weeks. Nos. 43 and 11 both sold, while No. 4 turned to buying, mostly by 0.05-0.3 yuan. However, the March A contract rose by 0.1 yuan due to short hedging. At the close, only No. 11 sold, with slight trading. No. 4 bought limited amounts, and the rest were mostly scattered retail transactions, with mixed price increases and decreases, only fluctuating by 0.05-0.2 yuan. Today, only trading for a one-month April futures contract will take place. The number of outstanding accounts for April, including five types of unified public bonds, totals 17 million, with the 96 bonds still having about 3.1 million remaining. Yesterday's market results showed the March A contract rising by 0.05 yuan, the B contract falling by 0.65 yuan, and the April contracts fluctuating by a small 0.1-0.45 yuan. The total volume traded was 2.82 million, with the 96 bonds accounting for 1.09 million. The resulting increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

Agricultural tool stocks were quite strong, utility stocks were firm, and cement and construction stocks were very strong due to the need to repair or rebuild houses damaged by floods. According to the Steel Association's estimates, steel mills' work is affected by the flood, currently at 53%. However, steel stock prices still rose. Today's market news included several good reports. For example, in 1935, United Chemical Dye Company's earnings per share were $8.71, compared to $6.83 last year. Union Carbide's earnings per share were $3.03, compared to $2.25 last year. Anaconda Copper Mining's earnings per share were $1.29, compared to $0.22 last year. Stone &amp; Webster Company's earnings were $92,628, compared to a loss of $973,782 last year. Small exchange stock trading was sluggish, and the bond market rose slightly. The total daily trading volume was 1.68 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Food - People in the Flour and Wheat Industry Are All Bearish <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened, it initially appeared stable, but then gradually declined. Chicago and Canada both quoted the price of foreign wheat, continuing to fall by 0.20 yuan. Market sentiment was cautious due to the cold weather. Buyers had already stopped buying, and people in the industry were all bearish on the flour market. Trading was mutually exclusive, so activity was scarce. By the time the afternoon market opened, it was still calm at first. Later, shorts in the industry added to their positions, and longs absorbed very little, resulting in a weak situation and a gradual decline. According to speculation by people in the industry, the price of new flour is already high and needs to be lowered a bit.</p>
<p>The wheat market saw no trading in either current or forward months. Because foreign wheat was down slightly, domestic currency sentiment was flat and tired. Therefore, although trading was not very smooth, bids continued to loosen by 0.01-0.03 yuan. By the time the afternoon market opened, June trading was not smooth. In July and August, due to the flour market softening, customers sold off considerably, falling another 0.01-0.02 yuan compared to the morning. If the weather is good later, wheat seedlings will emerge, and the new wheat market situation is still expected to be tired. The current wheat market sees little trading, and prices are stable. Shandong wheat opened at 5.30 yuan, jointly organized by Fu and Fu, with 1,300 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat market conditions, according to estimates, this year's cultivated area will be 70 million acres, the largest number since 1928. The weather station forecasts rain in the southwest. Although there are reports of large sandstorms, market sentiment is bearish. Last week's visible supply estimates decreased by 1,698,000 bushels, and Canadian wheat decreased by 395,000 bushels.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Thick Japonica Silver Dollar Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's sources from various gangs reached Nos. 27 and 28 (a total of more than 6,000 stones of goods). Sales in this street were normal. Baohe, Qingdao, Dalian, and Yantai gangs took about 2,000 bags, so the market situation tended to be stable. Rice saw no changes. Only thick japonica rice was bid up by a few points due to scarce supplies. The prices of Duyang pointed rice and Jiangyin exchange silver dollars remained stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, various gangs arrived by ship from Hexia, Nos. 26 and 27. The market's outlets for various goods were limited. The price of white japonica rice was weak. The sales of thin rice on this street were sluggish, with prices down by 0.04-0.05 yuan. Early rice was down a few points. The price of exchange silver dollars was stable. The sales of foreign silver dollars were slightly active, with prices rising by nearly a foot. The rest of the goods were about the same as before.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Locally Grown Hsien Rice Sales Are Still Good <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's hsien rice market saw continued arrivals from various ports along the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang, and only this street was still active as an outlet. Other merchant groups had mostly stopped operating. The North Ocean gang also only handled Hexia rice and foreign wheat. Hsien rice arrived in large quantities and sold in small amounts. The market was originally weak, but large merchant groups continued to seek sales and were willing to lower prices to release their stocks. Rice prices again saw a small decline of a few points to about 0.1 yuan. A total of more than 3,300 bags of lower-quality rice, 124 bags of sanded rough rice, more than 100 bags of Taiwanese rice, 1,200 bags of small twisted rice, and 50 tons of contract rice were opened throughout the day. Except for a small amount of foreign rice being purchased by customers, all were handled by this street, it is said.</p>

<p>From March 11th to 20th, the price statistics for opening hsien and foreign rice in this city are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e213">Sesame Market is Very Brisk - Soybean Market is Relatively Stagnant <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Since foreign merchants opened the sesame market at 11.75 yuan, market sentiment has been consistently optimistic, leading to a stable market. Currently, foreign firms are interested in buying at a price of 12 yuan, but there is still a lack of selling. Moreover, current raw sesame seeds are selling very well from the Shaoxing gang. Yesterday, 700-800 bags of various sesame seeds were traded, so the overall situation is quite brisk. Due to the sluggish sales of soybean cakes and the softening of oil prices, factories and mills are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards soybeans, so the market is stagnant. Social soybeans, Shazha soybeans, Chidou soybeans, and other beans from this street, Wenzhou, Taiwan, Fuzhou, and Shantou are still selling briskly. It is estimated that more than 1,700 bags of Chidou soybeans, 400 bags of Du soybeans, and 300 bags of Sha yellow beans were opened, with stable prices.</p>
<p>Standard soybean oil cakes have been in a consistently flat and weak situation. There has been a slight customer interest in oil cakes, and futures are still fluctuating. Standard beans have been gradually falling due to consecutive market telegrams. Current goods from various eastern beans have also been without mill consultants for a long time, and arrivals are incessant, so the market is depressed. The market price of standard beans is also declining step by step. Yesterday, the March-April standard car beans both fell to 5.18 yuan, with the March contract falling 0.09 yuan from the previous day and the April contract falling 0.07 yuan. Compared to the high price in the middle of the month, they have already fallen by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Standard oil also showed a slight downward trend, while standard cakes were slightly corrected by a few cents, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained weak. The guild's disk price for current No. 24 group of white granulated sugar was 22.10 yuan, falling another 0.10 yuan from the previous day. Re-export goods were 7 yuan, and both saw transactions. East Red White saw little fluctuation, and trading was scarce. Only current No. 4 East White fell slightly by 0.05 yuan to 22.10 yuan. Cotton White from Ben Factory No. 1 was 20.70 yuan, No. 2 was 20.50 yuan, No. 3 was 20.30 yuan, No. 4 was 20.10 yuan, and No. 5 was 19.90 yuan, falling 0.10 yuan from the previous day. The prices offered for domestically produced Qing and Red White sugars were not met, and there were no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Metals - Block Tin is in Short Supply and Prices Are Rising <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The market for block silver has recently been rising due to the small amount of spot inventory. Although actual transactions are not many, sellers remain optimistic.</p>
<p>Small Tin This commodity relies on Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Hangzhou gangs for sales. Recently, sales of tin foil have been limited, so sales have also been sluggish. However, there are not many people in Shanghai who handle this commodity, so confidence is strong, and bids are also firm. The asking price is still around 190 yuan per dan. It is estimated that only 300-400 dan have been traded this week.</p>
<p>Dutch Tin This commodity has a limited source, so Shanghai inventory is very scarce. Dealers opened at 205 yuan, but there is still little spot available for purchase. Transactions include the local kerosene company, machine factory, and Dalian gang all buying small amounts. However, since the credit crunch, buyer procurement has sharply decreased, so transactions are sporadic.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Tin Sales from the Sichuan gang are not strong, and business on this street is also scarce, so the market feels quite deserted. Fortunately, confidence is still strong, and the asking price is around 202-203 yuan. It is estimated that only a dozen dan have been traded in recent days.</p>
<p>Solder Solder is divided into two types: regular and secondary. Regular solder is mostly sold to large factories, while secondary solder is widely sold to exchange shops. Transactions are limited to sporadic sales, and large-scale business is rare. Prices have also risen slightly due to the price of Dutch tin, with regular numbers estimated at 65 yuan and secondary numbers at 55 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>— (Ji Yijie)</p>
<p>There are rarely people who stand on the same front with each other. They are either sleeping in the same bed with different dreams or going their separate ways. In a nutshell, they are driven by selfish desires. Different mentalities form different contradictory facts. So-called unity and so-called cooperation are all nonsense.</p>
<p>Money and power are mutually reinforcing. Having money without power is like a three-legged cow that cannot stand firmly. Having power without money is like a two-legged tiger that cannot jump. Only when money and power are mixed together can things be accomplished and people be harmed.</p>
<p>Someone's lackey, someone's henchman, on the surface, seems loyal to someone. But if that person falls out of favor one day, they will go and follow someone else to live their lackey's and henchman's life. If their new master is your enemy, they may even turn against you and attack you until you are completely battered and bruised. Those who plant parties and pursue private interests can rest.</p>
<p>The world is getting worse day by day, people's hearts are sinister, they deceive each other, and they squeeze each other out. Good people who are currently good will have no place to stand. If you want to be a good person, you must uphold justice and strive to fight against evil people. If you have good intentions and he has bad intentions, the result will still be in vain.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Talking About Azaleas <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The myriad colors of spring can certainly delight the eye; however, there are also those who yearn for home and feel melancholy and lament when facing flowers. Among all the flowers, the most likely to evoke thoughts of separation is the azalea. Li Bai, in Xuancheng, upon seeing the azalea, wrote a poem saying:</p>
<p>"I once heard of the cuckoo bird in the Shu Kingdom, and now I see azaleas in Xuancheng. Each cry breaks my heart, and every spring month I remember Sanba."</p>
<p>According to legend, the cuckoo bird is also called the azalea bird. When it cries, its voice is mournful, as if calling "It's better to return home," which is enough to stir the traveler's thoughts of returning home. Moreover, the azalea flowers bloom all over the valleys, and seeing them naturally makes one's heart break.</p>
<p>The azalea is also known as the mountain pomegranate. Bai Juyi's poem to Yuan Jiu says, "Mount Shang and Qin Mountains are frightening, mountain pomegranate flowers are red along the road!" This also means that azalea flowers evoke people's sorrows.</p>
<p>There is also a story that is extremely sad and glamorous. Langhuan Ji says:</p>
<p>"Once, someone was drinking at the Xie family in Jincheng, and the daughter peeked and was pleased by him. When everyone heard the cuckoo singing, they left Xie's house. The daughter hated it very much. Later, when she heard the cuckoo singing, she was startled like a leopard. She ordered the maids to drive it away with bamboo branches, saying, 'Do you still dare to come here and sing!' Therefore, the cuckoo is called Xie Leopard."</p>
<p>Although this story seems unrelated to azalea flowers, the time when azaleas bloom is the time when cuckoos sing sadly. Therefore, azalea flowers are also called Xie Leopard flowers, as seen in Gewu Bian.</p>
<p>In the Tang Dynasty, azalea flowers seemed to be very precious. Wang Jian's Palace Poems says:</p>
<p>"Taiyi came from the warm room the other day, and asked Zhaoyang to beg for medicine to plant; the emperor bestowed a clump of red rhododendrons, and before thanking him, he reported that the flowers had bloomed." According to legend, azalea flowers are also called mountain rhododendrons, as also seen in Gewu Bian.</p>
<p>Matching this poem, there is Bai Juyi's playful question about mountain pomegranate flowers, saying:</p>
<p>"A small mountain pomegranate tree is planted near the steps, half containing red sepals and bringing flowers: How can I know that Sima's wife is jealous, and it will not bloom when moved to the courtyard."</p>
<p>The previous poem says "Before thanking him, he reported that the flowers had bloomed," which is so joyful! This poem says "It will not bloom when moved to the courtyard," which is so sad! Mr. Bai's wife must be a female tiger!</p>
<h3 id="e219">"So Warm" <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>Although he also started as a coolie, he is now "so warm." He is "so warm," the leader of that group of coolies. Although his shoulders used to carry carrying poles, and his legs used to be beaten with rattan sticks, now he doesn't touch the carrying pole with his fingers. In hot weather, he wears a short silk gauze shirt and trousers. In cold weather, he wears a wadded coat made of horse-cloth. With a cigar in his mouth and a rattan whip in his hand, he paces back and forth among a large group of coolies, scolding Zhang San from time to time, or beating Li Si's legs with the rattan whip.</p>
<p>"So warm, there are so many goods recently, and the pieces are so big. Our group of coolies is really a bit overwhelmed. Please do a good deed and ask the foreman to add a few more people to the group," a coolie pleaded one day.</p>
<p>"Bullshit, who says they can't handle it? Whoever says that can get out of here, that's it. If the foreman finds out about this, he will definitely fire all of you. The foreman is still saying that he can't make money this year and is thinking of reducing the number of people in the group," So Warm said with a sneer.</p>
<p>A few days later, someone pleaded again: "So warm, everything is so expensive now. We work twelve hours a day and still don't get six dimes. If we get sick for a day, we have to deduct four dimes. It's really not enough to live on. Please have mercy and give us seven dimes a day according to the number in the guild. So warm, do a good deed, and God will bless your second concubine to give birth to a fat son this year."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? The guild issues four dimes and eight cents per worker. Who said seven dimes? Whoever said seven dimes can come and be So Warm... Hmph, let me tell you, when the No. 14 pier was being rebuilt, more than 600 coolies came to me to make contact, each paying a deposit of 300 yuan, with a daily wage of five dimes. I thought you were all pitiful, so I didn't agree to them. I think you should be more well-behaved. If the foreman finds out, he will definitely fire all of you. The ringleader will have to sit in a foreign prison. By then, you won't be able to handle it."</p>
<p>Business is booming day by day. Later? The foreman also felt that it was necessary to increase the number of coolies in the group. So he ordered So Warm to increase a group. But So Warm did not recruit new workers. Instead, he increased the working hours of each of the existing day and night shift coolies by six hours and increased their wages by three dimes. But this was So Warm's special grace to the coolies, so they all willingly fulfilled So Warm's condition of extracting half a dime from each person. Because the coolies had the labor, and working six more hours was fine, after all, they had an income of two and a half dimes a day.</p>
<p>But in less than three months, So Warm married a third concubine.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Teacher Wang <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>Anyone who knows Teacher Wang will praise him as learned and capable, a contemporary educator. Whenever every student mentions Teacher Wang, everyone will immediately think of the famous editor Yang, because when Teacher Wang is teaching Chinese, he always mentions Editor Yang every three sentences. For example: This was said by my friend, Editor Yang; this book was given to me by Editor Yang, etc.</p>
<p>The principal also accommodated Teacher Wang. He had to rely on Teacher Wang's great writing for official documents. It's not that Teacher Wang's official document format was well-researched. The principal knew that he often made mistakes, but the director of the Ministry of Education was Teacher Wang's classmate. The draft of the official document drafted by Teacher Wang was indeed never rejected, but it was difficult to say if someone else had drafted it.</p>
<p>Teacher Wang's advantage lies in that harmonious face, always smiling. He is not only extremely polite to his colleagues, but also does not embarrass his students. He always reads the newspaper during monthly and annual exams, and he also gives 60 points if the score is low. He is also willing to talk about the Dream of the Red Chamber in his spare time, so students admire him very much.</p>
<p>Once, a supervisor came to inspect, and unfortunately, Teacher Wang read "兢兢業業" (jīng jīng yè yè, conscientious and diligent) as "競競業業" (jìng jìng yè yè). After the class, the supervisor asked him for advice, and he was still so smiling, respecting the supervisor as his "teacher of one word." As a result, the Education Bureau issued a commendation order not long after. Teacher Wang's evaluation was: "Excellent in scholarship and skilled in teaching."</p>

<p>If I have the opportunity, I would also like to go to Lanzhou. I heard that they have some ways to help people who go there from Jiangnan. I am not as good as Mr. Zhang and still got a job after all. Jiefu said: Alas! Our purpose in coming here is not just that. Zhizhi didn't say anything when he heard this, just smiled. Seeing Yourong, Cheng, and Guo talking by the car, he went up to meet them. Yourong pointed to another car in front of this long-distance bus and said: You won't be lonely on the road. That car is also going to Lanzhou. When Zhiqian looked ahead, it was the two Germans, Baer and William, and the German expert Zhao Guofu was also standing there. When he saw Zhiqian, he nodded from a distance. Zhiqian said in a low voice: Needless to say, they are going to Lanzhou to peddle cars. It can be seen to what extent transportation has reached, and to what extent foreign goods are being promoted. Section Chief Chang Ke shook his head slightly and recited a line from the classics: I can go to the enemy, I can go. Guo Zhuoran said: Let's go. I mean, I still want to get to Bin County today. So Zhiqian took his hat in his hand, got into the car, and cupped his hands around, saying goodbye, goodbye. The people who were seeing him off also took off their hats and waved back. Just then, a long-distance bus also stopped at the entrance of Little Western Paradise. The car door opened, and people in suits, long gowns, and jackets, and ladies in small-sleeved cheongsams came down one after another. Someone said, "We're in Xi'an, this is Little Western Paradise." Just as Zhiqian was sizing them up, Shi Gong, who was sitting next to him, smiled and nodded to Mr. Cheng and the others, who had already bowed deeply to them. Zhiqian nodded and said: Okay, the comedy is over. The car horn honked, as if answering "No"! But the car followed this horn and drove towards the avenue of one hundred and eight stations. After that, whether it ends or not, who knows? (The End)</p>
<p>Starting next week, we will publish Mr. Henshui's latest masterpiece, "Changing Nests and Phoenixes," which is sad, glamorous, and unprecedented. Please pay attention, readers.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Notes on What I Saw <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— (Xie Yun)</p>
<p>It was a warm and sunny early spring afternoon. I took a steam train (small train) from Zhenru to Shanghai. The train wheels rumbled on the rails. I leaned against the train window and looked at the houses in the distance. The smoke from the factory chimneys drifted in the air like swimming dragons with the wind. The sky was blue and clear, and the scenery was beautiful. After the train passed Zhongshan Road, when it was approaching the temporary station of the Sun Temple in Zhabei, I saw from afar that there were two black, long packages lying next to the railway sleepers. When the wheels slowly passed, I looked down and saw that they were actually two dead babies. One was a little bigger, and the other seemed to have just been born. Their ochre-red faces were covered with sparse brown hair, lying silently in the packages. I don't know whose illegitimate children they were, or whether they were abandoned here because they were too poor to bury them after death. The wheels continued to move forward, leaving this shocking tragedy behind. At this time, my heart was thumping, echoing the spinning wheels. These two small lives had lost their vitality. This can only be blamed on them for being born in pitiable China, where society is powerless to raise them, so they are abandoned like spittle. Seeing so many strong and lively young people sacrificing themselves to hunger and bandits, I don't know how many there are, let alone these little lives with their milk hair not yet dry and unable to resist all attacks? If they were born in a strong country, they would be in a nursery being raised at this time. How could they have died without anyone to bury them?</p>

<h3 id="e223">How Food Transforms Into Flesh and Blood <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Chuyu</p>
<p>We eat food every day to sustain life and avoid starvation. But what actually happens inside our bodies after we eat? How does digestion occur, and how do the nutrients absorbed through digestion transform into flesh, blood, muscles, and bones? We should understand this basic knowledge. Generally, after food enters our bodies, it changes its original shape and nature within a few hours. A portion of it becomes various substances within the body. The subtle changes rely on the power of "acid enzymes" to function. Now, I will briefly explain the process of these changes.</p>
<p>Each time we eat, the food enters the stomach. The gastric juice contains an enzyme called "Pepsin." With the help of hydrochloric acid, it initially acts on the proteins in the food, transforming them into "Peptone." This involves breaking down the proteins into "Amino acids." Then, in the intestines, the pancreatic juice secreted by the pancreas contains the enzyme "Trypsin." With this enzyme, the proteins are more easily digested. Also in the pancreatic juice, the enzyme "Amylase" acts to transform starch, which is then absorbed as sugars. Simultaneously, the enzyme "Lipase," along with bile from the gallbladder, manages the digestion of fats very effectively. In the intestinal fluid within the intestines, the enzyme "Erepsin" acts due to the effects of "Pepsin" and "Trypsin," breaking down the digested proteins more thoroughly into amino acids. Thus, our digestive organs perform highly specialized digestive functions. The nutrients digested and absorbed in this way are distributed to various parts of the body by the blood. Upon reaching various tissues, they combine with enzymes already present. Glucose becomes "Glycogen" (a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and non-crystalline substance present in the muscles and liver of the human body, which decreases when we are hungry or tired). Amino acids transform into muscles. Dissolved in water combined with other organic substances, the enzyme "Phosphatase" on the surface of bones breaks down to form "Calcium phosphate," transforming into bone. When we work, we need energy (Energie). How is this energy produced? It is because of the burning of "Glycogen" in the muscles (the term "burning" does not mean like burning charcoal with fire and high temperature, but rather burning at the body temperature of about 37 degrees Celsius). First, glycogen is converted into glucose through the action of enzymes, and then oxidation enzymes cause the burning process. However, ordinary glucose is a white crystalline substance that requires a heat of over 200 degrees Celsius to burn. Why does it burn at a body temperature of only 37 degrees Celsius? This is due to the action of the incredible enzymes. On a daily basis, our movements (such as the movement of limbs) require the work of oxidation enzymes. The heart muscle works tirelessly day and night because of the presence of strong oxidation enzymes. As for enzymes, they lose their effectiveness at temperatures above 80 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, from the perspective of plant growth, seeds that are as hard as stone can sprout and grow into towering trees when exposed to suitable temperature and moisture. This incredible phenomenon is also due to the action of enzymes, which create the stems, leaves, and branches.</p>

<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>If the symptom of joint pain is not treated or is treated improperly, it often develops into numbness in the limbs. In severe cases, it can lead to hemiplegia and paralysis.</p>
<p>The causes of this condition can be due to internal dampness and wind, residual toxins, or arteriosclerosis and uric acid poisoning. Treatment should address all aspects to be effective. Otherwise, it is difficult to cure.</p>
<p>Patient Qin Huiting had suffered from bone pain for years. Due to neglect and improper treatment, numbness developed in his limbs. Last winter, he came to me for treatment. After examining him, I diagnosed Qin as having bone pain due to gonorrhea and residual toxins embedded in his bones. I prescribed medicine accordingly and instructed him to purchase "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company. After taking several boxes of the tablets, his limbs became more flexible, and his joints felt more comfortable than ever. He said his condition had been completely cured.</p>

Therefore, he introduced his close relative Zhao Jingqiu to me for consultation. Zhao complained of premature aging, cold limbs, trembling body, sore back and waist, dizziness, fatigue, palpitations, night sweats, and other symptoms. I prescribed medicine accordingly and instructed him to purchase "Shengzhi Su" from Wuzhou Pharmacy. Because "Shengzhi Su" not only has the effect of greatly replenishing qi and blood but also has the effect of rejuvenating the body. Therefore, after taking it for less than a month, he reported a return to youth, and all his ailments were eliminated. He happily thanked me and left.</p>
<h3 id="e227">One Case of Quitting Smoking for Long-Term Stomach Pain <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>

<p>Smoking addiction often stems from illness, with stomach pain being the most common cause. For those who become addicted to smoking due to stomach pain, if the stomach pain is not completely cured first, the illness will remain, and the addiction will be difficult to break. This is why attempts to quit often fail halfway.</p>
<p>Last autumn, Pan Zengxing, who was introduced by Mr. Lu Jiyun, who had successfully quit smoking with my help, came to me to quit his smoking addiction. I learned that Pan had suffered from stomach pain for twelve years and had not been cured despite repeated treatments. As a result, he became addicted to smoking. I prescribed a formula, mainly using the famous medicine "Stomach Pain Relief" to treat his stomach pain and remove the root cause. I also used "Stomach Strengthening Supplement" to nourish his weakened stomach. Once his long-term stomach pain was relieved, I instructed him to purchase "Shengzhi Su" from Taihe Pharmacy to detoxify and break the addiction. In about four weeks, he achieved the same miraculous success as Mr. Lu.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Women's Health and Beauty <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Women's health and beauty are half natural and half man-made. Human effort can overcome nature. With the advancement of modern science, medicine, and pharmaceuticals, the ugly can become beautiful, and the weak can become strong. Therefore, I have written this article to discuss the key points, hoping to provide a reference for those who pay attention to health and beauty.</p>
<p>Women's physiology is very different from men's. Menstruation and childbirth bring many changes and illnesses. Not only do they lead to premature aging, but the breasts also become small and shriveled. It is easy to lose their inherent curves and beauty, and vaginal discharge makes it even easier to lose their health.</p>
<p>"Women's Shengzhi Su" is the only sacred medicine in gynecology. It turns the weak into the strong, the sick into the healthy. It regulates menstruation, stops vaginal discharge, calms the fetus, and ensures safe delivery. It develops the breasts and can restore the beauty of a woman in her prime to that of her wedding day. It can also help married young women regain the youthful beauty of their teenage years. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to call "Women's Shengzhi Su" a sacred medicine in gynecology and a treasure for health and beauty.</p>
<p>(Note) Women suffering from vaginal discharge should also use "Liao Dai Ling" externally at the same time. This will provide both internal and external treatment, resulting in quicker results.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Hu Wenzhao) I have been a long-time smoker, and I have repeatedly tried to quit, but I always failed due to spermatorrhea and insomnia. Recently, due to the government's determination to ban drugs, I had no choice but to seek a safe smoking cessation method. Last month, I anonymously wrote to this publication and was informed that "Ximitu's Semen Strengthening Tablets" are effective in treating spermatorrhea, and "Shengzhi Su" is a good medicine for detoxification and safe smoking cessation. I immediately purchased them from a nearby Chinese and Western pharmacy and took them as directed. Because "Shengzhi Su" is originally a good medicine for nourishing sperm and strengthening the brain, my spermatorrhea and insomnia were cured at the same time. My long-term addiction was eliminated in a short period of time, and I felt cheerful and all my ailments were eliminated. My body became strong and healthy, and I was completely different from before.</p>

<p>(Letter from Mr. Wen Xinbao) I did not cherish myself in my youth and married too early, which led to spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. Despite repeated medical treatments, they were not very effective. As a result, my condition worsened, my vitality was lost, and my body became weak. I had no hope for future generations. Last winter, I was fortunate enough to be informed by my old friend Mr. Ma that Dr. Zhan Nianzeng is an expert in treating venereal diseases. I asked him to introduce me for consultation. He administered electrotherapy and instructed me to purchase "Ximitu's Semen Strengthening Tablets" from China-England Pharmacy to treat my spermatorrhea and to take "Shengzhi Su" to treat my premature ejaculation. Because the effects were so significant, I felt relieved and continued to take half a dozen. My spermatorrhea was cured, and my premature ejaculation was also eliminated. Now, I am strong and healthy, with sufficient energy. Looking back, it is as if I have been reborn. I will never forget his contribution. I am writing this to express my gratitude and to recommend him to others.</p>

<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Sore waist, sore muscles, back pain, bone pain</p>
<p>As the world evolves and human affairs become more complex, there are more stimuli and deeper feelings. Neurasthenia has become a common disease. This condition can be divided into three levels based on its severity: spinal cord neurasthenia, localized neurasthenia, and cerebral neurasthenia. The external manifestations of these three include sore waist and back, kidney weakness and premature ejaculation, and insomnia and forgetfulness. If left untreated, symptoms such as body trembling, cold limbs, night sweats, palpitations, anemia, and premature aging will arise, forming systemic neurasthenia. At this point, the nerves are in a state of extreme weakness, and it is difficult to reverse the decline without using a large amount of "gonadal preparations."</p>
<p>Last autumn, Mr. Shi Yannong came to me complaining of sore waist and back, sore muscles and bones, body trembling, cold limbs, and numbness in his hands and feet. After examining him, I found that Mr. Shi not only had severe symptoms of neurasthenia but also had internal dampness and wind, and residual toxins. I instructed him to purchase "Shengzhi Su" and "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" from China-Western Pharmacy. Because the medication addressed the root cause of the illness, his waist and back became healthy, his muscles and bones were soothed, his body and limbs were strengthened, and his hands and feet became flexible. The effect was rapid, and he happily thanked me and left.</p>

After marriage, he infected his wife, resulting in her symptoms. (Treatment) - I mainly used "Shengzhi Su" to treat Mr. Tang's venereal disease, and "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Tablets" to remove residual toxins and treat his bone pain. For Mrs. Tang, I prescribed "Women's Shengzhi Su" internally and "Liao Dai Ling" externally to treat her uterine inflammation and hidden illness.

Sometimes he had dreams, sometimes he didn't. In a daze, he would ejaculate. Last autumn, he decided to seek treatment because the number of emissions increased and he was getting married. (Treatment) - I prescribed medicine accordingly and instructed him to purchase "Ximitu's Semen Strengthening Tablets" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to treat his spermatorrhea and nocturnal emission, and "Shengzhi Su" to replenish sperm and strengthen his brain. For rapid treatment, I also administered electrotherapy. In about a month, his condition was cured, and his body quickly recovered its strength.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Arson Burning of Shantytown Incident <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Mengruo</p>
<p>The shantytown on Yutong Road in Zhabei has recently been repeatedly forced to relocate by landlords, and we are speaking out for the hundreds of poor people there. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 7th, the thatched huts there were twice set on fire by arsonists, which is even more unfortunate for them. Although this disaster did not escalate into a major calamity, the incident itself cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>First of all, we must talk about the forced relocation. The open space there was leased to a landlord. Now, because the landlord wants to build houses, he is forcing the residents to relocate. However, the shantytown residents are all refugees from various places. Once their houses are demolished, they will have nowhere to live. Therefore, once the landlord evicts them, they are all in a state of panic. So they jointly submitted a petition to the party and government authorities, begging for help and appealing to the landlord to postpone the forced relocation. From the landlord's point of view, the open space belongs to him, leasing it was his act of kindness, and reclaiming it is his right. Therefore, forcing them to relocate is a legitimate matter. But from the shantytown residents' point of view, they are all poor people. They can only afford to live in thatched huts and have no money to rent houses. Once they are forced to relocate, where will they live? Therefore, their request to postpone the forced relocation is a last resort. Now that the landlord is repeatedly urging them, he is not considering the plight of the poor.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must mention the arson incident. Who committed the arson is unknown before the truth is revealed. But although we dare not determine who the criminal is or who instigated him, it is undoubtedly related to the forced relocation. There are several pieces of evidence. The arson occurred after the land was reclaimed. There would be no reason to commit arson for no reason. The shantytown residents also pointed out several suspects in their petition. If our guess is correct, then the seriousness of this matter is very obvious.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of this incident, we have three suggestions. The first is to severely punish the perpetrators. Deliberately setting fire to houses is a criminal offense. Fortunately, the fire was extinguished early, so only a dozen thatched huts were burned. If the fire had been allowed to spread, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Not only would all the thatched huts have been burned down, but the lives of hundreds of residents would have been in danger of being burned to death. Therefore, the authorities should strictly pursue the perpetrators and investigate the instigators behind the scenes, and punish them according to the law. The second is that although the landlord's forced relocation of the shantytown residents is reasonable, he should allow a longer period of time for each resident to find a place to live. This is of great importance to the lives of the poor. Therefore, the landlord should not force them too much, and the authorities should mediate the matter. The third is that we hope that the authorities will understand the difficulties of the people and make arrangements for the residents to resettle and provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Patrol Officer <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Dongguang</p>
<p>Leaving Lao Nangua's gambling den, it was still drizzling outside. Spring evenings turn dark in the blink of an eye. The streets were deserted, the roads were full of puddles and mud, and the shops on both sides were lit with large Mobil lamps. The shop assistants were slumped on the counters, silently watching the misty rain scene in the center of the street.</p>
<p>The rain fell softly, and the tiny drops of water, when blown onto my feverish face, brought a cool and refreshing sensation. Liu Yuchang moved his short, fat body, walking ahead of me. He was wearing the newly issued yellow military uniform, with his hat tilted on his forehead, swaying like a drunkard. He was singing "Widow Yearning for Spring" in his hoarse voice. After singing for a while, I followed him silently. When we were almost at the edge of the village, he suddenly turned his face and asked:</p>
<p>"Patrol Officer, how was your luck today?"</p>
<p>"Lost more than three dollars."</p>
<p>The two of us fell silent again. I knew he was very happy today. He had only been in the gambling den for half an hour and had won two reds in a row, so he stopped playing. He bought half a dollar's worth of opium paste from Lao Nangua and smoked a lot of it, and said he would go to the Da Jin surgical clinic at night. As for me, it was worse than touching a nun's breasts and putting them back in the treasure box - four blacks. Good, another three dollars disappeared. At this time, we walked out of the village. There was a slope, and Liu Pangzi slipped and fell. When he got up, he had rolled into a mud lion. Muttering to himself, he walked to the entrance of the station. Without saying a word to me, he turned around and went inside to change his clothes. I grabbed his arm, and he jumped down from the steps and looked at me with surprised eyes, saying:</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"The Director told me to get there, what is it?! Is he even in charge of marrying wives and raising sons?!"</p>
<p>I glared at him. He ignored me and ran inside. I calculated in my mind that I was out of luck because of this bastard. If he hadn't asked me to go, I might have won back my money and then won a few more dollars from him. Thinking this, I walked into the backyard. Listening to the Director's room, it was very quiet. I pulled open the door of the outer room, and the Director coughed a couple of times and asked:</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>I quickly replied, and hurried into the inner room.</p>
<p>The Director was lying on the bed alone, smoking opium. He raised his head, squinted at me in the light, and said:</p>
<p>"Why are you back so late?"</p>
<p>I didn't dare to say anything, standing at the door with a red face. After a while, I stole a glance at the Director and saw that he didn't look like he was going to scold me, so I felt a little relieved. He kept his mouth tightly closed, looked at the teacup, and I quickly picked up the teapot, poured a cup of tea and handed it over. He swallowed it in one gulp, and then slowly let a wisp of gray smoke filter out of his mouth. Sitting up straight, he lit another cigarette and slowly instructed:</p>
<p>"Yes, yes."</p>
<p>I slipped out quietly.</p>
<p>The brothers were arguing in the room about the case of catching the adulterer the day before. I passed through the small moon gate and was about to yell at them when suddenly one of the brothers in the room said:</p>
<p>"What did the Director tell the Patrol Officer to do again?"</p>
<p>"That kid Wu Zhan Kui will only add屁骨(a person who sucks up to someone) for the Director and make good deals!"</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, everyone laughed. I was so angry that I really wanted to rush in and hit them, but thinking about it, I decided to endure it. I stood in the rain for a while, pretending to be coming back from outside. Coughing, I opened the door and forced a yawn as I walked into the room.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Green Willow River <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Rice Mountain</p>
<p>Green Willow River roars angrily every day, like a tiger being chased, wearing clothes of yellow sand woven into waves, running from our village to the Shandong border.</p>
<p>I'm afraid it has been angry like this since it had this river. According to the noble gods, it manages all the mountains and rivers in the world. Green Willow River naturally belongs to its management. However, Green Willow River is sometimes very naughty, causing the gods to be angry, punishing it to run for life until it dries up.</p>
<p>However, we have a saying that goes, "When the cypress tree sheds its leaves, the stone roller (agricultural tool for flattening ground) flows with its heart, and the Green Willow River dries up on the shore, the world will be peaceful." This tells us that Green Willow River will not dry up. Our place will never have peaceful days.</p>
<p>No one understands why our days are getting harder and harder. Grandfather often shook his head sadly, twirling his beard and saying, "In the past, every family was happy. Thanks to the gods' blessing, we were the gods' happy people, but...but since the foreigners came..."</p>
<p>In my memory, there has never been happiness.</p>
<p>We live in a village of twenty-nine families, close to the river bank, looking out at the glittering desert, our houses built low on the sand by the river bank. Six or seven people live together in the whole family.</p>
<p>In the morning, we dry the fishing net and prepare for the day's work. That work is very hard, often busy all day, and we don't get much. Although our shoulders and backs are as tired as if they have fallen apart.</p>
<p>The old people tell us: In the past, there was never such a hard life. At that time, they sailed their boats everywhere, and sometimes they didn't go far, and they could catch a lot of fish. Also, because the carp of Green Willow River is very famous, the fish shops quickly took the fish away, and we exchanged the money for things to use. In winter, we stayed in the house to avoid the winter, or went out to find dead trees or something to use as fuel. Sometimes someone angered the gods, the boat capsized, and died, that was also a rare thing. Even there was no such thing.</p>
<p>Later, Green Willow River seemed to be going crazy, rising in water at every turn, and usually roaring like a mad dog. When the big waves came over, we simply had no way to think, praying to the gradually ineffective gods was also useless.</p>
<p>This is nothing. Because our life has trained us to be tough guys, treating life as if it doesn't matter. - Die then die, in twenty years there will be another strong young man. What makes us helpless and only angry is those foreigners' foreign ships. They simply don't have to do anything, just hear the sound of "pulala pulala", and the fish enter their nets. They dress well, eat well, but we suffer: we simply can't live anymore.</p>
<p>Every time I go fishing with my elder brother, we come back disappointed.</p>
<p>Even worse than us are those who are overturned by foreign ships.</p>
<h3 id="e238">My Travel Companion <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yeger</p>
<p>——Miscellaneous Travel Notes Two——</p>
<p>Stepping on the hazy starry night, following the stone-paved path, climbing down step by step, when I looked back up, the seven-treasure pagoda on the top of the temple was already blurred in the dimness. Everyone stopped and casually rested on the rocks by the road. The Jiangxi man, the travel companion I met at the hotel, had already taken off his baggage from his shoulder and sat silently on the stone steps. The small tobacco pouch in his mouth lightly jumped with wisps of sparks, quickly disappearing in the darkness.</p>
<p>A hundred and fifty miles of mountain road is nothing to a porter; but after not being able to find a place to rest last night and rushing all night, he became as desperate as a sick horse, sighing sadly, and then angrily cursing -</p>
<p>"Why?" he roared sadly, "Do we have to run such a cursed mountain road, while people sit securely in the company counting their abacuses, calculating countless profits?..." I ignored him, and after a while he muttered despairingly, as if answering himself, "For, this is life!"</p>
<p>The mountain was quiet, surrounded by darkness. The sharp cries of night birds faintly pierced through from the other side of the forest, quickly echoing and flying away. The Jiangxi man suddenly raised his deep eyes from silence, knocked the ashes from his small tobacco pouch onto the stone steps, hid it on his body, picked up his baggage, stood up, and quietly said, "Let's go!" So we went down the mountain slope step by step again. This time he seemed much more excited, the effect of the small morning tobacco was obvious here. He had forgotten his sighs, and also forgotten his fatigue.</p>
<p>This path is familiar to everyone, especially the Jiangxi man. He told me that twenty years of time had been spent here. "Good buddy," he said, "I can walk this kind of road with my eyes closed, and there won't be any mistakes, but..."</p>
<p>He was deeply troubled by memories. So he began to describe his happy past in a sentimental tone. At that time, he was still young, and had a virtuous and beautiful wife. Not long after they got married, they followed others in the village and went out to rush the mountain road. "At that time, we often didn't feel tired. When everyone felt the threat of hunger, we stopped in the shade of the trees by the road. I took out dry food from my baggage, and she climbed up the ridge like a nimble ape, bringing back a full load of spring water. So we sat on the ground, chewing dry food, and drinking the cold spring water. ... Little buddy, I don't think you'll believe it, she was so beautiful, as beautiful as a happy queen. ...</p>
<p>"We lived such a dreamlike life for three springs. Like a soap bubble, it shattered. All that this world left me was such an emptiness, a terrible lie. ...</p>
<p>"In the year when Chen Lu was advancing to suppress the Tiger Creek Rock bandits, we were just about to return from the inner mountains, and we were intercepted by a team of plainclothes soldiers on the ridge. They said we were spies, stripped us of our clothes, and meticulously checked every pore and corner of our clothes. When I turned to look at my wife, she was also suffering the same humiliation and punishment as me. Her beautiful starry eyes were filled with tears, and her hands deeply covered her face, letting her healthy and full limbs be exposed in the warm sunlight. A crude black man showed a mouthful of yellow teeth, greedily grinning at her, and even stretched out his rough hands to playfully fondle her breasts, causing her whole body to tremble as if electrocuted, and finally she cried out. Friend, you should imagine how much pain was in my heart at that time! I couldn't wait to raise my fist and run over to give these shameless robbers a desperate beating: however, I couldn't, my hands were held by them. So I could only cry out in sorrow, shedding tears.</p>
<p>"Things ended quickly, and we were taken naked to see their officer. The facts proved that we were not bandit spies, and we were released. However, happiness never came to us again. My beautiful wife was worried and sad, and she was shedding tears of hatred so painfully. On the day we were released, without knowing it, her life disappeared on the ridge. She jumped off the top of the mountain and committed suicide. ... Friend, can I not be sad in this kind of life? I have lost happiness, and also lost tenderness. I am such a lonely person, I am old. ..."</p>
<p>The Jiangxi man hoarsely shouted, his throat was choked, and he sobbed and cried.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Nora (14) <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

<p>Helmer returned, and Nora reiterated her morning request to save Krogstad's position, even if Krogstad's position had been given to Mrs. Linde, she would ask him to dismiss another employee.</p>
<p>Helmer was very angry when he heard this. He said: I don't have weaknesses for people to attack; now the news of Krogstad's dismissal has spread throughout the company. If it spreads outside, it will be said that this new director is being manipulated by his wife - he also explained his difficulties: Krogstad's shortcomings in character may not be worth considering, but Krogstad calling him by his name will damage his dignity. In anger, he called Alan to send out the letter dismissing Krogstad.</p>
<p>Finally, he said, "I'm not afraid of anything. In an emergency, I have the courage to deal with it. My broad shoulders are enough to carry the burden."</p>
<p>He wanted to comfort Nora and returned to his study.</p>

<p>March 18th Memorial Song</p>
<p>Good sisters, good brothers, don't forget: The patriotic masses of "March 18th" were slaughtered - Good sisters, good brothers, don't forget: The traitors and warlords who sold out the country on "March 18th"! Good sisters, good brothers, don't forget: "March 18th" That was the "May 30th" that broke out in Beiping! Good sisters, good brothers, don't forget: "March 18th" That is the pyramid of national spirit! Back then, "March 18th" was just a joint threat from the eight powers: Back then, March 18th was just the Japanese warships firing cannons to suppress us, but to this day, we are still slaves of imperialism, and the enemy has already used even more vicious methods! But to this day, we are still slaves of imperialism, and the enemy has already occupied our Hebei and Chahar! Good sisters, good brothers, you must strive for success: On March 18th, we must unify the pace of national salvation! Good sisters, good brothers, you must strive for success: On March 18th, we will detonate the anti-imperialist bombs! Good sisters, good brothers, you must strive for success: On March 18th, we will answer with blood! Good sisters, good brothers, you must strive for success: On March 18th, we will commemorate it with our lives!</p>
<p>Today (Wednesday) from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM on the Ministry of Transportation Broadcasting Station (frequency 2200, telephone 18228), composer Mr. Lü Ji will teach the song.</p>

Also, because the number of children's submissions is increasing day by day, and the level is uneven, Li Shude decided to divide them into primary and advanced levels, teaching painting, and was specially allowed to extend it by half an hour, from 7:00 AM to 8:30 AM, and a painting book attached with two cents of postage will be given as a gift.</p>

<h3 id="e247">"Cowardly Hero" Released <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Locke's Four Years of Hard Work</p>
<p>This year's Paramount Company's valuable production, the famous comedian Locke's latest comedy masterpiece "Cowardly Hero" The Milky Way, has been scheduled to be released in the Great Light Cinema starting today (Wednesday). This handsome and slick king on the screen has not had a new film released for a long time, and the box office success can be predicted. According to him, in his life of filming, except for this "Cowardly Hero," he rarely uses scripts. He is idle all day, thinking about slick materials. In addition, many fans' letters often provide him with jokes. As soon as he has a fresh joke, he immediately takes it down and shoots it into the lens. Therefore, his films always have more jokes than other people's comedies. He is indeed an expert in making jokes. The reason why movie fans all over the world welcome him is because of this reason. In "Cowardly Hero," not only is there an excellent script, but also many excellent jokes made by Locke himself, so it is more brilliant than his previous works. If people in Shanghai need to relieve boredom and laugh heartily, this is a best opportunity not to be missed, and the result will definitely be able to satisfy you.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Recently, someone has advised me to be careful that movie news is "resting" for no reason, and someone from ×× Film Company called the advertising department of this newspaper (this is Mr. Gao Tianqi of Tianyi Company's old trick, which is not worth a penny when exposed, and it is still anonymous!) I am grateful that they have paid attention to me, this "news editor."</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met a friend surnamed Lin, and when we gradually talked about movie news, we talked about the above "problem." It is said that the reason was caused by "Silver Miscellany." Then, since I am the "editor" of "news," it seems necessary to say a few words.</p>
<p>I think the readers of this newspaper can probably prove it for me. The initial Silver Miscellany only "mixed" some news reports and the like, but it also occasionally harmed the bad phenomena in the film industry. So the miscellany caused trouble. It seems like, why don't you do a "news editor" steadily, and insist on "speaking up"? The situation at that time was concealing the readers, punching cold fists in the "darkness" and wanting to "prohibit" people from "speaking up" seemed a bit too "overbearing."</p>
<p>One day, I met Hei Ying at Xinya, and he told me that the thing written under the pen name "Fa Yang" was not written by him; a friend surnamed Lin also told me that "Philosopher" is sometimes not necessarily Mu Shiying's pen name. Then, this situation is very easy to understand, and I don't want to say anything more.</p>
<p>Regarding "Spring Flower," my colleague Mr. Huang received a call from a certain director, who wanted me to do some "things," and I did not do "anything." Maybe that anonymous call came from this, which made me unable to say anything.</p>
<p>In short, this year is not a "peaceful world." I remember that Shi Dongshan wanted to add two dog barks to "Song of Everlasting Regret," which was really right!</p>

<p>Miss Liang Saizhu called and said that she does not know the person "Hart," and the joint publication of "old lover" and other words is urgently corrected. However, she also hopes that Hart, who is far away in Nanjing, can give me a call.</p>
