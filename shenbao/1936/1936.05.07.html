<p>— 星</p>
<p>自國際聯盟盟約起草以來我國代表卽力爭中國在國聯行政院中之理事一席良以中國人口衆多地位重要對於國聯所納會費又甚鉅大世界上一切糾紛與中國莫不有直接間接之關係欲國聯能在正義之基礎上維持全世界之和平則此四萬萬人民組成之國家在日內瓦之盟壇上不可無常駐之代表及永久之發言權乃列强之偏見未除以中國之武力不如人不足厠身於大國之林故每次要求常任或平常任理事之席每次遭逢失敗去歲九月中國所提出之增加行政院理事席使亞洲國家在國聯行政院中有一代表之案竟遭否决不但中國人民深感失望卽世界之熱心於國聯理想者亦深覺惋惜</p>
<p>今年九月國聯行政院又將改組國聯行政院組織委員會已於近日討論理事席之分配問題據該委員會之决議則本年之國聯大會應增加行政院非常任理事一席以畀中國委員會之决議則本年之國聯大會應增加行政院非常任理事一席以畀中國委員會之决定雖尚待行政院會議之核准及大會三分之二之通過然觀今日之趨勢中國本年之得重入行政院似無甚大之困難蓋國聯者英法諸大國把持下之組織也英法諸代表旣同意則諸小國將羣瞻馬首而無甚異議此事實現中國將為國聯之半常任理事其他位與波蘭西班牙相同而遜於英法意俄一級蓋前者連選得連任後者為當然之理事也</p>
<p>現行之國際行政院組織系統實定於一九二六年羅加諾條約成立德國加入國際聯盟之時當時决定以英法意日德為常任理事添非常任理事為九人每非常任理事任期三年每年更選三分之一然九人之中惟波蘭與西班牙取得大會三分之二之同意有連選得連任之權十年以來競爭理事者唇槍舌戰衆口囂囂一九三三年增設一臨時理事席以畀葡萄牙今年期滿吾國自一九三四年任滿依例三年以內無再當選之資格然在此時期日本退盟蘇俄加盟遠東問題非常嚴重國聯威望日趨式微行政院中除土耳其外無亞洲之代表而土耳其為歐洲性質國家不足為亞洲之代議故中國之失去理事席不但中國之不幸亦國聯威信失墜之主因也</p>
<p>今羅加諾公約被毁國際盟約亦已動搖日本德國先後退盟意大利雖在國聯而已為國聯之敵日內瓦旣無力過問長城太平洋一帶之事卽萊茵多腦河間之事亦無法解决而在此日內瓦威望已達日薄　嵫之時方有畀中國以半常任理事之决心其行動之遲緩覺悟之過晚吾人不能不為英法之政治家惋惜雖然中國人民對於世界和平之熱心决不因環境惡劣而稍有低减而中國年來建設及統一工作之成就益予中國人民以參加世界合作之有力鼓動吾人對於國聯組織委員會此項决定仍表示熱烈之歡迎也</p>

<p>（東京）有田外相六日上午十一時在貴族院演說外交方針、其全文如左、</p>
<p>今次內外多事之際、担任外政重責、本日在此關於日本外交方針、開陳所見、係余所以引爲光榮者也、夫確保東亞安定、以貢獻世界和平、同時確立國際正義、增進人類福祉、乃係日本國是、余信確保日本國民生存、期望其發展、同時企圖諸國互相融和、尤以日滿兩國不可分解關係爲基礎、以舉日本爲東亞安定力之實、此爲實行上述國是之日本外交指導精神也、</p>
<p>當在此國是及指導精神之下、處理國際案件、應採取自主積極態度、並避免傷害爲大國日本之品格、以期奉副天皇頒發關於退出國聯詔書中「篤信於國際顯揚大義於宇內」之聖旨、試觀國際現狀、世界到處彌滿焦燥不滿之空氣、隨處現出行將紊亂和平之情勢、因此先行剷除釀成如此焦燥不滿空氣之原因、此爲確保世界和平之理由、固不待言、各國專念保護自國利益、爲理當然、唯溫度忠實於此之故、對於他國立塲、未有充分理解、此卽爲釀成世界焦燥不滿空氣之原因者、余確信各國政治家應致思於此、調整政治上與經濟上之關係也、</p>

<p>茲關於日本與別國關係、擬逐次開陳見解於後、日本政府爲維持東亞和平起見、希望日滿兩國與蘇維埃聯邦之關係、正常且平穩、日本政府與「滿洲國」政府、均無任何侵略的意圖、不必贅言、然近時「滿洲國」與蘇聯邦之國境方面、續出事件、又「滿洲國」與外蒙古之間、亦見同樣事件之頒發、不堪遺憾、尤其不拘境界綫之不明確、根基於片面的判斷、認有越境事實、卽時使用武器等事、除徒使國交尖銳化之外、並無任何實益、日本政府關於如此行動、曾向蘇聯邦政府當局請求注意、今在此機會、再促蘇聯政府更爲猛烈之反省也、日本政府與「滿洲國」政府曾經恊議之結果、於三月中旬、對於蘇聯邦政府提議、爲明瞭滿蘇國境全部之國境綫、採取有效適切手段、同時與此併行設立和平的解决國境紛爭之機關、而主張應先在發生最多紛爭之東部國境、由興凱湖至圖們江之區間、着手實行、吾人鑒於近來滿蘇國境事件、殆在此區間發生之事實、考慮蘇聯邦政府將必迅速允諾日本此項有實行性之提議、而該國政府亦遂已表示允諾之意、吾人希望逐漸能見其具體的恊議之進行、</p>
<p>關於「滿洲國」與外蒙古之關係、現由滿蒙之間直接進行交涉、據聞「滿洲國」隨從此交涉之進行、企圖種種懸案之和平的解决、以期樹立善隣友好關係、日本政府希望以滿蒙間直接交涉、迅速解决諸懸案、並至交換兩方代表者、由於如上說明、諸君可以推察日蘇關係現狀、决不能謂之明朗也、直言之、此根本原因、在於蘇聯邦爲政者缺乏關於日本在東亞地位之認識、及其對日本懷疑、蘇聯邦在遠東邊境地方保持過多軍備、實威脅東亞和平、吾人在此明瞭聲明、日本政府因衷心希望東亞和平、對於上述事實不能不抱有重大之關心、</p>
<p>關於「滿洲國」、以日本與該國不可分離關係爲基礎、依照决在中日滿間樹立正常關係之外交方針、極力援助「滿洲國」之經濟開發等事業、同時關於日本在諸國治外法權之撤廢、及南滿洲鐵道附屬地行政權之調整、乃至委讓、現正進行準備、以期逐漸實現此計劃、</p>

<p>（東京）廣田首相本日在貴族院演說其要旨如下、</p>
<p>前日開院式之際、由天皇拜受優渥勅語、不勝恐懼感激、曾於二月二十六日發生不祥事件、係國民均以爲遺憾者、然此僅屬軍部與外間一部份子之策動、余信國軍基礎决不爲此發生動搖、但國民兵役義務心、如爲此事件發生疑惑、而爲軍部後援之國民之間、發生動搖、則此爲國家之一大事件、吾人希望軍部在强固决意之下、闡明國軍本義、振肅軍紀、政府亦擬與軍部齊行致力一新國策、而當於達成此目的之時、保持國憲國法之尊嚴、爲現下時局極緊要之任務、</p>
<p>日本立憲政治爲由以欽定憲法規定之正節政治、政府應採政綱、曾於組閣當初業經聲明、在日本國、顯揚肇國之理想、實現一君萬民舉國一體之美、卽爲內外政治之基本、因此國體觀念之明徵、爲現下之急務、</p>
<p>日木一貫的外交方針、立脚於國際信義、以舉爲東亞安定力之實、而貢獻於世界和平與人類福祉、政府以此宗旨、擬確立積極的自主外交、蘇聯對於日本帝國、加以不當臆測、在遠東實施過大軍備、實爲日本苦於理解之事、吾人切望蘇聯邦致力緩和如此事態、</p>
<p>中國政局、最近保持比較的平靜狀態、此爲日本政府至堪欣快者也、政府對華政策、期無遺憾、俾中國是正其抗日反滿態度、促進中日「滿」之親善與提携、務希中國政府早時呼應日本政府眞摯期待、積極努力、爲達成此共通目的與日合作、政府鑒於如此國際情形之現狀、留意列國動向、致力國防之充實、及與此有關係之諸設備整備事宜、以計一掃國防上之不安、同時立脚於廣義國防見地、積極凖備日本資源之輔育與其統制及運用、觀察國運進展之情形、與現下內外情勢、須要實行重要國策之事項不少、而改革稅制、改善金融等、對於財政經濟刷新之努力、尤爲必要、</p>
<p>現在地方團體之財政極度窮苦、使地方經濟愈益疲弊、政府考究地方財政之根本的改善方法、而關於國防與產業之調和、重要產業之施設、農村更生、中小商工業之振興、各種金融施設之改善等、應要實施新時代需要之工作、政府擬在國民生活之各分野、澈底經營安定其生活之施設、如米穀自治管理、蠶繭改善、肥料統制、或設置商工組合中央金庫、確立自動車工業、自供液體燃料、又振興民間航空、强化海運事業、建設鐵路新綫、保護海外拓殖事業等、均視爲可資於國民生活之安定、企圖設立殖產工業及電力等特殊公司、（六日同盟社電）</p>
<h3 id="c72">馬塲演說財政 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>（東京）馬塲藏相演說其要旨如左、</p>
<p>昭和十一年之實行預算、大致係根據未曾成立之預算而來、實行預算及追加預算、其總額共計歲收歲出爲二十三億三百三十餘萬元、較之未曾成立之預算己增加二千五百十餘萬元、實行預算計十九億四千一百餘萬元、追加預算計三億六千二百三十餘萬元、計爲追加預算之經費則有滿洲事件費。關於陸海軍改善兵備之經費·援助貧農及輔助農村經濟復興之特別經費·治水事業·馬政第二次計劃·液體燃料政策·設立中小商工業之金融機關·振興貿易·助長民間航空等等之經費·振興東北之經費、賑災關係之經費等等是也、</p>
<p>其次爲十一年度之公債、在一般會計上係七億二百五十餘萬元、特別會計爲七千四百八十餘萬元、其中一般會計之歲收塡償公債爲五億一千一百六十餘萬元、在躍進途中之我國、其國際地位之現狀更須增加國費、估量歲收歲出、自應鞏固財政基礎、此時不能專恃赤字公債已甚明顯因此根本改革租稅制度、復將專賣事業及其他官營事業之收入與各種特別會計之收支等項、加以嚴密之檢討、以圖增加國庫之收入、當認爲必要、此時與中央財政相關聯之地方財政、亦須急謀確立、故糾正國民負擔之不平均、非實行改革稅制不可、</p>
<p>赤字公債已發行相當之多額、今後尙須繼續行之、其原因在政府欲圖公債政策之圓滑行使、以免通貨膨脹發生經濟界之惡影響、現在日本銀行减低公債之折扣、普通銀行及其他各種金融機關亦减低存欵及放欵之利率、又政府存欵部亦將新舊放欵之利率大加减低、並依此項趣旨、前後兩次將七億七千九百餘萬元之五分利國庫債券、行使低利借換、因此發行之公債均爲三分半利率、至於改善金融須减輕農村漁村之金融負擔、企謀中小商工業以及庶民金融之圓滑而行使其他適宜之金融統制、最近我國貿易狀况雖有各國之障碍多端、仍能得到非常之發展、故此種趨向須助長而促進之、以圖改善我國之國際收支、而謀充實國民經濟力、當由官商恊力維持海外市塲、努力從事開拓者也、</p>
<p>日幣之匯兌行市仍然較低、今後應注意資本之國際移動、關於外國匯兌之管理、須嚴重取締、以防資本之逃避與匯兌行市之動搖、而顧及日「滿」兩國共存共榮之趣旨、須使對「滿」之健全投資、得以圓滑進行、至爲緊要、故政府對於「滿洲國」發行國依及滿鐵發行社債以及其他等件、决計給與適當之援助也云云、（六日同盟社電）</p>

<p>中央委員周啟剛、近應敎育部敦聘為該部民衆敎育講師、曾於上月二十九日及五月二日、在中央廣播無綫電臺演講、題為「我國僑務問題」、茲將其原稿發表於後、</p>
<p>今天承敎育部王部長之約、來向各位播音預定的講題、是「我國僑務問題」、這個問題、涵義很廣、兄弟年來也曾發表過若干部份了、現在且把舊的槪念和新的感想、綜合起來、分作四個節目、　僑務之定義、國人對移殖問題之認識、　僑務行政之形態、　華僑生存之關鍵、向大家陳述、</p>
<p>僑務之定義</p>
<p>僑務問題、本來在國際上已成為數百年來世界演變的中心問題了、試看各國之充實軍備·發展航綫·增加噸位·擴張領土·爭奪市場·榨取原料·甚至所謂島嶼代管·委任統治·等等明爭暗鬥、實在沒有一件不是導源於這個問題而來的、不過我國在過去的歷史對僑務問題、不是失之自高自傲亦是自暴自棄大都以為天下除中國以外無事物、除中國人以外皆蠻夷、對一般政治經濟問題、早已忽略、所以僑務這個問題、今天要討論起來、不能不先將僑務定義、約略分晰一下、僑務兩字、就一般的意義來說、是國家在行政上、辦理關於本國人民移殖國外·及外國人民移入國內的事務、但現在世界各國、對移殖管理、各有不同、有些國家不是注重管理其本國人的移殖、而是注重管理他們的殖民地的、有些是一面管理本國的移民、一面又拓展屬地、有些是絕無屬地、專管自己的移民的、我國的僑務、當然是屬於後者、因為我國的國力問題及種種關係雖有不少外國人移入中國、但並未有施行適當的管理、現在我們僑務委員會組織法第一條之規定、「……掌理本國人民之移殖保育事項」、亦是特別與人不同的、在各國所謂移殖、或者是有了殖民地、才有殖民的行動、或者是國家有了移民的政策、才有移民的管理、可是我們的移殖與管理、都不是這樣的、實在是因為老早有了『民移』的事實、最近才有僑務機關設置、這是特別的特別了、所以我們目下的僑務、祇可談至管理自己僑民之事、故此我們僑務範圍、與僑務定義、是偏頗的了、</p>
<p>國人對移殖問題之認識</p>
<p>我前面說過世界上幾百年來的演變、最重要的是國際間的移殖問題、我們試想、遠如哥茲和梵台爾人的侵入歐洲、匈奴和其他亞細亞人的移入歐陸、突厥人從亞洲本部向小亞細亞的開拓、腦曼人的移殖英格蘭、羅馬人和亞力山大的戰爭、希臘人沿着地中海岸的邁往長征、歐洲人遠越大西洋、而向新大陸的探發、法義葡西英日等國、在太平洋印度洋作島嶼的爭奪、我國沿海島嶼與邊疆土地的被佔領、近如東菲之戰、國際間風雲的動蕩、都是殖民問題之强烈表示、所謂國際事件、世界問題、莫不集中於殖民之解决、這是大家見得到的、反觀我國過去歷史、對移殖問題、不只是未有理會、甚且在滿淸時代、曾用嚴酷的刑罰、絕對禁止國民向外移動、同時一般人士、對於向國外謀生、又都存一種鄙棄心理、這是何等奇異的事情呢、可是過去我國政府與國人、對移殖問題的觀感、雖是這樣漠視、但我們華僑移殖的數量、卻又超乎世界各國移民數量之上、華僑事業的展佈、也有相當的成就、這的確是我國商務的特徵、關於這點、我個人也曾發表過其原因的所在、現在不必贅述、不過我們所當注意的、是現代國家、現代民族、如要存其生存之因素、對於移殖這個問題、决不能再事忽視、因為一個國家、和一個民族、在整個世界潮流激湯雷中、不能再閉關自守、更不能不在國際間尋求出路、以期達到人與物的平衡、所以因移殖而發生之僑務問題、我們應該認識、是每一個國家在國際間應付人與物的一種重要政策、過去、自高自傲和自暴自棄的態度、應該澈底改革的、本來華僑移殖、在國際政治經濟上、亦占居重要的地位、已為歷史事實所公認的、世界最嚴重與最難解决的、是勞動力過剩的失業問題、從一般國際政治經濟上觀察移殖問題與失業問題、是互相表裏的、這種密切關係的形成、自然是因為本國人民、向外移動、可以减少國內的失業、增進外來的財源、所以各國都向着「殖民與殖民地」的目標來鬥爭、移殖問題、遂成了國際政治經濟上的重要焦點、但我們僑胞之海外移殖和爭奪殖民地的殖民者、逈然不同、因為我們在國際政治經濟上、不獨無爭奪的危險性、而且對移殖地有和平而偉大的貢獻、這華僑移殖的重要意義、我們應該特別注意、且要加以說明的地方、　世界各種事業之進展與繁榮、其基礎全建築在勞工上面、十九世紀之前、北美洲如美國加拿大、南美洲如智利巴西墨西哥、其餘如澳洲南洋羣島等地、都是葉蕪不治的一片荒土、得到今日的　世興繁榮、無一處不是引用華僑的勞動力、以資發展、　為我們的僑胞、工資低廉、而且刻苦耐勞、能經年累月、不分主客、為居留地不斷的努力、這　華僑移殖、在國際上所表現的第一意義、　華僑不獨向居留地貢獻勞力、同時　把我國固有的偉大文化、向居留地人民輸入海化、就我在海外華僑居留地觀察所得的、尤其在南洋羣島各處當地的文化、都含有中華民族文化的重要因素、而同樣的西方文化、其初期或至現在、直接間接、亦受有中國文化的影響、至少使中西文化、互相溝通與調和、這是華僑移殖在國際上所表現的第二意義、　各國及各殖民地開發的初期、都有人口過少之感、增加人口、是自然的要求、華僑海外之移殖、提供其需要、充實其勞働力、增進其發展、其國際上調節了人口的密度、勞働需給的均衡、這是華僑移殖、在國際上所表現的第三意義、就這三種意義說來、我們華僑的移殖、於我們國家民族、固是有利、即於世界人類、也是有益、可惜過去我們國家、對移殖問題、固太過忽略、故雖有偌大向外移殖的人民、尚無確當的管理和政策、而社會一般人士、對這「向外輸力以减少社會勞働困難、向內送資以增進國民經濟命脈」的移殖事業、也同樣少了深切的認識、本來一個民族、是應該有勇往直前的精神、才能够在世界上立得住足、如果仍是守着縮瑟自安、畏恃不振的狀態、則絕無向外開展的精神、難怪我們的領土主權、一天一天的被削奪了、試看日本對於這移殖問題、如何的重視其政府之種種努力、自不必談、祇從他們社會方面、關於移殖所組織之社團與探討移殖問題之刋物、不知凡幾、我們對之、眞是相形見絀了、我國過去對移殖問題的隔膜、固然有政治歷史的原因存在、但社會的風氣、亦有不少的影響、譬如人生以離鄕別井為苦賤、以離家遠游為不孝、以與蠻夷久處為不尊……等、都是為認識移殖問題的障礙、晚近受不了外力的壓迫、已暫有變化、希望大家從此對於移殖問題、有一個深刻的認識、本着和平與勇氣來奮鬥、使國家民族、在世界上得到共存共榮的幸福、這是我們要認識移殖問題的意義、（未完）</p>

<p>日本水兵　事、係在同義恊會、於去年十月初及十月底計議兩次、參加會議者、除彼與楊外、尙有周式庸·曁韓人傑克、並另一不知姓名之韓人、至十一月二日、彼等五人、同由該會出外選擇便於行兇之地點、蓋預爲犯罪後易於逃逸之地步也云云、並將所繪出事地點之圖一大張、及探捕事後在共地檢獲手槍子彈之圖一頁、連同前經提出之各項證物、復行呈案、次由二八九一號·與二八六四號·兩華捕報吿發現中山秀雄</p>
<p>受傷倒地　之情形、謂十一月九日夜九時零三分、巡行至北四川路日本司令部左近、據途行胡祥和及一十三四歲之女孩報吿、有人倒於血泊中、即往察視一過、立以電括轉報捕房、庭上旋傳證人胡祥和、訊據供稱、製皮鞋爲業、是夜因往寶樂安路九十號日人高岡皮鞋店收賬、行抵該處弄口、見其地停有黃包車兩輛、汽車一輛、隨聞</p>
<p>槍聲一響　、當有一人從豐樂里弄內逃竄、其人身穿黑色衣褲、曾否戴帽、則未注意、我亦即入高岡店內、以語高岡、復同出視、始察悉倒地者係一日本水兵、當隨兩華捕赴捕房、報吿一切、遂由日人高岡證明其時渠方在店開留聲機、陡聞一炸裂聲、而胡適至、聞其言乃偕同出視之經過情節、並由日本海軍陸戰隊司令部軍醫官賀加匯（譯音）證明中山秀雄之尸體、係渠檢騐、彈子從</p>
<p>後腦射入　、由前額透出、受傷槍口、與檢獲之子彈甚相符合、（此兩證人均操日語陳述、故須先轉譯英語後、由譯員蔣葆良譯成國語、）庭上繼傳證人曾元之妻姚阿福、訊據供稱、家住北四川路豐樂里六號、葉海生初不認識、直至其持手槍來向丈夫抵押二十五元之日始見之、但欵未借去、其所書之借欵聲請書、己因此案發覺而撕毀、我初以爲係我夫之友鄭偉民向捕房報吿、嗣得悉係山張琛、緣張原</p>
<p>寓居我家　、我夫與鄭談此事、彼固能聞知也、錢庭長即向被吿葉海生研訊、詎葉不特欲將前次庭訉之自白推翻、且其最近在捕房　書之供狀、亦不承認謂供狀內之詞、係彼揑造、故若重述、則已有大部份遺忘、總之中山秀雄乃由彼一人殺害、願將經過當庭供明、彼蓄意巳久、因是夜遇水兵、遂開槍</p>
<p>將其射擊　、搜出之書籍、係彼之物、書內之洞、亦彼所挖、庭上覺其供詞離奇、爰詰之曰、書籍係楊文道所有、書內之洞、亦爲楊所挖、今汝則據爲汝有、就此一點、已顯見汝所供述、碍難置信、且汝前在捕房供係兩韓人欲打該水兵、茲又何故自認行兇、葉乃供稱、在捕房書供時、尙屬腦筋糊塗、現覺此事既屬我爲、不忍誣　他人、楊文道亦未同去、前次所以</p>
<p>誣攀他人　者、因希望己身不致被辦重罪、將來出獄後、猶可作一番事業、茲則願受國法制裁、是晚所穿係黑色衣、未戴帽等語、質之楊文道、依然矢口否認、並稱同仁會向無外籍會員、更未邀周式庸來會、商議任何事件、庭上復傳胡祥和、命其辨認兩被吿中有無是晚所見逃竄之人、胡頻頻搖首、表示不能辨別、而葉即稱是晚胡雖未看我、但我却已見胡、此際被吿楊文道之律師</p>
<p>略有辯白　、而捕房律師汝葆彝則請求繼續訊問證人、並聲明有張琛者、突於昨日午後、自投捕房、謂其深知此案之內容、隨探囊出一書就之草稿、執而誦讀、言已、即將該稿呈案、旋由同仁會茶役葉阿濤到庭、證稱楊文道每日午後一二時到會、至夜午方去、從未見其間斷、葉海生則係一兩月中偶赴會一次、會負共五百餘人、無一外籍者、時楊之律師己將</p>

<p>— 張壽鏞</p>
<p>新生活三字大家以爲是新名詞，或又以爲俗語。謂之俗語，誠哉俗語也；村嫗終日操作，相語曰，今日生活做完了麽？所謂生活，即其工作也。蓋非此工作，不能生活，因名工作曰生活。更以村嫗所語問諸讀書人，生活二字，出在何處？竟有瞠目不能對者。我吿之曰：汝讀孟子乎？民非水火不能生活，甚言生活之要；村嫗所語，即本孟子。今人人知有生活，而不把孟子熟讀，將所謂得之則生，不得則死者，而竟忽諸，何以過此生活？何以談到新生活？生活之所需，莫要於水火：水火人人知求之者矣，禮義廉恥反不知求，是何輕禮義廉恥而重水火也一齊，一國也，管仲霸者之輔也，尙知敎民曰四維不張國乃滅亡。四維者禮義廉恥也。今以中國之大，黃帝神明之胄，歷代聖賢傳授業術之我祖我宗，一一留遺敎於我子孫，轉不若開化於數千年後之國，介在海外，猶知恪守禮法，可恥孰甚焉！况我國相傳之系統，首在禮敎，從前定法律，無一不從禮敎而出，所謂道之以禮也，知禮則禮義廉恥均包括共中。禮者理也，即條理也，今世所謂守秩序，即禮也。守秩序三字出於何處，問諸讀書人又瞠目莫知所對矣，我又吿之曰：汝讀書經乎？曰天秩有禮，此所謂秩也。汝讀孟子乎？長幼有序，此所謂序也。疾行先長者，謂之不弟。夫疾行先長，不禮之小者耳，乃謂之不弟，然則守秩序固古之人禮敎之始也國。或又謂今之所謂淸潔運動者，古有之乎？曰：孟子日，入其疆土地，闢田野治，則有慶。此淸潔之大者也。子張曰：灑掃應對，進退則可矣；此淸潔之小者也。王陽明引伸之曰：灑掃應對，精義入神，區區灑掃應對。乃曰精義入神，可見凡事從小處做起，而精神之有無，即於此中覘之。或又謂守時間有說乎？曰：孔子云，人而無信，不知其可；大車無輗，小車無軏；吾何以行之哉？今觀世之開會，往往時間遲誤，不知白費了多少光陰，正以守時間即是寶貴光陰，亦正以守孔子。人而無信，不知其可之戒！或又曰：今之所謂三化者，更何所本？日：孔子最講軍事浹谷之會，布置從容，倘不預先講求，幾何不辱國乎！其曰軍旅之事，未之學也，特對衛靈公而言耳。衛無用兵之必要，故對以未學，此即暴虎馮河，吾不與也之意。而其平日所愼者，即戰也。曾子曰：可以寄百里之命，臨大節而不可奪也，此非軍事化乎！子路所謂可使有勇且知方也，方之包括甚廣，軍紀其一端也。知方然後可用，不知方則不可用，若人人守軍事化，則人人皆知方矣。更舉大學一書，自明明德，以至親民，止於至善，而其末章曰生財有道，生之者衆，食之者寡，爲之者疾，用之者舒，生之爲之者，取衆取疾，食之用之者，取寡取舒·古今中外經濟原理，不外乎此，非生產化乎！自書生諱言理財，而以不治生產爲高。於是貧矣，病矣。此則生產化尤爲致治之本也。曰行有餘力，則以學文，朱子云文詩書六藝之文也，曰游於藝，曰吾不試，故藝，尤爲古之所重。宋儒所謂活潑潑地，非藝術化，則精神不能靈活，不僅僅美術也！蔣先生洞明古今中外情勢，而又折衷於孔子新生活運動，開始以來，舊染污俗，咸爲維新人心感動，如響斯應。詩曰周維舊邦，其命維新。新者革其舊之謂也。孔子曰：溫故而知新，朱子云：故者舊所聞，新者今所得，必據於舊所聞，乃有新所得。吾願全國人士，本古義而求新，得民族精神還於唐虞三代之舊，而一切舉動懍懍於物兢天擇優勝劣收之原理，革故鼎新，以求今日之生存，則詩書禮樂之中國，合士農工商而一致奮起，將超出於歐美文明諸國之上矣。湯之盤銘曰：苟日新，日日新，又日新。禦國難在此，奠國本亦在此矣·邦人君子，其共勉旃！</p>

<p>吳必顯跳高創新紀錄</p>
<p>竟達到一公尺八七一之高度　符保盧董叔權王士林僅及格</p>
<p>（北平特訊）我國參加世運會田徑選手訓練班第二次成績測騐、四日下午四時、在北平淸華大學敎育塲舉行、是日天不作美、風土揚沙、致受相當影響、選手除巳報到之二十二人外、並有新來之八百公尺名手李培根參加應試、三時前、運動塲即爲觀衆圍得水洩不通、四時甫至、即開始測騐到場者、除金長顯·孫月明·張侃三人、自動放棄權利外，林紹洲·劉長春·王禾·楊恒煥·劉世魁等五人、因病請假、董翰文又因事未到、故僅十四人參加測騐、項目爲百公尺、二百公尺、四百公尺、跳高、三級跳遠、撑竿跳、鐵球、鐵餅、標槍等九項、其八百公尺、千五百公尺、萬公尺、跳遠、高欄、中欄等六項、因無人參加、未舉行、結果跳高一項、吳必顯以一公尺八七一、造成全國新紀錄、四百公尺董叔昭、撑竿跳高符保盧、與三級跳遠王士林等三人及格標準成績、總計兩次測騐共十一人及格、是日測騐直至晚七時一刻方吿完畢、下次測騐己定於本月十一日下午四時、仍在淸華舉行、至及格選手十一人之全國體恊補助費、馬約翰已函沈嗣良催索、日內卽可匯平、茲將田徑預選訓練班第二次測騐結果誌次、</p>
<p>打破全國紀錄</p>
<p>跳高參加者、仍爲吳必顯、劉夢九二人、由一公尺七六開始、至一公尺八二、吳仍一躍而過、傻劉却費盡力氣、連跳四次、方行跳過、升至一公尺八七一時、劉巳吿退隱、吳必顯一躍而過、但左手己觸橫竿、幸未落下、此跳已打破其自己所保持之一公尺八二全國紀錄、再升至一公尺九三時、卒因疲乏、未得越過、然相差極微、</p>
<p>達到標凖成績　四百公尺爲賈連仁與董叔昭相抗、結果同抵紅綫、未分高低、成績五十二秒四、超過標凖五十三秒之紀錄、</p>
<p>撑竿跳出場者僅符保盧一人、王禾因病未出場、結果撑過　公尺六三、卽行休息、</p>

<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>三、行政槪况</p>
<p>行政組織　在現代德國國情之下，該校的行政當然是採取集權制。關於該校的校產保管及經費收支等事項係由學務委員會負責處理。學務委員會是由德僑公團推選產生的。委員會人數共有六人，先由僑民公團推選一人為委員長，然後由委員長自行聘定德僑四人為委員，連同該校校長為當然委員合計共六人。據該校校長說，此種辦法是彷照希特勒的總揆制。</p>
<p>該校校長的產生係由德國敎育部提出有敎育學識和經騐的人三四名，請學務委員會在這些候選人中選定一人。敎師的聘請也是採用同樣的辦法；當然校長可在學務委員會中參加關於聘請敎師的意見。該校有許多事務如校舍的修理，經常費的收支等均由學務委員會代管；所以校長可集中全力主持，校內的訓育事項。又因學生人數不多，校長可以獨自主持一切校務，而不需要另設其他職員襄助。</p>
<p>經費收入情形　該校本年度預算爲八萬五千元。收入方面計有：學費約五萬元；僑民公團補助金的二萬四千元；公共租界工部局補助金的七千元；其他德僑私人捐助約四千元。支出方面計有：敎職員薪金及校工工資約七萬元，佔全部支出百分之八十二；其他經常費支出約　萬五千元，佔全部支出百分之十八。各級學生所繳學費數額不等：幼稚生每年繳付一百三十元；小學生每年繳付一百六十五元；中學生前六年每年繳付二百二十元，後三年每年繳付六百元。據該校校長說，德僑子弟在該校中學畢業者爲數不多，大半學生在讀完中學六年後就此離校。這種情形是因爲中學後三年學費太貴，許多學生中途輟學就業；還有許多學生回到本國繼續攻讀。</p>
<p>四、注重自由討論</p>
<p>該校在敎學方面有一個特點，就是注重學生的自由討論。該校敎學的宗旨是發展學生的判斷力和品格。自由討論乃是發展判斷力的良好方法。自由討論可以擴展兒童的智識，使兒童獲得與明瞭各種新的觀念。所以該校敎師在小學中就鼓勵兒童自由討論；兒童在學習讀法，寫字，算術等科時，可以自由地討論學科中的智識與技能，敎師在旁加以必要的指導。自由討論的結果可使兒童體騐到許多新的心得，而能在姿勢，語言，圖畫或綴法中發表許多有創造性的工作。</p>
<p>在中學方面，自由討論的精神益加注重。中學部的課程比較的深廣，因此中學生對於深廣的課程更需要精細的理解。自由討論乃是發展中學生理解力的重要方法。中學生可是自由討論中互相刺激思想或交換研究的心得。該校對於中學部最高兩班的學生更進一步施　自學輔導法，多讓學生自動地去研究，敎師常處在輔導的地位。</p>

<h3 id="c205">王義士 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>清朝滅了明朝過後，就下了一條命令，叫江南的人全把頭髮剃了，打成辮子。那時清朝剛剛才得天下，勢力多大，這種命令又是雷厲風行的，誰敢不遵？除非是吃了老虎心豹子胆，不怕腦袋搬家的人。</p>
<p>這命令行到泰州如皋縣，如皋縣的百姓們都遵從命令，把頭髮剃了，打成辮子，只有一個姓許名呌元博的人不肯。許元博旣不是做官的，也不是讀書人，只不過是一個平平常常的百姓罷了。</p>
<p>許元博　得好，他說：「我是中國人，怎的要聽外國皇帝的話，剃頭髮。外國皇帝殺　我們的皇帝，佔了我們的地方，還不足意，還要管到我們頭髮上來，我剃了頭髮不是就成了外國皇帝的奴婢？我辦不到！殺了我的頭也使得，我不能剃頭髮！</p>
<p>這話傳到了官府耳朶裹，都驚了，他們都想：「這還了得！違抗聖旨！不辦他，上司知道了，恐怕對自己的前程還有妨害！」於是就呌人去把許元博一家人抓了來，問一問，許元博直認不諱。他們就通詳上去，把許元博定了違抗聖旨的死罪，推到刑塲斬了；許元博的妻子也定了一個充軍罪，馬上就要起身。</p>
<p>那時如皋縣有一個姓王的差人。做差人的人沒有幾個善良的。王差人雖然在做差人，却身上長有幾根硬骨頭，性情忠直，很重義氣，平常在公門裏也做了不少方便人的事，正合了俗話說的「公門裏好修行」那句話，同事們都尊敬他，縣裏知道他的人也都尊敬他，都不叫他們名字，稱他做王義士。</p>
<p>許元博不肯剃頭髮，被斬了，死得忠直，也死得義氣，知道的人都要嘆息幾聲，滴幾點眼淚。許元博死了還不上算，還要把他的妻子充軍，更叫人憐憫，氣憤了。</p>
<p>許元博關在監牢裏，還沒被斬的時候，王義士就想救他。但是自己不過是一个差人，還說不上「官卑職小，」拿甚能力去救許元博？只有眼睜睜看着劊子手把人頭從許元博項上取了去，又眼睜睜看着許元博的妻子充軍去！哎！這解差又偏偏派了王義士。</p>
<p>王義士從縣官那裏領了批文，走到街上，心下想道「派着我也好，免得許娘子在路上吃虧。哎！像許元博那樣忠義的人，竟被這些胡塗虫殺了，殺了還不够，還要把許娘子充軍！哎！我從前想救許元博沒有法子救，現在許娘子是我解送，總得想法子救她才是。」</p>
<p>王義士一面走一面想，不知不覺已經走攏自己的家了。</p>
<p>一直到了晚上，王義士還沒有把救許娘子的法子想好。本來，這不是容易的事，自己是解差，决不能把犯人隨隨便便的放了。只有一個法子，另外尋一個婦人來冒充許娘子，就可以把許娘子放了。這到是好方法。但是到那裏去找這樣一個人來？誰又能够丟了自己的舒服生活不過，却跑去替別人受苦？這眞是天下第一件難事。</p>
<p>這件事難壞了王義士，他一晚上都沒有睡安穩，只在床上翻來覆去歎氣。王義士平常本　不是這樣的，今天忽然這樣起來，王娘子不能不詫異了，她便問：「你幹嗎這樣不安，又嘆氣？」王義士只在想自己心裏的事，不去答應她。</p>
<p>王娘子又問：「到底爲了甚麽事？」</p>
<p>王義士說：「不是你們婦人們辦得了的事。」</p>
<p>王娘子說：「你不要說我是一個婦人，就小覷了我。你吿訴我到底爲了甚麽事，我或許可以替你想法。」</p>
<p>王義士正不得主意，聽見王娘子這樣說，就想：「有一個人商議也好。」於是就把許元博夫婦犯罪的原因，同自己想要救許娘子的話說了。</p>
<p>王娘子就說：「你佩服許元博的義氣，想要救他的妻子，眞是大丈夫幹的事。如果能够找得到一個人，替許娘子去就好了。」</p>
<p>王義士說：「是啊！但是在那裏去找這樣一個行俠仗義的婦人，去替許娘子受苦呢？我就爲這件事爲難。」</p>
<p>王娘子聽了，沉吟不語，過了一會，就正正經經的向王義士說：「我願意替許娘子去。救人救澈，救了許娘子，也就成全了你。我願意替許娘子去！」</p>
<p>王義士眞想不到自己的妻子會丟下舒服生活不過，去替別人受苦。但是這事　難了，他始終有點相信不過，就問王娘子：「你說的是眞話，還是說着玩的。」</p>
<p>王娘子說：「誰說玩話，當眞我願意替許娘子去。你會做大丈夫，難道我不會做女丈夫不成。」</p>
<p>王義士趕忙翻身下床，跪在地上說：「賢妻！你眞是女中丈夫。你成全了我！」</p>
<p>王娘子也趕緊下床，跪在地上說：「大家都爲的是救好人，救負屈含寃的人，你又何必如此呢？」</p>
<p>當下王義士就到監獄裏把許娘子領了出來，一同到了家裏，同王娘子見了面。坐定之後，王義士就把自佩服許元博，想救她，同王娘子願意替她去充軍的話說了。</p>
<p>許娘子大驚，說：「我丈夫犯罪，我去充軍，都是我們罪有應得，休說受苦，就是死，也應當我去承受。怎的勞動起娘子來！萬萬不可！」</p>
<p>王義士說：「許先生是忠義之士，合縣人那一個不讀嘆？像這樣人的娘子我不救，我還救誰去？娘子不必推辭，我夫妻倆己經商量好了。」</p>
<p>許娘子說：「萬萬不可！就說娘子願意，我心裏不安啊！萬萬不可！」</p>
<p>王娘子說：「我的主意己經打定了，娘子願意也這樣辦，不願意也道樣辦！」</p>
<p>許娘子看見王義士同王娘子這樣堅决，無法，只得哭拜於地道：「謝謝兩位的情義，我只好來生再來報答你兩位了！」</p>
<p>王義士馬上就把許娘子送到她娘家，藏起來。</p>
<p>王娘子頂了許娘子的名，充軍去了，一路上受了說不盡的風霜，數不盡的苦處，費了幾個月的日子，走了幾千里路，總算走到了。過後，如皋縣的人都佩服他夫婦倆的義氣，大家凑出一筆錢來，到王娘子充軍的地方，把王娘子贖了回　；王義士夫婦倆又算團圓了。</p>
<h3 id="c206">佛蘭克林Benjamin　Franklin（1706-1790） <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 李季珍</p>
<p>暴風雨中不怕雷殛，試騐電流。　七十多歲遠涉重洋，爲民請命。</p>
<p>佛蘭克林於一七零六年一月十七日生於美國的波士頓（Boston）。父親是個染工，他原來是英國人，移殖到美洲去的。他初到美洲的時侯，已有七個兒女，妻死續娶，又生六個。佛蘭克林是他最小的一個兒子。佛蘭克林的母親良善而多能，很能管敎兒女，弄到家裏父慈，子孝，兄友，弟恭，充滿和樂的空氣。</p>
<p>佛蘭克林八歲那年，父母送他進一個村塾讀書。那時美洲不過是英國的殖民地，文化落後，並無高等學校，只有幾個敎授一些普通書算的村整、佛蘭克林進了學塾，知道讀書不容易，努力用功，因此成績很好。父親看見兒子這樣懂得做人，很高興的說道：「我這個兒子將來一定會做成一個牧師。」因爲當時的牧師都是很有學問，能博得人尊敬的，所以他這樣期望他的愛子。不幸他的父親爲着人口多，進欵少，家境一天天貧乏下去，沒有力量供給兒子讀書。佛蘭克林入了村塾兩年，便被迫輟學，跟父親出外去當製造肥皂和蠟燭的童工。在那裏做了幾年工作，他遇事留心，也得了許多經騐。</p>
<p>有一天父親因事帶他到波斯頓去，他看見百工振興，大家各執一業，很努力的工作，他很受感動，對父親說道：「爸爸！我喜歡這充滿希望的波斯頓城，我願意留在這裏學習工業，爸爸，你肯答應我嗎？」此時佛蘭克林的哥哥雅各在波士頓開了一個印書館，父親聽了佛蘭克林的話，不忍推却他，就送他入這个印書館學習印刷。佛蘭克林半工半讀，有疑必問，非常的虛心勤謹學習一切，學業因而猛進。</p>
<p>雅各是一個忌刻和鄙吝的人，他不但不愛惜他的好兄弟，並且極力虐待他。佛蘭克林在雅各那裏做了七年工，雅各一個錢的工資也不給他。雅各還擔心佛蘭克林不肯終身做他的奴隸，先事預防，通知附近的印書館，不許雇用他的弟弟。最初佛蘭克林以爲哥哥不過比人嚴厲些罷了，並沒有懷疑他有什麽惡意。後來他發覺了他哥哥一切的奸計。他才失望，决心要走。於是他悄悄地把他的一切東西都賣了，拿着一點點錢，跑到三百里外的紐約去。他在那裏，沒有一個可靠的親戚朋友，想找一個印刷工人做也找不着。弄到幾天也不能得一頓飽。</p>
<p>有一個下午，他飢腸鹿鹿，在街頭四處躑躅，正在想法子去找可以工作的地方，忽然看見費城有一個印刷所招收工人的廣吿。他認爲這是一個救星，馬上整裝趕去。在那裏奮鬥了幾年，居然掙扎出來了。他一面經營印刷業，一面從事科學研究，不久他便發明了銅版和火爐。此時他在社會上已成爲一個重要的人物了。他自己有了地位之後，記得幼年求學艱難，因此很注重民衆敎育，先辦報，和圖書館，後來他還恐怕這樣不能澈低爲民衆謀福利，於是投身政界。到了七十歲那年，他還兩次渡大西洋赴英，爲美洲人民請求取悄印花稅，不幸失敗了，他只得拋棄政治生活，專心研究電學，另改一條途徑爲民衆謀福利。那時美洲的民衆也眞能不負他，他們請願無效，便武裝反抗，脫離英國自立，造成後來一個泱泱大國。美國獨立後，他曾一度離開研究室，代表美國的民衆，遊說各國，要求承認。他首先運動法國承認，其他各國跟着也無異議。他是美國開國的大元勳。</p>
<p>佛蘭克林很早便開始研究電學，經過多年的精細試騐，到了一七五二年，才算正式發明了「電」。那一年，有一天，陰雲四佈，雷電交作。他認爲這是他試騐從雲裏取電的最好機會。忙放下一切事情，準備試騐。他先用一幅絲綢做一個風箏，挿上約莫一尺長的鐵絲，然後縛上綫，乘風放入雲裏。他又在綫的盡頭處，拴着一個滿裹綢帶的鐵鑰匙。因爲綢是不傳電的，隔着綢握着鐵鑰匙，才不至觸電身死，他等了一會，除了天上雷聲嚮得更厲害外，毫無反應。他有些懷疑他的手續，心裏很焦急。看見天際閃閃的電光，恨不得伸手把牠抓下來。當他正萬分失望的時候，忽然大雨傾盆，把他的衣服完全淋濕了。他在雨中不斷的打寒噤，但他毫不退縮，心裏想道：「電學不能試騐成功，身體何足愛惜？今天我如果一些道理也找不出來，讓雷雨毀滅了我罷！我是不打算回去的……」他才想到這裏，風箏下面的綫，原來因爲給雨打濕了，十分鬆弛的，忽然緊張起來，手裏的鐵鑰匙也不斷爆出火花來。他一點也不害怕，一面望望天上的電光，一面又看看手裏的火花，很高興的說道：「電，你果然給我發明了。後前我說電可以從雲裏取來，雷可以設法引避，舉世的大學者誰都笑我『痴人說夢』，現在居然給我證實了！可知人如果肯爲眞理努力，斷不會不收效的。」</p>
<p>他雖然發現了電火，可是他並不沾沾自喜，就此滿足了，他還不肯收了風箏回去換衣服，他一面打冷噤，一面對着濕了的風箏錢猜想道：「爲甚麽牠最初不會傳電，等到給雨打濕了，才會傳電呢？是不是綫本來是不傳電的，給水濕了就變了能傳電呢？」後來他經過細心的研究，知道：雨水裏有傳電的游子，所以綫濕了便能傳電（因爲空氣裏的二氮化炭溶解於雨水裏而成炭酸，炭酸再分解而生正游子與負游子。這些正負游子是能傳電的。就是水的本身，也能分解而生正負游子，不過量很少罷了。）</p>
<p>自從佛蘭克林發明了電，後進的科學家才能應用他的電和他的電學原理來發明電話，電報，電燈，電車……以供世用。他贈給世界人類的福利，眞是可說無可比擬的。</p>

<h3 id="c208">如何養成學術風氣（上） <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>我們稍能考察一下目前中國的情形，那　學　空氣之淺薄，是一件不容諱言的事實。不論家庭學校以及一般的社會上，在消閑的時候，袛是低級趣味的　樂牛義，而永遠沒有正當的德性方面的培養；在工作的時侯，祇有偷巧取乖傾軋自火奔　的隨落主義，而永遠沒有在學術上工作觀點上下一番刻苦的研究：這現象充溢於一般的家庭，一般的職　羣中，就是大多數的大中小舉校裏，也同樣如此而毫無上下床之可別。所以假定我們以爲中國學術空氣之淺薄是由於基本敎育之不普及，這還是一個謬娛的估計，目前中國一般的眞相，却是不要學術，而不是欲硏求學術而不可得。這一點，我們應　鄭重地注意到的。這現象的造成，作者認爲自有其因果之存在，所以要希望麥成全國的學術風氣，非從其根本原　上着手不可。</p>
<p>爲什麽在職業綫上服務的人們不需要研求學術呢？　爲他得到這職位根本並不全仗他的學識和才能，而是依靠他直接或間接人事方面的關係的；同時他維持這職位甚目升擢他的職位，也並不全仗他的學識和才能，而是依靠他活動的能力的。我們不是常常聽到一般人說，「爲人之三昧在風馬牛」。人生的秘訣旣是風馬牛，那麽何需乎學術呢？作者曾有一位在外國研究工科的朋友，在海外足足攻讀了五年書，家產典質殆盡，　臺又復高築，畢業後，在外國工廠裏實習了五六年，他本不想回到祖國裏來了，因爲他知道祖國是祇需要風馬牛而不需要刻苦勤讀的人的。但是他的朋友們却以大義相貨，認爲應該爲祖國效勞，不應將長才貢獻在異國，這位留學生經友朋之再三敦促勸吿，便襆被返國。可惜我們道位祗知硏求學術而不通人情世故的中國留學生，結果竟貧病交迫，短命而死在祖國的旅舍裏。我們固然不能說在中國的社會裏找不到一絲一毫的正義，但至少充溢於中國一般社會中的是人事的聯繫，而鮮有因學術得到生活上的保障。這是多麽可怕的一個現象呢？於是父兄之訓勉其子弟者，往往爲應熟諗人情世故；而子弟之自勉其身者，則爲風馬牛之深究；舉世如此，人慾橫流，還談得到什麽學術空氣之淺薄與否呢？</p>
<h3 id="c209">一部新時代的民衆讀物 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 陳高傭</p>
<p>國民說部　正中書局出版</p>
<p>最近正中書局爲了推行社會敎育，適應民衆需要，特約許多專家編成二部國民說部，共一百冊。內容分爲十集：一·歷史集，二·革命集，三·第理集·四·名人傳記集，五·健康集，六·生產經濟集，七·政治集，八·防衛集，九·科學集，十·生活集。以章回小說的筆法，叙述對於國民有切實關係的各種知識，祇要讀過一二年書的人，就可以隨便閱讀發生興趣，這確是對於社會敎育的　大貢獻！日前承友人將其已經出版的五十冊寄我，使我讀了以後，發生許多感想。</p>
<p>記得半月前所謂鼓書名家劉寳全來到上海的時候，有一天晚上朋友的我同去聽劉說書，劉上台以後的一段開場白說：「說書的材　無論何人，不外三國演義，紅樓夢，西廂，水滸等幾部小說，若離開這幾部小說，則無論何人無法唱說，所以過來過去不外英雄豪傑，才子佳人的故事。」當時我聽了這話便發生一種疑問：爲甚麽不能把現代與民衆有密切關係的事情，編爲故事，作爲說書的材料？爲甚麽時至今日仍是拿上幾部舊小說爲唯一的材料？一般民衆聽了這些陳舊的故事對於目前的實際生活有甚麽帮助？假若我們把林則徐禁鴉片，曾國藩平洪楊，義和團暴亂，八國聯軍攻北京，戊戍變政，黃花岡起義，辛亥革命，以及國民軍北伐等歷史中的許多事情，編成一種趣味的故事，作爲說書的材料，不是使一般民衆聽了更有意義嗎？</p>
<p>我們又從報上常常看到各地有些靑年讀了荒誕不經的神怪小說，便信以爲眞，於是瞞過父兄，相偕逃亡，要到甚麽山上去求神仙，學劍術，我們對於這樣靑年，絕不應常說他們是腦筋簡單，思想幼稚；實在是所謂通俗小說對於人的影饗太深刻了，靑年們正在求知慾望發達之時，旣沒有正當的讀　足以適應他們的需要，那祇有拿神怪小說來讀。</p>
<p>我們冉就近來上海幾個戲院所演的戲來看，不是火燒紅蓮寺，就是西遊記，不然則是甚麽潘金蓮與馬寡婦　店，不是神怪，就是淫蕩，而居然能够每天滿座，一種戲連演一兩個月而不止。而一般觀衆則大多數爲根本缺乏現代知識的小市民，所以影饗所及，其結果眞有不堪聞問者矣。</p>
<p>由以上這些事情看來，我們不能不說中國的民衆生活太危險了，中國的社會敎育太缺乏了。我們此刻要想復興民族，首先就需要把我們的國家現代化，要想把我們的國家現代化，則必須先把民衆的思想現代化，要想把民衆的思想現代化，則對於社會敎育不能不大爲注意。社會敎育的工作當然是多方面的，而編纂一種適合時代的通俗讀物實爲目前最需要的工作。</p>
<p>我們知道多少年來支配我們社會民衆的權威，不是甚麽聖經賢傳，而是幾部通俗小說；不是孔子，孟子，朱熹，王陽明等人，而是孔明，關羽，宋江，武松等人。所謂三國演義，水滸，紅樓夢，等通俗小說，在今日雖然仍有他文學上的價値，但是他的內容，已經與今日一般民衆的生活有點不適應了。所以我們要想使民衆得到一種適應現代生活的基本知識，養成一種適合現代社會的生活態度，非有一種使民衆容易接受的新讀物不可。正中書局的這部國民說部，就可以說是應這需要而編的。</p>
<p>近年來對於民衆讀物注意的人漸漸地多起來了，如各地歌謠的搜集，各種民聞傳說的考證，在報章雜誌上常常看到，不過這種搜集考證的工作是對於硏究學問的人有用，而於一般知識淺薄的民衆無大用處，如我們考察消楚徐文長故事演變歷程，這在硏究歷史文學的人是可以知道一種傳說之演變，發生很大的趣味，但在一般僅僅識字的民衆則根本沒有這種研究興趣。所以我們現在對於通俗讀物，一方面固然需要有好學深思之士爲我們搜集考證，以爲研究資料，一方面又需有文筆流暢之人作有系統的編輯，以便民衆閱讀。國民說部之編輯，即應民衆需求之工作。</p>
<p>我把已經出版的五十冊國民說部翻閱一遍，覺着有以下幾點可稱之處：</p>
<p>採取章回小說體裁，使一件事實首尾連貫，組成一個有系統的完全故事，對於讀慣舊　章回小說的人，正是投其所好。</p>
<p>叙述簡單明瞭，沒有如舊小說的過甚鋪張，使程度淺的人讀了容易瞭解，容易記憶。</p>
<p>把專門的科學知識作爲具體化故事，使讀者在閱讀故事之中不知不覺可以得到許多科學知識。</p>
<p>把理想的事情作爲現實的故事，使人讀了以後，覺着許多美滿的生活都可以在實際上得到，使人不知不覺趨向合理生活之途。</p>
<p>以上四點是我個人閱過以後覺得滿意之點，我很希望熱心社會敎育的人士，照這樣的通俗讀物，繼續多多編著。更希望稍微讀過一二年書的識字國民，省下聽說書，讀連環圖書的時間與金錢，尋常買點這類的讀物來作爲精神上的食糧。</p>
<p>最後我想拿我個人過去讀書的一段經騐，來貢獻於編著國民說部以及購閱此種書籍的諸位作爲參考。曾記得我在小學的時候，商務書館正在出版一部少年業書，其中所載，都是中外名人故事，文字淺顯，內客純正，小小的本頭，價錢又很便宜。我每星期買一本作爲課外讀物，及至讀了二十幾本以後，忍想乃大受影響，竟然連水滸紅樓夢都不想看了。到了今日，少年叢書已經成爲過時的東西，但是我所受的影響，仍未消滅，而所謂風行一時的紅樓夢，我反而至今還沒有完全讀過。因此我很希望國民說部出版以後，對於一般識字民衆之影響，亦正如以前少年叢書對於我個人的影響一樣。</p>

<h3 id="c210">這就是英國的紳士風度嗎？ <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>看到了駐滇英領事哈定無故行兇，毆傷學校童子軍敎練員的事件，實在呌人十分憤慨！據中央社昆明電，省立商業學校童軍，要往遊覽英國花園，停隊門前，先囑門房入內通報，時英領事哈定，適在圃中，聞訊遂帶獵狗二隻出來，當由童子軍敎練員三人，上前申述來意，詎哈定聲勢汹汹，竟不分皂白，不由分說，即用手杖亂打諸人，並破口大罵，其獵狗亦躍躍欲噬，被毆三人，均受重傷。</p>
<p>由這件事實的經過情形看來，這位駐滇英領事哈定的行兇歐人，眞正是橫　之至！學校童子軍要遊覧英國花園，旣停隊門前，先囑門房入內通報，並非擅自進入者可比，哈定要是瞧不起中國學生，或有別種原因，不許外人遊覽，儘可拒絕好了。但他却一時大發威風，帶獵狗二隻出來，聲勢汹汹，不分皂白，不由分說，便用手杖亂打諸人，並破口大駡，這種粗暴舉動，實在有失領事的身分。難道哈定視中國學校童子軍要遊覽英國花園，爲有辱英人的體面嗎？或他當時剛喝醉了酒，故行動這樣反常，惟據哈定向我國交涉員聲辯，說他的行兇毆人，係出於正當處置，無端亂毆人亂駡人，還認爲是正當處置，這道理究竟是如何講呢？</p>
<p>外人在中國，無故毆打華人的事情，時有所聞，不久以前，上海曾發生過一件美國水兵毆擊華人案。現在滇省學校童子軍敎練員，又給這位英國領事哈定，行兇毆傷了。但往時歐打人的，大多是沒有身份的外人。而這次行兇的，却是身爲外交官的英國領事。這就呌我們不能不驚異了！且聰說哈定性情兇暴，在滇已行兇多次。這樣一位外交官，眞正有失英國的體面。英國號稱爲紳士國家，難道這就是英國的紳士風度嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c211">「少奶奶的扇子」觀後 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>中國旅行劇團在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>繼「雷雨」，「茶花女」，「梅蘿香」之後，我們又看到了中旅的「少奶奶的扇子。」</p>
<p>在國難日亟的現在，尤其是在</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>難的五月中，上演「茶花女」等戲，我們已經是感到戲目太軟了；而現在，又演了這陳舊的「少奶奶的扇子」。從華北來的中旅賭公，難道已忘了目睹身經過的華北現狀了嗎？</p>
<p>像「少奶奶的扇子」這樣陳舊的戲，我們看到些是什麽呢？是上流社會的紳士太太們那些靡濫無聊的生活，那些愛的遊戲，……</p>
<p>如果暴露上流社會的靡濫無聊的生活，加以嚴厲的指摘，那原是未始不可的。但是「少奶奶的扇子」顯然並不如此，這裏的喝酒，打牌，談女人，開跳舞會，那祇是作爲上流社會人物的裝飾品，是一種褒獎而不是指摘，卽使是有些所謂微妙的諷刺吧，那也祇是微妙的諷刺而已。他的功能原和熟朋友打個哈哈　，開個玩笑是同樣的。</p>
<p>但不幸的是「少奶奶的扇子」還不僅是打個哈哈而已，它背後還有更大的毒素——</p>
<p>一個女人棄了孩子背夫私逃，我認爲並不是一件了不起的罪大惡極的事情，固然，以丟了「相愛」的丈夫和可愛的孩子而出走，在私人關係上說來是一件犧牲很大的事情，如果新的對象把它玩弄了一陣再丟掉，那將更是不幸；但是，娜拉的出走，我仍不是給與她很大的同情，並且是以爲她走得對嗎？那麽，徐子明這樣的脚色，比郝爾茂實在高明不了許多，雖然別一個慫恿她私逃的，也跟徐子明同樣。</p>
<p>金女士勸她的女兒徐少奶奶依舊回到她丈夫的懷抱中去，在某種意義上說來或許是對的，但勸她回去幹什麽呢？去做一個新的賢妻良母。祗是勸她不要丟掉原來的那個待她很好的主人，像她那樣，失去了原來待她很好（？）的主人以後，是會弄得「飄泊無依，聲名狼藉」的。</p>
<p>這祇是勸人跟舊的妥恊，不要反抗！新的是不會比舊的好的！</p>
<p>雖然說，「少奶奶的扇子」中的劉伯英不會比徐子明好，或許是事實，而徐少奶奶除做一個「玩意兒妻子」之外也一無所能。然而，把臺下的觀衆又當作什麽呢？</p>
<p>這是怎樣的一種說敎！</p>
<p>至於在演出方面，舞臺裝置還是怪漂亮的，演員們的演技，則以姜明的八大人最受人歡迎，（我希望他能够再减少些火氣）唐若靑和章曼蘋演得很穩，戴涯的徐子明在動作上是很風流瀟洒的，而嗓子則太蒼老些，或許是演慣了老年人的綠故；陶金的劉伯英則嫌不够，譚汶的張亦　也演得太誇張。</p>

<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>他還想往下說，他一抬頭看見我站在旁邊，這樣，他立刻現出難爲情的樣子來，便離開床走近我的跟前，小聲：「呵，你，什麽時候回來的？」</p>
<p>我還沒有回答他的話，忽然，我的那個親戚像有些不能忍耐的樣子，大聲的搶着說：「你自己想想，你一次一次來我這裏，你那次來不說要學好，你學好了嗎？鴉片烟拍不起，就打嗎啡針，吸海洛英。你，你這麽年紀輕輕的，不想做人，房子，地，都給你賣完了。老婆，孩子，敎你騙到旅順去，你就硬着心把他們賣了。你還有臉回來說他們把你仍掉了………」</p>
<p>我難過的看了看窗戶。</p>
<p>他被他的叔兄駡得放聲哭了。他扯了扯我的衣服，這麽說：「我這回眞想戒烟，就是沒有錢，唉，………」</p>
<p>他和我說完，又用可憐的眼光，怯怯的瞅着他的叔兄。他像小孩子似的，直用手抹着眼淚，說：「就是這一次，你給我點錢，我再永遠不到你跟前了………」</p>
<p>最後，他的叔兄，終於從腰袋裏掏出八毛大洋來放在他的手裹。他像滿足似的，走出門去，在夜色黑暗中冒着雨，朝着一片樹林隱沒了影子。</p>
<p>住了三天意外的，他被兩個警察用繩子背綑着手，又來找他的叔兄。一進屋，他跪在他的叔兄的跟前，哭着哀求說：「哥哥，哥哥，我太寃枉了，我敎人家連累上了，人家偸的東西說我偸的………你快給我打個保條吧，讓我出來。」</p>
<p>他的叔兄把他推出門去。</p>
<p>兩個警察不住的用手在他的臉上搧，大聲駡：「你奶奶個口，你說有保，有保人家把你推出門來………走，走，回去坐牢吧………」</p>
<p>半月以後，聽說他死在監牢裏。</p>
<h3 id="c213">虎口 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>遼闊的天，白茫茫地像給什麽塗上了一陣灰的色采，火紅的朝旭反映着天上的幾顆寥落的晨星，便更見黯淡了；水波的傾動，閃閃地耀着幾百條銀蛇，使人睜不開眼來。在這樣的情晨裏，除了偶而祇聽到幾聲閣閣的蛙聲而外，就不易聞到其它的音波了；一切，靜靜地睡在恬寂的懷抱裏。卽使海邊的幾條漁船，也沉寞得像沒人那樣的安逸。</p>
<p>嘟！——</p>
<p>可是，那聲音把什麽都驚醒了，漁夫們猛可地在夢裏醒了過來，摸一摸污濁的油臉，伸一伸懶腰，蛙兒的啼呌，也顯見多了，閣閣的噪個不休；林子裏嘰吱嘰吱地哼着小烏的淸啼；微風吹着細草，也像把聲浪播大了一些。…於是，這海面竟如變了個樣兒那麽熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>嘟！——那聲音像是從一個黑色的冒着烟的東西裏出來似的。一邊把船身洪呀洪的震動着，一面便——嘟！——嘟！</p>
<p>順太公這次是爲了村裏要築道牆，村人誰都是窮光蛋，那個出得起錢來築牆？幸好上海還有人得發，所以順太公義不容辭地抱了本捐薄去，募了差不多也有滿百的番餅—不，現在應該設是法幣了。—欣暢暢地搭着船回來。這時，他呆呆地望着水面的白泡泡，出神地咀嚼那一個在記憶中顯得模糊的縮影；</p>
<p>不知是那時候，史家村裏曾發現個風鑑先生的足跡，據他在史家村的週圍巡視後的結論說：誠然金家村的風水眞不錯，祇可惜抵擋不住金家祠堂的虎口，猶如一隻沾着僅僅乎一些潰爛的橘子，也許包孕着無限的後患，最好，在祠堂門前築起一道牆來，堵塞了虎口。否則……</p>
<p>但，有誰相信呢。當時的史家村也曾有過一度的繁榮，對於這風鑑先生的一番無理由的荒唐言辭，直當它是一陣輕輕的耳邊風，向他反了反白眼，眼看他似乎有些「孺子不可敎也。」的模樣蹣跚着走了。</p>
<p>不過，近來的史家村確乎有些異樣了：族長應　　死了，　　請明的阿龍嫂，誠實的阿慶，阿福…他們全部叵了直脚死啦！剩下的呢？像榮發，厚發，阿水，阿炳…是些無賴，全是些吃飯不管事的强橫的傢伙。史家村在這麽的形勢下便一天天地衰敗下來了。</p>
<p>嘟！——船到了碼頭，把順太公的思維斬了個斷。</p>
<p>到家，急着預備開祠堂——會議。</p>
<p>事情就感到困難了；那祠堂門前的田地恰是阿昌公的，他是著名的括皮，在他腦袋裏有的是自私，什麽事他都不過問，至於這一次的到會，他爲的是自己的田地也許可以高賣一些兒。</p>
<p>「是嗎？阿昌公，錢一層不勞你担心，現在，祇要你允許四分田，祇四分就够了，我們向你買，我們就可以開工。」</p>
<p>當然，阿昌公說了個駭人的代價。而，阿水暴燥地在板凳上站了起來：</p>
<p>「阿昌公，那也不是金田，姓外人决也沒像你老那樣黑心。你想，我們是爲了大家，你，你也應該盡些義務，是嗎？」</p>
<p>阿昌公祇冷笑了笑，動動嘴唇，把一隻像柴梗那樣的手伸起來摸摸一抹八字鬍，冷冷地不則一聲。</p>
<p>碰！是厚發那傢伙拍着桌子咆哮起來：</p>
<p>「沒理的東西跟他說什麽呢？順太公，你替我們趕緊點子辦，有什麽三長兩短。喂！阿昌公，你尋我說話，大家都聽到，這話是我厚發說的，賴了，我就算是個龜子東西。明白嗎？你說。」</p>
<p>「着啊！順太公，你辦你的，怕他不答應呢？」阿水也伸着拳頭在桌子上碰碰地亂敲。</p>
<p>於是，阿炳哪，榮發哪，阿冬哪…一個個嘩啦嘩啦地鬧成一片，阿昌公終於在極度緊張的氛圍裏允許極低的代價而屈服了。</p>
<p>不久，史家祠堂的門口築起了一道短短的粉白的圍牆，從此史家村的人便瞭望不到那恐怖的虎口了。</p>
<p>然而，史家村仍是一天天地衰敗着。…</p>
<h3 id="c214">張仙人 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 巖</p>
<p>皇鎭上的張二現在是被尊稱張仙人了。</p>
<p>皇鎭已經三年沒有好收成，每天坐茶館的劉三爹老是咕嚕着因爲三年沒有品會，　了　　　　　，這是報應。最後是歸罪到年輕人身上；「這些小伙子，那里聽來的妖言，再要搗毀廟宇，皇鎭都要變成餓鬼了。」</p>
<p>其實小伙子也是敬信猛將爺的，但是三年來田里收不起，倉里逼緊着要催租，一年忙到頭還是一個　肚子，呌他們有什麽閒錢來孝敬猛將爺坐了紅綢轎子出巡呢？猛將爺是有威靈的，應該保佑皇鎭幾個大收成，還淸了債，塡飽了肚子，大家高高興興出三天會。但是剛一開春，國窩里沒有一粒穀了，種田的本錢還沒有着落，猛將爺要坐紅綢轎子眞是夢想了。小伙子們喝了一點酒就想搗毀猛將爺的廟宇，由他們自己來毀滅自己，皇鎭死個乾凈罷！</p>
<p>劉三爹終究是上了年紀的：「不要血氣做事，猛將爺一定沒有知道三年沒有好收成，他沒有出巡怎知道田里的好壞呢？好歹大家凑幾個錢出個小會，猛將爺看見這種情形，一定大發慈悲，今年就是個好收成…」</p>
<p>這些話都是大家心里渴望着的，於是你三吊，他一串凑了個數目，把猛將爺抬出廟門了。</p>
<p>那一天，漢子們的臉上都掛着笑容，像下雨天後的一個好太陽。把滿佈着蜘蛛網的廟宇，馬虎收拾個乾凈，猛將爺從佛龕里請出來，主請的自然是劉三爹，他把猛將爺扶進轎子的時候，心里就默默祈求着：「猛將爺，皇鎭太窮了，三年沒有好收成，轎里沒有換得新的紅綢，求猛將爺賜福，今年收個五石（普通一畝田可以收三石穀，收五石是大豐年了。）明年裝金掛彩，打三天草班戲。」邊深深地叩下頭去，把額角碰在冰冷的地磚上，皇鎭的漢子，孩子，祇要是男的，就像木排似的在劉三爹後面倒下來，每個人心里有一種企求，默默的祈禱着，一個五石大豐年的夢在每個人腦海里浮升。</p>
<p>門外一聲砲響，大家歡呼着站起身來，由四個漢子搶了猛將爺的轎子向外飛奔，那些人就在後面趕着，但是不能追着轎子，要轎子兜着皇鎭的每一條田岸，回到廟里去的時侯，大家才跟回去叩頭，再由主請的人扶猛將爺升佛龕。</p>
<p>今年因爲擺道的儀仗，那四個抬轎的漢子被五石的夢主使着，八條腿彷彿生風似的抬回廟了，但是劉三爹想扶猛將爺升佛龕的時候，發現佛龕里睡着一　人，嘴邊吐着白沫，眼請斜在眼角里，死去了似的。</p>
<p>那是張三，皇鎭上一個鳥兒郎當的人物，把祖上遺留下來的幾畝田賭光吃光了之後，到處遊蕩着。</p>
<p>「孽障！孽障！」劉三爹駡了。</p>
<p>漢子們把張三抬了下來，他甦醒了，張着很大眼睛，說着外鄉的口音：「幹什麽！咱知道皇鎭三年沒有好收成，你們好心請我出巡，我答應你們今年收個五石。」</p>
<p>漢子們呆住了。但是劉三爹馬上靈機一轉，他知道猛將爺附魂在張三身上，他朴的跪了下去，連連地叩着頭，漢子們馬上又木排似的倒在地上，大家喊着猛將爺的威靈。</p>
<p>等到張三淸醒的時侯，他幾乎嚇得跳了起來，他想逃出門去。劉三爹按住了他，吿訴他猛將爺附魂在他身上，要他以後常住在廟里，猛將爺還有話要由他傳說的。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>於是張三被尊稱張仙人。他住在廟里，受着皇鎭人的衣食，出門時候，大搖大擺地受着衆人的跪拜。鎭上人生病，或者有什麽疑難的時候，就去求張仙人，他馬上眼珠斜到眼角里，口吐白沫，學着外鄉口音，說些藥名，替他們想辦法。</p>
<p>但是一個月後，張仙人失蹤了。劉三爹吩咐漢子們到處搜尋，在鄰鎭的賭塲里找到他，他正高興地談着他裝神弄鬼的巴戲，他誇耀着他的衣服，他的錢財，他現在已是一個很有錢的人了。</p>
<p>張仙人被漢子們架回皇鎭，已打成個半死。漢子們五石的夢已打了粉碎，他們三年沒有好收成的怨毒都想在張三身上出氣。當天晚上，他們把張三綁在猛將廟的佛龕里放火燒了。</p>
<p>之後，坐茶館的劉三爹祇默默地咬着他的旱烟袋…</p>

<p>「我的愛人在勞簡淹淹死，勞蘭哪！我原意把你永遠忘記」…</p>
<p>她莫可抑制的吐露惋動的悲歌。</p>
<p>自然，當她的丈夫走回來的時，是不愛聽這樣的歌的。</p>
<p>掃爾德說她是在「貓號」。</p>
<p>掃爾德是做不着「集子」掃興回來的，他顯出異常煩燥的難堪。好像一切都使他觸眼。</p>
<p>啊！他疲倦地直躺在一隻箱子上休息着老等着妻子弄晚餐。</p>
<p>他從趕集的人羣里聽來一件刺殺的案子。</p>
<p>有一個叫豪耳的漢子被人刺殺了，在海灘上。殺豪耳的人却是爲歡迎的表兄弟騷路爾夫。</p>
<p>當他倆正在談着可憐這個凶手會遭到不幸的時後，爲　迪希望殺豪耳不是她的表兄弟。……道時候門外傳進了「行好，救我」的聲音。</p>
<p>就是那個殺人的凶手騷路爾夫走進來，氣喘喘地……他拒絕姊和他接吻，他以爲表姊知道了他是殺死豪耳的人是不會和他認識而不承認是表弟的。</p>
<p>然而，他的表姊却並不介意到。</p>
<p>自然，同樣是人類，騷路爾夫為什麽要受豪耳的欺負呢？在騷路爾夫，他認爲殺死豪耳是一場公平的爭鬥。</p>
<p>現在，他要求他的表姊把他藏起一二夜。可是，她的表姊是一個女人，她以爲「女人們是不適於做這種事情」的。但畢章因着是兄弟姊妹之間而把他藏到羊攔里去了。</p>
<p>相反的，掃爾德却怕這椿事，他憂慮着藏着騷路爾夫于他是不利的，他簡直是害怕得哭起來。他知道豪耳的哥哥安及爾德會如何的來搜查他的家，這于他自己也有生死的危險。……</p>
<p>就眞的望着馬上有不幸到來的表兄弟——騷路爾夫不救嗎？她卑視她的丈夫的勇氣。</p>
<p>然而，安及爾德終于敲打着要急的門聲走來了。</p>
<p>安及爾德强迫爲歌迪走開去。</p>
<p>經過些時的堅持，這個事先害怕得哭起來的掃爾德，給安及爾德三個銀馬克把騷路爾夫出賣了。</p>
<p>這使爲歌德眞急得沒法，乘着他們都上樓去的時候。她連忙把她的表兄弟鎖在箱子里。</p>
<p>他們怎肯放鬆呢？得看這個勇敢的表姊的智慧了。</p>

<p>唐納，藍蘋；趙丹，葉露茜；顧而已，杜明潔；這三對藝人在杭州結婚回來後，昨（五日）晚在八仙橋靑年會招待親友們。在這個茶宴上，正是羣星畢至，藝人咸集，說不盡的熱鬧，講不完的有趣；現在正話休提，且記些花花絮絮，在下面，以讓未躬與其盛者也好在紙面上知道些當時的「藝術情調」。（假用老滕語）</p>
<p>沈「怪物」西苓，原在廣西任敎，這一次因公來滬，不遲不早的恰好參與盛會。此公從生紅豆的南國而來，就帶了許多（此物最相思）的紅豆，在席上，逢到朋友，他也就每人送上兩顆，聊寄相思之情。</p>
<p>不知是誰說是紅豆可以吃的，江棟良便急不及待把紅豆往口裏就呑，那時適巧有人唸着「紅豆生南國」的詩句，唸到末一句，此物最相思一時就指着江君，引起了全堂大笑。</p>
<p>這邊正算得高興，那邊老滕拖了凌鶴夫見陳波完，給他們介紹，而他自己就裝做兩方面都不認識似的，演出爐火純靑，頗有喜劇天才的樣子。</p>
<p>司儀先生施超，一方面他得拉開嗓子報吿節目，一方面還得　來賓代表向新郎新娘要求報吿戀愛經過，演來面面俱到，噱頭百出，很能得來賓擁護。</p>
<p>位子排得很好，對對成雙的，例如胡蝶潘有聲一對，陳萬里吳湄又是一對，還有，王瑩和金山，也給排在一起。</p>
<p>新人代表店納致詞後，便輪到來賓致詞，當下推歐陽予倩代表。歐陽先生一上臺便炸了，把三對新人减爲二對，（或許是故意的）話一說出口，知道說錯了，便立刻改過來，可已惹得全塲笑個不了。他的致詞大概說：「在這樣不自由的環境裏，居然有這樣自由的結合，再有現在這樣自由的空氣，眞是高興之至，以後希望新人和來賓們團結一致，一同在這不自由的環境中求自由」。（以後尙有周劍雲等致詞，大意相同，）</p>
<p>來賓致詞以後，新人之一趙丹從外面回來了，大家要求他致詞，他說過後，顧而又被拉上來，他頭上戴了頂帽子，人家叫他除去，他可不願意，冷不防老虎鄭君里從一旁竄出，攫了他的帽子就走，這才眞相畢露，原來他爲了拍狂歡之夜，新近把頭頂的頭髮剃去，所以「癩頭怕脫帽」也。</p>
<p>新郎們致詞過了，自然有人提議新娘們也應該說幾句，於是交涉專員施超說：「等一等，讓我去疏通疏通」結果，不辱使命，新娘們輪流而出，向來賓說：「我今天眞是快活極了，說不出的高興，……謝謝諸位。」於是一扭身急忙逃入休息室。輪到葉露茜說話完畢，退身而入的時候，旁邊有位朋友突然敲了一聲鑼，那鑼聲和「欽差大臣」中中軍報吿眞的欽差大臣到了是一模一樣的。</p>
<p>不料一波未平，一波又起，周劍雲先生在那邊提出嚴重抗議說：「新郎新娘的話他們沒有聽淸楚，要求他們到那一端去重說一遍。」這抗議後來不了而了，因爲又有人提出要新人報吿戀愛經過也。</p>
<p>又是經交涉專員施超的交涉，三位新郎出來報吿戀愛經過了，趙丹說：「男女之間的愛，總是如此如此，而巳而巳。」施超說：「趙丹旣然說而巳而巳，我們就叫而已來報吿。」</p>
<h3 id="c219">「鐵馬」中蘇俄最新之水陸唐克砲車 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>而已報吿得更乾脆，他說，「我一看見她就愛上了。」</p>
<p>唐納說，「我愛她，她也愛我。」</p>
<p>又有人提議，要交涉專員施超再去請新娘出來報吿戀愛經過，施超給來賓一個暗示說，她們在那邊兒（女厠所），請推女代表去請求。結果是不了了之。</p>
<p>接着是送禮物，每一條桌子上由頭上把鮮花依次傳遞下來，等鼓聲停止，鮮花在誰手裏誰便有獎，第一組，中間　桌先來，得者是張一蘋和毛羽！第二組，陳萬里；第三組，徐懷沙。</p>
<p>第一組獎品是小花藍一只，小傘兩柄；毛羽正在把玩欣賞的時候，冷不防舒繡文從他身後來搶他的小傘，毛羽「年少英俊」，身手靈敏，躱過了來人，却不料前門拒虎，後門拒進狼，那邊結錢台生搶了去。錢台生得到了小傘，舒繡文便向他要，客串了一齣錢台生三戲舒繡文的喜劇，結果還是還給毛羽。</p>
<p>正要音樂節目開始，徐蘇靈臨時提議，要求　請歐陽予倩唱潘金蓮；　請胡蝶唱夜來香；請老滕演說。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩說，我的嗓子不好，不能唱，更且潘金蓮這齣戲，十年前我唱的時候固然愛賣銅鈿，現在則風頭祇有讓白玉霜去出了。</p>
<p>胡蝶因爲喉病新愈，所以也不能唱。結果祇有老滕來上一番頗有「藝術情調」的「如此，這個，那麽」的演說。</p>
<p>時候不早，音樂節目開始，計有郎毓秀小姐的獨唱：「小夜曲」，「玫瑰三怨」，還有位國立音樂專家先生的小提琴獨奏。有人請王瑩小姐唱日本歌，王瑩先發制人，沒有唱。</p>
<p>最後是全體合唱孫師毅作歌，名驥作曲的「六和婚禮賀曲」，「　情郎，伴新娘，六和塔下影成雙；决勝在情場，莫忘胡虜到長江，莫忘胡虜到長江！」「喝喜酒，鬧洞房，五月潮高勢正揚；共起赴沙場，同拯中華復瀋陽，同拯中華復瀋陽！」</p>
<p>時吿十一時，皆大歡喜而散。</p>

<p>Authorities State that Both Sides' Opinions are Converging; Research Has Already Begun on the Personnel Issue</p>
<p>Will Resolve the Issue As Quickly As Possible Before Tada Leaves China</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The behind-the-scenes diplomatic consultations between Hebei and Chahar are proceeding actively. Because the commander of the Japanese forces stationed in North China is being replaced, the authorities fear that there may be setbacks in personnel matters. They are consulting with Tada and Yongami within the next ten days so that everything can be resolved before Tada returns to his country. Tada will go to Beiping on the 7th and then to Tongxian to meet with the traitor Yin, after which it will become clear whether the puppet Eastern Hebei will be abolished. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 3 PM on the 6th, Yongami, accompanied by Chief of Staff Hayashi and Staff Officer Ide, visited Xiao Zhenying at the municipal government to discuss diplomatic issues.

<p>(Beiping) Chen Juesheng told reporters at noon on the 6th that a portion of the Beining Railway and the Hetie Orange project will be completed by the end of June. The remaining projects are currently being planned. Since the implementation of through transport between within and beyond the [Great] Wall, freight transport has greatly improved. The Railway Bureau's assistance in anti-smuggling efforts has been minimal because the fundamental problem has not yet been resolved. The central government is currently studying fundamental solutions. No formal approach has yet been adopted for Hebei-Chahar diplomacy. Responsible persons from both China and Japan can consult at any time. Future discussions may continue in Beiping. According to my observations, although the Hebei-Chahar issue has not yet been resolved, it does not affect the overall situation in North China. The puppet organization in Eastern Hebei fundamentally has no need to exist. The Japanese side also recognizes this, and they are now carefully discussing the steps for abolishing it. It is expected to be realized in the short term. The necessity of organizing the Hebei-Chahar Transportation Committee, due to its powers and environmental relations, is currently under consideration, so the date of its establishment has not yet been determined. I will stay in Beiping for three or four days and then return to Tianjin. There is no definite date for Chairman Song's arrival in Beiping. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Smuggling Methods are Ingenious and Limitless; Tianjin's Trade Deficit Turns into a Trade Surplus <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Exports in April Increase by a Thousand Tons Compared to March; Suiyuan Provincial Government Orders Land and Water Agencies to Assist in Anti-Smuggling Efforts; Lin Shize Visits Japanese Vice-Consul to Discuss Preventive Measures</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Anti-smuggling efforts in North China still involve many diplomatic aspects. Xiao Zhenying and Lin Shize are responsible for liaising with the Japanese side. The talks held in recent days have gained the understanding of the Japanese side. Effective methods for anti-smuggling will continue to be carried out according to the instructions of the central government. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to excessive smuggling, Tianjin Customs has turned a trade deficit into a trade surplus in April. Total exports were 25,200 tons, while total imports were 19,700 tons. Exports increased by a thousand tons compared to March, while imports decreased by nine hundred tons. This is not a genuine trade surplus, as goods are imported through smuggling methods, and there has been a sharp decline in the number of goods declared and paying regular taxes, reflecting a higher number of exports. Recently, smugglers have been using all sorts of ingenious methods to transport smuggled goods to Tianjin. Customs is investigating their secrets. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 6th, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi reported on the issue of smuggling through North China customs, and they briefly discussed strategies for prevention. Last year, the total revenue of various customs offices in North China was 40 million yuan. The 24th year [of the Republic] is about to end, and although there are no precise statistics at present, it is anticipated to be less than last year. The reasons for this are the collapse of the rural economy, the sharp decline in imports, and the low gold prices in the first half of the year, which have affected the customs' gold unit. However, the most important reason is the excessive amount of tax evasion. It is also reported that Xu Liya, the Commissioner of Tianjin Customs, will go to Nanjing and then Shanghai in the coming days to report to Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the investigation and crackdown on smuggling, the authorities here have been seeking effective methods through diplomatic channels in recent days, and there are already signs of progress. Specific measures that can be implemented may soon be formulated. Lin Shize visited Japanese Vice-Consul Nagai on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss this matter.

It was decided that the meeting would reconvene to discuss the law after the revised draft of the Ministry of Industry was sent to the Legislative Yuan. The draft will include measures for punishing the practice of offering excessive discounts and not fully reporting the amount of insurance premiums collected by various industries. Regarding the issue of suicide by the insured in the compensation portion, the original regulation stipulated that compensation would only be paid after two years of insurance. This is now considered inappropriate, as those who commit suicide generally do so due to a sudden and overwhelming stimulus and do not have prior plans to earn insurance premiums and make arrangements calmly. Therefore, it is proposed that compensation should still be paid to those who commit suicide, but not if death is caused by a crime. The clause on fire insurance compensation will specify in detail that no compensation will be paid for malicious arson. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Some people believe that the number of delegates to the National Assembly stipulated in the National Assembly Delegate Election Law does not include ex-officio delegates, and they have expressed doubts. According to an explanation from the spokesperson of the Legislative Yuan, the total number of delegates to the National Assembly is set at 1,200, which refers to the total number of delegates to be produced by regional, occupational, and special elections as stipulated in the law. Of course, the number of ex-officio delegates stipulated in the National Assembly Organization Law cannot be included. Legally speaking, there is no room for misunderstanding. In addition, the second appendix to the National Assembly Delegate Election Law, compiled by five committee members including Lin Bin, only swaps the counties, cities, and bureaus under the jurisdiction of each electoral district, based on the fact that traffic in some districts is inconvenient compared to others.

<h3 id="e30">Re-examining the Issue of China's Seat on the League of Nations Council <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Since the drafting of the League of Nations Covenant, our country's representatives have been striving for a seat for China on the League of Nations Administrative Council. This is because China has a large population, an important position, and pays a substantial amount of fees to the League of Nations. All disputes in the world are directly or indirectly related to China. If the League of Nations is to maintain world peace on a foundation of justice, then this nation composed of 400 million people must have a permanent representative and a permanent voice on the Geneva platform. However, the prejudices of the major powers have not been eliminated, and because China's military strength is not as good as others, it is not worthy to be among the great powers. Therefore, every request for a permanent or regular seat on the council has met with failure. Last September, China's proposal to increase the number of Administrative Council seats so that Asian countries could have a representative on the League of Nations Administrative Council was rejected. Not only did the Chinese people feel deeply disappointed, but also those around the world who are enthusiastic about the ideals of the League of Nations felt deeply regretful.</p>
<p>This September, the League of Nations Administrative Council will be reorganized again. The League of Nations Administrative Council Organizational Committee recently discussed the allocation of council seats. According to the committee's resolution, this year's League of Nations General Assembly should add one non-permanent Administrative Council seat for China. Although the committee's decision still awaits approval from the Administrative Council meeting and a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly, given today's trends, it seems there will be no great difficulty for China to re-enter the Administrative Council this year. The League of Nations is an organization controlled by major powers such as Britain and France. Since the British and French representatives have agreed, the smaller countries will follow suit without much dissent. If this happens, China will become a semi-permanent member of the League of Nations Administrative Council, on par with Poland and Spain, but inferior to Britain, France, Italy, and Russia. The former can be re-elected for consecutive terms, while the latter are natural members of the council.</p>
<p>The current organizational system of the International Administrative Council was established in 1926 when the Locarno Treaty was concluded and Germany joined the League of Nations. At that time, it was decided that Britain, France, Italy, Japan, and Germany would be permanent members, and nine non-permanent members would be added. Each non-permanent member would serve a three-year term, with one-third being re-elected each year. However, among the nine, only Poland and Spain obtained a two-thirds majority vote from the General Assembly to have the right to be re-elected for consecutive terms. For ten years, the competition for council seats has been fierce, with many voices clamoring. In 1933, a temporary council seat was added for Portugal. This year, its term expires. Since our country's term expired in 1934, it is not eligible for re-election within three years according to precedent. However, during this period, Japan withdrew from the League, and Soviet Russia joined, making the Far East issue extremely serious. The prestige of the League of Nations is declining daily. There is no Asian representative in the Administrative Council other than Turkey, and Turkey is a European-natured country and cannot be a representative for Asia. Therefore, China's loss of its council seat is not only China's misfortune but also a major cause of the League of Nations' declining credibility.</p>
<p>Now that the Locarno Pact has been destroyed and the League of Nations Covenant has also been shaken, Japan and Germany have withdrawn from the League one after another. Although Italy is in the League, it is already an enemy of the League. Geneva is powerless to intervene in matters along the Great Wall and the Pacific Ocean, and it is also unable to resolve matters between the Rhine and the Danube. And at this time when Geneva's prestige has reached its twilight, it has the resolve to give China a semi-permanent council seat. We cannot help but regret the slowness of action and belated awakening of British and French politicians. Although, the Chinese people's enthusiasm for world peace will never diminish due to adverse circumstances, and the achievements of China's construction and unification work in recent years have given the Chinese people a powerful impetus to participate in world cooperation. We still express a warm welcome to this decision by the League of Nations Organizational Committee.</p>

After a comprehensive plan is made for the entire issue of export tax reduction and exemption, it can be implemented on a scheduled basis. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>London The Times newspaper called the measures announced yesterday by the Chinese Ministry of Railways regarding the reorganization of the 1905 Henan Railway Gold Bonds welcome news. People in London mostly welcome it. Today, the bonds have risen by two pounds, and there are very few sellers. Although the cancellation of four-fifths of the overdue interest may be unsatisfactory, the financial community here supports the Chinese Creditors Committee's recommendation to accept it, as this measure is the best that can be obtained. It is generally believed that this is clear evidence of the improving situation in China and China's determination to restore credit. Although there have been many domestic affairs in recent years, it has still worked hard to maintain its creditworthiness, which is better than the situation of other countries that still ignore their debts despite being in a better position. It is generally felt that the method of reorganizing the Henan Railway loan is better than that of the Jinpu Railway, because this method allows for sharing the profits of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. However, the profits of this road are currently impossible to estimate. (Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives meeting began at 1:20 pm today. There was almost no space to stand in the gallery. Prime Minister Hirota, with a solemn attitude, ascended the podium, placed his hands on the table, and focused on his draft to deliver a policy speech. His words were the same as those in the House of Peers.</p>
<p>Next, Foreign Minister Arita delivered a speech. When he stated that the Soviet Union, in a distant location, is strengthening its massive military, we cannot help but be concerned, the entire audience clapped to express their enthusiastic support. Then, Minister of Finance Baba ascended the podium. He was quite nervous as he first came on stage. After reading the speech, then Minister of the Army Terauchi, amidst cheers, ascended the stage, and in the simple tone of a military man, reported on the progress of the February 26th Incident.</p>
<p>At 2:35 pm, Diet members began to question the speeches of the Ministers of State. First, Nakayama Matsuju (Minseito) briefly stated that the February 26th Incident was related to communist ideology. The government should dispel the public's doubts and finally called for freedom of speech, the abolition of martial law, and that the Japanese nation should seek development overseas. At this time, the Prime Minister returned to the stage to make a simple reply, causing a commotion in the Diet. Then the Home Minister, seeing that the situation was not good, went on stage to give a perfunctory response. At 3:20 pm, Hamada Kunimatsu (Seiyukai) made the second round of questioning, saying that the government should not focus too much on material politics but should focus on spiritual politics. He also spoke about diplomatic policy as follows:</p>
<p>Japan is the third most populous country in the world, but its resources are weak, so it must demand a redistribution of world resources for its own sake. Japanese national defense must enable diplomacy to achieve the above results and provide assistance. This cannot be achieved by a military that only engages in war.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding Minister of the Army Terauchi's statement, he questioned his so-called military's economic control and the mindset of the opinion letter on the uprising of the rebel army. He descended the stage at 4:30 pm. The Minister of the Army replied as follows:</p>
<p>The purpose of the statement is to correct capitalism and implement a totalitarian economy. As for the opinion letter on the February 26th Incident, it is entirely difficult to agree with.</p>
<p>The Minister of Education and the Prime Minister also answered in agreement. Speaker Tomita then declared a closed meeting to be held. It was already 5 pm. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Full Text of Arita's Speech <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita delivered a speech on diplomatic policy at the House of Peers at 11 am on the 6th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>At this time of many domestic and foreign affairs, it is my honor to assume the heavy responsibility of foreign policy and to present my views on Japanese diplomatic policy here today. To ensure the stability of East Asia to contribute to world peace, and at the same time establish international justice and promote human welfare, is the national policy of Japan. I believe that ensuring the survival of the Japanese people, expecting their development, and at the same time attempting to harmonize all countries, especially with the inseparable relationship between Japan and Manchukuo as a foundation, to establish Japan as a stabilizing force in East Asia, is the guiding spirit of Japanese diplomacy to implement the above national policy.</p>
<p>When handling international cases under this national policy and guiding spirit, a self-reliant and active attitude should be adopted and damage to the character of a great power like Japan should be avoided. In order to comply with the Emperor's decree regarding withdrawal from the League of Nations, "Firmly believe in internationality and promote great righteousness in the universe." Observing the current international situation, the world is filled with an atmosphere of anxiety and dissatisfaction everywhere, and situations that will disrupt peace appear everywhere. Therefore, the first step is to eliminate the causes of such anxiety and dissatisfaction. This is the reason for ensuring world peace, and it goes without saying. It is natural for countries to focus on protecting their own interests, but because they are so loyal to this, they have not fully understood the positions of other countries. This is the cause of the world's anxiety and dissatisfaction. I firmly believe that politicians from various countries should think about this and adjust political and economic relations.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Starting with Boundary Demarcation in Relations with Russia <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Japan's relations with other countries, I intend to gradually present my views below. For the sake of maintaining peace in East Asia, the Japanese government hopes that the relationship between Japan, Manchuria, and the Soviet Union will be normal and stable. It goes without saying that the Japanese government and the government of "Manchukuo" have no intention of aggression whatsoever. However, recently, incidents continue to occur on the border between "Manchukuo" and the Soviet Union, and similar incidents have also occurred between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, which is regrettable. In particular, the lack of a clear border line, based on one-sided judgments, recognizes the fact of border crossings, and immediately uses weapons, which does not provide any practical benefit other than sharpening diplomatic relations. The Japanese government has requested the Soviet government authorities to pay attention to such actions, and now takes this opportunity to urge the Soviet government to reflect more vigorously. As a result of consultations between the Japanese government and the "Manchukuo" government, in mid-March, it proposed to the Soviet government to take effective and appropriate measures to clarify the entire border line between Manchuria and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it proposed to establish a mechanism for the peaceful resolution of border disputes, and advocated that it should first start in the eastern border area where the most disputes occur, from Xingkai Lake to the Tumen River. In view of the fact that recent Manchurian-Soviet border incidents have almost occurred in this area, we believe that the Soviet government will quickly agree to this practical proposal from Japan, and that country's government has already expressed its intention to agree. We hope to gradually see the progress of concrete consultations.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia, negotiations are currently being conducted directly between Manchuria and Mongolia. It is reported that "Manchukuo" is attempting to peacefully resolve various outstanding issues in accordance with the progress of these negotiations, in order to establish good neighborly and friendly relations. The Japanese government hopes that direct negotiations between Manchuria and Mongolia will quickly resolve various outstanding issues, and even lead to the exchange of representatives from both sides. As a result of the above explanation, you can infer the current state of Japanese-Soviet relations, which cannot be said to be clear. To put it bluntly, the root cause lies in the Soviet Union's lack of understanding of Japan's position in East Asia, and its suspicion of Japan. The Soviet Union's excessive military deployment in the Far Eastern border area poses a threat to peace in East Asia. We hereby declare clearly that the Japanese government, out of a sincere hope for peace in East Asia, cannot but have serious concerns about the above facts.</p>
<p>Regarding "Manchukuo," based on the inseparable relationship between Japan and that country, and in accordance with the diplomatic policy of establishing normal relations between Japan, China, and Manchuria, we are doing our utmost to assist in the economic development and other undertakings of "Manchukuo." At the same time, regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights of Japan in various countries, and the adjustment, and even transfer, of administrative rights over the South Manchuria Railway affiliated land, preparations are currently underway to gradually realize this plan.</p>
<h3 id="e65">No Abandonment of Three Principles Towards China <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>As for Sino-Japanese relations, Foreign Minister Hirota has already explained in detail at the 68th Imperial Diet that negotiations will be conducted between China and Japan on the basis of the Three Principles towards China. In order to conduct negotiations on this basis, the Chinese authorities should understand the overall situation in East Asia, and make a major determination to undertake these negotiations. Unfortunately, it seems that the Chinese side does not have this full determination, which is regrettable. However, the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is not only extremely necessary for China and Japan, but also for peace in East Asia. Therefore, I demand a determination from the Chinese side, and at the same time, I intend to do my best to adjust Sino-Japanese relations in all aspects so that there are no regrets. The Japanese government has always paid close attention to the intrusion of red forces into East Asia. According to external reports, a part of the main force of the Communist army that previously moved from Sichuan Province to Shaanxi Province has recently invaded Shanxi Province and continues to operate, and depending on future developments, it seems to have a posture of advancing further north. The Japanese government pays great attention to this fact.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Maintaining Friendly Relations with England <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>When His Majesty King George V of England passed away on January 20, the late King reigned over the British Empire for 25 years. During this period, he dealt with the world war and other difficult and complex situations at home and abroad, and was a famous monarch praised for his wisdom and virtue. His Majesty the new King Edward VIII has long had a good understanding of the complex international political situation and has visited Japan. I hope that the future of the British Empire will be even more fortunate under the rule of the new King, and that the traditional friendly relations between Japan and England will be further enhanced. Japan and England have many common interests to investigate in various aspects of the world. However, based on the traditional friendship between Japan and England and the two countries' responsibility for world peace, and with full consideration of their respective special needs, the adjustment of their interests is by no means difficult.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the friendly relations between Japan and the United States are the key to peace in the Pacific. Japan and the United States not only have an interdependent economic relationship at present, but also the understanding between the two peoples is gradually deepening, which is what we are most pleased about. In the future, the two countries should respect each other's positions and missions, and work together to ensure peace in the Pacific. Regarding the understanding and friendship between the two countries, I intend to make further and better efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Advocating Abolition of Economic Armaments <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Secondly, observing the current state of international trade, in various foreign countries, various excuses are used to attempt to exclude foreign products, or so-called economic alliances are formed by several countries, and the trend of solidifying economic armaments is becoming more and more obvious. The Japanese government believes that if this trend is allowed to continue, the world's economic downturn will become more profound, and in the end, it will lead to the shrinking of world trade, resulting in the regression of human economic life. At every opportunity, it advocates to various countries to abolish this so-called economic armament, which can open up the world's economic downturn, and can contribute to the coexistence and co-prosperity of nations and world peace. However, Japan's advocacy has unfortunately not been accepted by most countries, and the establishment of obstacles to international trade has a tendency to expand its scope. In particular, among various foreign countries, there are those who specialize in suppressing Japanese goods, which is a major problem for countries like Japan that need to secure the supply of raw materials and the sales routes of products overseas in order to maintain the survival of the national economy. Japan should make efforts to abolish the above-mentioned economic armaments in a friendly manner, and when Japan's efforts cannot improve the situation, Japan will have no choice but to take necessary measures to deal with it. At this time, Japan's purpose is, of course, only to request the provinces of the other country to have satisfactory international trade relations, and there is no other intention.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to say a word about the issue of culture and international relations. In order to promote international understanding and friendship, the introduction of culture is extremely important, which goes without saying. In addition to the existing cultural undertakings with China, the Japanese government has established international cultural undertakings since the ninth year of Showa (1934) and has been working hard to expand them. As a result, foreign nationals studying Japan are becoming increasingly enthusiastic, and in the future, we should also strive to promote this kind of undertaking in order to deepen international understanding, promote world culture, and contribute to the enhancement of human welfare. In addition, we will improve various facilities for the existing cultural undertakings with China in order to promote cultural cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria, and promote the profound and profound oriental culture.</p>

<p>The unfortunate incident that occurred in the capital had a great impact on foreign countries and affected Japan's foreign relations. However, with the promulgation of the Emperor's dignity and the promotion of the spirit of national service, the situation was resolved and nothing happened, which can be said to be fortunate in misfortune. I firmly believe that the way to overcome the difficulties of the times and implement national policies lies in the full understanding of the international situation and the concerted efforts of all parties in the government and the public to advance towards their goals. I sincerely hope that you will provide enthusiastic assistance, and at the same time, I expect you to make the greatest efforts to fulfill your important responsibilities.

<h3 id="e71">Summary of Hirota's Speech <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hirota gave a speech in the House of Peers today, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony the other day, I received gracious words from the Emperor, which I was extremely frightened and grateful for. The unfortunate incident occurred on February 26, which is regrettable for all the people. However, this was only the action of a few elements in the military and outsiders. I believe that the foundation of the national army will never be shaken by this occurrence. However, if the national conscription obligation is doubted by this incident, and there is unrest among the people who support the military, then this is a major event for the country. We hope that the military will clarify the true meaning of the national army and rectify military discipline with a strong determination. The government also intends to work with the military to renovate national policies and maintain the dignity of the national constitution and laws when this goal is achieved, which is an extremely urgent task in the current situation.</p>
<p>Japan's constitutional politics is a legitimate political system stipulated by the constitution. The government should adopt a political program, as stated at the beginning of the cabinet formation. In Japan, glorifying the ideals of the founding of the nation and realizing the beauty of a unified nation with one monarch and all the people are the basis of domestic and foreign politics. Therefore, the clear demonstration of the concept of national polity is an urgent task at present.</p>
<p>Japan's consistent diplomatic policy is based on international trust, with the aim of contributing to world peace and human welfare by exerting its power to stabilize East Asia. With this aim, the government intends to establish an active and independent diplomacy. The Soviet Union makes inappropriate speculations about the Japanese Empire and implements excessive military preparations in the Far East, which is something that Japan finds difficult to understand. We sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will strive to ease this situation.</p>
<p>The Chinese political situation has recently maintained a relatively calm state, which the Japanese government is very pleased about. The government's policy towards China will be implemented without regret, so that China can correct its anti-Japanese and anti-Manchu attitude and promote friendship and cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. We hope that the Chinese government will respond to the Japanese government's sincere expectations as soon as possible, and actively cooperate to achieve this common goal. In view of the current state of the international situation, the government will pay attention to the trends of various countries, and strive to enrich national defense and related equipment maintenance, in order to eliminate anxieties about national defense. At the same time, based on the broad concept of national defense, we will actively prepare for the cultivation, control, and utilization of Japanese resources. Observing the progress of national fortune and the current internal and external situation, there are many important national policies that need to be implemented, and reforms of the tax system and improvements in finance are particularly necessary for the renovation of financial economy.</p>
<p>At present, the finances of local organizations are extremely poor, making the local economy increasingly exhausted. The government will study fundamental ways to improve local finances, and regarding the harmony between national defense and industry, the construction of important industries, the revitalization of rural areas, the promotion of small and medium-sized commercial industries, and the improvement of various financial facilities, we should implement the work needed in the new era. The government intends to thoroughly manage facilities to stabilize the people's lives in various fields, such as autonomous management of rice, improvement of silkworm cocoons, control of fertilizers, establishment of central financial institutions for commercial and industrial associations, establishment of automobile industry, self-supply of liquid fuels, promotion of civil aviation, strengthening of maritime transport, construction of new railway lines, and protection of overseas colonial undertakings, which are all regarded as contributing to the stability of the people's lives, and attempt to establish special companies for industry and electricity etc. (6th Allied Press Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Finance Baba gave a speech, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>The actual budget for the eleventh year of Showa (1936) is generally based on the budget that was never established. The total amount of income and expenditure for the actual budget and the supplementary budget is more than 2,333 million yuan, which is more than 25.1 million yuan more than the budget that was never established. The actual budget is more than 1,941 million yuan, and the supplementary budget is more than 362.3 million yuan. The expenses for the supplementary budget include the Manchurian Incident expenses, expenses for improving military equipment of the army and navy, special expenses for assisting poor farmers and assisting the economic recovery of rural areas, water conservancy projects, the second horse administration plan, liquid fuel policy, establishment of financial institutions for small and medium-sized commercial industries, promotion of trade, promotion of civil aviation, expenses for promoting the northeast, expenses related to disaster relief, etc.</p>
<p>Secondly, for the public bonds in the eleventh year, more than 725 million yuan is for general accounting and more than 74.8 million yuan is for special accounting. Among them, more than 511.6 million yuan of the income for general accounting is used to repay public bonds. In our country, which is on the road to leap forward, the current state of its international status requires an increase in national expenditure. Estimating income and expenditure, it is necessary to consolidate the foundation of finance. It is clear that we cannot rely solely on deficit public bonds. Therefore, it is necessary to fundamentally reform the tax system, and to thoroughly review the income of monopoly businesses and other government-run businesses, as well as the income and expenditure of various special accounts, in order to increase the income of the national treasury. At this time, it is necessary to urgently seek to establish local finances, which are related to central finances. Therefore, it is necessary to implement tax system reform in order to correct the uneven burden on the people.</p>
<p>Deficit public bonds have been issued in a considerable amount, and will continue to be issued in the future. The reason is that the government wants to smoothly implement the public bond policy, so as to avoid the adverse effects of currency inflation on the economic world. At present, the Bank of Japan is reducing the discount on public bonds, and ordinary banks and other financial institutions are also reducing the interest rates on deposits and loans. In addition, the government's deposit department has also greatly reduced the interest rates on new and old loans, and in accordance with this purpose, it has carried out low-interest borrowing and exchange of 779 million yuan of 5% interest-bearing national treasury bonds twice. Therefore, the public bonds issued are all at a 3.5% interest rate. As for improving finance, it is necessary to reduce the financial burden on rural and fishing villages, and to smoothly implement other appropriate financial controls for small and medium-sized commercial industries and the people's finance. Although the current trade situation in our country has various obstacles from various countries, it is still able to achieve extraordinary development. Therefore, this trend must be promoted and promoted, in order to improve our country's international balance of payments and to enrich the national economic strength. Officials and merchants should work together to maintain overseas markets and strive to engage in development.</p>
<p>The exchange rate of the Japanese yen is still low. In the future, attention should be paid to the international movement of capital. Regarding the management of foreign exchange, it is necessary to severely crack down on it to prevent capital flight and exchange rate fluctuations. Considering the purpose of coexistence and co-prosperity between Japan and Manchuria, it is essential to ensure the smooth progress of sound investment in Manchuria. Therefore, the government has decided to give appropriate assistance to the issuance of state bonds and the issuance of corporate bonds by the South Manchuria Railway in "Manchukuo".

<h3 id="e73">Minister of the Army Terauchi Reports on the Truth of the Tokyo Incident <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Terauchi explained the truth and process of the February 26th Incident in the House of Peers on the 6th. The gist is as follows:</p>
<p>It is extremely regrettable that an unprecedented and unfortunate incident has occurred, endangering many important national ministers. However, those who participated in the rebellious acts and those who held radical ideas were only a very small part of the entire army. The overall image of the military has not been shaken at all. The outline of the incident has been announced many times, that is, more than 1,400 officers and soldiers belonging to the 1st and 3rd Infantry Regiments, the 3rd Guards Infantry Regiment, and the 7th Field Heavy Artillery Regiment, attacked the Prime Minister's official residence, the residence of Interior Minister Saito, the residence of Education Minister Watanabe, the residence of Finance Minister Takahashi, and the residence of Grand Chamberlain Suzuki on the morning of February 26, and occupied the area around Nagatacho. There were also a small number of troops who attacked the former residence of Interior Minister Yuhara Makino. The Tokyo Garrison Commander immediately commanded the troops stationed in Tokyo to suppress the unrest and maintain order. At 3:00 p.m., a wartime security order was issued to the 1st Division's jurisdiction. A partial provision of the martial law order was implemented in Tokyo on the 27th, and at the same time, the martial law headquarters was formed. Local troops were successively ordered to come to Tokyo. At that time, it was of course possible to take strong measures to quell the rebellious troops, but because of the fear that compatriots would fight each other, causing bloodshed, and endangering nearby important institutions and important people's residences, we had to endure and restrain ourselves and earnestly advised the leaders of the rebellious troops to surrender and return. Those who participated in the incident's actions were rebellious acts, a fact that was clear when the young men left the barracks. However, at that time, they were not called rebellious troops, and were formally placed under the command of their original regimental commanders. This kind of expedient measure was also a painstaking effort to avoid stimulating the young men's excited state. However, after three days, this purpose could not be achieved, so on the 29th, we had to resolve everything by force. Fortunately, there was no exchange of fire, and it was completely quelled in the afternoon. The military authorities, in order to eliminate the root of the disaster, supervised the military and police agencies, and closely contacted the judicial police to search in various aspects. Regarding the results, because they are related to public security, the contents will be explained in a closed meeting. In the military, the absoluteness of military command and obedience is the root of military discipline. The rebellious troops' officers offended the sacredness of the order, but the lower-ranking soldiers believed that it was an order from their superiors and joined the rebellious troops. The military authorities are now making their best efforts to clarify the responsibility for the origin, command, and action of the order, so as to avoid leaving a root of disaster in the future, and to avoid causing the people to have doubts about the military service obligation. The motive of the young men's uprising was to correct and renovate the current state of the country. However, it is regrettable that the foundation of their guiding spirit was the national innovation thought that was harbored by outsiders and was absolutely incompatible with the national polity. In short, the army led by the Emperor's own troops was an unacceptable rebellious act in the current action, and it is unbearable to hate. The military is determined to self-examine, self-warn, and rectify military discipline, in order to live up to the Emperor's trust and the people's trust. (6th Allied Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Part of the 1st Division to Depart for Manchuria Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Lieutenant General Itagaki, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, and Colonel Seishi, Chief of the 1st Section, who came to Tokyo on the 30th of last month to attend the Chief of Staff Conference, have been meeting with key figures in the Central Army for days to report on the military situation in "Manchukuo," the special situation in the Soviet-Manchurian and Mongolian border areas, and the state of the Soviet Red Army's deployment in the Far East, and to propose expanding the Kwantung Army's equipment, increasing investment in Manchuria, and immigrating to Manchuria as countermeasures. They also conveyed the Kwantung Army's opinions on this issue. The opinions of the Central Army are also consistent with this, and it has been decided to increase the Kwantung Army's equipment in the next few years from Showa 12 (1937) onwards, in order to ensure that the defense of "Manchukuo" is foolproof. Colonel Sakanishi is now scheduled to return to his post alone at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th, after completing his official duties, to report all the details to Commander Ueda. According to the Kwantung Army's opinion, expanding military equipment, investing in Manchuria, and immigration policy are important matters for the national policy towards Manchuria, so the government should actively assist investment in Manchuria. Regarding the immigration issue, it is ideal to make the annual increase of Japan's population of 1 million people as immigrants to "Manchukuo." (6th Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army announced that a part of the 1st Division will depart from Shinagawa, Shibuya, Kofu and other places on May 8 to travel to Manchuria. (6th Allied Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Determined to Uphold the Acquired Victory with Great Courage</p>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech tonight, broadcasting to the whole country, stating that Italy's victory was a victory of civilization over barbarism, and that no country in the world could force Italy to abandon what it had conquered. The various ethnic groups in the "Black Lion" country (i.e. Abyssinia) were all convinced and happy to live and work under the Italian tricolor flag. This fact is obvious and very clear. The military officers and tribal chiefs of Abyssinia have been defeated and those who fled have fled. These people are exhausted and powerless and we need not worry about them. Looking back to October 2nd of last year, when the Italian-Abyssinian War was about to begin, I solemnly declared that I would do my best to prevent the Italian-Abyssinian War from degenerating into a European War. I deeply believe that if European peace is threatened, it will be the collapse of the entire Europe. I have fulfilled this promise. However, I must also solemnly declare that we have achieved significant victory with great courage and unwavering determination. We are now prepared to maintain victory with the same spirit and determination, lest it be lost.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then expressed his condolences and gratitude to the soldiers who fought in East Africa and the workers who served in foreign lands. His concluding remarks were, "Revolutionary Black Shirt comrades, men and women compatriots across the country, our journey has now completed a stage, and we should continue to move forward with a spirit of peace, and with confidence and determination to bravely face the tasks ahead. I now shout long live Italy, may this sound reach Africa, where all soldiers can hear it! Long live Italy!" (5th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) The government received a telegram this afternoon from General Badoglio, the Senior Italian Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force in Italian East Africa, stating, "This Commander-in-Chief has led the victorious troops into the capital of Abyssinia at 4:00 p.m. today." At 5:30 p.m., the whistles in Rome rang together, and the bells throughout the country rang to announce the general mobilization of citizens. In an instant, flags were immediately raised at the ends of houses, and all work was stopped. Fascist Party members all rushed home to change into black shirt uniforms, and within forty minutes, they gathered at designated locations. At that time, the streets were full of Fascist Party members rushing east and west. Public buses, business cars, and all other vehicles were also full of party members. Soon, only women and children remained in the vehicles, because all men, even ten-year-old children, had to participate in the general mobilization, and had already gotten out of the cars and left. At that time, there were special guards stationed in front of the British Embassy and Consulate, including many military police and soldiers, for protection. Traffic nearby was temporarily blocked. The number of guards in front of the embassies and consulates of other sanctioning countries has also been increased to prevent accidents. By 7:00 p.m., the crowds in front of the Palazzo Venezia had gathered to an unprecedented extent. Fascist groups held flags and sang patriotic songs, waiting for Prime Minister Mussolini. At 8:00 p.m., the Prime Minister came out to the balcony with General Badoglio's telegram and read it to the public, and gave a speech saying, "I now declare to the Italian people and the world that the war is over and peace has been restored. Since the start of the war, after seven months of fierce fighting, I am now able to declare this to the public. I cannot help but feel touched, and I am also proud of it. Moreover, this peace is our peace, that is, peace in the style of ancient Rome. The peace in the style of Rome can be summarized in one sentence, that is, Abyssinia belongs to Italy. This sentence is simple and clear, and it is also unwavering. I mention it here because it is absolutely necessary." Tonight, the enthusiastic rejoicing of the Italian nation is unprecedented. Fascist groups from all over the world gathered at designated locations to listen to the Prime Minister's broadcast speech (see previous telegram). (5th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Claims Complete Sovereignty Should Be Enjoyed, Not Tolerating Other Countries' Interference</p>
<p>(Rome) It was learned today that the House will meet on the 9th of this month to pass a bill declaring Italy's complete sovereignty over Abyssinia's capital. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Semi-official sources recently explained Italy's views on the Italian army's occupation of the Abyssinian capital, stating that the Abyssinian state no longer exists, its government has been overthrown, and its unified situation has been eliminated. At this point, it is merely a part of Italian territory. Since the Abyssinian Emperor's departure, Abyssinia has had no government, and Italy can hardly consider even nominally attempting to establish a new government in the future. In the future, Italian troops may continue operations in southern Abyssinia, but their nature will be to clear out the remaining enemy and stabilize the area, which is not comparable to war. Even from the perspective of the League of Nations, Abyssinia no longer exists, so there is no need to protect it, and its mission is over. This is the general outline. As for the details, Italy is willing to consult with Britain, France, and even the League of Nations to protect various interests, but Italy refuses to discuss the legality of conquering Abyssinia under any circumstances. Since Abyssinia completely belongs to Italy, Italy will refuse any attempt to divide it in the future. Semi-official sources finally stated that Italy's outward expansion policy will not end with the conquest of Abyssinia but has only completed the first stage. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>All Government Offices in the City Replace with Tricolor Flags, Military Rule Reduces Terror</p>
<p>(London) Today, Italian troops officially entered Abyssinia's capital with flags flying and music playing, thus ending the terror in the capital. It took the Italian army seven months and three days of fighting to occupy the capital. The first person to enter the city was the Governor of Rome, Botti, leading the procession, as Botti served as an infantry officer in the army. Following him was General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the East African Army, riding a white horse and leading a squadron of Carabinieri, followed by a regiment of grenade launchers, and then a squadron of Eritrean soldiers. Then, trucks loaded with soldiers and military supplies arrived one after another. By afternoon, 25,000 Italian soldiers had entered the city. As the Italian troops entered the city, 50 airplanes soared in the sky. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Abyssinia's Capital After seven months of war, the Italian army finally completely occupied Abyssinia's capital today. Italian Commander-in-Chief Badoglio ordered the city to be entered at noon today. It was led by 20 motorcycle escorts, followed by nine small tanks, and then the main force of the large Sabauda Division, traveling in many military vehicles. After that came Commander-in-Chief Badoglio, leading generals and staff members in the headquarters vehicle, with native soldiers providing cover on both sides of the road. Badoglio went directly to the Italian embassy to set up headquarters. By 4 p.m., all government offices in the city had been occupied. The Italian army's appearance was very impressive. There were very few Abyssinians along the way. The palace is now flying a single-color flag. In the evening, the Abyssinia's Capital station was also occupied by Italian engineering teams. Abyssinia's Capital is now under military rule, and the chaotic situation of the previous days has suddenly stabilized. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Abyssinia's Capital The bandits and scattered soldiers in Abyssinia's Capital have stopped looting. These people have hidden their rifles, raised white flags, and cheered to welcome the Italian troops entering the city, and saluted with the Fascist salute. When Italian soldiers sang and cheered as they passed through the streets, the Abyssinians showed no signs of resistance, so not a single shot was fired. Most of the new districts of Abyssinia's Capital have become rubble fields with smoke rising everywhere. Many extremely exquisite buildings were reduced to ashes. Many shops were looted, and many houses were burned down. The streets were filled with various broken items and war relics. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>(London) According to Mr. Martin, the Abyssinian ambassador to London, the Abyssinian King will probably place his family in a monastery in Palestine and then go to London to fight for Abyssinian justice. The Abyssinian Queen is very weak due to hardships and will probably never appear in public and live permanently in a monastery near Jerusalem. Mr. Martin is now afraid that his two sons have been killed by robbers while trying to preserve their property in Abyssinia's Capital. He has not heard from them for a month. Rome now believes that half of the Italian soldiers fighting in East Africa will be left there as colonists, and the Italian authorities will send their families to East Africa. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Officials told the Associated Press today that the U.S. government will deal with Italian-occupied Abyssinian territory in the same way, based on its repeated policy of not recognizing territory seized by force. Although a government spokesman declined to comment, senior officials said the East African situation was no different from the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. The U.S. will continue to uphold the Stimson Doctrine. However, the government must observe how the Italian army governs Abyssinia before making a final decision. On the other hand, the U.S. has very little stake in Abyssinia, so its policy may vary with circumstances. The attitudes of European countries must also be considered. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) With the Italian army entering Abyssinia's Capital and the Abyssinian King going to Palestine, the League of Nations expects Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to demand that Abyssinia now belongs to Italy. When the League of Nations Administrative Council discusses the Italian-Abyssinian dispute next week, the Italian representative to Geneva, Aloisi, is rumored to refuse to sit on the same seat with the Abyssinian representative. Aloisi will probably claim that the Abyssinian government no longer exists, so where does the Abyssinian representative come from? This statement is simply asking the League of Nations to recognize Italy's victory in East Africa. Everyone expects the Italian representative to raise this issue in a sharp manner. However, the League of Nations Administrative Council will not take severe action. According to speculation, the Administrative Council will find a compromise solution. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

It is rumored that Switzerland and Spain will also join the meeting later to make a final decision on this issue. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to political figures, the British government is now considering proposing a reorganization of the League of Nations because the League of Nations' handling of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has failed. The method is no more than the following two points: 1. Divide the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles into two. 2. Mutual assistance obligations should be designated to regions and no longer have universal characteristics. The method is to divide the countries of the world into several regions. Countries participating in a mutual assistance convention in a certain region bear the obligation of immediate military mutual assistance within that region, while countries belonging to other regional conventions only provide advisory opinions. Some political figures believe that once the above reorganization method is realized, the constraints borne by Britain will only be limited to Western Europe. It is rumored that the British government has not yet made a decision on the reorganization issue and will study it in the long term after the Italian-Abyssinian issue is truly resolved. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) People seem to be more interested in the future of the League of Nations. Letters to newspapers discussing this issue are endless. Most people consider the possibility of improving the League of Nations to avoid its demise. The famous writer Baron Charne Huhan sent a letter to The Times, saying that the reason why the League of Nations failed to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute was that the Covenant was not a real agreement, but a plan that was not fully understood and was not sincerely accepted. Lord Lothian also sent a letter to The Times, advocating the deletion of Articles 10 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, saying that this move could enable the League of Nations to use great power to seek peace, because there is no threat after the mediation proposal. The Daily Telegraph praised Prime Minister Baldwin's reply to the British League of Nations Association delegation: "We must clarify the position of the League of Nations." The British League of Nations Association plans to hold a general meeting at Albert Hall on Friday to proceed with its proposal to continue sanctions against Italy. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian war in East Africa is now over. How about the future of the League of Nations and Abyssinia? All the world's capitals and newspapers have various speculations about it.</p>
<p>London All London newspapers attach importance to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's statement that Abyssinia will always belong to Italy. At the same time, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have decided to continue or expand the sanctions. The Huikai Daily and the Daily Express both support this proposal, but the Daily Mail and the Daily News advocate that Britain withdraw from the League of Nations. Other comments can be found in the following Reuters telegram.</p>
<p>Paris If the Italian Prime Minister's remarks contain the meaning that he wants to solve the fate of Abyssinia himself, then this view will conflict with the policy of the current French government, and it is even more contrary to the doctrine of the new government that will be formed every day. The French centralized authority expressed its opinion that what is needed now is a strategy that takes into account both military reality and legal status. If Italy takes Abyssinia as its protectorate, imitating France's actions in Morocco, it may be an acceptable solution, but it cannot go further and annex it.</p>

<p>Willing to Establish Authority Throughout Abyssinia, Absolutely No Intention of Coveting Egypt</p>
<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently made an important speech to Mr. Price, a special reporter for the Daily Mail, explaining that Italy's policy has absolutely no intention of hindering Britain. The purpose of this speech is to extend a hand of friendship to Britain. He said, "The Italian government has absolutely no intention of coveting Egypt. As far as I am concerned, Egypt is an independent country in the Mediterranean and not a country on the African continent. Italy and Egypt have always had a good friendship, and we should maintain friendly relations in the future. As for Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Palestine, Italy has no political interests in these places." The Prime Minister then said, "Italy's wishes in terms of colonies have been satisfied after the conquest of Abyssinia. In the future, Italy can be among the 'satisfied' countries." Referring to the Abyssinian peace issue, the Prime Minister said, "For the benefit of all related countries, it seems most appropriate for Italian authority to be quickly established within Abyssinia. As for the terms of peace, they should be based on the spirit of ancient Rome and should not come out of a malformed peace. We advocate that the Abyssinian issue must be resolved once and for all, because the sacrifices, bloodshed, and money we have made for Abyssinia are all borne independently, without relying on others. The solution to the Abyssinian issue should take this into account. However, if Italy's friendly countries are engaged in economic enterprises in Abyssinia, we will definitely not close the door to them." At this point, Price asked whether the so-called friendly countries included Britain, France, and other sanctioning countries. The Prime Minister replied, "Yes." He also said, "Once the countries of the world learn about our country's true financial strength, they will be surprised, just like they learned about the truth of our military strength. The discussion of the reorganization of the League of Nations is now urgent. Italy is ready to come out to help. I personally think that the League of Nations can continue to exist, or even needs to exist. However, the responsibilities it bears should be commensurate with its power, and the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant should be adapted to the needs of various countries and the situation in European countries." Referring to the Rhine River issue, the Prime Minister said, "After the German army entered the Rhine River area, Italy adopted an absolutely reserved attitude because the sanctions were still in the implementation period. Italy is now ready to help, so that the major countries of Western Europe can establish sincere and practical understanding, because these countries must eventually reach an agreement, otherwise, once the war starts, the result will be the complete overthrow of the entire European culture."

<h3 id="e86">Japanese Army in North China Expanding a Division <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Applying Wartime Establishment with 16,000 Personnel, Barracks Being Built in Tianjin, Qin, Chang, Tang</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The strengthening of the Japanese garrison in North China has recently been decided. Originally, the Japanese military planned to dispatch 5,000 elite soldiers from the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 8th Divisions from within the country, in addition to the 2,800 infantry and artillery troops currently stationed there, and form a mixed brigade, still stationed along the Peining Railway line and the special areas of Tianjin and Beijing in accordance with the Boxer Protocol. Unexpectedly, last month, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, Nagami, returned to Japan to attend the Division Commander's Meeting, bringing with him a proposal from the Japanese Commander Tada Shun, stating how important the situation in North China was and how urgent the anti-communist military affairs were. In order to protect all Japanese rights and interests in North China and the safety of overseas Chinese, it was necessary to expand the military strength to more than one division in order to provide thorough protection. At this time, Tada was still at the rank of Major General, and with the expansion of military strength, he hoped to continue to serve as commander, and at the same time, he could be promoted by one rank, so the wording was deliberately sensational. The proposal was actually passed and obtained the promise of the Japanese military, so the original intention was changed. After Nagami returned to Tianjin, he prepared a budget and sent Senior Staff Officer Ishii back to Tokyo, and presented it to the Japanese military when attending the Chief of Staff's Meeting. There is no problem in implementation. The number of soldiers in this division is 12,000 to 16,000, fully adopting the wartime establishment. The system is the same as that of the Japanese garrison in Taiwan. All mechanized, chemical, air-land tank, and special forces are included. In addition to the troops currently stationed there, the newly added soldiers should be around 13,000. Although the name is a division, the strength exceeds 20,000 people. They will still be selected from the elite troops stationed in Hiroshima, Utsunomiya, Tokyo, and Hokkaido. Not a single unit will be dispatched separately to avoid weak strength. The first batch of troops is scheduled to depart from Tokyo in early June and arrive in North China in mid-June. They will continue to arrive one after another and can complete the expansion by the end of June. At present, the Japanese military is rushing to prepare barracks. 700 new barracks are being built in the Limingzhuang area of Dongjuzi in Tianjin, divided into 27 places. Only bricks and tiles require more than 50 million cubic feet. The construction cost is 400,000 yuan. More than 1,300 Chinese and foreign workers are being gathered to rush the construction. About the end of June, a part can be completed. The occupied land belongs to Li Chun, the former Soviet Governor, and the Peining Railway Bureau. Although they promised to give a price, they have not paid a penny so far. There are also more than 40 acres of private land (the barracks occupy a total of 1,340 acres) that have also been occupied. In the future, negotiations will lead to the best outcome, and perhaps a lower price will be paid. In the Japanese concession, the building of the Xilai Hotel on Mingishi Street, with about 200 rooms, and the Gongli Hospital on Fukushima Street, with 100 rooms, have also been occupied by the Japanese military and are being repaired. They are planned to be used as garrisons for special forces. In addition, one barracks each will be found along the Peining Line in places such as Luanxian, Changli, and Liushouying. In Qinhuangdao, Nandasi, and Tangshan, new houses are being built next to the old barracks. All are limited to be completed next month. However, the purpose of the Japanese military to increase its troops is not to equip a strong force in eastern Hebei, but to enter and exit the Pinghan and Jinpu lines. Recently, the Japanese side has already expressed its intention in the diplomatic negotiations in Hebei and Chahar, requesting to station Japanese troops in Fengtai. A number of Japanese troops will also be stationed in Changxindian, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang on the Pinghan Road, and Yangliuqing, Jinghai, and Botouzhen on the Jinpu Line, saying that they are assisting in anti-communism. The authorities have not yet allowed this. However, with such a large increase in Japanese troops, it is impossible not to find a suitable garrison. Therefore, in the future, the stationing of troops in the above areas will still be impossible to reject. As for the newly appointed commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, Wanyilang Tashiro, he will arrive around June 15. Tada will return home around the 20th after handing over his post. Tashiro is a current division commander and one of the few China experts. He served as the Major General Chief of Staff of the Ueda Division in the Shanghai War. As for his experience, he is from Saga Prefecture and graduated from the 15th class of the Military Academy. In 1904, he was appointed as a second lieutenant of infantry, and graduated from the Army University. He served as the Chief of the China Section of the General Staff Headquarters, the Commander of the 28th Infantry Brigade, a military attache in China, the Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Expeditionary Army, and the Commander of the Kwantung Army Gendarmerie. In August 1934, he was appointed as the Commander of the Gendarmerie. In September 1935, he was appointed as the Commander of the 11th Division. He was awarded the fifth class merit for his meritorious service in the Russo-Japanese War. He was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Double Rays, Third Class Merit for his meritorious service in the Northeast and Shanghai wars. (5th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Truth About the Monetary Famine in Sichuan Province <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Due to Manipulation by Unscrupulous Merchants, Copper Coins are Lacking, People of Sichuan Hope for New Subsidiary Coins to be Shipped to Sichuan for Relief</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: The huge quantity, complex types, poor quality, and disparate prices of copper coins in Sichuan Province are unique in the history of coinage, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. From the second year of the Republic of China to the seventeenth year, a situation of copper coins flooding the market gradually formed. Subsidiary coins became worse and worse, and prices became more and more expensive. In the seventeenth year, due to the disputes over factory-made, mixed-plate, half-dollar and large-dollar silver coins, copper coins were temporarily valued by people. From the eighteenth year to the twenty-third and fourth years, the silver coin problem was resolved, and then a large number of copper coins suddenly appeared on the market. In the spring and summer seasons of the twenty-fourth year, one silver coin could be exchanged for 30,000 copper coins (that is, 150 pieces of 200-wen copper coins). Sichuan Province is not short of copper coins, which can be used as solid evidence. However, since the implementation of the new currency system, ordinary villagers have become accustomed to using hard coins and have gradually valued copper coins again. In addition, unscrupulous merchants have spread rumors and manipulated them, creating several different exchange rates in Chengdu and Chongqing and in various counties, using copper as currency to profit back and forth, which has led to the phenomenon of the current monetary famine in Chengdu. Since the 27th and 28th of last month, copper coins have almost disappeared from the Chengdu market. All money shops have removed their exchange rate signs and do not accept one-jiao legal tender. The silver and money general market in Anle Temple on Shuncheng Street has been closed for several days. As a result, public officials and those who pull carts and sell drinks are feeling great hardship. According to reliable investigations, copper coins (referring to the copper coins minted in Sichuan Province over the years) are not lacking in Chengdu and various counties. It is only because the value of legal tender has fallen due to rumors spread by unscrupulous merchants. All merchants and civilians who receive copper coins are unwilling to transport copper to the market and exchange them for legal tender. This is the crux of the monetary famine in Chengdu. According to Zhang Shaoquan, who used to work at the Chengdu Mint, the types and numbers of copper coins minted by the factory over the years have been found. A list is specially attached below. From this, a conclusion can be drawn: The number of small 200-wen copper coins currently circulating in Sichuan Province is at least 600 million pieces (including privately minted ones). In addition, the number of large 200-wen, 100-wen, and 50-wen copper coins is no less than 1 billion pieces. It is extremely contradictory that such a huge amount is suffering from a monetary famine. At this moment, knowledgeable people in Sichuan Province unanimously hope that the central government will quickly ship new subsidiary coins to Sichuan for relief. If they cannot be minted in time, various old copper coins can be temporarily allowed to circulate by discounting their prices according to their quality. After a certain period of time, they should be collected and destroyed as waste copper and strictly prohibited from being used, as a temporary solution. The types and numbers of copper coins minted by the Chengdu Mint from the second year of the Republic of China to the seventeenth year are listed below.</p>
<p>The above list shows the numbers reported by the factory. As for the coins privately minted during the garrison era of various military factions, there are no accurate statistics. (May 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Anhui, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang Discuss Joint Control and Marketing of Green Tea <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province sends personnel to investigate the sales situation; a total of two million yuan is needed for loans and relief; Liu Zhenhua writes to Huang Shaohong to request his leadership.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Zhejiang is an important tea-producing province, especially known overseas for its Pingshui green tea, which is welcomed in European and American markets. According to a survey by the Zhejiang Economic Investigation Institute of the Central Construction Committee, tea is produced in 63 counties within the nine old prefectures of Shao, Hang, Yan, Chu, Jin, Wen, Qu, Hu, and Ning. The total annual output is 318,474 dan, of which the seven counties under the Shao prefecture (namely the Pingshui area) produce the most, estimated at over 100,000 dan. Approximately 200,000 boxes are exported annually, each box containing 50 catties, with a value of about 10 million yuan based on 80 yuan per dan. Recently, due to the control and marketing of black tea in Shanghai by Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, tea merchants in Shanghai have implemented a suspension of foreign exchange bills to show their opposition, leading to a shortage of funds for tea merchants in various places to purchase tea. As new tea from Zhejiang Province is currently entering the market, tea prices have plummeted as a result, causing great panic among tea farmers. The Anhui provincial government believes that since Anhui and Jiangxi provinces have already provided loans and relief for black tea, and counties such as Xiuning and Shexian in Anhui Province, as well as Wuyuan County in Jiangxi Province, also produce large quantities of green tea, with annual exports of about 100,000 boxes, only one-third of Zhejiang Province's output. Therefore, they intend to further unite with Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces to continue providing loans to tea merchants and implement joint control and marketing of green tea for thorough relief. Anhui Construction Department Secretary Chen Yan was specially dispatched, carrying a personal letter from Liu Zhenhua, to visit Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong, Civil Affairs Department Director Xu Qingfu, and Construction Department Director Wu Tingyang, among others, to explain the process of Anhui and Jiangxi's joint control and marketing of black tea, the opposition of tea merchants to the suspension of foreign exchange bills, and future opinions on uniting Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces to control and market tea to relieve tea farmers, or to establish a new marketing organization led by Zhejiang Province. Huang, Xu, Wu, and others all expressed deep sympathy. However, Zhejiang Province must first conduct a detailed investigation into the production and sales of Pingshui green tea. Wu Tingyang convened relevant personnel from the Construction Department for a discussion. Although the required bank loan is estimated to be around two million yuan, Xu Qingfu can negotiate with the Farmers Bank of China for a loan, which should not be a problem. It was decided to send Zhu Huiging, Director of the Bureau of Commerce and Industry, to Shanghai today (the 5th) to investigate the sales situation of Pingshui green tea. Regarding fundamental solutions, a Pingshui Tea Industry Improvement Center will be established to guide tea farmers in all aspects of improved cultivation and tea-making methods. An application has been submitted to the National Economic Commission for an appropriation of funds to subsidize the expenses, and concrete measures have been discussed for cooperation with Zhejiang Province for improvement. The commission has agreed to allocate 14,000 yuan for the establishment of the improvement center. Currently, the site urgently needs to be determined, and the Rice and Wheat Field Director Mo Dingsen, tea expert Wu Juenong, technician Lu Yunfu, and others have been dispatched again to cross the river to Shaoxing Shengxian on the morning of the 5th to re-survey the location for setting up the improvement center.

<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Province Encourages the Establishment of Shipping Routes to Southeast Asia <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Construction Department drafts measures pending verification and implementation; approval for five years of exclusive navigation and provision of subsidies.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong provincial authorities have vigorously promoted shipping administration and construction in recent years. In the first three-year plan for shipping construction in the province, it was decided to first complete the province's shipping route network and then establish routes to other ports. However, in Southeast Asia, due to the large number of overseas Chinese, passenger and cargo traffic has relied on foreign commercial vessels. The local overseas Chinese, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, are eager for the provincial government to quickly complete direct shipping routes between Guangzhou and Southeast Asia, in order to recover outflowing profits. Currently, Ding Peilong, Director of the Guangzhou Port Authority, has adopted the opinion of Cui Longwen, a resident of Nanhai County, to expedite the establishment of commercial vessel direct routes to various Southeast Asian ports, and has submitted it to the Construction Department for deliberation and implementation. The opinion believes that the key to implementing shipping operations is capital. If the government finds it difficult to raise funds temporarily, it can encourage the people with various conveniences to demonstrate its promotion. Overseas Chinese in various ports are known for their patriotic enthusiasm and should be able to actively raise shares to operate the shipping business. After review, the Construction Department believes that it can be adopted and has immediately drafted measures to submit to the provincial government for implementation. The measures are as follows: Announce rewards to the people for revitalizing the shipping industry, especially focusing on overseas Chinese, so that they can raise funds themselves to operate shipping routes to Southeast Asia. The reward measures are divided into two items: (A) Approval for five years of exclusive navigation. (B) From the date of commencement of navigation until the end of the five-year exclusive navigation period, the government will issue subsidies annually, tentatively set at 35% of the ship's management expenses. The service measures are divided into six items: (A) Vessels receiving government subsidies should be subject to government command and use in case of national emergencies. The amount of supplementary payment during the period of use will be determined separately. (B) Responsible for carrying mail; detailed rules for freight charges will be formulated separately. (C) The government will send a number of navigation and machinery trainees to serve and practice on board. (D) Without government permission, the vessel shall not be transferred or sold to foreigners. (E) When repairing, repair at domestic government or merchant-operated shipyards as far as possible. (F) Passenger and cargo fares must be submitted to the government for approval and shall not be increased or decreased without authorization. (May 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e91">Tianjin and Beijing Abolish Native Opium Shops <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: When Song Zheyuan was in charge of Chahar Province, he established a Clearance Office in Chahar Province to handle the prohibition of opium. Ten opium shops (called "Da Yan") were established, with a certain amount of tax stamps affixed to each tael of opium, implementing public sales of native opium and promoting it to the Beijing-Tianjin area of Hebei Province. During transportation, soldiers of the 29th Army were dispatched to protect it. Promotional agencies were established in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places. The military expenses of the 29th Army were mostly allocated from this income. Since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, Chairman Song Zheyuan specifically cited the precedent of Chahar Province and appointed Qi Wei to organize the Beijing-Tianjin Clearance Office in Beijing. All relevant opium prohibition regulations were based on the original ones in Chahar Province, modified in light of the local conditions in Beijing and Tianjin. The office was officially established on January 12th. At the same time, a Tianjin Office was established in Tianjin to handle all matters. All organs such as the Hebei and Beijing-Tianjin Opium Prohibition Supervision Office and the Opium Prohibition Committee Inspection Office were immediately abolished, and their files were taken over by the office. According to Qi Wei, "The main purpose of the office's opium prohibition is to implement strict prohibition and suppression measures in three steps. The first step concerns highly addictive drugs (such as heroin, morphine, Jindan, etc.), which will be absolutely and strictly prohibited. The second step concerns narcotic drugs (such as opium), which will be prohibited within a time limit, and will be carried out through methods such as persuasion (for non-smokers under 30), compulsory detoxification (for smokers over 30), and the establishment of detoxification hospitals, suppressing private opium smuggling, and restricting commercial operations. The third step is to implement strict prohibition when the time limit in the second step expires." Since its establishment, the office has successively promulgated four types of regulations: "Implementation Rules for Suppressing Private Sales and Restricting Commercial Operations," "Opium Prohibition Rules," "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Pharmacies and Drugstores," and "Tax Regulations." In February, it began soliciting merchants to operate opium shops. The capital for the establishment of a pharmacy must be at least 50,000 yuan. The capital for drugstores is divided into Grade A: 6,000 yuan, Grade B: 3,000 yuan, Grade C: 1,500 yuan, and Grade D: 800 yuan. In addition, it is also necessary to pay deposit, special permit fees, business license fees, and other items. The opium sold in pharmacies in Beijing mostly comes from the Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, and along the routes, as well as Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Suiyuan. The Clearance Office stipulates regulations according to the situation in various places and the distance of the journey, affixing tax stamps of 10 cents to 50 cents for each tael of opium. Most of the opium in drugstores comes from pharmacies. As of the regulation time, about ten pharmacies and nearly a hundred drugstores have been established in Beijing and Tianjin. After the establishment of pharmacies and drugstores, in order to seek unified management, the office set up checkpoints in the four suburbs of Beijing, as well as at various stations, airports, and postal inspection offices, dispatching investigators, inspectors, and undercover agents to be stationed separately to inspect passing passengers and mail, and announced to opium smugglers to register and affix tax stamps for selling opium within a time limit. Anyone who violates the regulations and sells or carries opium privately will have the opium confiscated and stored in the public treasury established by the office. The offenders will be sent to the Pacification Commissioner's Office for interrogation. Since the implementation of public sales of opium in Beijing and Tianjin, due to the special local environment, large-scale private drug trafficking organizations established by Japanese and Korean ruffians are everywhere, and the authorities cannot prohibit them, resulting in a huge impact on opium shops. According to the regulations, opium in shops must be sold only after tax stamps have been affixed, and it is not allowed to open lights to serve customers. Opium addicts must also be sold opium based on permits. However, opium shops in Beijing and Tianjin, due to the impact of private foreign trafficking organizations, have poor business and have behaviors that violate the regulations, such as selling private drugs, opening rooms to serve customers for smoking, and selling drugs to opium addicts without permits, in order to attract customers. For this reason, the Clearance Office has negotiated with the Japanese side to ban Japanese and Korean private trafficking organizations, but the result is still ineffective. Recently, in order to seek its own interests, the office pretends not to know about the violations of the regulations by the shops and allows them to do whatever they want without restriction."</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying, the Mayor of Tianjin, heard that the Beijing-Tianjin Clearance Office's performance in prohibiting opium was not good, and that opium shops had behaviors that violated the regulations, and expressed his dissatisfaction. He had proposed to abolish the Clearance Office or replace the director Qi Wei. It was finally decided to abolish all opium shops in both places first, and then discuss other issues. As for whether the agency that replaces the shops to sell opium will be operated by the government, Qi Wei and others are currently discussing it in Tianjin. The section chiefs of the office in Beijing have been meeting for days to discuss the progress of the office and various measures to deal with current affairs. It is said that the office may change its organization. Regarding the anti-smuggling part, the Investigation Office has been abolished since the 4th, and the Inspection and Undercover Offices have been merged. As for the other departments, they are currently under study. (May 5th)</p>

<p>Zhang Yougen's house in Nantang Township, the seventh district of Punan, was robbed at midnight on the 30th of last month. Now, Zhao Zanchen, the commander of the bandit suppression guerrilla detachment, has investigated and arrested three bandits, Zhang Fujin, Monk Gu, and Zheng Zuogen, in Qijiadun, according to his second squadron's third platoon leader, Lü Zhongfu. A gun and 17 bolts of cloth were seized in the bandits' den. They confessed that they were the stolen goods from Zhang Yougen's house. Yesterday, Commander Zhao submitted a document to the district headquarters to send the bandits for interrogation. The 17 bolts of cloth seized in the case have been notified to the victim Zhang Yougen to come to the headquarters to claim them. At the same time, the team was ordered to strictly pursue the escaped bandits.</p>

<p>The area of Yangxu outside Dongdou in this county has more than a thousand hectares of wasteland. Because the soil is saline, it cannot grow rice or wheat. It only grows weeds every year, which is a pity to abandon. Now, Xu Xiangsheng from this county believes that the saline soil is most suitable for cotton planting. He specially introduced a Nantong cotton merchant to Haizhou a few days ago to lease 15 hectares of Yang's family wasteland in Yangxu. Starting this year, a pilot cotton planting farm will be established there, with a temporary six-year contract. If it can be successful, it will be gradually promoted.</p>

<p>Residents in the Sanliqiao area of Beitang in Xiyi recently complained that the river water there had turned black and smelled bad. They had previously sent a letter to the First District Office, which forwarded it to relevant factories around Wuqiao East and West, such as Lixin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Xiexin Woolen Mill, and Liyong Paper Mill, asking them to improve the water discharge equipment. The Xin Yun Inspection Team and the County Government's Construction Bureau and Public Security Bureau also went to inspect. Lixin had already changed the water pipe to the inner bay and blocked the bay mouth. Xiexin had also added a water purification pool to store and release sewage. However, the water still smelled bad recently. On the afternoon of the 4th, residents in the area rushed to the Beitang Town Office to request a solution, but no solution was found. They then carried the flags of the Public Health Corps and rushed to the Pujiqu Bridge riverbank, filling the river with sand, mud, stones, yellow stones, and broken bricks to build a dam. The persuasion of the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau was ineffective, and they continued to block the river on the 6th. Chen Yuchu, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, personally went to dissuade them, and they stopped in the afternoon. However, the area is a vital transportation route between Chengxi and urban and rural areas. Once it is blocked, the public is panicked. Yesterday morning, the County Government specially convened an emergency meeting with the directors of the Public Security and Construction Bureaus, the director of the First District, the mayor of Beitang Town, and the County Chamber of Commerce to decide to order the mayor of Beitang Town to first restore the river transportation and to have the Construction and Public Security Bureaus jointly investigate the source of the black water and find ways to improve it. The disturbance was finally resolved.</p>

<p>The Tianzhang Silk and Satin Store on Dongda Street in the city has been in operation for 12 years since Gu Muyong took over. Business was usually good and credit was also good. Various deposits amounted to more than 40,000 yuan. In recent years, affected by rural bankruptcy, the price of goods has fallen, and profits have been eroded, resulting in a tight turnover. The store owner Gu Muyong was unable to maintain it. He left for Shanghai a few days ago. On the 5th, he sent a fast letter to Lu Zhongling, the person in charge of the store, Lin Songming of the Silk and Cloth Association, etc., stating that he was in Shanghai and was going to commit suicide by jumping into the sea in Gaoqiao, with losses of more than 30,000 yuan, and that the business would be closed for settlement. In the afternoon, depositors rushed to withdraw their deposits or cut out goods. The partners were not authorized to make decisions and dispersed in the evening. The store's inventory was sealed by the association. The Chamber of Commerce will hold a meeting on the 6th to discuss the handling method.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Jiaxing: Sericulture in the Four Suburbs is Approaching <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Sericulture in the four suburbs of Jiaxing is approaching. This year, due to the cold weather, some of the silkworm eggs distributed by the guidance centers in various districts have not been able to hatch, causing the villagers to argue with the distribution centers. As a result, the silkworm harvest this year is scarce. The early batch is currently in the first molt. Due to the weather, the molting is uneven. It is expected that the silkworm harvest will be much less. As for the leaf market, the sprouts are not growing well, and the leaf pulp is not thick. In addition, the price of mulberry leaves has been cheap for years, so many mulberry trees have been dug up and planted with other crops. The land this year is actually less than in previous years. As a result, the price of leaves has risen. In the past two or three days, the selling price per dan has risen from more than 50 cents to about 70 cents. According to insiders, if the weather is good and the sericulture is good, the price of leaves will definitely rise again, but it will not be as expensive as in the previous years. Silk merchants are registering with the Silkworm Silk Control Association to prepare for cocoon collection. However, due to the issue of mixed collection (cocoon merchants plan to collect both local and improved varieties in each factory), they are still arguing.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Ningbo: Truth About the Double Corpse Case in Zhenhai <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the discovery of two floating corpses of young men and women outside the Nanmen Gate in Zhenhai, the reporter went to Zhenhai to investigate the truth in order to understand the truth. The main cause of death of the deceased is as follows: Ge Shengjie from Gejia, Zhuangqiao, Cixi, is sixty years old. His wife is Ms. So-and-so. His mother is still alive. He has seven children. The family is reunited and has not yet separated. His son, Qi Min, married Sheng Jinmei, the second daughter of the Sheng family in the area, five years ago. They were very loving and had a three-year-old son. However, Qi Min was honest by nature and had many misfortunes. Therefore, he was often depressed. Last year, through the introduction of relatives and friends, he went to work as a partner in the Yifeng Herbal Medicine Bank in Shanghai. However, Qi Min's income was very small and he could not take care of his family. His grandmother, Ms. So-and-so, was very snobbish and discriminated against Qi Min and his wife, treating them differently from other granddaughters-in-law, and often criticized them. Therefore, the relationship between the sisters-in-law was not very harmonious. His father, Shengjie, often ordered him to subsidize the family. Qi Min was in such an environment, truly a case of crying and laughing, and he was always at fault. Therefore, the thought of being tired of the world arose. Last month, Jinmei received an invitation from her sister's husband in Shanghai to stay in Shanghai for a short time. Qi Min also went to visit. The sisters met and confided in each other, deeply feeling that the future was bleak and the heart to be tired of the world was more decisive. Qi Min drafted three suicide notes, addressed to relatives, embraced his son and took his wife, falsely claiming to go out, and took a boat to Zhenhai. Walking to Qingshui Pu, they threw the child into the river center. The husband and wife tied each other together and jumped into the river at the same time. The child's body was discovered in Qingshui Pu on the morning of the 27th. The bodies of the man and woman were washed by the tide and discovered in Lianzi Daotou the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I recently read a news item on the third page of the report on April 30, "The Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee is internally divided into four groups." I was very surprised. The association has been established for more than three months, and the alleged organization and address are inconsistent with the facts. I think it is a misunderstanding of the transmission. I hereby write to you and hope to correct it. The first group, the third section of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, May 2.</p>
<h3 id="e101">From Huainan Road to Chaoxian County <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Jiewen</p>
<p>Huainan Coal Mine Produces 1,500 to 1,600 Tons Daily; Huainan Railway Transports with Utmost Agility</p>
<p>Huainan Coal Mine was initially a privately-run enterprise, producing approximately 700 to 800 tons of coal daily. Since the National Government's Construction Committee took over, five additional mines have been successively opened, increasing daily output to as much as 1,500 to 1,600 tons. Subsequently, for transportation convenience, the Huainan Railway was built from Tianjia'an in Huaiyuan County within the mining area, passing through Hefei and Chaoxian County, directly reaching Yuxi Town on the Yangtze River opposite Wuhu, traversing western Anhui for a length of 220 kilometers. After its completion in January of this year, not only could coal be rapidly transported to the Yangtze River within a day, transferred by steamship to be sold in Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiujiang, Wuhan, and other places, but also the transportation in various counties of central Anhui has greatly benefitted from it. I recently visited the road and also visited the famed Xianren (Immortal) Cave in Chaoxian County, known throughout Anhui, with no known end. I record my impressions as follows:</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Yuxi Town: The Huainan Road starts from Huaiyuan, passes through Hefei, Chaoxian County, and Hanshan, ending in Wuhu. Its transportation importance relates not only to commerce and culture. To facilitate joint transport with the Jiangnan Company's Nanjing-Wuhu Road, a ferry terminal was specially set up on the Yangtze River in Wuhu, equipped with ferries to transport passengers. I departed at dawn on the 2nd, and the ferry took 40 minutes. Upon landing, since it was not yet time for the train to depart, I lingered briefly in Yuxi. In the past, Yuxi was a major hub for sailing vessels in central Anhui, with a forest of masts, creating a majestic scene. Hence, past warlords and politicians all regarded the customs posts and transit taxes of this town as lucrative positions. However, no one cared about construction. Now that Huainan Road has its terminal station here, the station, warehouses, and ferry terminals are being actively constructed. A small-scale power plant has been completed and is already providing electricity. Technical engineers, laborers, and small businesses, such as restaurants and stalls, that have sprung up in response, number no fewer than several thousand. The future prosperity and importance of Yuxi can be foreseen.</p>
<p>What I Saw in the Third and Fourth Class Cars: I boarded the train at 8:30 AM. In addition to two third-class passenger cars, there were as many as seven or eight fourth-class cars for the poor. The rest were open coal cars, mostly empty. Except for a small amount of goods like bamboo brooms, the fourth-class cars were packed with overflow passengers, standing for long distances, exposed to wind and sun. Although there were only two third-class cars, the total number of passengers was less than ten. The economy, frugality, and resilience of the rural people can be seen here. The dining car business cannot be promoted because of this. A pot of tea costing five cents might only be bought by one or two passengers in third class. Bread, eggs, and rice are only frequently purchased on Nanjing-Shanghai trains. The carriage arrangement is similar to other lines. However, the porters are not trained and move awkwardly, lacking vitality. The authorities of the road seem to need to pay attention to this point. Starting from Tianjia'an Station and reaching Wuhu Terminal, the route passes through Datong, Huainan Mining, Shuijiahu, Zhuxiang, Xiatangji, Luoji, Shuangdunji, Hefei, Cuozhen, Qiaotouji, Jiongyanghe, Zhonghan, Chaoxian County, Lintou, Dongguan, Tongchengzha, Shenjiaxiang, and Yuxikou, for a total of twenty stations. The journey takes a total of ten hours and thirty-five minutes. From Yuxi to Chaoxian County, it only takes three hours and twenty-eight minutes. In the past, traveling between Wuhu and Chaoxian only relied on small boats, requiring departure in the morning and arrival at dusk. The roadbed throughout the entire route is extremely solid and uses heavy-duty steel rails. Therefore, the train travels smoothly, unlike the Nanjing-Wuhu section of the Jiangnan Company, which is like sitting on a ship at sea, making people uncomfortable. It takes ten years to grow trees, but willows easily provide shade. The willows planted along the roadside are expected to become a forest in three years, providing natural protection for the roadbed.</p>
<p>Chaoxian County: Small Town with Green Mountains. Chaoxian County has been famous for a long time in history, formerly known as Nanchao. Tang the Successful imprisoned Jie here. The county town is only seven li in circumference, surrounded by mountains and water, exuding an ancient charm. The streets are paved with stone, so there is no mud even in heavy rain. The newly built asphalt roads are not as naturally clean. Although the houses are mostly old, each has the beauty of gardens. Therefore, the annual value of flower production within Chaoxian town alone has reached over 100,000 yuan, not counting other plums and loquats. Chaoxian crabapples have long been famous for their color and taste. However, wealthy families regard them as a type of ornamental plant, and no effort is made to increase production, which is a great pity. Woniu Mountain in the city originally had many flowers, fruits, and trees. Last year, with the donation of Zhang Zhizhong from the Central Military Academy, it was developed into Niu Mountain Park. "A small town cradles a green mountain" captures the poetic richness of Chaoxian's scenery. Looking far from the mountain, surrounded by thousands of mountains, one can see a corner of Chaohu Lake. The lake spans hundreds of miles, with the water and sky merging into one color, boundless. Aquatic products are abundant, but there is no method for unified production, capture, and sale. Because it is freshwater, the fish and shrimp are delicious and without a fishy smell. The whitebait is particularly outstanding, as white as silver, without scales or bones. There are plans to can it for export, which is a type of industry.</p>
<p>The Depth and Distance of Xianren Cave. Chaoxian County is originally located in the midst of thousands of mountains. Silver Screen Mountain, Phoenix Flag Mountain, Lion Mountain, and Cloth Drum Mountain all possess natural beauty. "Mountains surround Chaoxian" is a true depiction of Chaoxian County. The reason why I made Chaoxian County my destination on this trip was actually attracted by Xianren Cave and the peony on the cliff of Silver Screen Mountain. The mountain is about forty li from the city. Young boys and girls lead donkeys to greet tourists outside the north gate at a very low price. Riding in the deep mountains and green fields is like being in a painting. The interest is something that city people cannot imagine. Every time we joyfully sing, the mountains echo, and only in the realm of nature can this true beauty and true joy be found. After more than two hours, we arrived at the foot of the cliff. Looking up, the cliff is dozens of zhang high. A peony plant grows upside down in the shade of the cliff. Legend has it that the number of flowers blooming is a sign of abundant or scarce water and harvests. People in Anhui deeply believe it and regard it as a sacred object. During the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the cliff flower bloomed nine times. This year, the flower bloomed four times, all regarded as a sign of worry-free harvests. The entrance to Xianren Cave is a li from the foot of the cliff, unfathomable. It is said to extend for dozens of li. Although it is just conjecture, its depth can be known. Those traveling with me did not prepare in advance and were pressed for time. They only explored about a li and did not dare to go deeper before returning. Strange rocks grow upside down in the cave, and spring water drips down. A month ago, a Western missionary named Walden from the American Methodist Episcopal Church in Wuhu and his friends went to explore it, carrying grenades and pistols to defend against snakes, beasts, and poisons hidden in the cave. They set off firecrackers as they went, reaching a distance of more than ten li, but the road ahead was still uncertain, and they eventually returned midway. This mysterious cave is gradually attracting the attention of curious people. Someone has initiated the organization of a large-scale expedition to explore it to the fullest.</p>
<p>The Living Stone of Jingtingshan. On the way back, we passed Wang Qiao Cave, located north of Wanjia Mountain, where Prince Qiao is said to have become an immortal. The cave is tall and large, like the city cave of Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing, and dozens of zhang long, passing through the mountain for passage. There are hundreds of stone carvings and statues in the cave, but all have lost their heads, destroyed by superstitious rural farmers. We then passed by Jingtingshan, taking water from Jingtingshan Spring to brew tea on the spot. When tested in a cup, it protruded more than a meter above the cup's rim without spilling, as rumored. Perhaps it contains special minerals. The spring water is clear and pure, and stone crabs can be easily caught. There is also a type of "living stone," which is even more incredible. Upon retrieval and inspection, it is a fine stone that has congealed into the shape of a swallow, about the size of a five-cent coin, with a round hole in the middle. Tiny crawling insects live in the hole. Once the head and fine feet of the insect start to move, the stone is carried along. The name "living stone" is based on this. The greatness of heaven and earth is truly full of wonders. After catching over a hundred of them and placing them in a bottle, we hurried back to Wuhu along the original route. However, it is unknown how long the living stones will live after being transplanted. (May 4th)</p>

<p>Visit to Leith-Ross Delayed Departure by Five Days; China Industrial Associations Hosted a Dinner Yesterday</p>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of Guangdong Province, was originally scheduled to go to Nanjing by night train on the 5th. However, due to the presence of British financial advisor Sir Frederick Leith-Ross in Shanghai, Mr. Feng visited him and provided Mr. Ross with materials needed for his investigation in Guangdong, thus postponing his departure. Last night, the China General Chamber of Commerce, in recognition of Mr. Feng's hospitality to the Guangdong and Guangxi Investigation Group in Guangdong, specially invited Mr. Feng through its Secretary-General Wang Zhisheng for a welcome dinner at the Hua An Building on the eighth floor at 8 PM. Secretary-General of the Bankers Association Lin Kanghou and Superintendent of Jianghai Customs Tang Hai'an were also invited to accompany. All members of the Guangdong and Guangxi Investigation Group, including Hu Xiyuan, Cai Shengbai, Xiang Kangyuan, Wu YunChu, Pan Yangyao, and over fifty others, were present. Hu Xiyuan, as chairman of the group, gave a welcoming speech, stating that the Guangdong and Guangxi Investigation Group received much hospitality and guidance from Director Feng in Guangdong, providing the group with many conveniences. The report on the investigation in Guangdong is currently being compiled and will be completed soon. At that time, Director Feng will be invited to facilitate further cooperation between the industrial and commercial sectors of Guangdong and Shanghai to jointly develop China's industry. A simple feast was specially prepared to thank him for his hospitality. Feng Rui then stood up to thank them, stating that he was willing to follow the leading figures in the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai and work together, hoping to receive their guidance and support at any time. The banquet ended at around 10 PM. It is reported that Mr. Feng is scheduled to fly to Nanjing by China National Aviation Corporation plane today to visit the central government, report on the construction situation in Guangdong Province, and visit Minister Kong to request instructions on the sugar tax issue. He is scheduled to come to Shanghai on Sunday to invite people from the financial sector in Shanghai to discuss the mortgage of Guangdong construction bonds, and then accompany Tang Hai'an to Guangdong.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Associated Press Interview with Chang Mills on the Reasons for King Haile Selassie's Departure <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>To Reside in Jerusalem as a Private Citizen</p>
<p>According to the China Press, Mr. Mills, a correspondent for the Associated Press who recently left Abyssinia, gave a speech at the American Women's Club yesterday afternoon, stating that in his opinion, there are five reasons for King Haile Selassie's abandonment of Addis Ababa, all of which are purely personal: The King felt that the people would attribute the blame for the defeat to him and might choose someone else as their ruler. The King did not want to suffer the humiliation of being forced to abdicate under Italian rule. The King was truly afraid that his life would be lost at the hands of the Italians. He had several near misses during the war. Mr. Mills said that one day when he was with the King in Taixi, he personally witnessed Italian bombers dropping bombs without warning. The bombs fell very close to the King, but he was unharmed. The King did not flee, but grabbed a machine gun next to him and shot at the enemy plane to defend himself. The King felt that the League of Nations and Britain had plunged Abyssinia into the abyss. The King felt that continuing the war would be difficult to win because the Italian army had tanks, airplanes, poison gas, and other sophisticated new weapons, while the Abyssinian army only had old-fashioned rifles and knives. For these five reasons, he reluctantly fled. Both the King and Queen are devout Christians and now wish to live peacefully in the Holy Land. Mr. Mills believes that the King will enter the Coptic Church and the Queen will enter a convent. He believes that this "King of Kings" could not find a place to live in Abyssinia, so he went to Jerusalem to find it. The situation in Addis Ababa today is chaotic and the overall situation is even more dangerous because ignorant Abyssinians cannot distinguish Italians from other white foreigners. Moreover, the Abyssinians are fanatical and superstitious, and they have a deep hatred for white people. Abyssinian women are very brave, and the courageous actions of the recently deceased American Mrs. Stafford are also admirable. When Italian planes bombed the hospital, Mrs. Stafford completely moved the wounded out of the hospital. Less than three minutes later, the hospital was destroyed by bombs. The King's ancestor lived in Jerusalem. The King and Queen also visited the area several years ago, so they are not strangers when they arrive. The King always carries the Ark of the Covenant when he goes out. The Ark has been by his side during this war. The Abyssinians all believe that the King has survived numerous dangers because of it.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Eurasia Airlines No. 2 Small Aircraft Forced to Land in Ningxia <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Pilot Yan Duzhou Slightly Injured, Fuselage Slightly Damaged; Passengers Safe, Lanzhou-Baotou Route Still Flying as Usual</p>
<p>According to China Eastern News Agency, the Eurasia Airlines No. 2 small aircraft flying the Lanzhou-Baotou route was forced to land due to weather conditions while approaching Ningxia Station on the 1st of this month. Except for the pilot Yan Duzhou suffering a slight injury to his nose and slight damage to the fuselage, fortunately all four passengers were safe. The Lanzhou-Baotou flight is still flying as usual today. The company is scheduled to send a Junkers Ju 52 large aircraft on the 8th to investigate. China Eastern News Agency reporters specially visited Mr. Zha Zhenhu, the secretary of the company, yesterday morning, and received the following detailed report:</p>
<p>Forced Landing Near Ningxia: The Eurasia Airlines Lanzhou-Baotou route is scheduled to fly one flight every Wednesday and Saturday, returning to Lanzhou and Baotou on the same day. At 8 AM on the 2nd of this month (Saturday), the Lanzhou office of the company dispatched the Eurasia Airlines No. 2 small aircraft as scheduled, piloted by national pilot Yan Duzhou. It took off from Gongxingdun Airfield in Lanzhou. At 9:40 AM, when flying near Ningyuan, the weather suddenly changed, with strong winds and dust, causing the flight to lose direction and had to be forced to land in the area.</p>
<p>Pilot Slightly Injured, Passengers Safe: The location where the aircraft was forced to land was only five kilometers away from the airfield outside the west gate of Ningxia New City. Because the ground was uneven, the aircraft was slightly damaged after landing. The pilot Yan Duzhou was slightly injured in the nose by the impact. Fortunately, all four passengers were safe. After the Ningxia Station office learned of the situation, they immediately sent a car to carry the four passengers and mail into the city. Yan Duzhou was immediately admitted to the hospital for treatment of his injuries.</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Baotou Route Still Flying as Usual Today: The No. 2 small aircraft is currently being repaired by the Ningxia Aircraft Factory. It is expected to be completed within a few days. Because the vibrations caused minor damage, it can still be used after repair and there is no need to claim compensation from the insurance company. Today (Wednesday), the upstream flight on the Lanzhou-Baotou route is still flying from Lanzhou at 8 AM as usual. The company is scheduled to send a Junkers Ju 52 large aircraft from Shanghai to Ningxia on the 8th (Friday) to study the cause of the forced landing.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yangzhuang Tea Industry Opens Green Tea Drafts Yesterday <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Chairman Visited Minister Wu Yesterday to Request Relief; Qian Chengxu Telegraphed that He Will Return to Shanghai from Nanjing Today</p>
<p>The Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association, accepting the advice of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, decided to open green tea drafts. However, the loan for Anhui and Jiangxi black tea must wait for a proper resolution before being opened. Samples were sent for trading by various tea firms yesterday morning. The Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting visited Minister Wu yesterday to request relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegraphic Notice of Opening: The Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association telegraphed to the Chambers of Commerce and Tea Industry Associations in Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, Wenzhou, Changshan, Suian, Weiping, Huzhou, Shaoxing, etc., stating, "This Association has repeatedly received advice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the instructions from the Municipal Government, and will open the market on the 6th, and at the same time, drafts from various places for green tea will be honored. However, due to the unresolved issue with the Transportation and Sales Committee regarding black tea from Anhui and Jiangxi, the drafts will not be honored for the time being. Shanghai Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association humbly submits."</p>
<p>Opening of Trading: The member tea firms of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association, including Zhongxin Chang, Hongyuan Yong, Yongxing Long, Zhenhe, Yitai, Yuanfengrun, Gongshengyong, Shenyuan, Rendeyong, Shengchang Sheng, Yilong, Xietai, Tongtai, Xielong, and fourteen others, began honoring all overdue drafts for various green teas yesterday morning, and sent samples of the new green teas from Suian, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and other places that have been listed to various foreign export companies dealing in tea for trading.</p>
<p>Black Tea Issue: The black tea production areas are Qimen and Zhide in Anhui, and Ningzhou, Hekou, Wuning, and Yushan in Jiangxi. The new tea is also about to be listed. Chen Yizhou and others from the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association are currently negotiating with Cheng Zhenji, Director of the Transportation and Sales Committee, to resolve the Qimen tea transportation and sales issue. Qian Chengxu, a representative sent by the National Chamber of Commerce Federation to petition in Nanjing and Anhui, telegraphed from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday, reporting that he is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Request for Relief: The Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting visited Minister of Industry Wu Daquan yesterday to request relief. His original letter is as follows: "To His Excellency Minister Wu Daquan, with utmost respect, the case of the Anhui Provincial Government's control over the transportation and sales of Qimen black tea, which affects the business of tea firms in Shanghai, was reported by the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Association in February and April through telegrams and presented to Your Ministry, requesting consultations with the Anhui Provincial Government to properly address the issue, so as to preserve the decades of overseas trade of the industry. Subsequently, Your Ministry's April telegram stated that an immediate telegram should be sent to urge a prompt resolution and that the control and sales measures should be submitted for review. Although no notification has been received from Your Ministry as to whether the Provincial Government has handled the matter as directed by the telegram, in reality, the situation is becoming increasingly pressing, making the tea firms feel that there is no business to conduct. For example, tea firms used to lend money to tea producers as their business. When the Provincial Government decided to control Qimen black tea, its decision document stated that the unemployment and debts of export tea merchants (i.e., tea firms) must be taken into account. The Anhui Provincial Government's reply to the Chamber of Commerce in its winter telegram in March stated that measures were being carefully studied and would not hinder the lending of tea firms, and requested that this be communicated to dispel any doubts. Its expression of not competing with the people for profit was particularly earnest. However, while claiming to be carefully studying the matter, it established the Transportation and Sales Committee in Anhui Province on April 1. Moreover, tea producers who had already received loans from tea firms but did not want to receive official loans were also forced to comply. The Anhui Provincial Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee's April telegram claiming that more than 1.9 million yuan had been loaned was an implicit indication of its efforts to take over the lending business. Tea firms feel disappointed that the Anhui Provincial Government's words and actions contradict each other, and that it first comforted them and then reversed its decision. However, in order to preserve the commercial market, they sent representatives to Anhui Provincial Government to propose a government-transported, merchant-sold approach. According to the tea firms' report, this approach was verbally approved. However, the Anhui Provincial Government's April telegram differed from the verbally approved approach. Only a sales group was established under the Transportation and Sales Committee's General Sales Office to recruit tea firm personnel to handle the business. The main body of transportation and sales remained with the province, and tea firms were merely employees. Thus, the tea firms' lending and transportation business was entirely taken over by the province. The province's so-called control is actually a euphemism for state-owned operation. Unable to bear this any longer, the tea firms stopped honoring all types of notes issued previously that were due for payment on April 23. The reason for this action was that the current loan was originally granted with the special permission of Anhui Province, stating that it would "not hinder" the tea firms. Now that the province has gone back on its word, the responsibility should be borne by the province itself, and since the tea firms are on the verge of forced closure, they are in fact unable to bear this burden. For half a month, the various tea-producing counties in the interior, which relied on these notes for circulation, have felt a sense of financial stagnation once the notes were stopped from being honored. Moreover, because of the impact of the closure of tea firms, green tea exports have also been affected at the same time. Therefore, Anhui's current measures are not only related to the survival of the Shanghai tea firms, but also to the rise and fall of the national tea export industry. If Anhui Province relies on its abundant public power and does not leave any room for tea firms, it is feared that the officials and merchants will become the snipe and clam, while others may become the fisherman, leading to the complete destruction of the only remaining tea export industry in the so-called Qimen black tea control policy. Today, the concept of economic control and industrial control is prevalent. The so-called control is not intended to exclude private enterprises and replace them with state-owned enterprises. The province's claim to control Qimen black tea, while ending up with government transportation and sales, is inevitably leading down the wrong path. Moreover, it is causing people to misunderstand the meaning of the concept, claiming that the various types of control advocated by current trends are the prelude to nationalizing all industries, especially fearing that the false claims will spread, causing great anxiety in the business community and further shrinking investment. This is what I repeatedly considered and dared not fail to directly report to Your Excellency. I, Zuoting, humbly serve as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and it is my duty to do so. I have earnestly advised the industry to open its market and resume operations in order to avoid a chain reaction in this spring's tea market. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce sent telegrams to the National Economic Commission and the Municipal Government, requesting them to consult with Anhui Province to adopt the compromise measure of government transportation and merchant sales proposed by the industry, so that tea merchants' businesses can be preserved. All avenues for appeal have been exhausted, but no results have been seen, causing me to feel ashamed and fearful. Having no other choice, I respectfully submit this letter to Your Excellency, earnestly requesting Your Excellency to exert all your influence to help, and to consult with Anhui Province to adopt the original compromise proposal of the industry immediately to properly resolve the issue, which is in the public interest. With utmost respect, I wish you good health."</p>

<p>Fengpu and Qingning Both Telegraphed Shanghai Reports Yesterday</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Fengpu steamer, with a loading capacity of 1,911 tons and 800 horsepower, capable of traveling ten nautical miles per hour, was originally sailing the Yangtze River. It was dispatched this time to Shierxu to load a large quantity of Huai salt for unloading within the Yangtze River. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30, the steamer departed from Haizhou fully loaded with Huai salt. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to</p>
<p>Jiangzi Port, about thirty-five li from Haizhou, the steamer, due to its heavy load and shallow water, ran aground suddenly outside Jiangzi Port. The hull became stuck in the port shoal. The shipowner, Chang Sheng, attempted to free the ship himself, repeatedly reversing the engine, but to no avail. The water at the grounding site was only sixteen feet deep at most, leaving the shipowner with no recourse. He telegraphed Shanghai yesterday morning,</p>
<p>reporting the grounding situation and requesting advice on waiting for the tide and rescue measures. The company received the report in the afternoon and telegraphed instructions to wait for the rising tide and try to get the ship off the shoal. If the grounding was too severe and self-rescue was impossible, the cargo should be unloaded to reduce the draft. Therefore, they are currently waiting for further telegrams. Furthermore, according to continuous reports, at the same time as the Fengpu steamer encountered grounding outside Jiangzi Port, there was also the</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Strives to Ban Smoking and Destroys Over 300 Opium Dens; General Reporting of Smokers Scheduled to Begin on May 10; Government Employees Given Two Months to Reform and Quit</p>
<p>The general reporting of smokers in this city is scheduled to begin on the 10th of this month. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is actively striving to eliminate opium addiction within the district and has destroyed over 300 opium dens in recent days. Government employees of party, government, and military agencies are given a two-month deadline to quit. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gradually Eliminating Opium Dens</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau considers the secret private opium dens throughout the city, which supply opium for smoking, to be the source of opium addicts, and even a place where bandits are harbored. Therefore, the Bureau ordered all district offices to make efforts over several months, resulting in the destruction of opium dens and the dismantling of organizations that sell red pills, morphine, and other drugs in various districts such as Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Fahua, Pusong, Pengpu, Gaoqiao, Longhua, etc., totaling over 350 locations (excluding those with gun licenses). To completely eliminate all secret private opium dens, the Public Security Bureau encourages people to report them and, in addition to keeping the identity of the informants confidential, provides appropriate rewards. If it is discovered that any government officials are protecting the situation, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Supplementary Registration</p>
<p>Since the Military Affairs Commission issued instructions to the responsible anti-drug agencies to allow smokers to register supplementally to give them a final chance to reform, and the Songhu Garrison Command handed over convicted and unconvicted opium offenders to the Public Security Bureau after a written pledge and allowed them to register supplementally, all the smokers in the city have been applying to the Smoker Registration Section of the Fourth Division of the Public Security Bureau and the district offices in recent days, because the general reporting work is about to begin. The number of applicants exceeds 2,000. No fees or fines are charged. As for the second phase of license renewal for registered smokers, the number has also exceeded six-tenths of the total registration number.</p>
<p>Reporting of Government Employees</p>
<p>The general reporting of smokers throughout the city is scheduled to begin on the 10th of this month. Various implementation plans for reporting smokers will be announced in the coming days. As for government employees of party, government, and military agencies, they will be strictly reported as a model for the people in order to enforce the anti-drug policy. The reporting methods are as follows: The reporting period is set for two months. During the first month, each employee must submit a written pledge stating that they do not smoke opium or use drugs, which must be stamped and certified by their direct superior. During the second month, the competent authorities will compile and forward the pledges to the General Reporting Agency. After the pledge, if it is discovered or reported and verified that they are drug users, they will be dismissed from their original positions or sent for punishment.</p>

<p>Zhou Qigang Gives Radio Speech on Overseas Chinese Affairs</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Zhou Qigang was recently invited by the Ministry of Education to be a lecturer on public education at the Ministry. He delivered speeches on the Central Radio Station on April 29th and May 2nd, titled "The Problem of Our Overseas Chinese Affairs." The original manuscript is published below:</p>
<p>Today, at the invitation of Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, I am here to broadcast on the scheduled topic, "The Problem of Our Overseas Chinese Affairs." This problem has a very broad meaning, and I have published several parts of it over the years. Now, I will combine the old concepts and new thoughts and divide them into four sections: 1. The Definition of Overseas Chinese Affairs; 2. The Chinese People's Understanding of the Issue of Emigration; 3. The Form of Overseas Chinese Administration; 4. The Key to the Survival of Overseas Chinese, and present them to everyone.</p>
<p>The Definition of Overseas Chinese Affairs</p>
<p>The issue of Overseas Chinese affairs has already become a central issue in the world's evolution for hundreds of years in the international arena. Just look at the various countries' efforts to strengthen their military, develop shipping lanes, increase tonnage, expand territory, seize markets, extract raw materials, and even so-called island trusteeships and mandated territories, etc. All the open and covert struggles are derived from this issue. However, in the past, our country's history has either been self-righteous or self-destructive about the issue of Overseas Chinese affairs, mostly believing that there is nothing outside of China, and that everyone except the Chinese are barbarians. General political and economic issues have long been ignored, so when discussing the issue of Overseas Chinese affairs today, we must first analyze the definition of Overseas Chinese affairs. The term "Overseas Chinese Affairs," in its general sense, refers to the administrative affairs that a country handles regarding the emigration of its own people to foreign countries and the immigration of foreign people into its own country. However, the management of emigration differs in each country in the world. Some countries do not focus on managing the emigration of their own people, but on managing their colonies. Some manage the emigration of their own people while expanding their territories. Some have no territories at all and only manage their own immigrants. Our country's Overseas Chinese affairs, of course, belong to the latter. Because of our country's national strength and various other reasons, although many foreigners have immigrated to China, we have not implemented appropriate management. Article 1 of our current Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's organizational law states: "...manages the emigration and protection of its own people," which is also particularly different from others. In various countries, so-called emigration either involves having a colony before having colonial actions, or a country having an immigration policy before having immigration management. However, our emigration and management are not like this. It is because there has long been the fact of "people's emigration" that Overseas Chinese organizations have been established recently. This is especially special. Therefore, we can only talk about managing our own Overseas Chinese at present, so our scope of Overseas Chinese affairs is biased in terms of the definition of Overseas Chinese affairs.</p>
<p>The Chinese People's Understanding of the Issue of Emigration</p>
<p>I said earlier that the most important evolution over the past hundreds of years in the world is the issue of international emigration. Let us think, as far back as the invasion of Europe by the Goths and Vandals, the migration of Huns and other Asians into Europe, the expansion of Turks from Asia to Asia Minor, the colonization of England by the Normans, the wars of the Romans and Alexander, the long march of Greeks along the Mediterranean coast, the exploration of the New World by Europeans across the Atlantic, the scramble for islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans by France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Britain, Japan, and the occupation of coastal islands and borderlands of our country, and as recent as the Eastern Philippine War, the turbulence of the international situation is a strong expression of the colonial issue. So-called international events and world issues are all concentrated on the solution of colonialism. This is something that everyone can see. Looking back at our country's past history, not only was emigration not taken care of, but even in the Manchu Qing Dynasty, harsh punishments were used to absolutely prohibit citizens from moving abroad. At the same time, the general public also held a contemptuous attitude towards seeking a livelihood abroad. How strange is this? However, although our government and people have had such disregard for the issue of emigration in the past, the number of emigrants from our Overseas Chinese exceeds the number of emigrants from all other countries in the world, and the spread of Overseas Chinese businesses has also achieved considerable success. This is indeed a characteristic of our country's commerce. Regarding this point, I have also published the reasons for its existence, which I will not repeat here. However, what we should pay attention to is that modern countries and modern nations must not ignore the issue of emigration if they want to maintain their survival, because a country and a nation cannot close themselves off in the midst of turbulent world trends, let alone seek a way out in the international arena in order to achieve a balance between people and resources. Therefore, we should recognize the Overseas Chinese issue that arises from emigration is an important policy that every country should use to deal with people and resources in the international arena. The past attitudes of self-righteousness and self-abandonment should be thoroughly reformed. Originally, the emigration of Overseas Chinese also occupies an important position in international politics and economics, which has been recognized by historical facts. The most serious and difficult problem in the world is the unemployment problem of surplus labor. From a general international political and economic point of view, the issues of emigration and unemployment are mutually related. This close relationship is naturally formed because the outward movement of the people of one country can reduce domestic unemployment and increase foreign financial resources, so countries are fighting for the goal of "colonies and colonization." The issue of emigration has become an important focus of international politics and economics, but the overseas emigration of our compatriots and the colonizers who are fighting for colonies are completely different, because in international politics and economics, we not only have no danger of fighting, but also make peaceful and great contributions to the place of emigration. This important meaning of the emigration of Overseas Chinese should be paid special attention to and should be explained: the progress and prosperity of various businesses in the world are all based on labor. Before the nineteenth century, North America, such as the United States and Canada, South America, such as Chile, Brazil, and Mexico, and the rest, such as Australia and the South Seas Islands, were all barren lands that were left unmanaged. None of today's prosperity was achieved without using the labor of Overseas Chinese. Our compatriots have low wages, are hard-working, and can work tirelessly for the place of residence year after year, regardless of whether they are the hosts or the guests. This is the first meaning of Overseas Chinese emigration expressed internationally. Overseas Chinese not only contribute labor to the place of residence, but also export and digest our inherent great culture to the people of the place of residence. According to what I have observed in the overseas Chinese residence areas, especially the local culture in various places in the South Seas Islands, all contain important elements of Chinese culture, and the same Western culture, in its initial stage or even now, is directly or indirectly influenced by Chinese culture, at least making Chinese and Western cultures communicate and harmonize with each other. This is the second meaning of Overseas Chinese emigration expressed internationally. In the early stages of development of various countries and colonies, there is a feeling of too little population. Increasing the population is a natural requirement. Overseas emigration of Overseas Chinese provides for their needs, enriches their labor force, and promotes their development. Internationally, it regulates the density of the population and the equilibrium of labor supply and demand. This is the third meaning of Overseas Chinese emigration expressed internationally. From these three meanings, the emigration of our Overseas Chinese is beneficial to our country and nation, and it is also beneficial to the people of the world. Unfortunately, in the past, our country ignored the issue of emigration too much, so although there are so many people emigrating abroad, there is still no proper management and policy, and the general public in society also lacks a deep understanding of this emigration undertaking, which "exports labor to reduce the difficulty of social labor and sends capital internally to increase the economic lifeline of the country." Originally, a nation should have a spirit of courage and enterprise in order to stand on its own in the world. If it is still holding on to a state of shrinking, peace, fear, and depression, then there is absolutely no spirit of outward expansion. No wonder our territory and sovereignty are being taken away day by day. Look at how Japan values this issue of emigration. There is no need to talk about the various efforts of its government. Just look at the societies organized by them and the publications exploring the issue of emigration in their society. There are so many. We are really dwarfed by them. Our country's past isolation from the issue of emigration certainly has political and historical reasons, but the social atmosphere also has a lot of influence. For example, life is considered difficult and humble when one leaves one's hometown, unfilial when one travels far from home, and disrespectful when one lives with barbarians for a long time... These are all obstacles to understanding the issue of emigration. In recent years, we have temporarily changed under the pressure of external forces. I hope that everyone will have a deep understanding of the issue of emigration from now on, and strive with peace and courage to enable the country and nation to achieve the happiness of coexistence and common prosperity in the world. This is the meaning of recognizing the issue of emigration. (To be continued)</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Spring Cocoon Lending Syndicate of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in 1925, the Shanghai General Office and the Hangzhou and Wuxi Branch Offices started lending for cocoon harvesting simultaneously yesterday. Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to be on the market. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lending for Cocoon Harvesting Started Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Syndicate (inside the General Office of the Bank of Communications), and the Hangzhou and Wuxi branch offices (inside the Hangzhou and Wuxi branches of the Bank of China) started processing cocoon harvesting and lending yesterday. All manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who wish to borrow for cocoon harvesting can apply to the General and Branch Offices of the Syndicate, and must provide at least 30% down payment and a reliable guarantor in accordance with the Syndicate's regulations. The loan period is three months, the interest rate is 8.5%, and the application deadline is May 20 in Zhejiang and May 25 in Jiangsu. The committee organized by the Syndicate will review and approve the loans at any time.</p>
<p>Spring Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Are About to Be on the Market</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang: Cocoon markets in Shaoxing, Haining, and other places in Zhejiang are scheduled to open on May 18, and cocoon markets in Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places are scheduled to open on May 20. Cocoon markets in Wuxi, Liyang, and other places in Jiangsu are scheduled to open around May 25. Silk manufacturers and silkworm cocoon merchants have been very busy organizing cocoon collection agencies to prepare to start collecting cocoons in the past few days. This cocoon collection is divided into improved varieties and local varieties, but the output of spring cocoons in various places, the improved varieties account for seventy to eighty percent.</p>
<p>Various Silk Factories Prepare to Start Production</p>
<p>Since the banks and money shops jointly formed the Spring Cocoon Lending Syndicate and stipulated the lending methods, the banks and money shops that have not joined the lending methods will also follow the syndicate's methods.

The silk factories that have been shut down are repairing machinery and preparing everything. The current price of Chinese silk in foreign countries, the B-grade is about 700 yuan in Chinese currency, which is about the same as before.</p>

<p>The Factory Inspection Division of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in view of the extreme negligence of various factories in the city regarding boiler facilities, such as whether the boiler body is capable of withstanding the normal operating pressure, whether scale has accumulated inside the boiler, whether there are leaks in the boiler plates, and whether all gauges are accurate, lacks thorough inspections. Even when inspections are carried out, they are performed by mechanics lacking experience, so boiler explosions occur from time to time, which not only harms workers and factories but also disrupts the tranquility of the entire society. Therefore, when starting the second phase of factory inspection work, the division plans to first implement boiler inspections to reduce disasters and protect the safety of factories, workers, and the tranquility of the entire society. It is reported that the division will implement inspections in phases in accordance with the Factory Safety and Health Inspection Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, in order to ensure that all equipment in factories in the city meets safety and health standards. Regarding boiler inspection matters, drafting of inspection methods has now begun, and it is expected to start implementation in early next month.</p>

This time, in order to reduce expenditures, the Ministry of Industry, considering that the defense areas of the Fisheries Protection Office's various fleets are mostly in the seas of Zhejiang, agreed with the Zhejiang Provincial Government to transfer the original fleets of the ministry to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for use, and this was approved by the Executive Yuan. All relevant information has been reported in previous newspapers. Since receiving the order, Director Yuan immediately instructed internal staff to comply. As a result, on the 2nd of this month, the Haihong, Haigu, and Haiying ships were officially transferred to the representatives Jun Xiaoling and Gong Chen of the Zhejiang Provincial Government for acceptance. On the 3rd and 5th, the office's furniture and all other items were transferred to the fish market. It is heard that Director Yuan submitted his resignation at the end of last year, so this time the closing could be completed as scheduled, and it is also heard that the closing and transfer process went very smoothly.</p>

<p>The Southern "Nanhua" line of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company originally consisted of the Yuanheng, Lizhen, four new seagoing vessels, and the Anxing vessel, five ships in total, departing from Shanghai to Guangzhou every Sunday and Wednesday. However, the Bureau found that departing on Sundays was inconvenient for guest customs declarations, and the frequent trips of the vessels meant that the time spent docked in Shanghai was very short, and the inspection work was also rushed. Therefore, for the convenience of guests and inspection work, starting from May 1st, the departure schedule was changed to every Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, departing from Shanghai. The Gongping vessel was also assigned to join the schedule, so that each vessel could spend an extra day docked in Shanghai for inspection. Therefore, the actual number of trips was not reduced. As for the "Xinming" vessel, which was originally a Northern route vessel of the Bureau, it had previously been rerouted to Fuzhou due to the Tianjin ice floes. Now that the Tianjin Haihe River has returned to its original state, the "Xinming" vessel has resumed the Northern route as before. The Shanghai-Fuzhou route has been taken over by the Yushun vessel, and the Shanghai-Fuzhou route has not been suspended.</p>

Starting from today, the registration of creditors will continue. All unregistered creditors are requested to bring their creditor certificates to the Chamber for verification and registration before May 22nd, and to obtain a registration certificate and voting ticket so that they can attend the meeting on time to discuss matters.

<h3 id="e131">Continued Trial of Assassination of Japanese Sailor; Mysterious and Unpredictable Content <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Ye Haisheng Admits Everything and is Willing to Accept National Law; Zhang Chen Proves that Ye Haisheng was Framed</p>
<p>Yang Wendao and Ye Haisheng (nickname "Little Guangdong"), Guangdong natives accused of shooting and killing Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Baole An Road at 9:00 PM on November 9th last year, have already been publicly tried once by the First Special District Court. This was reported in previous newspapers. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division, together with Assessors Feng Shide and Xiao Xiefei, formed a collegial panel in the First Court to continue the hearing. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru also attended to perform his duties. Municipal Government Secretary Zhang Tingrong and Section Chief Huang Hua of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Third Section also attended to observe. The Japanese Naval Headquarters in Shanghai also sent several officers and soldiers to listen. In addition, there were no fewer than a hundred onlookers. The police station lawyer Ru Bao Yi first reported the names of the people who had been summoned to testify, and then said that the defendant Ye Haisheng had written a statement in the police station after the previous trial, which was more detailed than his previous confession in court. According to him, he and Yang Wendao met when Yang was the chairman of the Chongshun Mutual Aid Society. Later, Yang successively organized the Tongyi Coordination Association and the Tongren Coordination Association, with Yang as the chairman and him as a member. The killing of the Japanese soldier was discussed twice in the Tongyi Coordination Association in early and late October. In addition to him and Yang, those who attended the meeting included Zhou Shiyong, the Korean Han Jieke, and another Korean whose name he did not know. On November 2nd, the five of them went out together to choose a location that would be convenient for committing the crime, in order to make it easier to escape after the crime, etc. He also presented a large drawing of the location where the incident occurred, as well as a page of drawings of the pistol bullets found by the detective at the scene after the incident, along with the various exhibits that had been presented previously. Next, two Chinese policemen, No. 2891 and No. 2864, reported the situation of finding Nakayama Hideo injured and lying on the ground, saying that at 9:03 PM on November 9th, while patrolling near the Japanese headquarters on North Sichuan Road, they were informed by passers-by Hu Xianghe and a 13- or 14-year-old girl that someone was lying in a pool of blood. They went to check and immediately telegraphed the police station. The court then summoned witness Hu Xianghe, who testified that he was a shoemaker. That night, he went to the Japanese shoemaker Takaoka's shop at No. 90 Baole An Road to collect debts. When he arrived at the entrance of the lane, he saw two rickshaws and a car parked there, and then heard a gunshot. He saw a person fleeing from the Fengle Lane, wearing black clothes and trousers. He did not notice whether the person was wearing a hat. He immediately entered Takaoka's shop to tell Takaoka, and then went out together to check, and found that the person lying on the ground was a Japanese sailor. He then went to the police station with the two Chinese policemen to report everything. The Japanese Takaoka then testified that he was playing a record player in the shop at the time, when he suddenly heard an explosion, and then Hu arrived and told him what happened, so he went out together to check the situation. The Japanese Navy Marine Corps medical officer He Jia Hui (transliteration) testified that he examined Nakayama Hideo's body. The bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the forehead. The wound and the recovered bullet were very consistent. (These two witnesses gave their statements in Japanese, so they had to be translated into English first, and then translated into Chinese by the translator Jiang Baoliang.) The court then summoned witness Yao Afu, the wife of Zeng Yuanzhi, who testified that she lived at No. 6 Fengle Lane, North Sichuan Road. She did not know Ye Haisheng at first, but only saw him when he came to her husband with a pistol to pawn it for 25 yuan, but the money was not borrowed. The loan application he wrote was torn up because of this case. At first, I thought that my husband's friend Zheng Weimin had reported it to the police station, but I later learned that it was Zhang Chen, because Zhang originally lived in my house. When my husband talked to Zheng about this matter, he could hear it. Chief Judge Qian then questioned the defendant Ye Haisheng. Unexpectedly, Ye not only wanted to overturn his previous confession in court, but also denied his recent statement written in the police station, saying that the words in the statement were fabricated by him, so if he were to repeat them, he would have forgotten most of them. In short, Nakayama Hideo was killed by him alone, and he was willing to state the process in court. He had been planning it for a long time, and because he encountered the sailor that night, he shot him. The books that were found were his, and the holes in the books were also dug by him. The court found his testimony strange, so he asked him, "The books belong to Yang Wendao, and the holes in the books were also dug by Yang. Now you claim that they are yours. On this point alone, it is clear that your testimony is difficult to believe. And you previously confessed in the police station that two Koreans wanted to hit the sailor, so why are you now admitting to the crime?" Ye then confessed that he was still confused when he wrote the confession in the police station, but now he feels that since this matter was done by me, I cannot falsely accuse others. Yang Wendao did not go with me either. The reason why I falsely accused others last time was because I hoped that I would not be severely punished and that I could still do something after I was released from prison. Now I am willing to accept the national law. That night, I was wearing black clothes and not wearing a hat, etc. When questioned, Yang Wendao still denied it, and said that the Tongren Association never had foreign members, and never invited Zhou Shiyong to the association to discuss any matters. The court then summoned Hu Xianghe and ordered him to identify whether there was anyone he saw fleeing that night among the two defendants. Hu repeatedly shook his head, indicating that he could not identify them, but Ye immediately said that although Hu did not see me that night, I did see Hu. At this time, the lawyer for the defendant Yang Wendao made some arguments, while the police station lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested to continue questioning the witnesses, and stated that Zhang Chen suddenly surrendered to the police station yesterday afternoon, saying that he knew the details of the case, and then took out a draft of a book and read it aloud. After he finished speaking, he presented the draft to the court. Then, Ye Atao, a tea servant from the Tongren Association, testified that Yang Wendao came to the association every day from one or two in the afternoon until midnight, without interruption. Ye Haisheng occasionally went to the association once or twice a month. There were more than 500 members in the association, none of whom were foreigners. At this time, Yang's lawyer had brought Zhang Chen to the court. Chief Judge Qian questioned him and learned that he was from Yaoyao County, Guangdong, and currently lived at No. 8 Chuan Gong Road. He did not know Yang. Because I knew the details of the case, I asked a friend surnamed Ye to write a report, which I originally planned to submit to the court. I had been friends with Zeng Yuan since childhood. After returning to Shanghai from Fujian in August last year, I often went to Zeng's house to chat until the end of the lunar year. A friend wanted to mortgage his property, so I went to visit him on December 10th to ask if he had any clients. Zheng Weimin was also at Zeng's house that day, and I saw them smoking and drawing a pistol on paper with a pencil. On December 29th, Zeng invited me to go to Zheng's house with him, saying that he was going to get money, but because he did not meet him, Zeng was quite upset. At that time, Zeng said that Zheng had asked him to go to the house of a Japanese officer to identify the pistol that killed the Japanese sailor, promising to pay him. Now Zheng is avoiding him and not paying him, which is hateful. But after Zeng returned, Zheng came immediately, so Zeng introduced us to each other. From then on, Zeng and Zheng talked without avoiding me at all. On January 4th, my brother sent a letter from Sichuan. Zheng took the envelope because he needed it. The next day, Zheng came to me and said, "There is a matter now. If you are willing to do it, you can get a reward of 4,000 yuan." I asked what it was. Zheng said that if he could report to the Japanese military headquarters that Nakayama Hideo was shot and killed by Ye Haisheng, Yang Wendao, and the Korean Han Jieke, he could get this huge reward. Zheng also said that Jieke had been captured by the Japanese, and he was willing to take me to identify him. Because I knew Ye well, I could not bear to do this, so I replied that I would consider it. Two days later, Zheng came to talk again, and asked me to go to the Japanese consulate to identify Jieke. On the way, I finally realized that it was dangerous, and returned alone and told Zeng about it. I also asked Zeng to return the envelope to Zheng. A few days later, I heard Zheng and Zeng say that they would think of another way. So they found Zhang Caiyuan (that is, the witness Zhang Kaiyuan mentioned in the previous report) and told him what they had told me, ordering Zhang to report to the Japanese military headquarters, etc. The court then asked Zeng whether Zhang Chen's statement was true. Zeng first said that Zhang's statement was all what he told him, and then suddenly attacked him, saying that Zhang originally lived in his house, but unexpectedly took advantage of his trip to Qingdao to go to a hotel room with his wife (that is, Yao Afu). He is a shameless and unscrupulous person, which immediately aroused the interest of the onlookers, who all smiled. Then Zhang Caiyuan was summoned for questioning, who said that Zhang Chen really wanted to get the reward and repeatedly came to talk to me, asking me to report to the police station as soon as possible. Because I had not seen the murderer, I hesitated, etc. The police station lawyer then requested to release Zhang Chen on bail. Chief Judge Qian, believing that there was no need to order bail, ordered that the hearing be continued on May 20th, and Yang and Ye were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Cut into Two Sections, Viscera Exposed; Autopsy and Coffin Preparation Yesterday, Seeking Claimants</p>
<p>At approximately 10:00 PM on the 5th, in front of the Chuan Gong Road intersection of the Songhu branch line, when the 150th Songhu local train was passing through the area, a man of approximately 30 years old, wearing a short blue cloth shirt and pants, and resembling a worker, suddenly ran onto the tracks, causing him to be cut in half at the waist by the train, with his viscera exposed, blood and flesh in a mess, and a tragic death on the tracks. Yesterday (the 6th), after the North Station Police Department instructed the local bailiff Xue Zhengming to report to the Shanghai District Court, Prosecutor Xie Lian was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. It was heard that it resembled a suicide by lying on the tracks. Because no family members were found, the body was handed over to bailiff Xue Zhengming to collect coffin expenses from the railway bureau for preparation, take photos, plant labels, and seek claimants.</p>

<p>At 3:00 PM, Bombs Exploded in Lujiabang, Starting a Fire; More Than Ten Fire Trucks Extinguished it in Twenty Minutes</p>
<p>In order to promote public awareness of disaster prevention, various Nanshi agencies held a fire drill at the intersection of Lujiabang Road and Xieqiao Road in Nanshi at 3:00 PM yesterday. Assuming that at 3:00 PM, the incident location was bombed and caught fire, the fire brigades of the east, south, west, and north districts of the city immediately dispatched more than ten fire trucks to rush to the rescue. The Traffic Division, Inspection Department, Ximen Branch, and nearby Tenth Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau all sent personnel to the scene to maintain traffic. The ambulances of the Sanitation Team rescued the injured from the fire in the raging flames. Thirty or forty members of the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th teams of the South Shanghai District Defense Corps, who lived near Lujiabang Road, all came to participate and maintain order without prior arrangement. The fire was extinguished in less than twenty minutes, and the scene was realistic. The Huadong News Agency reporter recorded the drill as follows:</p>
<p>Thatched Sheds Built in Advance; The Municipal Public Security Bureau built a thatched shed in the shape of a three-dimensional high-rise building at the intersection of Lujiabang Road and Xieqiao Road starting at 7:00 AM yesterday. It was made of bamboo and thatch, but the public was not notified in advance. At 2:00 PM, the fire brigades of the South Shanghai District were notified to gather at a certain place upon receiving a phone call at 2:00 PM. At 2:30 PM, Huang Tizhi, the acting director of the Ximen Branch, led the members of each precinct to maintain traffic at the scene. Tens of thousands of citizens considered it a spectacle and stood on the streets. Some even surrounded the rooftops, waiting for the disaster to come. The number of people exceeded 20,000.</p>
<p>A Loud Bang, a Bomb Exploded, and a Fire Started; At 3:00 PM, the police at a certain location on Lujiabang Road and Xieqiao Road suddenly heard a loud bang, and the location was set on fire as a simulation. They immediately reported it to the Ximen Branch by phone, which was relayed to the headquarters. Cai Jinjun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, immediately dispatched Inspector Dong Guangfu, Director Wu Fengwen of the Fire Prevention Division, and Luo Deming, a member of the Traffic Division, to the scene. The South Shanghai District Fire Brigade Joint Association also received the fire alarm phone call.</p>
<p>Fire Trucks Arrived Within Two Minutes; Xia Guoliang, the commander-in-chief of the South Shanghai District and the director of the Southwest District of South Shanghai, received the phone call and immediately dispatched three fire trucks from the Southwest District to the incident location on Xieqiao and Lujiabang Roads. He also telegraphed He Yongshou, the director of the Southeast District Fire Brigade of South Shanghai, Zhu Kuangshi, the director of the South District Fire Brigade of South Shanghai, Lu Jinlin, the director of the North District Fire Brigade of South Shanghai, and the Dongjiadu Fire Brigade of the Second District, etc. Within two minutes, more than ten fire trucks from each district arrived together.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Injured from the Fire; Each fire brigade, in the order of their arrival, found fire hydrants near the two ends of Xieqiao Road and the middle section of Lujiabang Road and aimed at the incident location to pour water. The fire trucks at the forefront also raised high-rise ladders and poured water from above. More than ten fire trucks fired from near and far, extinguishing the fire within five minutes. Many men and women who were burned by the fire were rescued from the houses inside the fire, and the Sanitation Team rescued them with swift means and wrapped them up well in the ambulances.</p>
<p>Completely Extinguished in Twenty Minutes; At that time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau Inspection Department, Fire Prevention Division, Traffic Division, Ximen Branch, and all precinct stations were at the scene to maintain traffic order, so there was no looting during the fire. More than 30 members of the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th teams of the South Shanghai District Defense Corps, who lived near Xieqiao Road in Lujiabang, also automatically participated in maintaining order. Therefore, under the joint efforts of all parties to maintain strict prevention, the fire was completely extinguished in less than twenty minutes, at 3:20 PM.</p>
<p>Realistic Scene, Satisfactory Results; During the drill, the residents on both sides relied on the guidance and maintenance of the police of the Public Security Bureau, and the order was very good. The scene was realistic. After the drill, the members of each district fire brigade also listened to the instructions of the Director of the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau and the directors of the Fire Prevention and Traffic Divisions, and recognized that the disaster prevention actions of each district fire brigade were rapid, and that they could also cope with any eventuality. The results were very satisfactory, and the citizens who participated in the disaster prevention were instilled with the meaning of disaster prevention. At about 4:00 PM, the mock play ended.</p>

<p>Zhao Han, a native of Zhejiang, lives in a shack on Qingyun Road, Zhabei, in this city, and has been working as a leatherworker. However, he has been unlucky and has suffered repeated setbacks. Until recently, he had no business at all and often had no food. Out of desperation, he went to a temple in Zhabei, intending to shave his head and become a monk, but he was rejected by the temple and returned dejectedly. However, he had no way to make a living for the time being, and he was about to sit and wait for death. In his anxiety, he could not help but feel resentment. At about 11:00 AM yesterday, he privately cut off his genitals with a leather knife in the shack, hoping to kill himself. However, he did not die immediately and instead felt unbearable pain, crying out loudly and alarming his neighbors, who rushed to see what was happening. They then learned the whole story and reported it to the police, who hired a car to take him to the hospital for treatment. His condition is very critical, and it is very pitiful.</p>

<p>Zhao Firmly Claims Xue Planned Extortion; Court Orders Retrieval of Case Files for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>Xue Zhenyi from Xuzhou, aged 31, was arrested in April of the 21st year of the Republic of China for attempted murder of Hai Zongqi, residing at No. 111 Pushi Road. He was found guilty by the Special Second Court and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. During the trial in the Tang Jiapeng assassination case last year, the convict Zhao Guangfu reported that Wang Xinggao and Gu Zhuxuan had incited murder. When Gu appealed to the High Court, Zhao testified that Xue Zhenyi, a prison lawyer, and Zhu Jincheng, among others, had planned to extort money from Gu. Now, Xue has been released on parole. Based on Zhao's testimony on October 2nd of the 23rd year, he believes Zhao deliberately damaged his reputation. He hired a lawyer and filed a private prosecution with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. Yesterday at 9 AM, Judge Chen Pusheng presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant, Zhao Guangfu, was brought from prison. First, the plaintiff, Xue Zhenyi, presented the grounds for his private prosecution, including a civil claim stating that Zhao was in prison in October of the 23rd year, and he, Xue, was in Ward 3 of the detention center. They fundamentally had no opportunity to meet, so how could he have planned extortion? He requested that detention center personnel be summoned to investigate. Zhao Guangfu testified that it was Xue who planned to obtain money through fraud and share it with everyone, and that he (Zhao) wrote the indictment on Xue's behalf. He claimed that Xue's status as a prison lawyer was known to all inmates, and he asked for veteran inmates to be interrogated. He claimed to have forgotten what he had previously testified in court. The court, upon reviewing the testimony, ordered the retrieval of case files for investigation and summoning of witnesses for interrogation. The next hearing was scheduled for the morning of the 13th, and Zhao was returned to prison.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Another Accusation: Ni Yueqiu Accused of Killing Three <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Justice Re-Assigns Case for Trial; Ni Claims He Had No Authority at the Time</p>
<p>Ni Yueqiu, the district chief of the Fifth District of Qilin Town in Haimen and concurrently the head of the local defense corps, took matters into his own hands when the communists spread in the 19th year of the Republic. His former teacher, Sun Yuanfu, publicly reprimanded him, incurring his wrath and leading to Sun's execution under the guise of authority. Sun's widow, Madam Sun Chen, filed accusations with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice and Administration, also accusing Ni of assisting the former Haimen County Magistrate Wu Yaochun in bribery. The case was transferred to the Jiangsu High Court, which instructed the Shanghai District Court to handle it. In April of the 23rd year of the Republic, Ni Yueqiu was apprehended and tried in Nantong. As a result, Ni Yueqiu was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment. While the case was under appeal, farmers Yuan Sanlang, Yuan Shen, Yu Jianglang, and Ge Zhao, among others, jointly filed a petition with the Ministry of Justice, accusing Ni Yueqiu of using his authority to commit murder. The Ministry ordered the Shanghai District Court to handle the cases together. After an investigation by the prosecutor, a clear case was established, and another indictment was filed. Yesterday at 10 AM, Judge Chen continued the trial. Yuan Sanlang, Yuan Shen, Yu Jianglang, and Ge Zhao, among others, appeared in court, testifying that the defendant served as the district chief of the Fifth District and the head of the defense corps in Haimen County during the 19th year. At that time, due to communist disturbances in the countryside, the defendant, on July 20th of that year, personally led several members of the defense corps, under the pretext of arresting bandits, falsely accused farmers Yuan Erlang, Yuan Qinglang, Yu Jiangcai, and Ge Linggou, who had previous grudges with him, of being bandits. Without presenting them to the county for trial, he arbitrarily had them tied up and executed in the wilderness of Qilin Town. The deceased died with grievances, and the living were heartbroken, so they requested legal action. Questioned about this, Ni Yueqiu claimed that he heard the public security team had captured and executed four bandits. As district chief, he was merely an intermediary between the district and the county government and had no authority to manage judicial matters.

<h3 id="e138">Police Search All Night, Crack Down on Bandit Den in Jiangwan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Eleven Male and Female Bandit Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Abbot Miao Yong of the Guanyin Temple in Gongxing Bridge North, Xibinxing Road, Zhabei, a Sichuan native aged 35, had accumulated some savings, attracting the attention of bandits. Around 1 AM on March 31st, a large group of over ten bandits, all dressed in blue cloth shirts and pants and armed with one handgun and three or four sharp knives, demolished the bamboo fence and entered through the back door. They cut the wires, pried open the doors, displayed their weapons, and forbade anyone from making a sound. First, they tied up Abbot Miao Yong with ropes and rummaged through the boxes and chests, looting the clothing and valuables of the dharma masters Jiru, Yide, Zhineng, Nengjin, and Miao Yong, worth four to five hundred yuan. The bandits escaped with their loot and disappeared. The victim, Miao Yong, reported the case to the North Station Branch Bureau, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday, Detective Jiao Bingyun received a tip that the major robber bandits who looted the Guanyin Temple and the monk's property were hiding in the Liangjia Tomb Mountain and Gujiazhai areas of Jiangwan, requesting an investigation. He reported this to Liang Fuchu, the chief of the North Station Branch Bureau, and Gu Liancheng and Guo Mengqu, the leaders of the Detective Squad, who then reported to Cai Jingjun, the Director-General, and Zhang Datong, the Commander-in-Chief, for approval. Squad leader Gao Song and Hu Kui Sheng were dispatched, leading detectives Jiao Bingyun, Yang Fuchen, Zhang Dalong, Zhou Jitang, Kong Rongsheng, Huai Xinmao, Chen Mian, Zhang Liangjin, Yang Hanzhang, Hu Daoxi, and other personnel on duty, along with informants. They disguised themselves and, together with police officers Qu Shixin and Sun Jiyuan from the Jiangwan Police Station, rushed to the bandit den at No. 1 Liangjia Tomb Mountain around 3 AM yesterday morning. They surrounded the place. Ji Chengyu (aka Little Black Skin, a 36-year-old from Nantong), a bandit inside the house, noticed the detectives and opened fire. The bullet flew over Squad Leader Guo's head. Squad Leader Gu and Detective Jiao fearlessly charged in from the front and back. They saw Ji trying to crawl on the ground, attempting to escape through the window. They apprehended him, seized a 6-inch Browning handgun, serial number 152665, with eight bullets in the magazine, one of which was chambered but did not detonate. They found forty bullets and a spent cartridge in a newspaper-wrapped mechanism on the wall, along with a rifle butt and two magazines. Ji's wife, Zhao (a 28-year-old from Nantong), and Gu Fengxi (a 55-year-old from Haimen) were also arrested. The team interrogated them thoroughly. Ji confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices. The original team of detectives continued to Gujiazhai to arrest Ji Dahong (a 33-year-old from Nantong), Cao Zhigao (a 26-year-old from Nantong), and Bao Wenming (a 38-year-old from Nantong). Later, in Xiaogujiazhai, they arrested Yang Defu (a 29-year-old from Haimen). Then, at No. 12 Qu, Gongxing Bridge, they arrested Ge Defu (a 35-year-old from Nantong) and Lu Haitao (a 36-year-old from Nantong). Finally, they rushed to a northern-style house in Dijia浜, Yinxianggang, and arrested Zhao Jinwen (a 26-year-old from Nantong) and Cao Yonggao (a 25-year-old from Nantong). After searching all night, the detectives arrested a total of eleven male and female bandits. After detailed interrogation by Squad Leaders Gu and Guo, Ji and the others confessed to the robbery of the Guanyin Temple on Xibaoxing Road, Gongxing Bridge North, late on the night of March 31st, and the property of the monks. Because the case involved armed robbery, the North Station Branch Bureau detained them pending transfer to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Robber Shot Dead at Yuegui Lane, Identities Confirmed <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Robber Liu Yonghua Admits to Robbery</p>
<p>The Caoxiangtai cotton cloth store at No. 276 Fada Road was invaded by two armed robbers at 7:50 PM the night before last. They stole eleven yuan and fled. The owner called the police, and Hua constable No. 824 from the French Concession police pursued them to Yuegui Lane on Fujian Road in the Public Concession, where he shot and killed robber Jia Guizhang (29 years old, from Shandong) and seized a handgun. The other robber, Liu Yonghua (42 years old, from Shandong), fled into No. 4 Dongxin Lane on Maidie'an Road, where Hua constable No. 220 pursued and apprehended him. He was taken back to the police station for investigation. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Public Concession police transported the robber's body to the autopsy office on Feilun Road that night. Four yuan in banknotes, 41 cents, and 6 dimes were found on the deceased. The seized handgun and spent cartridges were examined and found to be linked to a previous murder. The Public Concession police also determined that the arrested robber, Liu Yonghua, had been sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment in the Public Concession Court on August 16, 1930, for robbery. Yesterday morning, the Public Concession police first reported to the Special First Court and dispatched personnel to examine the robber's body. The French Concession police then notified the Tongren Auxiliary Burial Hall to send workers to the Feilun Road autopsy office to transport Jia Guizhang's body back to the French Concession autopsy office. At noon, they reported to the Special Second Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren and a clerk to conduct the autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the robber had been shot twice, in the head and right foot, and died from his injuries. The Tongren Auxiliary Burial Hall was ordered to bury the body. At 3 PM, the French Concession police sent the arrested robber, Liu Yonghua, to the Special Second Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Fei Xizhen, representing the French Police Bureau, stated the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation before requesting a trial. Detective Zuo Qihong then reported the details of the case and presented the seized handgun and stolen money. Chen Wenda, an apprentice at Caoxiangtai, and Hua constables No. 824 and No. 220, testified about the robbery and the pursuit and killing of the robber. When questioned, Liu Yonghua confessed that he met Jia Guizhang in Qingdao and came to Shanghai three days ago. They planned to rob together, but he claimed he did not carry a handgun during the robbery. The court, after reviewing the testimony, ordered an adjournment to the morning of the 13th for further inquiry. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Xu Qizhong Accused of Wastefulness: Trial Concluded <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for Afternoon of the 12th</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, the son of the wealthy Wuxing merchant Xu Wan, living in Shanghai, filed for bankruptcy with the First Special District Court after squandering his wealth, accumulating tens of thousands in debt, and being unable to repay it. His creditors, including the Sincere Company and several others, argued that Xu's bankruptcy was solely due to wastefulness and should not be equated with bankruptcy due to business failure. Therefore, they hired attorney Le Junwei to file a criminal lawsuit against Xu based on Articles 154 and 156 of the Bankruptcy Law promulgated on October 1st of last year, requesting punishment according to the law. The court summoned Xu for trial, and Xu also hired an attorney to defend him, claiming that all debts were incurred before the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, and the law should not be applied retroactively, arguing that ignorance is no excuse. However, this argument was strongly opposed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff's attorney continued to submit a written statement to the court after the last hearing, attacking the defendant's defense, stating that the defendant's invocation of the principle of non-retroactivity in Article 1 of the Criminal Law was a misunderstanding. The crime under the Bankruptcy Law, is conditional on the confirmation of the bankruptcy declaration as the basis for punishment. If the debtor only engages in wasteful behavior without declaring bankruptcy, there is legally no crime. The crime can only be established and punished according to law after bankruptcy is declared and confirmed. Although the defendant's wasteful behavior occurred before the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, the bankruptcy declaration and its confirmation occurred after the implementation. Therefore, there is no room for the application of Article 1 of the Criminal Law. If the wasteful behavior and the declaration and confirmation of bankruptcy had all been completed before the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, the defendant's defense invoking Article 1 of the Criminal Law would not be unreasonable. Since Xu Qizhong's bankruptcy occurred after the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, even though the wasteful behavior occurred before the implementation, according to legal principles, how can he invoke that article for defense? He should be sentenced according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan continued to summon the defendant to the court for investigation. Attorney Le reiterated the above points and presented bills from the St. Anna and Paramount dance halls after October 1st of last year, proving that the defendant continued to waste money even after the implementation of the Bankruptcy Law. Xu's attorney defended him, emphasizing the principle of "non-retroactivity" in the Criminal Law, arguing that this was a fundamental principle of law and could not be easily overturned. The Bankruptcy Law also only sanctions crimes committed after its implementation. Xu Qizhong's wasteful behavior all occurred before the law came into effect, so he requested that the defendant be declared not guilty. Judge Tan, after the closing arguments, scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of May 12th.</p>

<p>Flees Home and Co-Habits with Another Man; Husband Detects and Stabs the Paramour</p>
<p>Wang Weifa, a coolie from Ningbo, currently 37 years old, working at a scrap cloth store in Jiangwan's Qimei Road, and his wife, Ding, lived together on Qipu Road. Because Wang's income was limited, their life was extremely difficult, causing Ding to often express dissatisfaction. Ten days ago, Wang Weifa went to work in Jiangwan and only returned home the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, Ding had disappeared. After a secret investigation, he learned that his wife Ding had eloped with Wang Haifu. Wang Haifu, 33 years old, from Ningbo, worked as a groom at the racecourse on Mahuo Road. After becoming acquainted with Ding, they cohabited at No. 15 Yonghe Lane, Kaifeng Road, living together like husband and wife. Wang Weifa, after learning the truth, was consumed by anger. He went to investigate the night before last and found Ding and Wang Haifu in bed together. He quietly returned. Last night, Wang Weifa hid a knife and went to Wang Haifu's house on Kaifeng Road. When Wang and Ding saw Wang Weifa arrive, they fled to the balcony. Wang Weifa chased after them and stabbed Wang Haifu three times with the knife, causing serious injuries to his arm and left abdomen, with blood gushing out. Someone reported it to the Huishi Police Station, who sent detective Gao Yuqing to arrest the assailant Wang Weifa. The knife was also seized and taken to the police station. The injured man was sent to Baojiang Hospital for treatment. This morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station charged him with aggravated assault under Article 278 of the Criminal Law, stating the case and saying that doctors at Baojiang Hospital had confirmed that Wang Haifu's arm was injured, and the left abdomen was even more severely injured, with the omentum protruding. The injuries were dangerous, so he could not be brought to court today. He requested that the case be postponed. Wang Ding also turned herself in, confessing to cohabiting with Wang Haifu since the sixth day of the first lunar month after eloping, because Wang Weifa could not provide for her. She claimed she did not see the stabbing last night. Questioned, Wang Weifa confessed to the stabbing. Judge Tan Xinzhen, after reviewing the testimony, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and the case adjourned to the 13th.</p>

The day before yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, she accused the girl of stealing twenty cents and beat her severely. The girl took the opportunity to escape and wandered crying around the Jiaxing Road Bridge. Constable No. 759, patrolling the street, saw her and learned of the situation. He brought the girl to the police station, reported to the chief, sent the girl to Guangren Hospital for examination and confirmation of the injuries, and temporarily placed her in the Jiliang Institute. He dispatched a detective to arrest Chen Xu and seize the wooden stick. Chen Xu was taken to the Jiaxing Road Police Station and transferred to the women's prison. This morning, she was brought to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Municipal Council stated the case. The constable then presented the wooden stick. The girl, Yulan, claimed that her aunt sold her to the defendant last spring. She said she did not steal any money, and the defendant, who was addicted to opium, often beat her with feather dusters and wooden sticks and did not give her enough to eat. The court examined the injuries clearly. Questioned, Chen Xu's testimony was evasive. Attorney Li requested an adjournment to investigate whether she was addicted to opium and to file a charge accordingly. Judge Xiao ordered her to be remanded in custody and the case adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhou Jiasheng, the son of Zhou Chunbo, residing at No. 135 Bubo Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, was taken away by the maid, Yu Zhou, on the afternoon of the 4th of last month and fell into the hands of kidnappers. Afterward, Zhou received a letter from the bandits, demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan for his release. He realized he had been kidnapped, reported it to the police, and Inspector Jin Jiulin, detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Buguang, and other detectives subsequently arrested thirteen male and female kidnappers, including Jin Fengxiang and Jin Zhou.

<p>Sentenced to be Sent to Ningbo for Trial</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaosheng, a Ningbo native aged 35, and Zhang Tiecheng (also known as Yang Ming), who was killed by the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, repeatedly committed dozens of kidnapping and murder cases in Ningbo. The Ningbo authorities strictly pursued and arrested them. Knowing that it would be difficult to survive in Ningbo, Zhou fled to Shanghai. Chen Peng, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, and Hua detective Chang Wu Zhenyuan learned that Zhou was hiding at No. 2, Lane 253, Yunnan Road, Public Concession. They took a letter of authorization and, at 1:45 PM the day before yesterday, together with Chief Inspector Feng Zhiming of the General Inspectorate, rushed to arrest him. Zhou was lying on a bed, smoking opium. The detectives arrested him and seized the opium paraphernalia. Under interrogation, Zhou, having committed many crimes, could not remember them all. He recalled three cases: 1. On March 3rd of the 22nd year, he kidnapped Wang Xingyou and a Wang family boy in Shiqiao, Naxiang, Ningbo, and received a ransom of 6,000 yuan. 2. On April 5th of the 22nd year, he kidnapped a 19-year-old girl, Li Shaoe, in Shanglijia, Naxiang, and received a ransom of 600 yuan. 3. Last September, he kidnapped a Ma family doctor in Ninghaiqiao and received a ransom of 4,500 yuan. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court.

The Ningbo Public Security Bureau's detective submitted the letter, requesting the transfer of the Zhou. Zhou Xiaosheng confessed to kidnapping in Ningbo.

<p>Two Months Imprisonment, Three Years Probation</p>
<p>Store Employee Sentenced to Six Months for Transporting Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Wu Tangshi, the wife of Wu Lusheng, owner of Zhenxing Hardware Store at No. 621 Henan Road and No. 491 Mei Bai Ge Road, after having a disagreement with her husband, Wu Lusheng, took 754 yuan in cash and several dozen checks with a face value of 4,916 yuan from the store. She fled with a store employee named Cao Shouzheng, first to Suzhou and then to Wuxi. Wu Lusheng apprehended them at Room 26 of the New World Hotel in Wuxi. He reported it to the Detective Division of the Patrol Bureau, who dispatched detectives Gao Zhenhua and Bao Tan Tian Yuan to Wuxi to bring them back to Shanghai. They were brought before the First Special District Court. Wu Tangshi was released on bail of 5,000 yuan, while Cao was remanded in custody for further questioning. This news was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin of the First Special Court continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The Patrol Bureau's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that after the adjournment, the Patrol Bureau went to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau on April 30 and retrieved the stolen goods. This included 480 yuan in paper money, 120 yuan in fractional currency, 7 silver dollars, 50 single fractional coins, and a diamond ring. The defendant had previously stated that she had a box deposited with her uncle, Sun Fushan, on Gordon Road. The Patrol Bureau investigated Sun's home. Sun claimed ignorance, but his wife stated that Wu Tangshi, her store employee Wang Yugui, and a nanny had indeed deposited a trunk, saying that the store owner was away and that Wu Tangshi had to go to Suzhou, so they were temporarily storing it. The next day, they called Wu Lusheng at the store and told him to come and get it. Wu, along with Wang Yugui and the nanny, then took the trunk away in a cart. Thus, the whereabouts of the trunk were accounted for. Furthermore, it was stated that the checks were given to Wu Wenhua, the owner of the Wu Deyuan Lumber Mill in Xiaodongmen. The Patrol Bureau found that Wu was employed at the Xiangxing Foreign Firm on Beijing Road. Upon investigating the foreign firm, Wu Wenhua stated that Cao Shouzheng had indeed given him 54 checks, asking him to collect them. Eighteen checks, totaling 488 yuan and 52 cents, had already been collected. The remaining 36 checks and the money were handed over to the Patrol Bureau. The plaintiff, Wu Lusheng, originally hired lawyer Yang Linzhi to file a civil suit. However, since the lost items had been recovered and only a small amount was missing, he declared the withdrawal of the civil suit. Subsequently, Sun Fushan, Wang Yugui, and others testified. Cao Shouzheng continued to deny any collusion with the mistress in the theft. After arguments between the Patrol Bureau's lawyer Qian and the defendant's lawyer, the presiding judge announced the verdict: Wu Tangshi was sentenced to two months imprisonment, suspended for three years, for theft; Cao Shouzheng was sentenced to six months imprisonment for transporting stolen goods.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Union convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of purchasing an airplane as a birthday gift, inviting executive and supervisory committee members. Over ten people attended, including Zhang Zilian, Tu Kaizheng, Jiang Zhonghe, Cao Zhigong, Shu Huizhen, Xian Guansheng, Xu Wenbin, Zhou Shixuan, Xu Jianfan, Ma Jisheng, Sun Choucheng, and Ma Xishen. Chairman Mu Xingzhuang reported that for Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday, all sectors have been raising funds to purchase an airplane as a gift. The union has been dedicated to promoting national products. To boost sales of national products, it is essential to strengthen national defense and prevent aggression. Last year, when German Chancellor Hitler celebrated his 44th birthday, the entire nation purchased over 500 airplanes as a birthday gift, greatly benefiting national defense. Provinces, cities, and counties are now initiating similar efforts, and the future results are immeasurable. Therefore, this meeting was convened to discuss fundraising methods. Zhang Zilian stated that if the people do not unite and support their leader, they will be like loose sand, easily bullied. Everyone knows that Chairman Chiang is working hard to govern the country, and we should raise substantial funds to purchase an airplane as a birthday gift to show our support. Zhou Shixuan stated that the Qinkung Shengji Dyeing and Weaving Factory strongly supports this matter and will take the lead in raising funds once the methods are decided. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>*   Notify all member factories that all staff members should donate at least one day's salary or more. The factory's donation should match the total amount donated by all staff members. Workers who are not members of the union are welcome to donate, limited to one day's wage or more.</p>
<p>*   Send letters to various national products organizations, urging them to advocate for this cause.</p>
<p>*   Designate the Shanghai Bank as the fundraising agency. Members should send their donations to the bank and notify the union for record-keeping.</p>

<p>Since its opening, the Central Savings Society has seen booming business. To facilitate account holders in the interior, the society is establishing branch offices throughout the country. Branches in Tianjin and Beiping are also expected to be established soon. Initially, when the society took over the Sino-French Savings Society, account holders were concerned about potential losses. It has been reported that the society is offering exceptional preferential treatment to former Sino-French Savings Society account holders. Concrete measures have been formulated and communicated to all account holders. Those who hold prize-winning savings passbooks from the Sino-French Savings Society can exchange them for new passbooks from the society without incurring any losses. As for special fixed deposit savings, the society is allowing account holders to retain their original prize-winning savings amounts and exchange them for new passbooks. Regarding ordinary savings accounts from the Sino-French Savings Society, those that have matured can be withdrawn in cash or continued to be deposited with the Central Trust Bureau. Those that have not matured will be deposited with the Central Trust Bureau, earning interest according to the savings regulations. It is said that exchanging for new passbooks is most advantageous for former Sino-French Savings Society account holders. Previously, a monthly payment of 15 yuan in Sino-French accounts only offered a top prize of 10,000 yuan. Under the new society's regulations, a monthly payment of 12 yuan offers the hope of a top prize of 25,000 yuan. Moreover, since the society is newly established, the number of participating numbers in the lottery is currently less than 50,000, thus increasing the chances of winning. Furthermore, account holders can still win prizes in the fifteenth year, even without making payments. Under the Sino-French Savings Society's system, participation in the lottery ceased in the final year. There are also various other preferential measures, such as reduced payments for account holders who prepay their savings for six months or a year. Additionally, the refund amount upon withdrawal is higher than that of the Sino-French Savings Society. The society's bonus fund accumulates compound interest annually. Even if account holders withdraw midway, the unissued bonuses will also accrue interest. Therefore, the bonus earned by account holders who complete the term is several times higher than that of the Sino-French Savings Society. The society has a fund of 5 million yuan and is a state-run institution with the sole purpose of encouraging national savings. The regulations are designed to benefit account holders. Therefore, former Sino-French Savings Society account holders are eagerly exchanging their old passbooks for new ones.</p>

<p>Shanghai Pushan Villa's charity report for April 1936, covering both the Chinese and foreign concession areas. A total of 190 large coffins and 3,270 small coffins were collected for burial. 1,670 coffins of various sizes were provided. This included 37 large coffins and 2,003 small coffins collected by the main villa, along with the exhumation of 7 sets of bones. The Xiejiao Nanshi branch villa and various charitable halls in the French Concession collected 622 small coffins. The Public Concession's police stations and the Health Bureau consulted on unclaimed children's corpses and bodies from various hospitals within the concession, resulting in the collection of 134 large coffins and 623 small coffins. The Lianyi Charity Association collected 5 large coffins and 15 small coffins. The Women and Children's Relief Association Orphanage collected 3 large coffins. The Red Cross Society First Hospital collected 4 large coffins. Tongren Hospital collected 3 large coffins. The Epidemic Hospital collected 2 large coffins and 1 small coffin. Guangren Hospital collected 1 small coffin. Guangci Hospital collected 1 large coffin. Guangyi Chinese Medicine Hospital collected 1 large coffin. Cihang Hospital collected 2 small coffins. Tongde Hospital collected 3 small coffins. The Pushan Obstetrics Hospital of the White Cross Society on Xinmin Road in Zhabei provided medical consultations and medication to a total of 3,077 patients. It has been observed that the recent erratic weather and the prevalence of smallpox have led to a higher number of deaths, making the villa's burial work, medical consultations, and medication distribution even busier. However, the expenses are enormous and the funds are strained. We earnestly hope that philanthropists from all walks of life will provide assistance to help alleviate the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Ancient Meaning of New Life <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>By Zhang Shouyong</p>
<p>Everyone thinks that the three characters "New Life" are a new term or a colloquialism. Calling it a colloquialism, it is indeed a colloquialism. Village women work all day long and say to each other, "Is today's life finished?" What is called "life" is their work. Because they cannot live without this work, they call work "life." When asked by a scholar what the two characters "life" come from, some are speechless and cannot answer. I tell them, "Have you read Mencius? 'The people cannot live without water and fire,' which speaks of the importance of life." What the village women say is based on Mencius. Today, everyone knows about life, but they do not read Mencius thoroughly. How can they neglect what is said to be "gained, then there is life; lost, then there is death"? How can they talk about the New Life? Nothing is more important to life than water and fire. Everyone knows how to seek water and fire, but they do not know how to seek propriety, justice, integrity, and shame. Is this not valuing water and fire over propriety, justice, integrity, and shame? Qi, a state; one country; Guan Zhong, the assistant to the hegemon, still knew to teach the people that if the four cardinal virtues are not upheld, the country will perish. The four cardinal virtues are propriety, justice, integrity, and shame. Today, in such a large China, the descendants of the enlightened Yellow Emperor, with the knowledge and skills passed down by generations of sages, leave teachings to our descendants, and yet they are not as enlightened as countries that were civilized thousands of years later and are located overseas, who still know how to恪守礼法. What shame could be greater! Moreover, the system passed down in our country begins with ritual education. In the past, the laws were based on ritual education. To guide them with ritual is to include propriety, justice, integrity, and shame. Ritual is reason, that is, order. Today's so-called守秩序is ritual. Where does the phrase 守秩序come from? When asked by a scholar, they are speechless and do not know. I tell them again, "Have you read the Book of Documents? It says, 'Heaven orders with ritual,' which is what is called秩. Have you read Mencius? There is order between elders and juniors, which is what is called序. To run ahead of elders is called不弟." To run ahead of elders is a small matter of disrespect, but it is called不弟. Therefore,守秩序has always been the beginning of ritual education for ancient people. Someone may ask, "Does the so-called cleaning movement today exist in ancient times?" I say, "Mencius said, 'Enter their borders, open up the fields and manage them well, then there will be celebration.' This is the greatest kind of cleaning. Zizhang said, 'Sprinkling and sweeping, responding and retreating, then it is acceptable.' This is the smallest kind of cleaning." Wang Yangming extended it by saying, "Sprinkling and sweeping, responding and retreating, the essence enters the spirit, small sprinkling and sweeping, responding and retreating. It is said that the essence enters the spirit." It can be seen that everything starts from the small things, and the presence or absence of spirit can be seen in them. Someone may also ask, "Is there anything to say about keeping time?" I say, "Confucius said, 'A man without trustworthiness, I do not know what he is good for. A large cart without a yoke, a small cart without a linchpin, how can I travel?'" Today, when we look at meetings, they are often delayed, not knowing how much time is wasted. Keeping time is valuing time, and it is keeping Confucius's戒that a man without trustworthiness is unknowable! Someone may also say, "What are the bases for today's so-called three transformations?" I say: Confucius emphasized military affairs at the Jiaogu meeting, and the arrangements were unhurried. If preparations are not made in advance, how could one not humiliate the country! His saying that military affairs are something he has not learned was only addressed to Duke Ling of Wei. Wei did not need to use troops, so he replied that he had not learned it. This is the meaning of "I will not participate in fighting tigers on foot or crossing rivers without a boat." What he usually paid attention to was war. Zengzi said, "One can entrust the life of a hundred miles, and one cannot be taken away at a time of great moral crisis." Is this not military transformation? What Zilu called "being able to make them brave and knowing the principles" included a wide range of things, and military discipline was one aspect of it. One can be used only after knowing the principles, and one cannot be used if one does not know the principles. If everyone maintains military transformation, then everyone will know the principles. Furthermore, to take the Book of Great Learning, from illuminating virtue, to loving the people, and stopping at perfection, its final chapter says, "There is a way to create wealth; those who produce it are many, those who consume it are few; those who work on it are quick, those who use it are leisurely." Those who produce and make it should take "many" and "quick," while those who consume and use it should take "few" and "leisurely." The economic principles of ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign, are no different from this. Is this not production transformation! Scholars avoid talking about financial management and consider not managing production to be noble. Therefore, they are poor and sick. Production transformation is the foundation of governance. 行有餘力、則以學文, Zhu Xi said that文 is the literature of the Book of Songs and the Six Arts.游於藝, 吾不試, Therefore, Art is especially valued by the ancients. What the Song Confucianists called being vibrant, if it is not artistic化, then the spirit cannot be flexible, and it is not just fine arts! Mr. Chiang has a thorough understanding of the situation in ancient and modern times, and he has combined it with the New Life Movement of Confucius. Since the beginning, the old bad habits have been transformed by the new human heart, and they have been deeply affected. As the poem says, "Zhou is an old country, but its destiny is new." New is to reform the old. Confucius said, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new," Zhu Xi said, "The old is what was heard in the past, and the new is what is gained today. It must be based on what was heard in the past to have new gains." I hope that people all over the country will seek newness based on ancient meanings, so that the national spirit can return to the old times of Tang, Yu, and the Three Dynasties, and all actions will be mindful of the principle of物競天擇,优胜劣收, to reform and innovate to seek today's survival. Then the China of the Book of Songs, the Book of Documents, the Book of Rites, and the Book of Music, uniting scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants to rise up together, will surpass the civilized countries of Europe and America. The inscription on Tang's basin says, "If you can make it new one day, make it new every day, and again make it new." Overcoming national difficulties is here, and establishing the foundation of the country is also here! Fellow countrymen, gentlemen, let us encourage each other!</p>

<p>Wu Bixian Sets New High Jump Record</p>
<p>Reaching a Height of 1.871 Meters. Fu Baolu, Dong Shuquan, and Wang Shilin Barely Qualify</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The second performance test for the track and field athletes training for the World Games in our country was held at the Qinghua University Educational Field in Beiping at 4 PM on the 4th. The weather was unfavorable that day, with wind and sand affecting performance to a considerable extent. In addition to the 22 athletes who had already reported, Li Peigen, a renowned 800-meter runner, also participated in the test. Before 3 PM, the sports field was already packed with spectators. The test began promptly at 4 PM. Except for Jin Changxian, Sun Yueming, and Zhang Kan, who voluntarily gave up their rights, Lin Shaozhou, Liu Changchun, Wang He, Yang Henghuan, and Liu Shikui, who requested leave due to illness, and Dong Hanwen, who was absent due to other matters, only 14 people participated in the test. The events included 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, high jump, triple jump, pole vault, shot put, discus, and javelin. The 800 meters, 1500 meters, 10,000 meters, long jump, high hurdles, and middle hurdles were not held due to a lack of participants. As a result, Wu Bixian set a new national record in the high jump with a height of 1.871 meters. Dong Shuzhao in the 400 meters, Fu Baolu in the pole vault, and Wang Shilin in the triple jump all achieved qualifying scores. In total, 11 people qualified in the two tests. The next test is scheduled for 4 PM on the 11th of this month, still at Qinghua University. Ma Yuehan has already sent a letter to Shen Siliang urging the payment of the national sports association subsidy for the 11 qualified athletes, which should be remitted to Beiping within days. The results of the second test for the track and field pre-selection training class are recorded below:</p>
<p>Breaking the National Record</p>
<p>The high jump participants were still Wu Bixian and Liu Mengji. Starting at 1.76 meters, Wu cleared 1.82 meters on his first attempt, while Liu struggled and jumped four times to clear it. When the height was raised to 1.871 meters, Liu withdrew, and Wu Bixian cleared it on his first attempt, although his left hand touched the bar, fortunately without knocking it down. This jump broke his own national record of 1.82 meters. When the height was raised to 1.93 meters, he failed to clear it due to fatigue, but he came very close.</p>
<p>Achieving Standard Scores: In the 400 meters, Jia Lianren and Dong Shuzhao competed against each other. They finished at the same time, with no clear winner, in 52.4 seconds, exceeding the standard record of 53 seconds.</p>
<p>Only Fu Baolu participated in the pole vault. Wang He did not participate due to illness. Fu cleared 3.63 meters and then rested.</p>
<p>Yang Henghuan did not participate in the triple jump due to illness. The audience thought that the event would be canceled, so they were about to leave when Wang Shilin, known for his triple jump skills, came to participate in the test. After several jumps, he cleared the standard record of 14 meters with a jump of 14.01 meters. Since there was no one to compete with him, he did not make a final effort.</p>
<p>Mediocre Performances: Only Zhang Lingjia and Cheng Mengping participated in the discus throw. Zhang Lingjia took first place with a throw of 36.05 meters, and Cheng Mengping took second place with a throw of 34.90 meters. Liu Changchun did not participate in the 200 meters due to a leg injury. Only Dai Shuguo and Zhang Yinming participated, accompanied by the newly arrived Li Peigen.

<p>Chizhi Defeats Guanghua Yesterday to Claim Second Place</p>
<p>The 9th Jiangda Volleyball Tournament concluded yesterday with two matches: Fudan vs. Jinan and Chizhi vs. Guanghua, held at the Jinan and Guanghua courts respectively. Fudan defeated Jinan in straight sets, winning all three matches and retaining the championship. Chizhi also defeated Guanghua 3-0 to claim second place. The match details and overall results of the tournament are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan vs. Jinan: The match between Fudan and Jinan took place at the Jinan court at 3 PM yesterday. Jinan took the initiative after the start, scoring the first point. Fudan responded quickly, and with Yuan Zejian's agile performance, Jinan took a 5-2 lead. Fudan's Chen Zongqiang unleashed powerful shots, quickly scoring ten points. The score went back and forth until 20-13, when Fudan's Zhou Dayun scored again, easily winning the first set 21-13. In the second set, Jinan once again took the offensive, scoring the first point. Zhou Dayun calmly scored four consecutive points. After a 12-12 tie, Jinan's defense gradually loosened, and Fudan seized the opportunity to win again 21-15. In the third set, Fudan did not easily let up. Zhou Dayun delivered a spectacular performance, scoring many points on his own, always finding unexpected and effective ways to defeat the enemy. Jinan also changed its tactics and had a turning point, leading 7-6 and 11-10 at one point. However, their overall coordination was not as tight and skillful as Fudan's, and they ultimately failed, resulting in a score of 21-16. Overall, Fudan defeated Jinan in straight sets, winning the Jiangda Volleyball Championship this year.</p>

<p>Chizhi vs. Guanghua: The match between Chizhi and Guanghua was refereed by Chen Deqian and started at 3 PM. Guanghua served first and scored one point. Chizhi was not willing to be outdone. Huang Yufu unleashed a high pressure attack, scoring two points. Wang Shen scored two own goals, and Yu Hewen rose in the middle, scoring two consecutive points. The score then tied several times. However, Chizhi's defense was tight, and they relied on Huang Yufu's smashing attacks, which often left Guanghua helpless. When the score reached 18-12, Guanghua's momentum was strong, and they tied the score, showing signs of a comeback. However, due to repeated own goals, they ultimately failed. The result was 21-18, with Chizhi winning. In the second set, Guanghua once again scored first. Chizhi's Mai Zhihong made a powerful attack, and Huang Yufu assisted from the side, quickly increasing the score. Guanghua's Situ Mu also made near-net pressure hits, succeeding in scoring points. The score tied at 10-10. Chizhi's Huang Yufu was a general, using feints and achieving his goals. At 20-18, Guanghua fought bravely, putting on an amazing performance, but because they had lost too many points, they lost again 21-18. Guanghua, having lost two consecutive sets, was not discouraged and still concentrated on fighting. After the start of the third set, they scored one point first, but Chizhi took the opportunity to score seven consecutive points. After that, Guanghua never recovered. Chizhi's Huang Yufu made high pressure attacks and near-net pressure hits, all succeeding. They won again 21-18, with a total score of 2-0, Chizhi winning by a large margin.</p>

<p>Overall Results</p>
<p>The Fudan University volleyball team is very strong, with many talented volleyball players. Players such as Cao Tingzan and Qiu Qingxue have participated in the Far Eastern Games. The school has won the championship in Shanghai universities and other major volleyball tournaments for 20 consecutive years, a truly remarkable achievement. However, it is said that Fudan's volleyball strength will decrease slightly next year, as key players Qiu Guangxue, Zhou Dayun, and others may graduate or move elsewhere. With the dispersal of these athletes, there will inevitably be a feeling of loss.</p>

<p>Bausili Defeats Krammer</p>
<p>Three Doubles Matches Continue Today</p>
<p>Two public handball matches were held last night. In the match between our country's Sun Jialu and Ke Kling, Sun was not in his best form in the first set and encountered a strong opponent. The score was close in the first half, but after a 6-6 tie, Ke scored five consecutive points. In an instant, the score became 16-7, with Ke leading. Both of Ke's shots were forced into the lower corners, making them extremely dangerous. Sun then used his diagonal shots, making his opponent tired from running. After the score reached 12-16, the score progressed evenly, but Sun Jialu ultimately lost the first set 16-21 due to too many lost points. In the second set, Sun changed his strategy and frequently used high balls, leading 3-0. However, Ke Kling became extremely arrogant and scored as many as eleven consecutive points. Sun worked hard to catch up to 9-11, and then 17-18. Ke then scored three more consecutive points, winning again 17-21. In the other match, Bausili defeated Krammer 2-0, with a rather exciting match. Ke Kling and Bausili are scheduled to compete for the final spot on Monday, and the winner will compete against Zhu Kuan on the 14th for the championship.

<p>School Survey</p>
<h3 id="e178">Overview of the German School in Shanghai (3) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>3.  Administrative Overview</p>
<p>Administrative Organization: Under the current German national conditions, the administration of the school naturally adopts a centralized system. The School Affairs Committee is responsible for matters such as the custody of school property and the receipt and expenditure of funds. The School Affairs Committee is elected by the German Community Corporation. The committee consists of six people. First, the Community Corporation elects one person as the chairman of the committee, and then the chairman hires four German residents as committee members, plus the principal of the school as an ex-officio member, totaling six people. According to the principal of the school, this method imitates Hitler's system of total control.</p>
<p>The principal of the school is selected by the German Ministry of Education, which proposes three or four people with educational knowledge and experience, and asks the School Affairs Committee to select one person from these candidates. Teachers are also hired using the same method; of course, the principal can participate in the School Affairs Committee's opinions on hiring teachers. Many affairs of the school, such as the repair of school buildings and the receipt and expenditure of regular expenses, are managed by the School Affairs Committee; therefore, the principal can concentrate all efforts on presiding over the educational matters within the school. Also, because the number of students is small, the principal can independently preside over all school affairs without the need to establish other staff to assist.</p>
<p>Financial Income: The school's budget for this year is 85,000 yuan. The income includes: tuition fees of approximately 50,000 yuan; subsidies from the Community Corporation of 24,000 yuan; subsidies from the Public Concession工部局 of 7,000 yuan; and donations from other German residents of approximately 4,000 yuan. The expenditure includes: salaries for teachers and staff and wages for school workers of approximately 70,000 yuan, accounting for 82% of the total expenditure; other regular expenses of approximately 15,000 yuan, accounting for 18% of the total expenditure. The tuition fees paid by students at all levels vary: kindergarten students pay 130 yuan per year; primary school students pay 165 yuan per year; middle school students pay 220 yuan per year for the first six years and 600 yuan per year for the last three years. According to the principal of the school, there are not many German children who graduate from the school's middle school. Most students leave the school after completing six years of middle school. This situation is because the tuition fees for the last three years of middle school are too expensive, and many students drop out of school halfway to work; there are also many students who return to their home country to continue their studies.</p>
<p>4.  Emphasis on Free Discussion</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of the school's teaching is its emphasis on free discussion among students. The school's teaching purpose is to develop students' judgment and character. Free discussion is a good way to develop judgment. Free discussion can expand children's knowledge and enable children to acquire and understand various new ideas. Therefore, the school's teachers encourage children to engage in free discussion in primary school; when children are learning reading, writing, arithmetic, and other subjects, they can freely discuss the knowledge and skills in the subjects, and the teachers provide necessary guidance. The result of free discussion can enable children to experience many new insights and express many creative works in posture, language, drawing, or spelling.</p>
<p>In middle school, the spirit of free discussion is even more emphasized. The curriculum of the middle school department is relatively deep and broad, so middle school students need a more detailed understanding of the deep and broad curriculum. Free discussion is an important way to develop middle school students' comprehension. Middle school students can stimulate each other's thinking or exchange research insights in free discussion. The school further implements self-study guidance methods for students in the top two classes of the middle school department, allowing students to study automatically, and teachers are often in a guiding position.</p>

<p>Peiming Girls' Middle School in this city has been established for more than ten years. The original site was located west of Xinqiao at Shamban Factory on Maigen Road. Now, the principal of the school, Jin Yuezhang, has moved the school to the Nanyuan Building at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Hede Road in the Public Concession on May 3rd, because the original location was insufficient for use and to seek future development. The building occupies an area of approximately 20 mu and has been in operation for decades. Among them, there are towering old trees and fragrant flowers everywhere. The architecture is elegant and the environment is quiet. In recent days, students and parents have been calling on relatives and friends to visit, and those who come specifically to read the school's regulations are especially numerous.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Cocoon and Tea Uses Begin to Develop <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>This year's tea cocoon season was originally constrained by the market and has become the end of its rope. This time, the tea merchants' dispute over the red tea control has not yet ended. Therefore, although there are some sample transactions for the foreign merchants' sales channels, the tea houses are still watching. As a result, the tea market is quiet and there are no important observations. As for the news of Jiangzhe green tea, it has already started, but because the circulation of funds is not very convenient, the supply of goods is also not very smooth. Silver and money businesses are not convenient to supply the demand as much as possible. According to yesterday's observations, only some small loans were borrowed, amounting to no more than tens of thousands, which had no benefit to the overall market. On the cocoon season side, it is currently the time to start opening scales. Cocoon funds are not easy to collect, so there are not as many cocoon collectors as in previous years. Silk factories are also watching the success or failure without any preconceived notions. Foreign firms have slightly dispatched personnel to collect cocoons, but the amount of funds is limited. It is heard that although there are about ten places collecting in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the total amount of cocoon funds is only more than 2 million, and the large-scale departure must be delayed for another week or three or four days before it can be turned around. Looking at the tightness of the silver roots on this street from our objective perspective, the content is still tight and not loose. Outsiders cannot raise funds and can only wait quietly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the government bond market on the Chinese Securities Exchange showed a more sluggish trend. The market price fluctuated slightly. The absorption capacity of large investors has also decreased invisibly. Transactions only rely on a small number of retail investors entering and exiting. The market atmosphere is becoming more and more dull, and the trend is also turning dull. Therefore, it is difficult to get out of the hovering situation in the short term. The ups and downs of yesterday's market were uneven. Retail investors were still mostly sellers. At the opening in the morning, the far-term of Tong Ding fell by 3 jiao, and the rest only fluctuated by 5 cents to 1 jiao.

<p>Near-term Also Exits 200 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The yarn market is firm and the rise is slight, which is actually caused by the sharp fall in successive days, which has caused profiteers to make up for it. At the same time, spot yarn sales have developed, especially with Shu and Guangdong gangs buying diligently, and the inland belt also follows suit. Therefore, the rebound is more dramatic, and the market has slowly recovered.</p>
<p>Far-term Rises More Uniquely: In the spot yarn market, the opening was above the previous day, and the spot yarn sales were good. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and each month rose by 3-4 jiao. After the second market, it was heard that the Shu gang continued to purchase spot yarn, and the inland gang's intake was also healthy. By the time of closing, the buying interest in the far month was even stronger. As a result, each month rose by 5, 7, 8, 9 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. At the opening in the afternoon, the market was extremely tight, and there were more buyers in the market. Because yarn sales had hope for development, the popularity was even higher.

<p>Forward Dated Old Cotton Re-emerges Above 4 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market rebounds strongly, due to active yarn sales and improved sentiment. Good U.S. cotton prices prompt profit-taking by those buying up empty positions. The market appears somewhat depleted, leading prices to advance steadily. Old cotton for June, July, and August all re-emerge above the 4 yuan mark. However, the spot cotton market is not strong. Generally, industry players still hold a lukewarm attitude because of ample stocks of coarse cotton.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Rises by Five or Six Jiao. The previous market for spot cotton saw prices rise because U.S. cotton reached nine pence per pound, while Indian cotton fell by 0.25 to 1.25 rupees. Osaka cotton rose by 2.3 yuan. Market sentiment is strong and buying interest is growing. Following days of sharp declines, a rebound is occurring. Ningbo merchants are also buying up empty positions, giving the market a tight feel. Consequently, prices for all months rose by two to four or five jiao compared to the previous day's close. The market's upward momentum remained strong at the afternoon opening, buoyed by improved yarn sales and stable sentiment. By the third closing, prices had recovered further. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 1.2 jiao compared to the morning close.

Eastern goods were particularly active, with each piece rising by five fen, but this was limited to a few who were covering short positions. Most customers remained on the sidelines. Business on this street was not brisk, and imports were weak. Yesterday, 50 bales of Tongxing Factory's Yanghe fine twill were imported at a price of 6.85 yuan. Sales to customers from Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan, and the Yangtze River region were still good, with approximately 500-600 pieces of plain, printed, and colored cloth being transacted.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Grains: Inland Factories and Customers Dump Stocks, Wheat and Flour Plunge in Unison <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Flour Falls Below 3 Yuan. Wheat Also Drops by 0.14 Yuan</p>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, prices for all months showed a uniform decline. The quoted price for foreign wheat was nearly five jiao lower for Chicago and still 4.8 jiao lower. Canadian wheat was one jiao lower. When the market opened, sentiment was slightly calmer after the large drop. However, as trading extended to the later months, inland factories continued to dump stocks, causing the downward trend to resume. The volume of sellers increased further, and after the second trading session, the June contract fell below the 3 yuan mark, while the July, August, and September contracts also fell below the 0.9 jiao mark. Trading volume reached over 600,000. When the market opened in the afternoon, the sharp decline in wheat prices prompted factories to continue selling, and short covering was also very active. The market became extremely weak. The difference between the morning and afternoon sessions was as large as 0.1234 yuan. This decline is partly due to favorable weather conditions and partly a reaction to the extended period of high prices. Given the high base price in the market, a decline was perhaps inevitable. The spot wheat market is also seeing continued price declines of one jiao due to the large drop in standard wheat. It is heard that wheat from Nansuzhou is being offered at only 3.05 yuan for Dong wheat.</p>
<p>Private estimates of U.S. wheat production average 486 million bushels, which is bullish. However, some believe the estimate is too low. Demand for hard wheat is slow. Continued showers are forecast.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Dumeter Street Sales Are Not Strong <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Prices Have Fallen by About One Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over twenty merchants from various regions (with a total of over four thousand names) faced persistently sluggish sales on this street, making it difficult to sustain prices. Thick early japonica rice fell by one jiao. Thin indica rice remains weak, with only over seven hundred packages being handled by Dalian merchants. Prices were barely holding steady due to limited supply. However, other varieties saw a slight weakening of nearly one jiao. Dumeter foreign rice also fell by about one jiao, showing a weak and fatigued trend.</p>
<p>(North) Yesterday, twenty-six or twenty-seven merchants arrived from various regions of Hexia. Sales of various products in the market were sluggish as the weather warmed and most shops held back despite listing their goods. As a result, buying interest was weak. The market price of white japonica rice saw a small decline of 0.09 yuan for high-quality rice and a slightly larger decline of 0.1 jiao for mid-grade rice. Yin yuan and top-grade thin indica rice prices were stable, while white yuan and various indica rice prices showed a weak trend. Other goods also showed a weakening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Prospects for a Price Drop in Mid-Grade Customer Indica Rice <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica rice continued to arrive from the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang, but digestion in this street suddenly halted, and there were no inquiries for other sales channels. Some merchants were still holding firm due to cost considerations, leading to even quieter transactions. Throughout the day, only 477 packages of Jiangxi rice, 118 packages of Jiangbei rice, and 150 packages of big-grain rice were sold. Limited quantities of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The authorities are not allowing a continuation of previous tax policies on broken rice, which has strengthened the resolve of merchants not to easily sell off their stocks. However, as the weather warms, it will be difficult to hold mid-grade customer indica rice for long. If sales remain stagnant, mid-to-low-grade customer indica rice may need to be sold off at discounted prices.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Silk and Tea: Silk Trade Was Not Brisk Yesterday <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market was sluggish in New York and slightly lower in Yokohama, which made it difficult for foreign silk sales in Shanghai to be brisk. Manufacturers were also holding prices, so silk transactions were particularly sparse yesterday. Only Jardine Matheson and Lienner purchased 30 packages of white factory silk. The market atmosphere was again quiet and firm.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Red and Green New Tea Opened Yesterday <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the tea market for foreign firms. New samples of Wenzhou local red and green tea were displayed. Jiushengyong Tea Firm and Huacha Jinlong Company sold 42 boxes of Wenzhou black tea and 28 boxes of Shizhuang Zhenmei green tea. The opening price for black tea was 42 yuan, and the opening price for Zhenmei was 63 yuan. The selling price for black tea was slightly better than last year.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Sugar Market: Chaoshan Cyan Sugar Prices Rebounded <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable and transactions remained sparse. The guild's quoted prices for various grades, such as 24-grade coarse white sugar and eastern red and white sugar, remained unchanged. However, spot No. 4 eastern white sugar was slightly tight and quoted at 21.77 yuan. The quoted prices for Benchang cotton white Zhenji No. 1 and Dahua Jinxin No. 1 were 20.4 yuan and 20.6 yuan, respectively. There were no changes for the rest. Domestic sales remained sluggish for several days. Yesterday, Chaoshan merchants slightly reduced sales of approximately 60 packages of Chongti Qing at 10.2 yuan and over 100 packages of ordinary Huanggang Qing at 9.8 yuan, all showing a decline. However, according to telegrams from Shantou, the market there fluctuated and then contracted, decreasing by over 10 yuan from the previous day, which increased costs. From a Shanghai sales perspective, a turnaround is indeed possible. Therefore, a certain firm's large quantity of school red was offered a very short counter-offer and was not yet transacted.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the bid expiration date for the Yehe Joint Company. The total volume of Guangdong sugar to be set was 6,956 packages. The results were as follows: 470 packages of Shunde Factory's Wuyang coarse white sugar were transacted at 21.8 yuan, and another 15 packages of Quxi Factory were transacted at 20 yuan. Ten packages of No. 4 cotton white sugar were transacted at 20.6 yuan. The remaining styles were transacted at 20.8 yuan for medium-grade white granulated sugar and 19.8 yuan for medium sand white sugar. There were no significant price differences.</p>

<p>Quanzhou dried longan has been dormant due to long-term lack of sales. The quoted price has been suspended. Merchants who have not opened have already reached two months. It is now heard that merchants' inventories are gradually decreasing, and the market atmosphere is beginning to change. It is heard that merchants have gradually reopened price quotes over the past few days, totaling more than two hundred boxes. The price of the highest grade of large-sized top-grade goods is 58 yuan net, with subsequent reductions for lower grades. However, merchants are still incurring losses compared to their selling prices. The screening firm had previously sold at the top price of 57 yuan.</p>

<p>Although the Shanghai market for 300-pound American Association iron is not showing enthusiastic progress, the fixed price in Huaihai remains exceptionally strong recently. The price for old steel factory goods is 7 gold yuan and 6 jiao per box, and the price for new steel factory goods is 7 gold yuan and 4.5 jiao per box. Currently, the Shanghai market price is 34.5 yuan (including foreign fees) for old steel factory goods and 33.89 yuan (including foreign fees) for new steel factory goods. The spot prices in Shanghai are 34 yuan (old steel factory goods) and 33 yuan (new steel factory goods). Judging from the price of imported goods, there is still a negative margin of 0.45 to 0.89 yuan. Therefore, the current sales of goods are quite good, and the market situation remains very strong. However, due to the approaching mold season, the sales channels are not extensive, which is a major drawback.</p>

<h3 id="e205">The Righteous Man Wang <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>After the Qing dynasty destroyed the Ming dynasty, it issued an order requiring all people in Jiangnan to shave their hair and wear it in a queue. At that time, the Qing dynasty had just seized power and its power was immense. This order was carried out with great force. Who would dare to disobey? Only those with the heart of a tiger and the gall of a leopard, not afraid of losing their heads.</p>
<p>When the order reached Rugao County in Taizhou, the people of Rugao County all obeyed the order, shaved their hair, and wore it in a queue. Only one person, named Xu Yuanbo, refused. Xu Yuanbo was neither an official nor a scholar, but just an ordinary commoner.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanbo said very well, "I am Chinese. Why should I listen to the foreign emperor's words and shave my hair? The foreign emperor killed our emperor and occupied our land. Is that not enough? He still wants to control our hair. If I shave my hair, wouldn't I become a slave of the foreign emperor? I can't do it! You can kill my head, but I cannot shave my hair!"</p>
<p>These words reached the ears of the government officials, and they were all shocked. They all thought, "This is terrible! Defying the imperial decree! If we don't deal with him, our superiors will know, and it may harm our future!" So they sent people to arrest Xu Yuanbo's family and question him. Xu Yuanbo directly admitted it without denying anything. They reported the details to their superiors and sentenced Xu Yuanbo to death for defying the imperial decree. He was taken to the execution ground and beheaded. Xu Yuanbo's wife was also sentenced to exile and was about to set off immediately.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a yamen runner in Rugao County named Wang. There were not many kind people among the yamen runners. Although Runner Wang was a yamen runner, he had a few hard bones in his body, was loyal, righteous, and valued friendship. He usually did many things to help people in the yamen, which fit the saying "It is good to practice virtue in the yamen." His colleagues all respected him, and the people in the county who knew him also respected him. They did not call him by his name, but called him the Righteous Man Wang.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanbo refused to shave his hair and was beheaded. He died loyally and righteously. Those who knew him all sighed and shed a few tears. Xu Yuanbo's death was not enough. His wife was also exiled, which made people feel even more pity and anger.</p>
<p>When Xu Yuanbo was imprisoned and had not yet been beheaded, the Righteous Man Wang wanted to save him. But he was just a yamen runner, and it could not even be said that he was "a low-ranking official with a small position." What ability did he have to save Xu Yuanbo? He could only watch helplessly as the executioner took Xu Yuanbo's head from his neck and watched helplessly as Xu Yuanbo's wife was exiled! Alas! The escort was also assigned to the Righteous Man Wang.</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang received the document from the county magistrate and walked onto the street, thinking to himself, "It's good that I was assigned, so that Mistress Xu won't suffer on the road. Alas! Such a loyal and righteous person as Xu Yuanbo was killed by these muddleheaded fools. Killing him was not enough, they also had to exile Mistress Xu! Alas! I wanted to save Xu Yuanbo before, but I had no way to save him. Now that I am escorting Mistress Xu, I must find a way to save her."</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang walked and thought, and before he knew it, he had reached his own home.</p>
<p>Until late at night, the Righteous Man Wang had not yet thought of a way to save Mistress Xu. Originally, this was not an easy task. He was the escort and could not casually release the prisoner. There was only one way: to find another woman to impersonate Mistress Xu so that Mistress Xu could be released. This was a good method. But where to find such a person? Who would be willing to give up their comfortable life and go to suffer for others? This was truly the most difficult thing in the world.</p>
<p>This matter troubled the Righteous Man Wang. He did not sleep well all night, but tossed and turned in bed, sighing. The Righteous Man Wang was usually not like this, but today he suddenly acted this way. Madam Wang could not help but be surprised, so she asked, "Why are you so restless and sighing?" The Righteous Man Wang was only thinking about his own business and did not answer her.</p>
<p>Madam Wang asked again, "What is the matter?"</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang said, "It is not something that you women can handle."</p>
<p>Madam Wang said, "Don't underestimate me just because I am a woman. Tell me what is the matter, and perhaps I can help you think of a way."</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang was at a loss. Hearing Madam Wang say this, he thought, "It would be good to have someone to discuss with." So he told her the reason why Xu Yuanbo and his wife had committed crimes, and that he wanted to save Mistress Xu.</p>
<p>Madam Wang said, "You admire Xu Yuanbo's righteousness and want to save his wife. That is what a real man would do. It would be great if we could find someone to go for Mistress Xu."</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang said, "Yes! But where to find such a chivalrous woman to suffer for Mistress Xu? That is what is troubling me."</p>
<p>Madam Wang listened, and remained silent. After a while, she said to the Righteous Man Wang in a serious manner, "I am willing to go for Mistress Xu. Saving people should be thorough. Saving Mistress Xu will also fulfill you. I am willing to go for Mistress Xu!"</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang never thought that his wife would give up her comfortable life and go to suffer for others. But this was too difficult. He still did not quite believe it, so he asked Madam Wang, "Are you telling the truth, or are you just joking?"</p>
<p>Madam Wang said, "Who is joking? I am really willing to go for Mistress Xu. You can be a real man, can't I be a female hero?"</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang quickly turned over and got out of bed, kneeling on the ground and saying, "Virtuous wife! You are truly a heroine. You have fulfilled me!"</p>
<p>Madam Wang also quickly got out of bed, kneeling on the ground and saying, "We are all doing this to save good people, to save those who are wronged. Why do you have to be like this?"</p>
<p>Immediately, the Righteous Man Wang went to the prison, brought Mistress Xu out, and went home with her. After sitting down, the Righteous Man Wang explained that he admired Xu Yuanbo, wanted to save her, and that Madam Wang was willing to go into exile for her.</p>
<p>Mistress Xu was very surprised and said, "My husband committed a crime, and I am exiled. It is all our fault. Not to mention suffering, even if I die, I should bear it. How can I trouble you, Madam! Absolutely not!"</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang said, "Mr. Xu is a loyal and righteous man. Who in the county doesn't sigh? If I don't save the wife of such a person, who else should I save? Madam, don't refuse. My wife and I have already discussed it."</p>
<p>Mistress Xu said, "Absolutely not! Even if you, Madam, are willing, I will feel uneasy! Absolutely not!"</p>
<p>Madam Wang said, "I have already made up my mind. Madam, whether you want to or not, that's how it will be!"</p>
<p>Mistress Xu saw that the Righteous Man Wang and Madam Wang were so determined and had no choice but to cry and bow to the ground, saying, "Thank you both for your kindness. I can only repay you in the next life!"</p>
<p>The Righteous Man Wang immediately sent Mistress Xu to her parents' home and hid her.</p>
<p>Madam Wang took Mistress Xu's name and went into exile. She endured countless hardships and sufferings along the way. It took her several months and she walked thousands of miles to finally arrive. Afterwards, the people of Rugao County all admired the righteousness of the couple. Everyone pooled together a sum of money and went to the place where Madam Wang was exiled to redeem her. The Righteous Man Wang and his wife were reunited again.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jizhen</p>
<p>Undeterred by lightning during thunderstorms, he experimented with electricity. Over seventy years old, he journeyed across the ocean to plead for his people.</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, America, on January 17, 1706. His father was a dyer, originally from England, who immigrated to America. When he first arrived in America, he already had seven children. After his wife died, he remarried and had six more. Franklin was the youngest of his sons. Franklin's mother was kind and capable, very good at disciplining her children, creating a harmonious atmosphere of parental love, filial piety, brotherly affection, and fraternal respect.</p>
<p>At the age of eight, Franklin was sent to a village school by his parents. At that time, America was just a British colony, culturally backward, with no higher education institutions, only a few village schools teaching basic reading and arithmetic. Franklin, upon entering the school, realized that studying was not easy, and worked hard, achieving excellent results. His father, seeing his son's understanding, happily said, "This son of mine will surely become a pastor." Because pastors at that time were very knowledgeable and respected, he had such expectations for his beloved son. Unfortunately, due to the large family size and limited income, his father's financial situation worsened day by day, and he could not afford to support his son's education. After two years in the village school, Franklin was forced to drop out and work as a child laborer making soap and candles with his father. There, he paid attention to everything and gained much experience.</p>
<p>One day, his father took him to Boston for business. He saw the prosperity of various industries, with everyone diligently working in their respective fields. He was deeply moved and said to his father, "Dad! I like this hopeful city of Boston. I want to stay here and learn a trade. Dad, will you agree?" At this time, Franklin's brother, Jacob, had opened a printing house in Boston. Hearing Franklin's words, his father could not bear to refuse him and sent him to this printing house to learn printing. Franklin worked and studied, asking questions about everything he was unsure of, learning everything with great humility and diligence, and his studies progressed rapidly.</p>
<p>Jacob was a jealous and stingy person. Not only did he not cherish his good brother, but he also mistreated him severely. Franklin worked for Jacob for seven years, and Jacob did not give him a single penny of wages. Jacob was also worried that Franklin would not be willing to be his slave for life, so he took precautions and notified the nearby printing houses not to hire his brother. Initially, Franklin thought that his brother was just stricter than others and did not suspect any malicious intent. Later, he discovered all of his brother's treacherous schemes. He was disappointed and determined to leave. So, he quietly sold all his belongings, took the little money he had, and ran to New York, three hundred miles away. There, he had no reliable relatives or friends, and could not find a job as a printer. He went without a full meal for several days.</p>
<p>One afternoon, he was wandering the streets, hungry and desolate, trying to find a place to work, when he suddenly saw an advertisement from a printing house in Philadelphia seeking workers. He considered this a savior and immediately prepared to go. After struggling there for several years, he managed to make a living. While running the printing business, he also engaged in scientific research. Soon, he invented the copperplate and the stove. At this time, he had become an important figure in society. After gaining his own position, he remembered the difficulty of his early education and therefore paid great attention to public education, first running a newspaper and a library. Later, he was afraid that this would not be enough to thoroughly benefit the people, so he entered politics. At the age of seventy, he crossed the Atlantic twice to England to request the abolition of the Stamp Act for the American people, but unfortunately, he failed. He had to abandon his political life and concentrate on studying electricity, changing his approach to benefit the people. At that time, the American people truly lived up to him. Their petitions were ineffective, so they armed themselves and resisted, seceding from Britain to establish independence, creating a great power later on. After American independence, he once left the laboratory to represent the American people, lobbying various countries to seek recognition. He first moved France to recognize them, and other countries followed without objection. He was a great founding father of the United States.</p>
<p>Franklin began studying electricity very early on. After years of meticulous experiments, he officially invented "electricity" in 1752. That year, one day, dark clouds gathered, and thunder and lightning roared. He believed this was the best opportunity for him to experiment with extracting electricity from the clouds. He immediately put down everything he was doing and prepared for the experiment. He first used a piece of silk to make a kite, inserted a foot-long iron wire, then tied a string to it, and launched it into the clouds. He also tied an iron key wrapped in silk ribbon to the end of the string. Because silk does not conduct electricity, holding the iron key through the silk would prevent electrocution and death. He waited for a while, but besides the thunder in the sky becoming louder, there was no reaction. He doubted his procedure and was very anxious. Seeing the flashing lightning in the sky, he wished he could reach out and grab it. Just as he was extremely disappointed, a heavy rain suddenly poured down, completely soaking his clothes. He shivered constantly in the rain, but he did not retreat. He thought to himself, "If the electricity experiment cannot succeed, what is there to cherish about the body? If I cannot find any answers today, let the thunder and rain destroy me! I do not plan to go back..." Just as he thought of this, the string below the kite, which was originally very slack because it had been soaked by the rain, suddenly tightened, and sparks constantly flew from the iron key in his hand. He was not afraid at all. He looked at the lightning in the sky and then at the sparks in his hand, and happily said, "Electricity, I have indeed invented you. Before, I said that electricity could be extracted from the clouds, and lightning could be avoided, but all the great scholars in the world laughed at me for 'daydreaming.' Now, I have finally proven it! It shows that if people are willing to work hard for the truth, they will definitely not fail to achieve results."</p>
<p>Although he discovered electric sparks, he was not complacent and satisfied. He was unwilling to take the kite back to change his clothes. He shivered and speculated about the wet kite string: "Why didn't it conduct electricity at first, and only conducted electricity after being wet by the rain? Is it that the string itself does not conduct electricity, but becomes conductive when wet by water?" Later, after careful research, he learned that there are electrically conductive ions in rainwater, so the string can conduct electricity when wet (because carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in rainwater to form carbonic acid, and carbonic acid decomposes to produce positive and negative ions. These positive and negative ions can conduct electricity. Even water itself can decompose to produce positive and negative ions, but the amount is very small.)</p>
<p>Since Franklin invented electricity, later scientists have been able to use his electricity and his principles of electricity to invent telephones, telegraphs, electric lights, trams... for the benefit of the world. The benefits he gave to humanity are truly unparalleled.</p>

<h3 id="e208">How to Cultivate an Academic Atmosphere (Part 1) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>If we examine the current situation in China, the shallowness of the academic atmosphere is an undeniable fact. Whether in families, schools, or society in general, during leisure time, there is only low-level entertainment, with no proper cultivation of virtue; during work, there is only a decadent philosophy of opportunism, scheming, and infighting, with no diligent research from an academic or work perspective. This phenomenon pervades ordinary families and occupational groups. Even in most large and small schools, it is the same, with no distinction between superiors and inferiors. Therefore, assuming that the shallowness of China's academic atmosphere is due to the lack of basic education is a misguided assessment. The general truth of China is that people do not want academics, rather than desiring to study but being unable to. We should pay serious attention to this point. The author believes that the formation of this phenomenon has its own cause and effect. Therefore, to hope to cultivate a national academic atmosphere, we must start from its root cause.</p>
<p>Why do people serving in professional lines not need to study academics? Because they did not get this position entirely relying on their knowledge and talent, but rather relying on direct or indirect personal relationships. At the same time, maintaining this position and even promoting their position also does not entirely rely on their knowledge and talent, but rather relies on their ability to maneuver. We often hear people say, "The essence of dealing with people lies in 'feng ma niu'." If the secret of life is 'feng ma niu', then what is the need for academics? The author had a friend studying engineering abroad who studied for five full years overseas, mortgaging almost all of his family property, but failing to attain a high position after graduation. He interned in foreign factories for five or six years. He originally did not want to return to his home country, because he knew that his home country only needed 'feng ma niu' and did not need hard-working people. But his friends admonished him with great righteousness, believing that he should serve his home country and should not contribute his talents in a foreign country. This overseas student was repeatedly urged by his friends, and he returned home with his luggage. Unfortunately, this Chinese overseas student, who only knew how to study academics and did not understand human relationships, ended up dying in poverty and illness in a hostel in his home country. We certainly cannot say that there is not a trace of justice in Chinese society, but at least what pervades Chinese society in general is personal connections, and there is little guarantee of a livelihood based on academics. What a terrible phenomenon this is! Thus, fathers and elder brothers often admonish their children and younger brothers to be familiar with human relationships, and the children and younger brothers encourage themselves to deeply study 'feng ma niu'. The whole world is like this, and human desires are rampant. How can we still talk about whether the academic atmosphere is shallow or not?</p>
<h3 id="e209">A New Era of Popular Reading <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Gaoyong</p>
<p>"National Novel Series" Published by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>Recently, Zhengzhong Book Company, in order to promote social education and meet the needs of the public, specially commissioned many experts to compile two series of National Novels, a total of one hundred volumes. The content is divided into ten collections: 1. History Collection, 2. Revolution Collection, 3. Geography Collection, 4. Famous Biography Collection, 5. Health Collection, 6. Production and Economics Collection, 7. Politics Collection, 8. Defense Collection, 9. Science Collection, 10. Life Collection. Using the style of chapter novels, it narrates various knowledge that is truly relevant to the people. Anyone who has studied for one or two years can easily read it and develop interest. This is indeed a great contribution to social education! A friend sent me the fifty volumes that have already been published, which gave me many thoughts after reading them.</p>
<p>I remember when the so-called drum song master Liu Baoquan came to Shanghai half a month ago, one night a friend and I went to listen to Liu tell stories. Liu's opening remarks after taking the stage said: "The material for storytelling, no matter who it is, is nothing more than 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms', 'Dream of the Red Chamber', 'Romance of the West Chamber', 'Water Margin', and other novels. If you leave these novels, then no one can sing or tell stories, so past and present, it's nothing more than stories of heroes and beauties." At that time, I had a question after hearing this: Why can't we compile stories about things that are closely related to modern times and the public as material for storytelling? Why is it still using a few old novels as the only material even today? What help do these outdated stories give to the current actual life of the general public? If we compiled many events in history, such as Lin Zexu banning opium, Zeng Guofan suppressing Hong Yang, the Boxer Rebellion, the Eight-Nation Alliance attacking Beijing, the Wuxu Reform, the Huanghuagang Uprising, the Xinhai Revolution, and the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, into interesting stories as material for storytelling, wouldn't it be more meaningful for the general public to listen to?</p>
<p>We also often see in the newspapers that some young people in various places read absurd and unbelievable supernatural novels and believe them to be true, so they hide it from their parents and siblings, and flee together to some mountain to seek gods and learn swordsmanship. We should never always say that these young people have simple minds and immature thoughts; in fact, the influence of so-called popular novels on people is too profound. When young people are in the prime of their desire for knowledge, and there is no proper reading material to meet their needs, they have no choice but to read supernatural novels.</p>
<p>Let's look at the plays performed in several theaters in Shanghai recently. It's either "Burning the Red Lotus Temple", or "Journey to the West", or else something like "Pan Jinlian and Widow Ma's Inn", nothing but gods and monsters, or lewdness, and they can actually be full every day, with one play running for a month or two without stopping. And most of the audience are petty citizens who fundamentally lack modern knowledge, so the impact is such that the results are truly unspeakable.</p>
<p>From these things, we cannot but say that the public life in China is too dangerous, and social education in China is too lacking. If we want to revitalize the nation at this moment, we first need to modernize our country. If we want to modernize our country, we must first modernize the thinking of the people. If we want to modernize the thinking of the people, we must pay great attention to social education. The work of social education is of course multifaceted, and compiling a kind of popular reading material suitable for the times is currently the most needed work.</p>
<p>We know that for many years, the authority that has dominated our social public is not the Bible or sage texts, but rather a few popular novels; not Confucius, Mencius, Zhu Xi, Wang Yangming and others, but rather Kongming, Guan Yu, Song Jiang, Wu Song and others. The so-called "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", "Water Margin", "Dream of the Red Chamber", and other popular novels, although they still have their literary value today, their content is already somewhat incompatible with the lives of the general public today. Therefore, if we want to enable the public to obtain a basic knowledge that adapts to modern life, and cultivate a lifestyle that adapts to modern society, we must have a new reading material that is easily accepted by the public. The National Novel Series of Zhengzhong Book Company can be said to have been compiled in response to this need.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more people have been paying attention to popular reading materials, such as the collection of folk songs from various places, and the textual research of various folk legends, which are often seen in newspapers and magazines. However, this kind of collection and textual research work is useful for people who study learning, but not very useful for the general public with shallow knowledge. For example, if we investigate the evolution process of the story of Xiao Chu Xu Wenchang, people who study history and literature can know the evolution of a legend, and develop great interest, but the general public who only knows how to read has no such research interest at all. Therefore, for popular reading materials, on the one hand, we need scholars with deep thoughts to collect and research for us to serve as research data, and on the other hand, we also need people with fluent writing skills to systematically edit them for the public to read. The compilation of the National Novel Series should meet the needs of the public.</p>
<p>I have read through the fifty volumes of National Novel Series that have already been published, and I feel that there are the following points that can be praised:</p>
<p>It adopts the genre of chapter novels, so that a fact is connected from beginning to end, forming a complete and systematic story, which is exactly what those who are used to reading old chapter novels like.</p>
<p>The narration is simple and clear, without the excessive elaboration of old novels, so that people with a shallow level of knowledge can easily understand and remember.</p>
<p>It transforms specialized scientific knowledge into concrete stories, so that readers can unknowingly gain a lot of scientific knowledge while reading the stories.</p>
<p>It turns ideal things into realistic stories, so that people feel that many beautiful lives can be obtained in reality, and people unknowingly tend towards a reasonable life.</p>
<p>The above four points are the points that I personally feel satisfied with after reading them. I very much hope that people who are enthusiastic about social education will continue to compile more popular reading materials like this. I also hope that literate citizens who have studied for one or two years will save the time and money they spend listening to storytelling and reading comic books, and buy some of these kinds of reading materials as spiritual food.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to offer a reading experience from my past as a reference for those who compile and purchase this kind of book. I remember when I was in elementary school, the Commercial Press was publishing a series of books for young people, which contained stories of famous people from China and abroad, with simple words and pure content. The books were small and cheap. I bought one book every week as extracurricular reading. After reading more than twenty books, my thinking was greatly influenced, and I didn't even want to read "Water Margin" and "Dream of the Red Chamber" anymore. Today, the Young People's Series has become an outdated thing, but the influence I have received has not disappeared, while the so-called "Dream of the Red Chamber", which was once popular, I still have not fully read. Therefore, I very much hope that the influence of the National Novel Series on the general literate public will be the same as the influence of the Young People's Series on me personally.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Is This the Gentleman's Demeanor of England? <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Seeing the incident of the British Consul in Yunnan, Harding, committing assault without reason, and injuring a training officer of the school's Boy Scouts, really makes people feel very indignant! According to the Kunming telegram from the Central News Agency, the Boy Scouts of the Provincial Commercial School were going to visit the British Garden. They stopped in front of the gate and first instructed the gatekeeper to report inside. At that time, the British Consul Harding happened to be in the garden. Upon hearing the news, he brought out two hunting dogs. Then, three Boy Scout training officers went forward to state their intentions. Unexpectedly, Harding, with a fierce demeanor, without distinguishing right from wrong, without saying a word, immediately used his cane to beat the people indiscriminately, and cursed loudly. His hunting dogs were also eager to bite. All three people who were beaten were seriously injured.</p>
<p>From the course of this incident, it can be seen that this British Consul Harding's act of assaulting people is truly tyrannical to the extreme! The school's Boy Scouts wanted to visit the British Garden. They stopped in front of the gate and first instructed the gatekeeper to report inside, which is not comparable to those who enter without permission. If Harding looked down on Chinese students, or had other reasons for not allowing outsiders to visit, he could have refused. But he suddenly showed off his power, brought out two hunting dogs, with a fierce demeanor, without distinguishing right from wrong, without saying a word, and used his cane to beat the people indiscriminately and cursed loudly. This kind of rude behavior really goes against the identity of a consul. Does Harding view the fact that Chinese school Boy Scouts want to visit the British Garden as an insult to the dignity of the British? Or was he just drunk at the time, so his actions were so abnormal? However, according to Harding's defense to our country's negotiators, he said that his assault was a proper disposition. Randomly beating and cursing people is still considered a proper disposition. What exactly is the logic behind this?</p>
<p>Incidents of foreigners in China assaulting Chinese people without reason have been heard from time to time. Not long ago, an American sailor assaulting a Chinese person case occurred in Shanghai. Now, a Boy Scout training officer from a school in Yunnan Province has been assaulted by this British Consul Harding. But in the past, most of the people who committed the assaults were foreigners without status. But this time, the person who committed the assault was the British Consul, who is a diplomat. This is what makes us unable not to be astonished! Moreover, it is said that Harding has a violent temperament and has committed assaults many times in Yunnan. Such a diplomat truly goes against the dignity of England. England is known as a nation of gentlemen. Is this the gentleman's demeanor of England?</p>
<h3 id="e211">After Watching "Lady Windermere's Fan" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Performed by the China Traveling Theater at the Carlton</p>
<p>Following "Thunderstorm", "La Traviata", and "Melody Lane", we also saw the China Traveling Theater's "Lady Windermere's Fan."</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, especially in</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In the difficult month of May, staging plays like "La Traviata" already made us feel that the plays were too soft; and now, they are staging this outdated "Lady Windermere's Fan." Coming from North China, the China Traveling Theater, has it forgotten the current situation in North China that it witnessed and experienced?</p>
<p>What do we see in an outdated play like "Lady Windermere's Fan"? It is the depraved and boring lives of the gentlemen and ladies of the upper class, those games of love...</p>
<p>If exposing the depraved and boring lives of the upper class and adding severe criticism is originally not impossible. But "Lady Windermere's Fan" is obviously not like that. Here, drinking, playing cards, talking about women, and opening dance parties are only used as decorations for upper-class figures. It is a kind of praise rather than criticism. Even if there is some so-called subtle satire, it is only subtle satire. Its function is originally the same as a familiar friend saying "haha" and making a joke.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, "Lady Windermere's Fan" is not just a "haha". There are even greater toxins behind it—</p>
<p>A woman abandoning her child and eloping behind her husband's back is not a terrible crime, in my opinion. Of course, running away after losing a husband who "loves" her and her lovely children is a very big sacrifice in private relationship. If the new object plays with it for a while and then throws it away, it will be even more unfortunate; However, I still do not give Nora much sympathy for her departure, and I think that she is right to go? So, a character like Xu Ziming is not much better than Lord Windermere, although the one who encouraged her to elope is the same as Xu Ziming.</p>
<p>Ms. Jin advises her daughter, Xu Shaonai, to return to her husband's arms, which may be right in a certain sense, but what is she advised to go back to do? To be a new virtuous wife and loving mother. She is only advised not to lose her original master, who treats her very well, like her, if she loses her original master who treats her very well (?), she will end up "wandering and destitute, with a bad reputation".</p>
<p>This is just advising people to compromise with the old and not resist! The new will not be better than the old!</p>
<p>Although it is said that Liu Boying in "Lady Windermere's Fan" will not be better than Xu Ziming, it may be a fact, and Xu Shaonai has no ability to do anything other than be a "toy wife". However, what are the audience under the stage considered to be?</p>
<p>What kind of preaching is this!</p>
<p>As for the performance, the stage design is quite beautiful. Among the actors' acting skills, Jiang Ming's Ba Daren is the most popular (I hope he can reduce some of his anger). Tang Ruoqing and Zhang Manping performed very steadily. Dai Ya's Xu Ziming is very suave in his movements, but his voice is too old, perhaps because he is used to playing old people; Tao Jin's Liu Boying is not enough, and Tan Wen's Zhang Yizhi also performed too exaggeratedly.</p>

<p>— Black Ding</p>
<p>He still wanted to say more. He looked up and saw me standing nearby. Immediately, he looked embarrassed, left the bed, approached me, and whispered, "Oh, you, when did you get back?"</p>
<p>Before I could answer him, suddenly, my relative, as if unable to bear it, loudly interrupted, "Think about it yourself, you come here again and again, and every time you say you want to improve, have you improved? When you can't afford opium, you shoot morphine, you inhale heroin. You, at such a young age, don't want to be a human being. You've sold the house and land. You tricked your wife and children into going to Lushun, and you hardened your heart and sold them. You still have the nerve to come back and say they abandoned you..."</p>
<p>I sadly looked at the window.</p>
<p>He was scolded by his uncle and burst into tears. He tugged at my clothes and said, "I really want to quit this time, but I have no money, alas..."</p>
<p>After speaking to me, he looked at his uncle timidly with pitiful eyes. Like a child, he wiped away his tears with his hand and said, "Just this once, give me some money, and I'll never come to you again..."</p>
<p>Finally, his uncle took out eight dimes from his pocket and placed them in his hand. He looked satisfied, walked out the door, braved the rain in the dark night, and disappeared into a grove of trees.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, three days later, he was brought back by two policemen with his hands tied behind his back, again looking for his uncle. As soon as he entered the house, he knelt before his uncle, crying and begging, "Brother, brother, I'm so wronged. I was implicated by someone. They said I stole something that someone else stole... Please write me a guarantee so I can get out."</p>
<p>His uncle pushed him out the door.</p>
<p>The two policemen kept slapping him in the face and loudly cursing, "You motherfucker, you said you had someone to vouch for you, but they pushed you out the door... Go, go, go back to jail..."</p>
<p>Half a month later, it was heard that he had died in prison.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Tiger's Mouth <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>The vast sky was a milky white, as if smeared with a layer of gray. The fiery red morning sun reflected a few sparse morning stars, making them appear even dimmer. The lapping of the water sparkled with hundreds of silver snakes, making it hard to open one's eyes. In such a morning scene, apart from occasionally hearing a few croaking sounds of frogs, it was difficult to hear other sounds. Everything quietly slept in the embrace of tranquility. Even the few fishing boats by the sea were as silent and peaceful as if there was no one on board.</p>
<p>Toot! ——</p>
<p>But that sound startled everything. The fishermen abruptly woke from their dreams, touched their dirty, oily faces, stretched, and the croaking of the frogs became noticeably louder, incessantly chattering. In the forest, the little birds chirped and hummed. The gentle breeze blew through the grass, as if amplifying the sound waves a bit. …Thus, the sea surface became as lively as if it had transformed into something entirely different.</p>
<p>Toot! —— The sound seemed to come from something black emitting smoke. While shaking the ship's body with a "hong ya hong," it went——Toot! ——Toot!</p>
<p>This time, Grandfather Shun was raising money for the village to build a wall. Everyone in the village was penniless; who could afford to pay for the wall? Fortunately, someone in Shanghai had made a fortune, so Grandfather Shun dutifully took the donation book and went to raise money, collecting nearly a hundred foreign coins—no, it should be national currency now—and happily boarded the ship back. At this moment, he stared blankly at the white bubbles on the water, lost in thought, chewing on a vague memory:</p>
<p>It was sometime ago that a feng shui master had visited Shijia Village. According to his conclusion after surveying the surroundings of Shijia Village, the feng shui of Jinjia Village was indeed excellent, but unfortunately, it could not withstand the tiger's mouth of the Jinjia Ancestral Hall. It was like a tangerine with only a little bit of rot, perhaps harboring endless future troubles. It would be best to build a wall in front of the ancestral hall to block the tiger's mouth. Otherwise…</p>
<p>But who would believe it? Shijia Village had once experienced a period of prosperity. They dismissed the feng shui master's unreasonable and absurd words as a gentle breeze by their ears, rolling their eyes at him. Seeing that he seemed to be a hopeless case, he staggered away.</p>
<p>However, Shijia Village had indeed been acting strangely lately. The clan elder Ying died. The nimble Sister-in-law A Long, the honest A Qing, A Fu... they all died suddenly! What was left? People like Rongfa, Houfa, A Shui, A Bing... were all rogues, nothing but strong and overbearing fellows who only cared about eating. Under these circumstances, Shijia Village declined day by day.</p>
<p>Toot!—— The ship arrived at the dock, cutting off Grandfather Shun's thoughts.</p>
<p>Back home, he eagerly prepared to open the ancestral hall for a meeting.</p>
<p>Things became difficult. The farmland in front of the ancestral hall happened to belong to Uncle A Chang, who was a notorious skinflint. His mind was filled with selfishness. He didn't care about anything. As for attending this meeting, he was there because he thought his land might be sold for a higher price.</p>
<p>"Is that so? Uncle A Chang, you don't need to worry about the money. Now, we just need you to allow four fen of land, just four fen is enough. We'll buy it from you, and then we can start construction."</p>
<p>Of course, Uncle A Chang quoted a shocking price. And A Shui stood up abruptly from the bench:</p>
<p>"Uncle A Chang, that's not gold land either. No outsider is as black-hearted as you. Think about it, we're doing this for everyone. You should also fulfill some obligations, right?"</p>
<p>Uncle A Chang just smiled coldly, moved his lips, raised a hand like a twig, stroked his mustache, and coldly said nothing.</p>
<p>Bang! It was Houfa who slammed the table and roared:</p>
<p>"What's the point of talking to such an unreasonable person? Grandfather Shun, you quickly find a way to handle this. If anything goes wrong... Hey! Uncle A Chang, you hear me, everyone heard me, this is Houfa speaking. If I go back on my word, I'll be a son of a bitch. Understand? You tell me."</p>
<p>"That's right! Grandfather Shun, you do your thing. Are you afraid he won't agree?" A Shui also raised his fist and banged it on the table.</p>
<p>So, A Bing, Rongfa, A Dong... one by one, they made a commotion. Uncle A Chang finally yielded to an extremely low price in an extremely tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>Soon, a short, whitewashed wall was built in front of the Shijia Ancestral Hall. From then on, the people of Shijia Village could no longer see that terrifying tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>However, Shijia Village continued to decline day by day...</p>
<h3 id="e214">Immortal Zhang <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Zhang Er of Huangzhen is now respectfully called Immortal Zhang.</p>
<p>Huangzhen hasn't had a good harvest for three years. Old Man Liu San, who sits in the teahouse every day, grumbles that because there hasn't been a temple fair for three years, this is retribution. In the end, he blames the young people: "Those young fellows, where did they hear those wild rumors? If they continue to destroy temples, Huangzhen will turn into a land of hungry ghosts."</p>
<p>In fact, the young people also respected and believed in General Meng, but for three years, the fields haven't yielded enough, and the granaries are pressing hard to collect rent. After a year of hard work, they still have empty stomachs. What spare money do they have to honor General Meng with a procession in a red silk sedan chair? General Meng is powerful and should bless Huangzhen with several bumper harvests, pay off the debts, and fill their stomachs. Everyone would happily put on a three-day temple fair. But as soon as spring arrived, there wasn't a single grain in the pot, and the capital for planting hadn't been secured. It was truly a dream for General Meng to ride in a red silk sedan chair. The young people drank a little wine and thought about destroying General Meng's temple, letting them destroy themselves, and letting Huangzhen die clean!</p>
<p>Old Man Liu San was, after all, old: "Don't act rashly. General Meng certainly doesn't know that there hasn't been a good harvest for three years. He hasn't gone on patrol, so how would he know the condition of the fields? Somehow, everyone scrape together some money for a small temple fair. When General Meng sees this situation, he will surely show great compassion, and this year will be a good harvest..."</p>
<p>These words were what everyone longed for in their hearts, so they scraped together a sum of money, and General Meng was carried out of the temple.</p>
<p>That day, the faces of the men were filled with smiles, like a good sun after a rainy day. They casually cleaned up the temple, which was covered with spiderwebs. General Meng was invited out of the shrine. The person in charge of the invitation was naturally Old Man Liu San. When he helped General Meng into the sedan chair, he silently prayed in his heart, "General Meng, Huangzhen is too poor. There hasn't been a good harvest for three years. The sedan chair hasn't been replaced with new red silk. I beg General Meng to bestow blessings, to bring a five-shi harvest this year (an ordinary mu of land can yield three shi of grain; five shi is a great harvest). Next year, we'll gild him and decorate him, and put on a three-day opera." He bowed his head deeply, touching his forehead to the cold floor tiles. The men and children of Huangzhen, as long as they were male, fell down behind Old Man Liu San like logs, each with a desire in their heart, silently praying, a dream of a five-shi bumper harvest floating in everyone's mind.</p>
<p>Outside the door, a cannon sounded, and everyone cheered and stood up. Four men grabbed General Meng's sedan chair and rushed out. Those people followed behind, but they couldn't catch up with the sedan chair. Only when the sedan chair had circled every field bank in Huangzhen and returned to the temple did everyone follow back to kowtow. Then, the person in charge of the invitation helped General Meng back into the shrine.</p>
<p>This year, because of the path-clearing ceremony, the four men carrying the sedan chair, driven by the dream of five shi, carried it back to the temple as if their eight legs had wings. But when Old Man Liu San wanted to help General Meng into the shrine, he discovered that a person was sleeping in the shrine, with white foam at the corner of his mouth and his eyes slanted in the corners, as if he had died.</p>
<p>It was Zhang San, a good-for-nothing character in Huangzhen who, after gambling and eating away the few mu of land left by his ancestors, wandered everywhere.</p>
<p>"You wretch! You wretch!" Old Man Liu San scolded.</p>
<p>The men carried Zhang San down. He woke up, opened his eyes wide, and said in a foreign accent, "What are you doing! I know Huangzhen hasn't had a good harvest for three years. You kindly invited me to go on patrol. I promise you'll have a five-shi harvest this year."</p>
<p>The men were stunned. But Old Man Liu San immediately had a flash of inspiration. He knew that General Meng had possessed Zhang San's body. He knelt down with a thud and kowtowed repeatedly. The men immediately fell to the ground like logs again, shouting about the power of General Meng.</p>
<p>When Zhang San woke up, he was almost scared to jump up. He wanted to escape out the door. Old Man Liu San held him down and told him that General Meng had possessed his body and wanted him to live in the temple from now on. General Meng still had words to be conveyed through him.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>So Zhang San was respectfully called Immortal Zhang. He lived in the temple, receiving food and clothing from the people of Huangzhen. When he went out, he swaggered and received the kowtows of the crowd. When someone in the town was sick or had some difficulty, they would go to Immortal Zhang. He would immediately slant his eyes into the corners, foam at the mouth, speak in a foreign accent, say some medicine names, and think of ways to help them.</p>
<p>But a month later, Immortal Zhang disappeared. Old Man Liu San ordered the men to search everywhere. They found him in a gambling den in a neighboring town. He was happily talking about his act of playing a god. He boasted about his clothes, his money, and that he was now a very rich man.</p>
<p>Zhang San was carried back to Huangzhen by the men, beaten half to death. The men's dream of five shi had been shattered. They wanted to vent the resentment of not having a good harvest for three years on Zhang San. That night, they tied Zhang San to General Meng's shrine and set it on fire.</p>
<p>After that, Old Man Liu San, who sat in the teahouse, silently chewed on his dry tobacco pipe…</p>

<p>Weige Di, the wife of the farmer Sorld, sits in the house embroidering. It must be nearly dusk! At this time, the bright sunset shines through the window and strokes the embroidery, arousing Weige Di's endless reveries...</p>
<p>"My lover drowned in Laojian, Laolan! I originally wanted to forget you forever"...</p>
<p>She uncontrollably uttered a moving dirge.</p>
<p>Naturally, when her husband returned, he didn't like hearing such a song.</p>
<p>Sorld said she was "meowing."</p>
<p>Sorld came back from the fair in disappointment, looking unusually irritable and embarrassed. It seemed like everything offended him.</p>
<p>Ah! He tiredly lay straight down on a box to rest, waiting for his wife to prepare dinner.</p>
<p>He had heard a murder case from the crowd at the fair.</p>
<p>A man named Hao Er was stabbed to death on the beach. The person who killed Hao Er was Solov, his welcome cousin.</p>
<p>While the two were talking about how pitiful the murderer would be, Wiege Di hoped that her cousin hadn't killed Hao Er....... At that moment, a voice came from outside the door: "Do good, save me!"</p>
<p>It was the murderer Solov who came in, panting... He refused to let his cousin kiss him. He thought that his cousin would not recognize him as her cousin because she knew that he was the one who killed Hao Er.</p>
<p>However, his cousin didn't mind at all.</p>
<p>Naturally, since they were both human, why should Solov be bullied by Hao Er? In Solov's opinion, killing Hao Er was a fair fight.</p>
<p>Now, he asked his cousin to hide him for a night or two. But his cousin was a woman, and she thought that "women are not suitable for doing such things." But after all, because they were siblings, she hid him in the sheep pen.</p>
<p>In contrast, Sorld was afraid of this matter. He worried that hiding Solov would be disadvantageous to him. He was simply afraid to the point of crying. He knew how Hao Er's brother Angel would come to search his house, which would put his own life in danger....</p>
<p>Should she really watch her cousin – Solov, who might be in imminent danger - and not save him? She despised her husband's courage.</p>
<p>However, Angel finally came knocking urgently on the door.</p>
<p>Angel forced Wiege Di to step aside.</p>
<p>After some insistence, Sorld, who had been afraid to the point of crying, sold Solov out to Angel for three silver marks.</p>
<p>This made Wiege Di truly anxious. While they were all upstairs, she quickly locked her cousin in the box.</p>
<p>How could they let this go? We will have to see the wisdom of this brave cousin.</p>
<p>Listen, Wiege Di will give you a very satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>Reception Banquet for Three Pairs of Artists Performances with wonderful jokes</p>
<p>Tang Na, Lan Ping; Zhao Dan, Ye Luqian; Gu Eryi, Du Mingjie; After these three pairs of artists returned from their weddings in Hangzhou, they hosted a reception for relatives and friends at the YMCA in Baxianqiao last night (the 5th). At this tea party, it was truly a gathering of stars and artists. There was endless excitement and interesting stories. Now, let's put aside the main topic and record some anecdotes below, so that those who did not participate in the event can also know some of the "artistic sentiments" of that time on paper. (Using old Teng's language)</p>
<p>Shen "Monster" Xiling, who originally taught in Guangxi, came to Shanghai on official business and happened to participate in the grand event. This gentleman, who came from the southern country of Erythrina red beans, brought many red beans (this object is the most reminiscent of love). At the banquet, whenever he met a friend, he would give each person two, to express his feelings of longing.</p>
<p>Someone, not knowing who, said that red beans could be eaten. Jiang Dongliang couldn't wait to swallow the red beans into his mouth. At that time, someone happened to be reciting the poem "Red beans grow in the southern country," and when they recited the last line, "this object is the most reminiscent of love," they pointed at Mr. Jiang, causing the whole hall to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>While this side was having a good time, old Teng dragged Ling Hefu to see Chen Bowan to introduce them. He himself pretended that he didn't know either of them, performing with great skill and appearing to have the talent of a comedian.</p>
<p>The master of ceremonies, Mr. Shi Chao, had to not only raise his voice to announce the program but also ask the guest representatives to ask the bride and groom to report on their love stories. He performed in all aspects and with many jokes, winning the support of the guests.</p>
<p>The seats were arranged very well, in pairs. For example, Hu Die and Pan Yousheng were a pair, Chen Wanli and Wu Mei were another pair, and Wang Ying and Jin Shan were also arranged together.</p>
<p>After the representative of the new couple, Dian Na, gave a speech, it was the guests' turn to speak. Ouyang Yuqian was chosen as the representative. Mr. Ouyang bombed as soon as he came on stage, reducing the three pairs of newlyweds to two pairs (perhaps on purpose). As soon as he said the words, he knew he had made a mistake and immediately corrected himself, but it had already caused the whole audience to laugh uncontrollably. The gist of his speech was: "In such an unfree environment, there is actually such a free union. And with such free air now, I am truly happy. In the future, I hope that the newlyweds and the guests will unite and seek freedom together in this unfree environment." (Later, Zhou Jianyun and others also gave speeches, with the same general meaning.)</p>
<p>After the guests gave their speeches, one of the newlyweds, Zhao Dan, returned from outside. Everyone asked him to speak. After he spoke, Gu Eryi was also pulled up. He was wearing a hat, and people asked him to take it off, but he was unwilling. Suddenly, Zheng Junli, like a tiger, darted out from the side, grabbed his hat, and ran away. This is how the truth was revealed. It turned out that he had recently shaved the hair on the top of his head for filming "Carnival Night," so "the bald man was afraid of taking off his hat."</p>
<p>After the grooms finished their speeches, naturally someone suggested that the brides should also say a few words. So the negotiation commissioner, Shi Chao, said, "Wait a minute, let me go and smooth things over." As a result, he did not fail in his mission, and the brides came out one by one to say to the guests, "I am truly happy today. I can't express how happy I am… Thank you all." Then they quickly turned around and fled into the lounge. When it was Ye Luqian's turn to finish speaking and step back, a friend suddenly struck a gong next to her. The sound of the gong was exactly the same as the adjutant's report in "The Imperial Envoy" that the real imperial envoy had arrived.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another rose. Mr. Zhou Jianyun raised a serious protest over there, saying, "They didn't hear the words of the bride and groom clearly and requested them to go to that end and say them again." This protest later came to nothing because someone else proposed that the newlyweds report on their love stories.</p>
<p>Again, after the negotiation of the negotiation commissioner Shi Chao, the three grooms came out to report on their love stories. Zhao Dan said, "Love between men and women is always so and so, that's all, that's all." Shi Chao said, "Since Zhao Dan said 'that's all, that's all,' we'll call 'that's all' to report."</p>
<h3 id="e219">"Iron Horse" Soviet Russia's Latest Amphibious Tank <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>He had already reported it more bluntly, saying, "I fell in love with her at first sight."</p>
<p>Tang Na said, "I love her, and she loves me."</p>
<p>Someone else suggested that Commissioner Shi Chao be asked to invite the bride out to report on their love story. Shi Chao gave the guests a hint, saying they were "over there" (in the women's restroom), and requested a female representative be sent to ask. The result was nothing came of it.</p>
<p>Next was the giving of gifts. Flowers were passed down each table, one by one, and whoever had the flower when the drum stopped would win a prize. The first group, starting with the middle table, winners were Zhang Yiping and Mao Yu! The second group, Chen Wanli; the third group, Xu Huaisha.</p>
<p>The first group's prizes were a small flower basket and two small umbrellas. While Mao Yu was playing with and admiring the small umbrella, Shu Xiuwen unexpectedly snatched it from behind. Mao Yu, being "young and handsome" and quick on his feet, dodged the attacker, but unexpectedly, the front door was blocked by a tiger, and the back door by a wolf. Qian Taisheng snatched it from that side. Qian Taisheng got the small umbrella, and Shu Xiuwen demanded it from him, resulting in a comedic scene of Qian Taisheng teasing Shu Xiuwen three times. In the end, it was still returned to Mao Yu.</p>
<p>Just as the music program was about to begin, Xu Suling suddenly suggested that Ouyang Yuqian be asked to sing Pan Jinlian; Hu Die be asked to sing "Night Fragrance"; and Old Teng be asked to give a speech.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian said that his voice wasn't good and he couldn't sing. Moreover, the play "Pan Jinlian" might have sold well when I sang it ten years ago, but now Bai Yushuang should take the limelight.</p>
<p>Hu Die also couldn't sing because her throat had just recovered. As a result, only Old Teng came on stage and gave a speech with a rather "artistic" tone of "so, this, that."</p>
<p>It was getting late, and the music program began. It included Miss Lang Yuxiu's solo singing: "Serenade," "Three Grievances of the Rose," and a violin solo by a national music expert. Someone asked Miss Wang Ying to sing a Japanese song, but Wang Ying preemptively refused to sing.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone sang together the "Six Harmonies Wedding Song Congratulation Melody," with lyrics by Sun Shiyi and music by Ming Ji: "Amorous man, with bride, shadows paired beneath the Six Harmonies Pagoda; Victory in the field of love, do not forget the barbarians reaching the Yangtze River, do not forget the barbarians reaching the Yangtze River!" "Drink celebratory wine, create a joyous wedding chamber, the tide of May is high and the momentum is rising; Together go to the battlefield, together save China and recover Shenyang, together save China and recover Shenyang!"</p>
<p>It was reported to be eleven o'clock, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
