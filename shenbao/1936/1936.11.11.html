<h3>X光檢查下的福建（下）</h3>
<p>— 廣雅</p>
<p>福建內在的病象，無須像外感一樣地細加叙述；一言以蔽之，「民窮財盡」而已矣，這雖老生常談，但例證却是很鮮活的。</p>
<p>「民窮」包括着農村的經濟破產，和都市的工商凋敝。「財盡」可代表官廳財政收支的不平衡，雖不惜殺鵝求蛋，而每月收支的不敷，還多至二十餘萬元。以故該省當局前所宣示的政治標的「安定與建設」，以及近來積極推進的統制政策」，都不容易收到很圓滿的效果，原因也多由於難爲無米之炊。有時還因羅掘彌補關係，引起其他不良影響。如閩南某大繁華縣，月收花捐數額可觀，某駐軍機關請撥作補助費，財廳認爲無異截其生命錢的一端，堅持不可，於是某駐軍機關便卜令禁娼（？），停徵花捐，我旣不得，你也不有，兩方竟因而不相諒如此。財政困難苦衷，可以畢見。</p>
<p>民窮的現象，有一位曾任閩北某師特別黨部助理員，兼任閩第一綏靖區政和縣保壯整訓指導員的朋友對人說：「閩北的老百姓，眞窮極了！我到各地去指導組織保甲訓練壯丁時，奉命所需經費，是向人民隨地捐收，每戶二角，赤貧酌免，可是一般老百姓，同是飢餓綫上的人，誰非赤貧？眞是無法鑒別。要免收，便得大家免收，但經費又無從籌措。有些竟把預備給產婦吃的雞蛋，都送來作代價，眞慘極囉！」收捐人而至憫憐老百姓，嘆爲「眞慘極囉，」則老百姓眞窮至如何程度？不難可以想像得之。</p>
<p>民窮的反映，允覺比民窮的現象可怕。有位在閘北作糧食調査工作的專員，對閩北地方行政的前途，抱着無限的悲觀說：「各縣已經釀成「老百姓怕政府，政府也怕老百姓」的嚴重的局勢了！」（見閩省統計時報二卷二期）的確，在中國老百姓怕官廳是天公地道，官廳怕老百姓却是一件奇聞。記者不久以前，經過閩北，汽車司機吿訴我說：「因軍隊集中於主要交通綫，乘汽車到不怕搶，但離城市稍遠的鄉村，就不保險了。尤其是一般屠宰烟酒和什麼附加稅等經徵機關的人員，更簡直不敢出城下鄉，否則難免危險。」這不是政府怕老百姓的現象麼？</p>
<p>閩北各縣，有所謂大刀會的組織，本來是人民的自衛集團。會民在先都是馴良農民，曾帮助政府，剿滅赤匪，立功鄉里。可是後來都相繼匪化，而與政府過不去了。什麼原故呢？就是前門打退紅軍，後門又來苛雜壓迫，遂把他們逼上梁山去了。他們的身份，是介於民匪之間，人數旣難統計，蔓延又無顯然界限，所以收拾很不易。若用大軍去剿辦，往往誤殺良民，甚至更惹起良民的疑慮，再參加　會匪」的活動。只好按淸剿辦法（九分政治，一分軍事，）實施復甦民生的善政。換句話說，就是要實實在在的减輕民間負擔，然後人民不但决不匪化，卽已鋌而走險的，也將相率而歸，仍操正業了。倘如上月間，福州沿海島嶼漁民代表晋京請願團報吿書所說的：「財廳一方廢除魚稅漁業稅，一方又巧立名目，另徵海味業營業稅，並另創收閩侯鮮魚客販敎育捐。最近於全省契稅又附加五成……」則離减輕人民負担的話還差得很遠呢。</p>
<p>其决閩南民軍的不易解决，也與民生疾苦問　，大有關係。所謂民軍，好像是保衛人民的民力；但閩南各縣的民軍，却大多數是土匪集團的化名，他們的組織和武器，較間北會匪還厲害。現在已有一大部份收編成保安隊，還有一部份勢力，老不就範。據保安處人員談：「未收編的民軍槍械，尙的有十萬。」推其所以難於剿撫的原故，「民窮爲寇」，固是一個主要原因，可是過去的官方，往往借招撫之名，然後又突然嚴辦其首領，解除其武裝，道常然也可說是一種策略成功，但也有他的缺陷，就是兎死狐悲，引起他部的自危而頑抗。</p>
<p>此外，有些人（特別是官廳客籍人員）曾這樣地說：「福建一旦有事，漢奸一定很多」。固然，平時有人肯掛洋牌，是一個例子。其實除眞存心甘爲奴隸，唯利是圖的奸商之外，其餘一般「無所謂」的愚氓，我們便得很客觀地替他們想一想：若政府有辦法、減輕捐稅；甚至能取銷不平等條約，幷沒什麼治外法權的誘致，還有掛羊牌而認賊作父的麼？</p>
<p>這裏還有幾件佐證；閩北蒲城，有個小學生，愛國自殺後，記者適經其地，見一般的民氣，都非常激越。又嘗到延年福州厦門等處圖書館參觀，親見閱覽人案前所置的書類，大都爲東北事變，長城戰役，淞滬戰爭，以及歷史上與中日問題有關的畫報及專書。福州名勝鼓山上的寺壁救亡的標語，更是琳瑯滿目。（地距城三四十里，故得各言爾志）可見八閩人士，心目中幷不曾忘了那麼一回事。</p>
<p>又如南滿鐵道會社，前派員測勘安溪鐵礦及通海口的鐵路綫時，官方雖已允許，但卒因當地（距海峯稍遠）民衆的激烈反對，致路綫僅測了一段而中輟。調查安溪鐵礦的，有一决更爲了民軍威脅，在夜中「逃之夭夭」。閩北要隘的延平，間南重鎭的龍巖，萬一沿海有事，這兩地就司一躍而成全閩得失局勢的要律。某國人常請護照想去看，但實際去的却寥寥無幾，據延平區專員公署中人談：「幷非官廳不予保護，實際還是他們心虛不敢去」。至於一般浪人的作惡，也不敢擅離沿海縣雷池一步。</p>
<p>有一位，閩南民軍領袖陳國材，他以前逃到香港後某方知道他的潛勢力，便追着去運動他，說他替中國政府作事値不得，若肯加入某某大同盟，便將有如何的大發展。但他的答語非常乾脆；「寗願給自家人打耳光，絕不願讓外人打手心」！後來他又覓回鼓浪嶼，承同業某友的介紹去看他，問他民軍活動甚力，傳授某方利用，眞相如何。他說：「借運動民軍的名，去騙某方的錢，果然有人幹過。至謂民軍會願做遺臭萬年的漢奸，是萬萬不會的。迫不得已，也只有當土匪的一路」，我覺得這一席話到也是由衷之言</p>
<p>最可怕的是，如某國駐平特務機關「侵略華北之秘密政治報吿」，中有云：「大部份浪人的活動，已非常有效。這愈顯出支那官府的苟安和無能，增加民衆對官府的怨恨和失望」。不幸福建而果亦有此現象，這却成了內感不治之症。然以福建目前實情來說，我想不會得罷。　總而言之：福建病象，雖有內外之分，可是眞正作祟的病魔，却是兩位一體，譬如該省的癥結所在的財政困難，和人民負担不能减輕的問題，就是受了外感病症「走私」和浪人搗亂的大影響。新任駐俄大使蔣廷黻氏首途出國時，臨別演詞有云：「一國外交，决非『乞憐』『叩首』的方式所能成功。……『上』『下』團結一致，對外不肯輕讓，我國方有出路」。福建不欲除外感，醫內傷則已：若欲立起沉疴，奮發有爲，起碼也應當照着蔣氏的話做去！（完）</p>
<h3>滿鐵積極　推進新增資金計劃　由明年度實施六年完成　金額共達七億二千萬元</h3>
<p>大連通訊、滿鐵自今春擴張發行社債限度、樹立的五億一千萬元爲基礎之資金五年計劃、其後未幾、又有第四次鐵道投資及關係事業擴張增產計畫等新投資條件、以日政府未付股金之繳納爲前提、並必要再建資金計畫計、滿鐵總裁松岡、曾赴東京對於日政府繳納股金事、進行折衝、又將今春樹立之五年計畫、附入爲新　金計畫內、對之取追加之形式、至其所定實行資金計畫之再建、經滿鐵研究結果、社內事業、不加何等變更、專於社外投資部門、承認投資之膨脹、基乎此意而立社債政策、而其新資金計畫、據觀自日本昭和十二年（明年）度以降、至昭和十七年度終爲止、凡六年間、已决定方針如左、</p>
<p>（一）第四資鐵道投資二億二千萬元、</p>
<p>（二）滿洲炭礦會社增資四千萬元、</p>
<p>（三）昭和製鋼所增資一億二千萬元、</p>
<p>（四）興中公司改組及增資等、對此之投資、其總額爲　三億元、</p>
<p>然而滿鐵之在東北投資、非祗以上而已、此外又將實行者、如擴張煤液化事業、開發東北產業、參加五年產業計畫及爲培養新錢，北滿農地開發等外，尙有開發華北經濟資金等諸問題、，必欲促成樹立三年度滿鐵資金計畫之趨勢、滿鐵已考盧此點、於具體化前、在以上諸投資之定見下、着手第四次資金計畫、</p>

<h3>何懷德的談話</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>美國報界巨子何懷德日前在馬尼刺發表了一篇很可注意的談話。他根據着近年來銳敏的觀察。把當前中日兩國的局勢十分坦率地剖示出來。語氣之間對於中國民族的自覺和進步。寄與着深厚的同情。何氏是美國報業兩大領袖之一。在這决美國大選中何懷德系的報章靄力擁護着羅斯。福和赫斯忒系相對立現在羅斯福獲得壓倒的勝利。聯任總統了。他和多數的美國人對於中日問題採取着怎樣的觀點。此後的美國外交有着怎樣的趨勢。我們在何懷德的談話上不難看出一些線索來就這點來說。何懷德的談話實在是和史汀生所著的「遠東的危機」有着差不多相同的意義。</p>
<p>何懷德氏在這决似乎有作用地所發表的談話上。强調着中國的進步與統一他說「中國對於日本已表示堅决之立塲急轉直下之局卽在。目前歐美各國對於中國完成復與與統一一鳴驚人必須刮目相看。易言之歐美人士以前對於中國之判斷與估價必須重加調整矣」他又引了三年以前中國人民贈與軍隊的大刀和上星期蔣委員長五十生辰各地民衆所呈獻的大隊飛機作着對照說是由此「可覘中日局勢演化之過程一言以蔽之中國睡獅已醒矣」。這種口吻不但對於「中國的堅决的立塲」。表明了深切的同情。而且更重要的還對於世界列强警吿着它們勿再把中國當作沒出息的半殖民地來看待當然。我們中國人是應當憑着充分的民族自信心用自力來奮鬥不能因一位外國友人的幾句恭維而沾沾自喜的但是我們總該想一想置身局外的友邦人士對於我們的復興精神。尙且那麽熱烈地喝着采鬥爭中的我們應該怎樣的淬厲奮發才好。</p>
<p>何懷德氏的談話上還有很可注意的一點。就是他直率而且淸晰地說明了當前中日交涉的局勢他說。「日本現所提出的兩項基本條伴一為共同防赤一為正式承認華北特殊地位。第一條須承認日軍得在中國各地與中國軍隊合作此無異承認日軍駐華為合法權利至第二條實卽破壞中國統一中國均難承認」。中日調整國交的談判到今日已經經過了七次。可是在根本上似乎還沒有什麽具體的結果。其癥結所在顯然正如何氏所說是日方提出的兩項某本條件這兩個條伴侵害着中國的主權和領土。足使我們民族陷於萬刦不復的地位在我們的確是不能容忍的。可是我們還得明白。為了全世界人類的福利從整個的國際局勢着眼。我們也萬萬不能接受那樣的兩個條件。在當今的世界德意所代表的國際法西斯勢力正在企圖着爆發一個人類空前的大慘禍西班牙的內戰就是顯著的徵兆。日本和德國早已成立了軍事上的諒解。它的堅持共同防共顯然根據於進攻蘇聯這一個意志。而它的要求華北特殊地位顯然就是整個大陸政策的階梯。兩者的終極目標也可以說是在安排廣大的侵略陣綫。來挑發世界大戰現在歐洲的國際舞台上。法西主義的氣焰雖然表面上很熾盛。其實普遍地存在着的國際民主勢力只要能够好好兒集合起來。一定可以抑住那種破壞性的氣燄的。在這樣的國際局勢中間。我們依附於破壞世界和平的勢力走向殖民地的運命呢。還是堅守着獨立國的地位。來維護世界的和平與安。定這兩條途徑是很容易抉擇的。何懷德氏說到中日交涉的局勢。沒有表明出這一種世界的意義來。但是我們郤不難看到何氏對於中國的同情多少有些根據於這一種意義。因為今日的美國正是國際民主勢力的一個重要國家啊。</p>

<h3>川剿匪軍事結束　建設事業益形急進　　省府積極清理田賦　建廳計劃開闢新河</h3>
<p>成都通訊、近來川中要人、如行營主任顧祝同。參謀長賀國光。第一辦公廳長韓德勤。及川省財政特派員關吉玉、先後來省、訪晤劉主席、有所商洽、旋復返渝、川財政廳長劉航琛。建設廳長盧作孚。亦相繼來省、劉盧兩氏、以任務關係、經常奔走京滬渝各地、在省時間甚少、此次返省、曾數度晋謁劉主席、面商各項問題、聞所商內容、大致爲川省善後、建設·財政·諸端、茲將情形分述於决、</p>
<p>剿匪軍費　停止撥發</p>
<p>川省勦匪軍費、自行營在川成立後、卽交由中央與地方當局所共同組織之財務監理處統籌、數額核定爲每月二百萬元、經費來源、原係就糧稅附加三倍、卽徵糧一年、附加勦匪經費三倍之數、不足之欵、由行營呈請軍委會撥欵補充、分配辦法、係按參加勦匪部隊、分逕勦與助勦兩種劃撥、從去年度起、此項勦匪附加、卽實行徵收、由各縣徵收局按月繳解財監處、再由財監處於每月月終轉發勦匪總部、分撥於勦匪各部隊、惟勦匪經費自開徵以來、因拖欠甚多、每月實收之數、平均僅的一百五十萬元、按照行營核定之數目、尙差的五十萬元、此不敷之欵、係由中央撥欵補充、但以目前情形而論、殘匪早已遠竄、各部亦均復員、勦匪軍事、旣吿結束、對各軍勦匪軍費、自無再行發放之必要、經顧主任賀參謀長等與劉主席商定、已由剿匪總部及督辦署、會銜通令各部、從十一月份起、停止撥發、用節國帑、至參加陝甘邊區剿匪部隊、現已撥歸張副總司令指揮、此後所應領之剿匪軍費、概由行營籌欵直接撥發、</p>
<p>清理田賦　彌補軍費</p>
<p>剿匪軍費、自本月份起、實行停止撥發、其在地方上所徵收之剿匪附加、事實上自須停止徵收、不過川軍自統一後、每月開支之軍費、多恃此項剿匪附加、以資補助、如一旦停徵、則於軍費上不免發牛恐慌、究應如何設法彌補、聞當局已籌有辦法、據傳在此過渡期中、剿匪附加、仍暫時徵收、一方面則積極淸理田賦、將來卽以淸餘之糧欽、抱注軍費、蓋川省糧稅、在過去防區制未打破前、雖多至一年五六徵、但對地方田賦、從未淸理、以是漏糧甚多、將來淸理完畢、實行按糧徵稅、則省庫收入、將增加二千餘萬、又川省糧稅、現雖係一年一徵、但加上剿匪經費三倍附加、實等於一年四徵、故入民負擔、仍未减輕多少、當局此次淸理田賦、是爲將來實行一年一徵地步、旣裕省庫、而又顧到軍費問題、且可减輕人民負擔、避免糧多稅少糧少稅多之弊實一舉數得之計也、</p>
<p>建設公債　抵現成功</p>
<p>川省財政、因應付歷年剿匪軍事之開支、早已竭澤而漁、自匪衆遠竄後、一兩年來、省政不敷之欵、全恃公債維持、去年曾發行二十四年度川省善後公債一種、數額爲五千萬、以之辦理善後一切庶政、尙不敷的一千萬之譜、本年度又呈請中央發行川省建設公債四千五百萬、業經批准、先發三千萬元、其餘一千五百萬、則俟明春續發、至此項公債用途、並經規定以一千萬償還二十四年省預算不敷政費、以二千萬充作建設、內中以八百五十萬修築成渝鐵道、四百五十萬興修公路、共餘之七百萬元、則充作發展實業之用、此項公債、已開始發行、關於貼現事宜、劉航琛·盧作孚·兩氏、已分向滬銀界接洽成功、據談爲每千萬以現金四百萬抵現、合全數計算、不過現金一千二百萬元、在此省財政極度枯竭時、以此項現金、辦理各項建設、僅能勉强應付耳、</p>
<p>開闢新河　偉大計劃　　關於川省建設問題，除着手興修成渝鐵路外、聞建廳尙有一偉大計劃、在岷沱兩江之間的灌縣地方、鑿河一道、緣沱江與岷江、本係由都江堰分出之內外兩大河流、夏時洪水暴發、外江時有汜濫之虞、內江水勢較小、然以之灌溉川西廣大之農田、其水量則有戚於不能充分分配、建廳爲調節兩江水量計、擬在兩江之間、開闢新河一道、將外江之水引入內江、消極的可以消除水息、積極的可以發抒其灌溉農田之力量、將來兩江貫通後、並計劃引用內江大量之水、在成都安設自來水管、建廳方面、已與上海華洋公司接洽、先派一代表來省調査、聞該公司已派定雲伯爾君爲代表、定四日偕總工程師一人乘機飛省、進行一切、在水利方面、建廳當局、誠用過一番苦心也、惟鑿河工程、至爲艱鉅、所需經費、爲數亦不少、聞當局俟計畫擬妥後、卽呈請省府核定、着手實行、</p>

<h3>日紗廠工潮擴大　大康等廠加入罷工　昨晚發生紛擾工人兩名被捕　工方擴大請願黨政調查真相　華商上海印染廠昨亦一度怠工</h3>
<p>大公社云、滬東區日商上海。同興。東華。等七紗廠、全體工人、仍繼續罷工、昨日臨靑路上海第六廠。騰越路大康紗廠。全體工人、響應加入罷工、並與探捕發生衝突、黨政機關派員、會同調査、全體工人、决推派代表、舉行擴大請願、未罷工之日商紗廠公大等、紛紛招收新工。高郞橋華商上海紡織印染公司、亦發生怠工風潮、茲經大公社記者、探誌各情如决、</p>
<p>日商紗廠工潮</p>
<p>兩廠響應　日商上海第一·二·三·四·五·廠、同興第二廠·東華等七廠。全體一萬五千餘男女工人、自發生聯合罷工後、經各部各班工人頭目。與廠方談判結果、因廠方對五項條件不能承認、故全體工人、昨仍繼績罷工、平凉路臨靑路上海第六廠男女工人八百餘人、於昨晨六時起、亦一律出廠、加入罷工、楊樹浦路騰越路大康紗廠男女工人四千餘人、於昨日下午五時半、亦響應罷工、</p>
<p>發生紛擾</p>
<p>昨日午後六時、大康紗廠日夜班工人放工上工之際、突有日商上海第一·二·三·廠男女工人五千餘人、成羣結隊、混入大康紗廠內、勸阻工人上工、楡林路捕房。格蘭路捕房。聞訊後、立派大批武裝中西探捕、及紅色警備車·機器脚踏車隊、及日本陸戰隊士兵。馳往彈壓、當時人衆龐雜、形勢嚴重、忽有人投擲石塊、擊破西捕頭部、致一時秩序大爲混亂、當塲拘獲工人兩名、一面將工人驅散、始漸吿平息云、</p>
<p>黨政調查</p>
<p>市府當局、對此次日商上海紗廠等罷工事件、頗爲關懷、希望勞資雙方接近談判、俾早解决、本市市黨部·社會局。總工會張楚强·包伯義等、於昨日分赴楊樹浦路平凉路等各日商紗廠調査工人罷工眞相、再商妥善辦法、進行調處、以免風潮擴大、</p>
<p>擴大請願</p>
<p>各罷工日商紗廠工人代表、於昨日下午三時十五分鐘、在虹口區某地舉行會議、商討應付辦法、會議內容未詳、惟據大公社記者、向各方探得確息、工人方面認爲廠方無誠意接受條件、故每廠推派代表、定日內赴市黨部。市政府。舉行擴大請願、並以各日商紗廠工人聯合代表名義、向本市各界呼籲援助、</p>
<p>各廠招工</p>
<p>未牽涉罷工漩渦之楊樹浦路公大。大康。裕豐、滬西區內外棉。豐田。喜和。同興第一廠·日華等各日商紗廠及英商怡和紗廠。特在各處張貼通吿、招收經紗細紗熟手男女工人各數百名、又華商申新各廠。永安。鴻章。上海紡織印染等各廠、亦均紛紛招收新工工作、</p>
<p>紗市平穩</p>
<p>昨日紗布交易所市塲開收盤之紗價、甚爲平穩、甚且各期均回小二三角、花衣市價一因現貨擁擠、一因日商紗廠罷工後、罷工各廠。均不定貨、致花價每擔下跌三角至三角半、昨據紗廠業領袖榮宗敬語往訪之大公社記者云、市塲紗價甚平穩、因我華商各廠、爲保守商業道德、不爲日商紗廠罷工影饗、而抬高市價也云云、</p>
<p>船津表示</p>
<p>大公社記者、於昨晨十一時許、赴外灘正金銀行四樓晤在華日商紡績業聯合會會長船津、詢以上海紗廠等罷工後、聯合會應取之態度、及其解决途逕、由南忠三接見、當據渠代表船津、發表意見云、工人此决罷工、向廠方提出之五項條件、係屬傳單宣言類似、不能認爲正式條件、故昨日聯合召集各廠負責人商談、爲交換意見而已、並無具體决定、本會一方面靜觀其事態之演變、一方面通知各廠、以和善方法、與工方共謀商協解决、聯會爲維護同業利益、當設法妥籌辦法進行、以冀風潮早日消弭云</p>
<p>工方態度</p>
<p>又據罷工工人方面之態度、關於工人之苦痛情形、已在聯合吿各日商紗廠書中詳細說明、此次罷工、實出於逼不得已、祗就工資而論、從前織布廠做四部機工資、每期的十八至十九元、而現在做四部機工資、每期僅給八元至九元、細紗前做八十木桿、工資九元、現在做九十六桿、工資仍舊九元、搖紗從前搖六十車、一期工資八元至九元、現在搖一百餘車、工資反减爲七元至八元、不但每日無休息、且每日吃飯時仍開車、生活猶如牛馬、工人等爲謀改善生活待通計、特提出五項條件、均屬正當、不達目的、誓不復工、尙懇各界垂憐工人痛苦、予以援助云云</p>
<p>華商紗廠情形</p>
<p>申新五廠開工</p>
<p>申新紡織總公司、所屬宜昌路第二廠·華德路第五廠·自委託中國上海兩銀行管理後、經設立管理委員會、籌備開工後，現第二廠紗錠、迄昨日止、已完全開足、第五廠亦於昨日開工、淸花鋼絲兩部份、先行工作、至粗紗部份則定今日開工、</p>
<p>一八兩廠糾紛</p>
<p>又滬西周浦鎭申新第一第八兩廠、範圍頗大、前因紗業不景氣、存貨堆積、故該廠實行减工扣薪、勉强維持、照今年紗銷旺盛、營業極度發達、故工方要求恢復原薪、以資改善生活、經由十區棉紡工會、呈請黨政機關核辦、昨日上午下午、由社會局第三科召集調解、勞資雙方施行調處、由朱金濤主席、經宣布調解意旨後、繼由勞資雙方代表聲述理由因雙方意見未能接近、致調解未獲結果、當由主　宣布、於今日繼續調處、</p>
<p>印染廠昨怠工</p>
<p>滬東華德路一三八二號、上海印染紡織廠紡紗間女工一百二十餘人、現工資每天三角八分、茲因紗業已見起色、故向廠方要求每天增加工資九分、計每工四角七分、但未獲廠方允許、故於昨日上午六時起、實行怠工、該管捕房聞訊、當派探捕前往彈壓、秩序甚好、茲悉該廠方將與三方直接進行談判、允加工資、午前卽吿復工云、</p>

<h3>對於國運會之幾點小貢獻</h3>
<p>— 喬劍花女士</p>
<p>讀國貨運動聯合會爲推進家庭訪問工作公告婦女界一文，至誠愷切，令人感涕，國難日迫，凡我女界，亟應奮起，共挽危機，以盡國民天職，「服用國貨，」尤爲我人天職之天職，義不容辭，本母待乎勸告，無如奸商輕義重利，洋貨充斥市塲，婦女見短識淺，允易爲所朦蔽，以致形成喧賓奪主之局面，每念及此，良用痛心，茲就一得之愚，縷述數點，以備國運會諸君子之採擇焉。</p>
<p>一，各女訪問員，終日奔走呼號，唇焦舌敝，收得效果，當已可觀，但聞有一部分家庭，往往厭惡麻煩，對於訪問員，拒不接見，鄙意遇此關頭，須請訪問員改從下層入手，每至一家庭，先將各商號優待券遞給僕婦，述明購買何種貨品，得便宜若干金，何種物件，可得贈品××，囑其隨同訪問員卡片先行呈獻，並代鼓吹，（聲明不取分文，亦非募捐，祗求晤見，）倘蒙接受，卽可爲進身之階，遇見時進言，宜簡潔明瞭，切勿嚕囌。</p>
<p>二，近世習尙奢靡，都市男子，每喜穿西裝，而西裝之色料，大都取决於主婦，此層可商請章華。海京等呢絨廠，多印九折或九五折優待券，（或其他贈品券，如製衣一套，得贈日用品等類，）隨同呢絨樣品附送該主婦，（不穿西裝者免送，）〇以引起其穿着國貨呢絨西裝之興趣，一面設法使各西服店多備國產呢絨衣料，以供選擇，定製時持優待券來者，照例得享權利</p>
<p>三，請主婦們保藏國貨公司或其他國貨商店內所購純粹國產品之發票，滿若干銀數以上，得享受何種利益，（此點請會中先行計劃詳細辦法後施行，）</p>
<p>四，勸告各廠商，製造產品，應精益求精，勿因貨品已能行銷，而即行使其偷工减料之慣技，例如××鉛筆，本年上學期，一般學生試用滿意，下學期始，木料條鉛，均大不如前，（木料粗毛，鉛質脆裂，）學生未免有厭用之心。</p>
<p>五，女訪問員工作，似可不限於家庭，有時便道可至各學校，勸吿校內負責敎師，請於課內課外，隨　訓導學生，服用國貨，學生愛國情緒，更較熱烈，允易收效，如本人執敎×校，隨時隨地，灌輸民族意識，講述救國方法，最低限度，須做到人人服用國貨，結果大受感動，但曾詢學生，可有他位敎師，亦照樣現身說法，據查實居少數，足見大多數敎職員，尙未注意及此，是以勸吿敎職員之工作，亦不容或緩也。</p>
<h3>怎樣參觀國貨展覽會？</h3>
<p>— 姚成軒</p>
<p>（一）觀察這是不能避免的常事，便是開什麼展覽會，允其是國貨展覽會，有許多人，熙攘往來的所謂軋鬧忙，軋鬧忙是不是應有的態度？我想不論任何人，都要加以非議嗎？開國貨展覽會，它的使命是何等的重大！它的用心是何等的深苦！我們莫說國貨展覽會，便是很平凡的一個什麼展覽會，都應當抱着觀察的態度，而况乎不是開玩笑的會呢？所以我們假使頭腦淸晣，懂得一些世故人情的話，都知道中國人處處地方馬馬虎虎，嘸啥要緊，看國貨展覽會，，如走馬看花，用不到觀察態度，諸位呀！這是錯覺，是絕對的不良心理，希望親愛的同胞們，提起觀察的精神來，這樣才能算不愧來參觀國貨展覽會呢！國貨展覽會對你才會發生關係呢。</p>
<p>（二）批判什麼事物觀察了以後，心中便起了一種感想我們看到陳列着的五花八門的國貨，應當有公正的批判的感想，覺得我的批判公正正確，不妨向主持國貨展覽會的機關，或是刊載國貨方面的報紙副刊或別種的雜誌，刊物等等，貢獻一點意見，使得國貨事業，國貨運動，不斷地向着前程邁進，我們看到歐美人，看了什麼展覽會以後，都有很忠實的批示，供諸他們的國家，這也可說是人民應有的義務，也可以從這一點上表現出東西各國，他們愛國心的差異和程度的高下，我們希望來參觀的老老少少，男男，女女，都要負起批評的責任來，替國貨前途增光，「他山之石，可供切錯」，這是古人的話，却是否們的金玉良言呢</p>
<p>（三）創造這創造兩字，驟見之好像和參觀沒有關係，其實不然，我們參觀了國貨展覽會之後，如覺得某種國貨有改良的必要，自己覺得以我的知識，能力，技術，能够脫去它的輪廓，創造出更好的國貨來，那是更好沒有的事了，中國近年來，因了硏究科學的人們，孜孜矻矻的從事創造，所以發明的物件也不少，這是非常可以喜悅的一件事，我很希望一般來參觀國貨展覽會的人們，用着觀察的態度，正確批判的態度，來得到創造的美果，諒有識之士，不以吾的謬見爲荒謬絕倫嗎？以上三種，是很容易被參觀的人們所忽略所以突地把牠們提出來，作諸君在參觀國貨展覽會時的參考。</p>

<h3>公務機關與購用國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國民政府行政院於三日二八六次會議通過一公務機關購用國貨暫行辦法」五條，此爲中央提倡國貨以來最有決心最有效力之舉動，在提倡國貨史上最值得紀述之一事，茲先叙述辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）凡公務機關公用物品，須儘先購用國貨。</p>
<p>（二）實業部將各機關通用物品造具國貨清冊，分送各機關選購。</p>
<p>（三）未經立案之國貨工廠，由部飭地方國貨運動聯合會査明轉飭登記。</p>
<p>（四）某地某廠出品如査明非國貨冒充國貨售出者，該機關因無法報銷，所受物價之損失，商號應負責賠償。</p>
<p>（五）各機關特殊所需物品，及學術試騐及技術工作上特別需用之物品，在無國貨代替，而必須用外貨者，應詳細聲叙理由及事實。</p>
<p>如各機關違背上項規定，一律以不經濟支出論不准核銷。</p>
<p>吾人於此，應注意者有四：</p>
<p>第一　公務機關之庶務員，自後採辦公用物品，務須儘先購用國貨。有國貨可用而採用外貨者，以前僅爲不愛國，受良心之譴責，道德的制裁。自中央頒布此項辦法以後，更進一步，爲不經濟，爲違法，爲不准核銷。爲公務機關之庶務員者，千萬注意，幸勿疏怠，而自貽伊戚。</p>
<p>第二　其實儘先購用國貨，豈僅公務機關，凡全國之工商敎育機關，如銀行，如公司，如工廠，如商號，以及學校等，與夫自由職業之醫師律師會計師等，均應以購用國貨爲應有之職責。</p>
<p>第三　實業部旣造國貨淸冊分送各機關選購，惟於此須注意嚴防者，爲改頭換面之非國貨，藉此混跡其間，現在市上牟利之奸商，往往外貨充作國貨，以欺罔用戶，故淸冊所列應絕對嚴格。凡有疑問之貨品，寗缺母濫。否則提倡國貨，適爲奸商開牟利之門。而負責調査之國貨聯合會等，更不可稍涉寬濫，徇情誤事。</p>
<p>第四　依照第四項辦法：「某廠出品，如査明爲非國貨，冒充國貨售出者，以該機關之無法報銷，所受物價之損失，出售之商號，應負責賠償」。此點極爲公允，以後販售物品之商號，對於國貨與非國貨之抉擇，不可不審慎，更不可不嚴格。吾人認爲以非國貨而作國貨售出者，當揭載報端，與衆共棄。該號之營業，當然不能維持。以是今後各地應在政府指導之下，宜徧設純粹之國貨公司，以便利各公務機關之採用。</p>
<h3>一週內國貨新訊</h3>
<p>國民政府行政院於二日議决公務機關購用國貨暫行辦法七條，嗣後各機關購辦公用物品，如有國貨而仍用外貨時，其支出欵項，審計部不予核銷。</p>
<p>行政府令實業部迅卽籌設統一國貨公司，派程覺民君來滬籌備。</p>
<p>婦女服用國貨會，定今日舉行成立會。</p>
<p>全國手工品藝品展覽會定二十六年五月一日在京開幕。</p>
<p>南洋商業考察團已自新加坡經西貢返國，在十五日左右可到滬。</p>

<p>一·民族復興的微象最近以來、我國人民、因爲政府當局的注意訓練、以及各界志士的熱心呼號、確已有了很大的進步、前天國民政府林主席到滬發表談話、也深感欣慰的表示、此次蔣院長壽辰、全國人民踴躍輸將、購機獻國的熱情、卽足證明國人對於國家的觀念、已有進步（註一）這種熱烈的國民情緒與精神的表現、無疑的是象微着、</p>
<p>我們萎靡的睡獅、已經</p>
<p>開始覺醒、</p>
<p>我們散漫的民衆、已經</p>
<p>有了中心、</p>
<p>我們垂危的國運、已經</p>
<p>有了轉機、</p>
<p>我們老大的民族、已經</p>
<p>開始復興、</p>
<p>這種精神、這種情緒、如果能够繼續的維持着、並且能够普遍的發揚起來、一定可以為蔚爲一種力量—一種偉大的磅礡的力量、有了這種力量、一定可以克服當前的國難、一定可以打開民族的生路、但是、歷史的敎訓、却允爲可貴、前事不忘、後事之師、幼稚的樂觀、往往就是悲劇的誘因、我們國民的情緒、並不是從來不會興奮過、祗是以往的興奮、是一時的、是局部的、是表面的、而不是持久的、不是普遍的、不是出諸內心自覺的、事過境遷、便歸消散、「五分鐘的熱度」、便形成了今日半生不死的局面、凡是眞正關懷國運的人、孰不痛惜、遠者不必論、小者不必論、祗就慶祝北伐完成一事來說、當時情緒的熱烈、非但無遜於今日、卽列强的報紙、且用特大字標出、認爲睡獅的中國、已經在發動了、在怒吼了、…但是、曾幾何時、便內戰紛起、外侮疊至——非但外侮疊至、並且還發生了空前未有的國難、此北原因、究何在乎、</p>
<p>我早就說過、『作者常博考各國富强之由、深究吾國禍亂之源、每以爲吾國所以兵連禍結、甚至北伐完成、猶不能永絕禍亂之根、永維和平之局者、其最主要的原因、實由於無統一健全之民意、</p>
<p>人類之通病、每僅注意於表面之粉飾、而忽於澈底之更張、歷來政治之積弊、亦每僅注意於一二英雄豪傑馬上之戰功、而未致力於全國人民力量之培養、</p>
<p>中國革命、其意義之偉大、固非歷來朝代更替所可同語、而北伐之完成、其意義與使命、亦與歷來英雄豪傑之馬上立功、奪取江山者、逈然異趣、所惜者、人民之力量、始終未能與軍事的勝利、並駕而齊驅、及至軍事底定、北伐完成、而人民之力量、猶未堅强、人民之意志、猶未統一、黨內之士、未能於實際上奔走宜傳、鞏固軍事勝利於久遠……』（註二）</p>
<p>我寫這文的時候、尚留學歐洲、絕緣政治、初無恩怨的偏見、今之視昔、亦猶後之視今、我們究將何以努力報國、方不致虛有共表、徒託空言、而不負我們歡欣鼓舞、熱烈慶祝的初衷、此則眞正關懷國運有愛領袖者、所應嚴切考慮、刻實自勉之事也、</p>

<h3>紗花　日廠工潮解決說　紗市收盤時回挫</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、氣勢轉和而現紗銷路平庸、故人心平凡、惟多數心理因各廠現貨根子未見大鬆、對於近期紗拉緊、不願放棄、至收盤時多說紗廠工潮已可解决、市面復挫矣、</p>
<p>機紗漲跌參差</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、市熊梢疲因外棉消息平庸、然本埠日紗廠工潮汹湧、新買者咸具戒心、因此市况平靜、二盤後聞紗銷不暢、二品紗市回挫、稍形下落、標紗結果、各月上日收盤價均跌一·三·六·八角、午後開盤、氣勢稍緊、市價徵現上升、二三盤形勢仍緊、迨至收盤回落、傳說紗廠工潮已告段落、絕無問題、結果各月比上午收盤價微漲一·二·四·五角、查賣出長豐五千六百五十包、長餘一千四百包、明德二千一百五十包、合興一千六百包、仁豐一千八白包、潤康一千五百五十包、昶記一千六百五十包、大昶一千八百五十包、買進大孚一千九百包，賡豐三千四百五十包、愼記一千四百包、大昌成一千四百五十包、協成二千三百五十包、大昶一千六百包、生源一千包、永大一千包、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左</p>

<h3>美棉產額激增　棉花市奇大鬆</h3>
<p>來貨湧旺…價高銷呆　棉市大疲、且跌風劇烈、蓋以美棉第四次估計發表、產額爲一千二百四十萬包、比上决激增七十九萬一千包、幸市價僅跌十餘磅音、故賣勢尚平、然大都以棉產增收、對於棉價看低、心思允切云、</p>
<p>標花價跌半元</p>
<p>標花前市開槃、因美棉第四决估計發表產額爲一千二百四十萬包、比上决增加七十九萬一千包、跌十磅音、於是人心驚虛、賣氣頗熾、近月跌勢兇猛、拍至遠月、尚見和緩、二盤後仍屬平凡、迨至收槃、籌碼稍枯、回上一角、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌二三角半、午後開盤、因空頭抵補稍形回好、二盤後聞來源湧旺、現棉廠胃閉塞、近月跌風復起、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一角半、查賣出長和一萬零七百擔、大豐二千一百擔、通記五千二百擔、裕大二千擔、合興四千五百擔、華懋、千擔、長豐二千四百擔、澗康一萬二千六百擔、源興昌四千七百擔、泰昌三千八百擔、信誠二千四百擔、買進大昶九千一百擔、仁豐二千擔、豐泰五千五百包、大學二千六百擔、恒益六千五百擔、聚與二千擔、大豐二千擔、錦昌六千九百擔、愼昌二一千三百擔、生源四千八百擔、瑞大一千三百擔、茲將一日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現棉廠需停頓</p>
<p>現棉消費停頓、廠胃完全閉塞、日廠方還價甚低、致市上未能成交、來源姚花一千〇八十包、通花九百五十包、</p>
<h3>政府報告發表後　美棉反動一致下降　—政府報告發表後—　——英印棉漲跌互見——</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌一磅音至漲四磅音、晨初市况不定、一度上漲後、同業獲利了結、旋以多頭了結及大批套賣、市價下落、同業及賣戶依然買進、關於期棉趨勢、衆意不一、買方恃布疋暢銷及現棉有力爲主力、政府報告發表後、現棉及布市依然靜而堅穩、據紐的棉花交易所最近消息、巴西棉收的在一百三十八萬包至一百四十八萬包之間、先前估計、在一百六十萬包至一百七十萬包之間去年爲一百五十三萬包、收盤牛穩、計現貨跌十一磅音、期貨跌九至十三磅音、英棉現貨漲一點、期貨跌八至十點、印棉多頭了結、爲出口商買進所抵銷、計平果爾漲一·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲二至二·二五羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（九日電）</p>

<h3>疋頭　粗布實銷漸轉良好　藍布去路殊覺不暢</h3>
<p>昨布市以標紗花雖告微挫、而現紗根子依然奇缺、細紗轉漲兩元、布價本廠印花貨白貨均屬平和、惟東貨細布細斜已連漲四天、昨市已略轉平和、惟以同興麩海諸廠罷工尚未解决、市上現貨軋缺、故細布繼漲每疋五分至一角細斜漲（每疋）一角全一角半、市布八四原布市勢已平定、華商及英商各廠組布現銷漸佳、供求頗能相埒、允以怡和廠出品各檔粗重磅粗布市銷最旺、逐日派出近二百元、尚感不敷需求、昨本街及漢口安慶等帮繼續買進怡和廠粗布百餘包、東貨細布細呢八四布市布二百餘包、長州帮進本廠細斜綫呢嗶嘰色斜一百餘件、漢口帮辦進白貨之外印花絨綫呢白絨藍布印花貨亦辦去二百件、粤帮進十二月份常州各織廠細斜紋二百餘件、閩滇川浙及冀魯陜豫等帮現銷均極淡簿、祇催裝前訂進之貨、藍布現銷轉滯、各地去路不暢、存擱　夥、英商綸昌廠豪俠圖宣布已由十二元一角减售十一元六角云、</p>

<p>粉市初漲繼落、呈危旋之局、以麥報訊、芝加哥坎拿大各小數分至一角餘、但利牧浦漲起一辦士至一辦士又八分之七、故晨間開盤之始、人心曾見微俏、較前日好起半分左右旋以市塲人心、一致看平、大戶方面、微有回出、因之市氣漸平、迨至下午開盤、交易甚清、本月份上落無幾、遠期各月份、則以業外觀望、買氣不振、趨勢平靜異常、照目下情形、將呈互擯、因抬高價格、恐與洋麥接近、至就國內麥價而言、一時似不能過鬆、是以交易頓寂、雙方均難進展云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份大致平靜、因洋麥報價、互有上落、故開價時市氣殊淸、因目下小麥雖已落令、惟市面到此地步、應有局部之過程、漲則難期念進、跌圳與洋麥尚不能接近、所以雙方互擯、交易遂清、迨至下午開盤、本月份因現麥不振、人心頗盧、收價已低至九角、遠期各月份、大致均小三四五分不等、</p>
<h3>糙秈約幫置起暢辦</h3>

<h3>厚新粳到稀行市平定</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到五十餘號、貨共一萬一千四五百石、內中薄稻占大半、本街銷塲平淡、平津靑烟等帮續辦薄稻有五千餘包、惟以逐日剩貨頗多、致售方心思較餒、而客帮吃盤亦苛行情遂跌落二角二分、厚新粳賴貨稀、市呈定局、杜洋尖及陰變元悉無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到頭不多、祇有二十七八號、市上胃口平常、薄稻貨厚銷呆、價跌去角外、變元挺立、新粳次貨價緊扣、高中定局，其餘各米均無上落、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （狩崙）</p>
<p>奮鬥是成功之母——「失敗是成功乏母」的這句話究竟是說不通的，多少人便受着它的愚弄而沒落，這是極可惜的事情。說這句話的原意，原是不可非議的，認爲，失敗以後，當勿灰心，應該要依舊再接再厲的奮鬥，必得成功。但是把兩頭意義相反的話拼湊起來，而把中間最基本的意義倒反而删除去了，這究竟是大錯誤的，所以應得要改爲「奮鬥是成功之母」才對呢？或在前再加上一句話說：「失收勿灰心，常再努力奮鬥」·</p>
<p>記得古代希臘的思想家海拉克來圖曾說過一句思想史上極有名的話道：「爭鬥是萬物之父」，在這裏正可以拿來對照。</p>
<p>生活本是一種戰鬥，每一個人就是人生戰塲上的戰士：沒有奮鬥，便沒有活動，就那能進步，更那裏來成功或勝利。這因爲奮鬥是活動的創始，活動是進步的手段，而有進步才能達到成功或勝利的境地：所以欲求勝利成功，當先不屈不撓的奮鬥起來看。至於失敗便灰心而不再求奮鬥者，奴才而已。</p>
<h3>詩丐</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>「賦性生來是野流，手持竹杖過通州，飯籃向曉迎殘月，歌板臨風唱晚秋；兩脚踏翻塵世路，一肩担盡古今愁，而今不受嗟來食，村犬無須吠不休，」這是昔年在隨園詩話中見到的一首乞丐的詩。這詩道出他作丐的幽閒自得，道出他所以作丐的滿腹牢騷，眞令人不厭諷誦。至於這首詩，是在那乞丐死了之後，在他身畔發現的；於是有人給他葬了，並樹了一塊題着「通州詩丐之墓」的石碑，算是盡了一點愛才之意。而這一位詩丐，不願在他生前炫耀他的詩才，仗了他詩才過那優裕的生活，却寗可懷了他佳作，作那乞食生涯，這種胸襟，多麽値得欽敬，也惟具此胸襟，才堪稱是一位眞正的詩人。</p>
<p>明社旣屋，不但有很多的士大夫階級從容殉國，慷慨成仁，便是賤如乞丐，亦有不忍社稷的淪亡，甘爲祖國犧牲生命者。「三百年來養士朝，如何文武盡皆逃？綱常留在卑田院，乞丐羞存命一條。這首詩，便是在南都陷落後，一位投秦淮河自盡的乞丐，留題在百川橋上的絕命詩。像這一位詩丐，莫說是眼前一般甘作異族順民的要望塵莫及，便是一些負有官守職責的大人先生們，對之也應感到相當的慚恧呢。</p>
<p>據一位前輩說：上海在光緒年間，曾有一位女詩丐在街頭發表伊的佳作後，曾轟動過一時，一般入更都解囊樂助，所以給伊很弄到一筆錢。伊的詩是：「自嘆今生命不齊，十年漂泊望江西：此來悔托沿門缽，滬水凄凉得句題。」有那麼淸麗的詩句，自然會動人憐才之念。而這女詩丐能想出借詩歛錢的妙法，也可見伊的聰明了。</p>
<p>上海，畢竟是人文蒼萃之地，近年來給我見到的男女詩丐，也很不鮮。像「書劍飄零無地存，年年托缽日沿門：勸君更進王孫食，結草含環報大恩。」便是我最近在水門汀上見到的，其他不能盡憶了。不過這類詩人的表顯他的詩才，目的無非在阿堵物上，是不能與隨園詩話中的詩丐與明末的殉國時丐同日而語的；可見古今詩丐的相去，也已很遠了。</p>
<h3>聽打稻聲</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>今歲秋天的氣候。眞可說是再好沒有了；兩月來日目陽光朗照，滴雨不下，所以各鄉的農作物，都是豐收，像棍花每畝平均計算，差不多要捉到滿擔，而且花價也異常昂貴，比較以前幾年，因爲收接不好，成羣結隊的到城裏來鬧荒，眞有天淵之別了；所以眼前農村中，大有復興的氣象，就照吾們嘉定來講，本是「棉七稻三」，而稻田不過佔到十份之三，且東北各鄉，還是棉田佔得多，種稻的祗有西鄉，那末：像只些的水田，原算不得什麼？然而天時無風無雨，一直到今，棉花固然是好，連得黃花也不會有，（黃花，因陰雨連綿，霉腐而成，）捉到手裏，可說朵朶値錢，不曉得種稻的，年年要蝕本，（因荳餅工價日貴，加以災荒，種稻無有不蝕本者，）今歲還可以拉過，大家已喜出望外，說是，這是靠天公約賜予我小民，不致餓死啊！</p>
<p>你！現在倘然到鄉間去瞧，哼！隴畝問以前靑靑的稻葉，都變了像滿目黃雲一樣，隨風飄著，而穀穗呢，都俯在下面，似乎承不起來，就可見到天高氣爽，那米粒十分長足，沒有一顆是本殼，俗語說得好，呌「寒露無靑稻，霜降一齊倒，」眼前重陽也過了，不要說滿城風雨，偏是秋光格外來得皎潔，鄉入乘這好天氣，就把田裏的稻斫下，一擔一擔的挑到宅門前，在木架上，男男女女，擎着稻打穀，堆得滿地、聽到這種聲饗，拍撻！拍撻！不由得使人知道，是村莊裏的好景象，吾曾經問過一個鄉下的老人家，今年穀粒可收多少？他現着笑容，說：多也沒有，好些，總要收一石五斗多，不好些，也有一石光景，已是近幾年來，未曾有過的豐年了：吾輩種田的人，總是靠天吃飯，如其風風雨雨，天公不肯做美，那裏有這種好收成呢？說罷，他眞十分得意，可見別處地方的早稻，都是豐登，吾們嘉定小小的濱海地土，尤其是晚稻，方才　獲，然而我也要代他記了一篇，作爲慶祝的文字</p>
<h3>拆信封</h3>
<p>— 承明</p>
<p>上海地方各界人士的拆信封，大的也有三種拆法，而且帶有一些滑稽而近於迷信的花頭經，分爲「升高」「橫財」「脫底」三種拆法，茲將這三種拆信封方式，紀錄於後。</p>
<p>大多數入家拆信，在信封的上端拆開，謂之「升高」大槪官吏與商家，都以升高發財爲目標，所以他們拆信，總在信封的上端一剪刀將信封裏面的信箋，用二指伸進去請它升高上去，然後捧在手裏，細讀端詳了。</p>
<p>也有一般商界中人的拆信，在信封的橫頭開拆的，呌做「橫財」，什麼呌做「橫財」呢？就是「橫裁」的譯音，他們除升高之外，還想發財，所以他們拆起信封來，大都在信封的側面，用唾涎水將舌尖一舐，舐得信封的邊上濕透，用手撕開，謂橫財，亦稱橫裁，用其簡便而不用剪刀也，惟像這樣的拆信方式，似太嫌不雅觀了。</p>
<p>尚有一般粗心的人們，將信的下端拆開，謂之「脫底」，將信封內的信箋，直拖而下，旣不雅觀，又不便利，又有一般視爲不利舉動，此種拆法，智者不爲也。　以上三種拆信手法，以所謂「升高一者最爲大方，至於取口彩而視爲吉凶之兆，則近於滑稽而涉及迷信了。</p>

<h3>湖上雜記</h3>
<p>— （陳小翠）</p>
<p>抱龍古木戰風竊，曾有人呼大樹王，一種秋山如解女，高寒丰格罷濃妝。（題天目　影）</p>
<p>我馬玄黃君肥，白年巾幅羈才稀，碧雲萬里飛鴻雁，問詢齊州女布衣。</p>
<p>雲氣驪山山欲行，六橋惟有雨絲聲，黃昏不許傳紅燭，怕引飛虫入畫屛。　　少保祠堂雲氣高，千年古柏不生苗，此心已化精忠石，雨打風吹不動搖。（岳廟精忠柏已化爲石今貯石室中）</p>
<h3>所謂「南京蟲」之來由</h3>
<p>— （郭振方）</p>
<p>頻羅君曾在本刋談「南京蟲在上海，」按南京蟲是日本的名詞，他們用意是在侮辱整個中國，不過拿南京來代表而已。</p>
<p>他們稱臭蟲爲南京蟲，據說麩：他們那裏本無此物，乃是由張之洞帶去的。張當時爲兩江總督，駐南京。按他們習慣，向以南京代表中國。所以稱中國米爲「南京米，」花生爲「南京豆，」家兎爲「南京兎」等。南京蟲者，意思就是中國蟲也。</p>
<p>實則，臭蟲這東西，乃近代交通都市的產物。豈止上海，南京？豈止中國，日本？巴黎，紐約，倫敦，都有它們的足跡，莫斯科簡直同上海是魯衛之政。「外國也有臭蟲，」這便是，周作人等，常川來反對本位文化者的一句極挖苦的話。</p>
<h3>楓葉</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>是一個秋天的早晨，我悄悄地站在窗前，玩弄着那張紅了的楓葉，像讀着家書一樣，一種離愁，和一秤悲愴，已從我那心底深處爬了起來。</p>
<p>一陣帶着點季節味的秋風，從那敞着的晨衣襟裏鑽了進去，使我心裏湧起了「一年容易又秋風」的感覺。我默默地倚着窗櫺，彷彿準備去參加一個凄凉的葬禮一樣；心裏貯滿了人生的哀愁。自己只想哭，但不能，我應該愛惜自己的眼淚！</p>
<p>從前，我也歡喜秋天，並且常常會跑到秋之原野去躑躅；在秋天裏，我曾經和那些童年的伴侶到海灘上去拾貝壳，我也會在公園中看着那踽踽獨行的哀愁的少婦，夢一般的在秋林里飄過。可是如今，自己連這一點心情都給「中年」的悲哀埋葬了。現在，自己已經是一個飽經風霜的憂患餘生了。</p>
<p>還記得在十二年以前的一個秋天，我正被一位親戚帶着離開了可愛的故鄉，離開了溫暖的家、走進了這人地生疎的大都會，來開始生活的體騐，生的掙扎；在自已那顆童稚的心靈上，抹上了一層灰嗜，然而這層灰暗，只隨着歲月的增加而加厚，永遠無法將它剝下。</p>
<p>「菲，你一路順風的去吧，不過在外而不比是自己的家裏，一劫都要特別小心，師長們的話總要聽？……」船將要離開碼頭時，時，母親站在塘岸上又把那可嚆了千百遍的話對我說着，但是說到後面的幾句，巳經嗚咽不能成普了。</p>
<p>我低着頭，只看著船舷邊的濁水向後流去，自己已如一個待决的囚犯，祇等着前途的命運的容判，並未計及此去，自己的將來是幸福還是痛苦。</p>
<p>沒有憧憬，沒有回溯，祇是默默地讓那隻航船載着我走。自己像一頭可憐的小羔羊，不會掙扎，也不會反抗，我一任他們把我擺佈着，甚至，將我送進了一隻大洪爐裏。</p>
<p>回頭望望那在漸漸地離遠的故鄉，隱的地還能够看到那條伸出在湖梢中的浜渚，並且，我更淸楚地看見母親和安姊還痴立在浜渚梢上，好像是兩尊聖母的石膏像。</p>
<p>我想喊，但是喊不應了，我想哭，然而看着這許多人，却又不敢哭出來，終於，我是抑止住了一泓不爲人知的淸淚，茫茫然的踏上了遙遠前程。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金約指紅豆報相思</p>
<p>夢蘭笑道：滾下去罷，這又有你多嘴的機會了。小菊兒笑着去了，夢蘭自取了兩隻御瓷細彩的杯子出來，先斟了一杯菊花茶送到他面前，然後將碟子裏的松子糖，和淸油綠豆糕，也拿了些送到他面前笑道：這是蘇州帶來的吃一點罷。你也用心良苦，這不算酬勞，不過聊表寸心而已。友梅笑道我什麼事用心良苦，我倒有些不明白。夢蘭道：你今天上午來，打扮得花蝴蝶子似的，那爲的是你好借題發揮。今天晚上來，你讓老媽子送着，也是位了要借題發揮。交朋友，交到你這種仁，眞是讓人由心裏感激出來。友梅端起茶杯來，慢慢的呷着，眼睛注視到夢蘭的臉上。夢蘭也是低頭喝茶，脈脈若有所思。這時，外面又下起雨來。那雨點打在樓下樹葉上，發出一種梭梭之聲。屋檐下也是可噹作響。窗子外天色如淒，看不到一些什麽。只有陣陣的凉氣，由雨林裏送到樓上來。他不作學，友梅也不作聲。在兩個人很沉寂的當兒，覺得這夜雨小樓，令人有說不出的一種剛想。這盞白罩子燈，仿佛也有點陰　的帶了些靑灰的光色。在白天看夢蘭的顏色，也不怎麼消瘦。唯有再這晚間　燈光逼近了他的臉照着那就看到他兩肩深鎖，眼光下垂，臉上紅暈减退，透着有幾分憔悴。友梅道：你已經考慮一天樂。現在你實說，是不是需要我帮忙呢！夢蘭道：當然，是需要的。他說着話，表示了很堅定。所以向桌上放茶杯的時候，同時也點了兩點頭。友梅道：我們相對枯坐，已經有這樣久了，爲什麽你還是不作聲。夢蘭在碟子拿起一塊松子糖在嘴裏咀嚼淸。似乎是想說什麽，可是對友梅微微的笑着，又把頭低下去。在這樣低頭的時間，臉上泛出一層紅暈，才算他的頗色好看些。友梅道：我很知道你的心事，準是怕把話對我說了，我會隨便的告訴別人。其實我們自小在一處，什麽話不說。我的私事你知道的也很多，爲什麽我就不怕你對人說呢？夢蘭也不否認他這句話，也不承認他這句話，只把頭來拖了兩搖，臉上還是帶了很濃厚的笑容。（九六）</p>

<h3>節節推進之淋病治療</h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>……淋疾之經過與病變及內服製劑療法並外部洗滌療法　……睪丸腫脹為淋菌侵触睪丸机能之故喪失生育的可能　……丈夫一方患淋則妻子同時有傳染的危險用何法避免</p>
<p>淋病是一種極為普遍的疾患，而它的傳染，更是非常的快速，所以患本病的人也就特別多，據醫學界的推究，淋病普遍的原因，乃是由於生殖部分之直接傳染，如夫婦不和睦，丈夫宿娼嫖妓，或是青年在春機發動的時期，受劣友引誘而涉足娼寮，都是促成淋病猖獗的原因。但據社會學家的意見，那未乃是由於世界文明，生活程度日高，人民沒有娶妻的能力。</p>
<p>生淋病的人，在沒有治愈前使結婚或和妻子同床起來，對方便要無辜受累，可憐許多清白的婦女，遇人不淑毒所害，致患着纏綿的白帶，失去生育的能力。翁姑琮要代兒子納妾，那真太悲慘了，而男子腎囊腫大也是不能生育的原因，但普通却歸咎於妻室，豈非冤枉。由此看來，男子無論有沒有結婚，必須速加根本治療，才可無慮。</p>
<p>但治療淋病，不是隨便可以收效的。自從蛋白體療法一躍而登淋病治療界的首席。因了蛋白體療法參用了黃色素仿冒效尤的什麼合製淋劑。便鬼鬼崇崇的出現於市場了。但特效藥其實只有一種，而淋病除了蛋白體有昂盛人體白血球的機能，以撲滅淋菌之外，別無第二條途徑。此層淋濁患者可自問醫師及檢閱淋病專書，自然知道我的話確有根據。這種蛋白體黃色素合製劑就是「克淋儂」。此藥對婦女白帶又有確切的治效。凡婦女受丈夫淋毒傳染，白带淋瀝不清，宜內服「克淋儂」清除淋毒，並同時外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」每晚塞入陰道內一二片，以滌白帶，卽可全部治愈。照常生育！</p>
<p>「克淋儂」的特效，對於男性攝護腺炎睪丸炎及關節炎均具舊騐。惟內服此藥後，並須同時外治所謂雙管齊下，則見效尤為迅速。故除一方服「克淋儂」清除血內之淋毒，一方宜外用最有效之「抗淋水」洗滌尿道，則晨起膿濁封口，精血混淆，一經洗滌，即可膿濁消除，放尿暢利。</p>
<p>淋病至今日，內治外治，均有可靠方法，亦快事也！</p>
<h3>伐性的利斧　不愉快的夫妻</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>……愁雲慘霧籠罩下的家庭。　……十九都是男性所造。</p>
<p>人生的幸福，無過於兩性愛情的濃厚，但許多青年的夫婦，外表上看去，似乎沒有什麼不滿意的地方。其實他們僅有不可告人的隱病。據我們在臨床上的統計，這類夫婦實際上過的都是慘痛的生活，而其過失大多是屬於男性的。考其原因由於男性，在春機發育期，被惡劣的友輩嬉弄，或誤讀淫書艷書，釀成了手淫的惡癖。這種惡癖，能把性的機能異常，最顯著的就是腎臟內側體腔的上皮細胞分化作用，不能正常的發展。性腺的組織，也失去健全的形態。性腺的輸出管，沒有執行分泌的能力。於是性器的發育，自然要受嚴重的障礙了。而連帶異生育上有很大關係的，就是攝護腺。此腺液負有涵養精子的責任，往往也因了手淫而把攝護腺損傷，不能泌出腺液。所以縱使有了精蟲，也因沒有腺液去涵養牠而涸斃，而成為男性不姙。此等症狀，皆為手淫引起之惡果。更因荷爾蒙之損失，中樞神經缺少此種刺戟，性慾消失，勃起力不能。遺精，早洩，精液稀薄，精蟲缺如。他如頭痛失眠，健忘心悸等。皆紛然並作，手淫真是伐性的利斧啊！</p>
<p>這種治療，據我從俄國勞働大學畢業後所經騐的療法而言，以服「補體康」一藥，功效最著。因為此劑是勇壯動物所製成，服後借血液的循環，輸送各部，旺盛荷爾蒙的產生，所以中樞神經也獲得刺戟，性感恢復，性器官也獲得充分的發育。於是兩性的愛情也因性的織織健全而恢復了。把家庭愁慘的雲務，也換了愉快的空氣。那時自然知人生愛性的真蹄，甜蜜的家庭快樂了。「補體康」實是兩性的福音，宣乎各國醫家一致採用。可是有遺精病人，可兼服「耐而斯遺精片」那麼對於患者，更得充分的治愈。</p>
<h3>十分慘痛之急性淋</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>患者周吉雲君。年廿一歲。前月因偕友赴某酒樓應宴。於醉意朦朧之中，折入平康，豈知春風一度，孽根遂種。蓋周君已染上淋疾矣。因惑於庸醫之說，誤服劣藥，前後治療二星期，不想病態加重，龜頭炎腫，包皮腫大，泌出濃液甚多，而意頻數，每次小便，痛不可忍。日夜呼號，經由林子兵君介紹余處，乃取患者泌出之膿液，以顯徵鏡檢查之，其淋菌甚多，密如髪　（見第一圖）乃遂滌清共尿道外，方囑進服「克淋儂」，以消炎鎮痛，利尿殺菌，治療二星期，腫痛已完全治愈。惟小便尚有淋絲，更囑服「克淋儂」至一星期，再行顯徵鏡檢查已無淋絲踪跡。惟為偵查其是否治，乃抽騐血液，　仍無淋毒反應，為純然之血液（見第二圖）至此始證明根治云。</p>

<p>如何解決再發性之淋病</p>
<p>再發性淋病，在老淋病而未獲正確根治之患者，甚為多見。蓋患者每因急性淋症狀之減退，遂玩忽懈治，一任毒勢延深部，凡有組織鬆弛之處，淋菌皆得藏匿其地繁殖徒衆，而生種種不測這變症。每因一種症象之出現，始請醫治療。迨症象一去，仍不措意，如遇飲酒行動房事等重大刺戟時，卽突然再發。患者恒覺身體疲勞，精神異常，排尿困難，艱　作痛，往往牽引到肛門會陰等處。引等淋病，蔓延之範圍極廣，故醫治之方，亦須前後左右面面顧到。依此治療法則，始能收根治之效，而此種醫治之法，以內服「克淋儂」，使患者服後於短期中發生抗淋毒素，將藏器體內深奧場所這淋菌，包圍而湌殺之。俾無漏網。余更輔以長短波電療法及血清與X線等療法，、奏效更速。</p>
<p>對於此種再發性之又須注意者，必事預防傳染異性。因此等淋病，患者恐疎忽於長時期之禁慾與防範也有東熙華德路之李致佶君，昔患淋病，嗣因忽於醫治；而症狀又不十分凶惡，但偶逢勞倦與房事，則厥疾必事重發。且已傳染其夫人。嗣由大東書局購得拙著「性病全書」，乃來我處治療，乃先行手術及電療外，更囑內服「克淋儂」以消炎殺菌鎮痛，四星期後，小便通暢，消潔異常，舉凡肛門會陰脹痛等症，均迅獲根治。其夫人之白帶，亦經余指用內服「克淋儂」，外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除白帶，亦計三四星期獲痊。（其夫人之病係在家依法自療者）李君夫婦，均經血清檢查，毫無反應。偕　迄今，並經種種大刺戟，亦無病態變化。足證根治矣。</p>
<h3>因白帶而來之膣道病</h3>
<p>— 陳少華</p>
<p>婦女膣道，以其終年浸潤，又時以房事生產之磨折，故病患較任何部份為多。白帶病卽其一也。患者陰膜發炎糜爛，頻有惡液流出。呈乳白色，是曰白帶，但如有侵害微血管部分，則往入雜有血絲，或血滴，俗稱赤帶，其實該項疾患，由於白帶時失洽而來。且多引起月經困難，而招不孕之惡果，固不僅有損夫體健，消蝕美容已也。</p>
<p>「卡而雪地氏陰道片」一藥，為掃滌白帶之聖藥，功能鎮痛消為止泌防腐，在三四星期中卽可奏效。惟因淋病而來者可兼服「克淋儂」因白帶而致月經病者，可兼服「補女容」則所患可同時治愈矣。此等療法之微妙，在於家中自療，可不勞醫生家之門。凡每應用「卡而雪地陰道片」者，可每日於臨睡前以一片插入陰道，次晨洗去即得，絕對無刺戟性。故為一般女子有白帶病者所樂用也。</p>
<h3>肺病療養法</h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>……肺病為一慢性的病患療法須適合經濟　……雖無特效藥但用溫文有效之藥亦能愈　……患者皆體力衰弱故旺聲體力實有良功</p>
<p>丟開一切成見，實事求是的來說說肺病療養法，這對於患有肺病的人，也許會得着切身的益處罷</p>
<p>如大家所知道的一般，肺病到今天還沒有特效方法，那些外科手術，理學的療法，都不過是比較的有特效方法，那些製劑也只能增加患者的抵抗力，幫助撲滅癆菌，這是現在各國醫師所一致公認的。所以肺病對於內服藥，也實在迫切需要。</p>
<p>倘使說肺病只有用外科手術（抽肋骨，打空氣針）可以治好，那末療養院中的病人，醫生為什麼一定要結他吃止咳和化痰的藥，或是內服及注射止血藥劑？假使療養院對於肺病人完全不採用內服藥，則肺病內服藥可以根本廢除，否則仍舊應當繼續加以研究，以求更有效的內服補肺特效藥發現。</p>
<p>肺病是一個慢性病，療法必須合於經濟，如果處置適當，則在自宅療養也可治愈。據近頃發明的「補肺拿爾」，就是療養肺病時一個有力的內服劑。本劑可旺盛體力，增進抵抗，故服後卽見欬痰稀鬆，胸痛輕快，咯血停止，實為最合理想的製劑。</p>
<h3>婦女病療治之新途徑</h3>
<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>……廢除單純之補血治療法　……增加荷爾蒙法最屬超特</p>
<p>女姓的神經衰弱，月經不調，久婚不姙，都是女性病中最多見的症狀。此等症狀，通常都稱牠為婦女病。其實我們治病，應該從根本上去研究，才能得到一個徹底的療法。因女子的病的根源，不外卵巢子宮等生殖上最生要的器官，所以我們要徹底解決女子的病患，先要把這等重要器官調整。然後才可獲得健康的體力，美健等的目的。</p>
<p>據我自在陸軍醫科大學畢業後的臨床經騐，調整卵巢，亢進新陳代謝機能，將病態徹底矯正；同時對於月經困難，旣獲通順，受孕力增加，而神經衰弱，如頭痛失眼，心悸亢進，心神抑　，眼花耳鳴等症，均可獲愈。且因為增加新陳代謝的機能，所以婦女貧血，萎黃病，都有可一雪而除。使皮膚變換，細膩白晳，兩頰豐腴，挽轉已消失的青春，這等功效。並不是我個人治騐有效，就是歐美婦女界，也知道「補女容」是治療婦女月經不調，神經衰弱，早衰等丙的根治的內服藥。惟有白帶病者，可兼外有「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌帶防腐，收效尤速。</p>
<h3>幸福的夫婦性生活之獲得</h3>
<p>……如何可以糾正夫婦間的障碍　留日陳敏伯醫師　……美滿的家庭歡樂之正當尋求</p>
<p>男女的恩愛，從生理與心理方面來觀察，可以說是完全建築在性愛上面的。變愛到了最後的階段，便進到肉體。夫婦當兩情繾綣的時候，那如膠似漆的狀態正是由性愛表現出來的。如果丈夫失去雄厚的男性天賦機能，那末做妻子的只是像投身到尼庵一樣，徒然消磨有限的青春，結果，不幸的事實使將演出，而離婚，拌嘴，私奔等等，便都一幕幕扮演了。</p>
<p>所以，新時代的夫婦，應該怎樣保持住美滿的性生活，乃是必不可缺少的要務。但是，有些萎弱的丈夫，為了討好妻子竟挺而走險去購服壯陽一類春藥，其流弊非至夭促壽命不止。</p>
<p>負有保障人民健康責任的醫師，應該急速取締那些春藥，而從事挽救一些性機能萎弱的患者。因為患者由於房事過度，或是在發育期冒犯手淫，耗喪了荷爾蒙，以致有遺精。精滑，腎萎早洩，勃起力不壯等症，所以應當速以荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」旺盛全身的荷爾蒙，壯健神經，如是可以恢復健全的腎部機能，而獲得幸福的性生活。至於遺精的症候，可同時並服「耐而斯遺精片」，那末遺精卽可根本治愈了！</p>

<h3>最安全的補體戒煙法</h3>
<p>— 楊道南醫師</p>
<p>吸上鴉片煙癮的人，為什麼多數都喜歡戒後又吸，或是思戒而未能？考求它的原因，則有二端：</p>
<p>（一）鴉片煙毒，能催毀人體全身荷爾蒙，使細胞機能萎縮，以致肌肉瘦削，精神不振。凡事畏綻。</p>
<p>（二）沒有適當旺盛荷爾蒙的藥劑。或專以培補性腺為號召，不切實際，故戒時痛苦重重。</p>
<p>所以最有效的戒煙法，只有補體法旺盛全身荷爾蒙，那木細胞和神經皆健全，戒時毫無痛苦。據此，荷爾蒙劑「補體康」實是戒煙最好的藥物了</p>

<h3>瑪德里失陷</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社七日倫敦念電：「據官方消息，西班牙國民政府，已自瑪德里遷往東海岸伐朗西亞城……」遷都德後怎樣呢？據云：「將繼續與國民軍作戰云。」這樣說來，瑪德里卽使失陷，也不能說西班牙的內戰」是告終了，相反，西班牙的內戰自瑪德里的失陷，將更進到一個新的階段。</p>
<p>西班牙自左派人民陣線獲勝以後，左右兩翼的明爭暗鬬，更趨于尖銳化，而時常發生流血的慘劇。本年四月十七日阿柴那政府公佈解散法西斯蒂團體的命令，對右傾組織加以重重的壓迫。因此迫使右翼團體，乞憐于大查本家，企圖以武力推翻左派政府，以阻撓政府解决工潮的訐制的實現。這種陰謀後來爲政府所發覺，於是乃大舉搜捕右傾分子一千餘人。而其時保王黨黨魁索台洛又突于四月十三日被人暗殺，這更引起了法西斯黨及保王黨普遍的反感，卒于十八日在西班牙保護地摩洛哥醞釀叛變，有名的西班牙內戰於是啟幕，而直至本月七日西班牙遷都止，入民生命財產的損失正是不計其數，同時　在這塲戰爭當中，更顯露出國際和平者和侵略者的面目來。</p>
<p>與其說是西班牙的內戰」·母寗說是二决世界大戰的縮影，在這內戰中，我們通過所謂「不干涉協定」，更可以看出德國，意大利，葡萄牙，的接濟叛軍，以及英國態度的壺昧不明。總之表現在這內戰中，世界的和平陣線和侵略陣線的堅壁淸野，是顯然可以看得出的。</p>
<p>據電訊云，這次「內戰」的結果，死亡人數達十七萬五千人，當然，到現在怕已有了二十萬左右了吧。這死亡的數字是相當驚人的，然而西班牙人民大衆的英勇的抗拒惡勢力，是有其鉅大的價値的。第一，是使全世界的人民大衆認淸了侵略者的獰猙的面目；第二，和平的影響在世界各國凡是愛好和平的民衆，從這决西班牙內戰爭中所見到的，可以說是戚受非常深刻的。</p>
<p>至于我們中國民衆，正在受强大敵人侵略的時候，常然對于侵略者的表示是萬分痛惡的，同時，也可以從這西班牙的內戰中，找到我們的一敵乎？友乎？」的聯盟者。</p>
<h3>聰明的觀眾</h3>
<p>— 凡甲</p>
<p>有一個時候我很喜歡觀看上海流行着的所謂「述台新戲」。那種新戲有漂亮的佈景，驚人的機關，情節又曲折離奇，而在每本戲的終塲總是給觀衆一個悶葫蘆，譬如那「大人」能否化險爲夷？「公子小姐一的含寃能否水落石出？那個惡霸」爲什麽沒有服法？但是下一本新戲裏還是沒有交代，而且「案子」接一連二的發生，害得做「大人」的到枯廟中去「祈夢」。於是觀衆的心始終被緊緊地拉住着，戲館的生意好得要幾天之前去定座。</p>
<p>但是看得多了，被我發現了一個大關鍵，就是每一本新戲中都是那個惡霸在那裏搗鬼，他誣良爲盜，强搶民女，無所不作，無所不爲，「好人」就到處遭殃，做「大人」的手下雖然有許多能人俠客，還是常常急得要命。</p>
<p>懂得了這關鍵，我就不再看連台新戲了，化了許多寃錢去博編劇人的一聲哈哈，那似乎太儍了。</p>
<p>最近却又看了幾本「連台新戲」，原因倒並不是願意做「儍子」，我是想去看看那個演「惡霸」的演員的。這許多時候的闊別，佈景機關等已大有進步，並發明一種呌做Dark　Change、的搶景法。譬如明明是一幕「洞房花燭夜」的好戲，在幾秒鐘的黑暗塲面中變成了强盜山上的「大演習」。諸如此類，都是令觀衆「悲喜交集」！而演員們的演技却還是墨守陳法，這就是我又去看「連台新戲」的原因了。我是很愛好那個演「惡霸」的演員的，這當然是我的偏見。因爲他一出塲，先有着一張抹白粉的花臉告訴觀衆他不是個「善類」，舉動，說白又是那樣地惡劣，令入生氣。有一個笑話不是說一個樵子看「曹操逼宮」，看得「心頭火起」，奔上台去把演曹操的演員斫了？後世人都以爲那演員太賣力演得過分逼眞，我就木同意這個說法，實在是那個樵子太「欠缺修養」，有誰見過一個「惡霸」抹着白粉臉，而「窮兇極惡」地明白表現他自己的「身份」的？「演得過分逼眞」，我看了祗覺好笑，於是我徧見的愛好演「惡霸」的演員。</p>
<p>不過，奔上台去也罷，祗覺好笑也罷，述演戲人在內沒有一個不是「傻子」這是明明白白的事實。如果有一天演「惡霸」的演員扮了個白面書生，搖着紙扇，踱着方步，假斯文起來「揖讓爲禮」，那時候樵子才是個聰明的觀衆。</p>
<h3>陡門線上</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>——海宴之什——</p>
<p>天還沒有亮透，老鶴就來敲門，這天我們要橫渡過南海的灣面到山國似的陡門，路程有三十華里，所以要早一點兒跑路，兩個人冒着淡淡的朝露向西南出發了。早晨的山野是那麼可愛的，從大海面飄過來的海風，一陣一陣地撲進我們的心胸裏，我愛鄉村，鄉村的新鮮的空氣可以療養我那悒鬱的心情，那時一路所見的魚翁樵婦。負着鋤頭的農夫，跟遼遠的山和水，構成了一幅大自然的美麗的畫圖。這些，已使我感到無限的快慰了，是的，在上海，在其他的城市，那兒可以呼吸到這好的空氣呢？</p>
<p>過了汶村，從汶村到橫山還有十多華里的路程，可是，在這兒就感到一片曠荒了的田野底凄凉，這一帶都是靠着海邊的農田，在往年的深秋時節，總可以看到無涯似的展開去的禾田，綠茸茸的稻草和開了花的穗牠們數不淸而望不盡地在溫柔的海風中盪漾，那輕盈而嬝娜的風悄會想到農民們的愉快。可是，今年中秋前的洪水的災害，把千千萬萬片的綠禾吞掉了，沒有一點兒存留，沒有一點兒値得留戀的景色，只有使人無限地感傷的赤色的田塲被無情的白雲廣漠地罩籠着。</p>
<p>地帶比較高的田塲雖還有稻禾生長着。但捱不起那炎烈的太陽，乾得田面開裂了，看樣子就可憐，沒有一點兒可以收穫的。一路看去，還可以看出當時被災死的人底血痕，據老鶴說，這一帶還不算什麽，茭　一帶死者千三百餘，一百多小村莊倒塌者十分之九，那兒不但沒有了禾，而且田塲上到處地留着濃厚的血跡，雖然災後已經有兩個月了，死屍也收殮了，可是，血底腥臭還在海</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>風上恒久地飄盪，沒有人跡的茭　鄕村的情形，比這兒的慘處何止百倍呢。—這，使我的心兒也忐忑地跳了起來，就在沿途一帶的鄕村，也可以看到當時被水衝塌了的房屋，每一條村莊都有十分之一以上的損失，而田野上也可以看到死者底留痕，那茭　鄕村，一定已　成鬼的國土了。我想，明天，從陡門回來，我就實地為「水災」的題材去親察一次，那兒一定會有值得痛　，但也滿足的收　的。</p>
<p>到了橫山，橫山是在南海的　　，這山前臨大海，其他沒有連接的山脈，風景奇麗，高高的山峯滿是綠叢叢的樹林，鄕人名之曰　猪　山」但是，如果依風水來說，這山峯隔海的對面是獅子山和虎山，所以橫山從來不見盛旺的，以前有一個文人遊此，題曰「橫逆無比，山獨有餘」這是很出名的一個地方了。</p>
<p>到了海濱，我們就呌了小船，化了六角白銀的代價，張起了風帆，在平靜的海面迎風輕輕兒的飄過去，這兒可以望見那海面的白茫茫無涯的一片，當年陸秀夫負帝　沉海而滅的崖山和崖門，就在這兒出海的不遠，這兒常常有很大的風浪，所以航海者都很驚心的。這一帶地方，是宋末的帝王遷居的地方，所以趙姓的人們大都還以這點歷史來作談話的資料，也是我到海宴來的一個特色的收穫呢。</p>
<p>到了陡門，往年多賊的時候，這一帶都做了巨賊的大本營，因為，這兒是交通不便，大山脈遠遠地接連着。再過三四十華里的崎嶇山路，就是窮鄕的陽江縣境，人們是那麽野蠻的，在這些人們的風情上，我可以看出從未看過的粗俗的特性來。</p>
<p>還沒有到陡門以前，對於偏鄕的人情風俗，還沒深刻的印象，現在使我深深地刻上了暗裏害怕的濃厚的封建氣息——這特色的海濱的山國呵。</p>
<h3>或人書柬</h3>
<p>— 或人</p>
<p>窓外正下着秋雨，我睡不着，於是想起了你，想寫幾句話來告訴你我的近况。</p>
<p>這一星期來我每晚失眠，總得天亮了纔能合上眼，原因嗎？我自己也說不出。</p>
<p>是因為孤寂的緣故嗎？從前我是這樣想過的，現在可感不到了，一個人孤寂慣了，是反會感到孤寂可親的，讓一個人關在一間小房間裏翻翻書報，抽抽烟的度過一個漫漫的長夜，這况味有時是會比在燈紅酒綠的熱鬧塲所來得有味的。</p>
<p>我自然是也不甘孤寂過的，但燈紅酒綠的塲所多的是抱着孤寂之感的人；在午夜回家，見到那孤另另的明月，牠也會使我更難受，還不如獃在家裏翻翻書報來得好，因之，我雖然時常因為太衝動而去找刺激，然而找刺激的結果，所得的却是更深的苦痛而不是麻醉。因之我時常後悔，但又偏時常把後悔的苦果給自己嘗。</p>
<p>今天，我是又嘗了後悔的苦果回來。</p>
<p>現在，那個賣唱的婦人又來了，她是有着沙啞的嗓子的，但是她却儘可能地把它逼尖，所以，她的唱簡直不是唱而是嘶呌了，而嘶呌得又是那麽努力。</p>
<p>朋友，我擱筆了，我想靜靜地聽一下那們天涯淪落人的嘶呌，在她的嘶呌中，我要找出她憤怒的程度來。</p>
<p>或許，這是我變態的癖好吧？是的，這也許是我的變態的癖好，因為牠能打動我的心絃，我覺得她的歌是最動聽的。但也許，我從她的歌聲裏，能够領略些，我此後應該怎樣去做個人。</p>
<p>想說的話太多，但却說不出來。我們再會吧。</p>

<p>怡紅公子與蘋卿。兩小無猜各有情。彼此相親相近久。欲成眷屬慰生平。那知變化從中起。那有，李　桃　計劃精。暗　蘅無君作配。相和，怡紅公子作　驚鳴。一朝交拜完花燭。　使怡紅心內驚。　不肯忘情林黛玉。可惜。被人播弄未能成。不　與薛氏和琴瑟。欲親往瀟湘館一行。他見　紫鵑時。盤問根出　後事。方知妃子已命犧牲。他頓時態度和前異。似醉如瘋不欲生。從此心知情是幻。將紅塵看破一身輕。飄然遠去無消息。不複雪家衣錦榮。如神龍藏尾寂無聲。</p>

<p>開篇「哭花」　（咪咪集創刊號）</p>
<p>形瘦骨立步遲遲。只為梨花心自痴。梨花是，報春有心芽長茁。如今儂，畏寒無意寫新詞。翹望開山雲疊疊。推看窗外雨絲絲。細雨潤花花似醉。微風梳柳柳如絲。梨花呀，冰玉肌膚堪足比。潔身自好永堅持。你因是，容顏秪剩三分白。莫不是，因儂吟詠買花詞。梨花呀，一顰一笑怎無話。想必是，半　漸羞半為痴。今朝休被東風落。何事東風頻鞭笞。梨花呀，鳥因惜羽迎風啄。你因甚，瓣被風吹映墨池。雁足難逢。莫寄。墨池瓣影。想思。梨花呀，憔悴容顏　見惜。　儂惜　　於斯。掃瓣拾納　　裏。憐　寸心　　　。哭花至此淚　　。　　有情果知之。沒奈何，閉窗靜聽風竹掃闌　。</p>

<h3>賽金花的身世（續）</h3>
<p>因爲德國欽差克林德被義和拳捉來殺了，引起八國軍進攻北京，這時北京，眞是世亂惶惶，祇見洋人到處殺人放火，賽金花打算避難，被聯軍統帥部下軍官繫住，因而得見聯軍統帥瓦德齊，這位瓦德齊將軍原來是賽金花在德國做欽差夫人時所認識的好朋友，於是便在西太后的寢宮儀鸞殿裏住下來。</p>
<p>那時賽金花趁着聯軍軍糧鬧恐慌，提出要聯軍停止在北京殺人放火等行動的條件，答應替聯軍收買軍糧。這樣，眞不知救全了多少北京的老百姓。</p>
<p>李鴻章和瓦德齊的交涉，談判十分感到棘手。只要爭得西太后個人的體面，情願答應一切條件，可是德國的克林德夫人是要中國的皇太后向她謝罪的。這交涉就難辦了。問題的關鍵都在瓦德齊的身上，但又誰能去說項呢？這時胸有成竹的李中堂大人把解决問題的責任完全寄托在賽金花身上。賽金花說服了克林德失人，答應瓦德齊的三大要求，（這自然是李鴻章的意見）把交涉辦妥了。西太后沾了她的光，才回到北京來。</p>
<p>一些從洋人跟洋人走狗巴結到功名的官兒，都升了官了，大家忘記賽金花的功勞，而且妬恨她。賽金花呢？瓦德齊去了以後，她沒有收到西太后的酬謝，依舊開着妓院。爲了妓院出了一件人命案，那些妬恨他的官兒，趁比加以傷風敗俗虐斃人命」的罪名。把賽金花的家產歸公發賣，押解回籍，不許再住北京。</p>
<p>賽金花恨極了，說：「看你們威風到幾時？現在賽金花還住在北平，　近報紙上我們還看到山東省主席韓復渠給她國幣百元的津貼的消息。可是那些威風時的官兒呢？（完）</p>

As a result of the discussions, the opinions of both sides were slightly closer, but no conclusion was reached. It is hoped that further talks can be scheduled. Furthermore, after his sixth meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang on the 26th of last month, Kawagoe took half a month to carefully consider the matter, before holding the seventh meeting yesterday. All parties paid close attention. Although yesterday's meeting showed slight progress, no conclusion was reached, and an eighth meeting will be held in the near future. It was previously reported that Kawagoe planned to take some time to visit Shanghai, but it is said that this will only be possible after the talks have made some progress.

The talks lasted two and a half hours, ending at 5:30 PM. After this seventh round of talks, the opinions of the two sides, China and Japan, have gradually become closer.

<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying previously telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting permission to return home on leave to offer condolences for the death of Duan Qirui. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering that it is currently a busy time for Sino-Japanese diplomacy, has decided that it is not necessary for him to leave his post for the time being.

According to Prince A's representative, Ba Wenjun, who spoke to reporters, Prince A had a very good impression of his travels in Hangzhou and Shanghai and praised the beauty of West Lake. Due to the tight situation on the Suiyuan border, he is scheduled to return to Suiyuan on Friday or Saturday of this week to take charge. He originally planned to travel to Luoyang to pay his respects to President Jiang, but due to time constraints, he will return directly to Suiyuan. Ba continued, saying that various authorities in Beijing have presented gifts because it was Prince A's first time traveling south and he is about to leave Beijing. In recent days, he has received many gifts from President Jiang, President Yu, President Dai, Chief of Staff Cheng, Secretary-General Weng, and others. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Security Department to Convene a Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Security Command will convene a meeting of relevant agencies at 3:00 PM on the 12th to tighten security inside and outside the city. Preparations for winter defense in Tianjin have been completed and will begin on the 15th.

<h3>Small-Scale Conflict Occurs on the Suiyuan-North Front; Mongol Troops Attack from the Bailingmiao Area; Testing the Strength of the Defending Troops, They Are Repelled; Wang Ying and Bao Yueqing Fly from Tianjin to Shangdu; Transportation Between Chengde and Chahar-North Becomes Increasingly Busy</h3>
<p>(Guihua) The Mongol puppet bandits and their troops have been in contact with the Suiyuan-North militia and defense forces for days, without success. The situation in Wuchuan is tight. Zhuo Shihai's troops of over 3,000 are moving from the cattle and sheep herds towards Bailingmiao, intending to join with Bao Yueqing's Mongol army to spy on Suiyuan-North, He Wuchuan Guihua. Wang Ying's troops are waiting for other Mongol bandits and troops to concentrate in Bailingmiao before invading Guyang to the west. If successful, Wang will directly spy on Baotou to the west, hoping to enter the Hetao region. A portion of Li Shouxin's forces and all of Zhang Haipeng's and Wang Jingxiu's forces are attacking Suiyuan-East together. Li himself is currently in Shangdu, directing everything. The puppet bandits' general station has been moved to Dolun, and De Wang will go to Bailingmiao within days. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news received from Chinese sources today, Mongol troops attacked Chinese defense outposts from the Bailingmiao area yesterday. Several small-scale conflicts have occurred on the Suiyuan-North front. The attackers' purpose is clearly to test the strength of Suiyuan Province's defenses. They were repelled at the time. According to reliable estimates, the total number of "Manchukuo" Mongol troops under Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, and Zhuo Xihai is no less than 30,000, with several tanks and armored vehicles assisting them. The situation along the border is extremely tense. However, the Suiyuan army will definitely fight bravely to resist the enemy's numbers. The Ping-Sui Railway is still operating normally. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Ying and Bao Yueqing secretly completed negotiations in Tianjin. They still took a certain country's military plane and flew back to Shangdu on the morning of the 10th. A certain military department's military attaché stationed in Zhang accompanied them. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qinghua students held a general meeting and decided to stop coal fires for five days, raising over one thousand yuan to donate to the Suiyuan-East national army, expressing their condolences. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yueqing, director of the Chahar Mongol Political Council's office in Beiping, was transferred to a military post in Mongolia. Deqian sent a telegram to Beiping today, appointing Zhao Nasutu to succeed him as director. Because the council has been ordered to change its name to the Chahar League Banner Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee, a special order was issued at the same time to reorganize the office and change its name. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pi-Lian, Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, talked about the situation in Chahar-North. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has not received detailed reports, and even De Wang has not sent a telegram to report recently, so the truth is unknown. Yan Xishan, Director of Shanxi Province, has sent some telegrams in recent days and is very concerned about this matter. He has ordered Chuan Zuoyi to stop the bandit and puppet troops from entering the Suiyuan border. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangbei said that after the puppet bandit troops of Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Jin Jiashan, and others arrived in Bailingmiao, discipline was chaotic, and the Mongol people could not bear the harassment and felt deep resentment. They are also quite opposed to Bao Yueqing's attempt. Currently, the Mongol army is in a state of war-weariness, and there is a movement brewing to expel the puppet bandits. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Pingdiquan said that our defensive fortifications in the area are solid, the firearms are well-equipped, and the ammunition is sufficient. The bandit army cannot cross the Lei Pond by one step. However, flour is expensive, and one yuan can only buy thirteen catties of black flour. The monthly salary of a first-class soldier is six yuan, and more than four yuan must be deducted for food. If it continues to rise, the soldiers will not be able to maintain themselves. The local authorities are currently holding meetings to stabilize prices to avoid a military food panic. The bandit army's outposts and our army's outposts are only separated by a road to Taolin, and the two sides are separated by no more than a hundred steps. The bandit army's outposts often greet our outposts, expressing their intention to leave. The bandit army's morale is disintegrating. Although the salary is received from a certain party, the bandit leader Wang Ying does not dare to distribute it, fearing that once the salary is in hand, they will leave together, and he is in a dilemma. (10th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, after a part of the Mongol army was transferred to Bailingmiao, the puppet troops of Li Shouxin, Wang Ying, Jin Jiashan, and others also arrived one after another. The order was quite chaotic, and the Mongol people were unable to bear the disturbances and were quite dissatisfied with them. The current Mongol army has a state of participation in the war, and will expel the puppet troops from the territory. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Aircraft from a certain party have been flying over various parts of Suiyuan-East for days to reconnoiter, paying attention to railway traffic west of Pingdiquan. A person from Zhangbei said that the transport of military supplies between Chengde and Chahar-North has recently become increasingly busy. More than 200 large trucks travel back and forth every day. The cattle and horses of the various banners in Chahar-North have been conscripted in large numbers and are going to the front line for transport. The area north of the Jining-Zhangbei highway is the bandit army's foremost outpost. The two sides are several miles apart, and the atmosphere is extremely tense. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Mongol people have not recovered from last year's snow disaster, and this time they have been ravaged by puppet bandits again, suffering unspeakably. The calamity is unprecedented. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Japanese Residents Association Reorganizes with a Militia System; Militia Commander's Salary Equivalent to a Division Commander's</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Japanese Residents Association is strengthening its organization and reorganizing with a militia system, which has been approved by the Consulate General. The initial militia commander, Shirakawa, receives an annual salary and housing allowance of 12,000 yuan, equivalent to the treatment of a division commander. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Smugglers in Fuzhou Resist</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Yesterday, a Japanese national and a group of Taiwanese smugglers attempted to use force to recover a batch of wool smuggled goods seized by the customs, resulting in a serious conflict with the Chinese police. After resisting, the police finally drove the group away. However, the smugglers then surrounded the residence of William, the American Customs Commissioner, attempting to intimidate him and demand the return of the confiscated smuggled goods. At that time, William's personal safety was in danger. Fortunately, at the request of the American Consul, a Japanese official intervened and dispersed the crowd. The customs authorities praised the police's actions, saying that this shows that the Chinese authorities will take more stringent measures to prevent smuggling. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Ping-Shen Railway Cancels Armed Cars</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ping-Shen Railway has cancelled armed cars. The escort police will ride in ordinary third-class passenger cars, and the Japanese military police will ride in ordinary second-class cars. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Guangxi Army Uniformly Changes its Designation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guangxi Army was originally organized into three armies and one independent division, with Liao Lei, Li Pinxian, Xia Wei, and Qu Shounian serving as army and division commanders. At the end of this month, they will uniformly use the designation of the Central Fifth Route Army. Bai Chongxi will report to Beijing after the formalities are completed. Guangxi Province's finances have a total monthly income of only 800,000 to 1,000,000 yuan, with a huge deficit. The Central Government subsidizes 600,000 yuan per month. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is discussing reorganization methods with Huang Xuchu by telegram. Once everything is ready, experts will be sent to Guangxi for inspection. Mai Huanzhang is still staying in Beijing, waiting to meet with Chairman Jiang. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Province Prevents Embankment Construction Malpractice</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Government is paying attention to the construction and defense of the Jianghan embankments and has issued measures to prevent embankment construction malpractice, strictly prohibiting private subcontracting.

<h3>Zhang Yunrong Visits Tashiro and Others to Discuss Sino-Japanese Aviation; Zhuan and Tashiro to Visit Itagaki in Changchun to Exchange Opinions on the Situation and Economic Development</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Yunrong visited Tashiro, Ikeda, Horiuchi, and others on the 10th to discuss aviation matters. At noon, he went to Song's residence in the British Concession to report to Song. Song is scheduled to return to Beiping by special train at 4:00 PM on the 11th. Qi Xieyuan, Ge Dingyuan, Zhang Yunrong, and others will accompany him. Li Sihao will fly back to report before the 15th and will meet with Ikeda in Tianjin on the 17th to discuss economic development matters. Matsushiro left Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 10th and returned to Beiping. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese military plans to have Major Zhuan Tian take the night train on the 10th to Changchun to pay his respects to Chief of Staff Itagaki on Tashiro's orders and exchange opinions on the situation and economy. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Zhong Company, supported by a portion of financial cliques, still plans to increase capital to become the main agency for developing the North China economy. This is clearly in opposition to the Tianjin military's policy of controlled investment. Zhuan Tian is going to Changchun to negotiate and intends to cooperate with the Kwantung Army to stop the company's proposal to increase capital. (10th Incident Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Nishi, the Japanese advisor to the Hebei Provincial Government, went to Tianjin to pay his respects to Song and discuss official business with the Tianjin Japanese military. He returned to Beiping tonight. (10th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsushiro, an attaché of the Tianjin Japanese Garrison, went to Tianjin to attend the Tianjin conference and returned to Beiping today. Military Attaché Hamada accompanied him. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Chinese sources, Japanese capitalists are reluctant to invest in the North China economic development matters sponsored by the Xingzhong Company. The company is an affiliated agency of the South Manchuria Railway and is organized specifically to promote economic development in North China. It is reported that Tashiro, commander of the Japanese army stationed in North China, and Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee, discussed matters in Tianjin. A staff officer under Tashiro flew to Changchun this morning to report to the Kwantung Army on the discussions between Song Zheyuan and Tashiro. The aviation line between North China and "Manchukuo" will reportedly begin on November 17th. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tashiro, commander of the Japanese garrison, inspected Tongzhou and has now returned here by car. Yin Rugeng came along in another car. Tashiro hosted a banquet for him tonight. Yin's Secretary-General Chi Zongmo and others were also present. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Issues a Statement: There Are No Secrets in My Suggestions; Economic Cooperation is Under Study</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan told reporters that the four people he personally admires least are: (1) Shi Kefa; (2) Wen Tianxiang; (3) Hong Chengchou; (4) Wu Sangui. Shi knew that the general trend was over, but still clung to Yangzhou and shed blood, causing the people to suffer, which was ignorance. Wen sacrificed himself to become benevolent, fulfilling his lonely loyalty, and only won personal heroic honor. Hong was the first person in the Biography of Two Ministers. Wu vented his personal anger and colluded with foreign forces to kill his compatriots. None of these four people are worthy of emulation. The two people he personally admires the most are: (1) Guo Fenyang; (2) Zeng Wenzheng. Guo and Zeng were both able to dedicate themselves to saving the country and stabilizing danger. Their personalities were great and could not be compared with the previous four. He personally strives to be recorded in the pages of history. The current struggle for power has long been put aside. People in a thousand years will have a definite evaluation. Whether it is good or bad, others cannot take it away. Since taking office last year, there have been many rumors. Now it has been a year. There are no secrets in my suggestions. The people of the country should be able to understand. China is not without solutions, but each person is unwilling to take responsibility and still suspects each other. If this malpractice is eliminated and we unite sincerely, we will not want to perish. Who can perish us? The case of North China should also be viewed in this way. Someone asked me in Beiping a few days ago about the current situation. I told them that if Song is a traitor, please overthrow him immediately. If he is saving the country, please support him immediately. The recent aviation matter is to complete the procedures of the previous case, not a sudden new event. The amount of money is indeed half each from China and Japan. I will use 1.35 million from the provincial government and Yizhong Tobacco Company's tax revenue. It is not entirely funded by the other party. Even economic cooperation requires borrowing money, and I also hold the principles of (1) full payment, (2) cancellation of rebates and handling fees, and (3) reduced interest. I have ordered experts to study with the other party. Currently, except for the aviation matter which has been decided, everything else is still under study.

<h3>Drug Traffickers to Be Executed; Anti-Smoking Association Reaffirms Previous Order</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to promote the anti-drug policy, General Supervisor Jiang hopes that the people of the whole country will respect the death penalty for drug trafficking. On February 15, he issued a letter to the people of the whole country, which roughly stated that all those who manufacture morphine, coca, heroin, and various other poisons, as well as those who transport, sell, or hold the aforementioned drugs with the intention of selling them, and those who intend to profit by injecting morphine for others, or who provide opium dens for people to smoke drugs, will be sentenced to death. Even attempted offenders will be punished. As for those who inject morphine or use drugs, they will also be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than three years but not more than seven years within this year. If they voluntarily give up, relapse or take drugs again within this year after giving up, they will be sentenced to death. Those who commit the first offense at the beginning of the 26th year will also be sentenced to death. At the same time, the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Drug Crimes promulgated by the National Government last month also stipulate this. The Anti-Smoking Association believed that the 25th year was coming to an end and the 26th year was about to begin. It has now reaffirmed the previous order, calling on the people of the whole country to pay close attention. At present, provinces and cities have begun to carry out an expanded anti-drug propaganda campaign, urging drug addicts to voluntarily give up within this year to avoid the death penalty.

<h3>X-Ray of Fujian (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Guangya</p>
<p>The internal maladies of Fujian do not require as detailed a description as external afflictions. In a nutshell, it is simply a matter of "impoverished people and exhausted resources." Although this is an old cliché, the examples are very vivid.</p>
<p>"Impoverished people" encompasses the economic bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of urban industry and commerce. "Exhausted resources" can represent the imbalance of revenue and expenditure in government finances. Despite resorting to killing the goose to get the egg, the monthly shortfall still amounts to more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the political objectives of "stability and construction" previously declared by the provincial authorities, as well as the recently actively promoted "control policies," have not easily achieved satisfactory results. The reason is largely due to the difficulty of making bricks without straw. Sometimes, due to the scramble to compensate, other adverse effects are triggered. For example, in a large and prosperous county in southern Fujian, the monthly revenue from flower (brothel) tax is considerable. A certain military unit requested an appropriation as a subsidy. The finance department considered it no different from cutting off a lifeline and insisted it was unacceptable. As a result, the military unit issued an order to ban prostitution (?), ceasing the collection of flower tax. "If I cannot have it, neither shall you." The two sides ended up not understanding each other. The hardship of financial difficulties can be seen in full.</p>
<p>Regarding the phenomenon of impoverished people, a friend who once served as an assistant in the special party branch of a certain division in northern Fujian and concurrently as an instructor for the militia training in Zhenghe County in the First Pacification Zone of Fujian, said to others, "The people in northern Fujian are truly extremely poor! When I went to various places to guide the organization of baojia (household registration system) and train militia, the required expenses were collected from the people on the spot, two jiao (cents) per household, with the extremely poor being appropriately exempted. However, the general populace are all people on the hunger line, who is not extremely poor? It's really impossible to distinguish. If we were to exempt, then everyone would have to be exempted, but then there would be no way to raise funds. Some even sent the eggs prepared for pregnant women as payment, it was truly tragic!" The tax collector even felt pity for the people, sighing, "Truly tragic!" To what extent are the people truly impoverished? It is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The reflection of impoverished people is even more frightening than the phenomenon of impoverished people itself. A commissioner who was engaged in grain investigation work in Zhabei (Shanghai) held an infinite pessimism towards the future of local administration in northern Fujian, saying, "The counties have already brewed a serious situation of 'the people fear the government, and the government also fears the people!'" (See Fujian Provincial Statistical Times, Volume 2, Issue 2.) Indeed, in China, it is the natural order for the people to fear the government, but it is a rare wonder for the government to fear the people. Not long ago, when this reporter passed through northern Fujian, a car driver told me, "Because the military is concentrated on the main transportation lines, riding in a car is not afraid of robbery. But in the villages slightly far from the city, it is not safe. Especially personnel from general agencies that levy slaughter, tobacco, and alcohol taxes, as well as various surcharges, simply dare not go out of the city into the countryside, otherwise, danger is unavoidable." Is this not a phenomenon of the government fearing the people?</p>
<p>In various counties in northern Fujian, there is an organization called the "Big Sword Society," which was originally a self-defense group of the people. The members were originally docile farmers, who had helped the government to suppress the Red bandits, establishing merit in their villages. However, later they all successively became bandits and were at odds with the government. What is the reason? It is because the front door repelled the Red Army, and the back door brought harsh taxes and oppression, thus forcing them onto Liangshan (to become outlaws). Their identity is between the people and bandits. The number is difficult to count, and the spread has no clear boundaries, so it is very difficult to deal with. If a large army is used to suppress them, innocent people are often killed by mistake, and even more suspicion is aroused among the people, leading them to join the activities of the "society bandits." It is better to follow the suppression method (90% political, 10% military) and implement good policies to revive the people's livelihood. In other words, it is necessary to substantially reduce the burden on the people. Then the people will not only never become bandits, but even those who have taken the risk will return and take up legitimate occupations. However, if, as the report of the fishermen's representatives from the coastal islands of Fuzhou who went to Beijing to petition last month said, "While the finance department abolishes the fish tax and fishery tax, it cleverly establishes new categories and separately levies a business tax on seafood, and separately creates an education donation for fresh fish peddlers in Minhou. Recently, a 50% surcharge has been added to the deed tax throughout the province..." Then it is still far from reducing the burden on the people.</p>
<p>The difficulty in resolving the people's army in southern Fujian is also greatly related to the suffering of the people's livelihood. The so-called people's army seems to be the people's force to protect the people; however, the majority of the people's army in various counties in southern Fujian are disguised names for bandit groups. Their organization and weapons are even more formidable than the society bandits in northern Fujian. A large part of them have now been reorganized into security teams, and a part of the forces are still stubbornly resisting. According to personnel from the Security Department, "The firearms of the unorganized people's army still number 100,000." The main reason why they are difficult to suppress and appease is that "impoverished people become bandits." However, in the past, the government often borrowed the name of appeasement, and then suddenly severely punished their leaders and disarmed them. This can certainly be said to be a successful strategy, but it also has its flaws, that is, the rabbit dies, and the fox grieves, arousing the self-endangerment and resistance of other departments.</p>
<p>In addition, some people (especially the Hakka personnel in government offices) have said, "Once something happens in Fujian, there will definitely be many traitors." Of course, some people are willing to put up foreign signs in peacetime, which is an example. In fact, in addition to true merchants who are willing to be slaves and seek only profit, for the rest of the general "indifferent" ignorant people, we must objectively think for them: If the government has a way to reduce taxes; even if it can abolish unequal treaties, and there is no inducement of extraterritoriality, would there still be those who hang foreign signs and recognize thieves as fathers?</p>
<p>Here are a few more proofs. In Pucheng, northern Fujian, after a primary school student committed suicide out of patriotism, this reporter happened to pass through the area and saw that the general public sentiment was very激越 (passionate and agitated). I also once visited libraries in Yanan, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places, and personally saw that the documents placed on the readers' desks were mostly pictorials and monographs related to the Northeast Incident, the Great Wall Battle, the Songhu War, and historical issues between China and Japan. The slogans for national salvation on the temple walls of Gushan, a scenic spot in Fuzhou, were even more dazzling. (The distance from the city is thirty to forty li, so everyone can express their aspirations). It can be seen that the people of Fujian have not forgotten that matter in their hearts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the South Manchuria Railway Company previously sent personnel to survey the Anxi iron ore and the railway line to the seaport, although the government had allowed it, it was ultimately interrupted due to the fierce opposition of the local people (a little far from Haifeng). The one who investigated the Anxi iron ore even "fled in panic" at night due to the threat of the people's army. Yanping, a key point in northern Fujian, and Longyan, an important town in southern Fujian, in case something happens along the coast, these two places will immediately become the key to the situation of Fujian's gains and losses. People from a certain country often request passports to see, but the actual number of people who go is very few. According to people from the Yanping District Commissioner's Office, "It is not that the government does not provide protection, but in reality, they are still afraid and dare not go." As for the general evil deeds of ronin, they also dare not leave the coastal counties a step.</p>
<p>There was a leader of the people's army in southern Fujian, Chen Guocai. After he fled to Hong Kong before, someone knew his potential influence and chased after him to persuade him, saying that it was not worth it for him to work for the Chinese government, and that if he was willing to join a certain Great Alliance, there would be great development. However, his answer was very straightforward: "I would rather be slapped by my own family than let outsiders slap my palm!" Later, he returned to Gulangyu (Xiamen), and was introduced to see him by a friend in the same industry, asking him about the vigorous activities of the people's army, and the truth about certain parties using them. He said: "Using the name of mobilizing the people's army to swindle money from certain parties, some people have indeed done it. As for saying that the people's army would be willing to be traitors who will be infamous for ten thousand years, that will never happen. If forced to do so, they can only be bandits." I felt that these words were also heartfelt.</p>
<p>The most frightening thing is that, as it is said in a "Secret Political Report on the Invasion of North China" by a certain country's special service agency stationed in Peiping, "The activities of most ronin have been very effective. This further reveals the complacency and incompetence of the Chinese government, increasing the people's resentment and disappointment towards the government." If this phenomenon also exists in unfortunate Fujian, then it will become an incurable internal disease. However, based on the current situation in Fujian, I don't think it will happen. In summary: although Fujian's maladies have internal and external divisions, the true demons that are wreaking havoc are actually two in one. For example, the financial difficulties that are the crux of the province and the problem of the inability to reduce the burden on the people are greatly affected by the external affliction of "smuggling" and the disturbance of ronin. When the newly appointed Ambassador to Russia, Jiang Tingfu, set out to go abroad, he said in his farewell speech, "A country's diplomacy can never succeed with methods of 'begging for pity' and 'kowtowing.' … Only when 'upper' and 'lower' are united and unwilling to concede lightly to the outside world will our country have a way out." Fujian does not want to remove external afflictions, and only treat internal injuries: if it wants to stand up from chronic illness and strive to be promising, it should at least do as Jiang said!

<h3>South Manchuria Railway Actively Promoting New Capital Increase Plan to be Implemented over Six Years from Next Year Totaling 720 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), based on the 510 million yuan capital five-year plan established this spring by expanding the issuance limit of company bonds, subsequently had new investment conditions such as the Fourth Railway Investment and related business expansion and production increase plan. With the payment of unpaid government shares as a prerequisite, and with the necessity of a new capital plan, Mantetsu President Matsuoka went to Tokyo to negotiate with the Japanese government regarding the payment of shares, and attached the five-year plan established this spring to the new capital plan, taking the form of an addition. As a result of Mantetsu's research on the reconstruction of the practical capital plan, no changes were made to internal company affairs, and the expansion of investment in external investment departments was acknowledged. Based on this intention, a bond policy was established, and the new capital plan, according to observations, will last for six years from Japanese Showa 12 (next year) to the end of Showa 17. The policy has been decided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) 220 million yuan for the Fourth Railway Investment;</p>
<p>(2) 40 million yuan for the capital increase of the Manchuria Coal Mining Company;</p>
<p>(3) 120 million yuan for the capital increase of Showa Steel Works;</p>
<p>(4) 300 million yuan in total for the reorganization and capital increase of Xingzhong Corporation, etc., for this investment.</p>
<p>However, Mantetsu's investment in Northeast China is not limited to the above. In addition, it will also implement projects such as expanding the coal liquefaction business, developing the Northeast industry, participating in the five-year industry plan, and cultivating new money, developing North Manchurian farmland, etc. There are also issues such as developing North China's economic funds. The trend of promoting the establishment of a three-year Mantetsu capital plan is necessary. Mantetsu has considered this point and, before concretization, has started the fourth capital plan based on the above investment views.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>He Huai's Talk</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>American newspaper magnate He Huai recently delivered a noteworthy speech in Manila. Based on his keen observations in recent years, he frankly analyzed the current situation between China and Japan. His tone expressed deep sympathy for the Chinese nation's self-awareness and progress. He is one of the two major leaders of the American newspaper industry. In this American election, He Huai's newspapers enthusiastically supported Roosevelt, while the Hearst newspapers opposed him. Now that Roosevelt has won a landslide victory and has been re-elected president, what views do he and the majority of Americans take on the Sino-Japanese issue? What trends will there be in American diplomacy in the future? It is not difficult to see some clues in He Huai's speech. From this point of view, He Huai's speech is indeed of nearly the same significance as Stimson's "The Far Eastern Crisis."</p>
<p>In his speech, which seemed to be intentionally delivered, He Huai emphasized China's progress and unity. He said, "China has expressed a firm stance towards Japan, and the situation is about to change dramatically. The European and American countries must be surprised and take notice that China has achieved recovery and unification. In other words, Europeans and Americans must readjust their judgments and evaluations of China." He also cited the large knives given by the Chinese people to the army three years ago and the large squadrons of aircraft presented by people from various places for Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday last week as a comparison, saying that "the evolution of the Sino-Japanese situation can be seen from this. In short, the sleeping lion of China has awakened." This tone not only expresses deep sympathy for "China's firm stance," but more importantly, it warns the world powers not to regard China as an incompetent semi-colony. Of course, we Chinese should rely on full national self-confidence to strive for self-reliance. We cannot be complacent because of a few compliments from a foreign friend. But we should always think about how friendly people who are not involved are cheering so enthusiastically for our spirit of revival. How should we, who are struggling, strive to improve ourselves?</p>
<p>Another noteworthy point in He Huai's speech is that he frankly and clearly explained the current situation of the Sino-Japanese negotiations. He said, "Japan's current two basic conditions are: one is joint anti-communism, and the other is formal recognition of the special status of North China. The first condition requires recognition of the right of the Japanese army to cooperate with the Chinese army in various parts of China, which is tantamount to recognizing the legal right of the Japanese army to be stationed in China. The second condition is actually destroying China's unity, which China cannot recognize." The negotiations for adjusting relations between China and Japan have gone through seven rounds to this day, but it seems that there have been no concrete results in essence. The crux of the matter is clearly the two basic conditions put forward by the Japanese side, as He said. These two conditions infringe on China's sovereignty and territory and put our nation in a position of irrecoverable destruction. We certainly cannot tolerate them. But we must also understand that for the benefit of all mankind, from the perspective of the overall international situation, we must not accept such two conditions. In today's world, the international fascist forces represented by Germany and Italy are attempting to trigger an unprecedented catastrophe for mankind. The Spanish Civil War is a prominent sign. Japan and Germany have already established a military understanding. Its insistence on joint anti-communism is clearly based on the will to attack the Soviet Union. And its demand for the special status of North China is clearly the ladder to its entire continental policy. The ultimate goal of both can also be said to be to arrange a vast line of aggression to provoke a world war. Now on the international stage in Europe, the arrogance of fascism is superficially very rampant. In fact, the universally existing international democratic forces, as long as they can gather well, can certainly restrain that destructive arrogance. In such an international situation, should we attach ourselves to the forces that destroy world peace and head towards the fate of a colony? Or should we adhere to the status of an independent country to safeguard world peace and stability? These two paths are easy to choose. He Huai did not express this world significance when talking about the situation of Sino-Japanese negotiations. But it is not difficult for us to see that He's sympathy for China is somewhat based on this significance. Because today's America is an important country for international democratic forces.</p>

<h3>Spanish Militia Tenaciously Defends Besieged City</h3>
<p>Rebel Forces Advance with Encirclement and Assaults Corner of Capital Reduced to Rubble</p>
<p>Cordoba National Army aircraft and artillery fiercely bombed Madrid for three days. They have now advanced in several places, but are currently still on the west bank of the Manzanares River and have not yet entered the city. Although the government army was tragically bombed by the National Army's intensive bombs, it still put up a tenacious resistance. The defending army has destroyed the Segovia Bridge and used machine guns mounted on high buildings on the east bank to control the entrance to the bridge. The militia also controls the high buildings on the Talavera Avenue on the east bank. The avenue was constantly bombarded by the National Army's six-inch-caliber cannons today, firing one shell per minute. The front line is now mostly broken. Although the government army still occupies many positions on the west bank of the Manzanares River, in several places on the east bank, it has retreated to the workshops and high buildings to prevent the National Army from crossing the river. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: National Army tanks are now charging forward, covering the advance of the infantry, so that they can open the road for the infantry to follow into the city. However, due to fear of landmines, the tanks are moving very slowly. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Rebel aircraft and heavy artillery have been fiercely bombing the center of Madrid since 8 am this morning, without stopping all day. At least ten people have died in the city, and 162 have been injured. The area where the workers live is also the target of aerial bombing. The government troops swore to resist and once repelled the rebel army. Now the rebel army is still in the suburbs. In the afternoon, five rebel bombers, protected by six pursuit planes, flew to drop 12 bombs, and were subsequently repelled by the government army's pursuit planes. After evening, four rebel bombers and three pursuit planes dropped bombs in various places and strafed with machine guns. (National Power dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Regarding the fighting in the suburbs of Madrid, as of 8 pm tonight, the National Army has not achieved its intended goals. On the contrary, the government army's fierce counterattack in the west of the city has caused the National Army to retreat slightly. This reporter personally went to inspect the area in the afternoon and saw the government troops digging trenches and holding their ground, waiting for the enemy to attack, with a very brave attitude. After a while, the government army's artillery fiercely bombarded the National Army's positions in the southwest. In an instant, the sky was filled with thick smoke and could no longer be distinguished. At 2 pm, eight government army planes flew to the National Army's positions and dropped bombs, inflicting heavy damage. The National Army's artillery also returned fire on the city of Madrid, with many shells falling into the city and destroying many houses. National Army planes also went to the city of Madrid again to drop bombs, one of which was shot down by the government army's anti-aircraft guns and crashed in the city center. The two pilots were killed on the spot. (Havas dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: A large part of this place, after being bombarded by the National Army's artillery and aircraft this afternoon, has now become a rubble field filled with smoke. The residents of the city are now in a state of panic. The Ministry of the Army and the Opera House are now filled with explosive shells. If the National Army can hit one, a large part of the city will be destroyed again. The former Spanish King's Garden in the southern suburbs is mostly under the control of the National Army. Seventeen bombs dropped by the National Army planes fell on the Salamanca district of the city today. Vallegas, five miles southwest of the capital, was also attacked by planes, with 27 killed and injured. According to the orders issued by the government militia, all citizens in the city will participate in street fighting when the National Army enters the city. According to this order: (1) Residents must prepare several bottles of gasoline and throw them at the enemy from the roof after lighting them. (2) All those who belong to the so-called "Fifth Column or Fascist Team" who still remain in the capital must be completely annihilated. (3) Civilians must participate in street fighting, assist in digging trenches, and set up defenses in various houses. (4) Residents must turn each house into a fortress and hold it firmly, regardless of sacrifice. (Reuters dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<p>Suburbs of Madrid: The National Army's plan to encircle Madrid is about to be completed. All roads from the capital to the provinces, except for the one to the port of Barcelona, are now isolated by the militia's desperate defense. Currently, from the Getafe Airport south of the capital to the Manzanares River, the government army is littered with dead bodies along the way, mostly young soldiers and militia members. (Havas dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(London) At 2:30 this afternoon, Reuters established a telephone connection with Madrid and learned that although the National Army's artillery and aircraft fiercely bombed the capital this morning, there were no noteworthy changes in the battle situation. Thirteen people died and 322 were injured in the city during the enemy's bombing yesterday. (Reuters dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The Associated Press today contacted well-informed sources in the Spanish capital via wireless telephone and learned that the situation in Madrid is now critical. The city's defending militia, although trying their best, is unable to save this city in danger under artillery fire. Fierce fighting is still taking place on both banks of the Manzanares River in the suburbs. As of 7:30 this morning, the rebel army has not yet crossed the river, but the people are now quietly awaiting the fall of the capital. (National Power dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Belgium and the Vatican Have Not Considered Recognizing the Rebel Government</h3>
<p>People in the Belgian capital recently announced that the Belgian government has not yet considered recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government. Belgium's attitude will likely shift based on the attitudes of Britain and France. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Justice Minister Bawens recently used wireless broadcasting to warn the people that anyone who enlists voluntarily in foreign armies without government permission will be subject to imprisonment of up to fifteen years. This measure also applies to Spain. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Vatican City: Well-informed sources recently announced that the Holy See has not yet considered recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government. It will likely follow the lead of the major powers. The Spanish embassy to the Holy See recently changed its flag to the red and yellow royal flag. Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Vatican, immediately notified the embassy to remove the royal flag, demonstrating the attitude of the Holy See. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: The Mexican government officially learned today that the Republic of El Salvador has announced its recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government. (National dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War held a meeting today. It is believed that the subcommittee discussed the issue of monitoring Spanish ports and drafted a plan to organize two supervisory committees separately within the territories controlled by the Spanish government forces and the Nationalists to carry out monitoring work. Representatives of the major countries concerned have largely agreed to this plan and are now studying the details and seeking the consent of representatives from other countries attending the Adjustment Committee. It is generally hoped that this monitoring plan will be submitted for discussion when the Adjustment Committee holds a plenary meeting this Thursday. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of enhancing the effectiveness of the Non-Intervention Agreement on the Spanish Civil War, Lord Plymouth, Chairman of the Adjustment Committee and British Foreign Secretary, had previously proposed that Spanish ports and border areas should be monitored. The subcommittee met yesterday and drafted a plan based on this proposal to organize committees within the territories controlled by the Spanish government forces and the Nationalists to be responsible for monitoring. The Soviet delegation is said to have accepted this plan (the Soviet Union originally proposed that Portuguese ports should also be monitored) and proposed inviting Sweden and Norway to send representatives to participate in the monitoring committee. It also stated that special measures should be adopted to prevent countries from smuggling arms by plane. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3>Speculation Rises, Silver Prices Increase as Rumors Spread of Continued Silver Purchases Following US Presidential Election Victory; Silver Committee to Convene Meeting</h3>
<p>(New York) Foreign speculators believe the government will vigorously implement the silver purchasing policy after its election victory, so they purchased a large amount of silver today. On the Handy &amp; Harman exchange, the price of silver rose by two and a half cents to forty-seven and a half cents per ounce. This is the first change since May 19 and the highest price this year. However, this price is only for "foreign silver," as domestic production has long been nationalized. Handy &amp; Harman issued a statement regarding the increase in silver prices, stating that it was influenced by the London market. As for the reason for the sharp rise in silver prices in London, it is understood here that it was due to speculator purchases, especially from Bombay and China. The price difference between New York and London is now only five and two tenths cents. Other markets, such as Montreal, have also risen along with New York prices. (National dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press reported last week that the Senate Silver Committee was about to meet, and this has been confirmed today. It is understood that the government has a variety of materials prepared for the committee to use. These materials will report on the government's silver reserves and the amount of silver recently purchased, and will explain the impact of the government's silver policy on stabilizing world currency and international trade. The meeting date is likely to be within the next week and the location will be Reno. (National dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Bankers here are puzzled by the continued rise in silver prices and do not understand the continued purchases in Bombay. The scarcity of silver imports to London is indeed uncommon, as silver is needed for the manufacture of spoons and forks, resulting in a temporary shortage. It is also rumored that China is withdrawing silver, and it seems that there is still a considerable amount of bullish sentiment in the market, believing that the United States is unlikely to resume its large-scale purchases. Since Roosevelt has been re-elected, there may no longer be a need to appease the silver faction. On the other hand, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau may be forced to purchase silver to prevent the value of the US dollar from becoming too high when exchanged for the British pound.

<h3>Japan's Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Both exports and imports in the first ten days of the month have decreased significantly, reversing the trend of the previous ten days. Exports such as raw silk decreased by 3,447,000 yen and cotton cloth by 6,042,000 yen. Imports such as crude oil decreased by 3,157,000 yen and iron by 3,164,000 yen. The cumulative deficit at the beginning of the first ten days was reduced to 145 million yen. However, the peak export period seems to be coming to an end this ten-day period. For the past two years, the trade balance has usually turned into a deficit from the end of this month. In November and December, the deficit was 30 million yen each month. If the trend continues as it did last year, the trade deficit for this year is expected to be 180 million yen. (Domei dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<p>Central Administrative Structure</p>
<p>(1) Establish an agency to be in charge of investigating and supervising important national affairs, controlling and allocating budget affairs, and reform and strengthen the Information Committee under the Prime Minister's Cabinet and integrate it with this agency. The head of this agency may attend Cabinet meetings. (2) Create an agency to be constantly in charge of controlling and reforming personnel administration, placed under the administration of the Prime Minister. (3) Integrate the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs to plan the control and strengthening of foreign policy. Establish an agency in the Cabinet to manage all affairs related to the Governor-Generals of Korea and Taiwan and the South Seas.

(8) In order to respond to the changing times, each ministry shall organize or improve its content. At the same time, consolidate or reorganize the administrative agencies and research institutes of each ministry that have overlapping responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Local Administrative System</h3>
<p>Following the improvement of the central administrative structure and the progress of national fortunes, reform the local administrative system. Also, in view of the current state of the parliament, amend the election law. In order to implement these key points, first implement the temporary appointment of the ministers. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Claim Pacific Mandated Islands are Not Fortified; League of Nations Discusses Japanese Report Focusing Primarily on Economic Issues</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Mandates Commission recently held a meeting to discuss the Japanese government's annual report on the administrative affairs of the Pacific Mandated Islands. The report covers facts up to 1935 and states that the Japanese government has withdrawn all troops stationed on the islands since 1922, and that there are currently no land, sea, or air military bases on the islands. In addition, the Japanese government is now seeking to develop air transportation in the Pacific, so that airmail lines can be regularly accessible, and plans to establish radio stations on the islands to broadcast weather reports to assist fishing boats and general shipping in the Pacific. The representatives of various countries in the Mandates Commission then asked the Japanese representative, Ito, the ambassador to Poland, about the economic situation of the Pacific islands. Ito replied that the Pacific islands' exports to Japan have increased significantly recently, so the standard of living of the island residents should gradually increase. After the meeting adjourned today, Ito told reporters that no difficulties were raised during today's meeting to discuss the Japanese government's report. All debates in the meeting focused on various economic issues, and the establishment of naval or air force bases and airmail lines on the Pacific islands did not become an issue. (Note: The Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific are the Marshall Islands, Mariana Islands, and Caroline Islands.) (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>US Navy Secrets Sold to Japanese Case; Japanese Military Attaché to be Interrogated</h3>
<p>(Washington) The lawyer for former naval officer Fawkes, who was accused of selling naval secrets to Japan, has obtained permission today to interrogate the Japanese former naval attaché to the US Embassy who is related to the case. This will be handled by the State Department and the Japanese court. (National dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Speech Resolves to Complete Military Preparations, Hopes for Success of the Locarno Conference, Britain Closely Cooperating with Poland</h3>
<p>(London) The new Lord Mayor of London, Sir Broders Bridgeman, held a grand banquet at the City Hall tonight. Many political figures and London celebrities attended the banquet. After the banquet, Prime Minister Baldwin rose to speak to cheers, saying that Britain is willing to support various measures to reduce international trade barriers. Britain has already contributed by not engaging in competitive currency devaluations and by committing to implementing a non-exclusive import policy. The Prime Minister welcomed the Anglo-Italian commercial agreement. The relations between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean are not conflicting, but harmonious. Foreign Secretary Eden has already announced British foreign policy in the House of Commons, so there is no need to repeat it. However, one thing that the government pays special attention to is the Locarno Conference. We hope this conference will be the first step in resolving the European situation. British and American economic policies both aim to free the world from the shackles of international trade and have a sincere desire to assist world peace, which is also gratifying. The Anglo-Egyptian agreement will surely be a lasting factor of peace in the eastern Mediterranean. We welcome Egypt as an ally (cheers throughout the room). The Prime Minister then mentioned Spain, saying that Britain is still working hard to persuade both sides to cease fire and prevent civilians from suffering unnecessary harm. The Prime Minister then welcomed Polish Foreign Minister Beck, who arrived in London yesterday, saying that the close cooperation between Britain and Poland has a bright future. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that all of Europe is now arming, and it is foolish to hinder the international trade that Europeans rely on to improve their lives. His concluding remark was: "I am now prepared to do my best to complete our country's defenses regardless of the cost, but I am always conscientiously aware of its folly." Then, Secretary of War Cooper rose to speak about the need to unify the British defense forces, saying that the Military Advisory Council has appointed a naval lieutenant general to join the War Office, and he expects that the Admiralty will also appoint an army general to participate in the Ministry's affairs.

<h3>Polish Army Inspector General Promoted to General Ceremony</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Following the recent promotion of General Ritz-Smigly, the Inspector General of Army Education, to the rank of general, President Moscicki held a grand ceremony at the Presidential Palace, the former Warsaw Palace Palace, this afternoon, granting him the insignia. Prominent cabinet members, church authorities, and senior civil and military officials in the capital all participated. When the general went to the Presidential Palace, the crowd shouted in apology, which was extremely prosperous. After the completion of the ceremony, General Ritz-Smigly inspected the army. Afterwards, President Moscicki issued a statement saying that the general "has fought bravely for the Polish independence movement for many years and has made outstanding contributions. His performance as a military commander is also outstanding and can serve as a model for the people of the whole country." The government loves and appoints him as a general to show its utmost gratitude. According to records, since the re-establishment of Poland, there have only been three military personnel appointed as generals: one is the late dictator General Pilsudski, one is the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces during the European War, the famous French general Foch, and the other is Ritz-Smigly himself. In fact, Ritz is the family name, and Smigly means swift. Up until the European War, he was given this name by his army comrades. (Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Opium Smuggling into US Case, Winnie Manli Trial Postponed</h3>
<p>Los Angeles: The trial date for Winnie Manli, a Shanghai woman, who was arrested for attempting to smuggle 50,000 yuan of narcotics into the country has been indefinitely postponed.

<h3>The Military Suppression of Bandits in Sichuan Ends - Construction Undertakings Become Increasingly Urgent - The Provincial Government Actively Cleans Up Land Taxes - The Construction Department Plans to Open New Rivers</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: Recently, important figures in Sichuan, such as the Director of the Xingying (Military Headquarters) Gu Zhutong, Chief of Staff He Guoguang, Director of the First Office Han Deqin, and Special Financial Commissioner of Sichuan Province Guan Jiyu, have come to the province one after another to meet with Chairman Liu and discuss matters before returning to Chongqing. Liu Hangchen, Director of the Sichuan Finance Department, and Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department, also came to the province one after another. Due to their duties, Liu and Lu often travel to Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, spending very little time in the province. During this return, they visited Chairman Liu several times to discuss various issues. It is reported that the content of the discussions mainly concerned the post-disaster recovery, construction, and finance of Sichuan Province. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Military Expenses for Bandit Suppression - Cessation of Allocation</p>
<p>The military expenses for bandit suppression in Sichuan Province have been managed by the Financial Supervision Office, jointly organized by the central and local authorities, since the establishment of the Xingying in Sichuan. The amount was determined to be 2 million yuan per month. The source of funds was originally a triple surcharge on grain taxes, that is, collecting one year's worth of grain and adding a three-fold surcharge for bandit suppression expenses. If the funds were insufficient, the Xingying would request the Military Commission to allocate additional funds. The distribution method was to allocate funds to the participating bandit suppression troops according to whether they were directly suppressing or assisting in the suppression. Since last year, this surcharge for bandit suppression has been levied in practice. The collection bureaus in each county submit the funds to the Financial Supervision Office on a monthly basis, and then the Financial Supervision Office forwards them to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters at the end of each month for distribution to the various bandit suppression troops. However, since the levy of bandit suppression expenses began, there have been many arrears, and the actual amount received each month has averaged only 1.5 million yuan. According to the amount determined by the Xingying, there is still a shortfall of 500,000 yuan. This shortfall was supplemented by central government funds. However, considering the current situation, the remaining bandits have long fled, and the various troops have been demobilized. Since the military suppression of bandits has come to an end, there is no need to continue allocating military expenses for bandit suppression to the various armies. After discussions between Director Gu, Chief of Staff He, and Chairman Liu, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Duban Shu (Military Governor's Office) have jointly issued an order to all departments to stop the allocation of funds from November onwards in order to save national funds. As for the troops participating in the bandit suppression in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area, they have now been transferred to the command of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang. The bandit suppression expenses they should receive from now on will be directly allocated by the Xingying.</p>
<p>Cleaning Up Land Taxes - Compensating for Military Expenses</p>
<p>Since the bandit suppression expenses will be stopped from this month, the bandit suppression surcharges collected locally must also be stopped in practice. However, since the unification of the Sichuan Army, the monthly military expenses have largely relied on this bandit suppression surcharge to supplement them. If it is stopped, there will inevitably be panic regarding military expenses. It is said that the authorities have prepared a solution. It is rumored that during this transition period, the bandit suppression surcharge will still be collected temporarily, while actively cleaning up land taxes. In the future, the surplus grain tax will be used to cover military expenses. The grain tax in Sichuan Province has never been cleaned up in the past, even though it was often collected five or six times a year before the district defense system was abolished. As a result, there is a lot of unassessed grain. Once the cleanup is completed and taxes are levied according to the assessed grain, the province's income will increase by more than 20 million. Moreover, although the grain tax in Sichuan Province is currently levied once a year, with the addition of a three-fold surcharge for bandit suppression expenses, it is actually equivalent to four collections a year. Therefore, the burden on the people has not been reduced much. This cleanup of land taxes by the authorities is a step towards implementing a one-year collection in the future. It will not only enrich the provincial treasury and take into account the issue of military expenses, but also reduce the burden on the people and avoid the malpractice of high taxes for low grain and low taxes for high grain. It is indeed a measure that achieves multiple goals.</p>
<p>Construction Bonds - Successful Discounting of Cash</p>
<p>The finances of Sichuan Province have long been exhausted due to the expenses of military bandit suppression over the years. Since the bandits fled, the province's insufficient funds in the past one or two years have relied entirely on public bonds to maintain operations. Last year, a type of Sichuan Province Post-Disaster Recovery Bond for the 24th year was issued, amounting to 50 million, to handle all post-disaster recovery administrative affairs. However, it was still short by 10 million. This year, it has also requested the central government to issue 45 million Sichuan Province Construction Bonds, which have been approved. The first 30 million will be issued first, and the remaining 15 million will be issued next spring. The use of these bonds has also been stipulated, with 10 million to repay the 24th-year provincial budget deficit in administrative expenses, and 20 million to be used for construction, including 8.5 million to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, 4.5 million to build highways, and the remaining 7 million to be used for the development of industry. These bonds have begun to be issued. Regarding the discounting matters, Liu Hangchen and Lu Zuofu have separately contacted the Shanghai banking community and have successfully negotiated an agreement, which involves discounting each 10 million for 4 million in cash, totaling only 12 million in cash. At a time when the province's finances are extremely depleted, this cash can only barely cope with various construction projects.</p>
<p>Opening New Rivers - A Grand Plan - Regarding the construction issues in Sichuan Province, in addition to starting the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, it is said that the Construction Department also has a grand plan to dig a river in the Guanxian area between the Minjiang and Tuojiang Rivers. The Tuojiang and Minjiang Rivers are originally two major rivers, the inner and outer rivers, that branch out from Dujiangyan. During the summer, when floods break out, the outer river is prone to overflowing, while the inner river has a smaller water volume. However, its water volume is somewhat insufficient to irrigate the vast farmland of western Sichuan. In order to regulate the water volume of the two rivers, the Construction Department plans to open a new river between the two rivers, diverting the water from the outer river into the inner river. Negatively, it can eliminate water disasters, and positively, it can release its power to irrigate farmland. After the two rivers are connected in the future, there are also plans to use a large amount of water from the inner river to install tap water pipes in Chengdu. The Construction Department has contacted the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Company and has sent a representative to the province to investigate first. It is reported that the company has designated Mr. Yunboer as its representative and will send him to the province by plane on the 4th with a chief engineer to carry out everything. In terms of water conservancy, the authorities of the Construction Department have indeed put in a lot of effort. However, the river-digging project is extremely difficult, and the funds required are not small. It is reported that after the authorities have drafted the plan, they will submit it to the provincial government for approval and begin implementation.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of the Fishing Industry in Guangdong and Fujian - Japanese Fishermen Cast Nets in the Coastal Waters of Fujian and Guangdong - Attracting Fishermen from Nan'ao to be Utilized - The Fishing Industry in Guangdong Cannot Withstand the Pressure of Taxes - The Government Should Protect and Seek Relief</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian are rich and prosperous areas for the production of fish and salt. In recent years, the country has been unsettled, pirates have been rampant, and taxes have been increased, making life difficult for the people. In addition to the regular taxes on salt, various surcharges, as well as protection fees, inspection fees, weighing fees, and other fees along the way, amount to as many as 56 types. In the Chao-Shan area, which produces salt, one yuan can only buy 15 catties of salt on the market. The fishing industry is also the same. The burden of taxes on fishing boats and fishermen is unparalleled. Fishermen cannot afford to pickle salted fish or make fish sauce due to the high price of salt. Even if they do, the tax bureaus often oppress and harass them, making it impossible for them to survive and develop. Eventually, fishermen lose their jobs, and Japanese fishing boats take the opportunity to take their place. The Zhaolin, Dagang, Huanggang, Jingzhou, Yanzao, Nan'ao, Yun'ao, Long'ao, Qing'ao, Dahaohai, Haimen, Shenquan, Wojiao, Jieshi, Zhelang, Jinxiang, Jiazi, Houmen, Mazong, Shanwei, Dapeng Bay, Pingshan, and even the Hong Kong area of the Chao-Shan area are natural and excellent fishing grounds. In recent years, Japanese fishing boats have invaded territorial waters to fish, causing more than 500,000 fishermen to lose their jobs. Many have been displaced due to hunger and cold. The living conditions of the unemployed fishermen in Nan'ao County are truly pitiful. The failure of China's fishing industry has the following reasons: (1) There is no large-scale capital organization, so it is impossible to go to the deep sea to fish. (2) Fishing tools still follow ancient methods. There is no affordable salt for pickling, no refrigerators for storage, no large electric boats for transporting fish, and no new-style electric nets for fishing. They have to rely on wind power to sail and use old-fashioned nets to catch fish. The above are the fundamental reasons for the failure of China's fishing industry. The Provincial Government established a fishing school in Wutian, Jiaoshi, Shantou two years ago. Because the location is far from the fishing grounds for practical training, it has now been decided to move the school site to the Zhaozhong Temple in Xishe, Shanwei. In short, without the abolition of various harsh taxes on fish and salt, it is difficult for the fishing industry to be revitalized. In August of this year, a Japanese fishing company sent personnel to Nan'ao to form a fishing association with local fishermen with a capital of 100,000 yuan. It was decided to send four new-style fishing boats to fish in the coastal waters of Fujian and Guangdong and sell the catch to Shantou and Hong Kong. This association has been established. Last month, Japanese people went to Nan'ao and nearby small islands such as Nanpeng to recruit fishermen to Taiwan. Because the local people have been drifting at sea since childhood and are used to ocean life, their fishing results are excellent. Those who are recruited sign a three-year contract and receive a monthly salary of 30 yuan. One month's living expenses are paid in advance. If family members are willing to go together, the travel expenses will be provided by the association. After arriving in Taiwan, the association will also help them settle down. As a result, many fishermen from Nan'ao have been recruited and left their hometowns. It is rumored that the Japanese covet the fishing industry in the coastal waters of Fujian and Guangdong, so they recruit ordinary fishermen and train them as basic cadres. Last year, the Nan'ao District Township Office discovered that an increasing number of unemployed fishermen were taking their families to Taiwan and issued a notice to prohibit it. However, the hungry had no way to arrange things, and the written prohibition was completely ineffective. Nan'ao County has a total population of more than 50,000, with farming accounting for 30% and fishing accounting for 70%. Now there are only more than 34,000 people. Most of the young and strong have left the county. Recently, the coastal situation has been tense. The Japanese are not only absorbing a large number of fishermen but also offering high prices to buy old and rotten fishing nets from our coastal fishing villages. Even rotten cotton quilts and old clothes are also bought. What their purpose is is unknown. It is heard that Japan has formed a joint fishing company, increasing its capital by 10 million yuan. In southern China, it has established a Penglai Fishing Company with Hong Kong as its center. The capital of 400,000 yuan ten years ago has now been expanded to more than 1 million yuan. It can be seen that the Japanese fishing industry has already dominated the South China market. If our country does not take measures to protect the fishing industry and abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes, I am afraid that the coastal fishing grounds of Fujian and Guangdong will all fall into the hands of Japanese fishermen.</p>
<p>In the Chao-Shan area, there are occasional reports of the fishing industry being harassed by taxes. Let me cite one recently occurred fact as an example. It is reported that the Wuhua Fellow Association in Chao-Shan reported that its member Li Yongqing stated that he made a living by driving boats and traveling to various places upstream of Chao-Shan. Yesterday, he received a basket of fish sauce from Shantou, totaling 60 small jars, and asked him to deliver it to the Chaosheng Fuzhan in Chao'an. He had already obtained a license in Shantou and paid the taxes. The Yu Shui Juan Dayi Company issued a transportation license (stating) that the goods should be unloaded in the county. Unexpectedly, when the boat stopped on the Xiangzi Rock River, several Yu Shui Juan inspectors suddenly arrived, making a big commotion and inspecting the boat. Then, because their request for an exemption from the inspection fee was not granted, they said that there was a suspicion of smuggling and forcibly moved the 60 jars of fish sauce to a small boat, claiming that a fine of 10 yuan was required. Otherwise, the fish sauce would be confiscated, and the ship was prevented from sailing. He earnestly requested that the matter be negotiated and the ship be released to avoid delaying time. After receiving the report, the association immediately sent Li Junfang to question them. According to Huang Shaoqing of the company, at least 5 yuan was required to release the ship. When asked if there were any punishment regulations, he remained silent. He only showed an old notice from a few years ago for inspection. The association's negotiator felt that the Yu Shui Juan Company dared to extort merchants in the same Chao'an area under the banner of the Qing Tian Bai Ri, which seemed inappropriate. He immediately reported to the Public Security Branch of the county seat and sent police to negotiate together. Only then was the ship released and the receipt for the stolen fish sauce was retrieved. The association decided to report the previous situation to the relevant authorities and ask them to stop the malpractices of extortion, etc., which have been strictly prohibited by the government.</p>
<h3>Song Yuanyuan Talks About National Defense in Fujian Province - Advocates Organizing Baojia and Popularizing Military Training</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Song Yuanyuan, Chairman of the Fujian Fellow Association in Shanghai, recently returned to Fujian Province to visit relatives and expressed his views on the current situation, saying, "Recently, the diplomatic situation has been tense. Our coastal area of southeastern Fujian stretches for more than a thousand miles, so we cannot avoid the so-called national defense issue that lingers in the minds of our Fujian people. Since Yuanyuan returned to Fujian, I have heard that the elders of my hometown are deeply worried about this. Some are paying more attention to it from a positive perspective, thinking about how our Fujian people should support the government in consolidating national defense. Yuanyuan has studied this in detail and believes that there is tangible national defense and intangible national defense. For example, deploying a certain amount of military force on the border and equipping it with appropriate defensive fortifications is tangible national defense. As for strengthening the people's strength and uniting the people's hearts as a backing for the government, this is called intangible national defense, which can also be called spiritual national defense. In recent years, the central government has attached great importance to promoting Baojia and conscript training. If our Fujian can do these two things earnestly, so that all the conscripts in the province can receive military-national education, then the people's strength will be strengthened, and the Baojia chiefs will also be trained, so that they know the strength to organize them. No matter how strong the enemy's armor and weapons are, they can only be defeated but not destroyed, and they can only occupy their land but not easily rule their people. Sun Tzu's Art of War says that attacking the mind is the best strategy. Mencius said that the best timing is not as good as the terrain, and the terrain is not as good as the people's harmony. This is the meaning. Therefore, when studying the national defense problem of our Fujian at present, regardless of whether the southeast coast is very long, regardless of how the government arranges along the coast, and regardless of whether the invading army arrives in the morning and can arrive in the evening, we must first awaken the people of the province to pay attention to the implementation of Baojia and social military training, so as to strengthen the intangible national defense, which is more important than supporting the government with any material strength. Yuanyuan has been away from Fujian for a long time and does not know how the Baojia is being handled in the various counties. Regarding social military training, it has been learned that military training officers have been dispatched to all 60-odd counties in the province. This is indeed a good phenomenon, and I hope that the people of Fujian will unanimously support and promote it," and so on.</p>
<h3>Taicang - Four Bridges Destroyed Overnight</h3>
<p>Four bridges on the Sha-Huang Road from Shatou to Huangjing in this county were suddenly demolished overnight. The stone bridges were moved without a trace, and the wooden bridge surfaces were burned. The cause of the fire seemed to be from bottom to top. Because they were destroyed at the same time, it was said that there was a special effect. Lu Qiao, the head of the Xiangxiang Township, has reported to Zheng Fengshi, the head of the Fifth District, and Chen Haoru, the patrol officer of the Public Security Bureau, has been accompanied to investigate.</p>
<h3>Nanhui - Brothers Robbed Miserably by Thieves</h3>
<p>Zhang Shunquan and Zhang Yexiao, farmers in Xinhua Township, Second District, live separately in east and west houses. Seven or eight bandits suddenly came the night before, speaking local and Chongming dialects, and wielding iron rulers and other weapons. First, they robbed Jin Jinlin, a tailor who was staying at Yexiao's house, tied him with lead wire, and hung him up with hemp rope to force him to reveal where he had hidden his silver. After thoroughly robbing him, they went to Shunquan's house and tied up his daughters, Ah San and Ah Si, and hung them up and beat them. They poured kerosene on their lower bodies and searched extensively. After more than an hour, they took the stolen goods and fled east.</p>
<h3>Kunshan - Autumn Harvest Assessment Finalized for the Entire County</h3>
<p>The autumn harvest in Kunshan this year has been finalized by the provincial authorities as a full collection of the full amount, and the county has been ordered to comply. However, the district heads, because the late rice harvest in the county was poor, jointly telegraphed to request a reduction, but were not granted it. It is now learned that the county government has forwarded the order after receiving it and immediately issued a notice to collect according to the amount.</p>
<h3>Each Township Joyfully Receives Timely Rain</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, it had not rained for nearly three months in this county. The fields were cracked, and vegetable prices had also risen accordingly. The farmers were extremely worried. Fortunately, there was a light rain a few days ago. Although the amount of water was very small, the fields in the four townships have shown signs of moisture, and winter crops can be sown immediately. The villagers have turned their worries into joy, and the prices of vegetables in the market have gradually returned to their old prices, benefiting the poor a lot.</p>
<h3>Suzhou - Strict Protection of the Grain Opening Season</h3>
<p>The various field-owning businesses in Wu County are preparing to open their warehouses to collect rent and have made preparations. It has been decided that they will open the warehouses today (the 11th) to start collecting rent within the time limit. The price of rent grain has been set by the party and government authorities at 7 yuan and 1 jiao. The quality of the rent grain will be reduced by 25% across the board, with 75% actually collected. For the disaster-stricken areas such as Chefang, the regulations will be reduced by another 50% to show sympathy for the farmers. This year, due to the bumper autumn harvest, the results of rent collection are expected to be good. The public security authorities, in view of the fact that farmers from various townships will be carrying money to Suzhou to pay the rent during the opening season, specially ordered the detective team and various branch bureaus on the 10th to strictly protect the farmers who are paying the rent. As for the quality of the land tax, the provincial authorities said that because of this year's bumper harvest, although Wu County has suffered some disasters, the total amount is less than 1%, so the full amount must still be collected.</p>
<h3>Major Fire on Changma Road Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>At 9 am on the 10th, firefighters from the fire brigades of various districts in Suzhou City gathered at the old Wutuan drill ground outside the Chang Gate, where the military officers held a review, preparing to conduct a fire drill in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, a fire broke out suddenly at the Shilu intersection outside the Chang Gate at 1:30 pm. The fire was quite fierce, and the area was the busiest district of the Liumen Road. Therefore, the firefighters who were preparing for the drill at the scene immediately drove to fight the fire. The fire was finally extinguished at about 3 pm. It is estimated that the Dahua Hat Shop, the Times Photo Studio, and the Wang Wantai Money Shop were destroyed, and the Fred Electric Materials Store and the Yichangfu Restaurant and other five or six shops were affected, with losses of no less than 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. The fire started at the Dahua Hat Shop.</p>
<h3>Changshu - Malaria Epidemic Spreads Throughout the County</h3>
<p>Malaria is prevalent here this autumn. It initially started in a corner of the fifth and sixth districts of the eastern township. Deaths followed one after another. In total, more than a thousand people have died within a month, which is alarming. Therefore, the anti-malaria team organized by the Red Cross and various Western doctors decided to go to the countryside to work in four groups. According to the investigation, the situation is still very fierce, and it is now spreading to the northwest township. There are also many deaths. The Red Cross has decided to do its best to save lives and has added more doctors to go to Xiejiaqiao in the northern township and Dahe in the western township to implement anti-malaria measures.</p>
<h3>Changzhou - Reconstruction of Three Bridges Planned in the North of the City</h3>
<p>The Qingshan Bridge, the Suspension Bridge, and the Yin Jia Bridge outside the North Gate of Wuyi County are all old stone-step bridges. They have been in disrepair for a long time, which is extremely inconvenient for traffic. The people there have formed a Bridge Construction Committee in the north of the city to discuss the reconstruction matters. They convened a meeting on the 9th, estimating that the construction of the three bridges would require 5,000 yuan. In addition to the approximately 2,500 yuan that has already been identified, there is still a shortage of 2,500 yuan. They plan to actively raise enough money from all parties and first reconstruct the Yin Jia Bridge this year. The other two bridges will be started as soon as the street widening plan is finalized.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang - Organizing the Yangqing Highway</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration believes that the Yangqing Highway is narrow, and the embankment along the canal is very dangerous. It ordered the relevant counties to recruit workers to rush to repair it. However, the road is completely dirt, and it cannot be used for traffic after rain. After the weather clears, although the road surface is dry and can be used for traffic, it is only limited to the road surface outside the streets. The road surface through the streets is still muddy, making it difficult to travel. The office specially sent Zhu Shizhen, the head of the highway section, to investigate. The road surface passing through the streets will be converted into a gravel road surface, and dangerous areas will be widened as much as possible to strengthen the road surface and facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou - Suspicious Person Found Outside the West Gate</h3>
<p>Two suspicious teenagers were found outside the earthwork project office, which had been completed, outside the West Gate of Yangzhou City on the 9th and were sent to the Public Security Bureau. It is heard that the teenagers strongly wanted to enter the site to visit and refused to obey the guards' prohibition. After being questioned, they ran away. They were stopped after three shots were fired. A foreign coin and a film were found in their possession, which were considered suspicious. However, it is heard that the Public Security Bureau investigated that the coin had indeed been rubbed and had no edges, and the film was not very relevant. Now their family members have asked the Baojia chief to present the case to the bureau for bail. The bureau has asked the county government to review and decide.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou - Egg Prices Soar Unceasingly</h3>
<p>The eggs in this county have always been transported to Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and other places by various egg shops. Recently, due to a sharp decrease in production and strong sales, prices have soared. On the 6th, it had risen to 20 yuan per 100 catties (market weight). Unexpectedly, it has soared again in the past two days. On the 8th, every 100 catties reached 22 yuan and 4 jiao, and there is still a continued upward trend. Salted eggs cost 24 yuan and 5 jiao per hundred, which is not much different from eggs, which is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Ningbo - Unscrupulous Merchants Ship Rice Overseas</h3>
<p>Since the Xiang County Government issued a provincial order prohibiting the export of rice overseas, it has repeatedly emphasized it. Unexpectedly, unscrupulous merchants Shi Abin, Zhang Caide, Zhang Ahong, and others colluded with a foreign rice merchant, taking advantage of official operations for private gain, and shipped rice overseas. The amount shipped per day was as high as 1,000 shi, which led to a sharp rise in rice prices in the Xiang area, and the poor people complained endlessly. The authorities are now investigating and cracking down on it.</p>

<h3>Silver Price Suddenly High; Equalization Tax Increased Yesterday; Up 6 Percent From the Previous Day; Exchange Rates Remain Very Stable</h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, jointly formed by the Central, China, and Jiaotong Banks, increased the equalization tax rate for preventing silver exports to 15.6% yesterday morning due to the sudden increase in the price of silver in London. This is up 6% from the previous day's 9.5%. Since the beginning of autumn this year, the average daily equalization tax levied in August, September, and October has been around 5-6%. The reason for the rapid increase is still the continued demand from London after the United States purchased silver. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, recent silver exports have all been legitimate international trade, and there have been few instances of remittances. There have been no private smuggling or profit-seeking cases of silver transportation.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Prices Rise</p>
<p>The Central Bank also made slight changes to its listed prices yesterday. The spot and forward prices of London large silver bars were both 21 and 7/8 pence, and the price in New York was 47.5 US dollars (previously they were around 19 pence and 45 US dollars respectively). The Shanghai standard gold price was 1,160 yuan and 5 jiao, up 10 yuan and 7 jiao from the previous day's 1,149 yuan and 8 jiao. The customs gold price was 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 0 li and 2 hao per yuan, equivalent to 33 pence 375, or 67 cents 8125 US dollars.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Stable</p>
<p>As for the exchange rates of foreign currencies such as British, American, French, German, and Japanese, the Central Bank consistently maintained its unchanged policy. Therefore, although the prices of gold and silver abroad have changed, the exchange rate has remained stable. Yesterday's listed prices were 1 shilling and 2.5 pence per national currency yuan in London, 30 US dollars in the United States, 630 francs in Paris, 73.5 marks in Berlin, and 103 yuan in Japan. Hong Kong was 97 yuan. The above are all the converted amounts per 100 national currency yuan.</p>
<h3>This City Commences Expanded Anti-Drug Propaganda Campaign Yesterday; All Relevant City Departments Mobilized; City Party Headquarters Issues Key Points of Anti-Drug Propaganda</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, various departments of the city, including the City Party Headquarters, the Garrison Command, the City Anti-Smoking Committee, and the City Public Security Bureau, are jointly launching an expanded anti-drug publicity campaign, which officially began yesterday, as the two-year drug prohibition period stipulated by the central government is about to expire. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Commencement of Mobilization</p>
<p>This campaign aims to awaken the grassroots masses to unanimously reject drugs and emphasizes in-depth oral propaganda among the grassroots. Yesterday was the first day of the city's expanded anti-drug propaganda campaign. The City Anti-Smoking Committee dispatched personnel to form a propaganda team with anti-smoking investigators from the Public Security Bureau, which set out to conduct propaganda in factories and shantytowns in the city. They also distributed easy-to-understand pictures and texts. Dai Lizhen, the section chief of the Fourth Section of the Public Security Bureau, spent the entire day going to various sub-bureaus, convening police chiefs for instructions and guidance. They immediately organized propaganda teams to set out in groups to conduct propaganda in their respective jurisdictions. At the same time, they also carried out the work of investigating and arresting opium smokers. The City Party Headquarters also ordered all district party headquarters to organize propaganda teams separately, set out to give speeches and propaganda in various public places. For the sake of widespread propaganda, famous people will be invited to go to the radio station to give broadcast speeches.</p>
<p>Key Points of Propaganda</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters issued the following key points of anti-drug propaganda yesterday: (1) The two-year drug prohibition period is about to expire. From 1937 onwards, anyone found to be using drugs or trafficking and manufacturing them, whether they are first-time offenders or have been registered, will be punished with the death penalty for violating the law. (2) Most drug users in this city are coolies and ignorant people who usually regard government laws and regulations as mere formalities. The longer they smoke, the deeper their addiction becomes. They do not know that the government's laws are strict and will never be lenient. It is hoped that drug users will automatically quit and turn back from the brink as soon as possible. Now is the time. (3) After quitting drugs, not only will individuals save unnecessary expenses and restore their health, but also their future will be stimulated with new vitality. This is of great benefit to society and the country. Therefore, whether for one's own life and future or for the benefit of society and the country, automatic abstinence is a matter of utmost urgency. (4) The penalties for trafficking and manufacturing drugs are much more severe than those for smoking. Those who have committed many evils will eventually be brought to justice. However, those who traffic and manufacture drugs, if they can repent of their past mistakes, change to a legitimate business, be law-abiding, and abide by the law, the law will not punish the past, and their life safety will be further protected.</p>
<p>Letter to the Citizens</p>
<p>"Citizens, the deadline for the absolute prohibition of highly addictive drugs is set for two years, from 1935 to the end of 1936. Now there are only a little over a month left before the deadline, which will pass quickly. Once it reaches 1937, all those who manufacture, transport, sell, and use red pills, heroin, morphine, and all other highly addictive drugs will be sentenced to death according to military law upon discovery. It is hoped that drug users will quickly quit on their own this year, and those who manufacture and transport drugs must change their professions as soon as possible and not seek their own death. Registration for opium smokers has now ended. All opium smokers who have failed to register can only surrender themselves for treatment to avoid punishment. The third-term opium smoking permits will be exchanged from October 16th of this year to the end of November. All opium smokers who have previously registered and obtained permits are urged to register and exchange their permits with the original permit-issuing agency as soon as possible. After the deadline, all old permits will be invalidated. Upon discovery, they will be punished in the same way as opium smokers who smoke without a permit." Respectfully announced by the City Anti-Smoking Committee and the City Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Slogans</p>
<p>Yesterday, various propaganda teams posted various warning pictures and slogans on major thoroughfares, such as "(1) People who use highly addictive drugs should quit voluntarily as soon as possible, otherwise, in 1937, there will only be one way to go: death. (2) Losing one's life for using highly addictive drugs is the most unworthy sacrifice in the world. (3) From 1937 onwards, the government will impose the death penalty on all users of highly addictive drugs. We hope everyone quits quickly. (4) People who use highly addictive drugs should quit voluntarily as soon as possible and become good citizens again," etc.</p>
<h3>French Concession Revises Census Count</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council is conducting a census of the residents of this concession. Following past practice, the police from each responsible precinct are dispatching officers to deliver census forms to each household. The homeowner is required to fill out the form in detail and return it to the police the following day. Starting from the 3rd of this month, the police from each precinct have been dispatching officers in groups to deliver forms to each household. This preliminary work has now been completed. To ensure accuracy, starting yesterday, each precinct is dispatching Western police officers to re-check the forms in conjunction with Chinese police officers, three officers in each team, to each road and alley. The homeowner is still required to fill in the number of people on the investigation form, sign or affix their seal, and check for any errors to ensure accuracy.</p>
<h3>National Government Awards Commendations to Gu Xinyi and Others</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association completed its operations, regarding the fundraising and donation organizations or individuals, it had previously requested the Disaster Relief Committee to work with the Ministry of Interior in September of this year to request the National Government to grant awards. It is now learned that the association was awarded five special-class gold commendations and five certificates by the Disaster Relief Committee yesterday, which will be awarded to Yao Mulian, Gu Xinyi, Liu Huhan, Liu Jingde, and Zhou Xiangyun, who raised more than 10,000 yuan each.

<h3>Japanese Mill Labor Strike Expands; Dakang and Other Mills Join the Strike; Disturbances Occurred Last Night, Two Workers Arrested; Labor Side Enlarges Petition, Party and Government Investigate the Truth; Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Mill Also Engaged in Go-Slow Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, all workers in seven Japanese-owned yarn mills in the Hudong District, including Shanghai, Tongxing, and Donghua, are continuing their strike. Yesterday, all workers at Shanghai No. 6 Mill on Linqing Road and Dakang Yarn Mill on Tengyue Road joined the strike, and clashes occurred with detectives. Party and government agencies dispatched personnel to investigate and confirm the truth. All workers decided to send representatives to hold an expanded petition. Japanese mills that have not gone on strike, such as Gongda, are actively recruiting new workers. A go-slow occurred at the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company owned by Chinese businessmen in Gao Langqiao. The Dagong News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Mill Labor Strike</p>
<p>Two Mills Respond</p>
<p>After all of the more than fifteen thousand male and female workers in seven factories – Japanese-owned Shanghai Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mills, Tongxing No. 2 mill, and Donghua – went on a joint strike, the workers’ foremen in each department and class discussed the situation with the factory. Because the factory could not agree to the five demands, all the workers continued their strike yesterday. More than 800 male and female workers at Shanghai No. 6 Mill on Linqing Road, Pingliang Road, also went on strike starting at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 4,000 male and female workers at the Dakang Yarn Mill on Tengyue Road, Yangshupu Road, also joined the strike at 5:30 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Disturbances Occur</p>
<p>At 6:00 p.m. yesterday, during the shift change at Dakang Yarn Mill, more than 5,000 male and female workers from Shanghai Nos. 1, 2, and 3 mills formed groups and mixed into the Dakang Yarn Mill to dissuade workers from going to work. After hearing about this, the Yulin Road Police Station and the Gelan Road Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives, red police cars, motorcycle squads, and Japanese Marine Corps soldiers to suppress the situation. At the time, the crowd was huge, and the situation was serious. Suddenly, someone threw a stone and broke the head of a Western detective, causing temporary chaos. Two workers were arrested on the spot, and the workers were dispersed, and the situation gradually subsided.</p>
<p>Party and Government Investigation</p>
<p>The municipal government authorities are quite concerned about this strike at the Japanese-owned Shanghai yarn mills and other mills and hope that the labor and management sides will engage in negotiations to resolve the situation as soon as possible. Zhang Chuqiang and Bao Boyi of the City Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs went to various Japanese-owned yarn mills such as Pingliang Road and Yangshupu Road yesterday to investigate the truth of the workers' strike and then discuss appropriate measures to carry out mediation to avoid the expansion of the crisis.</p>
<p>Expanded Petition</p>
<p>Representatives of the striking workers of the Japanese-owned yarn mills held a meeting at a certain location in Hongkou District at 3:15 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The content of the meeting is unknown, but according to the Dagong News Agency reporter, who obtained reliable information from all parties, the workers believe that the factory has no sincerity in accepting the conditions. Therefore, each factory has sent representatives to the City Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to hold an expanded petition within days, and in the name of the joint representatives of the workers of the Japanese-owned yarn mills, they have called on all sectors of the city to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Each Mill Recruits Workers</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned yarn mills and the British-owned Ewo Cotton Mill, which have not been involved in the strike vortex – Gongda, Dakang, Yufeng on Yangshupu Road, and Nei Wai Cotton, Toyota, Kiwa, Tongxing No. 1 mill, and Rihua in the West Shanghai District – have posted notices everywhere to recruit hundreds of skilled male and female workers for warp yarn and fine yarn. The Chinese-owned Shenxin mills, Wing On, Hongzhang, and Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing, and other mills are also actively recruiting new workers.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening and closing yarn prices on the yarn and cloth exchange market were very stable. In fact, all periods returned a small two to three corners. The flower cloth market price, due to the congestion of spot goods and the suspension of orders from the striking mills after the Japanese-owned yarn mills went on strike, caused the flower price to fall by three to three and a half corners per load. Yesterday, Rong Zongjing, a leader in the yarn mill industry, told the Dagong News Agency reporter who visited that the market yarn price was very stable because our Chinese-owned mills, in order to uphold commercial ethics, did not raise the market price due to the strike of the Japanese-owned yarn mills.</p>
<p>Tsuneji Expresses</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reporter went to the fourth floor of the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund at around 11:00 a.m. yesterday to meet Tsuneji, the chairman of the Japanese Textile Industry Federation in China, to inquire about the attitude that the federation should take after the strike of the Shanghai yarn mills and other mills, and the ways to resolve it. Nanjyuu San received the reporter and said that he represents Tsuneji in expressing his views. The five demands made by the workers to the factory in this strike are similar to leaflet declarations and cannot be regarded as formal conditions. Therefore, the federation convened the heads of various factories yesterday to discuss the situation for the purpose of exchanging views only, and there was no concrete decision. The federation is observing the development of the situation on the one hand and notifying the factories to seek a solution through amicable consultation with the labor side. The federation will devise appropriate measures to protect the interests of the industry and to eliminate the crisis as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Labor Side Attitude</p>
<p>According to the attitude of the striking workers, the painful situation of the workers has been explained in detail in the joint statement to the Japanese-owned yarn mills. This strike was really out of compulsion. Just considering the wages, the wages for weaving four machines in the weaving mill used to be eighteen to nineteen yuan per period, but now the wages for weaving four machines are only eight to nine yuan per period. The wage for spinning eighty wooden rods of fine yarn used to be nine yuan, but now the wage for spinning ninety-six rods is still nine yuan. The wage for spinning sixty cars of yarn used to be eight to nine yuan per period, but now the wage for spinning more than one hundred cars has been reduced to seven to eight yuan. Not only is there no rest every day, but the machine is still running during meal times, and life is like that of cattle and horses. In order to improve their livelihood, the workers have put forward five demands, which are all legitimate. They will not resume work until the goals are achieved. We hope that all sectors will have compassion for the suffering of the workers and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Situation of Chinese-Owned Yarn Mills</p>
<p>Shenxin No. 5 Mill Starts Work</p>
<p>After the Shenxin Textile Company entrusted the management of its Second Mill on Yichang Road and Fifth Mill on Huade Road to the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai, a management committee was established to prepare for the start of work. As of yesterday, the yarn spindles of the Second Mill have been fully started, and the Fifth Mill also started work yesterday. The cleaning and steel wire sections started work first, and the coarse yarn section is scheduled to start work today.</p>
<p>Disputes in Mills No. 1 and No. 8</p>
<p>The Shenxin No. 1 and No. 8 mills in Zhoupu Town, West Shanghai, are quite large in scale. Due to the sluggish yarn industry in the past, the mills were forced to reduce work and deduct wages to maintain operations. This year, yarn sales are booming and business is extremely developed. Therefore, the workers requested to restore the original wages to improve their lives. The Cotton Spinning Industry Association of the Tenth District submitted a request to the party and government authorities for review. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the Third Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs convened a mediation meeting, and labor and management representatives conducted mediation. After Chairman Zhu Jintao announced the purpose of the mediation, the labor and management representatives stated their reasons. Because the two sides could not agree, the mediation did not achieve results. The chairman announced that the mediation would continue today.</p>
<p>Printing and Dyeing Mill Goes on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>More than 120 female workers in the spinning room of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Textile Factory at 1382 Huade Road, Hudong, currently earn 3.8 corners per day. Because the yarn industry has improved, they have requested the factory to increase their wages by 9 corners per day, totaling 4.7 corners per worker, but the factory has not allowed it. Therefore, they went on a go-slow starting at 6:00 a.m. yesterday. The police station in charge, after hearing about the situation, sent detectives to suppress the situation, and the order was very good. It is learned that the factory will directly negotiate with the three parties and will allow the wage increase. Work was resumed before noon.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association Scheduled to Hold General Meeting</h3>
<p>Re-elect Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The term of office of the first board of directors and supervisors of the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has expired. At the recent standing committee meeting, it was decided to hold the second member general meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Auditorium on Yu Qiaqing Road at 1:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Assassination Attempt at Wu Yuguo's Home in Yangjiadu</h3>
<p>Cries for Help, Two Shots Fired; Four Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>Jiangbei resident Wu Yuguo, who lives in the back grass shed at No. 126 Fukang Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, was suddenly attacked by five thugs at 3:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. Two of them were on the lookout outside, and three of them entered the house. First, they used an electric torch to illuminate the house and warned Wu not to make a sound. Then, they broke into the room, opened the quilt, and searched for Wu's adopted son, Little Hongzi, without success. They stole Wu's flashlight and 400 copper coins and fled. Wu cried for help and was shot twice, but fortunately, he was not hit. Wu's neighbor, Li Xiaoer, opened the door to investigate and was injured in the left arm by the thugs with an iron bar. Afterwards, Wu rushed to report to the Yangjiadu Police Station. Chief Yang immediately sent patrol leader Dai Guanqing and detective Cui Youkuan to arrest the suspects. Yesterday, in the South Caonitang, they arrested Zhang Xiaolong, a Gaoyou native who fired the shots (nicknamed Little Stupid), and suspects Zhang Xiaoliuzi, Ding Wannian, and Jiang Junkui, and recovered a bullet casing at the scene. They were taken to the station and, after being interrogated by Chief Yang, it was determined that the case involved attempted assassination with a gun and opportunistic robbery. In addition to ordering the arrest of the instigator who was at large, Zhang and the other three were transferred to the General Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>A Bomb Explodes in a Pile of Scrap Iron</h3>
<p>Yang San's Right Hand Blown Off</p>
<p>At 2:20 p.m. last night, at the Huaxing Scrap Copper and Iron Factory at No. 560 Fangbang Road, Nanshi, Yang San, a 43-year-old Jiangbei native and an employee of the factory, was picking up copper and iron when a bomb exploded in a pile of scrap iron, completely blowing off Yang San's right hand. He was later taken to the hospital for treatment by his colleagues.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed and Conspiracy Case: First Special Court Trial; Jiang Zhonghe and Ren Jinpin; Police Lawyer Testifies About Defendant's Crimes; Jiang and Ren Claim They Were Framed Due to Mediation of Conflicts</h3>
<p>—Ren Jinpin Will Submit a Petition to Apply for Bail—</p>
<p>Jiang Zhonghe, manager of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory and concurrently manager of the Shanghai West Fight National Goods Company, and Ren Jinpin, secretary of the fish market, were both accused of participating in the illegal activities of the Bloodshed and Conspiracy Group, organized by Zhang Zilian of the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory, which specialized in throwing bombs at merchants selling Japanese goods to extort money. After the First Special District Court sentenced several members of the arrested group, warrants were issued for their arrest. On the evening of the second of this month, Jiang went to the North Railway Station, intending to take a train back to his hometown of Changzhou. He was intercepted by Detective Yun Agen and Detective Lang Jintang. On the fifth, Ren Jinpin surrendered to the</p>
<p>police station. They were subsequently brought to the First Special Court for investigation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. According to the investigating detectives, from August of the 21st year to August of the 23rd year, the Nanjing Road Sino-American Watch Company, Minghua Silk Store, Nanjing Road Yuxingli Huayang Laundry Company, Ningbo Road Dajing Printing House, Fujian Road Rongchangxiang Watch Store, Deng Zhongxing Hardware Store, Guangxi Road Senchang General Association, Binlang Road Gongzu Socks Factory, Jiangxi Road Peichang Iron Factory, Taiwan Road Yitai Department Store, and No. 43 Wuxi Road, among others, were successively attacked or had</p>
<p>bombs left at their premises. All of this was allegedly instigated by Jiang, Ren, and the fugitive Zhang Zilian. They were charged with public endangerment and obstruction of freedom. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide specially opened the First Criminal Court and ordered Jiang and Ren, the two defendants, to be brought in for interrogation. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that eight people, including Wang Zixiang, had already been sentenced, seven of whom were serving their sentences. For the sake of procedural convenience, the two defendants in this case were listed as the ninth and tenth defendants. However, after the seven who had been sentenced were taken by the French police for investigation, they were prosecuted in the Second Special Court, but the trial concluded that the crimes they committed in the French Concession were the same as those committed in the Public Concession. The Second Special Court considered their crimes to be continuous. Having already been sentenced by your honorable court, they were not prosecuted again. Furthermore, Wang Tiemin, the sixth defendant among them, was taken away by the Garrison Headquarters and has not been returned, so his sentence has not yet been executed. He requested that the Headquarters be urged to expedite Wang's return. In addition, Zhang Zilian, Wang Zixiang, and others are still at large. According to the confessions of Wang Tiemin and others, the purpose of their organized conspiracy group was to boycott Japanese goods. Therefore, some of their members were arrested and sentenced for violating criminal laws, but the outside world sympathized with them as a patriotic act. Now, the truth is revealed: they were</p>
<p>using patriotism as a pretext to extort money. Their confessions clearly reveal the organization's content. Zhang Zilian was the leader of the group, Jiang Zhonghe was responsible for investigation, Ren Jinpin served as the general secretary, Wang Zixiang also served as secretary, and the rest were investigators. If a store selling Japanese goods was found, it was reported to the leader first to be notified. If they complied, a small price was extorted; otherwise, a bomb would follow. Before throwing bombs, they gathered at Zhang's house at No. 15 Yuxingli. Wang Tiemin supplied the bombs and distributed them to those who had already been</p>
<p>convicted, who went to the addresses to throw or leave them. It is a pity that Wang Tiemin has not been sent to court, making it difficult to proceed with the investigation, he said. Jiang Zhonghe's defense lawyer, Wu Lin Kun, defended Jiang, stating that Jiang had no involvement in this case and was being falsely accused by Wang and others. He also requested that Jiang be allowed to obtain a chain of guarantees and be released, he said. When questioned, Jiang denied participating in the conspiracy group, stating that Wang Tiemin led five people to Zhang's house on July 28 to ask Zhang for food. Zhang was out, so Wang asked me to pass on the message. Later, these people went to the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory to ask Zhang for money, and I had a conflict with them. Therefore, they</p>
<p>resented and falsely accused me, he said. Ren Jinpin also stated that Wang and others asked Zhang for money. Because I knew Wang, I came out to mediate. Later, Wang was arrested in the room I was concerned with in the Dongfang Hotel. He suspected that I had colluded with Zhang and therefore falsely accused me, she said. She also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping and requested that she be allowed to post bail. Lawyer Jiang said that Ren surrendered herself, which is different from being arrested. Moreover, all the evidence in this case is in the official authorities. If Ren is released on bail, there is no risk of destroying evidence. If self-surrender is treated the same as being arrested, it would defeat the purpose of encouraging self-surrender, he said. Judge Feng instructed her to submit a formal application regarding the bail point and then review and decide. Subsequently, he instructed the defendants to be returned to custody and wait for the case files to be collected and a date to be set for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Cao Hang Town: Bandits Rob Convent; More Than 20 Bandits Open Fire to Resist Arrest; Police Bravely Capture One Bandit</h3>
<p>In the Xilongli Convent in Cao Hang Town, Second District of Shanghai County, lived a nun named Shi Gui Fang. Her daily life was frugal, and she had accumulated some savings. At around 11 PM the night before last, more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived, speaking with accents from another region. They carried pistols, flashlights, ropes, and other items. They broke into the convent to rob it. They first tied up the abbess, Shi Gui Fang, with ropes, poured kerosene into her mouth, and beat her with fists and feet, demanding money. The nun refused to speak. They then ransacked the convent, stealing several thousand copper coins, as well as cotton quilts, clothes, and other items. At the time, Patrol Officer Yang Hui of the Cao Hang Substation, along with police officers Li Shi Jin and others, were patrolling nearby. Hearing the bandit alarm, they immediately rushed to arrest them. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. Patrol Officer Yang and others retaliated while fighting bravely and rushing forward to seize them. Eventually, they captured one bandit and seized a pistol. At that time, the bandits, relying on their numbers, still tried to resist, attempting to snatch back the captured bandit. Patrol leaders and police officers from Guan Gang, Qianliang Temple, and other patrol posts of the Hua Jing Police Station rushed to respond upon hearing the news. The bandits then panicked and fled in all directions to the west. Patrol Officer Yang ordered the officers to take the captured bandit to the police station for strict custody. He then led the officers to track and pursue the bandits until they reached the border of Songjiang County. As it was late at night, fearing a misunderstanding with the military police of the neighboring county, they did not pursue them further, allowing them to escape. Afterwards, they returned to the convent and found a cotton quilt, a rope, a candle, a felt hat, and other items left behind by the bandits outside the rattan door. They took these items back to the Cao Hang Substation. They interrogated the captured bandit, who confessed to the name Li Hongsheng and admitted to the gang robbery, but refused to provide further details. Patrol Officer Yang prepared a document the next day to submit to the North Bridge County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Public Concession: Water Rates to Increase</h3>

<h3>Assassination of Shao Wenbin Case: Special Second Court Resumes Hearing Yesterday</h3>
<p>The late flower association tycoon Shao Wenbin, also known as Ah Liu the groom, originally worked as a Tanhua performer, later switching to running flower associations. Due to disputes over rights, he was assassinated on Huagene Road in the French Concession on the evening of July 28th of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. After his death, the French police arrested the suspect, Zhang Bingrong from Ningbo, nicknamed Little Ningbo, and handed him over to the court for prosecution. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is currently serving. During the arrest and investigation, Zhang confessed that he was instructed by the fugitive Wang Shilong to go with him to kill Shao. Wang fled upon hearing the news and was not apprehended until September 2nd of this year, when the French police, together with the Xinzha police, arrested Wang Shilong (41 years old, from Danyang) at No. 58, Lane 920, Xinzha Road. He was handed over to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. Wang also confessed that his accomplice, a local named Qian Ajin, also known as "Pockmarked" Qian Ajin (50 years old, residing at No. 70, Yongping Lane, Maigen Road), was also an instigator in Shao's murder. The detectives then arrested Qian and brought him to the Special Second Court. The police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution against them for murder and gambling. After repeated hearings by Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, and confrontation with Zhang Bingrong, the details of the unresolved case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wang, along with Prosecutor Wang Ren, resumed the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. After first summoning and questioning the witnesses, they questioned Wang and Qian, who still vehemently denied being the masterminds behind the murder of Shao Wenbin and claimed they did not know Cao Awu and others. The court deemed the case clear and ordered closing arguments. The police department's representative, lawyer Gu Shouxi, and the defendants' defense attorneys, Wu Kaisheng, Huang Xiubo, and Wang Shouan, then presented their arguments. After the arguments, the court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 17th. The defendants were remanded in custody. Qian Ajin's defense attorney requested bail, but the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's First Special District Court sent documents requesting Qian Ajin's presence for interrogation, so bail was denied. The bailiffs then took the two defendants back into custody.</p>
<h3>Shooting and Robbery Causing Injury in Xiaonanmen</h3>
<p>Xi Weiqi's Life in Danger</p>
<p>Xi Weiqi, a 40-year-old Ningbo native residing at No. 12, Lane 57, Sangyuan Street, Nanshi, works as a salesman at the Commercial Printing House on North Sichuan Road. Yesterday afternoon around 7:00 PM, Xi Weiqi took a deposit book to the Detai New Money Exchange at Gongjia Bridge, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, to withdraw over 20 national currency dollars. On his way home, as he passed Huangjia Zui in Xiaonanmen, he was suddenly confronted by three bandits who blocked his path. One bandit pulled out a pistol and ordered him to be silent. The bandits robbed him of over 20 national currency dollars and his deposit book. Xi Weiqi tried to snatch back the deposit book and resisted, angering the bandits. They shot him once in the right waist. The bullet did not pass through. Xi endured the pain and continued to resist. As the bandit threw the deposit book on the ground, Xi collapsed in agony, bleeding profusely. Nearby patrol officers heard the commotion and rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already fled without a trace. The injured Xi was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries are said to be severe and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers in Carjacking Case Returned for Trial</h3>
<p>Han Kesheng from Yangzhou, along with Wu Xiaotaozi and Wang A'er, who were being handled by the French Concession for another case in Kunshan County, were involved in a robbery case and fled to Shanghai. They were apprehended by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Zhabei. It was discovered that Han and Wu, on the morning of July 20th of this year at 9:45 AM, colluded with accomplices and used weapons to hijack a private car belonging to Dong Yunlong from Tongzhou, residing at No. 71, Jiaozhou Road. Inside the car was a leather suitcase containing various account books, totaling 2,015.16 dollars. They forced Dong and the driver out of the car and drove to the end of Jiaozhou Road. The driver was careless and the car crashed into a utility pole, damaging the engine. Seeing that there was no cash in the suitcase, they abandoned the car and fled. Therefore, detectives from Jiadian Road Police Station dispatched detectives Jin Yangwu to the French Concession and the Municipal Public Security Bureau to bring back Han Kesheng and Wu Xiaotaozi. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Labor Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and stated that the two defendants confessed at the police station. Then, the victim Dong Yunlong testified about the robbery, but he could not identify the two defendants' faces. When questioned, Han Kesheng confessed that Chen He and Gu San, who are still at large, initiated the plan, claiming that Dong's car's leather suitcase contained valuables. Wu Xiaotaozi, Zhang Xiao'erzi, Lu Kuaizi, and Dabing Siwu accompanied them. Wu Xiaotaozi confessed that he followed Chen He's instructions and went along to commit the robbery. Judge Zhong Qing ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for the 17th.</p>
<h3>Lovesick Man's Joke: A Promissory Note for 50,000 Dollars</h3>
<p>Lawsuit Rejected Due to Underage Plaintiff; Should File Complaint with the Prosecutor's Office and Post Bail</p>
<p>Li Mingde, son of Li Hongfa, a comprador for the Osaka Wharf of Mitsubishi Corporation and native of Ningbo, graduated from St. John's Middle School and is currently studying at Guanghua University. In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], he met Fan Meimei, a local dancing girl (now 19 years old), at a dance hall. He fell in love at first sight and they became intimate. Li claimed that he had no wife at home and promised to stay with her until they grew old together. Thus, on April 9th of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], they became intimate. By May of the 23rd year of the Republic, they began living together. They have since had two children, the older being two years old and the younger being one year old. In the 23rd year of the Republic, Li Mingde even wrote a promissory note stating that if he abandoned Fan Meimei, he would give her 50,000 dollars for living expenses. In July of this year, Li's wife, Li Cao Shi, suddenly sued Li Mingde and Fan Meimei in court for adultery. After mediation, Fan Meimei then hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Li Mingde of impairing public morals. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zongxing held a hearing. Fan Meimei, accompanied by her mother, Fan Chen Shi, appeared in court and stated that in the winter of the 22nd year, she met the defendant, who seduced her with sweet words and tricked her into having sexual relations. He falsely claimed that he was not married, so she mistakenly believed him and rented a house to live with him at No. 150, Beile Road in the French Concession. Only recently did she discover that the defendant had a wife. She argued that the defendant used deceptive means to seduce her and should be severely punished. At this point, the judge questioned Li Mingde, who stated that he was 30 years old, currently unemployed, and residing at No. 39, Dekang Lane, Qiujiang Road. He admitted to writing the promissory note, but claimed that they had a good relationship and that he wrote it as a joke. He said that she was suing him now simply to get him into trouble with the law. He also claimed that he still loved her and would never abandon her. He further stated that she was incited to sue him by her brother-in-law, and that he knew she loved him and would never sue him on her own accord. At this point, the judge ruled that the plaintiff was under the legal age of 20 and should have her guardian file a complaint with the prosecutor's office. The lawsuit was rejected. To prevent future difficulties with the prosecutor's office summoning and detaining him, the defendant was ordered to post bail.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>In the article "Labor Unrest at Six Silk Factories in Western Shanghai" published in your newspaper on the 10th of this month, it stated, "The former Baohua Silk Weaving Factory dismissed workers without cause, Factory Director Yu Cun violently beat workers, and all workers at the factory went on strike for one hour yesterday morning according to the agreed time." After investigation, the Baohua Factory previously reduced the number of machines due to poor business conditions and legally terminated a small number of workers with poorer performance after prior notice. How can it be said that they were dismissed without cause? At 5:30 PM on the 28th of last month, Qian Zhangfei and other unruly workers at the Yucun Factory colluded with hundreds of workers from other factories, creating a turbulent situation and assaulting the staff. Fortunately, the Public Security Bureau maintained order effectively and prevented a major disaster. Now it is falsely claimed that the factory director violently beat the workers, which is a complete distortion of the truth. As for the 9th of this month, our factory worked as usual throughout the day and there was no one-hour strike. Your newspaper's report is inaccurate and may mislead the public. Therefore, we hereby request a correction and hope that it will be published in the Letters to the Editor column to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Baohua Silk Weaving Company and Yucun Silk Weaving Co., Ltd.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the article in your newspaper on the 9th of this month concerning the shareholder lawsuit of Jinlong Cotton Weaving Factory, it states, "Yang Yisun works at China Oil Lamp Company and became acquainted with Wu Jiamo as colleagues." After investigation, Wu Jiamo has introduced customers to purchase our company's products several times, but he is not an employee of our company. As for Yang Yisun, he previously worked in our company's factory and left some time ago. We are deeply concerned that the outside world may misunderstand the true situation. Therefore, we request that you correct this as soon as possible. We would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Special Edition</p>
<h3>A Few Humble Contributions to the National Goods Movement</h3>
<p>— Ms. Qiao Jianhua</p>
<p>After reading the National Products Movement Federation's announcement to women regarding the promotion of home visits, I was sincerely moved. As the national crisis deepens, all of us women should rise up and work together to avert the crisis, fulfilling our duties as citizens. "Using national products" is even more the most sacred of our duties, and we cannot shirk our responsibilities. There is no need for mothers to wait for advice. However, unscrupulous merchants prioritize profits over righteousness, and foreign goods flood the market. Women are often short-sighted and easily deceived, leading to a situation where foreign goods dominate. Whenever I think of this, I feel deeply saddened. I now humbly offer a few suggestions for the consideration of the gentlemen of the National Products Movement Federation.</p>
<p>1. Each female visitor spends the whole day running around and calling out, and their lips are parched and tongue is dry. The effect they achieve must already be considerable, but I have heard that some families often dislike the inconvenience and refuse to meet with the visitors. In my humble opinion, when encountering this situation, the visitors must change their approach and start from the lower levels. When visiting a family, first hand the preferential coupons from various merchants to the servants, stating how much money can be saved by purchasing certain goods, and what kind of free gifts can be obtained. Instruct the servants to present them together with the visitor's business card and advocate for them (stating that no money will be taken and that it is not a fundraising activity, but only a request for a meeting). If they are accepted, it can serve as a stepping stone to gaining entry. When meeting them, the speech should be concise and clear, and avoid being long-winded.</p>
<p>2. In modern times, there is a trend of extravagance. Urban men often like to wear Western suits, and the choice of fabric for the suits mostly depends on the mistress of the house. We can discuss this with the Zhanghua and Haijing wool fabric factories, and have them print more 10% or 5% discount coupons (or other gift coupons, such as giving away daily necessities with the purchase of a suit), and send them together with the wool fabric samples to the mistress of the house (those who do not wear Western suits do not need to be sent). This is to spark their interest in wearing Western suits made of domestic wool fabric. At the same time, we should find ways to get Western clothing stores to stock more domestic wool fabric materials for selection. Those who bring preferential coupons when ordering custom-made clothes can enjoy the benefits as usual.</p>
<p>3. Please ask the mistresses of the house to keep the receipts of pure domestic products purchased from national goods companies or other national goods stores. If the amount reaches a certain amount of silver or more, they can enjoy certain benefits (please have the association plan the details of the method in advance before implementation).</p>
<p>4. Advise various manufacturers to strive for perfection in their products and not to use their habitual tricks of cutting corners and using inferior materials just because the goods are already selling well. For example, for ×× pencils, general students were satisfied with their use in the first semester of this year, but starting in the second semester, the wood strips and the lead were not as good as before (the wood is rough, and the lead is brittle), and students inevitably have a dislike for using them.</p>
<p>5. The work of female visitors does not seem to be limited to families. Sometimes they can go to various schools to advise the teachers in charge to instruct students to use domestic products both in and out of class. Students' patriotic sentiments are even more enthusiastic and can easily be effective. For example, when I teach at × school, I instill national consciousness and talk about ways to save the country anytime and anywhere. At a minimum, everyone must use domestic products, and the results are greatly moving. However, I asked the students if there were other teachers who also explained this in the same way, and after investigation, there were only a few. This shows that most of the teachers and staff have not paid attention to this, so the work of advising teachers and staff cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>How to Visit the National Products Exhibition?</h3>
<p>— Yao Chengxuan</p>
<p>(1) Observation: This is an unavoidable and common thing, that is, to open any exhibition, especially a national products exhibition, there are many people who come and go, so-called to "join the crowd and make a scene." Is "joining the crowd and making a scene" a desirable attitude? I think no matter who it is, they should criticize it. Opening a national products exhibition, its mission is so important! Its intention is so deep and painstaking! We don't even talk about national products exhibitions, even a very ordinary exhibition, we should have an attitude of observation. How much more so when it is not a joke! Therefore, if we have a clear mind and understand some worldly affairs, we all know that Chinese people are always sloppy and don't care everywhere. Looking at a national products exhibition, like a horse looking at flowers, there is no need for an attitude of observation. Everyone! This is an illusion, an absolutely bad mentality. I hope all my dear compatriots will bring up the spirit of observation, so that they can be worthy of visiting the national products exhibition! The national products exhibition will then have a relationship with you.</p>
<p>(2) Criticism: After observing something, a feeling arises in the heart. When we see the dazzling array of domestic products on display, we should have a fair and critical feeling. If we feel that our criticism is fair and correct, we may wish to contribute some opinions to the organization hosting the national products exhibition, or to newspapers, supplements, or other magazines and publications that publish about national products, so that the national products industry and the national products movement can continue to move forward. When Europeans and Americans look at an exhibition, they have very faithful instructions, which are provided to their country. This can also be said to be a duty that the people should have. It can also be seen from this point the differences in the patriotic feelings of the Eastern and Western countries and the level of high and low. We hope that the old and young, men and women, who come to visit will take on the responsibility of criticism and add glory to the future of national products. "The stones of other mountains can be used to cut jade." These are the words of the ancients, but are they not our golden words?</p>
<p>(3) Creation: The word "creation" seems to have nothing to do with visiting at first glance, but it is not. After visiting the national products exhibition, if we feel that a certain domestic product needs to be improved, and we feel that with my knowledge, ability, and technology, I can get rid of its outline and create a better domestic product, that would be the best thing. In recent years, because the people who research science are diligently engaged in creation, there are also many inventions, which is a very gratifying thing. I hope that people who come to visit the national products exhibition will use an attitude of observation and an attitude of correct criticism to obtain the beautiful fruit of creation. I believe that knowledgeable people will not consider my absurd views to be absurd, will they? The above three points are easily overlooked by visitors, so I suddenly put them forward as a reference for everyone when visiting the national products exhibition.</p>
<p>A Contribution</p>
<h3>Government Agencies and the Purchase of National Products</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the National Government passed a "Provisional Method for Government Agencies to Purchase National Products" with five articles at its 286th meeting on the 3rd. This is the most determined and effective action since the central government advocated national products, and it is one of the most noteworthy events in the history of promoting national products. The method is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Government agencies must give priority to purchasing national products for public use.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Industry will create a list of national products commonly used by various agencies and distribute it to the agencies for selection.</p>
<p>(3) For national products factories that have not been registered, the Ministry will order the local National Products Movement Federation to investigate and forward them for registration.</p>
<p>(4) If it is found that a product from a certain factory in a certain place is not a national product but is being sold as a national product, the agency will not be able to reimburse the loss of the cost of the items, and the merchant should be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>(5) For special items needed by various agencies, as well as items specially needed for academic experiments and technical work, if there is no national product to replace them and foreign products must be used, detailed reasons and facts should be stated.</p>
<p>If various agencies violate the above regulations, they will all be treated as uneconomical expenditures and will not be approved for reimbursement.</p>
<p>There are four things that we should pay attention to here:</p>
<p>First, the administrative staff of government agencies must give priority to purchasing national products for public use from now on. Using foreign products when national products are available was previously only considered unpatriotic and subject to the condemnation of conscience and moral sanctions. Since the central government promulgated this method, it is even more so considered uneconomical, illegal, and will not be approved for reimbursement. The administrative staff of government agencies must pay attention to this and not be negligent, so as not to bring trouble on themselves.</p>
<p>Second, in fact, giving priority to purchasing national products should not only be limited to government agencies. All industrial, commercial, educational institutions in the country, such as banks, companies, factories, and shops, as well as doctors, lawyers, accountants, and other freelancers, should also consider purchasing national products as their due responsibility.</p>
<p>Third, since the Ministry of Industry has created a list of national products and distributed it to various agencies for selection, the most important thing to pay attention to here is to strictly prevent non-national products from being disguised and mixed in. Currently, unscrupulous merchants in the market often use foreign products as national products to deceive users, so the items listed on the list should be absolutely strict. If there are any questionable products, it is better to have a shortage than to be indiscriminate. Otherwise, promoting national products will only open the door for unscrupulous merchants to profit. The National Products Federation and other organizations responsible for investigation must not be lenient or pervert justice.</p>
<p>Fourth, according to the fourth item of the method: "If it is found that a product from a certain factory is not a national product but is being sold as a national product, the agency will not be able to reimburse the loss of the cost of the items, and the merchant who sells it should be responsible for compensation." This point is extremely fair. In the future, merchants who sell goods must be cautious and strict in choosing between national products and non-national products. We believe that those who sell non-national products as national products should be published in newspapers and abandoned by the public. The business of such stores will naturally not be able to be maintained. Therefore, pure national products companies should be established everywhere under the guidance of the government to facilitate the use of various government agencies.</p>
<h3>National Products News in the Past Week</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the National Government resolved on the 2nd to implement seven articles of the Provisional Method for Government Agencies to Purchase National Products. In the future, if various agencies purchase public items and still use foreign products when national products are available, the Auditing Department will not approve the expenditure of funds.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Industry to quickly set up a unified national products company and sent Mr. Cheng Juemin to Shanghai to prepare.</p>
<p>The Women's Use of National Products Association is scheduled to hold its founding meeting today.</p>
<p>The National Handicraft and Arts Exhibition is scheduled to open in Nanjing on May 1st, 1937.</p>
<p>The Nanyang Business Observation Group has returned to China from Singapore via Saigon and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Education Order: How to Continue Using Old Elementary School Textbooks: Adjust, Delete, and Truthfully State to Avoid Review</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education previously reported that the Tongshan County Bureau of Education had reduced elementary school subject time and that using old textbooks made it difficult to meet the requirements. It requested instructions on how to remedy the situation. The department forwarded the request to the Ministry of Education for instructions. The department has now received instructions from the Ministry of Education: "It is understood that the use of old textbooks after the promulgation of the new curriculum standards is only a temporary transitional measure. When implementing teaching in each elementary school, the entire textbook material should be compared with the content of the new curriculum standards for each subject, and adjusted and deleted accordingly to remedy the situation. When supervisors and education commissioners inspect, the deletion situation should be truthfully stated so that they can avoid reviewing un taught classes. Immediately notify and inform." After receiving the order, the Jiangsu Education Department has ordered all county education bureaus in the province to refer to it.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yuanruo's Broadcasting Speech: "Supporting the Leader" and National Salvation Through Self-Reliance (1)</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau Broadcasting Station of the Ministry of Communications, in order to improve broadcasting programs and benefit social education, specially invited political theorist Zhang Lisheng, the founder of "Self-Reliance Doctrine," to broadcast a speech yesterday, titled "Supporting the Leader and National Salvation Through Self-Reliance." The words were alert and thought-provoking. The original manuscript has been obtained and is published in full:</p>
<p>1.  Microsigns of National Revival Recently, due to the attention and training of the government authorities and the enthusiastic calls of patriots from all walks of life, the people of our country have indeed made great progress. Chairman Lin of the National Government expressed his deep satisfaction in his speech in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The enthusiasm of the people of the country to purchase airplanes for the country in celebration of President Chiang's birthday is sufficient proof that the Chinese people's concept of the country has progressed (Note 1). This enthusiastic national sentiment and spiritual expression undoubtedly symbolize:</p>
<p>Our sluggish sleeping lion has already</p>
<p>begun to awaken.</p>
<p>Our scattered masses have already</p>
<p>a center.</p>
<p>Our dying national fortune has already</p>
<p>a turning point.</p>
<p>Our old nation has already</p>
<p>begun to revive.</p>
<p>If this spirit and this emotion can continue to be maintained and can be universally promoted, it will definitely become a force—a great and magnificent force. With this force, we will definitely be able to overcome the current national crisis and open up a path to national survival. However, the lessons of history are indeed valuable. Remembering the past is a teacher for the future. Naive optimism is often the cause of tragedy. The emotions of our people have not never been excited. It is just that the excitement in the past was temporary, partial, and superficial, rather than lasting, universal, and from the heart. After the event, it dissipated. "Five minutes of heat" has formed today's half-dead situation. All those who truly care about the national fortune, who do not grieve. The distant does not need to be discussed, the small does not need to be discussed, just take the celebration of the completion of the Northern Expedition as an example. The enthusiasm of the emotions at that time was not only not inferior to today, but even the newspapers of the great powers used extra-large characters to mark it, believing that the sleeping lion of China had already started to move and was roaring... But, how long did it take for civil war to break out and foreign insults to come one after another—not only did foreign insults come, but also an unprecedented national crisis occurred. The cause of this, what is it?</p>
<p>I have long said, "The author often extensively examines the reasons for the wealth and strength of various countries and deeply studies the source of chaos in our country. It is always believed that the main reason why our country has been plagued by war, and even after the completion of the Northern Expedition, still cannot permanently eliminate the root of chaos and maintain a permanent peace is that there is no unified and sound public opinion.</p>
<p>The common disease of mankind is to pay attention only to superficial decoration and neglect thorough change. The accumulated abuses of politics in the past have also been to pay attention only to the military achievements of one or two heroes on horseback, and have not devoted themselves to the cultivation of the strength of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The greatness of the Chinese revolution is certainly not the same as the replacement of dynasties in the past, and the significance and mission of the completion of the Northern Expedition are also completely different from those who have made military achievements and seized the country on horseback. It is regrettable that the strength of the people has never been able to go hand in hand with military victory. By the time the military was settled and the Northern Expedition was completed, the strength of the people was still not strong, the will of the people was still not unified, and the party members failed to actually run around to spread the news and consolidate military victory for a long time..." (Note 2)</p>
<p>When I wrote this article, I was still studying in Europe, isolated from politics, and had no prejudices of favor or resentment. The present view of the past is like the future view of the present. How will we strive to serve the country so as not to be in name only, or just empty words, and not fail the original intention of our joy and celebration? This is something that those who truly care about the national fortune and love the leader should seriously consider and practice diligently.</p>
<h3>Preparation for the Establishment of the China National Products Promotion Group, Chinese Work-Study Supplementary School</h3>
<p>The China National Products Promotion Group is jointly organized by the China Kangyuan Canning Factory and the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute. It has been established for half a year. The salesmen recruited have all received considerable training. The prices are cheap and uniform, and it is trusted by all walks of life. The initiators of the group, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Pan Yangyao, Mr. He Qingru, etc., recently saw that it was difficult for unemployed and out-of-school youth to find a way out. They specially prepared to establish the Chinese Work-Study Supplementary School, where they study for half a day and sell national products for half a day. They recruit young men and women who have graduated from elementary school, aged 16 to 20. Tuition is completely free, and lunch is provided. There is also a commission and bonus every month. It is reported that they will advertise for enrollment soon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange turned strong again. Both the Sichuan and Gold gangs bought in, mostly for speculative purposes. The North gang sold quite a bit. Based on the evolution of the environmental situation, it should not be far away. Yesterday, in the morning opening, No. 5 first bought in, and No. 34 subsequently covered positions. The market price rose unanimously by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan. In the final settlement, No. 10 and No. 46 sold very strongly, and the market price fell back unanimously by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the Sichuan and Gold gangs suddenly absorbed, and retail investors were exhausted and bought in. No. 35 had the strongest appetite, and the market price rose unanimously, rising by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan. The closing price remained firm, and buying still felt greater than supply. No. 54 also bought in, and Grade E rose by 0.35 and 0.2 yuan, while the rest rose by only 0.15 yuan. Although the trend was good, it was unfortunately not allowed by the environment. As a result, the market price rose unanimously by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The total number of transactions was 7,185,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). Also, November 12 is the Premier's birthday, and the government bond market will be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of Resolution of Labor Strike in Japanese Factories, Yarn Market Fell Back at Closing</h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm, and the momentum turned mild. The sales of spot yarn were mediocre, so people's hearts were ordinary. However, most people's psychology was that the spot yarn roots of the factories had not been greatly loosened, so they were unwilling to give up the tightening of near-term yarn. By the time of closing, it was mostly said that the labor strike in the yarn factories had been resolved, and the market rebounded.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of machine-made yarn varied.</p>
<p>At the opening of the front market for standard yarn, the market was slightly weak due to the mediocre news about foreign cotton. However, the labor strike in the Japanese yarn factories in this port was turbulent, and new buyers were wary. Therefore, the market situation was calm. After the second round, it was heard that yarn sales were not smooth, and the second-grade yarn market fell back, falling slightly. As a result of the standard yarn, the closing prices of each month on the previous day fell by 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.8 yuan. At the opening of the afternoon market, the momentum was slightly tighter, and the market price showed a slight increase. The situation in the second and third rounds remained tight. By the time of closing, the market fell back, and it was rumored that the labor strike in the yarn factories had come to an end and there was no problem. As a result, each month rose slightly by 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that 5,650 bales of Changfeng, 1,400 bales of Changyu, 2,150 bales of Mingde, 1,600 bales of Hexing, 1,800 bales of Renfeng, 1,550 bales of Run Kang, 1,650 bales of Changji, and 1,850 bales of Da Chang were sold. 1,900 bales of Dafu, 3,450 bales of Gengfeng, 1,400 bales of Shenji, 1,450 bales of Da Changcheng, 2,350 bales of Xiecheng, 1,600 bales of Da Chang, 1,000 bales of Shengyuan, and 1,000 bales of Yongda were purchased. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are quite clear.</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn were flat. It was found that a total of 775 bales were purchased by various gangs throughout the day, and the price of thread rose by 2 yuan, while the price of yarn was firm. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Production Increases Sharply, Cotton Market Loosens Greatly</h3>
<p>The arrival of goods is abundant... prices are high and sales are sluggish. The cotton market is very weak, and the decline is drastic. The fourth estimate of US cotton production was released, with a production of 12.4 million bales, an increase of 791,000 bales compared to the previous estimate. Fortunately, the market price only fell by more than 10 points, so the selling momentum was still flat. However, most people believe that the increase in cotton production will lead to lower cotton prices.</p>
<p>The price of standard cotton fell by 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>At the opening of the front market for standard cotton, the estimated production of US cotton was released as 12.4 million bales, an increase of 791,000 bales compared to the previous estimate, falling by 10 points. As a result, people were shocked and the selling momentum was strong. The near-term decline was fierce, and the decline in the far-term was still moderate. After the second round, it was still ordinary. By the time of closing, the number of contracts was slightly exhausted, and it rose back by 0.1 yuan. As a result, each month fell by 0.235 yuan compared to the closing price on the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon market, it improved slightly due to short covering. After the second round, it was heard that the source was abundant and the spot cotton factory's appetite was blocked. The near-term decline rebounded. As a result, each month fell by 0.15 yuan compared to the closing price in the morning. It was found that 10,700 dan of Changhe, 2,100 dan of Dafeng, 5,200 dan of Tongji, 2,000 dan of Yuda, 4,500 dan of Hexing, 1,000 dan of Huamao, 2,400 dan of Changfeng, 12,600 dan of Jian Kang, 4,700 dan of Yuan Xingchang, 3,800 dan of Tai Chang, and 2,400 dan of Xin Cheng were sold. 9,100 dan of Da Chang, 2,000 dan of Renfeng, 5,500 bales of Fengtai, 2,600 dan of Daxue, 6,500 dan of Hengyi, 2,000 dan of Juyu, 2,000 dan of Dafeng, 6,900 dan of Jinchang, 2,300 dan of Shenchang, 4,800 dan of Shengyuan, and 1,300 dan of Ruid were purchased. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot cotton factories need to stop.</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has stopped, and the factory's appetite is completely blocked. Japanese factories are still offering very low prices, so no transactions have been made in the market. The source is 1,080 bales of Yaohua and 950 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<h3>After the Government Report Was Released, US Cotton Declined Unanimously - After the Government Report Was Released - English and Indian Cotton Rose and Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with each month falling by 1 point to rising by 4 points. The market situation was uncertain in the early morning. After rising once, the industry took profits. Then, due to long covering and large-scale hedging, the market price fell. The industry and sellers still bought in. Regarding the trend of cotton futures, opinions differ. The buyers rely on the strong sales of cloth and the strength of spot cotton as the main force. After the government report was released, the spot cotton and cloth markets remained quiet and firm. According to the latest news from the New York Cotton Exchange, the Brazilian cotton harvest is between 1.38 million and 1.48 million bales. The previous estimate was between 1.6 million and 1.7 million bales, and last year it was 1.53 million bales. The closing price was stable, with spot cotton falling by 11 points and futures falling by 9 to 13 points. English spot cotton rose by 1 point, and futures fell by 8 to 10 points. Indian cotton long covering was offset by purchases from exporters. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1.25 Robis, Aomula rose by 2 to 2.25 Robis, and Bairoxi rose by 1 Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 9th).</p>
<p>According to the forecast of the opening price on the previous day, Bairoxi was 218 Robis, falling by 1.75 Robis, Aomula was 196 Robis, falling by 1.75 Robis, and Pingguoer wrote 157 Robis, falling by 2 Robis.</p>
<h3>Last Week's Cotton Export Volume from Rangoon</h3>
<p>The 9th Bombay telegram, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week, a total of 439 tons, of which 125 tons to Kobe, 304 tons to Osaka, and 10 tons to Venus.</p>
<h3>Three Types of Yarn and Cotton All Fell Back</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram on the 10th, the price of three types of yarn futures fell by 0.5 to 1.7 yuan, recently 229.8 yuan, far month 208.7 yuan, cotton futures fell by 0.7 to 1 yuan, recently 65.75 yuan, far month 65.95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fifth Government Report on US Cotton, Increased by 791,000 Bales Compared to the Previous Report</h3>
<p>Washington telegram on the 9th, the fifth government report on US cotton was officially released today by the Department of Agriculture Cotton Harvest Report Bureau, with an estimated production of 12,400,000 bales, an increase of 791,000 bales compared to the previous report. The quiet situation of the same period in the previous five years is also recorded on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<p>The seventh ginning report released by the Department of Commerce Statistics Bureau is attached as follows.</p>
<p>Ginned Quantity</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Actual Sales of Coarse Cloth Gradually Improve, Sales of Blue Cloth Are Particularly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the price of standard yarn and cotton fell slightly in the cloth market, the spot yarn roots were still extremely scarce, and the price of fine yarn rose by 2 yuan. The prices of printed goods and white goods from the cloth factory were both moderate. However, the price of Dong goods, fine cloth, and fine twill had risen for four consecutive days. Yesterday, the market had turned slightly moderate. However, because the strikes in the Tongxing and other factories had not been resolved, there was a shortage of spot goods in the market, so the price of fine cloth continued to rise by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece, and the price of fine twill rose by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan per piece. The market price of 84 raw cloth had stabilized. The current sales of assembled cloth from various factories of Chinese and British merchants were gradually improving, and supply and demand were quite equal. It is said that the coarse and heavy-pound coarse cloth produced by the Yihuo Factory sold the best, with nearly 200 yuan being distributed every day, and it was still not enough to meet demand. Yesterday, the gangs in this street and Hankou Anqing and other places continued to buy more than 100 bales of coarse cloth from the Yihuo Factory, more than 200 bales of Dong goods, fine cloth, fine tweed, and 84 cloth. The Changzhou gang bought more than 100 pieces of fine twill, thread tweed, and serge from various weaving factories in Changzhou in December. The current sales of gangs in Fujian, Yunnan, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Henan, and other places are very weak, and they are only urging the shipment of goods ordered earlier. The current sales of blue cloth have become stagnant, and the sales routes in various places are not smooth, with a lot of goods being stranded. The British Ren Chang Factory announced that the price of the Haoxia map had been reduced from 12.1 yuan to 11.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Weather Is Getting Colder, and the Supply of Thick Overcoat Woolens Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, thick goods such as overcoat woolens were widely sold in the market. The wool and Western clothing stores on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line were all buying in. In early winter, the weather is getting colder, and the actual sales are increasing sharply. There are continued selections of custom-made clothing. Plain thick woolens, Melton, Polish-made embossed head woolens, and purple inverted pure wool thick woolens are selling very well, and the supply is not enough to meet demand. High-end thick overcoat woolens with a price of more than 10 yuan per yard, such as Renziyu, plaid, embossed, silver gun, corduroy, cloud head, and ball head woolens, are also extremely scarce and selling well. Yesterday, ordinary thick embossed cloud head woolens from Poland were sold wholesale at 4.5 yuan per yard, single-width 3.3 yuan, Huabo Shililuoyuan Chang Camel plain flower woolens were sold wholesale at 5.15 yuan, inverted pure wool was 5 yuan, and Baoda oblique flower overcoat woolens were 7 yuan, and deputy number 6.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain: It Is Difficult for Flour and Wheat to Rise or Fall</h3>
<p>The flour market initially rose and then fell, presenting a precarious situation. According to wheat reports, Chicago and Canada fell by a few cents to more than 0.1 yuan. However, Liverpool rose by 0.5 points to 1.875 points, so at the beginning of the morning opening, people's hearts saw a slight improvement, rising by about 0.5 points compared to the previous day. Then, the market situation was flat, and the major players slightly returned. As a result, the market atmosphere gradually flattened. By the time of the afternoon opening, the transaction was very clear. There was little fluctuation in the current month, and the far-term months were flat and abnormal due to outside observation and weak buying interest. According to the current situation, it will present mutual rejection, and raising prices is feared to be close to foreign wheat. As far as domestic wheat prices are concerned, it seems that it cannot be too loose for a while, so the transaction is silent and it is difficult for both parties to make progress.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month was generally calm. The market atmosphere was very clear when the opening price was opened because the quotations of foreign wheat had ups and downs. Although wheat has been ordered to fall, there should be a local process at this point. It is difficult to expect an increase, and it is still impossible to approach foreign wheat, so both sides reject each other and the transaction is clear. By the time of the afternoon opening, the current month was quite weak due to the sluggish spot wheat, and the closing price had fallen to 0.9 yuan. The far-term months were generally lower by 0.0345 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse Indica Rice Was Popularly Purchased by Cantonese Gang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, guest indica rice was in high demand and the market was in a stable situation. However, there was less new arrival of brown rice and the Cantonese gang resumed heavy purchases. Yesterday, 4,500 bags were traded, and the market slightly stepped up by 0.035 yuan. The arrival of machine-milled rice was high and the market was originally weak, but yesterday the Beiyang and Henan gangs both had shipments, and the appetite of this street was also good, so the market was still supportable. Throughout the day, 1,638 bags of Jiangsi rice, 6,800 bags of Xiang rice, and 1,330 bags of Yongtai rice were opened. The selling price was similar to the previous market, except for brown rice.</p>
<h3>Thick New Japonica Rice Arrival Is Rare and the Market Is Stable</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than 50 sources arrived from various gangs, with a total of 11,450 stones of goods, of which thin rice accounted for the majority. The sales market in this street was dull, and the Pingjin Qingyan gangs continued to handle more than 5,000 bags of thin rice. However, because there were a lot of leftover goods every day, the selling side was more discouraged, and the guest gang's eating plate was also harsh, so the market fell by 0.22 yuan. Thick new japonica rice relied on the scarcity of goods and the market was stable. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan were all unchanged.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were not many arrivals from various routes in Hexia, only 278. The market appetite was normal. Thin rice was thick and the sales were sluggish, and the price fell by 0.1 yuan, while Bian Yuan stood up. The price of new japonica rice was tightly tied, and the high school was stable. The remaining rice had no ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Price Increased by 0.0506 Yuan - Transactions of 68,000 Pieces -</h3>
<p>Since the Shantou gang ordered the opening of forward goods, the soybean cake market has turned from a silent situation to a vigorous atmosphere. One is that the Cantonese gang is making progress, and the other is that Dalian continues to rise. The oil and beans in this city have risen, so the manufacturers are selling at a steady price. As a result, the market price has increased by 0.0506 yuan compared to the previous market. It is estimated that 11,000 pieces of spot cake were traded at each Luo Si brand, and the price was opened from 1.74 yuan to 0.06 yuan. The order for delivery in January was successfully completed at 21,000 pieces, and the price was 1.8 yuan. The order for opening in a month was 30,000 pieces, and the price rose from 1.82 yuan to 0.083 yuan. The forward trend still needs to be changed according to the rise and fall of Dalian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Rose Unanimously, Standard Silk Trading in New York Was Quite Active, and the Silk Market in This Port Also Strengthened Accordingly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market in New York, Australia, and Lyon rose sharply. It is estimated that the near-term rose by 0.065 yuan and the far-term rose by 0.075 yuan in New York, which is equivalent to a total increase of 18.0 yuan in the Shanghai market. Japanese silk rose by 0.06 yuan uniformly in the United States, and Shanghai and Guangdong silk each rose by 0.04 yuan. Standard silk trading was quite active, and the total number of transactions in the market was 4,050 bales. The spot price in Yokohama was sold at 850 yuan, which is estimated to be an increase of 17 yuan, and the futures also rose by 17 yuan. Lyon Japanese silk rose by 2 francs, Shanghai silk A-character B-character each rose by 1.50 francs, and Guangdong silk rose by 1 franc. The silk market in this port also tended to strengthen. Yesterday, Lianna Mitsui and other banks were very willing to purchase, and Yihuo and other banks also had more incoming accounts. However, because the market atmosphere in Shanghai was too sensitive, some transactions still need to be determined tomorrow. Yesterday, a total of 325 bales of domestic and foreign silk were sold, and the market was like a three-step dance level, which has been increased by 20% compared to the previous day, and the ordinary has also been increased by 10 yuan to 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— (Shoulun)</p>
<p>Struggle Is the Mother of Success - "Failure is the mother of success" This sentence is simply incomprehensible, and many people have been fooled by it and fallen, which is extremely regrettable. The original intention of saying this sentence was not to be criticized. It was believed that after failure, one should not be discouraged, and should continue to work hard and must succeed. But putting together two sentences with opposite meanings, and deleting the most basic meaning in the middle, this is a big mistake after all, so it should be changed to "struggle is the mother of success"? Or add a sentence before it and say: "Don't be discouraged by the harvest failure, always work hard and struggle."</p>
<p>I remember that the ancient Greek thinker Heraclitus once said a very famous sentence in the history of thought: "Struggle is the father of all things", which can be used for comparison here.</p>
<p>Life is a kind of battle, and everyone is a soldier on the battlefield of life: without struggle, there is no activity, so there can be progress, and where can success or victory come from. This is because struggle is the beginning of activity, activity is the means of progress, and only with progress can we reach the realm of success or victory: therefore, to seek victory and success, we must first struggle indomitably. As for those who are discouraged by failure and no longer seek struggle, they are just slaves.</p>
<h3>Poet Beggar</h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>"My nature is wild and free from birth, I carry a bamboo staff through Tongzhou,</p>
<p>A rice basket greets the waning moon at dawn, a songboard sings of late autumn in the wind;</p>
<p>My feet have trod the dusty paths of the world, my shoulders bear the sorrows of all ages,</p>
<p>Now I refuse to accept food given in pity, the village dogs need not bark incessantly."</p>
<p>This is a beggar's poem I saw long ago in the "Suiyuan Poetry Talks." This poem reveals his leisurely self-possession as a beggar, expresses his grievances for becoming a beggar, and is truly worthy of endless recitation. As for this poem, it was found by his side after the beggar died; so someone buried him and erected a stone tablet inscribed "Tomb of the Poet Beggar of Tongzhou," which was considered a small act of cherishing talent. This poet beggar did not want to flaunt his poetic talent during his lifetime or rely on it to live a life of ease and comfort. Instead, he cherished his fine works and lived as a beggar. Such breadth of mind is truly admirable, and only those with such a mind can be called true poets.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, not only did many scholar-officials calmly die for their country and generously sacrifice themselves for righteousness, but even lowly beggars could not bear the country's fall and willingly sacrificed their lives for their homeland. "For three hundred years, the court supported scholars, but how is it that civil and military officials all fled? The moral principles of society remain in the humble farmlands, and the beggar is ashamed to preserve his life." This poem was left on Baichuan Bridge by a beggar who drowned himself in the Qinhuai River after the fall of the Southern Capital, and it was his suicide note. This poet beggar is beyond the reach of those who willingly serve foreign rulers today, and even some high officials should feel considerable shame in comparison.</p>
<p>According to a predecessor, in Shanghai during the Guangxu years, there was a female poet beggar who caused a sensation when she published her excellent works on the streets. People generously gave her money, so she obtained a considerable sum. Her poem was: "I sigh that my fate is unequal, for ten years I have wandered, gazing at Jiangxi: I regret entrusting my begging bowl to doorways, the cold waters of Shanghai provide the topic for my verses." Such elegant lines would naturally stir people's compassion for talent. The fact that this female poet beggar could come up with the ingenious method of using poetry to collect money also shows her intelligence.</p>
<p>Shanghai is, after all, a place of cultural gathering. In recent years, I have seen many male and female poet beggars. For example, "My sword and books drift, finding no place to rest, I beg from door to door every year: I urge you to give me more food, kind sir, I will repay your great kindness by tying grass and wearing a jade ring." I saw this recently on the asphalt road, and I cannot remember all the others. However, the purpose of these poets in displaying their poetic talent is nothing more than to obtain money. They cannot be mentioned in the same breath as the poet beggar in "Suiyuan Poetry Talks" or the patriotic beggar at the end of the Ming Dynasty. It can be seen that the poet beggars of ancient and modern times are very different.</p>
<h3>Listening to the Sound of Threshing Rice</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The autumn weather this year can truly be said to be the best ever; for two months, the sun has shone brightly, without a drop of rain, so the crops in the villages have all yielded a bumper harvest. For example, cotton averages almost a full load per acre, and the price of cotton is also exceptionally high. Compared to previous years when the harvest was poor and people came to the city in droves to protest famine, the difference is like heaven and earth. Therefore, there is a great atmosphere of revival in the countryside. Taking our Jiading as an example, it is originally "cotton seven, rice three," and rice fields only account for three-tenths of the land. Moreover, cotton fields are more common in the northeast villages, and only the west villages grow rice. So, these rice paddies do not amount to much. However, the weather has been windless and rainless until now. The cotton is good, and even yellow flowers are rare (yellow flowers are caused by continuous rain and mildew). Every piece is valuable. Those who plant rice usually lose money every year (because soybean cakes and labor costs are high, and with disasters, rice farming is always unprofitable). This year, they can barely make ends meet, and everyone is overjoyed, saying that Heaven has blessed us commoners and will not let us starve to death!</p>
<p>If you go to the countryside now, hum! The previously green rice leaves in the fields have all turned into a sea of yellow clouds, swaying in the wind, and the ears of rice are bowed down, as if they cannot bear the weight. It can be seen that the weather is clear and the rice grains are very long and full, with no empty husks. As the saying goes, "If there is still green rice at Cold Dew, all will fall by Frost's Descent." The Double Ninth Festival has passed, and instead of the usual autumn rains, the autumn light is exceptionally bright. The villagers take advantage of this good weather to cut the rice in the fields, carrying load after load to their doorsteps. On wooden racks, men and women are threshing the rice, creating piles of grain on the ground. Hearing this sound, "pat-tat! pat-tat!" one cannot help but know that it is a beautiful scene in the village. I once asked an old man in the countryside how much grain he could harvest this year. He smiled and said: "Not much, but quite a bit. At least one and a half piculs, or one picul if it's not so good. It's the best harvest in recent years. We farmers always depend on the weather. If it's windy and rainy, and Heaven doesn't favor us, how can we have such a good harvest?" He was clearly very pleased. It can be seen that the early rice crops in other places have also yielded bumper harvests. Our small coastal land in Jiading, especially the late rice, is just being harvested, but I want to write an article on his behalf as a celebration.</p>
<h3>Opening Envelopes</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are at least three ways for people from all walks of life to open envelopes. They are also somewhat humorous and superstitious. They are divided into three methods: "Rising High," "Windfall Fortune," and "Dropping Bottom." The three ways to open envelopes are recorded below.</p>
<p>Most families open the envelope at the top, which is called "Rising High." Generally, officials and businessmen aim to rise in rank and make a fortune, so when they open letters, they cut open the top of the envelope with scissors, then use two fingers to reach in and invite the letter inside to rise up. Then, they hold it in their hands and read it carefully.</p>
<p>Some businessmen open the envelope from the side, which is called "Windfall Fortune." What is "Windfall Fortune"? It is a transliteration of "horizontal cut." In addition to rising high, they also want to make a fortune, so when they open envelopes, they usually lick the edge of the envelope with saliva on the side, moisten the edge, and tear it open by hand. This is called "Windfall Fortune," also known as "horizontal cut," using its convenience and not using scissors. However, this way of opening letters seems too unrefined.</p>
<p>There are also some careless people who open the bottom of the letter, which is called "Dropping Bottom." The letter inside the envelope is pulled straight down, which is both inelegant and inconvenient. Some also consider it an inauspicious act. Wise people do not use this method. Of the three methods of opening letters above, the so-called "Rising High" is the most generous. As for taking advantage of auspicious words to regard them as omens of good or bad fortune, it is close to being humorous and involving superstition.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the Lake</h3>
<p>— (Chen Xiaocui)</p>
<p>The ancient trees of Baolong battle the wind, it was once said to be the King of Great Trees, a kind of autumn mountain like a liberated woman, her noble and aloof style abandons heavy makeup. (Written on a photo of Tianmu)</p>
<p>My horse is dark yellow, yours is plump, for a hundred years I’ve been wearing a scholar’s headscarf, a rare talent, ten thousand miles of blue clouds with flying geese, inquiring about the coarse cloth clothes of the women of Qizhou.</p>
<p>The clouds rise from Lishan, making the mountain seem to move, only the sound of rain threads on the Six Bridges, dusk does not allow red candles to be lit, for fear of attracting flying insects into the painted screen. The Shaobao Ancestral Hall has high clouds, thousand-year-old cypresses do not sprout, this heart has already turned into a stone of utter loyalty, unmoved by rain and wind. (The loyal cypress in the Yue Temple has turned into stone and is now stored in a stone room)</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Term "Nanjing Bug"</h3>
<p>— (Guo Zhenfang)</p>
<p>Mr. Pinlu has discussed "Nanjing Bugs in Shanghai" in this publication. Nanjing Bug is a Japanese term, and their intention is to insult the entire Chinese population, but they use Nanjing to represent it.</p>
<p>They call bedbugs Nanjing Bugs because, it is said, they originally did not exist there and were brought by Zhang Zhidong. Zhang was then the Governor-General of Liangjiang, stationed in Nanjing. According to their customs, they always use Nanjing to represent China. Therefore, they call Chinese rice "Nanjing Rice," peanuts "Nanjing Beans," domestic rabbits "Nanjing Rabbits," and so on. Nanjing Bug means Chinese Bug.</p>
<p>In fact, bedbugs are products of modern transportation cities. Is it only in Shanghai or Nanjing? Is it only in China or Japan? Paris, New York, and London all have their footprints. Moscow is almost as bad as Shanghai. "Foreign countries also have bedbugs," this is a sarcastic remark that Zhou Zuoren and others often use to oppose native culture.</p>
<h3>Maple Leaves</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>It was an autumn morning, I quietly stood by the window, playing with the reddened maple leaf, like reading a letter from home, a sense of parting and a measure of sadness had already climbed up from the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>A gust of autumn wind with a seasonal flavor drilled in from the open collar of my morning gown, making me feel "another year easily becomes autumn wind." I silently leaned against the window frame, as if preparing to attend a mournful funeral; my heart was filled with the sorrows of life. I only wanted to cry, but I couldn't, I should cherish my tears!</p>
<p>Before, I also liked autumn and would often run to the autumn fields to wander; in autumn, I used to go to the beach with my childhood companions to pick up seashells, and I would also watch the sad young women walking alone in the park, drifting through the autumn forest like a dream. But now, even that bit of mood has been buried by the sorrow of "middle age." Now, I am already a survivor who has weathered many storms and anxieties.</p>
<p>I still remember an autumn twelve years ago, when I was being taken away from my beloved hometown by a relative, leaving my warm home and entering this unfamiliar metropolis to begin experiencing life, struggling for survival; a layer of gray was smeared on my childish heart, but this layer of gray only thickened with the increase of years, and it could never be peeled off.</p>
<p>"Fei, have a safe journey, but being outside is not the same as being at home, you must be especially careful in everything, always listen to your teachers... " When the ship was about to leave the dock, my mother stood on the bank and said the words she had repeated hundreds of times to me, but when she got to the last few sentences, she was already sobbing and unable to complete the phrases.</p>
<p>I lowered my head, only watching the muddy water by the side of the ship flowing backward, I was like a prisoner awaiting execution, only waiting for the verdict of fate in the future, without considering whether my future would be happy or painful.</p>
<p>Without anticipation, without retrospection, I just silently let the ship carry me away. I was like a pitiful little lamb, unable to struggle or resist, I let them dispose of me at will, even sending me into a great furnace.</p>
<p>Looking back at my hometown, which was gradually moving away, I could still vaguely see the breakwater stretching out into the lake, and I could see my mother and older sister standing foolishly on the tip of the breakwater, like two plaster statues of the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>I wanted to shout, but I couldn't shout anymore, I wanted to cry, but looking at so many people, I didn't dare to cry, finally, I suppressed a hidden tear and stepped onto the distant future in a daze.</p>
<h3>Changing Nests of Luan and Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Vows Made with a Cup of Water, Green Lamps Tell of Wretchedness, Golden Hooks and Promised Fingers, Red Beans Report Mutual Yearning</p>
<p>Menglan smiled: "Get out of here, you're just looking for an opportunity to gossip." Xiaoju'er laughed and left. Menglan herself took out two fine colored imperial porcelain cups, first poured a cup of chrysanthemum tea and sent it to her, then took some of the pine nut candy and clear oil mung bean cake from the plate and sent it to her, smiling: "These were brought from Suzhou, have some. You've put in a lot of effort, this isn't a reward, just a small token of my appreciation." Youmei smiled, "What have I done that requires effort? I don't quite understand." Menglan said: "When you came this morning, you were dressed up like a butterfly, that was so you could find an excuse to speak your mind. When you came this evening, you had the old woman escort you, also so you could find an excuse to speak your mind. To have a friend like you, I'm truly grateful from the bottom of my heart." Youmei picked up the teacup and slowly sipped, her eyes fixed on Menglan's face. Menglan also lowered her head to drink tea, with a sentimental look. At this time, it began to rain again outside. The raindrops hit the leaves of the trees downstairs, making a rustling sound. Under the eaves, there was also a clanging sound. The sky outside the window was gloomy, and nothing could be seen. Only bursts of cool air were carried from the rain forest to the upper floor. They did not speak, and Youmei did not speak either. In the silence between the two, the night rain and the small building felt indescribably poignant. The white-shaded lamp seemed to have a dim, bluish-gray light. During the day, Menglan's complexion did not look so thin. Only in the evening, with the lamplight close to her face, could you see her shoulders deeply hunched, her eyes drooping, the color on her face faded, revealing a bit of haggardness. Youmei said: "You've been considering it all day. Now, tell me the truth, do you need my help?" Menglan said: "Of course, I need it." As she spoke, she showed great determination. So, when she put the teacup on the table, she also nodded twice. Youmei said: "We've been sitting here together in silence for so long, why are you still not speaking?" Menglan picked up a piece of pine nut candy from the plate and chewed it slowly. She seemed to want to say something, but she smiled slightly at Youmei and lowered her head again. When she lowered her head like this, a blush appeared on her face, which made her complexion look better. Youmei said: "I know what's on your mind, you're probably afraid that if you tell me, I'll casually tell others. Actually, we've been together since we were little, there's nothing we don't talk about. You know a lot about my private affairs, why aren't I afraid of you telling others?" Menglan neither denied nor admitted this, she just shook her head twice, still with a thick smile on her face. (96)</p>

<h3>Steady Progress in the Treatment of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>...The course and changes of gonorrhea, as well as internal medication therapy and external washing therapy... Testicular swelling causes loss of fertility due to gonococcal invasion of testicular function... If the husband suffers from gonorrhea, the wife is also at risk of infection, what methods can be used to avoid it?</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is an extremely common disease, and its transmission is very rapid, so there are many people who suffer from this disease. According to medical research, the widespread prevalence of gonorrhea is due to direct transmission in the reproductive parts, such as marital discord, husbands frequenting prostitutes, or young people being tempted by bad friends to set foot in brothels during times of sexual awakening. However, according to sociologists, it is due to world civilization, the rising standard of living, and people's inability to marry.</p>
<p>People with gonorrhea should not marry or share a bed with their wives before being cured, otherwise the other party will be innocently harmed. It is pitiful that many innocent women are harmed by unscrupulous men, resulting in chronic leucorrhea and loss of fertility. The in-laws then want to take a concubine for their son, which is truly tragic, and male scrotal swelling is also a cause of infertility, but it is commonly blamed on the wives, which is unfair. From this point of view, men, whether married or not, must quickly receive fundamental treatment to avoid worry.</p>
<p>However, the treatment of gonorrhea cannot be effective casually. Since protein therapy has risen to the forefront of gonorrhea treatment, some manufacturers have copied the protein therapy by imitating the effect of yellow pigments. These imitations are secretly appearing on the market. But the only truly effective drug is one that uses protein to promote the function of human white blood cells to kill gonococci. There is no other way besides this. Gonorrhea patients can ask their doctors and review gonorrhea books to see if my words are indeed based on evidence. This type of protein-yellow pigment compound is "Kelinong." This medicine also has a definite therapeutic effect on female leucorrhea. If a woman is infected with gonorrhea by her husband, resulting in persistent leucorrhea, she should take "Kelinong" internally to clear the gonococcal toxins, and at the same time use "Carter-Shield Vaginal Tablets" externally, inserting one or two tablets into the vagina every night to wash away the leucorrhea. This can completely cure the condition and allow for normal childbirth!</p>
<p>The special effect of "Kelinong" is also proven for male prostatitis, orchitis, and arthritis. However, after taking this medicine internally, it must also be treated externally. This double-pronged approach will show results even faster. Therefore, one should take "Kelinong" to clear the gonococcal toxins in the blood, and at the same time use the most effective "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urethra. In the morning, the pus and turbidity seal the opening, and the semen and blood are mixed. Once washed, the pus and turbidity will be eliminated, and urination will be smooth.</p>
<p>For gonorrhea today, there are reliable methods for both internal and external treatment, which is a cause for celebration!</p>
<h3>An Axe for Sexual Nature, Unhappy Couples</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>...Families shrouded in clouds of sorrow. ...Nineteen are created by men.</p>
<p>The happiness of life is nothing more than the intensity of love between the sexes, but many young couples, on the surface, seem to have nothing to be dissatisfied with. In fact, they only have unspeakable hidden diseases. According to our clinical statistics, these couples actually live tragic lives, and the fault is mostly on the male side. The reason is that men, during the period of sexual development, are played with by bad friends or misread obscene books, resulting in the bad habit of masturbation. This bad habit can cause sexual dysfunction. The most obvious change is that the differentiation of the epithelial cells on the inner side of the kidney cavity cannot develop normally. The tissues of the gonads also lose their healthy form. The output tubes of the gonads do not have the ability to perform secretion. Therefore, the development of the genitals is naturally severely hindered. What is closely related to fertility is the prostate. This gland is responsible for nourishing sperm, and masturbation often damages the prostate, preventing it from secreting fluid. Therefore, even if there are sperm, they will die due to lack of gland fluid to nourish them, resulting in male infertility. These symptoms are all evil consequences caused by masturbation. Furthermore, due to the loss of hormones, the central nervous system lacks this kind of stimulation, sexual desire disappears, and erectile power is lost. Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, thin semen, and lack of sperm. Other symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, forgetfulness, and palpitations also occur together. Masturbation is truly an axe for sexual nature!</p>
<p>According to my experience after graduating from the Russian Labor University, the most effective treatment for this is to take "Butikang." This medicine is made from strong animals, and after taking it, it is transported to various parts of the body through blood circulation, boosting hormone production. Therefore, the central nervous system also receives stimulation, sexual sensation is restored, and the sexual organs also receive sufficient development. As a result, the love between the sexes is also restored due to healthy sexual tissue. The sorrowful clouds in the family are also replaced by pleasant air. At that time, you will naturally know the true essence of love and sexuality in life, and the sweet family will be happy. "Butikang" is truly a gospel for both sexes, and it is unanimously adopted by doctors from all countries. However, patients with nocturnal emission can also take "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets," which will further cure the patient.</p>
<h3>Extremely Painful Acute Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou Jiyun, 21 years old. Last month, he attended a banquet at a restaurant with friends. In a drunken haze, he entered Pingkang, but little did he know that once he enjoyed the spring breeze, the roots of sin were planted. Mr. Zhou had contracted gonorrhea. Confused by the words of a quack doctor, he mistakenly took inferior medicine. After two weeks of treatment, the condition worsened, the glans became inflamed and swollen, the foreskin became enlarged, and a large amount of thick liquid was secreted. Urination became frequent, and each time he urinated, the pain was unbearable. He cried day and night. Introduced to me by Mr. Lin Zibing, I took the pus secreted by the patient and examined it under a microscope. There were many gonococci, as dense as hair (see Figure 1). I then cleaned his urethra and instructed him to take "Kelinong" to reduce inflammation, relieve pain, promote diuresis, and kill bacteria. After two weeks of treatment, the swelling and pain were completely cured. However, there were still gonococcal threads in the urine. I instructed him to take "Kelinong" for another week, and then examined him again under a microscope. There were no traces of gonococcal threads. In order to investigate whether he was cured, I tested his blood. There was still no gonococcal reaction, and it was pure blood (see Figure 2). Only then could I prove that he was completely cured.</p>
<h3>Figure 1</h3>
<p>Before taking "Kelinong," many gonococci are clustered on pus cells.</p>
<h3>Figure 2</h3>
<p>After taking "Kelinong," the gonococci have disappeared. This is a pure blood smear.</p>
<h3>Dr. Yao Juyan's Lecture on Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>(Clinic): Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road (Consultation Hours): 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>How to Resolve Recurrent Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Recurrent gonorrhea is very common in patients who have had gonorrhea for a long time but have not received correct and thorough treatment. This is because patients often neglect treatment when the symptoms of acute gonorrhea subside, allowing the infection to spread deeper. Gonococci can hide and multiply in any loose tissue, causing various unpredictable complications. Patients only seek medical treatment when a symptom appears. Once the symptom disappears, they still don't pay attention. If they encounter significant stimulation such as drinking alcohol, physical activity, or sexual activity, it suddenly recurs. Patients often feel physically tired, mentally abnormal, and have difficulty urinating with severe pain, often radiating to the anus and perineum. Such gonorrhea spreads over a very wide range, so the treatment method must take into account all aspects. Only by following this treatment principle can a radical cure be achieved. This treatment method involves taking "Kelinnong" internally, which causes the patient to develop anti-gonococcal toxins in a short period of time, surrounding and killing the gonococci hidden in the deep parts of the body, leaving no survivors. I also supplement with short-wave and long-wave electrotherapy, serum therapy, and X-ray therapy for even faster results.</p>
<p>For this type of recurrence, it is also important to prevent transmission to the opposite sex. Some patients with this type of gonorrhea may neglect long-term abstinence and prevention. Mr. Li Zhiji of East Xihua Road, for example, suffered from gonorrhea in the past but neglected treatment; the symptoms were not very severe, but the disease recurred whenever he was tired or had sexual activity. He also infected his wife. Later, he purchased my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" from the Great East Bookstore and came to me for treatment. After undergoing surgery and electrotherapy, he was also instructed to take "Kelinnong" internally to reduce inflammation, kill bacteria, and relieve pain. After four weeks, his urination was smooth and clear. All symptoms such as swelling and pain in the anus and perineum were quickly cured. His wife's leucorrhea was also treated by me, using "Kelinnong" internally and "Car-Schede vaginal suppositories" externally to eliminate the discharge, and she recovered in three to four weeks. (His wife's illness was treated at home according to the instructions). Mr. and Mrs. Li both underwent serum tests, with no reaction. They have lived together ever since, and have experienced various major stimuli without any recurrence. This proves that they are completely cured.</p>
<h3>Vaginal Diseases Caused by Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>— Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>The female vagina is more prone to disease than any other part of the body due to its constant moisture and the wear and tear of sexual activity and childbirth. Leucorrhea is one of these diseases. The patient's vaginal lining becomes inflamed and eroded, with a frequent flow of foul-smelling fluid. This discharge is milky white, known as leucorrhea. However, if it invades the capillaries, it often contains blood streaks or drops, commonly called red discharge. In fact, this condition arises from improper treatment of leucorrhea and often leads to menstrual difficulties and infertility, not only harming the husband's health and eroding beauty.</p>
<p>"Car-Schede Vaginal Suppositories" are a sacred medicine for sweeping away leucorrhea, capable of relieving pain, eliminating inflammation, stopping secretion, and preventing decay, with effects visible in three to four weeks. However, for those caused by gonorrhea, "Kelinnong" can also be taken internally. For menstrual problems caused by leucorrhea, "Bunujung" can also be taken internally to treat both conditions simultaneously. The subtlety of this treatment lies in self-treatment at home, without the need to bother a doctor. For those using "Car-Schede Vaginal Suppositories," one suppository can be inserted into the vagina every night before bed and washed away the next morning, with absolutely no irritation. Therefore, it is favored by women with leucorrhea.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>...Lung disease is a chronic illness, treatment must be suitable for economic circumstances... Although there is no specific medicine, gentle and effective medicines can still cure... Patients are all physically weak, so strengthening physical strength is very beneficial.</p>
<p>Let's set aside all prejudices and talk realistically about the treatment of lung disease. This may be of practical benefit to those suffering from lung disease.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, there is still no specific treatment for lung disease today. Surgical operations and physical therapy are only relatively effective, and those preparations can only increase the patient's resistance and help eliminate bacilli. This is a consensus among physicians in various countries today. Therefore, lung disease also urgently requires internal medicine.</p>
<p>If it is said that lung disease can only be cured with surgery (rib resection, artificial pneumothorax), then why do doctors in sanatoriums still have patients take cough suppressants and expectorants, or take and inject hemostatic agents? If sanatoriums do not use internal medicine at all for lung patients, then lung disease internal medicine can be completely abolished; otherwise, it should still be continuously researched to find more effective internal medicine for supplementing the lungs.</p>
<p>Lung disease is a chronic illness, and treatment must be affordable. If handled properly, it can also be cured with home treatment. The recently invented "Bofeinar" is a powerful oral medication for treating lung disease. This agent can strengthen the body and increase resistance, so after taking it, cough and phlegm become loose, chest pain is relieved, and hemoptysis stops. It is truly the most ideal preparation.</p>
<h3>A New Approach to Treating Women's Diseases</h3>
<p>— Song Zhongyu, Graduate of Army Medical University</p>
<p>...Abolish the simple method of blood-tonifying treatment... Increasing hormones is the most outstanding.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia, menstrual irregularities, and prolonged infertility are the most common symptoms among women's diseases. These symptoms are usually called women's diseases. In fact, to treat diseases, we should start from the root to find a thorough treatment. Because the root cause of women's diseases lies in the most important reproductive organs, such as the ovaries and uterus, we must first adjust these important organs to completely resolve women's diseases. Only then can we achieve the goal of health and beauty.</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience since graduating from the Army Medical University, adjusting the ovaries and enhancing metabolic function can completely correct the pathological state; at the same time, menstrual difficulties can be resolved, fertility can be increased, and neurasthenia symptoms such as headaches, insomnia, palpitations, depression, blurred vision, and tinnitus can be cured. Moreover, because it increases metabolic function, women's anemia and chlorosis can be eliminated, transforming the skin, making it delicate and fair, plumping the cheeks, and restoring lost youthfulness. These effects are not only effective in my personal experience; the women's community in Europe and America also knows that "Bunujung" is an internal medicine that fundamentally treats women's menstrual irregularities, neurasthenia, and premature aging. For those with leucorrhea, "Car-Schede Vaginal Suppositories" can also be used externally as suppositories to eliminate discharge and prevent decay for even faster results.</p>
<h3>Achieving a Happy Sexual Life for Couples</h3>
<p>...How to correct the obstacles between couples... Dr. Chen Minbo, who studied in Japan... Righteous Pursuit of Happy Family Joy</p>
<p>Love between men and women, observed from the physiological and psychological aspects, can be said to be entirely built on sexual love. When love reaches the final stage, it enters the physical realm. When couples are deeply in love, their intimate state is expressed through sexual love. If a husband loses his strong masculine function, the wife is like entering a nunnery, vainly wasting her limited youth. As a result, unfortunate events will unfold, and divorce, quarrels, elopement, etc., will all be staged.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the new era, how couples should maintain a fulfilling sexual life is an indispensable task. However, some weak husbands, in order to please their wives, take the risk of buying aphrodisiacs, the drawbacks of which will inevitably lead to a shortened lifespan.</p>
<p>Doctors who have the responsibility of protecting people's health should quickly ban those aphrodisiacs and engage in saving some patients with weakened sexual function. Because patients have exhausted hormones due to excessive sexual activity or masturbation during development, leading to nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, renal atrophy, premature ejaculation, and weak erection, the hormone preparation "Buticong" should be quickly used to invigorate the body's hormones and strengthen nerves, thereby restoring healthy kidney function and achieving a happy sexual life. As for the symptoms of nocturnal emission, "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets" can be taken at the same time, so that nocturnal emission can be completely cured!</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines are all specified by doctors who have graduated from medical universities at home and abroad. Please be sure to identify the names of each medicine when purchasing! Do not blindly believe others and buy miscellaneous inferior medicines, so as not to cause danger after taking them.</p>
<p>Reduced Appetite and Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Editor: I have suffered from stomach disease for more than two years. The pain in my stomach is so severe that I faint; every time it occurs, I have to lie in bed and groan, covered in cold sweat. I have no appetite and usually only eat eggs, milk, bread, and other things. I have constipation and a lot of gas in my intestines, often passing cold farts. I have tried many treatments without success. Last month, I was introduced by my friend Mr. Chen Jianwen to purchase and take "Qiangweijing." After taking about three bottles, the stomach pain was reduced and my appetite increased. I was happy and took five bottles in a row, which completely cured me. My bowel movements are now smooth and my appetite is good. Good medicine saves lives, and it is truly worth praising. (Letter from Wang Xilai, Jiaxing)</p>
<p>Colds</p>
<p>Mr. Han Jiangang asks: I have a cold and cough with a lot of phlegm that is difficult to cough up. What medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>Answer: You can take the lung-supplementing special medicine "Bofeinar" to resolve phlegm, eliminate coughs, and prevent tuberculosis. Your lungs will be cured.</p>
<p>Welcome to ask about illnesses! Please indicate your address and include a return postage, and send it to No. 869, Wuding Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Safest Body-Supplementing Method for Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan</p>
<p>Why do most opium smokers like to smoke again after quitting, or think about quitting but fail? There are two reasons for this:</p>
<p>(1) Opium poison can destroy the body's hormones, causing cell function to atrophy, leading to muscle wasting and listlessness. They are afraid of everything.</p>
<p>(2) There is no suitable medicine to invigorate hormones. Or they specialize in promoting gonadal supplements, which is unrealistic, so quitting is full of pain.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most effective method for quitting smoking is to supplement the body and invigorate the body's hormones, so that cells and nerves are healthy, and there is no pain when quitting. According to this, the hormone agent "Buticong" is the best medicine for quitting smoking.</p>

<h3>The Fall of Madrid</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>Reuter's London dispatch on the 7th: "According to official sources, the Spanish National Government has moved from Madrid to Valencia City on the east coast..." What will happen after the relocation of the capital? It is said that: "They will continue to fight against the National Army." In this case, even if Madrid falls, it cannot be said that the Spanish Civil War has ended. On the contrary, the Spanish Civil War will enter a new stage after the fall of Madrid.</p>
<p>Since the left-wing Popular Front won in Spain, the open and secret struggles between the left and right wings have become more acute, and tragic bloodshed has occurred frequently. On April 17 this year, the Azaña government announced an order to dissolve the Fascist organizations, imposing heavy pressure on right-wing organizations. This forced the right-wing groups to beg for help from major chaebols, attempting to overthrow the left-wing government by force in order to obstruct the realization of the government's system of resolving labor disputes. This conspiracy was later discovered by the government, and a large-scale arrest of more than 1,000 right-leaning elements was carried out. At that time, the leader of the monarchist party, Soutelo, was suddenly assassinated on April 13, which aroused widespread resentment from the Fascist Party and the monarchist party, and finally triggered a rebellion in Morocco, a Spanish protectorate, on the 18th. The famous Spanish Civil War was thus launched, and until the Spanish government moved its capital on the 7th of this month, the loss of people's lives and property was countless. At the same time, in this war, the faces of international peacemakers and aggressors were revealed.</p>
<p>Rather than calling it the Spanish Civil War, it is more like a microcosm of a second world war. In this civil war, through the so-called "non-intervention agreement," we can see the support of Germany, Italy, and Portugal for the rebels, as well as the ambiguity of Britain's attitude. In short, what is manifested in this civil war is that the clear demarcation between the world's peace front and aggression front is clearly visible.</p>
<p>According to telegrams, the result of this "civil war" is that the number of deaths has reached 175,000. Of course, by now it is probably around 200,000. This number of deaths is quite alarming, but the Spanish people's courageous resistance to evil forces has great value. First, it has made the people of the world recognize the vicious faces of the aggressors; second, the influence of peace on the people of all countries who love peace is very profound from what they have seen in this Spanish civil war.</p>
<p>As for us Chinese people, who are currently suffering from the invasion of a powerful enemy, we naturally hate the aggressors immensely. At the same time, we can also find our allies of "enemy or friend?" from this Spanish civil war.</p>
<h3>Smart Audience</h3>
<p>— Fan Jia</p>
<p>There was a time when I really liked watching the so-called "continuous stage new dramas" popular in Shanghai. These new dramas had beautiful sets, amazing mechanisms, and bizarre plots. The ending of each play always left the audience in suspense. For example, could the "adult" escape danger? Could the grievances of the "young master and young lady" be brought to light? Why didn't the "local tyrant" receive justice? However, the next new play still didn't explain it, and "cases" happened one after another, making the "adults" extremely anxious to go to the dilapidated temple to "seek dreams." As a result, the audience's hearts were always tightly drawn in, and the theater's business was so good that you had to reserve seats a few days in advance.</p>
<p>But after watching many, I discovered a major key, that is, in every new drama, it was the local tyrant who was causing trouble. He falsely accused good people, forcibly robbed women, did everything, and spared nothing. The "good people" suffered everywhere. Although the "adult's" subordinates had many capable heroes, they were still often in a hurry.</p>
<p>Understanding this key, I stopped watching the continuous stage new dramas. It seemed too stupid to spend a lot of money to make the playwright laugh.</p>
<p>Recently, I watched a few "continuous stage new dramas" again. The reason was not that I wanted to be a "fool." I wanted to see the actor who played the "local tyrant." After so long, the sets and mechanisms have greatly improved, and a scene-stealing method called "Dark Change" has been invented. For example, what was clearly a good scene of a "wedding night" was transformed into a "grand exercise" on a bandit mountain in a few seconds of darkness. All of this made the audience "feel both sadness and joy!" However, the actors' acting skills are still sticking to the old ways. This is the reason why I went to see "continuous stage new dramas" again. I really love the actor who plays the "local tyrant." This is of course my prejudice. Because as soon as he appears on stage, he has a white-painted face to tell the audience that he is not a "good guy." His actions and words are so bad that they make people angry. Isn't there a joke that a woodcutter watching "Cao Cao Forcing the Palace" was so "fired up" that he ran onto the stage and chopped the actor who played Cao Cao? Later generations all thought that the actor was too hardworking and acted too realistically. I didn't agree with this statement. Who has ever seen a "local tyrant" with a white-painted face, clearly expressing his "identity" in an "extremely ferocious" way? "Acting too realistically," I just found it funny, so I loved the actor who played the "local tyrant."</p>
<p>However, whether you run onto the stage or just find it funny, everyone except the actors is clearly a "fool." If one day the actor who plays the "local tyrant" dresses up as a fair-faced scholar, shaking a paper fan, pacing, and acting like a hypocrite, then the woodcutter will be a smart audience.</p>
<h3>On the Steep Gate Line</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>——Haiyan Miscellaneous——</p>
<p>It wasn't dawn yet when Old He came knocking on the door. Today we were going to cross the bay of the South China Sea to Steep Gate, which looked like a mountain country. The journey was thirty li, so we had to start early. The two of us set off southwest in the faint morning dew. The countryside in the morning was so lovely. The sea breeze blowing from the sea rushed into our hearts in gusts. I love the countryside, the fresh air of the countryside can heal my depressed mood. At that time, the fishermen and woodcutters I saw along the way, the farmers carrying hoes, and the distant mountains and rivers formed a beautiful painting of nature. These had already made me feel infinitely gratified. Yes, in Shanghai, in other cities, where can you breathe in such good air?</p>
<p>After passing Wencun, there were still more than ten li to Hengshan. However, here I felt the desolation of a vast wilderness. This area is all farmland along the coast. In the late autumn of previous years, you could always see endless stretches of rice fields. The green rice straw and the flowering spikes swayed in the gentle sea breeze, countless and endless, and that light and graceful wind would quietly think of the farmers' joy. However, this year's flood disaster before the Mid-Autumn Festival swallowed up thousands upon thousands of green rice paddies, leaving nothing behind, nothing worth cherishing, only the endlessly sad red fields covered by the ruthless white clouds.</p>
<p>Although rice was still growing in the relatively high fields, it could not withstand the scorching sun. The field surfaces were cracking, and it looked pitiful, with no harvest in sight. Looking along the way, I could still see the bloodstains of those who had died in the disaster. According to Old He, this area was nothing compared to the village of Jiaoqi, where more than 1,300 people died and nine out of ten of the hundred or so small villages collapsed. Not only was there no rice, but the fields were covered in thick bloodstains. Although two months had passed since the disaster and the corpses had been collected, the stench of blood still lingered in the sea breeze, and the situation in the deserted village of Jiaoqi was more than a hundred times worse than here. — This made my heart beat nervously. Even in the villages along the way, I could see the houses that had been washed away by the water, with more than one-tenth of the losses in each village, and in the fields I could see the traces left by the dead. I thought that tomorrow, when I returned from Steep Gate, I would conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the "flood disaster" for a theme. There would definitely be something worth grieving over, but also satisfying.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Hengshan, Hengshan was at the corner of the South China Sea. In front of the mountain was the sea, and there were no other connected mountain ranges. The scenery was beautiful. The high peaks were full of green bushes, and the locals called it "Pig Mountain." However, according to feng shui, the opposite side of this mountain across the sea is Lion Mountain and Tiger Mountain, so Hengshan has never been prosperous. In the past, a scholar traveled here and wrote, "Incomparable adversity, the mountain alone remains." This is a very famous place.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the seaside, we called for a small boat, and for the price of six jiao of silver, we raised the sails and gently floated on the calm sea, welcoming the wind. Here, we could see the vast expanse of white on the sea. Yai Mountain and Yaimen, where Lu Xiufu carried the emperor and plunged into the sea, were not far from here. There are often big storms here, so sailors are very frightened. This area was where the emperors of the late Song Dynasty moved to, so most of the people with the surname Zhao still use this bit of history as conversation material, which is also a distinctive harvest for me when I came to Haiyan.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Steep Gate, in the past when there were many thieves, this area served as the main camp for giant thieves, because transportation here was inconvenient, and the large mountain ranges were connected far away. After another thirty or forty li of rugged mountain roads, we reached the border of Yangjiang County, a poor country. The people were so uncivilized. From the customs of these people, I could see crude characteristics that I had never seen before.</p>
<p>Before arriving at Steep Gate, I didn't have a deep impression of the customs of the remote countryside. Now, a strong feudal atmosphere, which I secretly feared, is deeply engraved in my mind — this distinctive seaside mountain country!</p>
<h3>Letter from Someone</h3>
<p>— Someone</p>
<p>It's raining outside the window, I can't sleep, so I think of you, and want to write a few words to tell you about my recent situation.</p>
<p>For the past week, I've been insomniac every night, and I can only fall asleep when it's dawn. Why? I can't say myself.</p>
<p>Is it because of loneliness? I used to think so, but I can't feel it now. I've gotten used to being lonely, and I even find loneliness endearing. Letting a person spend a long night locked in a small room, flipping through books and newspapers, and smoking cigarettes, is sometimes more interesting than being in a brightly lit and lively place.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not willing to live in loneliness either, but there are many people in brightly lit and lively places who harbor a sense of loneliness; when I go home at midnight and see the lonely bright moon, it makes me even more uncomfortable, so it's better to stay at home and flip through books and newspapers. Therefore, although I often go to seek stimulation because I'm too impulsive, the result of seeking stimulation is deeper pain rather than numbness. Therefore, I often regret it, but I often give myself the bitter fruit of regret to taste.</p>
<p>Today, I came back after tasting the bitter fruit of regret again.</p>
<p>Now, that singing woman is here again. She has a hoarse voice, but she tries her best to make it sharp, so her singing is not singing at all, but screaming, and screaming so hard.</p>
<p>Friend, I'll stop writing. I want to quietly listen to the screaming of that person who has fallen to the ends of the earth, and from her screaming, I want to find out the extent of her anger.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is my perverted habit? Yes, this may be my perverted habit, because it can touch my heartstrings. I think her song is the most beautiful. But perhaps, from her singing, I can understand what I should do as an individual in the future.</p>
<p>There are too many things I want to say, but I can't say them. Goodbye.</p>
<p>The rain is getting heavier.</p>

<h3>The Life Story of Sai Jinhua (Continued)</h3>
<p>Because the German Minister Ketteler was captured and killed by the Boxers, it caused the Eight-Nation Alliance to attack Beijing. At this time, Beijing was truly in a state of chaos. All that was seen were foreigners killing and setting fires everywhere. Sai Jinhua planned to take refuge, but was tied up by an officer under the command of the Allied Forces. As a result, she met the commander of the Allied Forces, Waldersee. This General Waldersee turned out to be a good friend whom Sai Jinhua had met when she was the wife of the German Minister in Germany. Therefore, she lived in the Yiluan Hall of the Empress Dowager Cixi's palace.</p>
<p>At that time, Sai Jinhua took advantage of the panic caused by the Allied Forces' food shortage and proposed conditions to the Allied Forces to stop killing and setting fires in Beijing, promising to purchase military food for the Allied Forces. In this way, it is truly unknown how many people in Beijing were saved.</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang's negotiations with Waldersee felt very troublesome. As long as he could fight for the personal face of the Empress Dowager Cixi, he was willing to agree to all conditions, but Mrs. Ketteler of Germany wanted the Chinese Empress Dowager to apologize to her. This negotiation was difficult. The key to the problem was all on Waldersee, but who could speak to him? At this time, the confident Lord Li Zhongtang completely entrusted the responsibility of solving the problem to Sai Jinhua. Sai Jinhua persuaded the Ketteler's people, agreed to Waldersee's three major demands (this was naturally Li Hongzhang's opinion), and handled the negotiation properly. The Empress Dowager Cixi benefited from her and returned to Beijing.</p>
<p>Some officials who gained fame by following foreigners and running dogs were promoted, but everyone forgot Sai Jinhua's contribution and envied her. What about Sai Jinhua? After Waldersee left, she did not receive the Empress Dowager Cixi's reward and continued to run a brothel. Because of a murder case in the brothel, those officials who envied him took the opportunity to add the crime of "injuring customs and morals and abusing people to death." Sai Jinhua's property was confiscated and sold, and she was escorted back to her hometown and was not allowed to live in Beijing again.</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua was extremely resentful and said, "See how majestic you are for a few days? Now Sai Jinhua still lives in Beiping. Recently, we saw in the newspaper that Han Fuqu, the chairman of Shandong Province, gave her a subsidy of 100 national currency yuan. But what about those officials who were majestic at the time? (The End)</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Beside the Huangpu River"</h3>
<h3>Bai Yushuang's New Play</h3>
<p>"Romance of the West Chamber" is scheduled to be staged on the 12th</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang has been singing at the Empire Theater for more than a year, and she seems to be becoming more and more popular. Previously, she rehearsed the play "Pan Jinlian" and sang it dozens of times in a row, and the box office remained strong. Now, after "Pan Jinlian," she has chosen another "Romance of the West Chamber," from the Old Madam opening the spring courtyard, Zhang Junrui visiting the Buddhist temple, to Zhang Junrui bidding farewell to Yingying, and the reunion dream at the Caoqiao Inn, collecting the great achievements of nine Kunqu operas and adapting them. In the play, Bai Yushuang plays Hongniang, and Xiao Bai Yushuang plays Yingying. It is now scheduled to premiere on the night of the 12th. This [illegible character] shadow is a recent photo of Bai Yushuang, known as the "Oriental Mei [illegible character] Si."</p>
