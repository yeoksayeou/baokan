<h3 id="c41">現階段的　日本軍需工業資本漫畫（上） <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>在「軍備　充」的在浪中，日本的軍需工業資本家和軍部發愁起來了。「金屬材料不足」，「資源地太少了」，——喊呌着！接着是——「製鐵國策」，「石油國策」，「石炭液體化國策」……種種國策都發生了。綜合這些國策的，是「大陸國第」。若不佔領廣大的資源地，那便甚麽國策也是貧弱的。</p>
<p>這不但是日本，意德諸資本主義國都差不多，只是日本特別呌得慌罷了。</p>
<p>輸入！只靠一年年的軍需原料品輸入，那不是根本辦法。要做到原料自給，那非有豐富的資源地不可。</p>
<p>在討論資源地的時候，最受讃美的當然是山西的煤礦，陝西的石油等等。雖然華北的「中日經濟合作」已經開始，龍烟煤礦也已興辦，但從開發以至取得，還是需要時日的。現在且來檢査日本軍需工業的原料現狀吧。</p>
<p>日本能够生產的軍需原料如下：</p>
<p>金，銀，銅，鐵，錫，鉛，亞鉛，水銀，硫黃，黃化鐵，石炭，石油，及其他。</p>
<p>日本內地和台灣朝鮮的總產額，以歐洲大戰時爲最活躍。一九一七年的總產額爲六億八千萬元。但至戰後的十年間，產量减少了——只不過在二億至三億元之間。一九三一年末，所謂「金輸出再禁止」以來，又才開始活躍。一九三五年的產額，達五億元，但仍未趕上一九一七年的數量。</p>
<p>卽使每年能保持五億元的礦物生產吧，這仍舊是不够供給的。何况還有許多軍需工業中不能缺的礦，日本不能大量生產。目前固然是在積極開發所謂的「滿洲國」，但因「滿洲國」的義勇軍閙的很兇，國際情勢又這樣緊張，一部份金融資本家也有點畏縮投資。同時，日本政府方面一時也拿不出許多金錢來。——就是政府本身曾經許可投給「滿鐵」的資金，經過滿鐵社長松岡到東京來交涉了，目前也還不見痛痛快快的付出，這就使僞國的礦產不能急速開發。卽使開發，也很要等些時日纔能用。所以礦物的輸入不但不能緩，並且爲保障「大陸政策」的實現，「軍備擴充」所必要的原料輸入，也只有一天比一天更增加。這也就是說，日本的「資源國策」，尚未完全建立起來。</p>
<p>現在先檢討日本三年來的礦產額吧（下表單位百萬元）：</p>
<p>（上表據日本確山局調査，但朝鮮產量及「八幡製鐵再製銑鐵所」之礦產額未包含在內）。</p>
<p>看上表，可知最近三年來的日本礦產額都在增加着。一九三四年比一九三三年增七千七百餘萬元。一九三五年比一九三四年增七千二百餘萬元。產量最多的，第一是石炭，第二是銅。這裏應該注意的是——在軍需工業上最重要的鐵和石油，都產的很少。一九三三年的鐵產額，只不過一千八百七十萬元，石油八百九十萬元。雖然一九三四，三五年的產額都增加不少，但需要增加的比例還更高。除了鐵和石油，是談不上軍需工業發展的，海軍部提出的新的「建艦計劃，」陸軍部提出的「增設軍備，「「增設航空機，「擴大在滿兵力，」這些都非有大量的鐵和石油不可。就把最近的日本輸人統計表拿來看吧，從十一月一日至十日間，僅僅十日，只鐵的輸入便佔五百六十八萬三千元，原油及重油佔二百二十七萬五千元。這輸入並不是偶然的，是有計劃的。細査今年的日本貿易，可知日本是有計劃的盡量輸入鐵與原油及重油逼類的軍需原料。</p>
<p>現在再來看最近三年間輸入日本的礦產額（單位百萬元）：</p>
<p>（據外國貿易表。）</p>
<p>這便可以看出日本礦產物的輸入是逐年增加的。當然因爲日本軍需工業的需要逐年增加，輸入也纔逐年增加的。軍需工業的擴充，這不消說，小學生也知道是戰爭準備的更積極了。</p>
<p>每年的日本輸入貿易，平均的在二十五億上下。總輸入的增加率（有時在减少）遠不如礦物輸入的增加率。各種輸入品中，除棉花而外，鐵常佔第一位——尤其今年。其决爲原油及重油。</p>
<p>日本的輸出品，最主要的還是輕工業生產品。今舉日本最重要的輪出品八種於下：</p>
<p>小麥粉，罐頭食料，棉紗，生絲，綿織物（布疋類）絲織物，人造絲織物，梅亞里斯製品，上記八品，沒有一種不是輕工業的生產品。一小部份機械類的重工業生產品，其市塲也大半只能達到日本的殖民地，半殖民地。</p>

<h3 id="c42">國際危機中的英國 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>希特勒墨索里尼和日本當局所指望的是什麽。早已由他們自己口中供鰓出來。他們自己的行動表現出來了。在遭受侵略。或老有遭受侵略的危險的諸國。能够結成共同陣綫。以牙還牙。以眼還眼。以高射砲對飛機。以而罩擋毒瓦斯。固然是最適當而最高明的辦法。然而建立和平共同陣綫。談何容易。譬如英國是足以左右世界政洽形勢的。可是英國保守黨人。明知道侵略陣錢的結成。足以危害世界和平。却還是抱牢過去陳腐的外交政策。而毫不改變。英國外相艾登本月一日在國際商會分會雖則鄭重其事地演說。「比利時如果未經挑景而受他國侵略。英國卽當出而援助。」一若對於大陸事件很是關心。事實上可又不然。德國的外交家看透了英國的衷曲。曉得了英國保守黨人的短視。只要德國不觸犯英人的利益。英國是樂得不問德國的自由行動的。因此。在德日恊定發表以後。德國爲要消除英國人的疑慮。馬上電達英政府保證。說「德日協定。並無秘密條欵。」而英國保守黨喉舌的郵報也說。「德日協定。毫無震耳之點。一句話說。這不外一種互相提携。以遏制共產國際惡意的活動吧了。」輕描淡寫的幾句話。把侵略者的罪惡一筆勾銷。這樣的態度。說保守黨有同氣相求的傾向也可以。說保守黨只圖目前苟安。沒有遠大的目光也可以。</p>
<p>我們知道。保守黨的唯一目的。不在如何消弭戰爭。而在如何使英國不牽入戰爭。準保守黨新工黨官僚前首相麥唐納曾發表談話說。「維讓東歐現狀並不是我們的急務。我們所須謹防的。乃是牽入因法國與德國東鄰（指蘇聯）有結合而引起的戰爭。」這幾句話把保守黨外交的全貌一絲不遺的呈現在我們的面前。本月一日外相艾登的在下院對德日恊定的意見說。「英國對該協定的態度。是在反對將世界分爲數集團的趨勢。尤其爲思想上的原因而出此。英國政策仍以增進各國間的友誼爲主旨。」也是他們所抱的敗北主義的具體說明。</p>
<p>英國因爲要避免牽入戰爭漩渦。因爲要增進所謂各國間的友誼。所以所希望的。只是西歐的區域安全。德國能够順著英國這一點企望。而保障比利時的中立。保守黨卽已覺得滿意。對於德國種種破壞條約的舉動。自可裝聾作啞。不加聞問。這是英國對付德國的態度。至於地中海上最近崛起的另一個有野心的國家——意大利。它那種暴發戶的氣勢。在意阿戰爭中。已令英人不安。可是在不妨碍英國利益而同時可使英國避免牽入戰爭這大前提下。英意也不是沒有妥協餘地的。我們又看到倫敦羅馬之間關於地中海問題。有君子恊定提出了。</p>
<p>英國雖至今日。顯然還是在政路上彷徨着。然而世事的演變。總會使英國警覺到非下决心不可的。著名學者拉斯基最近說過。「資本主義的衡突卽是侵略的戰爭。這事實明顯地包含在法西强國政策之內。要使我們（指英國人）跳出戰爭以外。是一種妄想。唯一防制戰爭的方法。只有與那些無侵略野心的强國聯合。而給法西强國一種警告。那就是他們如果要用武力來改變邊境。就將與我們及我們的聯盟國家的武力周旋。」這幾句話。我們認爲不但可作英國保守黨人的藥石。並且對於正受侵略國家的人民。也可作一種座右銘。</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪况之三十九）</p>
<p>本月份本市工商業異動情形，表面上忽呈顯著之景氣現象；新創者達五二家，開本年來各月之最高紀錄，閉歇者僅較上月份增一家，亦能保持六月以後徐徐下降之優勢，然吾人一窺其內容，則立可發見此種畸形之繁榮，乃係最近大批所謂「嚮導社」之出現所使然，觀乎製造工業之疲備不起與販賣業之逐步衰退，依然爲市塲繁榮之重大阻碍。然以本年情形與去年同期相對照，則今年本市工商業實戶較去年情形轉好不少矣。計本月份新剏者五二家，擴充者十三家，收縮三家，改組者二一〇家，閉歇者五九家，如與過去兩月及去年同期相比則如次：</p>
<p>新創　擴充　收縮　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>二五年七月　三四　二〇　二二　一三〇　七一</p>
<p>八月　二七　一六　九　二三五　五八</p>
<p>九月　五二　一三　三　二一〇　五九</p>
<p>二四年九月　二五　—　—　二二一　八</p>
<p>本月份新創者較上月份增二五家，較去年同期增二七家。擴充者料上月份减三家。收縮者較上月份减六家。改組者較上月份减二五家，較去年同期减一一家。閉歇者料上月份增一家，較去年同期减二五家。本月份各數字於各業間之分佈如下：</p>
<p>新創　擴充　收縮　改組　閉歇</p>
<p>特種事業　二九　五　一　六七　一三</p>
<p>製造工業　七　二　一　三三　一〇</p>
<p>販賣商業　一六　六　一　一一〇　三六</p>
<p>合計　五二　一三　三　一二〇　五九</p>
<p>特種事業類新創者較上月份增二〇家，閉歇者料上月份减一八家，可謂鮮有之現象，其原因卽係嚮導社之陸續出現，已如前述，蓋市面不振，各業蕭條，因此昔日之「書寓」之類，爲適應環境與潮流計，其資力較大者多轉變爲舞塲，資金較弱者則紛紛改頭換面，羣以「嚮導」相召號矣。本月份特種事業中之金融業較爲靜寂，其他各業異動中較重要者計有下列數家：</p>
<p>（一）六國飯店停業淸理　該店原係前全家福西菜社及大陸飯店遞嬗改組而成，方於本年七月開幕營業，經理顧遠龍君，協理勵永慶君，開業之際，卽因市面不景氣影響營業不振，卒致內部職員携貳，股東意見紛歧，協理勵君甚至携所有帳簿票據現欵等出走，以致無法營業，不得已宣告停業淸理。</p>
<p>（二）金蘭協記食品公司淸理召盤　該公司前名金蘭飯店食品公司，規模頗宏，於粵幫中堪稱巨擘之一。開業以來已逾二載，初時營業頗盛，聲譽遂著，惟近因市面寥落，生涯一落千丈，後轉輾出讓，於本年三月底改組爲金蘭協記食品公司，但市面蕭條如故，營業仍無起色，以致虧融頗鉅，延至本月十日，卒因無法維持，宣告淸理召盤，聞人欠欠人，尚可互抵云。（未完）</p>

<p>淋病指迷</p>
<h3 id="c151">患了淋病以後將怎樣處置 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 日本帝大醫科畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>……淋病在沒有根本治愈前不能接觸異性此爲道　德上所應遵守　……在治療期間應絕對持續一貫的療法以斬除淋毒根株而全治</p>
<p>都市愈發達，患性病的人也就愈多。所以都市中的性病，較城鎭爲繁盛又較鄉村爲甚。這就是因爲都市里生活程度高，娶妻的事沒有鄉間容易。一方又因爲娼妓的發達，一些變相的娛樂場所，層出不窮，性病的流行也是必然的結果。</p>
<p>在性病當中，梅毒因了已有六〇六特效藥的發明，已經是很易於解决的了。此外如軟性下疳也因爲療法的妥善，所以都不成問題。只有淋病這個症候，是一向被醫學界認爲難治的。這原因就由於沒有特效藥。如從前曾一度風行的黃色素療法，也早就風流雲散的了。據經過許多學者的研究，黃色素的質料本不純粹，除了配用蛋白體外，是不能免除流弊的。</p>
<p>淋病旣然是如此難治，那末當患了淋病以後，將怎樣處置？在急性的時候，尿道流出膿汁，龜頭腫痛，包皮往上翻脹，而小便困難，每每使患者號呌不已。這時設若誤治，那末便將變成慢性，引起睪丸炎症（腎囊腫大），攝護腺炎症，膀胱炎症。不幸傳染給妻子，使她罹患白帶，子宮爛蝕。造成了兩性不能生育。而且多年淋病，每每引起關節炎，四肢殘廢，若是併發淋毒性心膜炎，那眞命懸旦夕，危不可言了。</p>
<p>還好，二十世紀是個科學世紀，許多疾病在以前被認爲難治，現在却靠了科學而得到解决的途徑了。如淋病之用蛋白體配合黃色素的製劑，實在是近世科學的最大成績！這個製劑就是畢德博士首創的「克淋儂」。此藥所含的黃色素因爲配合了蛋白體，所以毫沒副作用，而有消炎鎭痛的特效了爲任何黃色素製劑所不及。故淋病無論男女急性慢性服之，效騐奇偉。尤其以本藥中的蛋白體，功能喚起血中的抗淋素，並增加血內白血球，以猛力撲滅淋菌，故淋病者服之，無論如何保證斷根！</p>
<p>如能同時外用「抗淋水」洗滌尿道（女子白帶可洗滌陰道），更能迅速收功。</p>
<p>淋病服「克淋儂」斷根者，簡直無法統計，歐美各國報章上所載讚揚本藥文字，觸目皆是。凡不含蛋白體之合製淋劑，槪係僞藥，購時務須認明眞正「克淋儂」三字。以免服後危險。</p>
<p>性的故事</p>
<h3 id="c152">春宵一刻值千金　新婚前夜之準備 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>……自凟患者及早覺悟　……勿虛度可憐的良宵</p>
<p>兩性的愛情，根基於性慾，但此種性慾，須得正當之發洩，如身體發育不全，未滿足結婚年齡，，卽濫行性的行爲，則靑春腺勢必半途停止發育，荷爾蒙的分泌機能，因以不足。於是下部陷於發育不全之境地。同時因性機能之减下，輸精管與射精管，皆鬆弛不固，又因性神經衰弱，而不能鞏固精關，，遂有遺精早洩勃起力不能等症。現在因世風日下，靑年無知而患此性的自凟者甚多，一般父母不知兒子之隱疾，强迫結婚。當彼新婚之夜，爲兩性結合之時，其光陰之可貴，一如蘇東坡所說「春宵一刻值千金」也。然而因了性機能的不振，不能效於飛之樂。所以往往有在新婚之夜，卽種下不良惡影響，離婚之兆，亦種於此。</p>
<p>我們從根本上去解决，自然首得戒除自凟惡癖，同時補給已損失之荷爾蒙，促性機能之旺盛而使發育健全。余自俄國勞働大學醫科畢業以來，懸壺問世，補給荷爾蒙最有效之內服劑以「補體康」一藥，，功效最爲偉大持久，茲記一例如下，有住辣斐德路丁乃礽君，素有手淫惡習，發育不全，性神經衰弱之病。初次與金女士結婚，未二月而離異，其離原因爲性神經衰弱，而表面托言他故，但其父母不知也。因而又爲代訂蕭姓女。丁君因懷於過去之失，急商於余，乞爲治療，乃囑其進服大量「補體康」以補給荷爾蒙，使性組織復趨强化。更用「耐而斯遺精片」同服，以鎭固精關，前後計六星期而愈，下部發育健全，婚後伉儷愛情十分濃厚，從未有勃谿之事發生云。</p>
<p>醫林叢話</p>
<h3 id="c153">歐洲醫學界極力推崇之：肺癆病的淋巴　鬱積療法 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>五十年來……醫學界僅有之最大貢獻</p>
<p>肺癆病之療法，古今來不知瀝盡學者幾許心血，而終苦無一確切妥善之方法，或則以增加肺之活力爲主要，或則偏重於增加肺部石灰質（結締細胞），其料爲新穎可靠者則有臟器療法；皆近年來醫學界所認爲相當重要之問題！而議論紛紜，莫衷一是，要皆只能聊備一說，非眞正有絕對功效之療法也。故肺癆仍可謂爲無根本辦法。</p>
<p>自一八八二年Forlanini氏發明人工氣胸術Kunstlicher　Pneumothorad後，此種使患側肺弛綏之方法，乃以最新態度確立其治療界之地位。因此增加結締細胞及臟器療法皆被全部打倒，而「淋巴鬱積」之學說遂被肺病專家所汎用矣。今日肺科手術中之胸廓形成術及橫膈膜神經切除術，皆根據此學理而發明者</p>
<p>查此項淋巴鬱積療法，乃係使患側肺弛綏，因而縮小其血行及淋巴行，空洞得以縮小，愈着亦藉此消失，遂得迅速將肺癆治愈。此近日各國醫院氣胸術之成績所以奏效優異也。</p>
<p>今有根據淋巴鬱積作用學理而發明之內服「補肺拿爾」製劑，服後有確實治療癆病之能力。凡不能施行氣胸等手術之癆病人，服此藥卽獲美滿功效。自服「補肺拿爾」後，則咳嗽，胸痛，痰多，均見霍然！而咯血停止，潮熱淸退，食慾增加，皆爲服本劑後之特有良效。且藥性王道，毫無不良刺激，極便於自療。各國肺病醫師，無不一致讚賞此項淋巴鬱積療法焉！</p>

<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>靑春是女子的黃金時代，但是他很容易逝去的·靑春一旦逝去，女子的悲哀也就開始了。我們應該怎樣去保持他，挽救他？這是早衰女性所亟待解决的問題。</p>
<p>原來女子的靑春腺，是女子最重要的器官，我們保持靑春，自然要恢復靑春腺的健全。許多女子因爲靑春腺——卵巢機能的機搆不健全，月經的困難，小腹膨脹，刺痛，或腰重如垂，白帶下，各種臟器，亦因月經不調，神經衰弱。內分泌工作怠慢，一切營養失去供給。故使肌肉鬆弛，面色萎黃也。</p>
<p>欲挽救此等症狀先當服「補女容」矯卵巢機能，使排卵機能正常，則月經調整。同時新陳代謝機能卽可旺盛。使肌肉細膩，紅潤，妍態綽約，將靑春喚回，一切恢復常態。余自陸軍醫科大學畢業以來，卽用「補女容」一藥治愈早衰女性者，爲數甚夥。如有白帶者，可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，以滌淸白帶。</p>
<h3 id="c155">被劣藥所殘留之淋疾 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>患者莫愛棠君，年廿三歲，居蒲柏路，因同事之嬲，涉足平康，遂染淋毒，當時曾由某醫生治療，除爲之施行非法手術外，並介某種成藥，服至三星期，外表病勢雖已减却許多，但反有嘔吐及小便艱濇，尿後見血，淋絲如絮，蓋已成慢性膀胱炎矣。去歲經由友人鄂南溪君之介紹，來余處醫治，經用科學方法檢騐後，見其第三器中甚爲混濁，更用此種尿液用放大顯微鏡檢查，見有無數淋菌，附粘於淋絮（見甲圖）乃囑服德國彼得氏三十餘年研究所得之「克淋儂」，一方外用抗淋水洗滌尿道，前後未服四星期，尿液已告澄淸，惟再用顯微鏡檢查，則尿中尚有少許之淋系存在，知尚未斷根也。仍囑服「克淋儂」至一星期餘，再行檢騐，已無淋菌踪跡。惟爲愼重起見又用抽血檢查，仍無淋毒反應云（乙圖係抽騐之血液。）</p>
<h3 id="c156">（甲圖） <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>

<p>服「克淋儂」後，淋菌已完全絶跡。圖係從患者抽出檢騐之血液。</p>

<p>— 陳少華醫師</p>
<p>婦女白帶，雖說是一種最普遍的病，但確也是一種最使女性難堪。因爲膣內恒因分泌液之侵蝕，不僅沾汚衣褲，又能沾染細菌而成大患。如子宮出血，小腹膨脹，月經亦因之不調，凡此，都是不孕的原因，又凡是有白帶病的，眼的四圈，都有灰暗色的黑圈，對於美容上實是致命傷。所以我們對白帶病加以急緊治療。也就是對美容上根本加以改造。</p>
<p>「卡而雪地陰道片」一藥，富有殺菌止泌防腐的功效。爲治白帶病的最適應的外用坐藥，且可在家自己治療。不論遠年新起，均可於短期內治愈之，惟因淋毒而起者，可兼服「克淋儂」以除淋菌，因白帶而引起月經困難者可兼服「補女容」，則厥疾自愈。</p>

<p>淋毒性精囊炎之挽救</p>
<p>淋毒性精囊炎，爲最易傷戕性神經而致衰弱的淋病。因爲此種症狀最易刺戟生殖器部分。在急慢性時期均見之，茲以慢性精囊炎之證狀而言，其症狀爲從鄰接臟器而來之各種症狀。爲直腸，尿道，及會陰等處之疼痛與刺戟，其放散之疼痛，延及兩腿及背部，後尿道與副生殖器之疾患，有膀胱刺戟症；尤其膀胱痙孿，其最易常見者，爲慢性精囊炎時之精液漏Spematorrhoe患者在一度房事後，其精虫在數日間完全消失。又射精管恒因精囊炎與輸精管炎症之關係，以致射精管閉鎖不全，往往於排尿或大便時而漏出精液。</p>
<p>患者林茂言君，素有手淫惡癖，後患淋病，此惡癖仍繼續不斷，性神經益見損害，突起精囊炎，嗣又以調治失宜，劣藥誤服，以至病勢惡化，呈遺精漏精之症。尿道會陰等處作有刺戟性之疼痛，兩足亦受影響而不良於行。精神委頓，面如黃蠟，頻呼頭痛眼藥。岌岌不可終日，後乃由其同學方敏中君之介紹，乞余療治，蓋確已呈精囊炎症之精液漏矣。用顯微鏡檢查精液，內中已無精虫之踪跡。此爲男性不姙之主要原因，乃用長短電波交互治療外，更囑向太和藥房購服「克淋儂」，俾於服後於短期內，全體細胞，發生抗淋毒素，將散居精囊及輸精管等處之淋菌，徹底剷除，復用「補體康」以改造性組織，俾復趨於完整。在五星期中淋毒已徹底根治。其精囊漏症，亦得「補體康」之塡補而規復正常，並促生新的精細胞，在三星期後已有精虫再生。故林君於病愈後之第八個月，卽行結婚，婚後一年而獲一子。</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>世界各個國家，都有着英雄美人的佳話流傳着。似乎英雄所愛的是美人，而美人的伴侶，也必然是英雄了！</p>
<p>其實美人不必美，英雄也不是戰上的武士。只要有健碩的體格，雄武的英姿，這個人必有成爲女性們所愛慕的可能。</p>
<p>運動家之爲女子熱烈的追求，其原因却在於性的滿足之獲得；所以「嫁給勇士吧」的歌聲，實在是每個女子內心的共鳴。</p>
<p>當男子失去健碩的體力時，同時也失去駕駑妻子的本能這種本能的低弱，卽是神經衰弱症的形成。如遺精夢精，早洩，勃起力不壯，快感麻木，有的甚而陰萎。其根本原因都是當靑年春機發動期，受劣友或淫書之引誘，手淫過多。或者婚後因房勞過度，摧殘了性器。對於性神經衰弱的療治，除了服用荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」外，沒有其他最好的方法。因爲「補體康」是用勇壯動物如猩猩獅虎海狗等的睪丸精靑春腺一類的珍貴荷爾蒙製成；能夠壯補神經，而對於陰萎早洩，不能生育，性器短小，及因手淫遺精而起之神經衰弱失眠頭痛，思想呆鈍，記憶力銳减等症，效力特別宏大。爲一切類似的臟器製劑所不及！如遺精夢洩，漏精滑精可同時服「耐而斯遺精片」更有良效！</p>

<p>麥昨日期麥市、上午開盤、各月份又復激昂、因洋麥報價、美坎兩處、上落無幾、利物浦則激漲二三辨士、國際形勢日益嚴重、故稍寂之人心、又復重振、各月份之開價、較前日均漲五六分、至一角零、迨至下午開盤、因粉市仍趨漲勢、業外微有購進、較上午又好二三四分不等、現麥市面、因標準大振、喊價亦步步高昂、較前日又漲一角、開山東麥六元四角半、蚌埠麥六元四角、海州麥六元三角七分、廣東麥六元二角揚州麥六元三角半、漢口麥六元一角半、紹興麥六元三角二分、平湖麥五元九角半、蕪湖麥六元角七分、由申大辦一千包、福新辦三千包、阜豐辦二千包云、</p>

<p>昨日客秈到頭仍旺、由長江各埠裝到萬餘包、市面本居平軟、惟昨本客去化轉旺、且有少數囤戶問訊、本街實銷亦貪、客帮則以汕頭爲主、其他各帮仍多難望、但本銷轉旺後、疲弱之巾面已被撑住、全日開出贛米七千包、湘米一千多包、溫甬米八百五十包、江北米二百包、總計九千多包、汕顯辦去二千包、其餘盡由本街收進、行情大致與前市相似、而人心已見帶起云、</p>

<p>近日芝蔴巿況、洋莊雖無顯明交易、但巿勢依然堅硬、故現貨毛蔴仍堅、云路近得紹興帮及榨油銷塲蓬勃、且來源仍少、故其市氣有榮無辱、昨計該帮辦去穎州黃蔴二百二十四包、臨淮關黃蔴四百五十餘包、大利集黃蔴三百餘包、尚有廣帮成交膂店雪蔴九十五包、價爲十一元三角五分云、</p>

<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>路易虛在他的地中海周游記的一開頭就說：「終於把陸上生活拋在後頭了，那一切擾攘的人事，嘈雜的喧囂。雖然到船上還不過一刻鐘，而船也只不過是浮着的旅館，也竟使人奇怪怎麼以前耳目口鼻，能把陸上生活忍受得那樣久。」海洋固然具有偉大，深沉，變幻，驚險等等誘引人的魅力，但去海上的人，爲海的魅力所吸引去的，大概也不比爲陸上的魔力所壓迫去的爲多。現在海洋是鍍全本者的通路，却沒有聽見那一個鍍金人愛了海。海不想去黃金國度的人的愛物，且幾乎是一種障礙。而愛海的人，却幷不想由海的通路去到黃金國度，而反希望有一隻載着他「永遠浮漂於海上而不靠海口」的鬼船，讓他永遠離開陸地。如果限制他非有一個到着地不可，他或者只希望有一個未知的國度。從前我們的世界是廣闊的，海上的流人，往往可以得着他們的發現的新地。雖然新地一轉瞬也就變成舊世界的勢力所及，新土地上到底還有較自由的呼吸，具有叛逆性的被壓迫者，仍不斷地願意到海外去。北美洲還曾由一些叛逆者終久造成了一個國家。中國人在南洋本來也可以演相類的故事的，大概因爲到着新土地後，不曾需要不斷的抗爭，日久恢復所謂中國人的和平美德，在忽然侵入的西方勢力下低了頭。這之後，賸下一個中國海的虛名，實際我們失去了海洋。雖說近年來那些地方，也還曾經做過一些被壓逼下海去的人的歸着地，那些已只是狹小的世界的一隅，不再是浮海者所希望的到着地。我們算是知道了整個世界而道個世界實在太狹小，至少被住在這上面一部份人類弄成一個狹小的樣子。事實上旣不能有一個永遠不靠海口的鬼船，而又無法選擇一個比較近理想的海口，到處是一樣的陸地，這點便在船上也未必就能暫時忘記，自然愛海者的夢，於是成了更空虛的夢。不過留着這個夢，我們終有一天可以恢復可愛的海洋吧。</p>
<p>海以外，山是自然的另一種美麗的創造物。在中國，似乎一般人比愛海更愛着山。山本來也莊嚴，深邃，粗野得很可愛的，但中國人所愛的似乎不是這些。我們有所謂山林文學，那不過是設法在風雅中尋出一種別開生面的點綴，最多也寄託一點個人的憤懣。憤懣也往往幷不怎樣極端，這或許是寫着詩人該溫柔敦厚的習慣，但也許是恐怕因此寒斷終南捷徑的出路。這也怕就世遯世者不肯浮海而要入山的理由，一浮海也許就永無返期，而入山是有出山之日的。如此，入山自然也不會太深，道只要翻開歷代史書中的穩逸傳一看，就可以證明。由他們替我們製造出許多名山，且因爲前後蹈襲，名山的盛名愈大，而這些名山，幷沒有什麼具有什麼，雄奇，偉大的意味的。眞的深山大壑，還只有叛逆的强盜去住。正如那些泛海過番的飢民海盜，沒有海洋文學留給我們，山大王們也不會留給我們什麽山林文學。對於國內的崇山峻嶺，連幷非在偏遠之地的，我們也不大知道，至於遠在邊陲的什麽世界屋脊，世界第一高原，第一高峯，我們更無從知道，直到他們戴上奧斯騰，挨佛拉斯脫等等外國名字。跋涉幾千里的長途，爬上那些絕無人烟，滿眼是冰雪，隨時有危險的地域，是爲了什麽，我們且不能了解。我們不懂得開拓，不懂得磨練，幷且不懂得夢想。我們不能想像出在那超絕，崇高純潔，奇偉的境界裏可以有如何愉快的感覺，試展開一幅那樣的圖畫在我們面前，怕引起的只是戰慄而不是嚮往。而我們自信是一個偉大的民族，常常高與地舉出我們的長城來作證明，證明了，證明這偉大關鎖在由山海關到嘉峪關的一綫以內。</p>
<p>長城外，　也是沙漠，西也是沙漠，沙漠，確似乎完全荒瘠而無用。但那一帶產生堅忍的駱駝，產生矯健的名馬，同樣也產生驃悍堅實的民族。沙漠幷沒有完全呑沒一切的生命，而是反孕育出一種特異的生命力。我們又稱牠爲瀚海，牠也眞具有海的種種性質，却又有海所沒有的强硬與曠野。浮過大海，登過高山，不再經過一决沙漠旅行，算不得經過最堅苦卓絕的試騐。這堅苦卓絕的試騐，能產生什麼效果，我們只要一看歷史上埃及人，阿拉伯人，蒙古人，突厥人的都造成龐大的帝國，就要驚嘆。如果漢族西來說可靠，那末最初漢族勢力的擴張，或也得力於由在沙漠中吸到的曠野的空氣。可是一到安居之後，逐漸變成平和，再不想重受一下沙漢的陶鎔，而只對之驚懼，憎嫌。對於匃奴，早先就存下彼能來我不能去的觀念，長城就是這卑怯觀念下的產物。也許曾發生過相當效力，但這自製的枷鎖却有更大的弊害，有一些傑出的英雄，也曾努力想把枷鎖打破，但隨着打破不久就又被重行修補起來。唐代盛時出塞苦的歌曲，把具雄心的人主，諷刺得不成模樣。「馬後挑花馬前雪，敎人那得不回頭。」回頭，回頭，回進長城，回到長安，回去西蜀。等到詩人再發出。凉州陷來四十年，河隴侵將七千里。平時安西萬里疆，今日邊防在鳳翔。」的慨嘆，早已無辦法了。經過再深屈辱，才知道唐人是一個可自負的名稱，甚至有時也要稱揚成吉斯汗的子孫，但我們仍少有人了解沙漠，想知道沙漠。極端，猛烈將永遠與我們無分，而讓沙漠培養他人的卓絕精神的因素嗎？西北風起了，能不能多帶來一點沙漠的氣息，引起我們對沙漠的渴慕呢。</p>
<h3 id="c193">讀由勤·活尼爾戲曲雜寫（三） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>讀者們，我在上面，曾有一個請求，「讓我像煞是一個劇評家，像煞是一個懂得戲劇的人」，到了現在，這倘請求，我又要自請撤銷，而講你們當我是一個完全不懂戲劇的人，而我所寫的也完全當它是戲劇門外漢的話。戲的本質是接近詩，我的偏見，（也許有許多塲合，事實上是如此），帶有濃重詩意的劇本，只配去讀，而在某種限度內，是不大適合於表演的。雪萊會說，詩人是世界的不公認的立法者。現在雖不是一個詩的時代，而詩人也被那些肚皮裏只有脂肪的商人，鄙爲一錢不値。但一直到現在，戲劇中，能够吸引起人的情感的，仍有借重拉詩的地方。愛爾蘭詩人夏芝的許多劇本，都充滿這樣的特點。另一位愛爾蘭出名而比較前進的戲劇家如「西安·奧凱漱」Sean　O’Casey的「在門內」（Whithin　the　Gates）與「黃河之月」（The　Moon　In　Yellow　River）也都滲透詩人的氣息在內。雖則戲劇的演出，其動人的地方，並不在那些詩意的說白，而近代戲劇的傾向，也竭力在避免掉拿這種手法來作增加演劇重要效果的工具，可是對話的精俏，和戲劇家喜歡用那富有意義的獨白，仍是現代一般偉大的戲劇家所慣用。我們讀沃尼爾的戲曲，我們時常可以看到他的劇中的英雄，很少不停止他們的動作，作長而艱深的獨白（Soliloquy）的，而那種獨白，雖然不像以往戲劇家一樣，用詩的形式出之，可是他的散文的獨白中，我們仍然覺得有一種詩的　律。此如在「大神白朗」中，我們就可以讀到這樣澎湃熱情的對話。</p>
<p>「狄翁：白朗將仍舊需要我——去證實他是活着的！我曾愛，縱慾，獲得了愛與失掉愛，放聲而歌與失聲而哭！我會是生命的戀人！我曾經完成她的意志，如果她現在與我訣別，那是我太懦弱不能反轉來支配她。我不是够做她的生物，你得創造她，或者她要請求你來毀壞你自己。」</p>
<p>在這下面的狄翁的節獨白，更充分透露這樣的氣息：</p>
<p>「狄翁：（有着一種痛苦的迷惑）：爲什麼我怕跳舞，我是這種喜歡音樂旋律，優雅唱歌，大笑的人呀？爲什麼我怕生活下去，我是這種愛生命，肉體的美麗，以及地，天，海的生動的顏角的人呀？爲什麽我怕愛情，我是這種喜歡愛情的人呀？爲什麽我怕，我是這種不怕的人呀？爲什麽我要爲達到憐憫，而假裝傲慢呀？爲什麽爲達到瞭解而一定躱藏在自卑當中呀？爲什麽我是這樣羞惡我的强壯而這樣　我的弱點呀？爲什麽我一定要住在一個囚籠中，像一個罪犯，反抗與憎恨，而我又是這種愛和平與友誼的人呀？（雙手抱緊高舉在上祈禱）呀上帝，我爲什麽生下來沒有皮，那樣使我爲了接觸，或被接觸，可以着上甲胃。」</p>
<p>在「鎔合」中，我們也可以看到那些字裏行間跳出詩意的辭句：</p>
<p>『凱樸：聽！有時我在夜深醒來——在一個黑暗的世界獨個人在千億萬年的黑暗中。我感覺像要對上帝喊求慈悲，因爲生命還存在着。於是本能地我尋找你——我的手摸着你！你是在那兒——在我的旁邊——有生氣的——有了你我變爲一個全人，一個眞實！生命指導我回轉去經過千億萬年而達於你。那顯示我開始的統一，這樣可以使我相信結局的統一。』像這樣有力的句子，我不知道有沒有這樣的演員能够勝任把其間的意義充分地演出來，深深地打入聽衆的心家。詩意的獨白，我想來，在我們讀的時候，是很易激動我們的情感，而在上演的時候，我就覺得，那漫長而嚴重的獨白，却是令觀衆最討厭的事。我還記得，在一二八以前與稜磨兄到北四川路現在已拆毀的愛波羅電影院去看「沃尼爾」的「安娜克里斯蒂」，那劇中是「嘉寶」飾安娜，已故老太婆電影皇后「瑪麗·特　漱」飾「馬太」，飾「克里斯·克里斯托佛生一和年靑水手「白克」的兩角是誰，我已完全忘記。那决去的動機，是慕名，而結果却是失望，我記得馬太與安娜的對白，占去了一大部分，雖則特蘭漱與嘉寶都是兩個能演戲的角色，可是黃金國的導演，都差不多是那麽庸俗的膿包傢伙，想拿文學名作來號召，而又無那樣手法來盡量表現得生動，結果弄得四不像，非但不能討好原作者，連觀衆也給他賣了。並且劇本的後部，完全被導演腰斬。安娜和她的父親，把「白克」從海上救起後，安娜卽與他戀愛，老「克里斯托佛生一看見了這樣情形，在船頭上詛咒「老魔鬼的海」，像然演到此就告閉幕。至於沃尼爾原劇中安娜因爲「白克」的愛她，發生內心的痛苦，和因爲不願欺騙「白克」，而坦白地告訴她的以往，以及「白克」聽了道一切遂悻悻然以去，和「白克」的不能忘懷安娜，再行回到安娜的地方來，以及老「克里斯托佛生」的始則反對，繼則見「白克」來，很爲欣喜等節目，却都給「好萊塢」大導演的大刀闊斧除得一乾二凈了。再加之有聲電影的設備較壞，以及我的英語的聽的能力較差，我從開幕迄於閉幕，只聽懂了dat　ole　davil，sea（那個老魔鬼，海）。所以從電影散塲，我直是懷了一肚子的怨氣。如果照有些人的說法，去看電影，不是去看片子，而是去看名星，那末我看到了嘉寶，我就應該滿足，然而我的目的，剛巧不趁那樣，於是我失望，於是我更確信我的偏見：好的劇本，自有其本身的價値，而不在他的表演的效果，表演的效果好和壞，也許不在其本身，而在其本身以外。這樣表演的價値是一事，戲劇的本身價値又是一事。</p>
<p>從一個只有機會讀劇本而無機會看名角兒演出有名的劇本，只能作如此想。不過我們要知道沃尼爾所以被認爲美國偉大的戲甽家，所以被認爲一個戲劇偉大的嘗試者，他的成功，不但在他戲劇本身有其特殊的成就，並且戲劇演技上，增加了許多新的技巧。比如我們知道的「瓊斯皇帝」這一獨白劇，牠的演出的成功，就是在裏面加入了新的技巧，因爲這一劇從一開頭一直到慕閉，聽衆始終聽到冬冬的鼓聲。冬冬的聲音最初是每分鐘有韻律地響七十二次，按照常人的脈博的次數。後來隨着劇情的緊張，冬冬鼓聲的速度，愈變愈急，到了最後，如發在般地響着。這種冬冬的鼓聲，自然達到使觀衆的心理緊張的效果，而使戲劇的演出，隨了這種響聲而格外緊張。在「奇異的揷曲」中，沃尼爾又加入了一種新花樣——演員的傍白。在這戲劇中，演員除開應有的道白外，在每句話以後，再用語言來說明他們的思想。換句話說，聽衆可用演員的傍白而聆會劇中角色的眞實情感。在「大神白朗」中，我們父看到一種新奇的嘗試，那就是用面具表示劇中人物的兩重個性。當劇中角色說的話是表現他的外表的，那位角色就戴上了面具，反之，當他是表現他內心所欲講的話，他脫去了他的面具。這種創試，據有許多人的意見，並不是現代戲劇的技巧的更進一步，而是退回一步，因爲我們在希臘劇中就可以找到這樣戴面具的演劇。在我們這老大的國土，也有面譜這花樣存在。面具之與面譜，不能說其間沒有相似的意義。可是因爲沃尼爾採用面具，我們國土內的遺老遺少們就發昏樣高興，以爲在「京戲」中找到了外國的根據，京戲可以抬高了它的評價，這是一個胡扯。講到這兒，我又要借沃尼爾的一個四幕劇「第一個人類」（“The　First　Man）中那位由鑛工程師而變爲地質學家，由地質學家而爲人類學家的主角寇蒂斯的幾句話來開個頑笑，並作本文本節的結束。沃尼爾「第一個人類」中主角寇蒂斯相信人種的最初的家是在亞細亞」。所以他要「到西馬拉耶同北部中央亞細亞去」。在這地方，他希望找出我們第一個祖先。雖則這件事對於他「一千萬當中，只有一個機會一但他相信，他至少可找出「有根據的綫索」。也許在這地方可以找到第一個人，和他的生活狀態。於是寇蒂斯先生决心帶了他的妻子到中國來完成他的偉大的企圖。但他的妻子却因爲生產小孩而死了，他雖决定到中國來，而沃尼爾的劇本都在道動身時閉幕，因此，他並沒有告訴我們他究有沒有在我們這老大的國家內發現「第一個人類」。可是我們最近發現的北京猿人（Sinaihropus　Pekinnensis）不曉得够不够上資格稱爲「第一個人類」，然而現在那替封建勢力說敎的京戲，却够得上資格說是「第一個人類」的娛樂。這種由原始音樂江湖雜要，地方戲劇凑成的「三拚鍋」，旣沒有元人雜劇，明人傳奇，那種文學價値，也沒有現代歐美戲劇那樣有嚴密的結構，那樣能表現生活的意義，到了今日，還有許多遺老遺少們認爲牠的中間有許多已經腐爛了的部分可以改革。可是我把牠拆開來，我總覺得牠已沒有一個有價値的部分，沒有一件可保留的東西，這種表現博物院中「木乃伊」生活的戲劇，最好的辦法，還是把它送到博物院中最爲妥當，供我們的考古學家去作硏究的資料，或者像古宮博物院的古物一樣，送到外國去給外國人開開眼界（不過要富心在外國丟醜）。自然我這樣門外漢的話，在這「冠枝木之冠帶死牛之脅」的老寶貝又抬頭之日，在這方士煉丹術，陰陽家的識緯書，道士的太極圖都成爲精神文明象徵之時，自然很易冒了大不韙的，可是一個年靑人又那管得了這許多呢？</p>

<h3 id="c196">關於「一柱樓詩」獄 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>我曾經借乾隆的上諭，談過胡中藻詩獄的成因，殘陋粗率，在所不免，這回又想談談一柱樓詩獄了。淸代文字獄檔里關於徐述夔案件的記載，我沒有見到。現在所談的，是根據幾本私人的筆記。個人的見聞有限，而短文又不便於多所引證，那淺陋和粗率，當然還是不免的。</p>
<p>徐述夔是江蘇東台縣人，乾降戊午科舉人，著有一柱樓詩六卷，一柱樓小題詩一卷，和陶詩一卷，學庸講義一卷，蘧卷堂雜著一卷，想貽瑣筆二卷，論語摘要二卷。前四種於乾隆二十八年，由他的兒子徐懷祖刊刻行世，後三種則抄存家內，到得四十三年案發後，就先後繳呈，加以銷燬了。他生前大概很服膺呂晚林，受其影饗甚深。這證以後來審理這案件的大臣們的奏摺，說是：「此案已死之徐述夔，身爲本朝舉人，編造詩集講義等書，敢將逆犯呂留良業經銷毀邪說，引爲宗　，已屬悖逆不法」云云，就可以確定了。足見那里面很有一點激烈的排滿思想。就事論事，　淸朝許多文字獄里，一柱樓詩獄可以算是一件較有事實，而又並不十分寃枉的案子。</p>
<p>至於這案子的起因，據同一奏摺——大學士阿桂等奏會訊徐述夔案分別據議摺里說：</p>
<p>徐懷祖前經置買同縣蔡嘉樹堂弟蔡耘田地數頃，契價銀　千四百兩，迨其身故之後，蔡嘉樹因地內　有伊祖墳墓，於四十二年冬間，欲用銀九百六十兩贖回，向徐懷祖之子徐食田講說不允，隨經訐訟。維時該縣先已遵旨出示，查繳違礙書籍，本年四月初間，徐食田聽聞蔡嘉樹因伊不允贖地，欲將伊祖刊板書中違礙之處控告，該犯隨於初六日，將已刻各書並板片在縣呈繳，該縣凃耀龍當卽批候閱示。至初化日，蔡嘉樹亦將一柱樓詩等書並沈德潛所作徐述夔傳在縣呈首，其呈內聲稱：恐有違礙。未將語句摘出。該縣因見傳內稱其一柱樓詩集業已付梓，並列有徐述夔所著未刻書名，而徐食田所繳已刻之書，尚未全備，於十一日出票指名傳繳，徐食田復於十六日將其未刻抄本三種繳縣，批候解局。……</p>
<p>豪紳們的田地糾紛，往往就成　蕩產殺頭的導火綫，這一回，也還是如此的。縣官判令徐食田撥給蔡嘉樹墓田十畝，本來已經可以告一段落了，而蔡嘉樹忽然硏究起徐食田繳書的日子來。被他打聽着的，偶偏不是第一次——初六——的日子，而是補繳——十六——的日子，於是他認爲徐食田目首在自己告發以後，縣官受賄，改告爲首，有意替徐食田開脫。就把一柱樓詩里悖逆的句子摘出來，告到江寗藩司衙門里去。藩司幕友陸琰，在呈詞後面批了：「與爾何干！飭發揚州府謝啟昆，行提卷犯查審，又在行文里批着：「搜羅書籍，原爲明末國初，有著作悖謬，詩章諷刺，實有違礙者，俱應收解奏繳。至講論經傳文章，發爲歌吟篇什，如只有字句失檢，涉於疑似，並　悖逆實迹者，將首舉之人，卽以所誣之罪依律反坐，著有明條。倘係蔡嘉樹挾嫌，妄行指摘，思圖傾陷，亦卽嚴訊擬議。」等話。這時候，一柱樓詩集等書，已經由東台縣解呈江寗書局，但因爲沒有粘簽，又發回該縣加簽去了。關於陸琰批詞的經過，和江寗書局的內幕，可以看江寗布政司陶易的供詞，據供：</p>
<p>江蘇省辦理收繳遺書的事，原在江寗設一總局，派委略　文義的屬員　員，在局司事。遇各州縣繳到書籍，彙成數千部，送我衙門，轉呈總督核辦。至此决東台縣稟送徐食田呈繳伊祖的書本，我因正値大旱求雨，所以縣禀及一柱樓詩等書，實在不曾寓目，卽經局員擬批發縣加簽。迨六月中，蔡嘉樹到我衙鬥控告，我幕友陸琰就批發揚州府査辦。並於書辦催稿內。添加傾陷反坐的話，我也不曾細看，就畫行批發了。及至學政劉墉參奏後，我從徐州查災回來，檢閱文稿，就對幕友說：文　辦得大錯了。他說：曾奉過旨意，自首免罪，此書徐食田繳在先，蔡嘉樹又來告他，這樣批也不算大錯。我說：到底是錯了。……</p>
<p>徐食田繳書在先，東臺縣在沒有改告　首，這是事實；　繳書在先還不能叨沐「自首免罪」的皇恩，却也是事　。因爲　降朝對於繳呈違碍書籍的規定，自首固可免罪，知人欲告而自首，是只准减罪，却不准免罪的。徐食田自首的日子，距蔡嘉樹告發只有三天，河水已混，無論如何也洗不乾凈　祖遺的罪狀了。陸琰的所謂「奉過旨意，自首免罪」，在這裏已不適川；不過他的批令揚州府嚴訊，一倘係挾嫌，卽以所誣之罪反坐」，由我看來，還不失爲持平之論，不過這持平之論放在乾隆御用的天平稱上，就不免顯出偏徇來，這也是必然的。</p>
<p>一柱樓諸書除了引用呂留良的「邪說」以外，被認爲最最悖逆的，是他自己的詩裏有「明朝期振翮，一舉去淸都」這兩句。此外被指摘的，還有：「莫敎流下土，久矣混蕕薰」：「蟄龍竟誰從」；重明敢謂天無意」；「市朝雖亂山林治」；「江北久無乾凈土」；「陪鬢非今制，無爲詡獨淸」；「不知警蹕淸塵日，可有情形觸屬車」；「乾坤何處可爲家」；「舊日天心原夢夢，近來世事益非非」等句，這裏面，有明顯，有隱晦，有事實，有羅織，可就不能一概而論了。但最有趣的，是列名校對的徐首髮和沈成濯兩人的名字，據那些審判老爺的意思，以爲兩人「命名之義，均毫無淸理，而四字連屬，則係隱刺本朝薙髮之制」，所以就等於「植黨在嘷，尤爲可恨」了。現在再看這兩人的供詞：</p>
<p>徐首髮供：因初生時髮長，乳名髮　。九歲從徐述夔讀書，爲之取名首髮，並告以「身體髮膚，受之父母」之義，故字爲受之。曾聞徐述夔言：本朝剃頭，不如明朝不剃好看。且自稱其學如在明朝，可與唐荊州董思白相仿，如今人看不出來的話。至後只從他讀了兩年書，後來卽另從師，改名首發，應試入學，現有學盼可査的。又據沈成濯供；幼時從徐述夔讀書，爲之取名。並聽見徐述夔說過明朝有頭髮，如今剃了頭，就是濯濯　意思。　據各供：校書名字，係徐述夔故後，伊子徐懷祖刻書時，自行列入。</p>
<p>供詞裏面，有些話的出於牽扯，是一看就可以明白的。這和如今的犯人聲言在捕房裏的口供，是迫於環境，不得不招，有同樣的隱痛。卽就徐述夔的替他們命名而論吧，雖像出於故意，却也算不了諷刺，更當不起造反。然而結果呢，不但首髮成濯，連腦袋也一齊搬家了。</p>
<p>旣不留髮，又不留頭，這才置是亡國者的好榜樣。</p>
<p>一柱樓詩獄的結局，徐述夔徐懷祖父子已死，照凌遲律，剉屍梟首；正犯之孫徐食出徐食書，斬立决，親屬連坐；校對徐首發，沈成濯，藩司陶易，慕友陸琰，斬立决；爲和陶詩作跋的毛澄卽黃斌，杖一百，流　千里；知府謝啟昆發往軍臺效力；知縣凃耀龍杖一百，徒一年；沈德潛撒出鄉賢祠，革去官銜謚典，仆毀御賜碑文。後來除了所有「斬立决」，改爲「斬監候，秋後處决」外，是別無什麼變動的。至於原告蔡嘉樹，却一無所得；倘非「皇上」特別開恩，險些兒也被謀了「早屬知情，不即舉首，及因爭訟田土，挾嫌告發」之罪了。</p>
<p>豪紳們常常有一種夢想，以爲借別人的手來壓倒對方，自己就可以出頭。所以他們利於爲奴才，也利於爲漢奸。然而，因淸朝文字獄而流的血，畢竟浸漬了志士的雄心，淹沒了滿洲的天下了。告訐之風未歇，志士之血不乾，這是値得深思的。</p>

<h3 id="c197">「髮」「粉」何罪？ <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 無次</p>
<p>女人們之不能離開胭脂花粉，似乎是古今中外視同一律的。但不　女人們自己怎樣愛悅，社會上某一種勢力却又不贊成她們打扮得花枝招展。說他們不愛吧，他們自己太太的臉，却又個個是「嬌滴滴越顯紅自」。</p>
<p>不久以前本埠有禁止女敎員燙髮塗脂的新聞，理由是海關的巨額進口數字都是她們造成的，而且又還「不足以爲人師表」呢！最近土耳其也有近於同樣的舉措，而且說得更冠冕：「女敎員如效女伶着艷色之衣服，施時髦之化妝，必與子弟以重大之惡影響，故應懸爲厲禁……」</p>
<p>綜合這些見解，大抵都是反對女敎員塗脂抹粉，而其他闊人太太或姨太太之類，則不在禁止之列，卽使有時候也影響到海關的巨額進口數字，或者也能够「與社會以惡影響」，但那又當別論焉。</p>
<p>以上算是過去的享實。而且主動的大抵都是男人。現在可輪到婦女自己發言了，在婦女界綏遠剿匪慰勞委員會的播音宜傳上，某女士大聲疾呼地說：</p>
<p>「尤其我們婦女界，假使能少買一盒脂粉或是少燙一次頭髮，在前綫的將士，不就多了一件背心或是一付手套嗎？」</p>
<p>這意思很明白，要使前綫將士多一件背心或一付手套，只要少買一念脂粉或少燙一次頭髮　行。這是婦女們自己的意見，而這意見也値得珍視的。就動機來設慰勞前綫將士和攸關風化是截然的不同。在這樣的環境下，我們可以大膽地反對維持風化，但沒有理由可以反對慰勞前綫將七，爲了慰勞而少買一盒脂粉或少燙一次頭髮，都是極應該的。</p>
<p>但這裏父還有一點問題，那就是「少買」或「少燙」。所謂「少」，只是减少「買」與「燙」的數量，而不是絕對不要「買」或「燙」。能够絕對不「買」或不「燙」，不是更有益嗎？然而婦女們自己的意見却是道樣。</p>
<p>樣的意見是很天眞的，它說明了女人去慰勞剿匪將士的大前提之下，還沒有放棄花粉。倘然不是神經過敏，我猾說這些話的那位女士，她自己在去電臺之前，就曾抹了一次粉，而且也燙了髮的。婦女們自己的意見何以和社會上某些人的主張這樣對立起來，這是一個謎。</p>
<p>許多人都被這個謎所迷惑。他們不明白何以兩者之間有這樣的距離。其實這不過是利害觀點的不同吧了。某些人一定要婦女「在大庭廣衆」之間打扮得非常質樸，才顯出目己的尊嚴而婦女們自已呢，却又覺得洗去鉛華，會使自己的地位降格，有這樣的矛盾，所以禁止儘管禁止，而塗脂抹粉還是塗脂抹粉，甚至在極重要的前提下，還不肯放棄這個意見。</p>
<p>若是把自己的利害放在後頭，結果就不同了。謂余不信，有報爲憑：</p>
<p>「晋省李淑卿女士，念國難當頭，請願毀家紓難，呈趙主席文云……妾在靜樂縣有地一白七　畝，舖院一處……除將舖院之半留作妾夫休養費外，餘則供獻政府……妾或爲國家社會服務，或爲家庭敎師，均可糊口……』</p>
<p>要有李女士這樣精神的，不致爲環境而動搖其信念，李女士雖沒有說不塗脂，不燙髮，但她的貢獻，實在比不塗脂不燙髮要偉大得多，不力求普遍的節約，不力求養成犧牲小我的精神，上上下下斤斤計較於塗脂抹粉，眞是『舍本逐末，吾未知其可也！』</p>
<h3 id="c198">太平橋 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 聖路</p>
<p>打更的聲音離去不遠，有一羣入掌着馬燈向太平橋走來。爲首的四個是聽差打扮，手裏執着路口採來的楊枝條，把枝皮倒捲上去，紮成一個花球那樣垂在頂端，他們走路時，那個楊柳球和他們勝利的心一樣在昏暗的燈光中盪來擺</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>去。</p>
<p>走到太平橋下，四個人發了一聲暗記的號令，後面那些穿短衣的馬上捲捲衣袖，捋捋褲脚，槓棒，繩索，鐵撬，及一切動用的工具都分散在各人手裏，原來是他們動手拆太平橋了。</p>
<p>縣城裏自從通行黃包車後，石級的高橋都一一拆的拆，塡的塡，祗有通過官河的幾頂大橋也費了一點工程，重行建築了平坦的石板僑的。太平橋是在縣城最西，相近臨縣的邊界了，附近都是貧戶，及外省入的臨時住宿之地，太平橋就不會阻碍黃包車的交通的，因爲根本住在太平橋附近的人們是沒有錢坐黃包車的，他們是有着像黃包車夫一樣堅强的兩條腿。而且太平橋在這縣城裏相傳下來是能够主宰居民太平的威權的：不論貧富顯貴人家結婚，新郎新娘的花轎都要在太平橋上繞一個圈子的，以保合宅太平。所以在黃包車通行了一年之後，所有的僑樑都拆成了平地，要拆太平橋的主意却沒有一個人提議過。</p>
<p>但是這幾頂數千年以前的建築物，橋樑，石級等都是上好的材料，包拆卸的工頭都拆一頂橋發了一筆大財。那末，利之所在，也有人胆敢出來主拆縣城裏獨存的大橋太平橋了，因爲工頭的背面都有着撑腰的本城紳士的。就在一次什麽會議的時候，爲了交通便利起見通過了拆太平橋的提議了。</p>
<p>消息和進行都是一樣快，一方面內定的工頭獲得了拆橋的投標權，一方面太平橋附近的居民集合起來要對付拆橋的工頭……</p>
<p>在一天早上，一個肩着木牌，打着金鑼的人沿大街往西走報告要拆太平橋了。這是一種習俗，據說拆橋，破土的時候小孩子是不能跑出門來的，否則便要攝去靈魂鎭壓工程的。但是小孩子靈魂沒有攝去，敲鑼的人却是打傷在太平橋脚下，沒有一天功夫死去了。</p>
<p>這自然是迷信於太平橋能主宰本城太平的居民底憤怒的表示了。於是工頭請示於背後的大紳士，紳士們當然開了個所謂會議。——本來大紳士們要對付小百姓是輕而易舉的事，然而在這件事上恐怕要鬧出入命來，一鬧人命，當然要驚動縣公署，那末，這筆穩穩到手的大財或許會翻倒在那些蠢蠢的小百姓手里的。</p>
<p>拆太平橋的工程就冷了下來有一個月之久。</p>
<p>這天，他們在半夜裏動工，就是一個月商議出來的結果。在那些要算在本城起身最早的人們起身時，太平橋的橋樑已經拆卸下來了，四個聽差分兩個一面彷彿衛隊似的保護着，工人，二個人一檔，流着汗用鐵撬費力地拆卸石級，看上去比舖一頂石板僑的工程要費事幾倍以上。</p>
<p>小百姓們把孩子藏在家裏之後，都漸漸地圍到橋堍來，有幾個强硬的男人就挺身到最前面去，指着聽差責問他們爲什麽要拆太平橋。出來幹事的聽差都忘了自家的身份的，把手裏的楊柳球輕輕盪着，用眉毛告訴了發言的人一個最難堪的回答。</p>
<p>那些强硬的男入除了有着像黃包車一樣堅强的兩條腿以外，他們還有一對鐵樣的拳頭，看到狗樣的張牙舞爪，他們又將對付那個打鑼人一樣地發落他們了。</p>
<p>他們馬上退後兩步，用楊柳球指着最前面的一個額角？罵起來了：</p>
<p>「好！就是你們那些猪，打死阿根的，抓起來，送衙門吃官司！」</p>
<p>那一個小百姓不怕吃官司呢？女人趕前頭來抓住了男人的手膀，吃官司還不如拆了太平橋，窮人們就是保得了合宅太平，他們還有比太平更重要的吃飯問題呢，男人就是他們最好的飯碗！</p>
<p>完工的那天，有幾位紳士來視察的時候，雪亮的包車在橋面上很便利的拖過了。</p>
<h3 id="c199">鷹鳴 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 陳蕪</p>
<p>—村居雜記—</p>
<p>當嘹亮的顫抖的鷹鳴在半空中迴旋的時候，我常不自覺的走到庭心，仰望上空，追尋那隻歌唱自然的偉大，自然的懷抱的鷹。</p>
<p>鷹的歌聲使我想起一個壯士，使我想起高高凌在天空俯視下界的偉人，使我想起自由奔放的磊落的完人。它是雄壯的，激發的，充滿了正視一切的氣慨者底鳴聲。</p>
<p>往往我找遍天空，遠遠的，或就在我頭上，一　　　在　　　　　　也可以看到鷹的整個身子。我的心胸寬廣了，心彷彿駝在鷹的背上，我也正在盤旋，正在俯視着下空。半天，直到我看它飛遠了，我才失望地回到那間黑暗的屋子。</p>
<p>會飛多麼好呢？雖然許多人借了人類的智慧飛過去了，但我看到的仍只有幾丈的周圍，彷彿在牢中看着世界。</p>
<p>我感謝那幾隻鷹，當太陽爬上地平線時，我就聽到那嘹亮，尖銳的歌聲，有時當太陽跌到那一堵高山背後去時，它們就彷彿是去追太陽，往西飛，盤旋着，我忘記了四圍的重山將我的眼睛困住，忘記了靜默到近乎半死的鄉居生活。我的腦中有靑年的血在跳，我的思想逃出了爲生活的寒酸的計較。</p>
<p>有一天，隔鄰孩子告訴我，有家人家捉到兩隻鷹。我聽到，彷彿自己的兄弟被人拘捕了，趕到那一家去，正看到他們將一頭稚鷹關在竹片的籠子裏，在地下另有一隻壯大的鷹軟軟躺着，腹邊流着血，眼睛睜着圓圓的，尖尖的嘴鈎也似的橫在一張破桌邊。我看到那家幾個人的笑容，幾張黃牙齒，在心底我咒駡起他們：卑鄙的人，牠與你們無害，而你們却以怎樣的手段去暗殺牠，去捕捉牠們？</p>
<p>我望着籠子裏那一隻鷹，牠正踊跳着，綠綠的眼睛恨恨的望着人，抖抖麻衣點的羽毛，忽然仰起頭嘹亮地呌了。被這一聲想不到的鳴聲所驚，再定神聽着在我眼前彷彿出現了勇敢的人，他在責問對他不必要的毒害，對他做下的可恥的行徑。</p>
<p>我又聽到鷹鳴了，這决以後，我聽到的鷹鳴，覺得牠們的鳴聲中有咀罵人類的憤怒的聲音。</p>
<h3 id="c200">買書後感 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 方潔</p>
<p>我一向就有一點歡喜買書的嗜好：但因受了經濟的限制，我又從不曾能痛快地買過一回書。所以直到現在止，我的書還是積得很少的。</p>
<p>使我抱着非常遺憾的是在去年十月間，我們已移駐在浙江的一個縣城里。其時我正幹着一份小差使，每月也有好幾十元的收入，這總算是我在經濟上的比較寬裕期；因之，我極力想在這時能多買些書。每天都興奮地在街上找書店，可是事實上却意外的又給了我另一個打擊：那地方竟找不出一家好的書店。等到年底我回來了，口袋里則早又化得一個不剩。</p>
<p>今天我總算又買了幾册書了，但却使我喚起了的回憶。我覺得有兩個關於買書的問題，要提起一談：</p>
<p>一，書的價格太昂；</p>
<p>二，書的地方性太狹。</p>
<p>由於第一種限制，使書和購買力低弱的讀者絕了緣；由於第二種限制，使書和囿於僻地的讀者絕了緣。</p>
<p>這不能不把牠看成是一個讀書界的絕大的危機！書賈著眼在雪亮的銀幣上，自可置之不管；但這樣却使書削弱了牠的傳播力，减低了牠的羣衆。</p>
<p>書是一種文化的紀錄。在現在，我們的民族正遭遇着空前的艱苦底鬥爭的時期，牠——文化已正需要發揮牠最高度的機能來表現牠的偉大力量，使牠也能活潑地完成國防任務。文化的進展，不僅是一個縱的深入，還應該是一個橫的擴展；不僅是一個上層的研究，還應該是一個下層的活動。在要廣泛的號召一點上。那麼購買力低弱的讀者羣和囿拘於僻地的讀者羣，正是最好的對象！最主要的對象！</p>
<p>事實上這兩種讀者羣也才正是時代的担當者，爭取勝利也必須從他們身上取得保證。那麽，我們該把這些英勇的伙伴一脚踢開嗎？</p>
<p>他們的痛苦我是理解得到的，而且也曾親身體騐過的：徘徊在書店的店門口，懷着一種强烈的慾望，伸着頭看書目。偶然看到一本「名著」了，心就像被針挑撥了一下，明知是一種不可接近的珍品，但仍用親切的心情去搶着翻看，甚至抱在手里做着久久的親近。卒於一根棍子劈頭敲下來了：書的價目像是放大了的車輪在面前轉動，就只好紅着臉和牠告別，看牠撲到別人的懷里去。這時不獨感到苦痛，忿恨，甚而還對別人嫉妬，惱怒。世界上能允許這樣殘酷的事實存在嗎？</p>
<p>至於囿居僻地的讀者也很可憐，新文化的姿態，幾乎是一個海中的月亮，永遠只是影子，兩者之間竟好像都遺忘了。我去年在浙江，所住的還是一個較大的縣城，交通也還便利：但在那僅有的最高學府里，——一所中學而已——我却看到一個傷心的現象，一張校刋算是介紹最新的文藝書籍的目錄，中間所列的竟完全是創造社的前期作品；而這在他們，已覺是見所未見的新奇了！</p>
<p>担任文化工作者請注意這些！</p>

<h3 id="c206">卓別林新片　攝政時期 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>卓別林他繼「摩登時代」後的新劇本共有四個，其一，是刋載紐約Modern　Reviwe上一篇極有諷刺意味的小說，好來塢作背景，描寫一個大製作家的生活。卓別林自己預定作片裏的主角大製作家，他在臨時演員中發現一個少女，想法子和她結了婚，不料後來這少女却把他大部份財產捲去逃走了。並且還預定那個少女由寶蓮葛達担任。</p>
<p>但是後來他又計劃一部作品，是一個靑年作家寫給他的，劇本以卓別林及葛達爲主人翁，大意是說卓別林生活很幸福，是一個百萬富翁，並且有非常美慧的妻子，忽然二决世界大戰爆發，他便被派從軍，在戰塲，他是從前家裏僕人的部下一個士兵。他被目爲間諜，還曾建奇功，等到戰後返家，妻離家破，他變成一個可憐的孤獨流浪者。道個時候，他便愛上了寶蓮葛達——一個同遭不幸的女人，後來他還是凄怨地死去。</p>
<p>第三個，是專門暴露好來塢醜惡的劇本，他說他要宣示：「世界多少人類憧憬着的好來塢的眞面目」，他用深刻之筆剖解了好來塢的資本氣息，和糜爛的生活。</p>
<p>此外他還有許多部新片計劃。在這些新片裏，經過他多决的挑選和考慮，直到最沂，他才正式决定了他的新片二部，其中已經動手拍的一部，名呌Rcgency，我們暫代柿譯稱「攝政時期」。這劇本的原著是現代英國小說家D．L．Murry，劇本的編者是R．V．Bdley，導演是卓別林，主角寶蓮葛黛，據說這部片子裏他不預備出現。有一個令我們値得加以注意的，卽是本片爲全部對白有聲，劇中的對白係美國大劇作家露易辛克萊編寫，它的價値，是可想而知了。</p>
<p>第二部片子才由他和她主演，的在「攝政時期」拍完後再動手。該片內容和命名至今尚未發表，只知在此片內的卓別林是以「現代化的」姿態與吾人相見，他將拋棄其小帽破鞋和襤褸衣裳，穿上現代流行之時裝。據說，這是他「轉變作風」的嘗試，但是「不開口主義」仍是他抱着死不放鬆的。</p>

<p>「生死同心」上映以來，生意極佳，繼此戲後，應雲衛將從事於陽翰笙之新作「夜奔」，是一個以走私問題和學生運動爲題材之作品。</p>
<p>陳波兒在「生死同心」之後，新作還沒有决定，袁牧之正在籌備他編導的新作「馬路天使」。</p>
<p>「十字街頭」已攝成三分之二，還剩一部份很重要的外景未拍。</p>
<p>「夜奔」也須於舊歷年底之前完成，待「十字街頭」發出外景後開拍。這樣，二廠便有三組戲同時開拍。</p>
<p>參觀拍「十字街頭」之學生甚多，有交大，大夏，光華，復旦等校，也許是這個戲是描寫失業大學生生活的緣故。</p>

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Embassy this afternoon. Foreign Minister Zhang Qun invited Ambassador Kawagoe to discuss the matter at the ministry at 7:30 PM.

<p>(Qingdao) Yesterday, nine Japanese merchant yarn factories here went on strike. The number of participating workers was over 25,000. The Japanese authorities, for precautionary measures, dispatched a thousand Japanese marines, who landed this morning. Half of them went to the Japanese yarn factory area to protect Japanese property. The remaining 500 were stationed in the Japanese Club in case of emergency. The Japanese marines searched party headquarters and other institutions and arrested three prominent Chinese figures, who were then released. Fully armed marines patrolled the streets. However, no accidents have occurred so far. Qingdao Mayor Shen Hong-lie has protested the actions of the Japanese authorities to the Japanese Consul-General, and has telegraphed to Nanjing for instructions. Mayor Shen is now trying to prevent any accidents from happening to the workers of the factories in the north.

<p>(Allied News Agency, Shanghai) The situation in Qingdao is serious. The Japanese Third Fleet flagship Izumo left Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 3rd to rush to Qingdao. Commander-in-Chief Okawa and new Commander-in-Chief Hasegawa decided to take over duties in Qingdao. (3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable reports, some workers in the Japanese yarn factories in Qingdao recently went on strike due to demands for wage increases. The local authorities persuaded and mediated, and arrested suspected elements. The labor strike may be quelled. The striking workers did not act excessively. However, the Japanese suddenly closed all the yarn factories without reason on the 2nd, and dispatched troops to land at 3:00 AM on the 2nd. In addition to stationing 40 people in each of the nine yarn factories, another 300 people were stationed in the Japanese naval assembly hall in the city to protect Japanese shops. At the same time, dozens of teams went to the city party headquarters, Jiaoji Railway party headquarters, and Jiaoji Railway police station to search for important documents. They also went to the National Martial Arts Hall and arrested the secretary of the hall. It is reported that our diplomatic authorities, upon learning of this situation, considered it not only sufficient to incite unrest, but also a violation of Chinese sovereignty. They have lodged a strong protest with Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, demanding that he immediately telegraph the Japanese naval authorities in Qingdao and withdraw the landing forces stationed in various places, restore the original state of the yarn factories, release the arrested personnel, and wait for the local authorities to mediate and resolve the labor-management dispute fairly. At the same time, the Chinese government declared that it reserves the right to make appropriate demands regarding the illegal actions of the Japanese side this time.

<p>(Guihua) The puppet troops counterattacking Bailingmiao have suffered heavy losses. The bandit base at Damiaozi is now wavering. Our troops are determined to annihilate the remaining bandits with all their strength. The recovery of Damiaozi is not far away. There will inevitably be fierce battles on the night of the 3rd and the morning of the 4th. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Five thousand puppet troops, reinforced to the Damiaozi area for several days, launched a fierce counterattack this morning, on the 3rd, under the command of someone, transported by armored vehicles to the vicinity of Bailingmiao. Our troops met them separately. After several hours, hundreds of bandits were killed and countless captured. The bandits collapsed and retreated. In the afternoon, the bandits launched another fierce attack with even heavier artillery fire, but were repelled by us again in the evening. More than ten enemy planes dropped many bombs on the temple on the afternoon of the 3rd, but our troops were well-concealed and suffered no casualties. We were afraid that the bandits would attack again on the night of the 3rd, but our troops were on high alert and there was no worry. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Jining states that a part of the 10th Division of the troops stationed in a certain area of Rehe issued a mobilization order on the 2nd, transporting supplies to the front of Bailingmiao by truck and snowmobile.

<p>(Beiping) A certain area previously convened a meeting of puppet bandit leaders at Jiabusi, deciding to launch a counterattack on Suidong and Bailingmiao in three routes. Later, due to the fact that the troops of De Wang, Li Shou-xin, and Wang Ying were not yet ready, it was difficult to launch for a while. In order to urge them, a certain area offered a reward of one million yuan, but the reward would only be paid if Bailingmiao was recaptured. Another thousand troops from a certain area were sent to Pangjiang to monitor them. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Zhang Jun-zhe's 3,000-strong bandit army stationed in Weichang, Rehe, began to advance westward on the 2nd. More than sixty planes from a certain country and the puppet state landed in Dolun, then transferred twenty planes to Jiabusi. A large amount of military telegraphs and ammunition were stored in Shangdu by a certain area. Due to the attacks by the national army, fearing that the bandits and puppets would be defeated, they were successively transported to Jiabusi from the 1st. Wang Ying's cavalry has all arrived in Subei and will first assist in attacking Bailingmiao, then advance from Subei Wuchuan. (3rd Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chinese government troops are now preparing to launch a punitive expedition, intending to annihilate the "Manchu"-Mongol mixed army that is invading Suiyuan, and completely recover the province of Chahar. Yesterday, there were minor conflicts in Xinghe and Taolin in the Suiyuan area. However, reliable sources report that there is no news of fierce fighting. Currently, military operations in Chahar province are still underway. It is rumored that the "Manchu"-Mongol mixed army intends to launch a general offensive on the 10th. De Wang, under pressure, has agreed to lead his troops westward. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A message has just been received from Zhangyuan that internal strife among the Mongolian troops participating in the invasion of Suiyuan is increasing. Only with significant pressure are they being induced to continue the attack. The soldiers under the command of Wang Ying, the leader of the Mongolian mixed army, suffered a disastrous defeat in Taolin, Suiyuan, so the morale of the army is not high. It is reported that the "Manchu" army has become slightly stronger due to the increased number of Japanese participants. These Japanese are not from the Kwantung Army, but are hired by the "Manchu" regular army. Currently, 5,000 "Manchu"-Mongol troops are stationed in Shangdu, which is the base of operations for the "Manchu"-Mongol mixed army in Suidong. It is rumored that the fighting there will break out soon. Currently, all fronts in Suiyuan are quiet. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Explains Doubts About the Japan-Germany Agreement and Japan's Attitude Toward China, the Soviet Union, Europe, and the United States <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with 40 foreign visitors at his official residence on the morning of the 3rd for an hour. In addition to explaining several doubts about the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact, he also elaborated on the Japanese government's attitude toward the Chinese situation and the reactions of the Soviet Union, Europe, and the United States. When Arita answered various questions regarding Article 2 of the supplementary protocol to the Japan-Germany Agreement, he said: (1) There is no doubt that Japanese or German people and foreigners residing in Japan or Germany who engage in communist activities within Japan or Germany will be punished more severely than before. (2) Japanese or German people who commit the crime of communist activity even outside their home country should be subject to the same severe punishment once they return to their home country. (3) Although the Japan-Germany Agreement has no geographical restrictions, it refers to the exchange of information on communist activities and the joint research of the strictest measures to prevent communism. Even if Japan and Germany were to separately send troops to Catalonia and Suiyuan-Chahar, the agreement does not force Japan to send troops to Catalonia and Germany to send troops to Sui-Chahar. Arita spoke about Article 2 of the agreement, saying that Japan is willing to conclude the same agreement with other countries besides Germany. When asked if Japan would ask Germany to jointly invite China to join the agreement, he replied in the affirmative and said that Japan's proposal to conclude an anti-communist treaty with China was earlier than the Japan-Germany Agreement, so the Japan-Germany Agreement has nothing to do with the aforementioned anti-communist treaty. When asked about the impression of China declaring that it has sufficient strength to contain communist activities, he replied that the attitude of the Chinese government is influenced by certain parties or other places. If the Chinese government is unwilling to agree with us, then Japan has no choice but to wait. When asked if the exchange of information and joint research on the strictest measures to prevent communist activities would make other countries suspect that Japan and Germany intend to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, Arita did not respond to the point about research measures, only saying that the exchange of information will be carried out in any country and within Japan and Germany. For example, the exchange of information between the Japanese and German embassies and consulates in China regarding communist activities in China is one example, but all will be carried out through legal channels. Subsequently, discussing the consequences of the Japan-Germany Agreement on Japan-Soviet relations, Arita said that the agreement is not intended to target the Soviet Union. On the contrary, Japan is seeking to improve Japan-Soviet relations. However, if the Soviet Union admits that it is integrated with the Comintern and therefore refuses to sign a fishery agreement and hinders border negotiations, then Japan-Soviet relations will undoubtedly deteriorate further. Arita continued that there is no issue of concluding a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union because Japan insists on resolving various outstanding issues first. If the outstanding issues are not resolved, it is meaningless to sign only a non-aggression treaty. Arita then sought to dispel the impression that Japan will join the fascist group through the Japan-Germany Agreement to oppose the democratic group. On this point, Arita solemnly declared that this impression is groundless, because if Britain, France, and the United States make proposals, Japan is also willing to conclude the same agreement. The reason why Japan only concluded an agreement with Germany and not with other countries, and did not make proposals to other countries, is only because the Comintern's Seventh Congress decided that Japan and Germany were the targets of its activities. Finally, when asked why Japan did not form a democratic front to resist fascism, even though some Japanese newspapers also believed that fascism threatened world peace, Arita explained that the power of fascism has not spread to other countries.

At 3 PM on the 3rd, the merchants sent representatives to visit Mei Weiliang, the customs commissioner in Tianjin, to negotiate and request a method to stop it. There was no result at that time. According to the merchants, the sale of smuggled oil is very prosperous in Eastern Hebei, and only the pseudo-inspection fee is paid. If self-regulated oil is transported, the cost will be higher than the price of smuggled goods in Eastern Hebei after paying the pseudo-inspection fee in addition to the customs tax. Oil merchants will hardly be able to sell their products. This move by the pseudo-government is intended to support the development and sales of smuggled oil. The business prospects of foreign merchants are frequently in danger. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The pseudo-autonomous government of Eastern Hebei has ordered that all kinds of oil products transported from Tianjin to Eastern Hebei must pay additional taxes in addition to the high taxes already paid to Chinese customs, causing foreign oil companies in North China to be in a dilemma. The Eastern Hebei authorities have threatened that if oil transported into the territory does not comply with the order to pay taxes, it will be treated as smuggled goods, and they will not be responsible for any accidents that may occur. They also verbally declared that oil products should be directly transported into Eastern Hebei through Qinhuangdao in the future, and declared to the Eastern Hebei authorities in Qinhuangdao without going through Chinese customs. They also hinted that if the oil companies do not comply with the requirements, they plan to contact the oil monopoly bureau of "Manchukuo" and exclude foreign oil companies, which have already seen a sharp decline in sales due to competition from smuggled goods. If they suffer this blow in the future, it will be even more unbearable. Asia, Mobil, and Texaco have now sent letters to the Chinese customs authorities requesting instructions. The letters stated that when the central government increased oil taxes, it guaranteed that no other taxes would be levied. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Cartoon of Japan's Military Industry Capital at the Present Stage (Part 1) <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Nangyun</p>
<p>In the wave of "military build-up," Japan's military industry capitalists and the military are worried. "Insufficient metal materials," "Too few resource areas," -- they shouted! Then came -- "National Policy for Iron and Steel," "National Policy for Petroleum," "National Policy for Liquefaction of Coal"... Various national policies have emerged. Integrating these national policies is the "Continental National Policy." If vast resource areas are not occupied, then any national policy will be weak.</p>
<p>This is almost the same for not only Japan, but also capitalist countries such as Italy and Germany, but Japan is particularly panicked.</p>
<p>Imports! Relying solely on importing military raw materials year after year is not a fundamental solution. To achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials, abundant resource areas are essential.</p>
<p>When discussing resource areas, the coal mines of Shanxi and the petroleum of Shaanxi are naturally the most praised. Although "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation" in North China has already begun, and the Longyan Coal Mine has been established, it still takes time from development to acquisition. Now, let's examine the current state of raw materials for Japan's military industry.</p>
<p>The military raw materials that Japan can produce are as follows:</p>
<p>Gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, zinc, mercury, sulfur, iron sulfide, coal, petroleum, and others.</p>
<p>The total output of the Japanese mainland, Taiwan, and Korea was most active during the European War. The total output in 1917 was 680 million yuan. But in the decade after the war, production decreased -- only between 200 and 300 million yuan. It was not until the end of 1931, with the so-called "re-prohibition of gold exports," that it began to become active again. The output in 1935 reached 500 million yuan, but it still has not caught up with the quantity in 1917.</p>
<p>Even if it can maintain a mineral production of 500 million yuan per year, it is still not enough to supply. What's more, there are many minerals that cannot be lacking in the military industry, and Japan cannot produce them in large quantities. Currently, it is actively developing the so-called "Manchukuo," but because the volunteer army in "Manchukuo" is making a lot of noise, and the international situation is so tense, some financial capitalists are also a little hesitant to invest. At the same time, the Japanese government cannot come up with a lot of money for a while. -- Even the funds that the government itself had permitted to invest in "Mantetsu," after Mantetsu President Matsuoka came to Tokyo to negotiate, have not yet been paid smoothly, which makes it impossible to rapidly develop the mineral resources of the pseudo-state. Even if it is developed, it will take some time before it can be used. Therefore, the import of minerals cannot be slowed down, and in order to ensure the realization of the "Continental Policy," the import of raw materials necessary for "military expansion" can only increase day by day. This also means that Japan's "resource national policy" has not yet been fully established.</p>
<p>Now, let's review Japan's mineral output for the past three years (unit: million yuan):</p>
<p>(The above table is based on a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Mines, but the output of Korea and the mineral output of the "Yawata Steel Works Remanufactured Pig Iron Plant" are not included.)</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, it can be seen that Japan's mineral output has been increasing in the past three years. In 1934, it increased by more than 77 million yuan compared to 1933. In 1935, it increased by more than 72 million yuan compared to 1934. The most produced is coal, followed by copper. What should be noted here is that iron and petroleum, which are the most important in the military industry, are produced very little. In 1933, the iron production value was only 18.7 million yuan, and the petroleum production value was 8.9 million yuan. Although the production value increased a lot in 1934 and 1935, the proportion of the required increase is even higher. Without iron and petroleum, there is no way to talk about the development of the military industry. The new "shipbuilding plan" proposed by the Navy Department and the "increase in military equipment," "increase in aircraft," and "expansion of troops in Manchuria" proposed by the Army Department all require a large amount of iron and petroleum. Just take a look at Japan's recent import statistics. From November 1st to the 10th, in just ten days, the import of iron alone accounted for 5,683,300 yuan, and crude oil and heavy oil accounted for 2,275,000 yuan. This import is not accidental, but planned. A detailed investigation of Japan's trade this year shows that Japan is planning to import as much iron and crude oil and heavy oil as possible, which are military raw materials.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the amount of minerals imported into Japan in the past three years (unit: million yuan):</p>
<p>(According to foreign trade reports.)</p>
<p>This shows that Japan's mineral imports are increasing year by year. Of course, because the needs of Japan's military industry are increasing year by year, imports are also increasing year by year. The expansion of the military industry, needless to say, even elementary school students know that it is a more active preparation for war.</p>
<p>Japan's annual import trade averages around 2.5 billion. The increase rate of total imports (sometimes decreasing) is far lower than the increase rate of mineral imports. Among various imported goods, except for cotton, iron often ranks first -- especially this year. The second is crude oil and heavy oil.</p>
<p>Japan's exports are mainly light industrial products. Now, let's list the eight most important exports of Japan:</p>
<p>Wheat flour, canned food, cotton yarn, raw silk, cotton fabrics (cloth), silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, and Meiyalis products. None of the above eight products are light industrial products.

<h3 id="e42">Britain in the International Crisis <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Corner</p>
<p>What Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese authorities are hoping for has long been revealed by their own words and actions. Countries that have been invaded or are at risk of invasion should form a united front, retaliating in kind: an eye for an eye, using anti-aircraft guns against aircraft, and gas masks against poisonous gas. This is undoubtedly the most appropriate and intelligent approach. However, establishing a common front for peace is easier said than done. For example, Britain has the power to influence the global political landscape, but the British Conservative Party, despite knowing that the formation of an aggressive front would endanger world peace, still clings to outdated foreign policies without changing. Although British Foreign Secretary Eden made a solemn speech at the International Chamber of Commerce on the first of this month, stating that "If Belgium is invaded by another country without provocation, Britain will come to its aid," as if he were very concerned about events on the continent, the reality is quite different. German diplomats have seen through Britain's true intentions and understand the shortsightedness of the British Conservatives. As long as Germany does not infringe on British interests, Britain is happy to turn a blind eye to Germany's free actions. Therefore, after the announcement of the German-Japanese agreement, Germany immediately telegraphed the British government to reassure them, saying, "The German-Japanese agreement contains no secret clauses." And the "Morning Post," the mouthpiece of the British Conservative Party, also said, "The German-Japanese agreement is nothing shocking. In a word, it is nothing more than mutual cooperation to curb the malicious activities of the Communist International." With a few dismissive words, the crimes of the aggressors are brushed aside. Such an attitude can be described as the Conservatives having a tendency towards seeking kindred spirits, or as focusing only on short-term survival without any long-term vision.</p>
<p>We know that the Conservative Party's sole aim is not to eliminate war, but to keep Britain from being drawn into it. Former Prime Minister MacDonald, a quasi-Conservative New Labour bureaucrat, once stated, "Maintaining the Eastern European status quo is not our immediate concern. What we must guard against is being drawn into a war caused by a combination of France and Germany's eastern neighbor (referring to the Soviet Union)." These words reveal the entire picture of Conservative diplomacy without missing a single detail. On the first of this month, Foreign Secretary Eden's opinion on the German-Japanese agreement in the House of Commons stated that "Britain's attitude towards the agreement is to oppose the trend of dividing the world into several blocs, especially for ideological reasons. British policy still aims to promote friendship between all countries." This is also a concrete explanation of their defeatist attitude.</p>
<p>Because Britain wants to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of war and because it wants to promote so-called friendship between all countries, what it hopes for is only regional security in Western Europe. If Germany can comply with Britain's desire and guarantee Belgium's neutrality, the Conservative Party will already feel satisfied. Germany's various actions that violate treaties can be ignored and not questioned. This is Britain's attitude towards Germany. As for another ambitious country that has recently risen in the Mediterranean - Italy - its nouveau riche demeanor has already made the British uneasy during the Italian-Abyssinian War. However, under the major premise of not hindering British interests and at the same time allowing Britain to avoid being drawn into war, there is still room for compromise between Britain and Italy. We have also seen a gentlemen's agreement on Mediterranean issues put forward between London and Rome.</p>
<p>Although Britain is still clearly wandering on the political road today, the evolution of world affairs will always make Britain realize that it must make a decision. The renowned scholar Laski recently said, "The conflicts of capitalism are aggressive wars. This fact is clearly contained in the policies of the fascist powers. It is a delusion to think that we (referring to the British) can stay out of the war. The only way to prevent war is to unite with those powerful countries that have no aggressive ambitions and give the fascist powers a warning: that if they want to change borders by force, they will have to contend with the force of us and our allied countries." We believe that these words can not only serve as medicine for the British Conservatives but can also serve as a motto for the people of countries that are being invaded.</p>

<p>(Berlin) In view of the complexity of German restaurant menus, the Restaurant Association yesterday sent a letter to its members asking them to reduce the number of dishes. The letter pointed out that the more dishes there are, the greater the consumption. During this time of national thrift, simple menus should be emphasized. The letter also asked members to substitute fish for meat. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) Edward VIII's relationship with Mrs. Simpson and the Cabinet's attitude towards this matter are still at an impasse. Millions of Britons are now eagerly awaiting the opening of this deadlock. The Queen Mother is also heartbroken. The Duke and Duchess of York have returned from Scotland and are comforting her at Marlborough House. The London market opened this morning and has been affected by this matter, with everyone watching and waiting, resulting in very little trading throughout the day. According to a dispatch from Paris, after the stock exchange opened there, the pound's price immediately fell, while the price of the U.S. dollar rose sharply. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The rumors about the King's marriage to American woman Mrs. Simpson have been circulating for weeks. The whole country suddenly feels that not only will the personal happiness of the monarch, who is loved and respected by the nation, be greatly affected, but the status of the monarch himself will inevitably suffer a similar blow. Today, 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, issued a statement explaining the truth of the matter, saying that it was a constitutional dispute caused by the King's consultations with various cabinet members. According to this declaration, although it is the first official statement, the British newspapers changed their usual silence yesterday and wrote articles expressing concern that the power of the British throne might be weakening. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that there was no declaration today regarding the constitutional dispute between the King and the Cabinet, and said, "Given the current situation, it is not the time for me to respond to this matter." When Baldwin arrived at the House of Commons, the whole place cheered loudly to welcome him. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Emperor's Marriage is Not Free; Causing a City-Wide Sensation; The Prime Minister and Bishops Repeatedly Advise; Will the King Marry Mrs. Simpson with the Title of Duke of Cornwall? <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(London) King Edward's dispute with the Cabinet over his desire to marry Mrs. Simpson has made Prime Minister Baldwin possibly on the verge of resigning. Baldwin once again met with Edward today. According to reports from courtiers at Buckingham Palace, the Prime Minister asked Edward to decide on his future relationship with Mrs. Simpson within 48 hours, otherwise, Parliament would take "tough measures." It is learned that before the Prime Minister's audience, the Cabinet held a meeting and decided on a compromise solution, allowing Edward to marry Mrs. Simpson, but Mrs. Simpson could only use the title of Duchess of Cornwall. Baldwin presented this proposal to Edward, and Edward replied, "Then who is the King?" Therefore, rumors spread that Baldwin was about to resign. Newspapers here today all published editorials criticizing the King in the strongest language ever, mostly supporting the Prime Minister and wanting to prevent Mrs. Simpson from becoming Queen of England. However, most commentators also believe that the King can respect his responsibilities to the country and abandon his relationship with Mrs. Simpson. The "News Chronicle" reported that the Bishop of Bradford's speech yesterday had indicated that a major constitutional dispute had arisen between the King and the Cabinet. The problem is: "Whether Mrs. Simpson is qualified to become Queen, and whether this matter should be decided by the King or the Cabinet are all questions, but the answer to the question is not difficult. Who should be a lifelong companion? The monarch of a country is also an ordinary person and should have the right to decide for himself. Or should the Queen be determined by Parliament? If the King has the right to decide, then what is the conflict with the Cabinet's so-called constitutional problem? Moreover, the British throne is a hereditary presidential system and does not have a divine nature, so the general public may be happy to see their monarch marry the one he loves. However, there is no shortage of women who oppose divorce and American women becoming queens." If Edward insists on marrying Mrs. Simpson, the public may wish him to use the title of Duke of Cornwall. In this way, all disputes can be avoided. The "Cavalry" magazine will announce the "inside story" of this cabinet crisis tomorrow. It is said that the Prime Minister met with the King on November 25 to discuss the economic problems of South Wales. At that time, he also touched on the King's marriage issue. The Prime Minister said, "I have received strong notices from Australia, Canada, and South Africa. If Your Majesty marries Mrs. Simpson, the British Empire will be in danger of disintegration." Edward then asked the Prime Minister who was the King of England. Afterwards, Baldwin discussed with Lord Halifax, the Lord Privy Seal, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Leader of the House of Lords Earl Peel, and newspaper leader Lord Beaverbrook. A special Cabinet meeting was convened again last Friday. Now, the King has apparently decided to marry Mrs. Simpson and will force the Cabinet to obey, without abdicating. People close to the palace said that the King would meet with Mrs. Simpson today to decide on the course of action to be taken. The labor insurance company has also raised the premium for delaying the King's coronation until the end of next year, which is also very meaningful. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Some people advocate that the King's spouse does not have to be honored as Queen. If this statement becomes a reality, it will cause serious difficulties, especially the attitude of the self-governing regions towards Britain, which will be the most troublesome. The British self-governing territories are already independent in the constitution, and their only link with the mother country is the King and Queen. Therefore, a monarch marrying a commoner is unprecedented in history. The prestige of the royal family will inevitably suffer a blow, and the link between the mother country and the self-governing territories will be dissolved accordingly. Observers recently pointed this out solemnly, and representatives of the self-governing territories have also repeatedly stated this. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, Prime Minister Baldwin has proposed to the House of Commons to temporarily change today's afternoon agenda. Political figures believe that the House of Commons is taking this procedure to discuss a very important issue, which must be related to the marriage of King Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson. Although the Cabinet did not convene a meeting today, the cabinet members continued to discuss incessantly at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister first talked with the Lord Privy Seal Halifax for a long time, and then decided to talk with Liberal Party leader Sinclair and Home Secretary Simon. However, responsible sources believe that the Cabinet will never resign, because the Cabinet members believe that the King's marriage is purely a constitutional issue. (Agence Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the King resolutely refused today to wear an army uniform at the coronation ceremony. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Newspapers That Have Kept Silent Now Suddenly Discuss; A Bishop's Word Breaks the Silence; American Newspapers Report More and More Extravagantly <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(London) After Bishop Welch read the newspapers' criticisms of his speech, he told a Reuters reporter, "The actions of these people have exceeded the rights they should have. Only one sentence in my speech can be regarded as a criticism of the British Emperor. What I said, 'England needs God's grace,' is because the British Emperor seems to regard all religious conventions as insignificant on the surface, which is quite regrettable. My speech was drafted six weeks before I first heard the various rumors, so the wording in it has absolutely nothing to do with the rumors. I have been very careful to avoid mentioning the British Emperor's private life, because I don't know much about it." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers, which have kept silent about the rumors that King Edward intends to marry American woman Mrs. Simpson as his queen, have now finally been broken by the major newspapers across the country. Some newspapers spoke frankly, while others were still implicit. According to the "Daily Mail" and the "Daily Express," the matter has now reached the point of constitutional conflict, because the Emperor has expressed his intention to marry against the advice of the Cabinet. The "News Chronicle" is the only newspaper that mentioned Mrs. Simpson's name, saying that the point of contention now is whether this woman is suitable to be the Queen of England, and whether this matter will be decided by the Emperor himself or by the government representing public opinion. The "Daily Mail" also mentioned the possibility of abdication, saying that "this move will make the Emperor's loyal subjects feel extremely sad." The "Daily Mail" announced in the news column this morning that the Emperor had refused to accept the advice of ministers on matters involving his private life. Last night, Prime Minister Baldwin told the Emperor that the Cabinet was deeply concerned about the Emperor's rumored marriage plans. At a time when international affairs are in crisis, the Emperor's actions will hinder the interests of the country and the Empire. The matter is of great importance, and the cabinet members sold their advice, begging the Emperor to pay special attention to the news from several self-governing territories, which has frankly stated the attitude of their governments towards the Emperor's actions. The "Daily Mail" also learned that the Prime Minister had expressed his deep regret on behalf of the entire Cabinet, saying that the cabinet members had decided that unless an agreement could be reached, there would inevitably be a cabinet crisis and a constitutional dispute. The Cabinet believes that the best policy is for the Emperor to announce to the country that he does not want to complete this marriage.</p>
<p>(London) "The Times" today published an editorial entitled "The Emperor and the Monarch," which stated briefly that Bishop Bradford's famous speech had aroused a lot of criticism from newspapers in northern England, not only in Leeds and Bradford, but also in Manchester, Nottingham, Darlington, and Birmingham.</p>
<p>It is heard that the criticisms from the above-mentioned famous newspapers in various places are mostly based on the arguments of the two bishops. Although one or two newspapers hinted that if the Emperor's intention conflicts with the loyal advice of cabinet members, it will cause a serious constitutional dispute, most of them believe that the true value of Bishop Bradford's speech can be seen in the various declarations published in major American newspapers and some self-governing territory newspapers. We should not ignore it.</p>
<p>The newspaper continued, saying that Britain has always paid little attention to American propaganda, but now the American newspapers are becoming more and more extravagant, and their propaganda materials have involved the Emperor's private life.</p>
<p>The newspaper continued, saying that the duties of the king have never been easy, especially for a king who is middle-aged and has not yet enjoyed a happy marriage. According to general speculation, it is often thought that the Emperor's current age should be more tolerant and magnanimous than his previous emperors, and there is a feeling that the throne must be placed above public criticism. The Emperor himself should also enjoy the right to enjoy comfort and choose friends as companions. However, there is one thing that he and the whole country must consider: if his personal tendencies and public responsibilities often conflict, then the power of his high position will inevitably weaken day by day.</p>
<p>As far as the current events are concerned, the hidden dangers and dangers are self-evident. The rumors and gossip on the other side of the Atlantic have spread extremely rapidly and are no longer limited to the small scope related to the United States. As for the British newspapers, which have not seen any criticisms so far, it is only due to ordinary self-esteem and the hope that the Emperor can have an authoritative action or a formal declaration so that all rumors and gossips can be completely eliminated from the invisible. At present, such action or declaration is extremely needed, because if various rumors are allowed to exist for a long time, the result will inevitably seriously affect our country. The high position occupied by the Emperor is a sacred trust, because the whole nation's willingness to be loyal makes its maintenance power increase day by day.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned events are more important today than at any time in history. There are two reasons: first, due to the development of constitutional government in the British Empire, the responsibilities borne by the Emperor are far heavier than in the past, and the public opinion of the people in the various self-governing territories has now automatically shifted to the monarch, and regards him as the only link with the motherland. Second, due to the seriousness of the world situation, the duties of the British monarch are becoming more and more important, because he must be the mainstay in the midst of the communist and fascist tides. The situation was like this a year ago, and we hope that the situation will remain the same after the Emperor's official coronation within the next year. However, the public needs a concrete guarantee to know that this mainstay has not been shaken. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) King Edward left Buckingham Palace by car today, reportedly going to the residence of his holiday companion, Mrs. Simpson, to tell her about his meeting with Prime Minister Baldwin. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Although there is a lot of discussion and public opinion is shaken in London regarding King Edward VIII's marriage, the King's residence, Fort Belvedere, is as quiet as ever. Its location is in the center of Windsor Great Park, with ancient trees towering into the sky, adding to the tranquility. Guards protect the outside of the gate, and the gate is heavily guarded. Even messengers sent by London officials to deliver official documents for the Emperor to read are not allowed to enter the residence. As for reporters who want to probe for news, they feel that the palace gate is as deep as the sea. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) It was heard this morning that the King, after resting at Fort Belvedere, consulted with two or three close attendants and had begun to study various documents related to the issue of succession to the throne. However, members of the royal family believe that there is still room for remedy in this matter. According to official sources, the King is currently consulting with American explorer Earl Wood, who owns a ranch in Canada and intends to sell it to the King. This suggests that the King may also be considering retiring. (Agence Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) King Edward VIII's marriage is now a matter of great concern to the British government and the public. The whereabouts of the female protagonist, Mrs. Simpson, are the focus of attention of the general public. It is learned that Mrs. Simpson does not want to issue any statement and is currently resting indoors on the advice of her doctor, not taking a step outside. It is rumored that Mrs. Simpson has booked a cabin with the White Star Shipping Company and has already left the country on a certain mail ship of the company on Wednesday of this week. This statement has been denied by representatives of the company in London and Liverpool. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The front pages of various newspapers are filled with pictures of Mrs. Simpson, either in an evening dress or in sportswear. These pictures were mostly taken by the King on the yacht "Nahlin" while cruising the Adriatic coast. Above and below the pictures are titles with eye-catching wording. As for the public, who had previously been tight-lipped about the marriage, they are now openly discussing it in the streets and alleys. Crowds gathered near 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence, wanting to find out the results of the discussions of the government officials. They were driven away by mounted police who patrolled back and forth, and the crowds gradually dispersed. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to cope with the treaty-free state of the Navy next year, the United Maneuver Fleet of the First Battle Force of the Imperial Navy and the First, Second, and Third Fleets have been newly organized as follows, and announced by the Ministry of the Navy at 4 pm on the 3rd:</p>
<p>First Fleet: First Squadron - Nagato, Mutsu, Hyuga; Third Squadron - Haruna, Kirishima,</p>
<p>Second Fleet: Fourth Squadron - Takao, Maya; Fifth Squadron - Nachi, Haguro, Ashigara,</p>
<p>Second Torpedo Squadron - Jintsu, 7th Destroyer Division, 8th Destroyer Division, 19th Destroyer Division,</p>

<p>Attached Fleet: United Fleet</p>
<p>Mamiya, Naruto, Third Fleet</p>
<p>Saga. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The most noteworthy thing about the newly reorganized Japanese Navy fleet is that the First Squadron has three of the largest main battle ships, the 32,000-ton-class "Nagato," "Mutsu," and battleship "Hyuga." It is rare for the "Nagato" and "Mutsu" sister ships to be incorporated into the First Squadron at the same time. Their imposing power is the essence of the entire fleet. In addition, the Third Squadron of "Haruna" and Kirishima will demonstrate its elite power after the organization is implemented starting in fiscal year Showa 12. Also noteworthy is the newly established Twelfth Squadron of new ships such as "Okishima" and "Kamoi." (Domei, 3rd)</p>

Therefore, yesterday's search was not limited to Communist Party offices; the offices of right-wing National Volunteers were also searched. It was discovered that both sides of the Spanish civil war had sent personnel to actively operate within Belgium.

<p>Brussels - The House of Representatives recently passed the army reform bill by a vote of 137 to 43, with only eight members abstaining. The Flemish Nationalists, Communists, and a small number of Socialists voted against it. All members of the Fascist Rex Party voted in favor. The main points of this bill are four: (1) Extend the term of military service: for infantry, from twelve months to eighteen months, and for other types of soldiers, from eight months to twelve months; (2) Strengthen defensive fortifications; (3) Adopt various measures to enable rapid mobilization in the event of an emergency; (4) Recruit 6,000 volunteers. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Brussels - Prime Minister Zélande delivered a speech explaining the reasons for extending the term of military service, saying that the tense situation in Europe is unprecedented since 1914. In order to protect Belgium's security, it is necessary to extend the term of military service. Zélande went on to mention King Leopold III's speech on October 14, regarding Belgium's policy of neutrality, saying that there were two motivations for this speech: one was Germany's re-establishment of defenses along the Rhine River, and the other was the weakening of the League of Nations. Belgium is determined to participate in negotiations on the Western European Pact to promote its success, but Belgium will not renew any agreement that would hinder its policy of independence. "We will certainly honor the agreement reached by the Anglo-Franco-Belgian general staffs in London in July of this year, but this agreement is only temporary in nature. I hope that the future Western European Pact will be established quickly. As for the guarantees that our country provided to France, Britain, and Germany in 1925, they were necessary at the time, but they are no longer effective. Therefore, we cannot provide the same guarantees to those countries at this time. In short, our main responsibility is only to prevent our country from becoming a base for war."

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, Liberal MP Mond raised a question to Foreign Secretary Eden, saying that if France were to be invaded because it fulfilled the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact, or because it fulfilled its alliances with the Little Entente and Poland, would Britain also have an obligation to assist France and Belgium? Eden replied, "Britain's obligations to France and Belgium are based on the Locarno Treaty. This is clearly stipulated in the treaty and there is no doubt. Britain expects that the British obligations contained in future treaties will be consistent with those stipulated in the Locarno Treaty." (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(New York) Today, police clashed with 750 striking workers at the New York docks, resulting in eight arrests and several injuries. The workers threw stones at a streetcar and overturned a police car on the pier. The liner "Manhattan," which had been stranded here for several weeks, was originally scheduled to set sail today. At the same time, disputes have arisen within the International Labor Union, which was formed in connection with the dockworkers' strike. The French mail steamer "Chambellan," which arrived here today, was unable to unload 600 tons of cargo. Dockworkers in Cherbourg, France, recently refused to unload cargo from the Washington mail steamer to show solidarity with the American seamen's strike. However, this strike has not been recognized by the New York French Dockworkers' Union. In retaliation, the New York dockworkers refused to unload the cargo carried by the "Chambellan," except for mail and perishable goods. Therefore, the ship had to return to Europe with its original cargo. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: The Public Security Bureau of Chahar Provincial Capital, in order to maintain public order, strengthen public organization, thoroughly investigate household registration to prevent petty thieves from lurking and taking advantage of opportunities to create disturbances, and to ensure that officials and civilians are integrated without separation, and to handle matters quickly and efficiently, has formulated the "Provisional Measures for Compiling and Investigating Baojia and Household Registration under the Jurisdiction of the Chahar Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau" based on the "Regulations on Compiling and Investigating Baojia and Household Registration in Counties of Bandit Suppression Areas" promulgated by the Military Commission, and submitted it to the provincial government for implementation. It is now being actively implemented. The measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Bureau formulates these measures specifically to maintain the security of the provincial capital, strengthen public organization, thoroughly investigate household registration to prevent petty thieves from lurking and taking advantage of opportunities to create disturbances, seek integration of officials and civilians, avoid separation, and handle matters quickly. It is based on the "Regulations on Compiling and Investigating Baojia and Household Registration in Counties of Bandit Suppression Areas" promulgated by the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government in July of the 24th year of the Republic of China. (2) The Baojia areas of Chahar Provincial Capital are divided into five districts according to the police districts of each Public Security Sub-bureau. Each district has a district head, concurrently held by the sub-bureau chief. The five districts are divided into twenty-nine towns, with six towns in the first district, six towns in the second district, eight towns in the third district, six towns in the fourth district, and three towns in the fifth district. Each town has a town head. The household registration within the town is based on the household as a unit, with a household head. Ten households form a Jia, with a Jia head. Ten Jia form a Bao, with a Bao head. The election of the town, Bao, and Jia heads is done as follows: the Jia head is publicly elected by the household heads within the Jia, the Bao head is publicly elected by the Jia heads within the Bao, and the town head is publicly elected by the Bao heads within the town. (The town head can also serve as Bao head, and the Bao head can also serve as Jia head.) However, a meeting of the sub-bureau chiefs and stationed patrol officers must be convened in advance to not only divide the areas of each town, but also instruct the stationed patrol officers to be responsible for planning the boundaries of each Baojia in order to facilitate the election. Anyone with one of the following conditions is not allowed to be elected as town, Bao, or Jia head: (Zi) Those under the age of twenty years; (Chou) Those who have not resided in this port for three years and have no legitimate occupation; (Yin) Those with bad habits; (Mao) Those with unclear backgrounds; (Chen) Those with mental illness; (Ji) Those who are illiterate; (Wu) Those who have harmed the Republic of China or acted as local tyrants and bullies and have been sentenced; (Wei) Those who have been deprived of civil rights. (3) The organization of Baojia must be based on household registration, customs, terrain, and other special circumstances, and organized according to the following methods: (Zi) The organization of each household, Jia, and Bao should start from one side and organize adjacent houses in sequential order; (Chou) For the remaining households that do not make up a Jia, those with six or more households may form a separate Jia, and those with five or fewer households should be incorporated into a neighboring Jia. The same applies to the remaining Jia; (Yin) The investigation of temples within each district will be subject to separate regulations. The investigation of household registration shall be supervised by the chiefs of each Public Security Sub-bureau (and district heads). The procedure is as follows: (Zi) After the household registration is determined, the head should thoroughly implement the investigation together with the household heads to ensure that the organization matches the actual situation; (Chou) After each Bao is determined, the town head should implement a review together with the stationed patrol officer; (Yin) After each town is determined, the chief of the Public Security Sub-bureau (and district head) should conduct a serious review; (Mao) After each district is determined, the Bureau will send personnel to review with the town and Bao heads. (5) After the household registration is determined, Baojia doorplates will be issued separately and affixed to the upper end of the street door. They must not be lost or damaged. If there is any loss, report it to the town office for reissuance. The household registration of each household should be filled out truthfully at the same time, and there must be no concealment or false reporting. The investigation form should be personally imprinted by the household head of each household to ensure responsibility. (The doorplate style will be determined separately.) (6) Any increase, decrease, or change in the household must be reported immediately: household to Jia, Jia to Bao, Bao to town, town to the stationed police in their jurisdiction. The stationed police report the household change form to the district (i.e., Public Security Sub-bureau) on a monthly basis. The district then compiles the household change form within its jurisdiction and reports it to the General Bureau. However, the time from the household to the stationed police must not exceed forty-eight hours. (The reporting form will be ordered separately, and the reporting method will be specified when the meeting is convened.) (7) After the Baojia is determined, household registration may increase or decrease from time to time, and Baojia should be added or merged separately at the end of the year as required. (8) After the district and town heads are recommended, the Bureau will add an appointment and issue an official seal. After the Bao and Jia heads are recommended, they may be appointed by the district head. (9) If the district head finds that the town, Bao, or Jia head is incompetent or believes that a replacement is necessary, they may report to the Bureau for approval and re-election by the original recommender. However, if any town head has illegal behavior, or if the Jia head believes that the Bao head has illegal behavior, they may directly report to the Bureau in a joint name, and a re-election will be held after verification. (10) After the Baojia is determined, the district head should convene a Baojia meeting of town, Bao, and Jia heads together with the chief police officers and officers of the Public Security Sub-bureau to discuss and abide by the Baojia regulations. The regulations should be formulated on the following matters: (Zi) Matters concerning the functions and office locations of district, town, Bao, and Jia heads, as well as the names and order of each district, town, Bao, and Jia; (Chou) Matters concerning the compilation of doorplates and investigation of household registration; (Yin) Matters concerning the inspection and banning of people entering and leaving the territory; (Mao) Matters concerning water and fire rescue and alert; (Chen) Matters concerning the notification and search of bandit disasters; (Ji) Matters concerning the protection of highways, telephone poles, bridges, and all transportation; (Wu) Necessary matters concerning maintaining local security; (Wei) Matters concerning the date of convening meetings, the number of decisions, and the method of convening emergency meetings. (11) After the Baojia regulations are formulated, all district, town, Bao, and Jia heads should sign and report them to the Bureau for record. (12) The powers of the Jia, Bao, town, and district heads are as follows: (Zi) Jia head: 1. Responsible for maintaining the security and order within the Jia under the command and supervision of the Bao head; 2. Assist the Bao head in performing duties; 3. Investigate the household registration within the Jia, compile doorplates, and obtain joint security and joint liability undertakings; 4. Assist the police in searching for and arresting criminals; 5. Advise residents not to engage in illegal activities; 6. Inspect traitors and investigate the entry and exit of people. (Chou) Bao head: 1. The Bao head is responsible for maintaining local security under the command and supervision of the town head; 2. Supervise the Jia heads in performing their duties; 3. Assist the town head in performing their duties; 4. Advise residents not to engage in illegal activities; 5. Assist the police in searching for and arresting bandits; 6. Report bandits; 7. Other important matters concerning local security. (Yin) Town head: 1. The town head is responsible for maintaining local security; 2. Examine the diligence of the Bao and Jia heads; 3. Improve local relations and public security under the command of the district head; 4. Jointly inspect the household registration of each Baojia with the patrol officer to see if there are any omissions or concealments. (13) If each Baojia head discovers bandits, they should report it immediately and must not conceal it. Otherwise, they will be held jointly liable for colluding with bandits. If the residents find that each Baojia head has concealed bandits, they may report it jointly and have it investigated and handled, but there must be no acts of taking revenge or looking at faces. (14) Each household should jointly provide a joint security and joint liability undertaking with the households within the Baojia. The same applies to the town and Bao heads. (15) If residents within each Baojia have firearms, they should report to the Bureau for inspection, issue a license, brand them, and register them. Violators will be punished as illegally possessing military weapons. (16) In order to save expenses, the Bureau has decided that the district head will be concurrently held by the chief of each sub-bureau and will not be paid a separate public fee. The town head may set up a town office, and the Bureau will issue 10 yuan in office expenses per month, and the sub-bureau will allocate a capable police officer to assist the town head in handling clerical and communication matters. Each Baojia head will work at their home, but there is no public fee. (17) The term of office for district, town, Bao, and Jia heads is limited to one year. If they perform well, they may be reappointed. (18) Each district, town, Bao, and Jia head must be absolutely responsible for all matters in their respective areas and must not shirk responsibility or be absent arbitrarily when summoned. (19) Chahar Province is in a special position, and its district, town, Bao, and Jia heads must absolutely keep secrets when dealing with external matters. (20) If there are confidential matters that should not be announced, and the district, town, Bao, and Jia heads leak them, they will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. (21) If each district, town, Bao, and Jia head fails to fulfill their responsibilities, they will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. (22) If each district, town, Bao, and Jia head abuses their powers, accepts bribes, or delays important official duties, the district head may report to the Bureau according to the circumstances and punish them according to law. (23) If each town and Bao head encounters one of the following situations, the district head may report to the Bureau for separate rewards and punishments: (Zi) Those who detect the intention of bandits to invade and report it quickly, thus preserving the public security of the provincial capital; (Chou) Those who uncover important organs of bandits and other illegal elements, or who capture them due to reporting, and are interrogated and dealt with according to law; (Yin) Those who seize illegally hidden military weapons; (Mao) Those who assist the military and police in capturing bandits; (Chen) Those whose Baojia boundaries have accurate populations and who handle matters seriously. (24) The methods of reporting matters by each district, town, and Bao head are listed below: (Zi) If illegal or reactionary elements are detected within the boundary, they must be reported clearly and secretly according to the severity and urgency of the circumstances; (Chou) In the event of special emergencies, if there is any delay, which may lead to major changes, each town and Bao head may report directly to the Bureau or the district (face-to-face reports are also acceptable) in order to be agile and avoid delaying important official duties; (Yin) All personnel involved in confidential reporting should strictly keep secrets. If it is found that there is any leakage of confidential information, they will be severely punished. (25) If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they may be temporarily requested to be amended. (26) These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval. (30) Shop assistant Wang Peilin entered the shop at the age of sixteen as an apprentice and has been there for ten years. The relationship between guest and host is still fairly harmonious, but his nature is quite stingy and he is unwilling to be accommodating with money. He also does not issue year-end dividends. Disappointed, Wang could not help but hold a grudge. Guo had two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Wenyu, is now six years old and attends Anduo Elementary School in Special District Three. He is intelligent and loved by his father. At 10:00 a.m. on November 29, Wenyu came to the shop from his residence and was seen by Wang, who suddenly had a murderous intent. Taking advantage of the unpreparedness, he lured him to the black room next to the Bankers Association’s ball field where new photo negatives were stored. He untied his white silk trouser belt and strangled Wenyu in the box in five minutes. He still locked the black room and calmly returned to the shop, upstairs to serve as usual. Guo did not see his son and asked the shop assistants, all of whom said they did not know. Wang said that he had seen two acquaintances take him away and even named the people to confirm it. Guo did not suspect anything. At 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, Wang went to a friend's banquet at Weiyu Villa in the French Concession. At 6:00 p.m., he even called Guo, saying that his son had been found, but he needed to prepare 5,000 yuan to redeem him. Only then did Guo realize that something was wrong, but he only suspected kidnapping and did not expect the tragedy. He reported the situation of kidnapping and extortion to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and detectives were sent out, but there was no effect. However, Wang seemed to be acting on impulse and had no plan. He had no money and could not go far. After the banquet at Weiyu, he crossed the river alone and wandered in the streets of Wuchang for a day and night. On the evening of the 30th, he still crossed the Han River and entered the Hailand Hotel on Jianghan Road. As soon as he opened the room, detectives arrived. When he crossed the river, detectives from the Public Security Bureau had been waiting on the Jianggan side with his photo, so it was not difficult to find him by picture. After Wang was arrested, he personally wrote a simple confession in the hotel, directly admitting that Wenyu had been strangled to death and hidden in a box in the dark room. He also admitted his outrageous behavior.</p>
<h3 id="e68">A Shocking Box Corpse Case Occurs in Hankou; Six-Year-Old Young Master of Qixin Photo Studio Tragically Strangled; Corpse Hidden in a Box, Extortion of Huge Sums by Phone; Murderer is a Young Shop Assistant Who Claims to Be Seeking Revenge <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: A shocking murder case recently occurred in Hankou. The murderer is a young shop assistant who used extremely cruel methods on the young master, who was only six years old. After hiding the body in a box, he even extorted huge sums of money from the shop owner by phone. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau mobilized urgently, the case was quickly solved. The bizarre case spread throughout Wuhan. Guo Zhiyi, a native of Wuxi, Jiangsu, opened the Qixin Photo Studio on Jianghan Road in Special District Three of Hankou City. He has been in business for ten years and has accumulated huge wealth. The studio employs many shop assistants, one of whom is responsible for repairing negatives and does not want to involve others. He also said that the great revenge has been avenged and he has no regrets even if he dies. Later, he was escorted to the General Bureau and talked eloquently and vividly. After hearing the news, Guo rushed to the black room and found Wenyu's body in the box. The strangulation marks on his neck were very deep, and blood was flowing from all seven orifices, which was unbearable to watch. The Hankou Local Court was dispatched to inspect the body and confirmed that he had been strangled to death before his death. Wang's confession at the Public Security Bureau was as follows: "The Qixin Photo Studio was originally formed by five or six shareholders. Shop assistants usually have dividends. Later, the shareholders withdrew, and Tong Zhiyi operated it independently. The business became increasingly prosperous, but Guo was stingy and did not distribute the dividends. My grandmother was seriously ill and urged me to return to my hometown. Guo initially refused to lend me travel expenses. After pleading, he only lent me fifty yuan and made me write two IOUs. When I came to Hankou from Wuxi, I unfortunately fell ill. Guo initially promised to give me one yuan for medical expenses, but after repeated requests, he gave me three yuan and often humiliated and ridiculed me, so I held a grudge. At 10:00 a.m. on the 29th, the young master came to the shop, so I led him to the empty room where Qixin Photo Enlargement was done and strangled him with my trouser belt. He died in five minutes. I still returned to the shop to work. At 4:00 p.m., I went to a banquet at Weiyu Restaurant. After the banquet, I spoke to the shop owner on the phone. I first asked if the young master had returned to the shop. He replied that he had not returned. I said that he might not be able to return home for two or three days and said that he should prepare 5,000 yuan. When he heard this, he was very anxious and told me to return to the shop immediately, otherwise he would report to the Garrison Headquarters. I ignored him and crossed the river. I asked him for money just to make him happy and had no other intentions. After arriving in Wuchang, I only wandered on the road. I returned to Hankou and was arrested at the Hailand Hotel because I had no money, so I couldn't escape." There are two suspicious points in this case: (1) Stinginess in issuing wages and not giving dividends is not a deep hatred, so why kill his son? (2) Since he killed his son, why notify him by phone, which is equivalent to admitting it himself, and dare to publicly travel back and forth to Wuhan? Therefore, there are other reasons to suspect the origin of the murderous intent. (December 2)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Songjiang: Business Community Requests Reduction in Electricity Fees <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The local electricity company originally sold electricity at 25 cents per unit, and merchants already felt that the electricity charges were too high. They had previously discussed requesting a reduction, but at that time they were preparing to connect electricity to Shanghai, so they waited until the Songjiang-Shanghai electricity connection was completed. Now that Shanghai electricity has been transmitted, the business community believes that the local electricity price is too high and has asked the Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the electricity company authorities. The County Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees the other day to discuss the issue of reducing electricity fees. The meeting decided to convene various guilds on a regular basis and send a letter to the electricity company inviting them to attend and discuss the extent of the reduction. It also discussed the methods for our business community to express itself regarding bandit suppression and pacification, and notified various guilds and shops to collect one day's income from both labor and capital, with the capital side used to慰勞 the soldiers at the front and the labor side used for the frugality movement, with a deadline for submission to the Chamber of Commerce for separate forwarding. A one-day movement committee was also formed, with the executive and supervisory committee members of the Chamber of Commerce and the chairmen of various guilds as members, to provide guidance.</p>

<p>The Second District Commissioner's Office previously received telegrams from the Provincial Civil Affairs Department and the National Anti-Smoking Commissioner, stating that the anti-drug deadline had expired. Starting from the 26th year, anyone who manufactures, sells, or smokes drugs would be sentenced to death. However, there are still many ignorant people in various places who have not awakened and reformed. The propaganda work has not been able to penetrate into the folk and promote their awareness.

<p>According to Dagongshe, after the Shanghai Municipal Government learned that Jiading County had confiscated rice boats passing through the area, causing panic among Shanghai residents regarding their food supply, it telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, requesting their immediate release. Representatives from Shanghai's rice industry associations are engaging in negotiations. The northern part of Shanghai has suspended rice trading due to the interruption of river rice supplies. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>Members of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, Qiang Zisheng and Fu Qiangeng; members of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, Jiang Shizhi; and director of the Changshu Guild, Shi Zufu, went to the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday morning to petition. They requested that the Jiangsu Provincial Government be telegraphed to order the Jiading County Government to release the detained rice boats from various counties, such as Xichangchang and Kun, at the Jiwang Temple area, to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents. The representatives then, at 5 p.m., carried a letter of introduction from the Bureau of Social Affairs and went to the Jiading County Government to meet County Magistrate Guo Yaofeng, requesting their immediate release. Magistrate Guo expressed earnestly that he greatly valued the food supply for Shanghai residents, but was bound by provincial orders and had to await a reply from the province before releasing them.</p>
<p>Telegraph to Jiangsu for Release</p>
<p>After receiving the reports and requests from the petitioning representatives of the rice industry associations yesterday morning, the Municipal Government telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting the immediate release of the rice boats detained in Jiading County. Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, also telegraphed Yu Jingtang, the director of the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs, requesting him to follow the domestic food circulation measures passed by the Executive Yuan and order the Jiading County Government to release the boats immediately to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents. At the same time, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, local coordination associations, and other organizations also sent telegrams to the Jiangsu provincial authorities.</p>
<p>Northern Shanghai Market Suspended</p>
<p>Currently, over 180 rice boats have been detained in the Jiwang Temple area of Wusong Port, causing navigation to be blocked. The northern Shanghai rice market has suspended trading because the original river rice supply has been cut off and the source is being confiscated, causing rice prices to rise by another 20-30 cents yesterday. Since the river rice was unloaded at the close of the market at 3 p.m. yesterday, there is no way to trade this morning, so it is necessary to temporarily suspend the market.</p>
<p>Various Counties Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Jiading County Jiwang Temple confiscated a large number of rice boats, merchants from various inland counties are extremely panicked. To investigate the truth about the confiscated rice boats, rice industry associations from Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Wujiang, Kunshan, and other counties have sent representatives to Shanghai to discuss countermeasures with Shanghai's rice industry organizations.</p>

<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Central Bank yesterday on business, intending to meet with Vice President Kong, but he was not there. Upon inquiring with a secretary, it was learned that Minister Kong had previously taken leave to treat his heart disease. According to the doctor, he should have taken a longer period of rest, but Kong felt that his responsibilities were too great and did not want to harm the public interest for personal gain. Even during his treatment, he continued to handle important affairs of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank while leaning on his bed. Two weeks ago, feeling that the national crisis was serious and his personal responsibilities were even greater, he disobeyed the doctor's orders and went out to the Central Bank to work every day despite his illness. He originally planned to go to the capital soon, but the doctor insisted that his heart condition would be aggravated by the vibrations of the train, so it did not happen. Yesterday morning (the 2nd), he went to the bank as usual and was about to summon his staff to handle official business when he suddenly felt dizzy and had chills all over his body. He hurried back to his residence to call a doctor, who said that his original illness had not recovered and was compounded by a cold. After taking medication, his fever gradually subsided this morning (the 3rd). He is avoiding wind as per the doctor's orders, so he did not go to work yesterday.</p>

However, his condition is still in a critical stage, and whether he can be saved depends on whether there are any changes within the next three days. The report from the Japanese Domei News Agency last night that Huang had died of illness at his residence at 2:30 p.m. on the third is completely inaccurate. Dr. Fan Shisheng has denied it.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Ding Peilai Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, when the Shanghai Youth Club held a luncheon at the American Club yesterday afternoon (the 2nd), Ding Peilai, the correspondent for the British Manchester Guardian and various important American publications, spoke about the important changes in Sino-Japanese relations in the past year, stating briefly that the situation between China and Japan had undergone significant changes in the past year for various reasons. One of the reasons for the change in Japan's policy towards China was the victory of President Chiang in resolving the Southwest dispute. This move not only greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people but also eliminated the risk of internal divisions in the event of war with Japan. The military strength of the central government has greatly increased as a result, allowing it to cope with Japanese aggression. For this reason, Foreign Minister Zhang Qun was able to respond to the formidable demands made by Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe in October with a number of counter-demands. This is the first time since 1931 that China has dared to confront Japan. President Chiang recently held multiple meetings with northern leaders such as Han Fuju and Yan Xishan, and their opinions were in agreement. The central government also participated in the defense of Suiyuan to resist the mixed forces of Mongols and bandits, seemingly aided by Japan. This is also clear evidence of China's increasing internal unity. During this period, the central government's finances also became more stable, and military funding increased daily. The above points are indeed of great significance to the overall situation, but Japan's moderate attitude towards several major incidents between China and Japan is not entirely due to this. At the end of this autumn, a total of five Japanese residents were killed and four were injured in various places in China. In the past, any one of these incidents would have been enough for the Japanese to take the opportunity to implement severe actions under the pretext. The reason why Japan has been restrained is that while China's internal strength is increasing, Japan's internal situation is deteriorating. Ding then cited facts to draw the audience's attention to the exposure of Japan's domestic weaknesses in February of this year, saying that the real key to this matter lies in the serious difficulties Japan is encountering in its political, economic, and social aspects. After detailing the historical background of these weaknesses, Ding went on to discuss Japan's financial difficulties, saying that by the end of 1936, Japan's total debt was several times greater than it had been five years earlier. The national debt borne by each Japanese citizen was previously lower than that borne by the people of Britain, France, and the United States, but now it is increasing by 1 billion yen per year, which is shocking to hear. If the military had not moderated its financial demands, the trend would have continued to increase, but the military's attitude is tough, and it seems unlikely that it will be willing to do so at present. Ding then went on to describe the large increase in military spending in Japan's budget, saying that the authorities are about to levy new taxes to make up for this sharp increase in expenditure. Finance Minister Baba has proposed a financial reform plan aimed at complying with the military's demands, but the public strongly opposes it because it will increase their burden. The business community is also very disapproving. Japan's massive increase in military buildup is actually due to fear of Soviet Russia. Since 1931, the Red Army in eastern Siberia has increased from six divisions to about 250,000 men, and their combat equipment is complete, including long-range bombers that can threaten Japan's major industrial areas. The large increase in Soviet military strength is sufficient to affect Japan's position in China. All Japanese leaders know that if Soviet Russia continues to develop its Far Eastern military strength, Japan will find it difficult to implement its development policy on the Asian continent, and they fear that their position in Manchuria will also be threatened. Furthermore, Japan is gradually realizing that pacifying Manchuria is not easy. Since 1931, Japan has spent 1 billion yen in Manchuria. During this period, no fewer than 5,000 Japanese soldiers have died, and another 200,000 have either been injured or have returned home from Manchuria due to illness. Ding finally touched on the expansion of China's internal strength, saying that its state makes it difficult for Japan to act rashly in North China. The Western powers, especially Great Britain, are now concerned about China's affairs, which is sufficient to overturn some of Japan's assumptions and disappoint it.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Italian Embassy in China Denies Recognizing Manchukuo, States that the Consulate in Shenyang is Merely Being Reopened, an Administrative Measure That Cannot Be Seen as Recognition —Lojacono Explains to the Press in Geneva— <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the *Xin Sheng She*, Italy and Japan have formally announced the establishment of the agreement between the two parties in a public statement. However, regarding the exchange of recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and Manchukuo, it only mentioned that Japan would close its embassy in Abyssinia and establish a consulate in Addis Ababa, avoiding mentioning Italy's establishment of a consulate in Shenyang and instead issuing a written statement. Yesterday, a reporter from *Xin Sheng She* inquired again at the Italian Embassy in Shanghai about everything. Mr. Ross, the Chinese Secretary, came out to meet him. Mr. Ross still denied that Italy had recognized Manchukuo, saying that the Italian government would definitely not formally recognize Manchukuo. Italy had originally established a consulate in Shenyang, which was later closed. This time, it is only planned to be reopened, not newly established. This is a change in administrative measures and cannot be immediately regarded as recognition of Manchukuo. So far, no government statement has been received here. Regarding this matter, Ambassador Lojacono will hold a press conference in Geneva within days to explain it in detail.</p>

<p>The anti-drug affairs of this city are the responsibility of the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, the Public Security Bureau, and other agencies. The procedures for smokers to obtain licenses have been handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Public Security Branch Bureaus and Teams, which have achieved considerable results. More than 40,000 people received smoker licenses in the second period. The period for exchanging the third period smoke licenses began on the 1st of last month and was originally scheduled to end at the end of last month. Later, because more than 30,000 smokers went to exchange their smoke licenses within the deadline, some smokers did not have time to exchange them. The authorities specially considered this and extended the deadline for another month, until the end of this month. No further extensions will be granted, and old licenses will be invalidated if they are not exchanged after the deadline, and they will be prosecuted for private smoking. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued a public notice to inform the smokers of this city in order to avoid them committing crimes due to exceeding the deadline, which would lead to regret.</p>

All fields released before May 1929 that have not been enclosed and for which the field price is paid before January 20, 1937, will still be allowed to collect at half price.

<h3 id="e111">The City's Two Grain Associations Submit to the Yuan and Ministry Not to Approve Exemption from Import Tax on Foreign Rice; Completion of the Yuehan Road Greatly Facilitates the Transportation of Grain to Lingnan; Good Harvests in Various Places This Year are Suitable for Circulation and Regulation <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean Rice Industry and Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Industry Associations believe that the reports that Guangdong Province has again telegraphed the central government to exempt import taxes on foreign rice, if approved, will not only leak out rights and interests, but also put farmers in the producing areas in a desperate situation. Therefore, yesterday they sent separate telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, requesting that they not approve the exemption in order to reassure the people. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanjing sent to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry: I recently read in the newspaper the resolution of the Executive Yuan regarding the request of various provinces and cities to prohibit the export of food, stating that food should be allowed to circulate freely within the country in order to balance supply and demand and gradually reach equilibrium. The measures proposed by various provinces and cities to restrict the export of food are not in line with economic principles or the central government's purpose of coordinating food management and are not approved. I have seen the government's intention to regulate food and protect the countryside. Recently, I heard that Guangdong Province has again proposed to exempt taxes on foreign rice, which has caused great confusion. The taxation of foreign rice started in the winter of 1933, but Guangdong Province was only able to unify the collection of taxes this year. Although Guangdong Province is a rice-deficient area, since the completion of the Yuehan Railway, rice and grain from various provinces in the Yangtze River Basin have been transported directly to Lingnan by rail and rail, which is very convenient. Rather than relying on foreign rice, it is better to obtain resources from the mainland. Moreover, there have been good harvests in various places this year, and the long-depleted rural economy has gradually shown signs of recovery. It is expected that the provinces and cities will ban the export of rice, causing rice shortages in the rice-deficient areas, high rice prices that harm the people, and low grain prices that harm farmers in the rice-producing areas. Fortunately, the central government does not approve this, allowing free circulation and balancing supply and demand. However, Guangdong Province wants to exempt taxes on foreign rice, which will not only leak out rights and interests, causing great concern, but also cause farmers in the producing areas to face obstacles to sales and fall into a desperate situation. With such obstacles, how can the rural economy be restored? Furthermore, it is not in line with economic principles or the central government's purpose of coordinating food management. Therefore, I do not avoid the risk of offending you and telegraphed to request that the chiefs review and approve the section of Guangdong Province requesting exemption from foreign rice tax and not approve it. I am extremely grateful. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Soybean Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Industry Association. Jiang.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Dr. Hu Shih's Speech Yesterday: The Changing Pacific - Japanese Aggression Against China Will Lead to World War <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Dr. Hu Shih, Dean of the College of Arts of Peking University, returned from attending the Pacific Conference as a representative of China. Last night at 8 o'clock, he was hosted by the International Relations Research Association, the Pacific Society, and the Joint Association of University Faculty at the International Hotel's second-floor dining hall. At about 10 o'clock, he began to deliver a speech in English to a crowded audience. The topic was "The Evolving Pacific." Dr. Hu first stated that he wanted to express a "New Pacific" in his speech. The so-called "New Pacific" refers to the evolution of the balance of power in the Pacific since 1931 and a comparison with the situation of Japan's supreme power from 1914 to 1931. The general perception is that Japan still enjoys supreme power in the Far East. This view is actually wrong. Seventeen years ago, from the outbreak of the European War until the Manchurian Incident in 1931, Japan did indeed enjoy supreme power in the Far East. During the European War, the overall situation in the Far East was entirely in the hands of Japan. Japan took the opportunity to drive out German forces from the Chinese coast and the Pacific. By 1921, the Washington Conference produced the so-called Washington Treaty, but Japan's position in the Western Hemisphere remained largely unchanged. It was not until 1931, when Japan abused its power in the Western Pacific, that its power began to decline. Dr. Hu continued, stating that China's unification was actually promoted by Japanese aggression. Japan's unlimited aggression against China may lead to a world war, and all countries in the Pacific will be drawn into the vortex. Although the countries of the Pacific love peace, the aggressive warlords will inevitably drive them into war. Wise politicians may be able to discern the evolution of the balance of power and make peaceful adjustments, that is, establish a Pacific regional peace mechanism based on the new balance of power. The United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, and China can all participate, seeking ways to adjust difficult issues to maintain the collective security of the entire Pacific. If not, the outbreak of a world war will be inevitable, and the terror of that war will be beyond our imagination.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Committee for Raising Funds to Purchase Aircraft to Present to the Government as a Memorial for Chairman Chiang's 50th Birthday previously received a proposal from Yao Songnian. Since real estate accounts for the majority of properties in Shanghai, it was proposed to promote a one-day movement in the real estate sector, extracting and donating funds to purchase aircraft for birthday greetings. The Committee considered it feasible and sent letters to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Joint Association of the First and Second Special Districts, and the Shanghai Committee for the Promotion of the Movement for National Contribution of One Day's Income to vigorously promote it. It is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied yesterday, stating that the proposal to promote a one-day movement in the real estate industry to extract donations has been recorded and forwarded to the Real Estate Trade Association for consultation, requesting its leadership and vigorous promotion. In addition, the Committee received donations yesterday from Zhang Yeping Coal Mining Company, 200 yuan; the National Association of the Chinese Young Women's Christian Association, 100 yuan; Jinan University, 54 yuan and 7 fen; the Hunam District Fire Brigade Joint Association, 100 yuan; the Ningbo Association, a continuation of 5,000 yuan; Qingliang Temple's Venerable Qinghai, 30 yuan; the Overseas Chinese Shandong Association, 233 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen; and the Overseas Chinese Patriotic Association, 608 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen. Acknowledgement receipts have been issued. In addition, the Shanghai Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association, in order to enrich the exhibition hall, has been soliciting photographs, aircraft models, and aviation books from various airlines and bookstores. Yesterday, Li Dachao, the chief secretary of the association, received a letter from General Manager Dai of Eurasia Aviation, sending six photographs of various aircraft, for which thanks have been expressed. Also, Mr. Wilson agreed to donate an aircraft model. Mayor Wu instructed Secretary Li Xiangan to send someone to retrieve it and sent a letter of thanks.</p>

<p>Lu Fuji Construction Factory at 304 Xietu Road in the Nanshi area was recently contracted to build a house for the Ju family at the Yanjiabiao site on Peidong Ditch Road.

<h3 id="e116">Expansion of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate - Promotion of Wang Dasui to Director <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since Director Cai Jingjun took office at the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, he has made many rectifications to Shanghai's police administration, achieving remarkable results. Recently, Director Cai reported to the Municipal Government that the Bureau's original Inspectorate only had one chief inspector and one deputy chief inspector, and that the inspectors of the various sub-bureaus and teams were working hard day and night, leading to intense work. He requested and received approval from the Municipal Government to expand the organization of the Inspectorate, which will now have one director and three chief inspectors, divided into eight sections to handle affairs. The candidate for director is Wang Dasui, the original chief inspector, and Dong Guangfu, Wang Weiming, and Ruan Yongqi have been transferred and appointed as chief inspectors of the eight sections. The list of directors for each section, it is reported, has already been internally determined and will be announced soon. The aforementioned expanded organization was implemented on the 3rd. The brief biographies of the individuals are as follows: Wang Dasui is a graduate of Tsinghua School in Beijing and holds a master's degree from the University of Michigan in the United States. He served as the chief of the Secretariat Section of the Capital Police Department. In 1929, he was appointed as a Chinese delegate to the Fifth International Police Conference in Paris and inspected the police administration of various European countries. After returning to China in 1930, he served as the principal of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy, a member of the Police Administration Specialist Committee of the Ministry of Interior, a member of the First Higher Examination Committee, and the director of the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital of Gansu Province. Dong Guangfu holds a master's degree in law from the National University of Toulouse in France. Wang Weiming is a graduate of the 18th class of the Japanese Army Academy. Ruan Yongqi is a graduate of the 7th class of the Army University.</p>

<p>The Yuanyuan and Yuanji silk reeling factories on Hutai Road in Zhabei were unable to operate due to a lack of raw materials and announced their closure on October 29. However, the salaries of the employees of the two factories had not been paid, causing an outcry from the workers, who petitioned the Party and government agencies and were repeatedly summoned for mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs, but without result. Now, the Sixth District Silk Reeling Union sent personnel to negotiate with the factories. The factories sent representatives Zhou Jinbao and Sun Yongyuan to directly negotiate with the local authorities. As a result, the factories agreed to issue two and a half months' pay to all employees at their original salaries. The workers expressed their agreement, and a written record of the settlement was signed, announcing the resolution. Both labor and management presented the case to the Party and government agencies, requesting that the case be closed.</p>
<h3 id="e118">New Pharmaceutical Industry Prohibits Domestic Drugs from Impersonating Foreign Merchants <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations yesterday issued a notice to all members nationwide stating that at the Federation's second general membership meeting, Zhou Bangjun proposed, with the joint signatures of Hu Zhaoxiang, Tu Kaizheng, Xu Xiangsun, Xu Xiaochu, Gao Peiliang, Zhu Yuquan, Xu Chao, Zhou Mengbai, and others, to prohibit domestically operated new pharmaceutical companies from impersonating foreign merchants and certain foreign goods in order to uphold the dignity of the nation. The worship of foreign goods is a great shame for our Chinese nation. Our countrymen are currently occupied with their own troubles, yet some of our colleagues in the new pharmaceutical industry are disregarding the overall situation and promoting this practice. Such a loss of conscience is deeply regrettable. The reason for this is nothing more than taking advantage of the Chinese people's mentality of worshiping imported goods to achieve their own desire for profit. Therefore, some domestically operated new pharmaceutical companies hang up foreign company signs, setting a precedent for a strange phenomenon unheard of in other countries, and causing the nation's dignity to be swept away. In order to safeguard the dignity of the nation, to eradicate the evil roots of the nation, and to enhance the character and status of our colleagues in the new pharmaceutical industry, it is necessary to strictly prohibit this practice. Therefore, the general meeting resolved in principle to pass the notice and inform all members to pay close attention and record it.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Cai Xiahu's Children Sue for Division of Property After His Death <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Cai Xiahu, a native of Chuansha, came from a poor background and worked hard to build his business. He opened the Huishi Deng Milk Company on Xin Dagulu Road for more than ten years and accumulated assets worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. He had a son, Cai Qiuquan, who is now 38 years old, and a daughter, Cai Xiuzhen, who has married into the Li family. Qiuquan is also married to Sun Xiulin, and their children were born to Cai's first wife. Cai's second wife, Ms. Yang, is currently 46 years old. Cai enjoyed both wealth and happiness, and was expecting to enjoy a happy old age, but fate had it that he only had the ability to create wealth but not to enjoy it. He fell ill and died, leaving behind a legacy of poison, leading to litigation after his death. All of his assets were controlled by his stepmother, Ms. Yang, and his wife, Sun Xiulin, who lived a life of leisure, better than immortals. Cai Qiuquan, on the other hand, wandered around and was in dire straits. Unable to afford to sue on his own, he joined his sister, Li Cai Xiuzhen, in hiring two lawyers, Xi Mengqi and Jiang Yiping, to file a petition with the local court for the division of the estate, stating that the assets currently identified amount to 280,000 yuan, and that there are many more assets that have not yet been identified, and will be reported later. All the assets in this case should be divided into three shares for the mother and children, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Tang held a hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Tingrui, who stated in court that his client did not object to the division of the estate into three shares, but that it was necessary to review whether the asset list submitted by the plaintiff matched the assets held by the defendant. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that if the submitted asset list did not match the defendant's, then it would be best for the defendant to hand over all the assets left by Cai Xiahu for division, and also to submit the will for reference. The judge then instructed both parties that since there was no dispute over the division of assets, the issue of the total amount was easy to resolve and they should attempt to settle out of court before further review, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Ye Qinghua, 38 years old this year, is the younger brother of Ye Qinghe, a notorious international drug trafficker who is currently on the run. Ye was a teacher at Xiamen Jimei School when he met Wu Yu, a woman from his hometown. Later, Wu came to Shanghai to study at the Tongde Obstetrics School, and Ye was also in Shanghai. They fell in love as teacher and student and began living together, and have since had two daughters. Recently, Ye abandoned Wu, and Wu filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Ye Qinghua of seduction, obstructing public morals, and abandoning his mother and daughters. Based on the complaint, the court issued a warrant ordering Wu to escort the bailiff to summon Ye, but they did not find him. Ye's wife and her friend Chen Rong went to the Dacheng Apartment and beat Wu, causing her injuries. Wu filed a complaint with the court requesting an examination of her injuries and accused Ye's wife, Yang Zhuxia (also known as Lai Xiang), and Chen Rong of assault. Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Special Court has already held a hearing, summoning both parties to court and consolidating the two cases for trial. The hearing was adjourned pending the summoning of witnesses. Yesterday, the case was reconvened for a continued hearing. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers, but the second defendant in the assault case, Chen Rong, did not appear. After a brief hearing of both parties, the witness Xu Wangaiyu was summoned, who testified, "I live in the Dacheng Apartment, and Wu Yu also lives there, so I know her. That day, she (referring to Yang Zhuxia) came to my room with a woman (presumably Chen Rong). Wu happened to be in my room. I saw them and invited them in, poured tea, and asked them to sit down. They did not say a word and immediately beat Wu. People persuaded them to stop, and Wu escaped through the back door. They chased her to the street and beat her. The tea room guests in the apartment all witnessed it." At this point, the court stated that since the witness Xi Jinping and the defendant Chen Rong had not arrived, the hearing was adjourned until the afternoon of the 12th for further summons of witnesses and ordered the plaintiff to summon Chen Rong to court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Since the water level of the Yangtze River has fallen sharply, the Haizhou salt that is shipped to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been blocked. Some Haizhou ships in the upper reaches have been stranded for months, and they have only recently been able to unload. Although the freight cost of transporting salt has increased by one time, the shipping companies still dare not risk taking on the shipments, fearing that they will be stranded midway and unable to load or unload, resulting in huge losses, which would be a real loss. Therefore, for the past month, the amount of Haizhou salt accumulated for shipment has increased daily, and the salt merchants are anxious to ship it. Recently, due to the gradual increase in the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, to two feet and four inches, the river ships can pass to and fro. The salt merchants are planning to transport Chen Jia.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Accountant of Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory Embezzles Large Sums of Money, Speculation Fails; Fears Punishment and Commits Suicide by Poisoning; Three Brokers Also Involved and Arrested; Deposit Guarantee in the Exchange Seized <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bingrong from Jiaxing, the accountant of Qiming Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 260 Edward Road, who is 24 years old, recently colluded with brokers Xu Yixiang (22 years old) from Songjiang, apprentice Huang Bozheng (20 years old) from Ningbo, and Wu Hongda (21 years old) from Wenzhou, and others, and used public funds from the factory to engage in yarn and flower speculation. They also frequented prostitutes and gambled, and contracted venereal diseases. Recently, the price of yarn and flowers has fluctuated greatly, so Chen and others have lost tens of thousands of yuan. On the 1st of this month, the manager, Zhu Wen, suddenly investigated the accounts and immediately discovered that there was a shortage of 5,000 yuan. After detailed investigation, it was found that it was not 5,000 yuan, but more than 40,000 yuan, so he investigated it. Chen confessed that it was caused by the failure of speculation with Wu Yixiang and others. Fearing that the manager would sue the officials, he secretly swallowed a bottle of potion and committed suicide. After being discovered, he was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. Because he was determined to die, he could not be saved and died at 4:00 pm. The hospital telegraphed the General Patrol Room, and the Chinese detectives Zhang Mingde, Jiang Shangpei, and Bao Tan Zhou Zhenxing rushed to the scene and took Chen to the Fielun Road Coroner's Office. On the 2nd, the prosecutor of the First Special Court verified the body, ordered it to be coffined and buried. The detectives then found out this embezzlement case, so they went to the Qiming Factory the day before yesterday and arrested the three people, Xu, Huang, and Wu. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The patrol room lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the previous situation, because the accounts were numerous and the investigation was time-consuming, so he requested permission to be detained for investigation. He also said that the current defendants' guarantee deposit in the exchange reached more than 10,000 yuan, and the patrol room has been notified to seize it, etc. Judge Feng Shide reviewed and reported it, and then ordered Xu and others to be detained for one week for further interrogation. The salt was loaded on the pier, and the Zhonghe ship (2,030 tons) of the Shanghai Huatong Shipping Company, with a draft of 18 feet, was rented to load salt. Yesterday, it opened to Chenjiagang and sailed into the Twelve Forts port. The highest tide there is only 13 feet, so the Zhonghe ship was immediately stranded in the port and could not move. Yesterday, the shipowner telegraphed Shanghai to report. A ship has now been sent to tow it for rescue. In fact, it is still impossible to ship Haizhou salt to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>

More than 350 workers from the east factory of Yizhong Fuji Porcelain Electric Company in Lingjiaqiao, Yangjing Town, Pudong, also changed their treatment rules by the factory. All the preferential treatment methods in the past were cancelled. The labor union has repeatedly asked the factory to maintain the original treatment, but without result.

<h3 id="e134">Xin Xin Employee Ma Youcai Sues Wife for Adultery; Receives a Letter and Uses it as Evidence <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Ma Youcai from Chuansha, 34 years old, has been working in the tobacco department of Xin Xin Company on Nanjing Road for 11 years. He married Ma Gu, 24 years old, who lives in Majiazhaizi in his hometown. Ma Sunxi, 32 years old, also lives in the same house and works as a broker in the Yuanshun Timber Firm of Xuejia Hong in Nanshi, Shanghai. However, Ma Youcai does not often return home. Unexpectedly, in July of this year, Ma Youcai suddenly received a letter from Ma Sunshi, the wife of Ma Sunxi, stating that her husband Ma Sunxi had committed adultery with Ma Youcai's wife Ma Gu. After receiving the letter, Ma Youcai believed that the letter from the wife of the adulterer was credible. He returned to his hometown to investigate and was also told by his fellow villager, Xi Daosheng, that he had seen Ma Sunxi and Ma Gu sleeping together in the Sutai Hotel in April. Ma then sued the local court based on this information, and the prosecutor immediately filed a public prosecution against Ma Sunxi and Ma Gu based on the letter and Xi Daosheng's testimony. Yesterday, Judge Xie Zheng opened a court session to hear the case. Ma Youcai testified about the previous situation. Ma Gu testified that she married Ma Youcai when she was 19 years old, and their relationship was not good. He only returned to his hometown once or twice a year. Her husband disliked her for being ugly, so he colluded with Xi Daosheng to give false testimony to harm her and wanted to sell her. She did not know Ma Sunxi very well. However, her husband had married three wives, and he said that a wife was a dish that he wanted to change the taste of, so he framed her, meaning that he was tired of eating small dishes and wanted to change the taste, so she asked for justice. At this point, Ma Sunxi testified that the plaintiff lived in Dongcun, and he lived in Xicun. They did not communicate, nor did he commit adultery with Gu. Opening a room in the Sutai Hotel was because he and his wife went to his uncle's house, so he stayed with his wife in the clan hall. How could he call a stag a horse? His relationship with his wife was very good, and she was illiterate, so how could she write a letter? His wife could testify to this. At this point, Ma Sunshi was summoned and testified that she was 34 years old, and Ma Sunxi was her husband. Their relationship was very good. She had never written a letter. Xi Daosheng wrote it in her name. Mr. Gao saw him write it. As for going to the Sutai Hotel, she stayed with her husband, etc. After the court verified the confession, the case was found to be bizarre and ordered to be investigated, and Xi Daosheng was summoned to court for questioning, and then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>Citizens in Caoyang Road and Tanjiawan and other places in northwest Shanghai jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the installation of water pipes to improve hygiene. The original petition is as follows: "Petition for Rivers that are Dirty and Difficult to Provide Drinking Water; Requesting the Public Works Bureau to Order the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to Expedite the Laying of Water Pipes, Opening the Water Supply to Respect Life and Show Fairness." The western Shanghai Caoyang Road Tanjiawan Guangfu Road area under its jurisdiction is full of factories and densely populated. Since the construction of bridges and roads, transportation has been convenient, and the population has increased day by day. The financial bureau's donations have been collected, but the sanitary facilities have not been taken care of. Compared with other places, it is like heaven and earth. Although it is under the jurisdiction of the government, rights and obligations are naturally treated equally. The most difficult point here is the lack of clean drinking water, and tap water is necessary for daily use by residents, and fire officials are urgent for routine matters. It has sent a letter to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company urging it to find a way to connect it, often citing the reason that the project is large and the money is huge. This summer, in this area, many people died from drinking unclean river water. It is chilling to talk about it. It is heard that the Water and Electricity Company has a surplus every year, and the expansion of water pipes is also beneficial to the company, and the lives of citizens are at stake, and the obligations are not exhausted, and there is no guarantee of life. He dared to express his feelings and jointly asked the government to approve the request, and ordered the Public Works Bureau to order the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to quickly install water pipes to benefit life and show fairness. It is true virtue."</p>

<p>Since the strict prohibition of gambling by the Chinese Concession police authorities, a group of gambling rogues reliant on gambling for a living such as Blind Xin Gen, Lao San, and Xiao Jinsheng, came up with an outlandish idea to set up secret floating gambling dens on ships at the Yuanfang Road Yihua Pier in Hongkou. They secretly gathered for gambling, offering games such as dice, Twenty-Six Doors, and Big Small Pai Gow. Gambling hours were from 1:00 PM to 12:00 AM daily, with significant amounts of money changing hands. Despite repeated raids by the water patrol and Hongkou police, who arrested the owners and gamblers and handed them over to the local court for sentencing, these gamblers did not learn their lesson and continued to gamble in secret. However, their scheme was discovered by the Hongkou police, who dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to raid the den yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM. The gamblers were in the midst of betting loudly, in high spirits, when they suddenly saw the detectives arrive, and they scattered in panic, causing great disorder. More than forty people, including the owners and gamblers, were arrested on the spot, along with gambling paraphernalia such as dice, dice cups, and over two hundred yuan in gambling funds. They were all taken to the police station for detention and will be escorted to the Special District Court this morning for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Detective Yin Bengen Assassination Case Cracked, Sun Er Guniang is Key Witness, Main Suspect Wang Dianhua Confesses to Murder <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yin Bengen, a native of Hefei, was thirty-nine years old this year. He served as a detective. On the night of October 11th of this year, at 11:00 PM, in front of the house of local woman Shao Wangshi at No. 168 Qianjiatang Wu Jia Nong, Huanlong Road in the French Concession, he was suddenly chased down by two men and shot to death. Afterwards, the French police ordered the arrest of the murderers. Recently, a Russian, Li Yaming Qiao Zhi Qixi Li Aiqu (transliteration), was shot to death in front of No. 1246 Route Lafayette at 12:30 PM on the 1st of this month. The murderer fled the scene, and the police took the body to the morgue and reported it to the Second Special District Court for examination. The body was claimed by relatives for burial. It has been learned that the bullets recovered by the French police from the Russian's body were the same as those recovered from Yin Bengen's body, suggesting that they were killed by the same gang of bandits. An order was issued to all Chinese and Western detectives under their command to tighten the search for the murderers. Under the investigation of Inspector Jin Jiulin, Detectives Zhou Buguang, Zhou Bingcheng, Lin Yilong, and Li Jinzhang, the murderer of the Yin case was finally found. It turned out that the husband of a woman from Anhui, Sun Er Guniang (38 years old this year, residing at No. 8 Chongfu Lane, Route Foch), was arrested and imprisoned by Yin Bengen for theft. Yin then had an affair with Sun Er Guniang. However, Sun Er Guniang became fickle and in recent months became acquainted with Wang Dianhua (also known as Lao Wu, 34 years old), a fellow villager residing at No. 1, Lane 984, Route Petain in the French Concession, leading to Wang and Yin becoming enemies due to jealousy. Moreover, Wang had a friend who was also a thief and was arrested and imprisoned after being reported by a detective. Therefore, Wang hated Yin deeply and planned to have Yin killed to eliminate the harm and vent his anger. Inspector Jin obtained this lead and learned that Wang Dianhua's wife had recently died of illness and the funeral was scheduled for the afternoon of the 2nd. He led the detectives Tao Rongling, Wu Wengang, etc., to the address around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd and arrested Wang Yi Gong Dai Dianhua, Wu Weicai, Sun Er Guniang, Liang Yuguang, Zhao Shilai, Zhong Jizhuo, Ji Yegen, Zhang Chengzhi, Wu Huari, Yang Yuanshu, Liang Houyu, and other eleven men and women. They were taken to the police station. Wang confessed to killing Yin, but the handgun used for the murder could not be retrieved. At noon yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Attorney Gu Shouxi of the Police Department explained the case and requested a two-week adjournment to investigate the details of the case before filing for trial. Detective Tao Ronglin then reported the process of arresting the defendants. When Wang Dianhua was interrogated, he confessed that he, Wang Kaifu, who was at large, and Ma Changshou killed Yin. Because Yin had an affair with Wang Kaifu's sister, Wang Kaifu called me to go. We took two handguns and fired five shots. I was on the side and did not hold a handgun. Wu Weicai confessed that he did not go at the time but knew about the killing of Yin Bengen afterwards. Sun Er Guniang confessed that she had an affair with Yin Bengen and did not know Wang Dianhua. The other eight defendants claimed that they went to carry the coffin or attended the funeral of Wang Dianhua's wife and were arrested without knowing anything about the murder. Wang Dianhua also confessed that the handgun belonged to Ma Changshou. Witness Shao Wangshi testified that the deceased (Bengen) ran into my living room that night, and he (referring to Wang Dianhua) chased in with a handgun and told the deceased to come out. The deceased was stubborn, and I told them to go out. He (referring to Wang) scared me with a handgun and forbade me to make a sound. Then a short man dragged the deceased out and shot him to death. Yin Bengen's wife and daughter also came to the court and requested a strict investigation to seek justice. After verification of the confessions by Judge Wang Gangxu, the hearing was adjourned to the 19th, and the defendants were remanded in custody. The investigating detectives were instructed to report to the court for the release of any defendants found to be unrelated to the case.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the news column of your newspaper on December 13, regarding the case of lawyer Fei Guoxi and Wu Zhenjue in a lawsuit involving injury, the content does not align with the facts. Wu Zhenjue and his wife, Zhou, came to our law firm around August of the 19th year of the Republic of China and established a divorce agreement, each holding a copy as proof. Currently, Wu Zhenjue is unemployed and destitute, and our lawyer, feeling pity for his plight, introduced him to a job and provided him with lodging. Recently, in the case of Wu Zhenjue accusing Wang Xiaoshu of adultery and abduction of Zhou, during the court hearing at the Shanghai Local Court, he denied the previous divorce case, claiming that our lawyer had forged it. Lawyer Fei refuted his accusations and requested the newspaper to make a correction. Wu Zhenjue then harbored a grudge and falsely accused him of causing injury to the police station. As this concerns reputation, please take the trouble to make a correction to avoid misinformation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Fei Guoxi</p>

<h3 id="e150">Overview of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Changes in September of the 25th Year <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview, No. 39)</p>
<p>The state of industry and commerce in Shanghai this month outwardly exhibits a striking appearance of prosperity. The 52 newly established firms are the highest monthly record this year. Closures were only one more than the previous month, maintaining the downward trend since June. However, a closer look reveals that this abnormal prosperity is due to the recent emergence of a large number of so-called "escort agencies." The continued sluggishness of the manufacturing industry and the gradual decline of the retail sector remain significant obstacles to the city's prosperity. Nevertheless, compared with the same period last year, the actual number of industrial and commercial households in Shanghai this year is much better than last year. A total of 52 new establishments, 13 expansions, 3 contractions, 210 reorganizations, and 59 closures were recorded this month. Compared to the past two months and the same period last year, the figures are as follows:</p>
<p>New Establishment  Expansion  Contraction  Reorganization  Closure</p>
<p>July, 25th Year     34           20          22           130           71</p>
<p>August             27           16          9            235           58</p>
<p>September          52           13          3            210           59</p>
<p>September, 24th Year     25           —           —            221           84</p>
<p>The number of new establishments this month increased by 25 compared to the previous month and 27 compared to the same period last year. Expansions decreased by 3 compared to the previous month. Contractions decreased by 6 compared to the previous month. Reorganizations decreased by 25 compared to the previous month and 11 compared to the same period last year. Closures increased by 1 compared to the previous month and decreased by 25 compared to the same period last year. The distribution of these figures among various industries this month is as follows:</p>
<p>New Establishment  Expansion  Contraction  Reorganization  Closure</p>
<p>Special Industries      29           5           1            67           13</p>
<p>Manufacturing Industry  7            2           1            33           10</p>
<p>Retail Commerce         16           6           1            110          36</p>
<p>Total                 52           13          3            210          59</p>
<p>The number of new establishments in the special industries category increased by 20 compared to the previous month, and closures decreased by 18 compared to the previous month, a rare phenomenon. The reason is the successive appearance of escort agencies, as mentioned earlier. Due to the sluggish market and the depression in various industries, the former "escort houses" have mostly transformed into dance halls for those with greater financial resources, while those with weaker funds have changed their names and identities, all calling themselves "escorts." The financial industry in the special industries category was relatively quiet this month. The more important changes in other industries include the following:</p>
<p>(1) The Six Nations Hotel Ceases Operation and Liquidates. This hotel was originally formed from the reorganization of the former Quan Jia Fu Western Restaurant and the Continental Hotel. It only opened for business in July of this year. Manager Gu Yuanlong and Assistant Manager Li Yongqing were appointed. At the time of opening, the business was affected by the sluggish market and was not prosperous. Eventually, internal staff carried out dishonest acts, and shareholders had differing opinions. Assistant Manager Li even took all the account books, vouchers, and cash and left, making it impossible to operate. The hotel was forced to announce the cessation of business and liquidation.</p>
<p>(2) Jinlan Xieji Food Company's Liquidation Call. This company was formerly known as the Jinlan Hotel Food Company, which was quite large in scale and could be called one of the giants in the Cantonese industry. It has been in business for more than two years since its opening. Initially, the business was booming and its reputation was growing. However, due to the recent decline in the market, the business plummeted. It was later transferred and reorganized into the Jinlan Xieji Food Company at the end of March of this year, but the market remained sluggish, and the business did not improve. As a result, the loss was significant. It was extended to the 10th of this month, and finally, due to the inability to maintain operations, the liquidation call was announced. It is said that the debts owed can be offset against each other. (To be continued)</p>

<p>A Guide to Understanding Gonorrhea</p>
<h3 id="e151">What to Do After Contracting Gonorrhea <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of Tokyo Imperial University Medical School</p>
<p>...Before gonorrhea is completely cured, one must not have contact with the opposite sex. This is a matter of morality to be observed...During the treatment period, one must adhere to a consistent treatment method to eradicate the roots of gonorrhea and achieve a full cure.</p>
<p>The more developed a city becomes, the more people suffer from venereal diseases. Therefore, venereal diseases are more prevalent in cities than in towns, and more prevalent in towns than in villages. This is because the cost of living is higher in cities, and it is not as easy to marry as in the countryside. On the other hand, due to the prosperity of prostitution, various disguised entertainment venues emerge one after another, and the prevalence of venereal diseases is inevitable.</p>
<p>Among venereal diseases, syphilis has become very easy to solve due to the invention of the 606 specific medicine. In addition, soft chancres are also not a problem due to proper treatment. Only gonorrhea has always been considered difficult to treat by the medical community. This is because there is no specific medicine. For example, the yellow pigment therapy that was once popular has long since disappeared. According to research by many scholars, the material of yellow pigment is not pure, and side effects cannot be avoided unless it is combined with proteal.</p>
<p>Since gonorrhea is so difficult to treat, what should be done after contracting gonorrhea? During the acute phase, pus flows from the urethra, the glans penis swells and aches, the foreskin swells upwards, and urination is difficult, often causing patients to cry out in pain. If mistreated at this time, it will become chronic, causing inflammation of the testicles (swelling of the scrotum), inflammation of the prostate, and inflammation of the bladder. Unfortunately, if it is transmitted to one's wife, it will cause her to suffer from leucorrhea and uterine erosion, leading to the inability of both sexes to conceive. Moreover, long-term gonorrhea often causes arthritis and paralysis of the limbs. If complicated by gonococcal endocarditis, one's life is in imminent danger.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the 20th century is a scientific century, and many diseases that were previously considered difficult to treat have now found solutions through science. For example, the preparation of proteal combined with yellow pigment for the treatment of gonorrhea is truly the greatest achievement of modern science! This preparation is "Kelinnong" first created by Dr. Bide. Because the yellow pigment contained in this medicine is combined with proteal, it has no side effects and has a special effect of reducing inflammation and relieving pain, which is unmatched by any yellow pigment preparation. Therefore, regardless of whether gonorrhea is acute or chronic, male or female, taking this medicine will have a miraculous effect. In particular, the proteal in this medicine has the function of awakening anti-gonococcal antibodies in the blood and increasing white blood cells in the blood to powerfully extinguish gonococci, so gonorrhea sufferers who take it are guaranteed to be cured!</p>
<p>If "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is used externally to wash the urethra at the same time (vaginal leucorrhea in women can be washed), it will be even faster to achieve success.</p>
<p>The number of people who have been cured of gonorrhea by taking "Kelinnong" is simply impossible to count. The words of praise for this medicine found in newspapers in Europe and the United States are everywhere. All combined gonorrhea medicines that do not contain proteal are fake medicines. Be sure to identify the real "Kelinnong" when purchasing to avoid danger after taking it.</p>
<p>Stories of Sexuality</p>
<h3 id="e152">An Hour of Spring Night is Worth a Thousand Pieces of Gold: Preparations for the Wedding Night <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>...Those who masturbate should wake up early...Do not waste your precious night.</p>
<p>The love between the two sexes is based on sexual desire, but this sexual desire must be properly expressed. If the body is not fully developed and the marriage age has not been met, then indulging in sexual behavior will inevitably stop the development of the puberty glands halfway, and the hormone secretion function will be insufficient. As a result, the lower part of the body is in a state of underdevelopment. At the same time, due to the decline in sexual function, the vas deferens and ejaculatory ducts are loose and unstable, and due to sexual neurasthenia, the seminal gate cannot be consolidated, resulting in nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and inability to erect. Nowadays, due to the declining morals of society, many ignorant young people suffer from sexual masturbation. Generally, parents are unaware of their son's hidden illness and force him to marry. When it is the night of their wedding, the time for the union of the two sexes, its preciousness is like what Su Dongpo said, "An hour of spring night is worth a thousand pieces of gold." However, due to the depression of sexual function, they cannot enjoy the pleasure of flying. Therefore, the seeds of a bad influence are often planted on the wedding night, and the omen of divorce is also planted here.</p>
<p>If we solve it from the root, we must first quit the bad habit of masturbation, and at the same time supplement the lost hormones, promote the vigor of sexual function, and make development sound. Since I graduated from the Russian Labor University Medical School, I have been practicing medicine. The most effective internal medicine to supplement hormones is "Butikang," which has the greatest and most lasting effect. I will record an example as follows: Mr. Ding Nairong, who lives on Lafayette Road, has a history of masturbation, underdevelopment, and sexual neurasthenia. He first married Ms. Jin and divorced after only two months. The reason for the divorce was sexual neurasthenia, but they superficially claimed other reasons, but his parents were unaware. As a result, they arranged for him to marry a Miss Xiao. Ding, feeling guilty about his past failures, urgently consulted me and begged for treatment. I then instructed him to take a large amount of "Butikang" to supplement hormones and make the sexual organs stronger. He also took "Naiersi Nocturnal Emission Tablets" at the same time to consolidate the seminal gate. He recovered after a total of six weeks, and the lower part of his body was fully developed. The love between the couple after marriage was very strong, and there was never any quarrel.</p>
<p>Notes from the Medical World</p>
<h3 id="e153">Highly Praised by the European Medical Community: Lymphatic Congestion Therapy for Tuberculosis <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, Graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>The greatest contribution to medicine in fifty years...</p>
<p>The treatment of tuberculosis has drained the efforts of many scholars throughout history, but there is still no definite and proper method. Some focus on increasing the vitality of the lungs, while others focus on increasing the calcification (connective tissue) of the lungs. Those that are considered new and reliable include organ therapy; these are all issues considered quite important by the medical community in recent years! However, opinions are divided, and there is no consensus. They can all only be used as a saying, and they are not truly effective therapies. Therefore, tuberculosis can still be said to have no fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Since Dr. Forlanini invented artificial pneumothorax in 1882, this method of relaxing the affected lung has been established in the treatment field in the newest attitude. As a result, the theories of increasing connective tissue and organ therapy have been completely overthrown, and the theory of "lymphatic congestion" has been widely used by lung disease experts. Today, thoracoplasty and phrenic nerve resection in pulmonary surgery are all invented based on this theory.</p>
<p>This lymphatic congestion therapy is to relax the affected lung, thereby reducing its blood flow and lymphatic flow. The cavity can be reduced, and healing can also be achieved in this way, so the tuberculosis can be quickly cured. This is why the results of pneumothorax in hospitals in various countries have been so effective recently.</p>
<p>There is now an internal "Buhfei Naer" preparation developed based on the lymphatic congestion effect theory, which has the ability to effectively treat tuberculosis after taking it. Patients with tuberculosis who cannot undergo surgery such as pneumothorax can get satisfactory results by taking this medicine. After taking "Buhfei Naer," coughing, chest pain, and excessive phlegm are all gone! And stopping hemoptysis, clearing the tide fever, and increasing appetite are all unique and good effects after taking this medicine. And the nature of the medicine is kingly, without any bad stimulation, and it is very easy to treat yourself. Lung disease doctors in various countries all unanimously praise this lymphatic congestion therapy!</p>
<h3 id="e154">Women Who Have Lost Their Youth <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of Army Medical University</p>
<p>Youth is the golden age of women, but it is easy to pass away. Once youth is gone, the sorrow of women begins. How should we maintain him, save him? This is a problem that women who are prematurely aging urgently need to solve.</p>
<p>Originally, the puberty glands of women are the most important organs of women. To maintain youth, we must naturally restore the health of the puberty glands. Many women have difficulties with menstruation, abdominal distension, stabbing pain, or lower back weight, leucorrhea, and various organs are also caused by menstrual irregularities and neurasthenia because the mechanism of the puberty glands - ovarian function is not healthy. The endocrine work is lazy, and all nutrients are lost. Therefore, the muscles are relaxed and the complexion is withered and yellow.</p>
<p>To save these symptoms, you should first take "Bunü Rong" to correct ovarian function, so that the ovulation function is normal, and menstruation is adjusted. At the same time, the metabolism function can be prosperous. Make muscles delicate, ruddy, graceful and charming, call back youth, and restore everything to normal. Since I graduated from the Army Medical University, I have used "Bunü Rong" to cure a large number of women who are prematurely aging. If you have leucorrhea, you can use "Kaerxuedishi vaginal tablets" externally as a suppository to clear the leucorrhea.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Gonorrhea Left Behind by Inferior Drugs <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Mo Aitang, is 23 years old and lives on Route Pabe. Due to the encouragement of a colleague, he set foot in the brothels and contracted gonorrhea. At that time, a certain doctor treated him. In addition to performing illegal surgery for him, he also introduced a certain proprietary medicine. After taking it for three weeks, the external symptoms had been reduced a lot, but he had vomiting, difficult urination, blood in the urine, and gonorrhea threads like flocculent matter, which had become chronic cystitis. Last year, through the introduction of a friend, Mr. E Nanxi, he came to me for treatment. After examination by scientific methods, it was found that his third vessel was very turbid. This kind of urine was examined under a magnifying microscope, and countless gonococci were seen attached to the gonorrhea threads (see Figure A). He was instructed to take "Kelinnong," which had been researched by Peter of Germany for more than 30 years, while using anti-gonorrhea water to wash the urethra externally. Within four weeks, the urine had become clear. However, after re-examination with a microscope, there were still a few gonorrhea threads in the urine, indicating that it had not been eradicated. He was still instructed to take "Kelinnong" for more than a week, and after re-examination, there was no trace of gonococcus. However, for the sake of caution, a blood test was also performed, and there was still no gonococcal reaction (Figure B is the blood for testing).</p>

<h3 id="e158">The Most Embarrassing Leukorrhea <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Although leukorrhea in women is a very common disease, it is indeed one of the most embarrassing for women. Because the vagina is constantly eroded by secretions, it not only stains clothing, but can also be infected by bacteria, becoming a major problem. Such as uterine bleeding, abdominal distension, and menstrual irregularities, all of which are causes of infertility. Moreover, women with leukorrhea have dark circles around their eyes, which is a fatal blow to beauty. Therefore, we are treating leukorrhea urgently, which is also a fundamental transformation of beauty.</p>
<p>"Carse Snowfield Vaginal Tablets" have the effect of sterilizing, stopping secretions, and preventing decay. They are the most suitable external suppositories for treating leukorrhea and can be treated at home. Whether it has been present for many years or is newly onset, it can be cured in a short period of time. However, for those caused by gonorrhea, "Clinon" can be taken concurrently to eliminate gonococci. For those with menstrual difficulties caused by leukorrhea, "Bu Nü Rong" can be taken concurrently, and the disease will be cured naturally.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines are all prescribed by doctors who have graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. Please be sure to recognize the names of the medicines when purchasing! Do not buy miscellaneous and inferior medicines based on what others say, to avoid the danger of misuse.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and Difficulty Urinating</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ren of Wuchang writes: I was momentarily confused and contracted gonorrhea. It has been two years and five months now, with difficulty urinating and joint pain. After purchasing and taking about five boxes of "Clinon," I saw full effects immediately, and the urine became clear!</p>
<p>Quick Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Yulin asks: I unfortunately contracted gonorrhea at the end of last month and have taken various preparations, but none have been effective. Now my urethra is swollen and painful, with a lot of pus. Urinating is difficult. Please advise on a reliable treatment! Answer: Regardless of whether gonorrhea is acute or chronic, and whether the patient is male or female, "Clinon," a combined preparation of protein and yellow pigment, must be taken internally to clear toxins from the urethra and blood. Once taken, the effects are immediately visible. However, please recognize the words "Clinon" when purchasing to avoid mistakenly purchasing counterfeit medicines. If you can also use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urethra (women can wash the vagina), the effect will be even greater! "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is available at Wing On Company's pharmacy department and Tai Wo Pharmacy.</p>

<p>To discuss the treatment of stomach problems, proper handling is essential. The function of the stomach originates in the muscles and mucous membrane within the stomach. Improper handling will damage the mucous membrane and impair muscle movement, thereby increasing the stomach problem!</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience, only "Qiang Wei Jing" (Strengthening Stomach Essence) is a medicine with a benevolent nature and great and rapid efficacy! It is miraculously effective for vomiting and acid reflux, chest tightness and reduced appetite, post-meal bloating and pain, food stagnation and weak stomach, and constipation associated with acute and chronic stomach problems!</p>

<p>Saving Gonorrheal Seminal Vesiculitis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal seminal vesiculitis is the type of gonorrhea that most easily damages the sexual nerves and leads to weakness. This is because this symptom most easily stimulates the genital area. It is seen in both acute and chronic stages. Regarding the symptoms of chronic seminal vesiculitis, they are various symptoms arising from adjacent organs. These include pain and irritation in the rectum, urethra, and perineum, with radiating pain extending to the legs and back. Disorders of the posterior urethra and accessory reproductive organs can cause bladder irritation, especially bladder spasms. The most common symptom is Spermatorrhoea in patients with chronic seminal vesiculitis; after intercourse, sperm completely disappears within a few days. Also, the ejaculatory duct is often incompletely closed due to inflammation of the seminal vesicles and vas deferens, often resulting in semen leakage during urination or defecation.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Lin Maoyan had a long-standing bad habit of masturbation and later contracted gonorrhea. He continued this bad habit, further damaging his sexual nerves. He suddenly developed seminal vesiculitis, and improper treatment and misuse of inferior medicines led to the deterioration of his condition, presenting with symptoms of spermatorrhea and semen leakage. He experienced irritating pain in the urethra and perineum, and his legs were also affected, making it difficult for him to walk. He was mentally exhausted, his face was sallow, and he frequently complained of headaches and eye pain, on the brink of death. Later, introduced by his classmate Mr. Fang Minzhong, he sought my treatment, as he was indeed experiencing semen leakage due to seminal vesiculitis. Microscopic examination of his semen revealed no traces of sperm, which is a major cause of male infertility. In addition to alternating treatments with long and short radio waves, I instructed him to purchase and take "Clinon" from Tai Wo Pharmacy so that after taking it, his entire body would produce anti-gonorrhea toxins within a short period, thoroughly eradicating the gonococci scattered in the seminal vesicles and vas deferens. "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Supplement) was then used to regenerate sexual tissues, restoring them to a complete state. Within five weeks, his gonorrhea was completely cured. His seminal vesicle leakage was also corrected by the restorative effects of "Bu Ti Kang," promoting the regeneration of new sperm cells. Sperm regeneration was observed after three weeks. Therefore, Mr. Lin got married in the eighth month after his recovery and had a son one year after marriage.</p>

<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>In every country around the world, there are tales of heroes and beauties passed down. It seems that heroes love beauties, and the companions of beauties are invariably heroes!</p>
<p>In fact, beauties do not need to be beautiful, and heroes are not necessarily warriors on the battlefield. As long as one has a strong physique and heroic posture, that person will likely be admired by women.</p>
<p>The reason why athletes are so ardently pursued by women lies in the satisfaction they provide in the realm of sex. Thus, the song "Marry a Warrior" is truly a resonance in the hearts of every woman.</p>
<p>When a man loses his robust physical strength, he also loses the instinct to command his wife. This weakening of instinct is the formation of neurasthenia. Such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erectile strength, numbness of pleasure, and even impotence. The root causes are all due to excessive masturbation during the youth's puberty, induced by bad friends or pornographic books, or due to excessive indulgence in sex after marriage, which damages the sexual organs. For the treatment of sexual neurasthenia, there is no better method than taking the hormone preparation "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Supplement). This is because "Bu Ti Kang" is made from the testicles, sperm, and youth glands of vigorous animals such as gorillas, lions, tigers, and sea dogs, and other precious hormones. It can strengthen the nerves and is particularly effective for impotence, premature ejaculation, infertility, small genitalia, and neurasthenia, insomnia, headaches, dull thinking, and sharp memory loss caused by masturbation and nocturnal emission. It surpasses all similar organ preparations! For nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea, taking "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills" concurrently will be even more effective!</p>

<p>The annual Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football tournament is scheduled to be held in Hong Kong this year. Hong Kong has formally invited the Shanghai team to travel south, with the date set for February 11th to 15th next year (i.e., Lunar New Year's Day).

<h3 id="e163">Last Night, the Western Youth Basketball Team Overcame the Hornets After a Bitter Fight, Resulting in a Score of 36 to 33 <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Hornets team had recently fought fiercely against Xintong, losing by only two points. Last night, the team once again posed a serious threat to Jinan with its fierce resistance, and the Hornets lost by only three points, with the score being 33 to 36. The team's strength should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the Western Youth Basketball League is chaotic, with unequal workloads and rest. In addition to last night's game between the Hornets and Jinan, the original schedule was Fudan against Nanyang, but Nanyang did not appear. It is said that Nanyang was mistaken for Nanching, but Nanching also did not appear, resulting in a bye. Tonight's two games are scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>Shaguier vs. Mingqiang (Junior) 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Qingguang vs. Mai Ling Yi (Independent) 9:00 PM</p>
<p>Yesterday's independent group game between the Hornets and Jinan was particularly exciting. Given the thrilling nature of the Hornets' game against Xintong the day before, Jinan took extra precautions, fielding their formal lineup without making any substitutions midway. The Hornets played seriously and never sloppily, taking an early lead of 11 to 7. Jinan resisted carefully, striving to advance, with the score at 22 to 14 in the first half. In the second half, the situation became even more intense. The Hornets fought hard, causing confusion in Jinan's lineup, resulting in many missed shots and free throws. At one point, the score was 28 to 25. Although the Hornets were three points behind, they seemed to have a good chance of coming from behind. Both teams struggled, making the game even more tense. Finally, the score reached 34 to 31 with 45 seconds remaining. The Hornets planned to take a long shot to try to win, but inadvertently neglected their defense, allowing Han Zhenyuan to score a goal. In the next few seconds, Dong Xiaopei made a long shot, succeeding, but the time had already run out, and Jinan won 36 to 33. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan</p>
<p>Hornets</p>
<p>First Half: Jinan 21 Hornets 14</p>
<p>Second Half: Jinan 14 Hornets 19</p>

<p>The Shanghai Amateur Billiards Team League's game between the Central Youth and Western Youth has not yet ended, but in terms of winning and losing, the Central Youth has already gained a winning score of over 534, securing the victory. Tonight's match at 6:00 PM between Bao Qiyun and English Utt is merely a formality to finish the schedule.</p>
<p>Among the three most noteworthy teams in this league, besides the Central Youth, are the Portuguese and the International Sports Association. The latter two teams are currently competing, with alternating wins and losses. The final key will depend on the efforts of both sides' main players today.</p>
<p>The skills and experience of these two teams' main players have reached divine levels. One is Zhang Yingda, and the other is Medina. The game will start at 6:00 PM at the International Sports Association, with a total of 300 points to be scored. Billiards enthusiasts should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Datong University Held a Basketball Game Yesterday to Support Suiyuan: John Lost to Datong; East Asia Beat Chongde; Five Dragons Defeated Xin Team <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Datong University specially invited famous basketball teams from Shanghai to hold an exhibition game at the school last night to raise funds to support the soldiers in Suiyuan fighting against the enemy. There were a total of three games starting at 6:30 PM. As a result, (1) Datong defeated John 31 to 27, (2) the East Asia women's team defeated Chongde 25 to 21, and (3) Five Dragons defeated the Xin team 51 to 20. There were six to seven hundred spectators, and the ticket revenue was probably four to five hundred yuan. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The game was kicked off by Cao Huiqun, the president of Datong University. After the game, the game ball was auctioned off and purchased by Zhu Tingqi, the director of the Shanghai Salt Affairs Inspection Office, for fifty yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Datong Defeated John</p>
<p>The first game was between Datong and John. Datong played well in the first half, taking the lead with a score of 20 to 13. John tried to counterattack in the second half, scoring repeatedly. Datong also did not show weakness. In the end, Datong defeated John 31 to 27.</p>
<p>East Asia Defeated Chongde</p>
<p>The second game was between the East Asia and Chongde women's teams. Chongde was very active in the first half, and East Asia struggled to resist, with Chongde taking the lead 13 to 6. However, East Asia worked hard in the second half, and Jiao Yulian and others displayed their prowess. Although Chongde tried to maintain its lead, it was eventually defeated by East Asia 25 to 21.</p>
<p>Five Dragons Defeated the Xin Team</p>
<p>The third game was between Five Dragons and the Xin team. Five Dragons was organized by former famous players from North China and obtained the participation of Li Zhenzhong, making their strength very strong. The Xin team was overshadowed in comparison. The score was 24 to 10 in the first half, and the total result was 51 to 20, with Five Dragons winning by a large margin. In this game, Five Dragons only had five players on the field. Because it was an exhibition game, Wu Bixin continued to participate in the game even after committing four fouls. The scores of both sides are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Iron City Cup Basketball Tournament Opened Yesterday: The Municipal Sports Basketball Team Made a Stunning Debut; Last Year's Champion, Xiangyin, Was Overwhelmed <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The second Iron City Cup Basketball Tournament, co-organized by the Municipal Sports Field and the Municipal Sports Association, opened yesterday with four games. The game between Sheguang and Qimei was one-sided and uninteresting. The games between Municipal Sports B and Zhiying, and Yaoguang and Erqi were equally matched and more competitive. Municipal Sports B and Yaoguang both won by a difference of two points. The last game between Municipal Sports A and Xiangyin was quite exciting. Xiangyin was last year's champion and hoped to win two consecutive championships to win the silver cup, so everyone fought hard. However, although Municipal Sports A was a newly formed team, it made a stunning debut, overwhelming Xiangyin with a score of 45 to 28. The situation for this year's championship has changed. The team members are strong, agile, and have evenly distributed talent. Right forward Wu Zhenxia's performance was particularly brilliant, scoring 26 points alone, attracting the attention of more than 500 spectators. Today there were originally four games, but the game between Chongde and Liangjiangxiong was postponed to Saturday from 8 to 9 due to an incident. The game between Southeast and Liangjiangying, originally scheduled for Saturday from 8 to 9, has been postponed due to Liangjiang's expedition to Hankou. The results of yesterday's games and today's schedule are recorded below:</p>

<p>The Donghua Reserve Team played a friendly match with the Hujiang University football team yesterday afternoon at the school's field in Yangshupu to actively prepare for the upcoming battle with the strong team Lao Yier next week. Dai Linjing and Zhou Guangzhong also participated to help. Due to the wind against them in the first half, Dai Linjing only scored one goal, winning by a narrow margin of 1 to 0. In the second half, Jia Jiliang opened the scoring, Dai Linjing scored again, and Luo Haiguang also added one, Hujiang tried hard to counterattack, but ultimately lost 4 to 0 due to their inferior strength. Donghua won a big victory. As for Mr. Zhou Guangzhong, after arriving in Shanghai last week, he was originally scheduled to participate in the game against French Commerce, but it was not possible due to diarrhea. After participating in yesterday's battle, he returned to Beijing by night train that night and will wait for orders to depart for Xuzhou. If he does not go, he will still come to Shanghai to serve Donghua, but it is still difficult to be sure.</p>

<p>Yesterday the sugar market was stable. The guild set the price for spot goods of No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $21.525, with slight transactions, a slight increase of 2.5%. Re-export goods were at $6.10, without fluctuation. Spot and re-export goods of Dongbai No. 489 maintained their original prices. This factory's fine white sugar, Zhenji, Dahua, and Jinxin No. 1 were all at $20.40. Other prices remained unchanged. For labeled goods, the Guangchao group offered 108 bags of bagged Zhuang red sugar at $14.80; provincial bagged red sugar, 125 bags at $10.90; Beihai sliced green sugar, 220 pieces at $10.30; Huizhou red sugar, 160 bags at $23.90. Although the arrival of new Chao green sugar from the production area has increased, it is still sold as soon as it arrives, so the asking price tends to stabilize again. It seems unlikely to loosen further in the short term.</p>

<p>Hu Shih's "Independent Critic" was suddenly ordered to cease publication late on the second day by the Hebei-Chahar authorities. According to Mr. Hu, he only learned of this after reading the newspaper and does not yet know the details. He will telegraph to Beiping to inquire about the specifics. Mr. Hu expressed deep sorrow and said he would not be able to go north today. His scheduled speech at the YMCA on the afternoon of the third has been canceled. It is difficult to find a suitable venue in Shanghai for the time being, so he will no longer give speeches here. Since its publication, "Independent Critic" has had many readers among the intellectual class because its writers include Mr. Hu himself, as well as Weng Wenhao, Jiang Tingfu, Ren Shuyong, Chen Hengzhe, Xian Yuxiu, Pan Guangdan, Zhou Binglin, and others who are all highly respected figures of their time. The reason for the forced closure is reportedly due to two articles: one written by Binglin on the 8th, and the other by Zhang Xiruo on the 229th. Both articles were allegedly feared by certain parties, leading to the order to cease publication. Currently, the general public here is paying close attention to this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Yarn and Cotton Prices Surge Twenty Yuan in Three Days, Yarn Prices Slightly Rebound Yesterday, Near-Term Three to Four Yuan, Long-Term Estimated at Five Yuan, High Prices Still Seen at Two Hundred Sixty-Two Yuan <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has been soaring continuously, prompting profit-taking and a sudden reaction. There is also a shortage of spot yarn, so some parties with large holdings are not letting go. The momentum is still tired but perky. However, after rising about twenty yuan in the last three days, the market price has stabilized somewhat, and bulls are releasing large quantities, causing market sentiment to decline. This kind of reversal is also expected. In the afternoon, it was rumored that EWO offered 500 bales of 20s Five Rams and Shepherd yarns at a price of 250 yuan including tax.</p>
<p>The Market Began to Decline in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The forward market opened with December contracts rising sharply due to reports of severe labor unrest in Qingdao, causing people to expect higher prices. Retail investors covered their short positions, and the bullish trend intensified, with the peak reaching 260 yuan. When trading in long-term contracts, the momentum was slightly calmer. In the second session, the market retreated due to weak raw cotton prices and large-scale selling by major players. At the same time, the rise in Osaka Sanpin yarn was not strong, and the momentum was weak. As a result, the closing price for this month was 1.4 yuan higher than the previous day, while long-term contracts fell by 1 to 1.5 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, major players sold off, and the Sanpin yarn market also declined, loosening the market. All months fell by 1.9 to 2.4 yuan. The second session rose slightly. By the third closing, rumors circulated that EWO had offered 2,000 bales, leading to increased selling. As a result, all months plummeted by 3.9 to 4.7 yuan from the morning closing price. It was found that 1,900 bales of Jifeng, 1,300 bales of Hengyi, 7,700 bales of Yuda, 1,950 bales of Mingde, 2,850 bales of Daqing, 6,750 bales of Hexing, 1,650 bales of Taixing, 5,350 bales of Renfeng, 4,650 bales of , 1,650 bales of Tonghe, 1,300 bales of Tongfeng, 2,200 bales of Dachangcheng, and 1,800 bales of Runkang were sold. 18,550 bales of Changfeng, 3,550 bales of Tongji, 2,550 bales of Deda, 1,250 bales of Minghua, 1,300 bales of Xingchang, 1,500 bales of Senkang, 1,500 bales of Hengde, 2,000 bales of Shengyuan, 1,800 bales of Jinkang, 1,100 bales of Zhenda, and 1,200 bales of Wangtaixing were bought. The price comparison for the day is as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Still Good</p>
<p>It was found that all groups bought a total of 1,020 bales throughout the day, and the selling price was similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market is quite soft due to the renewed labor unrest in Qingdao, which has hit it hard. In addition, the arrival of goods from all directions is surging, leading to weak sentiment. Many people are willing to sell when prices rise. However, overseas Indian and American cotton markets are turning upwards, and the current demand from factories is still quite strong.</p>
<p>Affected by the Qingdao Labor Unrest</p>
<p>The forward cotton market opened with very stable momentum. Due to the surge in goods arriving from all directions, there is no shortage of people willing to sell when prices rise. Therefore, although American cotton is rising, the market is being suppressed and it is still difficult to turn around. As a result, the closing prices for all months fell by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was calm when it opened in the afternoon. Many people said that the labor unrest in Qingdao was severe, and the selling pressure was even stronger. The market gradually declined. As a result, all months fell by 0.15 to 0.23 yuan compared to the morning closing. It was found that 13,900 dan of Runkang, 17,900 dan of Changhe, 3,300 dan of Wangtaixing, 3,500 dan of Mingde, 1,600 dan of Jifeng, 5,000 dan of Deda, 3,200 dan of Taixing, 2,500 dan of Senkang, 1,300 dan of Fengtai, and 1,100 dan of Dafeng were sold. 9,400 dan of Yuda, 4,700 dan of Zhenda, 2,000 dan of Yuan Yi, 5,300 dan of Taichang, 9,400 dan of Yichang, 11,100 dan of Changfeng, 2,300 dan of Shengyuan, 1,200 dan of Jinkang, 6,100 dan of Renfeng, and 4,100 dan of Dachangcheng were bought. The price comparison for the day is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e182">Three Major Reasons for the Surge in the Yarn Market, Reaching a New High Since the Eighth Year of the Republic, The Margin for This Month's Futures Increased to Thirty-Four Yuan <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The situation in the yarn and cloth market has suddenly developed rapidly. During this period, the price of December yarn rose from more than 230 yuan to 60 yuan, breaking through four major levels in succession. New peaks have emerged one after another. Yesterday, a new high price of 262 yuan was seen, which is the highest peak since the eighth year of the Republic. There are three reasons for this: First, our country has had a bumper harvest in both spring and autumn. Farmers have been in dire straits for five years, and their economies have been able to recover slightly. The market for cloth has been the first to become active. Second, yarn factories have suffered five years of adversity, and raw cotton has been expensive and yarn cheap for many years. Yarn factories have almost been in a state of bankruptcy. In addition, Chen cotton for July and August of this year was sold short, raising the price to 52.5 yuan. The yarn price was still in a state of exhaustion. At that time, the price of near-term futures yarn was 193.1 yuan, and factories were losing money. Some yarn factories were under financial pressure and unable to turn around, so they announced shutdowns and reduced production, resulting in a sharp decrease in production volume and dwindling inventories. Several factories in North China have been purchased by Japanese merchants, which shows the severity of the difficulties faced by yarn factories. Later, in the autumn, because the weather was favorable, with timely rain, cotton and rice had a bumper harvest across the country. Buyers from the south and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River flocked to purchase, so the factories had no large quantities of spot yarn to supply. First, they purchased 30,000 bales of yarn from their warehouses, and then they expected the price of futures yarn to rise. Third, because the trend of government bond margins was bleak, general speculators changed direction and shifted their focus, flocking to the cotton and yarn market. As a result, the number of trading chips increased sharply. The trading volume for the four-month period has accumulated to a huge 1,054,150 bales. As trading increased, the fluctuations became even greater. The market closes late every day. General speculators are following the trend, and the rises and falls are difficult to predict. In order to avoid danger, the exchange authorities have increased the special margin for December futures yarn by three batches, totaling 24 yuan. Including the original margin of 10 yuan per bale, the total is 34 yuan. The remaining months have been increased by two batches per bale, totaling 16 yuan. Including the original margin of 10 yuan, the total is 26 yuan. The current price of 20s Jincheng yarn, including tax, has reached 276 yuan, and 42s Jincheng has reached 405 yuan. In fact, the yarn industry has been in decline for five years, and it seems that the good times are coming.</p>
<h3 id="e183">American Cotton Sentiment is Extremely Excited, Short Selling is Gradually Decreasing, Spot Goods are Strong <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the prices of all months fell by 2 points, but rose by 4 points. In the early morning, traders bought December contracts. The Liverpool market was active, and new customers from outside the industry were buying, causing prices to rise firmly. Sentiment is very excited because short selling is gradually decreasing and spot goods are strong, and the prices of all goods are rising. Then, due to profit-taking by bulls, there was a partial reaction. There was considerable discussion about the government's sale of loan cotton, but there was no official announcement from the government. The market closed firm. Spot goods rose by 5 points, futures rose by 5 to 9 points, English cotton spot goods rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 96 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants, but then fell back due to the decline in Japanese yarn and the rush of cotton farmers to sell. In the end, it rose again due to the strength of the stock market and short covering. Pingguoer rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 2 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd telegram).</p>
<p>Also excerpt from Mumbai telegram, the forecast for the opening on the 3rd is: Bairoxi at 220 rupees, Aomula at 199.25 rupees, and Pingguoer at 161.5 rupees, all up 0.25 rupees.</p>
<p>American Cotton Private Estimates</p>
<p>According to a New York Telegraph report on the 2nd, the estimated output of the new cotton crop this year is 11,934,000 bales, and the amount ginned is 11,386,000 bales.</p>
<p>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton are Still Quiet and Stable</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 3rd, Sanpin futures yarn rose by 7 jiao to fell by 7 jiao, with near-month at 244 yuan and far-month at 218.6 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 4 jiao to fell by 5 fen, with near-month at 67.6 yuan and far-month at 68.3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Piece Goods, Qingdao Yarn Factories Stop Production, Cotton Cloth Sales to the North are Booming, Yuanfang Piece Goods are Also Rising Sharply <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to rise firmly across the board, unaffected by the sharp fall in cotton yarn. After all, with the shutdown of all yarn factories in Qingdao, the supply of goods from Qingdao has been cut off, and the demand from Shandong and Tianjin has been strong. The southwestern, Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guangxi, Yangtze River, and inland groups are still trying their best to purchase. There is a shortage of spot goods on the market, so cloth prices are rising even more sharply. Heavyweight coarse cloth has been purchased in large quantities by northern groups, and inland groups continue to collect large quantities. The price rose by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan (per bolt). Fine cloth and fine twill grey cloth also rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan per bolt. Bleached cloth, colored cloth, line tweed, Zhigong, and serge also rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. There is a great lack of spot goods. The selling price of fine cloth and fine twill has exceeded the highest price on the 17th of last month by more than 0.8 yuan, which is due to the turnaround in the colored cloth market. Although the price of heavyweight coarse cloth has risen by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan recently, it is still about 0.8 yuan lower than that time. Yesterday, there was a surge in goods being loaded onto ships from all directions, especially from the northern Shandong and southern Guangdong and Yunnan groups.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 3,017th auction of Yuanfang foreign goods in this port. Both northern and inland groups were active in the market. The streets were lively and active. The four types of Western silk satin, Yuan velvet, Zhigong wool, and feather silk were displayed. There were no foreign red cloths listed. A total of 72 boxes of 44 brands were sold. There were only three brands of Jinxi satin. Shishihehou rose by 6.75 fen per yard compared to the previous period, Arctic Exploration rose by 3 fen, and Qianlijuma Wubi remained the same. Yuan velvet prices for the three brands were still average. Zhigong wool was similar to the previous period. The price of feather silk rose uniformly across the 37 brands. Shiba Zilai rose by 1.7 yuan, Yanguogong, Haitianrenqiu, and Zhu brands rose by 1.35 yuan, Dingjia, Zuiwu, Wuxing, Andianbao, all rose by more than 1 yuan. Weimiaoweixiao rose by 1.6 yuan. Bozi 21 yuan each rose by 1 yuan. The rest rose by several jiao. Only Donghua Danglian, Chile Tuan Yuan, three brands remained average.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months rose across the board again. The quoted price of foreign wheat rose by 0.1 yuan for Chicago near-term, and down 0.2 yuan for far-term. Canada rose by 0.1 yuan, and Liverpool rose sharply by 23 pence. Therefore, after the opening price, the market atmosphere was unusually turbulent, and the attitude of the bulls was even more intense. Some of the shorts, under these circumstances, had to take advantage of the situation to cover their positions. Therefore, all months rose by 5, 6, and 7 fen compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the price of this month was hovering, initially down 0.2 fen, and then rebounded. The far-term continued to rise by 1.2 fen compared to the morning because buying sentiment was still strong. At present, the market is heavily influenced by foreign conditions, because domestic wheat has reached the end of its strength and no longer dominates the market.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday, the wheat futures market rose sharply again in all months after opening in the morning. Due to the quotation of foreign wheat, the United States and Canada had little change, while Liverpool rose sharply by 23 pence. The international situation is becoming increasingly serious, so the slightly quiet sentiment has been revived. The opening prices for all months rose by 5, 6 fen to 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, because the flour market continued to rise, there were slight purchases from outside the industry, up 2, 3, 4 fen compared to the morning. In the current wheat market, because the standard has risen sharply, the asking prices are also rising step by step, up 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Shandong wheat is quoted at 6.45 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 6.4 yuan, Haizhou wheat at 6.37 yuan, Guangdong wheat at 6.2 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 6.35 yuan, Hankou wheat at 6.15 yuan, Shaoxing wheat at 6.32 yuan, Pinghu wheat at 5.95 yuan, and Wuhu wheat at 6.7 yuan. 1,000 bags were bought by Shen Da, 3,000 bags by Fuxin, and 2,000 bags by Fufeng.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the arrivals of Ke Xian rice were still strong, with more than 10,000 bags arriving from various ports along the Yangtze River. The market had been soft, but the turnover of Ke Xian rice turned strong yesterday, and a few speculators inquired. Spot sales in the streets were also active. The Ke group was mainly from Shantou, and other groups were still difficult to see. However, after the spot sales turned strong, the weak market has been supported. 7,000 bags of Gan rice, 1,000+ bags of Xiang rice, 850 bags of Wen Yong rice, and 200 bags of Jiangbei rice were offered, totaling more than 9,000 bags. 2,000 bags were bought by Shantou, and the rest were taken in by the streets. The market was generally similar to the previous day, and sentiment has been lifted.</p>

<p>In the recent sesame market, although there have been no significant transactions by foreign firms, the market is still firm. Therefore, spot raw sesame is still firm. It is said that the Shaoxing group and the oil extraction market are thriving, and the source of supply is still small. Therefore, the market is thriving. Yesterday, the group bought 224 bags of Yingzhou yellow sesame, 450+ bags of Linhuaiguan yellow sesame, 300+ bags of Daliji yellow sesame. There were also 95 bags of Guandong brand Chengdian snow sesame sold at a price of 11.35 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although pure gold rose in the gold market, the morale of the industry was abnormal, and it had little impact. The market suddenly fell due to the supply from spot dealers, which led to selling. In the early morning, overseas silver markets, both British and American, rose. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo rose by 3 to 3.5 li. Exchange rates opened higher but closed slightly lower. London raw gold rose by 1.5 pence. The central bank's listed prices were announced, and the British and American were flat. The customs gold unit rose by 3 li. The standard margin price was listed at 1152.3 yuan. Yuan Maoyong made slight gains. The market opened slightly higher in the morning, but after the opening, the market fell as multiple parties united to sell. HSBC's listed prices were announced, and the British and American were flat and declining. Buyers began to maintain the price, and it stabilized slightly. The silver balancing tax was announced to have risen by 1 fen. At this time, the overall situation was stable. Later, the market temporarily declined as spot dealers sold slightly and speculators showed their power. After the decline, the shorts slightly covered their positions.

<p>Yesterday, the government bond market in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange turned into a consolidation pattern, and the market was very stable. The environment was chaotic and depressing, and the market was even more bland. The long and short sides were holding each other back and were both taking a wait-and-see approach. Some large investors have gradually sold off, so the market price has declined slightly, but the transaction volume has not increased, so it is difficult to say that it is a consolidation. Yesterday's opening in the morning was dull, and large investors such as No. 5 and 34 sold a lot, while retail investors bought more. Nos. 35 and 50 also made purchases, and the market price fell uniformly by 5 fen to 3 jiao. In the second session, the market situation was still weak. No. 10 of Wu Ding sold a lot, and Nos. 45 and 5 also sold off. However, Nos. 54 and 3 bought more strongly, and Tong Wu Yi, etc. continued to decrease by 5 fen to 4 jiao. A grade for this month was exceptionally good, rising 5 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, there was a lot of buying to cover short positions, and the trend turned to rebound. Nos. 10 and 54 bought some, and Nos. 13 and 31 continued to sell more. Except for Wu Jia falling another 5 fen and 1.5 jiao this month, all other prices rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The closing market was quite chaotic. Nos. 50 and 5 sold very strongly, but retail investors and Nos. 35 and 10 continued to buy, so the market price only rose or fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao. The overall result for the day was a uniform fall of 1.5 jiao to 4 jiao. The total transaction volume was 5,545,000 yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall, high and low, is listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e191">Silk and Tea, Silk Prices Differ by About 20 Yuan Domestically and Internationally, Indian Merchants and Foreign Firms are Still Inquiring, Silk Mills Only Purchase Sparingly <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market was still weak. New York daily silk with a fineness of 83 and 75 each fell by another cent. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk fell by 5 fen. The selling price of standard silk, near and far periods, fell slightly by half a cent. Lyon still maintained its original price, Hamburg spot goods fell by 3 yuan, and futures rebounded by 8 yuan. In Shanghai, the sales of mouth silk from American and French firms were sluggish. The domestic and foreign silk prices differed by about 20 yuan, so it was temporarily suspended. Fortunately, Indian firms and foreign firms are inquiring diligently. There was considerable activity in the trading of Zhi Li silk in the morning and afternoon. The price opened at the original price, and it may continue to trend in a better direction. Users of the silk market are currently bearish. General silk mills only make sporadic purchases due to urgent needs. Whole batch transactions are still pending. Because the sales of silk are not good, they are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards high-priced raw silk products at present. Therefore, the market for users' silk has returned to a small 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Ocean, Mountains, and Desert <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Louis Auchincloss, at the beginning of his Mediterranean cruise journal, said: "Finally, I left behind the life on land, all the bustling affairs, the noisy clamor. Although it has only been a quarter of an hour since boarding the ship, and the ship is just a floating hotel, it is still surprising how the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose could endure life on land for so long before." The ocean certainly possesses great, profound, changeable, and adventurous allure, but for those who go to sea, the number attracted by the ocean's charm is probably no more than those compelled by the magic of the land. Nowadays, the ocean is a thoroughfare for gold-plated people, but we haven't heard of any gold-plated person loving the sea. The sea is not something loved by those seeking a golden kingdom, and it is almost an obstacle. But those who love the sea do not want to reach a golden kingdom through it; instead, they hope for a ghost ship that will "float forever on the sea without relying on a port," allowing them to leave the land forever. If forced to reach land, they might only hope for an unknown country. In the past, our world was vast, and seafarers could often find new lands. Although new lands quickly fell under the influence of the old world, there was still freer breathing in the new lands. Rebellious and oppressed people were constantly willing to go overseas. North America was ultimately created into a country by some rebels. The Chinese in Southeast Asia could have played out a similar story, but perhaps because they did not need constant struggle after arriving in the new land, they gradually restored the so-called peaceful virtues of the Chinese, and bowed their heads under the sudden intrusion of Western powers. After that, only the empty name of the Chinese Sea remained, and in reality, we lost the ocean. Although in recent years those places have still been the destination for some people forced to go to sea, these are only small corners of the world, no longer the destinations hoped for by seafarers. We think we know the whole world, but the world is actually too small, at least made small by a part of humanity living on it. In fact, since there cannot be a ghost ship that never relies on a port, and there is no way to choose a more ideal port, everywhere is the same land, a point that cannot be temporarily forgotten even on a ship. Naturally, the dreams of sea lovers become even emptier dreams. However, by keeping this dream, we may one day restore the lovable ocean.</p>
<p>Besides the sea, mountains are another beautiful creation of nature. In China, it seems that people generally love mountains more than the sea. Mountains are originally solemn, profound, and ruggedly lovely, but what the Chinese love does not seem to be these qualities. We have so-called mountain and forest literature, but it is merely an attempt to find a novel embellishment in elegance, or at most, a way to express personal grievances. These grievances are often not extreme, perhaps because poets should be gentle and kind, but perhaps also because they fear cutting off the shortcut to officialdom in the Zhongnan Mountains. This is probably also the reason why hermits do not want to go to sea but want to enter the mountains. Going to sea may mean never returning, while entering the mountains has a day of leaving them. Thus, entering the mountains is naturally not too deep. You only need to open the biographies of hermits in historical books to prove it. They create many famous mountains for us, and because of repeated imitation, the fame of these mountains grows, but these famous mountains do not have any majestic or grand meaning. Truly deep mountains and great valleys are only inhabited by rebellious bandits. Just like the starving people and pirates who crossed the sea to foreign lands, no maritime literature is left to us; mountain kings will not leave us any mountain and forest literature either. We do not know much about the famous mountains within the country, even those not in remote areas. As for the "Roof of the World," the highest plateau, and the highest peak far on the borders, we have no way of knowing them until they bear foreign names like Austen and Everest. We cannot understand why people travel thousands of miles, climb those desolate areas full of ice and snow and fraught with danger. We do not understand pioneering, we do not understand tempering, and we do not understand dreaming. We cannot imagine how pleasant it can be in that transcendent, sublime, pure, wonderful realm. If we unfold such a picture before us, it would probably evoke only trembling, not longing. And we confidently believe that we are a great nation, often proudly pointing to our Great Wall as proof, proving that this greatness is locked within the line from Shanhaiguan to Jiayuguan.</p>
<p>Outside the Great Wall is also the desert, and to the west is also the desert. The desert certainly seems completely barren and useless. But that area produces resilient camels, agile steeds, and equally produces brave and solid peoples. The desert has not completely swallowed all life, but instead nurtures a unique vitality. We also call it the "瀚海" (Han Hai, vast sea), and it truly possesses the various qualities of the sea, but also has the hardness and wilderness that the sea lacks. Having floated across the sea and climbed high mountains, without experiencing a desert journey, one cannot be considered to have undergone the most arduous and extraordinary test. We only need to look at history and be amazed that Egyptians, Arabs, Mongols, and Turks all created vast empires. If the theory of the westward migration of the Han people is reliable, then the initial expansion of the Han power may also have benefited from the wild air absorbed from the desert. But once settled, they gradually became peaceful and no longer wanted to endure the tempering of the sand, but only feared and disliked it. Regarding the Xiongnu, the idea that they could come but we could not go was established early on, and the Great Wall is a product of this cowardly idea. Perhaps it once had considerable effect, but this self-made shackle had even greater drawbacks. Some outstanding heroes also tried hard to break the shackles, but soon after being broken, they were repaired again. During the prosperous Tang Dynasty, songs about the hardship of leaving the border satirized ambitious rulers beyond recognition. "Peach blossoms after the horse, snow before the horse, how can one not turn back?" Turn back, turn back, back into the Great Wall, back to Chang'an, back to western Sichuan. By the time the poet expressed the lament, "Liangzhou has fallen for forty years, the Hexi region has been invaded for seven thousand miles. In peaceful times, Anxi was a land of ten thousand miles, but today the border defense is in Fengxiang," it was already too late. After experiencing deeper humiliation, it was realized that "Tang people" was a name to be proud of, and even Genghis Khan's descendants had to be praised sometimes, but few of us understand the desert and want to know the desert. Will the extreme and fierce forever be unrelated to us, and let the desert cultivate the extraordinary spirit of others? The northwest wind is rising; can it bring a little more desert air and arouse our thirst for the desert?</p>
<h3 id="e193">Miscellaneous Notes on Eugene O'Neill's Plays (III) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Readers, I made a request above, "Let me be like a theater critic, like someone who understands drama." Now, I want to withdraw that request and ask you to consider me as someone who completely doesn't understand drama, and what I write is completely the words of an amateur. The essence of drama is close to poetry. My prejudice (perhaps in many cases, it is actually the case) is that scripts with a strong poetic flavor are only suitable for reading, and to a certain extent, are not very suitable for performance. Shelley once said that poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Although this is not an age of poetry, and poets are despised as worthless by merchants with only fat in their bellies, even now, drama still relies on poetry to evoke people's emotions. Many plays by the Irish poet Yeats are full of such characteristics. Another famous and more progressive Irish playwright, such as Sean O'Casey, also permeates the atmosphere of a poet in "Within the Gates" and "The Moon in the Yellow River." Although the moving parts of a drama's performance are not in those poetic dialogues, and the trend of modern drama also tries to avoid using this technique to enhance the important effects of the performance, the exquisite dialogue and the playwright's fondness for using meaningful soliloquies are still commonly used by great modern playwrights. When we read O'Neill's plays, we can often see that the heroes in his plays rarely stop their actions and make long and profound soliloquies, and although those soliloquies are not in poetic form like those of previous playwrights, we still feel a poetic rhythm in his prose soliloquies. For example, in "The Great God Brown," we can read such passionate dialogues:</p>
<p>"Dion: Brown will still need me—to prove he's living! I've loved, lusted, won love, lost love, sung and cried! I'm a lover of life! I once fulfilled her will. If she deserts me now, it's because I'm too cowardly to turn around and dominate her. I'm not good enough to be her creature; you have to create her, or she'll ask you to destroy yourself."</p>
<p>Dion's following soliloquy even more fully reveals such an atmosphere:</p>
<p>"Dion: (With a painful bewilderment) Why am I afraid to dance? I'm a person who loves musical melodies, elegant singing, and laughter! Why am I afraid to live? I'm a person who loves life, the beauty of the flesh, and the lively face of the earth, sky, and sea! Why am I afraid of love? I'm a person who loves love! Why am I afraid? I'm a person who isn't afraid! Why do I pretend to be arrogant to achieve pity? Why must I hide in inferiority to achieve understanding? Why am I so ashamed of my strength and so enamored with my weakness? Why must I live in a cage, like a criminal, resisting and hating, when I'm a person who loves peace and friendship? (Clasps his hands tightly and raises them up in prayer) Oh God, why was I born without skin, so that I could put on armor for contact or being contacted."</p>
<p>In "Welded," we can also see those poetic sentences jumping between the lines:</p>
<p>"Cape: Listen! Sometimes I wake up late at night—alone in a dark world, in the darkness of billions of years. I feel like I want to shout to God for mercy, because life still exists. Then instinctively I look for you—my hand touches you! You are there—beside me—alive—with you I become a whole person, a true person! Life guides me back through billions of years to reach you. That shows me the unity of the beginning, so that I can believe in the unity of the ending." I don't know if there are any actors who can fully perform the meaning of such powerful sentences and deeply penetrate the hearts of the audience. I think poetic soliloquies are very easy to arouse our emotions when we read them, but when they are performed, I feel that those long and serious soliloquies are the most annoying thing for the audience. I remember before January 28, I went with Ling Mo to the Apollo Cinema on North Sichuan Road (now demolished) to see O'Neill's "Anna Christie." In that play, Greta Garbo played Anna, the late old movie queen Marie Dressler played Marthy, and I have completely forgotten who played the two roles of Chris Christopherson and the young sailor "Burke." The motive for going was admiration, but the result was disappointment. I remember that the dialogue between Marthy and Anna took up a large part. Although Dressler and Garbo were both actors who could act, the directors of the Golden State are almost all vulgar and useless fools, who want to use literary masterpieces to call attention, but do not have the means to express them as vividly as possible. As a result, they become neither fish nor fowl, not only failing to please the original author, but also selling out the audience. Furthermore, the latter part of the script was completely cut off by the director. After Anna and her father rescued Burke from the sea, Anna fell in love with him. Old Christopherson saw this situation and cursed "that old devil sea" on the bow of the ship, and the play closed at this point. As for Anna's inner pain because of Burke's love for her in O'Neill's original play, her frankly telling Burke about her past because she didn't want to deceive him, Burke's angrily leaving after hearing everything, Burke's inability to forget Anna and returning to her place again, and old Christopherson's initial opposition followed by his joy at seeing Burke's return, all these episodes were wiped out by the Hollywood director's sweeping axe. In addition, the sound movie equipment was poor, and my English listening ability was poor, from the opening to the closing, I only understood "dat ole davil, sea (that old devil, sea)." Therefore, I left the cinema with a stomach full of resentment. If, according to some people, going to the movies is not to see the film, but to see the stars, then I should be satisfied since I saw Garbo. However, my purpose was exactly the opposite, so I was disappointed, and I became more convinced of my prejudice: a good script has its own value, not in its performance effect; whether the performance effect is good or bad may not be in itself, but outside of itself. Thus, the value of the performance is one thing, and the value of the drama itself is another thing.</p>
<p>From someone who only has the opportunity to read scripts and not the opportunity to see famous actors perform famous plays, I can only think like this. However, we need to know that the reason why O'Neill is recognized as a great American playwright, and why he is considered a great experimenter in drama, is not only because his drama itself has its special achievements, but also because he has added many new techniques to theatrical acting. For example, the success of the performance of "The Emperor Jones," which we know, is the addition of new techniques, because from the beginning to the close of the play, the audience always hears the sound of drums. The sound of the drums initially beats seventy-two times per minute, according to the normal pulse rate. Later, as the plot becomes more tense, the speed of the drums becomes faster and faster, until finally it sounds like a hair trigger. This sound of the drums naturally achieves the effect of making the audience psychologically tense, and makes the performance of the drama even more tense with this sound. In "Strange Interlude," O'Neill added a new trick - the actor's aside. In this play, in addition to the necessary dialogues, the actors use language to explain their thoughts after each sentence. In other words, the audience can use the actor's aside to understand the true feelings of the characters in the play. In "The Great God Brown," we also see a novel attempt, which is to use masks to represent the dual personality of the characters in the play. When the words spoken by a character express his outer self, that character wears a mask. Conversely, when he is expressing what he wants to say in his heart, he takes off his mask. According to many people, this innovation is not a further step in the technique of modern drama, but a step backward, because we can find such mask performances in Greek drama. In our large country, there are also facial makeup patterns. It cannot be said that there is no similar meaning between masks and facial makeup patterns. However, because O'Neill used masks, the old-fashioned conservatives in our country became dizzy and excited, thinking that they had found a foreign basis in Peking Opera, and that Peking Opera could raise its evaluation, which is nonsense. Speaking of this, I want to make a joke using a few words from Curtis, the protagonist of O'Neill's four-act play "The First Man," who changed from a mining engineer to a geologist, and from a geologist to an anthropologist, and to end this section of the article. Curtis, the protagonist of O'Neill's "The First Man," believes that the earliest home of the human race was in Asia. So he wants to "go to the Himalayas and north-central Asia." In this place, he hopes to find our first ancestor. Although this matter has "only one chance in ten million," he believes that he can at least find "well-founded clues." Perhaps in this place, the first man and his way of life can be found. So Mr. Curtis decided to take his wife to China to complete his great undertaking. But his wife died because of childbirth, and although he decided to come to China, O'Neill's script ended when he was about to set off, so he did not tell us whether he found "the first man" in our large country. However, I don't know if the Peking Man (Sinaihropus Pekinnensis) that we recently discovered is qualified to be called "the first man." However, the Peking Opera that preaches for feudal forces is qualified to be said to be the entertainment of "the first man." This "three-part pot" composed of primitive music, folk miscellaneous genres, and local dramas, has neither the literary value of Yuan Dynasty zaju dramas or Ming Dynasty chuanqi dramas, nor the tight structure of modern European and American dramas, nor the ability to express the meaning of life. Today, there are still many old-fashioned conservatives who believe that many of the already rotten parts in the middle can be reformed. But when I take it apart, I always feel that it no longer has a valuable part, nothing that can be retained. The best way to deal with this drama that expresses the life of "mummies" in museums is to send it to the museum as research material for our archaeologists, or like the antiques in the Ancient Palace Museum, send it to foreign countries to open the eyes of foreigners (but be careful not to lose face abroad). Of course, such words from an amateur like me are very easy to offend when this old treasure of "crown of the crown of thorns, the shoulder of a dead cow" is raising its head again, and when the alchemist's art of refining pills, the Yin-Yang school's apocryphal books, and the Taoist's Tai Chi diagrams have all become symbols of spiritual civilization. But how can a young man care about so much?</p>

<h3 id="e196">Regarding the "One Pillar House Poetry" Literary Inquisition <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>I once borrowed from the edicts of Emperor Qianlong to discuss the causes of the Hu Zhongzao poetry inquisition. The discussion was rudimentary and crude, which was unavoidable. This time, I want to talk about the One Pillar House poetry inquisition. I have not seen the records regarding the Xu Shukui case in the Qing Dynasty's records of literary inquisitions. What I am discussing now is based on several personal notebooks. My personal observations are limited, and short essays are not suitable for extensive citations, so shallowness and crudeness are, of course, still unavoidable.</p>
<p>Xu Shukui was from Dongtai County, Jiangsu Province. He was a successful candidate in the imperial examination during the Wu-Wu year of Qianlong. He authored "One Pillar House Poetry" in six volumes, "One Pillar House Small Topic Poetry" in one volume, "Poetry of Tao" in one volume, "Lectures on the Doctrine of the Mean" in one volume, "Miscellaneous Writings from the Qu Juantang Studio" in one volume, "Thoughts for Future Generations" in two volumes, and "Abstracts of the Analects" in two volumes. The first four types were published by his son, Xu Huaizu, in the twenty-eighth year of Qianlong, while the last three were copied and stored at home. After the case came to light in the forty-third year, they were submitted and destroyed. During his lifetime, he seemed to have greatly admired Lü Wanlin and was deeply influenced by him. This is evidenced by the memorials of the ministers who later tried the case, saying: "Xu Shukui, who is already dead in this case, was a successful candidate in the imperial examination of this dynasty. He dared to take the already destroyed heresies of the rebel Lü Liuliang as his guiding principle in compiling poetry collections and lectures, which is already rebellious and unlawful," which can be confirmed. It is evident that there were some intense anti-Manchu sentiments within. Speaking objectively, among the many literary inquisitions of the Qing Dynasty, the One Pillar House poetry inquisition can be considered a case with more factual basis and not entirely unjust.</p>
<p>As for the cause of this case, according to the same memorial—the memorial from Grand Scholar Agui and others regarding the joint trial of the Xu Shukui case:</p>
<p>Xu Huaizu had previously purchased several acres of land from Cai Jiashu's younger brother, Cai Yun, in the same county, for a contract price of one thousand four hundred taels of silver. After his death, Cai Jiashu, because there were ancestral graves within the land, wanted to redeem it in the winter of the forty-second year for nine hundred and sixty taels of silver, but Xu Shitian, Xu Huaizu's son, refused. Consequently, he filed a lawsuit. At that time, the county had already posted a notice in accordance with the imperial decree to investigate and collect prohibited books. In the early fourth month of this year, Xu Shitian heard that Cai Jiashu, because he did not agree to redeem the land, wanted to accuse him of prohibited content in the books printed by his ancestor. On the sixth day of the month, the criminal submitted all the printed books and printing plates to the county. The county magistrate, Tu Yaolong, immediately approved them for review. On the eighth day, Cai Jiashu also submitted books such as "One Pillar House Poetry" and the biography of Xu Shukui written by Shen Deqian to the county, claiming in his submission: fearing there may be prohibited content, without extracting the phrases. The county magistrate, seeing that the biography stated that his "One Pillar House Poetry Collection" had already been printed and listed the titles of Xu Shukui's unpublished books, and that the books submitted by Xu Shitian were not complete, issued a warrant on the eleventh day, specifically ordering the submission of the missing books. Xu Shitian then submitted the three unpublished manuscripts to the county on the sixteenth day, which were approved for submission to the Bureau...</p>
<p>The land disputes of wealthy gentry often became the fuse for the destruction of property and beheadings. This time, it was the same. The county magistrate ordered Xu Shitian to allocate ten acres of grave land to Cai Jiashu, which could have been the end of it, but Cai Jiashu suddenly began to investigate the dates on which Xu Shitian submitted the books. What he found out happened to be not the first date—the sixth—but the date of the supplemental submission—the sixteenth. Thus, he believed that Xu Shitian's submission was after his accusation, and that the county magistrate was bribed and changed the accusation to a submission, intentionally trying to exonerate Xu Shitian. He extracted the rebellious sentences from "One Pillar House Poetry" and reported them to the Jiangning Provincial Administration Office. Lu Yan, a secretary of the Provincial Administration Office, wrote on the back of the petition: "What does this have to do with you! Order the Yangzhou Prefecture Xie Qikun to investigate and try the case, and wrote in the official document: "Searching for books was originally for those with rebellious writings and satirical poems from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Those that are indeed prohibited should be collected and submitted. As for those who discuss scriptures and write articles, expressing them in poems and verses, if only the wording is careless and involves suspicion, and there is no evidence of actual rebellion, the person who first accuses should be punished according to the law with the crime they falsely accused. This is clearly stated in the regulations. If Cai Jiashu is using this to falsely accuse out of resentment, intending to harm him, interrogate him strictly and deliberate." At this time, "One Pillar House Poetry Collection" and other books had already been submitted by Dongtai County to the Jiangning Book Bureau, but because they were not affixed with labels, they were returned to the county for labeling. The process of Lu Yan's remarks and the inside story of the Jiangning Book Bureau can be seen in the testimony of Tao Yi, the Jiangning Provincial Administration Commissioner, who stated:</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Province handled the matter of collecting surviving books, originally setting up a general bureau in Jiangning, dispatching clerks with some knowledge of literature to manage affairs in the bureau. When books were submitted by various prefectures and counties, they were compiled into thousands of volumes and sent to my office, and then submitted to the governor-general for review. As for the books submitted by Xu Shitian of Dongtai County, because I was in the midst of praying for rain during a major drought, I did not actually look at the county report and "One Pillar House Poetry" and other books. The bureau clerk drafted a reply to the county to add labels. In the middle of June, Cai Jiashu came to my office to accuse him, and my secretary Lu Yan ordered the Yangzhou Prefecture to investigate. And in the urging of drafts by the book clerk, he added the words of "false accusation and punishment," which I did not examine carefully, and I signed and approved it. After the education commissioner Liu Yong impeached me, I returned from Xuzhou after inspecting the disaster, and examined the documents, and said to my secretary: "The documents were handled very wrongly." He said: "I had received an imperial decree that self-reporting would be exempt from punishment. This book was submitted by Xu Shitian first, and Cai Jiashu came to accuse him again, so this approval is not a big mistake." I said: "It is still a mistake."...</p>
<p>Xu Shitian submitted the books first, and Dongtai County did not change the accusation to self-reporting. This is a fact; submitting the books first did not allow him to receive the imperial grace of "self-reporting exempts from punishment," which is also a fact. Because the provisions of the Qing Dynasty for submitting prohibited books stated that self-reporting could exempt from punishment, but self-reporting knowing that someone wanted to accuse was only allowed to reduce punishment, but not exempt from punishment. Xu Shitian's self-reporting was only three days away from Cai Jiashu's accusation. The water was already muddy, and it could not wash away the sins of the ancestors. Lu Yan's so-called "received an imperial decree, self-reporting exempts from punishment" was not applicable here; however, his order to the Yangzhou Prefecture to investigate strictly, "If it is a false accusation, punish them according to the law with the crime they falsely accused," in my opinion, was still a fair argument. However, this fair argument, when placed on Emperor Qianlong's scale, would inevitably appear biased, which was also inevitable.</p>
<p>In addition to citing Lü Liuliang's "heresies," the most rebellious thing in the books of One Pillar House was considered to be his own poems with the two lines "In the Ming Dynasty, expect to spread my wings, and take off to Qingdu in one fell swoop." Other accusations included: "Do not let it flow into the soil, for it has long been mixed with filth"; "Which sleeping dragon will follow"; "Dare to say that Heaven is not intentional in resuming brightness"; "Although the court is in chaos, the mountains and forests are well governed"; "Jiangbei has long been without clean soil"; "The sideburns are not the current style, no need to praise my unique purity"; "I do not know the day when the road is cleared of dust, can there be circumstances that offend the imperial chariot"; "Where in the world can be home"; "The old heavenly heart was originally a dream, and recently the world affairs are becoming increasingly absurd" and other sentences. Among these, some are obvious, some are obscure, some are factual, and some are fabricated, and cannot be generalized. But the most interesting thing is the names of Xu Shoufa and Shen Chengzhuo, who are listed as proofreaders. According to the meaning of those old judges, they thought that the "meaning of the two people's names are not clear, and the four characters together are an implied satire of the hair-shaving system of this dynasty," so it is equivalent to "planting a party and howling, which is especially hateful." Now let's look at the testimonies of these two people:</p>
<p>Xu Shoufa testified: Because he had long hair when he was first born, his childhood name was Fa Er. At the age of nine, he followed Xu Shukui to study, who named him Shoufa, and told him the meaning of "body, hair, and skin, received from parents," so the character was Shouzhi. He had heard Xu Shukui say: Shaving the head in this dynasty is not as good-looking as not shaving in the Ming Dynasty. And he claimed that his learning was like that in the Ming Dynasty, which could be compared with Tang Jingzhou's Dong Sibai, but today's people can't see it. He only studied with him for two years, and later he changed to another teacher, changed his name to Shoufa, and took the examination to enter school, which can be checked. According to Shen Chengzhuo's testimony: He studied with Xu Shukui when he was young, who named him. He also heard Xu Shukui say that the Ming Dynasty had hair, and now he shaved his head, which means Zhzhuo. According to each testimony: The names of the proofreaders were added by his son Xu Huaizu when he printed the book after Xu Shukui's death.</p>
<p>In the testimony, some of the words are clearly the result of being implicated, which can be understood at a glance. This is similar to the current criminals who claim that the confessions in the police station are forced by the environment and have to confess, which has the same hidden pain. Even if Xu Shukui named them intentionally, it can't be considered a satire, let alone a rebellion. But what was the result? Not only did Shoufa Chengzhuo, but even their heads were moved together.</p>
<p>Neither keeping their hair nor their heads, this is how to set a good example for those who caused the country to fall.</p>
<p>The ending of the One Pillar House poetry inquisition was that Xu Shukui and his son Xu Huaizu were already dead and were to be dismembered and their heads displayed in accordance with the law of lingchi (death by a thousand cuts); the grandsons of the main offender, Xu Shichu and Xu Shishu, were to be beheaded immediately, and their relatives were implicated; the proofreaders Xu Shoufa, Shen Chengzhuo, the provincial administrator Tao Yi, and his secretary Lu Yan were to be beheaded immediately; Mao Cheng, whose alias was Huang Bin, who wrote the postscript for the poetry of Tao, was to receive one hundred strokes of the cane and exiled three thousand miles; the prefect Xie Qikun was to be sent to the military station for service; the county magistrate Tu Yaolong was to receive one hundred strokes of the cane and one year of imprisonment; Shen Deqian was removed from the local worthies shrine, his official title and posthumous title were revoked, and the imperial stele bestowed upon him was destroyed. Later, except for all the "beheaded immediately" being changed to "beheaded in custody, executed after the autumn," there were no other changes. As for the plaintiff Cai Jiashu, he gained nothing; if it weren't for the "Emperor's" special grace, he would have almost been accused of "knowing the truth early on, not reporting it immediately, and accusing him out of resentment due to land disputes."</p>
<p>The wealthy gentry often have a dream, thinking that by using the hands of others to overwhelm the opponent, they can stand out. Therefore, they are good at being slaves and good at being traitors. However, the blood shed due to the Qing Dynasty's literary inquisitions ultimately soaked the ambition of the patriots and submerged the Manchu's world. The wind of accusation has not stopped, and the blood of the patriots has not dried. This is worthy of deep thought.</p>

<h3 id="e197">What Crime is There in "Hair" and "Powder"? <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ci</p>
<p>It seems that women cannot live without rouge and powder is a universally recognized truth. But no matter how much women love it themselves, a certain force in society does not approve of them dressing up in a showy manner. Saying they don't love it, the faces of their own wives are "娇滴滴越显红自 [radiant and fair]."</p>
<p>Not long ago, there was news in this city of prohibiting female teachers from perming their hair and applying rouge, on the grounds that the huge import figures of the customs were all caused by them, and they were also "not worthy of being teachers"! Recently, Turkey also has similar measures, and said more grandly: "If female teachers imitate actresses and wear brightly colored clothes and fashionable makeup, they will inevitably have a significant adverse impact on the students, so it should be strictly prohibited..."</p>
<p>Summarizing these views, they are mostly against female teachers applying rouge and powder, while other wealthy people's wives or concubines are not subject to the prohibition. Even if they sometimes affect the huge import figures of the customs, or can also "have an adverse impact on society," that is another matter.</p>
<p>The above is considered past facts. And mostly initiated by men. Now it's the women's turn to speak. On the broadcast propaganda of the Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort Committee for Women, a certain lady exclaimed loudly:</p>
<p>"Especially for our women's world, if we can buy one less box of face powder or perm our hair one less time, wouldn't the soldiers at the front have one more vest or one more pair of gloves?"</p>
<p>The meaning is very clear, to make the soldiers at the front have one more vest or one more pair of gloves, just buy one less box of face powder or perm the hair one less time will do. This is the opinion of the women themselves, and this opinion is also worth cherishing. The motivation to comfort the soldiers at the front and being related to social morality are completely different. In such an environment, we can boldly oppose maintaining social morality, but there is no reason to oppose comforting the front-line soldiers. For the sake of comforting, buying one less box of face powder or perming the hair one less time are all extremely appropriate.</p>
<p>But there is still a question here, that is "buy less" or "perm less". The so-called "less" is only reducing the quantity of "buying" and "perming", but not absolutely not "buying" or "perming". Wouldn't it be more beneficial to be able to absolutely not "buy" or not "perm"? However, the women's own opinion is like this.</p>
<p>Such an opinion is very innocent. It shows that women have not given up on cosmetics under the premise of comforting the bandit suppression soldiers. If I am not oversensitive, I would say that the lady who said these words had put on powder and permed her hair before going to the radio station. Why are the opinions of women themselves so opposed to the opinions of some people in society? This is a mystery.</p>
<p>Many people are confused by this mystery. They do not understand why there is such a distance between the two. In fact, this is just a difference in the perspective of interests. Some people must have women dress very simply "in public" in order to show their dignity, while women themselves feel that washing off their makeup will degrade their position. With such a contradiction, although prohibitions are prohibited, applying rouge and powder is still applying rouge and powder, and even under extremely important preconditions, they are not willing to give up this opinion.</p>
<p>If you put your own interests behind, the result will be different. If you don't believe me, there is a report as evidence:</p>
<p>"Ms. Li Shuqing from Shanxi Province, thinking of the country's crisis, petitioned to destroy her family to relieve the national crisis, and presented the document to Chairman Zhao, saying...I have 170 acres of land and a shop in Jingle County...Except for half of the shop that will be reserved for my husband's recuperation, the rest will be offered to the government...I can make a living by serving the country and society or as a home tutor..."</p>
<p>If we have Ms. Li's spirit, not to be shaken by the environment, Ms. Li did not say not to apply rouge or perm her hair, but her contribution is much greater than not applying rouge or perming her hair. Without striving for universal thrift, without striving to cultivate the spirit of sacrificing the individual, and calculating every detail about applying rouge and powder, it is really "abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, I do not know what can be achieved!"</p>
<h3 id="e198">Taiping Bridge <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Lu</p>
<p>The sound of the night watchman's clapper was not far away when a group of people with horse lanterns walked towards Taiping Bridge. The four leading men were dressed as servants, holding willow branches picked from the roadside, with the bark rolled back and tied into a ball of flowers hanging at the top. As they walked, the willow ball swung back and forth in the dim light like their victorious hearts.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>When they reached the bottom of Taiping Bridge, the four men gave a coded command. The men behind them in short clothes immediately rolled up their sleeves, tugged up their trouser legs, and the crowbars, ropes, iron pry bars, and all the tools were distributed in everyone's hands. It turned out that they were starting to dismantle Taiping Bridge.</p>
<p>Since the rickshaws were popular in the county town, the high stone bridges were either dismantled or filled in. Only the few large bridges passing over the official river cost a little project to rebuild the flat stone bridges. Taiping Bridge was located in the westernmost part of the county town, close to the border of the neighboring county. The nearby areas were all poor households and temporary accommodations for people from other provinces, so Taiping Bridge would not hinder the traffic of rickshaws, because the people living near Taiping Bridge simply did not have the money to take rickshaws, and they had strong legs like the rickshaw pullers. Moreover, Taiping Bridge had been passed down in this county town as the authority capable of dominating the residents' peace: no matter whether the rich or the prominent married, the bride and groom's sedan chairs had to circle around Taiping Bridge to ensure the peace of the whole house. Therefore, after rickshaws had been popular for a year, all the bridge piers had been demolished into flat ground, but no one had proposed to demolish Taiping Bridge.</p>
<p>But these buildings, bridges, and stone steps built thousands of years ago are all excellent materials, and the contractors who dismantled the bridges made a fortune for each bridge they dismantled. Then, where there is profit, some people dare to come out and propose to dismantle the only remaining bridge, Taiping Bridge, in the county town, because the contractors have local gentlemen backing them. It was during some meeting that the proposal to demolish Taiping Bridge was passed for the sake of traffic convenience.</p>
<p>The news and the execution were equally fast. On the one hand, the internally appointed contractor obtained the bidding rights for the demolition of the bridge, and on the other hand, the residents near Taiping Bridge gathered together to deal with the demolition contractor...</p>
<p>One morning, a man carrying a wooden sign and beating a gong walked west along the street to report that Taiping Bridge was going to be demolished. This is a custom. It is said that when demolishing a bridge or breaking ground, children cannot run out of the house, otherwise their souls will be taken away to suppress the project. But the children's souls were not taken away, but the gong beater was injured at the foot of Taiping Bridge and died in less than a day.</p>
<p>This is naturally an expression of the anger of the residents who believe in Taiping Bridge's ability to dominate the peace of the town. So the contractor consulted the great gentlemen behind him, and the gentlemen naturally held a so-called meeting. —Originally, it was easy for the great gentlemen to deal with the small people, but in this matter, it was feared that someone would be killed. If someone was killed, it would naturally alarm the county government. Then, this big fortune that was steadily in hand might be overturned by those foolish little people.</p>
<p>The project of demolishing Taiping Bridge was cold for a month.</p>
<p>This day, they started work in the middle of the night, which was the result of a month of deliberation. When the people who got up the earliest in the city got up, the bridge piers of Taiping Bridge had already been dismantled. The four servants were divided into two groups, protecting the workers like guards. Two people in a group were sweating and laboriously dismantling the stone steps with iron pry bars, which looked several times more laborious than paving a stone bridge.</p>
<p>After hiding their children at home, the small people gradually gathered around the bridge abutment. Several strong men stood up in front and questioned the servants, asking them why they were demolishing Taiping Bridge. The servants who came out to do the work had forgotten their own status. They gently swung the willow balls in their hands and used their eyebrows to give the spokesmen the most embarrassing answer.</p>
<p>In addition to having strong legs like rickshaws, these strong men also had iron-like fists. Seeing the dog-like fangs and claws, they would deal with them in the same way as they had dealt with the gong beater.</p>
<p>They immediately retreated two steps, pointed to the forehead of the man at the front with the willow ball, and cursed:</p>
<p>"Good! You pigs, who beat up Ah Gen, arrest him and send him to the yamen to face trial!"</p>
<p>What small person is not afraid of facing trial? The women rushed forward and grabbed the men's arms. It would be better to demolish Taiping Bridge than to face trial. Even if the poor people could ensure the peace of the whole house, they still had the problem of eating, which was more important than peace. Men are their best meal ticket!</p>
<p>On the day of completion, when several gentlemen came to inspect, the bright rickshaws were easily dragged across the bridge.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Eagle's Cry <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Wu</p>
<p>— Village Notes —</p>
<p>When the clear, trembling cry of an eagle circled in the sky, I often unconsciously walked to the center of the courtyard, looked up at the sky, and searched for the eagle that sang the greatness of nature and the embrace of nature.</p>
<p>The eagle's song reminded me of a strong man, of a great man who soared high in the sky and looked down on the world, of a free, unrestrained, and upright man. It is the majestic, inspiring, and full-of-spirit cry of one who faces everything squarely.</p>
<p>Often I searched the sky, far away, or right above my head, and I could see the eagle's entire body. My heart was broadened, and my heart seemed to be on the eagle's back. I was also circling, looking down on the sky. For half a day, until I saw it fly far away, I disappointedly returned to the dark room.</p>
<p>How good it would be to be able to fly? Although many people have flown past with human intelligence, I still only see a few feet around, as if watching the world in a prison.</p>
<p>I am grateful to those few eagles. When the sun climbs above the horizon, I hear the clear, sharp song. Sometimes when the sun falls behind that high mountain, they seem to be chasing the sun, flying west, circling, and I forget that the surrounding mountains have trapped my eyes and that I have forgotten the silent village life that is almost half-dead. There is young blood jumping in my brain, and my thoughts escape the shabby calculations of life.</p>
<p>One day, a neighbor's child told me that a family had caught two eagles. When I heard this, it was as if my own brother had been arrested. I rushed to the house and saw a young eagle locked in a bamboo cage. On the ground, there was another large eagle lying softly, bleeding from its abdomen, its eyes wide open, and its sharp beak hooked on the edge of a broken table. I saw the smiles on the faces of the few people in the family, with their yellow teeth, and in my heart I cursed them: despicable people, it does you no harm, but you use what means to assassinate it and capture them?</p>
<p>I looked at the eagle in the cage. It was jumping, its green eyes staring hatefully at people, shaking its hemp-like feathers, and suddenly raised its head and cried out clearly. Startled by this unexpected cry, I was determined to listen to the brave man who seemed to appear before my eyes. He was questioning the unnecessary harm to him and the shameful actions against him.</p>
<p>I heard the eagle cry again. After this, I heard the eagle cry and felt that there was an angry voice cursing humanity in their cries.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Feelings After Buying Books <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Jie</p>
<p>I've always had a penchant for buying books; however, due to economic constraints, I've never been able to indulge in a truly satisfying book-buying spree. Consequently, to this day, my book collection remains quite small.</p>
<p>What I found most regrettable was that last October, we had moved to a county town in Zhejiang. At that time, I was holding down a minor job, earning several tens of dollars a month, which was comparatively a period of economic ease for me; therefore, I desperately wanted to buy more books. Every day, I eagerly searched for bookstores on the street, but in reality, I unexpectedly encountered another setback: I couldn't find a single decent bookstore in that place. By the time I returned at the end of the year, my pockets were once again completely empty.</p>
<p>Today, I finally managed to buy a few books, but it evoked memories. I feel there are two issues regarding buying books that need to be discussed:</p>
<p>1.  The price of books is too high;</p>
<p>2.  The locality of books is too narrow.</p>
<p>Due to the first limitation, books are out of reach for readers with low purchasing power; due to the second limitation, books are out of reach for readers confined to remote areas.</p>
<p>This cannot but be seen as a huge crisis in the reading world! Booksellers, focused on shiny silver coins, may disregard it, but this weakens the dissemination of books and reduces their audience.</p>
<p>Books are a record of culture. Now, as our nation is encountering an unprecedentedly difficult period of struggle, culture is precisely what is needed to exert its highest degree of function to demonstrate its great power, so that it can vigorously fulfill the task of national defense. The progress of culture is not only a vertical deepening, but also a horizontal expansion; it is not only an upper-level study, but also a lower-level activity. In order to broadly appeal, then the readership with low purchasing power and the readership confined to remote areas are precisely the best targets! The most important targets!</p>
<p>In fact, these two types of readers are precisely the bearers of the times, and guaranteeing victory must be achieved through them. So, should we kick these heroic partners aside?</p>
<p>I understand their pain, and have personally experienced it: hovering at the entrance of bookstores, harboring a strong desire, craning one's neck to look at the book list. Occasionally seeing a "masterpiece," the heart feels pricked, knowing it is an inaccessible treasure, but still eagerly flipping through it with affection, even holding it in one's hands for a long time, cherishing it. Finally, a stick comes crashing down: the price of the book looms like an enlarged wheel turning in front of you, and one can only bid it farewell with a red face, watching it fall into someone else's arms. At this time, one not only feels pain and resentment, but even jealousy and anger towards others. Can the world allow such cruel facts to exist?</p>
<p>As for readers confined to remote areas, they are also pitiful. The appearance of new culture is almost like a moon in the sea, forever just a shadow, and the two seem to have forgotten each other. Last year in Zhejiang, I lived in a relatively large county town, and transportation was also convenient; but in the only institution of higher learning there—just a middle school—I saw a heartbreaking phenomenon. A school publication was supposed to introduce the latest literary books, but the list consisted entirely of early works from the Creation Society; and for them, it was considered unprecedented and novel!</p>
<p>Those engaged in cultural work, please pay attention to these!</p>

<p>Sino-Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Water Margin: Tiger Fighting"</p>
<p>Heroes have always been strong-willed. They fear no tigers and leopards on high peaks. Not believing the innkeeper's roundabout words. Seeing the notice, posted far and wide. On Jingyang Ridge, there is a striped tiger nearby. Lonely travelers risk their lives. Beating gongs to alert the crowd to be wary. Wu Song laughs and declares. Tipsy, he takes his stick up the mountain. Coincidentally, the fifteenth night is bright. From afar, the steep ridge is densely forested. He doesn't believe that there is a tiger's den in the hollow. Who knows that suddenly a wind arises. From the forest jumps a vicious tiger. With bare claws and bared teeth, it wants to show off its strength. Wu Song raises his eyebrow-level staff. Breaking it in mid-air, he is alarmed. Luckily, he is skilled in boxing and knows many secrets. His fame for tiger-fighting spreads everywhere. The hero's mettle is unmatched in the world.</p>

<p>Opening "Autumn Window Lament" (Mimi Collection Launch Issue)</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue is thought-provoking. Why create grievances and secretly hurt people? I want to comfort my parents and make them happy. Be content, frugal, and thrifty. Last night, a sudden letter arrived. Therefore, I hurriedly bid farewell and turned home. Hearing my mother's words, my heart is breaking. Although it's not true, it's hard to argue. I've never been to brothels or flower lanes. Let alone female entertainers. I am a respectable descendant of the Fengxi family. How could I lose my integrity and learn to be modern? My family is poor and I haven't studied much. At the young age of thirteen, I learned a trade. I am grateful for the recommendations of the elders. I am a radio broadcaster at a middle school. A year has passed in the blink of an eye. It neither benefits nor harms the company. I only hope that I will flourish and progress day by day. So that one day, I can establish a career and make a name for myself. Who knew that trouble would arise out of nowhere. Causing me to feel ashamed before my clan. What are you saying? No wind rises. No waves surge. What are you saying? No shrimp jumps. The water doesn't move. I am a wronged soul this life. I want to throw myself into the Pujiang River and become a water spirit. But I haven't repaid my parents' nurturing grace.</p>

<p>Opening "Xunyang Lute"</p>
<p>Tonight in Xunyang, an autumn on the river. The moonlight clearly sends off a departing boat. The old woman married to a merchant. The lute laments forever new sorrows. My heart is breaking, the guest lingers, tears fall like drops on the Jiujiang River. The mournful strings fly into my ears. I already see cold flowers hiding willows in shame. Blue silk accompanies a lone boat, the wind is tight, except for the sound of bitter bamboo islands. Touching the hands, the pearl concerns is lost. Floating life, old dreams of brocade entangling the head. Reeds and lonely moorings surrounded by land. The pattern on her skirt is of old pomegranates. Four strings, five fingers autumn, sound sound goes to wake the gull. A new tune is sung on the water during the night. Looking to where the garden is, geese return. Head for home, a full sail in autumn. The song ends with the guest's separation and sorrow.</p>

<p>The Yingyin Amateur Society is now offering thanks to listeners who have always supported our society. We have obtained consent from Zhen De Pharmaceutical Factory to widely distribute their interesting Kangfu Ten Clever Boards. However, due to excessive costs, starting this Sunday, we will hold weekly riddle-guessing prize games to increase interest. The restriction method is that during the broadcast, only the names of the songs will be announced, and listeners must guess the names of the singers who performed them. Those who guess more than half correctly will be awarded a Kangfu Ten Clever Board. The method is simple and quite interesting. Please pay attention to our society's broadcast times and announcements at any time. For inquiries, please send a letter to Mr. Chen Tao, 41, Lane 155, South Chengdu Road, addressed to the society.</p>
<p>The Realist Opera Society has printed and distributed a "Love's Lingering" song selection to all sectors.

<h3 id="e206">Chaplin's New Film: Regency Period <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Chaplin has four new scripts following "Modern Times." One is a highly satirical novel published in New York's Modern Review, set in Hollywood, depicting the life of a big producer. Chaplin himself is scheduled to play the main character, the big producer. He discovers a young woman among the extras, tries to marry her, but later the young woman runs off with most of his property. It is also scheduled that the young woman will be played by Paulette Goddard.</p>
<p>But later he planned another work, written by a young writer, with Chaplin and Goddard as the main characters. The general idea is that Chaplin is living happily, a millionaire with a very beautiful and intelligent wife. Suddenly, the Second World War breaks out, and he is drafted into the army. On the battlefield, he is a soldier subordinate to a former servant in his house. He is regarded as a spy, and even performs outstanding service. When he returns home after the war, his wife has left and his family is broken, and he becomes a pitiful, lonely wanderer. At this time, he falls in love with Paulette Goddard—a woman who has suffered the same misfortune, and he eventually dies bitterly.</p>
<p>The third is a script specifically exposing the ugliness of Hollywood. He said he wants to declare: "The true face of Hollywood, which so many people in the world yearn for," and he uses a profound pen to dissect the capitalistic atmosphere and decadent life of Hollywood.</p>
<p>In addition, he has many new film plans. Among these new films, after much selection and consideration, he finally officially decided on two new films. One of them, which has already begun filming, is called Regency. We will temporarily translate it as "Regency Period." The original work of this script is by the modern British novelist D.L. Murry, the screenwriter is R.V. Bdley, the director is Chaplin, and the main actress is Paulette Goddard. It is said that he does not plan to appear in this film. One thing that deserves our attention is that this film is entirely spoken with dialogue, and the dialogue in the play is written by the great American playwright Louis Sinclair. Its value is imaginable.</p>
<p>The second film will only be starred by him and her, and will be started after "Regency Period" is finished. The content and naming of the film have not yet been announced, but it is only known that Chaplin in this film will appear to us in a "modernized" appearance. He will abandon his small hat, torn shoes, and tattered clothes and put on modern fashionable clothes. It is said that this is his attempt to "change his style," but the "no-speaking doctrine" is still something he holds onto tightly.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Yuan Meiyun in "Guangling Tide" <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<h3 id="e208">Star Intelligence <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Since the release of "United Hearts," business has been excellent. Following this film, Ying Yunwei will engage in Yang Hansheng's new work "Night Flight," a work with smuggling issues and student movements as its theme.</p>
<p>Chen Boer has not yet decided on a new work after "United Hearts." Yuan Muzhi is preparing his new work "Crossroads," which he wrote and directed.</p>
<p>"Crossroads" has been filmed for two-thirds, and there are still some very important exterior shots to be taken.</p>
<p>"Night Flight" must also be completed before the end of the lunar year, and filming will begin after "Crossroads" completes its exterior shots. In this way, the two factories will have three films filming at the same time.</p>
<p>Many students visit the filming of "Crossroads," including those from Jiaotong University, Daxia University, Guanghua University, and Fudan University, perhaps because this film depicts the lives of unemployed college students.</p>
