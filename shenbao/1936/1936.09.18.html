<h3 id="c9">國際聯盟之復活問題 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>方吾人紀念慘痛之九月十八日。日內瓦方面。有國際聯盟行政院會議之舉行。而國際聯盟之大會。亦於九月廿一日開幕。憶五年以前。日本以暴力佔我東北。予國際聯盟以空前之打擊。日內瓦和平組織已受致命之傷。乃五年之間。意大利德意志諸國對於國聯盟約。破壞不遺餘力。在侵略國「拳脚交加」之下。國聯已奄奄一息。能否得救。端賴於本屆行政院會議及大會中各代表之努力。吾人際此危念時代。顏對於此和平機構之孑遺。貢獻數言。</p>
<p>圖國聯之復活。應努力之事。千端萬緖。然大要言之。國聯組織之改正。裁軍規定之勵行。制裁條欵之嚴密化。更改國際條約以符合和平需要。及應用門戶開放原則於各會員國。乃最急迫之要求。行政院為歐洲數强國所把持。以中國之大。無常任理事之席。此國聯威望不能普及全球之大原因。宜以洲別為單位。或以人口多寡為標準。重分配理事席次。使國聯能民主化。不致為少數强國所把持。此其一。裁軍為盟約最大目的所在。然至今該項規定尙未實行。國聯旣未草定具體詳盡之裁軍計劃。各國更無接受之誠意。軍備不裁。猜忌加甚。戰爭之原因未去。弭戰之工作實難。此其二。</p>
<p>制裁條文。應用於意阿戰爭。竟完全失敗。此實國聯史上絕大悲劇。今欲國聯復活。與其廢除制裁之規定。不如使盟的十六條更實際化。卽制裁義務。各國之負担有別。如同一洲之內。有侵略之事發生。各國負軍事制裁之。責而世界他國僅負經濟制裁之責。如欲遠道之邦亦用武力相助。非其所願。如彼等仍以經濟上之需要品供給侵略。國則制裁必歸無效。故區域恊定。必與集體和平同時存在。則儆兇頑懲罪惡。方可收效也。此為本屆大會之討論中心問題。亦有關於國聯之存亡生死者也。</p>
<p>至於圖永久之和平。尙有賴於積極之工作。徒守現狀。則不平之鳴不能勉强抑制。和平之基礎。應建設於正義及互助之上。故有違正義。有乖國際之自由平等原則之條約及事實。均宜隨時修改。盟的雖有修改條約之規定。過去未嘗應用。國際互助。則有賴於經濟上之相依相賴。相供相求。門戶開放。較之於閉關自守。其影響於人類者大有不同。近聞國聯有召集第二次經濟會議之說。蓋亦有鑒於此。惟有經濟上之共存共榮。可以達政治上之相安無事。和平之道。似繁而實簡。願國聯諸國代表再三留意焉。</p>

<p>（紐約）美國前總理史汀生所著「遠東危機之同憶與觀察」一書、將於今日由外交關係恊會出版、中國在書內頗佔重要地位、史氏並於書中、述及日本侵略滿洲時、美國政策之基本原則如下、</p>
<p>（一）履行各項條約義務、以維持中美兩國未來友好關係、</p>
<p>（二）維護合作行動之某礎、以保持世界之和平、據史氏自稱、以上兩項原則、常被人批評、謂其已經過外交行動常軌、史氏之言則曰、「余已有準備應付此種批評、卽在平時、身為外交部長者、亦不能容其目光為臨時發生之事實所遮蔽、但時如今日、每日幾皆有新發展之事發生、對於將來、或將有重大影響、且對於全部目的抱狹小見解、其危險亦因之大為增加」、</p>
<p>史氏書中又述及中國云、「中國之前途為時代中一絕大問題、現有一事頗為明白者，卽中國必須自行發展、决不能受外來勢力之統制或驅使、使其成為一種外來的不需要之演進、中國有世界最久遠之文化、已有四千年之歴史、可資蹬明、中國內部文化中之和平性質、實為目下亞洲主要之穩定原素、中國失此原素、將直接影響其鄰國之和平、美國其一也、如此項喪失、係因美國不顧條約義務而造成、則此項政策、未免過於短見、一部份美人以為欲解决滿洲問題、必須由日美兩國商妥一種利於日本之辦法者、實屬錯誤、蓋彼等已忘却此滿洲問題、乃係中國最重要之基本問題也、目下如有恊定或辦法能使日本同意者、在中國方而必認之為破壞而厭棄之」、</p>
<p>史氏復論及英美兩國合作之努力、謂一九三二年二月、世事益趨黑暗、彼卽與胡佛總統高議之後、向英國駐美大使提議、英美兩國、共同履行九國公約義務、以阻止日本之行動、數日後、史氏又於大西洋無綫電話中、與常時英國外相西門爵十談話、促其贊同、史氏又云、「余復於二月十三及十五兩日」在倫敦與西門爵士談及此事、西門對於余之建議、雖未有明白之拒絕、但視其態度、已可明瞭英政府不願加入、故余亦不再催促矣」、</p>
<p>於是史氏乃致書參議員波拉重申美國之堅持不承認政策、史氏繼述及美國與英國將來合作之必要一節日、「余曾切實說明吾人與英政府合作之經騐、深信歐洲集體行動之最後發展、無論其是否經過目前國聯之手、抑取他道、領導之偉大責任、必將由英政府與其自治領負之、此實不可避免者，余信此種領導責任、不得因集體行動將受非國聯會合員如美政府等所中梗之畏念而受阻滯、此為至要之道、為担保此種安全與兩政府之合作計、一切執行步驟之在國際行動中佔重要部分者、必須直誠·有效·與具有傳統性云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c68">怎樣提倡農村副業（上） <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 中央農業實驗所副所長錢天鶴</p>
<p>一·怎樣呌農村副業</p>
<p>在沒有解釋農村副業之先，先來講怎樣呌副業。副業，其本身原無一定的標準，不過是正業的相對名詞。我們概括言之，就是從事某種職業為其生計的中心事業，更把其剩餘的時間和勞力，經營其他職業，以增加收人，而補助其生計的中心事業的不足，這種其他職業，就是副業；這生計的中心事業，就是正業。譬如一個泥水匠，平時有工做就樹工，沒有工做就拉黃包車，道拉車子就是副業，做泥水匠就是正業。再如一個銀行職員，平時在行內服務工作，這是正業，但他在公餘之暇，另外種植一些蔬菜園藝，除自己家庭享用之外，把其餘的販賣到市塲，得些利益，這是副業。</p>
<p>所謂農村副業，就是其生計的中心事業必定是農業，所經營的人必定是農民。農民除經營其生計的中心事業之外，把餘剩的時間和勞力，或利用隙地殘料，或將農產品加工製造，從事生產；或直接出賣勞力做短工，以增加收入，來補助其中心事業的不足的，都謂之農村副業。如普通的農村，大部農民是栽培稻麥，但種稻麥不要整年種地，所以農閒的時候，就來織草鞋呀，做木匠呀，做小販呀，等等的工作，這種稻麥的職業，因為是他生計的中心事業，所以是正義；如織草鞋呀，做木匠呀，做小販呀，因為是利用剩餘時間和勞力去經營的，所以是副業。而道生計的中心事業，——種稻麥，是農業的一部分，並且這副業的經營者是農民，所以謂之農村副業。</p>
<p>上面說過，正業和副業是兩個相對的名詞，在農村間更其顯著。譬如水利好的地方，農民以種稻為正業，搓繩捕魚等為副業；海濱漁村，則以大部分的勞力經營漁業，所有餘力，則利用之以事耕作；甚至同居一村，在甲戶是副業，在乙戶却是正業，所以正業和副業在其事業的本身上，是不許可有肯定的判斷的。</p>
<p>並且，農村副業很容易受環境的變遷和外力的侵佔而轉換：譬如某一地方，大部分農民，本來是以土木縫工為副業的，但近年來因為農村經濟破產，和地方不靖等緣故，有綫的人都已搬進城去，剩下的貧民，房屋要蓋也蓋不起，衣服要做也做不起，這般土木匠和裁縫，因此就無工可做，不得不改換其他的副業來補助其正業的不足。又如某地方的農民，是以織草鞋為副業的，現在忽新與了一種織草帽的工作，獲利比較草鞋來得厚，因此以前當織草鞋為副業的農民，現在都改換織草帽為副業了。再如某一種副業的出品，市塲需要特別增加，這種副業，就會特別的發達；反之，就漸行衰落，甚或消滅。所以農村副業，時常在變換，時常在興衰。</p>
<p>二·為什麼要提倡農村副業</p>
<p>（一）耕地不足　以往我們總是說我國「地大物博」，但現經調查統計之後，知道地是的確很大，不過這般大地不都是能耕種的地。據翁文灝先生說：「中國因地理的限制，大多數地方不適於人類生活，或不能容納許多人口，中國人民，不得不集中在很少數幾個地方：（一）甲原區（白河黃河及淮河平原），（二）揚子江中下游平原，（三）以上平原附近的邱陵地，（四）浙閩粵東南沿海區，（五）四川盆地。以上五個區域總算起來，面積七十萬方哩（平方英里），佔全國面積百分之十七弱，而人口則有三萬五千萬，佔全國百分之八十三强，密度總平均每方哩多至五百人，遠在日本德國以上，與荷蘭相近，而其中的中原區與揚子區人口之多，且遠在世界各國中人口密度最高的英國和比國以上。若照以上人口密度及一方哩的四千畝計算，那末每人可以分到的土地面積，中原區每入得六畝，揚子區每人得四畝七分，邱陵區及東南沿海區年人得十一畝，四川盆地每人得六畝半，總平均每人得六畝半（至於每人分得畝數較多的區域，並不是那邊的人民較富，而是因為那邊的土地不好）。而且事實上每人分得的土地，還不盡是可以耕種的，因為上列地畝內，還包括不少的，山巒，江湖，第宅，道路等面積，若專從耕地計算，每人分得的田產，大的只得三畝田地」。（獨立評論第三期）</p>
<p>再來看看中央農業實騐所的估計，知道我國農家經營之土地面積，以十畝以下者為最多，計佔總農戶百分之三十六，十畝至二十畝者次之，佔百分之十四，三十畝至五十畝者，佔百分之八；更就此等數字綜合觀之，則二十畝以下之農戶，合計佔總農戶百分之六十一，若每家以五口計算，則每人耕地面積的為四畝弱，與翁先生佔計之數大致相符。（詳細估計載農情報吿第三年第四期）</p>
<p>由上述兩械估計看來，每個農人平均只有三畝至四畝耕地，而一切衣食生活，都要取給於是，任你地政專家改良分田，地畝是不會多長些出來，任你農業專家改良栽培方法，一畝也難能出產二畝地的東西，縱使一畝能產出二畝地的東西，每人分得的也不過六七畝，遝是不足維持生活的。據專家的說法，一個農民要維持他適當的生活，大約要四十畝的耕地。所以現在我國耕地的不足，已至極點，農民的生計，不從副業上想補救，實在無以維持。這就是要提倡農村副業的第一種原因。</p>
<p>（二）勞力過剩　在上面講過，在七十萬方哩的面積裏，容納着一萬五千萬的農民，地少人多，因之每年空餘的時間甚多。據金陵大學教授卜克先生的調查估計，我國農民每年勞動的時間，眞正化在農作物生產上面的，若每日每個農民的工作以十小時計算，那末一年幷算起來，不過祗要三個月就可做完了，其餘九個月，一部分是枉費掉的，譬如出賣農產品，大家不設法聯合起來用船運或卡車運，却一個一個地一擔一擔地挑着送進城市去，這精神勞力花費了不算，時間枉過了實在可惜。還有一部分時間，因為沒有適當的工作做，便消耗在坐茶店賭錢等不正當的娛樂上。所以這許多過剩的勞力，不把副業去利用，而增加他們的收入，於農民的生計，於地方的秩序，都要受很大的影響。這就是要提倡農村副業的第二種原因。</p>
<p>（三）殘料和隙地的利用俗話說磚頭木屑都有用，尤其是農村間，簡直沒有不可利用的東西。譬如利用田間的靑草來飼養牛羊，牛羊長大了可以賣錢，牛羊的糞便可以吧田，這就是很好的副業。桑梗，我們都把牠作燃料，但桑樹皮可以造紙，在農暇的時候就可以剝下來，或者自己造，或者大家合起來造，甚至賣給紙廠，也可增加收入，這都是一般人忽略的利用殘料來作副業。</p>

<p>分合作靑苗儲押等　總放三百八十一萬</p>
<p>新聲社云、浙江地方銀行、鑒於農村經濟日趨凋敝、農業資余瀕於枯竭、農民生計日益艱難、特設農工貸欵處、負責辦理農業及小本工業貸欵、自辦理以來、頗收成效、茲訪報吿如下、</p>
<p>農業合作貸款</p>
<p>救濟農村、如以台作方式、奠其基礎、則無資本集中之患、而有分配公平之效、其繁榮滋長、可立足而待也、是以農業金融機關五欵、自常以農村合作社為對象、以收事半功倍之效、我國辦理農村合作社、遠在十年以前、迨北伐告成、各省農村信用合作社、紛事組織、顧以我國農村環境不良、與農民智識缺乏、目前欲求組織健全、社員能瞭解合作眞義之合作社、尙不多觀、際此情勢、欲全藉合作組織、以調劑農村經濟、無論數量上質量上、似均嫌不足、本行對合作社放欵、自始卽予提倡、並規定以貸欵於農民所組織之合作社、為農貸之原則、顧以碍於上述各項原因、兼之浙省各地合作社、多就近與當地農業金融機關、發生關係、故合作社貸欵業務之推進、似稍遲緩、惟遇合作社貸欵數額較大者、或須舉辦特種業務而需欵時、則輒向本行貸借、總計最近一年、除貸欵與各地農業金融機關、轉放合作社貸欵外、直接貸欵合作社數額、達二十八萬四千餘元、</p>
<p>農業靑苗貸款</p>
<p>靑苗放欺、為增加農民生產、促進農業改良之第一步、關係農業、旣深且重、蓋農民當春耕下種時、對於種子肥料之選擇、以及農具機器等耕作之設備、往往因缺乏資金、因陋就簡、敷衍從事、其望良好之收穫也難矣、共至凶歲之後、貧乏至不能下種者、亦所在多有、處此情况之下、設無低利貸欵之金融機關、以資周轉、則一般農民、勢必仍仰給於舊式之高利貸欵、所謂飲鴆止渴、其害彌深、將益使農村陷於崩潰之境也、本行洞鑒斯旨、對於農業靑苗貸欵、推行不遺餘力、於於潛寗波杭縣等十餘處試辦、成績頗佳、農民均能將借欵用於生產之途、並準期還欵、無一積欠、截止本年六月底止、此項放欵總額、計二十二萬七千五百餘元、</p>
<p>農倉儲押貸款</p>
<p>農倉儲押貸欵、在本行農業貸欵中、最佔重要、其數額亦最大、良以本行分行有五十餘處、遍及全省各重要城鎭、大都均附有倉庫、辦理是項業務、殊為便捷、每當農產品收穫時期、價格往往低落、農民需欵、卽可以米穀豆麥等向木行介庫儲押、手續簡便而利益殊多、一年來貸欵出總數、計三百萬零五千餘元、此外並貸欵於各縣農業金融機關所辦農倉、作為流動資金、藉以儲押米榖、在本行亦得稍盡偶導之責、與輔助之力、成績頗為良好也、</p>
<p>零星動產質押</p>
<p>近年以來、農村需要金融之調齊、極為迫切、而放欵對象之合作社、組織維艱、以致金融機關對農村放欵、雖盡推行之力、未收普遍之功、吾人憑以往之經騐、深知農民頗能遵守信用、非至萬不得已時、决不肯對所負債務、有抵賴或延期不還情事、是亦未能以其無合作組織卽不予以貸欵之機會、惟有舉辦典當式之農村零星動產質押放欵、以為補救之法、藉達救濟之、此項放欵、其抵押品之範圍、包括衣服·金銀·銅鐵器皿、以及原料種子等、蓋此類押品、為一般農民所盡有、往昔本可隨時向典當質押、以資周轉、乃自年來內地典業、受潮流打擊、不能維持而閉歇者、比比皆是、卽能勉强維持者、而緊縮口氣（卽當價扣抵）封門（卽限制最高押價為數元、及每日放欵總額、以數白元為度）、等情形、輒於金融緊軋時發現、其影響農民生計者、殊非淺鮮、故際此農村合作社、尙未普遍設立、典當業奄奄一息之時、舉辦典當式農村零星動產質押貸欺、實為救濟農民之當前亟務、本行有鑒於此、爰於二十三年二十四年、在湖州蘭豁二分行及長興辦事處、先後試辦、不但農民稱便、且到期都能贖取、絕無沒貨、二十五年一月、木行添設龍流辦事處、其主要工作、幾全為經營此項業務、他若奉化嘉善等處、現亦堪定房屋、開辦有日矣、再本行辦理是項貸欵、對於押品、足保險、而利息保管等費併計、僅有每月一分五厘、允輕農民負祖、總計是項押欵總額、截止本年六月底、達二十九萬六千元、</p>
<p>連環保證信用</p>
<p>本行對農業貸欵、向主普遍、力求實效、對於勤樸貧苦而尙未加入合作社之農民、其有零星動產、可資質押者、得依本行零星動產質押貸欺章程質押欵項、其確無動產可質、而忠實勤懇者、亦予以貨欵之機會、以增强其生產能力、此本行創設連環保證信用貸欵之旨也、其貸欺辦法、借欵人祇須就相識中、（大部分為農民）覓具本行認可之保證人三人、連環担保、卽可申請貸欵、蓋如此、一方面忠誠之農民、得有金融週轉之便利、一方面可以使其明瞭連帶負責之意義、引起台作興味、藉為將來組織合作社之基礎、現在試行者、有杭縣凌家橋等處、放欵共計五千餘元、數額雖不為多、而佃農獲受實惠則不淺、亦可謂有相當之成效、現擬極力擴展、以期推行於其他各地、總上各項農村貸欵、總額達三百八十一萬八千餘元、地域分佈、徧及全省各重要城鎭、雖貸欵方式、各有不同、然其嘉惠農村之目的則一也、</p>

<h3 id="c98">歐亞公司航空保險　每客保額萬元可以加保　國內尚屬初辯手續簡單 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>中央社云、歐亞航空公司、辦理航空保險、業見報載、昨據京電傳保險辦法、乘客須先聲請投保、而保費則另加五成云云、記者特往該公司探訊、據悉、該項保險、業於一日實行、而所定辦法及保費等、與電傳頗多出入、茲特將確情誌後、</p>
<p>每客保額萬元</p>
<p>該公司與保之合同、每客保額為一萬元、保費在票價內、由公司承擔、故係被動保險之性質、在購票時或特的飛行時、或由公司填給公事票、均按飛行之里程計算、保費送交保險公司、而遇發生意外時、旅客卽可將客票向公司請求賠償、公司飛航人員、如機師機械員無綫電員等、向來由公司另為個人保險、如不在原機內服務時、則亦塡給客票、其保率最高時、的為客票百分之五、</p>
<p>規定賠償條件</p>
<p>旅客如欲加保、則亦有加保之保費、依照每萬元計算、為四百公里以內三元、四百零一至一千公里為四元、一千公里以上為六元、亦不日卽可實行、至於賠償之條件為（一）因飛機失事而死亡（二）因飛機失事完全殘廢、至（三）因飛機失事受傷致短時間內完全不能工作時、每日給付至多十元之養傷費、其請求賠償時、除上述之客票或票根外、並須提出執有發證醫師之證明書、或地方官吏之證明、但保險公司、得保留另行自派醫師復騐之權、至對請求人之承受權認為有疑義時、請求人應自行依非訟事件程序、取具法院之確認文件、</p>
<p>辦理極為審慎</p>
<p>該公司因此次保險、在國內尚屬初次辦理、故接洽進行、甚為審愼、務求辦理之手續簡單、且保費必須低廉、以不向旅客另外收取保費為前提、經多方之接洽、始與德國許秋加公司商洽成功、故現正呈請交通部備案、並將詳細辦法、印發各地分站及辦事處遵照辦理、此種保險實行後、該公司之業務、當更發達云、</p>

<p>（駐菲特維記者顏文初寄）</p>
<p>馬尼刺為菲律賓首都、住有華僑　萬餘人、（全菲律賓羣島有十萬餘人）多携眷南來、有及學兒童五千餘人、使盡入菲校肄業、則我華僑有納稅義務、自然有享受敎育權利、然將來兒童長大後、必失却民族性、設自立學校照內地小學設施、則有環境與生活技能關係、又不能事事遵照部章、因此華僑教育、成為重大題、近南京僑務委員會派該會委員李樸生、及敎育部考察專員方蒸雲兩君、到南洋各屬視察敎育、先至馬尼刺、茲將馬尼刺華僑教育述其概况如下、亦關心海外僑務者、所願　焉、</p>
<p>（一）學校萌芽時代</p>
<p>常美國初管領菲島時、首任領事陳紫衍、（其父陳謙善為西領時代甲必丹、登廢淸光緒戊戍科進士第、派為駐菲首任領事、）就原有甲必丹衙署、創設畢校、卽現在南洋各屬歷史最久學生數最多（日夜課一千二百餘人）之中西學校、未幾甲必丹衙署為美政府所收管、附設於華僑善舉公所內、當時我國并未頒小學章程、視為一種慈善事業、經費由善舉公所撥充、雖亦兼授英文、學生數　三四十人、不過為創設時代具一種學校雛形、至辛亥春始脫離善舉公所獨立、民國紀元後、一方面見菲人自經美人統治、敎育進步、一日千里、民智日開、一方面華僑携眷南來日多、而及學兒童年有增加、因此民國三年、此地成立華僑敎育會、抽收營業附捐（辦法見後）為常費、在馬僑校逐年增加、州府各埠、亦各相繼成立學校、各就地方妥籌經費、并且多數自建校舍、惜各處僑胞、或因黨派意見過深、對公共敎育事業、不能為整個計劃、共謀發展、不然常不僅保持現狀已也、</p>
<p>（二）華僑敎育會過去與現在　該會成立於民</p>
<p>三年間首冠以菲律賓三字、其實範圍袛及馬尼刺、其目的為擴充華僑敎育、（時馬尼刺祗有中西學校）故提議抽收營業附捐、以充敎育常費、華商歡然贊同、蓋居留地政府稅則、凡商人售出一百元、須納政府營業稅一元五角、同時加納四仙半、為華僑敎育常費、每三個月一季、由釐務局連帶鳩收、此為任何商店告負擔得到、當極盛時每年收入十餘萬元、而敎育會所管學校有中學一、女學一、普通小學六、日夜課學生二于餘人、但營業附捐、屬於志願的、非有立法根據、近來馬尼刺僑校經費日形支絀、逼不得已為併校之舉、（卽祗存中學一小學　女學一）卽田附捐逐年遞减，　遞减原因、不外（一）意氣用事、（二）商况不佳、（三）相率效允、致現年收人不得五六千元、而敎育會擔任此校經費、惟有臨時籌欵、維持現狀耳、</p>
<p>（三）敎育會與管轄下各校關係</p>
<p>英荷各屬僑校、內部常自起排擠、卽學校用人之權、操自校董、職敎員各有背景、校長無統轄全校之權、因此時鬧風潮、若馬尼刺敎育會、祗聘　校長、校內一切職敎員、由校長推薦、董事不干涉校內行政、故敎育界位置得以安定、任職　年以上者過半數、校長有繼續任職廿年以上者、此固非童事會放棄責任、蓋信任校長故也、因此轉引起輿論界之反響、指為　閥當權、敎育會大權旁落、徒任轄下四校籌經費之責、記者固站在校方、誠不敢强為判斷是非也、</p>
<p>（四）馬埠僑校特別發達</p>
<p>敎育會經費旣如此支組，而　年來華僑小學、竟如雨後春筍、特別發達、現就學校單位言、共有廿三校、或則數　人、或則一二百人、最多者近三百人、（敎育會轄下四校除外、）其原因各校舊職敎員、多有感情關係、未便隨便撤換、致後來者無缺可補、而且閩南大學高中畢業生、多數以南洋為出路、所有技能、又不適合商塲環境、羣趨於敎育　途、粥少僧多、自不得不另立門戶、以支持生計、揣測如是、雖部中不遠矣、</p>
<p>（五）各僑校英漢課程分配</p>
<p>查敎育部所須小學課程標準、無外國語一科、海外僑校、　適應生活環境、則准自小學第五年起授外國語、馬埠中中西普智二小學、為僑校中學生最多、歷史最久者、則上午專授漢文、下午專授英文、每來祖國敎育家許多責難、但欲解釋　漢文分上下敎授原因、不得不從環境　係說起、菲人自受美國啟發、英語已道行無阻、華僑大小商家、多直接與外人交易、買賣單據、舟車儎宇種種、皆鼐英文、近更推行簿記律、　在商塲中任書記、更須英漢文稍有根底、各僑校自小學第三年起卽漢英文兼授、豫計初中畢業、英文司讀至第七年級、凡商店中所有簿記、打字、出人口往來單據、稍事訓練、便可應付自如、非如來自內地初中畢業生、一到此地商塲、百般須從頭學起因此不慣商塲生活多擠往敎育界一路者、在廿年前僑校課程、英文列為隨意科、卽照部章自第五年起、每週加人幾點鐘者、多數商家以學非所用、多送子弟往菲校肆業、相衡并論、現僑校雖不全注重漢文、不勝於送往菲校全讀外國文乎、</p>
<p>以上所談、為菲律賓首都馬尼刺華僑敎育情形、至辦理成績如何、李方二專員回國後、自有一番詳細報告也、</p>

<p>新海參據外洋來訊、今庚各產地收獲、均甚歉缺、東洋十番八甲朝鮮玲刺花色雖出新已久、但來源極少、西洋各貨尚未到過、本街陳貨、因遲日川漢湘晋等帮、去胃健旺、所以日見减少、花色亦殘缺不齊、行號售價因此一致提漲、昨日行盤賣出四六支金山紅底靴參價二百五十五元、八支二百二十八元、四六支望加錫冲紅底靴二百四十元、貨品較遜者一百八十元、八支一百六十六元、十二支一百五十五元、十四支一百四十四元、十六支一百三十六元、四六支北海白底靴一百四十五元、十二支一百二十二元、十二支靑蟲參一百五十八元、十四支一百四十四元、十六支一百三十五元、頂灰岩參一百七十六元、出辦一百六十八元、一號一百五十七元、望出辦梅花參二百二十八元、新十番參、三十五支增卯貨三百十五元、四十二支三百元、五十支二百八十五元、六十支二百七十元、二十五支細皮新八甲參三百四十五元、各貨市面、比較旬前售價、約漲十餘元、至二三十元不等、</p>

<p>昨日糖市趨勢穩定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨及轉口貨、均呌原價、荷赤轉口貨KO六元一角、東白四號升五分、現貨二十一元三角、轉口六元四角、八九號無變動、本廠綿白振記一號二十元四角、二三四五號照退、號盤有廣潮帮開出海南赤三百餘包、十三元八角至九角、比升一角、又綿赤二百五十餘包、其林十五元六角、永盛十五元〇五分、玉記十四元九角、决略减、拋盤有復和裕開出小包東赤八千包、（卽裝）、價為日金五元六角、</p>

<p>新桂圓近以泉州興化安海同安等處、到貨漸湧，號盤步跌不已、昨行方之　莊貨，因亦隨降、聞公會業已議定上中檔須跌七八元、以次稍差、後市如銷胃旺盛、可期暫定、</p>

<p>昨本埠絲市、洋莊靜寂不暢、雖略有絲電轉滬、但均持價不高、華絲商則態度穩定、蓋鑒於內地秋收繅折不佳、劃本或難低落、致巿氣仍入擯持之局、絲價大致難趨降勢、用戶亦因中秋節屆、進胃略呆、昨全市成交一八〇擔、用戶占半云、</p>

<p>皖贛紅茶總運銷處、以現下未沽存茶、僅祇七八千箱、為謀廓淸存底、以期迅速結束紀見、力圖整個推銷、連日該處　經理程振基氏一再召集會議、商議對　、並與英商協和怡和錦隆等洋行、及在裕泰茶店、協議價格、零星交易、現時已在停頓中、至綠茶市面、亦無重大交易、僅針眉珠茶、及高莊抽芯珍眉、略有走銷、價無上落云、</p>
<p>據茶業公會報告云、綠茶市情、頗呈沉悶景象、恐一時難望發展、昨各洋行對抽珍及珍眉因接外洋來電、還價緊　之故、所議之價、均未成交、惟貢熙白頭行進辦尚稱不寂、價與前相仿、及同孚路進十一元珠茶而已、</p>

<p>— 陳因</p>
<p>—五年的創痛—</p>
<p>（序聲）</p>
<p>我悲　地，我已讀到，我已聞到，</p>
<p>我也已能看到，這幾許首的，</p>
<p>充滿着殘暴的悲慄的詩了：</p>
<p>我的素樸的和平的生命之流中，</p>
<p>我不能够容納這些多實不可接近的，</p>
<p>可詛咒的恐怖的一投擊。</p>
<p>我要奮力排擠出它去喲！</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>「街道上，</p>
<p>暴徒橫行：</p>
<p>狂邪的</p>
<p>笑聲充盈；</p>
<p>兇殘的</p>
<p>面目猙獰。</p>
<p>腰上的</p>
<p>佩刀鏗鏘；</p>
<p>槍上的</p>
<p>剌刃白亮。</p>
<p>無數個的</p>
<p>頭顱飛擲；</p>
<p>無數其的</p>
<p>屍身橫陳。</p>
<p>無數羣的</p>
<p>婦女被姦淫；</p>
<p>無數堆的</p>
<p>乳嬰被火焚。</p>
<p>無數箱的</p>
<p>財物被刦掠；</p>
<p>無數個的山嶺·河流·田畝·鄕村·城鎭……都被鯨吞。</p>
<p>雞犬聲不聞，</p>
<p>鳥雀恐驚遁。……</p>
<p>瀋陽城中，</p>
<p>鬼哭神嚎；</p>
<p>瀋陽城上，</p>
<p>太陽旗向太陽投吻。」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這是什麼？—殘暴喲！</p>
<p>這是什麼？—殘暴喲！—</p>
<p>可怖喲，—</p>
<p>「九一八」這個衰烈的巨響。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>殘暴喲，—我不忍讀！</p>
<p>殘暴喲，—我不忍聞！</p>
<p>殘暴喲，—我不忍見！</p>
<p>我要咒詛，—</p>
<p>這不能不是一個恐怖的罪惡的節目！</p>
<p>我要驚呼，—</p>
<p>這不能不是一個恐怖的罪惡的奇蹟！</p>
<p>我要否定其存在！</p>
<p>我要否定其存在！</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>這是誰個惡鬼創造的？</p>
<p>這竟是歷史之神，</p>
<p>把牠故意貼附到和平者之身？</p>
<p>醜惡，—我們要毀滅！</p>
<p>侮辱，—我們怎能忍？</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>我要借助於雨神之口，</p>
<p>來沖洗我們的侮辱！</p>
<p>我要借助於風神之手，</p>
<p>來掃除一切的醜惡！</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>（一個顫慄的强烈的感念，</p>
<p>我被刺痛着這個「九一八」的創痛的課題：</p>
<p>五年的創痛喲！）</p>
<p>（七）五年的創痛喲！……</p>
<p>「但是我們要生存！」</p>
<p>「不願做奴隸的人們喲！」</p>
<p>我們唱句强盛的口號詩吧:</p>
<p>「我們要鬥爭。我們要鬥爭！」</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>當王老太太起身之後，就覺得渾身上下像是丟了一件東西似的，是什麼東西呢，她却說不出，可是在她的身上少了一點物件那却是事實。她極力搜求，極力推敲，打算發覺出其中的道理來，但是，不對，人還是她那副身子，五髒不會因為睡了一夜覺就少下一件去，衣服也穿的和平日一般多，這還有什麼值得再猶豫不決的？說不定是她自己想昏了，人一老，什麼胡塗勾當全會在那副老身子上作怪，自然也就難免發生這樣無中生有的奇異的感覺。</p>
<p>窗裏面已然竄入七月盛夏炎熱的朝陽的光輝，屋子裏這堂堂的。通過光波便有無數的塵末飛揚着，就如碧天之上，翻起來的，陣旋風，不同的是這些塵末永在那裏跳動着，憂親傲然有如　下了根基。當那淸新的空氣飄入屋內時，裏面的霉濕氣便被掩埋過去了，王老太太就沒有因為空氣不調而在乾咳。這一點，她是早就體騐到了，這也就是她特別對於夏天的早晨較之冬天早晨特別表示好感的主因。她常常對同院的鄰居們說：「一到夏天，我就復活了，到冬天，我就病怏怏的不舒服，夏天空氣好啊。」</p>
<p>這時，院子裏兩家鄰也全起來了，孩子們到院心中扒着土，有的拉屎，有的朝着棗樹上瞪起貪婪的眼光來。女人們升着了煤球爐，煤烟像霧般飄上天空，淸新的空氣一下子就染得惡濁了。王老太太按照老例在打掃起屋子裏了，隨後拿起一片破舊的抹布擦拭着窗　　蓋上的灰土，而當她拿起那而相伴四十多年的鏡子擦去鏡面上的灰塵時，她忽然呌了起來，那是一聲驚奇的哭呌，而在表明着事情是出於突然的，就在那時，那一　她親手挑選的鏡子，有了多年歷史的嫁妝品，輕輕的滑出手外落到地下了，緊接着撞出淸脆而又破碎的聲響，鏡子打得粉碎。她楞了一會，直瞪着兩只老眼，高抬起兩雙瘦削的手在呆望着，不知在想些什麼事情，當她一忽身走向西間兒子的住屋時，口裏面就嚷出一片混亂的話語：「啊，鐲子呀……天哪，我的鐲子呀，……孽障東西偷去了麼。……天老爺不答應。……我要鐲子……」</p>
<p>西屋裏空空的，沒有兒子的影子，兒子哪裏去了？往常他要睡到太陽大高的，為什麼今天比她早起逕自去了？她原想問問兒子看沒有看見她的鐲子，這一來，她簡直完全明白了，事實的眞象；她生氣，她痛心，跳脚捶胸的鬧了一陣，甚而朝着兒子睡覺的空因素打了好幾把掌，好像這樣才解恨似的就哭起來了。毫無問題，昨夜好她睡覺時兒子從她的胳膊上拉了下去，他這時早不知變賣多久又蹲在白面房子裏去過着大　。這一副鐲子，王老太太異常重視，雖然　不見得怎樣值錢，因為也是陪嫁的物品，且將來人埋土內也想帶進去，存了這樣一個心思，她所以把鐲子看成了她的第二生命。只為自己的兒子占染了惡習，不知偷了她多少東西，換了錢，就去抽白面；她的老伴死得早，眼看守着成人的兒子給與她諸種失望處，她早就把日後對他的希望取消，不想借重他的供養，而預備自了殘生了。兒子長大，就不是自己的兒子了，媽媽空說多少好話，勸諫，激動，責駡全沒有用處，她灰心之後，就另外佔據了一個營壘把兒子當成了敵人時時在戒備着他不呌他近前，積極方面的管束她旣然沒有力量，就只有從消極方面想出這種抵制的方法。就這樣，兒子還常常抓到一種意想不到的機會中就俞了她認為保守嚴密的物品。兒子眞不是好兒子，兒子太使他的媽媽傷心，兒子讓邪物迷了一經……</p>
<p>鄰居們一聽到王老太太的哭聲，十成有群居民猜到了又是發生了什麼事情，張太太，李太太還有幾個孩子都跑過來探動靜，她們洞悉之後，就在解勸着，請老太太息怒，她們還以身作則的說：「不是你的兒子還偷過我們的東西麼。」可是今天的王老太太不服勸，依然哭，依然拍着胸脯跳着脚，一面喊着：「這就一點首飾了，孽種，偷去了媽媽的心，天老爺不能容情啊，天老爺打雷劈死他罷。」這時，她有如想到了辦法，一溜烟的鼻涕一把淚一把的跑出大門，只聽她口不連聲重念着：「我去找那孽種，我找他去算賬，我找他去算賬，說說道理，找個地方去講講道理。」</p>
<p>當王老太太跑到白面房子門口時，後面張太太和李太太也跟上來，她們純然是不放心老太太的這種意外的舉動，生怕因此急出別種不幸的事情——上了年歲的人，死就如影子似的跟上身，一有合宜機會就把老者的性命捉了去，她們顧及到這一層，就寗願放下自己的家事而來甘盡義務照顧着這位老鄰居了。王老太太跑到門口停下脚，門敞開着，窗子敞開着，兒子正坐在屋子裏抽白面，看見她動也未動，只顧和XX人談閒話，她闖進去了，好喊道：「小全，你還我鐲子，你這死不了的孽鬼，你快出來！……」還未等她喊完，XX人的把掌打到她的瘦　的左腮上，她只覺眼前一陣發花，就跑出門外來了。但她立刻就回復過精神來，她要找出兒子說理，她還要管XX人問罪，就風一陣的跑到分所裏去。</p>
<p>「老……總，」她口吃而又是上氣不接下氣地說道，「我……兒子……抽白面……我到白……面房……房子找……XX人打我……全是不……不講天理……老總……你們替……替……替我……出出還這一口氣……」她說不下去了，人有如一團棉花，一下子就癱到凳子上去</p>
<p>當老總說明他們的職權不能行使到白面房子，不能到XX人家去辦案時，王老太太是何等氣氛！這可呌作什麼話！豈是老總們應該說出口的麼！老總們不管這些事，可是應該哪個人來管？……</p>
<p>時候已經到了九點鍾，當天王老太太剛想駁責老總不合理的話語時，忽然讓門外的　鼓響聲阻住，而在這時，讓她望見那一隊XX眼藥的遊街廣告隊中，就有他的兒子在內，她樂得直如開了一扇亮門，就呌起來：「老總，這回好了，我兒子就在那人羣裏面。穿綠衣服的，腦袋上載上頂三尖帽，手拿招牌的，這回抓來罷。」</p>
<p>「這回也不行，雖然在街面，因為有XX人在內主使啊，那隊全是白面犯，可就不能下手，你去拿就引起來交涉，這可萬萬辦不得」！老總勸說起來了，「老太太，總是你自己的兒子，明天回家好好勸說勸說就行了</p>
<p>「這不是沒有王法了麼？唉！我的天……」她伸起手　　　　的左腮，眼望着過去的花花錄錄的廣告隊又哭起來了。</p>

<p>— 山</p>
<p>在雜沓的足音與白色的手帕揮舞中，離開了半天染得血紅的夜的東京。</p>
<p>車裏遇到友人黑田君。他是漢文學部裏的學生，專攻中國現代文學的人；在寂寞的車中，遇到了異國的友人時，總也能有一種懷懸之情，更何況在深夜的車中食堂裏，飮着啤酒，談着其深愛的詩和其二重的生活。</p>
<p>在異國的生活裏，最能感觸到的，是自己的可憐和孤弱，正似剛離了母巢的　燕，一面依戀着故舊的樑的巢，而一面却厭棄了這平凡的生活，而雄圖着其他的一切。</p>
<p>但同時我們却也能看到感到這强橫的鄰男人的可鄰而渺小的生活——二重性生活；我從這個知識階級的黑田君身心上，尤能澈心地感覺到。</p>
<p>黑田君深憎着戰爭，而時常地空想着平和的生活，或許由於他過分的受過才　　敎育的　害，還小　進到了對戰爭的充分認識，然而在這樣的時世和情勢之下，能厭憎戰爭，已是令自己稱心和愉快的了。</p>
<p>然而所謂國家的　　生活，常常抹煞了人的個性和自由，黑田君　棄了這署期的研究生活，到繁殖着松樹的故　四國去，這乃是被犧牲於非常時的召集令的。</p>
<p>事於戰爭的模倣，而却非從專於戰兒的模倣與準備不可的時候，那種矛盾的抹煞了自己的生活，乃常是構成了悲劇的基礎。</p>
<p>黑由君卽是在這悲劇的　上，演着這　的一幕，在旁人看來，這或許是種有趣而且富於變化性的趣劇，而在我深知二　章性生活的　味之人看來：則黑田君的心　恐怕掩覆着夏天般憂　的雲吧！</p>
<p>「期日是短的，但　　似兒戲的生活，於我是厭憎之極的！」黑田君深呷了口啤酒嘆息說。</p>
<p>「唉！這正是統制制度的恩賜呢？像這種斯巴達工的生活復活時我們正祈望給自己個性自由的雅典式的自由制度」</p>
<p>窗外的夜幕，掩覆了所有的田野與山崗的景色，唯有車輪音驚破了宇宙靜寂。</p>
<p>第二天，黑田君在大阪驛，我回首看到呆立在月台上的他的姿態時，在他的健康的兩肩上，宛如堆積着無限的　影與悲哀。</p>

<p>— 隅</p>
<p>也算是紀念</p>
<p>最好是「面壁」三年，或者「坐關」十載，那末也許血可以冷了，知覺可以麻木了，卽是不能做成一個與世無爭的高僧，至少也能做成一個唾面自乾的聖人之徒。舉起筆桿，可以一五一十的「畫諾」，放下筆桿，可以規規矩矩地做個良民。把社會剝盡了牠的物的條件，那末所存的只是人為的是非，而所謂良民者，就是住在那個社會中而沒有是非之謂。說「是」，則應之曰「是」；「非」，則應是曰「非」；如果口是而心非，那末還是「　　」末深，「坐關」未足，做盛世遺民，恐還有不够的地方。必須怎樣才可以呢？並沒有怎樣特定的標準。能如老莊之道，更進步忘了是非，拿別人的是非當是非，而自已的是非不在裏面，也許就可以。然而你得睡到半夜，澈底地想過一想，你能不能辦到呢？能？還是不能？這中間並沒有還價，你如果要還價，這就是「生意經」。然而像我們這樣米氣未脫。自己認為像熱有介事的人，就對於執掌「神聖的是」的人不是「生意經」。這不是「生意經」的解說，就是旣把你與「娼　並蓄」，而你要自視高出於娼優之上，或者天下已無用「舌」的必要，而你還要回去問一問老婆，張開你的嘴巴，鄭重地呌她看看你的舌頭是否還存在。或者看看你的手是否像「孔乙已」一樣被打斷，或者你的頸項上的繩子是否還能繼續寫下去一提到那　老筆桿，你就像「呌化子」提到他的棒一樣，一團火樣的高興可是你寫，你得同時考量「睦鄰政策」，你得考量「一年二月」等，你願意像那位希蠟神話中的海王之子「柏魯脫斯」一樣，他具備着先見之明，同時也有變　形相的這樣法力。你有這樣法力，你可以把你的舌頭隨着客觀的形勢而掉動，你也可以把你的相貌，隨着客觀的形勢而變換。這就成了。辦得到麼？辦不到，還是免　尊口，或者「談幽默」吧，或者「說鬼狐」吧。或者「吃苦茶」吧，或者「洗海水浴吧」，或者「說今天天氣好吧」，或者「裝死吧」。然而今天剛巧是這末一個日子，這倒是一個難於解決的「疙瘩」。於是　想到「桃花　」傳奇中那位老道士張瑤星在追悼　　皇帝的道場中，對一對痴男女侯方城李香君講的話：「國在那裏，家在那裏」，我們現在如　些基督敎所謂：蒙上帝的保佑，雖尙有家有國，但三千萬的人已無家無國。談幽默麼？「吃苦茶」麼？「上火山」麼？「洗海水澡」麼？「說今天天氣好」麼？「裝死」麼？都有些不像樣。那末請問又怎末辦呢？這些都暫且慢　點去回答。提起了「桃花　」，使　想起了那位說書的柳敬亭。那末到了評委會日子…………這個日子，讓我乘權充說書人，而把你們權充　衆吧。我來　拾舊事，而由你們加以批評。可是我無柳敬亭那樣天才。自然沒有　麻子那樣說得生動。同時我的　拾舊事，並不是作為慨嘆的資料，而是想從　舊事的本身，找出些可為討論的資料，來針對現實。然而把歷史從側而切斷。牠將成為一段段死的事實，而這事實的解說，也可以因人的立場不同，解說各異，但歷史自身的演進，會否定一切武斷的解說的。我現在球是討論歷史眞實的問題，這樣的大道理我固討論不來，你們也聽不進去，我得還是　充說書人，盡說書人應盡的本分吧。</p>
<p>不久以前，我記得上海那一家舊戲院曾演「明末亡國恨」我對於京劇無緣，我沒有膽　去看那大鴨大鼓震得「天翻地覆」的場面。可是我在幾個月以前，却到了那「明末亡國恨」歷史演出所在地的「煤山」支過兩次。那場面中的主角「明患宗」雖早已被埋在十三陸的一角，而煤山之上的所排列在一條綫上的五所亭子，也因為北平市政府整頓市容的原故，剛在修漆一新，那種畫桷繍棟的富麗的顏色也許正如上海舞臺上的艷麗的佈景一樣，使你走入那樣　境，看了那樣場面，而如果又沒有老北平引導，或者沒有受過六年以上的敎育，連　樣一段歷史也不知道，或者甚至沒有上海人的眼福，有機會看到這演出的「遺恨」，再或者身臨其境而沒有看了北平指南等　　書，你決不會相信這地方曾為那定於悲劇意　的一代帝王的絕命的場所。然而我却有先入為主的一幕情節在我的胸中，我走進了往煤山去的大門，我就聯想到那歷史的片斷，而在我的心中，也早有一幕悲慘的場面存在，所以當我走上那通達山上的石級，而看到那兩帝一帶白皮松林。牠們幹枝的灰白色，覺　慘澹得可怕，似乎永遠紀念着這亡國的遺　：在下面那一棵思宗在牠旁枝上吊死的「罪槐」，牠那不勝　罪的重負而中空分裂為兩載的老幹，和那被灰　所染而成憔悴顏色的要葉，和那圍在外面的帶着莊嚴面目黑色短　，以及在牆外白石朱畫　明思　殉國處」的碑，也都足以把我的注意力，從那現實的　　場面吸引至那歷史悲裏的演劇場面。「明思宗」一直到現在，還能活躍於人們的心中，大槪就因為他是悲劇中的人物，可是我現在並沒有像前淸那些「考相公」一樣，鑽進狗棚式的「考場」來被逼而作「明思宗」的策論，我無庸來評論這位末代帝王的好壞。我覺得他的慘烈的死，就他個人講，像個漢了，這就已够，這一點已高出於宋朝徴欽二宗以上政治上的失敗，並不算什麼。他如果生在現代，也許可以坐了飛機，逃出北平，而不至遭受那樣的悲慘的命運。也許能如末遺老黃宗義先生「明夷待訪錄」中所冀望的一樣，他可以像唐朝「安綠山之禍，玄宗幸蜀，吐蕃之禍，代宗幸陜，朱泚之亂，德宗幸奉天」，後來終達恢復的目的。所以他認為明代之亡，由於建都北平的失算。講到這問題，剛巧與現代有些人認為如果國民政府的都城不在南京，而仍在北平，華北的局面，或不致如此的意見相反。講到這裏，我又要像那會變形的「柏魯脫斯」樣，來冒充一個政論家，來把是非得失評論一下，自然我的這些見識，是不值那些高明的政論家笑。可是至少也代表我的一點意見。得啦，還都而避其鋒，徐圖恢復，那也是理所應當的。拿別國來做例子，新土耳其不都君士坦丁而遷都安哥啦，新俄不都彼得　而遷都莫斯科，這目的無他，就因那時　兩個地方與帝國主義勢力太近，而易遭其包圍，所以這兩個國家的領袖遷都內地，免得外來的勢力深深打擊他們新興的革命勢力。但同時我們不要忘記，這兩個國家的政權能够穩定，帝國主義的勢力能够打退，是在這兩個國家民衆以後幾年的血戰，並不是遷了都，逃避了外人勢力的壓迫就能解除束縛。如果沒有幾年的奮鬥，我相信列寗托洛斯基，不是上了斷頭臺，就做了堪察加的終身囚徒，那裏還有新俄，那裏還有什麼五年計劃的建設，而凱末爾也必定像摩洛哥里夫酋長阿白特爾克林（Abc-el-Krim）一樣，彼希臘人囚於某個荒島上了，那裏還有什麼新土耳其。所以那些機械　的人，認為建都在北平，用不着武力抵抗，卽能保全華北領土的人，說句不敬的話，眞有些像白日見鬼。北平雖襟山帶河，有居旗之險，可是因為牠的經濟上的貧弱，及辛丑條約的束縛，以及東北鐵路綱在外人控制之下，軍艦可以朝發夕至，軍隊可以幾日之內，運進山海關，明英宗的「狩於工木」，武宗的「困於陽和」，固不必講，淸代有兩次被外人攻陷，到了目前，東三省失，　察北六縣失，冀東偽自治區成，天津外國駐軍擴大，將近建都一千年的古城，四年前許多國內名流學者所欲藉外人的慈悲，關　所謂「文化城」，今已孤縣絕地，如一個僅存的果子一樣，在人把握之中，只須一舉手，就會被摘下來，還談什麼「金城湯池」之固。且就歷史上的前例講，失去了虛龍，河北就是一片原，簡直無險可守。不過讀者不要誤會，我的意思並不是講，我們甘心放棄了領土，我的意思是講，我們應該進一步恢復我們的失土，使我們有險可守。目前的問題，並沒有討價還價，而只有生死存亡。你們看，不斷喪失的是土地，滔滔不絕提出的是條件，東起鴨綠江，西至陰山，那兒有一片乾淨土。中華民族的大衆，請不要忘記了民族的危機，請不要忘記了過去歷史，那健兒不久曾經染血的喜峯口，我們邊塞詩人曾經歌詠「邊麗滿北漢，虜騎正南驅」。那形勢險要的居庸關，我們的詩人也曾歌詠過「漢家能用兵，開擴窮異城。」那生前富有戲劇性而死後尙留一坯土的昭君墓，我們偉大的寫實詩人也曾歌詠過「一去紫臺連朔漢，獨留靑塚向黃昏。」時間與空間，人物與事實交織而成的史實，都是我們驅土的標幟，怎樣把來喪失的想出保存　辦法，而已喪失的想出恢復的辦法，這都是每一個中國人民應該努力的呀。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>我們都知道人為萬物之靈。這個靈機究屬在什麼地方？據近世學者之證明。我們的靈機是在頭殼內之腦上。現在似乎已成為常識。都知道腦為人身之主宰—是思想志的策源地。</p>
<p>腦的專職。是主持全身精神之分配。由腦分出之神經。繼繞週身。凡毛髮之徴。以及腑臟各處：皆有神經與腦相連絡：作傳達之路線。</p>
<p>腦之管理人體各部分的動作。如政府之管理各地方。凡耳能司聽。目能司視。舌能辦味。肺司呼吸。心司循環。胃腸司消化。以及四肢百骸之動作。無一不受指揮。故腦為全身神經系之中心。—不啻一完備政治之組織。</p>
<p>腦力充足之人。則精神活潑。思想靈敏。無論作何事業。皆易成功—獲到勝利。倘是腦力薄弱之人。則思想遲鈍。行動滯緩。百事無成。試舉美國陶德敎授研究人之腦量的報告。並說：腦量高的人。皆聰敏富貴。腦量低的人。多窮苦無才。由此可知腦量與知力之關係。甚為重要。</p>
<p>腦力衰弱之症狀。為精神疲憊。意志薄弱記憶力衰退。頭量目眩。腦虛頭痛。睡不安枕。病人思想易趨悲觀。茍人生稍不舒逸。往往自殺之慘劇發生。況此病弱之身。勉力從事。其能免隕越已屬大幸。何來成大事業之希望哉？</p>
<p>腦筋衰弱的原因雖多。但總是由於腦部缺乏營養所致。所以本症治療上。補腦是屬於重要之一端。這種補腦藥。在市上尙無專門製劑。雖然那此補藥的種類繁多。但其能適於補腦的。可謂絕無—僅有『米美爾補腦法』Memo　RY　NEUROTIC名符其實。報後確有特異之效果可見。在末服以前。所有頭重頭痛。健忘失眠。精神不快。思想遲鈍等象。即如白雪之見陽春。迅而消失。頓覺頭腦淸爽。思想靈敏。精神愉快。體力健壯。所以這種補腦劑。已得到全球的醫師推獎。為保健頭腦之利器。</p>

<p>肺癆旣因癆菌傳染而生。故治法當以殺菌為主。惜乎近世醫藥進步雖速。而對於直接人肺殺滅癆菌（結核菌）之特效藥尙未發明。市上所售各種肺病藥石。類皆為止咳除痰健胃消化等之作用。幷不能直接殺菌也。</p>
<p>肺病治愈之生理解剖現象。為肺中結核受損之處。被人體細胞組織包圍。結成疤痕。於是各種病象皆退。而復康健。故人生之生理機能旺盛者。細胞即能增殖包圍病部。結成疤痕而愈。　惟肺病患者因久困於病體。生理機能大都現衰萎狀態。此時欲使結核治愈。則惟藉人力以補助之。</p>
<p>據多數學者之研究。如欲促進生理之機能旺盛。惟以補給臟器療法始有大效。其他無論任何化學藥劑。效力微薄。皆不及臟器製劑之可靠。此種最全理而有實效之臟器製劑首推德國出品之「肺活」Phith　Weail藥。</p>
<p>按『肺活』Phith　Weal係據上述治愈肺病之原理。採用壯健動物新鮮肺與脾兩臟器中抽出之內分泌（即荷爾蒙）混合製成。其效能旺盛生理機能使已衰退之組織復活。促進細胞增生。塡補病部之缺損。包圍結核。催促疤痕之形成。如此於病部周圍攻。因此失其活動。終至完全消滅。疾病痊愈。是以「肺活」為治療肺病確有根據最為合理而切實有效之製劑也。</p>

<p>— 陸志祥醫師</p>
<p>淋病能否斷根這句話。凡是正式的醫生恐怕誰都不能回答得出。因淋病為花柳病中最難醫治的疾患。他的毒害。雖和梅　毒堪稱伯仲。而頑强則過之。梅毒雖惡。然醫治得宜。全愈不難。只有淋濁一症。一經傳染。很難有根治的希望。且往往時愈時發。遣累終身的。很多很多。加之他的疾患。不僅限於局部。更會發生種種可怖的續發症或合併症。使人陷於痛苦萬分的地位。至於絕嗣滅種。更是常有的事。可惜世人對於這病。都漫不經心。不知他的禍害。有時還要比梅毒來得利害呢。治療的方法。雖然有電療注射洗滌等等。不過病家往往因為時間經濟和顏面等種種關人係。常不願延醫療治。而且這等療法也往往不能有確實的效騐。所以不論患者或醫家總以淋濁能否斷根這個問題。橫梗在心中。就是我也如此。直到不久的以前偶然發現一種治淋新藥「九一八白濁片」"918"Anti-Gono-Tab而能解決白濁斷根的問題。余曾將「九一八白濁片」"918"　Anti-Gono-Tab歷試於急慢性淋病的患者。竟使淋濁能否斷根的問題。得有圓滿的答覆。他的功效能使十個淋病患者使用「九一八白濁片」經過相當時斯的內服後。竟有七八個得　斷根的結果。即經久或過勞後。亦不復發。從此這可惡的淋病。却有內服自療的斷根楷了</p>

<p>哮喘病。俗有氣喘痰喘等名稱。至其原因。雖學說甚多。莫衷一是。大槪起於慢性支氣管炎·心臟病·慢性腎臟炎等病。此外尙有神經性性氣喘者。亦甚多耳。</p>
<p>哮喘之療法。從前因無完美之藥物。故世人皆認為難得根治之症。即臨床醫家。對於本病。亦感棘手。祇於發作時。藉麻醉劑（嗎啡鴉片）暫時緩解其痛苦而已。欲其痊愈不發。總屬困難無望。惜此等麻醉劑不宜常用。恐有中毒之處耳。市間販賣之氣喘藥。其成分中因含有麻醉劑。雖能立刻生效。但若每發必用。則往往有成續之弊。病家如購服此類含有毒質之氣喘藥。非但不能根治。且往往能貽中毒之巨害。可一慎之哉。</p>
<p>茲有德國DR.HUMBERTM.D.亭皮耳胖子醫學博士根據多年經騐異最新學理。採用壯健動物之內分泌素配製。發明一氣喘根治藥。其名「哮立平」Holipin係一種內服片劑。藥內不含絲毫毒質。雖功效偉大。但無任何副作用。專治老幼各種氣喘。呼吸困難而發生之氣喘。或因枯草熱而發生之氣順。總之不論原困何在。不論新起久病。無不奏效如神。如氣喘爆發極險劇之時服之。可立刻見效有起死回生之功。欲施行根本治療者。應於平日連續服用「哮立平」二至三月。大抵均可根本痊癒。永無再復之苦。如與肺結核·肺氣腫·肺萎等症同時發生者。除服用（哮立平）之外。　兼服「肺活」JPHITH　WRAL一葉。則兩效相得益彰。治僡期間。更見迅速矣。</p>

<p>世界日進文明。則女子之交際愈廣。而職業生活及外界　戟。隨之增多。於是精神體力之消耗亦日甚。故女子之攝生。自當格外講求矣。</p>
<p>女子於月經來潮時。精神過勞。易致身體衰弱。生殖器之發育。亦被障碍。故職業婦女多患月經困難（即痛經）與女性的神經衰弱（又名希司的里·或憂　症）的病。是以於衛生之道。不可不注意也。</p>
<p>一旦發現月經不調（經期不正確·經量過多或過少·月經困難·月經閉止等）。身體衰弱。萎黃貧血。腰酸頭痛。四肢乏力。精神衰頹。性情異常（喜怒哀樂無常）食慾不振。夜間失眠。茶葉蛋惡　顛倒。心跳。虛汗。形容憔悴等。上述皆為婦女常有之病態也。必須注意修養。幷施以適當之治療。方可早復健康。若遷延不治。或治之不當。終至精神困憊。身體　瘦。多染癆症而亡。如此對於月經之衛生。及病者之療養。不可不充分慮及之也。</p>
<p>近月有婦女保健劑『美奴寗』Menorrin一葉。對於女性之衰弱月經不調諸症。有特之異功效。凡經停。痛經。經期超前落後。經血過多過少。一切婦科經病。均可調理正常。故『美奴寗』有補血調經溫宮種子之奇效。</p>
<p>『美奴寗』更論婦女勞傷。肝氣哎逆骨蒸盧熱。乾血癆瘵。亦白帶下。曾經小產而瘀血在小腹不去者。崩漏。腰酸新月。痛　不眠。久不受孕。以及胎前產後諸症。亦有確效。且本品有補血强壯之功。凡氣血虧損之婦女。服用『美奴寗』Menorrin後。可使　弱為强元氣倍增。精神愉快。體力活躍。尤</p>
<h3 id="c207">慢性下痢之危險 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 徐生章醫師</p>
<p>慢性下痢之原因。槪為腸結核（腸癆），赤白痢疾，食物中毒與及慢性腸等而起。其通常之症狀為腹瀉。一日有二三次至七八次之下痢。且時輕時重。每發腹痛，鼓腸雷鳴。腹部幷有壓重之感。大便混有粘液。或膿汁。或血液。患者因食物人腹。不易消化吸收。故漸次貧血痢瘦·頭痛·心跳·精神萎靡·虛弱不堪，若放任不治。或醫治不當。往往能發生虛脫而死本病這攝養及治療法。患者須食易消化而富有滋養料之食物。幷禁過飽。腹部不宜受冷。起居應有規則。治療之藥物。其最有效果者。首推「翻雲痢」藥片DYSETRIN　TAB.本品服至腸管內。力能防腐府殺菌。如腸管內。力能防腐發生潰瘍者。服用「敵腸痢」可催長新生組織。以保持其生活現象。對於下痢。有天然收歛止演之功效。同時幷調整胃腸　生理機能。興奮食慾。補助消化。又有增進榮養之效益。故全球醫師均認「敵腸痢」為胃腸保健之聖劑。即是故耳。且本品毫無毒性。對於人體絕無妨害。不論老人或小兒。皆宜用之。</p>
<p>注意—腸癆（又名腸結核）之下痢。多為理症肺癆之併發症。其療法除服用『敵腸痢』櫐片外。須用療肺專劑之『肺活』Phith　Weal同時內服。則收效尤顯。而治愈更速。</p>
<h3 id="c208">母乳缺乏　原固及補救 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 柏秀貞女士</p>
<p>母乳缺乏。大抵因母體之螢養不良。或精神感受異常之　戟而起　　孕婦分娩　後。卽應負哺乳嬰兒　責任。故產後設乳汁缺乏。或全無。皆兒之大幸也乳汁缺乏之補救。母體宜常保養身心。催乳劑可服用臟器製劑之『媽媽多』Mammato使乳腺機能亢進。分泌旺盛。且能增加乳汁中營養之成分。哺育嬰兒。更令肥健活躍。對發育亦頗迅速。</p>
<p>倘母體衰弱異常。氣血虧損極甚者。可服用『美奴寗』Menorrin一藥。有補血調理衰弱之特效。且能通經活血。防止早老。增加健美。歐美靑年婦女。類多以此為調經保健之實物耳。</p>

<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>九一八，這血的紀念日，今天是五週年了，這五年中，我們的國家成了怎樣一副面目？我們已用不到多說，鐵樣的事實都陳列在面前；在這慘痛的紀念日，我的感情太衝動，簡直想不出用怎樣的字眼纔能表現出我想說的話，（我想除了甘願為奴隸的為虎作倀的漢奸之外每個同胞都有這樣的感覺！）再說，這一筆血賬，也决計不是逢到紀念日才把它記起來就能兩訖的。「冬天吃冷水，滴滴記在心」，我們平時决记不会把「冷水」忘掉，而在这惨痛的纪念日，它祇是更喚起了我們「吃冷水」時的情境，而慚愧地想到；哦，已经是足足的五年了！</p>
<p>在這五年後的今日，我不想多說什麽，我祗是想對同胞們提出一個警告：最大的「恥辱」，（「恥辱」這雨個字有些不切常，因為實際上這是我們每個人的「生存」問題，而不是這麽一個抽象的槪念的名詞就能了的。）我們已「忍辱負重」的「忍耐」了五年了，五年來的「恥辱」，不僅沒有减輕，並且在加重下去，所以，現在問題的重心已不在怎樣洗去過去的「恥辱」，而在怎樣制止恥辱」的加重，固然，我們知道而且相信，這是二而一的問題，並不是單獨解决就能作為解决的。</p>
<p>為了這樣，我這裏祇想抄一點近日的報在下面，讓我們看看五年後的今日，已是怎樣的一副局面，而它又將會怎樣發展下去。</p>
<p>日陸軍拓務農林各省及「滿洲國」協和會滿洲移民協會等，為紀念九一八五週年，並鼓勵人民移殖滿洲，特由昨日開始至十八日止舉行盛大之移民立傳週：在全國各地召開移民講演會。由陣軍省參謀本部及農林拓務大藏各省並對滿事務局滿鐵會社等派員組織講演班十班，巡回講演，同時並舉行九十八事變電影演映會，及九一八座談會，以鼓吹　武思想，激勵人民向外侵略，現各地之在鄉軍人會·靑年團·國防婦人會，亦均積極活動宣傳。（十一日東京電）</p>
<p>日方當局紀念九一八，侵佔我國東北五週年，特定於該日在大連市舉行各校學生野外演習總動員，參加者約有三千五百餘人，由當日午前五時三十分開始，八東西兩軍，以中國為假想敵，表演壯烈之拂　戰。（十四日大連電）</p>
<p>這是關於「紀念的，我們已可以看出多少的不同來了。這樣的東丟開不談。我們再來看看人家是怎樣「提携着我們，來作為太文的結束吧。—</p>
<p>十三日晚有種某國旗我重汽車小輛，滿載棉紗，上有某國人數名　行，　　保公路　　　日本紡績業，最近在天津積極擴張營業，前有鐘淵紡續公司買收裕元華新兩紗廠，東洋紗廠買收裕豐，改修工廠內容，擴充事業，今次上海紡績公司亦有北進計劃……與中國方面交涉之結果，决定購入土地七萬坪，……聞自明年春　起，趕造工廠，年底可告竣。（十五日天津電）</p>
<p>日人視察華北者，最近激增，從來多係個人單獨赴華，近來則組織團體，尤其各地商工會議所派遺之視察團最多……（十五日天津電）</p>
<p>最後，我不得不再加上一句贅言，那就是為了篇幅關係，上面所剪的電訊，袛是很簡略的在報上所見到的一些，其他的，我想請讀者們自己去看去，好在是觸目皆是。並且，在上面這一些中，我們實在也足以「可見一斑」的了。</p>

<p>— 舍利</p>
<p>可是爸爸也沒見過小東西的臉廳兒啊！</p>
<p>很早，他打了這個主意：——</p>
<p>弄點錢，拍張相片，寄到遙遠的家裏去吧！</p>
<p>到今兒他這主意還沒有兌現，這使他非常痛苦。他是在一個印度老闆開設的印子錢公司裏邊，當一個跑腿的小職員。那家債戶的日期到了，沒有冬夏，沒有遠近，他得跑到那家去收賬，有時候跑回來，兩條腿酸麻得像不是自家兒的一樣。太累嗎？一整年的薪金才只三十塊。</p>
<p>三十塊，自家得添補鞋襪，又要寄家用，那裏會還有綫拍相片？</p>
<p>他愁得更老了啦！</p>
<p>一蹩扭，他就來找我，拉開話匣子，板的，老是那一套：他的故鄕怎麽好，他的老婆兒怎麽聽從他的話，他沒有錢拍相片，他昨兒晚上又夢見那小東西了……</p>
<p>也許在背完了那一套之後，就吚唔着哼起秦腔來。</p>
<p>可是這些日子來，他好久不唱秦腔了。人更瘦得利害，臉色，就像黃梅時節的天空，陰沉沉地。並且述話也不大說了，把那張嘴老閉着。</p>
<p>我眞担心他會病倒下來。</p>
<p>—伙計！我跟你說，大槪我是行老運了，昨兒老闆突然把我喊了去，你猜，是什麼事？</p>
<p>前天，他到我這裏來，臉色明朗了許多，告訴我這幾句話後，又賣了關</p>
<p>—賞你的錢吧？</p>
<p>—不不！</p>
<p>他笑了笑，否認。接着告訴我：說是呌他去討一筆債，對方是個辣手貨，討了幾决不肯還，這遭兒，老闆發了脾氣，呌他去辦這件事：軟不來用硬，硬不來就拉到行裏去，好歹這遭兒要榨出油來。最後他說：可不是我要行老運了，老闆親口答應的：討來了和我二八拆賬。</p>
<p>—這一回該可　拍張相片了。</p>
<p>他嗤嗤地笑着，走了。</p>
<p>今兒我又在這屋子裏瞧見了他。</p>
<p>一點兒沒有改變，老態依然，臉上的邊鬰好像更深了些，在眼稍多了一塊毒。</p>
<p>—怎麽了，你那兒？</p>
<p>我指着他的左眼梢。</p>
<p>他咳着，夾着嘆氣，又一連搖着腦袋：</p>
<p>—這，這是給那無賴打了。媽的，那無賴，眞兇，少了錢不還，還打人！他把我的眼角打了。</p>
<p>—後來呢？</p>
<p>—後來我和一個伙計把他拉到行裏去了。</p>
<p>—那末老闆一定有綫賞你的。</p>
<p>好像我這句話觸着了他的痛處，他猛地站了起來，那雙細小的眼裏閃着憤怒的光。</p>
<p>—他媽的！那沒良心的種子！我受了傷，他反說我沒用，把我的生意歇了。</p>
<p>停了一會，他的憤怒轉成了悲哀，忽然長嘆了一聲！</p>
<p>—幾時我才可以拍張相片呢？</p>
<p>接着他又嗆咳起來，臉脹得通紅，額上的靑筋全鼓得像蚯蚓似地。</p>
<p>在他那一連串的咳聲裏，我彷彿聽見一個垂死的人的呻吟。（完）</p>

<p>— 丁尼</p>
<p>呌半邊舉人在三張剪得方方的紅紙上，寫了「興隆館」三個行書，把破舊招牌上的褪了漆的「大興館」剛好蓋住。掛起四盞紅布燈籠，一派的新店的氣象了。</p>
<p>靠門檻的一張櫃台上，靑石缸堆得像小墳山那麼高，全盛得滿滿的，醬排骨，發芽荳，熱騰騰的冒着一般般不同的味兒？直向人們鼻子裏鑽。靑花碟子上，也放着幾樣下酒的菜。提着五兩糟燒的酒鬼，用二隻髒得像火柑那樣的手指，用柑取了一些沒有肉絲的辣椒炒肉絲，放到嘴裏咀嚼了好一陣，似乎不够玩兒，又去柑了些什麽放到嘴裏咀嚼。這才把好像早已决定了的發芽荳拿了一碟跑進去。</p>
<p>「要是有一班吹鼓手够多麼熱鬧」。坐在櫃台邊的一張高凳上的王老闆這樣想着，把剛才望着四盞紅燈籠露着的一絲笑容隱下去了。可是，他想着這幾年來給人家做小夥計，居然也有一天自立門戶開起店來，他又笑啦！</p>
<p>黃胖把鐵鍋子打得挺響的，有無調門兒。堂倌喂的一聲應着，就把灶頭邊燒好了的湯麵端了進去。猪汕放到發紅在空鍋裏放了一些生的料子，蓋上了蓋。一面又伸出一條，給爐火燒光了汗毛的胳膊，端起一鍋子滿滿的麵，很熟練地分到灶頭邊放着的比面盆小些兒的粗坏大碗上去，一碗又一碗。</p>
<p>「拿着滿鍋子的麵像是沒那麽一回事似的，他的胳膊可眞有勁兒。可是，那個混蛋給他取了黃胖的綽號呢」？王老闆有點為他能幹的灶頭司務抱不平。</p>
<p>灶頭邊一堆「來傢伙（註一）的客人拿着粗坏大碗的湯麵低低說着便宜走了。接着，又是一堆粗坏大碗送上來，喊着「下一碗湯麵」！</p>
<p>數着二十二個銅子，又數着二十二個銅子。王老闆覺得今天的湯麵生意還不錯。他忽然想到他用的那位像百靈鳥似的堂倌幹麽這樣不起勁。他回過頭去望望堂老爺在幹什麽？幹什麽？百靈鳥正捧着一隻茶杯，慢慢兒一口口的呌着茶。堂裏有着二個客人，一個王老闆是認得的酒鬼，另外一個正在那裏吃着湯麵、吃得滿頭大汗的。王老闆本想對堂倌發作，看情形也就不說什麽了。</p>
<p>『堂吃』（註二）的客人怎麼這樣少呢？點心店全靠『堂吃』的客人多，可以賺一點錢。今天的湯麵是虧本的生意啊！王老闆憂愁的地望望抽屜裏的一堆銅子，「一個下半天，還沒看見一變角子。這樣，不是要關門的嗎」？</p>
<p>他死艘的沉思着，好一回，他才張開了眼皮。肚了裏留下一條不關店的計劃：「把老婆從鄕下接出來，呌她來掌櫃，自己跑堂，這樣不是行了嗎」，</p>
<p>這時，店外跑進來一個穿西裝的，後面跟着一個穿短衫的。王老闆以為是大客人，正想立起招呼。那個穿西裝的就響亮地說話了：「老闆，今天早晨對你說過的話怎麼樣了」？</p>
<p>王老闆一見是垃圾鬼，心裏頭一急。可是他立卽勉强地堆下一副笑臉，「請坐！請坐！堂倌倒茶！</p>
<p>「不用客氣」。垃圾鬼沒坐，把堂倌授過來的茶放在一邊：「怎麽樣？你說啊」？接着，把王老闆拉到後門口，低低地說：「這是規矩如此，每一家新開店都逃不過的，而且……」。</p>
<p>「可是，先生，我的本錢全化完了。今天的生意又不好，還祇賈了四五元……」</p>
<p>「不要說啦！照你這樣說，我還得放你一點本」？垃圾鬼的口氣變得凶狠狠了；「到底怎麽樣」？</p>
<p>「先生，實在沒有辦法，袛好請你原諒我」！</p>
<p>「哼！胡桃裏肉，不敲不成」！垃圾鬼跑到門過：「來！這隻紅燒鷄已經典了。那隻排骨上面有蒼蠅。不衛生，把它倒了」。</p>
<p>跟在垃圾鬼後的人便捧了二缸東西要倒，王老闆想攔住，給垃圾鬼一把推開了。二缸東西便撲的倒在狗嘴桶（註三）。</p>
<p>「還有上面的烟囱眾子做得不好，有碍衛生，限你明天裏做過。我明天來看時，要是沒有做好，不容氣，請你到</p>
<p>王老闆眼角邊掛着二顆淚珠，呆呆地望着狗嚼桶。</p>
<p>（註一）拿傢伙上門去買。</p>
<p>（註二）跑到店堂去吃。</p>
<p>（註三）盛吃客吃剩了的東西的桶。</p>
<h3 id="c213">鴨 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>太陽已經跌進對過的山峯里，一片晚霞染紅了天空，每一個茅屋頂上的烟囱里吹着縷縷黑烟，是晚飯時候了。</p>
<p>朱大娘，一個寡老婆子，提着一支細長的竹竿，站在河邊上「吁吁」地趕着鴨子進棚。那些鴨子是夏天捉來的，現在已經長着紅色的脚掌，光亮的羽毛，在小溪里自己覓尋食物了。聽見朱大娘吁吁的聲音，它們排成隊伍似的，呷呷呌着，魚貫地尋上岸來，跟着朱大娘的細竹竿輕輕一揚，像小孩子知道自己的家，搖擺着沿岸塘走去了。</p>
<p>朱大娘一個軍官似的殿在最後，嘴里還是吁吁地做着聲音。走過李大嬸的門口，大嬸剛同兒子吃過飯想搬桌子板橙回屋去睡覺。</p>
<p>「大娘，那些鴨子長得大了。」</p>
<p>李大嬸是最看重朱大娘的，說她一個寡老婆子靠着紡紗織布，養鷄養鴨過日子，一個男子漢家恐怕也沒有她的本領呢。所以，在這塘上和大娘最合得來的就是李大嬸。她還常常和那些瞧不起寡老婆的同塘人說：做寡老婆子也是命苦，她又不犯法，不搶偷，看她那樣耐苦勤勞，要是一個男子漢的話，怕不是個大好老！快些別說碰着寡老婆子倒霉一，這樣寡老婆子照了燈亮還沒處找呢。</p>
<p>朱大娘見大嬸說話，馬上放慢脚步說：「是的，虧得池塘里油水（魚蝦之類）多，田螺價鈿也便宜。像去年那樣子瘟鴨，寡老婆子這幾根骨頭也沒處埋了！」</p>
<p>說着朱大娘自己也笑了，她不是笑自己的話說得太露骨，她笑着那羣鴨子已齊集在家門口，呷呷呌着，它們在旁候一頓豐盛的晚餐了。</p>
<p>「大嬸，你家根富喜歡吃鴨子，過幾天我送一個過來。」</p>
<p>「不要，不要！你辛辛苦苦養着，好意思吃你的嗎？有小的讓一個我，饞饞阿根的嘴吧。」</p>
<p>朱大娘沒有聽她的話，匆匆走上塘岸了。她門口已放着一籃田螺，那羣鴨子都圍着籃子呌，但是這頓豐盛的晚餐用大娘帮着動手的，鴨吃田螺就沒有在池塘里瞧見。一尾小魚一翻身吞過來那樣容易，朱大娘坐到板橙上，先數着有沒有走失的，然後捉起近手的一個來，捧着它的腹部看它有沒有吃飽，這樣敞開它的嘴塞田螺的多少。一面又隨手放到竹籠罩里去。鴨子塞了田螺，都漲在細小的頸項里，於是罩里呌着撲着，直到那些田螺送進了胃囊，才像一個人用過了晚餐一樣，舒適　在籠子里等候大娘送它們到棚里去。</p>
<p>一個個輪着塞田螺，天色不知不覺已經全黑了。朱大娘從板橙上撑了個懶腰，在黑暗里摸進屋子去，燃了手照，（一種最簡單的燈亮）　回出外提了籠子回棚，才安心上了　門。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>燒中飯一頓，晚上用開水冲着冷飯吃了就算數；然而她太疲倦，有時候常常伺候了鴨子就躺到床上去，她需要休息比吃飯史要緊。</p>
<p>今天她太高興了，那些鴨子都已長大了，一個都沒有死去，再過幾天，鎭上館子里有收鴨的下塘來，她就可以滿滿地賣一筆錢。那些鴨子從捉來養到這樣大，是費去她許多心血的，有了這筆錢，秋天她可以休息一時到冬天再紡紗。想着，她又踅到鴨棚邊去審視，看糊門有沒有扭着，那些可恨的黃鼠狼常常拖去她的鴨子和鷄子的。</p>
<p>用開水冲冷飯，也不想我一點菜餚，兩碗飯很快地吞下肚去，懷着一團子高興她上床睡了。或許今晚上朱大娘要做個高興的夢，夢見她的兒子回來，她不再是個寡老婆子了。</p>
<h3 id="c214">河畔 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>——襟河記之——</p>
<p>粗大的兩柱，在白楊樹和蘆葦上哆嗦着，灰沉沉的風霧，開始把襟河瀰漫着了。在蘆葦裏，風在飛掠着，成羣的野鴨子被驚擾着在空中飛旋起來，絕望地拍着翅膀又埋沒在另一叢蘆葦裏了。雨柱斜打在平靜的水面上，抖動了一下，馬上便變成一團一團的波團，波動着，擴大着，幾十百個碰在一起，就泛成一陣小小的波濤，它遠遠地隨着風底飄動，敲擊在船板上，便發出了嗚嗚的嗚聲。</p>
<p>船夫堵着一副不高興的嘴面，爬進艙來，說河面上已經起了風了，雨又是下的那麽大，不能再走，只好等風雨過去了才能够走。我們想一想：暴風雨裏行船危險也是事實，幾天前沒起身時，不是近在報上看見颶風要上中國海的消息嗎？於是也就答應了·</p>
<p>船夫把船靠駛靠了岸，在一列白楊樹下丟着錨，停泊着了。卸了帆，他便爬進艙來，坐着抽小烟袋。</p>
<p>雨仍在抖嗦着，敲打在薄鐵片做成的船篷上，便發出了輕脆的響聲。我們都靜寞地科躺在舖位上，靜聽那尖厲的風嘯和雨聲，它們非常有力地，把我們底思索都吸引着了。</p>
<p>慢慢地雨聲變得鬆散而且緩慢了，可是風仍在掠着。船夫把手中的烟袋望船板一敲，把烟燼敲了出來，又用足把剩餘的火花踏熄，便默默的爬了出去，在艙上站立着，又回過頭向我們低低的說道：雨就要熄了。……」</p>
<p>他沉默着，好像就在傾聽什麽似的。沒過了多少時間，忽然他底兩手就抖索了起來，面孔泛成靑白色，嘴巴痙攣着，爬進了艙來，拿不安而又惶惑的眼睛向大家看着。</p>
<p>他底動作的兀突改變很使我奇異，便向他查問着。他深深地把眉頭皺了一皺，便用憂慮的口吻說道：</p>
<p>「這事管不得，先生。……」又作着深思的樣子，側了一隻耳朶注意地聽着，我們好像也受了威染似的注意起來。有一種嘈雜的聲息，低弱而又柔細地，正在遠遠響着，有時又會變得那麽嘹亮淸晳，有時又悄然地寂靜着了。</p>
<p>「這是一種呌號聲。……」俊用病痛也似的聲調喃喃着。</p>
<p>「而且好像是從女人底喉嚨裏發出的，……我接着說。</p>
<p>船夫不安地聳一聳肩，又爬着出去，在航口悄悄的站着，我們好像受了什麽底吸引似的也跟着。</p>
<p>雨已經止歇了，細小的雨絲仍在飄蕩着，天色非常蒼翠，泛着藍色。在船板上，我們提心吊膽地團隨着發出聲音的那邊擭索着；可是我們什麽也沒有看見。</p>
<p>「在那邊，你們看着。……」船夫回過頭來，用手遠遠的一指，我們隨着看去，是的在那邊，面着襟河的一個小小村，排列着的有七八家農家小屋。在屋門前，是一個長長的打禾塲。這塲裏是空泛而且荒凉的，在這時就有十幾個着灰色衣服的從，魚貫着水一家的屋裏出來，他們都凌亂地光着頭，面孔漲得紅紅的，有的手中抓着一隻鷄，（它常常不服氣地，鼓起兩隻翅膀哀哀的呌着）；有的猶在手中抓着一把刺刀，威脅地在空中揮動着。他們都像唱醉了酒似的，互相撞跌着。在另一面，正有三個人，鼓起短小的腿兒，合着趕逐一個年靑而又瘦削的女人，她底頭髪和纖長的衣裾，在空中高高的飄動着，嘴里發出急遽而又匆促的呌號聲，繞着禾塲，通通了田野飛馳着。……</p>
<p>「他們正在追趕着那女人。……」船夫有點絕望地，用愁悶的聲調說着。</p>
<p>「他們，是些什麽人？……」我不明白地問。</p>
<p>「駐在這兒近村的××義勇隊。……黃塘有一大隊，九脚灣也有一小隊，這是屬於黃塘的。在這兒，他們常常是無原無故地跑進了農家去，把看得見和拿得到的都搶光了，有一部份就去追趕年靑的女人。……」他說罷孑話，便愁悶地抬起頭看看蒼藍色的天空，嘴里喃喃的：雨已經歇北了，我們走吧！………」</p>
<p>抬起頭來看，雨絲已經沒有了，雲圍里，正有一團陽光在燜耀着。</p>
<h3 id="c215">寂寞 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>把第三個烟蒂拋進痰盂裏，那座擎在女神手掌裏的時計像百靈鳥一樣叮叮噹噹地打了十下，我搓搓手，覺得應該向主人辭別了。</p>
<p>主婦剛從主人身旁的沙發上站起來，她打着哈欠，或許她想後房走一次，但是瞧見我提過呢帽預備要走的樣子，又回到沙發裏，搶着我先說：</p>
<p>「×先生，不多坐一會兒嗎？」她的眼珠子一滾，向那擎着時計的女神瞥了一下。「十點鐘了。——有什麽的會嗎？」</p>
<p>她側着頭滾到丈夫坐着的沙發靠背上俏皮地笑起來。</p>
<p>「沒有什麽事吧？」丈夫正經地問我：「外面雨下得正大呢。」</p>
<p>他授了一枝烟捲給我。</p>
<p>一點事也沒有，才想着找這時年輕的夫婦來逃避一個寂寞的晚上。說起來上海的晚上是不寂寞的，反之，它正是熱鬧的開始呢？一方面果然太窮，沒有多餘的錢去買女人的笑，或者進戲院子去聽那些我所聽不懂的戲，還有一切其他的地方，都是顯示出上海的晚上是並不寂寞的。那末，在寓所裏也是够熱鬧的，樓下川流不息地有賣唱女郎的歌學，隔房有打麻雀的同志在那裏胡調，在各個房門口來兜生意的女人，吏是常常引起一片哄笑與掌聲……整個寓所是熱鬧的，它是上海的一角，——不，它正是上海的雛型呢！不過，我的心是寂寞的，就覺得上海的晚上是太寂寞了。</p>
<p>走出寓所的門，天空已經飄着兩絲。我低着頭，踏着目家的影子向冷落的馬路走，那些嘈雜的聲音漸漸遠離了我，才覺得精神煥發的想做一伴什麽事情。——其實這說法是不姿的，每天有許許多多的事情堆在我的腦子裏，而且須要我很快做完它的，因為過一天又有新的許許多多的事情堆在我的腦子裏了。不過我總是讓它們堆着，堆着，把我的腦子漲得發痛；終於，眞想做一點事情的時候，我已經沒法淸楚頭緒了。於是再　　，增着，我再沒有　什麼　情的時候了。所以，現在所說的想做一伴什麽事情，範圍是很小很小的，譬如找一個朋友談天之類。這樣想着，走過朋友的家的時候，我就毫不遲疑地按着他的門鈴了。</p>
<p>他是我們中學裏的舊同學。在學校時候，我們的感情是很好的，因為一次滲加南京路血案的遊行，我們都被捕了，我們曾在拘守所緊握着手，默默相對微笑着。不過畢業之後我們走了兩條路，他升了大學，大學畢業就娶一位年輕美貌的太太，更由於闊父親的帮助，拿着墊欵去做買辦，自然是很舒服的職業了。我沒有綫進大學，所找的職業都是短期的，失業常常像蛇一樣死不放鬆我。雖然他結婚的時億，我也是賓客之一，不過自己這副寒酸相我再沒有勇氣到他新居去會會他。今天我似乎並沒有想到這些事。</p>
<p>僕人進去通知後，朋友自己迎了出來，緊緊握着手，像從前一樣。他邀我上樓到他的臥室裏，介紹給我他的新婚的妻子，笑着說：「來得正好，我們太寂寞了。你聽，一到晚上，這裏就像枯廟，雖然東是無綫電，西也是無綫電，但是這些東西是最討厭的。」</p>
<p>他一口氣說完了　最後又補充了一句「你有空常常來談談。」</p>
<p>我微笑着接受了他太太授過來的烟捲。坐到溫軟的沙發裏的時候，向這富麗的臥室搜視了一眼，我心裏想着難道他們也會威到寂寞嗎？這裏像枯廟是不錯的，住宅區的馬路旁有不準捺汽車喇叭的特殊標幟，但是他們不會拿錢去買上海的熱鬧嗎？他們似乎不應該屬於寂寞的一羣的。</p>
<p>談着朋友說出寂寞的原因來了。</p>
<p>「上海眞住得厭了，跳舞塲，電影院……老是這一套，一到晚上，這個身體就好像沒有地方好安放。獃在家裏嗎……」</p>
<p>他搖搖頭，沒有說下去，大槪是太辜負這良宵了，所以他歡迎我來談談。但是我們的寂寞雖同，我們的路是兩條的，我們誰都不能為誰解這個難問題，或許多談之後更要增加彼此的寂寞。接過了他授過來的第四支烟捲，我站起身來告辭了。</p>
<p>「叨擾得很，你們也應該安睡了。」</p>
<p>太太向我撇撇嘴，彷彿她猜中了我有什麽約會，外面的雨不是下得很大嗎？</p>
<p>「有事情也不留你了。」朋友緊緊握着我的手，像從前一樣。「有空來談談，晚上我在家裏的時候多。」</p>
<p>門外下着很大的雨，因為是住宅區，沒有一輛黃包車拖過。我冒着雨走去，讓粗大的雨點打在我的面上，手上，身上，這雨點或許能够解除我一部份的寂寞。</p>

<p>九一八</p>
<p>××施毒禍神州。偌大省城一夕休。三字誤成千古恨。萬民共戴百年羞。想當年今日風波起。不覺日荏苒韶光已五秋。歲月如流容易過。緜緜此恨幾時休。義軍不幸遭星散。太息英雄志未酬。村落坵壚痕宛在。黃龍未飮恨悠悠。可憐十萬男兒血。換得幾土饅頭。眞是月冷黃昏狐兔泣。凄風苦雨吊荒坵。恐憐往事成陳跡。敢作斯文醒睡鷗。休因循。莫優遊。强鄰未必肯把野心收。</p>

<p>在以前，好萊塢的男明星雷門諾伐羅，為全世界女性所最崇拜的一位所謂美男子。但是現在大家的目光，却又轉移到勞勃泰勒身上去了。的確，他實在是一個難得的小生入材，現在他和洛麗泰揚合演了一部「湖山春暖」Secret　Intenlude，已定於今日（星期五）起在大光明公映，這也許是影迷們所喜歡聽見的一個消息吧。該片的故事，係描寫少主美婢的一段羅曼斯，並且對於階級的婚姻觀念，痛加攻擊，這一定是靑年情侶所最歡迎的一個作品。致於他們這兩位著名演員，演這樣的愛劇，當然是最拿手了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Li Zongren and Huang Xuchu Flew to Guangzhou Yesterday to Meet Chiang Kai-shek; Ju Zheng and Yu Hanmou Welcomed Them at the Airport; Li Expressed Delight at the Realization of Unification; Bai Remained in Guangxi Due to Troop Demobilization <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren, Huang Xuchu, along with Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong, flew to Guangzhou from Nanning in a large aircraft on the 17th morning, arriving at Tianhe Airport at 3:40 PM, and immediately proceeded to Huangpu to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Wang Xunzhi and Kan Zonghua arrived in the province from Hong Kong on the 17th noon to welcome Li, and established a Guisui (Guangxi-Suiyuan) Office in Guangzhou. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Deng Shizeng arrived in Hong Kong by car at 11:00 AM on the 17th to attend to private affairs and will return to the province within days. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Li Zongren, who assumed the post of Pacification Commissioner of Guangxi Province yesterday in Nanning as appointed by the Central Government, arrived here by plane this afternoon from Nanning. People from all walks of life in China believe that this event marks the beginning of a new era. The general public considers Li's visit to Guangzhou this time as one of the most significant and pleasant events since the founding of the Republic of China, as Guangxi was the last province to submit to the Central Government, and Li's arrival in Guangzhou today signifies the complete unification of the country. Li's plane arrived here at 3:45 PM this afternoon, accompanied by Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong, Guangxi Chairman Huang Xuchu, Chief of Staff Cheng Qian, and Guangxi Army Chief of Staff Liu Weizhang. The airport was heavily guarded by military police. A large number of high-ranking officials were present to welcome them, including Chiang Kai-shek's representative Qian Dajun, President of the Judicial Yuan Ju Zheng, Guangzhou Pacification Commissioner Yu Hanmou, and Guangzhou Chairman Huang Musong. Li appeared to be in high spirits and told a Reuters reporter that he was extremely pleased with the realization of national unification and that the demobilization of the Guangxi Army had already begun. Li and Yu Hanmou left the airport in the same car and attended a banquet held in his honor. Afterwards, they drove to Huangpu to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The meeting between the two was of great historical value, as these two leaders of the Chinese Revolution had been separated for five years due to differences in political views. It is reported that Bai Chongxi, who was appointed as a Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, will not come to Guangzhou for the time being. According to Bai, he must personally oversee the demobilization of the Guangxi Army, as the mobilized troops in Guangxi Province number no less than 300,000, and the responsibility for demobilization is quite burdensome, so he cannot leave for the time being. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong, who arrived here today from Nanning with Li Zongren, told reporters who visited him, "The situation in Guangxi has been completely resolved. Bai Chongxi will also come to Guangzhou after the demobilization of the Guangxi Army is completed." Huang also stated that the Guangxi Army in southern Guangdong has already been ordered to immediately withdraw to Guangxi, and martial law has been lifted throughout Guangxi Province. The ships and other vessels requisitioned by the authorities in the past have also been returned. All Chinese evening newspapers have published articles warmly welcoming Li Zongren, praising his construction work in Guangxi Province and his determination to serve the Central Government. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Li Zongren, Huang Xuchu, Liu Weizhang, and others, led by Cheng Qian and Huang Shaoxiong, took three planes from Nanning at 1:00 PM on the 17th and arrived in Guangzhou at 3:40 PM. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's representatives Chen Lifu, Qian Dajun, Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, and other important figures from the Guangdong military and political circles welcomed them at the airport. After disembarking, they first went to the former Fourth Army Group's office in Guangzhou. Li and Huang will pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek tonight or tomorrow. After exchanging courtesies regarding the peaceful resolution of the current situation, they will hold important discussions on the proper handling of the Beihai incident, as well as domestic and foreign affairs. According to Huang Shaoxiong, Li and Bai have ordered the troops of Weng Zhaoyuan and Qiu Zhaochen to withdraw to Guangxi and have requested Yu Hanmou to send Guangdong troops to take over the defense of the southern route. (17th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanning (Delayed) Guangxi Pacification Commissioner Li Zongren and Military Affairs Commission Standing Committee Member Bai Chongxi issued a peace telegram before taking office, addressed to all national institutions, organizations, and newspapers, and forwarded to all comrades and compatriots, stating roughly: Zongren and others, deeply saddened by the national crisis, driven by conscience and a sense of duty, initiated the previous call to arms to resist Japan and save the nation. The sole purpose was to use our actions and enthusiasm to urge the Central Government to lead the entire nation in a common hatred of the enemy and to resist foreign aggression. This humble intention should be understood by all Chinese people. However, before the will to resist the enemy could be realized, the calamity of internal strife was about to arise. The crisis of civil war was imminent, causing widespread anxiety and concern both at home and abroad. Fortunately, our Central Government, recognizing the patriotic sentiments of the people and unwilling to inflict further damage on our limited national strength, repeatedly dispatched high-ranking officials to Guangxi for inspection, thoroughly understanding the truth of all patriotic movements in Guangxi Province. At the same time, all the opinions of Zongren and others on national salvation were fully accepted. In the future, all national salvation work should be carried out under the overall strategic leadership of the Central Government, working together towards a unified effort. Our basic demands are purely directed outwards and not against anyone. We only seek the implementation of our proposals and have no personal interests or private views. At this juncture of peaceful settlement and political transition, fearing that distant reports may not fully convey the underlying situation, we hereby send this special telegram to inform you, hoping for your understanding. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, bowed in respect. (14th) Printed, (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Cheng Qian, Huang Shaoxiong, along with Li Zongren, Huang Xuchu, and Lei Yu, arrived in the province on a Junkers aircraft at 3:50 PM on the 17th. Ju Zheng, Yu Hanmou, Huang Musong, Qian Dajun, Xiang Hanping, Xu Jintang, Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner Zhong Tianming, Municipal Party Affairs Commissioner Wu Zhimei, and hundreds of representatives from various party, government, and military authorities and people's organizations welcomed them at the airport. Li Zongren, wearing a gray cloth military uniform and leggings, was full of energy. Upon disembarking, he shook hands with each of the welcomers and repeatedly expressed his thanks. Huang Xuchu, wearing a gray woolen Zhongshan suit, was gentle and amiable, with a beaming smile. They disembarked one after another and exchanged brief pleasantries with the welcomers before boarding cars into the city to attend a banquet hosted by Yu Hanmou and Huang Musong.

<p>(Tokyo) Our Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence at 2:30 PM on the 17th. The meeting lasted 40 minutes. Ambassador Xu informed Arita that Weng Zhaoyuan's troops are currently beginning to withdraw and should be completed within days, at which time the investigation should proceed smoothly. He requested Japan's patience. Arita replied that if the withdrawal could be completed within a few days, it would be fortunate, as unforeseen accidents might occur if the matter were delayed. He requested that Ambassador Xu pay attention to this. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Weng Zhaoyuan's troops began withdrawing from their positions on the southern route on the 16th. Yu Hanmou telegraphed Tan Sui's division to station troops in Qinlian, Beihai, and other places from Huaxian on the 18th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diao Zuqian telegraphed that Weng Zhaoyuan's troops stationed in Beihai have begun to withdraw, and the situation in Beihai has eased. Ling Shifen again took the Fokker ship to Beihai on the afternoon of the 17th to conduct a detailed investigation. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Diao Zuqian stated on the 17th that he sent Ling Shifen to Hong Kong again on the 16th to transfer to the Fuan warship to go to Beihai to investigate the Nakano case. The Japanese side will also send personnel to land for investigation after Weng's troops withdraw. This is a local incident and should not be expanded. If necessary, Yu will also go to Beihai.

<p>(Hong Kong) Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai are still in Yulin. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Diao Zuqian on the 17th stating that Secretary Ling Shifen, who was sent to Beihai to investigate the Nakano case, returned to Guangzhou from Beihai to report and then took a ship to Beihai again on the 16th. Furthermore, according to information received here, Weng's troops stationed in Beihai have now withdrawn. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources in diplomatic circles, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe has met with Foreign Minister Zhang Qun twice since arriving in Nanjing. He did not visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th. When he will visit Foreign Minister Zhang again is currently undecided. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The hot weather in Tokyo suddenly turned cool last night, and the gloom caused by the Beihai incident has also seen a glimmer of dawn since the news of Weng's withdrawal was received here. The news reported in today's newspapers seems more moderate than before. The Asahi Shimbun today has headlines such as "The Situation Has Changed" and "Signs of Moderation." The Nichinichi Shimbun also has the headline "Dawn of the Beihai Incident." If the investigation can proceed in the next few days, the focus of the situation will certainly be concentrated on the negotiations held in Nanjing. Tokyo expects that the scope of the negotiations will be much broader than just the aftermath of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents, and the duration of the Nanjing talks will inevitably be very long. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Weng Zhaoyuan's troops have withdrawn from Beihai today and will be replaced by Yu Hanmou's troops. When Ling Shifen returns to Beihai tomorrow, he will likely land in the area with Japanese investigators. Diao Minqian, the diplomatic envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi, told Reuters reporters here today that he hoped there would be no further obstacles to the future of the case. He believes this case will not develop into a crisis between China and Japan and affect relations between the two countries. At the same time, the Japanese consular authorities seem to be taking a rather moderate attitude towards this case, so far only requesting a joint investigation. The Japanese consul in Guangzhou denied to reporters who visited him today that a large number of Japanese warships had rushed to Beihai. So far, only the Saga has been dispatched to the area due to this case. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying visited Foreign Minister Arita at his official residence in Nagatacho at 2:30 PM on the 17th and, in accordance with instructions from the National Government, formally stated that Weng Zhaoyuan's troops had begun to withdraw. (17th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong authorities announced that Weng Zhaoyuan's troops in Beihai have begun to withdraw from the 16th in accordance with the orders of Li and Bai and are expected to be completed by tomorrow. Chiang Kai-shek and Yu Hanmou have telegraphed the 98th Division of the Central Army and the 154th Division of the Guangdong Army stationed in Tangchun and Gaoyao to take over Beihai. The two divisions are traveling day and night. The Yixian warship of the First Fleet is monitoring the withdrawal from the sea. Yu Hanmou appointed Zhong Juye as the special military commissioner for Qinlian to handle the aftermath. Chiang Kai-shek also sent Tang Xing, a senior staff officer of the Military Affairs Commission, to Beihai on the 17th to conduct an on-site investigation of the Nakano incident and handle the aftermath. (17th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Kawagoe met with Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun on the 15th to negotiate Sino-Japanese issues. The contents of the meeting were reported to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 16th. According to the report, regarding the Beihai incident, Minister Zhang stated to Kawagoe that even if Weng Zhaoyuan's troops withdraw from the southern route, efforts will be made to remove all obstacles to the investigation work on the ground. Therefore, the Japanese government decided to trust this statement and entrusted the Chinese government to handle the issue of Weng Zhao's troops, and instructed Ambassador Kawagoe to inquire of Minister Zhang in the second meeting about what measures would be taken to remove the obstacles to the investigation and whether they would be effective. Ambassador Kawagoe's negotiations with Minister Zhang are aimed at resolving the on-site investigation issue of the Beihai incident as soon as possible, and further striving to resolve various pending issues such as the North China issue, and focusing on adjusting the overall national relations between China and Japan. Ambassador Kawagoe will treat this fundamental issue as separate from the Beihai incident and strive to resolve it. (17th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Weng Zhaoyuan's troops have withdrawn from Beihai today and will be replaced by Yu Hanmou's troops. When Ling Shifen returns to Beihai tomorrow, he is expected to land in the area with the Japanese investigators. Diao Minqian, the diplomatic envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi, told Reuters reporters here today that he hoped there would be no further obstacles to the future of the case. He believes this case will not develop into a crisis between China and Japan and affect relations between the two countries. At the same time, the Japanese consular authorities seem to be taking a rather moderate attitude towards this case, so far only requesting a joint investigation. The Japanese consul in Guangzhou denied to reporters who visited him today that a large number of Japanese warships had rushed to Beihai. So far, only the Saga has been dispatched to the area due to this case. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Revival of the League of Nations <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>As we commemorate the painful September 18th incident, the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting is being held in Geneva, and the League of Nations General Assembly will also open on September 21st. Recalling five years ago, when Japan used violence to occupy our Northeast, giving the League of Nations an unprecedented blow, the Geneva peace organization suffered a fatal wound. In the past five years, Italy and Germany have spared no effort in destroying the League of Nations Covenant. Under the "fists and feet" of the aggressor countries, the League of Nations is on its last breath. Whether it can be saved depends on the efforts of the representatives in this Administrative Council meeting and General Assembly. In this time of crisis, I would like to offer a few words on the legacy of this peace organization.</p>
<p>To revive the League of Nations, there are thousands of things that should be done, but in general, the most urgent requirements are the revision of the League of Nations organization, the diligent implementation of disarmament regulations, the strengthening of sanction clauses, the amendment of international treaties to meet the needs of peace, and the application of the open-door principle to all member states. The Administrative Council is controlled by several European powers. With China's size, it does not have a permanent seat on the council. This is a major reason why the League of Nations' prestige cannot reach the entire world. It is appropriate to reallocate council seats based on continents or population size, so that the League of Nations can be democratized and not controlled by a few powerful countries. This is one point. Disarmament is the biggest goal of the Covenant, but so far, the regulations have not been implemented. The League of Nations has not drafted a concrete and detailed disarmament plan, and the countries have no sincerity in accepting it. If armaments are not reduced, suspicion will increase. The cause of war has not been removed, and the work of stopping the war is difficult. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Sanctions were applied to the Italo-Ethiopian War and completely failed. This is a major tragedy in the history of the League of Nations. Now, to revive the League of Nations, instead of abolishing the sanction regulations, it is better to make Article 16 of the Covenant more practical, that is, different countries have different burdens of sanction obligations. For example, if aggression occurs within the same continent, each country is responsible for military sanctions, while other countries in the world are only responsible for economic sanctions. If they want distant countries to help with military force, it is not their wish. If they still supply economic necessities to the aggressor country, then sanctions will be ineffective. Therefore, regional agreements must coexist with collective peace, so that punishing the wicked can be effective. This is the central issue of discussion at this General Assembly, and it is also related to the survival of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>As for achieving lasting peace, it still depends on active work. Merely maintaining the status quo cannot force the suppression of injustice. The foundation of peace should be built on justice and mutual assistance. Therefore, treaties and facts that violate justice and the international principles of freedom and equality should be amended at any time. Although the Covenant has provisions for amending treaties, they have never been applied in the past. International mutual assistance depends on economic interdependence and mutual supply and demand. Open doors have a very different impact on humanity than closed doors. It is recently heard that the League of Nations is planning to convene a second economic conference, which is also due to this. Only economic coexistence and co-prosperity can achieve political peace. The way to peace seems complicated but is actually simple. May the representatives of the League of Nations pay attention to it again and again.</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Ministry of Finance Advocates: No Ban on Wheat Exports; No Export Tax on Wheat Either <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Baoding Chamber of Commerce and Shanghai merchant Gu Lugui previously telegraphed the Executive Yuan, stating that new wheat was entering the market and that foreigners were using capital to absorb it. They requested a ban on wheat exports or, when wheat was exported, the imposition of taxes based on import precedents to close loopholes. The Executive Yuan forwarded this to the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance believes that at the beginning of the new wheat season this year, Shanghai's foreign wheat prices fell. Later, due to poor wheat harvests in the United States and Canada, market prices soared, and China's wheat prices were also driven up. However, prices are still lower than when the new wheat entered the market. Regarding the issue of foreign merchants purchasing wheat in China, according to statistics from the National Tariff Commission, it is no more than 100,000 metric tons. Furthermore, the customs records show that the total amount of wheat exported in the first half of this year was 27,623 metric tons, which is a decrease compared to the same period last year. With a bountiful autumn harvest this year, allowing free circulation of domestic wheat should not affect people's livelihoods or hinder the flour industry. Furthermore, the customs has never banned wheat exports or taxed rice and wheat exports in the past, while taxing rice and wheat imports, to ensure the free circulation of domestic rice and wheat and prevent the dumping of foreign grain, so that farmers can receive real benefits. If a sudden ban on wheat exports or the imposition of export taxes were implemented when wheat prices are slightly higher and there are a few foreign shipments, it would seem to contradict the government's original intention of protecting the rural economy. Moreover, the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Cake Association has petitioned the government for relief, stating that wheat is stockpiling and congesting the market, and if exports are not urgently promoted, it will harm rural areas and hinder finance. This shows that merchants have different viewpoints due to their different positions. If wheat exports are banned, it is feared that disputes will arise. As a result of the Ministry's review, it does not support approving the requests of the Baoding Chamber of Commerce and Gu Lugui and has submitted this to the Executive Yuan for review.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters recently clarified the doubts raised by various parties regarding the invalidation of ballots: (1) If the name written on the ballot does not match the name recorded in the citizen register or the register of officials and members, but it can be proven that it is definitely the same person, it should be considered valid. (2) If the name or alias of the nominee is inconsistent, such as one ballot writing the name and another ballot writing the alias, if it can be proven that it is definitely the same person, the ballot writing the alias should also be considered valid. (3) Common writing styles, such as writing the "欠" radical of "漱" as "文," and (4) abbreviated writing styles, such as writing "萬" as "万," "陞" as "升," and "齋" as "垒," should all be considered valid. (5) The nominee's place of origin should be noted on the nomination ballot, as explicitly stipulated in the first section of Article 6 of the Implementing Regulations for the Election Law. Therefore, if the nominee's place of origin is not filled in, the nominee is invalid. (6) If the number of nominees recorded on the ballot exceeds the legal limit, they should be counted in order, and those exceeding the limit are invalid, but those within the limit are valid. (7) If the nomination ballot has the nominee's nickname, (8) if the names of the nominees written are homophones with different characters, (9) if the candidate has already changed their name, but the nominator still writes their original name, the above three points, if it can be accurately proven that they all refer to the same person, and there is no conflict with the headquarters' established standards for invalid ballots, the nomination ballot should be considered valid. However, it is more difficult to prove whether homophones with different characters refer to the same person, so it should be handled with particular caution.

<h3 id="e38">Stimson Disclosed the Principles of US Policy Towards China; Fulfilling Treaty Obligations and Maintaining Friendship; China's Future Must Develop on Its Own <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The book "The Far Eastern Crisis: Recollections and Observations" by former US Secretary of State Stimson will be published today by the Council on Foreign Relations. China occupies an important place in the book, and Stimson describes the basic principles of US policy during Japan's invasion of Manchuria as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Fulfill all treaty obligations to maintain future friendly relations between China and the United States.</p>
<p>(2) Safeguard the foundation of cooperative action to maintain world peace. According to Stimson, the above two principles are often criticized as having exceeded the usual course of diplomatic action. Stimson said, "I am prepared to deal with this kind of criticism. Even in peacetime, a foreign minister cannot allow his vision to be obscured by temporary events. But as it is today, new developments occur almost daily, which may have a significant impact on the future, and the danger of taking a narrow view of the entire purpose is greatly increased."</p>
<p>Stimson's book also states about China: "The future of China is a major issue of the times. One thing is quite clear, that China must develop on its own and cannot be controlled or driven by foreign forces, making it an unwanted evolution from the outside. China has the world's oldest culture and 4,000 years of history to prove it. The peaceful nature of China's internal culture is the main stabilizing element in Asia today. The loss of this element in China will directly affect the peace of its neighbors, including the United States. If this loss is caused by the United States disregarding its treaty obligations, then this policy is too short-sighted. Some Americans believe that to solve the Manchuria problem, the United States and Japan must agree on a solution that benefits Japan. They have forgotten that the Manchuria problem is China's most important fundamental problem. Any agreement or solution that Japan agrees to at present will be seen by China as destructive and rejected."</p>
<p>Stimson also discussed the efforts of cooperation between the United States and Britain, saying that in February 1932, as the world situation became increasingly dark, he consulted with President Hoover and proposed to the British Ambassador to the United States that the United States and Britain jointly fulfill their obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty to stop Japan's actions. A few days later, Stimson also spoke with British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon over the transatlantic wireless telephone and urged him to agree. Stimson also said, "I further discussed this matter with Sir John Simon in London on February 13th and 15th. Although Simon did not explicitly reject my proposal, it was clear from his attitude that the British government was unwilling to join, so I did not urge it further."</p>
<p>Therefore, Stimson wrote to Senator Borah, reiterating the US insistence on the non-recognition policy. Stimson went on to describe the necessity of future cooperation between the United States and Britain, saying, "I have earnestly explained our experience of cooperation with the British government and believe that the ultimate development of European collective action, whether through the current League of Nations or by other means, the great responsibility of leadership will inevitably be borne by the British government and its dominions. This is unavoidable. I believe that this responsibility of leadership should not be hindered by the fear that collective action will be obstructed by non-League members such as the US government. This is the most important way to guarantee this security and the cooperation of the two governments. All executive steps that occupy an important part in international action must be sincere, effective, and traditional." (Reuters dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) On the 14th of this month, People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Voroshilov inspected the training troops of the Kiev Military District and delivered a speech praising the order and organization of the exercise as excellent. He also expressed his gratitude to the workers and collective farmers for their help and care for the Red Army. The next day, the troops held a grand parade. Voroshilov delivered another speech congratulating the soldiers, commanders, and political commissar Yagil. After the speeches, the troops held a grand parade lasting two hours. (TASS dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Defense Commissioner Voroshilov arrived in Zhitomir on the 16th, where he was warmly welcomed by local party and government leaders and 150,000 people. The whole city was extremely lively. The people held a welcome rally in the square in front of the station. Representatives of the workers delivered welcoming speeches, mentioning their happy lives and progress in culture and economy, as well as their determination to rise up at any time to defend the socialist motherland.</p>
<p>Voroshilov then gave a reply, representing the Central Party Department and the government to congratulate all the workers of Ukraine. He continued, "You have expressed to me on behalf of the Party and the government that the workers of the whole of Ukraine and its capital will be an unshakable vanguard of our socialist motherland. The Soviet Union has many enemies. They are trying to turn our socialist country into a field of rubble, and our workers into the slaves of nineteen years ago. But the enemies are completely wrong. They do not know the strength and consolidation of the Soviet Union. They do not know that the collective cooperation of our 170 million people has made extraordinary achievements in all aspects of socialist construction. They can move forward on a new path of life, eliminating any obstacles from the enemy. We must bear in mind the lessons of Lenin and Stalin. We must be prepared at any time to build socialism while not forgetting to defend socialism. This lesson has been accepted by all our workers. They are strengthening national defense while building, and are inextricably linked with the strong worker-peasant Red Army. "Our Red Army is you. We are not only your blood and flesh, but also your spirit, thoughts, expectations, and hopes. We can swear to you that our Red Army worker-peasant soldiers will never fail your expectations and will never make you uneasy. The people of Kiev know well the actions that the enemies of the workers can take. In the past three years, Kiev has been occupied fifteen times by different enemies, transferred from the hands of one despicable enemy to another. The working men and women of Kiev can remember the madness of the capitalists, the barbarity, cruelty, stupidity, and rudeness shown in this city. You can remember the past, but the past will never come again. Although some gentlemen are dreaming of setting foot on Soviet territory, they will never succeed. Our government. Our Party. Our great Stalin himself has repeatedly declared sincerely to the world that our country is a country of peace, a country that can guarantee peace throughout the world. Our country was the first to propose disarmament. Although we dearly love our Red Army and are deeply proud of its organization, combat effectiveness, weapons, and good condition, we are still willing to disband this Red Army without hesitation and send it to factories and collective farms if capitalist countries accept our disarmament proposal. But our class enemies cannot accept it. They are not entirely because they fear us. They claim that we are red warlords and that our Red Army is preparing to attack, which is a deliberate lie. They do not want disarmament because they fear their own people and their own workers. Our country is a peaceful country. Our Red Army is not only our country's most willing to do its best to guarantee peace in the world. If we cannot succeed in this regard, it is not our fault. If any enemy attempts to attack our country and force all our workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the men and women of our country to stop building great socialist buildings and mobilize arms, then comrades, we are ready to fight them (thunderous applause). I have just returned. I saw the large-scale exercises in the Belorussian Military District and the tactical exercises in the Kiev District of Sheptovka. These two exercises have shown that our Red Army has grown as much as our workers and peasants. We have not saved a single day of eating Soviet bread. We have made great progress in the past year. We have "jumped" from junior high school or high school to university (applause). I can assure all the workers of Ukraine that whenever our enemy launches a mad attack, our Red Army will be able to resist it with all its strength. I have stated repeatedly, and I now repeat it to the whole of Ukraine, that we have only one wish, that is, if the enemy attacks Ukraine, Belarus, or any part of the Soviet Union, we will not only not let the enemy enter our motherland by one step, but will defeat them in the place from which they came (applause and cheers). This statement does not conflict with my previous statement that our Red Army and country are still the guarantee of peace. The current war will be extremely brutal and terrible because it possesses vicious weapons that the world has never seen or heard of before. In this way, you can imagine how unimaginable the destruction would be if the battle took place on our territory. Therefore, we must prepare a method, and not only the worker-peasant Red Army but even all of you workers, must be prepared in advance. If the enemy appears, they must be defeated immediately in their own territory (applause and cheers), and they must be severely injured so that after receiving a lesson, they will never dream of turning our workers and collective farmers into slaves. We should be excellent teachers, Bolshevik teachers, and use this method to teach those gentlemen so that if they can survive to that time, they will warn their great-grandchildren never to attack the Soviet state again (applause). A ten-day air defense exercise is currently being held here, which is the best thing. I congratulate all the participating comrades. This kind of air defense exercise should be held not only by a certain person, not only by this beautiful and glorious Kiev, but by all places in the country where people live. At present, aviation, especially high-speed aviation, can reach any place at any time, even our vast motherland. For this reason, you must organize truly reliable air defense, so that in this beautiful city of Kiev, all weapons have appropriate defense methods. Aviation is not omnipotent. If the air defense is organized properly, aviation cannot cause great damage, and our city has not only anti-aircraft guns, but also a glorious air force and heroic and outstanding aviators. Comrades, I thank you for your welcome and congratulations. I accept it on behalf of the worker-peasant Red Army and will convey it to our Central Party Department and government, as well as to our great Stalin. I will tell Stalin that not only his capital Kiev, but even the workers of the entire Ukraine, have become a truly outstanding Soviet collective. They not only work in the Stakhanov method, but are also the pioneers and organizers of the Stakhanov socialist construction method, and at the same time, they are a collective that can join the ranks of the worker-peasant Red Army at any time and rise up to defend their great socialist motherland." (Tidal wave of applause and cheers, lasting for a long time. (TASS dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian authorities are promoting a policy of building roads with convict labor. They are now rushing to build two military motor roads to the Polish border to cope with the Western border war crisis. There are now thousands of convicts working in shifts of 24 hours to rush the construction. At night, the lights illuminate the area like daylight. The roads currently under construction are the eastern sections of the main roads to Minsk and Kiev, and are expected to be completed by November 7. The Soviet Russian authorities do not admit that these roads have military value, but the progress of their construction is obviously faster than the construction of other important roads. Minsk and Kiev are both important towns in Soviet Russia. (National Electric dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations, in accordance with the resolution passed by the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly in July, solicited the opinions of the member states on the amendment of the Covenant. The Chinese government recently sent a proposal to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, advocating that the Covenant of the League of Nations, especially Article 11 of the Covenant, which contains measures to prevent war, should be strengthened as much as possible, and the definition of the aggressor should also be clearly defined. Regarding measures to prevent war, the Chinese government believes that this can be implemented without the approval of all members of the Executive Council. Regarding the various sanction measures contained in Article 16 of the Covenant, it advocates the establishment of a permanent committee of experts to formulate long-term and effective provisions so that the sanction measures can be "automatically, immediately, and fully implemented." In addition, it also suggests the establishment of a special committee to decide in advance on the military sanction measures to be taken in an emergency. As for the conclusion of regional security treaties, the Chinese government is willing to accept its principles, but only if this treaty does not go beyond the scope of the Covenant.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly will hold an important meeting next Monday. Now that the exiled Emperor of Abyssinia has decided to send a representative to attend, an abnormal situation seems to be arising. It is widely speculated that the Credentials Committee will refuse to recognize the existence of any independent government in Abyssinia. Therefore, whether the Emperor of Abyssinia is still qualified to send a representative to attend the League of Nations General Assembly has become a question. It is also expected that the Italian request to represent Abyssinia will be ignored by the League of Nations. Mr. Lammass, the Foreign Minister of Argentina, has the best chance of being elected as the chairman of this General Assembly. Mr. Lammass has always advocated not recognizing the fruits of aggression, so his position seems to be difficult. As for the United Kingdom, it will send a powerful delegation to the General Assembly. Foreign Secretary Eden, who recently recovered from chickenpox, will be the head of the delegation. Other representatives are the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords, Viscount Halifax, Foreign Under-Secretary Cranborne, and Dominion Secretary Malcolm MacDonald. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, received a note from the Emperor of Abyssinia this morning, stating that he has appointed Walkerner and Sheesh as representatives of his country to attend the current League of Nations General Assembly.

<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia recently made a statement in Amharic to our correspondent, saying, "Whether I will go to Geneva when the League of Nations General Assembly opens is still undecided. I will make a decision after the report of our delegation is submitted. If necessary, I plan to preside over it personally. As for our delegation, it was originally formed in accordance with the law. The League of Nations has no other attitude to take except to recognize the rights it should enjoy." He also said that the government of Gore in western Abyssinia does not have enough arms for self-defense and should purchase them from foreign countries, but he has not yet requested the British government to allow travelers and goods from his country to pass through the British territory of East Africa, and it is not yet known whether the French government will allow them to pass through the territory of France due to the tense situation in Europe. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Abyssinian Embassy in the United Kingdom announced today that the Abyssinian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Dr. Martin, will go to Geneva to attend the annual General Assembly of the League of Nations. As for whether the Emperor of Abyssinia is preparing to attend Geneva personally, according to Abyssinian sources here, no decision has been made yet, but it is said that the local leaders who are continuing to resist in western Abyssinia are still maintaining regular contact with the Emperor. The general public in the United Kingdom is quite concerned about the decision of Abyssinia to send a representative to Geneva, and it is not known what attitude the British delegation will take on the issue of recognizing the qualifications of the Abyssinian representative to attend the League of Nations. It is up to the Credentials Committee of the General Assembly to decide whether the Abyssinian representative can participate in the work of the League of Nations General Assembly. However, some left-wing figures believe that if the Abyssinian delegation can attend Geneva, it will make Italy take a more accommodating attitude towards participating in the Locarno Five-Power Conference. What Italy hopes is that the Abyssinian affair should be completely settled in the international arena after the Abyssinian affair. In fact, the Italian war in Abyssinia has not ended, and Italy is still far from completely controlling Abyssinia. If Italy is too hasty in Geneva, it will instead unite other countries against the settlement of the Abyssinian affair. This should also be a concern for Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian Embassy in the United Kingdom announced today that the Emperor of Abyssinia has decided to send a delegation to represent Abyssinia at the League of Nations General Assembly. The League of Nations may receive formal notification of this matter tomorrow. According to international sources, the League of Nations may raise some questions about the validity of the credentials of the Abyssinian delegation, thereby preventing the Abyssinian delegation from participating in the work of the General Assembly. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here unanimously believe that the Abyssinian decision to send a representative to Geneva will result in Italy not attending the League of Nations General Assembly. According to responsible sources, although the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, came to Rome some time ago to consult with the Italian government, the Italian government has not taken any binding measures on the issue of Italian cooperation with Geneva. Therefore, whether Italy will attend the League of Nations General Assembly will depend on the final situation. Even if the credentials of the Abyssinian delegation are deemed invalid by the League of Nations General Assembly, if the Abyssinian delegation is already in Geneva, the Italian delegation will inevitably delay attending the League of Nations General Assembly, because the fascist government must obtain guarantees so that the Italian representative will not meet the Abyssinian representative in Geneva before it can send a representative to attend the League of Nations General Assembly.

<p>(Paris) With the League of Nations General Assembly and Executive Council about to open, the French delegation has been officially announced, consisting of Foreign Minister Delbos, former Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, and Minister of Economy Steinas as the main representatives, and Minister of Commerce Bassette and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Bellanger as the deputy representatives. As for the attitude that the delegation should adopt at the League of Nations, it will be determined after the Foreign Minister has consulted with friendly countries, especially the representatives of certain countries in the Little Entente. But in general, there are several items: (1) France will discuss various economic issues at length. This can be seen from the fact that Minister of Economy Spinasse and Minister of Commerce Basset are attending the League of Nations. In addition, the League of Nations Economic Committee, which met on the 9th of this month, also advocated convening an international economic and tariff conference, which is welcome to France. (2) Since the French Parliament recently voted to add funds to improve military equipment, the government intends to launch an initiative to stop the arms race, and the French delegation should follow this principle and make proposals. (3) Regarding the issue of strengthening the League of Nations Covenant, the French delegation already expressed its attitude at the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly at the end of June, and should continue to do so. (4) The French delegation should join the British delegation to contact the Portuguese Foreign Minister Monteiro again and urge Portugal to send a representative to participate in the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War. Other issues such as the Free City of Danzig and the Abyssinian issue have become secondary matters and can be discussed at leisure, especially since the Emperor of Abyssinia's decision to send a representative to the General Assembly has raised procedural issues, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, may make a proposal.

<p>(Rome) According to official announcements, the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary will meet in Vienna in the near future. According to Gaida's article in the government newspaper Italian Daily, the establishment of a separate Danube group with the Little Entente is no longer a problem, but the three countries must unite and arm themselves to deal with the dangerous repercussions caused by any unfortunate event. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt, who came here to consult some time ago, returned to Austria this morning. Schmidt's visit is actually a wide-ranging diplomatic activity, that is, the prelude to the plenary meeting of the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian group in Vienna, and the Vienna meeting is intended to rival the recent permanent political meeting of the Little Entente countries. Since the Little Entente countries have mutually recognized their greater freedom of action in foreign policy, the Rome group should take this opportunity to intensify its united movement, and at the same time conduct separate bilateral talks with the Little Entente countries, so that the Danube issue can be fully resolved. In addition, the future Vienna conference will also be a renewed expression of the unified stance of Italy, Austria, and Hungary towards Germany. Regarding this level, the Vienna newspapers unanimously expressed their congratulations. The Vienna News reported, "Mussolini, the Italian Prime Minister, agreed to move the meeting of the foreign ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary from Rome to Vienna, which is tantamount to sending a message to the world that Austria's position is particularly important in solving all problems in Central Europe," and so on.

The United States has refused to join the agreement because radio broadcasting is not under government jurisdiction. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Regarding the mediation of the textile workers' strike in Lille, negotiations have continued since this morning, and labor and management have virtually reached a compromise on the wage issue. It is expected that the first protocol will be signed this afternoon. The purpose of the negotiations between the two sides is twofold: one is to determine the method of electing worker representatives, and the other is to discuss the issue of wage increases. Regarding the former, i.e., the issue of worker representatives, although labor representatives made some concessions this morning, their opinions still differ greatly from those of the management, and there is no hope of a compromise. Therefore, the government representatives decided to discuss the wage issue, and as a result, the management representatives agreed to re-regulate wages in accordance with the current wage levels in other textile regions. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the textile workers' strike in Lille, Prime Minister Léon Blum summoned representatives from both labor and management today to continue mediation. From 5:00 PM today, representatives from the government, employers, and employees held a meeting at the prefecture of the Nord department for negotiations. Those attending on behalf of the government were Prime Minister Léon Blum, Minister without Portfolio Jouhaux, and Interior Minister Salengro. The delegation of textile employers in Lille was led by Thilliez, President of the Textile Industry Association, and the delegation of employees was led by Dumoulin, Secretary of the Nord Department Labor Union. At 9:45 PM, the Interior Minister told the press, "We have met with the employer and employee delegations successively, and have now met with the employer delegation for the second time. The talks are largely over. From now on, labor and management representatives can negotiate together. The point of contention between the two sides lies entirely in the wage issue." At 10:00 PM, the employers held their own meeting for discussion, and at 11:10 PM, they left the prefecture. The employee delegation then also withdrew, and Dumoulin told the press that the workers hoped to negotiate face-to-face with the employers tomorrow, but "this is only a hope." As for whether the two sides can reach an agreement, it will be known after the government solicits 20,000 opinions. Subsequently, government ministers also left the prefecture, but did not issue a statement. As it stands, although negotiations are still underway, they will not be resolved tonight. It is reported that the workers previously demanded a 20% wage increase, but have now retreated to 10%. Whether the employers can accept this is still unknown. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the mediation of the textile workers' strike in Lille, negotiations resumed at 9:30 AM this morning. The labor representatives were received by Minister without Portfolio Jouhaux, and the management representatives were received by Interior Minister Salengro, but Prime Minister Léon Blum did not participate. Thilliez, the leader of the management delegation, told the press, "This dispute is actually about the struggle for authority. The striking workers occupy factories and offices, and at the same time hold demonstrations, all of which are detrimental to our authority, status, and independence. These three are indispensable for managing factories. In short, the management has two preconditions before discussing the wage increase issue: (1) Workers are not allowed to occupy factories and offices again in the future; (2) The method of electing worker representatives and their rights and obligations must be stipulated, so that the employer's authority can be fully maintained."

<h3 id="e50">French North and South Pole Exploration Ship Sinks off the Coast of Iceland; Only One Survivor <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Copenhagen: According to a wireless message from Scoresby Sund, Greenland, the French Arctic exploration ship "Pourquoi-Pas?" sank in a storm off the coast of Iceland. All crew members except one perished, totaling 30 victims. The captain of the expedition, the famous North and South Pole explorer Charcot, was also among them. All bodies were washed away by the waves and could not be recovered. Details are still unknown. The discovery was made by the Danish Navy patrol ship "Thetis." The ship, departing from the capital of Iceland, was patrolling the waters of Straumnesfjord, not far from the location of the "Pourquoi-Pas?" disaster. They saw a broken ship's mast sticking out of the sea, so they approached to investigate, and discovered that it was the French exploration ship "Pourquoi-Pas?". No one was climbing on the top of the mast, indicating that all crew members had perished. Only one person survived. He drifted at sea holding a piece of wood from the ship and eventually reached the shore. At that time, he was unconscious and was carried on a stretcher to a nearby farmhouse. After drinking coffee, he regained consciousness slightly, and then immediately fell asleep. He has not yet awakened, so his name and the details of the disaster are currently impossible to ascertain. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: Regarding the sinking of the French Arctic exploration ship "Pourquoi-Pas?" off the coast of Iceland, it is now known that the disaster site was indeed in Straumsfjord. Twenty-one bodies of the crew members have washed up on the coast, including the body of the captain, the famous North and South Pole explorer Dr. Charcot. Only one of the crew members survived, the boatswain, named Guidet. He is now awake. According to him, when the ship sailed to Reykjanes Point, it was suddenly hit by a giant storm from the southwest. They immediately turned the rudder to retreat, but lost their way. Until 5:30 AM yesterday morning, it ran aground on a reef. At that time, the sea was stormy, and there was no time to launch the lifeboats. The deck was immediately flooded, and the boiler exploded. The French consul here stated that the ship had a total of 40 crew members. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Saint-Malo: The Arctic Ocean exploration ship "Pourquoi-Pas?", which sank in the Icelandic waters, was registered in the French port of Saint-Malo. The owner and captain was the famous explorer Dr. Charcot. The ship was built in 1908. It was a wooden motorboat, equipped with sails, 140 meters long, 31 meters wide, and 15 meters deep. The ship left the port of Saint-Servan near here on June 22, via Sweden, carrying one member of the Swedish exploration team, and then sailed to the Greenland area to conduct scientific research. Afterward, the ship was originally scheduled to sail to Scoresby Sund to meet with members of the French exploration team who landed there in 1935, but unexpectedly encountered danger and sank on the way. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The academic community is deeply saddened by the news of the sinking of the famous French North and South Pole explorer Dr. Charcot, along with his famous exploration ship "Pourquoi-Pas?", in the waters near Iceland. Dr. Charcot was born in 1867 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. His father was a doctor, and Charcot initially followed his father's profession as a doctor, but later became known as an "explorer." The exploration ships he captained were initially the "Français" and later the "Pourquoi-Pas?". From 1903 to 1905 and from 1908 to 1910, he went to Antarctica twice to conduct oceanographic research and map the Antarctic continent completely, thus gaining fame. Later, a place on the Antarctic continent was named after Charcot. Afterward, Charcot conducted several explorations in the North Atlantic. His explorations were compiled into several volumes, including "Voyage to Antarctica" and "The Pourquoi-Pas? Expedition." Despite being in his seventies, he never ceased to travel to the far seas for exploration. Charcot served successively as the Director of the Oceanographic Institute, a researcher at the Hydrographic Office, and a member of the Marine Academy. In 1921, he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, and in 1930, he was elected to the Academy of Medicine. He also received medals and awards from the French and foreign governments. He is survived by his wife and two daughters. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The executive committee of the Liberal Party recently held a meeting and passed a resolution with the following main points: "1. The Liberal Party executive committee hereby urges all peace-loving and freedom-loving people to pay close attention. Over the past five years, the situation in our country and the world has become increasingly serious. The dictatorial regimes of fascism and communism are becoming increasingly rampant, while democratic governance and basic civil rights such as freedom of thought and freedom of speech are under increasing threat. The current Spanish rebels, with the support of fascist countries, are seeking to overthrow the democratically elected constitutional government of Spain, while influential figures in the British press and the Conservative Party are actually abetting the wrongdoing. If the rebels were to win, dictatorial politics would henceforth dominate all of Europe, and France would inevitably be surrounded on three sides. All of this is due to the weakness, timidity, and indecisiveness of democratic governments, which have failed to strongly support the League of Nations, leading to this situation. The Liberal Party executive committee hereby advocates exerting the strongest pressure on Portugal to ensure that the import of weapons into Spain is effectively prohibited. In addition, various methods should be used to ensure that airplanes manufactured in the United States do not indirectly enter Spain," and so on. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The News Chronicle recently reported that the executive committee of the opposition Labor Party is scheduled to meet tomorrow and is expected to make a surprising decision, declaring that it will no longer oppose the cabinet's military expansion plan. The report stated, "Tomorrow's order will prove that the opposition and the cabinet have good prospects for forming a unified front on the issue of national defense. However, this will be subject to three conditions: (1) The cabinet must continue to strive to promote the collective security system; (2) The solution to the general European problem should not exclude Soviet Russia; (3) The cabinet must prevent harsh treatment and exploitation of laborers when implementing the military expansion plan. At a time when the fascist faction is doing its best to gain military superiority, the majority of people, who have always opposed military expansion, cannot but change their minds. However, military expansion can only be carried out in one way. The Labor Party will proclaim to the government authorities, 'Our party can support the military expansion plan, but only on the condition that you can provide us with guarantees regarding foreign policy. In other words, you must adopt a positive attitude towards international events and uphold collective principles. If you can provide this guarantee, our party will support the military expansion and recruitment of new soldiers with 100% enthusiasm. If a war were to break out due to the implementation of collective security principles, our party is willing to fully support the government in terms of labor and ammunition supply.' Based on this, it is clear that the Labor Party has considerable power in the last minute regarding the maintenance of peace." (17th Havas Telegram)</p>

The calculation is as follows: 100 for paddy fields in 1931, 100 for flat land, and 100 for mountainous land; 95 for paddy fields in 1932, 93 for flat land, and 94 for mountainous land; 89 for paddy fields in 1933, 87 for flat land, and 88 for mountainous land; 82 for paddy fields in 1934, 83 for flat land, and 82 for mountainous land; 81 for paddy fields in 1935, 83 for flat land, and 82 for mountainous land. According to the station's observation of the above figures, land prices have been declining year by year since 1931, and only began to stabilize in 1935. However, compared with 1931, they are still about 18% lower. The reason for this is that there have been frequent droughts and floods in the past five years, and the Communist bandits have been causing trouble, so there has been a great downward trend. Now that domestic politics are gradually becoming stable, the Communist bandits have been largely eliminated, and farmers have been able to live and work in peace. In the future, rural land prices will naturally tend to rebound. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e68">How to Promote Rural Sideline Occupations (Part 1) <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Tianhe, Deputy Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station</p>
<p>1.  What are Rural Sideline Occupations?</p>
<p>Before explaining what rural sideline occupations are, let's first talk about what we call sideline occupations. Sideline occupations themselves do not have a fixed standard, but are relative terms to principal occupations. Generally speaking, it refers to engaging in a certain occupation as the central enterprise for one's livelihood, and then using the remaining time and labor to engage in other occupations to increase income and supplement the insufficiency of one's central enterprise. These other occupations are sideline occupations, and the central enterprise for one's livelihood is the principal occupation. For example, a plasterer usually works when there is work, and pulls a rickshaw when there is no work. Pulling a rickshaw is a sideline occupation, and working as a plasterer is the principal occupation. Another example is a bank clerk who usually serves and works in the bank, which is the principal occupation, but in his spare time, he grows some vegetables and horticulture, and after his family enjoys them, he sells the rest to the market to get some profit, which is a sideline occupation.</p>
<p>The so-called rural sideline occupations mean that the central enterprise for one's livelihood must be agriculture, and the people engaged in it must be farmers. Farmers, in addition to engaging in their central enterprise for their livelihood, use their remaining time and labor, or use vacant land and residual materials, or process and manufacture agricultural products to engage in production; or directly sell labor to do short-term work to increase income and supplement the insufficiency of their central enterprise, all of which are called rural sideline occupations. For example, in ordinary rural areas, most farmers cultivate rice and wheat, but planting rice and wheat does not require working all year round, so in the slack farming season, they weave straw sandals, do carpentry, do hawking, and so on. Because rice and wheat cultivation is the central enterprise for their livelihood, it is the principal occupation; weaving straw sandals, doing carpentry, and doing hawking are sideline occupations because they are operated by using spare time and labor. The central enterprise for one's livelihood, planting rice and wheat, is a part of agriculture, and the operators of these sideline occupations are farmers, so it is called rural sideline occupations.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, principal occupations and sideline occupations are two relative terms, which are even more prominent in rural areas. For example, in places with good water conservancy, farmers take rice cultivation as their principal occupation, and rope making and fishing as their sideline occupations; in seaside fishing villages, most of the labor is used to operate the fishing industry, and all the remaining labor is used for cultivation; even in the same village, it is a sideline occupation for household A, but a principal occupation for household B, so the principal occupation and sideline occupation cannot be definitively judged on the basis of the enterprise itself.</p>
<p>Moreover, rural sideline occupations are easily transformed by environmental changes and the encroachment of external forces: for example, in a certain place, most farmers originally took earthwork, woodwork, and sewing as their sideline occupations, but in recent years, due to rural economic bankruptcy and local unrest, etc., those with money have moved into the city, and the remaining poor people cannot afford to build houses or make clothes. Therefore, these earthworkers, carpenters, and tailors have no work to do, and have to change to other sideline occupations to supplement the insufficiency of their principal occupations. For example, the farmers in a certain place used to weave straw sandals as a sideline occupation, but now there is a new job of weaving straw hats, which is more profitable than straw sandals. Therefore, the farmers who used to weave straw sandals as a sideline occupation are now changing to weaving straw hats as a sideline occupation. Furthermore, if the market demand for a certain sideline occupation's products increases significantly, this sideline occupation will become particularly developed; conversely, it will gradually decline, or even disappear. Therefore, rural sideline occupations are constantly changing, constantly rising and falling.</p>
<p>2.  Why Promote Rural Sideline Occupations?</p>
<p>(1) Insufficient Cultivated Land In the past, we always said that our country is "vast in territory and rich in resources", but after investigation and statistics, we know that the land is indeed very large, but not all of this vast land is suitable for cultivation. According to Mr. Weng Wenhao: "Due to geographical restrictions, most places in China are not suitable for human life, or cannot accommodate a large population. The Chinese people have to concentrate in a small number of places: (1) the North China Plain (the plains of the Bai River, Yellow River, and Huai River), (2) the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain, (3) the hills near the above plains, (4) the southeastern coastal areas of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, (5) the Sichuan Basin. The total area of the above five regions is 700,000 square miles, accounting for less than 17% of the national area, while the population is 350 million, accounting for more than 83% of the national population, with a total average density of more than 500 people per square mile, far above Japan and Germany, close to the Netherlands, and the population density in the Central Plains and Yangtze regions is even higher than that of the United Kingdom and Belgium, which have the highest population densities in the world. According to the above population density and 4,000 mu per square mile, the area of land that each person can share is 6 mu per person in the Central Plains region, 4.7 mu per person in the Yangtze region, 11 mu per person in the hilly and southeastern coastal regions, and 6.5 mu per person in the Sichuan Basin, with a total average of 6.5 mu per person (as for the regions where each person shares more mu, it is not that the people there are richer, but because the land there is not good). Moreover, in fact, the land that each person gets is not all cultivable, because the above-mentioned mu includes a lot of mountains, lakes, rivers, residences, roads and other areas. If we calculate only from the cultivated land, each person gets only 3 mu of land at most." (Independent Review, Issue 3)</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the estimates of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, which shows that the area of land managed by Chinese farm households is mostly below 10 mu, accounting for 36% of the total number of farm households, followed by 10 mu to 20 mu, accounting for 14%, and 30 mu to 50 mu, accounting for 8%; further, looking at these figures as a whole, farm households below 20 mu account for 61% of the total number of farm households. If each family is calculated with 5 people, then the cultivated land area per person is slightly less than 4 mu, which is roughly the same as Mr. Weng's estimated number. (Detailed estimates are published in the Agricultural Intelligence Report, Year 3, Issue 4)</p>
<p>From the above two estimates, each farmer has an average of only 3 to 4 mu of cultivated land, and all food and clothing must be obtained from it. No matter how land policy experts improve land distribution, the land will not grow more. No matter how agricultural experts improve cultivation methods, it is difficult to produce the output of two mu of land from one mu. Even if one mu can produce the output of two mu of land, each person will only get 6 or 7 mu, which is not enough to maintain a livelihood. According to experts, a farmer needs about 40 mu of cultivated land to maintain a decent life. Therefore, the shortage of cultivated land in our country has reached its extreme. Farmers cannot maintain their livelihoods without seeking remedies from sideline occupations. This is the first reason to promote rural sideline occupations.</p>
<p>(2) Surplus Labor As mentioned above, 150 million farmers are housed in an area of 700,000 square miles. There is little land and a large population, so there is a lot of spare time every year. According to the survey and estimation of Mr. Buck, a professor at Jinling University, the actual time that Chinese farmers spend on crop production each year, if each farmer works 10 hours a day, only needs three months to complete. The remaining nine months are partly wasted. For example, when selling agricultural products, everyone does not try to unite and transport them by boat or truck, but carries them into the city one by one. This not only costs mental and physical labor, but also wastes time, which is really a pity. Part of the time is spent on improper entertainment such as sitting in tea shops and gambling because there is no suitable work to do. Therefore, if so much surplus labor is not used for sideline occupations to increase their income, it will have a great impact on farmers' livelihoods and local order. This is the second reason to promote rural sideline occupations.</p>
<p>(3) Utilization of Residual Materials and Vacant Land As the saying goes, even bricks and wood scraps are useful. Especially in rural areas, there is simply nothing that cannot be used. For example, using green grass from the fields to raise cattle and sheep, which can be sold for money when they grow up, and the manure of cattle and sheep can be used to fertilize the fields, is a very good sideline occupation. We all use mulberry stalks as fuel, but mulberry bark can be used to make paper, which can be peeled off during the slack farming season, or made by oneself, or made together, or even sold to paper mills to increase income. These are all common people who neglect to use residual materials as sideline occupations.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Philippine Congress's Bill to Restrict Foreign Business Greatly Affects Overseas Chinese Commerce and Employment The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Has Lodged an Objection <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: There are more than 140,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, most of whom are from southern Fujian. They actually control a very large economic power, and the merchants in the business occupy an absolute advantage. Therefore, the Philippine government is trying its best to restrict the business of overseas Chinese. After the independence of the Philippines, it will tend to be active. Although it is nominally said to restrict foreign merchants, in fact, overseas Chinese account for the largest number of foreign merchants and are also the most powerful. It is tantamount to restricting overseas Chinese only. Li Qingquan, chairman of the Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and member of the Fujian Provincial Government, arrived in Xiamen on the 13th via Hong Kong, took the Haitan to Xiamen, and stayed at his private residence on Qizhishan, Gulangyu. According to him, "After the independence of the Philippines, the Philippine government is also actively seeking self-sufficiency in the economic field, so it imposes considerable restrictions on foreign businesses. There are many such proposals in the current session of the House of Representatives, many of which are unfavorable to foreign merchants. Although it is not limited to overseas Chinese, the overseas Chinese in the Philippine business market account for a large part of the power. Therefore, what is unfavorable to foreign merchants is unfavorable to overseas Chinese. This time, I am the chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, and I love to represent the overseas Chinese in the Philippines to raise objections to the Philippine government, (1) Foreign shops that need ten shop assistants can only use two of their own nationals, and the remaining eight must use Filipinos or Americans, and so on proportionally (2) Restricting the number of foreign workers (3) Registering foreign nationals, each person must pay a license fee of 20 Philippine silver dollars (4) Retailers in various places will be operated by non-Filipinos (5) Shop bookkeeping will be changed to Filipino, Spanish, or English This number is related to the lifeblood of overseas Chinese businesses. The purpose of the Philippine government is nothing more than to find a way out for the Filipino people and reduce unemployment. If its various plans are realized, the number of unemployed overseas Chinese will greatly increase, and commerce will also be greatly affected. Now, in addition to the Chamber of Commerce raising objections, I have also explained the reasons to the Philippine authorities in detail and asked them to carefully consider them. The cases have not yet been approved by the Philippine President. It would be fortunate if they could be cancelled." According to the above points, if they are realized, not only will 80-90% of the unemployed overseas Chinese workers reach that level, but the impact on the entire overseas Chinese business will also be extremely great. The Filipinos are inferior to the overseas Chinese in terms of hard work and agility. They cannot compete with the overseas Chinese in terms of industry and commerce. If Filipinos are used instead of employees, shops will also feel a decrease in work efficiency, and the majority of retailers in the entire Philippines are controlled by overseas Chinese. Once business is prohibited, business will largely be at a standstill, and wholesalers will not be able to operate. As for changing bookkeeping to Filipino, Spanish, and English, it is inevitable that foreign accountants must be hired, which is difficult in terms of economy, work, and habits. All of this is related to the entire fate of overseas Chinese businesses and is absolutely unbearable. (September 16)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Decline of the Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi The Ministry of Industry Plans to Improve It <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The porcelain of Jingdezhen, Jiangxi has always been one of the national industries of our country. Even from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, at its peak, there were as many as 150,000 workers directly engaged in the porcelain industry out of a population of 280,000, and the annual output was as high as 15-16 million yuan. Now, due to backward technology, encroachment by foreign porcelain, and years of bandit disasters, production and sales have plummeted. According to people in Jingdezhen who are familiar with the porcelain industry, there are only more than 10,000 people engaged in the porcelain industry now, with an annual output of 4-5 million yuan. More than half of the kiln households have closed down, and those who barely support themselves are also intermittent and struggling to survive. The biggest reasons for its failure are as follows: (1) In terms of raw materials, various porcelain clays are far away in Xingzi, Wuyuan, Qimen, Guixi, Leping, Yugan, and Linchuan, making transportation inconvenient. The materials are also not fine enough, and the composition is difficult to be accurate. The production of pine firewood and charcoal for fuel is limited, and the cost is too expensive. (2) In terms of manufacturing, sticking to old rules and not knowing how to use machinery, and the sagger for holding porcelain is often collapsed because it is not resistant to high heat, which is also a fatal injury. (3) Goods focus on aristocratic works of art, while neglecting civilian daily necessities, so that domestic daily necessities are almost entirely occupied by foreign porcelain. (4) In terms of business, lack of capital, slow transportation and sales, coupled with the competition of gangs, the control of workers, and bad habits are also the reasons for failure. In recent years, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Industry, and the industrial and financial circles have had improvement plans, but they are limited by resources and are also talking on paper. This time, Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang visited Jingdezhen and found that the porcelain industry in the area was so dying that not only was the loss to Jiangxi Province too great, but also the national tax was greatly affected. He decided to report to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate huge sums of money to be handled by the Ministry of Industry in conjunction with the Jiangxi Construction Department to handle improvement matters, and plans to first set up a raw material refining plant for mass production. The capital is divided equally between the province and the country, and the Pottery Bureau has started to carry out this project.</p>
<p>The Guangda Porcelain Company, initiated by the Provincial Government and various industrial circles, has a capital of 1.8 million yuan, and various parties have enthusiastically subscribed for shares. The factory is located in Jiujiang. However, the manager, Du Chongyuan, was imprisoned for hindering foreign relations, and the project was suspended in the middle. The construction of the Xun factory site is about to be completed, and Du has also been released from prison in Shanghai and has come to Xun. He plans to build high-temperature kilns and install instruments and machinery. It is expected that preparations will be completed by the beginning of next spring. The factory will be a completely mechanized industry, refining civilian daily necessities to resist imports, so that the Jingdezhen porcelain industry can gradually develop.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Fujian Province The Initial Stage of Land Consolidation is Completed The First Phase of Five Counties Has Been Completed The Number of Fields in Longxi and Nan'an Has Increased Several Times <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The collection of field taxes in Fujian Province is still based on the customs of the former Qing Dynasty. The grain series and Ding quota still follow the old customs of many years ago. Therefore, there are often malpractices of grain without land or land without grain. The total cultivated land in the province is estimated to be 20 million mu, but the annual field tax revenue is only 2 million. In fact, the Ding grain surcharge paid by the people is more than one yuan per mu, or even two yuan, which has become an image of official and civilian interaction. In recent years, the financial situation of Fujian Province has been extremely difficult, and there is a lack of ways to increase revenue. The provincial government has therefore carried out land consolidation. It is estimated that if the consolidation is successful, the annual field tax revenue can reach 20 million yuan based on an average of one yuan per mu for 20 million mu in the province. At present, the total revenue of local taxes in Fujian Province is only more than 7 million yuan per year. Land consolidation began last year, and it was hosted by the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering the county governments to handle land reports. However, the results reported are mostly inconsistent with the actual number of mu in each county. Now, the provincial government has specially ordered the Land Administration Bureau to handle the consolidation of the ten land areas, and designated the first phase to consolidate the five counties of Longxi, Nan'an, Yongchun, Huian, and Xianyou first. It started in April this year and was limited to five months. The end of August has been reached. The provincial government sent several land inspection officers to the south to inspect. Gan Zanxu inspected the two counties of Longxi and Nan'an. After Wang completed the inspection, he arrived in Xiamen from Zhangzhou on the 13th. According to him, the inspection results showed that the two counties of Xixi and Jing had increased by more than 10,000 after consolidation compared with the people's hall's investigation and report last year. The former Longxi had only 60,000 to 70,000 mu, but now it has increased three times, reaching more than 200,000 mu, and Nan'an has increased four times, reaching more than 140,000 mu. The reported number of mu and the actual number of mu in Longxi accounted for 80%, and Nan'an accounted for 85% to 90%. The results are really impressive. Now, Nan'an's register can be completed by the end of the month, and Longxi will also stop reporting. The entire project can be completed by the end of October. As for the field tax and Ding grain, Longxi levied 1.2 yuan per mu before consolidation and Nan'an levied 80 cents. After consolidation, Longxi can be reduced to less than one yuan, and Nan'an can be reduced to less than 70 cents. In the future, the Land Reporting Office of each county government and local gentry organizations will be responsible for handling the tax evaluation committee. (September 16)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Huai River Guidance Association is Building the Honghukou Movable Dam <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>After completion, giant ships can reach Bengbu Bengbu Communication: The Huai River Guidance Association's plan to guide and control the Huai River in recent years is to separate the Yangtze and Huai Rivers into the sea, which is based on the theories of predecessors and the results of on-the-spot surveys as the standard. Its purpose is nothing more than to prevent floods, facilitate shipping, and irrigate farmland. As for the principle of guiding the Huai River, the first priority is to dredge the waterway into the Yangtze River, and use Gongze Lake as a flood control reservoir to regulate floods. The waterway into the Yangtze River is 153 kilometers long. The route goes from Hongze Lake through Sanhe to Jingou Town, turns into Baijiajian, heads to Gaoyou Lake and Tangjia Lake, and then opens a new river, reaches Shaobo Lake from Nanhu, and reaches Liuzha, passes through the canal, and goes out of the Guijiang diversion rivers, taking the Mangdao River and Liaojiagou to Sanjiangying to enter the Yangtze River. It is expected that before excavating the waterway into the Yangtze River, the Sanhe Movable Dam at the mouth of Hongze Lake must be built, and the Honghu Dike and ship lock and spillway gate must be built to control the water volume and make it a navigation channel. Hongze Lake is the water storage area in the lower reaches of the Huai River, and it has the effect of controlling the flow of the Huai River. When preparing to build the movable dam, an engineering bureau was set up in Jiangba to take special responsibility. It is learned that this construction project is contracted by Shanghai Fuxiji Construction Factory. The entire dam is 750 meters long, with 60 holes, each hole is 18 feet wide and 5.5 meters high. The foundation is made of concrete, and the doors are made of steel. Each one can be opened and closed freely, requiring a cost of 3.5 million yuan. Since the start of construction last spring, earthwork engineering has been started first. The earthwork is a total of 5 million cubic meters, of which 800,000 cubic meters have been completed and are still in progress. A total of 17,000 people are working every day, divided into day and night shifts. By the end of June next year, the earthwork engineering can be completed. Piling engineering has now started and will be completed by October next year, and then concrete work will be implemented. The movable dam project can be completed by the end of 1937. In the future, the water level of Honghu can be adjusted at any time. When there is flooding, it will discharge floodwater into the sea. The initial discharge rate is 1,000 to 1,500 cubic meters per second, and it will gradually expand in the future. When there is drought, it will control the flood flow to facilitate irrigation. Both Huai shipping and navigation will benefit from it. Giant ships with a draft of 2 meters and a capacity of 900 tons can sail from the Yangtze River to Sanjiangying, enter Zhangfu River through the Shaobo Huaiyin two ship locks, cross Gong Lake, and pass through the Huai River, and can directly reach Bengbu Huaiyuan and other ports.</p>

<p>Small Kunshan Militia Dispute</p>
<p>In Songjiang's Small Kunshan, a dispute arose among the stout men of Dapu Port Village over uniform issues, leading to the destruction of the Small Kunshan Public Security Patrol Station by a crowd and minor injuries to the police chief. Afterwards, Public Security Bureau Chief He Runzhang went to reprimand them, and the stout men resumed their work as usual. Subsequently, County Magistrate Li, considering Yu Fengliang, the chief of the ninth bao of the town, Chen Shixiong, the chief of the second jia of the sixth bao, and farmers Chen Shichang, Shi Lanbo, Xu Musheng, Shi Qin-yu, Yu Deyun, Yu Defu, Xu Rentang, Xu Youtang, Xu Xiangzhou, and village women Xu Xia-shi and Yu Peng-shi, a total of thirteen individuals, as the core members of this riot, specifically ordered Fei Gongxia, the captain of the water patrol team, to arrest and deliver them separately within three days of receiving the order. Captain Fei then led patrol officers, twenty policemen, and security team soldiers, taking boats down to the village to conduct a sweeping arrest. For a time, villagers fled in all directions, and they gained nothing. Afterwards, Yu Defu, also known as Yu Dehu, was successively captured in Songjiang, and after interrogation by the local court, he was released on bail. Recently, Xu Xiangzhou was also arrested, while the remaining criminals are still being pursued. It is now known that Lu Shunong and others from Songjiang residing in Beijing, concerned that the reported arrest of as many as thirteen ringleaders might have widespread implications and affect agricultural affairs, have specially sent a letter to County Magistrate Li appealing to him, wondering if the authorities can understand the hardship of farming and avoid implicating others.</p>

<p>Sheep Thief Strangles Housewife</p>
<p>In Huanglou Village, Third District, an elderly woman, Yao Sun-shi, made a living by raising sheep. The night before, a thief broke into her house, intending to steal three sheep. When she discovered him, she loudly shouted for the thief to be caught. Due to living alone, no one came to her aid at the time. The thief, annoyed by her incessant shouting, untied her belt and strangled her to death, then covered her head with a water vat and fled. Yesterday, someone discovered the body and reported it to the district office, which in turn reported it to the county government. The county government dispatched Inspector Li Qingping of the Fourth Sub-station of the Zhuqiao Public Security Bureau, along with a clerk, to conduct an examination, which confirmed the facts. A report has been submitted to apprehend the murderer for further investigation.</p>

<p>Hupu Captures Fugitive Criminal</p>
<p>Jin Changkun, a man from out of town, has lived in Hupu Town in this county for a long time. Recently, his nephew reported him for trafficking in a large number of smuggled rayon. The Hupu water police team arrested Jin and sent him to the county. An investigation revealed that Jin had colluded with Shen Sandi and others to rob the Jiu Da Cloth Factory in Hongkou, Shanghai. The latter had already been arrested, but Jin was still hiding here in Hupu. According to his nephew's original report, "Jin Changkun has been hiding in Laichang since the Shanghai case. He lives in Hupu along the river and specializes in trafficking in smuggled goods near Haimen and Chongming. On one occasion, he transported 180 dan of smuggled rayon, packed in sacks, and peddled it around Xu Liujing, making thousands of dollars in profit." Therefore, after Jin was captured, he was sent to the county government. After judicial interrogation, Jin claimed to be from Shandong and had been living in Hupu for a long time, working as a fisherman and loading goods for customers, and he did not engage in the trafficking of smuggled goods. When questioned about the robbery of the Jiu Da Factory in Hongkou, Shanghai, he denied it even more, saying that this was actually his nephew making false accusations because he had failed to get a loan. As a result, he was ordered to be detained pending investigation.</p>

<p>Yubao Journalists Come to Wuxi to Petition</p>
<p>The Changshu Telegraph Daily was destroyed by Zhou Tongzhi, the leader of the First Squad of the First Company of the Tenth Security Brigade stationed in Changshu. This was due to a news report on the 7th and 8th of this month about a "brawl at the Dongfang Tea House", which involved security team soldiers. Zhou led forty soldiers to the newspaper office. Five reporters were injured at the time. After the incident, Wang Zipei was dispatched twice by the special commissioner to Changshu to investigate, ordering that Zhou Tongzhi be placed under supervision. Zheng Faxin, the deputy brigade commander, escorted Zhou to Wuxi. After the special commissioner reviewed the case, he ordered him to be detained pending investigation. However, the telegraph office, due to the destruction of the office buildings, was unable to work and live there. Yesterday, a special representative was sent to Wuxi to visit Special Commissioner Zang, requesting a swift resolution to the case and strict punishment of the perpetrators. At the same time, Zhou Zhimie of the Xinsheng Daily and Feng Xiaonong of the Daily News in the county also jointly went to the special commissioner's office to petition for relief. Section Chief Sheng met with the petition representatives and replied that Special Commissioner Zang was paying close attention to the case and would handle it fairly according to the law in order to protect public opinion. Zhou and others were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Pump Explosion Tragedy</p>
<p>Yang A-da from Dangkou, Eighth District, used to operate a sweet dew-carrying boat to Wuxi, and also had a water pumping boat. His brothers, Yang Jinsheng and Qiaosheng, were both engaged in farming. Jinsheng's son, A-jin, 22 years old, and Qiaosheng's son, Shigen, 18 years old, helped out with pumping water when they were not busy with farming. A week ago, A-jin and Shigen sailed the boat to the city alone, to the Yongxing Machine Factory in Qiantai Ping Lane outside Guangfu Gate to fit machine parts. Yesterday (the 17th), they were ready to return home. At about 10 a.m., A-jin lit the pump lamp and fired up the engine. The lamp exploded suddenly because the air pressure was too high, and the fire spread to the kerosene tank, causing the entire boat to be engulfed in flames. At that moment, A-jin was in the cabin and Shigen was lying in the boat shed, taking the full impact. Unable to escape, they were burned all over, their skin charred and their flesh roasted. They jumped into the river. Employees from the factory drew water to extinguish the fire. As a result, the machine boat and an ox were burned. The injured men were rescued, carried to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the burns, they were barely alive and their lives were in danger. In the afternoon, the factory sent a special representative to the village to report to their families to come to the city to take care of everything.</p>

<p>Hall Commissioner Surveys Zhongxing Wharf</p>
<p>Cheng Xu, a member of the Executive Committee of the Jingjiang County Party Department, reported that the Zhongxing Coal Stack wharf in Huangtiangang, north of Jiangyin, protruded into the center of the river, causing the water flow to shift northward, resulting in severe and increasing collapses of the dikes north of the river. This seriously endangered the area. On July 27 of this year, he sent a telegram on behalf of the provincial construction hall, ordering the Jiangyin county government to order the Zhongxing Wharf Company to dismantle and shrink the wharf in order to smooth the river flow. Director Shen of the hall, believing that the dispute should be resolved as soon as possible, commissioned Guidance Engineer Zhou Kebo to come to Cheng the day before yesterday to meet with the county magistrates of Jiangyin and Jingjiang to convene local figures from the two counties to discuss. On the afternoon of the 16th, Commissioner Zhou went to the wharf north of the city to conduct an inspection and survey, and then crossed the river to inspect the Shixu Port. He returned to the county at about 4 p.m. for a discussion to study the matter in detail, finding that the Zhongxing Wharf did not obstruct the collapse of the dikes north of the river. He will report this fact to the Construction Hall for review.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Zhejiang Local Bank Handles Agricultural Loans <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Cooperation, Seedling, Storage and Pledge, etc.; Total Loan of 3.81 Million</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Zhejiang Local Bank, in view of the increasingly dilapidated rural economy, the depletion of agricultural resources, and the increasingly difficult livelihood of farmers, has specially set up an Agricultural and Industrial Loan Department to be responsible for handling agricultural and small-scale industrial loans. Since its establishment, it has achieved considerable results. A visit and report are as follows:</p>
<p>Agricultural Cooperative Loans</p>
<p>To help rural areas, such as by using a cooperative system to lay its foundation, there will be no worries about capital concentration, and there will be fair distribution. Its prosperity and growth can be expected while standing firm. Therefore, agricultural financial institutions have always targeted rural cooperatives to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The handling of rural cooperatives in our country dates back more than ten years. After the Northern Expedition, rural credit cooperatives in various provinces were organized one after another. However, due to the poor rural environment and the lack of knowledge among farmers in our country, there are still not many cooperatives that are well-organized and whose members understand the true meaning of cooperation. In this situation, it seems insufficient in both quantity and quality to rely solely on cooperative organizations to regulate the rural economy. From the beginning, our bank has advocated lending to cooperatives and stipulated that lending to farmers' cooperatives should be the principle of agricultural lending. However, due to the above-mentioned reasons, coupled with the fact that many cooperatives in Zhejiang Province have close relationships with local agricultural financial institutions, the promotion of cooperative loan business seems to be slightly slow. However, when cooperatives need larger loans or need funds to carry out special businesses, they often borrow from our bank. In the past year, in addition to lending to agricultural financial institutions in various places for re-lending to cooperatives, the amount of direct lending to cooperatives has reached more than 284,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Agricultural Seedling Loans</p>
<p>Seedling loans are the first step to increase farmers' production and promote agricultural improvement. They are deeply and significantly related to agriculture. When farmers are plowing and planting in the spring, they often have to make do with whatever is available due to lack of funds when it comes to the selection of seeds and fertilizers, as well as the equipment for farming tools and machinery, making it difficult to expect a good harvest. After a disastrous year, there are also many places where poverty has reached the point where they cannot even sow seeds. Under these circumstances, if there are no financial institutions that provide low-interest loans for turnover, the general farmers will inevitably still rely on the old-fashioned high-interest loans, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and the harm will be even deeper, which will further plunge the rural areas into a state of collapse. Our bank is keenly aware of this and has spared no effort in promoting agricultural seedling loans, conducting trials in more than ten places such as Yuqian, Ningbo, and Hangzhou counties, and the results have been quite good. Farmers have been able to use the loans for production and repay them on time without any arrears. As of the end of June this year, the total amount of loans issued for this item was more than 227,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Agricultural Warehouse Storage Pledge Loans</p>
<p>Agricultural warehouse storage pledge loans are the most important and the largest in our bank's agricultural loans. The reason is that our bank has more than 50 branches, spread across all important cities and towns in the province, most of which have warehouses, making it very convenient to handle this business. Whenever the agricultural products are harvested, the prices tend to fall. Farmers who need funds can store and pledge rice, beans, wheat, etc. to the bank. The procedures are simple and the benefits are numerous. In the past year, the total amount of loans issued was more than 3,005,000 yuan. In addition, loans are also given to agricultural warehouses run by agricultural financial institutions in various counties as working capital for storing rice and grain. Our bank can also do its part to guide and assist, and the results have been quite good.</p>
<p>Scattered Movable Property Pledge</p>
<p>In recent years, the need for financial regulation in rural areas has become extremely urgent. However, the organization of cooperatives, the target of loans, is difficult to maintain, resulting in financial institutions' efforts to promote loans to rural areas, although they have done their best, have not achieved universal success. Based on our past experience, we deeply know that farmers are quite able to abide by credit. Unless it is absolutely necessary, they will never deny or delay the debts they owe. Therefore, we cannot deny them the opportunity to obtain loans simply because they do not have a cooperative organization. The only way to remedy this is to conduct pawn-style rural scattered movable property pledge loans, in order to achieve the purpose of relief. The scope of collateral for this loan includes clothing, gold and silver, copper and iron utensils, as well as raw materials and seeds. These types of pledges are owned by most farmers. In the past, they could be pledged to pawnshops at any time for turnover. However, since the inland pawn industry has been hit by the trend in recent years, many pawnshops have been unable to maintain their operations and have closed down. Even those who can barely maintain their operations have tightened their terms (i.e., deductions from the pledged price) and closed their doors (i.e., limiting the maximum pledge price to a few yuan and the total amount of loans issued per day to a few hundred yuan), etc., which often occur during financial crunches. The impact on farmers' livelihoods is not insignificant. Therefore, at a time when rural cooperatives have not yet been universally established and the pawn industry is on its last breath, conducting pawn-style rural scattered movable property pledge loans is actually an urgent task to help farmers. In view of this, our bank conducted trials in Huzhou and Lanxi branches and Changxing office in the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic of China. Not only were the farmers satisfied, but they were also able to redeem their goods upon maturity without any loss. In January of the 25th year of the Republic of China, our bank added a Longxi office, and its main task was almost entirely to operate this business. As for Fenghua, Jiashan and other places, they are also surveying houses and will open for business soon. In addition, our bank charges only 1.5% per month for insurance, interest, custody and other expenses for this type of loan, which is considered to be light on the farmers' burden. The total amount of loans pledged for this item, as of the end of June this year, reached 296,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Joint Guarantee Credit</p>
<p>Our bank has always focused on universality and practical results in agricultural lending. For farmers who are diligent, simple, poor, and have not yet joined cooperatives, those who have scattered movable property that can be pledged can pledge loans in accordance with the regulations of our bank on scattered movable property pledge loans. Those who have no movable property to pledge but are honest and diligent are also given the opportunity to obtain loans to enhance their production capacity. This is the purpose of our bank's creation of joint guarantee credit loans. According to the loan method, the borrower only needs to find three guarantors recognized by our bank from among acquaintances (most of whom are farmers) to provide joint guarantee, and then they can apply for a loan. In this way, on the one hand, honest farmers can have the convenience of financial turnover, and on the other hand, they can be made to understand the meaning of joint responsibility, arouse interest in cooperation, and lay the foundation for organizing cooperatives in the future. Currently, trials are being conducted in Lingjiaqiao and other places in Hangzhou County, and a total of more than 5,000 yuan has been issued in loans. Although the amount is not large, the benefits received by tenant farmers are not small, and it can be said to have considerable results. It is now planned to vigorously expand it in order to promote it to other places. The total amount of the above-mentioned rural loans reaches more than 3,818,000 yuan. The geographical distribution covers all important cities and towns in the province. Although the loan methods are different, their purpose of benefiting rural areas is the same.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the income tax on the third category of public bonds and deposit income next month. Because the opening of the tax is imminent, but all the measures have not yet been determined, the banking industry in this city is afraid that it will not be possible to implement it for a while. Therefore, after research by the Banking Association and deliberation by the Executive Committee, it was submitted to the Ministry to extend the implementation to next year. The submitted document was issued yesterday. At the same time, Zhang Peishen and Wang Zhixin were recommended to go to Beijing to attend the meeting of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank and contact Gao Bingfang and Liang Hejing, the director and deputy director of the Preparation Office for Direct Tax of the Ministry of Finance, to explain the difficulties in person. They have returned to Shanghai one after another. It is heard that in order to carry out the work effectively, the office will send experts to Shanghai to discuss with the banking sector in detail whether it can be opened on schedule. It is still impossible to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e89">County Government Prepares to Levy Land Value Tax <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Provisional Measures for Collection Passed Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government, upon order, conducted a pilot land value tax. The Director of the Land Administration Bureau was previously ordered to prepare various procedures, which have been completed. County Magistrate Li, considering that the opening of the tax is approaching and the matter is a pioneering undertaking, all collection methods should invite county party and government agencies, as well as leaders from various districts, to discuss together in order to maximize the benefits. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the county government specially held a land value tax discussion meeting. Wang Chengyao, Zhang Yi, Zhu Changlin, Cao Yiguang, Ge Xiusheng, Zhang Jingye, Yin Xiongfei, Cao Yuanxun, and Secretary Wu and Section Chief He of the county government attended. The meeting was chaired by Li Zhifu (Section Chief He acted on his behalf), and Cao Yuanxun took the minutes. After the salutations, the process of being ordered to conduct a pilot land value tax was reported. Then, a draft of the provisional measures for collecting land value tax was submitted for discussion. After detailed research by the representatives in accordance with laws and regulations, the original proposal was revised and passed. The revised measures are recorded as follows: (1) The land in each district, township, and town of this county shall be subject to land value tax in accordance with the provisions of these measures, and the original agricultural tax shall be abolished.

<h3 id="e90">Tea Production Area Inspection Results Satisfactory; Qihong and Tunlv Concluded One After Another; Inspection Personnel Returned to Shanghai One After Another <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In order to fundamentally improve the quality of Chinese tea and revitalize foreign trade, the National Product Inspection Committee of the Ministry of Industry held tea production area inspections. This year, it started with the Qihong and Tunlv areas first. Qihong has been completed, and Tunlv was also completed on the 15th of this month. The inspection personnel previously entrusted to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to recruit have also returned to Shanghai one after another since August 3, led by Fan Hejun, a member of the Tea Production Area Inspection Committee, to practice in the tea area. According to Fan's report yesterday, the results of this trip were quite good. Fan said that after the end of the Qihong area production area inspection and returning to Shanghai, he was ordered to lead twelve inspection personnel to leave Shanghai on August 3 and rush to Qimen to practice the production of red and green tea. Those who practiced at the Qimen Tea Improvement Center spent fifteen days learning, picking leaves in the morning, explaining theory at noon, and manufacturing on site in the afternoon. They also experienced rural life in the nearby tea areas in order to truly understand the rural economic situation, living habits, and drawbacks. Looking at the situation in the Qihong and Tunlv areas as a whole, the most fundamental drawbacks that affect the future of Chinese tea are several reasons: (1) Due to the high and then low prices in Shanghai, inland tea companies have the bad habit of rushing to produce, resulting in tea farmers' sour, wet, smoky, and sun-dried embryos being rushed to be purchased by tea companies as long as they are early, while high-quality mountain goods and dry embryos are often unable to be sold at a good price because the buds are slower to sprout and they are not in time for the opening of the market. If this is not corrected, the quality of Chinese tea will never be improved. (2) Because tea companies have no fixed form, most of them are established with temporary investment, which has a speculative nature. They cannot unite to operate on a large scale, have no machinery and equipment, do not study and learn, and the cost is increasing and the quality is decreasing, causing a fatal blow to Chinese tea. (3) Due to the legacy of serfdom, it has not been completely eradicated, and the trend of high-interest debt is more serious than in other places. The organization of cooperative undertakings is also hindered by the above-mentioned class system. The above three reasons are based on the perspectives of tea merchants, tea companies, and tea farmers, and are the basic factors for the decline of the tea industry in the area. Now the central and local governments have decided to rectify the foreign trade of Chinese tea and reverse the decline. It is hoped that future facilities and plans will pay close attention to the above points, and then the future of Chinese tea may have the hope of innovation.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency reports that the Shanghai National Assembly Representative Election Office received a letter from the National Assembly Representative Election Office of the Four Northeastern Provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, Province Letter No. 98, which stated, "The case investigation shows that many citizens in the register of citizens residing in the four northeastern provinces sent by Nanjing and other places are affiliated with the military. That is, if a citizen has more than two electoral rights, which election should he participate in? There are no clear regulations in the law. May I, by analogy with the precedent of the third occupational election in Article 5 of the National Assembly Representative Election Law, order him to choose one place by himself? This office has sent a letter to the General Office of the National Assembly Representative Election for interpretation. The reply is now approved, 'The matter of those who have more than two special electoral rights is the same as those who have more than two electoral rights in occupational elections. They can naturally be handled by analogy.' I hereby reply for your information, etc. In addition to sending letters separately, I also request you to check and verify this to Jiang Zuobin, the supervisor of the Shanghai National Assembly Representative Election Office." The reporter notes that the original text of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Election Law is "Those who have more than two electoral rights in occupational elections shall be allowed to choose to be electors of one group." It is also reported that the oath registration of citizens in various public and private institutions in this city is still continuing. In the past few days, the Academia Sinica, the General Management Office of the Bank of China, and the Daxin Company have also held them in turn.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Ministry of Finance Approves That Silver Receipt Has Permanent Nature <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>No Formal Receipt Changed for Years</p>
<p>Should Be Regarded As A Formal Receipt Must Affix Stamps</p>
<p>The Bankers Association notified various banks regarding the issue of stamp duty on silver receipts, saying, "Dear Sirs, The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce recently requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt silver receipts issued by the silver industry from stamp duty because they were temporary in nature. The Ministry of Finance stated that many of these temporary receipts have not been exchanged for formal receipts for years and months in order to avoid tax obligations. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance approved the Chamber of Commerce's request. As a result, the Banking Association, the Stamp Duty Committee, held a meeting to study the matter. It was generally agreed that the temporary receipts commonly used by the industry are mostly for waiting for the payment to be collected or the procedures to be completed, and can be used to exchange for formal receipts or certificates. Their nature is no different from temporary subscription receipts and do not need to be stamped. This is completely different from the point mentioned by the Ministry of Finance that formal receipts have not been exchanged for years and months. If there is such a case, it should be stamped. Afterwards, each colleague should only issue temporary receipts for those who can exchange for formal receipts, certificates, or original documents in a short period of time. The said receipt must also state the words 'for the exchange of receipts, certificates, or original documents' to show the restriction. If all can be handled in accordance with this, it will not conflict with the spirit of the Ministry of Finance's approval and there is no need to affix stamps. Those that are permanent in nature and may not be exchanged for formal receipts for years and months should be regarded as formal receipts and must be stamped in accordance with the law, etc." That is, based on the said resolution, we requested the Association for review. After being submitted to the 12th Executive Committee meeting for discussion, everyone agreed with the measures proposed by the Committee. Accordingly, all banks in the Association are notified that temporary receipts issued in the future should be handled in accordance with the said measures so as not to conflict with the Ministry of Finance's approval. Please check and verify.</p>

<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that South China is adjacent to overseas countries, and the number of overseas Chinese who travel back and forth each year is very large. In addition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureaus already established in Guangzhou and Xiamen, it is still felt that this is insufficient. Therefore, after discussion at the meeting, it was decided to establish a bureau in Jiangmen, Haikou, and Shantou, and three members of the Commission were appointed as directors of the bureau. It is learned that Jiangmen Bureau Director Mai Jinshi went to Guangdong two weeks ago to prepare everything. It can be established after receiving the order.

<h3 id="e98">Eurasia Aviation Corporation Aviation Insurance: 10,000 Yuan Coverage per Passenger, Additional Coverage Available; Simple Procedures, Still in Initial Stages in the Country <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation is offering aviation insurance, as reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, we received a dispatch from Nanjing regarding the insurance procedures, stating that passengers must first apply for insurance, and the premium is an additional 50%. Our reporter went to the company to inquire and learned that the insurance has been implemented since the 1st, and the regulations and premiums differ greatly from the dispatch. The accurate details are recorded below:</p>
<p>10,000 Yuan Coverage per Passenger</p>
<p>The company's contract with the insurance company provides coverage of 10,000 yuan per passenger. The premium is included in the ticket price and borne by the company, so it is a passive insurance in nature. When purchasing a ticket or taking a special flight, or when the company issues an official ticket, the premium is calculated according to the mileage and sent to the insurance company. In the event of an accident, passengers can claim compensation from the company with their ticket. The company has always provided individual insurance for its flight personnel, such as pilots, mechanics, and radio operators. If they are not serving on the original aircraft, they will also be issued a ticket, and the insurance rate is up to 5% of the ticket price.</p>
<p>Stipulated Compensation Conditions</p>
<p>If passengers want to purchase additional insurance, there are also premiums for additional coverage. Calculated for every 10,000 yuan, it is 3 yuan for up to 400 kilometers, 4 yuan for 401 to 1,000 kilometers, and 6 yuan for over 1,000 kilometers. This will also be implemented soon. The compensation conditions are: (1) death due to an airplane accident; (2) total disability due to an airplane accident; (3) injury due to an airplane accident that results in complete inability to work for a short period of time, with a maximum of 10 yuan per day for recuperation expenses. When claiming compensation, in addition to the ticket or ticket stub mentioned above, a certificate from a licensed physician or a certificate from a local official must also be submitted. However, the insurance company reserves the right to appoint its own physician for re-examination. If there are doubts about the claimant's succession rights, the claimant should obtain a confirmation document from the court in accordance with non-contentious event procedures.</p>
<p>Extremely Cautious Handling</p>
<p>Since this insurance is the first time the company has handled it in China, the contact and progress have been very cautious. The aim is to simplify the procedures and keep the premiums low, with the premise of not charging passengers additional premiums. After much negotiation, an agreement was finally reached with the German Xu Qiujia Company. It is now being submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for record, and detailed regulations will be printed and distributed to various branch stations and offices for compliance. After the implementation of this type of insurance, the company's business will surely develop further.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Domestically Produced Real Silk Fabrics: Only Need Certification from Association <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>No longer need to apply to Customs for transportation and sales permits. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Joint Association is convening a second conference on the 26th to discuss methods for transporting and selling silk fabrics. Yesterday, a notice was sent to all members stating: "To our esteemed members, since the Ministry of Finance announced the methods for inspecting imported goods and requiring permits, the railway authorities have also required domestically produced real silk fabrics to have permits before being allowed to be loaded and transported. As a result, real silk goods in Shanghai have been blocked and cannot be transported. After repeated discussions and resolutions by Mr. Wang Jie'an, a standing committee member of this association, with the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway authorities, it has been agreed that domestically produced real silk fabrics do not need Customs transportation and sales permits. Only a certificate from the Shanghai Trade Association proving that they are domestically produced real silk fabrics is required for normal passage. We are specially informing you of this by letter, and we hope that your association will inform all fellow traders. In the future, domestically produced real silk fabrics transported by rail from Shanghai only need a certificate from the Trade Association, and it must be clearly stated that they are 'domestically produced real silk fabrics' to avoid misunderstandings by the railway authorities and detention of the goods. Foreign real silk fabrics still need to obtain Customs transportation and sales permits before they can be transported and sold. Please pay close attention. Furthermore, this association has now scheduled a conference of industry representatives from both provinces on September 26th (Saturday) at 3:00 PM at the association's location at No. 9 Gaodun Street, Shanghai, to discuss important issues. We sincerely hope that your association will send several representatives to attend and participate in the discussions and resolutions, and implement them. We eagerly await your arrival."</p>

<h3 id="e102">Grand Wedding of Yu Zhou <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Yu, the second son of President Yuan, and Ms. Zhou Baozhu, the daughter of Zhou Xisan, held their wedding ceremony at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road. Guests included Cai Yuanpei, Ye Bogao, Wang Yiting, Wu Tiecheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yang Xiaotian, Xu Ruwei, Qin Liming, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Weicheng, and representatives from Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, and Yang Hucheng, as well as over 600 leaders from various circles in Nanjing and Shanghai. Mr. Tang Shaochuan officiated the wedding. After the ceremony, Mr. Tang gave a congratulatory speech, and the hosts, Mr. Yu and Mr. Zhou, gave thank you speeches. Mr. Yu also said, "My son's wedding is honored to have the respected Mr. Tang Shaochuan, who is admired throughout the country, as the officiant, and to have friends and relatives from all walks of life attend. This is a great honor. This wedding date of September 17th, although chosen by my son and daughter, happens to be the 10th anniversary of the Wuyuan Oath of the National Army. Ten years ago today, I was carrying a staff and traveling in the Mongolian desert. After traveling for dozens of days and tens of thousands of miles, I arrived at Wuyuan in hardship and difficulty, representing the Chinese Kuomintang, holding the national flag in my left hand and the party flag in my right hand, and awarding them to Mr. Feng Huanzhang, establishing the National Army in the Northwest, first relieving the siege of Shaanxi, and then joining forces in Zhengzhou. The north was pacified, and the unification of China by the Central National Revolutionary Army was achieved. Today, Mr. Feng Huanzhang is in Nanjing, holding a grand commemoration meeting, which further evokes my thoughts of today ten years ago. For the past ten years, I have only struggled for the party and done my best for the country with the spirit of hardship and difficulty. Therefore, what I hope for my son and daughter is not to inherit my property, and I have no property to give. I only hope that you can accept my decades of spirit of hardship and continue to struggle, so that you will not fail the hopes of our country for you young people, and you will be worthy of Mr. Tang and the good intentions of guests from all walks of life." Afterwards, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech on behalf of the guests. After the ceremony, the Yu and Zhou families hosted a banquet, and the toasting and conversation were very lively and grand for a time.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Macy's Report: The Aftermath of Chen's Death and Compensation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Chen's Wife Had a Formal Request; The Mutual Aid Society Did Not Intervene in the Compensation Amount</p>
<p>Regarding the case of rickshaw puller Chen Huizhang (rickshaw license no. 16863) who was beaten to death by a British sailor, and his wife's receipt of compensation from the British military authorities, there have been various and conflicting rumors circulating. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society specifically convened a board meeting on the 14th of this month to discuss this matter. Given the nature of the discussion, Chairman Macy specially nominated Mr. Han Yushan as temporary chairman. After this was approved, deliberations began immediately. Some argued that Chairman Macy's handling of the matter was a case of exceeding his authority. Therefore, it was decided at the board meeting on the 8th of this month to request Macy to report the details of the process. Macy then submitted the following report to the board: "In the past, when member rickshaw pullers encountered misfortunes in their daily work, the Mutual Aid Society would assist them in obtaining appropriate compensation for their losses. This is indeed a useful service that our society provides to its members. After the Chen Huizhang incident, Chen's wife immediately requested assistance from the society on July 13th. The insurance money of forty yuan was immediately paid to her. However, Chen Huizhang's death was due to a fight with a British sailor, a special circumstance. Therefore, the society's staff consulted the chairman on how to handle the issue of compensation in order to comply with the proper procedures. The chairman then advised that the matter should be closely monitored at all times, and that every effort should be made to obtain compensation from the relevant parties. In the days that followed, it was suddenly heard that an organization called the 'Support Association' had been formed, with the general aim of punishing the murderer, and with some quasi-political issues mixed in. Upon hearing this, the chairman immediately instructed the secretary-general to handle the matter cautiously. Unless Chen's wife came to the society to plead and sign a request, no action should be taken on her behalf. Subsequently, Chen's wife did come to the society to request assistance in pursuing compensation, and drafted a formal request, which is currently kept in the Shanghai Local Court. From the moment the Mutual Aid Society accepted Chen's wife's request, it instructed its staff to arrange for Chen's wife to meet with the British military representative. As a result, on July 22nd, the chairman led Chen's wife to the police station to meet Deputy Chief Inspector Yang (a British person), who was entrusted by the British military authorities to handle this matter. Mr. Xu, a staff member of the Mackenzie Road office, and another person, said to be Chen Huizhang's brother, accompanied Chen's wife. The chairman withdrew after a few minutes of introductions and did not participate in the negotiations. Afterwards, Chen's wife reported to the chairman's office that further negotiations would continue the next morning. After the second round of negotiations the next day, Chen's wife came to the society and stated that she had agreed to accept six hundred yuan as full compensation, and that she could collect the compensation that afternoon. That afternoon, Chen's wife returned to the chairman's office with the compensation of six hundred yuan. The chairman immediately advised her that such a large sum should be deposited in a bank for safekeeping, but as she did not know how to do so, she took one hundred yuan with her, and temporarily deposited five hundred yuan in the office of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. The next day, after this sum was returned to Chen's wife, she immediately took it to the Bank of China, deposited four hundred yuan, and kept one hundred yuan for her own expenses. The foregoing is the whole story of the Mutual Aid Society's involvement in the matter. At the time, Chen's wife was extremely satisfied with the resolution and very grateful for the assistance provided by the Mutual Aid Society. However, the Mutual Aid Society never considered the political aspects of the matter or the issue of punishing the murderer, as these matters were not within the scope of the society's responsibilities." During the discussion of the aforementioned report, Macy further stated that he had never said a word about the amount of compensation. He felt that his task was completed after he introduced Chen's wife to the British military representative, and that Chen's wife was accompanied by the deceased's brother, so there was no need for him to participate in the negotiations. Some said that Macy, as a foreigner, did not value the lives of Chinese people very much. Macy said that this statement was unreasonable and he did not want to argue against it, but he felt that Chen's wife's acceptance of the compensation was the most appropriate course of action, because otherwise, it would be necessary to resort to legal proceedings, and the outcome was highly uncertain. Furthermore, the Mutual Aid Society had previously mediated hundreds of disputes, large and small. If this matter were to be handled by the relief committee or the board, on the one hand, the procedure would be too cumbersome, and on the other hand, the matter was not within the scope of relief. Chen's wife's acceptance of the six hundred yuan compensation was entirely of her own volition, and she told those she spoke to that she was satisfied with the resolution. Regarding the suggestion that such matters should be handled by the relief committee, Macy said that last year alone, a total of two thousand three hundred and thirty-six cases, large and small, were mediated. If each and every one of them had to be handled by the relief committee or the board, it would be procedurally impossible. In the end, it was decided that the board should organize a special committee in the future, so that when the staff encountered difficult problems, they could report to the committee for instructions. It was also resolved to express confidence in Mr. Macy, but this resolution should only be regarded as Mr. Macy's personal action, and not as something for which the board should be responsible. At that time, someone also mentioned the problem of the decreasing number of rickshaws. Mr. Macy (who had returned to the position of chairman) immediately stated that this matter was not on the agenda and could not be discussed. He then announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>

<p>Last night at 9:30 PM, the Customs Water Police Station received a telephone call from Huang Yu Fu, the comprador of the Japanese Osaka Company's Nanyang-bound Shengjing Maru, reporting that a man and a woman were found in the steerage, appearing to be smuggling a young woman out of the country, and requesting that they be investigated and arrested. The police dispatched Detective Li Wenqi, along with investigator Chen Shaoting from the Women and Children Relief Association, to board the ship and bring the two individuals to the police station. According to the woman, her name is Jiang Qiaoyun, she is seventeen years old, a native of Changzhou, her father is Jiang Jintian, who is a farmer. When I was eight years old, I was adopted by my maternal uncle Zhou Dexin, a native of Wuxi, as his daughter, living at No. 1 Jiqing Lane, Dongxing Road, Wuxi. I am currently a worker in a yarn factory. A month ago, Yang Baozhu (24 years old) from Anhui opened a sesame cake shop in front of my house. He came to my house to play, and we became acquainted. He was very generous, so I stayed with him at the First Hotel for five nights, and had sexual intercourse with him more than ten times. Now I am willing to go to Fujian with him as his wife, etc. According to Yang Baozhu, he used to be the bugler of the Third Company of the Fifth Regiment of the Fujian Security Brigade. He was discharged two months ago and returned to Wuxi to open a shop. Because Qiaoyun voluntarily wanted to marry me, I accompanied her to Fujian to make a living, etc. The detective then found a short-term leave certificate issued by the regimental commander of the Fifth Regiment on Yang's person. He further questioned Yang, asking why he was opening a shop in Wuxi when he had not been discharged, obviously plotting to seduce Qiaoyun and sell her abroad. Yang lowered his head and said nothing upon hearing this. The detective further questioned Qiaoyun, asking if her parents knew that you were coming to Shanghai. Qiaoyun replied that her uncle and aunt did not know at all. The detective concluded that the case was clear. Yang Baozhu's seduction of a good family's daughter, first raping her and then selling her, was truly heinous. He ordered that they be sent to the local court for trial in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Lu Zijie et al. Lose Lawsuit for Base Land; Li Tixian et al.'s Appeal Rejected</p>
<p>The Lu clan ancestral hall in the Lan Ni Bo Plain in Pudong, Shanghai (i.e., the ancestral hall of the virtuous Lu Wenyu), has been diligently carrying out the work of rectifying the ancestral hall's public property since this spring, when its clansmen organized a public property rectification committee. Because Li Tixian and Lu Dao colluded with Cui to steal and sell land under the name of Lu Tushan, which was part of the public property, they sued Li Tixian et al. and won. Now, it has been discovered that more than three mu of land belonging to the Lu clan cemetery owned by the association was recently claimed by the Lu Zijie brothers, who styled themselves as direct descendants of Wenyu, hoping to make an unreasonable claim to the property. After the chairman of the association committee, Lu Zhiqing, and the lawyer he hired, Mr. Gao Junxiang, presented various pieces of evidence to prove in detail that the land had always belonged to the ancestral hall, the local court ruled the day before yesterday, confirming that the land belonged to the Lu clan ancestral hall. As for Li Xunxian et al.'s theft and sale of land under the name of Lu Tushan, after the first instance judgment ordered its return, Li Tixian et al. refused to accept it and appealed. It is said that the Suzhou High Court has also rejected their appeal.</p>

<p>The Chinese Ancient Coin Society held its seventh research meeting yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Hu Puan, Ding Fubao, Xu Peikun, Yang Kailing, Zhang Feng, and Wei Juxian. The research topic was "Chichi Wuzhu." Mr. Zhang Jiliang elaborated in great detail. The Chichi Wuzhu was cast during the Yuanding reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and was worth ten times its face value. At that time, the people paid taxes and could not use anything other than Chichi. The Book of Han wrote "赤側 (chì cè)" as "赤仄 (chì zè)", which is because the Shuowen said that 仄 (zè) originally meant 側 (cè). In addition, the second issue of the society's journal, Ancient Coins, has been published. It contains Weng Yiquan's unedited manuscript of Ancient Coin Compilations, which is particularly valuable. In addition, there are great works by Xu Yugong, Luo Bozhao, Ding Fubao, and Shu Juxian.

<h3 id="e119">Unified Transport and Sales of Anhui and Jiangxi Black Tea This Year Has Achieved Excellent Results; Improving International Reputation by Destroying Inferior Tea; Prices Increased and Settlement Was Expedited; Minister Wu Shi Deeply Commended This <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, in order to revive the export of black tea and assist tea farmers, specially established the Anhui and Jiangxi Black Tea Sales Transport Committee and set up a Black Tea General Transport and Sales Office in Shanghai to handle sales affairs. Now that the black tea season is about to pass, the Transport and Sales Office is about to close. For the sake of assistance, the Transport and Sales Committee specially dispatched three committee members to Shanghai yesterday. The reporter of the Shenshi News Agency investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Production; Tea Merchants Profited; The governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, in order to assist tea farmers and revive the export of black tea, implemented unified transport and sales this spring with the assistance of the Ministry of Industry. In May, the Black Tea Transport and Sales Committee was established, and the Black Tea General Transport and Sales Office was set up in Shanghai, appointing Cheng Zhenji and Hui Zhen as general manager and deputy manager, respectively, to be responsible for sales affairs. On the one hand, they negotiated sales methods with foreign firms, and on the other hand, they raised funds of 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan to lend to tea merchants at low interest. A total of more than 100 tea merchants in Anhui and Jiangxi produced more than 72,000 boxes of Qihong tea and more than 8,000 boxes of Ning tea this year. As of the 15th of this month, more than 72,000 boxes have been sold, accounting for 90% of the total value. The tea merchants have profited more than 1 million yuan in total. Only more than 8,100 boxes remain unsold, and it is decided that they will be sold out by the end of September.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai to Destroy Inferior Tea</p>
<p>Because the black tea season is about to end, the Anhui and Jiangxi Black Tea Transport and Sales Committee intends to end this year's black tea business early. It has specially dispatched three committee members, Chen Ding, Lu Zhaomei, and He Chongjie, to Shanghai to assist the Shanghai General Transport and Sales Office in handling the closure. Three methods have been decided upon: (1) Wholesale the remaining unsold black tea; (2) Set a deadline for settling outstanding accounts; (3) Streamline the organization. Regarding the sale of remaining tea, the Tea Quality Assessment Committee of the Transport and Sales Office has now graded the tea and is contacting various tea buying foreign firms to negotiate prices. Jardine Matheson, Concord, Jinlong, Zai Yu Tai, etc., are all interested in purchasing and are competing to increase prices. The deal is expected to be finalized within a day or two. However, among the remaining tea, there are inevitably a few inferior teas. More than 100 boxes that have been inspected and found to be substandard by the Quality Assessment Committee will not be allowed to be exported. It has been decided that they will be removed and burned to avoid affecting the reputation of black tea from the two provinces. The Social Affairs Bureau and Chinese and foreign tea merchant associations will be invited to the site to supervise at that time. Specific methods have also been set for settlement and streamlining, and it is expected that they will be completely completed by the end of October.</p>
<p>Minister Wu Commends the Transport and Sales Results</p>
<p>As for the effect of the Anhui and Jiangxi Black Tea Transport and Sales Office this year, it is: (1) The price has increased. The highest value this year is 50% higher than last year; (2) The settlement has been expedited. In previous years, the settlement period had to be until the end of the year, and sometimes even as late as January or February of the following year, while this year, the sale will be completed in September and the closure in October, which is three months earlier. Other tea farmers have also benefited a lot. The above points are sufficient to show the effectiveness of unified transport and sales. Externally, due to the improved quality and perfect packaging, the reputation of tea in foreign countries has been increased. It is also known that Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry recently came to Anhui to provide instructions on everything and deeply commended the achievements of the unified transport and sales of black tea. In order to discuss plans for next year, the Transport and Sales Committee will hold a meeting in Jiangxi in October to decide on methods.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Accused of Murder: Stage Manager of Xiang Theater Sentenced - Wang Shubao Sentenced to 13 Years Imprisonment - Zhang Xiaowanzi Convicted of Perjury <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shubao from Yancheng, the owner of the Xiang Theater, was involved in a case during the January 28th Shanghai Incident at Hongkou Xiangyan Bridge, where a dismissed detective, Ji Zhongtang, was shot and killed. Someone distributed leaflets accusing Wang of colluding with Wang Sanshizi (Wang Thirty Son) Zheng Xiaoheizi to orchestrate this tragedy due to a dispute over the actress Yu Yanfang. The District Court Prosecutor detained Wang and indicted him along with the original accuser, Zhang Xiaowanzi. After repeated trials and debates in the criminal court, Judge Yu held a hearing yesterday and announced the verdict: Wang Shubao was found guilty of joint murder and sentenced to 13 years of imprisonment. Zhang Xiaowanzi was found guilty of perjury and sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The reasons for the verdict were explained to Wang Shubao, stating that the witnesses testified that it was not him who committed the murder, and the victim's family also stated that it was not him. However, Zhang Xiaowanzi, three days after Ji Zhongtang's death, had identified him in the presence of Ji Chenshi. Now, Zhang Xiaowanzi says it was not him, therefore the suspicion of perjury against him is established, and the case is serious, so he cannot be acquitted. However, if he does not agree, he can appeal. The judge also told the defense lawyer that if he appeals, there is favorable evidence that when Zhang Xiaowanzi reported the death of Ji Zhongtang on his behalf, he said that the murderer Wang Shushi had pockmarks and a Northern accent, so in the appeal reasons, it is appropriate to seek strong counter-evidence in this regard. Since Wang Shubao is guilty, Zhang Xiaowanzi is naturally guilty. The lawyers requested bail, and the judge instructed them to submit a written request to the court for consideration with the prosecutor, and then ordered him to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Qingde Rubber Factory - Minor Disturbance Yesterday Morning <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Qingde Rubber Factory at Hengbang Bridge, Zhabei, was founded by Japanese merchant Usukawa Tei. The factory employs Chinese workers. Recently, after the dismissal of six workers, including Zheng Wenmao and Zheng Wenpu, the workers expressed their support and planned to strike. At around 7:00 AM yesterday, the workers gathered and guarded the factory gate, preventing entry and exit, causing a disturbance. The factory owner, Usukawa Tei, reported to the police station for protection. The police dispatched officers to arrest the leading workers, Wei Guangxi, Zhang Hongbi, Sun Yichun, Chen Jingfa, and others, and took them to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Hongxing Hosiery Factory - Continued Trial of Female Workers <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Hongxing Hosiery Factory at 221 Caishi Road in the French Concession experienced a conflict on the 9th of this month at around 10:00 AM due to a work stoppage by female workers. Fifteen female workers, including Wang Xiuying, were beaten and injured. The French police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to stop the incident, and the disturbance subsided. Subsequently, the Social Bureau sent personnel to mediate several times, but a satisfactory resolution has not yet been reached. The factory manager, Li Mingding, reported to the French police that the fifteen female workers who were beaten and injured were guilty of obstructing freedom, damaging property, and causing injuries. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Penghuan of the Special First Court presided over the trial in Criminal Court Eight. First, Gu Shouxi, the lawyer from the Police Department, stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement because the investigation was not yet complete. Then, the plaintiff, Li Mingding, described the situation of the conflict at the time, as well as the smashing of the accounting office and manager's office in the factory, and the injuries suffered by female workers Ni Qibao, Zhou Lanzhen, Li Asi, Li Awu, Sheng Yuezhen, and others. Except for Wang Xiuying, who was unable to attend due to serious injuries being treated in the hospital, the defendants, Yang Bao, Zhou Qinxian, Ge Yushu, Wu Wanzhen, Zhou Fengxian, Zhang Fengxian, Xu Guiyun, Zhang Qinxian, Jin Aling, Xing Zhaodi, Li Wumei, Zhang Yuru, Wu Wenyu, and Wang Chunmei, and other fourteen people, arrived with their defense lawyer Ma Lemin.

<h3 id="e125">Malaria Increasingly Rampant in the Public Concession Last Month - Dysentery Increased But Not Very Concerning - Cholera Can Be Said to Have Been Avoided This Year <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department report for August states that the most noteworthy point regarding the sanitation situation in the Concession during that month was the increasing prevalence of malaria. The number of malaria cases in July increased by 64 compared to June, totaling 96 cases, and in August, it increased again to as many as 157 cases, which is a worrying phenomenon. Moreover, its source is the same as the previous month, with a large number of cases occurring in the Eastern District, and it has been determined that as many as 45 cases came from a certain location. Currently, the mobile mosquito eradication team has been spraying mosquito repellent into stagnant water in the East and West districts, and the effect is quite good. The concern is that other mosquito breeding sites are not under the jurisdiction of the Concession, and there is a possibility of sporadic outbreaks at any time. Furthermore, although mosquito eradication is the key to preventing malaria, the prevention efforts of private residences should not be ignored. Setting up screens in the homes of wealthy families is an essential measure, and spraying with petroleum-based insecticide should also be carried out daily without interruption. Regarding the matter of screens, although the price of copper wire screens is slightly higher, they are durable and more cost-effective than other inferior products. In addition, the window frames should be made of dry wood to prevent them from bending and forming gaps after they are made, allowing mosquitoes to enter the room.</p>
<p>Dysentery also increased in August, but this is due to the season and is not a cause for great concern. Other gastrointestinal diseases are not significantly different from last year. Furthermore, this year's fly eradication work has been very effective, but the hot weather is also unfavorable for the reproduction of flies, and it is feared that flies will breed again after the weather cools down in the autumn, so it is hoped that citizens will pay more attention to assistance, and unclean objects should not be dumped everywhere, but should be placed in garbage cans and covered. Fly traps should also be prepared in large quantities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many cases of rabies were discovered in August, which is very concerning. The reason is that stray dogs from outside the Concession have entered the Concession. Regarding the issue of cholera, 38 patients were tested in August, but no true cholera bacteria were found. Now that the weather has cooled down, a major outbreak can be avoided this year.</p>

<p>Chen Caizhen, a 21-year-old woman from Suzhou who lived at 37 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, worked as a female teahouse attendant in the Civilization Theater on the upper floor of the New World Amusement Park on Tibet Road. Recently, a man from Suzhou, Wang Boquan, often went to the New World to play and asked Chen Caizhen to make tea, and they became acquainted. Later, Chen was tempted by Wang and had a physical relationship. On the 3rd of this month, Wang went to the New World again and invited Chen Caizhen to go to Wuxi for sightseeing. Although Chen agreed, she was afraid, so Chen turned to invite her little sister, Zhou Yindi, a 21-year-old woman from Hangzhou, to go with her. Wang, Chen, and Zhou arrived in Wuxi at around 7:00 AM on the 14th and stayed in room 20 of the Railway Hotel. After a short rest, Wang suddenly went out and selected a Keston pocket watch worth 38 yuan from the Hendali Watch Shop, asking them to send it to the Railway Hotel to collect the money. The shop assistant saw that Wang was beautifully dressed and did not suspect anything else, so he sent an apprentice with the watch to the Railway Hotel. Wang immediately introduced Chen Caizhen to the apprentice as his wife and Zhou Yindi as his wife's friend, but said that he had to go out to estimate the value of the watch. At that time, the apprentice saw that his wife and friends were there, so he handed over the watch. Unexpectedly, Wang never returned. The apprentices then realized that they had been deceived and urgently reported to the local Public Security Bureau, who dispatched police to arrest Chen and Zhou and bring them to the Public Security Bureau. After Chen and the others explained the situation and volunteered to compensate for the price of the watch, they paid four yuan at the time, and the rest of the money was to be paid in Wuxi two days later. Chen and the others were released and paid all the room and board expenses at the Railway Hotel before returning to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 PM the night before, Chen Caizhen saw Wang Boquan also arrive while working at the New World, so she called Chinese police officer number 2684 and arrested Wang. The original stolen pocket watch was found on his person and taken to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin from the Police Station described the case, saying that the Wuxi Public Security Bureau was not yet aware of the case, so he requested permission to detain Wang in order to notify the Wuxi Public Security Bureau to send someone to pick him up. Chen Caizhen and Zhou Yindi also confessed the above situation. Wang Boquan was questioned and gave evasive answers. Judge Chuan ordered Wang to be detained and rescheduled the hearing, pending notification to the Wuxi Public Security Bureau to send someone to court for verification.</p>

<p>The home of Wang Zhicheng at 6 Yongji Lane, North Suzhou Road, was suddenly invaded by six robbers at 7:50 PM the day before yesterday. The robbers searched and stole valuables, including five thin jade rings worn by Wang's wife and other valuables, worth about 126 yuan. One of the robbers, Zhang Wenfu from Jiangbei, was discovered by Chinese police officer No. 1629 and Chinese detective Shen Dehui while fleeing at the Zhejiang Road Bridge in North Sichuan, due to his panicked appearance. They immediately stopped him and found four jade rings and two bundles of copper coins, totaling one to two hundred coins, on his person. At the time, they did not know that he was a robber. Because they saw him running out of Chengji Lane, they took him to the lane and saw that Wang's house was wide open in the front and back, with no one inside. They were suspicious, so they entered and shouted loudly. Wang and the others came downstairs from upstairs. When they saw that they were detectives, they immediately reported that they had just been robbed and pointed out that Zhang Wenfu, who had been arrested, was the actual robber. They then took the man to the police station. According to Zhang's confession, he colluded with Zhang Xiaoerzi, Zhang Erxiao, Longjiao, Dakuaitou, and other five people to rob Wang's house. The gun he carried was not real. Wang Zhicheng identified that the robbers held guns with rusty iron handles, which were definitely real guns. Yesterday morning, the police sent the suspect Zhang to Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him in accordance with Article 330, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Because the accomplices are at large, he requested that the hearing be rescheduled. After Judge Fu Lin interrogated the suspect Zhang, he ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Inside the criminal holding room behind the First Tribunal of the Second Special District Court, at around 2:00 PM on the 15th, two thieves, Wu Asan and Wang Agen, escaped by prying open the iron fence on the back door. The escape was discovered and reported by inmates in the same cell. The heads of the High Court, Special Second Court, Yang Court and Wang Court, and the Western officer from the Police Department, went to inspect the scene. Because the two police officers, No. 515 Jiang Fengyuan and No. 141 Wang Yongchang, who were in charge of the keys to the front and back doors of the room, were suspected of negligence, they were transferred to the Prosecutor's Office. The day before yesterday at noon, the Chief Prosecutor opened a trial and questioned them. Because No. 515 had heavier responsibility, he was ordered to post bail. Wang had a lighter responsibility and was ordered to be dismissed and await review. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Wang and Clerk Zhao Yifen went to Criminal Court Two and ordered the three inmates who were detained in the same cell as the escapees, Xiao Along, Gu Wanrong, and Zhang Munsheng, to be interrogated. According to Xiao Along, he is 41 years old, from Yancheng, and lives in a bungalow in Yonghe Lane, Haining Road. He used to do a sock factory business, but recently became unemployed. He was arrested for stealing a wallet and was taken to the waiting room at around 10:00 AM on the 15th, along with nine other people. The police officer did not take the key to the back door, and after a while, five people were taken away before the key was taken away. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it was discovered that two people had gone down from the back door and did not return, so it was assumed that they had escaped, so the police officer was immediately notified. The two escapees took off their clothes outside the back door and left behind two hats, etc. Gu Wanrong confessed that he was 17 years old, from Ningbo, and lived in Tilanqiao making light bulbs. He was arrested for theft. He was taken to the waiting room at around 10:00 AM on the 15th. The other two (referring to the escapees) were looking out the window before they escaped. One person said, "There is a foreigner here, it's okay." Later, I fell asleep. It was Xiao who discovered that they had escaped and then knew that the two had actually escaped. Zhang Munniu's confession was the same as Gu's. Finally, police officers No. 515 and No. 141 were questioned. According to No. 515, although I was in charge of the key, it was hung on the window outside the front door of the waiting room, and any police officer could take the key to open the door. This has always been the case. No. 141 said that when No. 515 returned from lunch, I handed over the prisoners to him, and no one was missing. I don't know how they escaped. After verifying the confessions, the court ordered Xiao Gu and Zhang, the three inmates, to be returned to the police station for detention. The two police officers were ordered to be dismissed and await review. In the afternoon, after Prosecutor Wang investigated, he considered that police officer No. 515 Jiang Fengyuan was more responsible and issued an order not to allow bail, and ordered him to be detained in the detention center to await prosecution.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Zhou Bangjun, General Manager of Zhongxi Pharmacy, Donates the Qiu Feihai Memorial Cup <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The trophy is named "Mingxing Cup", entrusted to the Physical Education Association for safekeeping and planning. The donated funds have been remitted to the family members, and continued donations are encouraged.</p>
<p>Since the start of fundraising for the late tennis player Qiu Feihai Memorial Cup, there have been very few donors. A few days ago, the Xiahui Road Xinhua Savings Bank, which is obligated to collect donations, received a letter from Zhou Bangjun, General Manager of Zhongxi Pharmacy in this city, stating that he is willing to contribute 500 yuan from the surplus of the company's Mingxing Perfume Cup as the need for cup making, named "Mingxing Cup", engraved with the words commemorating Mr. Qiu, and all the donations received will be remitted to the Qiu family. It was immediately notified to the initiator, Mr. Hu Xiansheng.</p>
<p>Hu Xiansheng Talks</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu, the memorial cup competition has been contacted with the Sports Promotion Association and is planning everything. Generally, a committee will be formed by the Association to keep it in custody. Mr. Zhou's righteous act is very rare. In addition to preparing a letter of thanks, the donations received have been remitted to Mr. Qiu's family as instructed. However, Qiu's mother and wife are still in a foreign land, looking at the motherland from afar, and they are suffering from a lack of funds for living. Even if the Cup revenue were water from a cart, it would be difficult to reverse the course. I hope that all sectors will have pity and continue to contribute donations so that Mr. Qiu's mother and wife can avoid drifting in a foreign land. The original letter from Mr. Zhou is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou's Original Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read in the newspaper that your bank is collecting donations for Mr. Qiu Feihai's memorial cup. Although there are donors, the donations are not enthusiastic. A generation of national tennis players, their souls are difficult to comfort underground. Our company attaches great importance to sports and admires Mr. Qiu's life very much. Unfortunately, he died of illness in a foreign land, and we deeply mourn him. We are now willing to contribute 500 yuan from the surplus of the Mingxing Perfume produced by our company, and entrust the Standard Sports Equipment Company to design and manufacture a Mingxing Cup, specially engraved with words commemorating Mr. Qiu. As for the competition management method, it is proposed that the National Sports Promotion Association organize a committee to plan it. We hope that your bank will convey this intention to Mr. Hu Xiansheng, the initiator of the Qiu Jun Memorial Cup. As for the memorial cup donations that have been received at this time, it is not necessary to directly remit them to the Qiu family. I send this letter to the Qiu Feihai Memorial Cup Collection Office of Xinhua Bank, Zhou Bangjun, General Manager of Zhongxi Pharmacy, September 16.</p>

<p>Regular meeting</p>
<p>The Qinghua Football Club has been organized for nearly ten years and is the oldest Chinese football team in the Western League. This is due to the enthusiastic promotion of the founder, Mr. Hu Guoqiao, and the emergence of talented people. The current Western League is about to begin. The club is scheduled to hold a meeting at the City Stadium at 10:30 AM this Sunday to discuss all the progress. The lineup of the club is attached as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Jingen Zhang Rongbiao</p>
<p>Zhou Hongliang Chen Xiaoping Qiu Ruilong Ling Yunlong</p>
<p>Tang Jianting Wang Cuixing Yang Guozhen Yang Guisheng</p>

<p>After Donghua Football Club changed its main venue to the City Sports Stadium this term, and as the Western League football season is about to begin, in order to test their skills, they specially invited the strong Western team of Portugal to play the first friendly match at the City Sports Stadium at 3:30 PM tomorrow (Saturday the 19th). According to the skills of the two teams, they have long been well-known and do not need to be introduced. At the beginning of football, there is such a wonderful competition, which is a feast for the eyes of fans. Since the opening of the City Sports Stadium, except for the National Games and the World Games preliminaries, this competition is also the first important competition of the season. As for the Donghua lineup that will play tomorrow, it has been learned as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Ning Feng Yunyou</p>
<p>Gu Shangxiang Li Yichen Shu Shigeng</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Xu Wenkui Dai Linjing Zhang Jinhai Xue Wenxiu</p>
<p>Reserves Guan Xun'an Zhuang Youren Chen Gong</p>
<p>Since Donghua has announced the above lineup, it can be seen that the important task of goalkeeper has been determined to be borne by Zhang Rongcai. Since Sun Jia has not returned as a forward, it is natural to find someone to replace him. Now Xu Wenkui has been transferred from the right forward to the left forward, and Xue Wenxiu has been replaced on the right wing. It is also very powerful. However, Zhang Jinhai is still listed as the right forward. Zhang's affiliation with Jinde or return to the parent team seems to have become ambivalent. What exactly will happen will be known after today's Western League general meeting.</p>

<p>Jinde Sports Association is organized by employees of the Zhonghua Book Company. When the Western League annual competition is approaching, some of Donghua's players are still overseas. Jinde is emerging from the crowd, with the ambition to compete. Now, in order to rectify the lineup, they have specially invited the British Navy, who is good at fighting and has met each other in the West. They will meet at Shen Garden at 3:00 PM this Sunday afternoon. At that time, the two teams will meet, and it is really unknown who will win. The Yanping Road, which has been deserted for a long time, will be very lively again. The Jinde lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Hu Bingquan Qian Zonghan</p>
<p>Wu Zhenxiang Wang Qi Zhang Yinhai</p>
<p>Chen Boxian Qian Zhiming Xu Jincheng Yu Hexing Yu Yunsheng</p>
<p>Cao Chuxiong Jiang Laishun Nan Douwen Xu Buyun Gu Jingchu Zhang Jinhai Lu Xiquan</p>

In the meeting, in addition to re-electing three executive committee members, five appeal committee members, and six league committee members, the most important thing is to draw up the order of each group. The secretariat of the association has also notified each member team a few days ago to specify which group league to participate in on the screen before the meeting, so that it can be approved at today's meeting. The list of players for each team must also be submitted before the meeting. At the same time, if you need to participate in the Cup competition, you must also register at this time. As for whether the emerging strong team Jinde will be invited to participate in Group A, it will also be decided today and will be a matter of concern to fans.</p>

<p>The first basketball championship of the Shanghai Sports Federation of the Ministry of Communications was originally scheduled to start in mid-June. Later, due to the hot weather, it was feared that it would be harmful to health, so it was decided by the council to hold the tennis competition earlier, and the basketball competition would be held after the autumn was cool. Now the tennis competition has all ended, and the weather is gradually getting cooler, so the competition section of the association issued a notice yesterday, deciding to start the competition on the 4th of next month, and decided to convene a team leader meeting at 5:00 PM today to discuss the competition matters.

<p>The news that world professional tennis stars Teirden van Ness and Miss Shabod were coming to Shanghai was once rumored. Yesterday (the 17th), the reporter specially visited Mr. Pupu Kanafanlo, who was in charge of this matter. According to him, he had received a telegram from Mr. Tie the day before, saying that he would set off today and leave the eastern United States, first to Honolulu, with a slight delay, and arrive in Japan on the 6th of next month. The date of arrival in Shanghai is November 2nd or 5th, because there are two ships to Shanghai at this time, the former is a US postal ship, which arrives in Shanghai at about 10:00 AM and must leave the port at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. During this urgent period, if it unfortunately rains, it may be difficult to attend the performance. The latter is a French ship, which has a three-day stay, which is more abundant. As for the details, Mr. Tie mentioned in the telegram that a fast letter has been sent and is expected to be received before the 13th of this month. As for the issue of remuneration, Mr. Tie's first telegram stated that it was necessary to guarantee an income of 20,000 yuan, but yesterday's telegram stated that no matter how much, as long as it is divided, it has been easier to handle. As for the performance period, I am afraid that there will only be two performances at most, or one performance, it is also unknown. However, if Mr. Tie arrives in Shanghai on the 2nd, if it happens to rain that week, then our people's feast for the eyes may become a pie in the sky again. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang also intends to invite him to visit Wuhan with his younger brother Xueming, and ask him to visit Pingjin. Both places have sent telegrams to contact him. Mr. Tie also mentioned it in yesterday's telegram, but said that he was still considering it. Tianjin has decided not to go. As for why Mr. Tie has been unable to make a final decision, Mr. Ka speculated that it was because when Japan invited him to perform at the beginning, it was intended to compete with the country's amateur players, but this was not allowed by the International Tennis Association and was stopped, which caused the Japanese to lose interest slightly. The scheduled number of performances has been declared to be still under consideration. Recently, the Linshan Conference has been very prosperous again, and Tie and others have also stayed there, so they have not been able to decide for a long time. As for the number of performances in Shanghai, Mr. Ka said that he thought that he would have to wait until Tie and others arrived in Japan before making a definitive statement. If necessary, I may go to Japan. How can the details be informed after receiving a detailed letter?</p>

<h3 id="e165">The Current State of Overseas Chinese Education in Manila - Despite Financial Difficulties, Schools are Notably Developed, But Each Operates Independently - In Response to Environmental Needs, English and Chinese are Taught Concurrently Starting from the Third Grade of Primary School <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila by correspondent Yan Wenchou)</p>
<p>Manila is the capital of the Philippines, home to over 10,000 overseas Chinese (with over 100,000 throughout the Philippine archipelago). Many come with their families, including over 5,000 school-aged children. If all these children were to attend Philippine schools, our overseas Chinese would fulfill their tax obligations and naturally have the right to enjoy education. However, when these children grow up, they would inevitably lose their national identity. If schools were established independently, following the facilities of primary schools in the mainland, there would be issues related to the environment and living skills. Furthermore, it would be impossible to strictly adhere to all regulations issued by the ministry. Therefore, overseas Chinese education has become a major topic. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of Nanjing sent its member Li Pusheng and the Ministry of Education sent inspector Fang Zhengyun to inspect education in various regions of Southeast Asia. They first arrived in Manila. The following is a description of the general situation of overseas Chinese education in Manila, which is also what those concerned about overseas Chinese affairs hope for.</p>
<p>(1) The Nascent Stage of Schools</p>
<p>When the United States first governed the Philippines, the first consul, Chen Ziyan (whose father, Chen Qianshan, was a Kapitan during the Spanish colonial era and a Jinshi graduate of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, assigned as the first consul to the Philippines), established the first school using the original Kapitan's yamen (government office). This is now the Zhongxi School, the oldest (with the most students in day and night classes, totaling 1,200) school in Southeast Asia. Soon after, the Kapitan's yamen was taken over by the American government and attached to the Chinese Charitable Association. At that time, China had not yet promulgated primary school regulations and viewed it as a charitable undertaking. Funding was provided by the Charitable Association. Although English was also taught, the number of students was only thirty or forty. Nevertheless, it represented a rudimentary form of a school in its initial stage. It was not until the spring of the Xinhai Revolution that it became independent from the Charitable Association. After the founding of the Republic of China, it was observed that education in the Philippines was advancing rapidly under American rule, and the people's intelligence was increasing daily. Simultaneously, more overseas Chinese were arriving with their families, and the number of school-aged children was increasing annually. As a result, in 1914, the Overseas Chinese Education Association was established here, levying a business surcharge (methods detailed below) as regular funding. Overseas Chinese schools in Manila gradually increased, and schools were also established in various cities and prefectures, each securing funding locally. Furthermore, most built their own school buildings. Unfortunately, overseas Chinese in various locations, perhaps due to deeply held partisan opinions, could not create a holistic plan for the development of public education. Otherwise, they would not merely be maintaining the status quo.</p>
<p>(2) The Past and Present of the Overseas Chinese Education Association</p>
<p>The association was established in 1914, initially with the prefix "Philippine," but its scope only extended to Manila. Its purpose was to expand overseas Chinese education (at that time, Manila only had the Zhongxi School). Therefore, it proposed levying a business surcharge to fund regular educational expenses. Chinese merchants gladly agreed. Under the local government's tax regulations, merchants had to pay a business tax of one dollar and fifty cents to the government for every one hundred dollars in sales. Simultaneously, an additional four and a half cents were levied as a regular fee for overseas Chinese education. This was collected quarterly every three months by the Likin Bureau (tax collection agency). This was something that any store could afford. During its peak, it generated over 100,000 dollars annually. The schools managed by the Education Association included one middle school, one girls' school, and six ordinary primary schools, with over 2,000 students in day and night classes. However, the business surcharge was voluntary and lacked a legal basis. Recently, the finances of overseas Chinese schools in Manila have become increasingly strained, forcing them to consider merging schools (leaving only one middle school, one girls' school, and primary schools). The business surcharge has been decreasing year by year. The reasons for this decrease are nothing more than (1) acting impulsively, (2) poor business conditions, and (3) emulation of others, resulting in annual revenue of no more than five or six thousand dollars this year. The Education Association bears the expenses of these schools and can only raise temporary funds to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>(3) The Relationship between the Education Association and the Schools Under Its Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese schools in British and Dutch territories often experience internal conflicts, with school boards controlling the power to hire personnel. Teachers often have their own backers, and principals lack the authority to manage the entire school. As a result, turmoil often erupts. In the case of the Manila Education Association, it only hires the principal. All other staff members and teachers within the school are recommended by the principal, and the board does not interfere with internal administration. Therefore, the educational sector is stable, with over half of the staff having served for more than a year. Some principals have served for over twenty years. This is not because the board of directors is abandoning its responsibilities but because it trusts the principal. However, this has led to a backlash from public opinion, which accuses the Education Association of being controlled by powerful figures and having lost its authority, merely being responsible for raising funds for the four schools under its jurisdiction. As a reporter on the side of the school, I dare not make a strong judgment on right and wrong.</p>
<p>(4) The Special Development of Overseas Chinese Schools in Manila</p>
<p>Despite the Education Association's financial difficulties, overseas Chinese primary schools have sprung up like bamboo shoots after the rain, showing remarkable development. Currently, in terms of school units, there are a total of 23 schools, some with dozens of students, others with one or two hundred, and the largest with nearly three hundred (excluding the four schools under the Education Association). The reason is that many of the former staff members of these schools have emotional ties and cannot be easily replaced, leaving no vacancies for newcomers. Moreover, many graduates of Minnan University's high school take Southeast Asia as their destination. However, their skills are not suited to the business environment, so they flock to the field of education. With too many monks and not enough gruel, they inevitably have to start their own ventures to support themselves. It is speculated that this is not far from the truth.</p>
<p>(5) The Distribution of English and Chinese Courses in Overseas Chinese Schools</p>
<p>According to the primary school curriculum standards required by the Ministry of Education, there is no foreign language subject. However, overseas Chinese schools are permitted to teach foreign languages starting from the fifth grade of primary school to adapt to the local living environment. Zhongxi, Zhongzhong, Puzhi, and No. 2 Primary Schools in Manila have the most students and the longest history among overseas Chinese schools. In the past, they devoted the mornings to Chinese language instruction and the afternoons to English language instruction, which has drawn much criticism from educators in the motherland. However, to explain the reasons for teaching Chinese and English separately in the morning and afternoon, it is necessary to start with the environmental factors. Since being enlightened by the United States, Filipinos have mastered English. Most overseas Chinese merchants deal directly with foreigners, and sales documents, transportation bills, and various labels are all in English. Recently, bookkeeping laws have been implemented, so clerks in the business world need to have a basic understanding of both English and Chinese. Overseas Chinese schools have been teaching both English and Chinese concurrently since the third grade of primary school, aiming for students to reach the seventh-grade English level by the time they graduate from junior high school. With a little training, they can handle all bookkeeping, typing, and import/export documents used in stores. This is unlike graduates from mainland junior high schools, who have to start from scratch when they enter the business world here. Therefore, many who are unaccustomed to business life flock to the field of education. Twenty years ago, English was an optional subject in overseas Chinese schools. Following the regulations of the ministry, a few hours were added each week starting from the fifth grade. However, most merchants felt that the skills were not useful and sent their children to Philippine schools. Weighing the pros and cons, even if overseas Chinese schools do not focus entirely on Chinese language, is it not better than sending them to Philippine schools to study foreign languages entirely?</p>
<p>The above is a discussion of the state of overseas Chinese education in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. As for the results of its management, the two inspectors, Li and Fang, will undoubtedly provide a detailed report after returning to China.</p>

<p>The status of provincial vocational schools and students studying abroad in higher education in Jiangxi Province in 1934 is detailed below. (1) Vocational schools include the Medical Vocational School, the Industrial Vocational School (also offering higher vocational courses equivalent to secondary school), and the Agricultural Vocational School (also offering higher and junior agricultural and forestry courses equivalent to secondary school). The Medical Vocational School has three grades, with 52 male students and 7 female students, 38 faculty and staff members, and an annual expenditure of 41,803 yuan. The Industrial Vocational School has four grades (plus eight grades in higher vocational courses), with 39 male and female students (plus 218 in higher vocational courses), 63 faculty and staff members, and an annual expenditure of 80,157 yuan. The Agricultural Vocational School has one grade (plus higher and junior agricultural and forestry courses in two grades), with 6 students (plus 69 in agricultural and forestry courses), 22 faculty and staff members, and an annual expenditure of 1,100 yuan. In total, these three schools have eight grades (plus 11 grades in the attached secondary school programs), with 104 students (plus 87 in secondary school programs), 123 faculty and staff members, and an annual expenditure of 126,160 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Students studying engineering abroad include 18 in Japan, 1 in Germany, 1 each in France and Belgium, and 5 in the United States, totaling 28. Students studying liberal arts include 13 in Japan, 3 in France, and 1 each in the United States and England, totaling 18.

Students studying commerce include 2 each in Japan, Germany, and the United States, totaling 6. Students studying medicine include 11 in Japan, 3 in Germany, and 1 in France, totaling 15. Students studying education include 6 in Japan, 2 in England, and 1 each in France and the United States, totaling 10. There are also 2 students studying agriculture in Belgium, 2 studying art in Japan, 1 studying physical education in Germany, and 6 studying other subjects, including 3 in Japan and 1 each in France, the United States, and England. In total, there are 72 students in Japan, 13 in Germany, 12 in France, 11 in the United States, 3 in Belgium, and 1 in Switzerland. In 1934, there were a total of 117 students studying abroad, with 63 supported by public funds, 8 partially supported by public funds, 5 receiving subsidies, 2 receiving Boxer Indemnity grants, and 39 self-funded. According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, there were only 621 students studying abroad from all provinces and cities in China in 1933. Jiangxi Province alone had 117 students studying abroad in 1934, so Jiangxi has a relatively large number of students studying abroad compared to other provinces and cities in the country.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Tea is Being Planned for Promotion <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea General Sales Office, with only about seven or eight thousand boxes of unsold tea in stock, is aiming to clear out its remaining inventory to quickly conclude its operations and is striving for a comprehensive sales push. In recent days, Mr. Cheng Zhenji, the manager of the office, has repeatedly convened meetings to discuss countermeasures and negotiate prices with foreign firms such as British-owned Jardine Matheson, Ewo, and Gibb Livingston, as well as the Yutai Tea Shop, for small-scale transactions, which are currently at a standstill. As for the green tea market, there have also been no major transactions, with only needle-shaped, eyebrow-shaped, and high-grade "Chouxin Zhenmei" teas experiencing slight sales, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Trade Association, the green tea market appears rather dull, and a quick turnaround is unlikely. Yesterday, foreign firms, due to receiving telegrams from overseas with tighter price quotes for "Chouzhen" and "Zhenmei" teas, did not conclude any deals at the discussed prices. However, the "Gongxi Baitu" business was relatively active, with prices similar to before, as well as sales of 11-yuan "Zhucha" teas on Tongfu Road.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Gold Standard Market Oscillates Before Falling Slightly <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market initially stabilized before weakening. Major players' supply and demand differed, leading to a rather confusing market situation with much oscillation in the middle. Surface activity loosened, and the market eventually retreated by a small fraction. In the morning, overseas silver markets showed London rising and the US remaining flat. Mond Nickel forward silver prices remained unchanged across the board. Exchange rates initially narrowed before rising. London bullion rose two and a half pence. Bank postings revealed both British and American currencies unchanged. Customs gold unit rose by two li. The standard gold price was posted at 1118.5 yuan. At the market's opening, many sellers immediately started selling, pushing the market downwards. Despite much oscillation in the middle, confidence remained weak, and bearish sentiment prevailed. Spot houses slightly supplied silver bars. HSBC's postings revealed both British and American currencies unchanged, continuing the downward trend. Silver equalization tax was announced to increase by half a point before stabilizing slightly. Then, major buyers started to become active, gradually stabilizing the market. At noon, the trend recovered upward, with the afternoon market striving for supply-demand balance and much struggle. The market was extremely mediocre. More sellers emerged in the afternoon. Indian silver was initially quoted down three annas, but the second quote remained unchanged. As a result, the trend slightly weakened. The October/November futures were posted by the bullish side at 2.89 yuan. Today's market situation is recorded below. Opening price was 1124.8 yuan, up eight jiao from the previous close. Ding Kangfu and Yong sold, retreating to four yuan. Xianghe Yuanmao Yongyi and others bought bars, rising to 4.4 yuan. Tongtaichang and Chunyuan Yong sold bars, falling to 3.7 yuan. Tongfu and others once reached 4.2 yuan. Jingfu San Duo Shengyuan Yong and others sold off. Although HSBC postings showed British and American currencies unchanged, it retreated to 3.3 yuan. Silver equalization tax was announced to increase by half a point before stabilizing slightly. Yuanchang Yongda Decheng Yiyu Daheng Jiuda and others rushed to buy. The noon closing price rose to 1124.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1123.9 yuan. Yuanmao Yong sold down to 3.8 yuan. Tongfu accepted bars, rising to four yuan. Yuanmao Yong Xianghe Zhengchang jointly sold off. Although Yingfeng Heng accepted bars, the closing price still fell to 1123.6 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price for Central Bank gold standard was raised to 1118.5 yuan. In terms of closing prices, it rose by approximately five yuan plus. This month's registered price is 1118 yuan, October's is 1121 yuan, and November's is 1124 yuan. Morning makeup water is 1118 yuan, fine gold is increased by six yuan to 1130.8 yuan. Spot market conditions are stable. The buying price for fine gold is increased by nine yuan, and the selling price is thirteen yuan. It is heard that Shengyuan Yong once bought 350 taels. Tianjin goods are increased by 10.05 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bullish side negotiated with Feng Yongyu Xinxiang Dachangxiang to give Dah Heng Qianchangxiang 2.8 yuan for the swaps. Later, Daheng countered by posting, rising to 2.9 yuan. Jingfu Ding Kangfu Shun posted to buy in. Transactions were scarce.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market. In summary, Daheng Yiyu Dacheng Qiaofeng Yong Tongfu Yingfeng Zhihui Xiang Demao Yong Yongde and others were on the buying side. Chunyuan Yong Qianchangxiang Shengyuan Yong Hengyu Qingfa Yong Fuxing Yong Tongfeng Heng Zhengjin Yuanmao Yong Fu'an Ding Kang Jingfu and others were on the selling side. The market situation for the day was stable and confusing. The market opened in the morning at 1124.8 yuan and closed in the afternoon at 1123.6 yuan. The highest price was 1124.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 1123.3 yuan, a fluctuation of 1.5 yuan. As a result, there was a setback of four jiao. This month, there are 595 remaining bars, with eight bullish parties and five bearish parties. In November, there are 1253 remaining bars, with twelve bullish parties and eleven bearish parties. November futures have 7000 castings, with 26 bulls and 41 bears. The total number of transactions was 1001 bars in the morning and 301 bars in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Fair; Swaps Open, Forwards Slightly Tight <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday saw swaps opening up, resulting in flat-near, tight-far rates. According to morning overseas reports, London forwards were up .0625 for near terms, and flat for far terms. New York silver market was unchanged. Mond Nickel's forward silver prices remained unchanged across the board. London bullion rose two and a half pence. British currency versus US currency narrowed by .25. British currency versus French currency fell by one pound sterling. US currency versus British currency rose by .1875. US currency versus French currency narrowed by .0625. Central Bank postings were revealed; British and American currencies were flat. Customs gold units rose by two li. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 and 25/100 pence and 3125/10000 pence respectively, and US exchange at 20.125 yuan, which were the same as the previous close, indicating that British and American currencies were flat. After the opening, banks slightly tightened, while foreign banks bought in East Asian currency. HSBC's postings revealed both British and American currencies were flat, and the market oscillated. Later, banks still had a selling appetite. Silver equalization tax was announced to increase by half a point, and confidence remained stable. Banks did swaps, and the trend wavered. The afternoon market also appeared confusing. In the afternoon market, banks did forward trades on shillings but remained flat. Japanese banks continued to buy, and East Asian currency transactions were relatively rare. Indian silver was initially quoted down three annas, but the second quote remained unchanged, but had a definite influence.

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>After old Mrs. Wang got up, she felt as if she had lost something from her whole body. What was it, she couldn't say, but the fact was that there was something missing from her. She tried her best to search, tried her best to ponder, planning to discover the reason, but no, the person was still her body, and her internal organs wouldn't lose one after sleeping for one night. She wore as many clothes as usual, so what else was worth hesitating about? Maybe she was confused herself. When people get old, all kinds of ridiculous things will play tricks on that old body, so it is inevitable that such strange feelings will arise out of nothing.</p>
<p>The brilliance of the hot morning sun of midsummer in July had already poured into the window, and the house was magnificent. Through the light waves, countless dust particles flew, just like the whirlwind rolling up in the blue sky. The difference was that these dust particles were always dancing there, with the arrogance of relatives as if rooted down. When the fresh air drifted into the house, the moldy dampness inside was buried, and old Mrs. Wang did not cough dryly because of the poor air. She had already experienced this point, which was the main reason why she particularly preferred the summer morning to the winter morning. She often said to the neighbors in the same yard: "Once summer comes, I will be resurrected. In winter, I am sick and uncomfortable. The air is good in summer."</p>
<p>At this time, the two neighbors in the yard had also gotten up, and the children were digging in the center of the yard, some were defecating, and some were staring greedily at the jujube tree. The women were lighting coal briquette stoves, and coal smoke floated into the sky like fog, and the fresh air was suddenly dyed turbid. Old Mrs. Wang started cleaning the house as usual, then picked up a piece of worn rag and wiped the dust off the window cover. When she picked up the mirror that had accompanied her for more than forty years to wipe the dust off the mirror surface, she suddenly cried out. It was a cry of surprise, and it showed that things happened suddenly. At that time, the mirror she had personally selected, a dowry item with many years of history, slipped gently out of her hand and fell to the ground, followed by a clear and crisp shattering sound, and the mirror shattered. She was stunned for a while, staring straight with her old eyes, raising her thin hands and staring blankly, not knowing what she was thinking. When she suddenly turned to go to her son's room in the west room, she shouted out a jumble of words: "Ah, the bracelet... Oh God, my bracelet... Did that evil thing steal it?... The Heavenly Lord will not agree... I want the bracelet..."</p>
<p>The west room was empty, and there was no sign of her son. Where did her son go? He used to sleep until the sun was high, why did he get up earlier than her today and go straight away? She originally wanted to ask her son if he had seen her bracelet. In this way, she completely understood the truth of the matter; she was angry, she was heartbroken, she jumped and beat her chest for a while, and even slapped the empty quilt where her son slept several times, as if this would relieve her hatred, and then she cried. There was no doubt that her son pulled it off her arm while she was sleeping last night, and he had long since sold it for a long time and squatted in the white flour house to live a debauched life. Old Mrs. Wang attached great importance to this bracelet. Although it was not necessarily worth much money, it was also a dowry item, and she wanted to bring it with her when she was buried in the soil in the future. With such a thought in mind, she regarded the bracelet as her second life. Just because her son was addicted to bad habits, she didn't know how many things he had stolen from her and exchanged for money to smoke white flour; her old partner died early, and seeing her adult son giving her all kinds of disappointments, she had long since canceled her hope for him in the future, not wanting to rely on his support, and prepared to end her life by herself. When a son grows up, he is no longer his own son. Mother says many good words in vain, and persuasion, agitation, and scolding are all useless. After she was discouraged, she occupied another camp and treated her son as an enemy, always guarding against him and not letting him get close. Since she had no power to exercise active control, she had to come up with this method of resistance from a passive perspective. In this way, her son still often seized an unexpected opportunity to steal her things that she thought were strictly guarded. Her son is really not a good son, her son makes his mother too sad, her son is obsessed with evil things...</p>
<p>As soon as the neighbors heard old Mrs. Wang's crying, many residents guessed what had happened again. Mrs. Zhang, Mrs. Li, and several children all ran over to explore the situation. After they found out, they tried to persuade her and asked the old lady to calm down. They also said by example: "Isn't it your son who stole our things too?" But today's old Mrs. Wang refused to be persuaded and continued to cry, still patting her chest and jumping, while shouting: "This is the only piece of jewelry left, you evil creature, you stole your mother's heart, the Heavenly Lord cannot forgive you, may the Heavenly Lord strike him dead with lightning." At this time, as if she had thought of a way, she ran out of the gate with a snotty nose and tears, only to hear her repeatedly saying: "I'm going to find that evil creature, I'm going to settle the score with him, I'm going to settle the score with him, talk some sense, find a place to reason."</p>
<p>When old Mrs. Wang ran to the entrance of the white flour house, Mrs. Zhang and Mrs. Li followed behind. They were purely worried about the old lady's unexpected behavior, fearing that some other unfortunate things would be caused by this rush - old people, death is like a shadow following them, and when there is a suitable opportunity, they will seize the life of the old. Taking this into account, they were willing to put down their own family affairs and come to fulfill their obligations to take care of this old neighbor. Old Mrs. Wang stopped at the entrance. The door was open, the window was open, and her son was sitting in the house smoking white flour, and he didn't move when he saw her, only talking idly with the XX people. She rushed in and shouted, "Xiao Quan, give me back my bracelet, you undying evil ghost, come out quickly!..." Before she could finish shouting, the XX people slapped her thin left cheek. She only felt a burst of dizziness in front of her eyes and ran out of the door. But she immediately recovered her spirits. She wanted to find her son to reason, and she also wanted to question the XX people, so she ran to the sub-bureau like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>"Old... Chief," she said stammeringly and out of breath, "My... son... smokes white flour... I went to the white... flour house... The XX people hit me... All are... not... unreasonable... Chief... You... for... for... for me... vent this anger..." She couldn't go on, she was like a ball of cotton, and suddenly collapsed onto the bench.</p>
<p>When the chief explained that their powers could not be exercised in the white flour house and could not go to the XX people's house to handle the case, old Mrs. Wang was so angry! What kind of talk was this! How could chiefs say such things! If the chiefs don't care about these things, then who should care?…</p>
<p>The time had reached nine o'clock. Just as old Mrs. Wang was about to refute the chief's unreasonable words that day, she was suddenly stopped by the sound of drums outside the door, and at this time, she saw that in the parade advertising team of XX eye medicine, there was her son inside. She was so happy that it was like opening a bright door, and she shouted, "Chief, this time it's good, my son is in that crowd. The one in green clothes, wearing a three-pointed hat on his head, holding a sign, catch him this time."</p>
<p>"This time it won't work either. Although it's on the street, because there are XX people in charge, that team is full of white flour addicts, so we can't do anything. If you go to grab him, it will cause negotiations, and this can't be done at all"! The chief persuaded, "Old lady, he is always your own son. Go home tomorrow and persuade him well."</p>
<p>"Isn't this without law? Alas! My God..." She stretched out her hand and patted her left cheek, watched the colorful advertising team in the past, and cried again.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Leaving Tokyo <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Amidst the bustling footsteps and waving white handkerchiefs, I left Tokyo, where half the sky was dyed blood red at night.</p>
<p>I met my friend Kuroda-kun in the train. He is a student in the Department of Chinese Literature, specializing in modern Chinese literature; when you meet a foreign friend in a lonely train, you can always have a sense of nostalgia, let alone drinking beer in the train dining car late at night, talking about his beloved poems and his double life.</p>
<p>In foreign life, what you can feel most is your own pitifulness and loneliness, just like a swallow that has just left the nest. On the one hand, it is attached to the old beams of the nest, but on the other hand, it is disgusted with this ordinary life and has great ambitions for everything else.</p>
<p>But at the same time, we can also see and feel the pitiful and small life of this strong neighbor—a dual life; I can especially feel it deeply from the mind and body of Kuroda-kun, this intellectual.</p>
<p>Kuroda-kun deeply hates war and often dreams of a peaceful life. Perhaps because he has suffered too much harm from the education of talent, he has not yet fully understood the war. However, in such times and circumstances, being able to hate war is already something that makes me feel satisfied and happy.</p>
<p>However, the so-called national life often obliterates people's individuality and freedom. Kuroda-kun abandoned this summer research life and went to his hometown of Shikoku, which is full of pine trees. This was sacrificed to the conscription order in times of emergency.</p>
<p>When it comes to imitating war, but you must imitate and prepare not from specializing in war, that kind of contradiction that obliterates one's life is often the foundation of tragedy.</p>
<p>Kuroda-kun is performing this scene of the tragedy on this stage. In the eyes of others, this may be an interesting and varied comedy, but in my eyes, who knows the taste of the dual life: Kuroda-kun's heart is probably covered with clouds of summer-like sorrow!</p>
<p>"The deadline is short, but the life that seems like a child's play is something I hate the most!" Kuroda-kun took a sip of beer and sighed.</p>
<p>"Alas! Is this the gift of the control system? We are hoping for the Athenian style of free system that gives us individual freedom when this kind of Spartan life is revived."</p>
<p>The night outside the window covered all the scenery of the fields and hills, only the sound of the wheels broke the silence of the universe.</p>
<p>The next day, at Osaka Station, when I turned my head and saw his posture standing blankly on the platform, it was as if infinite shadows and sorrows were piled up on his healthy shoulders.</p>

<p>In the six or seven-foot-tall cornfield,</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Also Considered a Commemoration</p>
<p>It would be best to spend three years "facing the wall" or ten years in "seclusion." Perhaps then the blood could cool, and the senses could become numb. Even if one cannot become a detached high monk, one could at least become a disciple of a saint who endures insults. Holding up the pen, one could "dutifully acknowledge" everything. Putting down the pen, one could obediently be a good citizen. If society strips away all its material conditions, then what remains is merely man-made right and wrong, and a so-called good citizen is one who lives in that society without any sense of right or wrong. Saying "yes" and echoing "yes," saying "no" and echoing "no." If one says "yes" but thinks "no," then one's "seclusion" is not deep enough, and one's "sitting in meditation" is insufficient. One may still not be qualified to be a remnant of a prosperous age. How must one be? There is no specific standard. If one could follow the Way of Lao-tzu and Zhuang-tzu, and go even further by forgetting right and wrong, taking others' right and wrong as one's own, while one's own right and wrong are not involved, perhaps then one could succeed. However, you must lie in bed at midnight and think it over thoroughly. Can you do it? Can you, or can't you? There is no bargaining in between. If you want to bargain, that is "business." However, for people like us who are still not free from the smell of rice, and who consider ourselves to be someone of importance, it is not "business" to those who hold the "sacred right." The explanation that this is not "business" is that you are both "entertaining prostitutes and accommodating scholars," but you want to consider yourself superior to prostitutes and actors. Or perhaps the world no longer needs a "tongue," but you still want to go back and ask your wife, open your mouth, and solemnly ask her to see if your tongue still exists. Or see if your hand has been broken like Kong Yiji's, or whether the rope around your neck can continue writing. Mentioning that old pen, you are as happy as a beggar mentioning his staff, a blaze of joy. But when you write, you must consider "neighborly policies," and you must consider "one year two months," etc. Would you like to be like that son of the sea god in Greek mythology, "Proteus"? He possesses foresight and the power to change his appearance. If you have such power, you can move your tongue according to objective situations, and you can also change your appearance according to objective situations. Then it will work. Can it be done? If not, then refrain from speaking, or "talk about humor," or "tell ghost stories," or "drink bitter tea," or "take a sea bath," or "say the weather is nice today," or "play dead." However, today happens to be such a day, which is a difficult "knot" to untie. Then I thought of what the old Taoist Zhang Yaoxing in the legend of "The Peach Blossom Fan" said to the infatuated couple Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun during the memorial service for the Chongzhen Emperor: "Where is the country? Where is the home?" Now, like those Christians who say, "Blessed by God," we still have a home and a country, but thirty million people have no home and no country. Talk about humor? "Drink bitter tea?" "Go up a volcano?" "Take a sea bath?" "Say the weather is nice today?" "Play dead?" None of them seem appropriate. Then may I ask, what should we do? Let's hold off on answering these for a moment. Mentioning "The Peach Blossom Fan" reminded me of the storyteller Liu Jingting. So, when the review committee's day comes… let me act as a storyteller and you as the audience. I will gather old stories, and you can criticize them. But I don't have Liu Jingting's talent. Naturally, I can't tell stories as vividly as Ma Zai. At the same time, my gathering of old stories is not for the sake of lamenting, but to find some material for discussion from the old stories themselves, to address reality. However, cutting history from the side will make it a series of dead facts, and the interpretation of these facts can vary depending on one's position. But the evolution of history itself will negate all arbitrary interpretations. I am now discussing the great issue of historical truth, but I can't discuss such lofty principles, and you won't listen. I'd better act as a storyteller and fulfill the duties of a storyteller.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I remember that an old opera house in Shanghai performed "Hate of the Late Ming Dynasty." I have no affinity for Peking Opera, and I didn't have the courage to watch the scene where the big gongs and drums shook "heaven and earth." However, a few months ago, I went to "Coal Hill," the historical site where "Hate of the Late Ming Dynasty" was played out, twice. The protagonist in that scene, the Chongzhen Emperor, has long been buried in a corner of the Thirteen Tombs. The five pavilions arranged in a line on Coal Hill have also been freshly painted because the Beijing Municipal Government is renovating the city. The magnificent colors of the painted rafters and embroidered beams may be just like the gorgeous scenery on the Shanghai stage. When you enter such a realm and see such a scene, and if you are not guided by an old Beiping person, or have not received more than six years of education, and don't even know this period of history, or even don't have the good fortune of a Shanghainese to have the opportunity to see this "remnant of hatred" being performed, or even if you are on the scene but have not read books like the Beijing Guide, you will never believe that this place was the place of death for the emperor of that generation who was destined for tragedy. However, I had a preconceived notion in my mind. When I entered the gate to Coal Hill, I thought of that historical fragment, and there was already a tragic scene in my heart. So, when I walked up the stone steps leading to the mountain and saw the white pine forest on both sides of the road, the gray-white color of their trunks and branches felt terribly desolate, as if they were forever commemorating the remnant of this fallen country. The "Guilty Locust" below, on whose side branches Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself, its old trunk, hollow and split into two, unable to bear the weight of its sin, and the withered leaves dyed gray, and the solemn-faced black fence surrounding it, and the stele outside the wall with white stones and vermilion characters "Site where Emperor Ming Si Zong died for his country," were all enough to draw my attention from the real scene to the theatrical scene of historical tragedy. Emperor Ming Si Zong is still active in people's minds today, probably because he is a character in a tragedy. However, I am not now, like those "examiners" of the former Qing Dynasty, squeezing into the doghouse-like "examination hall" to be forced to write a treatise on Emperor Ming Si Zong. I don't need to comment on whether this last emperor was good or bad. I think his tragic death, as far as he himself is concerned, made him seem like a Han Chinese. That is enough. This point is already higher than the political failures of Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong of the Song Dynasty, and political failures are nothing. If he had been born in modern times, he might have been able to take a plane and escape from Beiping, without suffering such a tragic fate. Perhaps, as Mr. Huang Zongxi, a remnant of the late Ming Dynasty, hoped in his "Mingyi Daifanglu," he could have been like Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty during the An Lushan Rebellion, who fled to Sichuan, or Emperor Daizong during the Tubo Rebellion, who fled to Shaanxi, or Emperor Dezong during the Zhu Ci Rebellion, who fled to Fengtian, and eventually achieved the goal of restoration. Therefore, he believed that the fall of the Ming Dynasty was due to the miscalculation of establishing the capital in Beiping. Speaking of this issue, it just so happens to contradict the opinion of some modern people who believe that if the capital of the National Government were not in Nanjing, but still in Beiping, the situation in North China might not have been so. Speaking of this, I want to be like that shape-shifting "Proteus" again, to impersonate a political commentator and comment on the rights and wrongs. Of course, my views are not worth laughing at by those brilliant political commentators. But at least it represents a bit of my opinion. Fine, it is reasonable and proper to move the capital to avoid the enemy's sharp edge and seek restoration gradually. Taking other countries as examples, New Turkey did not make Constantinople its capital but moved its capital to Ankara, and New Russia did not make St. Petersburg its capital but moved its capital to Moscow. The purpose is nothing else but that those two places were too close to the imperialist forces and were easily surrounded. Therefore, the leaders of these two countries moved their capitals inland to avoid the deep blows of foreign forces on their emerging revolutionary forces. But at the same time, we must not forget that the political power of these two countries was able to stabilize, and the forces of imperialism were able to be repelled, because of the years of bloody battles fought by the people of these two countries. It was not that moving the capital and escaping the oppression of foreign forces could remove the shackles. If there had not been years of struggle, I believe that Lenin and Trotsky would have been either on the guillotine or made lifelong prisoners in Kamchatka. Where would there have been New Russia? Where would there have been the construction of the Five-Year Plan? And Kemal would certainly have been imprisoned by the Greeks on some desert island like Abd el-Krim, the Rif chieftain of Morocco. Where would there have been New Turkey? Therefore, those mechanical people who think that by establishing the capital in Beiping, the territory of North China can be preserved without resorting to armed resistance are, to put it disrespectfully, truly seeing ghosts in broad daylight. Although Beiping is surrounded by mountains and rivers, and has the danger of being a stronghold, because of its economic weakness, the constraints of the Boxer Protocol, and the fact that the railway network in the Northeast is under foreign control, warships can arrive in the morning and leave in the evening, and troops can be transported into Shanhaiguan within a few days. It is not necessary to mention Emperor Yingzong of the Ming Dynasty's "hunting at Tumubao" or Emperor Wuzong's "being trapped in Yanghe." The Qing Dynasty was captured by foreigners twice. At present, the three northeastern provinces have been lost, the six counties of Chahar have been lost, the pseudo-autonomous region of eastern Hebei has been formed, and the foreign garrison in Tianjin has been expanded. The ancient city, which has been the capital for nearly a thousand years, which many famous domestic scholars and scholars four years ago wanted to use the mercy of foreigners to close off as the so-called "cultural city," is now an isolated county, like a remaining fruit, in the hands of people, and will be picked off with just a wave of the hand. What is there to talk about the solidity of "golden walls and boiling moats"? Moreover, judging from historical precedents, losing Xulong, Hebei is a plain, with simply no danger to defend. However, readers, do not misunderstand. What I mean is not that we are willing to give up our territory, but that we should further restore our lost territory so that we have danger to defend. The current problem is not about bargaining, but about life and death. You see, what is constantly being lost is land, and what is constantly being put forward is conditions. From the Yalu River in the east to the Yin Mountains in the west, where is there a clean land? The masses of the Chinese nation, please do not forget the national crisis, please do not forget the past history. That brave soldier once stained the blood of Xifengkou. Our border poets once sang, "The border is full of Han, and the barbarian cavalry is driving south." That strategically important Juyongguan Pass, our poets also sang, "The Han family can use troops to open up exotic cities." The tomb of Zhaojun, who was rich in drama during her lifetime and still left a clod of earth after her death, our great realist poets also sang, "Once she went to the Zidai and connected to the northern Han, leaving only the green tomb facing the sunset." The historical facts woven from time and space, people and events are all our markers for driving out the soil. How to think of ways to preserve what is being lost, and how to think of ways to restore what has already been lost, are all things that every Chinese people should strive for.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Protecting the Brain is the Secret to Intelligence, Wealth, and Nobility <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>We all know that humans are the most intelligent of all creatures. Where does this intelligence ultimately reside? According to the evidence of modern scholars, our intelligence resides in the brain inside our skull. This now seems to be common knowledge. Everyone knows that the brain is the master of the human body—the source of thoughts and will.</p>
<p>The brain's specific function is to control the distribution of spirit throughout the body. Nerves branch out from the brain, encircling the entire body. All the signs of hair and fur, as well as the various parts of the body, have nerves that connect with the brain, serving as routes of communication.</p>
<p>The brain manages the movements of all parts of the human body, just as the government manages all regions. Ears can hear, eyes can see, the tongue can distinguish flavors, the lungs control breathing, the heart controls circulation, the stomach and intestines control digestion, and the movements of the limbs and hundreds of bones are all under its command. Therefore, the brain is the center of the entire nervous system—no less than a complete political organization.</p>
<p>People with sufficient brainpower are energetic and have agile thoughts. Whatever they do, they easily succeed and achieve victory. Those with weak brainpower have sluggish thoughts and slow actions, and achieve nothing. Let's take the report of Professor Todd of America on the study of human brain size as an example. He said that people with high brain size are all intelligent, wealthy, and noble, while people with low brain size are mostly poor, suffering, and untalented. From this, we can see that the relationship between brain size and intelligence is very important.</p>
<p>Symptoms of weakened brainpower include mental fatigue, weak will, memory decline, dizziness, brain emptiness, headaches, and restless sleep. Patients' thoughts easily tend towards pessimism. If life is slightly uncomfortable, tragic suicides often occur. Moreover, with such a weak body, struggling to engage in work, being able to avoid collapse is already great fortune. How can one hope to achieve great things?</p>
<p>Although there are many causes of neurasthenia, it is generally due to a lack of nutrition in the brain. Therefore, in the treatment of this condition, nourishing the brain is an important aspect. There is no specialized preparation for this type of brain-nourishing medicine on the market. Although there are many types of tonics, none of them are suitable for nourishing the brain—only "米美爾補腦法" (Mǐměi'ěr Bǔnǎo Fǎ, roughly "Mimer's Brain Nourishment Method") Memory Neurotic lives up to its name. There are indeed unique effects after reporting it. Before taking it, all the symptoms of heavy head and headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, mental discomfort, and sluggish thoughts, disappear quickly like white snow encountering the warm spring. One immediately feels clear-headed, has agile thoughts, is mentally happy, and has a strong body. Therefore, this type of brain-nourishing agent has been praised by doctors around the world as a powerful tool for protecting the brain.</p>

<h3 id="e204">There Are No Drugs in the World That Directly Kill Tuberculosis Bacteria — Written by Dr. Shen Zhaoquan <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Since tuberculosis is caused by the transmission of tuberculosis bacteria, the treatment should focus on killing the bacteria. Unfortunately, although the progress of modern medicine is rapid, an effective drug that directly kills tuberculosis bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in the lungs has not yet been invented. Various medicines and stones sold on the market for lung diseases are all for stopping coughs, eliminating phlegm, strengthening the stomach, and aiding digestion, and cannot directly kill bacteria.</p>
<p>The physiological and anatomical phenomenon of curing lung disease is that the damaged area of tuberculosis in the lungs is surrounded by human body cells and tissues, forming a scar. Then, various symptoms subside and one recovers to health. Therefore, those with vigorous physiological functions can proliferate cells to surround the diseased part, form a scar, and heal. However, patients with lung disease are mostly in a state of decline due to prolonged illness. At this time, if you want to cure tuberculosis, you can only use human power to supplement it.</p>
<p>According to research by many scholars, if you want to promote the vigorous function of physiology, the most effective way is to supplement organ therapy. Other chemical agents, no matter what, have weak effects and are not as reliable as organ preparations. The most rational and effective organ preparation of this kind is the "肺活" (Fèi Huó, roughly "Lung Activator") Phith Weal medicine produced in Germany.</p>
<p>According to the principle of curing lung disease mentioned above, "肺活" Phith Weal is made by extracting and mixing the endocrine secretions (i.e., hormones) from the fresh lungs and spleens of strong and healthy animals. Its efficacy is to invigorate physiological functions, revive deteriorated tissues, promote cell proliferation, fill in the defects of the diseased part, surround tuberculosis, and promote the formation of scars. It attacks the surrounding of the diseased part, thus losing its activity and eventually completely disappearing, and the disease is cured. Therefore, "肺活" is a well-founded, most rational, and truly effective preparation for treating lung diseases.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Problem of Curing Leukorrhea Has Been Solved! <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Lu Zhixiang</p>
<p>No formal doctor can probably answer whether gonorrhea can be cured. This is because gonorrhea is the most difficult to treat disease among venereal diseases. Its toxicity is comparable to that of syphilis, but it is even more stubborn. Although syphilis is terrible, it is not difficult to cure if treated properly. Only gonorrhea is difficult to cure once it is contracted, and it often recurs, leaving many people suffering for life. In addition, its disease is not limited to the local area, but also causes various terrible secondary or complications, putting people in a position of extreme pain. As for causing infertility, it is even more common. It is a pity that people are indifferent to this disease and do not know its harm, which is sometimes even worse than syphilis. Although there are treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and washes, patients are often unwilling to delay treatment due to various reasons such as time, economy, and face. Moreover, these therapies often do not have certain efficacy. Therefore, whether patients or doctors, the question of whether gonorrhea can be cured is always in their hearts. So was I. Until recently, I accidentally discovered a new medicine for treating gonorrhea, "九一八白濁片" ("918" Leukorrhea Tablets) "918" Anti-Gono-Tab, which can solve the problem of curing leukorrhea. I have repeatedly tested "九一八白濁片" "918" Anti-Gono-Tab on patients with acute and chronic gonorrhea, and the problem of whether gonorrhea can be cured has been satisfactorily answered. Its efficacy is that after ten gonorrhea patients use "九一八白濁片" for a considerable period of internal administration, seven or eight of them are cured, and it does not recur even after prolonged periods or overwork. From then on, this terrible gonorrhea can be cured by internal administration.</p>
<h3 id="e206">A Discussion on Curing Asthma <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Asthma is commonly known as wheezing asthma or phlegm asthma. As for its causes, although there are many theories, there is no consensus. Generally, it starts from chronic bronchitis, heart disease, chronic nephritis, and other diseases. In addition, there are also many cases of nervous asthma.</p>
<p>The treatment of asthma used to be considered a difficult disease to cure because there were no perfect medicines. Even clinical doctors felt it was difficult to treat this disease. They only temporarily relieved the pain with anesthetics (morphine and opium) during attacks. It was always difficult and hopeless to cure it so that it would not recur. However, these anesthetics should not be used frequently, for fear of poisoning. Asthma medicines sold on the market contain anesthetics, so they can take effect immediately, but if they are used every time an attack occurs, they often have the drawback of addiction. If patients buy and take this type of asthma medicine containing toxic substances, not only will they not be cured, but they will often suffer the great harm of poisoning. One must be careful.</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Humbert M.D., a medical doctor from Germany, has invented a medicine to cure asthma based on many years of experience and the latest theories, using endocrine secretions of strong and healthy animals. Its name is "哮立平" (Xiào Lì Píng, roughly "Asthma Standing Peace") Holipin, a type of oral tablet. The medicine does not contain any toxic substances. Although its efficacy is great, it has no side effects. It specifically treats all kinds of asthma in the elderly and children, asthma caused by difficulty breathing, or asthma caused by hay fever. In short, no matter what the original cause, no matter whether it is a new or long-term disease, it is effective as if by magic. If taken when an asthma attack is extremely dangerous, it can take effect immediately and have the effect of bringing the dead back to life. Those who want to implement fundamental treatment should continue to take "哮立平" for two to three months on weekdays. In general, they can be completely cured and never suffer again. If it occurs at the same time as tuberculosis, emphysema, lung atrophy, etc., in addition to taking (哮立平), also take one leaf of "肺活" JPHITH WRAL. Then the two effects will complement each other and the treatment period will be even faster.</p>

<p>— Dr. Gao De</p>
<p>If people unfortunately suffer from sexual dysfunction, not only will there be no hope for health and happiness, but problems in the family will also come in droves—making it difficult for you to solve!</p>
<p>The main cause of sexual dysfunction is masturbation. In other words, due to masturbation, the source of endocrine glands is destroyed, and the result is sexual dysfunction, such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>What is the most effective and ideal treatment for male dysfunction? First of all, what can be commonly used physiologically is the internal administration of endocrine preparations that can properly develop the reproductive organs. Among these endocrine preparations, "還爾童" (Huán'ěr Tóng, roughly "Return to Youth") Well Tonic has the greatest effect. Now that this endocrine preparation has been invented, the various local therapies mentioned above have all been completely abandoned, and the internal administration of the endocrine preparation "還爾童" Well Tonic has been changed. It is especially suitable for patients to treat themselves without any drawbacks. Moreover, this endocrine agent "還爾童" has the original power to strengthen the essence and invigorate the kidneys. It has special effects on impotence, premature ejaculation, short penis, and spermatorrhea and other reproductive dysfunctions, which no other drug can do.</p>
<p>Other treatments: Those with the bad habit of masturbation must absolutely quit. Strive to maintain health. If you can also use the nerve tonic "米美爾補腦法" Memory Neurotic at the same time to strengthen the various conditions of neurasthenia and apply appropriate treatment according to the degree, the process will definitely turn weakness into strength and re-enjoy the happiness of youth in life!</p>

<p>— Dr. Xu Shengzhang</p>
<p>As the world advances in civilization, women's interactions become more extensive, and occupational life and external stimuli increase accordingly. As a result, the consumption of mental and physical strength is also increasing day by day. Therefore, women's health maintenance should be given extra attention.</p>
<p>When women have their menstrual periods, mental overwork can easily lead to physical weakness, and the development of reproductive organs is also hindered. Therefore, working women often suffer from dysmenorrhea (i.e., painful menstruation) and female neurasthenia (also known as hysteria or melancholy). Therefore, attention must be paid to hygiene.</p>
<p>Once you find menstrual irregularities (incorrect period, excessive or insufficient menstruation, painful menstruation, amenorrhea, etc.), physical weakness, chlorosis, anemia, backache, headache, limb weakness, mental decline, abnormal temperament (mood swings), loss of appetite, insomnia at night, upside down tea eggs, palpitations, night sweats, and haggard appearance, the above are all common diseases of women. Attention must be paid to recuperation and appropriate treatment should be applied to restore health as soon as possible. If it is delayed without treatment or treated improperly, it will eventually lead to mental fatigue and physical thinness, and many will contract tuberculosis and die. Therefore, the hygiene of menstruation and the recuperation of patients must be fully considered.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a female health care agent "美奴寗" (Měi Nú Níng, roughly "Beautiful Slave Ning") Menorrin, which has special effects on female weakness and menstrual irregularities. All gynecological menstrual diseases, such as menstrual cessation, dysmenorrhea, advanced or delayed menstruation, excessive or insufficient menstrual blood, can be regulated to normal. Therefore, "美奴寗" has the miraculous effect of nourishing blood, regulating menstruation, warming the uterus, and promoting fertility.</p>
<p>"美奴寗" can also treat women's labor injuries, liver qi, bone steaming, dry blood tuberculosis, leukorrhea, and those who have had miscarriages and have blood stasis in the lower abdomen, metrorrhagia, back pain, sleeplessness, long-term infertility, as well as prenatal and postpartum diseases. It is also effective. Moreover, this product has the effect of nourishing blood and strengthening the body. After women with qi and blood deficiency take "美奴寗" Menorrin, they can turn weakness into strength, double their vitality, become mentally happy, and have active physical strength. It is especially</p>

<p>— Dr. Xu Shengzhang</p>
<p>The causes of chronic diarrhea are generally intestinal tuberculosis (intestinal consumption), bloody dysentery, food poisoning, and chronic intestinal conditions. The usual symptom is diarrhea, occurring two or three times to seven or eight times a day, sometimes mild, sometimes severe. It is often accompanied by abdominal pain, bloating, and rumbling sounds. The abdomen may also have a feeling of pressure. Stools are mixed with mucus, pus, or blood. Patients find it difficult to digest and absorb food, leading to gradual anemia, emaciation, headaches, palpitations, mental depression, and extreme weakness. If left untreated or treated improperly, it can often lead to collapse and death. The nursing and treatment methods for this disease require patients to eat easily digestible and nutritious foods, avoid overeating, and protect the abdomen from cold. Daily life should be regular. Among the medications for treatment, the most effective is "Fanyun Dysentery" tablets (DYSETRIN TAB.). When taken, this product can prevent decay and kill bacteria in the intestinal tract. If ulcers have formed in the intestinal tract, taking "Dichang Dysentery" can promote the growth of new tissue to maintain its vitality. It has a natural astringent effect to stop diarrhea, while also regulating the physiological functions of the stomach and intestines, stimulating appetite, and aiding digestion. It also has the benefit of enhancing nutrition. Therefore, doctors worldwide recognize "Dichang Dysentery" as a sacred remedy for gastrointestinal health. Furthermore, this product is non-toxic and does not harm the human body, making it suitable for both the elderly and children.</p>
<p>Note: Diarrhea caused by intestinal consumption (also known as intestinal tuberculosis) is often a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition to taking "Dichang Dysentery" tablets, it is necessary to take "Feihuo" (Phith Weal), a special lung treatment, simultaneously for even more significant and faster results.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Cause and Remedy for Insufficient Breast Milk <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Bo Xiuzhen</p>
<p>Insufficient breast milk is generally caused by poor maternal nutrition or abnormal mental stimuli. Pregnant women should take responsibility for breastfeeding their infants after giving birth. Therefore, insufficient or no breast milk after childbirth is a major misfortune for the child. To remedy insufficient breast milk, mothers should always maintain their physical and mental well-being. Galactagogues, such as "Mamato" (Mammato), a glandular preparation, can be taken to enhance mammary gland function and promote vigorous secretion, and can increase the nutritional components in breast milk, leading to healthier and more active infants and rapid development.</p>
<p>If the mother is exceptionally weak and severely deficient in qi and blood, the medicine "Menorrin" can be taken, which has special effects in replenishing blood and regulating weakness. It can also promote blood circulation, prevent premature aging, and enhance beauty. Many young women in Europe and America commonly use it as a dietary supplement for regulating menstruation and maintaining health.</p>

<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident, this day of bloody remembrance, is its fifth anniversary today. In these five years, what has become of our country? We need not say more; the stark facts are laid out before us. On this tragic anniversary, my emotions are too agitated, and I simply cannot think of what words to use to express what I want to say. (I think every compatriot, except those who willingly become slaves and accomplices of tigers, feels this way!) Furthermore, this blood debt will definitely not be settled simply by remembering it on the anniversary. "Drinking cold water in winter, every drop is remembered in the heart." We will definitely not forget the "cold water" in ordinary times, but on this tragic anniversary, it only further evokes the situation when we "drank cold water" and makes us think with shame: Oh, it has been a full five years!</p>
<p>Today, five years later, I do not want to say much. I just want to give a warning to my compatriots: The greatest "humiliation" ("humiliation" is not quite appropriate, because in reality this is a matter of "survival" for each of us, and cannot be summed up by such an abstract conceptual noun). We have "endured humiliation and carried heavy burdens" for five years. The "humiliation" of the past five years has not only not lessened but has also increased. Therefore, the focus of the problem now is not on how to wash away the "humiliation" of the past but on how to prevent the "humiliation" from increasing. Of course, we know and believe that this is a dual problem, and a solution cannot be achieved by solving it separately.</p>
<p>For this reason, I would just like to copy some recent news reports below to let us see what the situation is like today, five years later, and how it will develop.</p>
<p>To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the September 18th Incident and to encourage people to immigrate to Manchuria, the Japanese Army, the Colonial Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry Ministries, the "Manchukuo" Concord Association, the Manchurian Immigration Association, etc., are holding a grand Immigration Propaganda Week from yesterday to the 18th. Immigration lecture meetings are being held throughout the country. The General Staff Headquarters of the Army Ministry, the Agriculture and Forestry, Colonial Affairs, and Finance Ministries, the Manchurian Affairs Bureau, and the South Manchurian Railway Company have sent personnel to form ten lecture teams to tour and give lectures. At the same time, film screenings of the September 18th Incident and symposiums on the September 18th Incident are being held to promote militaristic thought and encourage people to invade foreign countries. Currently, local veterans associations, youth groups, and national defense women's associations are also actively engaged in propaganda. (Tokyo dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the September 18th Incident, the Japanese authorities are holding a general mobilization of outdoor exercises for students in Dalian on that day. Approximately 3,500 people will participate, starting at 5:30 am. The East and West armies will use China as a hypothetical enemy to perform a heroic attack. (Dalian dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>This is about "commemoration," and we can already see how different things are. Let's set this aside and take a look at how others are "supporting" us to end this article.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 13th, several heavy trucks flying a certain country's flag, fully loaded with cotton yarn and carrying several people from that country, were driving on the Baojia Highway... The Japanese textile industry has recently been actively expanding its business in Tianjin. Previously, Kanegafuchi Spinning Co. purchased the Yuyuan and Huaxin yarn factories, and Toyo Spinning Co. purchased Yufeng, renovating the factory's interior and expanding its business. Now, Shanghai Spinning Co. also has plans to advance north... As a result of negotiations with the Chinese side, it has been decided to purchase 70,000 ping of land... It is said that the construction of the factory will begin next spring and will be completed by the end of the year. (Tianjin dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>The number of Japanese inspecting North China has recently increased sharply. In the past, most went to China alone, but recently they have been organizing groups, especially inspection groups dispatched by various chambers of commerce and industry... (Tianjin dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Finally, I must add one more unnecessary comment, which is that due to space constraints, the news reports excerpted above are only some of the very brief ones seen in the newspapers. I would like to ask readers to go and read the others themselves. Fortunately, they are everywhere. Moreover, in the above, we can really "see the whole leopard through one spot."</p>

<p>— Sheli</p>
<p>But Dad hasn't even seen the little thing's face!</p>
<p>Long ago, he had this idea:</p>
<p>Get some money, take a photo, and send it to the distant home!</p>
<p>To this day, this idea has not been realized, which makes him very painful. He works as a errand boy in a usury company opened by an Indian boss. When the debtor's date arrives, regardless of winter or summer, near or far, he has to run to that house to collect the debt. Sometimes when he runs back, his legs are so sore and numb that they don't feel like his own. Too tired? His annual salary is only thirty yuan.</p>
<p>Thirty yuan, he has to supplement his shoes and socks, and he has to send money home. Where would he have the money to take a photo?</p>
<p>He is getting older with worry!</p>
<p>When he is down, he comes to me, opens the conversation box, stiffly, it is always the same old story: how good his hometown is, how obedient his wife is, he has no money to take a photo, he dreamed of that little thing again last night...</p>
<p>Perhaps after reciting that set, he will hum Qinqiang opera.</p>
<p>But these days, he hasn't sung Qinqiang opera for a long time. He is getting thinner, his face is like the sky in the yellow plum season, gloomy. And he doesn't talk much anymore, keeping his mouth closed all the time.</p>
<p>I am really worried that he will fall ill.</p>
<p>"Buddy! Let me tell you, I guess I'm having a lucky streak. Yesterday the boss suddenly called me over. Guess what's up?"</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, he came to me, his face much brighter, and after telling me these few words, he kept me in suspense.</p>
<p>"A bonus?"</p>
<p>"No, no!"</p>
<p>He smiled and denied it. Then he told me: He was told to collect a debt. The other party was a tough nut to crack and refused to pay after several attempts. This time, the boss lost his temper and told him to take care of this matter: if soft tactics don't work, use hard ones; if hard ones don't work, take him to the company. At any rate, he had to squeeze oil out of him this time. Finally, he said: Isn't it my lucky streak? The boss promised in person: If I get the money, I'll split it two-eight with me.</p>
<p>"This time you should be able to take a photo."</p>
<p>He chuckled and left.</p>
<p>Today I saw him in this room again.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed, still old, and the wrinkles on his face seem to be deeper, with a bruise around his eye.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, with your eye?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the corner of his left eye.</p>
<p>He coughed, with a sigh, and shook his head repeatedly:</p>
<p>"This, this was hit by that rascal. Damn it, that rascal, really fierce, didn't pay the money and even hit people! He hit my eye."</p>
<p>"What happened then?"</p>
<p>"Later, I and a buddy dragged him to the company."</p>
<p>"Then the boss must have given you a bonus."</p>
<p>As if my words had touched his sore spot, he stood up abruptly, and a furious light flashed in his small eyes.</p>
<p>"Damn it! That heartless bastard! I got hurt, and he said I was useless and fired me."</p>
<p>After a while, his anger turned into sorrow, and he suddenly sighed!</p>
<p>"When can I take a photo?"</p>
<p>Then he coughed again, his face flushed red, and the veins on his forehead bulged like earthworms.</p>
<p>In his series of coughs, I seemed to hear the groan of a dying man. (The End)</p>

<p>— Ding Ni</p>
<p>Called Semi-Qualified Scholar wrote "Xinglong Restaurant" in three lines of regular script on three square-cut red papers, and just covered the faded "Daxing Restaurant" on the old signboard. Hang up four red cloth lanterns, the atmosphere of a new shop.</p>
<p>On a counter by the threshold, green stone jars are piled as high as small graves, all full, soy-stewed ribs, sprouted beans, steaming with different flavors? Directly drilling into people's noses. On the blue-and-white dishes, there are also several kinds of side dishes. A drunkard carrying five taels of dregs-burned wine, with two fingers as dirty as fire citrus, took some chili-fried shredded meat without meat, put it in his mouth and chewed for a while. It seemed not enough to play, so he took some more something and put it in his mouth and chewed. Only then did he take a plate of sprouted beans, which he seemed to have decided on long ago, and ran in.</p>
<p>"If there were a band of musicians, how lively it would be." Wang Boss, sitting on a high stool by the counter, thought so, and concealed the trace of a smile that he had just shown while looking at the four red lanterns. However, thinking that he had been working as a shop assistant for others for these years, and he actually had a day to start his own business and open a shop, he smiled again!</p>
<p>Huang Pang hit the iron pot loudly, without any melody. The waiter responded with a "Hey," and brought in the soup noodles that had been cooked on the stove. He put the lard into the red-hot empty pot and put in some raw materials and covered it. Then, he stretched out an arm, whose sweat hair had been burned off by the stove fire, and picked up a pot full of noodles, skillfully dividing it into coarse bowls that were smaller than basins placed on the stove, one bowl after another.</p>
<p>"Holding a pot full of noodles as if it's nothing, his arm is really strong. But, who was the bastard who gave him the nickname Huang Pang?" Boss Wang felt a little injustice for his capable stove clerk.</p>
<p>A group of customers taking it with them (Note 1) with coarse bowls of soup noodles were talking quietly and left cheaply. Then, another group of coarse bowls was brought up, shouting "Next bowl of soup noodles"!</p>
<p>Counting twenty-two coppers, and then counting twenty-two coppers. Boss Wang felt that the soup noodle business today was not bad. He suddenly wondered why his waiter, who was like a lark, was not so energetic. He turned around to see what the old man was doing? What was he doing? The lark was holding a teacup, slowly sipping tea. There were two customers in the hall, one was a drunkard that Boss Wang knew, and the other was eating soup noodles, sweating profusely. Boss Wang originally wanted to reprimand the waiter, but seeing the situation, he didn't say anything.</p>
<p>Why are there so few dine-in (Note 2) customers? Dim sum shops all rely on a lot of dine-in customers to make some money. Today's soup noodle business is a loss-making business! Boss Wang looked worriedly at the pile of coppers in the drawer, "Not even a dime has been seen for half a day. If this goes on, won't we have to close the door"?</p>
<p>He pondered hard, for a long time before he opened his eyelids. A plan to keep the shop open remained in his mind: "Bring his wife out from the countryside and let her manage the shop, and he would be the waiter himself, wouldn't that work"?</p>
<p>At this time, a person in a Western suit ran into the shop, followed by a person in a short shirt. Boss Wang thought they were big customers and was about to stand up to greet them. The person in the Western suit said loudly, "Boss, how about what I told you this morning"?</p>
<p>When Boss Wang saw that it was the garbage collector, he became anxious in his heart. But he immediately squeezed out a smile, "Please sit! Please sit! Waiter, pour tea!</p>
<p>"No need to be polite." The garbage collector didn't sit down, and put the tea handed over by the waiter aside: "How is it? Tell me"? Then, he pulled Boss Wang to the back door and said softly, "This is the rule, every new shop can't escape it, and..."</p>
<p>"But, sir, all my capital has been spent. Business is not good today, and I only earned four or five yuan..."</p>
<p>"Don't say it! If you say it like this, I still have to lend you some capital"? The garbage collector's tone became fierce: "What's it going to be"?</p>
<p>"Sir, there's really no way, I have to ask you to forgive me"!</p>
<p>"Hmph! You can't get the walnut meat out if you don't knock"! The garbage collector ran to the door: "Come! This braised chicken is already ruined. There are flies on that rib. It's unsanitary, pour it out."</p>
<p>The person following the garbage collector held two jars of things to pour out, Boss Wang wanted to stop him, but he was pushed away by the garbage collector. The two jars of things slammed into the dog-chewing bucket (Note 3).</p>
<p>"And the chimney hood above is not well made, which is harmful to hygiene. I'll give you a deadline to redo it tomorrow. If it's not done when I come to see it tomorrow, don't blame me!"</p>
<p>Two tears hung on the corner of Boss Wang's eyes, and he stared blankly at the dog-chewing bucket.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Taking it with them to buy.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Running to the shop to eat.</p>
<p>(Note 3) A bucket for holding the leftovers of the diners.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Duck <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The sun had already fallen into the mountains across the way, and a glow of sunset dyed the sky red. Wisps of black smoke were blowing out of the chimneys on every thatched roof. It was suppertime.</p>
<p>Granny Zhu, a widowed old woman, was holding a thin bamboo pole and standing by the river, "Hoo, hoo" driving the ducks into the pen. Those ducks were caught in the summer, and now they have grown red feet and shiny feathers, finding food for themselves in the small stream. Hearing Granny Zhu's "Hoo, hoo" sound, they lined up in a line, quacking, and walked ashore one after another. Following Granny Zhu's thin bamboo pole gently waved, like children knowing their own home, wobbling along the embankment.</p>
<p>Granny Zhu, like a military officer, stood at the end, still making "Hoo, hoo" sounds in her mouth. Passing Aunt Li's door, Aunt Li had just finished eating dinner with her son and wanted to move the table and stools back to the house to sleep.</p>
<p>"Granny, those ducks are growing up."</p>
<p>Aunt Li respected Granny Zhu the most, saying that she was a widowed old woman relying on spinning and weaving, raising chickens and ducks to make a living. Even a man probably didn't have her skills. Therefore, Aunt Li was the one who got along best with Granny in this pond. She often said to those pond people who looked down on the widowed old woman: It's also a hard life to be a widowed old woman. She doesn't break the law, doesn't rob or steal. Seeing how hard-working and diligent she is, if she were a man, she would probably be a great old man! Stop saying that you're unlucky to meet a widowed old woman, you can't even find such a widowed old woman with a lantern.</p>
<p>When Granny Zhu heard Aunt's Li's words, she immediately slowed down her pace and said, "Yes, thanks to the pond for having a lot of oil and water (fish, shrimp, etc.), and the snails are also cheap. If there was a duck plague like last year, this old woman's bones wouldn't have anywhere to bury!"</p>
<p>Saying that, Granny Zhu also laughed herself. She wasn't laughing that her words were too blunt, she was laughing that the group of ducks had gathered at her doorstep, quacking, they were waiting for a hearty dinner.</p>
<p>"Aunt, your Genfu likes to eat duck, I'll send one over in a few days."</p>
<p>"No, no! You raise them so hard, how can I be embarrassed to eat yours? Just let me have a small one, to satisfy A Gen's mouth."</p>
<p>Granny Zhu didn't listen to her, and hurried onto the pond embankment. A basket of snails had already been placed at her door, and the group of ducks were surrounding the basket, quacking. But Granny helped with this hearty dinner, the ducks didn't see it as easily as swallowing a small fish flipping over in the pond. Granny Zhu sat on the stool, first counting whether any were missing, then picked up the one closest to her, held its belly to see if it was full, and then opened its mouth to stuff as many snails as possible. Then she put it into the bamboo cage. The ducks were stuffed with snails, all swollen in their small necks, and then they quacked and fluttered in the cage, until those snails were sent into their stomachs, and then they comfortably waited in the cage for Granny to send them to the pen, like a person who had finished dinner.</p>
<p>One by one, stuffing snails, the sky was already completely dark without her realizing it. Granny Zhu stretched lazily from the stool, fumbled into the house in the dark, lit a torch (a simple light), went back out to carry the cage back to the pen, and then went to the door with peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>She only cooked one meal for lunch and ate cold rice soaked in hot water in the evening. However, she was too tired, and sometimes she would lie down on the bed after serving the ducks, she needed rest more than eating.</p>
<p>Today she was very happy, the ducks had all grown up, and none of them had died. In a few days, the restaurants in the town would send someone to the pond to collect the ducks, and she could sell a lot of money. Those ducks had cost her a lot of effort to raise from catching them to this size. With this money, she could rest for a while in the autumn and then spin yarn in the winter. Thinking about it, she went to the duck pen again to inspect it, to see if the paper paste on the door was twisted, those hateful weasels often dragged away her ducks and chicks.</p>
<p>She didn't even want a little dish with the cold rice soaked in hot water, and she swallowed two bowls of rice quickly. With a happy heart, she went to bed. Perhaps Granny Zhu would have a happy dream tonight, dreaming that her son came back and she was no longer a widowed old woman.</p>

<p>— Yago</p>
<p>——A Record of the Jin River——</p>
<p>The thick pillars trembled amidst the white poplars and reeds; a dull, gray mist began to permeate the Jin River. In the reeds, the wind flew past, disturbing flocks of wild ducks, which whirled in the air in alarm, only to disappear into another clump of reeds. Raindrops slanted onto the calm water surface, shuddering for a moment before turning into clusters of ripples, expanding and rippling. Dozens or hundreds of them collided, forming a small wave, which drifted far away with the wind, striking the hull of the boat and emitting a low, mournful sound.</p>
<p>The boatman, wearing a disgruntled expression, climbed into the cabin and said that the wind had picked up on the river and the rain was falling so heavily that they could no longer travel. They would have to wait for the wind and rain to pass before continuing. We thought about it: it was indeed dangerous to travel in a storm. Hadn't we seen a report in the newspaper just a few days ago about a hurricane heading towards the China Sea? So we agreed.</p>
<p>The boatman steered the boat to the shore, dropping anchor under a row of white poplar trees and mooring. After furling the sail, he climbed into the cabin, sat down, and began to smoke his small pipe.</p>
<p>The rain continued to patter, striking the thin iron sheet of the boat canopy and producing crisp sounds. We all lay quietly in our berths, listening to the sharp whistling of the wind and the sound of the rain, which powerfully absorbed our thoughts.</p>
<p>Gradually, the sound of the rain became more sparse and slow, but the wind continued to blow. The boatman tapped his pipe on the boat plank, knocked out the ashes, and extinguished the remaining sparks with his foot. He then silently climbed out, stood on the deck, turned back to us, and said in a low voice: "The rain is about to stop..."</p>
<p>He was silent, as if listening to something. Before long, his hands suddenly began to tremble, his face turned pale, and his mouth convulsed. He climbed into the cabin, looking at everyone with uneasy and bewildered eyes.</p>
<p>His sudden change of movement made me curious, so I questioned him. He frowned deeply and said in a worried tone:</p>
<p>"This is beyond our control, sir..." He then paused to think, tilting one ear and listening intently. We, too, seemed to be influenced and paid attention. A kind of noisy sound, faint and soft, was echoing in the distance, sometimes becoming so bright and clear, and sometimes quietly fading away.</p>
<p>"It's a kind of shouting..." the boatman murmured in a pained tone.</p>
<p>"And it sounds like it's coming from a woman's throat..." I added.</p>
<p>The boatman shrugged uneasily and climbed out again, standing quietly at the hatch. We followed as if drawn by something.</p>
<p>The rain had stopped, and fine raindrops were still drifting. The sky was very verdant, tinged with blue. On the deck, we cautiously followed the sound, searching in that direction; but we saw nothing.</p>
<p>"Over there, look..." The boatman turned back, pointing far away with his hand. We followed his gaze and, yes, over there, facing the Jin River, was a small village of seven or eight farmhouses arranged in a row. In front of the houses was a long threshing ground. The ground was empty and desolate, but at this moment, more than a dozen people in gray clothes were coming out of one of the houses in a single file. They were all disheveled, bareheaded, their faces flushed red. Some held a chicken in their hands (which often struggled, flapping its wings and crying mournfully); others were still waving a bayonet in the air menacingly. They staggered and bumped into each other as if drunk. On the other side, three people were pumping their short legs, chasing a young and thin woman. Her hair and long skirt fluttered high in the air, and she emitted rapid and hurried cries, running around the threshing ground and dashing through the fields...</p>
<p>"They are chasing that woman..." the boatman said in a distressed tone, with a hint of despair.</p>
<p>"Who are they?" I asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"The XX Volunteer Corps stationed in the nearby village... There's a large detachment in Huangtang, and a small detachment in Jiujiaowan, this one belongs to Huangtang. Here, they often run into farmhouses for no reason, stealing everything they can see and get, and some go after young women..." After saying this, he looked up at the azure sky with a worried expression, muttering: "The rain has stopped, let's go!..."</p>
<p>Looking up, the rain threads were gone, and a cluster of sunlight was shining in the clouds.</p>

<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>After throwing the third cigarette butt into the spittoon, the clock held in the goddess's hand struck ten times like a lark. I rubbed my hands and felt that I should say goodbye to the host.</p>
<p>The hostess had just stood up from the sofa next to the host. She yawned, perhaps wanting to go to the back room, but seeing that I had picked up my hat and was about to leave, she returned to the sofa and said before I could:</p>
<p>"Mr. X, won't you sit a little longer?" Her eyes rolled as she glanced at the goddess holding the clock. "It's ten o'clock already. — Do you have some kind of meeting?"</p>
<p>She tilted her head and rolled onto the back of the sofa where her husband was sitting, laughing playfully.</p>
<p>"Nothing going on, right?" her husband asked me seriously. "It's raining heavily outside."</p>
<p>He handed me a cigarette.</p>
<p>There was nothing going on, I just thought about finding this young couple to escape a lonely evening. Speaking of which, the evenings in Shanghai are not lonely at all, on the contrary, they are just the beginning of the fun? On the one hand, I am indeed too poor to afford to buy women's smiles, or go to the theater to listen to plays that I don't understand, and everywhere else shows that the evenings in Shanghai are not lonely. Then, it is lively enough in my apartment, with the singing of street girls downstairs, the comrades playing mahjong in the next room making a racket, and the women who come to each door to solicit business, often causing laughter and applause... The whole apartment is lively, it is a corner of Shanghai — no, it is exactly the prototype of Shanghai! However, my heart is lonely, and I feel that the evenings in Shanghai are too lonely.</p>
<p>Walking out of the apartment door, a few raindrops were already falling from the sky. I lowered my head, walking along the desolate road, following my own shadow. As the noisy sounds gradually faded away, I felt refreshed and wanted to do something. — Actually, this is not accurate, every day there are many things piled up in my head, and I need to finish them quickly, because a new lot of things will pile up in my head the next day. But I always let them pile up, pile up, until my brain swells with pain; finally, when I really want to do something, I can't sort things out clearly. So, I hesitate again, increasing [the pile], and I no longer have the desire to do anything. Therefore, what I am talking about now, wanting to do something, is very, very small in scope, like finding a friend to chat with. Thinking like this, when I passed my friend's house, I did not hesitate to ring his doorbell.</p>
<p>He was an old classmate from our middle school. In school, our relationship was very good, because we both participated in the parade of the Nanjing Road blood incident, and we were both arrested. We held hands tightly in the detention center, smiling silently at each other. But after graduation, we went down two different paths. He went to university, and after graduating, he married a young and beautiful wife. With the help of his wealthy father, he used the loan to become a compradore, which is naturally a very comfortable occupation. I did not advance to university, and the jobs I found were all short-term, and unemployment often gripped me like a snake that would not let go. Although I was one of the guests at his wedding, with my poor appearance I no longer had the courage to visit him in his new home. Today, I didn't seem to be thinking about these things.</p>
<p>After the servant went in to inform him, my friend came out to greet me himself, shaking my hand tightly, just like before. He invited me upstairs to his bedroom, introduced me to his newlywed wife, and said with a smile: "You've come at the right time, we're too lonely. Listen, at night, this place is like a deserted temple, although there's a radio in the east and a radio in the west, these things are the most annoying."</p>
<p>He finished speaking in one breath and then added, "Come and chat often when you have time."</p>
<p>I smiled and accepted the cigarette handed to me by his wife. Sitting on the soft sofa, I looked around this luxurious bedroom and thought, could they also feel lonely? It is true that this place is like a deserted temple, there are special signs on the roads in the residential area that prohibit honking car horns, but can't they use money to buy the liveliness of Shanghai? They don't seem to belong to the lonely group.</p>
<p>Talking, my friend revealed the reason for his loneliness.</p>
<p>"It's really tiring to live in Shanghai, dance halls, movie theaters... it's always the same. At night, it's like there's no place to put this body. Staying at home..."</p>
<p>He shook his head, not saying anything, probably because it would be too wasteful of this good evening, so he welcomed me to chat. But our loneliness is the same, but our paths are different, neither of us can solve this difficult problem for the other, or perhaps after talking more, it will increase each other's loneliness. After taking the fourth cigarette he handed me, I stood up to say goodbye.</p>
<p>"I've disturbed you a lot, you should go to sleep too."</p>
<p>His wife pouted at me, as if she guessed that I had some kind of appointment, wasn't it raining heavily outside?</p>
<p>"I wouldn't keep you if you had something to do." My friend shook my hand tightly, just like before. "Come and chat when you have time, I'm home more often in the evenings."</p>
<p>It was raining heavily outside, and because it was a residential area, no rickshaws passed by. I walked in the rain, letting the large raindrops hit my face, hands, and body. Perhaps this rain could relieve some of my loneliness.</p>

<p>September 18th</p>
<p>XX inflicts poisonous calamity on China. Such a great provincial capital is ruined overnight. The three words become a timeless regret. Ten thousand people share a hundred years of shame. Thinking of the day when this turmoil began. Unknowingly, time flies and five autumns have passed. The years pass easily like flowing water. When will this endless hatred cease? The righteous army unfortunately suffered dispersal. Alas, the heroes' aspirations have not been fulfilled. The traces of villages and mounds are still there. The Yellow Dragon has not been slaked, and the regret is lingering. Alas, the blood of ten thousand men. Is exchanged for a few earthen mounds. Truly, the cold moon and dusk are when foxes and rabbits weep. A bleak wind and bitter rain lament the desolate mound. Fearing that the past will become a relic. Dare to use this writing to awaken sleeping gulls. Stop hesitating. Stop idling. The strong neighbor may not be willing to retract his ambitions.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>May our compatriots cherish their hearts, love the country, and make strong efforts. With the ambition to turn the tide and avenge the great enemy. Lying on firewood and tasting gall must be remembered. By no means should we deceive others with superficial gestures. Empty words entrusted to the wind have no practical effect. Five minutes of enthusiasm brings shame. From now on, do not tread the original path again. Moreover, do not be in a prosperous place with no foresight. I only hope that the Han flag will be hung on the three borders soon. Let the barbarian horses not linger for long. Eliminate national humiliation and secure our homes. Then we can share wine and dispel all the sorrows of the ages. If we can achieve the hegemony of peace in one fell swoop. Our mighty name will shake other continents. May the Republic of China last forever. (Mimi Some Bottle Published Number)</p>

<p>In the past, Hollywood's male star Ramon Novarro was considered the most handsome man by women all over the world. But now everyone's attention has shifted to Robert Taylor. Indeed, he is a rare talent for young male roles. Now he is co-starring with Loretta Young in a film called "Lake Mountain Spring Warmth" Secret Intenlude, which is scheduled to be released at Grand Light starting today (Friday), which may be good news for movie fans. The story of the film depicts a romance between a young master and a maid, and fiercely attacks the concept of class marriage, which must be a work most welcomed by young lovers. As for these two famous actors, playing such a love drama is of course their forte.</p>

<p>Since the reopening of the Nanjing Grand Theater last month, blockbuster films have come one after another. After "Rage", "Spring in the Forbidden City" and "San Francisco", it is now showing RKO's "Runaway Bride". The film stars the beautiful actress Barbara Stanwyck, with the handsome young actor Gene Raymond and "Playboy" protagonist Robert Young in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a young couple who meet by chance and get married; the woman does not want to do things too hastily, so on the day of the wedding, an unexpected twist occurs, and the groom tastes the taste of iron bars before entering the gentle village. The plot is bizarre and full of jokes. It is indeed a good medicine for the modern way of love; as for the humor of the discount and the exquisite sound and light configuration, it is still a trivial matter of the film.</p>

<p>Since the Paris Grand Theater gained the screening rights of the six major companies, it has selected the best of the best, and every film is a blockbuster. As evidenced by "Little Heroine", which will be released today. The film is Shirley Temple's most successful work since she stepped onto the silver screen, and has broken all previous box office records. The film tells the story of a revolutionary daughter who is only six years old, who knows no fear, disregards danger, and only knows how to defend the land and resist the enemy, breaking the enemy's heart and moving the president to tears. It is both serious and humorous, and is a good teacher and friend for children today. In order to prevent crowding, the theater will add a show at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
