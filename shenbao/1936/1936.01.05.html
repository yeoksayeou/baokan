<p>— 華</p>
<p>在一九三六年的年頭我們雖然從世界各地聽到了許多祈求和平的呼聲但是舊年所遺下來的恐慌與危機到新年仍復如故强暴侵略者的氣燄沒有隨着年歲的更易而稍减軍國主義的狂潮只有與時間的推進而益烈種種國際的發展似乎儘在把世界拖向戰爭這種發展中最可注意的一步是日德的軍事同盟這消息由法國「人道報」傳之於前蘇聯塔斯通訊社揭露之於後雖經日人方面非正式的吾認但照各種情勢推測起來這在事實上不是沒有可能的因爲我們關切於世界的和平現在應把這問題考察一下</p>
<p>日德同盟的傳說不是從最近才發生的在過去一年中已經傳出過數决最先是去年初東京盛傳將以滿洲的大豆交換德國的徐柏林飛船這當然是同盟勾結的初步到三月底日本退出國聯日內瓦方面的觀察以爲日德關係將更接近在六月底正當艾登訪問英斯科的時候德國也有一個考察國出發東來遊歷口滿一時國際間都集中注意於日德同盟的發展後來因爲意阿戰爭爆發世界的目光轉注於東非及地中海關於德國的考察團在日本與滿洲的活動遂爲一般人所忽略但在車實上因爲東非戰爭延不結東國際局勢益加動盪不安日德黷武勢力的勾結便也進行得不遺餘力德國考察團於十二月初抵偽國在哈爾濱曾提議創設一公司以機器材料供給僞國且從偽國直接採購大豆同時更建議締結德「滿」商約祗因爲日方無意於此未有成功另一方而據法報的消息日本武官與希脫勒顧問里本脫洛浦在柏林也進行談判所謂「軍事同盟」的促成大概是在這方面决定的</p>
<p>根據上述的種種線索可知日德同盟的傳說不是完全無因的而且就目前的情勢說日德同爲貧乏的帝國主義同爲軍國主義氣燄暴張的國家同爲國聯的叛徒亦同爲國際和平條的的撕毀者兩者在聲氣上可以相投的在向外擴展勢力的政策上他們也同樣可以用反蘇聯的旗幟緩和其他帝國主義的反對最近傳說的軍事同盟實際上就是以一個反蘇聯的同盟爲掩護的不過這樣的掩護雖極巧妙而因爲日德的結合對於國際局勢影響的重大並不能减少各國對於它的重視日德軍事同盟果成事實則德國在歐洲的勢力必增强這對於法國集團是一種威脅他們常然耍堅持反對幷和蘇聯造成更密切的團結以謀對抗同時日本在東方的勢力盎加增强了對於英美的利益必有重大的妨害特別是美國他當然要表示反對的態度就我國的立塲說日德同盟正似第一次大戰前的英日同盟其唯一受害者爲我國英日同盟爲佈置第一决大戰的一個前奏目前的日德同盟的推進當然也就是第二次大戰的一個先聲我們爲自己國家民族的利益計爲東亞以至世界的和平計都要加以堅决的反對的</p>

<p>莫斯科　莫斯科各報載「蒙古人民共和國」總理庚登對莫斯科各報記者談話、庚登答覆記者詢問、謂：「去年日滿軍在蒙古人民共和國邊境之行動、已足顯示彼等侵略之本性及企圖、蒙古人民以其巨大之代價、犧牲及艱苦奮鬥、創造其自由與獨立生活、迄今已十四年、余等從事於和平建設、致力於發展國民經濟、並提高人民之文化水準及物質生活、」</p>
<p>「偽滿成立之前、余等向無邊疆衝突、享受獨立之和平生活、然自日軍來滿、情勢激變、”滿軍竟攻擊余等邊境、掠奪蒙古人民北和國之土地、余等屢求和平生活、屢謀得一和平協定、但均失敗、」</p>
<p>庚登繼謂日本侵略之目的、首先爲使蒙古人民共和國失去獨立、戍爲第二「滿洲國」、以便繼續向中國及蘇聯進攻、「余等不願屈服、但願保障余等之邊境及獨立、余等可以預言、在蒙古共和國受日滿軍攻擊之際、必將引起共他各國更巨大之反響、」</p>
<p>庚登且述此次蒙古代表團來莫斯科之感想、謂「余等與偉大之蘇聯保持密切友好關係、且常受最熱烈之愛護及援助、蒙古每一牧人均知蘇聯爲余等之好友、　彼等深願蒙古得以和平發展、　且知當余等爲侵略者進攻之犧牲之際、　彼等必能出而援助、余來莫斯科、將欲解决若干日常問題、」</p>
<p>最後庚登述去年十二月十九日日滿軍之襲擊滿古邊境、謂「余等已聞彼等準備再作襲擊、余等已向「滿洲國」警告、如再作此等襲擊、　則其所引起之嚴重結果、　當由日滿負資、　余等自當保障余等之獨立、不許受人攻擊、余等已有此能力及决心、」</p>

<h3 id="c56">談紅葉 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 中國科學社主編　張楚寶</p>
<p>一向在都市中生活的人，煩囂穢濁的空氣，把人窒息得非常不痛快，當他們步上了汕綠的草地，賞望着靑枝綠葉，不由的會深深的吐一口氣，覺得心曠神怡而感到一種新鮮的氣息。原來綠色對於人的感官，最能使它發生快戚，樹木在形態上展示可親的綠色，在生理上又因爲綠葉中含有一種葉綠素（Chlorophyll，）能够吸收人們排出的炭酸氣，而發生人們呼吸所必需的養氣，所以常和樹林接近的人，比起一般人來，會要健康些的。</p>
<p>季節由妝春·仲春·進到了初夏·盛夏，樹葉也隨着由黃綠·淺綠·而濃綠……一天一天的加深，終至秋天來到了人間，可憐的綠葉，經不起秋風的壓迫，逐漸失去它昔日的光輝，單上一層暗淡的顏色，綠色慢慢的消褪，黃色或紅色便來取而代其位置，這是樹木凄凉的時代，「人老珠黃不値錢」，樹木到了這時候，也大有這種情調。可是我們在這時候往山林裏一看，紅光閃耀，滿山照得如火如荼，人們便又戚到另一種情趣，「看紅葉去」成了秋季應時的舉動。我們現在不去效文學家咏詩爲文，欣賞紅葉，讓我們從科學的立塲來談談關於紅葉的種種。</p>
<p>第一，我們先問紅葉是怎樣成功的？紅葉的形成，是由于葉子的細胞當中含有一種花靑素（Anthocyan或Anthocyanin)。花靑素常存在于植物的花·葉·莖·葉　或是根裏面，使它們顯出紅色·靑色　或者紫色，而且常把葉裏面所含的葉綠素的綠色遮掉，純粹顯出這些顏色來。花靑素和葉綠素都是細胞中所含的微粒（Pigments），它們時常同時存在一起，都是可以溶解在水酒精·或是醚裏面的，據Livingston和Maximovil氏說：當這種溶液從酸性變到中性或鹼性的時候，顏色也會由紅色變到紫色或靑色，卽顏色的變化乃由于酸度變化的關係。據Harvey氏說，花靑素和糖原質（Glucosides爲存于植物體中之葡萄糖誘導體，由鹼·酸或酵素的作用，分解而爲葡萄糖·酒精或其他化合物質）有關，並且有相同的功能：花靑素的形成，卽賴有葡萄糖的存在。通常每當環境適于使細胞中產生濃度較大之葡萄糖時，例如低溫度，曝露等，花靑素的發生便更豐富，這或許可以用來解釋何以紅葉多見於天氣較冷的初春和秋季了。</p>
<p>我們旣然知道紅葉構成的原因，其决我們便耍問：葉紅的意義何在？葉變紅究含有什麼作用？我們知道紅葉有兩種形態，一種是常態的紅葉，一種是變種的紅葉，秋海棠·紫萬年靑·葉的裏而呈紅色，一品紅（一名猩猩木），雁來紅等花部附近的葉全部或一部呈紅色，它們都屬于常態的紅葉，不過目的各有不同，鴈來紅·一品紅等的紅葉，學者公認係在指示昆虫以花的所在，傳導花粉；但秋海棠·紫萬年靑則據說便不是這樣了。大概紅色僅存在葉的表面的，可說是爲防禦過强的日光，减少蒸發，而紅色在裏面的則並不如是。爪哇森林內的植物有許多是早紅色的，林內的空氣非常濕潤，說它是防日照蒸發，自然不適當，所以Stahl　氏却解釋這是爲了要多吸收熱度大的赤色光綫，以增進蒸發作用，則目的恰又與前項解說相反了。變態的紅葉就是我現在所要提出的春季和秋季所見的紅葉了。（未完）</p>

<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統今晚向國會發表常年咨文、將一九三三年年初與目前之世界大勢、作一概括之比較、</p>
<p>總統向兩院聯席會議追述其一九三三年三月四日之就職宣言稱、當時之危機、純屬國家性質、理想中之世界係一和平之幻影並合理的希望撤除互信及貿易途中之障礙、自茲以後、善鄰政策瀰漫於西半球、至於世界之其他部份、則你傾我軋、良堪浩嘆、自一九三三年夏季以降、歐亞兩洲多數大國統治者之方針、迄未昭示和平與人類親善應循之途徑、遂至美國人民不得不承認惡感之滋長、侵略之趨勢、軍備之競爭、以及感情之决裂、當時之種種因素、均足引起普遍戰爭之慘劇、多數國家苟能任其發展、當願和平解决彼等之問題、但彼等統治者必須顧慮其他不能遵守以和平方法改善人種原則之統治者之襲擊、此種國家之人民、盲從希冀專制權力之領袖、希望擴充彼等之領土、矯正過去戰爭之非法、或覓求推銷商貨及容納人民之尾閭、而人民則因迫不及待、轉信武力政策、或惟有彼等始能完成特殊使命之在妄思想、余承認、　　所言、當非任何國家所願樂聞、彼之感想當能獲得希望和平、　　得不採取機詐策略、國家之同情、此實係歐亞兩洲今日邦交之通病、世界人民之願守目前疆界及裁减軍備者共佔百分之九十、其餘百分之十、則强迫其他民族整軍經武、限制海軍之繼續努力、所以終鮮成效者、其故坐此、美國之政策、希望以和平之方法、限制軍備、以道德的力量、解决爭端、反對專制階級之高壓政策云、</p>
<p>總統引證美國中立法稱、戰爭如不能避免、則南美及北美各國維持秩序良好之中立、充份國防力量、並應盡力斡旋使交戰國恢復和平、史實證明專制威脅和平、而崇奉民主政治之國家從無此種危機也、</p>
<p>少數擁有勢力之金融及工業組織反對新政、但政府之革新計畫、至今卒底於成、惟特權階級之代表希望重　政權、彼等借國家之憲法以圖自身之利益、初與保管人及股董以交付彼等保管之財產用作政爭之謬誤思想、並無二致云、</p>
<p>總統復責其政敵壓迫工人股東消費者及建議撤消政府之提案、蓋因彼等自信此項提案反足阻碍復興也、總統繼續抨擊公然主張雇用童工、抑低工資、取締社會安全程序終止農業救濟工賑及取消工人組織權利之敵人稱、吾人豈眞欲取消保障投資之法律而任人民受詭詐投機者之魚肉乎、專制階級並不希望恢復昔日之制度、但願奪取集中之政權耳、如吾人步步退讓、則彼等將誅求無　、而將奪取政權奴視人民焉、專制階級擬利用恐怖思想以遂其願云、</p>
<p>總統引證工商業之進步稱、聯邦預算之得近平衡實由稅收增加所致、但政府並未徵收新稅余、深信無需徵收新稅、復興現有長足之進展、故國家之救濟經費將來當可减少也、總統要求國會前進稱余信諸君今後當不致使人民失望、良以君等今已忠實滿足人民之期望故也、總統之演說由無錢電傳播全國、聆之者當在一千五百萬家以上、（三日國民電)</p>

<p>華盛頓　第七十四屆國會、今日舉行第二次參衆兩院聯席會議、預測該會會期雖短、辯論必甚激烈、參衆兩院外交委員會主席畢德門及麥克雷諾爾於開會後卽共同提議中立案、該案規定　命令式的禁止軍事材料運往交戰國、　准許禁止逾額商品糧食藥品及主要產物之出口、　命令式的禁止買賣交戰國之證券、惟非政府慈善機關發行之證券爲例外、　一遇戰爭狀態存在、卽行實施禁運、惟國會得宣布反對此舉、　總統得發表聲明、美人之與交戰國人民交易者、概須自行負擔危險、麥克雷諾爾於提出該案復稱、彼擬修正該案俾南北美國之發生對外戰爭者、不受該案之束縛、以符門羅主義之精神、兩院漸卽一致通過聆取羅斯福總統今晚發表之常年咨文、遂卽散會、至晚間九時再開、同時擁護巴德門膨脹津貼案之議員五十人舉行會議、决定要求衆院於一月十三日前考慮該案、屆時該案將自動列入衆院議程、巴德門稱委員會開會時擬起草一共同計畫、以備參衆兩院之採納、吾人應終止發行免稅之證券、良以我國有巨額之存金、儘可發行良好之通貨云、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　上年八月底國會所通過之戰時中立法、業由總統公佈施行、共效力至本年二月底爲止、茲國會已於本日複會、衆議院外交委員會主席麥克雷諾爾茲、當向該院提出新中立法案擬將現行法加以修正、俾成爲永遠中立法、其內容主張授權總統、得以便宜行事、擴大禁運物品淸單、舉凡戰爭所必需之原料品、均得禁其運往交戰各國、毫不加以區別、但由美國國會特別予以許可者、不在此例、麥克雷諾爾茲頃宣稱、此案曾與羅斯福總統從長計議、政府已認爲適宜、至拉丁美洲各國興美洲以外各國交戰之時、此項條文、自未便籠統援用、現擬另提修正案、以便保持門羅主義、而預防美洲以外各國之侵略云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>日內瓦　國聯人員及外交家今晨四時前聽無線電傳來美總統之國會演詞、頗為注意、蓋以其言在國聯將來對意制裁上或有重大影饗也、在理論上國聯制裁之如何措施、與美國無關、但在事實上維護國聯者深盼羅總統有以敎之目前此間輿情以爲如羅總統關於交戰國之言論果爲國會所採納、則國聯對意油禁之表决、可更進一步、蓋以美國已植一前例、而美國平時輸往意國之油額雖可照常不予禁阻、然額量不鉅、不足以供意國之需要也、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間官塲對於美國總統羅斯福昨在國會所發表之咨文、雖期待甚殷、但不願表示意見、即對於美國關於交戰國所採取之態度、亦不願加以評論、此在積極主張對意制裁者、則以為羅斯福總統對於侵略與專制國、已發出露骨之警吿、特嫌中立法案、尙有未盡之處耳、若干方面則表示欣幸、蓋因對意禁運煤油問題、歐洲各國已多表示反對者、今有美國總統之一言、自必振振有詞也、要之、熱心主張制裁之徒、茲已大受打槃矣云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>蔣院長元旦在中央廣播電台講演、題目爲「國民自救救國之要道」、原詞如下、全國同胞、今天是我們民國二十五年元旦、我們全體同胞大家歡欣鼓舞同聲慶祝的一天、現在兄弟雖然不能親自和各位見面、但是可以在廣播電台中親自和各位說話、這是很可快慰的一件事情、現在兄弟藉此機會、將我們國家和全體同胞今年最緊要的工作、和各位同胞說一大家都知道、我們國家的情勢、現在很危險急迫、時時刻刻都在危急存亡之中、但是國家民族的命運、完全是由我們全體同胞自己來决定的、我們要挽救四萬萬同胞所共有的中華民國、要復興歷史文化最悠久最光榮的中華民族、我相信、一是在我們中華民國本身的努力、換句話說、就是在我們四萬萬同胞的身上、就是要我們全國國民個個能够努力自强、語云、「天下興亡、匹夫有責」、現在大家旣知國家民族如此危急、無論那一個人、都應該拿這兩句格言策勵自己、明白本分、負起責任、一心一德、羣策羣力、堅定志向、團結精神、共同一致的向救國救民的目標奮勇前進、要曉得我們救國家、也並不是怎麼樣困難的事情、只要大家就本身所能做到的事情、能够自强不息的努力去做、我相信我們國家無論如何急危、在今年一年以內、就可以挽救過來、使能轉危爲安、轉弱爲强、轉禍爲福、我們知道、無論那一個國家、當他要從新建立起來、或是那一個民族、當他要努力復興起來的時候、一定要遭受很多禍害、遇到很大的危險、反轉來說、一個龐大的國家和積弱的民族、如果不遭遇很多的禍害和很大的危險、他决不會眞正覺悟奮發、從而自强復興、所以我們國家民族、現在雖然遭受空前的禍害、遇着莫大的危險、不僅不必悲觀、不必憂慮、而且我們看到外來禍害愈多、當前的危險愈大、就可以斷言、我們國家民族復興的時機愈快、古人說、「無敵國外患者國恒亡」、又說「股憂所以啟聖、多難所以興邦」、者是這個意思、我們中華民族有五千年來最悠久的光榮歷史、有四千萬方里的錦繡河山、更有占世界人口四分一的四萬萬同胞、你看現在世界上那一個國家民族比得上我們的偉大、只要我們全體國民都能堅定民族的自信力、眞正自立自强、還怕什麼、還憂什麼、我們國家一定可以救轉、民族一定可以復興、而且就從今年可以復興、</p>
<p>今後我們應該如何自强自立、或者說今後救亡復興的方法是什麼呢、就是剛才所說的、只要大家將本身所能做到的事情、切切實實做好、就是自强自立、亦卽救亡復興之道、最要緊最基本的一點、就是兩年以來、大家所知道幷且大家都在努力推行的新生活運動、新生活運動的意義、就是要使我們全國同胞、都能恢復我們中華民族固有的道德精神—禮義廉恥、而首先實現於食衣住行等日常生活習慣之中、使我們的國民、個個人隨時隨地都能明禮義知廉恥、不再做一件悖禮違義寡廉鮮恥的事情、而以禮義廉恥來樹立我們自己和整個國家民族的人格、洗刷我們各個人和整個國家民族過去一切的恥辱、我們一個人必須有高尙自立的人格、才有現代國民的資格、不愧爲一個現代的國民、國家也必須有尊榮獨立人格、才有現代國家的資格、不愧爲一個現代的國家、無論個人或國家、只要自己的眞實的人格能够樹立起來、那一個人也不敢來欺侮我們、那一個國家也不敢來侵略我國、否則不僅人家要欺壓我們、侵略我們、而且要滅亡我們、所謂「人必自侮而後人侮之、國必自伐而後人伐之」、這是一定的道理、所以要想人家不欺侮·不壓迫·不侵略我們、惟有大家自己勉勵自己、各人努力樹立現代國民的人格、卽所以共同努力樹立我們國家的人格、而其基本的努力、就是要恢復我們民族固有的道德精神、我們民族的固有道德精神、實爲古今中外一切文明國家的國民所必須具備的基本要件、所以我們全國同胞務必時時刻刻牢記「明禮義、知廉恥」這兩句話、並且身體而力行之、從前所有一切紛亂散漫、苟且偸惰、驕奢淫佚、自私自利、萎靡不振、麻木不仁之腐敗的生活習性、都要一掃而空、剷除凈盡、不好再和從前一樣糊糊塗塗做一個落伍的野蠻時代的人、而要以「昨死今生」的决心、除舊布新、實行「整齊·淸潔·簡樸·勤勞·迅速·確實·」的新生活、做一個「明禮義·知廉恥·」的新國民、我們大家既成為現代的新國民、當然可以建立現代文明強盛的新國家、當然可以和人家並駕齊驅、立於自由平等的地位、（未完）國際商業電訊</p>

<p>開明書局編輯葉紹鈞</p>
<p>諸位同學：這一决的題目是「怎樣寫作」，關於這個題目，現在有好些的書籍，或稱什麽文作法，或稱作文法大要，都講得很詳細。一個人當拿起筆來預備寫作的時候，如果要隨時翻查這些書籍，一一按照書籍裏所說的做去，那就像主婦一手拿着烹飪講義一手做菜一樣，未免是個笑話了。這些書籍大半從現成的文章裹歸納出一些法則來，吿訴人家怎樣怎樣寫作是合乎法則的，當然也附帶說明怎樣怎樣寫作是不合乎法則的。我們有了這些知識，去看一般文章就有了一枝量尺，不但知道某一篇文章好，還說得出某一篇文章好在什麼地方，不但知道某一篇文章不好，還說得出某一篇文章不好在什麼地方。自然，這些知識也能影響到我們的寫作習慣，可是這種影響只在有意無意之問，在某一點上，本來常常不合乎法則的，因爲有了作文法的知識，就覺悟自己的不合法則。於是特地留心，要把他改變過來。這特地留心未必馬上就有成效，或許在三次裏頭，兩次是改變過來了，一次却依然犯了老毛病。必須從特地留心而成爲不待經意的習慣，這才可以每一次都合乎法則。所以作文法一類書籍對於我們的直接的帮助還在增强我們看文章的眼力，而增强我們寫文章的腕力只是對於我們的間接的帮助。我並不是勸諸位不要看這些書籍，只是說看了這些書籍未必就能把文章寫好，如果臨到作文而去翻査這些書籍，那更是毫無實益的傻事。</p>
<p>諸位現在都寫語體文。語體文的最高的境界就是文章同說話一樣。寫在紙上的一句句的文章，念起來就是口頭的一句句語言，敎人家念了聽了，不祖完全明白文章裏的意思，還能够領會到那種聲調和神氣，彷彿當面聽那作文的人親口說話一般。要達到這一個境界，不能專門在文字方面做工夫，最要緊的還在鍜鍊我們的語言習慣。因爲語言，好比物體的本身，文章好比給物體留下一個影像來的照片，物體本身完整而有式樣，拍成的照片當然完整而有式樣，語言周妥而沒有毛病，按照語言寫下來的文章常然也周妥而沒有毛病了。所以鍜鍊語言習慣是尋到根源去的辦法。不過有一句應當聲明，語言習慣是本來要　鍊的。一個人生活在人羣中問，隨時隨地都有開口說話的必要，如果語言習慣上，有種種的缺點，也就是生活技能上有了缺點，那是非常吃虧的。把語言習慣　鍊得良好，至少就有了一種極關重要的生活技能。同時對於作文，這又是一種最可靠的根源。我們怎能不努力鍜鍊呢？</p>
<p>現在小學校裏有說話的科目，又有演講辯論會等的組織，中學校裏，演講會和辯論會也常常舉行。這些都是　鍊語言習慣的。在參加這種集會的時候，我們靜聽開口說話的人的語言，往往有以下的幾種情形。說了半句話，縮住了，另外換一句來說，和剛才的半句話並沒有關係，這是一種。「然而」「然而」一連串，「那末」「那末」一大堆，照例用一個也就够了，只因要延長時間，等待下面的話，才說了許多，這是一種。應當「然而」的地方不「然而」，應常「那末」的地方不「那末」只因這地方似乎須要一個詞兒，可是無可奈何，就隨便拉一個詞兒來凑數，這是一種。有一些話聽去很不順耳，仔細辨辨，原來裏頭有幾個詞兒用得不很妥當，不然就是多用了幾個或者少用了幾個詞兒，這又是一種。這樣說話的人，他平時的語言習慣一定很不良好，而且絕不留心去　鍊，所以在演講會辯論會裏就把自己的弱點表露了出來。若敎他瀉文章，他自然按照自己的語言習慣寫，那就他的文章一定比他的口頭語言還要難使人家明白。因爲他開口說話的時候，有他的面部的表情和身體的姿勢作爲帮助，靠着這些帮助，語言雖然差一點，還可以使人家大體明白。等到寫成文章，面部的表情和身體的姿勢是寫不進去的了，讓人家看見的，只是支離破碎前不搭後的一些文句，豈不敎人家糊塗起來？我爲着職務上的關係，很有機會讀到許多中等學生的文章，其中有非常出色的，也有很不像樣就是所謂不通的。不通兩個字太攏統了，說得具體一點，這兩個字所包含的意義，除了材料不健全不妥當以外，就是前面所說的那幾種毛病，就是語言習慣上的缺點。這些同學在平時如果留心銀鍊語言習慣，寫起文章來就可以减少一部分的不通。再加上經騐方面的洗煉，使寫作村料健全而妥當，那就完全通了。所謂「通」原來不是什麼高不可攀的境界：</p>
<p>鍜鍊語言習慣該怎樣着手呢？這並不困難；可是要有恒心，要隨時隨地當一件事做，正像矯正坐立的姿勢一樣，要隨時隨地坐得正，立得正，才可以養成坐得正，立得正的習慣。我們要限定自己，無論何時不說一句不完整的話，說一句話，一定要表達出一個意思，使人家聽了都能够明白。我們要限定自己，無論何時不把一個不很了解的詞兒硬做用在語言裹，也不把一把不很適當的詞兒勉强凑在語言裏，說一句話，一定要每一個詞兒都很稱職，像熟練的軍官指揮他手下的兵士一樣。我們更要限定自己，無論何時不亂用，一個連詞，不多用或者少用一個助詞，說一句話，一定要在應當「然而」的地方才「然而」，應當「那末」的地方才「那末」，需要「嗎」的地方不缺少「嗎」，不需要「了」的地方不無謂地「了」，這樣鍜鍊好像很淺近，很可笑，但實在是最基本的。家長對於小孩子，小學敎師對於小學生，本來應該從旁督促，敎他們作這樣的鍜鍊。不幸家長和小學敎師並沒有留意到這一層，或者留意到而並沒有收得相常的成效，我們爲完成極關重要的生活技能起見，就只得自己來留意。留意了相當期間之後，要測騐成效怎樣，從極簡短的單句像「我正在看書」「他吃過飯了」這些語言上是看不出來的。我們不妨試說五分鐘連續的話，看這一番話裹能不能每句依照着我們自己限定的條件。如果能够了，那就我們的鍜鍊已經收了成效。到這地步，作起文來就不覺得費事了，口頭該怎麼說的筆下就該怎麼寫，把無形的語言寫下來成爲有形的文章，只要楚會寫字的人，誰又不會做呢？而文字上的不通也就不會發生了，因爲所依據的原是全沒毛病的語言，</p>
<p>聽人家的語言讀人家的文章，對於鍛練語言習慣也有帮助，聽人家語言的時候；如果不特地留意，那末了解了人家的意思就算數，對於鍜鍊我們的語言習惯不會有直接的帮助，必須特地留意，人家怎樣選用詞兒，人家怎樣表達出一個意思，人家怎樣把一篇長長的語言順次地說下去。這樣之後，那檢察所得的都是我們有用的資料，人家的長處我們可以摹仿，人家的短處我們可以避免。再說讀人家的文章。這裏有一點必須注意，就是現在的文章，那怕是有名的文章家寫的，都還不純粹是口頭的語言。寫語體文只是十幾年來的事，大家的技術還沒有練到怎樣純熟的地步，同時語體文的語彙也沒有經過公同的選定。大家爲省事起見，往往湊進一些文言的調子和語彙去，成爲一種不尶不尬的文體。但是我們剛才曾經說過，語體文的最高的境界就是文章同說話一樣。所以這種不尷不尬的文體只能認爲過渡時期的當然產物，不能認爲十分完善了的標準範本？這一點認識淸楚了，才可以不受現在文章的壞影饗，而用批判的眼光讀去。但有長處，當然摹仿，其不很純粹的短處，就努力避免。如果全國中等學生都向這方而用工夫，不但自己的語言習慣可以鍜鍊得非常良好，還可以把語體文的文體加速地推進到極端純粹的境界裏去呢？（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c148">肺病治愈之原理及『荷爾蒙』療法 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>肺結核之治愈　在生理的防禦機能之旺盛　欲達肺結核之治愈，當先明白肺結核之病竈，究竟以若何自然的作用，而使之治愈，此實重耍之問題，病家不可不探究也。據學理上所見，結核菌入犯肺中，繫殖發育，產生毒質，肺組織中卽起病變，生一點透明之物，久之卽變黃色，大如小米，再久之卽漸漸擴大，變成硬塊（此卽病　）；此時人體中組織細胞，卽出其自然之能力。全力以禦之；包圍防堵，務使病變止絕，此卽有生物體中之生理的防禦機能，要而言之，卽自然之療能也。此防禦機能之消長，卽身體與病菌戰爭勝敗之所由分也。若防禦力旺盛，則病灶周圍，增生一極堅固之質—名曰結締織，編成堡壘，禁錮病灶，使病變之作用，完全失其活動，終必使之完全停止，以至治愈。若防禦力不足，則自然之療能减退，其肉體遂為病菌所戰勝，於是，病卽活動不巳，症候日漸增惡，以至不治，由此以觀，肺病能吾治愈，須視生理的防禦力之强弱以為斷。固無疑義</p>
<p>不論動植物皆有此生理的防禦機能　蓋不問動物或植物，凡生物均有此種自然之療能—卽生理的防禦機能，例如試折斷植物之技，卽在該處再行生芽；損傷動物之皮膚，卽在該處作成疤痕而愈，此皆為自然之療能，諒世人亦所熟知者也。</p>
<p>病魔糾纏於身體者　防禦機能必定薄弱　欲使肺結核之病灶速就治愈，須有旺盛之生理的防禦機能—及有充足之自然的療能，方可達到此治愈之目的。然若患有結核之人，因病變久纏於身體，則此等機能，往往發生阻害，甚至不能發展者有之，此時不得不注意於治療；如上文所述，故其治療之目的，亦惟利用其自然之妙機，而以人力之補助—旺盛其生理的防禦機能—促進其恢復自然治愈之現象及機轉，舍人體自然之療能而外，他無確實可靠之療法。吾人欲講求恢復此自然療能，當先探究其機能衰退之原因；所謂補助方法者，無論任何藥劑之使用，皆不能奏效。據英國大生理學家史丹林STARKUBG說；生理的防禦機能薄弱之原因，實由於體內一內分泌」不足之故；俗云：「油盡燈滅」，卽同此理也。欲燈光復明—必先加油；欲恢復吾人之生理機能—則當補給其「內分泌」，此毫無疑義者也。故今日最確實有根據之肺病的根本治療，祗有採用內分泌物『荷爾蒙』的自然補助療法，方為合理而有效。</p>
<p>內分泌物「荷爾蒙」之作用　於身體康健上有極大之關係　荷爾蒙療法，又名臟器療法ORGANOTHERAPTE荷爾蒙HOR—MONE者，為動物體內之內分泌腺所產出之一種內分泌物質；荷爾蒙之作用，為促進身神之發育，調節物質新陳代謝之要素；且營破壞有害於身體之物質，能使之變為無害；故荷爾蒙於身體健康上之關係甚屬重要，如有過度或不足，皆足以發生疾病也。</p>
<p>「荷爾蒙」療法　中外民間早已有之　臟器治療疾病，古代即已有之；　如紀元前四六〇—三七七年時，古印度人對於患頭痛者，卽用鳥類之腦煮而食之；有肝胃病者，用猪羊之肝胃食之；於咳嗽氣急者，則用牛馬猪羊之肺臟食之；男子生殖器衰弱者，則用牛馬之睪丸食之；卽於我國舊醫或民間，亦常有用動物之臟器或人類之血液及排泄物等，以為治療疾病之用者。蓋自古以來，不問中外，卽已暗暗有施用「荷爾蒙」療法之思想矣。</p>
<p>吾人當身體之何種臟器內分泌减退—或何種「荷爾蒙」减少，而致疾病時，應用其他動物之含有同一「賀爾蒙」之臟器，或其製劑，注射或內服後，以補該「賀爾蒙」之缺乏，而達對症的治療之目的，卽謂之「賀爾蒙」療法，或曰「內分泌」療法是也古時之食用臟器以療疾病，法雖極粗笨，時亦奏效；現在醫藥進步，日新月異，分門別科，詳細研究，而古代簡陋之臟器療法，經近代生物學家之試騐，化學上之研究，一躍而為最新式最王道之新療法矣。</p>
<p>肺結核以「荷爾蒙」療法　最為合理　且確實有效　肺癆病人肺臟之實質發生結核病　，致使內分泌之機能衰退—「荷爾蒙」之產生減少，故物質之新陳代謝發生障碍，而影響及於生理的防禦機能之薄弱—自然的療能之衰退，因此病　卽漸擴大，症候日趨險惡，由初期進至二期，再由二期進至末期，如此遷延，遂至不治。故治療肺癆之惟一方法，旣全在乎旺盛其生理的防禦機能，則着手醫治之道，自宜依循此等自然治愈之動作，採用含有同一「荷爾蒙」之肺臟製劑，以內服或注射方法，傚法而增益之？最為確切而有效。此種肺臟荷爾蒙製劑，名曰「肺活」Phith　Weal　用於肺病之治療，可十分發展其生理的防禦機能—旺盛其自然療能，故作用之偉大神妙，其治療肺癆之功效，實可驚異也。</p>
<h3 id="c149">最新荷爾蒙製劑 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>『肺活』Phith　Weal之成分及功用談</p>
<p>茲據多數學者之實騐與報吿。治療肺結核之惟一方法。全在乎旺盛其生理的防禦機能。最為適合。此防禦機能之消長。即身體與病菌戰爭勝敗之所由分也。蓋人身之防禦力旺盛。則病竈周圍。增生一極堅固之結締織。包裹病竈。使病變之作用。完全失共活動。終必使之完全停止。以至治愈。</p>
<p>故欲使病竈速就治愈。不得不講求適當之方法。以補助促進其自然療能。使之旺盛。此種方法。即為本症患者之日常生活。應竭力使達良好之衛生狀態。而其根本則在實踐衛生榮養療法是也。</p>
<p>治療肺癆之目的。端在乎旺盛其生理的防禦機能。已如上述。然病變已久困吾人之身體。則此等機能。往往發生阻害。馴致不能發展者有之。此時則不得不藉人力以補助之。</p>
<p>肺結核治療上。至今尙無特效藥發明。可直接撲滅結核菌之藥品。絕未有之。且各種藥物。往往徒加無謂刺戟於病竈。反有碍乎組織之防禦機能。故用藥物治療肺結核。確為害多而益少也。</p>
<h3 id="c150">肺活主要成分賀爾蒙之鐵證 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>甲圖為肺臟賀爾蒙十字形結晶　本圖用顯微鏡擴大六百倍攝影　乙圖為脾臟賀爾蒙十字形結晶</p>
<p>此種賀爾蒙係由强健動物新鮮肺與脾兩臟器中提出者</p>
<p>自臟器療法勃興後。學者對於肺結核之治療。亦另闢新的途徑。採用荷爾蒙療法。經多數之實騐。而證明其效果。亦不外乎旺盛其生理的防禦機能。得增進治愈之境。故荷爾蒙療法。於肺結核尙稱合理有效也。</p>
<p>「肺活」Phith　Weal即哺乳動物新鮮肺臟與脾臟中抽出之有效成分（荷爾蒙）所製。用以治療肺結核之專劑也。茲將本品內服液中所含之成分及功用。述之於後。</p>
<p>第一成分為肺臟「荷爾蒙」Hormon　of　Pulmon—ary（附刊甲圖）係由壯健之哺乳動物新鮮肺臟中提出者，每瓶有肺臟荷爾蒙二十西西每西西有等於新鮮肺臟一百克，故質地濃厚，效力充足，據各國肺病療養院之臨床實騐報吿，結核息者於服食『肺活』Phith　Weal以後，其有效成分，（即肺臟荷爾蒙）立被吸收，循環於身體內各器官，其中允以對肺部呈直接動作，能振起其已衰退之機能，調節新陳代謝，恢復生理的防禦機能旺盛，催進自然療能之振興，如組織缺損者得以塡補之，同時在病竈之周圍，築成鞏固結締織之牆壁，使之硬化，催促疤痕之形成，完全包裹惡魔之結核菌，失其活動，終必使之完全消滅，以至全愈。肺臟荷爾蒙對於凝血之作用，甚為强大，倘患者當有頑固之咯血，服用『肺活』Phith　Weal以後，即可發生防止作用，永無復現之憂。肺臟荷爾蒙能中和體內結核菌分泌之毒素，且有抑制作用，故服用「肺活」Phith　Weal治療以後，如發熱，咳嗽，盜汗等症候，皆逐漸自然消失。</p>
<p>第二成分為脾臟荷爾蒙HORMONE　OF　SPL—EEN（附刋乙圖）係由壯健動物之新鮮牌　中提出者。每瓶中含脾臟荷爾蒙二十西西，每西西等於新鮮脾臟一百瓦。其功用可增加患者體內已經減少之紅血球數。與血色素海克洛平HaeMcglcbin之含量。幷能促進白血球淋巴球與洋紅色　血球Easino　Philen之長育。脾臟荷爾蒙。又能限制血液中燐酸鹽Phopliat之排泄。與增進血液中之鈣質成分。同時更能使病寵中已衰退之組織。恢復其旺盛之機能。而促進免疫物質之產生。漸次增加身體之防禦力。脾臟荷爾蒙於全身之新陳代謝。特別對於類脂體Lipoid及鐵之代謝機能有重要關係。更有能促進病竈之結締組織增殖。包圍結核。而使硬化。以至治愈。脾臟荷爾蒙。幷有凝血作用。防止咯血。亦甚顯著。</p>
<p>『肺活』Phith　Weal曾經施用動物之嚴密試騐，及應用於人體之治療實騐。對於肺病確有驚人之偉效，但毫無副作用及任何流弊，與有猛烈作用—有害於人體之化學藥劑療法，誠不可以道里計也。</p>
<p>『肺活』Phith　Weal之治療範圍，不論一二三期肺癆，咳嗽，咯血，血痰，喘息，氣急，急慢性氣管支炎，均有特效，不拘老幼，皆可服用，倘身體虛弱—有感染肺癆之素質者，服用『肺活』Phith　Weal可根本改造體格，促進內分泌產生機能，而使營養狀態佳良，肺强力壯，能預防肺癆之發生，故為『有癆者治癆—無癆者增進康健預防肺癆』</p>
<p>由此觀之，肺病之治療，根據近世治愈肺癆之原理，及臨床醫家之實騐報吿，『肺活』Phith　Weal確為最合理且有根據之荷爾蒙製劑也。况乎我國今日無完全之肺病療養院，人民又貧乏，有入院療養能力者，百無一人，故於家庭療養，益不能不乞靈藥，謀所以補救之道，肺活』Phith　Weal之內服療法，正大可施行也</p>
<h3 id="c151">咯血之預防 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃</p>
<p>咯血之來源。約有兩種。一為氣管支點膜損傷時之出血。一為肺結核空洞內血管破裂之出血。前者，在咳嗽劇烈時。如重症氣管支炎，百日咳等常見之。後者為眞正肺癆的咯血。但肺吸虫病，肺膿瘍（即肺　）氣管支擴張，肺梅毒等病。亦有現咯血症狀者。</p>
<p>肺結核之空洞。大小種種不同。極小空洞內之微細血管破裂時。起小咯血。如咳痰中之血點或血絲等是。大空洞內之比較大的血管破裂時。則起大咯血。</p>
<p>凡空洞，多與氣管支交通。故止血較為困難。因空洞中破裂血管之游離端。無壓迫止血之機會故耳。</p>
<p>咯血雖多。但直接以咯血致死的甚少。而血液之凝塊。閉塞氣管支內。因此窒息而死的。則常見之。</p>
<p>咯血之原因。為血管受結核性的變化。以致破裂。而以精神感動，或身體過癆及咳嗽等為誘因。</p>
<p>咯血之預防。起病時之咯血雖無法可以預防。若有劇烈之咳嗽。則常設法除去為要。病程中咯血者。常因用力過甚。以致血管破裂。故預防之法。即無論何種動作。應時時留心。萬不可用力過度。凡已得醫師診斷為初期肺病者。即須從事修養。嚴守攝生方法。</p>
<p>近時用於防止咯血之藥品。以臟器製劑之效力甚大。如肺臟與脾臟中提出之荷爾蒙所製者。以『肺活』Phith　Weal之功效允著。倘有頑固咯血。痰中時常發見血點或血絲者。除嚴守攝生外。服用『肺活』Phith　Weal可達痊愈。</p>

<p>民國二十五年的新年已來了，你們逢到這大好的新年，有吃，有玩，應該是多麼的快樂！並且學校裏放了假，任你們自由自在，要怎樣，就怎樣，你們是樂園中的小天使，眞使人何等羨艷啊！</p>
<p>不過：現在我們的國家，正是內憂外患，國難重重！要挽救危亡，要復興民族，要雪恥圖强，雖說都是成人的責任，但諸位小朋友，皆是未來的主人翁，那末也可說有一，部分的責任，更要請你們從今年起，立一個救國的新志願，雖則在快樂的新年中，也時時不可忘了國難！對於各種學問，尤其要細心研究，靜聽師長的敎誨，遵循父兄的指導，有勇敢心，有堅毅心，有勤奮心，不懈惰，不說謊，不迷信，這些都是做主人翁的初步準備，將來才可以為社會服務，為國家効勞，區區微意，還望我們親愛的小朋友採納了吧！</p>

<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>今年是鼠年，和小朋友談談鼠：壞人呌做「鼠輩，」小朋友立志，要做有益於社會和有益於國家的人，凡一切「鼠竊」的行為，都要力圖避免的：免得人家把你當作那最可厭惡的老鼠一樣看待。</p>
<p>膽量小的人，呌做「膽小如鼠，」人無膽量，遇到應當做的事情，就不能見義勇為，便稱為沒用的懦夫了。阿國以一小弱國，與强意對抗，相持如許之久，不是有膽量，能做得到嗎？這就是目前一個比例：但膽大也不能妄為，所以成語又云：「膽欲大而心欲細。」</p>
<p>沒有决心的人，呌做「首鼠兩端，」這種心理，是往往把良好的機會錯過，無法挽回。譬如小朋友，當此黃金時代，不肯决心去努力用功，一年一年的沒有長進，那末，少小不努力，老大徒傷悲，將來就後悔無及了：當此新年開始，是要下一番决心的。</p>
<p>一種由鼠體寄生的蚤傳染的黑死病，呌做「鼠疫，」若是發現這種病，蔓延極速，死亡很多，可是小朋友，如若見到人家有不好的行為，跟着倣效，等到沾染了惡習，與之同化，眞所謂「近墨者黑」，和那傳染着黑死病的鼠疫，同樣的危險，小則弄到身敗名裂，說到極端，生命都有妨害，所以遇到人家壞事，不能盲從。</p>
<p>鼠雖微物，有種人拿牠在馬路上做戲，呌做「鼠戲，」鼠受訓練，還能做戲博錢，小朋友讀書，假若無一技之長，這不是「人不如鼠」麽？鼠年鼠年！該怎麽的圖上進呢？</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>元旦，珊姑娘起牀很早，太陽打窗子外射進來，把半桌上的那盆水仙花照得格外靑翠而挺秀，天竹的小果現得更鮮紅奪目，百靈鳥在屋簷下呌的比平日宛轉動聽，眼前似乎換了一番新的氣象，新的活躍。</p>
<p>珊姑娘多麽快活呵，換了新的湖綠衣服，又呌姐姐在鬢脚邊　了支海棠，沒抹粉和胭脂，伊本來就有了健康的蘋果色的臉龐。伊來來去去很忙，小花貓亦老跟在伊脚邊奔跑，帮着忙碌似的。原來珊姑娘早定在元旦日招待幾個小朋友吃飯。菜由伊姐姐預備，糖果盤，佈置，伊自己動手。</p>
<p>第一個來賓是李順福，穿着洗掙的奮竹布罩衫，他是成衣匠的兒子，家裏窮苦，可是珊姑娘向來待伊很好，因為他愛淸潔，守紀律，有禮貌。此刻見了面，相對彎彎腰，珊姑娘引他在特地佈置的客室中坐。天花板下滿牽着鮮明的國旗和紙練，壁上貼着珊姑娘的手工和蠟筆畫。長方桌上有三瓶鮮花。</p>
<p>一回兒，汪大保來了，黃麗芬來了，朱阿貴，陳曼曼，張仁林……也都來了，大家圍坐着吃糖菓，講除夕各人在家中的經過。珊姑娘當下領導全體小朋友唱中華民國國歌，並請伊姐姐扔風琴，接着又上樓把媽媽請下來，介紹給來賓們，全體來賓站起恭恭敬敬一鞠躬。又坐下，靜聽演講：</p>
<p>「元旦本是孩子們的節日，今天你們能相親相愛的聚在一塊，我見了很歡喜，望你們永遠這樣的親愛着，到成了大人還是很和好，你們應當不分貧富，不分貴賤，大家互相帮助，互相動奮勉勵，不學習下流，不懶惰，做個好孩子，將來年紀大了，做個健全的好國民，愛同胞，愛國家，愛世界上和平的人類。今天你們可以儘量的快樂一番，但在快樂中，別忘却還有許多受飢挨凍的孩子！」珊姑娘的媽演說完，接着是吃飯。大家都很守秩序。</p>
<p>屋子裏充溢着新的氣象，新的活躍。國旗顯得格外的燦爛光輝。</p>

<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>上海縣閔行民衆敎育館，為鼓勵兒童運動的興趣，和引起社會人士注意兒童生活起見，特在本年元旦日，舉行兒童運動會。這天，記者也曾去觀光了一次，雖然天氣是不大好，然而，參加的兒童，却仍有八十餘人之多，這不能不說是一種良好的成續了！</p>
<p>這次兒童運動會，分甲乙兩組，甲組有踢毽子，跳繩，射箭，投籃，滾鐵環，障碍競走，汽槍打靶等七種。乙組有踢毽子，射箭，滾鐵環等四種。有的必須在運動塲上舉行的，有的可以在該館大禮堂上舉行的，這一决，因為天上的毛毛雨，時降時止，所以興趣方面，當然是受到相當的影響。然而，兒童的精神，却仍然非常熱烈，所以該館為了適應環境的需要，一部份可以在室內舉行的運動，便改在室內舉行，如競走，汽槍打靶，射箭，投籃等等，那是要在天晴的時候補行的了！</p>
<p>這决兒童運動會的用品，都由該館供給，同時，還酌備了不少的獎品，如書籍文具，毛巾，牙刷，牙粉，手帕，玩具，食品之類，預備分別獎贈給成績優良的兒童，這種提倡兒童運動的精神，眞是可以佩服的。</p>
<p>兒童的幸福，現在已經普遍的在給成人們注意起來了！我還希望各地民敎機關，在可能範圍之內，多多的提倡，多多的獎勵。</p>

<p>葡萄牙的女人　　葡萄牙的男人</p>
<p>一個破落戶　葡萄牙，也像我們中國一樣，從前是一個强大的國家，可是現在國勢遠不如從前了。它冷淸淸地住在歐羅巴洲的西面一隻角落裏，國土小，人民少，國內年年發生革命和暴動，民生困難，國債山積，雖然還有廣大的屬地，但是國基飄搖不定，好比一個富豪人家，後來敗落，架子雖大，內容空虛，免不了被鄰居笑為「破落戶。」</p>
<p>圖案式國旗　葡萄牙的國旗是：分全面為紅綠，兩色，綠在左，紅在右，綠比紅來得狹。當中有一個黃色圓形的圖案。（二）</p>
<p>地形像布帆　葡萄牙位於歐羅巴洲的西南端，東北兩面和西班牙相接，西南兩面臨着大西洋，非洲西北端的亞速爾和馬德拉兩羣島，也是它的直屬的領土。地形狹長，頗像帆船上扯起了的布帆。（一）</p>
<p>肺病療養所　葡萄牙首都里司本，在國境西段風景秀麗，氣候很好，各國生肺病的人多住在這兒養病。（四）</p>
<p>葡萄園很多　葡萄牙是一個農業國家。葡萄園佔全國土地百分之三十五。他們更有一種著名的物產，就是軟木塞子。這些軟木塞子是用軟木樹的皮製成的。樹皮剝去了一層之後，在八九年之內，又會生出一層新皮。全世界所用的軟木塞子，葡萄牙和西班牙兩國所產的要佔百分之七十呢。（三）</p>
<p>男人和女人　葡萄牙人的性情很輕佻，講愛虛榮，歡喜享樂，不求上進。敎育還沒有普及，下等社會裏，沒有知識的人很多。我們看了（圖五）和（圖六），可以知道他們的服裝是怎樣的。</p>

<h3 id="c221">賴伐爾內閣的壽命 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 守和</p>
<p>由於經濟恐慌的發展，財政危機的加深，近年來法國政治的動盪情形可以說比任何國家都要嚴重。過去法國的內閣大都是在幾個月之內就告崩潰，其中甚至還有在上台後三兩天內就壽終正寢的，單就這種情形看來，也可想見近年來法國政局是如何的不安了。在這樣政局不安的情况下，便促進了法國左右兩極端政治思想的發展和這兩者間鬭爭的尖銳。事實上法國右翼的組織，如由退伍參戰軍人所組成的火十字會已有了三十餘萬的人數，愛國靑年團亦擁有三十二萬五千多的團員，此外如法蘭西行動黨等亦有很多的黨員。同時，在另一方面，法國左翼各黨，如急進社會黨，社會黨和共產黨等也有很大的力量。因之在巴黎等地幾乎隨時都可見到左右兩極端的正面衝突表現；而且，右翼各派已組成了聯合的組織，一致行動，左翼各黨也聯合了起來，共同結成了一個「人民戰綫」，以與右翼聯合會對抗。這樣，所謂民主政治的最後堡壘法蘭西也就日益表現出難於維持這民主政治的壽命了。</p>
<p>賴伐爾內閣可說是在法國左右兩極端的爭鬭中出現而且被保存着的：但是，由於這兩極端爭鬭之發展，賴伐爾內閣的壽命同時也日益陷於危險的境地中了。在去年的最後兩三月中，賴伐爾內閣就迭决遇到難關，幾度發生危險，牠還能維持到現在，眞可說是僥倖已極。現在，賴伐爾內閣雖然渡過了幾重難關，但據一般觀察，其地位仍未穩固，是否能延長其壽命至一月以後還是很大的問題。我們為了要考察今後賴伐爾內閣的命運，常然有回顧一下他最近的遭遇之必要。</p>
<p>在去年十一月間，法國即因財政們題和取締右翼集團之武裝組織的問題（即共和制度保護問題）發生了政湖。當這兩個問題在衆議院提出時，左翼各黨即要求先討論後者，政府則主張先討論前者，因之發生衝突，相持不下，結果是因急進社會黨的許多上層領袖如赫理歐等支持賴伐爾政府，衆院多數贊成首先討論財政問題，並使政府的財政計畫在衆院通過，使賴伐爾內閣得以渡過第一重難關。至於急進社會黨一部分上層領袖之所以要在這問題中支持賴伐爾內閣者，據赫理歐所作的說明是：「現內閣如果傾覆，則有三種可能之解决辦法：其一即組織「人民陣綫政府」，勢須解散衆議院：其二即急進黨單獨組閣，但在目前情形之下，本黨中無人敢於單獨負責；其三即組織與現內閣相同之新閣，又何必多此一舉？」換言之，急進社會黨的一部分上層領袖是因為在目前情形下對於極左和極右都發生恐怖，在動搖不定和沒有辦法中只有暫時支持賴伐爾內閣了。此後賴伐爾內閣之能一再脫險，都是全靠赫理歐等的救援。</p>
<p>渡過了第一重難關之後，賴伐爾內閣所遇到的第二重難關是取締右翼集團的武裝組織問題。這個問題比財政問題還要嚴重，因為這乃是左右兩面在第一道防綫上决定勝負的問題。對於取締右翼軍事組織一事，不僅為極端左翼所力爭，而且為中問的急進社會黨中之最大多數所要求：同時，右翼各集團也不願意讓步，處在巴黎等大有將要發生嚴重騷擾之勢。因此賴伐爾覺得問題的解决甚為辣手，一再延　問題的討論時間，以圖找尋機會，使自己從危險中走出來。果然，在衆院辯論此問題時，社會黨領袖白倫與火十字會領袖巴爾尼加萊咸稱願解散本黨中的「防衛組織」，於是賴伐爾即乘機提出「禁止在黨中置武裝隊伍」的議案，結果是通過了法案三件：　內長得將危及政制安全之軍事團體通過國務會議後加以解散；　凡非法</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>置有武器者從嚴懲處：　凡在報端發表激烈言論，旨在敎唆殺人者，即使未能發生效果，其負責人得提交法院懲處。因此賴伐爾內閣又渡過了第二重難關。依據眾院所通過的法案，賴伐爾是可同時取締左右兩方面的武裝組織的，所以他之渡過第二重難關正是他的狡詐表現。</p>
<p>然而，渡過一重肉重的難關之後的賴伐爾內閣却並未穏固。接着來的是眾院討論外交問題；這問題是由解决意阿戰爭的英法和平方案所引起來的。當英法和平方案提出後，全世界不公平的方案，對於這個方案無論在巴黎，倫敦，日內瓦與世界各小國中都充滿了反對的空氣，致使英法支配下的國聯也不得不對這方案表示謝絕，並使英外相霍爾下台；在法國也發生同樣嚴重的反響，在這反響中，首先是逼迫支持賴伐爾內閣的不管部閣員赫理歐辭去了急進社會黨的黨魁職務，跟着就是眾院左翼各黨反對政府外交，使賴伐爾內閣的命運非常危險。但結果亦因急進社會黨的一部　分上詹領袖不願掀起閣潮，而决定擁護政府，經過賴伐爾的「舌戰羣儒」之後，內閣又獲勝利。</p>
<p>由上述的事實看來，我們可以見到賴伐爾內閣的壽命是全靠急進社會黨一部分上唇領袖維持的。自然，社會黨領袖白倫等之動搖妥恊也可說是賴伐爾內閣存在的支柱，但主要的，如果不是由於赫理歐等的極力支持，那牠是早已崩潰了。我們知道，急進社會黨是法國最大的政黨，在國會中佔有舉足輕重的地位，雖然它已加入了「人民戰綫」，但它的某些領袖如赫理歐等畏懼極左比較畏懼極右還要厲害，所以他們不得不暫時支持較為「溫和」一點的賴伐爾內閣。今後賴伐爾內閣的壽命究竟能延長到幾時，不消說是要由急進社會黨支持牠的力量來决定了。</p>
<p>目前法國急進社會黨的政見並非統一的，其中有些是日益接近右翼，有些則是逐漸走向左邊來。如果左右兩極端的衝突在法國繼續發展，那急進社會黨的內部必要發生嚴重的分化。事實上，就在過去國會的爭論中，急進社會黨的議員的投票就很不一致。倘若事件發展到了絕對不容許中立搖擺者存在時，那赫理歐等就是要想支持賴伐爾內閣也是無能為力的。</p>
<p>就目前情形看來，賴伐爾是在日益向右邊走去，企圖在右翼和搖擺不定者的維護下以延長其壽命。但由於法郎問題的無法解决，金融困難的不能克服，左右兩極端爭　的不可調和，賴伐爾內閣的壽命實是世界上任何保險公司也不敢保險的。</p>
<p>假使賴伐爾內閣崩潰，更假使在法國出現了左或右的極端政治，其結果對於國際局勢之變化，都是有决定作用的。</p>

<h3 id="c222">文學與戰爭 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 旭晴</p>
<p>戰爭，這是人類生活上的非常的變動。由於戰爭的發生，社會的一切均衡，秩序都要遭到極大的破壞，許多人羣的平常的生活也不能繼續保存，因而一切社會文化也就不能繼續採取漸變的法則，常態地連續發展下去了。文學也是一樣，在戰爭發生的地方必要發生極大的變動；事實上，在機關傖的不斷響聲之下，在大砲的轟擊之下，在被砲彈燬壞了家庭，財產和身體折人們的哀號之下，在勝利者的凱歌和失敗者的悲鳴的交響之下，任何鎭靜的文學作家，任何「超現實」的詩人，也不能不對戰爭表示態度，也不能不描寫他所接近的人羣在戰爭中所發生的思想和感情。</p>
<p>當一九一四到一九一八年的世界大戰發生時，無論德國和法國以及英國，全歐洲乃至全世界的文學都受着戰爭的影響，一般文學作家都從其各目的立塲創作與戰爭有關的作品，許多文學研究者把近代文學分成了戰前的和戰後的兩在階叚：這乃是已成的很明顯的事實。現在世界形勢已緊張到萬分，　處都佈滿了　　氣味，誰也說不一定戰爭將在明天或後天爆發，因而世界文學和一般文化之將發生的變動，也是絕對可以預料的。我們為了要預測在未來的大戰中文學的發展變化形態，為了要指出在那時文學應走的道路，認為有說明文學與戰爭這問題的必要；特別是對於最接近我們的上次世界大戰與文學的事情，尤須加以研究。我們所以要寫這篇文章的理由就在這裏。</p>
<p>戰爭雖然對於每一個作家的創作都有很大的作用，但因為各個作家的生活和世界觀不同，所以他們對於戰爭的感應便不一樣。譬如，在上次世界大戰中，世界各國的作家，有的是由愛國主義的立塲去鼓勵戰爭，有的是在戰爭中高唱人道主義或保守主義之歌，有的是以描寫戰爭中人們的苦悶為自己的任務，有的是從極端個人主義的立塲去反對戰爭和否定一切，有的則是實際地描寫戰爭的實情，或是更進而從社會進化的立塲去反對戰爭。這樣，五花八門，應有盡有，眞可說是「萬花撩亂」了。現在，為了要更加明白問題，我們還可將上次世界大戰中幾種主要的文學傾向略加論究。</p>
<p>首先値得我們注意的是愛國主義的戰爭文學。據統計，在大戰發生的第一年，單是德國的愛國主義的詩歌作品就有百五十萬種之多；霍普物曼和兌梅爾與瓦沙爾曼等九十三名藝術家及思想家所署名的「我們為什麽不能不戰？」的宣言，更是世界共知的為戰爭思想為軍國主義辯護的表現。此外，如英法等國，在戰爭初期，所謂愛國的戰爭文學也是很盛行的，雖然遠不及德國那樣的狂熱。事實上，如蕭伯納的戰爭諷刺劇在當時英國的被禁上演，羅曼羅蘭之因反對戰爭不容於法國的愛國主義者而被驅逐出國，這兩件事情的反方面的意義便是當時英法的愛國主義思潮之高漲；因為假使當時英法不是正熱中於愛國主義，蕭伯納和羅曼羅蘭便不會遭受那樣的待遇了。</p>
<p>其次是在戰爭中發生的保守主義和人道主義的傾向。如美國白璧德和莫爾等所代表的人文主義便是一種保守主義。他們也「反對」戰爭，白璧德本人且曾特別抗議霍普特曼等為戰爭辯護的宣言，但他們認為戰爭發生的原因是由於盧梭的自由主義與培根的科學思想過於發展，所以他們的反對戰爭是反對物質文明，「打倒科學專制」，而要把東方的「中庸主義」復活起來，以安定世界。這種「反戰」的傾向並不是在把世界向前推動，而是企圖把世界還原到十六七世紀乃至中世紀去；在現實的意義上則是用以保存現實世界的保守主義。至於人道主義的文學，因為戰爭已將世界造成了一幅殘酷的畫圖，所以這在戰爭的發展過程中是更為流行，如俄國庫布林的「聖女之花園」，瑞典列加洛夫的「被摒棄者」，乃至於德國的霍普特曼的某些作品，都可說是人道主義的，西班牙伊本納茲的「啟示錄四騎士」和「地中海」也是哀傷的穿着人道主義的彩衣的文學作品。在他的作品中有這樣一段頗為中聽的話：「旣然生了，誰也有生之權利。個人的富者，貧者，强者，弱者，國民之大者，小者，年老者，年少者，誰也有生之權利。我們生之目的並不是為他日其他的人來殺我們，亦不是相互殘殺，相互戰　，終於自己殺了自己。……」這便是頗能使人感動的人道主義的說辭。</p>
<p>此外，在戰爭中和戰爭結束之後，世界上還有表現了知識份子的絕望的文學作品，還有描寫戰爭的恐怖和澈底反對戰爭的小說和戲劇，還有高呼「戰爭萬歲」的未來主義和對一切都「吐之以口唾」的大大主義出現，……因為篇幅關係，我們不能一一在這裏細舉。不過其中如雷馬克的「西綫無戰事」之描寫戰爭的恐怖，蕭伯納與拉科和羅曼羅蘭以及巴比塞的反戰的作品，乃是在目前世界文學中影響最大的，而且是對於戰爭文學開闢了新的道路的，所以他們的作品値得研究現代世界文學者或研究戰爭文學者特別去熟讀。在那中間（如在「西綫無戰事「，在拉科的「戰爭的人們」和巴比塞的「砲火」中）你可以看到戰爭的殘酷的眞實的圖畫，也可以想到如何消滅戰爭，走向光明之路。自然，就在他們的戰爭文學中也有許多缺點，如蕭伯納的「殺偏風」，拉科的絕對的「和平主義」，羅曼羅蘭的人道主義的傾向，都可說是有些不正確的。但我們在研究現代文學時，特別是在研究戰爭文學時，他們仍不失為値得特別注意的對象。</p>
<p>以上算是上次大戰與世界文學這問題的一個簡略叙述。現在，二次世界大戰又成為了現實的問題，我們雖不能說歷史將會完全重演，雖不能說在新的戰爭發生時世界文學所起的變動將會和上次大戰中文學所起的變動一樣，但我們知道人類的模仿性最强，生活於現實中的人如在過去歷史上發現了有利於他的事情，必要如法庖製，把那事情復活起來。因此，我們不難想到，在新的戰爭發生時，為戰爭辯護的愛國文學，因戰爭而根本反對物質文明的保守主義，對戰爭哭泣哀號的人道主義，都有重新以新的姿態出現的可能。而且，事實上，現在就有一些御用的知識份子在那里鼓吹和帮助侵略的戰爭，很顯然的例證是無綫電發明者馬可尼的努力於侵阿的工作，把戰爭當作「最好的衛生學」的未來派還在熱烈歡迎戰神的來臨；一旦世界大戰廣泛地爆發起來，那這些御用的知識份子更不知道還要如何在戰神之前狂舞呢！</p>
<p>假使文學並非消遣品，假使它還有點作用時，那這作用就當時為人類社會謀福利。戰爭是殘酷的，是破壞人類生活，毀滅人類生命的，文學如在戰爭中和戰爭前後必然要發生大的變化，那好的文學為了人類的幸福便當反對戰爭，反對那為戰爭辯護的文學。但這反對並不是要連一切物質文明都根本推翻，要人回復到中世紀去，那是保守的，甚至是開倒車的；這反對應該是站在進步的立塲，積極地消滅產生戰爭的社會因素，使物質文明得到更高度的發展，使人類更加幸福。同時，反對戰爭也不是人道主義的哭泣求憐所能奏效的，而是要以能根本消滅戰爭的力量來反對戰爭。例如，殖民地和半殖民地的為獨立解放的戰爭，便是反對現世界的主人帝國主義者的，因而也是一種根本消滅戰爭的進步的戰爭，好的文學就當贊助和歌頌這種進步的戰爭。在戰爭中優秀的作家應該向大家說：「民眾是為少數人而戰。少數人是——因戰爭而喫肥的啖屍鬼！」同時優秀的作家更應藉文學之力來喚醒弱小民族和眞正反戰的人羣，以反抗那些「因戰爭而喫肥的啖屍鬼」，根本消滅戰爭。</p>

<h3 id="c223">鮮貨棧的「老客」 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>瀋陽通訉　在瀋陽車站附近有三十多家鮮貨棧，約可容納「老客」二千多人，都是各地商行派在這兒常川「駐莊」的。</p>
<p>在貨棧常川「駐莊」的「老客」們，他們不但要替本店採辦進貨，同時還要替本店的出品大做其廣告宣傅和兜攬生意；其責任之繁重，實不亞於一個外交　上的駐外全權大使。他們日常的工作也和大使公使們一樣，每天除了對本店報告當地的巿况外，還得為本店的貨物施展商業的手腕，折衝於各大巿塲。所以，一家商店的營業的盛衰，「老客」們是操有全盤命運的。</p>
<p>要做一個「老客」，說起來倒也頗不容易，他們大部份都是從學徒做起，要具有豐富的商業經騐，爛熟的珠算，老練的口才和有禮貌的態度。我們沒事時祇要走到車站附近頭道溝那裏許多貨棧裏一看，總可看到在堆着許多貨物的院落裏，常有三五個面露笑容（或許是欲哭不得）的「老客」在和客人們作交易上的談判，那種謙和的態度使你一見就可以和他們訂交的。</p>
<p>在這裏充當「老客」的人，大部份都是籍隸樂亭，昌黎，灤州一帶，就是在長春，在商業上佔優勢的也多半是他們的同鄉，所以做「老客」的祇要操的是樂，黎，灤一帶的口音，在交易上是會佔有很大便宜的。可是現在，因為日本商業資本的侵入，打擊了往日樂，黎，灤的商業勢力，這班「老鄉親」的「老客」們也就不能像往日那樣的過安逸生活了。</p>
<p>至於「老客」們的私生活，說來也頗有興趣。他們每年雖經手成交不下幾千百萬的生意，但要想在他們辦公的地方找出一張寫字檯子却很不容易。他們進行生意的談判大都是在麻將桌上，或者烟榻旁邊；不管是有好大的數目的交易，都祇要在這種地方就可一言决定，另外也有到茶館裏去接談的。非常奇怪，在瀋陽這地方，打牌吃鴉片倒是很自由的。所以，一般「老客」的日常生活程序便可由這裏分出兩部分來。上午八時至十二時的時間差不多都用在打算盤上面，出貨進貨，忙得「不亦樂乎」。把十二點鐘的午飯一吃，便是消遣的時候了，也可說是開始新的買賣的手談；棧房裏麻將檯子一擺，進出莊的「老客」們便都不必邀請就自己會坐下來，一面談着話，一面門派，從世界大勢談到個人的生活，由閒話而談到正經，於是便「言歸正傅」了，他們的買賣就都是這麽在閒話上成交的。一家大規模的客棧，每天麻將至少總有十幾桌以上，就是比起一個俱樂部來也並無遜色；賭博的輸贏也很大，反正他們祇要一批貨色買到了好的價格，麻將上面輸一點錢是滿不在乎的。這裏所說的還不過是一部分上了年紀的「老客」們，因為年齡的關係，大都不肯走動；另外還有一班青年「老客」，他們的腦筋也和老年「老客」一樣的麻木了，他們的嗜好，多數是不喜歡吃烟而歡喜嫖，尋花問柳，堂子裏總是少不了他們的足跡的。</p>
<p>一個「老客」的薪水所入，照一般的情形說起來，大槪每年可有三四百元，可是實際上誰也不能替他們說出一個確實的數目。因為做「老客」的人，十個中間倒有九個自己要帶做點個人交易，一天賺多少錢是沒有一定的準則的。還有，許多「老客」自己就是老闆，所以要想把他們的收入作一個統計，却也頗不容易。而且，一個「老客」，無論他是做出口或進口生意，他對於價格方面總是可以操縱的；出口的貨色賣的價錢高，他便從中吃下一部份，進口的貨色買的價格低，他也可以暗中增加一點，本店對於他們都是予以全權，不加過問的。所以一個「老客」在外面，如果對於本店稍有一點不忠實，那這家商店就非得關門不可，一家商店的壽命的長短都是操在駐外的「老客」的掌握中的。</p>

<h3 id="c224">新年獻辭 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>時光如駛，日月不居，轉瞬間，民國二十四年又於吾人欷噓嘆息呻吟號哭聲中悄然消逝了。回首已往，旣不知涕淚之何從，遠囑未來，雖强欲歡笑而不得！國難當頭，人事日非，吾人處此年歲更新之際，萬感交集，旣凜終日悲觀之無補於實際，當思如何下决心，圖苦幹於未來之歲月。爰作「歲首的獻辭」。</p>
<p>一，所望於行政人員者　夫國家政治基礎築於地方自治，故欲求國家基礎的穩固，首須謀地方自治之完成。但欲謀地方自治的完成，應先事作訓練民眾之工作。可是訓政至今已逾五載，試問訓政工作是否已臻完善而無些微欠缺乎？負訓政工作之現任長官是否可告無罪於天下乎？嗚呼！不言則已，論事不免感慨。夫今日行政機關與行政機關中之行政人員不可謂不多，但一究其實，坐糜倉　，掛名簽到，優游終日者有之，只知埋首辦公桌上，致力於公文紙間，「等因奉此」忙個不了，實際事業非復過問，對上以報銷為主義，對己以食祿為目的，對人以欺騙為手段，對下以敷衍為能事，公餘多暇打幾句官話以自遣，閒來無事，擺一些官架以耀人者亦有之。事實如斯，結果可知，於是受「訓」已久的民眾年年如故，受「治」已久的地方事事依然。政治發動的機關旣如黑漆一團，所謂訓政成績自無異紙上談兵，如此訓政，國本安得奠定之時日，民族那來得救的機會？</p>

<p>籍以為為政不在多言，行政首貴決心，國難日亟，陸沈堪處，值此年凋景謝之際，正吾人送舊迎新之時，懲前毖後，既深悔於以往之乖謬，革面洗心，自有待於未來的努力，為國家計，為民眾計，吾人敢掬微忱，請命於一般行政人員之前曰：「請從民國二十五年起，拋動「積習」和「暮氣」，新春一般的朝氣和熱情，振起你們的精神，完成你們的使命，深入民間，勤求民隱，應與應革的事宜均須積極進行，對內對外的政策胥以民意為依歸，訓政工作，力求效率，不尚形式，不張場面，廢除口號標語，決心埋頭苦幹，勿自欺欺從，勿得過且過，走入新的年頭，創造新的生命，往事如烟，徒說無益，來日方長，願共努力。」</p>
<p>二，所望於青年者　　　　青年為人生最寶貴的時期，蓬勃的青春正是我們的寫照。青年亦為民族國家的中堅，青年時代若不打下厚實的基礎，將來事業的大廈必致無從向上建造。但是，青年們，在撸廊f象更新的時節，試清夜捫心，能無愧於自己，無愧於家長，無愧於師長，無愧於民族嗎？當然，能凜乎個人責任之重大，以及國家前途需才之孔急，而刻苦自勵，努力不輟者有之，但辜負父母師長的期望，浪費家長的血汗金錢，追逐於聲色之好，徘徊於舞榭之間，不知科學為何物，見書本已頭痛，世界事，朦朦朧朧，國家事，管他娘，以騙到文憑為滿足，能畢業做大官為目標者，更比比皆是。試問請撸腊銍規殖牵褡逯袌詠碡摵晌磥砻褡鍑业闹厝危瑒t那奄奄一息的民族國家的生命還不淪亡在他們的手裏，更待何日？</p>
<p>我輝煌如朝陽之青年乎！當此歲者，敢不盡一言以忠告乎？曰：「往者不可諫，來者猶可追，請從民國二十五年起確定你光明的人生觀，認識你正確的前途，鍛煉你前進的思想，為人羣，為國家，為家庭，為個人，均須勵一已奮發之氣，向人生大道上邁步。救國必先鍛煉體格，抗敵須　國防，除物質的國防外，精神的國防則有賴乎科學的昌明，文化之日進，試問我們的頭腦是否已經受嚴格武裝的訓練？諸如此類，聰明的青年們當能舉一反三，無庸喋喋，民族未來的主人，務希好自為之！」</p>
<p>三，所望於其他各辦刊　者　　　　國家之興盛有賴於民眾的羣策羣力，個人的成敗固僅一已之榮辰，但國家的興亡，匹夫不能辭其責。緬懷民國二十四年來，軍閥肆虐，政客搗亂，使國事一敗墮地，生靈不免塗炭，而最近帝國主義加緊作侵害中國的行動，使國土日　，國難食不果愈益嚴　，固非我們所能逆料，然吾國民眾平時怠於振作，混混噩噩，不作未雨之綢繆，以至事發而不可收拾，本春秋責備賢者之意，人民之罪責似亦難將軍後世的　評。</p>
<p>今二十五年的新歲又在吾人椎心泣血的　日中悄然光臨了，瞻今前途，益痛苦！而對各界人士之祈望尤為殷切。　曰：「請各界人士各懷履霜堅冰之威，從茲民國二十五年元旦起以救國為當前唯一的經常的生存目標，各下堅毅的決心，當如何振興實業，增植生產，以厚國力？當如何教育民眾，　揚救國要旨，以促民眾的覺醒？當如何開發荒原，溝通水利，以利羣眾？當如何……？凡各界人士均以此「當如何」的疑問，懸於腦際，分道揚鏣，各盡職責，將來殊途同歸，為救國雄厚的基礎，以之摧敵，何敵不摧？以之救國，何國不救？我各界忠誠的同工們，時　矣，事危矣！苟不急起直追，噬嚌莫及矣！」</p>

<p>— 常人</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞京城通訊</p>
<p>非洲販賣奴隸最盛行的地方，莫過於Slave　Coast了，撸赖胤教庫赌崛绽麃喓瓦_荷馬之間，其出口則為諾瓦港txgurh從撸姥Y販運出口的奴隸眞是多，若「過江之鯽」，但因為撸朗遣还_的賣買，所以空間有多少數目是無法統計的。撸佬┍毁u出境的奴隸，大部份都是運到南歐，北美中部及南美一帶去做開礦和屯墾的工作，過的簡直是連牛馬還不如的非人生活。主人對奴隸的待遇，是祇有的包含的供給，沒有金錢的報酬；而且所得的包含又粗　不堪，有時甚至連撸婪N粗　不堪的東西也不准吃個暢快。夜間睡眠，主人為了怕他們逃走，便在每人脚上釘了一副脚鐐，把幾十人或幾個人的脚拴在一起，有時一個人要起身，大家便都得連帶地爬起來。撸婪N拘束的嚴緊，簡直比一個殺人犯還過之；所以那些一經賣出作奴隸的人，在一千人中間也難有一個生還的。</p>
<p>三流有一種呌作Little　Negro的黑人，那是一種未開化的民族，到現在還在崇奉拜物教。他們的民族性極其強悍，但因為他們蠢如鹿豖，最易遭受欺騙，所以被運販出口的奴隸中，十停中倒有九停是屬於他們。甚至在黑人世界的非洲本部，他們也常時在被人家互相販賣着。</p>
<p>在喀麥降山和　山一帶的Little　Negro，那更是沒有離開原始人類的生活。他們每個人的生活工具衹有一副弓箭，此外別無長物；他們憑了那一副利器（？）便可以從容生存數十個寒暑。他們每天拿着一副弓箭，翻山越嶺，像猿猴般的東跳西竄，找尋食物，過着了野獸或單身的旅客，就把他們當作獵取和劫掠的對象；可是一日被販運做了奴隸，那他們卻又會馴服得像一匹綿羊一樣的。</p>
<p>此外，在非洲東北部也有着許多還沒有開化的民族。他們把自己的小孩賣給人家做奴隸，替人家做那些笨重劇烈的工作，到了十七八歲以膈，又會被轉賣到遠方去開墾荒地，任期飄泊流浪，度着非人的生活。在買過手做奴隸以後，他的一切的人權便都為主人所有，偶然觸怒了主人，即有被鞭撻的可能；即使被主人打死了法律也不會有什麼同情的裁判的。「人道主義」撸谰湓捲谶　裏是很難加以解釋的。甚是有的地方還承認「打死奴隸，不償命，不犯法」為一種習慣法呢。</p>
<p>一個小黑奴的售價，說起來眞是呌人不敢相信。據說從九歲至十一歲的小黑奴大約祇值得兩塊大洋的代價。所以有許多留住非洲的白人都很愛買撸婪N小黑奴回來侍侯自己的。</p>
<p>再，沿地中學，紅海及東非沿海一帶也有很多黑人被販賣作奴隸，他們整天的替主人作笨重而危險的工作，直到死亡或殘廢而後已，那也是沒有什麼代價蝗。另外還有一種青年女子也被販運到各　盛口岸，去供給輪船上的水手和茶房們滿足性欲，所得的代價簡直少得使人不敢想信；她們渾號呌做Blackstone。她們過撸婪N生活，到了相當年齡時，便又賣幾個小黑女奴來延續自己賣淫的生活。在士布的，巴巴拉，蘇亞金一帶，祇要船攏了岸，你就很容易見到許多赤足露體，肩上斜披着一條紅紅綠綠的披肩的賣淫黑女奴的。</p>

<p>— 濮漁</p>
<p>老頭子警惶的望著我，忽然瘋狂般的跑來掀開我的手，響起破鑼般的聲音：「你們的「公事」，我原就懂得！」老頭子的喉管漲得很大，死勁的捶胸口，「他是敲詐銅子的，他　欺壓老百姓的　今天公事，明日公事，我們的算法都……」</p>
<p>不等他說完，我便一耳光甩去，那老東西用盡全身力氣接住手掌，死勁給我一推，幾乎跌倒。</p>
<p>老頭子過度的疲乏，臉上現着死人的顏色，右手顫抖抖的指着我，有氣沒力的哼出一種嗓音：「你們這些害人的，我……」他拖起僵硬的身軀向我撲來，可是幾個踉蹌一交跌在地上。</p>
<p>我正在警惶的當兒，忽然幾個學生意的跑了進來，一壁攙扶那老東西，一壁亂叫：「逼死人味道！蛊死人啦！揍，揍那王八蛋！……」</p>
<p>我乘着慌亂的當兒，溜出了賬房，當第二句「揍那……」鑽入耳朵時，我已逃出大門了！剛跑到左　牆角，江錫五那小子掉轉頭說：「主任，好險啦！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Occupation of Five Counties in Eastern Chahar: Li Shou-hsin's Puppet Troops Open Zhangbei Mongolian Security Force, Xiao and Qin to Go to Tianjin to Continue Negotiations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Peiping: Regarding the Jidong-Chahar issue, after the Chinese and Japanese representatives held a negotiation in Tianjin, our side's principles have been taken to Changchun by Guifei Yuan for research. Gui will soon come to Tianjin from Changchun to continue negotiations. Our authorities have also telegraphed the Central Government regarding the latest developments in this issue. Yesterday, Chiang issued a telegram to Song Zheyuan and Zhang Zizhong, instructing them to uphold the principle of territorial integrity and handle the matter carefully. Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, and others will go to Tianjin for negotiations in three or four days after Tufeiyuan arrives. The five counties in eastern Chahar have already been occupied by more than 1,000 troops of Li Shou-hsin's puppet army. The Mongolian Security Force, claiming to be led by Zhuo Shichai of the National Salvation Army, is also gradually advancing towards Zhangbei, Kangbao, and other counties. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: A telegram from Zhangjiakou reports that the situation in the six counties of Chahar, including Guyuan, Kangbao, Baochang, Shangdu, Zhangbei, and Wanquan, remains peaceful. The puppet Jehol Military Region continues to dispatch a part of Wang Yongqing's brigade to Guyuan and Binchang to take over defense duties. Li Shou-hsin's puppet brigade will move to the border between Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia, as well as the western part of Chahar. Currently, there are more than 500 of our security team stationed in Zhangbei, more than 300 of Zhuo Shichai's Mongolian Security Force outside the city, and more than 300 of Li Shou-hsin's puppet troops. Since both sides have received orders to await a negotiated solution, they are currently coexisting peacefully. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: A telegram from Zhangjiakou reports that the newly appointed Japanese military resident officer in Zhangjiakou, Dabeng, flew to Changchun by plane on the 2nd. Regarding the resolution of the Chahar issue, he was summoned to Changchun by Itagaki, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to discuss the matter with Itagaki and Tufeiyuan. After returning, he will go directly to Ping to meet with all parties. Many refugees, old and young, male and female, from the Huoyuan and Baochang areas of eastern Chahar, have come to Zhangyuan to seek refuge. Due to the severe cold, some have suffered frostbite to their hands and feet, which is a tragic sight. The authorities are currently devising relief measures. Guo Yukai, the former magistrate of Guyuan County, fled to the province and reported the loss of Guyuan to the authorities. The provincial government will appoint him as the head of the Fourth Section. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Peiping: More than 1,300 troops of Li Shou-hsin's puppet army have advanced towards Zhangbei County, and Li himself is also there. At the moment, the Zhuo Shichai unit, which claims to be the National Salvation Army Mongolian Security Force, is also gradually advancing towards Zhangbei, Shangdu, Baoshou, and other six counties. Li's troops will retreat back to Dolon after the entire security force arrives. The heads of the Mongolian banners are scheduled to meet in Zhangbei County tomorrow to discuss the distribution of the Mongolian Security Force's defense posts. Guo Zhihan went to Zhangyuan a few days ago to investigate the Chahar issue. Guo returned to Ping from Zhang in the evening and visited Song Zheyuan this morning to report everything. Zhang Zizhong will also send someone to Ping to visit Song to report on the situation in northern Chahar. Regarding the Chahar incident, it is said that the authorities will handle it after the Jidong issue is resolved. (4th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Peiping: Since Li Shou-hsin's puppet army invaded Zhangbei County, Zhang Zizhong immediately reported to Ping. This side then engaged in informal negotiations with the Japanese side. The Japanese side hopes that both sides will send responsible representatives to hold a meeting to resolve the issue of the livestock and Mongolian Security Force stationed in the six counties of northern Chahar. After considering this, our side believes that the location of Zhuo Shichai's troops and others must be carefully discussed. It is said that the relevant parties gathered on the evening of the 2nd to make a decision and inquired Zhang Zizhong by telephone to provide instructions on the negotiation strategy.

<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1936, although we heard many voices calling for peace from all over the world, the fears and crises left over from the old year remained the same in the new year. The arrogance of the violent aggressors has not diminished with the change of age, and the frenzy of militarism has only intensified with the passage of time. Various international developments seem to be dragging the world toward war. The most noteworthy step in this development is the military alliance between Japan and Germany. This news was spread by the French "Humanity" newspaper and revealed by the Soviet TASS news agency. Although the Japanese side has denied it unofficially, judging from various circumstances, it is not impossible in fact. Because we are concerned about world peace, we should examine this issue.</p>
<p>The legend of the German-Japanese alliance did not just happen recently, but has been spread several times in the past year. The first was at the beginning of last year when Tokyo was rumored to be exchanging Manchurian soybeans for Germany's Zeppelin airships. This was certainly the first step in the alliance. At the end of March, when Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, observers in Geneva believed that the relationship between Japan and Germany would become closer. At the end of June, just as Eden visited England and Scotland, Germany also sent a delegation to travel east to Manchuria for a time. The international community focused its attention on the development of the German-Japanese alliance. Later, because of the outbreak of the Italo-Ethiopian War, the world's attention turned to East Africa and the Mediterranean, and the activities of the German delegation in Japan and Manchuria were ignored by the general public. But in fact, because the East African war dragged on, the international situation became more turbulent, and the collusion between the militaristic forces of Japan and Germany was carried out with all their might. The German delegation arrived in the puppet state at the beginning of December. In Harbin, they proposed the establishment of a company to supply machinery and materials to the puppet state and directly purchase soybeans from the puppet state. At the same time, they also suggested concluding a German-"Manchurian" trade agreement, but this was not successful because the Japanese side had no intention of doing so. On the other hand, according to French newspapers, Japanese military officers and Hitler's advisor Ribbentrop also held negotiations in Berlin. The so-called "military alliance" was probably facilitated in this area.</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned clues, it can be known that the legend of the German-Japanese alliance is not completely unfounded. Moreover, judging from the current situation, Japan and Germany are both poor imperialisms, both countries with rampant militaristic arrogance, both traitors to the League of Nations, and both countries that have torn up international peace treaties. The two can be sympathetic to each other, and in the policy of expanding their forces abroad, they can also use the banner of anti-Soviet Union to ease the opposition of other imperialisms. The recently rumored military alliance is actually a camouflage with an anti-Soviet alliance. However, although such camouflage is extremely clever, because the combination of Japan and Germany has a significant impact on the international situation, it cannot reduce the importance that countries attach to it. If the German-Japanese military alliance becomes a reality, Germany's power in Europe will inevitably increase, which is a threat to the French group. They will naturally insist on opposing it and form a closer unity with the Soviet Union to seek resistance. At the same time, Japan's power in the East will increase even more, which will be a major impediment to the interests of Britain and the United States, especially the United States. It will certainly express its opposition attitude. From the perspective of our country, the German-Japanese alliance is just like the Anglo-Japanese alliance before World War I, and its only victim is our country. The Anglo-Japanese alliance was a prelude to the deployment of World War I. The current promotion of the German-Japanese alliance is of course a harbinger of World War II. For the sake of the interests of our country and nation, and for the sake of peace in East Asia and even the world, we must resolutely oppose it.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Mongolian Premier's Speech in Russia Receives Widespread Attention <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Moscow. Moscow newspapers reported that Genden, the Premier of the "Mongolian People's Republic," spoke to reporters from various Moscow newspapers. Genden replied to reporters' inquiries, stating: "The actions of the Japanese and Manchukuo armies on the border of the Mongolian People's Republic last year have sufficiently demonstrated their aggressive nature and intentions. The Mongolian people have created their free and independent lives at a great price, with sacrifice and hard struggle. It has been fourteen years since then. We are engaged in peaceful construction, dedicated to developing the national economy, and improving the people's cultural standards and material lives."</p>
<p>"Before the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, we had no border conflicts and enjoyed an independent and peaceful life. However, since the arrival of the Japanese army in Manchuria, the situation has drastically changed. The 'Manchukuo army' has attacked our borders, plundering the land of the Mongolian People's Republic. We have repeatedly sought a peaceful life and have repeatedly tried to reach a peaceful agreement, but all have failed."</p>
<p>Genden continued that the purpose of Japanese aggression is first to make the Mongolian People's Republic lose its independence and become a second "Manchukuo" in order to continue to attack China and the Soviet Union. "We do not want to succumb, but wish to protect our borders and independence. We can predict that when the Mongolian Republic is attacked by the Japanese and Manchukuo armies, it will cause an even greater reaction from other countries."</p>
<p>Genden also spoke about the Mongolian delegation's impressions of coming to Moscow, saying, "We maintain close and friendly relations with the great Soviet Union, and we constantly receive the warmest care and assistance. Every Mongolian herdsman knows that the Soviet Union is our friend. They deeply desire that Mongolia can develop peacefully, and they know that when we are victims of aggressors, they will surely come to our aid. I have come to Moscow to resolve some everyday problems."</p>
<p>Finally, Genden described the attack on the Manchukuo-Mongolian border by the Japanese and Manchukuo armies on December 19th last year, saying, "We have heard that they are preparing to launch another attack. We have warned 'Manchukuo' that if such attacks are made again, the serious consequences that will result will be borne by Japan and Manchukuo. We will certainly protect our independence and will not allow ourselves to be attacked. We have this ability and determination."</p>
<p>Genden also said that he believed that once Mongolia is attacked, it will receive the sympathy and assistance of countries that advocate peace. (TASS dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Moscow. Genden, the "Prime Minister" of Outer Mongolia, and Demid, the "Minister of the Army," and their party have come to Soviet Russia for consultations. Foreign sources say that this trip is to conclude a secret military agreement with Soviet Russia. The official side of this question specifically denied it. As for the reason why the Outer Mongolian authorities are staying in Russian territory, the spokesperson of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs refused to give any explanation. It is generally believed that the talks currently being conducted by the Russian and Mongolian authorities, with the participation of the Outer Mongolian "Army Minister" Demid, must be of a political nature. Foreigners believe that the Soviet Union's foreign policy has always emphasized pacifism, and that it is unwilling to clearly express that the interests of the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia are the same, so as not to conflict with Japan. This decision by the Russian and Mongolian authorities to conduct talks, and to discuss in detail from a technical perspective the issue of Soviet national defense on the border with China, seems credible.

<h3 id="e24">New Trends in the World Silver Problem: U.S. Treasury Secretary Negotiates with Mexican Treasury Secretary, and There is Talk of Holding an International Conference <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Washington. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that negotiations between the U.S. authorities and Mexican Treasury officials are bound to benefit silver-using countries, and that close cooperation on this matter is truly beneficial to silver-producing countries. The decision to consult now is based on the procedure established by President Roosevelt when the Silver Purchase Act was passed. At that time, President Roosevelt said that the U.S. President intended to initiate talks on monetary policy with neighboring countries. Now Mexico is the first to come here for discussion. After this, the U.S. government will conduct similar discussions with other countries. Some people are asking whether Peru and Canada will be invited to discuss the matter. Morgenthau replied that it will be done separately, but that he cannot say much at this time. Senator Pittman, a silver advocate, said that Morgenthau has faithfully implemented the silver purchase procedures and that the method of silver talks is also commendable. Senator Thomas said that it is doubtful whether the Treasury Department is earnestly purchasing silver, and also said that the U.S.-Mexico talks may be a prelude to a world conference. The United States should first unite Mexico, Canada, and the silver-producing countries of South America, and then unite the silver-using countries of the Far East, in order to fight against managed currency groups. As for the events discussed in Washington, official circles in Mexico City are currently not commenting, but according to financial experts, silver price agreements must be under discussion. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington. Well-informed observers here stated yesterday that the recent confirmation that the United States has exchanged gold for silver from China may be intended to cooperate with Britain to consolidate China's currency plan. Treasury officials do not want to criticize this matter, but at the same time, some quarters cite China's December report on silver shipments to the United States to confirm this statement, and claim that the Treasury Department feels uneasy about the increase in U.S. gold reserves to over $10,000,000,000, considering this to be an unhealthy phenomenon. Senator Pittman's statement that gold will eventually flow out of the country to assist the stability of most countries makes this theory more forceful. The United States silently wishes for the strength of the Chinese government, because this kind of strength is a condition for cooperation in this ideal. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that his preliminary talks with Mexican Treasury official Suárez lasted an hour and were quite beneficial. They will continue to be held this week. Neither Morgenthau nor Suárez is willing to discuss the contents of the meeting with others. It is said that in addition to agreeing on a more detailed method for the U.S. Treasury Department to purchase Mexican silver, the talks between the two sides will also involve Mexico's implementation of a bimetallic reserve system. (Reuters dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Washington. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau hinted today that the United States has already convened an international conference to encourage the adoption of gold and silver as currency standards based on an adjusted basis. At the same time, Morgenthau continued to meet with Mexican Treasury Secretary Suárez and said that satisfactory results have been achieved and that talks will continue on Monday. Regarding the question of whether silver-producing countries will unite to oppose the British pound and managed currency groups as advocated by Senator Thomas, Morgenthau said, "I believe that close cooperation is the duty of silver-producing countries." Morgenthau did not want to elaborate on this statement, but specifically asked the questioner to refer to President Roosevelt's message to Congress on the silver issue in 1934. In that message, President Roosevelt stated that the world's supply of silver is very large and its uses are very complex, so if the world wants to adopt gold and silver as the standard of prices, then the cooperation of silver-producing countries is essential. The President further stated, "We should seek a world agreement, but the United States may take action alone for its own interests. For this reason, I have consulted with several neighboring countries on the issue of adopting gold and silver as currency standards based on an adjusted basis. This agreement can often make the purchasing power of currency more stable than any standard to date." It is generally believed that Morgenthau's emphasis on President Roosevelt's statement proves that talks with other governments have entered an active and important stage. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington. Senate silver advocate leader Thomas said today that he hopes that the talks between the U.S. and Mexican financial authorities will ultimately lead to an agreement to convene a silver conference, with Mexico, the United States, and Canada participating. This conference will be the preliminary step towards a world silver agreement to fight against the trend of managed currencies. Thomas has repeatedly declared that if the silver purchase plan does not take effect, he will also implement managed currency in the United States as a self-defense measure. He further stated today that the entire silver issue is related to the forces of managed currency. If silver-producing countries cannot unite and use gold and silver as currency standards, they cannot compete with this kind of force even for a day. He hopes that Mexico, Canada, and the United States can agree on a bimetallic standard, and that Chile, Peru, and other Latin American countries can also participate later. Finally, it can be expanded to silver-using countries such as China and Egypt. The United States can exchange part of its gold reserves for silver, so that silver-using countries can also have an appropriate bimetallic reserve. (National Telegraph dispatch from the 1st)</p>

The Longhai Railway has allocated three trains to transport stone. It is expected that the excavation of the diversion river, the extension of the Jiangsu dike, and the closure project can be completed simultaneously in the third month of spring. The recent shift of the slip stream to the left is also of considerable assistance to construction. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Discussing Red Leaves <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Editor-in-Chief of the Science Society of China, Zhang Chubao</p>
<p>People who live in cities are usually suffocated by the foul, turbid air, and feel very uncomfortable. But when they step onto verdant grass and admire green branches and leaves, they can't help but exhale deeply, feeling refreshed and filled with a sense of novelty. Green is the color that most easily stimulates human senses and brings pleasure. Trees present an inviting green color in their appearance, and physiologically, because their leaves contain chlorophyll, they can absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by people and release the oxygen necessary for human respiration. Therefore, people who frequently spend time in forests are generally healthier than others.</p>
<p>As the seasons progress from late spring to mid-spring, and then to early and mid-summer, the leaves also gradually deepen in color from yellowish-green to light green to dark green. Day by day, the green deepens until autumn arrives. The pitiful green leaves, unable to withstand the pressure of the autumn wind, gradually lose their former luster and take on a dull color. The green slowly fades, and yellow or red takes its place. This is a melancholic time for trees. Just as the saying goes, "An old woman's yellowed pearls are worthless," trees at this time also evoke a similar sentiment. However, when we look into the mountains and forests at this time, the red light shines brightly, illuminating the entire mountain like a raging fire, and people experience another kind of interest. "Going to see the red leaves" becomes a seasonal activity in autumn. We will not imitate literary figures in composing poems or writing prose to appreciate red leaves. Instead, let us discuss the various aspects of red leaves from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>First, let us ask: how are red leaves formed? The formation of red leaves is due to the presence of anthocyanins in the cells of the leaves. Anthocyanins are often found in the flowers, leaves, stems, and roots of plants, giving them a red, blue, or purple color, and often masking the green color of chlorophyll contained in the leaves, purely displaying these colors. Anthocyanins and chlorophyll are both pigments contained in cells, and they often coexist. Both are soluble in water, alcohol, or ether. According to Livingston and Maximov, when such a solution changes from acidic to neutral or alkaline, the color will also change from red to purple or blue, indicating that the color change is related to the change in acidity. According to Harvey, anthocyanins are related to glucosides (glucose derivatives present in plants, decomposed into glucose, alcohol, or other compounds by the action of alkali, acid, or enzymes) and have the same function: the formation of anthocyanins depends on the presence of glucose. Usually, whenever the environment is suitable for the production of a relatively high concentration of glucose in cells, such as at low temperatures or upon exposure to light, the occurrence of anthocyanins is more abundant. This may explain why red leaves are more commonly seen in the colder seasons of early spring and autumn.</p>
<p>Now that we know the cause of the formation of red leaves, we should ask: what is the significance of red leaves? What role do they play when leaves turn red? We know that there are two types of red leaves: normal red leaves and variant red leaves. Begonias and *Tradescantia zebrina* have red undersides of their leaves. Poinsettias (*Euphorbia pulcherrima*), and *Alternanthera ficoidea* have all or part of the leaves near the flower parts turning red. These all belong to normal red leaves, but their purposes are different. It is generally accepted by scholars that the red leaves of *Alternanthera ficoidea* and poinsettias indicate the location of the flowers to insects, facilitating pollination; but it is said that this is not the case for begonias and *Tradescantia zebrina*. It is generally believed that red color on the surface of leaves can be said to be a defense against excessively strong sunlight, reducing evaporation, but the red color inside the leaves is not the same. Many plants in the forests of Java are red early in the season. The air in the forest is very humid, so saying that it prevents sunlight and evaporation is naturally inappropriate. Therefore, Stahl explained that this is to absorb more of the red rays with high heat to increase evaporation, which is exactly the opposite of the previous explanation. The transformed red leaves are the red leaves seen in spring and autumn that I am going to discuss now. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Grand New Year Celebrations in Various Countries: Soviet Union Celebrates for the First Time Since the Revolution; Hitler Declares Last Year the Year of Freedom <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: For the first time since the revolution, a formal New Year celebration was held today. Schools, factories, hostels, and theaters competed with each other in celebrations to demonstrate the reality of Stalin's recent declaration that "life is getting better." Thousands of people gathered in the city throughout the day to buy Christmas trees, which were strictly prohibited in the past. The Moscow Central Park held a skating competition, accompanied by military music, with more than 25,000 participants. Many entertainment venues were open all day. According to managers, sales of strong alcohol decreased, while sales of light alcohol increased, so there were fewer drunk people than in previous years. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Moscow: The entire Soviet people joyfully celebrated the New Year. All newspapers published the great achievements of the Soviet Union last year. The *Pravda* editorial stated that the greatest achievement of the First Five-Year Plan was the elimination of unemployment in cities and poverty in rural areas, and that last year rapidly improved the lives of workers and peasants. The Soviet Union will not only be the richest country in the world, but also the most culturally developed country. Raising the cultural and technical level of the working class to be equal to that of engineers and technicians is the current task. Last year's economic success was enormous, with all sectors of the national economy completing their plans ahead of schedule. Transportation in various regions has been rapidly improved, and agriculture has completed its planned targets. The most important event was the widespread development of the Stakhanovite movement. This makes the historical struggle between socialism and capitalism certain to be won by the Soviet Union. As the Soviet Union enters the New Year, it can certainly guarantee even greater victories in the future. (3rd, TASS)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Okada released a New Year's statement, which briefly stated that our country has encountered various difficulties in the past few years, and now the country is in a state of leaping forward, which is also an inevitable situation. Under the Emperor's authority, we are very pleased to overcome these difficulties with the united strength of the people. However, the difficulties have not yet been resolved. The international conference on naval disarmament is currently being held in London, and the Japanese plenipotentiary representatives are working diligently to uphold just claims. Furthermore, there are still many domestic problems to be solved. At the beginning of this year, we sincerely hope that 100 million compatriots will cooperate and strive together to promote the development of the nation's fortunes. (1st, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Berlin: Head of State Hitler's New Year's address to the nation was broadcasted by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. He said, "The goal of this year is to maintain discipline, protect European culture, and fight against the enemy of mankind, namely, Bolshevism. Bolshevism aims to incite revolution and bloody tragedies to endanger world order and provoke various nations to be hostile to each other. This was the case in the past, and it will continue to be the case in the future." The Head of State then mentioned the rebuilding of armaments, saying that "Last year was the year Germany regained its freedom. After the revival of our country's army, our strength has increased even more, and therefore our responsibilities have become even greater. Recently, disturbances have occurred frequently in foreign countries, and comparing them with our country's clear and stable politics, the superiority or inferiority is self-evident." (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hitler issued a New Year's address to the army, which said, "Germany has restored the freedom to arm itself and has re-established itself among the strong countries. I now express my gratitude to all officers and soldiers and to those who have contributed to the reorganization of the army. I am very pleased with the achievements of the past year, and I propose the slogan for 1936: 'March forward for peace, honor, and national strength!'" The German Army Chief also issued a New Year's address to the army, which briefly stated, "Since the reintroduction of conscription, the new year for serving the country and nation has now begun. We should unite and fight for Germany and the leader." This is sufficient to demonstrate the political concept of the German nation, but the unemployment problem has not yet been fully resolved, low wages have not yet been sufficiently raised, and the material and intellectual wealth of the entire country has not yet been able to provide opportunities for all the people to enjoy. "We need raw materials to overcome various difficulties, and these difficulties may not decrease in the coming year, but we have done our best to fight for this." (1st, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>New York: The New Year celebrations here today were the most lively since the New Year of 1928-29. Mayor La Guardia canceled the noise ban, so thousands of people gathered in Times Square with trumpets, sirens, and other noisemakers, playing music and blowing horns, creating a cacophony of sounds. At that time, the four characters "1936" made of electric lights atop a certain height shone brightly. The business of restaurants and taverns was the most prosperous in many years. Although the price of each ticket was five to ten dollars higher than last year, there was still no room for latecomers. A total of 1,100 licensed bars in New York were allowed to open all night, compared to 700 last year. More than 1,200 police officers were on duty in Times Square. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Athens: Former Prime Minister Venizelos, who was originally the leader of the Republican Party, fled abroad after the failure of the revolution in March last year. He recently entrusted former Foreign Minister Roufas to send New Year's greetings to King George II, saying, "At the beginning of a new year, I wish that the constitutional monarchy of our country will be consolidated under the rule of Your Majesty, and that those who have been frequently involved in internal strife for 20 years can unite as one in the future."

<p>London: On Tuesday night, the Imperial Airways airship *Cathay* sank into the Mediterranean Sea while flying from Crete to Alexandria, killing twelve people, including two women. The only survivor was the pilot, Mr. Wilson, who was rescued by a British destroyer after floating in the water for six hours. He is currently hospitalized in critical condition. According to reports from Alexandria, the airship was carrying nine passengers, whose names are unknown, and four crew members, namely the pilot, Mr. Wilson, an engineer, a wireless operator, and a handyman. The airship had sent a wireless message stating that it had arrived in Alexandria, but unexpectedly sank into the sea a few miles from the mooring point in the port. British destroyers and tugboats rushed to the scene of the accident, but could not find the wreckage of the airship. The British destroyer *Glowworm* was the first to arrive and rescued Mr. Wilson. Although a thorough search was conducted overnight, no trace of the others was found. At dawn, aircraft joined the search, and two bodies were found yesterday afternoon, along with fragments of the crashed airship. The cause of the accident cannot be known until the pilot, Mr. Wilson, can speak and experts have examined the wreckage. It is believed that the three engines in the airship failed one after another within a few minutes. The sunken airship is currently being salvaged and may be salvaged within 24 hours.

<h3 id="e59">U.S. Congress Opens; Roosevelt's Message Warns Warlike Nations; Advocates Using Moral Force to Resolve Wars; Economic Recovery is Effective, No Need to Increase Taxes <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt delivered his annual message to Congress tonight, providing a comprehensive comparison of the world situation in early 1933 and the present.</p>
<p>The President recounted his inaugural address on March 4, 1933, to the joint session of the two houses, stating that the crisis at that time was purely national in nature. The ideal world was a peaceful illusion, and it was rationally hoped that obstacles to mutual trust and trade would be removed. Since then, the Good Neighbor policy has spread throughout the Western Hemisphere. As for the other parts of the world, the infighting is lamentable. Since the summer of 1933, the policies of the rulers of most major countries in Europe and Asia have not shown the path that peace and human goodwill should follow. As a result, the American people have had to acknowledge the growth of animosity, the trend of aggression, the competition of armaments, and the breakdown of emotions. The various factors at that time were sufficient to cause the tragedy of a general war. Most countries, if they could allow it to develop, would be willing to resolve their problems peacefully, but their rulers must consider the attacks of other rulers who cannot abide by the principles of improving the human race by peaceful means. The people of these countries blindly follow leaders who hope for autocratic power, hoping to expand their territory, correct the illegality of past wars, or seek outlets for selling goods and accommodating people. Because the people are impatient, they turn to believe in a policy of force or have the delusion that only they can accomplish a special mission. I admit that what I said is not something any country wants to hear. Their feelings can be obtained by those who hope for peace, but do not have to adopt scheming tactics, and the sympathy of the country. This is the common problem of diplomatic relations in Europe and Asia today. Ninety percent of the world's people are willing to abide by the current borders and reduce armaments. The remaining ten percent force other nations to arm themselves and restrict the continued efforts of the navy, so there is little success. The reason is sitting here. The policy of the United States hopes to limit armaments by peaceful means, resolve disputes by moral force, and oppose the high-pressure policies of autocratic classes.</p>
<p>The President cited the U.S. Neutrality Act, stating that if war cannot be avoided, then the countries of South and North America should maintain good order and neutrality, have sufficient national defense strength, and should do their best to mediate and restore peace to the belligerent countries. History proves that autocracy threatens peace, and countries that uphold democracy have never had such a crisis.</p>
<p>A small number of powerful financial and industrial organizations oppose the New Deal, but the government's reform plan has finally been completed. However, the representatives of the privileged class hope to regain political power. They borrow the constitution of the country to benefit themselves. It is no different from the fallacy of entrusting guardians and shareholders to use the property entrusted to them for political struggles.</p>
<p>The President also accused his political enemies of oppressing workers, shareholders, and consumers, and of proposing to abolish government programs, because they were confident that these proposals would hinder the recovery. The President continued to criticize enemies who openly advocate employing child labor, suppressing wages, abolishing social security procedures, terminating agricultural relief and work relief, and canceling the right of workers to organize. Do we really want to abolish the laws protecting investment and allow the people to be preyed upon by fraudulent speculators? The autocratic classes do not hope to restore the old system, but wish to seize centralized power. If we retreat step by step, then they will demand endlessly and will seize power and enslave the people. The autocratic classes intend to use the idea of terror to achieve their wishes.</p>
<p>The President cited the progress of industry and commerce, stating that the near balance of the federal budget is due to increased tax revenue, but the government has not levied new taxes. He is confident that there is no need to levy new taxes. The recovery has made significant progress, so the country's relief expenditure will be reduced in the future. The President asked Congress to move forward, saying, "I believe you will not disappoint the people in the future, because you have now faithfully met the expectations of the people." The President's speech was broadcasted across the country by wireless, and it is estimated that more than 15 million households listened to it. (3rd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e60">U.S. House Proposes Permanent Neutrality Act; Expands the President's Power of Disposition <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The Second Joint Session of the 74th Congress was held today. It is predicted that although the session will be short, the debate will be very fierce. The Chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House, Pittman and McReynolds, jointly proposed the Neutrality Act after the meeting. The bill stipulates: Mandatory prohibition of the transportation of military materials to belligerent countries; Permission to prohibit the export of excess commodities, food, medicine, and major products; Mandatory prohibition of the trading of securities of belligerent countries, except for securities issued by non-governmental charitable organizations; Embargoes shall be implemented as soon as a state of war exists, but Congress may declare its opposition; The President may issue a statement that Americans who trade with the people of belligerent countries must bear the risk themselves. McReynolds further stated when proposing the bill that he intends to amend the bill so that countries in North and South America that are engaged in foreign wars are not bound by the bill, in order to comply with the spirit of the Monroe Doctrine. The two houses gradually agreed to listen to President Roosevelt's annual message tonight and then adjourned the meeting, reopening at 9:00 PM. At the same time, fifty members of Congress who support the Patman Bonus Bill held a meeting and decided to demand that the House consider the bill before January 13, at which time the bill will automatically be placed on the House agenda. Patman said that the committee intends to draft a joint plan at the meeting to be adopted by the Senate and House. We should end the issuance of tax-exempt securities, because our country has huge gold reserves and can issue good currency. (3rd, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McReynolds introduced the permanent Neutrality Act in the House today, allowing the President to selectively prohibit the export of war materials and retain the existing power of prohibition. According to McReynolds, the authorities are satisfied with this bill. It was drafted only after lengthy consultations with President Roosevelt and State Department officials. Under this bill, the President may have the power to restrict the shipment of goods related to war, so that the amount shipped to belligerent countries is limited to the normal amount. However, food and medicine are not subject to this restriction. He will propose an amendment stating that if an American country is at war with a non-American country, then this American country may be exempt from the arms embargo. This bill prohibits financial dealings with belligerent countries. The purpose of this bill is to create a legal system to implement President Roosevelt's policy that any trade with belligerent countries is the responsibility of the merchants themselves and has nothing to do with the government. Senator Pittman also introduced a neutrality bill in the Senate this afternoon, allowing the President to restrict the amount of goods shipped to belligerent countries that exceeds the normal amount. Democratic Congressman Ludlow also introduced a third and more aggressive neutrality bill in the House, advocating that after the outbreak of war, the United States should prohibit the export of goods or any loans to belligerent countries. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: The wartime Neutrality Act passed by Congress at the end of August last year, and promulgated by the President, will be effective until the end of February of this year. Now that Congress has reconvened today, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McReynolds is about to introduce a new Neutrality Act to the House, intending to amend the current law to make it a permanent Neutrality Act. Its content advocates authorizing the President to act as he sees fit and expand the list of embargoed items. All raw materials necessary for war may be prohibited from being transported to belligerent countries without distinction, unless specifically authorized by the United States Congress. McReynolds recently announced that this bill had been discussed at length with President Roosevelt, and the government had deemed it appropriate. As for when Latin American countries are at war with countries outside the Americas, this provision cannot be used in general. An amendment is now being proposed to maintain the Monroe Doctrine and prevent aggression by countries outside the Americas. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>New York: The first reaction of the financial community here to President Roosevelt's address to Congress was that there were several reassuring points in the Head of State's speech, especially the fact that no new legislation was proposed. This shows that the time for respite is expected to be extended. The statement in the article that there is no need to levy new taxes is also welcomed by the public. President Roosevelt said that according to the current law, he believes that there is no need to levy new taxes or increase existing taxes. The recovery is now making great progress, so the country's relief expenditures can be reduced in the future. The Senate and House have now decided to extend the meeting until Monday of next week (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Geneva: League of Nations officials and diplomats listened to the U.S. President's address to Congress via wireless before 4:00 AM this morning and paid close attention to it, because their words may have a significant impact on the League of Nations' future sanctions against Italy. In theory, how the League of Nations' sanctions are implemented has nothing to do with the United States, but in fact, those who maintain the League of Nations deeply hope that President Roosevelt will teach them. Current public opinion here believes that if President Roosevelt's remarks on belligerent countries are adopted by Congress, then the League of Nations' vote on the oil embargo against Italy can be taken one step further, because the United States has already set a precedent, and although the amount of oil that the United States normally exports to Italy can be kept as usual and not prohibited, the amount is not large enough to meet Italy's needs. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Although the official circles here had high expectations for President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday, they are unwilling to express their opinions, and they are also unwilling to comment on the attitude taken by the United States towards belligerent countries. Those who actively advocate sanctions against Italy believe that President Roosevelt has issued a clear warning to aggressive and autocratic countries, but they especially dislike the fact that the Neutrality Act still has shortcomings. Some parties have expressed their joy, because many European countries have already expressed their opposition to the oil embargo against Italy, and now that the President of the United States has made a statement, it must be very persuasive. In short, those who enthusiastically advocated sanctions have now been greatly disappointed. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>Rome: Official circles refused to comment on President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday. Political observers believe that the oil embargo, although embarrassing to Italy in spirit, is not important economically, because Italy's reserves of liquid fuel are sufficient for the East African war. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: Diplomatic circles do not have a good impression of President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday, fearing that after the United States adopts new measures on neutrality and expands the list of embargoed items, Germany will be forced to join the sanctions front against Italy and take actions that it is unwilling to take and are more severe in accordance with the outline set by the League of Nations. Up until now, every time Britain has tried to urge Germany to participate in sanctions, Germany has always said that other non-member countries, especially the United States, have not yet participated. Now that the position taken by the United States is similar to the League of Nations' policy, it will be difficult for Germany to refuse. As for the evolution of the neutrality issue in the United States, diplomatic circles here are paying sympathetic attention to it, and say that if the United States had refused to sell war supplies to belligerent countries in 1915, it would not have been caught up in the whirlpool of the European war. In some respects, it is believed that if the United States prohibits the transportation of oil to belligerent countries in accordance with the Neutrality Act, then the oil-producing countries in Europe will only be the three countries of Soviet Russia, Romania, and Britain, and they will naturally sit back and enjoy the benefits. In addition, political leaders have also greatly criticized President Roosevelt's remarks in his speech criticizing autocratic politics, saying that British Prime Minister Baldwin had previously criticized dictatorship in the same tone, which shows that Britain and the United States have formed a joint relationship and formed a joint front to oppose militarist dictatorship. This is almost a warning to Germany and its leader Hitler. (4th, Havas)</p>

<p>Cairo: After Nahas, leader of the National Party, on behalf of the "National Front" composed of various political parties, expressed to Sir Lampson, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, his willingness to accept the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1930, the new British Foreign Secretary Eden replied yesterday, saying, "I am urgently dealing with the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and have not yet been able to discuss the Egyptian issue at length. After Egypt holds elections and establishes a constitutional government, negotiations can naturally proceed without any objections." After receiving this reply, Egyptian Prime Minister Nessim told our reporter that Foreign Secretary Eden was not using delaying tactics. The British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Lampson, is scheduled to meet with Sidky, the leader of the Egyptian People's Party, tonight for discussions. Afterwards, representatives of various political parties in the "National Front" will gather at Prime Minister Nessim's official residence, and Sidky will report on the results of the meeting. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Since the National Front, composed of various Egyptian political parties, issued a statement expressing its willingness to accept the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1930, Britain and Egypt should immediately proceed with negotiations. The British Cabinet has decided to hold a meeting next Wednesday, and the Egyptian issue will be one of the important items on the agenda. The main points of the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1930 are as follows: Egypt may join the League of Nations; neither of the contracting countries may conclude an alliance treaty with a third country that would harm the interests of the other party; the contracting countries shall conclude an alliance treaty to jointly resist foreign aggression; Egypt shall provide the British army with supplies and facilities for passage; the Suez Canal is of great importance, and Britain has the right to station troops at certain strategic locations in Egypt to protect it; the existing consular jurisdiction in Egypt shall be abolished; Sudan shall continue to be jointly administered by Britain and Egypt. The Egyptian National Party had previously expressed objections to the fourth and especially the sixth articles. Among them, Britain considers the following two items indispensable: (A) Britain must continue to station troops in the Suez Canal region and even in other locations in Egypt, especially given the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and the concentration of Italian troops in the Libyan colony; (B) Sudan should continue to be ruled by Britain, and Britain may allow the Egyptian government to participate in administrative matters there. In addition, Britain will insist on retaining British military advisors employed by the Egyptian army. As for the Egyptian police, which have been under British control, Egypt is eager to break free from these constraints, and Britain may accept a compromise, namely, the head of the police department may be an Egyptian, but the police advisor must be a Briton. Given this situation, there are already many difficulties in the negotiations between Britain and Egypt. It is generally believed that before starting negotiations, Britain will require the Egyptian government to stop anti-British demonstrations. (3rd Havas)</p>
<p>Cairo: The British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Lampson, met with Mamo, the leader of the Liberal Constitutional Party, last night to discuss British Foreign Secretary Eden's reply regarding the restoration of the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1930. It is reported that Mamo still felt that Eden's reply had many loopholes and hoped that the British government would reconsider its answer. The "National Front," formed by a coalition of parties, insisted on accepting the draft Anglo-Egyptian Agreement negotiated by National Party leader Nahas and the late British Foreign Secretary Henderson in 1930.

<h3 id="e62">Soviet Union's Foreign Trade Last Year <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet General Taxation Administration announced that the total value of the Soviet Union's foreign trade from January to October 1935 was 496,779,000 rubles, with exports of 299,112,000 rubles and imports of 197,667,000 rubles. Among the exported goods, light and heavy industry, timber, and food industry products accounted for 80.6%, while agricultural products accounted for only 18.3%. The trade during this period compared with the same period in 1934 is shown in the following table: (Ten months of 1934) (Thousands of Rubles) (Ten months of 1935) (Thousands of Rubles)</p>
<p>Exports: 343,022 299,112</p>
<p>Imports: 189,808 197,667</p>
<p>Total: 532,830 496,779</p>
<p>Trade Surplus: 153,214 101,445</p>
<p>From the above table, the export value in 1935 decreased slightly compared with 1934, while the import value remained largely unchanged. The decrease in exports was 43,910,000 rubles, mainly due to a decrease in food exports. At the same time, the export of heavy industrial products such as pig iron, machinery, and cement increased. For example, the export value of pig iron from January to October 1934 was 433,000 rubles, which increased to 2,814,000 rubles in 1935. The export of machine tools and electrical components increased from 2,520,000 rubles to 4,085,000 rubles. The export value of timber industry products was 75,305,000 rubles.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's trade volume with various countries is as follows (Thousands of Rubles):</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's trade with various countries has changed slightly this year. For example, although the total export value has decreased, exports to Britain have increased by 9 million rubles compared with the same period in 1934, exports to the United States have increased by 10 million rubles, and exports to Iran have increased by more than 4 million rubles. Trade with Germany has decreased significantly, while French imports from the Soviet Union have increased significantly. (December 11th TASS communication)</p>

<p>London: According to a dispatch from the Abyssinian capital today, the Red Cross relief team recently sent to Abyssinia by Sweden was destroyed during an attack by ten Italian planes. All of Europe was shocked by this news. The number of deaths and injuries is still unknown, but according to the latest news, in addition to team leader Dr. Hylander and two other doctors, Smith and Holm, and one male nurse being injured, all other staff members died tragically. Dr. Hylander was injured in the back. The team was formed through national fundraising in Sweden. Upon hearing this tragic news, Sweden was filled with grief and anger, and many flew flags at half-mast to express their condolences. A certain newspaper in the Swedish capital stated that this news dealt a major blow to the country. The Italians' actions were a crime against international law. Italian planes actually dropped bombs on the relief team, which proves the brutality of the Italian army's combat methods. In the eyes of people all over the world, this behavior can be judged as Mussolini's barbaric war. The Abyssinian Emperor has sent a telegram of condolences to Prince Carl of Sweden. At the same time, a representative of the Abyssinian Red Cross has gone to General Desta's headquarters to investigate the matter. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: The whole country now views the bombing of the Swedish Red Cross relief team by Italian planes as a national disaster. The International Red Cross has sent a telegram of condolences and stated that the Abyssinian representative, Dr. Junod, is now flying to the site of the disaster to conduct an investigation. Telegrams of condolences from all over the world are arriving in succession, including one from the British Red Cross. Several newspapers commented on this bombing as similar to the German submarine sinking the American ship Lusitania on that day. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: After yesterday's report of the Italian planes bombing the Swedish Red Cross relief team in Abyssinia, the Swedish people mixed shouts of "Revenge Italy" and "Down with Mussolini" with New Year's greetings. The Italian embassy here has been surrounded by mounted police dispatched by the authorities for strict protection. Last night, many "vigil gatherings" were changed to memorial services for the victims of the Red Cross team. Various organizations are now planning a large demonstration to protest the atrocities of the Italian planes. The exact number of deaths and injuries in the Red Cross team is unknown, but according to the latest news, in addition to team leader Dr. Hylander and two other doctors and one male nurse, all team members died tragically. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: According to the authorities, Italian planes bombed the Swedish Red Cross relief team and injured the team leader, Dr. Hylander. This is the second Swede injured. In addition, 30 Abyssinian wounded soldiers, 50 Abyssinian male nurses, and several soldiers were killed. According to reports received here, a total of 12 Italian planes flew over the area where General Desta's troops were stationed and dropped leaflets signed by General Graziani, stating that Abyssinian troops had brutally murdered an Italian air force officer, so they must be retaliated against. Fifteen minutes later, Italian planes dropped many heavy bombs from an altitude of several thousand feet, including gas bombs. Among the dead were two Italian wounded soldiers who were being operated on by doctors. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: When Italian military planes bombed the city of Dolo on the southern route, the Swedish Red Cross rescue team was affected. Team leader Dr. Hilander and his Abyssinian assistant Langsterro were seriously injured at the time. Dr. Hilander arrived in the capital this morning and told our reporter that his assistant had died of his injuries. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: The Abyssinian government sent a strongly worded note to the League of Nations because Italian military planes bombed the Swedish Red Cross rescue team. According to the latest news, the Abyssinian government threatened that if Italy continued to act in violation of international law, it would confiscate Italian property in Abyssinia as retaliation. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: The people, angered by the Italian planes bombing the Swedish Red Cross rescue team in Abyssinia, are now urging the Red Cross not only to send a team to replace the previous team, but also to send hundreds of doctors and nurses to Abyssinia to show revenge. Many young people across the country are enlisting. It is now expected that the team destroyed by Italian planes will soon be replaced by a new team. Today, according to a public announcement, although the latest news is not as serious as the initial reports, the perpetrators have not been able to reduce their guilt. According to Roman semi-official documents, the Italian air force took this retaliatory action because it heard that an air force lieutenant was captured by Abyssinian troops and then brutally murdered. During the attack, a document was dropped saying, "You will get your due revenge." The document also stated that the bombs of the Italian planes fell into the Swedish Red Cross camp, seemingly injuring two Swedes. In this battle, many Abyssinian soldiers were killed or injured. The Abyssinian government issued a statement declaring that the Italian authorities' claim to cover up their atrocities, that Abyssinian troops had murdered an Italian air force officer, was a despicable lie. At the same time, the International Red Cross has asked the Italian military authorities to order Italian planes not to attack two Abyssinian planes carrying two wounded Swedish doctors to General Desta's headquarters. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The government has just issued a bulletin, describing the situation on Monday when Italian military planes bombed the Swedish Red Cross rescue team in Dolo City, on the front line of the southern route of Wogadun. The bulletin stated, "At 7:00 a.m. that day, twelve Italian planes flew to the defense area of Prince Desta on the southern route and dropped leaflets signed by General Graziani, the commander-in-chief of the Italian southern route. The content stated that two Italian air force personnel had been beheaded and displayed by Abyssinian troops, and the Italian army had to retaliate. Fifteen minutes later, these Italian planes flew to the location of the Swedish rescue team and dropped bombs from a height of several hundred meters, several of which contained poison gas." (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: A special dispatch from our correspondent regarding the bombing of the Swedish Red Cross rescue team in Dolo City, Abyssinia, by Italian military planes, announced here that there were no Swedish casualties. After this news came out, people's hearts were greatly relieved, but various evening newspapers still greatly criticized the Italian air force's atrocities. The "Arlunda" newspaper expressed hope that Sweden would be stimulated to endorse the League of Nations' sanctions policy against Italy. The "Evening News" asked the government to lodge a protest and try to protect overseas Chinese. According to Italian military planes, before dropping bombs, they flew very low, and they must have been able to see the Red Cross signs and the Swedish personnel in the service group at a glance. The executive committee of the Swedish Red Cross attaches particular importance to this. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Sweden originally had no diplomatic representative stationed in the capital of Abyssinia. After the Swedish Red Cross rescue team in Dolo City, Abyssinia, was bombed by Italian military planes, the Swedish government asked the British government to investigate the incident on its behalf. The Foreign Office has instructed Sir Barton, the British Minister to Abyssinia, to conduct an investigation. As for the protection of the lives and property of Swedish overseas Chinese in Abyssinia, Sir Barton has also been instructed to do so. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: Regarding the case of the Italian military planes bombing the Swedish Red Cross rescue team in Dolo City, Abyssinia, although there were no Swedish casualties, powerful sources here still believe that the issue of the Italian military violating international Red Cross conventions has not been resolved. As for the handling of this case, there will be no action until the report from Sir Barton, the British Minister to Abyssinia, and the Red Cross has not yet been sent. However, the newspapers are urging the Italian government to lodge a protest and demand that the responsible personnel be punished and compensate for the losses. According to Italian military planes, before dropping bombs, they flew very low, and they must have been able to see the Red Cross signs and the Swedish personnel in the service group at a glance. The executive committee of the Swedish Red Cross attaches particular importance to this. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Dr. Hylander, the leader of the Swedish Red Cross rescue team, met with Reuters correspondent Mr. Collins today and described the situation of the Italian military planes destroying the team near Dolo. Dr. Hylander angrily said, "This was a completely deliberate action. In the days before the bombing, Italian military planes often fired machine guns around the team. On the morning of the bombing, I was working in the operating room when suddenly bombs and machine gun bullets rained down. I just saw two rows of Italian military planes, three in each row, attacking the rescue team, and I was already hit by bullets and lost consciousness. When I opened my eyes again, I saw a tragic scene in front of me that was heartbreaking. Dozens of people were lying dead or wounded around me. Those who were injured but not dead were either screaming in pain or groaning. The tents were on fire and burning fiercely, which increased the panic. I cannot estimate how many bombs the Italian military planes dropped, at least over two hundred, and tens of thousands of machine gun bullets. After inspection, there was one tent with 425 bullet holes. The total number can be imagined. Deputy Medical Officer Longstrem, although seriously injured, still shouted, 'I must save the wounded!' Another assistant, Longgren, was slightly injured and immediately rescued the wounded. The Swedish and Abyssinian male nurses who escaped serious injuries worked very bravely, but the tents were on fire, the smell of bombs was irritating, and the crowd was in panic, so the work was very difficult. All the medicines we had prepared were destroyed by the bombs, so today we can only use very crude methods to treat the wounded. After the bad news spread, the soldiers under General Desta rushed to clear the debris and hide the wounded in a safe place, fearing that the Italian military planes would return. The Italian military's actions cannot be excused under any circumstances, because our team abides by international conventions and hangs the Red Cross sign high, which can be seen by Italian military planes in the sky. The Italian military's claim that Abyssinian leaders and soldiers were hiding in the Red Cross rescue team is absolutely unfounded. Even the guards provided by General Desta do not live with the rescue team. My assistants outside the operating room at the time of the bombing said that the Italian military planes were flying very low." Dr. Hylander, after being injured that day, flew from the southern route front to the Abyssinian capital by plane, accompanied by another Swedish doctor, Mr. Smith, three Abyssinian people, and the team's mascot, an antelope. The antelope was also injured during the bombing by the Italian military planes. The plane carrying Dr. Hylander and others was a Fokker giant plane, driven by Baron Rosen, and arrived here from the southern route front through an unknown wasteland. Only one foreign journalist, Mr. Collins, was at the airfield. When the plane landed and the engine stopped, the moans and cries of pain of the wounded could still be heard in the sound of the propellers rotating. The first person to appear from the plane was Dr. Hylander, who staggered into the waiting ambulance, followed by three seriously injured Abyssinian people, Dr. Smith, and an antelope.

<h3 id="e64">Italy and Abyssinia Prepare for a Major War <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>London: The general headquarters of the Italian and Abyssinian armies are now busy preparing for a large-scale offensive. The most intense battles since the start of the war three months ago are about to break out. The location of the major battle seems to be on the northern front. Italian planes have been unusually active on the southern front recently. The Abyssinian army now views this as a precursor to the Italian army launching an attack from this section first. However, General Naiyabu, the commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian army on the southern route, has completed his preparations for an early offensive. Dagabur was bombed fiercely by four Italian planes again yesterday, but there were no reports of deaths or injuries. At the same time, according to news from the Abyssinian capital, the Italian army outposts on the northern front have retreated from the southeast, south, and southwest of Magale because Abyssinian General Mullugushtai is now leading the Abyssinian elite, including a portion of the Imperial Guard, attacking from the southeast and is unstoppable. It is reported that Mr. Mullugushtai has also received the assistance of 12,000 troops from Abyssinian Emperor's cousin, General Gemane. At the same time, the Abyssinian capital is now recruiting new soldiers. All able-bodied men who have not served in the military must report the reasons for not enlisting. Today, an edict of Abyssinian Emperor was read on a certain street in Harar, which said, "Anyone who intends to evade military service to defend against the enemy, I will personally punish them." The document ordered the people of the entire province who are able to wield a spear to register in Jijiga by the end of January. Deserters and those who evade enlistment will be severely punished. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to news from various sources, on New Year's Day, the Abyssinian war, in addition to the major battle in Danane on the Somali Front, the town of Danane, located on the western side of Kelagehai, which is strategically important in transportation, was captured by the Italian army after a courageous melee. In this battle, both sides used rifles, bayonets, and sharp blades to fight. According to Italian military planes, about 100 Abyssinian soldiers died and many were injured, while the Italian army suffered fewer casualties. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: It is now believed that Italian General Coracciani will launch an offensive against Harar and Jijiga in the near future. It is reported that he will use planes and light tanks to assist in the battle. His troops have increased from 45,000 to 75,000. Today, a mail ship sailed from Naples to Mogadishu, carrying 2,000 soldiers, mostly gunners and the remaining members of the Blackshirt Militia. A total of 12,000 members of the Militia have been sent to East Africa, two-thirds of whom have arrived in Somalia. It is reported that there is another entire division, totaling 18,000 men, which will be transferred from Libya to Somalia. The first batch has already passed through the Suez Canal. Another division of Madama soldiers transferred from Italy to Libya will replace them. In the next few weeks, Somalia will begin to rain, and the Italian authorities are eager to achieve a major victory in February. It is now believed that General Graziani's first task will be to establish solid flank defenses to defend against the offensive of General Desta, the governor of Sidamo, who is related to the Abyssinian Emperor. However, the general attack will likely be launched at Sasabane. Major Barnes, Reuters war correspondent, recently went to the Dolo front. It is reported that military activity in the area is greatly increasing. He saw a large number of military supplies and bullets stored in Ruf Filandi, which is heavily defended by four forts with high walls. There is also an excellent airfield on its side. Thousands of soldiers are camped outside the town of Ruf Filandi, surrounded by transport vehicles equipped with machine guns. Both Italian and Ethiopian soldiers seem eager to fight. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Harar: The Abyssinian Emperor issued an edict today ordering all able-bodied men in the country to enlist in the army. This edict has been read in the thoroughfares of Harar and Jijiga, which stated, "Anyone who is unwilling to enlist and kill the enemy for the country will have their property confiscated. The people must assist the police in searching for deserters, and even their relatives will be punished. I will personally go to the front to supervise the army and set an example." It is generally believed that the Abyssinian army will take the offensive on the southern route, which can be seen from the signs in this edict. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Tigre Front: Italian military planes bombed the town of Amba Alerkate in the Walkaide area on the northern route, but there were no casualties. Italian reconnaissance planes also reappeared over the Guaran area near Lake Aganc. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Semi-official sources recently announced that since the start of the war in East Africa, the Italian air force has damaged a total of four planes, three of which were due to engine failures and were unable to continue working. The whereabouts of the other plane are unknown. It was reportedly shot down by Abyssinian troops near the city of Magale on the northern route, but this was yesterday's event. There are no other losses. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Abyssinian government issued a bulletin today stating that Italian military planes have dropped as many as 1,000 bombs near Magale in the past week, including poison gas bombs.

<p>London: Regarding the issue of mutual assistance between Britain and France, British experts are now meeting with the naval, land, and air force attachés of the French Embassy to determine the detailed measures for implementing mutual assistance when Britain and France are attacked. According to information obtained by our reporter, Britain and France have completely agreed that in addition to providing naval assistance, if France is attacked by a third country while reinforcing its defenses in areas bordering Italy, Britain will also provide assistance in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 3, of the League of Nations Covenant. Regarding the security of the French border on the Rhine, France has not requested special guarantees from Britain. Regarding this matter, Britain has promised to provide naval assistance to France, but the land and air forces cannot take immediate action because Britain's plans to expand its air force and reorganize its army to make it mechanized are still in progress and have not yet been completed.

<p>London - Mr. Anderson, a special military correspondent for Reuters in Sollum, reported details of the equipment on both sides of the Egyptian-Libyan border. He said he drove 600 miles through the desert from Alexandria and arrived at his destination. On the way, he was forced to stop due to car damage, but was later assisted by the Royal Army Signals Corps and was able to continue. Italian border guards are now watching from the blockhouses and rooftops day and night. If any abnormal signs are seen, a plane is immediately sent up for reconnaissance, but it has never crossed the border. Egyptian camel patrols, with their heads wrapped in black cloth, are perched high on the sand dunes at key points, watching the Italian army's barbed wire defenses along the border without the slightest懈怠. On New Year's Day, he visited an Italian army outpost to offer New Year's greetings. The Italian soldiers exchanged cigarettes with him and were very polite. On New Year's Eve, the British soldiers celebrated by singing various songs, which could also be heard by the Italian side. The steel helmets worn by the British soldiers and the armored vehicles they carried were the same color as the desert. If the Italian army attacks from the west, the survival of Sollum is uncertain. Recently, a large detachment of Egyptian infantry went to defend it. If the Italian army attacks from Cyrenaica, it will not encounter resistance until it reaches Mersa Matruh, 150 miles inside the border. However, British troops have arrived in Sollum in the last two weeks and are now deploying some defenses. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Northern Manchuria - Discovery of a Land of Little People - Men Under Three Feet Tall - Total Population Over 800 <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Manchuria Daily News reported that on December 23 last year, the Harbin Railway Bureau's Railway Hospital, in order to investigate the sanitation along the railway lines under its jurisdiction, sent doctors to various locations along the lines to investigate the situation. Unexpectedly, a surprising "village of little people" was discovered near "Wuchang" and "Lade" on the Labin line. The village has a population of over 800 people, all of whom are under three feet tall, and they do not like to talk to ordinary people, forming a unique tribe of their own. Their lives are semi-primitive and they have no culture to speak of. Since the recent opening of the railway, modern culture has gradually been reflected in their minds, and they regard it as a terrifying thing, so they look at general society with disdain. The most incredible thing is that those with short stature are entirely men, while the women are relatively tall. Currently, Dr. Lizi Wang of the Railway Bureau's Mental Hospital has gone to the land of little people and selected 30 people to bring to Harbin to vigorously study their physiology. According to the hospital's doctors, the water quality in the area where the tribe lives is very poor and contains a large amount of iron. However, it is still questionable whether this is the cause of their stunted growth, as the tribe's daily food is the same as that of other Manchurians. However, due to their short stature, their operational efficiency is less than half that of ordinary people. Currently, anthropologists have obtained this rare data, which is causing a great sensation.</p>

He demanded that Uruguay provide written evidence proving that the Soviet embassy was providing substantial financial assistance to the Brazilian revolution. Minkin demanded that Uruguay provide concrete facts, specifying the dates, amounts, and numbers of the checks. Uruguay believes that the Soviet embassy delivered the checks to a certain organization, which issued them in turn, and that this organization was the place where the Soviet embassy provided assistance to the Brazilian revolutionaries. Therefore, Minkin demanded that Uruguay specify the name of this organization. (TASS dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, accusing Uruguay, in accordance with Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Covenant, of failing to submit the key points of the dispute to the League's arbitration court or the League's Administrative Council before unilaterally severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, which violated Article 12 of the Covenant.

<p>Moscow - The Soviet government has decided that, starting from January 1, 1936, the Foreign Trade Commission will prohibit all economic organizations from purchasing Uruguayan goods. The former Iugantorg Company, which specialized in Soviet-Uruguayan trade and had a majority of its shares held by Soviet economic organizations, has now decided to convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to dissolve the company. In recent years, Uruguay's trade with the Soviet Union has consistently shown a surplus, and in the first eleven months of 1935, Soviet imports from Uruguay exceeded Soviet exports to Uruguay by three times.

<p>President Chiang delivered a speech on New Year's Day at the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "The Essential Path to National Self-Salvation and Saving the Nation." The original text is as follows: "Fellow countrymen across the country, today is the first day of the 25th year of the Republic of China. It is a day for all of us to rejoice and celebrate together. Although I cannot personally meet with you all at this time, I can speak to you personally on the radio, which is a very gratifying thing. I would like to take this opportunity to talk to all of you about the most important tasks for our country and all of our fellow countrymen this year. As everyone knows, the situation in our country is very dangerous and urgent, and we are in a state of crisis at every moment. However, the fate of the nation is entirely determined by all of us. If we want to save the Republic of China, which is shared by 400 million fellow countrymen, and if we want to revive the most ancient and glorious Chinese nation in history and culture, I believe that one thing lies in the efforts of the Republic of China itself. In other words, it lies in the efforts of 400 million fellow countrymen, that is, every citizen of the country must be able to work hard and be self-reliant. As the saying goes, 'The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual.' Now that everyone knows that the nation is in such a crisis, everyone, no matter who they are, should take these two maxims to encourage themselves, understand their duties, take responsibility, be of one heart and one mind, work together, have firm aspirations, unite in spirit, and advance bravely together towards the goal of saving the country and the people. We must understand that saving the country is not such a difficult thing. As long as everyone can make tireless efforts to do what they can do, I believe that no matter how urgent the crisis our country is in, we can save it within this year, so that it can turn from danger to safety, from weakness to strength, and from misfortune to blessing. We know that no matter which country, when it wants to be rebuilt, or which nation, when it wants to strive for revival, it must suffer many disasters and encounter great dangers. Conversely, a large country and a weak nation will never truly awaken and strive for self-improvement and revival if they do not encounter many disasters and great dangers. Therefore, although our country and nation are now suffering unprecedented disasters and encountering enormous dangers, we not only do not need to be pessimistic or worried, but we can also see that the more foreign disasters and the greater the current dangers, the faster the opportunity for the revival of our country and nation will come. The ancients said, 'A country that has no external enemies will perish.' They also said, 'Sorrow in the legs and feet is what inspires sages, and many difficulties are what revive a nation.' This is the meaning of this. Our Chinese nation has the most ancient and glorious history of 5,000 years, the beautiful rivers and mountains of 40 million square miles, and even more 400 million fellow countrymen who account for a quarter of the world's population. Look at which country or nation in the world can compare to our greatness? As long as all of our citizens can strengthen their confidence in the nation and truly stand on their own and be self-reliant, what else is there to fear or worry about? Our country can definitely be saved, our nation can definitely be revived, and it can be revived starting this year.</p>
<p>From now on, how should we be self-reliant and self-reliant? Or, what are the methods of saving the country and reviving the nation in the future? As I said just now, as long as everyone does what they can do well, it is self-reliance, and it is the way to save the country and revive the nation. The most important and most basic point is the New Life Movement, which everyone has known about and has been working hard to promote for the past two years. The meaning of the New Life Movement is to enable all of our fellow countrymen to restore the inherent moral spirit of our Chinese nation - propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor - and to first realize it in daily life habits such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, so that our citizens, each and every one of them, can at all times and in all places understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor, and no longer do anything that is contrary to propriety and righteousness, lacking in integrity and honor, and use propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor to establish the personality of ourselves and the entire nation, and wash away all the past shame of each of us and the entire nation. A person must have a noble and independent personality in order to be qualified as a modern citizen, to be worthy of being a modern citizen, and the country must also have a dignified and independent personality in order to be qualified as a modern country, to be worthy of being a modern country. Whether it is an individual or a country, as long as one's own real personality can be established, no one will dare to bully us, and no country will dare to invade our country. Otherwise, not only will people oppress us and invade us, but they will also destroy us. As the saying goes, "People must insult themselves before others will insult them, and a country must attack itself before others will attack it." This is a definite principle. Therefore, if you want people not to bully, oppress, or invade us, the only way is for everyone to encourage themselves and strive to establish the personality of modern citizens, which is to work together to establish the personality of our country, and the basic effort is to restore the inherent moral spirit of our nation. The inherent moral spirit of our nation is actually the basic requirement that the citizens of all civilized countries, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, must possess. Therefore, all of our fellow countrymen must keep in mind at all times the two sentences "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor" and put them into practice. All the previous chaotic, scattered, perfunctory, lazy, extravagant, lascivious, selfish, apathetic, numb and insensitive corrupt lifestyles must be swept away and eradicated. It is not good to continue to be confused and be a backward person of the barbaric era, but to resolve to "die yesterday and live today", remove the old and establish the new, and practice the "orderly, clean, simple, diligent, fast, and reliable" new life, and be a "understand propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor" new citizen. Once we all become modern new citizens, we can certainly establish a modern, civilized, strong new country, and we can certainly stand shoulder to shoulder with others and stand on the basis of freedom and equality.

<h3 id="e81">Responsibilities that the Government and the People Should Fulfill - Chairman Lin's New Year's Day Radio Address <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Lin of the National Government delivered a speech at the Central Broadcasting Station at noon on New Year's Day, entitled "Responsibilities that the Government and the People Should Fulfill in the 25th Year of the Republic of China." The original text of his speech is recorded below. "Today is the New Year's Day of the 25th year of the Republic of China. I have a few words to offer to my fellow countrymen across the country. The Fifth National Congress resolved last year to convene the National Assembly within the 25th year of the Republic of China. Subsequently, the First Plenary Session resolved to announce the draft constitution on May 5, to complete the election of representatives to the National Assembly before October 10, and to convene the National Assembly on November 12. According to this resolution, we must unite as one and work together with the government this year in November in order to achieve twice the results with half the effort, to complete the mission entrusted to us by the Fifth National Congress, and to achieve the goal of completing autonomy and implementing constitutional government. Therefore, we feel that the responsibilities we bear this year are several times greater than last year. The more responsibility we can fulfill for the country, the more achievements the country will certainly be able to achieve. The more efforts our fellow countrymen across the country can make for the country, the more progress the country will certainly be able to make. If we can unite in good faith under this principle and work together, not only can local autonomy be completed on schedule, and constitutional government can be implemented on schedule, but also our country can turn from weakness to strength, we can raise our country's position in the international community, and we can promote the revival of our Chinese nation. The ancients said, 'The plan for the year lies in spring.' Today is New Year's Day, the beginning of spring, and it is also the day we start to refresh our spirits and intensify our work. From today onwards, everyone must fulfill their own responsibilities, and every hour must do an hour's worth of work. Everyone should contribute all their energy and all their intelligence to the country and to society, and we must earnestly follow the teachings of the President, taking loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace as the foundation for cultivating ourselves and establishing virtue, and taking the Founding Strategy and the Founding Program as the compass for our country's nation-building and governance. The so-called cultivating oneself and establishing virtue requires everyone to be able to self-discipline and be honest in public service. If everyone can be self-disciplined and honest in public service, then the country's politics will naturally be clear, and the country's construction will naturally progress. The President's Founding Strategy and Founding Program that he showed us will naturally be fully realized. The President's will said, 'I have devoted myself to the national revolution for forty years, and its purpose is to seek freedom and equality for China.' If we now want to achieve the President's goal of seeking freedom for China, we must first contribute the freedom of individuals to the country, and gather the freedom of 400 million people to become the entire freedom of the Republic of China. If we want to achieve the President's goal of seeking equality for China, we must all fulfill more obligations and not compete for rights. Everyone should shoulder the obligations they should fulfill to the country, and everyone should contribute the private rights they should contribute to the country. Everyone should first seek equality of obligations, and not just seek equality of rights, and then the country will develop substantial strength and will achieve an equal position in the international community. We should all base ourselves on this meaning, everyone should set an example, sacrifice the freedom of each individual, and seek freedom for the country, and everyone should contribute their rights to the country and seek equality for the country. China's achievement of freedom and equality is not only the happiness of the Chinese people, but also the foundation of peace in East Asia will be further consolidated as a result, and it can maintain long-term peace in the world and promote the common happiness of mankind. Therefore, our current efforts as Chinese people are not only related to the survival of China itself, but will also affect the safety and security of the world. We should work hard for the sake of China's survival, and we should also work hard for the sake of the world's safety. This is my contribution to my fellow countrymen across the country today. I hope that all my fellow countrymen across the country will unite as one and work together from this day onwards. I am willing to encourage myself together with my beloved fellow countrymen across the country."</p>
<h3 id="e82">Capital Held Celebration of the Founding of the Republic of China <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters Held Ceremony at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, Chairman Lin Delivered a Speech on Behalf of the National Government</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: On the 1st at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held a ceremony at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum to commemorate the founding of the Republic of China and to pay respects at the mausoleum. From Zhongshan Gate to the mausoleum's main avenue, military police and the Mausoleum Administration's security team had increased patrols in advance, maintaining strict security. Although snowflakes were falling and a cold wind was blowing, the attendees included Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Ding Weifen, Zhang Ji, Jiang Zuobin, and over eighty others. There were approximately two hundred staff members above the rank of Secretary-General from the Central Party Headquarters, all faculty members and students (including recruits) from the Central Military Academy, and all faculty, staff, and students from the Central Political School, totaling several thousand people. The total number of participants was estimated to be over six thousand. Upon arriving at the mausoleum, everyone lined up according to the designated locations. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, dressed in military uniform and wearing a sword, stood on the central stone steps in front of the memorial hall. All Central Committee members were dressed in blue robes and black mandarin jackets, arranged by age. Staff from the Central Party Headquarters wore blue cloth uniforms, and faculty and staff from the Central Political School wore military uniforms, standing on the right side of the platform. Thousands of students from the Military Academy and the Political School lined up along the stone steps, all the way to the stele in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's tomb at the bottom of the steps. At 9:00 AM sharp, music was played, and Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, presenting wreaths from the Central Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee. After the ceremony, Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech, the gist of which was: "Comrades, soldiers, twenty-five years ago today, our Dr. Sun Yat-sen worked hard to revolutionize and overthrow the Qing Dynasty, liberate the Chinese nation, and bear the important task of establishing the Republic of China. It was on this day that he took office as the Provisional President of the Republic of China in the capital. What glorious and great history! And how honored and excited we are today to hold such a glorious and great commemoration in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum in the ice and snow. Everyone must know that today is the most glorious day for our Chinese nation and the most glorious day for our Kuomintang. I hope that all party members and compatriots across the country, during this extremely difficult period, will work hard to complete Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings to preserve this great glory. Finally, I wish all comrades and soldiers a happy and healthy New Year, and I wish everyone success in their aspirations." The speech lasted over thirty minutes, after which music was played to announce the end of the ceremony. As the meeting adjourned, Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek nodded to all Central Committee members, Central Party Headquarters staff, and senior Military Academy faculty to express his New Year's greetings.</p>
<p>National Government: The National Government held a celebration ceremony at 10:00 AM in the National Government Auditorium to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Chairman Lin Sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and the presidents of the three Yuan (Executive, Legislative, and Judicial), as well as Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Deng Jiayan, Jing Hengyi, Zhou Zhenlin, Qin Zhen, and others, along with National Government staff, civil officials above the rank of Senior Rank and military officers above the rank of Colonel from various ministries and commissions, totaling over eight hundred people, attended. After Chairman Lin Sen led the ceremony, he delivered a speech, saying, "Everyone, today is the first day of the 25th year of the Republic of China, which is also the day twenty-five years ago when Dr. Sun Yat-sen took office as the Provisional President in Nanjing, the founding day of the Republic of China. As we recall how Dr. Sun Yat-sen founded the government amidst difficulties and hardships twenty-five years ago, and the various teachings he left us, we feel ashamed that there is still much work we have not yet fully accomplished. The ancients said to get rid of the old and establish the new. Although the old work has passed, it should still be reviewed. The new work should be diligently advanced. Our responsibility this year is even greater than last year because the Fifth National Congress decided last year that a National Assembly should be convened within the 25th year of the Republic of China. The First Plenary Session also decided that the draft constitution should be announced on May 5th this year, and the National Assembly should open on November 12th. Such major events cannot be accomplished without the whole country preparing wholeheartedly and making doubled efforts. Therefore, this year's work must be even more urgent than last year's. The draft constitution has already been discussed by the President of the Legislative Yuan and many experts across the country have also contributed their opinions. The Central Political Conference has also discussed it many times and a committee has been specially established to study the matter. However, there are still two key points in the draft, namely: 1. What obligations should citizens fulfill to the state and what rights should they enjoy? 2. How should the powers of the central government and local governments be defined to be appropriate? We still hope that all sectors of society across the country will contribute more opinions. The Central Government will definitely accept them sincerely during the study. Although May 5th is still several months away, the various preparations before the announcement of the draft constitution cannot be delayed. The procedures for convening the National Assembly are even more complicated because our country has a vast territory and a large population, and the situations in each province are not the same. To uniformly complete the election according to law requires the cooperation of the people and the government. This is my greatest hope today. We should ensure that these major events are completed on schedule so that constitutional government can be implemented as soon as possible, and the people can fully fulfill their obligations to the state and fully enjoy the rights granted by the state. Today is the first day of the 25th year. May everyone work together." After the speech, a group greeting ceremony was held. First, everyone bowed three times to Chairman Lin Sen, who returned the greeting. Then, civil and military officials bowed to each other once. Thus, the solemn celebration ceremony concluded amidst the melodious music.</p>

<p>The first day of the 25th year of the Republic of China was the anniversary of the founding of the National Government. Various agencies held celebrations. Although it rained on that day, various agencies, schools, and organizations held group greeting ceremonies at their respective locations. The county government hosted a banquet on this day for leaders from all walks of life and heads of various agencies to mark the joyous gathering. The Local Education Center held a local newspaper exhibition from the first day of the new year to the third day, collecting various local newspapers from the city for public viewing. These included newspapers such as the "Political Review," "Rong Bao," (a newspaper from the founding year of the Republic) "Jiufeng Bao," and "Song Bao" (a newspaper from the fifth year of the Republic), all of which were hosted by well-known figures at the time. Their discussions were lively, and reflecting on those times provides valuable references for social changes.</p>

<p>The Ye-Ci Teahouse on the main road outside Changmen, had been in operation for hundreds of years. According to legend, the owner of the store made his fortune from a Ye-Ci, hence the fame throughout Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the business was booming. In recent years, due to the impact of the social downturn, liquidity became a problem, and Luo Jintang, the owner of Ling Jiahe Teahouse and Ziyangguan Wild Game Restaurant, took over the business. He had a goods fire insurance policy worth 2,800 yuan with the Lao Gongmao Company and a property decoration fire insurance policy worth 1,400 yuan with the Taiyang Company. On the second day, the store was empty and no one was inside. The employees had all left through the back door. As a result, in addition to the complete destruction of the store, the neighboring Yan Demao Tea Shop, Xin Xin Barber Shop, Jin Rui Xing Hotel, and other stores were also destroyed, totaling seven rooms. The building was owned by Yi Xing Real Estate Company, which also had a fire insurance policy worth 5,300 yuan with the Tianyi Company.</p>

<p>In Qianzhou Town, the ninth district under the county's jurisdiction, on New Year's Day, over two hundred refugees from Hunan arrived. The town head provided them with rations and escorted them out of the town by the business association. Unexpectedly, when the refugees arrived at Yinqiao in Tangping Township, the tenth district, they saw Zhou Yichun's family collecting dues. Without asking why, they broke into the house and looted 124.7 yuan and 180 yuan in silver, two gold buttons, several pieces of silk clothing, and other items before fleeing. Zhou Yichun, unwilling to accept the theft of his silver, went outside to report the incident. Neighbors rang gongs to gather people, intending to retrieve the stolen silver, and removed the bridge planks. Two refugees, Zhang Xiaofu and Zhang Xiaoqing, attempted to escape by swimming across the river but drowned. The refugees then made trouble for Zhou Yichun. The Qianzhou Business Association was informed and arrived at the scene to suppress the unrest. On the third day, Tu Zheng Zhou Deming reported the incident to the local court. Prosecutor Shen went to the countryside to investigate and confirmed that the two had died after falling into the river. Tu Zheng prepared coffins for burial, but the refugees refused and continued to cause disturbances in the village. The Yuqi Public Security Substation reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau and requested the dispatch of troops to the countryside to escort the refugees out of the area.</p>

<p>In the Erdao area of the Qi'an Town jurisdiction, over thirty bandits had infiltrated from the northeastern coast, robbing nearby towns and villages and killing police officers.

<p>Letter from Chu Wu Shi: Respected Editor, I recently read in your newspaper's December 28th issue, on page eight, a report about myself, Chu Wu Shi, being arrested for opium use in Xu. Upon reading this, I was extremely shocked, as it concerns my reputation. I am writing to request a correction to preserve my reputation. Furthermore, my late husband's concubine, Chen Jingqiu, has not returned to her hometown for several years. My division of property with my father and brother, Chu Yufeng, is well known to my relatives and cannot be swayed by rumors. I am writing to inform you of this, and I urge you to make a correction. Chu Wu Shi. The statement "currently working at the First Branch Bureau" is a misunderstanding based on hearsay. Upon investigation, Police Officer Mao Jinzhang of this branch bureau requested a long leave of absence on November 27th and left the bureau. It is likely that this is a misunderstanding based on hearsay from your newspaper. I am writing to request that this letter be published in the "Letters" column to clarify the facts. Respectfully yours, Kan Jizhou, Acting Director of the First Branch Bureau of the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Letter from Sun Hongyi: Respected Editor, I read in your newspaper on the 30th of last month a report about the establishment of the Tianjin Citizen Association, which listed my name, Hongyi, and designated me as a director, which caused me great astonishment. Hongyi has been recuperating in Shanghai, confined to my humble abode, and has barely left my house for nearly two years. I have not participated in any outside affairs and have never been involved in the so-called Tianjin Citizen Association. The report is far from the truth. I am writing to inform you of this and request a correction. Respectfully yours, Sun Hongyi, January 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e88">National Language Lecture: How to Write <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Ye Shaojun, Editor of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Fellow students: Today's topic is "How to Write." There are many books on this topic, some called "Composition Methods" or "Essentials of Grammar," which explain it in great detail. When a person picks up a pen to write, it would be ridiculous to constantly refer to these books and do everything according to what they say, just like a housewife holding a cooking lecture and making dishes at the same time. Most of these books summarize rules from existing articles and tell people how to write in accordance with the rules, and of course, they also explain how to write against the rules. With this knowledge, we have a measuring tool to look at general articles, not only knowing that an article is good, but also being able to say where an article is good, not only knowing that an article is bad, but also being able to say where an article is bad. Naturally, this knowledge can also affect our writing habits, but this influence is only between intentional and unintentional. On a certain point, it was originally often against the rules, but because of the knowledge of grammar, we realize our illegality. So, we pay special attention to change him over. This special attention may not be effective immediately. Perhaps in three times, twice it has been changed, and once it still commits the old problem. It must become a habit from special attention without deliberation, so that it can be in accordance with the rules every time. Therefore, books on grammar mainly help us to enhance our eyesight in reading articles, and enhancing our writing wrist strength is only an indirect help. I am not advising you not to read these books, but just saying that reading these books may not be able to write articles well. If you go to these books when it comes to writing, it is even more stupid and useless.</p>
<p>You all write vernacular now. The highest realm of vernacular is that the article is the same as the speaking. The sentences written on the paper, when read, are the sentences of spoken language, teaching people to read and listen, not only to completely understand the meaning in the article, but also to be able to comprehend the tone and spirit, as if listening to the person who wrote the article speaking in person. To achieve this realm, you cannot specialize in writing, but the most important thing is to forge our language habits. Because language is like the object itself, and the article is like a photo that leaves an image of the object. The object itself is complete and has a pattern, and the photo taken is of course complete and has a pattern. The language is thorough and has no problems. The article written according to the language is often thorough and has no problems. Therefore, forging language habits is a way to find the source. However, one sentence should be stated, and language habits should be forged. A person lives in a crowd, and there is a need to speak at any time and anywhere. If there are various shortcomings in language habits, there are also shortcomings in living skills, which is very disadvantageous. Practicing good language habits, at least, has a very important life skill. At the same time, this is the most reliable source for writing. How can we not work hard to forge it?</p>
<p>There are speaking subjects in elementary schools, and there are also organizations such as speech debate meetings. In middle schools, speeches and debates are also often held. These are all ways to forge language habits. When participating in this kind of gathering, we listen quietly to the language of the person who speaks, often with the following situations. After saying half a sentence, he shrunk back and changed to another sentence, which has nothing to do with the half sentence just now. This is one kind. "However," "however" in a series, "then" "then" a big pile, as usual, using one is enough, only because it takes time to prolong the time, waiting for the following words, only said a lot, this is one kind. The place that should be "however" is not "however", and the place that should be "then" is not "then." It is only because there seems to be a word needed in this place, but there is no alternative, so I randomly pull a word to make up the number. This is one kind. Some words sound very harsh. After careful identification, it turns out that there are several words in it that are not very appropriate, or they have used too many or too few words. This is another kind. A person who speaks like this must have very poor language habits at ordinary times, and never pays attention to forging it, so he reveals his weaknesses in the speech and debate meetings. If he teaches him to write articles, he will naturally write according to his own language habits, then his article must be more difficult for people to understand than his spoken language. Because when he speaks, his facial expressions and body postures are used as help. Relying on these helps, although the language is a little bit worse, it can still make people understand the general idea. When it is written as an article, the facial expressions and body postures cannot be written in. What people see is only some broken sentences that do not match the beginning and the end. How can people not be confused? Because of my job, I have many opportunities to read articles by middle school students, some of which are very outstanding, and some of which are very ugly, which is the so-called incomprehensible. The two words incomprehensible are too general. To be more specific, the meaning contained in these two words, in addition to the unsound and inappropriate materials, is the several problems mentioned above, that is, the shortcomings of language habits. If these students usually pay attention to the forging language habits, they can reduce a part of the incomprehensible when writing articles. Add to this the tempering of experience to make the writing materials sound and appropriate, and then it is completely clear. The so-called "clear" is originally not a state that is out of reach:</p>
<p>How should we start forging language habits? This is not difficult, but you must have perseverance and treat it as one thing at any time and place, just like correcting the posture of sitting and standing. You must sit upright and stand upright at any time and place to develop the habit of sitting upright and standing upright. We must limit ourselves, no matter when, not to say an incomplete sentence, say a sentence, we must express a meaning, so that people can understand it when they listen to it. We must limit ourselves, no matter when, not to use a word that we do not understand very well in the language, nor to force a word that is not very appropriate in the language, and when we say a sentence, every word must be very competent, like a skilled officer commanding his soldiers. We must also limit ourselves, no matter when, not to use a conjunction indiscriminately, not to use more or less an auxiliary word, and when we say a sentence, we must "however" only in the place where we should "however", and "then" only in the place where we should "then", and do not lack "ma" where we need "ma", and do not unnecessarily "le" where we do not need "le." This kind of forging seems very superficial and ridiculous, but it is the most basic. Parents should supervise young children, and elementary school teachers should supervise elementary school students, teaching them to do this kind of forging. Unfortunately, parents and elementary school teachers have not paid attention to this level, or they have paid attention to it but have not received the corresponding effect. For the sake of completing extremely important life skills, we have to pay attention to it ourselves. After paying attention to it for a considerable period of time, we must measure the effect. From extremely short simple sentences such as "I am reading" and "He has eaten", we cannot see it in these languages. We might as well try to say five minutes of continuous words and see if every sentence in this speech can follow the conditions we set ourselves. If we can, then our forging has been effective. At this point, it is not difficult to write articles. What should be said orally should be written in writing. Writing down the invisible language into a tangible article, who wouldn't do it as long as Chu will write? And the incomprehensible in writing will not happen, because the original is the language that is completely free of problems.</p>
<p>Listening to other people's language and reading other people's articles is also helpful for exercising language habits. When listening to other people's language, if you don't pay special attention, then understanding other people's meaning is enough, and it will not directly help to forge our language habits. We must pay special attention to how people choose words, how people express a meaning, and how people say a long language in order. After this, the inspection is all useful information for us. We can imitate the strengths of others, and we can avoid the shortcomings of others. Let's talk about reading other people's articles. There is one point that must be noted here, that is, the current articles, even those written by famous article writers, are not purely spoken language. It has only been a dozen years since writing vernacular, and everyone's skills have not been trained to a very skilled level. At the same time, the vocabulary of vernacular has not been publicly selected. For the sake of convenience, everyone often mixes some classical tones and vocabularies to become a kind of awkward style. But we just said that the highest realm of vernacular is that the article is the same as the speaking. Therefore, this kind of awkward style can only be regarded as a natural product of the transitional period, and cannot be regarded as a fully perfect standard model? If this point is clearly understood, we can avoid the bad influence of the current articles and read with a critical eye. If there are advantages, we should of course imitate them, and try to avoid the short points that are not very pure. If middle school students all over the country work hard in this way, not only can their language habits be forged very well, but also the style of vernacular can be accelerated to the most pure realm?

<h3 id="e89">Shanghai Circles: Local News: New Year's Day, the 25th Year of the Republic of China Celebrates the Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China: The Municipal Government and Its Affiliated Agencies Hold Group Greeting Ceremonies <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The New Year's Day of the 25th Year of the Republic of China is also the 25th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China. The Municipal Party Department of this city specially convened representatives from all walks of life at 10:00 AM at the Municipal Public Education Center to hold a commemorative meeting. The meeting was chaired by Lin Meiyan, a member of the Municipal Party Department. Firecrackers were set off before the meeting, and the meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participants: Lin Meiyan of the Municipal Party Department, China Commercial Art Writers Association, Zhao Zixiang, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Wang Zongjian, Association of Soy Sauce Manufacturers, Hu Xiangfu, China Medical College, Wang Guoping, Jiangsu Second High Court, Dong Chongshan, Fifth District Cotton Spinning Industry Association, Zhang Qingyun, Second Regiment of Military Police, Lu Hanmin, Sixth Regiment of the China Boy Scouts, Chen Zhizhen, Tongshen Cherishing Association, Cui Zisheng, Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sheng Yizhang, Shanghai Public Knowledge Guidance Association, Wang Longzhang, New Life Promotion Association, Hu Tianseng, Towing Industry Association, Chen Guifang, West Union Benefit Association, Zhuang Ping, and representatives from various district party departments and schools, totaling over five hundred people.</p>
<p>Raising the Flag and Setting Off Firecrackers</p>
<p>After all the representatives gathered, they were led by Boy Scouts and military police to the garden in front of the venue for the flag-raising ceremony and set off firecrackers. Then, the Boy Scouts of Guangzhao Middle School blew bugles, and Committee Member Lin Meiyan raised the national flag to the top of the flagpole, and everyone took off their hats to pay their respects. After the flag-raising ceremony, they returned to the venue to open the commemorative meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the ritual, Chairman Lin Meiyan reported, saying, in brief, that today is the first day of the 25th year of the Republic of China, and it is also the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All circles in this city are celebrating enthusiastically. The establishment of the Republic of China has brought about a great change for the future of the Chinese nation. Our country has undergone decades of autocratic rule, making the nation suffer under the high pressure of emperors and all feudal forces. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our party, created the Three Principles of the People and led compatriots across the country to engage in the National Revolution, overthrowing the Manchu Qing Dynasty in the Xinhai year and establishing the Republic of China. This, however, is only a section of the national revolution. The rulers who came after could not continue Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine and work hard, so the people's suffering has not been completely eliminated even after the founding of the Republic of China. Therefore, our party, under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, continued to struggle. Since the unification of China by our party's forces, despite the disturbances of the Red Bandits and the intensified pressure from foreign enemies, our party has followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to complete the National Revolution, so that all the people of the country can enjoy freedom and equality together. We should all rise up together, unite sincerely, and overcome this national crisis, establish a strong national foundation, and achieve the goal of world harmony.</p>
<p>Conference Slogans: New Year's Day is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China! Celebrate the founding of the Republic of China and complete the construction of political tutelage! Celebrate the founding of the Republic of China, and strive for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation! Commemorate the founding of the Republic of China, and unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression together! Commemorate the founding of the Republic of China, and implement the New Life Movement! Compatriots across the country, unite and revitalize the nation! Long live the Republic of China! Long live the Chinese Kuomintang!</p>
<p>Municipal Government Group Greeting: At 9:00 AM on New Year's Day, the Municipal Government held a group greeting ceremony. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Yi, Director of the Finance Bureau Cai Zengji, Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Peihuang, and all staff members of the Municipal Government and its affiliated bureaus and departments, secretaries, section chiefs, etc., gathered in the central city government auditorium.

<p>The League of Nations previously sent a circular to all member states, unanimously implementing an economic blockade against Italy. Our country, as a member of the League of Nations, has long complied and decided to implement a complete severance of Sino-Italian trade relations from the 2nd. All imported goods from Italy are prohibited from being picked up, and our country's export goods have been announced by the Jianghai Customs, prohibiting exports to Italy. This ban will only be lifted after a resolution by the League of Nations, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Central Mint Officially Starts Minting Copper-Nickel Subsidiary Coins from the 6th <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, after receiving orders to mint subsidiary coins, the Central Mint first had its Manufacturing Department Director cast several models, which were selected by the Ministry of Finance. Then, starting from December 20th of last year, they began trial minting of copper-nickel alloy subsidiary coins. These subsidiary coins are divided into six denominations: 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, 2 cents, and 1 cent. Currently, the mint is trial minting the 1-cent subsidiary coin. The composition and color have been carefully adjusted by the mint's engineers. The minted subsidiary coins have been sent to the Ministry of Finance for review. It is now known that after several inspections, all have been found to be qualified. Therefore, the mint has decided to officially start minting the six denominations of subsidiary coins from the 6th of this month. In the future, after the Ministry of Finance announces it, these subsidiary coins can be circulated and used in the market, it is said. The mint has added seven days of night shifts from the 25th of last month, rushing to produce mint bars, and the work is extremely busy. The quantity is very large and has been sufficient. Starting from January of the 25th year, silver coins will be minted. According to the mint's announcement, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the new legal currency system, the number of silver coins minted has reached more than 26 million yuan, all of which have been transported to the Central Bank to serve as reserves. In any case, it is sufficient to cope with scheduling and will not cause any panic. Therefore, there is currently no need to continue minting. However, types A and B of mint bars are frequently needed by various banks, so they are still being minted as usual, but the quantity is gradually reduced each month to meet the needs, it is said.</p>

The reasons for various industries in the country feeling difficulties are extremely complex, such as dumping of foreign goods, excessive taxation, or very promising industries that cannot develop due to lack of capital, or difficulties due to other various reasons. Those who have not personally experienced it cannot explain it in detail, and the government cannot consider the urgency and severity and provide relief. In accordance with the previous letter, we hereby send this letter to inform you that if there is a real need to request government relief, you should list the reasons for each difficulty and present the facts directly to the Ministry of Industries within the time limit.

<h3 id="e94">Tianli Anhydrous Ammonia Products Factory Grand Opening on New Year's Day Afternoon <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang Presided over the Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The Tianli Anhydrous Ammonia Products Factory held its grand opening ceremony at 3 p.m. on New Year's Day. Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang came to Shanghai from Nanjing to participate and delivered a speech. Various agencies of the municipal government also sent representatives to attend. The factory uses the latest type of machinery and utilizes natural raw materials to manufacture important industrial raw materials such as nitric acid, which is a highlight in the history of our country's industry. The grand occasion of the opening ceremony is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Decoration The factory is located in Zhoujiadu, Shanghai West. Inside the factory building, the four walls are covered with silk banners sent by various parties, and the Party and national flags and emblems are hung. Fresh flowers are placed in front of the podium, and colorful paper is wrapped around as a cable, which is exceptionally beautiful. Wu Yun-chu and his staff personally greeted the guests who attended the meeting, including Wu Dingchang, Fan Xudong, Li Zhaohuan, Zou Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, Xu Peihuang, Pan Yangyao, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunzhai, Li Dachao, Qian Chengxu, Guo Chengen, Ji Zejin, Wang Ertao, Qian Xinzhi, Wen Yuqing, Chen Zheqing, and more than 500 Chinese and foreign guests.</p>
<p>Releasing Balloons When the guests signed in, each was given a ticket to receive a balloon. The name and address were written on the ticket and tied under the balloon. At the balloon releasing place, the balloons were released to add to the fun. For a time, colorful balloons flew around, which was dazzling. However, the torrential rain inevitably spoiled the fun. The three large silver balloons set up by the factory could not be raised due to low air pressure. If anyone finds the balloons released by the guests and sends the tickets to the factory, they can get a gift, it is said.</p>
<p>Ceremony Order At 3 o'clock sharp, the ceremony began, in the following order: 1. Music; 2. All stand at attention; 3. Pay the highest respect to the Party and national flags and the portrait of the Premier; 4. Chairman Zhu Ziqian reads the Premier's will; 5. Silent tribute; 6. Chairman Zhu Ziqian delivers the opening speech; 7. Wu Yun-chu reports on the preparation process; 8. Minister Wu and Director Qian deliver speeches; 9. Representative speeches; 10. Factory representative delivers a reply; 11. Minister Wu performs the opening ceremony; 12. Tour the factory, take photos, tea, and the ceremony is completed.</p>
<p>Preparation Process After the ceremony, Chairman Zhu Ziqian delivered the opening speech, saying: "Today is the opening of the Tianli Anhydrous Ammonia Factory. We are extremely grateful to the government officials and guests from all parties for braving the rain to participate. All the creation and planning of our factory are presided over by Mr. Wu Yun-chu. Please ask Mr. Wu to report on the preparation process in detail." Then Mr. Wu reported: "Four years ago, the government planned to jointly run a sulfuric acid factory with a British and German company. The Ministry of Industries appointed personnel to start preparations. However, at that time, the plan was too grand and the equipment was too large, so it was difficult to complete. Therefore, after several negotiations, there was no result. In the 21st year of the Republic, the American DuPont Company intended to sell the synthetic ammonia factory in Seattle. I happened to be traveling in Europe and America, so I went to inspect it and saw that its machinery was good, so I started negotiations. The agreement was reached in November, and then shares were raised to establish the company. It was established in January of the 23rd year of the Republic. Later, the Ministry of Industries ran its own sulfuric acid factory. In order to divide the work and cooperate, our factory focused on the manufacture of nitric acid. In July, I went to Europe again to inspect the machinery ordered and investigate the progress of nitric acid manufacturing methods. I returned to China in October and actively installed it. In August of the 24th year of the Republic, anhydrous ammonia was produced. In September, dilute nitric acid was produced. In October, concentrated nitric acid was produced. In November, the sulfuric acid concentration device was completed. The engineering part has come to an end. Today, I am honored to have you all here, and I hope to receive your guidance."</p>
<p>Ministerial Speech Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang gave a speech, saying: "It is very meaningful to participate in the opening ceremony of the Tianli Anhydrous Ammonia Factory on New Year's Day of the 25th year of the Republic. In the past ten years, our country has gradually developed in applied chemistry and chemical industry, which is a good phenomenon for the country. There is Mr. Fan Xudong in the north and Mr. Wu Yun-chu in the south among the domestic chemists. These two gentlemen are the leaders of our country's chemical industry, and almost everyone knows it. The gradual progress of our country's chemical industry should be given twelve points of respect to the two gentlemen. In the recent decades, the domestic economy has declined. Not only is it difficult to establish new factories, but also the old factories have failed one after another. The establishment of this new factory today is thought to be a sign of industrial turning point. Its development and prosperity are not only the glory of Mr. Wu's personal, but also the glory of the industrial community and the government and people. In the past, most of the factories built large houses first, which consumed most of the capital. The Tianli Factory seeks the perfection of machinery and equipment with almost all the capital. Its success can be expected, and its founding spirit can be a model for the Chinese people to run factories."</p>
<p>Guest Speeches Deputy Minister of Education Qian Changzhao said, "Anhydrous ammonia has a close relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihood. Our country's chemical industry is still in its infancy. The success of this Tianli Factory is something we can be happy about. The success of the Tianli Factory is the result of Mr. Wu's decades of hard work. Mr. Wu initially researched monosodium glutamate and obtained good results with a very small amount of capital. Its products are better than foreign products, but Mr. Wu is not satisfied with this. He also founded the Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, and then established the Anhydrous Ammonia Factory today. His enterprising spirit is worthy of our admiration. This is one of the reasons. Starting with small-scale factories and then gradually seeking development. This is the second. In terms of technology, from simple to complex. This is the third. With these three characteristics, there are more successes and fewer failures. Moreover, in this recession, it was resolutely established, which can give the domestic industrialists unlimited courage. As for protection, encouragement and maintenance, the country and society should jointly bear the responsibility." Then Mayor Wu's representative Xu Peihuang, the representative of the National Federation of Industrial Unions Qian Chengxu, and others gave speeches. The speeches were omitted. Finally, Mr. Wu gave a thank-you speech, saying: "I am grateful to everyone for participating today, and I am also grateful to Minister Wu and others for their praise. I will work harder to meet your expectations. However, starting a business is not easy, and there are many difficulties. I hope that all sectors will guide me at any time." Then Minister Wu performed the opening ceremony. In the sound of long whistles, the ceremony was completed. The guests were led into the factory for a tour and then dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Bank Association Stops Announcing Exchange Rates from Yesterday; Domestic Exchange Rates Balanced After Legal Tender Implementation; Foreign Exchange Measures Implemented Yesterday; Exchange Rates Concentrated in the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association, the banks of the Banking Reserve Committee, and the clearing houses, etc., opened for business yesterday. Measures to stabilize foreign exchange were implemented yesterday. Foreign exchange has been concentrated in the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. The Market Committee of the Banking Association has stopped meeting and announcing exchange rates. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Stabilizing Foreign Exchange Measures Implemented After the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications conducted unlimited buying and selling of foreign exchange, and in order to stabilize foreign exchange, detailed measures were formulated. Foreign exchange purchased, before delivery, its funds existing in foreign banks can also be used as cash for issuance reserves. This has been implemented since yesterday. At the same time, the provisions of Article 4 of the Inspection Regulations of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee announced by the Ministry of Finance stipulate that "the cash reserve for legal tender issuance shall be 60%, which shall be filled with gold, silver or foreign exchange."</p>
<p>Fixed Exchange Rates for Foreign Exchange After the three banks made every effort to stabilize foreign exchange, the daily exchange rate for telegraphic transfer announced by the Central Bank is still in accordance with the standard amount. Yesterday's exchange rate was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence per yuan for London, 29.75 US dollars per 100 yuan for New York, 451 francs per 100 yuan for Paris, 73.75 marks per 100 yuan for Berlin, 103 yen per 100 yuan for Japan, and 94 Hong Kong dollars per 100 yuan for Hong Kong. In addition, the Foreign Exchange Parity Committee announced a balance tax rate of 1.325%.</p>
<p>Market Committee Stops Meeting In order to unify the business operations of the banks in the association, the Banking Association organized the Market Committee in accordance with the bill of October 8, 1920, with the purpose of unifying the market and jointly observing it. The members are Chen Zheqing, Zhang Peishen, Wang Yansong, etc. Each bank sends a representative to gather at the association at 9:00 am every day to discuss and decide on various domestic and foreign market prices. Now, since the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender, domestic exchange rates have been balanced, and foreign exchange is handled by the three banks. After the committee's resolution, it will stop announcing market prices by the association from this year, and the seventh article of the business rules, "The exchange rate of domestic and foreign exchange of domestic currency shall be determined and announced by the association every day," has been completely deleted. The market meeting at 9:00 am yesterday has been stopped.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Transactions Concentrated in Three Banks In addition to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, there are also Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai Kenye, Siming, Continental, National Products, etc., among the Chinese-owned banks that operate foreign exchange. However, since the three banks are required to buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction, if there are foreign exchange transactions, they must be settled in accordance with the foreign exchange rate announced by the Central Bank, only earning commissions, so foreign exchange transactions have almost been concentrated in the three banks. At the same time, foreign banks such as Citibank, Mercantile Bank, HSBC, Banque de l'Indochine, Mitsui, Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, etc., are also limiting the purchase and sale of foreign exchange because there is no profit to be made. The member banks of the Banking Association, the banks of the Banking Reserve Committee, and the clearing houses, etc., opened for business yesterday. As for the amount of surplus of each bank, it will be announced after being collected by the Banking Association. In the future, all business will be suspended all day every Sunday. The new member banks of the Banking Association, Sichuan Meifeng, China Agricultural and Industrial, Zhejiang Local, Jiangsu Farmers, Yongda, and Pudong, etc., have all joined the clearing house. Yesterday's total exchange was 17,767,775.09 yuan.</p>
<p>Qian Industry is Ready for Complete Closure After the Qian Industry Association member qian shops and qian industry reserve banks and qian industry markets opened the day before yesterday, the decision was made to set January 23 as the final closure date for the 24th year, which is coming soon. All preparations have been made. For all customers, the settlement will be made on January 15, and statements will be issued. From January 19, the time for receiving tickets will be extended to 4:00 pm, and the return of tickets will be extended by one hour. Yesterday, the intraday interest rate in the Qian Industry Market was 9 points in both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Railway's Reduced Prices for Grain Transportation Continued for Another Year <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The special price for grain transportation on the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which was reduced by the fifth grade, expired on January 31. The Railway Bureau's Transportation Department believed that although the transportation volume of this special price has recovered to its previous state in January to June of last year, in order to alleviate the rural decline, it is proposed to continue it. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways, Instruction No. 148, approved from January 1, 25th year</p>
<h3 id="e97">Silk Exports Increased Sharply in the Past Eleven Months, But Imports of Rayon Also Increased <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, silk exports in the past eleven months were worth more than 34,467,000 yuan, ranking second among all exports, only slightly less than tung oil by a hundred thousand yuan. The reason is that the American recovery movement has been effective, requiring a large amount of silk. The types of silk exported are as follows: Tonggong silk 491,893 yuan, white silk 512,178 yuan, white silk warp 1,273,428 yuan, white filature silk 22,023,428 yuan, grey filature silk 702,017 yuan, grey silk 4,610 yuan, yellow silk 368,888 yuan, yellow silk warp 33,976 yuan, yellow filature silk 1,867,871 yuan, waste silk 3,906,858 yuan, clothing 246,028 yuan, and silk waste cotton 7,739 yuan. The recovery of silk exports to second place is a good phenomenon in foreign trade last year. However, at the same time, imports of rayon have also increased sharply compared with before. In the past eleven months, rayon imports totaled 3,685,210 customs gold units, worth 6,660,898 yuan, an increase of more than 800,000 yuan compared with the import volume of 5,809,787 yuan in the same period of the previous year. The country with the most imports is Japan, worth 1,725,495 customs gold units. The second is Italy, worth 1,713,684 customs gold units, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Municipal National Products Year Sports Meet Urges the Use of National Products; Yesterday's Telegram to the Whole Country <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal National Products Year Sports Meet, since its opening, specially telegraphed the whole country yesterday to unanimously use domestic products in order to promote the love of domestic products among the Chinese people. The original text says, (omitted above) The National Products Year has passed, followed by the Women's National Products Year. The Women's National Products Year has passed, followed by the Students' National Products Year. The Students' National Products Year has passed, and this year is officially designated as the Municipal National Products Year. The long continuation of this history of the National Products Movement makes us painfully realize that the effectiveness of the National Products Movement in recent years has only reached the external appearance of the national economy and has not yet penetrated into its inner layers. Therefore, if we want the full effect of the National Products Movement to be realized, we must rely on the continued efforts of our compatriots across the country. We pray that our compatriots across the country will pay close attention. In today's world, when hegemony is rampant and the world's economic panic has reached its peak, it is inevitable that imperialism will tightly seize the colonial market as the last colonial countries suffer even more cruel encounters. Since September 18, our country has lost its rights and territories, and the entire national economy has suffered from the poison of the dumping policies of the great powers and has fallen into an irrecoverable situation. This harsh fact clearly shows us that there is no other way to save the country except to promote domestic products and preserve the remaining economic lifeline. We further pray that our compatriots across the country will pay close attention. Imperialism's aggression against colonial countries must take two forms: one is the threat of force, and the other is economic exploitation. Attacking cities and seizing land or imposing various unequal treaties belongs to the former, and dumping goods and exploiting the blood of the colonial people belongs to the latter. Our country's current situation is undoubtedly trapped under the double attack of these two aggressions. Our compatriots across the country have all deeply regretted the humiliation and shame that our national army has failed to resist the unlimited aggression of the enemy troops in recent years. But we should also think that we have failed to isolate ourselves from foreign goods, and our daily lives are still surrounded by foreign goods, and we have not resisted them, which is also a humiliation and shame. Furthermore, our compatriots across the country all hate the treacherous merchants who are greedy for profit and forget their righteousness. But we should also think that we have failed to reject foreign goods and not use them, or we are accustomed to fashion and regard the use of imported goods as noble and beautiful, resulting in huge trade deficits and burying national interests. Asking ourselves, is it the same crime as the treacherous merchants? Compatriots, the national crisis is so serious that we can no longer be indecisive. We should quickly wake up, resolve to reject foreign goods, step onto the front line of the National Products Movement, and be a warrior in the national economic struggle. Promoting domestic products is the only way to save the country and survive, as mentioned above. Now, what we want to examine more is why the National Products Movement has failed in the past, and how should we promote it in the future to avoid repeating the same mistakes? Indeed, the exploitative desire of imperialism is difficult to fill, and the blood of the Chinese people has only the last drop left. Therefore, we must make the greatest efforts to open up the future for this newly born Municipal National Products Year. Examining the goals of the National Products Movement, we must not only ensure that everyone uses domestic products, but also that everyone has good domestic products to use and cheap domestic products to use. Therefore, we have determined the three principles of the National Products Movement to be the guidelines for our work: First, promote the psychological construction of the National Products Movement. This is to use the power of propaganda to stimulate the patriotic psychology of the 400 million compatriots and arouse the enthusiasm of everyone to use domestic products. For this, we will adopt various methods such as publishing, lecturing, and broadcasting to expand the promotion and introduction of domestic products. Second, promote the social construction of the National Products Movement. This is to change the social fashion of worshiping foreign goods and eliminate the traces of unscrupulous merchants. For this, we will hold various national product exhibitions and pavilions so that the public has the opportunity to recognize, purchase, and criticize national products, and strictly implement investigations and inspections to report and study them. Third, promote the material construction of the National Products Movement. This is to ensure that there are good domestic products and cheap domestic products to meet the needs of compatriots across the country. For this, we will ask the government to encourage livelihoods and remove all chains that bind domestic products, seek the development of transportation to facilitate the collection of raw materials and the transportation of manufactured goods, and contact various national product factories to improve manufacturing and reduce profits to alleviate the burden on users. This psychological, social, and material construction of the National Products Movement is the cornerstone of the national economy and the foundation of national rejuvenation. However, due to the arduous and complex nature of the work, in addition to our urban citizens who should focus on the central mobilization in name and in fact, we also hope that compatriots across the country will work together with one heart, rise up together, and with a calm and persevering spirit, bravely advance toward the path of "national products save the country."</p>

<p>The late Mr. Wu Tingsheng, former chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Tobacco Industry Association, had been involved in the tobacco business for forty years, holding a leading position in the industry. In 1932, recognizing the increasing volume of imported tobacco leaves and the significant revenue leakage, he gathered Chinese capital to establish the Xuchang Tobacco Leaf Co., Ltd., aiming for cooperation in production, sales, and transportation. In 1934, he proposed a plan to improve American tobacco varieties to the Ministry of Finance. Minister Kong deeply praised his efforts, and in July of that year, a declaration was issued, allocating 50,000 yuan from funds for assisting in anti-smuggling and improving tobacco leaves to establish the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee under the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance. Mr. Wu was appointed as a full-time member to take charge of the project. For improving tobacco leaves, Mr. Wu established cultivation fields and distributed American tobacco seeds and temperature charts to farmers, meticulously planning various improvement measures, which have yielded positive results. Regarding the purchase and sale of tobacco leaves, he not only strived for cooperation in production, sales, and transportation but also paid attention to the supply and demand of tobacco leaves and the prevention of illicit tobacco. In addition, he devised and implemented practical measures to promote benefits and eliminate malpractices, such as cracking down on weight overages, mixed bundles, and mixed packaging, and standardizing silver exchange rates, and reported them to the Ministry of Finance for record-keeping to ensure the tobacco leaf trade was conducted fairly. Both merchants and farmers benefited, and local farmers deeply respected him. However, Mr. Wu's impartial handling of matters, regardless of hardship and complaints, greatly inconvenienced those who sought personal gain, and they harbored resentment, plotting to harm him. On the afternoon of December 30th of the previous year, at 3:00 PM, they instigated thugs to ambush him at the gate of Xuchang, and Mr. Wu was unfortunately assassinated. Those who heard the news from afar were deeply saddened. When the tragic news reached Shanghai, Mr. Wu's fellow villagers, relatives, and friends were extremely indignant. The Ministry of Finance, the Taxation Administration, the Ningbo and Fenghua Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Associations, the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee of the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, the Anti-Smuggling Assistance Committee, the Tobacco Business Committee, and Mr. Wu's family have separately telegraphed President Chiang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, requesting a thorough investigation and arrest of the mastermind and accomplices to uphold the law and console the deceased. Excerpts of the telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Taxation Administration Urgent, Addressed to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: According to a telegram from the Tobacco Business Committee, the family of Chairman Wu Tingsheng reported that he was assassinated in Xuchang West Street while on duty, which is extremely tragic. Please forward this request for the arrest of the culprits to console the deceased. Chairman Wu has been enthusiastic about committee affairs and spared no effort. He has been particularly diligent in assisting anti-smuggling and improving tobacco leaves, breaking through personal connections and handling matters impartially. However, villains have harbored resentment and taken the opportunity to attack, which is extremely unlawful. Please promptly forward this to the Ministry of Finance and telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to order the arrest of the culprits and bring them to justice. Furthermore, the Anti-Smuggling Assistance Committee, the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee, and Mr. Wu's family have sent telegrams with similar requests. Adviser Wu Tingsheng has assisted in anti-smuggling and improved tobacco leaves for years, not avoiding hardship and complaints, and has devoted himself to the work, increasing public revenue and improving the tobacco business with considerable success. However, he was suddenly attacked and killed, which is truly regrettable. In light of the above, it is proposed that you promptly telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to order the arrest of the culprits within a time limit and bring them to justice to uphold the law and order. Respectfully submitted, Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Administration, sealed.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Ningbo Fellow Villagers' Association Addressed to President Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: We were shocked and outraged to hear the news report that Mr. Wu Tingsheng was assassinated in Xuchang. We request that you telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to order the arrest of the culprits within a time limit and bring them to justice to console the deceased and punish the lawbreakers. Respectfully submitted, Yu Hede and others of the Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Association of Ningbo.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Fenghua Fellow Villagers' Association Addressed to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Capital, our esteemed fellow villager: Your Excellency has made great contributions to the Party and the nation, striving for production and construction, which is admired by all. Mr. Wu Tingsheng, a fellow villager, has always supported the Party and the nation, serving the public interest. For the development of national tobacco, he has been diligent and enterprising. In recent years, he has upheld your intentions and carried out the orders of the Ministry of Finance, first improving tobacco varieties and regulating the market in Xuchang, benefiting hundreds of thousands of farmers, increasing production by more than ten million yuan annually, significantly increasing tax revenue, and reducing foreign tobacco imports. However, those who sought personal gain disregarded national production and the livelihood of farmers, initially designing obstructions, then confusing right and wrong, and even instigating thugs to inflict death. They have disregarded the law and order to the extreme, and national power has been weakened, and production has been damaged, which is unforgivable. We earnestly request that you protect the progress of production and construction and exercise the justice of eliminating violence and ensuring peace, promptly ordering the arrest of the culprits and investigating the masterminds so that Mr. Wu Tingsheng's principles may be made clear, and his grievances may be redressed. The entire Shanghai Fellow Villagers' Association is deeply grateful and awaits your instructions urgently. Respectfully submitted, Fenghua Fellow Villagers' Association.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Family Addressed to Director Wu of the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance: We have just received a telegram from our relative, Mr. Ding Ruilin, from Xuchang, stating that Mr. Wu Tingsheng was assassinated in Xuchang at 6:00 PM on December 30th. Our late father was murdered while on duty, which is extremely tragic. We humbly request that you forward this to the Ministry of Finance and telegraph the Henan Provincial Government to order the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District stationed in Xuchang to arrest the culprits within a time limit and bring them to justice to console the loyal soul. With tears, we humbly beg for your consideration. Urgently submitted, Wu Shenxiong, Shenkun, Shenpeng, Shenhu, and others, weeping.</p>
<p>Telegram from the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association Addressed to President Chiang of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: President Chiang of the Executive Yuan, Nanjing: Our former chairman, Mr. Wu Tingsheng, was a respected elder with decades of experience in Shanghai, where he achieved considerable success in business and supported public welfare, earning the respect of society. Recently, he upheld the state's policy of promoting production and construction, carrying out the Ministry of Finance's order to improve tobacco varieties in Xuchang, Henan, in the original tobacco-producing area. Since the improvement, there has been success, not only has foreign imports sharply decreased, but also production has greatly increased, and tax revenue has gradually become abundant, and the beneficiaries are no less than tens of millions of farmers. Unexpectedly, a few villains, harboring evil intentions, intentionally sabotaged, causing Mr. Wu to be tragically assassinated before completing his meritorious work. Thinking of this, we are deeply saddened. We believe that eliminating violence and ensuring peace is a constant principle of the state, and we hope that loyal and virtuous people can be rewarded and encouraged, and that traitors and villains cannot escape punishment. Our association cherishes his past contributions and mourns the loss of a capable person for the state and society. Therefore, we especially request that you promptly order the local officials to strictly arrest the ringleaders and clearly execute them to console the loyal soul and uphold the law. We await your instructions with the utmost urgency.</p>

<p>Mr. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and all the directors and supervisors have decided three times to submit their resignations to the government. Mr. Liu has not been to the bureau for a long time, and important matters are handled by telephone consultation.

<h3 id="e103">The Jiangxin Steamer and the Yunlong Steamer Collided in the Middle of the River Yesterday; The Jiangxin Was More Severely Damaged but Can Still Manage to Sail to Shanghai <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangxin, a first-class steamer of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has a deadweight of 3,375 tons, a registered tonnage of 2,101 tons, a length of 340 feet, a width of 47 feet, a draft of 12 feet 6 inches, a horsepower of 2,200, and three decks. It left Hankou fully loaded with cargo and passengers on the night of the 3rd of this month to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning (the 4th), it was hit and damaged while traveling through Huangshi Port.</p>
<p>Collision En Route In recent days, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been decreasing daily, and there has been fog on the river surface. The Jiangxin was proceeding in Huangshi Port when the Yunlong steamer of the Heng'an Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 1,777 tons, was traveling from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Hankou. When it reached Huangshi Port and met the Jiangxin, the pilot was careless due to the shallow water and fog, resulting in a collision with the Jiangxin. Mr. Xu Bin, the captain of the Jiangxin, tried to retreat urgently, but it was too late, resulting in the collision and the accident.</p>
<p>Damage Situation After the accident, the captain of the Jiangxin immediately sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai to report to the head office. The telegram was very brief, stating that the ship was collided with by the Yunlong in the waters of Huangshi Port, and the hull on the starboard side, the railings and guardrails on the deck, and the cabins were damaged. Fortunately, it was above the waterline and did not affect navigation, and it could still sail to Shanghai. The Yunlong was also slightly damaged. The cause of the accident and the detailed situation are still awaiting further reports. Yesterday afternoon, the bureau received the telegram and found that the information was not detailed enough to understand the truth. In addition to sending a telegram to the captain of the ship for further inquiry, it first sent the received telegram to the insurance company for review. On the one hand, because the Jiangxin could arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, and today is Sunday, it was decided to wait until the ship arrives in Shanghai before inquiring the captain and sending technicians on board to inspect the ship, and then repair the damaged parts in the dock.</p>

<p>Hengshan The Hengshan, a Yangtze River steamer of the Sanbei Company, has a deadweight of 1,922 tons and a length of 262 feet. The company received a telegram from its captain, Tao Jiexun Targersen, yesterday, stating that the ship ran aground downstream of Jiujiang at 4:00 PM on the 2nd of this month due to the sharp decline in river water. The ship was fully loaded with cargo and had a draft of 16 feet, so it could not move after running aground. The captain telegraphed Shanghai for help. The Qingpu steamer, which departed from Shanghai to Hankou at the end of last month, passed through Jiujiang on the 3rd, and the company telegraphed it to rescue the Hengshan. The Qingpu towed from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 3rd, but failed to rescue the Hengshan because it was stuck in the sand. The company was deeply concerned that the water level would continue to decline, making it difficult to rescue the ship. Yesterday afternoon, it urgently telegraphed the Jiujiang branch to send barges to unload the cargo from the ship before towing it.</p>
<p>Baofeng The Baofeng, a ship of the Jufeng Baoji Shipping Company, ran aground on the 1st of this month south of Songjigang after departing from Shanghai at 2:05 AM due to fog. The captain, Xue Jinlong, immediately tried to reverse the engine to escape, but the right propeller of the engine was damaged. It managed to retreat from the shoal at 3:10 AM. Yesterday, the Baofeng barely sailed back to Shanghai and reported to the company and the insurance company, preparing for repairs and the installation of a new propeller.</p>
<p>Oil Tanker A Sanbei Company oil barge ran aground above Yuezhou due to the falling water level. The barge is now surrounded by water and is almost on the beach. The Changsha branch sent a ship to rescue it, but it could not get close. The Shanghai bureau telegraphed the Hunan branch to send a large number of workers to dig and divert the river water to the bottom of the ship, hoping to tow it out of the shoal.</p>
<p>Wusong The Wusong, a Yangtze River ship of the British Taikoo Company, departed from Shanghai on the night of the 2nd of this month, fully loaded with cargo and passengers, heading for Hankou. Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram stating that the ship ran aground near Jiangyin due to the falling river water and excessive load and could not move. The company has received the report and is planning towing and rescue procedures.</p>

However, many of the colleagues in the office are former colleagues, and we can gather together happily in the future. We can study and discuss the office affairs with each other, and we can naturally make up for my shortcomings. Today, I am here to take office, and I am glad to be celebrating the New Year. In addition to my joy, I would like to wish everyone progress. Also, when the minister took office, I participated in the ceremony and heard the minister's instructions. I would like to summarize them and report them to you as a compass for our future work: We must personally practice the new life, take it as a guideline, and emphasize physical health. Only with a strong physique can we be competent for arduous work. We must observe order and make office work regular and orderly. We must adhere to neat and solemn rules. We must cooperate and divide labor. All public affairs should be without division and should be assisted by each other, and the spirit of mutual assistance should be fully developed to increase the efficiency of office work. I hope to encourage everyone to pay attention to these points. As for the scope of work of this office and the outline of work, the minister has stipulated them in great detail, and I believe that everyone is aware of them, so I will not repeat them."</p>

<p>The Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Headquarters, located in Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road in this city, was approved by the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Interior and was established on November 20th of last year. It officially opened on New Year's Day this year (the opening ceremony was held at 3:00 PM that afternoon in the headquarters' auditorium, presided over by Zhang Zilian, chairman of the headquarters' management committee. Pan Gongzhan, a member of the Central Committee specially dispatched by the Central Propaganda Department and the Director of Education of this city, Lu Xirong, the Director of Rites and Customs of the Ministry of Interior, Lin Yannan dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Lu Jingshi dispatched by the Municipal Party Headquarters, attended the bureau to deliver speeches on behalf of the government. Attendees included Chen Qicai, the Director of the Budget Office, Liu Derong, a special commissioner stationed at the bureau by the Central Propaganda Department, Li An, a special commissioner stationed at the bureau by the Ministry of Interior, and leaders from all walks of life such as Du Yuesheng, Shen Tianxin, Zhao Xichen, and Shen Zhongyi, totaling more than 300 people. Changrong Chu and Chi Tingxian, standing committee members of the bureau, and committee members Yu Zhendong, Deng Zhonghe, Weng Shou Xuan, Chen Zhibei, and Shen Chuchen were responsible for the reception. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech Chairman Zhang Zilian delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today is the opening day of our headquarters. We are deeply honored to have representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Interior, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Municipal Party Headquarters to deliver speeches, as well as distinguished figures from all walks of life to attend and provide guidance. The Party and National Flag is a symbol of the nation and the country, created by revolutionary martyrs who shed their blood to build the nation. Its colors and patterns symbolize the Three Principles of the People and the national spirit of peace and struggle. Before the establishment of this headquarters, which was approved by the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, the unified Party and National Flag movement was initiated by my request and approved and commended by Chairman Chiang. After the painstaking planning of the Party and government agencies, this headquarters was established. From now on, the colleagues of this headquarters should strive to fulfill the duties of a national citizen, promote and publicize the Party and National Flag, promote the national spirit, and devote ourselves to the national revival movement to live up to the expectations of the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Interior, and compatriots from all walks of life."</p>
<p>Representative's Speech Pan Gongzhan, the representative of the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, saying, "The definition of a country has certain regulations in political science and law, but the symbol that represents the life and all the purposes of the country is the national flag. Our country builds the nation with the Party. Dr. Sun Yat-sen led the revolution with the Three Principles of the People. Since the Xingzhonghui and Tongmenghui to the Kuomintang, the history of the Republic of China has been deeply related to the Party. Now that the constitutional government has not yet been implemented, the Kuomintang is the highest leader in all aspects of national politics, so the Blue Sky with a White Sun Party flag should be respected together with the national flag. In the past, the size of the Party and National Flag did not meet the proportions, and the colors did not follow the prescribed standards, which was not conducive to showing neatness and magnificence. Therefore, there must be a unified method. The Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Headquarters, under the leadership of Party and government agencies, is different from ordinary businesses and should assist the government in promoting the Party and National Flag. At this time of national crisis, we should pay attention to the promotion of the Party and National Flag to test the people's faith in the Party and the country. If all the compatriots in the country have the heart to support the Party and the country, the revival of the Chinese nation will not be difficult." Lu Xirong, the representative of the Ministry of Interior and the Director of Rites and Customs, delivered a speech, saying, "The Party and National Flag is a symbol and spiritual representation of the entire nation and country, which is of great importance in international perception. At this time when the entire nation is striving to revive the national movement, we should pay special attention to the Party and National Flag, which symbolizes the entire nation and country, and strive for neatness and uniformity. The Ministry of Interior has repeatedly issued regulations on the manufacturing and use of the Party and National Flag and the management of Party and National Flag manufacturing and sales stores in accordance with the instructions of the central government. However, flag merchants in various places are mostly small-capital operations, making it difficult to achieve uniformity. The Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Headquarters was established after the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and the China Flag Manufacturing Company were approved to merge. The equipment and scale are sufficient to undertake the task of unifying the flag system and selling it throughout the country. Under the guidance and supervision of the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, it will be able to improve and achieve perfection." Lu Jingshi, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, then delivered a speech with many words of encouragement. Chen Gongcai, the Director of the Budget Office, and Du Yuesheng and other leaders from all walks of life in this city also delivered speeches. Liu Derong, a special commissioner of the Central Propaganda Department, stated the importance that the Central Party Headquarters attached to the Party and National Flag, the methods and approvals prescribed by previous meetings, and the establishment of the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Headquarters by the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company and the China Flag Manufacturing Company. Chairman Zhang Zilian then delivered a speech of thanks.</p>
<p>Reception for All Walks of Life After the ceremony, the headquarters hosted a banquet at the Jinlong Hotel to entertain the representatives of the Central Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Interior, as well as all walks of life in this city. All the committee members attended the reception, which was very grand for a while.</p>

He then praised the late French Ambassador to China, Wilden, and his successor, Nagy, for their contributions to the French nationals in China. He then raised a toast, played the Marseillaise, and everyone dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>Mr. Ho Fu, the liquidator of the American Oriental Banking Corporation, recently decided to pay 7.5% of the debts owed by the bank to various accounts. All checks have been issued and sent to the accounts, but one-third of the original letters were returned by the post office due to unknown addresses. Mr. Ho Fu claims that the addresses written are all in accordance with the registered addresses in the books and are not wrong. It is likely that the accounts have moved and have not reported the changes to the bank.

This case is the most sensational one handled by the U.S. Court for China since the 1927 case in which District Attorney Mr. Hussa was accused of accepting bribes. Therefore, the audience was packed yesterday. The defendant, Mr. Raye, was represented by Tianjin lawyer Mr. Evans, while Mr. Blanc was represented by lawyers Mr. Fackling and Mr. Watson. After the court opened, Dr. Slater stated the main points of the charges against the defendants. Subsequently, Mr. Evans refuted them in a few words and formally declared the defendant not guilty. This case involves a wide range. According to Dr. Slater, the witnesses to be summoned in the future will be divided into five major categories for separate trials.

Therefore, it is scheduled to start work uniformly on the 5th of this month (today), and it is expected that all will be completed around May.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Number of Flood Victims in Shandong Province Reaches Over 2 Million <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association for Raising Funds for Flood Relief in Various Provinces received a letter from the Shandong Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, stating that on July 10th this year, the Dongzhuang Linpu Collection in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province breached, flooding more than ten counties including Juancheng. Fields, houses, and grains were all swept away, and the mainland became a watery country, turning farmers into flood victims. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in decades. Fortunately, the Shandong provincial government has been providing emergency relief while ordering various cities and counties to set up shelters. A total of 88 cities and counties have set up shelters, accommodating a total of 345,475 people, including the elderly and weak in the disaster area. In addition, in the ten disaster-stricken counties, at least 1.8 million people are without clothing or food and are registered for relief. The committee has already reported the situation by telegram in October. Currently, the floodwaters in the disaster area have not yet receded, and there is no hope for planting wheat, and there is no guarantee for spring plowing. In the long run, the flood victims in the shelters are provided with food, but their return date is uncertain. Those registered for relief are crying out all day long and have no means of livelihood. Moreover, it is deep winter, and clothing for warmth is especially needed. The tragic situation of the disaster has reached its extreme. The committee is responsible for relief and is undeniably obligated, but the relief funds depend entirely on the government and various charitable organizations and benevolent people for continuous support, working together to provide assistance. Now, the list of 345,475 flood victims sheltered in various cities and counties, and the 1,996,958 flood victims registered for relief in the ten disaster-stricken counties has been compiled. You are requested to check and assist the association, and please forward it to various charitable organizations. Thank you. Furthermore, the five counties of Zou, Teng, Wen, Shouzhang, and Yanggu have also been affected by the Yellow River breach, and the disaster situation is severe. Funds have been allocated for separate relief efforts. As for the number of flood victims, the order to investigate has not yet been returned, and it will be announced later. This is attached for your information. The disaster situation in various provinces this year, such as that in Shandong Province, covers as many as nine provinces, and the urgency of relief has increased rather than decreased. It is hoped that the entire country will rise up to provide emergency relief in order to achieve results.</p>

<p>The fundraising group of the Flood Relief Association, in order to plead for the victims in various places, has requested donations from all walks of life to provide relief. Mr. Wang Lan of the Xiangzu Painting and Calligraphy Society, which travels across the country in this city, recognizing the severity of the disaster situation this year and the urgent need for relief for the victims, specifically donated more than 500 paintings and calligraphies from the society. The funds from the sale of tickets will be used to免振欵. After consideration by the deputy director of the fundraising group of the Flood Relief Association, Mr. Li Dachao, he immediately expressed his approval of Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for disaster relief. Therefore, an exhibition was held at the Public Education Hall on Wenmiao Road a few days ago. The number of visitors every day was no less than a thousand. Because of its rich content and exquisite mounting, it was praised by all walks of life. It is now known that this exhibition closed the day before yesterday. According to the person in charge of the association, the painting and calligraphy exhibition was only held for a few days. As the aim was to aid disaster relief, it was enthusiastically supported by all walks of life, so the results were considered excellent. However, as there are still some who have not been able to collect their items on time, the association specially抽件 on-site at the closing ceremony and has sent people to deliver them in batches, with the aim of transferring the proceeds from the tickets to relief funds to benefit the flood victims.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Xinzha Branch: Cracking Down on Counterfeit Currency Manufacturing Organization: Ten Male and Female Criminals Arrested: Over 20,000 in Counterfeit Currency Seized: Two Machines and Many Parts <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 10:00 AM on the 31st of last month, the Zhongyu Road Police Station of the Zhabei Xinzha Branch cracked down on a counterfeit currency manufacturing organization in the stove room at No. 38 Yuqing Lane, Xinyu Road, Qiujiang Road, and arrested a total of ten male and female suspects, including printing workers and apprentices. 12,000 yuan of single-sided counterfeit banknotes of the Chinese Farmers Bank that had been printed, 10,000 yuan of counterfeit banknotes in the initial version, and two machines were seized. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Superficial Details of the Organization: The location is at No. 38 Yuqing Lane (i.e., the first lane on the left south of Xinyu Road) on Qiujiang Road. It is a single-opening Japanese-style house, facing south from the north. Usually, people enter and exit from Xinyu Road in Yuqing Lane. The back door is directly connected to the municipal house on Qiujiang Road, with only a small lane in between. No one enters or exits, so it is locked all year round. In front of this house, in the living room, there is an Jiangxingji Machinery Factory, with many rusty old machines and rusty iron all over the ground. Therefore, the neighbors on the left and right do not go to see it, so no one knows that there is a counterfeit currency manufacturing organization.</p>
<p>Accidental Crackdown: Last month, the 31st was the last day for forced registration of opium smokers, so Inspector Xie Zhongyi of the Zhongxing Road Police Station sent patrol officers on the day shift to investigate household by household in the area under the jurisdiction of the police station to see if there were any opium smokers who had not registered. When police officer Wang Yingwen investigated the machinery factory, he saw that the door of the stove room was tightly closed. He ordered the second landlord, Jiang Yushan, to open the door, but Jiang replied that there was no one in the room, but the door was not locked. Police Officer Wang became even more suspicious. At first, he thought there must be opium smokers in the room. Who knew that after opening the door, he saw two printing machines? When asked what they were printing, the workers and apprentices replied that they were cigarette cards. Police Officer Wang ordered them to take them out to see. At first, the worker only took out a single sheet of watermarked double-sided counterfeit banknotes. The police officer could not see it clearly, so he took it himself from the shelf to read. He then saw that it was a single-sided counterfeit banknote of the Chinese Farmers Bank with a double bill of one yuan that had already been printed. He then realized that it was a counterfeit currency manufacturing factory. At this time, Jiang already knew that it could not be concealed and repeatedly begged for mercy, so he promised to bribe him with 100 yuan in national currency. The police officer falsely claimed that the matter was of great importance and that the amount of 100 yuan was too small, and then left for further discussion. Jiang thought that the accident could be avoided. Who knew that after the police officer left the door, he ran to the nearby guard post police officer Zhang Runxi and came back together. Police Officer Zhang guarded the workers and others, and Police Officer Wang ran out to call the Zhongxing Road Police Station. After receiving the report, Inspector Xie Zhongyi immediately led police chiefs Li Qingyun, Hao Likai, and Zhuang Jingzao to arrive and arrested all the people.</p>
<p>Names of the Criminals Arrested: Second landlord Jiang Yushan, 35 years old, from Anhui; printing workers Gu Linggen, 26 years old, from Changshu; Tian Mingyuan, 32 years old, from Changzhou; Zhang Linsheng, 34 years old, from Changshu; apprentices Jiang Yuanhe, 26 years old, from Anhui; Yang Ermao, 17 years old, from Shanghai; Jiang Yanggou, 16 years old, from Anhui; Zhang Hualang, 20 years old, from Shaoxing; Shen Amao, 16 years old, from Ningbo; suspect Zhao Xu, 42 years old, from Changshu; a total of ten people were arrested.</p>
<p>Evidence Seized: 12,000 yuan of red single-sided printed double bills of the counterfeit Chinese Farmers Bank banknotes were seized on the spot, along with 10,000 yellow initial versions of watermarked double bills of counterfeit banknotes, two lead seals, two machines, a total of 36 items, two models of counterfeit Chinese Farmers Bank banknotes, 25 lead blocks, a front mercury plate, a reverse mercury plate, three boxes of colored oil, etc. After being taken back to the station, they confessed that the main culprit in this case (i.e., the boss) was Wang Ziliang, the husband of Zhao Xu, who had gone out to buy things and were all on the run. After a brief interrogation by Inspector Xie, they were immediately escorted to the Xinzha Branch and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Completion of the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes: Date of Completion Ceremony Set: Total Construction Cost Over 100,000 Yuan: Magnificent and Imposing, Worthy of Adoration by Future Generations <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>In order to commemorate the soldiers and civilians who died in the "January 28th" Shanghai War, the Gu Gongtuan of this city and leaders from all walks of life raised funds to build the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes in Miaoxing Town, Jiangwan. Since construction began in July of the 23rd year of the Republic, the entire project has been completed, and the completion ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 28th of this month. The reporter of the Dagongshe has learned the following information:</p>
<p>Process of Preparation and Construction: During the January 28th Shanghai War in the 21st year of the Republic, a large number of soldiers and civilians in our country were killed. Afterwards, various public organizations in this city and leaders from all walks of life initiated the construction of the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes, so that future generations could admire them. Zhang Gongquan, Zhang Xiaoliang, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Du Chongyuan, Kui Yanfang, Shen Yi, Hu Yunqiu, Dong Dayou, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yansong, and Wang Xiaolai were appointed as construction committee members. The tomb site was surveyed and determined to be in Miaoxing Town, Jiangwan, which belongs to Baoshan County. The tomb site was donated by the Baoshan Shanghai Association, totaling more than 30 mu. However, the location is in the countryside, and the transportation is inconvenient. A road connecting Shanghai was specially built, connecting Lingnan Road in Zhabei to the south and Dachang Town to the west. The entire road was completed in the 23rd year. As for the construction expenses, in addition to the 10,000 yuan donated by the local association, the rest was assisted by important central figures and leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai. The entire project was designed by architect Dong Dayou as a voluntary service, with a total cost of more than 100,000 yuan. After construction began in the 23rd year of the Republic, the entire project was completed in December of last year.</p>
<p>Completion of the Project: The first part of the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes project to be completed was the tomb gate, aisle, surrounding wall, flagpole, stone steps, tombstone, tomb site, and stone coffin (containing the clothes and hats of the deceased). There is a small stream in the middle of the aisle from the gate to the tomb hall, and a bridge has been built. The second phase of the project was the laying of stone steps in front of the hall (using genuine domestic stones), and artificial stones were used around the tomb hall. There are gardens all around. A stone coffin is stored in the tomb hall, with a memorial tablet erected on it. The third phase of the project (i.e., completed at the end of last year) is the Martyrs' Memorial Tower, with miscellaneous items and all the arrangements in the tomb hall. The tombstone was inscribed with the five characters "Tomb of the Unknown Heroes" by Chairman Jiang. The tomb inscription was handwritten by Mr. Zhang Gongquan. Magnificent and imposing, worthy of adoration by future generations.</p>
<p>Completion Ceremony: After the entire project of the tomb was completed, the preparatory committee is now preparing for the completion ceremony. The committee decided to hold the completion ceremony on the anniversary of January 28th because the tomb was established to commemorate January 28th. The reporter of the Dagongshe met with a member of the preparatory committee yesterday. According to him, the completion ceremony of the Tomb of the Unknown Heroes is tentatively scheduled to be held on the 28th of this month. However, whether or not to invite all walks of life at that time, and what kind of ceremony will be held, still needs to be discussed and decided by the preparatory committee.</p>

<p>Wu Fugui, a native of Yancheng, 29 years old, lived in a thatched house in East Dapu Road and made a living by pulling carts. Unfortunately, he was murdered on New Year's Eve at around 12:00 AM. Three thugs suddenly came in, one wearing a gray robe, one wearing an overcoat, and one wearing blue cloth shirt and pants. At that time, Wu was already asleep. The one wearing the overcoat shined a flashlight on him and identified him. Then the one wearing blue cloth pulled out a gun and fired three shots. Wu, being strong and brave, did not fall to the ground. He fired four more shots before hitting him. Two shots hit the head, one in the forehead, with the bullet exiting from the ear, and one in the lip, with the bullet exiting from the back of the neck. One shot hit the abdomen, with the bullet exiting from the back. One shot hit the right leg and one shot hit the left arm, totaling five shots to the body, which proved fatal. At that time, Hu Jueming, the police officer at the nearby post No. 82, heard the alarm and went to pursue the thugs, but they had already escaped. The police officer reported to the Liyuan Road Police Station, which in turn reported to the West Gate Branch, requesting the arrest of the murderer. The local保 informed the court for an autopsy. Subsequently, the deceased's sister-in-law, Wu Wang, came to the case and testified that her younger uncle had pulled a car for Zhou Bu Kui, a Chinese detective in the French Concession police station, but he had resigned more than two months ago. Recently, he had been sick and not doing business. She heard her younger uncle say that he had 80 yuan that he did not send, and that he would make them look good. She didn't know what money it was. After the court examined the body, in addition to filling out the death certificate and ordering the local善堂 to prepare a coffin for burial, they ordered the arrest of the murderer for interrogation.</p>

<p>Xu Axi (27 years old, from Wuxi), an apprentice at the Zhenxingguan Dim Sum Shop at No. 390 Zhejiang Road, slept in the shop hall with four other apprentices the night before last. Unexpectedly, the gas pipe that was installed more than 20 years ago by the Shanghai Gas Company in the alley behind the shop suddenly burst, causing gas to rush into the shop hall. Xu and the others were all poisoned by the coal gas in their sleep and lost consciousness. It was not until around 7:00 AM the next morning that Qin Panquan, the old steward of the shop, discovered it and reported it to the Laozha Patrol Room, ordering the detectives to investigate. An ambulance was called and Xu and the others were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Xu died because he had been poisoned too deeply and the rescue was ineffective. The detectives then carried Xu's body to the Fielun Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, the prosecutor of the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, came to the office and confirmed the identity of the body. They then ruled that the deceased Xu Axi had died of coal gas poisoning during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his cousin, Huang Aji, for burial after signing a guarantee. It was also learned that several apprentices in a barber shop at No. 394 next door also suffered from the same poisonous gas.</p>

<p>Zhang Xu, a young woman from Nanxun, 21 years old, lived with her husband Zhang at No. 134 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. Recently, Zhang had lost his job and was poor, resulting in poverty and illness, and the couple cried to each other all day long. Zhang Xu went out alone on September 10th of last year and went to a pimping shop in Baxianqiao, Chen 志願, asking to be recommended as a maid. The shop owner, A, seeing that she was quite beautiful, thought she could be deceived and allowed her to stay, pretending to find a way to recommend her, but in fact secretly colluding with pimp Qiu Yongnian at No. 10, Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, entertainer Li Meili at No. 6, Leyu Lane, and pimp Xu Wang at No. 42, Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road to mortgage Xu to Qiu. A mortgage agreement was written, falsely claiming that the woman's mother came forward, with a mortgage price of 150 yuan, which was divided among themselves. However, they falsely told Xu that Qiu hired her as the big sister and forced her to sign the mortgage agreement, taking advantage of her illiteracy. From then on, the woman entered the cage, and her actions were directed by Qiu Yongnian. Every night, she was forced to go to major hotels to solicit male customers. After four nights, she earned more than ten gold coins, all of which went into Qiu's pocket. The woman could not bear the pain, so she took the opportunity to escape on the fifth day and ran back home. After losing Xu, they did not know where she had gone, so they did not disclose the matter. On the 2nd of this month, Xu unexpectedly met Qiu and Li on the road. Qiu and Li immediately demanded the mortgage price, thus discovering Xu's address. The day before yesterday, they even gathered a group of hooligans to come to the door to extort money, with a fierce momentum. The woman, because her husband was sick in bed, did not dare to let him be frightened, and quickly went out to report the capture, arresting Qiu, Li, and Xu Wang together and taking them to the French Police Station. As the incident occurred in the Public Concession, they were immediately transferred to the Laozha Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Liu Yugui. After the lawyer Jiang Baolian from the Patrol Room explained the case, he requested that the three defendants be punished under Article 231 of the Criminal Law. Zhang Xu also stated the collusion process of the defendants at that time. When questioned, the defendants shirked responsibility and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them. The court ruled that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>The Gospel Broadcasting Station on the Museum Road, which was funded by Christians, was established in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic. It does not operate commercially, but only broadcasts programs that benefit society. Because the original power of 150 watts was still too weak for distant places, a new American-style 1,000-watt large generator has been built. Its power is the strongest among民营电台. The completion ceremony was held at 5:00 PM on New Year's Day. More than 400 leaders from all walks of life attended. The program was as follows: Zhu Orchestra played music, Mr. Wang Wanbai, the general manager of the station, reported, Chairman Zhao Jinqing gave an opening speech, Lin Ling Luo sang poetry, Dr. Cheng Jingyi from Beiping read the Bible, and Ms. Storia Fasha and Tui Ershi played music together, Pastor Zhu Guishen prayed, Madam Jiang Song Meiling gave a speech, Ms. Ge Luolan sang, Zhang Yuejun's wife spoke on the responsibility of Christians to society, Parker sang a solo, President Bu Fangji of Saint John's University gave a speech in English, Miss Wang Meili sang a solo, President Liu Zhancen of Shanghai University gave a speech on struggle, unity, and sacrifice, Zhu Chongzhi and Xia Guoqiong of the National Conservatory of Music played music together, and Tan Xiaolin played the琵琶.

<p>Qu Zhifu Hospital on Penglai Road, run by the renowned physician Qu Zhifu, has consistently cured dangerous and severe illnesses over the years. As a result, it has garnered widespread praise and a growing reputation. Recently, Mr. Ji Zhizhong from our newspaper suffered from nasal polyps since childhood, which would recur from time to time. They had never been completely eradicated. Unexpectedly, in the past six months, the condition suddenly worsened, causing almost unbearable pain. Symptoms such as headaches, toothaches, and facial swelling also arose. He decided to seek treatment at the hospital. Doctors Qing Kang and Zhu Qi of the hospital performed a surgical removal. Initially, four nasal polyps were removed from the left nostril, followed by three from the right. The surgery was swift and painless. He has now been safely discharged from the hospital. Mr. Ji is extremely grateful for the hospital's profound medical knowledge and excellent surgical skills, as his ailment of over twenty years has been completely cured.</p>

<p>Changming Company, located at No. 10, Lane 611, Chengdu Road, was established in the spring of 1930. Initially, it manufactured Sanguang brand flashlights, pocket electric heaters, and machine parts. Later, recognizing the popularity of foreign clocks in the domestic market, the company decided to switch to manufacturing Sanguang brand clocks, hoping to stem the outflow of money. They made every effort to use domestic raw materials, machinery, steel molds, and lathes. After more than two years of dedicated research and numerous trials and improvements, the clocks were finally launched. They quickly gained popularity nationwide, making the company a leading force in the domestic clock industry. With the government's implementation of legal tender and the soaring exchange rates, orders poured in. Despite working day and night, they still struggled to meet the demand. Unexpectedly, at around 4 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out in the western section of the factory, burning for over two hours. All of their assets were destroyed in the blaze. The company's losses amount to no less than 200,000 yuan, a significant loss for the domestic goods industry. The company's management is currently meticulously planning for all necessary follow-up measures. They intend to persevere and restore the company to its original state as quickly as possible, while also striving for expansion to achieve their original goal of reclaiming lost interests.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Public Security Bureau Plans Annual Reduction of Opium Addicts After Deadline for Registration, Aiming to Eradicate Opium Addiction Within a Set Timeframe, While Simultaneously Intensifying Crackdown Efforts <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau's registration of opium addicts has concluded at the end of last year. This year will mark the start of searches, arrests, and rehabilitation, making the anti-opium work increasingly intensive. The Dagongshe reporter has gathered the following details for your information:</p>
<p>Compiling Statistics, Planning Gradual Reduction. The purpose of the Public Security Bureau's registration of opium addicts is to ascertain the exact number of opium addicts in this city, to formulate a plan for their gradual reduction, thereby eradicating opium addiction. Now that the registration of opium addicts has concluded, detailed statistics should be compiled regarding the number of opium addicts, their ages, addresses, the amount of opium they consume, and the deadlines for their rehabilitation. A special register should be created to facilitate the calculation of daily opium consumption reduction and the verification of deadlines. The Bureau's Opium Addict Registration Section has been compiling these statistics for days. This task is time-consuming due to the number of registered addicts exceeding 37,000. It is expected to be completed by the end of this month. After the statistics are compiled, a plan for annual gradual reduction will be formulated, aiming to eradicate opium addiction within a set timeframe.</p>
<p>Discussing Measures, Intensifying Crackdown. The Bureau acknowledges the enthusiastic participation in the registration of opium addicts. However, some stubborn individuals still refuse to register. The Bureau can no longer tolerate such individuals and will intensify crackdown efforts. Last month, over 3,000 opium addicts were arrested in crackdown operations. Crackdown efforts will be further intensified moving forward. In addition to the Public Security Bureau sending official letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Police Department for assistance at any time, Mr. Dai, the section chief of the Opium Addict Registration Section, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon with Mr. Zhou Peisan, the head of the Crackdown Unit, and others to discuss measures for intensifying the crackdown. In addition to the decision to reward informants, various other measures were also discussed.</p>
<p>Opium Rehabilitation Hospitals to be Established by a Deadline. Since the Public Security Bureau's registration of opium addicts ended, over 14,000 people who were unable to register have applied for rehabilitation. In addition to the 3,161 people who have already been sent for rehabilitation and the 2,696 people who have successfully quit, over 10,000 people are waiting to be sent for rehabilitation. With the intensification of crackdown efforts, the number of people requiring rehabilitation will inevitably increase. The establishment of a new opium rehabilitation hospital in the city center is urgently needed. According to an official in charge of preparations at the Public Health Bureau, the new opium rehabilitation hospital is now fully equipped, with a capacity of 1,000 people. It was originally scheduled to be established on the 5th, but due to minor incomplete equipment and personnel selection, the opening has been postponed to the 16th of this month, with no further delays expected.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Ye Zicai Transferred for Questioning in Red Pill Drug Case <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>On November 23rd of last year, Wang Changgen from Hangzhou sent six foreign flour sacks to the Xiedaxing Transportation Company at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Station in the Nanshi district to be shipped to Lanxi, Zhejiang. He claimed that the sacks contained medicinal herbs. The company requested a letter of introduction from the sender, but Wang claimed that he did not have it with him and would go to retrieve it. The company sent an employee with Wang to retrieve the letter. As they were traveling to the Ximen district, Wang acted suspiciously and attempted to flee. The employee immediately called police officer Wang, who arrested Wang and took him to the Ximen Public Security Bureau. Later, detective squad leader Shen Wenda, along with detectives, took Wang to the Xiedaxing Transportation Company, opened the foreign flour sacks, and discovered that they contained valuable raw materials for the drug red pills, morphine, and white powder, worth over 100,000 yuan. At the same time, Jin Huaren, an accomplice from Jinhua who was delivering the goods, was apprehended at the company entrance. Wang and Hu, along with the drugs, were taken to the bureau for questioning. Hu confessed that the goods were entrusted to him by Ye Zicai from Taizhou, who resided at No. 21, Renshouli, Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. The detectives immediately contacted the French Concession police and requested assistance in arresting Ye Zicai. Ye was arrested and sent to the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Xiong Huicui held two hearings to interrogate him. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, represented by legal advisor Zhan Jifeng, requested that Ye be transferred for questioning. He also presented two official documents from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, dated November 1934, regarding the YiWu County Government's arrest of red pill offender Wang Ronggui and others, who confessed to purchasing red pills from Ye Zicai, requesting Ye's arrest. The detectives brought Wang and Hu to the court for confrontation. Ye Zicai denied entrusting Wang and Hu to transport drugs, and, claiming that he had been residing in the French Concession for many years, opposed the transfer. Lawyer Ge Zhitan defended him. Judge Xiong, upon reviewing the evidence, deemed the evidence complete and ruled that Ye Zicai would be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning. Ye was dissatisfied and filed an appeal, which was rejected by the High Third Branch Court, upholding the original ruling. The case file was returned to the Special No. 2 Court for execution. Upon receiving the case file, the Special No. 2 Court notified the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, which dispatched detectives to the Special No. 2 Court yesterday morning to transfer Ye. At 10:30 am, Judge Xiong personally went to the Second Criminal Court, instructed the police to bring Ye Zicai from the detention center, and after questioning his name and background, ordered that Ye Zicai be handed over to the officers from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>Chen Tianyuan (44 years old), a Fujianese residing at No. 2, Zhoushanli, Zhoushan Road, conspired with Zhang Arong (who has already been arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau) at around 3 pm on December 23rd of last year to sell 812 silver dollars at a certain address in Mengjiang Lane, Wusong Road, exchanging currency to profit from the price difference. He was arrested by the Huishan Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case, stating that the silver dollars came from two employees of a cigarette paper shop who specialized in such illegal activities. The buyer had a disagreement with the sellers over the premium price, and the transaction fell through. The suspects then stole 212 silver dollars. He requested the court to extend the detention period in accordance with Articles 2 and 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Smuggling Common Silver Coins for profit. When questioned, Chen Tianyuan confessed to knowing Zhang Arong for many years. He admitted that he had brought the silver coins and entrusted Shi Wenxiang to negotiate the price. The old silver coins were exchanged for a premium of eight cents per dollar, and the new silver coins for six cents per dollar. However, the transaction was canceled due to an argument. He gave conflicting answers to other questions. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to remain in custody for further questioning in seven days.</p>

However, he suddenly collapsed at the entrance of Yonghaili. It was not until around 9 pm that Tang Luheng, a police officer from the No. 9 post of the Laobeimen Police Station, discovered him while patrolling. Upon closer inspection, the deceased had blood flowing from his nostrils and was not wearing shoes. The death appeared strange. Patrol Officer Zhang Lantian of the police station led officers to conduct a thorough investigation. They summoned Wu Futting's wife, Yang, for questioning. As the case involved a human life, the local headman was instructed to report to the District Court for an autopsy. The police were also dispatched for further investigation to determine the truth.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the news column of your newspaper dated December 27, 1935, there is an article titled "Zhuang Yindi Accuses Yi Fangshuo of Enticement and Illegal Imprisonment." The article states, "Zhuang Yindi of the Sanmei Spiritual Group has recently retained lawyers Jin Xiongbo and Lou Yunmei to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Yi Fanghu of the crimes of enticement and illegal imprisonment," and so on. After investigating, our lawyer was appointed by the defendant Yi Fangshuo on the day to defend him in court, and did not act on behalf of Pei Yindi in the lawsuit. Now that Yi Fangshuo has been declared innocent, the circumstances of the case are self-evident and do not require any claim. However, many people concerned about Yi's case have expressed doubts about the integrity of our lawyer due to this point. We are deeply concerned that this misinformation will spread and affect business credit. We are hereby sending a letter to clarify the facts and request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to ensure accuracy and avoid misunderstandings. We are eagerly awaiting your response. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Lou Yunmei</p>

<h3 id="e149">The Principles of Curing Lung Disease and "Hormone" Therapy <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Curing Pulmonary Tuberculosis: The key lies in vigorous physiological defense mechanisms. To achieve a cure for pulmonary tuberculosis, one must first understand how the lesions of pulmonary tuberculosis are naturally cured. This is a very important question, and patients must investigate it. According to what is seen in theory, when tubercle bacillus invades the lung, it multiplies and develops, producing toxins. The lung tissue then undergoes pathological changes, and a small transparent object appears. Over time, it turns yellow and becomes as large as a millet grain. Over time, it gradually expands and becomes a hard lump (this is the lesion). At this time, the tissue cells in the human body exert their natural ability to resist it with all their strength, surrounding and blocking it, so as to stop the pathological changes. This is the physiological defense mechanism in living organisms, and in short, it is natural healing power. The waxing and waning of this defense mechanism determines the victory or defeat of the war between the body and the bacteria. If the defense power is strong, a very strong substance called connective tissue will grow around the lesion, forming a fortress to confine the lesion and completely stop its activity, eventually stopping it completely, leading to a cure. If the defense power is insufficient, the natural healing power will be reduced, and the body will be defeated by the bacteria. As a result, the disease will continue to be active, the symptoms will gradually worsen, and it will become incurable. From this point of view, whether lung disease can be cured depends on the strength of the physiological defense power. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Both Animals and Plants Have This Physiological Defense Mechanism: Both animals and plants, all living things have this natural healing power—that is, physiological defense mechanism. For example, if you break a branch of a plant, it will sprout again at that place; if you damage the skin of an animal, it will form a scar at that place and heal. This is all natural healing power, which I believe everyone is familiar with.</p>
<p>When Illness Entangles the Body: The Defense Mechanism Must Be Weak. To make the lesions of pulmonary tuberculosis heal quickly, there must be a vigorous physiological defense mechanism—and sufficient natural healing power—to achieve this healing goal. However, if a person suffering from tuberculosis has the disease lingering in the body for a long time, these functions are often hindered, and some may even be unable to develop. At this time, we must pay attention to treatment. As mentioned above, the purpose of treatment is to use the natural mechanism and human assistance—to strengthen the physiological defense mechanism—and promote the restoration of natural healing phenomena and mechanisms. Apart from the body's natural healing power, there is no other reliable treatment. If we want to restore this natural healing power, we must first explore the reasons for the decline of its function; so-called auxiliary methods, no matter what kind of medicine is used, will not work. According to the great British physiologist STARLING, the reason for the weakness of the physiological defense mechanism is actually due to the lack of an "internal secretion" in the body. As the saying goes, "When the oil runs out, the lamp goes out," the same principle applies. If you want to restore the light of the lamp—you must add oil first; if you want to restore our physiological function—you must supplement its "internal secretion." There is no doubt about this. Therefore, today's most reliable and well-founded fundamental treatment for lung disease is only the natural supplementation therapy using the endocrine "hormone," which is both reasonable and effective.</p>
<p>The Role of Endocrine "Hormones": Greatly Related to Physical Health. Hormone therapy, also known as ORGANOTHERAPTE hormone—MONE, is a type of endocrine substance produced by the endocrine glands in the animal body. The function of hormones is to promote the development of the body and mind, regulate the elements of material metabolism, and destroy substances harmful to the body, making them harmless. Therefore, the relationship between hormones and physical health is very important, and excesses or deficiencies can cause disease.</p>
<p>"Hormone" Therapy: It has long existed among Chinese and foreign folk customs. Organ therapy for diseases has existed since ancient times. For example, in 460-377 BC, the ancient Indians used to boil the brains of birds for people suffering from headaches to eat; those with liver and stomach diseases would eat the liver and stomach of pigs and sheep; those with coughs and shortness of breath would eat the lungs of cattle, horses, pigs and sheep; and those with weak male reproductive organs would eat the testicles of cattle and horses. Even in our country, old Chinese medicine or folk customs often use animal organs or human blood and excrement to treat diseases. Since ancient times, both China and foreign countries have secretly had the idea of applying "hormone" therapy.</p>
<p>When the endocrine secretion of any organ in our body decreases—or any "hormone" decreases, leading to disease, we should use the organs of other animals that contain the same "hormone," or its preparations, injected or taken internally, to supplement the lack of that "hormone" and achieve the purpose of treating the symptoms. This is called "hormone" therapy, or "endocrine" therapy. In ancient times, the method of eating organs to treat diseases was very crude, but it sometimes worked. Now, medical advances are changing with each passing day, with detailed research by branch and department, and the ancient, simple organ therapy has been transformed into the newest and most effective new therapy through the experiments of modern biologists and chemical research.</p>
<p>Pulmonary Tuberculosis: "Hormone" therapy is the most reasonable and effective. The parenchyma of the lungs of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis develops tuberculosis, which causes the function of the endocrine to decline—the production of "hormones" decreases, so the metabolism of substances is obstructed, which affects the weakness of the physiological defense mechanism—the decline of natural healing power. Therefore, the disease gradually expands, and the symptoms become more and more dangerous, progressing from the initial stage to the second stage, and then from the second stage to the final stage. In this way, it drags on until it is incurable. Therefore, the only way to treat pulmonary tuberculosis is to strengthen its physiological defense function, then the way to start treatment should follow these natural healing actions, and use lung preparations containing the same "hormone," to imitate and improve it by internal or injection methods? The most accurate and effective. This kind of lung hormone preparation is called "Lung Vital" Phith Weal, used for the treatment of lung diseases, it can fully develop its physiological defense function—strengthen its natural healing power, so the function is great and magical, and its effect on treating pulmonary tuberculosis is really amazing.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Newest Hormone Preparation <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Ingredients and Functions of "Lung Vital" Phith Weal</p>
<p>According to the experiments and reports of most scholars. The only way to treat pulmonary tuberculosis. It all lies in strengthening its physiological defense function. Most suitable. The increase and decrease of this defense function. That is, the division of victory or defeat in the war between the body and bacteria. It is because the human body's defense power is strong. Then around the lesion. A very strong connective tissue grows. Wrap the lesion. Make the effect of pathological changes. Completely lose its activity. Eventually, it will completely stop. Until it is cured.</p>
<p>Therefore, to make the lesion heal quickly. We have to find appropriate methods. To supplement and promote its natural healing power. Make it vigorous. This kind of method. That is, the daily life of patients with this disease. Should strive to achieve a good state of hygiene. And its root lies in practicing hygiene and nutrition therapy.</p>
<p>The purpose of treating pulmonary tuberculosis. The purpose is to strengthen its physiological defense function. Has been mentioned above. However, the disease has been trapped in our body for a long time. Then this kind of function. Often occurs hindrance. Some of them are tamed and unable to develop. At this time, we have to use manpower to supplement it.</p>
<p>In the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. So far, there is no specific drug invented. There is absolutely no drug that can directly kill tubercle bacillus. And various drugs. Often only add meaningless stimulation to the lesion. On the contrary, it hinders the defense function of the tissue. Therefore, treating pulmonary tuberculosis with drugs. It is true that the harm is more than the benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Ironclad Evidence of Lung Vital's Main Ingredient, Hormone <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Figure A is a cross-shaped crystal of lung hormone. This picture was taken with a microscope enlarged 600 times. Figure B is a cross-shaped crystal of spleen hormone.</p>
<p>This hormone is extracted from the fresh lungs and spleen of strong animals.</p>
<p>Since the rise of organ therapy. Scholars also opened up a new path for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The use of hormone therapy. After many experiments. And prove its effect. It is also nothing more than strengthening its physiological defense function. Gain increasing the cure. Therefore, hormone therapy. Is still considered reasonable and effective for pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>"Lung Vital" Phith Weal is made from the effective ingredients (hormones) extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of mammals. It is a special drug for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Now, the ingredients and functions contained in the internal liquid of this product will be described below.</p>
<p>The first component is lung "hormone" Hormon of Pulmon—ary (attached to Figure A). It is extracted from the fresh lungs of strong mammals. Each bottle contains 20 cc of lung hormone, and each cc is equivalent to 100 grams of fresh lungs, so the quality is thick and the effect is sufficient. According to the clinical experiment reports of lung sanatoriums in various countries, after the tubercle bacillus patients take "Lung Vital" Phith Weal, its effective ingredient (that is, lung hormone) is immediately absorbed and circulates in various organs of the body, among which Yun presents a direct action on the lungs. Can stimulate its already weakened function, regulate metabolism, restore physiological defense function, promote the revitalization of natural healing power, such as tissue defects can be filled, at the same time, build a solid wall of connective tissue around the lesion, harden it, promote the formation of scars, completely wrap the evil tubercle bacillus, lose its activity, and eventually eliminate it completely, until it is completely healed. Lung hormone has a very strong effect on blood clotting. If patients have stubborn hemoptysis, taking "Lung Vital" Phith Weal can prevent it and there is no need to worry about recurrence. Lung hormone can neutralize the toxins secreted by tubercle bacillus in the body and has an inhibitory effect, so after taking "Lung Vital" Phith Weal for treatment, symptoms such as fever, cough, and night sweats will gradually disappear naturally.</p>
<p>The second component is spleen hormone HORMONE OF SPL EEN (attached to Figure B). It is extracted from the fresh brand of strong animals. Each bottle contains 20 cc of spleen hormone, and each cc is equivalent to 100 watts of fresh spleen. Its function can increase the number of red blood cells and the content of hemoglobin HaeMcglcbin in the patient's body, which has been reduced. It can also promote the growth of leukocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils Easino Philen. Spleen hormone can also limit the excretion of phosphate Phopliat in the blood. And increase the calcium content in the blood. At the same time, it can also restore the weakened tissues in the disease to their vigorous function. And promote the production of immune substances. Gradually increase the body's defense power. Spleen hormone is particularly important for the metabolism of lipids Lipoid and iron in the whole body. It also has the ability to promote the proliferation of connective tissue in the lesions. Surrounding the tuberculosis. And make it harden. Until it is cured. Spleen hormone. Also has a blood clotting effect. Preventing hemoptysis. It is also very significant.</p>
<p>"Lung Vital" Phith Weal has been used in strict animal experiments, and used in human treatment experiments. It has an amazing effect on lung diseases, but it has no side effects or any drawbacks, and it has a violent effect - chemical drug therapy that is harmful to the human body, it is really impossible to count.</p>
<p>The treatment range of "Lung Vital" Phith Weal has special effects for all first, second and third stage tuberculosis, cough, hemoptysis, blood sputum, wheezing, dyspnea, acute and chronic bronchitis. It can be taken by both old and young. If the body is weak - those who have the quality of being infected with tuberculosis, taking "Lung Vital" Phith Weal can fundamentally transform the body, promote the function of endocrine production, and make the nutritional status good, the lungs are strong, and can prevent the occurrence of tuberculosis, so it is "those with tuberculosis are treated for tuberculosis - those without tuberculosis promote health and prevent tuberculosis."</p>
<p>From this point of view, the treatment of lung disease is based on the principles of curing tuberculosis in modern times, and the experimental reports of clinical physicians, "Lung Vital" Phith Weal is indeed the most reasonable and well-founded hormone preparation. Moreover, our country today has no complete lung sanatorium, the people are poor, and there is no one in a hundred who has the ability to be hospitalized for treatment, so in family therapy, they cannot but beg for spirit medicine, and seek a way to remedy it. The internal therapy of "Lung Vital" Phith Weal is indeed feasible.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Prevention of Hemoptysis <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>The source of hemoptysis. There are about two kinds. One is bleeding when the tracheal branch point membrane is damaged. One is bleeding from rupture of blood vessels in lung tuberculosis cavities. The former is common in severe bronchitis, whooping cough, etc. when coughing severely. The latter is true lung tuberculosis hemoptysis. However, pulmonary paragonimiasis, lung abscess (i.e., lung suppurative), bronchial dilatation, lung syphilis, etc. also have symptoms of hemoptysis.</p>
<p>Lung tuberculosis cavities. Different sizes. When microvessels rupture in extremely small cavities. Cause small hemoptysis. Such as blood spots or blood streaks in coughed up sputum. When relatively large blood vessels rupture in large cavities. It causes large hemoptysis.</p>
<p>All cavities are mostly in communication with the trachea. Therefore, it is more difficult to stop bleeding. This is because the free end of the ruptured blood vessel in the cavity. There is no chance to compress and stop bleeding.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of hemoptysis. But there are very few who die directly from hemoptysis. And the blood clot. Blocks the trachea. Therefore, dying of suffocation is common.</p>
<p>The cause of hemoptysis. It is that the blood vessels undergo tuberculous changes. As a result, it ruptures. And mental agitation, or physical fatigue and cough are the causes.</p>
<p>Prevention of hemoptysis. It is impossible to prevent hemoptysis at the onset of the disease. If there is a violent cough. Then always try to remove it. Those with hemoptysis during the course of the disease. Often caused by excessive force. As a result, blood vessels rupture. Therefore, the prevention method. That is, no matter what kind of action. Always pay attention. Never use too much force. Anyone who has been diagnosed by a doctor as having early lung disease. You must engage in recuperation. Strictly abide by the health regimen.</p>
<p>Recently used drugs to prevent hemoptysis. The efficacy of organ preparations is very great. Such as those made from hormones extracted from lungs and spleen. "Lung Vital" Phith Weal is particularly effective. If there is stubborn hemoptysis. Blood spots or blood streaks are often found in the sputum. In addition to strictly observing the health regimen. Taking "Lung Vital" Phith Weal can achieve recovery.</p>

<p>The New Year of the 25th year of the Republic of China has arrived. You should be so happy to have food and play during this great New Year! And the schools have a vacation, allowing you to be free and do whatever you want. You are little angels in paradise, which is so enviable!</p>
<p>However, our country is now facing internal and external troubles, and the country is in dire straits! To save the country from danger, revive the nation, and avenge our humiliation and strive for strength, although it is the responsibility of adults, you children are the future masters of the country. Therefore, it can be said that you have a certain responsibility, and you must establish a new patriotic aspiration from this year. Even in the happy New Year, you must not forget the national crisis! You must carefully study all kinds of knowledge, listen carefully to the teachings of teachers, and follow the guidance of fathers and brothers. Have courage, perseverance, and diligence. Do not be lazy, do not lie, and do not be superstitious. These are all the initial preparations for becoming the masters of the country. In the future, you can serve the society and the country. This is a small opinion, and I hope that our dear children will adopt it!</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Year of the Rat Talk About Rats <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Rat. Let's talk to the children about rats: Bad people are called "rat-like fellows." Children should aspire to be people who are beneficial to society and the country. All "rat-thieving" behaviors should be avoided, so as not to be regarded by others as the most repulsive rat.</p>
<p>Cowardly people are called "as timid as a mouse." If people lack courage, they cannot act bravely when they should. They are called useless cowards. If a small, weak country like Aguo confronts a powerful one for so long, can it do so without courage? This is currently a proportional example. But being bold cannot mean recklessness, so the idiom says: "Have the courage of a lion, but the carefulness of a serpent."</p>
<p>People without resolve are called "hesitating between two opinions." This kind of mentality often causes one to miss good opportunities, which cannot be recovered. For example, children, in this golden age, are unwilling to make up their minds to study hard, and year after year, they make no progress. Then, "If you don't work hard when you are young, you will regret it when you are old." It will be too late to regret in the future. At the beginning of this new year, you must make up your mind.</p>
<p>A bubonic plague transmitted by fleas parasitizing on rats is called "rat plague." If this disease is discovered, it spreads extremely fast and causes many deaths. However, children, if you see others behaving badly and follow their example, when you are infected with bad habits and assimilated, it is truly "one who dwells near vermin is verminous." It is as dangerous as the rat plague spreading, at worst leading to personal ruin and disgrace, and in extreme cases, harming one's life. Therefore, you must not blindly follow when others do bad things.</p>
<p>Although rats are small things, some people use them to perform on the street, called "rat shows." Rats can be trained to perform and earn money. Children, if you have no skills, isn't this "being inferior to a rat"? Year of the Rat, Year of the Rat! How should you strive for progress?</p>

<p>On New Year's Day, Miss Shan got up very early. The sun shone in from outside the window, making the pot of daffodils on the table exceptionally green and upright. The small fruits of the nandina appeared even more vividly red, and the singing of the lark under the eaves was more melodious than usual. It seemed that there was a new atmosphere and new vigor before her eyes.</p>
<p>How happy Miss Shan was! She changed into new lake-green clothes, and asked her sister to pin a sprig of crabapple near her temples. She didn't apply powder or rouge, as she already had healthy, apple-colored cheeks. She was very busy going back and forth, and the little kitten followed her feet, as if helping with the work. It turned out that Miss Shan had planned to invite a few children to dinner on New Year's Day. The dishes were prepared by her sister, and the candy plate and decorations were arranged by herself.</p>
<p>The first guest to arrive was Li Shunfu, wearing a washed and cleaned calico shirt. He was the son of a tailor and came from a poor family, but Miss Shan always treated him very well because he loved cleanliness, was disciplined, and polite. At this moment, when they met, they bowed to each other, and Miss Shan led him to sit in the specially decorated guest room. The ceiling was covered with bright national flags and paper streamers, and the walls were covered with Miss Shan's handicrafts and crayon drawings. There were three vases of fresh flowers on the rectangular table.</p>
<p>After a while, Wang Dabao came, Huang Lifen came, Zhu Agui, Chen Manman, Zhang Renlin... also came. Everyone sat around eating candy and talking about what they did at home on New Year's Eve. Miss Shan then led all the children to sing the national anthem of the Republic of China, and asked her sister to play the organ. Then, she went upstairs to invite her mother down and introduced her to the guests. All the guests stood up and bowed respectfully. They sat down again and listened quietly to the speech:</p>
<p>"New Year's Day is originally a festival for children. Today, I am very happy to see you gathering together lovingly. I hope you will always be so loving, and when you grow up, you will still be on good terms. You should not be divided by wealth or status. Everyone should help each other, encourage each other, not learn from the inferior, not be lazy, be good children, and when you grow up, be sound good citizens, love your compatriots, love your country, and love the peaceful people of the world. Today, you can have as much fun as you want, but in the midst of happiness, don't forget that there are still many children suffering from hunger and cold!" After Miss Shan's mother finished speaking, it was time to eat. Everyone was very orderly.</p>
<p>The room was filled with a new atmosphere and new vigor. The national flag seemed exceptionally bright and radiant.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Visit to a Children's Sports Meet <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Minhang Public Education Center, in order to encourage children's interest in sports and to attract the attention of people in society to children's lives, held a children's sports meet on New Year's Day this year. On this day, the reporter also went to visit. Although the weather was not very good, there were still more than 80 children participating, which cannot but be said to be a good achievement!</p>
<p>This children's sports meet was divided into two groups, A and B. Group A had seven events: kicking shuttlecock, jump rope, archery, basketball, rolling iron hoop, obstacle race, and air gun target shooting. Group B had four events: kicking shuttlecock, archery, and rolling iron hoop. Some events had to be held on the sports field, and some could be held in the hall of the center. This decision was made because the drizzle in the sky was intermittent, so the interest was naturally affected to a considerable extent. However, the spirit of the children was still very enthusiastic, so the center, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, changed some of the sports that could be held indoors to be held indoors, such as racing, air gun target shooting, archery, basketball, etc., which would have to be held when the weather was clear!</p>
<p>The supplies for this children's sports meet were all provided by the center. At the same time, a lot of prizes were prepared, such as books, stationery, towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, handkerchiefs, toys, food, etc., which were prepared to be awarded to children with excellent results. This spirit of promoting children's sports is really admirable.</p>
<p>The happiness of children is now being widely noticed by adults! I also hope that public education institutions in various places will promote and reward it as much as possible within their capabilities.</p>

<p>The Women of Portugal The Men of Portugal</p>
<p>A Fallen Family Portugal, like our China, used to be a powerful country, but now its national strength is far from what it used to be. It lives quietly in a corner of Western Europe. Its territory is small, its population is small, revolutions and riots occur every year, people's livelihood is difficult, and national debt is piled up. Although it still has vast territories, its foundation is shaky, like a wealthy family that has fallen into decline. Although the frame is large, the content is empty, and it cannot avoid being laughed at by its neighbors as a "fallen family."</p>
<p>A Patterned National Flag The national flag of Portugal is: The entire surface is divided into red and green, green on the left, red on the right, and green is narrower than red. In the middle is a yellow circular pattern. (Two)</p>
<p>The Terrain is Like a Cloth Sail Portugal is located at the southwestern tip of Europe. It is bordered by Spain on the northeast and the Atlantic Ocean on the southwest. The Azores and Madeira archipelagos in northwestern Africa are also its directly affiliated territories. The terrain is long and narrow, quite like a cloth sail raised on a sailboat. (One)</p>
<p>Sanatorium for Lung Diseases The capital of Portugal, Lisbon, is located in the western part of the country, with beautiful scenery and a very good climate. People with lung diseases from various countries mostly live here to recuperate. (Four)</p>
<p>Many Vineyards Portugal is an agricultural country. Vineyards account for 35% of the country's land. They also have a famous product, which is cork stoppers. These cork stoppers are made from the bark of cork trees. After a layer of bark is peeled off, a new layer will grow in eight or nine years. Portugal and Spain account for 70% of the world's cork stoppers. (Three)</p>
<p>Men and Women The temperament of the Portuguese is very frivolous, they love vanity, like to enjoy themselves, and do not seek to improve. Education is not yet universal, and there are many people without knowledge in the lower classes of society. We can know what their clothes are like by looking at (Figure 5) and (Figure 6).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a gradual decrease in chips, with continued crowded long positions. It was difficult to sustain a rise, and banks were still selling eagerly. Coupled with rumors of negative news, Hua merchants' selling was triggered, fueling the bearish sentiment and breaking the 50 yuan mark. The result was a weak market, creating a situation where the opening price was the highest and the closing price was the lowest. In the early morning, the Sino-foreign telegrams passed during the New Year holiday. Big bars contracted again, and the American banks were flat. The local market was very weak.

Large households sold bars one after another. It was rumored that a certain bank had released a large batch of spot gold futures that it had previously collected. It broke through most of the 50 yuan mark. Hua merchants sold foreign exchange, and the forward market became even harder. The overall trend was weak. However, large households still had buying interest at low prices, and there was repeated circling. However, the power of the supply side had become strong, and the long side was difficult to resist.

<p>In recent days, after the end of the year and during the closing period, all silver and money industries were closed. Qianzhuang opened on the third day (the third), and banks opened one day later, on the fourth. They were very busy with various collections and settlements.

<p>Yesterday, the six trading exchanges of Hua Commercial Securities, due to the three-day New Year holiday, seemed to have a slightly stable environment. Although the North China incident still had some branches on the surface, it was heard that the authorities had a whole adjustment plan. Moreover, due to the New Year red market, most retail investors bought in, and large households such as No. 43 were also very enthusiastic about buying in. The market rose strongly, which was also a reaction to the previous days of weakness. The future may see no major fall, and the market will be stable for a while. Only the January futures, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, have not many days of trading. Around January 20, there will be some slight pressure. Yesterday's process: The opening of the current month's downsizing seemed slightly weak, but it was immediately pulled up, and people's sentiment was certain. Downsizing immediately saw a sharp rise, soaring by 1.3 yuan, followed by a surge of 1.7 yuan in the 1931 long-term bonds, which was a good situation that had not been seen in many months. The subsequent gains were not as good, and the gold short only rose by 0.3 yuan. The secondary market therefore showed some chaos, with ups and downs, but there were still more gains than losses. The market price also fluctuated by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The opening of the afternoon market was slightly weak at first, because No. 78 issued long-term downsizing, and then No. 43 absorbed each item again, and the market gradually rose. The positive sixth bond rose again by 0.45 yuan, and the popularity of the closing market became stronger. The current month's downsizing soared by 0.8 yuan, and the long-term bonds were still leveled by No. 78. The 1929 Customs Duty was not opened, and the entry from the 20th Customs was still 0.1. No. 4, 11, and 43 had more buying interest. The 23rd Customs Duty soared by 0.85 yuan, and the rest also rose by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. The market price fluctuated and rose, which was especially a good atmosphere for the New Year. As a result, the market price rose across the board, from several cents to as much as 2 yuan. The total number of transactions was 1.993 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are listed on the left for comparison (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market opened yesterday, and the trend remains firm. This is because the sales of spot yarn are becoming more active. The Sichuan group, which has been sluggish for a long time, has also started to purchase. Other groups, such as Changsha and Guangdong, also have strong demand. Market sentiment is even better. However, the general inclination of colleagues to sell remains undiminished, and the large amounts of funds from the financial sector are also being held securely. Therefore, the rosy picture has not been relaxed.</p>
<p>Bullish forces continue to maintain bidding on yarn. The yarn bidding market opened in the morning, and market sentiment was flat. The near months rose slightly, but the distant months turned downward, falling by four or five jiao. After the second session, it was heard that the spot yarn market was selling well, and bidding prices were stable. There was a lack of new sellers in the market, and market prices gradually rose. As a result, each month rose by three, five, or nine jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day, except for the current month, which rose by one yuan alone. In the afternoon session, because the closing price of the bidding in the morning was very low, sentiment eased slightly. Fortunately, sellers were not aggressive, and the market turned upward again in the second and third sessions. The Hunan and Guangdong groups were particularly active in purchasing, and the amounts tightened by the bulls were firmly held. As a result, each month rose by one, two, four, five to nine jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Tongji sold 750 bales, Dafu 300 bales, Zhenda 450 bales, Hexing 300 bales, Taichang 1,150 bales, Yichang 450 bales, Runkang 1,150 bales, Changfeng 300 bales, and Jinkang 350 bales.

<p>Tuesday, December 31st: U.S. cotton opened, and the trend was firm due to short covering in the near month. Only two delivery notices for the January contract were issued, and there was a lack of new accounts. Colleagues were watching. The market situation was mixed in the afternoon. Colleagues bought the near month, and shorts shifted from near to distant months. Finally, due to rumors that the government had stopped issuing notices, there was a lot of short covering in January and March. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points, near-month prices rose by 8 to 18 points, and distant-month prices fell by 3 to 8 points. British spot cotton fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton rose due to firm silver prices and short covering and speculative buying. European exporters sold slightly. It is estimated that Pingor fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Omra fell by 1 rupee, and White Rosi fell by 1.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Thursday, January 2nd: U.S. cotton opened, with short covering and colleagues and foreign firms buying the distant months. Each month rose by 2 to 5 points. According to reports, the government needs the January contract, and market sentiment is very firm. Later, the government sold January and bought the distant months, weakening the market slightly. There were not many sellers, and the actual position was relatively firm. Even if the court judgment is unfavorable, it will not have much impact. As a result, spot prices rose by 10 points, and futures rose by 8 to 14 points. British spot cotton rose by 5 points, and futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton initially rose due to large-scale buying by futures traders and speculators, but later fell back due to selling by Japanese firms and White Rosi rising by 2.25 rupees.</p>
<p>Friday, January 3rd: U.S. cotton opened, and the market was sluggish. Each month rose or fell by 1 to 5 points. All transactions were mostly for liquidation purposes. Liverpool firms were the major buyers, and colleagues also bought. The amounts of hedging and bullish liquidation were all absorbed. There was a lack of new accounts, and hedging and bullish liquidation continued. Prices then weakened. Spot prices were firm. Domestic factories made slight inquiries. Hester estimated that factory usage for the week was 309,000 bales, and Liverpool's inventory was 385,000 bales. The market closed flat. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 5 to 9 points. British spot cotton remained unchanged, and futures rose by 1 point.

<p>The Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange held a cotton appraisal meeting on December 30th for the purpose of delivery in June of the 25th year. As a result of the appraisal, two new grades were added to the first grade. The original four types of A, B, C, and D were Lingbao cotton, Luoyang cotton, Tianjin American cotton, and Shandong American cotton, which were four grades. Now, Nanyuan cotton, Chaoyi cotton, Beihe cotton, Zhangde cotton, and Weinan cotton are newly added to the second grade. In the second grade, Baiwan cotton and Qiyang cotton are added as two grades. The remaining third and fourth grades have not been changed and are the same as the May grades. The audited and modified procedure grade prices are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a cotton yarn appraisal meeting was convened on December 26th for the review of the two-month delivery substitutes for June and July of the 25th year. As a result, only the 20-count Jin Shuangxi brand produced by Shenxin No. 6 Factory was added, and the grades of the remaining 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count remained unchanged and were the same as in May. It was found that the bidding yarn grade inspection grades were previously inspected monthly, but from the June period of the 25th year onwards, they will be changed to bi-monthly inspections, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market presented a mixed picture of gains and losses. The market opened in the morning, and although foreign wheat was reported to be down by about one jiao, market sentiment was stable because the Lunar New Year was approaching, and factory output was also more restricted. Small short positions were covered by small buy-ins, so since February, prices have been slightly firm. However, later, as trading was very light, prices weakened again. In the afternoon session, the current month fell to 3 yuan and 1 and a half fen at one point due to long liquidation, and the distant months also fell by 1 fen. However, after the second session, factories watched, and off-market players made slight purchases, causing prices to rise again, recovering 1 fen from the opening price. Currently, actual sales are not strong, and the end of the month is approaching, so it is feared that there will not be much difference.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market was quite weak because both sides had insufficient chips and were unable to compete. Currently, factory demand is weak, and inventory is also scarce, so there is no place to use one's energy, and most are watching. However, because the flour market is not advancing, market sentiment has also turned slightly lazy. The January contract saw no trading in either direction, and the February contract fell by 6 fen. The new wheat for June has opened for bidding as usual, with an opening price of 4 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, which is still close to the current situation. However, because the northern route is forecasting a bumper snow year, market sentiment is bearish. The closing price in the afternoon fell to 4 yuan and 3 jiao and 4 fen, a drop of 1 jiao and 1 fen. Spot wheat prices remained stable due to insufficient inventory, with Shandong wheat opening at 4 yuan and 9 jiao and Danyang wheat at 4 yuan and 9 jiao and 9 fen. It is estimated that 1,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin and Zao Feng Shenda.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources for each group were extremely abundant, with a total of more than 90 numbers arriving (a total of more than 18,000 shi). There was still some movement on this street, but the market situation was difficult to maintain and turned weak. As a result, thick geng rice and early rice fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao. As for thin rice, the bao wei group moved but did not feel refreshed, only about 2,000 bags, so the market also fell by one jiao. Dujian rice fell by five fen, and foreign jian rice was scarce and stabilized, with no major fluctuations.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Since New Year's Day, goods have continued to arrive. Yesterday, the arrivals from all routes in He Xia were quite strong, about 50 to 60 numbers.

<p>Yesterday, ke xian rice was sold at reduced prices because the market had a thick inventory and arrivals had been uninterrupted in recent days, so market sentiment was weak. Cargo owners mostly reduced prices to seek sales in order to close out the year, so trading was quite active yesterday, and the market continued to be reduced by three to five fen to one jiao. A total of 3,640 bags of Gan rice, 550 bags of Yong rice, 700 bags of Sha City Hankou rice, and 2,770 bags of Wen Tai rice were all purchased from this street. Foreign rice inventories were scarce, and prices were sold cheaply. Yesterday, there were only 250 bags of Siamese rice as a decoration.</p>

<p>The foreign sesame market presented a trend of initial decline followed by a rise. At the initial opening in the morning, some vendors were eager to sell due to settlement relationships because spot goods were arriving one after another, causing the standard sentiment to soften, down one jiao, three or four fen compared to the closing price before the New Year. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, foreign firms were quite active in their demand for spot goods, so the standard market also saw a prosperous flow, rising by one jiao and a half compared to the morning. It is heard that spot transactions reached a huge 800, and the price has opened to 13 yuan and 7 jiao, it is said.</p>

It has been found that since the New Year, a huge 1,400 to 1,500 dan have been sold, but there are still many buyers. Market sentiment is optimistic about the subsequent market because there is little circulating cargo. As for the three-by-six-foot three-to-thirteen-sheet patterned goods, the price is still opening to about 9 yuan per dan because the sales power is not strong, it is said.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Delusion is one of the symptoms of mental disorders. Its types include delusional jealousy, imaginary delusions, hallucinatory delusions, emotional delusions, grandiose delusions, and logical delusions, which are distinguished by their content. There are also grandiose delusions, delusions of guilt, delusions of insignificance, delusions of terror, and delusions of persecution.</p>
<p>Delusion is the judgment of error and false belief. There are three characteristics: The content of the delusion is impossible and absurd. The content of the delusion is inconsistent with the level of education and the circumstances of the environment. Although the content of the delusion is a false belief, the patient has extremely strong confidence.</p>
<p>If this condition is not treated early, the delusion will become increasingly delusional and extremely dangerous. Initially, it will not only lose its proper soundness.</p>

There are hundreds of complications, and the pain is extremely deep, which is pitiful.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best way to treat women's leukorrhea is to secretly self-treat at home. (Treatment for Leukorrhea is Effective) The skill is effective quickly. The method is simple and easy.

<p>Young people are full of vitality, and their desires are most easily impulsive. A moment of carelessness will not only lose health, but also life, happiness, offspring, and longevity will be affected. How frightening!</p>
<p>Masturbation is the most common bad habit for young people. Secret self-indulgence is common. It destroys life and consumes essence. It is huge and fierce. It often leads to nocturnal emission, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and other venereal diseases. I don't know how many people's happiness has been sacrificed.</p>

<p>The patient Zhuang Xianting had been masturbating since he was young, resulting in severe nocturnal emission. Medical treatment was ineffective. He continued until this autumn, when he initially sought treatment at my place. I instructed him to purchase "Hemet's" astringent tablets from the Sino-British Pharmacy. It radically cured his nocturnal emission, and he also took reproductive hormones to nourish himself. After about a month, the nocturnal emission was eradicated, and his essence and blood were full. He was like a different person before and after, he said.</p>
<p>(Note) There are more and more imitations of Hemet's Astringent Tablets on the market. Therefore, you must purchase astringent tablets with the "Hemet's" mark from a well-known pharmacy to avoid being deceived.</p>

<p>Must seek early treatment from a venereal disease expert.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and kidney atrophy are the most common conditions among venereal diseases. Many people suffer from them. The root cause is often caused by sexual neurasthenia. If not treated early, health will be lost, happiness will be non-existent, offspring will be hopeless, and longevity will be shortened. In recent years, medical science has flourished. Electrotherapy surgery and specific medicines can be used in combination. Patients should not hesitate and hesitate, and cause their own grief.</p>

<p>(Omitted above) I also suffered from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, and other conditions. My body was extremely weak. I have been married for many years and have not been able to have children. The feelings between husband and wife are indifferent. All the pleasures of life are gone. Three months ago, I was fortunate to have Dr. Zhan Nianceng perform electrotherapy surgery and use two famous medicines, Hemet's astringent tablets and Stanar's reproductive hormones, for about six weeks. All the symptoms were completely cured. (Omitted below) In addition to being grateful, I am sending a letter to express my gratitude and to inform those who suffer from the same disease.</p>

<p>Cao Jun Cai Liang is from Yuanhua. He is 43 years old. He has been addicted to opium for more than ten years. The reason for his addiction is that Cao Jun suffered from headaches and insomnia. All medicines were ineffective. He then followed his friend's advice and smoked to relieve the pain. Over time, his addiction deepened and it became more difficult to quit. He tried to quit several times due to various inconveniences, but stopped because his old illness recurred. Last fall, he was horrified by the government's ban and heard that his neighbor's insomnia and memory loss had been cured by me, so he sought treatment from me. I instructed him to purchase "reproductive hormones" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company. This would eliminate his smoking poison and smoking addiction and nourish his brain and revitalize his spirit. After taking it for a few days, he felt his mind was clear and healthy. After taking it for more than a month, his smoking addiction disappeared without a trace. Not only did he hate seeing smoke, but he was also strong and healthy, which he had never experienced before, he said.</p>

After careful examination, I realized that the astringent tablets I bought the second time were similar in decoration, but they were not Hemet's. I think it was a mistake. I hope your publication will publish this letter to avoid further errors.</p>
<p>(Answer) In recent years, there have been many imitations of Hemet's astringent tablets. You must purchase them from a famous pharmacy. 2. Please check carefully. Patients should pay attention to those with the Hemet's mark.</p>

<p>— (A Letter from Wang Juchu)</p>
<p>I used to be a strong and powerful person. I relied on my strong appetite and ate raw and cold foods that were not easily digested. I also did strenuous exercise after eating a full meal, which damaged my stomach and gradually caused symptoms such as stomach sluggishness and weakness. Since then, my body has gradually become weak. I was very distressed. Later, I submitted a letter to the Disease Q&amp;A column of this medical publication. I was told that "Digestive Tablets" could be effective. I bought them and took them according to the instructions. (Omitted below) Now I am healthier than ever before. But from now on, I will refrain from my previous habits and dare not eat raw and cold foods that are not easily digested.</p>

<p>(I) Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Atrophy Due to Weakened Youth Glands</p>
<p>Patient Wang Shaofei, 33 years old, from Benniu, is a businessman. Mr. Wang was poisoned by obscene books in his youth and mistakenly developed the bad habit of self-gratification, harming himself severely in the darkroom, resulting in significant depletion. He often felt headaches, dizziness, insomnia, forgetfulness, lower back pain, palpitations, and body tremors. He realized the harm and quit, but his youth glands had already been damaged. He suffered from spermatorrhea after marriage, and even worse, premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy, leading to weakened sexual function and a decline in vitality. He sought treatment everywhere without improvement. Only this spring, introduced by his colleague Mr. Ma, he came to me for treatment. I used the latest scientific surgical radio wave therapy and prescribed Ximituo's sperm-strengthening pills for his spermatorrhea. I instructed him to purchase and take Shengzhisu from Zhengwei Pharmacy to treat his weakened youth glands. After more than a month, all symptoms gradually disappeared and were completely cured. He became strong and healthy, with full muscles, sufficient blood, vigorous spirit, and lively energy, as if reborn.</p>
<p>(II) Different Medications for Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient Cheng Zhuo, 27 years old, from Yiwu, is in academia. Mr. Cheng was born with a weak constitution and a frail body. Due to his excellent social skills, he had many girlfriends. Indulging in these relationships without self-restraint led to spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. As a result, he became thin and weak, and his girlfriends gradually showed disdain. He felt deeply ashamed and developed neurasthenia. He sought treatment repeatedly without success, and his condition worsened. This autumn, he inquired around and came to me for treatment. I advised him on health preservation methods and applied electrical current to stimulate his nerve center. I also instructed him to purchase and take Ximituo's sperm-strengthening pills and Sizuoyou from Wuzhou Pharmacy. He immediately felt relief. After taking the medication for a few days, significant improvement was seen. He continued taking the medication for about five weeks. He felt his marrow full and sperm thick, his lower back strong, his sperm sufficient, and his spirit vigorous, with full muscles. He then realized the mistakes of his past actions.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is located on the second floor of the China Trust Company at the corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road. Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Quitting Smoking Cures Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Patient Jin Jiaju, 39 years old, from Nancheng, is a businessman. Mr. Jin was born with a weak constitution and had been sick since childhood. His health deteriorated after marriage. He suffered from kidney deficiency and lower back pain. He took various tonics, but they were all partially effective and failed to fully cure him. He experienced dizziness, blurred vision, palpitations, and body tremors, and his life became dull. He happened to visit a friend who was smoking opium and tried it at his suggestion. He seemed to feel invigorated, so he smoked it daily. He became addicted, and his spirit turned to decline. It was difficult to quit. He felt trapped and suffered greatly. He heard that a colleague had quit smoking after many years using "Shengzhisu" and asked him to introduce him to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase and take Shengzhisu from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company, two tablets three times a day, for more than two months. His smoking addiction was broken, and his kidney deficiency was completely cured. He felt light and healthy, as if freed from a cage.</p>
<p>Effective Treatment for Relaxed Sperm Gate</p>
<p>Patient Yang Ziyun, 24 years old, local, works in a certain organization. Eight or nine years ago, Mr. Yang was induced by bad friends to develop the bad habit of masturbation, harming himself severely and causing significant depletion. Five years ago, as he was about to get married, he unconsciously quit. However, this had already led to spermatorrhea. He took various medications without a complete cure. After marriage, the spermatorrhea did not diminish, his mind was depressed, and his energy was exhausted. He consulted doctors for recuperation, but it had no effect. He thought it was incurable and let it continue until late summer. He met Mr. Ma, who was like an old friend at first sight. They talked happily, and Mr. Ma mentioned his past experience with spermatorrhea and treatment by me. Mr. Yang asked him to introduce him to me for treatment. I observed that Mr. Yang's sperm gate was relaxed and prescribed a large amount of Ximituo's sperm-strengthening pills. After taking several boxes, he was completely cured. I also told Mr. Yang that his deficiency was severe and that without replenishment, his body would not be able to recover to health, and the spermatorrhea was likely to recur. I instructed him to purchase and take Shengzhisu from the Sino-Western Pharmacy for replenishment. After taking it, he became strong and healthy, like a completely different person.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Lifespan of the Laval Cabinet <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shouhe</p>
<p>Due to the development of the economic panic and the deepening of the financial crisis, the turbulence of French politics in recent years can be said to be more serious than that of any other country. In the past, most French cabinets collapsed within a few months, and some even died within two or three days of taking office. From this situation alone, it is conceivable how unstable the French political situation has been in recent years. Under such an unstable political situation, it has promoted the development of French political thought at both the left and right extremes and the sharpening of the struggle between the two. In fact, right-wing organizations in France, such as the Croix-de-Feu, composed of veteran soldiers, already have more than 300,000 members, and the Jeunesses Patriotes also have more than 325,000 members. In addition, organizations such as Action Française also have many members. At the same time, on the other hand, various left-wing parties in France, such as the Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, also have great strength. As a result, direct conflicts between the left and right extremes can be seen in places such as Paris almost at any time; moreover, various right-wing factions have formed a united organization to act in unison, and various left-wing parties have also united to form a "Popular Front" to confront the right-wing alliance. In this way, France, the so-called last bastion of democratic politics, is increasingly showing that it is difficult to maintain the lifespan of this democratic politics.</p>
<p>The Laval cabinet can be said to have emerged and been preserved in the struggle between the left and right extremes in France. However, due to the development of this struggle between the two extremes, the lifespan of the Laval cabinet is also increasingly in danger. In the last two or three months of last year, the Laval cabinet repeatedly encountered difficulties and faced danger several times. It can be said to be extremely fortunate that it has been able to maintain itself until now. Although the Laval cabinet has overcome several difficulties, according to general observation, its position is still not stable, and whether it can extend its lifespan to beyond January is still a big question. In order to examine the fate of the Laval cabinet in the future, it is necessary to review its recent encounters.</p>
<p>In November last year, France experienced a political crisis due to financial issues and the issue of banning the armed organizations of right-wing groups (i.e., the issue of protecting the republican system). When these two issues were raised in the Chamber of Deputies, the left-wing parties demanded that the latter be discussed first, while the government insisted that the former be discussed first. As a result, a conflict occurred, and they were unable to reach an agreement. The result was that many upper-level leaders of the Radical Socialist Party, such as Herriot, supported the Laval government, and the majority of the Chamber of Deputies agreed to discuss the financial issue first, and passed the government's financial plan in the Chamber of Deputies, allowing the Laval cabinet to overcome the first difficulty. As for why some upper-level leaders of the Radical Socialist Party supported the Laval cabinet on this issue, Herriot explained that: "If the current cabinet collapses, there are three possible solutions: one is to organize a 'Popular Front government', which would require dissolving the Chamber of Deputies; the second is for the Radical Party to form a cabinet alone, but under the current circumstances, no one in our party dares to take sole responsibility; the third is to organize a new cabinet similar to the current one, so why bother?" In other words, some upper-level leaders of the Radical Socialist Party are temporarily supporting the Laval cabinet because they are terrified of both the extreme left and the extreme right under the current circumstances, and they have no choice but to do so while wavering. Since then, the Laval cabinet has been able to escape danger time and again, all thanks to the rescue of Herriot and others.</p>
<p>After overcoming the first difficulty, the second difficulty encountered by the Laval cabinet was the issue of banning the armed organizations of right-wing groups. This issue was even more serious than the financial issue, because it was a question of determining victory or defeat on the first line of defense between the left and right sides. The banning of right-wing military organizations was not only strongly advocated by the extreme left, but also demanded by the vast majority of the Radical Socialist Party in the middle. At the same time, the right-wing groups were also unwilling to give in, and there was a great possibility of serious disturbances in places such as Paris. Therefore, Laval felt that the solution to the problem was very difficult and repeatedly delayed the discussion of the issue in order to find an opportunity to get out of danger. Sure enough, when the Chamber of Deputies debated this issue, Socialist leader Blum and Croix-de-Feu leader de la Rocque both stated that they were willing to dissolve the "defense organizations" in their parties. Laval immediately took the opportunity to propose a bill "prohibiting the placement of armed forces in parties." As a result, three bills were passed: The Minister of Interior may, after consulting with the State Council, dissolve military groups that endanger the security of the political system; those who illegally</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>possess weapons will be severely punished; those who publish radical remarks in the press aimed at instigating murder, even if it does not have any effect, their responsible persons may be submitted to the court for punishment. As a result, the Laval cabinet overcame the second difficulty. According to the bills passed by the Chamber of Deputies, Laval could simultaneously ban the armed organizations on both the left and right sides, so his overcoming the second difficulty was precisely a manifestation of his cunning.</p>
<p>However, the Laval cabinet was not stable after overcoming one difficulty after another. What followed was the Chamber of Deputies' discussion of foreign policy; this issue was triggered by the Anglo-French peace plan to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian War. After the Anglo-French peace plan was put forward, the world considered it an unfair plan. Whether in Paris, London, Geneva, or various small countries around the world, there was an atmosphere of opposition to this plan, causing the League of Nations under the control of Britain and France to reject this plan and causing British Foreign Secretary Hoare to step down. A similar serious reaction occurred in France. In this reaction, first, Herriot, a minister without portfolio who supported the Laval cabinet, was forced to resign as the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, and then the left-wing parties in the Chamber of Deputies opposed the government's diplomacy, making the fate of the Laval cabinet very dangerous. However, the result was also that a faction of upper-level leaders of the Radical Socialist Party were unwilling to start a cabinet crisis and decided to support the government. After Laval's "tongue-lashing of the Confucian scholars," the cabinet won again.</p>
<p>From the above facts, we can see that the lifespan of the Laval cabinet depends entirely on the support of some upper-level leaders of the Radical Socialist Party. Naturally, the wavering compromise of Socialist leader Blum and others can also be said to be a pillar of the Laval cabinet's existence, but mainly, if it were not for the strong support of Herriot and others, it would have collapsed long ago. We know that the Radical Socialist Party is the largest political party in France and occupies a pivotal position in the parliament. Although it has joined the "Popular Front," some of its leaders, such as Herriot, fear the extreme left more than they fear the extreme right, so they have to temporarily support the "moderate" Laval cabinet. How long the Laval cabinet's lifespan can be extended in the future, needless to say, will be determined by the strength of the Radical Socialist Party's support for it.</p>
<p>Currently, the political views of the French Radical Socialist Party are not unified. Some are increasingly approaching the right wing, while others are gradually moving to the left. If the conflict between the left and right extremes continues to develop in France, a serious division will inevitably occur within the Radical Socialist Party. In fact, the votes of the Radical Socialist Party's members of parliament were very inconsistent in the past parliamentary debates. If events develop to the point where neutral wavering is absolutely not allowed, then Herriot and others will be powerless even if they want to support the Laval cabinet.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, Laval is increasingly moving to the right, trying to extend his lifespan under the protection of the right wing and wavering elements. However, due to the unsolvable problem of the franc, the inability to overcome financial difficulties, and the irreconcilable struggle between the left and right extremes, the lifespan of the Laval cabinet is something that no insurance company in the world dares to insure.</p>
<p>If the Laval cabinet collapses, and if extreme politics of the left or right appears in France, the result will have a decisive effect on changes in the international situation.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Literature and War <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Xuqing</p>
<p>War, this is a very extraordinary change in human life. Due to the occurrence of war, all the equilibrium and order of society will be greatly damaged, and the ordinary lives of many groups of people cannot continue to be preserved. Therefore, all social culture cannot continue to adopt the law of gradual change and develop continuously in a normal state. Literature is also the same. In places where war occurs, there must be great changes. In fact, under the constant sound of machine guns, under the bombing of cannons, under the ruined homes, property, and the cries of people with injured bodies, under the symphony of the victor's triumphal songs and the loser's laments, any calm writer, any "surreal" poet, cannot but express their attitude towards war, and cannot but describe the thoughts and feelings of the people around them in the war.</p>
<p>When the World War from 1914 to 1918 occurred, whether in Germany, France, or Britain, all of Europe and even the whole world's literature was affected by the war. General writers created war-related works from their respective standpoints. Many literary researchers have divided modern literature into two stages: pre-war and post-war. This is an obvious fact. Now the world situation has become extremely tense, and everywhere is filled with the smell of gunpowder. No one can say for sure that war will break out tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Therefore, the changes that will occur in world literature and general culture are absolutely predictable. In order to predict the development and change patterns of literature in the future war, and in order to point out the path that literature should take at that time, we believe that it is necessary to explain the issue of literature and war; especially for the things of the last World War and literature that are closest to us, we must study it in more detail. The reason why we are writing this article is here.</p>
<p>Although war has a great effect on every writer's creation, because each writer's life and world view are different, their feelings about war are also different. For example, in the last World War, writers from all over the world, some were from the standpoint of patriotism to encourage war, some sang the songs of humanitarianism or conservatism in the war, some took the description of people's suffering in the war as their own task, some opposed war and negated everything from the standpoint of extreme individualism, and some actually described the real situation of the war, or even further opposed war from the standpoint of social evolution. In this way, there were a wide variety of them, you name it, we have it, it can be said to be "a dazzling array." Now, in order to understand the problem more clearly, we can also briefly discuss several major literary tendencies in the last World War.</p>
<p>First of all, what deserves our attention is patriotic war literature. According to statistics, in the first year of the outbreak of the war, there were as many as 1.5 million kinds of patriotic poems in Germany alone; the declaration signed by 93 artists and thinkers such as Hauptmann and Döblin and Wassermann, "Why Can't We Not Fight?", is a world-known expression of defending war ideology and militarism. In addition, in countries such as Britain and France, so-called patriotic war literature was also very popular in the early stages of the war, although it was far less fanatical than in Germany. In fact, the banning of Shaw's war satire in Britain at that time, and Romain Rolland's expulsion from France because of his opposition to the war and intolerance by French patriots, the opposite significance of these two things was the high tide of patriotic thought in Britain and France at that time; because if Britain and France were not enthusiastic about patriotism at that time, Shaw and Romain Rolland would not have suffered such treatment.</p>
<p>The second is the tendency of conservatism and humanitarianism that occurred in the war. For example, the humanism represented by Babbitt and More in the United States is a kind of conservatism. They also "oppose" war, and Babbitt himself has specifically protested against the declaration of Hauptmann and others defending the war, but they believe that the cause of the war is due to the excessive development of Rousseau's liberalism and Bacon's scientific thought, so their opposition to war is against material civilization, "overthrowing scientific despotism," and wanting to revive the Eastern "doctrine of the mean" to stabilize the world. This kind of "anti-war" tendency is not to push the world forward, but to try to restore the world to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries or even the Middle Ages; in the realistic sense, it is used to preserve the conservatism of the real world. As for humanitarian literature, because the war has created a cruel picture of the world, so this is even more popular in the development process of the war, such as Kuprin's "The Garden of the Holy Virgin" in Russia, Lagerlöf's "The Outcast" in Sweden, and even some works by Hauptmann in Germany, can be said to be humanitarian, Ibanez's "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and "The Mediterranean" in Spain are also sad literary works wearing the cloak of humanitarianism. In his work, there is such a rather pleasant sentence: "Since we are born, everyone has the right to live. The rich, the poor, the strong, the weak, the large, the small, the old, the young, everyone has the right to live. The purpose of our birth is not for others to kill us one day, nor to kill each other, fight each other, and finally kill ourselves. ..." This is a rather touching humanitarian rhetoric.</p>
<p>In addition, in the war and after the end of the war, there are also literary works in the world that express the despair of intellectuals, there are novels and dramas that describe the horror of war and completely oppose war, there are also futurists who shout "Long live the war" and Dadaists who "spit on everything" appear, ... Due to space limitations, we cannot list them all in detail here. However, among them, such as Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" describing the horror of war, Shaw and Rolland and Barbusse's anti-war works are the most influential in the current world literature, and have opened up new paths for war literature, so their works deserve special study by those who study modern world literature or study war literature to read them carefully. In that middle (such as in "All Quiet on the Western Front", in Latzko's "Men in War" and Barbusse's "Under Fire"), you can see the cruel and real pictures of war, and you can also think about how to eliminate war and move towards the path of light. Naturally, there are also many shortcomings in their war literature, such as Shaw's "Killing Instinct", Latzko's absolute "pacifism", and Rolland's humanitarian tendencies, which can be said to be somewhat incorrect. But when we study modern literature, especially when studying war literature, they are still worthy of special attention.</p>
<p>The above is a brief narrative of the issue of the last World War and world literature. Now, the Second World War has become a reality again. Although we cannot say that history will be completely replayed, although we cannot say that the changes that will occur in world literature when a new war occurs will be the same as the changes that occurred in literature in the last World War, we know that human imitation is the strongest. If people living in reality find something that is beneficial to them in the past history, they will definitely follow suit and revive that thing. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to think that when a new war occurs, patriotic literature that defends war, conservatism that fundamentally opposes material civilization due to war, and humanitarianism that cries and begs for mercy for war, all have the possibility of reappearing in new forms. Moreover, in fact, there are now some official intellectuals who are advocating and helping the war of aggression. A very obvious example is Marconi's efforts in the work of aggression in Abyssinia. The futurists who regard war as "the best hygiene" are still enthusiastically welcoming the arrival of the god of war. Once the world war breaks out widely, these official intellectuals do not know how they will dance wildly before the god of war!</p>
<p>If literature is not a pastime, if it still has some effect, then this effect should be to seek welfare for human society at that time. War is cruel, it destroys human life and destroys human life. If literature must undergo great changes in and before the war, then good literature should oppose war and oppose the literature that defends war for the happiness of mankind. But this opposition is not to fundamentally overthrow all material civilization, to make people return to the Middle Ages, that is conservative, and even reversing; this opposition should be standing in a progressive position, actively eliminating the social factors that produce war, so that material civilization can be more highly developed, so that mankind is more happy. At the same time, opposing war is not effective by humanitarian crying and begging for mercy, but to oppose war with the power to fundamentally eliminate war. For example, the wars of colonial and semi-colonial countries for independence and liberation are against the imperialists who are the masters of the current world, and therefore are also a progressive war that fundamentally eliminates war. Good literature should support and praise this progressive war. In the war, excellent writers should say to everyone: "The people are fighting for a few people. The few people are - corpse-eating ghosts who get fat from war!" At the same time, excellent writers should also use the power of literature to awaken weak nations and truly anti-war groups to resist those "corpse-eating ghosts who get fat from war" and fundamentally eliminate war.</p>

<h3 id="e224">The "Old Customer" of the Fresh Goods Depot <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Near Shenyang Railway Station, there are over thirty fresh goods depots, accommodating approximately over two thousand "old customers," all stationed here by various merchant firms on a regular basis.</p>
<p>These "old customers," regularly "stationed" at the depots, not only procure goods for their respective stores but also extensively promote and solicit business for their stores' products; their responsibilities are no less burdensome than those of a plenipotentiary ambassador stationed abroad. Their daily work is similar to that of ambassadors and ministers, reporting local market conditions to their stores and employing commercial skills to negotiate with major markets. Therefore, the prosperity and decline of a store's business is entirely in the hands of these "old customers."</p>
<p>Becoming an "old customer" is not easy. Most start as apprentices, requiring extensive commercial experience, proficiency in abacus calculation, skillful eloquence, and a courteous demeanor. Whenever we stroll through the many depots in Toudaogou near the station, we can always see three to five "old customers" with smiling faces (perhaps forced) negotiating deals with customers in courtyards stacked with goods. Their humble attitude makes you want to do business with them immediately.</p>
<p>Most of the people who act as "old customers" here are from Leting, Changli, and Luanzhou. Even in Changchun, those who dominate commerce are mostly their fellow townsmen. Therefore, "old customers" who speak the dialects of Leting, Changli, and Luanzhou have a significant advantage in transactions. However, due to the intrusion of Japanese commercial capital, which has weakened the commercial influence of Leting, Changli, and Luanzhou, these "old fellow townsmen" "old customers" can no longer live as comfortably as before.</p>
<p>As for the private lives of "old customers," they are quite interesting. Although they handle transactions involving millions of dollars annually, it is difficult to find a writing desk in their offices. They conduct business negotiations mostly on mahjong tables or beside opium beds. No matter how large the transaction, it can be decided with a word in such places. Others negotiate in teahouses. Strangely, in Shenyang, playing cards and smoking opium are quite common. Therefore, the daily routine of a typical "old customer" can be divided into two parts. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, they are busy with the abacus, shipping and receiving goods, thoroughly enjoying themselves. After lunch at twelve o'clock, it is time for leisure, which can also be said to be the start of new business negotiations. As soon as the mahjong table is set up in the depot, the "old customers" entering and leaving the depot will sit down without invitation, talking and playing mahjong, discussing everything from world affairs to personal lives, casually leading to serious topics, and then getting down to business. Their deals are all concluded in this casual manner. A large-scale depot has at least a dozen mahjong tables every day, no less than a club. The gambling stakes are also high, but they don't care about losing a little money on mahjong as long as they get a good price for a batch of goods. This only describes a portion of the older "old customers," who, due to their age, are unwilling to move around. There is also a group of young "old customers," whose minds are as numb as those of the older "old customers." Their preference is mostly for prostitutes rather than opium, frequenting brothels.</p>
<p>The salary of an "old customer," generally speaking, is about three to four hundred dollars per year, but no one can say for sure. Because nine out of ten "old customers" engage in some personal trading, there is no fixed rule for how much money they earn each day. Moreover, many "old customers" are themselves bosses, so it is difficult to compile statistics on their income. Furthermore, an "old customer," whether doing export or import business, can always manipulate prices. If the exported goods sell at a high price, they pocket a portion of the profit; if the imported goods are purchased at a low price, they can secretly increase the price. The store gives them full authority and does not interfere. Therefore, if an "old customer" is slightly disloyal to the store, the store will inevitably close down. The longevity of a store is in the hands of the "old customers" stationed abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e225">### New Year's Message <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Time flies, days and months do not linger. In the blink of an eye, the Republic of China's twenty-fourth year has quietly passed amidst our sighs, laments, moans, and cries. Looking back, we do not know where our tears come from; looking forward, we try to smile but cannot! With national crises looming and human affairs deteriorating, we are filled with a myriad of emotions as the new year begins. Realizing that endless pessimism is of no practical help, we must think about how to resolve ourselves and work diligently in the coming years. Thus, I offer this "New Year's Message."</p>
<p>1. Expectations for Administrative Personnel: The foundation of a nation's politics lies in local autonomy. Therefore, to ensure the stability of the nation's foundation, we must first strive to complete local autonomy. But to achieve local autonomy, we must first train the people. However, it has been more than five years since political tutelage began. Has the work of political tutelage reached perfection without any shortcomings? Can the current officials in charge of political tutelage be said to be blameless before the world? Alas! It is better not to speak, as discussing it inevitably leads to lament. There are many administrative organs and personnel today, but upon closer inspection, some sit idly, wasting resources, signing in under false pretenses, and spending their days in leisure; others bury themselves at their desks, working endlessly on official documents, only knowing "because of this, therefore," and never asking about practical matters, focusing on reimbursement for superiors, earning a living for themselves, deceiving others as a means, and being perfunctory to subordinates, spending their spare time uttering official platitudes to entertain themselves, and when idle, putting on official airs to impress others. With facts like these, the results are predictable. Thus, the people who have been "trained" for so long remain the same year after year, and the local affairs that have been "governed" for so long remain unchanged. Since the engine of political action is a complete mess, the so-called achievements of political tutelage are nothing more than empty talk on paper. With such political tutelage, when will the nation's foundation be laid, and when will the nation have a chance to be saved?</p>

<p>Realizing that governance does not require much talk, and that resolution is paramount in administration, and with national crises escalating and the situation being dire, as we approach the end of the year and welcome the new, learning from past mistakes and deeply regretting past follies, and renewing ourselves with a fresh start for future efforts, for the sake of the nation and the people, we dare to offer our humble advice to all administrative personnel: "Starting from the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, please abandon your 'accumulated habits' and 'lethargy,' embrace the vitality and enthusiasm of the New Year, revitalize your spirits, fulfill your missions, delve deep into the people, diligently seek out their grievances, actively carry out both necessary and revolutionary measures, base all internal and external policies on the will of the people, strive for efficiency in political tutelage, avoid formalism, avoid grand displays, abolish slogans and mottos, resolve to work hard diligently, do not deceive yourselves or others, do not be complacent, enter the new year, create a new life, the past is like smoke, useless to talk about, the future is long, let us work together."</p>
<p>2. Expectations for Youth: Youth is the most precious period of life, and vibrant youth is a true reflection of ourselves. Youth is also the backbone of the nation. If a solid foundation is not laid in youth, the edifice of future careers will inevitably be impossible to build upward. But, young people, in this season of renewal, try to examine yourselves in the stillness of the night, can you be without shame before yourselves, your parents, your teachers, and your nation? Of course, there are those who are acutely aware of the importance of individual responsibility and the urgent need for talent in the future of the nation, and who diligently encourage themselves and strive without ceasing, but there are also those who fail to live up to the expectations of their parents and teachers, squandering their parents' hard-earned money, pursuing sensual pleasures, loitering in dance halls, ignorant of science, and getting headaches from books. They are vaguely aware of world affairs, don't care about national affairs, are satisfied with obtaining diplomas, and aim to become high officials after graduation. There are even more of these. May I ask, how can the nation's hope be placed on such people? If the life of our dying nation does not perish in their hands, when will it perish?</p>
<p>Oh, our youth, as brilliant as the morning sun! At this juncture, may I not offer a word of sincere advice? I say: "The past cannot be undone, but the future can still be pursued. From the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, determine your bright outlook on life, recognize your correct path, cultivate your progressive thoughts, and strive with all your might for the people, the nation, the family, and yourselves, and step onto the great path of life. To save the nation, one must first strengthen the body; to resist the enemy, one must strengthen national defense. In addition to material national defense, spiritual national defense relies on the flourishing of science and the daily progress of culture. May I ask, have our minds been rigorously trained? Intelligent young people should be able to infer the rest from these, without the need for further elaboration. Masters of the nation's future, please take good care of yourselves!"</p>
<p>3. Expectations for Other Publications: The prosperity of a nation relies on the collective efforts of the people, and individual success or failure is only a personal matter, but when a nation prospers or declines, no one can shirk their responsibility. Recalling the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, warlords ran rampant, and politicians caused chaos, leading to the downfall of the nation and the suffering of the people. Recently, imperialists have intensified their actions to infringe upon China, leading to the daily diminishing of our territory and the increasingly severe national crisis, which is beyond our ability to foresee. However, the people of our country are usually lazy to improve themselves, muddle-headed, and do not prepare for the unexpected, so that when things happen, they cannot be resolved. Following the Spring and Autumn Annals' tradition of criticizing the worthy, the people's guilt seems difficult to avoid being judged by future generations.</p>
<p>Now the New Year of the twenty-fifth year has quietly arrived amidst our heart-wrenching and tearful days. Looking ahead, we are even more pained! And our hopes for people from all walks of life are particularly earnest. We say: "Please, people from all walks of life, harbor a sense of danger like walking on thin ice, and starting from this New Year's Day of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, make saving the country the only constant goal of your lives, and make firm resolutions. How should we revitalize industry and increase production to strengthen the nation? How should we educate the people and promote the principles of saving the country to awaken the people? How should we develop wasteland and connect waterways to benefit the masses? How should we...? All people from all walks of life should keep these 'how should we' questions in mind, go their separate ways, and fulfill their respective responsibilities. In the future, different paths will converge to form a strong foundation for saving the country. With this, what enemy cannot be destroyed? With this, what country cannot be saved? Oh, our loyal comrades from all walks of life, the time is critical, the situation is dangerous! If we do not catch up quickly, it will be too late!"</p>

<h3 id="e226">Black Slaves <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Changren</p>
<p>Correspondence from the Capital of Abyssinia</p>
<p>The most prevalent place for the slave trade in Africa is the Slave Coast. From the Niger River to Walvis Bay, its port of export is Luanda. The number of slaves transported from Luanda is truly numerous, like "carp crossing the river," but because the slave trade is a clandestine business, the exact numbers are impossible to count. The slaves exported from Luanda are mostly transported to Southern Europe, the central and northern parts of North America, and South America to work in mining and farming, living a subhuman life that is worse than that of cattle. The masters' treatment of the slaves consists only of providing basic sustenance, without any monetary compensation. Moreover, the sustenance provided is crude and insufficient, sometimes not even allowing them to eat their fill of the crudest foods. At night, to prevent them from escaping, the masters would rivet shackles on each person's feet, chaining dozens or several people together. Sometimes, when one person had to get up, everyone else would have to get up as well. This kind of restraint is stricter than that of a murderer. Therefore, among those who are sold into slavery, it is difficult for even one out of a thousand to survive.</p>
<p>There is a type of black people called Little Negro, an uncivilized tribe that still practices fetishism. Their national character is extremely fierce, but because they are as foolish as deer, they are easily deceived. Therefore, among the slaves that are transported and sold, nine out of ten belong to them. Even in the African mainland, they are often sold among themselves.</p>
<p>The Little Negroes in the Cameroon Mountains and the Adamawa Plateau live a life that has not departed from that of primitive humans. Each person's living tools consist of only a bow and arrow, and nothing else. With that sharp weapon, they can easily survive for decades. Every day, carrying a bow and arrow, they leap and dart like monkeys over mountains and ridges, searching for food. When they encounter wild animals or lone travelers, they treat them as objects of hunting and robbery. However, once they are transported and sold as slaves, they become as tame as sheep.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also many uncivilized tribes in northeastern Africa. They sell their children into slavery to do those heavy and strenuous jobs for others. When they reach seventeen or eighteen years old, they will be resold to distant places to reclaim wasteland, enduring drifting and wandering, and living a subhuman life. After being bought and enslaved, all his human rights belong to the master. If he accidentally offends the master, he may be flogged. Even if he is beaten to death by the master, the law will not have any sympathetic judgment. "Humanitarianism" is difficult to explain in slave circles. In some places, there is even a customary law that "killing a slave is not punishable by death and is not a crime."</p>
<p>The selling price of a little black slave is truly unbelievable. It is said that little black slaves aged nine to eleven are only worth about two silver dollars. Therefore, many whites who live in Africa love to buy such little black slaves to serve them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, along the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the East African coast, many black people are sold into slavery. They spend their whole days doing heavy and dangerous work for their masters until death or disability, without any compensation. There is also a type of young woman who is transported to various prosperous ports to satisfy the sexual desires of sailors and tea boys, and the price they get is unbelievably low. They are nicknamed Blackstone. After living such a life, when they reach a certain age, they sell a few little black female slaves to continue their lives of prostitution. In Suakin, Berber, and Port Sudan, as soon as the ship docks, you can easily see many barefoot, naked, and prostituting black female slaves with a red and green shawl draped over their shoulders.</p>

<p>— Puyü</p>
<p>The old man looked at me in alarm, then suddenly ran over frantically and pried open my hand, shouting in a voice like a broken gong: "I always knew what your 'official business' was!" The old man's throat was bulging, and he pounded his chest violently. "He's extorting money, he's oppressing the common people. Today official business, tomorrow official business, our calculations are all..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish, I slapped him in the face. The old man used all his strength to catch the slap, pushing me away so hard that I almost fell.</p>
<p>The old man was excessively exhausted, his face showing the color of death. His right hand trembled as he pointed at me, his voice weak and feeble: "You harmful people, I..." He dragged his stiff body towards me, but stumbled and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Just as I was alarmed, several apprentices rushed in, supporting the old man while shouting: "You're driving people to their deaths! You're killing people! Beat him, beat that bastard!..."</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the chaos, I slipped out of the accounting room. By the time the second "Beat that..." reached my ears, I had already fled out the door! Just as I ran to the corner of the left wall, that kid Jiang Xiwu turned around and said: "Director, that was close!"</p>
<p>I wiped away a cold sweat and cursed heavily: "Damn bastard, only cares about himself!" (The End)</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Recently, I learned that a gentleman in the broadcasting world who shares the editor's surname and given name is involved in a love affair. This reminds me that some time ago, a reader wrote to inquire whether the editor was running a singing group. At the time, I thought it was hearsay and did not reply. It turns out that it was a real case. Now, I have seen my name widely publicized in certain broadcasting publications. I can assure you that I do not possess such "romantic" charm, and I hereby declare that it is not me.</p>

<p>Since "Triumphant Song" premiered at the Golden City Theater, it has been praised not only for its realistic and tragic themes but also for its magnificent scenes and skillful techniques. Therefore, it is no wonder that it has received overwhelming praise, and it is widely regarded as the first great masterpiece in the history of Chinese films. As a result, the entrance of the Golden City Theater has been bustling with carriages and horses every day, and the popularity has been unprecedented. The fame of "Triumphant Song" has a sense of sweeping across the land. The picture on the left shows the lead actors Wang Yin and Qin Tong.</p>
<h3 id="e231">China Film Society for Renewal Holds Membership Recruitment Meeting <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Since the China Film Society for Renewal first began recruiting male and female members, a large number of people have joined. Now, in order to further expand, it will hold a membership recruitment meeting starting today. It is divided into more than forty teams, with Chang Shaobai as the general captain, and the remaining teams are led by the members themselves. Those with excellent performance will be awarded prizes (the top three will be awarded silver shields). Anyone who loves film and drama, regardless of gender, can join. Because the original address is insufficient, it has been moved from the original address (Room 407, Taihe Building, Lloyd Road) to Room 204 on the second floor, still in Taihe Building on Lloyd Road. The new address has sufficient light and ample space. In the future, those who want to join or have matters to discuss can go to the new address listed above.</p>

<p>— Zhi'er</p>
<p>"Annual custom," it seems that one always has to write something about hope for the New Year, although these hopes can be typeset and printed annually, but one cannot be without hope.</p>
<p>For example, the Chinese film industry in 1935 passed through storms. 1936 may not see a turn for the better; however, hope is hope, that quality will improve month by month, and that output can increase.</p>
<p>As for whether it is implemented or not, that does not seem to have much to do with hope.</p>
<p>A certain newspaper, "Fragments," relayed: "But when all film companies are caught in the midst of 'no rice to cook,' it is a bit unrealistic to ask people to shoot new films."</p>
<p>The Chinese film industry in 1935 "a vigorous and stirring national salvation movement." After this article, I finally understood that there were brilliant people who knew the current affairs and were serving the times. My respects!</p>
<p>Really, the students who save the nation, why haven't they obediently returned to the classroom? Isn't the current situation in China all caught in the midst of "no rice to cook"? It is truly "extremely unrealistic"!</p>
