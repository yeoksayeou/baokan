<h3 id="c64">奧國的悲劇 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>據前日奧京維也納電訊。奧內閣舉行非常會議。已以最大權限授與總理許士尼格。造成許氏個人唯一的獨裁。同時內衛團及其他政治軍事性質的團體。均被解散。內衛團頒袖斯泰侖堡親王已亡命出外。結束共政治的生命。這重要的變化。似乎已把數月來或數年來奧國內部的糾紛。吿一段落。今後在中歐這一塊衝要的土地上。或可有比較安定的局面。不過我們把奧國的內政外交情形加以更深的考察。則會威覺到介於兩個法西斯野心國家中間的奧地利。假若他沒有一個獨立自主的內政外交政策。則他終不免於俯仰由人。成為侵略者鬥爭的犧牲品。換言之他的命運將永遠是一個悲劇。</p>
<p>自然。我們追溯歷史。知道大戰以來的奧國。疆土大削。經濟命運操諸英法的掌握。早就陷在一種悲劇的遭遇中。不過我們更會看到。奧國的更大的悲劇。是在一九三四年開始的。原來戰後的奧國。由社會黨執政。雖然實行的是不澈底的社會政策。但比之西歐的資本主義各國。究竟已進步許多。特別是維也納的工人宿舍。造福於五十萬的平民。在國際間博得非常的好評。但因此就引起意國的嫉忌。一九三四年二。月以一小拿破侖」自號的陶爾斐斯。以國際法西斯為背景。消滅社會黨。造成獨裁的局面。但陶氏勢力的擴大。又引起德國國社黨的顧忌。同年六月維也納發生國社黨政變。陶氏也慘遭殺死不過國社黨勢力的伸入奧國。英法與意國都不干休。於是國社黨雖殺死了陶氏。而政變並沒有成功。這時候。英法乃扶出了他們所屬意的許士尼格。維持獨立的局面。而意國則以斯泰侖堡親王為工具。加强他的半法西斯性質的內衛團的力量。儼然成為半殖民地的奧國的保護者。這樣錯綜複雜的局面。由於國社黨威脅的嚴重。法意的矛盾轉變而成諒解。居然維持了近兩年光景。但奧國的獨立僅為形式上的東西。他的內外政策都要聽命於實際的支配者。則為舉世皆知的事實。最顯然者。國聯决議對意施行制裁。奧國懾於强鄰的淫威。竟不敢參加半。殖民地國家喪失外交的自主權。由此可見一斑。</p>
<p>本年七月十一日德奧妥恊約成立。實際上也是意國主動的。這種談判的進行。還是六月五日慕沙里尼召喚許士尼格到洛卡別墅親自示意的結果。至於斯泰侖堡親王的失勢。則更可見半殖民地國家內政上沒有自主權的慘果。原來斯氏的得勢。是由於意國的要把他利用。但最近斯氏忽有個人的野心。希望成為奧國復辟後的攝政者。這引起了意國的嫌惡。於是許士尼格就利用機會。把失了寵的斯氏排斥了。不過現在奧國的內閣。由於德奧妥協的結果。國社黨的勢力已逐漸增强。許氏本身命運的不可靠。正與斯氏一樣。而意德兩個法西斯野心國家對於奧國問題的妥恊。不久也終必要破裂。恢復原來的尖銳鬥爭的。</p>
<p>總之。從目前奧國的政局變化中。我們看到的始終是一個半殖民地國家不向獨立自由道路去鬥爭而造成的悲劇。我國目前正立在這樣的歧路上。我們也當以奧國的敎訓為殷鑒。</p>

<p>粵人楊文道·葉海生·周社榮、被公共租界捕房起訴於去年十一月九日在竇樂安路槍殺日水兵中山秀雄一案、業經特一法院審判、楊·葉·各處死刑、周無罪、自此案判决後·楊·葉·已分別提起上訴於高二分院、而關於周社榮部份、捕房已確定不再上訴、昨晨、由捕房律師汝葆彝向特一法院錢鴻業刑庭長聲明對周捨棄上訴、請卽予開釋、經錢庭長諭令周社榮開釋、葉海生之上訴書、已誌本報、楊文道則由其妻唐氏委託唐懷羣律師為其夫楊文道撰上訴理由書、亦於昨晨呈高二分院、請求撤銷原判、宣吿楊文道無罪、原狀如下、</p>
<p>上訴人楊文道為二十四年度訴工字第　八九三號、工部局狄司威路捕房、訴楊文通謀殺日水兵中山秀雄一案、不服第一審判决、呈請上訴並補具理由事、查本案經奉第一特區地方法院判决楊文道以殺害日水兵中山秀雄論罪、處以死刑、業已依限聲明不服、提起上訴在案、嗣以研究本案判决書內容、其所遽以論斷楊文道之罪刑部份者、厥為根據兩點、（一）挖槍形洞之物理書一本、（二）葉海生之自白、然此兩點是否能作論罪之基礎、核以歷次庭訊之情形及事實之旁證、誠屬一極大之寃獄、而有待於分別申辯陳述者、</p>
<p>關於槍形洞之書</p>
<p>查楊文道於被捕之後，雖於四月二十日當庭承認此捕房所呈案之挖槍洞之物理書、係屬所有、但於同月二十七日則復稱該書並非所有、以前另有一本等語、前者坦白無慮若是、後者初衷倏變如此、不注意事實者、能母不疑其狡滑、尤認定該書為犯罪之鐵證耶、但將無論過去與現在情形一經研討之結果、遂可不剖而自明、（蓋楊文道在民國二十二年因有向友人李暮借得手槍一支、曾向工部局照章領照、以作自衛之用、乃家中小孩太多、誠恐為彼等玩弄而發生危險、經其堂侄楊建忠敎其以書挖洞藏置之方法後、當卽以一英文物理書照製而藏之、嗣後該槍交還、書遂無用而棄置、一聽其孩童玩弄、迨被捕之翌日、捕房在其家搜得其書領回捕房、雖未發問、而楊文道卽稱該書係其所有、（西副探長克勞德之報吿）可見在楊文道認此齊之本無足輕重、復於四月二十日當庭自承、顯見其坦白之心跡、苟該書果屬搆成犯罪行為者、非特無久藏家中之理、亦無直認為已所有之愚、是以該書之來歷、固不得不追查其因素、故楊文道對該書前者之自承、與乎後者之謂係其堂侄楊建忠之栽拋、責大有研究焉、至查四月二十日僅係捕房聲讀羈押、緣非本案審理、其在詢問楊文道時、亦僅就案桌持書相詢、並未交閱、（呈案之書雖係中文譯本、但其形色與英文原本頗相類似、）初不料更有如此之巧合、因未加細視、卽行承認、（查五月九日筆錄第二九頁載　原審楊文道稱、「太遠了、我看不淸楚」亦何足怪、而所謂栽拋由於其堂侄楊建忠所為一語、薔楊建忠之品行惡劣、兇悍成性、素為其鄉黨友朋所盡知、果加密訪偵查、不難詳細在楊文道被捕之前數日、曾突由其同族楊桂梅者、吿以涉有某種嫌疑、　速逃避、楊文道追究此語來歷時、則稱係楊建忠所轉囑、迨楊文道急欲拽其以晤楊建忠，遂支吾不能答、常被楊文道怒批其頰而去、此事之經過在先、是楊建忠對於此案實有預謀之可能、加以事後證人張琛之供詞與捕房提出之證人會元·鄭平山等之互相淵源、（詳張志讓律師代撰葉海生上訴理由狀）楊建忠栽贓陷害、蛛絲馬跡、亦非無因、但據取具楊建忠之指紋及掌紋交法醫研究所檢查、經其詳細比對在送檢之指紋及掌內、未能撿見與書內殘留指印相似之紋路、故認稱楊建忠陷害一點為無可採取、大凡拋贓陷害者、亦贓物上是否必須有其手紋與掌紋始可證斷、姑置而勿辯、但該書旣屬久置於楊文道家中者、何以法醫研究所經原審法院之囑託、將楊文道之指紋及掌紋、與該書內發見之各指紋相核對、反覆檢查、並未見有相似之處、且書內留有血指痕亦與楊文道指掌之紋路不符、（均見該所各騐查醫）試問有此理乎、而原審法院對此重要問題置之不顧、非特認定事實、顯屬錯誤、衡以該書無楊建忠手指紋判斷一節、更欠公允、更進一步言、呈案之臀、所據法醫研究所檢查內密報吿各節、果如足使各頁之汚舊及壓痕之深、何則使用歷時許久洞內切痕尚能如此整齊簇新、其屬不可能、亦人所盡知、原審不予注意、令人費解、若以此呈案挖槍洞書卽遽為楊文道論罪之證據者要皆不合情理、槪可想見、</p>
<p>關於葉海生自白</p>
<p>葉海生自白、歷决庭訊、前後矛盾、俱見筆錄、言不由衷、更可斷定、（幷詳張志讓律師代撰上訴狀內）是其遷涉於楊文道各節益不是信、况楊文道自始至終、從未承認葉海生所供及謀殺之事實、卽葉所供常時並有高麗人傑克參與此謀、然當庭質之傑克與楊文道並不認識、倘果係議謀共同殺人事件、其重要絕非可與一不相識者所能為、故本案情形之複雜、內幕之黑暗、奚能認定葉海生自白中之遷涉於楊文道者、而作論罪之基礎、是非寃獄母庸贅言、獨原審法院對於被吿有利證據一概抹煞實欠斟酌、粽上事實與理由、可知本案之發生、全係僞證鄭平山。曾元·張　之·楊建忠等為一有組織圖當陷害之寃獄、日水兵中山番雄之死、實與被吿楊文道奄無關係、除本案所　申辯理由已經張　讓律師先為第二被吿葉海生撰狀詳述不予縷陳外、為此呈請鈞長俯念恩准、祥賜密理、撤銷原釗、依法諭知楊文道部份無罪同釋、以仲寃獄、生死人而肉白骨、實為德便、謹狀、江蘇高等第　分院公鑒、具狀人楊文道妻楊唐氏、撰狀律師唐懷羣、</p>

<p>— 胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>九、敎師修養</p>
<p>日本學校中的敎師均稱職員；因為他們認為敎師也是一種職官。關於敎師的修養，校中頗為注重。校中設有各科研究部，由校長指派主任及部員若干人，時常舉行研究會。在相當時期舉行學生的成績考查，可使敎師對於敎學的效果以及取材的適當與否知所反省。在紀念日校中敎師輪流向兒童演講；遇有校外名人到校演購時，敎師亦參加聽講。</p>
<p>敎師的進修會有五種。全體敎職員會每星期開會一次，由校長主席，討論重要校務。敎學法研究會，開會無定期，討論關於敎學的理論與實際問題。日本國內暑期講習會，敎師亦須輪流參加，將來回校時須向其他敎帥報吿。學年會是由各學年擔任訓導的敎師參加，澈底討論敎學的材料和訓育養護諸問題。讀書發表會常常舉行，由各敎師互相報吿閱讀圖書的內容。</p>
<p>另外敎師還有校外參觀，由校長指定參觀的學校，或由敎師建議經校長核准。有時，校長可指派敎師出外視察各方面新的設施，回校時作成視察的報吿。敎師亦可到各種會社，工塲，或研究所去見學敎授的方法和搜集參考的資料。敎師亦時常舉行運動，如網球，棒球，乒乓球，排球等，以增進身體的健康。</p>

<p>— 李惠堂</p>
<p>這位熱烈關懷我們足球隊的僑胞的啟迪、委實令我們非常紉感、同時也加壯了我們不少的膽汁、增長了我們無限的銳氣、我們知道比較上大家初次對壘、我們至少佔些便宜、這便時我們深曉英人球隊的踢法和戰略、而英隊對我們這東方球隊、却茫茫然一無所知、</p>
<p>七月二十九日英國隊到了、他們的宿舍、離我們的不過一箭之路、我一找着機會、便和他的敎練接談、我先調查他們的來歷、他說隊中有四人是來自蘇格蘭的GreenPark隊、（加入蘇之職業甲組賽之唯一業餘隊）有九人是分隸於英之著名業餘隊Casuals和Corinthians兩會、其他的球員、都是由愛爾蘭及威爾士各業餘國際選手隊事選拔出來的、他又說他們本來不要參加的、到最後才决定派隊、所以事前缺少訓練、現在隊員中彼此全不認識姓名的很多、瞭解方面、恐怕還嬰趕快地下點苦功罷、這樣一來、我知到這一回的英國隊、是英格蘭蘇格蘭愛爾蘭威爾士四部合攏着、而並非單獨英格蘭的實力、把各地的優秀份子凝結起來、戰鬬力當然很利害、不過我們是經過長期訓練和合作的、他們彼此連人都不認識、這也是我們一點小便宜、賽前的幾天、每遇他們練習、我都偷偷地去觀察他們的强弱、他們的脚法、平均上比我們好、蹴球也比我們有力、身軀比我們碩大、氣力比我們充足、單就這幾點看來、我們也不大容易應付了、他們到了柏林後、也很小心警惕地不的友誼比賽、所以他們所採的戰略、是無由考查、但無論如何、我們在絕望中、仍抱着一綫的曙光、絕對未完全表示灰心喪志、</p>
<p>大會開幕了、距賽期還有六天、除了參觀田徑和足球外、眞有度日如年之苦、我們在南洋一帶習慣了一星期最少三次或三次以上的比賽、雖然辛苦、但也習以為常、這一次休養着不賽球已有二十多日了、委實有點內心的不舒服、而且晚間老是不能酣睡、眼巴巴望着賽期的來臨、我們全隊、都犯着「過度思慮」Over　Anxiety的毛病、這不良的心理恐怕也是失敗原因中之一、</p>
<p>韶光如輪轉、不覺又是八月六日了、我們經過狠審愼和密切的商榷、才把左列的陣容擺出來、</p>

<p>那天我們選手團、除了要參加旁的運動者外、餘人都全體到齊觀戰、柏林的華僑、亦掃數臨塲助威、並分組兩隊啦啦隊吶喊、替我隊打氣加油、各人的熱情厚意、眞足感戴、鐘鳴五下、兩隊並排着走到塲之中央、同向兩面的觀衆行禮、（大會的規矩）我隊擇門得勝、先得背日之利、大戰爆發、我隊一鼓作氣、卽取攻勢、時用邊陲進襲、時由中路進取、敵方一時手足無措、圾初十五分、幾全屬國隊天下、有一次　順得桂成傳中離門十五碼、苟停而發射、勢必中的、乃彼一時心急、球到卽蹴、致失準繩、斜出門柱一尺、此球不勝、想亦天意、須知在勢均力敵的局面中、量初一球之得失、勝敗常繫於其間、嗣後英雖屢屢反攻、但亦未瀕於危、不久余為敵衛球撞腹部、氣為之塞、施救後始復賽、上塲終結、如無所獲、然在塲中外觀衆均認吾隊表演不俗、且多佔優勢、上塲不能取勝、實為吾人下塲失敗之先兆、良機錯過、到現在尚有餘憾、檸檬後再復登塲、我隊苦戰二十五分、仍未見勝負、延至二十八分、始由其右翼傳中、我隊守者失誤、由其左鋒近門破網而入、打開紀錄、斯時我隊長力漸形不濟、敵乘先勝之威、屢屢脅迫、卒於十分內以雷同之傳遞、被敵中鋒再立一功、勝敗遂因而判定、我隊雖仍作困獸之鬥、先後由余及景祥遠射、亦無功而還、鳴金收軍、我隊遂以二比零之成績、被淘汰出局、不能再復覬覦錦標、惟有靜看他人迄鹿罷了、</p>
<p>是賽我們雖敗、但施展尚可人意、留下極佳印象、博得興論界極好批評、並且運動精神方面、也有良好的表現、但據我本人的意思、我們那天還拿不出我們十足的功夫、南遊中戰印度戰仰光戰星洲諸役、比較上還精彩佳妙、這恐怕是因為停頓過久和上面所說的「過度思慮Over-Anxiety有以致之罷、戰後沈嗣良對我說他不大滿意前鋒的左方、錯過了不止一次的良機、又據我們的容主任和黃管理的觀察、他們都以為如果是日改用紀良守門、兩球或都可以解救、這三位先覺者之言、我也表點同情、因為錦順和北華、都漸覺肥胖遟緩了、家平守門、雖較老練、和敏捷機智、但因身材的關係、撲救險救、却沒有紀良來得勇敢、那天的兩失、都離門甚近、守者如有男氣的話、實應走出來抱撲救護、事後還有狠多關係者說、如果我們改用下列的陣勢、結果或會轉變也未可定、</p>

<p>這種論調、雖則未嘗絕無見解、但事後的忖測、是靠不住的、焉知以上列的陣容去應敵、不更慘敗、不更無濟、我唯一的大憾、是英國第二週中竟因守門之失誤、頻頻被錦標第四平平無奇的波蘭征服了、這樣一來、從比較中越顯出我們的渺小、其實說句老實話、除了體格氣力本跑各方面、是趕人不上外、我們的球藝、又何嘗多讓於他人、</p>

<p>— （周夢墨）</p>
<p>無因怎會得果，果原是因的代價，下一分努力苦幹的因，才能得一分朵的收穫。朋友：我們不要一味對環境的惡劣而苦悶，頹唐，須知苦悶是消沉志氣的墳墓；頹唐是自甘墮落的陷阱。我們只要堅忍勇毅地奮發起來，披荆斬棘埋頭苦幹下去，才有跨上光明燦爛康莊大道的份兒。</p>
<p>一梗細小的火柴，似乎不值得人們去重視；可是它的用度，只消在日常的生活中體騐一下，便會覺察到它對於人類具有偉大的貢獻，深含着「殺身成仁」的意義。我們該把它來對自己多多警惕，做個敎訓：就是要使自己的生命充實而有價值，惟有泡着犧牲的精神來做人。</p>
<p>海裏的波濤，汹湧澎湃，發出震盪的聲浪，駭人聽聞，水力摧殘物體的猛烈，不可一世。這是浪的推動浪的團結的威力的發揮。號稱地大物博的我們中國，如果能够一致團結，自强不息，還會日坐愁城痛遭列强的侵凌和領士喪失的慘遇嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c188">翻筋斗 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>小時候在家鄉的生活是快樂的，遇到做「草檯」戲。那就到了拆天的日子。淸早由夥計把松板長凳放在小車上推去戲塲搭看檯。一開鑼，早己和其他的孩子們在戲檯下帶奔帶竄，像我這匹野馬，媽收不住，爸也收不住，看檯上一刻坐不定，芝蔴糖騙不了我，牛肉餃亦騙不了我。然而，只要等戲檯上做武戲，花臉翻筋斗的時侯，就爬上看檯，張大眼睛，安心地看着了。</p>
<p>愛看翻筋斗，大約是我天性的嗜好，能連翻十多個筋斗的那個瘦猴子花臉，最使我佩服，他愈翻得滿頭大汗，透不過氣，我的小手愈拍得響，跟着別人喊「好好好」，後來戲檯上跑出一個小戲子，年紀那時跟我相仿，然而他的筋斗翻得不好，不活絡，險些兒滾落戲檯，我笑了，笑他不中用，心理想：假使我翻起來，一定比他好。</p>
<p>以後果然學習一次翻筋斗，記得是三姑在曬塲上縫被頭的時候，脫掉鞋子走上軟軟的棉花胎，灣下腰，手撑住，頭頂着棉胎，滿想把脚向上一豁翻過去，可是不成，一次二次全失敗了。終於由小叔叔帮忙，抱住我的腿堅起，又翻過去，可是頭發暈，眼花，手臂瞥痛了。我只才又佩服那個小戲子，覺得他的本領比我大出百倍，不應該笑他—</p>
<p>自從知道翻筋斗是苦事後，直到現在，每次見戲子在檯上翻筋斗，再也不忍拍手喊好了。以人之苦，為己之樂，怎說得過？然而，目今世面，吃了千萬苦楚，彩聲還博不到一點，休親是同情了。人們被磨折在生活中，正好比翻筋斗，最苦的是一個筋斗翻落檯底，博得看客們轟堂的「倒彩」。</p>
<p>偶然和朋友在酒店買醉，忽瞥見有一個九歲模樣的孩子，在桌前大翻筋斗，翻得並不活絡，初還以為店裏的孩子鬧頑皮，後來却愈翻愈用勁。旋又小臉鐵靑地，伸出墨黑的手掌向酒客們討銅子了。這發現還是初决，小小的年紀靠翻筋斗冀博取一些生活源泉。回想從前，心坎中一陣難過。</p>
<h3 id="c189">秋與中年 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>一個人的少年時代，就好比是一年中的第一個季節——春，風光爛漫，朝氣飛揚，眞是太美麗了，太可愛了。到了壯年，便似入於夏季，雖然花飛一片，老去春光，但紅瘦綠肥，枝幹鬱勃，顯着非常的健朗，而那一股熱辣之氣，雄壯之懷，凌厲騰踔的精神，也正像那炎炎夏日的使人生畏。及至進入了中年的階段，那闊大的懷抱，勇猛的氣槪，都逐步的消逝了，這就無異由夏徂秋，在氣候的推進中，不知不覺地漸向蕭索方直走去，連自己也懞然於今日之我，何以大異於昨日之我？至於秋再過去了怎樣呢？那不妨讓他去模糊吧，不必再去想像了。</p>
<p>「做人難做中年人」，「哀樂中年」，天而有知，對這一個秋季，必也抱着同樣的感覺。眞的，無論在何一方面對比起來，中年與秋，秋與中年，實在太相脗合了。一個秋季中的無定的風雨的吹打，無異人到中年，不常要受生活的刺激；秋季中的四野蟲聲，那麼的如怨如慕，如泣如訴，恰又絕類人在中年，總感無法打破妻子的柴米的絮聒，解除兒女的飢寒的啼號；秋季中的滿階階落葉，愈掃愈多，那與中年人的失望頻來，牢愁莫破，更無二致。這樣冷酷的秋容，蕭條約秋意，豈還不足象徵中年人的表情與胸懷嗎？但在秋季中也有比較其他的季節愉快的，那便是分外皎潔的中天皓月，這也正和中年人的心鏡一般，透視了人間世的一切罪惡，悟澈了人間世的一切變幻，對於人生的眞義的照顧，是愈加明亮了。</p>
<p>所以，雖說秋是憂愁的，悲傷的，但也只有中年人才能深深領略，細細辨味，抑且人與秋打成一片，憂愁悲傷，攪成了一堆。少年壯年，根本是沒有秋季的，憂愁何來？悲傷奚自？</p>

<p>— 薑公</p>
<p>——上海特產之一</p>
<p>上海是寸金之地，地價之高，房租之鉅，令人咋舌搖頭，而二房東制度的盛行，更使一般居民，浪費較多的租金，却住不着一間稍堪滿意的房子，愈加呼寃呌苦，但是做三房客的，困於經濟，正不得不飲鴆止渴，張大着眼睛，忍受二房的虐待！</p>
<p>在內地，窮苦的小市民或破落戶，能力不足獨租一幢房屋，也有許多人家合住在一個大門以內的，——在北平，喚做『大雜院』，住在這裏的，祇限於極不堪的窮家小戶，那些自命為中上流的人物，無論窮困　如何地步是打死他也不肯降尊紓貴，同流合汚的，恐怕低减了高貴的人格，玷汚了淸白的身家，——但這都由大房東直接分租，偶然租戶因屋多人少，想節省開支，而將餘屋再轉租別人的，也未嘗沒有，却僅僅乎佔着極少數，至於借此營利，恃為生財之道，養命之源，甚至本人並不居住在內，市特地租下幾听房子，當乍商店的貨物，私人的財產的，那就祇有上海的所謂二房東了。</p>
<p>上海的社會，本來是畸形的組織，內容黑暗得該人聽聞，所以容易產生許多特殊階級，表演無數鬼域伎倆。二房東便是這特殊階級之一，我常說：上海多數居民之所以感受着生活之困苦，經濟之壓迫，其最大原因，却並不在乎生活程度之高，而由於那些寄生在這社會的陰暗面的蠢蟲，在大衆身上作層層的剝削，於是窮者愈窮，苦者愈苦，而他們不耕而食，不織而衣，專靠很巧妙地朘吸窮人的脂膏，一個個倒養得腦滿腸肥，很不錯的樣子。</p>
<p>二房東的唯一職業，就是利用房租的昂貴，和多數市民經濟能力的薄弱，由他們墊出一筆錢來，承租下若干房屋，然後以更昂貴的租價，一間一間的零碎分租出去，儼然是個上下其手的經紀人，從中壟斷居奇，坐收漁人之利，一轉手之間，不但可以白住房子，連生活問題也附帶的解决了。前幾年，法租界的全盛時代，寳裕里寳興里一帶的房屋，因為地點適中，供不應求，租金特別貴得出乎情理之外，每　間統廂房，竟要租到百元左右，而來租的還不免你爭我奪，並且有肯出挖費，做二房東的，那時祇要租下一幢三上三下的房子每月穩有幾百元可賺。這種好生意，除了上海，別的地方尋得着麼？再如外埠倘有什麼天災人禍，像齊盧戰爭和漢口大水之類的意外事變發生，有綫的人，紛紛逃到上海來避難，那又是他們奇貨可居勒索高價的好機會到了，（有許多經濟專家，特地託詞請舊有的三房客搬走，而重新貼出召租條子，自己更全家都睡到樓梯下的地板上等處，將房間騰出來租給逃難的人，想趁這時期大大的發一批洋財。）而擁有這房產的大房東，是無法分享這權利的。近兩年來，上海也被不景氣包圍着，市面衰微，銀根緊急，商業最繁盛的南京路，居然也發現不少的空房于，因逃租欠租而被十字紙條兒封貼在門首的商店，通地都是，减租的呼聲，高唱入雲，二房東到了這時候，也許要暗暗焦慮着所處地位的動搖，當然所得的紅利，也今非昔比了。然而，無論如何，蝕本的生意，他們是不會做的！（不過，最近，貼空房錢的很多，付不出租金的三房客也不少，皮之不存，毛將焉附，所以，今日之下，二房東也正可為而不可為呢！。）</p>
<p>二房東以前大半是榨取三房客的骨髓和血汗的寄生蟲，多數的居民，都因他而加重負担，住着更貴的房子：索討租金，比大房東更利害，大房東處，還可以欠租三月之久，二房東却不許遲延一日，那副冷若冰霜鐵向無私的神情，比閻羅包老還要難看些，因此，他們與三房客之間，常常鬧着彆扭，很此彷彿仇敵，難得有相安無事的，並且，為了電燈光度的大小，和夜點開燈時間之久暫，也成為雙方爭吵的焦點。（當然，也有好些行為高潔的二房東，並不以牟利為目的，餘屋分租時，非高尚的房客，不肯輕易租出，但這究竟比居奇漁利的少得多，尤其不容易求之於貧民窟中！）</p>
<p>最可笑的，還有一種三房東，他本是三房客，向二房東租得一大間或兩間房子，遇着有人肯出較高的租金，他認為有利可圖，便分一半租給別人，一般的也貼起吉屋分租的紙條，總算也給他過一過房東的癮，總算也是貲產階級的了。因有三房東，於是乎又有所謂四房客也者，這種人，比起公館設在草棚裏面的，自然又好一點啊！</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>當着夏日，小　的四週，全是寸來長的綠草，像在地面上蓋了一床綠氈子一樣。雖然沒什麽樹木，但是種菜的人家，籬笆上爬滿了靑藤。在那菜園短墻裏一排一排的葵花桿，一堆一堆的瓜棚，却也很有些趣味。那石觀音菴在幾顆稀立的樹下，露出一帶紅墻，在晨光熹微裏，鏜然的幾下早鐘聲。在這裏放眼一看，總覺心裏空洞了許多。梧軒兄妹二人，踏着草　上的露水珠子，彼此默然的走着，彼此沒有提到什麽要緊的話。夢蘭站在路口上問聽道：大哥，我們到讀書台上去嗎？梧軒笑道：早上很淸凉的，我們又何必上高下低，走出一聲的汗。那老虎石上，有兩塊乾凈石頭，可以到那裏去坐坐。我大概很有幾句話和你談一談。夢蘭噸到，雖然，摸不着他是什麽用意，可也不敢回駁，只有隨了他走。上了幾層土坡，走到一片平遠石塊地上。在那碎石縫裏，千元自向外伸着叢生的短草。看那草頭上露水珠子，還是一顆顆的鮮明掛着，表示着夜氣未全收盡。因之走到這裏，曉風吹到身上，還有點凉習習的。四週不見一個人影，只有鳥在天空飛過。梧軒站定了脚向夢蘭看了一眼，正色道：我到這裏來，並非要你來玩，有一樣東西要交給你。說着，伸手到懷裏摸索了一陣，摸出章國器那封信來。夢蘭看到這封信，立刻臉上飛起了一陣紅暈。加之那信封又是拆開了口子的，　情形是不待細說。因之心裏頭便是像小鹿　着一般，使　的中裏向外撞。梧軒直把這封信遞過來，他也只好接着。可是頭早垂了去了，不能抬起來。（八四）</p>

<h3 id="c214">青年男女的摩登病　為投入墮落與毀滅之途！ <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>在青春期中最使青年們煩悶的，就是性的衝動之發生；而不得性的解決。既沒有正當的性行為以為解決，於是煩惱，失望，苦悶，焦灼相逼而來，以致形成不良之自　（手淫）行為，或變態之同性愛。總之，這都是病態的性行為。在這樣的情況之下，於是「神經衰弱」症和生殖機能障碍，都相續發生，成為現代社會上最多的摩登病了。</p>
<p>這些病不但是妨害青年男女們健康的最大原因，而且是亡國的病根。試看他國的青年對於國家是怎樣？如德意志之國社青年團，均發揮了最大的威力，此外如意大利之棒喝黨，日本之軍人，實在大部分是好勝的青年人。可是我們中國的青年呢？在這性的煩惱苦悶之下，垂頭喪氣地投入墮落與毀滅之途。這樣。中國怎麼可以復興呢？</p>
<p>通常犯着手淫的青年男女，大多數是有神經衰弱的病象；如記憶力減退，痴呆而無生氣，憂鬱悲觀，頭痛，昏眩，失眠，不論作業或讀書，都沒有耐心，易感疲勞與厭倦，而無勇氣，腰　腿軟，背脊疼痛，消化障碍，身體　瘦容顏衰老等病態。除此以外，同時還有生殖器的技能障害—如男性的夢遺，滑精，陰莖短小，腎萎，早洩，女子性的冷淡症，不感症，月經不調，子宮和卵巢的發育不全等，這都是由於自　的結果，幷且影響於未來的兩性生活，而造成家庭間的種種悲劇。失去了人生的幸福，失去了前途的光明，失去了奮鬥的勇氣，苦悶煩惱，沒有再比這個大的了！</p>
<p>這裏我要來指導你們，神經衰弱和生殖器的技能障碍等的治療法，幷不十分困難；今天再將歐美專家的質料經騐，寫些出來，以作患者自己醫治的門徑。對於神經衰弱不論男女，凡有頭重，頭痛，健忘，失眠，思想滯鈍，精神萎頹等現象者，都應服用「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic。培養其神經，自能迅速消失，恢復康健。一方面如有生殖器技能的障害，男性之性器發育不全，陽痿，早洩，遺精，腎虧等。即宜服用強精補腎的睾丸腺製劑「還爾童」Well　Tonic女性之冷感症，性慾減退，以及月經不調，赤白帶下，痛經，虛損等，即當服用調經保健的卵腺製劑「美奴甯」Menorrin這三種藥品，都是確實有效而且安全無害的家庭治療用的內服藥。患者如能對症施用，則上列諸症，不難迅速痊愈。在黑暗生活中煩悶着的青年男女們！願你們走向光明之大道，挽救國家之危亡，振拔自己之沒落，醒來！吧這就是你們除弱圖強的方法呀！</p>
<h3 id="c215">肺病退熱與治愈之捷徑 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Dr．Bale作　方視同譯</p>
<p>肺癆病之體溫。如在三十七度以上者。即為病部尚未生成全防禦堤防之證。不論其病重輕。乃屬進行之徵。治愈肺病之捷徑。以降熱法。而使病勢停止，最為當務之急。斷無病勢未經停止。而可一　全治者也。體溫未復平溫。亦難於求病勢停止。故治療肺病之第一步。為早使達到無熱始為根治之方策。</p>
<p>有熱患者。如濫用化學藥品內服。以求急於退熱。頗為不當。因此等退熱劑。性質猛烈。副作用大。且其解熱效用為一時的—不自然的—患者往往因用此等強烈之退熱藥品。致生其他不快之副症者。極為危險。</p>
<p>肺病發熱之最合理而且根本的療法。依據各國肺病療養院之實騐報告。以內服『肺活』Phith　Weal為適當。因本品之成分。係採自壯健動物新鮮肺臟與脾臟中提出之荷爾蒙（又名內分泌）所製。其效能於體內產生特異免疫質。增加抗毒作用。且抑止結核毒素之分泌。中和體內之毒素。（發生解毒作用）使調節體溫之中樞恢復正常。其天然退熱之效果與安全。確非化藥品所能冀及者也。</p>
<p>『肺活』Phith　Weal中之荷爾蒙（內分泌）。服至體內。其最大之效力為旺盛肺臟。生理機能。增加肺之活量。使衰萎之組織復活。可依再生之機能。增殖結締細胞。包圍病部。於其周圍築成堡壘式之堤防。禁錮癆菌之活動。防止病變向他部擴大。而癆菌終被尅服。自歸消滅。病部遂變為硬化形成疤痕。則自然進入全治之境。故『肺活』為近世最合理有效根治肺病之內服藥。幷非過言也。</p>
<h3 id="c216">月經與健美 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 柏秀貞</p>
<p>月經與婦人病有密切之關係。稍一不注意。即誘發種種疾病。而致全身虛弱。妨害健美。然我國婦女因數千年來閉關自守之積習。憚於就醫診治。失却治療之時機。因而損失生殖機能。不能盡婦女之責。減却一生之幸福不少。甚或至喪亡最貴重之生命。甚屬可歎。生殖器病之普通者。如月經閉止。月經過多或過少。經期不正或前或後。月經困難經來腹痛。子宮發炎。赤白帶下等患。查其病原概由體質虛弱所致者居多。故治療方法。須服調經補血劑。始能重登健康之域。</p>
<p>調經補血劑中。以『美奴甯』Menorrin為最有特效。凡患有月經不調者——得以調正。久婚未孕者——得有生育。體力疲怠者——得以精神充足。以及因經病而來之百病——得以解除——身體瘦弱者——得以肥壯。確為解除婦女痛苦之聖藥。保持健美之源泉。用敢介紹。尚望女界同胞。幸注意焉。</p>
<h3 id="c217">氣喘根治實驗報告 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Dr.Kaller　M.D.述　沈兆荃醫師譯自（德國肺病週刊中）</p>
<p>氣喘之療法。從前因無完美之藥物。故世人皆認為難得根治之症。即吾輩臨床醫家。對於本病。亦感棘手。祗於發作時。藉麻醉劑（嗎啡鴉片）暫時緩解其痛苦而已。欲其痊愈不發。總屬困難無望。惜此等麻醉劑不宜常用。恐有中毒之處耳。市間販賣之氣喘藥。其成分中因含有麻醉劑。雖能立刻生效。但若每發必用。則往往有成癮之弊。病家如購服此類含有毒質之氣喘藥。非但不能根治。且往往能貽中毒之巨害。可不慎之哉。</p>
<p>茲有Dr．Humbert　M．D．亨皮耳脫醫學博士根據多年經驗與最新學理。採用壯健動物之內分泌素配製。發明一氣喘根治藥。其名『哮立平』Holipin係一種內服片劑。藥內不含絲毫毒質。雖功效偉大。但無任何副作用。專治老幼各種氣喘。呼吸困難等症。曾經萬國醫師推獎採用。余近年來治療氣喘一症。不下三百餘例。均投以『哮立平』Holipin而能獲到根本治愈者。竟達有百分之九十五人。茲就診餘之暇。將最近治愈者摘錄二倂於左。備同道及同病者之借鏡。</p>
<p>第一例。某君。四九歲。</p>
<p>（經過）體格平常。罹患咳嗽三年。每屆冬令。則咳嗆尤甚。（俗稱寒咳）自廿三年秋季起。幷發氣喘。</p>
<p>（病狀）平日祗覺呼吸略有不暢。至發作時。遂感十分困難。苦悶異常。不能平臥。口唇及面色青紫。冷汗淋漓。厥狀苦惱非筆墨可形容。且發時多在深夜。須經過數小時。咯出中稠之痰液後。始漸見輕快。恢復平息。每月發作一二次。每逢節令。更較平時劇烈。曾服粘西各藥多種。未獲根治。</p>
<p>（診斷）氣管支哮喘症</p>
<p>（治療及攝生）常至荒野散步。多吸新鮮空氣。但注意勿受感冒。居室改良。使空氣易於流動。日光充足。多進滋養豐富之食品。禁用烟酒等刺戟性物質。</p>
<p>治療藥劑。令服用『哮立平』Holipin於發作時頓服三片。大抵在十分鐘內。喘息平定。咯痰稀鬆。呼吸順暢。平時於間歇期間。仍持續內服。每日三次。每次二片。此外幷用強肺劑之『肺活』Phith　Weal同時內服。每日三次。每次一食匙。共計服用十五星期。久咳與氣喘。均告痊愈。至今已有八月之久。從未發作云。</p>
<p>（經過）身體虛　（腺病質）自幼四歲時。於罹患麻疹之後。即咳嗽連綿未愈。到至九歲。遂成氣喘。</p>
<p>（病狀）咳嗽。咯痰。呼吸困難。咳嗽。夜晚及晨間較多。如氣候突變之時。即發氣喘。先覺腦痛。顔面蒼白。而呈苦悶之狀。呼吸極似困難。非常努力。且延長而帶喘鳴。腹筋緊張如板。咯痰頗不容易。及至將見輕鬆時。始覺痰易咯出。每次劇烈發作之延緩經過。必須一二星期。始漸稍平。漸復常態。曾服藥注射。未能根治。</p>
<p>（診斷）氣管支性哮喘。幷左肺尖結核。</p>
<p>（即氣喘及肺病）</p>
<p>（治療）令嚴行空氣。日光。安靜。及營養諸攝生法。囑服氣喘特效藥『哮立平』Holipin及肺病特效藥『肺活』Phith　Weal兩種同時幷用。約服九星期。氣喘痊愈。肺病已治十分之七。故此後即單服『肺活』又一月餘。檢查之下。亦獲痊治。且身體壯健如常云。</p>
<h3 id="c218">消磨生活力的遺精疾患 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 方視同</p>
<p>喜甫崔兩氏曰。「一滴之精液。勝於四十滴之血液」。又曰不自然之情欲使精液外放。其弊有二。一消耗血液中之榮養分。一浪費神經之活力。於以知精液之濫費。為可怖矣。</p>
<p>抑精液不僅為體力之本。又為智力之源。霍爾博士曰。少年之睾丸分泌物——精液——由血液送於心臟。再由心臟輸至各動脈。其灌注於筋組織者。使筋肉強壯。灌注於頭腦者。使思想明瞭。判斷力健全。意志堅強。故患遺精之學生。其成績多不良。非精液有關智力而何。</p>
<p>遺精之病。多見於少年。為無意識的自然漏出精液之謂也。病者無勃起與快感一週之間。洩精數次。或一夜洩精數次之謂也。翌日全身倦怠。四肢脫力。昏迷憂鬱。甚者畫間亦不時洩精。為極重之滑精（又名漏精）當大小便時尤甚。</p>
<p>遺精·滑精之原因甚多。最普通者為手淫及房事過度不完全性交等而起。又如猥褻之談話·淫書·淫畫·淫劇等。亦能促起本症。若患者不求適當之治療。則危害生命。斷絕子嗣。小而言之。消滅個人終身之幸福。大而言之。為弱國亡種之源。故患者不可不急為治療也。</p>
<p>依吾人之臨床試騐。以『福郎』固精片Fonan　Tab．為最安全的治療藥。因本品係採用固精補腎等劑製成。為一種強壯補益藥品。毫無毒性。對於遺精１滑精漏精等之治療。頗有神效。即服用稍久。亦決無流弊。此為各國臨床醫家所推獎。認為治療本症最安全最有效之藥品。</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃</p>
<p>患肺病者之經濟倘不生問題。宜早日至專門醫師處。施行科學之療法。因屬極佳。惟對於醫師之選擇。最易使人逃於歧路。患者欲托以生命之醫師對於其醫德。是否高尚。收費為是否貧民化抑為貴族化。此等皆為病家擇醫之常識。亦為經濟的療肺之先決問題也。</p>
<p>若患者因僻居鄉地。缺乏專門醫師。或限於經濟。無力延醫診治者。則在自宅療養。亦可達到痊愈之目的。病家須知此病需要長期之療養。應有支持長期之計劃。方為最賢明之方法。</p>
<p>在自宅療養者。祗須奉行空氣·營養·安靜等天然療法。同以加以合理有效之療肺劑內服。依據歐美專家實騐之報告。最新臟器製劑『肺活』Phith　Weal之內服療法。頗有效果。凡一二期肺病咯血·咳嗽·氣急·潮熱·盜汗等病象。服用本品後。遂日漸減退。如與衛生攝養法。同時幷行。大抵於三四月之時。即告痊愈。此種療法。無須多大費用。即貧民亦易實行。故多能至於全治。實為經濟的療養法中最有效之方策。</p>

<h3 id="c220">輸血問題 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>最近上海某醫院組織輸血團，辦理買血事項，因此引起社會的注意，某律師曾有呈請司法行政部解釋本問題是否犯罪的建議，茲將其所持的理由歸納如下：</p>
<p>（一）血液為生命之要素，被抽者有血盡身死之虞，而在病者本身，毫無實益。</p>
<p>（二）抽血雖出被傷者之自願，然自願受傷，無異自殺，敎唆或帮助他人自殺之行為有罪，則敎唆並帮助他人之自傷亦應有罪。</p>
<p>（三）抽取窮賤之血，以利富貴之人，使富者壯而窮者弱，富者生而貧者死，實為法所難容。</p>
<p>我們對於某律師的建議，認為第一第二兩點，有討論之餘地。輸血為科學療法之一，在醫學上，有着重大的地位，論其功效，確能起死回生，某律師所說「毫無實益」一語，實為絕無根據之詞，至於被抽者的本身，因為所抽並不過多，所受的損失也很有限，稍事修養，卽可復原，决不至於如某律師所說的「血盡身死」，輸血療法，是一種以有餘補不足的療法，他的本身，確有其價值的。</p>
<p>某律師所提出的第二點，就是傷害問題，他認為被抽者雖屬自願受傷，但施術者却有敎唆或帮助他人自願受傷之罪，鄙意此項理由，實屬碍難成立，姑無論「敎唆與帮助他人自願受傷」一語，不見於法律之明文，卽使認為完全與立法的原則吻合，而法律上因明明有「正當行為不罰」一語，以為操自由職業者行使其職業內應行之權利作一解釋·醫師為職業的原故，凡在醫學範圍以內，隨時有使用麻醉品及截斷肢體等手術之權，因為這是正當行為，故不能謂之傷害，輸血旣為科學療法，當然是正當行為，而况被抽者出於自願，並非由醫師的敎唆，同時被抽之後稍為修養卽可復原，也並無多大的危險，更談不到傷害呢！</p>
<p>某律師所提出的第三點，那多少有他的相當的理由，抽取貧者之血，以利富者之身，無論如何是不合人道的，假使醫師再從中漁利，以極低價收取血液，以最高價轉輸與他人，一出一入之間，卽於賺取一筆重大的利益，這種行為比較販賣人口的人販，吸取民脂的貪官，有過之無不及的，</p>
<p>某律師的建議，旣各上述，茲再將鄙人對於本問題之建議，略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）人的問題　輸血雖不是犯罪的行為，但若以金錢的買賣，抽取貧人之血以注射於富人之身，又確為最不合於人道之事，須知本問題根本的條伴是被在抽者不是因金錢的引誘，而是完全出於惻隱之心的驅使，人類之中，最富於惻隱心的要算宗敎家了！中國的僧尼，外國的男女敎士，他們皆是以慈悲為懷的，又皆是願意捨身救世的，我們且看他們的敎主，以身餵虎的佛，釘死在十字架上的耶穌，那種偉大的犧牲精神，眞足為一般宗教家取法，所以我希望世界上的宗敎家，本着惻隱之心，自動的聯合起來，組織一個輸血團體，從事於貧血病者血液之供給，古人說：「刲臂療親」，那是出於孝心的驅使，輸血救人，都是出於慈悲心的驅使，何况宗敎多半抱獨身主義，無情慾之紛擾，血液更要淸潔一點呢，世界的宗敎家們！其誦經拜佛祈禱於上帝之前，何如各輸滴血，來做這種確與人類有益的善事呢？</p>
<p>（二）輸血之用輸血在戰爭時更為重要，戰爭開始了，那些為國家為民族而奮鬥，戰士，大量的流着自己的血來爭取國家和民族的光榮，伊們受傷了！流血了！醫生用手術鉗制住伊們的血管使牠們停止流血，但是終有因流得過多而消失了生命的，這時在後方的人們，對於這班受傷的健兒，應如何盡量也供給他們呢，物質的供給當然是要緊的，但是用自己的血來供給他們，自動的送給醫生抽取，使得這班流血的戰士得到血的補救，很容易的恢復健康，重上疆塲殺敵，這種辦法，不是比物質的供給更有價值嗎？臨陣殺敵的戰士是直妾的流血，輸血的後方人士是間接的流血，同是民族英雄，同一有功於國。</p>
<p>總之，輸血一事，本身無所謂善惡，而動機和對象有善惡，不可以金錢為動機，以階級為對象，而要以慈悲和忠義為動機，以人類和國家為對象。</p>

<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>（乙）救濟院施診所</p>
<p>每年夏季由本地著名慈善家沈昕泉發起聯絡中醫公會主持其事，施診兼給藥（中藥）醫者均係中醫，雖範圍不大，亦無從統計，故其成緒如何，不能報吿於讀者前。</p>
<p>（丙）醫院中附設施診所</p>
<p>每於時令病行將發現前，各醫院中或種痘，或預防注射頓形忙碌，貧病完全免費，際此農村衰落聲中，造福人羣匪淺。</p>
<p>（十三）醫藥狀况</p>
<p>（甲）醫院</p>
<p>比較著名者為生生醫院，院長夏蒼霖，學識經騐均甚富豐，院內分內，外，花柳，皮膚，小兒等科，並附設藥房，醫師三，助理醫師五，診例門診一元，出診二元二，飛邀四元四，貧病免費。病牀雖僅近十張，然於硤鎭已屬鳳毛鱗角。</p>
<p>覆恩醫院設於南寺街，院長陳濟民，英美派為一敎會醫院，完全慈善性質，故診務甚為發達，嘉惠平民匪淺。</p>
<p>利生婦產科醫院，——硤石產科向在黑暗時代，本無產科之專設，人民生產有識者咸往嘉興或滬杭等地著名大規模醫院中，無識者均延收生婆接生，故危險性甚多，「產婦一脚在棺材中」，成為硤石的俗語，其收生婆之不利於產婦程度可知。自吳斐如女史創立利生後，風氣為之一開，無識者已漸漸能享受科學的實惠了，這可值得欣慰的。</p>
<p>宏康醫院，院長錢舜鶴，資格老練，醫師載百平外科大手術技能匪淺，內部設備尚稱完備，其餘醫院大小不下六七所，院長出身或看護或見習生，均非正式而設備方面每未臻完善，按內政部衛生署所規醫院資格，完全不符，故這裏無記述之價值，以免精榻寳貴的篇幅。</p>
<p>（乙）醫室</p>
<p>醫室專指中醫而言，這裏著名的儒醫為蔣蔭椿，張午橋，名醫計內科：王和伯，俞子英，外科鍾惟心，岳文淸，小兒科：胡咸生，喉科平劍塵，針炙：周子欽，瘋科：吳新霞，傷科：楊世復，牙科：周延林等均各設醫室於其寓所，門診每日有自近十號起至數十號不等，出診以轎代步，自農村衰落以來，據說均受影響，診務不過三四成而已。</p>
<p>（丙）藥房</p>
<p>全鎭藥房僅三：一華美，業務不甚發達，範轉亦小，亞洲規模較大，老闆李國熹，精明幹練，曾於上海靑年會會擔任過英文敎授，自設立已來，年有盈餘資本已由數百元而發達到逾萬，北大街之中法藥房亦為其所頂。營業範圍，病家前往配藥者可稱絕無，因均由醫院中所配，故專靠附近各小鎭醫師採用，曁民衆購備。當地醫院中僅臨時包弗脚之用。</p>
<p>（丁）中藥號</p>
<p>此地藥材行僅三計：廣生，久大永，萬源等；吳采芝今年剛擴充，範圍不及廣生等那般大，藥號著名者為長生堂，有口皆碑，其次為同仁堂，天源堂，天生堂等數十家，近受了醫生診務淸淡，農村經濟恐慌打擊，均日趨衰落中。</p>
<p>（戊）江湖術士</p>
<p>本鎮時有江湖遊方醫生發現，專以騙錢為目的，甚至冒牌科學醫，實科學醫的進展受到不少阻力！</p>
<p>（十四）衛生行政機關</p>
<p>硤鎭無專設之衛生行政機關，僅一衛生科附設於公安局內，衛生警由聰敏警士兼任，淸道夫僅數名，故對硤石之衛生行政未能十分發展！</p>
<p>（乙）有關醫育</p>
<p>（一）學校及衛生狀况</p>
<p>縣立硤小設於審山麓，為本鎭最高學府，為沈國楹氏滲淡經營，費盡心血的結晶，學生由數十人而發達到三百餘，師資均係師範生，敎育甚為得法，硤石人士莫不讚揚其有功桑梓，沈氏終於勞瘁過度，惜精神大為衰弱，無力繼辦，故曾數度辭職始准，各方聞電紛紛挽留，均歸無效，作者推測大槪敎薪之欠發實為其最大刺激，他曾有將自己祖居出賣，以所得盡充校中經費，自己情願受飢，若沈氏者洵不可多得之熱心一敎育家矣！</p>
<p>凡到過硤小參觀者，皆知硤小無一正式可作敎室之房屋，因校舍盡為廟宇改建，光綫因於山麓故甚佳，空氣自然新鮮，尙符衛生需要，住校生約二三十人，全校用水，由井供給，飲水取自河水，用明凡沉澱法以潔凈之　據該校職員談，每逢春季强迫學生遍種牛痘，秋季始業舉行健康檢查，疫癘流行時施行全校預防注射。</p>
<p>米小為硤石米業公所所創辦之私立高小，經費比較充足，校舍新建西式洋房，故對採光換氣諸點，極符衛生，唯運動塲甚小，因附近實無相當空地故也。</p>
<p>紫薇小學，位於倉基，為一女子高小，校務也甚發達，校長吳慕蘭亦係杭州第一師範高材生，衛生設備方面尚無不合。其餘計亞東，振坤，等不下數校，校舍甚為狹小，唯衛生設備方面也可稱完備，雖經費萬分困難，不因此而不注重衛生，這是知識階級的可貴！</p>

<p>— 陳端白</p>
<p>（三）細菌學方面</p>
<p>李克加的生物學上系統，雖還不大明瞭，但是屬於細菌一類或細菌類似的事實。「（Schizomyceten分裂菌）即普通稱為細菌」可就他生殖的方法，（絞窄橫裂）而斷定，但是生存於細胞以內，（Cytotrop）（所謂細胞傾向）在病者及動物血液內，難於覓得，反之在媒介物消化管及動物組織如睾丸及但思美膜細胞內，（Descemet　Membran　&amp;　Hodenzellen）在相當時期易證明，這是李克加特異之一點，他是用普通或特殊培養基都不能培養成功的，只有組織培養一法，可以行之，Gewebeskultur　TissueCulturc這是李克加特異之第二點，他的體積普通為〇，三至〇，五U，o，３－oU粁（千分之一mm）在既知各種細菌中，沒有比他再小的，這是李克加特異之第三點，李克加是非濾過性的，他不能通過培克氏濾過器，Berkeleld　&amp;Cbamberland他的本　呈球形，略帶橢圓形，恒列為變球菌狀，中間有橫帶，以為連繫，各種色素之感受，以其姆氏色液Giemsa-Farblbung為最合宜，受色後呈深紫色，球形或杆狀，中間橫帶則呈波藍色，各個李克加之輪廓，均難得明顯，李克加之變質時期者，其色素感受之能力亦減退，每每糢糊而輕淡，與細胞顆粒頗難鑑別，李克加當增殖之際，或為細絲狀，或為葡萄球狀，在人體內之增殖能力，還不如在節足蟲及其它動物如家兔等體內之繁　，細胞體外增殖之事實，則至今未能證實云，動物接種，以家兔睾丸及前眼房為最便利，若為臨床上之研究，則猿Macacus　Fascafus日本猿最稱適宜。</p>
<p>（四）李克加病種類及地域分佈</p>
<p>就現在所知各種李克加病計有</p>
<p>（一）發疹傷寒Flecktypbus</p>
<p>（二）塹壕熱Febris　Wolhynica</p>
<p>（三）落磯山紅斑熱Rocky　mountain　spotted　fever</p>
<p>（四）恙蟲病Tautsugamusi　Fieber</p>
<p>其它如Tabardillo　Brill　Disease　Mauchu　TyplivsGndiwisch　Flloklieber</p>
<p>墨西哥發疹傷寒，及滿洲傷寒，以及地方病性發疹熱，均為發疹傷寒一族中的朋友。</p>
<p>就其領域言之，歐洲東南東部諸小國如羅馬尼亞，捷克，波蘭，波俄交界，北美洲，亞洲東部南中國，及日本，臺灣，南洋羣島都有李克加的踪　與發揚它的歷史當然不只二十年，只差以前不知其詳，與其它疑似的病症，混為一談罷了。</p>
<p>（五）病理學方面</p>
<p>李克加侵入人體時，第一步是皮膚，他所引起的變動，是血管壁週沿的侵潤，尤以毛細管為主要場所Perirasuclare　Infiltration淋巴管也同其幸运，依着情勢的進展，這種變化可以深達皮下組織。日本羌蟲病研究者病理學家川村麟也氏曾研究羌蟲病李克加之皮層內病理，及生物學上變動，據云李克加生長於單核細胞中Histiocyt自感染後第三日至第八·九日，為增殖時期，達最高度後，逐漸變性與減少，至第九日後，在二三日內其形態已不完整，數量亦大減，以至於完全消失，筆者在研究皮膚過敏反應時，（羌蟲病）為着前期工作的必經階段，故也曾做過一度的試騐，其結果跟川村氏的報告全相吻合，因李克加的生殖，而引起的病理組織變化，為（一）血管週圍炎，（二）浸潤，（三）變質，（四）壞死，血管　着極度的擴張，共引起的現象當然是血行的紓緩，與血液的因血管壁衰敗而滲出，皮膚內的變化，自始至終，不過二星期，其恢復的情形，是浸潤的減少，血管的收縮，逐漸回復到未病前舊態，而無瘢痕的遺留，在其他器官內有李克加所引起的病理變化，也不外血管週圍炎，跟由此發生的連帶，或續發現象。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（九十三）急性胃黏膜炎（Gastritis　Acuta）</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做急性胃黏膜炎？</p>
<p>（答）這是胃病中最多見的一種疾病，就是胃黏膜急性發炎的病，醫師們通稱為急性胃卡他爾。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的主要原因是什麽？</p>
<p>（答）急性胃黏膜炎的主要原因，是食物過飽，濫食過冷過熱的或腐敗的食物，食時咀嚼不充分等。</p>
<p>（問）除了這些原因之外，還有什麽事情，可以使胃黏膜發急性炎症的？</p>
<p>（答）凡誤吞腐蝕性物質像酸，鹼，石炭酸，昇汞，燐砒等東西，也能發生急性胃黏膜炎。又在急性熱性病，貧血，衰弱的人，往往合併這種病患。</p>
<p>（問）患急性胃黏膜的病人，消化器方面起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）以消化不良症狀為主，就是食慾缺乏，胃部壓迫感，嫌惡攝取食物，口渴，惡心，嘔吐，嘈雜，噯氣等。</p>
<p>（問）病人的口內現什麽症狀？</p>
<p>（答）舌被厚苔，味覺黏糊，口臭，口唇疱疹。</p>
<p>（問）大小便異狀？</p>
<p>（答）大便多秘結的傾向，小便量也比尋常為少。</p>
<p>（問）病人身體，要發熱嗎？</p>
<p>（答）大概發中等度的熱候，在攝氏表三十八度左右。</p>
<p>（問）胃機能和分泌是否受影響？</p>
<p>（答）患了急性胃黏膜炎之後，胃機能當然減退，分泌也減少，遊離鹽酸量，也減少。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣診斷急性胃黏膜炎？</p>
<p>（答）病人若有發熱，容易和傷寒症相混淆，應該從有無脾腫薔薇診來鑑別。</p>
<p>（問）急性胃黏膜炎的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）第一要把胃內積　的內容排除，就是使病人嘔出或行胃洗滌；若不能，那末注射「阿坡嗎啡」使他自起嘔吐。若時間已遲，料想已達腸中的時候，便應投與瀉劑。</p>
<p>（問）病人的食品，應該吃些什麽？</p>
<p>（答）先在一二日內絕食，僅使喝些麥芽湯葛粉湯之類。以後克稍些吃粥魚，雞蛋，肉汁，馬鈴薯，漸漸移到普通食品。</p>
<p>（問）對於胃病和嘔吐，應當怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這時候，可加溫　於上腹部，或內服麻醉劑。口渴的時候，喝些汽水或冷飲品。</p>
<p>（問）到了病勢恢復，應該怎樣用藥？</p>
<p>（答）到了恢復期，可用健胃藥投與，使引起食慾。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（一〇三）耳性的腦膜炎</p>
<p>腦膜炎的種類很多，在一般人口中所說的腦膜炎，乃是流行性腦脊髓膜炎，當有人誤會腦膜炎，只有這一種，那是錯誤的，依着腦膜炎的型類分起來：除了流行性腦脊髓膜炎以外，還有結核性的腦膜炎，漿液性的腦膜炎等許多的分別，那是內科範圍所要討論的問題，這裏姑且不說，現在所要講的，是耳性的腦膜炎。</p>
<p>耳性的腦膜炎的發生，大概逃不了三個途徑，第一：由于中耳炎或乳嘴突起炎而起。第二：由于中耳炎合併化膿性迷路炎而起。第三：由于內耳炎及其他合併症而起。起因肇端于耳，所以呌做耳性腦膜炎。一般耳性的腦膜炎發生：大概是小兒為多，若是因為慢性中耳炎而起的，尤以十歲左右的孩子，最易感染。至于大人則很少見其例，但幼兒的乳嘴突起的骨質，非常的菲薄，所以常幼兒發生乳嘴突起炎時，則要慎防其發生耳性的腦膜炎。</p>
<p>耳性腦膜炎傳染的徑路，大致已如上述，它的病原，亦當深切的認識，據一般學者的意見，雖然葡萄狀球菌，雙球菌等，都可以釀成本病，要以溶血性化膿連鎖狀球菌為最多見。</p>
<p>耳性的腦膜炎，它在臨床上所呈現的症狀和經過，嘗多不同，與一般腦膜炎，間亦有不同之處，就大體言之，它是先有耳病，而後才有頭蓋內腦膜的疾病的，說得明白點，耳病是他的原發病，腦膜病是它的繼發病，它不像流行性腦脊髓膜炎有什麽惡寒發熱嘔吐倦怠頭痛薦骨痛等，前驅症候，不過若是因為急性中耳炎而起，却亦會於流行性腦脊髓腦膜一樣，甚而不眠，不安，聽力起高度的障碍，惡心不已。唯一般耳炎的中耳炎共同的症候，便是體溫愈高，意識　濁亦愈甚，項背強直，腱反射亢進，漸次Kernig的症狀亦出現，足　搦，瞳孔亦起變化，一如一般流行性腦脊髓膜炎，嘗有因為連鎖狀球菌而起的，它的前驅症候並不劇烈，可以不見惡心嘔吐等消化系症狀，僅有全身違和好似感冒一樣，體溫稍稍昇高，頭痛亦祗是輕度，甚或沒有頭痛，臨床的症候，似乎不像腦膜炎，可是而一變起來，會突呈許多劇烈的症狀慢慢又移行于麻痹狀態，這時，雖百般的處置，亦很少有功效，祗有取死的轉歸了。</p>
<p>一般的耳性腦膜炎它的經過，大概是數日乃至一週間，倘是溶血性連鎖狀球菌的關係，三日以內，難逃死亡的轉歸，甚而，在二十四小時以內致死，若不及早發覺了便醫治，那是極為危險的。</p>
<p>總之耳性的腦膜炎，一樣的和流行腦脊髓膜炎，是一個很險惡的傳染病，雖然在臨床上幷不多見，然而亦萬不能輕視了耳病是小病，而不加醫治，等到不幸而傳及腦膜炎，那真噬濟莫及哩！</p>

<h3 id="c226">對日交涉未許樂觀 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>形勢緊張滿城風雨之局面，自日川越大使與蔣院長一度談判後，似乎烟消雲滅，形勢突然緩和，大有化干戈而為玉帛之概，大衆心理，大抵如此，但是我拿中日問題，細細考量，對日交涉，尚未許樂觀。</p>
<p>日本對華交涉，其口頭禪，不是曰親善，便是曰誠意，夫親善與誠意，固所樂聞，但親善與誠意，多是抽象的名詞，而中日的交涉，完全是利害衝突的事實，本來談不到親善與誠意，若談判一事件，竟至於無法解决，而至於决裂，訴之於武力，天然非但我們愛好和平的國家，固有所不願出此，卽喜稱干戈的强鄰，恐亦不願出此，因為一訴諸武力，無論勝負之數誰屬，雙方必有相當之犧牲也，故親善與誠意之說，原是外交上虛僞的名詞，無所謂親善？無所謂誠意？</p>
<p>卽以親善誠意言，親善有親善的限度，誠意有誠意本質，假定甲方要求於乙方，若乙方如其所欲與所願者以償，則甲方天然滿意，是根本親善，是誠意合作，但試問乙方能滿意乎？能親善乎？能誠意乎？假定乙方不能如其所欲與所願者，則必謂對方無誠意，無親善的意思，故誠意與親善，完全附麗於雙方的權利問題，並不是空言所能解决。</p>
<p>卽以今日外交局勢言之，雙方緊張之態度，雖以桑島來華，及川越謁蔣以後，形勢轉趨和緩，但日方現仍堅持華北特殊地位，和反共共同防錢，與我方所持互惠平等，與不損領土主權原則，相去不啻霄壤之別，假定日方抱定此種政策，不肯退讓，則和平希望，實屬甚微，故和平與緊張，全係日方當局，是吾能澈底覺悟？與不能澈底覺悟？此其機原在日方，而不在我國也。</p>
<p>又昨據華聯東京電傳，謂據某方消息，日本對華北，志在必得，擬採取就實避虛方法，所謂就實避虛云者，不佔據華北之名，而佔據華北之實，卽所謂改變侵華方針，而實施經濟侵略是也，日本對於我國之交涉，方式不可謂不多，但一言蔽之，卽百變而不離其宗，此實係日方當局政策之大誤也，夫日方固高唱共存共榮論者，夫中日兩國，非特地勢相接，而利害又是相同，非特同文同種，亦是唇亡齒寒之國也，今日方對於此點，口雖高唱，而其實完全不能瞭解，希圖一己之利害，而忘遠大之企圖，則眞所謂籌策之人無任矣。</p>
<p>故日方面欲眞正與我圖親善，誠意合作，惟有先捐棄其侵略之野心，揭去猙獰之面目，開誠布公，互策利害，則非但我中日兩國之福，實東亞前途之福，也若日方計不出此，其後果眞非我人所及料者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c227">野渡 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 斯</p>
<p>—野渡無人舟自橫</p>
<p>這樣的詩一般的景色，出現在我底眼前的時候，我是帶着一身襤褸的衣衫，和一顆流浪者底心，而默默地欣賞着的。</p>
<p>那是初秋底季節，在南方，吹起了微凉的風，特有的一種無名的花香，沁入了我底鼻孔，使我漸漸地沉醉於大自然底懷抱里，置身一幅最幽美的風景畫中那麼地，做起屬於年靑人的，緋色的夢來了。</p>
<p>但是，我是流浪着啊！……而且我被飢餓所威脅着。……寒冷的日又快來了。……我底去處呢？</p>
<p>我盤起雙脚，坐在草地上。橫在前面的是一條靜靜的溪流，水淸得像一面鏡子，祗是風一掠過，水面就泛起薄薄的波紋。溪面並不闊，然而我環顧四周，都不見有橋，要通過岸，那祗有渡船了。於是我望着，對岸是靑里帶黃的，呈着半成熟了的田野，和疎落的人屋，遠遠地望去，人屋小得更加像水彩畫里庇作物了。樹木是分不淸的，更遠些，那里蜿蜓着蛇一樣的山脈，頑强地蹲伏在地而。天是關大的，藍色一片的大空，秋季里所特有的白雲在飛來鑽去。太陽照得十分鮮明，到處是明朗，靜穆：這眞是多麼引人留連的畫境哪。</p>
<p>望着遼遠的天野，靜靜地，……風在耳邊低語着……太陽愉快地笑起來！……我有着一種說不出的情緒，寗靜了好一些時候。</p>
<p>終於，我是發現了靠左邊的溪流上正躺着無人的野渡，有一支撑杆豎在那里。它浮在水底上面，一側是靠着草叢。我發現了這野渡便從草地上爬起來，跑過去了。</p>
<p>我應該到對岸去，那里不是有着人家，而且已經冒起烟來了麼？</p>
<p>可是我却立定在這野渡旁邊，躇躊起來。……這水彩畫一樣的境界；這秋天里的溪流旁邊，我能不靜靜地享受一下大自然給予的幸福麼？……我木然地站着，我度心在跳動！……把這野渡來載了自己渡過對岸去是殺風景的！……然而我是那樣的飢餓！……我跌在非常的不安里邊去了。</p>
<p>……輕輕的踏在草叢中的脚步聲迫近了我底身後，使我在沉思中驚醒過來。……出現在我身邊的是一個傴僂的老人，手裏持着旱烟管，但是並不吸，朝我底身上打量了一下，就開始說起話來：</p>
<p>「你楞在這溪邊，睜大了眼睛望着這溪流是什麼意思呢？你是初次到這裏來的吧，可是你現在又打算往那裏去呀？」</p>
<p>「我是在想着這野波，是不是可以載我到對岸去呢。」我這麼地回答着，向着他滿是縐紋的臉。「要是走路，那裏才有橋呢？你能告訴我嗎？」</p>
<p>「要過橋是有的，你得往東再走五里路。可是現在已經是吃午飯的時候了。」</p>
<p>他翻過臉去，我也跟着翻過臉去，在不遠的後方，隔着短短的田野，那里</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>有一間農舍底烟囱也正在冒烟。同時，我看見一個藍布衣的少女正朝我們走來，笑開了兩排潔白的牙齒，用一隻手放在額角那里遮着太陽底光綫。這老人知道他底女兒來呌他去吃午飯了，就要我也一道跟他回去；我是推辭着……直到那嬌憨的農家女也一定要留我在這里等到下午再走時，我服從了。……</p>
<p>那是一頓多麼豐富的午餐呵——我這樣地在心里感歎着。……從這農舍出來，伴着我的是老人底女兒，她說要送我到橋底那邊去。……我拒絕了，我誠懇地，感謝着她……我們不覺又走到野渡頭來了，照樣是凉爽的秋風，明朗的天野和縐紋的水流。</p>
<p>「我們就在這里分手吧，」我說了，聲音抖悸着。</p>
<p>她起先是垂着頭；聽了我底話以後，就抬了起來，面對着遼遠的天野，這樣地對我說道：</p>
<p>「在這淙淙流着的溪水之旁，我送去了不知道多少遠行人了　他們都去了就沒有回來。……你到那裏去的呢？難道就像這流水那樣流着，流着，一直流向前頭去麼？」</p>
<p>「我是一個流浪人……」我說。</p>
<p>默默地分手了！……我去東邊走橋到對岸去，把野渡和那農家女撇在後邊，頭也不回地，孤自往前移動着步趾。……</p>
<h3 id="c228">馬鍋頭羣 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>是十月來了呢！</p>
<p>二丈來高的山茶，吐着一朶朶的鮮紅的花，光景是怪密的，老遠望上去，像匹紅布掉在半空也似的。太陽費力地透過那層層的密密的花叢，像經過了一重密密的厚紅紗似的，光芒怪弱的，並且還帶着一些幽紅。</p>
<p>山雀老是不肯停的徘徊在山茶樹間，不用還用牠只硬嘴來啄着樹桿。</p>
<p>一陣山風吹過，把那鮮紅的花瓣，吹在半天裏，飛舞了老半晌，才慢慢的飄下來，密密的，像在下着一陣紅雨。地面像新鋪上了一條紅毯子，軟綿綿的，並且還有些香噴噴的。</p>
<p>在這山裏非常的幽靜，幾乎連螞蟻的脚聲都聽得見。除掉那些馬鍋頭羣趕路經過之外，（註一）尚難得有個把人經過這裏。所以這山就整天的在冷淸淸之間。</p>
<p>黑越越的一羣，的摸有五百來匹的光景。開首的那匹騾子的銅鈴，隨着那山風，「叮東」，「叮東」的響動着，馬蹄發出沉濁的節拍來，背脊上駝着那隻木製的貨架，貨架上滿紮了貨物。接着第二匹，第三匹……漫長的一列，有上二三里的光景。</p>
<p>隔着幾十匹就有一個穿着羊皮褂兒，上面綴着用銀角子做成的紐扣，穿着一雙有紅帶子的草鞋，褲子是提得老高的，棗紅的臉，有着一雙結實的臂膊和腿子的少夥子，他手裏握着牛皮鞭，輕輕地抽着那幾匹落後的畜牲。</p>
<p>「老李，怎麼還不『開稍』呢」？（註一）那個滿臉是汗的說。接着吐了口唾沬，把右衣袖抹了一抹汗。</p>
<p>「誰個知道？趕這樣的路怪沒勁的」。被稱為老李的說。</p>
<p>「你這個色鬼，這裏沒有娘兒們，自然要你沒勁了囉。</p>
<p>哈…哈…兩個子都笑了。</p>
<p>弟兄呀，</p>
<p>努力呀</p>
<p>好好地趕路呀，</p>
<p>趕到市口找個馬店來宿一宵呀！</p>
<p>馬店裏有個小娘兒呀，</p>
<p>頭目騎着一匹馬，從後面趕上來，嘴裏唱着歌，經過弟兄們的身畔，於是弟兄們本能地跟着唱起來！</p>
<p>生得一副好臉兒呀，</p>
<p>烏溜溜的頭髮亮光光呀，</p>
<p>尖尖的手兒把茶來送呀，</p>
<p>他們高聲地唱着，那歌聲悠揚在有回聲的山谷中，怪悅耳的。弟兄們的脚有勁起來了，那個垂死的隊伍，也重復地充滿了蓬勃的生氣。</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸地張起來了，大地披上了層黑紗似的，夜山風呼呼地吹着，怪怕人的。是上弦的前二天，月兒祗一絲，光茫是幽幽地，星星也祗疏落的三兩顆，雲却跑得飛快的，要不是這僅有的幽弱的月光閃照着，這山將完全困於黑暗之間了。</p>
<p>「開稍啦」！頭目揚起左臂呌。</p>
<p>「後面的弟兄趕快趕上來啦」—</p>
<p>「趕快啦，吃晚飯了呢」！</p>
<p>……亂烘烘的，歡忻的口吻。</p>
<p>果然後面的弟兄像潮水一般地擁上來了，頭目吩咐取掉了貨架，派了好些弟兄去放靑，剩下來的有的去找大石頭，有的去找柴，祗剩着十來個守着貨架。</p>
<p>他們很熟練地，揀了三塊差不多大小的石頭，放成一個三角形，鍋子放在上面，下面點起柴來，就把飯煮熟了。</p>
<p>「弟兄們，今天辛苦了，大家吃呀！飽飽地吃一頓呀」！頭目，很和氣地。</p>
<p>「大家吃飽呀」！一陣從心田裏發出來的歡呼。</p>
<p>飯後，找柴的去找柴了，馬也全拴好了，剩下來沒事做的弟兄們，抽着烟談天。　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c233">一九三六年流綫型喜劇　「小玲子」不日公映 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>將繼「狂歡之夜」上映於金城的明星新作「小玲子，」是一部非常値得推薦的好影片，這部片子已攝製竣事了很久，一直由於戲院方面各公司新片之擁擠，以致到最近才得公映。</p>
<p>「小玲子」是把一個鄉村小女子為虛榮利愁所誘，跑入都市去為中心題材的故事，作者在這兒極力地暴露了都會的罪惡，這個造成一切罪惡的現社會，它把一個純潔天眞的小女子呑滅了。這是一個非常有社會價値的作品，很値得我們的注意。</p>
<h3 id="c234">「淸明時節」中之趙丹舒繡紋 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>這個戲是被譽為一九三年流綫型的喜劇，全劇明快和諧的調子，看過試片者，都交口贊譽頗有美國影之作風。</p>
<p>導演是程步高氏，他對於這戲的處理，是曾煞費苦心的，主演者是談瑛·趙丹·梅熹·龔稼農等。</p>
<p>談瑛在這兒，肴着非常的成績，戲也是最吃重的一個，她在這裏努力非凡，無疑能獲得一個新評價。趙丹·梅熹·一個扮演都會的少爺，一個扮演鄉村中的農民，都有極好的戲。</p>
<h3 id="c235">業餘劇人與四十年代　同演「賽金花」 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>避免對台戲業餘已禮讓　希望他門能够携手起來</p>
<p>幾個月之前我們就聽見業餘劇人預備公演「賽金花」的消息，但因為要找一個適當的女主角，以致拖延到現在，才由人介紹一位美專的畢業生，呌徐悟音的來担任賽金花這個角色。但在業餘劇人請歐陽予倩　手排演這個戲的時候，「四十年代」方面也發表要演這個戲，並且和金城已簽訂了合同，卽在本月底公演。</p>
<p>同時「四十年代」也想請歐陽予倩導演，歐陽予倩為了這件事曾向兩方接洽，希望他們能够合作，因為打對台戲，兩方面的時間，精神，金錢，都要受損失的，而况他們正應該携手的時候。</p>
<p>但是沒有結果。於是業餘劇人就開了個全體商討這件事的處置辦法。議决下來，「賽金花」是决定要演的，因為一時沒有適合的劇本可演，且免唱對台戲起見，業餘劇人以友誼的地位寫一封信給「四十年代」，呌他們在月底演出，而業餘則延至下月底或十二月初，在卡爾登公演一星期。不過為了演員精力起見，分先後二次，中間由「中旅」接替。</p>
<p>這辦法是很好的，但是希望這兩個劇團在演了「賽金花」後馬上携手起來，並祝他們努力！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Foreign Minister Zhang to Meet Kawagoe Four Times: Negotiations May Require an Extremely Long Time; Arita Meets Hirota to Report on the Situation; The Three Ministers of Japan to Hold a Meeting Today <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is predicted here that Sino-Japanese negotiations will continue in the next two or three days. At that time, Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe will hold their fourth meeting. However, in view of the many difficulties, the negotiations will inevitably take an extremely long time. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita paid a visit to Prime Minister Hirota today to discuss the recent situation between China and Japan. It is scheduled that the Three Ministers Conference will be held on the 13th, and at that time, Kuwashima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will return to Tokyo to report everything. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shimizu, Secretary of the Japanese Embassy, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th for a conversation, and left after half an hour.

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Newspaper Reports that Britain Intends to Reintroduce the Nine-Power Treaty; British Authorities Have Formally Denied This; Japanese Foreign Minister Will Issue a Statement to the Outside World <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the Kokumin Shimbun published a news item with an extremely eye-catching headline, stating that after the recent meeting in Nanjing between Kawagoe, the Japanese Ambassador to China, and Zhang Qun, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Britain immediately suggested to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty that they jointly lodge a protest with Japan for violating the treaty. When reporters from the Kokumin Shimbun gathered at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, someone asked about this matter. According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the statement in the Kokumin Shimbun that Britain plans to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty is actually inaccurate. The Kokumin Shimbun also mentioned that this matter is a "large-scale international conspiracy of the faithless British, who are actually begging for help from the Nine-Power Treaty in order to hinder the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations." The newspaper said that this news was "based on reliable reports received by the Japanese government" and claimed that the main content of the British note to the other signatory countries was to explain that Japan is now demanding from China the right to station troops in the Yangtze River basin and the complete independence of North China. The newspaper continued, "It is heard that the United States has decided to reject the British proposal." According to the newspaper, the Japanese government felt a painful shock at the British action. Foreign Minister Arita has instructed diplomatic representatives stationed in the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to convey to the governments of the countries where they are stationed that the Japanese government believes that its proposal to China is fair and reasonable and does not infringe on the rights and interests of other signatory countries in China. The main content of the Arita Foreign Minister's declaration is to state that Japan has not demanded the right to station troops in the Yangtze River basin or the complete independence of the five provinces of North China, but only makes reasonable demands for maintaining the special relationship existing between North China, Japan, and "Manchukuo."

<p>(London) Today, the British authorities formally denied that the British government had consulted with the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and intended to invoke the provisions guaranteeing the territorial and administrative integrity of China, in order to refute the rumors published in the Japanese Kokumin Shimbun.

<p>(Tokyo) Today's Kokumin Shimbun has an extremely eye-catching headline, which states that after the recent meeting in Nanjing between Kawagoe, the Japanese Ambassador to China, and Zhang Jun, the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Britain immediately suggested to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty that they jointly protest against Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty. The newspaper also said that this discovery can expose "the large-scale international conspiracy of the faithless British, who are actually begging for help from the Nine-Power Treaty in order to hinder the progress of Sino-Japanese negotiations." According to the Nine-Power Treaty, which was signed in Washington on February 6, 1922, all signatory countries must respect the sovereignty, independence, territory, and administrative integrity of China.

<p>(London) Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Fujii, recently met with a senior official of the Foreign Office for a long time, lasting 45 minutes. The authorities subsequently announced that the British government had not made proposals to Washington and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, requesting that a protest be lodged with the Japanese government, accusing it of pursuing policies towards China that violate this treaty. Regarding this matter, although a certain Japanese newspaper had published it, British Foreign Office personnel did not comment on it, believing that the British government's views on the Sino-Japanese dispute could be clarified by this trip of the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Fujii.

<p>(Tokyo) Ishibashi Tanzan, editor-in-chief of the Toyo Keizai Shimpo, wrote an article today published in the Chugai Commercial News, entitled "Hopes for Contact Between the Press to Adjust Sino-Japanese Relations," criticizing Japanese newspapers for turning a deaf ear to the joint telegram issued by newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong-Hankou. Ishibashi said that broad-sense defense has recently become a fashionable term. However, it is not known that in diplomatic affairs, there is also broad-sense diplomacy, and newspapers are the most powerful tool of broad-sense diplomacy. Unfortunately, Japanese newspapers are able to destroy relations between Japan and foreign countries, and have no intention of maintaining international relations. Japanese newspapers now embrace extreme patriotism and have almost become diplomatic organs of bureaucratic politics. Newspapers should guide national diplomacy in a broad sense and promote international understanding among the people of various countries as a basis for mutual friendship. Ishibashi then sincerely hoped that the newspapers of the two countries would reach an understanding, with Chinese newspapers not publishing anti-Japanese news and Japanese newspapers not making malicious criticisms of China. He also believed that if the newspapers of the two countries established contact, it could promote the improvement of international relations between the two countries. The author then expressed deep concern about the prospects of Sino-Japanese negotiations, saying that if Japan's negotiation strategy proves to be clumsy, the danger of the Twenty-One Demands will almost be repeated, and Japan's misfortune will be far greater than that of China. Ishibashi then criticized Foreign Minister Arita's declaration of September 28, saying that China is now at a crossroads as to whether it should join hands with Japan. He said that Arita did not consider the fact that Japan itself is also at an important crossroads, which is really being good at blaming others but oblivious to his own responsibilities. The Sino-Japanese crisis is the crisis of East Asia, and it is also the hidden danger of the world crisis. In general, this article is sufficient to represent the public opinion of the majority of the people, so it is extremely noteworthy. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">American Newspaper Comments on Japan's Record in China; All Countries Should Strive for Frank Handling; Japan Asks All Countries to Recognize Its Aggression as Reasonable; It Is Too Much to Expect That Humanity Is Easily Deceived <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Shanghai-based National American News Agency dispatch from New York on the 12th, an editorial in the New York Times on October 3, entitled "Japan's Record in China," solemnly declared that Western countries should strive for a frank handling of the impact of Japan's actions in China. After elaborating on the extreme importance of this point, the newspaper cited various acts of aggression by Japan since the time of the Twenty-One Demands. Regarding the recent anti-Japanese riots by Chinese people, it said that Chinese people have long suppressed their resentment towards the aggressor country, and the recent atrocities are a manifestation of this resentment. The newspaper then discussed the content of the Twenty-One Demands and the process by which China did not fully accept them. It then described the Washington Conference, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the naval disarmament treaty, and asked the aforementioned treaty to make Japan guarantee with its honor not to infringe on China again. Although Japan had complied with the policy of good neighborliness for ten years, in 1931, it occupied the three northeastern provinces despite the protests of Western countries and the condemnation of the League of Nations. In 1933, Japanese forces extended south of the Great Wall due to the Tanggu Agreement. In 1935, the Nanjing army was forced to withdraw from North China due to the He-Umezu Agreement. In the winter of 1935, Japanese officials re-promoted the establishment of an independent government in North China, but due to Chinese resistance and the concern shown by the United Kingdom and the United States, it failed. However, after this trend, smuggling was rampant, affecting the business of Westerners in China and reducing Chinese customs revenue. The agency’s commentary concluded that the policies stated by Japan in the Twenty-One Demands and implemented since 1931 have caused China’s hatred to increase with each year. Japan’s repeated and blatant violations of Chinese sovereignty have made public sentiment increasingly excited. Under these circumstances, what is surprising is that there are only so few cases of Japanese citizens being attacked, not so many. It also said that the Japanese government solemnly asks all countries to recognize its aggression as reasonable, and that it is too much to expect that humanity is easily deceived.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 45th weekly memorial service for Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 a.m. on the 12th. The meeting was attended by Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Lin Yungan, Liu Jiwen, Fang Zhi, Xiao Tongzi, Zhang Chong, Zhang Chaojun, Gan Naiguang, Zhu Peide, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Lifu, Wang Boqun, Xu Enzeng, He Yingqin, Li Zonghuang, and all staff members, totaling more than 700 people. Dai Chuanxian led the ceremony as the chairman and reported, saying that he was sent to accompany the World Games delegation abroad and only returned after five months. Now, he will give a brief report to everyone on his impressions of China's participation in the World Games. He decided that Chinese athletes who participated in the World Games and those who went abroad with the delegation to inspect sports totaled more than 100 people, and that overseas Chinese and embassy and consulate staff from various European countries went to Berlin to visit the World Games. Also as many as seven or eight hundred people, this grand event is an unprecedented feat in our country and gives a good impression to the international community, which is gratifying to us. As for the reason why our athletes failed to win this time, it was because they lacked experience in advance, so all preparations were unsatisfactory, such as the hasty time, the athletes suffered more than ten days of sea waves, and only rested for a week before the competition upon arriving in Berlin, coupled with unfamiliar venues, German diet not to their liking, and no doctor to guide them, their performance should be slightly inferior, and the biggest reason is that the physical fitness of the Chinese people is not as good as others, not that there are technical errors. The failure of football is a clear example. Personally, I believe that in the future, we should urgently train sports teachers and pay attention to physiology and hygiene, so that they can be combined with sports. This type of sports teacher school must be strictly trained using military methods, and domestic physicians should use physiological and hygiene science to study the development of sports. Only in this way can the World Games be comparable to countries around the world. I will decide to prepare a written report on the detailed plan, and I hope that all comrades will promote it unanimously. The meeting was adjourned after Dai's speech.

After leading the ceremony, Chairman Lin gave a speech on "How to Enrich National Power." He first said that the failure of our country to participate in this year's World Games cannot be attributed to the poor skills of a few athletes. It is related to the sports of the people across the country. This is not just a question of honor or disgrace in the Games, but a question of the strength or weakness of the entire Chinese nation in physical strength, which is also a question related to the survival of the nation. If we want to revitalize the nation, we must increase the population. But fundamentally, we must first seek to improve the health of the people. If we want to improve the health of the people, we can only promote the development of national sports. The purpose of sports is not only to exercise physical fitness, but also to pay attention to the cultivation of character and the cultivation of personality. In terms of the individual, it is to cultivate the spirit of courage, aggressiveness, perseverance, and adventure. In terms of the group, it is to cultivate the habits of being united, striving, and abiding by discipline. If the people of the country are physically strong, it is the foundation for national revival. We must actively promote sports in the future and restore traditional sports methods, such as boxing, horse riding, etc., and pay attention to group training. The people of the whole country are under unified organization and unified leadership to enrich the strength of the national group and complete the task of revitalizing the nation.

<h3 id="e64">Tragedy in Austria <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Vienna, the Austrian capital, the day before yesterday, the Austrian cabinet held an emergency meeting. It has granted the greatest authority to Chancellor Schuschnigg, creating Schuschnigg's sole personal dictatorship. At the same time, the Homeland Security Force and other political and military organizations were dissolved. Prince Starhemberg, the leader of the Homeland Security Force, has fled abroad, ending his political life. This important change seems to have brought the internal disputes in Austria over the past few months or years to an end. In the future, there may be a more stable situation in this vital piece of land in Central Europe. However, if we examine Austria's internal and external affairs more deeply, we will feel that Austria, situated between two fascist ambitious nations, will inevitably be at the mercy of others and become a victim of aggression if it does not have an independent internal and external policy. In other words, its fate will forever be a tragedy.</p>
<p>Naturally, when we look back at history, we know that Austria since the Great War has had its territory greatly reduced and its economic destiny controlled by Britain and France, and has long been trapped in a tragic situation. However, we will see that Austria's greater tragedy began in 1934. Originally, Austria after the war was governed by the Social Democratic Party. Although the social policies implemented were not thorough, they were still much more progressive than the capitalist countries of Western Europe. In particular, the workers' dormitories in Vienna benefited 500,000 civilians and gained very good international reputation. However, this aroused the jealousy of Italy. In February 1934, Dollfuss, who called himself a "little Napoleon," used international fascism as his background to eliminate the Social Democratic Party and create a dictatorship. However, the expansion of Dollfuss' power aroused the concerns of the German National Socialist Party. In June of the same year, a National Socialist coup occurred in Vienna, and Dollfuss was also tragically killed. However, the intrusion of the National Socialist forces into Austria was not tolerated by Britain, France, and Italy. Therefore, although the National Socialists killed Dollfuss, the coup did not succeed. At this time, Britain and France supported Schuschnigg, whom they favored, to maintain the independent situation. Italy, on the other hand, used Prince Starhemberg as a tool to strengthen the power of his semi-fascist Homeland Security Force, seemingly becoming the protector of the semi-colonial Austria. This complicated situation, due to the serious threat of the National Socialist Party, caused the contradictions between France and Italy to transform into understanding, and surprisingly maintained for nearly two years. However, Austria's independence was only nominal. It was a well-known fact that its internal and external policies had to obey the actual rulers. The most obvious example is that when the League of Nations resolved to impose sanctions on Italy, Austria, intimidated by the power of its strong neighbor, did not dare to participate at all. The loss of diplomatic autonomy by a semi-colonial country can be seen from this.</p>
<p>On July 11 of this year, the German-Austrian Compromise Agreement was concluded, which was actually initiated by Italy. This negotiation was carried out as a result of Mussolini summoning Schuschnigg to the Rocca delle Camminate villa on June 5 to personally instruct him. As for the downfall of Prince Starhemberg, the tragic consequences of a semi-colonial country having no autonomy in its internal affairs are even more evident. Originally, Starhemberg's rise to power was due to Italy's desire to use him. However, recently Starhemberg suddenly had personal ambitions, hoping to become the regent after the restoration of the Austrian monarchy. This aroused Italy's disgust. Therefore, Schuschnigg seized the opportunity to exclude the disgraced Starhemberg. However, now, due to the result of the German-Austrian Compromise, the power of the National Socialist Party has gradually increased in the Austrian cabinet. Schuschnigg's own fate is as unreliable as Starhemberg's. The compromise between the two fascist ambitious nations, Italy and Germany, on the Austrian issue will eventually break down and return to the original sharp struggle.</p>
<p>In short, from the current changes in the Austrian political situation, what we see is always a tragedy caused by a semi-colonial country not struggling towards the road of independence and freedom. Our country is currently standing at such a crossroads. We should also take the lesson of Austria as a serious warning.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Administrative Reform Plan: The Japanese Political Situation Is Seriously Undercut; The Current Cabinet Tries Its Best to Compile the Budget; The Military and the Prime Minister Disagree <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government and the military have conflicting opinions on the issue of reforming the administrative structure, which may lead to a political crisis. This is a major political issue. According to the opinions of Prime Minister Hirota and other cabinet members, the current cabinet should do its best to ensure the successful completion of next year's budget. However, dealing with the issue of reforming the administrative organs before the budget issue is resolved will hinder the compilation of next year's budget. Therefore, compiling the budget is the prior problem. The military's proposed plan to reform the administrative organs should only be considered after next year's budget. However, the military holds the opposite view, believing that the government's delay in reforming the issue violates the spirit of revitalizing the administration. The military's opinions are quite strong. It is noteworthy whether Prime Minister Hirota can reach a compromise when negotiating with them. (Kyodo News, December 12)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Terauchi recently submitted a plan to reform the administrative organs. The political circles are debating this fiercely, and it is feared that it will eventually lead to a serious political crisis. The plan has attracted the deep attention of the whole country. At the same time, some people have refuted it, saying that it cannot be implemented. However, the military is determined to achieve its goals. However, those in the cabinet who oppose the Army Minister's plan occupy considerable power. Although the Prime Minister has the sincerity to follow the military's proposal, he also firmly believes that this plan cannot be fully endorsed, and at least must be delayed for some time. The public wants to implement this reform, and the cabinet can only resign en masse. However, the Prime Minister believes that at this time of international tension, it is not appropriate to rashly change the cabinet. It is currently difficult to predict how this matter will develop. (Reuters, December 12)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army authorities' attitude on the issue of reforming the administrative structure is quite strong. After Army Minister Terauchi returned to Tokyo on the 12th, this issue must have a concrete development. The specific guidelines of the Army Ministry's proposal to establish a minister without portfolio are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The first method to control important national policy agencies is to merge the current Investigation Bureau, Legislative Bureau, Resources Bureau, Statistics Bureau, Information Committee, and part of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, and create a Resources Bureau, Planning Bureau, and Budget Bureau, with a director-general to control these three bureaus.</p>
<p>(2) The second method is to establish a General Affairs Office, with the above three bureaus as its internal bureaus.</p>
<p>(3) The third method is to integrate the Resources Bureau and the Investigation Bureau as an agency to control important national policies.</p>
<p>(4) Appoint a person with the qualifications of Deputy Prime Minister as Minister without Portfolio to manage this agency.</p>
<p>(5) Or appoint a person with the qualifications of Chief of Staff as its director-general. (Kyodo News, December 12)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Army Minister Terauchi, who inspected various places after the Grand Maneuvers, returned to Tokyo on the night of the 12th. He was away from Tokyo for three weeks. Regarding the practical negotiations on reforming the administrative structure, relations with China, and the next year's army budget, the current important issues facing the army need to listen to the various situations when leaving Tokyo. On the way, he decided to summon Commander Umezu in the car and had important discussions on the attitude the army should take in the future. At the cabinet meeting on the 13th, the Army Minister will meet with Prime Minister Hirota to exchange views on the important issues that were interrupted due to the Grand Maneuvers. Therefore, the attitude of the Army Minister towards reforming the administrative structure in the future is worthy of attention. Therefore, the situation will have an active development with the Army Minister's return to Tokyo as an opportunity. (Kyodo News, December 12)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa met with Prime Minister Hirota on the morning of the 12th and exchanged various views on the issue of reforming the structure of the Trade Bureau. However, the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have always disagreed on this issue. Therefore, Minister of Commerce and Industry Ogawa urged the Prime Minister to take the lead in mediation. However, according to the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs consulted by Prime Minister Hirota, the two authorities have reached a consensus in principle on the matter of seeking the unification of trade administration. Therefore, the Prime Minister ordered the Investigation Bureau to investigate the bureau system of the Trade Bureau. The Investigation Bureau is now preparing a compromise plan with reference to the original plan of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the objections of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The compromise plan will be drafted soon. Therefore, Prime Minister Hirota may make a decision, and the compromise plan will be largely jointly managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and will largely approach the plan of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and will be finalized before the compilation of the next year's budget.

<p>(Tokyo) Sasaki, the director of the South Manchuria Railway Company, came to Tokyo the other day to request the government to pay the unpaid installments of all its shares. The Ministry of Finance is still considering this due to financial difficulties. However, the military believes that the government should pay the money immediately to implement the policy towards Manchuria, that is, investing in Manchuria is one of the important national policies of the government. Minister of Finance Baba is also strongly promoting the development of Manchurian industries, so appropriate methods should be considered as soon as possible. It is said that the Ministry of Finance is now refusing to pay the money, which is very unreasonable. The South Manchuria Railway Company is a national policy company with both government and private capital. Its business is the government's national policy. The government must immediately find a way to enable the South Manchuria Railway to implement its business plan. (Kyodo News, December 12)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The five-year plan for the development of Manchurian industries, which will begin next year, has an estimated budget of 1.5 billion yuan. The funds, in addition to issuing domestic debt, can only rely on Japan's investment in Manchuria. The mobilization of funds required is as follows: (1) The government, in addition to issuing a minimum of 300 million yuan of domestic and foreign debt, hopes to set new taxes, increase official industry income and natural income, and raise a total of 500 million yuan. (2) The South Manchuria Railway Company will be solely responsible for transportation, railways, coal and other heavy industries of 500 million yuan. (3) Private investment from mainland Japan in various industries will be 300 million yuan. (4) New financial institutions will be established, and funds of 200 million yuan can be raised by issuing bonds and mobilizing deposits. As for the industrial and transportation aspects of this plan, pure official operations and special company capital increases, or new establishments, will await government, South Manchuria Railway, and Japanese private investment. As for the agricultural and animal husbandry aspects, the dualistic guidance of the government and the South Manchuria Railway will be changed. Encouragement will be given to follow the direction of the five-year plan. Under the guidance of the government, the South Manchuria Railway will provide technical assistance and engage in developing agriculture and increasing livestock production.

<p>(Dalian) The "Manchukuo" government is now raising 150 million yen each in domestic and foreign debt in order to implement the five-year plan for industrial development, and has decided to levy income tax on salaried employees. It has not yet been announced when this tax will be levied. It will probably be within two years. This income will be very considerable. It is estimated that the total annual income of salaried employees in Manchuria (including the Kwantung Leased Territory) is no less than 250 million yuan. It is now believed that when this tax is levied in the future, foreigners residing in Manchuria will also have to pay this tax. (Reuters, December 12)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Since the beginning of the year, Korean crops have suffered from cold damage, followed by droughts, and because of wind and flood disasters, low temperatures and excessive humidity, there have been pests and diseases, as well as hailstorms. These have occurred continuously, resulting in total damages of 74.2002 million yuan from April to early October this year. In addition, part of the previous wind and flood disaster has not been reported, so the amount of damage to crops this year will inevitably exceed 100 million yuan and surpass the highest record of 55 million yuan in Showa 9 (1934).

<p>(Berlin) The closeness of Sino-German relations in recent years and the German people's strong interest in China can be seen at the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China held by Ambassador Cheng at the International House last night. There were hundreds of German celebrities attending, including former Minister to Peiping Erdmannsdorff, Department Chief Lahlmann of the National Socialist Party in China, Dr. Linde, Vice Chairman of the Far East Association, Admiral Lietzmann, Chairman of the Chinese Academic Research Society, Former Minister to Peiping and current President of the Frankfurt Chinese Society Pochlo, as well as many representatives from the German Ministry of Defense and the Law School. The celebration was hosted by the Chinese Students Association in Germany and the German Geological Society. In the evening, General Foppel, Chairman of the German Geological Society, delivered a welcome speech, followed by a speech by Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang. Cheng pointed out the similarities between China and Germany in political development. Ambassador Cheng said that when the Republic of China was founded twenty-five years ago, some people were skeptical, saying that it was doubtful whether this ancient nation, which had been subject to thousands of years of autocratic monarchy, could implement democracy. However, twenty-five years of experience have proved that the foundation of the Republic of China is indeed built on a great stone. He also said, "The progress of Chinese politics is like the growth of human beings. Childhood has passed, and we have entered adolescence. Therefore, we have great hope for the future of China." At this point, Ambassador Cheng presented a national flag to the Mayor of Berlin, Lippert, as a souvenir. In his reply, Lippert said that the Chinese national flag and the German one both symbolize national ideals and were determined by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He also said, "I hereby assure the Chinese Ambassador and the Chinese people with sincerity that this Chinese national flag will always occupy a glorious place in the International House."

<p>Seoul: The Korean Army Headquarters announced that on the 11th, the "Manchukuo" border surveillance team and the Soviet border police had a conflict in two places on the Soviet-Manchurian border in Jiandao Province. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) At 5:30 a.m. on the 11th, while a detachment of the "Manchukuo" border surveillance team was monitoring the border near Jiusha Ping in Yangguan Ping, across the river from Gucheng, that is, near the Soviet-Manchurian border, they were suddenly shot at by the Soviet border police. The surveillance team resisted and returned fire. One person was injured. The Soviet side also suffered considerable damage, abandoning a total of eight dead and wounded in Manchurian territory. At present, both the Soviet and Manchurian sides have increased their troops, and their surveillance posts are confronting the Soviet troops in Yangguan Ping and the barracks. The distance between them is 500 meters.</p>
<p>(2) On the afternoon of the 11th, near the 12th marker on the border line southeast of Madida, while the Manchurian border surveillance team was monitoring the border, they were suddenly shot at by the Soviet army. One member of the surveillance team was killed in action. The damage to the Soviet army is unknown. The fighting between the two sides has stopped since 5:30 p.m. on the 11th. The two sides are waiting in formation with the border line separating them by 200 meters.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese army is taking comprehensive countermeasures. (Kyodo News, December 12)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese authorities concerned are quite indignant at the stubborn attitude of the Soviet Union. However, the reason why the Soviet Union has recently adopted a proactive attitude on the eastern border is to contain Sino-Japanese negotiations.

<p>Darwin Harbor: New Zealand's young female aviator, Ms. Batten, flew into here at 1:13 this morning, setting a solo flight record from Britain to Australia, covering the entire journey in five days, twenty-two hours and two minutes. When the lady landed, because the aircraft had an accident, after rapidly circling the field once, it stopped immediately. The audience nearby were all alarmed and at a loss, but Ms. Batten still had a smile on her face when she got off the plane, without any sign of panic, and said that she was very pleased to be able to break the previous solo flight record by 24 hours. She now intends to continue flying back to her hometown in New Zealand. This wish may be difficult to realize, because the Melbourne Civil Aviation Association opposes single-engine aircraft flying across the thousand-mile Tasman Sea. Ms. Batten took off from Lympne airfield in Kent, England, early last Monday, intending to shorten the record she had previously set from Britain to Australia. Unexpectedly, Ms. Batten made an amazing improvement, breaking the previous solo flight record by almost a full day. The highest solo flight record between Britain and Australia was held by Broadbent, with a time of six days, twenty-one hours and nineteen minutes. The flight record between Britain and Australia made by Batten herself in May 1934 was fourteen days and twenty-three hours. The aircraft she is piloting this time is the one she used to cross the South Atlantic from Dakar to Brazil in November 1935. (Reuters, December 12)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Arctic navigation season this year has come to a successful conclusion. The number of ships navigating the Northern Sea Route throughout the season has doubled compared to last year. Although there was a lot of ice this year, making navigation difficult, all ships were able to reach their destinations completely, and no ships stayed in the Arctic to overwinter. Water transport in the Kara Sea was also very successful. Many foreign ships also participated in the navigation. During this season, the icebreaker "Rusanov" sailed to the northernmost tip of Franz Josef Land twice in one season. The journey was very difficult. The results of this season's navigation have shown that the Northern Sea Route can be used regularly under any ice conditions. In the future, cargo transport in northern Soviet Union will increase year by year.

<p>Madrid – General Franco's rebel forces, under artillery cover, advanced along the Tagus River today in the rain. Rebel fighter planes flew north from Oviedo, strafing government forces' defenses with machine guns. However, due to a counter-offensive by government troops in Navalpilar, the rebel advance was somewhat stalled. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Madrid – A special dispatch from our correspondent with the army on the front lines of Gabelos, San Martín, and two other towns in Teclesis, west of the capital, reports that heavy rain has been falling continuously since last night and this morning. Government and national forces are still engaged in fierce fighting along the entire front, with artillery and machine gun units being particularly active. Although national forces are applying pressure, government troops are resisting fiercely, refusing to yield even an inch of ground. The International Red Cross rescue teams are providing effective aid on the battlefield. During the intense fighting, two shepherd boys escaped from the national forces' positions to the government side. They stated that they had been seeking refuge in the national forces' occupied area and possessed national forces' passes. The national forces ordered them to provide milk every morning, and they took advantage of the opportunity to cross the fire line and escape here. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Madrid – There are currently 40,000 militiamen in the capital preparing to defend against a large-scale rebel offensive, confident that they will defeat the "followers of Hitler and Mussolini" in the final battle. The main rebel force is reportedly preparing to march on Madrid. It is expected that rebel commander General Franco may launch a major offensive today, as it is the day the Spanish nation celebrates the anniversary of the discovery of America. Meanwhile, Spanish refugees are returning home in large numbers. French newspapers estimate that the number of refugees who fled to France has decreased from 10,000 to 5,000, as the French government is willing to provide them with funds to return to Catalonia or Irún. Yesterday, 120 women from Bilbao and San Sebastian, who had gone to Saint-Jean-de-Luz on the Franco-Spanish border as hostages for exchange mediated by Argentine Ambassador Mancilla, returned to Spain. Also, the ship "Niassa," carrying 1,400 Spanish government soldiers who had fled into Portugal, set sail from Lisbon for Tarragona. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) – It was learned here today that twenty Spanish rebel aircraft are bombing Madrid, causing heavy damage within the capital. An Associated Press reporter was at the telephone bureau at the time and was unable to leave due to the external danger. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Oviedo – Since the city was captured by government forces, national forces have continued to occupy the central district, engaging in street fighting with government troops. As of today, the fighting remains intense. Furthermore, it is rumored that national forces from nearby areas will soon begin an offensive towards Madrid. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Hengtai – Spanish government forces today are pressing closer to the center of Oviedo. The initial 2,500 rebel soldiers have been reduced to less than 800. Yesterday, they vowed to die rather than surrender. Government forces stated that since the rebels were determined, they would help them fulfill their wish. How could they not die when trapped in a desperate situation? Government forces are now preparing to use landmines to bomb the rebels' last stronghold. Three miners used an armored vehicle to carry 1,000 pounds of explosives into a rebel ammunition depot, destroying a machine gun nest and killing 36 rebels. The three miners also perished. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid – According to semi-official news today, the rebels in Oviedo have been trapped in the heart of the city. A large rebel reinforcement force arrived on Sunday, but miners from the province of Asturias engaged them in fierce hand-to-hand combat with hand grenades and machine guns, repelling the rebel reinforcements after a day of intense fighting. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Seville – A reinforcement column from Cádiz is currently advancing towards Oviedo. Although government forces are fiercely attacking Oviedo and engaging in street fighting within the city, national forces are facing difficulties due to their unfamiliarity with the local terrain. Nevertheless, the reinforcement column is still advancing towards the city to relieve the siege of Oviedo. Also, yesterday, the national forces' cruiser "Admiral Cervera" sank two small government warships in the Strait of Gibraltar. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem – The general strike throughout the region is scheduled to end today. City residents gathered in various churches yesterday to hold special prayers of thanksgiving to God. This morning, church bells rang loudly, expressing joy. The decision to end the strike was made on Saturday and Sunday after three meetings of the Arab Higher Committee and the local Arab National Committee. At that time, it was unanimously decided to accept the joint appeal letters from King Ibn Saud of Hejaz, King Abdullah of Transjordan, and King Ghazi of Iraq. Many illegal incidents have occurred in the past 24 hours. The British army barracks in Bethlehem were also shot at. British soldiers returned fire, killing two Arabs. On Friday night, Arabs attacked a convoy of armored vehicles south of Jerusalem, injuring three British soldiers and one British patrol officer. The authorities ordered the town of Hebron to pay a collective fine of £1,000 as a punitive measure. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem – Arabs in Palestine have resumed work today after a six-month strike. The doors of shops have been opened, for the first time since spring. Streetcars of Arab companies have resumed operation. However, violence has not completely stopped. There are still sniper incidents in Jewish residential areas. Last night, a Jewish policeman was shot and killed. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem – The Arab people in Palestine, due to their opposition to Jewish immigration, have been on strike since April this year, for almost half a year. Recently, after mediation by the kings of four Arab countries, Hejaz, Yemen, Iraq, and Transjordan, the Arab Higher Committee here decided yesterday to end the strike. The tribe's newspapers recently commented on this matter, all celebrating "the victory of the strike movement." The Jewish newspapers said that the government had not accepted any of the requests made by the Arab tribe, which showed that the tribe's actions had failed. However, it is generally believed that the kings of the countries must have provided some kind of promise to the Arabs here, which led to the success of the mediation. All stores run by Arabs in Jerusalem and the port of Haifa have reopened today. Construction projects that had been suspended for six months have also been resumed. The atmosphere is renewed. However, the long period of unrest and economic decline is regrettable for everyone. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) – Authorities estimate that the general strike in Palestine has resulted in the deaths of 300 people and injuries to over 1,000. It has now been announced that the strike has ended. British newspapers are delighted by this news and praise the success of the three Arab kings' mediation, as well as the British army commander in Palestine, Lieutenant General Dill, for not resorting to force lightly during the negotiations. According to British government announcements, fairness is paramount, and the three Arab kings have expressed their trust in the British government's goodwill. Commentators are echoing this view, but ignore the fact that British goodwill must be supported by concessions and compromises from both sides in Palestine in order to be effective. As the "Morning Post" stated, the policies implemented by the Palestine Mandate government have never been able to create peace and may need to be greatly modified based on their results. The "Daily News" stated that while the mandate may be able to maintain order when the Jewish and Arab nations are at odds, it will ultimately not be able to create peace and prosperity.

<p>Lens – Prime Minister Léon Blum came here today to attend the opening ceremony of a new hospital. The Socialist Party took the opportunity to convene a mass rally in the city's sports field, inviting the Prime Minister to deliver a speech. Nearly 50,000 people attended. In his speech, the Prime Minister said, "The economic and financial reform plan of the current government not only abandons the methods adopted by the previous parliament but also goes against them. In short, all the measures we have taken are aimed at increasing national income and the purchasing power of the masses." Regarding domestic affairs, Léon Blum said, "The main characteristic of the Popular Front government is to seek lasting cooperation with the masses and local professional organizations, because only local professional organizations can truly represent public opinion." The Prime Minister expressed optimism about the near future of the Popular Front, saying that the unity of the Popular Front is stronger than ever before. The Prime Minister continued to describe the achievements of the government in reforming general affairs, saying that among the various reform plans, the most difficult to implement was the law on a 40-hour work week. This law will be implemented first in various coal mines on November 1, and then gradually extended to the metallurgical, textile, and construction industries. The Prime Minister also said, "Once the two houses of parliament reconvene, we will quickly implement the tax reform plan. If you learn about the various measures planned by Finance Minister Olivoir, you will know that the government is by no means indecisive and tolerant. Moreover, the current experiment of the government is an experiment for the entire working class. To what extent the ideas of the working class affect the current political and social system will be determined by this experiment. As for those who regard the workers as a privileged class in society, their intention is to make the interests of workers and farmers mutually opposed. This kind of propaganda must be opposed, because if workers and farmers are opposed to each other, reactionary forces will inevitably seize the opportunity to make a comeback. The historical facts of the Second Republic in France from 1848 to 1851 are a sufficient lesson." Léon Blum reiterated various social reform policies, saying, "The government's proposed method of resolving labor-capital disputes through compulsory arbitration is actually beneficial to employers. Now, the employees have accepted it, but the employers have uniquely opposed it, which is quite incomprehensible. If it is said that employers must want to instigate internal social conflicts, or even want to restore the long-abandoned doctrine of employer supremacy, I really cannot believe it. If so, we will never be able to allow it, because the government enforces the law strictly, and once reform plans are promulgated, there is no possibility of reversing the decision." In conclusion, he said, "What I believe in and adhere to is only democracy, peace, and human dignity, only social justice. In order to realize social justice, I will do my best."

<p>(London) – Communist Party members paraded through the East End of London today, expressing opposition to fascism and celebrating Sunday's victory. Fascist Party members also paraded in Liverpool. No major disturbances occurred at either demonstration, with only a few people injured and several arrested for minor clashes. However, by the evening, hundreds of young people in the East End of London suddenly smashed the glass windows of fifteen shops owned by Jews in Ridell Street and looted the goods of several shops. By the time the police arrived at the scene in a public bus after hearing the alarm, the rioters had disappeared without a trace. A total of 5,000 men and women participated in today's Communist Party parade, led by 500 veterans, followed by 2,000 police officers and mounted police. Starting from the tower factory, they went to Victoria Park. A large number of police officers were lined up along the road, and the audience blocked the road. The military band played the Communist Party marching song, and the demonstrating party members sang left-wing songs and shouted slogans to defeat Mosley (leader of the British Fascist Party) and his black-shirted thugs. The demonstration by Fascist Party members in Liverpool kept the local police even busier. Although there were hundreds of police officers and mounted police protecting them on all sides as they marched, anti-fascists threw sharp objects at them. The police had no choice but to use batons to disperse the crowds. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Opposition to Nationalizing British Armaments <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(London) – The Cabinet previously appointed a special committee on armaments manufacturing to study the issue of nationalizing the armaments industry. Well-informed sources have recently announced that the committee has submitted a report opposing the proposal for nationalization. There are three reasons for this: (1) This move would cause the government to waste huge sums of money to strengthen armaments, but it may not be effective in national defense. (2) This move would force the government to constantly hire a huge number of workers, who may even receive salaries for doing nothing. (3) This move would allow the arms industry to be controlled by the political situation and not maintain its independent nature. In addition, the committee advocates that in times of war, the government should absolutely control the armaments industry and mobilize capital to meet emergency needs. However, in peacetime, the following system may be adopted: (1) The government may recognize the armaments industry as a public utility and control it within a considerable scope. (2) When foreign countries order armaments from British factories, the government agencies should investigate the quantity ordered and the transaction price, so as to avoid the factories from obtaining excessive profits. (3) The laws on merchants applying for armaments export licenses should be strictly revised, so that the government can implement various supervision methods, such as refusing to supply armaments to semi-civilized countries.

<h3 id="e90">Actions Toward Chahar and Suiyuan After the Jiabusi Conference; Mongol Bandits and Puppet Troops All Receive Assistance; The Situation in the Five Counties East of Suiyuan Becomes Increasingly Serious <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shangdu reveals that Wang Ying's bandit troops, who are plotting to invade westward, have been organized under the protection of a certain country. Their designation has also been confirmed, namely the so-called Northwest Anti-Communist Autonomous Army, with Wang Ying serving as the puppet commander. His troops consist of two cavalry brigades, one infantry brigade, and one special service regiment, totaling over 5,500 men. Zhang Wanqing, Yu Zihe, and others serve as brigade commanders, with Zhang also serving as the puppet deputy commander. Wang Ying himself is still attending the conference convened by De Wang in Jiabusi and has not yet returned. He will likely not stay longer than three or two days and will return soon. The seriousness of the situation in the five counties east of Suiyuan is feared to escalate as a result. It is heard that Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan, has stationed arrangements in the area east of Suiyuan. If Wang attempts to invade westward, it will be difficult for him to succeed.</p>
<p>The conference in Jiabusi, for the situation of Chahar north and Suiyuan east, does not belong to a simple, local problem, but the expansion of its background involves the entire national policy, which makes the conference in Jiabusi extremely important. It is now learned that the conference concluded on the 7th of this month, and the military and political leaders of various bandits and puppets have all returned to their original stationed locations. The important discussions at the conference were the decision on the timing of the invasion of eastern Suiyuan (i.e., the five counties east of Suiyuan), and it has been resolved to gradually increase the military strength on the border between Chahar and Suiyuan from today, advancing westward in stages. As for the salaries and supplies of the puppet bandit troops, a small portion of it depends on the local collection of autumn taxes and other miscellaneous levies. Other than that, there is no legitimate income. Most of it is supplied by a certain party, with the total amount temporarily set at 700,000 yuan. As for the armaments needed, a certain country has provided a large amount of assistance. On the afternoon of the 6th, 6 million rounds of ammunition arrived in Kangbao and will be transferred to Jiabusi, Zhangbei, and Shangdu in the short term, and then distributed to various troops. On the 9th, 5,000 sets of cotton military uniforms were supplied by a certain group and transported to Zhangbei. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Shantou Japanese Residents' Demands Regarding the Abandoned Bomb Case; Shantou Military and Police Still Not Relaxing Vigilance; Smuggled Drugs Mailed to Shantou <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou is a vital hub for the Japanese's southward advance policy. After the peaceful unification of Guangdong, the Guangzhi Foreign Firm abandoned bomb case occurred. It is said that this incident involved some clever and illusory tactics. For example, last year, a Japanese patrolman named Kakuda died suddenly in Lianhe Lane in Shantou. After examination by a British doctor at the Gospel Hospital, it was confirmed that the deceased's lungs had already rotted and there was no hope of prolonging his life. However, the Japanese side claimed that Kakuda was shot by a sniper. There were many suspicious points, and it remains an unsolved case to this day. Therefore, the Guangzhi Foreign Firm incident may also involve clever and illusory tactics. However, the Japanese merchants in Shantou have adopted an unusually strong stance regarding the Guangzhi Foreign Firm incident. Through a resolution by the Japanese Residents' Association, two points were decided: (1) Strictly arrest the murderers and protect Japanese residents; (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, and incidentally expand the authority of the Japanese police. This was submitted to the city government by Japanese Consul Yamazaki for negotiation. The city government previously sent Huang Jing, a councilor, along with Xiong Jixia, the head of the detective section of the Public Security Bureau, to the Japanese Consulate to repeatedly investigate the origin of the abandoned bomb with Kita, the head of the Japanese police station. They believed there were many points of suspicion, so they did not reply. However, heavily armed military police in Shantou have been stationed in double shifts since the evening of the 17th of last month and have still not relaxed vigilance. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, Kita, the head of the Japanese police, accompanied by an interpreter, visited the Inspectorate of the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the measures taken by Inspector Lian Bingyi regarding the abandoned bomb case and the procedures for Japanese residents to rent houses in Shantou. Lian said that the occurrence of the abandoned bomb was only based on one-sided reports, and there was no evidence to prove that it was thrown from the outside. Because the bomb had no firing pin and was a discarded item from ten years ago, and it was found under the kitchen, and the back door and windows were tightly closed, and the guards did not see anyone passing by, there was no basis to prove that it was thrown by someone. As for the issue of foreigners renting houses, the city government will have proper measures soon, etc. Kita left without getting the information he wanted. It is noted that the Japanese's infiltration and activities for their southward advance have been very remarkable recently in several aspects. The year before last, the Japanese established the "Combination Company" in Shantou and "Tonghe" in Hong Kong, specializing in the import of foreign rice and goods with special agricultural taxes. In two years, they made a profit of one million yuan, which greatly impacted the transportation guilds and sundry goods businesses in the north and south ports. The power over grain and foreign trade in Chaozhou and Meizhou was almost entirely in the hands of the Combination Company. After the Guangdong situation was settled, the foreign rice tax was collected by the customs, and the Combination Company was also suspended. Recently, because the Agricultural Tax Bureau has not issued a clear order to cancel, heavy taxes are still levied on soybeans, oil, bean cakes, coconut oil, and miscellaneous grains. Relying on commercial treaties, the Japanese refuse to pay local taxes after reporting to the customs. Last month, the Combination Company was revived, managed by Japanese man Takaji Saburo, who entrusted the Northeast Mitsubishi Corporation to handle the import of oil, soybeans, peanut kernels, etc., making a huge profit. The old shareholders demanded to join, and later, under the guidance and mediation of the Taiwan Development Company of Taiwan, the organization was expanded and renamed the Zhongnan Company, with even more substantial capital than before. Many foreign houses along the coast of Shantou's outer road have been rented at high prices by Taiwanese people through intermediaries, and foreign firm signboards have been hung up, specializing in high-profit businesses. Anything that the Japanese and Koreans operate in Tianjin and Beijing is beginning to take shape in Shantou, such as hotels, bars, and cafes, which are the only gold-consuming dens when smoking and gambling are prohibited. Dancing girls and drugs are active secretly at the same time. The Shantou General Post Office has been receiving a large number of packages containing rayon and pharmaceuticals from Tianjin, Beijing, and Xiamen in recent days. Drugs are hidden in the middle, and the package surfaces are written with the names of certain foreign firms. Postmen have searched all over the city, but no such foreign firm signboards can be found, so they cannot be delivered. However, every two or three days, someone brings a slip and the foreign firm's seal to collect them. Some packages are even sent to small post offices not far from Shantou, which also cannot be delivered. Within two days, someone also comes with a seal to collect them. The purpose is nothing more than to avoid various local taxes, special taxes, and customs inspections. The inflow of drugs also comes from these packages, which is enough to show the deep intentions of a certain country.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Guangdong Province Begins to Rectify Salt Affairs; Transportation Office and Audit Office Merged; Plans to Restore Sales Markets in Hunan Province <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has always been known for its salt production. In its heyday, Guangdong salt was sold to provinces such as Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Most salt-producing areas are located in coastal regions. The most productive areas along the East River are Haifeng, Lufeng, Shanwei, and Huiyang. The most famous salt areas in the Southern Route are Gaolei, Qinlian, and Qiongya. In the past decade, the sales markets in various provinces have gradually been lost. For example, Jiangxi Province has suffered from communist disasters for several years, and the official army has blockaded southern Jiangxi, cutting off the road for Guangdong salt to be sold to Jiangxi. In the northern part of Hunan Province, the import of Huai salt has occurred, while in southern Hunan, heavy salt taxes are levied upon entry, making it impossible for Guangdong salt to sell smoothly. As for Guangxi Province, there has recently been an influx of Vietnamese salt, which is cheap, making it impossible for Guangdong salt to compete. As a result, the road for Guangdong salt to be sold to Guangxi is not as good as before. Due to the above reasons, the export of Guangdong salt has plummeted. In addition, those who have been in charge of salt administration in recent years have lacked long-term plans and only pursued personal gain, leading to the relaxation of salt administration. As a result, Guangdong's salt affairs have become increasingly weakened, leading to the bankruptcy of salt merchants and affecting other commercial industries. In recent years, Guangdong's salt affairs have been in a desperate situation. Recently, the Guangdong situation has been renewed. Chen Weizhou, the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner, has left office. The central government then appointed Tang Haian as his successor. Before long, Tang also left office, and the central government appointed Tang Dong, the manager of the Guangdong Salt Affairs Audit Sub-Office, to serve concurrently as the Liangguang Salt Transport Commissioner. Tang took office on the 5th of this month and was ordered to thoroughly reform the administrative, sales, and anti-smuggling matters within the office. To save public funds, he will reduce staff and merge the Transport Commissioner's Office with the Audit Sub-Office. The monthly expenses of the Transport Commissioner's Office were formerly 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, but now they have been reduced to 8,000 yuan per month. The magistrates of salt fields in various places will also be dismissed, and administrative matters will be handled concurrently by the tax collection offices. The above are administrative reforms. As for anti-smuggling, the entire province will be divided into six to eight anti-smuggling zones, with a tax police team stationed in each zone. The original salt police general team will be dissolved to unify anti-smuggling powers. It has also been decided to send personnel to the salt fields to reorganize them. One method of reorganization is to improve salt quality. The office will send inspection experts to various fields to study and guide them. There are fifteen salt field districts in Guangdong, with varying amounts and qualities of salt. The main salt fields, such as Bobai, Sanya, and Wushi, are planned to be reorganized first. Secondary salt fields, such as Shiqiao, Danshui, Dazhou, Biga, Dianmao, Bomao, Shuang'en, Baishi, and Haishan, will be reorganized and smuggling will be prevented. Salt fields that are not very important, such as Zhaolong, will be abolished. As for improving transportation and sales, it is planned to first build salt warehouses in various places, gradually abolish Cheng boats, and abolish the restriction of evenly distributing 30% to eastern and 70% to western fields, implementing a free transportation and sales system. Sales methods have been discussed with salt merchants in southern Hunan to restore the method of transporting and selling Guangdong salt to thirty-eight counties in southern Hunan. It is also planned to first build salt warehouses in various places in the Southern Route to facilitate the loading, unloading, and storage of salt. As for the Cheng boats used to transport salt, it is still difficult to abolish them all at once. There are currently over a hundred of these Cheng boats. The largest can carry 8,000 bags of salt, while the smallest can carry over 2,400 bags. Each boat employs an average of twenty workers, totaling over 2,000 people who make a living on the salt boats. If the boats are abolished all at once, over 2,000 people will lose their jobs. Therefore, a gradual reform plan is proposed, with fifteen Cheng boats being abolished each year, with the aim of completing the abolition in five years to avoid sudden unemployment for the workers.

<h3 id="e93">Qingdao Cracks Down on Counterfeit Subsidiary Coin Manufacturing Organization; Counterfeiters Xiao Ziyu and Four Others Arrested; All Machinery and Counterfeit Coins Seized <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Recently, there has been a shortage of nickel-quality subsidiary coins on the market, and there have been many counterfeit coins, which are difficult to identify. If strict precautions are not taken, the impact on the national currency and the disruption of finance will be significant. Recently, the city cracked down on a counterfeit banknote manufacturing organization. Yesterday (the 11th), the Public Security Bureau cracked down on a counterfeit subsidiary coin manufacturing organization in Wujiacun, outside the city, and arrested the suspects and seized the evidence on the spot. Xiao Ziyu (45 years old), a native of Jimo, lives at No. 303, Xiwujiacun, outside the city. He used to run a coal mine in Taiping Town. However, since the past year, the market has been depressed, and all industries have been sluggish. Xiao's coal mine has also been greatly affected and cannot be maintained. Therefore, he came up with a whimsical idea and discussed with his friend Li Baoqing and others to raise funds to manufacture counterfeit subsidiary coins in the hope of making a profit. Xiao and Li each contributed 100 yuan as capital, and Xiao found ways to purchase machinery and modeling equipment. To maintain strict secrecy, two rooms were rented at No. 303, Xiwujiacun, outside the city, as a temporary manufacturing plant, and two coppersmiths, Wang Qisheng and Zhang Kequan, were hired to start manufacturing. Zheng Zhibin was hired as a salesman, and a price was set: 40 yuan of legal tender for every 100 yuan of counterfeit subsidiary coins.</p>
<p>A line vendor named Yu ordered 100 yuan of counterfeit subsidiary coins from Zheng and asked Zheng to deliver them to the woods at Haipobridge for exchange. Yesterday (the 11th) at about 11:00 AM, Zheng brought 500 pieces of 20-cent counterfeit subsidiary coins to deliver the goods. When he arrived near Haipobridge, his hurried behavior and abnormal demeanor were noticed by patrol police officers, who immediately searched him. 500 counterfeit subsidiary coins were found on his person, and Zheng was taken to the Fourth Bureau of Public Security for interrogation. Zheng initially denied it cunningly and refused to confess. However, as the evidence was conclusive, he could not deny it and fully confessed the counterfeit subsidiary coin manufacturing organization and his accomplices. The Fourth Bureau sent a patrol officer, Meng Dexuan, and several long-term police officers to search No. 303, Caiyuan, Wujiacun. The suspects Xiao Ziyu, Li Baoqing, Wang Qisheng, and Zhang Kequan were all arrested, and several counterfeit subsidiary coins and counterfeit subsidiary coin manufacturing machines were seized. They were all taken back to the branch for interrogation. Xiao Ziyu and others have confessed without denial. The Fourth Bureau sent all the suspects to the General Bureau on the 12th, and they will be severely punished according to the law to serve as a warning to others.</p>

<p>Young Maid Servants Tragically Abused</p>
<p>Wu Heming of Sijing bought Gu Qiuling, a girl from Wuxi, as a maid for a price of purchase in the 19th year of the Republic. This year, she is only twelve years old and is quite intelligent. From March of this year to the present, she has been raped more than ten times by her employer, Wu Heming. Wu's wife knew about it, but instead helped her husband rape her. Usually, if he occasionally failed, he would beat her. The maid has been living a subhuman life for a long time. On the 11th of this month, Wu's wife's father severely beat Qiuling. Qiuling could not bear it and secretly went to the office of Zhang Huanzhi, a lawyer in Songjiang, to cry out her grievances. Zhang, pitying her situation, reported it to the Fifth Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. The police were dispatched to summon Wu Heming, but Wu was in Shanghai for medical treatment and was not summoned. The station sent the plaintiff, Gu Qiuling, to the county bureau for investigation on the 12th.</p>

<p>Stopping Gifts in Silk and Cloth Industry</p>
<p>The Jiaxing silk and cloth industry decided to hold a low-price period. On Double Ten Day, the shops greatly increased gifts to attract customers. The business of the shops on that day was three times more than usual, and several shops continued to give gifts on the 11th to attract more customers. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that the low-price gifts in the silk and cloth industry are far from the provincial regulations on prohibiting competitive sales. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Silk and Cloth Industry Association to immediately notify the shops in the industry to stop giving gifts. Therefore, the shops uniformly stopped giving gifts on the afternoon of the 11th.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Autumn Cocoon Purchase Concluded</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Control Association issued approximately 900,000 sheets of improved silkworm eggs this fall. The feeding process went very well. However, due to sudden changes in the silkworms during the spinning period, the harvest was reduced. The purchase of autumn cocoons has now been concluded, totaling about 100,000 dan. 90,000 sheets of late-autumn silkworm eggs have also been distributed, and the cocoon harvest can also be completed by the end of this month. The autumn silkworm affairs have come to an end.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Sea Fishing Season Flourishing</p>
<p>Since the large pair fishing boats in Dinghai Shenjiamen were launched in early August of the lunar calendar, they have reached three to four hundred pairs. The harvest of each wind is also quite considerable. In recent days, the average harvest of the ships docking in the port is five to six hundred catties. At the lowest price, each pair can earn thirty to forty yuan. According to the survey, the earliest fishing boats to be launched have earned six to seven hundred yuan in the past half month, while the smaller ones have also earned three to four hundred yuan. If the harvest can be maintained as such in the second half of the year, the economy of the fishing village will be easy to restore. In addition, more than a hundred large pair boats from Yindong Hubang arrived in Shenjiamen on the 8th, making the local market suddenly lively.</p>

<p>Zhejiang East Aos Restores Weighing and Releasing</p>
<p>The Zhejiang East Aos refused to accept the fixed amount of salt for a month. The Transportation Office tried its best to mediate, but because the Garrison Commissioner did not agree to the inner feelings, the matter almost changed. Later, the Transportation Office telegraphed the Left Changzhang to be responsible for the dredging, and severely ordered the Zhejiang East Aos to open the collection within a limited time to avoid triggering an incident. The Left Changzhang mediated and negotiated a compromise, and the representatives of both parties signed it. The Zhejiang East Aos also restored the weighing and releasing from the 1st, and the salt tide that had been in dispute for nine months was completely resolved. The method is: (1) The salt farmers' annual salt production per plate is 381 catties, and the Aos merchants will temporarily buy 300 catties. The remaining 81 catties will still be stored with the salt farmers, and will be weighed and released again when the sales improve. (2) The salt sold by the Aos merchants should first sell the salt received by this decision. In the future, if the sales are completed, the remaining salt stored by the Aos merchants and salt farmers will continue to be sold in half to maintain the livelihood of the salt farmers. (3) Remit 80,000 yuan to Yuyao first, and the salt farmers will be paid four corners of ocean per piece as a living maintenance fee.</p>

<h3 id="e107">City Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Requesting Correction of Customs' Discriminatory Treatment of Chinese Merchants <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, regarding the matter of the Shanghai Motor Silk Weaving Factory Association's letter of the 9th of this month, which states that its member, the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, has reported that the Jianghai Customs regulations stipulate that for all import and export customs declarations, the name of the declaring company or firm, as well as the name of the manager, must be registered with the customs in advance. This is uniformly applied to both Chinese and foreign merchants. However, for Chinese citizens, it is also necessary to submit a photograph of the manager, while foreigners are not required to submit a photograph. This is discriminatory and implies a special meaning. The Jianghai Customs is the Customs of the Republic of China, and customs administration has long been reclaimed as autonomous. However, this old habit of discriminating against Chinese people has not yet been abolished. This is not only unequal treatment but also makes people feel inferior. Therefore, we dare to request your association to forward the situation to the Ministry of Finance, the Customs Administration, and the Inspector General of Customs, requesting them to order corrections. For Chinese customs declaration registration, it should also be treated the same as foreigners, without the need to submit photographs. If it is believed that Chinese people's English signatures are not always completely identical, then either Chinese signatures or seals can be used, which should be accurate and reliable. Since the customs is the customs of China, its signatures, etc., should also be based on Chinese. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter and reply." The letter also stated that the Jianghai Customs is the Customs of the Republic of China and has long been reclaimed as autonomous. All old habits that cause inconvenience to the Chinese people and discriminate against Chinese should be renovated to promote national dignity and ensure equal treatment. According to the letter, we should respond by inquiring and requesting a forwarding. Upon arrival, the chamber found that the treatment of Chinese and foreign merchants by the customs should be uniform. It is said that when merchants register with the customs to handle customs declaration matters themselves, Chinese merchants must attach a photo of the manager, while foreign merchants do not have this procedure. Such treatment clearly distinguishes between superior and inferior, which is not only contrary to the principle of fairness in government orders but also a stain on the national dignity. It is said that this measure is due to the fact that Chinese people's English signatures are not always completely identical. Therefore, the customs' measure is inherently inappropriate, as Chinese people are not inherently familiar with English signatures, and occasional discrepancies are common. In recent years, all customs documents related to Chinese citizens have mostly been changed to Chinese. Why should we still adhere to old habits for self-declaration and force the use of English signatures? Is this not forcing the difficult and subtly creating a distinction? The rights and interests of merchants regarding the treatment of taxes on machine-made foreign goods and the registration of companies or trademarks are no different in importance compared to customs declaration registration. According to past practice, these documents are based on the manager's signature and seal, and there are no errors. How can the customs create a separate standard and impose treatment on Chinese merchants that foreign merchants do not have? It is reasonable to telegraph this to your department for review and approval, and we humbly request that you immediately order all customs offices to change the registration of Chinese merchants' customs declarations to be based on the manager's Chinese signature or seal, in order to promote national dignity and show uniformity. We are most urgently awaiting your order." The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully asks.</p>

<p>Two Ships Added to the Shanghai-Hankou Line; Fierce Competition on the Hankou-Yichang Route</p>
<p>In the downstream shipping business of the Yangtze River, besides the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Minsheng Industrial Company, which have a strong presence in transporting passengers and goods, the Japanese-owned Nissin Steamship Company also has a significant presence in the Shanghai-Hankou shipping business. Since the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, the Chinese people, driven by righteous indignation, have voluntarily converted to Chinese ships, and the business of Japanese ships has slightly declined. Recently, due to the increasing congestion of Japanese goods imports, the company's original six ships, Yueyang, Nanyang, Ruiyang, Xiangyang, Luoyang, and Fengyang, which operate on the Shanghai-Hankou route, are insufficient. Therefore, starting from the Double Tenth Festival, it has specially added the Dayuan and Daji commercial ships to the Shanghai-Hankou route to compete with Chinese state-owned and private commercial ships. On the Hankou-Changsha and Hankou-Yichang routes, Nissin also has three ships, Wuling, Yuanjiang, and Dangyang, operating back and forth, fiercely competing with the Minsheng Steamship Company.</p>

Miao and others successively met with newspaper reporters and said that their trip was of a travel nature. Xiang Hanping and five or six others would arrive on the next shift ship. They must wait for Xiang and others to arrive in Shanghai and then go to Beijing with Huang Renhuan and others who had arrived earlier to visit Chairman Chiang and other authorities to request instructions and decide on future actions. At present, the situation in Guangdong Province is progressing in everything. The peaceful resolution of the Guangdong-Guangxi issue is a blessing for the country, otherwise, both the central government and the local government will inevitably suffer losses. Although the date of Mr. Bai Jiansheng's entry into Beijing is still unknown, it is thought that after Chief of Staff Chen (Cheng) decides to go to Guilin, the result of the meeting will be that Bai will eventually enter Beijing. After Mr. Chen Bonan went abroad, he has now arrived in Switzerland for recuperation. It is not yet determined when he will return to China and enter Beijing. However, we dare to say that if the country is in trouble, any general will definitely enter Beijing and dedicate his life to the vanguard under unified command. Mayor Wu and Commander Yang will host banquets in the next few days to welcome Miao and others. Huang Renhuan, Zhang Da, and Huang Yanzhen visited Wuxi on the morning before yesterday and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon to meet with Miao and others.</p>

<h3 id="e112">A Glimpse of the Japanese Military in the Zhabei and Hongkou Areas: Ouyang Road Outpost Removed, Military Telephone Continues to Be Repaired, Exercises in Hongkou Park <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Although the Japanese marines in the Zhabei and Hongkou areas have not been completely withdrawn, the surface situation has indeed become quieter. The Japanese military outpost inside the Japanese Girls' School at the intersection of Ouyang Road and Sida Road has been removed. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency passed by there yesterday and saw only two Japanese soldiers on guard in front of the gate. Armored vehicles, military trucks, and motorcycles were all gone. According to reports, the area is a city garden, and nearby Qimei Road and other places are all peaceful. In the Jiangwan Road area, except for the Japanese troops at the Tongji Road intersection, who still send three or four guards three times a day in the name of protecting Japanese students, there is nothing unusual. However, at about 3:30 in the afternoon, two Japanese military trucks carrying 70 or 80 soldiers and two or three people who looked like senior officers in a car drove into the end of Huayuan Street one after another. At the same time, another eight trucks, all carrying more than 200 Japanese soldiers, departed from the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters in Jiangwan, turned east on North Sichuan Road, and did not know where they were going. Less than half an hour later, the empty trucks returned via Dixiwei Road. Also, when the reporter passed through the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road at about 9:00 am, he saw three Japanese soldiers repairing a military telephone there. There were also Japanese military exercises in Hongkou Park. However, according to the park guards, Japanese military exercises in the park have become commonplace and have not been interrupted for several days. The exercise time is always at 9:30 or 10:00, with as many as 500 or 600 people and as few as 200 or 300 people, all fully armed with machine guns and other weapons. The park has almost become a training ground for Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>The Japanese military outposts in various places in Hongkou, except for the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Branch Road, which have been completely removed, there were three at the Jiuxing Road Bridge and two at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Wusong Road yesterday morning, which were removed in the afternoon. There were none at the intersection of Dixiwei Road and Tiantong Road yesterday morning, but there were suddenly two in the afternoon. Furthermore, the Japanese consulate has not yet responded to our city government's protest, and the Japanese military has not completely withdrawn, so it cannot be said that there are no hidden worries.</p>

<p>Reportedly a Rotation, Totaling 150 People</p>
<p>The Japanese cruisers Nagara and Sendai No. 2 and the transport ship Izutsu, which arrived in Shanghai from Sasebo on the 11th, are still anchored on the Jiangmian of Osaka Wharf between floating docks 7 and 10. In addition to unloading a large number of burlap sacks of military supplies that night, it is understood that at 12:00 noon yesterday, another 150 marines landed from the Osaka Wharf, took five Japanese military trucks waiting there, turned into Broadway Road, turned into Wusong Road, and proceeded to the Japanese Military Headquarters on Jiangwan Road via Haining Road and North Sichuan Road. It is reported that the new soldiers were just transported from Sasebo to China for rotation. Therefore, a batch of Japanese naval marines currently stationed in Shanghai will soon be withdrawn and transferred to other ports to garrison.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Supplementary Tax and Licensing for Accumulated Rayon Fabrics for Transportation and Sale <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Factories Across the Country Must Handle This Uniformly, Ministry of Industry and Commerce Notified the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the smuggling of rayon fabrics from North China for sale in South China, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving United Association telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting that it refuse to issue licenses for the transportation and sale of rayon fabrics from North China. Now, it has received a notice from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Commercial Character No. 48756, stating: "Regarding the association's telegram requesting the rejection of the Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Industry representatives' petition to have the accumulated rayon fabrics issued transportation licenses by the customs, all of which should be taxed according to the same tax rate as South China, the Ministry believed that this matter concerned tax administration and consulted the Ministry of Finance for review and handling and made written instructions. Now, it has received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating that the methods for checking and cleaning up the factory ten goods worth of rayon were previously prescribed by the Ministry. All factories should clean up according to the regulations and report that if the rayon accumulated in the customs registration cannot provide proof of tax payment, it should be taxed according to regulations. The customs will issue a transportation license for the accumulated piece goods. Factories across the country must handle this uniformly. The Ministry previously received a telegram from the Inspector General of Customs stating that the accumulated rayon and the amount of hemp yarn stored on the machines in the Tianjin City Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association's factory had been checked and found to be consistent by the Tianjin Customs. The customs had already been instructed to pay supplementary taxes on the accumulated rayon and hemp yarn stored on the machines and issue transportation licenses for the accumulated piece goods. This is handled according to the original method. After the cleanup, the customs should check the rayon used by each factory and the piece goods woven according to regulations, which can prevent the purchase of smuggled rayon as raw materials for piece goods and maintain the business of legitimate merchants."

<h3 id="e118">Director Pan Discusses the Social Affairs Bureau's Budget Reduction: Layoffs are a Matter of Funding, No Intention to Add Appointments at City Schools or Vocational Education <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News: After the merger and reorganization of the city's Social Affairs and Education Bureaus, a portion of the original personnel was unable to continue due to the order to economize on expenses, causing misunderstandings among outsiders who were unaware of the truth. Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau gave the following speech yesterday: "After the merger and reorganization of the two bureaus, I was ordered by the municipal government to reduce the regular expenses by 10,000 yuan per month. In addition to economizing on office expenses, the scope has been reduced, and staff members will inevitably be overlooked. This is a matter of funding, not a matter of people. There are those who regret being dismissed and are unwilling to understand, and some troublemakers are taking the opportunity to distribute anonymous leaflets and openly slander. They do not know that this unavoidable measure within my responsibilities was not what I wanted. I sympathize with the dismissed staff members and have not only detailed this in the letter I sent to each dismissed staff member but have also submitted a request to the municipal government to provide appropriate compensation. If the municipal government can consider being lenient with the bureau's funding, the bureau will re-employ a portion of the personnel to provide resettlement. As for my dedication to party and government affairs over the years, I am very tired. Before the merger and reorganization of the two bureaus, I briefly planned to recuperate and repeatedly petitioned the central authorities and the mayor to resign, but I was not allowed. Therefore, I am still doing my best. However, as long as I am in office, I will be responsible for the work of the Social Affairs Bureau in the future and will strive to promote it. Personnel changes are something I have always been cautious about. I have no intention of reappointing the principals and faculty of the city's schools, and I have never even thought about it. As a party member, I ask myself to cherish and protect others. If everyone can work hard within the scope of their responsibilities, I will be busy protecting them. Why would I talk about transferring them? I hope everyone can work with peace of mind, and the facts will be the most powerful proof."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Gathering of Foreign Warships in the Huangpu River: Japanese Vessels Most Numerous, Followed by British, French, and American <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since the murder of Japanese sailor Tagang, the situation in the Far East has become tense. Consequently, various countries have mobilized their Far East fleets to protect their overseas citizens. Currently, there are a total of twenty-one foreign warships berthed in the Huangpu River, setting a new record for the number of foreign warships stationed in Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Incident occurred, the French government immediately telegraphed General Esteva, commander of the French Far East Fleet stationed in Weihaiwei, to dispatch warships to Shanghai. Upon receiving the order, General Esteva personally boarded the flagship "La Motte-Picquet" and led the gunboats "Tahr" and "Admiral Rénouart," arriving in Shanghai from Weihai on the 6th. They are all berthed on the Huangpu River off the French Concession Bund and at the naval pontoon, totaling four ships including the previously stationed "General Amiral Charner" gunboat.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>The United States Far East Fleet was originally stationed in the South Seas area. After receiving news of the Shanghai Incident, Admiral Maben, commander of the Far East Fleet, sailed on the flagship "Augusta," leading the gunboat "Asheville" and the "Trenton" cruiser, arriving in Shanghai on the 1st of this month. Including the cruiser "Milwaukee," which arrived last month, there are a total of four warships stationed.</p>
<p>Great Britain</p>
<p>In addition to the existing British warship "Peterel" stationed in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Leatham, commander of the British China Fleet, dispatched the destroyer "Grafton" to Shanghai and personally came to Shanghai on the flagship "Kent" for inspection. Now that the situation in Shanghai has returned to normal, it is scheduled to sail south within days. As for the two Italian warships originally stationed in Shanghai to protect their citizens, now that the situation in Shanghai has gradually eased, except for the gunboat "Lepanto" stationed in Shanghai, the other gunboat "Ermanno Carlotto" has already gone to Hankou.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Oikawa, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, is usually stationed in Shanghai. Therefore, there are more Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai than those of other countries. However, since the Tagang murder case, in addition to sending naval landing forces for defense, warships stationed in various locations have also been ordered to come to Shanghai to provide support. However, they mainly transported landing forces and ammunition, so they returned immediately after arriving in Shanghai. A total of two ships have made round trips. Currently in Shanghai are four ships: the flagship Izumo, the cruiser Tatsuta, the destroyer Satsuki, the destroyers Nagatsuki and Minazuki, five torpedo boats, a transport ship, and one gunboat.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Situation Eases, River Cargo Crowded for Loading: Hunan Water Shallow, Navigation Route Cut Off, Freight Rates Soar by 60% <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, Shanghai's Yangtze River shipping companies temporarily suspended loading of all cargo destined for Jiujiang, Hankou, and Hunan Province due to the serious situation. Goods were stockpiled in Shanghai warehouses. Moreover, due to shallow water in Hunan, transportation was difficult, causing warehouses to be even more crowded. Now that the situation has gradually eased, the Yangtze River shipping companies are taking advantage of this opportunity to rush to load and export the previously stockpiled goods, starting yesterday. Cotton yarn, cloth, white sugar, salt, and daily necessities are the main commodities. They are being reported to China Merchants, Sanbei, NingShao, Taikoo, and Jardine Matheson companies for transportation to Xun and Han ports. Yesterday, the Jianghua ship loaded more than 30,000 dan of cargo. Other Yangtze River transport ships were also fully loaded, and even more could not be cleared through customs in time for loading, which will be continued today and tomorrow. In total, the accumulated goods to be transported to the Yangtze River are worth at least 7 million yuan. Sanbei Company has specially added the Xingshi transport ship, and the China Merchants Bureau also plans to add two ships to operate, because there is still a huge amount of cargo waiting to be transported. The Xiang River is shallow, has receded to 3.2 feet, and the navigation route is blocked, only reaching Dulin Tan. Shanghai's outgoing cargo is also crowded, and the six companies, in order to maintain Hunan's transportation and avoid interruption, have hired a large number of civilian boats at Lulin Tan to transship goods. The shallow water fee for Changsha has already increased by 10%, and it has been decided to increase it by another 40%. The shallow water fee from Shanghai to Changde will increase by 60%.</p>

In addition, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, have been designated by the National Government as representatives to preside over the ceremony. Therefore, they will also travel to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou on the same ship as Wang. As for Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, who originally planned to go together to participate and inspect the financial situation of Guangdong Province, it is difficult to predict whether he will be able to make the trip due to the numerous important affairs in Nanjing and Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Speech by Wang Yongbin, Minister of Judicial Administration <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yongbin, Minister of Judicial Administration, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at around 6:00 am on the 9th of this month. He first inspected the Second Prison directly under the Ministry and broadcast a speech to the prisoners. Then he went to the Zhenru Forensic Medical Research Institute to preside over the graduation ceremony of the researchers and examiners of the Institute and delivered a speech. All the chief officials of the Shanghai courts attended, and the ceremony was very grand. After the ceremony, he returned to Nanjing in the afternoon of the same day. The main points of Minister Wang's speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Speech at the Zhenru Forensic Medical Research Institute: The general idea is that today is the graduation ceremony of the researchers and examiners of the Forensic Medical Research Institute. I, as the Minister, deeply believe that the training of forensic medical researchers is still a pioneering undertaking in the judicial circles of our country, and the responsibilities that you will bear in the future are extremely important. Now that you are graduating, I have come to Shanghai from Nanjing to preside over the ceremony. Criminal trials are valued in discovering the truth. In the past era of torture and confession, all criminal facts were based on the confessions of criminals, and the facts of forced confessions were everywhere. The so-called "under the three woods, what cannot be obtained?" The construction of unjust cases was by no means accidental. Since the reform, the system of torture has been absolutely rejected, and the discovery of criminal facts depends entirely on evidence. Therefore, Article 270, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law states that even if the defendant has confessed, other necessary evidence should still be investigated to see if it is consistent with the facts. It is very clear that the position of confession in today's trial is almost irrelevant. However, the nature of evidence depends on the evolution of social conditions, the progress of science, and the ever-changing methods of crime. Whether most of the evidence is reliable cannot be identified by experts. Although the power of collecting evidence rests with the judge, the identification of the authenticity of most evidence and the examination of deaths and injuries are the responsibility of you. Therefore, the responsibilities that you will bear in the future cannot be said to be not important. I, as the Minister, have deep and urgent expectations for you. Since the implementation of the Court Organization Law, the number of courts at all levels has increased sharply, and the need for forensic doctors is increasingly felt. However, limited by funds and time, it has not been possible to train a large number of talents in a short period of time to meet the needs of the courts in various provinces. However, I, as the Minister, am planning to enrich the Forensic Medical Research Institute and continue to train a large number of forensic medical personnel. Since you are pioneers, I firmly believe that you will be able to base your knowledge and fulfill your duties to be the model for those who come later.</p>
<p>(2) Broadcasting Speech at the Second Prison directly under the Ministry of Justice: The general idea is that I, as the Minister, have come to Shanghai due to official business, and in the midst of my busy schedule, I have come to inspect this prison. I have seen that the residences, food, and clothing of the prisoners are all clean and hygienic, and the prisoners are working diligently, which is very satisfactory. However, the country has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to build this huge prison. Its purpose is not for the comfort of you prisoners, but to emphasize education as the purpose of modern punishment. You have violated the national criminal punishment regulations and have been sentenced by the court and transferred here to be executed. It is like sending a sick person to a hospital for treatment. In the future, when you are released from prison or have credible repentance, you will be granted parole according to the law, just like a patient who has recovered from illness and left the hospital. Therefore, you should, during the execution of your sentence, inspire your conscience, wash away your past mistakes, abide by prison rules, and accept teachings, so that you can become good citizens in the future, and how you should especially strive to work diligently to acquire a skill to make a living after being released from prison. You must know that the more evil people there are in the country, the more the country loses its vitality. The more good people there are in the country, the more the country increases its vitality. Although there are various reasons for your crimes in the past, the lack of a correct outlook on life is one of them. This prison is directly under the Ministry, and all teaching and work are more complete. I, as the Minister, deeply hope that after you leave this prison in the future, you will surely become good citizens and increase the country's vitality. This is what I expect.</p>

<p>The Shangsong Automobile Company was founded by Niu Tiesheng and Yin Shisheng. The company has been established for five years and is convenient for passengers. Now the company has also built a new Songsi Road, which has also been opened to traffic. The original plan was to reach Shanghai directly from Sijing and Qibao, so the distance between Songjiang and Shanghai would be shortened by one-third compared to the current route, and it would take less than an hour to reach each other. However, the Jiufeng and Sanmao of Songjiang are known to everyone, and the Jiufeng is best known for Yushan. Therefore, the company has specially opened the Zhuanyu route, so that people in Shanghai who want to visit Yushan can reach it by one car. The road was completed the day before yesterday, so the company's manager Yin Shisheng invited Shanghai news reporters and general friends to Yushan on Double Ten Day to visit. On that day, there were no less than a hundred news reporters and friends from Shanghai, which can be said to be a great event.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Huang Fu, who is ill in the Henry Lester Institute Hospital, has made progress in terms of diet and spirit since inviting General Fan Shisheng to treat him. He is still continuing to take the medicine prescribed by Fan, and it is reported that Fan will come to Shanghai within days to re-examine Huang. President Chiang Kai-shek flew from Nanjing to Hangzhou on the 10th and stayed in Shanghai for a short time, making a special trip to visit Huang's illness. President Chiang Kai-shek talked with Huang in the Henry Lester Institute Hospital for more than an hour, which is enough to prove that Huang's condition has made good progress.</p>

<p>At around 10:40 yesterday morning, at the intersection of Fujian Road and Ningbo Road, a middle-aged man was passing by when two robbers who had been lying in ambush suddenly jumped out to rob him. One robber held a bag of lime, and the other held a gun. The robber with the bag threw the lime bag at the man's face, causing him to be unable to open his eyes. The robbers took the opportunity to search the man's body, stealing more than 1,800 yuan that he had hidden and fleeing without a trace. The man was blinded and unable to follow. He frantically shouted for help. By the time the nearby policemen heard the alarm and arrived, it was too late. They immediately reported to the police station and sent a car to rush him to the hospital for treatment. They also sent detectives to pursue the robbers. It was learned that the man's name was Pan Bokang, a Ningbo native, 33 years old, a wood box business, with a shop at No. 40 Xiamen Road. The stolen money was all from collecting accounts from various places.</p>

<p>Police Have Filed a Lawsuit, Charge of Endangering Public Safety</p>
<p>Police detectives Kong Guangxiao and Zhang Peilan of the Chengdu Road Police Station saw two people coming towards them near Longdou Road and Edinburgh Road at 3:30 yesterday morning. Their appearance was suspicious, so they stepped forward to arrest them. They found a handgun and six bullets on one of the men. They brought the men to the police station and questioned them. They learned that the two men were named Zhang Heshang, a Chongming native (the one carrying the gun), and Lu Ziqing, a Haimen native. According to Zhang, a man named Huang Fugen had an affair with his wife, so he had a grudge. Last night, he learned that Huang was playing in the Great World, so he carried a gun and bullets and invited Lu Ziqing to go and cause trouble. Unexpectedly, they searched everywhere for Huang Fugen but could not find him, so they walked out of the Great World and were arrested. They were ordered to be detained. At around 9:00, they were escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 187 of the Criminal Law, endangering public safety, and stated the case, saying that whether the statements made by the defendants in the police station were true or not has not been investigated and should be extended. Judge Zhuan Lin briefly questioned Zhang Heshang and Lu Ziqing and ordered them to be detained for rescheduling the hearing on the 16th.</p>

<p>2,000 Dollars in Cash Stolen, Robber Gang Has Handguns</p>
<p>According to a local report from the Foreign News Agency, a robbery occurred in the downtown area of the Special District in broad daylight, and 2,000 yuan in cash was stolen. The Central Police Department is paying close attention to this. The case occurred at 1:40 p.m. yesterday at the Binqing Money Exchange at No. 584 Sichuan Road, located opposite the YMCA. According to the store staff, there were five robbers, each carrying a firearm. They rushed into the store, monitored the store staff, forced them to hand over 2,000 yuan in cash, and then fled together. The store staff did not panic or make any noise, so the robbers did not fire a shot and fled calmly, without alarming nearby neighbors. All five robbers were wearing black long gowns, black woolen hats, and carried small black handguns. They spoke Shanghainese and northern Jiangsu dialects. They have not been caught yet.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Case of Japanese Sailor Nakayama Hideo: Zhou Sherong Released; Yang Wendao's Appeal Filed with the Court Yesterday Morning <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong, all from Guangdong, were prosecuted by the Public Concession Police for the shooting death of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Doule'an Road on November 9th of last year. The Special Court No. 1 has already tried the case, sentencing Yang and Ye to death and acquitting Zhou. Following the verdict, Yang and Ye separately filed appeals with the High Court's Second Branch. As for Zhou Sherong, the police have confirmed that they will not appeal further. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, declared to Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Division of Special Court No. 1, that they were abandoning the appeal against Zhou and requested his immediate release. Judge Qian ordered Zhou Sherong's release. Ye Haisheng's appeal has already been recorded in this newspaper. Yang Wendao's wife, Mrs. Tang, commissioned lawyer Tang Huaiqun to draft an appeal on behalf of her husband, Yang Wendao, which was also submitted to the High Court's Second Branch yesterday morning, requesting that the original judgment be overturned and Yang Wendao be declared innocent. The original statement is as follows:</p>
<p>Appellant: Yang Wendao, Case No. 893 of the 24th Year of the Republic, the Public Works Bureau's Disraeli Road Police Station versus Yang Wendao for conspiring to murder Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo. Dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, he hereby submits an appeal and supplementary reasons. Upon review of the first instance judgment by the First Special District Court, Yang Wendao was convicted of murdering Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo and sentenced to death. An appeal has been duly filed within the prescribed time limit. After studying the contents of the judgment, the grounds on which Yang Wendao's guilt and sentence were based are twofold: (1) a physics book with a gun-shaped hole, and (2) Ye Haisheng's confession. However, whether these two points can serve as the basis for a conviction, considering the circumstances of the previous court hearings and corroborating evidence, constitutes a grave injustice that requires separate explanation and presentation.</p>
<p>Regarding the Book with a Gun-Shaped Hole</p>
<p>After Yang Wendao was arrested, although he admitted in court on April 20th that the physics book with a gun-shaped hole presented by the police belonged to him, he stated on April 27th that the book was not his and that he had previously owned another one. The former was a frank admission without any hesitation, while the latter was a sudden change of heart. Those who do not pay attention to the facts might suspect him of being cunning and firmly believe that the book is ironclad evidence of guilt. However, after examining both past and present circumstances, the truth will become clear without detailed explanation. (Yang Wendao borrowed a pistol from his friend Li Mu in the 22nd year of the Republic and registered it with the Public Works Bureau for self-defense. However, fearing that his many children might play with it and cause an accident, he asked his cousin Yang Jianzhong for a method of hiding it by cutting a hole in a book. He immediately used an English physics book to create a hiding place. Later, the gun was returned, and the book became useless and was discarded, left for his children to play with. The day after his arrest, the police found the book in his house and took it back to the police station. Although they did not ask, Yang Wendao immediately said that the book belonged to him (according to Deputy Inspector Crowe's report)). It is clear that Yang Wendao did not consider this book to be of any importance, and his confession in court on April 20th shows his frankness. If the book were indeed part of a criminal act, there would be no reason to keep it at home for a long time, nor would he be foolish enough to directly admit ownership. Therefore, the origin of the book must be investigated. Thus, Yang Wendao's admission to the book, and his later claim that it was planted by his cousin Yang Jianzhong, warrant further investigation. It is alleged that Yang Jianzhong is of bad character, fierce by nature, and known to his fellow villagers and friends. If a secret investigation is conducted, it will not be difficult to find out that several days before Yang Wendao's arrest, his clan member Yang Guimei told him that he was suspected of something and should flee quickly. When Yang Wendao asked about the source of this information, he said it was relayed by Yang Jianzhong. When Yang Wendao eagerly wanted to bring him to meet Yang Jianzhong, he hesitated and could not answer, and was often slapped in the face by Yang Wendao in anger. This happened before, so Yang Jianzhong is likely to have premeditated this case. In addition, the testimony of witness Zhang Chen and the interconnectedness of witnesses Hui Yuan and Zheng Pingshan presented by the police (as detailed in the appeal by lawyer Zhang Zhizhang on behalf of Ye Haisheng) suggest that Yang Jianzhong's framing is not without cause. However, the fingerprints and palm prints taken from Yang Jianzhong and submitted to the Forensic Institute for examination, after detailed comparison, did not reveal any similar patterns to the fingerprints left in the book. Therefore, the claim that Yang Jianzhong framed him is considered unsupportable. Generally, if someone is planting evidence, does the evidence necessarily have to have their fingerprints and palm prints to prove it? We will set that aside for now. However, since the book had been kept in Yang Wendao's house for a long time, why is it that the fingerprints and palm prints of Yang Wendao, examined repeatedly by the Forensic Institute at the request of the original court and compared with the fingerprints found in the book, did not reveal any similarities, and the bloody fingerprints in the book did not match Yang Wendao's fingerprints and palm prints? (All seen in the Institute's various examination reports). Is there any reason for this? The original court ignored this important issue. Not only is the determination of facts clearly wrong, but the judgment that the book does not have Yang Jianzhong's fingerprints is also unfair. Furthermore, according to the internal reports of the Forensic Institute, if the dirt and pressure marks on each page are as deep as they appear, why are the cut marks in the hole, which must have been used for a long time, still so neat and new? This is impossible, as everyone knows. The original court did not pay attention to this, which is puzzling. If this book with the gun-shaped hole presented in evidence is immediately used as evidence to convict Yang Wendao, it is unreasonable and inconceivable.</p>
<p>Regarding Ye Haisheng's Confession</p>
<p>Ye Haisheng's confession, as seen in the court transcripts, is contradictory and insincere (as detailed in the appeal by lawyer Zhang Zhizhang). Therefore, the sections involving Yang Wendao are not credible. Furthermore, Yang Wendao has never admitted the facts of the conspiracy to murder as stated by Ye Haisheng. Ye also stated that a Korean, Jack, participated in the conspiracy. However, when questioned in court, Jack and Yang Wendao did not know each other. If it were indeed a premeditated joint murder, this important matter could not be entrusted to someone unknown. Therefore, given the complexity and darkness of the case's inside story, how can Ye Haisheng's confession, involving Yang Wendao, be considered the basis for a conviction? It goes without saying that this is a miscarriage of justice. The original court completely ignored evidence favorable to the defendant, which is truly regrettable. In light of the above facts and reasons, it is clear that the occurrence of this case is entirely due to a conspiracy by false witnesses Zheng Pingshan, Zeng Yuan, Zhang Zhi, Yang Jianzhong, and others to frame him. The death of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo has nothing to do with the defendant Yang Wendao. Apart from the reasons for defense in this case, which have already been detailed in the appeal by lawyer Zhang Zhizhang on behalf of the second defendant, Ye Haisheng, and will not be repeated, we hereby submit to your honor, hoping that you will be gracious and grant a secret investigation, revoke the original judgment, and declare Yang Wendao innocent and release him, thereby redressing the miscarriage of justice, bringing the dead back to life and returning flesh to bones, which would be a true act of kindness. Respectfully submitted, [to] the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch. [Submitted by] Yang Wendao's wife, Yang Tangshi; [Drafted by] Lawyer Tang Huaiqun.</p>

<p>Liu Xianfa (also known as Liu Yun), a local resident, already had a wife, but on the 4th of this month, he married Shen Huizhen (father's name Huizhen), a former nurse, at the Weiya Restaurant on Fourth Road, and opened room 131 at the Yangtze Hotel as a wedding chamber. His wife, Chen Lindi, found out and reported it to the Old Zhabei Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Liu and Shen. They were handed over to the First Special Court, which ordered them to settle the matter out of court. Liu and Shen were each granted bail of 200 yuan. These details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Liu has now reached a settlement with Chen. After further questioning by Judge Qian yesterday morning, Liu and Shen were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years. The bail taken during the appeal period remains valid.</p>

<p>Wu Liu Dies; Police Sue Driver</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, at 4:15 PM, in front of the British-owned Public Omnibus Company on Connaught Road, a car with license plate number 8284, driven by Cai Guomin, was towing a newly repaired car with Chinese license plate number 5651 (driven by Chen Guixing, a coppersmith from the Gordon Road Repair Shop) in an easterly direction. At that time, a handcart pushed by Gong A'er from Chongming, with a carpenter named Gu Maomao sitting on it, and a piece of lumber eighteen feet long, along with other planks, was also moving forward in the same direction. Cai wanted to pass the handcart, so he turned the wheel to the right. However, Chen, who was not skilled in driving, did not turn the wheel, causing him to crash into the lumber. As a result, the cart and people fell to the ground, and a woman from Yancheng, Wu Liu, and her two children were also injured. In total, there were five injured men, women, and children. However, because Wu Liu's injuries were the most severe, she was sent to Guangren Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and she died at 4:30 AM on the 10th. The body was taken to the forensic examination center on Faelun Road. The others were sent to the hospital. After being bandaged, they had already left the hospital for treatment. The Gordon Road Police Station, after investigation, determined that Chen Guixing was suspected of negligent homicide and arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the First Special Court for prosecution. Because further investigation was needed, the police requested an extension. Later, Zhang Qiru, a prosecutor from the court's Procuratorate, arrived at the forensic examination center. The examination revealed that the deceased, Wu Liu, female, was struck by a car and lumber, resulting in her death. The body was handed over to her husband, Wu Changzhu, for burial. Chen Guixing, the perpetrator, has been prosecuted by the police and handed over to the court for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Pan Bosheng, a local resident, 31 years old, who lives downstairs at the south end of Caohejing Town, Shanghai West, and grows flowers, took a rickshaw yesterday at around 2 AM, carrying fresh flowers to Shanghai for sale. When he arrived at the south end of Caoxi Road and Zhongshan Road, near the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, a bandit suddenly jumped out of the darkness and blocked Pan's path. Pan Bosheng, knowing they were up to no good, shouted for help. The bandit pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed Pan's right leg and right arm four times, causing him to fall to the ground. A patrolman heard the sound and rushed over, but the bandit had already fled far away. Pan Bosheng was escorted home and was treated at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road yesterday.</p>

<p>Zhang Wanyi, a man from Sichuan, 70 years old, established the Zhang Wanyi firm at No. 1 Taideli, West Zigaihuo Street. On January 31st of last year, Zhang used a warehouse receipt from the Donglai Bank to pledge goods at the Zhicheng Money Shop at No. x, Jiyang Lane, Henan Road. The receipt stated that there were forty boxes of goods, but did not specify the detailed contents of the boxes. Zhang further wrote a receipt stating that the boxes contained 1255 dozen men's and women's undershirts, worth a total of 18,212 yuan. After negotiation, a pledge of 12,000 yuan was made for a term of three months. After the pledge agreement was made, Zhang first paid back 2,000 yuan to the Zhicheng Money Shop on April 1st, and then paid interest of 120 yuan in May. After that, there was no news. Although Zhicheng Money Shop repeatedly urged him to redeem the goods, Zhang tried to delay. Recently, because Zhang had no intention of redeeming the goods, Zhicheng Money Shop exercised its right of mortgage and inspected the boxes at the Donglai Bank warehouse at No. 881 Suzhou Road. It was found that the forty boxes contained only 380 dozen undershirts, which was more than two-thirds less than the number Zhang stated on the receipt. However, the warehouse facilities were in good condition, and there was no possibility of theft. It was clear that Zhang had committed fraud. The manager of the shop, Qin Zhenfu, hired lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan to report the matter to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Yang Peisheng and detective Kang Zengxiang went to No. 1 Hede Road and arrested Zhang, and entrusted the second landlord of the house, Hu Yunfei, to take care of the items Zhang left behind. Zhang was taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the facts and prosecuted him for fraud under Article 349 of the Criminal Law. He stated that Zhang Wanyi had confessed to the crime at the police station. However, he claimed that the matter was not his master plan, but was instigated by Sheng Mengli (residing at No. 17 Gaofu Lane, Pushi Road, French Concession), the deputy manager of Zhicheng Money Shop, and the second landlord, Hu Yunfei. Therefore, the police are currently investigating and requested that the court postpone the case. After Judge Pan Zhenyang interrogated Zhang, he ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e141">The Tongyi Bank Shareholders' Meeting Resolved to Dissolve Immediately <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yongzuo Appointed as Liquidator</p>
<p>After the Tongyi Bank suspended operations in January of last year, it entrusted accountant Xu Yongzuo to investigate the accounts, collect debts, and settle debts. Shareholders' meetings were convened twice last year to discuss plans for progress, but both times the number of shareholders present was insufficient to meet the legal requirements, and no decision could be made. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, another extraordinary shareholders' meeting was held at the Xu Accountant Firm on Avenue Edward VII. The number of attendees met the legal requirements. Yu Huanzheng was elected as chairman. The chairman first asked accountant Xu to report on the progress. He briefly stated that the bank's external debt at the time of the suspension of operations was as high as 3.2 to 3.3 million yuan. It has been gradually settled since then, and only about 700,000 yuan remains outstanding. The chairman asked the attendees to discuss plans for progress. It was generally agreed that the current situation and market conditions are worse than at the time of the suspension, and there is no certainty of resumption of operations. With only 700,000 yuan of external debt remaining, it would be better to dissolve and liquidate immediately to bring the matter to an end. This was unanimously approved on the spot, and accountant Xu Yongzuo was elected as liquidator with full authority to handle liquidation matters.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Tragic Murder with Barber Scissors of an Adulterous Man; Zhang Meiyun Collaborates with His Wife's Younger Brother; Turns Vicious Against His Wife's Lover <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Meiyun, also known as Xiao Shuangzi, a barber from Yangzhou, in his twenties, lived at No. 4 Yuedeli, Dongchang Road, Pudong. His wife, Feng Lanying, 23 years old, worked at the Lunchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Lujiazui. Despite her ordinary appearance, she was coveted and seduced by Zhang Liuchen (24 years old) from Shandong, who rowed boats at the Xiaonanyang Wharf near the factory, resulting in an affair. In May of this year, because of a lack of secrecy, the husband discovered the affair, arrested the adulterous couple, and handed them over to the Pudong Branch Bureau, which transferred them to the local court. As a result, the two sides reached a settlement. Unexpectedly, Zhang Liuchen and Feng Lanying still maintained contact, secretly meeting from time to time. Feng's younger brother, Baoguo, also a barber, felt that his sister's behavior was a disgrace to his family, so he conspired with his brother-in-law, Meiyun. At about 9 PM the night before last, they took a pair of barber scissors, disassembled them into two halves, each holding one half, went to Lujiazui, and called out Liuchen, pretending to go to Jiang Wencai's house at No. 2 Yangzhou Lane, Dongchang Road, to discuss the matter. When they reached Jiang's door, Feng Sanyi suddenly raised half a pair of scissors and stabbed Liuchen three times. He was stabbed once in the left waist, once in the inner side of the left thigh, and once in the inner side of the right thigh. The abdominal wound was the most severe, with organs flowing out. He fell to the ground, unconscious. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the murderers, led by Meiyun, went to the Lunchang Factory to call out Lanying, and the three fled in different directions without a trace. The injured man was rushed to Pudong Hospital by witnesses Jiang Wencai and Zhao A'er, but he died before arriving. The body was taken to the hospital morgue to await examination. After the incident, Wang Shifu, the captain of the Pudong Detective Branch, ordered team leaders Chen Jinshan and Cheng Peizhang, and detectives Chang Zhao Bingquan, Li Shuren, and Cui Youkuan, to arrest the murderers separately. Yesterday morning at 2 AM, a suspicious woman named Guo Zhaodi was found at the Dongchang Road ferry. She stated that she lived in the city at Guangqi Road, Sipailou, and had known Feng Lanying before. She said, "Lanying came to my house to live, and ordered me to go to her house in Pudong to get clothes. I didn't expect to be arrested." The detectives got this lead and rushed to Pudong to arrest Lanying, who confessed that her husband was waiting in front of the Qingquan Bathhouse on Avenue Edward VII. The detectives rushed to the Qingquan Bathhouse, waiting until dawn, but there was no sign of him. As the clock struck five, they returned to the Dongmen Road Pier at the Sixteenth Bund and suddenly encountered the murderer Feng Baoguo guarding the ferry. Seeing the detectives and his sister arrive, he knew he had been exposed and tried to flee, but was caught by the detectives. Along with the team, after Zhang Jinlin, the coroner of the Pudong Branch Bureau, and witnesses Jiang Wencai and Zhao A'er interrogated the suspects, they were ordered to be sent to the General Bureau for questioning in the evening. At the same time, the search for the fugitive Zhang Meiyun was continued for further investigation. As for the body of the deceased, the bureau ordered the local guarantor Lu Shunlong to report to the local court. At 4 PM, prosecutor Kong was appointed to go to Pudong to examine the body. The examination revealed that the deceased had been stabbed in a vital area and died. The body was ordered to be prepared for burial by the family, pending further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Qianjiatang: Bloodshed Occurred Last Night; The Deceased Was Yin Bengen, Formerly a Detective <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Last night (the 11th) at 11:00 PM, two men, one wearing a long black robe and the other wearing a white-grey shirt and trousers, were seen in the French Concession's Qianjiatang chasing a man in black shirt and trousers from west to east.  The chase ended at the entrance of No. 168 Wujia Lane, in front of the house of a local woman named Shao Wang.  The fleeing man, seeing that the gate of Shao Wang's house was not closed, was about to squat down and escape inside when the man in black clothes caught up and grabbed him.  The man in white-grey shirt and trousers immediately drew a gun and fired several shots. The man in black shirt and trousers was hit by three bullets in the right side of his head, the back of his head, and under his ear.  Blood gushed out like a tide.  Seeing his objective achieved, the assailant turned and fled.  Shao Wang, who was about to close her door to go to sleep, was shocked and dared not speak.  After the assailant had gone far and she regained her composure, she reported the incident to the French police. Detectives were dispatched to investigate, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy room.  The detectives found a letter on the deceased, which read "Yin Bengen" and his address.  They investigated the address and learned that the deceased was indeed Yin Bengen, currently 39 years old, from Hefei. He had previously worked as a gatekeeper and patrolman and was now unemployed. His wife, Yin Chen, worked as a servant at No. 10, 741 Julu Road in the company's building. The deceased lived with his wife. His wife was notified and arrived at the scene.  Yesterday morning, Judge Wang, an inspector of the Second Special Court, along with a forensic doctor and a clerk, arrived at the hall and confirmed that the deceased had died from gunshot wounds.  According to witness Shao Wang's testimony, she described the circumstances of the deceased's shooting.  The deceased's wife, Yin Chen, stated that her husband had mentioned an enemy with the surname Yang, but she did not know the address. She currently had no means to claim the body. The official instructed that the body be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan for burial. The police department will handle the arrest of the perpetrator. It is reported that the deceased had previously served as a detective and had solved several theft cases. It is suspected that his murder is related to a grudge held by criminals from previous theft cases he solved.</p>

<p>One Thief Apprehended</p>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, at No. 22 Yongren Lane, Xujiahui Road, in the French Concession, Ou Fusheng (35 years old), a native of Taicang, who runs the Yichang Enamelware Shop, was suddenly attacked by seven or eight robbers. Two thieves acted as lookouts, while the rest broke in, threatening with guns, and tied up the shop assistants with ropes. They imprisoned them in a room, silencing any sound. As a result, they robbed the shop of its entire day's earnings.  As the thieves were leaving with their loot, scattering in different directions, the owner, Ou Fusheng, happened to return from outside. He noticed the thieves and knew something was wrong. The shop's accountant, Zhang Huren, had also managed to loosen his bonds and chased after them, informing the owner about the robbery.  Ou Fusheng immediately pursued the lead thief, shouting "Catch the thief!"  At the intersection of Huajie Manufacturing Bureau Road and Xie Xu Road, Mo Ruomin (25 years old, Jiangsu native), a manure cart inspector from the Shanghai South Agricultural Transport, was on his way to visit relatives in the Hengqing Lane on Baylor Road. He heard the thief alarm and someone shouting, so he bravely stepped forward, joining police officer Wang Tongjie from the Tangjiawan Police Station, Post 19, in the chase. The thief drew a gun, attempting to shoot and resist arrest, but the gun jammed. He was then apprehended.  A four-inch white-handled Browning pistol with six bullets was found on him. He identified himself as Zhang Xiaodi, 25 years old. He was taken to the police station for interrogation, and the police are rigorously pursuing his accomplices who are still at large.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The County Magistrate Doused with Caustic Soda Case: Important Evidence Discovered; Fang Aliu Testifies Vividly; Four Letters Provide Reference for the Case <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xueseng, a native of Songjiang, over forty years old, formerly served as the County Magistrate of Zhangye in Gansu. He has resided in Shanghai for many years. On the evening of March 6 of this year, near Wangzhi Road in the French Concession, he was injured in the face by an assailant using corrosive liquid. The assailant, Gao Jinsheng, was riding a bicycle and attempted to flee in a panic during the attack. However, the bicycle suddenly fell, causing Gao to fall off the bicycle and also be splashed by the caustic soda, resulting in his immediate arrest.  After trial by the Second Special District Court, he was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. Gao appealed, but his appeal was rejected. He is currently within the period for final appeal. Details have been reported in this newspaper previously. Since the incident, the victim, Xu Xueseng, has undergone a long period of treatment and has been fortunate to recover, but a large portion of his face has been destroyed, and his right eye is completely blind. It was later discovered that Zhu Guanghan, a fellow townsman currently residing at No. 4 Fuyangfang, Tongfu Road, in the Public Concession, and Chen Axi, the son of Zhu's old servant Chen Meilang, were suspected of instigating the assault. A lawyer was retained to file a complaint against Zhu and Chen at the Shanghai Local Court. Efforts were made to apprehend Chen Axi in the countryside of Wuxian County. He was arrested, brought to court, and interrogated.  After several hearings, another hearing was held yesterday at 2:00 PM. Judge Yu Lude presided over the third criminal court. The lawyers for the plaintiff, Xu Xueseng, were Xu Lin and Wen Chao. The lawyers for the defendant, Zhu Guanghan, were Gu Changyuan, He Xianzhang, and Ding Zheming.  First, the witness Jiang Weicheng was called to testify. Jiang stated that he was 49 years old, a native of Wuxian County, Jiangsu, residing at No. 486 Qipu Road. He was formerly a detective with the Public Concession Police Station and resigned two years ago. He currently runs a rice shop. He has no family relationship with either Xu or Zhu. Around the end of the lunar year last year, a friend surnamed Feng, whom he knew, came to his (Jiang's) house, saying that the sister of a woman named Fan Qian, who was married as a concubine to Zhu Guanghan, a merchant from Songjiang, was in a state of life and death unknown. Feng wanted to find and introduce a lawyer Zheng Wen to represent her in suing Zhu Guanghan and seeking 7,000 yuan in compensation through an incidental private suit. Feng knew that lawyer Zheng Wen's firm shared the same residence with him and that Zheng and he were good friends. He introduced Feng and Fan Qian to lawyer Zheng. After three negotiations, a settlement was reached, with Qian being compensated 1,000 yuan. One evening around 8:00 PM, Xu Xueseng suddenly arrived, saying that Zhu Guanghan had instructed him to come and that the settlement draft should be based on Zhu's own draft, not lawyer Zheng's. No one objected, and the settlement was completed. Zheng Wen and he acted as witnesses. This was the initial course of events. However, one morning in February of this year, Feng suddenly called him, asking if he knew that Xu Xueseng had been doused with caustic soda and told him to read the newspaper immediately. He bought a copy of the "Shishi Xinbao" and found out what had happened. Feng also arrived at the same time, claiming that if this matter were to escalate, they would trace it back to the settlement at the end of last year and that they might both be suspected. It would be best for them to step forward and fundamentally resolve the matter. However, lawyer Zheng's response was that Xu's injuries were too severe at this time and that they could not proceed until Xu's injuries had healed. When Xu's injuries showed slight improvement, they resumed negotiations. At that time, Xu demanded that Zhu Guanghan provide him with a living allowance of 500 yuan per month for fifteen years, totaling over 90,000 yuan. Feng claimed that Zhu did not have such financial resources. After repeated negotiations, Zhu was willing to pay Xu 10,000 yuan to settle the matter, and Xu agreed. Feng said that Zhu had returned to Songjiang to raise the money and would return to Shanghai by Tuesday or Wednesday. Unexpectedly, after waiting for three days, Feng called him again, saying that Zhu had only raised 2,000 yuan and that he intended to pay the rest with checks. This was too far off the mark, and there were various inconveniences with checks. He was really unable to get involved and could only declare his withdrawal. At this time, Zhu Guanghan was right next to the phone, waiting for a reply, but he absolutely refused to participate.  At this point, Feng withdrew from all involvement. However, several days later, a man named Zhu Mengwei, a member of Xu Xueseng's clan, also intended to mediate, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. This was the true account of what he had experienced. At this point, lawyer Xu Lin stood up and stated that during the court recess, the plaintiff, Xu Xueseng, had obtained from Fang Aliu, a friend of Gao Jinsheng, the assailant who was in custody, four letters and notes sent by Gao Jinsheng from prison. The letters detailed how he instructed Chen Axi's father, Chen Meilang, to contact Zhu Guanghan quickly, how lawyer Gu Changyuan went to see him, how lawyer Gu promised him a reward, and how he instructed his aunt to go to the firm to collect money. He requested that the judge examine them in detail. He then presented the letters to the court. Finally, lawyer Xu stated that the witness Fang Aliu was now in court and requested that he be examined. Judge Yu ordered Fang to be brought before the court. Fang stated that he was 27 years old, a native of Cixi, Zhejiang, residing on Ximen Road in the French Concession. He had previously been in the beef business and was now unemployed. He further stated that Gao Jinsheng was a close friend of his. He had been sentenced to imprisonment by the First Special District Court for smoking opium and was released on January 23 of this year. After his release, he learned that Gao Jinsheng had been blinded by greed and used by others to attack someone with caustic soda and had been arrested and sentenced to four years. He had visited him once, but Gao still maintained his mindset of taking other people's money to solve other people's problems and refused to reveal the instigators. During a certain hearing, he (Fang) witnessed Xu Xueseng's tragic injuries at the courthouse door and felt compassion. He then arranged to meet Xu through someone and handed over the letters that lawyer Xu Lin had just presented to the court for use as evidence. If he was called to testify in court, he would certainly appear in court to confront them. This was his testimony. If he was found to have lied in any way, he would accept severe punishment. At this point, the official announced that the hearing would be adjourned, and that both parties must submit all evidence without delay. Finally, lawyer Xu Lin stated that Gao Jinsheng was an extremely poor vagrant before his imprisonment, but after his imprisonment, he suddenly became a temporary millionaire. The court was urged to investigate the Gao Jinsheng detention center to determine the amount of money currently in Gao's possession, which would provide an easy indication of the truth. The official stated that this was within the court's scope of authority and ordered Zhu Guanghan to remain released on bail and await further hearings. The hearing was adjourned, and it was already six o'clock, and the city was lit up when they left the courthouse.</p>

<p>The Cargo Was Damaged by Water</p>
<p>The Hai Rui steamer, owned by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, with a deadweight of 2,049 tons, originally operated between Shanghai and Lianyungang. Recently, due to the accumulation of cargo on the South China route, the steamer was reassigned to the Shantou and Guangzhou route. This time, it loaded a large amount of cargo in Shanghai and first went to Shantou to unload. However, the ship encountered a severe storm off the port of Shantou. The waves were enormous. In the most dangerous moments, the waves crashed over the ship and directly into the pilothouse. Five bales of cotton on the deck were swept into the sea. Seawater also entered the large cargo hold, damaging part of the cargo. The losses were significant. Upon arriving in Shantou, it was necessary to first unload the cargo and handle the general average. The shipowner had already telegraphed the bureau to report the incident. However, when the ship arrived in Shantou, seven crew members boarded a sampan to go ashore. Before reaching the pier, a barge from the pier came from the outside and collided with the sampan. The sampan was already old and dilapidated. After the collision, it immediately leaked and sank into the harbor. The seven crew members also fell into the water. Five people were rescued on the spot, but two were still missing: one was the chief steward (the cook) of the Hai Rui, and the other was Tai Li (the cargo supervisor). Repeated searches failed to find even their bodies. The incident has been telegraphed to Shanghai. The Hai Rui will return to Shanghai after loading all the cargo at the ports in Guangzhou and Guangdong. A telegram was received yesterday stating that the ship was already on its return voyage. Detailed information about the incident will be available after the shipowner and purser arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Her Lover Also Swallowed Opium Paste; As a Result, the Woman Died Tragically</p>
<p>Wang Zengjun, also known as Monk, a local man, 26 years old, worked as an ironing clerk at the Lao Shanghai Laundry Shop at No. 79 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, in the French Concession. Shen Qian, a Suzhou woman, 47 years old, residing at No. 5, Gong'an Lane, Aiduo'a Road, had previously worked as a servant in a brothel and now made a living as a peddler. She had a daughter named Jinshu, also known as Axiao, 18 years old, who also sold sweet rice porridge. The mother and daughter lived together. Wang Zengjun was unmarried. In July, he met Shen Jinshu and fell in love at first sight. They were deeply in love and moved to Room 29, New Life Apartment, No. 29 Hengmao Lane, and have been living together for over three months. They had promised to stay together until their hair turned white. However, Jinshu had been betrothed by her mother last year to a family surnamed XX in the countryside, and the wedding was scheduled for the third day of the ninth lunar month. The day before yesterday (the 11th) morning, Shen Qian went to the New Life Apartment to urge her daughter Jinshu to return to the city to purchase dowry items and then return to the countryside to prepare for the wedding. Jinshu regretted the marriage and could not bear to separate from Wang, so she decided to end her life. She went out and bought six balls of raw opium paste and swallowed four with wine to commit suicide. After taking the poison, she returned to the New Life Apartment and told Wang that she had committed suicide by taking poison. Wang found the remaining two opium paste balls beside her. Fearing that he would be held responsible for her death, he also bought wine and swallowed the opium paste to express his love and willingness to die together. After taking the poison, Wang saw that Jinshu was still conscious and could be saved, so he took her and a companion to Puqing Hospital at No. 730 Guangdong Road for help. As the doctor Zhang Yi was trying to save her, Wang also collapsed from the poison. He was then resuscitated and vomited out the poison, but Jinshu was already unconscious. The doctor ordered Wang to transfer her to Baolong Hospital. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Jinshu died. The hospital reported the incident to the police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy room. Wang was taken into custody for interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Wang, an inspector of the Second Special Court, arrived at the hall and confirmed that Shen Jinshu had died from poisoning. After questioning the deceased's mother, Shen Qian, and Wang Zengjun, the official ordered that the woman's body be handed over to her mother for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Police Chief Accused of Abuse of Power and Illegal Detention <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Ju Jin, the chief of the Yinxianggang Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, formerly the chief of the Fifth District Fourth Branch, is now being sued in the Local Court Criminal Division by Liu Yueming, Lu Shanben, etc., for abuse of power and illegal detention. They claim that he protected the defendants Li Guang and Liu Yulai and illegally detained them. Therefore, in addition to suing Ju, they are also suing Li Guang and Liu Yulai for assault and fraud. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Peiming held a joint hearing. Liu Yueming stated that he was 46 years old, from Yancheng, and resided at Zhangjiabang, north of Gaolangqiao. On September 29, he sold two pigs that he had raised. Li Guang and Liu Yulai demanded two dollars from him. Because he had no cash, they refused to allow him to sell the pigs. His friend Lu Shanben came out to mediate and was injured in one eye by them. When they went to the Fifth District Fourth Branch, the police chief instead detained them for three days and released them, ordering him to pay ten dollars as soon as he returned home, or else they would arrest him again. Therefore, he was suing them. Lu Shanben stated that he was 46 years old, from Funing. Li Guang, etc., demanded two dollars from Liu Yueming, who was selling pigs. Because he had no cash, they wanted to beat him. He went to persuade them and was also beaten by them. Li Guang stated that he was 35 years old, from Funing, and an employee of Chen Dexing Pig Shop. Because they were selling pigs privately, his boss told him and Liu Yulai to investigate. He told them to go to the pig shop together, but they beat him. They went to the police station to report the incident because they violated health regulations, so they were fined. Liu Yulai stated that he was 54 years old, from Funing, and his statement was the same as Li's. Police Chief Ju Jin stated that he was 40 years old, from Jiangyin, and the chief of the Yinxianggang Police Station. At the time of the incident, Li Guang reported to the Zhangjiahong Branch that the case was due to a fight and they were sent to the station. There was no mention of injuries, so they were each fined one dollar. Because Lu had no money, he was detained for one day. Liu Yueming was brought in by the police sergeant because he violated the health bureau's regulations and was fined two dollars and detained for two days. The official announced that the case should be investigated further and that another hearing would be held.</p>

He is leisurely and content. Zhang Shaoyun, a former subordinate of Commander Yang, has recently been unemployed and is staying at Yang's house. In July of this year, Yang's ten-year-old son, Abao, suddenly disappeared one day. Later, a letter was received from the kidnappers demanding a ransom of 500,000 yuan, revealing that his son Abao had been kidnapped. At the same time, Zhang Ziyun, who was staying at Yang's house, also suddenly left. It was suspected that Zhang was heavily involved in Abao's kidnapping. He reported the incident to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which began an investigation. Zhang Ziyun was arrested a few days ago and confessed after one interrogation. He also revealed his accomplice, Bao Chongfu (43 years old, from Siyang), who runs a coffin shop and a public stove at No. 21351 Xiaoshabo Road in the Public Concession. At 5:50 AM yesterday morning, Xue Shilin, the leader of the branch team of the Detective Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with detective Wang Peiting, reported to the Putuo Road Police Station and, with the cooperation of detective Zhang Changkun, went to the address and arrested Bao Chongfu. At 9:30 AM, they escorted him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent Captain Xue along with the arrested Zhang Ziyun to the court and requested permission to transfer them for further investigation to find out where the kidnapped child was. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, agreed to the transfer. Bao Chongfu stated that he had a long-standing feud with Zhang Ziyun and that he had cheated him out of money. He was about to arrest him, but he falsely accused him first, which was hateful. Judge Fu ordered that Bao Chongfu be handed over to the officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be taken back for interrogation and ordered that a formal official document be submitted for record.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Ye Ruizhen Sues Ye Zhongfang: Division of Deceased Father's Estate; Ruizhen is Illegitimate, Zhongfang Does Not Acknowledge; Court Orders Identity to be Confirmed First <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Ye Huanyu, a Chinese comprador of the insurance department of the China Business Company on Sichuan Road, from Wuxian County, Jiangsu, died of illness on July 11 of this year. His position and property were all inherited by his adopted son, Zhongfang (45 years old, residing at No. 29, Jiwu Lane, Ximen Road). Ye Huanyu had taken several concubines during his lifetime, who lived separately. One of them, Wu, was also one of Ye's concubines, residing at No. XX, 852 Nong, Chengdu Road. On February 28, 1932, she committed suicide by secretly consuming raw opium due to some reason. She left behind a daughter named Ruizhen, who is now 17 years old. On February 5 of this year, she participated in the sixth group wedding organized by the Municipal Government and married Wu Junqing (also known as Wending, 22 years old, residing at No. 27, Wenzhou Road), who is from the same hometown. Because Ye Zhongfang denies Wu Ye Ruizhen's identity, Wu Ye Ruizhen hired lawyer Li Zhongwen and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against her brother Ye Zhongfang for embezzlement of inheritance. The gist of the complaint is that the plaintiff is the daughter of Ye Huanyu, and the defendant is Ye Huanyu's nephew, who was adopted as his son. After Huan Tu died, the plaintiff returned home to attend the funeral, but the defendant refused to allow her to wear mourning clothes. The plaintiff then sent a letter of inquiry through a lawyer on September 20 and ordered that the inheritance be handed over for division. The defendant replied through a lawyer, saying that Huan Tu had no daughter like the plaintiff, claiming that the inheritance had been used to pay off debts, clearly showing his intention to embezzle the inheritance. As for the plaintiff's identity, there are official and private documents that can prove it. As for Huan Tu's inheritance, there are residential properties in Suzhou, stocks, savings, etc. Therefore, it is requested that he be punished under Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and that he be ordered to hand over the entire inheritance for notarization and division by elders of the clan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo held a preliminary hearing in Criminal Division 2. Wu Ye Ruizhen first stated her charges. When questioned, Ye Zhongfang stated that he had never seen the plaintiff, so he did not know who she was. When his lawyer received the letter, he investigated and learned that she was the daughter of his deceased father's concubine, so he could not recognize her. The court then asked if he was willing to share Huan Yu's inheritance with her, and he replied that his father had no inheritance to share. The court asked if it was because he could not recognize the plaintiff's identity that he would not share the inheritance, or was it because there was no inheritance to share? He replied that it was because his father had no inheritance. The plaintiff's lawyer Li then presented a copy of the group marriage certificate to prove that Ye Huanyu was the officiant, and requested that the court examine the autopsy records of the Procuratorate after Ye Wu (the plaintiff's mother) committed suicide, as well as the plaintiff's school records when she was studying at the Mei Baige Road Renhe Elementary School in the second semester of 1932 and the first semester of 1933, which could all prove that the plaintiff was indeed Huan Tu's daughter. He also submitted Ye Huanyu's obituary, in which the name of the plaintiff's husband, Wu Wending, was also listed. It was also stated that Ye Huanyu's property included a residence in Suzhou, No. XX Jiuxiang, worth about 8,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan in shares in the Rui Tai Cloth Shop, 3,000 yuan in savings, 1,000 yuan in shares in the Yongyuan Cloth Shop, 8,000 yuan in shares in the Dafeng Factory, 9,000 yuan in claims from acting as a comprador for the Boshen Foreign Firm, and a diamond ring worth 2,000 yuan and a string of pearls pledged by others to Ye Huanyu, etc. The court then asked if the obituary presented by the plaintiff's lawyer was genuine, to which he replied that it was indeed issued by his family. He also invited Hua Maosheng to court and stated that the case should first confirm the plaintiff's identity through civil proceedings. After reviewing the records, the judge announced that the case would be adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Further News on Wang Enzhao's Death by Poisoning <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Enzhao, an accountant at the Central Aviation School and formerly the founder and manager of the Dahua Real Estate Company in Shanghai, was invited by a friend to serve as assistant manager of the Jia Hua Bank in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934]. The bank collapsed in the same year. Mr. Wang's nerves were severely stimulated, leading to abnormalities and insomnia. Last year, he transferred to the aviation school. Due to heavy workload, he recently took leave to come to Shanghai for medical treatment. He resided at the Yang residence, number 559 on Route Lafayette [today's Fuxing Middle Road], a relative's home. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 8th, due to persistent insomnia, he took too many sleeping pills, leading to poisoning. It was not until noon on the 9th that the family members of the Yang residence discovered him. They rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for emergency treatment, but due to the long delay, it was impossible to save him. He passed away at 4:30 PM. His family members then transported the body to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor on Xujiahui Road for the encoffining ceremony at 2:00 PM on the 11th. Over a hundred relatives and friends of the Wang family, including Zhang Yongni, Zhao Jinqing, Qu Wenliu, Huang Ruisheng, Hu Xirong, Hu Jingchuan, Ding Jiwan, and Zhou Jinghan, all went to express their condolences. Mr. Wang is survived by his wife, Mrs. Ding, and two sons, Zhigang and Zhimin, who are still very young, one seven years old and the other six. It is said that Mr. Wang's family was very harmonious. Yesterday's report that there was discord between Mr. Wang's mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was untrue, and the mistaken name of Wang Guangzhu was also a misunderstanding. Mr. Wang's tragic death was caused by insomnia in the near term and by the collapse of the Jia Hua Bank in the long term. Mr. Wang took responsibility too seriously, leading to a pathological condition of his nerves. Mr. Wang was only 34 years old, at the prime of his life, and his sudden passing has left his relatives and friends in deep sorrow and mourning. His coffin is currently temporarily placed in the Shaoxing Guild Hall, and a memorial service will be held on a chosen date.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We are writing in response to a report from the Dagong News Agency published in your newspaper on October 12th. After investigation, we find that it differs greatly from the facts. Our factory has always treated its workers generously. Unexpectedly, in the midst of this tense situation, a small number of weaving department workers, including He Gencai and Xu Xuewen, used false pretenses to coerce workers, extort membership fees, and disrupt the machines. Our factory, in addition to legally dismissing those with serious offenses, still maintained its past policy of leniency and issued a sincere notice on the 2nd of this month, urging workers to return to work. Unexpectedly, they became even more aggravated and, on the 7th, led their accomplices to Hengfeng Road to assault workers who came to the factory. On the 9th, they led a crowd to rush into the weaving machine room in an attempt to force a strike and shut down the motors, causing some well-intentioned workers to retreat. Currently, except for a portion of workers in the weaving department who have been forced to stop work, all other departments in our factory are operating as usual. All the detailed circumstances have been reported by our factory to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. We are afraid that the outside world will not understand and be misled, so we are writing to request a prompt correction to clarify the situation. This is to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper. Respectfully, Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Factory, October 12th.</p>

<p>The Education Department of Jiangsu Province has stated that the province's measures for transferring students to vocational schools are implemented in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, following Chapter 10 of the regulations for middle schools and normal schools. However, the regulations stipulate that the subjects studied by transfer students must be the same. The department has recently found this regulation to be difficult and has specially requested the Ministry of Education to approve a flexible approach. Students who have completed one semester of ordinary senior or junior high school and wish to transfer to the first semester of the first year of an equivalent vocational school will be allowed to enter the class. However, vocational school students will still not be allowed to transfer to ordinary middle schools or normal schools to indicate restrictions. The Ministry of Education has issued instructions stating: "Noted the report. Approval is granted as proposed. However, vocational schools that accept transfer students must have a study period of three years, and the academic performance of the admitted transfer students in each major subject from their original school must be passing." After receiving the order, the Education Department has instructed its subordinates to comply.</p>

<p>Wanqing Experimental School on Fuhougang, Central Road, Nanjing, is the only place in the capital (and in the country) for experimental gifted education. Founder Ai Xianzhou and Principal Fan Bingxin are managing it with great dedication and painstaking effort. In the past two years, the school has been thriving. Although the number of applicants for the autumn semester was very enthusiastic, the school only admitted 24 students per grade, preferring to leave vacancies rather than lower standards. There are currently fifty students in grades one, two, and three. Some of them come from the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Xiaozhuang, dozens of miles away from the school, which shows the trust of parents in the school. The qualifications of the school's teachers have been gradually improved, all of whom are hired from Beiping and speak pure Mandarin. For example, the art and music teachers Ms. Xu Bohua and Ms. Zhonghua are graduates of the Art Department of the Tianjin Hebei Women's Normal College. The Mandarin teacher Ms. Zhang Nailan is a graduate of the Chinese Literature Department of the Women's Normal College and has taught in Beiping for many years. All other teachers are very knowledgeable and experienced. The school follows the British school system and emphasizes outdoor education. Recently, a pavilion has been built at a high point in the schoolyard, named "Spring Breeze," which will be used as a music and singing classroom.

<p>— Investigation by Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>9. Teacher Cultivation</p>
<p>Teachers in Japanese schools are all called staff members because they believe that teachers are also a type of official. The school attaches great importance to the cultivation of teachers. The school has research departments for each subject, with the principal appointing a director and several members to hold regular research meetings. Student achievement assessments are conducted at regular intervals to allow teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of teaching and the appropriateness of materials. On commemorative days, teachers take turns giving lectures to children. When famous people from outside the school come to give lectures, teachers also participate in listening.</p>
<p>There are five types of teacher training meetings. The entire faculty and staff meet once a week, chaired by the principal, to discuss important school matters. Teaching method research meetings are held irregularly to discuss theoretical and practical issues related to teaching. Teachers are also required to participate in summer training courses in Japan on a rotating basis and report back to the other teachers upon their return. Grade meetings are attended by teachers responsible for guidance in each grade to thoroughly discuss teaching materials and issues related to guidance and care. Reading and presentation meetings are held frequently, with teachers reporting on the content of the books they have read.</p>
<p>In addition, teachers also have external visits. The principal designates the schools to be visited or the teachers make suggestions which are approved by the principal. Sometimes, the principal may assign teachers to visit and inspect new facilities in various fields and make a report on the inspection upon returning to the school. Teachers may also go to various companies, factories, or research institutes to learn about teaching methods and collect reference materials. Teachers also regularly engage in sports, such as tennis, baseball, table tennis, and volleyball, to improve their physical health.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Reflections on Participating in the World Games and Traveling in Europe - A Postscript to the Sino-British Match (Continued) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huitang</p>
<p>The inspiration from this overseas compatriot who warmly cares about our football team is indeed very touching, and at the same time, it greatly strengthened our courage and increased our infinite vigor. We knew that compared to our first confrontation, we at least had some advantages. This was because we knew the British team's playing style and strategy well, while the British team knew nothing about our Eastern team.</p>
<p>On July 29th, the British team arrived. Their dormitory was only a stone's throw away from ours. As soon as I had the chance, I talked to their coach. I first inquired about their background. He said that four members of the team were from the Scottish GreenPark team (the only amateur team to join the Scottish professional first division), and nine members were from the famous English amateur teams Casuals and Corinthians. The other players were selected from amateur international teams in Ireland and Wales. He also said that they originally did not want to participate, but decided to send a team at the last minute, so they lacked training beforehand. Many of the team members did not even know each other's names. Understanding each other would probably require a lot of hard work quickly. Knowing this, I realized that this British team was a combination of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and not just the strength of England alone. Bringing together the best players from various regions, their combat power would naturally be very strong. However, we had undergone long-term training and cooperation, while they did not even know each other. This was also a small advantage for us. In the days before the game, whenever they practiced, I secretly observed their strengths and weaknesses. On average, their footwork was better than ours, their kicks were more powerful, their bodies were larger, and their strength was more abundant. Judging from these points alone, it would not be easy for us to deal with them. After arriving in Berlin, they were also very careful and vigilant, avoiding friendly matches, so their tactics could not be investigated. But no matter what, we still held a glimmer of hope in despair and did not completely lose heart.</p>
<p>The Games opened, and there were still six days until the match. Apart from watching track and field and football, it was truly a torturous time. In the Nanyang area, we were accustomed to playing at least three or more games a week. Although it was hard work, we were used to it. This time, we had been resting without playing for more than twenty days, which was indeed a bit uncomfortable in our hearts, and we couldn't sleep soundly at night, eagerly awaiting the arrival of the match. Our entire team was suffering from "Over Anxiety," and this unhealthy mentality was probably one of the reasons for our failure.</p>
<p>Time flew by, and it was August 6th before we knew it. After very careful and close discussions, we put out the following lineup:</p>
<p>Ye Beihua, Tan Jiangbai, Chen Zhenhe, Sun Jinshun</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Huang Meishun, Li Huitang, Li Tiansheng, Xu Yahui, Feng Jingxiang, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>On that day, in addition to the athletes who were participating in other sports, the rest of our delegation were all present to watch the match. The overseas Chinese in Berlin also came to cheer us on, and formed two cheering squads to cheer for our team. Everyone's enthusiasm and kindness were truly appreciated. When the bell rang five times, the two teams walked side by side to the center of the field and bowed to the audience on both sides (according to the rules of the Games). Our team won the toss and chose to have the advantage of facing away from the sun. The great battle erupted, and our team took the offensive in one go, sometimes attacking from the flanks and sometimes attacking from the center. The opponent was caught off guard for a while. For the first fifteen minutes, almost the entire field belonged to our team. Once, Shun got a cross from Guicheng fifteen yards from the goal. If he had stopped and shot, he would have definitely scored, but he was too anxious at the time, and kicked the ball as soon as it arrived, resulting in inaccuracy, and it went out one foot from the post. We lost this ball, which was probably fate. It should be known that in a situation of equal strength, the gain or loss of a goal often determines the outcome. Afterwards, although the British team launched several counterattacks, they did not pose a serious threat. Soon after, I was hit in the abdomen by the opponent's defender, and my breath was blocked. After treatment, I resumed the game. The first half ended without any score. However, the spectators in the field all thought that our team's performance was good and that we had the upper hand. Not being able to win in the first half was actually a precursor to our failure in the second half. Missing a good opportunity is still regrettable even now. After the break, we returned to the field. Our team fought hard for twenty-five minutes, but still no result. It wasn't until the twenty-eighth minute that their right winger crossed the ball, our defender made a mistake, and their left forward broke through the net near the goal, opening the scoring. At this time, our team's strength gradually became insufficient, and the opponent took advantage of their lead to repeatedly threaten us. Finally, within ten minutes, with similar passes, their center forward scored another goal, and the victory or defeat was thus determined. Although our team still put up a desperate fight, and I and Jingxiang took long shots one after another, they were all unsuccessful. When the bell rang, our team was eliminated with a score of two to zero, unable to aspire to the title again, and had to watch others compete for the trophy.</p>
<p>Although we lost this game, our performance was still acceptable, leaving a very good impression and earning very good reviews from the media. We also had a good performance in terms of sportsmanship. However, in my opinion, we did not show our full strength that day. The games in Nanyang, the game against India, the game in Yangon, and the games in Singapore were more exciting and wonderful in comparison. This was probably because of the long break and the "Over-Anxiety" mentioned above. After the game, Shen Siliang told me that he was not very satisfied with the left side of the forward line, which missed more than one good opportunity. According to the observations of our Director Rong and Manager Huang, they both thought that if Ji Liang had been used as goalkeeper that day, both goals could have been saved. I also agree with these three insightful people, because Jinshun and Beihua were both getting fat and slow. Although Jiaping was more experienced and agile as a goalkeeper, due to his height, he was not as brave as Ji Liang in saving dangerous shots. Both goals that day were very close to the goal. If the goalkeeper had been more assertive, he should have come out to save the ball. Afterwards, many people involved said that if we had used the following lineup, the result might have been different:</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang, Tan Jiangbai, Chen Zhenhe, Ye Beihua</p>
<p>Huang Jiliang, Xu Yahui, Li Huitang, Li Tiansheng, Liang Rongzhao, Feng Jingxiang</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Although this argument is not without merit, hindsight is unreliable. How do we know that if we had used the above lineup to face the enemy, we would not have suffered an even more disastrous defeat? My only regret is that the British team was conquered by the mediocre Polish team in the second week due to goalkeeping errors. This comparison made us seem even smaller. In fact, to be honest, apart from physique, strength, and running speed, which we can't catch up with, our skills are not much inferior to others.</p>
<p>"Only after learning do you realize your deficiencies; only after realizing your deficiencies can you reflect on yourself." I only hope that this defeat will give us a good lesson and give us an opportunity to reflect on ourselves after returning home.</p>

<p>The Municipal National Sports School held its opening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday at the school site. Classes officially started in the afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>More than 200 Guests and Students</p>
<p>The auditorium was set up under the west grandstand of the large sports field. The attendees included Principal Wu Tiecheng, Director of General Affairs Song Dazhang, Director of Academic Affairs Fang Wanbang, Director of the Health Bureau Li Tingan, Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Yi, Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jingjun, Director of the Finance Bureau Xu Fu, Chairman of the Municipal Council Wang Xiaolai, as well as the school's faculty, staff, students, and guests, totaling more than 200 people. After the ceremony, Director of General Affairs Song Dazhang reported on the preparations.</p>
<p>Principal Wu Tiecheng Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>Following this, Principal Wu delivered a speech, stating that the municipal government had been planning to establish a comprehensive sports school since building the sports field two years ago. However, due to financial and political circumstances, it had been delayed. Now, stimulated by participating in the World Games, they deeply felt that no matter how difficult it was, they had to establish a sports school as soon as possible, first to fully utilize this great sports field, cultivate qualified sports instructors, and serve the city, in order to correct the one-sided errors in the sports world; and second, to forge a sound physique as the foundation for the revitalization of the nation, striving to integrate sports and military affairs, and cultivate obedient, hardworking, self-governing, brave, mutually helpful, united, and disciplined people from the strict New Life Movement to guide society, break the arrogance of the "sick man of East Asia," and eliminate the morbid state of complacency, complacency, self-abandonment, cowardice, selfishness, and disorder, in order to fulfill the mission of strengthening the country and preserving the race.</p>
<p>Director of Academic Affairs Fang Wanbang's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Director of Academic Affairs Fang Wanbang gave a speech, stating that students should strive to improve in all aspects, including educational principles, sports fundamentals, life philosophy, science, morality, and hygiene. The school's academic plans included three aspects: (1) enriching the curriculum, (2) strict management, and (3) disciplined life. Finally, guest Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating that using the sports field to establish a sports school was making the best use of the land and talent. Although there were already three sports schools in Shanghai, none of them were as large as this school. Land and people are the essential elements of a country. A strong nation requires strong people to defend its territory, and then prosperity can be expected. At 12:00, after the group photo, the principal led the guests to visit the school's various facilities, and classes began in the afternoon.</p>

<p>— (Zhou Mengmo)</p>
<p>How can you get a fruit without a cause? The fruit is originally the price of the cause. Only by planting a cause of hard work and effort can you reap a fruit of success. Friends: Let's not simply lament and be depressed about the harshness of the environment. Know that depression is the grave of ambition; despondency is the trap of self-degradation. Only if we resolutely and bravely rise up, cut through the thorns, and work hard will we have the chance to step onto the bright and splendid road to success.</p>
<p>A small match seems not worth people's attention; but its use, simply experience it in daily life, and you will realize its great contribution to mankind, deeply containing the meaning of "sacrificing oneself for righteousness." We should use it to constantly remind ourselves and learn a lesson: that is, to make our lives fulfilling and valuable, and only by embracing the spirit of sacrifice can we live a good life.</p>
<p>The waves in the sea are turbulent and surging, making shocking sounds, and the destructive power of the water is invincible. This is the power of waves pushing waves, the power of unity. If we, China, with its vast land and abundant resources, can unite as one and constantly strive for self-improvement, will we still sit in sorrow and suffer the tragedy of being invaded by the great powers and losing territory?</p>
<h3 id="e188">Somersaults <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>My childhood life in my hometown was happy. When there was a "caotai" opera, it was like the sky falling down. Early in the morning, the guys would put the pine benches on a small cart and push them to the theater to set up the stands. As soon as the opera started, I and the other children were already running around under the stage. Like a wild horse, my mom couldn't control me, and neither could my dad. I couldn't sit still on the stand for a moment. Sesame candy couldn't fool me, and neither could beef dumplings. However, as long as the stage performed martial arts scenes with painted faces doing somersaults, I would climb onto the stand, open my eyes wide, and watch attentively.</p>
<p>Loving to watch somersaults was probably my natural inclination. The skinny monkey with a painted face who could do more than a dozen somersaults in a row was the one I admired the most. The more he sweated and couldn't breathe, the louder my little hands clapped, following others shouting "Good, good, good." Later, a young actor ran out on the stage, about the same age as me, but his somersaults were not good, not agile, and he almost rolled off the stage. I laughed, laughing at his uselessness, thinking: If I did it, I would definitely do better than him.</p>
<p>Later, I actually tried to do a somersault myself. I remember it was when my third aunt was sewing a quilt in the drying yard. I took off my shoes and walked onto the soft cotton batting, bent over, supported myself with my hands, and put my head on the batting, wanting to flip my feet upwards, but it didn't work. I failed once, twice. Finally, with the help of my little uncle, he held my legs up, and I flipped over, but my head was dizzy, my eyes were blurred, and my arms hurt. I could only admire the young actor again, feeling that his skills were a hundred times better than mine, and I shouldn't have laughed at him—</p>
<p>Since I learned that doing somersaults is hard work, every time I see an actor doing somersaults on stage, I can't bear to clap my hands and shout "Good." Taking pleasure in others' suffering, how can that be justified? However, in today's world, people suffer thousands of hardships and can't even get a little applause, let alone sympathy. People are tormented in life, just like doing somersaults. The worst thing is to fall off the stage after a somersault, earning the audience's boisterous "boos."</p>
<p>Occasionally, while drinking with friends in a hotel, I suddenly saw a child who looked about nine years old doing somersaults in front of the table. He didn't do them very well, but he flipped harder and harder. Then, with a pale face, he stretched out his ink-black palms to beg for pennies from the drinkers. This discovery was like a sudden awakening: at such a young age, he was relying on doing somersaults to try to earn a living. Thinking back to the past, I felt a pang of sadness in my heart.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Autumn and Middle Age <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>A person's youth is like the first season of the year – spring, with its splendid scenery and vibrant energy, truly beautiful and lovely. Entering adulthood is like summer; though flowers fall and spring fades, the lush green leaves and sturdy branches display great health. The fiery heat, grand ambition, and sharp, soaring spirit resemble the intimidating nature of the blazing summer sun. As one enters middle age, that expansive embrace and courageous spirit gradually dissipate. This is akin to transitioning from summer to autumn. Unknowingly, as the climate progresses, one gradually moves towards desolation. Even oneself is bewildered as to how today's self differs so greatly from yesterday's. As for what happens after autumn? Let that be vague; no need to imagine it further.</p>
<p>"It's hard to be a middle-aged person," "Middle-aged sorrow." If heaven were conscious, it would surely share the same feelings about this season of autumn. Indeed, in every comparison, middle age and autumn, autumn and middle age, are remarkably similar. The unpredictable wind and rain of autumn are like the constant stimulation of life in middle age. The sounds of insects in the autumn fields, so plaintive and yearning, so like weeping and lamenting, are just like a middle-aged person's feeling of being unable to escape the nagging about firewood and rice from his wife, or to alleviate the hunger and cries of his children. The fallen leaves that fill the steps in autumn, swept away only to be replaced by more, are like the frequent disappointments and unshakeable sorrows of middle age. Isn't this cold autumn visage and desolate autumn mood sufficient to symbolize the expression and heart of a middle-aged person? However, autumn also has joys compared to other seasons, such as the exceptionally bright moon in the mid-sky. This is just like the mind of a middle-aged person, which, like a mirror, sees through all the evils of the world, understands all its changes, and has an increasingly clear understanding of the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, although autumn is said to be melancholy and sorrowful, only middle-aged people can truly understand and appreciate it, merging with autumn, stirring up melancholy and sorrow into a pile. Youth and adulthood fundamentally lack autumn; where does sorrow come from? Where does grief originate?</p>
<h3 id="e190">Random Musings on the Double Tenth <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>Ten placed side by side form "廿," commonly read as "nian." In the past, there was a princess whose name was twenty (二十), who was favored and held power. People in the folk called the number twenty "nian" to avoid using the name of the princess. This practice has persisted to this day. Therefore, the Double Tenth Festival, established as National Day, should be eternally remembered in the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>The Double Tenth as twenty (廿) also resembles the grass radical in Chinese characters. Is it that this Double Tenth Festival, with its serious, extremely tragic, and passionate significance, in the past history of our Republic of China, has often been carelessly and superficially celebrated during difficult times, so that the number and the symbol coincide, predestined? What we hope for from now on is that for all that can be done to secure the nation's destiny on a foundation of rock, and to advance the Double Tenth Festival to a magnificent and glorious realm, all of us as a nation should strive in the spirit of pioneering and constantly strengthen ourselves. May we see the national spirit on Double Tenth Day in the future be like strong grass in a fierce wind, far from the sight of grass bending before the wind. Wouldn't that be joyous?</p>
<p>A certain gentleman, fond of novelty, suddenly had a whimsical idea. He collected commemorative stamps issued for the Double Tenth Festival of the tenth year of the Republic, insisting that they be those postmarked at 10:00 AM on that day. He actually obtained a complete set: one-cent, three-cent, six-cent, and ten-cent stamps, each with a clear and recognizable postmark. He then mounted them and kept them hidden. This commemorative stamp, marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of Chinese post, coming together by chance, is like a surviving treasure. Now, it happens to be the Double Tenth Festival of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, another coincidence! The stamp features portraits of Xu Shichang and two others, printed in different colors. This old man is also the only surviving treasure among the former presidents of the Republic! The owner recently expressed his intention to "reluctantly part with his coral." Asking about it at the Liangchen Haoyou Society on Beijing Road, five yuan in legal tender could exchange for it. This is also a fine tale for the Double Tenth Festival. Telling the readers, it is permissible to act quickly.</p>
<p>Double is even, and ten is complete. Using these to name the National Day is a well-wishing and auspicious act! However, this is formed by the heroic spirit and hot blood of the martyrs. Looking to the south, the heroic aura of Huanghuagang soars into the clouds. Startling the north, the ghostly flames of the Heilongjiang turn green. If this golden jar is not mended, how can we face the martyrs in the afterlife?</p>

<h3 id="e191">The Third Landlord and the Fourth Tenant <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Gong</p>
<p>—— One of Shanghai's Special Products</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth gold. The high land prices and exorbitant rents are astonishing. The prevalence of the second landlord system further forces ordinary residents to waste more money on rent, yet they cannot find a reasonably satisfactory place to live, increasing their complaints and grievances. However, those who become third tenants are trapped by economic hardship and have no choice but to drink poison to quench their thirst, keeping their eyes wide open as they endure the abuse of the second landlord!</p>
<p>In the inland areas, poor small citizens or impoverished households who cannot afford to rent an entire house on their own, there are also many families who live together within a large gate. In Beijing, this is called a "big courtyard." Living here is limited to extremely destitute small families. Those who consider themselves middle or upper class, no matter how poor they may be, would rather die than stoop down and mix with them, fearing that it would diminish their noble personality and tarnish their clean reputation. But these are all directly rented out by the main landlord. Occasionally, a tenant, because there are more houses than people, wants to save expenses and sublets the remaining rooms to others. This is not unheard of, but it accounts for only a very small number. As for using this to make a profit, relying on it as a way to make money and support oneself, or even not living there themselves, but specifically renting several rooms to store merchandise or personal property, that only exists in Shanghai's so-called second landlord system.</p>
<p>Shanghai's society is inherently a deformed organization, and its contents are so dark that it is horrifying. Therefore, it easily generates many special classes and performs countless ghostly tricks. The second landlord is one of these special classes. I often say that the main reason why most residents of Shanghai experience hardship and economic pressure is not due to the high cost of living, but because of those vermin parasitic on the dark side of this society, who layer upon layer exploit the masses. Thus, the poor become poorer, the suffering suffer more, while they do not till the land or weave clothes, but rely on cleverly sucking the fat from the poor. One by one, they become fat-headed and big-bellied, looking quite good.</p>
<p>The second landlord's only occupation is to take advantage of the high cost of rent and the weak economic capacity of most citizens. They advance a sum of money to rent a number of houses, and then sublet them room by room at even more exorbitant prices, acting as intermediaries who manipulate the market, sitting back and reaping the benefits. With a mere turn of the hand, they can not only live rent-free but also solve their living problems. In the heyday of the French Concession a few years ago, houses in the Baoyu Li and Baoxing Li areas were particularly expensive due to their central location and high demand, with each wing room renting for around a hundred yuan. Yet, those who came to rent were still fighting over them, and some were even willing to pay extra fees to become second landlords. At that time, as long as you rented a three-story house, you could easily earn several hundred yuan a month. Can you find such a good business anywhere else but Shanghai? Furthermore, if there were any natural disasters or man-made calamities in other places, such as the Qi-Lu War or the great flood in Hankou, people with some resources would flee to Shanghai to take refuge. That would be another good opportunity for them to hoard goods and extort high prices. (Many economic experts specifically found excuses to ask the original third tenants to move out, and then reposted rental notices, with the whole family sleeping on the floor under the stairs, freeing up the rooms to rent to refugees, hoping to make a big fortune during this period.) The main landlord who owns the property cannot share this right. In the past two years, Shanghai has also been surrounded by a recession. The market is sluggish, credit is tight, and even Nanjing Road, the most prosperous commercial street, has many vacant rooms. Shops sealed with "ten" signs for rent arrears and defaults are everywhere. The call for rent reduction is rising to the clouds. At this time, the second landlords may secretly worry about the shaking of their position, and of course, the profits they receive are not what they used to be. However, in any case, they will not do business at a loss! (However, recently, there are many who post empty room signs, and many third tenants who cannot pay the rent. If the skin does not exist, what will the hair attach to? Therefore, under today's circumstances, the second landlord can be both possible and impossible!)</p>
<p>In the past, the second landlords were mostly parasites who squeezed the marrow and sweat of the third tenants. Most residents suffered increased burdens because of them, living in even more expensive houses. They demanded rent more fiercely than the main landlord. At the main landlord's place, you could still owe rent for three months, but the second landlord would not allow a day's delay. That cold, icy, and impartially ruthless expression was even uglier than that of Yama Bao. Therefore, they often had conflicts with the third tenants, almost like enemies, rarely living in peace. Furthermore, the brightness of the electric light and the duration of the night light became the focus of disputes between the two sides. (Of course, there are also many second landlords with noble behavior who do not aim to make a profit. When subletting the remaining rooms, they are unwilling to easily rent them out to other than upstanding tenants. But these are ultimately fewer than those who hoard and profit, especially hard to find in the slums!)</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that there is also a kind of third landlord. He is originally a third tenant, renting a large room or two from the second landlord. If he encounters someone willing to pay a higher rent, he sees that there is profit to be made and sublets half of it to someone else. Generally, he also posts a "Available Room for Rent" sign, finally getting to experience being a landlord, finally becoming a member of the bourgeoisie. Because there are third landlords, there are also so-called fourth tenants. These people are naturally a little better off than those whose mansions are set up in straw sheds!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Brotherly Affection Hides Letter, Pities Weak Sister; Noble Air of Poetry and Books Peeks at Shadow, Laughs at Poor Scholar</p>
<p>It was summer, and the slopes around the small nunnery were covered with green grass, an inch long, like a green carpet spread on the ground. Although there were few trees, the fences of the vegetable gardens were covered with green vines. Inside the short walls of the vegetable garden, rows of sunflower stalks and piles of melon trellises added some interest. The Stone Guanyin Nunnery, under a few sparse trees, revealed a stretch of red walls. In the faint morning light, the early morning bell rang a few clear times. Looking out from here, one felt a sense of emptiness in one's heart. Wuxuan and his sister, stepping on the dewdrops on the grass slopes, walked in silence, not mentioning anything important to each other. Menglan stopped at the crossroads and asked, "Brother, are we going to the Reading Platform?" Wuxuan laughed, "It's cool in the morning, why should we go up and down, working up a sweat? There are two clean stones on that Tiger Stone. We can go sit there. I probably have a few things to talk to you about." Menglan hesitated. Although she couldn't figure out what he meant, she didn't dare to refuse and simply followed him. Climbing a few layers of earthen slopes, they reached a flat, rocky area. In the cracks between the broken stones, clusters of short grass grew outwards. The dewdrops on the grass heads were still hanging there, clear and bright, indicating that the night air had not completely dissipated. As a result, when they reached this place, the morning breeze blowing on their bodies was still a bit cool. There wasn't a soul in sight, only birds flying in the sky. Wuxuan stopped and looked at Menglan, saying solemnly, "I didn't bring you here to play. I have something to give you." As he spoke, he reached into his pocket and fumbled for a while, taking out Zhang Guoqi's letter. When Menglan saw the letter, a flush of red immediately spread across her face. Moreover, the letter was already opened. The situation didn't need to be explained in detail. Her heart was pounding like a startled deer, thumping from the inside out. Wuxuan handed the letter directly to her, and she had no choice but to take it. However, her head was already lowered and she couldn't lift it up. (84)</p>

November's chips were calculated to be 7539, totaling 30 bullish companies, 29 bearish companies. The total number of transactions was 2314 in the morning and 1008 in the afternoon.</p>

Types C and B were slightly less by 0.05 yuan in the near term, and the rest uniformly continued rising by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan.

<p>The yarn market is trending firm, with a rampant rising trend. Because existing yarn sales are developing, customers are coming in droves. Factories report a complete lack of existing goods. The stock in the exchange's warehouses is decreasing daily. Selling prices are flying higher and higher, exceeding the standard yarn price by a margin of 5.6 yuan. Therefore, the bearish side is active, and covering is urgently needed. It is said that the amount of yarn in the warehouses has decreased to 12,000-13,000 bales.</p>
<p>The futures yarn market is enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The futures yarn market opened in the morning, with all months rising uniformly. Because yarn sales prices are strong, and existing goods are extremely scarce, each group is particularly eager to buy yarn in the warehouses. Therefore, market sentiment is enthusiastic, and buying pressure is quite strong. October's rose every session, and discovered new peaks after September 29th, reaching 212.1 yuan. The close saw the far-term rising trend slightly moderate. Dafeng, Mingde, Changyu, Wang Taixing, Taichang, Changfeng, Shengyuan, Xincheng etc. uniformly sold off.

<h3 id="e198">Futures Lower Than Spot Prices, Cotton Market Decline Difficult <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but the US and Indian cotton markets are softening. Large players are using coarse cotton to pressure the market this month, and sources from various regions are gradually increasing. Therefore, the cotton market is not as expensive as the yarn market. However, the price of Futures Cotton is several yuan lower than spot cotton, so a decline is practically difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Futures Cotton Rises After a Fall <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The futures cotton market opened with declines due to weakness in US cotton. Trading was suspended for two days, resulting in overall drops. Market sentiment was ordinary, and most speculators were buying yarn and selling cotton. Furthermore, large players were using coarse Russian cotton to exert pressure in the near months, leading to a softer cotton market. Prices for all months fell slightly by a dime. In the second session, yarn sales were reported to be active, factories had constant demand, and prices in various producing areas were not loosening. The third session jumped up by twenty or thirty cents, and closing was flat. Da Fu, Yu Da, Zhen Da, Shen Ji, Wang Tai Xing, and Yuan Yi continued to sell. However, Heng Xing, Ming De, Guang Shuang, Yu Chang, Yuan Yi, Sheng Yuan, Yu Kang, and Tong He and other buyers bought. The result of futures cotton trading was that prices for all months rose by five cents to two dimes compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened with a lively yarn market and high demand for spot cotton from factories, which led short sellers to cover their positions and pushed the market upward. As a result, prices for all months rose by another five cents to one and a half dimes compared to the morning closing price. Sales included: Da Fu: 4,500 dan, Yu Da: 4,500 dan, Zhen Da: 1,500 dan, Tong He: 1,600 dan, Chang He: 1,500 dan, Shen Ji: 5,300 dan, Wang Tai Xing: 2,100 dan, Yuan Yu Yuan: 2,100 dan, Shen Chang: 1,600 dan, Da Chang Cheng: 1,800 dan, Run Kang: 4,500 dan, He Yu: 1,500 dan, Mao Jin Guang Feng: 6,000 zu, Ju Yu: 1,400 dan, Ming De: 1,800 dan, Xing Chang: 2,700 dan, Yuan Yi Er Er: 2,700 dan, Sheng Yuan: 2,900 dan, Fu Kang: 1,900 dan, Xin Chang: 1,800 dan, Da Hui: 1,900 dan, Chang Yu: 2,000 dan, Ren Feng: 5,300 dan. The high and low prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Constant Spot Cotton Demand</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still reasonably good, and factory demand continues unabated. Sources include 2,280 bales of Yao cotton and Tong cotton.</p>

<p>Market conditions were slightly softer last week, with profit-taking by long positions being the primary reason. At the same time, spot prices were weak due to a large increase in inventory. Export news was moderate, with Japan continuing to purchase. Attention was paid to Karachi cotton for import. The mainland market was sluggish. In the Netherlands, transactions were reportedly brisk. Cotton harvest conditions were generally satisfactory, but there was a slight lack of rain. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: thousands of cantons):</p>

<p>As soon as the futures yarn market opened yesterday, spot prices rose, and sluggish yarn sales greatly improved, causing the interdependent cloth market to also soar. After several trading sessions in a day, the result was that compared to last week, white cotton fine cloth and fine twill spot prices rose (per bolt) by one dime, light-weight coarse twill rose (per bolt) by one and a half dimes, heavy-weight rose (per bolt) by more than three dimes, light-weight coarse cloth rose by five cents, and heavy-weight coarse cloth rose by twenty or thirty cents. The prices of finished dyed and printed cloths also rose, by two and a half to three dimes per bolt. Shipments to various ports, especially to the upper reaches of the Sichuan, Guangdong, and Yangtze rivers, were most active. The shortage of various goods is intensifying daily. Even though adding to transactions is still extremely crowded, and market prices are rising sharply, buyers' enthusiasm is not dampened. At the same time, because raw materials such as yarn are so popular, factories are also experiencing fears of raw material shortages, so they have repeatedly raised factory prices. Factory-produced Dong goods, fine cloth, and fine twill, especially the blue cloth and colored twill produced by dyeing factories recently, are selling slowly, so demand is not urgent, and the price increases are also slightly moderate. However, this factory's fine twill and fine cloth are being eagerly sought after by merchants looking for spot goods, so sales are exceptionally strong.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Camel Down Factory Rushing to Produce Winter-Selling Goods, Supply Cannot Keep Up <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Wide and narrow striped, plain-colored camel down is currently selling briskly. Most merchants completed their purchases last month, but those at Weiyi Street are still adding to their orders. Most of the existing stock in the factories has been sold out, so they are now working day and night to rush production, which is quite busy. Those priced around one yuan are selling the fastest. The factory's production is feared to be unable to keep up. In total, in the past few days, transactions of the striped and plain-colored fine and wide camel down have averaged over 5,000 yards per day. We Lun Tiger picture is sold for 2.25 yuan, Tian Xiang Invincible fleece back is sold for 2.45 yuan, Wei Feng Golden Lion is sold for 1 yuan, Zhang Hua Cotton Mou is sold for 1.05 yuan, Jing Lun Moon Rabbit is sold for 1.575 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rarely Fluctuate <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was stable yesterday. The association quoted prices for grades such as No. 24 coarse granulated white, Dong White, and native fine white at original prices. In the Hao market, a Chao merchant offered 86 bags of Zhuang red at 14.8 yuan, and 49 bags of Huanggang Qing at 14 yuan. A Jian merchant, Da Lai, offered over 300 bags of Zhang Diao Qing, with the higher prices at 13.5 yuan, then 13 yuan to 12.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The Joint Company held its first tender this week for Fan-Yue sugar, with a total quota of 9,968 bags. The price remained unchanged. The sales included 275 bags of Shunde Wu Yang coarse white at 21.5 yuan, ten bags of Xinshi sugar at 20.3 yuan, and one thousand bags of Qu Xi Factory sugar at 21.2 yuan. There were no sales.</p>

<p>The price of Quanzhou Pao Yuan has been in a standoff for ten days because the traders and merchants have not been able to agree on a price. Yesterday, they finally came closer to an agreement. Large-size goods fell by 3-4 yuan due to oversupply, while medium-grade goods fell by about 1 yuan. Small-size goods rose slightly by several dimes due to a shortage of goods. A total of over 6,000 boxes were offered, and the market was stable.</p>

<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, the flour market once again showed a sharp rise across all months. Because the market was closed for two days, quotations for foreign wheat from both Chicago and Canada generally rose by about one yuan. Domestically, due to the Sino-Japanese issue, northern grain merchants were united, leading to rising quotations. In Shanghai, people were excited because they saw rising prices abroad and active sales. The opening price jumped by forty or fifty cents, and then rose by another dime as buying interest remained strong. By the time the afternoon session opened, the situation had become more serious. The highest price for the current month reached 3.495 yuan, and the November price also jumped over the 5-yuan mark to 5.175 yuan. The longest-dated month, such as March, even reached 3.64 yuan. These market conditions are the highest new records in the past four or five years. However, after the third session, rumors of the dissolution of a domestic cabinet caused sentiment to soften slightly, and prices fell back by twenty or thirty cents from the highest levels, but were still significantly higher by thirty, forty, or fifty cents compared to before the market closed.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Both Futures and Spot Wheat See Rising Prices -- Flour Sales to the North are Brisk… Concerns that Supplies May Run Out -- <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The futures wheat market rose across all months yesterday morning because foreign wheat prices had risen by about one yuan in the past two days. On the flour sales side, the opening was due to brisk purchases from the North, with inventories already not very high, and future sources of wheat becoming increasingly scarce. All of this has deeply affected the market, so there were no unexpected surges and things remained calm. Otherwise, it would have been difficult to suppress the momentum. Therefore, after opening, prices for each month rose by six, seven, or eight cents. Later, as opinions between buyers and sellers approached, prices stabilized. When the afternoon session opened, prices initially rose again, continuing to be better by three to five cents compared to the morning, and transactions were brisk. Later, as the flour market turned flat, sentiment softened slightly, and the results were generally similar to the morning. The spot wheat market also saw prices rise by five cents because the market price was so high that factories were collectively holding back from buying, so things remained peaceful. Shandong Zizhou wheat was heard to be 5.5 yuan, Yanghe wheat was 5.45 yuan, secondary 5.4 yuan, Bengbu wheat was 5.47 yuan, secondary 5.42 yuan, Jiangbei wheat was 5.28 yuan, secondary 5.25 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was 5.45 yuan, secondary 5.4 yuan, Zhuzhen wheat was 5.35 yuan, and Nanjing Kanming wheat was 5.1 yuan. Fu Xin purchased 15,000 bags, and Shen Da purchased 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e209">River Rice Price Plunge Stimulates Sales <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs were still abundant, with a total of 54 or 55 boats arriving, carrying a total of 1,300 or 1,400 shi. However, sales in this street were scarce. Only the Bao Wei, Qing Yan, Dalian, and other gangs purchased nearly 1,000 bags of Yaozhong Baige and over 300 bags of Bo Po. The Wen Tianjin Gang purchased 1,500 bags of Hou Xin Geng. Therefore, market conditions were difficult to maintain and continued to be weak. Yaozhong Baige prices fell by one or two dimes, and Hou Xin Geng plummeted by half a yuan. Du Yang and other varieties of Xin Jian also fell by one or two dimes, and Bo Po Geng also depreciated by one or two dimes. Only Xin Yin Yuan, because the arrival of goods was not large, remained unchanged. However, observing the afternoon market situation, sentiment seemed to be active after the sharp decline. If the source of goods is not strong, there may be a temporary hope of stability.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 43 or 44 boats arrived from various routes in the river. Sales of various goods in the market were slightly active for Po Geng and Xin Geng, and the remaining goods were flat. The market situation was that high-grade Po Geng rose slightly by a dime, while medium- and lower-grade fell by one or two dimes. Xin Geng continued to fall by two, three, or four dimes. Xin Yang, Du Jian, Xin Chen, and Bian Yuan followed with declines of one or two dimes. Yao Zhong, Bu Jian, and Ke Jian prices did not fluctuate much.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market was quite active. Because trading on the National Day and Sunday was slow, both the North and South gangs went to the market to buy rice yesterday. Although arrivals have been brisk for several days and inventories are also sufficient, the market was lively and strong. Guangdong merchants had the best sales. In addition to brown rice, milled rice from various routes was also purchased in whole batches. Northern merchants also had strong demand. Shantou merchants also continued to inquire. It is estimated that 6,600 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,300 bags of Xiang rice, 300 bags of Taiwanese Xian rice, 200 bags of Han Xi rice, and 1,000 bags of Jiaxing Zao Jian were sold throughout the day.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Sesame Demand Exceeds Supply, Market Prices Rise Sharply by Fifty or Sixty Cents <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The sesame market has changed greatly during the two days of market closure. Spot raw sesame is sold as soon as it arrives, with no accumulation, so market sentiment is very tight. Prices have risen sharply by fifty or sixty cents in two days. (Yesterday, over one hundred bags of various sesames were opened.) As a result, very few foreign merchants were willing to sell clean goods. Prices rose from 12.05 yuan to 12.45 yuan yesterday, with a total of 200 tons traded, all by merchants covering short positions. Therefore, both raw and clean goods are strong in the market. Soybean sales are strong, and oil mills have a strong appetite. The price of high-grade Che Lun beans has increased by three or four cents. There are also few Sha Huang beans available, and Fuzhou manufacturers in this street are jointly purchasing Yun beans and Zha beans, so they are uniquely priced higher by six or seven cents. A total of over 6,900 bags of various new beans were traded yesterday.</p>

<p>The domestic and foreign silk markets are both feeling sluggish, with small silk price fluctuations and even weaker raw silk sales. There was no market in New York yesterday, and Yokohama silk prices fell slightly by one or two yuan compared to the end of last week. Shanghai White foreign merchants are quiet, and only sporadic sales of Ji Li silk and other varieties are being made. Selling pressure has not increased, and sales of silk to users are declining, so the market has not escaped its slump. Market prices have fallen by about five yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchant green tea market was still depressed. Merchants from England and France are still reluctant to act because overseas prices are too low. It is also heard that the Moroccan market has recently seen a large influx of Japanese tea being dumped, causing sales of low-grade Chinese tea to be very slow.

<h3 id="e215">Modern Diseases of Young Men and Women: Heading Towards Depravity and Destruction! <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>One of the most frustrating things for young people in adolescence is the occurrence of sexual urges, and the inability to resolve them. Without proper sexual behavior as a solution, worries, disappointments, frustrations, and anxieties arise, leading to unhealthy self-pleasuring (masturbation) or abnormal homosexual love. In short, these are all pathological sexual behaviors. Under such circumstances, "neurasthenia" and reproductive dysfunction occur one after another, becoming the most common modern diseases in modern society.</p>
<p>These diseases are not only the biggest reason for harming the health of young men and women, but also the root cause of national decline. Look at how the youth of other countries view the nation. For example, the National Socialist Youth League of Germany has exerted the greatest power. In addition, there are the Italian Fascist Party and the Japanese military, which are mostly ambitious young people. But what about the youth of China? Under the worries and frustrations of sex, they dejectedly head towards depravity and destruction. How can China be rejuvenated this way?</p>
<p>Most young men and women who engage in masturbation have symptoms of neurasthenia, such as memory loss, dullness and lifelessness, depression and pessimism, headaches, dizziness, insomnia, and a lack of patience, fatigue, and boredom when working or studying. They also lack courage, have weak lower back and legs, back pain, digestive disorders, and become thin and emaciated with a haggard appearance. In addition, they also have reproductive dysfunction—such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, small penis, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation in men, and frigidity, anorgasmia, menstrual irregularities, and incomplete development of the uterus and ovaries in women. These are all the results of masturbation and affect future sexual life, creating various tragedies between families. They lose the happiness of life, lose the light of the future, lose the courage to fight, and there is no greater worry or frustration than this!</p>
<p>Here I want to guide you that the treatment of neurasthenia and reproductive dysfunction is not very difficult. Today, I will write down some of the information and experiences of European and American experts for patients to use as a guide to self-treatment. For neurasthenia, whether male or female, those with symptoms such as heaviness in the head, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, sluggish thinking, and mental depression should take "Memory Neurotic" to nourish their nerves and quickly eliminate symptoms and restore health. On the other hand, if there is reproductive dysfunction, such as incomplete sexual organ development, impotence, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, or kidney deficiency in men, they should take the testicle gland preparation "Well Tonic" to strengthen the essence and replenish the kidneys. For women with frigidity, decreased libido, menstrual irregularities, leukorrhea, dysmenorrhea, or weakness, they should take the ovary gland preparation "Menorrin" to regulate menstruation and maintain health. These three medicines are effective, safe, and harmless oral medications for home treatment. If patients use them appropriately, the above-mentioned symptoms can be quickly cured. Young men and women who are worried in the darkness of life! May you walk towards the bright road, save the country from danger, pull yourselves out of decline, and wake up! This is the way for you to eliminate weakness and strive for strength!</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Shortcut to Reducing Fever and Curing Lung Disease <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Bale (Written), Fang Shi Tong (Translated)</p>
<p>If the body temperature of a person with tuberculosis is above 37 degrees Celsius, it indicates that the affected area has not yet formed a complete defensive barrier. Regardless of the severity of the disease, it is a sign of progression. The quickest way to cure lung disease is to stop the disease by reducing the fever, which is the most urgent task. There is no way to cure the disease completely without stopping its progression. It is also difficult to stop the disease if the body temperature does not return to normal. Therefore, the first step in treating lung disease is to achieve a fever-free state as soon as possible, which is the fundamental strategy for treatment.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate for patients with fever to indiscriminately take chemical drugs internally in an attempt to quickly reduce the fever, as these antipyretics are powerful in nature, have significant side effects, and their antipyretic effect is temporary and unnatural. Patients often experience other unpleasant side effects from using these strong antipyretics, which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The most reasonable and fundamental treatment for fever in lung disease is to take "Phith Weal" internally, according to the experimental reports of lung disease sanatoriums in various countries. Because the ingredients of this product are made from hormones (also known as endocrine glands) extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of healthy animals, its efficacy produces specific immune substances in the body, increases resistance to toxins, and inhibits the secretion of tubercle toxins, neutralizing toxins in the body (resulting in detoxification) and restoring the temperature-regulating center to normal. Its natural antipyretic effect and safety are indeed beyond the reach of chemical drugs.</p>
<p>When the hormones (endocrine glands) in "Phith Weal" are taken into the body, their greatest effect is to invigorate the physiological function of the lungs and increase the lung capacity, reviving weakened tissues. The regenerative function can increase connective tissue cells, surrounding the affected area and building a fortress-like barrier around it, confining the activity of tubercle bacilli and preventing the spread of lesions to other parts. The bacilli will eventually be defeated and eliminated, and the affected area will harden and form scars, naturally entering a state of complete cure. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that "Phith Weal" is the most reasonable and effective internal medicine for radically curing lung disease in modern times.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Menstruation and Health and Beauty <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Xiuzhen</p>
<p>Menstruation has a close relationship with women's diseases. A little carelessness can induce various diseases, leading to overall weakness and hindering health and beauty. However, due to the long-standing habit of self-isolation in our country for thousands of years, women are reluctant to seek medical treatment, missing the opportunity for treatment, thus losing reproductive function, failing to fulfill the responsibilities of women, reducing a lot of happiness in life, or even losing the most precious life, which is regrettable. Common diseases of the reproductive organs include amenorrhea, excessive or insufficient menstruation, irregular periods, dysmenorrhea, menstrual abdominal pain, uterine inflammation, and leukorrhea. Investigation of the causes of the disease generally shows that most are caused by physical weakness. Therefore, the treatment method must be to take a menstruation-regulating and blood-nourishing agent to regain health.</p>
<p>Among menstruation-regulating and blood-nourishing agents, "Menorrin" is the most effective. Those suffering from menstrual irregularities can have them corrected, those who have been married for a long time without pregnancy can become pregnant, those who are physically tired can regain energy, and the various diseases caused by menstrual disorders can be relieved, and those who are thin can become plump. It is indeed a holy medicine for relieving women's suffering and a source for maintaining health and beauty. I dare to recommend it, hoping that my female compatriots will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Experimental Report on the Radical Cure of Asthma <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Kaller, M.D. (Described), Dr. Shen Zhaoquan (Translated from the German Lung Disease Weekly)</p>
<p>Asthma treatment was previously considered a difficult-to-cure disease because there were no perfect medicines. Even we clinical physicians felt it was thorny. At the time of an attack, we could only temporarily relieve the pain with anesthetics (morphine, opium). It was generally difficult and hopeless to cure it without recurrence. However, these anesthetics should not be used frequently for fear of causing poisoning. Asthma medicines sold in the market contain anesthetics, which can take effect immediately, but if they are used every time an attack occurs, they often lead to addiction. If patients buy and take this type of asthma medicine containing toxic substances, not only will they not be cured radically, but they will often suffer great harm from poisoning. Shouldn't they be careful?</p>
<p>Dr. Humbert M.D., based on many years of experience and the latest scientific theories, invented an asthma-radical cure medicine using the endocrine secretions of healthy animals. Its name is "Holipin," an oral tablet that does not contain any toxic substances. Although it is very effective, it has no side effects. It specializes in treating all kinds of asthma and dyspnea in the elderly and children. It has been recommended and adopted by physicians from all over the world. In recent years, I have treated no less than 300 cases of asthma and have achieved radical cures in 95% of cases by administering "Holipin." I have extracted two recently cured cases from my consultations on the left for the reference of my colleagues and those suffering from the same disease.</p>
<p>First Case: Mr. So-and-so, 49 years old</p>
<p>(History) Normal physique. Suffered from coughing for three years. Coughing was especially severe in winter (commonly known as cold cough). Asthma developed in the autumn of the 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(Symptoms) Usually, he only felt slightly uncomfortable breathing, but when an attack occurred, he felt very difficult, and was unusually distressed. He could not lie down flat, his lips and face were cyanotic, he was drenched in cold sweat, and the appearance of the illness was so torturous that it cannot be described in words. Moreover, the attacks mostly occurred in the middle of the night and required several hours to cough up thick phlegm before gradually easing and returning to normal. The attacks occurred once or twice a month. The attacks were more severe during holidays. He had taken many kinds of Western medicines without being cured radically.</p>
<p>(Diagnosis) Bronchial Asthma</p>
<p>(Treatment and Health Maintenance) Often went for walks in the wilderness to breathe fresh air, but took care not to catch a cold. The room was improved to make the air flow easily and to provide sufficient sunlight. He ate more nutritious foods. He refrained from using irritating substances such as tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>For medical treatment, he was instructed to take "Holipin" and to take three tablets at a time during an attack. The shortness of breath was usually relieved within ten minutes, the phlegm was thinner, and the breathing was smoother. He also continued to take it internally during intermittent periods, three times a day, two tablets each time. In addition, he also took the lung-strengthening agent "Phith Weal" internally at the same time, three times a day, one tablespoon each time. After a total of fifteen weeks of medication, the long-term cough and asthma were completely cured. It has been eight months since then, and he has not had an attack.</p>
<p>(History) Weak body (adenoid). Since the age of four, after suffering from measles, he had been coughing continuously. By the age of nine, he developed asthma.</p>
<p>(Symptoms) Coughing, phlegm, difficulty breathing. Coughing was more frequent at night and in the morning. Asthma occurred when the climate changed suddenly. He first felt a headache, his face was pale, and he had a look of distress. Breathing was extremely difficult and required great effort, and was prolonged and wheezing. His abdominal muscles were tense like a board. It was quite difficult to cough up phlegm. It took one or two weeks for each severe attack to subside and gradually return to normal. He had taken medicine and injections, but was not cured radically.</p>
<p>(Diagnosis) Bronchial Asthma with Tuberculosis in the Left Lung Apex</p>
<p>(Asthma and Lung Disease)</p>
<p>(Treatment) Strict adherence to methods of care regarding air, sunlight, quiet, and nutrition. He was instructed to take the asthma-specific drug "Holipin" and the lung disease-specific drug "Phith Weal" at the same time. After about nine weeks of medication, the asthma was cured and the lung disease was 70% cured. Therefore, he continued to take "Phith Weal" alone for more than a month. After an examination, he was also found to be completely cured and his body was as strong as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Debilitating Spermatorrhea <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Shitong</p>
<p>The Messrs. Xi Fu and Cui said, "One drop of seminal fluid is superior to forty drops of blood." They also said that unnatural lust causes the external release of seminal fluid, which has two drawbacks: one, it depletes the nourishing elements in the blood, and two, it wastes the vitality of the nerves. From this, we know that the excessive waste of seminal fluid is to be dreaded.</p>
<p>Moreover, seminal fluid is not only the source of physical strength but also the source of intellectual power. Dr. Hall said that the secretions of a young man's testicles—seminal fluid—are sent from the blood to the heart and then from the heart to the arteries. When it irrigates the muscle tissue, it strengthens the muscles; when it irrigates the brain, it clarifies thoughts, improves judgment, and strengthens willpower. Therefore, students suffering from spermatorrhea often have poor grades. What else could explain this if not the connection between seminal fluid and intelligence?</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is a disease commonly seen in young men, referring to the unconscious and natural leakage of seminal fluid. The patient experiences ejaculation several times a week without erection or pleasure, or several times a night. The next day, they feel exhausted, with weakened limbs, dizziness, and depression. In severe cases, they may even ejaculate occasionally in broad daylight. This is a very serious condition called spermatorrhea (also known as "leaking sperm"), especially exacerbated during urination and defecation.</p>
<p>There are many causes of spermatorrhea and seminal emission. The most common are masturbation and excessive or incomplete sexual intercourse. Furthermore, obscene conversations, pornographic books, pictures, and plays can also trigger this condition. If the patient does not seek appropriate treatment, it can endanger life and lead to infertility. On a small scale, it destroys an individual's lifelong happiness; on a large scale, it becomes the source of national weakness and racial extinction. Therefore, patients must seek urgent treatment.</p>
<p>According to our clinical trials, 'Fonan Tablets' are the safest treatment. This product is made with ingredients that fortify the essence and replenish the kidneys. It is a tonic and strengthening medicine without any toxicity. It has a remarkable effect on treating spermatorrhea, seminal emission, and sperm leakage. Even with prolonged use, it will definitely not cause any harm. This is what clinical physicians in various countries have praised, considering it the safest and most effective medicine for treating this condition.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Common Sense for Economical Treatment of Lung Disease <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>If the economic situation of a person with lung disease does not pose a problem, they should go to a specialist physician as soon as possible to implement scientific treatments, as this is the best course of action. However, choosing a doctor is most likely to lead one astray. The patient wanting to entrust their life to a physician should consider whether the doctor's ethics are high, and whether the fees are affordable for the poor or only for the wealthy. These are all common-sense considerations for patients choosing a doctor and are prerequisites for economical treatment of lung disease.</p>
<p>If the patient lives in a remote rural area and lacks access to specialist physicians, or if they are limited by their finances and cannot afford to see a doctor, they can still achieve recovery by resting at home. The patient must know that this disease requires long-term rest. Having a plan to support long-term care is the wisest approach.</p>
<p>Those who rest at home only need to follow natural therapies such as fresh air, nutrition, and rest, along with taking effective and appropriate lung-healing medications internally. According to reports from European and American experts, the internal administration of the latest organ preparation 'Phith Weal' is quite effective. The symptoms of stages one and two of lung disease, such as bloody sputum, coughing, shortness of breath, night sweats, and tidal fever, will gradually subside after taking this product. If combined with hygiene and health preservation methods, recovery can generally be achieved in three or four months. This treatment does not require much expense and is easy for the poor to implement. Therefore, many can achieve a full cure. It is indeed the most effective strategy for economical treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The Issue of Blood Transfusions <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Recently, a certain hospital in Shanghai organized a blood transfusion team to handle blood purchase matters, which has attracted social attention. A certain lawyer once submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to interpret whether this matter constitutes a crime. The reasons he holds are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Blood is an essential element of life. The person from whom blood is drawn risks death from blood loss, while the patient themselves gains no real benefit.</p>
<p>(2) Although the blood donation is voluntary on the part of the injured person, voluntarily injuring oneself is no different from suicide. If instigating or helping another person commit suicide is a crime, then instigating and helping another person injure themselves should also be a crime.</p>
<p>(3) Drawing the blood of the poor to benefit the rich, making the rich stronger and the poor weaker, and the rich live while the poor die, is truly intolerable by the law.</p>
<p>Regarding the lawyer's suggestion, we believe that the first and second points are open to discussion. Blood transfusion is one of the scientific therapies and holds a significant position in medicine. In terms of its effectiveness, it can indeed bring the dying back to life. The lawyer's statement that it offers "no real benefit" is simply unfounded. As for the donor, because the amount drawn is not excessive, the loss suffered is also limited. With a little rest, they can recover. It will definitely not lead to "death from blood loss" as the lawyer said. Blood transfusion therapy is a method of supplementing the deficient with the surplus. It certainly has its value.</p>
<p>The second point raised by the lawyer is the issue of injury. He believes that although the person from whom blood is drawn voluntarily injures themselves, the practitioner is guilty of instigating or helping another person voluntarily injure themselves. In my opinion, this reason is difficult to establish. Regardless of whether the phrase "instigating and helping another person voluntarily injure themselves" is explicitly stated in the law, even if it is considered to fully align with the principles of legislation, the law clearly states that "justifiable acts are not punishable." This can be interpreted as professionals exercising the rights that fall within their professional scope. A doctor, by virtue of their profession, has the right to use anesthetics and perform amputations within the scope of medicine at any time. Because this is a justifiable act, it cannot be considered injury. Blood transfusion is a scientific therapy and is, of course, a justifiable act. Moreover, the blood donation is voluntary and not instigated by the doctor. Furthermore, the donor can recover with a little rest after the blood donation, and there is no great danger. There is even less reason to speak of injury!</p>
<p>The third point raised by the lawyer has some valid reasons. Drawing the blood of the poor to benefit the rich is, in any case, inhumane. If the doctor profits from this, collecting blood at extremely low prices and transfusing it to others at the highest price, earning a significant profit in the process, this behavior is worse than that of human traffickers and greedy officials who exploit the people.</p>
<p>The lawyer's suggestions have been stated above. Now, I will briefly state my suggestions regarding this issue:</p>
<p>(1) The Human Issue: Although blood transfusion is not a criminal act, buying and selling blood and drawing the blood of the poor to inject into the rich is indeed the most inhumane thing. It must be understood that the fundamental condition of this issue is that the donor is not induced by money but is entirely motivated by compassion. Among humans, those most full of compassion are religious figures! Chinese monks and nuns, and foreign male and female clergy, are all compassionate and willing to sacrifice themselves to save the world. Let us look at their religious leaders, the Buddha who fed himself to a tiger, and Jesus who was nailed to the cross. Their great spirit of sacrifice is truly worthy of emulation by religious people. Therefore, I hope that the religious people of the world, based on compassion, will automatically unite to organize a blood transfusion organization to provide blood to anemic patients. The ancients said, "Cutting one's arm to heal a parent" is driven by filial piety. Transfusing blood to save people is driven by compassion. Moreover, most religions advocate celibacy, free from the disturbances of desire, and their blood is even cleaner. Religious people of the world! Instead of chanting scriptures, worshiping Buddha, or praying to God, why not each donate a drop of blood to do this good deed that is truly beneficial to humanity?</p>
<p>(2) The Use of Blood Transfusions: Blood transfusions are even more important during wartime. When war begins, those soldiers who fight for the country and the nation shed their own blood in large quantities to win glory for the country and the nation. They are injured! They bleed! Doctors use surgical clamps to stop their blood vessels and stop the bleeding, but some eventually lose their lives due to excessive blood loss. At this time, how should the people in the rear do their best to supply these wounded heroes? Material supply is certainly important, but is it not more valuable to use their own blood to supply them, voluntarily sending it to doctors for extraction, so that these bleeding soldiers can receive blood supplementation and easily recover their health, returning to the battlefield to kill the enemy? Soldiers who kill the enemy on the front lines are directly shedding blood, while those in the rear who transfuse blood are indirectly shedding blood. Both are national heroes and have contributed to the country.</p>
<p>In short, blood transfusion itself is neither good nor evil. It is the motive and the object that determines good and evil. The motive should not be money, and the object should not be class. Instead, the motive should be compassion and loyalty, and the object should be humanity and the country.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Investigation Report on the Sanitary Conditions of Xiashi, Zhejiang (4) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>(B) Relief Center Clinic</p>
<p>Every summer, the well-known local philanthropist Shen Xinquan initiates and contacts the Chinese Medicine Association to manage the affairs. The clinic provides consultations and medicine (Chinese medicine). The doctors are all Chinese medicine practitioners. Although the scope is not large, it is impossible to collect statistics. Therefore, the achievements cannot be reported to the readers.</p>
<p>(C) Clinic Attached to the Hospital</p>
<p>Every time seasonal diseases are about to appear, the hospitals become busy with vaccinations or preventive injections. The poor and sick are completely free of charge. In the midst of this decline in rural areas, it is no small contribution to benefit the people.</p>
<p>(XIII) Medical Conditions</p>
<p>(A) Hospitals</p>
<p>The more famous one is Shengsheng Hospital, headed by Xia Canglin. His knowledge and experience are both very rich. The hospital is divided into internal medicine, surgery, venereal diseases, dermatology, pediatrics, and other departments, and has an attached pharmacy. There are three physicians and five assistant physicians. The consultation fee for outpatient visits is one yuan, house calls are two yuan and twenty cents, and urgent calls are four yuan and forty cents. The poor and sick are free of charge. Although there are only about ten beds, it is already a rare occurrence in Xiashi.</p>
<p>Fuen Hospital is located on Nan Temple Street, headed by Chen Jimin. It is an American and British church hospital, completely charitable in nature, so the clinic business is very developed, and it benefits the common people greatly.</p>
<p>Lisheng Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital—Obstetrics in Xiashi has always been in a dark age. There was no dedicated obstetrics department. People with knowledge of childbirth all went to famous large-scale hospitals in Jiaxing or Shanghai and Hangzhou. Those without knowledge all hired midwives to deliver the babies, so the risk was very high. "A pregnant woman has one foot in the coffin" has become a common saying in Xiashi. It is clear how unfavorable midwives are to pregnant women. Since Ms. Wu Feiru founded Lisheng, the atmosphere has changed completely. The ignorant have gradually been able to enjoy the benefits of science. This is something to be gratified about.</p>
<p>Hongkang Hospital, headed by Qian Shunhe, is experienced. Physician Zai Baiping has considerable skills in major surgical operations. The internal equipment is fairly complete. There are six or seven other hospitals of various sizes. The heads of the hospitals are either nurses or interns. None are officially trained, and the equipment is often imperfect. According to the hospital qualifications stipulated by the Ministry of Interior's Health Department, they do not fully comply, so there is no value in writing about them here, so as not to waste valuable space.</p>
<p>(B) Medical Offices</p>
<p>Medical offices refer specifically to Chinese medicine practitioners. The famous Confucian doctors here are Jiang Yinchun and Zhang Wuqiao. Famous doctors include: Wang Hebo and Yu Ziying for internal medicine, Zhong Weixin and Yue Wenqing for surgery, Hu Xiansheng for pediatrics, Ping Jianchen for throat medicine, Zhou Ziqin for acupuncture, Wu Xinxia for mental illness, Yang Shifu for trauma, and Zhou Yanlin for dentistry. Each has set up a medical office in their residence. The number of outpatient visits ranges from about ten to dozens per day. House calls are made by sedan. Since the decline of rural areas, it is said that they have all been affected, and clinic businesses are only about 30-40% of what they used to be.</p>
<p>(C) Pharmacies</p>
<p>There are only three pharmacies in the town: Huamei, whose business is not very developed and whose scope is small. Asia is larger in scale. The owner, Li Guoxi, is shrewd and capable and has served as an English professor at the Shanghai YMCA. Since its establishment, the annual surplus capital has grown from several hundred yuan to more than ten thousand. The Sino-French Pharmacy on North Main Street is also owned by him. The scope of business is such that it can be said that there are absolutely no patients who go to fill prescriptions because they are all filled in hospitals, so it specializes in being used by doctors in nearby small towns and purchased by the public. The local hospital only uses them temporarily for foot care.</p>
<p>(D) Chinese Medicine Stores</p>
<p>There are only three Chinese medicine stores here: Guangsheng, Jiudayong, and Wanyuan. Wu Caizhi just expanded this year, but its scope is not as large as Guangsheng's. The famous medicine store is Changshengtang, which is highly praised. The others are Tongrentang, Tianyuantang, Tianshengtang, and dozens of others. Recently, they have been hit by the decline in doctors' clinic businesses and the rural economic panic, and they are all declining daily.</p>
<p>(E) Quacks</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to find itinerant doctors wandering around this town, specializing in defrauding people for money, and even posing as scientific doctors. This has caused considerable resistance to the progress of scientific medicine!</p>
<p>(XIV) Health Administration Agencies</p>
<p>Xiashi Town has no dedicated health administration agency. There is only a health section attached to the Public Security Bureau. The health police are concurrently held by intelligent police officers, and there are only a few cleaners. Therefore, the health administration of Xiashi has not been able to fully develop!</p>
<p>(B) Medical Education</p>
<p>(1) School and Health Conditions</p>
<p>The county-run Xiashi Elementary School is located at the foot of Mount Shen. It is the highest institution of learning in the town and is the crystallization of Shen Guoying's meticulous management and painstaking efforts. The number of students has grown from dozens to more than three hundred. The teachers are all normal school graduates, and the education is very effective. Everyone in Xiashi praises him for his contributions to his hometown. Mr. Shen finally suffered from overwork. Unfortunately, his mental strength greatly deteriorated, and he was unable to continue running it. Therefore, he had resigned several times before being approved. All parties heard the news and repeatedly tried to persuade him to stay, but to no avail. The author speculates that the nonpayment of teaching salaries was probably his greatest stimulus. He once sold his ancestral home and used the proceeds to fully supplement the school's expenses, willingly going hungry himself. Such a Mr. Shen is truly a rare and enthusiastic educator!</p>
<p>Anyone who has visited Xiashi Elementary School knows that Xiashi Elementary School has no formal buildings that can be used as classrooms because the school buildings are all renovated temples. The light is very good because it is at the foot of the mountain, and the air is naturally fresh, which meets health needs. About two or thirty students live at the school. The water for the entire school is supplied by wells, and drinking water is taken from the river and purified using alum sedimentation. According to the school staff, students are forced to be vaccinated against smallpox every spring, and health checks are conducted at the beginning of the school year in the fall. When epidemics are prevalent, preventive injections are given to the entire school.</p>
<p>Mi Elementary School is a private senior elementary school founded by the Xiashi Rice Industry Association. The funding is relatively sufficient, and the school building is a newly built Western-style house. Therefore, the lighting and ventilation are very hygienic. However, the sports field is very small because there is no suitable open space nearby.</p>
<p>Zivei Elementary School, located in Cangji, is a senior elementary school for girls. The school affairs are also very developed. The principal, Wu Mulan, is also a top student from Hangzhou First Normal School. There are no shortcomings in terms of sanitary equipment. There are several other schools, including Yadong and Zhenkun. The school buildings are very small, but the sanitary equipment can also be described as complete. Although the funding is extremely difficult, they do not fail to pay attention to hygiene because of this. This is the preciousness of the educated class!</p>

<h3 id="e223">On Rickettsia and Rickettsial Diseases (3) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Duanbai</p>
<p>(III) Bacteriological Aspects</p>
<p>Although the biological classification of Rickettsia is not yet very clear, the fact that it belongs to the bacteria family, or something similar to bacteria, (Schizomyceten, commonly known as bacteria) can be determined based on its reproductive method (constriction and transverse division). However, it is difficult to find it living inside cells (Cytotrop) in the blood of patients and animals. Conversely, it is easy to demonstrate in the digestive tract of vectors and animal tissues, such as the testicles and Descemet's membrane cells, (Descemet Membran &amp; Hodenzellen) during a considerable period. This is one of the distinctive features of Rickettsia. It cannot be successfully cultured using ordinary or special media. Only tissue culture can be used, Gewebeskultur Tissue Culture. This is the second distinctive feature of Rickettsia. Its size is generally 0.3 to 0.5 U, 0.3-0.5粁 (thousandth of a mm). Among all known bacteria, none is smaller than it. This is the third distinctive feature of Rickettsia. Rickettsia is non-filterable. It cannot pass through the Berkeleld &amp; Chamberland filter. Its body is spherical, slightly elliptical, and consistently arranged in streptococcus-like shapes, with transverse bands in the middle to connect them. Among the various pigment sensitivities, Giemsa staining is the most suitable. After staining, it appears deep purple, spherical or rod-shaped, with the transverse band appearing light blue. The outlines of each Rickettsia are rarely clear. During the degeneration period of Rickettsia, its ability to receive pigments also decreases, often being blurred and light, making it difficult to distinguish from cell granules. When Rickettsia proliferates, it can be in the form of thin filaments or staphylococcus-like clusters. Its ability to proliferate in the human body is not as strong as its proliferation in arthropods and other animals such as rabbits. The fact that it proliferates outside cells has not yet been confirmed. Animal inoculation is most convenient with rabbit testicles and the anterior chamber of the eye. For clinical research, the Macacus Fascafus Japanese monkey is the most suitable.</p>
<p>(IV) Types and Geographic Distribution of Rickettsial Diseases</p>
<p>As far as we know now, there are various rickettsial diseases:</p>
<p>(1) Typhus Fever (Flecktypbus)</p>
<p>(2) Trench Fever (Febris Wolhynica)</p>
<p>(3) Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever</p>
<p>(4) Tsutsugamushi Fever (Tautsugamusi Fieber)</p>
<p>Others such as Tabardillo, Brill Disease, Mauchu TyplivsGndiwisch Flloklieber, Mexican typhus fever, and Manchurian typhus fever, as well as endemic typhus fever, are all friends in the typhus fever family.</p>
<p>In terms of its geographic area, countries in Southeastern Europe, such as Romania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the border between Poland and Russia, North America, Eastern Asia, Southern China, and Japan, Taiwan, and the South Sea Islands all have traces of Rickettsia. The history of its development certainly goes back more than twenty years, it's just that its details were not known before and it was confused with other suspected diseases.</p>
<p>(V) Pathological Aspects</p>
<p>When Rickettsia invades the human body, the first step is the skin. The changes it causes are perivascular infiltration, especially in the capillaries Perirasuclare Infiltration. Lymphatic vessels are also equally affected. As the situation progresses, this change can reach the subcutaneous tissue. Japanese Tsutsugamushi disease researcher and pathologist Rin Kawamura also studied the cortical pathology and biological changes of Tsutsugamushi disease Rickettsia. According to him, Rickettsia grows in mononuclear cells Histiocyt from the third to the eighth or ninth day after infection, which is the proliferation period. After reaching its peak, it gradually degenerates and decreases. After the ninth day, its morphology is incomplete within two or three days, its number is greatly reduced, and it eventually disappears completely. When studying skin allergic reactions (Tsutsugamushi disease), as a necessary stage of the preliminary work, the author also conducted an experiment. The results were completely consistent with Kawamura's report. The pathological tissue changes caused by Rickettsia reproduction are (1) perivascular inflammation, (2) infiltration, (3) degeneration, and (4) necrosis. The blood vessels undergo extreme dilation, and the phenomenon caused by this is, of course, the slowing of blood flow and the exudation of blood due to the weakening of the blood vessel walls. The changes in the skin throughout are only two weeks. The recovery situation is the reduction of infiltration, the contraction of blood vessels, and a gradual return to the pre-disease state, without leaving any scars. The pathological changes caused by Rickettsia in other organs are nothing more than perivascular inflammation and the associated or subsequent phenomena.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(93) Acute Gastric Mucositis (Gastritis Acuta)</p>
<p>(Q) What is acute gastric mucositis?</p>
<p>(A) This is one of the most common diseases of the stomach, which is an acute inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Doctors commonly call it acute gastric catarrh.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the main cause of this disease?</p>
<p>(A) The main causes of acute gastric mucositis are overeating, indiscriminately eating food that is too cold or too hot or spoiled, and not chewing food sufficiently when eating.</p>
<p>(Q) Besides these causes, what else can cause acute inflammation of the gastric mucosa?</p>
<p>(A) Accidentally swallowing corrosive substances such as acids, alkalis, carbolic acid, mercuric chloride, phosphorus, and arsenic can also cause acute gastric mucositis. Also, people with acute febrile diseases, anemia, and weakness often develop this disease concurrently.</p>
<p>(Q) What digestive symptoms do patients with acute gastric mucositis experience?</p>
<p>(A) The main symptoms are indigestion, which includes loss of appetite, pressure in the stomach, aversion to eating, thirst, nausea, vomiting, noisy stomach, and belching.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms appear in the patient's mouth?</p>
<p>(A) A thick coating on the tongue, a sticky taste, bad breath, and herpes labialis.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the abnormalities in the stool and urine?</p>
<p>(A) The stool tends to be constipated, and the amount of urine is less than usual.</p>
<p>(Q) Does the patient's body have a fever?</p>
<p>(A) There is usually a moderate fever, around 38 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>(Q) Are gastric function and secretion affected?</p>
<p>(A) After suffering from acute gastric mucositis, gastric function naturally declines, secretion also decreases, and the amount of free hydrochloric acid also decreases.</p>
<p>(Q) How is acute gastric mucositis diagnosed?</p>
<p>(A) If the patient has a fever, it can easily be confused with typhoid fever. It should be differentiated by the presence or absence of splenomegaly and rose spots.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for acute gastric mucositis?</p>
<p>(A) The first thing is to remove the accumulated contents in the stomach, which is to make the patient vomit or perform gastric lavage; if that is not possible, then inject "apomorphine" to induce vomiting. If it is too late, and it is suspected that it has reached the intestines, then a laxative should be administered.</p>
<p>(Q) What kind of food should the patient eat?</p>
<p>(A) First, abstain from food for one or two days, only drinking things like malt soup and kudzu root soup. Afterwards, eat some rice porridge, fish, eggs, meat juice, and potatoes in small amounts, gradually moving on to ordinary food.</p>
<p>(Q) What should be done about stomach pain and vomiting?</p>
<p>(A) At this time, warmth can be applied to the upper abdomen, or an anesthetic can be taken internally. When thirsty, drink some soda or cold drinks.</p>
<p>(Q) When the illness has recovered, how should medicine be used?</p>
<p>(A) During the recovery period, a stomachic can be administered to stimulate appetite.</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(103) Otitic Meningitis</p>
<p>There are many types of meningitis. What people generally refer to as meningitis is epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. It is incorrect to assume that meningitis only refers to this one type. According to the different types of meningitis, besides epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, there are also tuberculous meningitis, serous meningitis, and many other distinctions. These fall under the scope of internal medicine and will not be discussed here. What I want to talk about now is otitic meningitis.</p>
<p>The occurrence of otitic meningitis generally cannot escape three pathways: First, it originates from otitis media or mastoiditis. Second, it originates from otitis media combined with suppurative labyrinthitis. Third, it originates from inner ear inflammation and other complications. Because the cause originates in the ear, it is called otitic meningitis. Otitic meningitis generally occurs more frequently in children. If it is caused by chronic otitis media, children around ten years old are most susceptible. It is rarely seen in adults. However, the bone of the mastoid process in young children is very thin, so when young children develop mastoiditis, one must be careful to prevent the occurrence of otitic meningitis.</p>
<p>The transmission route of otitic meningitis has been roughly described above. Its pathogens should also be deeply understood. According to the opinions of general scholars, although staphylococcus, diplococcus, etc., can all cause this disease, hemolytic streptococcus is the most common.</p>
<p>The clinical symptoms and course of otitic meningitis often vary and differ from those of general meningitis. Generally speaking, it starts with an ear disease, followed by a disease of the intracranial meninges. To put it more plainly, the ear disease is its primary disease, and the meningeal disease is its secondary disease. It does not have the prodromal symptoms of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, such as chills, fever, vomiting, fatigue, headache, and sacral pain. However, if it is caused by acute otitis media, it can be the same as epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, even with insomnia, restlessness, severe hearing impairment, and constant nausea. The common symptom of general otitis media is that the higher the body temperature, the more severe the clouding of consciousness, nuchal rigidity, hyperactive tendon reflexes, and gradually Kernig's sign also appears. The feet twitch, and the pupils also change, just like general epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. Often, those caused by streptococcus do not have severe prodromal symptoms; there may be no digestive symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, only systemic discomfort like a cold, a slight increase in body temperature, and only mild headache, or even no headache. The clinical symptoms do not seem like meningitis, but once it changes, many severe symptoms suddenly appear and slowly transition to a state of paralysis. At this time, even with all kinds of treatments, there is little effect, and only death ensues.</p>
<p>The course of general otitic meningitis is generally several days to a week. If it is related to hemolytic streptococcus, death is inevitable within three days, even within twenty-four hours. It is extremely dangerous if it is not discovered and treated early.</p>
<p>In short, otitic meningitis, like epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, is a very dangerous infectious disease. Although it is not often seen clinically, one must not underestimate ear diseases as minor illnesses and fail to treat them. If it unfortunately spreads to meningitis, it will be too late for regret!</p>

<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>8.  _Perilla frutescens_, Breit. Var. _Typica_ Makino</p>
<p>(Plant) Originally produced in China, it can be cultivated everywhere. It is an annual herb. The stem is square, the whole plant is covered with short hairs, the opposite leaves have long petioles and dentate green, sharp pointed tips. Terminal or axillary one-sided spicate inflorescences appear in summer and autumn, opening white small labiate flowers. The achene is slightly spherical.</p>
<p>(Component) The seeds contain approximately 40% fatty oil (perilla oil). The main components of this oil are glycerides of unsaturated fatty acids such as Olensaure and Linolensaure, mixed with a small amount of Palmitin. The iodine value of perilla oil is around 200, which is one of the highest iodine values among known vegetable oils.</p>
<p>(Uses) The seeds can be used to make perilla oil. Perilla oil has extremely strong drying properties and can be used to manufacture oil paper, umbrellas, etc.</p>
<p>9.  _Perilla frutescens_, Breit. var. _Crispa_, Decne</p>
<p>(Plant) Originally produced in China, it can be cultivated everywhere. It is an annual herb. The whole plant is very similar to _Perilla frutescens_, except that the leaves are purple and the flowers are light purple. The whole plant has a distinctive aroma.</p>
<p>Green _Perilla frutescens_ is a good variety of _Perilla frutescens_. The leaves are green, and the flowers are white.</p>
<p>(Crude drug) _Perilla_ Seed (Semen _Perillae_) is collected from its seeds. This product is yellowish-brown or dark-brown particles, approximately 1.5 mm in diameter. The weight of 100 particles is approximately 0.2 grams. The odor has a distinctive aroma.</p>
<p>_Perilla_ Leaf (Folium _Perillae_) is collected from its leaves and dried. This product is broadly ovate, approximately 10.6 cm long, with sharp tips and serrated edges. The leaf surface has obvious wrinkles and is purple in color. The petiole is approximately 1 cm long. The odor has a distinctive aroma.</p>
<p>(Component) The whole plant contains approximately 0.5% essential oil. The main component is Perillaaldehyde Croh140 (55%). This substance has the characteristic aroma of this plant, and its structural formula is as follows.</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) Traditionally, _Perilla_ leaves and _Perilla_ seeds have been used as aromatic stomachic medicines, and also as expectorant and diuretic medicines.</p>
<p>(Other uses) _Perilla_ oil is used as a flavoring for pastries. According to Japanese scholar Mr. Furukawa, _Perilla_ oil has extremely strong preservative power. For example, 20 cm of _Perilla_ oil can completely preserve one stone of soy sauce. Also, something has a sweetness equivalent to 2000 times that of sugar and also has preservative power.</p>
<p>10. _Pelctranthus rugosus_, Makino</p>
<p>(Plant) Grows wild in the mountains and fields, it is a perennial herb. The stem reaches 1-1.5 meters in height, and the whole plant is densely covered with short hairs. The leaves are opposite, petiolate, ovate, with dentate edges and sharp tips. Terminal cymose inflorescences appear in autumn, opening light purple labiate flowers. The achenes are small.</p>
<p>(Component) The whole plant contains Plectranthin, a crystalline bitter substance. This substance has an extremely strong bitter taste, and the bitter taste is not obvious until it is in a 400,000-fold aqueous solution. Administering 0.4 grams of this substance internally to a dog, or injecting 0.1 grams subcutaneously into a dog, does not cause any symptoms. Therefore, this substance is used as a harmless bitter medicine.</p>
<p>(Medicinal use) In Japanese folk medicine, it is used as a bitter stomachic medicine, and it is also commonly used for abdominal pain. The plant name _Enmeiso_ (延命草) means "life-prolonging herb." _Wakan Sansai Zue_ (和漢三才圖會) says: "It is said that a traveler was dying of abdominal pain in the mountains. Kōbō-Daishi (弘法大師) climbed the mountain and encountered him, and had him eat this herb, and he immediately recovered. Afterwards, all tests proved effective, so it was named _Teimeiso_ (定命草)."</p>

<h3 id="e227">Pessimistic View on Negotiations with Japan <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Wo</p>
<p>The tense situation and the feeling of an impending storm seemed to dissipate after Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe's meeting with President Chiang. The situation suddenly eased, creating the impression of turning hostility into friendship. This is generally how the public perceives it. However, after carefully considering the Sino-Japanese problem, I remain pessimistic about the negotiations with Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's rhetoric in its negotiations with China invariably revolves around "friendship" and "sincerity." Friendship and sincerity are certainly welcome, but they are often abstract terms. The Sino-Japanese negotiations are, in reality, about conflicting interests, where friendship and sincerity have little place. If negotiations on an issue lead to a breakdown and resort to force, naturally, peace-loving countries like ours would not want this outcome. Even our aggressive neighbor, fond of war, would likely avoid it, as resorting to force would inevitably lead to significant sacrifices for both sides, regardless of who emerges victorious. Therefore, the talk of friendship and sincerity is merely diplomatic hypocrisy, devoid of genuine meaning.</p>
<p>Even in terms of friendship and sincerity, there are limits to friendship and inherent qualities to sincerity. Suppose Party A makes a demand on Party B, and Party B fulfills it to their satisfaction. In that case, Party A would naturally be pleased, considering it genuine friendship and sincere cooperation. However, can Party B be satisfied, friendly, or sincere? If Party B cannot meet the demands, they will inevitably accuse the other side of lacking sincerity and friendship. Therefore, sincerity and friendship are entirely dependent on the issue of mutual rights and cannot be resolved by empty words.</p>
<p>In the current diplomatic situation, although the tense atmosphere between the two sides has eased somewhat after Sangjima's visit to China and Kawagoe's meeting with Chiang, the Japanese side still insists on the special status of North China and joint anti-communist defense. This stance is vastly different from our principle of mutual benefit and equality and the preservation of territorial sovereignty. If the Japanese side adheres to this policy and refuses to back down, the hope for peace is minimal. Therefore, the outcome of peace or tension depends entirely on whether the Japanese authorities can thoroughly understand the situation. The key lies with the Japanese side, not with our country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report from the China United Press in Tokyo, Japan is determined to obtain North China, intending to adopt a "take the substance, avoid the name" approach. The so-called "take the substance, avoid the name" means occupying North China in reality without the official title, implementing economic aggression in lieu of territorial occupation. Japan has employed numerous approaches in its negotiations with our country, but they all boil down to the same thing: a hundred changes that do not deviate from their core purpose. This is, in fact, a major misjudgment in the policy of the Japanese authorities. The Japanese side constantly proclaims the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity. China and Japan are not only geographically connected but also share common interests. They are not only of the same culture but also interdependent like lips and teeth. Today, while Japan advocates this principle, they fail to fully understand it, seeking only their own immediate interests and neglecting long-term goals. Truly, their policymakers are irresponsible.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the Japanese side truly wishes to establish friendly and sincere cooperation with us, it must first abandon its aggressive ambitions, remove its menacing facade, and engage in open and honest discussions on mutual interests. This would not only benefit China and Japan but also the future of East Asia. If the Japanese side fails to consider this, the consequences will be beyond our imagination.</p>

<p>— Si</p>
<p>— No one on the wild ferry, the boat floats adrift.</p>
<p>When such a poetic scene appeared before my eyes, I was admiring it silently, wearing tattered clothes and carrying the heart of a wanderer.</p>
<p>It was the early autumn season. In the south, a cool breeze began to blow, and a unique, nameless fragrance drifted into my nostrils, gradually intoxicating me within the embrace of nature, placing me within a most beautiful landscape painting, where I began to dream the rosy dreams of youth.</p>
<p>However, I was wandering! And I was threatened by hunger! The cold days were fast approaching! Where was I to go?</p>
<p>I crossed my legs and sat on the grass. In front of me was a quiet stream, the water as clear as a mirror, only rippling slightly when the wind brushed across its surface. The stream was not wide, but I looked around and saw no bridge. The only way to cross the bank was by ferry. So, I gazed across to the other side, where the fields were green tinged with yellow, presenting the sight of half-ripened crops and sparse houses. Seen from afar, the houses looked even smaller, like accessories in a watercolor painting. The trees were indistinguishable, and further away, the snakelike mountains meandered, stubbornly crouching on the land. The sky was vast, an expanse of blue, with the white clouds characteristic of autumn flying and darting about. The sun shone brightly, illuminating everything with clarity and tranquility. It was truly a captivating scene.</p>
<p>Gazing at the distant fields, quietly... the wind whispered in my ears... the sun smiled happily! I felt an indescribable emotion, and I calmed down for a while.</p>
<p>Finally, I discovered the unmanned wild ferry lying on the stream to the left, with a support pole standing there. It floated on the surface of the water, with one side leaning against the grass. Upon discovering this wild ferry, I got up from the grass and ran over to it.</p>
<p>I should go to the other side, where there were houses and smoke rising, weren't there?</p>
<p>But I stopped beside the wild ferry, hesitating. This watercolor-like scene; here beside the stream in autumn, could I not quietly enjoy the happiness that nature had bestowed? I stood there woodenly, my heart pounding! It would ruin the scenery to load myself onto this wild ferry and cross to the other side! But I was so hungry! I was plunged into great anxiety.</p>
<p>The sound of light footsteps approaching from behind in the grass startled me from my thoughts. Appearing beside me was a hunched old man, holding a pipe but not smoking it. He sized me up and then began to speak:</p>
<p>"You're standing here by the stream, staring at the water. What are you thinking? You're new here, aren't you? Where are you planning to go?"</p>
<p>"I was wondering if this wild ferry could carry me to the other side," I replied, facing his wrinkled face. "If I have to walk, where is the bridge? Can you tell me?"</p>
<p>"There is a bridge, but you have to walk five more li to the east. But it's almost lunchtime now."</p>
<p>He turned his face away, and I turned my face away as well. In the near distance, across a short field, the chimney of a farmhouse was smoking. At the same time, I saw a girl in blue cloth walking towards us, smiling and revealing two rows of white teeth, with one hand placed on her forehead to shield her eyes from the sunlight. The old man knew that his daughter had come to call him to lunch, and he invited me to go back with him. I declined... until the charming farm girl insisted that I stay here until the afternoon before leaving, I submitted.</p>
<p>What a bountiful lunch it was—I marveled in my heart. Leaving the farmhouse, I was accompanied by the old man's daughter, who said she would take me to the bridge. I refused, thanking her sincerely... Before we knew it, we had returned to the wild ferry, where there was still a cool autumn breeze, a bright field, and rippling water.</p>
<p>"Let's part here," I said, my voice trembling.</p>
<p>She initially kept her head down; after hearing my words, she raised it and, facing the distant fields, said to me:</p>
<p>"By this gurgling stream, I have seen off countless travelers. They have all gone and never returned. Where are you going? Are you just going to flow like this stream, flowing, flowing, all the way ahead?"</p>
<p>"I am a wanderer..." I said.</p>
<p>We parted silently! I went east to the bridge to cross to the other side, leaving the wild ferry and the farm girl behind, moving forward on my own, without looking back.</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Mule Train <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>It's October!</p>
<p>The camellias, two zhang tall, are bursting with bright red flowers. The sight is so dense that from afar, it looks like a piece of red cloth has been dropped in mid-air. The sun struggles to penetrate the thick layers of flowers, its light strangely weak, as if filtered through a dense, thick red gauze, with a hint of ethereal red.</p>
<p>The mountain sparrows constantly flutter among the camellia trees, incessantly pecking at the branches with their hard beaks.</p>
<p>A gust of mountain wind blows, scattering the bright red petals into the sky, dancing for a long while before slowly drifting down, densely, like a rain of red. The ground resembles a newly laid red carpet, soft and fluffy, and even fragrant.</p>
<p>It is extremely quiet in this mountain, almost to the point where you can hear the footsteps of ants. Except for the occasional mule train passing through, (Note 1) it's rare for anyone to pass by here. So, the mountain is shrouded in loneliness all day long.</p>
<p>A dark mass, estimated to be around five hundred mules. The copper bell on the lead mule rings "ding-dong" with the mountain wind. The hooves beat out a dull rhythm, and on the back of each mule is a wooden pack saddle laden with goods. Following behind, spaced by dozens of mules, is a young man in a sheepskin vest, adorned with silver coins as buttons, wearing straw sandals with red laces. His trousers are pulled up high, and his face is a ruddy color, with strong arms and legs. He holds a leather whip in his hand, gently flicking it at the few lagging animals.</p>
<p>"Old Li, why don't we 'kai shao' yet?" (Note 2) says a man with a face full of sweat. He spits and wipes his sweat with his right sleeve.</p>
<p>"Who knows? It's boring to travel like this," says the man called Old Li.</p>
<p>"You lecher! There are no women here, of course you're bored!"</p>
<p>Ha... ha... The two laughed.</p>
<p>Brothers,</p>
<p>Keep at it!</p>
<p>Keep moving on,</p>
<p>Find an inn at the market town tonight!</p>
<p>The inn has a pretty girl,</p>
<p>The leader, riding a horse, catches up from behind, singing as he passes the brothers. Then, the brothers instinctively join in the song!</p>
<p>With a beautiful face,</p>
<p>And gleaming black hair,</p>
<p>Her delicate hands serve tea,</p>
<p>They sing loudly, the song echoing in the mountain valley, strangely pleasant. The brothers' feet gain strength, and the dying troop is once again filled with vigorous energy.</p>
<p>The night gradually descends, the earth draped in a layer of black gauze. The mountain wind howls, frighteningly. It is two days before the first quarter moon, so the moon is just a sliver, its light faint, with only a few scattered stars. The clouds are racing quickly. If it were not for the faint moonlight, the mountain would be completely plunged into darkness.</p>
<p>"Kai shao!" the leader calls out, raising his left arm.</p>
<p>"Brothers in the back, hurry up and catch up!"</p>
<p>"Hurry up, it's time for dinner!"</p>
<p>... A chaotic, joyful tone.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the brothers in the back surge forward like a tide. The leader orders the removal of the pack saddles and dispatches some brothers to graze the animals, while others go to find large stones and firewood. Only about ten remain to guard the pack saddles.</p>
<p>They skillfully select three stones of roughly the same size and arrange them in a triangle. They place the pot on top and start a fire underneath to cook the meal.</p>
<p>"Brothers, you've worked hard today, eat up! Have a hearty meal!" the leader says kindly.</p>
<p>"Let's all eat our fill!" A cheer erupts from their hearts.</p>
<p>After the meal, those who went to find firewood return with it, the mules are all tethered, and the remaining brothers, with nothing to do, smoke and chat. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Cao Xiaoying's "Yu Qing Ting" (Jade Dragonfly)</p>
<p>Zhongxi (1040), 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM. Opening: One of the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, "Zeng Shen Bites His Finger in Heartfelt Pain"</p>
<p>In a remote and desolate little village,</p>
<p>Farmers, woodcutters, scholars, and fishermen fill the town.</p>
<p>Recluses often emerge from the deep mountains,</p>
<p>Passing their days behind brushwood gates and thatched doors.</p>
<p>Most are leisurely and refined guests,</p>
<p>Secretly lamenting and writing poetry under the moon.</p>
<p>There was a handsome young woodcutter,</p>
<p>Who turned out to be the virtuous Zeng Shen, carrying firewood into the mountains.</p>
<p>He was a disciple of Confucius, receiving his teachings,</p>
<p>Caring for his mother with utmost filial piety.</p>
<p>Everyone in the village knew of the filial son Zeng,</p>
<p>And the whole town spread the word of his goodness.</p>
<p>One day, Zeng Shen went into the mountains carrying an axe,</p>
<p>To chop wood and buy rice for his dear mother.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a guest arrived at his home,</p>
<p>Leaving Zeng's mother at a loss as to how to entertain the visitor.</p>
<p>Her purse was empty, with no good solution,</p>
<p>Having neither wine nor food nor money.</p>
<p>She waited anxiously for her son's quick return, but he was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Knowing their close maternal bond,</p>
<p>With a breath connecting them, they responded to each other.</p>
<p>Biting her finger with a resolute heart,</p>
<p>Zeng Shen felt an unbearable pain in his heart.</p>
<p>He hurriedly returned home with firewood,</p>
<p>And knelt down to ask his mother the reason.</p>
<p>Zeng's mother immediately opened her mouth and said,</p>
<p>"A guest has just arrived at our humble abode.</p>
<p>Because you haven't returned and I have few means,</p>
<p>I bit my finger to send you a message, ordering you home."</p>
<p>What a truly filial son, the sage Zeng Shen,</p>
<p>Such profound affection is rare in the world.</p>
<p>The fine hairs on the animal, separate from the fur, know the ruler.</p>
<p>Chen Lianqing, Qi Lianfang's "Little Money"</p>
<p>Xin Sheng (1380), midnight to 12:45 AM.</p>
<p>Opening: "Jia Baoyu"</p>
<p>Nüwa refined stones to mend the sky's flaw.</p>
<p>She left behind a dull and useless stone.</p>
<p>Having endured countless years of wind, frost, heat, and cold,</p>
<p>At the foot of Great Waste Mountain, it shone.</p>
<p>The Boundless Monk guided him with words.</p>
<p>The Vague Immortal brought him home.</p>
<p>The stone gained sentience and entered a mother's womb.</p>
<p>Born into the Jia family, with noble lineage.</p>
<p>The milk name Baoyu was not unintentional.</p>
<p>For at birth, he came into the world with jade in his mouth.</p>
<p>Lady Dowager Shi cherished him like a treasure,</p>
<p>Often worrying about wind and rain harming him.</p>
<p>His every move was attended by maids.</p>
<p>Then came the beautiful Lin Daiyu,</p>
<p>Ranking her first among the Twelve Beauties.</p>
<p>From childhood, they had a special connection,</p>
<p>Whispering intimately and staying by each other's side.</p>
<p>They played with flowers and fought grass for joy,</p>
<p>Applying rouge and powder near delicate eyebrows.</p>
<p>She accompanied him even in the embroidered pavilion, contemplating Zen.</p>
<p>What a romantic and unrestrained young master Jia.</p>
<p>But at the mention of diligent study, he frowned.</p>
<p>Alas, the strict family education forced him to pursue his lessons.</p>
<p>Xiren and Sheyue often advised him,</p>
<p>Saying, "Step on the golden turtle and rise like thunder from the ground."</p>
<p>To win glory for his ancestors and revitalize the family.</p>
<p>Yet he was looked down upon by many inferior scholars,</p>
<p>Who said he was a wandering romantic and ultimately useless.</p>
<p>Ever since I dreamt of entering the Red Chamber,</p>
<p>I have lost all ambition for wealth and fame.</p>
<p>Only Lin Gu understands my heart,</p>
<p>Willing to die for love and become ashes,</p>
<p>Better than standing alone at the head of the list and accompanying the spring boudoir.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed several years of a young master's happiness,</p>
<p>To repay his parents' toil, he reluctantly went to the autumn examinations.</p>
<p>Water flows east and never returns.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenyu's "Righteous Demon Transmission"</p>
<p>Yuanchang (1120), 12:45 AM to 1:30 AM. Opening: "Ode to the Red Cliff"</p>
<p>The romantic scholar was banished to Huangzhou,</p>
<p>Enjoying himself every day by the river.</p>
<p>On the day after the renshen mid-autumn,</p>
<p>He chatted with two or three close friends,</p>
<p>Carefree, they boarded a boat to the Red Cliff.</p>
<p>Soon, the moon rose from the eastern mountains,</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing, they gazed at the Dipper constellation.</p>
<p>Striking the strings, they sang of the bright moon,</p>
<p>Repeatedly toasting with overflowing cups.</p>
<p>With each clear song and sip of wine,</p>
<p>Guests harmonized with the Xiao, the sounds and rhythms profound.</p>
<p>It was like a widow weeping in a lonely boat.</p>
<p>How lamentable, Cao Mengde of that time,</p>
<p>Composing poems and brandishing his spear, filled with ambition.</p>
<p>He descended to Jiangling,</p>
<p>And conquered Jingzhou.</p>
<p>The axis turned a thousand miles, riding the favorable wind.</p>
<p>Indeed, he was a hero of his age,</p>
<p>But who knows where he is now?</p>
<p>Thirty-six thousand days pass easily.</p>
<p>How fortunate is life, merely a mayfly's existence.</p>
<p>One must see through false fame and profit,</p>
<p>Speaking of poverty and success, I too feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Wash the cups and pour wine, clear away the dishes,</p>
<p>The scattered cups and plates are not arranged as one wishes.</p>
<p>They shared a pillow on the small boat.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Streamlined Comedy of 1936, "Little Lingzi" to be Released Soon <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The new Star Motion Picture Production "Little Lingzi," following "Night of Revelry" at the Jincheng Theater, is a good movie that is very much worth recommending. This film has been completed for a long time, but has only been released recently due to the congestion of new films from various companies in the theaters.</p>
<p>"Little Lingzi" tells the story of a village girl who is tempted by vanity and profit and runs into the city as the central theme. The author here strongly exposes the sins of the metropolis. This current society, which creates all sins, devours a pure and innocent little girl. This is a work with very high social value, and it is worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Zhao Dan and Shu Xiuwen in "Qingming Season" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>This play is praised as a streamlined comedy of 1933. The whole play has a bright and harmonious tone. Those who have seen the preview have praised it as having the style of an American film.</p>
<p>The director is Mr. Cheng Bugao, and he has put a lot of effort into the handling of this play. The leading actors are Tan Ying, Zhao Dan, Mei Xi, Gong Jianong, etc.</p>
<p>Tan Ying has achieved extraordinary results here, and her role is also the most important one. She has made extraordinary efforts here, and will undoubtedly gain a new evaluation. Zhao Dan and Mei Xi, one playing a young master of the city and the other playing a farmer in the countryside, both have excellent performances.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Amateur Actors and "The Forties" Co-star in "Sai Jinhua" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Amateurs have given way to avoid head-to-head competition, hoping they can join hands</p>
<p>We heard months ago that amateur actors were preparing to perform "Sai Jinhua," but the search for a suitable female lead delayed the performance until a graduate of the Art Academy, named Xu Wuyin, was introduced to play the role of Sai Jinhua. However, while the amateur actors were asking Ouyang Yuqian to direct the play, "The Forties" also announced that they would perform the play and had signed a contract with Jincheng to perform it at the end of the month.</p>
<p>At the same time, "The Forties" also wanted to invite Ouyang Yuqian to direct, and Ouyang Yuqian contacted both parties about this matter, hoping that they could cooperate, because a head-to-head competition would cause losses to both sides in terms of time, energy, and money, and besides, they should be joining hands.</p>
<p>But there was no result. So the amateur actors held a general discussion on how to deal with this matter. After discussion, it was decided that "Sai Jinhua" must be performed, because there was no suitable script to perform at the moment, and to avoid a head-to-head competition, the amateur actors wrote a letter to "The Forties" in a spirit of friendship, asking them to perform at the end of the month, while the amateurs would postpone it to the end of next month or the beginning of December, performing for a week at the Carlton. However, for the sake of the actors' energy, it would be divided into two stages, with "China Travel Service" taking over in between.</p>
<p>This method is very good, but it is hoped that the two troupes will join hands immediately after performing "Sai Jinhua," and we wish them success!</p>
<h3 id="e237">Valuable Harvest of Newsreel <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Close-up Taken When Hu Hanmin Was in the Coffin, to Be Released at the Same Time as "Mother's Love"</p>
<p>When Mr. Hu Hanmin's remains were in the coffin, Minxin sent photographer Luo Jinghao to Guangzhou to shoot a newsreel. At that time, there were dozens of film companies competing to shoot the news, but none of them were allowed, except for Minxin, which was specially allowed to photograph all the details of the coffin. Afterwards, other companies planned to jointly invest in the purchase of the newsreel, but Minxin decided to keep it and did not sell it. It is said that this valuable newsreel and other Minxin newsreels will be released at the same time as the first production of "Mother's Love."</p>
