<p>平津靑年之思想可分爲左傾右傾與自由三派而觀乎學聯之負責人物及各大學之出版物則左傾勢力之支配蓋無疑義右傾力量除一二大學外幾不存在而中間份子畏首畏尾者厭聞救國之事明哲保身者閉戶讀書有因失望而趨於頹廢者感傷者有因刺激過度而精神反常者敎授之中除少數素以左傾理論爲靑年所喜者近來甚受歡迎外其餘多不聞不問不負責任而爲靑年所輕視更有提倡不要中年只要靑年者際此危急存亡之際知識份子竟左右有分老少有別怨天尤人謗甲毀乙偏見甚重者若謂非我藥劑不足以救中國此種現象可憂亦可悲也</p>
<p>學生運動之無成效無統一之陣錢靑年應負之責任不若政府所應負者之大而政府應負之責任更不若敎授所應負者之大蓋在此種局面之下稍有人性稍有中國民族之意識就不思求一出路况平津靑年每日所見所聞罔非亡國亡種之現象與消息政府之具體政策彼輩或根本不知或根本不了解於是彼輩於政府發生懷疑於目前之大難愈覺不可終日奸黠者利用此情緒於是故作危辭更施挑撥靑年思想如水之就下蓋熱情之橫溢如黃河之水不加以善導必泛濫而成災敎育當局但求太平無事孰知表面上暫時太平無事卽來日更不太平之醞釀也</p>
<p>然在今日情形之下欲政府當局能領導靑年導之於正軌蓋甚困難之事此種領導權應操在敎授之手彼輩理性較强智識經騐較豐於國家之危急雖感覺力尚不若靑年之尖銳靈敏於國家出路問題難關如何渡過問題至少比靑年之認識爲正確彼輩應知一味在呼浩哭無補實際極端思想與行動反弱自己之陣勢而引起本不希望存在之問題也乃彼輩大半袖手旁觀以爲靑年旣走極端當局只知高壓敎授已事無可爲惟有金人三緘其口此種態度甚爲錯誤百世之下必指今日之智識界領導份子爲國家民族之罪人也可不勉哉</p>

<h3>日本新任駐華大使　川越茂之抱負與生平　外務省唯一之中國通主張對華外交一元化</h3>
<p>（東京）政府决定起用駐天津總領事川越茂爲駐蔡大使、廣田首相請求日皇裁可之結果、於十五日上午十一時在宮中舉行視任式、日皇賜親任　語、並投以如左官記、任命從四位勳二等川越茂爲特命全權大使、駐　中華民國、（十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>（電通社上海消息）駐華大使川越茂、爲宮崎縣人、明治四十一年（西曆一九〇八年）卒業東京帝大法科、翌年入鐵道院、任鐵道院書記之職、約二年、大正元年、入外務者、所謂外務省之二十期組也、同期、除現外務省情報部長天羽英二歐亞局長東鄉茂德兩氏外、尚有與川越同擬駐華大使之前拓務次官坪上貞二﹑川越新大使之外交官經歷、初爲領事官補、服務哈爾濱、其後歷任沙市。漢口。領事、本省通商局。亞細亞局。勤務、瑞西公使館·德國大使館。書記官、吉林總領事、靑島總領事、「滿洲國」大使館初代參事官、廣東總領事、天成總領事、以迄於今、在外交界生活二十餘年、其大半在華、足跡遍於南北、蓋外務省唯一之中國通也、其爲人沉默寡言、談白自甘、無論何時、絕少用外國語、有謂川越氏由天津總領事陞駐華大使、由於陸軍方面之推薦者、此乃偏見蓋一思及官界任官之期、爲陞進之最大要素、卽可知川越氏之親任大使、乃當然之順序、如重光元次官爲一期先輩之二十期、駐華大使呼聲甚高之谷駐滿大使館參事官、爲一期後輩之二十二期、石射上海總領事、爲一十四期、因川越氏在軍部之上層中堅、有許多之知己、遂由此點謂軍之意向、反映外交、此非事實、氏於日本外交有一信念、昭和七年八月、任駐滿大使館參事官（駐滿大使故武藤元帥）、已爲事實上之大使、然在任僅二月、携日滿議定書之原本、赴東京後、拒絕復任可以知之、有田外相就任後、努力决定今後對華政策之基調、已得到大體之成案、認川越氏爲遂行此政策之適任者、故起用之、故今後之對華外交、必如有田外相之希望、完全一元化、日本之對華外交一元化、國民政府較諸日本自身更爲熱望、故中國方面對於川越大使之來任、可與以相當之期待、又川越氏爲外交批評家、在外務省文名素著云、</p>
<h3>華北走私問題　日當局之狡辯　口頭覆英美抗議　謂與日官塲無關</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據此間消息、日本答覆英美對於華北走私問題之抗議、完全吾認與日本官場有關、其意似謂日本並不欲中傷中國之經濟地位、亦不欲摧毀外國貨物之市塲（十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日外務省發言人照例每日接見新聞訪員時，各訪　對於華北走私事紛加詢問、該發言人閃爍其詞、謂此乃中國之內務、至走私所以達今日之程度者、乃因中國稅則過高、及因中國海關人員缺乏熱誠所致、發言人不欲述及英美大使關於該問題提出之詰問及日外相有吉之答覆詳情、繼請訪員對外傳走私之風大熾、乃由日本壓迫中國海關所致之說提出「切實之證據」、又謂渠以爲何應欽與梅津之協定、未必使華北日軍須解除中國海關職員與巡船之武裝、日本現在天津所取之步驟、乃欲保護日人正當之商業利益、此項利益因走私之結果、頗受損害云﹑次乃談及日本增加華北戍軍事、謂「冀東自治政府」管轄境內及北寗鐵路一帶之日僑、近已增多、駐華日軍人數太少　遇緊急時殊難滿意盡其職責、故陸軍省乃决議遵照庚子和的之規定增加日軍人數、陸軍省當局之意見、以爲此舉並不侵犯華北中國之主權、亦非侵奪外國在華所享之權利、陸軍省現信日本籍此可調整日本華北「滿洲國」與其他外國間之關係云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>華北走私猖獗真因　日軍利用走私壓迫我國　冀遂其在政治上之企圖</h3>
<p>字林報云、華北海關緝私當道如不受無理之阻撓、則可順利辦公、不出多星期、力能消滅走私活動、或使之减至不足介意之程度、而恢復其對輸入華北各口岸貨物之正當管理權、蓋自海關緝私機關近今增厚實力、保護海關利益之一切措施改組之後、成效極佳、故此言决非空談也、海關緝私隊今每年能偵得希圖走私之貨達八百萬元、其應付之關稅約三百萬元、此種效果、顯然非辦公不力所能得到者、近據官場報告、華北走私在一九三三年（譯者按就下文觀之似爲一九三五年）五月底以前、猶不能任所欲爲、當時僅有小規模之走私、殊易加以遏止、北寗鐵路一帶固有白銀違法由山海關輸出、但直至是年四月以後、其數始漸增多、韓人與日人之走私者、不避關員之干涉、培增其努力、至一九三五年五月、日軍事當局迫令海關巡隊撤離山海關、並實行解除緝私人員之武裝、於是局勢當然因以大變、海關緝私隊遂失其立場矣、夫以赤手空拳之緝私員﹑而須應付携有武器之走私者、不啻以卵投石、其無勢力之可言也、正不足異、</p>
<p>是年九月、日當局復下令謂按照迄未公布塘沽協定之條欵、海關緝私船應退至非武裝區域三哩界限以外、緝私船不得在三哩界限以內從事緝私、日當局繼更變本加厲、宣布如在三哩界限以外干涉日船、則將視爲海盜行刦、而以禦盜方法對付之、於是走私者益肆無忌憚、易言之、卽蘆台至山海關間海濱二哩外之緝私工作、僅得施於中國船隻、於是走私之船全懸日旗、走私者由大連至中國海濱、均能通行無阻、私貨在海濱擇定之地點卸岸、無人敢加禁阻、卸岸後、卽由鐵路運至天津、且不難運至中國其他各口岸、鐵路當局向不能與海關合作、故目前無法遏止華北私貨之運銷各地、就報告觀之、海關緝私隊現盡其職責、實未獲其自己政府之協助、此尤爲不幸之事、蓋華南走私、賴海關當局嚴緝之力、近已大减、此可以運入中國該部分報關貨物之數字確見增高爲徵、蓋緝私隊之認眞服務、已使由民船私運入廣州之貨物减至最低之數矣、查海關緝私船隊、共有大船二十五艘、另有自一九二九年起造成從事地方工作之小船四十艘、該隊成立未久、而成績卓著、殊堪欽佩、陸地各口岸各站所沿海關卡邊界區之海關職員﹑亦認眞合作、以杜私運、近並在各處組織海關防隊、以增厚一般緝私工作、</p>
<p>地方官對於緝私隊、多無所助、有時且加以妨碍、實際不　鼓勵走私、惟海關政策向以圓通爲主、以期消除異議、而終獲合作、此項政策、行之未嘗無效、但處今日華北之局勢中、此項政策難望有效、蓋該處走私爭端﹑今已非關於財政之事件﹑而顯然成爲國際政治之重大問題矣、彼本評論家茲已承認此點、坦眞聲言彼等之意見以爲日軍事當局用此走私運動迫令中政府承認谷種未規定之條伴、以鞏固中日兩國問之關係、實屬正當云、故海關緝私隊現在外方橫加之限制以　竭力盡其職責、而對目前發生之局勢、絲毫不負其咎、蓋自己政府不予以保護、則緝私隊　然無力以抵抗外國侵略者所張示之武力也、此一爭端進行不已、海關之完整將陷於危境外債亦岌岌可危、而外國貿易似亦將被擾亂至不堪之地步也、</p>
<h3>英德間作密切接洽</h3>

<h3>農村生活叢談</h3>
<p>— 俞慶棠主編</p>
<p>浙江湖屬一帶的蠶農生活　吳曉晨</p>
<p>顯露出農民爲求生活而投機「三張糙棉紙，三升西瓜子，好呢，造屋娶妻子，不好，上海去拉車子·」</p>
<p>這是浙西農村裏最流行的農歌，從這首農歌上，已充分顯露出農民投機心理的熱烈，本來養蠶和種瓜，均是農民的副業，誰都認爲無足重輕的，但是浙西農家·却反客爲主，以爲養蠶可希冀萬一·所以過去對於桑地的推廣，很爲努力，湖屬也成爲中國蠶絲的重要區域之一·但自海外絲價頻落以還，蠶絲區域內的農民，頓然如失重心，追源求始，大概是中這首農歌的遺毒吧？可是農民並不追悔過去，以爲失之東隅，仍可收之桑楡，因此又改　易轍，視種瓜爲生財大道了·不過瓜田的增加，實肇端於絲繭的破產，而西瓜產量驟增的結果，瓜價之跌落遂如江流之日下，最後是催促農村在短期內更迅速的沒落·</p>
<p>稻田是漸漸的縮小了</p>
<p>湖屬一帶桑地的廣闊，眞是一望無際，凡是到過浙西的人，想來都能見到·農家對於桑地的經營，更是鞠躬盡瘁，這是可以拿立於同一地位的稻田來比較而知道的·本來浙西各屬，河流暢達，宜於植稻·但農民因爲企圖衣食住各方面能够漸入佳境，桑地的而積遂逐漸增多，所餘留下來的稻田，漸漸地狹隘了·他們的心思，以為稻田所生產的米榖，祗須足供全家幾口一個年頭的食糧就是了，其他一切支出，如地租，田賦，肥料等項，完全可以從蠶桑上着想的·所以平時加意培植桑地，甚至不惜剜肉醫瘡，把稻田的泥土，翻到桑地上來，意欲使大利所在的桑樹，頃刻葱籠·故湖屬一帶桑地和稻田，往往高低相去很遠，使貴州人見了，或者要驚奇這裹竟也有梯田呢·</p>
<p>忍痛的實行寅吃卯糧</p>
<p>還在不久以前，每逢到了春天，浙西一帶城鄉市鎮，凡是商旅雲集的地方，都有一種應時的買賣，這就是蠶桑區域所獨有的桑秧·而且買賣二方，都是農民，所以由鄉間挑上市集的桑秧，結果是依舊回到鄉間·還有從餘杭和紹興二個地方運來的蠶種，也是一項有聲有色的買賣，但這却造成中間人剝削農民的機會了；因爲蠶種是由別處販運米，當然要幾度轉手，纔能達到農民手中，於是遂有一輩唯利是圖的人，利用農民貧乏，躉批了大批蠶種，賒給農家，期間甚短，而取利則極昂，無力現購的農民，也祇得忍痛犧牲·而貧苦的農家，若然到了年底，因爲帳欵和租稅的追索，急如星火一時無法張羅現欵，况又在寒氣逼人的冬天，破的棉襖，和舊的皮掛，爲要保護軀體的溫暖不能拿去典質，那末他們也來仿照政府發行債券的方式，實行寅吃卯糧，把明春的桑葉預先出賣，那時很有資木家紛紛乘機收進，價格每担二元，是固定的·所以農家所種桑地每年產量若干，這筆收入，可以預先抵用的，因此農民更感覺到植桑比較有意義了，　預的農民還未深切瞭解靑葉盛行預賣，正是資本家一種最苛酷的搜刮手腕呢？即知道，又有什麼辦法呢？要知預先出賣靑葉的農家，旣非眞正的桑葉過剩，以故賣出的數量愈冬就可知道這家農家寅吃卯糧的程度越高，所感受的經濟壓迫，也最深刻·農家爲欲消除這種痛苦，到了次年春天，仍然如痴如狂的育蠶，希望大大的賺一筆錢·但是我們要明白，育蠶所最緊要而不容缺少的桑葉，很多農家，早已出售一空，到了蠶汛時，大半皆在資本家掌握之中了，資本家買這許多桑葉，他們自己並不養蠶，完全是借此壟斷的·因此在蠶汛時，資本家手中的桑葉，越是奇貨可居，桑葉的價格，也就愈來得飛騰暴升，往往漲到七八元一担，也是常見的事·農民因爲飼蠶刻不待緩，任他貴到怎樣地步，祇得忍痛收買下來，你想仍是一担桑葉，經過資本家轉手以後，農民無端要損失多少錢·然而資本家的慾望，還未以爲滿足哩！</p>
<p>「加一鈿」在浙西是素來風行的農家因了年底急於用錢，不得已把靑業預賣來　注，但是次年春天，農家並無生產依然不名一錢，鬣種還可以賒欠，重價的桑葉，從那裹去籌集資本來買呢？在這個當兒高利貸者現出了猙獰的面目，施展他無上的權威，他們拿現欵米借給農民，約定鮮繭售去償還，前後不過廿餘天的期間，你道要加多少息金，說來眞是駭人，每借十個銀元，要外加利息一偭銀元若以年利來核算，竟達百分之一百以上，農民那得不掙扎於貧窮綫下，而農村經濟之枯澀，由此亦可想見一斑·這名稱叫加一鈿，在浙西素向是風行無阻，也爲任何人所習知·故照鄉農估計，每張糙棉紙最低可獲利四五十元，然而如此剝削重重，不要說區區四五十元，即使可以一本萬利，也無非使農民洗手徒勞，甚至非賠貼不可·</p>
<p>也有因養蠶而傾家蕩產</p>
<p>况且能够求助於高利貸的農民還是較勝一籌的貧農、其他更艱苦的農家、儘有呼　無門任你願出更高的利息，也難如願以償；那末他們實在沒有方法，飼蠶的桑葉，是一刻不能間斷的，到了這走頭無路的時候說也傷心，祇得把生活所關的蠶，傾棄一部，這筆損失，不是最覺得可惜嗎？但也有可以借債，而自願傾棄的，此乃因爲農民　守成法，對於蠶務一無把握，假使中途起了變化，認爲希望黯淡，再培養下去，豈不徒然增加債額，所以也祇得割愛·因此農民每到新年裏，要預知蠶汛的結果怎樣，求籤問卜，無微不至·然而我們要曉得，養蠶第一要有廣大的場所，而於風雨雷鳴的防止，和嚴寒燠暖的調節，更是息息相關·那知農家所住的，大半是僅可蔽風雨的破屋，設備之簡陋，不言可知，這樣矛盾的環境，其爲不相宜，是無從掩飾的·且農家在蠶汛時，一切諱忌極深，殺緊張時候，甚至旁人不得貿然登門入窒，其對於養蠶方法之缺乏研究和討論，是可知道了·這樣說來，農家養蠶，事前則設備不全，臨場復無人指示，故事後亦難挽救，以致蠶汛惡劣的聲浪，也就時時傳到我們的耳鼓中來，因着養蠶傾家蕩產的也時有所聞呢·</p>
<p>舍了養蠶來種瓜</p>
<p>蠶絲區域內農家的耕地，旣大部分是桑地，現在桑地也因着預賣靑葉，及鮮繭祇値十餘元，實不足抵償桑地本身的地租·那末農民全家生活，要靠範圍甚小的稻田來支持，當然是不可能的事，因此瓜田的勃興，也可說是適逢其會·不過瓜田所以能够繼議桑事　後而如火如荼，却還有二個原因：　種瓜正和養蠶一般已是極有進出的生涯，失望於養蠶的人正可以此背城借一　農民生活旣日形艱苦，資金流通的機會，也等於告絕，因之農民需欵之急迫，亦非往昔能够東賖西欠時所可同日而語·若欲解决此項困難，乃不得不以收穫期間比較短促的東西，來補救這種缺憾，除蠶外，祇有西瓜够得上快的資格·但是因爲購買力的關係，售瓜所得，很多的僅敷肥料一項成本呢！</p>
<p>這些都是農村沒落的有力象徵目前養蠶的時令，又已到來，種瓜也爲期不速，農家備受創傷以後，想來也可覺悟到這條路不是生財之道；什麼希望衣食住漸入佳境，都不過是幻想，倘使再這樣下去，勢非出賣耕地（浙西農田大都有永　權故雖係租來仍可買賣）來抵償債務，眞的非去拉車子不可了·然而自推廣桑地以至縮小稻田，本已是農村經濟的病態，今復擴大瓜田，使稻的生產益形减少，更可說是農村沒落的有力象徵·民食的艱難，或也　端於此吧！</p>

<h3>滬市　擴大航空救國運動　吳市長昨日播音演講航寬運動與民族復興</h3>
<p>上海市長吳鐵城·爲上海市擴大航空救國運動、十五日下午五時、在市播音台、播音講演「航空運動與民族復興、」其演詞云、</p>
<p>諸君、中國航空協會·本年爲擴大航空救國運動、並募欵購機、呈獻政府、爲蔣委員長五十壽辰紀念、特委託鐵城向本市三百五十萬市民、作募疑購機的擴大運動、上海市民、目前年發起航空救國以後、一時各地風起雲湧、踴躍輸將、紛紛購機、獻助政府、頗著成績、而此次運動、更附有擁戴領袖之新意義、我們市民、尤其應當本以往之熱誠、起而贊助、使此次運動、得有更大之影響、與更大之成功﹑</p>
<p>現在的世界、因爲科學文化的發展、一切都在飛躍的猛進著、即就國防與軍事而論、最近幾年的進步、亦深足驚人、從前的軍事家、以海岸爲第一防綫、自空軍發展以後、海防已失其作用、從前的軍事家、都以坦克車爲作戰的利器﹑自空軍發展以後、其破壞力與戰鬥力、邦尤遠在坦克車之上、所以法國名將福煦曾說、「在第二次世界大戰中、最活躍而有力的﹑就是飛機、將來戰鬥的陣容、必係大規模的飛機隊﹑馳騁天空、而其破壞能力、尤遠勝於海陸軍、可使敵國軍心渙散、解除武裝、將來的空軍、實爲戰爭勝敗的主動力、」</p>
<p>歐戰以後、各國的國防建設、莫不以空軍爲中心、各國空軍的設備、都有驚人的進步、其中尤以法國爲最、空軍人員、有四萬餘名、常備軍用飛機、有三千餘架、且都是精銳之器、俄國目五年計劃完成以後、國防建設、也有驚人的發展、其常備軍用飛機、有二千八百架、亦有脫他多於任何各國者、其次爲美國、有二千六百架﹑意大利有一千八百架、且都是最新型式、英國有一千四百餘架、但其生產速率甚高、可於最短時間﹑擴大一二倍、日本約有一千二百架、且尤注重民間航空、德國有一千一百架、上開數字、僅專指常備軍用飛機而言、如合民用飛機而言﹑其數當更足驚人、其次如巨哥斯拉夫和羅馬尼亞、約有飛機六七百架、波蘭·捷克·約有五六百架、瑞士·比利時·亦有四百餘架、</p>
<p>鐵城有鑒於此、並深慮我國國防建設之空虛﹑曾於兩年前、在上海舉行航空救國運動的宜傳、並以空軍建設，是一種最經濟·最有效·最進步·的國防計劃、且最合於國防落後的中國﹑曾大聲疾呼的主張﹑</p>
<p>要集中令國的智力、來建設空軍﹑要集中全國的財力、來發展空軍、</p>
<p>數年以來、幸　滬上各界人士的贊助、尙能收到相當的效果﹑</p>
<p>現在世變日亟、國難方殷、我們的工作﹑非但應使其繼續發展、且允有加速努力的必要﹑今歲爲蔣委員長五十壽辰、全國各地、都有慕疑購機、呈獻政府﹑以爲蔣委員長五十壽辰的紀念、此種表示、實有兩種深刻重大的意義﹑　是在充實國防、　是在擁戴領袖、</p>
<p>本市認爲此事的重要、所以特自五月起，舉行擴大航空救國的運動、希望各界市民、認識此舉的重要意義之所在、各盡所能、各盡其力、踴躍認捐、來充實我們的國防、來强化民族的力量、來克復當前的國難、來光輝民族的生命﹑二十五年五月十五日、</p>

<h3>從少女會旅行歸來</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>上海婦女敎充館已成立的「少女會」，上個禮拜天往崑山舉行第九决會議，我雖非女性，但也承館長周振韶的特約，參在來賓之列。這次主席兼領隊是胡瑞蟾女士，當大隊人遊玩半繭圜的時候，我就提出了許多問話：「貴會是幾時產生的？旨趣怎樣？有多少會員？局外的少女也可以參加嗎？旅行人數有限制嗎？」</p>
<p>胡女士像個善於經緯的紡織娘，一層層分析給我聽道：「敝會是去年八月間籌備的，九月正式成立。旨趣是借大自然的淸幽環境，一方面旅行，一方面提出預定的題目，大家來討論，好聯絡感情，交換智識，互相督促，共謀進益，希望少女界得到心身雙方的健全和發展。組織很簡單，主席一人，書記二人，大家輪流的推　　任。會員有一百多，陸續有加入的，還不曾統計呢！局外的少女，同樣歡迎參加，只要意識正確，行動光明磊落，肯負起處於非常時期中的救亡責任，而不躁急；不誇張，脚踏實地的先改造好自己，凡有這種精神的，都歡迎。至於會費是很少的。旅行前先把旅行目的地來一個準確的預算，剛好够用就算了，由每次參加旅行的人，事前繳納…，人數也是有沒限定的。……」</p>
<p>這次討論的題目是「服務問題」，我雖然為了攝伊們的問題動態，沒有仔細聽，但長方形桌旁不同的語氣，不同的理由，都好像能抓住「服務一的核心，理論與事實，面面顧到，有儘量發揮的樣子。</p>
<h3>在半繭園門首</h3>
<p>會畢，登山遊覽了，剛下了陣濛濛雨後，走在濘滑的羊腸曲徑上，不怕風雨的艱阻，勇猛的向上移動，不像舊式少女的軟弱，而充分表現着新少女健美的姿態。回來後，於覺得少女們正當的活躍，各地都有提倡的必要</p>
<h3>數字下的美國婦女職業之一斑</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>美國，是一個婦女職業最發達的國家，這是任誰都知道的。但是美國的婦女職業，究竟發達到如何程度？這個問題，很難答復，因爲無處可以覓得相當的統計，以供參考。但據紐約的經濟學家納耳生博士，從一九三一年以來，五年間統計，說的紐約全市，職業婦女，佔全市十六歲至六十歲的婦女的全數的百分之六十九·四，佔全數的三分之二强。約八十七萬左右。（學生除外。）</p>
<p>紐約市是一個商業的中心。因着商業的發達，一切享樂的生活，自然也跟着極度的繁榮。如世界馳名的百老匯，便是紐約的一個大去處。所以在紐約，婦女與職業的分配。店員，（包括售貨員，商店的女書記，銀行行員，各種商店中所雇的廣吿員，兜銷員等，）佔百分之二七·五。舞女，女侍，歌星，影星，播音員，演劇員等，佔百分之一三·七。在工廠中作工，或在家庭　作手工業的，佔百分之八·五。敎育家，佔一·一。醫生，收生，看護等，佔〇·八。敎士等，佔百分之二·〇。在各公共場所及各家庭中，充司炊，洒掃，或撫領小孩的保姆的，佔百分之一三·三。在各國家機關，如交通，市政等局工作的，佔百分之〇·七。服務於各報館，各雜誌，或其他各出版公司，而僅任撰述之職的，佔百分之〇　·六。秘密賣淫的，佔百分之二·二。其他，如法學家，藝術家等，自由職業者，佔百分之九·三。職業不明的，佔百分之三·九其餘是失業的，約佔百分之一六·四</p>
<p>在上述的八十七萬左右的職業婦女中，美國籍的，佔百分之五七·七。歐洲籍的，佔百分之二一·二。中南美，及加那大籍的，佔百分之一二·五。亞洲籍的，佔百分之四·七。其餘是來自菲，澳，各洲的。年齡的分配，十六歲的，佔百分之四·一。一七至二〇歲的，佔百分之一五·二。二一至二五歲的，佔百分之二七·五。二六至三〇歲的，佔百分之二五·八。三一至三八歲的，佔一四·二。三九至五〇歲的，佔百分之九·五。五一至六〇歲的，佔百分之三·七。其間在三十一歲以上的，大部都是法學家，藝術家，國家機關的職員，敎士，醫生，敎員，出版界的撰述員，科學家，設計家，工人，傭役等。店員，女侍，舞女，歌女等，大率都是從十七歲起，至二十五歲之間的。失業者的年齡，在二十六歲至三十八歲之間的，佔最多數，幾佔全部失業人數中的百分之六十七左右。</p>
<p>這八十七萬職業婦女中，大學畢業的，包括得有各級學位者在內，佔全數的百分之七·三。大學未畢業的，佔百分之一一·三。中等學校畢業的，佔百分之四四一。中學未畢業的，佔百分之一四·七。小學畢業的，佔百分之一六·五。小學未畢業的，和未進學樣的，佔百分之六·一。在這全部的職業女子中，已婚的，佔百分之四五·三。結婚之後，離婚，而度着獨身生活的，佔百分之二五·六。這二項中，生有子女的，各佔三分之一左右。未曾結婚的，佔百分之二九·一。至於收入方面，最大的，是每星期五千　百元。最低的，是每星期二十四元，或每月十元。但最普通的，是每星期四十元，至五十元，或每月一百五十元，至二百元，約佔全數的百分之五七·九在這數百以下的，佔百分之八·七。在每星期五十以上至一百元的，佔全數百分之二八·〇。每星期收入，在一百元以上的，佔百分之五·一。至於在一千元以上的，百分之〇·〇一，還弱。而在每星期　十元以下的，也只佔百分之一〇·〇弱。職業婦女，自備汽車的，佔全數的百分之八·七。住在郊外的，佔全數百分之三五·五。其餘住居在市內的，百分之六五·五之中的百分之四七·三，都是公寓裏的。據納耳生氏的調查，全部職業婦女中，置有不動產，或定期存欵，以及實業投資的，佔百分之一二·九。負債的，佔百分之二五·九。經濟情形不明的，百分之一一·三。其他，都是把收入，勉强敷衍着生活而已。</p>
<p>雖然納耳生氏的統計，僅限於紐的地，而其製作統計的根據，只憑着各項零星記載的歸納，並無負貨而有系統的文件，資爲參考，所以他的統計，也未見得是怎麽的可靠，但是從他的統計上的數字瞧來，我們或許也可以略略窺到一些美國第一商業大埠的職業婦女的一斑了。</p>
<h3>自述戀愛的經過</h3>
<p>— 陳林杏雲</p>
<p>一個暮春的早晨。</p>
<p>天空中淡淡的紅霞，漸漸升起，大地上的一切，都被染上了鮮豔的色彩。嫩綠的草兒，似乎睡後方醒，伸伸懶腰，慢慢的直挺。百花帶羞，含苞欲放；鳥雀們都已快樂自在的唱着歌；大自然的四週，充滿着融融的氣象。</p>
<p>在這樣溫暖柔和的大自然的化浴下的他，作了一次十分鐘的深呼吸後，頓時間便振足起了他飽滿的精神，豐潤美麗的面龐，更顯得異常可愛了，從那時起，我剛在初春期熱烈而又衝動的心，就專一的對準了他不斷的追求着。</p>
<p>但是他對於我的追求，絲毫不加以理會　使我受了無限的苦　：也許當時他不是「冷酷」，而是「純潔」，因爲他還只有十六歲。對於「受」的眞義，或許還不會深切的領略，可是我比他長了一歲，却已很迫切的要求着一個：「具有誠摯的態度，豐富的學識，純潔的心靈，堅毅的意志以及康健的身體，勇敢的精神」的男性伴侶了。</p>
<p>他在校中的考試成績，總是常常列在優等，敎師們都對他交口稱饗，許多同學都對了他起着敬仰。他的性情是沉默寡言的，整日間和舊的臉帶着微笑，同學們在書本中有疑問處，拿去與他討論，他總是很謙虛的盡他能力所及，二詳細解答，决不會使你失望，而我呢？在千方百計的引誘他中，最普遍的一法，也就是常常揀出難題來，與他作長時間的講談，有時竟不知不覺間牽及到愛情」方面去，而他却不曾稍稍會意；——我的追求是失敗了他。惡劣的嗜好，他的嗜好，就是讀書，他有不長不短的身材，頭髮向上梳上後再向二邊分開，桃紅色的面龐，生得適中的鼻樑，一個細小的嘴，一顆天眞而又純潔的心，吸引着我留戀不捨的追求着。</p>
<p>男同學的欺侮女同學，是學校中很普遍而且常常發現的現象，但是他却是常常處於中立態度扶助着女同學，男同學用千方百計去討好女同學，甚至廢寢忘餐的日夜思戀着心愛的女同學，這也是男同學受性的苦悶後而數見不鮮的現象，可是他一顆純潔的心，明瞭自身的立塲，專心一志於求學，决沒有這種邪念，來擾亂他的身心，但是我呢？亦有四個男同畢懐着滿腔的熱忱，願意放棄書本追求着我，然而我總以爲有的太粗蠢了，只知單調的追求女性，以爲自己的本務，有的太虛榮了，有的太缺乏學識了，有的太冷酷了，經過我愼重的考慮，他—只有他才是我意中的人，才是我永久的伴侶。</p>
<p>時光一刻不停地進展着，自我追求他到那時，已有半年的時間忽忽的過去了，半年來我的追求成績，依然是毫無所得，但是他的身體，却是高速度的發育着，四尺餘長的身軀，已至五尺左右了，肌肉發達得史堅實了，鮮紅的兩頰，如壯士流出來的血，使我更動情了</p>
<p>夏日炎炎，還留下了它的餘威—射出一錢微弱的光輝—羣爲吱吱，正預備着歸巢，那又是一個夏季的黃昏，在一個小小的庭園，我與他並肩着談笑，忽然間，他向我接了一個吻，並且握了我的手不肯放，帶着感謝的口氣，很親熱的說：</p>
<p>「半年　你對我誠摯的相待，使我深深地感到了你愛情的偉大，是的，世界上是只有善…美…愛：愉快…歡樂的個情感世界，你在追求着我，到了現在，我才領略了你的眞意，我需要你的安慰，我更需要你的鼓勵，我願你作水久的伴侶，最後，我們的前途是燦爛光明。」我的心沸了，我理想中的丈夫，給我如願以償，啊！我是多麽的幸運呀！</p>
<p>二年後，得到雙方家長的允可，就舉行了結婚儀式。</p>
<p>現在，我們在　滬之濱，組織着一個小家庭，彼此間過着甜蜜的夫婦生活。</p>
<h3>馮李德全談婦女救國運動</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>發展蘊藏的能力，恢復天賦的人權，打碎束縛的鍛煉，整個民族纔解放。</p>
<p>南京中山陵附近陵園新邨，是京中維一的淸靜住宅區，據說住戶都是黨國要人，至少是有錢的汽車階級；否則你要住也沒有資格。有一天正是春光明媚的天氣，我也到了新邨，看那一座座新式洋樓，淡黃色的屋宇，襯着紅白相間的花園，四圍一片綠幽幽的松柏，空氣旣然新鮮，景緻又是美麗，的確可愛非凡。這般富麗的洞天福地，不要說居住，就是能得欣賞一番，也有幾分福份呢。在這兒一看，會使你忘紀了一切災荒世亂，甚至於非常的國難，啊！信不信由你。</p>
<p>那天上午，我是去訪問馮玉祥夫人李德全女士的。因爲她是女界中有學識，有經騐，有服務社會的精神，也有處理家政的興趣，想讀者也是久已聞名的。馮夫人借住在陵園新邨的韓公館裏，傳達者通報之後，承欣然接見，我覺得很榮幸。馮夫人態度端莊，說着純熟的北平語，我們談了許多話，從馮氏家庭起，以及馮夫人過去的一切，現時的生活，後來她表示私生活部分，不必談它，只有兩點可以發表出來。這意見切實中肯，足爲現代婦女們的嚮導，敬以吿我申報的讀者。</p>
<p>請問夫人主張中國婦女應如何努力救國工作？</p>
<p>馮夫人沉思一會，便滔滔的說：「婦女天賦的能力並不比男子差，婦女在國家的責任，並不比男子輕，當今國家如此危急，婦女也應當負起救國的責任。但現時中國的婦女，有百分之九十五是不識不知的，這是元氣的荒廢，這是國家巨大的損失。很多人以爲那些不識不知的婦女是沒有能力，那是錯誤的，其實，她們並非沒有能力，而是沒有機會表現她們的能力，她們的能力被埋沒罷了。試看今日蘇聯的婦女，便可證明。即以　意大利稱爲野蠻的阿比西尼的亞婦女來說，當他們的國家被侵略，她們不也是盡力於後防與看護工作嗎？甚至於也慷慨激昂執干戈以衛社稷嗎？每個婦女都有她誠摯愛家的心，要愛家先得愛國，所以也有她熱烈愛國的心：我們要啟發她們，訓練她們，表現她們蘊藏着的赤心，發展她們埋着的能力，恢復她們天賦的人權，替救國工作加上一支生力軍。所以我認爲今日有智識而先覺的婦女，應該切實聯絡生產勞動和農村的婦女」組織起來「訓練起來，盡其可能，擇其所善，共同努力於救國工作」</p>
<h3>馮夫人</h3>
<p>夫人對於婦女運動的意見？</p>
<p>她說：『這問題的範圍太泛，我的意見也太多，現姑就我認爲最重要的談談。過去的婦女運動不過單純的努九於婦女本身解放的工作。婦女本身固應該求解放，但在從事之時我們得看淸楚束縛我們的是些什麽。從前的人都單純的歸罪於社會的歧視與舊道德的壓迫。這兩種固然是束縛我們的桎梏，其實，還有一根束縛我們的鐵練，很多人並沒看到。這根鐵練，不但束縛了婦女，同時束縛了男子，而且束縛了荃體國民，也束縛了　　　家民族。那是什麽，那是帝國主義的侵略。我們若要求婦女本身的整個解放，先得求國家民族整個的解放。我們不但要解除桎梏，還得要破碎鐵練。現在民族沒有眞正的獨立，國家沒有實際的自由，我們民族國家的一部分——婦女——從那裏攫取眞正的獨立與自由？因此，我認爲現時的婦女運動，一方面須努力團結，做解放婦女本身的工作，期在現實社會情况下，求得與男子平等的地位。再一方面，則當隨着社會運動，做解放國家民族的巨大工作！」談了一小時，我想不便再說，而且另有的會，只得稱謝而別。</p>
<h3>婦女的愛美</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>婦女愛美，天性便然，但因各國的社會環境與觀點不同，於是使各國人士對於審美態度，愛美條件亦有出入。譬如日本婦婦，過生日取搽脂抹粉，寬衣大袖，濃裝高　，天足健步以爲美的標準，而西洋婦女，却以束腰長身爲美，菲洲又以黧黑爲美；唯有我國，從前都以裏足束胸的病態爲標準美的。所以西施病心而顰，曾被一般人譽絕世美人，使東施因羨慕其美而欲效其顰，但終於沒有做得像。直至現代則我國婦女則又以截髮長衣，天足放胸以爲美了；於是一般所謂現代婦女，又忙不迭的競相仿效，使從前一般想學張驟華髮光可鑑者，如今盡變了茸茸鬈髮，飄飄短毛。</p>
<p>但，現在的一般婦女，對於審美觀念也各有不同；有的歡喜天然美，有的却愛　裝飾美，所以現代社會上有些所謂摩登婦女，伊們爲了要顯示出美的原故，便都在皮膚上敷了很厚的香粉，面上搽了胭脂，唇邊再塗了一層血似的唇膏，把原有的眉毛剃去了，却畫上一條細長的弧綫，這樣伊們冉上理髮室去將修髮燙鬆得彷彿似一疊一疊的波浪形，腳上穿着一雙一九三六年式的高跟鞋，至於衣服，那當然是綢緞局里的時新料的旗袍或大衣。好像非那樣裝扮，伊們就覺得不能算合了摩登條件，而難顯示出伊們的美麗來。</p>
<p>然而我以爲美，决不是單靠化妝品來粉飾，或衣服來點綴的，其實眞正的美麗，還有它的基本條件在。如：體格的健康，肌肉的發達，身材的適度，輪廓的均勻，舉動的活潑等。</p>
<p>美，雖然是需要修飾的，可是七分生來三分裝，要是沒有基本的美，我相信任是美容有術也難改醜爲妍的。</p>
<p>城市中的婦女靠脂粉美，而鄕村里的婦女却長於天然美，伊們不若都市女性的養尊處優，食玉食而衣錦衣，揮霍享樂；伊們大都在自己家庭中服役，除了日常操勞家務，撫育兒女外，也帮着丈夫到田地中去。伊們每天運動工作，早起早睡，所以能够使身體健康，發育均衡，而另有一種布衣荊釵的樸　美。况且鄕村里的婦女多純樸天眞，愛悄專一，溫柔可親，絕不會像那些摩登女性的崇尙虛榮，矯揉做作。但缺點也長有的，像缺乏衛生常識，對於生理攝生不知修養；所以往往有些鄕村婦女，會將自己美破壞，或生理發育成為畸形變態。然而我們要補救這些缺點，還須注意下列幾點：不使受絲毫壓迫或損害，如睡眠，飮食，衣服等。　發除一切有害婦女身體的裝飾術或裝飾品，如束胸，纏足。……　臉面的顏色要有血氣，有生意，精神煥發，顯出自然的柔嫩和美麗，不宜多用脂粉搽敷。　要注意日常攝生，凡富有刺激性的食物不可吃，如烟酒酸辣之物。　一切過於狹窄緊小的衣服鞋帽不要穿戴，一切有害發育和損壊健康的裝飾品不應採用</p>
<p>美固重於自然，但也需要修養和裝飾的帮助。可這種裝飾重在本身整理，日常攝生，却不單靠於化妝品，所以凡現代的愛美婦女，不可不知此基本的美容常識。</p>
<h3>世界各地婦女的動態（上）</h3>
<p>— 維經</p>
<p>詩家谷主婦俱樂部</p>
<p>美國詩家谷，於去年二月間，創一主婦俱樂部。發起者，為該地的克林姆生銀行行長勃魯斯氏的夫人。發起的動機是自已威到治家智識的缺乏，於是想組織這麼個俱樂部，集高尙家庭中的主婦們於一室，互相切磋商討各項家庭問題，如經濟的支配，傭僕的駕御，兒童的管理，衛生的設施，娛樂的追求等等。規定每月聚餐一次，以資會晤。此項聚餐會，非在特殊的狀態之下，須於各會員家庭中舉行，以便各會員，得有互相參觀他人的家庭，以爲借鏡的機會。會所就設在勃魯斯夫人的家裏。最初成立時，僅有會員七人，但至去年年終時，已增加至二十二人。預定俟會員增至五十人時，將另租會所，而將這種組織，擴至全國各地</p>
<h3>新女性</h3>
<p>奧京籌設小女恊會</p>
<p>奧京維也納，近有一名女伶，發起組織少女協會。該女伶，名維脫羅斯萊，今年已五十歲。在十年之前，是奧京的惟一紅女伶，積資甚富。現因年老色衰，已脫離舞臺生活，而努力於慈善事業，所以伊所發起的少女恊會，也是以舉辦慈善事業爲職志的。據伊的發表，擬於該會成立時，以其資產的三分之二，捐贈該會，爲基金。所需舉辦的工作，爲籌建平民醫院，籌設流浪見童收養所，盲啞俱樂部，指撥貧苦見童獎學金等。每一會員，入會時，須一次交付入會費的四十金鎊。每年，須捐助會費十至二十五金鎊。該會每年擬舉行籌欵遊藝會二次或三次。凡屬會員，均須推銷入場券，及參加服務之義務。自維脫羅斯萊發表該計劃之後，加入者，已有三十餘人，幾全部均屬該國之有地位的婦女，故前途頗可樂觀。</p>
<h3>談談婦女職業</h3>
<p>— 勿戈</p>
<p>在中國談婦女職業問題，眞有點可憐。</p>
<p>雖然，男女平等的呼聲鎮天在高唱着，可是，政府機關，大商店裏，以及各種行業的女職員，却被人稱爲「花瓶」，那是實事。</p>
<p>難道婦女不能做事嗎？那不，農村裏的婦女。</p>
<p>機器間的女工，學校裏的女敎員，伊們不是成天成年的出賣伊們的能力，爲着社會服務嗎？</p>
<p>雖然，似乎社會是男人的，就是伊們出盡了伊們的能力，但，伊們所得到的報酬，却不能贍養伊自己的生活，終於要依靠男人而生活，那樣婦女的職業，就給男人所操縱了。</p>
<p>近來，農村經濟破產，向來靠着農村生活的人們，給不景氣的狂潮，衝破了他們的生命錢。</p>
<p>於是感到農村不能佔足了，就一批一批的走向各個繁盛的都會來。從農村跑出來的婦女，在都會裏，伊們們只能做女工傭婦，但·那是多麽微小的收入啊</p>
<p>並且，大都會受世界不景氣影響，大公司成年的在大减價，工廠一間一間的倒閉，失業羣一日一日的增加，在大都曾不容易生活呵！</p>
<p>所以，那無知的婦女們，受着生活的驅使，受着虛榮的誘惑，伊們就忍痛地出賣身體，出賣人格，而走上黑暗的地獄去了。</p>
<p>那樣子，大都會就出現了許多畸形的婦女職含糊不清。</p>
<p>在街頭的燈柱邊，你可以看到賣肉生涯的娼妓，在期待伊的主顧。在音樂悠揚的舞塲，你可以看到供人摟抱的舞女。在按摩院裏，女人會給你洗操的。在某個秘密塲所，你可以看到女人們赤裸着在表演各種秘戲。各種各樣的女人，過着非人的生活，在做着男人們的玩具，那是多麼悲慘的婦女職業呵！</p>
<p>但，一般躱在家庭的主婦們，小姐們，伊們有男人的供奉，不愁穿，不愁食，鎭天的在過着舒適的幸福的生活，在伊們閒着的時候爲着取媚供奉伊的男人起見，伊們毫無痛惜用多量的錢，買高貴的化妝品，衣飾，打扮得花枝招展似的，以取得男人們的愛悅。那樣，伊們就成了男人的附物，社會的蠹虫！伊們决不會想到伊在社會上應負的責任，也不會想到那羣在生命綫上掙扎着，過着非人生活的姊妹們，那是多麽可憐的沒靈魂的女人呵！</p>
<p>婦女們，在那非常時期，你們該覺悟了，你們該同男人一樣的負起救亡的責任，你們該認淸了目標，打開條新的出路。</p>

<h3>一種不合理的事實</h3>
<p>— 冉人</p>
<p>—一個書店職員的解嘲</p>
<p>甲　好久不見，你們的圖書館想來一定有許多新發展了！</p>
<p>乙　難得今天遇見你，我正有許多對於疑問要請敎接近書店的朋友。你知道我們的圖書館與一般圖書館是不同的。一般的圖書館不見得有多少固定的讀者，我捫是一羣讀者爲着自己急切的需求而組設起來的。所以我們對於出版界的要求格外的深切，好像有一種特別的敏感似的。我捫感覺到我國出版界與讀書界的「圖書恐慌」正在一天一天的深刻。我首先問你，你們書店究竟打着什麽主意，爲什麽大家拼命的翻古董，竟不管多數求知靑年的需要？</p>
<p>甲　你提出的問題太跋重了，我是一個小書店的中級職員，不配代表出版界來答復你這個大問題。但是這問題與我的職業有密切的關係，我很願意和你討論一番。我願意把我所知出版界的消息報吿給你，也算是「拋磚引玉」，好多多領敎你的高見。現在先要請你解釋，方才你說的我國出版界與讀書界的圖書恐慌是什麽意思？</p>
<p>乙　「圖書恐慌」這名詞原是我杜撰的，脫胎於「糧食恐慌」道個名詞。適合求知靑年需要的良好讀物，我們不是稱爲「智識的食糧」的嗎？現在各書店你爭我奪的在那兒翻印舊書，我認爲這種耗費印刷物力的趨勢不把他急速挽救過來，所謂「智識的食糧」大有發生恐慌之可能。近年來很少見關於社會科學自然科學以及文學藝術的重要著作和譯本出版，已是一個很顯明的預兆啊！</p>
<p>甲　你對於出版界的不滿，我亦有同感。我也認爲這個翻印古書的風氣不把他改變過來，是我國出版界自就毀滅。但是我並不是因爲做了書店夥計就要爲書店老闆辯護，據我所知這個翻印古書的風氣的造成，也是逼上梁山，是有他的客觀的原因的。</p>
<p>乙　書店老闆要翻印古書有客觀的原因，這是很巧妙的辯護吧！我認爲書店老闆不應該惟利是圖，應該以文化爲前提。多出些適合求知靑年需要的讀物，可以推進文化。推進文化之後就可以推廣他的出版物的銷路。我要勸書店老闆們把眼光放得達一點，不要一眼看準了有閑錢來買他們的什麽集成什麽備耍等大部書者的荷包，替他們揮霍印刷物力，把那些知識慾極强的窮靑年們放在一邊，睬也不睬。要知道客觀的情形是有閑錢買大部書的買了書並不看的，只是放在旁邊做裝飾。智識慾極强的窮靑年買了幾本需要的書簡直是當飯吃一般的認眞閱讀的。漠視了道種很可注意的客觀情形，來宣傳翻印古書的客觀原因，小別經年，想不到老兄已經被養成爲一個書店標準店員了，恭喜，恭喜！哈哈，朋友太熟了，見面就抬槓，抱歉，抱歉，請不要見氣！</p>
<p>甲　你是有感而言，我早已聲明與你同感，只是你的脾氣喜歡搶白，老朋友彼此相知，有什麼見氣，不過沒有問淸楚有什麼原因，就把另外一種客觀的事實來發揮，這却是我們討論問題不應該有的態度。</p>
<p>乙　這是我的不是，對不起，敢問書店老闆要翻印古書有什麽客觀的原因？</p>
<p>甲　什麼客觀的原因，說來非常簡單。只是我方才聽你的一番議論，覺得有一個觀念不大正確應該放棄，否則你聽了我的話又要以我爲强辯，再來一回搶白，反而捉不到這個問題的核心。</p>
<p>乙　請敎。</p>
<p>甲　豈敢！你說書店老闆不應該惟利是圖，應該以文化爲前提。我覺得你這個觀念不大正確。</p>
<p>乙　恕我搶白。你的意思是不是書店老闆應該惟利是圖，不必以文化爲前提？這倒是爲書店老闆絕好的辯護！</p>
<p>甲　我並不爲書店老闆辯護，也不須爲他們辯護。我的意思是這樣：如果希望書店老闆不惟利是圖，專以文化爲前提，那是一種不正確的觀念。我並不是說書店老闆祇要惟利是圖，不必顧到文化。但，倘使一味祇顧文化，把利不利完全漠視，那也决不是書店，這正和老兄不能餓了肚子去替社會服務一樣的道理。</p>
<p>乙　我還不大明白，還要請你說明一下。我總覺得你是在替書店老闆辯護。</p>
<p>甲　不錯，我在你過分的責備書店老闆的一點上，是有些替書店老闆辯護的意思的。但是與其說我在替書店老闆辯護，不如說在勸你不要過分的抬高書店老闆的身分。書店老闆是商人，對着商人敎他放棄商業行爲，以文化爲唯一的目的，這上什麼話！</p>
<p>乙　那末所謂書店老闆翻印古書的客觀原因究竟是什麼呢？</p>
<p>甲　要知道翻印古書的客觀的原因，就不可不先知道少印新書的客觀的原因。第一，新書的來源，是要靠著作家的供給。現在的中國，祇有寥寥可數的幾個着作家，靠他們寫出來的字數，究屬有限。而且，因爲書籍的銷路不廣，定價低廉，書店里出不起高的稿費，略許有點本領的人，情願去從事政治活動，那個肯去埋頭筆硯裏面，等着稿費來買米下鍋。著作家也便因之愈少。至於舊書，因爲幾千年來的著作家，替他們寫得很多，又用不着出稿費，可以予取予携，倘使你做了書店老闆，請想，還是印新書便利，還是印老書便利？</p>
<p>乙　第二呢？</p>
<p>甲　第二呢麽？政府的出版法，對新書的出版，束縛得很嚴，動不動就有禁止發行或處罰的危險。而且，凡是會經禁止發行或處罰的書，實際上往往是銷路比較好，稿費比較大一點的書。書店吃過幾决虧，對於新書自然不敢放胆印行，倒不如印行舊書可以自由自在，受不着出版法的束縛。</p>
<p>乙　還有第三麽？</p>
<p>甲　第三是，中國的著作權法，雖然已經施行了好多年，但實際的效力，好像還是薄弱得很。一部新書出版，倘使銷路比姣的好，翻印書商就立刻會巷你翻印，用極低廉的定價同原版書競爭，買的人祇曉得便宜，那里管到什麼翻板不翻板。至於銷數不好的新書，在書店也許祇能賠錢。因此，新書的出版，也便受到極大的打擊。</p>
<p>乙　這不能算是一種原因，還祇怪書店的貪圖厚利。倘使他們的定價，也和翻板書一樣的便宜，那個還再要翻印？</p>
<p>甲　老兄究竟還是書生，沒有懂得商塲的情形。出版商怎能和翻板商去競爭呢？一則翻板商不要出什麼稿費校對費；二則這些人都是小組織，用不到像出版商那樣大的開銷；所以一個定價一元，剛剛够本，一個定價五角反可購錢。至於翻印舊書，祇要定價低，銷路天，一點不用稿費等等的開銷，當然可以比新書有有利了。</p>
<p>乙　還有第四種原因沒有呢？</p>
<p>甲　第四種原因，可以說是最重大的原因。老兄懂得經濟學上需要和供給的法則摩？倘使社會上沒有某種的需要，當然决不會有某種的供給；供給本來是從需要產生的。中國目前的思想界，比起五四運動時候來，好像已經隔世。活動一點的分子，往往遭遇危險。一方面政治當局，提倡讀經尊聖；一方面文人學士，又在提倡什麽晚明的閒適文學。怕事一點的讀書人，樂得鑽在故書堆裏去寄託心情，遠災避禍，這是需要之一。還有，經濟的恐慌，使得要讀書的人，買不起書；爲了暫充智識的飢餓，廉價的舊書，因此便乘隙而入。這是需要之二。這些都是極嚴重的問題，决不能完全歸罪到書店老闆的唯利是圖的。</p>
<p>乙　聽了你這一番話，我雖不得不承認你有理由，但總覺得讓這種不合理的事實存在並且發展下去是不能安心的。難道你們眞是沒有方法糾正麽？</p>
<p>甲　糾正的責任，要全靠在書店老闆身上，恐怕是不可能的。思想的飯動，市面的振興，那裏是一部分的人所能為力。我們競自己力量所及，祇有儘可能範圍以內，多出新書的時候，竭力來加以嚴密的選擇，仔細的整理，使得可以供現在學衛界的取材，不要開時代的倒車，替復古運動的人來推波助瀾，那就算盡應盡的責任了。</p>
<h3>我怎樣遊歷太平洋一周</h3>
<p>— 金仲華</p>
<p>寫在「太平巡禮」的前面</p>
<p>在近年來，而於遠東局勢的緊急，我們特別注意到太平洋上的一切。遠東的危局激動了太平洋上的風雲，太平洋一的風雲又增進了遠東的危急：這兩者間是相互關連着的。在太平洋周圍有不少强大勢力和弱小民族，它們都受到了遠東問題——具體地說，是中國問題——的深切影響。强者爲要擴張勢力，無限制地在太平洋四岸和洋面上進行掠奪；弱者受到凌虐，有的被剝奪了生機，有的正在作生的掙扎。於是太平洋上的種種變化迅速地展開了：舊的城市被建成了新的，小小的港灣被改作巨大的軍站，許多一向不受人注意的小島被收了去，用作海軍根據地或燃料姑，而軍艦和飛機的游弋演戰，更打破了太平洋上的沉寂。</p>
<p>這一切的一切，引起了我們無限的注意。我個人常常想中國人應該把眼張大些，把目光放遠些，看看外面這一切變化的情形。我們不能在閉關的靜默中待死，却應在廣大的變動中求生！</p>
<p>於是，我打算着往太平洋四岸遊歷一周，把一切觀察得更具體些。</p>
<p>但是，我憑什麼力量來開始這個遊歷呢？巨大的旅費我籌不到。太平洋四周的港埠間還有種種政治的，經濟的，文化的以至交通上的隔閡，這樣的遊歷並不是易事。這使我不得不在對於這個廣大洋面的遐想中，轉着別的念頭。無論如何，我要照我的幻想去遊歷一下。最後我的决定：是用地圖作指南針，用書本作爲遊程中的輪船和車輛，用報章雜誌作爲沿途的食糧。</p>
<p>這樣，經過相當時候的準備，我開始這個有系統的遊歷了。沿路我就寫下這巡禮的印象記來。</p>
<p>關於這個巡禮的印象記，我也費了相當工夫的安排。我要使它像一個完全眞實的旅行記，但又不願它成爲那種單純的祇寫沿路風物和瑣屑事項的旅行記。我定下了一個大綱的計劃，照這計劃寫下去。</p>
<p>我把每一個到過的地方畫一幅地圖；不是關於這地方的詳細圖，而是這個地方在太平洋岸的形勢的簡明圖。例如關於上海我所畫的地圖在於說明它是「中國的門戶」；海參威我要說明它是「蘇聯遠東防禦的最前線」；巴拿馬運河，在地圖上顯出它是「兩個大洋間的橋樑」；夏威夷羣島，它的地位形勢恰像「太平洋中的直布羅陀」。在這些局部的地圖之外，我也預備了兩幅關於整個太平洋的地圖，把太平洋上列强的勢力圈和各要點之問的距離，都顯示出來。</p>
<p>我希望這個記述不單是橫斷面的，而且要縱剖面的。所以對於太平洋上各帝國主義勢力的發展，弱小民族土地的被掠奪，每一個港埠或軍事根據地怎樣經過許多鬭爭的波折，最後落在某一個國家的手中，被「開發」「建設」起來，我也二寫出它們的歷史的背景。我想，這樣不但可以幫助大家明白太平洋沿岸各地的情形，而且也可以指出太平洋上政治演變的趨向，給我們認識一些歷史的敎訓。</p>
<p>此外，我所注意的自然是各地的民族生活，經濟鬭爭，特別是軍略上的布置情形。關於這些，我儘量採用了新近的報章雜誌材料。最近四五年來遠東激變所引起太平洋岸各地的尖銳　爭，和以前的許多年眞是大不相同了。每年·每月·每天，都在發展變化，舊日的史地記載都不足够了，我們要把這些新的史地資料儘速記錄下來。這些現實的知識，可以增加我們對於當前國際形勢的認識，促進我們民族的醒覺，也加强了我們對於萬分危急的現狀的應付力量。</p>
<p>我在一九三五年初開始這個遊歷，到一九三六年中方才結束：這期間正是太平洋上，特別是我們中國，變化得最劇烈的時候。華盛頓條的巳經被撕毀了，帝國全義的軍備競爭巳經公開進行了，弱小民挨的當頭厄運是益加嚴重了；在中國，華北的分割事實上已經完畢，而華南的分割也漸趨於表面化。我們民族要怎樣才能在這個帝國主義張牙舞爪的時代生存下去呢？我願以這個小小的冊子的出版，促起國人的猛醒！</p>
<h3>介紹「魯濱孫飄流記」</h3>
<p>— 兪惠仁</p>
<p>美國敎育家史密斯氏在前進的敎育裏說：「無疑地，親愛的父母們，現在你我延績着世界的生命，負荷着文化的重担，和那些偉大的計劃，周詳的設施，對於自然的經營控制，不久將要隨年輪而衰息，而寂滅了。繼我們存在而活動的，只有今日的兒童。」</p>
<p>「兒童是未來的母親」。我們的責務之一，是在那裏爲後代培養人才，顧到子孫的幸福，訓練他們，使他們將來勇敢地，聰明地應付各種公私問題，毫無躊躇地犧牲小已，高潔地成功立業。但欵獲得還種性格，我捫非使兒童早日受完美的敎育不可。完美的敎育雖有許多種類，但供給充分適當的兒童讀物的敎育，確是其中之一。爲甚麽呢？因爲兒童讀物是「兒童精神的糧食一。他具有許多可以啓發涵養兄童心性的各要素的力量。</p>
<p>兒童的習慣中最與成功和愉快有關的，就是閱讀的習慣。道是很顯明的，缺少了閱讀的習慣，非但限制了他應得的知識，而且還阻礙了他能力的發展。</p>
<p>在這個意義上，近來我國對於兒童讀物的出版非常興盛，眞是可喜的現象。但我們所引爲遺憾的，是這些兒童漩物中能給人益處的，却實在少得很。大都是忽略了兒童的心理，僅僅漠然地隨便弄幾本出版而已。所以，皇帝公主，神仙鬼怪，以及意識歪曲的幾乎本本都是。倘把這些讀物爲「兒童精神的糧食」，則我們文化的和民族的前途，一定都不堪設想了。</p>
<p>兒童是靈活的心的活動者。由這意思，我才介紹魯濱孫飄流記爲兒童的「精神糧食」，想必爲許多人所喜歡；但也許有人以爲這是一件舊作品（十八世紀的產物），好像穿舊的衣服，沒有新的美，也沒有新的樂趣，而不値得介紹了。</p>
<p>魯濱孫飄流記是一部世界知名的兒童讀物，爲男孩子們第七本所喜讀的書。內容講着一個名呌魯濱孫的人，在航海的途中遇了險，飄流到一個無人的荒島上；他在荒島上完全發揮了他人類的智能，幹下了一種類乎我們的社會的事業。他在這個荒島上一共住了二十八年多，在這悠長的歲月裏，他十足顯示了英雄的氣質。故事雖然是小說家所虛搆出來的，但描寫却是很近於眞實的。</p>
<p>關於魯濱孫飄流記的譯本，我國已有好幾種了，的有四五種之多吧。我現在所想介紹的是顧均正唐錫光兩先生的節譯本。我爲什麽要介紹這佃譯本，而不介紹別的譯本呢？我覺得牠和其他譯本不同的有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，牠沒有把「感謝上帝聖靈」「感謝上帝對我的慈悲」那種宗教思想全盤搬過來灌輸到小朋友的腦袋裏去。在魯濱孫飄流記裏宗敎的意味是十分濃厚的。魯濱孫的一舉一動，以及一件事業的成敗，他都得感謝上帝的慈悲，和祈求上帝的憐憫。作爲「兒童精神的糧食」的兒童讀物的文藝書籍，不但要估量牠的文藝價値，同時還耍估量牠的敎育價値。宗敎思想在敎育上的價値，有識者是都知道的。</p>
<p>第二，牠雖是節譯本，可是沒有把書中重要的描寫略去，使牠只剩下一連串情節；換句話說，牠沒有把這部小說改爲故事，却依舊還牠小說的本來面目。魯濱孫飄流記在我國已有四五種譯本，有的是據原文全譯，有的是根據原文的事實，演譯爲故事，失去了原作的精髓。顧唐的節譯本却依據敎育原理和兒童心理，把其中不適宜於兒童的部分逐一刪去，使牠成爲很有敎育價値的東西。書中文字仍保持了笛福的原作的精神。</p>
<p>第三，牠從複雜的叙事中整理出一個條理淸楚的章次，每章各有扼耍的題名，旣便記憶，復易翻檢。</p>
<p>第四，牠附有六十餘幅美麗的插圖，其畫面之佈置，及人物之表情，均足補書中未盡之意，這雖然是一個附帶的問題，但在目下我國的兒童讀物上還占着極重要的地位呢。</p>
<p>魯濱孫顠流記雖是件舊作品，但牠還是富有滋養，給人益處的，這個節本更完成了牠的敎育價値；我希望讀者一面鑒賞着這特色，一面懐着涵養廣博的智識，和高尙情操的心情，來讀這一本書。我想，你們的見聞就會更廣，更深，精神也因此磨鍊出來了。</p>

<p>編者案：上年開明書店編印二十五史，於舊有二十四史外，加入曾由政府列爲正史之柯劭忞氏「新元史」，俾成全史：並與柯氏繼承人訂立契約，取得出版權。不久即有譚天者，虛設「書報合作社」字號，登報發售所謂二十六史」預約，同時並圖翻印「新元史」。經柯氏繼承人憑內政部註冊執照，向上海第一特區地方法院，訴譚天侵害著作權，經法院判决，禁止翻印。譚天復以此書經政部列爲正史，柯氏不應享有著作權，並指會經徐氏退耕堂刋行爲著作人自願任人翻印，請內政部撤消該書註冊，內政部因列舉疑義，函請最高法院解釋。茲經司法院統一解釋法令會議議决解釋如上。足證「新元史」在法律上確有著作權，下容侵書。當訴訟進行時，頗有以譚天所持之理由爲正當而寄與同情者。今譚天已以捲取預的欵逃匿，被控詐欺取罪，經法院裁定通緝，一般社會，當可潦然於此事之眞相矣。</p>

<h3>證券　大戶多頭紛紛出籠　公債跌風驟起</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、又忽起意外跌風、與週三之意外漲風、適成反比例、華北增兵、以及其他謠言紛起、惟市價之所以搖動如此之　者、實以適逢卅五號多頭、正在陸續出籠、經此乃賣出更湧、跌風劇烈時、若非十一號及七十二號大量買進、跌風當益加厲、形勢之惡、由於適在抬高時期、故易於奔瀉、謠言如何、雖尙不能證實、但縱不實在、市價亦不易即因收盤之稍堅而轉漲、暫時殊難抱樂觀、昨日經過、上午兩盤平疲、已有不振之象、卅五號緩緩出籠、四號卅四·及卅七號均有賣出、雖有十一及三十二以及四十八號之買進、終以三十五號之多頭出籠、多有具有戒心、故兩盤陸續趨跌、已小去三五六角不等、午後謠言驟起、開盤形勢、頗形嚴重、賣氣之盛、首推三十五號、餘如四號二十三及三十七號等、賣出亦極踴躍、全賴十一號及七十二號等奮勇買進、得一部份支持之力、然又已跌去三五角至七角半不等、收盤散戶稍有抵補、三十四及七十七號稍有買進、而三號十六及三十七號等、仍在賣出、市價雖已回堅二三角、但係臨時之小回風、不可認爲趨勢已轉、市價結果、小五角半至八角半不等、九六亦小一二角、成交總數、共計七百二十七萬五千元、以第三盤爲最多、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　投機熱狂　紗市風浪正多　籌碼日增…升降愈大</h3>
<p>近來紗市忽升忽降、上氣勢在暴、使人殊難捉摸、來勢異常凶猛、殊覺可畏、市場人心之熱烈、達於沸點、一般投機商心神不定、籌碼日增、因此波瀾在大、前市漲勢仍烈、午後聞證券下落、謠詠紛紜、市價下瀉、繼以空頭抵補而轉平定耳</p>
<p>大昌成午前照市拖進</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以多方有一部分出　消息、賣者較增、市價　跌八·九角至一元五·六角、二盤以後、因中美貨幣協定之事議論紛紛、見仁見智、各有不同、買風又起、市價緩步上昇、迨至三收盤大昌成突來照市拖進、爲額甚夥、已達一萬包以外、於是檯面又覺乾涸、但合興出檔亦巨、市價狂跳一元九角至八·九角、結角近月比上日收盤價均漲一元·二角、遠漲二·五·七角、午後開盤、近忽跌七·八角至一元、二盤開拍、市場情形轉變、謠言孔繁、公債下落、賣氣奇濃、市况急轉直下、惟大昌成仍來吸收、各月跌一元以外、迨至三收盤、有一部分空頭抵補、路形回昇一元外、但拍至十月期、又跌二角、結果各月比上午收盤均跌六·八·九角至一元、惟本月勿動、查賣出德大一千一百五十包、聚興二千包、裕康六百五十包、達記二千七百五十包、合興八千六百包、賡豐二千二百包、元二千包、長豐二千四百包、潤康二千一百包、生源二千三百包、經華一千三百五十包、明德一千一百包、仁豐一千包義成一千〇五十包、同和一千九百包、買進大孚二千六百包、通記一千八百五十包、裕大二千三百包、愼昌二千七百包、愼記二千五百包、錦昌二千包、信誠二千三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>紗銷仍在千包外</p>
<p>現紗銷路尙堪維持、查全日各帮買去統計一千一百八十五包、售價平平、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>流言左右棉花</h3>
<p>棉市始漲繼跌、形勢殊覺錯雜、晨初因中美貨幣協定問題、買者雲集而挺、近月多方收貨風說極盛、遠期帶上、午後因謠言不佳、轉趨下挫在三日中比低價時已漲二元外、或有一度反動、</p>
<p>明德合與大批吐出</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、多方有一部分吐出、於是市場跟賣者、超過其二三倍、各月均跌二·三·四角、形態較虛、但入後以紗市良好、利多傳言復熾、並有多方準備在本月收貨、預備裝運外埠銷售、於是買氣濃烈、市價步開步挺、但明德合興猛批吐出、結果近月比上日收盤價計漲四角、遠月漲五分至一角、午後開盤、市場流言復起、謂中美貨幣問題、路透電有否認說、於是賣風陡起、市盤急轉直下、各月均跌三角半至五角、查賣出聚興三千擔、德大一千七百擔、裕康三千五百擔、明德一萬二千五百擔、合興八千六百擔、義成五千八百擔、益昶二千三百擔、大昶二千九百擔、大豐二千三百擔、賡豐一千六百擔、長和四千五百擔、澄記一千三百擔、泰昌一千四百擔、買進裕大四千擔、愼昌六千八百擔、瑞大二千四百擔、愼記五千三百擔、仁豐一千六百擔、泰昌二千七百擔、長豐四千九百擔、生源七千三百擔、永大二千八百担、益康七千一百担、新昶二千七百担、信誠三千五百担、潤康二千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>花產　甚動</p>
<p>現棉消費、尙稱不薄、廠胃仍健、來源姚花二百包云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、此間與加拿大作物狀况均優、人心看小、恐僅能反動回高而無大漲之望、</p>
<h3>海外棉價一致上升</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、史密斯案通過、天氣續好、消費增大、各月漲一至七磅音、其後股市有力、外商活動買進近月、尤以十月爲最、華爾街亦有買進、致套賣之額、均被吸收、囤棉處經紀人售出四月期的萬包、五月期在一角一分六釐時、亦有售出、最後華爾街再度買進、市價又升、計現貨漲三磅音、期貨漲三至十六磅音、英棉現貨漲四點，期貨漲三至七點、印棉因美棉史密斯案通過、股市有力、投機家及歐洲出口商買進而堅、計平果爾漲一·五羅比、奧姆辣漲一·五至二·五羅比、白羅溪漲一·五至二羅比、原電錄左、（十四日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十五日七八月期白羅溪花開盤預測、爲二百零二羅比、較上日漲一·七五羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花俱漲</h3>
<p>十五日大阪電、三品期紗漲四角至一元四角、近月爲一百九十六元、遠月爲一百九十六元四角、期棉漲二角至六角、近月爲六十四元、遠月爲六十元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布實銷轉佳　市盤亦稍堅挺</h3>
<p>棉布爲紗花漲風所帶起、業中人鑑於中美幣制恊定幾已締結、布價前途有高漲之可能、然觀察棉布銷路之日見緊縮、又不免寒心、故買氣並未大濃、昨日市盤堅挺、實銷頗佳、烟台靑島帮進大生廠十六磅三星粗布三百餘件、色貨辦去達豐廠四喜牌、光中廠湘妃牌、公勝廠風行脾、慶豐廠慶豐圖、素府綢三十餘箱爲最多、其餘匯裕成新廠標準色布、鴻章廣雙鳳縐地呢等貨十餘件、日商行家開出本月期十一磅藍日細布一百件、價又提高二分半、粵漢平津諸大帮進胃淡薄、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經交易寥無幾　洋莊銷路又吿停頓</h3>
<p>本埠絲市、月初頗爲堅俏、歐美銷售頗夥、然未及旬餘、因法匯突縮、日絲傾跌、洋莊絲市、又告停頓、昨日紐的生絲微漲、橫濱續跌、里昂絲價淸疲、申埠絲市猶難起色、用戶絲市亦吿寂然、昨日僅聞內地某用戶進粗條份白廠B字五包、價六九○元云、</p>
<h3>人造絲昨又有標賣　爲興昌號獨家購進價三百十餘元</h3>
<p>此次本埠江海關標賣之人造絲（計三五·六四一·五九磅、合一百七十八箱餘）、已於昨日上午十時開標、因各方劇烈爭購、標價異常高昂、結果爲本埠興昌號獨家購得、價三百十餘元、</p>
<p>一百二十號天橋牌私貨、價未動、爲三百零數元、成交十餘箱、無光絲走銷尙佳、七十五號及一百號缺貨、日貨無光絲、光色呆鈍、染色不勻、故銷路不敵歐貨、</p>
<h3>綠茶市面突轉沉寂</h3>
<p>我國綠茶對外貿易、向特法屬摩洛哥爲大宗、近日謠傳法國法郞貶價、此間英法茶商、大感不安、搶辦新貨觀念、爲之頓挫、市面突趨沉靜、路莊遂安珍眉綠茶、昨各茶棧·雖已陸續運到七八百箱、但歐莊行家、進意非常冷淡、市情殊堪注目、土莊珍　、僅祇抽芯貨、略有零星走銷、躉莊交易、亦趨寥落、市盤繼續降低三四元、形勢頗爲不利云、</p>
<h3>祁門紅茶運到千餘箱</h3>
<p>門新紅茶、近兩日來、陸續運滬、　有千餘箱、日內尙有大批這到、聞下墨期當有新貨佈樣推銷云、</p>
<h3>湖州新茶盛銷　價較上年高十元</h3>
<p>今庚湖州新綠茶、前當產區上市之際、適滬市新茶開盤後高莊貨銷路尙佳、是以銷路大暢、售盤提高至五十元關外、扯價較上年高十元、日來福昌隆公升等茶廠均有大宗裝運到滬、比即開工趕製云、</p>
<h3>辦茶洋行新添一家</h3>
<p>近有丹麥商、在江西路福時洋行樓上、開設　隆洋行一所專辦各路茶葉業已通知各茶棧一體送樣云、</p>
<h3>糧食　天晴粉市看疲</h3>
<p>昨日紛市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先穩後疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿美兩盧祇好四分、小則一角零、當開價時、六月份以多空爭競、趨勢尙穩、惟七月份開始、則市氣一致不穩、因天時欠佳、人心看疲、且火廠方面、仍續有套售、故市氣步鬆、市塲又謠傳津關發生問題、將來申粉去化、勢必更受打擊、是以賣方彷彿重入優勢矣、迨至下午關盤、各月份交易、已轉淸淡、市氣雖續不振、惟跌度已差、因目下如廠拋增加、市面當　萎　、否則未看過疲云、</p>
<h3>期麥內地帮拋賣不絕　市盤回跌八九分</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份一致軟弱、因天時見佳、各路新麥報吿、尙未受久雨之影響、並以粉市經廠家拋售、未能穩固、因各月份喊價即軟落三五分不等、至內地帮交易、亦逐步套賣、故市場情形、已不若前之岑寂矣、迨至下午開盤、六月份交易無多、價續軟弱、七月份以下因粉市不振、又落三四分、此得如得天宮晴帳、尙看續軟、現麥市情、廠家仍多觀望、高貨南市喊開四元七角、祇三四百包進出云、</p>
<h3>客秈猶本街去路　洋米到存雖稀市價亦被帶軟</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不旺、惟行販客團之存米尙充、以天氣漸熱、不能久擱、莫不爭先求售、身骨中次者更願貶價脫手、故昨市各米續見回小三五分、洋米到存雖微、而市價亦被客秈帶軟、去路仍以本街爲主、內地客帮略有應酬、全日開出贛米二千六百包、湘米三百包、溫台米八百八十五包、小絞米一百包、後市形勢看軟、須有本客整票去化、方能站住、否則尙有逐步修削之必要、蓋天熱後大部份客秈不能擱置云、</p>
<h3>白粳店銷稍動</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、祇到十餘號、貨共近四千石、內中薄稻較多、本街銷場仍呆、大連稱則辦薄稻千餘包、故厚早粳市續慘幾分、薄稻行情無榮辱、杜洋尖帶軟、陰變元平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源廿三四號、市上各種銷場、白粳店胃銷動、市形平定、薄稻堆拆平常、價稍帶軟勢、變元零拆滯細、價小近角、羊杜客尖及其餘各貨、價均和平、</p>
<h3>洋莊芝麻滯銷續跌　黃豆祇有零星交易</h3>
<p>洋莊芝蔴因國外情形疲弱、交易寂寞已久、市况步向下游、昨由英商洋行辦去一百五十噸、價開十二元四角、比較前市跌六角、前途　勢尙　疲軟、黃豆銷場、祇有內地帮及本街零星去路、行情高平决辱、共計做開車輪各豆三千餘包、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白成交增多</h3>
<p>昨售出五羊粗白一千二百餘包</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平定、走銷略呈活動、故粵　　售成交見增、合組公司昨粵粗白等總定額爲五千五百四十一包、當售出順德廠出品五羊粗白一千二百三十包、二十一元八角、曲溪廠又二十包、二十一元六角、二號五羊綿白三十包、二十元八角、其餘四號綿白及中砂白未成交、</p>
<p>公會劃盤二四粗砂白、現貨呌二十二元、轉口六元八角、東赤白及振記大華金心籌本廠綿白、俱乏更動、惟振裕出品稍升、一號爲二十元六角、二號二十元四角、三號二十元一角、四號十九元八角、五號十九元半、號貨亦乏續開、標準五福白冰叫原價未成、其他王帽·獅球雙　玉春孔雀等建冰、叫價如前、去胃均少、</p>

<h3>旅行與電信</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>「暮春三月，江南草長，雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛。」際此天和日麗鳥語花香之時，正吾人及時行樂之日。偕二三知己，作名勝之遨遊，或參加集團，叙觀光之樂事，古人秉燭夜遊，良有以矣。</p>
<p>惟旣出外旅行，遠離家室，揖別友朋，心中不無系念。到達何地？參觀何物？不可不隨時報吿，以慰親朋。欲解决此項因難，郵遞雖便，終不若電報或長途電話之速也。</p>
<p>交通部爲便利旅客起見，曾委託中國旅行社代辦電報，凡在車站或船埠有該社之招待者，旅客卽可將擬之電報交其拍發。又鐵路車站與當地電局訂有接綫通報或通話合同者，或訂有代辦報話辦法者，旅客均可向其發報或通話。海輪或江輪裝有無綫電臺與交通部所屬之海岸電臺通報者，旅客均可於航行中拍發電報。故雖遠在天涯，决無「故園東望」之苦。</p>
<p>凡居住者欲與旅行者通信時，知其到達地點，固可對其發寄電報，不知其地點而知其路程時，亦可發寄電報。此項電報有兩種：　跟送電報，　留交電報是也。至於欲與航行中旅客通信時，探知其乘輸名稱，卽向電局接洽發寄船舶電報，或探送某輪某人電報。</p>
<p>處此交通便利之時代，旅行者能利用電信，報吿行程，居住者能利用電信，慰其寂寞，可謂識時務之士矣。</p>

<p>電報價目之高低，對於國民經濟，頗有關係。如收費過昂，爲一般民衆之經濟力量所不能負荷。不但電報業務不能普遍發展，抑且殊違國營事業便利民衆之本旨。若收費太低則電欵收入銳减，亦不足以維持電局員工薪水及電報機料等項之支出。我國現行國內電報價目，或有病其定價過昂者，然事實上較之昔年採用隔省遞加制或本省隔省制，確已低廉不少。（按隔省遞加時之報價每字最高爲四角，本省隔省制時之隔省報費爲每字一角六分或一角四分均較現行報價爲昂。）且現今華文明語電報之收報人住址稱謂在十三字以內者，祇按三字計費，密語在十四字以內者，祗按四字計費。同時華洋文加急電均已改爲兩倍收費。較之住昔華文電報之收報人姓名住址須按字計費，及華洋文加急電均按尋常電三倍收費時，約計每電可省報費一元左右。可謂廉而又廉矣。况我國幅員廣大，自上海發往西康等邊遠省區之電，仍以每字一角計費，其距離實較自上海發至日本長崎爲遠，而上海長崎間電報，每字須收費一元四角五分。彼此相較，孰廉孰昂。</p>
<p>國內各處發往香港澳門電報，雖亦視爲國內電報，但於其傳遞過程中，須經外國電綫（包括陸綫水綫）或國際無綫電路傳遞，故均按特定價目收費。該項價目，業已詳載國內電報價目表附錄內，茲不再贅。</p>
<p>二，國際電報價目</p>
<p>凡經有綫電或無錢電傳遞之國際電報，其每字總價，係由　發報及收報國之本境費，　如經中間各國之領士，機器，或綫路傳遞者，應加中間各該國之過境費，　如經由兩個無錢電台轉遞或經水錢轉遞者，應加每一電台之轉報費或水錢轉報費等三項組合而成。又國際電報每字價目，係以金法郞計算，故我國所印國際電報價目表內之國幣報價數目，係由金法郞按照匯兌率折合國幣而成，因此金法郞匯兌率之漲落，對於我國國際電報價目亦有連帶關係也。（外匯穩定後，此層尙可不生問題）。交通部電政司爲求適合事實起見，對於國際電報價目經過相當時期後，卽須重行修訂，俾所訂國際電報價目之國幣數目，可與金法郞報價數目相等，與對方結算報費時，不至因金法郞匯兌率之漲落，而有所損益。又國際電報價目之訂定及變更，均須由發報及收報兩方面互相商得同意後，方可實行。任何一國對於國際電報價目不能任意訂定或變更。最近上海市商會等團體向交通部請求减低中美間電報價目，交部未允所請，上述原因，卽其一也。</p>
<h3>避免損壞海底電綫方法（續）</h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>（C）凡船隻不可駛近，又不可將捕魚器具放下於距離電錢浮桶一海哩四分之一以內，此項浮桶常有＂Jelegreph＂。（卽電報）之標識，並有旗懸於其上。</p>
<p>（D）凡漁船應將拖網網口及奧多（Otter）戶板保守安全，勿使尖端或凸出物碰撞或損壊電錢，至於使用奧多戶板，應於下開各條，特別注意：</p>
<p>（甲）奧多戶板裏面，鐵拴之頭，均須圓滑。（乙）螺旋釘只可釘在戶板之外面，切勿使之凸出，設有凸出尖角之處；卽應挫去。</p>
<p>（丙）戶板之底不應統塊平直，只宜向前端曲進。</p>
<p>（丁）戶板底之靴金均須光滑，至靴金（非指釘亦非指鉸結）所擊之鐵拴，應有錐圓形之頭，</p>
<p>（戊）靴金應擊於前板前端之邊上，並須緊置於該邊鐵拴之上面，勿令伸出。</p>
<p>（己）應用三角式圓鐵棍兩副，置於戶板裏面，藉以縛住網繩，切勿代以鐵鏈。</p>
<p>（庚）欲將奧多戶板或拖網頭繫縛網繩及漁網之時，務請特別注意。須對絞鏈接筍兩邊之鐵完全直向戶板或漁網繫縛之。</p>

<h3>華文私務電報收報人住址名稱計費補充辦法之解釋</h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>最近交通部通令規定之由收報人轉交某人之華文私務電報收報人住址名稱計費補充辦法，曾經在本刋登載。茲因外界對於該項補充辦法尙有疑點，特再由電政司通函各電報局解釋並舉例說明如下：</p>
<p>代替收報人姓名住址之電報掛號字或第一收報人住址名稱外另有收報人名及住址者，例如：</p>
<p>（I）6855南京轉中山北路（708）號張其年（二）漢口漢景街（16）號王鴻鈞轉洞庭街五號趙彭年</p>
<p>上項舉例之發報人，旣已知第二收報人之詳細住址，當可逕電第二收報人，事實上無須再寄由第一收報人轉交也。倘發報人因特殊情形而必欲將該電發寄第一收報人轉交，自願照上項舉例格式書寫者，所有自「轉」字以下各字，均應列入電文內按字計費，以示限制。</p>
<p>某處某人並轉某人之電報，例如「靑島廣西路十號金仲華並轉鄒伯平」。，其發報人之用意，當係請第一收報人閱電後並轉知第二收報人者，與分送電報之性質相似，故宜改爲「分送」電報拍發。如發報人因未知第二收報人住址，不能作爲「分送」電報發寄者，所有自「並」字起以下各字自應一併列入電文內按字計費。</p>
<p>除上述舉例外，其外使用「轉」字或雖不用「轉」字而實含有轉交之意義者，所有其餘收報人名，均可一併刋人收報人住址內例如：</p>
<p>（1）5877＝張經理＝</p>
<p>（2）上海日報公會轉各報館＝　（3）烟台北大街恒昌號轉各號＝　（4）長沙湘春街（117）號葉志澄請轉（或話轉，電轉，郵轉，留轉）王國秀＝　（5）北平王府井大街（561）號沈雄時轉金達卿轉石開文＝　（6）0022北平＝轉王維誠李子文張漢生＝</p>
<p>所有上述各例內之第二收報人名及第三收報人名之前，旣未列有住址，「轉」字之上加註之請，話，電，郵，留等字，僅係一種轉交方法，並無取巧之處，故該項電報仍可經由第一收報人收轉。其第二收報人名及第三收報人名連同「轉」字或「請轉」「話轉」「電轉」「郵轉」「留轉」等字，均得一併列入一收報人住址名稱內照章計費。</p>
<p>遇有兩個或數個人名連接書寫，其意義可因讀法之不同而發生變動者，例如：</p>
<p>（1）6892沙市陸伯明已到申勿念朱，（2）九江大華飯店朱茂如李介蔭乘江華來潯陸，（3）巴縣陝西街（53）號方子仁郭雲峯病故盼運回欽。</p>
<p>上述三例內之第二人名，雖可列入收報人住址名稱內計算字數，但該項電報如僅係發致第一收報人者，則第　例應書爲「6007天津＝陸伯明已到申勿念朱」，第二例應書爲「九江大華飯店朱茂如＝李介蔭乘汪華來潯陸」第三例應書爲「巴縣陝西街（53）號方子仁＝郭雲峯病故盼速回欽。」倘發報人因可利用前項計費補充辦法之規定，而將第二人名列入收報人住址名稱之內，以圖節省報費，例如　「6007天津陸伯明＝已到申勿念朱」，　「九江大華飯店朱茂如李介蔭乘江華來潯陸」，　巴縣陝西街（53）號方子仁郭雲峯病故盼速回欽」，則以上三電之電文意義，均將因書寫格式之不同，而發生變化。在收報入方面收到該項電報後，亦必發生疑慮，故發報人萬不可貪小失大，務於交發電報時，向電局人員聲明，該電實係發致某人或某某二人者，或將該電之電文與收報人姓名住址分開兩行書寫，俾電局人員可將電文與收報人住址名稱用雙劃記號隔開，以免電報到達收報人時，不至誤會電文意義，此應發報人切實注意也。</p>

<h3>「生殖腺」之重要</h3>
<p>— 任國祥</p>
<p>人身腺器密佈。其最重要者爲「生殖腺」。</p>
<p>「生殖腺」不惟直接有關子嗣。且腦力之健全。精血之營養。肌肉之發育。神經之繁榮。與夫抵抗力之消長。康健之保持。靑春之回復。咸受「生殖腺」之支配。</p>
<p>「生殖腺」衰頽。或生殖腺內分泌缺乏。則衰弱各症蜂起。失去發育。早呈衰衰老。</p>
<p>例如今春有患者鮑鴻儀君。來訴有體顫肢冷。盜汗心悸等症。余察得其病根在生殖腺之萎頹。以致神經陷於極度衰弱所致。卽對症發藥。囑向正威藥房指購生殖腺製劑「生殖素」服之。連服數盒。神經立轉繁榮。所患若失。重獲壯健發育云。</p>
<h3>遺精根治法</h3>
<p>— 王士英</p>
<p>本症多由手淫過度而起。亦有因身體虧弱而起者。患者生殖腺頽廢。輸精管鬆弛。略一威戟。郎自遺洩。雖有有夢無夢之異。其病理實同。</p>
<p>本症多伴訴有失眠健忘。面黃肌瘦等症。槪由精元頻耗所致。治法當兼固精補精。標本兼施。庶得根治。</p>
<p>前月有靑年遺精者周振雄來診。經余囑向五洲藥房購服名藥「希米脫氏固精片」固其精關。治其遺精。並服「生殖素」補其精髓。治其虧損。連服五盒。所患霍然盡除。重獲發育。回復從來未有之壯健云。</p>
<h3>胃痛戒烟一例</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符</p>
<p>胃病不一。其最通常者。如胃痙攣。胃潰瘍。胃擴脹。胃炎。胃酸。胃番。胃呆。胃弱。甚者現有痛感。</p>
<p>胃病胃痛。用藥如不兼顧。則無從根治。往往纏綿多年。形成痼疾。</p>
<p>例如去秋有朱筱君來診。因所患胃病胃痛。無法根治。吸烟取緩。以致中毒成癮。因政府禁令森嚴。迭戒均以痛患陣作。半途廢止。余知非先治其胃症。難期戒烟安全。卽囑向太和藥房購服「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」根治其胃症。再用「生殖素」除共烟毒。斷其烟癮。據稱精神愉快。爲一般戒法所望塵莫及云。</p>
<h3>宮炎帶下月經不調</h3>
<p>— 賈治中</p>
<p>婦科百病。多由子宮失健而起。患者月經失調。時前時後。或多或少。共因宮炎者。則每伴有白帶腹痛等症。身虧體弱。受孕維艱。</p>
<p>去秋有梁滋葵夫人來診。訴有經閉腹痛。白帶纏綿。久婚不育。乳房萎頹等症。經余囑向新新公司購內服「女用生殖素」。外用「療帶靈」。內外兼施。期未匝月。帶凈經調。乳部重獲發育。回復新婚時代之健美。上月其至戚王小鍔女士來所談及。據云梁夫人已懐孕多月云。</p>
<h3>骨痛肢麻之原理</h3>
<p>— 喬文彬</p>
<p>凡患腎虧者。其排尿功能失去正常。每致尿酸過多。血份不潔。其尿酸形成碎玻璃屑狀之結晶。入骨則骨痛。入筋則筋痙。入肌則痠。入肢則肢麻。甚者半身不遂。全體瘓癱。狀同殘廢。</p>
<p>本症治法。以除毒解痠爲主。吾人臨診經騐。常用「强斯登氏骨疼片」。良以其配製純良。適合華人體質。克奏最美滿之特效故也。</p>
<p>最近余曾用「强斯登氏骨痛片」治愈。一遠年瘋濕骨疼患者曹聲和君。爲期僅三星期有餘云。</p>
<p>神經衰弱</p>
<p>武昌路李汝南君來函云：鄙人因先天不足·秉賦薄弱。致罹有腰疲背痛。頭暈目眩等衰弱症狀綦烈。承詹念曾醫師投用「生殖素」並施電療。爲期月許。頓復壯健云。</p>
<p>遺精得救</p>
<p>寳應杜德成君來函云：舍弟所罹遺精沉疴。服藥失效。後見貴刋載有「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」可以根治。卽依法並服。未及一月。得霍然治愈云。</p>
<p>夫婦並戒</p>
<p>本埠貝禘鏖路林君來函云：余與內子所染烟癮。迭戒痛苦。無法斷除。承介紹服「男用女用生殖素」治病强身。除毒斷癮。爲期均未逾一月云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>歌女感化院</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>天津市邇來對於繁榮市面，建樹很多。如興築馬路，開闢公園，都是顯著的政績。還有减免南市妓館捐稅，亦是振興商業的一法。迨至最近，當局又苦思深慮，設立了一所歌女感化院，希望藉當地的妓女，來挽回市面的景况。這種設施，更是別開生面，爲中外未有的新市政！</p>
<p>歌女感化院，顧名思義，無疑地要是一個感化歌女的地方，然而天津市創辦的這所歌女威化院，目的却並不在此。它是耍假這一名目，把當地的賣淫者，造成爲高等妓女，藉以繁榮市面的。入院受敎的，有南市羣英館二三等妓女，有平房子三等妓女，有紅葉村皇子地四等妓女，有三不管一帶土娼。課程分爲識字常識歌舞及算術四種，以後將加入衛生縫紉與刺繡各科。授課以三個月爲一期。畢業者給予證書，從此就可爲一有資格的妓女了。</p>
<p>妓女之有關於市面的繁榮，已爲事實所證明。各大小都市的商業，一部分都是賴妓館來維持的。故這次天津市的開設歌女感化院剛開課，就聯合大舉請願，要求市府收回成命，停止此種設施。反對的理由，是妓女入感化院受課，足以影響妓館的營業。且妓女不可具有知識，更不可與官方接近。倘使妓女學生化，又有官府作庇護，必事事與主人爲難？其實妓館主人太不明瞭當局的苦心，天津市爲了市面的繁榮，正扶助妓館營業之不暇，還會妨害它們的發展嗎？提高妓女的資格，亦就是等於提高妓館的營業。當局創立歌女感化院的目的，就在這里！</p>
<p>不過天津採用了歌女感化院的名目，來造就高等妓女，却實在太會巧立名目，淆亂聽聞。並且要繁榮市面，當局不從正當的方法設法，而竟藉花界作工具，亦是一種大錯特錯之舉。我們不但認爲滑稽，抑且覺其無聊呢！</p>
<h3>防空新利器—天綱</h3>
<p>— 陳汝惠</p>
<p>一種利器的發明；必有另一種利器可以制服：在戰爭上，攻器和守器，總是一先一後的追隨着。這個理論，我們儘可找到許多事實來作證據。</p>
<p>用防岸大砲和埋藏在水底的潛水艇，來保護被攻擊的海岸，已經打破了海軍國家在三十年前，對於軍艦戰鬥力的信任心。然而對於速度驚人，能在三因次（縱，橫！高。）中自由活動的空軍，却至今不能有效的應付。</p>
<p>我們知道高射砲隊已經電化了，命中敵機的機遇誠然增加了不少；比數；但是遇到奮勇狡猾的空軍時，還要吃一些轟炸的虧。此外如阻塞氣球，掛在空中也只能做一些「嚇人」的工作。</p>
<p>最近英國某著名發明家，正在本國政府監護下，秘密地試騐一種新式防空軍器。據說非常有效——</p>
<p>這軍器，原來就是特別的重火箭或者重砲彈。當「牠」從砲口裏射放到高空時，砲彈裏的炸藥便發生爆炸，把彈殼或箭殼炸裂，於是像焰火一樣的散開了一個鋼絲網，徐徐由空中降落。網角上附着若干個小落下傘，因此這天網必需歷數分鐘之久才可以着陸。</p>
<p>這一套「魔術」，會給敵人的空軍感受什麽一種利害呢？當天網在空中慢俊落下時，如果有一架飛機撞到了它，這飛機的推進機就會被毀，並且沒有辦法脫離天網的牽制，只能和網掙扎着一齊翻落下來。</p>
<p>這個設計，並不和高射砲一樣，只以一架飛機爲目標；而是以整隊敵機的進攻爲目標。當大隊敵機威風十足地襲來時，我們立卽在他們的航路上，散佈着許多天網，造成廣大面積的陷阱。這些飛機的速度很大，也因了慣性的關係，就容易和天網接個危險的親吻。</p>
<p>天網的開張是砲彈迅速旋轉的結果。（發生極大的離心力）除了網的本身有着這種神通外，爆炸的砲彈，也有附帶的效用，如果砲彈的一片打中了敵機，也會使牠遭到可怕的危險。</p>
<p>在這種發明上，我們又可以回憶起歐戰時（一九一八年）有一位雜誌編輯先生所建議的「旋錘彈」。這彈用二個金屬的重錘擊在一條鐵鏈的兩端，用砲彈射到空中去，使重錘在空中旋轉；以便增大天空中障碍的面積。這當然也比平常的砲彈要好些，因爲砲彈所能擊中的面積，此旋錘彈所造成的面積至少小十倍。這就是說：旋錘彈的效用，比砲彈增加了十倍。</p>
<p>不管天網與旋錘彈，如果說牠們是我們理想中的防空利器，或者想藉了這種利器，就可以避免空軍的殘殺和轟炸，那還是不敢置信的。在戰雲彌漫的動盪底現時代中，爲了求自身（民族，人類，）的幸福與平安，我們只有走上科學的大道，加緊研究和發明。科學不是戰爭的，但是戰爭是科學的。</p>
<h3>遵城雜什</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>飯館</p>
<p>從早晨十點鐘啟行，大約有三個多鐘頭，這奔馳的車子，朗聲的高呌若，開進了城門—這是省垣的重鎭呵！</p>
<p>爲了不預備多找麻煩，在進城不遠的一家客店裏歇下來。</p>
<p>行李，堆滿了客店的甬道裏，福特號的車子，開進了車行。</p>
<p>老伕頭坐了一會，携一手杖，扮了一個鬼臉，在述連地道謝聲裏，路出門限。忽然，他好像又想到什麽是的，重次的回轉來：「黃先生幾時進省呵？」老黃看了他一眼：「說不定，明天要有車就走！</p>
<p>—那末，那末……</p>
<p>—搭車，是不是？伕頭笑着，去了。</p>
<p>最發生問題的，是肚子的恐慌。早晨，爲了時問的限制，不允許有從容的時間，可是現在，在地域生疏的山城裏，到那裏去找尋飯館呢？我們這一夥走上了石子的路，心裏都急着。</p>
<p>是一個丁字街口，到處的張望一下，然而，除了流動着的人羣，除了嘈雜</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>的聽不慣的聲音外，又有什麽呢？問了問店舖的人，承他們的好意，吿訴只須拐一個灣，「世界飯店」是才開沒有多久的。立時「世界」，在想像給了我們堂皇的戚覺，在那遼闊的街頭，把每一個門面打發過去，終於，祗好說是終於，在極窄的小巷裏，坐上了飯店的雅室。</p>
<p>菜，頂好你自己不必去點，聽候堂官的報數花名，聽候他們的支配，要不然，說不定會給你失望。天，熱得有點邪氣，緊靠了不遠的大火爐，汗水不住的淌到桌頭，心頭有一塊悶，塞住了呼吸。</p>
<p>客店</p>
<p>晚上，蚊子還是照常的嗡嗡地呌，並不能爲了地士的不同肯稍許减少。</p>
<p>我們兩個人住的是東首的耳房，床，老套子沒有掉花樣，牆上貼了好看的花紋假使能數的話，臭虫的遺骸該不在少數吧！如果同宜寶旅舍相比一下，這裏，是略逐一籌的。</p>
<p>倦憊，帶着我們甜遊睡鄉，在十一點鐘的模樣。一切的留聲機樣的音波，一切的擾亂，逐漸的，由糢糊而遠了，完全的消滅下去。</p>
<p>轉一回身，外面正落着雨。瓦橡裏的雨水冲擊着地面的石階，多淸脆呵！</p>
<p>房里怪黑的，店裹的燈早滅了，天，漆一樣，什麽都被可怕的陰影統率着</p>
<p>不知怎麽一來，自己驚覺了，頭髮很濕，夾被也濕了幾塊，蓆子上，還有一灘沒有漏完的水，點上洋燭，看看老鐵，整個的身子都浸潤在水潭裏，但是，他沒有威覺，甜遊把他帶到了另外的境界。</p>
<p>不是麽？那屋頂上，從許多的小孔裏，雨水無情地刷下來。</p>
<p>我們開始動手了，把床移到不漏的地方，後來，這願望是失敗了，不大的屋子，又那裏能躱避雨的突擊？於是，把面盆盛接着，不成，這不單會阻碍了睡眠，而且，也盛接不了那麼多。讓困苦在心絃上盡力的盤旋，互相看一下，都沒有話說。</p>
<p>最後，我們把滑杆上的油布拉下來，在四個角上拴了繩子，照蛛網的辦法拉釘在房子的四周，這樣，心裏想，在帳蓋的維護下，總可以渡過了漫漠的長夜了吧？</p>
<p>雨，更大了，簡直的有些傾盆，帳蓋？失去了時效，我們蜷伏在牆的一隅，眺望着窗外的天色，有一個共同的企冀，——讓雨止着，讓晨曦的光芒刺破黑暗的世界吧！</p>

<h3>Tada Inspects Troops and Returns to Tianjin: Invites Kawabe and Others to Discuss Military Affairs; Nagai Reports on the Situation in North China; All Officers Host a Farewell Banquet for Tada; Japanese Army Ministry Announces Implementation of Increased Troop Deployment to China; Japanese Troops Landed at Qinhuangdao and Continue to Arrive in Tianjin, with a Portion Heading to Kaiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4 PM on the 15th, Tada invited Kawabe, Iida, Kawada, Nagami, Nakai, Ono, Watanabe, and others to discuss garrison defense matters. Nagai also reported on the situation in North China. At 7 PM, all officers of the garrison headquarters held a farewell banquet for Tada at the Haiguang Temple Barracks, welcoming Kawabe, Iida, and others to their new posts. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After inspecting troops in Yu, Qin, Tang, and Chang, Tada arrived in Tanggu at noon on the 15th. He gave instructions to the garrison troops and returned to Tianjin at 2 PM, accompanied by his two adjutants, Otake and Jimbo. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Brigade Commander Kawabe is scheduled to go to Beiping at noon on the 16th, accompanied by Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Watanabe Sadao, Senior Adjutant Major Onoguchi Tomo, and seven staff members, to establish the brigade headquarters. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) As part of the rotation and strengthening of Japanese troops in North China, 400 more soldiers are expected to arrive after midnight on the 15th. They will be transported in two trains on the Beining Railway from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin. At 12 AM on the 14th, the first train carrying 350 infantry, artillery, and cavalry soldiers, along with six artillery pieces, passed through Tianjin, with 100 soldiers disembarking. The rest continued to Fengtai. At 0:45 AM on the 15th, the second train arrived, carrying a total of 150 cavalry, infantry, and artillery soldiers and 80 horses. They disembarked in Tianjin and proceeded to the Haiguang Temple Barracks. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the reinforcement of Japanese troops in North China, in addition to the Beining Railway line, 1,700 soldiers will be stationed at the Juzi New Barracks in eastern Tianjin. 1,300 will be stationed at the Japanese Concession, Haiguang Temple, Xilai Hotel, Huazhong Inn, and Gongli Hospital. 2,000 will be stationed in Ping, Fengtai, and Tongxian. The troops arriving after June 5th will be mostly scattered along the Pingjin and Jinpu lines. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The first batch of over 800 newly added Japanese troops in North China arrived in Tianjin last night, with most entering the Haiguang Temple Barracks. The remaining 150 arrived in Beiping this morning and entered the Japanese Barracks. Imai stated that the Japanese garrison in Tianjin is taking advantage of this rotation opportunity to increase its troop strength. A portion has already arrived, and the rest will continue to arrive, to be stationed in various locations along the Pingjin and Beining Railway lines. The reason for the troop increase is that the number of Japanese residents along the Beining Railway line has increased compared to before, so the troop strength is slightly increased to ensure the safety of the residents. This is based on the Boxer Protocol and does not infringe upon Chinese sovereignty, nor does it harm the vested interests of other countries in North China. As for the number of people added, it cannot be announced at this time. The rumors of the 3rd and 5th Divisions are not true. The term of the garrison has not yet been determined. Brigade Commander Kawabe arrived in Tianjin yesterday and is scheduled to come to Beiping tomorrow afternoon. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yesterday, Japanese troops landed at Qinhuangdao from four transport ships. This morning, 1,700 of them arrived here by train, including a battery of artillery from the 5th Division. These new troops will be stationed in the Japanese Concession. Another batch is expected to arrive after midnight. It is reported that the total number of reinforcements is 7,600, with 500 of them going to Beiping. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The first batch of 150 of the new Japanese garrison troops for Beiping arrived today. More are expected to arrive tomorrow. According to reliable sources, a detachment of the new garrison will be stationed in Tongzhou, where the "East Hebei Autonomous Government" is located. Major General Kawabe is scheduled to come to Beiping tomorrow to assume the position of commander of the Japanese garrison in Beiping. New barracks are currently being rushed to completion within the Japanese Legation compound to house the increased guard force. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Here, the Japanese increase in troops stationed in North China is seen as another step by Japan to take active action in East Asia. Although the Japanese side claims that this move does not harm Chinese sovereignty, nor does it harm the interests of other countries in North China, there is still reason to be suspicious. (15th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry announced at 11:30 AM on the 15th that it had decided to implement an increase in the number of troops stationed in China during the current rotation period. (15th Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry issued a bulletin today, announcing its decision to implement an increase in the North China garrison during this periodic rotation. It also stated that Japan is deeply concerned about the current situation in North China, allowing for it due to the harm of communist troops, the underground activities of the Communist Party, and the anti-Japanese organizations in the Pingjin area. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Exchange of Directors in Tianjin Bureaus</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 4 PM on the 15th, Liu Yushu assumed the new position of Director of the Public Works Bureau, with the former Director Sun Weidong personally handing over the duties. At 5 PM, Sun Weidong assumed the new position of Director of the Public Security Bureau. In both cases, Shi Jisen, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, represented Xiao Zhenying in the inventory and delivered an address. Since the two directors were exchanging positions, in addition to the Secretary-General, the Chief of the First Section, the Accountant, and the General Affairs Officer also exchanged positions. There were no other personnel changes. The appointments of the Directors of the Health and Finance Bureaus have not yet been announced, and there is no date set for their assumption of office. Shi Jisen stated that the Municipal Government has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of the reorganization of the Haihe Engineering Bureau, and has also submitted a report to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, hoping that diplomatic efforts will be made. The Corps Diplomatique also knows that it is in the wrong but is still unwilling to accept our suggestion. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Weidong stated that the city area has expanded, and the police force is insufficient, so it will be expanded. The public security of Tianjin is related to many parties, and stabilizing the people's hearts is the first priority. First, harmony should be established with the foreign powers to eliminate territorial boundaries to facilitate municipal defense. With the bandits fleeing from Jin territory, the public security of Tianjin is no longer as tense as before. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Interferes with Customs Anti-Smuggling Efforts: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Another Strong Protest; Demands Suppression of Illegal Activities by Japanese and Korean People; Minister of Finance Kong Telegrahs Provinces and Cities to Request Assistance in Anti-Smuggling Efforts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Japanese side condoning Japanese and Korean people's smuggling in Hebei and interfering with Chinese customs personnel's anti-smuggling efforts, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to the Japanese Embassy in China, but no satisfactory reply was received. Recently, smuggling has become increasingly rampant, greatly affecting the country's financial, economic, and commercial situation. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has again lodged a strong protest with the Japanese government, demanding that it stop interfering with customs anti-smuggling efforts and suppress illegal activities by Japanese and Korean people. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) For the anti-smuggling issues, Minister of Finance Kong telegraphed various provincial and municipal governments on the 15th, stating, "Customs revenue is vital to the nation. However, recently, smuggling has been rampant everywhere, and smuggled goods are flooding the market, resulting in a sharp decline in tax revenue and huge losses. Even legitimate Chinese and foreign businesses are suffering losses. Although the customs authorities have tried every means to prevent and suppress smuggling, the coastline is vast, and there are many ports, making it very easy to carry out smuggling. The long arm cannot reach everywhere. It has been noted that administrative organs in various provinces and cities have previously received an order from the Executive Yuan to assist in anti-smuggling efforts. Now that the smuggling situation has become increasingly serious, a special telegram is sent to request that you instruct your subordinate organs to cooperate wholeheartedly in the investigation and suppression of smuggling. You should also inform merchants and the public that if they discover smuggled goods, they should report them to the customs authorities or local military police for investigation and suppression. After the smuggled goods are seized, the customs authorities will deal with them strictly and provide generous rewards in accordance with the regulations to encourage reporting. At this time of national crisis, we must share the same fate and sincerely assist each other in overcoming difficulties. We eagerly await your assistance in this matter." (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has approved the anti-smuggling measures for North China, and the Ministry of Finance, upon receiving notification, ordered the customs authorities to follow them on the 15th. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Zhongfu stated that a method has been agreed upon with the Japanese side regarding the suppression of Japanese and Korean vagrants. The Japanese side has agreed to gradually implement it within one month. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Xichao went to Beiping on the evening of the 15th to seek protection and investigate the smuggling and consolidated tax situation. Xiao has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions regarding the anti-smuggling law in North China. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Returned to Beiping from Tianjin Yesterday: Diplomatic Matters Still Being Negotiated in Tianjin; Matsumuro Goes to Changchun to See Ueda</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Zhang Zizhong and others, returned to Beiping by special train at 2:30 PM on the 15th. Xiao Zhenying, Liu Jialuan, and other important figures went to the station to see them off. Diplomatic matters are still being negotiated in Tianjin. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan returned to Beiping this afternoon and stated that he had a throat ailment, so he stayed in Tianjin for treatment for more than a month, causing much speculation outside. He is not yet cured. He met with Nagami in Tianjin, which was only a private social event. When he met with Matsumuro, Matsumuro expressed his willingness to take responsibility for negotiating a solution to the Hebei-Chahar issue. He met with Tada once and exchanged views on Sino-Japanese relations, but these were not formal negotiations. The Japanese side has indicated that the East Hebei puppet organization can be expected to be abolished, and the solution is only a matter of time. Before Doihara returned home, he promised to completely resolve the East Hebei issue within two months. However, because the key to the solution is the overall relationship between the two governments, it cannot be completely achieved at the local level. The Hebei-Chahar issue can be expected to continue to be negotiated after the new commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, Tashiro, takes office. The fundamental solution to the smuggling problem in North China should be sought by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. The losses from smuggling in North China in April reached 1.9 million. Smuggling is not limited to North China; it is also happening in various parts of South China. If the authorities can prevent it before it happens, this phenomenon will not occur. Hebei-Chahar is still actively working on anti-communism. He has always opposed the Communist Party. After his affairs in Beiping are settled, he will go to various counties to inspect. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan stated that he had not heard anything about the rumors that the Japanese side was increasing troops and would set up outposts along the Kaiping-Pukou, Ping-Sui, and Ping-Han lines, and would also establish outposts in southern Hebei. Regarding the rumors in Inner Mongolia, he had previously received a telegram from Minister He inquiring about it and replied that Prince De would not declare independence because he had no reason to do so and his intentions were definitely not problematic. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told Chinese journalists here today that there is no possibility of a fundamental solution to the smuggling problem except for the following three items: 1. The Chinese and Japanese governments should negotiate a compromise solution. 2. The Chinese government should reduce tariffs. 3. A unified customs administration should be established in Tianjin. Song mentioned the increase in Japanese garrison troops in North China, saying that according to the Boxer Protocol, Japan's garrison was limited to 800 men, but the agreement established by He Yingqin and Umezu last summer had changed the number of Japanese garrison troops. The current increase in Japanese troops is only the result of the above-mentioned agreement. Song also spoke about the East Hebei Autonomous Government, saying that Tada and Matsumuro both favored abolishing the East Hebei Autonomous Council, but the Kwantung Army opposed the move. When asked about the Sino-Japanese anti-communist agreement, Song refused to answer. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Matsumuro left for Changchun on the Ping-Shen through train at midnight on the 14th to exchange views with Ueda on the East Hebei issue. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin's Remains to be Temporarily Placed at Huanghuagang; Liu Luyin and Others Arrive in Hong Kong En Route to Guangdong; The Central Government Dispatches Sun Ke and Others to Guangdong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It has been decided to temporarily place Hu's coffin in a pavilion built at Huanghuagang, pending the arrival of a ship sent by the Central Government to transport it to Beijing. The Central Government's funeral officials are expected to arrive in Guangdong on the 20th, and Hu's coffin is scheduled to be transported to Beijing on June 1st. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Liu Luyin, Li Xiaosheng, Chen Qun, He Shizhen, Tang Haian, and Feng Rui arrived in Hong Kong this morning on the President Jefferson. Liu, Li, Chen, and He took the Guangzhou-Kowloon train this afternoon to Guangdong to pay their respects to Hu. Tang and Feng took the evening boat to Guangdong. In addition to meeting with the Guangdong authorities, Tang will also meet with Huang Xuchu to discuss the Guangxi's adoption of the yuan system. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the death of Chairman Hu, the German Embassy sent personnel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express condolences. The Brazilian Minister to China, Laigue, also sent a telegram of condolence from Beiping yesterday, which reads, "To His Excellency Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing, please accept my sincere condolences on the passing of Mr. Hu Hanmin." (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for its opinion on Mr. Hu's funeral arrangements and state funeral. A reply telegram has been received, which reads, "President Sun Ke of the Legislative Yuan, your telegram of the 13th has been received. The Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee have requested the Central Government to approve a state funeral for Mr. Hu. The dates for the public memorial service are currently set for May 25, 26, and 27 at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou. We have replied specifically. [Signed] Xiao Focheng, Zou Lu, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Lin Yun." (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government has appointed Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, Li Wenfan, and Fu Bingchang as four commissioners to Guangdong to assist with Chairman Hu's funeral. Sun, Li, and Fu will take the night train to Shanghai on the 15th to wait for a boat south. After arriving in Shanghai, they will meet with Wang Chonghui for discussions. Ye will stay in Nanjing for a few days before going to Shanghai to join them on their trip south. Sun and the others are expected to be away for two weeks and will return to Nanjing at the end of the month. The Legislative Yuan will suspend its regular sessions during Sun and Ye's absence and will resume on June 5th. Many people in Nanjing are requesting leave in their personal capacity to go south to attend the funeral. The Central Government has largely completed the planning for Mr. Hu's memorial and funeral matters, and it will be submitted to a temporary standing committee meeting for a decision. The temporary standing committee meeting will be held around the 18th, and Ye Chucang has also instructed the secretariat to draft the eulogy and other ceremonial documents as soon as possible so that they can be submitted to the standing committee for approval and taken to Guangdong for use. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong was extremely saddened to learn of Chairman Hu's passing. He recently told reporters that the death of Chairman Hu is a loss of a leader for the party and the nation, and a loss of a mentor for him personally. He has not met Chairman Hu for several years since returning from his European tour two years ago, but they have exchanged letters and telegrams from time to time. In the past two weeks, Chairman Hu had sent him his photograph and invited him to travel south, but he was unable to accept the invitation due to his busy schedule. He regrets this very much. His grief was evident in his words, which shows his deep personal feelings. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee will hold a temporary standing committee meeting to decide on a state funeral for Chairman Hu. Sun Ke, Ye Chucang, Li Wenfan, and Fu Bingchang were ordered to go south to Guangdong immediately to pay their respects. Sun consulted with Chairman Lin at 9:00 AM on the 15th and took the night train to Shanghai with Li Wenfan and Fu Bingchang. Ye Chucang must wait until after the temporary standing committee meeting before going to Shanghai, so he will be delayed for a day or two. After Sun and the others meet with Wang Chonghui in Shanghai, Wang may also accompany them to Guangdong. They are scheduled to depart on a ship on the 19th and return to Nanjing before June 5th. The Legislative Yuan's general assembly will not be held during the absence of the President and Vice-President, unless necessary. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Standing Committee of the Funeral Committee for Chairman Hu held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th, attended by Liu Jiwen, Hu Yisheng, and five others, chaired by Zou Lu. The following resolutions were passed: 1. Fly the flag at half-mast in front of the Memorial Hall until the coffin is moved. 2. Collect Mr. Hu's calligraphy, writings, notes, and anecdotes.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Discusses Current Financial and Monetary Issues: Sino-American Talks on Currency Do Not Involve an Agreement; Effective Measures to Stop Smuggling Will Soon Be Implemented</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi met with Central News Agency reporters at the Ministry at noon on the 15th and made the following remarks on various important current financial and monetary issues. Kong first stated that the Sino-American talks on currency have not yet reached the signing stage. The meeting between Chen Guangfu and the American Secretary of the Treasury was only an exchange of views and did not involve any agreement. The results of future discussions between the two sides will be announced later. Rumors that China has borrowed 25 million US dollars from the US government are untrue. Next, regarding the real estate mortgage loan bank, Kong stated that it is roughly in sight, and it is only waiting for the Legislative Yuan to pass and promulgate the laws related to real estate mortgages (i.e., the Compulsory Execution Law) so that people can obtain prompt legal judgments for real estate litigation. Then the real estate mortgage loan bank can be formally established. Moreover, after the establishment of the bank, it will still need to utilize foreign capital, so there must be thorough planning for real estate mortgage laws first. Finally, regarding the problem of stopping smuggling, all customs authorities have been carrying out anti-smuggling missions at all times. However, because smuggling is rampant, it is necessary to devise more effective methods to stop it. These effective methods have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will soon be implemented. If smuggling involves diplomatic aspects, it will be resolved through diplomatic means. If it involves criminal aspects, it will be severely punished by law. In addition, audit and control systems will be used to curb the rampant trend of smuggling. The national tax revenue has suffered significant losses due to the impact of smuggling. In addition to implementing the above-mentioned effective measures, it is also planned to improve the organizational structure of tax revenue agencies such as the consolidated tax and salt tax in accordance with the spirit of the revised Ministry of Finance Organization Law to make them more economically rational and seek to increase national tax revenue.

<h3>The Ideological Problems of Youth in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Since the student movement began, universities in Beiping and Tianjin have been at the forefront of the movement. This is because they are located in North China and have witnessed and experienced the situation more deeply than the youth in universities in the South. Beiping is the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement, and not only is patriotic thought very common, but also extreme ideologies are easily fostered. Today, although the student movement seems to be gradually subsiding on the surface, in fact, there have been surprising developments and changes. The reason for the decline of the movement lies in the division of factions and the passivity of the faculty, and the restrictions imposed by the authorities are also a major factor. Extreme elements are gradually focusing their attention on internal problems, the organization of political parties, and the propaganda of certain ideologies. The trend is very clear, and the motive is also very obvious. We cannot but sympathize with the generosity, courage, activeness, and hard work of the youth. We cannot but worry about the future of the national salvation movement due to the dispersal of the youth's forces and the cutting off of battle lines.</p>
<p>The ideology of the youth in Beiping and Tianjin can be divided into three factions: leftist, rightist, and liberal. Judging from the responsible figures of the Student Union and the publications of various universities, the domination of leftist forces is undoubtedly true. Rightist forces hardly exist except in one or two universities. The middle-of-the-roaders are afraid to take the lead and are afraid to take responsibility. Those who are tired of hearing about national salvation affairs are wise to protect themselves. Those who close their doors and study are pessimistic. Some are depressed due to disappointment. Others are mentally abnormal due to excessive stimulation. Among the professors, except for a few who are usually popular with the youth due to their leftist theories, most of the others are indifferent and irresponsible and are despised by the youth. There are even those who advocate "no middle-aged, only youth." At this critical moment of survival, the intellectuals are divided into left and right, old and young. Those with strong prejudices who complain about heaven and blame others, defame A and destroy B believe that only their own remedies are sufficient to save China. This phenomenon is worrying and sad.</p>
<p>The ineffectiveness of the student movement and the lack of a unified battle line are less the responsibility of the youth than of the government. The responsibility that the government should bear is even less than that of the professors. Under this kind of situation, anyone with a little humanity and a little sense of Chinese nationality will think about seeking a way out. Moreover, what the youth in Beiping and Tianjin see and hear every day is nothing but the phenomenon and news of national subjugation and racial extinction. They either do not know the government's specific policies at all or do not understand them at all. Therefore, they become suspicious of the government and feel that the current disaster is more unbearable every day. Cunning people take advantage of this sentiment and deliberately make dangerous remarks and instigate trouble. The ideology of the youth is like water flowing downhill. The overflowing enthusiasm, like the water of the Yellow River, if not properly guided, will flood and cause disaster. The education authorities only seek peace and quiet, but they do not know that temporary peace and quiet on the surface is the brewing of a more restless future.</p>
<p>However, under the current situation, it is very difficult for the government authorities to lead the youth and guide them on the right path. This kind of leadership should be in the hands of the professors. They are more rational, have more knowledge and experience. Although their sense of national crisis is not as sharp and sensitive as that of the youth, their understanding of the way out of the country and how to overcome the difficulties is at least more accurate than that of the youth. They should know that simply crying out in despair is useless in practice. Extreme thoughts and actions will weaken their own forces and cause problems that they do not want to exist. However, most of them stand by and watch, thinking that since the youth are going to extremes, the authorities only know how to suppress them, and the professors have nothing to do. They can only keep their mouths shut. This kind of attitude is very wrong. Future generations will surely point to the leading figures of the intellectual world today as sinners against the country and the nation. Can they not be exhorted?</p>

<h3>Decline of Overseas Chinese Influence in Malaya</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in the past, commerce, industry, and agriculture in Malaya were all managed by overseas Chinese. However, since the Japanese promoted their southward expansion, the status of overseas Chinese has been greatly shaken. Recently, Arabs and Malays in Malaya have gradually focused on economic endeavors. Moreover, due to restrictions from the local government's policies, the influence of overseas Chinese has plummeted. Nowadays, the development of Malay cooperative enterprises is burgeoning like bamboo shoots after rain. According to recent surveys, there are more than 280 Malay cooperative branches, with a capital of over 5 million, and the number of members has increased to over 10,000. Their efforts are still expanding. The needs of Malayans can now be self-sufficient, without relying on overseas Chinese for assistance. Therefore, the intermediary position of overseas Chinese in the economy is becoming precarious. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Ambition and Life of the New Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru; Foreign Ministry's Only China Expert Advocates Unification of Diplomacy Towards China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government decided to appoint Kawagoe Shigeru, the Consul General in Tianjin, as the ambassador to China. As a result of Prime Minister Hirota's request for Imperial approval, the appointment ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace at 11 a.m. on the 15th. The Emperor bestowed an imperial message and awarded the following official record: Kawagoe Shigeru, of the Fourth Rank and Second Order of Merit, is appointed as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Shanghai Electric Communication News) Kawagoe Shigeru, the Ambassador to China, is from Miyazaki Prefecture. In the 41st year of Meiji (1908), he graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University. The following year, he joined the Railway Agency and served as a secretary in the Railway Agency for about two years. In the first year of Taisho, he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, belonging to the so-called 20th term group of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the same term, besides the current Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Eiji Amau, and the Director of the Eurasian Bureau, Shigenori Togo, there was also Sadaji Tsubogami, the former Vice Minister of Colonial Affairs, who was also considered for the post of Ambassador to China. Kawagoe, the new ambassador, started his diplomatic career as a consular officer trainee, serving in Harbin. Later, he served as Consul in Shashi and Hankou, worked in the Bureau of Commerce of the Province, and the Asia Bureau, and was a secretary at the Swiss Legation and the German Embassy. He also served as Consul General in Jilin and Qingdao, the first Counselor of the Embassy in "Manchukuo," Consul General in Guangzhou, and Consul General in Tianjin, until now. He has lived in the diplomatic world for more than 20 years, most of which has been in China. His footprints have covered the north and south. He is the only China expert in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is taciturn and content with simplicity. He rarely uses foreign languages at any time. Some say that Kawagoe's promotion from Consul General in Tianjin to Ambassador to China was due to the recommendation of the army. This is a prejudice. Considering the term of office in the officialdom, which is the biggest factor for promotion, it can be known that Kawagoe's imperial appointment as ambassador is a natural sequence. For example, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mitsumasa, who is one term senior, is the 20th term; Gu, the Counselor of the Embassy in Manchuria, who has a high voice for Ambassador to China, is the 22nd term, one term junior; Ishii, the Consul General in Shanghai, is the 14th term. Because Kawagoe has many acquaintances in the upper and middle levels of the military, it is said that the military's intention is reflected in diplomacy, which is not true. He has a belief in Japanese diplomacy. In August of the 7th year of Showa, he served as Counselor of the Embassy in Manchuria (the Ambassador to Manchuria was the late Marshal Muto), which was already the de facto ambassador. However, he refused to resume his post after only two months in office after taking the original text of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol to Tokyo. After Foreign Minister Arita took office, he worked hard to determine the basic tone of future China policy and has largely achieved it. He recognized Kawagoe as a suitable person to carry out this policy, so he appointed him. Therefore, future diplomacy towards China must be completely unified as Foreign Minister Arita hopes. The National Government desires the unification of Japanese diplomacy towards China even more than Japan itself. Therefore, the Chinese side can have considerable expectations for the appointment of Ambassador Kawagoe. Also, Kawagoe is a diplomatic critic and is known for his literary talent in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Problem in North China; Japanese Authorities' Sophistry; Orally Refute British and American Protests; Say It Has Nothing to Do with Japanese Officials</h3>
<p>(London) According to news here, Japan's reply to the British and American protests regarding the smuggling problem in North China completely denies any connection with Japanese officials. The implication is that Japan does not want to harm China's economic position or destroy the market for foreign goods. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as usual, received news reporters every day. The reporters asked many questions about the smuggling in North China. The spokesman evaded the issue, saying that it was China's internal affair. As for the reason why smuggling has reached today's level, it is because China's tariffs are too high and Chinese customs officers lack enthusiasm. The spokesman did not want to elaborate on the details of the British and American ambassadors' questions regarding the issue and the reply of the Japanese Foreign Minister, Ariyoshi. He then asked the reporters to provide "substantial evidence" against the claim that the rise of smuggling was due to Japanese pressure on Chinese customs. He also said that he believed that the He Yingqin-Umezu Agreement did not necessarily require the Japanese army in North China to disarm Chinese customs officers and patrol boats. The steps Japan is currently taking in Tianjin are to protect the legitimate commercial interests of the Japanese, which have been greatly damaged as a result of smuggling. Next, he talked about the increase in Japanese garrison troops in North China, saying that the number of Japanese residents in the "East Hebei Autonomous Government" jurisdiction and the Beining Railway area has recently increased. The number of Japanese troops stationed in China is too small, and it is difficult to fulfill their responsibilities in case of emergency. Therefore, the Army Ministry decided to increase the number of Japanese troops in accordance with the provisions of the Boxer Protocol. The opinion of the Army Ministry authorities is that this move does not infringe on Chinese sovereignty in North China, nor does it infringe on the rights enjoyed by foreign countries in China. The Army Ministry now believes that Japan can adjust the relationship between Japan, North China, "Manchukuo," and other foreign countries. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Real Cause of Rampant Smuggling in North China; The Japanese Army Uses Smuggling to Oppress Our Country; Hoping to Achieve Their Political Goals</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said that if the North China Customs anti-smuggling authorities were not unreasonably obstructed, they could perform their duties smoothly and eliminate smuggling activities within a few weeks, or reduce them to an insignificant level, and restore their legitimate management rights over goods imported into the ports of North China. Since the customs anti-smuggling agencies have recently increased their strength and reorganized all measures to protect customs interests, the results have been excellent. Therefore, this statement is by no means empty talk. Customs anti-smuggling teams now detect smuggling of goods worth 8 million yuan every year, with customs duties of about 3 million yuan. This effect is obviously not something that can be achieved with ineffective work. According to recent official reports, before the end of May 1933 (the translator believes that it should be 1935 based on the following), smuggling in North China could not do whatever it wanted. At that time, there was only small-scale smuggling, which was easily suppressed. There was illegal export of silver by the Beining Railway in the Shanhaiguan area, but the number gradually increased after April of that year. Korean and Japanese smugglers, regardless of the interference of customs officers, redoubled their efforts. In May 1935, the Japanese military authorities forced the customs patrol team to withdraw from Shanhaiguan and implemented the disarmament of anti-smuggling personnel, so the situation naturally changed greatly. The customs anti-smuggling team lost its position. It is no surprise that anti-smuggling personnel with bare hands must deal with smugglers carrying weapons, which is like throwing an egg against a stone, and they have no power to speak of.</p>
<p>In September of that year, the Japanese authorities issued another order stating that according to the terms of the Tanggu Agreement, which have not yet been announced, customs anti-smuggling ships should retreat to the unarmed area three miles outside the boundary. Anti-smuggling ships shall not engage in anti-smuggling within the three-mile boundary. The Japanese authorities then intensified their efforts and announced that if Japanese ships were interfered with outside the three-mile boundary, it would be regarded as piracy and dealt with by means of suppressing pirates. Therefore, smugglers became more unscrupulous. In other words, anti-smuggling work outside the two-mile coastline between Lutai and Shanhaiguan can only be applied to Chinese ships. Therefore, all smuggling ships fly the Japanese flag. Smugglers can pass unhindered from Dalian to the Chinese coast. Smuggled goods are unloaded at designated locations on the coast, and no one dares to stop them. After unloading, they are transported to Tianjin by rail and it is not difficult to transport them to other ports in China. The railway authorities have not been able to cooperate with the customs, so there is currently no way to stop the transportation and sale of smuggled goods from North China to various places. According to the report, the customs anti-smuggling team is now doing its duty, but it has not received the assistance of its own government, which is especially unfortunate. Smuggling in South China has been greatly reduced recently due to the strict enforcement of the customs authorities, which can be seen from the increased number of declared goods imported into that part of China. The serious service of the anti-smuggling team has reduced the number of goods smuggled into Guangzhou by civilian ships to a minimum. The customs anti-smuggling fleet has a total of 25 large ships and another 40 small ships built since 1929 for local work. The team was established not long ago, and its achievements are remarkable and admirable. Customs officials along the customs posts and border areas at land ports are also seriously cooperating to prevent smuggling. Recently, customs defense teams have been organized in various places to increase the general anti-smuggling work.</p>
<p>Local officials often do not help the anti-smuggling team and sometimes even obstruct it. In fact, they do not encourage smuggling. However, customs policy has always been based on accommodation in order to eliminate dissent and ultimately obtain cooperation. This policy has been effective, but it is difficult to be effective in today's situation in North China. The smuggling dispute there is no longer a financial matter, but has obviously become a major issue of international politics. These commentators have now acknowledged this point and frankly stated their opinion that the Japanese military authorities are using this smuggling campaign to force the Chinese government to recognize unspecified conditions in order to consolidate the relationship between China and Japan, which is justified. Therefore, the customs anti-smuggling team is doing its duty to the best of its ability despite the restrictions imposed by foreign parties, and it is not responsible for the current situation. Without the protection of its own government, the anti-smuggling team is naturally unable to resist the force displayed by foreign aggressors. If this dispute continues, the integrity of the customs will be in danger, foreign debts will be precarious, and foreign trade seems to be disrupted to an unbearable extent.</p>
<h3>Close Contact Between Britain and Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters learned today that German bankers, in view of the rampant smuggling in North China, which endangers Chinese customs duties, are currently in close contact with the London Committee. The London Committee was established not long ago, and its purpose is to protect the interests of British holders of Chinese bonds. Every day, the Daily Telegraph carries a prominent message stating that China will request a temporary suspension of the principal and interest of bonds secured by customs duties.

<h3>Japanese Budget Subcommittee Discusses South Seas Issues: Colonial Minister Says Utilize Various Islands for Espionage Development</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The House of Representatives Budget First Subcommittee on the 14th, when examining matters under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Ministry, Sato Yakunosuke asked whether the government had any intention of abolishing the South Seas Agency and having the Governor-General of Taiwan administer the South Seas, and what about the idea of a civilian system for the Governor-General of Taiwan. Colonial Minister Nagata replied that the issue of abolishing the South Seas Agency had not been considered, and that the Governor-General of Taiwan should be selected from both civilian and military personnel. Sato asked what the Colonial Minister's views were on southern policy. Colonial Minister Nagata replied that he intended to use the islands north of the South Seas as a base for further external development. Sato asked what about abolishing the name "Mandated Territories." Nagata replied that to avoid international disputes, the name should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Next, Asada Ryousitsu took the floor and spoke in detail about the impoverished state of farming villages in various northeastern prefectures, and then questioned the government's rescue measures.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Baba replied that relief measures would be established after the twelfth year. Then, Mizuno Jinzaburo questioned the unified aviation issue. Navy Minister Nagano replied that the government was currently studying the issue of establishing an aviation ministry and intended to fully develop the aviation industry as much as possible. Army Minister Terauchi replied that the army intended to make every effort to assist the civil aviation industry. Finally, Communications Minister Raimu reported on the plan to open civil air routes between Taipei and Fukuoka and to prepare for a new air route from Taipei to Bangkok. The meeting adjourned at noon. (15th Allied Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Minister's Remarks: The Soviet Union Absolutely Does Not Care, Confident in Military Superiority over Japan</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian government seems to be completely unconcerned by the remarks made by Japanese Army Minister Terauchi in the Diet, criticizing Russia's military preparations in eastern Siberia as a threat to Japan. The Russian army newspaper agreed with an editorial in the London Times, believing that if Japan started a military arms race with Russia, its advantage would entirely lie with Russia. The newspaper ridiculed Terauchi's statement that the Russian Air Force in Siberia would attack Japanese cities, saying that the only response the Soviet Union could give to this statement was to further submit a public Russo-Japanese non-aggression pact to Japan.

<h3>Sino-U.S. Agreement on Silver Purchase Concluded: 50 Million Ounces Priced at 50 Cents per Ounce; Rumor of a $25 Million Loan Unfounded</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Economic and Financial News Agency recently reported that a group of Chinese bankers, including Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the China Bank and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, had reached an agreement with U.S. Treasury officials stipulating that the U.S. Treasury should purchase 50 million ounces of silver from China, priced at 50 cents per ounce, so that the proceeds from the sale could be used to maintain the current price of Chinese currency in the exchange market. (14th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was learned today from reliable sources that the talks between Finance Minister H. H. Kung and Chen Guangfu of the Chinese banking group have already agreed on a method for the United States to purchase Chinese silver again. However, a silver purchase agreement has not yet been concluded. Informed sources here claim that Chen Guangfu does not have full authority to sell silver, and this matter should be negotiated in the future by banks and diplomatic representatives. However, the exchange of views has created a new situation that facilitates China's sale of silver. As for the rumors circulating in Shanghai that China has agreed to sell 25 million yuan of silver to the United States, informed sources here believe this is inaccurate. The rumors of U.S. loans to China have also been denied here, as the United States cannot sell this international loan. (14th National News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) There has recently been a rumor that China and the United States have concluded a monetary agreement, with the United States lending a large amount of debt to China, and stipulating that the U.S. Treasury Department will purchase Chinese silver at a fixed price in the future. Responsible parties here today have denied this rumor, as the U.S. Treasury Department has no authority to initiate debt loans to China. Although this agreement could allow the United States to continue purchasing Chinese silver when China needs gold to stabilize its exchange rates, there may not be a provision for the U.S. Treasury Department to immediately purchase and set a future silver purchase price other than the market price. (14th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) News from Shanghai states that a group of Chinese bankers, including Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the China Bank and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, arrived in the United States in early April to discuss a $25 million loan with the U.S. Treasury Department. Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, recently issued a statement to our agency, formally denying this rumor and reiterating that Chen's main task on this trip was to open a branch of the China Bank in New York, which will soon be registered in accordance with New York State law. He also said that Chen's talks with U.S. Treasury officials were very smooth and would be successful soon. However, Shi did not specify the issues discussed. (14th Havas Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Naval Negotiations to Begin Immediately: Russia Proposes to Britain: Expansion of Naval Freedom Demanded in the Far East; Qualitative Restrictions in Europe Depend on Germany</h3>
<p>(London) According to the note submitted by the Soviet Union to the British Foreign Office today, Soviet naval policy has two main points: 1. The Soviet Union has the freedom to expand its navy in the Far East; 2. The qualitative restrictions in Europe must depend on Germany. (15th National News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) After Britain signed naval treaties with France and the United States, it immediately requested the Soviet Union to sign the same agreement, which has been accepted by the Soviet government. Colonel Chekinsky, the naval attache of the Soviet Embassy, has returned to his post from Moscow with government instructions and will soon begin negotiations with the British Admiralty. The current negotiations between Britain and Germany on naval issues will be temporarily suspended during the Anglo-Russian negotiations, as Germany wants to wait until the Anglo-Russian naval issue is resolved before signing an agreement with Britain.

<h3>Limited Effectiveness of the Three-Nation Naval Treaty: Britain Decides to Add Light Cruisers</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the naval authorities are currently planning to expand the number of leadership ships in the existing small fleet (currently classified as light cruisers), and have begun negotiations with the Foreign Office and France and the United States. Naval sources claim that Japan has stated that it is unwilling to participate in the qualitative restriction measures stipulated in the Anglo-French-American naval treaty, and the negotiations between the countries on the issue of banning submarine warfare are also quite difficult. Therefore, the effectiveness of the Three-Nation Naval Treaty is very limited. (14th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin stated today that negotiations are currently underway with the United States, Japan, France, and Italy to avoid unrestricted naval construction competition after the London Treaty expires at the end of this year. Baldwin made this statement in response to a question in the House of Commons, and said that there is no doubt that Britain must increase its destroyer tonnage.

<h3>French Communist Party Declines to Join the Cabinet, Explaining Reasons</h3>
<p>(Paris) The orthodox Socialist Party previously invited the Communist Party to join the future cabinet. The Communist Party has now decided to decline, and Party Secretary-General and Member of Parliament Dolares sent a letter to the Socialist Party explaining the reasons for the refusal, saying, "The French people have high expectations for both reforming the socio-economic system and guaranteeing freedom and pacifism. This is the task of the future cabinet, and our party urgently wants to find ways to help it succeed. However, we firmly believe that if our party supports the future cabinet with a faithful, unreserved, and consistent spirit, it will be more beneficial to the interests of the people. On the contrary, if our party joins the cabinet, it will give the enemies of the people an excuse to attack, causing panic and making it impossible to realize the above-mentioned task. After careful consideration, we have to decline the invitation to join the cabinet. We hope that you will understand our difficulties." (14th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>London-Cape Town Flight: Mrs. Mollison Breaks Record: Only Takes 4 Days and 16 Hours: Minor Stoppage Due to Bad Weather En Route</h3>
<p>(London) Mrs. Mollison safely landed at Croydon Airport at 1:36 PM today, setting a new aviation record of 4 days, 16 hours, and 17 minutes from Cape Town to London, shortening the record currently held by Lieutenant Ross by one day, thirteen hours, and forty-eight minutes. Thus, Mrs. Mollison now holds both the inbound and outbound flight records between London and Cape Town. Her current flight from London to Cape Town took 3 days, 6 hours, and 27 minutes, shortening the record held by Ross by eleven hours and nine minutes. (15th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) When Mrs. Mollison flew out of Athens at 11:32 AM yesterday, she originally intended to fly directly to London. Therefore, tens of thousands of people gathered at Croydon Airport last night to await her arrival, hoping to give her a warm welcome, but they were all disappointed, as Mrs. Mollison was forced to land at 7:02 PM last night in Graz, Austria, 800 miles from both Athens and London, due to bad weather, and planned to continue her flight this morning. Even with this stop, she still had more than two days to break the record of six days, six hours, and thirty-seven minutes held by Lieutenant Ross from Cape Town to London. Last night, people in London predicted that Mrs. Mollison would arrive at Croydon Airport around 10:00 PM, and they flocked to the airport one after another, looking forward to her arrival, with tens of thousands of people filling the entire field and making it lively. The authorities specially dispatched police to the scene to maintain order. When they received the news of Mrs. Mollison's landing in Graz, they reluctantly dispersed and returned home.

<h3>Italian Chamber of Deputies Excitedly Approves Annexation of Abyssinia: Monument Commemorating Creation of New Empire; Blind Deputy Extols Peace and Truth</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Chamber of Deputies today, in great excitement, passed the order to annex Abyssinia. A total of 308 deputies attended, all of whom voted in favor, with not a single dissenting vote. Mussolini did not make any remarks as expected by most people when he introduced the order. The order declared that Italy had complete sovereignty over Abyssinia, and that the King of Italy was the Emperor of Abyssinia, appointing General Badoglio as Governor-General of Abyssinia. After the Chamber of Deputies passed the order, it resolved to build a bronze monument in the Chamber, inscribed with the words "Mussolini founded the Empire on May 9th of the fourteenth year of the Fascist era." Before adjourning, the rapporteur Carlo gave a short speech, saying that General Badoglio would now be given full power to govern Abyssinia, pending the formulation of regulations to change the region into a new autonomous territory. It was foolish to treat the Abyssinian dispute as a world problem. It was absurd to try to revive a dead country. The old world is now full of troubles and unrest, and there is no room for leisurely daydreaming. The diplomatic gallery in the Chamber was full today, with the German and Japanese ambassadors and the Austro-Hungarian minister all in attendance. (14th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Chamber of Deputies held an extraordinary meeting this afternoon and approved the order to annex Abyssinia and establish the Fascist Empire. The venue was decorated magnificently and solemnly. All deputies and observers wore Fascist uniforms. The cabinet ministers' seats were adorned with bright red roses, fragrant and full of life. Distinguished guests sat shoulder to shoulder on the podium, the most notable of whom were the ambassadors of Germany and Japan and the Austrian minister. The deputies' seats were full. When Prime Minister Mussolini arrived, the entire hall stood up to pay their respects, and all the deputies sang the Fascist Party anthem, the sound shaking the roof. Only one deputy spoke today, Terkwa, the chairman of the Association of Wounded Soldiers of the European War, who was blind. He said, "What European countries need from Italy is more than what Italy needs from Europe. The Abyssinian issue is merely a colonial issue. It is extremely arrogant to try to forcibly transform it into a world problem. Historical facts are the truth. Civilized people should be united. Anything that conflicts with these two principles is a true breach of contract. Otherwise, we do not know what a breach of contract is. Italy has now won, which proves that the reasons we hold are indeed unshakable and well-founded. On the contrary, those who accuse us of doing so are violating the truth and hindering peace, and will collapse on their own. We can wait with peace of mind." After Terkwa finished speaking, Prime Minister Mussolini immediately stood up and read the order issued on the ninth of this month, without delivering a speech. All the deputies then approved the order and adjourned the meeting. (14th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Italy Determined to Use All Its Strength to Maintain Its Gained Victory: Intensifying Sanctions Will Lead to War: Mussolini's Impassioned Statement</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini spoke to a reporter from the Paris Morning News today, saying that Italy had been satisfied after conquering Abyssinia and would henceforth devote itself to peace, but if anyone wanted to seize the results of Italy's victory, it would resist with all its strength. "Italy is a hard-working nation, and now it has legally satisfied its needs for survival. Of course, no one can doubt that Italy has enthusiastically turned to peace so that it can complete its hard work. I also hope for peace, but if anyone wants to seize the results of the victory we have won with countless sacrifices, we are already prepared. Abyssinia now completely belongs to Italy." Mussolini also said that when the countries were about to impose military sanctions on Italy at that time, he had stated that this move might create the danger of transforming the map of Europe. If the League of Nations intensifies economic sanctions against Italy again, he will still make this statement. Today, according to reliable sources, the Pope may crown King Victor Emmanuel III as Emperor of Abyssinia. It is said that the Vatican wants to send a representative, while the Italian Foreign Ministry insists that the Pope must perform the ceremony himself. If the Pope accepts this request, the coronation ceremony will be held at the Church of Santa Maria, not at St. Peter's Basilica, where the Pope is crowned. (14th National News Agency Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Republic of Central America: Guatemala Announces Withdrawal from the League of Nations: Geneva Does Not Pay Much Attention</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Central American country of Guatemala has now announced that it will withdraw from the League of Nations. The reasons are currently unknown, but its statement is on its way. (15th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here do not pay too much attention to the announcement by the Republic of Guatemala in Central America to withdraw from the League of Nations. When the League of Nations General Assembly passed sanctions last October, a small number of countries abstained from voting, and Guatemala was one of them. President Ubico of the country has always admired Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and sympathizes with Italy. There is nothing unusual about this. It is said that the Italian envoy Arocchi and his party were summoned back to their country on the 12th of this month. The Guatemalan government may have mistakenly believed that the country had decided to withdraw from the League of Nations, so it imitated it. This is not necessarily the case. However, Guatemala owes the League of Nations 200,000 francs in membership dues. According to Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, a member state's announcement of withdrawal must be made two years in advance and the obligations under the Covenant must be fulfilled before it can take effect. The arrears of membership dues must be paid in full within two years. (15th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Policy: Still Guided by the Spirit of the Covenant: Baldwin Advocates Reforming the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) The Conservative Women's Association recently held a meeting in Albert Hall, attended by more than 7,000 members. Prime Minister Baldwin delivered a speech, saying, "The spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations should still be the guiding principle of British foreign policy, and at the same time, if the order of Europe is to be maintained, the foreign policies of all countries should also be guided by this spirit." The audience applauded and cheered. The Prime Minister continued, saying that the League of Nations had implemented Article 16 of the Covenant on sanctions since last November, which was an attempt. "If the first attempt fails, it is not correct to say that the organization of the League of Nations is equivalent to being dead. I have never held this view. The Prime Minister then mentioned the issue of amending the Covenant, saying, "Like machinery, if it does not operate well and cannot meet our expectations, this does not mean that what we expect is like a mirage and cannot be achieved. On the contrary, those who operate this machinery should be patient and carefully inspect the machinery to find out where the problem lies, and then repair and improve it. Any changes that can make it more effective should be adopted. Do all countries in Europe want to participate in the collective security system and fulfill a part of their responsibilities? If so, then there is no distinction between the size and importance of the responsibilities that all participants should fulfill. It is unacceptable for a person to be named a participant but do nothing, but to say that all the work should be done by the British Navy alone is not the true meaning of collective security. The Prime Minister said that as far as economic sanctions are concerned, if they are not universally implemented, they are equivalent to zero and cannot be enforced.

<h3>After the Reorganization of the Austrian Cabinet, Foreign Policy Remains Consistent, Maintaining the Rome Three-Power Agreement to Ensure Security and Peace in Central Europe</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to semi-official sources, Italy feels no unease despite the reorganization of the Austrian cabinet. This is because Deputy Prime Minister Baron Fielers, Finance Minister Traxler, and Secretary-General of the State Council Chinaudo in the new cabinet are all fighters of the Home Guard. Furthermore, Chinaudo has been ordered to concurrently serve as Secretary-General of the Patriotic Front, succeeding Colonel Adam. Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg has also telegraphed Prime Minister Mussolini, stating that the new cabinet's foreign policy will still be based on the Italo-Austrian-Hungarian Three-Power Agreement, saying, "This is not only for the benefit of the three countries themselves but also for the interests of Central Europe." This demonstrates that Austria's foreign policy remains consistent and unchanged. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Vienna - Former Finance Minister and leader of the left-wing Catholic Social Party, Valmmer, told the Associated Press today that the Home Guard will be disbanded within a few weeks after Chancellor Schuschnigg's cabinet reshuffle yesterday, and it is expected that there will be no insubordination. However, the national army and police are now taking special precautions to prevent disturbances by reactionaries. After Schuschnigg reorganized the cabinet, the first measure was to express goodwill to Italy and Hungary. Schuschnigg today sent telegrams to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, expressing Austria's and his personal goodwill towards the two countries, and saying that he is determined to maintain the Rome Agreement and the friendship between the three countries to ensure peace in Central Europe. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Legal circles have generally praised Schuschnigg's new cabinet, saying that some members of the Home Guard previously insulted the Chancellor and Catholic labor groups last Sunday, which led to political tension. Now, since the establishment of the new cabinet, things have returned to calm. Furthermore, three members of the current cabinet are leading figures in the Home Guard, which is an important factor in stabilizing the political situation. It is rumored that former Foreign Minister Weidiger will be appointed as the new envoy to Italy, but confirmation is pending. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) In addition to being a sports leader, Stehemberg has lost all his positions and departed from here last night for Rome to participate in Sunday's international football match between Austria and Italy. According to well-informed sources, Stehemberg originally intended to go to Rome early this morning to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to seek his future assistance, but it is said that Mussolini has rejected his request and no longer considers Stehemberg to be his political comrade. Observers originally hoped that the Prime Minister would refute the opposition's attacks on the cabinet, but the result was that the Prime Minister did not do so, which was quite disappointing. On the opposition side, this further strengthened their argument that Britain lacks leadership talent, which is evidenced by this. For example, the Labor Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, commented on the Prime Minister's speech, saying that it was "both empty and lacking in conclusions, as if it came from the mouth of an old gentleman, its content lacking in thought, guidance, indecisiveness, and nothing to be taken." Most other newspapers, including the Daily Mail, believe that a cabinet reshuffle is not far away. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Prince Stehemberg went to Rome yesterday to preside over the football match between Italy and Austria. It is generally believed that although the Prince has resigned, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will still grant him an audience. Well-informed sources also said that the Prince still maintains a loyal attitude towards the new cabinet of his country and will surely be approved by Mussolini. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Ludwig, the director of the State Council's press office, recently announced to the press that Chancellor Schuschnigg will personally lead the Home Guard in the capacity of leader of the Patriotic Front. When Ludwig was asked whether the government planned to disarm the Home Guard, Ludwig replied in the negative, saying that the group could exist for a long time and would not be cut down. Finally, Ludwig announced that the government will promulgate laws to be included in the constitution to reform the organization of the Patriotic Front. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Plans to Propose a European Construction Plan, Including the Redistribution of Colonies, International Situation Is Unsettled, Delaying Reply to British Inquiries</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here recently announced that the German government is planning to propose a large-scale European construction plan, including all issues related to currency, raw materials, and the redistribution of colonies, to respond to the British questionnaire and advocate convening an international conference for discussion. Regarding this matter, Head of State Hitler has already contacted British Ambassador Sir Phipps during his invitation to meet yesterday and is expected to publish it in a short period of time.

<p>(Berlin) Hitler decided to postpone the response to the British government's inquiries because the international situation is still uncertain. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party's foreign affairs group recently hosted foreign newspaper reporters, and Goode, director of the Ministry of Interior's Health Department, was also present. He gave a speech, saying, "Once war is restarted, then regardless of the front or the rear, the most precious blood will be shed and will not stop until it is exhausted. The health of the nation and war are like water and fire, incompatible. Head of State Hitler knows very well that peace is not only necessary for us, but also related to the survival of the entire white race. Therefore, he is very eager for peace. If politicians from all countries in the world share the same sense of awareness as Germany, then they can better understand our Head of State's love of peace. In short, if European culture is to be maintained, it must cooperate with Germany. It is deeply hoped that all European nations will understand this." (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Negotiating a Mediterranean Pact, France Revives Old Proposal, Difficult to Achieve Due to British-Italian Opposition</h3>
<p>(London) In February of this year, French Foreign Minister Flandin proposed to Britain and Italy to establish a Mediterranean Pact, but it was rejected by both countries, resulting in its suspension. It is now heard that this proposal has been revived. Regarding this matter, political figures recently stated that Britain supports the idea of concluding a non-aggression and mutual assistance pact in the Mediterranean region, but Britain will resolutely reject any proposal that attempts to restrict the power of the British Navy in that region. Therefore, whether the Mediterranean Pact can be established depends on whether Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to use it to restrict the British Navy during future negotiations.

<h3>British Budget Leak Case, Thomas's Son Implicates His Father</h3>
<p>(London) The court is investigating the truth about the leak of budget secrets. Today, a broker named Mario Depet testified, which may force Colonial Secretary Thomas to resign from the cabinet. Mr. Depet said that a man named Howarden went to his office on April 20 and claimed to have definite news about the budget from a friend, and that his friend said that it was "told by his good friend Thomas." Before Mr. Depet testified, Mr. Thomas also testified, saying that as soon as he knew that this matter was related to him, he declared to Prime Minister Baldwin that he was implicated by his son, so no matter what, his son's actions must be investigated.

<h3>Impersonating the Secretary of the Abyssinian Representative, Three Swindlers Arrested, Counterfeit Passports Found</h3>
<p>(Geneva) A man named Basha Ulant, impersonating the Abyssinian representative to Germany and the secretary of the Abyssinian delegation to the League of Nations, was recently arrested here. Two accomplices, Frenchmen, were also arrested at the same time. According to police investigations, the three men stole a car, multiple fur coats, and a large amount of expensive perfume in Paris, loaded them into the car, and forged diplomatic passports as a talisman, and transported the above-mentioned stolen goods to Switzerland. Customs officials did not detect the forgery, so they were able to sell them. The three men attempted to contact the Italian delegation earlier this week, with Basha Ulant claiming that he was here to obstruct the actions of the Abyssinian representative Warde, in order to deceive the Italian representative. The matter was heard by the police, who arrested them. Twenty-seven forged Abyssinian passports and many visiting cards of members of the diplomatic corps were found in Basha's luggage.

<h3>Japanese House of Peers Member, Tsumura, Slanders Generals, Naval Minister Is Enraged, Tsumura Forced to Resign</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tsumura Shigeza of the Research Society made a statement in the House of Peers regarding the military, which became a problem. The House of Peers' Justice Society decided to propose a motion to punish Tsumura. Due to the serious nature of this problem, Tsumura submitted his resignation to Speaker Konoe on the morning of the 15th. (Allied News Agency Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers convened at 10:45 a.m. on the 15th. Because it was heard that the problem of Tsumura Shigeza's slip of the tongue was serious, the spectator seats were full, and a dozen or so army and navy generals also attended as spectators. After Speaker Konoe announced the opening of the meeting, Ida Iwanan of the Justice Society requested to speak, saying that there were regrettable points in Mr. Tsumura's speech yesterday. Now I propose a motion to punish Mr. Tsumura. More than half of the members expressed their support, so the motion to punish was established. (Allied News Agency Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Army Minister Terauchi refuted Mr. Tsumura's speech in the plenary session of the House as follows: "In Mr. Tsumura's speech at this meeting yesterday, regarding the opinion of the military, I very much hope to promote his reflection. Mr. Tsumura cited one or two special cases in the team to publicly express the view that the loyalty of generals is inferior to that of soldiers, which is considered a major insult to the generals of the national army, which is extremely regrettable. The loyalty of our generals and below is like hot iron. The generals bear the heavy responsibility of the unity of the army, and they always take the lead as the root of education and training for lower-ranking officers and soldiers. Judging from this incident, the high casualty rate of generals can prove this. Therefore, I believe that Mr. Tsumura's remarks have damaged the reputation of the entire army's officers and soldiers. The problem is serious, and I hope that he will reflect quickly." (Electric Communication News Agency Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The navy was extremely indignant about Tsumura Shigeza's slanderous speech against the generals in the House yesterday. The top management meeting was held yesterday, and the attitude was very strong, which could not be resolved by Tsumura's cancellation or apology. When Mr. Tsumura visited Naval Minister Nagano to apologize yesterday, the Naval Minister only dealt with him perfunctorily, but only promoted Tsumura's reflection. Depending on how Tsumura responds at today's meeting, we will strongly urge Mr. Tsumura to reflect deeply. Mr. Tsumura saw this dangerous situation and finally submitted his resignation this morning.

Today, the Punishment Committee of the House of Peers held a committee meeting, and Mr. Lv Tsumura has also lost his seat because of this. Therefore, by understanding this, everything has been in vain. (Electric Communication News Agency Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Plans to Solve the Food Problem, Mediating Food Storage and Grain, Undertaking Water Conservancy to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, According to the survey results, the rice fields in Guangdong Province total more than 26 million mu. However, there are fertile rice fields (the upper and middle parts of the Pearl River Delta), saline rice fields near the coast, alluvial plain rice fields along the rivers, and valley bottomland rice fields. However, for these more than 26 million mu, each mu produces two crops a year, with an average yield of 6 to 8 dan of rice (fertile rice fields can produce up to 12 dan per year). It is estimated that the entire province has a rice production of 156 million dan to 28 million dan. If it is milled into white rice, on average, 65% is used for calculation, there should be</p>

<p>The market situation was stable this morning. At 1 p.m., the transaction price for July and September was 7 and a half pence, which was 0625 higher than yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Futures were firm today due to good demand from the consumption side and better news from the French political situation. At the opening, the July period was 13 pounds higher than yesterday due to peer purchases, at 15.68. The upward trend did not weaken later, and near noon, the July period price was 15.74, 19 pounds higher than yesterday's closing price. The New York commodity market prices are listed on the left. 100 million to 135 million of white rice. The population of the whole province is more than 30 million people, and each person consumes 2.5 to 3 dan of rice per year. Guangdong should have a surplus of food. In addition, there are still many tidal fields in the south that have not been dyked and many fields in Qiongyai that have not been reclaimed but can be planted with rice. If they can be developed as much as possible, Guangdong seems to be able to become a rice-producing area like Siam and Annam. Looking at the facts, it is not like this. According to the investigation, the rice fields in the upper and middle parts of the Pearl River Delta have convenient irrigation and are not threatened by floods and droughts, and the harvest is very abundant, but only more than 4 million mu. The alkaline rice fields in the lower part of the Pearl River Delta have 2 million mu, and the irrigation is very inconvenient, and the harvest is less than half of that in the upper and middle parts. There are also more than 10 million mu of alluvial plain rice fields along the rivers, which are always suffering from floods, because the East River, North River, and West River converge in the Pearl River and enter the sea. However, the upper reaches of each river are mostly highlands and mountains, and there are no water source forest facilities, so the washed sand and stones flow down, causing the downstream to be silted up. In addition, it has not been dredged for hundreds of years, so floods have been caused. There are also more than 10 million mu of valley bottomland rice fields, which are located in highland areas and often suffer from drought. Based on these two, there are more than 20 million mu of rice fields, and their production is not standard. In better years, each mu can produce about 5 dan of rice per year, and in unfortunate times, each mu produces 2 to 3 dan per year for two crops a year. Based on this, the food in the whole province is not enough to supply. In peacetime, about 18 million dan of foreign rice is imported every year. If there are floods, more than 30 million dan of foreign rice is imported. This is a general situation of food in the whole province. Since food is insufficient, the imported ones are relied on by Siam and Annam. Very little is transported from Wuhu and Zhenjiang, probably because transportation is inconvenient and freight is high. If foreign rice is imported from Hong Kong, it is more convenient, but since foreign rice is used to supply, there is often a rice shortage. This is indeed a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently.</p>
<p>In the past two or three months, there has been a rice price panic. The government used various methods, such as prohibiting counties in rice-producing areas from exporting rice, the Food Adjustment Committee adjusted food in various places, and the Benevolence and Charity Hall allocated funds to purchase rice and grain, and held smooth sales to rice-scarce areas. Therefore, the rice price panic was quickly quelled. Now, the government is contacting rice merchants to purchase rice and grain from Hunan Province, and has sent personnel to Hunan to investigate. After the Yuehan Railway is opened to traffic, transportation will be convenient, and Hunan rice can be transported to Guangdong continuously, which can reduce foreign rice imports and reduce leakage, and also reduce the threat of food panic in times of emergency. At the same time, the government has also invested in purchasing miscellaneous grain seeds and distributing them to various counties for planting, in order to increase food production. The Food Adjustment Committee has also requested the provincial government to allocate 150,000 yuan to build grain storage warehouses in Qujiang, Ning, and Jieyang counties, and ordered the counties to restore grain warehouses and engage in grain storage for disaster preparedness. Guangdong was originally a rice-producing area, and there are so many rice fields, but because water conservancy is not prosperous, food is insufficient. The fundamental solution is to develop water conservancy to increase food production. Regarding the development of water conservancy, Guangdong originally had a River Management Committee, which was affiliated to the central government and allocated funds from the Geng funds every year. The committee hired foreign engineers to conduct measurements and prepared a great river management plan, but because the funds were not enough, the great project could not be carried out, and only some remedial work could be done, which could only slightly reduce the power of the floods, but could not completely eliminate the floods. As for agricultural irrigation water conservancy construction, it is even more impossible for the committee to take care of it. Therefore, Guangdong established a Water Conservancy Committee, which was jointly organized by senior officials from the provincial government, the Civil Affairs Department, the Finance Department, the Construction Department, the Military Reclamation Office, the River Management Committee, and the Central District Pacification Office. The committee has been established, the great water conservancy project is still handled by the River Management Committee, and the water conservancy undertakings of agricultural irrigation and drainage projects are actively planned and constructed by the Water Conservancy Committee. As for the government's plan to issue 10 million yuan to the committee for water conservancy expenses, 3 million yuan will be allocated to the Construction Department for developing aquatic products, silk, and cotton production. The issuance of rural construction treasury bonds is somewhat different from the issuance of ordinary bonds. The issuance of bonds is for the people to freely buy and sell and pay interest on time. Rural construction treasury bonds are used by agricultural producers to obtain treasury bonds from the government in accordance with the prescribed procedures and exchange them for cash at the bank. After the agricultural producers receive the cash, they will engage in water conservancy under the guidance of the Water Conservancy Committee. After two years, the production of the fields will increase and the income will increase, and then they will be repaid in installments. After repayment, the agricultural producers will benefit from it, and the larger projects on farmland will still be planned and built by the Water Conservancy Committee. After the construction, the tenant farmers and landlords in the area will repay in installments. In this way, the government will not spend huge expenses, and the farmers' income will increase, and there will be no loss. Naturally, they will be happy to receive it. In short, in the past two or three years, the Guangdong government has paid great attention to the development of agriculture, such as the establishment of agricultural schools, the organization of agricultural loans, the organization of rural cooperatives, as well as the improvement of sericulture and the promotion of sugar cane production, all of which have achieved significant results. Now, the development of water conservancy and the increase in production are aimed at solving the food problem in the whole province. (11th)</p>
<h3>Rural Life Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtang</p>
<p>The Life of Silkworm Farmers in the Huzhou Area of Zhejiang Province - Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>Revealing the farmers' speculation for the sake of livelihood: "Three sheets of rough cotton paper, three sheng of watermelon seeds; if good, build a house and marry a wife; if not, go to Shanghai to pull a rickshaw."</p>
<p>This is the most popular folk song in the rural areas of western Zhejiang. From this folk song, the enthusiasm of the farmers' speculative psychology is fully revealed. Originally, silkworm rearing and melon cultivation were both side businesses for farmers, and everyone considered them insignificant. However, the farm families in western Zhejiang reversed the priorities, believing that silkworm rearing could bring unexpected fortune. Therefore, in the past, they worked hard to promote mulberry land, and Huzhou became one of the important areas for Chinese silk. But since overseas silk prices have frequently fallen, the farmers in the silkworm rearing areas suddenly felt as if they had lost their center of gravity. Tracing back to the origin, it is probably the remaining poison of this folk song? However, the farmers do not regret the past, believing that what is lost in the east can be gained in the west. Therefore, they changed course and viewed melon cultivation as a way to make a fortune. However, the increase in melon fields was actually triggered by the bankruptcy of silkworm cocoons, and as a result of the sudden increase in watermelon production, the price of melons fell like a river flowing downward, ultimately accelerating the rapid decline of rural areas in the short term.</p>
<p>Paddy Fields are Gradually Shrinking</p>
<p>The expanse of mulberry land in the Huzhou area is truly boundless. Anyone who has been to western Zhejiang must have seen it. The farm families devote themselves wholeheartedly to the management of mulberry land, which can be understood by comparing it with paddy fields in the same position. Originally, the various prefectures of western Zhejiang have smooth rivers and are suitable for planting rice. However, because the farmers wanted to gradually improve their living conditions in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the area of mulberry land gradually increased, and the remaining paddy fields gradually narrowed. They thought that the rice produced by the paddy fields only needed to be enough to provide food for the whole family for a year, and all other expenses, such as land rent, field tax, and fertilizer, could be completely covered by silkworm rearing. Therefore, they usually paid close attention to cultivating mulberry land, even at the expense of cutting flesh to heal sores, turning the soil from the paddy fields onto the mulberry land, intending to make the mulberry trees, where the greatest profit lies, lush and green in an instant. Therefore, the mulberry land and paddy fields in the Huzhou area are often very different in height, which would surprise the people of Guizhou, who might wonder if there are terraced fields here.</p>
<p>Painfully Implementing Spending Tomorrow's Income Today</p>
<p>Not long ago, every spring, in the towns and cities of western Zhejiang, wherever merchants gathered, there was a seasonal trade, which was the unique mulberry saplings in the silkworm rearing area. Moreover, both the buyer and seller were farmers, so the mulberry saplings carried to the market from the countryside eventually returned to the countryside. The silkworm eggs transported from Yuhang and Shaoxing were also a significant business, but this created an opportunity for middlemen to exploit the farmers; because the silkworm eggs were transported from other places, they naturally had to change hands several times before reaching the farmers. As a result, a group of unscrupulous people took advantage of the farmers' poverty, wholesale a large number of silkworm eggs, and sold them on credit to the farm families, with a very short period and extremely high profits. Farmers who were unable to purchase them with cash had to painfully sacrifice. When the poor farm families reached the end of the year, because the collection of accounts and taxes was as urgent as a fire and they could not raise cash for a while, and especially in the biting cold winter, they could not pawn their broken cotton-padded jackets and old leather coats in order to protect the warmth of their bodies. Then they also imitated the government's method of issuing bonds, implementing spending tomorrow's income today, pre-selling the mulberry leaves for the coming spring. At that time, many capitalists rushed to buy them at a fixed price of two yuan per dan. Therefore, the farmers felt that planting mulberry trees was more meaningful because the income from the annual output of the mulberry land could be prepaid. The farmers who pre-sold the green leaves did not deeply understand that the prevalence of pre-selling was the most ruthless means of exploitation by capitalists? Even if they knew, what could they do? It should be known that the farm families who pre-sell green leaves are not truly surplus in mulberry leaves. Therefore, the more they sell in winter, the higher the degree of spending tomorrow's income today, and the more profound the economic pressure they feel. In order to eliminate this pain, the farm families still raise silkworms like crazy in the following spring, hoping to make a big profit. But we must understand that the most important and indispensable thing for silkworm rearing is mulberry leaves. Many farm families have already sold them all, and most of them are in the hands of capitalists during the silkworm season. The capitalists do not raise silkworms themselves, but completely monopolize them. Therefore, during the silkworm season, the mulberry leaves in the hands of capitalists are even more scarce, and the price of mulberry leaves also rises sharply, often soaring to seven or eight yuan per dan, which is also a common occurrence. Because farmers cannot delay feeding their silkworms, no matter how expensive they are, they have to buy them painfully. Think about how much money farmers have to lose for no reason after capitalists resell the same dan of mulberry leaves. However, the capitalists' desires are not yet satisfied!</p>
<p>"Adding a Dime" is a Long-Standing Practice in Western Zhejiang. Because of the urgent need for money at the end of the year, farmers had to pre-sell the green leaves for a loan. However, in the following spring, the farmers still had no production and were penniless. Silkworm eggs could still be borrowed on credit, but where could they raise capital to buy the expensive mulberry leaves? At this moment, the usurers showed their ferocious faces and exerted their supreme authority. They lent cash and rice to the farmers, agreeing to repay it when the fresh cocoons were sold. In a period of only twenty-odd days, how much interest would be added? It is truly shocking to say that for every ten silver dollars borrowed, an additional silver dollar of interest would be added. If calculated on an annual interest rate, it would reach more than 100%. How could the farmers not struggle below the poverty line? From this, the dryness of the rural economy can also be imagined. This name is called "adding a dime," and it has always been popular and known to everyone in western Zhejiang. Therefore, according to the estimates of rural farmers, each sheet of rough cotton paper can earn a profit of forty or fifty yuan at the lowest. However, with such heavy exploitation, let alone a mere forty or fifty yuan, even if they could earn ten thousand times their investment, it would only make the farmers work in vain, or even lose money.</p>
<p>There are Also Those Who are Bankrupted Due to Silkworm Rearing</p>
<p>Moreover, the farmers who can seek help from usurers are still better off than the poor farmers. Other more difficult farm families have no way to appeal, and no matter how high the interest they are willing to pay, it is difficult to fulfill their wishes. Then they really have no way. The mulberry leaves for feeding silkworms cannot be interrupted for a moment. When they reach this dead end, it is heartbreaking to say that they have to abandon part of the silkworms that are related to their livelihood. Isn't this loss the most regrettable? But there are also those who can borrow money but voluntarily abandon them. This is because the farmers adhere to the method of maintaining the status quo and have no grasp of silkworm affairs. If there are changes in the middle and they think the hope is dim, wouldn't it be futile to continue to cultivate them and only increase the amount of debt? So they have to give up with regret. Therefore, every New Year, the farmers want to know in advance what the result of the silkworm season will be, and they leave no stone unturned in seeking divination. However, we must understand that the first thing for silkworm rearing is to have a large space, and the prevention of wind, rain, thunder, and the regulation of severe cold and heat are even more closely related. Who knows that most of the houses where farm families live are only broken houses that can shelter from wind and rain, and the simplicity of the equipment is self-evident. Such a contradictory environment is undeniably unsuitable. Moreover, farm families are extremely taboo about everything during the silkworm season. During the tense moment, even outsiders are not allowed to rashly enter the house, which shows the lack of research and discussion on silkworm rearing methods. In this way, farm families are not fully equipped before raising silkworms, and no one instructs them on the spot, so it is difficult to save them afterward. As a result, the bad news of the silkworm season is often heard in our ears, and it is also common to hear of those who are bankrupted due to silkworm rearing.</p>
<p>Abandon Silkworm Rearing to Grow Melons</p>
<p>Most of the cultivated land of farm families in the silkworm rearing area is mulberry land. Now, the mulberry land is also due to the pre-sale of green leaves, and fresh cocoons are only worth more than ten yuan, which is not enough to offset the land rent of the mulberry land itself. Then, it is of course impossible for the whole family's livelihood to rely on the very small area of paddy fields to support them. Therefore, the rise of melon fields can also be said to have met the opportunity. However, there are still two reasons why melon fields can continue to flourish after the silkworm business: growing melons is just like raising silkworms, it is a career with great gains and losses, and those who are disappointed in raising silkworms can bet everything on this. As the lives of farmers become increasingly difficult, the opportunity for capital circulation is also equivalent to being cut off. Therefore, the farmers' urgency for money is not the same as in the past when they could borrow here and there. If you want to solve this problem, you have to make up for this shortcoming with things that have a relatively short harvest period. In addition to silkworms, only watermelons are fast enough. However, because of purchasing power, the proceeds from selling melons are often only enough to cover the cost of fertilizer!</p>
<p>These are All Powerful Symbols of Rural Decline. The season for silkworm rearing is approaching again, and the time for growing melons is also approaching soon. After suffering many wounds, the farm families should be able to realize that this road is not a way to make a fortune; all hopes of gradually improving clothing, food, housing, and transportation are just illusions. If this continues, they will have to sell their cultivated land (most of the farmland in western Zhejiang has perpetual ownership, so even if it is rented, it can still be bought and sold) to repay their debts, and they really have to go to pull a rickshaw. However, from promoting mulberry land to reducing paddy fields, it was already a morbid state of the rural economy. Now, expanding melon fields again, making the production of rice even less, can be said to be a powerful symbol of rural decline. The difficulty of the people's food may also stem from this!</p>

<h3>Chaozhou and Shantou Native Sugar Prices Plummet Due to the Impact of Smuggled Sugar; Unable to Be Distributed and Exported</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Chaozhou is a sugarcane producing area. In recent years, the government has increased sugar taxes. Every year, Chaozhou sugar is transported to Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places, reaching more than one million dan. The rural economy relies on this to recover. Recently, in Hebei Province, Japanese ruffians have been smuggling large quantities of white sugar to Tianjin and distributing it to the northern provinces. The transportation of Chaozhou sugar to the north has been fundamentally hit. Last month, the Shantou Native Sugar Association received a telegram from the Tianjin Chaozhou Merchants Association, stopping the transportation of sugar to the north. The telegram briefly stated that there were 220,000 bags of foreign sugar piled up in the foreign warehouses in a certain concession in Tianjin, and more than 50,000 bags of Chaozhou native sugar stored in the warehouses, which could not be sold. After receiving the telegram, the Shantou Native Sugar Association stopped purchasing native sugar from various counties. Two months ago, native sugar in Jieyang Mianhu and other places could be sold for 11 yuan in legal tender (i.e., 8.8 yuan in silver dollars) per hundred catties. After May, it plummeted to 9 yuan in legal tender (7.2 yuan in Taiwan silver dollars), equivalent to about 6 yuan in big silver dollars. With such a market situation, farmers and merchants are lamenting bitterly. Moreover, Chaozhou sugar is mostly liquid and has a yellow mud-like shape. If the weather is hot, it will inevitably melt into water if it is stored in the warehouse. Farmers are eager to sell it, so its price is expected to fall again. It is found that the sugar industry in Guangdong Province is currently in its infancy. As far as Chaozhou and Shantou are concerned, because the price of native sugar has fallen, it affects the sales of the provincial-run Five Rams brand white sugar. The public sale price of provincial-run white sugar is about 22 legal tender per dan, while the price of native sugar is 9 legal tender per dan, a difference of half. The Guangdong Provincial Assembly and the Shantou Native Sugar Association and other groups have recently heard news of a reduction in the import tax on foreign sugar, and therefore issued a protest telegram to maintain the domestic sugar industry, indirectly to save the economic lifeline of the rural areas of Chaozhou.</p>
<h3>Nanjing's Educational Administration Plan for the 25th Year Especially Emphasizes Vocational Education, Establishes Advanced Industrial Schools, and Completes the Initial Universalization of Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Nanjing's educational administration plan for the 25th year has been drafted by the city's Social Affairs Bureau. Regarding secondary education, it is planned to especially emphasize vocational education and establish advanced industrial vocational schools. Regarding primary education, it is planned to complete the initial universalization of compulsory education in the capital within the 25th year. No matter how difficult the city's finances are, the bureau expects this plan to be completed. As for social education, it is planned to take the implementation of compulsory adult literacy education as the central task. The following is a separate explanation:</p>
<p>Regarding Secondary Education: In addition to the various private, national, and provincial schools in Nanjing, there was only one municipal No. 1 Middle School in the 23rd year. In the 24th year, the municipal No. 2 Middle School and Normal School were added, and the original vocational supplementary school was reorganized into a junior vocational school. In the 25th year, in addition to increasing the grades of the original schools, it is planned to add an advanced industrial vocational school, or the No. 3 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, and girls' middle school. If the economic strength does not allow it, it will be considered and handled again. The development of secondary education in Nanjing in the past three years has the following statistics: In the 23rd year, there were 625 students and an expenditure of 62,172 yuan. In the 24th year, the number of students increased to 1,181 and the expenditure increased to 145,816 yuan. In the 25th year, according to the drafted plan, the number of students can be increased to 2,141 and the expenditure increased to 257,476 yuan. It is also planned to provide appropriate subsidies to private middle schools with excellent results. An appropriation of 10,000 yuan has been included in the subsidy fee. The standards for excellence are determined by (A) the joint examination, (B) the sampling examination, (C) training management, and (D) other four items. According to the original junior vocational schools in Nanjing, the equipment is simple. At the same time, the need for vocational education in society is very urgent. According to the standards set by the Ministry of Education, the percentage of vocational education expenditure in the total secondary education expenditure in various places should not be less than 35% by the 26th year. Although Nanjing cannot immediately reach this standard, it is hoped that it can be increased as much as possible. It is currently planned to ask the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to allocate funds for subsidies, and at the same time, it is hoped that the Ministry of Education can allocate more funds to subsidize the vocational education expenditure in the capital. In addition, it is planned to continue to actively promote the improvement of private middle school equipment and the improvement of the teachers of municipal private secondary schools.</p>
<p>Regarding Primary Education: It is still the central task of the next year. 60% or 70% of the effort will be spent on primary education. According to the population of Nanjing, there is an annual increase, which has now exceeded one million. The number of school-age children has also increased sharply. In February of this year, the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau investigated school-age children in the city. The investigation of the urban area has now been completed. There are a total of 79,651 school-age children in the urban area. The rural area is currently in progress. According to the preliminary and convenient investigation by the Baojia chiefs in various rural areas, there are about 21,588 people. There are a total of 101,239 people. Among them, about 60,155 are enrolled in schools and about 41,184 are out of school. In addition to the recent addition of some short-term primary schools that can accommodate thousands of students, there should be more than 30,000 children out of school. Therefore, the central issue of the educational administration plan for the 25th year is how to solve the enrollment problem of these more than 30,000 children out of school. Among these more than 30,000 children out of school, some are mobile and some have become street beggars due to poverty. Therefore, in the 25th year, it is planned to implement compulsory education based on this situation. It is found that the development of primary education in Nanjing in the past three years has the following statistics: In the 23rd year, there were 115 primary schools, 35,547 students, and a monthly expenditure of 57,371 yuan. In the 24th year, it increased to 200 schools, 60,776 students, and a monthly expenditure of 89,392 yuan. In the 25th year, according to the drafted plan, it will increase to 277 schools, which can accommodate more than 100,000 students, and the monthly expenditure will be 125,022 yuan. According to the plan for the initial universalization of compulsory education formulated by the Ministry of Education, the children who are compulsorily enrolled are temporarily set to be 9 to 12 years old. Therefore, children out of school under the age of 9 can be temporarily delayed from enrolling. In this way, the plan for the initial universalization of compulsory education in Nanjing can be easily completed within the 25th year. According to the plan for the universalization of compulsory education formulated by the Ministry of Education, for remote provinces, it is divided into five or six or seven years. For provinces with more developed cultures and sufficient funds, the time limit can be shortened. Now, the Nanjing Municipal Government hopes to complete this plan within two years. Therefore, special attention will be paid to this matter in the 24th and 25th years. (3) Regarding Social Education: Taking the implementation of compulsory adult literacy education as the central task. It is found that in the first semester of the 24th year, there were a total of 14 private schools and 48 people's night schools, totaling 62 schools, with 4,500 students enrolled and 3,651 students graduating. In the second semester, there were still 14 private schools, and the number of people's night schools increased to 62. Together with 37 other public and private people's night schools, there were a total of 7,554 students enrolled. The number of graduates cannot be counted because the semester has not ended. The outline for handling compulsory literacy education in the 25th year has been approved by the Ministry of Education. Based on this outline, it is currently planned to first establish a compulsory literacy education committee. In terms of funding, it is also planned to ask the Ministry of Education to provide appropriate subsidies, and it is also planned to ask various agencies, schools, and guilds to raise funds on their own to run people's schools. In the first semester of the 25th year, it is planned to establish 400 classes for compulsory literacy education, with 50 people in each class, which can accommodate about 20,000 people. As for other social education undertakings, such as enriching and improving the people's education centers, facilities, sorting out the Jiulongqiao swimming pool, promoting and improving educational films, preparing for the establishment of public sports fields, children's parks, and swimming pools, gyms, investigating and sorting out various cultural groups in the city, etc., it is planned to actively carry out. (4) Regarding Education Funding: Although the city's finances are in a very difficult situation, it has been increasing year by year. There will be more increases in the 25th year. It is estimated that the recurrent expenditure for school education in the 24th year was 1,181,254 yuan, and it is planned to be 1,761,346 yuan in the 25th year, an increase of 580,092 yuan. The recurrent expenditure for social education in the 24th year was 127,136 yuan, and it is planned to be 189,384 yuan in the 25th year, an increase of 62,248 yuan. In addition, the temporary expenses such as building school buildings and purchasing school land will have to be increased by 641,670 yuan in the 25th year. Therefore, the education funding must be increased by 1.2 million yuan in the 25th year.</p>
<h3>Hubei Rural Miscellany</h3>
<p>— (Our Special Correspondent, Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>(10) Severe Spring Famine in Anlu</p>
<p>Having completed my investigations in southern Hubei, and eager to depart for northern Hubei and then proceed to western Hubei, I was delayed until May 5th due to incessant rains that blocked the roads. Only then could I take a short-distance ticket train on the Pinghan Railway from Hankou northward. Passing through Xiaogan County, I alighted at Huayuan and transferred to a car for Anlu. I arrived in the county town at four in the afternoon. No sooner had I settled into my lodging than a heavy rain began. “One day of false sunshine, nine days of gloom,” it truly left travelers with mixed feelings of laughter and tears.</p>
<p>Anlu is located in northern Hubei. During the Qing Dynasty, it was a prefecture capital. The area spans 120 li from east to west and 70 li from north to south, longer in the northwest and narrower in the southeast, forming an oblique triangle. The total area is over 9,350 square li. It borders Sui County, Yingcheng, Yingshan, Xiaogan, Jingshan, and Yunmeng counties. In the northwest, there is the Dahong Mountain range with dense peaks and secluded valleys. Its eastern part is a branch of the range, with undulating hills. The south ends in a plain. The railway runs through it. It is said, "Controlling the three passes to the north, connecting Jianghan to the south, residing on the left flank of Xiangfan, and dominating the upper reaches of Huang'e," which describes the strategic location of northern Hubei. Since 1927, the Red bandits have been rampant, spreading their poison almost throughout the province. However, this county was not disturbed. The people did not hear the sounds of war, and to this day, except for sporadic bandits appearing in the western border area bordering Jingshan and Sui counties, all the townships in the east, south, and north are extremely peaceful. The total population of the county is 51,476 households, totaling 286,013 people. Farmers account for nine-tenths of the population. There are 393,013 mu of arable land. The main agricultural products are rice and wheat, followed by soybeans and cotton. Two crops are harvested each year, yielding about two dan of rice per mu, a little over one dan of wheat, and over 30 jin of cotton. Besides self-sufficiency, some can be sold to other counties. The initial area of cultivated land is calculated in dan and dou, without strict standards. Generally, one dan of land is equivalent to four mu. The government is currently conducting land registration and will carry out a thorough survey. Because of a lack of prior publicity, farmers do not understand the meaning, leading to many obstacles. In fact, many people's land has been occupied for road construction, resulting in taxes without land. A thorough survey and registration are necessary. The value of land varies. The eastern townships have poor soil, with each mu worth about 20-30 yuan. Land near the city can be worth 40 yuan. The northern townships are the most fertile, and land prices are also the highest, with each mu worth about 70 yuan. The southwestern townships are worth 50-60 yuan. However, there are also distinctions between "wide land," "narrow land," "full grain," and "empty grain," and the value varies accordingly. The number of owner-farmers, semi-owner-farmers, and tenant farmers is roughly equal. The distribution of agricultural products is four to the landlord and six to the tenant in the east, which is quite harmonious. Hired laborers and landlords are especially harmonious, like family and father and son, showing that the folk customs are still simple. The terrain is very high, so there is no fear of floods. The entire county has only one dam, and the people do not pay much attention to it. The Yun River comes from Sui County, running north and south, and the people's fields on both banks rely heavily on irrigation. Although it sometimes overflows, because it is a mountain flood, it recedes very quickly, still not harming the harvest. The burden of donations and taxes on farmers used to be numerous, too many to list. Now they have been merged into four categories: land tax, mu tax, county administration tax, and education tax. The tax is over three jiao per mu, and the people all pay into the treasury themselves. There is no pursuing or shouting by clerks, and no grasping of grain books. Those that belonged to the harsh and miscellaneous have mostly been abolished in compliance with the order. However, in the four townships around Zhaoshan, there are 200 large and small lime kilns. The business tax bureau collects kiln donations, 20 yuan for large ones, over 10 yuan for medium ones, and 7-8 yuan for small ones. It is said that after collecting the donations, no receipts were given, which inevitably makes the people uneasy.</p>
<p>The county has neither banditry nor floods, so it seems to be called a paradise. However, the rural economy is inevitably exhausted. What is the reason? One is the sluggish sales of native cloth and the cessation of handicrafts. The other is the continuous drought, followed by the spring famine. The county's agricultural products, in addition to rice, wheat, cotton, and soybeans, have no other by-products. Handicraft industry supplements the economy. The most notable is native cloth, also known as "fu cloth". Both the warp and weft are coarse yarn, which can be worn for a long time without wearing out. Farmers are diligent and hard-working. During their spare time from farming, men and women often weave cloth with native looms. Within the four borders, the sound of looms can be heard. The annual output at its peak reached over 100,000 bundles, each bundle containing 32 bolts, each bolt valued at one yuan to one yuan and forty-five jiao, sold in Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and other places, worth one to two million taels of silver. However, because they stick to native methods and do not know how to use machines, foreign goods are dumped, and native cloth is eliminated. In recent years, the number of production and sales is less than 4,000 bundles, only one-twentieth of what it was in the past. Moreover, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai markets have increased taxes, further increasing costs and hindering sales. Under this double whammy, native cloth is on the verge of extinction. Farmers are unable to hoard it and only seek to sell it at a loss, and the labor is thrown into a void, greatly affecting the rural economy. Now, farmers are striving to improve quality in order to compete with foreign goods. At the same time, they are telegraphing appeals to the government to stop Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces from collecting taxes. Gansu has agreed to exempt them, but Qinghai and Shaanxi are still hesitant. Reviving the cloth industry may not yet be the time. As for the repeated droughts and severe spring famine, they are the urgent problems to be solved. The county suffered severe droughts in the past two years, with agricultural losses of 70-80%. The provincial government allocated funds for relief and organized relief efforts, including emergency relief, labor relief, and agricultural relief. Emergency relief amounted to 5,000 yuan, labor relief to 8,000 yuan, and agricultural relief to several thousand yuan. These were organized by the government, party headquarters, legal authorities, and faculty and staff of county middle schools. Emergency relief amounted to one yuan per person, collected upon presenting a household plaque, without the intervention of baojia chiefs. Labor relief was one jiao per work unit, and included dredging 63 school ponds and newly building seven standard ponds. Agricultural relief involved distributing seeds, four dou for large households and two dou for small households, completed from last winter to this spring, which was quite practical. At the same time, the Farmers Bank of China loaned over 20,000 yuan, which was also a small supplement. After a major disaster, the people have little savings and deeply hoped for the spring harvest to make up for it. Unexpectedly, in recent months, incessant rains and two major windstorms and hailstorms swept from west to east. Within dozens of li, the wheat was devastated, even uprooted in severe cases, and rice seedlings were also severely damaged. The spring famine suddenly appeared, and grain prices soared. Each dan of rice has now risen to ten yuan, rice to nineteen yuan and six jiao per dan, wheat to over five yuan per dan, and there is nothing to buy. The county has 1,300 dan of grain in the county granary and 2,800 dan in the district granaries, all of which have been opened. The grain from the district granaries is loaned to the farmers, and the grain from the county granary is used for price stabilization, which is not enough for five days of food. Various agencies and legal entities sent personnel to Sui County to purchase rice, but because the export of rice was prohibited, negotiations were still needed, and the people's food panic was already imminent. On the 60 li trip from Huayuan to Anlu, there were more beggars than crucian carp crossing the river. Even if I gave them one copper coin, I would be surrounded by other beggars, incessantly begging. The Wang Yizhen shop area in the western townships was the most severely affected. The disaster victims eat old tree bark and wheat bran. Rice-looting incidents occurred on both sides of the Fu River. If relief is not sought early, security will be endangered. On the 6th, the rain cleared up. I wanted to go to Sui County, but the bus station posted a sign saying that the roads were muddy and the buses were suspended. So I went to the nearby suburbs to investigate. The barley in the fields was half ripe, and the green ones also accounted for half. The farmers were overjoyed to see the sunrise. They said that if it was sunny for seven consecutive days, the ripe ones could be harvested. If it was sunny for ten consecutive days, the green ones could also ripen. The spring famine could still be salvaged. My future is unimaginable. The folk customs here are generally simple and cautious, but the north is slightly fierce and the south is slightly cunning. Local tyrants and evil gentry are not common. Most of the baojia chiefs are illiterate, and government orders are not easy to implement, but they are not extremely evil, so the people are still happy to support them. Recently, employees of the land registration office set up by the Finance Department in Liutong and Liuxingmiao beat up a bao chief, arousing public anger. Over a thousand farmers gathered and forcibly released the bao chief, almost leading to a bloody incident. Afterwards, the director of the office said that he had suffered losses and ordered the people to compensate 500 yuan to settle the case, which is now being spread across the fields, with one jiao extracted for every dou of land, causing much resentment. Although the opium ban is strict, those who smoke still do so. It is heard that there are still two opium shops and dozens of opium dens in the county seat, and the smokers are all wealthy young men. Farmers rarely have this habit. In the midst of shock, I am slightly comforted. (Sent from Anlu on May 6th)</p>
<h3>Amoy Executes Criminals for Kidnapping and Murdering Filipino Overseas Chinese. Son of Filipino National Zeng Tingquan Kidnapped and Murdered by Bandits. Four Criminals Executed by Firing Squad, One of Whom Was Filipino.</h3>
<p>Amoy Correspondence, May 10. Amoy executed three major criminals, Wang Mai, Ye Nie, and Bo Luo, by firing squad for the kidnapping and murder of Filipino overseas Chinese Zeng Guoliang. This case has attracted the attention of southern Fujian society and people in the Philippines. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Previously, Zeng Tingquan, the commander of the First Brigade of the Philippine National Defense Forces, was of Chinese descent. His ancestors were overseas Chinese who were born overseas for several generations, and became Filipino citizens. As for Zeng Tingquan, although he himself was Filipino, he participated in the affairs of his ancestral country and the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. He served as the chairman of the Philippine Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association. His son, Zeng Guoliang, 19 years old, was sent back to Amoy to study at Taoyuan School in order to learn Chinese and receive education in his ancestral country, so as not to forget his roots. Last winter, Zeng Guoliang suddenly disappeared in Amoy. Zeng Tingquan sent his brother, Zeng Huijunsheng, Zeng Weishenzhi, and Yang Yuhua, to Amoy to investigate. Although they received a ransom note, they did not know his whereabouts. After a long time, Zeng Guoliang's body was discovered near Shishi outside the South Gate of Quanzhou. He had been strangled to death and buried. This spring, the Amoy Public Security Bureau arrested the main culprits, Wang Mai, Ye Nie, Lin Zichao, and Filipino Bo Luo, and arrested the suspects Xu Heng, Xu Hu, Xu Heng, Lin Cheng, and Sun Diaoyang in Quanzhou. They were handed over to the Military Law Department of the Pacification Commissioner's Office for trial. Wang, Ye, and Bo Luo were sentenced to death, Lin Zichao to twelve years in prison, and Xu, Lin, and the other five were acquitted and released. However, the masterminds of the case were Xu Rong and Li Wenkun. Xu was originally an overseas Chinese in the Philippines, engaged in business. The National Salvation Association repeatedly cracked down on Xu and others smuggling a large amount of enemy goods and confiscated them for public use in 1932 and 1933, causing Xu heavy losses. His business closed down and he returned to Quanzhou, bearing a deep grudge against Tingquan. Last winter, he bought Wang and others for 1,500 yuan to kidnap Zeng Guoliang. The next day, they secretly took him to Quanzhou and strangled him to death near Shishi in revenge on Tingquan by harming his son. After Guoliang was kidnapped, the US Consul in Amoy, representing the Philippine government, repeatedly wrote to our government to rescue and arrest the murderers. After Wang Mai and others were arrested, the US Consul again sent personnel with documents to the Pacification Commissioner's Office to request permission to attend the hearing. After the case was adjudicated, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, because Bo Luo was a US national, wrote to the US Consul for verification. The reply stated that there was no name of Bo Luo in the US consulate's register of nationals, and he did not have a Philippine government passport to come to Amoy. Therefore, he was executed along with Wang and Ye. When the Zeng case first arose, Filipinos largely thought of it as an anti-Filipino act, brewing anti-Chinese sentiments. The authorities’ full legal punishment of this case relieved the Filipinos. Zeng Junsheng, Zeng Weishenzhi, and Yang Yuhua expressed their gratitude to the municipal government and public security bureau after witnessing the execution of Wang and others, and returned to the Philippines on the 13th. However, the US Consul still demanded a strict investigation and handling of the masterminds Xu Rong and Li Wenkun. (May 14)</p>
<h3>Suzhou. Provincial Committee Studies Farmer Uprising Disputes</h3>
<p>In the early part of this month, farmer uprisings broke out in Xiexu, Chefang, and Guoxiang villages in Wu County, leading to clashes between farmers and security teams. After the uprisings subsided, Zhang Qianli, a rent collection commissioner from the Ninth District, drafted four measures, ordering the villagers to pay off the overdue rent rice for 1935 by May 21st. He also set a standard for converting rice to cash, with a deduction of 1 jiao 5 fen. To strictly enforce the collection, he sent security teams to assist and threatened to use armed force if necessary, or if the farmers were not genuinely impoverished and deliberately resisted rent, they would be arrested and forced to pay. These measures were approved by the county government and announced to the villages for farmers to follow. Until now, only a few farmers in the villages have paid their rent to the rice collection stations, and the total rent rice collected in the county for 1935 is only about 50%. County Magistrate Deng feels deeply troubled by the rent collection problem, and the rent collection stations set up by various rice merchants in the villages have not been successful, wasting more than 1,000 yuan in start-up costs. Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that this unfortunate event should not have occurred in the county's farmer uprising. In order to prevent further disputes between landlords and tenants, he has been visiting leaders of relevant agencies and reviewing files on farmer uprisings and disputes between landlords and tenants in various villages, and is quite busy. The causes of the disputes are now clear. In order to solicit the opinions of tenants, he took a car to Weiting village on the 15th for an on-the-spot investigation and to conduct further research. He will visit Xietang and other villages for investigation today and tomorrow. After the investigation is completed, he will draft a compromise plan for the province to approve and implement in order to quell the disputes.</p>
<h3>New Proposal for the Barber Industry</h3>
<p>The barber industry here has seen a sharp decline in business since the New Life Movement implemented a ban on women's perms, and the public security bureau sealed up electric perm equipment in each household. Therefore, they propose that women have short hair that does not hang past the ears or collar. This would not only be aesthetically pleasing but also require frequent trimming, potentially generating more business. For those who have previously had electric perms, they can have their hair straightened with iron tongs, so that in six months, women with permed hair will no longer be seen on the streets. This proposal has been submitted to the county party headquarters for approval.</p>
<h3>Inspecting the Dredging Project in Ducun Village</h3>
<p>Construction Bureau Director Cao, considering that the official river in Ducun village, Hengjing township, is an important waterway into Taihu Lake but has been severely silted due to years of disrepair, initiated a project to dredge it to improve transportation. Since the start of construction one month ago, the weather has been continuously rainy, affecting the work progress. In order to supervise the project, Director Cao, accompanied by Special Commissioner Sun Dan of the County Party Headquarters, went to Ducun on a motorboat on the morning of the 15th to inspect the river works and urge the foremen to complete the work within one month. Director Cao returned to Suzhou that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Preventing the Enclosure of Taihu Lake Farmland</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Xu of Wujiang County, based on reports that some people have recently been enclosing lake farmland in the southern Taihu Lake area bordering Wu County and Wujiang County, in addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to investigate and stop it, has also consulted the Wu County government to assist in preventing the enclosure of lake farmland in order to emphasize provincial orders and avoid further major disputes.</p>
<h3>Kunshan Holds Seventh Administrative Conference</h3>
<p>The seventh administrative conference of this county was held at the county government at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th. The opening ceremony was held, emphasizing the importance of the administrative conference, followed by speeches by representatives of various agencies. The ceremony ended at 10:00 a.m. A preparatory meeting was held at 11:00 a.m. to elect a vice chairman and designate members and directors of five groups: civil affairs, finance, education, construction, agriculture, forestry, and land. The first general assembly was held in the afternoon to discuss proposals. On the 15th, the second and third general assemblies were held in the morning and afternoon. After the fourth general assembly was held on the morning of the 16th, the resolution was read in the afternoon, and the closing ceremony was held. A total of 65 members attended this conference. A total of 74 proposals were discussed and completed in four general assemblies. The concrete methods decided upon will be faithfully implemented by the county government separately.</p>
<h3>Bandits Search and Plunder Farmhouses</h3>
<p>At midnight on the 13th of this month, more than ten bandits armed with weapons suddenly broke into the home of farmer Zhang Baiyin in Zhangjia village, Zhangpu township, Sixth District. The family members woke up from their dreams and hurriedly fled to other places. The bandits rummaged through boxes and cabinets, robbing cash, foreign clothes, etc., worth about 900 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changshu. Detaining a Suspect Who Was Collecting Coins</h3>
<p>It was reported that someone has recently been collecting coins from shops and residents in the area outside the East Gate, adding four or five cents per yuan. The Public Security Bureau paid special attention after receiving the report. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 14th, a patrol officer from the Third Precinct arrested a person who was collecting coins. A search of his body revealed 59 yuan in collected coins and another 500 yuan in banknotes prepared for exchange. After being detained by the bureau, he confessed that his name was Pan Zhiyuan, a native of Xinzhuang, and that he was 24 years old. He works at the Liyuan Qianzhuang in Hongkou, Shanghai. He was instructed by the shop owner, Chen Jinhai, to come to Changshu to collect coins. The shop has been engaged in this profession, sending many people out to collect coins. According to the confession, the Public Security Bureau, fearing that this person had established an organization in Changshu, in addition to sending the arrested suspect to the county, will conduct a secret investigation and handle it.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise in the Soy Sauce Industry</h3>
<p>In this county's soy sauce industry, there are two major factions: the soy sauce manufacturers and the soy sauce dealers. The former produces and sells homemade goods, while the latter specializes in chemical soy sauce. Recently, the market has been flooded with chemical soy sauce. The soy sauce manufacturers have petitioned, requesting a ban on chemical soy sauce, which has been found to be toxic. The public was agitated for a while. However, the soy sauce dealers, in order to protect their business, also sent representatives, such as Cheng Liqing, to the county party headquarters to petition, reporting that chemical soy sauce is made by mixing gluten, hydrochloric acid, sodium, etc., and that the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Testing Institute has issued a testing license stating that it is not toxic. Therefore, both sides have their own reasons, and the party headquarters is now mediating.</p>
<h3>Flowering of the Tang Osmanthus at Xingfu Temple</h3>
<p>In the garden outside the Precept Hall of Xingfu Temple outside the North Gate, there is an ancient Osmanthus tree, said to have been planted in the Tang Dynasty, hence the name Tang Osmanthus. It has now been over 1,100 years old, is several zhang tall, and has not been destroyed by disasters. It is recorded in various books and magazines, so foreign tourists who visit the temple must go to admire this ancient Tang Osmanthus tree. According to the people in the temple, although the tree is over a thousand years old, it still blooms every year around the Mid-Autumn Festival, with a unique fragrance. Yesterday, the people in the temple declared that the Tang Osmanthus tree had suddenly bloomed in recent days, with flowers covering the tree and a clear fragrance that could be smelled, which everyone called a miracle. As a result, curious people went to visit, and superstitious people believed that this was an ominous sign.</p>
<h3>Wuxi. Foundry Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The case of the work stoppage by foundry workers in this county has been resolved. The county party headquarters summoned representatives of the employers for talks and persuaded them to resume work first. As for the reinstatement of workers who were laid off for no reason, the party headquarters will summon the responsible persons from both labor and management to mediate impartially at 10:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month. At 7:00 a.m. on the 15th, the workers of all foundry factories resumed work uniformly.</p>
<h3>Regulating the Number of Silkworm Incubation Stoves</h3>
<p>The silkworm model area in this county, based on the number of spring silkworm seeds sold this time, 300,000 sheets, estimates that it can produce more than 100,000 dan of fresh cocoons. The number of silkworm incubation stoves to be opened should be doubled compared with last year. This has been presented to the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association for approval. It is heard that the number of stoves has been approved by the province for 2,500. The price of autumn silkworm seeds is set at 4 jiao 5 fen per sheet. Yesterday it was learned that the spring silkworms in the Zhangjingqiao area of the Sixth District have reached the third molt, and the silkworms in the Gaojiajian, Beiqifang, and Fuzhoucun areas of the Ninth District are also entering the third molt and beginning to feed. It is expected that they will be ready to spin cocoons in late May.</p>
<h3>Changzhou. The Situation of Young Silkworms in the Four Villages Is Still Good</h3>
<p>The Wuyi Sericulture Improvement District has established 42 silkworm rearing guidance stations in the county, and personnel have been dispatched to work separately. It is heard that the temperature outside this spring is relatively high, and the spring silkworm seeds hatch in an average of only five or six days. Due to the climate, mulberry leaves are also growing vigorously. After receiving the young silkworms, there were continuous rainy days. However, according to the inspection of He Zhaoxi, the deputy director of the Improvement District, the development of the young silkworms reared in common by the stations has not been affected in the slightest. The young silkworms reared in common by the stations have already reached the third instar and are feeding. In principle, they can be distributed to silkworm farmers to raise themselves. However, in order to prevent changes in the climate, the distribution is being delayed slightly. It is expected that the quality of this spring silkworm will be optimistic, as long as there are no special external encounters.</p>
<h3>Haizhou. Service by Attendants on the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway Bureau recently found that most of the attendants used on trains along the route in the past were uneducated, and therefore were often arrogant to passengers, greatly affecting service. In order to rectify the business, the bureau specially recruited dozens of attendants, set up a training center, and those who are qualified have graduated from junior high school. Now that the recruited attendants have completed their training, they have been assigned to work on trains along the route to provide service.</p>

The funds for the militia reserve team will be transferred from the original merchant corps funds and distributed and managed by the county as a whole. A management committee will be set up. After the reorganization of the merchant corps, training will be concentrated at six locations, including the city district, Huashi, Houtang, Qingyang, Yunting, and Shengang, starting on June 1.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing. Wangjiangjing Recruits Volunteer Police</h3>
<p>In Wangjiangjing town, Jiaxing, because the militia patrol team has been disbanded, it is necessary to recruit volunteer police. The recruitment method still requires selecting militiamen first, starting with training. Those who are 21-40 years old, have no vices, are physically strong, and can organize writing are qualified. The training period is set for three months, two hours a day. Yesterday, a meeting of the five-household joint guarantee was convened, and it was decided that the volunteer police in this district would form one squadron, divided into three district teams, each district team consisting of 36 people (it is stipulated that one district team for Wangjiangjing, one district team for Nanhui, and one district team for Chengxi), and recruitment will be conducted from the militiamen of each bao on a voluntary basis. If the number of volunteers is insufficient, it will be determined by drawing lots. The training start date is May 20, and the list of volunteer police must be sent to the town office by the 18th.</p>
<h3>Pinghu. Five Towns Hold Joint Lantern Parade</h3>
<p>The various agencies in this city have spared no effort in promoting the anti-smoking campaign. Students from various schools are giving lectures in the streets and alleys. Hu Jingming, the mayor of Yongfeng town in the city district, and others are planning to create various warning lanterns, such as opium ghosts and opium pipes, and hold a joint parade with the five towns in the city and the two villages near the city. The five towns and two villages have decided to hold a lantern festival on the evenings of the 17th and 18th. Merchants are also excited, and various ingenious lanterns have been added.</p>
<h3>Huzhou. Brothers Quarrel, Leading to Murder Case</h3>
<p>In Jinling Guild Hall , west of the city, Cai Ada, a 51-year-old resident, is a fisherman. His wife, Sui, has two sons, the eldest named Heshan, 26 years old, and the second son Along, 21 years old, both of whom are engaged in their father's profession. Ada's brother, A'er, because of the lack of children, made Along his adopted son. A'er married off Meizhen (currently 18 years old), the daughter of Long, who worked in Yingzhuyuan, as a child bride two years ago. Heshan, the eldest son of A'da, is naturally dissolute and does not do his job properly, and he likes to drink and commit violence, so he is looked down upon by his father. Therefore, Heshan works as a fish carrier in Jifang Port. However, because his income is not enough to cover his expenses, he often asks his younger brother to borrow money. If he is not satisfied, he will beat him. Heshan has great arm strength and knows martial arts, so Along often suffers. At about 2:00 p.m. on the 13th, Heshan came home drunk and again sought a quarrel with his younger brother, and wanted to stab Along with a sharp knife. Along, holding a knife in his hand, blocked it with a fishhook, knocked the knife to the ground, bent down and picked it up. Heshan, seeing the knife being picked up, stepped forward to grab it, causing Along to stab him several times, right in Heshan's throat. Blood flowed, and he fell dead on the ground. Afterwards, the Eighth Police Station detained Along and reported it to the court for inspection. At about 4:00 p.m., Prosecutor Weng of the Wuxing Court led the police to conduct an inspection and ordered a coffin to be prepared, and ordered the police to send Cai Along for interrogation.</p>

<h3>China Factory Association Cables for Strict Anti-Smuggling Measures to Uphold Sovereignty and Maintain Tax Revenue</h3>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association, concerned about the increasingly rampant smuggling in North China, has telegraphed the central government to strictly suppress smuggling in order to uphold sovereignty and maintain tax revenue. The original telegram reads: "To Premier Chiang of the Executive Yuan in Nanking, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Your Excellencies: Smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly rampant, spreading almost throughout the country. The sales of national goods are greatly affected, and national tax revenue is sharply reduced. At a time when the rural economy is increasingly collapsing and purchasing power is becoming even more meager, how can we withstand the squeezing of smuggled goods? As a group of domestic manufacturers, the association has the responsibility to guide and protect the production and sales of national goods. Seeing this situation, we can no longer remain silent. Therefore, we urgently telegraph you, humbly requesting that Your Yuan (Ministry) promptly devise effective methods, instruct all competent authorities to strictly suppress smuggling, maintain law and order, and protect sovereignty. We await your orders in respectful trepidation. Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhongying, Chen Jicheng, Zhu Gengtao, Xu Xiaochu, and other standing committee members of the China National Products Manufacturers Association respectfully submit this message. Respectfully."</p>
<h3>Smuggling Affects the Shipping Industry; Chinese and Foreign Shipping Companies Seek Solutions</h3>
<p>Smuggled goods have recently spread from North and South China to Shanghai. Chinese and foreign shipping companies in Shanghai have been greatly affected, with business plummeting. All shipping companies are anxiously seeking solutions and discussing how to salvage the situation. Even foreign shipping companies are urgently planning measures to compensate for the losses. The impact is indeed a major issue for Shanghai today. Mr. Stock, the General Manager of the Taikoo Company, has come to China from England to investigate the shipping industry in the North and South Seas and the Yangtze River, and he has already understood everything. At 4:00 PM today, he will host all customs brokers in Shanghai to connect and discuss countermeasures. Imports can be processed at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Antiquities Arrive Tomorrow Morning; Imports can be processed at 7:00 PM</h3>
<p>The Chinese antiquities transported to England for exhibition are being shipped back to Shanghai on the Great Britain Company's ship "Pula". Yesterday, the ship sent a telegram stating that it would be allowed to enter the port at 7:00 AM tomorrow morning, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf. There are a total of ninety-three boxes, of which eighty-four are medium-sized and nine are large, occupying a total of 1,840 feet, weighing 44.5 tons. A British warship escorted the cargo from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Antiquities Custody Office sent two people with a letter from Minister Kong to the Great Britain Company to discuss the procedures for retrieving the antiquities after the ship arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Consolidates 60 Million Public Bonds; Officially Issued Today; Old Bond Exchanges Require 55 Million; Remaining Amount of 840,000 Used as Collateral</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to repay old debts and consolidate old bonds, has been approved by the government to issue 60 million yuan in consolidation public bonds, divided into four types: A, B, C, and D. Type A is 4.5 million yuan, with a term of 14 years and an interest rate of 8%. Type B is 17 million yuan, with a term of 16 years and an interest rate of 7%. Type C is 10.5 million yuan, with a term of 18 years and an interest rate of 6%. Type D is 28 million yuan, with a term of 20 years and an interest rate of 6%. The original date for issuance was the 1st of this month, but it was postponed due to the lack of legislative procedures. On the 13th, the Financial Committee of the Legislative Yuan completed the review of the Public Bond Regulations and decided to start issuing them today. The proceeds will be used to exchange 55 million yuan of old public bonds, and the remaining 5 million yuan will be used for construction and to make up for insufficient government funding. Cheng Yuanfan, the director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, has negotiated with the Hangzhou branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to mortgage 1.4 million yuan of the new public bonds at a 60% discount for 840,000 yuan to meet immediate needs. Now that the public bonds have gone through the legislative process and are officially issued, the loan is expected to become a reality soon.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Monetary Agreement Established; Foreign Exchange Stabilized; Loans from the US and Lower Exchange Rates are Untrue; Chinese and Foreign Banking Circles Consider the Agreement Appropriate</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the purpose of the Sino-American Trade Agreement is to complete China's monetary policy and stabilize foreign exchange. Both Chinese and foreign banking circles consider the agreement to be appropriate. It is learned that Chen Guangfu, the general manager of the Shanghai Bank, Guo Bingwen, the director of the International Trade Bureau, and Gu Jigao, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, went to the United States to investigate the economy. After the Sino-American Monetary Agreement was established with American Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, a New Voice News Agency reporter inquired from banking circles yesterday morning and learned that the purpose of the agreement was to complete China's new currency system policy and stabilize foreign exchange. A portion of China's silver will be deposited in the United States, and the United States can be overdrawn in US dollars when necessary. China will no longer sell silver in the London market to prevent the price of silver from plummeting. Moreover, since the implementation of China's new currency system policy, silver has been concentrated. Exporting a portion of silver has no impact on the whole. Also, rumors that China and the United States have established a $25 million loan, etc., are incorrect. It is actually a misunderstanding that China can overdraw US dollars when necessary. As for rumors that the Chinese government will lower foreign exchange rates and devalue the legal currency, these are also untrue. According to the telegraphic transfer rates announced by the Central Bank today, London is 1 shilling 2.5 pence, New York is 30 US dollars, Paris is 454 francs, Berlin is 74 marks, and Japan is 103 yen, which are the same as the previously set standards, proving that China's foreign exchange remains stable. Shanghai's Chinese and foreign banking circles believe that the agreement is appropriate and a good way to complete China's currency system policy.</p>

<h3>Chairman Hu's Last Work; A "Huanxi Sha" Poem Sent to Friend Yi Dachang</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chairman Hu of the Central Executive Committee composed a "Huanxi Sha" poem on the morning of the 9th and sent it to his friend Yi Dachang.

The original poem is recorded below:</p>
<p>Huanxi Sha</p>
<p>Hearing that Layman Yi has new lyrics with the line "A hundred bitter words, the heart can no longer bear," so tragic, I casually resolve it with a commonplace tune:</p>
<p>A hundred bitter words, the heart bears alone,</p>
<p>Jue Weng's family has many wonders of its own.</p>
<p>Why does the world still doubt the seven treasures?</p>
<p>Regret less carving the Yangzi ode,</p>
<p>Gradually return to the plainness of Tuizhi's poems,</p>
<p>Only old friends know this feeling.</p>
<p>(Gradually or old) Unreservedly present this draft.</p>

<h3>Factory Inspection; No Agreement Yet; Talks Are Nearing Agreement</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told a reporter from the Mainland News yesterday (the 14th) that the Nanjing news report that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government had reached an agreement on factory inspection was completely unfounded. He and Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government are discussing this matter. Although the issue has been negotiated repeatedly for more than a year, it has not been successful. The key points of the organization and implementation of the inspection system remain to be resolved. When the reporter asked what the key differences of opinion were between the two parties, Mr. Fessenden declined to answer, only saying that after twelve months of talks, the final completion date was not far off, and we are now nearing agreement, but we have not yet reached this stage. The reporter from the Mainland News also learned that the final draft of the agreement has not yet been drawn up, so it cannot be submitted to the Municipal Council for review and decision at this time. Regarding the Nanjing news report that the date for inspecting factories in the concession will be July 1, Mr. Fessenden said that if the current negotiations can be concluded satisfactorily in time, then everything can proceed by July 1. Mr. Fessenden still met with Secretary-General Yu on Wednesday to discuss the inspection issue.</p>

<h3>Expanding the National Salvation Through Aviation Movement: Mayor Wu Broadcasted a Speech Yesterday on the Aviation Movement and National Revival</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, for the sake of Shanghai's expanded aviation-based national salvation movement, at 5 PM on the 15th, broadcasted a speech on the city radio station, titled "The Aviation Movement and National Revival." His speech was as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, the China Aviation Association, this year, in order to expand the national salvation through aviation movement and raise funds to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a commemoration of Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday, has specially entrusted Tiecheng to conduct an expanded fundraising movement among the city's 3.5 million citizens for the purchase of aircraft. Since the citizens of Shanghai initiated the national salvation through aviation movement, a surge arose in various places, enthusiastically donating and purchasing aircraft to assist the government, yielding significant results. This movement is further imbued with a new significance of supporting the leader. Our citizens, in particular, should uphold their past enthusiasm and rise up to support it, so that this movement may have a greater influence and greater success.</p>
<p>The world today, due to the development of science and culture, is progressing rapidly in everything. Even in terms of national defense and military affairs, the progress in recent years is deeply astounding. Former military strategists regarded the coastline as the first line of defense; since the development of the air force, naval defense has lost its effectiveness. Former military strategists all considered tanks as the sharpest weapon in warfare; since the development of the air force, its destructive power and combat strength are even far beyond those of tanks. Therefore, the famous French general Foch once said, "In the Second World War, the most active and powerful force will be airplanes. The battle formation of the future will inevitably consist of large-scale squadrons of aircraft roaming the skies, and their destructive capabilities will far surpass those of the army and navy, able to demoralize the enemy and disarm them. The air force of the future will be the main driving force behind victory or defeat in war."</p>
<p>Since the European War, the national defense construction of all countries has centered on the air force. The equipment of the air forces of various countries has made astonishing progress, especially France, with over 40,000 air force personnel and over 3,000 standing military aircraft, all of which are sophisticated weapons. After the completion of the Russian Five-Year Plan, national defense construction has also made astonishing progress, with 2,800 standing military aircraft, exceeding any other country. The United States follows with 2,600 aircraft, Italy has 1,800 aircraft, all of the latest models, and Britain has over 1,400 aircraft, but its production rate is very high, capable of expanding by one or two times in the shortest time. Japan has about 1,200 aircraft, and particularly emphasizes civil aviation. Germany has 1,100 aircraft. The above figures refer only to standing military aircraft. If civilian aircraft are included, the number would be even more astonishing. Following them, countries such as Yugoslavia and Romania have about 600-700 aircraft, Poland and Czechoslovakia have about 500-600 aircraft, and Switzerland and Belgium also have over 400 aircraft.</p>
<p>In light of this and deeply concerned about the emptiness of our national defense construction, Tiecheng held a publicity campaign for the national salvation through aviation movement in Shanghai two years ago, and emphasized that air force construction is the most economical, most effective, and most progressive national defense plan, and the most suitable for China, which is lagging in national defense. He vociferously advocated:</p>
<p>We must concentrate the nation's intelligence to build the air force, and we must concentrate the nation's financial resources to develop the air force.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, thanks to the support of people from all walks of life in Shanghai, we have been able to achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>Now, the world situation is increasingly urgent, and the national crisis is pressing. Not only should our work continue to develop, but it is also necessary to accelerate our efforts. This year is Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. All parts of the country are raising funds to purchase aircraft to present to the government as a commemoration of Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday. This expression has two profound and significant meanings: one is to strengthen national defense, and the other is to support the leader.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of this matter, this city has specially launched an expanded aviation-based national salvation movement since May. We hope that citizens from all walks of life will recognize the important significance of this initiative, do their best to contribute as much as possible, and enthusiastically donate to strengthen our national defense, enhance the strength of the nation, overcome the current national crisis, and glorify the nation's life. May 15, Year 25.</p>
<h3>Central, Communications, and Other Banks Offer Opinions on the Organization of the Agricultural Credit Bureau; Division of Labor and Cooperation: The Government Establishes the Agricultural Credit Bureau, and Banks Organize Agricultural Loan Groups, Each Responsible for Its Own Tasks, So That the Boundaries Between Administration and the Business World Are Clearly Defined</h3>
<p>Industry Minister Wu Dingchang twice convened financial circles to discuss the establishment of the Agricultural Credit Bureau, passing an organizational outline that stipulates a fixed joint investment of 30 million yuan, shared equally by the government and participating banks. The amount of circulating funds is not fixed and will be determined at the beginning of each year in consultation with participating banks. The establishment is set for July 1. Banking circles in this city generally agree with the principles but have offered many opinions on the organizational system, which have been submitted by the Bankers' Association to the ministry for review. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency investigated the details from various banks as follows:</p>
<p>Opinions from the Central, Communications, and Bank of China</p>
<p>Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank; Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China; and Hu Jun, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Guangneng Bank, jointly issued an opinion on the organization of the Agricultural Credit Bureau, stating: "Our country is founded on agriculture, as history has long shown. In recent years, the rural economy has been declining. Our government is deeply concerned about this and has established the Agricultural Credit Bureau to seek relief, which is truly a crucial plan for today. The Minister of Industry, in drafting the general outline of the Agricultural Credit Bureau's measures, widely consulted and solicited opinions, and its contents are detailed and precise. All Chinese people are optimistic about its success. However, the following points must be carefully considered: 1. The outline divides the Agricultural Credit Bureau's funds into three categories: fixed funds, joint investment funds, and circulating funds. Fixed funds should be official allocations, joint investment funds seem to be commercial shares, and circulating funds are bank loans. Its nature seems to be a joint public-private venture, but in reality, it is not a company organization. This is the first unclear aspect. 2. The outline states that the mission of the Agricultural Credit Bureau is to circulate agricultural funds and adjust agricultural products. However, circulating agricultural funds is the work of financial institutions, while adjusting agricultural products is an administrative measure of the government for agriculture. The two should be divided and not combined, and should cooperate and not compete separately. If they are combined into one, the Agricultural Credit Bureau would be both an administrative agency to support agriculture and a financial institution to manage loans. This is organizational confusion. 3. The outline states that the Agricultural Credit Bureau can operate loans in rural areas, making the Agricultural Credit Bureau a creditor to the farmers. At the same time, the joint investment funds of the banks, although loaned to farmers, make the Agricultural Credit Bureau a debtor to the banks. Combining the rights of a creditor and the obligations of a debtor is questionable for a government-established agricultural administrative agency and should be studied further. In our humble opinion, to avoid these shortcomings, we should divide labor and cooperate. The government should establish the Agricultural Credit Bureau, and the banks should organize agricultural loan groups, each responsible for its own tasks and complementing each other. Although the methods are different, they will ultimately achieve the same goal. We have drafted a general outline of the organization and responsibilities of the two institutions and list them below for reference. (A) Agricultural Credit Bureau, (I) Organization: 1. The Agricultural Credit Bureau shall be established by the Ministry of Industry. 2. The funds of the Agricultural Credit Bureau shall be set at 30 million national currency, which the government shall allocate 6 million yuan at the beginning of each fiscal year, starting from the 25th year, to be fully allocated in five years. 3. The Agricultural Credit Bureau shall be established in Nanjing and may establish branches in agricultural areas. Local officials may be appointed in each county. 4. The Agricultural Credit Bureau shall have one director and one deputy director (or president and vice president). 5. The Agricultural Credit Bureau shall have a supervisory committee, consisting of five members. In addition to the director and deputy director (or president and vice president), who shall be appointed by the government as ex officio members, the other three members shall be recommended by the agricultural loan group and submitted to the government for appointment. Their term of office shall be determined separately. (II) Responsibilities: The responsibilities of the Agricultural Credit Bureau are as follows: Planting Season: (1) Selection of seeds, (2) Matching of soil fertility, (3) Eradication of pests, (4) Improvement of agricultural tools, (5) Planting season. All agricultural facilities to be carried out shall be assisted, guided, and promoted by the Agricultural Credit Bureau. Harvest Season: (1) Collection of agricultural products, (2) Establishment of warehouses, (3) Facilitation of transportation, (4) Promotion of sales, (5) Classification of varieties, (6) All scheduling matters during and after the harvest season. For agricultural products harvested, the funds needed during the storage, transportation, and sales periods shall be provided by the agricultural loan group upon the introduction and guarantee of the Agricultural Credit Bureau. The use of the Agricultural Credit Bureau's funds shall be based on the principle of constructing warehouses, subsidizing agricultural banks, cooperatives, or farmers' pawnshops, in addition to adjusting all matters during the planting season, and shall be used to guarantee the principal and interest of the agricultural loan group's joint investment funds. (B) Agricultural Loan Group, (I) Organization: 1. The agricultural loan group shall be organized by banks participating in agricultural loans. 2. Any bank or financial institution whose main task is to assist agriculture, or any bank or financial institution that handles savings, may participate in the agricultural loan group. 3. The loan funds of the agricultural loan group shall be tentatively set at 6 million yuan in the first year and shall be gradually increased according to business needs thereafter. 4. Each participating bank or financial institution shall send one representative to recommend three members of the supervisory committee of the Agricultural Credit Bureau for government appointment. 5. The agricultural loan group shall have a council, consisting of five members elected by the representatives, and the council members shall elect one chairman and one vice-chairman to preside over the affairs of the group. 6. The agricultural loan group may establish branches in agricultural areas and may station commissioners in each county. 7. The organization of the agricultural loan group shall be submitted to the government for record. (II) Responsibilities: 1. Loans arising from agricultural production shall be granted upon the introduction of the Agricultural Credit Bureau and the guarantee of the council. 2. Branch loans may be handled expediently within the limits approved by the council, but shall still be submitted for record. 3. The three supervisory committee members of the Agricultural Credit Bureau recommended by the group shall provide opinions on the loans introduced by the Agricultural Credit Bureau. 4. According to the component to be borrowed, the joint loans shall be granted and the loans shall be collected and repaid to each bank in proportion according to the original schedule. Based on the above, the two major tasks of circulating agricultural funds and adjusting agricultural products shall be handled separately by the Agricultural Credit Bureau and the agricultural loan group, while still maintaining close contact. The agricultural loan group, having obtained a firm guarantee, can grant loans as much as possible, and agricultural affairs, mediated by the Agricultural Credit Bureau, will not suffer from a shortage of funds. After agricultural credit is increased, not only can the rural economy be expected to recover, but also urban finance will rely on it for flexibility."</p>
<p>New China Bank Contributes Opinions</p>
<p>Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the New China Bank, contributed opinions on the Agricultural Credit Bureau, saying, "The establishment of the Agricultural Credit Bureau is a matter of urgent importance. This bank comprehensively designs and plans for the two major tasks of providing agricultural capital and distributing agricultural products, which can easily achieve the effect of communication in the implementation of a consistent policy and has great foresight. The following points are particularly brilliant: 1. The phenomenon of scattered conflicts can be reduced. 2. The difficulties of commercial banks, savings banks, and agricultural goods can be reduced. 3. A comprehensive plan can be made for agricultural finance and agricultural warehouses. 4. Agricultural policies can be promoted by this. The implementation of agricultural policies requires both the use of political power to achieve success and the reliance on financial power to achieve success. Since the Agricultural Credit Bureau is both the organ for providing agricultural capital nationwide and the hub for the distribution of agricultural products nationwide, concentrating efforts to promote agricultural policies will easily achieve twice the result with half the effort. However, it seems that there are several points that need to be studied before starting the establishment, namely: 1. The entire system of agricultural finance should be considered. Since the Agricultural Credit Bureau is one of the agricultural financial institutions, its position in the agricultural financial system should also be noted. The agricultural loan institutions in our country are gradually becoming complex, and there should be a whole system to add a standard. The main purpose of establishing the Agricultural Credit Bureau is to be an agricultural financial management agency or a business combination. If it is a business combination, whether it will be reorganized into a central agricultural chattel bank when the agricultural financial production system is completed, or even become the general hub of the entire agricultural finance, should be considered at the time of establishment. 2. We hope that the organizational aspects will be given careful consideration. Regarding the organization of the Agricultural Credit Bureau, there are two points that should be re-studied: (A) The relationship between the agricultural capital department and the agricultural production department should have corresponding regulations. Reading the outline, the agricultural capital department is biased towards finance, while the agricultural production department aims at management and sales, so it is similar to the trust department of the Agricultural Credit Bureau. In other words, the agricultural capital department is the source of agricultural capital injected into the country, and the agricultural production department is the hub for controlling the transportation and sales of agricultural products nationwide and balancing agricultural prices. If so, division of labor and cooperation, in order to revitalize agriculture and rural renewal, is the most perfect method. However, the two departments should have corresponding divisions and regulations in terms of capital and accounting. If so, then under the premise of mutual assistance, each can establish its own business plan and exercise its internal functions, so that abuses can be avoided and the benefits can be fully realized. (B) The nature of the Agricultural Credit Bureau should be clearly defined. This outline has explained that the Agricultural Credit Bureau is a public-private cooperation organization, but it has not clearly stated whether the Agricultural Credit Bureau is a machine for managing agricultural loans, an organization of joint banks, an enterprise, or for public welfare. This actually needs to be determined. Also, if the Agricultural Credit Bureau is a kind of enterprise, it is an organization of commercial banks, setting up branches in provinces and appointing commissioners in counties. This kind of name with administrative implications should be avoided as much as possible, so as not to cause conceptual confusion. 3. Attention should be paid to the objects, methods, and steps of loans. The loan resources of the Agricultural Credit Bureau are divided into two types: fixed funds and circulating funds. The former is raised by the government and the latter is borrowed by public and private banks. The loan of circulating funds is mainly based on agricultural product mortgages. This method is quite practical, because the Agricultural Credit Bureau hopes that commercial banks will participate in the investment, so from the nature of commercial banks, its loans should also be based on agricultural product mortgages. Therefore, it is best to strictly stipulate that agricultural product mortgages should be used exclusively for circulating funds, while other loans, such as those for improving agricultural products, should be handled by fixed funds. This is what is meant by the object of the loan. The so-called loan method refers to direct or indirect loans. According to this outline, the loans of the Agricultural Credit Bureau's agricultural capital department are aimed at not making direct loans except with special permission. The advantages and disadvantages of this should be further explored. According to indirect loans, there are two advantages: (A) the organization is simple, and (B) the loan has more guarantees. However, if there is no sound organization in the provinces, counties, and rural areas, and there is no power to supervise and direct them, then in addition to mortgage loans, it is difficult to achieve the safety of the Agricultural Credit Bureau's loans and the ideal goals. Therefore, indirect loans should have careful consideration for the lower-level organization and supervision and direction. As for the loan steps, that is, the loan procedures for long-term, medium-term, and short-term. At present, what is most needed in the agricultural field in our country is operating funds below the medium term. This outline also seems to focus on medium-term chattel credit, and chattel-to-person credit is secondary. In other words, the main object of loans is chattel, and land mortgage credit, etc., are not taken into account. This is also an appropriate arrangement, because the source of funds for the Agricultural Credit Bureau, in addition to the fixed and longer-term nature of government allocation, is mostly suitable for medium-term agricultural chattel credit for other public and private banks. And the long-term funds allocated by the government are also limited, so it is better to focus on one kind of credit to concentrate efforts, rather than considering both long, medium, and short terms, so that the business is not refined. Therefore, when the Agricultural Credit Bureau cannot take care of long, medium, and short terms in fact, it is best to only work hard on the most urgent chattel mortgage loans. Other long-term mortgage loans should be handled by special institutions, and the farmer banks or cooperatives should be responsible for the unsecured credit loans themselves. The Agricultural Credit Bureau may obtain contact with them to achieve the effect of communication and harmony. 4. The method of private banks participating should be simple and safe. The Agricultural Credit Bureau's enthusiasm for commercial banks to participate in the investment can be seen in the government's guarantee of principal and interest, because commercial banks are not public welfare institutions and should find ways to protect the safety of their investment. The government's guarantee of principal and interest aims to encourage the current scattered agricultural loan situation to develop into an organized institution, so that scattered funds are gathered into a whole resource, and unplanned investments become planned loans. Therefore, this method not only takes into account the difficulties of commercial banks, but also makes agricultural loan control easier to carry out. However, in addition to the government's guarantee of principal and interest, it is best to further seek simplicity and safety for private banks' participation in capital contributions. This outline has a provision for issuing agricultural bonds, which is also a way to absorb funds, but it seems that it is not easy to hold temporarily. According to the current situation, the high profit of valuable securities does not meet the conditions for providing low-interest agricultural funds. Therefore, in order to participate in the investment of private banks, it is best to use warehouse securities, agricultural bills, and other methods to seek the flexibility of capital turnover. If so, the investment of private banks is easier and the resources of agricultural finance can be smooth. On this point, it seems that there is also a need for a concrete plan."</p>
<p>Zhejiang Xingnong and Industrial Opinions</p>
<p>A. Opinions of Zhejiang Industrial Bank on the General Outline of the Agricultural Credit Bureau: 1. The joint lending funds of each bank are stipulated at 8% weekly interest, which is a loss for commercial banks in terms of cost. It is proposed to appropriately increase it. 2. The joint lending funds of each bank have no recovery period, which is inconsistent with the nature of the loan. It should be stipulated that the longest period should not exceed a certain period, or the bank should be allowed to recover from the Agricultural Credit Bureau when needed. 3. Since the joint investment capital and circulating funds are supplied by the bank and guaranteed by the government, it is better for the Agricultural Credit Bureau to issue agricultural bonds and hand them over to the banks for underwriting, canceling the joint investment capital and circulating funds, which is simpler. The above two points, please discuss them in the case of the Taiwan convergence case. B. Opinions of the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank on the General Outline of the Agricultural Credit Bureau: The establishment of the Agricultural Credit Bureau is to circulate agricultural funds, adjust agricultural products, and support the development of local farmers' banks, which is consistent with the purpose of our bank's business, and we strongly agree with the principles and will participate as appropriate. However, the second clause in the outline, clause B, stipulates that the joint investment fund of 30 million should be paid in five years, while the business term of the Agricultural Credit Bureau is not specified, and it seems that it should be specified with reference to the business term of each bank in order to be complete. How should it be handled? Please also discuss it in the consolidated case.</p>
<p>Banks in This City Eager to Participate</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the New News Agency, all the banks in this city have expressed their agreement with the organization of the Agricultural Credit Bureau and are eager to participate. The banks that have already agreed to participate include the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Donglai, Bank of China, Gold City, Zhongfu, Shanghai, Soviet Farmers, China Industrial, Communications, Continent, China Exchange, China Farmers, New China, China Agricultural and Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Agricultural and Commercial, and 25 other banks. Other banks, such as Overseas Chinese, are consulting with their head offices or are preparing to participate. It is expected that many banks will continue to participate before the official establishment of the Agricultural Credit Bureau on July 1.</p>
<h3>Three Major Special Trade Unions Request Clear Stipulations on the Number of Occupational Representatives by Telegram</h3>
<p>The representative office of the China Seamen's Union telegraphed: "To all newspaper offices: We have recently sent a telegram to the Central Executive Committee (Department of Mass Training) of the Nanjing Kuomintang, which reads, 'We recently received a telegram from the special party headquarters of the Pinghan Railway, which stated that the election law for national assembly representatives passed by the Legislative Yuan, in the appendix, the special trade union representatives for railways, seamen, posts and telecommunications are missing, which is very worried. In addition to requesting the central government to increase the number of representatives to be distributed to the special trade unions of railways, seamen, posts and telecommunications, we also hope that the Gui Zeng will unanimously advocate and urge the central government to adopt and implement it, so as to show fairness and follow public opinion. The previous cases reported by this association on the issue that various seamen's representatives have repeatedly requested have been reported to your meeting (department). Our Haichang Railway, Posts and Telecommunications Special Trade Unions all have a glorious history, sound organization, a wide scope, a large number of people, and are a whole organization directly under the central government, and it is inconvenient to participate in the occupational elections of each province and city separately. The members spread all over the country, and seamen are even more mobile, making it difficult to participate in the occupational elections of a certain province or city. Furthermore, Gui Zeng (the Central Government) originally had a principle for the election law for these representatives: 'An occupational group takes the group as a unit regardless of region', but the election law for these representatives that has now been passed by the Legislative Yuan lists the trade unions in provinces and cities, and does not stipulate a word on how our three major special trade unions, which have an indivisible nature, should participate in the election, which seems to be inconsistent with the principles set by your meeting (the Central Government). The matter concerns the participation of professional workers in the regime, and the public cannot stop it. The reasons for the telegram are that, in addition to sending a separate telegram, we will submit a second telegram to your meeting (department) for review. We urge you to revise the election law as soon as possible to comply with public opinion, and please clearly stipulate the number of occupational representatives for our three major special trade unions of seamen, railways, posts and telecommunications, so as to comfort the hopes of our millions of transportation workers. Yang Hu, the special envoy of the China Haichang Trade Union, bows in the cold.'" The matter concerns the political power of the majority of occupational workers and should not be easily overlooked, which violates the Central Government's principle of valuing occupational groups. In addition to submitting a request and sending a separate telegram, we also hope that your newspaper will unanimously advocate and urge the Central Government to approve the revision to comply with public opinion and show fairness. We look forward to it. The Representative Office of the China Seamen's Union, in the cold.</p>

<h3>Gu Xinyi Goes to Beijing to Request, Already Ordered Crushed Rice to be Granted Special Consideration by Analogy, Because the Purpose is to Relieve the Poor's Food Needs</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Trade Association, went to Beijing last night to petition the Ministry of Finance after the Ministry of Finance implemented a full tax on imported crushed rice starting on April 11th.  In addition to petitioning the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other relevant departments to continue levying half tax on the already ordered crushed rice, Mr. Gu petitioned the Ministry of Finance in Beijing last night.  Because the Shanghai Grain Commission believed, based on statistics, that the supply and demand were insufficient and had petitioned the municipal government for 200,000 yuan to purchase 100,000 bags of foreign rice due to talk of a famine, the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association independently purchased crushed rice because the municipal treasury was stretched thin.  The purpose was to meet the food needs of the poor, similar to the situation of purchasing crushed rice in Ningbo, so he requested special consideration by analogy.</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Will Petition the National Government to Commend the Chinese and Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief General Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief General Association, located at 505 Henan Road, this city, is the pioneer of rural cooperative enterprises in the country. According to statistics, the cooperative societies it has established now number more than 10,000 across the country, and their achievements are very good. It was previously entrusted by the National Government's Flood Relief Committee to handle agricultural relief in the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei. After the conclusion, it organized rural cooperative societies in each of these provinces. Later, with the establishment of the Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Economic Commission, it sent a letter to the committee requesting it to take back the independently operated projects. Members were dispatched in March of this year to take over the projects separately. It has been previously reported. It is now heard that Chen Gongbo, chairman of the Cooperative Committee, believes that the Relief and Disaster Relief Association's handling of cooperation in the four provinces was a difficult and constructive effort, and the benefits to farmers were substantial, so its contributions cannot be ignored. He plans to send a letter to the National Economic Commission to petition the National Government to give it special commendation. A special letter was sent to the Relief and Disaster Relief Association a few days ago, first expressing thanks and admiration. A copy of the original letter is as follows: Respectfully, This committee has taken over the agricultural loan affairs of the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, and your association has transferred them for handling. The investigation shows that your association's handling of agricultural loans in the four provinces was entrusted by the former National Government Flood Relief Committee. Later, after the Flood Relief Committee ended, it was transferred to the National Economic Commission for management. Counting the time, it has been nearly five years. Assessing the funds, a huge amount has been raised. As of January, a total of 2,774 mutual aid societies and 6,382 cooperative societies have been established in the four provinces, with a total of 334,958 members. I believe that such a huge undertaking is truly a difficult and constructive effort, and tens of thousands of farmers are secretly benefiting from it, which is of great significance. What is particularly commendable is that your association independently raised 150,000 yuan in operating expenses at the beginning of the establishment of agricultural loans in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces. Its righteous actions and benevolent spirit are admirable. Now, with your permission, the cooperation in the four provinces has been completely transferred. Examining the accounts and investigating the achievements, the results are obvious and can serve as a model. In addition to sending a letter to the National Economic Commission to petition the National Government for special commendation, I would like to express my gratitude in advance with this special letter. I hope you will take note of it. Sincerely, To the Chinese and Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief General Association.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits Another Petition to the Ministry of Finance, Requesting to Maintain the Silver Content of Silverware</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce submitted another petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting to maintain the silver content used in the silver ornament and silverware manufacturing industry. The petition is for the matter of petitioning. The Silverware Trade Association stated in a letter dated the 14th of this month that our silverware industry has a long history of creating and inventing utensils. Workers engaged in silverware manufacturing are found throughout the country. Taking Shanghai as an example, more than 100,000 silversmiths and silver workers rely on it to support their families. It is one of the few handicraft industries in our country, which is truly of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Silver Product Silver Usage Management Regulations last year, limiting the use of chemical silver to make utensils, with the necessary addition of 30% silver, the market has been shaken, and customers have lost their trust, resulting in a gradual decrease in our industry's work and an increasing difficulty in maintaining livelihoods. The reason why the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Silver Product Silver Usage Management Regulations is nothing more than to prevent unscrupulous merchants from selling silver products for profit. However, the selling price of our industry's silver products is a combination of the value of silver and labor costs. In addition to calculating the amount of silver according to the market price, the labor cost is determined by the complexity of the manufacturing patterns. For ordinary patterned utensils, the selling price includes a ratio of two parts silver value to one part labor cost. For those with more complex patterns, the labor cost is often more than two-fifths of the selling price. Even if there are unscrupulous merchants selling silver, they must sacrifice too much and turn a blind eye. This is known to all who are familiar with the industry. Now, the Ministry of Finance's limitation on the use of chemical silver to make utensils is truly impossible for our handicraft industry to achieve. Chemical silver is made by melting various metals together, and machine manufacturing is still possible. If handmade, it will break upon hammering and will be dark in color, unable to gain the love of the public. As for adding 30% silver, although the association has repeatedly tested it, it is too hard to form utensils. If we want to equip ourselves with machinery, the ability of each workshop is limited. Moreover, in the current state of economic downturn, the current situation is already unsustainable, so where would there be surplus funds to purchase machinery? And the training of labor is not something that can be achieved in a short period of time. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Silver Product Silver Usage Management Regulations last year, the silversmiths and silver workers in our city have been like prisoners sentenced to death, and the public is in a state of panic, unable to live in peace. Now, the deadline for using silver is approaching again, and the only remaining silver product handicraft industry in the country will soon be on the verge of extinction. The public's petition is afraid of violating government orders, so Yuan Xingzhi, Yu Ruichun, Yuan Guoxiang, Sun Bingchu, and other thirteen people were specially elected as representatives to appeal to your association to uphold the purpose of maintaining the city's commerce and to pity the livelihoods of tens of thousands of silversmiths and silver workers, and to request the Ministry of Finance to amend the Silver Product Silver Usage Management Regulations to maintain the original silver content used in order to maintain the national industry and the lives of the people. Before the Ministry of Finance revises the regulations, please allow your association to forward the petition to the Ministry of Finance to continue manufacturing utensils as before, so that the livelihoods of silversmiths and silver workers in the city will not be interrupted, etc., have been sent to the association. The investigation shows that the case of maintaining the original silver content in the manufacture of silver ornaments and silverware was previously petitioned by the association based on the request of the Silverware Trade Association and repeatedly submitted to your department, but it was rejected. Now, the Silverware Trade Association has made this request again. I believe that the point of discussion in this case is that chemical silver cannot withstand hammering and is dark in color, and adding 30% silver is too hard to form utensils. This point is firmly held by the industry and does not match what your department has indicated. Although the association does not dare to say that the industry's request is without subjective prejudices, it is ultimately based on actual testing and is not mere conjecture. If we only use theoretical words to prevent its forwarding, it will not only fail to convince the industry, but also the serious unemployment problem will be impossible to solve. It is proposed that your department select personnel to select several types of chemical silver in Shanghai, as well as 30% alloyed silver, and order the industry's workers to try to manufacture them one by one, with close supervision by the personnel sent by your department. If the test results are indeed as the industry has repeatedly stated, that it cannot be manufactured without machinery, then it can be considered that it should be granted the industry's request for a change to allow them to preserve their inherited profession, and silverware is scattered among the people. As in the example of Italy today, it can also be used for the country in times of need. Otherwise, if the results of the supervision are not as the industry claims, then your department should refute it based on the facts, and the industry will naturally submit without saying a word. If there are any more requests, the association will certainly not forward them. It is reasonable to submit this petition to your department for review and approval, and it is in the public interest to implement it.</p>

<h3>Domestic Paint and Sundry Goods Industry, Letter to the National Chamber of Commerce to Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Paint and Sundry Goods Trade Association, for the benefit of its members and colleagues at Yanliao Zahuohang, recently appointed China Merchant East Asia Paint Factory's domestic Lide Powder as its general manager. Now, the company has sent a letter requesting promotion and will forward the letter to the National Chamber of Commerce Federation for wide promotion. The original letter is recorded below: "To the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, I am writing to inform you that our member, Tongrenhehang, has informed us that Huashang Dongya Factory's product, Jiji brand Lide powder (English translation, Lithopone), commonly known as foreign lead powder, is available in four types: 12 degrees, 15 degrees, 22 degrees, and 30 degrees, as well as 40 degrees and 50 degrees. If various factories and companies need it, they can order it. This material is made entirely from domestic products and is of excellent quality, surpassing imported goods. It is an essential item for industrial raw materials. Rubber, coated cloth, ink, paint, coatings, and other factories and companies in China need this product. Other paints, lacquers, and various metals are also sold by our company. Recently, our company has become the general manager. However, this domestic product was taken from imported goods before its invention, and the rights and interests flowed out of the country. Now that the Chinese have invented this raw material and established factories, and the quality and ingredients are superior to imported goods, we should actively promote it to save the leaks. We are afraid that major factories and companies in various provinces and cities in China may not know about it, so we specially send a letter requesting your association to find a way to promote it and request that you forward a letter to the National Chamber of Commerce Federation and send letters to chambers of commerce in various places and transfer them to various industrial trade associations under their jurisdiction and various factories and companies to introduce them and use them in large quantities. We are sending four copies of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Laboratory's test report, a certificate of proof, and a copy of the approved Taichi trademark for proof, etc. Based on this, since the above-mentioned Lide powder is purely domestic and an important industrial raw material, it should be promoted as much as possible. Not only can it block leaks, but it may also be promoted abroad in the future. Only by uniting the people of the country and working together can we achieve success. Your association is the leader of the national business community, and the whole country admires it. A call to action will shake the country. We dare to ask you to give us your promotion and ask you to forward the letter to chambers of commerce in various provinces, counties, and cities and transfer it to various industrial trade associations, various factories, and companies under their jurisdiction to purchase and use domestic Lide powder as much as possible. The national economy and the people's livelihood are deeply dependent on it. Please quickly handle it and reply, we will be grateful." etc. If you need to know more about the use of domestic Lide powder, or need samples, or are willing to be a foreign distributor, please write directly to Tongrenhe Paint and Sundry Goods Co., Ltd., 80 Republic Road, French Concession, Shanghai to contact.</p>
<h3>Parents Ill and Lacking Care, Girl Falls from Upstairs and Dies</h3>
<p>Chen Yuxian, a resident of 305 Chezhan Road, Nanshi, from Shaoxing, 40 years old, is a small vendor who has been ill at home for several months. His wife, Zhang, 45 years old, has a son and a daughter and is currently two months pregnant and also ill. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by relatives and friends. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 PM the night before, his five-year-old daughter, named Aifen, was playing on the stairs without anyone taking care of her. She accidentally fell and was seriously injured. She was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but she died at 1:00 PM yesterday due to her injuries. Afterwards, the Chezhan Road Police Station went to investigate and summoned Chen for a brief interrogation. Because the girl fell and died on her own, she was released on bail to return home for arrangements.</p>
<h3>Appeal Judgment for Zhu Pingou, Clerk of the Public Security Bureau: Changed to a Fine of Two Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhu Pingou, a clerk of the First Section of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, was previously accused by a woman, Qian Gu, of defrauding her of 830 yuan in foreign currency under the guise of hiring a lawyer. The Public Security Bureau transferred Zhu to the court, which sentenced him to six months of imprisonment and ordered him to return the 830 yuan of the private lawsuit. Zhu, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to appeal to the second instance court. After careful review, the court declared that the portion of the original judgment regarding the crime and sentence was revoked, and Zhu Pingou was fined 200 yuan. Furthermore, the portion of the original judgment regarding the incidental civil lawsuit was revoked, and Qian Gu's lawsuit was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Provincial Government Orders Strict Prohibition of Privately Made Bamboo Tokens as Currency: Disrupting Finance and Undermining the Monetary System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an instruction from the Provincial Government to strictly prohibit stores in townships from privately making bamboo tokens to replace coins. The original order stated: "According to a petition from citizen Zhu Li, stores in remote townships often suffer from a shortage of capital and lack of liquidity. They privately make bamboo tokens measuring just over three inches, branding the store's name on one side and the equivalent value in coins on the other. Initially, these tokens were only used for temporary acceptance of goods and were exchanged for cash on the same evening. However, as their usage continued, they gradually began to circulate like national currency, being issued continuously. They are neither reported to the government nor supervised by banks' guarantees. In the event of an accident, the townspeople would suffer greatly. Local authorities, for the most part, turn a blind eye to this disruption of finance and do not prohibit it, which is tantamount to allowing their issuance. At a time when the countryside is declining, ignorant people are suffering from this poison. The private creation of tokens disrupts finance, undermines the monetary system, and the tokens even use the words 'several coins,' which constitutes fraud. The law has punishments for this and it cannot be allowed to continue, harming the townspeople. It is requested that an order be issued to all counties to uniformly investigate and prohibit this practice to benefit the townspeople." Based on this, the investigation reveals that the private creation of bamboo tokens for currency is indeed a disruption of finance and undermining of the monetary system. This should be strictly prohibited in order to respect the monetary policy.</p>

<h3>Sino-American-Japanese Cooperation to Establish a Jointly Operated Match Production and Sales Company</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Approves a Five-Year Ban on New Factories and Sets Annual Production and Sales Quotas for Each Existing Factory</p>
<p>The China National Match Industry Association, in order to save the match industry, is uniting Chinese and foreign match factories nationwide to establish the China National Match Production and Sales Company. This has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and preparations are underway. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Establishing a Jointly Operated Company: Although matches are a light industry, they are essential for daily life. Due to the impact of economic recession and weak purchasing power, the business of each factory has declined dramatically, with inventories piling up. They have been forced to compete by lowering prices, and as a result, each factory is on the verge of being unable to survive. In order to save the situation, the China National Match Industry Association has decided to establish the China National Match Production and Sales Company. The capital is set at 5 million national currency. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has approved a five-year trial period. During the trial period, no new factories will be allowed to be established in any region.</p>
<p>Number of Factories Nationwide: Match factories have been established in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces. At its peak, there were 202 factories, distributed across 22 provinces. Later, due to the impact of foreign goods dumping, the factories were unable to survive and gradually shut down. As of now, according to the report from the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, there are approximately 70 Chinese-owned match factories, one American-owned, and eight Japanese-owned. The Jiangsu region has the largest number, with 14 including the Great China Company.</p>
<p>Sino-Foreign Cooperation: Leaders of the National Match Industry Association, such as Liu Hongsheng, have reached agreements with the American Match Company and various Japanese factories. All, in order to survive, will join the match production and sales company in cooperation. Active preparations are currently underway, and it is expected to be established in the shortest possible time. The preparation office is located in the National Match Association on Sichuan Road, and Xu Zhiyi and others are responsible for handling the matter. Various rules and regulations have already been drafted.</p>
<p>Joint Operation Method: The joint operation company will determine the annual sales quotas and numbers for each participating match factory based on its sales volume and numbers. The capital will be determined proportionally. All matches produced by the factories will be sold by the joint operation company. The company's accounting will be transparent and supervised by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. There will be no monopolistic practices. The company will send personnel to supervise the products of each factory and simultaneously assess the prices of each factory's match brands. Prices cannot be arbitrarily raised or lowered.</p>
<p>Preventing Smuggling: Recently, smuggling in North China has been rampant, and China's industry and commerce have been affected. The match industry is no exception. The joint operation company has decided with foreign match manufacturers that after the company is established, the foreign match factories will assist in preventing match smuggling. Japanese and American match factories have expressed their agreement, as legitimate merchants in Japan and the United States are also affected by smuggling in North China.</p>
<h3>Famous Dancer Li Li's Divorce Lawsuit Adjourned</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Two Dancers and a Maid Testified; Closing Arguments Made, Judgment Set for the 20th</p>
<p>Li Li, formerly a dancer at the Metropolitan Dance Hall, the "Shanghai Dance Queen" and "Beiping Li Li," is currently 23 years old and resides at No. 19, Lane 799, Haig Road. In 1927, she married Lin Gengxin, a native of Fujian, in Shanxi. Lin then went to study in France. Li, unable to get along with Lin's family, came to Shanghai and became a dancer, achieving fame and earning a considerable income. Four years later, Lin returned from his studies and cohabited with Li at No. 2, Lane 744, Hede Road. However, Lin did not engage in legitimate work and instead spent lavishly, pawning all of Li's clothes and accessories. If Li inquired about it, she would be subjected to violence. On February 15th of last year (lunar calendar), Lin stole Li's diamond watch and pawned it. When Li questioned him, she was beaten and injured by Lin. Subsequently, Lin was detained by the court for borrowing 7,000 yuan from an Indian man, Amu Sen. He was bailed out by his girlfriend, Zhu Wenhui (a famous socialite), and has since disappeared without a trace. As a result, Li's residence at No. 135 Zhaofeng Villa, Bailinan Road, and the furniture she had acquired through her labor were sealed by the court. Li Li, due to the fact that her husband Lin Gengxin's whereabouts are unknown and that she has been subjected to abuse, believes that she cannot continue to maintain the marriage. She hired lawyer Huang Yanyan to file a lawsuit for divorce in the Special First Court and requested alimony of 2,000 yuan. The court has summoned her once, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang held a continued hearing in the Civil Fourth Court. In addition to Li Li, Huang Lifang and Lin Huifang (i.e., Ningbo Li Li), dancers from the Metropolitan Dance Hall, and the maid Wang Jinbao were also summoned to court to testify. Judge Zhang first ordered the three witnesses to leave the courtroom for separate inquiries. He then questioned Li Li about the facts of the injury she sustained in mid-March of last year (lunar calendar). According to Li, at 2:00 AM that night, she returned home from</p>
<p>the dance hall, and found that a diamond watch given to her by a patron had been stolen by Lin Gengxin. When she questioned him about it, she was beaten and knocked to the ground, injuring her foot. She was treated by Dr. Fang Jiacheng and Dr. Ye. Lin was very violent and often beat her. Although she knew about Lin's illicit relationship with Zhu Wenhui, she did not witness it. She had to go to the dance hall every night after 10:00 PM and return home at 2:00 AM. During that time, only Lin and Zhu were at home, and Zhu was her friend. Zhu moved into her house around January of last year and presented a photo to prove</p>
<p>her marriage to Lin. The witness Huang Lifang, 21 years old, from Shanghai, who lives with the plaintiff, testified that Lin often bullied Li. She said that she personally saw Lin slap Li and push her out the door during the beating in mid-March. As for Zhu Wenhui and Lin, they have been missing since Zhu bailed Lin out of court. The court then presented the pawn ticket submitted by the plaintiff and asked if the writing on the back was by Lin. Huang confirmed that it was indeed written by Lin. The witness Wang Jinbao then testified that she was the plaintiff's maid and testified to Lin's</p>
<p>abuse of the plaintiff. She also pointed out the person wearing glasses in the photo as Lin Gengxin. Ningbo Li Li (Lin Huifang), 22 years old, residing at No. 14, Zunde Chong, Dong Youheng Road, Hongkou, testified that Lin's treatment of Li was very bad. Li had to report to Lin and give him 100 yuan to pay the rent for the residence on Terrace Road. Instead, Lin spent it. The court showed her the photo and pawn ticket. She pointed out Lin's face and confirmed that the writing on the back of the pawn ticket was written by Lin. The court, finding the facts clear, ordered lawyer Huang to make a closing argument for one side, then announced the conclusion of the hearing and set the judgment for the 20th.</p>

<h3>After a Car from Dinghai Island Plunged into the River, Two More Bodies Were Retrieved Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the 12th of this month, a car from Dinghai Island plunged into the Huangpu River near Yangshupu, drowning seven employees of Yu Run Trading Company in Xiaodongmen and Tongren Chang Trading Company, as well as the driver, A Mao. The Water Patrol Police and the Yangshupu Police hired water ghosts and boatmen to begin the salvage operation. They have since recovered the bodies of Ye Shuping, Hu Jinglian, and Gu Cangsu. The whereabouts of the remaining five people were still unknown. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the body of the driver, A Mao, suddenly floated to the surface of the Huangpu River in the Nanshi area. A patrol boat spotted it and brought the body ashore to a hospital for examination before sending it to the coroner's office. At the same time, instructions were issued to all patrol boats to continue to pay attention. Sure enough, at around 9:00 PM in the same location, another floating body was discovered. It is reported that this was an employee of Tongren Chang Trading Company. However, as the face was blurry, it could not be identified without the family's confirmation. The police are currently summoning the families of the deceased to come to identify the body.</p>
<h3>After the Death of Silk Merchant Chen Yiting, His Two Daughters Sue for Inheritance</h3>
<p>They Sue Their Brother for 20,000 Each; The Judge Orders Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>Chen Yiting, a wealthy merchant from Nanxiang who made his fortune in the silk trade, accumulated considerable wealth. In addition to several silk shops in Shanghai, he also owned extensive farmlands. After Yiting died in 1917, his inheritance was managed by his wife, Fan. When Fan died the year before last, all the inheritance was passed on to her son, Yucheng. Recently, Yucheng's younger sisters, Chen Yiying and Chen Yifen, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit for division of property against Chen Yucheng in the Civil Court of the First Special Court. They stated that the plaintiffs and defendant are siblings and that their mother, Xu, died early. They were raised by their stepmother, Fan. Their father, Yiting, owned houses, land, and silk shops worth over 100,000 yuan. When their father passed away in 1917, the inheritance was managed by Fan. When their stepmother, Fan, passed away on May 20th the year before last, she stated to the two plaintiffs while ill that you were both liked by your father and that he wanted to leave you an inheritance, so you should each receive 40,000 yuan. After their stepmother's death, they repeatedly negotiated with the defendant, but to no avail. They are now requesting that the defendant be ordered to divide the inheritance of Yiting and give each plaintiff 20,000 yuan. The Special Court has summoned the defendant, Chen Yucheng, who also hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a defense, stating that the inheritance began before women had inheritance rights over non-inherited property. According to the law at the time, women could be granted an inheritance, but if the inheritance had already been legally inherited by a man and the woman or her legal representative did not object at the time of the inheritance, she cannot claim an inheritance after the man has legally inherited the property. This is according to the precedent set by the Supreme Court in Case No. 1147 of the 23rd year. The defendant's father, Yiting, died in 1917, and his inheritance was legally inherited by the defendant. Although the plaintiffs are Yiting's daughters, women had no inheritance rights over non-inherited property when Yiting's inheritance began. Furthermore, Chen Yiying and Yifen's weddings to the Yingchuan and Fan families were handled by their late mother, Fan, and the defendant. In addition to the expenses of approximately 3,000 yuan for each wedding, Fan and the defendant granted Yiying a house and jewelry and cash worth approximately 3,000 yuan, and granted Yifen cash of 500 yuan, a savings book worth 2,500 yuan, and clothing worth 100 yuan. Therefore, the defendant has already made adequate payments to the plaintiffs and requests that the plaintiffs' lawsuit be dismissed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo held a continued hearing in the Civil Sixth Court and advised both parties to make concessions to avoid siblings engaging in endless litigation. Both parties expressed their willingness to reconcile, and the case was adjourned to the 21st for a retrial, ordering them to attempt to reconcile outside of court.</p>
<h3>An Apprentice with Bad Intentions Fled to Suzhou with a Large Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Lodged in a Hotel and Solicited Prostitutes</p>
<p>He Was Discovered by Detectives and Arrested in Suzhou</p>
<p>Xiao Yunqiao, also known as Xiao Mingying, from Jiaxing, is 21 years old and was an apprentice at the Yadong Wireless Radio Station opened by Yu Guozhen at No. 47, Lane 740, Fuxu Road. On the 12th of this month, Yu Guozhen gave Xiao 2,500 yuan in national currency to deposit at the Jing'an Temple Road branch of the Bank of China and brought a bank draft for 2,200 yuan. Unexpectedly, Xiao Yunqiao had bad intentions and did not deposit the money, but instead embezzled it, abandoned his job, and fled. Yu reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting an investigation. After obtaining the money, Xiao purchased clothes and leather shoes and took a car to Suzhou overnight. He lodged in Room 218 of the Dadong Hotel at No. 19, Shiquan Street, and spent money soliciting prostitute Yunbao to accompany him. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by Chinese detective Zhang Liang and detective Xia Yushan of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. They reported this to the First Special Court, prepared official documents, and went to Suzhou yesterday to arrest Xiao Yunqiao in conjunction with the local Public Security Bureau police detectives. They confiscated 321 yuan in national currency and two postal money orders to Jiaxing, each for 1,000 yuan, as well as clothes and other items. They were escorted back to Shanghai and handed over to the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code and stated the facts of the case, saying that apart from the confiscated money orders and cash, only 179 yuan was missing. The defendant also admitted in the police station that he had used the money to buy clothes and solicit prostitutes. The police are currently unable to withdraw the 2,000 yuan from the postal money orders, so they requested an adjournment and asked for official documents to be issued to the police station so that they can withdraw the money from the post office. When questioned, Xiao Yunqiao confessed everything. Judge Tan Xinzhen examined the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained pending a retrial in seven days.</p>

<h3>Woman Zhou Wang and Others Indicted for Multiple Theft Cases</h3>
<p>Defendant's Lawyer Claims They Were Framed by Li Xiaobao, Who Is at Large</p>
<p>Requests That Xu Xueqin, Who Has Been Arrested, Be Brought to Court for Questioning First</p>
<p>Zhou Wang, a woman from Jiancheng, and Xu Heshun, Xia San, Sun Jiaoyou, Wang Shaoqing, Zhang Bao, Li Yizhi, Wang Liangyu, Zhang Yijiang, and others were arrested by the Ximen Branch Investigation Team for theft and handed over to the local court prosecutor for indictment. It is stated that Zhou Wang and Zhou Yitong are in a concubine relationship and are acquainted with the escaped rogue Zheng Xiaoshouzi. On December 31st of last year, Zhou Wang bought three Wu Yugui pistols and thirty bullets. The next day, January 1st of this year, Zheng Xiaoshouzi borrowed two pistols from Zhou Wang and, together with Li Yizhi (Li Dadaizi), Wang Shaoqing (Ding Kezhen), Xia San (Chen San, also known as Lihua), and the escaped Lao Wu, Ni Xiaolaohan, Sun Yaowu, Tian Guibao, and others, killed Wu Fugui (Lao Er) on Dapuqiao Road. On the 6th of the same month, Zhou Wang again brought a pistol and handed it over to Zheng Xiaoshouzi, who, together with the escaped Yang Defu and others, robbed the Xinqiaotou cigarette paper shop. On the 7th, Zhou Wang again lent two pistols to Yang Defu, Zhou Yitong, and the escaped Xiao Mao, Xu Xueqing, and others to rob police officer Liu Fengqi's home on Haichang Road of goldware and other items. On the 8th, she again lent two pistols to Zhou Yitong, Sun Jiaoyou, Zhang Bao, Wang Liangyu, Zhang Yijiang, and the escaped Xiao Kuaizi, Xu Defu, and others to rob the Chen Shunxing bamboo shop on Fangxie Road of national currency, clothing, and other items, and also robbed patrol officer Hu Quanxia of his pistol. In May, Zheng Xiaoshouzi again borrowed two pistols from Zhou Wang and, together with Zhang Cunsheng, Cao Sili, and others, robbed the Oujia Road rickshaw company. In November, the escaped Lv Jinkui entrusted Zhang Bao to carry a pistol to Xu Heshun to return to Zhou Wang. The investigators successively investigated and solved the case and should be sentenced according to the law for robbery and murder. Yesterday, Judge Chen Kangsun opened a court hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Liu Xiang to defend them, stating that there should be a statement made before the trial. All the details of this case were recently fabricated by Li Xiaobao, the escaped head of the Ximen Investigation Team who is wanted by the Public Security Bureau for colluding with bandits and making false cases to avoid punishment, and by Xu Xueqin, a bandit raised by detective Jin Yushan, to shift the blame and frame the defendant. The defendant was forced to confess under torture to profit from colluding with bandits and to gain rewards by harming others. Fortunately, the First Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau investigated the circumstances of Xu Xueqin's imprisonment in the cases filed by the defendant and captured Xu Xueqin at Li Xiaobao's home. After examining various confessions, the local newspapers on the 14th of this month published lengthy reports, clearly stating that all the facts were related to the facts listed in the indictment. Therefore, all the defendants were wronged and suffered from the detectives' false accusations. They requested that Xu Xueqin be brought to court from the Public Security Bureau for questioning to clear their names and presented a newspaper reporting Li Xiaobao's collusion with bandits and escape. The supervising officials read it and granted the request. The case was adjourned for a continued hearing, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Adjournment of the Coffee Tea Trademark Infringement Case</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Company Coffee Company, located at No. 39 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, has been established for many years and specializes in producing Xingxing brand coffee tea, which is inexpensive and of good quality. Unexpectedly, Yu Huanzhang of Gan Tai Company, Yang Jiyou of Ri Xin Company, and others sought to profit illegally. In January of last year, they jointly counterfeited the Xingxing brand coffee tea produced by the company and created Yixing, Yuxing, Sanxing, and other brands that were similar in name and appearance to counterfeit the Xingxing brand for sale on the market. When the employer discovered this, the company's manager, Lu Rongzhang, reported it to the police station, which sent Western detective Ting Delan to the Gan Tai Company and seized dozens of boxes of counterfeit Xingxing brand coffee tea. They also seized printing plates and empty boxes at Yang Jiyou's home in the Chinese district and were detained. On January 29th of last year, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Criminal Eighth Court of the Second Court interrogated them. The police station's lawyer, Fei Xizhen, filed a public prosecution, and the defendants hired lawyers to defend them. On February 1st, the verdict was announced. Defendant Yang Jiyou was sentenced to a fine of 100 yuan and two months of imprisonment for counterfeiting trademarks with the intention of deceiving others. Defendant Yu Huanwei of Zhi Tai Company was sentenced to a fine of 300 yuan for knowingly selling counterfeit trademarked goods. All seized Yixing, Jinxing, and Yixing empty boxes and printing plates were confiscated. However, the plaintiff, Guangzhou Company, suffered huge losses of over 5,000 yuan due to the counterfeiting and requested compensation of 3,000 yuan in a private lawsuit. On February 3rd, Judge Liao of the Seventh Court of the First Special Court legally ruled that the defendants should jointly compensate the plaintiff 1,000 yuan in national currency. The defendants, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal represented by lawyer Wang Hengyi. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Higher Third Court opened a hearing. Both lawyers also appeared in court to argue, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month.</p>

<p>Jin Shaoshan, a famous Peking opera singer who is currently performing at the Golden Grand Theater in Baxianqiao, resides at No. 5 Jian'an Lane, Kaiziyun Road, French Concession. The monthly rent for the house is 84 yuan, which is managed by the Trust Department of Zhejiang Industrial Bank.

<p>Expansion of Amusement - According to the person in charge of the association, the work of promoting national products cannot achieve significant results without actions that align with the public's psychology. Therefore, during the prosperous period of the National Products Movement Exhibition in this city, a special amusement section is attached to increase the interest of guests. Admission is free for visitors. These amusement tickets will be distributed to various factories as gifts. The performance programs will be limited to those that are most relevant to the current times and have a deep relationship with national products. The association is currently seeking well-known artists in the city to participate.</p>
<p>Product Review - The association will strictly review the products of participating manufacturers before allowing them to be displayed and sold. It also intends to participate in the city's international preliminary competition, so the review work is extremely important.

It is heard that in addition to the heads of various agencies and bureaus in the city, the review committee members are all well-known figures from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>Use Domestically Produced Silk Fabrics for Clothing - Lake Society Petitions the Ministry to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The Lake Society petitioned the Ministry to pay attention to domestically produced silk fabrics when revising clothing regulations. The original petition is as follows: "We received a letter from the Department of Customs and Traditions of your Ministry (Ministry of Interior), stating, 'Our Ministry is currently revising the clothing regulations with reference to the resolution of the Executive Yuan this month regarding clothing. We urgently need to collect materials related to clothing from various agencies and organizations for reference. Your society is known to have a great deal of research on national clothing regulations. We hereby request that you examine and send the full set of chapters, rules, patterns, or publications related to clothing for research. We would be especially grateful for any detailed insights.' Upon receiving this, we found that the dress codes for men and women had already been stipulated by your (Ministry of Interior) and were promulgated by the National Government on April 16 of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. All materials used domestically produced goods, considering both aspects, which was well received by the people. Our society once submitted a petition to the National Government, your Yuan (Executive Yuan), and your Ministry (Ministry of Interior), instructing all provinces and subordinate offices that from now on, all memorial weeks for the Premier, important meetings, and celebrations and funerals should be handled accordingly. Based on the previous circumstances, we immediately contacted the Shanghai Silk Fabric Industry Association and the Shanghai Electric Silk Fabric Industry Association for detailed discussions. They all believed that Chapter 1 of the previous clothing regulations of your (Ministry of Interior) was the dress code system, and the resolution of your (Executive) Yuan on clothing was a uniform style. Dress codes should be adapted to local conditions and emphasize solemnity. Therefore, international dress codes and civilian dress codes differ in quality but are all appropriate. Uniforms should be adapted to the circumstances and strive for convenience. Therefore, although the forms of uniforms for male and female civil servants differed in the previously established clothing regulations, they each served their purpose. It seems unnecessary to conduct extensive research on clothing regulations this time, but some planning should be done on the materials. The matter is done. For clothing materials, dress codes generally use silk fabrics, and silk and satin are all domestic products, except for those otherwise stipulated internationally. However, since uniforms vary slightly depending on the complexity of the task, materials also vary depending on the price. After all, the domestic production of woollen cloth is very small, and there is a great shortage. The mechanical weaving of cotton and linen cloth is limited, and there is even more sighing that we are not as good as others. If we insist on seeking them, we will inevitably have to use foreign goods, which greatly violates the intention of your Ministry to promote domestic products. However, silk fabrics are a unique product of our country. As for whether they are suitable for use as uniforms, it all depends on the uniform style set by the Ministry of Interior. In order to facilitate the Ministry of Interior's reference when revising uniforms, we have prepared fifteen types of silk fabrics and two sheets of patterns and respectfully submit them. We hope you will examine them. We hope that when revising clothing regulations, you will implicitly block loopholes and promote silk weaving while promoting domestic products, which will benefit the people and the country. We respectfully submit to the Ministry of Interior of the National Government and the Executive Yuan of the National Government. Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Lake Society Committee."</p>

<h3>Completion of Road Construction in Two Townships Under County Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The construction of the Beiche and Huagou Township roads, which were contracted by the Shanghai County Government this year, began in early last month and was scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. The farmers in each section were able to work hard, so the road works on both roads have been completed ahead of schedule. The road surface is wide, with two and a half meters, and rickshaws can travel back and forth, greatly facilitating rural traffic. According to reports from the district chiefs yesterday, County Chief Ye ordered them to lead the construction director Qi Kezhong to inspect and accept the roads before reporting to Jiangsu Construction to send personnel for inspection and acceptance.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Prefecture's Tomb Relocation Case - Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association...Reply from Zhejiang Provincial Government - Exemption from Relocation if Not Within Designated Land Use Area</h3>
<p>Regarding the Ningbo Prefecture's plan to demolish and relocate tombs in various townships, the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association has sent repeated telegrams to the provincial and central governments to fight for it. It is heard that the association received a reply yesterday from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Ref. No. 1259, stating, "Your telegram is acknowledged. Regarding the Yin County's handling of the demolition and relocation of tombs, we have previously ordered the county to correct it based on your association's cable petition in April, and we have ordered the county to report the handling process in detail and reply for acknowledgement. Subsequently, the province formulated four supplementary measures and ordered the postal county district administrative inspector and the Yin County magistrate to investigate and handle each case. According to the telegram, in addition to ordering the respective inspector and county magistrate to register and repair actual tombs not located within the designated land use area in accordance with the provisions of the supplementary measures, there is no need to demolish them. The original tombs located within the public cemetery area shall also be exempted from relocation in accordance with the repair measures. On the one hand, strictly investigate unruly people who excavate tombs and actively build public cemeteries. This approval is for acknowledgement. This approval shows that there is no need to demolish actual tombs not located within the designated land use area. The original tombs located within the public cemetery area can also be exempted from relocation in accordance with the repair measures, which further proves that the previous actions of various townships in Ningbo Prefecture to demolish and relocate tombs were too hasty."</p>

<p>The Fuchang Ginseng Store on Li Xian Gua Street in Nanshi was robbed by seven or eight burglars with handguns at 2:00 AM several nights ago. They stole valuables worth tens of thousands of yuan, including diamond rings, diamond earrings, diamond-encrusted bracelets, Xin Guangzhu headdresses, pearl necklaces, pearl phoenixes, pearl-edged flowers, pearl brooches, pearl flowers, pearl butterflies, jade watch pins, small diamond rings with pendants, Omega platinum pocket watches, Fan Ligen gold coat hangers, scattered beaded necklaces, red gold bracelets, gold锡杖 [pilgrim staff], large pearl AC bracelets, small diamond rings, and other valuable finished pieces totaling 37 items, as well as watches and scattered ornaments. They also stole a self-defense handgun from the store. At the time, the store was deeply concerned that if the incident was publicized, the stolen goods would be hidden or scattered to other ports. Therefore, they reported the theft to the local Yemiao Police Station and notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the British and French police, as well as pawnshops, diamond markets, and other shops in the city, to detain any of the stolen goods if found. In addition, telegrams were sent to major commercial ports such as Beijing, Suzhou, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, instructing agencies and pawnshops to pay attention to the arrest. Yesterday, it was learned that the case has been solved. The French Concession police arrested a robber who injured a person on the road. The handgun he was carrying was the self-defense handgun stolen from the麦行 [wheat store]. The serial number has been verified. They are currently searching for the remaining accomplices. The Detective Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has also learned of the case and is cooperating in the investigation, it is said.</p>

<h3>Second Day of Elementary School Joint Sports Meet; Boys' Inner Standing Long Jump Sets New Record; Tao Xueyuan of Shanghai No. 2 School Achieves 4.49 Meters; All Finals to be Held Today on the Last Day</h3>
<p>The eighth annual Joint Elementary School Sports Meet of this city entered its second day yesterday. The atmosphere remained excellent. Mayor Wu and Director Pan personally visited the venue to inspect the proceedings and award medals. The results of various finals were commendable. Today's program consists entirely of finals, promising even fiercer competition and greater excitement across districts. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Athletics Results</p>
<p>Yesterday's finals, including exhibition events, totaled nine. In the boys' Class C standing long jump, Tao Xueyuan of Shanghai No. 2 School broke the previous record of 4.373 meters held by Wang Jinhua of Tonghui with a jump of 4.49 meters, earning the admiration of the spectators. In the boys' Class A pole vault, Ge Xizhi of Yangjing School achieved a height of 2.59 meters, narrowly missing the highest record of 2.63 meters. Considering the weight restrictions imposed on the Class A group this year, this achievement is truly commendable. Additionally, the boys' Class B standing long jump surpassed two meters with a top four selection.</p>
<p>Group Performances</p>
<p>Yesterday's group gymnastics performances included forty-two sections. Among the higher grades, Pengnan's fitness dance, Minsheng's Mei's three-person freehand exercises, and Dehua's Tan Tui were the most proficient, lively, and aesthetically pleasing. In the middle grades, Xinmin's small flag exercises, Hongzhen's sailor exercises, Longde's fitness exercises, and Dongming's three-section exercises all achieved excellent results. Among the lower and kindergarten grades, the City No. 1 Kindergarten's small orchestra, Jiangde's small air defense team, Youying's little white rabbit, and Huiqun's tumbler were well-trained and performed energetically, earning the audience's praise. Furthermore, Huihui's freehand exercises and Zhongshan's three-section teaching materials were also noteworthy.</p>
<p>Finals Sketches</p>
<p>The boys' Class A pole vault was the most popular event among the audience. More than ten participants competed, with only six remaining above two meters. Champion Ge Xizhi soared high with a graceful posture and excellent arm strength, making his 2.59-meter achievement hard-earned. Xu Daxin came in second with 2.41 meters, Xu Miaogen third with 2.32 meters, Qin Miaochun fourth with 2.25 meters, Tang Ruixiang fifth with 2.19 meters, and Huang Jiaren sixth with 2.0725 meters.</p>
<p>The boys' Class A shot put was another masterpiece by Ge Xizhi. Although his 13.46-meter result fell short of the highest record, given his young age and small stature, future improvements are certain. Yao Shungeng, the previous record holder in Class B, now competing in Class A, did not perform as well as he hoped, achieving 12.51 meters. Tang Hongsheng came in third with 11.43 meters, Chen Zhuangfu fourth with 10.90 meters, Zhu Yingen fifth with 9.88 meters, and Huang Xiongjian sixth with 9.80 meters.</p>
<p>Ni Fengjia of Class B standing long jump, performed erratically in practice. This time he scored 4.479 meters, expressing dissatisfaction. Chen Genmei placed second with 4.44 meters, Liang Yuanming third with 4.33 meters, Li Zhenfan fourth with 4.31 meters, Zhao Zhongfang fifth with 4.311 meters, and Fang Wenzuo sixth with 4.25 meters.</p>
<p>Tao Xueyuan of Shanghai No. 2 School was very pleased with his Class C standing long jump, breaking previous records with 4.49 meters and exceeding the Class B record of this competition, making him a promising talent. Mo Qiu came in second with 4.20 meters, Zhu Renyong third with 4.13 meters, Ding Fugeng fourth with 4.04 meters, Wang Yebiao fifth, and Wang Baodi sixth, both with 4.03 meters.</p>
<p>Zhou Qinhua of Shanghai No. 2 School, a female athlete from Wanzhu, was the Class B record holder in the Class A softball throw. Now competing in Class A, she still won the championship with a commendable score of 33.85 meters. Yang Jinzhen came in second with 33.71 meters, Zhang Huizhu third with 32.41 meters, Wei Shaoyu fourth with 30.98 meters, Yang Qiaozhen fifth with 29.18 meters, and Zhou Zufeng sixth with 28.82 meters.</p>
<p>There were many contenders in the girls' Class B softball throw. Zhou Xiangjuan rose to the championship with a final throw of 30.43 meters. Jiang Xianzizhi came in second with 29 meters, Liu Bixi third with 28.41 meters, Bai Lianying fourth with 20.77 meters, Lin Aizhen fifth with 25.94 meters, and Lin Aizhen sixth with 25.88 meters.</p>
<p>Li Tianzhu of the girls' Class B standing long jump hoped to break the old record of 2.16 meters but unfortunately, her leg strength was impaired after participating in track events, stopping at 2.10 meters, which was regrettable. Zheng Shuying came in second with 1.02 meters, Du Ruyong third with 2 meters, Zhou Xiangjuan fourth with 1.99 meters, Zhong Jifang fifth with 1.985 meters, and Zhang Fengmei sixth with 1.96 meters.</p>

<h3>Children's Educational Toys Exhibition to Open Tomorrow in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The National Children's Educational Toys Exhibition is scheduled to open on May 17th, with a duration of ten days (from the 17th to the 26th). The venue is located at the National Products Exhibition Hall on Huaiqing Bridge in the capital. The entrance is the main hall of the building, and the exit is the National Products Shopping Mall. The association has designated May 18th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 24th, 25th, and 26th to host elementary, middle, and normal school student groups from Nanjing. The schedule has been arranged and notified to various schools by the Social Affairs Bureau. Students from each school will enter in organized groups with notification from the Social Affairs Bureau. Individual visits were originally planned to be open to the public without restrictions. However, the organizing committee, realizing that the population of Nanjing is large and the exhibition area is small, making it practically impossible to accommodate an excessive number of visitors, decided after repeated discussions to issue 7,000 exhibition tickets for individual visits each day for the four days open to individuals. To ensure an even distribution of visitors, the exhibition tickets issued for mornings and afternoons will be different colors, and the date and time will be noted on the tickets. Anyone visiting the exhibition must arrive on time according to the date and time specified on the ticket, or the ticket will be invalid. Furthermore, the shopping mall located in the National Products Exhibition Hall will open on the same day as the exhibition, and it is planned to give away exhibition tickets for purchases of one yuan or more in the shopping mall.</p>

Zhang Baoshan, the head of the delegation, said, "The Weihai area has a population of 220,000. Since the takeover, educational affairs have been quite developed. In the previous British administration, there was almost no education to speak of. In the past six years, the number of primary schools has increased from seven to more than 200, with four middle schools and one horticultural sericulture vocational school, all newly established after the takeover. Compulsory education was started three years ago. About 120 short-term primary school classes have been established in the area, but due to financial difficulties, they have not been fully developed. The new Commissioner, Sun Xifeng, attaches great importance to education. This delegation was ordered to go to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to study primary and secondary schools and vocational education. We set off from Weihai on the 21st of last month and visited Qingdao, Jinan, Tai'an, Qufu, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places along the way. The school authorities in various places have a strong spirit of research and improvement. The plan and implementation of the integration of politics and education in Qingdao, in particular, left a deep impression on the delegation. Yesterday, all members of the delegation visited Mr. He Shuangqiu, Dean of the College of Education of Daxia University, to seek guidance on various issues related to people's livelihood education. Mr. He gave us very sincere guidance, and the delegation is deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Hosts Overseas Chinese Inspection Group</h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese return to China inspection groups from Nanyang, the Philippines, Surabaya, and Sambo Long in Siam have arrived in Shanghai one after another. Ms. Lu Lihua, principal of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School in Jiangwan, Shanghai, hosted a tea party for all members of the three inspection groups in the school auditorium at 3 PM yesterday, in return for the warm hospitality she received from overseas Chinese during her past visits to Nanyang to study physical education. More than 30 people attended. Principal Lu delivered a welcome speech, followed by a response from Mr. Huang Chaolong, president of the Surabaya Chamber of Commerce, and others. After the tea party, the school students performed various performances, including gymnastics, national defense, and music. After the performance, Principal Lu led a tour of the school. The guests were deeply impressed by the school's perfect facilities and clean layout, and especially admired Principal Lu's spirit of running and managing the school.</p>

<h3>Returning from the Girls' Association Trip</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>The "Girls' Association" established by the Shanghai Women's Education Center held its ninth general meeting in Kunshan last Sunday. Although I am not a woman, I was specially invited by the director of the center, Zhou Zhaoshao, to participate as a guest. The chairman and leader of this trip was Ms. Hu Ruichan. When the group was visiting the Banyuan Garden, I asked many questions: "When was your association established? What is its purpose? How many members are there? Can girls from outside the association participate? Is there a limit to the number of travelers?"</p>
<p>Ms. Hu, like a weaver skilled at warp and weft, analyzed it for me layer by layer: "Our association was planned around August of last year and officially established in September. The purpose is to use the natural and quiet environment to travel on the one hand, and on the other hand, to propose pre-determined topics for everyone to discuss, so as to connect feelings, exchange knowledge, supervise each other, and seek progress together, hoping that the girls' world will achieve physical and mental health and development. The organization is very simple, with one chairman and two secretaries, and everyone takes turns to elect them. There are more than one hundred members, and there are still joining, and it has not been counted yet! Girls from outside are also welcome to participate, as long as they have the right consciousness, act openly and uprightly, and are willing to take on the responsibility of saving the country in this extraordinary period, without being impatient; without exaggerating, and down-to-earth to transform themselves first, all those who have this spirit are welcome. As for the membership fee, it is very small. Before the trip, a precise budget is made for the destination, and it is enough to use, and it is paid in advance by each person participating in the trip..., and there is no limit to the number of people..."</p>
<p>The topic discussed this time was "the issue of service". Although I didn't listen carefully in order to capture the dynamic state of their problems, the different tones and different reasons around the rectangular table seemed to be able to grasp the core of "service", taking into account both theory and facts, and trying to give full play to it.</p>
<h3>At the Entrance of Banyuan Garden</h3>
<p>After the meeting, we climbed the mountain and visited the garden. After a drizzle, walking on the muddy and slippery path, unafraid of the difficulties of wind and rain, moving bravely upwards, unlike the weakness of old-fashioned girls, but fully expressing the healthy and beautiful posture of new girls. After coming back, I felt that it is necessary to promote the proper activities of girls everywhere</p>
<h3>A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN WOMEN'S OCCUPATIONS THROUGH NUMBERS</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>The United States is a country with the most developed women's occupations, which is known to everyone. However, to what extent are American women's occupations developed? This question is difficult to answer because there are no relevant statistics available for reference. However, according to Dr. Nelson, an economist in New York, a five-year survey since 1931 showed that working women in New York City accounted for 69.4% of all women aged 16 to 60, which is more than two-thirds of the total population. About 870,000 (excluding students).</p>
<p>New York City is a commercial center. With the development of commerce, all kinds of entertainment and enjoyment naturally follow and prosper extremely. For example, the world-famous Broadway is a major destination in New York. Therefore, in New York, the distribution of women in occupations is as follows: Clerks (including salespersons, female clerks in stores, bank clerks, advertisers and canvassers employed in various stores, etc.) account for 27.5%. Dancers, waitresses, singers, movie stars, announcers, actors, etc. account for 13.7%. Those who work in factories or do handicrafts at home account for 8.5%. Educators account for 1.1%. Doctors, midwives, nurses, etc. account for 0.8%. Clergy, etc. account for 2.0%. Those who are cooks, sweepers, or nannies who take care of children in various public places and homes account for 13.3%. Those who work in various national agencies, such as transportation, municipal bureaus, etc., account for 0.7%. Those who work for newspapers, magazines, or other publishing companies, and only hold the position of writing, account for 0.6%. Secret prostitution accounts for 2.2%. Others, such as jurists, artists, etc., freelancers, account for 9.3%. Unspecified occupations account for 3.9%. The rest are unemployed, accounting for about 16.4%.</p>
<p>Among the approximately 870,000 working women mentioned above, American citizens account for 57.7%. European citizens account for 21.2%. Central and South American and Canadian citizens account for 12.5%. Asian citizens account for 4.7%. The rest are from the Philippines, Australia, and other continents. The age distribution is as follows: 16 years old accounts for 4.1%. 17 to 20 years old accounts for 15.2%. 21 to 25 years old accounts for 27.5%. 26 to 30 years old accounts for 25.8%. 31 to 38 years old accounts for 14.2%. 39 to 50 years old accounts for 9.5%. 51 to 60 years old accounts for 3.7%. Among them, most of those over 31 years old are jurists, artists, national agency staff, clergy, doctors, teachers, writers in the publishing industry, scientists, designers, workers, servants, etc. Clerks, waitresses, dancers, singers, etc. are mostly between the ages of 17 and 25. The age of the unemployed, between 26 and 38 years old, accounts for the largest number, accounting for about 67% of the total number of unemployed.</p>
<p>Among these 870,000 working women, university graduates, including those with degrees at all levels, account for 7.3% of the total. Those who did not graduate from university account for 11.3%. High school graduates account for 44.1%. Those who did not graduate from middle school account for 14.7%. Elementary school graduates account for 16.5%. Those who did not graduate from elementary school and those who did not go to school account for 6.1%. Among all the working women, married women account for 45.3%. After marriage, divorced women living alone account for 25.6%. In these two categories, those with children each account for about one-third. Those who have never been married account for 29.1%. As for income, the highest is $5,000 per week. The lowest is $24 per week, or $10 per month. But the most common is $40 to $50 per week, or $150 to $200 per month, accounting for about 57.9% of the total. Those below these figures account for 8.7%. Those with weekly income of $50 to $100 account for 28.0% of the total. Those with weekly income of more than $100 account for 5.1%. As for those with more than $1,000, it is less than 0.01%. And those with less than $10 per week also only account for less than 10.0%. Working women who own cars account for 8.7% of the total. Those who live in the suburbs account for 35.5% of the total. The remaining 65.5% who live in the city, 47.3% of them are in apartments. According to Mr. Nelson's survey, those who own real estate, fixed deposits, and investments in real estate account for 12.9% of all working women. Those who are in debt account for 25.9%. Those with unknown economic conditions account for 11.3%. The rest are just barely making ends meet with their income.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Nelson's statistics are limited to the New York area, and the basis for his statistics is only based on the induction of various scattered records, without reliable and systematic documents for reference, so his statistics may not be so reliable. However, looking at the figures in his statistics, we may be able to get a glimpse of the working women in America's first commercial port.</p>
<h3>THE COURSE OF A SELF-DESCRIBED LOVE AFFAIR</h3>
<p>— Chen Lin Xingyun</p>
<p>One morning in late spring.</p>
<p>The faint red glow in the sky gradually rises, and everything on the earth is dyed with bright colors. The tender green grass seems to wake up after sleeping, stretching its waist and slowly straightening up. Hundreds of flowers are shy, with buds about to bloom; birds are singing happily and freely; the surroundings of nature are full of harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>He, under the warm and gentle nurturing of nature, took a ten-minute deep breath, and immediately cheered up his full spirit. His plump and beautiful face was even more adorable. From that time on, my ardent and impulsive heart in early spring single-mindedly targeted him and kept pursuing him.</p>
<p>But he did not pay any attention to my pursuit, which made me suffer infinitely. Perhaps he was not "cold-blooded" at the time, but "pure," because he was only sixteen years old. Perhaps he would not have a deep understanding of the true meaning of "suffering," but I was a year older than him, and I was already urgently requesting a male companion who "has a sincere attitude, rich knowledge, a pure soul, a firm will, a healthy body, and a courageous spirit."</p>
<p>His test scores in school were always listed as excellent, and the teachers praised him unanimously, and many students admired him. He was taciturn, with a smile on his face all day long. When students had questions in their books, they would take them to him for discussion. He would always humbly answer them in as much detail as he could, and would never disappoint you. And me? The most common method of enticing him in every possible way was to often pick out difficult questions to discuss with him for a long time. Sometimes, I would unconsciously involve "love," but he never even slightly understood. My pursuit failed. His bad hobby was reading. He had a medium-height figure, his hair was combed up and then parted to both sides, a peach-colored face, a moderately sized nose, a small mouth, and a naive and pure heart, attracting me to pursue him with reluctance.</p>
<p>The bullying of female students by male students is a very common and frequently discovered phenomenon in schools, but he is often in a neutral position to help female students. Male students try every possible means to please female students, and even neglect their sleep and meals to miss their beloved female students day and night. This is also a common phenomenon after male students suffer from their nature, but he has a pure heart, understands his own position, and concentrates on his studies, and will never have such evil thoughts to disturb his body and mind. But me? There were also four male classmates who were full of enthusiasm and willing to give up their books to pursue me, but I always thought that some were too crude and only knew how to pursue women monotonously, thinking that it was their duty; some were too vain; some lacked knowledge; some were too cold-blooded. After my careful consideration, he—only he was the person I had in mind, the person who was my permanent companion.</p>
<p>Time is progressing non-stop. From the time I pursued him until then, half a year had passed in a hurry. For half a year, my pursuit results were still nothing, but his body was developing at a high speed. His body, which was more than four feet long, had reached about five feet. His muscles were developed and strong, and his bright red cheeks were like the blood flowing from a strong man, which made me even more emotional.</p>
<p>The hot summer still left its residual power—shooting out a weak glow—the crows were chirping, preparing to return to their nests. It was another summer dusk. In a small garden, I was talking and laughing with him side by side. Suddenly, he kissed me and held my hand, unwilling to let go. With a grateful tone, he said very affectionately:</p>
<p>"For half a year, your sincere treatment of me has made me deeply feel the greatness of your love. Yes, there is only good... beauty... love: pleasant... joyful emotional world in the world. You have been pursuing me. Now I understand your true meaning. I need your comfort, and I need your encouragement even more. I want you to be my permanent companion. Finally, our future is bright." My heart was boiling. The husband of my dreams gave me what I wanted. Ah! How lucky I am!</p>
<p>Two years later, with the permission of both parents, we held a wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Now, we are on the banks of Shanghai, organizing a small family, and living a sweet married life with each other.</p>
<h3>FENG LIDEQUAN TALKS ABOUT THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL SALVATION MOVEMENT</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Developing hidden abilities, restoring inherent human rights, breaking the fetters of forging, and the entire nation will be liberated.</p>
<p>Nanjing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum nearby Mausoleum New Village, is Beijing's only Qing quiet residential area, it is said that residents are party and state dignitaries, at least rich car class; otherwise you have no qualification to live. One day, it was a sunny spring day, and I also went to New Village to see the new Western-style buildings, the light yellow houses, set off by the red and white gardens, surrounded by green pines and cypresses, the air was fresh, and the scenery was beautiful, indeed lovely and extraordinary. This rich cave heaven and blessed land, not to mention living in, even if you can enjoy it, you also have some blessings. At first glance here, it will make you forget all disasters and chaotic world, even the extraordinary national disaster, ah! Believe it or not.</p>
<p>That morning, I was going to visit Ms. Li Dequan, the wife of Feng Yuxiang. Because she is a woman with knowledge, experience, and the spirit of serving the community, and also has the interest in managing household affairs, I think the reader has long been famous. Mrs. Feng borrowed a house in the Han Mansion in Lingyuan New Village. After the messenger reported it, she happily received me. I felt very honored. Mrs. Feng had a dignified attitude and spoke fluent Beijing dialect. We talked a lot, starting from the Feng family, as well as Mrs. Feng's past, and current life. Later, she said that the private life part did not need to be talked about, and only two points could be published. This opinion is practical and pertinent, and can be used as a guide for modern women, and I respect my Shenbao readers.</p>
<p>May I ask what Mrs. thinks Chinese women should do to save the country?</p>
<p>Mrs. Feng pondered for a while, and then said eloquently: "Women's inherent abilities are not worse than men's, and women's responsibilities in the country are not lighter than men's. Today, the country is so critical, and women should also take responsibility for saving the country. But at present, 95% of Chinese women are ignorant, which is a waste of vitality and a huge loss to the country. Many people think that those ignorant women are not capable, which is wrong. In fact, they are not incapable, but they have no opportunity to show their abilities, and their abilities are buried. Just look at the women in the Soviet Union today, and you can prove it. Even the Abyssinian women in Italy, known as barbarians, when their country is invaded, don't they also do their best in the rear defense and nursing work? Even generously and excitedly take up arms to defend the country? Every woman has a sincere heart to love her family, and to love her family, she must first love the country, so she also has a passionate heart to love the country: we must enlighten them, train them, show their hidden red heart, develop their buried abilities, restore their inherent human rights, and add a fresh force to the national salvation work. Therefore, I believe that today's knowledgeable and enlightened women should earnestly contact women in production labor and rural areas," organize them, "train them, do their best, choose what is good, and work together to save the country."</p>
<h3>MRS. FENG</h3>
<p>What is your opinion on the women's movement, madam?</p>
<p>She said: "The scope of this question is too broad, and I have too many opinions. Now I will talk about what I think is most important. The past women's movement was just a simple effort to liberate women themselves. Women themselves should seek liberation, but when engaging in it, we must see clearly what is binding us. In the past, people simply blamed social discrimination and the oppression of old morals. These two are indeed shackles that bind us, but in fact, there is also an iron chain that binds us, and many people have not seen it. This iron chain not only binds women, but also binds men, and also binds the entire nation, and also binds families and ethnic groups. What is that? That is the invasion of imperialism. If we want the entire liberation of women themselves, we must first seek the entire liberation of the nation. We must not only remove the shackles, but also break the iron chains. Now the nation does not have true independence, and the country does not have actual freedom. Where can a part of our nation-women-seize true independence and freedom from? Therefore, I believe that the current women's movement must, on the one hand, work hard to unite and do the work of liberating women themselves, in order to seek equal status with men in the current social situation. On the other hand, it should follow the social movement and do the huge work of liberating the nation!" After talking for an hour, I thought it was inconvenient to say more, and there were other meetings, so I had to thank her and leave.</p>
<h3>WOMEN'S LOVE FOR BEAUTY</h3>
<p>— Xia Fei</p>
<p>Women love beauty, which is their nature, but because the social environment and perspectives of various countries are different, people in various countries have differences in their aesthetic attitudes and beauty conditions. For example, Japanese women take applying powder and rouge, wide clothes and large sleeves, heavy makeup, high hair buns, and natural feet as the standard of beauty, while Western women take waist training and long bodies as beauty, and Africans take black as beauty; only our country used to take the morbid state of bound feet and tight chests as the standard of beauty. Therefore, Xi Shi frowned because of her heart disease, and was praised by the general public as a peerless beauty, which made Dong Shi want to imitate her frown because she admired her beauty, but she never succeeded. Until modern times, Chinese women take cut hair, long clothes, natural feet and released chests as beauty; so the so-called modern women are busy competing to imitate them, so that those who used to want to learn Zhang Zhou's hair, which was as bright as a mirror, have now become fluffy curly hair and fluttering short hair.</p>
<p>However, modern women have different aesthetic concepts; some like natural beauty, while others love decorative beauty, so some so-called modern women in modern society apply thick powder on their skin, rouge on their faces, and a layer of blood-like lipstick on their lips in order to show their beauty, shave off their original eyebrows, and draw a slender arc. In this way, they go to the barber shop to perm their hair loose like a stack of waves, and wear a pair of 1936-style high heels on their feet. As for clothes, they are of course cheongsams or coats made of the latest fabrics from silk and satin shops. It seems that unless they dress up like that, they feel that they cannot meet the modern conditions and it is difficult to show their beauty.</p>
<p>However, I believe that beauty is definitely not only decorated by cosmetics or embellished by clothes. In fact, true beauty still has its basic conditions, such as: healthy physique, developed muscles, moderate figure, even contours, and lively movements.</p>
<p>Although beauty needs to be decorated, it is still 70% innate and 30% decoration. If there is no basic beauty, I believe that it is difficult to change ugliness into beauty no matter how skillful the beauty treatment is.</p>
<p>Women in the city rely on cosmetics for beauty, while women in the countryside are better at natural beauty. They are not as pampered as urban women, eating delicacies and wearing brocade clothes, squandering and enjoying themselves; they mostly serve in their own families. In addition to their daily housework and raising children, they also help their husbands in the fields. They exercise and work every day, go to bed early and get up early, so they can maintain a healthy body, develop evenly, and have a simple beauty of plain clothes and simple hairpins. Moreover, women in the countryside are mostly pure and innocent, love quietly and sincerely, are gentle and kind, and will never be as vain and pretentious as those modern women. However, there are also shortcomings, such as a lack of hygiene knowledge and a lack of knowledge about physiological health care; so often some rural women will destroy their beauty, or their physiological development will become deformed. However, we must remedy these shortcomings and also pay attention to the following points: Do not allow any pressure or damage, such as sleep, drinking, clothing, etc. Eliminate all decorative techniques or decorations that are harmful to women's bodies, such as chest binding, foot binding... The color of the face should have blood, have business, and be radiant, showing natural tenderness and beauty, and it is not appropriate to use too much powder for application. Pay attention to daily health care. Do not eat any irritating foods, such as tobacco, alcohol, sour and spicy things. Do not wear any clothes, shoes and hats that are too narrow and small. Do not use any decorations that are harmful to development and damage health.</p>
<p>Beauty is important to nature, but it also needs the help of cultivation and decoration. But this kind of decoration focuses on personal tidiness and daily health care, but it does not only rely on cosmetics, so all modern women who love beauty must know this basic beauty common sense.</p>
<h3>THE DYNAMICS OF WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD (PART 1)</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Poet Valley Housewives Club</p>
<p>The Poet Valley in the United States established a Housewives Club in February last year. The initiator was the wife of Mr. Bruce, the president of the Climson Bank in the area. The motivation for the initiation was that she felt a lack of knowledge of household management, so she wanted to organize such a club to gather housewives from noble families in a room to discuss various family problems with each other, such as economic distribution, servant management, child management, health facilities, entertainment pursuits, etc. It is stipulated that a dinner party will be held once a month to meet. This dinner party must be held in the homes of various members under special circumstances, so that the members have the opportunity to visit each other's families for reference. The club is located in Mrs. Bruce's home. When it was first established, there were only seven members, but by the end of last year, it had increased to twenty-two. It is planned that when the number of members increases to fifty, another clubhouse will be rented, and this organization will be expanded to all parts of the country.</p>
<h3>NEW WOMAN</h3>
<p>The Austrian Capital is preparing to set up a Small Girls Association</p>
<p>In Vienna, Austria, a female actress recently initiated the organization of a girls' association. The actress, named Vitolosley, is now fifty years old. Ten years ago, she was the only popular female actress in Austria, and had accumulated a lot of wealth. Now, because she is old and her beauty has faded, she has left the stage and is working hard in charity, so the Girls' Association she initiated also aims to carry out charity work. According to her announcement, she plans to donate two-thirds of her assets to the association as a foundation when the association is established. The work to be carried out includes the construction of a civilian hospital, the establishment of a shelter for wandering children, a club for the blind and deaf, and the allocation of scholarships for poor children. Each member must pay an admission fee of forty gold pounds at the time of joining the association. Each year, they must donate association fees of ten to twenty-five gold pounds. The association plans to hold two or three fundraising entertainment events each year. All members must sell admission tickets and participate in the obligation of service. Since Vitolosley announced the plan, more than 30 people have joined, almost all of whom are women with status in the country, so the future is quite optimistic.</p>
<h3>Talking About Women's Occupations</h3>
<p>— Wu Ge</p>
<p>Talking about the issue of women's occupations in China is truly somewhat pitiful.</p>
<p>Although the cries for gender equality are resonating loudly, the female staff in government institutions, large stores, and various industries are, in reality, referred to as "vases."</p>
<p>Are women incapable of working? No, look at the women in rural villages.</p>
<p>The female workers in factories, the female teachers in schools, aren't they constantly selling their abilities, serving society day and night?</p>
<p>Even though society seemingly belongs to men, even if women exhaust all their abilities, the remuneration they receive is insufficient to support their own lives. Ultimately, they must rely on men for survival. In that way, women's occupations are controlled by men.</p>
<p>Recently, the rural economy has collapsed, and people who have always relied on rural life have had their means of livelihood shattered by the tide of economic downturn.</p>
<p>Consequently, feeling that the countryside cannot sustain them, they head to the thriving metropolises in droves. Women who flee from the countryside can only work as female laborers and maids in the cities, but that yields such meager income!</p>
<p>Moreover, the major cities are affected by the global economic downturn, large companies are constantly having sales, factories are closing down one after another, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. It's not easy to survive in the big cities!</p>
<p>Therefore, those ignorant women, driven by life's necessities and tempted by vanity, reluctantly sell their bodies and their personalities, and descend into the dark abyss.</p>
<p>In that way, many deformed women's occupations vaguely emerge in the big cities.</p>
<p>By the lampposts on the streets, you can see prostitutes selling their bodies, waiting for their clients. In dance halls with melodious music, you can see dancing girls allowing people to embrace them. In massage parlors, women will give you a bath and massage. In certain secret places, you can see women performing various secret acts naked. All kinds of women are living inhuman lives, serving as toys for men. What a tragic women's occupation that is!</p>
<p>However, those housewives and young ladies who generally hide in their homes, who are provided for by men and have no worries about clothing or food, are living comfortable and happy lives day and night. When they are idle, for the sake of pleasing the men who provide for them, they spend lavishly on expensive cosmetics and clothing, dressing up in flamboyant attire to gain the affection of men. In that way, they become appendages of men and parasites of society! They never think about the responsibilities they should bear in society, nor do they think about those sisters who are struggling on the line of life, living inhuman lives. What pitiful, soulless women they are!</p>
<p>Women, in this extraordinary period, you should awaken! You should shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation just like men. You should clearly identify your goals and open up a new path.</p>

<h3>An Unreasonable Reality</h3>
<p>— Ran Ren</p>
<p>— A Bookseller's Apology</p>
<p>A: Long time no see! I imagine your library has many new developments!</p>
<p>B: It's rare to meet you today. I have many questions I want to ask a friend who is close to bookstores. You know our library is different from regular libraries. Regular libraries don't necessarily have many regular readers. We are a group of readers who have come together for our own urgent needs. So, our demands on the publishing industry are particularly profound, as if we have a special sensitivity. We feel that the "book panic" in our country's publishing and reading circles is deepening day by day. First, I ask you, what exactly are your bookstores up to? Why are you all desperately excavating antiques, completely ignoring the needs of the majority of knowledge-seeking youth?</p>
<p>A: The question you raise is too overwhelming. I am a mid-level employee of a small bookstore, not qualified to represent the publishing industry to answer this big question for you. But this question is closely related to my profession, and I am very willing to discuss it with you. I would like to report to you what I know about the publishing industry, and it can be considered "casting a brick to attract jade," in order to learn from your valuable insights. Now, first, I must ask you to explain, what do you mean by the book panic in our country's publishing and reading circles that you just mentioned?</p>
<p>B: "Book panic" is a term I originally coined, derived from the term "food panic." Good reading material suitable for knowledge-seeking youth, aren't we calling them "intellectual food"? Now, bookstores are vying with each other to reprint old books. I believe that if this trend of wasting printing resources is not quickly reversed, the so-called "intellectual food" has the potential to experience a panic. In recent years, we rarely see important works and translations about social sciences, natural sciences, and literature and art being published. This is already a very obvious premonition!</p>
<p>A: I also share your dissatisfaction with the publishing industry. I also believe that if we do not change this trend of reprinting ancient books, it will be self-destruction for our country's publishing industry. But I am not defending bookstore owners just because I am a bookstore clerk. As far as I know, the formation of this trend of reprinting ancient books is also a forced situation, with its own objective reasons.</p>
<p>B: Bookstore owners have objective reasons for reprinting ancient books, that's a very clever defense! I believe that bookstore owners should not be solely profit-oriented, but should prioritize culture. Publishing more reading materials suitable for knowledge-seeking youth can promote culture. After promoting culture, they can expand the sales of their publications. I want to advise bookstore owners to broaden their horizons a little, and not just focus on the wallets of those who have idle money to buy their large collections, and spend printing resources for them, putting those poor young people with a strong desire for knowledge aside, and ignoring them. You must know that the objective situation is that those who have idle money to buy large collections of books buy the books but don't read them, they just put them aside as decorations. Poor young people with a strong desire for knowledge read a few books they need as seriously as if they were eating a meal. Ignoring this very noteworthy objective situation, and promoting the objective reasons for reprinting ancient books, I never thought that after a few years, you have been trained to be a standard bookstore employee, congratulations, congratulations! Haha, friends are too familiar, and we start arguing as soon as we meet, I apologize, I apologize, please don't be offended!</p>
<p>A: You are speaking with feeling, and I have already stated that I share your sentiments. It's just that you like to interrupt, old friends know each other well, what is there to be offended about? But without asking clearly what the reasons are, you develop another kind of objective fact. This is an attitude that we should not have in discussing problems.</p>
<p>B: That's my fault, I'm sorry, may I ask what are the objective reasons for bookstore owners reprinting ancient books?</p>
<p>A: What objective reasons, it's very simple to say. It's just that after listening to your discussion just now, I feel that there is a concept that is not very correct and should be abandoned, otherwise you will listen to what I say and think that I am arguing strongly, and interrupt again, and not grasp the core of this issue.</p>
<p>B: Please enlighten me.</p>
<p>A: I wouldn't dare! You said that bookstore owners should not be solely profit-oriented, but should prioritize culture. I feel that this concept of yours is not very correct.</p>
<p>B: Forgive my interruption. Do you mean that bookstore owners should be solely profit-oriented and don't need to prioritize culture? This is a great defense for bookstore owners!</p>
<p>A: I am not defending bookstore owners, nor do I need to defend them. What I mean is this: if you hope that bookstore owners will not be solely profit-oriented, but will focus solely on culture, that is an incorrect concept. I am not saying that bookstore owners only need to be profit-oriented and don't need to care about culture. But, if they only care about culture and completely disregard profit or loss, then it is definitely not a bookstore. This is the same principle as my friend not being able to serve society on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>B: I still don't quite understand, please explain it further. I always feel that you are defending bookstore owners.</p>
<p>A: That's right, on the point of your excessive criticism of bookstore owners, I do have some intention of defending bookstore owners. But rather than saying that I am defending bookstore owners, it is better to say that I am advising you not to excessively elevate the status of bookstore owners. Bookstore owners are merchants, how can you teach a merchant to abandon commercial behavior and take culture as the sole purpose!</p>
<p>B: Then what exactly is the so-called objective reason for bookstore owners to reprint ancient books?</p>
<p>A: To know the objective reason for reprinting ancient books, you must first know the objective reason for printing fewer new books. First, the source of new books depends on the supply of authors. In today's China, there are only a few authors who can be counted, and the number of words they write is limited. Moreover, because the sales of books are not wide and the prices are low, bookstores cannot afford high royalties. People with a little bit of ability would rather engage in political activities, who would be willing to bury themselves in writing, waiting for royalties to buy rice to cook. As a result, there are fewer and fewer authors. As for old books, because authors over thousands of years have written a lot for them, and they don't need to pay royalties, they can take whatever they want. If you were a bookstore owner, please think, is it more convenient to print new books or old books?</p>
<p>B: What about the second reason?</p>
<p>A: The second reason is? The government's publishing law is very strict about the publication of new books, and there is always the danger of being prohibited from distribution or being punished. Moreover, books that have been prohibited from distribution or punished often have better sales and higher royalties. Bookstores have suffered a few losses, so they naturally don't dare to print new books boldly. It is better to print old books, which can be free and unrestricted, and not subject to the publishing law.</p>
<p>B: Is there a third reason?</p>
<p>A: The third reason is that although China's copyright law has been in effect for many years, its actual effect seems to be very weak. If a new book is published and the sales are good, reprint merchants will immediately reprint it for you, competing with the original book with extremely low prices. Buyers only know to buy cheap, and don't care about reprinting. As for new books with poor sales, bookstores may only lose money. Therefore, the publication of new books is also greatly hit.</p>
<p>B: This cannot be considered a reason, it's still the bookstores' fault for seeking huge profits. If their prices were as cheap as the reprints, who would want to reprint?</p>
<p>A: You are still a scholar after all, and you don't understand the situation in the business world. How can publishers compete with reprint merchants? First, reprint merchants don't have to pay any royalties or proofreading fees; second, these people are small organizations and don't need the large expenses of publishers; so one can set a price of one yuan, which is just enough to cover the cost, while the other can earn money by setting a price of fifty cents. As for reprinting old books, as long as the price is low and the sales are high, there is no need for royalties and other expenses, so of course it can be more profitable than new books.</p>
<p>B: Is there a fourth reason?</p>
<p>A: The fourth reason can be said to be the most important reason. Do you understand the law of supply and demand in economics? If there is no certain need in society, of course there will be no certain supply; supply originally arises from need. China's current ideological world seems to be separated by generations compared to the May Fourth Movement. More active elements often encounter danger. On the one hand, the political authorities advocate reading the classics and respecting the sages; on the other hand, scholars are promoting the leisurely literature of the late Ming Dynasty. More fearful readers are happy to delve into the piles of old books to entrust their feelings, avoid disasters and avoid misfortune, this is one need. Also, the economic panic makes people who want to read books unable to afford books; in order to temporarily fill the intellectual hunger, cheap old books therefore take advantage of the opportunity. This is the second need. These are all extremely serious problems, and cannot be completely blamed on the profit-seeking of bookstore owners.</p>
<p>B: After listening to what you said, although I have to admit that you have a reason, I still feel that it is not reassuring to allow this unreasonable reality to exist and develop. Do you really have no way to correct it?</p>
<p>A: It is probably impossible for the responsibility of correction to rely entirely on bookstore owners. The movement of thought, the revitalization of the market, these are beyond what a small number of people can do. As far as our own strength allows, we can only, within the possible scope, when publishing more new books, try our best to conduct strict selection and careful sorting, so that it can be used for the material of the current academic circles, and not open the car of the era, and help people in the retro movement to push the waves, that is considered to be the responsibility we should do.</p>
<h3>How I Traveled Around the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhonghua</p>
<p>Written before "Pacific Pilgrimage"</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the urgency of the situation in the Far East, we have paid special attention to everything in the Pacific Ocean. The crisis in the Far East has stirred up the winds and clouds over the Pacific Ocean, and the winds and clouds over the Pacific Ocean have further increased the crisis in the Far East: these two are interconnected. Around the Pacific Ocean, there are many powerful forces and small nations, all of which have been deeply affected by the Far East issue—specifically, the China issue. The strong seek to expand their power, carrying out unbridled plunder on the four shores of the Pacific Ocean and on the sea; the weak are subjected to abuse, some are deprived of their vitality, and some are struggling to survive. As a result, various changes on the Pacific Ocean have unfolded rapidly: old cities have been built into new ones, small harbors have been converted into huge military stations, and many small islands that have been neglected in the past have been taken over for use as naval bases or fuel stations, while the maneuvering and combat of warships and aircraft have broken the silence on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>All of this has aroused our infinite attention. I personally often think that Chinese people should open their eyes wider, look farther, and see what's going on with all these changes outside. We cannot wait to die in closed-door silence, but should seek survival in the midst of great changes!</p>
<p>Therefore, I planned to travel around the four shores of the Pacific Ocean, to observe everything more concretely.</p>
<p>But, what power do I rely on to start this trip? I can't raise the huge travel expenses. There are also various political, economic, cultural, and even transportation barriers between the ports around the Pacific Ocean, so this trip is not easy. This made me have to turn to other thoughts in the reverie of this vast ocean surface. In any case, I want to travel according to my fantasy. Finally, I decided: to use the map as a compass, to use books as ships and vehicles in the journey, and to use newspapers and magazines as food along the way.</p>
<p>In this way, after a considerable period of preparation, I began this systematic trip. Along the way, I wrote down the impressions of this pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Regarding the impressions of this pilgrimage, I also spent considerable effort in arranging them. I want to make it like a completely real travelogue, but I don't want it to become that kind of travelogue that simply writes about the scenery and trivial matters along the way. I have set a general outline plan, and write according to this plan.</p>
<p>I draw a map of every place I have been to; not a detailed map of this place, but a simple map of the terrain of this place on the Pacific coast. For example, the map I drew of Shanghai is to illustrate that it is the "gateway to China"; Vladivostok I want to illustrate that it is the "front line of Soviet Far East defense"; the Panama Canal, on the map shows that it is the "bridge between the two oceans"; the Hawaiian Islands, its position and situation is just like "Gibraltar in the Pacific". In addition to these partial maps, I also prepared two maps of the entire Pacific Ocean, showing the spheres of influence of the great powers in the Pacific Ocean and the distances between the key points.</p>
<p>I hope this narrative is not only a cross-section, but also a longitudinal section. Therefore, I also write about the development of the imperialist forces in the Pacific Ocean, the plundering of the lands of small nations, how each port or military base has gone through many struggles and twists and turns, and finally fallen into the hands of a certain country, and been "developed" and "constructed". Their historical background. I think that this can not only help everyone understand the situation in various places along the Pacific coast, but also point out the trend of political evolution in the Pacific Ocean, and give us some historical lessons.</p>
<p>In addition, what I pay attention to naturally are the ethnic life, economic struggles, especially the military deployments in various places. Regarding these, I tried my best to use recent newspaper and magazine materials. The sharp disputes in the Pacific coast caused by the drastic changes in the Far East in the past four or five years are really very different from many years ago. Every year, every month, every day, is developing and changing, and the old historical and geographical records are not enough. We must record these new historical and geographical materials as soon as possible. This realistic knowledge can increase our understanding of the current international situation, promote the awakening of our nation, and strengthen our ability to cope with the extremely critical situation.</p>
<p>I started this trip in early 1935 and ended in mid-1936: this period was the time when the Pacific Ocean, especially our China, was changing the most drastically. The Washington Treaty has been torn up, the arms race of imperialism has been carried out openly, and the imminent misfortune of small nations has become even more serious; in China, the division of North China has in fact been completed, and the division of South China is also gradually becoming apparent. How can our nation survive in this era of imperialism showing its teeth and claws? I would like to use the publication of this small booklet to arouse the sudden awakening of the people of the country!</p>
<h3>Introducing "Robinson Crusoe"</h3>
<p>— Yu Huiren</p>
<p>American educator Mr. Smith said in Progressive Education: "Undoubtedly, dear parents, now you and I are continuing the life of the world, shouldering the burden of culture, and those great plans and detailed facilities for the operation and control of nature will soon decline and disappear with the passage of years. What continues to exist and be active after us are only the children of today."</p>
<p>"Children are the mothers of the future." One of our responsibilities is to cultivate talents for future generations, consider the happiness of our descendants, and train them so that they can bravely and intelligently deal with various public and private issues in the future, selflessly sacrifice the small self, and successfully establish a career with integrity. But to obtain this kind of character, we must let children receive perfect education as soon as possible. Although there are many kinds of perfect education, education that provides sufficient and appropriate children's reading materials is indeed one of them. Why? Because children's reading materials are "food for the spirit of children." It has the power of many elements that can inspire and cultivate the minds of children.</p>
<p>The habit most related to success and joy in children's habits is the habit of reading. It is very obvious that the lack of reading habits not only limits the knowledge he deserves, but also hinders the development of his abilities.</p>
<p>In this sense, the publication of children's reading materials in our country has been very prosperous recently, which is really a gratifying phenomenon. But what we regret is that there are very few of these children's swirls that can benefit people. Most of them ignore the psychology of children, and just indifferently put out a few copies. Therefore, emperors, princesses, gods and monsters, and distorted consciousness are almost all. If these readings are taken as "food for the spirit of children," then the future of our culture and nation will definitely be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Children are active operators of flexible hearts. From this meaning, I introduced Robinson Crusoe as "spiritual food" for children, which must be liked by many people; but perhaps some people think that this is an old work (a product of the eighteenth century), like wearing old clothes, without new beauty, nor new pleasure, and not worth introducing.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe is a world-famous children's reading material, the seventh book most loved by boys. The content tells about a man named Robinson who encountered danger on a sea voyage and drifted to a deserted island. On the deserted island, he fully exerted his human intelligence and did a kind of career similar to our society. He lived on this deserted island for more than twenty-eight years. In this long time, he fully demonstrated the temperament of a hero. Although the story is fictitious by novelists, the description is very close to reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the translations of Robinson Crusoe, there are already several kinds in our country, there are four or five kinds. What I want to introduce now is the abridged translation by Mr. Gu Junzheng and Tang Xiguang. Why do I want to introduce this translation, and not introduce other translations? I think it is different from other translations in the following points:</p>
<p>First, it did not completely transplant the religious thoughts of "thanking God the Holy Spirit" and "thanking God for his mercy" into the minds of children. The religious meaning in Robinson Crusoe is very strong. Robinson's every move, as well as the success or failure of a career, he must thank God's mercy and pray for God's pity. As a literary book of children's reading materials as "food for the spirit of children", it is not only necessary to estimate its literary value, but also to estimate its educational value. The value of religious thought in education is known to those with knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, although it is an abridged translation, it does not omit the important descriptions in the book, leaving only a series of plots; in other words, it does not change this novel into a story, but still gives it the original appearance of the novel. There are already four or five kinds of Robinson Crusoe translations in our country, some are fully translated according to the original text, and some are based on the facts of the original text and interpreted as stories, losing the essence of the original work. Gu Tang's abridged translation is based on educational principles and children's psychology, and eliminates the parts that are not suitable for children one by one, making it a very educational thing. The text in the book still retains the spirit of Defoe's original work.</p>
<p>Third, it sorts out a clear chapter sequence from the complex narrative, and each chapter has an essential title, which is easy to remember and easy to find.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is accompanied by more than sixty beautiful illustrations, the arrangement of the pictures, and the expression of the characters, are enough to supplement the meaning that is not exhausted in the book, although this is an additional issue, but it still occupies a very important position in the current children's reading materials in our country.</p>
<p>Although Robinson Crusoe is an old work, it is still rich in nourishment and benefits people, and this abridged version has completed its educational value; I hope that readers will appreciate this feature while cherishing the mood of cultivating broad knowledge and noble sentiments, and read this book. I think your knowledge will be wider and deeper, and your spirit will be tempered.</p>
<p>Special Item</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Interpretation of Copyright Law Issues</h3>
<p>Judicial Yuan Letter No. 1449 of the 25th Year</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>(1) The government's designation of historical works as official histories does not affect the original author's copyright. (2) Copyright is not a right exclusively belonging to the author; if the author's published works during their lifetime were not registered, their heirs may apply for registration if the statutory time limit has not expired.</p>
<p>(3) The Implementing Regulations of the Copyright Law state that an author voluntarily allows others to reprint or imitate; this expression of intent does not require a specific form and is not limited to explicit statements.</p>
<p>Reference Laws</p>
<p>(1) Article 1 of the Copyright Law: The following works, upon registration in accordance with this law, shall have exclusive rights to reproduction and shall be subject to copyright:</p>
<p>1. Books, treatises, and novels. (Omitted remainder).</p>
<p>(2) Article 3 of the Copyright Law: Copyright may be transferred to others.</p>
<p>Article 4 of the same law: Copyright belongs to the author for their lifetime; and may be continued by the author's heirs for thirty years after the author's death.</p>
<p>However, this does not apply if there are other provisions.</p>
<p>(3) Article 1 of the Implementing Regulations of the Copyright Law: The following works shall not be eligible for registration under this law:</p>
<p>1. Those that have been circulating for twenty years without registration.</p>
<p>2. Those that the author voluntarily allows others to reprint or imitate.</p>
<p>Judicial Yuan Reply to the Ministry of Interior Official Letter, March 6th</p>
<p>In direct reply, after reviewing the Ministry's official letter of March 7th (No. 3902) addressed to the Supreme Court requesting interpretation of issues related to the Copyright Law, the Judicial Yuan's unified interpretation of laws and regulations conference has resolved: (1) The government's explicit decree designating historical works as official histories to facilitate wider dissemination does not affect the original author's copyright. (2) Copyright is not a right exclusively belonging to the author; this is clearly stated in Article 4 of the Copyright Law. If the author published works during their lifetime but did not register them, their heirs may apply for registration if the time limit stipulated in Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations of the Copyright Law has not expired. (3) The Implementing Regulations of the Copyright Law, Article 1, Section 2, state that an author voluntarily allows others to reprint or imitate; this expression of intent does not require a specific form and is not limited to explicit statements. If all circumstances lead to the inference that the author intended to allow anyone to reprint or imitate, it conforms to the provisions of that section. However, the mere fact of allowing a specific person to reprint or imitate is difficult to infer as intending to allow anyone to reprint or imitate. This reply is accordingly sent to your ministry for your information.</p>
<p>Attached: Ministry of Interior Official Letter to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Regarding the questions of doubt raised in relation to the Copyright Law, they are listed separately below:</p>
<p>(1) If a historical work has been explicitly designated by the government as an official history for broad dissemination, does the original author still have copyright?</p>
<p>(2) Article 6 of the Copyright Law stipulates that works published after the author's death are entitled to copyright for thirty years. If the author published the work during their lifetime but did not register it according to the law, can the author's heirs apply for registration after the author's death?</p>
<p>(3) Article 1, Section 2 of the Implementing Regulations of the Copyright Law states: "Authors who voluntarily allow others to reprint or imitate." Does this require any formal, explicit procedures?</p>
<p>The above three points of doubt are not explicitly stipulated in the law, and handling them is particularly doubtful. In accordance with Article 4, Section 2 of the Rules on Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations and Changes in Publications of the Judicial Yuan, a corresponding letter is sent for your review and a swift interpretation is requested in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Last year, Kaiming Bookstore published the Twenty-Five Histories, adding Ke Shaomin's "New History of Yuan," which had been designated as an official history by the government, to the existing Twenty-Four Histories to create a complete history. They also entered into a contract with Ke's heirs to obtain publishing rights. Soon after, Tan Tian, ​​under the fictitious name of "Book and Newspaper Cooperative," published advertisements to sell a so-called "Twenty-Six Histories" pre-order and simultaneously planned to reprint "New History of Yuan." Ke's heirs, relying on the registration certificate from the Ministry of Interior, sued Tan Tian in the Shanghai First Special District District Court for infringing on copyright, and the court ruled to prohibit reprinting. Tan Tian then claimed that since the book had been designated as an official history by the Ministry, Ke should not enjoy copyright, and pointed out that it had been published by Xu's Tuigengtang as the author voluntarily allowing others to reprint, and requested the Ministry of Interior to revoke the book's registration. The Ministry of Interior, listing the doubts, sent a letter to the Supreme Court for interpretation. Now, the Judicial Yuan's unified interpretation of laws and regulations conference has resolved the interpretation as above. This proves that the "New History of Yuan" legally has copyright and cannot be infringed upon. During the litigation, some considered Tan Tian's reasoning to be legitimate and sympathized with him. Now, Tan Tian has fled after embezzling the pre-order money and has been charged with fraud, and the court has issued an arrest warrant. The general public can now understand the truth of this matter.</p>

London spot gold rose 3 pence. Over-the-counter pre-market trading opened at 41 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, Yongchun, and Yuanyong sold immediately, falling to 38 yuan, largely due to reports stating that the content of the Sino-US monetary agreement had not yet been announced, and that the exchange of silver was still some time away, causing floating longs to waver.

<h3>Chinese Merchants Make Slight Sales, Foreign Exchange Rates Ease Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market turned tired, lacking support. Banks sold slightly, resulting in a hard reversion. Initially, the overseas silver market saw London spot and forward contracts both rise by 125. Players claimed that after the market closed, the market was firm, with India buying in and China selling out, with transactions above the listed price of 125. It was rumored that the United States would purchase a large amount from China. New York silver prices rose by half a cent, and Montagu forward silver prices rose between 3.5 and 6 .

At this time, banks traded against each other, with a hovering process. After entering, Sassoon and others bought in, but unfortunately, the bank's selling appetite was strong, and there was still no improvement. However, due to rumors that 700,000 ounces of silver would be exported before June, market confidence remained weak, and there was a flow of sales in the afternoon market. Indian silver was reported to have increased by 6 annas, but because banks came to pull the price, it had little effect. The situation was flat. The closing selling prices were spot prices of 1 shilling, 2 pence, 375 and 4375 for the British pound, and 29.75 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was 0.03125, and the US dollar eased 0.0625. Chinese merchants slightly sold off, and bank matching was quite tight. The daily transaction prices are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Securities: Major Longs Emerge in Droves, Government Bonds Experience a Sudden Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange experienced an unexpected decline, in inverse proportion to Wednesday's unexpected rise. Increased troops in North China and other rumors arose, but the reason for the market price fluctuation was the emergence of Contract No. 35 longs. This caused selling pressure to increase further. If Contracts No. 11 and No. 72 had not bought in large quantities, the decline would have been even more severe. The situation was dire, and the easy rush was due to the time of raising prices. Although the rumors cannot be confirmed, even if they are untrue, the market price cannot easily turn to rise due to the slight firmness of the close. It is difficult to be optimistic for the time being. Yesterday's performance saw flatness and fatigue in the two morning sessions, showing signs of weakness. Contract No. 35 slowly emerged, and Nos. 4, 34, and 37 all sold off. Although there were buy-ins from Nos. 11, 32, and 48, the majority of Contract No. 35 longs had a cautious attitude. Therefore, the two sessions gradually declined, already losing between 3-5 and 6 corners. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose, and the opening situation was quite serious. The strongest selling sentiment came from Contract No. 35, and others such as Nos. 4, 23, and 37 also sold off extremely enthusiastically. The entire market relied on the brave buying of Nos. 11 and 72 to provide some support. However, it had already fallen by 3-5 corners to 7.5 corners. At the close, retail investors slightly compensated, and Nos. 34 and 77 slightly bought in, while Nos. 3, 16, and 37 were still selling. Although the market price had recovered slightly by 2-3 corners, it was a temporary small recovery and should not be considered a trend reversal. As a result, the market price was down by 5.5 to 8.5 corners, and 96 was also down by 1-2 corners. The total transaction volume was 7,275,000 yuan, with the third session being the most active. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table below. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Frenzy, Many Turbulences in the Yarn Market, Increasing Chips...Larger Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn market has been rising and falling suddenly, and the upward momentum is extremely violent, making it difficult to grasp. The momentum is unusually fierce, making it feel quite formidable. The market's enthusiasm has reached a boiling point. General speculators are restless, and the number of chips is increasing, so the waves are large. The previous market's rise was still strong. In the afternoon, news of securities falling circulated, causing the market price to decline, followed by short covering and then leveling off.</p>
<p>Dachangcheng Takes in at Market Price in the Morning</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the selling party increased due to the news of some long positions, and the market price fell by 8.9 corners to 1.5-6 yuan. After the second session, discussions about the Sino-US monetary agreement were in full swing, with different people seeing different things. Buying sentiment rose again, and the market price rose slowly. Until the third close, Dachangcheng suddenly came to take in at market price, with a very large amount, reaching beyond 10,000 bales. Thus, the trading floor felt dry again, but Hexing's offering was also huge. The market price jumped wildly by 1.9 corners to 8.9 corners. The closing price of the near month contract rose by 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far month contract rose by 2.5-7 corners. The market opened in the afternoon with the near month contract suddenly falling by 7-8 corners to 1 yuan. The market situation changed at the second opening. Rumors were abundant, government bonds fell, and selling sentiment was extremely strong. The market situation took a sharp turn for the worse. However, Dachangcheng continued to absorb, with each month falling by more than 1 yuan. Until the third close, some short positions covered, and the road market rose back by more than 1 yuan. However, when the October contract was auctioned, it fell by 2 corners again. As a result, each month fell by 6-8-9 corners to 1 yuan compared to the morning close. However, this month's price remained unchanged. The selling parties were Deda at 1,150 bales, Juxing at 2,000 bales, Yukang at 650 bales, Daji at 2,750 bales, Hexing at 8,600 bales, Gengfeng at 2,200 bales, Yuan at 2,000 bales, Changfeng at 2,400 bales, Runkang at 2,100 bales, Shengyuan at 2,300 bales, Jinghua at 1,350 bales, Mingde at 1,100 bales, Renfeng at 1,000 bales, Yicheng at 1,050 bales, and Tonghe at 1,900 bales. The buying parties were Dafu at 2,600 bales, Tongji at 1,850 bales, Yuda at 2,300 bales, Shenchang at 2,700 bales, Shenji at 2,500 bales, Jinchang at 2,000 bales, and Xincheng at 2,350 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Still Exceed 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>The current yarn sales can still be maintained. It has been found that all gangs bought a total of 1,185 bales throughout the day. The selling price was average. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3>Rumors Control Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell, and the situation was extremely complicated. At the beginning of the morning, buyers gathered and supported the market due to the issue of the Sino-US monetary agreement. The saying that long positions were receiving goods in the near month was extremely prevalent, and the far month contract was brought up. In the afternoon, due to unfavorable rumors, it turned downward. In three days, it has already risen by more than 2 yuan compared to the low price, and there may be a rebound.</p>
<p>Mingde and Hexing Spit Out in Large Quantities</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, some long positions were spitting out, so the number of market followers selling exceeded two or three times. Each month fell by 2-3-4 corners. The form was relatively weak. However, after entering, the good yarn market and favorable rumors revived, and many long positions prepared to receive goods this month, preparing to ship them to other places for sales. Therefore, buying sentiment was strong, and the market price gradually opened and supported. However, Mingde Hexing frantically spat out, resulting in the near month contract rising by four corners compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far month contract rising by five points to one corner. The market opened in the afternoon, rumors revived, and it was said that Reuters had denied the Sino-US monetary issue. Therefore, selling sentiment suddenly rose, and the market turned sharply downward, with each month falling by 3.5 to 5 corners. It was found that Juxing sold 3,000 dan, Deda sold 1,700 dan, Yukang sold 3,500 dan, Mingde sold 12,500 dan, Hexing sold 8,600 dan, Yicheng sold 5,800 dan, Yichang sold 2,300 dan, Da Chang sold 2,900 dan, Dafeng sold 2,300 dan, Gengfeng sold 1,600 dan, Changhe sold 4,500 dan, Chengji sold 1,300 dan, and Taichang sold 1,400 dan. Yuda bought 4,000 dan, Shenchang bought 6,800 dan, Ruida bought 2,400 dan, Shenji bought 5,300 dan, Renfeng bought 1,600 dan, Taichang bought 2,700 dan, Changfeng bought 4,900 dan, Shengyuan bought 7,300 dan, Yongda bought 2,800 dan, Yikang bought 7,100 dan, Xinchang bought 2,700 dan, Xincheng bought 3,500 dan, and Runkang bought 2,200 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Local Cotton: Very Active</p>
<p>The current consumption of cotton is still quite substantial, and the factory stomach is still healthy. The source is 200 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>American wheat, the crop conditions here and in Canada are both excellent. People are bearish on the market, fearing that it can only rebound to a high and there is no hope of a major rise.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Prices Rise Uniformly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with good news from Liverpool. The Smith Act was passed, the weather continued to be good, and consumption increased. Each month rose by one to seven pounds. Subsequently, the stock market was strong, and foreign firms actively bought the near month contract, especially October. Wall Street also bought, so the amount of short selling was absorbed. The cotton hoarding brokers sold 10,000 bales of the April contract, and the May contract was also sold at 1.16 cents. Finally, Wall Street bought again, and the market price rose again. Spot prices rose by three pounds, and futures prices rose by three to sixteen pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by four points, and futures prices rose by three to seven points. Indian cotton was firm due to the passage of the US cotton Smith Act and the strong stock market, with speculators and European exporters buying. Pingguoer rose by 1.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.5 to 2.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.5 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (14th dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai dispatch, the opening forecast for the July-August contract of Bailuoxi cotton on the 15th was 202 rupees, up 1.75 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Three Products of Yarn and Cotton all Rise</h3>
<p>Osaka dispatch on the 15th, three-product yarn futures rose by 4 corners to 1 yuan and 4 corners. The near month contract was 196 yuan, and the far month contract was 196 yuan and 4 corners. Cotton futures rose by 2 corners to 6 corners. The near month contract was 64 yuan, and the far month contract was 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Improve, Market Relatively Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market was driven by speculation in raw cotton and yarn. Industry insiders, seeing that the Sino-American monetary agreement was nearly concluded and that cotton cloth prices were likely to rise significantly, were also concerned about the shrinking sales of cotton cloth. Therefore, the buying interest was not very strong. Yesterday, the market was firm, and sales were quite good. The Yantai and Qingdao merchants purchased more than 300 pieces of 16-pound, three-star coarse cloth from Dasheng Factory. Color goods were purchased from Dafeng Factory's "Four Happiness" brand, Guangzhong Factory's "Consort Xiang" brand, Gongsheng Factory's "Popular" brand, and Qingfeng Factory's "Qingfeng" logo. More than 30 cases of plain crepe were the most popular. Other goods included standard colored cloth from Hui Yucheng New Factory and Hongzhang Guang Shuangfeng crepe de chine, totaling more than 10 pieces. Japanese merchants offered 100 pieces of 11-pound blue Japanese fine cloth for this month's delivery, and the price increased by 2.5 cents. Major merchants from Guangdong-Hankou and Pingjin showed little interest.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Transactions are Few, and Foreign Firms' Sales Halt Again</h3>
<p>The local silk market was quite firm at the beginning of the month, with substantial sales to Europe and America. However, in less than ten days, due to the sudden depreciation of the French franc and the drop in Japanese silk prices, the foreign firms' silk market halted again. Yesterday, New York raw silk rose slightly, Yokohama continued to fall, and Lyon silk prices were sluggish. The Shanghai silk market was still struggling to improve, and the user silk market was also quiet. Yesterday, it was only heard that a user from the interior purchased five bales of coarse strip white factory B-grade silk at a price of 690 yuan.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Sold by Tender Again Yesterday, Purchased Exclusively by Xingchang at a Price of Over 310 Yuan</h3>
<p>The artificial silk (totaling 35,641.59 pounds, equivalent to more than 178 cases) sold by tender by the local Jianghai Customs opened for bidding at 10:00 AM yesterday. Due to fierce competition from all parties, the bid price was exceptionally high. As a result, it was purchased exclusively by Xingchang in Shanghai at a price of over 310 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of No. 120 Tianqiao brand smuggled goods remained unchanged at just over 300 yuan, with more than ten cases sold. Dull silk sales were still good. No. 75 and No. 100 were out of stock. Japanese dull silk had a dull color and uneven dyeing, so its sales were not as good as European goods.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Market Suddenly Turns Quiet</h3>
<p>My country's green tea trade with foreign countries, especially French Morocco, has been substantial. Recently, rumors of a devaluation of the French franc have made British and French tea merchants in this area feel uneasy, and the idea of rushing to buy new goods has been thwarted, and the market has suddenly become quiet. Although 700 to 800 boxes of Luzhuang Sui'an Zhenmei green tea have been successively transported to various tea warehouses yesterday, European firms have shown very little interest, and the market situation is particularly noteworthy. Only the core-drawn goods of local Zhen tea have seen some scattered sales, and wholesale transactions have also become sparse. The market price continued to fall by 3-4 yuan, and the situation is quite unfavorable.</p>
<h3>Qimen Black Tea Over 1,000 Boxes Arrive</h3>
<p>Over the past two days, new Qimen black tea has been successively transported to Shanghai, with more than 1,000 boxes. It is said that a large batch will arrive within the next few days, and new samples will be promoted in the next issue.</p>
<h3>Huzhou New Tea is Selling Well, Price is 10 Yuan Higher Than Last Year</h3>
<p>When this year's new Huzhou green tea was launched in the production area, it coincided with good sales of Gaozhuang goods after the opening of the new tea market in Shanghai. As a result, sales were brisk, and the selling price increased to 50 yuan outside the customs, which was 10 yuan higher than last year. Recently, tea factories such as Fuchanglong Gongsheng have transported large quantities to Shanghai and will start production immediately.</p>
<h3>A New Tea Trading Firm Opens</h3>
<p>Recently, a Danish merchant opened a new trading firm called Yilong Trading Firm on the floor above the Fushi Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road, specializing in tea leaves from various regions. All tea warehouses have been notified to submit samples.</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour Market Looks Weak in Sunny Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month showed a trend of first stabilizing and then weakening. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago Canada and the United States, was only 4 cents better, or a small amount of 10 cents. At the time of the opening price, the trend for June was still stable due to the competition between bulls and bears. However, starting in July, the market atmosphere was consistently unstable due to the poor weather and pessimistic sentiment. Moreover, the flour factories continued to sell off their holdings, so the market atmosphere gradually relaxed. The market also rumored that a problem had occurred at the Tianjin Customs, and the future sales of Shanghai flour would inevitably be further affected. Therefore, the sellers seemed to regain the upper hand. By the time of the market closing in the afternoon, transactions for each month had become light. Although the market atmosphere continued to be sluggish, the degree of decline had decreased because if the flour factories increase their selling, the market will inevitably decline; otherwise, the weakness will not be seen.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat: Inland Merchants Continue Selling Off, Market Price Falls Back 8-9 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was weak across the board after the opening of trading in the morning. This was because the weather had turned favorable, and reports from all regions indicated that the new wheat crop had not been affected by the prolonged rain. In addition, the flour market was unable to stabilize due to factory sales, so the prices for all months immediately fell by 3-5 cents. As inland merchants also gradually sold off their holdings, the market conditions were no longer as quiet as before. By the afternoon opening, there were not many transactions for June, and the price continued to weaken. July and later months fell by another 3-4 cents due to the sluggish flour market. If the sunny weather continues, the market is expected to weaken further. Currently, most flour factories are still taking a wait-and-see approach to the wheat market. High-quality goods were offered at 4.70 yuan in the South City, with only 300-400 bags being transacted.</p>
<h3>Local Indica Rice Still Sold Locally, Although Foreign Rice Arrivals and Inventories are Scarce, Market Prices are Also Softened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of local indica rice was not strong, but the inventories held by merchants and customers were sufficient. As the weather became gradually warmer, it could not be stored for long, so everyone was competing to sell. Those with medium or lower quality were even willing to lower prices to sell off their stock. Therefore, the prices of various types of rice in the market continued to fall slightly by 3-5 cents. Although the arrivals and inventories of foreign rice were small, the market prices were also softened by the local indica rice. Sales were still mainly local, with slight demand from merchants from the interior. Throughout the day, 2,600 bags of Jiangxi rice, 300 bags of Hunan rice, 885 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, and 100 bags of small polished rice were transacted. The market outlook is weak. It is necessary to have local customers purchase in bulk to stabilize the market; otherwise, there is still a need for gradual price reductions because most local indica rice cannot be stored after the weather becomes hot.</p>
<h3>White Japonica Rice Sales Move Slightly in Retail Shops</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various merchants only arrived at more than ten houses, with a total of nearly 4,000 dan (a unit of dry measure). Among them, there were more early indica rice varieties. The sales volume in the main area of the street remained stagnant, with Dalian merchants dealing in more than 1,000 bags of early indica rice varieties. Therefore, the market for thick early japonica rice continued to be slightly worse off. Early indica rice varieties did not experience large changes. Du Yangjian prices were slightly soft. The price of Yinbian Yuan was average.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were 23-24 sources of supplies from various areas of Hexia. Among the various sales channels in the market, the retail sales of white japonica rice in shops moved slightly. The market situation was calm. The dismantling of early indica rice in the stacks was normal, and the price showed a slightly softer trend. The retail sales of Yinbian Yuan was stagnant, and the price was slightly near an angle. The prices of Yangdu, Kejian, and other goods were peaceful.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Sesame Seeds Remain Unsold and Continue to Fall, Only Scattered Transactions in Yellow Soybeans</h3>
<p>Due to the weak overseas situation, transactions in foreign firms' sesame seeds have been quiet for a long time, and the market conditions are moving downstream. Yesterday, an English firm sold 150 tons at a price of 12.40 yuan, a decrease of 6 cents compared to the previous market price. The future trend is still weak. There were only scattered sales of yellow soybeans in the sales channels of local merchants and the main street. The market price was stable without significant changes. A total of more than 3,000 bags of various soybean types were traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: More Transactions in Guangdong Coarse White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 1,200 bags of Five Rams Coarse White Sugar were sold.</p>
<p>The sugar market trend was calm yesterday, and sales showed slight activity. Therefore, sales of Guangdong sugars increased. The combined company's total quota of Guangdong coarse white sugar and other types of sugar yesterday was 5,541 bags. 1,230 bags of Five Rams coarse white sugar produced by Shunde Factory were sold at 21.80 yuan, 20 bags from Quxi Factory were sold at 21.60 yuan, and 30 bags of No. 2 Five Rams fine white sugar were sold at 20.80 yuan. The remaining No. 4 fine white sugar and medium-grade white sugar were not sold.</p>
<p>The Guild's quoted price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 22 yuan for spot goods and 6.80 yuan for re-exports. The prices of Dongchibai and Zhenji Dahua Jinxin Chouben Factory's fine white sugar remained unchanged. However, the prices of Zhenyu products rose slightly. No. 1 was 20.60 yuan, No. 2 was 20.40 yuan, No. 3 was 20.10 yuan, No. 4 was 19.80 yuan, and No. 5 was 19.50 yuan. There was also a lack of continued offerings for the higher grades. The quoted price for standard Five Blessings White Rock Candy remained unchanged, but no transactions were made. The quoted prices for other brands of rock candy, such as Wangmao, Shiqiu Shuang*, Yuchun, and Peacock, were as before, with little demand.</p>

<h3>Travel and Telegraphs</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>"In the late spring months, the grasses grow long in the Jiangnan region. Flowers of every hue blossom and trees burst forth with verdant life. Countless orioles take to the air, their voices filling the breeze." At this time of harmonious skies, brilliant sun, melodic birdsong, and perfumed air, we should lose no time in partaking in revelry. Accompanied by two or three close companions, embark upon a tour of famous scenic spots, or participate in group events, sharing in the joys of sightseeing. The ancients who held torches and toured by night truly understood the essence of life.</p>
<p>But setting out on a journey, far from home and family, saying farewell to friends, inevitably brings a sense of concern. Upon reaching a destination, after observing noteworthy sights, it is crucial to report one's circumstances in a timely manner, to reassure loved ones. To overcome this difficulty, while postal delivery is convenient, it cannot compare to the speed of telegrams or long-distance telephone calls.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate travelers, has entrusted the China Travel Service to handle telegrams on its behalf. At train stations or ports where the Travel Service maintains reception services, travelers can submit their prepared telegrams for transmission. Furthermore, at railway stations where agreements exist with local telegraph bureaus for line connections, information transmission, or telephone communication, or where arrangements have been made for handling telegrams and telephone calls, travelers can send telegrams or make phone calls. On ocean liners or riverboats equipped with wireless radio stations that communicate with coastal radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, travelers can send telegrams while at sea. Therefore, even when far away, there is no need to suffer the pangs of "looking eastward towards one's homeland."</p>
<p>Those remaining at home who wish to communicate with travelers can send telegrams to known destinations or, if the destination is unknown but the itinerary is known, telegrams can still be sent. There are two types of telegrams for this purpose: forwarding telegrams and poste restante telegrams. To communicate with travelers at sea, one can inquire about the name of the vessel and contact the telegraph bureau to send a ship telegram or a telegram seeking a particular passenger on a specific ship.</p>
<p>In this era of convenient transportation, travelers who use telegraphs to report their itineraries and those remaining at home who use telegraphs to alleviate their loneliness can be called people who understand the times.</p>
<h3>Talking About Telegraph Rates</h3>
<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>1.  Domestic Telegraph Rates</p>
<p>The level of telegraph rates is closely related to the national economy. If the fees are too high, the economic strength of the general public will not be able to bear it. Not only will the telegraph business not be able to develop universally, but it will also violate the fundamental purpose of state-run enterprises to facilitate the public. If the fees are too low, the revenue of the telegraph service will be sharply reduced, which will not be enough to maintain the salaries of telegraph bureau employees and the expenses of telegraph equipment and materials. The current domestic telegraph rates in our country may be criticized for being too high, but in fact, they are much lower than the former system of inter-provincial progressive increases or the system of intra-provincial and inter-provincial rates. (According to the inter-provincial progressive increase system, the highest rate was 40 cents per word, and the inter-provincial rate under the intra-provincial and inter-provincial system was 16 cents or 14 cents per word, which were all higher than the current rate.) Moreover, the address and title of the addressee of Chinese and foreign language telegrams are now charged as three words if they are within 13 words, and secret messages are charged as four words if they are within 14 words. At the same time, the fees for Chinese and foreign language urgent telegrams have been changed to twice the normal fee. Compared to the past, when the name and address of the addressee of Chinese telegrams had to be charged by the word, and Chinese and foreign language urgent telegrams were charged three times the normal fee, it is estimated that each telegram can save about one yuan in fees. It can be said that the prices are cheap and cheap. Moreover, our country has a vast territory. The rate for telegrams sent from Shanghai to remote provinces and regions such as Xikang is still 10 cents per word. The distance is actually farther than from Shanghai to Nagasaki, Japan, while telegrams between Shanghai and Nagasaki cost 1.45 yuan per word. Comparing each other, which is cheaper and which is more expensive?</p>
<p>Telegrams sent from various places in the country to Hong Kong and Macau are also regarded as domestic telegrams, but in the process of their transmission, they must be transmitted through foreign telegraph lines (including land lines and submarine cables) or international wireless circuits, so they are all charged at a specific rate. This item price has been detailed in the appendix of the domestic telegram rate table, and I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>2.  International Telegraph Rates</p>
<p>The total price per word of international telegrams transmitted by wire or wireless telegraphy is composed of three items: (1) the domestic fee of the sending and receiving countries, (2) the transit fee of each country through whose territory, machinery, or lines the telegram passes, and (3) if the telegram is relayed by two wireless telegraph stations or by submarine cables, the relay fee or submarine cable relay fee of each station. Also, the price per word of international telegrams is calculated in gold francs, so the number of national currency prices in the international telegram rate table printed by our country is converted from gold francs according to the exchange rate. Therefore, the rise and fall of the gold franc exchange rate is also related to the price of international telegrams in our country. (After the exchange rate is stabilized, this level may not cause problems). In order to suit the facts, the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications must revise the international telegraph rates after a considerable period of time, so that the number of national currency of the international telegraph rates can be equal to the number of gold franc prices, and the settlement of telegraph fees with the other party will not be affected by the rise and fall of the gold franc exchange rate. Also, the formulation and change of international telegraph rates must be agreed upon by the sending and receiving parties before they can be implemented. No country can arbitrarily set or change international telegraph rates. Recently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and other groups requested the Ministry of Communications to reduce the telegraph rates between China and the United States, but the Ministry of Communications did not approve the request. The above reasons are one of them.</p>
<h3>Methods to Avoid Damaging Submarine Cables (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>(C) All ships must not approach, and fishing gear must not be lowered within a quarter of a nautical mile from the cable buoys. These buoys often have the mark "Telegraph" and a flag is hung on them.</p>
<p>(D) All fishing boats should keep the trawl net opening and Otter doors safe, and prevent sharp points or protrusions from colliding with or damaging the cable. Special attention should be paid to the following points when using Otter doors:</p>
<p>(a) The heads of the iron bolts inside the Otter doors must be rounded. (b) The screws can only be nailed to the outside of the door, and must not protrude. If there are protruding sharp corners, they should be removed.</p>
<p>(c) The bottom of the door should not be flat, but should curve forward.</p>
<p>(d) The gold of the boots at the bottom of the door must be smooth. The iron bolts (not referring to nails or hinges) struck by the boots should have a conical head.</p>
<p>(e) The boots should be struck on the edge of the front end of the front panel and must be tightly placed on the top of the iron bolts on the edge to prevent them from extending out.</p>
<p>(f) Two pairs of triangular round iron rods should be placed inside the door to tie the net rope. Do not replace it with an iron chain.</p>
<p>(g) When tying the Otter door or trawl head to the net rope and fishing net, please pay special attention. The iron on both sides of the hinge joint should be completely tied to the door or fishing net.</p>
<p>Methods to Detach an Anchor from a Submarine Cable</p>
<p>(A) When a steamship or sailing ship encounters an anchor that cannot be lifted freely, the ship must be lifted gently on the winch. If its external resistance gradually increases or it feels that the anchor is moving in the water between other objects, it can be determined that what is hooked is a submarine cable.

<h3>Explanation of Supplementary Measures for Calculating the Address and Name of the Addressee of Chinese Private Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>The supplementary measures for calculating the address and name of the addressee of Chinese private telegrams, which were recently stipulated by the Ministry of Communications and issued to the public, have been published in this publication. Because there are still doubts about the supplementary measures from the outside world, the Telegraph Administration Department has issued a letter to each telegraph bureau to explain and give examples as follows:</p>
<p>If there is a registered telegraph number or the address and name of the first addressee in place of the name and address of the addressee, and there is also the name and address of the addressee, for example:</p>
<p>(I) 6855 Nanjing to Zhang Qinian, No. (708), Zhongshan North Road (II) Wang Hongjun, No. (16), Hanjing Street, Hankou to Zhao Pengnian, No. 5, Dongting Street</p>
<p>The senders of the above examples already know the detailed address of the second addressee, so they should directly send a telegram to the second addressee. In fact, there is no need to have the first addressee forward it. If the sender must send the telegram to the first addressee for forwarding due to special circumstances and voluntarily writes it in the format of the above examples, all the words from the word "to" onwards shall be included in the text of the telegram and charged by the word to show the restriction.</p>
<p>For telegrams to someone at a certain place and forwarded to someone, for example, "Jin Zhonghua, No. 10, Guangxi Road, Qingdao, and forwarded to Zou Boping," the intention of the sender is to ask the first addressee to read the telegram and inform the second addressee, which is similar to the nature of a "distributed" telegram, so it should be changed to a "distributed" telegram. If the sender cannot send it as a "distributed" telegram because he does not know the address of the second addressee, all the words from the word "and" onwards shall be included in the text of the telegram and charged by the word.</p>
<p>In addition to the above examples, if the word "to" is used or the meaning of forwarding is actually contained even if the word "to" is not used, all the remaining names of the addressees can be included in the addressee's address, for example:</p>
<p>(1) 5877 = Manager Zhang =</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association to All Newspaper Offices = (3) Hengchang Store on North Main Street, Yantai to All Stores = (4) Please forward to (or tell, telegraph, mail, leave) Wang Guoxiu, Ye Zhicheng, No. (117), Xiangchun Street, Changsha = (5) Shen Xiongshen, No. (561), Wangfujing Street, Beiping to Jin Daqing to Shi Kaiwen = (6) 0022 Beiping = to Wang Weicheng, Li Ziwu, Zhang Hansheng =</p>
<p>Since no address is listed before the name of the second addressee and the name of the third addressee in all the above examples, the words please, tell, telegraph, mail, leave, etc. added to the word "to" are only a method of forwarding and there is no trickery, so the telegram can still be received and forwarded by the first addressee. The names of the second addressee and the name of the third addressee, together with the words "to" or "please forward", "tell", "telegraph", "mail", "leave", etc., can all be included in the addressee's address and charged accordingly.</p>
<p>If there are two or more names written together, the meaning of which may change due to different readings, for example:</p>
<p>(1) 6892 Luming has arrived at Zhushin, Shashi, not mind Zhu, (2) Zhu Maoru and Li Jieyin of Jiujiang Dahua Hotel take Jianghua to Xunlu, (3) Fang Ziren and Guo Yunfeng, No. (53), Shaanxi Street, Ba County, died, hope to transport back Qin.</p>
<p>Although the name of the second person in the above three examples can be included in the name of the addressee's address to calculate the number of words, if the telegram is only sent to the first addressee, the first example should be written as "6007 Tianjin = Luming has arrived at Zhushin, not mind Zhu", the second example should be written as "Zhu Maoru, Jiujiang Dahua Hotel = Li Jieyin takes Jianghua to Xunlu", and the third example should be written as "Fang Ziren, No. (53), Shaanxi Street, Ba County = Guo Yunfeng died, hope to transport back Qin." If the sender uses the provisions of the above-mentioned supplementary measures for calculating fees to include the name of the second person in the name of the addressee's address in order to save telegraph fees, for example, "6007 Tianjin Luming = has arrived in Shen not miss Zhu", "Zhu Maoru Li Jieyin takes Jianghua to Xunlu, Jiujiang Dahua Hotel", "Fang Ziren and Guo Yunfeng, No. (53), Shaanxi Street, Ba County, died, hope to transport back Qin", then the meaning of the telegram will change due to the different writing formats. After receiving the telegram, the addressee will also have doubts, so the sender must not be greedy for small and lose big, and must declare to the telegraph bureau personnel when sending the telegram that the telegram is actually sent to someone or someone. Or separate the text of the telegram from the name and address of the addressee into two lines, so that the telegraph bureau personnel can separate the text of the telegram from the name and address of the addressee with a double-line mark, so as to avoid misunderstanding the meaning of the telegram when it arrives at the addressee. This should be carefully noted by the sender.</p>

<h3>The Importance of "Gonads"</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The human body is densely covered with glands, the most important of which are the "gonads."</p>
<p>"Gonads" are not only directly related to offspring, but also to the soundness of the brain, the nourishment of essence and blood, the development of muscles, the prosperity of nerves, the rise and fall of resistance, the maintenance of health, and the restoration of youth, all of which are governed by the "gonads."</p>
<p>If the "gonads" decline or there is a lack of endocrine in the gonads, various symptoms of weakness will arise, and development will be lost, resulting in early decay and old age.</p>
<p>For example, this spring, a patient named Bao Hongyi came to complain of symptoms such as body tremors, cold limbs, night sweats, and palpitations. I found that the root of his disease lay in the atrophy of the gonads, which led to extreme weakness of the nerves. I immediately prescribed medicine to treat the symptoms and instructed him to purchase the gonadal preparation "Shengzhisu" from the Zhengwei Pharmacy. After taking it for several boxes, his nerves immediately turned prosperous, and the symptoms disappeared as if they had never happened. He regained strength and development.</p>
<h3>Radical Cure for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>This disease is mostly caused by excessive masturbation, but also by physical weakness. Patients have failing gonads and relaxed vas deferens. With a little irritation, seminal emission will occur. Although there is a difference between having dreams and not having dreams, the pathology is the same.</p>
<p>This disease is often accompanied by symptoms such as insomnia, forgetfulness, yellow face, and thin muscles, all of which are caused by frequent consumption of essence. The treatment should combine consolidation of essence and replenishment of essence, treating both the symptoms and the root cause, so as to achieve a radical cure.</p>
<p>Last month, a young man with seminal emission, Zhou Zhenxiong, came to see me. I instructed him to purchase the famous medicine "Ximituoshi Guding Pian" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy to consolidate his essence and treat his seminal emission, and to take "Shengzhisu" to replenish his essence and marrow and treat his deficiency. After taking five boxes in a row, all the symptoms disappeared suddenly, and he regained development and regained the strength he had never had before.</p>
<h3>One Case of Stomach Pain Requiring Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Stomach ailments are varied. The most common ones include stomach cramps, stomach ulcers, gastric dilation, gastritis, hyperacidity, acid reflux, indigestion, and weak stomach. In severe cases, pain is present.</p>
<p>If medications are used for stomach ailments and stomach pain without comprehensive consideration, a radical cure is impossible. The condition often lingers for years, forming a chronic illness.</p>
<p>For example, last autumn, Zhu Xiaojun came for consultation. He suffered from stomach ailments and stomach pain that were incurable, so he used smoking to alleviate them, leading to addiction. Due to strict government bans, he repeatedly tried to quit, but the pain returned each time, causing him to give up halfway. I knew it would be difficult to quit smoking safely without first treating his stomach problems. I immediately instructed him to purchase and take "Stomach Pain Reliever" and "Digestive Supplement" from Taihe Pharmacy to cure his stomach ailments. Then, he used "Reproductive Essence" to eliminate his nicotine addiction and break his smoking habit. He claimed to feel mentally refreshed, far surpassing the results of general quitting methods.</p>
<h3>Uterine Inflammation, Leukorrhea, and Irregular Menstruation</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Many gynecological diseases originate from the weakened health of the uterus. Patients experience irregular menstruation, sometimes early, sometimes late, sometimes heavy, sometimes light. If the cause is uterine inflammation, it is often accompanied by leukorrhea, abdominal pain, and other symptoms. The body becomes weak, making conception difficult.</p>
<p>Last autumn, Mrs. Liang Zikui came for consultation. She complained of amenorrhea, abdominal pain, persistent leukorrhea, infertility after prolonged marriage, and breast atrophy. I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Essence" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Remedy" for external use from the New New Company. After less than a month of combined internal and external treatment, the leukorrhea stopped, menstruation became regular, and her breasts regained development, returning to the health and beauty of her honeymoon period. Last month, her relative Ms. Wang Xiao'e mentioned that Mrs. Liang was already several months pregnant.</p>
<h3>Principles of Bone Pain and Limb Numbness</h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Those suffering from kidney deficiency lose normal urinary function, often leading to excessive uric acid and impure blood. The uric acid forms crystal shards like broken glass. When entering the bones, it causes bone pain; when entering the tendons, it causes tendon spasms; when entering the muscles, it causes soreness; when entering the limbs, it causes limb numbness. In severe cases, it can lead to hemiplegia or complete paralysis, resembling disability.</p>
<p>The treatment for this condition primarily focuses on detoxification and acid relief. Our clinical experience often involves using "John Stenson's Bone Pain Tablets" because of their pure formulation, which is suitable for the Chinese physique and achieves the most satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Recently, I used "John Stenson's Bone Pain Tablets" to cure Mr. Cao Shenghe, a patient with long-term rheumatoid bone pain. The treatment lasted just over three weeks.</p>
<p>Nervous Breakdown</p>
<p>Mr. Li Runan of Wuchang Road wrote: "Due to congenital deficiencies and weak constitution, I suffered from severe symptoms of weakness, such as lower back pain, dizziness, and blurred vision. Thanks to Dr. Zhan Nianceng prescribing 'Reproductive Essence' and applying electrotherapy, I regained strength after about a month."</p>
<p>Escape from Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Mr. Du Decheng of Bao Ying wrote: "My younger brother suffered from chronic nocturnal emission, and medications were ineffective. Later, I saw in your publication that 'Hemitol's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets' and 'Reproductive Essence' could cure it radically. I followed the instructions and took them together. In less than a month, he was completely cured."</p>
<p>Couples Quitting Together</p>
<p>Mr. Lin of Bei Di Ao Road in this city wrote: "My wife and I were addicted to smoking and suffered greatly from repeated attempts to quit, unable to break the habit. We were introduced to 'Male and Female Reproductive Essence' for treating illness, strengthening the body, detoxifying, and breaking the addiction. Neither of us took it for more than a month."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Tianjin's House of Refuge for Singing Girls</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Recently, Tianjin City has undertaken many initiatives to promote prosperity. The construction of roads and parks are notable achievements. Reducing and waiving taxes for brothels in the Southern City is also a way to revitalize commerce. Most recently, the authorities have labored to establish a House of Refuge for Singing Girls, hoping to use the local prostitutes to restore the city's economy. This facility is even more innovative, a new municipal policy unprecedented at home and abroad!</p>
<p>The House of Refuge for Singing Girls, as its name suggests, is undoubtedly a place to reform singing girls. However, the purpose of this house established by Tianjin City is not to reform. It is using this name to turn local prostitutes into high-class prostitutes to promote the city's economy. Those admitted for education include second and third-class prostitutes from the Southern City's Qunying Hall, third-class prostitutes from Pingfangzi, fourth-class prostitutes from Hongyecun Huangzidi, and local prostitutes from the Sanbuguan area. The curriculum is divided into four types: literacy, general knowledge, singing and dancing, and arithmetic. Later, hygiene, sewing, and embroidery will be added. The teaching period is three months. Graduates are given certificates, and from then on, they can become qualified prostitutes.</p>
<p>The relevance of prostitutes to the prosperity of the city has been proven by facts. The commerce of various cities, large and small, is partly dependent on brothels to maintain. Therefore, as soon as the Tianjin House of Refuge for Singing Girls opened, it faced united protests demanding the city government withdraw its order and stop the facility. The reason for the opposition is that prostitutes attending the House of Refuge for Singing Girls will affect the business of brothels. Furthermore, prostitutes should not have knowledge and should not be close to officials. If prostitutes become educated and have government protection, they will inevitably make things difficult for their owners. In fact, the brothel owners do not understand the authorities' intention. Tianjin City is supporting the brothels in their business for the sake of the city's prosperity, and will not hinder their development. Raising the qualifications of prostitutes is equivalent to raising the business of brothels. That is the purpose of the authorities establishing the House of Refuge for Singing Girls!</p>
<p>However, Tianjin has used the name of the House of Refuge for Singing Girls to cultivate high-class prostitutes, which is indeed too clever in establishing a name and confusing the public. Furthermore, to promote the city's economy, the authorities are not devising proper methods, but are instead using the sex industry as a tool, which is a serious mistake. We not only find it ridiculous, but also feel it is absurd!</p>
<h3>A New Anti-Aircraft Weapon—The Sky Net</h3>
<p>— Chen Ruhui</p>
<p>The invention of one powerful weapon inevitably leads to the invention of another to counter it. In warfare, offensive and defensive weapons always follow one after the other. We can find many facts to support this theory.</p>
<p>Using coastal defense cannons and submarines buried underwater to protect attacked coastlines has shattered the naval powers' confidence in the combat power of warships thirty years ago. However, there is still no effective way to deal with the air force, which is incredibly fast and can move freely in three dimensions (length, width, height).</p>
<p>We know that anti-aircraft gun teams have been electrified, greatly increasing the chances of hitting enemy aircraft. However, when encountering brave and cunning air forces, we still suffer from bombings. Furthermore, barrage balloons hanging in the air can only do some "scaremongering."</p>
<p>Recently, a famous British inventor is secretly testing a new type of anti-aircraft weapon under the supervision of the British government. It is said to be very effective—</p>
<p>This weapon is actually a special heavy rocket or cannon shell. When "it" is launched from the muzzle into the sky, the explosives inside the shell detonate, causing the shell or arrow shaft to explode, scattering a steel wire mesh like fireworks, slowly descending from the sky. The corners of the net are attached with several small parachutes, so the Sky Net necessarily takes several minutes to land.</p>
<p>What kind of harm will this "magic" cause to the enemy's air force? When the Sky Net is slowly falling in the air, if an aircraft collides with it, the aircraft's propeller will be destroyed, and it will not be able to escape the constraints of the Sky Net, only struggling and falling with the net.</p>
<p>This design does not target just one aircraft like anti-aircraft guns, but targets the entire attacking enemy fleet. When a large enemy fleet attacks with great force, we immediately spread many Sky Nets on their flight path, creating a large area of traps. The speed of these aircraft is very high, and due to inertia, they are prone to a dangerous kiss with the Sky Net.</p>
<p>The opening of the Sky Net is the result of the rapid rotation of the shell (generating enormous centrifugal force). In addition to the net's own magical powers, the exploding shell also has incidental effects. If a piece of the shell hits an enemy aircraft, it will also face terrible danger.</p>
<p>With this invention, we can recall the "rotating hammer bomb" suggested by a magazine editor during the European War (1918). This bomb used two metal hammers to strike at both ends of an iron chain, launched into the air by a shell, so that the hammer rotated in the air, in order to increase the area of obstacle in the sky. This is certainly better than ordinary shells, because the area that the rotating hammer bomb creates is at least ten times smaller than the area that the shell can hit. That is to say, the effectiveness of the rotating hammer bomb has increased by ten times compared to the shell.</p>
<p>Regardless of the Sky Net or the rotating hammer bomb, it would be unbelievable to say that they are our ideal anti-aircraft weapons, or to think that we can avoid the massacre and bombing of the air force with this kind of weapon. In this era of turbulent war clouds, in order to seek the happiness and peace of ourselves (nation, humanity), we can only walk on the path of science, intensify research and invention. Science is not for war, but war is for science.</p>
<h3>Miscellany from Zunyi</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>Restaurant</p>
<p>Starting at ten in the morning, after about three hours, the galloping car, with a loud roar, drove into the city gate—this is an important town in the province!</p>
<p>To avoid too much trouble, we stopped at a hotel not far from the entrance to the city.</p>
<p>Luggage piled up in the hotel's passageway, and the Ford car drove into the car shop.</p>
<p>The old groom sat for a while, carrying a cane, making a funny face, and leaving the threshold with a series of thank yous. Suddenly, he seemed to think of something and turned back again: "When are you going to the province, Mr. Huang?" Old Huang looked at him: "Hard to say, I'll leave if there's a car tomorrow!</p>
<p>—Then, then…</p>
<p>—Ride, right? The groom smiled and left.</p>
<p>The most problematic thing was the hunger in our stomachs. In the morning, the time constraints did not allow for leisurely time, but now, in this unfamiliar mountain city, where can we find a restaurant? Our group walked on the stone road, all anxious.</p>
<p>It was a T-junction, looking around everywhere, but besides the flowing crowd, besides the noisy</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>unfamiliar sounds, what else? Asking the shopkeepers, they kindly told us that we only needed to turn a corner, and the "World Hotel" had not been open for long. Immediately, "World" gave us a palatial feeling in our imagination. We passed every storefront on the vast street, and finally, we had to say finally, we sat in the elegant room of the hotel in an extremely narrow alley.</p>
<p>It is best not to order your own dishes, but to listen to the waiter's recitation of the dishes and let them decide, otherwise, you may be disappointed. The weather was a bit strangely hot, and with the hot stove not far away, sweat kept dripping on the table, and there was a stuffy feeling in the heart, blocking the breath.</p>
<p>Hotel</p>
<p>At night, the mosquitoes were still buzzing as usual, and they did not reduce their numbers because of the change in location.</p>
<p>The two of us stayed in the east side room. The bed was old-fashioned and had not changed its style. The walls were covered with nice patterns. If you could count, there would be quite a few bedbug remains! If you compare it with the Yi Bao Hotel, this place is slightly better.</p>
<p>Exhaustion brought us into sweet sleep, around eleven o'clock. All the gramophone-like sound waves, all the disturbances, gradually disappeared from fuzzy to far away, completely.</p>
<p>Turning around, it was raining outside. The rainwater in the tile drain pounded the stone steps on the ground, so crisp!</p>
<p>The room was strangely dark, the lights in the hotel were off long ago, the sky was like lacquer, everything was ruled by a terrifying shadow</p>
<p>I don't know how, I woke up myself, my hair was very wet, a few pieces of the padded quilt were also wet, and there was a puddle of water that had not leaked out on the mat. I lit the candle and looked at Lao Tie. His whole body was soaked in the pool of water, but he was not aware of it, and sweet sleep had brought him to another realm.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? On the roof, rainwater was mercilessly pouring down from many small holes.</p>
<p>We started to move, moving the bed to a place that didn't leak. Later, this wish failed. The small room could not escape the rain's attack? So, we caught the water with basins, which was not only obstructed our sleep, but also could not hold so much. We let the hardship hover on the strings of our hearts, looking at each other, without saying a word.</p>
<p>Finally, we pulled down the oilcloth on the sedan chair poles, tied ropes to the four corners, and nailed them around the house in the manner of a spider web. This way, we thought, under the protection of the tent, we could get through the long night, right?</p>
<p>The rain was even heavier, simply pouring down. The tent? It had lost its effectiveness. We huddled in a corner of the wall, looking at the sky outside the window, with a common aspiration——let the rain stop, let the dawn's light pierce the dark world!</p>
