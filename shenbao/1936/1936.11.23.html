<p>— 周憲文</p>
<p>—讀山崎靖純先生排日的中國以後—</p>
<p>本年九月間，日本名經濟學者山崎靖純先生旅行來華，經北平沿津浦路而抵上海；我與山崎先生原不相識，某日承友人之介，得匆匆一晤，當時他卽表示：希望能在上海聽聽中國的經濟學者反對日本的意見；他並再四聲明：此來純係個人的行動，與日本當局絕無關係：談話務求自由，彼此毋須客氣；因此，我就於後二日介紹主張「抗日救國」的某先生與他見面：一來因爲他們談得很起勁，不容我從旁挿嘴；二來因爲我自知一介書生，縱有意見，也不能代表任何方面。所以對於中日問題，當日我始終無所表示。翌日，山崎先生卽離滬赴京，，旋卽返國。</p>
<p>現在，他由東京寄我一本雜誌，內載他的大作，標題特用紅油墨印刷，呌做排日的中國；文長萬餘言，是說他這决旅行中國的所見，所聞以及於所感。據他：目前中國的排日，在表面上確比過去好些，但在骨子裏則反比過去深刻，其間經過「三種階段」的發展，現在是由法西戰錢的排日轉向爲人民戰綫的排日；他又說：他這决在中國，碰到了許多的朝野名流；共中有「中國高爾基」（凡用「」號者皆爲山崎先生語，下同）魯迅先生，有「抗日救國運動驍將」章乃器先生，有「中國敎育先輩」黃炎培先生，有潘公展先生；此外如徐新六·傳斯年·馬寅初·褚輔成·蕭同茲·程滄波·羅家倫·胡政之諸先生，都曾見過面，討論過中日問題，聽到過他們的「高論」。</p>
<p>但是，這許多朝野名流對於中日問題的「高論」，顯然是不甚相同；他用姑隱共名的辦法，說「某先生」吿訴他，「日本最好請向南洋發展，不要向中國進攻；」這好比說：强盜進了門，請他向隔壁隣居下手；自稱中國為禮敎之邦的中國人，連孔老夫子「已所不欲勿施於人」的明訓，都不甚知道，無怪乎山崎先生要「姑隱其名」了。實則「請向南洋發展，」何庸「某先生」指示，日本帝國主義早列南洋爲其「發展」的目標之一，而且已在着着進行；請問：日本帝國上義果何所愛於中國，它要棄易就難，不向容易到手的中國進攻，而　關係複雜的南洋「發展」？退一萬步說，卽使日本帝國主義能够接受「某先生」的指示，棄中國而就南洋，但謂日本得了甫洋之後，就可不要中國那也祇是不懂得」帝國主義對外發展性質」者的夢想。其决是「中央研究院的傳斯年」先生吿訴他，「日本固然是人口過剩，中國也苦於人口過剩，且資源亦極貧弱，卽使多少有些資源，也不容易開發。」這好比說：强盜進了門，向之哀聲訴苦；雖比某先生「以鄰爲堅」的議論光明些，但亦怪可憐矣。所以山崎光生對此，就有「請日本不要看上中國了吧」的感想。實則，我曾在申報館召集的某次中日問題座談會上說過，所謂「人口過剩」者，祗是日本向外侵略的藉口；日本目前的向外侵略，與其說是因爲人口過剩，不如說是因爲商品過剩。試看日本以人口過　的名義，發動了九一事變，先後佔去了我東北四省，但是迄今五載，事實證明：日本人之向我東北移住者，爲數極少。如果我們眞認日本的向外侵略，是由其人口過剩的要求；並認中國的人口過剩，眞可向外國侵略，（請注意這一大前題）那末，不論傳斯年先生如何哀聲訴苦，說我「中國也苦於人口過剩，且資源亦極貧弱，」但對日本的侵略，恐怕仍無充分的理由可以拒絕。蓋所謂「貧弱」者，原係豐當的對稱，即系比較而言，我們要是沒有方法證明日本的資源確比中國豐富，或中國的資源確比日本貧弱（至少是中國的資源與日本同樣貧弱），則中國仍不失爲日本侵略的目標；傳先生不是接着就說中國「卽使多少有些資源也不容易開發麼」？好哪！中國旣然多少有些資源，而不易開發，同時，日本所有的資源均已開發將盡，故日本正不妨來替中國開發這不易開發的多少資源。强盜進了鬥，說什麼我們家裏也很窮，太太手裏卽使有點金飾，但也不容易拿出來，用這些話來對付强盜，除了表示一付「可憐相」以外，實在並無拒盜行刦的充分理由。老實說，中國的資源並不少，至少不比日本少；介是日本决不能因為中國有較多的資源，卽可向中國侵略；何况日本之所謂人口過剩者，「壓根兒」是倘謊。</p>
<p>其次，要算是「中國敎育界老先輩」黃炎培先生的意見，他吿訴山崎先生說：「上海有一句俗語，呌做喫了砒霜藥死老虎」，日本這老虎，如果眞要中國人的命，那末中國人就會吃了共產主義的砒霜，拼個同歸於盡。黃先生這種帶有幾分恐嚇性質的意見，顯然要比「某先生」以隣爲壑與傳先生哀聲訴苦的議論，「硬朗」萬倍；惟其如此，黃先生這種比較「硬朗」的意見，也就顯然引起了山崎先生相當的注意；所以山崎先生一則謂：在中國「排日意識的裏面，存有親俄的意識，這是日本最應考慮的一點。」再則謂：「中國的運命，就大局看來，不傾向於日本，就傾向於蘇俄；但是此時，不僅是中國政府的危機，也就是日本重大的危局。」而最後的　論竟謂：「在日本國內，如果不先建立如何可使中日共存共榮公正提携的理論與方式，則日本就有敗於蘇俄的危險。」當然，「吃了砒霜藥死老虎」，這是一個不得已的消極辦法，但是，嚴格說來，這種話還是帶有恐嚇性質的意見，眞正的希望，仍在日本這老虎能一口裏留人；」如果我們認爲砒霜是一種毒藥，（前提）吃下去的目的，祗在消極的毒死老虎，那也大可不必，不如以吃砒霜的一點點力氣，用　抗虎；我們所欲努力的，不是以自己的死來毒別人的死，是如何死裏逃生；萬一不幸我們也願意盡了最後吃砒霜的力氣而與虎抗爭以死。</p>
<p>再其决則爲「抗日救國運動驍將」章乃器先生的意見，他對山崎先生說，「我們的主張，祗是抗日，並非排日；」「我們所欲抗爭者，是日本的帝國主義，或是日本的侵略，决非日本或日本人。」這樣光明正大的中張，山崎光生當然亦得表示首肯，所以他始終是說：「第一：中國民衆之與帝國主義戰，我別無異議……但恐中國政府不能與帝國主義澈底一戰。」「第二：中國民衆的抗日，固然希望其成功，但是成功以後，究將如何建設？」中國朝野名流對這兩問題的答復，大多是「旁顧左右而言他；」但是這兩問題實爲山崎先生排日的中國的中心論點，茲就管見所及，略論如左；但仍因種種關係，不能暢所欲言，務請讀者「勿以詞害意」焉。</p>

<h3 id="c39">怎樣研究農業學科（上） <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 金陵大學農學院敎授章伯雨</p>
<p>（一）什麼呌做農業？</p>
<p>人們用勞力耕種土地，隨氣候地勢之所宜，及適合當地的需要，生產植物及動物，供我們利用——選種。耕作·保護·管理和分配農產等，都是農業上的工作，這種綜合的以土地爲主的生產技藝，統稱之爲農業。我們知道，人類的情感·知覺。思想或態度的本身，都不能影響植物和動物的生長，可是農業技術上的經騐的形成，不只是一種技術，也是各種因果，自然定律組合起來的知識，這種組織而成的知識，就是農業科學。</p>
<p>我們看了上面的意思，可以概括的說一句，農業是利用勞力與士地相結的一種耕種生產事業。</p>
<p>（二）農業有什麼特性？</p>
<p>農業雖與工商業同是生產事業，但是牠却有許多特性的限制，這裏我們且舉出一兩個最顯著的說一說：</p>
<p>（一）農業是依賴土地的無土地卽無農業。關於一切作物的栽培完全需要土地的，就是畜牧養蠶在表面上是似乎同土地不發生關係，但是牠們的飼料，像牧草桑葉却是由土地上生長出來的，此外關於土地的肥瘦，土地的分配，都是與農業有直接關係，因此土地爲農業生產最主要的要素之一。</p>
<p>（二）農業是含有區域性雨量的多寡，氣溫的高低，土壤的組織與肥癢，地勢的傾斜與平坦，日照的長短，氣候的寒暖，都與農業生產有直接影響。但是各地的情形不同，所以農業組織亦隨之而異，甲地的晨業未必適應終乙地，歐美的農業未必適應於中國，而中國南北的農業又因之發生很大的差別。</p>
<p>（三）農業是含有季節性的農業植物之發芽·開花·結實以及一切管理，統要隨着季的變遷，不能設法縮短和提早的。現在雖說有人在那裏努力早或延長生長期的試騐，　那種效果是非常的渺小，而决不會普遍所能採用，因此農業的改進，亦決沒有工商業那麼迅速</p>
<p>（三）農業職業敎育</p>
<p>在沒有討論這問題之先，我們先要明瞭什麼是聯業敎育？敎育是滿圓的解决人生的一種事業，不過人生各方面的要求不同，性質互異，所以發展的方法也就隨之不同了。職業敎育共實就是普通敎育，不過自分工之後，對於各種職業所需要的學識和技能，都要專鬥化了；在社團生活環境中，才有職業可言。所以職業敎育　以說是適應社會上的需要，培植一種專門技術的職業人才，以專門的活動，生產他人所需，而　接謀求自己的全部需要。至於農業職業教育又是付麼呢？以專門的方法或技藝，維持或生產植物和動物的生長，直接供社會的効用原料，間接的謀農業生產者的生活滿足的事業，所以凡關於農業的敎育，像農作·蠶桑·森林·畜牧　水產。園藝·農產製造農村合作等科，均稱爲農業敎肯。因此我們知道社會上的職業很多，而各種職業的性質又各不相同，所以職業敎育亦不能不按照職葉的性質來分類，農業職業敎育，就是職業敎育的一種，不過對於學生的訓練，完全注重農業學科和技能罷了。</p>
<p>（四）農業敎學的目的和範圍</p>
<p>道一點可以分三方面來講；</p>
<p>（一）小學農事敎學目的及範圍小學農事敎學的目的，不是在養成一個良好的農夫，乃是使兒童對於自然環境，以及自然界和人類的關係得到一種正確和廣泛的認識；同時使兒童對於農業發生興趣；對於農民生活和工作，發生同情和尊敬。最低限度亦要使兒章對於植物牲畜等學科有相當的認識和了解；假使將來升入中等農業學校，也是基本的準備。所以小學農事敎學的實施，除了多看多做以外，同時要設有成功與失敗的兩種實習，互相對照着，作極明顯實騐的基礎的敎學。</p>
<p>（二）農科大學的目的和範圍農科大學乃是研究農業最高的學術機關，對於各種農業問題，都應當作深切的研究，所以不州對於調查農業，研究農學科學，和農業經營的根本問題等工作都要深切的研究，同時還須注重實騐和設計以及研究農業的理論。</p>
<p>（三）中等農業學校的目的和範圍中等農業學校，是介於農科大學與小學之間的，所以他的目的亦自然和上述二者不同。照敎育部規定：「中等農業學校的目的在養成目力經營各項農業之人才；農塲技術員；農事指導員；農業合作，農業推廣，農村改良等辦理人員，及小學農業科敎師。」因此中等農業學生，不僅僅對於農業各種實地經營的技能，要有深切的了解和熟練，同時對於鄉村社會各種事業，亦須有深切的認識，而自己思想之敏捷，和身體的健康允須注意，這都是將來服務或升學的基礎和準備。</p>
<p>（五）我們到底需要怎樣的農業職業敎育？</p>
<p>我國近代化的農業敎育的設立，遠在光緒二十二年，其後雖然學制經過多决的變更，校名經過多次的改換，但是農業敎育的重要性，却未嘗隨之减輕。不過農業學校雖然逐年的增加，而農業學校畢業學生，却沒有出路，而我國農業依然沒有什麼進步，道是不是現代農業敎育，不適台於我國社會的需要？還是不需要舉辦農業敎育？關於道一點，我們要很澈底的明瞭過去農業教育失敗的因子。　農業敎育專家章之汶先生說：「中　過去農業敎育的失敗，是由於敎學方面之敷衍草率，實爲主要原因。學生旣未受實際之訓練，自無從事專門職菜之能力，今後中等農業學校欲完成其本身之使命，首應確定實施農業敎育之具體方針。」章先生是國內有數的農業敎育專家，幷比從事農業敎育多年，對於這一點自然有獨見之處。所以他對於今後中國農業敎育的實施，亦有以下見解：甲·全省各鄉村中等學校應根據其地方之需要各求解决其專門問題乙·課程之編制應各適應其地方之需要。丙·招生之多寡，應根　該學區需要農事人才之數量。丁·造就之人才應作統盤之交配·戊·調查畢業生　職狀况以作學校改進之根據。己·統計學區內失學之靑年，予以補習敎育之機會。此外學校之內容應力求充實，農　之力求廣大，圖書應力求豐富，而敎師允須學能兼備。以後辦理農業敎育者，如果眞能按照章先生的話，切實去做，那我可以說，以後的農校畢業生，不會沒有出路；而學校所敎授的農業，亦不會與社會不能發生密切的關係。總之以後的農業敎育要與社會打成一片，而學生要豐富的學識和經騐，幷且能實地　　，這樣中國農業敎靑，才可以完成牠的使命，踏上復興農業的大道。</p>
<p>（六）爲什麼研究農業？</p>
<p>關於各級學校設立農業科的目的和範圍，上面已大略的討論過，我們再討論到現代中等學生爲什麼要研究農業這一點可以從幾方面來講：</p>
<p>（一）農業本身　農業是一種基本的實業，無論人們的衣，食，住，行各種原料，都是直接和間接的從農業生產品上得來的，就是振興工業，也非得把農業改進不可。因爲工業上的原料，大都取給於農產。我國全國耕他面積據金陵大學敎授卜凱氏的估計，的有一，五七八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇畝，直接依賴土地爲生的農民，至少有三萬萬五千萬人口，晨接依賴土地維持生活，有一萬萬多人，所以以全人口分配土地每人只得三畝地，而且我們人口自然增加率很大，據金陵大學農業經濟系的調查，爲百分之一，四三人。全國全人口姑算作四萬萬五千萬吧！則全國總人口在一年之內就要增加六百四十萬人。我們看這樣的人口壓迫，我們唯有從改良農業入手來解决。再則我們土地已經利用四千多年了，地力虧失殆盡，若不從事積的的耕種，實在難以維持。所以我們應當研究農業，使農業的技術，一天一天的進步，農民的知識，一天一天的增加。人民一天一天的富，國家一天一天的强，那麼纔可以同世界列强互相競爭，不致老受人家的經濟壓迫。</p>

<p>中英滇緬未定界的勘劃問題從一八九七年延擱到現在已四十年了去年四月九日我政府才和英國商妥由中英各派委員二人國聯派中立委員一人組織勘界委員會以中立委員爲委員長前往滇緬南段未定界處從事會勘七月委員會組織成立十二月一日我方委員梁字皋伊明德英方委員寇來規革樂斯中立委員瑞士人伊斯蘭到達戶算開始勘界到今年四月因雨季屆臨瘴氣作祟工作中止我方委員梁宇皋乃返京報吿現在雨季已過梁委員重又啟程赴滇預定從明年元旦起繼續會勘界務在雨季以前全部勘竣久懸未决的勘界問題也許藉此可以獲得部分的解决罷</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3 id="c89">東華陷於苦戰　三比三搆和臘克斯　李寗因病缺席守衛力量减色　臘克斯十人應戰始終佔優勢　雙方表演緊張萬分蔚然大觀 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>本季聯賽、昨日東華第一次遭遇勁敵、對手臘克斯、已公認爲本屆最英勇善戰之隊伍、先前法商雖會以七比五勝、竟從死裏逃生、幾爲所敗、昨與東華會師逸園、一塲激烈抗戰、乃意料中事、故蒞塲觀賽者達四五千人、此爲本屆聯賽觀衆最多之一决、局勢之緊張興奮、亦屬少見、而愈至最後幾分鐘、戰情愈爲激烈、觀者驚心動魄裏足出神、熱烈聲援、幾忘其比賽之將終、</p>
<p>局情緊張怡神悅目</p>
<p>劇戰結果、爲三比三和局、此爲東華第一次損失、以比數之接近、而終至於和局、固已可證明兩隊實力之平衡、然又不能謂非東華球運之佳妙、而每决臘克斯勝球後、東華之即能加以報復、亦足見其奮鬥抗敵之苦心、殊可嘉許然非臘克斯第二次十二碼罰球不中、恐猶未可樂觀也、全局以臘克斯奔馳之快捷、陣綫之鞏固、競爭之激烈、以及東華誓師抗敵、力圖收復失地之果敢精神、雖未能克敵制勝、而兩者表演之如此緊張、俱使覜者情緒旺盛、怡神悅目、引爲大觀、</p>
<p>行動敏捷裁判不易</p>
<p>但所引爲美中不足者、卽裁判員張樂、受雙方球隊以及觀衆之不滿、使球塲空氣超乎純潔、因比賽進行之敏捷、行動之犀利、使裁判員奔走不遑、目不暇接、難免發生措置失當之弊、而遭任何方面之責難、以「旁觀者淸」之立塲下、張君確有判决失誤之處、東華最後一球之攻入、顯易越位、但來不及糾正、臘克斯右前衛勃利夫之剁令離塲、似可代以「警告」、以其動作雖甚非禮、尚非正面衝突、東華守衛有一决在門前急忙中由背後將敵絆倒救球、未罰十二碼、東華第二次之被罰十二碼球、似又過甚、但若設身處地、此種錯誤、實屬難免、亦未可厚非也、</p>
<p>李寗缺席守衛鬆弛</p>
<p>昨日東華最大之損失、厥爲李寗之因病缺席、內衛方面、大受影響、更因顧尙勷之退任李聯、前衛力量亦受打擊，丁兆成固係狗生之犢、足任此職、無如經騐不足、搶球阻攔、尚少把握、而顧之內衛、亦遠不及前衛之出色、馮運佑內外兼顧、心餘力拙、陳鎭和助守助攻、最爲勞苦、前鋒之兩翼、仍無起色、平平而已、孫錦順毗能作前鋒之第二防綫、不能正面破敵、文奎麟經二人、殊少射門機會、對方中衛錢之穩固、實予東華重大打擊、西蒙斯獨擋中路、勞苦功高、爲目下滬上最出色之中堅、前鋒進攻之迅速、每使東華猝不及防、阿地傑雖老、依然不失爲英雄、幾决衝刺與傳遞、美麗悅目、麥達代替格勃門、使前綫愈爲活潑、如非十人作戰、東華尤難應付矣、</p>
<p>努力奮鬥造成和局</p>
<p>開　僅五分鐘、馮運佑因救球觸手、被罰十二碼、而負一球、幸不久臘克斯亦遭罰十二碼、由戴麟經射中、成一比一、二十五分鐘時、臘克期右前衛葛利夫被孫錦順無意問踢傷離塲、的五分鐘復入、意欲對老孫報復、因態度不佳、被罰離塲、從此臘克斯祗以十人作戰、不料東華反被攻入一球、後藉罰任意球、由孫錦順賈幼良合作立功、上半時乃成各二和局、下半時一刻鐘時、東華又被罰十二碼、幸榮才擋出、但不久仍負一球、最後掙扎、文　孤軍奮鬥、造成和局、此後東華攻勢殊盛、大有非勝不可之概、圍攻敵鬥甚久、臘克斯亦偶圖大舉、俱不得逞、</p>
<p>十二碼球　各罰一次</p>
<p>臘克斯先攻開始、雙方卽陷於激戰、戴麟經最先攻鬥、擦門柱而出、五分鐘時、馮運佑在門前救球、舉脚不愼、手觸皮球、被罰十二碼、寇梅尼一踢而中、東華先負一球、觀者爲之一震、而臘克斯繼續壓迫、顧尚勷救球慌張、球反踢向鬥前、要非陳鎭和如飛趕釗、禍事不小、十分鐘時、東華反攻、戴麟經引球殺進、至罰球區內、撥至右方、賈幼良赶上射門、與守門及臘克斯內衛跌成一團、裁判嗚笛、判罰臘克斯十二碼、戴中鋒照樣還敬、公平交易、</p>
<p>番將非禮　判令出塲</p>
<p>東華獲球以後、喜氣洋溢、戴麟經覓機再射、被琴生救出、葛利夫引球前進、孫錦順上前搶奪、誤傷葛利夫、葛離塲敷藥、五分鐘後再度入塲、欲圖報復、一决在臘隊門前、欲對孫錦順非禮、裁判員卽判令離塲、從此臘隊祗以十人應戰、而士氣並不稍衰、寇梅尼興兵中原、直驅而進、　華諸衛、均被落在後方、形勢千鈞一髮、小黑炭見勢不妙、如飛趕上、由背後將其一絆、葛梅尼雖未跌倒、但球已落在身後、黑炭從容救出、未判罰球、可謂大幸、</p>
<p>先後再中　禮來禮去</p>
<p>臘克斯繼續園攻、東華衛士、似不能五相呼應、遂使敵騎猖獗騷擾不已、西蒙斯　住中路、前後接應、混戰中、寇梅尼猛射一球、穿門角而進、恰中要害、榮才懊傷萬分、東華開球力攻、孫錦順失去良機、萬象華右側踢罰球、挑送殊佳殊文奎頭頂被接、戴麟經捲土重來、與文奎聯終推進、得罰球機會、老孫主踢、賈幼良中路截住、加上一脚、果然成功、於是父成各二和局、</p>
<p>顧莊互讓　漁人得利</p>
<p>上半時過後、臘克斯頗有憤憤之色、經管理員訓話一番、各個振作精神、開賽後、先發制人、到處擾動、東華合力防守、險象環生、忽父被罰十二碼球、羣衆頓足而嘆、臘克斯則面示得色、寇梅尼二决操刀、一脚踢出、中門柱彈出、雷痕趕上再攻、卒被榮才救出、喜出望外、但臘克斯再度進犯、顧尚勷莊友仁彼此相讓、讓球於榮才、而不顧敵騎之窺伺於後、被阿地傑趕上射入門內、寃哉枉也、</p>
<p>小許奮勇　造成和局</p>
<p>東華見勢不佳、力圖收復失地、全隊士氣整刷、個個奮勇聲援之聲、起於兩邊、文奎引球向中路推進、守門愛區谷夫捷足先登、將球踢出、戴麟經隨後趕到、　踢入門因文奎越位作廢、不久、許略受微傷、離塲後片刻卽入、繼續逼迫、卒由許文奎射中敵門造成各三和局、東華死裏逃生、再圖勝利希望、極力掙扎全軍包圍敵門、內衛亦出而助戰、殺氣騰騰、敵軍四面楚歌、空氣愈爲緊張、臘克斯急急惶惶、招架不暇、頗露慌忙之狀、終得保住江山、並復度以極快之姿勢、竄入東華腹地、勃林蓋聲勢汹汹、卒不得逞、和局而散、</p>

<p>昨日在逸園舉行之東華足球會與臘克斯一役、裁判張樂、處罰似欠失當、幸成和局、否則、難免發生爭執、東華以李寗患病缺席、失一大將、如失屛障、幾釀成大禍、臘隊下半時、雖以十人出塲、應戰勇敢、東華得以不敗、亦倖致焉、全局戰情緊凑、各有驚濤駭浪、惟束華之失第三球、實由於兩內衛之不合作、坐使敵人收漁人之利、綜觀全局、十二碼有三决之多、其間或難免有所出入、又某决黑炭在禁衛綫內鈎入、竟未判罰、至東華得第三球時、竟判許文奎越位、而第四球亦係越位而不取消此或因局勢緊張、情緒慌張之故、（老球迷投稿）</p>

<p>（香港特訊）海上足球界老友徐亞輝·徐亨·二君、現在香港演出、徐亨隸東方會、任守門職、徐亞輝爲吾國世運代表團返國之晨後一人、甫由星洲抵港、上星期日爲九華會效勞、任中堅之職、或將久居香港、而隸該會、查今年香港足球界、情形與往年略異、甲組中華人球隊佔五隊之多、茲略介紹如下、</p>
<p>香港尋常杯甲組最近形勢</p>
<p>東方會</p>
<p>徐亨所屬之東方會、係一新興球隊、原屬乙組、本屆才升入甲組、成績當屬可觀、前週曾凈勝西警四球、上星期六（十四日對現居首席之奧斯德隊、以個人技術及整個實力而論、東方均覺不如、但明知不敵當前、全隊同心協力、作殊死戰、氣概非凡、可惜開首八分鐘內、意外失去一球、下半時不絕反攻、但又不絕錯過良機、臨到終塲幾秒鐘、得十二碼罰球機會、陳宇鈿猛射、却被對手擋出、皆望和局、竟成泡影、其若何不幸耶、而徐亨表演之出色、救出無數險應、博得一致好評、其陣綫如下、</p>

<p>金百兆　陳宇鈿　宋　聖　鄭少康　陳炳土</p>
<p>九華會</p>
<p>東方會外、另一新隊爲九華會、但該會名目雖新、人材則均屬沙塲舊侶、大半爲以前中華會會員·幾無一而非也、陳洪光徐亞輝之外、他如蕭殿廉·麥紹漢·黎國劍黃永康·鄧廣森·何左賢等、均惜日中華名將也、是以本屆中華會實力、大受打擊、該會上星期日（十五日）對　　夏比賽、不幸以零比二慘收、徐亞輝因久疏練習、表演减色、而下半時之十二碼罰球、亦被鄧廣森請客、致吃鴨蛋、其陳綫如下、</p>

<p>陳洪光　麥紹漢</p>
<p>何佐賢　徐亞輝　黎國釗</p>

<p>南華華</p>
<p>南華會之弟弟兵南華華，今年靑出於籃、成績在老大哥南華南之上、各球員大都新人、年靑力壯、正如初生之犢、躍躍善戰、故出兵以來、除一决和局後、尚未敗北、實際上現名列首席、港人稱之曰「朝氣洋洋、洵不虛也、上星期六與西洋會戰、又以四比二勝、　者謂僅勝四球、未免太少、可足見南華華之實力矣、該隊中鋒卽曾來滬一度加入東華之陳德輝、其在東華時代、扺出任乙組隊中、甲　則用非其材、故從未得一决成功之表演、因此海　球迷對陳之印象、亦甚淡薄、而陳之在香港也、則已成爲時　名將矣、因其左右、俱能合作、得以發揮其長、顯其固有身手也、由此可見上海香港兩地足球程度之高下、而所「一海派」、甚中節之談也、</p>

<p>南華南</p>
<p>南華南已至老熟時期、李惠堂之不參加，爲最大之損失、而李君原已聲明從此歸隱林泉、事受優游之樂、蓋英名已廣傳四海、再則亦無復他求矣、卽不告迅亦不肯輕易下海、更不屑勞神損力之聯賽也、該隊守門、黃紀良包家平平不常出席、由新人朱兆恒代替、表演不及南華南之黃華繼、上星期日以三比零戰勝中華會、其最近陣容如左、</p>

<p>李國威　劉慶材　梁榮照</p>
<p>鄭季良　黃美順　譚江柏　黎兆榮　曹桂成</p>
<p>中華會</p>
<p>中華會目下已陷於材難之境、全隊盡屬新人、其實力之减色、意中事也、全隊復少聯絡、各自爲戰、出戰以來、已經九塲、僅勝一决、目前形勢、僅稍優於西捕耳、觀其下列陣綫、卽可知其實力之一斑、</p>

<h3 id="c99">中英交換敎授講座　講師張彭春返國　昨在八仙橋靑年會演講　題中英大學敎育之比較 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>中英兩國爲促進溝通文化起見、有交換大學講座之設立、去年我國赴英敎授爲李世允等、英國來華敎授爲愛溫斯、本年我國赴英敎授爲張彭春、張爲張伯苓氏之弟、現任南開大學敎授、及美國芝加哥大學特的講師、此次返國來滬、於昨日下午三時在八仙橋靑年會大禮堂演講「英國大學敎育與中國大學敎育之比較」、按英國有大學十六所、張氏此次已到十二所、對英國之大學敎育觀察甚深、茲將講辭摘記如决、以供國內辦理大學敎育者之參考、</p>
<p>英國大學歷史背景張氏首述英國大學歷史背景、可分三期發第一時期的大學、卽牛津劍橋兩大學、具有六七百年之歷史、爲英國最老之大學、其背景爲地主的、第二時期的大學爲倫敦大學、於百年前設立、是新興的工商業資本家的、第三時期的大學、爲四十年前的各大城市的高等職業學校、是注意於新的科學的、爲孟鳩斯德·利物浦·利智等是、但到現在老的大學也已轉變到新的趨勢了、</p>
<p>大學在社會上地位英國社會比較穩和的、安定的、變遷也比較慢的、因此在大學的人、無需乎感覺到眼前的政治責任、但研究政治的與趣很濃、比中國的濃得多、因爲興趣濃足以鼓勵各種政洽的硏究和討論、各派都有小團體、郎不同政見的也公開討論、不若中國大學生對政治興趣太薄弱太簡單、</p>
<p>大學生活方式一般英國的大學生生活方式、分成小團體、每一小團體內有先生與學生共同生活、這因爲英國的大學都是宗敎的修道院的　織、但現在則此種空氣已少、而幽體生活仍存在、他們的分院、不以學科爲單位、而以住爲單位、住在一起的卽是一院、給以多方面的訓練、此性格之陶冶、組織的能力、應付世故的本領等、使他練習怎樣做一個人、尤其注重體育練習、但不是少數人的、是每人必須練習的、所以他們的集體生活特別好、</p>
<p>敎學方式採導師制中國的大學敎導方式、大半倣效美國、是演講式學分制、現已引起一般人的不滿、英國是採用導師制的、一個學生進去、不入整個大學、而先入院、每星期至少見一個導師一决或二决、見一次須作文一篇、並可與導師隨便談話、使導師能知學牛的性格、但經費必需充足、因爲一個導師每星期最多敎一二十人、而且英國的分學期與中國不同、一年三學期、每學期八星期、開學時注意刺激學生的精神與思想、放假時才看書積纍智識、故中國實行很困難、</p>
<p>改革大學敎育要件中國的大學敎育應如何去做、這裏有三個根本條件、（一）希望社會秩序一天天有條例、大學敎育才能改進、（二）師資的養成、（三）造成人與人關係的新的敎育空氣云、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>搪瓷製品之生產程序，可分成九步：一，製坯，卽將鐵皮砌成鐵片，置於各種形式之撞床機上，以撞成各種模型，如杯盤盆盌之類，然後硏光之或電焊之。二，製粉，卽將長石黏土等原料，按方配合，經過春臼硏磨等手續，然後再置於冷水中達六小時之久，卽得各色結晶之粉塊，瑯粉即以該項粉塊和水硏磨而成，三，洗坯，卽將鐵坯之雜質除去之手續，一用爐火燒去，一用百分之十二度之硫酸洗凈，以便搪瓷。四，搪瓷，卽將漿狀之瑯粉搪於乾燥潔凈之鐵坯上，以鐵又又入一千度左右之烈火中烘燒之，以成素質之搪瓷製品，五，美術化，如有必要，巳成之素質搪瓷製品尚須經過做字，描花，噴花等手續，使之美化。</p>
<p>二，上海搪瓷業之過去與現在　搪瓷製品原爲舶來貨，以往每年輸入額總在三四百萬元，漏巵實大。近年以來，因國人發憤倣製以來，每年進口已不過百萬元左右，較前减少四分之二三，實爲我國工業之一大進步。我國自營之搪瓷廠，十九皆集中於上海，上海之有搪瓷廠，迄今不過二十年之歷史。蓋於民國五年時，始有一美人（名麥克利）在閘北顧家舊設立廣大工廠，專製搪瓷口盃食　等物，後以不諳華人商情，遂將該廠盤與滬商徐道生等，改組爲鑄豐搪瓷公司，營業範圍亦較前擴大。迨至民國十三年春，該廠又歸嘉定童世亨氏接辦，易名鑄豐通記搪瓷公司，以迄於今。此外，當廣大廠尚未改組之際，有名廣達廠者繼之而起，惟不數月卽告停業，由蘇人董吉甫繼其餘業，改組爲益豐搪瓷廠。嗣後新閘橋西之鼎豐搪瓷廠，中日商人合辦之虹口工商公司，中華職業學校所附設之琺瑯科，皆相繼而起。民國十六年至十八年間，繼起者復有日新搪瓷廠華豐搪瓷廠，惟除華豐一廠外，其餘皆未發達成長，非閉欵，卽改組。至如曇花一現之小廠，若恒豐，華盛，耀華，振華，永和，大豐等廠，則更不及備載。故在目前，上海搪瓷廠之規模較大，設備較善，銷路較廣者，不過鑄豐，華豐，益豐，中華等七，八廠而已。今將其個別現况擇要分配於後：</p>

<h3 id="c176">近世所得稅發達之兩大原因 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 顧凌雲</p>
<p>－戰時財政與社會政策－</p>
<p>所得稅自從一七九八年發生於英國之後，世界各國，相繼採行，百餘年來，發達之迅遠，推行之普遍，遠爲他種租稅所不及。降及近代，已逐漸成爲多數國家租稅制度之中樞。考其發達原因，一方固由於所得稅本身具備良稅之條件，而客觀的原因，則爲社會經濟變演之結果。蓋自十八世紀末頁以降，歐洲國家，戰亂頻仍，自拿破崙戰爭，克里米戰爭，普法戰爭以迄於世界大戰，百餘年間，擾攘靡已，卽在平時，一切政治組織與經濟制度，莫不爲戰爭之預備，故若名之曰「戰爭之世紀，」亦不爲言之過當。在此種環境之下，各國之財政政策，除乎時擴張軍備，戰時籌劃戰費外，實無其他足述。平時擴張軍備，其經費可以從容籌割，且數額亦不固定，得酌量財政情形而伸縮。惟戰時戰費之籌劃，則數額鉅而需用急，實爲當時處瑯財政者所最感困難，故當時之財政家，皆集中於如何增加租稅以使人民負担戰費之一問題。但增加租稅，首須有健全之租稅制度，於是彈性最强，普遍性最大之所得稅，漸被發現。蓋惟所得稅，始能適應戰爭之需要而提高其稅率以增加鉅額之收入也。故若從歷史上而考所得稅之起源，胥由於戰時財政所促成；而所得稅之演進，允與戰時財政如桴鼓之相應。茲略言英國所得稅之史實，以見一斑：</p>
<p>英爲所得稅之祖國，故英國之所得稅史，亦卽所得稅史之典型也。一七九八年，時當英法戰爭，英國爲籌畫戰費計，不得不力謀稅收之增加，但當時英國稅制，係以關稅·消費稅·地稅等爲中心。因戰爭之影響，不惟不能謀收入之增加，反而呈减退之勢。若提高稅率，則一般貧民，負擔過重，於是乃特別就富裕階級，課以一種臨時稅，藉以獲得財政上之收入此種臨時稅，在當時名爲Triple　Assessment，卽今日所得稅之前身也。臨時稅爲戰時對於富裕階級一時的課徵，故隨戰爭之終止而旋卽廢止。</p>
<p>一八〇三年，英法戰端再起，於是臨時的所得稅再被採用，稅法上亦大加改革，如購張課稅範圍，减低稅率，規定免稅點及扣除額等，藍已具備近代所得稅之精神，此項稅法，於一八一五年英法戰爭終了後廢止。</p>
<p>嗣後印度叛亂以及克里米戰爭相繼發生，所得稅亦隨戰爭而繼續實行，由於稅法之逐年改進，以及人民納稅習慣之養成，使所得稅之收入，與年俱增，漸佔財政上之重要地位。無所得稅，英國之財政已不能支持矣。因而所得稅遂由臨時稅而變爲恒久稅，在英國租稅制度之機構上，爲重要之一部份。</p>
<p>迨未世界大戰發生，英國之所得稅，又有飛躍的進展，隨着「以三分之一之職責分担於租稅」之原則，前所得稅遂成爲租稅制度之中樞。單就職前與戰後之所得稅之稅收而觀，已足見進展之迅速及地位之重要。</p>
<p>時期　所得稅收入　佔稅收總額％</p>
<p>戰前（一九一三年）　四七、二四九、〇〇〇鎊　二九％</p>
<p>戰後（一九一九年）　三五九、〇九五、〇〇〇鎊　四五％</p>
<p>由上述英國所得稅之起源以及演進而言，完全與戰時財政同進退，推其原因，則由於所得稅本身，具有戰時財政之各項條件，茲約言之：</p>
<p>按所得稅係依照各人負擔能力爲標準而課稅，能使貧富不同之各個階級，其租稅負擔能力之最高限度，立於同一之水平綫上。故除非至各個人民之負擔能力，俱達於臨界點時，則終有增稅之可能。且所得稅之課稅客體，具有普遍性，凡有所得而達於一定限度者，皆有納稅之義務，非若他種租稅，僅就特定之目的物而課徵，限於局部，收入數額不大者所可比擬。蓋戰時需欵孔急，數目又甚鉅，有時雖亦能仰賴公債以資應付，但公債之舉募，視人民之吸收能力以及對政府之信用而定，且最後結果，仍不得不藉租稅以償還，職是之故，每一戰爭發生，鉅額戰費之支出，常仰賴所得稅以分担於各個人民，是於所得稅之遞嬗演變，亦常以戰時財政爲其推進之原動力。</p>
<p>迨夫世界大戰以還，社會經濟臻於更高度發展的階段。隨着經濟情形的進展而政治上形成了社會主義之抬頭及法西斯主義之崛起的兩個陣容，向之以財政收入爲目的之所得稅，至此，遂有若干國家利用其爲完成其主義之社會政策的工具；亦有若干國家，於財政目的外，更藉以爲調和社會各階級間財富之分配關係以緩和其衝突者。前者如蘇聯與意大利是，後者則爲現代多數實行所得稅之國家一致之趨勢。茲略舉蘇聯與意大利最近之所得稅制度，以明所得稅與社會政策之關係。所得稅與社會政策之關係。</p>
<p>蘇聯自從實行新經濟政策恢復貨幣租稅以來，所得稅續被採用。但其所得稅之採用，初非爲財政上之收入，而爲藉此以謀達到社會主義之目的。依其稅法之規定，得分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）課稅階級之嚴格分類，蓋蘇聯對於社會上各階級之地位與任務，頗爲重視，故將所得分爲六種，依其社會地位而規定不同之稅率。</p>
<p>（二）重課私人及私企業所得稅而輕課組合及國家金業所得稅，蓋蘇聯主張產業國有化，對於非資本主義的共同經營企業以及國營企業，盡量提倡，而對於私人及私企業，主張廢除，故課以重稅，使其歸於目然淘汰也。</p>
<p>（三）對於農業，亦分共同農塲，共同農塲之非共同化財產，個別經營農塲，富農四個階級。其稅率則共同農塲最輕，共同農塲之非共同化財產次之，個別經營農塲又次之，對於富農則課以極嚴峻之超過累進稅，蓋蘇聯對於農業，主張集體經營，對於農地，主張國有化也。至單獨經營之私有地，應不許其存在，故特別重課富農，亦所以使之自然淘汰也。</p>
<p>（四）累進稅率之普遍的採用，對於私人所得之稅率，皆採用高額的累進稅，蓋非此不足以限制私人資本之活動也。</p>
<p>蘇聯之社會政策，原以一切生產手段國有化爲其最高目標，故其所得稅制度，爲限制私人資本及私有土地活動之工具，藉以達到一切私有制度歸於自然淘汰之目的。站在社會中義國家之另一面者，爲法西斯主義之意大利。意大利之社會政策，一以保護私人資本爲原則，卽所謂「生產主義的原則」是也，故其所得稅制度，亦適與蘇聯處於相反的地位，但其爲完成社會政策之一種手段，則又相同。茲將意大利所得稅制度與社會政策之關係，摘要言之，以資參證。</p>
<p>（一）法西斯政府成立以後，對於各種間接稅陸續加徵，而於所得稅方面，則减輕動產所得稅繼承稅補助所得稅等稅率，同時將農業所得及動勞所得，亦列入於動產得稅範圍以內而課徵之。雖以半自耕農，佃農之農業所得，與工人之勤勞所得，及其他之動產所得爲同一之課徵。因有失公平原則，但爲達釗其保護私人咨本之目的起見，關於此點，有所不顧。</p>
<p>意國之所得稅，計分動產所得稅與補助所得稅二種，動產所得稅稅率，採比例制，補助所得稅稅率，採極輕微之累進制，故大所得者之負担，實與小所得者並無輕重之差別，蓋所以優待大所得者以提倡私人資本之發展也。</p>
<p>（二）對於資本家課徵租稅，直接足以减少其資本，損害其活動之力量，故意國對於所得稅之稅率，力謀减低，一面盡量擴張課稅範圍，使一般勞動階級以及小所得者，亦受課徵，與各國「重課大所得輕課小所得」之一般原則，背道而馳。但資本家受到輕稅率之優惠，俾助長其活動之能力。蓋生產中義原則，對於妨害私人財富之增加，力求避免者也。</p>
<p>意大利所得稅制度，已略述如上，衝之於蘇聯之所得稅制度，實屬相映成趣，蓋世界政治進展至路綫，趨於方向相反的兩極，所得稅制度自亦隨之而分道演習，若就所得稅之本質對於社會政策而論，於其說適宜於法西斯主義之意大利，毋寗說適宜於社會主義之蘇聯。</p>
<h3 id="c177">中菲美個人所得稅的比較 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 謝菊曾</p>
<p>上海英文大美晚報，最近曾委託其法律顧問。將中國所得稅中之屬於個人所得部份，興美菲兩國的現行稅率，作一比較，列成圖表，加以說明，非常詳朋，本文卽係根據該報的資料而來。不過原稿誤會我國個人薪給所得，自四十元開徵，而以最初的三十元爲免稅額，略與事實不符。茲特加以糾正，並及其計算的數字。　譯者注</p>
<p>爲什麽拿美國的稅率來與中國所得稅暫行條例裏的稅率來比較？因爲別國的所得稅法綜錯複雜。不易對照，惟有美國的較爲單純，用以與極簡單的中國稅率對照，不致牛頭不對馬嘴。其次美國的所得稅法，施行多年。對它制定的原則。迄今尚無重大修改的要求。而且菲律賓以美國法爲藍本，施行於遠東地方，很著成效：而菲律賓的生活稈度，多少與中國相近，所以就出菲律賓法律來做陪客。實際上菲律賓所得稅法，在基本原則上與美國無所出入，至於數字上，則遠比美國爲低。茲將中菲美三國個人所得稅課稅率互相比較一下，就可以發現不少的顯異地方，如今約略來說明一下。</p>
<p>（一）中國對於個人薪給報酬所得，及證券存欵利息所得，加以區別，這在美菲是沒有的。照中國暫行條例規定，個人服務所得，每月滿三十元起徵，逐漸超過累進，直至每月賺一千一百元徵收千分之二百爲止。至於證券存欵利息所得，則不論收入多少，一律徵收千分之五十。今如一人每月薪給報酬所得在四百元以上五百元以下時，課稅率爲千分之五十。在五百元以上六百元以下者，爲千分之六十。在事實上最初所得之四百元，僅徵千分之四十，故在全部收入未達七百元時，所徵實不到千分之五十。不過在七百元以上時，則所徵遠比證券存欵利息所得爲重。因爲從七百元起，稅率遂步遞增。假定一人每月所得達一千二百元，則他被微收的數目，要比坐享證券存欵利息具有同數收入的人，超過一倍之譜。</p>
<p>（二）美國所得稅制，表同情於恃薪給生活的人，不但課稅很低。而且收人剛及課稅標準的，再予以九折的優待。</p>
<p>（三）中國稅制對適中及較低收入的，稅率遞進很快，而對月入巨俸者的稅率，則遞進較緩，美菲則一視同仁，無分彼此。</p>
<p>（四）中國稅制對於納稅人家庭情形，及其所扶養家族的人數。概無區別。對於有家累的納稅人，也一樣地須照滿三十元起徵的規定。至於美國平常對每月服務所得之免稅額，的合華幣三〇二·五〇元。對每月非服務所得之免稅額，的合華幣二七五元。如果這人結了婚，便把免稅額擴大至華幣七五五元或五八七·五〇元。一旦有了干女，每增加子女一人，或多一無力生活的家屬，則免稅額再予擴大一一〇元。以中國家庭平均的規模，向來比美國家庭的平均規模爲大，而在中國的法律上，倘對於無力生活的家屬，不予扶養，更有遺棄等等罪名，而稅制上對此點，却未蒙予以注意。</p>
<p>（五）中國稅制個人每月所得滿三十元起徵，因之大部份的商店夥計·書記·車夫·機匠等，都在被稅之列。在美國則此類人的收入，遠不及所定免稅額之大，所以都可免納所得稅。</p>
<p>（六）中國對於個人所得稅規定按月繳納，一年分十二次，其徵收的費用。似須較美菲的一年一次者爲巨。而低級薪給收入的納稅人，所納的稅，恐只敷抵所得稅人員的徵收費出。假如一人每月工資三十元，納稅五分，　使有雇主代爲扣繳，而對於這筆帳的記錄製表等等費用，恐怕也與這筆稅欵相等。促使沒有代爲扣繳的人，還須派員微收，那未免太不經濟。</p>
<p>美國當推行所得稅之始，所定稅率，比本文表上所列者爲低。以後逐漸遞加，志在使納稅人的預算，不致突蒙影響。但是美國稅率雖經過幾度增加，到了現在，除去巨俸收人每月在行一五，六〇〇元以上外，仍比中國初推時的稅率爲低。因爲按照中國稅率，假定一人每月賺錢一千元，全年納稅的當一個月的薪給。倘使每月賺一千一百元，則他全年納稅簡直要支出一個月以上的薪給。而在美國，倘此人每月所得不滿華幣六千二百元時，則全年稅額，决不到一個月的薪給。換句話說，在中國方面每月賺一千元錢的納稅人，却與美國每月賺六千二百元的納稅人同樣待遇。那賺六千二百元的，每月扣去五百元左右，還剩五千七百元，雖然美國生活程度較高，尚不打緊，而賺一千元的，扣去了七十五元，未免有些影響啊。</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （閻重樓）　　人類的思想進步，也就是社會的地位增高。世界上思想的損失，比較世界上一切物質的損失爲大。　　世界上埋沒了的有用的思想，此較實現了的有用的思想爲多。　　我們不能估計使人們好的思想都引用出來，社會所獲得的有多麽大的福利。　　人們的思想，對於善的觀念大致是相同的，對於惡的觀念大致也是相同的。　　許多人祗知道缺乏金錢的窮困，而不知缺乏思想的窮困！　　思想沒有增進，而祗是金錢多些收入，也還不過是個愚人。　　廣大的世界，不能受狹小的思想支配。美麗的世界，不能受錯誤的思想沾汚。　　世界的生命繫於思想，思想能使世界變成一個地獄，也能使世界變成一個樂園。段執政逸談  淸癯　　段芝泉先生，病歿滬濡，海內外悼之，其政續卓卓可紀者，無俟覼縷，洵所謂一代偉人，可當之無愧已；茲拾其一二佚聞，志之如次，倘亦景仰先生者所欲知乎？　　段氏，初畢業於北洋之武備學堂，時在光緒十一年，厥後，遊德意志，在柏靈城，硏習軍事學，未幾，卽歸國，而項城袁世凱創北洋新軍，練兵於小站，段氏乃任砲兵第一營管帶，兼陸軍學堂監督；迨宣統元年間，出任江北提督，說者以江北提署爲升擢之位，蓋王士珍亦由此得以拱衛畿輔，咸爲段氏慶，嗣果奉命入京，而洊升以握兵柄矣。然段氏離任，而繼之者爲雷震春，卒以行賄敗，地非不靈，人乃不傑，論者笑之。　　歐戰起，有以宣而不戰爲段氏譏者，顧於國際地位，因以增高，厥功匪細：世人稱之爲『干木先生』者，則以其時側近左右傾軋，彼此暗鬬，有以累之也。如徐樹錚靳雲鵬，皆爲段氏之智囊，然不免因權勢之爭持，以致部曲發生衝突，此亦不可爲賢者諱耳。顧値政局新舊遞嬗之秋，政地處於故都，秉權者恒有普通之兩病源，一爲私，一爲侈，私則以愛憎爲去取，而識鑒每顚倒於賢奸，侈則以揮霍爲結納，而財賦因之日流於虛耗，兩者之政象雖異。而受病則均，段氏不驚虛名，只求實際，淸末民初，政界上可稱爲庸中佼佼者此焉。　　民二三年間，平中做壽之風甚盛，若楊晳子梁任公等，俱以家慶爲號召，排日開觴演劇，祝賀者動以數百金爲禮，豪侈之習，無以復加，一若非此外不足以誇耀社會，內不足以娛其親者，時段氏適屆五十初度，其部屬欲爲之祝壽，段氏聞之，大怒，握筆親書一函，以致徐樹錚，函云『又錚弟台，頃某報載補壽一說，誠屬不明大體，臥薪嘗膽，恒虞不濟，竈火正熾，方以遊釜爲樂，事績無可表見，罪戾又復增加，天下責之，將何以自解；文聯旣成，不敢爲過情之舉，更無庸書寫，集之成帙，已拜賜良多，望以德愛我，善辭諸友，果爾，强我心之難安，唯有請命令以禁止之，相處有年，當能信之深也；卽請更正，並頌籌祉，祺瑞頓白。』觀此，則段氏之廉正可風，求之今日，又何可得也。漫畫的地圖  秋申　　從漫畫展覽會歸來，時刻在我腦海裏廻盪的，是幾張漫畫的地圖。　　一張是高龍生的「國破山河在」，畫面是簡單極了，素紙上祗畫了黑的海棠葉的邊緣，整個的葉子，全染了紅色，傷心的作者把那張紅葉的東北角，挖破了許多刺人的空洞，不要誤會這張歌紙，是被人遺棄的殘畫，這是幾千年的古董，被兇貪的野狼踐踏的啊！　　「日蝕圖」的作者是劉一，圖意是月球遮蔽了太陽，成了偏蝕，太陽光祇輻射着塞外的疆域，其他的地方，人們都袖手冷看着日蝕，朋友！不要再貪好看了！苟安的迷夢醒醒吧！　　在靠近　口的地方，我又看見了江敉的「洋貨中國」，那是用道地的洋布碎塊，剪拚貼成分省的全國地圖，想作者是煞費巧思同功夫，這花花綠綠燦爛奮目的洋布，誰見了不歡喜呢？朋友！這是野花的艷色，你穿着了就有槍砲的毒汁。　　從漫畫展覽會歸來，我哀傷我們的地圖！記黃花  烟橋　　菊號黃花，黃氏之菊稱黃花，更有雙關之妙。黃氏者，眞如黃氏畜牧塲主人岳洲先生也。十五日，主人析東相邀，作東　之會，適以事牽未赴。十九日，與　鵑冷月吉人驅車往，錢宿諾，主人餉以飮食，望觀其二十餘年心血之結晶，名卉嘉　，多不勝計，而八閱月灌溉增　　收費辛苦之菊花，尤　　節勁秋，淸香爽意，喜此行之不虛也，　　主人蒔菊，別有經濟，大致可分兩類，其一，皆平盆大菊，有多至百餘花者，莫不飽滿如靑春年少，堆之成山，燦爛炫目。共一，則小缶獨菊，修短相若者百餘，花大逾椀，皆精神奕奕，各具顧盼自雄之姿。故草盧中生氣盎然，於三百畝菜疏林木中，別成一世界。　　陶庵夢憶記兗州張氏菊海有云：弄花大如瓷甌，無不球，無不甲，無不金銀荷花瓣，色鮮艷異凡卉，而翠葉層層，無一葉早脫者，此是天道，是土力，是人工，缺一不可焉』。黃氏之菊，足以當之而無愧。然主人諳菊之性，能取種子以布植，能藉蜂媒以配殖，年有新花，深合優生之學，似張氏有所未逮也。　　瘦鵑亦嗜花若命，故有吳門花痴之目、對此乃徘徊不忍去。主人云，尚有數十本，留諸田塍，待明春與梅花同賞。功奪造化，是又足以自誇矣。　　主人年五十六，健譚好客，臨別殷勤相語云，菊猶未衰，若朋儕有淵明之癖者，在此數月中，儘可命駕而來，當倒屣以迎也。　　更正　十七日本刊所載，記民旋英雄呂晚邨，「晚」誤「曉」用特更正。高枕無憂？  　　蘇州魚菊會志盛  紫微　　蘇州王廢基五州路公園，每年在小春的季節裏，必有金魚菊花展覽會來點綴這冷落園林的，事先　公園管理處出徵求名種出品，分列東齋西亭，此次會期凡四日，愚於最後一日由滬往觀。　　西亭內桌子分列於爪字形，上舖白毯，雅潔得很，出品眾各據其一，盆盎羅列，標籤鮮明，就中以泗井巷孫氏之珍珠魚爲獨步，色有紅，白，花品分龍，蛋，草等幾種，魚體之珠，粒粒可數，另一大缸中有三年花珠兩對，長及五寸，珠更精綻奪目。紫羅蘭盦一桌，陳列在北窗下，玻磁缸，形式各殊，而且多用細巧的架子，再有花枝盆景在旁邊襯託，益覺古色古香，別有韻致。紫羅蘭魚，早繼吳中之社，他如北平五花，色彩艷麗，一時恐也難與匹敵。公園之魚，都五六年前物，老態龍鐘，權之及斤，已不是外間所易見，確很可貴呢。　　細種菊花陳列於圖書館中，列桌高拱，頗多新種，如志華花園之「秋香」，「綠海春光」，「笑顏」，「月光」，「四海昇平」，「松雲醉月」。金城花園之「靑山掛雪」。他如紫羅蘭盦之「虎鬚」，「周鼎商彝」，「玻璃翠」，「紫衣點雪」，「西施春睡」，「茜春紗」，「春水綠波」，「天然」，「玉胡蝶」，「十八學士」，「楓葉蘆花」，「　女」，蘇州電話局之「老君眉」，「大帝輝」，「墨荷」，「香雪海」，「老綠毛」等，均爲本年特出之品，別處不易見到的。東美巷葉譽虎先生之「散髮仙常」，「碧玉如意」，「鶴舞雲零」，琴芳花園之「錿國夫人」，則爲老種子中的精品，亦爲人人所稱道。餘如查家橋黃乃振君手植的靈芝，大小不下十餘盆，新人識見頗非凡品。癸酉藝植社之各種盆景北瓜，以小竹山菊配古磚作底盆，名貴可喜，殊爲生色　東齋是堆的菊山，高與檐齊，遙遠的望去，眞是一座滿滿的花塚，繽紛五色，薈爲大觀，還有陣陣幽香，從輕風裏度來，的確別有逸趣，使人要留連忘返了。在這已凉未寒天氣，公園有這樣的盛會點綴，自然是裙屐翩躚，游侶雲集，可以打破沉寂空氣了。中秋望月丙子中秋夜望月憶舊奉懷健生德鄰旭初諸君曁當年同好共患諸友  善善居士　　中秋皓月　多情，自在升沉自在明，萬里　寥天一色，十分圓朗夜三更，遙憐桂嶠西風緊，坐看燕雲北斗橫，匹馬關山人欲老，更誰前席問蒼生？　虎擲龍拏嶺海秋，我儀李白一登樓，舉杯邀月成孤賞，借箸當年愧拙謀，晦跡未隨玄豹隱，銷兵終伴赤松游，笠車人似知還鳥，南北山頭何處休？換巢鸞鳳  張恨水著　　第八回　杯水盟心靑燈話憔悴　勾金的指紅豆報相思　　在這一陣狂笑中算是結束了兩位小姐的談話。到了次日早上，友梅向夢蘭告辭回去的時候，却握了他的手道：我第一次和你們傳信的時候，希望你對他有一種切實的表示。夢蘭道：你現在就要走了，我寫信是來不及。友梅道：你就把你所愛的東西，讓我帶一機去，却要他看了你的東西，相信我的話，那就成了。夢蘭道：你這話有點不能成立。難道我所用的東西，上面部蓋有我的圖章嗎，不然，他怎麽會認識？友梅笑道：峨！倒是你把話提醒了我。你送他的東西不能糢糢糊糊，總要有個記號，才可以證明。夢蘭道：有記號的東四，我怎麽好送人？友梅道：記號當分兩層說法。若是明的，那自然，不便讓人看到。若是暗記號，你就送出去，也沒有什麽要緊吧？夢蘭將手微微的摸着臉，作一種沉思的機子微笑了一笑。友梅看到他抬起來的那隻手，在無名指上，帶了一個金圈圈的戒指，便笑道：你那戒指上，有你的名字嗎？夢蘭道：名字雖沒有，但是那上面有兩個英文字母。友梅道：英文字母，有什麽關條？一個字母，可以代表幾十個字。你瞧瞧拿來我，是兩個什麽字母？夢蘭對於他的這種要求，倒沒有加以考量，很隨便的取下來，就交到友梅手上來了。友梅兩個指頭箝着，對戒指裏面的字看了一看，笑道：一個M，一個L。這就是夢蘭的縮寫嗎？老寳說一句，若不是我從你年指上把這戒指取下來，我决想不到這是你的。你就讓我把這件東西帶去罷。（一〇〇）特寫虹口公園晨景  雅非　　迎着了蕭蕭的晨風，在朦朧的朝霧下，我挾着一本「現代小品選」，走上了那條殺氣騰騰的江灣路，照例，首先在我眼前出現的是那座觸目驚心的怪物，它張着一隻可怖的血盆大口，彷彿要把世界呑沒一樣。　　道傍，護道樹的行列，像是站班的崗警似地，密密的排着；傍邊是一個「友邦戰士」，一魂兮歸來」的所在，但園門前却是靜悄悄地，不像　些日子一樣，可以看到幾個穿着黑色禮服的「友邦婦人」，往裏面去行着九十幾度的鞠躬禮獻鮮花了。　　北火車站的汽笛，吼得這靜穆的空氣起了裂痕，使那些久經飄泊異鄉的流浪者，或正在唱着驪歌的游子，一顆寂寞的心裏，都會激起了無限悵惘！　　踏着給秋風打下來的落葉，好踩像着我自家的心一樣，使我感到無告的痛苦：雖然我還在一步一步地向前走去，但我已失却了前進的勇氣。我心裏懷疑着，以爲自己已不在美麗的江南，而到了暴風雨襲擊下的北方，不，甚至我有點疑心自己已離開了那個有着四千多年歷史的故國。但是我終於懷着那顆緊張而懼怯的心，悄悄地從「友邦戰士」的槍刺中間穿過去，走到了虹口公園門口，往身邊摸出「派司」來，向那個看鬥巡捕揚了揚，就側着身子走了進去。自已一個多月沒有上虹口公園來了；在從前，我住在狄思威路的時候，這裏差不多成了我的家庭花園，早晨看書，中午垂釣，晚上散步，我是每天要把三分之一以上的時間消磨在這兒的，有時，也和幾個朋友到裏向去談談心，或來一回沒有秩序的野餐。可是如今，住址離得太遠固然是一個原因，然而還有的是我實在沒有勇氣跑到這個可怕的地方來了。　　今天，我所看到的是和以前一樣地軟草如茵的草地，迂廻曲折的小徑，澄淸平靜的池沼，乾枯憔悴的殘荷，參差疏落的樹林，錯綜點綴的花朶，這些都沒有什麽變異，但是園中的情形，却顯然有點兒「門前冷落車馬稀」了！在偌大一個園裏，除了許多雄赳赳的「武裝友邦同志」，和「友邦男女」外，還有幾個「外國紳士」在打考而夫，我們自己的同胞却沒有遇到一個我默默地沿着小河彳亍着且已彷佛是一倘荒墓中的幽靈，一種無名的感慨已偷偷地爬上了我的下意識，我不明白現在究竟是一個怎樣的世界。是文明嗎，難道將別人家的東西强搶過來，算了自己的，而且還不許別人喊聲「不一字，那就是文明人的行爲麽？野蠻嗎，可是他們却都戴着一個好看的面具，披着一件文明的外衣，使人受他的欺騙而不自知，要不是文明國度裏的人，那來這樣高明的技巧呢？　　懷着一種憂鬱的情緒，在一個池邊上，把那一個癱軟的肢體坐了下來，那奴隸的悲哀却無法在心上隱逝：望着那些友邦兒童」坐在池畔悠閒地釣蝦爲戲，自己却感到彷彿給人打了兩下耳光一般的羞恥，這羞恥將永遠不會呌我忘記的。　　過去的創傷，目前的印象，我委實有點不敢想它了，於是，我便像逃定一般地溜去了虹口公園的門。新家庭與衛生  沈兆荃醫師主編振起我們的民族精神……　大家上前線去　　要有勇武的精神－才能報仇雪恥！　要有超越的智力－才能自强自立！　　靑年們速起！　奮力撲滅毀滅生　活力的神經衰弱！　　諸位。我國自從遭受國難。民氣激昂。羣情憤慨。舉國上下。莫不大聲疾呼。呌着「復興民族」的口號。這種愛國現象。確乎出自眞情流露。是無可否認的。但是。救國工作。並非單靠演說。通電。貼標語。喊口號。徒手示威。這是無用的。換句說話。祇憑空言不能抵禦敵人的飛機和大砲。結果不會得到勝利。我們必須要有超越的精力和健全的腦力。才能够御機司砲。百戰沙塲。運用計謀。征服强敵。假如我們沒有健全的體魄和剛毅的精神去作戰。那末心有餘而力不足。可以說。結果。也是要失敗的。國民體魄之不健全。足以影響國家基礎力之不堅固。這是在「弱肉强食。生存競爭」的現實。誰都不能否認的。　　「國家興亡。匹夫有責」。當此國勢瀕危。風雲緊急之時。凡我同胞。大家都要預備到前線去。尤其是靑年們爲擔負救國重任的當事者。更加要有勇武的精神。健全的體魄。然後。才能報仇雪恥。才能作一個自强自立的國民。　　國家民族文化條件。不是物質的。而是精神的。人無精神。就是沒有靈魂。人沒有靈魂還能生存嗎。國無精神。就是沒有國魂。沒有國魂的國家。豈能生存於世界。　　看罷。現今我國社會上的靑年。有不少是精神萎靡。身心衰弱。茲從各方面調查所得到的事實。而此等靑年大多數是患着神經衰弱症的。所以他們不論是學生或是辦事員。於讀寫或服務的時候。極容易感覺疲勞。不到數小時。就發生頭痛。頭暈。眼花。腰酸背痛等種種痛苦。以致精神不濟。只得敷衍因循。往往曠時缺席。成績非常低劣。像這樣的人。怎能在大戰時負起衛國禦敵的重任呢。所以。我們要趁這個時候。喚起全國靑年負起救國責任。首先就要培養健全之精神及强壯之體魄。振起我們的民族精神。來實地的努力奮鬥。獲取戰爭最後的勝利。這才能是救亡圖存的壯舉。　　現在我國一般患有神經衰弱症的靑年。所過的生活完全是時代落伍的生活。什麼灰心。失望。墮落。皆山於缺乏了健全的精神之故。這就是所謂只有騙壳。沒有靈魂的人。像這樣子我們的國家。我們的民族。不待外人的侵略。將來也要自趨於毀滅之途。所以我們要挽救國業。爭求生存。我們就要注意到靑年們的健康間題。對於神經衰弱症的撲滅。以積極的態度。喚起一般病者努力於鍜鍊。療養兩要點。現在我來推舉一種神經衰弱特效療法給讀者。如欲得新的生命力之健康。惟有常服滋養强壯神經的「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic。可解除你們的疾病和痛苦。播種健康與幸福。是近代科學至尊無上的貢獻。你們用此新生劑「米美爾補腦汁」之灌輸。便可得着人生的結髓。則以前萎弱不振的身心。將一變而爲蓬勃奮發。走上復興的途徑。煤油治療肺病之失敗  療肺專家沈兆荃醫師　　現今世界各國醫師一致公認　祗有臟器製劑（肺活）爲肺癆唯一之救星　　年來日文雜誌中，常見煤油療肺結核之新學說，並有煤油製劑，風行於時，詛知服者雖多，治愈者極少，且多數人發生吐瀉，或因而致死，故突被當道下令禁止，事後經專家以動物試騐，施以內服或注射，不數日而被試騐之動物，竟全部死亡，解剖以後，動物之各器官皆呈病理變化，肺贜且呈血鬱現象，所以煤油之療肺劑，不復與世人相見矣。　　大多數肺癆病家，皆知肺臟被桿菌侵襲，以致肺葉結核或潰瘍，最後則呼吸器官破壞，而生命不保，故所服藥劑，不外乎殺菌性，殊不知戰勝此病，全賴乎病人本身天然之抵抗力，藥物次之，但旣染肺癆，肺臟之抵抗力，自不足以與桿菌相搏，抵抗力日益微，而桿菌日益虐，病勢日益長，所以服臟器製劑，制止桿菌之活動，補充肺臟之抵抗力，則桿菌不殺而自絕，病亦不療而目愈，故臟器製劑，長期盛行於世界，治愈肺癆，不知凡幾，是以全球名醫，公認爲肺癆唯一之特効療法也。　　臟器療法，中外古代，早已發明，印度古法，有山羊血治萎黃病，我國古方有海狗腎治性機能減退，紫河車治衰弱症等，惟不明科學方法，未能取其精華，去其糟粕，故不能效益準確，近代盛行之Fhith，Weai『肺活』，乃科學方法製成之臟器製劑，亦卽治療肺癆發必有中之特效劑也。　　Phith　weai『肺活』之主要原料，係採取壯健動物脾臟及肺臟中提出之新鮮　Hormone（荷爾蒙）爲重要成分，增進病人天然之抵抗力，充實肺臟防禦桿菌之機能，將病灶築成範籬，封鎖桿菌，桿菌在範籬之中，旣不能活動，又斷絕營養，加以白血球攻擊之力增强，桿菌處於重重壓逼之下，雖頑强兇惡，未有不死滅盡絕者，所以任何嚴重之肺癆，雖諸醫束手，巳入最後階段，自服『肺活』以後，則食量增加，呼吸暢利，潮熱自退，咯血自止，盜汗；咳嗆；脅痛等病象，逐步減退，日見轉機，不久而霍然無恙，回復康健，其威力之宏大，效能之迅速，誠出於意外，使人驚愕不止者，且性質和平，絕無副作用，內服自療，極爲便利，木病服『肺活』而更生者，盈千累萬，無法統計，贊揚及保證文字，散見於各國報章雜誌者，俯拾卽是，允以德法英美等醫藥界，稱譽更甚焉。哮喘與心臟膨脹  （章元貞醫師）　　肺！爲呼吸器管　心！爲循環器管　心肺皆病危險可知！　　哮喘一症。中醫名曰氣喘。其症狀爲呼吸喘急。額背冷汗淋漓。胸窩悶氣欲絕。不能仰臥。欲言不得。痛苦筆艱盡述。此症原因至爲繁複。以氣管支病促成者爲居多。蓋咳嗆旣久。肺贓當然損傷。而心臟亦因以疲勞。以致心臟衰弱。日久而心臟膨脹。歷逼肺臟。乃呼吸困難而哮喘。故久咳或患肺癆者。什九必患心臟病。倘遷延時日。或治療不得其當。危險之哮喘。不可倖免。因心與肺。有調節炭養關係。互相因果。所以肺病與心臟病。有連帶之關係。哮喘一症。乃心肺兩臟所促成之也。茍一不愼。立致死亡。其危險程度。誠有間不容髮之勢。　　心臟膨脹。始於心跳。由迂緩而急促。跳突至不可耐時。心房懸懸若墮。呼吸促而哮喘起矣。治此症者。每藉麻醉劑求一時之靜止。迨藥力旣過。喘急依然。期乃治共標而不務其本耳。此症以前向無專藥。病者苦之。醫家遇十分嚴重時。亦束手無策。自德國Dr．　HumbertM．B．博士。發明氣喘新藥『哮立平』Holigin以來。任何哮喘重症。皆自垂危中得慶更生。誠對於世界人類。偉大之貢獻也。　　按德國亭皮耳脫博士發明之氣喘病特效新藥。名曰『哮立平』Holipin係內服片劑。絕對不含絲毫毒質。服之亦無任何副作用。能强壯肺臟及心臟。恢復其正常機能。而臻於康健。所以能根本剷除危險之哮喘。呼吸困難等症。雖在劇發之險。氣促垂危。轉側不安時。服之立刻見效。片時卽告平息。連續服食至兩個月以外。則病根已除。永無復發之虞矣。結婚前的準備　自問生殖器的機能健全否？  陸志成醫師節譯　　（法國性病學會月刋）　　兩性到了相當的年齡。除了極少數外。總免不了結婚的道樣一個問題。這個問題。我們務必充分地注意牠－因爲這是我們兩性畢生幸福之門。萬不可輕易放過。致貽他日無窮恨悔。我們在結婚的前夕。應該自問我們的體格可結婚嗎。我們從前犯過手淫嗎。我有暗疾嗎。　　假如我們在靑年時期。不斷地手淫。並且把性腺斵喪。破壞了他健全機構。而障碍發育。遺精。腎虧。頭目眩暈。終日昏昏如在五里霧中。健忘失眠。凡是有這等病的人。他是沒有結婚資格的。假使仍不從連把牠治好。而貿然結婚。則不僅害了自己。還害了對方無辜的女性。這簡直是極不道德的犯罪行爲。但萬一有此種不幸的疾患。必須未雨綢繆。施用德國愛生博士所發明之內分泌聯合製劑『還爾重』Well　Tonic內服。始可治愈。因此藥是內分泌製劑中的標準品。成分高貴。功效靈確。據法國性病學會會員的報告。證明有五百七十餘位患性機能障碍。不能結婚的男子。於服用此種內分泌聯合製劑『還爾童』Well　Tonic之後。婚後都能渡圓滿的甜蜜快樂的生活。</p>

<p>時代醫藥刊夫婦智識百年好合中之性生活  德國醫學博士張君實　　……性生活的不滿足常使夫婦失歡造成離婚的慘劇　……欲求真正的百年好合不可不培養充足的性機能　　百年好合是一句賀人結婚的套話，然而我看了這四字，却不禁起了一個疑問；怎樣才能保持永久的和好呢？離婚的案件充斥於法庭上；爭吵反目，又習見於家庭間：「百年好合」，究竟在幾對夫婦間能實現呢？當然，婚姻破裂的原因極多，有的是經濟的原因，或社會的原因，更有多數由於生理的原因。為着熱望每一對夫婦都能達到百年好合之目的，我願以醫學的立場，指示一條途徑，解決離婚之生理的原因。　　所謂以生理的原因而夫婦失歡者，無非指雙方的性生活不能美滿而言。性的生活原係夫婦生活中之一特色，也是愛情達到頂點時的表現。一對快樂地相愛着男女，在發生性的關係以前，無論如何，多少有點兒隔膜。性生活給人以最高無上的歡欣，也拉攏男婦的接近，消滅他們之間一切的隔膜，使他們的精神肉體，混然無間，合而為一。　　可是在雙方或一方的性能發生障礙時，結果便全然改觀。不完全的性生活使愛情降落到冰點，使相互地憎惡起來。　　陽萎早洩性器短小，遺精頻仍，男子的性能障礙不外於此。他們喪失了應有的機能，絕沒有使妻得到性的滿足的可能，這樣，女人雖有丈夫，也只掛名而已，與獨守空幃的孀婦何異。不甘忍氣呑聲的便鬧出了離婚姘居等醜劇。婦婦中也有性能發生障礙的，此等女子性感薄弱，或竟完全冷淡，對於性生活，一點也不感到興趣，不能與丈夫的濃情相共鳴，自然要使他不歡。　　這種不幸的結果教產自生殖腺的萎弱不振，性能失去了發動力，所以處處軼出常規。補救的方法只有使他趕緊服男性生殖腺素製劑「男用生殖素」，使她趕緊服用女性殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素」。這兩種藥是奧國生理學家斯丹那氏所發明，採用少壯動物生殖腺素的精華製成，使服者的生殖腺重獲健壯，來源豐富，性能當然可以恢復正常狀態。所以性器短小，陽萎早洩等男子的性能障礙；以及女子的不感症，均可獲治。至於男子的遺精症，宜兼服『希米脫氏固精片』，立能停止。這樣，人人皆可有充足健旺的性力，離婚的原因便可消滅大半了。　　（編者按：真正『生殖素』及『希米脫氏固精片，槪裝鐵盒，紙盒瓶裝者均係偽藥。）療養指導淋病與其並發症  美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培　　淋病好比是「星星之炎，可以燎原。」由急性而變成漫性，巳令人棘手，何況還會發生許多危險的並發症呢？這種病之善於蔓延，病家實有詳知的必要，方能設法防止。　　最簡單有淋毒性風眼，淋菌由手帕，手指等入目，往往能使人失明。又如男子睪丸炎，常人每以為是小腸氣，不知淋菌已沿輸精管長驅直入，治療不當，睪丸受損，會釀成男性不姙症。女子的宮淋也差不多，能引起白帶過多，陰戶濕爛，月經時覺痠痛，而造成女性不姙症。　　其餘如關節炎會造成手足跛壞；尿道狹窄使人不能排尿；女子的喇叭管炎，卵巢炎，子宮外膜炎等症均能使患者受非常的痛苦。自然，淋病的並發症種類尚多，此處以篇幅關係，不能詳說，但卽就上述者言，也已夠可怕的了。　　淋病患者最好在初起時，立卽服用黃色素與伐克辛的合製劑『安敵淋』，一方面能搜殺淋菌，一方面能於體內產生抗毒菌苗。卽使淋病巳轉為慢性，或則各種並發症巳在爆發，服用本劑，也可根治。因為為這許多病，歸本究源，都是淋菌在作怪罷了。本劑中的黃色素，殺菌力的高，決沒有他藥可比；伐克辛的效力在產生抗毒菌苗，將潛伏着的淋菌驅逐出來，讓黃色素去屠殺，所以『安敵淋』確是效力最強大的合製劑。性的開明  詹念曾醫師自凟的誘因種種及弊害研究　　……在兒童時期早已有此自瀆的種種誘因如玩弄下體等　……自瀆猛烈者首蒙其害為生殖腺與精關故弊害深遠　　一般地關於自瀆習慣的誘因，各國學界討論者頗不乏人。性病舉推土機福洛意德氏（Siegmund　Frevd）謂：把兒童的性生活，從那較諸普通的意味上所說的性生活，如能加以單純方面的討論，就能證明無論什麼只消是給與了快感的感覺，則便不問是何物，都是在性生活上佔有極大的意義。例如：局部是自不待言的，他如口唇，乳房，拇指等，舉凡是反膚的觸覺最敏銳而給與了快感的所在，都特別的名之為色情帶。　　這樣的色情帶，是無待乎他人，兒童自已便能夠刺　，而獨自地玩味快感。所以就有人特稱之為自動色情。所謂自瀆行為的現象，也要不外乎這種自動色情所誘起的因果。那幼兒以口唇接觸自已的拇指，便是自動色情的一種表現。其次在兒童時喜把玩性器，久這漸成習慣，這動自動色情所誘起的自瀆原因，比較尤為可能。然則，那樣的性的惡癖，是否已經確定在兒童時期發生嗎？那尚難謂為絕無疑問，總而言之，雖然有着種種的報告，但還未獲一定的結論。　　但是根據很多的學者研究，除上述之種種認其有誘起成年時自瀆的傾向外。此外僕役等的故作猥　言語和舉動，而使子女等發生快的興奮，這也是促成自瀆的誘因。其次淫書淫畫的不斷接觸，也被認為誘起自瀆的媒介。如不幸青年時犯上此惡癖，其弊害也隨之叢生，原因手淫能使精關摧殘，遺精爆發。加之生殖腺首蒙其害。陽萎，早洩幾為手淫者習見的弊害，因此之故，青年時絕對不能犯此惡癖。如或犯上，尤應堅決戒絕。對於手淫所引起的種種弊害，應從事於有效的療治。如有遺精，可速服『希米脫氏固精片』以止之。或性器發育受阻，早洩，陰萎及一切神經衰弱症者。必須服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』使首蒙其害的生殖腺轉弱為強，則性器的發育轉佳，性能健全，早洩與陰萎，可以澈底消滅，同時精足神旺，至於女子的自瀆者，除月經紊亂之外，則乳房萎癟，子宮障碍，如服以女用『生殖素』之後，不僅月經調整，子宮健全，而乳峯亦高聳健美矣。戒煙研究培補戒煙法之特點  俞伯符醫師　　近來舉國朝野，對於禁煙一事，深為注意，因此，各種戒煙方法，遂風起雲湧地出現。不過我們如果對於一般流行的方法，稍加檢討，便發現了個共通的缺點：卽戒者總有免多少要受點痛苦。就是為了這點痛苦，大多數煙民遂畏怯不前。　　培補戒煙法的出現，目前就在彌補這種缺憾，找出一條安全無痛的戒煙捷徑。我們知道：雅片是種麻醉性的毒物。久吸多後，全身的細胞，神經，都受着麻醉，陷入昏迷不醒的狀態中，這樣一來，身全各部的運動，不是要停頓了嗎？要他維持原狀，不得不每天吸點雅片，給他點新的刺激。這種狀態繼續下去，全身所受的麻醉日甚一日，終至萬刼不復的境無。　　培補戒煙法是使患者服用生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，以強狀萎弱的生殖腺，幫助他脫離麻醉的狀態。生殖腺是全身精力的來源，強狀以後，全身各部組織也跟着強健起來，也跟着清醒起來，這樣，他們雖沒有雅片的刺激，卽能順利運動自如。這種強狀全身，以打倒煙毒的新戒法，能在五六星期內，使吸者不知不覺，毫無痛苦地就戒絕了。　　有患者許大昌，年三十九歲，身弱多病，二十五歲時，偶吸雅片，頗覺舒泰，遂習以為常，成癮之後，健康愈見退步，始知上當，數度試戒未成，經余囑以內服『生殖素』，僅一個半月，煙癮旣安全戒絕，身體亦得康強無比云。性病講座  詹念曾醫師編撰　　（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　門診上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。　　（一）神經衰弱與早衰　　患者褚偉武，年三十歲，北平人，旅居上海巳十七年矣，職業電器行。（主訴）——早年在發育時誤染手淫，且躭溺過度，致精力衰頹，思想遲鈍，不僅時感遺精之苦，且失眠，健忘，耳鳴，頭痛，心悸，盜汗等病象，交錯雜呈，加之負担奇重，職務繁劇，操勞過度，心力交瘁，致上述各症有增無減，雖曾治療，然仍無效，近年來衰弱更甚，面部蒼老，白髪叢生，皮膚枯燥，精神萎靡，望之如將知命，前月乃投余處診治。（診時病狀）——遺精每星期平均四次，長寒怕煩，入夜時有盜汗，白盡頭最目眩。血枯神衰，肌肉削瘦，體重九十八磅（治療之法）——余診得褚君病源厥在精關的鬆弛，生殖腺之衰頹。乃每日為之電療一次，入夜服以鐵盒真正『希米脫氏固精片』，每次三片，每夜一次。藉此以治其精關，止其遺精，白日分晨·午·晚·三次服真正生殖腺素製劑鐵盒『生殖素』每次一片。藉以培補其生殖腺，消滅其神經衰弱症，挽救其早衰。治療兩月，神經卽轉繁榮，遺精於一月後卽先停止。種種衰弱症狀盡除，面色紅潤，體重增加。皮膚滋潤，脂肪充足，一切氣槪，大有生龍活虎之象矣。　　（二）手淫斵喪的挽救　　患者邱義山，年二十五歲，浙江杭州人，學界。（主訴）——十八歲時誤犯手淫，以致身體未能獲良好之發育，身體瘦弱，疾病叢生，尤苦於遺精，夢洩，頻見增添，廿四歲結婚，婚後早洩，陰萎，與趣索然，且陰莖短小，弊害顯然。上月初乃來余處診治。（診時病狀）——睪丸萎縮，陰毛稀少，性器之長度，不滿二英寸，雖在極度與奮時，衹及三英寸半，而又軟弱不堪，遺精，夢洩俱全。（治療之法）——除施行電療外，投以大量生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以增強其性能，助長其性器發育，同時以『希米脫氏固精片』治其遺精，治療至今，性器發育轉佳，遺精，早洩，陰萎諸症消除。白帶凶惡　　編者先生：　　敝人自出閣至今，常在病榻中過生活，故不僅體弱失健，而白帶亦凶惡異常，流量之多，殊覺駭人。吾夫監此情形，多方治療，始於上月服女用『生殖素』之後體力恢復。同是因外用『療帶靈』始將白帶根治。（徐瑩潔）胃痛根治　　編者先生：　　願忠實介紹胃痛聖藥，使困於胃痛諸君，早日恢復其健康，務懇將敝函擇改登出為幸。（從略）敝人患胃痛有年，且胃口亦不良，痛時如絞，旋向永安購得『胃痛靈』服之，疼痛立止，因兼服『健康素』故胃口亦佳（項英）乳峯驟高　　編者先生：　　余曾肄業南市某女中，大約因先天關係，故余之發育殊不佳，平時絕對不手淫。特別由於乳房平坦，健美喪失。幸得同級女友介紹服用『生殖素』三月。果然發育轉佳，乳房驟然高峯，願忠實介紹於同病者。（玲玲）甜情蜜愛　　吾倆婚後三個月，感情甚濃，致房事無虛夕，大有比翼之鳥，連理之枝之槪。不料因縱慾過度，固有之性能，逐漸喪失，時被早洩或陰萎所窘，故愛情雖濃，力不從心奈何，乃設法治療，服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』頓覺偉全無比，早洩，陰萎，一掃而空。自知縱慾之害，故現特別攝生矣（明恥）美容與生育達到健美和姙娠之路  香港大學醫科學士吳大超　　那一種婦女可算是最幸福的呢？生着清秀的容貌，皮膚上顯着紅潤的血色，肌肉結實豐腴，曲線明顯，胸前高聳着一對彈性的乳峯，愉快明朗的姿態和神情，處處都令人心醉；更帶了個活潑健壯的孩子，在她身旁跳跳蹝蹝，這不是一個理想的婦女的曲型嗎？　　沒有那種合乎時代的健美，結婚數年還沒有一個愛的結晶，這是婦女的兩大缺憾，不過這兩件事總是不肯分開的。健康的婦女，發育得良好，我們是她強健豐腴，乳峯高聳，她生殖腺的內分泌一定合乎常態。乳癟失健，枯瘦萎黃的女子，每有月經不調，白帶多量之病，生殖腺的內分泌失去常態，所以多有不姙症。　　據此而論，我們可知若能使生殖腺壯健，發育定可良好，萎癟的乳峯可以變為高聳，瘦瘠之軀可轉而豐腴，月經可得調整，排出的卵子活潑有力，那麼健美和姙娠都可獲得。要達到強壯生殖腺的目的，可內服女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，卽可得到上述的效果。至於常和經期紊亂相伴的白帶病，旣足以殺死精蟲，又足使　道污穢發炎，須自行外用『療帶靈』，如白帶有淋毒，宜並服黃色素伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』自療常識治療腰背酸痛症的先決問題  周笑涵醫師　　腰背酸痛一症，為吾人引為最感威脅的疾病。蓋每有職業界中人，受本症所累，而蒙到無窮的損失。此誠數見不鮮的事實。　　當本症爆發之妝，每感精力衰退，不能從事於持久的工作。同時骨節酸楚。如兩足及兩肩膀，及腰背等處，尤為其侵害之大本營。關於促成本症的原因，不外為瘋濕內蘊，及血份不潔。平時如寒暖不常，則易被瘋濕所侵。如荒淫無度，身患淋濁，則易致血份不潔。治療之法。先決問題，必須對症下藥。譬如平時體力孱弱者，如能服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』培補體力，則抵抗力旺盛，本症不易爆發。直至由醖釀而發作，則同時應服『強期登氏骨痛片』以治之。每能迅速見愈，且愈後永可不發。原因由於該骨痛片確具袪瘋，除濕，消血及預防動脈硬化之四大功力。不過患者患淋病，或未愈者，或外表已愈者，則必須用黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』掃除殘留於體內的淋毒，使血份澈底清潔。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言「帶着眼淚的微笑」是健康的  劍平　　十九日「談言」，史楫君在叙述了「如何援綏」以後說：「帶着眼淚的微笑」！對的，我非常同意史君，以及「談言」上好幾位朋友的「援綏」的輿論，而且要加以補充。我們的「抗敵戰」，確是「帶着眼淚的微笑」，而這「微笑」並不因爲「帶着眼淚」便軟弱的，反之，却是「强硬」的，「健康」的。我們所「帶着」的「眼淚」是那容忍了這近百年來的恥辱的「眼淚」，也是我們一時興奮和覺悟過來，從黑暗中摸出了一綫光明的無限喜樂的所急出來的「眼淚」這些「眼淚」决不是酸辛的也不是傷感的。這便是我特別要提出來說的地方。現在，黑暗的氛圍已給我們打破了，我們已摸着了一綫光明，但我們决不能孤守着這「一綫光明」而滿足，我們將以我們的熱血，我們的生命來擴展這「一錢光明」，以至我們完全踏進那光明的世界。從最近「援綏運動」的風起雲湧的盛極一時的情景來看，我們相信我們向這一途徑的努力是完全可靠的，眞理在我們最後的勝利當然也是我們的。那麽，雖則是「帶着眼淚的微笑」，但我們是非常樂觀的。無論對於我們的前途，無論對於成功與失敗，我們都應該非常樂觀，持之以恒地長足地邁進着。　　這幾天捷報是接二連三地飛來了。我們試想，這些捷報是僥倖的嗎？不。那是由於四萬五千萬的人民上下一心地，發動那廣大而且普遍的援綏運動所激發的軍心，一鼓作氣擊退敵軍的。換句話說，以全國人民作後盾的抗敵戰，是無敵的，必勝的，所以，只要我們四萬五千萬同胞都齊心抗敵，我們是樂觀的。而此次本市各報的擴大宣傳的功績，也是不可磨滅的。　　由於此次援綏運動獲得普遍的進行，我們更樂觀於我民族之未死，「中華男兒還是獅子，並非棉羊」。只要誰眞爲國家，人民是無不擁護的，都願意「踴躍捐輸」的。正如史楫君說「卽使要論功行賞，也須看在整個救亡運動中的功績如何而定」，在抗敵戰中，一切私人恩怨均已泳消瓦解，一致對外了。　　同時，從捷報中獲得的敎訓是：只有反攻才可以獲勝。一日不絕根，禍患還是無窮的，小勝我們不必太高興，因爲我們的捷報應該是永久的。但要這樣，我們却非持久我們的「援綏運動」不行。一切倡導，贊助這一運動的同胞，我們應該怎樣更樂觀地爲持續這一運動，和把這一運動更爲普遍化呵！號聲  斯全　　黃昏時候，有一隊衣衫襤褸的兵士開來，駐紮在附近的廟宇裏。第二天早上我就被吹號的聲音驚醒。天色還沒有發白，就躺在床上聽吹號。開始是響亮而高亢的，漸漸地低弱下來，幾乎聲嘶力竭的樣子。後來竟是泣不成聲了。於是我冥想着：那吹號的或許是個小號兵，他剛在學習。這樣想着，眼前就站着一個年輕的兵士，他面壁而立，昻着首，鼓起他的發紅的腮膀，號子的聲音就那樣斷斷續續從牆壁上打回來。在冬日的侵晨，使我想起一個故事來了。　　有一年，我還在小學校讀書的時候，縣裏捉到了一個江洋大盜。經過了幾番審問，在一個大雪的早晨，城牆上貼出鎗斃的告示了。這消息鬨動了全城，因爲這縣城裏的入從來沒有看見過鎗斃。那個江洋大盜是有省裏的訓令，恐他路上脫逃，就令就地正法。　　一淸早，大家撑着雨傘，拖着釘鞋，在風勢最猛的城門洞裏等犯人，因爲這裏是犯人遊街必經之地。我同着幾個小朋友，也東穿西躥地混在人堆裏，其實那時候還不知道鎗斃是活活打死一個人的刑律。大家喊着「看槍斃」，而且看的人竟是全城出勁，總以爲是像看戲一樣的新玩意兒</p>

<p>這一天的雪眞大，每個人的肩胛上都堆起了厚厚的雪花，才聽見一陣繼續的號聲從城裏傳來。於是倦縮在城門洞裏的人羣又騷動起來，有幾個還迎上一條路去，怕恐犯人從他們頭上飛過逃去城外似的。我們生得太矮，就攀着一家店舖的門板，從大人的耳朵旁邊望到前面去，但是前面的人一幌動，就什麽都看不見了　然而犯入倒底是怎樣的在心裏更熱烈地猜測着，後來竟不顧一切危險，攀到板門的頂上。店舖的伙計也都擠出了階台，沒有人注意到我們幾個小孩子。　　在板門頂上果然看得很淸楚，開首是一個執旗的兵士，背面就是號手，一個年紀很靑的小號兵，他鼓起發紅的腮膀，吹着，聲音是那樣低弱而凄泣，彷彿他要走不動路的樣子。再後面是十六個負槍的兵士，分前後把犯入挾在中間　　於是我看淸楚犯人的樣子了。犯人是個年輕的男子，上身半裸着，有一條鎖鏈穿在他的頸間「琵琶骨」上。據說那是最厲害的刑具，任何是什麽江洋大盜，穿上了「琵琶骨」就一點辦法也沒有了。他面色慘白，或許他受不住冷氣侵蝕的關係，讓雪花積到皮肉上化了水珠掛到胸前去。有時從「琵琶骨」旁掛下來，就變做緋紅的血水了。他低着頭，看着自己脚上巨大的鐵繚，走路時就像鐘擺似的搖擺着，而且那樣遲慢，許多跟在犯人後面的觀衆都搶過了前頭又漸漸落後去。他們或許從縣門口就跟來的，有一個聲音在說：「眞是殺坯！剛才還哭着喊着寃枉，殺人放火時候能想着這般卞塲就好了！」於是聽的入有的搖頭，有的切齒，表示他們的憫憐，他們的憤怒。終於大家推着擠着出城到荒地「看搶斃」去了。　　但是我在爬下板門的時候，被家裏人拉回了，說是看槍斃要被寃魂附身的。我家的廚子就看了那犯人在地上扭動着到絕氣才回來。他也是駡那犯人是殺坯！臨跪着還裝腔做勢喊靑天大老爺寃枉！　　後來相隔了七八年，又捉到了一個「正身」的江洋大盜，從前槍斃的那個由第二個犯人供出來確是寃枉的，他不過在盜窩裏帮做幾天工，他自然沒有知道主人是江洋大盜。　　這故事藏在我心的深處已經有卅多年了，現在又被那低弱的號聲喚起來了。我終於在床上坐起，讓那個穿「琵琶骨」的影子在我眼前浮盪着。我想人死後眞有鬼的話，他的寃魂一定不散的。　　那吹號的聲音直到天色發亮才停止了。我就穿了衣服踱到那廟宇的山門前，想懇求那個號兵明天吹悲壯的調子。但是他們已經開板了。風雪的旅途  尤其　　雪撲着臉，正是嚴寒的結冰時候。原野上，除了枯樹敗草以外，零落的茅屋在風雪里顫抖抖。　　讓津沽支錢的短程火車拖上奔往海口去的路，車子里沒有幾個人，有的把身子靠在壁角的車板上昏沈的睡着，弔在車頂上的電燈，幽暗得分不出對面的人臉。窗縫里或者門開處掃下了不能抵禦的寒風，由玻璃窗望出去，除了偶爾的有幾盞鬼火樣的燈光，漆暗，吞食着整個的平原上。　　應該感謝的是起身的時候，天津客棧里陪送」搭船的那個堂倌，年紀雖不根大，而「世故的槍刺倒刺滿了他的全身，語氣總是投合着客人的心意，他說航海的船隻在這條綫上要停靠幾次，當「暈船」的時候，旅人們該有怎樣的準備，甚至船在泊到碼頭前應該如何的多加小心，……這些，都足以表示他經騐的幹練，時間，就在這不經意的閒談里溜走了。　　到了塘沽的車站，他招呼着船上的伙夫把行李點交給他們，然後，呌我們跟隨着跨上寬闊的又生疏的碼頭。自然，等於逃難的我們，是沒有什麽金錢乘坐「高等之艙」的，連通艙的待遇都認爲有莫大的榮幸。起先，行李是擺在中間的，多承伙夫的照顧，還拿了幾張蓆子舖在冰冷堅硬的鐵板上，這照顧雖則在事後才使我知道也須有相常的代價，但當時，我總覺得人類是具有互助的善心的，於是，在心底揚起了銘風的蕩漾。　　外面有片聲響，伙夫的搶奪，旅客的嘈雜，和裝貨的忙碌。　　一轉眼，離我們不遠的貨艙打開了，從舷板上下來幾個人呼喝着，喉嚨多洪亮，把音波傳到每一個角落去—快祖來，裝貨嘍，讓開，—快快！　　跟着，首先受到影響的，又是我們這一攤，那堂倌的眼色怪銳利的，把嘴一努，六七個人走過來，這一攤很快的移到靠北面的那一頭去，結果，他臉上的笑表演得異常的精彩，企望着能得到一個滿意的酬勞，經過了幾次的唇舌，不，可以說爭執，才以四元錢的代價買回了他恨恨地幾雙白眼。　　舖蓋打開了，心里想，讓我們有個舒適的睡眠吧，這些夜的疲勞！　　挨着我們地舖的，是幾位出遊碼頭的伶工，睡在那面被筒里的，是兩個年靑的女人，招呼「行頭」的男子則睡在較遠的一面，那老頭子也許是前台的總管吧？把呢帽遮住了眼睛，坐在我們兩方舖位的當中，身子縮成了一團。　　由幽暗的一個角落里，走過來一個小厮，許多舖位都喊他「阿毛」，怪殷勤的，替這個舖位冲茶，又　　　　　小吃之類，看來他是這里的一個茶房，於是，我們也買了些東西裝下肚子，然後把被頭蒙了腦袋擋着邪風的侵犯睡他個暢快。　　沒有多少時間，意外的吵鬧震醒了全艙的旅客，失竊！失竊！刺上了每個人的心窩，搜索，翻騰，忙成了一團，多僥倖呵！我們兩個舖位都無恙。之後，由於那男子的告訴，這無恙，不是沒有來由的，前台總管的坐位發生了莫大的效能，使一般「君子」沒有敢下手。當我向他致謝的時候，對方好像失去了感覺，男子在笑，女人也在笑，呵！他那里是什麽總管呢？深度的眼疾使他失掉睡眠的享受，爲了怕那微柔的燈光，帽子是必須遮在臉上的，這些，君子們又怎能知道呢？　　潮水在漲，黑絨的天幕染了點銀灰，看看快開船了。阿毛又小心的走過來，誇耀着天津的「葉黎」相當的有名，而且，在海航的富於鹹性的海水里，是不可缺少的東西，手里，還拿了幾種樣子在推銷着，這樣鈔票紛紛地送到他的掌心，然後，他仍舊殷勤的邁着勁快的步子上去了。　　鑼聲嚮了，一遍，兩遍，船也轉動了方向，但阿毛却始終沒有回來，欺騙的把戲吶！　　碎冰船拖了雄偉的船身，衝破堅厚的冰層，走着，緩慢的，在灰白的天色里，離開了靜臥着的碼頭。圖書館裏  阿敏作行  陳里昻　　夜很深了，這前樓面裏的人家還沒有睡，樓板不時發出可咚可咚的脚步聲，間又夾着羅老太嗡嗡不淸的話語，除掉這些聲息之外，又是寂然。前後鄰居也不以爲異，羅老太三天前已經說過；她兒子有了生意，老東家呌他上四川去，可是這地方多遠呵，去了就難得回來，盤費貴得嚇天。她捨不得放她兒子出遠門，假使去了，等於沒有這個兒子。上了年紀的人總想到死」這層上去，本來末，羅老太打算同媳婦一家子搬去四川，但又怕兒子初上生意，力量够不上，位子是否牢靠，更難說，而且她死了三年的丈夫，墳葬在蘇州老家，想自己也是日落西山的人了，一早百老歸天，在那遼遠的客省運一口材回來併穴是不輕容易的，她見過好多同鄉在遠方死了，棺材　不　　……　　這許多疑難，羅老太曾同好多鄰居商酌過，可是誰都，嗯嗯唔唔沒一句誠懇的心腹話。實在也難怪，這勢口誰家沒有難處，誰沒有滿腔心事，自家沒法子解决困難的時侯，還有什麽心思給別人算計呢。不是嗎，住在樓下側廂裏的阿崑爸聽說羅老太的見子找到生意，更爲自己的失業而焦急得吒血了。他對羅老太說：「你要留他在家裏帮着吃飯嗎，你是什麽算計，我眞呌找不到生意，要是有那麽十塊八塊錢的缺分，在天邊也得趕去的！」　　這雖是比較確切的激勵　，可是在正被骨肉之情縈繞着的羅老太聽來，似乎是一些硬心腸的說法，而邁老的心坎中更加上一層哀愁的薄膜。　　生活的颶風誰也抵禦不了的，母子，夫妻……它要衝散你的時候，沒有法子，只好分離，祗有各人抹一把眼淚，甚至，連抹眼淚也來不及。羅老太要不放她兒子成行，事實已屬不可能。東家的船票早送來了，光是這一筆損失，就賠償不起，何况，前些日子，連封的航空信，千求萬求，總算沒落空，到嘴的飯碗不去捧，餓死了還得被入家說輕悄話的。大家乾拚在一塊，早遲總不是結局。骨肉團聚，只有不愁吃着的人家才可享這個福。　　媳婦已把鋪蓋網好了，正在用繩縛那隻壞了銅環的皮箱時，明瓦天長上忽然發出淅淅瀝瀝的聲音，兒子顯出輕微的驚愕：「下雨嗎」，便又底下頭去，十五支光的電燈灑着淡黃的光茫落在他新剪頭髮的後腦杓，照成一片憂鬱的靑色。羅老太擠箍着眼睛摒息留神傾聽：「眞的下雨了。」她又蹩到兒子身邊，「天下雨，明早不能走吧……那麽，就搭下班船走，差幾天……不碍吧，你看…？」兒子又抬起頭來：「下雨是不妨事的，好在重慶上岸就是，不比要起旱路，而且，這雨也不至於會下個十天半月的。」　　媳婦剛想停手，却又使出勁兒來了其實羅老太也自知那話是多餘說話的，她心坎中總想兒子能在自己面前多出現幾天，也是莫大的安慰，因此，深願天時的轉變能留住了。「早遲總得要走的啊　」這句話從兒子嘴裏脫出的時候，頓把羅老太從迷惑中擊醒回來。在昏花的老眼前重顯出生活的巨魔揑着銳刺鋼鞭正向兒子，向媳婦，向自己厲聲呼喝：「走呀！走呀！」……　　屋子外面又刮風了，「呼呼呼呼……」，明瓦天窗上的雨聲更大，電燈的光芒在羅老太的眼前，在媳婦的眼前，在兒子的眼前，更顯得黯淡。「這是發冷汛的天啦，棉衣服要全帶着走的，你聽見了沒有，他的棉衣服統給打在包袱裏，出門出路的……」羅老太嘮叨地可嚀着媳婦：「你把公阿爹的那件舊呢大衣亦放進去，遮遮風寒也好，唉唉，你們年輕人做事總想不到。」中　　可是，媳婦却在半邊嗚咽了，兒子和衣躺在舖上。　　「咦，你這女娘兒可眞不懂事，唉唉，丈夫出門出路得討個吉利呵，哭什麽呢？你年輕，早遲總要一塊去的……哭什麽呢？：」可是，羅老太自己昏花的老　却也</p>

<h3 id="e1">Li Shou-hsin's Bandit Troops Attack Hsingho Yesterday and are Repelled; Battle Enters New Phase; Mongol Troops Concentrated at Pailingmiao; Our Troops Heavily Deployed Along Kueihua-Paotou Line <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Changchiakou) On the morning of the 22nd, Li Shou-hsin commanded bandit-puppet troops at Nanchaochien, attacking Hsingho again, supported by airplanes and tanks. They were repelled by the Sui army. Subsequently, over a thousand Jehol troops arrived as reinforcements. Li planned to wait for reinforcements to arrive within days and then attack again, anticipating fierce fighting around Hsingho. Wang Ying's unit of over three thousand men departed Shangtu for Huanpei on the 22nd, to join over ten thousand Mongol troops already there, flanking the Sui army, extending the front line, and using bandit-puppet troops elsewhere for guerrilla warfare to distract Sui forces and allow entry into the Hetao region. Sixty carts of coal and grain were transported from Changpei to Shangtu-Nanchaochien on the 22nd. Over a thousand Jehol troops newly arrived from Kuyuan, with another two thousand en route, will proceed to Nanchaochien as reinforcements. Twelve villages west of Nanchaochien were burned by the bandits. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kueihua) No changes occurred in Suipei on the 22nd. Hongkortu was also peaceful on the 22nd. Wang Ying has been reorganizing his remnants, planning another attempt. Bandit airplanes dropped bombs on villages along the border of Hsingho on the 22nd, but fortunately, there were no casualties. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) A telegram from Chining reports that the war in Sueitung has entered a new phase. The bandit army's strategy is gradually changing, and the future is unpredictable. A reporter went to the front lines on the 21st to investigate, encountering Division Commander Peng Yu-bin convening a meeting of officers to discuss defensive works and give instructions. The area east of Hongkortu is the main battlefield for this fierce battle, and the atmosphere in the villages and towns is filled with wartime tension. Military transportation and deployment appear rushed. Local order is still good. Hongkortu has been bombed several times by bandit airplanes, and many important buildings have been damaged. Over sixty bombs were dropped near the Catholic Church, but fortunately, the building is sturdy, with only slight damage to the outer gate. Bandit corpses litter the fields near our army's defense line outside the town, and have not yet been buried. Wang Ying's puppet headquarters was originally located in Tala Village, but later moved to Chinshihchengzi. After our army captured it on the 18th, Wang led his remnants and fled to Shangtu. The puppet regimental commander was killed in action, and the elite troops of the puppet First Brigade, Shi Lin's unit, defected. Almost all of their elite troops were lost. We captured dozens of boxes of military supplies as spoils of war, all of which were crude and unusable. Due to the inconvenience of transport, they were burned. Wang suffered a major injury and needs time to reorganize. We found orders issued by Wang within the bandit army's headquarters, revealing that the puppet First Army departed Shangtu on the 15th, planning to bypass Kaokiachen to take the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway.

According to sources from Kueihua, the situation on the front lines of Sueitung remained quite quiet yesterday.

<p>(Tientsin) The puppet East Hopei government decided to hold a one-year anniversary celebration on the 25th, and formulated a puppet government flag, usurping our abolished five-color flag as the puppet state emblem. A new auditorium is being built at a cost of 600,000 yuan, with a capacity of 8,000 people. Li Hai-tien, the former commander of the puppet East Hopei Security Corps, is hiding in Tientsin and is still secretly plotting with Chih Tsung-mo, the secretary-general of the puppet East Hopei government, to overthrow Yin Ju-keng. While Chih appears respectful on the surface, he is secretly inciting Li's old subordinates in the 3rd Security Corps of Changli, planning to stage an uprising in Tangshan-Changli on the 25th during the puppet anniversary celebration. Yin has received secret reports and is secretly monitoring Chih. Infighting within the puppet organization is intensifying.</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Mutinying troops from Changli fled to the mountains in Luan County on the 22nd. Parts of the puppet 3rd and 4th Security Corps are currently surrounding them. Japanese troops who went to suppress them were unable to attack and returned to Tientsin on the evening of the 22nd.</p>

The names of these two Japanese have reportedly been identified. One is Hirai, the head of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Tangshan, and the other is Sakurai of the East Hopei Security Team. It is said that when the first unit mutinied, Sakurai mediated a peaceful resolution, but suddenly on Friday, over four hundred members of the unit mutinied again, robbing all the passengers on the Beining No. 44 passenger-freight train, and kidnapping two Japanese and six railway police officers, disembarking at Kuli, east of Tangshan, and fleeing inland. This mutiny of the security team is reportedly due to Chao Lei's resentment after being dismissed by Yin Ju-keng. (22nd Reuter's Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanking) Teng Ku, a standing member of the Central Antiquities Association, and members Chen Nien-chung, Tung Tso-pin, and others, went to Kaifeng to survey antiquities and returned to Nanking on the afternoon of the 22nd after completing their tasks. According to Teng, after arriving in Kaifeng and contacting the political and military authorities, they went to Lungmen in Loyang to survey the site, which is a famous stone chamber of statues. In the past, personnel were repeatedly dispatched to survey the extent of the damage. Chiang Kai-shek recently ordered repairs, and construction is about to begin. This time, an agreement was reached with Honan Province on technical facilities and detailed registration plans for permanent preservation methods. Subsequently, they traveled through Kingyong City and the Chiushan area, investigating the illegal excavation of underground antiquities. The area contains very rich artifacts from the Shang, Chou, Han, Wei, Sui, Tang, Sung, and Yuan dynasties, which are important materials for studying the history of previous dynasties. Because of repeated large-scale illegal excavations and sales, a system of prevention and strict handling has now been commercially formulated. If the artifacts of our ancestors can be collected for viewing, and the national consciousness can be instilled in the general public, then even the bandits in eastern Suiyuan, impressed by the greatness of the works of previous generations, will feel regret in their hearts and will not be exploited by others. In order to achieve the above two tasks, in accordance with the intentions of the central government, an office will be established in Loyang, with members Chuan Lei and technicians Ching Lin-yen stationed in Loyang to work. Many antiquities have been unearthed in Loyang over the years, and many have been smuggled out of the country or lost, resulting in a great cultural loss, due to the lack of a preservation agency. In recent years, various parties have requested that the central government establish an antiquities exhibition hall for management in the area. We plan to draft a plan immediately and advise the central government. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce considers that the mutual aid societies previously organized in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shaanxi, and other provinces to handle agricultural relief and agricultural loan organizations, and the cooperative preparatory societies organized in the bandit suppression areas to handle rural financial relief, all have the function of credit cooperatives in nature, and their organization is simple and management is convenient. In places where cooperatives are not yet popular and the economy is extremely difficult, they are indeed a factual necessity. However, these organizations have no legal basis, and their names are inconsistent, and monitoring and assessment are difficult. In order to coordinate, the Ministry has formulated eleven provisional measures for handling mutual aid societies in various provinces, detailing all the procedures for the establishment of mutual aid societies, and attaching the articles of association of mutual aid societies, which are issued to the competent authorities of various provinces and cities for compliance. All previously established cooperatives should still be allowed to continue to exist. In the future, if such organizations are needed, they should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the provisional measures to achieve standardization.

<h3 id="e38">Basic Understanding of the Sino-Japanese Problem (Part 1) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xianwen</p>
<p>— After reading Mr. Yamazaki Yasuzumi's "Anti-Japanese China" —</p>
<p>In September of this year, Mr. Yamazaki Yasuzumi, a famous Japanese economist, traveled to China and arrived in Shanghai via the Jinpu Railway from Beiping. I did not know Mr. Yamazaki originally, but one day I was introduced to him by a friend and had a brief meeting. At that time, he immediately expressed his hope to hear the opinions of Chinese economists in Shanghai who opposed Japan. He repeatedly stated that this trip was purely a personal action and had nothing to do with the Japanese authorities. He requested that the conversation be free and that we did not need to be polite to each other. Therefore, two days later, I introduced a certain gentleman who advocated "resistance against Japan to save the country" to meet him. Firstly, because they were talking very vigorously, I couldn't interrupt. Secondly, because I knew that I was just a scholar and even if I had opinions, I couldn't represent any party. Therefore, regarding the Sino-Japanese problem, I didn't express anything that day. The next day, Mr. Yamazaki left Shanghai for Beijing and then returned to his country.</p>
<p>Now, he sent me a magazine from Tokyo, which contains his great work. The title is printed in red ink and is called "Anti-Japanese China." The article is over ten thousand words long and describes his experiences, what he heard, and what he felt during this trip to China. According to him: the anti-Japanese sentiment in China is indeed better on the surface than in the past, but in essence, it is more profound than in the past. It has gone through "three stages" of development, and now it has turned from anti-Japanese sentiment of the Fascist front to anti-Japanese sentiment of the People's Front. He also said that he met many famous people from all walks of life in China. Among them were "China's Gorky" Mr. Lu Xun, "brave general of the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement" Mr. Zhang Naiqi, "senior Chinese educator" Mr. Huang Yanpei, and Mr. Pan Gongzhan. In addition, he also met Mr. Xu Xinliu, Mr. Fu Sinian, Mr. Ma Yinchu, Mr. Chu Fucheng, Mr. Xiao Tongzi, Mr. Cheng Cangbo, Mr. Luo Jialun, Mr. Hu Zhengzhi, and discussed the Sino-Japanese problem and heard their "high opinions."</p>
<p>However, the "high opinions" of these many famous people from all walks of life on the Sino-Japanese problem are obviously not very similar. He used a method of concealing their names, saying that "a certain gentleman" told him, "It is best for Japan to develop towards Southeast Asia and not attack China." This is like saying: since the robber has entered the door, please let him attack the neighbors next door. The Chinese, who claim that China is a country of etiquette, don't even know Confucius's clear instruction "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." No wonder Mr. Yamazaki wants to "conceal his name." In fact, "please develop towards Southeast Asia," why does "a certain gentleman" need to instruct this? Japanese imperialism has long listed Southeast Asia as one of its "development" targets, and it is already proceeding step by step. May I ask: what does Japanese imperialism really love about China? Why would it abandon the easy and attack the difficult, not "develop" in Southeast Asia, which is easier to obtain, but attack China, which has complicated relationships? Taking a step back, even if Japanese imperialism can accept the "certain gentleman"'s instruction and abandon China for Southeast Asia, saying that Japan can do without China after obtaining Southeast Asia is just a dream of those who do not understand the "nature of imperialist foreign expansion." What is certain is that "Mr. Fu Sinian of the Academia Sinica" told him that "Japan is indeed overpopulated, and China also suffers from overpopulation, and its resources are also very weak. Even if there are some resources, it is not easy to develop them." This is like saying: the robber has entered the door and is pleading bitterly. Although it is a bit more enlightened than the "using neighbors as a barrier" argument of a certain gentleman, it is also quite pitiful. Therefore, Mr. Yamazaki has the impression of "please don't set your sights on China, Japan." In fact, I once said at a Sino-Japanese problem symposium convened by the Shen Bao that the so-called "overpopulation" is just an excuse for Japan's foreign aggression. Japan's current foreign aggression is due to the overabundance of products rather than overpopulation. Looking back, Japan launched the September 18th Incident under the name of overpopulation and successively occupied the four northeastern provinces of China, but so far five years have passed, and the facts prove that very few Japanese have moved to the northeast. If we truly believe that Japan's foreign aggression is due to its need to address overpopulation, and also believe that China's overpopulation can truly be addressed through foreign aggression (please note this major premise), then no matter how bitterly Mr. Fu Sinian pleads and says that "China also suffers from overpopulation, and its resources are also very weak," I am afraid there is still no sufficient reason to reject Japan's aggression. The so-called "weakness" is originally the antonym of abundance, and is a relative term. If we have no way to prove that Japan's resources are indeed richer than China's, or that China's resources are indeed weaker than Japan's (at least that China's resources are as weak as Japan's), then China is still a target for Japanese aggression. Didn't Mr. Fu continue to say that China "even if there are some resources, it is not easy to develop them"? Good! China has some resources, but it is not easy to develop them. At the same time, all the resources that Japan has are almost developed, so Japan may as well come and help China develop these resources that are not easy to develop. The robber has entered the door, and if we say that our home is also very poor, and even if my wife has some gold jewelry in her hand, it is not easy to take it out, using these words to deal with the robber, apart from expressing a pitiful appearance, there is really no sufficient reason to refuse the robber's robbery. To be honest, China's resources are not few, at least not fewer than Japan's. But Japan definitely cannot invade China just because China has more resources. Moreover, Japan's so-called overpopulation is a "complete" lie.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the opinion of "senior Chinese educator" Mr. Huang Yanpei, who told Mr. Yamazaki: "There is a saying in Shanghai called 'poisoning a tiger to death after eating arsenic.' If Japan, the tiger, really wants the lives of the Chinese people, then the Chinese people will eat the arsenic of communism and fight to the death together." Mr. Huang's opinion, which carries a bit of threat, is obviously "stronger" ten thousand times than the "using neighbors as a barrier" argument of a certain gentleman and the pleading argument of Mr. Fu. Because of this, Mr. Huang's relatively "tough" opinion has obviously aroused considerable attention from Mr. Yamazaki. Therefore, Mr. Yamazaki said: In China, "there is a pro-Russian consciousness hidden within the anti-Japanese consciousness. This is something Japan should consider most." Furthermore, he said: "Looking at the big picture, China's fate will either incline towards Japan or towards Soviet Russia. But at this time, it is not only a crisis for the Chinese government, but also a major crisis for Japan." And the final conclusion is: "If Japan does not first establish a theory and method on how to make China and Japan coexist and prosper in a fair and collaborative manner, then Japan will be in danger of being defeated by Soviet Russia." Of course, "poisoning a tiger to death after eating arsenic" is a passive measure of last resort. However, strictly speaking, these words still carry a threatening tone, and the real hope is still that Japan, the tiger, can "leave a way for the people." If we think that arsenic is a poison (premise), and the purpose of eating it is only to passively poison the tiger to death, then it is not necessary. It is better to use a little bit of strength to resist the tiger. What we want to strive for is not to poison the death of others with our own death, but how to escape from death. If unfortunately, we are also willing to use the last bit of strength to eat arsenic and fight the tiger to death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the opinion of "brave general of the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement" Mr. Zhang Naiqi, who told Mr. Yamazaki, "Our proposal is only to resist Japan, not to exclude Japan." "What we want to fight against is Japanese imperialism or Japanese aggression, definitely not Japan or the Japanese people." With such a bright and upright declaration, Mr. Yamazaki of course expressed his approval, so he always said: "First: I have no objection to the Chinese people fighting against imperialism... but I am afraid that the Chinese government cannot fight imperialism thoroughly." "Second: China's anti-Japanese sentiment is of course hoped to succeed, but after success, how will it be built?" Most of the answers from Chinese celebrities to these two questions are "looking around and talking about other things." But these two questions are the central argument of Mr. Yamazaki's "Anti-Japanese China," and I will briefly discuss them as far as my limited knowledge allows. However, due to various reasons, I cannot speak my mind freely. Please readers "do not misinterpret the meaning due to the words."</p>

<h3 id="e39">How to Study Agricultural Disciplines (Part 1) <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Boyu, Professor of the College of Agriculture, Jinling University</p>
<p>(I) What is Called Agriculture?</p>
<p>People use labor to cultivate the land, adapting to the climate and terrain as appropriate and meeting local needs, to produce plants and animals for our use - selecting seeds, cultivating, protecting, managing, and distributing agricultural products are all agricultural activities. This comprehensive production technique based on land is collectively known as agriculture. We know that human emotions, perceptions, thoughts, or attitudes themselves cannot affect the growth of plants and animals. However, the formation of experience in agricultural technology is not only a technique but also knowledge combined from various causes and effects, and natural laws. This organized knowledge is agricultural science.</p>
<p>After reading the above, we can summarize by saying that agriculture is a cultivation and production enterprise that combines labor and land.</p>
<p>(II) What are the Characteristics of Agriculture?</p>
<p>Although agriculture is a production enterprise like industry and commerce, it has many unique limitations. Here, we will mention one or two of the most significant ones:</p>
<p>(1) Agriculture Depends on Land; Without Land, There is No Agriculture. The cultivation of all crops entirely requires land. Even animal husbandry and sericulture, on the surface, seem unrelated to land, but their feed, like pasture and mulberry leaves, grows on land. Furthermore, the fertility of the land and the allocation of land are directly related to agriculture. Therefore, land is one of the most essential elements of agricultural production.</p>
<p>(2) Agriculture Contains Regionality. The amount of rainfall, the temperature, the soil's composition and fertility, the slope and flatness of the terrain, the length of sunshine, and the climate's temperature all directly impact agricultural production. However, conditions vary from place to place, so agricultural organization also varies. The agriculture of area A may not be suitable for area B, European and American agriculture may not be suitable for China, and the agriculture of northern and southern China differs greatly.</p>
<p>(3) Agriculture Contains Seasonality. The germination, flowering, fruiting, and all management of agricultural plants must follow the changing seasons and cannot be shortened or advanced. Although some people are working to try to advance or extend the growing season, the effect is minimal and will not be universally adopted. Therefore, agricultural improvement will never be as rapid as in industry and commerce.</p>
<p>(III) Agricultural Vocational Education</p>
<p>Before discussing this issue, we must first understand what vocational education is. Education is an enterprise that aims to comprehensively solve life's problems. However, life's demands vary in different aspects and nature, so the methods of development also differ. Vocational education is essentially ordinary education, but after the division of labor, the knowledge and skills required for various occupations must be specialized. Only in the context of community life can there be occupations. Therefore, vocational education can be said to adapt to the needs of society, cultivate vocational talents with specialized skills, produce what others need through specialized activities, and indirectly seek one's own needs. As for what agricultural vocational education is, it uses specialized methods or techniques to maintain or produce the growth of plants and animals, directly providing raw materials for society, and indirectly seeking a fulfilling life for agricultural producers. Therefore, all education related to agriculture, such as farming, sericulture, forestry, animal husbandry, aquaculture, horticulture, agricultural product manufacturing, and rural cooperation, is called agricultural education. Therefore, we know that there are many occupations in society, and the nature of each occupation is different. Therefore, vocational education must also be classified according to the nature of the occupation. Agricultural vocational education is one type of vocational education, but the training of students focuses entirely on agricultural disciplines and skills.</p>
<p>(IV) The Purpose and Scope of Agricultural Education</p>
<p>This point can be discussed from three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) The Purpose and Scope of Elementary School Agricultural Education. The purpose of elementary school agricultural education is not to cultivate a good farmer but to enable children to have a correct and broad understanding of the natural environment and the relationship between nature and humans. At the same time, it aims to generate children's interest in agriculture and foster sympathy and respect for farmers' lives and work. At the very least, it should enable children to have a considerable understanding of subjects such as plants and livestock, which is a basic preparation for entering secondary agricultural schools in the future. Therefore, the implementation of elementary school agricultural education, in addition to more observation and practice, should also include both successful and failed practices, with mutual comparisons, as the basis for clear and experimental teaching.</p>
<p>(2) The Purpose and Scope of Agricultural Colleges. Agricultural colleges are the highest academic institutions for agricultural research. They should conduct in-depth research on various agricultural issues. Therefore, they should conduct in-depth research on surveying agriculture, studying agricultural sciences, and the fundamental issues of agricultural management. At the same time, they must also focus on experimentation and design, as well as the study of agricultural theory.</p>
<p>(3) The Purpose and Scope of Secondary Agricultural Schools. Secondary agricultural schools are intermediate between agricultural colleges and elementary schools, so their purpose is naturally different from the above two. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education: "The purpose of secondary agricultural schools is to cultivate talents capable of independently managing various agricultural activities; farm technicians; agricultural instructors; personnel for agricultural cooperation, agricultural extension, rural improvement, and elementary school agriculture teachers." Therefore, secondary agricultural students must not only have a deep understanding and proficiency in the skills of various practical agricultural operations but also have a deep understanding of various undertakings in rural society. Their mental agility and physical health must be noted. These are the foundation and preparation for future service or further education.</p>
<p>(V) What Kind of Agricultural Vocational Education Do We Need?</p>
<p>The establishment of modern agricultural education in China dates back to the 22nd year of Guangxu. Although the education system has undergone many changes and the school names have been changed many times, the importance of agricultural education has not diminished. However, although agricultural schools have been increasing year by year, agricultural school graduates have no way out, and our country's agriculture has not made any progress. Is this because modern agricultural education is not suitable for the needs of our society, or is there no need to conduct agricultural education? Regarding this point, we must thoroughly understand the factors that led to the failure of agricultural education in the past. Mr. Zhang Zhiwen, an agricultural education expert, said: "The failure of agricultural education in the past was mainly due to the perfunctory and careless teaching. Students have not received practical training, so they have no ability to engage in specialized occupations. To fulfill its mission, secondary agricultural schools should first determine the specific guidelines for implementing agricultural education." Mr. Zhang is one of the few agricultural education experts in the country and has been engaged in agricultural education for many years, so he naturally has a unique perspective on this point. Therefore, he also has the following views on the implementation of agricultural education in China in the future: A. Secondary schools in each rural area of the province should solve their specialized problems according to local needs. B. The curriculum should be adapted to the needs of the local area. C. The number of students enrolled should be based on the number of agricultural talents needed in the school district. D. The talents cultivated should be allocated in a comprehensive manner. E. Survey the employment status of graduates as a basis for school improvement. F. Conduct supplementary education for out-of-school youth in the school district. In addition, the content of the school should be as substantial as possible, the farms should be as large as possible, the books should be as rich as possible, and the teachers must have both knowledge and ability. If those who run agricultural education in the future can truly follow Mr. Zhang's words and do it conscientiously, then I can say that the agricultural school graduates in the future will not have no way out, and the agriculture taught in the school will not be unable to establish a close relationship with society. In short, agricultural education in the future must be integrated with society, and students must have rich knowledge and experience, and be able to practice in the field. Only in this way can China's agricultural education fulfill its mission and embark on the road of agricultural revitalization.</p>
<p>(VI) Why Study Agriculture?</p>
<p>Regarding the purpose and scope of establishing agricultural departments in schools at all levels, we have discussed it roughly above. We will further discuss why modern secondary school students should study agriculture. This point can be discussed from several aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Agriculture Itself. Agriculture is a basic industry. Whether it is people's clothing, food, housing, transportation, all kinds of raw materials are directly and indirectly derived from agricultural products. Even if we want to revitalize industry, we have to improve agriculture. Because most of the raw materials in industry are taken from agricultural products. According to Professor Bu Kai of Jinling University, the total cultivated area in China is 1,578,000,000 mu. At least 350 million people directly depend on the land for their livelihoods, and more than 100 million people indirectly depend on the land to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, dividing the land by the total population, each person gets only three mu of land. Moreover, our natural population growth rate is very high. According to a survey by the Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University, it is 1.43%. If we estimate the total population of the country as 450 million, then the total population of the country will increase by 6.4 million people within a year. We see such population pressure, and we can only solve it by improving agriculture. Furthermore, we have been using the land for more than 4,000 years, and the fertility of the land has been almost exhausted. If we do not engage in active cultivation, it is really difficult to maintain it. Therefore, we should study agriculture so that agricultural technology progresses day by day, farmers' knowledge increases day by day, people become richer day by day, and the country becomes stronger day by day. Then, we can compete with the world's powers and not be subjected to economic oppression.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Sino-British Continued Survey of the Yunnan-Burma Border <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The issue of surveying the undetermined section of the Sino-British Yunnan-Burma border has been delayed for forty years since 1897. Only on April 9th of last year did our government reach an agreement with Britain to form a border survey committee composed of two commissioners each from China and Britain, and one neutral commissioner appointed by the League of Nations, with the neutral commissioner as the chairman. The committee went to the undetermined section of the Yunnan-Burma border to conduct a joint survey. The committee was established in July, and on December 1st, our commissioners Liang Yugao and Yi Mingde, British commissioners Colegrave and Glass, and the neutral commissioner, Swiss national Islam, arrived at Huthsan to begin the survey. By April of this year, the work was suspended due to the arrival of the rainy season and the prevalence of miasma. Our commissioner Liang Yugao returned to Beijing to report. Now that the rainy season has passed, Commissioner Liang has set off again for Yunnan, intending to continue the survey from New Year's Day next year, and complete the entire survey before the rainy season. The long-pending border issue may be partially resolved as a result.</p>
<p>According to Article 3 of the Sino-British Burma Convention of 1886, "The Sino-Burmese border shall be jointly surveyed and demarcated by commissioners appointed by the two governments." Subsequently, China and Britain repeatedly sent high-ranking officials to survey and demarcate the boundary line. In 1894, our country and Britain concluded the Yunnan-Burma Border and Commerce Convention, consisting of twenty articles. In 1897, another Yunnan-Burma Border and Commerce Convention with nineteen supplementary articles was concluded with Britain. At that time, the survey personnel, ignorant of geography, mistakenly included the area outside the Hanlong, Tianma, Huju, and Tiebi Four Passes entirely into Burmese territory. In 1897, China and Britain again sent commissioners to survey the Yunnan-Burma border. What was surveyed at that time was the section starting from the northern tip of Gaoshan in Tengchong County, extending south and east to the Nam Pan River, a tributary of the Nam Ting River, in Zhenkang County. The areas north of the northern tip of Gaoshan, such as Pianma and Jiangxinpo, were not demarcated due to disputes between China and Britain. This is the undetermined northern section. As for the section from the Nam Ting River south to the Nam Ma River, a tributary of the Nam Ka River, in Lancang County, including the mineral-rich Ban Hong and Ximeng areas, the Qing government, according to the provisions of the Supplementary Articles to the Yunnan-Burma Border and Commerce Convention, sent Liu Wansheng and Chen Can in 1899, following the map line presented by Minister to Britain Xue Fucheng, to conduct a joint survey with British representative Scott. The boundary line proposed by the Xue map starts from the Nam Ting River, goes south along the mountain ridge, and follows Gongming Mountain to the place where the Nam Ma River flows into the Nam Ka River, placing the upper, middle, and lower Hulumu tribes of Ban Hong under the jurisdiction of Yunnan Province, and the areas belonging to Ban Zhu under the jurisdiction of Burma. At that time, Scott insisted that the latitude and longitude recorded in Xue's map and documents did not match, and produced another map, firmly insisting that the line should start from the Nam Ting River, go south and turn east, follow Kongming Mountain (an allusion to Gongming Mountain), and go to the Nam Ka River, placing Ban Hong and other places under the jurisdiction of Burma. The two sides argued endlessly and failed to demarcate the line. This is the undetermined southern section. What the current Sino-British Yunnan-Burma Border Survey Committee is surveying is this section of the boundary line.</p>
<p>The task of the Sino-British Yunnan-Burma Border Survey Committee is said to be to conduct on-the-ground surveys of geographical, political, and historical factors to determine the true meaning of the text of the Supplementary Articles to the Yunnan-Burma Border and Commerce Convention of 1897 as a reference for future demarcation. Political and historical factors are part of human geography and can indeed serve as important references for demarcation. However, we know that since 1897, the British have created many "faits accomplis" in the undetermined area. For example, in the Lancang area, the British have established more than 200 churches. Wherever churches are established, they form a special area that is not under the jurisdiction of our country. These situations increase the difficulty of demarcation. Therefore, we hope that the survey commissioners will strictly limit their research on political and historical factors to the facts before 1897; otherwise, this survey may still be delayed.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Anti-Communist Pact Concluded Between Germany and Japan; Relations Between Russia and Japan Become Tense; Soviet Union Announces Postponement of Signing of Fisheries Agreement; Negotiations on Various Pending Issues Will Be Affected <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Relations between the Soviet Union and Japan have recently shown signs of easing, but today news has emerged that the Soviet-Japanese fisheries agreement, originally scheduled to be signed on the 20th of this month, has suddenly been announced by the Soviet Union to be postponed. At the same time, negotiations on border issues have also stalled. This shows a deterioration in relations between the two countries. According to Japanese observations, the change in the Soviet Union's attitude is probably due to recent developments in international relations centered on Japan, leading to Soviet misunderstandings. It is believed that these misunderstandings will soon be resolved. However, political observers believe that if Japan does not provide a complete and thorough explanation of certain international issues, the Soviet Union will inevitably remain vigilant, and negotiations on various pending Soviet-Japanese issues will also inevitably lead to a deadlock. (Central News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government, having heard that Germany and Japan have signed an anti-communist pact, has decided not to sign the fisheries agreement that had been agreed upon with Japan. A Reuters reporter has learned that the Soviet Union may also implement other retaliatory measures, such as no longer engaging with Tokyo in negotiations to establish a "Manchukuo"-Soviet border commission or rescinding the oil concessions granted to Japan in Sakhalin. The diplomatic community is now seriously considering this matter. It is reported that the Soviet authorities are genuinely alarmed by the German-Japanese alliance, viewing this move as greatly endangering Soviet security. It is reported that a meeting of the General Staff has been convened to discuss the overall situation. It is widely believed that the Soviet Union will continue to increase the strength of its army. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet-Japanese fisheries treaty was originally scheduled to be formally signed on the 20th of this month, but the Soviet side, citing incomplete domestic procedures, notified the Japanese side of the postponement. Japanese fishermen are paying close attention to this attitude of the Soviet Union. Now, the treaty has been established as a result of Japanese concessions. Therefore, it is impossible to imagine that the reason for the postponement of the signing is beyond the scope of business issues. If there are other reasons, it is necessary to monitor the attitude of the Soviet Union and urge the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to do their best to deal with the matter.

<h3 id="e42">The German-Japanese Agreement Becomes an International Mystery; Of a Political Nature, Not a Military Alliance <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency said that amidst the rumors about the German-Japanese alliance, Mr. Fulus, the Eastern Manager of the German Ocean News Agency, reiterated yesterday, causing further confusion. The matter has almost become an international mystery. According to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter who learned from a consulate of a certain third country in Shanghai, political negotiations between Germany and Japan are indeed a fact. The purpose is to conclude an agreement of a political nature, not a military alliance of an offensive or defensive nature. The content of the agreement, on the surface, is a joint opposition to the Third International, not a straightforward confrontation with the Soviet Union. However, the previous rumors that Germany would grant Japan a long-term credit line with a term of six years, and that Japan would borrow money from Germany to purchase war materials such as aircraft and tanks, are also facts, and are included within this political agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Russian Newspaper Comments: The Soviet Union is Prepared for Foreign Invasion <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Pravda commented on the Japanese-German agreement, saying, "The top-level military negotiations between Japan and Germany have been conducted in strict secrecy for a long time, and their basic principles were finalized in 1935. During these negotiations, the Japanese representative was the military attache stationed in Berlin, and the German representative was Mr. Reisederopp. Until recently, the ambassadors of both sides were unaware of the true content of the negotiations." The Tokyo government, knowing that the Japanese-German agreement is not popular with the people, has banned the publication of news about these negotiations. The inside story of the Japanese-German military negotiations has clearly confirmed Stalin's words to American journalist Howard, "Friends of peace can act openly because they have public opinion as their backing, while enemies of peace cannot but work in secret." Foreign Minister Arita's attempt to explain this agreement by invoking the need to resist communism is ridiculous. If the purpose of this agreement is to oppose communism peacefully within the two countries, then why is it necessary to specially conclude an international agreement? The purpose of the Japanese-German agreement is very clear. The Soviet government will not be at a loss because of the Japanese-German military alliance. The Soviet Union has become a great and powerful country in the world, with an irresistible army and a rapidly growing air force. The Soviet border is equipped with vigilant defenses. The Soviet Union has consistently adopted a peaceful policy, but at the same time, it is always ready to severely strike enemies who invade its territory. The Soviet people are paying attention to the enemy's conspiracies and will be able to make a correct assessment of the fascist aggressors' alliance at any time. (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) An editorial in Izvestia entitled "The Japanese-German Conspiracy Disrupts Peace" stated, "The so-called 'anti-communism' is actually a mask for the true content of the Japanese-German secret alliance, which is clear. After the unification of the European and Asian aggressor states under the slogan of anti-Bolshevism, the whole world will know that the purpose of the conclusion of this military alliance is to realize the German-Japanese imperialist policy of aggression, to attack third parties, including the Soviet Union. Fascist Germany has put forward the slogan of 'localizing the war', as well as the collective security system and the League of Nations. This military alliance with Japan has clearly explained what the nature of the 'localized' war prepared by the German fascists is. According to the plan of the German and Japanese conspirators, this war will also spread simultaneously across two continents. The Japanese-German alliance has also revealed the hypocritical face of the Japanese government, and its explanation to the Soviet government cannot be considered satisfactory. What is most lacking in this explanation is the sincerity that Japanese diplomats always forget. The Japanese side recently officially stated that Japan has no ill will towards the Soviet Union, and that Soviet-Japanese relations only need to resolve some specific conflicts to become unusually friendly. However, at the same time, the Japanese government openly threw itself into the arms of Germany and concluded a secret military alliance, thereby seriously damaging Soviet-Japanese relations. The reliability of Japan's peace guarantees to the Soviet Union is clearly equal to that of Germany's claim to support general peace. However, what the Japanese-German military alliance endangers is not only the Soviet Union. According to their plan, the alliance will also simultaneously increase Japan's threat to Britain and the United States, as well as Germany's threat to all those in Europe who do not want to be Hitler's slaves. The Japanese-German alliance is not only a conspiracy by these aggressors against the Soviet Union, but also a conspiracy by the arsonists of world war against the whole world. This alliance is a weapon used by Hitler to coerce Britain and France. German fascists are attempting to isolate and intimidate Britain, strengthen the tendency towards isolationism in Britain regarding the European continent, and divide Britain and France. At the same time, they are also threatening France, causing it to break away from the Soviet Union and its allies in Eastern Europe. The Japanese-German alliance is undoubtedly the most serious event in the current international situation. This alliance frankly proves that the forces of war are uniting themselves, and the danger to peace is greater than before. But the danger of the aggressors does not lie in their power, because their actual strength is not equal to their shocking appearance. Their danger lies in the policy of cowardly concessions to those who oppose their oppression and in arrogance. The mobilization of the forces of war represented by the German-Japanese aggression group more urgently requires the unification of all peaceful countries to jointly resist the aggressors, and more urgently requires collective security and an organization to effectively guarantee peace. As before, Soviet diplomacy will work towards this goal, backed by its own irresistible power, and at any time under any conditions, it will be able to resist any attack and victoriously defend its territory.

<p>The French Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Camille, visited the Foreign Ministry's Horowitz yesterday and exchanged various opinions on Japan's diplomatic policy towards Europe, France's attitude towards the Spanish issue, and Japan's policy towards China. He left after one hour. During the meeting, the French ambassador mentioned the issue of Franco-Russian cooperation, saying that France had to cooperate with Soviet Russia because Poland was approaching Germany. However, as the French government has repeatedly stated, the Franco-Russian alliance is not aimed at the countries of East Asia. Furthermore, there are now various discussions in France regarding the Franco-Russian alliance, and he hoped that Japan would not misunderstand the Franco-Russian issue. (Domei News, 22nd)</p>

<p>Madrid - In the vicinity of Madrid, although the pressure from the Nationalist forces is increasing daily, the militia's strong resistance has not diminished slightly, and morale remains high. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Madrid - According to the commander-in-chief of the defending forces, the progress of the battles on the capital's front lines in recent days has been very satisfactory. The militia has recaptured the sanatorium in the university city area and the ruins of Casa de Velázquez, and has withdrawn from Casa del Campo, which is now entirely under the control of the rebels. Yesterday, the rebels spent the entire day trying to break through the resistance of the militia in the university city area, but ultimately failed. In the morning, several squadrons of Moorish cavalry charged the militia's front lines northeast of the university city area. The militia, lying in the trenches, opened fire with machine guns, causing the enemy to be defeated, many falling from their horses and dying. The surviving soldiers retreated in disarray. The soldiers on both sides in this area are very close to each other, so they dare not use artillery to avoid damaging their own side. It has been raining incessantly all day in the capital area, and there are strong winds, so the weather is cold and humid. Airplanes have not been able to wreak havoc because of this. The soldiers defending the trenches and obstacles are in urgent need of blankets to keep out the cold. Those without blankets are covering themselves in mud to keep warm. The morale of the government troops remains strong. They have been greatly encouraged in recent days as the entire front line position is more stable than before. Reinforcements are arriving daily. Before going to the front lines, they parade in formation through the city, so the people are also very excited. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Madrid - The Capital Defense Committee today ordered that all women, children, and non-combatants in the capital must be moved elsewhere, with no one allowed to remain. This is both to avoid unnecessary danger to civilians and to reduce the hardship of supplying food to the military and civilians. The committee has requisitioned a thousand vehicles to transport these people out of the capital and is planning to have these thousand vehicles return to the capital loaded with food. Government leaders have declared that after the women and children leave the capital, the soldiers on the front lines will know that their families are safe from shelling, and they will be able to fight without worries.

<p>Avila City (Currently in the hands of the Nationalist forces) - Special dispatch from our correspondent: It snowed heavily in Madrid yesterday, and the Nationalist forces' aircraft were unable to take off. However, the artillery continued to shell the vicinity of the city and the central area. The damage caused by the bombing of Madrid in recent days can be seen by reporters from a high point in Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs. For example, most of the houses near the Puerta del Sol have been destroyed, with almost none spared. The underground railway station has been shattered, with only broken walls exposed to the outside. The high-rise buildings on the "Gran Vía" have become a field of rubble. Fighting is still continuing in the nearby suburbs. Several buildings on Bermejo Street have had their lower floors occupied by the Nationalist forces. The fierce street fighting by the government forces' militia on the upper floors is evident here. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Salamanca City - The Nationalist forces' headquarters here issued a statement saying, "The government troops attacked our army on all front lines yesterday but were repulsed. Snow and rain were falling in the vicinity of Madrid, making combat extremely difficult. However, our artillery continued to bombard the government troops' positions fiercely. The government troops also attacked the area around the old Royal Palace in the Moncloa district outside the city and the northern side of Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs, but were all thwarted. Our army captured four tanks, all made in Soviet Russia. In addition, the government troops on the front lines in the province of Guadalajara east of Madrid attacked Mount Albiaire, but were also repulsed by our army, with over one hundred and fifty personnel killed." (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands - The Nationalist forces here broadcast a message stating that it has been snowing heavily in the vicinity of Madrid. As for the military situation, our army's right-wing forces have occupied a portion of the left side of Casa de Campo Park in the western suburbs (i.e., the western half). The right-wing forces have also reached the Ángel Hills pass in the southern suburbs and other areas controlling the Manzanares River (Note: This river passes southwest of Madrid). The "Puente de los Franceses" bridge on the northwest side, which connects Casa de Campo Park (on the west bank of the Manzanares River) with the Moncloa area and the university district (on the east bank of the river), has also been occupied by our army. Our army's front line has been connected in one continuous line without any obstacles. In addition, the Model Prison has been completely destroyed after days of shelling."

<p>Avila City - Special dispatch from our correspondent: Nationalist forces here are confident about the battles around Madrid, believing that capturing the capital is only a matter of time. As far as the current military situation is concerned, the foreign troops belonging to the Nationalist forces will now fight in the city, without having to fight in the countryside. This is because there are still one million residents in the city, and their militia, skilled in street fighting, is now stubbornly defending its positions. It is expected that they will put up stubborn resistance. Secondly, the government troops have now received a large number of supplies. Foreign adventurers and sympathizers of communism have formed teams and rushed to Madrid to help in the war. Their combat effectiveness is also recognized by the general public. Thirdly, in addition, the government troops in the city now have tanks and machine guns placed at strategic locations and intersections in the city, which can hinder the Nationalist forces' movements. Fourthly, General Mola, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces in the north, does not want to destroy the entire city, and only intends to send aircraft to drop bombs, and does not intend to use heavy artillery. Even if artillery fire is opened, it will be limited to light and rapid artillery, so that residents can easily take refuge. In this way, if the Nationalist forces want to capture Madrid, they must first destroy the machine guns set up by the government troops in various parts of the city. This task is very difficult and will require time. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) - Responsible figures recently declared that the British government had originally decided to recognize both sides of the Spanish civil war as belligerent groups in order to avoid dangerous incidents caused by the blockade of the port of Barcelona. However, French Ambassador Corbin visited the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon and immediately stated that the French government firmly advocated maintaining the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war and therefore did not want to recognize the Nationalist forces of that country as belligerent groups. The British government then decided to slow down and reconsider. Regarding this, official sources also stated that Britain and France would contact each other again in the hope of reaching a consensus. However, if the situation changes dramatically and immediate action is required, then that is a different matter. Although Germany and Italy have recognized the Spanish Nationalist government, they still strongly support the non-intervention policy and want to strengthen it. This has been confirmed. This is because the Soviet Union said that Germany and Italy's recognition of the Nationalist government means a violation of the principle of non-intervention. If Britain recognizes the Nationalist government as a belligerent group, it will be in collusion with Germany and Italy, so there will be more difficulties in the future. In addition, the British government recently ordered Sir Chilton, the British Ambassador to Spain, to immediately negotiate with the Spanish Nationalist government and request that a safe zone be designated in the port of Barcelona. The Nationalist government has not yet replied. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Perpignan - A large number of travelers have arrived here from Barcelona because the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, Franco, had threatened to shell the port. Some travelers believe that the shelling is likely to happen soon. At the same time, the French cruiser "Dupleix" has left Barcelona and is heading to Palma de Mallorca. The French destroyer "Albatross" has also set sail elsewhere, thus causing a rumor that the departure of the French ships stationed in Barcelona is due to the danger of the city being bombed. Paris has formally denied the above statement and said that after the "Albatross" left, another ship was sent to replace it. However, it is heard that the French consul stationed in Barcelona, in view of the potential dangers in the area, has advised all French nationals to leave. It is also heard that the French consul intends to work on French warships. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) - The United States Department of State has recently instructed its diplomats stationed in Madrid and Barcelona to prepare to cease operations and to move the local diplomatic personnel to a safe area. It is heard that a US warship is preparing to transport American nationals out of Barcelona. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) - According to reliable sources today, the United Kingdom's attitude towards the Spanish Nationalist forces' blockade of ports has become stronger. The government has decided that if British commerce is interfered with within three miles of Spanish territory, it will resist. At the same time, military experts from the Non-Intervention Committee are planning to send neutral commissioners to various parts of Europe to prevent civilian or military aircraft from flying into Spanish territory. The committee's plan has three points: (1) Monitor airfields within 1,500 miles around the Spanish border, (2) Each major European power will send five representatives, and each small country will send three representatives, (3) Establish air corridors through which aircraft entering and leaving Spain must pass. The committee estimates that the cost of setting up these commissioners is £1 million per year, which shows that the committee expects the Spanish civil war to be difficult to quell in the short term. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) - Regarding the Spanish Nationalist forces' preparation to blockade the port of Barcelona, The Times commented on Sunday that it would be wise for General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, to recognize the independent rights of the Catalan Autonomous Region. Even if General Franco captures Madrid, there will be many difficulties ahead, and he should not make more enemies. "In addition, even if General Franco wins, the price paid will be very high. In the end, the result of the civil war may only be a wasteland." Now that General Franco has threatened to shell the port of Barcelona, it shows that he does not have the power to effectively blockade the port. In this way, if his warships take any action against neutral ships, it will constitute piracy. The newspaper then commented on the actions of Italy and Germany in recognizing the Nationalist government in Burgos, saying that this was not only too hasty but also created a dangerous situation, "If each country has to change its tune in the future, it will hinder the prestige of the Nationalist forces and lose the goodwill of the Nationalist forces." It is hoped that General Franco will not go too far and must not attack Catalonia to avoid further complicating the situation. The newspaper concluded, "If General Franco has the vision of a statesman, he should announce a federal system to eliminate disputes." (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>Lille City - The state funeral for the late Minister of the Interior and Mayor of this city, Sarraut, was held here this afternoon. The crowd lined up to watch the procession from the city hall to the cemetery, stretching for two kilometers, and the number of people was unprecedented. Thousands of people came from nearby areas and from Paris and Belgium. President Lebrun sent President's Office Secretary-General Magre to represent him in offering condolences. House Speaker Herriot, Prime Minister Blum, and all cabinet members came to participate. Prime Minister Blum read a eulogy in the city hall, praising Sarraut's political career, especially after the establishment of the Popular Front government, when labor strikes broke out in the country, and the government repeatedly conducted negotiations with representatives of the General Confederation of Labor and the Employers' Federation in the hope of establishing an agreement. Sarraut played a leading role in this negotiation. At that time, labor strikes rose and fell everywhere, and the situation was unprecedentedly chaotic. Sarraut responded effectively and was able to maintain local security. This was a great achievement. Finally, the Prime Minister recounted the cause of Sarraut's death, saying that the responsibility for this should be borne by the slanderers. "We must prevent and punish slander in the future. We will definitely do this so that we will not let down our deceased friend." (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Rome) - A huge block of marble has been unearthed in the Ravaccione stone mountain, with a volume of 300 cubic meters and weighing over a thousand tons, making it the largest marble in the world. When mining, a total of 202 kilograms of explosives were used, placed in 130 locations, and ignited at the same time. The sound of the explosion was deafening and could be heard clearly even several kilometers away. Most of the cabinet members came to visit and a special viewing platform was built for visitors.

<p>Vienna - Foreign Minister Schmidt, who led the Austrian delegation to Berlin to visit, has now completed his mission and returned here. According to members of the delegation, German leaders were willing to abide by the agreement signed by Germany and Austria on July 11, i.e., the agreement that Germany would not interfere in Austria's internal affairs. This was very impressive. In addition, Austria's foreign policy should be based on the Rome Protocol of the Italo-Austrian-Hungarian three countries as a basic principle. This protocol should take precedence over other agreements. This was something that Schmidt tried to get Germany to recognize. As for the preliminary results achieved by the German-Austrian agreement, the effectiveness is most evident in the tourism business. Since the signing of the German-Austrian agreement, various restrictions on the movement of passengers between the two countries have been reduced, resulting in a large increase in tourists. Germany is also ready to purchase Austria's surplus agricultural products at any time. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Budapest - Newspapers here have not commented on Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt's trip to Berlin. According to observations by political figures, Austria seems to have been gradually attracted by the German side. This is because Hungary has been rejected by Germany, so it has a tendency to get closer to Italy. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Budapest - Regent Admiral Horthy will visit Italy. A semi-official Hungarian news agency recently released a message stating that the purpose of this trip is to reconcile the interests of the three countries of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, thereby consolidating the friendship between Italy and Hungary. Regarding this trip, all kinds of rumors from the outside world are unfounded and cannot be believed. The equal rights that all countries should enjoy, especially the equal rights of armament, are part of the entire sovereignty of the country. "Only our country can decide when to exercise this right and how to exercise it. Other countries need not be overly concerned that our government will take hasty action before the time is ripe. However, it can be asserted that Hungary will not begin negotiations with any country that cannot automatically recognize Hungary's natural rights." (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>

<p>(Moscow) - German engineer Stieklin and eight Soviet citizens, accused of sabotage in the Siberian mining area, mentioned an assassination plot during today's trial. National representative Drobnes stated that when Soviet People's Committee Chairman Molotov inspected the Volyers mining area in 1934, Stieklin conspired with others to assassinate Molotov by having Molotov's driver cause an accident on purpose. Fortunately, the car was traveling slowly, and Molotov was able to escape danger. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - German engineer Stieklin, accused of sabotage in the Siberian mining area, confessed during the court interrogation about his meeting with the German secret police. It is claimed that when he took his vacation, he visited the German secret police and reported in detail on his sabotage work in the Soviet Union. In addition, a witness testified that Stieklin did receive instructions directly from a foreign official and then carried out various acts of sabotage. According to another defendant, the gas and explosion incidents that occurred in the mining area were the conspiracy of a counter-revolutionary group to slaughter a large number of workers.

<h3 id="e62">Frustration of Bandit-Puppet Invasions of Hongge'ertu; A Certain Country's Military Officers Go to the Front to Supervise the Battle; Li Wang and Other Rebels Confer in Shangdu; Liu Guitang Colludes with Bandit-Puppets, Stirring Up Trouble <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Shangdu Dispatch: Since the bandit-puppet troops invading Hongge'ertu began their attack on the 11th of this month, up to the 19th, they have engaged in numerous battles, large and small, with the Sui troops, but have not succeeded in their aims. They have been repeatedly repelled by the Sui troops. On the 18th, the rebel leaders Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, Yin Baoshan, and others, accompanied by a certain staff officer of the Japanese Kwantung Army, personally went to the front from Shangdu to direct and supervise the battle. As a result, that evening, more than two hundred wounded soldiers, covered in blood, with broken arms and legs, and on the verge of death, were transported back from the front line. Wang, Li, and the other rebels also returned to Shangdu. At 2:00 AM on the 19th, in the dim moonlight, seven military officers from a certain country held an emergency meeting in Shangdu with Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, Wu Guting, Yin Baoshan, and other rebel leaders to discuss strategies for invading Suiyuan. Security was extremely tight. It was only heard that military pay would be distributed to the various bandit-puppet units before the 25th of this month, with the aim of encouraging their rebellious spirit and preventing defection and desertion. The Rehe bandit troops who recently arrived in Shangdu from Dolon are the units of Li Zhenming and Hu Yushan, totaling twenty heavy cannons and more than sixty machine guns. Although they are newly trained elite troops, they actually lack combat experience. All of the middle and lower-ranking officers are selected and dispatched by a certain country, and soldiers from a certain country are mixed in among them. On the morning of the 19th, they also departed for Hongge'ertu to provide reinforcements. The puppet troops of Li Shouxin and the bandit troops of Wang Ying, led by Zhang Wanqing, who have reassembled infantry in the areas of Nanhouchang and Daqinggou (the original order for Zhang to lead his troops to Bailingmiao has been cancelled), have also responded to the bandit-puppet attack on Hongge'ertu since the 18th. Under the command of the rebel Zhang Wanqing, they have begun to fiercely attack the Xinghe and Fengzhen areas of Suiyuan, and the defense lines of the Jin-Sui army. At 6:00 AM on the 19th, they launched another dawn attack, but their combat situation was not as intense as that in Taolin and Hongge'ertu. They were also repelled by the Jin-Sui defense forces. All of the military supplies, such as guns and ammunition, of the bandit-puppet troops in Chabei are stored separately in Zhangbei and Shangdu. According to reliable sources, there are more than fifty crates stored in Zhangbei and thirty tons in Shangdu. There are also forty crates of incendiary bombs. In addition, there are still twelve airplanes with the emblems of the puppet state of Manchuria parked at the Zhangbei airfield. Since the 12th, seven or eight of them have taken off every day, dropping bombs and conducting reconnaissance over Hongge'ertu, Xinghe, and Fengzhen. On the afternoon of the 18th, seven airplanes from a certain country took off from Dolon, passed through Kangbao and Shangdu, and flew towards the eastern Suiyuan area. That evening, they returned and parked at the Shangdu airfield. On the morning of the 19th, seventeen heavy trucks carrying military supplies were transported from Zhangbei to Nanhouchang and Daqinggou to supply Zhang Wanqing, Li Shouxin, and other bandit-puppet units. The coal needed by the bandit-puppets in Chabei has been transported by the Da Meng Company and the Donglu Firm, totaling more than ten million catties. Currently, the bandit-puppet troops in various counties have all been dispatched to the front lines. On the 17th of this month, dozens of bandits were suddenly discovered looting in the Tao Temple area of Chongli County. Although there are no large groups of bandits in Zhangbei County, robbery cases occur frequently. The bandit Liu Guitang (i.e., Liu Hei Qi), after his two resurrections, was defeated by Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. He then went into hiding in Tianjin, under the protection of a certain country. He was once assassinated in Tianjin this summer but did not die. Now that the situation in eastern Suiyuan is becoming increasingly tense, the bandit Liu has been restless for a long time. It is rumored that he has sent his puppet staff officer, Jin Xiyuan, to Shangdu from Tianjin on the 17th of this month. In recent days, he has visited Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, and other rebel leaders separately to discuss matters and plans to go to Jiabusi in the next few days to visit Prince De and the various Mongol bandit leaders, and then return to Tianjin. The purpose of Jin Xiyuan's visit is to represent Liu Guitang in contacting the rebel leaders to discuss methods for gathering Liu's old troops and those who have joined the rebellion in Chabei.

<p>Guilin Dispatch: Since the provincial government of Guizhou Province moved to Guilin, the environment has changed, and all administrative steps and major plans for the current situation urgently need to be properly discussed. Therefore, a joint conference of the Guizhou Provincial Party, government, and military was specially convened in Guilin on the 10th of the month. In addition to Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, and others, senior military and government officials all attended. The internal Party, government, and military issues of Guizhou Province, the future proposals of Guizhou Province for the current situation, and the contributions to the central government were all discussed. On the 12th, President Sun Ke flew to Guilin, and Li, Bai, and others were busy receiving him. The meeting was suspended for several days. Taking advantage of Sun's visit to Guizhou, the Guizhou authorities specially asked Sun to submit various proposals from Guizhou Province to the central government on behalf of the province. The joint conference on internal affairs in Guizhou Province also had many resolutions. In terms of politics, the focus was on developing agriculture, forestry, and mining, strictly enforcing the prohibition of opium and gambling, and setting nine principles for the prohibition of smoking: (1) Before the implementation of the ban, a large-scale official announcement will be held. (2) Conduct a registration of smokers. (3) People in this province are strictly prohibited from eating opium. Those who are already addicted to opium and are under 45 years old will be ordered to quit within three months. (4) Opium paste is exclusively sold. (5) Opium paste is exclusively sold. (6) Confiscate and destroy opium paraphernalia. (7) Opium cessation drugs are manufactured and sold by the Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory. (8) Criminal punishment is handled in accordance with the Central Government's Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Opium Prohibition Crimes. Regarding finance and banking, since the ratio between Guizhou currency and national currency was determined to be plus six, as of the 1st of this month, all provincial revenues and expenditures are based on national currency. Except for defense costs, all tax collection agencies still collect in haoquan converted into national currency, and expenditures are paid at 80% of the national currency amount. The silver dollar notes originally issued by the Guizhou Provincial Treasury are fully recovered by the Guangxi Bank at a price of $1.30. Before they are recovered, they are still used as $1.30. Bai Chongxi is still working hard to reorganize the troops and run military reclamation areas, etc., and has not been able to go north for a while. In addition to those who were dismissed and transferred to military reclamation areas for cultivation, a portion of the active soldiers in the Guangxi army were transferred to build roads. The Guiwu Highway is a construction project that Guangxi is eager to carry out after the relocation of the government. The route has been surveyed by personnel, and construction is currently underway, with soldiers from the 19th Division, 21st Division, and 24th Division responsible for different sections. The troops of the 19th Division had already arrived at Chencun Tang Station on the 16th, and the 24th Division also began work according to the designated section. As for Party affairs, they are still proceeding as before, and there is no clear order for reorganization. According to the Guizhou authorities, there is no need to rush to reorganize Party affairs in Guizhou Province, because Party affairs in Guizhou have always been handled in a unified and coordinated manner, without any disputes, and the organization is sound, so it is not appropriate to reorganize it rashly. Therefore, Party affairs in Guangxi are still handled as before, maintaining the status quo, and the reorganization is still under consideration. After the closing of the joint conference of the Party, government, and military, senior officials have returned separately, and in the future, they will implement the decisions of the joint conference, and the situation in Guangxi will show a new look.

<p>Li Guisheng, the former station master of the train station in this county, and others, were previously suspected of being involved in smuggling incidents at the station. The two railway bureaus suspended him from duty and immediately transferred Yu Shucheng, the deputy station master of Suzhou, and Sun Chaodong, the station master of Kunshan, to Wuxi to take over. They have been in office for nearly half a year. Last month, Yu and Sun were secretly accused to the railway bureau of privately collecting illegal fees, colluding with each other, and damaging the reputation of the railway. The bureau immediately ordered Section Chief Wang of the Transportation Section to come to Wuxi to investigate thoroughly. He investigated with a certain bank, but did not get any reliable information. After a thorough investigation, he finally found some clues and first suspended Gu Jiaxiang, a low-ranking clerk in the station master's office. Yesterday, the railway bureau also ordered Yu Shucheng and Sun Chaodong to be suspended from duty.

<p>A major theft case suddenly occurred at the Bank of Communications here the day before yesterday. The amount lost has been determined in the two iron boxes in the office, but the amount in the vault has not been checked yet because the manager went to Shanghai. All employees and service staff are under strict surveillance. The Changshu branch of the Bank of Communications was established earliest, so there are many deposits. Last year, it built a new house on Daonan Street, facing the Bank of China, and its business became more developed. Recently, Manager Zhang Guliu asked for leave to go to Shanghai for his daughter's wedding. On the morning of the 21st, all the employees were working in the office when they suddenly discovered that the two iron boxes were damaged. After opening them, the stocks, more than 10,000 yuan in cash, and the gold and jewelry sent by the manager's wife were completely lost. The business was suspended, and the case was reported to the Public Security Bureau. Chief Chen Yuchu of the bureau, considering the seriousness of the case, immediately went to investigate with the detective team leader. The iron boxes were pried open with a steel drill. The doors of the vault also had similar damage. However, the amount of the loss is difficult to know for sure before Manager Zhang returns to Changshu for inventory. In short, there were no signs of opening or closing at any of the doors, so it seems there is no doubt that it was done by an insider. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau summoned all the employees of the bank, large and small, for questioning. As a result, only a temporary cook named Li San, who had been working for only two days, was highly suspected and temporarily detained in the bureau. That night, none of the employees were allowed to return home, and the detectives were keeping a close watch on the bank. A telegram has been sent to the manager in Shanghai to report the matter, and he is expected to return to Changshu today to handle the matter.</p>

<p>On the 21st, there was a customary incense pilgrimage at the Xiaxi Lane of Meilitang Bridge. Dozens of incense boats went there to offer incense. A boat named Xiaxing, carrying more than fifty rural women, capsized near the Dahong Bridge because it was carrying too many passengers. By accident, the side of the boat hit the bridge pier, causing the boat to capsize. More than fifty rural women fell into the water. Cries and screams filled the air, and there was great chaos. The nearby farmers rushed to the rescue and saved most of them, but eight elderly women drowned. Their bodies were not recovered until late at night. Afterwards, the Public Security Bureau arrested Xia Xing, the owner of the boat and the leader of the incense pilgrimage. It is heard that most of the dead rural women were from Guli Village. After the county government reported the matter on the 22nd, it ordered the families to collect the bodies.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Grand Canal, south of the Yangtze River, is extremely important in terms of water conservancy and transportation. The provincial government previously determined the Zhensu section navigation plan in accordance with the Grand Canal reorganization discussion and survey, and prepared an engineering budget. In addition to implementing the dredging of the Zhenjiang Dantu to Wuxi Luoshe section within the scope of the drought relief project in the 23rd year, the remaining unfinished dredging project in the 24th year and the construction of the water gate engineering along the Yangtze River should be continued. The ship locks, culverts, diversion rivers, and dredging works from Wujin through Shitangwan to Wujiang were all estimated to cost 2 million yuan. Because the provincial government asked the National Economic Committee to allocate funds to assist in handling, but because of the large amount of funds required, it was feared that it would be difficult to prepare, and it was determined to set another 25-year project plan, and first implement the dredging of the Dantu to Zhenjiang section, and build a control water gate, estimating that the project cost will need more than 260,000 yuan, and also requested the Economic Committee to check and allocate 180,000 yuan to facilitate the process. Soon the reply was approved, and it was agreed to assist with 100,000 yuan. Recently, the provincial government has compiled a project budget, and ordered the Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office to rush to start construction.</p>

<p>In the Du Guo area of Ci Dong Wenxi, a resident named Shen Wenjian, who runs a money shop in Shanghai and is quite wealthy, attracted the attention of bandits. On the morning of the 20th of this month, at 2 a.m., ten bandits, each wielding a weapon, planned to kidnap his daughter and demand a large ransom. Unexpectedly, they mistakenly entered the home of Shen's neighbor, Zhou Deliu, and kidnapped Zhou's daughter, Fangqin (18 years old). Near the Xijing Hall, the bandits realized their mistake through the eyes of someone, so they decided to continue with the plan and took Zhou's daughter on a small boat pre-docked in the river, sailing towards Ningbo. When they arrived at the Sanbao Bridge on the Jiangbei shore of this port, they were intercepted by Zhou Caiyou, the seventh Baochang of Du Guo, who had been tracking them, and detectives who had come to Ningbo. Because it was still dark at the time, only two bandits were captured besides the hostage, while the others escaped.

<h3 id="e89">Donghua in a Difficult Battle: 3-3 Draw with La克斯 (Lakes) / Li Ning Absent Due to Illness, Guarding Strength Reduced / La克斯 (Lakes) Fights with Ten Men, Maintaining Advantage Throughout / Tense Performance by Both Sides, a Grand Spectacle <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>In this season's league, Donghua encountered a formidable opponent for the first time yesterday, La克斯 (Lakes), which is generally recognized as the bravest and most skilled team of this year. Previously, the French Business team narrowly escaped with a 7-5 victory, almost being defeated. Yesterday's meeting with Donghua at Yiyuan was an anticipated intense battle. Therefore, four or five thousand spectators attended, making it one of the most attended matches of this league. The tension and excitement of the situation were also rare. As the final minutes approached, the battle became more intense, captivating the audience, who enthusiastically cheered, almost forgetting that the game was about to end.</p>
<p>A Tense and Delightful Situation</p>
<p>The result of the fierce battle was a 3-3 draw. This was Donghua's first loss of points. The closeness of the score and the eventual draw proved the balance of power between the two teams. However, it cannot be said that Donghua's luck was not good. The fact that Donghua was able to retaliate after each goal scored by La克斯 (Lakes) showed their dedication to fighting the enemy, which is commendable. If La克斯 (Lakes) had not missed the second penalty kick, the outcome might not have been so optimistic. Throughout the game, La克斯 (Lakes)'s quick runs, solid lines, and intense competition, as well as Donghua's determination to resist the enemy and regain lost ground, made for a tense performance that was both delightful and spectacular, even though they could not defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Agile Actions Make It Difficult for the Referee</p>
<p>However, the only drawback was that the referee, Zhang Le, was dissatisfied by both teams and the audience, making the atmosphere at the stadium less pure. Because the game progressed quickly and the actions were sharp, the referee was unable to keep up, and it was inevitable that mistakes would occur, leading to criticism from all sides. From the perspective of an "outsider looking in," Mr. Zhang did make some wrong decisions. Donghua's last goal was clearly offside, but there was no time to correct it. The expulsion of La克斯 (Lakes)'s right forward, Bo Lifu, could have been replaced with a "warning" because, although his actions were inappropriate, they were not a direct confrontation. There was a decision by the Donghua guard to trip an enemy from behind in front of the goal to save the ball, which was not penalized with a penalty kick. Donghua's second penalty kick seemed excessive. However, if one were in his position, such mistakes would be inevitable and should not be overly criticized.</p>
<p>Li Ning's Absence Leads to Relaxed Guarding</p>
<p>Donghua's biggest loss yesterday was Li Ning's absence due to illness, which greatly affected the inner guard. Furthermore, Gu Shangxiang's retirement from Li Lian also impacted the forward strength. Ding Zhaocheng is indeed a young talent who can handle the position, but he lacks experience, and his tackling and interception are not yet reliable. Moreover, Gu's performance as an inner guard is far inferior to his performance as a forward. Feng Yunyou had to take care of both inside and outside, but he was stretched too thin. Chen Zhenhe assisted in both guarding and attacking, making him the most hardworking. The two wings of the forward line showed no improvement and remained mediocre. Sun Jinshun was able to act as the second line of defense for the forwards, but he could not break through the enemy head-on. Wen Kuilin and Jing Erren had few opportunities to shoot. The opponent's center-back, Qian Zhiwen, was solid and dealt a major blow to Donghua. Simmons single-handedly blocked the center, working hard and making great contributions. He is currently the most outstanding center-back in Shanghai. The forwards' rapid attacks often caught Donghua off guard. Although Adi Jie is old, he is still a hero. His sprints and passes were beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Meda replaced Ge Bomen, making the front line more lively. If it were not for the fact that they were playing with ten men, it would have been even more difficult for Donghua to cope.</p>
<p>Efforts Lead to a Draw</p>
<p>At the beginning, after only five minutes, Feng Yunyou was penalized with a penalty kick for touching the ball with his hand while saving it, resulting in a one-goal deficit. Fortunately, La克斯 (Lakes) was also penalized with a penalty kick shortly after, which Dai Linjing scored, making it 1-1. Twenty-five minutes later, La克斯 (Lakes)'s right forward, Griff, was unintentionally kicked and injured by Sun Jinshun and left the field. He re-entered five minutes later, intending to retaliate against Lao Sun. Because of his poor attitude, he was expelled from the field. From then on, La克斯 (Lakes) played with only ten men. Unexpectedly, Donghua was instead attacked and conceded a goal. Later, thanks to a free kick, Sun Jinshun and Jia Youliang worked together to make it a 2-2 draw in the first half. In the second half, after fifteen minutes, Donghua was again penalized with a penalty kick. Fortunately, Rong Cai blocked it, but they still conceded a goal not long after. In the final struggle, Wen 孤军奋战 (fought alone), creating a draw. After that, Donghua's offense was very strong, determined to win. They besieged the enemy for a long time. La克斯 (Lakes) also occasionally attempted major attacks, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Each Team Penalized with One Penalty Kick</p>
<p>La克斯 (Lakes) started the attack first, and both sides immediately engaged in a fierce battle. Dai Linjing was the first to attack, but his shot brushed against the goalpost. After five minutes, Feng Yunyou inadvertently touched the ball with his hand while saving it in front of the goal, and was penalized with a penalty kick. Kou Meini scored, giving Donghua a one-goal deficit. The audience was shocked. La克斯 (Lakes) continued to press forward, and Gu Shangxiang panicked when saving the ball, kicking the ball back towards the front of the goal. If Chen Zhenhe had not rushed back like a whirlwind, the consequences would have been dire. After ten minutes, Donghua counterattacked, and Dai Linjing dribbled the ball into the penalty area, passing it to the right. Jia Youliang caught up and shot, falling into a pile with the goalkeeper and the La克斯 (Lakes) inner guard. The referee blew the whistle and awarded La克斯 (Lakes) a penalty kick. The center forward, Dai, returned the favor in the same way, a fair trade.</p>
<p>Foreign General Is Rude, Ordered Off the Field</p>
<p>After Donghua scored, they were filled with joy. Dai Linjing looked for an opportunity to shoot again, but it was saved by Qin Sheng. Griff dribbled the ball forward, and Sun Jinshun stepped forward to snatch it, accidentally injuring Griff. Griff left the field to have his wound dressed and re-entered the field five minutes later, intending to retaliate. In front of the La克斯 (Lakes) goal, he tried to be rude to Sun Jinshun. The referee immediately ordered him off the field. From then on, the La克斯 (Lakes) team played with only ten men, but their morale did not decrease. Kou Meini launched an attack in the central plains, advancing straight ahead. The Donghua guards were all left behind. The situation was precarious. Xiao Heitan saw that the situation was not good and rushed up like a whirlwind, tripping him from behind. Although Ge Meini did not fall, the ball was already behind him. Heitan calmly saved the ball, and it was fortunate that no penalty was awarded.</p>
<p>Scoring Again One After Another, Tit for Tat</p>
<p>La克斯 (Lakes) continued their siege, and the Donghua guards did not seem to be able to cooperate, allowing the enemy to wreak havoc. Simmons held the center, connecting with the front and back. In the melee, Kou Meini shot fiercely, penetrating the corner of the goal. Rong Cai was extremely frustrated. Donghua kicked off and attacked with force. Sun Jinshun missed a good opportunity. Wan Xianghua kicked a good free kick from the right side. It was intercepted by Shu Wenkui, and Dai Linjing returned to the fray, advancing in conjunction with Wen Kui, earning a free kick opportunity. Lao Sun took the kick, and Jia Youliang intercepted it in the center, adding a kick, successfully making it a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>Gu and Zhuang Yield to Each Other, The Fisherman Profits</p>
<p>After the first half, La克斯 (Lakes) seemed quite angry. After being lectured by the manager, everyone cheered up. After the start of the game, they took the initiative, harassing everywhere. Donghua worked together to defend, and dangerous situations arose frequently. Suddenly, they were penalized with a penalty kick. The crowd stomped their feet and sighed, while La克斯 (Lakes) showed a look of satisfaction. Kou Meini took the penalty kick for the second time, kicking the ball and hitting the goalpost, bouncing out. Lei Hen caught up and attacked again, but was eventually saved by Rong Cai, to their great delight. However, La克斯 (Lakes) attacked again. Gu Shangxiang and Zhuang Youren yielded to each other, giving the ball to Rong Cai, disregarding the enemy's covetous gaze from behind. Adi Jie caught up and shot into the goal. How unjust and wrong!</p>
<p>Little Xu Struggles Valiantly, Creating a Draw</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was not good, Donghua tried to regain lost ground. The morale of the entire team was renewed, and everyone cheered valiantly. Wen Kui dribbled the ball towards the center, and the goalkeeper, Aiqu Gu Fu, took the lead, kicking the ball out. Dai Linjing arrived soon after and kicked the ball into the goal, but it was disallowed because Wen Kui was offside. Soon after, Xu suffered a slight injury and left the field. He immediately re-entered after a moment and continued to press, eventually allowing Xu Wen Kui to shoot into the enemy's goal, creating a 3-3 draw. Donghua narrowly escaped defeat. They then tried to win, desperately struggling, and the entire army surrounded the enemy's goal. The inner guards also came out to assist, with a fierce aura. The enemy was besieged on all sides, and the atmosphere became more tense. La克斯 (Lakes) was flustered and unable to parry, showing signs of panic, and finally managed to hold on to their territory. They then quickly rushed into Donghua's territory. Bo Lin Gai was in a threatening posture, but ultimately failed. The game ended in a draw.</p>

<p>In yesterday's match between the Donghua Football Club and La克斯 (Lakes) at Yiyuan, the referee, Zhang Le, seemed to have made some inappropriate penalties. Fortunately, the game ended in a draw; otherwise, disputes would have been inevitable. Donghua lost a major general due to Li Ning's illness, like losing a barrier, almost leading to disaster. The La克斯 (Lakes) team played bravely with ten men in the second half. Donghua was fortunate to avoid defeat. The overall battle situation was tight, with each side experiencing moments of shock and awe. However, Donghua's loss of the third goal was due to the lack of cooperation between the two inner guards, allowing the enemy to profit. Looking at the overall situation, there were as many as three penalty kicks, and there may have been some discrepancies in between. Also, a decision was made that Black Carbon hooked in the restricted area, but no penalty was awarded. As for Donghua's third goal, Xu Wen Kui was judged to be offside, and the fourth goal was also offside but not canceled. This may have been due to the tense situation and emotional panic.

<h3 id="e98">Southern Football Scene / Xu Heng and Xu Yahui / Performing in Hong Kong / Five China Team Participating in the First Division / South China's Aura Overwhelms the Masses <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Hong Kong) Old friends from the Shanghai football scene, Xu Yahui and Xu Heng, are currently performing in Hong Kong. Xu Heng belongs to the Eastern Association and serves as a goalkeeper. Xu Yahui was one of the last members of our country's World Games delegation to return home. He recently arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore and played for the Jiu Hua Association on Sunday, serving as a center back. He may reside in Hong Kong for a long time and belong to the association. The situation in the Hong Kong football scene this year is slightly different from previous years. Chinese football teams account for five teams in the First Division. A brief introduction is as follows:</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Hong Kong Common Cup First Division</p>
<p>Eastern Association</p>
<p>The Eastern Association, to which Xu Heng belongs, is a newly emerging team that originally belonged to the Second Division. This is the first time they have been promoted to the First Division. Their results have been quite impressive. They recently defeated the Western Police by four goals. Last Saturday (the 14th) they played against the current leading team, Austria. In terms of personal skills and overall strength, the East felt inferior. However, knowing that they could not be defeated, the whole team worked together and fought to the death, with extraordinary spirit. Unfortunately, they unexpectedly lost a goal within the first eight minutes. In the second half, they launched relentless counterattacks, but they constantly missed opportunities. In the last few seconds of the game, they got a penalty kick opportunity. Chen Yutian shot fiercely, but it was blocked by the opponent. Everyone hoped for a draw, but it turned out to be a pipe dream. How unfortunate. Xu Heng's excellent performance saved countless dangerous situations, earning unanimous praise. Their lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Heng</p>
<p>Lai Tingcai Wu Yingji</p>
<p>Zhang Guocai Yang Guohua Zeng Zhongyun</p>
<p>Jin Baizhao Chen Yutian Song Sheng Zheng Shaokang Chen Bingtu</p>
<p>Jiu Hua Association</p>
<p>In addition to the Eastern Association, another new team is the Jiu Hua Association. Although the name of the association is new, the talents are all veterans of the battlefield. Most of them are former members of the Chinese Association and almost all of them. In addition to Chen Hongguang and Xu Yahui, there are also Xiao Dianlian, Mai Shaohan, Li Guojian Huang Yongkang, Deng Guangsen, He Zuoxian, etc., all famous generals of the Chinese team in the past. Therefore, the strength of the Chinese Association has been greatly affected this year. The association lost to the Summer game on Sunday (the 15th) by a score of 0-2. Xu Yahui's performance was diminished due to lack of practice. Deng Guangsen also treated a penalty kick in the second half, resulting in a duck egg. Its line is as follows:</p>
<p>Xiao Dianlian</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang Mai Shaohan</p>
<p>He Zuoxian Xu Yahui Li Guozhao</p>
<p>Feng Qingyu Zou Wenzhi Huang Yongkang Liu Songsheng Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>South China China</p>
<p>The younger brother soldiers of the South China Association, South China China, are better than the older brother South China South this year. The players are mostly new, young and strong. Like newborn calves, they are eager to fight. Therefore, since the dispatch of troops, they have not been defeated except for one draw. In fact, they are currently ranked first. Hong Kong people call it "full of youthful spirit", which is true. Last Saturday, they defeated the Western Association by a score of 4-2. Some said that they only won by four goals, which is too little, but it is enough to show the strength of South China China. The center forward of the team, Chen Dehui, once came to Shanghai and joined the Donghua team. During his time in Donghua, he only played for the B team. The A team did not use his talents, so he never had a successful performance. Therefore, the impression of Chen among Shanghai fans is also very weak. Chen has become a famous general in Hong Kong. Because those around him can cooperate, he can give full play to his strengths and show his inherent skills. From this, we can see the level of football in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and the so-called "Shanghai School" is a very appropriate term.</p>
<p>Huang Hua Ji</p>
<p>Zhong Huilin Xian Zan</p>
<p>Yang Benhan Lin Depu</p>
<p>Li Yan You Zhuo Shijin Chen Dehui Wu Qu Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>South China South</p>
<p>South China South has reached the old and mature stage. Li Huitang's non-participation is the biggest loss. Mr. Li has already stated that he will retire to the forest and spring from now on, enjoying the pleasure of leisure. His fame has spread far and wide, and he has nothing else to ask for. Even if he is not told to do so quickly, he will not easily go to sea, let alone bother to participate in the league. The goalkeeper of the team, Huang Jiliang, Bao Jia Pingping does not often attend, and is replaced by the newcomer Zhu Zhaoheng, whose performance is not as good as Huang Huaji of South China South. Last Sunday, they defeated the Chinese Association 3-0. Their recent lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaoheng</p>
<p>Liu Mao Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Li Guowei Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao</p>
<p>Zheng Jiliang Huang Meishun Tan Jiangbai Li Zhaorong Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Chinese Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Association is currently in a state of material difficulty. The whole team is made up of new people. It is expected that its strength will be reduced. The whole team lacks contact and each fights for their own cause. Since the war, there have been nine games, only winning one game. The current situation is only slightly better than the Western catch. Judging from the following lineup, you can know the strength of the game</p>
<p>Tan Jun Gan</p>
<p>Huang Xibing Luo Weimin</p>
<p>Luo Wei Wu Dele Lu Guanyi</p>
<p>Zhang Manrong Li Deqi Li Hongqing Qian Chifen Guo Linxiang</p>

<h3 id="e99">Lecture by Visiting Professors Between China and England: Lecturer Zhang Pengchun Returns to China, Gives a Speech at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge Yesterday, Entitled "Comparison of Chinese and English University Education" <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>For the purpose of promoting cultural exchange between China and England, a program for exchanging university lecturers was established. Last year, the Chinese professors who went to England included Li Shiyun, and the British professor who came to China was Evans. This year, the Chinese professor who went to England was Zhang Pengchun. Zhang is the younger brother of Zhang Boling, currently a professor at Nankai University and a lecturer at the University of Chicago in the United States. This time, he returned to China and came to Shanghai. At 3:00 PM yesterday, he gave a speech at the auditorium of the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge titled "A Comparison of British University Education and Chinese University Education." Since England has sixteen universities, and Mr. Zhang has already visited twelve, he has a deep understanding of British university education. The following is an excerpt of his speech, provided as a reference for those in China who are managing university education.</p>
<p>Historical Background of British Universities</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang first discussed the historical background of British universities, which can be divided into three periods. The first period universities, namely Oxford and Cambridge, have a history of six or seven hundred years and are the oldest universities in England, with a landowning background. The second period university is the University of London, established a hundred years ago, representing emerging industrial and commercial capitalists. The third period universities are the higher vocational schools in major cities forty years ago, focusing on new sciences, such as Manchester, Liverpool, and Leeds. However, even the old universities have now shifted to new trends.</p>
<p>Status of Universities in Society</p>
<p>British society is relatively stable and the pace of change is slower. Therefore, people in universities do not feel an immediate political responsibility, but their interest in studying politics is very strong, much stronger than in China. This strong interest is sufficient to encourage various political studies and discussions. Each faction has small groups, and even those with differing political views discuss openly, unlike Chinese university students whose interest in politics is too weak and too simplistic.</p>
<p>University Lifestyle</p>
<p>Generally, British university students' lifestyle is divided into small groups. Within each small group, teachers and students live together. This is because British universities are organized like religious monasteries. However, this atmosphere is now less prevalent, but communal living still exists. Their colleges are not based on academic departments but on residence. Those who live together form a college, providing multifaceted training, including character development, organizational skills, and the ability to handle social situations, teaching them how to be a person. They especially emphasize physical exercise, which is not just for a few but is required for everyone. Therefore, their collective living is particularly good.</p>
<p>Teaching Methods - The Tutorial System</p>
<p>Chinese universities mostly imitate the United States in their teaching methods, using lectures and a credit system, which has now aroused general dissatisfaction. England uses the tutorial system. When a student enters, they do not enter the entire university but first enter a college. They meet with a tutor at least once or twice a week, submit an essay for each meeting, and can freely talk with the tutor, allowing the tutor to understand the student's personality. However, sufficient funding is necessary because a tutor teaches a maximum of ten to twenty students per week. Moreover, the academic terms in England are different from those in China, with three terms per year, each lasting eight weeks. At the beginning of the term, they focus on stimulating the students' spirit and thinking, and they read and accumulate knowledge during the holidays, making it difficult to implement in China.</p>
<p>Requirements for Reforming University Education</p>
<p>How should Chinese university education be reformed? There are three fundamental conditions: (1) It is hoped that social order will become more organized day by day so that university education can be improved; (2) the cultivation of teachers; (3) creating a new educational atmosphere of human relationships, etc.</p>

<p>The Joint Association of Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Soviet China, Jiangsu Province, sent a telegram yesterday to Chairman Fu of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, stating: "Recently, bandits and puppets have invaded our territory, causing national turmoil. Fortunately, you, sir, have supervised the soldiers at the front, fighting hard and defending the country with loyalty, courage, and diligence, which is admired by all. Suiyuan Province is the gateway to our country, and the fate of national sovereignty and the people rests upon it. It is hoped that you will bravely advance and annihilate the bandits and save the country. Our association has already sent a circular to all colleagues in the province to raise donations for consolation and will send this telegram first to express our respect. The Joint Association of Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Jiangsu Province respectfully bows."</p>
<p>Soochow University and Suzhou High School</p>
<p>"To Chairman Fu of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, Recently, bandits and puppets have disturbed our borders.

<p>Aurora University had already remitted 1,000 yuan from the donations of faculty, staff, and students on the 21st to Chairman Fu. Yesterday, the school held its second meeting of representatives for supporting Suiyuan, attended by over twenty people. The meeting resolved: (1) to elect Wang Chen, Li Zhizhong, and seven others as standing committee members of the support association; (2) to join the Shanghai Cultural Support Association's united movement; (3) to organize a rescue training class, to be managed by the medical school, to work in Suiyuan if necessary; (4) faculty and staff to donate one day's salary per month; (5) to set up donation boxes throughout the school to be opened weekly; (6) to hold performances within the day to raise funds, etc.</p>
<p>Minsheng Junior High School and Junior High School</p>
<p>"Junior High School Students Sending Aid to Suiyuan" states in a letter: "Here, we have 7 yuan as a token of appreciation for the soldiers in Suiyuan. We believe you won't say we're giving too little, because this is all the pocket money we've saved. In the future, we want to collect money every Saturday and send it to your newspaper office until the war stops. We believe we'll continue doing this unless there's some special circumstance. We also hope that all junior high schools in the city will unite to form the Shanghai Junior High School Students' Support Association for Suppressing Bandits in Suiyuan, seeking a response from the students in North China."</p>

Although our member manufacturers are in a time of declining business and financial turnover, and are struggling to cope, the national crisis is unprecedented and the future is dire. Even if we cannot achieve the grand wish of donating generously, we should still donate goods within our ability to provide to the front. According to the investigation, the current urgent needs at the front are winter clothing and goggles, anti-poison masks, treatment drugs, and food, etc. I implore you to consider the scope of production and the needs of the situation, and donate as much as you can. If you are sympathetic, please send the donation to the Suiyuan Anti-Bandit Military Relief and Rescue Association in this city, or send it directly to our association for transfer. We sincerely pray.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Uniform Donation Method: Party and Government Agencies to Confer Today, Suppressing Unauthorized Street Fundraising, and Convening Public Groups to Discuss Unified Organization <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Since the bandits and puppets willingly flattered foreign powers and, driven by the enemy, invaded the border of Suiyuan with all their might, our nation's citizens have been stirred by righteous indignation, rising up to donate funds to aid and comfort the soldiers suppressing the bandits. Various sectors of our city's populace have successively responded, fervently organizing Suiyuan Support Movements. However, in recent days, many different organizations have been established, and the authority over relief efforts has not been unified, inevitably leading to potential abuses. The party and government agencies of our city, along with various important public groups, recently held a meeting and resolved to suggest that the authorities organize a unified committee to demonstrate solidarity. They also resolved to strictly suppress any street fundraising not authorized by the authorities. A reporter from the Da Gong News Agency learned yesterday from the city's party headquarters that the organization of a unified patriotic donation committee was indeed deemed important in practice. However, to carefully plan detailed procedures, it was decided that an initial exchange of views would take place with the municipal government tomorrow (today). Subsequently, a joint meeting of various important groups would be scheduled to discuss the procedures to demonstrate unity and avoid abuses.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: The public boatmen's union in the fourth district of this city submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Submitting this document for the complete loss of livelihood of the workers, requesting immediate relief, and quickly sending personnel to stop the illegal use of armed force to oppress, ordering the restoration of work for all members, in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers and benefit the labor movement. Our union members have been excessively exploited by the foreman, Li Shibao, and their income is insufficient for survival. We have previously petitioned your bureau to abolish the foreman system, so that wages can be verified and distributed by each business, in order to avoid exploitation. Fortunately, your bureau approved our request and ordered Guangbang Fruit Business United Benefit Hall to comply. However, the foreman refused to accept this and disregarded everything, using armed force to oppress on October 26. On the one hand, he hired new workers from Jiangbei and took the opportunity to seize work, resulting in a bloody tragedy. All the details of what happened have been repeatedly submitted to your bureau for review. The foreman not only disobeyed the orders of your bureau, but also did not resign. Instead, he used armed force to oppress, preventing all members of our union from working, resulting in the complete loss of livelihood for hundreds of workers. If relief is not provided quickly, hundreds of lives will starve to death, or other unfortunate events may occur. Therefore, we are compelled to submit another document to your bureau for review, requesting that you, Director, consider the livelihood of the workers, quickly find a way to provide relief, and quickly send personnel to stop Li Shibao from illegally using armed force to oppress, and ordering Lianyi Hall to comply with the previous order, immediately restore work for all members, in order to maintain the livelihood of the workers and benefit the labor movement. We submit this document with the utmost urgency, awaiting your orders."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Strict Prevention of Government Employees Privately Smoking Opium: Central Government Notifies This City's Party Headquarters to Comply: Same Procedures for Party Members and Party Workers <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Since General Supervisor Chiang actively promoted the ban on smoking and drugs, remarkable results have been achieved. The procedures for government employees who smoke opium are even stricter. Recently, the Opium Suppression General Supervision Department, in order to prevent evasive behavior when conducting investigations of government employees who privately smoke opium, specially formulated three measures, which were submitted to the National Government for promulgation and compliance, and sent to the Central Government for compliance. This city's party headquarters immediately distributed orders to its subordinates to comply. The measures are recorded below: (1) When the head of the government employee's service agency receives the order for investigation, he must immediately order the government employee under investigation to depart from the following day and go to the designated investigation location for investigation. The head of the agency must report the date of departure, but the designated investigation location should be limited to the nearest court from the investigation institution to the service agency. (2) If the government employee under investigation has not reported for investigation one week after the date of departure, it will be deemed as evasion, and the agency that ordered the investigation should investigate at any time and order the head of the agency to dismiss the government employee under investigation and order him to report for investigation, and pay attention to clinical diagnosis for identification. If it is verified that he is addicted, he should be sent to the military law agency for legal punishment. (3) If the government employee under investigation is unable to depart for investigation immediately due to important duties or illness, or if the distance between the service agency and the designated investigation location is more than four days, the head of the agency may, when receiving the order, invite three or more local military and political agencies to extract the urine of the government employee under investigation, put it into a glass bottle, seal it with a wooden stopper and sealing wax, and prepare two copies of the certificate, each indicating the urine of so-and-so. The urine extraction witnesses shall affix their seals on both copies, with one copy attached to the bottle mouth and the other copy submitted with the document for mailing and testing.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Capital Express on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Readily Prepared; Measures to Maintain Punctuality Notified to All Stations, Ordering Preparations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, having received orders to prepare the "Capital Express" on the Beijing-Shanghai line, have successfully completed the joint planning by the Traffic, Mechanical, and other departments. Passenger cars and locomotives have all been assembled at the Wusong Locomotive Factory. Passenger ticket prices and train schedules have been determined by the Traffic Department and will soon be implemented. The Traffic Department of the two railway administrations hereby notifies all stations: It is learned that the Capital Express, which is planned to run on the Beijing-Shanghai line, will soon be implemented. As the speed of this express train is high, attention should be paid to the two key factors of traffic safety and punctuality. All relevant section chiefs of the Traffic Department should meticulously train all train staff and drivers to strictly adhere to regulations and serve diligently. Furthermore, they must be closely supervised at all times to ensure safety. In addition to the detailed measures for the operation of the express train, which will be notified separately in the future, the following are the measures for maintaining punctuality: (1) Before the train arrives at the station, the stationmaster on duty should instruct the relevant staff to be stationed at their service posts and plan and arrange all necessary matters in advance. Luggage and packages for departure should be stacked in suitable locations. The stacking of luggage and packages must have a fixed order and position to avoid difficulties in loading and unloading at the station. Other procedures such as handling, acceptance, and signing should also be expedited. (2) If a large quantity or heavy luggage or packages are being shipped out, sufficient porters should be prepared in advance to quickly move and load them, ensuring that it is completed within the specified time. At the same time, the destination station should be notified to allow for preparation. Once the departure time arrives, loading should be stopped, and the remaining luggage and packages should be left for the next available train. (3) Passengers departing from the station should be informed by the stationmaster on duty, with the assistance of station police and staff, of the appropriate locations to stand, so that they can board the train calmly and avoid rushing around. If they are carrying heavy or a large number of hand luggage and packages, they should be advised to put them in the luggage compartment. Elderly, weak, and slow-moving passengers should be assisted by station staff in boarding the train. If the departure time has arrived, the order to depart should be given immediately. Those who fail to board the train should be advised to take the next available train, and the train should not be stopped again. (4) Before the train arrives at a stopping station, the on-board staff should notify passengers disembarking to prepare in advance to avoid confusion and delay the train schedule. (5) Other trains related to the Capital Express should also strictly maintain their punctuality to avoid hindering the meeting and causing delays. (6) If special circumstances are discovered, other relevant stations should be notified immediately to prepare in advance to avoid delaying the train schedule. All of the above points should be strictly observed. This is to inform the Transportation Section, Business Section, Traffic Section Chiefs of each section of the Beijing-Shanghai line, Stationmasters of each station on the Beijing-Shanghai line, Train conductors on the Beijing-Shanghai line, and (copies sent to) the Mechanical Department and the police station stationed on both railways.</p>

<h3 id="e123">New Long-Distance Telephone Regulations Set to Take Effect Next Month; Cancellation Procedures Specified; Scheduled Calls Temporarily Postponed <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' newly revised "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Business Regulations" will officially take effect on the first day of next month. This new regulation has many improvements. The differences between the new regulations and the old regulations are recorded as follows: (1) When a long-distance call is connected to the called party, and they are already engaged in a local call, the receiving exchange may, with the consent of the called party, interrupt the local call and connect the long-distance call. (2) In the past, a long-distance call to a specific telephone number in a certain location without specifying a particular person to answer the call was referred to as a "number call." Now it is called a "calling number call." Also, in the past, a long-distance call to a specific telephone number in a certain location and specifying a particular person to answer the call was called an "advance notice call." Now it is called a "calling person call." After the calling party has confirmed the "calling number" or "calling person," the type of call will be clearly identifiable at a glance. As for the scheduled call in the old regulations, although it has been renamed a scheduled call, its implementation will be temporarily postponed next month. (3) In the past, those who made an advance notice call had to pay an additional one-third of the ordinary call fee, and those who made a paging call had to pay an additional special fee of one jiao. The new regulations stipulate that the price of a paging call is the same as the price of a calling person call, and no additional special fee will be charged. (4) The cancellation fee in the new regulations is generally lower than that in the old regulations, less than one-third of the cost of a regular number call. (5) The prices specified in the current ordinary telephone price list are for ordinary number calls. The prices for paging calls, calling person calls, and cancellation fees must be consulted in the "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Classification Price Comparison Table." (6) Cancellation fees for ordinary number calls during daytime will be charged. (7) The scope of paging is limited to three kilometers, a reduction of two kilometers compared to the past. (8) After placing a call, the calling party may change the type of call before receiving a connection notification, but only from ordinary to urgent and from number call to calling person. (9) The calling party of a calling person call may, in addition to specifying one called party, also specify one representative of the called party. (10) After the calling party has registered the call, if the line is congested and the ordinary call has been waiting for two hours (previously four hours) or the urgent call has been waiting for one hour (previously two hours) without being connected, the cancellation fee may be waived. (11) During busy hours, the number of consecutive calls will be limited to three.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Report from Consulate in Honolulu: World Tea Market Conditions; October Sees Sharp Increase in Chinese Tea Exports <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Chinese tea has historically held an important position in the international market. However, in the past half-century, it has gradually declined. Recently, the Chinese people have gradually become aware of the need for improvement. With the unified control of Anhui black tea exports and the Commercial Inspection Bureau handling on-site inspections to ensure quality, exports this month have improved compared to previous months. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fierce Competition in the World Market</p>
<p>According to a report from our consulate in Honolulu to the International Trade Bureau, Chinese tea is gradually losing its advantage in the US tea market and will be eliminated by Japanese, Indian, Ceylon, and Javanese teas. There is an urgent need to catch up. The US is the second-largest tea market in the world. However, Chinese tea exports to the US currently account for only about 9% of the total. Americans who drink tea value quality and do not pay attention to economy. Therefore, our country must urgently improve quality to have any hope. Promotion is also important. The four tea-producing countries of India, Ceylon, Java, and Sumatra are planning to jointly raise 100,000 English pounds to conduct large-scale promotions in the four regions of East, Southeast, West, and Central China, holding lectures in schools and hotels for competitive sales, seeking to expand their scope and eliminate tea sales from other countries. This is worth noting. Furthermore, Americans have different preferences for tea: (1) Philadelphia prefers Fuzhou tea. (2) New York and Boston prefer Taiwanese Oolong. (3) Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as various states in the eastern US, prefer Oolong, whether Chinese or Taiwanese. (4) The western US and northern border provinces prefer Japanese tea. (5) The central states prefer Chinese tea. It is hoped that domestic tea merchants will pay attention.</p>
<p>Chinese Tea Exports Improve in October</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau has released statistics. Tea exports in October of this year totaled 3,636.86 kilograms to the United States, 330.79 kilograms to Canada, 165.04 kilograms to France, 528.01 kilograms to Germany, 1,947.27 kilograms to the United Kingdom, 532.91 kilograms to the Netherlands, 582.89 kilograms to the Soviet Union, 6,509.91 kilograms to Morocco, 1,550.99 kilograms to Algeria, 413.95 kilograms to Tunisia, 858.10 kilograms to Africa and other regions, 22.25 kilograms to India, 1,585.31 kilograms to Hong Kong, and 954.94 kilograms to other countries, totaling 19,826.23 kilograms. This includes 12,320.67 kilograms of green tea, 6,276.42 kilograms of black tea, and 1,229.14 kilograms of other teas. This is a slight increase compared to the total exports of 19,751.65 kilograms in the same month last year. The cumulative total for the first ten months of this year is 227,314.21 kilograms, an increase of 81,238.42 kilograms compared to 145,085.79 kilograms in the same period last year.</p>

Furthermore, if such ships do not have mooring places at the existing buoys and wharves between the Wusong Lighthouse and the Wusong River, they should moor outside the mouth of the Wusong River. All ship owners are hereby ordered to comply. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<p>The Yarn and Tape Industry Association of this city has scheduled a special meeting of members for the 25th. Yesterday, it notified all members, stating: "Respectfully, we have received approval from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau under file number Hai Zi 3894 regarding the submission of a request to move the association's premises for record. We have noted that the relocation of the association's premises has been approved for record. However, it has been found that since the association received the instruction from the Municipal Party Headquarters certifying its sound organization in March of the 24th year, it has not yet completed the procedures for registration with the bureau as required by law. This is improper. Therefore, a copy of the Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Registration of Industrial and Commercial Organizations is hereby issued, and you are required to comply accordingly. It is understood that after receiving the instruction certifying its sound organization, the association should have applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for registration and obtained a seal in accordance with the law to be formally established. However, due to a lack of funds, it has been unable to proceed. Now is the time to revive the association, and all members of our industry should promptly pay the temporary fee of ten yuan that they have acknowledged, in order to proceed with registration in accordance with the law and join the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. A special meeting is scheduled for 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, the 25th of this month (the meeting will start on time, and latecomers will not be admitted; if you are unable to attend, please notify the association in writing), at the China National Products Maintenance Association in Gaodun Street, Nine Acres. We hope that your factory will attend on time to discuss matters together. This is our sincere hope."</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the labor dispute at the Japanese cotton mills remains unresolved. The Xihe factories went on strike again yesterday due to the dismissal of six foremen. Toyota and other cotton factories have announced that they will resume work today. The details are reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>Refusal to Eat and Shutdown</p>
<p>The strike of 3,400 workers at the Xihe First, Second, and Third factories, located at 74 Rue Robert, was resolved after mediation by Tan Baoshou, chief of the Caojiadu Public Security Branch, Wang Xianqing, director of the Mediation Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and various foremen. Work resumed on the evening of the 20th and the morning of the 21st. However, the workers expressed dissatisfaction because the management refused to meet their demands for eating and taking breaks.</p>
<p>Foremen Dismissed</p>
<p>At the same time, the factory issued a notice stating that the foremen Wang Han, Chen Guoyu, Li Baoquan, Zhou Daosheng, Yu Shoufan, and Sun Dequan were the instigators of the workers' strike. Therefore, they were dismissed and ordered to move out of the factory quarters by 5:00 p.m. on the 25th. The factory hoped that other workers would continue to work peacefully and not be misled by outsiders.</p>
<p>Strike Declared Again</p>
<p>Workers at the Xihe First, Second, and Third factories went on strike again yesterday in protest of the factory's refusal to meet their demands for eating and taking breaks and the dismissal of Wang Han and others, in order to urge the factory to realize its errors. At the same time, the names of all 3,400 workers were copied and sent to the management, stating that if the management wanted to dismiss Wang Han and the other six, they should dismiss all 3,400 workers.</p>
<p>Nine Demands Presented</p>
<p>After the workers at the First, Second, and Third factories went on strike, they held a meeting in the factory quarters at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. As a result of the discussions, they presented nine demands to the management: (1) Increase wages by 10%. (2) Allow 30 minutes for eating breaks. (3) For work on Sundays, workers should only work from 6:00 p.m. on Saturday to 6:00 a.m. on Sunday and should not work any longer (because they usually have to work until 12:00 a.m.). (4) Workers who work for half a month without stopping will receive an additional day of paid leave. (5) Workers should not be forced to work arbitrarily. (6) If new workers are hired, they should be recruited from the workers within the factory quarters. (7) Provide a rice subsidy of five jiao per month. (8) Workers should not be dismissed or driven out of the cooking areas in the factory quarters. (9) The personnel manager, Ikeda, should be dismissed immediately. If he is not dismissed, they vow not to resume work.</p>
<p>Petition to the Social Affairs Bureau This Morning</p>
<p>After the meeting, the workers immediately submitted the nine demands to the management, requesting their approval. However, there were no results. Therefore, the workers held another meeting at 6:00 p.m., and each factory appointed six representatives, for a total of 18, who were scheduled to submit a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau at 8:00 a.m. this morning, requesting the authorities to negotiate with the management and secure their agreement to these nine measures. If the management refuses, they are determined to continue the strike.</p>
<p>Notice of Resumption of Work This Morning</p>
<p>The workers' strike at the Toyota First and Second factories on Zhongyou Road has been going on for several days. After mediation by Mr. Du Yuesheng, the labor and management sides have also come closer to an agreement. In addition, the Toyota Interior and Exterior Cotton First and Second factories at 62 Rue Robert, which had stopped work due to a small number of workers, and the Toyota Interior and Exterior Cotton factories, yesterday simultaneously announced that they would resume work as usual at 6:00 a.m. this morning. The workers' side has also decided to resume work at that time.</p>
<p>Total Recovery in Pudong</p>
<p>In the Pudong area, the Shanghai First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth factories, which had suspended work the day before yesterday, resumed work as usual yesterday. Other factories, such as Gongda, Yufeng, Tongxing, Dakang, and Donghua, also resumed work as usual, and all workers returned to work. After the dispute was resolved, the original situation has now been restored.</p>

<p>Wu Baogen, a resident of Kongjia Lane in the Ximen Cheng Bing area, and Ding Axin, who operates a new ceremonial hall at 45 West Heng Street, Dongjiadu, both entrusted Dafu Plumbing Engineering Company to install water pipes for them to receive running water, paying deposit fees and water connection fees, etc. However, after many days, the water connection was delayed. After inquiring with the inland water company, they learned that the fees they had entrusted the plumbing company to pay had not been sent. Wu and Ding then reported to the Municipal Public Utility Bureau for relief. The bureau dispatched personnel to investigate on the 7th of this month. It was found that the company's director, Zhu Wenhao, had not been to the shop for two days, and his family had moved out a month ago. His plumbing business license was taken away by Zhu's father, Ciqing (the shop owner reported at the time of registration). At the time, only two workers, Shen Baoyuan and Zhu Shanyong, were minding the shop. When asked about the shop owner collecting deposit fees from customers and delaying the water connection, the workers did not deny it. The bureau then dispatched personnel to take one of the workers, Zhu Shanyong, into temporary custody at the Wenmiao Road Police Station of the Public Security Bureau and reported the findings to the bureau for review. The bureau concluded that the plumbing engineering company had indeed engaged in fraudulent behavior, which was illegal. It immediately ordered the company to temporarily surrender its plumbing business license and the licenses of the plumbers it employed to the bureau within [blank] days and to promptly return the deposit fees paid by the Wu and Ding families. At the same time, it sent a letter to the Wenmiao Road Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the worker Zhu Shanyong be released on bail and ordering the company to remove its signboard and cease operations immediately to prevent citizens from being deceived again.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Morphine Injection Leads to Sentencing <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Wu Jinbao, a woman from Wusong in her thirties, had an opium addiction, which she changed to eating red pills, and recently switched to injecting morphine. The woman is a prostitute and somewhat attractive, wearing fashionable clothes and shoes. Every night, she secretly works as a goddess in various hotels, often soliciting tourists in the Yangshupu area. Room 5 of the Dongfang Hotel at No. 26, Lane 642, East-West Huade Road, is her den for injecting morphine. Xu Fukai, an old man from Tongzhou living in a nearby alley, goes there every day at 9:00 p.m. to have Jinbao inject two doses into his legs without fail. This was discovered by Sun Baoshan, a Chinese detective of the Huishan Police Station. At 9:50 p.m. the night before last, he rushed to Room 26 of the Dongfang Hotel and arrested the injector, Xu Fukai, and Wu Jinbao, and brought them, along with a syringe and three small packages of morphine, to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case.

<p>The traffic lights at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession will be changed to automatic operation starting today. The difference from the original traffic lights is that the colors were originally only red and green and were managed by the police. Now they have been changed to automatic and do not require police management. The signal light changes from green to yellow, from yellow to red, and then from red back to green. When the light is green, vehicles can proceed straight through. When a vehicle approaching the intersection encounters a yellow light, it must quickly proceed to allow vehicles on the other intersecting road to proceed. If a vehicle needs to turn right, the driver must first signal the direction of travel with their hand and turn along the central pillar. It is not necessary to turn around the pillar as before. In areas where automatic traffic lights are in use, all drivers must pay special attention to the provisions of Article 31 of the traffic regulations, namely, to signal the direction of travel with their hand at all times to facilitate the passage of vehicles behind them. It is reported that these traffic lights are still being tested and will gradually be installed on major roads.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 8:15 AM, Patrol Officer Wang Zhongqing of the Lao Beimen Police Station led four patrol officers to examine pedestrians on various key roads within his jurisdiction. Near Kongjia Street inside Lao Ximen, they spotted a man wearing a blue short-sleeved cloth outfit approaching them. The man appeared very flustered. Suspecting the man’s appearance, they ordered him to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the man suddenly turned around and ran away. Knowing he was likely not a good person, the police immediately pursued him. At the entrance of Dechangtai Tobacco Shop at No. 107 Kongjia Alley, Tian Liangqi, the officer stationed at post No. 31, noticed the situation and bravely rushed forward to intercept him. In desperation, the bandit suddenly fired a shot from a handgun, resisting arrest. Officer Tian, caught off guard, was shot in the left leg, fell to the ground wounded, and the bandit used the opportunity to escape. The pursuit was unsuccessful. The wounded officer, Tian Liangqi, was then transported by vehicle to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment.</p>

<p>Jia Rongxiang, 42 years old, a Tianjin native and the owner of Shuang Yongxing Hardware Store at No. 10 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, took Yu Wang Hongmei, also known as Di Xiuying (22 years old this year), a woman from Liyang, as his concubine from a brothel three years ago. They did not formally marry but began living together at the store. Recently, Di became restless and secretly started a new relationship. On October 8th, while Jia was away in Tianjin, she took all of her clothing and cash, totaling over 1,900 yuan, and secretly ran away to live elsewhere. When Jia returned to Shanghai from Tianjin, he discovered the theft and reported it to the French Concession police, offering a reward for her capture through newspaper advertisements. After Di learned of this, fearing complications, she returned at the beginning of this month with the stolen items. Jia did not report the case closure to the police. This was discovered by Detective Qin Youyu and Detective Tao Ronglin, who arrested Di Xiuying and sent her to the Special No. 2 Court for investigation. The police department prosecuted her for theft. During the trial, the plaintiff stated that the defendant had returned all the items she had taken and that he intended to report the case closure to the police. The detectives had already arrested the defendant, and he now did not want to pursue the matter further. The defendant claimed she had taken the items back to her mother's house and was not attempting theft or escape. Judge Zhu Chuzhe reviewed the statements and deemed it appropriate to conclude the case. The verdict was handed down on the morning of the day before yesterday, sentencing Di Xiuying to two months imprisonment for theft, with a two-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>The Sino-American Benevolent Society (Chinese American Brotherhood of Youth), established in Beiping three years ago, comprises mostly Chinese and American youth. Its purpose is to connect youth from China and the United States. The Chinese headquarters, originally located in Beiping, moved to Shanghai a year ago. The American headquarters is located in Ithaca. With the arrival of Mr. Bai Mingte, the president of the Hong Kong branch, on a northern tour to Shanghai, the society's president, Mr. Smith, convened a board meeting ahead of schedule (originally scheduled for December 25th). It was held at Mr. Chen's residence on Qianwang Temple Road in Hangzhou the day before yesterday. The next term's officers were elected, resulting in the election of Chen Guangxiang as president, Edward (American) as secretary, Li Shiguang as treasurer, and Jiang Jingniu as information officer. It was also decided that the next annual meeting will be held in southern China, with the location to be further discussed by the board. Finally, it was passed to nominate Chen Guangxiang and Kong Xiangmin to participate in the winter gathering of the North China branch. The members of the society who went to Hangzhou came to Shanghai yesterday morning. The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, to examine the achievements of various organizations in implementing the "Three Reforms" lifestyle, issued forms and sent letters to various organizations requesting them to fill them out. However, some organizations did not fill them out by the deadline. The association sent another reminder letter yesterday, which read: "This association previously printed a report form on the achievements of various Shanghai organizations in implementing the 'Three Reforms' lifestyle in early August to examine the implementation of the 'Three Reforms' lifestyle by various organizations. The forms were sent separately, or sent by the competent authority for forwarding and filling out, with the requirement to fill them out and return them within two months. Now, the deadline has long passed, but the report form from your × has not been filled out and submitted. Therefore, we are sending a special reminder letter, along with two additional forms. We hope that you will immediately instruct your staff to handle this matter promptly and return them to this association for review, in the spirit of public service. Sincerely." At noon, a gathering was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ai on Avenue Joffre. According to Kong Ruman, a reporter from Dagong Bao, he will accompany Mr. Chen to Beiping in two months.</p>

<p>Since the passing of literary giant Mr. Lu Xun, his posthumous works have been extremely popular. Recently, Beixin Bookstore, represented by lawyer Sun Zuji, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District District Court against Zhang Xinshan of Longhu Bookstore on Shandong Road for copyright infringement, claiming that Beixin had signed contracts with Lu Xun to publish all of his books during his lifetime, and had obtained copyright registration certificates from the Ministry of Interior. These books were widely sold. However, the defendant, intending to gain illegal profits, arbitrarily altered the titles of the books and privately printed and sold them, infringing on the copyright. The plaintiff requested that the defendant be summoned to court and severely punished according to law, and that his counterfeit books be confiscated. Since the defendant infringed on the copyright, the sales of the original books have sharply declined, resulting in losses totaling over ten thousand yuan. The plaintiff also requested that the defendant be ordered to pay compensation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff's lawyer, Sun Zuji, completed his statement of the indictment and stated that the case was currently being mediated outside the court, requesting a postponement. The court then ordered a postponement to the afternoon of the 24th of this month for a retrial.</p>

Chairman Zhang Yunfang delivered an opening speech, and Zhao Xianji, the director of citizen training, reported on the preparation and training process. Then, Mr. Chen Shixia stood up and delivered a speech, stating that citizen training has three main points: strengthening physical health to dispel the criticism of being a "sick man of Asia," mastering technical skills to defend against foreign aggression, and cultivating a lively spirit to serve society and the country. One should practice at all times, consistently, and progress daily, so as not to betray the government's intention in giving the people the opportunity to train, not to betray the association's provision of training opportunities for the trainees, and not to betray the knowledge that you have gained through hard work for three months. His words were very inspiring, and the applause was like thunder. After Mr. Chen finished presenting the medals to the trainees who had not missed any classes, the association's previous one-day sports event was entirely responsible for fundraising by the trainees, with excellent results. The trainees' enthusiasm and perseverance in serving society and the country should all be commended, and each was also given a medal as encouragement.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Settlement of Interest on Repayment of Loan - Legal Issues Arise - Shen Yuqing Files for Retrial <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jinkun and Shen Yuqing had a loan dispute, and Zhang filed a lawsuit against Shen in the First Special District District Court. The case has already been judged in two trials, ordering Shen to repay the principal of 500 yuan, and interest calculated at 1.5% per month from the date the loan was established to the date of execution. This case is considered to be of minimal value, and according to law, two trials are the final verdict. Therefore, Shen intends to repay the principal and interest. However, when calculating the amount, he found some flaws in the interest part: (1) If the judgment is to be fulfilled, calculated from January 1, 1926, the date the loan was established, to the date of the second instance judgment of the High Court, it would require more than 610 yuan. This is more than 100 yuan more than the regulations of Article 5 of the Civil Code and the Implementation Law of the Clearing Debt Section, as well as the precedents of the Supreme Court of one interest per principal. If calculated to the date of execution, the amount exceeded would be even greater. (2) The loan was originally a fixed-term loan with a term of one year. Zhang only filed a lawsuit five years after the expiration of the term, and never demanded payment before the lawsuit. Therefore, the interest within the overdue period is also worthy of research. Now Shen believes that the above two points have not been properly considered before, so he is still unwilling to accept the final judgment. However, according to law, this case can only be tried in two trials, and it is impossible to appeal to the first instance again. To seek relief, it is inconvenient to raise an objection to the execution court, and it is also inappropriate to file a lawsuit to confirm the interest separately. After discussing with others, it was decided to request the High Court of the original trial to apply the provisions of Articles 492, 3, and 4 of the retrial procedure, that is, to retrial the case. Currently, what is being contested is purely a legal question. I don't know if a retrial can be granted.</p>

<p>Shops on New Nanking Road in the Public Concession, due to the recent economic downturn and the sight of numerous beggars on the streets, begging from door to door, and demanding money aggressively, found it unbearable. Therefore, the 16th District Civic Association recently produced a type of alms token, resembling the water tokens used at tiger stove businesses. They are stamped with "New Nanking Road Alms Token 4 Cash" and "16th District Civic Association" on the back. These have been distributed to the shops. After beggars obtain these tokens, they can redeem them for copper coins at the 16th District Civic Association. However, after the issuance of these tokens, shops generally say that since each token is only worth 4 small cash and requires a trip to the Civic Association for redemption, a lot of beggars are unwilling to take them, throwing the tokens back. Therefore, this may reduce the number of beggars.</p>

<p>The New Drug Industry Association submitted a letter to the Ministry of Health of the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "Shanghai is a commercial hub. Hospitals and pharmacies in the interior need narcotics and narcotic preparations, most of which are purchased from Shanghai. Since the establishment of the Ministry's Narcotics Management Office, all purchasers of narcotics must apply directly to the Management Office, and all pharmacies have been notified to comply. Recently, pharmacies have repeatedly stated that purchasing these drugs from Beijing is far away, the procedures are complicated, and postal delivery is delayed, often causing delays and hindering the market, which affects the lives of patients. We request that you consider the difficulties of business and establish a sub-management office in Shanghai and issue a distribution license, so that nearby purchases can be made and directly mailed to various locations, to avoid detours." Upon discussion at the meeting, the points mentioned are indeed factual, and it is appropriate to submit a document to the Ministry of Health for review and approval of the request for public convenience.

A large batch of French velvet and gold and silver wax yarns has also arrived, most suitable for noble ladies' clothing in early winter. The men's suits and inner shirt materials are so exquisite that even foreign shops rarely have them. The hired technicians are also first-class in Shanghai, so Westerners are constantly visiting to order. Customers have been flooding in every day, and everyone is satisfied.

After examination, the Jushi diagnosed that it was due to a weakness in the large intestine, and that it must have been caused by failure to recuperate after suffering from dysentery in his early years. According to Committee Member Zhu, he not only suffered from dysentery but also had a very severe case of malaria. He greatly admired the Jushi's accurate diagnosis.

<p>— Edited by China Credit Information</p>
<p>The production process of enamel products can be divided into nine steps: 1. Making the blank, that is, assembling iron sheets into iron pieces, placing them on various types of ramming machines to form various models, such as cups, plates, basins, and bowls, then polishing them or welding them. 2. Making powder, that is, mixing raw materials such as feldspar and clay according to a formula, then grinding them through a spring mortar and other procedures, and then placing them in cold water for six hours to obtain crystalline powder blocks of various colors. Enamel powder is made by grinding this powder block with water. 3. Washing the blank, that is, removing impurities from the iron blank. One method is to burn it off with furnace fire, and the other is to wash it with 12% sulfuric acid to prepare it for enameling. 4. Enameling, that is, applying the slurry-like enamel powder to the dry and clean iron blank and then baking it in a hot fire of about 1,000 degrees to form a plain enamel product. 5. Artification, if necessary, the completed plain enamel product still needs to go through lettering, painting, and spraying to beautify it.</p>
<p>2. Past and Present of Shanghai's Enamel Industry Enamel products were originally imported goods. In the past, the annual import value was always between three and four million yuan, a substantial leakage. In recent years, due to the patriotic imitation of manufacturing by Chinese people, the annual imports have been no more than one million yuan, a decrease of two-thirds or three-quarters compared to the past, which is a major progress in China's industry. Nineteen of China's self-operated enamel factories are concentrated in Shanghai. Shanghai's existence of enamel factories has only been about twenty years. In 1916, an American (named McCree) first established a large factory in Gujia, Zhabei, specializing in the production of enamel mouth cups and food utensils. Later, due to unfamiliarity with Chinese business conditions, the factory was taken over by Shanghai merchant Xu Daosheng and others, and reorganized into the Zhufeng Enamel Company, and the scope of business was also expanded compared to the past. By the spring of 1924, the factory was taken over by Tong Shiheng of Jiading, renamed Zhufeng Tongji Enamel Company, and has remained so to this day. In addition, when the Guangda factory had not yet been reorganized, a Guangda factory followed, but it closed down after only a few months. Dong Jifu of Suzhou took over the remaining business and reorganized it into Yifeng Enamel Factory. Subsequently, Dingfeng Enamel Factory west of Xin Zha Bridge, Hongkou Industrial and Commercial Company jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese merchants, and the enamel department attached to the Chinese Vocational School also rose up one after another. From 1927 to 1929, Rixin Enamel Factory and Huafeng Enamel Factory also followed, but except for Huafeng, the rest did not develop and grow. Those not closing down were reorganized. As for small factories that appeared briefly, such as Hengfeng, Huasheng, Yaohua, Zhenhua, Yonghe, and Dafeng, they are even less worth mentioning. Therefore, at present, the enamel factories in Shanghai with larger scale, better equipment, and wider sales are only Zhufeng, Huafeng, Yifeng, and Zhonghua, about seven or eight factories in total. Now, their individual status is selected and allocated below:</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups were slightly less than before, with a total of over fifty firms arriving, totaling 11,230 piculs of goods. Sales in this area were normal, but there was continued activity in bagged rice. It is estimated that the Xi'an group took over 2,000 bags of thick粳 rice, and the Pingjin and Qingyan groups purchased over 5,000 bags of thin indica rice. Therefore, the market conditions for thick粳 and thin indica rice have returned to stable. Dujiangjian suddenly fell by 5 to 10 cents due to oversupply. The price of Yinbian Yuan was mediocre.</p>

<p>(Zhabei) Yesterday, about thirty rice boats from various rivers arrived. Trading in the market was still sluggish. The opening price for new粳 rice was slightly soft. Early rice was stable. Thin indica rice from both local and other provinces was selling well, and the price was firm. Meibu Jian was selling very actively, and the price was slightly tight. The stock of Bian Yuan on the river was abundant, but sales were not strong, and the price was down by a few cents. The prices of other goods remained largely unchanged.</p>

<p>Western sea cucumbers and the production of the sea cucumbers in various places this year have been low, so the supply of new goods have greatly decreased, and what remains in the market is limited and uneven in quality. Often, there is a lack of supply to meet customer demand. The current selling prices in the market have gradually become tight: two-branch Jinshan plum blossom sea cucumber is priced at $410, three-branch at $290, four-branch at $340, six-branch at $305, Wangjiashu small plum blossom sea cucumber at $190, medium-sized at $211, large-sized at $245, Jinding bird wrinkle sea cucumber at $384, large-sized at $287, six-eight-branch Jin Hongxue sea cucumber at $285, Jinding red stripe sea cucumber at $202, large-sized at $188, medium-sized at $170, small-sized at $152, top black red sea cucumber at $167, large-sized at $156, four-branch Jin Fanwu sea cucumber at $242, eight-branch at $232, ten-branch at $216, twelve-branch at $200, four-six-branch Wang Wu Yuan sea cucumber at $204, eight-branch at $186, ten-branch at $176, twelve-branch at $165, top gray rock sea cucumber at $190, medium-sized at $138, top white rock sea cucumber at $170, large-sized at $152, medium-sized at $125, elephant trunk sea cucumber at $75.</p>

<p>The progress of human thought is also the elevation of social status. The loss of thought in the world is greater than the loss of all material things.</p>
<p>There are more useful thoughts buried in the world than there are useful thoughts that have been realized.</p>
<p>We cannot estimate how much benefit society would gain if all the good thoughts of people were brought out.</p>
<p>People's thoughts are generally the same for good concepts, and generally the same for bad concepts.</p>
<p>Many people only know the poverty of lacking money, but do not know the poverty of lacking thought!</p>
<p>If thought has not increased, and there is only more income of money, it is still just a fool.</p>
<p>The vast world cannot be governed by narrow thoughts. The beautiful world cannot be stained by wrong thoughts.</p>
<p>The life of the world depends on thought. Thought can make the world a hell, and it can also make the world a paradise.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Anecdotes of Executive Duan (Qing Qu) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Duan Zhiquan passed away in Shanghai, and people at home and abroad mourned him. His outstanding political achievements are countless, a true great man of his time. Now, some anecdotes of his life are recorded as follows, hoping to satisfy those who admire him.</p>
<p>Mr. Duan first graduated from the Beiyang Military Academy in the eleventh year of Emperor Guangxu's reign. Afterwards, he traveled to Germany and studied military science in Berlin. Not long after, he returned to China, and Yuan Shikai of Xiangcheng established the Beiyang New Army, training soldiers in Xiaozhan. Mr. Duan was appointed as the commander of the first artillery battalion and superintendent of the Army Academy. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong, he was appointed as the Jiangbei Regional Commander. It was said that the position of Jiangbei Regional Commander was a stepping stone to promotion. Wang Shizhen also ascended from this position to guard the capital, and everyone congratulated Mr. Duan. Subsequently, Mr. Duan was ordered to enter Beijing and gradually rose to power in the military. However, after Mr. Duan left office, he was succeeded by Lei Zhenchun, who ultimately failed due to bribery. The land was not unlucky, but the person was not outstanding, and people laughed at it.</p>
<p>When the European War broke out, some people criticized Mr. Duan for declaring war without actually fighting. However, his efforts did enhance China's international standing, which was no small achievement. People called him "Mr. Ganmu" because, at that time, those around him were engaging in infighting. Figures like Xu Shuzheng and Jin Yunpeng were all Mr. Duan's advisors, but they could not avoid conflicts due to power struggles, which also cannot be concealed for the sake of virtuous men. In the autumn of the changing political situation, those in power in the former capital often suffered from two common ailments: selfishness and extravagance. Selfishness led them to make decisions based on personal likes and dislikes, blurring the lines between the virtuous and the treacherous. Extravagance led them to squander resources, causing the national treasury to dwindle. Although the political manifestations of these two ailments differed, the suffering was the same. Mr. Duan did not pursue vain fame but sought practical results. In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic, he was one of the best among the mediocre officials.</p>
<p>During the second and third years of the Republic, it was very common to hold birthday celebrations for officials. Figures like Yang Xizi and Liang Rengong used their family celebrations as an excuse to hold banquets and operas for days, with congratulatory gifts often amounting to hundreds of gold coins. Extravagance reached an extreme, as if they could not show off to society or entertain their relatives without doing so. At that time, Mr. Duan was approaching his fiftieth birthday, and his subordinates wanted to celebrate his birthday. Mr. Duan was furious upon hearing this and personally wrote a letter to Xu Shuzheng, saying, "Brother Youzheng, I recently saw a report about celebrating my birthday, which is truly ignorant of the big picture. We are constantly worried about failing to achieve our goals, even while enduring hardship. The stove fire is blazing, and we are still enjoying playing with the pot. Our achievements are unremarkable, and our transgressions are increasing. How can we explain ourselves to the world? Since the literary association has been established, we should not engage in excessive actions. There is no need to write essays and compile them into volumes. I have already received many gifts. I hope you will treat me with virtue and kindly decline the offers from our friends. If you do that, my heart will be at ease. I can only ask you to issue an order to prohibit it. We have known each other for many years, and you should trust me deeply. Please make corrections and offer your best wishes. Greetings, Duan Zhiquan." From this, we can see Mr. Duan's integrity, which is hard to find today.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Cartoon Map (Qiu Shen) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Returning from the cartoon exhibition, what constantly echoes in my mind are several cartoon maps.</p>
<p>One is Gao Longsheng's "The Country is Broken, But the Mountains and Rivers Remain." The picture is extremely simple. On plain paper, only the edges of a black Begonia leaf are drawn. The entire leaf is dyed red. The heartbroken author has broken through many stinging holes in the northeastern corner of the red leaf. Do not misunderstand that this piece of song paper is an abandoned remnant painting. This is an antique of thousands of years, trampled on by fierce and greedy wolves!</p>
<p>The author of "Solar Eclipse Picture" is Liu Yi. The meaning of the picture is that the moon covers the sun and becomes a partial eclipse. The sunlight only radiates the territories outside the Great Wall. In other places, people are watching the solar eclipse with their hands in their sleeves. Friends! Don't be greedy for a good look! Wake up from your dreams of complacency!</p>
<p>Near the port, I saw Jiang Mi's "Foreign Goods in China." It was a national map of provinces cut and pieced together with genuine foreign cloth scraps. I think the author took great pains and effort. Who wouldn't like this colorful and brilliant foreign cloth? Friends! This is the bright color of wild flowers, and you will wear the poison of guns and cannons.</p>
<p>Returning from the cartoon exhibition, I grieve for our map!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Remembering Chrysanthemums (Yan Qiao) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Chrysanthemums are called "yellow flowers." The yellow chrysanthemums are called "yellow flowers," which is doubly apt. "Huang" refers to Mr. Yuezhou, the owner of the Huang Family Ranch in Zhenru. On the 15th, the host invited Xiangdong to a gathering. I was unable to attend due to other engagements. On the 19th, I drove with Juan Lengyue and Jiren to Qiansu. The host treated us to food and drink, hoping to see the culmination of his twenty years of hard work. There were countless famous and excellent flowers, but the chrysanthemums that had been irrigated and cultivated for eight months were especially strong in the autumn, with a refreshing and pleasant fragrance. I am glad that this trip was not in vain.</p>
<p>The host's cultivation of chrysanthemums has its own unique approach, generally divided into two categories. One category consists of large potted chrysanthemums, with some having over a hundred blooms, all full like the prime of youth, piled up like mountains, and dazzlingly bright. The other category consists of single chrysanthemums in small jars, about the same height, with flowers larger than bowls, all full of vitality, each with its own unique and proud appearance. Therefore, the thatched hut is full of vitality, forming a separate world within the three hundred acres of vegetable gardens, forests, and trees.</p>
<p>Tao An's "Dream Memories" records that Zhang's chrysanthemum sea in Yanzhou has clouds: "The flowers are as big as porcelain bowls, all spherical, all first-class, all golden and silver lotus petals, with colors that are fresh and different from ordinary flowers, and the green leaves are layered, with not a single leaf falling off early. This is the way of heaven, the power of the soil, and the labor of man, and none can be missing." Huang's chrysanthemums are worthy of this description without shame. Moreover, the host knows the nature of chrysanthemums, can obtain seeds for planting, and can use bee media for hybridization, with new flowers every year, which is in line with the science of eugenics, which Zhang did not achieve.</p>
<p>Shou Juan also loves flowers like his life, hence the name "Flower Fool of Wumen." He lingered, reluctant to leave. The host said that there are still dozens of plants left in the fields, to be enjoyed with plum blossoms next spring. This is enough to boast about the creation of art.</p>
<p>The host is fifty-six years old, talks jovially, and is hospitable. Upon parting, he warmly said that the chrysanthemums have not yet faded. If any friends have a hermit's inclination, they are welcome to come in these months, and I will greet them with open arms.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Suzhou Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition (Ziwei) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Wang Feiji Wuzhou Road Park in Suzhou has a goldfish and chrysanthemum exhibition every year during the off-season to decorate this desolate park. The park management office first seeks famous varieties of products, which are divided into the East and West Pavilions. The exhibition period is four days. I went to see it from Shanghai on the last day.</p>
<p>The tables in the West Pavilion are arranged in a claw shape, covered with white carpets, which are very elegant and clean. The exhibitors occupy one table each, with pots and bowls arranged in rows and clearly labeled. Among them, the pearl fish of the Sun family in Sijing Lane are the best, with colors of red, white, and floral patterns divided into dragon, egg, grass, and other types. The pearls on the fish's body are countable. Another large tank contains two pairs of three-year-old floral pearls, which are five inches long, and the pearls are even more refined and dazzling. A table of Ziluolan An is displayed under the north window. The glass and porcelain tanks are of various forms, and many are decorated with delicate frames, with flower branches and bonsai set off on the side, which feels antique and unique. Ziluolan fish has long been the community of Wuzhong, and other such as Beijing Five Flowers, colorful, I am afraid it is difficult to match for a time. The fish in the park are all five or six years old, old and old, and weighed by the catty, not easy to see outside, and indeed very precious.</p>
<p>Small chrysanthemums are displayed in the library. The tables are tall and arched, with many new varieties, such as the "Autumn Fragrance," "Green Sea Spring Light," "Smiling Face," "Moonlight," "Four Seas Ascending Peace," and "Pine Clouds Drunk Moon" of Zhihua Garden. Jin Cheng Garden's "Green Mountain Hanging Snow." Others such as Ziluolan An's "Tiger Whisker," "Zhou Ding Shang Yi," "Glass Emerald," "Purple Clothes Spotting Snow," "Xi Shi Spring Sleep," "Qian Chun Sha," "Spring Water Green Wave," "Natural," "Jade Butterfly," "Eighteen Scholars," "Maple Leaf Reed Flowers," "Maid," The Suzhou Telephone Bureau's "Lao Jun Mei", "Great Emperor Hui", "Ink Lotus", "Fragrant Snow Sea", "Old Green Hair" etc. are all special products of this year, which are not easy to see elsewhere. Mr. Ye Yuhu of Dongmei Lane's "Disheveled Hair Fairy Chang", "Jade Ruyi", "Crane Dance Cloud Zero", Qin Fang Garden's "Fu Guo Madam" are classic works among the old seeds, and are also praised by everyone. Other such as the Ganoderma lucidum planted by Mr. Huang Naizhen of Cha Jiaqiao, no less than ten pots in size, the vision of the new people is quite extraordinary. The various potted landscapes of the Guiyou Art Planting Society use small bamboo mountains and chrysanthemums with ancient bricks as the base pots, which are precious, likeable, and particularly interesting. The East Pavilion is a pile of chrysanthemum mountains, as high as the eaves, looking from afar, it is really a full flower tomb, colorful, a great spectacle, and there is a faint fragrance, coming from the breeze, it is indeed a separate joy, making people want to linger. In this cool and not cold weather, the park has such a grand event embellishment, naturally skirts fluttering, tourists gathered in clouds, can break the silent air.</p>

<p>On the Mid-Autumn Night of Bingzi, looking at the moon and remembering the old times, fondly remembering Mr. Jiansheng, Delin, Xuchu and other friends of the year who shared the same joys and sorrows, The Lay Buddhist of Shanshan.</p>
<p>The bright moon in mid-autumn is so sentimental, free to rise and fall, free to shine, ten thousand miles of vast sky are the same color, very round night is in the third watch, remotely pitying the tight west wind in Guijiao, sitting and watching the horizontal Big Dipper in Yan Yun, alone on horseback in the mountains and rivers, people are about to grow old, who else will ask the common people about their lives?</p>
<p>The autumn of dragons and tigers fighting in Linghai, I learned from Li Bai and climbed the building, raising my cup to invite the moon into a lonely reward, borrowing chopsticks and ashamed of my clumsy plan, hiding my tracks and not following the black leopard's concealment, dispelling soldiers and finally accompanying Chisong to travel, the figure in the car like a knowing returning bird, where to rest on the north and south mountains?</p>

<p>Eighth Episode: A cup of water pledges the heart, a blue lamp speaks of haggardness, golden hooks point fingers, red beans report lovesickness.</p>
<p>In this burst of wild laughter, the conversation between the two young ladies came to an end. When Youmei bid farewell to Menglan the next morning, she shook her hand and said, "When I first sent the message to you, I hoped that you would have a real expression for him." Menglan said, "You are leaving now, and I don't have time to write a letter." Youmei said, "You can let me take something you love to him, so that when he sees your things, he will believe what I said, and that's it." Menglan said, "What you said is a bit untenable. Do all the things I use have my seal on them? Otherwise, how would he recognize them?" Youmei laughed: "Oh! You reminded me. The thing you send him cannot be ambiguous, there must be a mark to prove it." Menglan said, "How can I send something with a mark on it to someone?" Youmei said, "Marks should be divided into two levels. If it is obvious, then naturally it is not convenient for others to see. If it is a secret mark, it doesn't matter if you send it out, right?" Menglan gently touched her face with her hand, making a pensive gesture and smiling. Youmei saw the hand she raised, and on the ring finger, she wore a gold ring, and laughed: "Is there your name on your ring?" Menglan said: "Although there is no name, there are two English letters on it." Youmei said: "What do English letters have to do with anything? One letter can represent dozens of words. Let me see what the two letters are." Menglan did not think about his request and casually took it off and handed it to Youmei. Youmei clamped it with two fingers and looked at the words inside the ring, and laughed: "One M, one L. Is this Menglan's abbreviation? Old Bao said something, if I hadn't taken this ring from your finger, I would never have thought it was yours. Let me take this thing away." (100)</p>

<p>Facing the rustling morning breeze, under the hazy morning mist, I carried a "Selection of Modern Essays" and walked onto that murderous Jiangwan Road. As usual, what appeared before my eyes first was that shocking monster, its terrible blood basin mouth wide open, as if it wanted to swallow the world.</p>
<p>On the side of the road, the rows of trees lining the road were like sentry guards standing in formation, densely arranged; next to it was a place for "allies' warriors" to "return their souls," but in front of the park gate was quiet, unlike some days when you could see several "allied women" wearing black dresses going inside to bow ninety-something degrees to offer flowers.</p>
<p>The whistle of the North Railway Station pierced the static air, causing those wanderers who had been drifting in foreign lands for a long time, or the travelers who were singing farewell songs, to stir up endless melancholy in their lonely hearts!</p>
<p>Stepping on the fallen leaves blown down by the autumn wind, it felt as if I was treading on my own heart, making me feel helpless: Although I was still walking forward step by step, I had lost the courage to move forward. I doubted in my heart, thinking that I was no longer in the beautiful Jiangnan, but had arrived in the north under the assault of storms, no, I even suspected that I had left the ancient country with more than 4,000 years of history. But in the end, with that tense and fearful heart, I quietly passed through the bayonets of the "allied warriors" and walked to the entrance of Hongkou Park, took out my "pass" from my pocket, waved it at the patrolman watching, and then slipped in sideways. It has been more than a month since I last came to Hongkou Park; in the past, when I lived on Di Siwei Road, this place had almost become my family garden. Reading in the morning, fishing at noon, walking in the evening, I spent more than a third of my time here every day. Sometimes, I would talk with a few friends inside, or have a disorganized picnic. But now, the distance from my address is of course one reason, but there is also the fact that I really don't have the courage to run to this terrible place.</p>
<p>What I saw today was the same soft, grassy lawns, winding paths, clear and calm ponds, withered and haggard lotus, scattered forests, and intricately decorated flowers as before. There was not much change, but the situation in the park was obviously a bit "desolate in front of the door"! In such a large park, in addition to many majestic "armed allied comrades" and "allied men and women," there were also a few "foreign gentlemen" playing golf. I didn't meet a single one of our own compatriots. I silently walked along the small river, as if I were a ghost in a desolate tomb, and an unnamed feeling had secretly climbed into my subconscious mind. I didn't understand what kind of world it was now. Is it civilization? Is it considered civilized behavior to forcibly snatch other people's things and make them your own, and not allow others to shout a word of "no"? Is it barbarism? But they all wear a good-looking mask and put on a civilized coat, making people deceived without knowing it. If it weren't for people in civilized countries, how could there be such superb skills?</p>
<p>With a melancholic mood, I sat down on the edge of a pond with my limp limbs, but the sadness of a slave could not disappear in my heart: Watching the "allied children" leisurely fishing for shrimp by the pond for fun, I felt as ashamed as if I had been slapped twice in the face, and this shame would never let me forget it.</p>
<p>Past wounds, current impressions, I really dare not think about it, so, I slipped out of the gate of Hongkou Park as if I were escaping.</p>

<p>Everybody Go to the Front Lines To Have a Brave Spirit - To Avenge and Wipe Out Humiliation!</p>
<p>To Have Superior Intelligence - To Be Self-Reliant and Independent!</p>
<p>Youths, Rise Up! Vigorously Extinguish the Neurasthenia That Destroys Vitality!</p>
<p>Everyone, our country has suffered national disasters. National sentiment is agitated. The masses are indignant. The whole country, from top to bottom, are all loudly calling out the slogan of "Reviving the Nation." This patriotic phenomenon certainly comes from a genuine outpouring of emotion. It is undeniable. But, the work of saving the country is not just about giving speeches, sending telegrams, posting slogans, chanting slogans, and demonstrating with empty hands. This is useless. In other words, empty words cannot defend against the enemy's planes and cannons. The result will not be victory. We must have superior energy and a healthy brain to be able to control planes, command cannons, fight on the battlefield, use strategies, and conquer strong enemies. If we do not have a healthy body and a strong spirit to fight, then we can say that the result will also be failure. The unhealthy physique of the people is enough to affect the unsound foundation of the country. This is a reality in the "survival of the fittest." No one can deny it.</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the country, every man is responsible." At this time when the national situation is on the verge of danger and the situation is urgent, all of us compatriots must prepare to go to the front lines. In particular, young people, as those responsible for shouldering the important task of saving the country, must have a brave spirit and a healthy physique. Then, they can avenge and wipe out humiliation and become a self-reliant and independent people.</p>
<p>The cultural conditions of a country and a nation are not material, but spiritual. A person without spirit is without a soul. Can a person without a soul still survive? A country without spirit is without a national soul. Can a country without a national soul survive in the world?</p>
<p>Look, many of the young people in our country's society today are spiritually listless and physically weak. According to the facts obtained from various investigations, the majority of these young people are suffering from neurasthenia. Therefore, whether they are students or office workers, they feel extremely tired when reading, writing, or serving. In less than a few hours, they experience various pains such as headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and back pain. As a result, their energy is insufficient, and they can only muddle along, often being late or absent. Their performance is very poor. How can such people shoulder the heavy responsibility of defending the country and resisting the enemy during wartime? Therefore, we must take this opportunity to awaken the youth of the whole country to assume the responsibility of saving the country. First, we must cultivate a healthy spirit and a strong physique. Uplift our national spirit to work hard in reality and strive for the final victory of the war. This can be a great act of saving the country and preserving its existence.</p>
<p>At present, the lives of most young people in our country who are suffering from neurasthenia are completely out of date. Discouragement, disappointment, and depravity all stem from a lack of a healthy spirit. This is what is called a person who only has a shell but no soul. In this way, our country and our nation will be destroyed by themselves without the invasion of foreigners. Therefore, if we want to save the country and strive for survival, we must pay attention to the health of young people. We must adopt an active attitude to eradicate neurasthenia and awaken the general patients to work hard on the two key points of exercise and recuperation. Now I would like to recommend a special treatment for neurasthenia to the readers. If you want to have the health of new vitality, you can only take "Memory Neurotic" regularly, which nourishes and strengthens the nerves. It can relieve your diseases and pains, and sow health and happiness. It is the supreme contribution of modern science. By infusing you with this new life agent, "Memory Neurotic", you can get the marrow of life. Then, the previously weak and depressed body and mind will be transformed into vigorous and striving ones, embarking on the road of revival.</p>

<p>Doctors from all over the world now unanimously recognize that only organ preparations (Pulmo-Live) are the only savior for tuberculosis.</p>
<p>In recent years, new theories on the treatment of tuberculosis with kerosene have been frequently seen in Japanese magazines, and kerosene preparations have been popular at the time. It is known that although many people take it, very few are cured, and most people experience vomiting and diarrhea, or even die as a result. Therefore, it was suddenly banned by the authorities. Afterwards, experts used animals for experiments, administering it internally or by injection. Within a few days, all the experimental animals died. After dissection, the organs of the animals all showed pathological changes, and the lungs also showed blood stasis. Therefore, kerosene lung treatment agents will no longer be seen by the world.</p>
<p>Most tuberculosis patients know that the lungs are attacked by bacilli, leading to tuberculosis or ulcers in the lungs, and finally the respiratory organs are destroyed and life is not preserved. Therefore, the drugs taken are nothing more than bactericidal. However, they do not know that the victory over this disease depends entirely on the patient's own natural resistance. Drugs are secondary. However, since suffering from tuberculosis, the lung's resistance is not enough to fight the bacilli, the resistance becomes weaker day by day, and the bacilli become more abusive day by day, and the disease becomes longer and longer. Therefore, taking organ preparations can stop the activity of the bacilli and replenish the lung's resistance, so that the bacilli are eliminated without being killed, and the disease is cured without being treated. Therefore, organ preparations have been popular in the world for a long time, curing countless tuberculosis cases. Therefore, world-renowned doctors recognize it as the only special effective treatment for tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Organ therapy was invented in ancient times both in China and abroad. Ancient Indian methods used goat blood to treat chlorosis, and ancient Chinese prescriptions used seal genitals to treat sexual dysfunction, and human placenta to treat weakness. However, scientific methods were not clear, and the essence could not be extracted and the dross removed, so the benefits could not be accurate. The recently popular Fhith, Weai "Pulmo-Live" is an organ preparation made by scientific methods, and it is also a special effective drug that must be effective for treating tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The main raw materials of Phith weai "Pulmo-Live" are fresh hormones extracted from the spleen and lungs of strong animals, which are important components to increase the patient's natural resistance and enrich the lung's function to defend against bacilli. The lesions are built into a model fence, and the bacilli are sealed. The bacilli cannot move in the model fence, and the nutrition is cut off, and the attack power of white blood cells is enhanced. The bacilli are under heavy pressure, although they are stubborn and fierce, they have not died out. Therefore, any serious tuberculosis, although the doctors are helpless and have entered the final stage, after taking "Pulmo-Live", the appetite increases, breathing is smooth, night sweats are relieved, hemoptysis stops, and other symptoms such as night sweats; coughing; chest pain, etc. gradually decrease, and the turning point is seen day by day, and soon it will be completely healthy and return to health. Its great power and rapid efficacy are truly unexpected and make people stop in amazement. Moreover, it is peaceful in nature and has no side effects. Internal use and self-treatment are extremely convenient. Those who have been reborn from tuberculosis by taking "Pulmo-Live" are countless and cannot be counted. Praise and guarantee texts are scattered in newspapers and magazines in various countries, and they are easily available. The medical and pharmaceutical circles in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries praise it even more.</p>

<p>Lungs! Are respiratory organs Heart! Are circulatory organs The danger of both heart and lung diseases is well known!</p>
<p>Asthma, known in traditional Chinese medicine as qi asthma, is characterized by rapid and labored breathing, profuse cold sweats on the forehead and back, a suffocating feeling in the chest, inability to lie down, and difficulty speaking. The pain is difficult to describe in words. The causes of this disease are extremely complex, with most cases being caused by diseases of the bronchi. Prolonged coughing will naturally damage the lungs, and the heart will also become fatigued, leading to heart weakness. Over time, the heart enlarges, compressing the lungs, causing difficulty breathing and asthma. Therefore, those with prolonged coughs or tuberculosis will often suffer from heart disease. If left untreated or treated improperly, dangerous asthma is inevitable. Because the heart and lungs have a relationship of regulating carbon and oxygen, they are mutually causal, so lung diseases and heart diseases are related. Asthma is caused by both the heart and lungs. If not careful, it can lead to death. The degree of danger is truly imminent.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Two Major Reasons for the Development of Modern Income Tax <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Lingyun</p>
<p>— Wartime Finance and Social Policy —</p>
<p>Since its emergence in England in 1798, income tax has been adopted by countries worldwide. Over the past century, its rapid development and widespread implementation have far surpassed other types of taxes. In modern times, it has gradually become the central pillar of the tax system in most countries. Examining the reasons for its development, one aspect is the inherent qualities of income tax as a good tax, while the objective reason lies in the evolution of the social economy. Since the late 18th century, European countries have been plagued by frequent wars. From the Napoleonic Wars to the Crimean War, the Franco-Prussian War, and finally, World War I, unrest has been constant for over a century. Even in peacetime, all political organizations and economic systems are preparing for war, so it would not be an exaggeration to call it the "century of war." In this environment, the fiscal policies of various countries have focused on expanding military preparations in peacetime and planning wartime expenditures, with little else worth mentioning. Expanding military preparations in peacetime allows for leisurely planning of expenses, and the amounts are not fixed, allowing for adjustments based on the financial situation. However, planning wartime expenditures involves huge amounts and urgent needs, which was the most difficult challenge for those in charge of finance at the time. Therefore, contemporary financiers focused on the problem of how to increase taxes to make the people bear the burden of war expenses. But increasing taxes requires a sound tax system, and thus, the most flexible and universal income tax was gradually discovered. Only income tax can meet the needs of war by raising its tax rate to increase substantial revenue. Therefore, tracing the origins of income tax historically reveals that it was promoted by wartime finance; the evolution of income tax indeed corresponds to wartime finance like a drum responds to a stick. Let's briefly discuss the historical facts of income tax in England to illustrate this point:</p>
<p>England is the birthplace of income tax, so the history of income tax in England is also a typical example of income tax history. In 1798, during the Anglo-French War, England had to strive to increase tax revenue to plan for war expenses. However, the British tax system at the time centered on customs duties, excise taxes, and land taxes. Due to the impact of the war, these not only failed to increase revenue but also showed a declining trend. Raising tax rates would place an excessive burden on the general poor. Therefore, a temporary tax was specially levied on the wealthy class to obtain financial revenue. This temporary tax was called Triple Assessment at the time, which was the predecessor of today's income tax. The temporary tax was a one-time levy on the wealthy class during wartime, so it was abolished immediately after the end of the war.</p>
<p>In 1803, the Anglo-French War resumed, and the temporary income tax was adopted again. Significant reforms were made to the tax law, such as expanding the scope of taxation, reducing tax rates, and setting tax exemption points and deductions, already embodying the spirit of modern income tax. This tax law was abolished after the end of the Anglo-French War in 1815.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Indian Rebellion and the Crimean War occurred successively, and income tax continued to be implemented with the wars. Due to the annual improvements in the tax law and the cultivation of people's tax-paying habits, the revenue from income tax increased year by year, gradually occupying an important position in finance. Without income tax, the British finances could not have been sustained. Therefore, income tax transformed from a temporary tax into a permanent tax, becoming an important part of the structure of the British tax system.</p>
<p>When World War I broke out, the British income tax experienced another leap forward. Following the principle of "one-third of duties borne by taxes," income tax became the central pillar of the tax system. Just looking at the tax revenue from income tax before and after the war is enough to show its rapid development and important position.</p>
<p>Period　Income Tax Revenue　Percentage of Total Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Pre-war (1913)　£47,249,000　29%</p>
<p>Post-war (1919)　£359,095,000　45%</p>
<p>From the origin and evolution of income tax in England mentioned above, it is clear that it advanced and retreated entirely with wartime finance. The reason for this is that income tax itself possesses various conditions for wartime finance, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Income tax is levied based on each individual's ability to pay, enabling different classes with varying degrees of wealth to have their tax burden capacity set at the same level. Therefore, unless the ability to pay of each individual reaches the critical point, there is always the possibility of increasing taxes. Moreover, the taxable object of income tax has universality. Anyone with income that reaches a certain limit has the obligation to pay taxes, unlike other taxes that are levied only on specific objects, limited to a local area, and cannot be compared in terms of the amount of revenue. In wartime, funds are urgently needed, and the amounts are very large. Although public debt can sometimes be relied upon to cope with the situation, the raising of public debt depends on the people's absorption capacity and trust in the government, and ultimately, it must still be repaid through taxes. For this reason, every time a war occurs, the expenditure of huge war expenses is often dependent on income tax to be shared among the people. Therefore, the evolution of income tax is often driven by wartime finance.</p>
<p>Since World War I, social economies have reached a more highly developed stage. With the progress of economic conditions, the political landscape has formed two camps: the rise of socialism and the rise of fascism. Income tax, which was previously aimed at fiscal revenue, has been used by some countries as a tool to complete the social policies of their respective ideologies. Other countries, in addition to fiscal purposes, also use it to harmonize the distribution of wealth among various social classes to alleviate conflicts. The former includes the Soviet Union and Italy, while the latter is the consistent trend of most countries that implement income tax today. Let's briefly discuss the recent income tax systems of the Soviet Union and Italy to clarify the relationship between income tax and social policy. The relationship between income tax and social policy.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the New Economic Policy and the restoration of monetary taxes, income tax has been adopted in the Soviet Union. However, the adoption of income tax was initially not for fiscal revenue but to achieve the goal of socialism. According to the provisions of its tax law, it can be described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Strict classification of taxable classes: The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the status and tasks of various classes in society. Therefore, it divides income into six types and stipulates different tax rates based on their social status.</p>
<p>(2) Heavy taxation on private and private enterprise income and light taxation on collective and state enterprise income: The Soviet Union advocates the nationalization of industries and actively promotes non-capitalist collective enterprises and state-owned enterprises, while advocating the abolition of private individuals and private enterprises. Therefore, it levies heavy taxes on them to allow for their natural elimination.</p>
<p>(3) For agriculture, it is also divided into four classes: collective farms, non-collectivized property of collective farms, individually operated farms, and wealthy peasants. The tax rates are the lightest for collective farms, followed by non-collectivized property of collective farms, then individually operated farms, and extremely harsh progressive taxes are levied on wealthy peasants. The Soviet Union advocates collective operation of agriculture and nationalization of farmland. Privately owned land operated independently is not allowed to exist, so heavy taxation on wealthy peasants is also intended to allow for their natural elimination.</p>
<p>(4) Widespread adoption of progressive tax rates: High progressive taxes are adopted for private income to limit the activities of private capital.</p>
<p>The social policy of the Soviet Union originally aimed at nationalizing all means of production as its highest goal. Therefore, its income tax system serves as a tool to restrict the activities of private capital and privately owned land, thereby achieving the goal of all private systems being naturally eliminated. Standing on the other side of socialist countries is fascist Italy. The social policy of Italy takes the protection of private capital as its principle, which is the so-called "principle of productivism." Therefore, its income tax system is also in the opposite position to that of the Soviet Union, but its role as a means of completing social policy is the same. Let's briefly discuss the relationship between the Italian income tax system and social policy for reference.</p>
<p>(1) After the establishment of the fascist government, various indirect taxes were successively increased, while in terms of income tax, the tax rates for movable property income tax, inheritance tax, and supplementary income tax were reduced. At the same time, agricultural income and labor income were also included in the scope of movable property income tax and levied. Although the agricultural income of semi-self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers is the same as the labor income of workers and other movable property income, this violates the principle of fairness. However, to achieve the goal of protecting private capital, this point is disregarded.</p>
<p>The income tax in Italy is divided into two types: movable property income tax and supplementary income tax. The tax rate for movable property income tax adopts a proportional system, and the tax rate for supplementary income tax adopts a very slight progressive system. Therefore, the burden on high-income earners is not significantly different from that of low-income earners, which is intended to favor high-income earners to promote the development of private capital.</p>
<p>(2) Levying taxes on capitalists directly reduces their capital and harms their power to operate. Therefore, Italy strives to reduce the tax rate for income tax. On the one hand, it expands the scope of taxation as much as possible, so that the general working class and low-income earners are also subject to taxation, which runs counter to the general principle of "heavy taxation on high income and light taxation on low income" in various countries. However, capitalists receive preferential treatment with light tax rates, which helps their ability to operate. The principle of productivism seeks to avoid anything that hinders the increase of private wealth.</p>
<p>The Italian income tax system has been briefly described above. Contrasting it with the income tax system of the Soviet Union is truly interesting. As the progress of world politics tends to two opposite extremes, the income tax system naturally also diverges and evolves. Considering the nature of income tax in relation to social policy, it is more suitable for socialist Soviet Union than for fascist Italy.</p>

<p>— Xie Juceng</p>
<p>The Shanghai English-language Da Mei Evening News recently commissioned its legal counsel to compare the personal income portion of China's income tax with the current tax rates in the United States and the Philippines, presenting the comparison in a chart with explanations. This is very detailed, and this article is based on the data from that newspaper. However, the original manuscript mistakenly stated that China's personal salary income starts to be taxed from 40 yuan, with the initial 30 yuan being the tax-exempt amount, which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. This is specifically corrected, along with the calculated figures. Translator's note</p>
<p>Why compare the tax rates of the United States with the tax rates in China's Provisional Income Tax Regulations? Because the income tax laws of other countries are intricate and difficult to compare. Only the United States' is relatively simple, and using it to compare with the extremely simple Chinese tax rates will avoid a mismatch. Secondly, the income tax law of the United States has been implemented for many years. There have been no major modification requests for the principles it establishes to date. Moreover, the Philippines uses American law as a blueprint and implements it in the Far East with great success. The standard of living in the Philippines is somewhat similar to that of China, so the Philippine law is used as a companion. In fact, the Philippine income tax law is no different from the United States in terms of basic principles, but the numbers are much lower than those of the United States. By comparing the tax rates of personal income tax in China, the Philippines, and the United States, we can discover many obvious differences. Now, let's briefly explain them.</p>
<p>(1) China distinguishes between personal salary income and securities deposit interest income, which does not exist in the United States and the Philippines. According to China's Provisional Regulations, personal service income is taxed starting from 30 yuan per month, gradually exceeding and progressing until 2% is levied on those earning 1,100 yuan per month. As for securities deposit interest income, regardless of the amount of income, 0.5% is levied uniformly. Now, if a person's monthly salary income is between 400 yuan and 500 yuan, the tax rate is 0.5%. For those between 500 yuan and 600 yuan, it is 0.6%. In fact, only 0.4% is levied on the initial 400 yuan, so the actual tax levied is less than 0.5% when the total income does not reach 700 yuan. However, when it exceeds 700 yuan, the tax levied is much heavier than that of securities deposit interest income. Because from 700 yuan onwards, the tax rate gradually increases. Assuming a person's monthly income reaches 1,200 yuan, the amount they are taxed is more than double that of a person who enjoys the same amount of securities deposit interest income.</p>
<p>(2) The United States' income tax system shows sympathy for those who live on salaries and wages. Not only is the tax rate very low, but those whose income just reaches the taxation standard are given a 10% discount.</p>
<p>(3) China's tax system has a rapid progression of tax rates for moderate and lower incomes, while the tax rates for those with huge monthly salaries progress more slowly. The United States and the Philippines treat everyone equally, regardless of their income level.</p>
<p>(4) China's tax system does not differentiate based on the taxpayer's family situation or the number of dependents they support. Taxpayers with family burdens must also follow the regulation of starting taxation from 30 yuan. As for the United States, the standard tax-exempt amount for monthly service income is equivalent to 302.50 yuan in Chinese currency. The tax-exempt amount for monthly non-service income is equivalent to 275 yuan in Chinese currency. If this person is married, the tax-exempt amount is increased to 755 yuan or 587.50 yuan. Once they have children, the tax-exempt amount is further increased by 110 yuan for each additional child or dependent relative. The average size of Chinese families has always been larger than the average size of American families, and in Chinese law, there are even crimes such as abandonment for failing to support helpless family members. However, the tax system has not paid attention to this point.</p>
<p>(5) China's tax system stipulates that personal monthly income is taxed starting from 30 yuan, so most shop clerks, secretaries, drivers, and machinists are included in the tax list. In the United States, the income of such people is far less than the prescribed tax-exempt amount, so they can be exempt from income tax.</p>
<p>(6) China stipulates that personal income tax must be paid monthly, twelve times a year, and the cost of collection seems to be larger than that of the United States and the Philippines, which collect once a year. The tax paid by low-level salary income taxpayers may only be enough to cover the collection costs of income tax personnel. If a person's monthly salary is 30 yuan and the tax paid is 5 cents, even if the employer withholds it on their behalf, the cost of recording and tabulating this account is probably equal to this tax amount. For those who do not have employers to withhold the tax, it is necessary to send personnel to collect it, which is too uneconomical.</p>
<p>When the United States started implementing income tax, the tax rate was lower than the one listed in the table in this article. It was gradually increased later, aiming to prevent the taxpayer's budget from being suddenly affected. However, although the US tax rate has been increased several times, it is still lower than China's initial tax rate, except for those with huge monthly salaries exceeding 15,600 yuan. Because according to the Chinese tax rate, if a person earns 1,000 yuan per month, the annual tax paid is equal to one month's salary. If they earn 1,100 yuan per month, their annual tax expenditure is simply more than one month's salary. In the United States, if this person's monthly income is less than 6,200 yuan in Chinese currency, the annual tax amount will definitely not reach one month's salary. In other words, taxpayers earning 1,000 yuan per month in China are treated the same as taxpayers earning 6,200 yuan per month in the United States. Those earning 6,200 yuan have about 500 yuan deducted each month, leaving 5,700 yuan. Although the standard of living in the United States is higher, it doesn't matter much, but for those earning 1,000 yuan, deducting 75 yuan will have some impact.</p>

<p>Note: The above tax amounts for the Philippines and the United States refer to taxpayers with a wife and one child. Adjustments are made for families with more or fewer members.</p>

<p>United States tax amount: 131.76 yuan; 131.76 yuan divided by 14,400 yuan equals 9.2% (United States tax rate)</p>
<p>Philippines tax amount: 12.96 yuan; 12.96 yuan divided by 14,400 yuan equals 7% (Philippines tax rate)</p>

<p>Last week, from November 16th to 21st, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, market fluctuations were entirely dictated by the waxing and waning of the Suiyuan War. Various groups had been overly bullish, resulting in overcrowded positions. Consequently, encountering the Suiyuan War led to a flurry of selling, causing prices to fall. However, with the Suiyuan War intensifying, the bond market's volatility is just beginning. Last week's events: On Monday, the Suiyuan War was poised to expand, worsening the situation, and bullish investors began to sell, with small declines ranging from 6 to 6.25%. On Tuesday, the front-line situation became increasingly tense, and selling surged, with further small declines ranging from 6.25 to 6.75%. On Wednesday, President Chiang's visit to Taiyuan heightened the atmosphere, and the war intensified, causing another decline of 0.25 to 6.75%. On Thursday, news of a victory at the front lines boosted morale, and President Chiang returned to Luoyang. Market prices suddenly turned upward, trending higher throughout the day, with a sudden increase of 0.3125 to 6.8125%.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with gains ranging from 0.0625 pound to a decline of 0.25 pound for various months. December futures saw some liquidation and swaps, with few sellers. Traders and shorts bought in, and all short-selling positions were absorbed. Although the ginning volume was high, the market trend remained firm. Spot prices were able to maintain. Within the week, cloth sales exceeded half of the production volume. Before the close, it was reported that Italy had removed restrictions on foreign exchange, causing market prices to rise. Spot prices rose by 0.25 pound, and futures rose by 0.25 to 1.1875 pound. British cotton spot prices fell by 0.01875 pound, and futures rose by 0.0625 pound. Indian cotton rose due to high purchase orders for Oomra cotton and reports of heavy rains in central regions. However, it slightly retreated due to long liquidation. Dhollerah rose by 1.75 to 2.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 0.5 rupee. Original telegram on the left (dated November 21st):</p>
