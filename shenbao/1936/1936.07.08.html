<p>時評</p>
<h3>合作事業推進之展望</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>合作事業年來經宣傳提倡之力頗有突飛猛晋之象向以江蘇·河北·山東·浙江·等省為最發達近如安徽·江西·湖北·湖南·河南·諸省亦急起直追少者有千餘社至在各大市自以上海為冠的有百餘社言其總數據聞二十四年底全國已有二萬六千餘社然衡以區域之廣袤則此二萬數千社固未足以云衆况乎其中之能循名覈實與夫具有成效者有幾猶難言之合作事業應需更大之努力焉明甚</p>
<p>合作事業之理論人人已知其重要所不足者合作事業尙未能推行盡利耳推原其故以民智之難齊可與樂成不可與圖始一也以組織之不易有此需要而無此素養二也以事業之匪細作始焉簡而將畢焉鉅三也故卽以信用合作言之其所經營之一般農村放欵亦尙未見若何實際成效關於合作事業之紙面報吿固已琳琅滿目美不勝收然就實際言之如何使民間明瞭合作社之利益尙有待於吾人之努力也</p>
<p>或以為今日之所急者為消費合作社之促進斯言誠然夫消費合作社之最感需要者非為都市生活中之中下階級乎民智較開通者又非都市中之人乎然而大都市中之享有消費合作社之利益者為數似亦有限現有之消費合作社卽號稱完善者亦尙有待於督促等而下之皆有其名而無其實或竟以營利為目的之商店耳</p>
<p>合作社之利益歸諸公而一般人之心理偏重於一己之收益合作社之畸形發展固為民情習慣使然從根本着想欲發揮合作社之眞精神尙須同時注意于民德之陶冶吾則大多數不識不知之民衆問縱有合作社之設立而操縱之者另有人在其組織猶未許以為健全也或曰似不難以强制之方式行之庶合作事業可望大有發展此共用意固無可非但如仍以合作為粉飾門面之工具卽使盛極一時實際或將更不堪問耳</p>
<p>竊以為處今日而談合作猶之課小學生然貴乎示範以身作則不令而行故為合作事業老應自身起來集合同志設立合作社所謂坐而言不如起而行使大眾知所觀感而合作乃有切實發展之希望其决就舊有事業具有合作性者因勢利導匡救其失補其不足不必合作之名但求有合作之實可矣質之時賢以為何如</p>

<h3>南巡佳話</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者石瑛</p>
<p>西湖的印象</p>
<p>杭州西湖風景的美麗，和山林泉石的幽勝，古來文人，為她不知寫作過多少詩文了。這裏的一泓水，一尊塔，一節斷橋，一叢古寺，都各別的具備着着，引人入勝，啟發幽思的風格。如此湖山景物，眞像康有為先生說的，「游徧四洲，未嘗見之</p>
<p>今次記者南巡過杭，對西湖僅作局部的訪晤，雇了一隻小划子，先和船夫商妥一日間而可遊到的地方，會到三潭印月，花港觀魚，凈慈寺，岳王廟，靈隱寺，蘇堤，湖心亭，孤山，林處士墓，放鶴亭，秋瑾墓，及各私人名莊等十餘處，他如什麼飛來峯，五雲山，龍井山，九溪十八澗，等等勝蹟，眞是指不勝屈，就是遊上十天半月，也未必一覽無餘，所以不曾登遊。實際上訪奇勝，遊山水，果爾處處走到，眼福固是不淺，但心境反易有索然之感。此遊不及去的名勝雖很多，而在悠然神往，由心造象的意境中，却覺餘興泱然，并不足為惜也。</p>
<p>在所遊各勝蹟中，有幾處予人印象很深，是値得特別提出來一述的。</p>
<p>走盡「間株楊柳間株桃」的蘇堤的北端，卽棲霞嶺下的岳湖北岸，一股忠義豪俠之氣，為湖山生色不少的岳王廟，便在眼前。廟貌的莊嚴宏麗，冠於湖上各祠宇，正殿祀岳飛塑像，謐一宋少保岳忠武王」，後殿供岳王的父母，旁配岳王夫婦與女銀缾及壻張憲，而　并供有五子五媳。岳王墓在大殿的西側，岳雲附葬其旁，這裏無有孔林那樣十分茂密的古柏，也不有中山墓宮宇式建築的墓堂，但肅然令人起敬之心，却都似乎是一樣的</p>
<p>墓木中，有檜樹曾為雷火所劈，另有亭保存「精忠柏化石」數段，扣之作金石聲，傳前者是漢奸秦檜分屍之象，後者是岳王忠義之氣所鍾而致。明時有人添籌秦檜，王氏，萬俟高，張俊，四人的銅像，五花大綁，跪於墓台數十步外，今復易為鐵像，因遊人不斷的唾罵他，或用石子投擊他，警察出示禁止，可是仍難收效。那幾個鐵像的愁慘澳喪的尊容，看着似乎有些可笑而又可憐，但轉念間，想起當時秦檜夫婦，坐在湖船上，與賣臘丸的奸細哈米施，訂合私通金人的賣國大計的往事，連自己也恨不能想打他幾石頭，雖然明知這是無意識的舉動。</p>
<p>岳武穆的家鄉湯陰縣，還盛傳着一個可靠的故事。遜淸來年，有個新縣令赴湯陰上任，途中添雇一騾夫，搬運行李，時値冬季，夜長畫短，行未抵城，便天黑宿店。縣令的親隨人，燈下沽酒，招騾夫共飮，閒談中騾夫詢及「縣令貴姓」，親隨人告以「姓秦」。那騾夫突然脹紅了臉。急又問曰，「就是秦檜的秦麼？一親隨人答，「不錯！」騾夫就推開桌椅，頓足拍案的罵道，「今天替奸臣後裔做當差，我姓岳的眞瞎了眼！」說罷，轉身牽起騾子就走。親隨追不及，直告縣令，縣令初聞之還怒，略思後却暗自驚歎不已。</p>
<p>這樣看來，凡出賣民族利益，不惜當明的或暗的漢奸者，不僅是給自身造就鐵像資格，而且還替百世子孫臉上抹灰。當代漢奸殷汝耕·溥儀·鄭孝胥之流，以及「準漢奸　蕭××等，淸夜自思，還會急愧出汗來，那麼茫茫苦海，請卽趕快回頭。以免將來增鑄鐵像，再玷辱了西湖白玉般的顏色。</p>
<p>西湖天然風景，本是明媚可愛，兼得隱士文人的歌韻，俠骨忠魂的點染，於是更收到相得益彰的美名了。但世人對於這西湖靈魂上的點綴物，卽古墓·名祠·銅像·等追慕崇拜的心理，是大略孕涵着進步的時代性的，例如宋來元初，異挨勢力伸展，民生塗炭，熱衷富貴虛榮的士人，還要靦顏向荒淫的上司討官做，所以便覺妻梅子鶴的林和靖，淸高可佩。同時宋代帝室衰微，遼金屢决大舉侵略，明末也同樣受滿淸的威脅，而都缺乏大有為的將領去抵禦，如岳家軍諸將及袁崇煥等，還先後被奸人構陷，以至壯志未成身先死，所以更覺得為忠勇衛國而犧牲的岳武穆，確是衰世的標準模範軍人，不期然而然地向他深致敬佩之意。到了遜淸末葉的近代，各地革命起事，以至北伐成功，一般崇拜先烈的眼光，便轉移注視於徐錫麟。秋瑾的俠骨英魂，以及陳英士銅像，北伐陣亡將士紀念塔諸建築物上。而今東北淪一，華北局勢日非，遊人觸景生情，悠然遐思，有的仍不免追念岳武穆的武功，以寄託「還我河山」的想像，甚或推演武穆所說「文官不愛錢，武將不怕死」的至言，認為為適應時代背景的需要，「不愛錢」「不怕死」的精神，不論文武官員，都應常兼而有之。有的理想比較前進些，假設以後還作興道一套類似的紀念建築物，不應該再重見北伐或南征的紀念塔，而是中華民族解放及世界被壓迫民挨解放之偉大的勝利己念標。</p>
<p>湖濱有某粵人營造的私莊，樓閣亭榭的宏麗，內部陳列品的名貴，大概都可以驕視其他各私莊。這裹有家祠，額曰湖山供養一，可謂堂皇之至。祠外別闢一境，為莊主和他的九位夫人的墓地，據說莊主在淸季會做過杭州的府台，死去才兩三年，夫人羣中還有未死的僅虛立着生壙，另外還有三個很年靑的（共十二位），一個忌諱不要生壙，兩個却早已「桃之夭夭」了。那墓地的祭台，池塘·花木的漂亮，就是岳王墓也還望塵莫及。這話并不是菲薄岳王墓，而是欽佩這位莊主做府台時的劃草腕力，大概是不弱於當今做官人所謂的「門檻經」啊！</p>
<p>中國歷史上的政治重心，大多是落在北方，以便外而控制滿蒙，內而統治江南。但以江南地物豐美，却又握住經濟的生命綫。自隋唐以後，江浙經濟優勢，便逐漸抬頭，形成中國經濟的重鎮，而蘇州杭州的山水，旣具先天的優美性，復得後天的優越經濟背景，加以點綴潤色，便相沿成為高等享樂的勝景區，允其杭州向稱佛地，遍山叢林寺宇，吸引力更加廣泛，聲譽更特別的大。可是遊人旣多樂誦「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」的美句，但也莫忘「老勿走新疆，少勿逛蘇杭」的警語。試看東漢直到明淸的政治勢方，一到江南，還有不被腐化下去的麼？淸代英主乾隆的南下，居然流連忘返，隋煬帝造龍舟，遊揚州，直至斷送了江山，允其宋代的南渡，奠都杭州，在那一百五十六年的偏安時期，他們君臣，還天天驚着龍船，徜徉湖上，呌宮姬們酣歌恒舞，縱情逸樂。當時憂時派文及翁「回首洛陽花世界，烟渺黍離之地，更不復新亭墮淚。簇樂紅妝搖畫艇，問中流擊楫何人是？千古恨，幾時洗？」的詩詞，竟無人理會，而柳永「三秋桂子，十里荷香的頌美句，却引起金酋完顏亮「提兵百萬西湖上，立馬吳山第一峯」的野心。</p>
<p>不過話又說回來了，靡麗棉軟的西子神，固易使人麻醉，隳志喪氣，但人能深楊於國難的嚴重，而不為外誘所沉湎，湖山自有湖山的本色，豈有替人負亡國資任之理？再看臥薪嘗胆的越王勾踐，不是也從風物秀美的浙境發祥，而興國復仇麼？</p>

<h3>日商收買雜糧</h3>
<p>小麥菜籽米糧等已裝運出口　因為數尙少民食不致受影饗</p>
<p>關於日商收買我國雜糧事宜、新聲社記者、昨日特往訪雜糧業領袖顧馨一氏、蒙告詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>收買雜糧</p>
<p>日商在蕪湖收買菜籽、運往日本榨油、此係普通事件、因日本缺乏菜籽、每年向我國採辦、至於收買小麥、計在蕪湖買進的二萬餘擔、在上海交易所絡續買進七萬餘擔、總的十萬擔、同時在內地收買米糧的一萬包、均已先後裝運出口、聞米係運往大連者、</p>
<p>為數不多</p>
<p>日商採辦小麥、向在國外訂購、今年因洋麥定價、反較我國小麥為高、因此改變方針、向我國收買、關於收買小麥和米糧、裝運出口、因為數尙少、不致使我國糧食感受影響、如日商鉅量收買、則際此我國米糧靑黃不接之時、勢必因此威受缺乏恐慌、同時使米糧等價格抬高、我國人民生計、亦將受影響云云</p>

<p>主文　譚焯宏共同連續對於公務員違背職務之行為、要求賄、處有期徒刑八年、褫奪公權十年、楊紹彭共同連續對於務員違背職務之行為、要求賄賂、處有期徒刑六年、褫奪公權八年、兩被吿聆判後、表示不服、準備提起上訴、該案判詞、茲已送達、覓錄如次、</p>
<p>事實　譚焯宏在上海在方法院充任推事、楊紹彭在上海執行律師職務、互相勾串、向當事人要求賄賂、譚焯宏於二十四年十月七日、受理章啟東自訴宋大澂誹謗、六月十三日、承辦海州輪船公司主秦　如過失致人死、九月九日、受理雷允上吿訴王炳南僞造商標、十月五日、承辦吳佩珍自訴李克庭妨害婚姻、六月二十八日、受理程李恬志吿訴益僞造文書各案、惟秦　如案、由襲漢初者轉托志大輪船茶房祁友根為其說合、其餘均由楊紹彭先後向當事人接洽、而其對於承辦吳佩珍自訴妨害婚姻案、原係配偶、不得自訴、乃竟受理、且於索賄前、將被吿李克庭覇押、而其對於秦　過失致人死案、於未判决前、竟將罪刑洩漏、對王炳南僞造商標案、因索賄賂、竟將辦案情形、盡行洩露、嗣經人向司法行政部吿發、由部密令江蘇高等法院第二分院首檢察官、及上海地方法院首席檢察官查復後、將譚焯宏楊紹彭等、連同全案卷宗、發交本院檢察官查起訴、</p>
<p>理由　被吿譚焯宏楊紹彭、對於本件罪名、是否成立、應以有無罪是行為斷、訊據譚焯宏楊紹彭、雖均否認有共同要求賄賂情事、但該被吿等具有犯罪行為、於下列各點認定之、</p>

<p>本案定今日下午續審∣</p>
<p>被公共租界工部局捕房控訴於去年十－月九日在竇樂安路槍殺日水兵中山秀雄之粵人楊文道．葉海坐。周社榮。業經第一特區法院特組合議庭、數度公開提訊、而法院因對於抄獲藏槍之物理事書籍及檢獲之手槍子彈等、有送交真茹法發研究所鑑定之必要、遂宣告延期審理各情、已屢誌本報、茲法醫研究所已遵法院之囑託、將案之手槍及子彈以友陽文道以指印及藏　書籍、就法院所詢者、一一予以研究、已告結束、就每一種之　定、製報告－份、共計鑑定書、達四本之多、內中詳述根據學理等研突所得之結果、此項鑑定書、業經送呈特一法院、是以法院已定於今日下午二時、再度開庭續訊、其審判仍採合議制、而代表捕房起訴之律師汝葆彝、前因患病、故由厲志山律師代理、茲已痊愈、今日當由汝律師出庭、至韓人傑克及日籍華人醫師鄭惠民、特院會諭知捕房傳案訊問、刀均因種種關係、始終未曾到庭、現工部局正與日領事署接恰、希望該二證人於今日能到案作證、是否得能到庭、現尚不可知、今只如時間許可、或須開始辯論、但亦須視審理之程度如何、方能斷定、現尚難預卜、今將特一院請法醫研究所鑑定各點、及該所鑑定之結果、摘錄於下、至關於鑑定書內種種學理上之探討、因全文達四大冊、不下數萬餘言、故從略、</p>
<p>射擊距離</p>
<p>（一）特院請查葉海生出事地點表演開槍情形時所指開槍之處係在被害人日本水兵中山秀雄之後、約距五六常步遠、關於該被台所稱之距離與被害人受傷情形、是否相符、檢同被害人受傷照片兩紙、診斷書附圖一份、希即分別迅予鑑定、該所郎予以鑑定、製就鑑定報告、該報告內尚附有照片十一紙、其結論大致謂按推定射擊之距離、通常均以傷口周圍之痕跡為根條、由子彈入口及出口所成之角度推算、雖亦可推知射擊時之距離、但僅能以被擊者及射擊者之常態為標準、如頭部有俯仰或傾斜情形、則非事後所能臆定、現根據中山秀雄後頤右側然片上傷口周圍之痕跡、經上述之試驗、得證明其射擊之距離、約在五公分左右、與葉海生表演時距被害者五六步之情形、不能相合、而亦非該診斷證書上推定在五十公分左右所能搆成射入口之狀況、即按該診斷證書上所標明之角度推算、若推定加害者於五步之距離放射手槍、即距被害者約三公尺四十公分、而其內減去右臂之長度、亦尚餘二公尺七十公分左右、在二公尺七十公分地點放射、若放射者臥於地面、尚能　成該診斷證書上所標明之角度、綜合以上各點觀之、據該照片上子彈入口之情形、絕非在被害浙身後五步之距離射擊所能　成之傷口、</p>
<p>書內指紋</p>
<p>特一院檢送楊文道指印</p>
<p>單一紙、請鑑定是否與</p>
<p>書本內發現之指印相符、據該所鑑定之結論、謂按指紋之描迷、極為複雜、故可用證物上所留之指紋、以作刑事偵察之根據、前送檢之物理學書內、雖留不全之指紋數枚、但均係不全短紋、月紋路亦不清晰、在該書內之第三十七頁下方、附有淺藍色不全指紋一枚、其顏色與該書內　形挖洞之邊緣劃痛顏色相近、似雖其中央及左或右之三角紋均付缺如、所鹠者僅少數之短紋、亦就其所留有紋路在可能範圍內、詳細研究、並將送檢楊文道左右兩手各指所印指紋、與之膩相比對、因該書三十七頁下方所留之淺藍色指紋、僅係手指上一部份之矩紋、無特殊之性質、可以檢見、故不能證明與楊文道指紋中、亦有此種紋路、</p>
<p>書內挖洞</p>
<p>（三）特一院檢送二四一一四六號手槍一支、實用物理學書一本、請鑑定　以手檢藏於霄內挖洞處、須經過若干時間、始留鏽跡、　（書內　跡橫紋壓痕、是否自然遺留、抑係人工造成、　書之裝訂處（郎第十六頁右頁）劉有籃色鉛筆痕跡、是項藍色、留於紙上、已經若干時日、　霄之挖洞處、係用刀類挖成、被挖之四週、刀痕是否陳舊、抑係新跡、挖洞後巳經過若于時日、經該所鑑定書內作種種之研究、並附有照片九紙、其結論謂，　以手槍藏於書內挖洞處、須經過若干時間、始留　跡、查　鉼為錢在室氣中起氧化作用、生成氧化鐵、呈黃紅褐色、即為鐵鉼、其放置處所空氣之溫度及手槍表面有無油脂附著、均能影響其氯化發生之遲速、故僅　班、未能佔計共收錢之時日、　書內　跡及橫壓痕、是否自然遺留、抑係人工造成、在前檢查之書內橫紋壓痕、其每線距離或長短、與槍筒後方之直行隆起線、經詳細比對、均屬相符、故該手槍或同牌等大之手槍、均能留此種壓痕、但壓痕其深、並於手槍保險機對方之紙面上、　成有破孔二枚、斜行排列、在前方者為保險機關時之印痕、在後方者、為保險者開時之印痕、其邊緣翻捲有　斑及油跡、查該在前壓痕深達十頁、用紫外線光照射、呈顯著油痕螢光、應屬油跡、橫行　痕、位於上而者、自第十六頁起至第十二頁止、均甚清晰、其位於下面者、自一二八三頁起至三九九頁止、亦甚顯明、查該手槍之重量、僅六百公分、縱經長時日放置書內、亦不易成如此深痕及破孔、胡此深透壓痕、非藉外界之壓力、不易形成、例如該書上會墜有重量書籍、或其他重量物品、且書內所挖手槍形空洞、較手槍約長〇。六公分、故手槍在空洞內尚可移動、設會有搖動情形、或可搆成此種破孔、若僅恃該手槍之本身重量，似不能排成書中現存有之墜成痕跡、　書之裝訂處（即第十六頁右頁）留有藍色鉛筆痕跡、是項藍色、留於級上、己經若幹時日、查藍色書痕、係用含有臘質之藍色鉛筆所畫、此種痕跡色澤、不易變史、故對於畫後時日、經過之長短、乏妥善方伙、以解釋之、　書內之挖洞處、係用刀類挖成、被挖之四週刀痕、是否陳舊、抑係新跡、挖洞後已經若幹時日、查許本內之槍形挖痕、其四週整齊、僅於左側略為粗糙、其色澤與紙表面之色澤、無顯著之義別、在一般紙張切痕、每可因色澤濃淡、或可判斷其新舊、但本次所檢之槍形切痕、係於書中、不易與外界光線塵埃接觸、殊難測定其經過時日、</p>
<p>子彈血跡</p>
<p>（四）特一院檢送　一九號子彈一顆、請鑑定　是否會山人體中穿過、有無血跡、　子彈山人髒中穿過、是否可以不留血跡、　如有血跡、經擦淨後、能否驗出、當由該所　附照片二紙、其結論謂、　在送檢子彈上未能檢見血跡存在、該槍彈浸漬液之沉澱物內、亦未見含有人嚴組繳細胞、　子彈由人體中穿過、是否可以不切血跡？若僅穿入人體一剖而仍存留於體內、經解剖手術取出之槍彈、則該檢彈上應留有血痕、友附著之人體組織細胞、至槍彈由人體穿過而落於其他地點、其彈上是否應留有血痕、在法醫學上尚乏此稱文獻及實例、可供參考、但據學理而言、凡槍彈由人體穿過、應有附著之人體組織、惟此稱情形、是否因射擊距離遠近所不同、則極堪研究、查槍彈方出檢筒時、在其最初射程內、熱度甚高、若於該時穿透人體、則其上所附著之血痕、是否可因熱度而破壞、及槍彈在經過人體之過程內、其熱度低減若干、在不同等熱度空氣中、經過其　度低減記錄如何、在法醫學上亦乏此種論著文獻、以上關於槍彈上附著人參組織、是否得為熱度所破壞、各問題之研究、已涉及兵器學範圍、本所缺乏此項設備、未能施行試驗、僅藉射擊動物試驗結果以解釋之、現就距離約三十公分五十公分及一公尺用同種手槍及子彈向活犬之胸腹部射擊、子彈穿通體腔竄入棉花中、再將愴彈一一取出、施以各種方法血痕之詳細檢查、及組織細胞檢查，結果、均呈陰性、且槍彈所附著之棉絲上、亦無血痕、據此種試驗之結果、可知在近距離射擊中穿動物身體之槍彈、得不留有血痕、　如有血跡、若僅以紙布拭擦、則其來復線內及槍彈之後端、每存有血痕、若會經化學物品處置、則是以破壞人體蛋白或久浸於水液中、亦可使蛋自溶解脫落、有如上述之情彩、則於檢驗時無法檢見人體蛋白、以上均係根據學理事實作公允之解釋、須至說明者、查此項鑑定書、送交法院、即由法院通知三被告之辯護人等到院閱看、現已完畢、故今日開審時，對於此項鑑定、或有劇烈之辯論也、</p>

<h3>拋石灰縛雙手　刧奪閽捕手槍</h3>
<p>盜匪有計劃的行劫　五盜飛逃拘獲其四</p>
<p>昨晨二時三刻、有盜匪五名、同往新閘成都路福民邨、企圖搶劫、因該里後弄、經房東四明銀行設有司閣崗位、其時捕房所派司間捕徐州人周金生住宿於木亭內、各盜恐搜劫時、被該司閣捕發覺、必多棘手、故為先發制人起見、首卽闖入木亭、一盜袖出手槍、嚇禁周捕聲張、另一盜復用石灰向周捕頭面拋擲、冀毀其雙目、餘三盜則以</p>
<p>繩索綑綁</p>
<p>周捕兩手後、乃奪取該捕之實彈五粒手槍一桿、始一閧逃出木亭、但周捕雙目雖遭打擊、幸未失明、遂奮不顧身、追踵而出、各盜不暇往劫居戶財物、向西南方面飛奔、經過聖母院路等處、至法租界蒲石路、由法捕房一〇九號·八〇六號。兩捕協助截獲沈新華·俞章龍·兩名、並檢得</p>
<p>盜棄手槍</p>
<p>一支、帶回新閘捕房、　供同黨匿跡蒲石路一百五十五號、當由探長馮百順·探目孫文熹·探員孔廣孝·等、與西探帶同沈·俞·兩盜馳往搜捕、經過金神父路、卽截獲陳錦三（又名小四子）一名、嗣至蒲石路一五五號屋內、續獲胡元勝（又名王海山）一名、五盜卒擒其四、祇一名王三鑽子者、因未回盜窟</p>
<p>遂倖漏綱</p>
<p>周捕被搶了實彈手槍、亦從陳盜床舖下之戤士令油桶內搜出、帶歸捕房、詰問調查之下、知四盜均屬皖籍、沈盜昔年曾犯搶案、被第二特區法院判處徒刑九年、而監禁至去歲、其刑期尙餘五年有零、卽准予假釋、乃該匪怙惡不悛、茲又糾合黨徒、實施不法、奪械之際、沈盜執手槍</p>
<p>嚇禁周捕</p>

<h3>上海之錫塊業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之三十一）</p>
<p>一，概述</p>
<p>本埠錫槐業之營業性質，卽為敗運及融化錫塊，售與一般錫箔莊及錫器號，惟今昔稍有不同。在五六年前，因外錫進口，納稅甚輕，本埠之錫號以販銷新嘉坡及南洋羣島一帶之錫槐（通稱荷蘭錫）為主。嗣後因外錫進口稅率加重，輸入已無厚利可圖，於是雲南湖南一帶之國產土錫遂得起而代之；惟該項土錫皆為未經融化者，故本埠錫號之主要業務，徐原有之販運外，又需兼及土鍚之融化矣</p>
<p>本埠錫號所販售之錫塊，十分之七八用於製造錫箔，其餘則用於製造器皿及焊錫。錫箔薄如紙，因而所需錫塊之質地非極純良不可，製造器皿者可稍次一級（含純鍚十分之六卽可），至焊錫則更可上下不拘矣。舶來之荷蘭錫，成色甚佳，含純錫百分之九十九，故專用以製造錫箔，惟目下幾全以土錫代替。按土錫因融化成色不同，名稱亦異，用途亦殊，今列記如後：</p>
<p>福足，為錫槐中之最佳者，其成色的在九九·七八之間，現因售價過高，已不多見。</p>
<p>小烘，又名瓜烘錫，為市上最普通之錫塊，其成色的九九·三四，每塊的合司馬秤七十五斤。</p>
<p>通光，此項鍚槐，成色更低，純錫僅含十之五六，其餘為鋁及雜質，係用舊錫器及錫箔灰烊製而成。</p>
<p>鈎光，其成色又略較逼光為劣，惟仍用以製造錫器。</p>
<p>焊錫，成色不一，但亦最劣。</p>
<p>此外，市上所售之錫，亦有按其來源不同而異其名稱者，今舉共主要者於後：</p>
<p>箇舊鍚，以產於雲南之箇舊縣而得名。在國產中產量最多，惟箇舊鍚本身質地至不一律，普通成色最高者為九九·九，最低者為八四·五，每槐的合司馬秤五十餘斤。</p>
<p>衡錫，普通稱衡點，為湖南衡州所產，其成色的自九九·三至九九·六不等，每塊作長方形，的合司馬秤五十餘斤。</p>
<p>江華錫，為湖南江華所產，成色頗佳，為九九·九，亦為長方形，每槐的合司馬秤二十二三斤。</p>
<p>臨武錫，為湖南臨武所產，或色與江華錫相同，每塊的重司馬秤五十餘斤。</p>
<p>贛州錫，為江西臨武所產，成色的九九左右。礦錫澆時，卽置於鑊內，故成鑊形，每塊的合司馬秤五十餘斤。（未完）</p>

<h3>暑期學生國貨運動</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近國貨界與敎育界，携手合作，舉辦此至有價値之事業，莫如利用學生暑假從事國貨運動，努力於提倡國貨之推行，以挽救此空前之經濟國難。前日招待各學校校長席上，愈認為此根本之救國工作，一致願盡力量，切實進行。上中校長鄭通和君，中華職業學校校長賈佛如君，光華大學秘書朱有瓛君，均謂提倡國貨，為國民應盡之天職，吾等回校後，立刻指導學生工作，並將辦法通函回籍學生照辦，開學後並當開一學生國貨運動成績展覽會，陳列各同學假內之活動情形。鄭君並貢獻二點：　凡居領袖地位者，必先以身作則，服用國貨，推及親友，收效必宏。　提倡國貨最好在內地多多致力。俾內地民衆，有認識國貨之能力。黃任之先生謂：「提倡國貨，非國貨廠家謀自身之發展，實為整個的國貨業與整個之國家着想。最近走私問題日趨嚴重，一般國貨界有全部崩潰之勢，其結果實不忍言。在此非常時期，社會各界，皆須紛起提倡國貨，爭此最後一着。余前此固獻身於敎育界，現願奮其餘力，為國貨界服務」云云。此老當益壯之黃先生，熱忱漬湧，在座均為動容。而敎育界領袖鄭賈諸氏之身體力行，為學生倡，允為難得。此暑期學生之國貨運動，實與蔣院長主張學生服務社會之旨趣相合。希望我學生界利用本年暑假，為此救國家救社會之國貨運動。由調查，而勸導，而演講，而組織，而展覽，而研究，而報告，各本血忱，為國努力。果能舉國學生界全體動員，為此國貨運動之救國工作，其影饗之大，效力之宏，寧可勝計？吾知有熱忱奮發之校長，必有此熱忱奮發之學生。以不厭不倦之精神，為再接再厲之工作，燃犀燭照，撲减走私，我國貨界不絕之運命，或有轉機之希望。敬於盛會之餘，一掬贊佩之誠，祝頌本年學生國貨運動之成功。</p>
<h3>國貨運動需要三助力</h3>
<p>— 寸</p>
<p>國貨運動　在表面上看來，似乎已經到了相當成功的時期，大工廠和大規模的國貨公司都紛紛興起，但是我們考察其實際，還覺得在萌芽時期，像各種重要機械，大都要靠外國供給，有些原料，（像最細的細紗人造絲等），多是購自外洋的，工商業的管理制度，也都是勉强效法外國的皮毛，能否適合我們的國貨運動的環境與需要，還是一個値得討論的問題。</p>
<p>國貨運動應當　實事求是，適合民族的需要，不可專事洋化，因為這樣也許會阻礙國貨運動的前進；然則甚麼是國貨運動的助力呢。</p>
<p>科學的助力　二十世紀是科學的時代，沒有科學的國家，必要漸漸衰滅，以致民族淪亡，試看我們中國，科學等於零，大規模的事業像電氣工程化學工程製造機械等，沒有一樣不要仰給於外國，所以國貨運動首先要培養偉大的科學家發明並創造一切機械，化學等大工程，這樣，國貨運動纔能成功，中華民國纔有這國貨年的國家。</p>
<p>政府的助九　政府的助力，除培養及勉勵科學家外，還要帮助及建設大工業，應當把全國通盤計劃，怎樣抵制外貨，怎樣使國貨運動成功，造成一個完全國貨的國家，怎樣能够把國貨推銷到國外去，……這都是政府的責任。</p>
<p>民衆的助力　如今我們已被帝國主義壓迫得透不過氣來了，而一部份民衆們依舊把洋貨推銷，而置國貨於不顧，這是自取滅亡的途徑，所以民衆應當覺悟起來，個個不買洋貨，完全服用國貨，使中國人製造的國貨，中國人自己來享用。</p>
<p>以上三者是聯帶關係的，不能分開單獨進行，要三者同時合一的向前進展。</p>
<h3>國貨推銷員</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>我們時常聽見一般人稱呼一般歡迎『洋貨』的『洋迷』，為『洋貨推銷員』。顧名思義，自然是說他或她，對於日常一切的吃的；着的；用的：都要採購『洋貨』，無異是帮『洋貨』誧子推銷生意！這是何等可恥？何等失面子的事情？</p>
<p>要知道，好好的一個中國人，自家旣有了很好的『國貨』，便該用自家的『國貨』。自家旣有了很好的『國貨』不用，而定要用『洋貨』，這便是『自暴自棄』！自暴自棄，為人類所不齒，就是將貨售給你，賺了你的錢去的外國人，也難免不暗暗要譏笑你『不愛國』。你想，這豈非失面子，豈非最可恥的事情喲？</p>
<p>唉！朋友！現在我們閒話少說。總而言之，希望你自己要省察一下，憑良心問問自己，是不是一個『洋貨推銷員』？如果不是的，那當然値得我們敬佩的，同時還要希望你加勉。如果，是的話，那我們要掏誠勸你，趕快覺悟，從今以後，對於日常的一切用品，以及關乎吃的；着的；都要採購『國貨』。換句話說，便是要勸你做一個『國貨推銷員』。那纔是光榮！那纔有面子！</p>
<h3>插烟莖抗螟</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>我中華號稱以農立國，自以米糧為主要產品，列作輸出物類之一。但近年以來，事實昭示，適得其反，雖因地方不靖，旱潦相繼所致，然遭受螟害，亦一原因。據專家估計，我國稻作所受螟蟲之損失，年達數萬萬元之巨。良以洪水汜濫，其害不及高原，天時亢旱，其害不及低窪。惟螟患之烈，農田不論高下，胥有蔓延之可能。</p>
<p>「插烟莖抗螟，」經浙省昆蟲局歷决試騐，頗具實效。同時目能促進田稻發藥，增加產量，其揰用力法，卽於稻秧移植四星期左右，將烟莖揰於稻枝之旁，每叢一支，如能在稻未抽穗之前，換插二三决者尤佳。此法價廉效偉，輕而易舉。今者下秧之期已屆，各地蟲區農民不妨一試，以觀後效。况晚近我國各省均有烟葉出產，烟莖旣能防治螟虫，則將來如能全國普遍插用，亦廢物利用維護農村經濟之一得也</p>

<p>按棉蘭足球、惠堂於民十九初蒞斯土時、觀察所得、其程度本甚平庸、球員且多不黯用頭者、其幼稚處、實與當時西貢諸隊不相伯仲、爾時每遇比賽、事前均知必勝、咸無戒心、殊不料六年來、因與外來球隊接觸觀摩、球藝突飛猛晋、一日千里、所謂士別三日、又常刮目相看、其程度提高不少、使外隊不敢輕視、中尤以馬來球員之進步、為最顯著、去年南華、以不整之軍、遭其迎頭痛擊、戰訊傳歸、初余尤不敢置信、今日身歷目觀、始知確屬不凡、其戰勝南華、實非俸致、反觀我國故步自封、年來進步遲緩、或竟毫無進展、六年前吾人認為不堪一擊的棉蘭球隊、今日已追踪而至、趕上來且有搶過頭的趨勢、我想長此以往、則人進一步、我退一尺、將來我國足球也非樂觀、多請外間強隊來華週旋、是最有裨益的辦法、希望當局能担起艱鉅、實現這希望和工作、</p>
<p>檳榔嶼</p>
<p>吾隊蕩平棉蘭各隊後、六月十七日下午五時便買舟離棉、向樓檳　嶼進發、檳島為馬來亞北部一個小島、面積和香港差不多、與棉蘭遙遙對峙、隔一衣帶水、十四小時的航路并不覺苦、十八日淸晨便抵埠了、來數迎的有黃領事僑團代表報界記者多人、把碼頭塞擠到毫無隙地、走車至上海旅店安息、午飱後卽分乘汽車多輛、逕赴離檳島五十里之『吉礁』小埠、準備下午與該埠選隊比賽、抵該埠後、卽承各團體紛紛開會歡迎、儀式與他地如出一轍、分由容主任及記者答謝感意、五時左列球友、卽戎衣與選隊相見、</p>
<p>包家平　蔡文禮　麥紹漢　梁樹棠　梁榮照　張顯源　鄭季良　譚江柏　孫錦順　黃美順　楊水益</p>
<p>上半時五比零、結果八比一、立功者江柏匹、水益二、美順錦順名一、代隊長包家平、吉礁埠小人稀、年前南華會一度來此、今日雖熱鬧空前、然全塲觀衆、不滿三千、此間足球程度、亦較幼稚、我方應戰陣容不甚强勁、但已綽有餘裕、全塲比賽盡成吾隊天下、戰情亦毫不緊張、江柏頭頂脚踢、獨奏四功、最為觀衆所讚美、其他無足記述、晚承設筵欵待、飯畢驅車駛返檳城、抵寓時已鐘打十一下了、</p>
<p>（六月十九日）今日吾隊定與檳城聯隊作戰、上午承全島僑團開歡迎大會、舉行授旗大禮、會中由黃領事及僑商學各界相繼致詞、容主任及余先後被央演講、拍照茶會畢始散歸、下午五時開火、我隊以左方陣容出戰、結果零比零和局、</p>
<p>包家平　譚江柏　李天生　陳鎭和　徐亞輝　梁榮照　鄭季良　卓石金　李惠堂　孫錦順　曹桂成</p>
<p>檳島足球實力、在馬來亞佔有相當地位、惟當地人士、鑒於吾隊在星洲作戰佳續、咸認樓島非我敵手、且有以為我隊之勝必在四球以上者以為博、又孰知天下事每有出人意料外、鏖戰結果、雙方各無所獲、和局而終、查彼隊能不失敗、半為守衛得力、半憑幸運相助、吾人射門多决、多中門柱或橫木彈回、終未能破關以入、敵方防衛、森嚴得法、後中衛死守家園、老不肯過中綫一步、加以吾人前綫表演平庸、雖屢取攻勢、亦未克奏功、下半時我方且數瀕於危、幸守者尙佳、不致疏失、我隊自馮葉二鋒在棉受傷後、錦順過胖、石金體弱、顯源非前鋒材、吾人前梭益感村乏之歎、苟馮葉不早告痊、則未來勁敵正多、殊足為吾人進攻力憂慮、賽畢由本雄足球總會茶點歡迎、容主任英語答謝、返寓後拾疊行裝、準備明早赴仰光云、</p>

<h3>證券債市靜觀時局轉移</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所市況、因時局沉悶、放空稀少、且以隔日已經跌落、散戶稍有補空、市價稍稍回堅、籌碼上暫時尙屬均衡、川帮以領用法幣關係、稍有吸收、一方現貨流出、亦有相當數量、前途仍擊於二中全會、其關係頗為重要、昨日經過、開盤卽以四號五號三十三號等先後賣出而小、惟以二十一·三十四及三十五號等買進、市况疲中帶堅、决盤三十四·三十五及四十八等均有買進、賣氣稍懈、趨勢轉堅、大都回好一二角左右、午後開盤、十一號需要較前為湧、市價再行軋上一二角、收盤四號又有吸收、交易雖淸、但又為之提高一角左右至二角、日來趨勢、大體不脫盤旋、雙方目光、均靜觀時局、昨日市價結果、大都回上五分一角至半元、成交總數、共計四百二十二萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　獲利多頭吐出　紗市反動下瀉</h3>
<p>紗市晨漲午跌、局勢益覺紊亂、人氣尙堅、市塲投機商異常在熱、因之波浪甚大、實緣期紗連朝飛漲、客方現銷仍無大量發展、未免美中不足也、午後據云證券商獲利吐出、英廠開出棉紗三千包、於此反動下瀉矣、</p>
<p>標紗午後步步下游</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因華棉續漲、市塲人心平靜、各月參差不齊、上下二·三·角、二盤續疲、詎料三收盤、通記及多頭又來吸收、目傳粉麵市塲仍未開拍、空氣突然緊張、買風頓起、各月均跳上一元四·五·角、給果各月比上日收盤價均漲三·七·八·九角至一元一角、午後開盤、氣勢漸漸軟化、且賣者缺乏、各月均跌六·七·八角、但以後步步傾向下游、蓋以證券帮多頭出籠、檯面趨鬆、惟豐泰晨出午進、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一元四·六·八·角、查賣出信誠一千〇五十包、同和二千包、明德一千〇五十包、澄記一千七百五十包、振大一千二百五十包、合興四千六曰包、泰昌二千四百五十包、益昶二千二百五十包、潤康一千六百包、大昶二千六百包、元一一千一百五十包、大昌成一千包、長豐二千八日包、永昌九百五十包、買進仁豐一千三百包、大孚三千八百五十包、通記二千二百包、裕大二千五百五十包、達記一千五百五十包、森康二干八百五十包、長豐一千七百五十包、新華九百五十包、生源八百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>怡和廠開出三千包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尙佳、查全日各帮成交統計九百五十包、售價漲跌二角半、各帮買額如下、布傳怡和廠開出二十支五福牧羊三千包、價二百十元、扣全佣、八·九·十月出淸、</p>
<h3>同業傾向拋空　棉花欲漲反跌</h3>
<p>棉市始堅續跌、市勢極形紊亂、蓋以多空兩方意志不一、惟金業一味拖進看好、然同業因新花目前情形尙稱不惡、傾向拋空、聞後聞新花拋盤做開、多頭了結而轉下挫矣、</p>
<p>證券商多頭已出檔</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以連漲數日、一般力量淺薄者、早已斬結淸楚、故美棉來電雖好十一磅音、印棉漲〇·五至一羅比、市塲人心平定、陳棉微漲五分至一角、新棉跌一·二·角、二盤平平、三盤忽然狂跳、市傳粉麥看好、交易所停板、於是買風驟熾、各月飛躍三·四角、收盤稍平、結果陳花漲一角半至三角半、新棉勿動、午後開盤市况轉趨沉寂、因證券商之多額出檔、且有新花拋盤售開、人心壓平、市盤步開步落、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二角至四·五·角半、查賣出源興昌六千担、新昶二千二百担、生源一千八百担、益昶一千二百担、仁豐四千四百担、恒德一千八百担、長餘一千六百担、大豐二千三百担、裕大一千四百担、大孚五千四百祖、明德二千四百担、合興五千担、大昶一千八百祖、買進通記一萬一千七百担、聚興六千八百担、泰昌二千一百担、錦昌二千四百担、明德二千九百担、元一三千担、長豐三千三百担、同和五千八百担、信誠四千三百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>新棉拋盤業已做開</p>
<p>現棉消費平庸、惟新棉業巳拋盤售開、日商吸進來源姚花二百二十包云、</p>
<h3>美棉旱區得雨行市仍漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况活動、各月漲六至九磅音、利物浦消息良好、同業·經紀商·及外商一致買進、紡織品市况活動、現貨緊俏、棉田估計平和、麥市有力、均為市價上升之原素、據估囤棉處在一角一分八釐時、售出十月期二萬包、鐵克塞斯消息、雨水有益、棉收良好、但同業不加注意、收盤堅穩、計現貨漲十三磅音、期貨漲十一至十五磅音、英棉現貨不動、期貨漲跌一至三點、印棉多頭了結、為日商所吸收、計平果爾漲跌〇·二五至一羅比、奧姆辣漲一·二五至一·五羅比、白羅溪漲半羅比、原電錄左、（六日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、七日四五月期白羅溪花開盤預測、為二百十六羅比半、較上日收盤漲半羅比、</p>
<p>上週蘭貢輸出棉花量</p>
<p>六日孟買電、上週目蘭貢方面輸出之棉花數量、共十八頓、均至利物浦、</p>
<p>三品紗平花堅</p>
<p>七日大阪電、三品期紗漲跌一角至九角、近月為二百零五元六角、遠月為二百零一元一角、期棉漲一角五分至四角、近月為六十八元、遠月為六十三元四角五分、</p>
<p>美棉私家估計（單位千數）</p>
<h3>糧食　錫地到源日旺　期麥午後突降</h3>
<p>多頭大批脫手</p>
<p>本月跌二角一</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈近平遠漲之象、以目下形勢、雖洋麥報價、仍高漲一元五六角之巨、但國內正値新麥上塲、年景又較往年為豐、人心發皇、大部分均為投機所造成、一待事過境遷、易生反動、七八月份、因廠方不動、且傳現麥去胃轉呆、人心已軟、較前日小三四五分不等、九月份以下、初亦平靜、後因業外又有吸進、市面又抬、九十月份竟提七八分、十一一二月份好三五分、迨至下午開盤、市面忽急遽大變、跌度甚在、因各廠對於東車、未有只包進意、且聞無錫目前到源甚暢、每日有三五萬包之數、市面小去一角、因此人心搖動、多頭大批脫手、而近期之跌度、竟達二角一分、餘則均達一角左右、此種情形、實非偶然、因現化不佳、自不得不降跌也、至全市現麥、祗開出船麥一千餘包、自四元二角、次至四元零四分、觀察後步、恐尙有續落之勢云、</p>
<p>美國小麥市况、因套賣奇踴之可能性、西南之大批收獲、可見供給之增多、與買方籌碼過大之恐慌等、皆為作物損害報告、天氣酷熱、與恐加麥旱災無甚改善所抵消、美麥可見供給估計增加二、七二八、〇〇〇斛、加麥可見供給估計减少二、三七九、〇〇〇斛、玉蜀黍可見供給估計增加二四八、〇〇〇斛、</p>
<h3>粉交因整理塲賬　昨未開拍</h3>
<p>麵粉交易所、因前日交易奇暢、總數達三百五六十萬包之巨、了結旣感侷促、收納證據金、又非一時所能辦楚、是以全日結賬、及整理賣買市外之謠言、均屬無稽、因市面之上落、為交易所常見之事、不過極度之升降、未免引起業內外之注意云、</p>
<h3>新黃豆登場</h3>
<p>比去年高起二元三角半</p>
<p>新黃豆今庚上市頗早、咋日已有溫州貨首批登塲、由新瑞平掄運到二十包、貨品尙佳、惟身份因乃趕新關係、故祗有六七成乾燥、當由本街零星菜担戶分去、價開六元二角、行情比較客歲（七月十六日）第一次價「三元八角半」、見漲二元三角五分、蓋常時市面平穩、不若今年各貨坸趨尖銳耳、其除陳豆去路、榨油廠辦胃尙蟬聯、成交四平街豆四車、漯河豆二千二百包、駐馬店信陽州豆三四百包、又牛莊黑豆車、市勢穩定、暫無變化、</p>
<h3>來源過旺　客秈跌一角左右</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市以、又見趨落、因前昨兩天中到頭轉旺、天氣轉晴後、各路　數更湧、且恐天熱影響、四販坸主求晚、昨日成交雖見活潑、終以來源過旺、人心莫不趨下、而交易之見多、亦因貨主貶價所致、內地帮趁機揀辦中决低價各米二千多包、本街胃口亦香、全日成交江西米四千五百六十三包、湘米六十包、蕪米三百包、江北鎭江各米三百二十包、漢機米二百八十包、紹興糙晚五十包、行情均比前日跌小一角左右云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　滬廠經頗見興奮</h3>
<p>人造絲標出數十箱</p>
<p>昨日紐的絲市突漲、各級絲品及現期貨品之價格、均較上週六高漲五分、橫濱絲價亦隨之堅挺、現貨售開較前日漲十八元、期貨漲十三元、然至下午則回跌二十元左右、里昂絲市、頗形呆定、中日生絲持價一律不動如前、本埠絲市、已似乎叉呈興奮、除洋莊有若干售開外、用戶絲貨價甚為堅俏、人心亦多看好、故國內囤戶進　亦健、洋莊絲市、反形見拙焉、</p>
<p>人造絲市情　前由華北裝到之該處海關標出之一百二十號天檀美女牌八十六箱、今為本市四家字號合股購得、字號開價　百九十五元、成交二十箱、再由華北裝到海關標出貨一百二十號天橋牌九十箱、並已售出、字號開價四百零四五元、成交三十餘箱、</p>
<p>歐貨走銷愈弱、蓋現市上各地海關標出之日貨充斥、下星期二本埠江海關、又將招商投標、共二六、二六〇磅、</p>
<h3>新繭登場第一月　蠶絲出口報告</h3>
<p>八月一日……開始生絲品質檢騐</p>
<p>明年新繭……實施生絲品級檢騐</p>
<p>據實業部上海商品檢騐局報告、六月份蠶絲出口計白廠絲二、四五九包、共他絲經二六八包，廢絲一、二一五包、共計三、九四二包、較去年同月之四、七九八包、略形减色、惟本月為新繭登塲之起首，在此一月中、絲業者均紛紛採辦春繭、籌設廠基、頗形緊張、市塲交易、多廢拋新、現貨出口、例必較少、據最近調查、春繭登塲後、絲廠開工者、計有無鍚二十餘家、浙江各地二十五家、上海四十二家、共計八十餘家、氣象頗為蓬勃、叉本埠商品檢騐局於三月間奉令籌辦生絲品質檢騐後、月來向國內外訂購各種新式檢騐機械儀器、招收訓練技術人員、積極籌備、原定於七月一日實行、嗣因機械裝置甚費時日、業已呈准部方改於八月一日正式實行、該局並於六月二十二日召集江浙川魯絲業代表會議採取各方意見、以期集思廣益、各絲業代表在塲發表意見、均擁護政府辦理生絲品質檢騐、以挽救絲業、該會議並决定明年新繭登塲後、寳施生絲品級檢騐、在此一年價備時期中、俾政商各方研究妥善辦法、以便如期實行云、</p>

<h3>湖山深處</h3>
<p>— 湖丐</p>
<p>攬勝錢塘，而不東躋五雲，上窮天門，未可與語湖山至妙之趣。蓋六橋兩堤，僅得其淸，龍井靈隱，略佔其幽；若求雄與秀兼，邃與曠并，非升降雲烟，無從頒略。常人遊杭，大都水泛瓜皮，陸行筍輿，淺陟粗嘗，已侈意足；誰解天成妙趣，都在淡妝西子以外也？由江干發步，沿杭富路施施而行，左挹波光，右吞嵐影，風籟不動，舌鼻若與乾坤相舒翕者。時晨曦漸展，濺水茁紺紫鱗，綺麗無比；而估帆漁篷，方待潮生，恬靜亦如新蛻蛙。過九龍頭，以達梵村，一路絲柳撲襟，雙都綠眸。村舊為蓮池大師卓錫處，小市人家，淸曠有致。西行穿坂野折入峯麓，濃陰上蔽，不通陽光，料山外日影已正，而是處宿鳥方驚啼一二聲爾。更前，為雲栖竹徑，萬琅玕麼戞兩旁，錚錚作響，筠粉如雪，着履晶然。篁端多鑿字，大書某某放生，善男女用心到此，可笑也。緣左道，循崖而升，卽為五雲；初上，石級坦整步，三百餘舉，漸不支；載憇載登，俯臨無地。惟見古寺午烟，絲絲胃松項上，風捲之，往往合二三縷至數十百樓而綜其端，樹罅抽長者，仍氤氳不息，此景殆難描述。山脊有亭曰林海，可以瞰錢江，水氣薰蒸，僅露練影。再上，徑削無級，荒藤壯手足，猶虞力竭；斂息浴汗者凡半時許；始達興際寺。寺踞山顚，四曠無蔽，僅一老樹當門，自作怒濤聲。佛火幽寒，僧癯不俗，與話寺歷，淸談在六朝上。繞五雲亭，更陟荒巒，披草投足，不循樵徑；歷茶葉山，萬年背，風聲樹聲而外，亦時聞採茶少女曼歌酬唱，意在相悅，不忌桑濮，宛然太古情景。下度筤簹嶺，十里蒼翠，飛鳥在腋，念列子御風故事，忽然意會。嶺盡，上捫獅子峯，高亞五雲，而峻嶮過之，其顚一石兀立，凡骨莫上。時望天門，猶屹峙雲端，臂行以趨，風吹欲墜；下注亂峯，黃紫爭豔，緣脚底暮陽正幻作餘彩也。至胡公嶺，雲絮封岫，樵棌絕迹，空谷趕程，鳥鳴上驚；無己，求宿龍井寺，徹夜溪聲，與鐘磬相答，自疑入世已再度矣？</p>
<h3>白開水</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>衛生家是不喝茶，不喝咖啡，而只是用白開水解渴的。說的是茶與咖啡，都是刺激神經的，惟有喝着白白開水，才能引經據典的說出一篇大道理來，而博得人們的點頭喝彩，與拍手呌好。</p>
<p>白開水這東西，在喝慣茶與咖啡的人們喝起來，總覺得是淡而無味，滿沒有茶與咖啡那麼可口。可是我一位喝慣白開水的朋友說，「白開水，猶如一位沒有懂　風情的鄉下大姑娘。　然伊不懂得天下有搽黃胭脂，穿高跟鞋那麼一回事，同時，伊也不知男女之間，有「情」字與「愛」等存在着的，但是天下也惟有這種天眞而沒有虛榮心的女子，才値得愛戀的。愛戀風月塲中的女子，雖然似乎是足以使人陶醉着，但是足以使人陶醉着的女子，也有使人得到極度悲哀的可能。因為這種味子的愛情，是混雜着男種作用的，正如茶與咖啡，是茶與咖啡的滋味，不是本質的原來的滋味。要求得原來的滋別，惟有於白開水中，去體味出來。」</p>
<p>雖然這位朋友的理論，未免的有些兒歪曲，但是平心靜氣的一想，這話却也是無法反駁的。我有一位親戚，從前曾熱戀着一位舞女，互訂着婚嫁之的，於是逼着他父母，把從前定着鄉間的未婚妻退了，而與那舞女，實行同居。但同居之後，這舞女，却因揮霍成性一時無法緊縮，累得他經濟的周轉，極感拮据。而同時呢，那舞女，因度慣着紅燈綠酒的生活，也頗不慣於安居而為少奶奶。因着偶然一句二句的頂撞，夫妻倆便衝突起來。跟着，那舞女，便發動着涉訟而離婚了。我那親戚，經此創之後，忽然大覺大悟了，重倩泳人，向退掉的未婚妻家再求婚，而重為夫婦。這一回事屈指迄今，已有四個年頭了，生了二個孩子。他的夫人，對他還是像初婚時那麼的惟誠惟敬，雙方都感着非常的滿意。</p>
<p>白開水我想或許眞比茶與咖啡有意味。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜蘭人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>當自己這樣坐下定神的時候，情不自禁的，伸手到懷裏，把那封信掏了出來。將全部信紙三張，分作兩部分。先折疊好兩張，依然塞到信封裏去，却騰出一張信紙，兩手捧着看。另外的那個信封，可就放在桌子抽屜裏，而且把身子擋了抽屜口，好像有人要開抽屜來搶這封信似的。他把三張信紙，一張張的全看過了，最後將桌子輕輕一拍，又下了一回决心，把信怱怱的收起，然後伏在桌上，就寫起信來。但是只寫了一面信，突然的又想起了一件心事似的，立刻站了起來，將一疊沒有字的信紙，把寫好的張先蓋上，接着把書架子上那些心愛的雜誌，抽了兩本，放到桌上，隨手翻了兩面，翻出章唳天所作的小說，看了兩遍。其中一篇翻譯的小說，有如下一段對白：</p>
<p>麗娜，汝平心言之，不愛我耶？我愛君，君亦愛我男女間之結合，除此尙另有若何要件耶？我所謂結合，非必嫁娶之事，但言天地之間，惟我二人爲最相愛，則自各得一種精神上之安慰。至少可信宇宙中，已身以外，不盡無關之人。至形式上之結合，此良難盡如人願，但不如願，亦屬無妨，我所求者，宇宙中有我一敬愛之人，亦卽此生信仰有所寄託。君不愛我，我亦作此想。君愛我，則我愛君之心益堅。而君之愛我，乃獨藏於心，不使我知，此誠百思不解其故。若曰，我知君愛我，我或有所不利，君姑忍之，猶可言也。然而君知之，我已知君愛我。君果能口吐一愛字，我必變爲天馬，生　凌空而飛。……</p>
<p>夢蘭看過之後，將書掩着，兩手便托了頭，沉沉的的對了燈出神。揭開書來，又看了一遍。自己也不出得點了兩點頭。那　靜立的孤燈。這時也增了一些光芒，因爲照見　對坐的人，頰上已是添了許多笑容了。他把雜誌收到書架上去。把寫好了那張信紙抽了出來，三把兩把的就撕了個粉碎。一齊都塞到痰盂子裏去。自言自語的道。置之不理，也就算了。回人家什麼信？於是第三次把國器的信抽出，再看個第三遍。這樣，的有半點鐘，信裏的字句，幾乎都可以背得過來，鼻子裏自哼一聲，第三次的把信紙鋪好，又寫起來。這次不是寫先前那張信紙，那困難。對了信裏爛熟的字句，以及剛　那篇小說的對白，引起了很多相反的意思。又不加點的，一口氣就寫了三張信紙。（四五）</p>
<h3>熱的閒話</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>「心定自然凉」，這是一句聊以自慰的謊話，在烈日下工作的人們，任你怎樣心定，不見得不在喊熱，反之那在冷氣四佈的屋子裏坐着的人們，嘴裏咬嚼五色冰淇淋隨你心裏怎麼的胡思亂想，也不會想出汗來。</p>
<p>水滸傳智取生辰綱裏白日鼠唱的歌曲，眞充滿着一股熱淚，一股不平之氣，我不知道多少人讀了會體會到其中的意思，詩云：「赤日炎炎如火燒，野田禾稻半枯焦。農夫心內如湯煮；公子王孫把扇搖」，這詩幸虧是前代人做的，要是現代人的手筆，一定會加上一個「普羅」文家家的頭銜。</p>
<p>在閱微草堂筆記裏說着：「一個士人，居室湫溢，又是西向的，一到暑天午後，晒得他神煩意亂，恨不得把這座屋子燒掉才好，一天他在室中打中覺，夢見給閻王抓去，受那刀山火鍋的刑罰，痛苦難熬，又夢見舟行大海，波濤洶湧，一會兒浪激舟沉，身遭沒頂，又驚駭萬狀，驚醒過來，始知並沒受刑，並沒舟破，心一安適遍體生凉，這時他看那狹狹的屋，窄窄的床，此瓊樓玉宇還舒適咧！」這段話却帶些哲理，「飢者易為食，渴者易為飮」，便是這層道理，熱也難逃此例。</p>
<p>冷訊　「冰淇淋製造法」，爲專家經騐之作，內容詳述各色各味之冰淇淋製造程序，及與人體衛生關係，文筆簡潔明暢，全書凡八章，厚約七十面，製法簡便，人人可能。每册定價二角，受讀者可投函上海郵政信箱一七三七號，昨承惠贈二册，特爲介紹。</p>
<h3>水乳交融？</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （吳吉人）</p>
<p>俯身金魚缸畔，許多的本年稚魚兒，看它們一天天的長成着，從針刺似的細小身軀裏，可以看得見吃了紅蟲在肚裹的紅印子，小魚的腹部，漸漸的，也正是全部機體在發育着，俗諺稅的「日長夜大」，對於金魚，我亦云然。</p>
<p>可是，一面小魚本身在長成着，而同時的一種害蟲「夾魚蟲」，也會吃着了小魚兒長成得更快，起初，在收子的時候，不是要安上水藻的嗎？那種小得目力所看不見的「夾魚虫」，巳經在水藻中帶進了缸來，每天，看見缸面上浮起了好多尾巴死的小魚，有的身首異處，有的頭尾無存，這，完全害在夾魚蟲的身上。</p>
<p>夾魚蟲長大了有寸外長，形態完金同「蝦」一樣，不過頭上沒有觸鬚，而且它的頭是扁的，嘴邊的一對雙鱉，小魚兒經它一夾，那才沒有命哩，所以秧魚缸中的夾魚蟲，若不快捉，整缸的魚會被它殺害了的。</p>
<p>還有幾千的小魚，生長不會平稱的，過了一個半月；有的已經很大，有的還是細微得很，這時候，你只要缸裏水蛆一吃完，大魚吃小魚，像這種同類相殘的慘劇，時時會發生的，發現了非立卽把大的捉去分養不可了。</p>
<p>同類相殘，弱肉强食，這是天演的公理，金魚還有人來殺除害蟲，萬物之靈的人類呢？那就儘够可憐了。</p>

<h3>內園初夏</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>「對不起，請站一站！」依然是拖扔詩翁的男子，揚着手呌</p>
<p>「幹嗎站一站？」初攔的紫棠色臉的人，推一推額上的銅盆帽。</p>
<p>「我們要拍照。」揚手的男子像求恕的聲音。</p>
<p>「拍你媽的照！關老子事？這又不是你的家？」紫棠色臉的人，瞪瞪白眼珠，推開那男子，逕自　進圈子的隙地。一邊在冷笑說：「真笑話！許你們拍照！不許　　走路！　認識」：這裏是大家的花園……。」</p>
<p>四面八方傳出了拍掌的巨響。早先瞇着眼圜成長　的瞧熱鬧的陣綫，被這幾句話搗破，漸漸凌亂。而拍照的男子和女人，也混在一陣騷動中苦惱地鑽進由洞去了。我馬上回頭看老詩翁，用懷疑的眼光，想微求他對於這件事情的意見，老詩翁微笑着對我說：</p>
<p>「這又不是一張挺好的照片？我們走　。天要下雨呢！」</p>
<p>我舉眼低空，見灰頹的陰雲已經消散，且露一鱗日肖，從岩格葉中漏出，不得不愚蠢地追間：</p>
<p>「不會下雨，天色轉好呢！」</p>
<p>「哦！誰知道？你敢决定在極度歡樂之後繼着不會有刻骨的苦痛嗎？」</p>
<p>那一句鐵似的靜言，半支烟前證實了他的價值。我還能借什麼理由　以　　呢。只得緩緩地扶着他歸去。黃昏的太陽極好，但暖風中，不知從何處送來了廉織的雨絲－－這便是初夏的徵候。（完）</p>

<h3>傳染性的性病　卽花柳病（四續）</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>—「淋病」—</p>
<p>但那裏曉得這樣的延擱了一兩天，外尿道　的腫脹突然急速加甚，包皮也起浮腫，時時有乳白色的分泌物流出，由此漸流漸濃，竟呈黃綠色的艦狀。同時，陰莖的背部疼痛，尿綫縮小，尿意頻數，小便初則溷濁，繼至斷續點滴，刺痛難忍！身心的痛苦，簡直不堪言狀。這樣的微象，就是急性淋病了。</p>
<p>差不多傳染了淋病的人，在最初兩三天內，往往不知趕緊診治，非到病勢驟劇，痛苦深重的時候，才會在疼痛和焦急的夾攻中，手足無措心慌意亂地求醫診治。（未完）</p>
<h3>治濁迅速斷根法</h3>
<p>治療淋病期需六星期之久。當為病家所焦急難耐。此蓋藥物選擇方面。大有斟酌。自最近治濁滅淋特效專藥內服黃色素製劑「安敵淋」發明後。因其藥力之宏偉。功效之卓著。故其治療期已不必如此之久。例如上月有患者來訴。有患急性淋病。為廉價劣藥所誤。無從治療。自投服「安敵淋」後。未及三星期。卽炎消痛止。尿澄濁凈。迅速回復其壯健。而生機亦重萌云。</p>
<h3>遺精的秘療</h3>
<p>— 劉志民醫師</p>
<p>現代的靑年男女，罹患遺精病的，確實指不勝屈了。假若用醫學的眼光來鑑別一下，那末因手淫而促成此病者，成分要占百分之八十以上。雖然有的因為生理上的關係，也會將精洩出，但是因病態的遺精惹起神經衰弱症的人們特別的多，眞可以說一聲「觸目都是。」總之不論是生理的關係而遺精，病態的原因而遺精，都是新喪人體精力最可怕的病症，允其在靑春的男女，能使你神經衰弱症在短期裏爆發，不但事業受嚴重的影響，你的生命也就加緊危險了。</p>
<p>所以我想指導一些關於自療的智識給你們，定然受你們的歡迎，那是無可疑義的，不過先要認明手淫的遺精純由身體剝削太劇烈的緣故，因此精關鬆弛，稍覺感觸，或全無感觸，也會遺出。那病象的險惡，也就可知了，</p>
<p>所以第一步的自療方法，先要將精一關治固，覓求具有治遺精功效的「希米脫氏的固精片」。再以培補虧損功能的「生殖素」補之，如此雙管齊下，祖保可以一勞永逸，不復再發了。</p>
<h3>骨痛肌麻治法</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>骨節痠痛一症。病變不一。如不加以澈底治療。則往往引起肌肉痠麻。筋絡抽孿。重則四肢麻木不仁。半身牽强不遂。全身瘓癱失靈。</p>
<p>本症治法。非僅去瘋除濕所能克奏膚功。蓋患者血份不潔。餘毒未凈。尿酸過多。血管硬化。如治不兼顧。何以根治。</p>
<p>名藥「强斯登氏骨痛片」。藥性純良。功效兼顧。用治上述種種病變。有面面顧到之妙。且藥性適合華人體質。故服後見效更速。最近余曾用以愈林君之遠年肢麻痼疾。為期未逾一月。據云服後效騐。遠出同類各劑之上云。</p>
<h3>月經不調乳峰萎頽</h3>
<p>— 王士英</p>
<p>人身腺官。以生殖腺為最重要。其有關於健康，病機，靑春，壽命。至重且大。例如女性如生殖腺素缺乏。則引起月經不調，宮冷腹痛，小產不育，乳峰萎頹等症。喪健失美。多病早老。生殖腺素關係之重要。有如是者。</p>
<p>土月有蔣夫人來診。據訴每逢行經。輒不調準。遷延失治。引起帶下腹痛等症。且失去原來乳峰豐腴之美姿。經余對症發藥。內外並治。囑向五洲藥房購內服「女用生殖素」外用「療帶靈」。雙管齊下。未及一月。經來調準。炎去帶凈。且身體回復壯健。乳房再返豐腴。充分表現其少婦應有之靑春美態云。</p>
<h3>遠年胃痛獲救</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>患者閔君。年四十八歲。江西人。在滬經商多年。早歲因興友朋戲耍賭食。致胃臟受傷。賁門幽門。兩遭其損。常苦作痛。劇時甚至昏厥不省人事。雖曾購服胃劑。但皆祇取效一時。未克根治。自以為不治。因循迄今。本年四月中旬。因見其至友李君患同樣之胃症。為余所治愈。始自投余處求治。余為根治計。卽囑向中英藥房購「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」並服之。痛源旣去。胃臟頓復健全。自此凜於前轍。深守余所囑保養之法云。</p>
<h3>未老先衰重返壯盛</h3>
<p>邵君來函云：鄙人現年三十有六。在二月前。人莫不以爲余必年在四十五六之間。面色蒼黃。皺紋縱橫。外表儼然垂垂欲老矣。而本身則腰痠背痛。頭暈目眩。健忘失眠。疲倦畏勞。又宛然一多病衰弱之軀。考其起因。一言難盡。要為營養不良。病後失調所致。後投吳大超醫師處診治。斷為生殖腺素缺乏。致形成神經衰弱症。囑向永安公司購服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」服之。遵囑連服四盒。果顯大效。皮膚回復彈性。皺紋盡去。血氣充實。面色紅潤。全身壯健。腰部有力。肌肉發達。精神旺盛。視之又若二十七八許少年矣。噫。若「生殖素」者。洵衰弱患者之無上救星也云。</p>
<h3>病理質疑（來信質疑須詳地址附覆信郵費）</h3>
<p>淋病復發</p>
<p>余於上年春季，因一度冶遊，染患淋病，旋曾服藥治愈，余因親嘗痛苦，故不敢再作狎邪遊，自無再度感染之理，故有三點，懇請答覆　今决之淋濁，若聽其自然，可有危險吾？　究用何種治療可以斷根？　今决復發之原因請為詳告。</p>
<p>答：　應速診治斷根，不然有陷睪丸炎或腎臟炎之危險。　以「安敵淋」最有根治之把握，可向中西藥房購之，</p>
<p>肺病預防</p>
<p>我曾經接近過很多著名的肺病專家，他們的意見，以爲要使肺病絕跡，除了在預防上注意之外，實在沒有較好的方法，據他們的理由是：」肺病沒有可靠的藥品治療，所以祗好平時預防」，所以我特地很關心的提出，向你討論一下；　頭防的方法怎樣？　可有肺病預防藥出售？</p>
<p>答：　肺病的預防，除了使身體强壯之外，以少接近肺病患者為最佳。因為身體强壯之後，則能抵抗結核菌的侵入，卽使被結核菌潛入，因身體抵抗力之强，自然消滅。　肺病預防藥，嬝好服「生殖素」使之體力强壯，常年服之，確有返老還童之功效，肺病永遠與你無緣了，這是預防肺病最有意義的經騐</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>狗剪髮公司</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>上海的十里洋塲，眞是無奇不有。別的不耍說，光是拿「狗」出來舉例子，花樣也實在不少。跑狗塲的拿狗來開玩笑，給紳士們賭博快樂，和狗醫生專替洋狗醫治奇難雜症傷風咳嗽，如今已變成家常便飯。便是不久以前也有一個新花樣，那便是狗飯店，專門開設給我們的中外豢狗階級的狗先生太太們，「光臨敝店」，招待週到，隨心所欲。從前希奇狗坐汽車，靠着電風扇乘風凉；現在可沒那末蠢，便算看見狗先生狗太太們坐到比人還要好的狗飯店裏吃飯，那種岸然的紳士姿勢，也不會大驚小怪了。這也是都市繁榮的一種。</p>
<p>現在又有人担心到狗先生狗太太們的「剪髮」問題了。據某報特訊，在憶定盤路及辣斐德路等地先後發現剪狗頭髮公司（Cut　Dogs　Hamr　Co．）營業性質是專替豢狗階級剪剃狗毛。此種公司一如理髮店，有各式各樣的花樣，代價分一元半，二元，四元，以五元為最高。剪時的需二十分鐘。剪時狗毫無痛苦。據說，這些狗剪髮公司開設以後，很多豢狗者都去交易，營業很不錯的樣子。</p>
<p>紳士們似乎對「牲畜」特別愛好，很久以前我們便聽到有「動物保護會」的組織，而且發命令來限制，甚而至禁丑虐待「牲畜」。可是我們却從來并未聽到人說要組織什末「窮人保護會」或「失業保護會」之類，這可見得紳士們的「牲畜」也是「得天獨厚與人無尤」。按此理推論，狗剪髮公司優待「狗」，也未嘗沒有道理了。雖然若干窮人，終年不得剪髮一决，可是高貴紳士們的「性畜」，剪一個髮，最低價格也得隻半洋。這樣看來，似乎太厚狗而薄「窮人」，不過，祗耍我們壓根兒明白這社會制度便不是厚「窮人」，反之而是剝削窮人的話那又可「釋然於懷」了。</p>
<h3>保安養老所訪問記</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>（本報特寫）本市醬園弄保安養老第二所，已於七月一日正式開幕；常時我曾驅車前往該所參觀。但後來，我想要多知道一點該所的歷史和組織，所以於昨天下午，我特地又到南市保安路該第一所去訪問了一番。</p>
<p>保安養老所是上海慈善團的一個附屬慈善機關，他剏辦於民國十九年，算起來到如今也有六七年的歷史了。－－據說：上海慈善團的主持者是一位姓祁的蘇州人，他經營的慈善事業很多。現在除了這保安養老所外，隸屬於上海慈善團的還有同仁輔元堂，同仁輔元分堂，游民習勤所，育嬰堂，利涉小菜塲，普益習藝所，婦孺救濟院，等不下十來處；此外，蘇州方面也有一個貧民救濟院，現在收容大的有四五百人。</p>
<p>這里，我想將我的印象所得，來介紹給社會人士：</p>
<p>進所手續該所因為鋻於一般無家可歸的老人，常常流浪街頭，為了年紀衰老，所以自已旣不能謀生，投奔又沒有去處，這情形很够悽慘的。因此，他們便以收容六十歲以上，而的確毫無依靠的孤獨老人—專收男性，女性不收—為職旨。進所的第一步手續；先行到該所去登一個記，經核准後，就須去找一個相當的保證人，俟該所派員調查屬實，卽可正式入所。惟有家屬及不滿六十歲者，得拒絕收容。進所時不需任何費用，以後的一切生活必需及衣服臥具，却全由所里供給。</p>
<p>管理情形關於該所的管理方法，算常完善：譬如所里的老人均編有號碼，其他一切用具，毛巾，衣服，　位亦有號碼編明，大家不得互佔，俾免發生爭奪的事情。</p>
<p>貯藏室里有衣櫥一百八十隻，櫥上均有號碼，每人得用一隻。室里並有職員管理。臥室里，每室是排例着十隻單人鐵床，床上冬季是一褥一被，現在是一蓆一薄被，亦有號碼編明。並且在每室十個人中間，攆其能幹者兩人為正副室長，室門口釘着一塊牌子，各人及正副室長的姓名就寫在上面。凡所里有事通知，須由正副室長傳達，而室里發生了什麼事情，或老人中有什麼需要時，亦由正副室長到辦公處去接洽。膳堂里的餐桌，却彷彿課堂里的書桌似的，很整齊的排列着，每桌九人，座位上亦有號碼，各入必須按號入座，而且，每號</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>有一隻小抽屜，這抽屜里是安放各人碗筷的，喝茶，也每人有一隻搪磁盃。在一走廊里，還有許多獨人竹椅，這也是每人一把，是讓他們去隨時搬動的；他們歡喜到那兒去坐，便可自由到那兒去坐</p>
<p>在所里的老人平時絕對不能出外，而遇有違犯所規等情，輕則感化或略加斥責，如姑惡不悛者得開除，但這種情形是很少發生的。</p>
<p>日常生活他們的日常生活是非常機械化的。每天三餐，早晨粥，中午飯，晚上半粥半飯。終年吃素，平常是每人一菜，每月照例也有四天加菜，是逢二日，八日，十六日，二十四日，這四日中，每人就有兩碗小菜一餐。半個月理髮一决，現在，每天必須洗操一次</p>
<p>他們吃過了飯，都可以自由地在所里找消遺，各隨自己的歡喜，或念佛，或看書閱報，或散步談天，或睡覺，或種花澆菜，而且種花澆菜還可得到所里的獎賞。如果他們高興作點什麼有益的玩意兒，那末，所里也會供給他們所需要的束西；不過絕對禁止他們喧譁爭噪</p>
<p>關於經費該所原是上海慈善團所設立的，所以一切經費均係上海慈善團所撥給。現在所里吃米，平均每天需一石餘（夏天稍减），其餘衣服用具，蔬菜油鹽，及職員工役之薪金等一概在內，每年總要一萬元以上。—地產和房屋都是上海慈善團自己的。</p>
<p>病死處置這里的老人，患了疾病也是要由所里負責，病重的送醫院，病輕的就在所里療養室中請醫診治，而且日夜也有看護守。如果死了，倘有親戚族人願來收殮者聽便，如果沒有人來收殮，亦歸所中料理。</p>
<p>所址一瞥這里共有地產四十多畝，計建有房屋七十二間，那房屋雖是平屋，但很軒暢，且每間後面均有兩個窗口，建築的式樣亦是新式，門和窗都是玻璃的。前後共有兩個大天井，兩個小天井，四周皆有走廊，空氣十分流通，火天井中央都有一個花壇，壇里種着各式各樣的花卉。前面更有一個小型的圖藝塲，佔地的二十多畝，中間除了一條小河流之外，還有一個作物間和一間小花室，那兒，植着許多瓜果蔬菜及花卉盆景，這些都是他們在寂寞時留下來的或績然而，據說所申對於做這些事情的人，也有獎賞的，就是他們願意做一天，也就有一天的獎賞。但是，那都是　於他們的自動，所里並不强制，</p>
<p>房屋部份的設備，計有十八個臥室一個貯藏室，一個佛堂，一個療養室，一個煮藥問，一個廚房，一個洗　間，一個　宣，一個　堂，一個辦公室，一個職員臥室，一個工役臥室，一個職員厠所，一個工役厠所，一個熱水個，一個房間，一個物件堆存間，以及幾個老人小便間。至於那些地方，有三四房間屋作一個室的，也有一二個房屋作一室的，而每個室里的光綫空氣都很充足，環境方面亦可以說是極其幽靜的。</p>
<p>現在該所已收容老人一百八十名，因已額滿，一時無法再收，而各機關移送及要求登記者仍多；故又在醬國弄分設了一個第二所那里本來原是貧民診療院，也是上海慈善團辦的，房屋有十多間，及一個寬大的樓，也有一個大天井空氣光綫環境和第一所差不多，不過缺少一片曠地。組織及辦法也是依照第一所的，但限額只有四十名，所以在七月一日開幕時，額子早已滿了，以後必須俟原額中减少了人，方再可收容。</p>
<p>僱員方面。現在第一所里有職員七人，工役十多人，第二所里亦有職員四人，工役六七人。</p>
<p>年來各省提倡敬老，並且舉行敬老會：但他們所敬的只是一些有錢的老人，至於那些廣大層里的，被人們遺忘的貧苦老人是不會給他們注意到的。</p>
<p>救救這些貧苦老人吧！</p>
<h3>走私猖獗聲中來　談談婦女們的裝飾</h3>
<p>— 文海</p>
<p>中國是一個半殖民地的國家，也是一個各列强銷售過剩商品的角逐塲，因而各列强都可借它們在中國所佔的優越地位，向中國民衆有計劃的作各方面榨取與剝削！</p>
<p>現在華北正鬧着走私問題，日趨嚴重，也正是有計劃侵略我中國的一貫毒辣政策的實行，走私問題的日益擴大，不但要影饗中國政府的財政收入，更且還能加速率來摧殘中國的工商實業，若輩是欲使中國孱弱的民族工業，永遠地陷於萎糜不振而頹唐的狀態。</p>
<p>據聞走私的貨物，其中除疋頭糧食人造絲及兒童玩具之外，大都是婦女界的化裝品，要占重要的地位了，婦女界所消耗的香粉香水胭脂香膠等等，每年中國的漏巵多少，據海關報告，已早刊各報了，贅不再述。</p>
<p>愛美是人類的天性，允其是婦女們富於愛美性，認為裝飾是愛美條件之下產生的，更共是在繁華的都市裏的婦女，大家爭姘鬥奇，把整個的生活時間，幾乎為裝飾所全佔據了，在這愛美裝飾者的身上，全國的婦女界，光陰的浪費，和金錢的損失，恐怕難以計數了。</p>
<p>申報六月十七日本埠新聞欄中載着一則新聞，說的是一九三六年之摩登服飾，其中詳載是西人服我夏布，蓋我國所產之夏布，係用麻來織成的，旣耐穿，又美觀，更且價鈿又便宜，西人目中竟以夏布為今年的最摩登服飾，回顧國入，　拾夏　而穿舶來品的綢紗，金錢外　，其合不上算，</p>
<p>走私事件不解决，將致我國人於死命，這是多麼的危險！然而怎能够使走私問題得到澈底的解决？政府頒佈緝私條例和嚴懲走私附和者，這是沒用的，要報本的解决辦法，希望國人合作起來抵制這走私事件。</p>
<p>帝國主義的壓迫，已到最後的階段了，希望全國的婦女們，速早覺悟，要將這種艱巨的責任負担起來，挽救中華民族的危亡。像阿比西尼亞的婦女們一樣，和丈夫同上前綫去，起來！不願做奴隸的人們！</p>
<h3>麥子</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>大淸早，根壽叔站在扶梯脚邊，手叉在腰裏，抬着頭向黯沉沉的閣樓上儘嘮嘮叨叨地罵：「你害了懶黃病嗎，死樣怪氣的，你可知道天熱糧食行收市收得早，快點，快點，懶貨……</p>
<p>黯沉沉的閣樓上現出一個女人的腦袋來，紮着却花布頭巾），臉色是悽然的，遲緩地用繩束扣縛籮沿，籮裏滿滿的裝着麥子，她並沒害病，祇是每粒麥子光潤的形體，標亮的土黃色和逗人食慾亢進的香氣，挑引起她心坎的無限悲哀。從背着毒烈的太陽，攢在尖銳的芒刺裏，讓濕熱的地蒸氣把自已的眼睛薰灼得昏糊，而抓住鐮刀割上田…直到甩出粒子，曬過又曬，搬上閣樓，扔進木櫃，還不上一個月，如今却要賣出去了。</p>
<p>「這麼一籮够了吧，」說着，邊把那籮麥子，緩緩吊下。她的視錢亦跟着吊落地。根壽嬸嬸並不是怎樣嗇吝的女人，可是對於出賣麥子，就着實捨不得。</p>
<p>「一籮兩籮，不是我賣掉去吃着嫖賭的，你種的誰家的田，不要付租嗎，你下過多少豆餅，不要還賬嗎？大隆裏那十槐錢儘償大利息嗎，你坐在家裏，你懂得什麼？這幾天麥子行市好，不逞勢口賣掉點還人家，拖延得過嗎？我難道不想老老面皮欠下去……」「根壽叔低俯着頭解掉籮沿口的繩束，一邊用斗量，一邊儘沒結沒完的嘮叨着。當他用手掌去刮平斗面的麥子，而感着一種滑潤的觸覺時，心裏又未嘗不難過呢？這難過，是就隱伏於他嘮叨的話語中。</p>
<p>根壽說老在人家面前說—卽使在十字路口碰着陌生過路客：</p>
<p>「唉，誰瞧我不是個肯吃苦肯巴結的人呢，一年到頭不瞎化一個細（小）錢，烟管不該，燒酒不上口，茶店不踏進，賭更不必說，可是一熟一熟收成都不知到什麼地方去了，田裏上來就要賣，等後來反而東借一升西借一斗，我自己也不相信，一年一年，為了誰白忙？」」</p>
<p>有時候，甚至對他自己的女人亦這樣嘆說一遍。</p>
<p>當根壽嬸嬸把第二籮麥子吊落的地時侯，他又隨口滑出了一連串：重複嚕囌的「你坐在家裏，你懂得什麼？這幾天麥子行市好，不逞勢口賣掉點……」埋怨他女人的話。根壽嬸嬸默忍不住了，她在閣樓上拭一拭，淌到眼皮邊的汗珠說道：「行市好，麥市好，怎的桂林公公家該幾百擔麥子，行老闆上門他亦不賣呢？他不知道行市好嗎？」似乎，她握住了一個有力的引證加以駁斥。</p>
<p>可是，這引證在根壽叔耳裏却成為一種刺激，而刺激的反應又是一陣嘮叨：「你說桂林公公家的幾百擔麥子，你知道他為什麼不賣嗎，你死亦不會知道的，他不等錢用，只有人欠他的，沒有他欠人的。他囤在家裏預備將來殺窮鬼，他的大舅子做麵粉廠，市面多靈通，他愁什麼！他要等別人全捧着肚皮時，才開倉討價，我們同他比嗎，你在做白天夢，你在發熱……</p>
<p>根毒嬸　把空籮吊上閣樓去，悽然的容顏消失在沉黯中。</p>

<p>開篇「嘆五更」</p>
<p>靜德醼樓一鼓。娘娘獨坐淚雙拋。只爲，兒夫出外無消息。行踪不定在那裏跑。一莫不是，他鄉別戀多情女。更比奴奴才學高。因此上，消息沉沉難捉摸。害奴家，坐聽二鼓氣難消。良人呀，想你臨行說得天花墜。說甚麼，一到京中就揮毫。好音兒傳達美多姣。可憐奴，偏候書信信不到。又好比，風箏斷錢音息杳。三更過。四更交。奴是形單影隻意蕭條。冤家呀。可憐奴，愁腸百結恨難消。娘娘是，畏吁短嘆少顧問。那凄凉苦境更難描。噯……郎君呀。假使你，拋不下，多情多義多姣羊。也可携歸共一巢。兩馬不妨合同槽。奴奴决不生嫉忌。姊妹相呼樂陶陶。恨只恨，郎心不如奴心意。空留好意匿人嘈。苦只苦，夜長夢短難消遣，只聽見，城樓隱隱五鼓敲。一聲兒低。一聲兒高。一聲兒遠。一聲兒飄。聲聲相應哭牢騷。如此凄凉如此過。娘娘更覺苦無聊。驀聽見，四壁蟲聲如泣訴。嘆五更哭壞了美多姣憑你鐵打心腸也動搖。</p>

<p>開篇「吊荷」</p>
<p>驕陽艷照藕花塘。玉立亭亭似六郎。竟體羅衣誰不羨。分香蜻蜓往來忙。濃情結得鴛鴦伴。　臂盟深日月長。曾記得翩翩風度何郎貌。曾記得綽的風姿傲水鄉。閒情爭說神仙艷。並蒂花開世界香。恨只恨暫時歡樂難持久。霎時間秋風已作十分凉。輕羅衣袖嫌單薄。勢利鴛鴦亦不相莊。想當時翠袖臨風馳聘日。曾書姓氏報王昌？到今朝，夏盡秋來難如意。連那些，殘枝敗葉也不舒香。炎凉世態眞可恨。回憶前塵夢一塲。勸世人，莫道炎天容易過。到秋凉，酸辛滋昩自親嘗。我吊荷花兼諷世。並非是，唐突到六郎。悲秋宋玉自心傷</p>

<h3>Guangdong Expands Police and Guard Force, Intensifying Military Preparations; Weng Zhaoyuan Recruits Old Subordinates to Go to Yong; Rumors of Bandit Activity in Southwestern Guangxi Cause Complete Suspension of Business Between Hong Kong and Wuzhou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Chen Weizhou took office as the Guard Commander, he plans to organize three divisions and twelve regiments to establish a unique banner. Chen Jitang also plans to transfer all provincial guard teams under his command (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th).</p>

Currently, business between Hong Kong and Wuzhou has completely halted (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the past few weeks, the situation in Guangxi Province has become increasingly chaotic, so almost all foreign missionaries in the province have left. Most of the remainder have gathered in Wuzhou. Only two Americans remain in Nanning. According to reliable sources from southern China, the internal situation in Guangxi Province is becoming increasingly serious. Bandits are especially active in the southwestern part of the province. Due to food shortages, Wuzhou and other counties will implement rationing and fixed prices. Guilin is close to the Guizhou border, and the Guangxi authorities are heavily defending it, having ordered all women and children in the city to relocate (Reuters dispatch, 7th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi Province is facing financial difficulties. Cangwu has started collecting license fees for the sale of cattle, horses, and live pigs. For cattle and horses, it's six jiao per head if they weigh less than 50 jin. Pigs are divided into two categories, four jiao and two jiao. Butchers are complaining loudly (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th).</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Petition Delegation, because the Douglas Steamship Company refused to sell tickets, remained in Hong Kong on the 6th. About forty people have withdrawn under various pretexts. The Guangxi student petition delegation took the same action as that delegation. Hong Kong police issued an order on the 6th limiting the delegation to leave Hong Kong within three days (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Petition Delegation, unable to purchase ship berths, decided to return to the province by train on the 8th to disband the team (Special dispatch, 7th).</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to an official announcement today, the three hundred representatives from all sectors of Guangdong Province who planned to go to the capital to petition the Central Committee will return to the province from Hong Kong tomorrow. The representatives originally planned to take the Douglas Steamship Company's mail ship President Jackson to Shanghai, but the Douglas Steamship Company refused to allow them to board any of its ships and canceled all their reserved cabins. Other shipping companies operating between Hong Kong and Shanghai refused to sell tickets to them, so they had no ship to board and returned to the province in disappointment (Reuters dispatch, 7th).</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Many members of the Guangdong Petition Delegation were unwilling to go north and announced the dissolution of the team at noon on the 7th. At 5:00 PM, the delegation hosted the Hong Kong press at the Queen's Restaurant and declared that they would all return to the province on the 8th (Shenshi News Agency dispatch, 7th).</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang and Others Respond to the Telegram of He Yingqin and Others</h3>
<p>Telegrams to Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi Urging Attendance at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Zhang Xueliang, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, Zhu Shaoliang, Shao Lizi, Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, Wang Jun, Mao Bingwen, Deng Baoshan, Wang Yizhe, Dong Yingbin, Sun Weiru, Feng Qinzai, He Zhuguo, Xiao Zhichu, Tang Enbo, and others, in response to the telegram of He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Zhu Peide, and others to the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities (dated the 26th), jointly telegraphed Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi, urging them to consider the overall situation, abandon personal opinions, withdraw their troops from Hunan, and attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee to jointly discuss the grand strategy of resisting the enemy and defending against insults. The original telegram reads: Urgent. Guangzhou Mr. Chen Bonan, Nanning Mr. Li Delin, and Mr. Bai Jiansheng: We have recently learned from the newspapers that Mr. He Jingzhi and others have sent you a telegram, expressing their words earnestly and in detail. We believe you have already read it. Since September 18th, the violent Japanese have invaded and insulted us without end. Anyone with blood and spirit does not want to resist the enemy and save the nation. However, we are incompetent, either receiving the mandate to suppress bandits or bearing the responsibility to govern the people. Besides fulfilling our duties, we often think of the deepening national humiliation and increasing external regrets. How can we not think of volunteering to resist Japan and fight for the survival of the nation and race? You have shown your patriotic enthusiasm, raising the banner to resist Japan. If your sincerity is unwavering and consistent, the people of the country will naturally express their sympathy, and we especially admire you. However, considering the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, the relationship between victory and defeat is extremely important. If the Central Government does not have a complete and detailed plan, and the country does not have a unified approach, but only local and partial efforts, it will inevitably be defeated by the enemy one by one. For several years, our Central Government and the officers in charge of military affairs have not been unaware of the demands of the times and the trends of public opinion, but they have ultimately endured humiliation and dared not try lightly. This is also the reason. You are intelligent and outstanding, and loyal to the country. You should not be unaware of the environment, and you should not be without a sense of weighing the importance of matters. Our humble opinion is that if you do not want to save the country, then so be it. If you want to save the country, you should carefully consider what Mr. He and others have said, attend the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee as scheduled, or send responsible officials to the capital to discuss the grand strategy. Then the national policy will be decided by the consensus, and the overall situation will be planned by the Central Government. For you, it can show that there are no other intentions. For the country, victory can be expected. For you and for the public, this is the best plan. At this time of national crisis, when life and death are at stake, all of us Chinese people, all of us comrades-in-arms, should only have the thought of forgetting ourselves for the country. How can we tolerate the suspicion of taking personal revenge? We are confident that we dare not lag behind others in patriotism. Therefore, whether we approve of our comrades-in-arms and the people of the country is only based on whether they forget themselves for the country. We sincerely offer our advice, hoping that you will understand our hearts. We are sailing in the same boat and are willing to hear your wise teachings. Zhang Xueliang, Zhu Shaoliang, Yang Hucheng, Shao Lizi, Yu Xuezhong, Ma Hongkui, Ma Bufang, Wang Jun, Mao Bingwen, Deng Baoshan, Wang Yizhe, Dong Yingbin, Sun Weiru, Feng Qinzai, He Zhuguo, Xiao Zhichu, Tang Enbo and others bow in unison, sealed with the official seal (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th).</p>

<h3>Prospects for the Advancement of Cooperative Enterprises</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>In recent years, cooperative enterprises, thanks to promotion and advocacy, have shown considerable rapid progress. Jiangsu, Hebei, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces have been the most developed. Recently, provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Henan have also been catching up rapidly. Some have over a thousand societies, and in major cities, Shanghai leads with over a hundred societies. According to overall data, there were over 26,000 societies nationwide by the end of 1935. However, considering the vastness of the region, these twenty-six thousand societies are not enough to be considered numerous. Moreover, it is difficult to say how many of them truly live up to their name and are effective. It is clear that cooperative enterprises need greater effort.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of the theory of cooperative enterprises. The problem is that cooperative enterprises have not been able to fully realize their benefits. The reasons for this are: First, it is difficult to unify the intelligence of the people, and it is easy to start but difficult to complete. Second, it is not easy to organize; there is a need but no cultivation. Third, the business is not small; it starts simple and becomes large. Therefore, even in terms of credit cooperatives, their general rural lending operations have not shown any actual results. Paper reports on cooperative enterprises are already dazzling and beautiful, but in reality, how to make the people understand the benefits of cooperatives still requires our efforts.</p>
<p>Some believe that the most urgent task today is to promote consumer cooperatives. This is indeed true. Are not the lower and middle classes in urban life the most in need of consumer cooperatives? And are not the people in urban areas more enlightened? However, the number of people in large cities who enjoy the benefits of consumer cooperatives seems to be limited. Existing consumer cooperatives, even those that claim to be perfect, still need to be supervised. Others below them exist in name only or are simply shops for profit.</p>
<p>The benefits of cooperatives belong to the public, but the psychology of the general public emphasizes personal gain. The abnormal development of cooperatives is naturally due to the customs and habits of the people. To fundamentally realize the true spirit of cooperatives, we must also pay attention to the cultivation of public virtue. I believe that even if cooperatives are established among the ignorant masses, those who manipulate them are others, and their organization cannot be considered sound. Some may say that it is not difficult to implement this in a coercive way, so that cooperative enterprises can be expected to develop greatly. This intention is certainly not wrong, but if cooperation is still used as a tool to decorate the facade, even if it flourishes for a while, the reality may be even more unbearable.</p>
<p>I believe that talking about cooperation today is like teaching elementary school students. It is important to demonstrate and lead by example, so that people will follow without being ordered. Therefore, those who are experienced in cooperative enterprises should rise up and establish cooperatives with like-minded people. The so-called "sitting and talking is not as good as getting up and doing." Make the public aware of the feelings and opinions, and cooperation will have a solid prospect of development. It is best to guide existing businesses with cooperative characteristics, rectify their shortcomings, and supplement their deficiencies. It does not have to be called cooperation, but only to have the substance of cooperation. What do the contemporary scholars think?</p>

<h3>Germany Assures Britain and France: No Desire to Disrupt European Situation</h3>
<p>Eden Acknowledges the Danzig Issue Remains Serious - Over 100 Opposition Party Members Arrested in Danzig</p>
<p>(London) During last night's Cabinet meeting, Foreign Secretary Eden strongly stated that the current situation in Danzig contains serious possibilities. The Cabinet will continue to consider this matter at its meeting on Wednesday. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British and French ambassadors visited the German Foreign Ministry this evening to meet with Foreign Minister Neurath. As Mr. Neurath was away on official business, they were received by another official. This official assured them that Germany has no intention of taking any steps that would disrupt the current international situation. It is reported that the two ambassadors also inquired about Germany's attitude toward the speech made by Danzig Senate President Greiser at the League of Nations Administrative Council on July 4. The spokesperson replied that the German government fully supports this speech. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Danzig Senate President Greiser, who departed from Geneva, made a brief stopover here on his way back to his post. Today, he spent the entire day consulting with officials of the National Socialist Party. The subject of their discussion has not been announced. It is rumored that National Socialist Party officials have ordered Greiser to adopt a more cautious attitude in the future. Political figures have recently stated that Germany and Poland have a tacit understanding and that there should be no discord due to the Danzig issue. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Danzig: Senate President Greiser returned here today, but local residents did not give him a "warm welcome." Only a small number of National Socialists and stormtroopers greeted him at the station. This is because Greiser requested that special preparations for the welcome be canceled. It is widely believed that both Berlin and Danzig do not want to stir up trouble, hence Greiser's request. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Yesterday, a total of 150 members of the opposition party in the Danzig city government were arrested. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Germans Advocate for a Plebiscite on Danzig</p>
<p>Resolving the Future Sovereignty Issue</p>
<p>(Berlin) Danzig Free City Senate President Greiser visited here a few days ago and held talks with National Socialist Party officials until midnight before hurrying back to the city. Diplomatic circles here have recently expressed their views on the situation in the city, stating that the current system in the city may be changed through a plebiscite. Regarding this matter, Danzig National Socialist Party branch leader Forster made a suggestion when he met with Führer Hitler and Aviation Minister Göring. German sources also said that if the city holds a plebiscite, Germany has a good chance of winning, just like the Saar region plebiscite in January of last year. (7th Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Danzig Free City Senate President Greiser and reporters from the city's newspapers departed from Geneva together by plane. En route, he made a statement to a reporter from the National Socialist Party's newspaper Vorwärts, stating that "The Free City of Danzig has sovereignty, but the High Commissioner of the League of Nations is now interfering in its internal affairs. This situation cannot be allowed to continue, and it must be permanently eliminated." Political figures are paying close attention to Greiser's remarks. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Sandys, known for his pro-German stance, advocated in the House of Commons today that a plebiscite be held in the Free City of Danzig to decide the future of the Free City. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that "The Danzig issue should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The countries most closely related to this issue are Germany and Poland. This is something that Mr. Sandys should pay attention to." Another MP asked the Foreign Secretary whether the British government intends to negotiate with the German government regarding Germany's current construction of defensive fortifications in the Rhineland. The Foreign Secretary replied that "The government is still willing to conduct general negotiations with the countries concerned and Germany in order to resolve various issues. Therefore, the issue of the Rhineland defensive fortifications should not be raised unilaterally by Britain to Germany." (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon in the Cabinet Room of the House of Commons. First, they listened to Foreign Secretary Eden's report on the proceedings of the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council meeting, which was duly noted. Next, they studied the issue of the city of Danzig, and finally, they discussed the future meetings of the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact. According to sources in political circles, the most important issue discussed at today's Cabinet meeting was the issue of the city of Danzig. As a result of their deliberations, the Cabinet members unanimously agreed that the President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig, Greiser, had made arrogant statements at the Administrative Council of the League of Nations, saying that he was speaking on behalf of the entire German nation. The implication of these words was that German Führer Hitler not only considered himself a representative of Germany, but that all nations that speak the German language, including the city of Danzig, the Memel Autonomous Region, and the residents of Austria, as well as the minority ethnic groups within the territory of Czechoslovakia, were all represented by him. It is reported that because the Polish government recently promised to adopt a firm attitude to deal with Germany, the Cabinet decided to temporarily leave the Danzig issue to Poland to handle. If Poland fails to fulfill its promise, the British government will submit the issue to the League of Nations for handling again. But in any case, when the Locarno Conference is held in the future, the Danzig issue will definitely be brought up for discussion. In addition, regarding the British list of questions, the German reply will definitely be ambiguous and difficult to understand. In order to fully understand Germany's views, the British government will request that the League of Nations be invited to attend the second stage of the Locarno Conference in order to provide oral explanations on the points in Germany's future reply that are still unclear, and that this is a necessary condition for Germany's participation in the Locarno Conference. The British Cabinet now hopes that the Locarno Conference will not only discuss the issue of re-establishing the original spirit of the Locarno Pact, but also study the issue of resolving the general situation in Europe. Before the European situation is resolved, the temporary measures that Britain had previously promised to aid France and Belgium will naturally remain in effect. However, the permanent measures to protect the borders of the two countries contained in the annex to the previous letter to the two countries will not be considered at this time.

<h3>German-Austrian Negotiations Break Down: Hitler Rejects Four Conditions</h3>
<p>(Vienna) According to official sources today, the negotiations between Germany and Austria for reconciliation have broken down, and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg believes that there is currently no possibility of a solution. It is said that Schuschnigg, through the German Ambassador Papen, conveyed four conditions to German Führer Hitler: 1. Germany fully recognizes the independence of Austria; 2. Germany allows Austria not to interfere in its internal affairs; 3. Germany recognizes that Austria has full autonomy in all matters concerning Austria, such as the restoration of the monarchy, etc.; 4. Hitler abandons the Austrian National Socialist Party. After these conditions were put forward, the negotiations failed, and Schuschnigg has decided to base his political policy on the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in order to avoid the National Socialist Party controlling Austria. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The reconciliation negotiations between Austrian Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg and German Ambassador to Austria Papen, which took place in the middle of last week, have failed, so there is no hope of easing the current serious situation. It is reported that the failure of the negotiations was due to Germany's demand to allow the National Socialist Party in Austria to freely express its opinions and carry out "cultural work," and to pay attention to anti-Jewish actions. Germany also refused to agree to the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty. The main conditions put forward by Austria were that Germany declare respect for the current borders and allow non-interference in Austria. If so, then Stalin would grant amnesty to the Austrian National Socialist Party criminals. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Montreux Conference Discusses British Amendment</h3>
<p>Soviet Union Temporarily Takes a Reserved Attitude - Italy Declares It Will Still Not Participate</p>
<p>Montreux: The Montreux Conference recently held a plenary session and decided to use the plan proposed by the British representative this morning as the basis for discussion. This plan is an amendment to the new convention draft proposed by Turkey. The Soviet Union is not very welcome to this amendment, but the Turkish representative has reached a compromise with the British representative in Geneva, so it is accepted. Here are the main points:</p>
<p>The Turkish draft proposed that for any non-Black Sea littoral country, the number of warships allowed to pass through the straits during peacetime be limited to one cruiser and two destroyers, and that the total tonnage not exceed 14,000 tons. It is now proposed to change this to 15,000 tons. The original draft proposed that the total tonnage of warships allowed to stay in the Black Sea from non-Black Sea littoral countries not exceed 28,000 tons, which is now proposed to be changed to 30,000 tons, and may be increased to 45,000 tons in special circumstances.</p>
<p>In the event of a threat of war, Turkey may only close the straits with the approval of a two-thirds majority of the League of Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The original draft proposed that the tonnage and number of warships from various countries passing through the straits during wartime should be the same as during peacetime. It is now proposed that during wartime, warships from various belligerent countries may freely pass through the straits to pursue enemy warships without any restrictions.</p>
<p>The Turkish draft did not mention the existing Straits Commission. It is now proposed that the commission should continue to exist, but its organizational law should be formulated separately, and its future functions should focus on preparing statistics and providing information.</p>
<p>Any warship from another country with a mission of courtesy visits or invitations may be invited by Turkey to pass through the straits without restriction.</p>
<p>Once the countries concerned have signed, the new convention will immediately take effect. The signatory countries may conclude a separate protocol with Turkey, allowing the country to install defensive fortifications in the straits area.</p>
<p>The Turkish draft originally proposed that the new convention be valid for 15 years, which is now proposed to be changed to 50 years, with a revision allowed every five years.</p>
<p>In addition, at today's meeting, the Turkish delegation also agreed to reduce the health tax levied on commercial ships from various countries passing through the straits by 60%. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Montreux: The Dardanelles Straits Conference reconvened here today to consider the draft of the new convention proposed by Turkey. Britain proposed an amendment to resolve the issue of the straits' fortifications and set a term of 50 years. This amendment is contained in a memorandum that stipulates the tonnage of warships allowed to pass through the straits. However, there is another clause that stipulates that in the event of a war in which Turkey maintains neutrality, the belligerent countries have the right to send an unlimited number of troops into the Black Sea. In addition, it is also stipulated that if Turkey believes that its country is threatened by war, it has full discretion over the passage of foreign ships through the straits, and it is also stipulated that a straits commission be established and bear special and limited responsibilities. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov stated that he intends to reserve his attitude towards the British amendment until he receives instructions from his government. However, the Soviet authorities will definitely not be as satisfied with the British proposal as they were with the original Turkish plan. The British proposal would prevent the 23,000-ton Soviet battleship Paris Commune, which is docked in the port of Sevastopol, from sailing out, and would also prevent the Soviet Union from maintaining a fleet of warships in the Black Sea to deal with war. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political circles here are now warning the great powers not to assume that Italy will accept any agreement created in Montreux. If the Black Sea becomes a Soviet lake with a fleet of ships that can freely enter the Mediterranean, the balance of power in Italy's inland sea will change. Italy may deem it necessary to expand its navy. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy officially announced today that it has no intention of participating in the Montreux Conference. All European observers were shocked by this news. Since European countries have already reached a compromise with Italy on the Abyssinian issue, Italy could have actively participated in the conference. This announcement was truly unexpected.

<h3>Problem of Trafficking of Women and Children in the Orient</h3>
<p>International Conference to Be Held in Java Next Spring</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Labor MP Tunnahill raised a question to the government, saying that the League of Nations Administrative Council has consulted with the governments of the Near East, Middle East, and Far East on the problem of trafficking in women and children in the Orient. Can the results be heard? Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the League of Nations Administrative Council has been consulting with the governments concerned since 1933 and can convene a conference to discuss the issue of trafficking in women and children. This conference is scheduled to be held in Java in February 1937. France, China, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the authorities in Hong Kong and the Straits Settlements have all agreed to send representatives to participate. The United States will send observers to attend, and the Indian government also intends to send observers, but this has not yet been decided. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Protests to Japan Over Two Cases</h3>
<p>(London) It has recently been confirmed by officials here that the British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, recently protested to the Japanese government over two cases. One is the case of the brutal death of Japanese military officer Sasaki in Beiping, China. Two British army soldiers were charged with murder and were tried by the British consular court. The attitude adopted by Japanese officials toward this case was irregular. The other is the case of an Indian jeweler who was recently arrested by "Manchukuo" police in the South Manchuria Railway attached area in Changchun. This act conflicts with the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by British subjects in Manchuria. It is generally believed that after the "Manchukuo" government concluded an agreement with Japan to abolish the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by Japanese subjects, the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by other countries were declared invalid by the "Manchukuo" government.

<h3>Tokyo Mutiny Case Concludes: Verdict in the February 26 Incident: 17 Key Culprits Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>13 Junior Military Officers and 4 Civilians</p>
<p>Other Soldiers Who Acted Under Duress Were All Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The army's young officers, who aimed to "Showa Restoration" and murdered several key ministers, shook the world. This so-called February 26 Incident, after careful trial by the army's military court, and until 2 a.m. on the 7th, the army released the verdict document. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>The military court trial, regarding the February 26 Incident, involved one general, twenty former generals (of which two committed suicide immediately after the incident), three training officers, three non-commissioned officers, eighty-nine former non-commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers, three hundred and fifty-eight soldiers, and ten civilians. Among them, those accused by the authorities were one general, eighteen former generals, two non-commissioned officers, seventy-three former non-commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers, nineteen soldiers, and ten civilians. The verdict was announced on July 5 as follows: Former Army Infantry Captain Kiyosada Banda, Teruzo Ando, Lieutenant Anahide Kurihara, Katsuo Tsuishima, Tsuguo Takeshima, Takiaki Nakahashi, Seichu Moiki, Tadashi Sakai, Masaru Tanaka, Second Lieutenant Kanji Nakajima, Yu Yasuda, Hachiro Hayashi, Taro Takahashi, and civilians Takaji Muranaka, Asakazu Isobe, Zensuke Shibukawa, and Genichi Mizukami, the seventeen people recorded above, were all sentenced to death.</p>
<p>This morning at 2 a.m., the Army Ministry announced the main text of the February 26 Incident verdict and, at the same time, released its written reasons. The content details the causes, motives, plans, and preparations, and an overview of the actions. The final conclusion states that among the defendants, the generals, former generals, and important civilians, their feelings of deep concern for the country during this extraordinary situation, and the various matters in which some of the defendants decided to advance or retreat, are not without points that can be understood. However, their actions violated the imperial rescript, disregarded the national constitution and laws, disrupted the original meaning of the national army, and commanded the imperial army arbitrarily, stemming from rebellious behavior. Their crimes can be said to be serious. One part of the non-commissioned officers and soldiers who are guilty formed parties, armed themselves, and automatically participated in the rebellion. However, the other soldiers, etc., had no intention of participating, but due to obeying the orders of their superiors, and as comrades and other troops continued to move out, under these circumstances, they could not refuse to act. Moreover, after the incident occurred, they only acted according to orders, and now there is a clear indication of repentance. For these soldiers, the execution of their sentences is suspended. All the other soldiers are found not guilty. (7th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan of China and the government representative for the Olympic Games, arrived here this morning from the capital of Sweden. Afterwards, he gave a speech to our reporter, explaining the purpose of his trip. He said, "The reason for coming to Germany is to personally study education issues. I am very interested in the political evolution of Germany, especially the issues of national education, physical education, and military training. I believe that I will benefit greatly from meeting with Defense Minister General von Blomberg in the future regarding this matter." Mr. Dai is a famous politician. He then expressed his views on Sino-German relations, saying, "I hope that the relationship between China and Germany will become increasingly close. As for Sino-German trade, its total volume has already exceeded that of Sino-British trade by 3%. The quantity of German machinery exported to China is also higher than that of Britain and the United States. In addition, Germany has provided capital and materials for the Zhe-Yi Railway (that is, the railway from Hangzhou through Nanchang and Pingxiang, connecting with the Yuehan Railway). This railway has great value in terms of economy, politics, and military strategy. Regarding domestic affairs, I firmly believe that our great leader, General Chiang Kai-shek, will be able to effectively unify China. As for Sino-Japanese relations, Japan is China's neighbor, and we should achieve genuine peace with them. However, the key to making this a reality lies with Japan." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Ambassadors Gu and Guo Leave Geneva to Return to Their Posts</h3>
<p>Gu Says France's Attitude Towards the Far East Has Not Changed</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France, regarding the new French cabinet's Far East policy and its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese issue, asking for his opinion. Mr. Gu said that the French government's attitude towards the principles of alliance and the fulfillment of international treaty obligations is roughly the same as that of our country. This point has already been expressed by French Prime Minister Blum in the General Assembly. Although the Rhine region is now under threat, France is still willing to resolve the issue peacefully. France is currently preoccupied with European affairs and has no time to focus on the Far East. However, for the sake of its interests in China, its political attitude remains unchanged. France's attitude towards the smuggling incident in North China is also the same as that of other countries. Mr. Gu returned to Paris on the afternoon of the 6th, while Guo Taiqi left here on the morning of the 6th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Many Italian Soldiers in Addis Ababa Slit Their Throats in One Night</h3>
<p>Ethiopians Intensify Resistance as Rainy Season Arrives</p>
<p>(Cairo) Mr. Holmes, a former Reuters correspondent with the Italian army in the north, arrived here today from East Africa. He said that the Italian army will face a severe test when the rainy season begins in Ethiopia. Although the Italian army claims that the banditry situation in Ethiopia is not serious, it will still take many years to quell it. During the recent St. Michael's Festival, Ethiopians all swore to drive the Italian army out of Ethiopia. However, they plan to take action only after heavy rains frequently fall and Italian aircraft cannot operate. The Italians believe that the Ethiopians are more concerned with looting than resisting the Italian army. However, in the past two months, armed and well-equipped bandits have fiercely resisted the Italian army. One night, many Italian soldiers in Addis Ababa had their throats slit. The Italian authorities arrested dozens of suspects, including some Europeans. Although many were later released, the remaining ones were either forced to build roads or were beaten in prison. Italian troops are stationed in large cities because of difficult transportation with the interior and do not dare to venture far. Hundreds of Italian troops in Asba Safare are surrounded by thousands of armed Ethiopians. The Italian authorities say they currently have no way to rescue them. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Industry Develops Rapidly; Japan Seeks Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Plans to Actively Develop Heavy Industry in Manchuria</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the Soviet Union's military industry has developed greatly due to the successful completion of its two Five-Year Plans. It has built an industrial zone in the Far East, so it will no longer be necessary to transport military supplies from Europe to the Far East. The independence of military supplies in the Far East has already been established, which is particularly noteworthy. As for the Soviet Union's production capacity, according to the production plan for this year published by the Soviet Union, it is 14.5 million tons of pig iron, 16 million tons of steel, 135 million tons of coal, 30 million tons of kerosene, 4,000 aircraft, and 400 tanks. Furthermore, regarding the construction of industrial zones, after the completion of the Donbas industrial zone, the construction of Kuznetsk (a large-scale heavy industrial zone), Krivoy Rog (centered on the iron industry), Angara (a heavy industry based on hydroelectric power, accounting for 46% of the Soviet Union's total power generation), Bereznikovsky, and Sougaravan will all be actively carried out. As for quasi-military industries, various manufacturing plants for aircraft, automobiles, and weapons are being established in Khabarovsk, Irkutsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and other places. The Japanese Army, in view of the rapid progress of the Soviet Union's heavy industrial zones, plans to develop various resources in Manchuria and promote the development of heavy industry in conjunction with the new national defense preparation plan. Therefore, it will change the previous policy of developing Manchurian industries to a heavy industry-first principle. Based on the development of industry, urban planning will be carried out. In the future, heavy industrial zones will be built in "Manchukuo." If this plan materializes, the previously restricted development of iron and coal in Manchuria, as well as the aluminum industry, will flourish. Full efforts will also be devoted to coal liquefaction, etc. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>Cairo The Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations are now in their final stages. It is said that both sides are very satisfied. A legal expert from the British Foreign Office has arrived here to assist in drafting the treaty. It is expected that the representatives will travel to London before the end of the summer to sign the treaty. The authorities have not disclosed the contents of the treaty, but the public believes that the following points are reliable:</p>
<p>The treaty will be of a nature of alliance and friendship.</p>
<p>British troops will withdraw from Cairo and be stationed in Ismailia.</p>
<p>Egypt will ultimately be responsible for the defense of the country and the Suez Canal. However, the number of British troops stationed in Egypt will be reduced only after the Egyptian army has been sufficiently strengthened.</p>
<p>Egypt will be responsible for building a network of military roads so that troops can be quickly deployed to the east and west.</p>
<p>The British air force stationed in Egypt will be greatly increased. Large new airfields will be built in Abu Qir and Ismailia.</p>
<p>An important British naval base will be established in Alexandria. Britain plans to pay rent, or perhaps even establish an army base.</p>
<p>In the past, Anglo-Egyptian negotiations have often failed due to the Sudan issue. Although this issue has not yet been resolved, it is now believed that a solution can be found soon. As for the issue of the "conditions of surrender" in the past, it is expected to be put aside for the time being. The Arabic newspapers all carry the above outline and welcome it.

<h3>Situation in Jerusalem Remains Serious</h3>
<p>Strikes and Lockouts Intensify; Bloodshed Continues</p>
<p>Jerusalem Lieutenant Colonel Har-El and a British soldier were injured today while providing escort work near Tulkarem, forty miles north of here, when they were ambushed by mountain Arabs. A bomb exploded at a police station near Jaffa, injuring two civilians. No one in the station was injured. Three Christian Arabs were killed in Jaffa today. It is now believed that this was the result of a family dispute. The strike plan is now intensifying, so the seriousness of the situation cannot be considered to have eased. Many stores in Jaffa that had reopened, and several stores in Jerusalem that had opened, have now closed again due to pressure. Street vendors are also unable to do business safely. In addition to being beaten, the fruits they sell are also doused with gasoline. The resurgence of the riots is now believed to be due to telegrams of encouragement received by the Arab delegation in London. At the same time, the British authorities are now implementing more stringent plans to stop the smuggling of weapons. Heavy guards are stationed at the border and other places. A British destroyer patrols the coast at night, stopping and searching any suspicious ships. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Reviews Income Tax Bill</h3>
<p>Referred Back to Two Committees for Review The Bill Has Been Amended and Passed The Yuan Session Will Reconvene on the 9th to Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After passing routine motions at the meeting on the 7th, the Legislative Yuan reviewed the report of the Finance Committee on the examination of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations Bill. The committees had heated debates on the tax rates and collection methods of the regulations. After the chairman's vote, the bill was referred back to the Finance Committee to be jointly reviewed by the Economic Committee and five committee members: Luo Ding, Yang Gongda, Cheng Zhonghang, Lin Bin, and Lu Zhiyi. A special Yuan session was scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 PM on the 9th for review. At the beginning of the review of the bill, Chen Changheng reported on the review process, stating that China's central tax system has always emphasized indirect taxes, and the people feel that the burden is uneven. Direct taxes should be gradually reformed. The decision of the Central Political Committee to establish the principle of income tax has been thoroughly researched. However, because the income tax is similar in nature to the income donation collected by the central government, it has not been implemented for fear of double taxation. Now, because the cultural education expenses that rely on income donation revenue have been transferred to the national treasury for expenditure in the national budget for the 25th year, the central government has agreed to suspend the income donation. Therefore, it has been decided to levy income tax. The draft income tax regulations bill originally proposed by the Ministry of Finance only collected taxes on two types of income: business profit income and salary and remuneration income, estimated at 5 million yuan. The Finance Special Committee of the Central Political Committee expanded its scope of collection, adding a type of income: securities deposit income. Based on this type of tax revenue alone, it should be more than 15 million yuan. The total tax revenue from the three types is estimated to be at least 25 million to 30 million yuan per year. As for agricultural income and land and property income, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the excessive burden on farmers, and because housing donations are already being collected, and land value tax and value-added tax will be levied in the future, they are not included in order to avoid increasing the burden on farmers. Subsequently, the three types of tax rates, tax-free scope, and collection methods in the bill were explained one by one. Liu Zhendong then provided a supplementary report, stating that this bill has been repeatedly studied by the Ministry of Finance, the Finance Special Committee of the Central Political Committee, and experts and scholars, and the following eight principles have been determined: The first type of business profit income is different from other countries in that it uses total income as the standard for taxation. Because China's commercial accounting system has not yet been established, it cannot use net income as the basis for taxation. The second type of salary and remuneration income is heavier than in other countries, but lighter than the current income tax rate. The third type of securities deposit income is to prevent capital flight and deposit accounts from being broken down into smaller amounts, so a progressive system is not adopted, but a common tax rate is set. Finally, it was stated that the tax proposed is new, so the scope is small and the tax rate is low. Cheng Zhonghang said that the tax rate in the Finance Committee's review amendment seems heavier than the one stipulated in the original draft sent by the Ministry of Finance. Is this a special favor from the Ministry of Finance, or is it increasing the burden on the people? The Finance Committee should be asked to explain further. Liu replied that the Finance Committee's review amendment is based on the draft recently sent informally by the Ministry of Finance's Tax Department. The tax rates are all advocated by the Ministry of Finance, not the Finance Committee itself. Chen Guyuan said that this bill should be discussed after the Ministry of Finance sends the official draft to the Yuan. Zhang Zhihan said that the content of this bill still needs to be considered and advocated referring it back for review. Yang Gongda said that the consistent spirit of the Legislative Yuan is to speak from the perspective of the people, and this bill seems to increase the burden on the people. He advocated delaying the discussion. Luo Ding and Lu Zhiyi said that the bill taxes total income without deducting the necessary living expenses of the people, which is unfair. They also advocated referring it back for review. Lin Bin said that there are loopholes in the bill that cause double taxation of the three types of income and seconded the motion to refer it back for review. Although Chen and Liu separately answered the dissenting opinions of the committees, they were outnumbered due to the disparity in power. In addition, Xiao Shuyu, Di Ying, Shi Weihuan, and Wei Tingsheng of the Finance Committee itself were also dissatisfied with the opinions of Chen and Liu. When the chairman put the motion to refer the bill back for review to a vote, it was passed by a vote of 48 to 15. As a result, the chairman designated the Finance and Economic Committees to jointly review the bill with five committee members, Luo Ding, et al. Ma Yinchu convened the meeting and proposed that it be discussed again on the 9th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, convened a joint meeting of all members of the Finance and Economic Committees and five committee members, Lin Bin, Luo Ding, Lu Zhiyi, Cheng Zhonghang, and Yang Gongda, on the afternoon of the 7th to re-examine the Income Tax Bill. The Ministry of Finance sent Zou Lin, Gao Bingfang, and Liang Jingchun to attend the meeting. Chairman Ma Yinchu passed the amendment to the bill. The number of chapters and articles remained the same. It will be submitted to the special Yuan session on the afternoon of the 9th for review. The main points of the amendment are as follows: The first type of business profit income, which was originally calculated based on the total income as the standard for taxation, is now changed to taxation based on net income. The starting point for taxation of the first type of income, section four, is that income that is 5% to less than 10% of the actual amount of capital will be taxed at 30 per mille. The second type of salary and remuneration income will include the salaries of elementary school teachers in the tax-free scope. In the tax rates for the second type of income, the amount of monthly average income from 31 yuan to 60 yuan will be taxed at 5 fen for every 10 yuan, and the amount from 61 yuan to 100 yuan will be taxed at 1 jiao for every 10 yuan. The rest will remain the same. The third type of securities deposit income will be taxed at a uniform rate of 50 per mille of the income. Foreigners in China will also have to pay income tax according to the law. (Central News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The draft of the Income Tax Law was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion at the meeting on the 7th. Because most committee members believed that the tax rate was too high, it was decided to refer it back for review. A review meeting was held in the afternoon. Zou Lin, Gao Bingfang, Liang Jing, and others from the Ministry of Finance all attended the meeting to explain the process. It took four hours to complete the review of all the articles. It will be submitted to the General Assembly on the 9th for approval. According to Ma Yinchu, the draft Income Tax Law has been decided to be changed back to the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. It has been reviewed today. The important points of the changes to the original draft are: 1. The original profit income was calculated based on the total amount of profit for taxation, and expenses, etc., were not deducted, which seemed unfair. Therefore, it was revised to calculate taxation based on the net amount of profit. 2. It was decided to add a tax exemption for the salaries of elementary school teachers. Secondary and university teachers will still be taxed. 3. The salaries (from 30 yuan to 60 yuan) will be reduced to a tax of 5 fen for every 10 yuan (originally scheduled to be taxed at 1 jiao). 4. The item (taxing 30 per cent of income that is less than 5 per cent of the total capital) has been deleted to reduce the burden on small businesses. 5. The tax rate to be levied on securities interest income was originally set at 70 per mille, but after review, it was reduced to 50 per mille. These five points of revision were all decided after detailed discussion. As for foreigners in China, it was decided that they will be taxed in the same way. (Special dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Qingdao) Lieutenant General Sakanishi of the Japanese House of Peers arrived in Qingdao by plane on the 7th and then flew to Tianjin. (Special dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Colonel Honda, the China Section Chief of the General Staff Department who is inspecting China, arrived in Qingdao from Jinan at 10 PM last night. He met with the press corps at 11:30 AM this morning and made a statement saying, "I have been away from Tokyo since I departed on the 17th of last month, and more than two weeks have passed. There must have been considerable changes in the meantime, so today I can only make a personal travel talk as Honda. I will explain it in four items as follows: 1. People engaged in commerce centering on Qingdao are extremely difficult due to the impact of low tariffs. I express my sympathy for this. In order to alleviate this difficulty, I believe that various jobs are necessary. 2. Regarding the Mao Yi Maru incident, Consul General Nishida and this province are maintaining close contact and handling it well. 3. The general situation in North China has recently encountered one or two problems, but it will not become a major event. It is not impossible to conclude that North China will gradually become clear. Although there are occasional attempts by some ronin to instigate misunderstandings, because the Tianjin Garrison is now adopting a stern attitude and a firm policy, there is no room for reckless actions. 4. Regardless of the central government, each overseas agency is working hard for the development of the country and the nation. This is a very good sign. I sincerely hope that all overseas Chinese will trust the authorities' measures and refrain from rash actions." (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Trade of the Kwantung Leased Territory and the Smuggling Problem in North China</h3>
<p>Sugar and Silk are not all absorbed by the Puppet Manchukuo. Indexes of Exports and Imports Deserve Attention</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao's Dalian correspondent reported on June 30th, "The Kwantung Government recently released statistics on foreign trade in the Kwantung Leased Territory, with some noteworthy points. The figures are divided into two columns, one for April of this year and one for January to April of this year. In April, exports increased by 31.5% compared to March, and imports increased by 9.1%. Compared with April of last year, exports in April of this year increased by 93%, and exports decreased by 6.4%. This is because smuggling in North China in April of last year was not as rampant as it is this year. The Japanese claim that goods transshipped from the Kwantung Leased Territory to North China cannot be regarded as smuggled goods. Even if this is credible, it is impossible not to relate the recent prosperity of the Jidong market to the expansion of export trade in the Kwantung Leased Territory. However, it is still interesting to analyze these statistics with timely considerations. Now, let us focus on sugar and silk (although rayon is not specifically marked, it is largely included in the silk category). It should be known that neither of these two items is produced locally, and the Puppet Manchukuo relies entirely on Japanese supply. Therefore, the following indexes of exports and imports deserve special attention, especially the export figures. In the first four months of this year, the Kwantung Leased Territory imported sugar worth 10,853,000 Japanese yen and exported sugar worth 5,229,000 yen, accounting for about half of the imports. This is, of course, the largest transaction for re-exporters. The largest transaction was in April, with imports valued at 4,010,000 yen and exports valued at 3,318,000 yen. Therefore, only 692,000 yen worth of sugar remained for local consumption and storage.</p>
<p>The total number of rayon exports and imports is not mentioned. This is clearly listed in the silk category. Moreover, the Kwantung Leased Territory is a very prosperous place for rayon sales. This is well known. It is now said that the rayon smuggled goods stored in North China are shipped from Dalian. Therefore, it is undoubtedly included in the silk category. Most of the silk imported here seems to be re-exported. In the first four months of this year, silk worth 6,104,000 Japanese yen was imported, and silk worth 5,087,000 yen was exported. Therefore, only 1,017,000 yen remained for local consumption and storage. Most of the silk was exported in April, worth 3,546,000 yen, which is more than double the 1,714,000 yen imported that month. The statistics certainly do not specify the destination of the exported goods. However, in April of this year, the Puppet Manchukuo purchased goods worth 1,061,000 yen from the Kwantung Leased Territory. China purchased goods worth 10,131,000 yen. The Puppet Manchukuo's purchases this month largely included various goods, so the sugar and silk exported from the Kwantung Leased Territory were certainly not all absorbed by the Puppet Manchukuo."</p>
<h3>Ambition of the Japanese Textile Industry: Expanding Yarn Factories in China</h3>
<p>Decided to Take Tianjin as the Center, Expanding by 330,000 Spindles, Aiming to Seize the Entire Chinese Cotton Yarn Industry</p>
<p>A Tianjin correspondent reports that the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) office in Tianjin has been investigating North China's economy, and most of the work has already been completed. Recently, the North China Economic Development issue, jointly discussed by the Japanese Foreign, Colonial, Agriculture and Forestry, and Army Ministries, has come to the fore. Ambassador Kawagoe brought a plan and will explicitly negotiate with our side, so the work has become tense again. The director of the office, Masao Ota, went to Dalian last week to listen to the instructions of the President of Mantetsu, Matsuoka. He returned to Tianjin a few days ago. At the same time, 30 talented employees of the Economic Department's investigation section of Mantetsu's head office were dispatched to Tianjin within the next week to listen to Ota's command and engage in work, still focusing on mines and cotton production. The North China Economic Survey Group, recently initiated by the Japanese Foreign, Colonial, Agriculture and Forestry, and Army Ministries and organized by Japanese business authorities such as Okura, Mitsubishi, and Mitsui, will have a total of 200 people, including various experts in Japan. They plan to come to Tianjin via Northeast China around July 15th, and conduct surveys of mines, cotton production, waterworks, transportation, and other categories, with Tianjin and Beiping as the center of their activities. All the members of the group will be divided into eight groups in order to proceed quickly. The survey period is scheduled for five weeks to two months. This and the Mantetsu's 담당者 have a corresponding role. After the Tianjin Yarn Factory Yuyuan was sold to the Japanese Kanebo Company in May, the machines are being refitted. Kanebo sent a Japanese named Fukunaga as manager, and it was renamed Yufeng First Branch (Yufeng First Branch is in Shanghai). In addition to the original 70,000 spindles, land in Xiaoliuzhuang was purchased, and construction of the Third Branch is planned to begin in April of next year, with a capacity of 70,000 spindles and 1,000 looms. 2,500 Chinese workers and 1,000 Japanese male and female workers will be hired. Three years later, Xiaoliuzhuang will become an industrial area for Japanese living in China. The new yarn factory planned by Toyo Textile Company in Special Area Four will initially have 50,000 spindles, and will continue to expand in the second and third phases, adding 100,000 spindles within two years. The Yuda Yarn Factory, originally operated by Japanese in Tianjin, has 20,000 spindles, and is now supported by the Dai Nippon Spinning Company, which will expand it to 40,000 spindles. Therefore, three years later, in Tianjin alone, Japanese yarn factories will have 300,000 spindles, totaling nearly 35% of all the spindles owned by state-run yarn factories. The Japanese intend to use the aforementioned factories as a base of activity, so that Tianjin will become the center of Japanese yarn sales in the future, supplying markets in South China, North China, and the puppet Manchukuo, and then monopolizing the entire Chinese yarn industry. Each yarn factory will also focus on fine yarn that our country cannot spin. Japanese merchants will also use diplomatic power to obtain preferential treatment from our government for transporting cotton yarn. Therefore, the Japanese yarn industry is very optimistic about future business, but our country's textile industry in Tianjin is worried about it.</p>
<p>The North China wool weaving industry is also being noticed by the Japanese, who are making every effort to develop it. The plan for the Manchuria-Mongolia Wool Weaving Company to set up factories in Zhangjiakou and Tianjin has recently become more concrete. It is said that its purpose is to buy wool, sort it locally, and then divide it into several types, and use cheap wages in North China to build large-scale textile factories in Zhangjiakou and Tianjin to produce wool, wool blankets, and other wool products. The North China wool weaving market is still in British hands. The Japanese plan to completely replace it within five years, and it can be asserted that British wool products will automatically stop shipping because they will be boycotted. (5th)</p>
<h3>Agricultural Warehouse Mortgage Loan in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Loan Amount Limited to 1 Million Yuan, Monthly Interest Rate of 8.5 Per Mille, Calculated Daily</p>
<p>Anqing correspondence: The warehousing and mortgage funds needed by provincial and county agricultural warehouses were previously agreed by the Chinese Farmers Bank, the Bank of China, and the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate to be loaned, with staff from the Provincial Government present. The Agricultural Warehouse Management Office drafted nine principles for loans from each bank to agricultural warehouses, which were submitted to and passed by the Provincial Government Standing Committee, and staff were sent to each bank to continue negotiating loan contracts. The terms and conditions of the agricultural warehouse mortgage loan contract concluded between the Management Office and the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Bank are copied below.</p>
<p>The Management Office sends a formal letter of introduction for the agricultural warehouses under its guidance and organization that need warehousing and mortgage funds for handling warehousing and mortgage loans, and the syndicate will approve the loan only after review. The total amount of the loan is temporarily limited to 1 million yuan, and will be increased as appropriate when the agricultural warehouse business develops. The interest rate on the loan is set at 8.5 per mille per month, calculated daily. The term of the loan is from the date of signing the contract to March 31, 1937, and the principal and interest must be settled in full upon expiration. The investment area of the loan is 24 counties including Fengyang, Nanling, Chaoxian, Wuwei, Wuhe, Lingbi, Qimen, Shitai, Yixian, Jingsui, Xixi, Shexian, Langxi, Guangde, Ningguo, Jingxian, Taiping, Qingyang, Guichi, Tianchang, Quanjiao, Boxian, Fuyang, and Yingshang, with 8 provincial warehouses and 50 county warehouses. The loan is specifically for the funds required by the agricultural warehouses listed in the preceding article for warehousing and mortgage business, and may not be used for any other purpose. The measures for agricultural warehouse mortgage loans shall be formulated by the Management Office and the syndicate. The syndicate allows each agricultural warehouse to overdraw 3,000 yuan for the provincial warehouse and 2,000 yuan for the county warehouse for the convenience of loan at the beginning of the business. The syndicate's investment in mortgage loans is based on the agricultural warehouse mortgage certificate, and the agricultural products mortgaged by farmers are used as collateral at 70% of the current price. The agricultural products mortgaged by each agricultural warehouse are used as the first guarantee for the syndicate's loan, and the Management Office is the responsible guarantor for repayment. If there is a mortgage certificate but no collateral is found, the Management shall be fully responsible. If agricultural warehouses that have been loaned mortgage funds by the syndicate handle the transportation and sales of agricultural products, the syndicate shall undertake the mortgage negotiation. The syndicate's investment in mortgage loans to each agricultural warehouse shall be for a maximum of ten months, but shall not exceed the period stipulated in Article 4 of this contract. The syndicate has the right to audit the business and review the accounts of the loaned agricultural warehouses. The syndicate recommends four auditors, who are commissioned by the Management Office, and their salaries and travel expenses are borne by the Management Office. Any matters not covered in this contract may be amended jointly by both parties. This contract shall be made in duplicate, with the Management Office and the syndicate each holding one copy for good faith. This contract shall be submitted by the Management Office to the Anhui Provincial Government for approval and implementation, and shall become effective after both parties formally sign it.

<h3>Recent Construction in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Central District Expands Rural Center Organization, Department of Education Plans to Establish Provincial Museum</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Fan Dexing, Pacification Commissioner of the Central District of Guangdong Province, in order to relieve unemployed farmers and develop the rural economy, established a Central Rural Experiment Zone in the Yuxia area under Panyu County some years ago. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. Now, in order to expand this central rural initiative and relieve unemployed people, it has been decided to establish central rural cooperatives in counties with sandy fields. Loans will be borrowed from banks and lent to farmers for cultivation. Personnel have been assigned to prepare for this matter, and it will be implemented soon. According to Commissioner Fan, the establishment of central rural areas in various counties to recruit farmers for cultivation will not only relieve the general unemployed population and increase various types of production, but also take the opportunity to promote rural education and maintain local security. This measure is indeed urgently needed.</p>
<p>The provincial government recently decided to establish a provincial museum to promote cultural construction and increase public knowledge. The planning of the museum was instructed to the Department of Education long ago. According to the Department of Education, the department has drafted an estimate of the start-up costs and preparatory period expenses, and has submitted it to the provincial government for review and approval. Once approved, the department will first hire social celebrities and educational experts as members of the museum's preparatory committee to establish a preparatory committee and begin work. It is expected that the museum will be completed within the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936].</p>
<h3>Price Competition Among Yangtze River Steamers</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: There are five commercial shipping companies operating on the Yangtze River, including the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the privately-run Sanbei Company, as well as the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, and the Japanese Nisshin. These companies operate over thirty steamers, sailing upstream and downstream between Shanghai and Hankou, passing through various commercial ports such as Nanjing, Wuhu, and Jiujiang, all fully loaded with passengers and cargo, and their business is booming. However, since the completion of the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway and Highway by the Wuhu Jiangnan Railway Company and the Anhui Construction Department, and the joint passenger and freight transport service with the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, which is fast and convenient, far surpassing the Yangtze River shipping, Wuhu, conveniently located in the middle of the Yangtze River and historically known as "Central River", the business of the Yangtze River steamers downstream has gradually declined due to the evolution of the times. Competition for survival has become an inevitable trend. China Merchants Sanbei took the lead in eliminating malpractices and adopting new transport methods to make passengers feel less weary during their journey, and their business has shown signs of revitalization. Affected by this, foreign shipping companies have recently increased the sale of fourth-class tickets for poor passengers. The fare from Wuhu to Hankou is 1.7 yuan, and the fare from Wuhu to Shanghai is only 1.2 yuan in order to compete with land transportation. In addition to reducing fares, Nisshin's ships have also used various methods to attract passengers and offer small favors to entice the poor and ignorant. As a result, the number of passengers has increased significantly. Taikoo, due to the need to send the Wenzhou and Yifeng steamers to Shanghai for repairs, has specially dispatched the Wanliu, Wantong, and Jintang steamers to join the Yangtze River service. The Wanliu has already decided to set sail from Shanghai, fully loaded with passengers and cargo, passing through Wuhu and heading upstream.</p>

<h3>River Dredging Project Completed</h3>
<p>The County Construction Bureau's river dredging project for the 24th year originally planned to dredge 14 river channels, which was approved by the provincial department. Later, due to special circumstances in various districts, they were unable to provide labor, so dredging was selectively carried out. A total of nine river channels were dredged, including the Xin'an Creek in the Third District, the Xin Duqiao market river in the Fourth District, Cai Tingqiao Port, the Sitou River in the Fifth District, the Houshu River in the Sixth District, the Panxu Port and Xuchongqiao Port in the Seventh District, and the Bei Qifang Ham in the Ninth District, totaling 26 kilometers in length and 92,000 cubic meters of earth excavated. The project has now been fully completed, costing more than 7,200 yuan for dam construction, water lifting, and other expenses. Yesterday, Director Zhang telegraphed the provincial department, requesting that a commissioner be sent to Wuxi for acceptance inspection. There are still five river channels that have not been dredged, which will be carried out in next year's plan.</p>
<h3>Haizhou Grain Prices Gradually Soaring</h3>
<p>Since the lifting of the ban on grain exports in this county, all the unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of the opportunity of the new wheat harvest to borrow money from banks, buy up large quantities of grain for hoarding, and ship them by train and ship to Dalian, Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, Yantai, and other ports for sale, making a considerable profit. As a result, grain prices in Xinpu have soared recently, with wheat selling for around 1.7 or 1.8 yuan per dou (unit of dry measure) in national currency. Poor residents are crying out in misery, and there is great panic about the problem of livelihood.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Chamber of Commerce Plans to Form Anti-Smuggling Association</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Chamber of Commerce held a routine meeting on the 6th and resolved to nominate Zhu Lizun to attend a meeting convened by the Jiangdu County Party Department to prepare for the prevention of smuggling. It also resolved to follow the order of the Jiangdu County Government to distribute a compilation of laws and regulations on tax evasion and set a date to convene a meeting of the Executive Committee to discuss the organization of an anti-smuggling committee.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou-Jingjiang Road Fully Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>Regarding the opening of the Yangzhou-Jingjiang road, the Jiangsu Construction Department Highway Office had previously opened the section from Yangzhou to Xiannvmiao and the section from Kouan to Taixing for trial traffic. Now, the entire roadbed, from Yangzhou to Jingjiang Bawei, has been completed and is open to passenger vehicles on the 6th. However, the road surface is still dirt, and traffic will be suspended whenever it rains. After the road surface is further improved, normal traffic can resume.</p>
<h3>Pinghu Two Apprentices Steal Money to Learn Immortality</h3>
<p>Apprentice A of a butcher shop on Ganhe Street in the city secretly instructed a flower shop apprentice named Mou Guan from Xiao Jie Gan Qiaoyuan to steal money from his master and run away together to learn immortality. Mou Guan sneaked into the mistress's upstairs room, pried open a box, stole 100 yuan in banknotes, and fled. After the mistress discovered this, she entrusted someone to search for them everywhere. Later, at the Shanghai port, they saw the two buying tickets and immediately arrested them and escorted them back.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Tung Oil and Tangerine Loans</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department, in order to improve the production and development and sales of tung oil in eastern Zhejiang counties, specially sent Hezuo Baoquan and Tang Xunze to Shanghai to negotiate tung oil loans with the Shanghai Commercial Bank. They returned to Hangzhou yesterday. The principle decided is to concentrate tung seeds for oil extraction and cooperative sales. The first step is to order cooperative societies and cooperative federations in various tung oil producing areas to organize production and mortgage financing by the bank for 500,000 yuan, which will be transferred from Shanghai to the county farmers' banks for lending to cooperative societies. The Construction Department plans to convene farmers' banks from various counties to Hangzhou to discuss loan procedures and methods. As for improving the concentrated packaging and sales of Huangyan tangerines, various banks are willing to invest 100,000 yuan, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau will introduce them for sale abroad.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Dongdu Central Fire</h3>
<p>The Dajin Shoe Store at No. 10 Dongdu Road in this port, which is solely owned by Zhang Chuxing from Jiangshan, Yin County, was purchased for 8,000 yuan three years ago. It is a three-story, double-opening Western-style facade. At about 1 a.m. this morning, a fire broke out on the third floor. After Zhang discovered it, he immediately took his wife and children and woke up the apprentices to escape. It was extinguished after half an hour. The first and second floors and the facade were fortunately preserved. The store has fire insurance of 9,500 yuan, and the loss is estimated at 4,000 yuan. The neighboring Meili Xiang Clock Shop and Yun Zhang Silk Shop, although their buildings were unscathed, their goods were damaged by water.</p>
<h3>Bandit Party Resists Arrest and Engages in Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>The County Detective Team stationed in Andong, Yuyao, after the occurrence of the detective bandit incident, Detective Chief Hu Guichuan immediately led his men to the county to avoid their edge and arrest the rioters for investigation and punishment. Recently, three cases of kidnapping occurred in Zonghan Township within two days. County Magistrate Lin then ordered Hu Guichuan to return to Andong to investigate and arrest them. Unexpectedly, the rioters were aware of this and, due to deep-seated hatred, intended to retaliate. After investigating that they would definitely pass through Gao Wang Road, they gathered more than twenty bandits and ambushed them to wait. Hu Guichuan and more than ten detectives set off in two groups. Detectives Shao Mingcan and others returned to Andong via Gao Wang. When they arrived, the ambushers suddenly emerged, and the gunshots were like a continuous string of pearls. Shao and others immediately returned fire in self-defense. The disparity in numbers was too great, and the situation was extremely critical. Fortunately, the Tianyuan City Security Corps heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, and the siege was lifted. Both sides reported injuries. County Magistrate Lin, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the Linshan Security Corps to rush to encircle and suppress them.</p>
<h3>A Pleasant Anecdote of the Southern Tour</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying of this newspaper</p>
<p>Impressions of West Lake</p>
<p>The beauty of the scenery of West Lake in Hangzhou, and the secludedness of its mountains, forests, springs, and rocks, have been the subject of countless poems and essays by literati since ancient times. The water, the pagoda, the broken bridge, and the ancient temples each possess a unique style that attracts people and inspires contemplation. Such a landscape is truly as Mr. Kang Youwei said, "Having traveled all over the four continents, I have never seen it."</p>
<p>This time, the reporter's southern tour passed through Hangzhou, and only made a partial visit to West Lake. I hired a small rowboat and first negotiated with the boatman about the places that could be visited in a day, which included Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Viewing Fish at Flower Harbor, Jingci Temple, Yue Fei Temple, Lingyin Temple, Su Causeway, Huxin Pavilion, Gushan, Lin Bu's Tomb, Fanghe Pavilion, Qiu Jin's Tomb, and more than ten private estates. Other scenic spots such as Feilai Peak, Wuyun Mountain, Longjing Mountain, and Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams are too numerous to mention, and even visiting for ten and a half months may not be enough to see everything. Therefore, I did not climb or visit them. In fact, visiting strange places and traveling mountains and rivers, the visual experience is certainly not shallow, but the mood can easily feel dull. Although there are many famous attractions that were not visited on this tour, I felt a sense of leisurely fascination and an image created by the heart, and did not feel regret.</p>
<p>Among the various scenic spots visited, several places left a deep impression and are worth mentioning in particular.</p>
<p>Walking to the northern end of the Su Causeway, with its "willows planted between peach trees", is the Yue Fei Temple at the north bank of Yuehu Lake, under Qixia Ridge. Its atmosphere of loyalty and heroism adds a lot of color to the lake and mountains. The temple's solemn and magnificent appearance surpasses all the ancestral halls and temples on the lake. The main hall enshrines the statue of Yue Fei, inscribed "Song Shao Bao Yue Zhongwu Wang" (Prince Yue of Zhongwu, the Junior Guardian of Song). The rear hall enshrines Yue Fei's parents, with Yue Fei's wife and daughter Yin Ping and son-in-law Zhang Xian, and also enshrines five sons and five daughters-in-law. Yue Fei's tomb is on the west side of the main hall, with Yue Yun buried next to him. There are no ancient cypresses as dense as those in the Confucius Forest, nor is there a tomb hall built in the style of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, but the feeling of solemn respect is still the same.</p>
<p>Among the trees at the tomb, there is a cypress tree that was split by lightning, and there is also a pavilion preserving several sections of "Petrified Cypress of Loyal Heart," which makes the sound of metal and stone when struck. It is said that the former is a symbol of the dismemberment of the traitor Qin Hui, and the latter is caused by the accumulation of Yue Fei's loyalty. During the Ming Dynasty, someone added bronze statues of Qin Hui, his wife, Wan Qihai, and Zhang Jun, tied up and kneeling dozens of steps away from the tomb platform. Now they have been replaced with iron statues because tourists constantly spit and curse them, or throw stones at them. The police have issued a prohibition, but it is still difficult to control. The sorrowful and dejected faces of those iron statues seem somewhat ridiculous and pitiful, but when I think back to the events when Qin Hui and his wife sat on a boat on the lake and colluded with the wax pill-selling spy Hami Shi to make a traitorous plan to the Jin people, I even want to hit them with stones, even though I know this is an unconscious act.</p>
<p>In Yue Wumu's hometown of Tangyin County, there is still a reliable story circulating. In the year after the Qing Dynasty fell, a new county magistrate went to Tangyin to take office. He hired a mule driver along the way to carry his luggage. It was winter, the nights were long and the days were short. Before arriving at the city, it got dark and they stayed at an inn. The county magistrate's attendant bought wine under the lamp and invited the mule driver to drink together. In the conversation, the mule driver asked about the county magistrate's surname. The attendant told him that his surname was Qin. The mule driver suddenly turned red in the face and asked urgently, "Is that the Qin of Qin Hui?" The attendant replied, "That's right!" The mule driver pushed away the table and chairs, stamped his feet and slammed the table, cursing, "Today, I, with the surname Yue, am working for the descendants of a traitor, I am truly blind!" After saying that, he turned around, took the mule, and left. The attendant could not catch up and directly told the county magistrate. The county magistrate was initially angry when he heard this, but after thinking about it, he was secretly amazed.</p>
<p>From this perspective, anyone who betrays national interests and is willing to be a clear or secret traitor not only creates iron statue qualifications for themselves, but also smears the faces of their descendants for generations. Contemporary traitors such as Yin Rugeng, Puyi, Zheng Xiaoxu, and "quasi-traitor" Xiao ×× and others, when they think about it in the quiet of the night, should be ashamed and sweating profusely. In that vast sea of suffering, please quickly turn back to avoid casting more iron statues in the future and further staining the jade-like color of West Lake.</p>
<p>The natural scenery of West Lake is inherently beautiful and lovely, combined with the songs of hermits and literati, and the embellishment of chivalrous and loyal souls, thus receiving an even more beautiful reputation. But people's psychology of pursuing and worshiping the spiritual decorations of West Lake, such as ancient tombs, famous ancestral halls, and bronze statues, roughly contains a progressive sense of the times. For example, from the Song to the early Yuan Dynasty, foreign forces expanded, the people suffered, and scholars who were keen on wealth and vanity still had to shamelessly ask their licentious superiors for official positions. Therefore, they felt that Lin Hejing, with his wife of plums and cranes, was commendable for his purity. At the same time, the Song Dynasty imperial family declined, and the Liao and Jin repeatedly launched large-scale invasions. The late Ming Dynasty was also threatened by the Manchu Qing, and both lacked capable generals to resist. Generals like those in Yue Fei's army and Yuan Chonghuan were successively framed by traitors, resulting in their premature deaths before their great ambitions were fulfilled. Therefore, it was felt that Yue Wumu, who sacrificed for loyalty and defending the country, was indeed a standard model soldier of a declining era, and deep respect was paid to him unintentionally. By the late Qing Dynasty, with the rise of revolutions in various places and the success of the Northern Expedition, the general gaze of worshiping martyrs shifted to Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin's chivalrous souls, and the buildings such as Chen Qimei's bronze statue and the Northern Expedition Martyrs Memorial Tower. Today, with the loss of the Northeast and the worsening situation in North China, tourists are moved by the scenery and feel a sense of reverie. Some still cannot help but recall Yue Wumu's military exploits to express the imagination of "returning our rivers and mountains", or even deduce Wumu's saying that "civil officials do not love money, and military generals are not afraid of death", believing that to adapt to the needs of the times, the spirit of "not loving money" and "not fearing death" should be possessed by both civil and military officials. Some ideals are more progressive, assuming that similar memorial buildings will be built in the future, they should not repeat the memorial towers of the Northern Expedition or the Southern Expedition, but should be great victory monuments of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of the oppressed people of the world.</p>
<p>On the lakeside is a private estate built by a Cantonese person. The magnificence of the buildings and the preciousness of the internal exhibits can probably rival those of other private estates. There is a family ancestral hall here, inscribed "Lake and Mountain Support," which can be said to be extremely grand. Outside the ancestral hall, a separate area is opened up as the cemetery for the estate owner and his nine wives. It is said that the estate owner had served as the prefect of Hangzhou during the Qing Dynasty, and has only been dead for two or three years. Among the wives, there are still some who have not died, only occupying empty tombs. In addition, there are three very young ones (twelve in total), one of whom is afraid of having an empty tomb, and two of whom have already "fled away." The altar, pond, and flowers and trees in the cemetery are so beautiful that even Yue Fei's tomb cannot compare. This is not to belittle Yue Fei's tomb, but to admire the estate owner's ability to make money while serving as the prefect, which is probably not weaker than what officials today call "doorway economics"!</p>
<p>The political center of gravity in Chinese history has mostly been in the north, in order to control Manchuria and Mongolia externally and rule Jiangnan internally. However, Jiangnan's abundant resources hold the lifeline of the economy. Since the Sui and Tang dynasties, the economic advantages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have gradually risen, forming an important economic center of China. The mountains and rivers of Suzhou and Hangzhou have both innate beauty and acquired superior economic background, adding embellishments and modifications, and have become a scenic area for high-level enjoyment. In fact, Hangzhou is known as a Buddhist land, with temples all over the mountains, attracting a wider range of people and a particularly high reputation. However, while many tourists happily chant the beautiful line "Above is heaven, below are Suzhou and Hangzhou," they should also remember the warning "Do not go to Xinjiang when old, do not visit Suzhou and Hangzhou when young." Looking at the political situation from the Eastern Han Dynasty to the Ming and Qing dynasties, has anyone who came to Jiangnan not been corrupted? The Qing Emperor Qianlong's southern tour was so lingering that he forgot to return. Emperor Yang of Sui built dragon boats and traveled to Yangzhou, until he lost his empire. In fact, the Southern Song Dynasty settled in Hangzhou, and during that period of one hundred and fifty-six years of partial security, their emperors and ministers still drove dragon boats every day, wandering on the lake, calling for palace women to sing and dance incessantly, indulging in pleasure. At that time, the patriotic writer Wen Jiweng's poems and lyrics, "Looking back at the flower world of Luoyang, the land of millet and separation is vast, and there is no more weeping at the New Pavilion. Clusters of happy red makeup shake painted boats, who are the ones who strike the oars in the middle of the river? The hatred of thousands of years, when will it be washed away?" were ignored, but Liu Yong's praising lines, "Three Autumn Cassia, Ten Mile Lotus Fragrance" aroused the ambition of Jin chief Wanyan Liang to "lead a million soldiers to West Lake and stand on the first peak of Wushan."</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the glamorous and soft beauty of West Lake can easily make people drunk, demoralized, and discouraged. But if people can deeply understand the seriousness of the national crisis and not be indulged by external temptations, the lake and mountains will have their own true colors. How can they be responsible for the loss of the country? Looking at King Goujian of Yue, who slept on firewood and tasted gall, he also rose from the beautiful landscape of Zhejiang to revive his country and seek revenge.</p>

<h3>Party and National Flag Promotion Committee Schedules Inspection of Flag Display</h3>
<p>The Party and National Flag Unification Promotion Committee of this city originally planned to complete the promotion work in the urban area by July 9 (National Revolutionary Army Swearing-in Anniversary) and set that day as the date for the general inspection. Since the beginning of the campaign, there have been many difficulties. After repeated publicity and guidance, the patriotic spirit of the citizens has been stimulated, so those who have recently purchased and prepared them have become increasingly enthusiastic. The committee, with the scheduled date approaching, has already sent letters to the various committee members yesterday to depart on that day and inspect in four districts to observe the achievements of the promotion in various places and the citizens' understanding of the Party and National Flag, in order to promote it and end it as soon as possible. Therefore, the promotion work in various places has been extremely tense recently. In addition to having already submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government to publish a notice in the newspaper, the committee also sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting that it be permitted to notify all branches and stations in accordance with the regulations on the manufacture and use of the Party and National Flag, and that the police be dispatched on that day to notify all shops to fly the flag in celebration, and to provide guidance and correction. If Party and National Flags that do not meet the regulations are found, they may be banned or confiscated. It is hoped that after this rectification, the use of the Party and National Flag in this city will be universally unified.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Bondholders' Group Opposes Railway Ministry's Measures</h3>
<p>Submitting requests to the Executive Yuan and Ministry for full payment of principal and interest; Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce sends telegram requesting remedial measures.</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Ministry of Railways, in order to settle the previous Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway bonds, has specifically allocated 800,000 yuan from the completed Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway loan as a one-time complete settlement. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Liquidation Office has announced that payments will begin on the 6th. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Bondholders' Group opposes this settlement by the Ministry of Railways, which involves repaying half the principal without interest, causing significant losses to the bondholders. The Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce has specifically telegraphed the Executive Yuan requesting remedial measures. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Bondholders' Group Announcement</p>
<p>In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan for relief, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Bondholders' Group issued a notice to all bondholders, stating: "On July 6th, newspapers in this city published announcements from the Ministry of Railways and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway Share Liquidation Office stating that overdue final-term bond payments for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway will be settled by allocating 800,000 yuan from the completed Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway loan, with a discounted one-time repayment. In short, this means repaying half the principal without interest. We are deeply shocked and dismayed. Bondholders purchased these bonds at face value with their hard-earned money, motivated by patriotism and support for the railway. Now, after eighteen years of overdue principal and interest, the accumulated interest has been lost, and the losses are already considerable. For over ten years, bondholders have sent numerous documents and telegrams, but they have been ignored. The nation's credit has been disregarded, and we are deeply saddened. Now, the legally acquired bonds and the owed funds are being repaid with half the principal and no interest, which is even more unjust. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Railway (now the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway) is generating substantial annual profits. The government profits, and employees receive bonuses, yet the long-overdue principal of the bondholders is being discounted and repaid without interest. We believe all bondholders will find this unacceptable. In addition to telegraphing the Executive Yuan for relief, requesting full payment of principal and interest, we are publishing this announcement to urge all bondholders to unite and advocate for their rights. We also hope that bondholders will postpone redeeming their bonds until full principal and interest are paid, to protect their rights. Deepest hopes." Correspondence address: Room 224, 4th Floor, 441 Hankou Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce Telegram</p>
<p>The Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce of this city telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, stating: "Today's newspaper reported the Ministry of Railways and the Zhejiang Railway Share Liquidation Office's announcement of a discounted repayment plan for overdue final-term share principal and interest and overdue principal and interest on Zhejiang Railway Company bonds. Bondholders Yang Qicheng, Wang Weide, Chen Shenxing, Jin Ruishi, and others came to the Chamber and stated that these stocks and bonds have been overdue for seventeen or eighteen years. According to the legal interest rate, bondholders' losses are already considerable. They hoped for interest to be paid and returned to alleviate their situation. Now, not only is there no interest, but only half of the original face value of the principal and interest is being repaid. The bondholders find this unacceptable, and the share liquidation was approved without consulting the bondholders, which is inappropriate. Please forward this and strongly advocate for a resolution. This case concerns not only credit but also the fact that the Zhejiang Railway has annual profits and substantial gains. These bondholders were key contributors to the initial establishment and maintenance of the railway. It is unfair and unreasonable to leave them with regret. We should remember the source when drinking water. We are reporting this situation and respectfully request you to quickly devise remedial measures to avoid leaving a weakness in the future history of railways." Respectfully, Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce, Yu.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Highway and Water Conservancy Expert Gu Sang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Return Home on the 11th to Report Back</p>
<p>Dr. Gu Sang, the League of Nations representative in China and expert in highways and water conservancy, was previously assigned to China with a term limit of June. Having reached the end of his term, he arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by special express train at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He is staying at the Duchen Hotel on Jiangxi Road and is scheduled to depart China for Europe on the French postal ship Felix Roussel on the 11th, to return to Geneva to report back. He is also scheduled to visit Mr. Song Ziwen, a standing member of the National Economic Council, to bid farewell. It is reported that since arriving in China at the end of last year, Mr. Gu has inspected the Yangtze River basin, South China, North China, and Northwest China, planning the development of highway and water conservancy construction for our country. He returned to Nanjing last month and has already prepared a report to be submitted to the National Economic Council for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Buying Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>Wheat, rapeseed, rice, and other grains have already been loaded for export; the quantity is still small, so the people's food supply is not expected to be affected.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Japanese merchants purchasing miscellaneous grains in our country, a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Gu Xinyi, a leader in the grain industry, yesterday and received detailed information, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Purchasing Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>Japanese merchants are purchasing rapeseed in Wuhu and shipping it to Japan for oil extraction. This is a normal occurrence because Japan lacks rapeseed and purchases it from our country every year. As for wheat, they have purchased over 20,000 dan in Wuhu and over 70,000 dan in Shanghai through the exchange, totaling 100,000 dan. At the same time, they have purchased 10,000 bags of rice in the interior, which have been shipped out one after another. It is said that the rice is being shipped to Dalian.</p>
<p>Small Quantity</p>
<p>Japanese merchants usually order wheat from abroad. This year, due to the pricing of foreign wheat, which is higher than our country's wheat, they have changed their policy and purchased it from our country. The quantity of wheat and rice purchased and shipped out is still small, so it is not expected to affect our country's food supply. If Japanese merchants were to purchase a large quantity, it would inevitably cause a shortage and panic in our country's food supply during this period of seasonal scarcity, and at the same time, it would raise the price of rice and other grains, which would affect the livelihood of our people.</p>
<h3>Kita Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Awaiting Kawagoe's Report After Returning to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: The Japanese Embassy's military attache, Kita Seiichi, went north to Tianjin on the 29th of last month to meet with Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese garrison in North China, and Tokuo Wataru, the second chief of the General Staff Headquarters, and then flew to Peiping and Chahar. After returning to Tianjin, he completed his mission and flew south from Tianjin on a China National Aviation Corporation plane at 1:00 PM yesterday. He arrived at Longhua Airport at around 6:00 PM. Utsunomiya, the military attache stationed in Shanghai, and others welcomed him. After disembarking, he returned to his official residence on Wuding Road to rest. He will meet with Ambassador Kawagoe after he returns to Shanghai today to report on his trip to the north. It is said that Lieutenant Colonel Takahashi, who accompanied Kita north, was originally scheduled to travel to Shanghai with Tokuo Wataru, but this was temporarily cancelled. It is said that he will come at a later date.</p>
<p>Military attache Kita returned to Shanghai from Tianjin by plane this afternoon and arrived at Longhua Airport at 6:00 PM. (7th, Dalian News Agency)</p>
<h3>Oikawa Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao</h3>
<p>Vice Admiral Oikawa, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet in China, inspected the deployment of his fleet in North China aboard the flagship Izumo last month. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai from Qingdao aboard the same ship and arrived in Shanghai at dawn yesterday.</p>
<h3>Flour Exchange Brokers Hold Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decide to Revise New Regulations</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: Due to the scarce supply of new wheat this year, the poor harvest in the United States, the improvement in the flour market in North China, and the purchase of flour by Japanese merchants, the price of flour has been rising frequently in recent days, and the trading volume has broken the highest record in recent years. The Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Social Affairs, concerned about the soaring flour prices and their impact on the people's food supply, specifically questioned the Flour Exchange, stating that the recent market situation has deviated from normal business practices and instructed the Exchange to automatically improve its business plan to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Gu's Advice</p>
<p>To avoid danger, the Exchange suspended trading again yesterday and convened an emergency meeting of all brokers in the afternoon. First, Mr. Gu Xinyi, the director of the Exchange, earnestly advised all brokers and offered the following suggestions: 1. Limit the price; the price on the 6th should be determined by a compromise method to balance the profits and losses of both buyers and sellers. 2. Stop trading in North China wheat immediately. 3. Advise bulls to sell to reduce the trading volume. 4. If there is no solution at the last minute, settle all prices. This measure is unfavorable to the Exchange, and it is best not to implement it. All brokers agreed with the principles of Gu's four suggestions.</p>
<p>Revise New Regulations</p>
<p>Then, the brokers exchanged opinions and discussed countermeasures. After deliberation, the following temporary measures were agreed upon: 1. It was decided to limit the maximum price; the prices for July, August, September, and March were set at 3.05 yuan, and 0.03 yuan was added to each month thereafter, i.e., 3.08 yuan for October, 3.11 yuan for November, and 3.14 yuan for December. 2. Stop new trading immediately. Both new regulations will be submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. According to inquiries made by reporters to the person in charge of the Exchange, rumors that the Exchange would add capital and change the chairman of the board are not true. After the new regulations are set, the market price can be stabilized, and there will be no more drastic changes that affect the people's food supply. Trading may resume as usual today, and the chaotic state of the market in recent days can be cleared away.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Issues Warning Letters to Residents and Shops Regarding Reporting Opium Smokers</h3>
<p>To urge landlords and shop managers to pay attention and report unregistered households and shop employees who smoke opium.</p>
<p>To urge landlords and shop managers to pay attention and report unregistered households and shop employees who smoke opium.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, in order to strictly report opium smokers and ensure comprehensive registration, has drafted measures for residents to sign pledges and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. The Bureau has also issued a type of warning letter to residents and shops to urge landlords and shop managers to pay attention and promptly report unregistered households, shop employees who smoke opium, unregistered opium smokers, and tenants or shop employees who transport and sell opium. The original text of the warning letter is recorded below: "The deadline for reporting opium smokers and registering in this city will be August 10th. After this deadline, opium smokers will no longer have the opportunity to register or voluntarily quit. The Bureau will strictly investigate and confiscate the hidden places of private opium smokers and drug offenders. Landlords and shop managers, if you discover that there are unregistered opium smokers, people who use strong drugs, or tenants or shop employees who secretly transport and sell opium in your co-residents or shops, you should quickly report them to the Bureau, the local police on duty, or submit a letter to the Bureau. If the report is found to be true, we will keep it strictly confidential and apply for a reward in accordance with the regulations. If you conceal the facts and fail to report, you will be held jointly liable if you are discovered in the future. It will be too late to regret it then. We hope that citizens will quickly realize this responsibility and actively report. This is a special warning."</p>

<h3>Eurasia's New Aircraft Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Having Flown Over India and Continuing Eastward</p>
<p>Eurasia Aviation Corporation leased a large three-engine aircraft from German Lufthansa. The corporation sent pilot Lu Sui to Germany to fly it to China. After departing Berlin on the 3rd, the weather along the way has been good and there have been no obstacles. A telegram received yesterday stated that the aircraft flew over the Arabian Sea the night before and arrived in India. It continued eastward this morning and may stop in Calcutta before crossing the Bay of Bengal and heading to Rangoon. After passing through Hanoi in Annam and Hong Kong, it will arrive in Shanghai. If there are no obstacles along the way, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sericulture and Silk Textile Committee Controls Summer Cocoon Prices</h3>
<p>Borrowing Money to Purchase and Reel Over 7,000 Dan of Cocoon Silk for Overseas Sales Through the Sales Promotion Committee</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Sericulture and Silk Textile Committee borrowed 5 million yuan from the Bank of China and Bank of Communications to purchase spring cocoons. The Cocoon Purchasing Committee purchased 110,000 dan (market weight) of improved breed fresh cocoons, equivalent to 30,000 dan (Sima weight) of dried cocoons. The Silk Reeling Committee handed these over to Hangzhou Silk Mill No. 1, Jiaxing Weicheng Silk Mill, and Tangxi Chongyu Silk Mill for reeling, totaling over 7,200 dan of silk. The Sales Promotion Committee is responsible for selling the silk and has already released futures. Over 70 or 80 dan have already been delivered. The current price of Chinese silk in the European and American markets is 650 yuan (Chinese currency) for 20-22 denier silk, slightly higher than when the cocoons were purchased. The Zhejiang Sericulture and Silk Textile Committee has decided to continue controlling summer cocoons. In addition to registering manufacturers who purchase and reel silk, they have also set standard prices for summer cocoons. It has been stipulated that for improved breeds, based on the Sima weight conversion of fresh cocoons at 600 jin (market weight) per reel, the price is 21.11 yuan. For native breeds, based on the Sima weight conversion of fresh cocoons at 660 jin (market weight) per reel, the price is 16.97 yuan. All cocoon merchants who purchase summer cocoons must follow these standard prices.</p>
<h3>Office of the China Aviation Association Shanghai Corps Commander Holds 66th Office Meeting</h3>
<p>The Office of the China Aviation Association Shanghai Municipal Micro-Request Corps Commander held its 66th Office Meeting at its office at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 6th) to discuss the fundraising progress and direction. Attendees included Chief Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhu Shengyang, Liu Songtao, Chen Shuo, Li Jiming, Song Zheng, Huang Jun, Gu Shangrui, Li Huiran, Zhang Peihu, Lu Zhangyan, and Wei Jianxin. The meeting was chaired by Li Dachao and recorded by Chen Shuo. The chairman reported that the fundraising efforts to purchase aircraft for birthday congratulations have been promoted diligently by all sectors and organizations in Shanghai, and the results are excellent. The Association previously dispatched special personnel to various important organizations to discuss and facilitate progress, in order to improve the performance of each organization and complete their mission as soon as possible. The progress has been very smooth, and results are being reported and submitted successively. In order to concentrate efforts and promote publicity, a meeting was convened on the 4th with all the ward chiefs in the city to discuss the fundraising efforts for purchasing aircraft for birthday congratulations. The ward chiefs from each district enthusiastically participated, demonstrating the citizens' support for expanding the aviation patriotism movement and their love for the leader. It was resolved that each ward chief would receive a triplicate receipt book to solicit donations from relevant parties, with a minimum of 50 yuan per person, for a period of two months, starting on July 15th. Many people took receipt books after the meeting. Those who did not attend that day have been notified separately and all district property owners have been notified to actively donate and contribute to the fundraising effort for purchasing aircraft for birthday congratulations to facilitate progress. The income from the summer entertainment horse races held by the Shanghai Race Club at Yinxinggang will be transferred as a donation. Mr. Du Yuesheng and the club's enthusiastic support are deeply appreciated. Unfortunately, the results were not satisfactory due to the rain that day. The club has expressed its intention to hold another day, which shows their enthusiasm.

<h3>Yunnan Sanyi Plant Oil Refinery Requests</h3>
<p>Joining the China Plant Oil Factory</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Directs Preparatory Office to Deliberate Carefully</p>
<p>Yunnan Province is located in a remote border region with difficult transportation, but the province's rich products have long been known to the world. The province's agricultural products, in addition to rice, include soybeans, grape seeds, rapeseed, tobacco seeds, perilla seeds, and other seed materials, which are the most common raw materials for oil extraction. Other trees, such as tung trees, lacquer trees, and Toona sinensis trees, are nearly everywhere in the areas of Qiaojia, Yiliang, Yongshan, and Zhenxiong in eastern Yunnan. Taking tung seeds as an example, the oil extracted each year, in addition to being used as fuel, is transported out from Bijie, Yongning, and Yibin in quantities of hundreds of thousands of catties. However, the traditional methods of production are used, with impurities mixed in, incomplete refining, and impure quality and color. There is no standard for refining, which has a significant impact on health, food, industrial products, and other uses. The authorities have not paid attention, and the people have not improved. Therefore, local business leaders raised capital of 500,000 Yunnan dollars in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic (1929-1930) to establish the Sanyi Plant Oil Refinery Co., Ltd. They purchased three mu of land on the east bank of the Desheng Bridge River and built Western-style factory buildings. They ordered a complete set of new-style 16-horsepower knife pressing oil extraction machines from the French Olier Factory, including four oil pressing machines, oil filtering machines, seed crushing machines, and seed roasting machines, as well as a steam boiler, an electric generator, and oil storage tanks and warehouses. The scale is grand. The equipment was completed in October of that year and oil extraction began. The factory can process 1,600 catties of seeds and produce 500 catties of pure oil in 10 hours of work per day. The products include "Caiflower Brand" red seed oil (i.e., grape seed and black seed oil, i.e., rapeseed), raw oil, and white seed oil (i.e., tobacco seed oil). Plans have also been made to process tung seeds from Qiaojia counties when the highway is completed and transportation becomes convenient this winter. Since the sale of the above products, they have been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. They are considered the best hygienic product for vegetarians and are happily purchased. Supply cannot meet demand. The Yunnan Product Appraisal Conference awarded the factory a special award certificate, and the Yunnan Construction Department and the Municipal Government registered and approved the factory to be tax-exempt. Recently, the factory heard that the Ministry of Industry, together with Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces, is initiating the organization of a China Plant Oil Factory, and it strongly agrees. Therefore, it specifically submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry, requesting the dispatch of personnel to the Yunnan factory for inspection and takeover, converting it into a branch factory, or adding equity capital for joint government-business operation. The Ministry of Industry has instructed the preparatory office of the China Plant Oil Factory to deliberate carefully on the cooperation methods.</p>

<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission Releases Report on Emergency Relief in Western Shandong by Delegation of the Red Cross Society</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road was previously entrusted by the China Red Cross Society to distribute emergency relief in the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, and Jiangsu. The distribution situation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangsu has been recorded in previous reports. Now, we record the report of Mr. Ji Luyi, the distribution staff in Western Shandong: "Luyi was honored to be appointed by the General Association to distribute the funds for the Red Cross Society’s Western Shandong relief, including 10,000 yuan, 2,000 bags of flour, five boxes of medicine, and 21 bundles of large and small clothing, hats, and shoes. In order to know the actual situation in the disaster area in advance, before the distribution, twelve people were dispatched to inspect more than 100 villages in the Wenshang and Jiaxiang area, so as to assess the situation. According to the report, the disaster area was flooded, the soil was loose, and transporting relief supplies was very difficult. Therefore, a relief distribution station was established in the urban area, and 2,000 flour relief tickets and 3,000 clothing relief tickets were distributed to the disaster victims, so that they could bring the tickets to exchange for the goods. At that time, there were many disaster victims suffering from diseases, and medical relief was very necessary. Therefore, 10,000 yuan of relief funds were transferred for medical treatment and medicine distribution, including 9,700 yuan to Jining Hospital and 300 yuan to Yanzhou Hospital. Over the past few months, there have been 4,500 people seeking treatment, and there are still more than 90 people hospitalized. This is the situation of the emergency relief distribution in Western Shandong."</p>

<h3>Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng's Judgment in the Case of Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>The case of bribery involving judges and lawyers in Shanghai's judicial circles, which caused a great stir, was reported to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The Ministry secretly ordered the Shanghai District Court Judge Tan Zhuohong and Lawyer Yang Shaopeng to be handed over to the Wuxian District Procuratorate for investigation. Prosecutor Zhu Shufen initiated a public prosecution for dereliction of duty. The Criminal Court President Yu Zhong and Judges Fang Duohuan and Chen Ziguan formed a collegial panel to conclude the trial. The judgment was made on the 25th of last month.</p>
<p>Main Text: Tan Zhuohong is sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years for jointly and continuously soliciting bribes from public officials for actions violating their duties. Yang Shaopeng is sentenced to six years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for eight years for jointly and continuously soliciting bribes from public officials for actions violating their duties. After hearing the judgment, both defendants expressed their dissatisfaction and prepared to appeal. The judgment, now delivered, is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Facts: Tan Zhuohong, serving as a judge in the Shanghai Local Court, and Yang Shaopeng, practicing law in Shanghai, colluded with each other to solicit bribes from parties involved in cases. On October 7, 1935, Tan Zhuohong accepted Zhang Qidong's private prosecution against Song Dacheng for defamation. On June 13, he handled the case of Qin Zhengru, the owner of the Haizhou Steamship Company, causing death by negligence. On September 9, he accepted Lei Yunsheng's lawsuit against Wang Bingnan for counterfeiting trademarks. On October 5, he handled Wu Peizhen's private prosecution against Li Keting for interfering with marriage. On June 28, he accepted Cheng Li Tianzhi's lawsuit against Xu Yi for counterfeiting documents. However, the Qin Zhengru case was mediated by Xi Hanchu, who entrusted Qi Yougen, a steward on the Zhida Steamship, to speak on his behalf. The rest were all handled by Yang Shaopeng, who contacted the parties involved one after another. Regarding the case of handling Wu Peizhen's private prosecution for interfering with marriage, which originally involved a spouse, and therefore could not be privately prosecuted, Tan still accepted it. Moreover, before soliciting a bribe, he detained the defendant Li Keting. In the case of Qin Zhengru causing death by negligence, he leaked the sentence before the judgment. In the case of Wang Bingnan counterfeiting trademarks, he disclosed all the details of the case due to soliciting a bribe. Later, after someone reported it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry secretly ordered the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court to investigate and respond. Tan Zhuohong, Yang Shaopeng, and others, along with all the case files, were handed over to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasoning: Whether the defendants Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng are guilty of the charges in this case should be determined based on whether there is criminal conduct. During the interrogation of Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng, both denied the fact of jointly soliciting bribes. However, the criminal conduct of the defendants is confirmed by the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the case of Zhang Qidong, Yang Dingchen, and others privately prosecuting Song Dazheng for defamation, witness Sun Zuji repeatedly testified, "The case was heard for the first time on October 14th of last year. On the 16th, Yang Shaopeng came to my office and said, 'Do you want to find a way to deal with your case? Judge Tan of the Local Court has asked me to contact you. He said that the defendant can be prosecuted, but the plaintiff must pay a considerable price.' I immediately refused and informed the parties involved. Fearing that Judge Tan might have prejudices, I withdrew the private prosecution." Zhang Qidong and others also stated, "The case was heard for the first time on October 14th of last year, and there have been no hearings since. I went to Lawyer Sun's office around October 20th. According to Lawyer Sun, Lawyer Yang Shaopeng came to discuss the case on the 16th of this month, saying that he was Judge Tan, who was handling our case in court, and he asked him to say that our evidence was very weak. If we wanted to prosecute the defendant, we had to pay a considerable price. We refused and said that the defendant had repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned. We requested a warrant for arrest according to the law, but it was not approved. Judge Tan also pointed out in court that the evidence was weak and spoke very harshly." This is consistent with the testimony of witness Chen Fengming, "On October 6th of last year, I went to Sun Zuji's office. Only he and Wang Jiecheng were there. Later, a person came, whose name I did not know at first. Later, Sun Zuji told me that it was Yang Shaopeng. Sun Zuji took out a business card and said, 'What a joke! What a joke!' I asked him what was the matter. He said that he was handling a very small case. The judge of the court asked him to say that the evidence was weak and that if he wanted to prosecute the defendant, he had to pay a considerable price." The statements made by Wang Jiecheng are also consistent. The business card that Sun Zuji submitted to the court, the statements of the witnesses, and the other witness reports mentioned match each other. The fact that defendants Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng solicited bribes for public officials' actions is provable, and their empty words and excuses cannot absolve them of their criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Qin Zhengru, the owner of Haizhou Steamship, causing death by negligence, defendant Tan Zhuohong denied colluding with Xi Hanchu to solicit bribes from the parties involved. However, Wu Zhiquan, the chief mate of Haizhou Steamship, stated, "After the court hearing, a steward on the Zhida Steamship named Qi Yougen came and said, 'Your case needs some money to be spent to avoid trouble. I know a Xi Hanchu. This Gong Hanchu has a relationship with the judge handling the case. He can find a way, and he can even invite the judge to eat together, but not at the same table.' I told Qin Zhengru about this, and he told me to ignore him. Not long after, Qi Yougen said to me again, 'If you don't spend money, the judge is going to sentence you to three years in prison, but it hasn't been announced yet. If you are willing to spend some money, there is still a way.' I refused again. Later, Qin Zhengru was sentenced to three years in prison (on August 21st)." This is completely consistent with the repeated statements of witness Zhu Yisheng. Although Qi Yougen has repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned, the testimony of Zhu Yisheng, the lawyer representing Lei Yunsheng in the case of Lei Yunsheng suing Wang Bingnan for counterfeiting trademarks, can be referenced. He said, "In this case, after Judge Tan held a court session on September 18th of last year, Yang Shaopeng came to my office and said, 'Don't worry about the Qin Zhengru case. Everything is the fault of the one named Gong.'" It can be determined that defendant Tan Zhuohong colluded with Gong Hanchu and leaked confidential information regarding the trial in advance in order to solicit bribes. In a letter from Tan Zhuohong's wife, Tan Li Ruyi, from Guangzhou, it said, "Gong Yu Chen Ru must be careful. You also hate him." Combined with what the old steward Qi Yougen said, "Gong Hanchu has a relationship with the defendant," this can further prove that Gong Hanchu solicited bribes on behalf of the defendant. Furthermore, observing the handling of the case, after Qin Zhengru was sentenced to three years in prison, he appealed to the second instance, and the original judgment was revoked, and Qin Zhengru was declared not guilty. Although the handling of the case involves different legal interpretations, the clues are still traceable. The statements of the witnesses coincide with each other, who can believe that it was not leaking secrets and soliciting bribes?</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Lei Yunsheng suing Wang Bingnan for counterfeiting trademarks, Zhu Yisheng, the lawyer representing Lei Yunsheng in the incidental civil suit, repeatedly stated, "After the court hearing in this case, Yang Shaopeng came to my office soon and said, 'Don't worry about the Qin Zhengru case. Everything is the fault of the one named Gong.' Later, Yang Shaopeng said, 'Now, in the case of Wang Bingnan counterfeiting trademarks, Judge Tan asked me to say that if you spend some money, you can get a satisfactory outcome.' I refused at first. On October 2nd, after the second court session, he called again and asked me to pay 2,000 yuan. I refused again. Soon, he called again and reduced it to 1,000 yuan. Later, he called again and reduced it to 400 yuan. When it was reduced to 400 yuan, it was after the end of the debate on the 18th. He gave you a last chance and reopened the debate. I was very strange about this. Yang Shaopeng revealed the Qin Zhengru case as soon as he opened his mouth, which made me believe that he was sent by Judge Tan. I wondered how Yang Shaopeng knew about the Qin Zhengru case." When questioning Zhao Deru, the business director of Lei Yunsheng, he stated, "After the lawsuit was filed, the criminal court held the first hearing. I went to Zhu Yisheng's office to inquire about the situation. Zhu Yisheng said, 'Yang Shaopeng came and asked us to spend some money on the court. We ignored it because the evidence was solid.'" The details of Zhu Yisheng's statements are consistent, and they are also connected to the facts of Gong Hanchu's statement by Wu Zhiquan. After defendant Tan Zhuohong took over the case, he declared the debate concluded on October 18, 1935, and then reopened the debate on the 27th of the same month. Whether there was a need to reopen the debate is questionable. Moreover, the witnesses who should have been summoned after reopening the debate had not yet fulfilled their duties. And the evidence of him leaking secrets to create opportunities for soliciting bribes is clear. There is no room for further defense.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the case of Wu Peizhen suing Li Keting for interfering with marriage, the case file shows that Wu Peizhen filed a private prosecution in her capacity as a spouse. The original judge, Lu Hongze, took leave, and defendant Tan Zhuohong took over. Witness Gao Junxiang stated, "The case was heard in October of this year. Judge Tan ordered the defendant to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan for bail, and then increased it to 10,000 yuan. Soon, Yang Shaopeng came to my office and said, 'Judge Tan is handling this case. There are many attachments to the lawsuit. What are your thoughts?' I was very strange at the time and said that Judge Tan's actions were inexplicable, and I had no opinion. At this time, Lawyer Lu Jiazi came and said that because of the spouse status, a private prosecution could not be filed, and illegally detaining the defendant was illegal." Lu Jiazi then said, "In October of last year, Wu Peizhen sued Li Keting for interfering with marriage. Li Keting first selected Gao Junxiang as his defense lawyer, fearing that Judge Tan, who was handling the case, had disagreements with Gao Junxiang. Later, I was added as a defense lawyer. After accepting the case, I went to Gao Junxiang's office on the 16th or 17th of the same month and saw Yang Shaopeng sitting there. I heard Gao Junxiang say, 'I have no opinion on this matter. Judge Tan's handling of the case is inexplicable.' I immediately said that since I had taken over this case, and since Yang Shaopeng was speaking on behalf of Judge Tan, I told Yang Shaopeng that Judge Tan's illegal detention of the defendant was wrong. I asked Yang Shaopeng to inform Judge Tan not to do such illegal things. The next day, I went to the court to request a hearing. Judge Tan then handed the defendant over to me to take back. Later, Judge Lu ruled that the case would not be accepted." This is consistent with what Gao Junxiang said. When questioned, Yang Shaopeng admitted that he went to Gao Junxiang's office and heard Lu Jiazi say that Judge Tan should not have accepted this case and stubbornly detained the defendant. I immediately called Judge Tan and asked him to refer to the law and handle this case carefully. Tan Zhuohong also stated in court that he was interrogated by you (referring to Yang Shaopeng) over the phone. Thus, he knowingly accepted a case that should not have been accepted, sometimes detaining and sometimes entrusting the defendant. Yang Shaopeng first hinted at soliciting a bribe, and then because Lu Jiazi's words were strong, he notified Tan by phone and then entrusted Li Keting. The situation of their collusion to solicit bribes is extremely obvious. Moreover, as evidenced by a letter from Yang Shaopeng from the detention center of this court to his wife Chen Qinbao, also known as Chen Xiuying, which stated, "Please ask Lawyer He Qi to visit Lawyer Lu Jiazi once and ask him for help. Just say that we happened to meet in Lawyer Gao Junxiang's office, and it was a friendly chat, discussing idle matters. Yang also had no other intentions. Regarding Lawyer Gao Junxiang, my dear wife, go to Lawyer Chen's office with Mr. Zhang Zhaomei and ask Lawyer Chen to speak on my behalf. Please ask Lawyer Gao to say the same thing as Lawyer Lu Jiazi, just saying that Lawyer Yang happened to come to my office to play one day, and everyone was chatting about idle matters, and Lawyer Yang had no other intentions regarding the case, and when he did have an opinion, it was after Lawyer Gao brought it up, and Yang said, 'What is your opinion from a legal standpoint?' and it was without any bad intentions." In this case, the defendants are making excuses for the truth and are attempting to get off lightly; the instructions to his wife suggest this. Moreover, it also says that the pair had no other intentions. If the defendant had not colluded to solicit bribes, why would he ask Lu Jiazi and Gao Junxiang to cover up for him? His heart had already contained ill-doing from the start. Furthermore, the evidence that Lu Jiazi offered to the court suggests his involvement. Lu Jiazi stated, "Yang Shaopeng is a good person, but an honest person is bound to get himself into trouble sometimes." He also said, "Judge Tan's reputation is not very good. His soliciting money has become an open secret. In the cases that have been exposed, he has not yet obtained the money. In the cases where he has already obtained the money, people are afraid of committing crimes and dare not reveal it." Even Lu Jiazi, whom Yang Shaopeng admires, testifies like this, which means that the defendants colluded to solicit bribes, which is already clear. Moreover, Wu Peizhen and Li Keting are spouses, and the Criminal Procedure Law clearly stipulates that they cannot file a private prosecution. The defendant, as a judge, cannot claim not to know this, but he still accepted the case illegally and arbitrarily detained the defendant. This is a violation of his duty. He then colluded with Yang Shaopeng to solicit bribes. The evidence of guilt is clear, so there is no need to explain it further.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the case of Cheng Li Tianzhi suing Xu Yi for counterfeiting documents, after Tan Zhuohong accepted the case, the plaintiff originally appointed Lawyer Li Shirui as his civil lawsuit representative. Later, due to Li Shirui's introduction, Yang Shaopeng was added as the representative on July 9th, and a fee of 4,000 yuan was agreed upon. Defendant Yang Shaopeng stated, "There are many rumors in Shanghai. They may think that I know Judge Tan, but in fact, it is all official business." He also said, "At that time, the newspaper reported that Xu Yi was sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The victim was represented by me. They thought that I had a relationship with Judge Tan. The rumors were so strong at the time that I was afraid to come to the local court." He refused to admit the fact that he solicited a bribe of 8,000 yuan from Cheng Li Tianzhi and handed it over to Tan Zhuohong. However, a letter signed by the Guangdong Tongyi Association (Yang Shaopeng did not deny the existence of the Tongyi Association in Guangdong in his court testimony) stated, "Yang Shaopeng's actions are indeed illegal, but it must be known that he was passive, and the principal offender is actually Judge Tan Zhuohong of your court's criminal court. Since being appointed as a judge, he has personally contacted Yang Shaopeng at his residence for every case. Sometimes, he would ask Yang to go to the Xiafei Apartment for secret talks in a separate room. The first time he solicited a bribe was in the Xu Yi case, when he asked Lawyer Li to obtain 8,000 yuan from the Cheng family and give it to Tan Zhuohong for expenses." Xu Yi also stated in court, "Judge Tan is very interested in money. Therefore, when trying cases, regardless of the size, the parties involved are often detained by him. If someone (referring to Yang Shaopeng) pleads on their behalf, they can be released on bail." He also said, "Judge Tan lives in the Xiafei Apartment and meets with Lawyer Yang there." These statements are consistent. Although Cheng Li Tianzhi denied the fact that defendant Yang Shaopeng solicited a bribe from him in court, the contract of engagement between Cheng Li Tianzhi and Yang Shaopeng, which this court reviewed, stated that 2,000 yuan would be paid first, and the remaining 2,000 yuan would be paid after a satisfactory judgment. Furthermore, the word "satisfactory" was crossed out. The case is still under trial, and whether Xu Yi is guilty is not yet known. However, Yang Shaopeng was able to use a satisfactory judgment as the object of the contract. This shows that he and defendant Tan Zhuohong colluded with each other, used cases to solicit bribes, and the details are obvious. Furthermore, Yang Shaopeng once said that they thought that I knew Judge Tan, and again that they thought that I had a relationship with Judge Tan. His blatant collusion with Tan Zhuohong to solicit bribes is tantamount to admitting it himself. Furthermore, referring to the points in the letter from Yang Shaopeng to his wife, the letter stated, "The two photos that I showed you in the corner of the Shanghai Local Court were written by that bastard (referring to Tan Zhuohong) to President Luo and President Cai, and the delivery receipt (everything below the writing in the original letter was smeared with ink). I have kept it all along because the thief Tan is untrustworthy. If the thief Tan harms me, I will use it as evidence, and the thief Tan will be in trouble. But don't show it now, so please find it and put it in Shen Fengzao's residence. Do not tear it up. This matter is a matter of life and death. I am afraid that my dear wife has not paid attention to it and has not done it well, so I will mention it again. Because the thief Tan is not human, the thief Tan wants to avoid getting wet himself and wants to accuse me of deception. If he is so unconscionable, my only evidence is the photos mentioned above. Also, in the drawer of the desk in my office, there is also a business card of the thief Tan, with a word on it written by the thief Tan, and a guest list of the thief Tan inviting Shen Fengzao and others to dinner at Dajiali. Please keep them safe and do not put them at home." And in the letter to Zhang Shizhao, it said, "If I do not uphold justice, he (referring to Tan Zhuohong) is really in trouble. His usual behavior is difficult to describe in one word." The defendant said that the thief Tan wanted to harm me, and I will use it as evidence, and the thief Tan will be in trouble; the thief Tan is not human and wants to avoid getting wet himself and wants to accuse me of deception; my only evidence is the photos mentioned above; if I do not uphold justice, he is really in trouble, and his usual behavior is difficult to describe in one word. His usual collusion with Tan Zhuohong to illegally solicit bribes is vividly displayed on paper. The letter was Yang Shaopeng's secret instruction to his wife, trying to eliminate his crimes. He did not expect to be discovered, so his true feelings were revealed unconsciously, and can be adopted. This is especially the most powerful and unique ironclad evidence for confirming the crime. Even if he had a hundred mouths, it would be difficult to defend himself. Furthermore, during the investigation, he entrusted the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to order Yang Shaopeng's wife and Shen Fengzao to hand over the photos and the guest list mentioned in the letter, but Shen Fengzao and others refused to hand them over, which can be definitively said to be evidence of soliciting bribes. Tan Zhuohong denied that he knew Yang Shaopeng well, saying that he only met him at a friend's house. However, judging from the tone of the letter, the defendant's intimacy and collusion with Yang Shaopeng is enough to prove it. Furthermore, when reviewing a business card of Tan Zhuohong found in Yang Shaopeng's home, Yang Shaopeng stated that the word "吾" on the business card was changed by Tan Zhuohong. Comparing it with the handwriting of Tan Zhuohong in court, it is clear that it was written by the same person, which further proves the collusion between Tan Zhuohong and Yang Shaopeng to solicit bribes, and there is no room for sophistry. Based on the above statements and evidence, the guilt of the defendants is clear, and they should be held responsible for their crimes. Their actions constitute the crime of a public official soliciting bribes for actions that violate their duties, knowingly accepting a case that should not be accepted, arbitrarily detaining the defendant, and leaking confidential information. Although Yang Shaopeng does not have the status of a public official, he participated in the actions that constitute the elements of the crime and should still be convicted of the same crime. Their successive actions have different methods of violating their duties, but they are based on a general intention to commit the same type of crime and should be considered as one crime. Furthermore, the crimes they committed are related, so the most severe punishment should be applied. Tan Zhuohong is a judge, and Yang Shaopeng is a lawyer. They should have cultivated integrity and set an example, but they violated the law and neglected their duties, which is unforgivable. Because they are continuous offenders, their sentences should be increased by one-half according to the law. After considering the circumstances, separate sentences should be imposed. The defendants are sentenced to more than six months of imprisonment. Based on the nature of the crime, it is deemed necessary to deprive them of their civil rights, and they are deprived of their civil rights separately. Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with Article 291, Article 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 28, Article 120, paragraph 1, Article 120, paragraph 1, item 1, Article 132, paragraph 1, Article 56, Article 55, Article 37, paragraph 2, and Article 31 of the Criminal Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Zhu Shufen performed his duties in court. June 25, 1936, Criminal Court of the Wuxian District Court of Jiangsu, Presiding Judge Yu Zhong, Judges Fang Qinghuan and Chen Ziguan.</p>

<h3>Ningxing Steamer Suspended for Repairs Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regular scheduled trip canceled once, passengers temporarily returned</p>
<p>The Ningxing steamer of the Sanbei Company, which is the regular scheduled ship between Shanghai and Ningbo, with sailings from Shanghai on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, also traveling to Zhenhai to load goods from the mainland, entered the port yesterday from Ningbo to Shanghai. It was discovered that the engine wings of the ship were damaged and could not sail. After the shipowner reported to the company, the company sent personnel to inspect the ship's wings and confirmed that they were damaged. If it continued to sail, it would be very dangerous. The company immediately ordered the Ningxing steamer to be opened to the plant for repair. According to the regulations for regular scheduled Shanghai-Ningbo ships, if an accident occurs and the schedule is suspended, a ship must be sent to sail in its place. At that time, there was no equivalent oceangoing ship in Shanghai, so the company had to suspend the ship for one trip and rush to repair the damaged wings in the next day and a half so that it could resume normal operations on Thursday. Passengers were notified, but the passengers did not know and arrived at the ship's wharf in Nanshi yesterday to board the ship and had to return temporarily. Some of them changed to the Xinjingtian steamer to go to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Two National Products Exhibitions in West and North Shanghai to Open Simultaneously on the 10th</h3>
<p>The two National Products Exhibitions in West and North Shanghai are both scheduled to open on the 10th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>West Shanghai</p>
<p>The West Shanghai National Products Exhibition, after the site was determined, construction of the exhibition hall began immediately. Originally scheduled to open today, due to continued requests from manufacturers to register and increase the number of booths, the opening was postponed. Therefore, it was decided that the temporary market would open first to participating manufacturers at 2:00 PM on the 8th. As for the opening ceremony, it will officially open at 2:00 PM on the 10th, after the additional booths are completed. At that time, Yin Hangbai, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will unveil the plaque, cut the ribbon, and raise the flag. The presidium will be composed of Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Jicheng, Yu Yuqing. The exhibition sent letters to all sectors of society stating: "We respectfully announce that the opening ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM on July 10th. In addition to inviting Mr. Yin Hangbai and Mr. Wang Xiaolai to unveil the plaque and raise the flag, refreshments will be served. We respectfully invite you to visit and provide guidance." The top of the invitation is also printed with Sun Yat-sen's last words, "Peace, Struggle, Save China," which is particularly thought-provoking.</p>
<p>North Shanghai</p>
<p>The North Shanghai National Products Exhibition is scheduled to open at 2:00 PM on the 10th. Due to continuous rainy weather in recent days, the construction of the venue could not proceed. Now that the weather has cleared, workers are rushing to complete the construction day and night to ensure the opening. There are a total of 150 booths and more than ten pavilions. An entertainment section has also been set up in the venue, with performances day and night, including storytelling, Shanghai opera, Suzhou ballad, and drama. More than 100 manufacturers have already participated, and efforts are still being made to recruit more national product factories to join. At the same time, to facilitate communication with factories, an office has been opened at the venue on Keming Road. A display section has also been set up in the venue to solicit free exhibits from factories.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association Establishes a Nursery in Gaoqiao Town, Currently Being Prepared for Opening Soon</h3>
<p>The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, recognizing the dense population and numerous factories in Gaoqiao Town, and to facilitate childcare for female employees, is jointly establishing a nursery in Gaoqiao Town with the Nursery Committee formed by people from Gaoqiao. The building has already been located and is being actively prepared for opening within this month. In addition, the three rural nurseries established by the association have already opened, accommodating more than 70 children. They will be closed after the busy farming season and reopened next year.</p>
<h3>French Concession Public Works Department Stipulates Regulations for Garbage Disposal</h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Department pays close attention to the issue of garbage disposal. Now is the summer season, and residents should pay particular attention to hygiene and cleanliness. The department has newly revised the regulations for garbage disposal as follows: Each resident should have a lightweight garbage bin with a lid for daily garbage disposal. The department has model garbage bins for sale. Unless otherwise agreed between the department and the property owner, all garbage collectors employed by the department must not enter private residences, private roads, or alleys. Residents should move the garbage bin to the roadside every morning when the garbage truck passes by, and the department's collectors will empty it. If the property owner requests the department's cleaners to sweep the garbage in private roads and alleys, the property owner must pay a handling fee in advance for six months at a time. The fee should be 4% of the total monthly rent of all houses in that area. The garbage truck passing time is as follows: from April 1st to September 30th every year, from 5:00 AM to 8:00 AM; from October to March 35th of the following year, from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM. Each garbage truck has a ringing bell to alert residents. Anyone who violates these regulations will be fined from one yuan to five yuan. Repeat offenders will be fined double. The following should be noted: the so-called garbage refers to the residue discarded from temples and the dust collected from homes. Leaves from gardens, animal feces, or bricks and soil should not be regarded as garbage and should be transported by the residents themselves. The department specially reminds citizens within the concession to pay attention, knowing that if garbage is disposed of on the road at will, there will be many disadvantages (such as breeding flies and breeding germs). It is hoped that citizens within the concession will abide by the regulations.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall Thoroughly Investigates the Solicitation of Publications and Advertisements Under False Pretenses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China and has been in operation for fifteen years. Every year, it has made unremitting efforts to promote national products. It is found that the exhibition hall had previously edited books such as "National Products Jinliang," "National Products Monthly," "National Products Yearbook," and "Essentials for Industry and Commerce" for the purpose of publicizing national products. Later, the exhibition hall decided that, except for "National Products Jinliang," all other publications would be discontinued and merged into "National Products Jinliang." Therefore, no other publications have been published recently. However, recently, unscrupulous people have been soliciting publication advertisements in the name of the exhibition hall. The exhibition hall has now discovered this and is conducting a thorough investigation. Please pay attention to all sectors of society. If such incidents are discovered again, please detain the person soliciting advertisements and notify the exhibition hall for investigation.</p>

<h3>Customs Administration Replies by Telegram, Ordering the Customs to Return the Seized Rough Jade</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously filed an administrative lawsuit regarding the seizure and punishment of rough jade that had already been taxed and fined by the customs.

<h3>Qingfuxing Silver Shop Accused Of Receiving Pledged Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>Police Issued Loss Report</p>

<h3>Six Thousand Yuan Is Like A Single Hair - Gangsters Extort Ma Bosun</h3>
<p>Police Track Down Clues Inside Telephone Company, Apprehended Five Gangsters For Investigation, Ma's Chauffeur Is Highly Suspected</p>
<p>Ma Bosun, the grandson of the famous Jiangwan ENT doctor Ma Fengfu, has a residence at No. 902 Haiphong Road, and has another branch clinic at No. 4, Lane 830, Beijing Road. Because he is a family-inherited ENT doctor, his life is not bad, and he owns a lot of inheritance, so he was coveted by gangs. Recently, Ma Bosun received two threatening letters from gangs, intending to extort thousands of yuan, pointing out that Ma has a lot of real estate in Jiangwan, and this mere six thousand yuan is like plucking a hair. If you are willing to contact, please send someone with a chauffeur</p>
<p>holding a plantain fan</p>
<p>as a marker, to the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. Someone will negotiate. Otherwise, we'll let you have a taste of a handgun. The names signed were Assassination Squad key figure Robber He Er. Iron Head Gen Bao. Unkillable Lao Wu. Three-Axe A Mao. Long-Limbed Xiao Di. Nitric Acid Chun Sheng, and six others. They also stated that the team was short of travel expenses, so they were borrowing 6,000 yuan from you. But do not report to the police, to avoid a lot of trouble, because everyone we send has a handgun by their side. After Ma received the letter, he ignored it. Until 9:30 AM the day before yesterday, Ma Bosun suddenly received a telephone call from someone claiming to be</p>
<p>Zhang by telephone</p>
<p>demanding six thousand yuan, Ma then reported to the Jietie Division Police Station, and Chinese Detective Chief Shang Wu, Detectives Li Wenbin, and Western Detective Chief Gibson were in charge of the investigation. On the one hand, they immediately went to the Shanghai Telephone Company on Jiangxi Road to inquire about the source of the telephone, and waited in the company for any further telephone calls from the gangsters. At 10:20, the gangsters did make another telephone call to Ma. The Chinese and Western detectives, in addition to instructing Ma to deliberately prolong</p>
<p>the connection time</p>
<p>, also had the telephone company determine that the call was made from a tailor shop at No. 21, Saitai Ping Lane, 50 Maibaige Road. The Chinese and Western detectives rushed to No. 22 Tai Ping Lane, broke into the room, and saw the gangster Wang Yiting, a native of Zhenjiang, still negotiating with Ma on the phone. They heard Wang saying that at least 6,000 yuan was required. His accomplice Wang Sanzi, a native of Yangzhou (driver of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road), was standing next to him. The detectives arrested both Wangs and took them to the Huishi Police Station. According to Wang Yiting's confession, he was good at</p>
<p>writing threatening letters</p>
<p>, but this matter was initiated by A Gui, who was on the run, and Chen Genlin, a local, provided information. After investigation, the police found that Chen Genlin was Ma Bosun's chauffeur. Ma had a private car with the number 1640.) Chen was arrested, and his accomplice Sun Xiaomao, a native of Tongzhou (namely, Hai Hanxian, the driver of a certain family at No. 383 Beile Road in the concession), was subsequently apprehended. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau also</p>
<p>arrested accomplices</p>
<p>Zhang Gengsheng, a local (totaling five people), at No. 2, Huaqing Lane, Fanghong Road, Nanshi. At around 8:00 AM, Wang Yiting and others were sent to the Criminal Court of Special District One. Police Legal Counsel Zhang Tianyin, in addition to stating the above situation, also requested that Wang and the other five be detained for further investigation. According to Ma Bosun's report, he was from Jiangwan, 24 years old, and lived at No. 902 Haiphong Road. Chen Genlin was his chauffeur, but as to whether Chen</p>
<p>was involved</p>
<p>in this case, he was not aware. However, Sun Xiaomao had visited Chen Genlin at his home once. When Wang Yiting was interrogated, he confessed that the two threatening letters were written at the request of A Gui, who was on the run. He said that a Chen, namely Zhang Gengsheng, was related to the Ma family, but Ma did not pay him the money and had a quarrel with him. Therefore, he asked him to write a letter to demand it. However, the names at the end of the letter were all fabricated.</p>
<p>Chen Genlin</p>
<p>denied providing information. The other three defendants also denied involvement. Finally, Police Legal Counsel Zhang stated that Ma Bosun had purchased a diamond ring with a huge amount of money last year. Only his chauffeur Chen Genlin knew about this at the time. But yesterday morning, when Wang Yiting was talking to Ma on the phone, he also mentioned the purchase of the diamond ring. Therefore, it must have been Chen Genlin who provided the information. Judge Tan Xinzhen reviewed the confession and ordered the defendants to be detained for further interrogation in seven days.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the stolen goods from the Weihaigwei Road case were 6 liang and 1 fen of gold, converted into 623.8 yuan. The gold ring from the Jing'an Villa case was converted into 16 yuan. The 26 pieces of jewelry from the Metherst Road case were 3 liang, 3 qian, 3 fen of gold, converted into 314 yuan. The police had issued a loss report to the silver shop within three days of the theft. The silver shop did not send the pawned items to the police after receiving the loss report, indicating a suspicion of knowingly buying stolen goods. Therefore, Police Legal Counsel Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution against the owner of the silver shop, Chuan Xingmao, a native of Ningbo, in the First Special Court in accordance with Article 349, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and Article 34 of the Public Works Department's Supplemental Law, Article 5 of the Silver Shop Notification. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin summoned him to the Criminal Court Five for interrogation. Chuan Xingmao hired lawyer Jiang Yiping as his representative, who argued that the prices of the items received were not too low, and that according to Article 5 of the Association's Articles of Association, the police should only be notified if suspicious circumstances were discovered. Also, the loss report should be delivered within five days of the incident, but this time the loss report was received on the sixth day, so he could not be held responsible. The court stated that the case still required Chen Zhiliang to be brought to court, as well as the clerk who redeemed the stolen goods and the investigation of the delivery date of the loss report. It was announced that the hearing would be adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zhou Mingjiu Lied That His Wife Was Dead And Seduced His Aunt-In-Law</h3>
<p>Abandoned Her After She Became Pregnant Ouyang Bibo Sues For Seduction</p>
<p>Zhou Mingjiu, 46, a native of Anhui and manager of the Gongmao Government Salt Depot, residing at No. 12 Lianzhuli, Aivenyi Road, was recently sued in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court by Ouyang Bibo, 34, a widow from Xiangyang, Hunan, residing at No. 429 Buber Road, French Concession, for seduction and abandonment after becoming pregnant. The indictment stated that the plaintiff had been a widow for eight years and was a teacher at the Chuanmei Embroidery School on Aivenyi Road. On April 18th of last year, she met the defendant and, after his repeated pursuit, went to Hangzhou with the defendant on August 15th of the lunar calendar and cohabitated in the Xintai Hotel, resulting in her loss of chastity. At that time, the defendant falsely stated that his first wife, Wu Min, was dead, but that there were many children in the family and some had already been married, and there was no one to take care of them. Therefore, it would be better to cohabitate outside first and then return home to formally hold a wedding. The plaintiff, a woman, made a big mistake. After returning to Shanghai, they cohabitated at No. 13 Huoxing Lane, Datong Road, and then moved to No. 5 Tianfu Lane, Chihang Road, etc. Later, because the defendant was sick at home, his mother went to visit him and learned that the defendant's wife was still alive, and that everything he had said before was a lie. At this time, the plaintiff felt like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, but because she was pregnant, she had to endure the deception. Unexpectedly, the defendant disappeared from then on and abandoned the plaintiff, which constitutes the crime of abandonment under Article 294 of the Criminal Law and should be punished according to the law. The court approved the petition and ordered the defendant to be summoned. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the interrogation in Criminal Court Two. The defendant Zhou Mingjiu did not arrive, but his lawyer appeared in court and stated that the defendant was currently in Yuyao, Shaoxing, and could not arrive in court today, requesting an adjournment. According to the plaintiff Ouyang Bibo, she was previously married to a Chen, but unfortunately her husband died early, so she worked for the Hankou Municipal Government and then went to Shanghai to teach embroidery at the Bomei Embroidery School. On the way on April 18th of last year, the defendant suddenly called her Mr. Chen. She recalled that she had met the defendant once at a reception in Hankou, and after talking, the defendant learned that she worked at the Bomei School and began to seduce her. At first, it was a friendly relationship, but she was deceived and lost her virginity at the Xintai Hotel in Hangzhou on August 16th. She explained the details of the experience as above, saying that the defendant's father used to be the governor of Jiangxi, but now the defendant has repeatedly deceived and raped her, causing her to become pregnant for several months and then abandoning her. She requested that he be interrogated. Judge Zhong reviewed the confession and ordered the hearing to be adjourned for seven days because the defendant had not arrived.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Capture of Gang Leader in Shanzhen, Huzhou</h3>
<p>Three Robbers Including Chen Shenghong Have Been Sent to Zhejiang</p>
<p>After Shansuzhen, Huzhou, Zhejiang, was robbed by forty or fifty members of the Anhui gang on the sixth of last month, Xu Renrong, the detective captain of the Zhejiang Water Police Brigade, immediately led detectives like Hu Changhua to various places to hunt down the stolen goods. Recently, they received a tip that the gang leaders in the case, Chen Shenghong, Ruan Hanqing (also known as Yi Zhen), Zhou Bingwu (also known as Cao Jiapin), and others, were hiding in the Yangshupu area of the Shanghai Public Concession to avoid capture. Xu, along with Detective Hu and detectives Wu Shaoqing, Lu Xiang, and Wang Zhanyuan, rushed to Shanghai overnight. Together with the police, at 7:00 AM on the fourth of this month, in heavy rain, they captured the three robbers one after another. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. The report on the case of Chen and the three robbers being allowed to be transferred has already been published in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that Chen Shenghong, Ruan Hanqing, and Zhou Bingwu have been transferred to the First Brigade of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police by the Fifth Team of Zhejiang yesterday for investigation. They will also strictly pursue and arrest the remaining gang members to ensure the peace and security of the area.</p>
<h3>Han Xu Shi Charged with Adultery and Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Han Xu Shi, the 27-year-old wife of Han Zhishan, a Yangzhou native living at No. 1039 Dong Youheng Road in the Public Concession, has been having an affair with Wang Jiashan, a 36-year-old Nanjing native working as a clerk (and living near Han). Initially, they carried on their affair secretly, but later they eloped together, rented a house, and lived together as husband and wife for several months. Until last week, her husband discovered that Wang and his wife were hiding at No. 5, Lane 62, Rue Gan Si Dong in the French Concession. He reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Wang and Xu Shi and sent them to the Second Special Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Peng, acting as the criminal judge of the Eighth Court, conducted the trial. The police lawyer prosecuted her for the crime of disrupting the family. Then, the plaintiff Han Zhishan recounted the details of his wife's affair and elopement with Wang, requesting legal action. In court, the defendants Wang Jiashan and Han Xu Shi both confessed to adultery. The judge adjourned the debate and set a date for sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Various Physical Evidence in the Case of the Japanese Sailor: Key Points of Identification Divided into Four Categories</p>
<h3>Forensic Institute Reports Identification Results to Court</h3>
<p>Shooting Distance Does Not Match Ye Haisheng's Demonstration</p>
<p>Fingerprint in Book Cannot Prove Yang Wendao</p>
<p>Traces in the Dug-out Room Were Not Caused by the Weight of the Pistol</p>
<p>No Human Cells or Tissues Found on the Bullet</p>
<p>This Case Will Be Continued This Afternoon</p>
<p>The case where Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong, Cantonese, were accused by the Public Concession Bureau of killing Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo on Doulean Road on November 9th of last year has been publicly tried by the First Special District Court's joint collegial panel several times. The court deemed it necessary to send the confiscated firearms, physics books, and recovered bullets for identification to the Zhenru Forensic Institute, so it announced a postponement of the trial. This has been reported in this newspaper many times. Now, the Forensic Institute has followed the court's instructions and conducted research on the case's pistol, bullets, Yang Wendao's fingerprints, and the books, based on the court's inquiries. The research has been completed, and a report has been made for each type of identification, totaling four identification reports. The reports detail the results obtained based on academic theory. These identification reports have been submitted to the First Special Court, so the court has scheduled a retrial for 2:00 PM today. The trial will still be conducted by a collegial panel, and the lawyer representing the police, Ru Baoyi, has recovered from his illness and will be replaced by Li Zhishan. Ru will appear in court today. The Special Court has instructed the police to summon the Korean Jack and the Japanese-Chinese doctor Zheng Huimin for questioning, but they have not appeared in court due to various reasons. The Public Concession Bureau is currently in contact with the Japanese Consulate, hoping that the two witnesses can testify in court today. Whether they can appear is still unknown. If time permits, the debate may begin, but it depends on the progress of the trial. It is difficult to predict at this time. Now, the points of identification requested by the First Special Court from the Forensic Institute and the results of the Institute's identification are excerpted below. The academic explorations in the identification report are omitted because the full text is four large volumes, totaling tens of thousands of words.</p>
<p>Shooting Distance</p>
<p>(1) The Special Court requested an investigation into whether the distance Ye Haisheng indicated when demonstrating the shooting at the scene of the incident, which was about five or six steps behind the victim Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, was consistent with the victim's injuries. Two photos of the victim's injuries and a diagram of the diagnosis certificate were included for rapid identification. The Institute made an identification and produced an identification report, which included eleven photos. The conclusion generally stated that the distance of the presumed shooting is usually based on the traces around the wound. Although the distance at the time of the shooting can also be inferred from the angle formed by the entry and exit points of the bullet, it can only be based on the normal state of the victim and shooter. If the head is tilted up or down, it cannot be speculated afterwards. According to the traces around the wound on the right side of the posterior mandible of Nakayama Hideo, the shooting distance is about five centimeters, which is inconsistent with Ye Haisheng's demonstration of five or six steps away from the victim, and it is not the condition that can be formed at about fifty centimeters as estimated in the diagnosis certificate. That is, according to the angle marked on the diagnosis certificate, if the perpetrator is estimated to have fired the pistol at a distance of five steps, that is, about three meters and forty centimeters from the victim, and after subtracting the length of the right arm, there are still about two meters and seventy centimeters left. If the shooter fired at a location of two meters and seventy centimeters while lying on the ground, it can still form the angle marked on the diagnosis certificate. Considering all the above points, according to the condition of the bullet entry point in the photo, it is definitely not a wound that can be formed by shooting from a distance of five steps behind the victim.</p>
<p>Fingerprint in Book</p>
<p>The First Special Court sent Yang Wendao's fingerprint on a single sheet of paper, requesting identification of whether it matches the fingerprint found in the book. According to the Institute's conclusion, the description of fingerprints is extremely complex, so the fingerprints left on the evidence can be used as the basis for criminal investigation. Although there are several incomplete fingerprints left in the physics book sent earlier, they are all incomplete short lines, and the monthly lines are not clear. On the lower part of page 37 of the book, there is a light blue incomplete fingerprint, the color of which is similar to the color of the edge of the hole dug in the book, and it seems that the central and left or right triangular patterns are missing. Only a few short lines are left, and detailed research has been conducted within the possible range of the remaining lines. The fingerprints of the left and right hands of Yang Wendao, which were sent for comparison, were also compared with each other. Because the light blue fingerprint left at the bottom of page 37 of the book is only a rectangular pattern of a part of the finger, and there is no special feature that can be seen, it cannot be proved that there are also such lines in Yang Wendao's fingerprints.</p>
<p>Hole in the Book</p>
<p>(3) The First Special Court sent pistol No. 241146 and a practical physics book, requesting identification of how long it would take for rust to appear if the pistol were hidden in the hole dug in the book, whether the traces and horizontal pressure marks in the book were left naturally or artificially, whether there were blue pencil marks at the binding of the book (i.e., the right page of page 16), how long the blue color has been left on the paper, whether the knife marks around the hole dug in the book are old or new, and how long has passed since the hole was dug. The Institute made various studies in the identification report and attached nine photos. The conclusion was that it would take some time for rust to appear if the pistol were hidden in the hole dug in the book. Rust is the oxidation of iron in the air to form iron oxide, which is yellowish-red-brown, and is called rust. The temperature of the air in the place where it is placed and whether there is grease attached to the surface of the pistol can affect the speed of chlorination. Therefore, only rust cannot estimate the time it has been collected. Whether the traces and horizontal pressure marks in the book were left naturally or artificially. After detailed comparison, the distance or length of each line of the horizontal pressure marks in the book examined earlier is consistent with the straight raised lines on the back of the barrel. Therefore, this pistol or a pistol of the same brand and size can leave such pressure marks. However, the pressure marks are deep, and there are two holes formed on the paper opposite the pistol's safety. The one in front is the imprint of the safety mechanism when it is closed, and the one in the back is the imprint when the safety is opened. The edges are turned up with rust spots and oil stains. The pressure marks in front are as deep as ten pages, and when irradiated with ultraviolet light, they show obvious oil stain fluorescence, which should be oil stains. The horizontal traces are located above, from page 16 to page 12, and are very clear. The ones located below, from page 1283 to page 399, are also very clear. The weight of the pistol is only 600 grams, and it is not easy to form such deep traces and holes even if it is placed in the book for a long time. Therefore, such deep penetrating pressure marks are not easy to form without external pressure. For example, heavy books or other heavy objects may have fallen on the book, and the pistol-shaped hole dug in the book is about 0.6 centimeters longer than the pistol, so the pistol can still move in the hole. If there is shaking, it may form this kind of hole. If only relying on the weight of the pistol itself, it seems that it cannot be arranged to form the existing falling traces in the book. The blue pencil marks are left at the binding of the book (i.e., the right page of page 16). The blue color has been left on the paper for some time. The blue writing is drawn with a blue pencil containing wax. The color of this kind of trace is not easy to change. Therefore, there is a lack of proper methods to explain the length of time after the drawing. The hole dug in the book was dug with a knife. Whether the knife marks around the dug hole are old or new, and how long has passed since the hole was dug. The gun-shaped marks in the book are neat around, and only slightly rough on the left side. The color is not significantly different from the color of the paper surface. In general paper cut marks, the age can be judged by the depth of the color, but the gun-shaped cut marks inspected this time are in the book, and it is not easy to contact with external light and dust, so it is difficult to measure the time elapsed.</p>
<p>Bullet Bloodstains</p>
<p>(4) The First Special Court sent a No. 19 bullet, requesting identification of whether it had passed through the human body, whether there were bloodstains, whether bloodstains could not be left if the bullet passed through the human body, and whether they could be detected after wiping off the bloodstains. The Institute attached two photos and concluded that no bloodstains were found on the bullets sent for inspection, and no human tissue cells were found in the precipitate of the bullet immersion solution. Can bloodstains not be left if the bullet passes through the human body? If it only penetrates a part of the human body and remains in the body, the bullet taken out by autopsy should have bloodstains and adherent human tissue cells. As for whether bloodstains should be left on the bullet if it passes through the human body and falls to other places, there is a lack of such literature and examples in forensic medicine for reference. However, according to theory, if a bullet passes through the human body, it should have attached human tissue. However, it is worth studying whether this situation differs due to the shooting distance. It is also worth studying whether the bloodstains attached to it can be destroyed by heat if the bullet penetrates the human body at that time, and how much the heat is reduced during the process of the bullet passing through the human body, and how the temperature reduction is recorded after passing through the air at different temperatures. There is also a lack of such literature in forensic medicine. The research on whether the human tissue attached to the bullet can be destroyed by heat involves the scope of ballistics, and this Institute lacks this equipment and cannot conduct experiments. It is only explained by the results of shooting animal experiments. Now, the chest and abdomen of live dogs are shot at distances of about 30 cm, 50 cm, and 1 meter with the same type of pistol and bullets. The bullets penetrate the body cavity and窜 into the cotton. Then, the bullets are taken out one by one, and detailed bloodstain examination and tissue cell examination are carried out by various methods. The results are all negative, and there are no bloodstains on the cotton attached to the bullets. According to the results of this kind of experiment, it can be known that bullets that penetrate the animal body in close-range shooting may not leave bloodstains. If there are bloodstains, if only wiped with paper or cloth, there will be bloodstains in the rifling and at the rear end of the bullet. If it has been treated with chemicals, it is to destroy human protein or soak in water for a long time, which can also cause the protein to dissolve and fall off. If there are the above-mentioned situations, it is impossible to detect human protein during the test. The above are all fair explanations based on academic facts. What needs to be explained is that this identification report was sent to the court, and the court notified the defense lawyers of the three defendants to come to the court to read it. Now it has been completed, so there may be fierce debates on this identification when the trial opens today.</p>
<h3>Abducted Girl Shows Resourcefulness</h3>
<p>Crying Out "Elder Sister" to Get Help</p>
<p>Shi's daughter, Miss Chen, is ten years old this year, with a beautiful and lovely face. A few days ago, she was abducted in the countryside by a strange man wearing yellow clothes and taken to Shanghai by car. On the night before yesterday, the abductor took the girl and another boy past the entrance of the Great World on Rue Sainte Marie in the French Concession. Zhou Wu Shi, a local young woman (21 years old) living at No. 741 Route Courbet, came towards them. Miss Chen saw that Wu Shi was dressed elegantly, so she cried out "Elder Sister" to her. The abductor heard the cry and, realizing the situation, abandoned the girl and fled with the other boy. Zhou Wu Shi took the girl home, inquired about the abduction, gave her food, and comforted her. Then she reported it to the Gu French Police, and Detective Xu Guilin took the girl to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Eighth Court of the Second Special Court for instructions. Judge Sun Peng questioned the girl and then instructed Chen Da Jie to be temporarily sent to a charitable organization for care, pending investigation and notification of her family to come and claim her.</p>
<h3>Wang Shubao, Suspect in the Assassination of Ji Zhongtang, Re-tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Many Witnesses Failed to Appear: Judge Adjourns for Further Trial</p>
<p>Wang Shubao, the owner of Xiangwu, was accused by anonymous letter of instigating the shooting of Ji Zhongtang, a Fujian native, at 128 o'clock. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu De opened the court for a retrial. Detective Wu Xiufeng testified that he had been ordered by the captain at the end of May last year to arrest Wang Shubao. Later, Zhang Xiaowanzi was summoned to court to testify, saying that there was another Wang Shubao, so he was released after being detained for one day. What is the reason for being released as soon as you are caught? The answer is that there is no relationship, so the captain Lu Ying released him at his own discretion. At this point, the wife of the deceased, Wu Shi, testified that the deceased's brother, Ji Rentang, did not come today, and I don't know why. I also don't know who killed my husband. I saw it in the newspaper, so I sued. At this point, because many witnesses did not arrive, the judge adjourned the trial for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Throwing Lime and Tying Hands: Robbery and Capture of Police Handgun</h3>
<p>Robbers Had a Planned Robbery: Five Robbers Fled and Four Were Captured</p>
<p>At 2:45 AM yesterday morning, five robbers went to Fumin Village on Chengdu Road, Xinzha, intending to rob. Because the landlord, Siming Bank, had set up a guard post in the back alley of the village, the police officer Zhou Jinsheng, a native of Xuzhou, who was assigned by the police station, was living in the wooden pavilion. The robbers were afraid that the guard would discover them during the robbery and make it difficult, so in order to take the initiative, they first broke into the wooden pavilion. One robber took out a pistol to scare Zhou and prevent him from speaking out. Another robber threw lime at Zhou's head and face, hoping to blind him. The remaining three robbers then</p>
<p>Tied up</p>
<p>Zhou's hands behind his back, they seized the policeman's loaded five-round pistol and fled out of the wooden pavilion. Although Zhou's eyes were attacked, fortunately, he was not blinded, so he bravely pursued them. The robbers had no time to rob the residents' property and fled southwest, passing through Rue Sainte Marie and other places. When they reached Rue Paulat in the French Concession, police officers No. 109 and No. 806 of the French police assisted in intercepting Shen Xinhua and Yu Zhanglong, and also recovered the</p>
<p>Robbers Abandoned Pistol</p>
<p>and took them back to the Xinzha police station. They confessed that their accomplices were hiding at No. 155 Rue Paulat. Then Detective Feng Baishun, Detective Sun Wenxi, Detective Kong Guangxiao, and others, along with the Western detectives, took the two robbers Shen and Yu to search. After passing Rue Kim, they intercepted Chen Jin San (also known as Xiao Sizi). Later, they found Hu Yuansheng (also known as Wang Haishan) in the house at No. 155 Rue Paulat. Four of the five robbers were finally captured. Only one Wang Sanduanzi escaped</p>
<p>Escaped</p>
<p>The loaded pistol that Zhou was robbed of was also found in a 　 gasoline barrel under Chen's bed and taken back to the police station. After questioning and investigation, it was learned that all four robbers were from Anhui. Shen had committed a robbery in the past and was sentenced to nine years in prison by the Second Special District Court. He was imprisoned until last year, and his sentence still had more than five years left, and he was granted parole. However, the robber did not repent and gathered accomplices to commit illegal acts. When seizing the weapon, Shen used a pistol</p>
<p>To scare Zhou</p>
<p>Yu used a rope to tie Zhou's hands, Chen took lime and threw it on Zhou's face, and Hu and the fugitive robbed Zhou's gun. This kind of teamwork shows that they had planned in advance. Then Detective Feng and others sent the four robbers Shen, Yu, Chen, and Hu, along with the firearms, to the First Special District Local Court for Judge Tan to interrogate. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the process and requested an extension. The court interrogated each robber and ordered them to be detained for a retrial in seven days.</p>

<p>Datong News Agency reported that the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association initiated the celebration of Mr. Yu Xia Xiang's 70th birthday and the 55th anniversary of his stay in Shanghai. After the grand ceremony was held in the association's venue on Tibet Road for the past two days, the association's opera and other shows continued until 2:00 AM yesterday morning, which can be said to be very grand. This morning, the triads in this city continued to gather on Tibet Road, Ningbo Road, and Route Lloyd, forming a surrounding shape to the association. The number reached thousands of people, which was quite chaotic. After the Lao Zha police station received the news, a large number of Chinese and Western police were dispatched to suppress the situation, and they gradually dispersed.</p>
<h3>Three Fire Alarms in One Day</h3>
<p>Medicinal Herb Store</p>
<p>At around 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at Dingfa Medicinal Herb Store, No. 254 Da Matou Street, 16th Pu, Nanshi. Because the store was full of medicinal herbs upstairs and downstairs, most of which were flammable materials, it quickly spread and became a prairie fire. The fire was extinguished after two hours of rescue by the fire brigades of various districts in Nanshi. It is estimated that three buildings were destroyed, with losses of over ten thousand gold. The store's manager, Mr. Li, was at the store at the time. The 16th Pu branch immediately sent police to summon the store clerk Zhou Yongxiao for questioning to investigate the cause of the fire.</p>
<p>Foreign Brothel</p>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at a foreign brothel at No. 481 Jiangxi Road. Immediately, smoke billowed like ink, and the flames soared. The fire was out of control. Later, the Central Fire Brigade dispatched a leather car to rescue, and it was extinguished until 8:00 AM. When the fire was raging, a Russian prostitute jumped from the window on the second floor, breaking her left leg and fainting on the ground. She was transported to Gongji Hospital by ambulance. According to the doctor, the prostitute's leg bone needs to be amputated, which may lead to disability. Although the fire was extinguished, the internal property and houses were almost completely burned down.</p>
<p>Tailor Shop</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at Tongtaiqing Tailor Shop, No. 455 Rue Paulat, French Concession, because the shop owner Yao Fugen accidentally caught fire when he was using gasoline to wipe off oil stains. At that time, the fire spread very quickly and quickly broke through the roof. Later, the fire brigade heard the alarm and drove to the scene to rescue and extinguish the fire. As a result, a building was burned down.</p>
<h3>Claiming to be the Editor of the Hualian News Agency to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>The news agency reported that Hu Chunyu, a man who had claimed to be the editor of the Hualian News Agency, had requested donations from the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau a week ago. After the bureau inquired with the person in charge of the Hualian News Agency, it was said that the agency did not have a Hu Chunyu. When Hu came to the bureau, please notify the news agency to pursue him. Last Saturday, Hu came to the bureau again to request donations. The bureau notified Hualian, and Hualian reported it to the police. Hu was arrested and transferred to the Second Special District Court for trial the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Manager Zhou Yun is Accused of Abandonment by His Concubine</h3>
<p>Zhou Yunheng, a native of Ningbo and manager of the Yuantaiheng Sugar Shop on Yanghang Street, Xiaodongmen, is 35 years old. He married a woman named Qiu, who had a younger sister named Qiu Gengli, now 24 years old, with a beautiful appearance. Zhou was fond of women and often thought of seducing her. Gengli stayed at her sister's house because she was ill and was seduced by Zhou. Therefore, the brother-in-law became the husband of the younger sister and wrote a marriage agreement in January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, living with his sister in Ningbo. In the beginning, he liked her very much. Although the sisters married the same man, the vinegar jar often overturned. In recent times, the elder sister gave birth to a son, and Zhou inevitably favored the elder sister over the younger sister. Therefore, Gengli was abused and came to Shanghai to ask her husband to set up a separate golden house, but was rejected and had no livelihood. Angered, she sued in the local court, first for rape as a concubine, and then for abandonment, requesting legal action. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened the court and ordered Zhou to post bail pending trial.</p>
<h3>New Zhabei Branch: Patrol Officer Accused, Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Sergeant No. 060 and Constable No. 1378 Wen Shi-ying of the New Zhabei Branch were previously accused by Wu Xiao-san of Funing, Haichang Road, Zhabei, of demanding illegal fees from the Huayang Tea House and illegally detaining him when the demand was not met, requesting legal action. Wen Shi-ying was sentenced to 59 days of detention with a suspended sentence. Before the dust had settled, another wave arose. Now, Wu Ren-fu of Funing, who runs the Desheng Tea House at No. 395 Datong Road, Zhabei, has also hired lawyer Chen Guang-yuan to accuse Long Jian-po, a patrol officer of the branch, of abusing his power and illegally detaining him because of a grudge against Wu Ren-fu for testifying in the previous case at the Public Security Bureau, requesting legal action. Yesterday at 9:00 AM, Judge Li opened the court. Wu Ren-fu recounted the previous events, while Patrol Officer Long completely denied them. The judge ordered further investigation and review.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Survives Hanging, Recovers with Good Fortune</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 PM last night, a couple with the surname Chang from Yangzhou, residing at No. 537 Tongfu Tian, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, had a quarrel over a minor matter. Chang's wife, Ms. Hu, 23 years old, hanged herself. Fortunately, someone discovered her early enough. She was immediately taken to the Pu Shan Hospital on Xinmin Road, where Dr. Mai Shirong performed surgery and administered injections. She recovered with good fortune and is now out of danger.</p>
<h3>Sun Qi-shun Impersonates Detective and Extorts</h3>
<p>Daring to Act Violently, Sent to the General Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>Sun Qi-shun, 38 years old, the owner of the Jiangbei Great World in Zhabei, formerly worked as a detective. At around 10:00 PM last night, he tried to extort Chen Qi-yuan, a Qidong villager residing on Xieqiao Temple Jiang Road. When the extortion failed, he threatened and assaulted him. A patrol officer who witnessed the incident attempted to arrest him. Sun then impersonated a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau and fled, but was eventually apprehended. After questioning at the North Station Branch, he was charged with attempted fraud and impersonating a detective and sent to the General Bureau for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Barber Abducts and Conceals Young Girl</h3>
<p>Yang Ting-huai, a 40-year-old barber from Yangzhou, runs the Huaxing Barber Shop at the intersection of Zhongxing Road and Xibao Xing Road in Zhabei. He has an 18-year-old daughter named Zhao-di, who usually earns a living by sorting tea leaves at a nearby tea shop. A barber from the same hometown, Bian Jin-ju, saw that Zhao-di was somewhat attractive and young and easily deceived, so he tried to seduce her in every possible way. On the morning of the 29th of last month, Zhao-di went to work at the tea shop as usual, but was tricked and taken to the third floor of the Guangji Barber Shop at No. 3689 Zhaofeng Road in the Concession, where they rented a room and lived together. Yang Ting-huai did not see his daughter return home and searched everywhere without success. He knew that Bian Jin-ju must have abducted and concealed her, but he could not find her immediately. Last night (i.e., the night before last) at around 10:00 PM, Yang went to the Qingji Barber Shop on Baoshan Road to participate in a rotating credit association and happened to see Bian Jin-ju in the shop. He immediately grabbed Bian and called the police, who took him to the North Station Public Security Branch. After a brief interrogation by Officer Wu, Bian directly admitted to abducting and concealing Zhao-di, but claimed that Zhao-di voluntarily followed him. After obtaining this statement, Officer Wu immediately ordered the leaders of the detective squad, Gu Lian-cheng and Guo Meng-qu, along with detectives, to go to the building at No. 369 Zhaofeng Road, accompanied by Chinese and foreign detectives dispatched by the Jiaxing Road Police Station. They rescued Zhao-di and took her back to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, the case was deemed to involve allegations of interfering with a family and seducing a young girl. Therefore, they immediately handed her over to the original detective squad to take her back to Zhabei for investigation. It is reported that the plaintiff Yang Ting-huai, the defendant Bian Jin-ju, and the young girl Yang Zhao-di were all sent to the Public Security General Bureau for disposition yesterday.</p>
<h3>Using Magic to Deceive: 31 Yuan Transformed into 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yuan San-bao, a 22-year-old from Shaoxing, living at No. 147 Jinyuan Lane, Dalin Road, Nanshi, makes flags for a living. A few days ago, while passing the intersection of Xieqiao Vegetable Market Road, he saw Li Yifei and Qiao Yonglin, who claimed to be teaching magic, claiming that they could turn 31 yuan into 3,000 yuan. Yuan, temporarily blinded by greed, handed over the money in full. Qiao and Li then placed the legal tender in a lighter box, tied it with a red string, burned two pieces of yellow paper, and taught him a spell, ordering him to return home and open it, where it would surely be transformed. Yuan immediately returned home. Before he had taken many steps, the magicians, feeling guilty and planning to escape, Yuan realized he had been deceived. He caught Qiao, twisted him, and handed him over to the patrol officer to take to the bureau. Qiao confessed Li's address, and Li was also arrested. Both were sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Fudan Female Student Robbed on the Road</h3>
<p>Wang Hui-sheng, a 25-year-old woman from Yunnan, studies at Fudan University. Currently on summer vacation, she lives at No. 169 Wenmiao Road, Nanshi. Yesterday at around 6:30 PM, she hired a rickshaw to visit a friend in the French Concession. While traveling along Daji Road, a robber suddenly appeared. He had a long face, wore a white cloth short-sleeved shirt with a turned-down collar, a undershirt underneath, and yellow cloth shorts. He appeared to be in his thirties. He blocked the road and robbed her. The woman was wearing a gold bracelet, about three fen wide, weighing one tael two mace three li, which she had exchanged for at the Sichuan Silver Shop. During the robbery, the woman's right hand was cut open. The victim reported the incident to the police station and requested an arrest.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Man Confirmed to Have Died of Illness</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, early in the morning (the 6th) at 4:15 AM, an unidentified man, about 35 or 36 years old, wearing a Western-style white short-sleeved shirt with a turned-down collar and yellow shorts, suddenly fell to the ground unconscious while passing the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Villemont in the French Concession. A Western police officer saw him, questioned him, but he was unconscious. He immediately reported to the police station and sent him to the hospital. Medical treatment was ineffective. Two hours later, he died. The police station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court was notified. Prosecutor Wang Ren examined the body and determined that he had died of illness. He ordered the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to prepare the body for burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Inspection Report</h3>
<p>The 290th Inspection Report on the Issuance Reserve of Central Bank Exchange Notes states: "In accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Central Bank Law, this committee is responsible for inspecting the number of exchange notes issued by this bank and the reserve fund. The 290th inspection was held at the Issuance Bureau of this bank on July 4, 1936.

<h3>Sales of Tiger Balm Ba Gua Dan Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>Tiger Balm Ba Gua Dan, issued by Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, has been popular for a long time. Currently, sales are increasing, especially during the summer season, because it is needed in various rural areas of the mainland. It is reported that the goods manufactured at the factories in Shantou and other places, as well as those from Hong Kong, are being shipped to Shanghai, but supply is falling short of demand. Therefore, the goods are being quickly sold out. The Shanghai office is constantly telegraphing its factories to urge them to speed up production.</p>
<h3>Career Prospects for Graduates of the Nanyang Wireless Radio School</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Wireless Radio Training School on Beile Road was founded by Liu Ping-shu, a wireless radio expert. Mr. Liu was the earliest and most vigorous advocate of vocational education in wireless radio in China. Therefore, the school's achievements are unmatched. Its equipment has been systematically added to over the past seven years, and its rich collection is rarely seen in private schools. Starting from the previous term, automatic machines were used to train telegraph transmission and reception skills, and student progress was even faster. As for the career prospects of the school's graduates, earlier graduates have spread throughout the provinces and cities. More than 100 are serving in this city. Students from the previous term have been hired by the Ministry of Communications Radio Station, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department Broadcasting Station, and the Central Bank Radio Station. The current students are about to graduate, and various telecommunications agencies are competing to hire them, with special representatives sent to test and recruit them. In view of the urgent needs of the outside world, the school has decided to greatly increase enrollment starting from the next term and will begin accepting new student registrations immediately.</p>

<h3>The Tin Ingot Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Summary of Shanghai Industry and Commerce - 31)</p>
<p>1. Overview</p>
<p>The business nature of the tin ingot industry in this port is to smelt and melt tin ingots and sell them to general tin foil shops and tinware shops. However, there are slight differences between the past and the present. Five or six years ago, due to the light taxation on imported foreign tin, the tin shops in this port mainly sold tin ingots (commonly known as Dutch tin) from Singapore and the South Pacific islands. Later, due to the increase in import tariffs on foreign tin, there was no longer a substantial profit from importing it. As a result, domestic tin from Yunnan and Hunan provinces began to replace it. However, this domestic tin was unmelted. Therefore, the main business of tin shops in this port, in addition to the original transport of foreign tin, also needed to include the melting of domestic tin.</p>
<p>Of the tin ingots sold by tin shops in this port, 70% to 80% are used to make tin foil, and the remainder is used to make utensils and solder. Tin foil is as thin as paper, so the quality of the tin ingots required must be extremely pure. Those who make utensils can use slightly lower-grade tin (containing only 60% pure tin), while solder can be made with varying levels of purity. Imported Dutch tin has excellent quality, containing 99% pure tin, so it is exclusively used to make tin foil. However, it is almost entirely replaced by domestic tin nowadays. Domestic tin is named differently depending on the color after smelting, and its uses also vary. Now, they are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Fu Zu is the best of tin ingots, with a color grade between 99.7 and 8. Currently, it is rarely seen due to the high selling price.</p>
<p>Xiao Hong, also known as Gua Hong tin, is the most common tin ingot on the market, with a color grade of 99.34. Each ingot weighs 75 jin on the Sima scale.</p>
<p>Tong Guang: This tin ingot has an even lower color grade, containing only 50% to 60% pure tin. The remainder is aluminum and impurities, which are made by melting old tinware and tin foil ash.</p>
<p>Gou Guang: Its color is slightly inferior to Bi Guang, but it is still used to make tinware.</p>
<p>Solder: The color varies, but it is also the worst.</p>
<p>In addition, the tin sold on the market also varies in name depending on its source. Now, the main ones are listed below:</p>
<p>Gejiu Tin is named after Gejiu County in Yunnan Province. It has the largest output among domestic products. However, the quality of Gejiu tin itself is inconsistent. The highest common color grade is 99.9, and the lowest is 84.5. Each ingot weighs more than 50 jin on the Sima scale.</p>
<p>Heng Tin is commonly known as Heng Dian and is produced in Hengzhou, Hunan Province. Its color grade ranges from 99.3 to 99.6. Each ingot is rectangular and weighs more than 50 jin on the Sima scale.</p>
<p>Jianghua Tin is produced in Jianghua, Hunan Province. Its color is excellent, at 99.9. It is also rectangular, and each ingot weighs 22-23 jin on the Sima scale.</p>
<p>Linwu Tin is produced in Linwu, Hunan Province. The color is the same as Jianghua tin. Each ingot weighs more than 50 jin on the Sima scale.</p>
<p>Ganzhou Tin is produced in Linwu, Jiangxi Province, with a color grade of around 99. When the ore tin is poured, it is placed in a wok, so it is shaped like a wok. Each ingot weighs more than 50 jin on the Sima scale. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Contribution</p>
<h3>Summer Vacation Student National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, the National Products community and the Education community have joined hands to organize this most valuable undertaking, namely, using students' summer vacations to engage in the National Products Movement, working hard to promote national products, and saving this unprecedented economic national crisis. At the reception for school principals the other day, it was increasingly recognized as a fundamental national salvation effort, and all were willing to do their best to carry it out in earnest. Principal Zheng Tong-he of Shangzhong School, Principal Jia Fo-ru of Zhonghua Vocational School, and Secretary Zhu You-huan of Guanghua University all said that promoting national products is the natural duty of citizens. After returning to school, we will immediately guide students' work and send a circular to students who have returned to their hometowns to do the same. After the start of school, we will also hold a student national products movement achievement exhibition to display the activities of the students during the vacation. Mr. Zheng also contributed two points: Those in leadership positions must first lead by example, use national products, and extend this to relatives and friends, which will surely have a significant effect. It is best to devote more effort to promoting national products in the mainland so that the people in the mainland have the ability to recognize national products. Mr. Huang Ren-zhi said: "Promoting national products is not only for the development of national product manufacturers themselves but also for the entire national product industry and the entire country. Recently, the problem of smuggling has become increasingly serious, and the entire national product industry is on the verge of collapse, and the results are unbearable. In this extraordinary period, all sectors of society must rise up to promote national products and fight for this last chance. I have previously dedicated myself to the education community, and now I am willing to devote my remaining strength to serve the national product community," and so on. The enthusiasm of this energetic Mr. Huang moved everyone present. And the practical actions of the educational leaders, Zheng and Jia, in advocating for students are indeed rare. This summer vacation student national products movement is in line with President Chiang's advocacy of students serving society. I hope that our student community will use this year's summer vacation for this national product movement to save the country and society. Through investigation, persuasion, lectures, organization, exhibitions, research, and reports, we will all work hard for the country with our own blood. If the entire student community can be mobilized to carry out this national product movement to save the country, its great influence and effectiveness will be immeasurable. I know that with enthusiastic and striving principals, there will inevitably be enthusiastic and striving students. With a tireless spirit, we will continue to work, shedding light on the situation and eliminating smuggling. The fate of our national product industry may have a turning point and hope. After this grand meeting, I offer my sincere admiration and wish the success of this year's student national products movement.</p>
<h3>The National Products Movement Needs Three Types of Assistance</h3>
<p>— Cun</p>
<p>The National Products Movement, on the surface, seems to have reached a considerably successful stage. Large factories and large-scale national products companies are springing up one after another, but when we examine the reality, we still feel that it is in its infancy. For example, various important machines must rely on foreign supply, and some raw materials (such as the finest spun yarn, rayon, etc.) are mostly purchased from overseas. The management system of industry and commerce is also a forced imitation of foreign models. Whether it can adapt to the environment and needs of our National Products Movement is still a question worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>The National Products Movement should be practical and suited to the needs of the nation. It should not focus solely on Westernization, as this may hinder the progress of the National Products Movement. So, what are the types of assistance needed for the National Products Movement?</p>
<p>Scientific Assistance: The 20th century is an era of science. A country without science will inevitably decline and even lead to national subjugation. Look at our China, where science is equal to zero. Large-scale undertakings such as electrical engineering, chemical engineering, and machinery manufacturing all rely on foreign countries. Therefore, the National Products Movement must first cultivate great scientists to invent and create all machines, chemical engineering, and other large-scale engineering projects. In this way, the National Products Movement can succeed, and the Republic of China can have a national products nation.</p>
<p>Government Assistance: In addition to cultivating and encouraging scientists, the government should also assist and build large industries. It should make an overall plan for the country, how to resist foreign goods, how to make the National Products Movement successful, create a completely national products nation, and how to be able to promote national products abroad... These are all the responsibilities of the government.</p>
<p>Public Assistance: Now we are being oppressed by imperialism to the point of suffocation, and yet some of the people still promote foreign goods and disregard national products. This is a path to self-destruction. Therefore, the public should wake up, and everyone should not buy foreign goods but completely use national products, so that the national products made by the Chinese people can be enjoyed by the Chinese people themselves.</p>
<p>The above three are related and cannot be separated and carried out independently. The three must advance simultaneously in unity.</p>
<h3>National Products Salesman</h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>We often hear people refer to those who welcome "foreign goods," the "foreign fanatics," as "foreign goods salesmen." As the name suggests, it naturally means that he or she purchases "foreign goods" for everything in daily life: eating, wearing, and using, which is tantamount to helping "foreign goods" shops promote business! How shameful and embarrassing is this?</p>
<p>You must know that a decent Chinese person should use their own good "national products" when they already have them. If they have good "national products" but do not use them and insist on using "foreign goods," this is "self-abandonment"! Self-abandonment is despised by mankind, and even the foreigners who sell you the goods and earn your money cannot help but secretly ridicule you for "not loving your country." Think about it, isn't this embarrassing and the most shameful thing?</p>
<p>Ah! Friends! Now we won't talk nonsense anymore. In short, I hope you will examine yourselves and ask yourselves honestly whether you are a "foreign goods salesman"? If not, then of course you are worthy of our respect, and at the same time, I hope you will work even harder. If you are, then we sincerely advise you to wake up and, from now on, for all daily necessities, as well as those related to eating and wearing, purchase "national products." In other words, we want to advise you to become a "national products salesman." That is glorious! That has face!</p>
<h3>Inserting Tobacco Stems to Resist Rice Borers</h3>
<p>— Sun Lin-chang</p>
<p>My China is known as an agricultural country, and grain is its main product, listed as one of the export commodities. However, in recent years, the facts have shown that the opposite is true. Although this is due to local instability and successive droughts and floods, it is also caused by rice borer infestation. According to expert estimates, the losses caused by rice borers to my country's rice crops amount to tens of millions of yuan annually. The harm of floods does not reach the highlands, and the drought does not reach the lowlands. However, the severity of rice borer infestation makes it possible for the plague to spread to farmland regardless of height.</p>
<p>"Inserting tobacco stems to resist rice borers" has been repeatedly tested and proven effective by the Zhejiang Provincial Entomology Bureau. At the same time, it can promote rice growth and increase production. The method of application is to insert the tobacco stems next to the rice branches about four weeks after transplanting the rice seedlings, one stem per clump. It is even better if two or three replacements can be made before the rice ears emerge. This method is inexpensive, effective, and easy to implement. Now that the season for planting rice seedlings has arrived, farmers in various affected areas may wish to try it and observe the results. Moreover, in recent years, various provinces in my country have produced tobacco leaves. Since tobacco stems can prevent and control rice borers, if they can be widely used throughout the country in the future, it will also be a way to utilize waste and maintain the rural economy.</p>

<h3>The 19th North China Games Canceled</h3>
<p>Most of the Standing Committee Members of the North China Sports Federation Went to Germany, and Provinces and Cities Did Not Agree to Host the Games</p>
<p>(Beiping Special Dispatch) The issue of the location of the 19th North China Games has not been resolved. Beiping cannot host the Games because there is no expanded sports ground. Qingdao, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces and cities cannot host the Games due to economic constraints. As a result, the North China Games cannot be realized this year. Four members of the Standing Committee of the North China Sports Federation, Ma John, Dong Shou-yi, Yuan Dun-li, and Zhao Wen-zao, have gone to Germany to participate in the World Games. Only one member of the Standing Committee, Zhang Bo-ling, remains in the country, and there are few people in charge. Not only will the North China Games be canceled this year, but next year will also be the 7th National Games. The North China Swimming Competition will also be canceled. Whether the Ice Sports Games will be held will be decided after the Standing Committee members return to the country and hold a meeting.</p>

<h3>My Country's Football Team's European Tour</h3>
<p>Written and sent by Team Captain Li Huitang</p>
<p>According to my observations in Medan football, when I first arrived in this land in the early 1920s, their level was quite mediocre. Many players were not good at using their heads. Their immaturity was on par with the Saigon teams at the time. Whenever there was a match, we knew we would win and were never cautious. Unexpectedly, in the past six years, through contact and observation with foreign teams, their skills have improved rapidly, by leaps and bounds. As the saying goes, "A scholar who has been away three days must be looked at with new eyes." Their level has greatly improved, making foreign teams dare not underestimate them. In particular, the progress of Malaysian players is most remarkable. Last year, Nanhua, with an incomplete team, was severely defeated by them. When the news arrived, I initially couldn't believe it. Today, witnessing it firsthand, I know they are indeed extraordinary. Their victory over Nanhua was not a fluke. On the other hand, our country is stuck in its ways, with slow progress in recent years, or even no progress at all. The Medan football team, which we thought was not worth mentioning six years ago, has now followed and caught up, and even has a tendency to overtake us. I think if this continues, they will advance a step, and we will retreat a foot. The future of our country's football is not optimistic. It is most beneficial to invite strong foreign teams to China for matches. I hope the authorities can shoulder this difficult task and realize this hope and work.</p>
<p>Penang Island</p>
<p>After our team defeated all the teams in Medan, we bought a boat at 5 PM on June 17 and set off for Penang Island. Penang Island is a small island in northern Malaysia, about the same size as Hong Kong, facing Medan across a narrow strip of water. The fourteen-hour voyage was not painful. We arrived at the port early in the morning on the 18th. Consul Huang, representatives of overseas Chinese organizations, reporters, and many others came to welcome us, crowding the dock with no space left. We took cars to the Shanghai Hotel to rest. After lunch, we took several cars to the small port of "George Town," fifty miles from Penang Island, to prepare for the afternoon match with the town's selected team. After arriving at the port, we were welcomed by various groups holding meetings. The ceremony was the same as in other places. Director Rong and the reporter expressed their gratitude. At around 5 PM, the following players put on their uniforms and met with the selected team:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Cai Wenli, Mai Shaohan, Liang Shutang, Liang Rongzhao, Zhang Xianyuan, Zheng Jiliang, Tan Jiangbai, Sun Jinshun, Huang Meishun, Yang Shuiyi</p>
<p>The score was 5-0 in the first half and 8-1 at the end. Jiangbai scored twice, Shuiyi scored two, Meishun and Jinshun scored one each. Acting Captain Bao Jiaping. George Town is a small town with a sparse population. The Nanhua team came here once years ago. Although today is unprecedentedly lively, there are less than 3,000 spectators in the entire stadium. The level of football here is also relatively immature. Our team's lineup was not very strong, but it was more than enough. The entire match became our team's world, and the battle was not tense at all. Jiangbai's head and foot kicks, scoring four goals alone, were most praised by the audience. There is nothing else worth mentioning. In the evening, we were treated to a feast. After dinner, we drove back to Penang, arriving at our residence at 11 PM.</p>
<p>(June 19) Today, our team is scheduled to play against the Penang United team. This morning, all the overseas Chinese organizations on the island held a welcome meeting and a flag-presenting ceremony. Consul Huang and representatives from business, academic, and other circles delivered speeches. Director Rong and I were invited to speak successively. After the photo session and tea party, everyone dispersed. The match started at 5 PM. Our team played with the following lineup on the left wing and the result was a 0-0 draw:</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping, Tan Jiangbai, Li Tiansheng, Chen Zhenhe, Xu Yahui, Liang Rongzhao, Zheng Jiliang, Zhuo Shijin, Li Huitang, Sun Jinshun, Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Penang Island's football strength occupies a considerable position in Malaysia. However, the local people, seeing our team's excellent performance in Singapore, believed that the island was no match for us, and some even bet that our team would win by more than four goals. Who knew that things in the world are always unexpected? After a fierce battle, both sides gained nothing, and the match ended in a draw. The reason why their team was able to avoid defeat was half due to the effective defense and half due to luck. Our shots were often decisive, but many hit the goalposts or crossbars and bounced back, failing to break through the goal. The opponent's defense was strict and effective. The central defender stubbornly defended his home, refusing to cross the midline even a step. In addition, our front-line performance was mediocre, and although we launched many attacks, we failed to succeed. In the second half, our side was in danger several times, but fortunately, the defenders were still good, preventing any negligence. Since Feng and Ye, two forwards, were injured in Medan, Jinshun is too fat, Shijin is weak, and Xianyuan is not a forward material, we feel the lack of a sharp blade. If Feng and Ye do not recover soon, there will be many strong enemies in the future, which is a cause for concern for our team's attacking power. After the match, the Penang Football Association welcomed us with refreshments. Director Rong responded in English. After returning to our residence, we packed our luggage and prepared to go to Yangon tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Summer - Women's Health Movement</h3>
<p>Sponsored by Mayor Wu's Wife and Others</p>
<p>Women's health issues are of utmost importance, affecting the family on a small scale and the race on a large scale. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, the country and society need the joint responsibility of women. The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School has this plan to use the summer vacation and existing facilities to make various contributions, which is a new path for women. Yesterday, Mayor Wu's wife and Director Pan's wife convened a new women's movement meeting at Director Pan's residence on Xiangyin Road.

<p>Cihang Vocational School Stops Recruiting</p>
<p>The Cihang Vocational School on Hart Road, Connaught Road, which was only recently established, has been ordered by the Municipal Education Bureau to stop recruiting students because it has not obtained approval to operate.

<h3>Strictly Implementing the System of Full-Time Teachers</h3>

For the past three years, most schools have been able to conscientiously follow this, but there are also many schools that superficially comply but still calculate salaries according to hours, which is contrary to the original intention of this department to implement the full-time teacher system. In view of the previous situation, in addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued to inform the principal of the school that in the future, when hiring teachers, they must strictly comply with the regulations. This order."</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi Discusses the Sino-French Institute of Technology</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Central Committee Member Chu Minyi arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the Sino-French National Institute of Technology. When asked about the recent situation of the school, he gave a very detailed explanation, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>We have been devoted to Sino-French educational and cultural undertakings for many years. Our purpose is to cultivate outstanding young people in our country to become useful talents. The method is to transport the spiritual and material civilization of France to China, and at the same time spread our culture to France, so that the educational and cultural undertakings of these two great countries can be integrated and advanced together. It is because the relationship between China and France is very close, and both countries are republics, and the national characters of the two countries are also very similar. Therefore, the joint development of educational and cultural undertakings is more cordial and convenient than with other countries. Efforts in this regard that have already achieved results include the Franco-Chinese Labor and Diligence Society, presided over by Wu Zhihui and Li Shizeng, and the Sino-French University in Lyon, which have cultivated a large number of talents. The outstanding people among them are scattered in all directions, serving the country and society, and are able to make achievements. Among the educational institutions in China, there is the Sino-French University in Beiping, founded by Mr. Li Shizeng. The only one jointly run by the governments of China and France is our school. Our school was established in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Before that, it was Tongji University, run by Germans. Because of the European War, according to the Treaty of Versailles, all the school property was transferred to the governments of China and France. Therefore, the scale and equipment of our school, all the buildings, machinery and instruments, were mostly left by the Germans, and have already been established. In addition, the machinery and instruments made in France have been managed and operated, and the work has been increasingly effective. Initially, there were two departments of industry and commerce, but now it has been changed to an independent college of engineering. Our college is divided into two departments: university and high school. The university department has four grades, and the high school has three grades. There is also a one-year French language preparatory class, progressing step by step. To graduate, students must undergo eight years of cultivation. By the time they reach the third year of university, they are divided into two departments: civil engineering, railway engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering, so that each can learn according to their interests. Therefore, after graduation, students have gained in-depth knowledge and become industrial specialists who can be self-reliant. Those who rank first in the examination results will be funded by our college to study in France, Belgium, and other countries. In addition, university and high school students with excellent academic performance, who rank in the top four, will also be exempt from tuition fees as a reward. As for tuition fees, the middle school department only charges fifteen yuan per semester, and the university department only charges twenty-five yuan per semester. Accommodation is completely free. If students can be frugal, then a few hundred yuan a year is enough for food, books, and other expenses. Regarding studying abroad, we will pay special attention to it. In the past, we have funded a large number of students to study abroad. There have been two batches funded by our college expenses, each with twenty people. There have been seven people funded by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee. Last year, the Sino-French Education Fund Committee also funded two people to France. Since the 23rd year, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee has subsidized two people to Belgium every year. The previous forty-seven people have all graduated and returned to China, and each has a corresponding task. As for the graduates of previous sessions, those who are in China are also introduced to work by our college, and each gets what they want. This year's graduates include eight from the civil engineering and railway engineering department and six from the mechanical and electrical engineering department. The Department of Railways has organized an examination committee according to the regulations, with one member each from the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Industry, and the Construction Committee, and the French side has sent a committee to take the examination together, to show prudence. Previously, the middle school attached to our college was not part of the joint examination, because it belonged to the nature of a preparatory class for industrial specialties, and the curriculum was slightly different from ordinary high schools. This year, it will also follow the order of the Ministry to participate in the joint examination. As for the internal administration, special attention will be paid to moral education. The management of our college has always been very strict. Starting from the next semester, a military management system will be adopted to militarize school discipline. Regarding equipment, our college has been limited by funds in the past and has not been able to expand as much as possible. Now, with the donation from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, we have purchased a large number of physical and chemical instruments and books from the Academia Sinica to enrich various teaching materials. In short, to the best of our ability, we will spare no effort to promote the bright future of our college and seek the common development of Sino-French educational and cultural undertakings. Recalling the past few decades, this ambition has never changed. In the future, we will continue to work hard based on the established policy and method. This is our duty and cannot be neglected.</p>

The closing prices of No. 34, No. 35, and No. 48 were all bought, the selling pressure eased slightly, and the trend turned firm. Most of them rebounded by about one or two jiaos. The market opened in the afternoon, and the demand for No. 11 was stronger than before, and the market price was squeezed up by another one or two jiaos. At the close, No. 4 was also absorbed, and the transaction was clear, but it was raised by about one or two jiaos. The recent trend is generally not out of the range of hovering, and both sides are watching the situation quietly. Yesterday's market price results mostly rebounded by five cents, one jiao, or half a yuan. The total turnover was 4.22 million yuan. The results of the price increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Longs Exit, Yarn Market Declines and Falls</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation became more chaotic. The market sentiment was still firm, and the market speculators were unusually enthusiastic, so the waves were very large. In fact, the futures yarn has been rising sharply for several days, and the current sales of customers have not yet developed in large quantities, which is somewhat unsatisfactory. It is said that securities firms took profits in the afternoon, and British factories opened 3,000 bales of cotton yarn, which led to a decline and fall.</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn Slid Downstream Step by Step in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, and because Chinese cotton continued to rise, the market was calm, and the months were uneven, up and down by two or three jiaos. The second board continued to weaken. Unexpectedly, at the third closing, Tongji and the bulls came to absorb again. It was rumored that the flour market had not yet opened for auction, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense, and the buying frenzy suddenly rose. Each month jumped up by 1.4 or 5 yuan. As a result, each month rose by 0.3, 7, 8, 9 jiaos to 1.1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon, and the momentum gradually softened, and sellers were lacking. Each month fell by six, seven, or eight jiaos, but later tended to go downstream step by step. This is because the securities gang's bulls came out, and the platform became loose. However, Fengtai came out in the morning and went in in the afternoon. As a result, each month fell by 1.4, 6, or 8 jiaos compared with the morning closing price. Check the sales: Xincheng 1,050 bales, Tonghe 2,000 bales, Mingde 1,050 bales, Chengji 1,750 bales, Zhenda 1,250 bales, Hexing 4,600 bales, Taichang 2,450 bales, Yichang 2,250 bales, Runkang 1,600 bales, Dachang 2,600 bales, Yuan Yi 1,150 bales, Dachangcheng 1,000 bales, Changfeng 2,800 bales, Yongchang 950 bales.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yihuo Factory Opened 3,000 Bales</p>
<p>The current sales of yarn are still good. According to the statistics of the turnover of each gang for the whole day, there were 950 bales, and the selling price rose and fell by 0.25 jiao. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows: It is rumored that Yihuo Factory opened 3,000 bales of 20-count Fufu Shepherd, priced at 210 yuan, minus the full commission, and shipped in August, September, and October.</p>
<h3>Industry Players Tend to Short, Cotton Falls Instead of Rising</h3>
<p>The cotton market started firm and continued to fall, and the market situation was extremely chaotic. This is because the wills of the bulls and bears are inconsistent, but the gold industry is determined to drag in and look good. However, industry players tend to short because the current situation of new cotton is still not bad. It is said that the new cotton was sold off, the bulls closed and turned down.</p>
<p>Securities Firms' Longs Have Been Filed</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning, and after several days of continuous rise, those with weak forces had already cleared up, so although the US cotton call was good, with 11 pounds of sound, and Indian cotton rose by 0.5 to 1 rupee, the market was calm. Old cotton rose slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao, and new cotton fell by 0.1 to 0.2 jiao. The second board was flat. The third board suddenly jumped wildly. It was rumored that the flour and wheat were looking good, and the exchange was suspended. Then the buying frenzy suddenly intensified, and each month jumped by 0.3 or 0.4 jiao. The closing was slightly flat. As a result, old cotton rose by 0.15 to 0.35 jiao, and new cotton did not move. The market opened in the afternoon, and the market situation turned depressed. Because of the large amount of filings from securities firms, and the sale of new cotton, the market sentiment was suppressed, and the market fell step by step. As a result, each month fell by 0.2 to 0.4 or 0.5 jiaos compared with the morning closing price. Check the sales: Yuanxingchang 6,000 dan, Xinchang 2,200 dan, Shengyuan 1,800 dan, Yichang 1,200 dan, Renfeng 4,400 dan, Hengde 1,800 dan, Changyu 1,600 dan, Dafeng 2,300 dan, Yuda 1,400 dan, Dafu 5,400 dan, Mingde 2,400 dan, Hexing 5,000 dan, Dachang 1,800 dan. Purchases: Tongji 11,700 dan, Juxing 6,800 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Jinchang 2,400 dan, Mingde 2,900 dan, Yuan Yi 3,000 dan, Changfeng 3,300 dan, Tonghe 5,800 dan, Xincheng 4,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>New Cotton Sales Have Already Started</p>
<p>The current cotton consumption is mediocre, but the new cotton industry has already started selling off. It is said that Japanese merchants have absorbed 220 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<h3>Rain in US Cotton Drought Areas, Market Still Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market situation was active. Each month rose by six to nine pounds of sound. The Liverpool news was good, and industry players, brokers, and foreign merchants all bought in unison. The textile market was active, and spot goods were tight. The cotton field estimates were flat, and the wheat market was strong, all of which were the reasons for the market price to rise. It is estimated that when the cotton hoarding was at 1.18 yuan, 20,000 bales of the October contract were sold. According to the Texas news, the rain was beneficial, and the cotton harvest was good, but industry players did not pay attention. The closing was firm. Spot goods rose by 13 pounds of sound, and futures rose by 11 to 15 pounds of sound. British cotton spot goods did not move, and futures rose and fell by one to three points. Indian cotton bulls closed, and were absorbed by Japanese merchants. The Pingguoer rose and fell by 0.25 to 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and Bailuo Creek rose by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuo Creek cotton for the April-May period on the 7th was 216.5 rupees, an increase of half a rupee compared to the closing of the previous day.</p>
<p>Last Week's Rangoon Cotton Exports</p>
<p>Mumbai telegram, 6th, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 18 tons, all to Liverpool.</p>
<p>Three-Product Yarn Flat, Cotton Firm</p>
<p>Osaka telegram, 7th, the three-product futures yarn rose and fell by 0.1 to 0.9 jiao. The near month was 205.6 yuan, and the far month was 201.1 yuan. Futures cotton rose by 0.15 to 0.4 jiao. The near month was 68 yuan, and the far month was 63.45 yuan.</p>

<h3>Grain: Source of Tin Arrives Booming, Futures Wheat Suddenly Drops in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Large Numbers of Bulls Selling</p>
<p>A Drop of 2.1 Jiao This Month</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, each month showed a near-flat and far-rising phenomenon. Judging from the current situation, although the quoted price of foreign wheat is still as high as 1.56 yuan, the domestic market is in the peak of new wheat coming on the market, and the harvest is more abundant than in previous years. People's hearts are flourishing, and most of them are caused by speculation. Once the matter passes, it is easy to produce a reaction. In July and August, because the factories did not move, and it was rumored that the current wheat was going to be dull, the market sentiment had softened, and was smaller than the previous day by 0.3, 4, or 5 cents. The first part of September was also calm, but later, because the industry absorbed again, the market rose again, and September and October rose by as much as 7 or 8 cents. November and December were better by 3 or 5 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market suddenly changed drastically, and the degree of decline was very high. This is because each factory did not only intend to pack in eastern cars, and it was heard that the source of Wuxi is currently very smooth, with a number of 30,000 to 50,000 packs per day. The market went down by 0.1 jiao, so people's hearts shook, and large numbers of bulls sold off. The degree of decline in the near term reached 2.1 jiao, and the rest all reached about 0.1 jiao. This kind of situation is really not accidental, because the current chemical industry is not good, and it has to decline. As for the current wheat in the city, only more than 1,000 packs of ship wheat were opened, from 4.2 yuan to 4.04 yuan. Observing the next step, it is feared that there is still a trend to continue falling.</p>
<p>The US wheat market situation, due to the possibility of hedging and selling, the large amount of harvest in the southwest, the increase in supply, and the panic of the buyer's excessive chips, are all reports of crop damage, hot weather, and the fear of worsening the wheat drought, which have not been improved. The estimated increase in the visible supply of US wheat is 2,728,000 barrels. The estimated decrease in the visible supply of Canadian wheat is 2,379,000 barrels. The estimated increase in the visible supply of corn is 248,000 barrels.</p>
<h3>Flour Exchange Did Not Open for Auction Yesterday Due to Sorting Out Accounts</h3>
<p>The flour exchange, because the transaction the day before was exceptionally smooth, and the total number reached 3.56 million packs, the closing was very cramped, and the collection of evidence funds could not be done at one time, so the accounts were settled all day, and the rumors of sorting out the buying and selling markets were all unfounded. Because the rise and fall of the market is a common thing for the exchange, but the extreme rise and fall will inevitably attract the attention of people inside and outside the industry.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans Arrive</h3>
<p>2.35 Yuan Higher Than Last Year</p>
<p>The new soybeans came on the market quite early this year. Yesterday, the first batch of Wenzhou goods arrived. 20 packs were transported by Xinruiping. The goods were still good, but because they were rushing to be new, they were only 60% to 70% dry. They were divided by the retail vegetable vendors on the street. The price was 6.2 jiao, and the market price was compared with the first price last year (July 16), "3.85 yuan," an increase of 2.35 yuan. At that time, the market was stable, not as sharp as this year's goods. The disposal of old soybeans, the oil mills are still continuing, and 4 cars of Siping Street beans, 2,200 packs of Luohe beans, and 340 packs of Zhumadian Xinyangzhou beans were traded. Also, the black beans of Niuzhuang car, the market situation is stable, and there is no change for the time being.</p>
<h3>Source Too Strong, Passenger Rice Fell by About 0.1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's passenger rice market saw a downward trend again, because the arrival of the head in the past two days was booming. After the weather turned clear, the number of each road became more surging, and fearing that the hot weather would affect it, the four vendors were mostly seeking late. Although the transaction yesterday was lively, in the end the source was too strong, and people's hearts were all trending down. The transaction was also due to the fact that the cargo owner depreciated the price. The inland gang took the opportunity to pick up more than 2,000 packs of low-priced rice, and the local market's appetite was also fragrant. The total transaction for the day was 4,563 packs of Jiangxi rice, 60 packs of Xiang rice, 300 packs of Wu rice, 320 packs of Jiangbei Zhenjiang rice, 280 packs of Hanji rice, and 50 packs of Shaoxing rough late rice. The market prices were all about 0.1 jiao lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Display Considerable Enthusiasm</h3>
<p>Artificial Silk Marked for Several Dozen Cases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York silk market suddenly surged. Prices for all grades of silk products and spot futures were up five points higher than last Saturday. Yokohama silk prices also strengthened accordingly. Spot sales opened eighteen yuan higher than the previous day, futures thirteen yuan higher, but by the afternoon, prices had fallen back by about twenty yuan. The Lyon silk market appeared rather stagnant, with prices for Chinese and Japanese raw silk remaining unchanged. The Shanghai silk market seems to be showing enthusiasm again. Apart from some selling by foreign firms, user demand for silk goods is very firm, and sentiment is mostly bullish, so domestic hoarders are also actively buying. The foreign firms' silk market, on the other hand, appears to be struggling.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Market Situation: Eighty-six cases of "Heavenly Altar Beauty" brand, number 120, previously shipped from North China, were marked for sale by the customs there. They were purchased jointly by four local firms. The firms offered 195 yuan, selling twenty cases. Ninety cases of "Tianqiao" brand, number 120, also shipped from North China and marked for sale by customs, have already been sold. The firms offered 445 yuan, selling over thirty cases.</p>
<p>Sales of European goods are weakening, as the market is flooded with Japanese goods marked for sale by customs from various locations. Next Tuesday, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs will hold a tender for a total of 26,260 pounds.</p>
<h3>First Month of New Cocoons: Silk Export Report</h3>
<p>August 1st… Commencement of Raw Silk Quality Inspection</p>
<p>New Cocoons Next Year… Implementation of Raw Silk Grading Inspection</p>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in June, silk exports totaled 2,459 bales of white filature silk, 268 bales of other silks, and 1,215 bales of waste silk, for a total of 3,942 bales. This is slightly less than the 4,798 bales in the same month last year. However, this month marks the beginning of the new cocoon season. During this month, silk merchants are actively purchasing spring cocoons and preparing factory sites, making them quite busy. Market transactions mostly involve discarding old stock and adopting new. Spot exports are necessarily fewer. According to a recent survey, after the arrival of the spring cocoons, silk factories that have started operations include over twenty in Wuxi, twenty-five in various parts of Zhejiang, and forty-two in Shanghai, totaling over eighty. The atmosphere is quite vibrant. Furthermore, since being ordered by the Ministry in March to prepare for raw silk quality inspection, the local Commodity Inspection Bureau has been ordering various new types of inspection machinery and instruments from home and abroad, recruiting and training technical personnel, and actively preparing. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on July 1st, but due to the time-consuming nature of machinery installation, approval has been obtained from the Ministry to officially implement it on August 1st. The Bureau also convened a conference of silk industry representatives from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Shandong on June 22nd to solicit opinions from all parties, in order to pool ideas and benefit from collective wisdom. The silk industry representatives present expressed their support for the government's handling of raw silk quality inspection, in order to save the silk industry. The conference also decided to implement raw silk grading inspection after the arrival of the new cocoons next year. This one-year preparation period is to allow government and businesses to study proper measures to ensure timely implementation, it is said.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Shigandang)</p>
<p>Stones on high mountains often easily fall into deep valleys.</p>
<p>Flowers that bloom profusely are not far from withering.</p>
<p>The silkworm's self-imposed cocoon is very worthy of praise, because it "secludes itself to cultivate," preparing to create a new life—a moth.</p>
<p>Filming movies relies on expressions; the better the expressions, the more they demonstrate the actor's superb skills. However, this is not the case in how people conduct themselves in the world. It is best to have no expression. For example, when one is angry inside, one still talks and laughs as usual on the surface, or when one is happy inside, one still acts as if nothing is happening. In short, one should not let anyone see one's joys, angers, sorrows, or pleasures on one's face. Showing deep expressions over trivial matters is not suitable for modern society.</p>
<h3>Deep in the Mountains and Lakes</h3>
<p>— Lake Beggar</p>
<p>To appreciate the scenery of Qiantang, one must ascend to Five Clouds and reach the ends of Heaven's Gate to truly grasp the subtle charm of the mountains and lakes. The Six Bridges and Two Embankments only offer its clarity, while the Dragon Well and Lingyin Temple merely capture its serenity. To seek a combination of grandeur and elegance, depth and vastness, one must ascend through the clouds and mist to faintly discern it. Most tourists in Hangzhou merely skim the surface while boating or take a brief, shallow climb, already feeling satisfied. Who understands that the natural beauty lies beyond the lightly adorned West Lake? Starting from the riverbank, one walks leisurely along the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road, embracing the shimmering waves on the left and swallowing the misty shadows on the right. The wind's murmur is still, as if the tongue and nose are expanding and contracting with the universe. As the morning sun gradually unfolds, the splashing water sprouts dark purple scales, incomparably beautiful. The fishing boats and sails are waiting for the tide to rise, as serene as newly molted frogs. Passing the Nine Dragon Heads, one reaches Fancun, where silk willows brush against one's chest, their green eyes gleaming. The village was once the place where Grand Master Lianchi resided. The homes in the small market are serene and elegant. Heading west, one traverses slopes and fields, entering the foothills, where dense shade blocks the sunlight. Though the sun's rays may be directly overhead outside the mountain, here, startled birds are just now chirping once or twice. Further ahead lies the Cloud Dwelling Bamboo Path, where tens of thousands of jade-green bamboos rub against each other on both sides, making a clear, ringing sound. Bamboo powder like snow covers the ground, making one's footsteps crystalline. Many of the bamboo tips have inscriptions, proclaiming someone's act of releasing captive animals, showing the devoutness of these men and women. It is laughable. Following the left path, one ascends along the cliff, which is Five Clouds. Initially, the stone steps are smooth and even, but after three hundred steps, one gradually falters. One rests and climbs, looking down into bottomless space. All one sees is the midday smoke of ancient temples, thinly rising above the pine trees. The wind rolls it, often combining two, three, or even dozens of wisps at the top, while those extending from the gaps in the trees continue to rise, never ceasing. This scene is difficult to describe. On the mountain ridge is a pavilion called Lin Hai, from which one can overlook the Qiantang River. The rising water vapor only reveals a faint outline. Climbing further, the path becomes narrow and without steps, with wild vines helping one's hands and feet, yet one still fears exhaustion. After catching one's breath and sweating for about half an hour, one finally reaches Xingji Temple. The temple sits atop the mountain, open and unobstructed on all sides, with only one old tree in front of the gate, making the sound of raging waves on its own. The Buddhist fire is dim and cold, and the monk is lean and refined. Talking with him about the temple's history, the conversation transcends the Six Dynasties. Circling the Five Clouds Pavilion, one ascends even more desolate hills, pushing through grass and stepping carefully, not following the woodcutter's path. Passing Tea Leaf Mountain and Myriad Years Ridge, besides the sounds of wind and trees, one also hears the rhythmic songs of tea-picking girls, expressing their affection and not avoiding sensual themes, like a scene from ancient times. Descending Langdang Ridge, ten miles of lush greenery, one feels birds at one's armpits, suddenly understanding the story of Liezi riding the wind. At the end of the ridge, one touches the Lion Peak, which is not as high as Five Clouds, but more precipitous. At its summit, a stone stands upright, impossible for ordinary people to climb. Looking at Heaven's Gate, it still stands tall in the clouds. One walks with one's arms, fearing to fall in the wind. The chaotic peaks below are colored yellow and purple, vying for beauty, as the setting sun at one's feet conjures afterglows. Reaching Hugong Ridge, clouds seal the peaks, woodcutters and gatherers are nowhere to be seen. One hurries through the empty valley, startling birds with one's steps. Helpless, one seeks lodging at the Dragon Well Temple. All night, the sound of the stream answers the chime of bells and musical stones. One wonders if one has already entered another life.</p>
<h3>Plain Boiled Water</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Hygienists don't drink tea or coffee; they only quench their thirst with plain boiled water. It is said that tea and coffee stimulate the nerves, while only by drinking plain boiled water can one quote classics and expound great principles, winning people's nods of approval and applause.</p>
<p>To people accustomed to drinking tea and coffee, plain boiled water always feels bland and tasteless, lacking the appeal of tea and coffee. However, a friend of mine who is used to drinking plain boiled water says, "Plain boiled water is like a simple country girl who doesn't understand worldly affairs. Naturally, she doesn't know anything about applying rouge and wearing high heels, nor does she know that there is such a thing as 'love' between men and women. But only such a naive and unpretentious woman is worthy of love. Loving women in pleasure quarters may seem intoxicating, but those who can intoxicate you can also cause you extreme sorrow, because the love of such women is mixed with ulterior motives, just as tea and coffee are not the original flavor. To seek the original flavor, one must experience it in plain boiled water."</p>
<p>Although this friend's theory is somewhat distorted, upon calm reflection, it is undeniable. A relative of mine once passionately loved a dancer, and they mutually promised to marry. He forced his parents to break off his engagement with his fiancée in the countryside and cohabited with the dancer. However, after cohabitation, the dancer, being accustomed to extravagance, could not restrain her spending, causing him severe financial strain. At the same time, the dancer, accustomed to the life of red lights and green wine, was not used to settling down as a young mistress. Due to occasional arguments, the couple clashed. Then, the dancer initiated a lawsuit for divorce. After this experience, my relative suddenly awoke and re-engaged a matchmaker to propose to the former fiancée's family and remarry. This happened four years ago, and they have two children. His wife still treats him with the same sincerity and respect as at the beginning of their marriage, and both are very satisfied.</p>
<p>I think plain boiled water may indeed be more meaningful than tea and coffee.</p>
<h3>The Transposed Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Fine Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces; Quiet Night, Alone Writing a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>As he sat down to calm himself, he couldn't help but reach into his pocket and pull out the letter. He divided the three sheets of paper into two parts. First, he folded two sheets and put them back in the envelope, leaving one sheet to hold in his hands and read. He put the other envelope in the desk drawer, blocking the drawer's opening as if someone were about to open it and snatch the letter. He read all three sheets of paper one by one, and finally, he tapped the table lightly, made up his mind again, quickly put the letter away, and then leaned over the table to write a letter. But after writing only one side, he suddenly remembered something else, immediately stood up, covered the written sheet with a stack of blank paper, then pulled out two of his favorite magazines from the bookshelf, placed them on the table, and casually flipped through them, finding a novel written by Zhang Litian and reading it twice. One of the translated novels had the following dialogue:</p>
<p>Lina, tell me honestly, don't you love me? I love you, and you love me. Besides this, what other requirements are there for the union of a man and a woman? What I mean by union is not necessarily marriage, but simply that in this world, we two are the most in love, and each gains a kind of spiritual comfort. At least one can believe that in the universe, besides oneself, there are others who are not completely irrelevant. As for formal union, it is difficult to satisfy everyone's wishes, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't. What I seek is someone in the universe whom I respect and love, and to whom I can entrust my life's faith. If you don't love me, I will think the same. If you love me, then my love for you will be even stronger. But you keep your love for me hidden in your heart, not letting me know. I truly cannot understand why. If you say that you know I love you, and it might be detrimental to me, then you can endure it. That is still understandable. But you know it, and I already know that you love me. If you could just say one word of love, I would transform into a heavenly horse, born to fly into the sky…"</p>
<p>After reading it, Menglan closed the book, propped her head with both hands, and stared blankly at the lamp. She opened the book again and read it again. She couldn't help but nod twice. The solitary lamp standing quietly at that moment also grew brighter, because it illuminated the person sitting opposite it, and many smiles had appeared on her face. She put the magazines back on the bookshelf. She pulled out the sheet of paper she had written and tore it to pieces. All of it was thrown into the spittoon. She said to herself, "Just ignore it. Why reply to the letter?" So she extracted Guoshi's letter for the third time, and read it for the third time. After half an hour, she could almost recite the words in the letter. She snorted to herself, spread out the paper for the third time, and began to write again. This time it wasn't as difficult as writing the previous sheet. The familiar words in the letter, as well as the dialogue in that novel, evoked many contrasting thoughts. Without pausing, she wrote three sheets of paper in one breath. (45)</p>
<h3>Hot Chitchat</h3>
<p>— Rongyu</p>
<p>"A calm heart brings natural coolness" is a comforting lie. People working under the scorching sun, no matter how calm their hearts are, won't stop complaining about the heat. Conversely, people sitting in air-conditioned rooms, chewing on colorful ice cream, won't break a sweat no matter how wildly they think.</p>
<p>The song sung by the White Day Rat in the Water Margin's "Capturing the Birthday Presents Intelligently" is truly filled with tears of heat and a sense of injustice. I wonder how many people who read it can appreciate its meaning. The poem says: "The red sun scorches like fire, the rice in the fields is half withered. The farmer's heart is like boiling soup; the sons of nobles wave their fans." Luckily, this poem was written by someone from a previous generation. If it were written by a modern person, it would definitely have a "proletarian" writer's title added to it.</p>
<p>In the "Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations," it says: "A scholar lived in a small, cramped room facing west. During the hot summer afternoons, the sun would shine so intensely that he would become mentally disturbed and wished he could burn the house down. One day, he took a nap in the room and dreamed that he was captured by the King of Hell and subjected to the torture of knife mountains and boiling cauldrons, suffering unbearably. He also dreamed of sailing on the sea, where the waves were turbulent. Soon, the waves capsized the boat, and he was drowning. He woke up in great fear and realized that he had not been tortured or shipwrecked. Feeling at ease, he felt cool all over. At this moment, he looked at the narrow room and the cramped bed and thought they were more comfortable than jade palaces!" This passage carries some philosophy. "A hungry person readily takes food, a thirsty person readily takes drink" – this is the same principle, and heat is no exception.</p>
<p>Cold news: "Ice Cream Manufacturing Methods" is the work of expert experience. The contents detail the manufacturing process of various colors and flavors of ice cream, as well as its relationship with human health. The writing is concise and clear. The entire book has eight chapters, about seventy pages in length. The manufacturing method is simple and easy, possible for everyone. The price is two dimes per copy. Readers can write to Shanghai Post Office Box 1737. We were honored to receive two copies yesterday and are introducing it here.</p>
<h3>Water and Milk Blend?</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Record of What Was Seen</h3>
<p>— (Wu Jiren)</p>
<p>Leaning over the goldfish bowl, I watched the many young fish of this year, seeing them grow day by day. From their tiny, needle-like bodies, one could see the red marks of the bloodworms they had eaten in their bellies. The abdomen of the small fish, in fact the entire body, was gradually developing. As the saying goes, "Growing longer by the day and bigger by the night," I also say this about goldfish.</p>
<p>However, while the small fish themselves are growing, a kind of harmful insect, the "gill worm," also eats the small fish and grows even faster. At first, when setting up the bowl, weren't water plants added? Those tiny "gill worms" invisible to the naked eye had already been brought into the bowl with the water plants. Every day, I saw many small fish floating on the surface of the bowl with their tails dead, some with their heads and bodies separated, and some with their heads and tails missing. This was entirely due to the gill worms.</p>
<p>Grown gill worms are over an inch long, completely like "shrimp," except they have no antennae on their heads, and their heads are flat. A pair of pincers is near their mouths. The small fish have no chance once they are caught by them. Therefore, the gill worms in the fish bowl must be caught quickly, otherwise, the entire bowl of fish will be killed by them.</p>
<p>Also, the growth of several thousand small fish will not be uniform. After a month and a half, some are already very large, while others are still very tiny. At this time, as soon as the water fleas in the bowl are eaten, the large fish will eat the small fish. Such tragic scenes of infighting will occur frequently. If discovered, the large ones must immediately be caught and raised separately.</p>
<p>In-fighting, the weak being the prey of the strong, this is the law of natural selection. Goldfish still have humans to kill the harmful insects. What about humans, the most intelligent of all creatures? They are pitiful enough.</p>

<h3>Early Summer in the Inner Garden</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>"Excuse me, please stop for a moment!" It was still the man dragging the old poet, raising his hand and shouting.</p>
<p>"Why stop for a moment?" The person with the purplish-red face, pushing the copper basin hat on his forehead, said.</p>
<p>"We want to take pictures." The man raising his hand sounded like he was begging for forgiveness.</p>
<p>"Take pictures of your mother! What's it got to do with the old man? This isn't your home!" The person with the purplish-red face rolled his eyes and pushed the man aside, heading straight into the gap in the circle. He sneered, "What a joke! You're allowed to take pictures! We're not allowed to walk! Do you understand? This is everyone's garden..."</p>
<p>A huge round of applause erupted from all directions. The lines of people who had been squinting and making a circle to watch the excitement were broken up by these words and gradually became chaotic. The man and woman who were taking pictures also mingled in the commotion and bitterly drilled through the hole. I immediately turned to look at the old poet, wanting to subtly seek his opinion on this matter with a look of doubt. The old poet smiled at me and said:</p>
<p>"Isn't this a pretty good photo? Let's go. It's going to rain!"</p>
<p>I raised my eyes to the low sky and saw that the gray, decadent clouds had already dissipated, revealing a single scale of sunlight leaking from the gaps in the leaves. I had to foolishly ask:</p>
<p>"It won't rain; the weather is turning for the better!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Who knows? Do you dare to decide that there won't be piercing pain following extreme joy?"</p>
<p>That iron-like quiet word proved its value half a cigarette later. What reason could I still use to justify it? I could only slowly help him go home. The evening sun was excellent, but in the warm breeze, I don't know from where, thin threads of rain were sent--this was the sign of early summer. (The End)</p>

<h3>Infectious Venereal Diseases, i.e., Sexually Transmitted Diseases (4th Continuation)</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>—"Gonorrhea"—</p>
<p>Little did they know that delaying for a day or two would cause the swelling of the external urethra to suddenly and rapidly worsen, with the foreskin also becoming swollen and edematous, and a milky white secretion would flow out from time to time. From this, the secretion gradually flowed more thickly, eventually becoming a yellowish-green paste. At the same time, the back of the penis would be painful, the urine stream would shrink, urination would become frequent, and urination would initially be turbid, then intermittent and dribbling, with unbearable stinging pain! The physical and mental suffering was simply unbearable. These are the symptoms of acute gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Almost all people who contract gonorrhea often do not rush to seek treatment in the first two or three days. Only when the disease suddenly worsens and the pain becomes severe do they seek medical treatment in a panic, at a loss for what to do amidst the combined attack of pain and anxiety. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Rapid and Thorough Root Treatment for Turbidity</h3>
<p>The treatment period for gonorrhea used to require six weeks. This was a source of anxiety and impatience for patients. This was due to the selection of medication, where there was much to consider. Since the recent invention of the internal "Anti-Gonorrhea" yellow pigment preparation, a special medicine for eliminating turbidity and destroying gonorrhea, the treatment period no longer needs to be so long due to its majestic medicinal power and remarkable efficacy. For example, a patient came to me last month complaining of acute gonorrhea that had been misdiagnosed by cheap, inferior drugs and was untreatable. After taking "Anti-Gonorrhea," the inflammation and pain subsided, and the urine became clear and free of turbidity in less than three weeks, rapidly restoring his health, and his vitality was also revived.</p>
<h3>Secret Treatment for Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Liu Zhimin</p>
<p>The number of young men and women suffering from nocturnal emission is truly countless. If we were to examine it from a medical perspective, then those whose condition was caused by masturbation would account for more than 80% of cases. Although some may also ejaculate due to physiological reasons, there are particularly many people whose neuroticism is caused by pathological nocturnal emission. It can truly be said that "it's a common sight." In short, whether it's nocturnal emission due to physiological reasons or pathological reasons, it is the most terrible condition for rapidly depleting a person's energy. In young men and women, it can cause neuroticism to break out in a short period of time, not only severely affecting your career but also hastening the danger to your life.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to provide you with some knowledge about self-treatment, which I am sure you will welcome, without a doubt. However, we must first recognize that nocturnal emission caused by masturbation is purely due to excessive physical depletion, resulting in loose seminal valves. With the slightest sensation, or even without sensation, emission occurs. The danger of the condition can thus be known.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step in self-treatment is to secure the seminal valve and seek "Hemitotus Firming Pills," which have the effect of treating nocturnal emission. Then, supplement with "Reproductive Element" to nourish the depleted function. By using this two-pronged approach, one can guarantee a permanent solution and prevent recurrence.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Bone Pain and Muscle Numbness</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The condition of joint pain has various pathological changes. If thorough treatment is not given, it often causes muscle soreness and numbness, and tendon cramping. Severely, it can cause numbness in the limbs, hemiplegia, and paralysis.</p>
<p>The treatment for this condition cannot be accomplished simply by dispelling wind and removing dampness. This is because the patient's blood is impure, residual toxins have not been cleared, there is too much uric acid, and the blood vessels are hardening. How can it be cured radically if treatment does not take all of these factors into account?</p>
<p>The famous medicine "John Stone's Bone Pain Pills" has pure and good medicinal properties and comprehensive efficacy. It can be used to treat the above-mentioned pathological changes, addressing all aspects. Moreover, its medicinal properties are suitable for the constitution of Chinese people, so the effects are seen more quickly after taking it. Recently, I used it to cure Mr. Lin's chronic limb numbness, and it took less than a month. He said that the effects were much better than other similar medications.</p>
<h3>Irregular Menstruation and Breast Atrophy</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The most important gland in the human body is the reproductive gland. It is extremely important for health, pathogenesis, youth, and longevity. For example, if women lack reproductive gland hormones, it will cause irregular menstruation, cold uterus and abdominal pain, miscarriage and infertility, breast atrophy, etc., resulting in loss of health and beauty, illness, and premature aging. The importance of reproductive gland hormones is such as this.</p>
<p>Last month, Mrs. Jiang came to consult me, complaining that her menstruation was always irregular. Prolonged and untreated, it caused leukorrhea, abdominal pain, and other symptoms. It also caused her to lose the original beauty of her full breasts. After diagnosing and prescribing medication according to her symptoms, I instructed her to purchase "Female Reproductive Element" for internal use and "Leukorrhea Cure" for external use from Wuzhou Pharmacy and use them simultaneously. In less than a month, her menstruation became regular, the inflammation subsided, and the leukorrhea disappeared. Her body also regained its health, and her breasts regained their fullness, fully expressing the youth and beauty that a young woman should have, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rescue from Long-Term Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Min, is 48 years old and from Jiangxi. He has been doing business in Shanghai for many years. In his early years, he injured his stomach from playing and eating as a joke with friends. His cardia and pylorus were both damaged, causing him to suffer from constant pain. When it was severe, he would even faint and lose consciousness. Although he had purchased and taken stomach medicines, they only had a temporary effect and could not cure the root cause. He thought that it was incurable and had put it off until now. In mid-April of this year, he saw his close friend, Mr. Li, suffering from the same stomach condition being cured by me. He then came to me for treatment. To treat the root cause, I instructed him to purchase "Stomach Pain Reliever" and "Stomach Tonic" from Zhongying Pharmacy and take them together. With the source of the pain removed, the stomach immediately recovered. From then on, he deeply guarded against repeating his past mistakes and strictly followed my instructions for maintenance, it is said.</p>
<h3>Premature Aging Reverses to Youthful Vigor</h3>
<p>Mr. Shao from [location] writes: I am currently thirty-six years old. Two months ago, everyone assumed I was between forty-five and forty-six. My complexion was sallow, wrinkles crisscrossed my face, and my appearance was that of someone approaching old age. Furthermore, I suffered from lower back pain, dizziness, blurred vision, forgetfulness, insomnia, fatigue, and aversion to exertion, resembling a frail and sickly body. The cause was complex, but mainly due to malnutrition and imbalances after illness. Later, I consulted Dr. Wu Dachao for diagnosis and treatment. He determined that I had a deficiency of gonadotropin, leading to neurasthenia. He prescribed "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素), a gonadotropin preparation from Wing On Company. I followed his instructions and took four boxes in succession, and the results were remarkable. My skin regained elasticity, wrinkles disappeared, my blood and energy were replenished, my complexion became rosy, my body became strong and healthy, my lower back became strong, my muscles developed, and my spirit became vigorous, making me look like a young man of twenty-seven or twenty-eight. Alas, "Sheng Zhi Su" is indeed the supreme savior for patients suffering from weakness.</p>
<h3>Pathological Queries (Letters of inquiry must include detailed address and return postage)</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea Recurrence</p>
<p>Last spring, I contracted gonorrhea after a night of indulgence. I was treated and cured with medication. Having experienced the pain firsthand, I dare not engage in such pleasures again, so there is no reason for reinfection. Therefore, I have three questions I would like answered:</p>
<p>1.  If gonorrhea is left untreated, is there a danger?</p>
<p>2.  What treatment can completely eradicate it?</p>
<p>3.  Please explain in detail the cause of the current recurrence.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>1.  You should seek prompt diagnosis and treatment for complete eradication, otherwise there is a risk of orchitis or nephritis.</p>
<p>2.  "An Di Lin" (安敵淋) offers the best chance of a complete cure. It can be purchased from Chinese and Western pharmacies.</p>
<p>Prevention of Lung Disease</p>
<p>I have consulted many well-known lung disease experts, and they believe that the only effective way to eliminate lung disease is through prevention. Their reasoning is: "There are no reliable medications for treating lung disease, so prevention is the only option." Therefore, I am particularly concerned and would like to discuss the following:</p>
<p>1.  What are the methods of prevention?</p>
<p>2.  Are there any preventive medications for lung disease available for sale?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>1.  In addition to strengthening the body, the best way to prevent lung disease is to minimize contact with lung disease patients. Strengthening the body allows it to resist the invasion of tubercle bacilli. Even if tubercle bacilli enter the body, a strong immune system will naturally eliminate them.</p>
<p>2.  Taking "Sheng Zhi Su" (生殖素) to strengthen the body is beneficial for preventing lung disease. Regular consumption can effectively rejuvenate the body, ensuring that lung disease will never affect you. This is the most meaningful experience in preventing lung disease.</p>

<h3>Dog Hairdressing Company</h3>
<p>— Yun Hai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bund is truly full of wonders. Not to mention anything else, just taking "dogs" as an example, there are so many variations. The dog racing track uses dogs as a joke, providing gambling entertainment for gentlemen, and dog doctors specialize in treating foreign dogs for various difficult and complicated ailments like colds and coughs, which have now become commonplace. Not long ago, there was also a new trend, which was the dog restaurant, specially opened for our Chinese and foreign dog-owning class of dog gentlemen and ladies, to "patronize our store," with attentive service, doing whatever they want. In the past, it was rare to see dogs sitting in cars, enjoying the breeze with electric fans; now it is not so foolish, even if you see dog gentlemen and dog ladies eating in dog restaurants that are better than people's restaurants, you will not be surprised by that solemn gentlemanly posture. This is also a sign of urban prosperity.</p>
<p>Now some people are worried about the "hairdressing" problems of dog gentlemen and dog ladies. According to a special report from a certain newspaper, dog hairdressing companies (Cut Dogs Hamr Co.) have been found successively on Yidingpan Road and Lafayette Road, specializing in cutting and shaving dog hair for the dog-owning class. These companies are like barber shops, with various styles and prices ranging from one and a half yuan, two yuan, four yuan, with five yuan being the highest. Cutting takes twenty minutes. The dog feels no pain during cutting. It is said that since these dog hairdressing companies opened, many dog owners have gone to do business, and the business seems to be very good.</p>
<p>Gentlemen seem to have a special fondness for "livestock." A long time ago, we heard about the organization of "animal protection associations," and they issued orders to restrict and even prohibit the ugly abuse of "livestock." However, we have never heard anyone say that they want to organize "poor people protection associations" or "unemployed protection associations." This shows that gentlemen's "livestock" are also "uniquely blessed and without fault." According to this logic, it is not unreasonable for dog hairdressing companies to give preferential treatment to "dogs." Although some poor people cannot get their hair cut even once a year, the "livestock" of noble gentlemen get a haircut, and the minimum price is half a foreign dollar. Looking at it this way, it seems to be too generous to dogs and too stingy to "poor people." However, as long as we fundamentally understand that this social system is not generous to "poor people," but on the contrary exploits them, then we can be "relieved."</p>
<h3>Visit to the Baoan Nursing Home</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) The second branch of the Baoan Nursing Home in Jiangyuan Lane in this city officially opened on July 1st; I once drove to the home to visit. Later, I wanted to know more about the history and organization of the home, so yesterday afternoon, I made a special trip to the first home on Baoan Road in the South City for a visit.</p>
<p>The Baoan Nursing Home is an affiliated charitable organization of the Shanghai Charity Association. It was founded in the 19th year of the Republic of China, which is about six or seven years ago. It is said that the head of the Shanghai Charity Association is a Mr. Qi from Suzhou, who runs many charitable undertakings. Currently, in addition to this Baoan Nursing Home, the Shanghai Charity Association also includes Tongren Fuyuan Hall, Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall, Vagrant Work Training Center, Infant Nursery, Lishai Small Vegetable Market, Puyi Vocational Training Center, Women and Children Relief Institute, and no less than a dozen other places; in addition, there is also a poverty relief institute in Suzhou, which currently houses four or five hundred people.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce what I learned from my impressions to the public:</p>
<p>Admission Procedures The home, based on the fact that homeless elderly people often wander the streets, and because of their old age, they cannot support themselves and have nowhere to turn, which is a very miserable situation. Therefore, they aim to take in lonely elderly people over the age of sixty who are truly helpless—only men are accepted, not women. The first step in the admission process is to register at the home, and after approval, you must find a suitable guarantor. After the home sends staff to investigate and verify the facts, you can formally enter the home. However, those with family members and those under the age of sixty are refused admission. No fees are required upon admission, and all living necessities and clothing bedding are provided by the home.</p>
<p>Management Situation The management methods of the home are very complete: for example, the elderly people in the home are all assigned numbers, and other utensils, towels, clothes, and seats are also numbered, and everyone must not occupy each other, so as to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>There are one hundred and eighty wardrobes in the storage room, all with numbers on them, and each person can use one. There are also staff in the room to manage. In the bedroom, there are ten single iron beds arranged in each room. In winter, there is a mattress and a quilt, and now there is a mat and a thin quilt, also with numbers. Furthermore, among the ten people in each room, two capable people are appointed as the head and deputy head of the room. A sign is nailed to the door of the room, and the names of each person and the head and deputy head are written on it. All notices in the home must be conveyed by the head and deputy head, and if anything happens in the room, or if the elderly have any needs, the head and deputy head will contact the office. The dining tables in the dining hall are arranged very neatly, like desks in a classroom. Each table seats nine people, and the seats are also numbered. Each person must sit according to the number, and each number</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>has a small drawer in which each person's bowls and chopsticks are placed, and everyone has an enamel cup for drinking tea. In a corridor, there are also many individual bamboo chairs, one for each person, which they can move around at any time; they can freely sit wherever they like.</p>
<p>The elderly people in the home are absolutely not allowed to go out at ordinary times, and if they violate the rules of the home, they will be educated or slightly reprimanded, and those who continue to be wicked will be expelled, but this situation rarely happens.</p>
<p>Daily Life Their daily life is very mechanized. Three meals a day: porridge in the morning, rice at noon, and half porridge and half rice in the evening. They eat vegetarian food all year round. Usually, there is one dish per person, and there are four days of extra dishes per month, which are the 2nd, 8th, 16th, and 24th of each month. On these four days, each person has two bowls of side dishes per meal. They get a haircut every half month, and now they must take a bath once a day.</p>
<p>After eating, they can all freely find entertainment in the home, each according to their own preferences, or chant Buddhist scriptures, or read books and newspapers, or take a walk and chat, or sleep, or plant flowers and water vegetables, and planting flowers and watering vegetables can also get rewards from the home. If they are happy to make something useful, then the home will also provide them with the things they need; but they are absolutely prohibited from making noise and arguing.</p>
<p>About Expenses The home was originally established by the Shanghai Charity Association, so all expenses are allocated by the Shanghai Charity Association. Currently, the home consumes more than one stone of rice per day on average (slightly less in summer). Including other clothing, utensils, vegetables, oil, salt, and the salaries of staff and workers, it costs more than 10,000 yuan per year. The land and houses are all owned by the Shanghai Charity Association.</p>
<p>Treatment of Illness and Death The home is also responsible for the elderly people who fall ill. Those who are seriously ill are sent to the hospital, and those who are mildly ill are treated in the home's infirmary with doctors and nurses on duty day and night. If they die, if relatives are willing to come to collect the body, they are allowed to do so. If no one comes to collect the body, it will be taken care of by the home.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Home's Location The home has more than forty acres of land, with a total of seventy-two rooms. Although the houses are single-story, they are very spacious, and each room has two windows at the back. The architectural style is also new, with glass doors and windows. There are two large courtyards and two small courtyards in the front and back, all with corridors around them, and the air is very well ventilated. There is a flower bed in the center of the fire courtyard, planted with various flowers. In the front, there is also a small horticultural field, covering more than twenty acres, in the middle of which, in addition to a small river, there is also a crop room and a small flower room, where many melons, fruits, vegetables, and potted flowers are planted. These are left behind by them in loneliness, or spontaneously, and it is said that the home also rewards those who do these things. That is, they are willing to do it for a day, and there will be a reward for a day. However, these are all based on their own initiative, and the home does not force them.</p>
<p>The equipment in the housing section includes eighteen bedrooms, one storage room, one Buddhist hall, one infirmary, one medicine cooking room, one kitchen, one washing room, one study room, one dining hall, one office, one staff bedroom, one worker bedroom, one staff toilet, one worker toilet, one water heater, one room, one item storage room, and several elderly people's urinals. As for those places, there are three or four rooms combined into one room, and there are also one or two rooms combined into one room, and the light and air in each room are very sufficient, and the environment can be said to be extremely quiet.</p>
<p>The home has now taken in one hundred and eighty elderly people. Because it is full, it is impossible to take in more people for a while. However, there are still many referrals from various institutions and registrations. Therefore, a second home has been set up in Jiangyuan Lane. It was originally a poverty clinic, also run by the Shanghai Charity Association. There are more than ten rooms, and a wide building, and a large courtyard. The air, light, and environment are similar to the first home, but it lacks a piece of open space. The organization and methods are also based on the first home, but the limit is only forty people, so when it opened on July 1, the quota was already full, and it will only be possible to take in more people after the original quota is reduced.</p>
<p>In terms of employees, there are currently seven staff members and more than ten workers in the first home, and four staff members and six or seven workers in the second home.</p>
<p>In recent years, various provinces have promoted respect for the elderly and held respect for the elderly conferences: but what they respect are only some rich elderly people, and those poor elderly people in the vast stratum who are forgotten by people are not given attention.</p>
<p>Save these poor elderly people!</p>
<h3>Smuggling Comes Amidst Rampant Voices: Let's Talk About Women's Decorations</h3>
<p>— Wen Hai</p>
<p>China is a semi-colonial country and a battleground for the sale of surplus goods by various powers. Therefore, various powers can use their superior position in China to systematically extract and exploit the Chinese people in all aspects!</p>
<p>The smuggling problem in North China is now becoming increasingly serious. It is precisely the implementation of a consistent and vicious policy of planned aggression against China. The increasing expansion of the smuggling problem will not only affect the Chinese government's fiscal revenue, but also accelerate the destruction of Chinese industry and commerce. They want to make China's weak national industry forever in a state of decline and depression.</p>
<p>It is said that among the smuggled goods, in addition to piece goods, food, rayon, and children's toys, most of them are women's cosmetics, which account for an important position. How much of China's annual deficit is spent on women's perfumes, powders, rouge, hair gel, etc.? The customs report has already been published in various newspapers, so I will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>The love of beauty is human nature, especially women's fondness for beauty. They believe that decoration is produced under the condition of love of beauty, especially for women in prosperous cities. Everyone competes to be beautiful and unique, and the entire life time is almost entirely occupied by decoration. On the bodies of these beauty lovers, the waste of time and the loss of money for the women in the country are probably difficult to count.</p>
<p>A news item was published in the Shen Bao's June 17th local news column, which talked about the fashionable clothes of 1936, which detailed that Westerners wear summer cloth made in China. Summer cloth is woven from linen, which is durable, beautiful, and cheap. Westerners actually regard summer cloth as the most fashionable clothes this year. Looking back at the country, they pick up summer cloth and wear imported silk gauze, foreign money. It is not worth it.</p>
<p>If the smuggling problem is not resolved, it will lead our country to death. This is so dangerous! However, how can the smuggling problem be thoroughly resolved? It is useless for the government to promulgate anti-smuggling regulations and severely punish smugglers. To solve the problem at the root, I hope that the people of the country will cooperate to resist the smuggling incident.</p>
<p>The oppression of imperialism has reached the final stage. I hope that women across the country will quickly wake up and take on this arduous responsibility to save the Chinese nation from danger. Like the women of Abyssinia, go to the front line with their husbands! Arise! People who don't want to be slaves!</p>
<h3>Wheat</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Uncle Genshou stood at the foot of the ladder, his hands on his hips, looking up at the dimly lit attic and nagging: "Are you suffering from lazy jaundice? You look like you're going to die. Do you know that the grain market closes early in hot weather? Hurry up, hurry up, you lazy thing..."</p>
<p>A woman's head appeared in the dimly lit attic, tied with a calico headscarf. Her face was sad. She slowly fastened the basket with rope buckles. The basket was full of wheat. She was not sick, but the glossy shape of each grain of wheat, the bright earthy yellow color, and the aroma that stimulated appetite aroused endless sadness in her heart. From bearing the scorching sun, crouching in the sharp awns, letting the humid and hot ground vapor scorch her eyes until they were blurred, and grabbing the sickle to cut the field...until throwing out the grains, drying them again and again, moving them to the attic, throwing them into the wooden cabinet, it hasn't even been a month, but now they have to be sold.</p>
<p>"Is this basket enough?" she said, while slowly lowering the basket of wheat. Her attachment to the money also dropped to the ground. Aunt Genshou was not a very stingy woman, but she was really reluctant to sell the wheat.</p>
<p>"One basket, two baskets, it's not like I'm selling them to eat, gamble, or whore. Whose field did you plant? Don't you have to pay rent? How much soybean cake did you put down? Don't you have to pay back the money? Don't you have to pay the high interest on the ten coppers from Dalong? You sit at home, what do you know? The wheat market is good these days. If you don't take advantage of the situation to sell some and pay people back, can you delay it? Do you think I want to owe people with a straight face...?" Uncle Genshou lowered his head, untied the rope buckle at the edge of the basket, and kept nagging as he measured it with a斗(dǒu). When he used his palm to scrape the wheat on the surface of the 斗(dǒu), he felt a smooth touch and couldn't help but feel sad in his heart. This sadness was hidden in his nagging words.</p>
<p>Genshou always said in front of people—even if he met a stranger passing by at the crossroads:</p>
<p>"Alas, who doesn't think I'm a hardworking and ingratiating person? I don't waste a penny all year round. I don't touch a pipe, I don't drink liquor, I don't step into a teahouse, let alone gamble. But I don't know where the harvests go after one harvest after another. As soon as they come from the field, they have to be sold. Later, I have to borrow a升(shēng) here and a 斗(dǒu) there. I myself don't believe it. Year after year, who am I busy for?"</p>
<p>Sometimes, he even sighed like this to his own woman.</p>
<p>When Aunt Genshou lowered the second basket of wheat to the ground, he slipped out a series of repetitive nagging: "You sit at home, what do you know? The wheat market is good these days. If you don't take advantage of the situation to sell some..." complaining about his woman's words. Aunt Genshou couldn't help but wipe the sweat beads that were flowing to the edge of her eyelids in the attic and said, "The market is good, the wheat market is good, but why doesn't the Guilin grandpa's family, who owes hundreds of 担(dàn) of wheat, sell it even when the market owner comes to the door? Doesn't he know the market is good?" It seemed that she held a powerful citation to refute him.</p>
<p>However, this citation became a kind of stimulation in Uncle Genshou's ears, and the reaction to the stimulation was another round of nagging: "You said Guilin grandpa's family owes hundreds of 担(dàn) of wheat, do you know why he doesn't sell it? You won't know even if you die. He doesn't need money, only people owe him, not him owing people. He hoards it at home to prepare to kill the poor in the future. His brother-in-law runs a flour mill, and he is very well-informed about the market. What is he worried about! He will wait until everyone is holding their stomachs before opening the warehouse to bargain. Can we compare with him? You are daydreaming, you are having a fever..."</p>
<p>Aunt Genshou hoisted the empty basket up to the attic, and her sad face disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>Opening "Lament of the Fifth Watch"</p>
<p>The Jingde Banquet Tower strikes the first drum. The imperial concubine sits alone, tears streaming down her face. Only because her husband is away with no news. His whereabouts are uncertain. Could it be that he has fallen in love with another woman in another country, more talented than I am? Therefore, the news is silent and difficult to grasp. Making me sit and listen to the second drum, my breath is difficult to extinguish. My love, I think of the flowery words you said before you left. Saying that once you arrive in the capital, you will wave your brush. Good news will convey beauty. But alas, I am waiting for letters but none arrive. It is like a kite with a broken string, its voice and breath gone. The third watch passes. The fourth watch passes. I am alone and desolate. My tormentor, alas, my heart is tied in knots, my hatred is difficult to extinguish. The imperial concubine sighs and seldom consults. That miserable situation is even more difficult to describe. Alas... My lord. If you cannot let go of a loving, righteous, and beautiful sheep. You can also bring her back to share the nest. Two horses can be in the same trough. I will never be jealous. Sisters will call each other happily. I only hate that my lord's heart is not as kind as mine. Leaving good intentions to hide in a crowd of people. What is bitter is that the long night and short dream are difficult to pass. I only hear the sound of the fifth drum faintly knocking from the city tower. One sound low. One sound high. One sound far. One sound floating. Sound echoes and laments. Passing so desolately. The imperial concubine feels even more bored. Suddenly, I hear the sound of insects chirping like weeping on all sides. Lamenting the fifth watch ruined the beauty. Even your heart of iron will be moved.</p>

<p>Opening "Lament for the Lotus"</p>
<p>The scorching sun shines on the lotus pond. The lotus stands tall like the sixth son. Everyone envies the gown. Dragonflies busy in the air. Deep love binds the mandarin ducks. The arm pledge is deep and the days are long. I remember the handsome demeanor of the He Lang. I remember the captivating beauty of the water town. People talk about the beauty of immortals. Twin flowers bloom, the world is fragrant. I only hate that temporary joy is difficult to last. In an instant, the autumn wind has become very cold. The light silk sleeves are too thin. Even the snobbish mandarin ducks do not live in harmony. I remember the day when the emerald sleeves galloped in the wind. Did you write your name to report to Wang Chang? Now, summer is over and autumn has come, it is difficult to be satisfied. Even those withered branches and leaves are not fragrant. The worldly state of warmth and coldness is truly hateful. Recalling the past is like a dream. I advise the world not to say that the hot weather is easy to pass. When the autumn coolness comes, the sour and spicy taste will be personally tasted. I lament the lotus and satirize the world. It is not to offend the Sixth Son. Song Yu is sad for autumn, self-inflicted.</p>

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>Elastic Girl Published Today</h3>
<p>The Yingwu News Agency publishes the "Elastic Girl" weekly, which is a publication specializing in news about dance halls and dancers. The content is rich and interesting. The inaugural issue has been published today and sells for 5 French currency per copy. It is sold at all newspaper stalls. The contents of the inaugural issue include anecdotes about Liang sisters, Chen Jingfang, Sun Lifang, Zhao Lianfang, Zhao Manli, Niu Lulu, Little Sister Li, Little Sister Chen, Wang Mary... and other popular dance stars.</p>
<h3>New Nine O'Clock Dance Troupe</h3>
<p>Performing at the Carlton Theatre</p>
<p>Two years ago, there was a famous American dance troupe called the "Nine O'Clock Dance Troupe" that performed in Shanghai. At that time, it was praised by the people of Shanghai and its business was excellent. Today, the "New Nine O'Clock Dance Troupe" performing at the Carlton is based on the "Nine O'Clock Dance Troupe", plus a lot of talented people and new tricks, which is a hundred times more exciting than the previous performance. The content includes enchanting exotic dances, soul-stirring love songs, intoxicating music, and hilarious comedies. Everything is a modern aesthetic. It is said that it is as tempting as the most famous midnight dance troupe in Paris. The theater does not increase seat prices in order to popularize it.</p>
<h3>Marriage Statistics of Hollywood Actors</h3>
<p>— Mars</p>
<p>Average of only six years of history per couple</p>

<p>Last year, thirty female stars went through divorces, and this year they got married again! (According to American law, couples who have divorced must wait a period of time before they can marry again.)</p>

Such as Mr. and Mrs. George Ali for thirty-five years, Mr. and Mrs. Harashoto for twenty-two years, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Condon for twenty-one years, Mr. and Mrs. Warner Baxter for twenty years, Mr. and Mrs. Paul Muni for fourteen years, Mr. and Mrs. Locke for twelve years, Lyon Barrymore for twelve years, and Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Gleason for twenty-eight years.</p>
