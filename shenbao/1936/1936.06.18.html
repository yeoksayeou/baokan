<h3>速定救亡大計</h3>
<p>自從湘南的粵桂軍撤退以後時局轉趨和緩祇要雙方相見以誠雖外交上主張輕重緩急容有出入但在同一救國的目標上終可獲得共同解决的途徑然後得以一致的步驟全力應付空前的外患國人在近數週來注目於國內時局的紛擾而外力的壓迫却已與日俱增試看今日華北的情形那一件不是怵目驚心的事實啊</p>
<p>我們從這次時局的紛擾可以得到一個最寳貴的敎訓就是國內意見愈分岐愈益增加外力壓迫的機會反過來說國家應付外患有切實的辦法不僅全國的意見和力量可以集中就是外力的壓迫也可自然减少現在中央和兩廣意見的出入就在救國的辦法問題而全國國民所希望於中央的也就是從速議定切實的救亡大計從應付外患上來團結全國的意志和力量我國外交上過去的錯誤就是着着受人支配完全陷於被動的地位頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚人家却處心積慮以謀我有組織有步驟處處拿一手造成的旣定事實來做要挾講條件的工具我國因為遷就事實在外交上遂形成反主為賓的局面必待救亡大計决定以後始可以談到積極的自主外交而張外長所謂「在本國求自存在國際求共存」的話才有實現的可能</p>
<p>異族的侵略已一步逼緊一步了現在中央决定七月十日召開二中全會集合全國的賢豪共商救亡之大計我們不僅希望兩廣當局能親自來京出席陳述意見更希望此會有一切合乎實際的議决案明示全國須知在此一髮千鈞的時候絕對不許我們再有因循敷衍的時問呢</p>

<h3>英內閣議決　撤銷對意制裁</h3>
<p>衆議院今日辯論外交　首相外相將宣布立塲</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣頃於本日午後舉行閣議、當决定對意制裁辦法宜予以撤消、（十七日哈瓦期社急電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）衆信今日內閣舉行每週集會時、將正式决定主張取銷對意制裁、惟須日內瓦衆意咸同、英國始能出此、閣員今已在原則上贊同此政策、所未悉者、自治領之態度耳、尤其因南菲聯邦首相赫査格將軍昨夜復切實聲明南菲决繼續擁護制裁政策之故、</p>
<p>同時觀察家現正注視取銷制裁之倡議、於意國外交政策將有何種影饗、據羅馬來電稱、取銷制裁今雖可保其必成事實、但政界非俟國聯各會員國正式宣布取銷後、不願討論意國在歐合作問題、故明日英下院縱宣布英國將在日內瓦提議取銷對意制裁、意國亦不致參加六月二十二日在孟特勒舉行考慮士耳其申請准其復在韃靼納爾海峽建設防禦工程事之會議、蓋料制裁不能在六月二十二日前取銷也、至意國對於制裁之取銷是否滿意、或尙將謀將日內瓦認意國為侵略者之判决、一併撤廢、現尙未悉、惟意國觀察家對於意政府終必允在歐洲政治中與各國充分合作一節、現不抱有疑慮、（十七日路透社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）各報近多載稱、意大利對於撤銷制裁辦法之議、幷不以為滿足、擬再進一步而要求國聯大會前於去年十月間判决意大利為侵略國之宣言、務須加以撤消、夫然後意國對於國際事件始可與各國重行合作云云、此間意國方面人士頃謂、此項消息並不確鑿、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>通俗講座貞德救國記Joan　of　　Are　（1412－1431）  費仁　　——拯救法國的女英雄　　中國歷史上，曾經有過一位木蘭女士代父從軍，　人人所羡慕，却不知外國歷史上，也曾有過一位貞德女士投軍救國，把一個快滅亡了的法國從英帝國主義者們的手中救回來，使它恢復舊日的光榮，至今成了世界上第一等强國。這位女士的動榮偉業是何等的值得我們仰望啊！　　說起來，選姑娘是一四一二牛出生的。她的爸和媽都是法國多烈米域的農民，大家本本分分的過日子，原不是做官帶爵的高貴人家。貞德從小就赤腳草鞋跟父母哥哥下田。她身子結實，長得又高又大，有一股了不起的蠻力，打架時差不多瘦小　的男人都打不過她。　　多烈米城鄰近着伯根底國，時常有伯根底人越界跳來砍他們的樹木，收糧食，搶馬搶牛的鬧得農民不得安生。伯根底人跟英國勾結一起，英國打法國東邊，伯根底就打西邊。法國打了好幾次敗仗，抵不過英國人，自然也打不了伯根底人。多烈米的農民受苦不堪，便大家自己組織起來日夜練槍習武共同防守村落。伯根底人一来就鳴鑼聚衆，全體農民齊集，把伯根底人往往殺得大敗而逃。這打仗的農民裏，年最小，打得最勇敢的便是貞德。她不過是個十四五歲的女孩子，但因爲她打起來總是極勇敢，手段又高，所以不久她就成了一羣小孩子們的領袖。　　這時英國却越打越利害了。牠仗着牠的衝車堡壘，攻城搶地，勢如破竹，把法國的都城巴黎佔傾了又進兵西上包圍了俄　城，預備乘此席捲法國西都，實行牠的大陸政策，滅掉法國好作全欧洲的皇帝，因爲那時的欧洲只有法國才是一個大國呢。　　法國國王早已在戰事中死掉了。太子攝位被英國人追得東逃西避，無地安身。這時俄甯城若被攻破，英兵長驅直下，這位太子就活不成，法國也就要亡了。英國人明白這一點，所以圍打饿甯城特別利害。他們在俄甯城外築起堡壘碉樓　圍困這城池，日夜攻打不休。城中人因爲被圍太久，　　死傷，苦不堪言，可是大家拼命的支持着，日夜盼望援兵到來，好把英人趕走，重見天日。　　援兵不是沒有。由各處來的已經到了好幾萬，可是大家見了英人的堡壘碉樓，誰都不敢是第一個沖上去，怕損失了自己的兵力。這些人都是軍閥，他們以爲只是自己有兵，便是國家亡了，還可以投到英國去，英國皇帝也是用得着將軍元帥的，苦的只是城裏城外的人民罷了，但他們以爲人民死傷幾千算不了一回事。　　將軍大臣們　　派人去藓格蘭求救兵，自己這邊先不要抵抗，看蘇格蘭皇帝的意思怎樣再定。這樣將軍們都按兵不動，俄甯城的形勢愈来愈急。全法國人民的心如同掉在湯鍋裏一樣的焦急痛苦，全國人民都氣憤不堪，要自動起來合英人决一死戰。這時候女英雄貞德心裏尤其憤恨着急，她天天招集自己的一隊小國民加緊操練，爲國家的事痛哭流涕。她們極端反對不抵抗，也極其反對依賴蘇格蘭人。她們覺得要救國家只有法國人民自己起来和敵人拚命。　　一天，貞德領着她的一羣少年人偷跑了。跑到了太子那裏，大家伏地痛哭，要求太子派他們上前綫去。太子見他們都年小，貞德還才十七歲，不要她們去。貞德急了，心生一計。她知道那時人都迷信上帝，迷信神力，她便說：　　「太子，我奉上帝的旨意來救法國，上帝親口對我說的，他要帮助我們驅逐英人，立你爲法國皇帝，你是上帝所挑選的。你若不派我去，上帝發怒，你的帝位眞難保了啊」。　　她用許多方法到底打動了太子的心，便遣人領她們去俄甯城。她們一到，四處援兵見小孩子都勇烈來參戰救國，幾萬人都感激歡呼起來。貞德把大義曉諭他們，鼓勵將士去進攻敵人，拯救國家，她哭着說：「法國是我們人民自己的，我們不救她誰肯來救啊？弟兄們，快來，讓我們大家拚死吧！」說完她就舞起寶劍向城下衝來，所有幾萬士兵一起歡噪的跟她衝上去，將軍們無法禁止。立時城裏也聽見了外面的聲音知道援兵到了，都勇氣百倍城牆上便擂起戰鼓，吹起戰號，由城門裏也衝出了一隊破爛襤褸，骨瘦如柴精神如獅子的士兵來，舆外面裏應外合，夾攻敵人，英人猝不及備，竟被他們這些英勇的救國兒童殺得大敗而逃，堡壘也放棄了，躱到橋邊的碉樓上去了。　　這一塲勝仗的結果眞是非同小可。起先法國將军大家要保存實力，不肯抵抗，被英人排山倒海而來，奪去了法國大半壁江山。法國人一個個垂頭喪氣，以爲法國到底打不過英人，法國總是會亡在英人手裏的。誰知道一次，貞德振臂一呼，全國人都應聲而起，抗起了救國的大旗，到處舆英人拚命。他們這才明白這個國家是自的，要救她全得靠人民自已，每一村每一縣凡有英人統治的地方，法國人都跳起来拿着斧頭鐮刀，鍋饒戈矛向他們砍去。英國壓下了這兒，那兒又爆發起來，那兒剛鎭平，這兒又鬧了。死了許多人，赔了許多錢，却制不住一寸法國地方。最後，英國皇帝無法，只得下令撤兵，放棄了征服法國的企圖。從那以後，法國人深深覺悟要救國家，單靠人民自己。他們自此勵精圖強，變成一個偉大的國家。　　貞穗因爲首創起義，英國人和將軍大臣們都恨她。牠們把她抓住，　個罪名將她綁在大柱上要活活燒死她。可是貞德一點不傷心，也不害怕，臨死時，她仰天大叫道：「好了，人民已經起來，法國永遠不會滅亡了！！」李廣  雲波　　李廣是漢時隴西人，他出自將鬥，世世學射，所以他少時騎馬射箭的本領，已是高人一等。那時北方有個很蠻橫的民族叫匈奴，時常侵略邊地，和漠兵開戰。漢文帝時，李廣隨大軍征匈奴，因爲善於騎射，射殺了許多匈奴兵的領袖，便升做武騎常侍。有一天，李廣隨駕出遊，半路遇着猛獸，他就用手格殺了牠。漢文帝見了他的本領，讃道：「可惜你生得太遲了，若生再高皇帝楚漢紛爭的時候，封萬戶侯還消說嗎？」　　李廣非但騎射本事高強，並且很有膽識。當他做上郡太守的時候，匈奴又起兵侵犯上郡。有一天，李廣帶了百餘個骑兵，親自追趕三個匈奴兵。當李廣射死二人，活捉一人，想骑上馬回營的時候；忽見前面離開不遠的地方，有幾千個匈奴兵。那些匈奴兵見了李廣這邊只有一百多騎兵，以爲背後還有大隊人馬隨着，便很驚慌地逃上山去，列成隊伍，準備抵禦。李廣身旁的百餘骑兵，也都很害怕，想回身逃命。李廣却並不怕。他說：「我們離開大軍幾十里路，前面敵兵却離開得很近，要跑是跑不掉的。我們假使不逃，匈奴便以爲我們有大軍伏在旁邊接濟，便不敢下山来攻擊我們了。」　　李廣非但不退後，並且還命令手下的骑兵一齊向前。到離開匈奴列陣的地方，大約二里遠便停止。又發命令道：「大家都下馬，解去馬鞍，在此休息。」　　有些膽小的騎兵問他道：「敵兵很多，又很近，假使他們衝下山來攻擊我們，怎樣辦呢？」　　李廣笑道：「你們看匈奴兵的態度，不是很怕我們有伏兵，不敢下來接戰嗎？我們假使要逃走，他们　我們膽怯，便知道我們的虛實，便要下來追趕了。現在我們街區馬鞍休息，表示決不逃走，敵人看見我們這樣膽大，便以爲我們一定有伏兵，决不敢來攻擊我們了。」　　果然，匈奴兵見漢兵這樣膽大，以爲一定有大軍伏在旁邊，只管準備抵禦，並不攻下山攻擊他們。　　隔了一回，匈奴有一個骑白馬的將軍，率了一小隊騎兵，排在山前　隊，那是防漢兵襲擊，或預備襲擊漢兵用的。李廣很知道匈奴兵護隊的意思，便領着十多個起兵衝上前去，突然放一箭把匈奴的將軍射死，仍舊　囘馬退到原處，將馬鞍解去，故意顯出安閑的樣子。還命令他的兵士，将馬鞍肚带等放鬆了，讓馬去吃草，兵士們便臥在地上休息。這時天色漸漸黑暗，匈奴兵終害怕着不敢進攻。還以爲旁邊伏着的漢兵，要在　裏襲擊他們，慌忙在半夜裏逃回去了。天明明　李廣便很平安的率領者隊伍回營。　　後來李廣奉命出雁門關擊匈奴，因爲匈奴兵比漢兵多好幾倍，所以把漠兵打敗，李廣也被匈奴兵活捉去了。甸奴王素聞李廣处個英雄，使下令把李廣解上去。那時李廣正患着病，匈奴兵把李廣放在兩隻馬中簡的繩床上躺着，載走了去。李廣起先装做沒有氣力，像將死的樣子。走了十幾里路後，偷眼看着旁邊恰巧有一個匈奴兵，騎着一匹好馬，押着他走。李廣便奮力一跳，跳上那匹馬，把匈奴兵推下馬去，順手搶了一把弓，帶轉馬頭，便向南跑回来。跑了幾十里，凑巧和敗殘的漢兵相遇，便一同逃走。這時匈奴追捕他的兵，約有幾百人，看看趕近了，李廣不慌不忙，取弓搭箭，接連射殺幾人，把其餘的追兵也都嚇跑了。自此以後，匈奴兵都　李廣　「飛將軍」，有好幾年不敢侵犯李廣所守的地方。　　有一次，李廣帶領四千騎兵，和匈奴作戰。匈奴用四萬兵圍困他。李廣的士卒都很驚恐。李廣便差他的兒子敢，率領數十騎，前去衝陣。向中央一直衝進去，衝出了陣，從兩旁繞回來，一些沒有受傷。兵士方才略爲安心，　得匈奴兵雖多，可是都不利害的。李廣叫他的兵，排成一個圓陣，向着敵兵。這時匈奴兵圍得很緊急，箭像雨般射來，漢兵死得很多。漢兵的箭却漸漸要用完了。李廣便叫士兵只将弓拉開，不要亂放。自己拿一把可以連發幾箭的大弓，對着敵方將官們射，疊連射殺了幾個將官。因此匈奴們才不敢緊逼，稍爲後退一些。天色漸漸黑暗，漢兵都駭得面無人色，但是李廣仍舊神色不變，很興奮地指揮着。後來幸而救兵到了，方才脫險。從此以後，李廣的勇敢和膽量，愈加出名了。　　李廣很喜歡打獵，有一次薄暮時分，他看見一叢草堆裏伏着一個老虎。便一箭射去，只見它伏着動也不動，他走近一看，原來是一塊石頭，那箭頭竟都嵌在石頭裏面去了。後來再射幾次，那箭頭却再也射不進去了。可見他的箭術，真是出神入化。他聽自己管轄的　城內有虎患時，終喜歡自己去射虎。有一次被虎撲傷得很厲害，却仍舊帶傷將老虎殺死　　李廣生平沉默寡言，不曾花言巧語。對於士卒，却很愛護。他用了很眞誠的熊度對待士卒，所以士卒也都愛護他，願意替他出力，拚命殺敵。他不時和士卒一同吃喝，在行軍很口渴，遇到水的時候，要待士卒都喝了水，他才喝水。在　　的時候，要待士卒都吃飽了，他才吃。他受到賞賜，總要分給他的士卒。他得到俸禄，總要拿来周濟窮人。所以家裏並沒一些儲蓄，並且始終不談論家產的事情。他出入西域，和匈奴轉戰了數十年，手下的小將都封了侯、他却始終不會做大官。後來他恃才負氣，在軍中自刎而死。死的時候，　下的將官士卒，都哭得很悲傷。全國的民眾，也都流着淚嘆息。李廣實在是值得我們紀念和敬仰的偉人。　　唐朝王昌齡有首詩道：「秦時明月漢時關，萬里長征人未還，但使龍城飛將在，不教胡馬渡陰山。」那飛將就是指李廣，並且嘆息守邊的將軍，　李廣般的很少啊！出版界出版界與批評  珧華　　有了人類，便有了批評；因爲凡是人類都有思考的能力，有了思考的能力，便能判斷是非，辨别黑白；是非黑白判別後表明出來，便是批評了。批評在英文中是Criticism，源於希臘文的Krinein，牠的意義，也是分別與判斷。　　批評既是如此的與人性相終始，那末在出版界上，自然佔有了重要的地位，尤其是文藝界上，文藝批評幾乎是成了一種專科的學術。但是很不幸地，　你是成了一種學術，而文藝批評（以及其他批評），却往往出了亂子，因此引起了許多無謂的諭爭，這究竟應該歸咎於那一方面呢？　　要舉理由，則「公說公有理，婆說婆理」，大家都有相當的理由。作者的　抗批評家，理由是批評者的學識應當比作者更爲廣博，並目勤　時能寫出更好的作品来；但是事實上並不如此。批評者的批評作品，大都和「看客　　　　　喝倒　，食客在膳堂裏發標」一樣，假如「看客開口」唱戲，食客動手一做菜，那就難說了」。（魯迅語）因此魯迅的意思是最好批評者不要兼做創作，否則不免寫出下面這種東西來：　　「宇宙之廣大呀，我說不出；　　父母之恩呀，我說不出；　　爱人之爱呀，我說不出。　　阿呀阿呀，我說不出」！　　這也未免太挖苦批評者了，但是若要批評家的知識和才力，一定比創作者更勝一籌，那未恐怕有批評資格的人太少了。而一般的意見，以概抹殺，也非正理。　　作者的反抗批評家的第二個理由是因爲批評家的見解，不一定是公允。求疵的和捧場的批評，固然是抹殺事實，徒逞私見，就是尋常的批評，也往往因爲立塲或背景的不同，而有各別的見地。超越一切偏執見解的批評是批評的理　，但是很不容易做到，因此時常引起作家對於批評者的反感。　　至於在批評家方面，自有他一方面的見解，當然也是基於某種合理的原則之下的。但是批評家與創作者，往往因爲文人相輕的綠故，爲了一點小事。引起了很大的爭執，這當然大家都失掉了他們應有的態度了。因此我很佩服周作人先生在「自己的園地」的自序中所取的熊度：　　「我這五十三篇小文，我要申明一句，並不是什麼批評。我相信批評是主觀的欣賞，不是客觀的檢察；是抒情的論文，不是盛氣的指摘；然而我對於前者實在没有這樣自信，對於後者也還要有一點自尊，所以在眞假批評兩方面都不能比附上去。」　　假如大家都能採取這樣的態度，一切無謂的論爭，豈不都可免掉？本來創作者須要批評者的正直的批評，以改進他的作品；而批評者也須要接受创作者的辯訴，明瞭創作者在寫作時所感受到的情况，而對於批評正的確性，有更深刻的辨別；這樣的和衷共濟，才能兩方面都受到利益，而不　有什麽壞的影響。　　現在要講一些批評者批評一篇作品時應有的步驟：第一他得把他所接到的作品，視作是能生出一種特殊快感的印象，他接受了這種印象，再將牠細心的解析，然後用自己的肇　表明出來，批評便完成了。假如祇感受而不解析，便祇有一個模糊的印象；　解析而不感受，便祇有零　的批評；都不是　正　當的批評。　　批評者在表明他的批評時，應當服從下列幾條　條：　　　不可人云亦云，要　自己細心考查後再决定判語：　　　注　　　批評動機，不要爲了一時感情的　動而隨意批評；　　　　批抨必須是良知的　現，不可混淆黑白，顛倒是非　　　超越一切　執的見解，保持嚴正的態度。　　在我國正需要文化建設的今日，我們當然需要出版界的努力，但是爲防止投機的出版物在市塲上擾亂讀者的目光起見，我們又需要嚴正的批評來燃　　　，這　是我寫這篇小文的動機。介紹「蘇聯新女性」  張星海　　蘇聯，這一個新興的社會主義共和國，自從崛起於這世界上以後，有的人把它當作神一般的頌讃着，有的人狂怒地把它詛咒着，然而不論頌讃也好，詛咒也好，總之，能細心地去認識考察研究它的，渺不可得。於是蘇聯變成了謎一樣的東西，給人們盲目地頌讃着和詛咒着。　　到了近年來，世界各國研究蘇聯的工作，比較地推進了。我國也有少數學者實地去考察，並且還有幾種雜誌，作專門性的研究。不過作者的意見，認爲過去的考察研究的方法，還感到不夠。因為一種新社會制度的建立，自有它歷史的因緣，要研究它瞭解它，非要從歷史上下一番功夫不可。此其一；察考一種新社會制度的內容，不能祗看表面，應該深入裏層，此其二；考察新社會制度，不能祗看都市，該應顧及農村；不能祗看一部，應該看到全部；此其三；考察新社會制度，非但要注意該國政府的一切主義政策，政府負責人員的言行，而且更應顧及一般人民的思想行動及其觀感，此其四。作者認爲無論對於蘇聯作任何一方面的研究，這四點不作研究的主要條件，總是不夠的，不確實的。那麼國內一二學者跑到蘇聯去逛了一年半載，回來所寫成的視察報告或印象記，總有掛一漏萬的毛病，而且不無誇張過譽過毀之處，掩蔽了事態上一切的眞相。總然高呼研究蘇聯，實際上不還是一個謎嗎　　蘇聯的婦女問題，更是一個傳說中最光怪陸離的一個，不論婦女的性德問題，職業的問題，娼妓問題，兒童的問題，都有各種各樣的描述，在現在二十世紀的科學世界，交通是如是便利，文化是如此普及，還有這種怪現象產生，我們眞不無嗔飯之感！　　豪麗女士著的問甯德先生譯的「蘇聯新女性」，筆者覺得該書作者的態度，還相當嚴肅。豪麗女士對於俄國的歷史和文學，都有深刻的研究，而對於蘇聯的婦女問題，曾用了兩年半的光陰去作種種細密的考察，這一種研究的態度，是相當接近於我們的理想的。而且中間搜集的許多材料，旣有趣，又眞實，很足以爲我們研究婦女問題時的參考品。　　該書原文用文學的筆調寫出，譯筆又很流利清順，雖然有二十四萬字左右，但可使讀者一點也不感覺冗長之苦，謹介紹於我國一般讀者大衆。定價一元二角，世界書局出版。曾國藩之生平及事業  實　　蔣星德編　商務出版　　本書分上下兩編，計十二章五十四節，另有附錄三件，都十萬餘言，以現代之目光，對曾國藩之生平事業，作系統之研究。　　上編爲動態的部份，對曾氏的歷史，作詳細的叙述。第一程「少年時代」，列述曾氏所處的時代背景，曾國藩的家世，少年時代的生活，到北平去的經過。第二章「京官生活」，叙述曾氏的刻苦自勵，留心時務，觀察人才，鯁直敢言。第三章「督辦湘勇」，列述曾氏之丁憂回籍，創辦團練，創立湘軍。第四章「繼續不斷的奮鬥」，列舉其堅持作戰的經過。第五章「對於太平天國」，叙述其歷盡艱苦，克服南京。第六章「晚年生活」叙述其晚年政績，及逝世經過。　　下編爲靜態的部份，對曾國藩醫生的造詣，有清晰的評判。第七章「曾國藩的偉大人格」，列舉其律己以嚴，勤儉·拙誠·忠恕·謙讓等美德。第八章「曾國藩的政治思想」，闡明其思想的來源，和太平天國政治思想的衝突。第九章「曾國藩的行政方法」，列舉其作育人才，整飭吏治，清理財政，講立法度，振興教育，救濟民生，厲行建設等政策。第十章「曾國藩的治兵方略」，包括馭將·治兵·戰術·軍制·團練·聯絡士紳·實幹精神等。第十一章叙述其文學修養，列舉其在文學上的造詣，及其幽默的本性。最後一章，分晰曾氏對於當時及後世的影響，列舉其中興事業，一代風氣，及其對於後世的顯著影響。　　本書固爲一本歷史的著作，但亦為研究現實政治者所必讀，尤爲一般青年修養之最好讀物。穆勒經濟學原理  李先荷　　John　Stuart　Mill　原著　郭大力譯　世界出版　　我們不能不承認，穆勒在經濟學方面的成就，是非常偉大的。他雖然沒有獨創的思想系統，然而他的貢獻，決不在亞當。斯密·馬爾薩斯·里嘉圖之下。他在自傳裏說：「我自幼以來，自己覺得在思想界方面最宜擔任的工作，是建築橋樑，開拓道路，使已有的眞理，聯合成爲一個系統。」沒有別的說明更適宜於他自己批評自己的話了。　　筆者想在介紹穆勒的經濟學原理這一本書以前，先把穆勒思想上所受的影響，以及他刻苦研究的情況，簡單的介紹給各位讀者。　　穆勒在經濟學上所以有如此偉大的成就，的確是有家學淵源。他的父親在經濟學方面的深刻的研究，和循循善誘，對於穆勒自幼就受到了很好的陶冶。他的父親每天在散步時，把經濟學的原理·問題等，用演講的方式，傳授給他。翌日，穆勒必須把他父親昨天演述的筆記，繳給他校閱，訂正。就在他父親勤奮嚴謹的教養下，打成了穆勒經濟學上堅厚的基礎。　　除了他父親的傳授以外，還有他父親的親密的知己朋友，就是有名的經濟學家里嘉圖，他有着柔和的顏色，親切的態度，對於青年富有吸引的力量，穆勒就是給他深　薫陶的一位。里嘉圖是常到穆勒的家裏去的，穆勒研究了經濟學以後，也常到里嘉圖家裏去求教，在這種環境之下，穆勒的得益，當然不待說了。　　還有一位就是邊沁，邊沁雖然不是經濟學家，但對於穆勒的影響却是很深的。他在自傳中說：「我以前的教育，從某種意義說，已經在邊沁主義的道路中。……當我讀完立法論終卷時，我這個人就完全不同了。邊沁所思考而在他三卷巨著中所適用的「功利原則」，成功了我一個拱心石。把我知識上信仰上零碎混亂的現象，經起了一番整理，而結合在一起了。我對於事物的槪念，由此取得了統一。我現今有一個信條，一個主義，一個哲學了。」功利主義，是他的思想基礎之一，就是在他漸漸背離了邊沁主義以後，功利主義在他思想中還是佔到一個重要的地位。足證他受到邊沁思想影響之深刻了　　在這三位大思想家陶冶之下，再加上穆勒的天才，穆勒自己的發奮用功，他的成就，自然是非常偉大了。　　他在一八二五年的時候，祗不過是一位十九歲的青年，就寫了一篇震動一時的關於商業政策通貨政策的論文，發表在一個著名的雜誌上。同時他還集合了十餘位志同道合的同志，組織了一個研究會，把他父親的經濟學綱要一書，以爲共同研究討論的第一本書，在每一個星期，必須舉行研究會二次，從早晨八時到十時，在這兩小時中，他們在分章分節的讀着，按章按節的質疑析難着，必須要到他們每一個人都覺得充份理解，絕無疑竇以後，才肯放手，這種讀書的態度，當然使穆勒的造就，更築成了深厚的基礎了　　在穆勒一生的著作中，這經濟學原理是譯本最重要的著作，他自己說：「這本書不單純是一本抽象的科學書，且是一本應用書，不把經濟學當作孤立的學問，却把牠當作大全體中的一部份，即當作社會哲學的一部門。這一部門和其他各部門旣有密切的關係，所以其結論，即在其獨有領域內，亦祗附有條件是眞的，須受別範圍內的原因的干涉與抵消。」他並不把經濟學作一種孤立的學問，而認爲社會是有整個的聯繫性的，這一點，也是他經濟思想上的最重要的卓見。　　穆勒的經濟思想，承前啟後，在經濟思想史上的貢獻與價值，是不待說的，筆者謹介紹這位大思想家得巨著——經濟學原理於讀者之前，希望有志研究經濟學的人們，細加研讀，一定可以得到不少基本的理解。該書有六十萬言，全一册，定價四元，世界出版。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言母職講習會  方九　　華龍路上海婦女教育館現方訓練已爲母親者或將爲母親者之母職，使明暸母職之重要，及兒童教育教育之方法，藉以增進兒童幸福，並鞏固「民族基礎」起見，特定於七月六日起，至八月十五日止，舉辦母職講習會六星期，每天講習二小時。講習的科目，有　母親的責任，　兒童生理衛生，　家庭敎育，　生產須知，　兒童性敎育　模範母親，　嬰兒保育法，　兒童心理，　唱歌等。　　無疑的，這是値得我們嘉許婦女敎育館的，並且是使我們聽了那消息也是高興的。可不是嗎？我們以報章上和自己親眼目睹着的現象，如：不懂兒童心理學者，往往以兒童的一切行言要以爲父母者爲準則才對，因而有虐打兒童者；報紙上也時常見到，有貧苦的父母把自己的子女出賣或者殺死者；因沒有生產須知的方法而白送自己的生命者；有旣產了子女而不知保育法而致夭折者；不明白兒童的生理衛生，不懇切的指導子女對於性敎育的認識，而使子女對於自己生理的變化發生驚奇的；更重要的，呌子女不賭博而自己却大賭其博，而發生這種矛盾的家庭敎育者；更加重大者，爲母者不知自己責任的重大，而使子女敎導到升官發財或是其他不正確的道路上去者，………凡此種種，都是對於我們的「民族基礎」的鞏固有着莫大的妨礙，而上海婦女教育館能開辦這麼一個「母職講習會」，而所選科目又是百分之百的有着牠們的現實性，却是值得我們嘉許而又是値得我們高興的。　　可是以上所舉一切可說是不良的現象，都不是爲母者的不稱職，而是有着牠們的社會的根源的，這是一；由此敢斷定，所謂「母職講習會」也者，也只不過是一個治標的方法。第二，目下大貧者居多，「母職講習會」應該儘量的向一般勞苦婦女中去，務使那輩貧苦的婦女也可得到一點常識，雖然那「常識」的應用或許還成問題，然而有一點常識總是聊勝於無呀—第三，爲着要廣大的推行那工作，收學費可儘量的减低；或甚至於無。第四，「母職」在目下民族危機深化，却是非常重要，忽略了這一科目，似乎是非常不合理的。我敬以這幾點供獻給婦女敎育館。老媽子  修揚　　散寫字間回來，踏進廚房看見妻還是自己做晚餐，我剛想問她薦頭店送人來了沒有，後門外擠進兩個女人來。前面一個胖胖的臉，微弱的燈光下幾乎祇見她塗着厚白粉的鼻子，我正想着什麽地方淆見過那個大鼻子，她已經搶到妻的面前，彷彿打着破銅鑼似的：「奶奶，對不起，對不起，到燒夜飯剛送人來。過年過年，鄉下人都回家過年去了，北海（租界）薦頭店里也沒有人，奶奶是老主顧，我拚着兩條腿從南跑到北，好容易送得來。奶奶你看：」她指着背後</p>

<p>的一個老婦人，「不過年紀大★點，什麽事情都會做，奶奶生阿官，她小衣服也會做的……　　一邊沒有說完，她指着我和妻要那老婦入呌少爺奶奶。我一看新來的女僕，穿着還淸潔整齊。妻要過了年生產，年紀大的總是動作遲慢，妻帮着敷衍過年再呌罷。妻同意了，大的吿訴了她應做的事，留了下來。　　我們這兩個人的小家庭，一些簡單的事妻一個人都做得了，平時我們就沒有僱佣僕人。但是過年時候，因爲親戚朋友來往，總呌個短工來帮過年。那爲頭店里的老闆娘也常常常在我們家裏走動的，本來到年底呌人是很容易的，彷彿做生意似的年底是個收入最好的時候，送禮，喜封，每一個傭人幾乎都靠着過年多賺一點錢。現在因爲妻拖了身體，我們特別早一點呌個帮短工，鄉下剛忙過農事，沒有到上海來，那老闆娘　賣功了，她多要我們四毛車錢。　　新來的傭人做事很勤儉，她似乎懂得很多的，是個老帮傭的。但是上年紀的脾氣太固執，她一件事沒有做完，就不肯接手第二件事，而且動作遲慢，如果有一件緊要事情等着她做，就不能不呌冒火了。妻是性燥的，幾天以後的事她早安排好的，平常沒有傭人的時候，她一個人做着也很應付裕如，現在懐了孕，稍微重大的事她沒有能力做，那老媽子又特別呌人看了性急。　　「荒當里沒有人要，我早知道是個木貨—看了呌人要氣破肚子！」一件事情不如意的時候，妻嘮叨着了。　　我總是勸她耐些性子，自己旣動不來手，又沒有地方呌人，過了年再講吧。　　這樣，那老媽子馬虎地敷衍過了年一。但是過了年更不行了，她做事都懶了下來，妻數說她的時候，她表示不高興做了。記得沒有過中宵節，她偸偸地溜走了。　　這其間我們又呌了一個新傭人，但是也沒有做長。　　現在妻生產了，她母親家里薦來一個傭人，看護產婦，但是我身上的事是沒有功夫兼顧了。於是我們又去請託那個高鼻子的老闆娘。　　當她送人來的時候，出乎意外父是那個溜走了的老媽子，她見了我們祗低着頭玩弄她的衣角，彷彿很難爲情的樣子。老闆娘却又打若她的破銅鑼了，朱恭喜了一陣子：　　「奶奶，我眞什麽都沒有曉得，她（老媽子）現在剛到我店里來說是從奶奶這里溜走的，我馬上駡子她一頓。少爺奶奶都是待傭人很好的，要走也得吿訴一聲，個個人偸偸溜走，我薦頭店還好開嗎？幸虧少爺奶奶大量，要人還是到我店里來，她聽見了又想起少爺奶奶的好處，謝謝少爺奶奶做個好事，就是她再做一時吧。」　　妻在床上祇是閉着眼睛搖頭，我也怕那老媽子會突然發起脾氣來引我妻生氣，我拒絕了高鼻子的耍求，耍她去調一個人來　　老闆娘又說了許多好話，終於領着老媽子走了妻送了她們兩人兩毛錢幾個紅蛋，老媽子紅着眼睛向妻說了句什麽話，但是我們都聽不淸楚。望着她的背影，妻說：「看她現在的樣子，却太可憐了！」房東  王慈　　我的房東是一個在軍艦上做技士的福建入，我相信他是一個有着相當幹練的人物，我第一天搬進那間亭子間的時候，我就跟他攀談了幾句：　　「這兒該沒有臭蟲嗎？」　　「當然當然。」　　「夏來的時候，這裏該有些兒凉風嗎？」　　「當然當然。」　　我就這樣地住了下來，第二天，我就發現了房東的假話，臭蟲委實像一羣飢饉的野獸，翌晨滿身便點綴了許多的紅疹，從此，房東的善良的印象在我意識裏起了動搖，我想縱使我忍得了被臭虫猛嚙的痛苦。我民不該跟這樣一個善於欺騙的人混在一淘，於是，第二天起，我便存心着要搬家。　　可是，日子在不知不覺里一天一天的過去了，生活的鞭策仿佛不允許我對於居信的問題有嫌壞的餘裕；搬家的念頭漸漸地在記憶里消失了。　　我們的前樓是住着一對靑年夫婦，十天以後我便跟他們發生了相當的友好，女人時當會這樣的問我：　　「還住得慣嗎？我們隨時想搬家。」說完，總是苦笑凝留在她的臉上，似乎在說：　　「可憐的孩子！你跟我們一樣的受了騙了。」　　此後，我神經便墮入了恐怖的狀態：我疑心着房束會給予我更大的欺騙，或是更厲害的一種脅迫，於是，我更想搬家，搬家。　　我進去的時候是右五月三日，力月二十日的時候，前樓的一對靑年夫婦眞的搬了，二十一日我們的門口貼上了ｇ　張嶄新的「前樓召租」的紅紙。　　奇怪得很，那對靑年夫婦搬出以後，房東每夜會挨進我的房問，東呀西的跟我閒談，因爲我早跟他懷若鬼胎，越發覺得他的話句句是虛偽，是假。　　他問我有沒有朋友要借房子，徜使由我介紹，可以照價打一個特別的折扣，他吿訴我每月的收入僅僅是三十五元，而這一幢房子他從大房東那邊頂下來就是三十塊，倘使前樓讓他空關着，眞不能生活。　　有一决一個朋友來看我，錯走到了前樓去，房東聽見前樓有脚步的聲音，便急急地上來，以爲我的朋友是來看房子的，等我的朋友說明來意的時候，他又懊喪地躡了下去。　　可是，我還是想搬家。同時，我還担心着房東的生活。　　照理，退房子該在十天以前一對，但是，我心里起了莫明其妙的感覺，我想：　　「倘使對他說了，他會怎樣的恐慌和失望啊！」　　於是，我一天一天的忍耐着，在一月滿期的隔晚，當他照例到我房問里來閒談的時候，我便不能再忍耐下去：　　「我明天預備走了。」　　突如其來的打擊，使他楞住了好久，最後，他跑過來，用着超過一切的愛的態度，猛可地緊握着我的手：　　「王先生，再住一個月不好嗎？」　　「母親有信來，呌我不必再流浪在外邊了。朋友，別懊喪吧！這一個年頭，誰都過不來生活。」　　房東的眼眶里彷彿濕潤了似的，我似乎有些後悔起來。　　翌日，我忽忽地搬家的時候，房東的那個大兒子走來，輕輕地，囁嚅地說　　「王先生」爸爸說房子照規矩該在十天以前退的，你說得遲了，爸爸要你補貼一點損失……」「多少呢」「兩塊！」　　我檢出兩張紙幣，塞在孩子的手裏，撫撫他的頭髮：「孩子，安慰安慰你的爸爸吧——雖然這些錢是救不了那空關着的房子的播音話劇　　海燕劇社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午六時一刻至七時　　走私　　由於某國人的褊護，一走私」在整個國土內蔓延，開去形成稅收上一個極大的損害。然而多數漢奸和浪人，更在某國人的褊護下，極力在做着販私的買賣，道種「趁火打劫」的鈎當在華北已經是明目張胆的深人民間了。　　在北方的某一個小村各裏，數日來，每天都有運私的大騾車打那兒經過，由某國人假裝着毛子押送着。　　這個村落里，幾十年來世代做着餡兒餅的生意，現在，祇剩李玉華一家家了。　　當夜還不甚深的時候，街上已經少有行人了，李玉華急匆匆的從外而走回來。　　「壊了壊了。」的哼着，閂上了門。　　妻驚奇的停着工作問他「什麼事」？　　這又是運私的大騾車打這兒經過了。前些日子打這兒經過時，有人被他們拉了去拉車。李玉華深懼自己會撞到了這樣的事，於是他急忙地把門閂起來而想逃避他被拉去。他的妻也滿以爲這决和上决也許兩樣一點吧！難道大黑晚上間，人山水家裏都有婦女家眷們，他們眞的也會跑來哩？　然而不多時，敲門聲給他們一個證明這班人確是一夜里闖　他倆的家門了。　　聽到道伞玉華非常着急的告訴妻快起來，他的妻却並不在意的開了他們進來了。　　這一伙進了李家之後，他們就無忌的對李妻白般戲謔　敲詐。我這樣吃地，我那樣吃的。　　拿着手鎗威脅着李妻。李妻莫由掙扎的給他么喝着做這樣做那樣。　　因爲白糖泡茶吃得不够了，買雲祥命令他的同伴去偷私糖了。恰巧給頭兒察覺了。頭兒也追上這兒來，於是，李妻看見他把心愛的　文擲碎在他面前的時候，她麻木了似地拿起了桌上的手鎗打死了那個頭兒。　　在這瞬間，村民跟着李玉華到了場，在一陣緊張的情緒中，團結起來不准再叫運私打村子里經過了。特別節目　　誼聲樂社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時半至六時一刻　　連環扣（國樂隊）鴛鴦怨（楊純美）光明之路（陳波鷗）吿別南洋（浦夢古）物別快車（張霞明）浣衣曲（楊純美）漁光曲（鄭淑雲）愛情是什麽（陳洪鷗）逃亡曲（顧廷瑞）彈詞　　何芸芳何琴芳雙珠球　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　徐文璧開篇　　同樂（七二〇）午夜一時至一時三刻　　開篇「三笑夜逃」　　觀音誕日正良辰。美婢嬌實共結　。　子</p>

In the evening, important figures such as Chen Juesheng, Lin Shize, Zhang Zizhong, and Qin Dechun went to Song's residence at No. 17 Road in the British Concession for a meeting that lasted into the night. Due to feeling unwell, Song plans to rest quietly in Tianjin for a few days. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>

Key figures from various agencies were at the station to welcome them. After disembarking, they rested at the Tianjin Municipal Government Garden, where they received guests.

Zhang stated, "I am here to maintain Tianjin on the orders of Chairman Song. As the appointment was sudden, I am not yet fully prepared. I will seek further instructions tonight before making any decisions. Mayor Xiao has achieved considerable success, and I will follow his established policies. In the future, foreign affairs will be handled by a special commissioner of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I am not very clear about this as I have not dealt with it before. After taking office, I will visit Tashiro, Matsumuro, and Naganami for discussions." (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan left Beiping for Tianjin this afternoon. Before his departure, he convened a meeting at his private residence with leading local military and political figures such as Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, and Liu Ruming. In addition to visiting his relatives, Song's trip to Tianjin will also include inspecting the military and political situation and the local people's conditions in Jinghai and Cangxian counties near Tianjin.

Zhang Zizhong is scheduled to assume the position of Tianjin mayor tomorrow. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin Mayor Xiao Zhenying had repeatedly requested to resign from his position to Song. Song convened a meeting of 29th Army cadres at his private residence last night and decided to approve Xiao's resignation as Tianjin mayor. Zhang Zizhong was appointed to act in his place, and Liu Ruming was appointed to succeed as Chairman of Chahar Province. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council issued orders early this morning for them to assume their positions and telegraphed the central government for formal appointments. After receiving the order, Zhang left for Tianjin this afternoon. Zhang stated, "Mayor Xiao insisted on resigning. Song, considering the importance of Tianjin, felt that it was essential to have someone responsible in charge, and specially telegraphed the central government to recommend me as the next mayor of Tianjin. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council ordered me to assume office immediately. After arriving in Tianjin, I will go to the municipal government to take charge. The national government's order should be formally announced within days." Liu Ruming stated, "Having been appointed to lead Chahar, I am scheduled to leave Beiping for Zhangjiakou to assume my post within two or three days." (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Ruming is scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou tomorrow morning to assume his position as Chairman of Chahar. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Before leaving for Tianjin, Song Zheyuan issued a handwritten instruction stating, "As I, the Chairman, am away on official business, all routine matters within the council will be handled by Secretary-General Ge Dingyuan, who will open and act on my behalf."

(17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After Zhang Zizhong arrived here, Song Zheyuan and Qin Dechun arrived one after another in a special train. It is now believed that Song will stay here for a few days and then inspect the inland areas, perhaps even visiting his hometown of Leling on the border of Shandong. (17th Reuters News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan traveled to Tianjin by car at 3:00 PM this afternoon with Qin Dechun. Although this trip is ostensibly to visit his elderly mother, well-informed sources believe that its true purpose is to meet with the Japanese army authorities in Tianjin. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council has issued an official order appointing Zhang Zizhong as the Tianjin mayor, and Liu Ruming, commander of the 25th Army, will fill the vacancy left by him as the Chairman of Chahar. This appointment is awaiting central government approval. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, came to Nanjing from Guangdong on the orders of Chen Jitang and Lin Yun'kai to pay his respects to the central authorities and explain the recent situation in Guangdong Province. After arriving in Nanjing, Feng Rui immediately met with Wang Chonghui to explain the recent situation in Guangdong Province in detail.

He also gave an explanation on the current situation. The reporter visited Feng at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, and Feng was preparing to meet with Chairman Chiang. Due to the short time, only a very brief conversation was held. According to him, Chen Jitang and Lin Yun'kai are currently engaging in various local construction projects according to their proposed three-year construction plan, hoping to complete them within the scheduled period. Therefore, they do not want to participate in other issues. Recently, after Chen Jitang received the orders from the central government, he immediately ordered the deployment of various troops to return to their original defenses and is now in the process of demobilization. There will be no other problems in the future. Many of the rumors circulating outside are fabricated by certain parties and are not accurate. It is hoped that the people of the country will not be misled. Regarding the withdrawal of the Guangdong troops according to the orders of the central government, Chen Jitang has recently telegraphed Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to report. His visit to the north, in addition to discussing issues such as sugar cane and the currency system in Guangdong Province with the financial authorities, also carries the orders of Chen and Lin to go to Beijing to explain the recent situation in Guangdong Province to Chairman Chiang and the various authorities, as well as Chen and Lin's determination to support the central government in their efforts to build up the local areas, and to hope that the central government will provide assistance so that they can complete various construction projects.

<h3>Quickly Determine a Plan to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the Guangdong-Guangxi armies from southern Hunan, the situation has become more relaxed. As long as both sides meet with sincerity, although there may be differences in emphasis and urgency on diplomatic issues, a common path to resolution can ultimately be found with the shared goal of saving the nation. This will then allow a unified approach to dealing with the unprecedented foreign aggression. In recent weeks, the people of the nation have been focused on the disturbances in the domestic situation, while the pressure from foreign forces has been increasing daily. Just look at the situation in North China today - is there anything that is not shocking?</p>
<p>We can learn a most valuable lesson from this period of disturbance: the more divided domestic opinions are, the more opportunities there are for foreign forces to exert pressure. Conversely, if the nation has effective measures to deal with foreign aggression, not only can national opinion and strength be concentrated, but the pressure from foreign forces can also be naturally reduced. The differences in opinion between the central government and Guangdong-Guangxi lie in the question of how to save the nation. What the people of the nation hope for from the central government is to quickly determine a practical plan to save the nation and unite the will and strength of the nation by responding to foreign aggression. The past mistakes in our country's diplomacy have been that we have been completely controlled and passively reacting. We have been treating the symptoms rather than the cause, while others have been deliberately plotting to undermine us with organization and steps, constantly using the established facts they have created to blackmail and set conditions. Because of accommodating the status quo, our country's diplomacy has become reversed. We must wait until a plan to save the nation is determined before we can talk about active and independent diplomacy, and only then can Foreign Minister Zhang's words "seek self-existence in the country and co-existence in the international community" be realized.</p>
<p>The invasion of foreign powers is pressing closer and closer. Now the central government has decided to convene the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on July 10 to gather the nation's talents and discuss the plan to save the nation. We not only hope that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities can personally come to Beijing to attend and present their views, but also hope that this meeting will have practical resolutions that clearly inform the nation that, at this critical moment, we absolutely cannot afford to delay or procrastinate.</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Resolves to Lift Sanctions Against Italy</h3>
<p>House of Commons to Debate Foreign Policy Today; Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Will Announce Their Positions</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a meeting this afternoon and decided that the sanctions against Italy should be lifted. (17th Day Havas News Agency Urgent Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) When the Cabinet holds its weekly meeting today, it will formally decide to advocate the lifting of sanctions against Italy. However, the United Kingdom can only do this if the consensus in Geneva is the same. Cabinet members have now agreed to this policy in principle. What is not yet known is the attitude of the autonomous territories, especially because South African Federal Prime Minister Hertzog reiterated last night that South Africa is determined to continue to support the sanctions policy.</p>
<p>At the same time, observers are now paying attention to what impact the initiative to lift sanctions will have on Italy's foreign policy. According to dispatches from Rome, although the lifting of sanctions can now be guaranteed to become a reality, the political circles are unwilling to discuss the issue of Italian cooperation in Europe until the member states of the League of Nations formally announce the lifting of sanctions. Therefore, even if the British House of Commons announces tomorrow that the United Kingdom will propose the lifting of sanctions against Italy in Geneva, Italy will not participate in the meeting to be held in Montreux on June 22 to consider Turkey's application to allow it to rebuild defensive works in the Dardanelles Strait, because it is expected that sanctions cannot be lifted before June 22. As for whether Italy is satisfied with the lifting of sanctions, or whether it will seek to repeal the League of Nations' judgment that Italy is an aggressor, it is not yet known. However, Italian observers now have no doubts that the Italian government will ultimately agree to fully cooperate with other countries in European politics. (17th Day Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons debates the government's foreign policy on Thursday, special attention will be paid to the issue of sanctions against Italy. Foreign Secretary Eden will speak first to begin the debate. At the end of the debate, Prime Minister Baldwin will also rise to speak. Leaders of the opposition parties will all participate in the debate. It is said that Lloyd George, who has not participated in the parliamentary debate for a long time, will also express his political views on that day. (16th Day Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Right-wing member of parliament Soullier proposed a motion today to advocate the lifting of sanctions against Italy, but left-wing members of parliament will probably oppose the motion, so that the government can freely negotiate the cost of lifting sanctions. It is now believed that Foreign Minister Taubas will be able to reach a consensus with British Foreign Secretary Eden on the issue of sanctions when they meet. After that, Soviet Russia will probably also take the same steps as Britain and France. France is currently said to be willing to strengthen the League of Nations. (16th Day Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee met late last night. All cabinet members present agreed to the lifting of sanctions, and decided on the general outline of the speech to be delivered by Foreign Secretary Eden when the House of Commons meets (on the 18th). It is generally believed that Eden will not only advocate the lifting of sanctions at that time, but also mention the issue of reorganizing the League of Nations, but will only state the general principles without going into details. If opposition members of parliament ask questions, Prime Minister Baldwin will respond. As for the plan to reorganize the League of Nations, it is currently being drafted by officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that its content focuses on the principle of regional organization of security agencies. (16th Day Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendation on the lifting of sanctions will be submitted to the Parliament by the Cabinet tomorrow. Sir Rosemier today forced Foreign Secretary Eden and Viscount Saul to resign immediately, because prudence is indeed valuable, but prudence to the point of cowardice is not a way to protect oneself. This decision by the Cabinet is extremely absurd. Labor Party opposition leader Attlee declared that he would propose a discussion of the government's foreign policy in the House of Commons on Thursday. It is said that the famous Conservative Party member Wigan has agreed to support this motion. However, in order to make it easier for those who love the League of Nations to accept its lifting of sanctions, the government guarantees that it will not recognize Italy's conquest of Abyssinia. According to observers familiar with current affairs, the British government's decision was actually caused by the turbulent European situation. (16th Day Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain delivered a speech on the 10th of this month advocating the lifting of sanctions, our reporter has learned that Chamberlain's remarks were not only not contradictory to the views held by Foreign Secretary Eden, but also revealed the arguments held by Eden in a faithful manner. However, Chamberlain revealed it to the outside world before the time was ripe, which is what Foreign Secretary Eden was unhappy about. According to reports, Chamberlain had a long talk with Eden before delivering the speech. At that time, Eden told Chamberlain the views he held and which had been endorsed by the Cabinet. These views included: Agreeing to lift sanctions; Not recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia; Reorganizing the League of Nations. Eden believes that in view of the various evolutions in international politics in recent months, British foreign policy must be redefined. He originally planned to personally state this to the Parliament, but Chamberlain revealed it immediately, making Eden's position quite difficult. (16th Day Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>South African Federation Always Supports the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Australian Government Advocates Lifting Sanctions</p>
<p>Cape Town When South African Federal Prime Minister Hertzog spoke in Parliament today, he said that if we are not loyal to the League of Nations simply because other countries will not be loyal to the League of Nations, it is not the right way. If countries such as Britain and France do not want to cope with the possible consequences of continuing sanctions against Italy, it has nothing to do with South Africa. South Africa still has to support the League of Nations to the end. If the League of Nations fails because its members do not respect their obligations, there will be a world war in less than twenty years. (16th Day Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>New Gold Mountain The Australian Federal Government telegraphed Bruce, its chief official stationed in the United Kingdom, today, saying that the Australian Federal Government agrees to lift sanctions against Italy. (16th Day Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Conditions for Italy's Re-participation in European Cooperation; Not Satisfied with the Cancellation of Sanctions; Italian Ambassador Visits French Foreign Minister for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italian Ambassador Seruti visited Foreign Minister Taubas yesterday and had discussions. Paris's newspaper, "Echo", journalist Beltina, commented on this matter, saying, "According to news from certain sources, the Italian government does not seem to be satisfied with the lifting of sanctions. It seems to mean that if Italy is to re-participate in various European issues, the League of Nations must abandon the principle of 'not recognizing the situation created by war.'" The journalist Tabui of the newspaper "Business" also published an article, saying that when the League of Nations General Assembly and the Executive Yuan hold meetings, France will return to the position of supporter of the League of Nations alliance. If Britain advocates the complete lifting of the current sanctions, the French representative will have to make a speech to declare that the country will remain steadfast in its collective policy and various resolutions that the countries jointly adopted in Geneva. As for the method of the authorities of major countries making decisions independently, France cannot agree to it. However, at the same time, it will still declare that if Britain lifts sanctions, France will naturally follow suit, because although France formally expresses its opposition to the lifting of sanctions, it does not sincerely want it to be realized. (17th Day Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Many newspapers have recently published reports saying that Italy is not satisfied with the lifting of sanctions and intends to go a step further and demand that the League of Nations General Assembly revoke the declaration it made in October of last year that Italy was an aggressor. Only then can Italy cooperate with other countries again on international events. People from the Italian side here said that this news is not accurate. (16th Day Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Italian newspaper published an editorial today praising Germany's attitude towards Italy. According to observers familiar with current affairs, Mussolini's hope is not only for the League of Nations to lift sanctions, but also to mediate the conflict between France and Germany, so as to enhance Italy's position in Europe.

<h3>Italy Carries Out War Preparations; Believes that the International Situation is Far from Peaceful</h3>
<p>(Rome) Although Britain has inclined to lift sanctions against Italy, Italy is still accelerating its war preparations. Fascist cadres are now working hard to organize new combatants and train young people across the country. In addition, it has been decided to allocate 100,000 guns for the use of fascist youth organizations, and give party membership to veterans who have contributed to the conquest of Abyssinia. Moreover, Mussolini has clearly told fascist cadres that the current international situation is far from peaceful. (16th Day Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Still Regards Malta as Its Main Naval Port</h3>
<p>Preparing to Strengthen Defenses Against Possible Attacks</p>
<p>(London) Foreign countries recently have rumors that the British government is now discussing not using Malta as a naval base. Today, Navy Minister Chen Er replied to questions from Conservative Party member of parliament Guest in the Upper House and confirmed this statement, saying that the Navy Department still intends to use Malta as the main naval base in the Mediterranean, and does not intend to abandon the headquarters of the Mediterranean Fleet. It is now only discussing various effective methods to strengthen the port's defenses so that it can resist possible attacks. (17th Day Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Major Changes to Italian Ambassadors Abroad; Awaiting Final Approval from Mussolini</h3>
<p>(Rome) It was learned here today that a major reshuffle of thirty-five ambassadors abroad could be announced immediately, but because it still needs the approval of Prime Minister Mussolini, there may be changes in the meantime, so it will have to wait a little longer. According to this plan, the current ambassador to the United States, Luo Su, will be transferred to the post of ambassador to Russia, and the vacant post will be filled by the current foreign affairs director, Su Weishu. The current ambassador to the United Kingdom, Gran Di, and the ambassador to France, Seruxi, will remain in their original posts. Sir Arosi will also continue to be the chief representative attending the Geneva Conference, but in the event of important discussions, the new Foreign Minister Qi Yano may personally come forward.

<p>Buenos Aires Some senators planned to ask the government about Argentina's attitude towards the League of Nations.

<h3>London Residents Worried about Germany's Ambition to Move East</h3>
<p>Berlin Daily Publishes an Article to Correct It; The Treaty of Non-Aggression Aims at Peace</p>
<p>(Berlin) There have recently been concerns in the UK that Germany may invade the Soviet Union. A famous German journalist, Xia Fo, recently published an article in the Berlin Daily to correct it, saying, "Germany submitted a memorandum to the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact on March 31, containing various peace proposals, one of which advocated the conclusion of mutual non-aggression pacts with its neighboring countries. If Germany were to invade the Soviet Union in the future, it would have to destroy this mutual non-aggression agreement first. May I ask if Germany would be willing to do this? This is enough to prove that Germany's proposal to conclude this agreement can indeed maintain peace. In regional pacts, preventive measures can only be used when there is an unprovoked act of aggression in the international community, and the outcome is unpredictable. This is why Germany has not dared to agree to it." (17th Day Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Invoking the Escalator Clause: Britain to Increase Naval Strength</h3>
<p>Recent Talks Show US and Japan Agree That Germany's Fortifications on Heligoland Are a Threat</p>
<p>(London) According to naval expert Mr. Pei Huade, the British government will soon invoke the escalator clause of the 1930 London Naval Treaty to increase its current limited destroyer strength of 150,000 tons. Judging from recent discussions, the United States and Japan both agree with this proposal, allowing each to increase their tonnage ratios equally. Naval experts believe that recent naval developments in various countries provide sufficient reason for Britain to invoke the escalator clause of the London Naval Treaty. Mr. Pei also stated that Germany is now resuming large-scale military fortifications on Heligoland, as before. German Chancellor Hitler recently inspected the ongoing construction during a naval cruise to the island. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Heligoland should never be militarized.

<h3>Japanese Naval Policy Emphasizes Increasing Submarines, To Be Implemented Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) With the naval treaty expiring next year, the Japanese Navy has decided to establish a new military armament plan aimed at maintaining control of the sea in the West Pacific, to be implemented starting next year. The expansion and strengthening of submarines is a traditional policy of the Japanese Navy and preparations are already underway. At the London Conference, the Japanese Navy advocated maintaining 78,500 tons of submarines, but as a result of the insistence of Britain, the United States, and other countries on abolishing or reducing submarine tonnage, it was limited to 52,700 tons. With the recent situation moving towards an era without treaties, a sudden expansion of submarine capabilities is being implemented. The United States is building cruiser submarines such as the "Torell" and "Dolphin," and Britain is building the cruiser submarine "X-1," all with significant tonnage, power, and capabilities. The Soviet Union is also concentrating 44 submarines in Vladivostok. Therefore, Japan has no choice but to increase its submarine forces. (Domei, 17th)</p>
<h3>German Minister of Economic Affairs Arrives in Hungarian Capital by Plane</h3>
<p>The Goal of Touring Southeast European Countries is to Develop Political and Economic Relations</p>
<p>Budapest The German Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank, Mr. and Mrs. Schacht, arrived here at 11:20 this morning on their private plane from the Bulgarian capital. The President of the Hungarian National Bank, Mr. Inke, and diplomatic personnel welcomed them at the airport. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria After meeting with the President of the Bulgarian National Bank, Mr. Bozhilov, the German Minister of Economic Affairs and President of the Central Bank, Dr. Schacht, told reporters, "Mr. Bozhilov and I are in complete agreement on all the issues discussed, which I am pleased to report to you. The close relationship between the German Central Bank and the Bulgarian National Bank will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the development of political and economic relations between the two countries. Germany is now prepared to assist Bulgaria in developing its resources, including mineral resources, which we are happy to do." A reporter asked Schacht, "It is said that there are gold mines in Bulgaria, is Germany interested in this?" Schacht replied, "Bulgaria can keep gold for its own use. What Germany is interested in is metal ore that can be used for industrial purposes. Don't think that we Germans can only survive by relying on the assistance of others. Our original economic system has already disappeared. In the future, even without financial resources, our country will be able to survive, because the way for a country to survive is not in money, but in the will of the people." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>French Minister of Finance Opposes Franc Devaluation</h3>
<p>Economic Recovery Can Only Be Achieved by Raising Prices, and Short-Term Inflation Is Unavoidable</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet will submit a bill to the parliament tomorrow proposing to reorganize the Bank of France. Minister of Finance Auriol will also deliver a speech explaining the current financial situation. He gave a statement to reporters this afternoon, reiterating his opposition to the proposal to devalue the franc, saying, "What the French economy is suffering from is a shortage of 25,000,000,000 francs in paper currency circulation, as well as 20,000,000,000 francs in gold, which are either hidden by the people or have flowed out of the country. This huge sum can only be recirculated after the economy recovers. The only way to revive the economy is to raise domestic prices. However, the impact of rising prices and wages will inevitably be both beneficial and detrimental. In other words, adjusting the economy must go through a transitional period, which is unavoidable. The only solution now is to implement a short-term inflationary policy, that is, a three-month inflationary policy," to force capital to circulate as much as possible. As for rumors that the government may force the people to exchange public bonds, this is not certain. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>French Senate Discusses Labor Law</h3>
<p>(Paris) The rapporteur of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Garte, reported today that the committee does not approve of Blum's new social law, and indicated that the French government may have to adopt a strict plan to reserve sufficient gold for national defense purposes. It is said that the committee did not oppose the passage of Blum's bill only out of respect for the wishes expressed in the general election. The gold reserves of the Bank of France have been reduced to 56,000,000,000 francs, forcing us to consider the minimum level required for national defense. The current budget deficit is estimated to be 12,000,000,000 francs, not including the new expenses of the Blum government. At the same time, the authorities have begun to closely monitor the French people to stop the outflow of gold and silver. According to officials of the French airline, passengers leaving Le Bourget airport must now declare whether they are carrying gold or silver, and their luggage is also subject to inspection.

<h3>Bank of England Purchases Huge Amounts of Gold, Aiming to Increase Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>(London) The Bank of England purchased gold worth £1,200,000 yesterday and again purchased gold worth £1,400,000 today. This is the largest purchase in the past three years and has attracted much attention in financial circles here. Since the beginning of this year, the Bank of England has purchased a total of £11,500,000 worth of gold. Because the Bank of England is still purchasing at the old price of 85 shillings per ounce, the gold purchased is worth £18,000,000 at the current market price. It is believed that the Exchange Equalisation Fund is the main seller, in order to dispose of its excessively accumulated gold reserves. The purpose of the Bank of England's purchase is to increase its gold reserves to prevent foreigners from buying British banknotes and hoarding them, which will greatly increase the amount of banknotes in circulation.

The French labor delegation to the International Labor Conference immediately protested, saying, "There is no reason for the Geneva authorities to do this." Mr. Shi Wu also told reporters from this agency that he intended to explain the internal situation in France in an objective manner and did not want to cause any accidents in other countries.

<h3>Labor Unrest in Belgium is Serious; Prime Minister Summons Representatives of Labor and Management for Mediation</h3>
<p>Brussels The labor unrest in Belgium is still complex. However, the most important labor and management groups will hold a representative meeting today, chaired by Prime Minister Cyrille, which may lead to a peaceful solution to the labor unrest. Liege is still the most turbulent center of unrest. Most of the strikers are miners, but they have not adopted the tactic of staying at the factory without working. Since the riots occurred, several armed vehicles with machine guns have been patrolling the streets of the town. Early this morning, strikers tried to overturn trucks carrying milk. Shortly thereafter, they attempted to attack an experimental station of a small armory, but were dispersed by the police and 15 people were arrested. At noon, strikers spread throughout the city, trying to obstruct traffic, but were dispersed by the police several times and dispersed. All the hardware stores in Liege are closed today, but the public did not find this unusual because Wednesday is the employees' day off. The mayor has now banned the riding of bicycles. Almost all the workers in the port of Ghent are on strike. They now want to receive the same concessions as the workers in Antwerp, with a daily wage increase of two shillings and no work beyond the prescribed hours. As a result of the strike by port workers in Antwerp, 4,500 trucks loaded with goods cannot move. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Syria and Lebanon Merge to Form an Independent Republic</h3>
<p>Of the Same Nature as Iraq, Concluding an Alliance Treaty with France</p>
<p>(Paris) Renowned journalist Bertina recently published news in the Paris Daily News, stating that delegations from Syria and Lebanon, mandated territories of France by the League of Nations (both in Western Asia, belonging to Class A mandated territories), recently arrived here. Last night, they held an important meeting with foreign affairs authorities at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The discussions concerned the merger of the two regions into an independent republic and the conclusion of an alliance treaty with France. The republic will be named the Near East State, and the alliance treaty will be signed separately by France with Syria and Lebanon. Negotiations on the conclusion of the treaty have already begun and a draft will soon be prepared and approved by the cabinet. Once the Near East State is established, Syria and Lebanon will no longer be French mandated territories, similar to the situation in 1932 when Iraq became an independent country from being a British mandated territory. The Near East State will join the League of Nations as a member state during the League of Nations General Assembly in September. Mrs. Tabui also published an article in the Business Report, commenting on this matter, saying, "The realization of the organization of an independent republic in Syria and Lebanon will be the first diplomatic achievement of the Leon Blum cabinet since taking office, and it will be clear evidence that the policy pursued by France is to promote the principles of equality and justice contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations throughout the world." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to responsible sources here today, negotiations between France and the two independent republics of Syria and Lebanon on the conclusion of an alliance have begun at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, due to the need to study many complex matters, the negotiations cannot be completed in a short time. It is said that the treaty still needs to be drafted and must be approved by the League of Nations Mandates Commission before the matter can be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly. Therefore, the two countries are unlikely to join the League of Nations as member states before 1937. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Oxford University in England Establishes a Professorship for Chinese Scholars</h3>
<p>A Wealthy Person Generously Donates a Large Sum to Make This Happen</p>
<p>(London) Wealthy couple Mr. and Mrs. Spielting have decided to establish a professorship for Chinese-born scholars at Oxford University in England, with a term of three years and an annual salary of £400. This is the same as the salaries of other professorships at Oxford, but is different from university professors of any other nationality. Currently, the highest professorship salary is £500 per year. Mr. Xu Shi, a professor of Chinese at Oxford, told a Reuters reporter today that Oxford should become the highest center for the study of Chinese culture. The new lecturer will specifically focus on translating Chinese philosophical and religious texts and giving regular lectures. Mr. and Mrs. Shi have never visited China, but they are very interested in Chinese culture. They generously donated a large sum to establish a professorship in Eastern religion and ethics at Oxford and have done much to improve the social well-being of Chinese students. The new lecturer will likely be hired from China. We hope to find someone from among the young scholars at the most complete universities in China. We are currently considering the resumes of two or three people, but no decision has been made yet. Travel expenses will of course be provided separately. We hope that the lecturer can start working in October of this year. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

He expressed confidence that the foundation of the Philippine Islands would continue to strengthen. After praising US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Murphy, he stated that the relationship between the Philippines and the United States had never been as friendly as it is today. Quezon advocated for severe punishment for those who smuggle weapons and endanger the country.

<h3>The Mystery of the German Military Aircraft Accident</h3>
<p>The Berlin Aviation Department Remains Tight-Lipped, While Denmark Speaks Unequivocally</p>
<p>(London) After news of the crash of a German military seaplane in the Skagerrak Strait was transmitted from Copenhagen, Berlin Aviation Department immediately denied it. A dispatch from Copenhagen stated that the aircraft crashed into the sea while participating in a major German naval exercise in the Skagerrak Strait, and that all seven people on board died. The German authorities kept the news secret. When an official from the Berlin Aviation Department was asked about the matter, he completely denied it. However, Denmark firmly insisted that the incident did occur. People near a fish market in the town of Skagen claimed that they witnessed a torpedo boat retrieving a destroyed aircraft, and that German ships participating in the exercise flew their flags at half-mast for a moment.

<h3>Palestinian Strike Leaders Arrested</h3>
<p>Fifteen People Detained in Detention Camps</p>
<p>Jerusalem Although several bombing and shooting incidents occurred in Palestine last night, the situation was relatively calm. The silence of the rioters should not be regarded as a sign of improvement in the overall situation, as new riots often break out after a period of calm. Fifteen more Arab leaders and agitators have been sent to the new concentration camp in Sarafand. Among them is a Muslim employee of the Haifa Municipal Government. It is said that people in Iraq and Egypt are raising donations to support the Palestinian Arab strike movement. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem The authorities established a detention camp between this city and Jaffa Port due to the unrest in the area, detaining the arrested instigators in the camp and preventing them from engaging in any activities. Fifteen more people were arrested and detained in the camp today. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem The situation in Palestine has not improved. Tomorrow is a Muslim holiday, and it is said that some Arabs intend to take the opportunity to hold religious demonstrations to commemorate the dead, which has caused great unease in the Jewish-populated areas. More and more Jews have been leaving the Old City to take refuge elsewhere. Several prominent Arab figures have also fled to Egypt and Lebanon. In addition, the various newspapers run by Arabs have resumed publication today. It is reported that several prominent figures from the Arab community will arrive here from Iraq soon to voice their support for their fellow Arabs. The mayor of Haifa (an Arab) and the Arab members of the city council have recently resigned. The city will be managed by a special committee appointed by the authorities, and the position of mayor will be filled by the deputy mayor, a Jew. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>US Republican Presidential Candidate Begins Campaign</h3>

<p>Topeka, USA Republican presidential candidate Landon and vice-presidential candidate Knox declared in front of the Kansas State Capitol today, amid military music and cheers from the crowd, that they would strive hard during this presidential election campaign. Mr. Knox arrived today, welcomed by marching troops, veterans, and local officials. Several members of the Republican Executive Committee accompanied him. They were quite optimistic about the Republican Party's election prospects. (Kuo Min, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Thomas, leader of the inflation faction in the Senate, attacked Republican presidential candidate Landon today, saying that his platform advocates maintaining existing prices, but what the people need is higher prices, more money, and a better life. Therefore, the money issue will be the most important point of contention in this presidential election campaign, and the focus of the contention is the Republican Party's opposition to further currency devaluation. Landon explained the Republican Party's platform on currency issues, stating that he wants to restore the discredited gold standard as soon as possible to maintain existing prices. However, history has proven that sufficient money and high prices mean prosperity. Although President Roosevelt has devalued the dollar, compared with pre-war prices, one dollar is currently worth one dollar and twenty-eight cents at that time. Thomas was quite in favor of the exchange value of the dollar, but its domestic value still needs to be reduced. The gold and silver currently stored in the United States are sufficient to issue new coins worth 600 billion yuan. After the issuance, there will still be a full reserve. Democratic Senator Tydings also complained that the Republican Party had failed to advocate international monetary stability, because if other countries further devalue their currencies, the Republican Party will find it difficult to abide by its platform of opposing devaluation.

<h3>Switzerland Strengthens National Defense</h3>
<p>Intended to Prevent German Troops from Passing Through to Attack France</p>
<p>(London) The Swiss Federal Government recently submitted a bill to the parliament requesting approval to allocate 235,000,000 Swiss francs for the cost of strengthening national defense. The liberal newspaper Mengquesde Bao Wei Bao recently commented on this matter, saying that the German General Staff now believes that it is not advisable for German troops to attack France by passing through Belgium, but that it is more convenient to invade Switzerland. The reason why the Swiss government is seeking to strengthen its national defense lies here. "If German troops were to invade Belgium, Britain would inevitably intervene. In addition, Belgium's military strength is now quite strong, far from what it was in 1914. The German General Staff is fully aware of this. Therefore, Germany's western border, south from the area bordering Basel, Switzerland, and north to the Dutch border, is now building a defense line to rival France's eastern Maginot Line (named after the former French Minister of War). Once the project is completed, a small number of troops can be stationed to guard the west without worry. Then, the main force can be transferred to attack northern Switzerland with all its strength, so as to use that place as the main position to attack France." (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>Warsaw Members of the National Socialist Party in the Free City of Danzig have recently clashed with local opposition parties, resulting in many deaths and injuries. According to news from the city, the opposition parties issued a joint declaration, saying that the National Socialist Party is now planning to create a fait accompli to change the constitution of the Free City, thereby provoking conflicts for its own selfish purposes. All opposition parties are determined to safeguard the current constitution of the city and urge the people to remain calm and not allow the conspirators to succeed. This declaration has been published by several newspapers, but the city authorities confiscated all the newspapers. In addition, a member of the National Socialist Party's assault team, Mr. Tesgoski, was killed on the spot during the clashes last Saturday. The party is scheduled to hold a funeral for the deceased tomorrow and hold a demonstration. Several members of the German National Socialist Party will travel from Berlin to the city to attend the funeral. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructs Four Banks to Assist People in Distinguishing Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance recently sent a letter to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, stating that according to Wang Weimin of Sutongtai, now that legal tender is circulating in rural areas, counterfeit currency is inevitable. The ignorant villagers are easily deceived, and it is proposed that each bank be ordered to establish a legal tender identification center in each county and towns adjacent to rural areas, or to order local bank offices to assist the people in identifying the authenticity of banknotes as much as possible, so as to prevent the people from being innocently harmed. The Ministry of Finance has determined that the villagers' inability to distinguish the authenticity of legal tender and the fact that they are often deceived is indeed the case. In addition to the fact that the request to establish a legal tender identification center is not suitable, the verification of authenticity should be earnestly carried out by the banks and their branches at the beginning of the implementation of legal tender. For legitimate legal entities in various places, branches can adopt more model coupons for hanging to facilitate identification and prevent innocent damage to the people. If counterfeit currency is found, the source should be investigated and reported to the government for investigation and punishment. (17th, Central News Agency telegram)</p>

<h3>Cantonese Currency Devaluation, Rice and Grain Price Increases</h3>
<p>—General Situation in the Chao-Shan Area—</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In recent days, rumors have been rife in Chao-Shan, and the price of Guangdong legal tender has plummeted. On the 10th, the exchange rate was over 1,780 Guangdong legal tender per 1,000 Hong Kong dollars, and over 1,660 Guangdong legal tender per 1,000 Central Ocean dollars. Judging from the foreign exchange rate, the price of Guangdong legal tender is likely to continue to fall. Although the Ministry of Finance has issued an order prohibiting speculation and stipulated that the statutory price of Hong Kong dollar discount is 725, each bank still has handling fees outside the legal price. The black market exchange rate is different from the official exchange rate, and registering futures trading does not help. According to a staff member of the Shantou Provincial Branch, the total amount of legal tender issued in Guangdong Province is 178 million yuan, which is sufficient for circulation in various counties. There are still more than 70 remote counties that have not sent personnel to purchase, and there are at least 100 million yuan of cash in circulation among the people. The Shantou Customs Post Office converts Guangdong legal tender at the market price every day. Each Guangdong Ocean dollar can buy 65 cents of stamps, and each Guangdong fractional dollar can buy 100 cents. Customs tax revenue is based on the legal tender of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications. For small amounts, each dime is collected as 18 cents of Guangdong fractional currency. These conversions show that the Guangdong currency has been devalued in recent days. Since foreign exchange has risen so much, the prices of rice, grain, and all goods have also doubled. People who live on salaries have lost half of their income in an invisible way. The more goods merchants sell, the more they lose. According to the investigation, last month's rice price was 12 catties per yuan, but this month it is only 6.5 catties. The reason for the high price of rice is not that merchants are raising prices to make profits, but because merchants who sell rice on credit will still lose money if they sell Hong Kong dollars and remit them to Hong Kong at this time. Because the goods sold before could have hoped to make a small profit, but today even a small profit is not possible. In this step-by-step decline, merchants have no choice but to stop handling goods and importing them, and wait for the opportunity.</p>

<p>(19) The Xiangyang Dike Project after the Flood</p>
<p>Xiangyang is located at the junction of the Han River. The waters of the Tang, Bai, Gun, and Qing rivers all converge here and flow south. Because the river is narrow, the flow is rapid, and it is a sandy river with no fixed channel, the waves are turbulent and the force is like a downpour whenever the water rises in summer. Therefore, the people regard the dike as their life, especially the Old Dragon Dike as the greatest guarantee, followed by the city dike, the Xiangqu South Dike, Xinglong, Wangjiawa, Zhangjiawan, Qinghe, Shuanggou, and other civil dikes, as well as the Xingxingguan and Jitou of Fancheng, each of which has its own importance. Last year's flood caused each of the dikes to breach, with more than 20 breaches in the city wall of Xiangyang and the complete collapse of the city wall of Fancheng. All four townships became a vast lake. The total area flooded in the county was about 6,000 square li, with more than 20,000 people drowned and twice as many dying from epidemics. The loss of agricultural cotton and grain was 50 million yuan, the loss of real estate was 20 million yuan, and more than 3,000 mu of farmland was covered with sand, resulting in a loss of 4 million yuan. The entire city of Fancheng was submerged, and the essence was lost. The survivors of the disaster change color when they talk about the water, and when they hear the order to repair the dike, they all rush to work enthusiastically. As a result, the city dike, Zhangjiawan, Wangjiawa, Xinglong, Qinghe, Yongan, Jiahe, Shuanggou, and other civil dikes were completed quickly, whether it was work relief or conscript labor. However, the Old Dragon Dike, which is listed as the main dike, was repaired by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the project was very slow. The dike is also called the Great Dike. Li Bai has a poem about the Great Dike of Xiangyang, which shows that the construction is very ancient. The dike is located west of the city, bordering the Han River to the north, and is eleven li long. It has never breached before, but last year it breached four times. Initially, the dike project funds were collected from the Zhongxiang boat donation at a rate of six percent, called the six percent donation. Later, it was cut off. The government and the people did not consider repairing and defending the dike because they were confident that the dike was strong enough, and it eventually breached. After the breach, Shi Dupei, the chief engineer of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, came to Xiangyang to assess the damage and formulated a repair plan, adopting the latest engineering methods to increase the height and thickness. The entire dike was divided into five sections, A, B, C, D, and E, from Wanshan to the city corner, from the city corner to Xiaobeimen, from Xiaobeimen to Dabeimen, from Dabeimen to Changmen, and from Changmen to the sluice. Sections A and C, and Section B within the old city wall, were all built with earth. The breach in Section B was repaired using a new method, with a stone-paved foot groove and a stone-paved slope, and rubble and wire cages were thrown in. The order of the project was to repair sections A, D, and E first, estimating 90,000 cubic meters of earth and 6,000 cubic meters of stone, with a cost of 160,000 yuan. The bureau established an engineering office and sent technician Chen Pu to preside over it. Construction began in early February during the agricultural slack season and was completed before the peach flood. Unexpectedly, after Chen arrived at the site, he colluded with local officials and gentry and shared the spoils together, resulting in all kinds of malpractices. On the engineering side, it was neither a completely contracted system nor self-employed construction. Instead, it was unofficially contracted to government officials and local gentry, who then subcontracted it themselves, resulting in unclear authority, buck-passing, delayed progress, and strong criticism from the public. The provincial government, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the Lianghu Supervision Envoy's Office all sent inspectors to investigate, and their wheels never stopped on the road. The reporter also went to the dike to investigate. The shortcomings of the project were said to be that the ramming work was reduced without authorization in violation of regulations, the dike body was too loose, and cracks appeared as soon as it was repaired. The slope was too thin, only nine inches thick when it was supposed to be one and a half feet. After being corrected by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau committee, the upper end was built to the specified size, but the lower layer had already disappeared into the water and could not be thickened, forming a top-heavy situation. The foot groove project and the small sluice project were too sloppy. The quarry was originally stipulated to be in Wanshan, and it would cost eight yuan per cubic foot to transport it to the work site by boat. However, the plan was changed, and the quarry was changed to Xianshan. Not only did the price per cubic foot increase to more than eleven yuan, but the road was too long and the car transport could not meet the emergency. All kinds of mistakes were enough to make the public suspicious. As for the dike repair workers, they were hired by each Lianbao, and the stipulated prices for earthwork were 7.9 cents, 6 cents, and 5.5 cents, depending on the distance of the earth extraction, and 1.2 cents for ramming work. With two workers working together to do one cubic foot, each person could earn at least 2.75 cents to a maximum of 3.95 cents of wages per day. However, the workers only received at most 1.5 cents, which was not enough for food, and the food was all self-provided. Currently, the project is urgent, and it is the busy farming season. Thousands of workers are not harvesting ripe wheat and are resentful. They live in Zhongshan Park, lying on the wet ground, with no grass or blankets, which is extremely miserable. The farmers all think that the government is conscripting labor, but they do not know that the government is paying for it. In addition, the people are most grieved about the additional tax. The county's field tax has not been sorted out. In the past, it was said to be 1.44 million mu. Large households often owed taxes and did not pay them, and small households were swallowed up by the household clerks. The government never collected four out of ten. The former Commissioner Cheng Zherun engaged in clearing up, increasing the number of mu on the one hand and increasing the tax amount on the other. Cheng was reported to be the best, but the people hated him to the bone. According to a villager, the farmland he cultivated paid five taels of silver before the 20th year of the Republic, which was equivalent to 11.5 yuan. During Liu Ji's tenure, three yuan was added to each tael, and five taels were added to 15 yuan, totaling 24.5 yuan. In the second time, eight yuan was added to each tael, and five taels were added to 40 yuan, totaling 55 yuan, which was already exhausting the pond to fish. During Cheng's tenure, it was doubled, and the so-called handling fee of two cents per mu had to be paid, which the people could not bear. The current field tax mu donation is about 3.6 cents for the best class, 3 cents for the next class, and 2.4 cents for the next class, which is not heavy compared to other counties. However, Cheng's additional tax was not measured, but based on the false report of the investigators, and the case was decided. There was one mu of farmland reported as two mu, (now the number of mu is more than 2.1 million), and the powerful families either reduced two mu to one mu. The burden is uneven and the handling is sloppy, and there is a way to take resentment.</p>
<p>From Xiangyang via Yijing to Shayang</p>
<p>After staying in Xiangyang for nearly ten days, I was planning to go to Yisha when the Han River suddenly rose. On the morning of the 26th, the water rose by one zhang in three hours, so Xiangfan was forbidden to cross. The people were afraid of the great calamity last year because the Old Dragon Dike project was not solid and had not been completed. Therefore, they were all frightened and ran to tell each other. I remembered that the Zhongxiang Yaodike was about to be completed, and it was necessary to go to check it out in person. So I left Xiangyang and took the road to Yicheng, Jingmen, and went to Zhongxiang. Traveling south from Xiangyang to Yicheng, the 90-li journey was full of wheat waves and rice seedlings, yellow and green interspersed, and it was gratifying to hope for a spring harvest. However, there were car water irrigators everywhere, and more and more to the south, because the county has more paddy fields than dry land, and it is impossible to plant rice without water. The counties in northern Hubei have more dry land than paddy fields, so at the same time, Xiangfan suffers from heavy rain, while Yicheng hopes for rain. The county is a third-class small county, and the Xiang River runs straight through the entire territory from northwest to southeast, so it is divided into Hedong and Hexi. Hedong is high and suffers from drought, while Hexi is low and suffers from flooding. In addition to the Han River, the waters of the He River often overflow and cause disasters. Last year's flood was especially serious, and the vitality has not yet recovered. Agricultural products are harvested in spring and autumn. Wheat is the main crop in spring, followed by broad beans and peas. Rice and cotton are the main crops in autumn. In a good year, 2 million shi of rice, 1 million shi of wheat, 1 million shi of miscellaneous grains, and 3 million jin of cotton can be produced. The procedures for Dongdian to pay Kedou include looking at the Kedou, setting the Kedou, dividing the Kedou, and participating in the Kedou. Participating in the Kedou means paying in advance. There are no rich people in the county, nor are there any poor people. Farmers can provide for themselves with rough clothes and food, but because disasters occur frequently, the rural economy is bankrupt and people's lives are becoming more and more difficult, which is not comparable to the past.</p>
<p>Further south, passing through Kongshi, Kuai City, Lexiangguan, and Nanqiao to Jingmen, the county has a vast area, bordering the Han River to the east and the Jzhang River to the west. The southern area is flat, while the northern area is mostly mountainous. Shao Ling's poem "Thousands of mountains and valleys rush to Jingmen", I wonder if it refers to this. Agricultural products are also mainly rice and wheat, followed by cotton, beans, sesame, sorghum, etc. In the past, banditry was too deep, followed by the continuous dispatch of funds by officials. The rural economy is also far worse than before. However, last year's flood was not serious, and the people's lives seem to be slightly better than those in Yicheng. South of the county seat, there are Yuanlinpu, Jianyangyi, Shilipu, and Zhuxiangzhen. Shilipu is especially a transportation hub. The Xiangsha and Hanyi roads both intersect here. Turning east from Shilipu, there are two major towns, Shihuibiao and Hougang, which are areas where rice and grain are collected. Hougang is on the shore of Chang Lake, and He bandits have ravaged it for the longest time. Last year, there were still scattered bandits, and this year there are troops from the 98th Division stationed there, and the strong team of the 4th District Office has also been armed, and it has begun to stabilize. But recently, a small part of the garrison suddenly mutinied, shot and injured six people, and all the giant merchants were looted. This incident happened only a week ago, and people still have lingering fears when they recount the situation. Arriving in Shayang, it is still under the jurisdiction of Jingmen. It is a famous commercial area with convenient water and land transportation. There are about a thousand shops, and the business is slightly worse than before. Hotels, restaurants, brothels, and opium dens are all available. Because it is far from the city and located in a key area, there was a proposal to set up another "Xiangzhong County," which was approved by Chairman Jiang, but it was shelved due to lack of government funds. However, it is still necessary to do so today. Shayang is 40 li from the Guankou section of the Yaodike of Zhongxiang, and 70 li from Shagang, and can be reached in one day. When I arrived in Shayang, I suddenly got shocking news that Yaodike had collapsed. The repair cost was 3 million yuan, more than 100,000 people worked, and it lasted for several months. Important personnel were stationed on the dike to supervise the work. Director He of the Suijing Office and Chairman Yang of the provincial government would come to inspect it soon. How could such a major project break down before it was completed? Coming from thousands of miles away, I heard this bad news and was both suspicious and fearful. I urgently asked for information from all parties and learned that at 8:30 PM on the 26th, the Han River suddenly rose by three meters. No Xiangyang alert was received beforehand, and there was negligence in prevention. The Xiongjiao Bridge section of the flood control dam in the 56th section of the fourth section, which was built of sand and had not yet been covered with soil, was washed away by the Han River. The Yaodike then collapsed. It was at night, and the workers were caught off guard. Some were swept into the flood and buried in the belly of fish. Other workers heard the news and rioted, and the order was almost disrupted. The water receded slightly on the 27th and gradually escaped danger. However, the flood rushed directly into Tianmen and Hanchuan, and a disaster has been reported. The Hanyi Road was washed away, and traffic was interrupted again. (Sent from Shayang on May 27)</p>

Since they ganged up and beat the customs officers stationed in Bengbu at the Tianjin-Pukou Railway freight station at the end of last month, they have become more arrogant and unreasonable. At 4:00 PM yesterday, two Korean ronin, Li Shanqung and Yunrui, arrived in Bengbu from Jinan on the Tianjin-Pukou express train. After getting off the train, the military police stationed at the station stepped forward to ask for their passports. The ronin claimed that they did not bring their passports with them, and the military police stepped forward to stop them from entering the street. The two did not listen to the persuasion and forcibly entered the market, and went all the way to the Communications Villa on Er Ma Road, where they joined Jin Lisheng (with a travel passport) and Cui Guanghao (without a passport), Korean ronin who had been staying in Bengbu for a long time. They ran around and paraded through the city. After learning that the Public Security Bureau had seized 490 bags of smuggled sugar in the stacks of the Gongji Bank a few days ago, they first went to the stacks to find the person in charge to reason with him, and then went to a certain merchant to find the sugar-buying traitors, but in the end they did not find any results. At about 5:00 PM, they entered the Public Security Bureau and demanded the return of the large batch of smuggled sugar seized a few days ago. They were menacing, unreasonable, and arrogant. An inspectorate staff member came forward to deal with them and refuted them with reason. Unexpectedly, Li and others became angry and roared loudly, and then waved their canes and beat people. The Public Security Bureau believed that the ronin were so rude and feared that an accident would happen, so they ordered the police to detain the three ronin without passports, Li Shanquing, Bu Yunrui, and Cui Guanghao, and sent them to the station. The security captain and five policemen were sent to escort the three Koreans to Beijing on the Tianjin-Pukou train this morning (16th) to be sent to the Japanese Embassy in Beijing for punishment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou The Wind of Competition for Transportation Has Subsided</h3>
<p>Several hundred laborers representing the boatmen and foremen of Twelve Fort Wharf came to Yangzhou to petition transportation merchants regarding the competition for transportation contracts. After a standoff lasting several days, they finally met and negotiated with transportation merchants from both Xiang and West banks yesterday. Both parties made concessions and reached a decision: (The Xiang bank will be allocated seventy-five votes, to be completed in eighty days; the West bank will be allocated twenty-five votes, with fifteen votes to be completed within one month and the remaining ten votes within the second month.) The representatives overseeing the work in Yangzhou can return to their respective wharves within days, and the competition for transportation has come to an end.</p>
<p>Nantong Son-in-Law Executed for Killing Father-in-Law</p>
<p>Sun Xifei, from Sian, had a grievance with his father-in-law, Zhai Changgui. At the Wu family dyeing workshop, they quarreled over gambling debts. Sun Xifei then conspired with Shan Wenhua to strangle Zhai Changgui to death in a grassy field. The district office arrested the murderers and handed them over to the court. On the sixteenth, the criminal court concluded the trial and sentenced Sun Xifei and Xu Wenhua to death for their joint murder.</p>
<p>Wang Qingmu Comes to Tongzhou to Petition</p>
<p>The Shengsi Islands, also known as the Ma'an Islands, have recently been a subject of intense dispute between the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang regarding their jurisdiction. Wang Qingmu, a respected elder of Chongming, representing various circles in Chongming County, came to Tongzhou to present to the special commissioner's office the reasons for opposing the jurisdictional change, requesting it be considered during the on-site inspection. Commissioner Ge is scheduled to go to Chongming on the twenty-first and has arranged to meet with Commissioner Zhao of Zhejiang Province on Shengshan Island on the twenty-third.</p>
<p>Shaoxing Steamboat Strike</p>
<p>The steamboats operating in the four suburban areas (east, south, west, and north) of Shaoxing went on strike because they opposed the Steamboat Workers' Union levying membership fees. After the establishment of the civilian steamboat workers union, the levy was approved and was split into two categories: Category A membership fee was one yuan per person, and Category B was fifty cents per person. The monthly fee was twenty cents per month for Category A and ten cents per month for Category B. On the fourteenth of this month, officials, including Lu Jinbao, were sent to collect membership fees from the member boatmen. On the fifteenth, some boatmen claimed they could not afford the fees and refused to pay, triggering the strike. By the sixteenth, the strike had expanded due to the failure to reach a satisfactory resolution. Steamboats in all townships and towns ceased operations, causing a complete standstill, disrupting transportation between the city and the countryside. Currently, party and government officials have dispatched personnel to persuade and mediate.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Farmers Begin Raising Summer Silkworms</p>
<p>The spring silkworm rearing in various counties of Zhejiang Province has progressed well, with a bountiful harvest of cocoons. Farmers are now continuing to raise summer silkworms, and 60,000 improved silkworm egg sheets have been ordered from Zhenjiang and Suzhou and distributed to counties such as Wuxing, Jiaxing, Deqing, Haining, and Chongde. The farmers are now beginning the work of stimulating the hatching of silkworms. The local summer silkworm industry has reported the successful hatching of silkworms, with a total rearing volume of over 100,000 egg sheets. It is expected that cocoon sales will begin in early next month.</p>
<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Branch Line Survey Completed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, under the Ministry of Railways' order, planned to construct a branch line. In April, Engineer Wang and several staff members departed from Hangzhou to survey the route from Nanchang, Zhangshu, to Ganzhou. The survey has now been completed after two months. Engineer Wang has returned to Nanchang and will report the survey results to the bureau in Hangzhou within days.</p>
<p>Pinghu Invention of Wireless Telephone</p>
<p>Zhu Xionglin, a local resident, runs a jewelry store. He is fond of research and has often stated his ambition to power ships with wireless electricity, which was met with laughter and disbelief. This year, Zhu built a small boat equipped with an electric motor and tested it in a small river, but the results were unsatisfactory. Recently, he built a larger boat and tested it on the Hangzhou Gongchen Bridge canal, which showed significant improvement. It is said that the Hangzhou Aviation Administration has approved the submission to the central government, which will assign experts to modify it for complete success.</p>
<p>Education Broadcasting Special Issue: An Overview of China's National Wealth and International Relations (1) Zhang Qiyun</p>
<p>Land and population are the foundation of a nation. According to a recent statistic by Mr. Wang Shida of the Academia Sinica, China’s population totals 430 million. The total area of the country is 4.3 million square miles, making the population density exactly 100 people per square mile, which is easy to remember. In square kilometers, the area is 11.1 million, with a population density of 38 people per square kilometer. China's area accounts for one-fourth of Asia and is larger than the entire continent of Europe. The world's land area is 52 million square miles, and China accounts for about 8 percent. The world's population is about 2 billion, so on average, one in every five people is Chinese. In terms of area, China ranks third in the world, only surpassed by the British Empire and Soviet Russia. Japan (including its colonies) has an area of about 6 percent of China's. In terms of population, China ranks first in the world, followed by the United States, Britain, Russia, and Japan. Japan (including its colonies) has a population of 90 million, about one-fifth of China's.</p>
<p>China's topography can be roughly divided into four categories: plains below 500 meters, hills between 500 and 1000 meters, plateaus between 1000 and 3000 meters, and mountains above 3000 meters. The distribution of topography is complex, but this simple standard can be used for a rough understanding of the terrain. Plains are most suitable for human life, followed by hills. The higher the terrain, the more difficult life becomes. Land below 1000 meters accounts for one-third of China's total land area, while land above 1000 meters accounts for two-thirds, indicating that the land suitable for living is not abundant. The ancients often spoke of favorable timing and geographical advantages, which today we call topography and climate. Both are important. Climate includes temperature and rainfall. Temperature refers to the changes of the four seasons. Roughly, there is no winter south of the Oujiang River in Zhejiang Province, meaning that the average temperature in each period (five days is one period) throughout the year never falls below 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). North of the Songhua River in the lower reaches, there is no summer, meaning that the average temperature in each period throughout the year never rises above 22 degrees Celsius (72 degrees Fahrenheit). The land between the Oujiang River in the south and the Songhua River in the north experiences significant changes in the four seasons. Rainfall is especially crucial for agriculture. If rainfall is below 500 mm (20 inches), agriculture becomes difficult except in artificially irrigated areas. If rainfall is below 250 mm (10 inches), the land becomes a barren desert. Unfortunately, land with rainfall below 500 mm accounts for two-thirds of China's area. Looking at the distribution of topography and climate in China, the Eighteen Provinces and most of the Three Eastern Provinces are plains and hills, with low terrain and abundant rainfall. The northwestern border provinces and regions are almost entirely plateaus and mountains, with high altitude and dryness. The favorable timing and geographical advantages are not as good as those in the southeast (including what is commonly referred to as the northeast). The Twenty-one Provinces of the Eighteen Provinces and the Three Eastern Provinces account for 43 percent of the country's area but 97 percent of its population. Conversely, the western and northern border provinces and regions account for 57 percent of the country's area but only 3 percent of its population. The influence of favorable timing and geographical advantages on human activities is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>In terms of area, China is the third largest country in the world. In terms of population, China is the largest country in the world. However, due to the limitations of topography and climate mentioned above, the actual wealth (human and material resources) is not as superior as one might imagine. China's cultivated land area totals 1.3 billion mu, which is less than 8 percent of the country's area. Japan, known as a mountainous island nation, has cultivated land that accounts for 15 percent of its total land area, about twice that of China. With a population of 430 million, each person has an average of only 3 mu of cultivated land. Farmers account for three-quarters of the total population, and each farmer can only have an average of 4 mu. In the Eighteen Provinces, each farmer has an average of only 3.5 mu. According to the standard set by Professor E.M. East of Harvard University, each person needs an average of 2.5 acres of land, which is about 15 mu. It can be seen that China's cultivated land is too little, resulting in high population density and small farming areas for farming households. Therefore, the annual income of farming households is very low, barely enough to meet basic needs, and the living standards are very low. The vast majority of people in China are universally poor, and the most difficult problem to solve in China is "farmers have too little land."</p>
<p>In addition to cultivated land, how much arable but uncultivated land is there? Mr. Chen Yaohang has summarized the opinions of various experts and estimated that there are about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion mu of arable but uncultivated land in China, accounting for about 10 percent of the country's area. On average, each person can have an additional 4 mu of land. In addition, China's forest land accounts for about 9 percent of the country's area, and barren mountains suitable for afforestation account for about 30 percent of the country's area. Forest land and land suitable for afforestation total 39 percent (statistics from the Ministry of Industry). Pastureland and grassland suitable for grazing account for about 20 percent of the country's area. The total of these three types of land (cultivated, forest, and pasture) accounts for about 77 percent of the country's area, more than three-quarters. The remaining quarter of the land is mostly located in the northwest border areas, the center of the Asian continent, which has the most plateaus and mountains in the world. They are either barren Gobi deserts or high and cold mountains, with little possibility of economic utilization.</p>
<p>The direction of China's modern national development is overseas Chinese and immigration to the Northeast, both natural trends in geography. According to statistics from 1934, the number of overseas Chinese in China is more than 7.8 million, of which 6.2 million are in Southeast Asia, accounting for about four-fifths of the total. In the same year, overseas Chinese remitted about 250 million yuan, and their contribution to the national economy is obvious. Most of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia come from Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and most of the immigrants to the Northeast come from Shandong and Hebei provinces. From 1923 to 1930, the total number of immigrants to the Three Eastern Provinces was more than 5 million. From 1927 to 1930, about 1.5 million people settled in the Three Eastern Provinces. The geographical environment of the Northeast is similar to that of the provinces within the customs, but the land is vast and the population is sparse, with each farmer having an average of 11 mu of land, making it the most promising immigration area. The land of the Four Northeastern Provinces accounts for 11.5 percent of the country's area, its population accounts for 7.5 percent of the country's total, and its abundant natural resources are of great importance in East Asia. The League of Nations Commission of Inquiry report stated that the relocation of millions of Chinese farmers has determined that the Northeast will forever be owned by China. Whether in law or in fact, any attempt to separate the Northeast from China will create a serious "territorial recovery" problem in the future. This is indeed not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Farmers account for 75 percent of China's total population, which is a huge number. Comparing with major powers, the figure is 7 percent for Britain, 26 percent for the United States, 31 percent for Germany, and 42 percent for France. Even in neighboring Japan, farmers account for only 48 percent. Agricultural products are broadly divided into food crops and cash crops. China's food crops mainly include rice, wheat, sorghum, millet, and corn. Cotton is the most important cash crop, and soybeans fall between the two. According to statistics from the former Legislative Yuan and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, wheat accounts for 21 percent of the total crop area, rice accounts for 17 percent, sorghum and millet each account for 9 percent, corn accounts for 6 percent, soybeans account for 10 percent, and cotton accounts for 5 percent, totaling 77 percent. The statistics for various food production (average for 1932-1934) are 1.02 billion dan (market dan) for rice, 520 million dan for wheat, 270 million dan for sorghum, 250 million dan for millet, and 170 million dan for corn. The food distribution of the Chinese people is almost the opposite of that of Westerners. The main food of the Chinese is rice and noodles, with fish, meat, and vegetables used as side dishes. The main food of Westerners is eggs, milk, and meat, while rice and noodles are side dishes. In the Yangtze River basin and south, the staple food of the people is rice. The staple food in the Yellow River basin is more complex, with wheat being the most important, followed by millet, sorghum, corn, and oats. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Using soybeans to replace meat was invented by the Chinese. Westerners call us vegetarians, but the soybean has contributed greatly to the health of this vegetarian nation." Recently, Europeans have also used soybeans to replace milk. Soybeans in the Three Eastern Provinces have become a world commodity, with an annual output of about 100 million dan, accounting for 37 percent of the national total. The three provinces also produce 37 percent of the national sorghum output, 21 percent of the national wheat output, and 7 percent of the national millet output. The position of the Northeast in China's agriculture can be seen.</p>

<p>Local News: Customs Spokesman Discusses</p>
<p>North China Smuggling Is Unrelated to China's Import Tariff Rates</p>
<p>Smuggled Goods Have Lower Tariff Rates Than Japanese Taxes; Customs Officers Are Subject to Interference and Cannot Perform Their Duties</p>
<p>A spokesman for the customs authorities made a statement to a reporter from the Central News Agency, saying that Japanese authorities and merchants often attribute the cause of smuggling in North China to China's excessively high tax rates and the failure of customs anti-smuggling personnel to fully perform their duties. In reality, these are just pretexts. The severity of smuggling in North China is entirely due to the interference with customs officers, preventing them from exercising their powers, which has nothing to do with the level of tax rates. If, as the Japanese claim, smuggling is caused by excessively high import tariffs, why is it not severe in other coastal areas of China, but rampant only in eastern Hebei? Even if the tax rates are too high, they should be resolved through negotiations. Why condone the unlawful acts of unscrupulous individuals? It is also inaccurate to say that customs anti-smuggling personnel are not effective. Customs officers are often interfered with by Japanese soldiers in every action they take. How can they be expected to be effective? The London Times published an editorial on May 18 criticizing this matter, saying that this is not just a local act by Japanese soldiers, but a deliberate policy of the government. This statement hits the nail on the head. To prove that China's tax rates are not excessively high, here is an example. Take white sugar as an example. China's import tax on white sugar is a maximum of 9.60 gold units per 100 kilograms. Germany's is 32 marks, equivalent to 19.00 gold units. Britain's is about 13.20 gold units. France's is about 33.30 gold units. Japan's import tax is 14.90 Japanese yen per 100 kilograms, equivalent to about 10.71 gold units. This is still referring to the current depreciated Japanese yen. If calculated according to the previous rate of 0.8025 Japanese yen per gold unit, the tax would be as high as 30.93 gold units per 100 kilograms. The import tax on white sugar in various countries is higher than in China. This can be seen from this example. Take rayon as an example. China's is 120.00 gold units per 100 kilograms. Germany's is about 131.00 gold units. Britain's is about 101.60 gold units, plus an ad valorem tax of 25 percent. The United States is about 147.00 gold units. France is about 159.16 gold units. Japan's, calculated at the current exchange rate, is about 72.82 gold units. However, if calculated according to the Japanese yen before devaluation, it would be 210.00 gold units, which is also higher than China's. A comparison of the import tariff rates of China and Japan for various smuggled goods is listed below. Furthermore, China has the absolute right to set tariff rules without violating the most-favored-nation clause, while Japanese merchants should abide by the treaty provisions and comply with China's customs regulations. Some Japanese newspapers have also said that the exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the gold unit is too high, but this is the result of the depreciation of the Japanese currency and has nothing to do with the tax rate itself.</p>
<p>British Officials and Civilians in Shanghai Prepare to Celebrate the New Emperor's Birthday</p>
<p>A Military Parade Will Be Held on the Morning of the 23rd; Reception of Foreign Guests Will Be Suspended in Remembrance of the Late Emperor</p>
<p>The 23rd of this month is the birthday of the new British Emperor Edward VIII. British officials and civilians in Shanghai are preparing for the first celebration since the new emperor's accession to the throne. At 7:55 a.m. on that day, a military parade will be held at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road, with the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Regiment of the British Army in Shanghai, commanded by Major Massey, performing the drill. The British Consul-General in Shanghai, Bailey Nan, will represent the new emperor to receive the salute and invite diplomatic personnel from various countries, the local government of Shanghai, and the concession authorities to participate. However, in remembrance of the late Emperor George V, the traditional tea party at the Consulate-General for Chinese and foreign officials will be suspended.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Provide Details of Eurasian Air Travel</p>
<p>Shortening the Duration of the Trip to Test Aviation Efficiency</p>
<p>The China Press reports that Mr. Semlink, an employee of the Java Mail Steamship Company in Shanghai, recently traveled from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Hong Kong by air, and then from Hong Kong to Shanghai. This journey shows that traveling from Amsterdam or London to Shanghai can be done in less than eight days. Mr. Semlink departed from Amsterdam on a KLM plane early on June 3, flew to Penang around 1 p.m. on the 7th, changed to an Imperial Airways plane to Hong Kong the next morning, and arrived there around midnight on the 9th. He then took a boat to Shanghai and arrived on the 11th. The KLM plane can carry six passengers, plus mail and luggage, and is very comfortable. From Amsterdam to Bandung in Batavia, the plane mostly flies at an altitude of 10,000 feet, so passengers can sleep soundly on the plane, even though the climate is very hot when they arrive in Batavia. However, it is difficult to sleep when the plane lands for the night. Excellent food and lodging are provided along the way. Except for occasional night flights, passengers usually stay on land at night. The plane has two pilots, an engineer, and a radio operator. The route currently operates two flights per week. Passengers traveling by boat from Marseilles to Shanghai take about a month. If they take the air route, they can arrive in just over a week. A through ticket for air travel from London or Amsterdam to Hong Kong costs 170 pounds. The Imperial Airways plane can carry two passengers in addition to the two pilots. Its main focus is on transporting mail. This time, Mr. Semlink was the only passenger on the plane from Penang to Hong Kong. After arriving in Hong Kong, the mail was transported to Guangzhou by train, and then by plane to Shanghai. Imperial Airways now operates one flight per week on this route. There is a possibility of increasing the number of flights in the near future. The average speed of the planes is 122 miles per hour. The Far East route does not currently operate night flights, but this will eventually be realized in the future. At that time, the eight-day journey can be shortened to just over four days. Then, those in the Far East will no longer be unhappy about being far away from home, as the distance will be like taking a boat to North China.</p>

The issuance of bonds was handled by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the HSBC. Registration began on the 16th. The banking community in Shanghai and Chinese and foreign citizens enthusiastically went to the banks acting as agents to apply for registration. As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the registration amount had been fully subscribed, so registration was closed.</p>
<p>The China Flying Society Training Class Holds Opening Ceremony Today</p>
<p>The China Flying Society began preparations in March 1934 to study aviation and promote civilian flying. It was formally established on October 1, 1935, and began operating at No. 146, Luban Road. It purchased four aircraft for training purposes and recruited members, totaling more than 400 members of various types. It recruited more than 40 students, stipulated courses, and prepared Longhua Airport as a training ground. The opening ceremony of the training class will be held at 10:00 a.m. today. Yesterday, Nie Kaiyi, Li Dachao, Chen Lezhou, and others from the China Aviation Association came to inspect the arrangements and invited various agencies, organizations, and leaders from all walks of life to participate in the grand ceremony. Mayor Wu will personally preside over the meeting and dispatch Zhang Yuliang, Song Zheng, Li Jimin, and Zhu Shengyang to serve as receptionists.</p>
<p>Customs Builds Five New Smuggling Interception Vessels</p>
<p>The China News Agency reports that the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Section has ordered the construction of five small smuggling interception vessels. These vessels are being built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. Each vessel is about 32 feet long, 7 feet wide, and has a draft of 4-5 inches. They have 504 horsepower and can travel 40 nautical miles per hour. They are also equipped with wireless communication devices. They will be completed within this month, which should greatly enhance the anti-smuggling capabilities.</p>
<p>Receiving and Purchasing Smuggled Goods Subject to Criminal Penalties for Dealing in Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Issues Instructions to Both Railways</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received instructions from the Ministry of Railways, stating that the Finance Department has reported that in cases of tax evasion, penalties are usually imposed by the Customs in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. Recently, smuggling has become increasingly rampant, and strict punishment is needed to maintain tax revenue and ensure public welfare. The Ministry has drafted eight articles of punitive regulations, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved by the National Government for promulgation and implementation. Since tax evasion is a criminal act, smuggled goods are stolen goods. Criminal law has clear provisions for receiving and purchasing stolen goods, so receiving and purchasing smuggled goods should be subject to criminal penalties for dealing in stolen goods. However, this is a new initiative, and the general public may not be aware of it, and judicial organs at all levels may have questions. Therefore, the Executive Yuan is requested to issue a clear order that anyone who receives or purchases smuggled goods shall, in addition to having the goods confiscated and forfeited to the government in accordance with the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, be subject to criminal penalties for dealing in stolen goods in accordance with the criminal law, so that the general public will be warned, and the Judicial Yuan should be instructed to notify all levels of judicial organs to comply. The provisional regulations for punishing tax evasion have been approved by the National Government and have been transferred to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Finance Department has been instructed to promulgate and implement them. The relevant provisions of Article 349 of the Criminal Code are attached and should be followed. The relevant article of Article 349 of the Criminal Code is attached and should be followed by the general public. The relevant article of Article 349 of the Criminal Code is attached and should be followed by the general public. The relevant article of Article 349 of the Criminal Code is attached. The Chamber of Commerce Convenes Various Industries to Discuss Refusal to Sell Smuggled Goods Yesterday</p>
<p>Submitting a Proposal to the General Assembly to Form an Anti-Smuggling Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of relevant industry associations at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss effective measures to refuse to sell smuggled goods. Representatives from 16 industry associations, including knitting, seafood and groceries, cosmetics, Chinese and foreign groceries, North-South goods exchange, chemical raw materials, ginseng and bird's nest, hardware, Western paint, salted fish, cotton cloth, sugar, silk, paper, candy and biscuits, and electric wire and silk factories, were present. The meeting was chaired by Luo Qinghua, director of the Business Committee. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the representatives reported on the situation of smuggled goods in their respective industries. After a lengthy discussion, it was decided that the case should be jointly submitted by the industry representatives present to the current members' general assembly to appoint representatives from various industries to form an anti-smuggling committee. Zheng Hairuo, Ge Wei'an, Xi Rungeng, Jin Chuxiang, Ye Xiaoshan, Zheng Zenan, Jin Runxiang, Gao Shouheng, Luo Qinghua, and others were appointed to draft a plan and submit it to the general assembly for discussion.</p>

<p>Supplement: Measures for Confiscating Smuggled Goods</p>
<p>Suggestions from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association submitted a proposal to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday to reform the public auction of smuggled goods confiscated by customs and to have them purchased by the relevant industry associations. The "reason" is that smuggling from North China is becoming increasingly serious, and inferior goods evading taxes in various parts of South China are increasingly flooding the market. The central government has made every effort to rectify customs revenue and maintain the safety of the commercial marketplace, and has clearly stipulated anti-smuggling measures and conducted strict investigations, which are unavoidable. However, since the strict implementation of anti-smuggling measures, the unrest in the market has not been resolved. The reason is that the customs' public auction of confiscated goods lacks fixed standards and is left to those who specialize in buying and selling auction items, manipulating the market. The customs fail to directly sell certain types of goods to merchants specializing in those types of goods. Without standard prices, the goods are naturally auctioned off at low prices and sold at low prices, and the market is still full of cheap goods. Therefore, the original equal goods in the market are frequently squeezed out due to cost, and the stable order of the commercial marketplace is completely destroyed, which is contrary to the central government's original intention of protecting the interests of merchants. Therefore, reforming the auction method is an urgent and immediate relief. "Measures" are to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to order the Customs to have smuggled and confiscated goods purchased by the relevant industry associations at fair prices in the future. For example, sugar should be purchased by the Sugar Industry Association, and silk should be purchased by the Silk Industry Association. The relevant industry associations should then notify their members to purchase in proportion at market prices. All proceeds from the sale should be used as the regular expenses of the industry associations to assist in anti-smuggling. If this is done, the Customs will not only be spared the trouble of auctioning, but also prevent those who make a living from auctioning from suppressing prices and manipulating the market. The market will not be affected by smuggled goods, resulting in disturbances and unrest, and the remaining money can be used to assist the customs authorities in enriching their anti-smuggling capacity. However, in order to quickly resolve and eliminate the serious problem of smuggling, all smuggled goods confiscated by the customs should be completely destroyed in accordance with the measures for confiscating narcotic drugs. Strict investigation of smuggled goods is different from tax evasion. Smuggling is an illegal disturbance to our market, while tax evasion is a pursuit of development abroad. These smuggled goods that are harmful to our national industry and commerce must be dealt with resolutely. There is no way to cut off the roots and stabilize the market. Is this feasible? Please decide.</p>
<p>Yongli Company Issues Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>A Syndicate of Five Banks Underwrites 5.5 Million</p>
<p>Yongli Chemical Industry Company specializes in manufacturing chemical products such as caustic soda and soda ash. It is a large-scale company with a head office in Tianjin and branch offices and sales offices in Shanghai on Moore Road and Maibaige Road. The company has found that the demand for sulfuric acid is high in the country, so it is building a large-scale ammonium sulfate plant in Nanjing. It is issuing 5.5 million yuan in corporate bonds to finance the project. It was learned yesterday that the construction of the ammonium sulfate plant in Nanjing requires a large amount of funds, so the company is issuing 5.5 million yuan in corporate bonds. It has reached an agreement with the banking community to have a "Yongli Company Loan Syndicate" composed of five banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Shanghai, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Jincheng Bank, and the Zhongnan Bank, to fully underwrite the bonds. The Bank of China will underwrite 1.5 million, the Bank of Shanghai will underwrite 1.5 million, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank will underwrite 1 million, and the Jincheng Bank and the Zhongnan Bank will jointly underwrite 1.5 million, totaling 5.5 million yuan. The interest rate is set at 7 percent, the term is 9 years, interest will be paid for the first three years, and principal and interest will be repaid in installments from the fourth year until the entire amount is paid off in the ninth year. The company's entire assets, worth over 20 million, will be used as collateral. The contract has been signed, and the syndicate has paid the full amount of the loan. The construction of the ammonium sulfate plant in Beijing is nearing completion, and it is scheduled to open in mid-August. It is planned to invite members of the financial community to visit this week.</p>
<p>The China Press Records Rose's Visit to Japan</p>
<p>Recounting the Reasons for Rejecting Rose's Proposals</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Press recently published an article detailing Rose's visit to Japan and the reasons for the Japanese side's rejection of Rose's proposals. Here is a summary translation. Sir Arthur Rose, the head of the British Economic Mission, has conducted in-depth research on the financial and economic situation in the Far East (especially China) over the past nine months. As he is about to return home, he paid a visit to Japan last week. Rose arrived in Tokyo on June 8 and immediately met with Isoguya Renkichi, the director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Army (former military attache at the Japanese Embassy in China), for two hours. Rose expressed his opinion that since the Nanjing government is the most sound and powerful political organization in China, assisting the Nanjing government in economic recovery and political construction would stabilize the situation in China and realize peace and security in the Far East. Rose also said that he did not understand Japan's opposition to the Nanjing government's financial reforms. Isoguya said that Japan is indeed willing to assist China's economic recovery, but due to past setbacks, it must now step back. Isoguya also said that Japan's relationship with China is extremely close. Unless China's political problems are resolved, it is difficult to discuss economic support. The next day, Rose went to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. The British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, and the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs also participated. At that time, the British representatives requested that Anglo-Japanese cooperation with China be based on economic interests, while the Japanese officials focused on political issues with China. Arita then said that on the occasion of Sir Arthur Rose's return to England, the consultations between the two sides were sufficient to enhance Anglo-Japanese mutual understanding. Thus, Rose was quite disappointed that his mission to China was misunderstood by the Japanese, who said, "My activities in China are not only for the benefit of Britain, but also because I believe that promoting China's economic recovery and increasing the purchasing power of the Chinese people will benefit all countries, including the United States and Japan, that have economic relations with China."</p>
<p>Rose believes that the Chinese government can maintain its existing financial system without the assistance of external forces in the future. However, Arita did not trust the future of China's currency management and said that since this matter is closely related to political stability, it still requires careful study. Rose mentioned the issue of China's central bank. Arita said that although he approved of the establishment of such an institution, financial assistance could only be discussed after China's political relations with both the outside world and Japan (in particular) had become stable. He also said that if the Nanjing government was willing to change its past attitude and cooperate politically with Japan, Japan would provide all kinds of assistance.</p>
<p>That evening, Rose attended a dinner at the Japan Economic Federation, where he spoke with managers from Mitsubishi Corporation and others. Japanese economic leaders said that while Britain's policy toward China could focus entirely on economic issues, the Japanese placed great importance on China's political stability.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Rose has been deeply resented by the Japanese since his arrival in China last autumn. At that time, Japanese newspapers all said that if Britain wanted to help China's currency system construction, it should first consult with Japan. "Tokyo National" also said that if Britain wants to obtain Japan's cooperation, it must first recognize Japan's special position. Japan is the only power in the Far East. If the British do not get its understanding and cooperation, they will not be able to do anything in the Far East. At the same time, the "Shanghai Daily" published an editorial stating that Rose's visit to China was only to save</p>

<p>The Sausage Casing Industry in Shanghai (Continued); Edited by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(Twenty-eighth in the series "An Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce")</p>
<p>Market Prices: Sausage casing prices fluctuate according to supply and demand. Lamb casings are the most expensive, while beef casings are the cheapest. Recently, pork prices have risen, so pork casings have also risen accordingly. According to industry insiders, casing prices are likely to stabilize in the future. The values of various types are described below:</p>
<p>Fresh Goods: Divided into three grades. Top-quality goods produced in this city are called Grade A, inferior goods produced in this city or those that have been watered are called Grade B, and fresh pork from old sows and returned rural pigs, white-haired pigs produced in this city are called Grade C. Prices range from 36 cents to 32 cents per set, roughly. Generally, the Nanshi area is dominated by the Suzhou-Wuxi group, with higher pork prices, while the Hongkou area is dominated by the Ningbo group, with lower pork prices.</p>
<p>Cleaned Goods: Sold by the "ba" (bundle), with a length of 135 yards. Currently, each "ba" sells for around two yuan.</p>
<p>Processed Goods: Measured in hundreds of pieces, with each piece being 13.5 yards long. Roughly, it costs six to seven cents to process a set of fresh casings into processed goods, plus taxes and miscellaneous fees. Since mid-May, transactions for processed goods have been conducted with delivery at the warehouse, and all inspections and tariffs are handled by the exporter. The market prices for the 10th of this month are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Business Conditions: Sausage casing trading is mainly based on futures, with forward transactions lasting up to three months. Spot transactions are rare. Export business relies on export firms as intermediaries for sales, and manufacturers undertake processing orders. In the past, 20% of the silver was obtained from the firms in advance, or the firms advanced the money to be used as capital for manufacturing orders. Therefore, sausage casing manufacturers' commissions to firms exceeded the norm, even more than those for fur exports. Currently, there are more sausage casing factories, and business competition is becoming more intense. Furthermore, the creditworthiness of sausage casing factories is not well-established, so firms are unwilling to advance money. At the same time, manufacturers also feel that the market is sluggish and business is difficult, and they often lose money after taking orders. Therefore, since May 16th of this year, all commissions have been calculated as ordinary export goods (one yuan per hundred yuan). This method of mutual resistance has resulted in significant losses for export firms, and its impact on the future of sausage casing factories' business is even more profound. It is rumored that there are still accommodating measures for those sausage casing manufacturers who have long-standing relationships with firms.</p>
<p>Sausage casing exports are seasonal. The peak season for pork casings is from September to February of the following year. Lamb casings are traded in large quantities in Tianjin, while Shanghai's business is very sporadic. Sometimes sausage casing factories ship goods for export without going through the export firms for inspection, but if there are any shortages in quantity or uneven sizes, the firms are responsible. Manufacturers with limited capital often experience the above situation, and it is not uncommon for them to be unable to deliver goods on time, resulting in losses and bankruptcies. Therefore, firms are now setting up their own factories to manufacture, making it difficult for sausage casing factories' business to develop.</p>
<p>Fresh casings are obtained from meat shops on this street. Beforehand, competitors agree with each other not to compete for business. The payments are settled twice a month. At the same time, when reselling to sausage casing factories, there are also mutual agreements not to be chaotic. In addition, there are generally regulations for sausage casing factories to ship goods to export firms, excerpts of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Deliverer: Zhonghua Sausage Casing Factory; Recipient: Mei Tai Foreign Firm</p>
<p>Deliverer: Gong Ji Sausage Casing Factory; Recipient: An Li Foreign Firm</p>
<p>Deliverer: Bai Jian Sausage Casing Factory; Recipient: De Chang Foreign Firm</p>
<p>Deliverer: Sheng Ji Sausage Casing Factory; Recipient: Fu Lai De Foreign Firm</p>

<p>Nanjing Higher Normal School Alumni Congress Postponed; The General Association of Alumni from the National Nanjing Higher Normal School, Dongnan University, and National Central University originally scheduled the second member representative congress of various local branches for July 4th and 5th in Nanjing. The newspaper notes that, as of June 10th, only a few branches under the association's jurisdiction, both domestic and overseas, had convened meetings, elected representatives, and submitted updated member rosters for record-keeping by June 10th, as required by the association's charter. This fell far short of the statutory number of units. With the congress date approaching, it was difficult to hold the congress as scheduled. After a resolution by the association's standing council, it was decided to postpone the congress temporarily. The date of the postponed congress will be announced after a decision is made at the next meeting of the entire council. The currently elected representatives of the branches remain valid, and those who have not yet elected representatives are urged to expedite the process so that representatives can be appointed in time to attend the congress in Nanjing. It is reported that the association has over fifty established branches both domestic and overseas, including Nanjing, Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Tokyo, and London. In recent years, the number of students studying in Germany, Italy, and other countries has increased, and it is planned to organize students and establish branches in Berlin and Rome to facilitate communication and mutual support among students and to actively develop the association's affairs as a whole.</p>

<p>1936 Budget for Education Fees in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province; Totaling Over 9.81 Million; An Increase of Over 500,000 Compared to Last Year; Since the implementation of compulsory education in Jiangsu Province, exceptional attention has been paid to educational funding. When reviewing the budgets of various counties for 1936, efforts were made to increase educational and cultural expenses in various counties. Now that the budget review for various counties has been completed, the statistics of educational and cultural expenses are as follows. It is generally expected that there will be no changes when submitted to the provincial government meeting. All counties have increased, except for Wujiang, which has decreased by 14,911 yuan.</p>

<p>an old woman, "Although she's a bit old, she can do everything. When grandma gave birth to Ah Guan, she even made his little clothes..." Before she finished speaking, she pointed at me and my wife, wanting that old woman to call us young master and mistress. I looked at the newly arrived maid; her clothes were still clean and tidy. My wife was going to give birth after the New Year, and old people are always slow. My wife helped to gloss over it, saying we'd have her call us after the New Year. My wife agreed, the elder told her what she should do, and she stayed.</p>
<p>Our little family of two could manage some simple things on our own, so we usually didn't hire servants. But during the New Year, because relatives and friends come and go, we always hire a temporary worker to help. The proprietress of that head shop also often came to our house. Originally, it was easy to hire someone at the end of the year, as it was like doing business, the end of the year being the best time for income, with gifts and red envelopes; every servant almost relied on earning a little more money during the New Year. Now, because my wife was pregnant, we especially hired a temporary worker a bit early. The countryside had just finished with the farm work and hadn't come to Shanghai yet, so that proprietress sold her services and charged us an extra four dimes for transportation.</p>
<p>The newly arrived servant was very diligent, and she seemed to know a lot; she was an experienced helper. But old people's tempers are too stubborn. If she hasn't finished one thing, she refuses to take on a second, and her movements are slow. If there's something urgent waiting for her to do, you can't help but get angry. My wife is impatient, and she arranges things days in advance. Usually, when there's no servant, she manages everything well on her own. Now that she's pregnant, she can't handle anything too heavy, and that old nanny especially makes people impatient.</p>
<p>"No one wants her in Huangdang Lane. I knew she was a useless thing—looking at her makes your stomach burst with anger!" When something didn't go her way, my wife nagged.</p>
<p>I always advised her to be patient. Since she couldn't move around herself and there was nowhere else to get someone, we should talk about it after the New Year.</p>
<p>And so, that old nanny carelessly got through the New Year. But after the New Year, it was even worse. She became lazy, and when my wife scolded her, she expressed unhappiness about working. I remember before the Mid-Autumn Festival, she secretly slipped away.</p>
<p>During this time, we hired another new servant, but she didn't stay long either.</p>
<p>Now that my wife has given birth, her mother's family recommended a servant to take care of the postpartum woman, but I don't have the time to take care of things myself. So we went to ask that high-nosed proprietress again.</p>
<p>When she sent someone over, it was surprisingly the old nanny who had run away. When she saw us, she just lowered her head and fiddled with the corner of her clothes, looking very embarrassed. The proprietress, however, was beating her broken gong again, congratulating us for a while:</p>
<p>"Mistress, I really didn't know anything. She (the old nanny) just came to my shop saying she had run away from your place. I immediately scolded her. Young master and mistress treat servants very well. If you want to leave, you should say so. Everyone secretly slips away; how can my recommendation shop stay open? Luckily, young master and mistress are generous and still come to my shop for someone. When she heard that, she remembered how good you were. Please, young master and mistress, do a good deed and let her work for a while longer."</p>
<p>My wife just closed her eyes and shook her head in bed. I was also afraid that the old nanny would suddenly get angry and upset my wife, so I refused the high-nosed woman's request and asked her to find someone else.</p>
<p>The proprietress said many nice things, and finally led the old nanny away. My wife gave them both two dimes and some red eggs. The old nanny, with red eyes, said something to my wife, but we couldn't hear it clearly. Watching her back, my wife said, "Looking at her now, she's too pitiful!"</p>
<p>Landlord Wang Ci</p>
<p>My landlord is a Fujianese man who works as a technician on a warship. I believe he is a fairly capable person. The first day I moved into that garret, I chatted with him for a few words:</p>
<p>"Shouldn't there be bedbugs here?"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course."</p>
<p>"When summer comes, should there be some cool breeze here?"</p>
<p>"Of course, of course."</p>
<p>And so, I moved in. The next day, I discovered the landlord's lies. The bedbugs were truly like a group of starving beasts, and the next morning my body was covered with many red rashes. From then on, the landlord's kind impression in my mind began to waver. I thought that even if I could endure the pain of being bitten fiercely by bedbugs, I shouldn't associate with such a deceitful person. So, from the next day, I was determined to move.</p>
<p>However, the days passed by imperceptibly, and the pressure of life seemed to not allow me the leisure to fuss about the issue of residence. The idea of moving gradually disappeared from my memory.</p>
<p>A young couple lived in the front building. Ten days later, I became quite friendly with them. The woman would often ask me:</p>
<p>"Are you getting used to living here? We're thinking of moving at any time." After speaking, a bitter smile always lingered on her face, as if saying:</p>
<p>"Poor child! You've been deceived just like us."</p>
<p>After that, my nerves fell into a state of terror. I suspected that the landlord would give me even greater deception, or an even more severe kind of coercion. So, I wanted to move even more, move.</p>
<p>I moved in on May 3rd. On June 20th, the young couple in the front building really moved out. On the 21st, a brand new red paper saying "Front Building for Rent" was pasted on our door.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, after the young couple moved out, the landlord would come into my room every night and chat with me about this and that. Because I already harbored suspicions about him, I felt that his words were all the more hypocritical and fake.</p>
<p>He asked if I had any friends who wanted to rent a house. If I introduced them, they could get a special discount on the price. He told me that his monthly income was only thirty-five yuan, and he had leased this house from the head landlord for thirty yuan. If he left the front building empty, he really couldn't make a living.</p>
<p>Once, a friend came to see me and mistakenly went to the front building. The landlord heard the sound of footsteps in the front building and rushed up, thinking my friend was there to see the house. When my friend explained his intention, he dejectedly tiptoed back down.</p>
<p>But I still wanted to move. At the same time, I was also worried about the landlord's livelihood.</p>
<p>Logically, I should have given notice to vacate the house ten days in advance, but a inexplicable feeling arose in my heart. I thought:</p>
<p>"If I tell him, how panicked and disappointed would he be!"</p>
<p>So, I endured it day by day. On the evening before the full month's expiration, when he came to my room to chat as usual, I could no longer endure it:</p>
<p>"I'm preparing to leave tomorrow."</p>
<p>The sudden blow stunned him for a long time. Finally, he ran over and, with an attitude of surpassing all love, suddenly grasped my hand tightly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, wouldn't it be good to stay for another month?"</p>
<p>"My mother sent a letter telling me I don't need to wander outside anymore. Friend, don't be upset! No one can make a living this year."</p>
<p>The landlord's eyes seemed to be moist. I seemed to regret it a bit.</p>
<p>The next day, when I hurriedly moved, the landlord's eldest son came over and said softly and hesitantly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, dad said that according to the rules, the house should have been vacated ten days in advance. You said it late, so dad wants you to compensate a little for the loss..." "How much?" "Two yuan!"</p>
<p>I took out two banknotes, stuffed them into the child's hand, and patted his head: "Child, comfort your dad—although this money can't save that empty house."</p>

<p>Smuggling</p>
<p>Due to the protection of certain foreigners, "smuggling" is spreading throughout the country, causing a huge loss of tax revenue. However, most traitors and vagrants, under the protection of certain foreigners, are vigorously engaged in smuggling, and this kind of "taking advantage of the situation" trick is openly and deeply rooted in the folk of North China.</p>
<p>In a small village in the north, for several days, large mule carts carrying smuggled goods have been passing through there every day, escorted by foreigners disguised as Russians.</p>
<p>In this village, the business of making meat pies has been passed down for generations, but now, only Li Yuhua's family remains.</p>
<p>When the night was not yet deep, there were already few pedestrians on the street. Li Yuhua hurried back from outside.</p>
<p>"It's broken, it's broken," he hummed, bolting the door.</p>
<p>His wife stopped working in surprise and asked him, "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Those big mule carts carrying smuggled goods are passing through here again. Some days ago, when they passed through here, some people were pulled away to pull the carts. Li Yuhua was deeply afraid that he would encounter such a thing, so he hurriedly bolted the door and wanted to escape being pulled away. His wife also fully believed that this time might be a little different from the last time! Could it be that in the dark night, with women and children in every family, they would really come?"</p>
<p>However, not long after, the sound of knocking on the door gave them proof that this group of people did break into their house that night.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Yuhua anxiously told his wife to get up quickly, but his wife carelessly opened the door for them.</p>
<p>After this group entered Li's house, they shamelessly teased and extorted Li's wife in every way. "I want to eat this, I want to eat that."</p>
<p>They threatened Li's wife with guns. Li's wife had no way to struggle and was forced to do this and that for them.</p>
<p>Because there wasn't enough white sugar to make tea, Mai Yunxiang ordered his companion to steal smuggled sugar. It happened to be noticed by the boss. The boss also chased after him. Then, Li's wife saw him smashing her beloved vase in front of her. She picked up the gun on the table numbly and shot the boss dead.</p>
<p>In this instant, the villagers arrived at the scene with Li Yuhua. In an atmosphere of tension, they united and forbade the smuggling to pass through the village again.</p>

<p>Ah, I have been away from my hometown for you for a long time. Today, Xiang is here, and Nongyu should follow the historiographer. The humanoid had no choice but to agree. Wanting to say goodbye to the wise mother in front of the hall. Only afraid that it will be easy to rise in status but difficult to leave. Waving his brush, he wrote a poem on the wall. One is a flower basket that expresses one's heart. Bowing in thanks to the sky, she hurriedly left. Leaving the room, she went out through the back garden door. Only worrying, that the night dew would be slippery. Happily, the moonlight was better than carrying a lamp. Calling for a good small boat, but it was not there. Qiu Gu's golden lotus feet were too narrow to walk. Only seeing, a small stream pavilion. Resting in the pavilion for a moment. Looking across the river. A boat stopped. Calling the boatman to hurry on the journey immediately. In the boat, each poured out their heart. Suddenly hearing the boatman singing. Remembering the cause and effect from afar. Waiting to hear the boat dock on Guantang Road. In an instant, the sky was bright. Prime Minister Long Ting withdrew. Not seeing the servant come to thank him. Ordering people to search the beautiful garden. Seeing the door locked in private escape. A poem in the corner and words on the platform. Examining the parallel poem by Tang Yan. The Prime Minister was furious at this moment. The Madam's old tears flowed down. Saying, "Return my maid Qiu Xiang!" Driving the boat, chasing after them without stopping. The pearl of Hepu was returned to its proper place.</p>

<p>Movie Haiyan Theater Troupe Seeks Members</p>
<p>In the current critical moment of fighting for survival, a most popular and active theatrical work that can organize the broad masses of the people's anti-Japanese and anti-traitor sentiments and actions is needed to be established and grow. Therefore, the Haiyan Theater Troupe is adapting to this environment and, in the united front of fighting for national freedom and liberation and anti-Japanese and anti-traitor, is taking on the important task assigned to it in extraordinary times with collective strength to actively establish the national defense drama movement.</p>
<p>In order to delve into the ranks of workers and peasants, it is rapidly organizing mobile performance teams to practice theatrical work in the streets, rural areas, and public and private schools in cities. Naturally, the strength of a few people is not enough to complete this task.

<p>Lan Quifuf and Paul Kelly Star in "Prostitutes"</p>
<p>"Big Shanghai Ying" on "Blood on the Red Mansion"</p>
<p>Premiering at the Cathay on Friday</p>
<p>"Blood on the Red Mansion" The Case Against Mrs. Ames, is the first work starring European beauty star Madeleine Carroll under the banner of Bupaira after crossing from England to the United States, and co-starring George Brent. The story tells of a wealthy young woman whose unfortunate husband is assassinated, and her own beloved son is taken away by her aunt-in-law. All members of society accuse her of being an evil and promiscuous woman who murdered her husband. She is unjustly wronged and can only weep in secret. However, in order to survive and seek redress, the pain in her heart is beyond words to describe. Such a role can probably only be played by Madeleine Carroll, who has previously starred in "Great National Secrets" with Robert Donat and "Red and Iron Blood" with Comstock Wied, and has achieved good results. It is expected that after the release of "Blood on the Red Mansion," her fame will be on par with the most famous European stars. The film is scheduled to premiere at the Cathay on Friday.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Songjiang Obstruct Arrest of Thieves</h3>
<p>In this county's Qibao Town, which is connected to Shanghai City's Kunlian, the Qibao robbery case from last month led to the Shanghai City Chengjiaqiao Public Security Bureau capturing a thief named Wang Jinchuan. He confessed to having over a dozen accomplices, including Wu Amao. The victim, Wu Bingsheng, reported this to the Qibao Patrol Station. Learning that Wu Amao had returned to his village, police chief Yao Xiaogu led four officers to make an arrest on the night of the 14th. While en route, in the seventh jia of the fourth bao of the village, a villager named Wu Honggen came forward to obstruct them, inciting a mob to assault the police. Officer Jiao Youde was injured. When Wu Amao heard the commotion, he fled his home and escaped. The crowd then dispersed. The police chief reported this to the sixth sub-station, and under the order of Inspector Lu, Wu Honggen was to be detained. However, he went into hiding, fearing punishment. The next day, they discovered Wu Amao's hiding place and again led officers to capture him. Again, Wu Honggen came forward to obstruct, causing Wu Amao to escape. The police chief then arrested Wu Honggen and escorted him to Songjiang, requesting a review of the case.</p>

<h3>Planning a State Funeral for Zhang Taiyan</h3>
<p>Following the death of the great master of Sinology, Zhang Taiyan, the encoffining ceremony took place on the afternoon of the 16th at 4 PM. Many mourners attended, making it quite somber. After the encoffining, friends from various places arrived in a continuous stream to pay their respects. That evening at 8 PM, Zhang's wife, Madam Tang Guoli, took advantage of the gathering of all the disciples to address them before the coffin. She stated that her husband's success was the success of academic research. Regarding his posthumous works, which were scattered in various locations during his lifetime, she hoped they would be collected and published as a special collection. She also wished that the National Studies Lecture Hall, which he founded, be maintained to fulfill his ambition. She planned to convert the residence into a memorial hall, with the upstairs serving as a library. The friends decided to continue operating the National Studies Lecture Hall and organized a Zhang Taiyan Academic Committee. Shao Yuanchong, Zhang Mojun, Cai Yuanpei, Bai Wenwei, Zhang Yichen, and dozens of others were nominated as directors. They also planned to hold a state funeral, which Ding Weifen would coordinate with the Central Party Headquarters. An expanded memorial service would be held at the Confucius Temple. Zhang Shizhao would be requested to write the epitaph, and Wang Dong would draft the biography.</p>

<h3>Wuxi: Implementing Control of Vessels</h3>
<p>The county government of this county has ordered the establishment of a Vessel Inspection Office to prepare for the implementation of a vessel control system. This matter was submitted to and resolved at the 69th district chiefs' meeting. Each district will establish a main office and three to nine branch offices, depending on the size of the district, to achieve localized effectiveness. Yesterday, it was learned that the county government has separately determined the locations for the vessel inspection offices in each district, totaling seventy-two throughout the county. Orders have been issued to the district chiefs to immediately organize and establish these offices and begin inspecting incoming and outgoing vessels to eliminate the source of thieves and maintain security.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Coal Incident</h3>
<p>The Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau of this county discovered and seized 500 tons (thirteen boats) of stolen coal from Cheng in Liujiang on the North and South roads a few days ago. The coal was impounded and guarded by police. Bureau Chief Chen reported the information to the Administrative Inspector's Office for review. Commissioner Zang telegraphed the province to request instructions on how to handle the matter, as previously reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that after the seizure of the stolen coal, Ma Mochu and Zhu Changshou, sales representatives stationed in Wuxi, telegraphed the Mitsui &amp; Co. in Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, the company dispatched employee Mr. Konoe Shinsuke (Japanese) and Mr. Zhu Songtao (Ningbo native) to Wuxi yesterday. They stayed at the New World Hotel and went to the Commissioner's Office to meet with Commissioner Zang, requesting the return of the coal. Mr. Zang replied that the transport and sale of this coal in Wuxi might incite public outrage and cause disputes, so he had instructed the Public Security Bureau to send police to guard it. He had already requested instructions from the province and would follow them. Before receiving instructions, he could not return it. The Japanese and Chinese representatives left, unable to obtain their desired result.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Road Workers Cause Trouble by Making Demands</h3>
<p>The roadbed of the Yangfu Highway Bridge is now fully completed, and the road surface is ready to be paved, after which it will be open to traffic. The workers have now returned, but a group of over thirty bridge workers from the Changhua Company are still lingering in Gangkou Town, demanding subsidies from the town chief. Otherwise, they will loot the entire town and first take away a water buffalo from the town chief's family. As a result, the town chief, Jiang Kangbo, came to the county government in the city on the night of the 16th to report the matter. The county will now dispatch security forces to the village to disperse them.</p>
