<p>應覺悟昨死今生實事求是</p>
<p>具以身作則精力教化群眾</p>
<p>南京　蔣委員長十九日出席新運紀念會訓詞全文、主席、各位代表、同志、今天是新生活運動二週年紀念日、兄弟臨此紀念的典禮時候、自己心裏甚覺慚愧、因為兩年來「新生活運動」的聲名、已經遍傳中外、現在無論那個地方、那個國家、都知道中國在推行一種「新生活運動」、但是新生活運動的實效、究竟有多少呢、我們自己檢查的結果、知道我們的進步很少、雖經兩年之久、並沒有達到我們預期的目的、兄弟是新生活運動發起的一個人、平時很多地方、沒有盡到個人的力量、或許也是不能以身作則來風動感化、改造社會、以致新生活運動推行不能迅速、成效也不如預期、有負內外期望之殷切、自己實在慚愧、但是過去的時間已經過去、最要緊的是希望新生活運動從今天二週紀念以後、能各有特殊的進步、很快的得到最後的成功、要怎樣　能達到這個目的呢、當然要靠我們各界負領導責任的領袖、以及一切智識分子、大家能夠負起責任、共同一致來努力推行、所以兄弟今天想藉此機會、首先將推行新生活運動的要件、向各位說一說、第一要有「昨死今生」的決心、大家知道所謂「新運動」的「新」字、反面就是「舊」字、「生」字的反面就是「死」、「新生活運動」顧名思義、就是要「除舊布新」、和「起死回生」的生活革命運動、中國有兩句古話、拿來說明現在的新生活運動最為恰切、這兩句話、就是「從前種種譬如昨日死、以後種種譬如今日生、」我們必須將各個人以至整個社會國家、一切不良的腐敗的、換言之、就是舊的思想行動習慣風氣、一概革除、造成一個良好的、文明的新思想行動、就是新的習慣和風氣、然後我們　可以建築一個現代的國家、現在人家批評我們的國家為落後的國家、或說是非現代的國家、怎麼呌「非現代的」呢、說得好聽一點、就是「落後」、就是不能和人家並駕齊驅、說得不好聽一點、就是「腐敗」、就是「野蠻」、換言之、就是說過去的生活、這過去的生活、如果要說得文明些就是「死」的生活、與「非人」的生活、怎麼說死的生活呢、我再進一步說、凡是不藝術的、和不生產的生活、就是死的生活、我老實說、我們中國一般的生活、就是「非人」的生活、亦就是「死人」的生活、而非新生活、亦非現代的生活、我們現在新生活的目的、就是要將不知禮儀、不明廉恥非人的生活、變為明禮義知廉恥的「人」的生活、要將嫖賭鴉片等腐敗污穢死的生活、變成功為現代「生」的生活、如此　可與現代的人、和現代的各國、並駕齊驅、我們要做到這一步、最根本的一點、就是各人先要有一個決心「從前種種譬如昨日死、以後種種譬如今日生」、必須有了這種「昨死今生」的覺悟、　可以實行新生活、　可以推行新生運動、本來無論那個人、每天都有錯誤的事情、亦難免有不好的習慣、個人如此、整個社會國家也是如此、所以我們必須時時刻刻痛下反省的工夫、檢查自已的過失、發現自己的缺點、時時刻刻努力、來改正一切的過失、補救所有的缺點、繼續不斷的求進步、如此　可以「日新又新、」成功一個新的人、建立一個新的社會、和新國家、　算是真正實行新生活、推行新生活運動、今天到會的各位同志、都是各界的領袖、主管一部分的事情、大家可以反省、我們對於本身和自己所主管的機關學校團體、以及我們的家庭、能否時刻加以檢點、是否已經本著「昨死今生」的精神、來努力改進、據我看來、恐怕做到的還是很少、就是因為我們自己不嚴格的檢點的反省、所以自己種種的過失、種種的腐敗野蠻的生稍有、都不能發覺、一個人既不知道自己的壞處、當然更不知道社會和國家的弱點了、自然不會有「昨死今生」精神、來痛切改過、如此就永遠沒有進步、這樣的人民、這樣的國家民族、當然要受人家的侵侮壓迫、乃至於亡國、今天兄弟首先要將這種危險的現象、告訴各位、各位只要是不想做亡國奴、就應當要痛切反省澈底覺悟、以「昨死今生」的決心、來實行新生活、推行新生活運動、第二、我們要推行新生活運動、必須有「實事求是」的精神、新生活運動、直言之、就是要使全國國民的精神和行動現代化、我們知道現代是「科學的時代」、所謂「現代化」者、就是要「科學化」「組織化」和「紀律化」、概括的說、就是「軍事化」、科學的基本精神、就是要「實事求是、精益求精」分別來講就是要「真實」、不許有一點虛偽欺騙、要「精確」、不許有一點苟且含糊、最後更要「澈底」、不容許有一點因循苟且、或半途而廢惡習、由此可知我們的生活、要「科學化」、「軍事化」的意思、就是要澈底產除過去一切虛偽自私含糊因循苟且等一切不適合現代的積習、實實在在力行「整齊清潔簡樸勤勞迅速確實」的新生活、我們一定要有這種「實事求是」的新生活、我們一定要有這種「實事求是」的精神、才可以真正推行新生活運動、第三、我們推行新生活運動、必須要推行有「以身作則」的精力、來教化群眾、我們要推行新生活運動、當然要自己本身先能確實做到、才可以逐漸感化教導我們的部屬學生子弟、推而至於社會同胞都能實行新生活、必須從我們自己心裏做起、如果我們自己先能革心、切切實實檢查並改良自己的生活習慣、達到了新生活的要求、那是一般部屬學生子弟和社會上所有的民眾、一看到我們、就自然被我們感化、用不著我們一個一個去督責、一家一家去勸導、（末完）</p>

<p>逕啟者、昨日本會編輯之「上海市新生活運動二週年紀念特刊」、內有吳市長一新生活運動之實踐一文、因被手民錯排、先後倒置、深致歉忱、茲將原文重刋於後、以資更正、此致申報館、上海市新生活運動促進會、二月十九日</p>
<p>新生活運動，自蔣委員長倡導以來，茲已兩載，以其深合時代的需求，允爲復興民族之要圖，用能蔚爲風氣，全國翕從。</p>
<p>回顧晚近以來中國之歷史，各種運動，相繼勃興。但其效果，或則僅見一二志士仁人之提倡；而未爲一般民衆所奉行；或則僅有一時的興奮，而未有持久的力量。獨新生活運動則異乎是！蓋新生活運動者，乃係推行新政，復興民族，以及推進中國一切文化建設之原動力。新生活運動之基本要點，乃在本「苟日新，又日新，日日新」之精神，以及本「以前種種譬如昨日死，今後種種譬如今日生」之决心，蕩滌一切沈滯在社會底層之惡習頽風；鏑除一切深中人心之頽廢習性；期以養成一種堅苦卓絕，中正不苟，向上奮鬥的新生活習慣；而使全國人民之生活，能日臻合理化，科學化，生產化，革命化，軍事化，現代化與藝術化者也。</p>
<p>夫生活者，乃人生一切活動之總稱。亦即個人與國族，所以保障生存，發展生計，繁衍生命之種種行爲。倘使舉國上下，官吏則虛偽貪汚，人民則散漫麻木，成人則腐化昏庸，靑年則墮落放縱；富者則繁瑣浮華；貧者則卑惡混亂，則欲圖國家紀綱之整飭，社會秩序之維持，以及整個民族國家之解放與復興，豈非輾轍背馳。故改造生活，非特爲挽救頽風，振發人心之要圖；抑亦爲復興民族，推行新政，以及建設一切文化之動力焉。</p>
<p>考以往各種救國改造之運動，所以終難收效者，究其癥結，火部由於不切實際，不揣共本。蓋無論何種制度之推行，與社會風俗，人民習慣之關係，實至爲密切。中國過去之敎育，乃至一切政治，皆病於虛僞，而不求實際，以致法令無效，技術無用，機械無能。官守相同，效率終異；技術相同，成就各殊；機械相同，功用不一。故任何國家，於革故鼎新之後，必須風以動之，敎以化之，而後其政始得爲之治。蓋移風易俗之工作，其效較政敎爲允大，其用較政敎爲允廣，而其需要又較政敎爲允急。新生活運動，即爲移風易俗，振發人心，推進國運之中心工作；亦即爲目前復興民族，極不可緩之基本運動也。</p>
<p>唯是此種運動之推行，端賴全國人民之自覺自力，以身作則，始能推己及人，普及全國，蔚爲時代之風尚，形成時代之力量。吾國本爲禮義之邦，先聖先哲之遺敎，久已爲萬邦所共仰；然今日所以仍呈四維不張，綱紀廢弛之象；而列國甚且公然以無組織無敎化諸詞，爲喜笑怒駡之資者，此非我中國民族之無知，實由於後人之空言虛憍，不能力行耳。</p>
<p>故新生活運動之實質，在力行，不在空言；新生活運動成功之關鍵，端在禮義廉恥之實踐，而不在種種形式上之宜傳。</p>
<p>王陽明一代大儒，深知我國民衆之病根，因創知行合一之說，其言曰：</p>
<p>「知之眞切篤實處，即是行；行之明覺精察處，即是知；」</p>
<p>「未有知而不行者；知而不行，只是未知；」</p>
<p>「聖學只一個工夫，知行不可分爲兩事；」</p>
<p>「知者行之始，行者知之成！」</p>
<p>顏元（習齋）李　（怒谷）生當明末；亦倡力行之說，以挽狂瀾。顏氏之言曰：</p>
<p>「人之爲學，心中思想，口內談論。儘有千百義，不如身上行一理之爲實也。」</p>
<p>「寗爲一端一節之實，無爲全體大用之虛；」</p>
<p>「吾輩只向習行上做功夫，不可向言語文字上着力；孔子之書，名論語矣；試觀門人所記，却句句是行。」</p>
<p>「讀書無他道，只在行字着力，如讀「其爲人孝弟」，便要勉力孝弟。」</p>
<p>其徒李　，師承其志；亦有言曰：</p>
<p>「經書乃德行藝之簿籍也，所以詔習行，非資徒讀也。」今逢新生活運動二週紀念之日；承本會徵及拙稿；愚愧無似，忝爲指導。深慮此救亡復興之基本運動，將仍蹈以往空言之覆轍；因緣其言，藉資共勉。今後新生活運動之成就如何，今後中國民族之命運如何，亦唯視今後國人之力行如何而已矣！</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>三·本埠造紙廠之近况</p>
<p>本埠現存之新式造紙廠中，其規模較大者爲龍章天章等六七家，今將其沿革及近狀分述於後，以供各界參考：</p>
<p>一，龍章機器造紙公司　龍章創立於光緒三十二年，爲中國之第三老紙廠，廠址在本埠龍華路五號，發行所在新永安街十七號，爲股份有限公司組織，目下總經理爲龐萊臣氏，重要股東爲劉柏森，傳筱庵，龐贊臣諸氏，龐萊臣亦爲重要股東之一。該廠資本，據以前該廠向市商會之登記，爲規元三十四萬三千兩，二十二年該廠曾增加資本一次，但不知其確實數額。今據業中人意見，共計的在國幣一百萬元左右·該公司廠屋佔地二十餘畝，置有造紙機二架，電氣由該廠自行供給，雇有男女工人四百餘名。該廠向注重製造毛邊連史等紙，以雙龍爲商標，專備各商店印刷包紮之用。據云每月產量的三四百件，全年營業額達百萬元左右。前年該廠因財部增加關稅，洋道林售價昻貴，華廠有起而仿造之機會，遂向國外定購製造道林紙機器一部，於去年七月裝竣開工，所出之各磅道林紙，質地甚佳，竟與舶來品不相上下，委託各商號代售，每磅價格，的六角五分。該廠外埠銷路，前以華北爲主，今主要轉爲華中。</p>
<p>二，天章造紙廠天章分東西二廠，乃山以往倫章華章兩廠合併而成，前已音之。　章原爲李鴻章氏創辦，民十四因虧蝕關係，歸併爲天章之西廠，業章於歸併之前，會歷數度改變，民國四年由中俄商人合辦，後轉爲日商三菱公司經營，民國九年又改由劉柏森等接辦，更名寳源紙廠，至民十四年始改爲今日之天章東廠。天章初僅資本四十萬兩，後增爲六十萬兩，廢兩改元時，又增爲國幣八十萬元。東廠設於浦東陸家口，西廠設於楊樹浦黃浦碼頭，總發行所設於江西路泗涇路口，爲股份有限公司組織。劉柏森，王顯華，劉孟靖，劉仲開，汪曉芬等均爲該廠之董事。去年因事停工，開工後更名天章昌記。該廠東西廠均係租地造屋，東廠基地的四十餘畝，建造廠屋棧房六十餘間，範圍頗大，廠內置有網式造紙機三座，陽克式造紙機二座，打料機六部，煮料球三個，打漿機二部，五百匹馬力蒸汽機一部，鍋爐五座。惟廿二年曾遭回祿，燬機二部，前年該廠會購置軋光機一部，造紙機一部，配以八十五匹馬力之馬達一架，係德國產品，爲各廠所未有，値價在十二萬兀左右。西廠廠基的七八畝，內有網式造紙機一部，煮料球二個，打料機七台，其他被紙機等設備，均極完備。兩廠常雇工人約三百餘名，職員二十餘人。該廠出品爲道林紙，模造紙，二號紙，夫士紙，連史紙毛邊紙等，以飛艇爲商標。東廠製造粗貨，如包紗紙，次報紙等，每日的產一萬一二千磅至一萬五六千磅不等，全年可產三百五六十萬磅。西廠原爲製造道林紙，後改造連史毛邊，今則注重道林紙模造紙之製造，銷行頗廣，每日產量的三萬磅，全年的七百五六十萬磅。該廠出品銷路，多數銷售本埠（各大書局爲其重要顧客），華中華南次之。</p>
<p>三，江南造紙公司江南創設於民國十四年，當時適値抵制日貨之際，該廠所產連史，毛邊，海月等中國紙，頗有發展之機會，但產量不多，待新機購來，抵貨風潮已成過去，至一二八事變爆發，該廠出品代日貨而起，始獲巨利，（當時每日出貨由三四十件增至二百件，猶嫌不敷分配。）該廠主要董事爲吳耀庭，虞洽卿，孫洪芬，張稷臣諸氏，董事兼經理爲鄭壽芝君，係有限公司組織，總廠設於曹家渡浜北光復路，分廠設於高資增課洲，（專製蘆漿以供總廠之用）事務所設於愛多亞路三十八號。該廠出品以福祿爲商標，質地可與日貨抗衡。銷路遍全國，至其造紙原料之蘆漿，允爲該廠之專利發明品，在高資分廠購地四千畝，培植之製造之，以三環爲商標。今將總分兩廠之設備，分述於後，以備查考：</p>
<p>地基　在上海曹家渡之工廠，所購基地計十八畝四分三厘，高資分廠基地一百餘畝，叉在增課洲買進產蘆洲地四千餘畝。</p>
<p>房屋　本埠有三樓辦公室一幢，物料倉庫一幢，選料間二，壓劃間一，煮料間一，打漿間一，製紙間二，切斷整理間二，打包間一，製品倉庫一幢，蒸氣動力間一，悉用洋松白鐵建造，此外又有儲水池，總水塔，漂粉解化池，膠料儲藏池，鐵工室，木工室，電汽變壓室，電氣開關室，工人食堂，門衛室，又一百十三尺之水泥烟囱一座。高資分廠內，除鍋爐間外，有廠屋七座，亦以洋松白鐵造成，殊爲堅固。</p>
<p>機器　廠內主要造紙機器，現有一百吋圓鋼陽克式機器一部，又六十五吋圓鋼陽克二部，十二吋徑高壓煮料球二座，荷囒式打漿機八具，三十呎長藍開休鍋爐二只，德法名廠製造電汽馬達十六部，共計四百匹馬力，冷却式大機器一部，計一百五十匹馬力，（又有小機一部，乃係試騐樣品所用，現在用以製造粗紙）又十二吋半口徑五百尺深度之大自流井一，裝設高壓冷氣抽水機一部，每日出水一百萬加倫以上，又有十六呎車床一部，八吋車床一部，十二呎鉋床一部，鑽床鉗床等種種工具，升降機三座，又有小鐵道一千五百尺，以備裝運貨物，高資分廠內裝有二十八呎長藍開休鍋爐一只，五千瓦特電燈機一部，四十八匹馬力蒸汽引擎一部，十二呎徑高壓煮料球三座，搬拖機一部，圓旋鋸斷機一部，四道軋滾機一部，剪斷機一部，篩斗淸理機一部，皮帶運送機二部，斗式運輸機一部，水壓蘆漿機二部，水壓打包機一部，總分所機器總値為數甚巨。</p>
<p>民國十七年該公司爲圖發展起見，經第三屆股東會議决，增加資本，分二期進行：第一期增加資本六十萬元，連原有資本四十萬元，合成一百萬元，擴充後，擬在上海總廠，增添六十五吋製紙機一部，仍仿製國產連史毛邊等紙，在高資分廠增設煮料球三座，製漿機二部，用以製造蘆漿，又擬在高資添購蘆洲一萬畝！以便多產蘆葦，第二期添招一百萬元，合成二百萬元，擬在高資分廠，添裝新式製紙機器二部，及電汽動力設備，以製造報紙有光紙道令紙包皮紙等。該項計劃提出後，外界贊成者亦復不少，聞第一步添招之六十萬元，已招得數十萬元。　（未完）</p>

<p>『呀，喬恩伯伯原來一直是在勞老先生的公司裏任職，勞先生的一個股東，說他在商業上良心的顧慮，幾乎是太過分了，在別的一切事上，他也是無可　議的。另一個人說金錢不足酬償喬恩伯伯對他的忠誠，最後老爹爹所說述的，尤足見他最高的品格。喬恩伯伯有一次在某人的地方辦事，後來發現那人是要欺騙。並且要伯伯幫他一同欺騙，伯伯拒絕了，雖然那人許他以高俸，他終於不為所動。那人怒了，說道：「你死守那種原則，那你在事業上是不會得意的了」，伯伯却反駁道，「反正我永不想着棄掉了它們而求得意的」，便離開了那職務，寗可改就一個難得多，苦得多的位置』。</p>

<p>— 王天予</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一九二九年的經濟恐慌彌漫了全世界以後，人民的購買力普遍地降落。接著是物價暴落，貿易減退，全世界的各種生產和消費率，也跟著降落下來，其中最受影響的，就是原料。蠶絲是原料之一，當然受同樣的打擊。可是又因為不是必需品的緣故，衰落率更超出大多數原料。自一九二九年至一九三三年的五年間，蠶絲貿易率降落七四％，絹織物貿易率降落六三％，生產率則自一九二九年至一九三四年的六年間，降落一一％，消費率更降落二九％，致生絲的世界貯藏量，自一九二九年的九·一千噸，增至一九三四年的一七·三千噸。開歷年來的新紀元，急得世界最大蠶絲供給國日本，忙不迭的限制生產。以期挽救蠶絲的價格，補救國內蠶農的損失。中國是個一切都感落後的國家，當此世界蠶絲市場全握在日人掌握中的今日，其所受的影響，當然不祇是經濟恐慌這一個原因，除掉日絲的傾銷和人造絲的激增給予以重大的威脅以外，尚因國際間匯兌率的關係，受到金賤銀貴的無上苦痛，據海關報告，一九三四年的蠶絲輸出量，僅五萬四千餘担，上海洋莊絲市中級廠經一三——二二條份，每担最低價至四百六十元。致上海開工絲廠，在年底僅十家，絲車約二千部而已。這樣一個空前的製單，使得國內許多蔚　的桑林，大都變成其他作物的栽培領域。其間雖有政府的提倡管理，和人民的努力改進，可是終覺創深痛巨，一時不易獲效。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>一九三五年的上半期，絲市承上年份低落之餘風，除一月份上半月因海外春銷略動，需要增加，美日英法絲價，一致步漲，國內綢廠，亦因補充春季原料，頗有購進，一時絲價頗呈緊昂，上海洋莊絲市，中等廠經會一度高至每担五五〇元以外；華絲絲市，即因日絲傾銷及金賤銀貴，匯率鬆弛等關係，扯價步步趨跌。五月下旬，美復興運動由法院宣告死刑後，更趨消沉，迨六月份止，中等廠經每担平均價，僅四二〇元，開輓近未有之新紀錄。唯下半期自七月份起，因世界經濟略呈景氣，絲銷驟增，更因蠶絲生產減少之關係，存貨寥落，致絲價逐步趨堅。紐約倫敦里昂橫濱等埠，一致上漲，其中除里昂因法國政潮等關係較遜外，其他各地，在十月份中所開絲價，俱已超過一九三三年之每月平均價。上海絲市，也隨而扶搖直上，高級廠經曾衝破千元大關，茲根據蠶絲統計月報所載，錄一九三五年美英法日及我國上海之絲價於下：</p>

<p>南洋僑胞之愛用國貨，共熱烈之心情，較國內人有過之無不及，顧苦於重洋相隔，不知祖國之工藝進步何若？製製之出品質地何若？許多僑胞，尙有以二三十年之目光，來衡量祖國國貨者。此皆僑胞未盡深知最近國貨之狀况致之。故南洋各地，非有大規模之國貨展覽，俾一般華僑，耳濡目染，眞知灼見，以認識眞正之國貨不可。最近國人有見於此，每遇機會，必以國貨樣品運往展覽，日內並有南洋商業考察團之組織，俾國內外之愛用國貨者，沆瀣一氣，相與提携，此固最近國貨史上一良好之工作。惟是南洋區域廣漠，倘固定一處，未免曠日持久，缺乏靈敏之機能，而不易普遍奏效。嘗與徐君談話，徐君認為應由招商局特開一專輪，度徵國內之國產貨品，在船展覽，每到一地，招待當地僑胞，赴船參觀，並為說明，予以便利，是參觀者恍歸故國，有喜不自勝之槪，其效力之偉大為何如耶？積此意已久，而　欲實踐此言，未有機會。最近上海國貨運動聯合會開會，有人提議謂最近中央政府，有派艦赴南洋宣慰僑胞之舉，曷勿乘此機會，徵集各國貨工廠出品，在艦舉行國貨展覽，俾政府於宣慰之餘，藉可以國產昭示僑胞，咸知祖國國貨之眞相。則愛國者，油然起景仰祖國之思，樂用國貨者，欣然動購買國貨之心。我知政府當局，最近獎勵國貨，不遺餘力，社會人士，對於國外貿易，尤具熱心，大可通力合作，以促其成。記者之意，政府當局，應由事業部主辦，會同海軍部僑務委員會共同籌備，指定一艦，尅日出發：徵集國貨出品之事，可責成國際貿易局商品檢騐局會同中華國貨產銷合作協會，中華工業國外貿易協會，從事徵品。三個月內，可與南洋商業考察團同時出發，此為提倡國貨之最澈底辦法，尤在國貨史上為最光榮之一頁，記者欣幸之餘，敬拭目以觀其成。</p>

<p>— 倚雨</p>
<p>山西，是我國較富著的一省，也是吾國內地交通最發達的一省。自省政十年建設計畫實施以來，各種建設事業，自有相當成效；尤其對於國貨工業之振興，不遺餘力。迄于今日，日常生活必需貨品，已大半能自給自足，少有仰給他地。以後如續努力提倡，則將來之成就，誠未可限量。所以要大家服用國貨，必先要振興我們的實業，這是一定的要素。有了優良的國貨工業品，那自然而然容易推銷盛行，也不需外求了。這事實我們看了山西的情形，就可以知道的。但山西之建設事業，雖很顯著進步，然其國貨工業實况，究屬如何，外人尙多不甚明瞭。爰將山西工業進展槪况，略作簡短之記述，以餉讀者。</p>
<p>紡織工業　山西之紡織工業，自手工業破產之後，社會人士，鑒於需要殷切，乃相率興辦以新式機器生產之紡織工業。惟以外貨傾銷，成本昂貴，以致銷路阻滯，未能發達。降及省政十年建設計畫實行，賴政府之扶植，於是衰落之紡織工業，遂漸呈復蘇之勢。據最近統計，全省棉織工廠共有十四家，資本總額約八十餘萬，年產總值達一千一百餘萬，較之以前已進步多多矣，至若毛織工廠，則甫吿萌芽，全省僅三家，資本總額五十二萬員，年產總值五萬餘元。此種工廠出品，頗得社會人士之歡迎，大有供不應求之勢；故其發展，當可有長足之進步也。</p>
<p>機械工業　機械工業，大率由前兵工廠改組之壬申製造廠擴充而來，資本固屬雄豊，製品當可精民。現在共計有工廠五家，資本總額五百四十萬另七千元，（未計入者一家），年產總值五十九萬八千元，（未計入者三家）。類此各廠對於山西建設工作關係甚大，故當局亦特別注重。</p>
<p>化學品工業　化學品工業，尙在萌芽時代茲將現有各廠列下：　火柴工廠四家，資本總額三十九萬元，年產總值三十萬元，（未計入者一家）。　造紙工廠三家，資本總額九十三萬元，年產總值三十萬零九千元。　硫硝工廠一家，未詳。　料器工廠一家，資本一萬元，年產總值三萬七千元。　皮革工廠一家，資本總值二十萬元，年產未詳。　陶器工廠一家，資本十三萬元，年產未詳。　建築品工業中之較大者惟西北洋灰廠一家，資本總額三十萬元，年產未詳。觀此即可知山西化學品工業之幼稚矣。惟以大規模工廠，恒由初步雛形組織發展而成，故亦不可稍加忽視，更宜扶植其發展也。</p>
<p>其他之飲食品工業，如麵粉、烟草、酒、汽水等，衣帽工業及文化工業等，尙形落後，無顯著進展。而在前舉三項看來，像化學品工業，雖亦尙未十分發達，但在不久的將來，一定可作順利之發展的。而山西全部的服用國貨，自亦即可實現也。</p>
<h3 id="c174">江南化學工業製造廠參觀記 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 翽</p>
<p>年來我國化學工業，日趨發達，本市化學工業廠的設立，如雨後春筍，大有蓬勃的氣象。以製造基本化學品的三酸而言，即有製造硫（Sulphuric　Acid）的開成造酸廠，製造監酸（Hydrochoric　Acid）的天原電化廠，規模都很宏大。最近更有江南化學工業製造廠成立。記者承該廠經理趙也辰君及總工程師薛濟明博士之招待，得會同潘仰堯程寰西單岩基三先生前往瞻仰。茲將參觀所得情形，略述如後：</p>
<p>江南化學工業製造廠，成立於去年四月，其主要產品為水醋酸（Glacial　Acetic　Acid），副產品為木精（Wood　Spirit　or　Woed　Aleohol）木炭（Wood　Charceal）及柏（Tar）。資本定為國幣二十万元，由沈伸毅張榮初赵也辰薛濟明等所發起組織。地址在閘北共和新路柳營路口，估地約十八畝，廠屋寬敞，布置極為合理。機械排列，及一切工程設計等，都是專家計畫的。去年八月間，出品已吿成功，產量和成分，均能符合夙願。其水醋酸之成色，達百分之九十九度半，木精打百分之九十九度，實為國產工業原料所僅見，足與舶來品相抗衡。尤其是哦難能可貴的，就是牠所用的原料，完全是國貨。像湖州等處的栗柴，聞成造酸廠的硫酸，以及土窖中的石灰，這三種就是製造產品的原料。</p>
<p>現在該廠有工人八十餘人，牠的生產量，每天可出水醋酸三千磅，木精七百八十磅，木炭一百三十担，柏油六千磅，但三千磅的水醋酸，還不夠市上的需要，所以該廠很可以大事擴充呢。</p>
<p>上述產品的製造程序，是首將栗柴裝列在鐵車的上面，由輕便鐵道把柴車推入乾溜鍋，然後將鍋蓋固封，灶下燃煤，約歷八小時，鍋內栗柴，因熱蒸發，一部份成為氣體，由烟道上升，經柏油分濾器，油因　下沉，餘汽上升，並用捕氣機將汽打入冷却管，管內冷水循環，汽遇冷凝固，變成木醋油而下沉。（按此項木醋油中，即含有木精，醋酸及其他雜質）。再把牠吸入中和桶內，加以適當分量的石灰，使牠中和（Neutralization）。並以拌動機打拌均勻，然後由引入木精塔，那末木精就脫離而去了。餘物再經過蒸汽機乾燥器及烘板，就成為乾燥的醋酸石灰（Calcium　Acetate，亦稱醋酸鈣）。然後移到蒸溜部份，以硫酸與之化合，放入分解器內而蒸之，同時將裝在分解器內的拌動機開動，使牠不停頓地拌動，並藉眞空加速分解作用，經過六小時後，醋酸所含的石灰，都被硫酸吸收，而得七十五度左右之醋酸，單獨分離而出。再引入粗製醋酸器，經初度蒸發後，水分排除，則可提高至九十度以上。更入精製醋酸器蒸之使淨，即得高度的水醋酸。至於乾溜鍋中的木柴，均已燼成木炭，經過相當時間後，拖入冷却鍋中，侯冷取出，遂成木炭。</p>
<p>至於講到產品的用途，很是廣大，現在把牠每一種的用途，分述如下：</p>
<p>水醋酸　是印染工業及製造人造絲等所必需的原料。如果將水醋酸和燃料混合後，能是燃料永不退色。以前我國各印染廠所用的原料，完全仰給於外貨，據海關進出口貿易統計的報吿，去年全年進口共達六六〇，五五七公斤，計值國幣三一一，三四三元，中以某國貨為最多，約占全數十分之七。</p>
<p>木精　為賽珞璐廠，新藥廠，及製造人造翡翠鑽石等物之必需原料。</p>
<p>木炭　供作燃料，工用家用，均所必需。</p>
<p>柏油　亦名木焦油，大都用於機器及木材之塗料，　為橡膠及油漆等工業的原料。</p>
<p>參觀後，我感覺到中國的化學工業，如果能努力振興，使之加增生產效率，减輕成本，那末每年數萬萬的漏　，不無挽回的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c175">國貨零話 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 追誠</p>
<p>報載：「去歲一月至二月一年來進口之未列名香水脂粉，共計六十三萬九千四百四十八元。」這眞是一個駭人聽聞的數目！</p>
<p>用化裝品的多是有錢人，有錢人腦海裏又多印着一個「洋貨總是好的」的信念，所以結果造成這樣一個絕大的漏巵。</p>
<p>化裝品不是絕對不可用的，而國貨化妝品也不一定都不是好的，譬如他現在去用五洲廠出品的「三三香水」「一三香水」，他必定不會感覺到怎樣失望，並且可以給他减少一筆費用。</p>
<p>市商　通吿各業，以血誠推銷國貨。「學誠推銷國貨，」看起來似乎是一句空話，但事實上要提倡國貨，非全國人都放出「學誠」來不可，否則國貨前途，無論如何，不會發展。</p>
<p>說起「洋貨傾銷，」還不是由於國人沒有「血性」的原故，所以一方面喊着提倡國貨，而一方面市場中依然　目都　舶來品，這簡直太無學誠了。</p>
<p>所以要使國貨能戰勝洋貨，唯有希望國民都氣「血」充足，精「誠」團結，這更要靠國貨補劑自來血的效力了。</p>

<h3 id="c178">「國學基本叢書簡編」之商討 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾怡</p>
<p>在近幾年來，國故整理，在出版界裏面，頗佔重要的位置；無論那一家書店，都在努力的翻印古書。這種動向的功罪如何，我們姑且不去問他；然而失之於濫，失之於雜，這許多毛病，確是不能免的。</p>
<p>抓住出版界的權威者商務印書館，在這一方面，也很努力。四庫全書的刋印，珍本的續出，再有叢書集成，國學基本叢書的單行發賣；在這種種方面，不能不算是他的偉大的貢獻。在最的前天，報紙上又有「國學基本叢書簡編」的預約廣告了。</p>
<p>在他的綠起裏面，我們很可看出他所以要「簡編」的理由來：</p>
<p>……國學基本叢書，為研究國學者之津梁。數年以來，先後出版多至百餘種。範圍日廣，全部售價亦漸巨，逐覺尚有簡抉之必要。因就該叢書中擇其人人應讀之書五上種，　為「簡編」……</p>
<p>誠然，售價低廉，以一百二十本書，只賣二十塊錢；携带便利，装潢整齊，都用平裝六開本；不能不算是這一部簡編的特色。然而，關於他簡抉的方法，和所簡抉得來的五十種書名，不能不有所商討。</p>
<p>這一部簡編，共分十二類。即讀書指南，哲學，社會科學，語文學，應用　術，美術，詩文總集，詩文別集，詞曲，詩文評，歷史，地理遊記是。這十二類中，個人認為很有値得商討的，現在分下來說：</p>
<p>讀書指南類　這一類共選書目答問，經學通論，諸子平議，文史通義這四部書。據個人的揣測，選者的用意，一定是書目答問是總論，其餘分任經史子集四方面。不過個人以為史學和文學，在國學上也很佔重要位置，决不是文史通義一部書，所能包括的。所以個人的主張，是至少在史學方面，應當添一部趙翼的廿二史剳記。（因為文學方面，有詩文評一類的兩部書，可以應用。</p>
<p>應用技術類　國學兩字的範圍，不是在此地所能討論的；然而個人總以為應用技術這一類，似乎不　當列入這一部「簡編」狹狹的十二類之中。假如應用技術是可以成功一類的話，那末內經素間本草綱目的醫藥，又何嘗不可以成功一類呢！所以個人的主張，應用技術類應當取消。</p>
<p>美術類　這一類已選的兩部書，還可以用，不過個人主張要加添兩部。在書法方面，添包世臣的藝舟雙楫；在繪書方面，添張彥遠的歷代名書記。</p>
<p>詩文總集類　這一類，詩　得太多了。文，只有文選一部；個人以為至少要添一部人必讀的散文總集古文辭類篡，才不至於有文少詩多的毛病。</p>
<p>詩文別集類　這一類所遺的，有一個絕大的缺點，就是唐以前作家，都沒選到。個人以為要加上陶淵明和曹子建兩個人的集子，才算合式。否則，又免不了有偏重的形態。</p>
<p>詞曲類　詞僅有總集而沒有別集，這是很奇怪的一點。曲的總集不選元曲選，而選陽　白雪，這也是値得懷疑的。所以個人的主張，以為詞別集應當加白石，夢窓，稼軒　家：而曲應當加元曲選。</p>
<p>歷史類　歷史的羅列四種紀事本末，則是極不錯的。不過選史記而不選其他的三史——前後漢書，三國志，也是很奇怪的一件事。假如說是取史記的文章好，那麼，就根本不應當列入歷史類？何况他三史的文章雙不壞呢！所以站在史的立塲上說，四史是必須全要選的。以上是就他所有的各類，來討論的。除了這七點以，個人還有些關於其他方面的意見，順便提出來討論一下：</p>
<p>在商務印書館所登的廣告上，他說這部簡編有四大特點。第一就是「要籍咸備」。根　個人在上面所討論的七點，似乎這部簡編，還夠不上這個程度。齊民要術，天工開物，陶說（應用技術類），能算是「要籍」嗎？前後漢書，三國志，元曲選，古文辭類纂，能不算是「要籍」嗎？所以這此地方，實在是商務印書館一時匆促，沒請國學專家去選擇，以致發生的弊端。我們很希望商務印書館以後不要急於出版求售才好。要知道這影響於出版事業，文化前途，都是很大的。</p>
<p>他們的第三個特點是，一律斷句。不錯，斷句以後，是可以便閱讀，助理解的。不過中國的古籍，往往因為斷句，而發生很大的糾紛；因此，句讀在國學方面，常是一個很重大的問題。譬如荀子，老子，荘子，墨子，管子，韓非子，尚書，左傳，史記等書，以前的學者，對於句讀，都很有疑問。所以個人的主張，以為中國古籍，無須斷句，儘管讓讀者自已去領悟。否則，如有誤斷，那更是貽害不淺了。</p>
<p>這個簡編所列的各書，有的有注，有的無注，這在個人覺得要統一一下才好。像詩文別集裏面的韓柳歐陽王諸集，儘有方世舉的韓集注，王先謙的蘇詩注，可代參考。像這樣的單印白文，似乎不是讀者所需要的。</p>
<p>小說，在以前一般人的心目中，的確以為是不足道的：想不到這一部簡編中竟沒有小說一類。個人以為唐宋的短篇小說，和明清的水滸紅樓，至少說，應當是人人必讀的；這在選抉方面，不能不說是一個缺點。</p>
<p>上面說了好多，個人并不是向商務印書館有所攻擊。個人因為牠在中國出版界裏，是一個舉足重輕而引人注目的一員，怕以不揣胃味，敢作極誠懇的貢獻。</p>
<h3 id="c179">介紹「中國娼妓史」 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦秋</p>
<p>娼妓的問題，在社會問題中，實在是一個很重大的問題。有些人主張公娼，以防梅毒的蔓延；有些人主張禁娼，以止奸淫的罪惡：關於這兩說的孰是孰非，我閃姑且不去管它。但是我們對於娼妓的成因，可以堅决的说，是社會不景氣的影響。蓋社會經濟破產，一般婦女，無路可走，逐不得不出於賣淫一途。辜鴻銘博士曾這樣的說過，「妓女的賣淫，並不是賣淫，而是賣窮」！這句話多麼的沉痛啊！</p>
<p>關於中外學者閃對於娼妓的意見，據聖湯麦司說：「都會中妓女的賣淫，好像宮殿的陰溝。假使宮殿沒有陰溝，宮殿將成為臭惡不堪的地步。」德國的柏烈爾說：「婚姻是市民世界的性生活的一面，其他一面就是賣淫。婚姻是性的正面，而賣淫則為其裏面。」德國的名醫扣恩氏也說過：「賣淫不　是應該寛容的亞事，而且可以說必要的惡事。　這，我們也不去管它，且說娼妓制度的起原。有人以為是始於管仲，歷史上告訴我們：管仲曾經設過女　三百，以利行旅。但是這娼妓究竟是否由管仲發起，還有研究的必要。可惜中國沒有專書可以參考，雖然報紙雜誌上，間有一鱗半爪的記載，也都略而不詳。這眞是一件憾事！</p>
<p>最近，生活書店裏，出版了一部「中國娟妓史」，著作者是王書奴，書的價値是法幣一元，書的頁數，計達三百五十六頁。這部書是研究娼妓制度的一部創作。作者對於娼妓的起源，叙述得非常詳盡。全書共分六章：第一章是引論。第二章是巫娼時代，由殷代成湯起，到紂王亡國為止為第一期。計自西歷紀元前一千七百八十三年起，共六百四十四年。第三章為奴隸的娼妓，及官娼的發生時代。由西周起，到東漢滅亡止，計自西歷紀元前一千一百二十二年起，至西歷紀元後二百一十八年止，為第二期，共一千三百四十睥。第四章為家妓（即歌妓）和奴隷娼妓時代，由三國起，至南北朝和隋朝滅亡止，（紀元後二百二十年），共四百三十五年。第五章為官妓最盛的時代，即唐朝；宋朝；元朝；明朝四朝，（紀元後六百一十八年），是為第四期，共一千〇二十八年。第六章是私人經營娼妓時代，自滿清入關以後，即一千六百四十四年起，為第五期，共二百八十八年。對於各種材料，搜集得非常完備，的確可以說是現在很有價値的一部書籍—，在這娼妓頭號題成為社會重要問題的時候。</p>
<p>這一部中國娼妓的取材，的確可以說是非常的　　，在目前禁娼的聲音高唱入雲的當兒，一般人大可以　一部看看；　其是研究娼妓問　的人們，更不可以不看。因為這部書不但叙述娼妓的起源，和娼妓的演變，就是娼妓制度發生的原因，娼妓制度的背景，娼妓制度與社會的關系，我們都可以因這部書而有相當的明瞭，並且還可以知道不和關於娼妓　趣聞。所以我以為這部中國娼妓史，是有介紹的必要的。</p>
<p>最後，再來補充幾句，就是中國娼妓史的作者王書奴君，完全是以學者的態度，而作成此書，供研究娼妓問題的人們研究，其中並沒有作者的私見，這的確是難能可貴的。</p>
<h3 id="c180">書店雜景（續） <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>（十一）出版新書</p>
<p>自新書店的出版新書的潮流來看，除了一二家有其他特定的方針外，全部的新書業差不多是一部投機史。自然，書店的出書，在相當的範圍內，必得適應客觀的需要，並且有時還得去發明，並進而去創造那種與文化有關的需要。但是，祇是一味的隨波逐流，追隨人後，粗製濫告，則雖有新書店，還不如無之。</p>
<p>如以形式的階段來分，則新書業的發展，可說是由於文學書所引起。在軍閥政治重壓之下，智識份子的苦悶，最好的自必祇有向文學上去求發洩。因之，前期創造死的浪漫文學，大受青年的歡迎，北平語絲社的諷刺文字，亦受大家的崇拜。創造社門市部成立，北新書局遷，光華泰東生意利市，於是一哄而起，有許多新書店產生。這個潮流，可稱為文學的時期。</p>
<h3 id="c181">怎樣看電影？（下） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 吳明毓</p>
<p>第三，本書指示出電影决不是僅有單純的「娛樂的價値」。這種作用以外，它有更重要的「社會的價値」。換句話說，它並非僅供人們有　時的消遺，　更顯示人生的各方面，剖析事物問題的性質，提供人們以良善解决的模楷與推斷。實在，電影不唯是社會娛樂的良物，而也是社會敎育的利器。從使觀看電影的人祇求娛樂，但觀衆的知識，態度和品行却不知不覺受銀幕的意識所潛移默化了。</p>
<p>第四，本書最後還建議今後影片的　製應多側重於社會的，人生的問題方面，如類似「西綫無戰事」，「亡命者」等性質的影片宜多產生。這無疑的是極有意義的提論。又說：「今後電影的主要目的不在營利，應在為大衆人民的敎育和娛樂。」這確乎是精當之言。自然，是否可以如此達到那是另外一回事。</p>
<p>總而言之，這本書是為啟發人們養成選擇和鑑賞電影能力而作的良好讀物。除了說明電影製作的經過與技術外，且注意於電影對社會能發生的好壞影響的闡術，并提出將來的改革計劃。——原著係由美國一敎育研究委員會指定專家所編供給青年學生的讀物。洪深先生在他的序裏說：「我以為是電影有三個階段。最初祇是看熱閙；稍進步能看故事；須是那對於電影技巧有了相當理解的人　能眞正地欣賞電影的藝術。這本書裏所講的一些基本知識，確是可以增加讀者底鑑賞力——和愉快的。」希望中國的電影觀衆都成為第三階段的鑑賞者！</p>
<p>最後我對於這本書的翻譯不能不說一兩句話。雖然我不想作校對的功夫或是吹毛求疵的工作，然而那譯述的文筆是不能令人滿意的。文句往往冗長生硬，令人一望而知那是「直譯」的結果。普通的讀物固不必一定求「雅」，但千萬不可因求「信」而弄得不「達」起來。譯者的筆法也許為求「忠實」，但有些地方太遠背中國文學的的成規了，甚至豆點也很吝使用。例如：或許最通常的運用聲音的錯誤是精確地複產一切的聲音照實生活中發現的一般的企圖。」（頁一七七）「在優越地導演的和精巧地構成的影片中這些各種攝寫定是這樣巧妙地構成的影片中這些各種攝寫定是這樣巧妙地被運用着使你不覺得正在應用多樣的攝影機距離。」（頁一三九）這不過隨便翻來的例子罷了。一本好的譯本，應該使人——無論是通西文或否的人很暢快地讀下去；除非那原著本來就是乾澀無味的</p>
<p>這本書是被列為「星期標準書」第十種。洪深先生選定。依據「星期標準書出版原則」第三條：「星期標準書出版原則」第三條：「星期標準書之文筆須通達簡明。」這本書欦未曾達到這個「標準」。我以為雖不必要重譯，但在不背原義之下，譯者應有在重版時加以修潤之義務，因為「標凖書」之所以成為「標準書」原有客觀的價値，而在電影認識需要之今日，一般讀者决不能因此而被　喪其興趣或甚至失掉勇氣！</p>

<p>— 周有仁</p>
<p>——是不姙之根源——</p>
<p>從內分泌之立塲上而言，女子之月經障礙，多源於卵巢機能異常而來。故欲矯正月經障礙，不外在卵巢機能上去研究。一般由卵巢機能失常而來之月經障碍，有無月經，月經地使或過多，頻發性月經，稀發性月經，不正常之予宮出血等，凡有此等月經病者，又往往影響於其他方面，如神經衰弱，意識不明，精神沈彥，心中怔忡，失眼不安，貧血，白帶下，性的不感等，人羊有幸福之事，於彼無份。往往因家庭不寧，而萌厭世自殺者。</p>
<p>「補女容」為德國最新發明之調整月經藥，凡由卵巢機能失常之一切月經病，悉能糾正之。因「補女容」是採用雌性之機能旺盛動物內分泌製成，對於此種卵巢細胞成熟過早或過遲，均能作根本排除，而使重生健全之細胞，故卵巢機能即獲正常之發展，而一切月經病亦歸消失矣。又「補女容」一藥凡是內分泌機能失常之人，如未老先衰，神經痛，頭目眩暈，腰酸腿冷，白帶下甚多，服之均著卓效，且可自由購服，一無流弊。</p>

<p>崇明婦人陳王氏，於去年秋間，挈同十歲女兒小妹離鄉來滬，投浦東訪尋胞姊，在途遭同鄉人力車夫白二誘往家內，强佔爲妻，該氏以人地生疏，惟有一任擺佈。嗣白二前妻之子（年僅五齡）因病夭殤，白二之父白登堂以王氏不應將孩虐待致死，因此常懷不懌，本年廢歷正月十三日，潛將小妹領出，由人力車夫施桂華介紹，賣與浦東沈家弄萬壽菴住持老尼慧林之徒永園爲小尼，計身價洋三十元，媒金二元，事後陳王氏查悉前情，不禁悲痛萬分，逢人哭訴，觀衆代抱不平，報知該管警所……諭着一併收押候究。</p>
<p>上述的一干人犯將受到如何處分？這是法律問題，並且現在正「收押候究」中，我捫丟開不談。而在法律之外，我們却有二點感想：一，當局現在正在着手婢女登記，而在所謂救濟婢女聲中，却依舊有這樣的事情發生，可見救濟婢女問題，决不是單純的救濟救濟就能了事的，它將包含在整個社會問題中，在整個社會制度改革之後才方始有辦法；二，所謂四大皆空，六根淸凈的出家人，現在已全不是原始的逃避塵世的勾當了，現在的所謂出家人，已禁不住爲資本主義所同化，而成爲一種「職業」，上海到處可見的「佛店」固然是這一個推論的最有力的鐵瞪。</p>
<p>像「幼尼獲救還俗」案中的小妹那樣遭遇，或者類似這樣的遭遇，普天之下有多少？未來的類此遭遇者又有多少？我們實在不能設想，也不敢設想；不過有一句話却是可以肯定說的，就是：「幼尼獲救還俗案」中的小妹，她祇是類似的不幸者的遭遇中，一個小小的浪花而已？</p>
<p>固然，小妹與人所不同的，大概是被賣之外，十而收買者却是一個所謂六根淸凈的出家人，所以使我們更多一些感想，更使我們對這個社會有深一步的認識；然而要是我們把這個問題更推想開去，例如現在的收買人者，以前也正是被人所受買者，那麼，這又作何解釋？推而至於始作俑者，又爲什麼要離人骨肉？則我們也將難以個人的得失功過來給它一個說明罷。</p>
<p>離人骨肉，自然是應受法律的嚴厲的制裁，然而法律制裁，有時顯得不够，則文將該有如何辦法？而法律之外的救濟婢女的所謂登記，能不能收到預防並禁絕的效果？則又是我們所不能不擔心的。</p>

<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>山路已經灰黯了。我踏着蒼茫的夜色，踽踽地在咖基摩雅山的迷霧似的森林里趨着步。我底心有着夜的寂寞，與孤獨。我是茫然的在追尋我底流浪之家。</p>
<p>忽然，我底面前有兩條黑的人影子出現了，那類似兩條鬼影擋上我的視綫。使我聽到的是一個單純的嚮音從我前邊傳過來。我被嚇得木偶一般的却仆倒在茅草叢里。我底頭開始暈沉了。我底耳朶嗡嗡地鳴着。我底眼睛塞着一團黑光。我的心是一個不平靜的海了。我呌喊。然而一個單純的嚮音又從前邊傳過來了，像一聲雷，似乎邁着我底頭頂飛遠了。</p>
<p>我喘着氣。我沒有再呌喊。我底喉嚨沙啞而困澀。我臉上流滿了汗。我伸直了胳膊。我覺得那兩條黑的人影幾乎要吞噬了我。我沒有看淸楚他們的面孔。他們的腦袋是戴着一頂深黑色的長毛的狗皮帽子。他們的身上是披了一件深黑色的而帶毛的皮大衣。他們做出射擊的姿勢來，每人手里却握有一隻小的手槍：「朋友！我們等你好久了……」我的牙齒打着抖。我用充滿了哀告的聲調，急切的說：</p>
<p>「…呵，呵…朋友，我，我，我和你們一樣呀…生活把我驅逐到這山野里…我沒有錢。我只有我底不安的靈魂，和我底身上的搏鬥的筋肉…再，再，還有給我以溫暖的迄唯一的小行李捲了。而且，在我這小行李捲里還包藏着兩片乾乾的包米餅子。朋友，假若你們飢餓了，我可以情願給你們吃…假若，假若你們不肯相信我的話是一片實話，那麼，不妨你們就在我身上搜搜看……」</p>
<p>我沒有再往下說。我默默地面對着他們。我看他們的形相，似乎是被我的話有所戚動了。他們彼此會意了一回，有一個搖了搖頭，做出傷心的樣子來，便敏捷地蹲在我跟前，用低沉的語調，這麼問我：「你是要往那里去，」</p>
<p>「沒有一定呵……」我悽苦地。</p>
<p>「是從什麼地方來的？」</p>
<p>「庫克多博·」</p>
<p>「家呢？」</p>
<p>那里有家！家被燬在九一八的烽火里！我被我們的敵人從家鄉驅逐出來，於是東奔西走……」</p>
<p>（記憶的鎖鑰又被我拉開了：我彷彿又重回到我那地獄似的家鄉去了）。</p>
<p>我迷朦。我悲哀。</p>
<p>在我面前這兩個「靑年路刧者」，（我居然這樣稱呼他們。）沉悶的，竟有好些時刻沒說出一句話來。他們用憂鬱的眼睛凝視着我底面孔。（夜是黑的，我底面孔也是黑的。）於是，那個和我談話的人，便說：「朋友，那麼我們一道去找宿吧。」</p>
<p>我沒有立刻回答他。我膽怯而且退縮：我担心我這一件破舊的大衣，我更担心我這唯一的小行李捲呀。最後，我却躊躇地，囁嚅着：唔……」</p>
<p>他爽直的說：唔什麼，你不要懷疑我們呀……」沉思了一回，他又：「見了面就是朋友。假若你認爲可以和我們做朋友的話，今後，我們不妨在一起生活呢。我們都是靑年……」</p>
<p>遝沒等他說完，他底同伴上前拍着我底肩頭，挿上嘴：</p>
<p>「在兩個月以前，我們並沒有想到會在這山野里度着流浪的生涯。我們都一是曾經受過大學敎育的靑年。自從離開一學校，我們就跑到火綫上，在中東沿綫參加我們的抗　工作，那知戰事利，不幸我們一小隊人全被敵人繳了械。這樣我們都做了敵人的俘虜了！受了兩天的覊押，我們終於有三個人得以新生了。在逃脫的路上，沒有幾天，我們三個人之中有一個因負傷過重，却在一個秋雨連綿的深夜里，亡命在一個破落的小的市鎭上。從此，我們失掉了一個勇猛的戰友之後，爲了生活，我們也離開那個小的市鎭了，却開始在這山野里面奔波。我們每天走着路。我們也每天把身子隱藏在路旁的森林里。我們用着機警的耳朵去聽路上的聲音。因此，我們底心也漸漸的悲哀了。我們的思想像被蒙着一面黑網。對於自己的冐失的舉動，却深深地戚到了一種窘迫與絕望。所以，我們往往要怯然的從森林里探出頭來，目送着那走遠的人的背影。記得有一次，我們遇到一個强悍的過路商人，那直讓我們陷於惶惑了！結果，我們每人却被那傢伙重重實實的在腿上打了一棍子，他逃了……」</p>
<p>我不由得發急的問：「那麼，你爲什不放槍把他打倒？」</p>
<p>他苦笑了一下，便吞吐的說：「槍哼……我們自從吃了那傢伙的虧，我們的腿一連痛了十幾天不敢邁步……」</p>
<p>這樣，我們便上路走了。我也不再膽怯而且退縮了。山野死寂得猶如一個墳墓。夜是靜的，山路是靜的，好像我們底心也是靜的。走着，走着，靠近在我右邊一個，他用手輕輕的拍動着我的肩膀，笑聲的，悄悄說：「你不是在問爲什麼不放槍嗎？你瞧，這玩藝那會打倒人呢！」說着，便把槍從腰袋里掏出來，搖搖擺擺的呌我瞧。</p>
<p>我驚奇的從他手里把那隻手槍接過來，我這才知道他的手槍確實不是一雙眞的呵，這正是玩具店里很流行的專給兒童們預備的小玩物：只能放響而不能打人。這時，我不禁在心里暗暗的發笑了：呵，這眞是兩個够滑稽的傢伙。</p>
<p>他用手抓着我底肩膀頭，嘴里哼着歌曲；一邊興奮的：「你，你，你不要瞧不起這玩藝，你知道在這徬徨的飢餓的路上，它就是我們唯一的救星……」　　月亮高高地上升了。四野里流着一片澄淸的白光。</p>
<p>我沒有孤獨。我多了兩個朋友，</p>
<p>夜深，我和我底朋友宿在諾爾扎克村落里。</p>
<h3 id="c198">鴿子 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>偶然間，有一對瓦灰色的鴿子從我們對面屋脊上飛過，打了一個旋廻，便落在那洋臺的水泥闌干邊停住了。牠們四週回顧着，頗悠閑地在上面開始踱起方步，修起翅膀來。</p>
<p>我倚着窗子凝視那一對可愛的影子，在我眼前活潑地躍跳着，自家兒的心裏，也就浮起了數年以前的一幕往事—　　在從前，自己對於這些小生物原也並不生疏；那時我們還在故鄉的時候，古老的大夫第——我們的舊宅——裏曾經養過三筒鴿子。祖父，便是很愛養這些東西的人，他空來總在弄鴿子玩的，並且時常小心地替牠們換窠，加水更籠：遇到天花時期，更一點不怠慢的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>給牠們串起菉豆來。</p>
<p>我們的蕉宅左右有兩個長方形的小天井，左邊有一株高齊屋脊寶珠川茶花，右面也同樣植着一株玉蘭花樹，裏進就是我們的臥房。自從養了鴿子之後，那兩個小天井裏便裝了兩雙鴿籠，每籠裏有二十四個格子，但實際祗住着十六對鴿子，還有空餘的八格，據祖父說是預備牠們帶了陌生鴿子來居住的。</p>
<p>因為在這些鴿子中間，有時也有一兩雙飛去了不回來的，可是總隔不了幾天又見牠們怱怱地飛回來了；而且，也有甚至還帶來了一兩頭新的夥伴。因此，祖父曾經告訴我：</p>
<p>「這些有靈性的小動物，牠們也知道戀家的，可是當牠們的主人家運衰敗的時候，牠們去了就不再會回來了：所以有句古話，呌「薄鴿子往旺處飛！」</p>
<p>我們小時候，那些鴿子差不多成了我們童年的唯一伴侶，在清晨，或黃昏，聽到那咕咕的聲音，會使我們感到喜悅，感到十分親切的。</p>
<p>站在附近的山坡上，便可遙遠地望到我家屋頂上那面紅色小旗，在臨風飄揚着。這據說是一種標記，免得鴿子們飛出去了，回來找尋不到牠們的老家。</p>
<p>我們高興的是雁來時節的春天，因為那時可以放鴿鈴了。祖父是預先做好了許多竹哨子；在早晨的陽光下，把那竹哨子一支一支地用紅絲綫拴好了，繫在鴿子的脚趾间。我们在现在回想到當時記憶裏的印像，覺得祖父並不像是一位五十多歲的老人，而却和我們差不多地孩氣的。</p>
<p>到天高氣爽，春風和暖的當兒，我們不時會在山野中，或深谷裏，聽到天空中那宏亮悅耳的音樂，會引起人們一種輕快與荒涼之感！——這就是那些鴿子在迎風飛翔，使哨裏灌進了風而發出的聲音。</p>
<p>這樣過了幾年，祖父是在一年的秋天去世了；父親也是一個在外度着飄泊生涯的人，那些鴿子也就漸漸地沒有人去管理了。雖然我們愛鴿子，可是那時我已被送進了一家私塾裏去騐書，已經沒有餘閑去玩弄牠們，而且日子久了，那些陶氣的小東西的影子也漸漸地在我心裏消失了。</p>
<p>大約又過了一年光景，父親接着也去世了，於是母亲为了窮得沒有辦法的原故，便將那三筒——其實這時只剩了兩筒，一筒是在祖父死的時候逃走的——鴿子賣給了三叔。</p>
<p>那故事離開現在已快二十年了，這二十年來自己就在異鄕的十字街頭流浪着；為了生活，為了負擔，在那悠長的時日裏，就絕不會讓自家有一刻餘閑來想這些隔得很遠的往事，雖則那此故事在自己記憶裏還佔着一個地位，然而也只有偶然一閃，不會使了傷逝了二十年的童年重現了。</p>

<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>晶子看看小窗口雙重鐵絲綱里的爸爸，覺得不像夏天在老家那樣子了。頭髪長長的，兩隻眼睛凹下去還大得很，鬍髭毛茸茸的圍着嘴吧，晶子看出爸爸瘦了，像生过病，可是爸爸正使手搔着垂下来的頭髪笑着说：</p>
<p>「晶子，奶想爸没有？」</p>
<p>晶子轉着光光的小眼睛，記得奶奶在家哭過好多遍，媽帶着晶子離開家，坐了兩天轟龍的火車，昨天夜里穿過幾條亮閃閃的街，在一個滿是生人的院子里住下。早上出門的時候，媽還囑咐過：不準告訴爸奶奶常哭，這時便很懂事的扭着頭髪蓬鬆的小腦袋，看看站在身邊的媽，再看看讓鐵絲綱遮住在的爸爸的瘦臉，媽勉强的笑了笑，拍着晶子的的頭說：</p>
<p>「告訴爸爸呀，」</p>
<p>她小小的心里忽的想起奶奶淌着涙水常说的那句話來：</p>
<p>「奶呌爸快點家去」。</p>
<p>爸爸微微的笑了，過後便寗靜的望着用額抵着窗框的媽媽的臉，媽媽不言語，眼圈慢慢紅了，鼻子發悶的噓着氣，過一陣涙珠一串串掉下來。晶子知道媽在難過着，便喊着媽，自已悄悄的哭了。往常在家，爸爸從外面回來，就要抱抱晶子，或吻吻她紅潤的小腮，問一聲：</p>
<p>「晶子淘氣不？」</p>
<p>她必定答聲「不」，或「晶子是　孩子，不淘氣。」爸爸便從懹里掏出糖菓來塞進她胖胖的小手里，可是現在爸像生着病，在這麼隻老鼠籠子關着，晶子一顆小小的心罩了層陰鬰的暗影，就哇地聲裂了小嘴哭出來，喊着</p>
<p>「媽媽，我們跟爸爸家去，」（未完）</p>

<p>一分才調一分情。誰是無情誰有情。佳人無不憐才子。才子亦然愛佳人。但有一端堪恨處。情長情短不均勻。也有。平日有情難見面。也有。素來無意却相親。也有。始而　之終而棄。也有。先成吳于越後成婚。不是人心分厚薄。祇緣才淺與才深。豈是變端今日起。從前不少過來人。可敬的。宋弘不放精糖婦。可愛的·樂昌抱鏡未重婚。可忌的·李益無情　舊好。可惡的。王魁有意背前盟。夢到柳邊皆可親。詩題葉上也成婚。可笑世人迷不悟。竊玉偷香當正經。露水夫妻認了眞。爭風吸酷成何用。陡惹風波不太平。可笑·不解風流兩個字。自誇才子與佳人。豈非反被風流誤。陽台不是風流亭。便作風流豈在眞。然而。多情不是風流事。縱使風流淡幾分。奉勸風流才子輩。絕無才調絕無情。風流强作多情解。便是風流罪過人。得陰情處且陶情。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The National Government Holds Second Anniversary Commemoration of the New Life Movement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Ji Represented the Chairman in Leading the Ceremony</p>
<p>Various Circles in the Capital Met at the Lixing Society</p>
<p>President Chiang and Chairman Lin Gave Admonitory Speeches</p>
<p>Celebrations Held Separately Throughout the Country</p>
<p>Nanjing. This morning at 9:00 AM, the National Government held a commemoration of the second anniversary of the New Life Movement. All officials of the government attended. Zhang Ji represented the chairman and led the ceremony. He then gave an impromptu report, advocating that the New Life Movement should actively promote the significance of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. He generally stated that political power is vertical, from top to bottom, while the New Life Movement advocates propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, advocating starting from everyone's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. It is a horizontal force that spreads to the masses. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are inherent virtues of our country, which have gradually been lost. These virtues should be actively promoted by the government, especially those in high positions should lead by example. This is the new force of our revolution, training the unity of the people, promoting the people, improving the people's intelligence, and improving the people's lives, so that the power of the broad masses of people can be united into the power of the entire country. This is the important meaning of promoting the New Life Movement. At 9:45 AM, the speech ended and the ceremony concluded. Various agencies in the capital also held commemorations of the second anniversary of the New Life Movement this morning, with the heads of the respective agencies reporting on the significance of promoting the New Life Movement. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. This morning at 9:00 AM, various circles in the capital held a commemoration of the second anniversary of the New Life Movement in the simple and tidy auditorium of the Lixing Society. Those present included Chairman Yan and his wife, Chairman Lin, Feng Yuxiang, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Ju Zheng, Qin Zhen, Shao Yuanchong, Shi Ying, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Wei Huai, Weng Wenhao, Ma Chaojun, Jiao Yitang, Chen Bulei, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Hua, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Zhizhong, Xu Tingyao, Gu Zhenglun, Wang Gupan, Yang Jie, He Zhonghan, Wang Shufang, Yu Yeqiu, and more than a thousand representatives from various circles. After President Chiang led the ceremony, Chairman Ma Chaojun gave an opening speech. President Chiang, Chairman Lin, and Central Representative Ye Chucang gave admonitory speeches in succession. Feng Yuxiang delivered a speech. At 11:30 AM, the meeting concluded with the shouting of slogans in a solemn atmosphere. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. President Chiang's admonitory speech at the capital's second anniversary commemoration of the New Life Movement briefly stated that after China promoted the New Life Movement, the whole world knew about it, but the actual effect in the past two years has been very small, which is really shameful. The meaning of the New Life Movement is what the ancients called, "All things before are as if dead yesterday, all things after are as if born today." Practicing the New Life should be constantly seeking newness and progress at every moment, and must check everything every day, striving for perfection, and seeking truth from facts. Those present today are all leaders from various circles, and should lead by example and follow the New Life, so that subordinates or students will know to follow suit. If this can be done, then establishing a new country will not be difficult. Furthermore, the New Life Movement, in addition to reforming clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and practicing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, should also have a spirit of universal love and mutual assistance, and so on. Chairman Lin's admonitory speech briefly stated that promoting the New Life Movement is to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. Its purpose is to seek a good life for everyone, and to achieve the strength of the nation and the people. To implement the New Life, we must use three methods: mutual encouragement, gradual influence, and punishment, and so on. Ye Chucang's admonitory speech briefly stated that the promotion of the New Life Movement, in addition to edification, is also related to political power. There were two sages in Chinese history, King Wen and Confucius. King Wen had great power of edification, and his virtues spread everywhere in a few years. Confucius initially encountered obstacles everywhere, until he served as the Grand Minister of Justice in Lu, and Lu was well governed in less than three months. The reason for this is entirely related to the assistance of political power. Those present today are all leaders from various circles, and there are no less than three or four hundred Grand Ministers of Justice. If they still cannot promote the New Life Movement and edify the people, then they will be letting down the Party and the country. The implementation of the New Life Movement should not use political power for harsh and detailed interference, but should be rewarded with wise rewards. Being able to reward one good deed can make hundreds or thousands of people do good deeds. Conversely, those who should not be rewarded are also rewarded, and the harm is infinite. Feng Yuxiang's speech briefly stated that the productivity of our people is very weak, and the methods of production used are still the methods of two thousand years ago, but in terms of consumption, they imitate foreign managers and diplomats everywhere. How can the country not be poor and weak? Taking Commander Chiang, the advocate of the New Life Movement, as an example, he only has two suits of clothes, one is a Zhongshan suit and the other is a military uniform. His food is also very simple, with only one dish of fish, one bowl of vegetables and white rice, and one dish of dim sum when entertaining guests. However, the general public is extravagant, wasteful, and dissolute, and must be drastically changed. Furthermore, the New Life is a life of saving the nation and preserving its existence. From today onwards, everyone must work hard to practice it. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Nanjing. Ma Chaojun's opening speech at the second anniversary commemoration of the New Life Movement briefly stated that since Mr. Chiang first delivered a speech on the New Life Movement in Nanchang two years ago, the promotion of the New Life Movement has been surging throughout the country. In the past two years, the New Life Movement in the capital has achieved many results due to the consistent leadership by example of leaders from all walks of life and the efforts of the general labor service corps. Today, we are holding a commemoration meeting. The first thing is to cleanse our hearts and listen to the words of Mr. Chiang and the central government officials. This is the meaning of respecting and obeying the leaders. The second is to implement the various methods of the New Life Movement in the capital and the New Life Movement. Implementing the methods of the New Life is to obey the organization. Only by respecting the leaders and obeying the organization can China be saved and the nation be revived.

<p>One Should Awaken to the Idea of "Yesterday Dead, Today Born" and Seek Truth from Facts</p>
<p>Use Personal Example and Energy to Edify the Masses</p>
<p>Nanjing. The following is the full text of President Chiang's admonitory speech at the New Life Movement Commemoration on the 19th: Chairman, distinguished representatives, comrades, today is the second anniversary of the New Life Movement. As I attend this commemoration ceremony, I feel very ashamed in my heart. Because the name of the "New Life Movement" has spread far and wide in the past two years. Now, no matter where you go, everyone knows that China is promoting a "New Life Movement." However, how much real effect has the New Life Movement had? After our own inspection, we know that our progress is very small. Although it has been two years, we have not achieved our expected goals. I am the initiator of the New Life Movement. In many places, I have not done my best, and perhaps I have not been able to lead by example to influence and transform society. As a result, the New Life Movement has not been promoted quickly, and the results are not as expected, which has failed the earnest expectations of those at home and abroad. I am truly ashamed. However, the past is already in the past. The most important thing is to hope that the New Life Movement can make special progress from today's second anniversary onwards and achieve final success quickly. How can we achieve this goal? Of course, we must rely on the leaders of various circles who are responsible for leadership, as well as all intellectuals, to take responsibility and work together to promote it. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity today to first tell you the key points of promoting the New Life Movement. First, we must have the determination of "Yesterday Dead, Today Born." Everyone knows that the opposite of the "new" in the so-called "New Life Movement" is the "old," and the opposite of "life" is "death." The New Life Movement, as the name suggests, is a life revolution movement to "remove the old and establish the new" and to "revive the dead." There are two ancient Chinese sayings that are most appropriate to describe the current New Life Movement. These two sentences are: "All things before are as if dead yesterday, all things after are as if born today." We must eliminate all the bad and corrupt things in each individual and even the entire society and country, in other words, the old thoughts, actions, habits, and customs, and create good, civilized new thoughts and actions, that is, new habits and customs. Then we can build a modern country. Now people criticize our country as a backward country, or say that it is a non-modern country. What does it mean to be "non-modern?" To put it nicely, it is "backward," which means that we cannot keep pace with others. To put it bluntly, it is "corrupt," which is "barbaric." In other words, it means the life of the past. If we want to put it more civilly, it is a "dead" life, or a "non-human" life. How can we say it is a dead life? Let me go further. In general, any life that is not artistic and not productive is a dead life. To be honest, the life of our Chinese people is a "non-human" life, or a "dead person's" life, not a new life, nor a modern life. The purpose of our New Life now is to turn a non-human life that does not know propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame into a "human" life that knows propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and to turn a corrupt, dirty, and dead life of prostitution, gambling, and opium into a modern "living" life. In this way, we can keep pace with modern people and modern countries. To achieve this step, the most fundamental point is that everyone must first have a determination: "All things before are as if dead yesterday, all things after are as if born today." We must have this kind of awareness of "Yesterday Dead, Today Born" before we can practice the New Life and promote the New Life Movement. Originally, no matter who it is, there are wrong things happening every day, and bad habits are inevitable. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for the entire society and country. Therefore, we must constantly work hard to reflect on ourselves, check our own mistakes, discover our own shortcomings, and constantly strive to correct all the mistakes and remedy all the shortcomings, and continue to make progress. In this way, we can "renew ourselves day after day," succeed as a new person, and establish a new society and a new country, which can be considered as truly practicing the New Life and promoting the New Life Movement. Today, all the comrades who are attending the meeting are leaders of various circles and are in charge of a part of the work. Everyone can reflect on whether we can always check ourselves and the agencies, schools, and groups under our charge, as well as our families, and whether we have been working hard to improve ourselves in the spirit of "Yesterday Dead, Today Born." As far as I can see, I am afraid that very little has been done. It is precisely because we ourselves do not strictly check and reflect that we cannot discover our own mistakes, our own corrupt and barbaric lives. Since a person does not know his own shortcomings, he will certainly not know the weaknesses of society and the country. Naturally, there will be no spirit of "Yesterday Dead, Today Born" to thoroughly change. In this way, there will never be progress. Such a people, such a nation, will certainly be subjected to the humiliation and oppression of others, and even national subjugation. Today, I must first tell you about this dangerous phenomenon. As long as you do not want to be a slave to a foreign country, you should reflect deeply and thoroughly, and use the determination of "Yesterday Dead, Today Born" to practice the New Life and promote the New Life Movement. Second, if we want to promote the New Life Movement, we must have the spirit of "Seeking Truth from Facts." To put it bluntly, the New Life Movement is to modernize the spirit and actions of the people of the whole country. We know that the modern era is the "era of science." The so-called "modernization" is to be "scientific," "organized," and "disciplined." In general, it is to be "militarized." The basic spirit of science is to "Seek Truth from Facts and Strive for Perfection." Specifically, it is to be "true," not allowing any hypocrisy or deception, to be "precise," not allowing any perfunctory or vague behavior, and finally to be "thorough," not allowing any procrastination, perfunctory behavior, or the bad habit of giving up halfway. From this, we can know that the meaning of our life being "scientific" and "militarized" is to completely eliminate all the past accumulated habits of hypocrisy, selfishness, vagueness, procrastination, perfunctory behavior, and all other habits that are not suitable for the modern era, and to truly practice the new life of "neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, diligence, speed, and certainty." We must have this spirit of "Seeking Truth from Facts" before we can truly promote the New Life Movement. Third, if we want to promote the New Life Movement, we must have the energy of "Leading by Example" to edify the masses. If we want to promote the New Life Movement, we must of course first be able to do it ourselves before we can gradually influence and guide our subordinates, students, children, and even all the people in society to practice the New Life. We must start from our own hearts. If we can first reform our hearts and thoroughly check and improve our own living habits to meet the requirements of the New Life, then when our subordinates, students, children, and all the people in society see us, they will naturally be influenced by us, and we will not need to supervise them one by one or persuade them family by family.

A concrete plan for the solution to the Hebei-East issue has been discussed. After the Hebei-East issue is resolved, negotiations on the Chahar-North issue will be held again.

<h3 id="e12">Hidden Worries Regarding the People's Food Problem <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The people's food problem does not seem to attract as much public attention today as it did before the new year. After the severe drought of the previous year, 12,960,000 metric tons of foreign rice were still imported. So far, the price of rice has been stable without major fluctuations. The general public considers this to be fortunate for the people's food supply, but it is actually not something to rejoice about. The price of rice, whether high or low, should be weighed in terms of production and consumption, considering the pros and cons. Low grain prices hurt farmers, while high grain prices hurt the people. Neither is a blessing for people's livelihood. Last year's autumn harvest varied from abundance to scarcity in Zhejiang Province. Jiangsu Province did not see a fully abundant harvest either. Anhui Province was worried about the lack of regulatory measures, and the Shanghai rice market was in a state of prolonged sluggishness and short-term surges. The price of new rice is closely related to the livelihood of farmers throughout the year. The current stagnant rice price is more of a reflection of rural bankruptcy than a result of abundant rice harvests. Since the decline of the countryside, farmers have lost their ability to save. As soon as new grain comes on the market, they urgently seek to exchange it for living expenses, not caring about future shortages. Landlords parasitic on farmers share the same fate as the farmers. Therefore, when new agricultural products come onto the market, there is often an oversupply. No one can come forward to take charge of regulation. The current rice price is supported by purchases from Yantai and Qingdao merchants. However, the sales routes for rice in the north have always been very limited. The current continuous purchases of thousands of bags are quite surprising. Yesterday's telegraph news in this newspaper stated that the puppet military and administrative ministry has controlled food supplies, wheat flour, and has ordered no exports to maintain the food and military needs within the puppet area. Yantai and Dalian are only separated by a narrow strip of water that a sail can reach. Could this be the leak?</p>
<p>The need for food storage and regulation is something that the Chinese people know and speak of with great emphasis. However, as time passes, they easily forget it. Occasionally, when efforts are made, they rarely succeed. A one-day burst of sunshine followed by ten days of cold will not achieve anything. In the past, the ever-normal granary was used to supply the military, and community granaries were used to prepare for famine. Later generations slightly changed the system, but opening granaries and distributing grain still benefited the people's food supply. However, the system of storing grain exists in name only. The promotion of agricultural granaries has not yet been fully beneficial. Without resources for storage, there is no preparation for disasters. This leads to low grain prices when new grain comes onto the market and no food for the people when there is a shortage. This is the situation in normal times. What will happen in times of crisis? In ancient times, there was a warning that a nation without a three-year reserve would not be a nation. Where is the three-month supply of grain now? We sit idly by as good rice flows out without thinking of remedies. When a rice shortage strikes, we will again seek help from foreign countries. Leaving aside the unbearable dangers to people's livelihood and the national economy, the losses from buying high and selling low cannot be calculated.</p>

He had discussed the Asia League with Sun Yat-sen, Hu Hanmin, Li Zongren, and others, and all felt that the Asia League was necessary. He would first meet with Hu. If Hu believed that it was necessary for him to go to Guangxi, then he would go to Guangxi. Otherwise, he would not go. There would be no expansion of the conflict between Japan and Russia due to small border issues. The China-Japan issue must ultimately be resolved through the Asia League.

<h3 id="e14">Main Tax Revenue Statistics for the 24th Year <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The National Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance manages the national consolidated tax, stamp tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, property tax, and customs and salt tax, which are the main sources of revenue for the national treasury. The various taxes collected by the administration in the 24th year have been classified and assessed, and preliminary statistics have been compiled. Excerpts of the figures are as follows. The total annual revenue was 136,381,000 yuan, an increase of 4,330,000 yuan compared to the 23rd year. This year, the flood-affected area was extremely large, and the market in various places was very depressed. Business closures were frequent. The administration's collection performance was still able to increase by more than 4.3 million yuan. Among them, the consolidated tax portion included 75,814,000 yuan in cigarette tax, 19,308,000 yuan in cotton yarn tax, 5,552,000 yuan in wheat flour tax, 8,805,000 yuan in match tax, 2,785,000 yuan in cement tax, 3,568,000 yuan in flue-cured tobacco tax, and 677,000 yuan in alcohol tax, totaling 116,509,000 yuan. The consolidated tax revenue in the 23rd year was 110,746,000 yuan. This year's increase was 5,763,000 yuan. The successive opening of consolidated tax in Sichuan, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces in July and August of this year was also a reason for part of the increase. The stamp tax revenue was 7,715,000 yuan (excluding the number of stamps sold by the post office in Guangdong Province). The revenue in the 23rd year was 7,490,000 yuan, an increase of 225,000 yuan. This year, there were also cases of exchanging old stamps for new stamps, which affected tax revenue. Therefore, the actual increase was more than this. In the future, this tax is expected to improve daily. The tobacco and alcohol tax (in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces) totaled 9,672,000 yuan. The revenue in the 23rd year was 11,055,000 yuan. Due to natural disasters and banditry, there was a shortfall of 1,383,000 yuan this year. The mineral tax totaled 2,485,000 yuan. The revenue in the 23rd year was 2,760,000 yuan. For the same reasons, there was a shortfall of 275,000 yuan this year. The tax surplus and deficit statistics still show an increase as above.

<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official sources here, Japan will demand that Soviet Russia immediately extradite the rebel soldiers of "Manchukuo" who rebelled in Mishan on January 29 and fled into Russian territory after fighting with the Japanese-Manchu forces at Jinjiagou. The "Manchu" government recently made the same request to the Russian Consul-General in Harbin, who promised to forward it to Moscow, but has not yet received a reply. Since the repeated border clashes and the tense situation, senior officials of the Japanese Army Ministry and the Foreign Ministry have been holding meetings almost every day. It is heard that the two ministries have decided to seek peaceful solutions to the border incidents. Yesterday's cabinet meeting also held this view, but felt that the intrusion of Russian soldiers into "Manchu" territory at Jinjiagou was extremely arrogant. According to the communique released in Changchun on February 1, a Russian soldier's body and a Russian-made gas mask were found among the corpses of the rebels at Jinjiagou. The "Manchu" authorities also said that Russian soldiers infiltrated "Manchu" territory to incite the Mishan rebellion. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Ambassador Ota stationed in Russia met with Director-General Smaniyakov of the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the 14th to protest the Red Army's border crossing incident in Jinjiagou and proposed the establishment of a joint Japan-Manchukuo-Soviet Union committee, saying that the border line in the mountainous area in the eastern part of the Manchuria-Russia border was unclear and that there were traces of illegal movement of border markers. Japan, Manchukuo, and Russia should quickly establish an investigation committee to determine the border line. The Soviet government, in the past China-Russia Treaty and Russia-Fengtian Treaty, expressed its agreement to determine the border line in the area. It deliberately expressed its agreement to Japan's proposal and removed the root of border disputes. However, the Director-General of the Soviet Foreign Ministry replied to this proposal that there was no place where the border was unclear and that the border crossing incident was unrelated to the border line and was caused by Japan's and Manchukuo's active policies.

The fundamental policy of the Japanese government towards the Soviet Union is to resolve pending issues as the top priority, thereby seeking to resolve the eastern border issue and the Jinjiagou incident. If the Soviet government agrees to a joint field investigation committee and recognizes the establishment of an eastern border demarcation committee, then the pending issues can be resolved, and we believe that relations between the two countries can be gradually improved.

<p>Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun said that on the eve of the general election, the opposition Seiyukai is still ahead in the campaign, but the government party, the Minseito, is not showing weakness. The main issue in this election that the people should support is the policy of controlled currency inflation advocated by Finance Minister Takahashi or the policy of unrestricted currency inflation advocated by the Seiyukai. Although this election has the slogan of a clean election, as of 5 pm yesterday, there have been 714 cases of irregular activities involving 1,816 people. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e27">After a Victory in the East African War, Anxiously Seeking to Reverse the Declining Trend in Central Europe; Hoping to Draw Closer to Germany by Replicating the Old Tactic of Countering Russia, Aiming to Maintain Influence in the Danube River Region and Preserve Austria's Independence <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Rome, special dispatch from our correspondent: The Italian authorities intend to take advantage of their military victory against the Abyssinians to consolidate their diplomatic front. The Deputy Foreign Minister, Suvich, after meeting with the German Ambassador to Italy, Hassel, yesterday, is scheduled to meet with the Austrian Foreign Minister, Weidegger, in Florence today to discuss various pending issues, particularly the Danube River Pact. It is reported that Suvich will explain to Weidegger that if the Danube River issue is resolved under Soviet guidance, the danger would be significant. As for the rapprochement between Italy and Germany, it will not hinder Austrian independence in any way, as Italy has no intention of abandoning its stance on guaranteeing Austrian independence. Its rapprochement with Germany is based on the promise provided by the German leader, Hitler, regarding Austrian independence. Suvich will also express that although Italy is currently engaged in East Africa, its strength in Europe remains strong, and its commitment to the Stresa Front and the Locarno Treaty will depend on the attitude of Britain and France towards Italy, thus giving Italy more flexibility in dealing with Britain and France. In short, the rapprochement between Italy and Germany is intended to establish a better understanding without affecting future relations with Britain and France. The reason for not wanting to make demands on the redistribution of mandated territories is to show respect for the existing interests of Britain and France. Furthermore, the movement towards rapprochement between Italy and Germany began as early as September of last year, when Italian newspapers expressed their approval of German policies, especially Germany's views on the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact, the Locarno Pact, and Germany's rearmament. German newspapers also expressed sympathy for Italy's military action in Abyssinia. The two sides were already very harmonious in sentiment. In addition, Italy is determined to maintain its original influence in the Danube River region and opposes the Soviet Union's control of the Danube River region. This, along with Germany's rejection of the Soviet Union, is actually converging on the same path. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome: Since the outbreak of the war, special expenditures from various departments have been urgently needed. The Ministry of Finance has recently decided to increase the funding for the following departments: 40 million lire for the Colonial Department, 500 million lire for the Army Department, 200 million lire for the Navy Department, 350 million lire for the Air Force Department, and 80 million lire for the Ministry of Interior. The last item is specifically for supporting the families of soldiers on expeditions. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Frequent Contacts Between Italy and Germany; German Ambassador Returns Home Again After Resuming His Post</p>
<p>Rome: The German Ambassador to Italy, Hassel, was summoned back to his country in the middle of last week to meet with the German leader, Hitler, in Munich, and then immediately returned to his post. After holding talks with the Italian Deputy Foreign Minister, Suvich, yesterday, Hassel departed again for his country this morning. It is generally believed that the nature of the talks between Germany and Italy is extremely important. The diplomatic policy of Germany has now clearly undergone a change. Recently, the heads of German diplomatic missions abroad have been successively recalled by the leader, Hitler, for consultation. The purpose is to ascertain how Germany can utilize the European situation caused by the Italo-Abyssinian conflict and how Germany's current actions can benefit Italy. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Berlin: It is reported that the Czech Prime Minister, Hodza, has drafted an economic reorganization plan for the countries of the Danube River region, excluding Germany from the Danube River region.

<p>Warsaw: German Aviation Minister General Göring arrived here this morning. According to our correspondent, Göring's visit may have a significant political impact on the general relations between Poland and Germany. However, it is feared that the current economic disputes between the two countries will not be easily resolved. Among them, the issue of German trains passing through the Danzig Corridor and the debts owed to Poland remains unresolved. Regarding various pending economic issues, the German government originally entrusted the German Minister of Economics, Schacht, to resolve them, and General Göring may not discuss them.

<p>Warsaw: Recently, Germany intends to improve relations with the Soviet Union and Lithuania, causing anxiety in Poland.

Both sides have hidden intentions.

<h3 id="e30">British Company Releases Last Year's Silver Market Annual Report; Three Major Changes in Finance <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London: The British company, Montagu &amp; Co., today released its annual report on the silver market, stating that there were three major changes in the financial sector in 1935: the instability of the United States' silver policy, Mexico's abandonment of the silver standard, and China's de facto abandonment of silver. Although the United States purchased a total of 544,000,000 ounces of silver last year, its silver reserves are still far from the 1:3 ratio of silver to gold, because the United States' gold reserves have greatly increased. The world's new silver mine output in 1935 was a total of 206,000,000 ounces, an increase of 21,000,000 ounces compared to the output in 1934, and the supply of silver from other sources in 1935 was 145,000,000 ounces. The main factor in the silver market in the future will of course still be the US Treasury Department. The policies that the US Treasury Department will implement have not yet been indicated. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently stated that the US monetary policy is based on a 24-hour foundation, which makes it difficult to grasp. India has recently shown signs of increasing its silver purchases. The restoration of the silver standard in China is unlikely for the time being, and China will continue to sell silver as a way to maintain currency exchange rates. Therefore, the silver market can only rely on one buyer. If this buyer suddenly changes its policy, it will inevitably have a disruptive impact on banks and will require some time to adjust to the new situation. Therefore, as long as the US Treasury Department's measures are not clear, the future of the silver market remains uncertain, and it is practically impossible to predict the future trend of silver prices.

<p>Madrid: Valladares, the leader of the Liberal Party, who took office on December 30, has resigned as Prime Minister today. Azaña, the former Prime Minister and Army Minister, has reportedly agreed to form a new cabinet. Azaña, 56, is the leader of the United Republican Party. When he served as Prime Minister between 1932 and 1933, he granted women the right to vote. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The cabinet held a State Council meeting at the Presidential Palace at 1:35 PM today, and then announced its collective resignation at 2:30 PM. Beforehand, Prime Minister Valladares made a statement to reporters, saying, "The cabinet members respect the spirit of democracy and the will of the people, and have decided to step aside." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Barrio, the leader of the Republican Union, stated today that the government has decided to resign, and Azaña may succeed in forming a moderate left-wing cabinet. It is said that before the general election, the left-wing parties and the Republican factions reached an agreement that no matter how the left-wing wins, the power will still be controlled by the Republican factions. Therefore, although the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and Syndicalist Party occupy a majority in the Congress, they may not be included in the new cabinet. At the same time, military leaders are also holding secret meetings. (National News dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The situation deteriorated last night, and some military leaders planned to seize power, but an army colonel, unwilling to participate in the coup, informed the authorities. The authorities immediately dispatched the militia and took preemptive action before the plot could unfold, arresting two senior military officers. One of them is reportedly General Goded, the Army Inspector General. The London Daily News' Madrid dispatch stated that the purpose of this coup was to restore the monarchy through a dictatorship. If the plot succeeds, the deposed King Alfonso, who was forced to abdicate in 1931, will soon return to Spain. To establish a dictatorship, fascist and royalist officers in the army have formed a secret organization called the Spanish Military Union. Inspections are now very strict, and newspapers are not allowed to publish news of the coup. The general public is still unaware of this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Today, the police, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party are all engaged in general mobilization. The public is paying close attention to this, fearing that disturbances may occur at any time. After the Police Commissioner hurriedly returned to the capital from Zaragoza, he immediately summoned all police chiefs to headquarters and ordered them to implement general mobilization. At the same time, the headquarters of the "Left-Wing People's Front Party," the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party are also implementing general mobilization, and many party members are carrying weapons.

<p>London: The League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Eighteen will meet in Geneva next month to discuss the issue of an oil embargo against Italy. The British government has appointed Foreign Secretary Eden to attend the committee. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Geneva: Regarding the date of the meeting of the League of Nations Assembly's Committee of Eighteen, according to our correspondent, the chairman of the committee, the Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, and the French Foreign Minister Flandin, both advocate convening on March 9. The British Foreign Office advocates convening on March 2. League of Nations officials also agree with March 9 for two reasons: the League of Nations' new building has been completed, but the interior has not yet been fully furnished; and there are other committees that are scheduled to meet on March 2, creating a conflict in time. As for the oil sanctions, League of Nations officials believe that even if the United States cannot participate, they must be implemented for three reasons: First, the results of the expert committee's research on the oil embargo are sufficient to prove that after the League of Nations member states implement the oil embargo, Italy will find it more difficult to obtain supplies and its expenditures will increase. Second, after the member states implement financial sanctions against Italy, even if Italy purchases oil from non-member states, its burden will inevitably increase. Third, if the representatives of the countries belonging to the Committee of Eighteen have unanimous opinions and firm attitudes, it is expected that the United States will not completely stand aside. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Lord Stanhope, in response to Lord Phillimore's question during a debate on foreign policy in the Upper House today, stated that he has taken steps to promote a peaceful resolution to the Italo-Abyssinian War, saying that he has not yet received any requests from the Italian or Abyssinian sides to consider peace talks. The British government and other League of Nations member states are not prepared to put forward new proposals for reconciliation. Today, Lord Buxton first spoke, supporting actions to promote a peaceful resolution, saying that this could consolidate the collective peace system and end Abyssinia's slavery and slave trade with international assistance. Next, Lord Cecil spoke, urging the government to pursue a resolute and unified policy. Lords Lloyd, Mansfield, and Mottistone then spoke in succession, criticizing the League of Nations' policy of imposing sanctions on Italy for resorting to force. Lord Ponsonby supported the previous three with his peace proposals, but Lord Strabolgi and other Labor peers expressed dissent to Ponsonby's views. Lord Davies spoke, saying that if the government's policy is accepted by public opinion supporting the League of Nations, then it should focus on seeking a peaceful resolution to the dispute in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations Covenant. After the speeches, Foreign Secretary Lord Stanhope gave the above-mentioned response on behalf of the government, saying that making peace proposals to Italy now would only encourage Italy to hope for better terms. If proposals that encourage Italy to continue the war are put forward, it will not be conducive to peace. At one point, sanctions against Italy did agitate the Italians, almost unanimously supporting Mussolini, but today the situation is different. Increasing the pressure of sanctions is now having an effect. Although sanctions have shown the world that a war of aggression is not worth the cost, it is not yet possible to say that this has been achieved, but he is very optimistic and believes that the League of Nations will demonstrate its ability to succeed. Currently, all League of Nations member states, except for three, have persisted in implementing the sanctions. The British government does not want to take unilateral action on this dispute. As for an oil embargo against Italy, the British government does not want to express any opinion before the League of Nations fully discusses the matter. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Washington: The Senate today passed the bill to extend the validity of the current Neutrality Act to May 1, 1937. This bill has been passed by the House of Representatives and has now been sent to the White House for President Roosevelt's signature. The two points of the current Neutrality Act that have been amended are as follows: a complete ban on belligerent countries borrowing from the United States; and countries in the Americas are not bound by the Act. (National News dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Senate today passed an amendment to the bill to extend the US Neutrality Act to May 1, 1927, advocating that the export of military equipment should not exceed peacetime levels, but there was a great outcry against it in the whole house, so this amendment was not even put to a vote and was dropped. Someone also moved to amend it to allow the president to have the right to deny government protection to American ships in war zones and to hold American citizens responsible for trading with belligerent countries, but these were all rejected by the Senate. It has been learned that this Neutrality Act was previously passed by the House of Representatives. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>New York: US Secretary of War Dern, in a speech at a dinner party at the New York Happy Association tonight, said that a Neutrality Act alone is not enough to prevent war.

<p>London: The French Chief Delegate to the Naval Conference, Ambassador Corbin, returned to his country a few days ago to report to the government on the situation at the Naval Conference. Yesterday, the French Minister of the Navy, Pietri, convened a meeting to discuss the matter. According to reports in Parisian newspapers, France may ultimately accept 35,000 tons as the tonnage of battleships, but only for a period of five years, after which it must be reduced. (Note: Britain originally advocated that future treaties should stipulate general qualitative restrictions and a system for exchanging shipbuilding information, and that their validity should be ten years.) The British side does not object to this view. What is unknown is what the US attitude will be. Naval circles here believe that the work of the Naval Conference cannot be seriously progressed until the United States has given its reply. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: The French Ambassador to the United States, de Laboulaye, and the Undersecretary of State, Phillips, met at the State Department yesterday afternoon to discuss the tonnage of battleships at the Naval Conference and the invitation to Germany to participate in future agreements. Afterwards, de Laboulaye was unwilling to comment on the details of the talks. However, according to our correspondent, the United States insists on its original position that battleships should be limited to 35,000 tons. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: The Naval Conference has now entered its final stage. An American lawyer has arrived to assist in drafting the treaty. The instructions sent by France today have clarified the situation, as the issue of battleship tonnage, which was previously an obstacle to a comprehensive compromise, has now reportedly been shelved by these instructions. The French Ambassador to Britain is currently making a final effort to persuade the United States to reduce its 35,000-ton figure, but if the US government insists on not agreeing, France will abandon its claim that battleships should be limited to 37,000 tons. The next two weeks will be devoted to the work of sorting out the wording of the treaty, and then the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and the United States will nod their heads and recognize it as a kind of pre-determined book, but it will not come into effect until Japan, Germany, and Russia have signed it. Russia will be invited to sign this autumn, but will not be invited to participate in the conference. France is very willing to have a separate agreement restricting air forces outside the naval treaty, and the establishment of a mutual assistance pact in the skies between the Locarno countries to supplement it.

<p>Paris – Mrs. Tai Puyi Xu, a political reporter for the "Wodair" newspaper in Paris, published an article today predicting that a world war will break out in Europe in the summer of 1937, or possibly even earlier. She believes that the countries involved at the outbreak of war will include Germany, France, Japan, Soviet Russia, Holland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Romania, and that other countries will certainly join later. Mrs. Xu further states that, according to military strategists, Germany will launch a surprise attack on Holland and Romania. At the same time, Japan in the Far East will launch an offensive against Soviet Russia in support. The German troops attacking Holland can be divided into three main forces. The first force will cross the Maas River and advance towards Calais. The second force, taking advantage of Holland's incomplete mobilization, will use swift and decisive means to destroy all its defensive actions. The third force will cross the Dutch border with armored vehicles and tanks, aiming for the Zuiderzee to cut off communication between the north and south of Holland and isolate its northern region. Therefore, the German army can occupy the entire territory of Holland in just a few hours. From there, they can then attack Belgium, seize the ports on the North Sea, and use submarines to cut off communication between England and France. As for the Eastern Front, Poland may join forces with Germany to pass through Czechoslovakia in ten days and cross Romania to attack the Ukraine of Soviet Russia. (Fifteenth National Telegram)</p>

<p>Nanjing – In recent years, most Confucian temples in provincial capitals have fallen into disrepair, and some have even been damaged due to the stationing of troops. Moreover, the mausoleums of emperors and the tombs of famous people in various regions have been frequently excavated. In October of the previous year, the Ministry of Interior formulated three types of survey forms for Confucian temples, mausoleums, and the excavation of ancient tombs, which were distributed to various provinces and cities for reporting in order to plan for their restoration. Currently, while many have complied with the request to fill out and submit these survey forms, some have yet to do so. The Ministry of Interior is eager to complete this survey work and yesterday issued another order urging the civil affairs departments of various provinces to order their subordinates to complete, verify, and submit the forms by a deadline, with no further delays allowed.

<p>Nanjing – According to statistics from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, among divorce cases from July 1933 to June 1934, Jiangsu Province had the most with 90 cases, followed by Zhejiang Province with 69 cases. In general, the more developed and open-minded a city is, the more divorce cases there are. Among those who divorced, women under the age of 20 were more than twice as likely to divorce as men, while men over the age of 30 were more than twice as likely to divorce as women. This is because older men have economic means and are not worried about not being able to remarry, while older women face difficulties in remarrying due to their age and declining appearance. The reasons for divorce include: bigamy (39 cases), adultery (48 cases), abuse by the other party (132 cases), abuse by relatives (58 cases), abandonment (69 cases), attempted murder (8 cases), serious illness (23 cases), mental illness (15 cases), unknown whereabouts (24 cases), and criminal offenses (31 cases). Of these, men filed for divorce in 104 cases, and women filed for divorce in 344 cases. (Nineteenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Nanjing – The Inspectorate General previously submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance stating that due to the overproduction of salt in the Huainan region, salt merchants purchasing excess salt quantities do not have sufficient capital to circulate and need to apply for loans from banks. The government may provide appropriate assistance, but the scope of assistance is limited to guaranteeing that when the salt pledged as collateral by the bank is sold, the government will deduct a certain amount from the salt price to repay the creditor until the principal and interest of the loan are fully repaid. Before the deduction is made, the salt will not be released. If the loan is not repaid when the new salt law is implemented and the salt pledged as collateral has not yet been sold, the government can guarantee the opportunity to sell it off. The Ministry of Finance reviewed the report and found that the proposed methods were appropriate and approved them. Nineteenth Central News Agency Telegram</p>

<p>Nanjing – The Ministry of Interior sent a letter to the Judicial Yuan requesting clarification on the definition of gambling crimes. The Judicial Yuan explained that the crime defined in Article 266, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code requires that the act be committed in a public place or a place accessible to the public. The act defined in Article 45, Paragraph 1 of the Law on Punishment of Violations of Public Order also requires that the act be committed on a road or in a public place. Therefore, gambling in a residence or shop, even if the gamblers and gambling tools are easily visible from the outside or the gambling sounds are easily heard from the outside, does not conform to the aforementioned legal provisions. However, if it falls under the circumstances of Article 267 or Article 268 of the Criminal Code, it should be punished separately according to those articles. A letter has been sent to the Ministry of Interior for verification. (Nineteenth Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Nanjing – Luo Jiaheng, Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs in Chahar, stated that the six counties in northern Chahar are currently occupied by Li Shouxin's troops, and the local situation is not very clear. Our army is stationed 60 li north of Zhangjiakou. The local situation in northern Chahar is relatively stable. Li's troops and Zhuo Shihai's troops total 3,000 men. Rumors that Chahar will be moved to Xuanhua are absolutely untrue. It has been investigated that the source of these rumors is that Chairman Zhang Zizhong went to Beiping for medical treatment due to a stomach ailment and visited Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, to discuss provincial affairs. He stayed in Beiping for a slightly longer period of time, which led to the rumors. Zhang has now left Beiping and returned to Chahar, which should clarify the matter. Foreign affairs agencies stationed in Chahar include a Japanese consulate, a special agency, and a Russian consulate. After the Zhangbei incident was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, the number of incidents has gradually decreased. In general, if there is a solution to the overall Sino-Japanese negotiation, then northern Chahar will not be a problem. It was previously rumored that De Wang was in Zhangbei and formed a military government with Li Shouxin's troops, but this has not been confirmed. After arriving in Nanjing, I met with Foreign Minister Zhang and visited friends. I am now going to Shanghai to attend to personal matters and will return to Nanjing in a week to ask for instructions and resume my post. (Nineteenth Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the dispute arose regarding Alxa Banner's request to abolish the Dengkou County seat in Ningxia, rumors have been rampant, and opinions have been divided. Tang Kesan, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, was dispatched north to Alxa Banner via Beiping to mediate. He has now returned to Ningxia and met with Ma Hongkui, the chairman of the provincial government. However, because the six conditions proposed by Alxa Banner far exceed the scope of ordinary negotiations, a resolution is still pending. Fearing that distant rumors might distort the truth, Ma Hongkui specifically sent a letter to Bai Jianmin, the resident representative in Beiping, explaining the details of the dispute for clarification. The complete documents are recorded below:</p>
<p>Alxa Banner Proposes Six Conditions</p>
<p>As a result of the mediation by Tang Kesan, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, in Alxa Banner, the banner proposed six conditions at Sakeda Lizhara to seek a resolution. The content includes: The sovereignty of Dengkou still belongs to this banner; the Dengkou County government will not be abolished temporarily but will report to the central government in the shortest possible time to withdraw from the banner's territory; the land temporarily occupied by the Dengkou County government should be given a corresponding rent (rent for the county government's land was paid in previous years); the area from Dengkou south to Shizuishan (about 120 li) will be temporarily administered by the Dengkou County government on behalf of the banner, and it should be returned to the banner as soon as the Dengkou County government withdraws from the banner; all administrative powers in places such as Wulan Mutu, Fujiawanzi, Shang Jiang Ershiliuzi, Sanshenggong, Guangqingyuan, and Dukoutang above Dengkou should not be interfered with by the Dengkou County government of the province, and the names of the county government office and various district offices in Guangqingyuan should be abolished immediately; the tax bureaus and checkpoints set up by the provincial government in places such as Dengkou Tukemudu, Dashuigou, and Daobulu within the banner should be returned to the banner immediately to handle them independently in accordance with regulations; unless there are special circumstances, mutual assistance should be provided, and after prior consultation and agreement, the provincial government should not arbitrarily send troops to garrison in any place within the banner.</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui's Telegram to Jiang and Huang</p>
<p>Ma Hongkui sent a telegram to Jiang Jieshi, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Huang Musong, the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, stating: "Urgent telegram. Member Tang Kesan returned to Ningxia from Alxa Banner and stated in person that he was ordered to mediate the Dengkou County establishment case. After repeated persuasion, the banner finally did not insist on abolishing the county seat but proposed six requirements, which are quite astonishing to read. Member Tang must have submitted a separate report detailing the situation, hoping to have it noted. The establishment of Dengkou County was due to the increasing number of foreigners renting land and reclaiming land in the area north of Dengkou after the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year of the previous Qing dynasty, as well as the free land reclamation by the people of this province. Over the years, it has developed into a densely populated area. At that time, the farmers in that area were all Han Chinese who migrated from Pingluo County in Ningxia. All civil and criminal lawsuits had to be filed with the Pingluo County government. The roads were long and remote, causing great inconvenience. In addition, that area has always been the key to the northern gate of Ningxia, holding the central hub of Bao Ning's transportation. Various tax bureaus, salt bureaus, and telegraph bureaus all require effective protection by the government. Therefore, the Gansu Provincial Government, before the establishment of Ningxia Province in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, based on the facts and local needs, requested the central government to approve the establishment of a county for separate administration. For six or seven years, peace has prevailed, and Alxa Banner has never raised any objections. Since I took office, considering the special circumstances of the county, most of the land has been leased to churches for reclamation and operation due to the Boxer Indemnity. Before the provincial government has raised funds to redeem it, everything has been maintained as it is, and there are no other facilities. Guangqingyuan and its surrounding areas have always been the garrison of Gansu troops, but the barracks were destroyed by Sun's army, and not a single soldier has been stationed there since. Local security is purely the responsibility of the county. Last year, the Red bandits fled westward, and Mao and Liu joined forces in northern Shaanxi, approaching Ningbian Dengkou, making defense extremely urgent. Comprehensively considering the situation, I reluctantly ordered the county to train militiamen to strengthen their self-defense capabilities. Alxa Banner repeatedly obstructed it, and after explanation, there were no other expressions. Now, after reading the six requirements of the banner, they completely obliterate the facts and overturn the established case. Not only can the central government's decrees be blatantly disregarded, but even if the provincial government abandons its duty to defend the territory, how can the Han Chinese in the county willingly accept it? Where will their insatiable demands end? For example, the third requirement states that the area from Dengkou south to Shizuishan will be temporarily administered by the Dengkou County government on behalf of the banner, and it should be returned to the banner as soon as the Dengkou County government withdraws from the banner. Nothing is more absurd and ridiculous than this. The distance from Dengkou to Shizuishan is 120 li, but the sandy shore along the river is only half a li wide and has always been barren. Since there are no residents, why bother with the county government's proxy administration? Moreover, Dengkou is named after the place, which must have a fixed scope and is not comparable to nomadic areas. The banner's requirement is merely an attempt to temporarily conceal its true intentions in order to achieve its goal of abolishing the county seat. However, geographical and historical relations cannot be vaguely obliterated. Comprehensively reviewing all the requirements, the fourth requirement, which states that the provincial government and Dengkou County shall not interfere with the administrative powers of Wulan Mutu, Fujiawanzi, Shang Jiang Ershiliuzi, Sanshenggong, Guangqingyuan, Dukoutang, and other places above Dengkou, is even more contrary to the facts. The division of governance in a country is based on land and people. In the past, the Gansu Provincial Government, considering that the Han Chinese who migrated from Pingluo County had been managing Wulan Mutu, Fujiawanzi, and other places under Dengkou for many years and were becoming increasingly prosperous, established the county in response to the needs of the times. If the administrative power of that area cannot be interfered with by the county government, then the Dengkou County government is truly a castle in the air. Why bother with the establishment of the county at that time? Moreover, after the establishment of the county, it was divided into districts for management. Why did Alxa Banner have no objections at that time? There is no justification for it in theory or in practice. As for the fifth requirement, the tax bureaus and checkpoints set up by the provincial government in places such as Dengkou Tukemudu, Dashuigou, and Daobulu within the banner should be returned to the banner for independent management. Regardless of whether the banner has the right to set up bureaus and collect taxes, the unified tax system in Dengkou County was established in the early years of the Republic of China and was not originally owned by the banner. Therefore, there is no question of returning this institution. Since Ningxia was changed to a province, this unified tax has been a major source of revenue for the provincial army. The establishment of branch checkpoints by the Dengkou Tax Bureau in places such as Tukemudu Dashuigou is also a decades-old established case and does not interfere with Alxa Banner. The Shuofang Dao Zhi records it in detail and can be reviewed. Moreover, successive governments in Ningxia have covered the expenses of Dengkou County from the provincial treasury and have never collected a single penny from the farmers in various districts. However, they have never dared to abandon their obligations to maintain transportation, protect the people, and build the Bao Ning Highway recently. The banner had no suggestions or recommendations for local affairs before and after the establishment of Dengkou County. Why would it want to seize the bureaus and checkpoints that have been established for decades? Who would believe that it is not taking advantage of the opportunity to coerce? Moreover, the central government has formulated regulations for the Mongolian Political Council, stipulating that counties shall not be established in Mongolian areas where counties have not been established, and that areas where counties have already been established shall continue to be handled according to the original plan. The decree is clear and cannot be ignored. Moreover, if this tax bureau can be run by the banner itself, then why can't the banner reclaim and run the existing central government agencies in the county, such as the salt tax bureau, telegraph bureau, and post office, with their insatiable demands? A little concession will surely be used as an excuse, and future responses will be extremely difficult. I am stationed in Ningxia, concerned about the current difficulties. I have heard that the banner is complaining, and I am truly afraid that the county magistrate of the county will be too hasty in responding. I have already transferred him to the province and appointed another commissioner to take over, with the sole intention of showing concession and fulfilling the central government's intention to appease the Mongolian people. I did not expect them to take an inch and demand a foot, making such excessive demands. I am fulfilling the laws and regulations and have no preconceived notions. However, I am particularly afraid that if I make too many concessions, the system will be distorted, the laws will be ineffective, and the future of the Northwest will become more complicated. As for the banner's financial difficulties, it may be true. In the future, for the sake of settling the matter and appeasing the people, the provincial government can still discuss providing assistance within its capabilities. Your Excellency travels through the nine border regions, handling countless matters every day. What I have stated is what I believe is appropriate. I respectfully request your wise decision. I am extremely anxious. Your subordinate, Ma Hongkui, bows."</p>
<p>Alxa Banner's Report to the Ministries and Commissions</p>
<p>Alxa Banner's report to the Ministry of Interior and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission states: "One report is for the urgent matter of being infringed upon, dispatching personnel to state the situation, and earnestly requesting prompt relief. Since Ningxia Province built fortresses in the Guangqingyuan area of our banner, intending to move the county seat there, our banner has previously prevented it. Recently, the Dengkou County officials have been moved to Guangqingyuan, forcibly occupying houses and implementing official duties. Furthermore, large troops have been dispatched to garrison there, intending to use force to suppress, build fortresses, and forcibly establish the county seat. We have always responded with peaceful methods. Although we have repeatedly negotiated reasonably, they have been ignored. The boundary between our banner and Ningxia Province has always been extremely clear and can be verified. Since the establishment of Dengkou County, all intrusions by Ningxia Province have been justified by the jurisdiction of Dengkou County. Therefore, the disputes in our banner are all caused by the establishment of Dengkou County. If Dengkou County is not abolished, the difficulties of our banner will not end. The establishment of Dengkou County was originally based on the report by Ningxia Province that the territory of Pingluo County was vast and difficult to govern, requesting to divide and establish it. It is clear that Dengkou County should be established within the territory of Pingluo. However, it has now been established within the territory of our banner and is constantly expanding. Recently, troops have been dispatched to press the border and forcibly occupy the area. The people of our banner are extremely indignant. We should personally go to your ministry to state everything in person and request a solution. However, due to the entanglement of banner affairs, we cannot separate. Therefore, we have specifically dispatched Chen Erde Ni Batu, the leader of the delegation, to report the actual situation. We hereby submit a document to request your ministry to review and verify the facts and earnestly request that Dengkou County be withdrawn from our banner's territory in order to quell the dispute. As for the establishment of bureaus by Ningxia Province within the inland areas of our banner to collect taxes and various other matters, we also ask for proper measures to be shown to clarify the jurisdiction of our banner and hope for a speedy resolution. We are infinitely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Interior, Alxa Banner Zhasake Dali Zhaya."</p>
<p>Ningxia Provincial Government's Reply to the Ministries and Commissions</p>
<p>The Ningxia Provincial Government's reply to the Ministry of Interior and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission states, "Inquiry reveals that Guangqingyuan, which belongs to Dengkou County, has always been the garrison of Gansu troops. At the beginning of the establishment of the province in the eighteenth year, the Executive Yuan approved the change to a county, and the area was designated as the second administrative district of the county. Over the past seven years, great efforts have been made to cultivate the land, and everything has progressed quite well. People are engaged in commerce and agriculture, and they are all happy to comply. During the provincial political conferences held in the province two years ago, local representatives proposed redeeming the land rights. The provincial government has not yet implemented it. Unexpectedly, Alxa Banner has a very strong feudal ideology. Hearing this situation, they were sincerely afraid that the recovery would be inconvenient for them in the future, so they became covetous. Colluding with the secret church, they began by saying that they occupied their vassal territory, and then demanded the abolition of the county, trying to use this as a buffer. The provincial government did not care about it, as there is no distinction between this border and that border in the national territory. They also exhausted their reasons and subsided silently. Last autumn, the Red bandits fled westward, and the defenses of the three borders were tight. We were ordered by the central government to defend against the Red bandits, so we trained militiamen in each county and built blockhouses. I also stationed troops in the common area to consolidate the defenses. The county government established an office to facilitate administration and planned to restore the old fortresses to prepare for the stationing of troops. Unfortunately, Alxa Banner did not understand this intention and sent several teams of border officials to interfere unreasonably, exerting undue pressure, and the situation was bound to escalate. In order to settle the matter and appease the people, the provincial government sent personnel to negotiate and handle it peacefully. The matter was settled, but Alxa Banner secretly used means, slandering and attacking incessantly. Judging by their intentions, they wanted to take advantage of the national crisis to collude with various parties and conspire to abolish the county in order to achieve their private aim of encroachment. Obviously, there is another background. The interests of the provincial government are involved, and we will never rest. Therefore, we have copied the files of the previous requests to abolish the county (see the above documents) and hope that you will interact with all parties in Beiping at all times, explaining in detail, so that the truth will be revealed and the incident can be resolved. I specifically publicize this and wish you a happy spring, Ma Hongkui."</p>
<h3 id="e77">Doihara's Talk on the Hebei-Chahar Incident: Claims That Liu Guitang and Li Shouxin Have Nothing to Do With the Japanese and Puppets; Negotiations Between the Two Sides Are in Private Exchange of Opinions <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: In the Hebei-Chahar negotiations, the Hebei East issue is difficult to resolve, and Yin Rugeng's attitude remains unyielding. Doihara, the chief of the special service agency of the Kwantung Army stationed in Shenyang, recently went to Tongzhou to meet with Yin once. Therefore, the negotiations between the two sides are still in a private exchange of opinions, and the date of formal negotiations cannot be determined for the time being.</p>
<p>Doihara recently told visitors in Beiping, "I plan to stay in Beiping for another three weeks and then return to Changchun. The rumor that I (Doihara refers to himself) have been hired as a senior advisor is not true. I am only discussing North China issues with the North China authorities in a private capacity." "The work of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has made considerable progress recently, and the administration of Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin has gradually become clearer." "I personally am not an 'anti-Western ideology' person and do not advocate 'Asia is for Asians' or do this work, but I am completely based on Eastern culture and strive for the peace and happiness of the Eastern people." "My actions in North China at this time have been sympathized with and understood by the authorities in North China. The Nanjing authorities may also understand in the future. In March last year, I had a long talk with former President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei in Nanjing, and he expressed considerable sympathy for my actions, but I had no opportunity to meet with Chairman Jiang at that time." "Regarding the increase of troops stationed in North China, I have not yet received any official documents from my country on this matter. The number of increases is not yet known, but according to my personal speculation, it will not increase too much. The purpose of increasing troops is to protect Japanese residents, not to invade North China's land. Because the number of Japanese residents in North China is increasing, there is this need." "Outsiders often question whether North China will break away from the Nanjing central government and become completely independent. I personally cannot represent the North China authorities to answer this question, but according to my personal observation, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee will not break away from the Nanjing central government." "Someone asked whether the Japanese side will assist the North China authorities in suppressing the Communists, as Communist activities have been discovered in southern Hebei and Suiyuan. This depends on the development of the actual situation. If the situation becomes increasingly serious, the Japanese military authorities in North China will naturally take this into account for their own responsibilities." "Regarding the issue of the 'Man'-Mongolian border and the Soviet-'Man' conflict, although the situation seems serious recently, I believe that the Soviet Union has no intention of invading 'Manchuria'. Therefore, I expect the situation not to become more serious. However, the Soviet-'Man' border must be demarcated clearly, and the border between Chahar North and Mongolia also needs to be demarcated clearly." "Liu Guitang has nothing to do with the Japanese side, because the Japanese side has no need for him. Li Shouxin also has no relationship with the 'Man' side. That department is a Mongolian troop." However, the visitor asked why Li's department raised the fake "Manchukuo" flag and wore fake "Manchukuo" military uniforms. Doihara did not answer. As for the rumor that Puyi will come to Beiping in March, Doihara firmly denies it.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Qingdao Executes Drug Offender for the First Time: Prisoner Paraded Through the Streets and Then Tied to the Execution Ground for Execution <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: In the era of Japanese administration in Qingdao, opium was sold by public sale, so there were particularly many people addicted to this habit. After our country took over, it was strictly prohibited. Most opium smokers switched to smoking white heroin and other drugs. Also, because there were certain country's ronin secretly selling them, although the authorities strictly prohibited it, this bad habit has not been reduced much. In the past three years, more than 3,000 drug offenders have been arrested and sent to drug rehabilitation centers by the Public Security Bureau. There are still seven or eight hundred drug offenders detained in the center. Since the municipal government was ordered by the central government last year to establish a trial office for violent drug offenders and appointed Secretary General Hu Jiafeng as the director and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Shize as the deputy director, it was planned to select several drug offenders with serious crimes to be shot to serve as a warning. Initially, fifteen people were selected, and then three were selected from the fifteen. Of these three, two died of illness recently, leaving only the prisoner Ding Yuting. He was tied to the Tuandao execution ground at 2:00 p.m. on the 18th for execution. The investigation revealed that Ding was 26 years old, a native of Yexian County, Shandong Province, and worked as a clerk at the Tiande Shoe Store at No. 60, Xia Sifang Village. He had an addiction to smoking violent drugs on a regular basis. He was arrested by the Public Security Bureau on November 26, 23rd year of the Republic, and sent to the drug rehabilitation center to be forced to quit. After being issued a certificate of abstinence, he signed a statement that he was willing to be executed if he relapsed. Unexpectedly, the prisoner did not think of changing his ways and changed his name to Li Mingzhi and still frequented morphine houses. On February 1st of last year, he was discovered by the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Because there was no concrete evidence of smoking, he was sent back to his hometown after being detained. Before long, he sneaked back to Qingdao and relapsed. On September 25th of last year, he bought two small packages of heroin for two jiao of foreign currency at a morphine house on Wulu Road in Taitong Town. He was searched and found by the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. After confirming the facts, he was transferred to the trial office for violent drug offenders of the municipal government for trial. He confessed to relapsing without denial and was immediately sentenced to death. The case was submitted by the municipal government to the Military Affairs Commission for instructions and approval. On the afternoon of the 18th of this month, at 2:00 p.m., Deputy Director Wang Shize of the Trial Office presented the prisoner to verify his identity. He was tied up in a car, and officers and police of the special task force were sent to guard the car in full armor. Because it was the first time a drug offender was shot, the Public Security Bureau paraded him through the major streets of the city for the public to watch and to serve as a warning. The viewers along the way blocked the roads. After parading for more than an hour, he arrived at the Tuandao execution ground and was executed by shooting. The supervising officer was Shen Guojun, the third section chief of the Public Security Bureau. After the shooting, more than 200 drug offenders in the Tuandao drug rehabilitation center were called out to watch the execution. After Section Chief Shen strictly reprimanded the drug offenders, the Public Security Bureau prepared a coffin for burial. (18th)</p>

<p>Hupu Town, located near the riverside, is a famous fishing ground in Jiangsu Province. The fish market is very prosperous every spring and summer, but the amount of tax revenue is huge. There was originally a fish ticket tax office there, which levied a tax of three cents per ticket. Unexpectedly, most of this tax revenue was embezzled by the fish merchants. After citizen Wang Yu filed a complaint with the province, the Finance Department sent Wang Zijun to Changshu to investigate. They found that the allegations were indeed true. As a result, the fish merchants were ordered to return all the tax revenue they had embezzled over the years, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. Now, the local citizens believe that this tax revenue was originally designated for local construction, and they request that it still be designated for repairing the dike in Hupukou after it is returned.</p>

<p>In order to implement civic training and concentrate economic talents, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has ordered all civil education institutions in all counties of the province to be closed. It has also been decided that all counties south of the Yangtze River must stop working before March 15th. All expenses will be used for training expenses, and all personnel in the various institutions will be recommended by the county to preside over public training. The Education Bureau here has been ordered to inform the various institutions to comply and close down, and all equipment and miscellaneous items of the institutions will be taken care of by personnel dispatched by the Education Bureau.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of spring in this county, the weather has been gloomy and cold, with roads covered in rain and snow. On the 30th of last month, there was heavy fog. From 7 PM the night before last, dense fog again engulfed the area, obstructing the air. Within five steps, one could not distinguish pedestrians, and a foul smell permeated the fog, making people susceptible to illness. It gradually dissipated by yesterday morning, and the weather turned colder. According to the weather report from the second-class weather station in this county, there was heavy fog on the morning of the 17th, with precipitation of 0.3 millimeters. The total precipitation this month is 21.2 millimeters. The most frequent wind direction is north-northeast. The highest temperature was 4.1 degrees Celsius (39.4 degrees Fahrenheit), and the lowest temperature was 2.5 degrees Celsius (36.5 degrees Fahrenheit). This kind of heavy fog is particularly unfavorable for broad beans and wheat in the surrounding countryside. Spring weather requires gentle breezes and warm sunshine for crops to thrive. With gloomy cold and heavy fog, a poor harvest is inevitable in the future. On the morning of the 18th, the weather was still cold, with floating clouds covering the sky, as if it were winter. By 11 AM, snowflakes fluttered down, followed by snow pellets. By 2 PM in the afternoon, heavy snow was falling, and soon, the mountains, forests, and houses were all covered in white.</p>

It was decided that the reorganization of the Yuyao field, which had already begun, and the Daishan and former fields should continue. The research on various ongoing tasks was quite detailed. The 18 small salt fields that should be abolished will also be implemented after the reorganization. The total cost will be more than 3.6 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Second Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Celebrations Held by All Sectors: Grand Commemorative Meeting Held in the City Chamber of Commerce Yesterday Morning; Inspection of Government Agencies and Broadcast Speeches in the Afternoon <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, to commemorate the second anniversary of the New Life Movement, convened representatives from all sectors at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 19th to hold a commemorative meeting, which adjourned at 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, government agencies were inspected to review the results of implementing the New Life Movement, and directors Pan Gongzhan and Wu Xingya gave broadcast speeches. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Branches: The commemorative meeting was very well attended. Those present included instructor Wu Tiecheng, the presidium of Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Yang Hu, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Shouyong, general affairs director Jiang Hao, reception director Lu Jingshi, discipline director Cai Jingjun, as well as representatives from various government agencies and organizations Huang Xuchu, Zhu Xuefan, Yu Zhenhui, Lin Kecong, Lin Xianwen, Xia Huan, Li Shiyong, students and boy scouts from various schools, and all staff members of the New Life Movement Association, totaling more than 2,000 people.</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement: At the entrance of the venue, military police from the Chinese-administered areas of the city were stationed, with about a dozen guards. On both sides of the passage, boy scouts from the City Chamber of Commerce stood guard. At the entrance, staff members of the New Life Movement Association assisted the boy scouts in receiving guests. Boy scouts also maintained order inside the venue. The venue was covered with various slogans. In front of the rostrum was a bamboo cloth banner with the inscription "Shanghai All Circles Commemorate the Second Anniversary of the New Life Movement." All arrangements were extremely simple and solemn.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address: After the ceremonial procedures at 9:00 AM, Chairman Zhang Taoyong delivered the opening address, stating that the implementation of the New Life Movement has been in effect for two years. We firmly believe that the New Life Movement is the only way to save China at present. Therefore, since its implementation, it has been vigorously promoted and has become widespread throughout the country. The essence of the New Life Movement is to seek the productionization, artisticization, and militarization of life. Because of the current moral decline of the Chinese nation, militarization must be sought to save it. Because of the lack of rules in the spirit, artisticization must be sought to save it. China must also seek productionization to save it from economic decline. Such methods seek the revival of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Wu's Instructions: Instructor Wu Tiecheng then gave instructions, stating that the New Life Movement has been advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for two years. Because it deeply meets the needs of the times and is a major plan for the revival of the nation, it has become a prevailing trend, and the whole country has followed suit. In recent times, various movements in Chinese history have emerged one after another, but their effects have either only been seen in the advocacy of a few patriots, without being followed by the general public, or have only been a temporary excitement, without lasting power. The New Life Movement is different. The New Life Movement is the driving force for promoting new policies, reviving the nation, and advancing all cultural construction in China. The basic points of the New Life Movement lie in the spirit of "If one day is new, make it new again, and keep it new day after day," as well as the determination of "All kinds of things in the past are as if dead yesterday, and all kinds of things in the future are as if born today," sweeping away all the sluggish and decadent customs at the bottom of society, and eradicating all the decadent habits deeply rooted in people's hearts, in order to cultivate a new habit of perseverance, uprightness, unyielding, and upward struggle, so that the lives of the people of the whole country can become more rational, scientific, productive, revolutionary, militarized, modernized, and artistic. Therefore, in the future, this New Life Movement must be universally applied to the entire nation, penetrating the general public, so that it can become a habit, and the revival of the nation can be expected in the near future.</p>
<p>Wu's Speech: Wu Xingya then gave a speech, stating that the New Life Movement has been popular for two weeks under the guidance of President Chiang. Because the New Life Movement is a key plan to save the country and the nation, those of us who are responsible for promoting it should strive hard. On this second anniversary, we should first conduct a review of our work. In the past two years, from this city to the whole country, to what extent has the promotion of the New Life Movement reached? Second, self-reflection: Those of us who are responsible for promoting the movement should practice what we preach. Can we abide by all the rules of the New Life Movement? In terms of promotion, can we fulfill our responsibilities? Third, our beliefs: Are our beliefs in the New Life Movement firm? Fourth, our future direction: We should look around at the current environment in China and determine the direction of our actions. Madam Zhou Shang also gave a speech, which is omitted here.</p>
<p>Afternoon Inspection: Yesterday afternoon, Yang Hu, Cai Jingjun, Zhang Shouyong, Lu Jingshi, and other directors of the association set off in four groups to inspect the implementation of the Three-fold life (productionization, artisticization, and militarization) in various government agencies. The first group, led by Lu Jingshi and accompanied by Hu Tianseng, inspected the City Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Hydrographic Office, the Security Office, the Party Headquarters of the Security Office, the Bureau of Finance, the Bureau of Land, the Garrison Headquarters, the Second Special District Court, the Third High Court Branch, and the Trademark Bureau. The second group, led by Yang Hu and accompanied by Zhu Jiarang, Chen Jie, and Wang Jiyi, inspected the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs, Bureau of Public Utilities, Bureau of Education, Bureau of Public Works, Bureau of Health, the Party Headquarters of the Two Roads (railways), the First Special District Court, and the Second High Court Branch. The third group, led by Zhang Shouyong and accompanied by Shen Liangzhong, inspected the Public Security Bureau, the Shanghai District Court, the Seafarers' Party Headquarters, the Defense Committee, the Jiangnan Shipyard, the Central Bank, the Telegraph Bureau, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. The fourth group, led by Cai Jingjun and accompanied by Yang De'an and Han Wenpu, inspected the International Telegraph Office, the Postal Administration Bureau, the Two Roads Administration Bureau, the International Trade Bureau, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the Jianghai Customs Superintendency, and the Central Mint. After completing their inspections, all groups agreed that given Shanghai's special circumstances, the spirit shown by the various agencies was commendable. It was heard that the inspection directors on the spot encouraged gradual progress. The Eleventh Detachment of the Youth Service Corps of the association, led by the leaders of the detachment, guided pedestrians and traffic order in their respective areas, as well as provided labor services at train stations, docks, restaurants, barbershops, and residential areas. All detachments were able to conscientiously fulfill the regulations.</p>
<p>Zhang's Speech: Yesterday was the second anniversary of the New Life Movement. In addition to convening a commemorative meeting of representatives from all sectors at the City Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association also conducted a general inspection of all public service agencies in the city. Zhang Shouzhu, the director of the association and president of Guanghua University, was the inspector for the third group. He went to the Nanshi Public Security Bureau for inspection at 2:00 PM yesterday. Cai Jingjun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, was the inspector for the fourth group and had already gone to the Customs and the Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection. The bureau's secretary director Su Liping, first section chief Chen Guangzong, chief inspector Da Zaisui, and director of the New Life Movement section Han Wenpu, among others, temporarily received and guided the inspection team, touring the offices, detention centers, and other places of the bureau, which they found satisfactory. Afterwards, they gave a speech to all the staff members of the bureau in the auditorium. The original speech is as follows: Comrades, usually when the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association holds directors' meetings, many matters are decided to be handled by the Public Security Bureau. The New Life Movement Promotion Association has become a hollow organization. Only the Public Security Bureau is the actual promoting agency of the New Life Movement. Today, the New Life Movement Promotion Association sent me here to inspect the achievements of your bureau in implementing the New Life Movement. I am very grateful to the secretary director, the chief inspector, and the section chiefs for their guidance and reception, and for holding a meeting to welcome me. On the one hand, I express my infinite gratitude, and on the other hand, I feel infinite joy. I have seen that the work and management of the various departments of your bureau are very effective, and the spirit of work is very good. This shows the efforts of everyone in promoting the New Life Movement. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau is truly worthy of being a model for Shanghai. From this, we can see the spirit of rectifying police administration and implementing the New Life Movement. I usually think that the life of a criminal in prison is the most tragic thing in the world. Therefore, I especially went to your bureau's detention center to take a look. Although the place of your bureau's detention center is not very large, it is very clean inside, and there is no smell. The life of the prisoners is also comfortable. This is really a rare thing. Everyone must know that it is better to prevent trouble before it happens than to eliminate it after it has happened. Everyone has the responsibility to enforce the law. Now, everyone is promoting the New Life Movement, and if you use the method of moral persuasion instead of punishment, the masses will be easily moved and accepted. In this way, the New Life Movement promoted by Mr. Chiang will surely be carried out without hindrance and become the foundation of national revival. In the past, when I attended a financial conference, Mr. Dai Jitao once said, "The situation of Chinese government offices is the same as that of the local bailiffs and tax card checkers." I was very moved when I heard this sentence. Could it be that the evils of society are all the evils of officials? Therefore, the promotion of the New Life Movement must first of all enable everyone to lead by example. Today, when I came to your bureau to see the achievements of the New Life Movement, I felt that everyone's spirit was very good and their work was very serious. Everyone can truly be said to be leading by example. What everyone is doing is the foundation of national revival. I run schools and educate young people, which is also the foundation of the country. I am sixty-one years old this year. I think that we old people should follow the young people. Old people can only talk about their experiences, and the implementation still depends on young people. I am very happy to see you young comrades today, so I say these words from my heart to contribute to everyone. If everyone still thinks that what the old man said is worth listening to, and not "old hat," then I hope everyone will take what this old man said as a reference. Finally, I wish everyone good health, work hard for the country, and promote the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Slogans Everywhere: The New Life Movement Association placed large bamboo cloth banners with slogans high above the roads in key intersections such as Laoximen, Xiaodongmen, and Baoshan Road, etc. Slogans were also posted on trams and buses in Nanshi and Zhabei. Various slogans were also posted in various busy places, attracting attention.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Wang Jingwei Went to Europe Yesterday for Medical Treatment: It Is Only Temporary and He Will Return Once Recovered; Madam Wang Did Not Travel Due to Illness <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Jingwei, the chairman of the Central Political Committee who was recovering from injuries in Shanghai, took the North German Lloyd ship "Nassau" to Europe yesterday for medical treatment. Mr. Wang's trip is only temporary. Those traveling with him include Zeng Zhongming, Chen Yaozu, and Dr. Zhuer. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure Yesterday: News of Wang's departure for medical treatment has been circulating for a long time, but those around him have denied it. Therefore, it was not confirmed until after he boarded the ship yesterday afternoon. Zeng Zhongming still denied the news of Wang's transfer for medical treatment fifteen minutes before Wang's departure. This shows the secrecy of Wang's whereabouts. Wang, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, left his residence on Anhe Temple Road at 2:45 PM yesterday in a Beijing Municipal Police registration car No. 490 and a Shanghai Concession registration car No. 11180. At 3:10 PM, he arrived at the New Customs Wharf. Along the way and near the New Customs Wharf, detectives from the Public Concession Police Department were specially dispatched to escort him. After Wang arrived at the New Customs Wharf, he immediately boarded the Maoxin small ferry to the Eleventh Floating Pontoon and boarded the "Nassau" ship. At 4:30 PM, the ship set sail for Europe. Only Central Committee Member Chu Minyi and his wife, Legislative Committee Member Lin Baisheng and his wife, Wang's secretary Lin Ruheng, and more than twenty reporters from various newspapers went to the wharf to see him off.</p>
<p>Madam Stays in Shanghai: Those who accompanied Wang abroad yesterday included former Railway official Zeng Zhongming and former Deputy Director of the Jinpu Railway Chen Yaozu. Foreign advisor Tang Liangli also traveled to Europe on the same ship for investigation. Dr. Noel, who happened to be returning to Germany for business, specially accompanied Wang so that all treatments on the ship could proceed as usual. It was also heard that German doctor Professor Sauerbruch, the world's only expert in wound treatment, will be visited by Wang after arriving in Europe for consultation. As for Madam Chen Bijun, Wang's wife, she has been suffering from a severe cold since the 13th or 14th, and doctors diagnosed her with pneumonia, which was very serious. The fever only slightly subsided on the 17th or 18th, and her condition only slightly improved, but she was still unable to get out of bed. Therefore, Madam Wang did not travel with him yesterday, nor did she see Wang off on the ship.</p>
<p>Good Spirits: Wang wore a gray-blue long robe and a black mandarin jacket yesterday. When he got out of the car at the New Customs Wharf, he held a cane in one hand and a felt hat in the other, and was supported by people on the left and right as he boarded the ship. Wang's face looked slightly pale, but he was still plump and in good spirits, and his gait was also healthy.</p>
<p>Injuries and Symptoms: According to Wang's entourage, Wang was assassinated on November 1st last year and suffered three bullet wounds. One was in his left arm, and the bullet passed through the skin and flesh. After treatment, it completely healed. However, one bullet in his back, right above the upper left side of the ribs, was taken out once on the day of the injury. After arriving in Shanghai on the 21st of the same month, he underwent a second operation on the 29th, but it has not been removed. Even now, it still hurts from time to time. As for the bullet in his left cheek, although it was removed at the Central Hospital, it injured the muscles and nerves too much. Until now, the muscles in his left cheek cannot move freely, and his mouth can only open to the width of one finger. He still needs to undergo electrotherapy every day to gradually restore the muscles. This is the general situation of Wang's injuries since the assassination. Wang also suffered from diabetes and gallstones. After November 1st, due to excessive blood loss from the injuries, it was repeatedly triggered. Dr. Noel, who has been treating Wang, paid special attention to this, and fortunately it did not worsen. However, since the source of the disease has not been removed, medicine is indispensable. In addition, his whole body was weakened after the serious injuries, which affected his heart, resulting in a new symptom of intermittent pulse. In recent days, the intermittent phenomenon often reached seven or eight times per minute. This is also the general situation of Wang's old illnesses triggered by new wounds after the assassination.</p>
<p>Telegram to Meet Hu: According to Wang's entourage, transferring to another place for medical treatment has long been advocated by the doctors treating Wang's injuries. Later, upon hearing the news of Mr. Hu Hanmin's return to China, it was first said that Hu would arrive in Hong Kong on the 19th on the original ship and come to Shanghai. Later, there was news that he would rest in Hong Kong for a few days before going north. Wang wanted to wait for Hu to come north in order to meet him, so the transfer for medical treatment was repeatedly postponed, and this news was not announced. On the 8th of this month, Wang sent a telegram to Hu, explaining this intention. The telegram contained the words "Originally scheduled to transfer for medical treatment at the end of last month, but repeatedly changed the travel date in order to wait for instruction," and asked when Hu could come. He then received a reply telegram from Hu on the 10th, which stated, "Since entering Guangdong, I have been frequently suffering from colds due to the changing climate. The doctors all say that my physical strength cannot withstand the cold weather in the north, and I still need to rest for a while." Wang, realizing that Hu could not come immediately, followed the doctor's advice and transferred for medical treatment first. According to a representative of the Guangdong side stationed in Shanghai, the procedures for Wang's departure were completed half a month ago. It was originally planned to go abroad earlier, but it was delayed in order to wait for a meeting with Hu Zhantang, the chairman of the Central Standing Committee. Now that Hu cannot come immediately, he will leave first. He may be able to meet Hu when passing through Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Short-Term Trip Abroad: Wang will reportedly land in Marseille and then transfer to Germany. However, his entourage said that it has not yet been decided where Wang will land in Europe. This trip is purely for medical treatment and there are no other opinions to be expressed. According to Wang, this trip will be very short, probably no more than a few months. Once his injuries and illnesses have been slightly relieved, he will return to China. Due to his illness, all visits and social interactions along the way will be declined.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Formal Agreement Signed for Nanping Section Loan: 10 Million Yuan Each for Construction Funds and Material Purchases; Procedures for Loan Distribution and Material Purchases Have Been Stipulated <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>10 Million Yuan Each for Construction Funds and Material Purchases Procedures for Loan Distribution and Material Purchases Have Been Stipulated The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company is extending the railway from Nanchang to Pingxiang. The Ministry of Railways issued a second phase of railway construction bonds of 27 million yuan on February 1st to borrow 10 million yuan each from Shanghai banking groups and Otto Wolff Steel Works for construction funds and material purchases. The chairman of the railway company, Zeng Yangfu, negotiated with the banking groups and submitted the agreement to the Ministry of Railways for approval. The agreement was formally signed in Shanghai a few days ago. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Funds and Material Purchases The Ministry of Railways issued a second phase of railway construction bonds of 27 million yuan and allocated them to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company for the extension of the railway from Nanchang to Pingxiang. The chairman of the company, Zeng Yangfu, was responsible for contacting the Shanghai banking groups represented by the Bank of China and the German Otto Wolff Steel Works. It was decided that both the construction funds and the materials would be changed to 10 million yuan each. The interest rate and repayment period of the loan were immediately discussed, and a draft contract was drawn up. Zeng carried it to Beijing and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for approval. Then, a few days ago, he came to Shanghai and invited representatives from various banks to formally sign the agreement.</p>
<p>Formal Agreement Has Been Signed The agreement was signed on the 11th of this month. Zeng Yangfu represented the Ministry of Railways. The representatives from the banking groups included Huo Laishu from the Bank of China, Zhang Peishen from the Bank of Communications, Wu Yunzhai from the Jincheng Bank, Zhu Runsheng from the Farmers Bank of China, Wang Zhixin from the Xinhua Bank, Wu Shiyi from the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, Song Ziliang from the China Construction Finance Corporation, Shen Shuyu from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and Wolff from the German Steel Works. A total of two general agreements were signed. One copy was held by the Ministry of Railways and the other by the banking groups. The agreement for the purchase of materials was also signed in the same format, with an attached price list, detailing the prices of various materials required.</p>
<p>Distribution of Construction Funds The total amount of construction funds borrowed is 10 million yuan, which is borrowed by eight banks including the Bank of China. The Bank of China has the most, with 3.2 million yuan. The Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank of China each have 2 million yuan. The Jincheng Bank has 1 million yuan. The Xinhua Bank, the Jiangxi Yumin Bank, and the China Construction Finance Corporation each have 500,000 yuan. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has 300,000 yuan. The funds will be released to the banking groups as needed when the project progresses. The material purchase is also limited to 10 million yuan. The steel rails, sleepers, bridges, locomotives, telegraphs, telephones, and other materials needed during the project will be supplied by the factory. However, the order must be placed before June 15th of this year, and the factory must deliver the goods within eight weeks of receiving the order. The factory must also notify the banking groups of the total number of materials ordered within one week.</p>
<p>Repayment Period The agreement stipulates that the construction funds will be repaid in five years, with an annual interest rate of one percent, starting from January of this year. Interest will be settled and paid on June 30th and December 31st each year. The material purchase funds will be repaid in six years, with an annual interest rate of seven percent, and interest will also be paid on June 12th and December each year. The repayment method stipulates that after the railway section is open to traffic and in operation, 20 percent of the net profit will be allocated each year for the banking groups to distribute and repay the banking groups and the German factory. The banks receive two-thirds of the total amount, and the German factory receives one-third, until the debt is cleared. The income of the railway must be deposited in the Bank of China at any time for accounting and payment.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Announcement by the Banking Association: Checks Are Exempt from Stamp Duty <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association announced yesterday that the National Government has issued an order exempting checks from stamp duty. Yesterday, it separately notified all banks in the association and published a notice in the newspaper to alert bank depositors. The details of this matter are as follows:</p>
<p>Request Process The Shanghai Banking Association previously received a letter from the Tianjin Banking Association, stating that the new stamp tax law stipulates that checks must be affixed with stamps, fearing that it would be like "exhausting the fish to collect taxes." It repeatedly requested the government to temporarily exempt them. However, on September 1st of last year, when the new stamp tax law went into effect, it had not yet received a reply. Therefore, on August 31st of last year, it announced to bank depositors that before the request for exemption was approved, it would temporarily comply with the law and all checks would be stamped.</p>
<p>Contact with the Tax Bureau On February 10th of this year, the National Government ordered that checks be temporarily exempted from stamp duty. It is heard that the banking sector had contacted the Stamp Tax Bureau. The bureau also stated that since the order had been promulgated, it should be followed. Based on this reply, the Banking Association notified the banks in the association to comply with the order and published a notice in the newspaper to alert all sectors.</p>
<p>Notice to All Sectors The Banking Association issued an announcement yesterday, stating, "Regarding the stamp tax on checks, this association has previously submitted a request to the legislative and financial authorities, earnestly requesting exemption. Now, the Legislative Yuan has reviewed and approved this case, allowing temporary exemption, and the National Government promulgated an order on February 10th of this year, which should be followed. In addition to notifying the banks in the association for investigation and handling, we hereby publish a notice in the newspaper to alert all sectors."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Goldsmith Industry Requests Modification of Regulations; Ministry of Finance Rejects, Guild Decides to Petition in the Capital <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Goldsmith Industry Guild, regarding the issue of gold and silver fineness, has repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to amend the management regulations. Yesterday, the guild received a response from the Ministry of Finance, document number Qian Zi 8630. The response stated: "Received and noted. Upon investigation, the preparation of alloys does not require the use of powerful boilers or oxygen smelting. Moreover, the melting point of alloys is consistently lower than that of their individual components, eliminating any difficulty in melting. The Ministry has already ordered the Central Mint to prepare and supply these alloys. The goldsmith industry can purchase them at any time, ensuring no work difficulties. The request to amend the management regulations to allow the continued manufacturing of products with the same composition is hereby denied. Please adhere to the Ministry's previous decision." After receiving the response, the guild immediately convened an executive committee meeting and decided to petition in the capital after the National Goldsmith Industry Representatives Conference is held.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tobacco Exchange Industry Proposes Setting Exchange Regulations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Shanghai Branch of the Tobacco Exchange Industry Guild, in view of the government's currency reform which offers convenience to various industries, and reports from members highlighting the significant impact on their business, specially convened an interim meeting yesterday of the supervisory and executive committees in the southern district of the city. The key proposals are listed below:</p>
<p>*   At the beginning of the new subsidiary currency's circulation, counterfeit coins have already been discovered in the market. The guild should petition the municipal government to order an investigation and crackdown, and notify members to be vigilant and avoid losses.</p>
<p>*   The circulation of subsidiary currency affects exchange rates. If the exchange rate is not standardized, it will be even more difficult to maintain business. The guild should petition the authorities to set the exchange rate at 3,000 [cash] per legal tender dollar to rectify the situation and prevent competition.</p>
<p>*   Exchange transactions have always been a major business for the industry, with profits derived from exchanging silver dollars for copper coins or silver dimes. Based on the market rate for such exchanges, several dozens of cash are deducted per dollar. Now that subsidiary currency is decimalized, if no handling fee is stipulated, arbitrary price suppression would easily cause disputes and undermine the currency system. The guild should petition the authorities to stipulate that for each legal tender dollar exchanged for subsidiary currency, a handling fee of one cent should be allowed, with no arbitrary deductions permitted.</p>
<p>*   Exchange transactions have always been the primary business of this industry. Other businesses receive copper coins and silver dimes, which are exchanged into silver dollars, and residents exchange silver dollars for silver dimes and copper coins, all through tobacco exchange shops. Now that the currency system is reformed and decimalization is promoted, other businesses can also engage in exchange transactions. If this is not restricted, the source of exchange transactions will be cut off, endangering the livelihoods of this industry, as well as affecting peddlers. Vegetable market peddlers, for example, sell for silver dimes and copper coins, which are then exchanged for silver dollars at tobacco exchange shops, typically with an additional 20 or 30 cash added. Now that other businesses are also engaging in exchange transactions, their exchange rates will inevitably be higher than those of tobacco exchange shops. If tobacco exchange shops offer an exchange rate of 3,000 cash, they will charge 3,020 or 3,030 cash when receiving silver dimes and copper coins from peddlers. Due to the higher exchange rates offered by other businesses, tobacco exchange shops will inevitably raise their purchasing rates, thereby harming the interests of peddlers. To protect the industry's business and maintain the livelihood of the people, the guild should petition the authorities to establish regulations for exchange transactions and allow for exclusive operation.</p>
<p>*   The delay in the guild's affairs has failed the trust of its members. Members are facing dangerous business conditions, previously due to disordered commodity prices and recently due to the impact of the currency system. It is urgent to find ways to protect the industry, take proactive measures, and avoid complacency, which would lead to self-destruction. The committees should be urged to expedite the proceedings to revitalize the business and safeguard the livelihoods of members.</p>
<p>*   The establishment of branch offices in the northern and southern districts was approved by the members' congress. Registration with the competent authorities should be completed. However, many days have passed without approval. The guild should promptly urge for the approval to complete the procedures and facilitate progress.</p>
<p>The above matters were resolved to be submitted to a plenary meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for a public decision.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Instructions on Stamp Duty for Leases <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to Lixing Paint Store yesterday with instructions on how to affix stamp duty to leases: "In reply, we have received your letter of the 18th of this month inquiring about the stamp duty for leases. We have taken note of it. The reply is as follows:</p>
<p>Your leases, you say, did not have stamp duty affixed in 1934 or 1935. The new Stamp Duty Law came into effect on September 1, 1935. Therefore, stamp duty on leases before September 1, 1935, should be handled according to the amount stipulated in the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty, affixing one dime per year.</p>
<p>Although the two years of missed stamp duty were within the period of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty, the Stamp Duty Inspection Office took away the leases in November, at which time the new Stamp Duty Law had already come into effect and the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty had been abolished. Therefore, the penalties for missed stamp duty should be handled in accordance with the penalty provisions of Article 18 of the new Stamp Duty Law, which is 10 to 30 times the amount of tax owed. For example, if the lease should have been affixed with one dime each year, the penalty for missed stamp duty is 3 yuan, calculated at 30 times the amount. For two years of missed stamp duty, the combined penalty is 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Using a lease to collect rent is the same as using a house ticket to collect rent, both being methods for landlords to collect money from tenants. However, a house ticket is issued by the landlord to the tenant, while a lease is issued by the tenant to the landlord. Therefore, the issuer of a house ticket is the landlord, while the issuer of a lease is the tenant. Therefore, the responsibility for affixing stamp duty to a lease, and the responsibility for missing stamp duty, should be borne by the tenant.</p>
<p>The stamp duty for this year's leases should be affixed annually at two dimes each, in accordance with Article 16, Clause 10 of the Stamp Duty Law."</p>

<h3 id="e104">Villagers of Hejiajiao Petition for Postponement of House Tax Collection <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Villagers of Hejiajiao in the French Concession of Western Shanghai are requesting the Municipal Finance Bureau to postpone the collection of house tax. Four representatives, Wang Guangrun, Xing Pengju, Yang Xingchu, and Yang Shuguo, were elected by the entire village to depart for the Municipal Government yesterday morning with a petition. The reasons are as follows: Hejiajiao in the French Concession is a purely rural village with over 200 households living in simple, low-lying houses inherited from their ancestors, merely sheltering themselves from the wind and rain. The population of over 1,000 people mostly makes a living by farming, with some engaged in industry. However, in recent years, natural disasters and man-made calamities have followed one after another, and they have been affected by the urban economic downturn. Farmers have suffered from poor harvests and low prices, and industrial and commercial enterprises have failed. Living at home, they are in dire straits, barely able to feed themselves. The Municipal Finance Bureau's collection of house tax is truly difficult to comply with. They jointly request the government to allow a postponement of the collection to alleviate the suffering of the people. At 9:30 AM, the first group of petitioners arrived at the Municipal Government. The second group of people were stopped by the police at the Seventh District Public Security Gate, but the police chief escorted the four representatives to the Municipal Government, where the mayor sent Director Yuan of the Second Section to receive them. He promised to submit the petition to the mayor and assured them that he would convey the difficulties of the farmers. The representatives were satisfied and returned to the village with the people. It was already past 3 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sues Shareholders of Yikang and Yongxing Money Shops; Over 4,000 Yuan Owed to Exhibition Hall Fund; Should Be Cleared by Shareholders Yan Ruling et al. <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is suing the shareholders of the Yikang and Yongxing money shops for owing a total of over 4,000 yuan to the Chamber's Exhibition Hall Library Fund. Yesterday, Zheng Zenan, director of the Chamber's Finance Department, filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court in his capacity as legal representative, requesting the shareholders of the two shops to clear the debts in full. The original complaint states: "For the matter of owed deposits, requesting joint and several repayment. The defendants Yan Ruling, Wu Jincheng, Peng Guinian, Xu Baoyuan, You Lianzeng, and Chen Sisheng are all shareholders of the Yikang Fengji Money Shop. The defendants Chen Dizhou, Yu Zhendong, Guo Ruoliang, Chen Zhongchi, and Chen Meibo are all shareholders of the Yongxing Money Shop. The plaintiff deposited 1,500 silver taels of standard silver, calculated at 715 [yuan] per tael, equivalent to 2,097.90 yuan, in each of the Yongxing and Yikang Fengji Money Shops as basic funds for the Chamber's Commodity Exhibition Hall Library. However, the Yongxing and Yikang money shops went bankrupt one after another in the first half of last year, and under the guise of liquidation, they have delayed repayment of the plaintiff's deposits. After repeated demands, Yongxing Money Shop only paid 400 yuan on May 6 of the same year, with the remaining amount still outstanding. This amount is a public fund of the plaintiff's Commodity Exhibition Hall Library, and it is not appropriate to allow it to remain outstanding. As of the end of December 1935, Yikang Money Shop owed the plaintiff 2,307.69 yuan, and Yongxing Money Shop owed the plaintiff 1,881.39 yuan. Therefore, we specially request your court to order the defendants Yan Ruling, Wu Jincheng, Peng Guinian, Xu Baoyuan, You Lianzeng, and Chen Sisheng to jointly and severally repay the plaintiff 2,307.69 yuan, plus interest at 1% per annum from January 1, 1936, until the date of repayment, and to order the defendants Chen Dizhou, Yu Zhendong, Guo Ruoliang, Chen Zhongchi, and Chen Meibo to jointly and severally repay the plaintiff 1,881.39 yuan, plus interest at 1% per annum from January 1, 1936, until the date of repayment. The litigation costs should be borne by the defendants for the sake of public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court for review."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refining Industry Guild, after receiving orders from the Silk and Satin Industry and the Electric Silk Weaving Industry Guilds to change its system, abolished the old method of pricing per piece of silk from the Spring Festival of this year and adopted the method of calculating length by the metric system, grading and pricing, and establishing a standard public scale. It was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the Silk and Satin Industry Guild did not agree to the monthly settlement. The Refining Industry believes that credit conditions are extremely tight at this time and suffered huge losses last year, making it impossible to extend the credit period. After several days of meetings and discussions, they decided to abandon transactions with customers who cannot settle monthly.</p>

<p>Xu Qizhong, son of Xu Guannan, residing at Wu Xingfu Lane on Zhejiang Road, is only 21 years old. Due to his indulgence in pleasure, he owes dance hall fees, restaurant bills, taxi fares, clothing and cosmetic expenses to establishments such as St. Anne, Paramount, Atlantic, Jinlong, Daxia, Livi, Fengxiang, and Sincere Department Store, totaling a huge sum of $31,000. Unable to repay, he applied for bankruptcy to Special Court No. 1. The court accepted the case and convened the first creditors' meeting some time ago. However, the estimated assets of Xu Qizhong were far less than the debt amount, and the meeting ended without result. At that time, Judge Yu persuaded both parties to make concessions and negotiate a compromise plan outside, waiting for the second creditors' meeting to decide. All these details were recorded in previous reports. According to the reporter's investigation, the debtor, Xu Qizhong, has submitted two mediation plans, which have been sent to the supervisor and assistant, accountant Wang Sifang, for distribution to the creditors for consultation and consent. The mediation plan is recorded as follows: The assets owned by Qizhong were indeed worth $26,399.14 in national currency at the time of purchase, and the car and wireless radio have invoices to prove it. The current estimate by the auction house is only $3,033 in national currency, which is too low. For the benefit of the creditors, it is proposed that the furniture, clothing, shoes, and hats be valued at 30% of the original price, and the remaining assets be halved as the minimum price. Representatives elected by the creditors will sell the assets themselves. All proceeds, after deducting the secured debts, should be distributed to the creditors in proportion to their respective claims. For the remaining amount, Qizhong will issue Xinglong notes for 40%. Please have the accountant review and submit this to the creditors' meeting. Respectfully submitted to Wang Sifang, Accountant, Xu Qizhong. (Datong News Agency)</p>

<p>Jin Xing Real Estate Company at No. 505, Henan Road, was managed by Sun Chunsheng. Due to heavy debts, creditors such as Henglong Money Exchange petitioned the court to declare bankruptcy. Special Court No. 1 ruled on October 17, 1935, at 9:00 AM, to grant the declaration of bankruptcy and appointed lawyer Liu Shifang and accountant Xie Lin as bankruptcy administrators. Liu and Xie then went to receive Sun's property on October 18 last year, accompanied by a clerk from Special Court No. 1. However, apart from three apprentices and tea servers, there were no other staff in Jin Xing Company. It was claimed that all account books had been taken away by Sun, resulting in no documents being received. It was also found that the stocks of Cathay Bank and Zhongyi Trust Company held by Sun had been transferred to his wife, Shao Yizhen, within one year before and after the bankruptcy. Furthermore, after the bankruptcy administrator was ordered to take over Sun's residence at No. 352, Huade Road, on January 28 this year, a Portuguese named Gao Shida suddenly came forward, claiming that the house had been leased to him by Sun on May 1 last year for a monthly rent of $150 for a term of ten years, and presented receipts for the payment of three years' rent of $5,400 as proof. All these acts violated Articles 154, 2, and 3 of the Bankruptcy Law regarding fraudulent bankruptcy. In order to prevent such evil practices in the future, lawyer Liu and accountant Xie, in their capacity as bankruptcy administrators, filed a criminal private prosecution against Sun Chunsheng with Special Court No. 1. Because Sun's whereabouts were unknown, they requested a warrant for his arrest in accordance with Articles 84, 5, and 6 of the Criminal Law. The case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Xiao Fen in the third criminal court. Sun Chunsheng's wife's appointed lawyer, Tai Fei, appeared in court and stated that Sun was currently in Hangzhou recuperating from a lung disease, and requested an adjournment to allow Sun to appear in court for questioning. Lawyer Liu Shifang immediately stated that it had been found that Sun was actually in Shanghai, employing more than a dozen Japanese as bodyguards, and presented an advertisement published by Sun as proof. The words in the advertisement were extremely absurd. It is copied as follows: "Since the Shanghai war on January 28, the global recession has had an impact, and all industries have been declining day by day. How can the real estate industry be alone? It is necessary to plan day and night to properly restore the difficult situation, resulting in excessive labor and neurasthenia. After careful treatment by Chinese and Western doctors, the illness has worsened. I followed the doctor's advice and left Shanghai to return home to recuperate for a long time. It has been several months since all symptoms have improved. I will return to Shanghai in a few days. This is a preliminary announcement to avoid the concern of relatives and friends." After reading it, Judge Xiao thought that the phrase "leaving Shanghai to return home" was extremely absurd. Could it be that he also wanted to imitate the actions of a traitor? He then asked Lawyer Xiong if he knew about Sun's advertisement. Lawyer Xiong replied that he did not know. Judge Xiao then ordered the case to be adjourned to the 26th to summon Sun to court for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Jiangbei Associations Discuss Relief for Unemployed Rickshaw Pullers; Deadline for Registering Unemployed Rickshaw Pullers; Notice of Precautions for Pulling Rickshaws <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the joint office of various Jiangbei associations in Shanghai convened its first delegates' meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the direction of progress. Due to rain, the number of delegates attending did not reach the legal quorum, so the meeting was changed to a discussion meeting to discuss the problem of relieving unemployed rickshaw pullers. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion on Relief Yesterday, more than ten delegates attended, including Cheng Xiechun, Liu Zhenqiu, Jin Chunlin, Ge Futian, Zhu Hegao, Xi Renfa, and Song Shixiang. Regarding the problem of relieving unemployed rickshaw pullers, the following was decided: Registration of unemployed rickshaw pullers will begin on the 22nd of this month and end on April 30. Issue a registration notice. Send a letter to the special district rickshaw puller office to introduce unemployed military pullers. The registration locations are designated as follows: A. Jianghuai Shanghai Association at the corner of Zhabei Zhongshan Road and Pushan Road; B. Nantong Association at No. 4, Yongji Lane, North Nicheng Bridge, Xizang Road; C. Jianghuai Association at the back door of Xinpuyu Hall, Huining Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>Notice of Registration Poor farmers from our hometown come to Shanghai to make a living, mostly with the aim of pulling rickshaws. However, due to the工部局's implementation of the rickshaw puller registration policy, it has already ended. All rickshaw pullers who have not been registered cannot pull rickshaws, and there is no opportunity to apply for registration, resulting in more and more unemployed rickshaw pullers gathering in Shanghai, wandering aimlessly, suffering from hunger and cold, and crying in vain. Our hometown associations have recently sent letters one after another, lamenting their plight and requesting relief, which is very pitiful. Therefore, we have established a joint office to first conduct registration of unemployed rickshaw pullers, so as to count the number of people, and then negotiate with the authorities as a basis for applying for registration and licenses. Moreover, the current number of licensed rickshaw pullers is insufficient to meet the demand, resulting in many vehicles being idle. It is indeed necessary to issue additional licenses and increase the number of rickshaw pullers. All our fellow villagers who urgently need to pull rickshaws but have no rickshaws to pull must come to register according to the dates and locations listed above (see above), so that they can have rickshaws to pull and will not wander in a foreign land. Please do not delay.</p>
<p>Precautions for Pulling Rickshaws When you are pulling a rickshaw, you must remember the street names and pay attention to the traffic lights on the road. Always listen to the instructions of the police to control traffic and abide by the road regulations. You cannot run in the middle of the road, you should walk close to the left side of the road. When pulling a rickshaw, you must form a single line and cannot run parallel with many vehicles. The rickshaw cannot be loaded with fish, meat, or vegetables, or other bulky items that may damage the rickshaw. If you want to turn, you must first extend your hand to make a sign to indicate the direction you are turning. When turning right, you cannot take a shortcut, you must make a large turn. Before stopping, you must raise your hand above your head to notify the vehicles behind. From night to dawn, you must light the rickshaw lamp. You cannot scramble for business, nor can you rush across the road to solicit business. If passengers leave items on the rickshaw, you must immediately send them to the nearest police station. When the car door cloth is not in use, it should be placed in the car compartment. The number painted on the car door cloth should be the same as the magnetic card number. After pulling a load, the soldiers should return the car to the car shop for washing.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Road Police at Nanxiang Station Crack Down on Forcing Women into Prostitution; Three Male Criminals Involved in the Case Were Escorted to Court Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The third section of the Su Song Police Department at Shanghai North Station, according to the police stationed at Nanxiang Station, cracked a case of trafficking in women and forcing women into prostitution involving two girls, Zeng Jine and Wang Fengxian, and three related criminals, Wu Zixiang, Wang Xiangxing, and Xu Huichuan. The two girls tearfully recounted their unfortunate experiences, which was extremely heartbreaking. Yesterday, the police section transferred them to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Two Girls Sold to the North as Prostitutes Wang Fengxian, a girl of 18 from Hangxian County, lost her parents early. Because she was not tolerated by her stepmother, an old woman from the same village and next door used the pretext of accompanying her to Shanghai to work as a helper and sold her to a Suzhou gang brothel on Zhejiang Road for $400. For the past three years, she has received guests every night, almost without exception. Recently, another Changzhou girl, Zeng Jine, who is now 18 years old, was working in Wuxi because her father was a farmer and the family was not well-off. A Wuxi woman saw that Zeng was a pretty little woman and was sweet-tongued, luring her to Shanghai. Colluding with ant-like matchmakers who trafficked in women, she also sold her to the same brothel as Wang. Later, Zeng realized that she had fallen into an evil trap and had been detained by the brothel, unable to escape. The two girls, Wang and Zeng, were given up for drowning. After a long time, they became fond of each other. In addition to smiling and accompanying the profligate guests and allowing them to insult and trample on them, they often covered their sleeves and wept secretly, discussing plans to jump out of the fire pit. The brothel, seeing that the two girls were young, secretly rejoiced and did not suspect that the two girls had other ideas. On the night of the 16th of this month, at about 9:00 PM, the two girls walked slowly in front of the three major companies as usual, pretending to seduce customers. While the police were chasing away street prostitutes, they suddenly ran away from the follower of the madam and hired a rickshaw to escape without a trace. They spent the night in a small hotel near the North Station. The next morning, they fled to Nanxiang again. The brothel waited until late at night without returning and quietly knew that there had been a change, and immediately forced Wu Zixiang, the witness who sold Zeng, to find someone to hand over. Wu was already old and powerless, so he invited one person named Xiangxing and one person named Xu Huichuan to help him. On the morning of the 17th, they met face to face at Nanxiang Station. So the two sides quarreled, and the stationed road police stepped forward to question them and learned all the details. After the criminals Wu Zixiang, 67 years old, from Anhui, Xiangyu, 68 years old, from Hubei, and Xu Huichuan, 52 years old, from Suzhou, were sent to the police section for verification, they confessed that there were more than a dozen human traffickers scattered in various places. The two girls, feeling sorry for their life experiences, shed tears and begged for relief. Yesterday morning, the Su Song Police Department Third Section prepared a letter and sent them to the Shanghai Local Court, requesting that all the criminals in the case be detained and brought to justice.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Son Kills Mother: Court Examines Corpse Yesterday; Both Trachea and Esophagus Were Cut with an Ax First and then a Knife; Many Items Were Stolen, Including the Funeral Clothes <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guanren (i.e., Xu Shengshi), the step-wife (i.e., remarried woman) of Chen Weizhong, a local resident living at No. 9 Jicheng Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, was murdered by her rebellious son Xu Maokun on the morning of the previous day at around 11:00 AM. He even dared to overturn a box of kerosene and set it on fire, intending to destroy the body and eliminate the evidence. Taking the opportunity, he rolled up his clothes and fled without a trace. Fortunately, the fire did not cause a disaster. When Chen Weizhong returned home at noon, he found Shengshi was killed under the bed and was greatly shocked. He immediately reported it to the police station, and the local guarantor Yan Liugen reported it to the Procuratorate of the Local Court for an autopsy. The appointed Prosecutor Liu Shiqing and Examiner Xuan Zhiming arrived at the scene for examination and confirmed that it was a death by homicide. They ordered that the coffin be prepared and wait for the arrest of the murderer, as reported yesterday. It is now known that after the incident, the police station recovered a firewood ax stained with blood, and the judge found a kitchen knife under the corpse with fresh blood on the blade. The official ordered the murder weapon to be taken back to the warehouse as proof that the firewood ax was used first, followed by the kitchen knife. Therefore, it was found that both the trachea and esophagus were cut. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Liu ordered Chen Weizhong, the corpse's husband, Xu Maode, the corpse's eldest son, Wang Heshi, a neighbor, and the guarantor to appear in court for detailed interrogation. As a result, he ordered them to leave and wait for instructions. According to Chen Weizhong, Xu Maokun is now 26 years old. He used to learn how to be a coppersmith, but he was deeply rooted in inferiority and could not be cultivated. He soon fled home. After the Shanghai War on January 28, the rebellious son did not know where to find a pistol. Before long, he committed a theft in the Public Concession and was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison. He has been in prison for more than three and a half years as of November 2 last year. His mother (i.e., the deceased) loved her son deeply and filed a petition for parole. He was released from prison and returned home. He usually helped his mother with housework. Although he was evil-minded, he did not show any disobedience to his mother. The mother and son did not have much ill-feeling. It is estimated that the rebellious son rolled away a handbag, two clothing bags, and bedding, etc. Even the funeral clothes of the deceased were stolen. From this, it is speculated that he may have been prepared for a long time. Now, he can only request a strict arrest of the rebellious son and bring him to justice. The deceased, Zhong Xueyun, etc. According to the end of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Maomao, the small owner of Zhang Longshun's leather box shop at the large pier in Nanshi, killed his friend Cai Fusheng with a knife in the bedroom upstairs, and then set fire to try to destroy the evidence. He was arrested after the case was discovered. At that time, it shocked the society. At the time of the Restoration, the murderer could not escape death and was eventually brought to justice. The circumstances of this case are similar, except that one is a friend and the other is his own mother, which is even more alarming.</p>

<p>Du Xi, Zi Kanghou, from Kunshan, residing at No. 2, Tianshun Lane, Mai Xi Yi Road, served as the Dean of Students at Songjiang County Normal School in 1929. Du developed a teacher-student love affair with Zhu Xinyi, a female student from Songjiang, and cohabited. On May 5, 1933, the two signed a marriage certificate by the West Lake. Later, Zhu learned that Du had not divorced his ex-wife, Wang Yinxu, and rented another residence. Du often did not return for several nights and gradually used up Zhu's savings of more than a thousand yuan. He also borrowed money from Zhu's mother. The feelings between the two gradually deteriorated. In April last year, Du took Zhu's own son out and sent a letter to Zhu, declaring that they were breaking up. Zhu then filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Shanghai Local Court. Soon, a settlement agreement was made, stating that the two parties would hold a legal wedding in Shanghai on New Year's Day this year. Before the wedding, they shall not break up on any pretext, and after the wedding, they shall not divorce on any pretext. Otherwise, one party shall compensate the other party for damages of 20,000 national currency. At that time, Zhu considered the old relationship and withdrew the complaint, continuing to cohabit with Du. On September 17 last year, Du suddenly left a long letter, saying that he would stop cohabiting from that day on. Zhu immediately filed a suit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, suing Du for paying damages of 20,000 yuan. On December 10, when the court summoned them for interrogation, the two parties reached a settlement record in court, with Du compensating Zhu for damages of 1,000 yuan, returning the borrowed money, and bearing the litigation costs. Zhu should raise her son Du Huan until he is eighteen years old and then hand him over to Du to take away. Although the settlement was reached in this case, Zhu has not yet obtained the damages she should have obtained, so she petitioned the court for enforcement. Yesterday, Judge Yang opened the enforcement court to summon Du Kanghou, the debtor, who claimed that if he handed over his son Du Huan for adoption, he could borrow money from relatives, but he would not be able to pay compensation. Please seal up my residence and office for auction. Zhu Xinyi, the creditor, said that if there is no money to enforce, do not seal up, please detain Du Kanghou, and stated the painful situation in the past, speaking with tears. The two sides argued for a long time. The court meeting was adjourned to the 27th for further summons for enforcement.</p>

<p>Bao Jianfu, a Chongming native and employee of the East Asia Bank on Sichuan Road, favored an outside lover, causing his wife, Ms. Hu, to feel resentful and unable to reconcile. They frequently quarreled. On the 11th of last month, they had another argument over a trivial matter. Ms. Hu secretly ingested opium in the morning with the intent to commit suicide. Her two sons, Zhigang and Zhijiong, also ingested poison in succession. Fortunately, they were discovered early, and all three lives were saved and fully recovered at the hospital. However, the police considered Ms. Hu's actions too cruel and filed charges of abetment to suicide. Details of the trial were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for the verdict. The defendant, Bao Hu, had previously been released to her husband, Bao Jianfu, after being reprimanded in court. She did not appear in court this time. Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special Court announced the verdict in the Eighth Tribunal, stating that Bao Hu was not guilty. The police's accusation of abetment to suicide was based on Bao Zhigang's written statement in the hospital. However, according to Bao Zhigang's testimony in court, his younger brother's ingestion of opium was not on his mother’s orders. Therefore, the charge of abetment to suicide could not be established.</p>

<p>Qin Weiye, managing director of the Tongyuan Bank on Tianjin Road, was about to go to work from his residence at the Lianzhuli alley entrance on Edinburgh Road on the morning of the 15th of last month. As soon as he boarded his car, kidnappers also got on the car, brandished a pistol, and threatened Qin and his driver, Wu Asheng, to remain silent and ordered them to drive off. Wu deliberately crashed into a passing trolleybus, causing the kidnappers to abandon their plan and flee. The Jing'an Temple police arrested several kidnappers, including Li Yizhi, and handed them over to the First Special District Court for investigation. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the scheduled date for the verdict. Investigating officers escorted the kidnappers to court at 9:00 AM. Judge Liu Yugui announced the verdict, sentencing Li Yizhi, Chen Yaonian, and Zhao Qinghong to 13 years of imprisonment each. Wang Shaoqing and Zhang Er were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment each. All kidnappers were deprived of their civil rights for 10 years. After the verdict, Li Xiaobin, deputy captain of the Detective Team of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrived in court and stated that Li Yizhi, Wang Shaoqing, and Chen Yaonian were involved in major cases of murder and robbery in the Chinese Concession and requested permission to take them away for investigation. The court stated that the deputy captain did not have official documents, and they were ordered to wait for the Municipal Public Security Bureau's official documents before further review. The five kidnappers were taken away by the investigating officers to be imprisoned.</p>

<p>Zhu Pingou, a staff member of the First Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, allegedly colluded with Zhou Xinglou, Peng Wu, and others, taking advantage of his position to defraud Ms. Qian Gu, a local woman, of 1,000 national currency units. After the victim found out and sought the return of her money, a balance of 830 yuan was still outstanding. Unable to recover the funds, a dispute arose. Zhu Pingou preemptively filed a lawsuit with the Procuratorate of the District Court, accusing Qian Gu of fraud and defamation. Prosecutor Xie Lian summoned the case for investigation and discovered that Zhu Pingou had committed fraud. He was prosecuted by law and indicted in the criminal court. As a result of the trial, Zhu Pingou was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and ordered to repay 830 silver dollars through a private lawsuit. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that when Zhou Xinglou testified in court, he was biased toward Zhu Pingou. After careful verification of his testimony by Judge Lu of the Criminal Court, Zhou Xinglou was suspected of joint fraud. The case was transferred to the Procuratorate for investigation. After a clear investigation by Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia, a public prosecution was filed by law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Xiangzu presided over the trial in the 13th Tribunal. Ms. Qian Gu and witness Jin Youxiang testified about the circumstances of the fraud. Zhou Xinglou, who was in custody, claimed that he introduced Peng Wu to Zhu Pingou, but knew nothing about the funds. The presiding judge considered the case clear and adjourned it. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Tragic Murder in a Dance Hall: Deep Hatred Between Two Servants: Jin A'mei Kills Fan Maodi <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Lishu Dance Hall at No. 26 Zhubao Third Road in the French Concession was established by Fan Shoutang (47 years old, from Jiading, six miles from Liuhe Town) after the January 28th Incident. The business was quite good, and most of the patrons were Western sailors. Fan's family also lived there. Fan's cousin, Fan Maodi, 19 years old, had been working as a servant in the dance hall for four years. He was usually mature, hardworking, and was well liked by his employer, which led to friction with Jin A'mei, a colleague from Caojiadu in Huxi, who was in his forties. Maodi usually slept in a small room on the third floor, while Jin slept on a makeshift bed in the dance hall after closing. Recently, Jin’s resentment towards Maodi deepened, leading Jin to suddenly want to kill Maodi. After getting up at 9:00 AM yesterday, Jin A'mei hid a sharp knife and rushed into Maodi's bedroom on the third floor, bolting the door from the inside. He then used the sharp knife to stab Maodi in the chest near the right nipple, and then stabbed his right thigh, right calf, left hand, and left thumb, a total of eleven times. Maodi was awakened from his sleep by the extreme pain and cried out for help, but he was too weak to resist and could only await death. People nearby heard the cries but did not think it was a murder, so they ignored it and did not offer help. It was not until 9:30 AM, when the mistress, Fan Hongshi (Fan Shoutang's 36-year-old wife), got up, that someone told her that they had heard Maodi shouting for help and that he might be fighting with someone. Hongshi told her husband, Fan Shoutang, who rushed to the third floor to check. The door was bolted from the inside by Jin, so he kicked it open with force. Inside, he saw Maodi’s bed covered in blood. He was barely breathing and on the verge of death. The murderer, Jin A'mei, was sleeping on the bed opposite Maodi's after committing the crime. Seeing the employer enter the room, he became alarmed and stabbed himself in the right thigh several times with the knife. The owner, Fan Shoutang, called the people downstairs to come upstairs. First, they seized the knife from Jin's hand, and then they telephoned the Maitland Police Station to send detectives to investigate. They attempted to send the injured Fan Maodi to the hospital, but it was too late. He died. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for an autopsy. The murderer, Jin A'mei, was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The detectives found the murder weapon on Jin's bed. It was reported that the knife was recently purchased. They also found the packaging paper and a suicide note stating his debts. The detectives took the shop owner, the chief steward Luo Baosheng, and the accounting clerk Xiao Zhou to the police station for interrogation. The body will be reported to the Second Special Court today for an autopsy. The deceased was said to be an only child. His mother died three years ago. His father, Fan Songyuan (50 years old), lives at No. 5 Rongqingfang, Jiu Mu Di, and is a foreign goods peddler.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Coal Industry Association Telegraphed Ministry of Finance to Order Xiamen Customs to Use Domestic Coal for Ships <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Minister Kong [Xiangxi] of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, esteemed Sir: According to a letter from the Xiamen Heping Company, the Customs has tendered bids for coal to be used by the inspection and engineering [巡工] ships under Xiamen Customs this year, and they intend to use foreign coal. The foreign coal receives a more favorable treatment by being exempted from import duties of more than four yuan. Our company feels deeply saddened upon hearing this. We know that your esteemed association speaks for the coal industry, promotes domestic coal, and spares no effort. Therefore, we report the facts in detail. Everyone knows that China's coal production is in surplus and that workers are unemployed. Both the government and the people have a duty to give priority to using domestic goods. Former Minister Song [Ziwen] set an example by limiting the use of foreign coal by Customs. The Customs should strive to uphold this principle and must not despise domestic coal, sit idly by while money flows abroad, and ignore the unemployment of workers. Furthermore, we found that there are also three or four domestic coal suppliers who bid for Xiamen Customs' coal besides foreign coal. The lowest price, including all domestic taxes, is no more than 18 yuan. Now, foreign coal is exempted from tariffs but still costs 17.2 yuan. If tariffs are added, the price is nearly 22 yuan. Why is the Customs not using inexpensive domestic coal and insists on using expensive foreign coal? Is it because foreign coal is unsuitable? Shanxi and Henan coal are comparable in quality to foreign coal. Both Xiamen and Shanghai Customs have used Shanxi coal for a year or two and have been satisfied. What is the reason for Xiamen Customs' sudden change of policy to purchase expensive foreign coal? We find it difficult to understand. Based on the above reasons, we do not know why the Inspection and Engineering Department made this decision. If it is to avoid tariffs of more than 4 yuan, then foreign coal is cheaper than domestic coal, so it must be purchased. If this speculation is correct, then all government agencies can follow suit, reducing national revenue and cutting off the livelihood of domestic coal. The impact will be enormous. Our company is concerned about the national economy and the people's livelihood and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we dare to send a letter to your esteemed association, asking you to uphold justice, forward it to party and government agencies, and ask them to prevent the use of foreign coal and select domestic coal for the benefit of the country.' Therefore, Customs is a tax revenue agency directly under the Ministry. If it abandons domestic coal and uses foreign coal, it violates the government's policy of promoting domestic coal. The impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood is enormous. We hereby telegraph, requesting your review and verification, and instructing Xiamen Customs to comply, select domestic coal to enrich the national economy. We await your reply. Shanghai Coal Industry Association respectfully presents."</p>

<h3 id="e133">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Organizes a Materials Purchasing Committee <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it is reported that the person in charge of the company's business department stated that the company has decided to organize a materials purchasing committee to handle the procurement of materials. The members of the committee will include the general manager, deputy general managers, department heads, the chief accountant, and one secretary. The general manager will serve as the chairman of the committee, and the two deputy general managers will serve as standing committee members. The committee has already started work and is drafting various regulations. It is expected that these measures will soon be implemented to ensure that the procurement of materials is rational and complies with economic principles. It is reported that the company's previous materials purchasing methods had many shortcomings. The most obvious is that the materials accounts within the company were not updated in a timely manner. In some cases, records had not been made for four months. At the same time, the quantity of materials recorded in the accounts was inconsistent with the actual quantity in stock. In such cases, the accounts are useless, and it is impossible to supervise the materials or check for irregularities. The company's material expenses, including fuel coal alone, reach about one million yuan per year, which is significant. Therefore, the establishment of the company's materials purchasing committee must, at a minimum, improve the materials bookkeeping system to achieve the goal of recording materials as they enter and exit, and to ensure that the accounts match the goods. It is reported that the purchasing committee has decided on the following purchasing principles: 1) Major materials: open bidding; 2) Temporary urgent and miscellaneous materials: open price inquiry and selective purchase. It is reported that General Manager Cai of the company is committed to making all aspects of the company's reorganization absolutely transparent, treating the company's problems step by step, and informing the public and employees of the root causes, so that they can contribute their opinions and cooperate sincerely to gradually realize the government's plan to reorganize the shipping industry.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Shen Bao,</p>
<p>We, the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, extend our sincerest apologies for an error in yesterday's special edition commemorating the second anniversary of the New Life Movement in Shanghai. The article "Mayor Wu's Practice of the New Life Movement" was incorrectly arranged, with sections appearing in the wrong order due to a typesetting error. We are reprinting the original text below for correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, February 19th</p>
<p>The New Life Movement, initiated by Chairman Chiang, has now been underway for two years. Deeply resonating with the needs of the era, it is rightly regarded as essential for national rejuvenation, fostering a positive trend and gaining widespread support throughout the country.</p>
<p>Looking back at China's recent history, various movements have sprung up successively. However, their impact has been limited, either to the advocacy of a few patriotic individuals, without being embraced by the general populace, or to momentary bursts of enthusiasm, lacking sustained momentum. The New Life Movement stands apart! It serves as the driving force for implementing new policies, revitalizing the nation, and advancing all cultural construction in China. The fundamental principles of the New Life Movement lie in the spirit of "if one day new, again new, daily new," and the resolve to treat "all things of the past as dead yesterday, and all things of the future as born today." Its aim is to sweep away all the entrenched vices and degenerate customs at the bottom of society, eradicate all the deeply rooted decadent habits in people's minds, and cultivate a new lifestyle of perseverance, integrity, and upward striving, so that the lives of people across the nation can become increasingly rational, scientific, productive, revolutionary, militarized, modernized, and artistic.</p>
<p>Life encompasses all human activities. It is the collective behavior of individuals and the nation to ensure survival, develop livelihoods, and propagate life. If the entire country, from officials to commoners, were rife with hypocrisy and corruption among officials, indifference and apathy among the people, decay and incompetence among adults, and depravity and indulgence among the youth, extravagance and superficiality among the wealthy, and baseness and chaos among the poor, then how could we hope to rectify national discipline, maintain social order, and achieve the liberation and revitalization of the entire nation? Therefore, transforming our lifestyle is not only crucial for reversing the tide of decadence and inspiring the people but also serves as the driving force for national rejuvenation, implementing new policies, and building all aspects of our culture.</p>
<p>Examining past movements for national salvation and reform, the reason they ultimately failed to achieve their goals lies in their impracticality and disregard for fundamentals. The implementation of any system is closely related to social customs and the habits of the people. China's past education and politics have been plagued by hypocrisy and a lack of practicality, resulting in ineffective laws, useless skills, and incompetent machinery. Even with identical official positions, efficiency varies; with identical skills, achievements differ; and with identical machinery, functionality is inconsistent. Therefore, after any nation undergoes reform and renewal, it must be influenced by customs and transformed by education for its governance to succeed. The effect of changing customs and habits is significantly greater, its application significantly broader, and its need significantly more urgent than that of political education. The New Life Movement is the central effort to change customs, inspire the people, and advance the nation's destiny. It is also the fundamental movement for national revival that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>However, the success of this movement depends on the self-awareness and self-reliance of the people throughout the country. Only by setting an example can we extend it to others, spread it nationwide, create a prevailing trend, and form the strength of the era. Our nation has always been a land of propriety and righteousness, and the teachings of the ancient sages have long been admired by all nations. Yet, today, we still see the collapse of the four virtues (propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame) and the deterioration of discipline. Foreign countries even openly use terms like "unorganized" and "uncivilized" as a source of ridicule and scorn. This is not due to the ignorance of the Chinese people but to the empty words and arrogance of later generations who fail to practice what they preach.</p>
<p>Therefore, the essence of the New Life Movement lies in action, not empty words. The key to the success of the New Life Movement lies in the practice of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, not in various forms of propaganda.</p>
<p>Wang Yangming, a great Confucian scholar of his time, deeply understood the root causes of our people's problems and created the doctrine of the unity of knowledge and action. He said:</p>
<p>"The true and genuine understanding of knowledge is action; the clear and precise observation of action is knowledge."</p>
<p>"There is no knowledge without action; knowledge without action is merely not knowing."</p>
<p>"Sagehood is a single endeavor; knowledge and action cannot be separated into two things."</p>
<p>"Knowledge is the beginning of action, and action is the completion of knowledge!"</p>
<p>Yan Yuan (Xizhai) and Li Gong (Nugu), living at the end of the Ming Dynasty, also advocated the doctrine of action to stem the tide of chaos. Yan said:</p>
<p>"When a person studies, the thoughts in their mind and the words they speak, even if they have a thousand or a hundred meanings, are not as practical as putting one principle into practice."</p>
<p>"Better to be real in one end and one section than to be virtual in the whole body and great use."</p>
<p>"We should only put effort into practice, not into words and writing. Confucius's book is named 'Analects'; try to observe what the disciples recorded, and every sentence is about action."</p>
<p>"There is no other way to read books; just put effort into the word 'action.' For example, when reading 'he is filial and fraternal,' then strive to be filial and fraternal."</p>
<p>His disciple, Li Gong, continued his aspirations and also said:</p>
<p>"The classics are the register of virtue and skill, intended to promote practice, not to be read idly." Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the New Life Movement, I am honored to be asked by this association to contribute this humble piece. I am ashamed of my inadequacy and fear that this fundamental movement for national salvation and revival will repeat the mistakes of empty words of the past. Therefore, I offer these words in the hope of mutual encouragement. The success of the New Life Movement and the fate of the Chinese nation in the future depend solely on the actions of the Chinese people from now on!</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Paper Manufacturing Industry in Shanghai (Continued) (A Survey of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 14) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information</p>
<p>3.  Current Status of Paper Mills in Shanghai</p>
<p>Among the modern paper mills currently existing in Shanghai, the larger ones include Longzhang, Tianzhang, and about six or seven others. Their history and current status are described separately below for reference by all sectors:</p>
<p>1.  Longzhang Machine Paper Company. Longzhang was established in the thirty-second year of Guangxu (1906) and is the third oldest paper mill in China. The factory is located at No. 5 Longhua Road, Shanghai, and the distribution office is at No. 17 Xinyongan Street. It is a joint-stock company. The current general manager is Mr. Pang Laichen, and the major shareholders are Messrs. Liu Baisen, Chuan Xiaoan, and Pang Zanchen. Pang Laichen is also a major shareholder. According to the company's previous registration with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, its capital was 343,000 taels of silver. The factory increased its capital once in 1933, but the exact amount is unknown. According to industry insiders, the total capital is about 1 million national currency. The company's factory buildings cover more than 20 mu of land and have two paper machines. Electricity is supplied by the factory itself. It employs more than 400 male and female workers. The factory focuses on manufacturing maobian paper and lian shi paper, using the double dragon as a trademark, specifically for printing and packaging by various stores. It is said that the monthly output is 300 to 400 pieces, and the annual turnover reaches about 1 million yuan. Two years ago, due to the Ministry of Finance increasing tariffs and the high price of foreign Daolin paper, Chinese factories had the opportunity to imitate it. The company ordered a Daolin paper machine from abroad, which was installed and put into operation in July last year. The Daolin paper of various weights produced is of excellent quality, comparable to imported products. It is sold through agents, with a price of 65 cents per pound. The factory's sales in other areas were previously mainly in North China, but now mainly in Central China.</p>
<p>2.  Tianzhang Paper Mill. Tianzhang has two factories, East and West, which were formed by the merger of the former Lunzhang and Huazhang factories, as mentioned earlier. Lunzhang was originally founded by Mr. Li Hongzhang. In 1925, due to losses, it was merged into Tianzhang's West Factory. Before the merger, Yezhang had changed hands several times. In 1915, it was jointly operated by Chinese and Russian merchants, and later transferred to the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation. In 1920, it was taken over by Liu Baisen and others and renamed Baoyuan Paper Mill. In 1925, it was renamed Tianzhang East Factory. Tianzhang initially had a capital of 400,000 taels of silver, which was later increased to 600,000 taels. When taels were abolished and replaced with yuan, it was increased to 800,000 national currency. The East Factory is located at Lujiazui in Pudong, and the West Factory is located at Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. The general distribution office is located at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Sijing Road. It is a joint-stock company. Liu Baisen, Wang Xianhua, Liu Mengjing, Liu Zhongkai, Wang Xiaofen, and others are directors of the factory. It stopped production last year due to some events. After resuming production, it was renamed Tianzhang Changji. The East and West Factories both rent land to build factory buildings. The East Factory's base is more than 40 mu, with more than 60 factory buildings and warehouses. The factory has three wire paper machines, two Yangke paper machines, six beater machines, three digesters, one pulper, and one 500-horsepower steam engine, and five boilers. However, in 1933, a fire destroyed two machines. The factory purchased a calendering machine and a paper machine, equipped with an 85-horsepower motor, which was a German product and unique to the factories, worth about 120,000 yuan. The West Factory's base is about seven or eight mu, with one wire paper machine, two digesters, seven beater machines, and other paper machines and equipment, all of which are very complete. The two factories usually employ about 300 workers and more than 20 staff members. The factory's products include Daolin paper, imitation paper, No. 2 paper, husband paper, lian shi paper, and maobian paper, using the flying boat as a trademark. The East Factory produces coarse goods, such as yarn wrapping paper and secondary newspaper paper, with a daily output of 11,000 to 12,000 pounds to 15,000 to 16,000 pounds, and an annual output of 3.5 million to 3.6 million pounds. The West Factory originally manufactured Daolin paper, but later transformed to lian shi paper and maobian paper. Now it focuses on the manufacture of Daolin paper and imitation paper, which are widely sold. The daily output is 30,000 pounds, and the annual output is 7.5 million to 7.6 million pounds. The factory's products are mostly sold in Shanghai (major bookstores are its important customers), followed by Central and South China.</p>
<p>3.  Jiangnan Paper Company. Jiangnan was founded in 1925, at a time when the boycott of Japanese goods was in full swing. The factory's Chinese paper, such as lian shi, maobian, and haiyue, had the opportunity to develop, but the output was not large. After the new machines were purchased, the anti-Japanese goods trend had passed. When the January 28th Incident broke out, the factory's products replaced Japanese goods and began to make huge profits (at that time, the daily shipments increased from 30 to 40 pieces to 200 pieces, which was still not enough to distribute). The main directors of the factory are Wu Yaoting, Yu Qiaqing, Sun Hongfen, and Zhang Jichen. The director and manager is Mr. Zheng Shouzhi. It is a limited company. The main factory is located at Guangfu Road, north of Caojiadu Creek, and the branch factory is located in Gaozi Zengkezhou (specializing in the production of reed pulp for the main factory). The office is located at No. 38 Avenue Edward VII. The factory's products use the Fortune and Prosperity (Fu Lu) as a trademark, and their quality is comparable to Japanese goods. The sales network covers the entire country. The factory's reed pulp, which is its raw material, is its patented invention. The Gaozi branch factory purchased 4,000 mu of land to cultivate and manufacture it, using the Three Rings as a trademark. The equipment of the main and branch factories is described below for reference:</p>
<p>Land base: The factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai, purchased a base of 18 mu, 4 fen, and 3 li. The Gaozi branch factory has a base of more than 100 mu, and also purchased more than 4,000 mu of reed land in Zengkezhou.</p>
<p>Buildings: In Shanghai, there is a three-story office building, a material warehouse, two selection rooms, one pressing room, one cooking room, one pulping room, two paper-making rooms, two cutting and finishing rooms, one packaging room, a product warehouse, a steam power room, all built with foreign pine and galvanized iron. In addition, there are water storage pools, a total water tower, a bleaching powder dissolution pool, a glue storage pool, an iron workshop, a woodworking shop, an electrical transformer room, an electrical switch room, a workers' dining room, a gatekeeper's room, and a 113-foot cement chimney. In the Gaozi branch factory, in addition to the boiler room, there are seven factory buildings, also made of foreign pine and galvanized iron, which are very strong.</p>
<p>Machines: The main paper-making machines in the factory now include one 100-inch round steel Yangke machine, two 65-inch round steel Yangke machines, two 12-inch diameter high-pressure digesters, eight Hollander beaters, two 30-foot long Lancashire boilers, sixteen German and French-made electric motors, totaling 400 horsepower, one large cooling machine with 150 horsepower (and one small machine, which is used for testing samples and is now used to manufacture coarse paper), and a large artesian well with a diameter of 12 and a half inches and a depth of 500 feet, equipped with a high-pressure air-cooled water pump, which produces more than 1 million gallons of water per day. There is also one 16-foot lathe, one 8-inch lathe, one 12-foot planer, and various tools such as drilling machines and pliers, three elevators, and 1,500 feet of small railway for loading and transporting goods. The Gaozi branch factory is equipped with one 28-foot long Lancashire boiler, one 5,000-watt electric light machine, one 48-horsepower steam engine, three 12-inch diameter high-pressure digesters, one towing machine, one rotary sawing machine, one four-roller calender, one shearing machine, one screening and cleaning machine, two belt conveyors, one bucket conveyor, two hydraulic reed pulp machines, and one hydraulic baling machine. The total value of the machines in the main and branch factories is very large.</p>
<p>In 1928, in order to develop, the company decided at the third shareholders' meeting to increase its capital in two phases: the first phase was to increase the capital by 600,000 yuan, combined with the original capital of 400,000 yuan, to form 1 million yuan. After the expansion, it planned to add a 65-inch paper machine to the Shanghai main factory to continue to imitate the production of domestic lian shi paper and maobian paper. It also planned to add three digesters and two pulping machines to the Gaozi branch factory to manufacture reed pulp, and to purchase 10,000 mu of reed land in Gaozi to produce more reeds! The second phase was to add 1 million yuan to form 2 million yuan, and to install two new paper machines and electrical equipment in the Gaozi branch factory to manufacture newspaper paper, glazed paper, Daolin paper, and wrapping paper. After the plan was proposed, many outsiders supported it. It is said that several hundred thousand yuan of the 600,000 yuan to be raised in the first step have already been raised.

<p>The Ministry of Education announced that the curriculum standards for junior and senior high schools have been in effect for more than three years. Recently, based on the opinions of the secondary education research associations of various provinces and cities and other parties, experts in various fields, and experienced middle school teachers and staff, a meeting was held at the Ministry of Education to discuss the revision of the middle school curriculum standards. As a result of the discussion, it was generally agreed that the teaching subjects and class hours should be slightly changed, and the content of the curriculum standards should also be revised. In addition, editing outlines for each subject should be added to make teaching more concrete. Based on this resolution, the Ministry of Education revised the table of teaching subjects and weekly class hours for each subject in each semester for junior and senior high schools and announced it on the 18th of this month for implementation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Ministry of Education promulgated the curriculum standards for kindergartens and elementary schools in October 1932, and schools across the country have implemented these curriculum standards for three years. Recently, based on the implementation status in various provinces and cities and the research results of the Elementary Education Research Association, the Ministry of Education convened multiple elementary education experts in October 1935 to hold a symposium on elementary school curriculum standards. The results of the association's research indicated that the elementary school curriculum still needed some revision. The total number of teaching hours at all levels was too high, and the burden on students was slightly too heavy, which has some impact on their physical health. The categories of subjects in the lower grades are quite numerous, making learning difficult to concentrate. In addition, there is a lot of repetition in one or two subjects, such as hygiene and nature, physical education and music. Based on the research results of the association, the Ministry of Education has held several meetings in recent times to discuss and decide to revise the entire curriculum. The main points of the revision of the elementary and middle school curriculum have been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. The revised table of teaching hours is recorded below:</p>
<p>Table of Teaching Subjects and Weekly Class Hours for Each Subject in Each Semester in Junior High Schools (Revised and Announced on the 18th of the Year 25 of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>1. Physical education and Boy Scouts each account for two hours within the four hours. Boy Scouts have an additional hour of extracurricular training.</p>
<p>2. In the third year, depending on local conditions, labor, library, and music may be reduced by four hours, and vocational subjects may be added.</p>
<p>Table of Teaching Subjects and Weekly Class Hours for Each Subject in Each Semester in Senior High Schools (Revised and Announced on the 18th of the Year 25 of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>Starting from the second year, credit hours are divided into Group A and Group B. Group A has six hours per week in both the second and third years (its level is equivalent to the content of the old standard's arithmetic curriculum). Group B has three hours per week in both the second and third years (its level should be reduced compared to Group A according to separately determined standards). However, Group B must add three hours of Chinese in the first semester of the second year, three hours of logic in the second semester, and three hours of English in the first and second semesters of the third year. The numbers in parentheses in the table indicate the hours for the subjects added by the two groups separately.</p>
<p>Schools may, depending on local conditions, set up simple vocational subjects (such as commerce, accounting, bookkeeping, statistics, application, clerical typing, arts, cooperatives, etc.) starting from the third year. Students who add subjects from Group A or Group B in the preceding paragraph may be exempt from the subjects added by the respective group in the third year.</p>
<p>Schools may set up domestic science subjects for female students. Female students who select subjects from Group B in the preceding paragraph may be exempt from the subjects added by Group B in the second or third year and select domestic science subjects for the same number of hours.</p>
<p>Library and music classes are taught in rotation every two weeks, one hour each time.</p>
<p>Summary Table of Elementary School Subjects and Weekly Teaching Hours (Revised and Announced on February 18, 1936)</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p>Civic training is different from other subjects and focuses on regular training. The table lists the group training time, which is 10 minutes per day (incorporated into morning meetings and other gatherings).</p>
<p>Social studies and nature in the lower and middle grades are combined into a general knowledge subject, including some knowledge of hygiene (hygiene habits are incorporated into civic training).</p>
<p>Starting from the fourth grade, the arithmetic subject adds teaching of abacus calculation.</p>
<p>Social studies in the upper grades can be divided into civics (civic knowledge), history, and geography. The time allocation is: civics: 30 minutes, history: 90 minutes, geography: 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Nature in the upper grades includes some knowledge of hygiene (habits are incorporated into civic training).</p>
<p>Fine arts and labor in the lower grades are combined into a work subject, and music and physical education are combined into a singing and games subject.</p>
<p>Total time: Schools may reduce 30 or 60 minutes per week depending on local conditions.</p>
<p>Time allocation: Based on the principle of 40 minutes per class, the duration may be extended to 45 or 60 minutes depending on the nature of the subject.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Ministry of Education Issues a Circular Restricting Schools from Collecting Application Fees <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Elementary schools and kindergartens are not allowed to collect fees.</p>
<p>Middle schools: half a yuan, vocational schools: one yuan.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) The Ministry of Education believes that schools in various places collect registration fees from new students without any restrictions, and many even misuse the funds without reporting them, making auditing difficult. In order to correct these abuses, it has formulated measures to restrict the collection of registration fees by schools at all levels and issued a circular to various departments on the 19th to instruct them to comply with the following key points: Elementary schools and kindergartens are not allowed to collect registration fees at all. The registration fee charged by middle schools should not exceed half a yuan in national currency, and the registration fee charged by vocational schools and above should not exceed one yuan. Registration fees should be used exclusively for the expenses of refreshments and meals for examinees. Advertising costs and test paper expenses should be paid from the school's office expenses during school holidays. Full-time teachers should not be paid separately for grading papers. Part-time teachers whose salaries are not calculated on a twelve-month basis may be given travel expenses at the discretion of the provincial and municipal education departments to ensure consistency. These expenses should be paid from the school's office expenses.</p>

<p>Ling and Wang, the new principals, issue a circular to teachers, staff, and students to return to school.</p>
<p>The male teachers are already in Beiping. The female teachers are also looking for a school site in Beiping.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) Education in Tongxian has been in a state of stagnation since Yin Rugeng's independence. According to sources from Tongzhou this morning (18th), the Jidong Autonomous Government recently formally announced Ling Ziping and Wang Ruishu as the principals of the Tongxian Normal Schools for Boys and Girls and issued a circular to the teachers, staff, and students of the former schools, urging them to return to school quickly. The reopening of the schools is scheduled for the end of this month, but most of the students of both schools are not in Tongxian and have already come to Beiping to find accommodation in order to resume classes. The situation of the two schools is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Tongxian Normal School for Boys, after the Jidong Incident, received an order from the Ministry of Education to suspend classes on the 12th of last year and move to Beiping. Now, after days of preparation, the school has found the old site of the Northeast Middle School in Pi Zi Hutong as its school building. Starting at 8:00 this morning (18th), classes officially resumed. The school has a total of nine classes, with 305 students. Except for more than ten students who have applied for a temporary postponement of registration due to the long distance, the remaining 280 students have returned to school from their hometowns to attend classes. According to Wan Shou, the principal of the school, who spoke to reporters this morning, in addition to the undergraduate students, the school also has an affiliated elementary school dedicated to students' practice. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, the number of students in the affiliated elementary school for normal school students to practice must account for a quarter of the total number. The affiliated elementary school has a total of ten classes in the junior and senior grades, with 450 students. Currently, some of the senior students have written to request the restoration of the affiliated elementary school, but the Department of Education intends to close the affiliated elementary school in order to save expenses. The school's previous monthly operating expenses were 6,200 yuan. The expenses for October since the incident have not yet been received, and only half of the expenses for December have been received. It is heard that the Department of Finance intends to issue half of the regular expenses in the future. However, this matter is being negotiated by the Director of the Department of Education, Li Jinzao, with the Department of Finance. The intention of the Department of Education is to strive to restore the original amount and restore the original classes to comfort the displaced students.</p>
<p>The Hebei Provincial Tongxian Normal School for Girls, since moving from Tongxian to Beiping with the Normal School for Boys, has not been able to resume classes due to the lack of a school building. Some of the students of the school are currently living in hotels and relatives' homes and have written to urge the school authorities to find a solution quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle John has been working at Mr. Lao's company all along. One of Mr. Lao's shareholders said that his concern for conscience in business was almost excessive, and he was beyond reproach in everything else. Another person said that money was not enough to repay Uncle John for his loyalty. Finally, what old daddy said showed his highest character. Once Uncle John was handling a matter at someone's place and later discovered that the person was trying to cheat and wanted Uncle to help him cheat. Uncle refused, even though the person offered him a high salary. He was not moved. The person was angry and said, 'If you stick to that principle, you will not succeed in business.' But Uncle retorted, 'Anyway, I never want to think about abandoning them to achieve success,' and left the job, preferring to take a harder and more difficult position."</p>
<p>"Good—Good!" Several students shouted in unison, because their mood at that time was most suitable for understanding and cherishing that story.</p>

<p>"He's not rich."</p>
<p>"He never did anything earth-shattering, did he?"</p>
<p>"He didn't."</p>
<p>"He's just good?"</p>
<p>"But nothing else," Fu Lang answered honestly, secretly wishing that Uncle John had indeed done something to be proud of, because Xie Ke was clearly disappointed after hearing that answer.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Securities: All Spot Transactions Suspended <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>22 Customs Rose the Most</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the layoff suspension the day before, added margin. The morning session did not open until almost 10:30 AM, too late. The market announced that only one session would be held in the afternoon. Those who failed to fully submit spot goods for the next day must complete the settlement within one day. New short sellers, even if they have spot goods, are not allowed to sell them. Spot trading on the market is also temporarily suspended. What is even more strange is that buying in the morning session and selling in the next session is also not allowed. The total amount of exchange accounts in the past three days has only decreased by several million compared to the 62 million. Currently, all of the outstanding short positions of 5 million have been deposited in the exchange. The February futures contract has only four days left. Most of the short positions are hedging preparations for delivery. The long position camp cannot be investigated. It is hoped that it will not shake again, so as to avoid drastic changes in market prices again. Yesterday, both sessions saw an upward trend, with No. 43 covering the most short positions. The first session rose by 45 jiao to one yuan, but the unified tax fell by two jiao. In the next session, the 22 Customs unexpectedly surged by one yuan and three jiao, for a total increase of two yuan and two jiao. The discount was 63, and the difference with Ding was only one li. This was due to the forced covering of floating short positions yesterday, resulting in this competition for chips. As a result, market prices rose across the board, ranging from 35 jiao to the maximum of two yuan and two jiao for 22 Customs. The total transaction volume was 9.45 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>

<p>Dozens of New High Prices Reached</p>
<p>Xin Feng Yang Hang reported that yesterday (18th) speculators frantically bought steel stocks, forgetting the decision on the Tennessee Valley Electricity Case. According to Dow Jones estimates, steel production is now 53%, one percent higher than last week. Also, with the increase in automobile production and the promising prospects for railways, buying interest is unusually strong. As a result, the overall market advanced, and the industrial stock index rose to a new high since 1931. Public utilities rebounded from low prices, which was quite confusing. Railroad stocks rose due to increased freight and good 1935 earnings reports. Automobiles and auto parts were very strong. Airline stocks rose to new highs. Railway materials and metallurgical stocks rose. In total, dozens of new high prices were reached. Small exchanges and price markets also rose. The total trading volume for the day was 3.53 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market is ordinary and utterly devoid of brilliance. The range of ups and downs for the whole day is between four and five jiao. The revolving force is extraordinarily intense, but sellers argue that the inventory of yarn in the warehouses continues to increase. It is especially difficult to sell this cotton yarn for a while. The amount of sales has remained unchanged, but the spot yarn sales market is still maintaining.</p>
<p>Marginal Fluctuations in Marked Yarn</p>
<p>The opening of the marked yarn market in the morning was flat and weak, and the situation became more and more sluggish. As the chips in the warehouse gradually increased, reaching more than 27,000 packages, the pressure on the yarn market was very heavy. However, the bulls were also sluggish and did not move. As a result, the market price was gloomy. As a result, each month fell two, three, and five jiao from the closing price of the previous day. The opening in the afternoon heard that there were still more than 2,000 packages of spot yarn transactions. Osaka Sanpin yarn saw ups and downs, rising and falling three, four, and five jiao. The first session rose three, four, and five jiao, and the second and third sessions turned downstream. As a result, each month rose one and two jiao from the morning closing price. It was found that Da Ji sold 1,300 packages, and there were 500 packages remaining.

<p>The cotton market is dull and weak due to the sluggish trend of English cotton. However, market transactions are particularly bleak.

<p>Yesterday, US cotton opened with each month rising or falling by 1 to 2 points. Most of the trading in the market was for longs in March to close out and move to distant months. Afterwards, some people bought at limit prices, and there were not many sellers. Industry members and the Bombay gang bought January, and the market situation was firm.

<p>Flour Market Feels More Unsupported</p>
<p>The flour market traded lightly yesterday, and fewer people arrived at the market due to rain. Both buyers and sellers had no interest in competing. Furthermore, foreign reports showed declines, and sales to customers were sluggish. Major players outside the industry followed the market and started selling aggressively, but there were few buyers. The market felt more unsupported. The opening price in the morning was lowered by 2 to 3 fen. In the afternoon, it was briefly supported by short covering, but ultimately customer stockpiles were sluggish, and there were more sellers than buyers.

<p>The wheat market rose and fell inconsistently yesterday. The recent market remained optimistic due to the scarcity of spot wheat. The distant months reported lower prices for foreign wheat and were the new wheat standard. Stockpiles were hesitant to fully receive. Yesterday, due to the poor situation of foreign wheat, the standard flour market has already stepped down, which triggered competitive selling from many floating positions and mainland gangs. As a result, the market stepped down in a bloody trend. However, this month is still being held up by spot goods. Spot wheat arrivals yesterday were still scarce, and car wheat was still priced at around 5 yuan and 3 jiao. Factories held firm and did not buy.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the source from various gangs arrived more than 60, (goods a total of more than 13,000 shi) The sales in this street are normal, the packaging is still not comfortable. Qingdao and Yantai gangs only handled about 2,000 packages, so at this time of strong arrivals and weak sales, the market situation turned tired. As a result, Su Tong japonica rice prices went down slightly by 5 fen, and thin rice fell by 1 jiao. Only Nangang early rice was barely standing due to the scarcity of goods. The supply and demand of Du Yang pointed rice and Yinbian Yuan were similar, and there was still no rise or fall.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 32-33 ships from various gangs arrived in the river. The sales of various goods on the market, white japonica rice, Yang Du pointed rice, Yinbian Yuan thin rice are still being sold, but Ke pointed rice is still stagnant. The market situation of various goods is extremely stable.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Sugar Market: Immediately Loaded Dutch Raw White Down by a Jiao or So <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Quanzhou Red and White Sugar Not Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. The association's price was 22 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen for spot goods of 24 Dutch raw white, and 7 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen for re-export, with no change. Dong Red and White were both called at the original price and not traded. Zhenji No. 1 of this factory's refined white was 21 yuan and 4 jiao, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were returned as before, with no rise or fall. However, the price of immediately loaded Dutch raw white was loosened by a jiao or so. Da Chang sold 100 tons at a price of 3 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen and 5 li Dutch shields, a slight decrease of 1 jiao, 2 fen, and 5 li compared to the previous price. Hao goods, Chao Gang, Chao Qing still held firm and were unwilling to weaken. Min Gang and Hua Red slightly opened, priced at 12 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, with no significant rise or fall. The Quanzhou red and white sugar that arrived a few days ago was priced twice before and yesterday, but the difference with the middle range price was far. Inquiries were made to the cargo owner by telegram, but the reply was that it was not exchangeable, so the trade was not completed.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company again reached the deadline for bids yesterday. 2,081 packages of Five Sheep raw white were priced at 22 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen, and 120 packages were traded. Nos. 2, 4, and 5 Five Sheep refined white were bid at the original price and not traded.</p>
<h3 id="e175">North and South Goods: Xiamen Orange Cakes Have Continued to Arrive <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen orange cakes have been scarce recently because Wenzhou goods have been cutting in, because the cost is difficult to match. It was heard yesterday that the Hao Fang has already transported 24 pieces. If the cake blanks are soft, hot, and the color is ruddy, it can be sold. It was found that the previous price was 23 yuan and 8 jiao, and there may be a hope of rising. Shantou orange cakes have also arrived less recently. The Hao goods are called 28 yuan, the stock is limited, and the trend is difficult to loosen.</p>

<p>Haikou cowhide has been scarce recently. Red leather, such as sand red leather and red water Qing Hao goods, are all out of stock. White leather is showing a tired trend because it is not a current sales order. White water Qing ordinary opened at 38 yuan, and more than ten pieces were traded. Shui Ting leather was called 30 yuan and was not traded, a slight decrease of 1 to 2 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Silk Industry in the Past Year <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Tianyu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>After the economic panic of 1929 spread throughout the world, people's purchasing power generally declined. This was followed by a sharp drop in prices and a decline in trade. Various production and consumption rates around the world also declined, with raw materials being the most affected. Silk is one of the raw materials, and it was naturally hit in the same way. However, because it is not a necessity, the rate of decline exceeded that of most raw materials. From 1929 to 1933, the silk trade rate fell by 74%, the silk fabric trade rate fell by 63%, the production rate fell by 11% from 1929 to 1934, and the consumption rate fell by 29%, resulting in the world's silk reserves increasing from 9.1 thousand tons in 1929 to 17.3 thousand tons in 1934. This was a new era in the history of the world, and Japan, the world's largest silk supplier, was busy limiting production in order to save silk prices and make up for the losses of domestic silkworm farmers. China is a country that lags behind in everything. Today, when the world silk market is entirely in the hands of the Japanese, the impact it receives is of course not just the economic panic. In addition to the dumping of Japanese silk and the surge in rayon giving it a major threat, it also suffers from the unparalleled pain of cheap gold and expensive silver due to the exchange rate between countries. According to customs reports, the silk export volume in 1934 was only more than 54,000 dan, and the lowest price of medium-grade factory silk in the Shanghai foreign market was 460 yuan per dan. As a result, only ten silk factories in Shanghai were open at the end of the year, with only about 2,000 silk reeling machines. Such an unprecedented order form has turned many lush mulberry forests in the country into cultivation areas for other crops. Although there has been government advocacy and management, and people's efforts to improve, it still feels deeply painful and difficult to achieve results in a short time.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In the first half of 1935, the silk market carried on the low-level trend of the previous year. Except for the first half of January, when overseas spring sales moved slightly and demand increased, the silk prices in the United States, Britain, France, and Japan rose in unison. Domestic silk factories also purchased a lot to replenish spring raw materials. At one time, silk prices were quite tight. In the Shanghai foreign market, the price of medium-grade factory silk once rose to 550 yuan per dan. However, the Chinese silk market continued to decline due to Japanese silk dumping, cheap gold and expensive silver, and relaxed exchange rates. After the US recovery movement was declared dead by the court in late May, it became even more depressed. By the end of June, the average price of medium-grade factory silk was only 420 yuan per dan, setting a new record that has not been seen recently. However, since July in the second half of the year, due to the slight economic recovery in the world, silk sales increased sharply. Furthermore, due to the reduction in silk production, inventories were scarce, which caused silk prices to gradually become firm. New York, London, Lyon, Yokohama and other ports all rose in unison. Among them, Lyon was inferior due to political unrest and other reasons in France, but the silk prices opened in other places in October have all exceeded the average monthly price in 1933. The Shanghai silk market also rose sharply. The price of high-grade factory silk once broke through the 1,000 yuan mark. Based on the data recorded in the Silk Statistics Monthly Report, the silk prices in the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and Shanghai, China in 1935 are recorded below:</p>

<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>In 1936, everyone shouted loudly! Shouting about the extraordinary period! But the strong also shouted about the extraordinary year! Their extraordinary is the extraordinary preparation period! Extraordinary period of aggression! And for the weak, it is just an extraordinary period of grievance, an extraordinary period of land loss, an extraordinary period of pain! To save decline! To deal with 1936, then only everyone should work hard to use the national products movement!</p>
<p>Using the national products movement! Or it may be a movement to save the country and survive! We must firmly adhere to the Three Noes Principles. In this life-and-death moment of the "Citizens Using National Products Year", the so-called Three Noes Principles are:</p>
<p>"Do not" use non-national products</p>
<p>"Do not" eat non-national products</p>
<p>"Do not" wear non-national products</p>
<p>If they are not national products, don't even look at them! Otherwise, they have the seductive power of a beauty! The legal currency in your own wallet will disappear without a trace. The author hopes that in this emergency, everyone will make sufficient efforts in the "Using National Products Movement"!</p>

<h3 id="e179">Dispatching Warships to Nanyang and National Products Exhibition <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The love of national products and the enthusiastic mood of Nanyang overseas Chinese are even greater than that of people in the country. However, they suffer from being separated by a vast ocean and do not know how the crafts of the motherland have progressed. They do not know what the quality and texture of the products are. Many overseas Chinese still measure the national products of the motherland with the eyes of twenty or thirty years. This is all because the overseas Chinese do not fully know the recent situation of national products. Therefore, there must be a large-scale national products exhibition in various parts of Nanyang, so that the general overseas Chinese can see and hear, and truly know the true national products in order to recognize the true national products. Recently, some Chinese people have seen this. Whenever there is an opportunity, they must transport national product samples to the exhibition. Recently, there has also been the organization of a Nanyang Business Inspection Group, so that domestic and foreign lovers of national products can unite and help each other. This is indeed a good work in the recent history of national products. However, the Nanyang region is vast. If it is fixed in one place, it will inevitably take a long time, lack sensitive functions, and will not be easily effective. I once talked with Mr. Xu, and Mr. Xu believes that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should open a special ship to collect domestic products from the country, exhibit them on the ship, and invite local overseas Chinese to visit the ship in each place, and explain them and provide them with convenience. The visitors will feel like they have returned to their homeland and will be overjoyed. How great is its effectiveness? I have accumulated this idea for a long time, but I have not had the opportunity to practice this statement. Recently, the Shanghai National Products Movement Federation held a meeting, and someone suggested that the central government recently sent warships to Nanyang to comfort the overseas Chinese. Why not take this opportunity to collect products from various national product factories and hold a national product exhibition on the ship, so that the government can show the overseas Chinese the true face of the national products in addition to comforting them. Then the patriots will naturally think of admiring the motherland, and those who like to use national products will be happy to buy national products. I know that the government authorities have been recently encouraging national products and spare no effort, and social figures are particularly enthusiastic about foreign trade. They can work together to promote its success. According to the reporter's idea, the government authorities should be sponsored by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Navy Department and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee should jointly prepare and designate a warship to set off on an appointed day: The collection of national product products can be assigned to the International Trade Bureau, the Commodity Inspection Bureau, the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association to engage in product collection. Within three months, it can set off at the same time as the Nanyang Commercial Inspection Group. This is the most thorough method of promoting national products, and it is also the most glorious page in the history of national products. The reporter is happy and respects his eyes to see its success.</p>
<h3 id="e180">General Situation of Shanxi Industry <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yu</p>
<p>Shanxi is a relatively rich province in my country, and it is also the province with the most developed inland transportation in our country. Since the implementation of the provincial government's ten-year construction plan, various construction undertakings have had considerable success; especially for the revitalization of national products and industries, no effort has been spared. Up to the present, most of the daily necessities have been able to be self-sufficient, and there is little need to rely on other places. If we continue to work hard to promote it in the future, the achievements in the future will be truly unlimited. Therefore, if we want everyone to use national products, we must first revitalize our industry. This is a certain element. With excellent national industrial products, it is naturally easy to promote and prevail, and there is no need to seek foreign aid. We can know this fact by looking at the situation in Shanxi. However, although Shanxi's construction undertakings have made remarkable progress, the actual situation of its national products industry is not very clear to outsiders. Therefore, I will briefly describe the general situation of Shanxi's industrial progress to provide to readers.</p>
<p>Textile Industry Since the bankruptcy of the handicraft industry in Shanxi, social figures have realized that the demand is urgent, so they have launched textile industries that produce with new-style machines. However, due to the dumping of foreign goods and high costs, sales have been hindered and unable to develop. During the implementation of the provincial government's ten-year construction plan, thanks to the government's support, the declining textile industry gradually began to recover. According to recent statistics, there are a total of fourteen cotton textile factories in the province, with a total capital of approximately 800,000 yuan, and an annual output value of more than 11 million yuan, which is much more advanced than before. As for woolen textile factories, they are just beginning to sprout. There are only three in the province, with a total capital of 520,000 yuan and an annual output value of more than 50,000 yuan. The products of this kind of factory are quite popular among social figures, and there is a great trend of demand exceeding supply; therefore, its development should have considerable progress.</p>
<p>Machinery Industry The machinery industry is mostly expanded from the Ren Shen Manufacturing Plant, which was reorganized from the former arsenal. The capital is solid and abundant, and the products should be refined and civilian. At present, there are a total of five factories, with a total capital of 5,400,7,000 yuan (excluding one) and an annual output value of 598,000 yuan (excluding three). These factories are of great importance to Shanxi's construction work, so the authorities also pay special attention to them.</p>
<p>Chemical Industry The chemical industry is still in its infancy. The existing factories are listed below: Four match factories, with a total capital of 390,000 yuan and an annual output value of 300,000 yuan (excluding one). Three paper mills, with a total capital of 930,000 yuan and an annual output value of 300,9,000 yuan. One sulfur and saltpeter factory, details unknown. One glassware factory, with a capital of 10,000 yuan and an annual output value of 37,000 yuan. One leather factory, with a total capital of 200,000 yuan, details of the annual output unknown. One pottery factory, with a capital of 130,000 yuan, details of the annual output unknown. The only larger one in the building materials industry is the Northwest Cement Plant, with a total capital of 300,000 yuan, details of the annual output unknown. From this, we can know the immaturity of Shanxi's chemical industry. However, large-scale factories are always developed from the preliminary prototype organization, so they should not be ignored, and their development should be supported.</p>
<p>Other food and beverage industries, such as flour, tobacco, wine, and soda, the clothing industry, and the cultural industry are still lagging behind and have not made significant progress. But looking at the three items mentioned earlier, like the chemical industry, although it is not yet fully developed, it will definitely be able to develop smoothly in the near future. And the entire Shanxi's use of national products will also be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Visit to the Jiangnan Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Plant <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>In recent years, China's chemical industry has been developing rapidly. The establishment of chemical industrial plants in this city is like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, showing a vigorous atmosphere. Taking the three acids that manufacture basic chemicals as an example, there is the Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Plant that manufactures Sulphuric Acid, and the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant that manufactures Hydrochloric Acid, both of which are very large in scale. Recently, the Jiangnan Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Plant was also established. I, as a reporter, was invited by Mr. Zhao Yechen, the manager of the plant, and Dr. Xue Jimin, the chief engineer, to visit the plant together with Mr. Pan Yangyao, Mr. Cheng Huanxi, and Mr. Shan Yanji. The following is a brief description of what I learned from the visit:</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Plant was established in April last year. Its main product is Glacial Acetic Acid, and its by-products are Wood Spirit or Wood Alcohol, Wood Charcoal, and Tar. The capital is set at 200,000 yuan in national currency, which was initiated and organized by Shen Shenyi, Zhang Rongchu, Zhao Yechen, Xue Jimin, and others. The address is at the intersection of Liuying Road on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, with an estimated area of about 18 mu. The factory building is spacious and the layout is very reasonable. The arrangement of machinery and all engineering designs are planned by experts. In August last year, the production was successful, and the output and composition were able to meet the long-held wishes. The color of its glacial acetic acid reaches 99.5 degrees, and the wood spirit reaches 99 degrees, which is only seen in domestic industrial raw materials and can compete with imported products. What is especially rare and valuable is that the raw materials it uses are completely domestic products, such as the chestnut firewood from Huzhou, the sulfuric acid from the Wencheng Acid Manufacturing Plant, and the lime from the local kilns. These three are the raw materials for manufacturing products.</p>
<p>Currently, the factory has more than 80 workers. Its production capacity is 3,000 pounds of glacial acetic acid, 780 pounds of wood spirit, 130 dan of charcoal, and 6,000 pounds of tar per day. However, 3,000 pounds of glacial acetic acid is not enough to meet the needs of the market, so the factory can expand significantly.</p>
<p>The manufacturing process of the above-mentioned products is to first load the chestnut firewood onto iron cars, and then push the cars into the dry distillation pot via a light railway. Then, the pot cover is sealed and coal is burned under the stove. After about eight hours, the chestnut firewood in the pot evaporates due to heat, and part of it becomes gas, which rises through the flue. After passing through the tar filter, the oil sinks, and the remaining gas rises. A gas capture machine is used to pump the gas into a cooling pipe, where cold water circulates. The gas condenses when it encounters cold and becomes wood vinegar oil and sinks. (Note: This wood vinegar oil contains wood spirit, acetic acid and other impurities). Then it is sucked into a neutralization tank, and an appropriate amount of lime is added to neutralize it. It is mixed evenly with a mixer, and then introduced into the wood spirit tower, so that the wood spirit is separated. The remaining material is then passed through a steam engine dryer and a baking board to become dry Calcium Acetate (also known as calcium acetate). Then it is moved to the distillation section, combined with sulfuric acid, placed in a decomposer and steamed. At the same time, the mixer installed in the decomposer is turned on to continuously stir it, and the decomposition is accelerated by vacuum. After six hours, the lime contained in the acetic acid is absorbed by the sulfuric acid, and acetic acid of about 75 degrees is obtained and separated separately. It is then introduced into the crude acetic acid reactor and initially evaporated to remove moisture, which can be increased to more than 90 degrees. It is then steamed in a refined acetic acid reactor to purify it, and highly purified glacial acetic acid is obtained. As for the firewood in the dry distillation pot, it has been burned into charcoal. After a considerable period of time, it is dragged into the cooling pot, and after cooling, it is taken out and becomes charcoal.</p>
<p>As for the uses of the products, they are very extensive. Now, the use of each type will be described separately as follows:</p>
<p>Glacial Acetic Acid: It is a necessary raw material for the printing and dyeing industry and the manufacture of rayon. If glacial acetic acid is mixed with fuel, the fuel will never fade. In the past, the raw materials used by printing and dyeing factories in China were completely dependent on foreign goods. According to the import and export trade statistics of the customs, the total import in the past year reached 660,557 kilograms, valued at 311,343 yuan in national currency, of which goods from a certain country accounted for the largest proportion, accounting for about seven-tenths of the total.</p>
<p>Wood Spirit: It is a necessary raw material for celluloid factories, new medicine factories, and the manufacture of artificial emerald diamonds.</p>
<p>Charcoal: It is necessary for fuel, industrial and household use.</p>
<p>Tar: Also known as wood tar, it is mostly used for coatings for machinery and wood, and is a raw material for the rubber and paint industries.</p>
<p>After the visit, I feel that if China's chemical industry can strive to revitalize and increase production efficiency and reduce costs, there is hope to recover the tens of millions of leaks every year.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Random Notes on National Products <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zhui Cheng</p>
<p>The newspaper reported: "Last year, from January to February, the total import of unnamed perfumes and cosmetics was 639,448 yuan." This is truly an alarming number!</p>
<p>Most of those who use cosmetics are rich people, and rich people often have the belief that "foreign goods are always better" imprinted in their minds. Therefore, the result is such a huge leak.</p>
<p>Cosmetics are not absolutely unusable, and domestic cosmetics are not necessarily all bad. For example, if he now uses "San San Perfume" and "Yi San Perfume" produced by the Wuzhou Factory, he will definitely not feel disappointed, and he can also reduce his expenses.</p>
<p>City merchants, inform all industries to promote domestic products with sincerity. "Promoting domestic products with sincerity" seems to be just empty talk, but in fact, to promote domestic products, the whole country must release "sincerity", otherwise, the future of domestic products will not develop no matter what.</p>
<p>Speaking of "dumping of foreign goods," isn't it because the Chinese people have no "integrity"? Therefore, on the one hand, they shout to promote domestic products, and on the other hand, the market is still full of imported goods. This is simply too insincere.</p>
<p>Therefore, to enable domestic products to defeat foreign goods, we can only hope that the people are full of "blood" and unite with "sincerity." This also depends on the efficacy of domestic tonics to generate blood.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Discussion on "Abridged Edition of Basic Classics of Sinology" <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yi</p>
<p>In recent years, the reorganization of national heritage has occupied an important position in the publishing industry. No matter which bookstore is working hard to reprint ancient books. How good or bad this trend is, we will not ask for the time being; however, the many problems of being indiscriminate and mixed cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, which grasps the authority of the publishing industry, is also working hard in this area. The publication of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, the continuous publication of rare books, and the separate sale of the Series Integration and Basic Classics of Sinology can be regarded as its great contributions in these various aspects. The day before yesterday, there was another pre-order advertisement for the "Abridged Edition of Basic Classics of Sinology" in the newspaper.</p>
<p>In his green background, we can clearly see the reason why he wants to "abridge":</p>
<p>...The Basic Classics of Sinology are the bridge for those who study Sinology. Over the years, more than a hundred types have been published successively. The scope is widening day by day, and the total price is gradually increasing, and it is gradually felt that there is still a need for simplification. Therefore, choose fifty types of books from the series that everyone should read, which are "abridged"...</p>
<p>Indeed, the low price, selling one hundred and twenty books for only twenty yuan; convenient to carry, neat decoration, all use paperback six-open format; it must be regarded as the characteristic of this abridged edition. However, there must be some discussion about his simplification method and the fifty book titles obtained by the simplification.</p>
<p>This abridged edition is divided into twelve categories. They are reading guide, philosophy, social science, linguistics, applied art, fine arts, general collection of poetry and prose, separate collection of poetry and prose, ci and qu, criticism of poetry and prose, history, and geography travel notes. Among these twelve categories, the individual believes that there are many worthy of discussion, and now they are divided and discussed:</p>
<p>Reading Guide Category: This category selects four books: Book List Answers, General Theory of Classics, Pingyi of Various Philosophers, and General Meaning of Literature and History. According to personal speculation, the selector's intention must be that Book List Answers is a general theory, and the rest are divided into the four aspects of classics, history, philosophy, and collections. However, the individual believes that history and literature also occupy an important position in Sinology, and certainly cannot be included in one book of General Meaning of Literature and History. Therefore, the individual's opinion is that at least in the field of history, Zhao Yi's Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories should be added. (Because in terms of literature, there are two books in the category of poetry and prose criticism, which can be applied.</p>
<p>Applied Technology Category: The scope of the two characters of Sinology cannot be discussed here; however, the individual always believes that this category of applied technology does not seem to be included in this "abridged" narrow twelve categories. If applied technology can be successfully classified, then why can't medicine in the Inner Canon Suwen and Compendium of Materia Medica be successfully classified? Therefore, the individual's opinion is that the applied technology category should be cancelled.</p>
<p>Fine Arts Category: The two books already selected in this category can still be used, but the individual proposes to add two more. In the field of calligraphy, add Bao Shichen's Art Boat Double Oars; in the field of painting, add Zhang Yanyuan's Records of Famous Paintings of All Dynasties.</p>
<p>General Collection of Poetry and Prose Category: In this category, there are too many poems. There is only one book of essays, Selected Essays; the individual believes that at least one collection of essays that everyone must read, Ancient Prose Cizui, should be added, so that there will not be the problem of too few essays and too many poems.</p>
<p>Separate Collection of Poetry and Prose Category: There is a huge shortcoming in what is left out in this category, that is, writers before the Tang Dynasty were not selected. The individual believes that the collections of Tao Yuanming and Cao Zijian should be added to make it suitable. Otherwise, it is inevitable that there will be a biased form.</p>
<p>Ci and Qu Category: It is very strange that there is only a general collection of ci and no separate collection. It is also questionable to select Yangchun Baixue instead of Yuan Qu Xuan for the general collection of qu. Therefore, the individual's opinion is that separate collections of ci should be added by Bai Shi, Mengchuang, and Jiaxuan; and qu should be added by Yuan Qu Xuan.</p>
<p>History Category: The listing of four types of historical events from beginning to end is very good. However, it is also very strange to select Historical Records but not the other three histories - History of the Former Han, History of the Later Han, and Records of the Three Kingdoms. If it is said that the prose of Historical Records is good, then it should not be included in the history category at all? What's more, the prose of his three histories is not bad! Therefore, from the standpoint of history, the Four Histories must all be selected. The above is a discussion of all the categories it has. In addition to these seven points, the individual also has some opinions on other aspects, and incidentally put forward for discussion:</p>
<p>In the advertisement published by the Commercial Press, he said that this abridged edition has four major features. The first is "all important books are available." According to the seven points discussed above by the individual, it seems that this abridged edition is not up to this level. Can Essential Skills for the People's Welfare, Exploitation of the Works of Nature, and Tao Shuo (applied technology category) be considered "important books"? Can History of the Former Han, History of the Later Han, Records of the Three Kingdoms, Yuan Qu Xuan, and Ancient Prose Cizui not be considered "important books"? Therefore, these places are really a temporary rush for the Commercial Press and did not ask Sinology experts to choose, resulting in malpractices. We hope that the Commercial Press will not rush to publish and sell in the future. You must know that this has a great impact on the publishing industry and the future of culture.</p>
<p>Their third feature is that all sentences are punctuated. That's right, punctuating sentences can make reading easier and help understanding. However, Chinese ancient books often cause great disputes because of punctuation; therefore, punctuation is often a very important issue in Sinology. For example, scholars in the past had many questions about the punctuation of books such as Xunzi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Mozi, Guanzi, Han Feizi, Shangshu, Zuozhuan, and Shiji. Therefore, the individual's opinion is that Chinese ancient books do not need to be punctuated, just let the readers understand it themselves. Otherwise, if there is a misjudgment, it will be a great harm.</p>
<p>The books listed in this abridged edition, some have annotations and some do not. The individual feels that it should be unified. Like the Han, Liu, Ouyang, and Wang collections in the separate collections of poetry and prose, there are Han Ji's annotations by Fang Shiju and Su Shi's annotations by Wang Xianqian, which can be used as references. It seems that readers do not need to print plain text like this.</p>
<p>In the minds of ordinary people in the past, novels were indeed considered insignificant: unexpectedly, there is no novel category in this abridged edition. The individual believes that the short stories of the Tang and Song dynasties and the Water Margin Dream of the Red Chamber of the Ming and Qing dynasties, at least, should be required reading for everyone; this cannot but be said to be a shortcoming in the selection.</p>
<p>I have said a lot above, and the individual is not attacking the Commercial Press. The individual is because it is an important and eye-catching member in the Chinese publishing industry, and I am afraid that I will dare to make extremely sincere contributions without considering my own taste.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Introduction to "History of Chinese Prostitution" <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Shou Qiu</p>
<p>The issue of prostitution is indeed a very important issue in social problems. Some people advocate public prostitution to prevent the spread of syphilis; some people advocate banning prostitution to stop the sin of adultery: we will not care about the right and wrong of these two arguments for the time being. But we can resolutely say that the cause of prostitution is the impact of social depression. Because the social economy is bankrupt, and women have no way to go, they have to resort to prostitution. Dr. Gu Hongming once said, "Prostitution of prostitutes is not prostitution, but selling poverty"! How painful this sentence is!</p>
<p>Regarding the opinions of Chinese and foreign scholars on prostitution, according to St. Thomas, "Prostitution of prostitutes in cities is like the sewers of palaces. If there are no sewers in palaces, palaces will become smelly." The German Berlier said: "Marriage is one side of the sexual life of the civilian world, and the other side is prostitution. Marriage is the positive side of sex, and prostitution is the inside." The famous German doctor Kuhn also said: "Prostitution is not something that should be tolerated, but it can be said to be a necessary evil. This, we will not care about it, and talk about the origin of the prostitution system. Some people think that it started with Guan Zhong. History tells us that Guan Zhong once set up three hundred women to facilitate travel. However, whether this prostitution was initiated by Guan Zhong is still necessary to study. It is a pity that there is no special book in China for reference. Although newspapers and magazines occasionally have records, they are all omitted and not detailed. This is really a pity!</p>
<p>Recently, the Life Bookstore has published a "History of Chinese Prostitutes", written by Wang Shunu. The price of the book is one yuan in legal currency, and the number of pages of the book reaches 356 pages. This book is a work of research on the prostitution system. The author narrates the origin of prostitution very thoroughly. The whole book is divided into six chapters: The first chapter is the introduction. The second chapter is the era of witch prostitution, from the Tang Dynasty of Yin Dynasty to the fall of King Zhou, which is the first period. It is counted from 1783 BC, a total of 644 years. The third chapter is the era of slave prostitutes and the occurrence of official prostitutes. From the Western Zhou Dynasty to the demise of the Eastern Han Dynasty, it is counted from 1122 BC to 218 AD, which is the second period, a total of 1340 years. The fourth chapter is the era of family prostitutes (ie, singing prostitutes) and slave prostitutes, from the Three Kingdoms to the demise of the Southern and Northern Dynasties and the Sui Dynasty (220 AD), a total of 435 years. The fifth chapter is the era of the most prosperous official prostitutes, namely the four dynasties of the Tang Dynasty; Song Dynasty; Yuan Dynasty; and Ming Dynasty (618 AD), which is the fourth period, a total of 1028 years. The sixth chapter is the era of private prostitution, since the Manchus entered the customs in 1644, which is the fifth period, a total of 288 years. The collection of various materials is very complete, and it can indeed be said to be a very valuable book now - when the prostitution issue has become an important social issue.</p>
<p>The material selection of this Chinese prostitution can indeed be said to be very extensive. At a time when the voice of banning prostitution is loudly sung, everyone can take a look at it; especially those who study the issue of prostitution should not miss it. Because this book not only describes the origin of prostitution and the evolution of prostitution, but also the causes of the prostitution system, the background of the prostitution system, the relationship between the prostitution system and society, we can all have a considerable understanding from this book, and we can also know a lot of interesting anecdotes about prostitutes. Therefore, I think this History of Chinese Prostitution needs to be introduced.</p>
<p>Finally, let me add a few words, that is, the author of the History of Chinese Prostitution, Mr. Wang Shunu, wrote this book entirely in the attitude of a scholar, for the study of people who study the issue of prostitution, and there is no personal opinion of the author in it, which is indeed commendable.</p>

<p>(XI) Publishing New Books</p>
<p>Judging from the trend of publishing new books in new bookstores, except for one or two that have other specific policies, the entire new book industry is almost a history of speculation. Naturally, the publication of books by bookstores must adapt to objective needs within a considerable range, and sometimes they have to invent and then create the needs related to culture. However, if you just blindly follow the trend, follow others, and produce roughly, it is better to have no new bookstore than to have it.</p>
<p>If divided by the formal stage, the development of the new book industry can be said to have been caused by literary books. Under the heavy pressure of warlord politics, the best way for intellectuals to find relief is to seek expression in literature. Therefore, the romantic literature of creation in the early stage was very popular among young people, and the satirical writings of the Beiping Yusi Society were also admired by everyone. The establishment of the Creation Society's retail department, the relocation of the Beixin Bookstore, and the profitable business of Guanghua Taidong all caused a rush, and many new bookstores were produced. This trend can be called the literary period.</p>
<h3 id="e188">How to Watch Movies? (Below) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Mingyu</p>
<p>Third, this book indicates that movies are definitely not only simple "entertainment value". In addition to this function, it has a more important "social value". In other words, it is not only for people to pass the time occasionally, but also shows all aspects of life, analyzes the nature of things and problems, and provides people with good solutions and inferences. In fact, movies are not only a good thing for social entertainment, but also a useful tool for social education. Even if people who watch movies only seek entertainment, the audience's knowledge, attitudes, and behavior are unconsciously influenced by the consciousness of the screen.</p>
<p>Fourth, the book finally suggests that the production of future films should focus more on social and life issues, such as films similar to "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "The Outlaw" should be produced more. This is undoubtedly a very meaningful proposal. It also says: "The main purpose of future movies is not to make profits, but to educate and entertain the public." This is indeed accurate. Of course, whether it can be achieved in this way is another matter.</p>
<p>In short, this book is a good reading material for inspiring people to develop the ability to choose and appreciate movies. In addition to explaining the process and technology of film production, it also pays attention to the good and bad effects that movies can have on society, and proposes future reform plans. - The original work was compiled by experts designated by the American Educational Research Committee for young students to read. Mr. Hong Shen said in his preface: "I think there are three stages of movies. At first, it was just watching the excitement; a little more progress can watch the story; it must be that those who have a considerable understanding of film techniques can truly appreciate the art of movies. The basic knowledge mentioned in this book can indeed increase the reader's appreciation - and pleasure." I hope that Chinese movie audiences will all become appreciators in the third stage!</p>
<p>Finally, I have to say a word or two about the translation of this book. Although I don't want to do the work of proofreading or nitpicking, the writing style of the translation is not satisfactory. The sentences are often long and stiff, and one can tell at a glance that it is the result of "literal translation". Ordinary reading materials do not necessarily have to be "elegant", but they must not be "unreachable" because of seeking "faithfulness". The translator's writing style may be for the sake of "fidelity", but some places are too far from the conventions of Chinese literature, and even commas are used sparingly. For example: "Perhaps the most common error in using sound is the general attempt to accurately reproduce all the sounds found in real life." (page 177) "In superbly directed and cleverly constructed films, these various shots must be used so skillfully that you don't feel that you are applying a variety of camera distances." (page 139) This is just a random example. A good translation should make people - whether they know Western literature or not - read it very smoothly; unless the original work is dry and tasteless.</p>
<p>This book is listed as the tenth type of "Sunday Standard Book". Mr. Hong Shen selected it. According to Article 3 of the "Sunday Standard Book Publication Principles": "The writing style of the Sunday Standard Book must be clear and concise." This book has not yet reached this "standard". I think that although it is not necessary to re-translate, under the premise of not deviating from the original meaning, the translator should have the obligation to revise it in the re-edition, because the reason why "Standard Book" becomes "Standard Book" has objective value, and in today's need for film understanding, the general readers must not be discouraged or even lose courage because of this!</p>
<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3 id="e189">Inaugural Address <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Individuals are cells of society. To seek the soundness of society, we must first have the health of each individual. In other words, only with sound social cells can we produce an overall sound society.</p>
<p>If we want to seek the health of the people, there are only two ways: one is to prevent the occurrence of diseases, and the other is to rescue the occurrence of diseases. The former is active hygiene, and the latter is temporary medical music. Therefore, sound people attach equal importance to hygiene and medical knowledge; whether the society is sound or not is always determined by the abundance of such knowledge among its people.</p>
<p>In order to enable the people to increase such knowledge, this journal is attached to Shen Bao. Every week, we will do our best to guide readers in the knowledge of medicine and hygiene, so that everyone has sufficient knowledge, so that there are measures both before and after the event. We hope to make a slight contribution to our unsound society; because only when people have abundant medical and health knowledge can there be a "road to health" to follow. At the beginning of publication, I express my wish like this.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Determination is Necessary to Quit Smoking <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhiping</p>
<p>Human body activities rely entirely on the sufficient Golgi apparatus within cells. This ensures strength and vigor. If smoking habits lead to its loss, resulting in exhaustion, relying on nicotine for stimulation becomes inevitable. Therefore, recent advancements in egg yolk lecithin for smoking cessation aim to promote the increase of Golgi bodies in the body, specifically a type of fatty substance (Go'gi Elipoid Material). However, smokers often hesitate when beginning to quit, fearing the recurrence of old ailments and increased suffering.</p>
<p>To address this, scholars have extracted similar fats and endocrine substances from robust male and female animals like lions, tigers, and orangutans, creating "Body-Comp" for men and "Beauty-Comp" for women. These medications excel at eradicating nicotine addiction and facilitating early cessation. Taking one pill of these medications is equivalent to consuming 60-90 grams of egg yolk lecithin (the daily recommended dose), preventing recurrence of old ailments and relapse. The body swiftly becomes stronger, and bowel movements normalize. With two months of continuous use, the skin becomes moisturized, the complexion rosy and tender, restoring youthfulness.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Cold Turns into Consumption <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Colds are most easily contracted during cold weather, often leading to coughing up blood and developing into pulmonary tuberculosis, which is a serious concern.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the onset of a cold, "Lung-Comp Elixir" should be taken. According to my clinical experience, this medication can also treat whooping cough, chronic coughs, and phlegm-induced asthma in the elderly. This is because the medication is formulated with hormones from the lungs and pancreas, as well as egg yolk lecithin, which helps strengthen weakened physical strength and improves appetite and digestion. Therefore, it is particularly effective for all stages (1, 2, and 3) of pulmonary tuberculosis, dry coughs, blood sputum, night sweats, hemoptysis, loss of appetite, and other symptoms. If tuberculosis patients also suffer from weakness such as insomnia, they can also take Panticome Tab for easier recovery. These two medications do not contain any inferior ingredients and can be taken regularly to strengthen the body and rejuvenate the complexion.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Menstrual Disorders <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Youren</p>
<p>——The Root of Infertility——</p>
<p>From an endocrine perspective, menstrual disorders in women often stem from abnormal ovarian function. Therefore, correcting menstrual disorders requires studying ovarian function. Common menstrual disorders caused by abnormal ovarian function include amenorrhea, scanty or excessive menstruation, frequent menstruation, infrequent menstruation, and abnormal uterine bleeding. Those with these menstrual disorders often experience other issues such as neurasthenia, clouded consciousness, mental depression, heart palpitations, insomnia, anemia, leukorrhea, and lack of sexual desire, depriving them of happiness and leading to family discord and suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>"Beauty-Comp" is the latest German invention for regulating menstruation. It can correct all menstrual disorders caused by abnormal ovarian function. "Beauty-Comp" is made from the endocrine glands of female animals with strong reproductive function, fundamentally eliminating premature or delayed maturation of ovarian cells and enabling the regeneration of healthy cells, thus normalizing ovarian function and eliminating all menstrual disorders. Furthermore, "Beauty-Comp" is effective for people with other endocrine dysfunctions, such as premature aging, neuralgia, dizziness, back pain, cold legs, and excessive leukorrhea. It can be purchased and taken freely without any adverse effects.</p>
<h3 id="e193">"Clinon" and Gonorrheal Arthritis <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Sen</p>
<p>Patient Mr. He Boqi suffered from gonorrheal arthritis, with severe pain in all joints. He tried numerous Chinese and foreign remedies without any relief; his condition continued to worsen. Friends feared he was developing gonorrheal septicemia, which is very dangerous. He was referred to me by a friend. In addition to some electrotherapy, I prescribed "Clinon." After taking it for three weeks, the inflammation subsided and he fully recovered in just over a month.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Acute Gonorrhea <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Patient Mr. Xing Xuncong contracted gonorrhea, experiencing high fever and frequent urination. Each urination felt like being stabbed with a knife. The glans penis was swollen and the foreskin could not be retracted, a dangerous situation. His companion urgently brought him to me. I diagnosed acute gonorrhea and prescribed "Clinon," invented by German Dr. Biedel. This medication can penetrate membranes to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, and alleviate swelling. After taking it for two weeks, the pain stopped, the discharge cleared, and all symptoms subsided. He has not relapsed in several years.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Latest Invention for Treating Gonorrhea <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Peter from Germany Lectures at Medical Universities and Presents a Dissertation, Earning an Honorary Doctorate</p>
<p>(Above omitted) The human body temperature is suitable for the growth of gonococci, causing them to multiply rapidly, making treatment difficult. Traditional methods focus on treating the symptoms, such as promoting urination to reduce inflammation, but this often stimulates the kidneys, leading to urinary retention and worsening the condition. Recently, German Dr. Peter (Biedel), based on decades of laboratory and clinical research, extracted fatty and lipoid substances from plants and animals, supplemented with pus-removing, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory components, to create the "Clinon" holy medicine for gonorrhea. After taking this medication, it quickly initiates an anti-gonorrheal effect in the body, stopping pain and clearing pus from inflamed mucous membranes. The gonorrhea is swiftly cleared, and the remaining toxins in various parts of the body are completely eliminated, ensuring permanent eradication. Inflammations such as gonorrheal prostatitis, orchitis, and arthritis are quickly alleviated. Therefore, it is already popular in Western countries, without any domineering side effects, and both doctors and patients appreciate its use. It is said that Dr. Peter has lectured at various medical universities and presented dissertations, earning honorary doctorates (excerpt from a German medical journal).</p>

<p>Consultation Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Diffuse Prostatitis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal diffuse prostatitis is a type of acute prostatitis. Initially, it presents with frequent urination, similar to posterior urethritis. However, it can be easily identified through scientific examination of the prostate. While frequent urination is a common symptom of many types of prostatitis, it is not always present. Therefore, frequent urination cannot be considered a unique symptom of prostatitis. Instead, it is evidence of gonococci invading the posterior urethral mucosa. Doctors lacking knowledge and experience often misdiagnose this, leading to chronic prostatitis and various complications, causing endless suffering to patients.</p>
<p>In addition to the above symptoms, patients may experience fullness in the rectum, and sometimes severe pain between the perineum and rectum, which eventually radiates to the scrotum, glans penis, ischium, and thighs, making it impossible for patients to sit or stand. I typically treat this condition with a combination of surgery and internal medication, which is very effective. Mr. Qian Fu, residing in Xiaodongmen, suffered from this disease, experiencing extreme pain. He consulted several doctors without any relief. Later, a friend gave him my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases." He came to me for treatment, where I performed prostate massage, electrotherapy, and prescribed the German "Clinon" internal medication. After only four weeks of treatment, he was completely cured. This is because "Clinon" not only has the effect of penetrating membranes to kill bacteria but also induces the body to produce anti-gonorrheal substances. Combined with electrotherapy, it achieves remarkable results.</p>

<p>Fever, Bloody Sputum, Cough, Weak Stomach</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Han Hongdao, 24 years old, a student, suddenly coughed up a bowl of blood during the "January 28th Incident." Since then, he has been bedridden. Any movement causes shortness of breath and increased body temperature. He gradually developed a cough with increased phlegm, sometimes containing blood. He experienced occasional chest pain and tried various treatments without relief. After three years, he became thin and weak, with a low-grade fever of 37.2 to 37.7 degrees Celsius in the afternoon, loss of appetite, and fatigue. He tried purchasing and taking "Lung-Comp Elixir." Before finishing several bottles, the bleeding stopped, the phlegm thinned, his appetite improved, and his cough subsided, and the temperature also sharply decreased. Later, he wrote to me asking if there would be any harm in taking more "Lung-Comp Elixir." I told him that it was a lung hormone preparation that strengthened the lungs and stomach, and it was beneficial and harmless. If he was excessively weak, he could also take the German "Body-Comp." I also advised Mr. Han to sleep quietly for two hours after lunch every day and go to bed before 9:00 PM. I heard that Mr. Han followed my treatment and recuperated for more than a month, becoming strong and energetic, enjoying a new lease on life, and he has not relapsed for more than a year.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Nocturnal Emission, Premature Ejaculation <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Sexual neurasthenia leads to nocturnal emission, and gonadal atrophy leads to premature ejaculation, and in severe cases, impotence. Patients often have underdeveloped sexual organs, weak erections, and a short stature like a child. They become pessimistic, depressed, and fatigued, and may even be at risk of suicide.</p>
<p>Therefore, treatment must rejuvenate the patient's deteriorated reproductive function, which can only be achieved by taking the German "Body-Comp." It is made from the internal secretions of the testicles and reproductive glands of strong and vigorous animals such as orangutans, lions, tigers, sea dogs, cattle, and horses. It can cure nocturnal emission, impotence, weak sexual ability, low back pain, insomnia, weak brain function, and developmental disorders. Because the medication does not contain any harmful ingredients, it can also be taken even when not ill to increase strength.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Insomnia, Night Sweats, Coughing, Emaciation <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Patient Mr. Gu Xie, 29 years old, a government official, had been suffering from coughing with phlegm for five years, along with emaciation, night sweats, insomnia, weak stomach, poor appetite, and pessimistic thoughts. His complexion was pale, his phlegm was difficult to expectorate, and he had mild chest pain. His wife also had a cough, fatigue, and irregular periods. Mr. Gu heard that "Lung-Comp Elixir" was very effective and bought five bottles, which he and his wife took together. They cleared the phlegm and cough, and cured the night sweats, weak stomach, chest pain, and other symptoms. Through a friend, Mr. Wang, he inquired me about recuperation methods. I advised them to sleep in separate beds, maintain chastity, and keep the windows open to ensure sufficient sunlight and air. At the same time, I prescribed the German "Body-Comp" to treat insomnia and emaciation, and Bronon Tab for his wife to regulate her periods and strengthen her body. I heard that after two months of treatment, both husband and wife regained their strength, and an X-ray examination confirmed that the tuberculosis was completely eradicated.</p>

<p>The stomach is an essential organ for digesting food. If the stomach functions well, nutrition is adequately absorbed, leading to strong blood and a strong body, which is essential for human life.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tao Mengliang experienced bloating and intermittent pain after eating. He heard that "Strong Stomach Essence" was very effective and bought it. His stomach problems were cured. Later, when I was treating his athlete's foot, I prescribed him to continue to take "Strong Stomach Essence" because the medication contains a large amount of Vitamin B. Mr. Tao followed the advice and soon achieved good results, and his body became exceptionally strong.</p>
<h3 id="e201">New Treatment Success of Anti-Gonorrhea Serum <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Qifeng</p>
<p>I contracted gonorrhea in the spring of 1930. Fearing that it would become chronic, I immediately sought treatment at a major hospital. After less than half a month, I had to be discharged due to urgent matters at home. Unfortunately, this led to the chronic condition I feared most. I was treated every year without any relief, and the condition worsened, leading to posterior urethritis. I constantly felt joint pain. Later, I learned from a colleague that Dr. Yao Juyan had recently purchased a large batch of anti-serum from Germany, which was effective in treating all new and old gonorrhea. I drove to his clinic for treatment. Dr. Yao treated me with anti-gonorrhea serum, which relieved the pain in all my joints. Then, he used electrical diathermy therapy and completely eliminated the four to five years of gonorrheal infection within four weeks. This is truly a new treatment success for gonorrhea in the 20th century. Dr. Yao is indeed a master of clearing gonorrhea.</p>

<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>Last autumn, Chen Wang, a woman from Chongming, brought her ten-year-old daughter Xiaomei to Shanghai to find her sister in Pudong. On the way, they were lured into the home of Bai Er, a rickshaw puller from the same village, who forcibly took her as his wife. Wang, unfamiliar with the area, had no choice but to submit. Later, Bai Er's father, Bai Dengtang, believed that Wang had mistreated his five-year-old grandson (Bai Er's son from a previous marriage), leading to his death. Bai Dengtang harbored resentment towards Wang. On the thirteenth day of the lunar new year, he secretly took Xiaomei away and, through the introduction of rickshaw puller Shi Guihua, sold her to Yongyuan, a disciple of the elderly nun Huilin, the abbess of Wanshou Convent in Shenjia Lane, Pudong, to become a young nun. The price was 30 yuan, and the broker fee was 2 yuan. After Chen Wang learned of what had happened, she was devastated and wept to everyone she met. Onlookers felt sorry for her and reported it to the police station in charge...who ordered all involved to be arrested and detained for investigation.</p>
<p>How will the aforementioned perpetrators be punished? This is a legal matter, and they are currently "arrested and detained for investigation," so we will leave it at that. Outside of the legal realm, we have two thoughts: First, the authorities are now in the process of registering maids, and yet such things still happen amidst the calls for maid rescue. This shows that the issue of rescuing maids is not simply a matter of rescue, but rather it will be included in the whole social problem, which can only be solved after the entire social system has been reformed; Second, the so-called monks and nuns, who should be free from worldly desires and have pure hearts, are no longer the original ascetics escaping from the world. Now, the so-called monks and nuns have been assimilated by capitalism and have become a "profession." The "Buddhist shops" that can be seen everywhere in Shanghai are undoubtedly the strongest evidence for this assertion.</p>
<p>How many people like Xiaomei in the "Young Nun Rescued and Returns to Secular Life" case, or similar to that, are there in the world? How many more future victims will there be? We cannot imagine it, and we dare not imagine it; however, one thing can be said for sure is that Xiaomei in the "Young Nun Rescued and Returns to Secular Life" case is just a small wave in the sea of similar victims.</p>
<p>Of course, what distinguishes Xiaomei from others is that, besides being sold, the buyer was a so-called monk who was supposed to be pure from worldly desires. Therefore, we have more feelings and a deeper understanding of this society. However, if we think further about this problem, for example, the current buyer was also bought by others in the past, then how would that be explained? Extending to the original instigator, why did they separate family members? Then, it would be difficult for us to give it an explanation based on personal gains and losses.</p>
<p>Separating family members should naturally be subject to the severe sanctions of the law, but sometimes legal sanctions seem insufficient, so what other measures should be taken? And whether the so-called registration of maids outside of the law can achieve the effect of preventing and prohibiting such things is what we cannot help but worry about.</p>

<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>The mountain road was already dim. I stepped on the vast night, walking alone in the misty forest of Kakimoya Mountain. My heart was filled with the loneliness and solitude of the night. I was aimlessly searching for my wandering home.</p>
<p>Suddenly, two dark human shadows appeared in front of me, like two ghostly figures blocking my view. I heard a single, simple sound coming from ahead. I was so scared that I fell backward into the grassy thicket like a puppet. My head started to spin. My ears were buzzing. My eyes were filled with darkness. My heart was a turbulent sea. I shouted. However, a single, simple sound came from the front again, like thunder, flying far over my head.</p>
<p>I gasped for breath. I did not shout again. My throat was hoarse and parched. My face was covered in sweat. I stretched out my arms. I felt like those two dark figures were about to devour me. I didn't see their faces clearly. They were wearing dark, furry dog ​​skin hats on their heads. They were wearing dark, furry leather coats. They were making shooting gestures, each holding a small pistol: "Friend! We've been waiting for you for a long time..." My teeth were chattering. In a pleading tone, I said urgently:</p>
<p>"...Oh, oh...Friends, I, I, I am the same as you...Life has driven me into these mountains and fields...I have no money. I only have my restless soul, and the fighting muscles on my body...and, and, and the only small luggage roll that warms me. Moreover, there are two dry corn cakes wrapped in my small luggage roll. Friends, if you are hungry, I am willing to give them to you...If, if you don't believe my words are true, then, you can search me..."</p>
<p>I didn't say anything more. I faced them silently. Looking at their appearance, they seemed to be moved by my words. They looked at each other for a moment, one of them shook his head, looking sad, then quickly squatted in front of me and asked in a low voice, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>"Nowhere definite..." I said miserably.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>
<p>"Kuketobo..."</p>
<p>"Home?"</p>
<p>"Where is home! Home was destroyed in the fires of September 18th! I was driven out of my hometown by our enemies, and then I ran around everywhere..."</p>
<p>(The key to my memory was unlocked again: I seemed to have returned to my hellish hometown).</p>
<p>I was confused. I was sad.</p>
<p>The two "young robbers" in front of me (I actually called them that) were silent for a long time without saying a word. They stared at my face with melancholy eyes. (The night was black, and my face was black). Then, the one who was talking to me said, "Friend, then let's go find a place to stay together."</p>
<p>I didn't answer him immediately. I was timid and retreating: I was worried about my old coat, and I was even more worried about my only small luggage roll. Finally, I hesitated and murmured: "Well..."</p>
<p>He said straightforwardly: "What well... Don't doubt us..." After thinking for a while, he said again: "Once we meet, we are friends. If you think it is okay to be friends with us, in the future, we might as well live together. We are all young people..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, his companion stepped forward and patted me on the shoulder, interrupting:</p>
<p>"Two months ago, we never thought we would spend our wandering life in these mountains and fields. We were all young people who had received a university education. Since leaving school, we ran to the front line and participated in our anti-Japanese work along the Middle East line. Who knew that the war was unfavorable, and unfortunately our team was disarmed by the enemy. In this way, we all became prisoners of the enemy! After being imprisoned for two days, three of us were finally reborn. On the way to escape, within a few days, one of us died in a dilapidated small town on a late autumn night due to serious injuries. Since then, after losing a brave comrade, we also left that small town for the sake of life, and started running around in these mountains and fields. We walk every day. We also hide our bodies in the forests along the road every day. We use our alert ears to listen to the sounds on the road. Therefore, our hearts have gradually become sad. Our thoughts are like being covered by a black net. Regarding our lost actions, we deeply felt a sense of embarrassment and despair. Therefore, we often timidly stick our heads out of the forest and watch the backs of those who walk away. I remember once, we encountered a strong passing merchant, which made us feel confused! As a result, we were each hit hard on the legs by that guy, and he escaped..."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but ask anxiously: "Then why didn't you shoot him down?"</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly, then stammered, "Guns, hum... Since suffering from that guy, our legs have been aching for more than ten days, and we didn't dare to walk..."</p>
<p>In this way, we went on the road. I was no longer timid and retreating. The mountains and fields were as silent as a tomb. The night was quiet, the mountain road was quiet, as if our hearts were also quiet. Walking, walking, one of them, close to me on the right, gently patted my shoulder and said with a laugh, "Didn't you ask why we didn't shoot? Look, this thing can't knock anyone down!" As he said that, he took the gun out of his pocket and waved it for me to see.</p>
<p>I was surprised and took the pistol from his hand. I realized that his pistol was not a real one. It was a small toy that was very popular in toy stores and prepared for children: it could only make a sound but could not hit people. At this time, I couldn't help but laugh secretly in my heart: Ah, these are really two funny guys.</p>
<p>He grabbed my shoulder with his hand, humming a song, and said excitedly: "You, you, you, don't look down on this thing, you know, on this wandering and hungry road, it is our only savior..."</p>
<p>The moon rose high in the sky. A clear white light flowed in all directions.</p>
<p>I was not alone. I had two more friends.</p>
<p>Late at night, my friends and I stayed in the village of Nuoerzhake.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Pigeons <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>Occasionally, a pair of greyish-blue pigeons flew from the rooftop across from us, made a circle, and landed on the cement railing of the balcony. They looked around, leisurely beginning to pace back and forth, preening their wings.</p>
<p>I leaned against the window, gazing at those adorable shadows, vividly jumping and hopping before my eyes, and a scene from years ago floated up in my heart—In the past, I was not unfamiliar with these little creatures; when we were still in our hometown, three pigeon houses were kept in the old ancestral mansion—our old residence. Grandfather loved raising these things; he always played with the pigeons when he was free, and he often carefully changed their nests, added water, and cleaned their cages. During times of avian pox, he was even more diligent in stringing mung beans for them.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Our banana residence had two rectangular small courtyards on either side. On the left was a tall Camellia japonica tree that reached the roof ridge, and on the right was a similarly planted magnolia tree. Inside was our bedroom. After we started keeping pigeons, two pairs of pigeon cages were placed in those two small courtyards, each cage having twenty-four compartments, but in reality, only sixteen pairs of pigeons lived there, with eight empty compartments. According to Grandfather, this was to prepare for any stray pigeons they might bring back to live with them.</p>
<p>Because among these pigeons, sometimes one or two pairs would fly away and not return, but after a few days, we would see them hurriedly flying back; moreover, some would even bring back one or two new companions. Therefore, Grandfather once told me:</p>
<p>"These intelligent little animals know how to love their home, but when their master's family declines, they will leave and never return. That's why there's an old saying, 'Ungrateful pigeons fly to prosperous places!'"</p>
<p>When we were young, those pigeons almost became our only companions in childhood. Hearing their cooing in the early morning or at dusk would make us feel joyful and very affectionate.</p>
<p>Standing on the nearby hillside, one could see the small red flag on the roof of our house fluttering in the wind from afar. This was said to be a marker to prevent the pigeons from getting lost when they flew out, unable to find their old home.</p>
<p>We were delighted by the arrival of spring when the geese came, because that was when we could fly pigeons with bells. Grandfather prepared many bamboo whistles in advance. In the morning sunlight, he tied the bamboo whistles one by one with red silk thread and fastened them between the pigeons' toes. When we now recall the impression in our memory at that time, we feel that Grandfather was not like an old man in his fifties, but rather almost as childlike as we were.</p>
<p>When the sky was high and clear, and the spring breeze was warm, we would often hear loud and melodious music in the sky in the mountains or deep valleys, which would evoke a sense of lightness and desolation in people!—This was the sound of the pigeons flying against the wind, causing the wind to enter the whistles.</p>
<p>After several years like this, Grandfather passed away in the autumn of one year; Father was also a wanderer living a nomadic life abroad, and the pigeons gradually went unmanaged. Although we loved the pigeons, I had already been sent to a private school to study, and I no longer had time to play with them. And as time passed, the shadows of those mischievous little things gradually disappeared from my heart.</p>
<p>About a year later, Father also passed away, so Mother, because she was so poor and had no other choice, sold those three pigeon houses—actually, only two were left at this time; one had escaped when Grandfather died—to my third uncle.</p>
<p>That story is almost twenty years in the past now, and for these twenty years, I have been wandering the crossroads of foreign lands. For the sake of life, for the sake of burdens, in those long days, I would never allow myself a moment of leisure to think about these distant past events, even though these stories still occupy a place in my memory, they only flash by occasionally and do not make the sadness of losing a childhood twenty years ago reappear.</p>

<p>— (Fool)</p>
<p>A fire broke out in the slums of Tianjin, killing over a hundred men and women. The cries shook the heavens; the scene was extremely tragic. Old Tan the Third is truly merciful and compassionate, saving as if rescuing from a disaster. This is a charitable undertaking that sustains life and provides for death.</p>
<p>In Gaoliu Village, Shuyang County, which is under the jurisdiction of Hai Prefecture, a "crying society" was discovered. On the Lantern Festival according to the lunar calendar, a large group of women gathered at the Earth Mother Temple in the village, linked arms, and wept bitterly. In red makeup and emerald sleeves, they lamented like swallows and warbled like orioles, incessantly throughout the night. Old Tan the Third says that the purpose of this crying society is still unclear to him. I cannot sympathize with this crying society, but in Chinese affairs, there is only crying; there is no other solution besides crying.</p>

<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>Jingzi looked at her father through the double wire mesh of the small window and felt that he didn't look like he did back home in the summer. His hair was long, his eyes were sunken and very large, and his whiskers surrounded his mouth in a furry way. Jingzi could see that her father was thin, as if he had been sick, but her father was smiling as he scratched his hanging hair and said:</p>
<p>"Jingzi, does (奶) miss Dad?"</p>
<p>Jingzi turned her bright little eyes, remembering that her (奶奶) had cried many times at home. Mom took Jingzi away from home, taking a rumbling train for two days. Last night, they passed through several brightly lit streets and settled in a courtyard full of strangers. When she went out in the morning, Mom had told her: "Don't tell Dad that (奶奶) often cries." At this time, she very sensibly twisted her small head of tousled hair, looked at Mom standing next to her, then looked at Dad's thin face, which was obscured by the wire mesh. Mom forced a smile and patted Jingzi's head, saying:</p>
<p>"Tell Dad."</p>
<p>In her little heart, she suddenly remembered that her (奶奶), with tearful eyes, often said that sentence:</p>
<p>"(奶奶) tells Dad to go home soon."</p>
<p>Dad smiled slightly, then quietly looked at Mom's face, which was pressed against the window frame. Mom didn't speak, her eyes slowly reddened, and she exhaled with a stuffy nose. After a while, tears fell in strings. Jingzi knew that Mom was sad, so she called out to Mom and cried quietly herself. Usually at home, when Dad came back from outside, he would hug Jingzi or kiss her rosy cheeks and ask:</p>
<p>"Is Jingzi naughty?"</p>
<p>She would definitely answer "No," or "Jingzi is a good child, not naughty." Dad would then take out candy from his pocket and stuff it into her chubby little hands, but now Dad seemed sick, locked in such a rat cage. A layer of gloomy shadow covered Jingzi's little heart, and she burst into tears, shouting</p>
<p>"Mom, let's go home with Dad!" (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Understanding Romance"</p>
<p>One point of talent, one point of affection. Who is heartless, who is affectionate? Beautiful women all pity talented men. Talented men also love beautiful women. But there is one point that is regrettable. The length of affection is uneven. There are those who have affection on weekdays but can't meet. There are those who are unrelated but become intimate. There are those who begin with and abandon in the end. There are those who become Wu and Yue first and then get married. It's not that people's hearts are thick or thin. It's just that talent is shallow or deep. Is it the start of change today? There have been many people in the past. Admirable is Song Hong who didn't release a refined sugar woman. Lovable is Princess Lechang holding a mirror unmarried again. Detestable is Li Yi who is heartless and forgets old favors. Abominable is Wang Kui who intentionally goes back on his former oath. Dreaming of willows is all intimate. Writing poems on leaves also makes marriage. It's laughable how people are deluded. Stealing jade and fragrance is seen as proper. Deceitful couples recognize it as real. What's the point of fighting over jealousy? It only stirs up trouble and is not peaceful. Laughable - not understanding the two words of romance. Boasting of being talented men and beautiful women. Isn't it that they are misled by romance? The Yangtai is not a romantic pavilion. Even if romance is made, where is the truth? However. Being affectionate is not a matter of romance. Even if romance is light a little. I advise all romantic talented men. No talent, no affection. Making romance by force is the crime of romance. Enjoy love where you can get it.</p>

<p>A special production by Yi Hua Company, directed by Yue Feng, starring Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Zhou Xuan, Guan Hongda, Jiang Xiu, Ye Wenqiu, Zhu Tianhong, Liu Li and other major stars, the full-sound dialogue blockbuster "Wedding Night," was previously publicly screened at the top-tier Carlton Theater in this city on Lunar New Year's Day. For a time, praise was universal, and it was widely recognized as an unprecedented masterpiece and supreme creation in the Chinese film scene. Therefore, although the initial four-day run was extended to nine days, the audience's enthusiasm only increased, showing a desire to continue indefinitely. However, due to contractual relationships, it was not possible to continue the run, leaving audience members who missed the screenings with regret. Since the end of the screening, Yi Hua and the Carlton have received dozens of letters and telegrams every day requesting a re-screening. In light of this, the two parties, after consultation, decided to re-screen the film with a brand new copy after "Song of Everlasting Regret" in order to reward the enthusiastic support of the audience.</p>

<p>A Scene from "Peach and Plum Competing for Beauty"</p>
<p>The setting for "Peach and Plum Competing for Beauty" is a moonlit lakeside:</p>
<p>There is the quiet sound of flowing water, the graceful posture of willows, an endless expanse of grass in the distant fields, and the blue waves constantly kissing the pebbles on the shore, kissing the old roots of an old tree. The old tree is so thick that two people cannot embrace it, enough for you to lean on and ponder. Sparse branches, green leaves, everything is enough to evoke people's melancholy! This is not a place for frivolous men and wanton women to sing of love and dance, this is a place for a beautiful girl to secretly cherish spring, or for a lovelorn youth to vent .</p>
<p>Brief Account of "Old and New Shanghai"</p>
<p>"Old and New Shanghai" tells a story that takes place in a two-story building in Shanghai. An old landlord's eyes unfold the stories of various tenants, depicting the mysterious psychology of Shanghai people. There are dancers who earn a lot of money and are envied, couples who drive cars and are important people, and also unemployed poor wretches carrying heavy burdens. But the more important tenants are Wang Xianzai and Shu Xiuwen, a wonderful couple who win the aviation lottery and move from the front building to the garret to pretend to be poor! Hong Shen wrote the script, and Cheng Bugao directed.</p>
<p>"Spring Flower" to be Screened</p>
<p>Wu Cun's "Spring Flower" has completed the final scenes and is now in the process of editing. Once it passes censorship, it will be released.</p>
<p>In the sweet rhythm of the song "Spring Flower," Lao Gao's devotion encounters extreme pain, Yan Yuexian's stimulation leads to an unknown end, and Huang Naishuang is both loving the heartbroken man and rekindling his heart! Wu Cun hides a lot of tears behind these stories, saying that there can be no fire, no blood now,... The meaning, that kind of extremely painful meaning, is not difficult to guess. Pay attention to this noteworthy film.</p>
