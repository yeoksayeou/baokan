<p>— 禾</p>
<p>現階段日本的政權要苟安一時所可採取的方式不外下列三種第一以「昭和維新」爲名要求資產階級將「產業奉還天皇」三月十日「皇國經濟研究所」所公佈的「皇國經濟之確定」就說明着這種方式可是由「二·二六政變」的失敗可知這種方式目前是無法產生的第二和前者完全相反尊重資本的神聖權由資本家操縱政黨運用儀會政治恢復「九一八」以前的狀况這種「一木美濃部」式的政權隨「天皇機關說」的沒落而無法抬頭了第三以「非常時」之名拒絕政黨組閣同時亦抑制軍部的專橫標榜舉國一致調和各派的利益這就是齋藤和岡田兩內閣的任務稂據客觀情况廣田內閣的本質應屬於第三種可是他的施政方針却在上述三種以外他運用外交天才周旋於各派之間欲與元老重臣政黨財閥及軍部結歡喜綠終由利害無法一致之故形成了今日到處不討好的局面</p>
<p>爲着軍需工業家的利益廣田允許擴張軍備目的無非見好軍部然而軍部中陸軍的要求除軍費之外還有限制兩院權力成立航空省廢除拓植省及設無所任大臣等項這些要求是吾牴觸憲法姑且不論如果一一奉行首先要招致貴族院的反感從廣田內閣中貴族院佔三席和該院議員馬塲藏相是組閣參謀看來這些要求必然要被拒絕的</p>

<p>敎育部科長　鍾靈秀</p>
<p>三　今後推行識字遝動應改進的幾個方法</p>
<p>我國不識字民眾，的有三萬萬人，應受識字敎育。上項入了民眾學校已識宇的民眾六百七十九萬多人，不過占不識字人當中百分之二。七，尚有百分之九十七以上應受識字敎育的民眾，仍未受到識字敎育。所以，我們覺得識字運動允待積極推行。而且自民國十七年度至二十三年度七年當中，計共識字的民眾，不過六百七十力萬多人，平均每年不過百萬人，受到識字敎育，　果仍然照這種方法推演下去，必須一百年後，始能將三高萬文盲一律肅淸，這是何等嚴重迫　的問題。所以今後推行識字運動的方法，實有改善的必要，但是這種事體，爲重要，值得細密的研究和討論。幸希望　同胞，允其是敎育界同人，多加研究商討，以期得到一個最有效。最經濟。最澈底的好辦　，供政府的　用。垷在僅就個人意　，提出項數項來，和大家談談：</p>
<p>個人意見以爲普及識字敎育的方法，不外兩　步驟：第一步要舉行識字運動，作大規摸的宜　，使不識宇民眾，明瞭不識字痛苦和識字的重要；第一步，就要多開辦識字的處所如民眾學校，識字學校等，使一般民眾有識字讀書的處所和機會。但是除有固定時間課程等之嚴眾學校識字學校外，允應多設活動式的識字處所，如識字處。問字處。露天學校。流動敎學。幻燈敎育。挨戶施敎專方法或利用小先生制，家庭學生等辦洗，抱定「來者歡迎，不來者送上門去」的决心，使生活困難，時間缺乏的不識字的民眾，可隨時隨地，得到識字讀書的機會。此外義務敎育也要積極推行，雙方並並。因爲垷在的靑年和成年文盲，都是從前義務執靑不普及所遺留下來的，所以全國文盲逮到萬萬人之多。如果我國義務敎育早已普及，和歐美各國一樣，現在決不至有如許文盲。所以普及義務敎育，是掃除文盲的正本淸源辦法。不然的話，將來文盲還要一天一天的增加，識字運動，永無終止的日子。好在現在政府，對於普及義務敎育，和普及民眾敎育，都能够同樣蠶視，雙管齋下，實在是對症下業的根本辦法。</p>
<p>欲　到人人識字的　的，必須實行强迪，由政府下最大的决心，嚴厲督促，限期普及。其方法可就十六歲以上三十歲以下的不識字者先行强迫，作爲第一期。俟第。期辦完後，再强迫三十歲以上至四十歲者作爲第二期。第期辦完後，再强迫四十歲以上至五十歲　乍爲第三期。如此分期辦理，分別先後，人力財力，較爲經濟。</p>
<p>推行識字敎育，應有專鬥負責機關，負嚴厲執行及調査考核之資。此項機關，應與當地的行政機關，自治機關，軍警機關，密切聯絡，共商進行。敎育部會頒布各縣市民衆敎育委員會組織要點，可以査照組識，爲推行識字敎育的生持機關，籌劃一切協力進行。</p>
<p>不識字者有受識字敎育之義務，識字者有敎不識字人識字之義務，此項義務絕對不能免除。近年各地方有勞動服務團之組織識字的人，負擔此種勞動，最爲合宜，且可省却許多敎師經費，希望識字的同胞，努力服務，爲國家社會而效力，爲人羣謀幸福，這是大家義不容辭，而應該十分快愉去擔仟的天職。</p>
<p>規定文盲標準，凡不能寫自己的姓名。年歲。籍貫。住址。職業，不能看淺近書報，不會寫簡單普通信件者，都算是不識字的人，爲實施識字敎育的對象。我們應該分區調査明白，使他受到識字敎育。</p>
<p>以敎育郁編定之甲乙丙三種三民注意千課字，及敎育　所　定人　坊發行的識字課本爲敎本外，再調査各地方及各種職業人所需用的字，分別編輯各種字彙及識字常識課本爲補充讀物。其敎材應注意下列各方面：（一）須適合民眾生活需要的。（二）須適合民眾心理需要的。（三）須爲民眾經騐所接近的。（四）足以發抒民眾美感的。（五）足以修養人格的。（六）合於公民陶冶的。</p>
<p>敎育行政機關應鼓勵各書坊多編輯各種淺近讀物，令其廉價出售，使已識字者多多閱讀，並得繼續識字。溫習。進修。</p>
<p>凡不識字的，認字以後，傳授他人識字者，應按其傳授之人數和成續，給予獎勵。</p>
<p>在民眾學校已畢業之識字者，應規定繼續溫習及練習運用所識之字的辦洗。如寫信。看報。記帳。寫日記，閱讀民衆補充讀物及淺近故事小說等。由原來敎師指導，或另定指讓人員，以便已識字者，有繼續溫習進修的機會和便利。</p>
<p>積極推行識字敎育最困難的問題，一般人說就是校舍。師資。經費三項。但是我們中國，是一個窮國家，應該想出窮方法來，去埋頭苦榦，以達到肅淸文盲底目的。譬如說校會問題，我們不需要堂皇富麗的校舍，只需要借用各學校。團體。公共機關。祠堂。會館。寺廟等原有屋字爲校舍用不着籌措建築校舍的經費。再說師資，我們有四分之一的識字同胞，的一萬萬人，不識字的的三萬萬人，一個識字人，如果能够負責敎三個不識字的人去識字，此項　淸文盲的大問題，就可以解决了。</p>

<h3 id="c166">繼初級杯之後　優游又得字林杯　昨三比二決賽克聖芳濟　上半時優游二比零佔先 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>優游乙組足球隊自前週擊敗蘭開夏奪得初級杯後、昨日在申園又以三比二戰勝聖芳濟、獲取字林杯、是戰因雙方人材平均、球藝出色者甚多、故戰來頗爲努力、局勢甚爲興奮、上半時優游連中兩球、基礎穩固、下半時聖芳濟極力反攻、果亦還敬兩只、形勢頓時緊張、幸賴許文奎之機敏、使優游造成三比二之勝局、是兩隊亦去年該盃之决賽者、而錦標則爲聖芳濟得、兩年中各得一决、可謂公平交易、</p>
<p>連勝兩球</p>
<p>聖芳濟有福恩恩達耶及蘇石等葡萄牙名將、優游　有許交奎奚巧生張容等、中堅類連進、為未之趣好人材、雙方各抱必勝之心、攻守防禦、各盡其職、惟聖芳濟聯絡上未臻純熟、屢爲許文奎奚巧生羅斗文又攻陷防綫、許丈奎首開紀錄、奚巧生錦上添花、聖芳濟守門雖好、難免一失、優游後方、雖幾度受驚、卒被朱璆等保禦得法、保住江山、下半時起、優游繼續進攻、球勢仍盛、無如聖芳濟不甘屈伏、力圖恢復失球、曾當選　埠際代表之小將福恩、被楊金陵張監視極嚴、球勢側重中左兩路、葡萄牙健將恩達耶、闖進優游門前、張容於危迫之際、違法撞、被罰十二碼、由中堅勃兩臺踢進、　游　著呢文一度失機後、聖芳濟捲土重來、蘇石射球鬥前、福恩奔上掃射、王才高衝出救球跌地、球落一旁、華萊正在球邊、一踢入門、成各二平手、</p>
<p>最筆勝利</p>
<p>此後形勢、愈見激烈、優游自中央開球後、一鼓作氣、直搗敵營、雅任特盤球失誤、星星之火、竟成燎原、繼之巴洛廷同樣失策、許文奎東討西征、獲球射鬥、竟告中的、優游遂以三比二佔先、聖芳濟幾度進攻、顏連進保守中原、穩健老硬、即有幾次險球、王才高亦均化險爲夷、而聖芳濟門前、祇見優游前鋒諸將竄出竄進、守門技術不凡、救出險球無數、時間終了、優游遂報去年失敗之恨、而攫得字林盃、</p>

<p>優游乙對聖芳濟之字林盃决賽結束後、三時三刻起東華優游兩甲隊作西聯甲組賽本季第一次相會、東華李寗李義臣自前星期日與法商之戰受傷後、昨仍未能出塲、以致陣綫大爲調動、後方無人、起用曹秋亭及不出名之莊友仁、實力大不如前、中衛綫諸將、乃格外吃重、均能盡力應戰、前鋒則被　游監視極嚴、活動之機會甚少、結果優游以二比零獲勝、優游前鋒實一無可取之材、旣不能聯絡、又不能攻門、小黑炭幾已成爲廢物、遠不如前矣、優游守衛諸將、均有相當進步、允以江善敬最佳、爲目下滬上華人中最出色之內衛人材矣、</p>
<p>優游全恃　守　周密</p>
<p>申園看臺上僅三四千觀衆、分怖於四周、人氣已較往昔兩隊比賽時、整肅怡　、蓋兩隊競爭甚有禮貌、九十分鐘之角逐、禮讓往來、脫盡的火氣味、蓋兩隊球員、原屬一家友好也、東華開球後、優游前綫頗示軟弱無序之狀、東華頗佔　勢、腳頭爽脆、聯絡有方、陳德輝戴麟徑、先後攻門、江善敬滿身量胆、　頂腳踢、百無。失、張榮才亦曾救出不少險球、孫　慶屢次應　機射門、梁　棠寸步不離、監視極嚴、優游要非守衞　密、斯時恐不免有失利之虞、</p>
<p>東華先失　反攻劇烈</p>
<p>東華因單劇　方、內部不免空虛、鍾育　直前得球地位、曹秋　欲行不前、鍾乃從容傳向門去、許竟成處境甚佳、正得來球、乘勢打門、其勢甚猛、不料竟彈門楣而回、陳　祥　獲、撥與樹棠、梁拔足即射、穿入門角、淸晣可　、優游遂先開紀錄、不南諸將、繼續進攻、聲勢依然極盛、使優游招架不邊、成東華之　面倒形勢、卒以優游戒備嚴密、使東華無隙可乘、</p>
<p>局勢更急　優游再中</p>
<p>下半時起局勢羅為與　、雙方精神振作、競爭形勢、反較上半時激烈多多、陳德輝活躍非凡、為東華前鋒危險人物之一、一次猛射、張榮才斜撲救出、又一次可勝機會、惜踢成野球、小黑炭陳鎭和在上半時中竟滴汗未出、斯時亦大爲努力、幾决單槍匹馬、攻入東華門前、激動觀衆精神不少、可惜黑炭失去把握、不能操縱機會、結果功虧一簣而已、十五分鏡時、許竟成得鎮祥之傳球、轉送門方、陳鎭祥虛張聲勢、讓與勇森攻鬥、又告成功、</p>
<p>今日比賽　東華棄權</p>
<p>東華進攻寺、江善敬决　腳、讓張金海溜進待攻射、梁樹棠橫裹衝上、捷足先登、解脫此危、孫錦順亦有一决可勝之攻門、不料猛彈橫木而越後方、以東華攻勢之盛、竟不獲球、誠不幸之至矣、結果優游遂以二比零獲勝、今日兩隊原在逸園作第二次賽、因東華陣容不整、自願棄權云、</p>

<p>關於小學敎育者　　該省小學大都設備簡陋敎法陳舊、管理亦甚鬆懈、該廳亟應派遣督學前往各縣普遍視察、並令飭各縣主管教育行政機關擬具設　小學及分年推進計劃、以為改進之依據、　賓立小學、亟應逐年增設、在二十五年度內至少應在遵義及安順兩縣各設一校、　該廳應於二十五年暑假時、舉辦小學敎師講習會、令飭各縣、派遣小學校長敎員、及縣政府主管初等敎育行政人員到會聽講、以謀小學師資之改善、</p>
<p>二、關於義務敎育者　　該省省會設立之短期小學六所、學生數均太少、應令從速招足、又該校辦理成續、如何影響於全省短期小學者至鉅、並應隨時督飭認眞辦理、　本年虔該省各縣短期小學經費全數由廳按月撥給、業經核定在案、惟義敎經費、以由地方自籌爲原則、下年度之經費、應令各縣依照中央頒布之各省縣市籌集義務敎育經費暫行辦法大綱、　爲設法籌措俾利進行、　該省短期小學大多數係單獨設立、敎員既屬專任、其資格學力亦大致尚合、應並令設法兼辦鄉村民衆敎育、以資推廣、</p>
<p>三、關於中學及帥飾敎育者　　星期日各中學槪不得上課、此點須即令嚴格施行、至校中授課表各科之排列、亦須合理化、不得遷就兼任敎員上課之便、而將某一科之幾小時接續排在一上午或一下午、使學生感覺疲勞、减少敎學效率、　自然學科應有實騐敎員、應親自指導學生、須親自動手、並須有實騐報告、　器應設法擴充、敎應並應訂定統購置辦法、　中學師範敎員兼任過多、應遵照修正中學規程規定之兼任與專任比額、多騁專任敎員、各校敎員應由校長遵照規程、就合格人員擬定名單、送請敎廳核辦、再由校長聘任之、　敎員學生之缺席及遲到、慶嚴加取締、其辦法由教廳訂就、呈準本部施行、該省有省立中學應依照其經費之來源確定其立別、該省有雀立中學而由縣供給經費者、則應改稱縣立或仍稱省立、而經費由省庫支撥、　各中學校舍太壞、應有整個整理與建築計劃、並應切於實際而易施行、其爲軍隊借住之校舍、亟應設法收回應用、　省會中學學生、夜多遊蕩在外、應令各中學嚴格管理、學生須一律住校、如仍有放縱學生情事、應由校長負責、　全省師範學校爲數過少、應劃定師範區、逐年添設、以期、到每區一校、縣立中學並應酌改簡易師範與鄉村師範或附設鄉師班、以養成義敎師資、　現有省立貴陽師範及女子師範附小與師範本部聯絡甚少、應改進現有實習辦法、令學生多方參加附小行政管理及敎學、以資訓練、</p>
<p>四、關於職業　育者　　應遵照部定職業敎育經費應佔比率、並根據該省經濟建設狀况、詳擬今後發展職敎計劃、　應由敎廳斟酌實際情形、酌令各縣立中南　改辦初級職業學校、　省立初級　業學校辦理頗屬認眞、惟對於實習方面、應多關實習塲所、並與建設機關聯絡合作、以收實效、</p>

<p>工部局情報處云、公共租界中外私立學校、每年有遵照定章、向工部局請領補助金之舉、本年度此項補助余、外國學校方面、前由學務委員會組織補助金審查　員會建議、規定總數十六萬九千元、其中日　所辦學校補助金、佔十二萬八千元、嗣以本埠日本居留民團、復呈請增撥補助金六萬化千元、此議已於日前由學務委員會轉呈董事會核奪、嗣復經財務委員會本月十七日召集會議、討論之結果、决定建議於董事會於原定十二萬八千元（與上年同）之外、復增撥一萬　千元、董事會於星期日舉行例會之時、已將財務委員會增撥日童學校補助金一萬　千允之建議、加以批准矣、</p>
<p>至於華人私立學校、本年度應得補助金、亦會經華校補助金審查委員會主張、自上年之二十萬零八千七百六十元至二十四萬七千八百五十元、因本年度私人創立華童學校、新增三十七所、學生總數八千三百五十人、計增加百分之二十三有奇、擬亦與以相當經濟上之補助也、嗣財務處處長對於此議、僅允自去年度之二十萬零八千餘兀、併作整數二十一萬、其理由係因本年度財政拮据、各方面俱需　行緊縮、所幸者工部局各部俱能體景此意、已見相當成效、惟敎育處一九三六年費用、則反見增加、蓋該處除補助金一項之外、內部費用本年較之去年，已增加五萬一千元云、學務委員會則謂新增華校三十七所補助金之陳請書、旣經認爲滿意、原有審查委員會二十四萬七千餘兀之數、自不便再加以駁復、此議最後經財務委員會本月十七日討論之結果、復經財務處處長之同意、認爲在上年度補助金定額之外、再增撥一萬九千元、使其總額達二十二萬七年一百六十元、賬務委員會—席在此復提示公共胳膊　界教育經費、前已規定不得超過百分之二之總捐及地價稅之同等數目、現租界敎育經費、除現擬增撥之日童學校一萬一千元、及華校補助金一萬九千元不計外、已達一·八四（百分率）之總捐及地產稅之同等數目、若冉加入此决增撥之數、恐已達百分之一×九之譜、嗣經各委員恊議之結果、華人私立學校一九三六年度補助金、應即增撥一萬九千元、其總數遂為十十二萬七千七百六十元、</p>
<p>工部局董事會星期三日討論此事之時、某董會提議應使週知者、即目前租界敎育經費、已將達前此所規定最高額（即百分之二之總捐及地價稅之同等數目）、故嗣後一切私立學校、已不得再因局方有補助金之頒發而逐漸增加、須知此後有因請求而獲得經濟援助者、即須自現有補助金各校、所已得者之中攤給也、因此董事會主席復建議將臆此所有之定章、今再加以確認、即公共租界敎育經費、連同一切補助金在內、不得超過百分之二之總捐及地價稅之同等數目、以上各項補助金增撥之數、遂獲通過云、</p>

<p>— Lluisa　M　Alcott　原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「不，我想你剛才所指的那個童子，他所娶的那位秀婉的婦人，對於他的造化，遠過於他少年時所遇見的僿野的南恩；或者更進一步，那聰明睿智賢母般的婦人常常在暗暗管護他，像小梅管護小橋一般，是最有關係於他的成就了；蜀說時，回顧她的母親，她是坐在梅格的近旁，看去已充滿了老年人溫良懿淑的威儀，勞笠便給以孝敬的一瞻視，同時以十分懇切的態度回答道：</p>
<p>「她們三位都是大有造於他的，我現在可以了解這些女孩子對於你的童子必是很有帮助的了。」</p>
<p>「郤也沒有多過於童子們帮助她們的；這是相互的，我明白對你說。乃德用他的音樂帮助着小梅不少；唐恩管理南恩，比我們任何人要好；小橋敎你的金鬈兒，毫不費力而效果甚爲美滿，茀力子竟稱他們爲亞士楷和甄葛蘭。（註十二）啊！可惜！假如世上的男女，能够相互信托，了解，帮助，我的孩子一般，這世界是多麼一個好地方呢」！蜀夫人說時，眼睛裹有一種恍惚的情形，好像她是在看到一個美妙的新社會，其中的人民愉快而天眞地共同生活着，像她在梅莊裹的一羣孩子模樣。</p>

<p>— 君明</p>
<p>牛頓生於公元一六四二年十二月二十五日，他是一位科學家，一六六七年發明三稜鏡，又曾發明迴光天文鏡，而死於一七二七年，活了八十五歲，關於他的童年生活，非常有趣的。</p>
<p>他因爲從小沒有父母，所以就住在舅舅家裏，他雖是苦兒，但對於任何一物，都發生「爲甚麼這樣？究竟爲甚麼那樣？」許多懷疑的態度，後來發明上述各種，就是有很大的影響。</p>
<p>有一天，他獨自一個在花園裏散步，看見了有一隻蘋菓，從蘋菓樹上落到地下來，你想這件小事，又很平凡，沒有多大奇怪，可是這位科學家牛頓小朋友，說來眞是奇怪，他却偏是不肯輕易放過，心中就想道：「爲什麼那蘋菓不向天上落呢？或向旁邊落下去？而垂直落下來呢？」最後便被他發現，就是所謂「地心吸力」的作用，萬物都被它吸引。小朋友！你要注意呀，科學發明家，都是從極平常的，共他人所不注意的東西裏研究出來的學理，就在乎對於萬物注意與吾。</p>
<p>又有一個笑話，他在那天早晨，正在研究的當兒，有一傭人，拿了雞蛋與鍋子，進來燒早飯，牛頓說：「你把雞蛋和鍋子放在這裏好了，我自己會燒」。後來他自己去燒了，再定了數十分鐘，那鍋子裏的水，已經沸了，他以爲鷄蛋熟了，那知揭開一看，而是不雞蛋，却是是一隻錶，在沸水中打滾，你想：他是何等的專心呢？眞所謂心無二用哩！</p>

<p>德國徐柏林廠最近造成一隻大飛船，預備常川飛航大西洋。那隻飛船的設備，簡直像一個「空中旅館」。</p>
<p>這飛艇分上下兩層，下層包含二十五個房間，可以載五十個乘客。每個房間設兩個榻位，冷熱自來水管，一個掛衣的壁廚，一寫字桌。此外有一座容三十客的膳廳。上層是一個吸烟室，一個浴室，一個洗面室，一所廚房，一個船員休息室，一間儲藏室。</p>
<p>這架飛船將在今春定期航行，每决航程二日，旅費每客四百金元。</p>

<p>— 張亦菴</p>
<p>因爲它的相貌和性格的關係，貓頭鷹是給人家憎厭的，並且把它當作兇險的象徵；在西洋，則貓頭鷹有哲學家和陰謀家之號。的確，它的尊容果然不同凡鳥：頭大，眼大，面頰小，嘴尖鈎，頭上兩綴毛，彷彿一雙耳朶，（其實那不是耳朶）。它的頭的上半，由毛角到雙眼的那一部分，確是有點像貓頭，我們叫它作貓頭鷹，倒是一個象形的叫法。在字典裏，它的本名叫作梟。（圖A）</p>
<p>它的唯一的特殊品性就是晝伏夜出，並且乘黑夜捕食弱小的鳥類和其他動物。有時夜深人靜，我們聽見半空中有「居哩居哩」飛嗚而過的，許多胆小的人誤認作鬼叫的，其實就是它老先生出巡。它趁着弱小的動物好夢方酣的時候，突然地來襲擊，來搜捕，以果它的腹。</p>
<p>你或者會問：在黑夜裏，它怎看得見呢？這就是它所以有一雙大眼睛的原因。它不但看得見，並且能從高處遠處處看見我們所看不到的東西。它的眼睛雖然有與貓眼相同之處，但是亦有相異之點。相同的就是彼此都能在很暗的地方看見東西，瞳孔都能够很靈活地放大或收小；相異之處就是貓的瞳孔收小的時候是由一個縱的橄欖形而收至像一條很細的縱綫（圖C—），貓頭鷹的瞳孔收小時仍然是圓形的（圖C）。當它看暗處時，購孔就放得很大，大得同整個眼球差不多（圖B），但是遇到光綫强烈的時候便　小得比一粒火柴頭更小。它的瞳孔的　造和作用是同攝影機鏡頭的光圈一樣的道理的：攝影機鏡頭的光圈遇到要在較暗的地方攝影時便要放大，遇到攝影光綫強烈的景物時，光圈便要收小，這樣所以調節收得光綫的分量。貓和貓頭鷹的瞳孔作用完全同這一樣的道理。人的瞳孔也有同樣的作用，不過能率和靈活遠不及它們。</p>
<p>貓頭鷹所捕吃的，除小鳥之外，像老鼠，甚至蝸牛也吃的。它的羽毛和別的鳥的不同，是輕而柔軟的，所以飛起來沒有拍撲的聲音，而且構造特殊，不会因風吹而發生聲響，否則它所要捕的小動物一聽見便會躱避了。</p>
<p>本埠的兆豐公園的動物園近日有一隻活的貓頭鷹，在養烏的屋子內的一個角落裏，小朋友們如巢有便的話，大可以去觀察一下，與這篇文章所述的互相參證。</p>

<p>— 周起鳳</p>
<p>當我們旅行上海天津漢口靑島各大都市的時候，滿目所見的；是廣關平坦的馬路，整齊堅固的樓舍，往來如梭的車馬，一切都盡量的表現出現代物質的文明。但這都是租界上藉外人所經營的成續，一出租界以外，便有相形見絀之感，使你會驚奇得以爲是另一個世界。只有廣州，完全是靠國人的力量，建造起來的一個繁榮都市。而人口的稠密，工商的繁盛，市政設備的完善，也沒有一樣比不上滬津漢等地。如果我們不以為倚靠外國人為榮耀的，那　，中國第一大都市，應該讓給廣州。</p>
<p>雖然，廣州的繁榮榮耀，也不是單開人為的，天然的力量，地理的環境，也夠使廣州繁榮了。廣州的地位，是處於珠江三角洲的在帶，是一塊極肥，是沖積平原。又當西，北，東三江的入海口，餘額漢，廣九，車廣三，三鐵路的起始點，如果沒有香港的障碍，廣州的前途，眞未可限量啊。</p>
<p>廣州是革命的發源地，黃花岡七十二烈土墓，總理紀念堂，都巍峨地使人肅然起敬，想起先烈的堅　卓絕的奮鬥精神，看看目前的國家情況，　的是感慨萬分！</p>

<p>環繞在我們周圍的一切事物，眞是神秘極了！機器的代人做工；發電機的發生電流；火車的疾馳；飛機的飛行；無綫電的傳聲和傳影；礦工能從礦山裏，開出金，銀，銅，鐵，錫，煤等等；那些印刷工人，能够印出千千萬萬本的書報，和各種各樣的顏色畫圖。我們再向田野裏一看；五穀能够生長結果；一粒下種子，能够長出一顆大樹；形形色色的昆虫，時生時滅；以及魚，鳥，花，草；天的下雨打雷；日月星辰的運行；四季的變化不停。眞是無奇不有，說也說不盡。這一切環繞在我們周圍的神秘事物，都有一種吸引力，吸引我們去研究牠。因為牠是神秘而有趣的，許多科學家便被好奇心所動，終年終月的去追求牠們了</p>
<p>要懂得這些神秘事物並不難，我們只要肯下工夫去研究便行。我在這裏，將繼續把這些神秘的科學知識，有系統的寫下去，特別注意有的小試騐。當你動手幹了這些試騐之后，便能慢慢地踏上科學之門來了。</p>
<p>第一個神秘的事情</p>
<p>許多東西，並不常常和牠的相貌相同；當我們一看見牠，就覺得牠奇怪的時候，應該細細的來考究牠才行。例如，我們並不能把一塊鐵，變成別地東西。可是假使你把一柄雪亮的小刀或光亮的鐵片，浸入某種藍色藥水裏的時候；拿出來一看，忽然變成銅的了。這是多末奇怪！原來那種藍色藥水，是硫酸銅溶解在水裏做成的，而硫酸銅又是銅溶解在硫酸裏做成的。所以那種藍色液體裏有銅，奇怪！鋼刀變成銅的了！當眞有這回事麼？不過看不出來吧了。當你把鐵浸入之后，有些銅便沉澱在上面，所以當你把牠拿出來一看，鐵面上鍍起一層亮光光的銅，好像變成銅的了。從前，大家把銀的器物上，鍍上一層金，就說這個器物是金的了。實施上，是把一塊銀子浸在一種酸裏，把銀溶解了之后，就鍍上一層金子。這吿訴我們一個簡單的法則，就是這一種金屬不能變成另一種金屬。</p>
<p>環繞我們周圍的許多東西，都使我們看不見牠的眞面目；就好像在藍色的硫酸銅裏，看不見銅一樣。比方，城市裏的小朋友，常常看見人家用煤氣點燈或燒飯。這種煤氣燈裏，就隱藏着煤。你可以來做個小試騐：倘若你放一些煤在大德长烟斗裏（例如鄕下人吸潮烟用的長烟管），而把烟斗放在酒精燈或爐上燒。如果把烟斗上面蓋牢，只讓管出氣，立刻就有氣體從煤裏發出，開始從烟管頂端流出來。擦根火柴，就可以把這種氣體燒着。這氣體是怎麼來得呢，爲什麽會燒得着？原來，奇怪！管頂上的烟燒着了！氣體裏就隱藏着可以燃燒的煤，還有一個奇怪的事情，是遺留在烟斗裏的，那黑色的膠狀物，我們把牠叫做煤焦油的，還可以做成美麗的染料。</p>
<p>用來造飛機和飛艇以及其他的鉛，就隱藏在普通的泥土裏呢！世界上的許多東西，並不常常和牠們的相貌相同，這是很神秘的事。　（本文挿圖三幅，下期補刋。）</p>

<p>兒童之間是沒有甚麼界限的，所以兒童們都是不必介紹的小朋友。</p>
<p>在家庭的當中：兄弟姊妹，不但因為聚首的時候多，並且因為同胞手足的關係，所以這是最密切的小朋友了。</p>
<p>在學校的當中：男女同學，大家互相研究學問，一處運動遊戲，這又是互助的小朋友了。</p>
<p>在社會的當中：貧賤的兒童的富貴的兒童，彼此都是相親相愛，一點也不存歧視的觀念，這可說是平等的小朋友了。</p>
<p>在世界的當中：無論黑種白種，黃種，紅種，也許成人都在斤斤計較着種族的界限，造作着種族的戰爭，但是兒童們却只知同年的友愛，而不知種族的分別；這可說是自然的小朋友了。</p>
<p>兒童之間是沒有金錢，勢力，……這些妨害眞正的友愛或者造成虛偽的友愛的東西，所以兒童的友愛是最純潔的，也是最偉大的。</p>

<p>我是一個十二歲的小學生，當七歲的時候，我的媽就送我到鄕間學校裏去讀書，那是我不過讀些「人手竹刀尺」和「哥哥弟弟妹妹」等類的書，讀了約二年光景，九歲那年的五月裏，我家搬到上海來住了，過了一個暑期。</p>
<p>在七月初時學校秋季招考的時候，爸爸就替我到萬竹小學校裏去報了名，次日領我大批校投考，那時我初到上海，膽子很小，加之上海學校，比鄕下大不相同，上海市校大生多，當投考的時候，嚇得來要死，結果竟沒有取。</p>
<p>這時我只好居家不讀，我想上海讀書，眞不容易，還是還到鄕下去讀罷，我正在灰心的時候，那我家樓下二房東家的丙哥上樓來，看見我面露不快的樣子，他就問我爲什麽不快活，我就將考不取的事吿訴他，那丙哥忙對我說，「我們再做兒童畫的時代，無論做甚麼事！不成功，不該就灰心，要努力上進」，他又說「失敗即成功之母，萬步可一失敗就灰心。」我聽了丙哥的勸吿，這半年中，在家溫習舊書，遇有不識和講不出的字句，問問爸爸，怎樣一來，到了十歲那年，春季裏再去投考，倒就考取了，我心中非常快活，回想丙哥的話眞不錯，我們兒童不該灰心。我讀到今年，已升入中級組的甲組了，現在我拿自己的經過寫出來，希望全國的小朋友們，無論做甚麼事，倘遇失敗，須要努力奮鬥，「不要灰心」才是。</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>小愛洛實在是村中最富的一個孩。伊既沒有兄弟，有沒有姊妹；伊那件藍絨布的衣服上，從來沒有窟窿。當伊第一次參加聖餐禮時，伊那柔軟的頭髮上，還戴着一隻富麗的梅克林花邊做的軟帽，是伊德祖母和母親小時節所戴過得。伊雖只十二歲，而村中的一半男子已很注意於伊，以為將來很可以給他們的兒子做一個賢妻的。但是小愛洛是一個天眞爛漫的小女孩，並不知道自己是怎樣的出身，平日間伊所最愛的小朋友，常在一塊兒玩耍的，便是小南洛和他的狗。</p>
<p>伊的父親柯甘士，也是一個很良善的人，不過太嚴肅了一些。有一天，他走到廚坊後面的草場去，就撞見了他們三個同在一起。</p>
<p>他的小女兒愛洛正坐在一堆乾草中間，那伯德希的黃褐色的大頭，正擱在伊德身上，伊們的四周環繞着許多罌粟花和藍色矢車菊的花圈；而那孩子小南洛，却拿了一根燒焦的樹枝，在一塊平滑的松板上，給伊們倆在盡像。</p>
<p>那磨坊主人瞧着這所畫的像，眼眶中不知不覺的來了兩滴眼淚，原來這畫像中的面目，畫得和小愛洛十分相像，而他是極愛他們女兒的。當下他對小愛洛呵斥了一聲，推說伊德母親正在喚伊。小愛洛很是害怕，一面哭，一面就趕到屋子裏去了。柯甘士回過身來從小南洛手中取過了松板，微顫着身體說道：「你爲什麽做這樣沒有意識的事情？」小南洛紅了臉，低下頭來，輕輕地答道：「我是喜歡看見甚麼畫甚麼的。」</p>
<p>柯甘士默然了一會，然後拿了一個法郎在手中，伸出來，向小南洛道：「我說這是一件沒有意識的事情，白白地浪費了光陰；然而你畫得活像小愛洛，伊的母親見了也一定歡喜的。拿了這一個銀幣去，就把這幅畫送給我吧。」</p>
<p>小南洛臉上的紅雲都退去了，抬起頭來，把兩手放在背後，悄悄的說道：「柯甘士先生，您把這錢和畫都收好了吧。您是想來待我很好的。」於是他叫柏德希過來，一同穿過了田野，回家去了。他一面走，一面對柏德希喃喃地說道：「他老人家雖把那法郎送給我，但我决不能受，因為我是不願出賣伊德畫像的。」</p>

<p>— 鐘震</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰犧牲了無量數的生命與財產的結果，是造成了德意志民族賣身契約的凡爾賽條約。這條約經過德國十餘年的不斷掙扎，己逐步為它所撕毀了。最初由賠欵的减低到完全停付，繼後由希特勒登台自動宣佈重振軍備，由蕯爾投票收回了戰後失地，最近更直接派軍隊進駐萊茵河的非武裝區域，更澈底地破壞了凡爾塞條約。凡爾塞條約己被撕毀大半，甚至德國版面地自由行動和否認其義務情形下，可以說完全等於廢紙了。現時德國所尚未達到解除凡爾賽條約所强加於它的束縛的，只剩下東歐方面被割讓於波蘭等國的舊土未得恢復，只剩下被割讓和轉移給戰勝國的海外殖民地未得收回而已。然而所有這些己不是德國是否繼續遵守凡爾賽條約的條約義務問題，而只是它的現實力量能否完成其志願的問題，事實上用不着再談什麽國際條約的束縛力了。</p>
<p>萊茵河非武裝區域，這是在凡爾賽條約中規定了「德國不得保有或興建任何防禦工事」「不得於此暫駐任何軍隊，亦不得於此區域作動員之準備」的。在凡爾賽條約簽定以後，英法等國曾為了監視和强迫德國履行條約，榨取賠欵，駐兵於此。後來英法撤退萊茵河駐兵，原不是　為德國不堪這種壓榨而引起了社會的窮困與不安，大有由此引發革命的恐怖之可能，所以這兩個帝國主義國家才允許减低賠欵並撤退萊茵駐軍的。自然，這中間也還有英國己存心要逐漸回復德國勢力，以防法國之坐磊興俄國之西進的作用在。但也就在這時又成立了所謂羅加諾條約，在其中重申德國，於萊茵區域的義務，再給德國拴上一條鐵鍊。並且規定如果德國違反了凡爾賽條約和羅加諾條約，各國應共同行動以資互助。所謂互助云云，實際上不過是主要的為了防止德國在萊茵區域恢復武裝和　　法國，以此來保障法國的安全的。</p>
<p>但是，現在呢？自從德國自動地宣佈重振軍備，因此具有相當實力後，即於本月七至八兩日，完全不採取協商態度而自動的調動大軍，浩浩蕩蕩地開入了萊茵河非武裝區域。據現有的德軍人數總計起來，在該區域內己有了六萬大軍，而德國飛機的翱翔，大砲高射砲的裝設，隣法，比，荷蘭等邊境的砲臺的重建等等，己逐步加緊實行它自己的計劃，不顧任何抗議與非難了。因為如此，所以法國也積極地調兵遣將，忙於充實它的邊防。而且德國還乘這緊張局面的展開，採取一種威脅的姿勢，表示出如果誰要執條約權利以干涉它的自由行動，即出於流血戰爭一途，亦在所不惜的樣子。因此全世界的注意力又都集中於這一事變了。大家都認它比意阿歐洲帝國主義國家間所掀起的風波還要大，空氣還要緊張些，大有戰禍立至之感。因為意阿戰爭無論如何嚴重，它還只限於在菲洲的殖民地爭奪上，而德國恢復萊茵區武裝則係在歐洲帝國主義內部的直接衝突的擴大，在歐洲大陸燃起了火藥庫爆炸的引綫了。</p>
<p>照此次德國在萊茵河非武裝區域重振軍備看來，表面雖似乎委緊張的，但在實際上却未必會立即以此發生戰爭。甚至這一事變發展之最後結果，恐怕將來大有使西歐的緊張空氣被轉移到東歐方面的可能。因為希特勒之派遣軍隊入萊茵區域，並宣佈不遵守羅加諾條約的義務，是以反對法俄互助協定為口實的。他認為法俄協定係一種對德的軍事同盟和大包圍的敵對行為，因而德國即無遵守羅加諾公約的義務。當然，德國的這種宣稱不過是一種借口，是一個烟幕彈而已。他的眞意乃是想在此借口之下，完成其在舊德意志領土內能恢復它的軍事佈置之絕對自由，而撤廢戰勝國對它的任何條約的束縛。因為，在事實上，法俄協定的本質在法俄兩國都只能說是防禦的而非進攻的，法俄兩國實皆沒有對德發生任何領土的野心和進攻的可能。因此，只要德國不再進一步威脅法俄，與法俄共同對德作任何軍事侵　使絕不　實況。這在德國也並不是不知道的。可是德國明知如此，而仍必以法俄協定為借口，不顧條約地直接派兵進駐萊茵河，這其中自有它的深意存在。</p>
<p>我們分析德國的這種舉動，應該明白它的原因並不僅僅限於要恢復萊茵河上的武裝一點，而且還有削弱法俄協定對它的東歐政策所加的束縛和壓力的用意在。事實是很顯明的。法德的現存的絕對對立的狀態，大家都並不是不知道它們相互間想起一種什麽領土的野心是不可能的。所以在西歐方面，德國的志願至多不過只在要求回復萊茵區的戰備狀況，使它成為德國的完全主權之自由的領土就够了。可是法國却連這一點小惠也吝而不與，所以就造成了兩國間的不可調和的矛盾。在德國，因為收回海外殖民地和割讓給波蘭等國的失地，這是會帝國主義之發展的對象，就必然選擇上了俄國。然而法國却因懼怕德國坐大之故，用法俄協定限制其發展，這就使德國痛心疾首，不能不亟求西歐的矛盾根源之毅然的斬除，以使利其東歐政策之進行。因此它一方面遂以毅然的行動完成其帝國主義生存之必要的願望，取消條約所加於它的萊茵區域的束縛，他方面且企圖以此消减法德間爭執不休的對立因素，以使進上步和法國成立相對的協調，而達到破壞法俄協定的效力。這我們只要看德國在恢復萊茵區的武裝之後，立即提議訂立各資本國家間的互不侵犯條約，連英，法，比，意，波蘭等等都在內，獨不及於俄國，以及提議重訂羅加諾條約，西歐天空公約，以期除去法國的不安之猜疑等等，就可明白。</p>
<p>當然，德國的這種要求，在法國仍因恐怖德國坐大後之將來的危險而不願意，所以德國在萊茵區恢復武裝的問題也立刻引起了德法間的嚴重局面。但是事實上法國恐終將屈服就範，甚至被逼要和德國相當恊調，以减低其對法俄恊定的擔負。因爲德國不但以戰爭來恐嚇它，使它在未能得着英意的援助之下不敢不屈服；而且因為英意間的矛盾，旣使英國害怕德國出而為意大利的聲援，不得不拉住德國，又因英國對俄始終願意抬出一個德國來防範它，也必須買好德國，所以素來英國就是暗中贊助德國之西歐天空公約的主張，想在西歐撤去法德間的對立的。困此，英國這次不但不會積極出來反對德國在萊茵區域重振武裝的毀約行動，甚至還要從中作調人，施壓力於法國，使之逐漸接收德國的羅加諾公約之再訂，西歐天空公約之創立，乃至互不侵犯條約之設立等等主張。至於意大利，現在原是以非洲殖民地搶奪為其目前所最關心的事，它只能在萊茵區問題的堅張空氣下，來為自己的利益而要挾，絕無所補益於法國的立塲，這己由它現所表示的冷淡與中立態度可以證明。如此　法國在萊茵區問題上將是孤立無援的，旣不敢獨立以武力去懲罰德國的赴約，最終只有逐漸軟化妥協而就範。如果這一事實的發展達到了德國的主張的實現，即在英國的調和，贊助，甚至施壓力於法國的形勢下而實現，那麽由萊茵區恢復﨣所引起的緊張空氣，假使不致在這裏偶然地爆發戰爭，便宜會移轉到東歐方面去，這是它的發展之可能的前途。</p>

<p>綏遠包頭通訊</p>
<p>綏遠是個地廣人稀的地方，牠的面積在現在的所謂華北五省中是最大的，但人口的分配平均每方里却只有二人。土地非常的貧瘠，若與內地的蘇浙諸省比較起來，簡直可以稱為不毛之地，所以從來就引不起人們的重視。自從東北四省淪亡和以百業廟為中心的內蒙自治問題發生之後，這綫引起了國人深切的注意。最近由於政治，軍事和外交上的關係，牠的地位更顯得非常重要了。因此，每年到這裏來旅行的調查的人們便絡繹不絕地往來於平綏</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>道上。</p>
<p>這個地方因爲北西南方都靠近沙漠地帶，所以氣候寒暖的變化非常的劇烈。在冬季固然很酷寒，卽使在夏季也往往午間炎熱而晚間寒冷，因此，平常的植物是不易生長的。一般的生產情形也非常的落後。大部份土地是尙未懇殖的草地，只有一不部份經營著農業。一般人民的主要生產就是利用草地經營牲畜。在牲畜業中，牛羊的生產固然是大宗，而馬也佔着很重要的地位，因此，綏遠的馬也就馳名全國了。</p>
<p>近代的交通工具雖然大部份是以機械爲中心，但在落後的中國，馬在交通和農作上仍佔着極重要的地位。尤其在軍事上，牠的用途是更其重要的。綏省當局爲了獎勵馬的生產和馬種的改良，每年舉行一次產馬比賽會，以示提倡。每屆會期，綏省的各縣和內蒙的各盟旗都熱烈來參加，這樣，更一年一度形成漢蒙兩族的盛大集會。</p>
<p>產馬比賽，在每年的雙十節由省政府主持辦理。參加比賽的單位是各縣和各旗盟就先在各單位內舉行預賽，把「馬選行」選出，然後再集合到省城來參加比賽。比賽的地點是在綏遠省會的歸綏縣運動塲。歸綏縣分新舊兩城，東西對峙着，相距約有五六里。這個大運動塲就在兩城的中間。此地因爲氣候的關係，樹木是很少的，所以這個運動塲只是一個平漠的巨大荒原。平日很少有人到此地來運動，因爲除了爲着賽馬而建築的兩個看臺和簡單的賽馬跑道外，別的什麽設備也沒有。不過在雙十節的前後幾天却不同了，紅男綠女，萬人空巷的都集合在此地，參觀這每年一次的盛大竸賽。這固然是因爲塞外人民對於與他們有密切關係的賽馬特別發生興趣，而平常很少有這樣集合的機會，也是主要的原因。</p>
<p>在競賽的幾天，本地的居民，各旗盟的蒙古人，有的騎馬，有的坐車，有的步行，都集合在這運動塲的周圍。除了漢人之外，其中有滿口「官話」的旗人，有拖髮辮，穿紫袍的我們蒙古人，而最引人注意的還是滿清袍褂，頭帶珠飾的蒙古王公和貴族婦人。這賽馬會同時也就成爲人種展覽會了。</p>
<p>竸賽的期間是三天，要是遇着天氣不好或竸賽未完，也可以延長幾天。大槪前兩天是預賽，最後一天是决賽。馬的種類是不同的，一般分做跑馬，走馬，種馬三種。跑馬和走馬從幼小時卽按着馬的性質分別訓練着跑或走。種馬是未成年的幼馬。竸賽時也就按照這三類分別舉行。</p>
<p>竸賽的方法是把各種的馬分成各組，個別的舉行。由發令員，評判員指揮評定。跑馬和走馬的距離是不一樣的。跑馬的距離是二華里，走馬的距離則衹一華里。這兩種距離所用的時間大槪都在二分十五秒到二分二十五秒之間，很少有二分二十五秒以上的。不過，這速度也就算是很可觀了。</p>
<p>比賽結束之後，便按照名次發給獎品。獎品中銀盾，優勝旗等固然也有，但大部份是馬鞍，馬鐙之類的。有時地方當局對於跑第一的馬也給予獎金，或賜以優異的名稱，如「綏風」「馳電」等。</p>
<p>善於騎馬在游牧生活中是很普通的。不僅成年人是如此，就是兒童也非常擅長。在某一次的產馬竸賽中，有一位獲得跑馬第一的騎士，年紀不過綫十二三歲。在我們蒙古人中，騎馬更是很普通的，幾乎成爲日常的必需活動。成年人不必說了，就是十五歲上下的青年男女，在草地上一方牧馬，一方騎馬飛奔的追逐着游戲也是常事。他們騎馬，通常是不用鞍韉的，而又是未經訓練過的野馬。往往前面的男孩子騎馬飛馳地跑過去，女孩子便抓住馬　，轉身上馬在後面追趕。在廣漠的草原上形成一副天然的圖畫。</p>
<p>這裹所產的馬除了一部份供作本地交通，農作之用外，大部銷售於國內的各軍隊中。每年有很多的人來此採購。在歸綏和包頭有很多的馬店。採購的人到這裹後，便有「馬販子」來兜攢生意。一切的食宿都歸馬店招待，他們便四處去運馬來任你選購。</p>
<p>馬的價格沒有一定。普通未經訓練的所謂野馬，大槪每匹在四五十元左右。如果是經過訓練，而又是很出色的，價格就很難說了，幾百元以至千元是不等的。如某次賽馬會獲得跑馬第一的「綏風」，卽以千元的價格爲人購去。不過這種馬大都爲愛好馬匹的富有者所注意，普通的顧客是不大問津的。</p>
<p>在此地放馬也很需要資本。在春夏秋各季固然可以在草原上「放青」，在冬季就必須購買草料來哺養。而管理馬羣的「把頭」和訓練馬的「馬師」也必是專門的人材，其工資銷耗也是很可觀的。</p>
<p>塞外的景物根本與內地不同。在別處桃紅柳綠，鳥語花香的時候，此處則是青草漫野，牛羊成羣。牧人手握着長鞭，高踞在馬背上，口中喊出種種指揮畜羣的呼聲。再加上塞外特有的朔風，遠處童秃的羣山，便繪成一副雄偉的圖畫！這無怪「風吹草低見牛羊」這句詩成爲歷史上描寫塞外景物的名句了。</p>
<h3 id="c217">焦棗 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 老圃</p>
<p>山西涿縣通訊</p>
<p>涿縣以產「焦棗」著名。所謂「焦棗」，係用火烤製，酥脆香甜，味極可口；行銷於本省及華北一帶，每年不下數百萬元，涿縣貧民靠這過活的約四千餘人。去年棗收豐稔，銷售亦旺，所以經營焦棗者大都利市三倍。製焦棗的塲所，俗稱作坊；衹要見到門首掛有用空心焦棗穿成的各種圖案標誌的，便是製焦棗的作坊。這類作坊計有三百幾十家，其集中地大都在西城一帶，也有散居在四鄉的，但那不過是一些零星小戶而巳。製棗時期，每年從初冬起，至次年二月底止，工作僅有四個月左右；一到交春，因氣候關係，便不能再從事烤製了。</p>
<p>製棗方法，係在普通的屋子內，用土磚砌成長約一丈五尺，寬約三尺的爐灶一座，上掘火眼五六個不等，然後將預先已除木核的空心棗子平鋪在一張鐵絲鋼上，放到火眼上面燒烤，稍隔數分鐘便移動一次，使火力平均，歷時約一點鐘左右，焦棗就成熟了。這種方法，最初看去好像簡單，其實非富有經騐的好手，誰也不敢担任這種職務的。據內行的人說：烤製焦棗，在上火時，如果移置不勻和火候不準，棗味就難適口，所以担任這種職務的大都是作坊的中堅人物。焦棗在烤製以前，尙有一種挖核手續，這項工作，多屬婦女充任；每家作坊僱有挖核婦女約三十餘人，工資每天約一角五分左右，總計各作坊挖核婦女約有九千幾百人之多。所以在棗收豐稔的年歲，一般貧民的生計便可以不致發生什麽問題了。</p>
<p>焦棗銷路，在過去交通不發達時，除供給本縣食用外，其餘都用舊式獨輪車運銷各縣銷售，銷路最遠的也僅祇達到本省的邊界；但近年以來，因交通巳不如往昔的阻梗，所以華北各地巳都有這類焦棗出售了。且因去年焦棗豐收，售價極廉，頭路焦棗每百斤由八元跌至六元左右，其餘如二三路者，則僅售三四元而巳；所以本年開春，涿縣焦棗銷售之旺，爲歷年來所僅見的奇蹟。民國十六年傳作義被困涿縣時，因糧食吿罄，曾以焦棗果腹，吃後大加讚賞；據說今春派某秘書到涿縣，購辦了數百斤而去。</p>

<p>每冊售價五分，生活書店總經售</p>
<p>我因爲想求得一些關於健康的知識，所以特定了一份「康健世界」來看。這刋物的內容的確是適合我的需要的，我在看過幾期之後，關於飲食起居的衛生法則，關於治療各種時病的常識，都得到了不少。現在，這刋物已經出到第五期了，我爲了實際地祝「業餘」讀者諸君健康，所以特地在這里把最近出的這第五期「康健世界」約略介紹一下，這想來對於一般希望健康的朋友是有意義的吧。</p>
<p>在「康健世界」第五期中，首先的一部分文字是一般地談康健的重要和保持康健的方法。如萍的「市民的健康問題」，柳塘的「保持健康的十八字」與夫襄侯的「享樂與勞動」等文皆是。內中「保持健康的十八字」最爲精彩，這里提出了「吃得好，着得好，住得好，吃得下，撒得出，睡得着」十八字作爲保持健康的基本法則，並對這基本法則作了活潑有趣的說明和具體的規則。其次是更具體地討論强健身體的實比分方法的，這可特別舉出吳蘊瑞的「强健身體之方法」來。這篇文字是連續上期——第四期登載的，如能將上期和這期前後兩段合起來看，那確是可以得到許多實際的在日常生活中的衛生知識。在這個之後，還有「康健的家庭」·「體育圈」·「醫藥春秋」等欄。其中如「蜜月旅行與康健原則」，「我能夠活幾歲？」，「種牛痘的常識」，和「述學太極拳經騐」以及「醫藥廣吿的道德問題」，「死」，「溫溫發白痘之病理與傷寒發熱原理」，「外科藥劑檢討槪述」……等文，也都値得細讀。這可以吿訴你一些性的知識，可以使你知道一些如何鍛鍊自己的身體的法則，可以使你得到一些病理和科學的常識，能對付某些疾病的來臨。</p>
<p>此外，還有一些小東西，如「康健格言」，如「珍聞一束」中的「母女爭產」，「紐絲倫大風」，「南菲降雹如砲彈」……這幾篇，也是値得注意而且俱有興趣的。</p>
<p>經濟往來</p>
<h3 id="c219">最近世界樹膠生產和消費槪况 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 品成</p>
<p>在經濟恐慌期中，一切物品都表現出了嚴重的生產過剩的狀態，那用途最廣，產量最多的樹膠，當然也不能逃出這個命運之外。因此，前年六月世界各主要生產樹膠國乃成立國際樹膠限產協定，以限制樹膠的出產。去年南洋更有人主張星期休息，據云這辦法有這樣幾點利益：「一，根據永久成功之天然根本律：二，對於歐籍與土人之大小樹膠公司均獲公正之待遇：三，爲使供求平衡之根本限制主法，對於車主與工人之身心兩蒙其益，生理學上新陳代謝之原則，對於樹膠亦有利益，且產樹膠當因之增加。」其實這主張的根本意義，一句話說完，只不過是在企圖再行限制南洋的樹膠生產。在這樣的人工的生產限制下，最近世界的樹膠市場的確有了相對好轉的現象，同時，又因爲近年來世界各國的狂熱地擴張軍備，特別是在這下面的汽車景氣的發生，使得世界的樹膠需要也　急度增加中。這樣，一方面是生產的限制另一方面又是需要的增加，結果當然是要引起樹膠市場的相對好轉的。</p>
<p>實際上，世界各主要生產樹膠國在去年和今年間所存的樹膠現貨就在日益减少中。例如美國，主要地因爲它本身的需要增加，在去年中樹膠現貨就减少了約六萬餘噸。此外如英國，在去年九月末樹膠現貨巳增加到十七萬七千噸，但在本年一月末却减少爲十六萬二千萬噸了；海峽殖民地和馬來等處，如將近幾年來的情形合起來看，其樹膠現貨也有相對减少的趨勢。現在，爲要更明白問題起見，我們可以引出如下的關於最近世界各地樹膠現貨情形的統計數字來（單位千噸：</p>
<p>依據上表，我們可以知道：一九三四年與一九三三年比較起來，世界樹膠的消費增加了一〇九千噸，但同時生產更增加了一三六千噸，所以結果是一九三三世界樹膠生產較消費多（生產過剩）五九千噸，一九三四年更多出八六千噸了；但一九三五年與一九三四年比較起來，世界樹膠的消費僅增加了一〇千噸，可是因生產减少了一五〇千噸，所以結果表現出了消費超過生產七四千噸的供不應求的狀態，這原因很顯然地是在於一九三四年成立了國際樹膠限產協定，限制了樹膠的生產量。</p>
<p>然而，就在國際樹膠的限產中也表現出了許多矛盾現象。最顯明的，如荷領東印度的土人樹膠輸出統制就很困難。這是因爲：第一，如不行土人樹膠園的調查或土地登記，對於各生產者的輸出即不能行比例的限制；第二，國際限產協定對於荷印土人的樹膠輸出的比例規定太少，按照限產協定的規定，在一九三五年土人樹膠的輸出許可額是十一萬二千五百十六噸，但實際的生產却在這三四倍以上。在這樣的輸出統制困難中，近年來荷印土人的樹膠輸出在實際上都超過了許可量，其情形如下——</p>
<p>荷印政府對於這種情形當然是很苦惱的；在沒有辦法限制土人的生產和輸出的增加情勢下，去年第一期荷印政府曾要求增加土人的輸出額，但因爲當時世界所存的樹膠現貨還有增加的趨勢，所以未得各生產國的承認。結果荷印政府只有再向土人進攻，迭次提高輸出稅。及至去年底，由於世界樹膠市場的人爲的好轉，國際樹膠統制委員會在十一月例會中才相當增加了荷印的輸出量，同　也就相當地增加了荷印上人的輸出額。然而，因爲種種情况都是人爲的限制生產所造成，所以在根本上仍未解决問題。</p>
<p>有人依據過去的情形估計：本年世界樹膠消費約爲百萬四千噸，平均每月爲八萬三千七百噸。在這中間，世界各國的消費額大致如下（單位千噸）——</p>
<p>依據這個估計，本年度世界樹膠現貨還有再减少的可能，從而樹膠市場也許還能繼續好轉。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>但是，樹膠生　的限制首先就要影響到工人生活。拿荷印的情形來說，在沒有實行膠限以前，膠工所獲工資，每天多在一元以上，且工人大有缺乏之勢，但在膠限實行後，各樹膠園不得不紛紛辭這工人，問時並减少工資。這樣一來，一部分膠工便須離開工作地，另謀生活；另一部分因工資减少，生活當然也更加緊迫了。結果使各樹膠產地的小販乃至一般商店失掉了大量的賞主，因而市面蕭條的情形也就更加深化了。依據這種表現，我們可以知道由於人爲地限制膠產，做成樹膠市場的好轉現象，結果是影響到了社會的別的產業，使不景氣在別的產業中更加深化，使多數的勤勞者的生活更加痛苦，貧窮化。所以，最後說來，樹膠生產和消費的最近情勢，仍然是目前畸形的世界經濟狀况中所產生的一種畸形現象。</p>

<p>— 香草</p>
<p>目前文藝刋物除老牌「文學」外？幾乎看不見了。「夜鶯」是一個小型的文藝刋物。從創刋號看來，各欄都有平均的支配，說是內容豐富，也非過譽之辭。</p>
<p>不過，五篇漫談中，沒有一篇抓住現實的——對國家，對民族的有益的問題；唐弢先生的「論『非常時』一雖較有意義，但也只空泛地說了幾句。固然傅××之流的橫蠻應該罵，但總沒有帝國主義的侵略那麼慘酷罷！</p>
<p>創作方面，王任叔先生的「霧」是從側面描繪出中國農民生活的慘影。農民不能生活，便把當兵做「出路」，可是當兵與自己的理想很遙遠，於是想「逃」，但是逃上那里去呢？「回到老家」嗎？而「守田土的又都在挨餓」，一句話，「逃不了死」！所以狗食人肉也是司空見置的了。在目前，在民族垂亡的目前，我們是迫切需要决死的勇士，但我們却不需要鬩墻的英雄。這一篇無論在意義上，在技巧上都是一個完整的作品。莊啟東先生的「失業者」，雖然他着重在失業者尋找職業的心理的描寫，但「碰壁」之後，沒有給他留下應有的覺悟，而且過於單純，不能算是構成了一個故事。方之中先生的「一羣叛逆的女性」，這是一個報告文學的樣式，他在一羣女性中單提出一個參謀的女兒作主角，把那位應當是典型的柳格非反而作了陪　，這也許有他的用意在。我在作者許多作品中發見了兩種特質：第一，他所不歡喜的人物便用刻毒的筆鋒來嘲誚；第二，把人物的性格混揷在動作和言語中。共次，還運用着漫畫的筆法，促進故事的發展。在這一篇里依然保持着這種風格。至於時代意義的評價，讀者自會知道。三篇散文中，東平先生的「聖者的預言」好像一個寓言，文字過嫌彫琢，反將意義模糊了。奚如的「從寗晋到石家莊」只能算是一篇遊記。羅烽的「手提琴底乞討者」是寫哈爾濱一個白俄流浪者，懷念舊時的豪華，悲傷現實的殘酷、記得這個題材，蔣光慈曾寫過「麗莎的哀怨」，因爲對於主人翁感傷的調子太重，結果反而做了她的同情者。在本文內，作者也犯了同樣的毛病。白曙和石榆是雨位年靑詩人，所以他們的熱血，義憤，都奔泛着，激盪着在他們的詩句里面，這和現代派，新月派從文字上來裝飾是有天上地下之別的。兩篇理論文章全是翻譯，但前一篇正是目前中國文壇上的「康福多」。中國文壇上有一時是盛行過內容重於形式的偏見的，而形式與內容究竟有何關聯？在這篇文章內全告訴我們了。後一篇譯得太生硬，而且這問題也似乎不十分重要。介紹非戰作家托爾斯泰，我以爲這是非常重要的，雖然托氏在中國靑年們面前是一位很熱識的作家。現在全歐和遠東的風雲已到了最險惡的時機了，極殘忍的第二次人類大屠殺便將要呈現在我們的面前，我們需要像托氏那樣偉大的作家是毫無疑義的。庸衆先生的「議魯迅的『故事新編』以後」，正如作者所說自己「不是批評家」，「假如誰要把它當作批評，『是不免威到失望的』」。中國的批評家太少了，公正的批評家允其太少了。批評家的任務是指出作品的優點和劣點，讓鑒賞者鑒賞，後學者學習或警戒。但中國的批評家（就僅有的說罷）不是狂捧，便是謾駡，公正的批評百不得一，這實在是目前中國文壇上最嚴重的問題。</p>

<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>居列·波爾德（Jules　Bordet）不僅是比利時著名的偉大醫學者，而且就在現代世界的醫學界中都是値得特別注意的人物。他於一九一九年曾獲得了諾貝爾醫學獎金，從此他在醫學上的成就更得廣播世界，而他本人也就確然成爲國際的醫學者了。</p>
<p>這位偉大的醫學者於一八七零年六月十三日生於比利時的Soignies，現任布留塞爾大學細菌學寄生虫學及流行病學敎授，兼巴斯特爾研究所（Bruserpasteur　Institut）所長。他不僅有一般醫者的技術方面的知識，而且對於生理學，醫學，特別是流行病學的學理都有深刻的研究。他的容貌是很和靄的，一見就可看出是一位溫厚篤學的學者。但是，他的幼年生活，我們無從考察，而且也好像沒有多大考察的必要，所以，現在，主要她是想介紹他的研究及其成果，這應該是較有意義的。</p>
<p>波爾德博士最重要的研究是血球溶解現象和補體結合現象，以及痙攣咳病菌發見這三者。他是從一八九五年開始研究的，那時他已二十五歲了。就在這前一年，德國法凡爾已發見了虎列刺菌在上撥鼠的腹腔內溶解，消失的事情。這在醫科學上名爲法凡爾反應。波爾德對於這件事情當然特別注意，他在自行實際地試騐之後，知道了這種現象是土撥鼠的血淸的作用，依他的試騐，如以虎列刺菌實行免疫處置，可不限於土撥鼠，其他動物的血淸也同樣能使虎列刺菌溶解的。</p>
<p>就在這個試騐中，波爾德把握着了免疫的本體。於此他特別注意赤血球。他實騐的結果是，如果取甲動物的赤血球去注射乙動物，以之代替病菌，行所謂免疫處置時，那便會表親出乙動物的血淸有溶解甲動物的血球的力。這就呌做溶血球現象。這種實騐是使用赤血球去代替病原菌，所以完全沒有危險，而且試騐方法也很簡便，其成效在一二小時內卽可明顯地表現出來。波爾德博士便由此次第地完成了免疫現象的分析，研究。要說現在的免疫學說是由他的研究發端，這頁並不是故意誇大的。</p>
<p>在上述的赤血球溶解作用中有兩個物質作用，其一是由免疫處置在新的動物的血淸中表現出來的，這在波爾德博士名爲感作物（Substance　sensibilisnforius）。另一個則有溶解赤血球的直接作用，是存在於普通動物的血淸內；這種東西，名爲亞勒克辛（Alexin）。我們通常說的血淸治療，便是人體注射免疫動物之血淸而治療的辦法。這樣，所謂免疫，想來已可明白了吧。</p>
<p>波爾德博士發表溶血球現象後，隨着研究這個問題的，是德國的愛爾黎。他的見解與波爾德的說法有許多不同點，因此他們曾大起論戰，這是在十九世紀末期的學術上値得特別注意的事。</p>
<p>波爾德博士認為在虎列刺病菌溶解中主演的亞勒克辛和在赤血球溶解中德亞勒克辛乃是一物（此時亞勒克辛已改名爲補體（Complemet）了），所以他又特別注意到了這個問題：卽如果爲溶解虎列刺菌，一旦補體消滅了，那在此就是加以赤血球，也不會發生溶解現象。隨</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>着他更應用這種補體結合發見了痙攣咳病菌；他的研究的素質之偉大，從此才算眞的顯示了出來。</p>
<p>在波爾德博士應用補體結合發見了痙攣咳病菌後，德國瓦塞曼醫者用以來行梅毒診斷，因此瓦塞曼的聲名也就廣播世界了。但據有識者看來，在學問上波爾德的聲名是純金的，瓦塞曼的聲名祇不過是鍍金的罷了。</p>
<p>現在，我們還可以略談一談波爾德博士所發見的痙攣咳病菌。所謂痙攣，可說是一種神經病；這種病的狀態是筋肉的急度收縮，卽一般俗稱的扯筋。患這種病者可說都是小孩。病勢有緩急之分，急性者約在數小時內卽可結束一個小小的生命；而且病人的傳染性也頗强，所以說來是很危險的。但這樣的小孩急性傳染病人的病原何在，向來還不知道，直到波爾德博士才發見了在患這種病症的小孩的咽喉中培養了一種細菌。然而，要舉出這發見的證據却很困難，因為事實上不能拿一個活的小孩來試騐。於是波爾德博士便應用了上述的補體結合產品騐。他所培養的痙攣咳病菌，便宜是由於應用這補體轉向作用，而明白證明痙攣咳之原因的。他的這種發見己得到了世界學者的承認；同時，由於他的發見，所謂痙攣病症的預防和治療才樹立了一定有效的方針。這對於人類眞不能不說是一個偉大的貢獻。</p>
<p>波爾德博士有一個女婿，名呌Ｇengou，也是一位湛深的醫學研究者，科學家。他是波爾德博士的助手，在血球溶解現象及痙攣病菌的研究上他頗努力；對於博士的研究當然也有很大的帮助。他現在比利時衛生局技師，很活躍，將來的成就正未可限量的。</p>
<p>最後還要報吿一個消息：本年七月將在倫敦開的第二次國際細菌生物學會，這裏說的波爾德博士是被推為這個國際會議的名譽會長了。單就這一點看來，博士在國際醫學界，科學界的聲名和地位也是可以全然想見的。</p>

<h3 id="c222">「三十年後」 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>近來憑了一點靑年的火氣，在故鄕作了一次破除迷信的行動，因為在那一個城圈里，也像別的城圈一樣，總不少有閒的紳士，他們為了要排遣有閒的日子，不知是否為了「天外飛來的靈感」，竟為濟顚和尚着了迷，設了乩壇，讓一般愚夫愚婦們來探詢因果，求治疾病，居然「業務鼎盛」。但後來那般老紳士的行為愈來愈荒謬了，於是我們卽呈請縣府予以取締，可是道路喧傳，都說那個扶乩機關不久卽將改為佛敎分會。其實宗敎與迷信决非一體，我們對於宗敎雖無成見，却堅决地反對迷信。為要明瞭這一件事的眞相，特地去問佛敎分會的主持人某國學大家，承他誠懇的吿訴我們：他並不參預乩壇事，而却说：「三十年前弟亦曾努力破除迷信，但佛法廣大精黴，乃近竟不敢置一詞。」我聽了這幾句話，不禁毛骨悚然，「三十年前」，這是一個如何可怕的時期啊！</p>
<p>這里的問題是：為什麽三十年前他們曾同我們一樣努力破除迷信?為什麽佛法的廣大精黴處在三十年前不會發現，而必要在三十年後發現？</p>
<p>我是知道那位國學家的意思的：你們現在不要徒憑靑年的火氣，鬧什麽破除迷信，三十年後恐怕你們也要沈默不再說話了。假使我的猜測不錯，那我將很感激他的好意，這是一個前事之鑒。</p>
<p>我們鄕下本來也有一個老故事，說：某靑年在一位拳師那里學了三年級武藝，自以為本領非凡，天下無敵了。一天，鄕村里演社戲。鄕下有一種「擠頭臺」的風氣，擠頭臺就是憑一己的　力，擠到臺前去看戲，沒力的人唯有站在人頭後面，得不到好位置，所以凡鄕村中有　力要面子的靑年，往往都要去擠頭臺的。當然這位靑年勇士也得去臺前擠擠了，那知自以為天下無敵的勇士竟被別一位　力更大的人打倒了。他很懊喪，很覺醒，知道自己的力量還不行，於是閉門養晦，別求名師，再學三年，技能更高，而自信力竟日漸消失，連拳脚都不敢任意揮動了。這故事，老人們常常拿來作敎訓我們的材料的，並且還附帶的念了一則口訣道：「初學三年，到處去得，再學三年，寸步難行。」那位國學大師大槪也自以為是「再學三年」的人了，當然，我們的破除迷信只是「初學三年」的毛頭小夥子罷了。</p>
<p>上述的故事其實不能作為我們破除迷信的事的譬喻，因為那是似是而非的。多學了三年，認識了世上有更大的學問和技能，使他感覺得自己學術技能的未足而努力求知，這誠然是不錯的，但若為了佛學內容的廣大精黴，用迷茫的眼光去仰視丈二金剛，自以為永遠摸不着他的頭腦，卽不敢破除迷信，這實在並不是眞的感於佛黨內容的淵博，而是年老血衰缺乏勇氣的象徵！</p>
<p>中國是一個早衰的民族，年未老耄，對世事都早己抱玩世的態度了。還有一種「未老先衰」的靑年人，也似老年人一樣的抱遁世的態度。那位國學大師所說的「三十年前」，也許還算日子略為久遠的，環視四圍，十年滄海，怕都早已變成桑田了！那些三十年前革命的偉人，至三十年後的今日，竟有不少人感於佛法廣大精徵而皈依佛法了。至於我們，大槪還是「三十年前」時代的人，不知到「三十年後」的時代，我們也將皈依佛，皈依法，皈依僧否？</p>

<p>— 益</p>
<p>「今天沒有發生意外，可說我們盡了保護的任責。」他驕傲的向眾人一次巡視，「不過，營長有命令，呌我帶回捐欵－－」他兩眼用力的釘住我，「八十元。」</p>
<p>「捐欵」和數目字說得特別　亮。我不十分明白鄕的情形，不知要怎樣回答。可喜二哥走了上去很嚴重的說：</p>
<p>「官長，我們的『喜酒捐』早已繳過六十元了。」</p>
<p>「喜酒捐了喜酒捐，這是『保護捐』。」</p>
<p>「我們並沒有請誰保護，也說不上什麽『捐』。」二哥忿然的說。</p>
<p>排長把臉一沉，馬上現出兇惡的神色：</p>
<p>「那我不管，這是『公事』。」</p>
<p>「鳥的『公事』，明明欺詐…」</p>
<p>排長不等二哥說完，便是一個耳光打來，隨又厲聲的說：</p>
<p>「你究竟拿不拿？」</p>
<p>二哥這時不知哪里來的勁兒，忽然撲上前去，操着斬釘截鐵的口氣：</p>
<p>「錢是沒有，要命你就拿去！」</p>
<p>排長把斜皮帶一扯，右手提起手槍，「好！你敢違抗公事。」跟卽把頭一歪，對着旁邊的兵士，「來！把他綁回鎭上去！」</p>
<p>於是幾個如狼似虎的兵馬上把二哥抓住，其餘的端準槍，彷彿快要掃射。膽小的客人都急忙的往後躱避，家里的人都捏手捏足的在門邊張望。我知道這事的結局並不嚴重，但多少總要化幾個錢纔得了事。於是勸開了二哥，要求排長不必動怒。客人中比較膽大的，也來帮着講好話，排長許可了不帶走，但是錢要馬上繳淸。結果經過我們再三要求，好像和解人命官司一樣，纔說妥了「捐欵」三十元，外送士兵烟茶費十元。最後，母親悲切切的捧出四十元，由我交給排長。他淸了一下數目，很平和的說：</p>
<p>「這是營長的命令，兄弟不過奉公辦理而已。」</p>
<p>兵大爺把錢拿走後，全家的人都像失掉了魂魄，二哥有氣無力的倒在竹椅上，胸口一張一弛的好像呼吸快要閉塞一樣！</p>
<p>不久天便昏黑，而弟弟的喜事也就沉沒在黑暗中了！</p>

<p>Mutinous Soldiers Disarmed Separately by Sui Army; Rumors of De Wang's Movements Are Absolutely Untrue</p>
<p>Beiping: Ao Yunzhang, acting secretary-general of the Bailingmiao Mongolian Political Council, arrived in Beiping this morning. According to him, after Yun Jixian and Zhu Defu led a group of staff members and three to four hundred members of the training team in a mutiny, De Wang, in order to resolve the mutiny and connect the feelings between Mongolia and Sui, specially sent him to Sui to visit Fu and discuss everything. It has been resolved satisfactorily. The mutinous soldiers have been disarmed separately by the Sui army, and the number of guns is being checked. Regarding the handling of Yun and others, the central government has sent a telegram to the Sui provincial government to instruct them on how to handle it. The security of the Bailingmiao Mongolian Political Council is currently maintained by troops from various banners and troops sent by De Wang's residence, and it is very peaceful. De Wang is temporarily acting as the chairman because he is serving his mother's illness in the banner. Rumors that De Wang has moved are purely rumors. After arriving in Beiping, he will report the truth about the Mongolian Political Council to all parties, stay for a few days, and then return to Bailingmiao. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Due to the severe snow disaster in the Uxin and Liang Leagues, the Mongolian Political Council has decided to telegraph all parties again within a few days to appeal for disaster relief, as the people's food supply has been cut off and cattle and sheep have also died. According to Bao Yueqing, he went to visit Chairman Song on the evening of the 20th because Chairman Song went to Baoding on the 21st to report on the situation in Chahar North and ask for instructions on the negotiation policy. According to Song, the Chahar North incident still needs to be resolved diplomatically by the central government, so it is not being actively pursued at present. De Wang has decided to assist in everything under the diplomatic policy set by the central government to facilitate the early resolution of the incident. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Opinions on the Draft Amendment to the Organic Law of the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Establishing an Accounting Office to Build the Foundation of a Chief Accounting System</p>
<p>Changing the Status of Foreign Employees in the Auditing Office to Employees</p>
<p>Nanjing: A reporter recently visited a legislator who participated in the review of the draft amendment to the Organic Law of the Ministry of Finance to inquire about his opinions on the amendment. According to him, this decision on the draft amendment to the Organic Law of the Ministry of Finance has an accounting office, a chief accountant is established, and is directly responsible to the Chief Accounting Office, building a solid foundation for a detached chief accounting system. In the future, the issue of accounting independence for various financial institutions can be easily resolved due to the guidance of the Ministry of Finance. This reform is indeed a major progress in our country's administrative organization. In addition, in the old system of our country's salt officials, in addition to the Salt Affairs Administration, an auditing office was also established for supervision. Later, due to the incompetence of the salt affairs administration officials, the auditing office even had the power to administer actual affairs. As a result, the auditing agency became the actual salt administration agency, and there were many foreign employees in the office. It is tantamount to foreigners supervising our country's administration, which is a shame for the country and the nation. Former Minister Song and Minister Kong reorganized this abnormal system and changed the status of foreign employees in the auditing office from supervisors to employees. This draft amendment reaffirms the spirit of Song and Kong's reorganization and makes clear provisions in the clauses of the organic law, so that foreign employees serving in the Salt Affairs Bureau in the future will be no different from ordinary employees in law. This reform can make the national tax collection agency more rational and orthodox. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Implementation of Anti-Smuggling Measures in North China; Japanese Misunderstandings Have Been Resolved; Smuggling Changed to Loading Cars in Yangliuqing and Other Places; Customs Urges Jinpu Railway Bureau to Assist Again <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: Nishida, the Japanese consul in Tianjin, ordered Consul-General Kawagoe to visit Chen Juesheng of the Beining Railway Bureau on the 20th to inquire about the anti-smuggling measures signed between the Beining Railway and the Tianjin Customs and to express the Japanese side's opinions. Chen told him that the Beining Railway was only in a cooperative position in this matter, and the focus was still on the Customs. The new anti-smuggling law was to protect tax revenue and complete the customs barrier, and there was no discriminatory intention towards foreign countries. The implementation area was limited to the Dongzong and Tianjin stations, and all foreign goods from outside were handled in this way. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to the Beining Railway, there are no diplomatic problems with the anti-smuggling matter in North China after negotiations. Although the Japanese side had misunderstandings because of this, the truth has been explained and the misunderstandings have been resolved. Within the scope of the conditions signed, the railway will assist the Customs, and all foreign goods from outside must be reported and inspected before being shipped. There will be no exclusive treatment for certain goods or certain countries. ((21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin Customs implemented the new anti-smuggling law on the 21st, and the whole day passed smoothly. However, smugglers have changed to using cars to connect and cross the Tianjin station. It has been found that cars are being loaded at the Yangliuqing, Cangxian, and Machang stations of the Jinpu Railway. The Customs urged the Jinpu Railway Tianjin Office again on the 21st to forward the request to the General Administration to instruct all stations along the line to assist in the anti-smuggling. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: With the assistance of the Beining Railway and the Jinpu Railway, the Tianjin Customs began anti-smuggling on the 21st. However, there are not many merchants who report and verify foreign goods for resale. The merchants seem to be waiting and seeing. In addition to the anti-smuggling special commissioners, the Customs also sent eight people to the Dongzong Railway Station to handle the stamping of the transport documents. According to Customs, although it is planned to continue to discuss the anti-smuggling measures in eastern Hebei with the railway, April 1 is the date for the major movement of Customs personnel. How to contact them? Even if there is a scale for discussion at this moment, the decision will be made by the successor, so the implementation is pending. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: To prevent smuggling of foreign goods, the Dongzong and Tianjin stations of the Beining Railway have implemented the previously announced measures on the 21st, and there have been no unexpected disputes. Because the Jinpu Railway has not yet printed the transport vouchers, the Customs will inspect the goods before transporting them. At the same time, the Customs has learned that some merchants have not sent the goods to the inspection factory for inspection before transporting them to the station, so it has specially sent additional foreign personnel to the station to perform supplementary inspection procedures.

<h3 id="e12">Review of the Policies of the Hirota Cabinet <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>At the current stage, the ways for the Japanese regime to survive for a while are no more than the following three: First, in the name of the "Showa Restoration," it demands that the bourgeoisie "return the industry to the Emperor." The "Determination of the Imperial Economy" announced by the "Imperial National Economic Research Institute" on March 10 illustrates this approach. However, as can be seen from the failure of the "February 26th Incident," this approach cannot be produced at present. Second, completely opposite to the former, it respects the sacred rights of capital, and the capitalists manipulate the political parties and use the political apparatus to restore the situation before the "September 18th Incident." This "Ichiki Minobe" style regime cannot raise its head with the fall of the "Emperor Organ Theory." Third, in the name of "emergency," it rejects the formation of a cabinet by political parties, while also suppressing the arbitrariness of the military, and touts national unity to reconcile the interests of all parties. This is the task of the Saito and Okada cabinets. According to objective circumstances, the essence of the Hirota Cabinet should belong to the third type, but its policy guidelines are beyond the above three types. He used diplomatic talent to mediate among various factions, wanting to be friendly with veteran ministers, political parties, financial groups, and the military. However, due to the inability to reconcile interests, it has formed a situation today where it is not pleasing to anyone.</p>
<p>For the sake of the interests of military industrialists, Hirota allowed the expansion of armaments, and the purpose was nothing more than to please the military. However, in addition to military expenses, the army's demands also include restricting the powers of the two houses, establishing an aviation ministry, abolishing the colonial ministry, and establishing ministers without portfolios. These demands contradict the constitution, not to mention that if they are followed one by one, they will first incur the resentment of the House of Peers. Judging from the fact that the House of Peers occupies three seats in the Hirota Cabinet and that Senator Mamba, the Minister of Finance, is the cabinet staff, these demands will inevitably be rejected.</p>
<p>The Minseito Party, as the first party, stands side by side with the defeated Seiyukai Party in the temple. Chairman Machida and the defeated Suzuki jointly wander outside the cabinet. Even if it is said that this is for the sake of national unity, the Hirota Cabinet used the beautiful name of selecting the wise and the capable to exclude political party members from serving as "political affairs officials," and also changed officials on a large scale in the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. This measure inevitably makes political parties feel chilled by the difficulty of obtaining funds for future elections, and makes those "young bureaucrats" who formed during the Saito Cabinet era indignant.</p>
<p>Japan's electricity is controlled by the Tokuden and Toho companies. West of Shizuoka is Toho's territory, and east of Shizuoka is Tokuden's sphere of influence. The struggle for power between them has created the political history of the Taisho era. The participants in the melee include the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Koshu financial groups, as well as politicians such as Wako Shohachi, Ohoka Ikuzo, Adachi Kenzo, Goto Shinpei, and Ito Jidaiji. When the Seiyukai is in power, Tokuden sings loudly; when the Minseito Party comes to power, Toho is ecstatic. Now Raimu Kinji (Minseito Party) unveils the nationalization banner, preparing to engage in electricity control with a capital of 1.5 billion yen. This policy, in addition to a few related large financial groups, such as Kobayashi Ichizo (the entertainment industry tycoon) centered on Mitsui, etc., is clearly dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Mamba, wanting to work hard on "voluntary control by the people" at the request of the army, rejected the large financial groups from taking the opportunity to concentrate capital. His aggressive issuance of public bonds and tax increase policies were immediately revised after being hit by the stock market crash. However, Kabuto-cho, the center of speculation, has not yet been relieved of the air of distrust of the current cabinet. In view of the fact that bonds have fallen abroad to the lowest level at the end of May 1933, even the military's Kokumin Shimbun complained that "the people's hearts are shaken as a result of the new Minister of Finance's rashness" (12th) and admitted that "the total market value of securities nationwide is 21 billion yen, and the current decline of 10% is about 2.1 billion yen. This is Kabuto-cho's evaluation of the Hirota Cabinet" (11th). When Mamba convened financial leaders on the 14th to explain, the president of the Bank of Japan, Fukai, a disciple of Takahashi Korekiyo, replied with a mocking tone. The serious situation of the conflict between the Minister of Finance and the president of the Bank of Japan is still not enough to touch the heart of the Minister of Home Affairs. He and the Cabinet Investigation Bureau are buried in making laws that "disregard the power of capitalists" (Mainichi 15th), plus the burden of increased taxes mostly falls on the shoulders of small and medium-sized capitalists. From this, it can be seen that most of Japan's property owners are dissatisfied with the Hirota Cabinet.</p>
<p>The House of Peers, which the current cabinet is trying to please, has only gained the support of some senators, while others are taking a monitoring attitude to hope for Hirota's "purge of the military." Since the military is dissatisfied with Hirota, then what is the effect of the "purge of the military" is a question.</p>
<p>A regime that gives dissatisfaction to the existing forces is able to cope with it and actually get support. This is due to the rapid advancement of the East Asian market monopoly. Therefore, we can say that Japan's current attitude towards China's diplomacy is the life-saving elixir of the Hirota Cabinet.</p>

<p>Tokyo: Japan's finances have been expanding all the way since Showa 7, and the budget for the 11th year has reached a huge number of 2.278 billion yuan. The increase in national defense spending is particularly large, accounting for half of the total budget. The Hirota Cabinet has already stated that it respects the policy of enriching national defense, so it seems to have decided to expand the budget, and the total budget for the 12th year will definitely exceed 2.3 billion yuan.

<p>Tokyo: The army authorities agree with the Hirota Cabinet's administrative reform, tax system reform, and financial policy, increasing revenue to implement active policies, innovate national politics, and enrich national defense, and hope that the government will avoid drastic policies when reforming finances to avoid affecting the financial community. The general public should also bear the responsibility of emergency, so in addition to increasing tobacco prices and postage fees, mass taxes should be levied to share the responsibility.

<h3 id="e18">Sir Wyld Lectures: U.S. Neutrality Policy Cannot Stay Out of the Far East <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>London: Sir Wyld, an expert on Far Eastern affairs who once served as a political advisor to the Chinese government, gave a speech on the U.S. neutrality policy at the "Social Problems Committee" last night, stating that from the perspective of Britain, the neutrality theory advocated by the United States is very important. On the one hand, the United States is eager to stay out of various world problems, and on the other hand, it deeply knows that it cannot stay out of the situation, or it is afraid of being unable to stay out of the situation, and it is difficult to make a choice. Taking the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia as an example, the new neutrality law recently promulgated by the United States is a temporary measure, which runs counter to the traditional U.S. policy of freedom of the seas (that is, free trade with belligerent countries). It can be seen that the so-called neutrality of the United States in European events means staying out of the situation. In the events between the Pacific Ocean and China and Japan, it will inevitably be changed. However, if a war breaks out in Europe, if the United States stays out of the situation and insists on the policy of freedom of the seas, disputes will arise between Britain and the United States. The only good way to avoid this danger now is that Britain and the United States can cooperate in advance to maintain collective security. Unfortunately, this kind of cooperation has not yet been seen, so there is still the possibility of disputes between Britain and the United States over the rights of neutral countries, which cannot be ignored.

<p>The Japanese government has not yet replied to the Russian protest reported by Bo Li. On October 21st of last year, Soviet citizen Boge Moluofu was arrested on false charges and subjected to torture and murder by Japanese military police and White Russians in Harbin.

This was the response they made at the Manchuria Police Station when the Soviet Consul General and the Harbin Consul requested Mr. Bao's release. Definite evidence has been obtained of the torture of other arrested Soviet citizens and the murder of Mr. Bao. The Soviet ambassador to Japan protested to the Japanese government as early as January 21st of this year regarding the illegal arrest and abuse of Soviet citizens by the Japanese military police, and requested a detailed investigation into the matter of Boge Moluofu, asking that the Soviet government be notified of Mr. Bao's true experiences and whereabouts.

<p>London: German Chief Representative Ribbentrop told British Foreign Secretary Eden today that Germany cannot accept any proposals for resolving the Rhineland issue if it cannot enjoy equal treatment.

<p>Berlin: According to a senior official of the German government last night, after closer review of the memorandum from Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy regarding the Locarno Pact, the overall situation has deteriorated since noon. The wording of the document tries its best to protect the Treaty of Versailles and is definitely not a bridge to a peaceful solution. The first impression of Berlin upon receiving news of the proposals from London was far from pleasant. The establishment of a demilitarized zone on the German border is not in line with the principle of mutual equality. The German public cannot understand the meaning of foreign troops stationed on German soil. As for the international conference, in addition to considering the proposals put forward by Hitler, a large number of other plans and proposals must also be resolved, which will be cumbersome and will inevitably waste time and achieve nothing. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Hamburg: Hitler delivered an election speech here today to 50,000 people, saying, "I am now fighting against the oppression of other countries to fight for equality.

<p>Hamburg: The news that Führer Hitler would come here to give a speech suddenly spread here this morning, and the atmosphere in the city suddenly became active. All sectors were busy preparing for the welcome. At noon, Mr. Hee arrived and the people cheered as if they were there. Mr. Hee then went to the lecture hall to deliver his speech on international events. Mr. Hee first recalled the hard work of the government in the past three years, and then asked the people to pay attention to the importance of this decision election. Later, he said that Germany's actions have attracted the attention of world public opinion. During this period, the government urgently needs the unanimous support of the people of the country as a backing. For this reason, he now wants to apply for a national referendum. Although he is pleased with all the achievements of the government, he still hopes that the people can help him fight externally so that other countries will no longer dare to despise Germany. Germany is not satisfied with amending the text of the articles. It deeply hopes that the hearts of the people of all countries who have despised and feared Germany for the past seventeen years since the war can seek a thorough reform. Germany has now put forward its peace plan to all countries in the world. If all countries still try to bind the German people with articles, it is naturally unacceptable, and how can all countries only blame Germany for forgetting their own obligations to the articles? (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Hamburg: Führer Hitler delivered a speech here today to 40,000 members of the National Socialist Party, saying that if the Rhineland issue cannot be resolved fairly, Germany will go its own way. If other countries have not yet abandoned the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles, which has been spurned by Germany, Germany would rather be isolated. The current problem cannot be solved by amending the treaty. We should correct our thinking and no longer discriminate against Germany. Regarding the attitude of European countries, Mr. Hee said, "What is regrettable now is that politicians in other countries always have two mistakes: 1. Germany is now under the control of a dictator, 2. Germany can be treated arbitrarily. I want to cooperate, but they have succeeded in creating a new way to insult Germany through this cooperation. If they have foresight, this plan will inevitably be poisonous in the future." (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke in the House of Commons today, reporting on the methods by which Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Belgium resolved the situation caused by Germany's entry into the Rhineland. All the seats were full, and there were no empty seats in the visitors' gallery.</p>
<p>Eden said that the German government has repeatedly stated its desire to ease the tense situation, but it remains to be seen what contribution it is willing to make. The British government's main purpose is to restore the world's trust in international law and create a situation in which we can work together to rebuild a solid Europe. However, trust has been destroyed and is not easy to restore. The Foreign Secretary then briefly described the temporary measures to ensure that negotiations proceed and achieve a satisfactory outcome, so as to re-establish a European security system. In addition to agreeing to send some troops to participate in the international force stationed in the narrow area east of the border between Germany and France and between Germany and Belgium, the British government also agreed to re-declare the obligations of the Locarno Pact with other countries to help restore trust. At the same time, it also asked Germany to make a contribution, but in the situation created by Germany's entry into the Rhineland, he is convinced that all members of the House will feel that it is extremely reasonable to ask Germany to make a contribution. Judging from the moderate attitude expressed by the French and Belgian governments, France and Belgium have already made a sufficient contribution, so it cannot be said that it is unreasonable to ask Germany to make a contribution.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then spoke about the proposed negotiations, saying that what is currently proposed is that the five signatory countries to the Locarno Pact must conduct negotiations based on the following:</p>
<p>1.  Several proposals in Germany's memorandum of March 7.</p>
<p>2.  The change in the current situation in the Rhineland.</p>
<p>3.  Drafting of a mutual assistance treaty that all signatory countries to the Locarno Pact can join.</p>
<p>The second stage will be a world conference initiated by the League of Nations to consider the proposals put forward by Germany regarding: 1. Security, 2. Arms Limitation, 3. Economic Relations between Countries. However, although all parties are extremely unwilling for the negotiations to fail, we must prevent the possibility of failure. He will publish a White Paper after his speech, which contains the drafts of letters from the British and Italian governments to the French and Belgian governments. The House of Commons will know what the position of Britain and Italy will be after the negotiations fail. As far as the British government is concerned, we are prepared to accept this proposal. We sincerely hope that the German government will also accept it. The German government has repeatedly stated that it is willing to ease the situation. Now is the time for the German government to show how it will contribute to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>The White Paper mentioned by British Foreign Secretary Eden contains the following guarantees that the British and Italian governments will give to France and Belgium in the event that efforts to resolve the situation fail:</p>
<p>1.  Consult on the new situation.</p>
<p>2.  Provide assistance in accordance with any measures jointly agreed upon in accordance with the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>3.  Adopt measures for mutual security to defend against unprovoked aggression.</p>
<p>4.  Establish or continue contacts between the general staff of various countries.</p>
<p>5.  Cooperate with the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations to seek the formulation of various beneficial proposals to maintain peace and respect international conventions. It is heard that the troops planned under the unarmed area police program by British responsible parties are just symbolic troops. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Declaration of French Foreign Minister The Foundation of Peace Has Been Consolidated France Advocates But Has Not Fully Achieved <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Paris: The Chamber of Deputies convened at 3:00 PM. Foreign Minister Flandin delivered a lengthy speech on the draft agreement established by the Locarno Conference. All members of the Chamber were silent and listened to the speech. The scene was extremely solemn. Flandin said, "In the past ten days or so, people have been panicked, all of them shaking their heads and frowning. Fortunately, the foundation of peace has been consolidated. What I contribute to you is this." The French government originally advocated that negotiations with Germany could only be held after the international system had fully returned to normal. However, during the London Conference, the French proposal was also not met with setbacks. The draft agreement stipulates that negotiations can only begin after all the conditions in it have been fully accepted by Germany, so as to formulate a new system for the Rhineland region and consider the peace plan put forward by German Führer Hitler. Flandin then pointed out that Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy have all agreed to reaffirm the obligations contained in the Locarno Treaty and that the general staff of Britain, France, and Belgium will conclude a military agreement to discuss mutual guarantee methods to supplement it. "Even if a general mutual assistance treaty is established to replace the Locarno Treaty, the above-mentioned mutual guarantee methods should still be included in the new treaty. This is clearly stipulated in the draft agreement of the Locarno Conference. The British government has now decided to faithfully abide by the obligations of the Locarno Treaty. Once a crisis occurs, it will fulfill its obligations unyieldingly to ensure France's security. As for the practical methods of guarantee, Britain has also agreed to discuss them with France at any time. I have obtained written guarantees from British Foreign Secretary Eden, the importance of which is understood by anyone in France. As far as France is concerned, Britain's participation in the ancestral guarantee method is an important stage in the relationship between Britain and France after the European War. Since the views and actions of the two countries are unified, their effectiveness in eliminating war is more significant than in 1914." Flandin then described the invitation to Germany to participate in the negotiations, saying that the results obtained by the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact at the London Conference are only the first stage. If Germany accepts the negotiations, there will be new hope for the future of European peace. The agreement drafted by the Locarno Conference is a whole. If Germany refuses to accept it, the governments of Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy will jointly implement the necessary measures. However, the expressions made by Germany are serious in nature and do not comply with the regulations. On the contrary, the demands we have made are mild in nature and their purpose is to test whether Führer Hitler is truly sincere. If the German government can understand this and accept our demands, so that our test can be successful, then we will look forward to it. Foreign Minister Flandin then pointed out that the collective security system must be extended to Central and Eastern Europe, and that if a strong peace is to be organized, both limiting armaments and easing economic tensions are essential. "We must now take the London Agreement as a starting point and work hard to build. This is incumbent on France, and it will definitely seek success with all sincerity. I sincerely hope that in the next few months, the dawn of peace will appear on the European sky and create a new era. However, we must still strive to become stronger, because at this moment there are still various possibilities, the nature of which is rather dim, so that European peace is still threatened. No matter what value the friendship we have concluded with other countries has, the urgent task at present is to rely on our own strength," he said. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

The meeting was chaired by Danish representative Mensch, and was attended by representatives from Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

<p>London: Regarding the issue of Germany's violation of the Locarno Treaty, representatives of countries in Europe that are not involved recently held a meeting from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM this morning. According to our reporter, the representatives of these countries did not express their support for the Locarno Four-Power Agreement, because once the agreement is accepted by the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations, the governments of these countries must implement it. If this is the case, the responsibility will be heavy and the danger will be great. The chairman of the meeting, Danish representative Mensch, visited British Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon and notified Eden of this opinion. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: The signatory countries to the Locarno Pact recently established a draft agreement in London. The second part of the agreement advocates convening an international conference to discuss international trade issues. The conference is said to be convened in Geneva or Brussels in Belgium in May of this year. Although the US government has not received a formal report, Deputy Secretary of State Phillips recently declared that convening an international economic conference to discuss international financial and economic issues, including the redistribution of raw materials, has always been supported by the United States. Once more detailed information is received, it will be commented on. (Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>League of Nations to Meet Tomorrow</p>
<p>London: Responsible personnel here recently declared that if the German government clearly refuses to consider the agreement established by the Locarno Conference, other countries will immediately implement it. Fortunately, the German government will not clearly refuse, but will put forward a counter-proposal, which other countries will also discuss. Even if Germany refuses to submit the mutual assistance treaty between France and Russia to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague for adjudication, other countries will not use this as an excuse to suspend negotiations, because the current negotiations have entered the third stage (the first stage is the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations condemning Germany's violation of the treaty, the second stage is the follow-up measures to the violation of the treaty, and the third stage is the negotiations on the overall situation in Europe). Its goal is to consider the mutual assistance treaty in Eastern Europe, the sky treaty in Western Europe, and the non-aggression pact in Central Europe in accordance with the London Declaration issued by the Central French government on February 3 last year, and to convene an international conference within two months to study the new Locarno Treaty and other issues, including the issue of arms limitation. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>London: British newspapers have expressed a hope that if Germany cannot accept the proposals for a new Locarno Treaty put forward by the four countries, it should at least put forward an answer and not completely refuse. If it is felt that Germany's opposition to the unilateral demilitarized zone is an obstacle to international reconciliation, the French government may cooperate to find other solutions. It seems that it may be possible to establish another bilateral zone and have the Allied forces of Britain and Italy stationed within the French border on the French-German border. The four countries asked Germany to submit its case against the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty to the Hague Court, which is not an indispensable condition for the negotiation of the Rhineland issue. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>London: When the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations held a closed meeting yesterday afternoon, it distributed the draft agreement of the Locarno Conference to the representatives of the member states for review. After the meeting adjourned, the representatives declared that the Executive Yuan had postponed the meeting until next Monday to hold another public meeting, so that the representatives of the various countries could ask their governments for instructions during this period. The representatives of a certain country also said that the decision-making meeting of the Executive Yuan may be moved to Geneva. Other representatives said that if the Executive Yuan holds a meeting in Geneva, Germany will definitely refuse to participate, and London is still the best place for the meeting. According to our reporter, the agenda of the public meeting of the Executive Yuan next Monday will be nothing more than the following: 1. Discuss the draft agreement of the Locarno Conference, 2. A decision should be made on the issue of submitting the mutual assistance treaty between France and Russia to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. 3. The measures to be taken by the Executive Yuan in accordance with the second part of the draft agreement should be studied by a committee. 4. The other measures contained in the draft agreement that are only related to the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact will be filed. However, the above agenda is not immutable, because Germany should submit a reply to the draft agreement before next Monday, or it may overturn this agenda. Informed sources believe that Germany will demand revisions to several points in the draft agreement. For example, objections will be raised to seeking direct access to the Permanent Court of The Hague and establishing a temporary demilitarized zone on the east bank of the Rhine, the second of which, in Germany's view, is discriminatory and unacceptable to the country.

<p>London - After four months of meetings, the naval conference has reached an agreement on a three-nation naval treaty to replace the expiring Washington Naval Treaty. The treaty will be signed at a plenary session at St. James's Palace on the 25th. The current participants are Britain, America, and France. Italy and Japan will be allowed to join at a later date. The treaty contains safeguard clauses that allow it to become invalid under certain circumstances. The safeguard clauses provide for the replacement of lost ships and the suspension of the treaty's effect during wartime, but it will remain in effect once hostilities cease. This decision was made at the final meeting, which lasted all night and ended at 1 p.m. today, with only a few hours of rest this morning. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The General Committee of the Naval Conference held a meeting this morning to review the draft naval treaty. Afterward, a statement was released stating, "The naval treaty is scheduled to be signed at 4 p.m. on March 26th in the Queen Anne Room of St. James's Palace. Representatives from the United States, France, Great Britain, and its self-governing dominions will sign the treaty at that time. Among the self-governing dominions of Great Britain, only the representative of the Irish Free State has expressed unwillingness to sign, citing respect for the freedom of the nation." At today's meeting, the General Committee reviewed and approved the following: The Italian delegation's general reservations regarding the tonnage of capital ships and the "non-construction zone" (meaning no ships may be built between the maximum tonnage of cruisers and the minimum tonnage of capital ships); The draft naval treaty, the original text, and the appended protocols. The representative of the Union of South Africa, a self-governing dominion of Great Britain, raised two reservations regarding the form adopted by the treaty and various conference documents. It was requested that these reservations be communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, after signing, so that he could forward them to the governments of all member states of the League of Nations for consideration. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The Anglo-French-American naval agreement will be released next Monday, and its contents are divided into three parts:</p>
<p>The first part stipulates that signatory countries should exchange shipbuilding programs and notify each other of all information before making any decisions to start shipbuilding. There are two methods: Signatory countries should notify each other of their annual shipbuilding programs within the first four months of each year. Each decision to build a ship should include notification to the other signatory countries of the new warship's tonnage, speed, caliber of guns, and number of personnel. In the case of aircraft carriers, the number of aircraft carried should also be included.</p>
<p>The second part stipulates various qualitative limitations and contains eight articles: The maximum tonnage of capital ships should be 35,000 tons, and the maximum caliber of guns should be 14 inches. However, this is conditional on the other two signatory countries of the Washington Naval Treaty (i.e., Japan and Italy) joining the agreement before January 1, 1937. Otherwise, the maximum caliber of guns will remain at 16 inches. The tonnage issue of capital ships should be renegotiated starting in 1940, with the hope of further reductions. The tonnage of Class B cruisers should be limited to 8,000 tons, and the caliber of guns should be limited to 6.1 inches (155mm). Signatory countries may retain their existing 10,000-ton cruisers, but may not build any more of these cruisers during the term of the naval treaty. Regarding the "non-construction zone," the construction of cruisers between 8,000 and 17,500 tons is prohibited. Guns below 10 inches are not allowed to be equipped on capital ships. The tonnage of submarines should be limited to 2,000 tons, and the caliber of guns should be limited to 4.7 inches (120mm). The tonnage of aircraft carriers should be limited to 23,000 tons, and the caliber of guns should be limited to 6.1 inches (155mm).</p>

<p>Paris - Foreign Minister Flandin made a lengthy speech in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, in which he addressed the issue of peace between Italy and Ethiopia. He stated, "I have taken the initiative to revive the peace front established last year by Britain, France, and Italy at the Stresa Conference. Now, Italy and Ethiopia are engaged in peace negotiations to realize this front. If the war between the two countries and the sanctions against Italy can be swiftly halted, then my joy will be boundless." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris - Following Foreign Minister Flandin's speech in the Chamber of Deputies today, in which he mentioned the issue of Italo-Ethiopian peace and implied that sanctions against Italy would be lifted, there was much discussion and varied opinions within the Chamber. However, officials from the Foreign Ministry stated that the Foreign Minister's remarks should be viewed as a French suggestion only. The Foreign Minister did not discuss the Italo-Ethiopian issue with the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, while in London. His mention of the matter in the Chamber today was purely his own idea and was not preceded by any consultation with the Italian government. Semi-official sources also stated that the Foreign Minister's intention was that expressions of compromise should be natural, rather than achieved through lengthy negotiations involving haggling over terms. Therefore, the Foreign Minister's speech was only intended to create a psychological environment and diplomatic atmosphere conducive to resolving the Italo-Ethiopian conflict. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London - Foreign Minister Flandin's speech in the Chamber of Deputies, in which he mentioned the issue of Italo-Ethiopian peace, has caused shock among members of the League of Nations Administrative Council. It is generally believed that Flandin's revelation of his intention to halt sanctions against Italy in his speech was a French gesture to repay Italy's sympathetic vote when the League of Nations Administrative Council recently voted on the Franco-Belgian draft resolution condemning Germany's violation of treaties, in which Italy also voted in favor. Furthermore, the situation regarding Italo-Ethiopian peace negotiations is likely more advanced than generally expected, as evidenced by this. The League of Nations Administrative Council consists of thirteen countries. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e39">Death of Soviet Physiologist Ivan Pavlov <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(TASS, Leningrad, February 27th) The great physiologist Ivan Pavlov passed away at 2:52 a.m. on February 27th, at the age of 86 and a half. Pavlov was born in 1849. At the age of 25, he published his first work, for which he received a gold medal from the University of St. Petersburg. Pavlov and his students' research has been recognized worldwide. In 1904, he received the Nobel Prize and 50 scientific honors from countries around the world. He was revered as the mentor of physiologists worldwide. All of Pavlov's scientific work was based on strict materialism. For the last 35 years, he devoted himself to the study of neurophysiology and pathology. He regarded the highest nervous activity and mental activity as one, and studied mental phenomena with materialism. He recently asserted, "An important stage in human thought is about to dawn. At that time, physiology and psychology, objective and subjective, will be unified. At that time, the contradictions and opposition between perception and the body will be resolved or naturally eliminated." Scientists from all over the world listened to Pavlov's speeches at previous international neurological and physiological conferences. They will never forget Pavlov's words and demeanor at the International Physiological Conference held in the Soviet Union last year. Pavlov's work expanded after the Russian Revolution because the Soviet government provided him with particularly favorable conditions for his scientific work, providing all necessary materials and money. Moreover, with the expansion of the Leningrad laboratory, a small town was built near Leningrad specifically for his scientific work. Until recently, his mind was still full of courage, hope, and optimistic plans. In September 1934, on his 85th birthday, this venerable scientist, admired by all, was praised by the Soviet government, various Soviet public organizations, and scientists from around the world. He still insisted that he did not believe he was old, and that he still wanted and was able to work. Six days ago, he formulated his work plan for 1936, still with this determination. Unfortunately, death robbed him of his precious life. Pavlov's school has produced many talented Soviet physiologists and published a large number of works in the Soviet Union. It will certainly continue to complete the great work of Pavlov's lifelong efforts.</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Importance and Promotion of Literacy Campaigns (Middle) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Section Chief of the Ministry of Education, Zhong Lingxiu</p>
<p>3. Several Methods to Improve the Promotion of Literacy Campaigns in the Future</p>
<p>There are 300 million illiterate people in our country who should receive literacy education. Of these, over 6.79 million people have already become literate through public schools, accounting for only 2.7% of the illiterate population. More than 97% of those who should receive literacy education have not yet received it. Therefore, we feel that literacy campaigns should be actively promoted. Moreover, from the 17th to the 23rd year of the Republic, a total of only over 6.7 million people became literate over seven years, an average of just over one million people receiving literacy education per year. If this method continues, it will take 100 years to eliminate illiteracy among the 300 million illiterate people. This is a serious and urgent problem. Therefore, the methods for promoting literacy campaigns in the future must be improved. However, this matter is important and deserves careful research and discussion. I hope that my compatriots, especially those in the education sector, will conduct more research and discussion in order to obtain the most effective, economical, and thorough solution for the government to use. I will now present a few personal opinions for everyone to discuss:</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, there are only two steps to popularizing literacy education: the first step is to hold literacy campaigns to widely publicize to illiterate people the pain of illiteracy and the importance of literacy; the second step is to open more literacy places, such as public schools and literacy schools, so that the general public has places and opportunities to become literate and read. However, in addition to public schools and literacy schools with fixed schedules and courses, more mobile literacy places should be established, such as literacy stations, question-asking stations, open-air schools, mobile teaching, lantern slide education, door-to-door teaching, or using methods such as the "little teacher" system and family students, with the determination to "welcome those who come and deliver to those who do not," so that illiterate people who have difficulties in life and lack time can get opportunities to become literate and read anytime and anywhere. In addition, compulsory education should also be actively promoted in parallel. Because the current young and adult illiterates are all left over from the lack of compulsory education in the past, so there are as many as 300 million illiterates in the country. If compulsory education in our country had been popularized earlier, as in European and American countries, there would definitely not be so many illiterates now. Therefore, popularizing compulsory education is a fundamental solution to eliminating illiteracy. Otherwise, the number of illiterates will continue to increase day by day, and literacy campaigns will never end. Fortunately, the current government is able to equally value the popularization of compulsory education and the popularization of public education, a fundamental solution that addresses the symptoms and causes.</p>
<p>To achieve the goal of universal literacy, it is necessary to implement compulsion, with the government making the greatest determination to strictly supervise and promote it within a limited time. The method can be to first compel illiterate people between the ages of 16 and 30 as the first phase. After the first phase is completed, people between the ages of 30 and 40 will be compelled as the second phase. After the second phase is completed, people between the ages of 40 and 50 will be compelled as the third phase. This phased approach will be more economical in terms of manpower and financial resources.</p>
<p>The promotion of literacy education should have a dedicated responsible agency to be strictly enforced, as well as perform investigations and assessments. This agency should work closely with local administrative agencies, autonomous agencies, and military and police agencies to discuss progress. The Ministry of Education will issue key points for the organization of public education committees in counties and cities, which can be used for reference in establishing public education committees to carry out and plan all aspects of literacy education in coordination.</p>
<p>Illiterate people have the obligation to receive literacy education, and literate people have the obligation to teach illiterate people to read. This obligation cannot be exempted under any circumstances. In recent years, various localities have organized labor service groups, and it is most appropriate for literate people to undertake this kind of labor, which can also save a lot of teacher expenses. I hope that literate compatriots will work hard to serve the country and society, and to seek happiness for the people. This is everyone's inescapable duty and a heavenly duty that everyone should be happy to undertake.</p>
<p>The criteria for illiteracy are defined as those who cannot write their own name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation, cannot read simple books and newspapers, and cannot write simple ordinary letters. They are the targets for the implementation of literacy education. We should conduct clear area surveys so that they can receive literacy education.</p>
<p>In addition to the three types of Sanmin Zhuyi Thousand Character Primers A, B, and C compiled by the Ministry of Education and the literacy textbooks published by the Educational Book Bureau, surveys should be conducted on the characters needed by people in various localities and occupations, and various vocabularies and literacy common sense textbooks should be edited as supplementary reading materials. The teaching materials should pay attention to the following aspects: (1) They must meet the needs of the people's lives. (2) They must meet the psychological needs of the people. (3) They must be close to the people's experiences. (4) They must be able to express the people's aesthetic sense. (5) They must be able to cultivate the people's personality. (6) They must be in line with civic education.</p>
<p>Educational administrative agencies should encourage various bookstores to edit more various simple reading materials and sell them at low prices so that literate people can read more and continue to become literate, review, and further their studies.</p>
<p>Those who are illiterate and teach others to read after becoming literate should be rewarded according to the number of people they have taught and their achievements.</p>
<p>For those who have graduated from public schools and are literate, regulations should be made for continuing to review and practice using the characters they have learned, such as writing letters, reading newspapers, keeping accounts, writing diaries, and reading public supplementary reading materials and simple stories and novels. The original teachers should provide guidance, or other designated personnel should be assigned to allow literate people to have opportunities and convenience for continuing to review and further their studies.</p>
<p>The most difficult problems in actively promoting literacy education are generally said to be the three items of school buildings, teachers, and funding. However, our China is a poor country and should come up with poor methods to bury ourselves in hard work in order to achieve the goal of eliminating illiteracy. For example, regarding the issue of school buildings, we do not need magnificent school buildings. We only need to borrow existing houses from various schools, groups, public agencies, ancestral halls, guild halls, temples, etc. for use as school buildings without having to raise funds to build school buildings. Regarding teachers, we have one-quarter of literate compatriots, 100 million people, and 300 million illiterate people. If a literate person can be responsible for teaching three illiterate people to read, this major problem of eliminating illiteracy can be solved.</p>

<p>Fertile Land Deemed Ideal Agricultural Immigration Area</p>
<p>7.26 Million Hectares of Cultivated Land in 27 Counties</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The northeastern three provinces and the South Manchuria area are relatively densely populated, so their land has long been developed. The North Manchuria area has fertile land that is no less than South Manchuria, but its population is not as prolific as South Manchuria. The Japanese deem it an ideal agricultural immigration area. Their initial plan is to conduct surveys and statistics. The Japanese first surveyed the 27 counties under the jurisdiction of the puppet Binjiang Province, the most fertile area in North Manchuria, and found that the cultivated area reached 7.26 million hectares. It is reported that the cultivated area in the previous year was only 1.15 million hectares. In the past, the landlords in various counties were squeezed by Japanese puppet corrupt officials and heavy taxes, and the land prices were very low, so they abandoned the land. In addition, there was a lot of uncultivated land due to water damage and unstable security. Currently, the Manchurian-Russian border is tense, and Japanese troops are gathered in North Manchuria. Developing agricultural areas has the intention of stationing troops, and security groups are organized to engage in defense. According to Japanese statistics, the cultivated area this year has greatly increased. The following is a list of arable land and cultivated land in 27 counties of the puppet Binjiang Province (unit: hectare):</p>
<h3 id="e92">De Wang's Representative Bao Yueqing Returns to Beiping from Bailingmiao <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>De Wang Sends Ao Yuzhang to Visit Fu Zuoyi</p>
<p>Bao Talks About De Wang's Support for the Central Government, Without Carrying Disloyalty Beiping Correspondence: Bao Yueqing, representative of the Mongolian Political Council of Bailingmiao stationed in Beiping, left Beiping for Pangjiang before the Mongolian rumors were rampant to visit Demchugdongrub, Vice Chairman of the Council, for consultation. Since then, he has traveled between the Miao and the River, and the news of his return to Beiping has been silent. During this period, the six counties of Chahar North were occupied by the puppet army of Li Shouxin, who advanced from Duolun and advocated a false title, causing the attitude of De Wang to be more widely rumored, and it was said that he had joined the puppet army in Chahar North. As a result of the rumors, the general public had unlimited disappointment in the Mongolian Political Council of Bailingmiao.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Mongolian Political Council in Suiyuan, De Wang's attitude has been even more noteworthy. Yun Jixian, Director of the Security Office of the Mongolian Political Council of Bailingmiao, led his troops to withdraw. When the telegram came, all parties suspected that the Council had announced its dissolution. Until recently, De Wang seemed to have made a factual clarification due to the fear of people's words. First, he sent a representative, Ao Yuzhang, from Bailingmiao to Sui to visit Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan. Then, he ordered his representative in Beiping, Bao Yueqing, to go from Pangjiang through Chahar North to Zhangjiakou to visit Zhang Zizhong, Chairman of Chahar, and made the same statement. Bao then arrived in Beiping at 7:00 AM this (20th) morning.</p>
<p>After Bao arrived in Beiping, visitors came in an endless stream, including two Japanese, whose names are unknown. It is said that they were paying a visit. Bao visited Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, at Wuyiku at 10:00 AM that morning and made a sincere statement on behalf of De Wang. They talked for an hour before he left. According to side news about the content of the Song-Bao conversation, Song was extremely concerned about the severe snow disaster in Mongolia and promised to find ways to solicit donations for emergency relief. Bao made a thorough analysis of De Wang's attitude and believed that the various rumors outside were not credible. He asked Song to report to the Central Government on his behalf. Song expressed his admiration for De Wang's loyalty and patriotism. Therefore, the result of the conversation was extremely satisfactory. The reporter went to Bao's residence for an interview at noon. Bao answered each of the questions: "The Mongolian Political Council of Suiyuan was established when Mongolian rumors were rampant. Although it caused a lot of suspicion among the general public, in fact, the Council is one of the subordinate agencies of the Bailingmiao Mongolian Council, which is not surprising. In the near future, the Alxa Banner will also have the same agency. This is purely for the convenience of handling autonomy, and it is by no means Mongolian separation. Therefore, De Wang's attitude can be summed up in one sentence: "Supporting the Central Government, without carrying disloyalty." The opposition between the Miao and Sui Councils has been self-evident. Until now, the Suiyuan Mongolian Council has sent a special commissioner to be stationed in the Temple River on a regular basis, and the Temple River Mongolian Council has also set up an office in Suiyuan, responsible by Ao Yunzhang." Bao continued, "Since De Wang's attitude is clear, the external rumors have been self-defeating. As far as he knows, the puppet army government in Chahar North, instigated by Zhuo Shihuai and Li Shouxin, has not been established. Zhuo Shihuai is now in the cattle and sheep flocks, and Li is staying in Zhangbei County. The number of people in the two departments has not increased. The recent situation in the six counties is also peaceful. It is completely unfounded to say that Li's troops were stationed in Bailingmiao. Because the training group under De Wang's jurisdiction recently changed into yellow clothing, this caused this misunderstanding. As for Yun Jixian, the Director of the Security Office of the Temple River Mongolian Council, who defected, he is now stationed in Saxian. De Wang decided to order the guns and ammunition carried away by his troops to be returned to the Temple River Mongolian Council. Ao Yuzhang is now contacting Chairman Fu in Suiyuan to hand over the guns and ammunition. It will be resolved satisfactorily soon. Wu Heling, a member of the Mongolian Tibetan Council, also felt that the journey was dangerous because Ni Guanzhou was killed in Zhangbei, so he stayed in Pangjiang to assist De Wang in handling foreign affairs. The rumors that he was also killed are not true. Wu has already scheduled to come to Beiping within a month and transfer back to Nanjing." Finally, the reporter asked Bao about the tragic snow disaster in Mongolia. He said, "In previous years, Mongolian winter snowfalls were around 100 days. Unexpectedly, after the snowfall started in October last year, it has not cleared up until now. The snow on the plains is between four and five feet deep, and the low-lying areas are even deeper. Because the grass source has been cut off, cattle and sheep first eat each other's hair, and then they wither and starve to death. The number is 99 percent. Wealthy households with 3,000 heads of cattle and sheep have become impoverished. At the same time, a fuel panic has occurred. Since there is no more livestock dung, the Mongolian yurts are dismantled for fuel. The tragic situation is no less than a river flood. Therefore, De Wang first established a fundraising association in Pangjiang and ordered his subordinates to report the details of the losses in order to raise funds for relief as a whole. In the near future, De Wang will send a special commissioner to Beijing to appeal for relief. I am entering Beijing to wait for the telegram order, but it is believable that I will not go elsewhere in the short term in order to contact the local authorities here at any time."</p>
<p>According to Mongolian sources, the Japanese Kwantung Army now has a special agency in Bailingmiao. The head of the agency is named Quanhai, who travels back and forth between Bailingmiao and Pangjiang. Japanese aircraft are also constantly found in Pangjiang. As for the number of puppet troops in Chahar North, Li and Zhuo have a total of more than 3,000 people. Their number is called the Chahar East Army. The people in the six counties are groaning and complaining because they cannot bear the supply and disturbance. If this continues, it is feared that it will trigger a civil unrest. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Hebei Authorities to Conduct a Thorough Elimination of Communist Bandits in Southern Hebei <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Four Counties Including Yaoshan Designated as an Administrative Region</p>
<p>At the Same Time, Suppression of the Poor People's Society in Western Hebei</p>
<p>Baoding Dispatch: Since the Communist bandits disturbed Shanxi, Hebei Chairman Song Zheyuan, considering the close proximity and relations between Hebei and Shanxi provinces, and the extreme importance of border defense, has not only deployed strong defenses in key fortresses, but also sent Security Director Zhang Yunrong to various counties in western and southern Hebei to supervise the stationed troops and local militias, strictly preventing banditry. However, in the Yaoshan, Julu, and Renxian areas of southern Hebei, Communist bandits still lie hidden. In the Pingshan, Lingshou, and Jingxing areas of western Hebei, there is an illegal organization called the Poor People's Society. After deliberation on countermeasures, it was decided to use political power to promote their awakening and self-renewal. Furthermore, Yaoshan, Renxian, Julu, and Neiqiu counties will be unified into one district, with a special administrative commissioner appointed to be responsible for all bandit suppression and pacification matters within the territory. Su Shen Zhang Jinchen was appointed as the magistrate of Yaoshan County and concurrently the administrative commissioner of the Yaoshan District. Zhang was one of the pioneers in this province to advocate the establishment of a defense corps to promote people's self-defense, and he formerly served as the president of Hebei University, having a good understanding of politics. After the establishment of the Tanggu Truce, Zhang was ordered to enter the war zone to manage a certain county, achieving considerable success. Afterwards, he used his personal savings to establish a defense corps, personally going to various counties for leadership. This time, the provincial government entrusted him with full responsibility for the four counties. He undoubtedly has policies to resolve the Communist bandits within the territory. Furthermore, the provincial government holds the utmost determination to thoroughly eliminate the Communist bandits lurking in the localities. Therefore, the militias of the four counties in the Yaoshan District are completely placed under Zhang's command. Song Zheyuan also ordered Liu Zhensan's troops to be stationed within the territory of the district to assist Zhang in eliminating the Communist bandits. Therefore, the banditry in southern Hebei can gradually be resolved and eliminated.</p>
<p>The Pingshan, Lingshou, and Jingxing areas of western Hebei are located in a border region, situated at the foot of the Taihang Mountains. The territory is crisscrossed by mountains, and transportation is extremely inconvenient, resulting in it becoming a haven for petty criminals. Furthermore, due to the economic bankruptcy of the rural areas in recent years and the difficulties in the lives of the farmers, the farmers with weak wills are extremely susceptible to the instigation of villains. Since the summer, illegal organizations of the Poor People's Society have emerged in various places. The leaders of the society are mostly intellectuals, raising the deceptive banner of "distributing grain" and "equalizing wealth," propagating everywhere, and inciting the masses. They also used gangsters from the city to act recklessly. By winter, their power had grown stronger, and the number of people joining had gradually increased, many of whom were local ruffians and vagrants lacking clothing and food. They often summoned gatherings to rob villages, and they posted slogans with absurd language everywhere in densely populated areas such as market towns and temple fairs. As a result, people's hearts were unsettled. Although the local authorities repeatedly wanted to suppress them, they ultimately felt powerless due to the long distances and inconvenient transportation. Moreover, many of the bandits were villagers without obvious markings, and the leaders among them were even more secretive and difficult to find. The common people also harbored suspicions of each other, and even if they suffered minor losses, they did not dare to report to the authorities for fear of causing greater trouble. This caused the banditry to become increasingly rampant, and the local wealthy households were repeatedly robbed. The bandits killed and set fires without any scruples. In Mupan Village in Pingshan County, bandits were entrenched, numbering as many as seven or eight hundred people. The local militia police were ordered to search and suppress them many times, but it was difficult to completely eliminate them. At this moment, the Security Bureau is supervising Pingshan County and neighboring counties to jointly defend and suppress them. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Agricultural Guidance Committees Established in Various Counties of Guangdong Province <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>—Afforestation to be Expanded This Year—</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In recent years, the counties of Guangdong Province have spared no effort in promoting agricultural and forestry undertakings. Special attention has been paid to afforestation, which has been included in the three-year administrative plan and circulated for strict implementation. Many of the barren hills in various places have been developed into forest farms in a timely manner, guiding the people to promote afforestation in order to increase farmers' production and develop the rural economy. Plans for expanding the promotion of afforestation and holding afforestation movement publicity weeks have been developed and implemented by various counties. The Agricultural and Forestry Extension Office has widely purchased tree seedlings and distributed them to farmers for planting, so that the barren land in various counties can be established as forestry areas to implement afforestation plans. The model forest farm in the Eastern District has also increased the purchase of tree seedlings for the purpose of implementing an expanded afforestation movement, and has issued notices to various county districts and villages for planting. This method is undoubtedly beneficial to the promotion of the afforestation plan. Furthermore, counties that have not yet established forest farms are now planning to complete them within this year, and have also decided to establish rice seed propagation farms and district and township nurseries, vigorously expanding forestry and improving agricultural products, so that farmers' lives can be effectively assisted. In addition, regarding the research and improvement of agricultural methods, it is planned that each county will establish a guidance committee, assigning personnel with rich agricultural knowledge and experience to engage in guiding rural improvement, paying attention to the development of crops in order to universalize and improve them.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Travel Notes from Hunan and Guangdong (10) (Travel Correspondence from Our Newspaper Reporter) Feelings After Returning <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway has been connected, and the date is already imminent. This is something that all Chinese people unanimously believe is joyful. However, according to my observations, the entire line being connected is something to be celebrated, but it seems that there are still difficulties in the full operation of the entire line. This is something that the authorities must pay close attention to. First, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is currently divided into three sections. The sleepers of the Hunan-Hubei section are rotten, and the train moves as bumpily as a cradle, as I have mentioned before. The southern section is in better condition, but the vehicles are extremely old and unclean. Only the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section, being a newly built line, is in excellent condition. It is like a body where the head and feet are sick, but the abdomen is healthy. What good is a healthy abdomen if the head and feet are sick? Therefore, the most important task in the future is to find ways to treat the head and feet, striving to make them as healthy as the abdomen, so that the whole body can develop evenly. I have heard that the Ministry of Railways has established a reorganization committee, which is intended to seek the soundness of the entire Guangdong-Hankou line. I wonder if there are concrete plans in terms of funding? Second, the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section ordered a large number of 4-8-4 type giant locomotives from the United Kingdom, capable of traveling 40 kilometers per hour, but only a few have been delivered, and they will not all arrive until November of this year. These giant locomotives do not seem to be able to handle the railway tracks of the Hunan-Hubei section and the southern section. Before the head and feet are healthy, if these locomotives are used to travel the entire line, it will inevitably lead to head injuries and broken feet, which would be unwise. In my opinion, before the Hunan-Hubei section and the southern section have been completely reorganized, train operations should still be divided into three sections: from Wuchang Xujiapeng to Changsha, from Changsha to Lechang, and from Lechang to Guangzhou. In this way, there will be no bias towards the heavy and the light. If the train schedule is properly arranged, there will be no inconvenience for passengers. Third, the reason why the road administration of the Hunan-Hubei section and the southern section are not maintained is that the income is exhausted and there is no money for cultivation. However, since it is not possible to increase revenue, there is only one way to reduce expenditure. When the Ministry of Railways decides to reorganize the road affairs of the two sections, it should study how to improve the business of the two sections. How can revenue be increased, or how can expenditure be reduced? A fundamental solution should be obtained. Otherwise, even if huge sums of money are allocated for large-scale reorganization, it can only be gratifying for a while, and it is not possible to expect it to last for a long time.</p>
<p>The above is a humble opinion on the overall reorganization of the entire line. There are also other aspects, such as promoting scenic spots and promoting freight transport, which I will also present, even if I am ignorant: First, promoting scenic spots. The Guangdong-Hankou Railway passes through the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, with a total length of 1,096 kilometers. The cities along the line, such as Guangzhou, Shaozhou, Hengyang, Changsha, Yuezhou, and Wuchang, are all large cities, and their famous scenic spots and historical sites are well known to the world and do not need to be repeated. The smaller cities, with their waterfront villages shrouded in mist, green waters, and verdant mountains, are also extremely expansive and magnificent, but unfortunately, their fame has not been established and cannot be revealed. To list what I know: In Guangdong Province, there are the Fulu Shou Mountains in Lechang, the Taihe Cave in Yinzhanjun, and the Feilai Temple, Cangxia Cave, and Feixia Cave in Pajiangkou. The Blind Man's Gorge, Yangying Gorge, Stone General Temple, and Cao Zhu Niangniang Temple in Lianjiangkou. The Lengcang Rock, Zhupo Rock, Li Fan Stele, and Nanshan Temple in Yingde. The Cuihua Pavilion, Shunfeng Temple, Furong Mountain, Nanhua Temple, and Jiucheng Terrace in Shaozhou. The Han Wengong Temple, Xishi Rock, Meishan Waterfall, and Jiulong Shibatan in Lechang. The Jinji Ridge in Pingshi. In Hunan Province, there are the Mengyan and Genyan in Yizhang. The Su Xian Ridge, Yidi Tomb, Chayu Pavilion, and hot spring baths in Chenzhou. The Fengchu Pavilion, Cai Zi Pond, Du Fu Tomb, and Ma Fu Ridge in Leiyang. The Three Gian Daifu Tomb in Miluo, etc. All of the above have considerable historical value and are worthy of sightseeing. In my opinion, it seems appropriate to work with local people to find ways to promote the scenic spots and historical sites along the railway line: repair and organize them properly. For those that are farther away, roads can also be built to make them more convenient. Attracting tourists is the way to benefit the local area, and it is also the way to increase railway revenue. Second, promoting freight transport. The products along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, such as Guangdong's industrial textiles, salt and seafood, aquatic vegetables, coal, tobacco, tea, wood, etc., Hunan's Hunan embroidery, soybeans, ramie, pigs, rice, umbrellas, tung oil, etc., and Hubei's tea bricks, charcoal, rice, etc., are too numerous to mention, and Hunan's products are the most abundant. Regarding railway freight, since the Ministry of Railways implemented responsible transport, it has strived for commercialization, eliminating the previous malpractices, and the business of each line has been revitalized. However, what I mean by promoting freight transport is how to help merchants develop their business and promote freight transport. The products of Hunan and Guangdong are so abundant, but the old-fashioned merchants may not be able to pay much attention to the supply and demand of goods and the method of packaging. The railway should show them the financial situation in various places, the level of living, the purchasing power of society, and general preferences. At the same time, in terms of packaging, it should also plan with the simplest, strongest, most economical, and most convenient methods. In this way, the railway and the merchants become one, depending on each other like lips and teeth. When the business of the merchants is developed, the promotion of railway freight will also achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>In addition, everything I witnessed in the places I passed through, whether general social matters or aspects of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, was very vigorous, with no signs of inertia, which is truly gratifying. However, on the way back, I visited Macau, where everything I saw was evil. Smoking and gambling are everywhere. Since the governing authorities levy taxes on this, there is no value in criticism. However, from Macau to Zhongshan, the Qiguan Highway is as smooth as an arrow, with clear streams and ancient trees, and the scenery is beautiful, which makes travelers appreciate it. (The End)</p>

<p>Japanese Officers Arrive in Suzhou One After Another</p>
<p>Twenty Japanese officers arrived in Suzhou yesterday morning from Shanghai in four special cars along the Shanghai-Suzhou Highway. The county government, upon receiving a notification from the Shanghai Municipal Government and the provincial government, immediately instructed the Public Security Bureau to provide protection. The acting director, Yan Jishi, immediately dispatched the Flying Team Inspector Qiang Zhang Jiahu to lead the police in cars to Kunshan to welcome them. They then accompanied the officers on a week-long inspection of the Suzhou-Jiashan Highway at places such as Shidai Bridge outside the city. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, they left Suzhou and went in the direction of the Suzhou-Changzhou Highway. Inspector Qiang and others followed in cars for protection. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau received another report that another eighteen Japanese officers had arrived in Suzhou.</p>
<p>The Stonecutter Strike Resolved</p>
<p>More than four hundred quarry workers at Jiaoshan Quarry, Shimatou, Mudu Township, went on strike to demand a wage increase from the mine owners, but failed. It is now known that after the Mudu Township Chief Wang Shujie worked hard to mediate between the representatives of both labor and management, the wages were increased by one-fourth, which satisfied both parties. All the workers resumed work as usual yesterday (21st). Chief Wang came to Suzhou on the 21st to pay respects to County Magistrate Deng and report on the course of the strike.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar, Crackdown on Hoarding</p>
<p>The price of rice in Suzhou has been rising continuously for ten days. Although it has recently fallen slightly, there are still signs of continued rises. In total, it has risen by 1.2 yuan within ten days, and the general public is crying out in agony. According to a report from the General Labor Union to the County Party Department, this soaring rice price must be due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and speculating, monopolizing the market price. They requested strict crackdowns and efforts to suppress rice prices. Special Commissioner Sun specially ordered the County Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting of rice industry representatives for reply. The County Chamber of Commerce replied to the County Party Department yesterday (21st), saying that due to various reasons, the inventory of rice shops in Suzhou is limited. If they are not purchased in the spring, there will inevitably be panic when the harvest is not yet available in late spring or early summer. This is not hoarding and speculation. As for the rice price issue, it should be requested that the County Party Department work with the County Government to find a solution.</p>
<p>Wuxi Strictly Prohibits Unscrupulous Merchants from Manipulating Copper Coins</p>
<p>The Tongye Gonghui (guild) of twenty-one industries in Mu County, including the wine, soy sauce, and tobacco industries, recently reported that the exchange rate of copper coins in Wuxi is unstable. They specially requested the provincial and county authorities to find a way to stop it "and requested that it be handled in accordance with the methods stipulated by the ministry." County Magistrate Long, after receiving the report, stated that the exchange rate of legal tender in this county was determined by the former county magistrate in November of last year after inviting industry and commerce groups for discussion. It was temporarily standardized at 300 copper coins worth ten each per yuan, with the highest not exceeding 310 coins and the lowest not less than 290 coins. Recently, the exchange rate of legal tender on the market has risen to more than 310 coins per yuan, which is obviously being manipulated by someone for other purposes. This is indeed inappropriate. Yesterday, a public notice was issued strictly prohibiting unauthorized changes to the exchange rate of legal tender and arbitrary rises and falls thereafter. Anyone who dares to deliberately violate the prohibition will be severely punished without any leniency.</p>

<p>Changshu The Embezzlement of Education Funds Case Concluded</p>
<p>The case of Hua Zhaozeng, the former accountant of the Education Bureau, embezzling funds amounting to more than 75,000 yuan a few years ago, caused a sensation at the time, and is now completely closed with 952 yuan returned. The case originated in 1933, when the accounting office of the Education Bureau discovered that Hua Zhaozeng, the accountant of the rent collection office, had embezzled funds. After detailed investigation, the amount was shockingly high, reaching more than 75,000 yuan. Hua was sent to the county for investigation and handling. At that time, the education sector was extremely shocked. Hua voluntarily offered to compensate for the embezzlement and was released on bail by ten money shops. Hua disappeared without a trace like a yellow crane. The county government sentenced the guarantor Gao Zilin to one year in prison, but the embezzled funds could not be recovered. It was later discovered that Hua was a native of Wuxi and had some land in Wuxi. The county sent a letter to the Wuxi County government requesting that his land be auctioned off. It was not until the beginning of this month that someone agreed to buy the property for 952 yuan. The Education Bureau of this county went to Wuxi to collect the money, and thus this major embezzlement case of education funds was concluded with a compensation of one-thousandth and five percent.</p>
<p>Fire in the Park</p>
<p>All the houses in the North Gate Park have been built by individuals and teahouses have been opened. Among them, there is the Huan Cui Xia Zhu, which is the most magnificent place in the entire park. Its tea customers are mostly local so-called gentry, retired administrative personnel, and current government employees who lead affluent and leisurely lives. Therefore, although it is nominally called a teahouse, it is actually a club for people who hold county political power, and outsiders rarely set foot in it. As a result, society calls it the Huan Cui faction. The designated regular tea customers of this place rarely miss the morning and evening sessions. Unexpectedly, at about 9:30 PM on the 19th, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen behind the Huan Cui Xia Zhu, and the flames instantly burst through the roof. Fortunately, the teahouse staff quickly reported to the Fire Brigade and went to extinguish the fire. The teahouse in front was not affected, and only the doors and windows were destroyed. Alas, the Huan Cui faction is about to lose its residence.</p>

Only the elderly and children were left to guard the homes. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in a certain house, and the red flames soared into the sky. The wind was strong, and when the farmers learned of the fire and rushed back to rescue it, all 14 tile houses in the village had been burned down. Shen Meilai's mother, 76 years old, Shen Fuxing's mother, Mrs. Zhang, 68 years old, and Shen Yinkui's daughter, 13 years old, and Shen Heshang's son, 9 years old, and Shen Deguan's son, not older than 7 years, were burned to death.

<p>Hangzhou The Yuyao Salt Dispute Resurfaces</p>
<p>The Yuyao salt dispute was mediated by the Shaoxing Administrative Inspector's Office, and three resolutions were agreed upon: salt merchants would advance 65,000 yuan, and the collection of salt would be resumed at 40% starting from the 20th. The dispute could have been resolved, but in order to break the bad habits of Pengchang's handling of exploitation of salt farmers, the Salt Transport Department sent a weighman from the salt field to the warehouse to carry out the weighing. More than 100 people in Yuyao field, seeing that their own interests were being harmed, incited carters to strike, causing salt to be unable to be transported to the warehouse, and the collection of salt was suspended again. The field director and the storage merchants have separately telegraphed the Liangjiang Salt Transport Department for instructions, and tax police will be sent to forcefully stop it, and Pengchang, the leader, will be arrested. The dispute can then be resolved, and the livelihood of the salt farmers can be maintained.</p>
<p>Huili Bank Suspends Business for Liquidation</p>
<p>Hangzhou Huili Bank, which opened in Qinghefang Lane Xinyu Lane, has been around for more than ten years. The manager was the late Wang Zhuqi, a well-known figure in the Hangzhou business community. After Wang's death, the deputy manager Shu Shen'an was promoted to manager. However, the bank's capital was less than 150,000 yuan, and the scope of business could not be greatly expanded. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, the bank had a large number of bad debts from shops, making it difficult to meet depositors' withdrawals. A temporary shareholders meeting was held on the afternoon of the 19th. Due to the difficulty of increasing shares, it was decided to suspend business and entrust lawyer Chen Huimin to liquidate. The bank's debts and receivables can be offset against each other, and there is no impact on the financial market.</p>
<p>Port A Counterfeit Coin Trafficking Ring Busted</p>
<p>Kuang Liandeng, a local resident living in Yuqing Lane in District 1, made a living by secretly trafficking in counterfeit subsidiary coins. Each time, his wife, Kuang Zhang, and a woman named Zheng Wen, specialized in trafficking from Shanghai to Bengbu, and no one recognized them. The counterfeit subsidiary coins they transported were mostly two-corner banknotes. Every 100 yuan of counterfeit banknotes could be sold for 45 yuan of legal tender. Their secret sales agency was set up in Kuang's home. Recently, a Lu man named Wang Cunde went to traffic them and was noticed by the gang police in District 1, who reported it to the bureau for arrest. Sixty-nine counterfeit two-corner banknotes were found on the two women, Kuang and Zheng, who were arrested along with Wang Cunde and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.

<p>Expenses Will Be Subsidized by the Ministry</p>
<p>Approved by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>According to the Times News Agency, although the method of exchanging legal tender has been extended to May 3rd, there is still a large number of silver coins hidden among the people in our vast country's remote provinces that have not been exchanged for legal tender. Now, in order to facilitate the people's exchange and to avoid the people being misunderstood and detained by the military and police for carrying cash on their own to exchange for legal tender, the Central Bank has specially consulted and approved the Ministry of Finance to order all its branches throughout the country to send personnel carrying legal tender to villages and places where there are no agencies for exchanging legal tender to exchange silver coins for legal tender among the people. As for the expenses required by the Central Bank for handling this exchange procedure, the Ministry of Finance has also agreed to subsidize, but at most it cannot exceed 3% of the total amount of silver received. According to the Nanjing branch's report, it is planned to entrust reputable banks or commercial firms in provinces, cities, and counties to collect cash and give a handling fee of no more than 3%. After learning about the situation, the bank has sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance asking for permission to do so, and other branches that make the same request can also be handled in the same way. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance, after learning about the situation, will approve it in order to collect cash.</p>

The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>History of Martyrdom The late Deng Zhongyuan, whose name was Keng, was from Huiyang, Guangdong. He followed Premier Sun Yat-sen to advocate revolution and was extremely loyal. Two years before the establishment of the Republic, during the Guangzhou New Army Uprising, he planned and launched the uprising with Zhao Boxian and others. On August 19th, one year before the establishment of the Republic, during the Wuchang Uprising, Mr. Deng Keng infiltrated Danshui and led the people's militia to launch an attack. Hu Hanmin served as the governor and Mr. Deng Keng served as the director of the Army Department and later as the garrison commander of Qiongyai. In the sixth year of the Republic, the military government was organized and he served as the chief of staff. When Premier Sun Yat-sen led the Northern Expedition, he relied on Deng's preparation of military pay and equipment. On March 20th of the eleventh year of the Republic, he went to Hong Kong due to an incident. He returned to the Guangdong capital the next day and was suddenly attacked by assassins just after leaving the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station, suffering two gunshot wounds. He died at 5 AM on the 23rd, at the age of only 38. Because the Central Government believed that Deng's achievements were great, the Standing Committee decided to designate that day as Deng's martyrdom anniversary.</p>
<p>Memorial Meeting The Municipal Party Department, after receiving the order, decided to convene representatives from all walks of life at the party department's auditorium in Fenglinqiao at 10 AM tomorrow to hold a memorial meeting. The order of the memorial is as follows: Opening of the meeting, singing the party song, bowing three times to the party flag, the national flag, and Premier Sun Yat-sen's portrait, reading Premier Sun Yat-sen's will, silent tribute for three minutes, chairman's report, speeches, shouting slogans, conclusion of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Flying Flags at Half-Mast All agencies, groups, schools, and party departments at all levels in the city, because tomorrow is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the late Mr. Deng Zhongyuan, designated by the Central Government, will all follow the order to fly flags at half-mast for one day to express their condolences.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Authorities in the Two Concessions Interfere with the Collection of the Aviation Patriotic Fund; The Municipal Government Has Sent Personnel to Negotiate Separately <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the establishment of the China Aviation Association, it immediately began collecting donations in Shanghai. All citizens and organizations in the city are dedicated to the aviation patriotic movement. Hotel industries and other industries have voluntarily proposed collecting the aviation patriotic fund. The association believes that this matter concerns the people's patriotic enthusiasm and should be feasible. Prior to this, all industries were separately convened for consultation, and collection methods were formulated. Letters were sent to the government for approval and filing, and announcements were issued to inform the public. Letters were also sent to the authorities in the two concessions, requesting their strong support. The collection of donations from the hotel industry has been going on for a year, and people from all walks of life have voluntarily and enthusiastically donated, and the process is going smoothly. The concession authorities also believe that the Chinese people's voluntary donations are in line with the principles, so they have repeatedly replied that people should be willing. When the association collected aviation patriotic funds from dance halls last year, it received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council on August 8th, stating that the aviation patriotic fund had been agreed to by the consuls and could be implemented, but there should be no coercive actions. The authorities in the French Concession sent personnel to claim that they would do their best to support the aviation fund and that it could be implemented as long as people were willing to donate. Based on the above, the authorities in the two concessions not only expressed their agreement with the collection of aviation patriotic funds from various industries under the principle of voluntariness but also stated that they could assist. Now the association has received letters and telegrams from the Hotel Industry Association and various hotels reporting that on the 11th of this month, the political department of the French Concession Patrol House sent police to summon those in charge of various hotels, such as the Asia, Dafang, Dahu, Qin'an, Suotai'an, Shangzhan, Guangtailai, and Ping'an, to stop them from collecting aviation patriotic funds and revoke their business licenses. The same thing happened at the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession on the 19th. Police were sent to the Oriental, Jielu, Far East, Da Zhonghua, Shenzhou, Central, New World, Da Jiangnan, Hongkou, and Lingnan hotels, not only interfering with the collection but also taking away all the receipt books and account books. This matter concerns the Chinese people's voluntary donations, and the concession authorities have interfered and taken away the receipts, which is an unreasonable act and greatly violates public opinion. People from all walks of life are paying close attention. It is heard that the China Aviation Association is investigating the truth and will hold a meeting to discuss it soon. It is also heard that the Municipal Government has sent Secretaries Zhang Tingrong and Geng Jiaqi to negotiate. In addition, since the city initiated fundraising to celebrate President Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, it has been actively promoted in recent days. Wu Tiecheng, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wu Xianshi, Pan Gongbi, Yu Zuoting, Yao Xijiu, Li Dachao, Lu Bohong, Gu Shengyi, Zhang Shoulin, and others are serving as members, who are natural initiators. Letters have also been sent to various organizations and leaders from all walks of life, such as Yang Hu, Li Ting'an, Li Dengyao, Guo Zhengyang, Wang Yunwu, Tang Hai'an, Yuan Ludeng, Song Ziliang, Huang Jinrong, Huang Bosun, Wang Xiaoying, Yao Mulian, Wu Qiding, Xu Fengxian, Lu Jingshi, Huang Yanpei, Zhu Qinglan, Chen Taoyi, and Xu Jianping, and hundreds of others, to participate as initiators of fundraising to purchase aircraft for birthday congratulations. It is also heard that the Stock Exchange Federation, Ningbo Fellow Association, Guangdong Fellow Association, and others are actively raising funds to purchase aircraft with great enthusiasm.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Ministry of Finance Has Formulated Regulations for Handling Smuggled Goods <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has now formulated nine articles of regulations for handling smuggled goods seized by its subordinate anti-smuggling agencies, in order to facilitate their handling and avoid disputes. They are recorded as follows: (Article 1) The customs, taxation, and salt anti-smuggling agencies under the Ministry of Finance shall, in addition to assisting each other as much as possible in anti-smuggling matters, handle the confiscation and rewards of all smuggled goods seized from each other in accordance with these regulations. (Article 2) Smuggled goods (including smuggled salt) and criminals seized by anti-smuggling agencies that are not under the jurisdiction of their own agency shall be sent to the nearest competent agency for handling in accordance with regulations. However, if the seized smuggled salt is dirty, of poor quality, unfit for consumption, or cannot be sold, the seizing agency shall notify the nearest salt agency to send personnel to destroy it if necessary. In addition, if the seized imported smuggled goods require the payment of both customs duties and taxes under the jurisdiction of the Tax Affairs Department, they shall be sent to the customs for handling in places where customs are established, and to the tax office in places where customs are not established. The handling agency shall consult with the relevant agencies before handling the above items, and the handling agency shall inform the relevant agencies of the handling situation for verification. (Article 3) The means of transporting public or private smuggled goods, such as ships, aircraft, vehicles, livestock, etc., shall be handled by the seizing agency in accordance with regulations depending on the circumstances. (Article 4) All agencies that send the seized smuggled goods and criminals to the nearest competent agency in accordance with Article 2 of these regulations shall receive reimbursement for all expenses actually incurred, such as shipping costs, by presenting formal receipts to the nearest competent agency. (Article 5) All money confiscated or sold from the smuggled goods and criminals sent by the seizing agency to the nearest competent agency in accordance with regulations shall be distributed in the following proportions after deducting the expenses reimbursed in Article 4 and the expenses incurred during the sale: 40% for the treasury, 30% for the personnel who seized the goods, and 30% for the delivery to the treasury. The proportion to be received by the informant and the personnel involved shall be paid by the handling agency after receiving the money. If there are fines, they shall also be handled in the same way, unless there are special regulations for customs and taxation (such as smuggled cigarette paper), in which case this article shall not apply. (Article 6) No bonuses shall be given for smuggled goods that cannot be sold due to damage or special reasons, or for dirty, poor-quality smuggled salt that is unfit for consumption and should be destroyed in accordance with Article 2. Article 8 does not apply in this case. (Article 7) If smuggled goods cannot be sold, all expenses that should be allocated according to Article 4 shall still be requested by the handling agency for separate reimbursement. (Article 8) If the personnel who seized the smuggled goods have made special contributions and need to be rewarded generously, and the seized goods cannot be sold, the handling agency shall request a separate reward. (Article 9) These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Director Lin Jinyu of the Shanghai Audit Office went to Nanjing to seek instructions from the ministry because the office will handle the audit of state-run agencies. Mr. Lin has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. It is learned that the ministry has agreed to this matter in principle, but it still needs to be planned as a whole, so it plans to consider it and make a decision in the shortest possible time, and then order the office to comply. Mr. Lin also plans to go to Nanjing again in the middle of next month to seek instructions so that he can start handling it in the second half of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Taxpayer Association Regular Executive Committee Meeting to Discuss Solving Telephone Problems, Suggestions from Electrical Appliance Industry and Other Guilds <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Although the telephone problem in the special district has reached a stalemate due to the company's stubbornness, all sectors feel deeply affected and public opinion continues to criticize without hesitation. The Taxpayer Association of the concession has regularly convened an executive committee meeting to seek a solution. Yesterday, the Electrical Appliance Industry, Wire and Iron Machinery Industry, and other guilds sent a letter to the Special District Telephone Committee, suggesting three ways to deal with the problem. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Telephone Problem Committee from various guilds such as the Telephone Industry: With respect, the Shanghai Telephone Company, in this difficult commercial time, changed the new telephone charging regulations, disregarding the public opinion of all citizens, and resolutely implemented them. Although your committee and other representatives of the citizens have tried their best to protest, the effect is minimal. All members of our guilds are part of the citizens and are all telephone users. We are willing to be a strong backing for the enthusiastic protests of your committee and offer our humble opinions to your committee as a basis for continued negotiations. We hope for your wise decision. We present our opinions in detail below. Upon investigation, the only reason for the Shanghai Telephone Company's change of regulations is to achieve an annual interest rate of 10%. According to the internal organization of the company obtained by our guilds, the company still cannot achieve an annual interest rate of 10% even after the price increase. There are several reasons for this: A. The basic major shareholder of the company is a certain American telephone company. B. The company uses new telephones and other materials, all of which are supplied by a certain American telephone company, and the price exceeds the market price. (Please ask the committee to find a way to investigate this price.) C. The Shanghai Telephone Company's profit cannot reach an annual interest rate of 10% because this profit has already been taken away by a certain American telephone company. Therefore, the Shanghai company cannot directly obtain an annual interest rate of 10%, but it has been indirectly taken away by the major shareholder, a certain American telephone company. In the future, when the company purchases telephone materials, it should determine the type of goods the company needs, formulate procedures, and invite merchants to bid, so that the lowest price can be obtained. In this way, the company can also make a profit. Stopping payment is not a fundamental solution for continued negotiation and it is difficult to achieve final victory. The reason is that the method of stopping payment has been adopted in the past, but the company uses the method of breaking through individually, and the result is almost zero. For example, if 100 users stop paying, the company will disconnect the lines of 10 of these 100 non-paying users, and the remaining 90 users can still make calls even if they do not pay. Therefore, the 10 households whose lines are disconnected will inevitably panic and feel inconvenienced. After insisting for a few days, they feel that the negotiation is still ineffective, so they have to pay and ask for the phone to be reconnected. After the company waits for the 10 households whose lines are disconnected to pay, it will disconnect the lines of another 10 households among the other 90 households. Following the above method, it will be applied to the remaining non-paying users one by one. Therefore, although there are many users in Shanghai, they are broken through one by one. Therefore, our guilds feel that this method of stopping payment is difficult to be effective. To continue the protest, we must be determined to sacrifice. The first step is to dismantle the telephones: A. Organize a telephone dismantling opportunity, send personnel to various industry guilds and citizen district branches to contact them, and convene a general meeting within three days. The user affiliated with the various industries, and users who have a relationship with various personal users, the responsible party of the meeting should be the various industry guild to host, and other personal users who do not belong to various industries should be hosted by the civic association. B. Users must fill in a letter of commitment to dismantle the telephone and store it in the respective groups. C. Each user should write a letter to the telephone company in advance, stating that they request the company to dismantle the telephone immediately, and attach a statement that if the telephone is not dismantled after the deadline, the user will cut the line themselves, and the user will not be responsible for any fees or damage losses. The letter must be signed and sealed and stored in each of the organizing groups. If necessary, the organizing groups may send the letter to the Shanghai Telephone Company on their behalf. The above methods are within the scope of our guilds' humble opinions. We hope that your committee will study them in detail and inform us accordingly. We hope for your consideration and a reply.</p>
<p>Taxpayer Association: The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession issued a notice yesterday, which reads: With respect, it is scheduled to hold the seventh executive committee meeting at 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday, March 15, in the upstairs hall of our association at 59 Hong Kong Road. We hope that you will take the time to attend the meeting on time to discuss the telephone issue. Respectfully issued.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Fishermen in Wanhai Petition the Ministry of Finance to Improve the Color Change of Salt Used for Fish Preservation and Request to Use Rice Bran Instead <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shin Shi News Agency, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association received a letter from representatives of fishermen in Daishan, Dinghai County, stating that the Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy of the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent government and private salt from being mixed and resold, ordered the fishermen in the area to mix red soil or coal dust into the salt used for pickling fish and crabs in order to identify it. This method affects the color of the fresh fish, and customers who are unaware may easily misunderstand it, mistaking the fresh fish for rotten fish, which is a major concern for the livelihood of the fishermen. Therefore, they requested the Ministry of Finance to change the method and offered suggestions for adoption. After receiving the letter, the association sent separate letters to the Ministry of Finance, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy yesterday, which read: With respect, according to the representatives of fishermen in Daishan, Dinghai County, Han Xiangzhou, Huang Jun, Zhao Changwei, Zhou Peifu, etc., in recent years, the economic downturn has spread throughout the country, and the social economy has undergone drastic changes. All industries are declining, especially the fishing industry. For example, in the past, fishermen could sell the fish and crabs they caught for 100 yuan, but now they can only sell them for 40 or 50 yuan, and sometimes no one even asks about them. At a time when fishermen are struggling to survive, the government suddenly issued an order to change the color of salt used for fishing, ordering fishermen to mix red soil into the salt used for pickling fish and crabs to make the salt red, or mix coal dust to make it gray. The original intention was nothing more than to identify government and private salt and prevent mixing and reselling. However, those who buy fish and crabs in the market judge the freshness of the fish based on their appearance and set the price accordingly. The freshness of the fish depends on the scales and gills. White scales are considered fresh and sell for a higher price, while black scales are considered stale and unfit for consumption. As for red, it is not suitable. For example, dried fish that are originally white will turn red or gray when they are moldy and taste astringent. Now, the fresh and delicious fish and crabs are dyed with colored salt, which customers misunderstand as rotten. All goods will inevitably be unsalable, which will not only affect the livelihood of the fishermen, but also reduce the country's tax revenue. The representatives grew up in the fishing area and have a better understanding of the situation. They cannot bear to see hundreds of thousands of fishermen sit and wait for death. After research, they have found a method that does not violate the law and does not affect the quality of the fish, which is to mix rice bran into the salt used for fishing to make the salt slightly yellow. This can both identify the salt used for fishing and not affect the color and taste of the fish. Fishermen will naturally be happy to comply. Compared with mixing red soil or coal dust to change the color, which is both labor-intensive and affects hygiene, this method has many advantages and no disadvantages. At a time when the fishing industry is declining, the government is paying more attention to protecting it. Weighing the pros and cons, it seems that it should be adopted. Therefore, we briefly state the reasons for changing to using rice bran to mix with fishing salt, and sincerely request your association to present it to the government on our behalf. Please consider the difficulties of the people and allow the change to be made in order to maintain the fishing industry and benefit the people's livelihood. etc. After investigation, the association found that the color and taste changes caused by mixing red soil or coal dust with salt for pickling fresh fish do affect sales, which is indeed the case. Based on the above situation, we are specially presenting it on behalf of the fishermen. We sincerely hope that you will consider it, issue an order for implementation, and maintain the fishing industry. We will be deeply grateful. This is addressed to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Liangzhe Salt Transport Envoy.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Registered Opium Smokers in This City Will Exchange for New Licenses Next Month <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Anti-Smoking Section has been registering opium smokers in Shanghai since July of last year. More than 30,000 people have registered or quit, with excellent results. According to the section's news yesterday, the registration certificates issued to opium smokers are exchanged every six months. All opium smokers who registered in July of last year, October, or even the end of December must exchange for new licenses for 1936 on the first day of next month. Those who do not register will not be allowed to smoke. The Anti-Smoking Association is currently drafting a law on opium smokers voluntarily reporting illegal activities, which may be implemented soon. It was also said that the situation in Shanghai is complicated and it is quite inconvenient to handle anti-smoking matters. For example, the fact that opium licenses are not valid in the concessions is one aspect. Our government authorities are determined to find ways to consult with the concession authorities to handle this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting Correction of Stamp Tax Inspectors' Abuse of Power in Sending Penalties <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Straw Hat Industry Association, sent a telegram yesterday to the Ministry of Finance requesting correction of stamp tax inspectors' intentional fault-finding, unwarranted demands, and abuse of power in sending penalties. The telegram read: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, (omitted above). According to the regulations in the tax exemption column of the stamp tax rate table and the Ministry's tax document No. 7298, workers' wage account books used to collect wages are exempt from stamp tax. The document also states that 'If workers other than employees of a store receive wages or remuneration, and the store issues account books for them to collect their wages, these account books can be handled accordingly.' Therefore, regardless of whether an industry has a business license or not, if workers in straw hat-making shops, that is, those who work at home, use account books to collect their wages, they are exempt from stamp tax according to the Ministry's above-mentioned instructions. The model of the rental books issued by the Public Security Bureau has been submitted to the Ministry for review. According to the Ministry's tax document No. 8254 of December 31 of last year, the lease agreement on the first page should be affixed with a stamp worth two cents. However, two points should be supplemented: The rental book is issued by the Public Security Bureau once a year, and its validity period is only twelve months. However, the lease is signed after moving into a new house, and its validity continues until moving out or increasing/decreasing the rent or revising a new lease. It is not revised every twelve months. Therefore, tenants are legally not required to affix a stamp to the lease agreement every year. According to the law, stamp tax should be affixed to leases with a monthly rent of ten yuan or more. However, according to the inspectors' claim, it seems that all leases, regardless of the monthly rent, must be affixed with a stamp worth two cents, which is also obviously inconsistent. As for the rental book of the Public Security Bureau, a piece of paper called a rent ticket is cut off each month when collecting rent, which is different from the method used in inland areas outside Shanghai, where rent is collected annually and stamp tax is affixed to the books. Therefore, according to the Ministry's tax document No. 8254, since each receipt has been stamped, the booklet should not be stamped again according to Article 12 of the Implementing Rules of the Stamp Tax Law. The inspectors have repeatedly made unwarranted demands and abused their power in sending penalties for the above two items of account books and rental books, and the court has also imposed penalties without knowing the previous cases, which is inevitable. We request that the Ministry provide a thorough explanation and issue a notice for compliance to avoid merchants suffering injustice again. According to Article 12 of the Implementing Rules of the Stamp Tax Law, check stub books do not need to be stamped. Although check have been temporarily exempted from stamp tax, the application of Article 12 of the Implementing Rules remains unchanged. We also request that the Ministry verify and instruct for compliance. If the loose-leaf receipts are for sending money or goods, they should be affixed with a total of two cents each year. If the content of the invoice stub is completely the same as the first copy given to the customer, because it is a duplicate, or if the content is simpler than the copy given to the customer, it is also used for internal audit. According to Article 3, Clause 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, it is not necessary to stamp them. There is no doubt about the above two items according to the law, and we have already provided answers to the association. However, in order to avoid inspectors intentionally finding fault, we still request that the Ministry provide a combined reply for reference. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Election and Campaign of British, American, and Japanese Nationals <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, the election of the new directors of the Municipal Council is scheduled to be held on Monday and Tuesday this week. This is because the Japanese nationals have nominated three candidates, hoping to win one more seat on the Municipal Council. If the Japanese win, it will inevitably sacrifice one seat of the British or Americans. Therefore, the British, American, and Japanese sides have been engaged in election campaigns for days, sparing no effort. They have printed pamphlets, mailed letters, made telephone calls, and used newspapers run by their nationals to advise voters and promote their candidates in every possible way. The American Nationals Election Committee has made telephone calls to each voter, and it is said that they will continue to do so on Monday. The British nationals have been told to unite to elect British and American candidates. It is said that the Japanese nationals are also united and intend to compete with the British and Americans. British and American voters will of course elect candidates of their own nationality. What is noteworthy is that there are about 1,000 non-Japanese voters, including 200 Germans and 200 Russians. The German nationals have received letters from Japanese election campaigners asking them to elect three Japanese candidates, but the German nationals do not seem to support changing the current state of the Municipal Council, so they will not comply with the Japanese request. The Russian nationals will also support European candidates. However, the Portuguese nationals may take this opportunity to express their dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's unfair hiring of Portuguese employees. The Municipal Council has hired Mr. Weir and Mr. Paulsen as vote counters, and both have accepted the invitation.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Executive Committee Member of the National Medical Association, Yang Yanhe, Researches the Results of Insects and Purple Gromwell <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Industry Association previously sent a letter to the National Medical Association, asking for identification of the authenticity of ground beetles and false blister beetles, and the differences between purple gromwell root and purple gromwell velvet, and attached four medicines to the association. After deliberation by the National Medical Association, "it was sent to medical groups and executive and supervisory committee members of the association for research, opinions were collected, and then discussed." Mr. Yang Yanhe, a member of the executive committee of the association, sent a letter yesterday to the National Medical Association with the results of his research, which read: "With respect, I have received your letter and a book on the identification of ground beetles and false blister beetles, and the identification of purple gromwell root and purple gromwell velvet. Ground beetles are indeed false blister beetles. The herbal classic already has clear records and medical books can be used to verify each other (such as Wu Youke's Treatise on Pestilential Diseases, which uses Sanjia Powder to treat "principal and secondary pathogens," explicitly stating false blister beetle, while Xue Shengbai's Treatise on Damp-Heat Diseases, which treats "principal and secondary pathogens combined," imitating Wu Youke's Sanjia Powder, directly writes ground turtle beetle, which can be used for mutual verification). However, the pharmacy must not prepare other insects to impersonate ground beetles. The main question has been resolved. As for the purple gromwell velvet, Xie Yuqiong's Complete Book for Saving Lives in Ma Ke states, 'Purple gromwell velvet is formed by the ants on the dragon's blood tree gathering its fat and liquid, which is no different from bees making honey. The one from the True Wax Kingdom is the best, and the one from the Persian Kingdom is the next best. It treats wounds, collapse and leakage, breaks up blood stasis, promotes muscle growth, and stops pain. The world now uses it exclusively to treat pox because it has the effect of activating blood and promoting swelling without the harm of being salty and cold and causing diarrhea. Its effect is twice that of purple gromwell, so it is called purple gromwell velvet, but it is not the same type as purple gromwell.' When Yanhe read this book before, he added a brief note on the eyebrow, saying, 'Purple gromwell velvet is originally the tender stem of purple gromwell, while the purple gromwell velvet recorded by Xie is actually purple mineral.' Based on Xie's records and the records in the Herbal Materia Medica, True Secrets of Pox Learning, Divine Response Heart Book, and the Purple Fish Article in the Compendium of Materia Medica, they are in agreement. The Chinese Medical Dictionary clearly states in the Purple Mineral Article, 'Purple mineral is produced in the Southern Barbarians. It is a kind of small insect like ants and lice that gather its fat and liquid on tree branches to form, colored purple and shaped like mineral stones. When broken open, it is red and transparent like amber. It treats pox and has the effect of activating blood and promoting swelling without the effect of being cold, salty, and causing diarrhea. Its effect is twice that of purple gromwell.' The doubt of Zhao Xuemin, who said, 'According to Ye Dachun, it seems to be purple mineral, but there is no definite explanation,' has been resolved. Therefore, doctors who write prescriptions for measles can draw 'tender purple gromwell,' while those who write prescriptions for pox must change the writing to 'like purple mineral' or 'purple mineral velvet' to avoid unclear entanglement. Please also ask the association to send a circular to medical groups all over the country to inform members, and also send a letter to the Chinese Medicine Industry Association to inform colleagues all over the country to follow the same procedure to avoid misunderstandings, which is really a blessing for patients."</p>

<h3 id="e125">YMCA Seeking Donations: Second Announcement <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's fundraising campaign is being conducted in two ways: seeking memberships and soliciting donations. Since its opening, the membership recruitment has been very enthusiastic. The results of the first announcement have already been detailed in previous reports. However, due to a later start, the fundraising results have not yet been announced. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, the fundraising committee's chairman group, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Wang Xiaolai, held a tea party at the Hua'an Building, inviting donation committee members and team leaders. Those present included Lin Kanghou, Zhu Yinjiang, Wu Qiding, Yuan Ludeng, Qin Runqing, Zhang Weiru, Sheng Pingcheng, Dong Kechang, Rong Zongjing, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yiting, Wang Yansong, Wang Binyan, Zhu Daqi, Shen Shuwang, Zhu Meixian, Zhou Yu, Yao Mulian, Hu Guigeng, Xu Fu, Xu Peihuang, Sun Hengfu, Xi E'xian, Ma Yinliang, Zhang Zhuping, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Shulin, Lu Wenshao, Lu Gongfu, Qiao Jinliang, Jing Qiankun, Liu Hongsheng, Zheng Zenan, Zhu Wenqi, Gu Xinyi, Cheng Lian, Zai Boqi, Lu Gaoyi, Shi Zhikun, and others, totaling more than one hundred people, a very grand occasion. The order of events began with speeches by chairmen Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai, briefly stating that the YMCA's work is beneficial to the country and society, which is known to all and need not be elaborated upon. Since the association has no permanent assets and no foundation, all operating expenses are dependent on the annual fundraising. This year's fundraising campaign opened on March 9, with sixty membership recruitment teams proceeding very smoothly. However, the fundraising teams were organized somewhat late, and the donations from various donation committee members have not been delivered as scheduled. As the fundraising period is short and the closing date is approaching, it is hoped that the committee members will act quickly to complete this endeavor. Following this, Mr. Yang Yihui, the association's deputy general secretary, reported on the progress of the fundraising campaign. Lin Kanghou, Wang Yansong, Yuan Ludeng, and Liu Zhanen also gave speeches, requesting people from all walks of life to do their best to solicit donations to promote its success. The spirit was extremely uplifting. Finally, Mr. Lu Shichen, the association's general secretary, expressed his gratitude. It was after five o'clock when everyone happily dispersed.</p>
<p>Membership Recruitment</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th, it was also the date of the second announcement. From four o'clock in the afternoon, the scores of each team were sent to the office one after another. This time, the score was 13,631 points, which, together with the 24,546 points from the previous period, totaled 38,177 points, already exceeding half of the overall goal. There are still two weeks left in the fundraising time, and the team leaders and team members are all striving forward bravely. The goal of 60,000 yuan should not be a problem. Thirty-five teams submitted scores this time. The scores of the top ten teams in this period are listed below:</p>
<p>First place: Zhang Yuliang team with 1145 points</p>
<p>Second place: Chen Jian'an team with 841 points</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration reports that since it began offering postal simple life insurance services, it has spared no effort in promoting it. The Administration has received approval from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to add simple life insurance services to seven branches in the city from April 1 of this year, including those on Carter Road, Kaze Road, Woma Road, Zhabei, Avenue Joffre, Tilanqiao, and Jing'an Temple.

<h3 id="e127">Can Zhu Xueying Escape the Inferno? Feelings of Then and Now in the Brothel, Zhang Guilan Detained for Discussing Price <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Xueying, a woman from Songjiang, is 18 years old and a famous prostitute in the Sichunlou brothel at 4 Mindeli, Fuzhou Road. Due to the social and economic depression, the prostitution business has also declined, and income has sharply decreased. Sichunlou is naturally no exception, resulting in heavy debts and difficulty in maintaining operations. Zhu has also lost her foothold. Her mother, in February of last year, mortgaged her to the madam Yang Dazhen (also known as Xiaoniangyi, from Qingjiang) for 500 yuan to become a street prostitute. A high-class brothel prostitute has been transformed into the lowest form of "wild chicken", standing on the street all day long, suffering from the wind and frost, fearing that she will not be able to receive customers and fearing the arrest of detectives. Compared with her previous life in the brothel, the difference is like heaven and earth. Her suffering is self-evident. Yang Dazhen's brothel is located in the front and rear buildings at No. 15, Ping'anli, Lane 604, Fuzhou Road, and the Wujin Elementary School is located downstairs. In addition to Zhu, there is also the prostitute Wang Jinbao and three servants. The prostitution business is still considered good. Although Zhu has suffered all kinds of hardships, she has nowhere to turn for justice. However, Zhu's matter was discovered by the Citizens' Federation, which recently sent a letter to the Zhabei Police Station to report it. Western Police Chief Fang, Detective San, Head 1013, went to investigate and rescued Zhu from the pit of fire, and also arrested Yang Dazhen, the prostitute Wang Jinbao, and three servants. At that time, a 14-year-old Jiangbei woman, Zhang Guilan, accompanied by a man and a woman, slowly walked upstairs. When the man and woman saw the police, they turned around and fled, but Zhang was detained by the police. According to Zhang's confession, the man's name is Zhang Ziqing, and the woman's name is Heipi Laosan. She was previously sold to Heipi Laosan, who transferred her to a street brothel on Baliqiao Road in the French Concession. She was now planning to sell her to Yang Dazhen. She came to discuss the price. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, apart from the prostitute Wang and the three servants, who were sent to the Petty Offenses Court of the First Special District Court for punishment, Yang Dazhen was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Wang Yaochang clarified the previous situation and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated that Zhu was currently suffering from a throat disease, but it was caused by venereal disease and had not yet been tested, so he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Then Zhu and Zhang successively submitted reports on their experiences of falling into prostitution. When questioned, Yang Dazhen confessed to opening the street brothel. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confessions and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another hearing in a week.</p>

<p>Ji Xiaosanzi, a woman from Jiangbei, is 21 years old. In June of the 19th year of the Republic of China, she married Qi Douyuan, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker. After living together for more than a year, Qi, due to economic pressure, colluded with his cousin and, in October of the 20th year of the Republic of China, devised a plan to lure Ji out, falsely claiming they were going to see a play, and took her to the brothel (commonly known as "saltwater girl") opened by a woman named Zhong Fubao at No. 22, Tongshengli, Xianshi Road, Hongkou, forcing her into prostitution. At that time, Qi obtained 240 yuan as her price. Ji was only 16 years old at the time, young and ignorant, and forced by his power, she had no way to resist and had to obey the orders of the madam and take up the life of a prostitute. For five years, she welcomed Zhang and sent Wei, enduring great suffering. In December of last year</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Warner Oland, a Swedish film star who became famous in Hollywood for playing the Chinese detective Charlie Chan, will arrive in Shanghai at 1:30 PM today aboard the Asia Empress. The ship will dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Since 1931, he has played the main character, Detective Charlie Chan, in several detective films. Up to the recent film "Shanghai Bloodshed" (which will soon be shown in Shanghai), he has starred in as many as ten films. Not only does his appearance not require makeup, it is similar to that of people from the Orient, and his restrained performance also makes those who do not understand the Eastern situation interested. Most of the Chinese characters in Western films are low-class, and only Charlie Chan is slightly different, so some people think of him as someone who has brought a little face to the Chinese. It is said that after staying in Shanghai for three to five days, he often goes to Nanjing and Peiping for sightseeing.</p>

<p>Shen Xiaomao, a native of Huzhou, had two disciples named Yang Jinchu (i.e., someone with pockmarks) and Chen Youfa (i.e., Sanguang Pockmark). They were arrested and sent to court for a wounding case and sentenced to imprisonment. However, Shen Xiaomao believed that their arrest was due to Weng Longping, a native of Wujiang living at No. 24 at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Tibet Road, who had informed on them. He held a grudge and wanted to avenge his disciples. Therefore, at 2:30 PM on October 7th of last year, Shen, together with five accomplices, each carrying axes and wooden sticks, rushed to Weng's house and slashed and beat Weng, causing him to be injured all over his body, with the most serious injury being to his right shoulder. Weng's wife, Gu, was also injured on both arms. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a panic. Afterwards, the Xinzha Police Station sent detectives to the scene and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment, and at the same time requested the court to issue an arrest warrant. At about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, Xinzha Police Station detectives Tao Rubi and Ye Yushan arrested Shen Xiaomao in room 354 of the Dajiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road.

Prosecutor Yang Rushu interrogated him and found that the case was clear, so he filed a public prosecution. Later, because Liu Zirong withdrew the charges against Xi, Xi Yunqing was released, and only Wu Wenxiang was sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment. Wu refused to accept the sentence and hired a lawyer to file an appeal. The Local Procuratorate escorted Wu Wenxiang to Suzhou. On the 5th of this month, Judge Wang of the Jiangsu High Court summoned him. Xi Yunqing did not arrive. Wu Wenxiang completely blamed Xi for the adultery and was ordered to be detained and re-examined after witnesses were summoned.

Their methods were superb, and once they started, it was difficult for the owners to recover their bicycles. Last month, the Central Police Station arrested the above-mentioned criminals and sent them to the First Special Court for sentencing. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Guo Jingqing (27 years old, native of Tianjin), a receiving and dispatching police officer from the First Section of the Chinese Public Security Bureau, was riding a bicycle to the post office on Kaizi'er Road in the French Concession to deliver a letter when Wu Jinsheng, an accomplice of Yang Zihua, stole the bicycle and fled. The owner noticed this and chased Wu to the Empire Cinema, where he caught Wu red-handed and took him to the police station. Wu confessed that Yang Zihua and others had been sentenced in the First Special Court and admitted that he had stolen a total of 67 bicycles in the French Concession. The police chief obtained the confession and ordered detectives Zai Hao, Bao Tan Ding Wensheng, and Yang Weishan to go to the First Special Court to bring back the three criminals Yang Zihua and others. The French Police then arrested Huang Guisheng and Zhu Yongxian, the two receivers of stolen goods, and recovered more than ten stolen bicycles.

The police chief obtained the confession and sent another detective to the address to arrest Yang Yongcai and bring him to the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang said that this was an assistance case and requested that it be investigated.

<p>Most of the famous novels of the Ming Dynasty, such as "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Jin Ping Mei Cihua," have printed editions. However, "The Unofficial History of Chan Zhen," compiled by Qingxi Daoren, has been rarely circulated. Although it is also a novel, the narratives are all based on historical facts. It is said that the events are well-founded and the language is organized. The rise and fall of the two dynasties are as clear as day, and the geographical map of the era is as brilliant as the stars. Focusing on Emperor Wu of Liang's belief in Buddhism and extending to Emperor Yang of Sui, the history is filled with poems, songs, jokes, and ridicule, thoroughly satirizing human nature and depicting the extremities of society. The work comprises 600,000 words, printed in two thick volumes, and is collated by Zhang Jinglu. It is listed as the 29th title in the "Rare Books of Chinese Literature" series. The popular edition is priced at only one yuan, and the special edition is one yuan and forty cents, which is nearly 80% cheaper than the original woodblock version.

<p>Sea jellyfish, also known as "zhepi," are produced in large quantities in the islands outside Wusongkou, such as Sijiao and Shengshan. They are transported by Ningbo fishing boats to Wusong, Shanghai, Suzhou, and other inland areas for sale. Wusong is the most important distribution center. Wang Pingcheng and Liu Jinshan, Ningbo merchants stationed in Wusong, have observed that the producers are sticking to the old ways and not focusing on improving the quality of the products, resulting in sluggish sales in various regions and inconsistent prices. Therefore, they have established the Zhepigong Institute at 97 Tongxing Road in Wusong to promote improvement and consolidation. The producers believe that the institute is highly beneficial to the production and interests of fishermen, so all cargo ships arriving in Wusong are required to report to the institute first.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing in regards to an article that you recently published in your local city news column. The article, titled "Hoodlums Gather at the Yihe Wharf in Hongkou to Gamble and Assault People," makes claims about a man named Shu Bin that are factually incorrect. The article claims, "A gambler named Wang Shubin operates a food shop at 220 Huaji Road. However, he enjoys gambling and goes to gamble every day. Yesterday, he suddenly had a dispute with a group of hoodlums over a trivial matter and suffered serious injuries." The facts of the case do not reflect what has been written in this article. I, Wang Shubin, operate the Dongmaoju Tianjin restaurant at 220 Huaji Road. Sailors frequently accumulate debt on their meals at my restaurant. Yesterday, I went to collect on these debts, and the debtors refused to pay. Instead, they ganged up and assaulted me. The claim that I, Shubin, am a gambler is false. It is merely hearsay. I am concerned that this will create a misunderstanding amongst the general public. Therefore, I request that you please correct the article as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wang Shubin</p>
<p>March 1, 25th year</p>

<h3 id="e159">After the Junior Cup, Youyou Wins the North China Daily News Cup. Defeated St. Francis 3-2 in Yesterday's Final. Youyou Led 2-0 in the First Half <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>After defeating Lancashire to win the Junior Cup last week, the Youyou B team defeated St. Francis 3-2 at the Shen Garden yesterday to win the North China Daily News Cup. Because both teams had evenly matched talent and many outstanding players, the game was very competitive and exciting. Youyou scored two goals in the first half, establishing a solid foundation. In the second half, St. Francis counterattacked strongly and also scored two goals, making the situation tense. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui's agility allowed Youyou to score a third goal, winning the game 3-2. These two teams were also the finalists for this cup last year, with St. Francis winning the championship. Each team has won one final in two years, which can be said to be a fair exchange.</p>
<p>Two Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>St. Francis has famous Portuguese players such as Foun Endeaye and So Sek, while Youyou has Xu Jiaokui, Xi Qiaosheng, Zhang Rong, etc. The central defender Lei Lianjin is a rare talent. Both sides were determined to win, and each did their best in offense and defense. However, St. Francis' coordination was not yet perfect, and Xu Wenkui, Xi Qiaosheng, and Luo Douwen repeatedly broke through their defense. Xu Wenkui opened the scoring, and Xi Qiaosheng added another goal. Although the St. Francis goalkeeper was good, he could not avoid a loss. Although Youyou's defense was alarmed several times, Zhu Qiu and others defended effectively, preserving their lead. Starting in the second half, Youyou continued to attack, and their momentum was still strong. However, St. Francis was unwilling to give in and tried to recover the lost goals. Foun, a young player who had been selected as a Shanghai Interport team member, was closely guarded by Yang Jinling and Zhang. The ball was shifted to the left and center. Portuguese star Endeaye broke into Youyou's goal area. Zhang Rong illegally tackled him in a dangerous situation, resulting in a penalty kick, which was kicked in by central defender Boer Tai. After losing the opportunity, St. Francis made a comeback. So Sek shot, and Foun rushed up to sweep the ball in. Wang Caigao rushed out to save the ball and fell to the ground. The ball fell to the side, and Wallach kicked it into the goal, tying the score at 2-2.</p>
<p>A Victory by a Narrow Margin</p>
<p>After that, the situation became even more intense. After Youyou kicked off from the center, they went straight to the enemy camp in one go. Ya Rent's ball handling mistake sparked a prairie fire. Then, Balo Ting made the same mistake. Xu Wenkui fought from east to west, got the ball, and shot, scoring the winning goal. Youyou then took the lead 3-2. St. Francis attacked several times, but Yan Lianjin defended the center with stability and experience. Even in several dangerous situations, Wang Caigao was able to turn the danger into safety. In front of the St. Francis goal, the Youyou forwards were seen darting in and out. The goalkeeper's technique was excellent, saving countless dangerous balls. When time ran out, Youyou avenged last year's defeat and won the North China Daily News Cup.</p>

<h3 id="e160">With Peace of Mind, Youyou Wins. Each Team Scored One Goal in Each Half. Although Donghua Lost, Their Attack Was Fierce. Tomorrow, Donghua Forfeits <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After the North China Daily News Cup final between Youyou B and St. Francis ended, the two Youyou A and Donghua A teams played their first match of the season in the West League A at 3:45 PM. Donghua's Li Ning and Li Yichen were injured in the game against French Commerce last Sunday and were still unable to play yesterday, which led to a major adjustment of the lineup. With no one in the back, Cao Qiuting and the unknown Zhuang Youren were used, and the strength was greatly reduced. The central defense line was under extra pressure and did its best to fight. The forwards were closely guarded by Youyou and had few opportunities to move. As a result, Youyou won 2-0. Youyou's forwards were really worthless. They could neither coordinate nor score. Xiao Heitan was almost a waste and was far inferior to what he used to be. Youyou's defenders have made considerable progress, and Jiang Shanjing is the best, the most outstanding Chinese inside guard in Shanghai at present.</p>
<p>Youyou Relies Entirely on Defensive Solidity</p>
<p>There were only three to four thousand spectators in the Shen Garden grandstand, scattered around. The atmosphere was more orderly and harmonious than in previous matches between the two teams. The two teams competed very politely. The 90-minute contest was courteous and devoid of any fiery atmosphere. The players of the two teams were originally friends. After Donghua kicked off, Youyou's front line showed weakness and disorder. Donghua had a clear advantage, with crisp feet and coordinated connections. Chen Dehui and Dai Linjing attacked the goal one after another. Jiang Shanjing was full of courage, using both his head and feet, without any mistakes. Zhang Rongcai also saved many dangerous balls. Sun Qing repeatedly responded to the opportunity to shoot, but Liang Tang was always closely watching and guarding him. If Youyou's defense had not been solid, they would have been in danger of losing at that time.</p>
<p>Donghua Loses First but Counterattacks Fiercely</p>
<p>Donghua's attack was fierce, but the interior defense was inevitably empty. Zhong Yu got the ball and went straight to the goal. Cao Qiu wanted to move forward but could not. Zhong calmly passed the ball to the goal. Xu Jingcheng was in a very good position and got the ball, taking advantage of the situation to shoot. The momentum was very strong, but unexpectedly, it bounced off the goal frame and returned. Chen won the ball and passed it to Shu Tang. Liang shot immediately, piercing the corner of the goal, making it clear that Youyou scored first. The generals continued to attack, and the momentum was still very strong, causing Youyou to have difficulty parrying, forming a one-sided situation for Donghua. In the end, Youyou's strict defense prevented Donghua from finding any gaps.</p>
<p>The Situation Becomes More Urgent, Youyou Scores Again</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, the situation was roughly the same. The spirits of both sides were uplifted, and the competitive situation was more intense than in the first half. Chen Dehui was extremely active and was one of the dangerous figures in Donghua's attack. In one fierce shot, Zhang Rongcai made a diagonal save. In another opportunity to win, he kicked it into a wild ball. Xiao Heitan Chen Zhenhe did not sweat at all in the first half. At this time, he also made great efforts, deciding to attack Donghua's goal single-handedly, arousing the spirits of many spectators. Unfortunately, Heitan lost his grip and could not control the opportunity, and the effort failed. After 15 minutes, Xu Jingcheng got a pass from Zhenxiang and sent it to the goal. Chen Zhenxiang feigned and gave it to Yongsen to attack, which was successful again.</p>
<p>Donghua Forfeits Today's Match</p>
<p>Donghua was attacking the temple, Jiang Shanjing decided to kick the ball, letting Zhang Jinhai sneak in to attack. Liang Shutang swooped up and took the lead, resolving this danger. Sun Jinshun also had a winning shot, but it bounced off the crossbar and over the back. With Donghua's strong offensive, they failed to score, which was truly unfortunate. As a result, Youyou won 2-0. The two teams were originally scheduled to play their second match at Yiyuan today, but because Donghua's lineup was incomplete, they voluntarily forfeited.</p>

<p>A Clever Move: Fudan Takes the Lead</p>
<p>The battle between Fudan and Ritsumeikan took place yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at Ritsumeikan. Referee Zhang Yuansheng blew the silver whistle, and both sides began to engage. Ritsumeikan's Zhou Chengyuan scored the first point with a shot. Fudan's Zhou Dayun made a beautiful shot under the basket, and Qiu Guangxie and Shen Chongjiao followed suit. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Ritsumeikan requested a timeout to discuss strategy. Sure enough, Lu Zhixin successfully attacked, and He Zheng made a sneak attack, tying the score. However, this good fortune did not last long. Fudan's momentum soared. Weng Ren'an dashed across the court, repeatedly launching surprise attacks. Chong Jing and Dayun coordinated, each displaying their skills. The score rapidly increased. Although Ritsumeikan replaced Yu Hewen with Lin Qiming in a desperate struggle, it was still ineffective. In the first half, Fudan took the lead with a score of 34 to 21.</p>
<p>Celebrating Victory: Ritsumeikan Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>Switching sides for the second half, Fudan also brought in fresh troops, replacing Shen Chongjing with Chuan Ruixiang. Fudan unleashed its military might. Zong Qi and Ren'an attacked from the left and right, while Lao Qiu coordinated from the center. Xiao Chuan made a solo breakthrough. In an instant, the score reached 47 to 23, putting them far ahead. Ritsumeikan requested a timeout, but there was still no improvement. Fudan continued to dominate. Dayun charged left and right, repeatedly displaying his amazing skills. When He Zheng fouled out and left the court, Ritsumeikan had no substitutes and could only fight with four players, further diminishing their morale. Fudan brought in a new player, Li Zongkun, to replace Weng Ren'an. The overall situation remained unchanged. Ritsumeikan's Zhou Cheng made a long-range shot, recovering one point. Fudan then sent Zheng Baiyi into the game to assist, and Dayun retired. Ruixiang scored two more free throws. Ritsumeikan's Qiu Qiming returned a ball. Fudan ultimately defeated Ritsumeikan with a score of 70 to 47. The lineups of both sides are as follows: First half: Fudan 34, Ritsumeikan 21. Second half: Fudan 36, Ritsumeikan 26.</p>
<p>Jinan Defeats Guanghua: Jinan's Skill is Truly Extraordinary</p>
<p>The battle between Jinan and Guanghua took place yesterday in Guanghua's gymnasium. The strength of the two teams was clearly different. However, Jinan's Dian Nan Zhen was still sidelined with an ankle injury, watching from the bench. The participating members were Yin, Ye, Chen, Kuang, Cai, Yuan, Yang, and others, totaling seven people. The skills of the famous players Yin, Kuang, and Cai were naturally extraordinary. The points earned by Jinan, apart from Chunxiu's two points, were all controlled by these three pillars. In the first half, Guanghua was only able to obtain ten points, all from long-range shots. Opportunities under the basket were virtually nonexistent. The second half was even more dismal. Near the end, the Pan brothers and Zhou Hongyi scored a few goals to avoid a shutout. However, although Guanghua suffered a crushing defeat, they were still able to persevere to the end. Their sportsmanship is truly admirable. Referee: Qu Hongren.</p>
<p>A Resounding Victory: Guanghua Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>As the two armies clashed, Jinan's Cai Yanxiong scored the first point. Yin Guiren and Kuang YaoYa scored two more goals, and the scoreboard showed a score of 5 to 0. Guanghua's Pan Weichun scored two points with a long-range shot, finally getting on the board. Jinan continued to press forward, with Yin and Cai adding six more points. At this time, the situation gradually became dull. Guanghua's Zhou Hongyi scored on the sideline, offering a glimmer of hope. However, Guiren and Yanxiong continued to score with free throws, and the score difference gradually widened. Guanghua responded calmly, and the frontline soldiers were careful and cautious. The Pan brothers and the smiling tiger Shu Zhaoyi scored three goals in one go, and the break time had arrived. At this time, the score was 22 to 10. After the lemon break, Guanghua made major adjustments to its lineup, but the ball remained in Jinan's hands. Within five minutes, Cai, Yin, Kuang, Ye, and other generals scored as many as 18 points. Guanghua only scored two goals at this time, and the situation once again became dull. Jinan then added ten more points. Zhou Hongyi got an opportunity under the basket and lightly tossed the ball in. Soon after, Yin and Kuang scored, and Hongyi also scored a goal. The merciless whistle sounded loudly. The final result was 56 to 18. Guanghua suffered a crushing defeat. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>First half: Jinan 22, Guanghua 10. Second half: Jinan 34.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Points for Improvement in Guizhou Province's Education. The Ministry of Education Orders the Provincial Department of Education to Comply and Report. <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The report on the inspection of education in Guizhou Province by Chen Lijiang, a commissioner of the Ministry of Education, has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry. On the 19th, the Ministry specifically listed the points for improvement in the province's education and ordered the Provincial Department of Education to comply and report. The points are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Primary Education: The primary schools in the province are mostly poorly equipped, the teaching methods are outdated, and the management is very lax. The Department of Education should urgently dispatch inspectors to conduct a general inspection of the counties and order the educational administrative organs in each county to formulate plans for establishing primary schools and promoting them year by year as the basis for improvement. Model primary schools should be established and gradually increased year by year. In the 25th year, at least one school should be established in Zunyi and Anshun counties. The Department of Education should hold a workshop for primary school teachers during the summer vacation of the 25th year and order each county to send primary school principals, teachers, and county government officials in charge of primary education administration to attend the workshop to improve the quality of primary school teachers.</p>
<p>2. Regarding Compulsory Education: The six short-term primary schools established in the provincial capital have too few students and should be enrolled as soon as possible. Moreover, how the school's performance affects short-term primary schools throughout the province is crucial and should be supervised at any time. The expenses of the short-term primary schools in the province this year are fully allocated monthly by the Department. However, the expenses for compulsory education should be raised by the local government as a principle. For the next fiscal year, each county should be ordered to follow the "Outline of Provisional Measures for Raising Funds for Compulsory Education in Provinces, Counties, and Cities" promulgated by the central government to find ways to raise funds to facilitate the process. The majority of short-term primary schools in the province are established independently, and the teachers are full-time, and their qualifications and academic abilities are generally still in line. They should also be ordered to concurrently run rural and village public education to promote it.</p>
<p>3. Regarding Secondary and Normal Education: No secondary school may hold classes on Sundays. This must be strictly enforced. The arrangement of courses in the school's teaching schedule must also be rationalized. Do not accommodate the convenience of part-time teachers by scheduling several hours of a certain subject consecutively in one morning or afternoon, causing students to feel tired and reducing teaching efficiency. Natural science courses should have experimental teachers who should personally guide students to do hands-on work and have experimental reports. Equipment should be expanded, and a unified procurement method should be developed. Secondary and normal school teachers are excessively part-time. The ratio of part-time to full-time teachers should be in accordance with the revised secondary school regulations. More full-time teachers should be hired. The principals of each school should prepare a list of qualified personnel in accordance with the regulations and submit it to the Department of Education for approval, and then the principals should hire them. Absenteeism and tardiness of teachers and students should be strictly prohibited. The method should be formulated by the Department of Education and submitted to the Ministry for implementation. The provincial secondary schools in the province should determine their establishment based on the source of their funding. If there are provincial secondary schools in the province that are funded by the county, they should be renamed county secondary schools or still be called provincial secondary schools, and the funding should be paid by the provincial treasury. Most of the secondary school buildings are too dilapidated and should have a complete renovation and construction plan, which should be practical and easy to implement. The school buildings that have been borrowed by the military should be recovered for use as soon as possible. Students in secondary schools in the provincial capital often wander outside at night. Each secondary school should be strictly managed, and students must live on campus. If there are still cases of students being allowed to be undisciplined, the principal should be responsible. There are too few normal schools in the province and normal school districts should be designated and added year by year, with the goal of one school per district. County secondary schools should also be appropriately converted into simplified normal schools and rural normal schools or affiliated rural normal classes to train compulsory education teachers. The affiliated primary schools of the existing Guizhou Normal School and the Women's Normal School have very little contact with the normal school headquarters. The existing internship methods should be improved so that students can participate in the administrative management and teaching of the affiliated primary school in various ways for training.</p>
<p>4. Regarding Vocational Education: The proportion of vocational education funding should be in accordance with the ratio set by the Ministry, and a detailed plan for the future development of vocational education should be formulated based on the economic construction of the province. The Department of Education should consider the actual situation and order each county's secondary schools to be converted into junior vocational schools. The provincial junior vocational school is well-managed, but more internships should be provided, and cooperation with construction agencies should be established to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>You are expected to improve in accordance with the above points and promptly submit a report on the handling situation for future reference. This order.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 21st) The Ministry of Education modified Article 2 of the "Detailed Rules for the Collection of Works for the National Children's Painting Exhibition" to the effect that all public and private kindergartens, primary schools, and junior high schools that have been registered nationwide must select and submit works in accordance with these detailed rules for display and exhibition.

<h3 id="e171">Public Concession Chinese School Subsidies Increased and Approved. Concession Education Funding Reaches Maximum Limit <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Concession stated that foreign and Chinese private schools in the Public Concession apply to the Bureau of Public Works for subsidies each year in accordance with regulations. For this year's subsidy, the Foreign School Affairs Committee organized a subsidy review committee to make recommendations, stipulating a total of 169,000 yuan, of which schools run by the Japanese accounted for 128,000 yuan. Subsequently, the Japanese Residents Group in Shanghai petitioned for an additional subsidy of 66,000 yuan. This proposal was submitted to the Board of Directors by the School Affairs Committee for review. Later, the Finance Committee convened a meeting on the 17th of this month to discuss the results of the decision to recommend to the Board of Directors an additional 11,000 yuan in addition to the originally set 128,000 yuan (the same as last year). The Board of Directors, at its regular meeting on Sunday, approved the Finance Committee's recommendation to increase the subsidy to Japanese children's schools by 11,000 yuan.</p>
<p>As for Chinese private schools, the subsidies they should receive this year were also advocated by the Chinese School Subsidy Review Committee, from 200,876 yuan last year to 247,850 yuan, because 37 new Chinese children's schools were established by private individuals this year, with a total of 8,350 students, an increase of more than 23%. A corresponding economic subsidy is also proposed. Later, the Director of the Finance Department only agreed to consolidate the amount from last year's 200,800 yuan to an even 210,000 yuan, on the grounds that the financial situation this year is tight and all aspects need to be tightened. Fortunately, all departments of the Bureau of Public Works can appreciate this intention and have seen considerable results. However, the expenses of the Education Department in 1936 have increased compared to last year, because in addition to the subsidy, the internal expenses of this year have increased by 51,000 yuan compared to last year. The School Affairs Committee said that the application for subsidies for the 37 new Chinese schools has been deemed satisfactory, and the original amount of 247,000 yuan of the Review Committee should not be rejected again. After a discussion by the Finance Committee on the 17th of this month, with the consent of the Director of the Finance Department, it was agreed that an additional 19,000 yuan should be added on top of last year's subsidy limit, bringing the total to 227,160 yuan. A member of the Accounts Committee then reminded that the public concession education funding had previously been stipulated not to exceed 2% of the total donation and land price tax. Now the concession education funding, excluding the currently proposed increase of 11,000 yuan for Japanese children's schools and 19,000 yuan for Chinese school subsidies, has reached 1.84% of the total donation and property tax. If the proposed increase is added, it may reach 1.9%. After discussions among the members, it was agreed that the 1936 subsidy for Chinese private schools should be increased by 19,000 yuan, bringing the total to 227,760 yuan.</p>
<p>When the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Public Works discussed this matter on Wednesday, a member of the Board proposed that what should be made known is that the current concession education funding has reached the previously stipulated maximum amount (i.e., 2% of the total donation and land price tax). Therefore, all private schools in the future must not gradually increase due to the issuance of subsidies by the authorities. It must be known that those who receive financial assistance due to requests in the future must be allocated from the existing subsidies already received by each school. Therefore, the Chairman of the Board of Directors further suggested that the existing regulations should be reaffirmed now, that is, the public concession education funding, including all subsidies, must not exceed 2% of the total donation and land price tax. The above-mentioned increase in the number of subsidies was then passed.</p>

<p>— Zhang Feng</p>
<p>Old Mr. Wu Zhihui was a party friend who negotiated several times in Shanghai during the early years of the Republic. Since the 25th year, his teaching career has been a floating and sinking one. He eats at the east house and sleeps at the west house, and finally neither the east head nor the west head is attached. Who is more esteemed than the one who leisurely spends his years and soars in the central hub? Before and after the meeting, if I could let him know about this matter, he would not laugh and say that the world is in trouble, old friends are separated, and he knows that. He has a little friend who can recite Egyptian and Babylonian characters, but he cannot hear the stories of his hometown. I, Feng, do not pity myself, but Old Mr. Wu may think it is a pity. He will come to the school and visit the thatched cottage. At that time, I, Feng, will have a short untitled poem to discuss. The poem says, "The little gray grandson crawls on the ground in his clothes, begs the official to find ancient relics, and the principal catches the errand boy." Old Mr. Wu's humor is famous throughout the world. He can smile and ponder together, which is enough to bring joy for a moment and eliminate sorrow for all eternity. I will write again in a few days. March 10th, the 25th year, Zhang Feng respectfully bows. A summary of the investigation of ancient relics is attached.</p>
<p>Attached is a report and summary of Zhang Feng's personal investigation of the history and geography of Wu-Yue in the past two years. In each investigation, there are many disappointments.

According to the Jinshan ruins, the first discovery was an ancient well, which was mistakenly regarded as a defense against Japanese pirates at the time. Huang Bohui and his brothers paid attention to the pottery shards for the second time. This trip was the third visit. 8. Zhapu, October 11th, Xu Genwu, Cao Jun, Zhang Feng, discovered the ancient Haijian City, which was moved three times after the second year of Yongjian during the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty, and investigated the old Donggong Road. 9. Shangxi Temple, December, Zhang Renfu and Zhang Feng obtained five stone oxen. A former monk from Suzhou, Jiang Dayi, Cao Jian, and Zhang Feng identified pottery shards and red clay from the ruins of the old city and unearthed a beast tripod foot. This city was discovered by Jiang Cao and the other two gentlemen in previous investigations. 11. Wu Old City, January 8th, Wang Peizheng, Cao Jian, Jiang Dayi, Zhang Feng, inspected the Gaogang and the ruins of the abandoned base. 12. Zhang Shicheng City, February 18th, Jiang Dayi, Zhang Feng, the city is well preserved, and the old records are missing. According to Zhu Yizun's poetry, the new records are confirmed. 13. Jianchi Qianren Stone, same as above, same as above, checked as an ancient quarry. The inclination and angle of the Qianren Stone layers are consistent. Wu Wang's tomb should have been destroyed. The bamboo slips that flowed out in the Song Dynasty and the exposed tomb gate at the end of the Ming Dynasty should still be preserved and待查. 14. Gu Wu Cultural Layer, February 19th, Zhang Ziyi, Jiang Daqi, Zhang Feng drew a detailed map of a cultural layer in a pit more than three meters deep and gave it to Mr. Jiang for continued work. On the same day, I saw one of the old ten pottery pots unearthed in the old house, and two pottery pots unearthed a year earlier in Lengtan. 15. Three people holding a stone umbrella, January 20th, Jiang Dayi, Zhang Feng, climbed to the top of Tianping and confirmed that it was not an ancient relic, but a rocky road. Pottery shards have been seen, and the ruins of Guanwa can be explored. Another plan is being prepared and given to Jiang Cao and the other two gentlemen to continue the investigation. 16. Yuepu Seawall, February 13th, Zhang Shan, Zhang Feng, Jiang Dayi checked the objects of a certain country that had sunk, but did not get them, waiting for further investigation. 17.

Zhuji Xiaoshan, planned to live there for more than a month during the summer vacation to investigate. 20. Hypothetical shell mound, the address has been obtained, and it is indeed a shell mound. Objects must be accompanied by evidence to prove it, and one visit will be made to investigate. 21. Taibo City, etc. Taibo City is not necessarily in Wuxi, Qi Nu's tomb may not be a relic, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway broke through an ancient city. Zhengyi has a relic, all of which are planned to be confirmed as soon as possible. 22. Jiaocheng, is being designed for investigation. 23. The First Emperor's Post Road, the post road spans two provinces and passes through six or seven counties. It is discontinuous and incomplete, making it difficult to investigate. Even though it is near my hometown, there is no suitable method. 24. Hudu Fortress, this was noticed in 24 years, and has been investigated many times without success. (Note) Archaeological investigation is difficult and tedious, and learning has a teacher's method. The matter belongs to a specialty. It is difficult to say who started the picture. Authors in various countries attach importance to the time and date and the first discoverer as morality. I hope that writers, journalists, and propagandists will pay attention to the time and date of discovery and the names of the discoverers. The place names and purposes in the article are temporarily kept secret, please understand.</p>

<p>— Original by Lluisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"No, I think that little child you just mentioned, the elegant woman he married, was far more of a creator than the wild Nanen he met in his youth; or even more, the wise and virtuous mother-like woman often secretly protected him, like Little Mei protecting Little Qiao, was the most important to his success." Mrs. Shu, when speaking, looked back at her mother, who was sitting near Meg, and looked full of the gentle and virtuous dignity of old age. Mr. Lau gave her a filial glance and replied in a very sincere manner:</p>
<p>"All three of them were very helpful to him. Now I can understand that these girls must be very helpful to your children."</p>
<p>"But not more than the children helped them; it's mutual, I tell you. Ned helped Little Mei a lot with his music; Don manages Nanen better than any of us; Little Qiao teaches your golden curl children, effortlessly and with very satisfactory results, and Flitz even calls them Arzt and Junker. (Note 12) Ah! What a pity! If the men and women in the world could trust, understand, and help each other like my children, what a good place this world would be!" Mrs. Shu said, with a kind of trance in her eyes, as if she was seeing a wonderful new society, in which the people lived happily and innocently together, like a group of children in Mei Manor.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Finance: Major Investors Sell Heavily, Limiting Gold Price Increases <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Only a six-jiao fluctuation, resulting in only a one-jiao increase.  Only slightly over two thousand taels were traded.</p>
<p>The gold market continued to be sluggish yesterday, with only a six-jiao fluctuation throughout half the day, a sign of stability. However, because Tong Tai Chang sold gold bars heavily to profit from the high prices, buying interest was dampened, resulting in only a one-jiao increase. In the morning, news from overseas silver markets indicated that the British market was rising and the American market was stable.  Floor traders stated that after the market closed, a few Indian buyers bought at the listed price and there were buyers around 0.0625 below that. Mondel's forward silver price remained unchanged, or rose by varying amounts up to 3.5%. Exchange rates rose slightly. London's raw gold fell by one penny.

However, the market opening was slightly delayed as it awaited the Central Bank's listed price. After opening, the market turned from weak to stable. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) posted its rates, with both the British and American rates unchanged. At this point, the market hovered. Although there was a slight increase later, it was difficult to sustain because major investors sold aggressively to profit from the high prices, and banks also offered a little. The silver equalization tax was announced, rising by 75. People's minds were at ease. Although there was buying activity, Tong Tai Chang constantly supplied bars, turning from a long to a short position. Consequently, the market momentum was blocked, and in the end, there was no change of even one jiao. Swap rates were slightly higher. Yesterday, the long position posted 4.90 yuan. The market conditions for the first half of the day are recorded below.</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at 1148.20 yuan, a decrease of 20 jiao from the previous close, then rose to 1148.10 yuan.

<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, fell to 1145.90 yuan. Compared to the closing price, this was about 3 yuan less than the slightly higher April ledger price of 1144 yuan, and the May price of 1149 yuan. The supplementary water was 1144 yuan in the morning. The price of pure gold, after adding 3 yuan, was 1151.20 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods, after adding 7.5 yuan, lacked buyers.  Spot trading of pure gold saw transactions after adding 7.6 yuan. The major player Heng bought 50 taels at the time. The spot price swap from today to May saw Heng pay Da Chang Xiang 7 taels, for 7 yuan. The April to May swap saw Yuan Mao Yong, the long position, pay Da De Cheng 7 taels, for 4.7 yuan. Fu Xing Yong paid Tong Feng Heng 5.9 yuan.</p>
<p>There wasn't much trading on the floor. In summary, Heng Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, and Qia Feng Yong were primarily on the buying side.

<p>Since the promulgation and implementation of the Subsidiary Currency Ordinance on January 11, the Ministry of Finance has been engaged in minting. The prototype coins were submitted to the government and the Executive Yuan for record on February 5. On February 6, Proclamation No. 134 stipulated the issuance on February 10.  Initially, the currency was not often seen on the market, but recently it has been seen in stores for change.  However, it is still not enough to meet demand, and counterfeits have been discovered, causing users to be wary.  Recently, several cases have been cracked, which should reduce such activity.

<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange remained lifeless.  There were occasional movements on both the buy and sell sides, but they quickly returned to stillness.  Price fluctuations continued to occur within a very narrow range. Although large players reached out on both sides, sellers were unwilling to lower prices, and buyers were unwilling to increase them.  As soon as buying interest rose slightly, all holders immediately sold; as soon as selling interest rose slightly, all holders immediately bought. It seemed as though the market price was only allowed to fluctuate within two or three jiao, and that there was no longer any hope for larger increases or decreases. Most of the trading was still done by small retail buyers. The financial sector was unwilling to pay attention, and speculators had no way to intervene. The more it was ignored, the more rigid it became; the more rigid it became, the fewer transactions there were. Yesterday, only the 35 issue was in slightly higher demand, but even it was not willing to raise prices. Those inclined to sell were everywhere, as even a rise of one or two jiao felt difficult to achieve. However, sellers were determined to push prices up and were unwilling to budge easily. Therefore, various first board issues were better by 0.05 to 0.25, but the March issues of classes A and B seemed to be slightly weaker by 0.05 to 0.20 due to hedging. The final board was very calm. Only class E was slightly better by 0.05 because the 35 issue continued to be bought in tens of thousands. The rest of the issues each had one bid, and the market price did not fluctuate. Class D was still unable to open during both boards. When the market opened in the afternoon, class D rose sharply by 0.55 compared to the previous price because six boards had not been traded. Half of the remaining issues were slightly better by 0.10 or so, and half were completely unchanged. At closing, the 35 issue was still in slightly higher demand, and various issues rebounded by 0.10 or 0.15. On the whole, it still did not escape the sideways trend. As a result, April issues rebounded across the board by 0.15 to 0.55. The March class B issue was still weaker by 0.20, and the class A issue was also weaker by 0.05. The total trading volume was still only 1,575,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning but fell in the afternoon, and the situation turned downward. A weak market price triggered some long positions to liquidate. At the same time, spot yarn trading became quiet as factories did not supply spot goods. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the spot yarn prices in Qingdao and Guangdong had fallen by 3-4 yuan. As a result, sellers took the opportunity to act, and the market price declined.</p>
<p>Speculative Yarn Falls Back in the Afternoon. During the opening of the speculative yarn market this morning, prices of each month continued to rise.

At a price of 11.42-11.38, four cotton distributors released 10,000 bales. This high price was due to industry insiders, hollow merchants to remedy their positions, and foreign businesses' demand. It is said that the May and June markets are doing better since the March market has dissolved. It also seemed that the weather in the West was dry. Hasted estimated the current week's factory usage at 274,000 bales, and Liverpool's reserve was at 361,000 bales. The market closing was steady.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, presented a state of initial stability and then flatness for each month. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago and Canada, continued to decline by a small two jiao, but the market sentiment, due to the sluggish sales of sellers, caused industry participants to mostly take a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, the opening price had seen a slight improvement of about 0.075 jiao, but later, due to good weather and less activity from customers, the market sentiment gradually flattened. By the afternoon opening, trading was still active, but the price remained unchanged. Because in terms of weather, it should be weak, but there are many changes in the environment, and it cannot be overly suppressed, so it is expected that there will be a circling pattern in the future.</p>

Forced to open in the afternoon, June continued to soften, and July and August were already stable. According to the industry participants' speculation, the new wheat market, from now until Qingming, we can understand if it is a bumper harvest or not. Therefore, there should be fewer huge ups and downs recently. The spot wheat market remains stable, with Shandong Linhuai Pass wheat opening at 5.28 yuan, Xianghe wheat at 4.99 yuan, and settlement goods at 0.97 yuan, bought by Fuxin with about 100 bales.</p>

<p>Pingshui green tea from Zhejiang Province has long relied on the United States as its primary market. In recent years, due to the impact of competition from Japanese tea, the number of Pingshui tea shipments to the United States has decreased from one hundred thousand boxes to eighty thousand boxes. Recently, news from New York indicates that the U.S. government, due to the uneven grades and impure quality of Pingshui Dabang green tea, is considering confiscating inferior-quality Chinese tea that does not meet beverage standards. However, American tea merchants still hold differing opinions on this matter. Nevertheless, if Chinese tea does not promptly seek improvements in its trade with the U.S., its future is quite concerning.</p>

Lower-grade, inexpensive woolen suit pieces were particularly sought after. Buyers, aiming to cater to customer preferences, extensively searched for such items.

<p>— Xiong Peizhu, Jiangdu County Dongcheng Elementary School</p>
<p>I am an elementary school student. My living environment consists of a beautiful school and a kind family. My companions are mostly children, who spend their days playing and laughing. We have never thought about our future. On the National Day of the 24th year, the principal said, "Children! You are still young and only know how to play all day. This is certainly a lively and innocent behavior. Not just you, all the children in the world are like this. But you must remember that our motherland is not the strong England or the wealthy America. Our motherland is a weak and endangered China. Therefore, your responsibility is very great. Remember! The revival of China depends on you children!..." I was moved by these words. Alas! "Our motherland is a weak and endangered country." How should I strive? What kind of person should I emulate in the future? Undoubtedly, I am willing to dedicate my life to working hard and fighting for our motherland, driving away our enemies, developing our country, and reviving our nation, becoming a patriot who sacrifices for the country.</p>

<p>— Junming</p>
<p>Newton was born on December 25, 1642. He was a scientist. In 1667, he invented the prism. He also invented the reflecting telescope. He died in 1727 at the age of eighty-five. His childhood was very interesting.</p>
<p>Because he lost his parents at a young age, he lived with his uncle. Although he was an orphan, he approached everything with the attitude of "Why is it like this? What exactly is it like that?" This had a great influence on his later inventions.</p>
<p>One day, he was taking a walk alone in the garden and saw an apple falling from an apple tree to the ground. You might think this is a small and ordinary thing, nothing strange. However, this young scientist Newton, strangely enough, refused to let it go easily. He thought to himself, "Why doesn't the apple fall upwards or sideways? Why does it fall vertically?" Finally, he discovered what is known as the "law of gravity," which attracts all things. Children! You must pay attention. Scientific inventors discover principles from very ordinary things that others do not notice. It lies in paying attention to everything.</p>
<p>Another anecdote: one morning, he was in the midst of his research when a servant brought eggs and a pot to cook breakfast. Newton said, "Just put the eggs and the pot here. I'll cook them myself." Later, he went to cook them himself. After waiting for tens of minutes, the water in the pot was boiling. He thought the eggs were cooked, but when he opened it, it wasn't eggs, but a watch rolling in the boiling water. Imagine how focused he was! Truly, he was single-minded!</p>

<p>— Shayou</p>
<p>—Although we don't have it yet, we should still know—</p>
<p>The Zeppelin factory in Germany recently built a large airship, preparing to fly regularly across the Atlantic. The equipment of that airship is simply like an "air hotel."</p>
<p>This airship is divided into two levels. The lower level contains twenty-five rooms and can carry fifty passengers. Each room has two berths, hot and cold running water pipes, a wardrobe for hanging clothes, and a writing desk. In addition, there is a dining hall with a capacity of thirty guests. The upper level is a smoking room, a bathroom, a washroom, a kitchen, a crew rest room, and a storage room.</p>
<p>This airship will start scheduled flights this spring, with each voyage taking two days and the fare being four hundred gold dollars per passenger.</p>
<p>With the aviation industry developing so rapidly, and with such comfortable and convenient travel, I'm afraid that in less than fifty years, ships and trains will be relegated to specialized cargo transport, while passenger travel will be entirely carried out by airships or airplanes.</p>
<p>Children! Backward nations are retreating to the mountains and forests, living the primitive life of the Wu Huai and Ge Tian clans; civilized nations are rising from the land and sea, riding clouds and mist, and living the life of immortals in the sky. We are now being forced to go into the mountains or hell. How can we not strive and advance?</p>
<p>What a great Berlin airship!</p>

<h3 id="e201">Owl <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>Because of its appearance and nature, the owl is disliked and regarded as a symbol of danger; in the West, the owl is known as a philosopher and conspirator. Indeed, its appearance is indeed different from ordinary birds: a large head, large eyes, a small face, a sharp hooked beak, and two tufts of hair on its head, resembling a pair of ears (but those are not ears). The upper half of its head, from the hairline to the eyes, does look a bit like a cat's head. We call it a "cat-headed owl," which is a pictorial name. In the dictionary, its original name is "xiao" (owl). (Figure A)</p>
<p>Its only special characteristic is that it sleeps during the day and comes out at night, preying on small birds and other animals in the dark. Sometimes, in the still of the night, we hear a "ju li ju li" sound flying past in the air. Many timid people mistake it for a ghost's cry, but it is actually the old gentleman owl on patrol. It takes advantage of the fact that small animals are sound asleep to suddenly attack and hunt them to feed its belly.</p>
<p>You might ask: How can it see in the dark? That is why it has a pair of large eyes. It can not only see, but also see things from high up and far away that we cannot see. Although its eyes have similarities with cat eyes, there are also differences. The similarity is that both can see things in very dark places, and their pupils can enlarge or shrink very flexibly. The difference is that when a cat's pupil shrinks, it goes from a vertical olive shape to a very thin vertical line (Figure C—), while an owl's pupil remains round when it shrinks (Figure C). When it looks at dark places, its pupil enlarges greatly, almost the size of the entire eyeball (Figure B). However, when it encounters strong light, it shrinks smaller than a match head. The structure and function of its pupil are the same as the aperture of a camera lens: when the camera lens needs to take pictures in a dark place, the aperture must be enlarged; when taking pictures of brightly lit scenes, the aperture must be reduced. This is how the amount of light received is adjusted. The pupil function of cats and owls works exactly the same way. Human pupils also have the same function, but their efficiency and flexibility are far inferior to theirs.</p>
<p>In addition to small birds, owls also eat mice and even snails. Its feathers are different from other birds in that they are light and soft, so it doesn't make flapping sounds when it flies. Moreover, its structure is special and won't make noise when the wind blows. Otherwise, the small animals it wants to catch will hear it and hide.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhao Feng Park Zoo recently has a live owl in a corner of the bird house. If children have the opportunity, they can go and observe it and compare it with what is described in this article.</p>

<p>— Zhou Qifeng</p>
<p>When we travel to major cities like Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Qingdao, what we see is wide and flat roads, neat and sturdy buildings, and bustling traffic. Everything tries its best to express the civilization of modern material. But these are all achievements managed by foreigners in the concessions. Once outside the concessions, there is a sense of inferiority, which makes you wonder if it is another world. Only Guangzhou is a prosperous city built entirely by the power of the Chinese people. The density of population, the prosperity of industry and commerce, and the perfection of municipal facilities are no less than those of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou and other places. If we don't think it is glorious to rely on foreigners, then the number one city in China should be given to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>However, the prosperity and glory of Guangzhou is not only due to human efforts. Natural forces and the geographical environment are also enough to make Guangzhou prosperous. Guangzhou is located in the delta of the Pearl River, a very fertile alluvial plain. It is also located at the estuary of the West, North, and East Rivers, and is the starting point of the Yuehan, Guangjiu, and Chegguang three railways. If there were no obstacles from Hong Kong, the future of Guangzhou would be truly limitless.</p>
<p>Guangzhou is the birthplace of the revolution. The Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang and the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall stand majestic and inspire awe. Remembering the firm and outstanding fighting spirit of the martyrs, and looking at the current national situation, one cannot help but feel emotional!</p>

<p>— Baitao</p>
<p>The things surrounding us are truly mysterious! Machines working in place of people; generators producing electricity; trains speeding; airplanes flying; radio transmitting sound and images; miners extracting gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, coal, etc. from mines; printers printing thousands of books, newspapers, and various colored drawings. Looking again at the fields, we see that grains can grow and bear fruit; a single seed can grow into a large tree; various insects are born and die; and there are fish, birds, flowers, and plants; the sky rains and thunders; the sun, moon, and stars move; and the four seasons change continuously. Truly, there is nothing that is not strange, and there is no end to what can be said. All these mysterious things surrounding us have an attraction, attracting us to study them. Because they are mysterious and interesting, many scientists are moved by curiosity and pursue them year after year.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to understand these mysterious things. We only need to put in the effort to study them. Here, I will continue to write about these mysterious scientific knowledge in a systematic way, paying special attention to small experiments. After you have done these experiments, you will slowly step into the door of science.</p>
<p>The First Mysterious Thing</p>
<p>Many things are not always the same as their appearance; when we see them and find them strange, we should examine them carefully. For example, we cannot turn a piece of iron into something else. But if you immerse a shiny knife or a bright iron piece in a certain blue liquid, take it out and see that it has suddenly turned into copper. How strange is that! Originally, that blue liquid is copper sulfate dissolved in water, and copper sulfate is made by dissolving copper in sulfuric acid. So, that blue liquid contains copper. Strange! The steel knife has turned into copper! Is that really the case? But you can't see it. When you immerse the iron, some copper precipitates on it, so when you take it out, a layer of shiny copper is plated on the iron surface, as if it has turned into copper. In the past, people plated silver objects with a layer of gold and said that the object was gold. In practice, a piece of silver is immersed in an acid, the silver is dissolved, and then a layer of gold is plated on it. This tells us a simple rule, that is, one metal cannot be turned into another metal.</p>
<p>Many things surrounding us prevent us from seeing their true colors; just like in blue copper sulfate, we cannot see the copper. For example, children in the city often see people using gas to light lamps or cook. This kind of gas lamp conceals coal. You can do a small experiment: if you put some coal in a large pipe (such as the long pipe used by rural people to smoke moist tobacco), and put the pipe on an alcohol lamp or stove to heat. If you cover the top of the pipe tightly and only let the air out of the tube, gas will be released from the coal immediately, and it will start to flow out from the top of the tube. Strike a match and you can burn the gas. Where does this gas come from, and why is it flammable? Originally, strange! The smoke at the top of the pipe is burning! The gas conceals flammable coal. Another strange thing is the black, gelatinous substance left in the pipe, which we call coal tar, and can also be made into beautiful dyes.</p>
<p>The lead used to make airplanes, airships, and other things is hidden in ordinary soil! Many things in the world are not always the same as their appearance, which is very mysterious. (This article has three illustrations, which will be published in the next issue.)</p>

<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>There are no boundaries between children, so children are all friends who don't need introductions.</p>
<p>Within the family: brothers and sisters are the closest friends, not only because they spend a lot of time together, but also because of the bond of siblings.</p>
<p>Within the school: male and female classmates study together, exercise and play together, which is a mutual aid friendship.</p>
<p>Within the society: poor and wealthy children love each other, and there is no discrimination, which can be said to be an equal friendship.</p>
<p>Within the world: regardless of black, white, yellow, or red races, adults may be calculating the boundaries of races and creating racial wars, but children only know the friendship of the same year and do not know the differences of races; this can be said to be a natural friendship.</p>
<p>There is no money or power between children... these things hinder true friendship or create false friendship, so children's friendship is the purest and greatest.</p>

<p>— Wen Ying, a third-grade female student at Wanzhu Elementary School</p>
<p>I am a twelve-year-old elementary school student. When I was seven years old, my mother sent me to a rural school to study. At that time, I only read books like "People, hands, bamboo, knives, rulers" and "Older brother, younger brother, younger sister". After studying for about two years, in May of the year I was nine years old, my family moved to Shanghai to live, and spent a summer vacation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of July, when the schools recruited students for the autumn semester, my father registered me at Wanzhu Elementary School. The next day, he took me to the school to take the entrance exam. At that time, I had just arrived in Shanghai and was very timid. In addition, the schools in Shanghai were very different from those in the countryside. There were many students in the Shanghai schools. When I took the entrance exam, I was so scared that I almost died. As a result, I was not accepted.</p>
<p>At this time, I had no choice but to stay at home and not study. I thought that studying in Shanghai was really not easy, so I might as well go back to the countryside to study. When I was feeling discouraged, Bing Ge, the landlord downstairs, came upstairs and saw that I looked unhappy. He asked me why I was unhappy, and I told him about not passing the entrance exam. Bing Ge quickly said to me, "In our era of children's drawings, no matter what we do! If we don't succeed, we shouldn't be discouraged, but should strive to improve." He also said, "Failure is the mother of success. We must not be discouraged if we fail in one step." After listening to Bing Ge's advice, I reviewed my old books at home for the past six months. When I encountered words or sentences that I didn't know or couldn't explain, I asked my father. In this way, when I was ten years old, I took the entrance exam again in the spring and passed. I was very happy in my heart. Recalling Bing Ge's words, they were really correct. We children should not be discouraged. I have been studying until this year and have been promoted to the A group of the intermediate group. Now I am writing down my own experience, hoping that children all over the country, no matter what they do, if they encounter failure, they must strive and fight, "Don't be discouraged" is the key.</p>

<p>— Xinqing</p>
<p>Little Aloys was indeed one of the richest children in the village. She had neither brothers nor sisters; her blue velvet dress never had holes in it. When she first participated in Holy Communion, she wore a gorgeous Mechlin lace bonnet on her soft hair, which her grandmother and mother had worn when they were young. Although she was only twelve years old, half of the men in the village already paid attention to her, thinking that she would be a good wife for their sons in the future. But little Aloys was a naive and innocent girl who didn't know her own background. The little friend she loved the most and often played with was little Nanlos and his dog.</p>
<p>Her father, Mr. Coghans, was also a very kind man, but he was a bit too serious. One day, he went to the meadow behind the kitchen and ran into the three of them together.</p>
<p>His little daughter Aloys was sitting in the middle of a pile of hay, and Birdy's tan head was resting on her body. They were surrounded by wreaths of poppies and blue cornflowers; and the child Nanlos was taking a burnt branch and drawing them both on a smooth pine board as realistically as possible.</p>
<p>The miller looked at the portrait, and tears unconsciously welled up in his eyes, because the face in the portrait looked very similar to little Aloys, and he loved his daughter very much. Immediately, he reprimanded little Aloys and pretended that her mother was calling her. Little Aloys was very scared and ran into the house crying. Mr. Coghans turned around, took the pine board from little Nanlos's hand, and said with a trembling body, "Why are you doing such a mindless thing?" Little Nanlos blushed, lowered his head, and replied softly, "I like to draw whatever I see."</p>
<p>Mr. Coghans was silent for a while, then took a franc in his hand, stretched it out, and said to little Nanlos, "I said this is a mindless thing, a waste of time; but you draw little Aloys so vividly that her mother will definitely like it. Take this silver coin and give me this painting."</p>
<p>The blush on little Nanlos's face faded away. He raised his head, put his hands behind his back, and said quietly, "Mr. Coghans, please keep the money and the painting. You want to treat me very well." Then he called Birdy over, and together they crossed the field and went home. As he walked, he murmured to Birdy, "Although he gave me the franc, I must not accept it, because I am unwilling to sell her portrait."</p>

<h3 id="e208">Germany's Advance into the Rhineland and the European Situation <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhen</p>
<p>The result of World War I's sacrifice of countless lives and property was the Treaty of Versailles, a contract of servitude for the German people. Through Germany's relentless struggles over more than a decade, this treaty has been gradually torn apart. Initially, reparations were reduced to complete cessation of payments. Subsequently, with Hitler's rise to power, he unilaterally declared rearmament. The Saar region was reclaimed through a plebiscite. Most recently, troops were directly sent to occupy the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, thoroughly destroying the Treaty of Versailles. Most of the Treaty of Versailles has been torn up. Under the circumstances of Germany's free action on its territory and denial of its obligations, it can be said to be completely equivalent to waste paper. At present, the only shackles imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles that have not yet been removed are the former territories in Eastern Europe ceded to Poland and other countries that have not been restored, and the overseas colonies ceded and transferred to the victorious nations that have not been recovered. However, all these are no longer a question of whether Germany will continue to abide by the treaty obligations of the Treaty of Versailles, but only a question of whether its actual power can fulfill its aspirations. In fact, there is no need to talk about the binding force of international treaties.</p>
<p>The demilitarized zone of the Rhineland was stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that "Germany shall not maintain or construct any fortifications" and "shall not station any troops in this area, nor prepare for mobilization in this area." After the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, countries such as Britain and France stationed troops here in order to monitor and force Germany to fulfill the treaty and extract reparations. Later, the withdrawal of British and French troops from the Rhineland was not because they felt Germany could not bear this oppression, which caused social poverty and unrest, and there was a great possibility of this triggering a revolution. Therefore, these two imperialist countries allowed the reduction of reparations and the withdrawal of troops from the Rhineland. Of course, there was also the role of Britain already intending to gradually restore German power to prevent France from becoming too powerful and Russia from advancing westward. But at this time, the so-called Locarno Treaty was also established, in which Germany's obligations in the Rhineland region were reiterated, and another iron chain was tied to Germany. It was also stipulated that if Germany violated the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaty, all countries should take joint action to assist each other. The so-called mutual assistance was, in fact, mainly to prevent Germany from restoring its armed forces in the Rhineland area and 　　 France, in order to guarantee France's security.</p>
<p>But what about now? Since Germany automatically announced its rearmament and thus had considerable strength, it completely mobilized a large army and marched into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland on the 7th and 8th of this month without adopting a negotiating attitude. According to the existing number of German troops, there are already 60,000 troops in the area. The soaring of German planes, the installation of artillery and anti-aircraft guns, and the reconstruction of artillery emplacements along the borders of neighboring France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, etc., are gradually intensifying the implementation of its own plans, regardless of any protests or criticisms. Because of this, France is also actively deploying troops and busily strengthening its border defenses. Moreover, Germany is taking a threatening posture in the unfolding of this tense situation, indicating that if anyone wants to enforce treaty rights to interfere with its free actions, it will not hesitate to resort to bloody warfare. Therefore, the attention of the whole world has once again focused on this event. Everyone recognizes that it is bigger and more tense than the storms stirred up between European imperialist countries by the Italo-Ethiopian War, and there is a great sense that war is imminent. Because no matter how serious the Italo-Ethiopian War is, it is still limited to the struggle for colonies in Africa, while Germany's rearmament of the Rhineland is an expansion of direct conflict within European imperialism, igniting the fuse for the explosion of the powder keg on the European continent.</p>
<p>Judging from Germany's rearmament in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland this time, although it seems superficially tense, it may not immediately lead to war. Even the final outcome of this event may very well lead to the shifting of the tense atmosphere in Western Europe to Eastern Europe in the future. Because Hitler's dispatch of troops into the Rhineland area and the declaration of not complying with the obligations of the Locarno Treaty are under the pretext of opposing the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact. He believes that the Franco-Soviet Pact is a military alliance and hostile act of encirclement against Germany, and therefore Germany has no obligation to abide by the Locarno Pact. Of course, this claim by Germany is just an excuse, a smokescreen. Its true intention is to complete its absolute freedom to restore its military deployment within the former German territory under this pretext, and to abolish any treaty constraints imposed on it by the victorious countries. Because, in fact, the essence of the Franco-Soviet Pact can only be said to be defensive rather than offensive for both France and the Soviet Union. Neither France nor the Soviet Union has any territorial ambitions or possibility of aggression against Germany. Therefore, as long as Germany does not further threaten France and the Soviet Union, and France and the Soviet Union jointly take any military action against Germany 　 make sure there is absolutely no 　 actual situation. Germany is not unaware of this. However, Germany knows this, but still uses the Franco-Soviet Pact as an excuse, directly sending troops into the Rhineland regardless of treaties. There is a deep meaning in this.</p>
<p>When we analyze Germany's actions, we should understand that the reason is not limited to restoring the armament on the Rhine, but also to weaken the constraints and pressure imposed on its Eastern European policy by the Franco-Soviet Pact. The fact is very clear. Everyone knows that the existing state of absolute opposition between France and Germany makes it impossible for them to think of any territorial ambitions towards each other. Therefore, in Western Europe, Germany's ambition is at most to demand the restoration of the Rhineland's state of military readiness, so that it becomes Germany's completely sovereign and free territory. However, France is reluctant to grant even this small favor, which has created irreconcilable contradictions between the two countries. In Germany, because the recovery of overseas colonies and the lost territories ceded to Poland and other countries are the objects of imperialist development, it is bound to choose Russia. However, France, fearing Germany's rise, restricts its development with the Franco-Soviet Pact. This makes Germany deeply grieved and unable to avoid resolutely eliminating the root of the contradiction in Western Europe in order to facilitate its Eastern European policy. Therefore, on the one hand, it resolutely completes the necessary desire for its imperialist survival, cancels the constraints imposed on it in the Rhineland area by the treaty, and on the other hand, it attempts to reduce the conflicting factors of the incessant disputes between France and Germany, so as to further establish a relative coordination with France and achieve the effect of undermining the Franco-Soviet Pact. We only need to look at Germany's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty between various capitalist countries immediately after the restoration of armament in the Rhineland, including Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, etc., but excluding Russia, and the proposal to revise the Locarno Treaty and the Western European Air Pact, in order to remove France's unease and suspicion, etc., to understand.</p>
<p>Of course, France is still unwilling to accept Germany's demands because of the fear of the future dangers of Germany's rise. Therefore, the issue of Germany's rearmament in the Rhineland has immediately caused a serious situation between Germany and France. But in fact, France will eventually succumb, and even be forced to coordinate with Germany to reduce its burden on the Franco-Soviet Pact. Because Germany not only threatens it with war, making it dare not refuse to yield without the assistance of Britain and Italy; but also because of the contradictions between Britain and Italy, even if Britain is afraid that Germany will come out to support Italy, it has to hold Germany back. Also, because Britain has always been willing to prop up Germany to prevent Russia, it must buy off Germany. Therefore, Britain has always secretly supported Germany's proposal for a Western European Air Pact, wanting to remove the opposition between France and Germany in Western Europe. Therefore, Britain this time will not only not actively oppose Germany's breach of contract in rearming the Rhineland, but even mediate, exerting pressure on France to gradually accept Germany's proposals for the revision of the Locarno Pact, the creation of the Western European Air Pact, and the establishment of a non-aggression treaty. As for Italy, it is now most concerned about the scramble for African colonies. It can only take advantage of the tense atmosphere of the Rhineland issue to coerce for its own interests, and it will not benefit France's position. This has been proven by its current expression of indifference and neutrality. Thus　France will be isolated and helpless on the Rhineland issue, and will not dare to independently use force to punish Germany's breach of contract, and will eventually only gradually soften, compromise, and succumb. If the development of this fact reaches the realization of Germany's proposal, that is, it is realized under the mediation and support of Britain, and even pressure on France, then the tense atmosphere caused by the restoration of the Rhineland, if it does not accidentally trigger a war here, will be transferred to Eastern Europe. This is the possible future of its development.</p>

<p>— Ermike Tu</p>
<p>Suiyuan Baotou Correspondence</p>
<p>Suiyuan is a sparsely populated place. Its area is the largest among the current so-called five provinces of North China, but the population distribution averages only two people per square mile. The land is very barren, and compared with the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the interior, it can simply be called a barren land. Therefore, it has never attracted people's attention. Since the fall of the four northeastern provinces and the issue of Inner Mongolia's autonomy centered on Baiyemiao, this line has aroused deep attention from the Chinese people. Recently, due to political, military, and diplomatic relations, its status has become very important. Therefore, the number of people traveling and surveying here every year is endless, traveling back and forth on the Ping-Sui</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>road.</p>
<p>Because this place is close to desert areas in the north, southwest, the climate changes very drastically between hot and cold. In winter, it is of course very cold, and even in summer, it is often hot during the day and cold at night. Therefore, ordinary plants do not grow easily. The general production situation is also very backward. Most of the land is grassland that has not yet been cultivated, and only a small part is engaged in agriculture. The main production of the general public is to operate livestock using grasslands. In the livestock industry, the production of cattle and sheep is of course the main source, but horses also occupy a very important position. Therefore, the horses of Suiyuan are famous throughout the country.</p>
<p>Although most modern means of transportation are centered on machinery, in backward China, horses still occupy a very important position in transportation and farming. Especially in military affairs, its use is even more important. In order to encourage horse production and breed improvement, the Suiyuan provincial authorities hold a horse production competition every year to show their promotion. At each session, the counties of Suiyuan Province and the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia enthusiastically participate, which forms a grand gathering of the Han and Mongolian ethnic groups once a year.</p>
<p>The horse production competition is held by the provincial government on the Double Ten Festival every year. The participating units, the counties and leagues and banners, first hold preliminary competitions within each unit to select the "horse selection line," and then gather in the provincial capital to participate in the competition. The competition venue is the Guihua County sports field in the Suiyuan provincial capital. Guihua County is divided into two cities, new and old, facing each other east and west, about five or six miles apart. This large sports field is in the middle of the two cities. Because of the climate, there are very few trees here, so this sports field is just a flat and huge wasteland. Few people usually come to this place to exercise, because besides the two grandstands built for horse racing and the simple horse racing track, there are no other facilities. However, the few days before and after the Double Ten Festival are different. Red men and green women, all the people in the city, gather here to watch this grand competition once a year. This is certainly because the people outside the Great Wall are particularly interested in horse racing, which is closely related to them, and there are few such opportunities to gather usually, which is also the main reason.</p>
<p>During the competition, local residents and Mongolians from various leagues and banners gather around the sports field, some riding horses, some taking cars, and some walking. In addition to the Han people, there are Manchus who speak fluent "Mandarin," Mongolians who drag their braids and wear purple robes, and what attracts the most attention are the Mongolian princes and noble women in Qing robes and jackets with pearl ornaments. This horse race has also become a human race exhibition at the same time.</p>
<p>The competition lasts for three days. If the weather is bad or the competition is not finished, it can be extended for a few days. Generally, the first two days are preliminary rounds, and the last day is the finals. There are different types of horses, generally divided into three types: running horses, trotting horses, and breeding horses. Running horses and trotting horses are trained to run or trot according to their nature from an early age. Breeding horses are young horses that have not yet matured. Competitions are also held separately according to these three categories.</p>
<p>The method of competition is to divide the various types of horses into groups and hold them individually. The starter and judges direct and evaluate. The distance for running horses and trotting horses is different. The distance for running horses is two li, while the distance for trotting horses is only one li. The time used for these two distances is generally between two minutes and fifteen seconds and two minutes and twenty-five seconds, and rarely exceeds two minutes and twenty-five seconds. However, this speed is considered quite impressive.</p>
<p>After the competition is over, prizes are awarded according to the rankings. Silver shields, winning flags, etc., are certainly included in the prizes, but most of them are saddles, stirrups, and the like. Sometimes the local authorities also give bonuses to the horse that runs first, or bestow excellent names such as "Sui Feng" [Sui Wind] or "Chi Dian" [Lightning].</p>
<p>Being good at riding horses is very common in nomadic life. Not only is this true for adults, but children are also very good at it. In one of the horse production competitions, one of the riders who won first place in the running horse race was only twelve or thirteen years old. Among us Mongolians, riding horses is even more common, and has almost become a daily necessity. Not to mention adults, it is also common for young men and women around fifteen years old to graze horses on one side of the grassland and chase each other while riding horses on the other side. They usually ride horses without saddles and reins, and they are also untrained wild horses. Often the boys ride horses and gallop past, and the girls grab the horse , turn around, mount the horse and chase after them. A natural picture is formed on the vast grassland.</p>
<p>In addition to being used for local transportation and farming, most of the horses produced here are sold to various armies in the country. Many people come here to purchase them every year. There are many horse shops in Guihua and Baotou. After the purchasers arrive here, there will be "horse dealers" to solicit business. All food and lodging are provided by the horse shop, and they will transport horses from all over the place for you to choose from.</p>
<p>There is no fixed price for horses. Ordinary untrained so-called wild horses are generally about forty or fifty yuan per horse. If they are trained and very good, the price is hard to say, ranging from several hundred to thousands of yuan. For example, "Sui Feng," which won first place in the running horse race at a certain horse race, was bought for a price of one thousand yuan. However, these horses are mostly noticed by wealthy people who love horses, and ordinary customers rarely inquire about them.</p>
<p>It also takes capital to graze horses here. In the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, it is of course possible to "graze green" on the grasslands, but in winter, it is necessary to purchase fodder to feed them. And the "Ba Tou" who manages the horse herd and the "horse master" who trains the horses must also be specialized talents, and their wages are also very considerable.</p>
<p>The scenery outside the Great Wall is fundamentally different from that in the interior. When the peach blossoms are red, the willows are green, and the birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant elsewhere, here the green grass is everywhere and the cattle and sheep are in flocks. The herdsmen hold long whips in their hands, perched high on horseback, shouting various calls to command the livestock herds. Coupled with the unique northerly wind outside the Great Wall and the distant bald mountains, a majestic picture is drawn! No wonder the poem "When the wind blows the grass low, the cattle and sheep appear" has become a famous line in history describing the scenery outside the Great Wall.</p>

<p>— Lao Pu</p>
<p>Zhuoxian, Shanxi Correspondence</p>
<p>Zhuoxian County is famous for producing "cauterized dates." The so-called "cauterized dates" are baked with fire, crispy, sweet, and extremely delicious; they are sold in this province and North China, amounting to no less than several million yuan each year. About four thousand poor people in Zhuoxian County rely on this to make a living. Last year, the date harvest was abundant and sales were also strong, so most of those engaged in cauterized dates tripled their profits. The places where cauterized dates are made are commonly known as workshops; as long as you see various patterned signs made of hollow cauterized dates hanging at the entrance, it is a workshop for making cauterized dates. There are three hundred and several dozen of these workshops, most of which are concentrated in the western city area, and some are scattered in the four townships, but those are just some scattered small households. The date-making period is from the beginning of winter to the end of February of the following year, with only about four months of work; once spring arrives, due to climate conditions, they can no longer engage in baking.</p>
<p>The method of making dates is to build a stove about 15 feet long and 3 feet wide with earth bricks in an ordinary house, with five or six fire eyes dug on it. Then, hollow dates that have been pre-removed of their wooden pits are laid flat on a wire steel sheet and placed on top of the fire eyes for roasting. After a few minutes, they are moved once to make the heat even. After about an hour, the cauterized dates are ripe. This method seems simple at first glance, but no one dares to take on this task unless they are a skilled master with experience. According to insiders, when baking cauterized dates, if the placement is uneven or the heat is inaccurate when lighting the fire, the taste of the dates will be unpalatable. Therefore, those who take on this task are mostly the backbone figures of the workshop. Before the cauterized dates are baked, there is still a pitting procedure. This work is mostly done by women; each workshop employs about thirty women to remove the pits, and the daily wage is about 15 cents. In total, there are more than nine thousand women in each workshop removing pits. Therefore, in years of abundant date harvests, the livelihood of the general poor can be free from problems.</p>
<p>In the past, when transportation was underdeveloped, the cauterized dates, in addition to being supplied for consumption in the county, were transported to various counties for sale in old-fashioned wheelbarrows. The farthest sales only reached the border of this province; but in recent years, because transportation is not as obstructed as in the past, these types of cauterized dates are already sold in various parts of North China. Moreover, because cauterized dates were abundant last year, the price was extremely low. The price of first-class cauterized dates fell from about eight yuan to six yuan per hundred catties. As for second and third-class dates, they only sell for three or four yuan. Therefore, the strong sales of cauterized dates in Zhuoxian County this spring are a miracle rarely seen in previous years. In 1927, when Chuan Zuoyi was trapped in Zhuoxian County, he used cauterized dates to fill his stomach because the food supply had run out. He praised them greatly after eating them. It is said that this spring, he sent a secretary to Zhuoxian County and bought hundreds of catties of them.</p>

<p>Price per copy: 5 cents, General Distributor: Life Bookstore</p>
<p>Because I wanted to gain some knowledge about health, I subscribed to a copy of "Healthy World" to read. The contents of this publication are indeed suitable for my needs. After reading several issues, I have gained a lot of information about the hygiene rules of diet and daily life, and about the common sense of treating various seasonal diseases. Now, this publication has reached its fifth issue. In order to sincerely wish all "amateur" readers health, I am specifically introducing the recently released fifth issue of "Healthy World" here. This should be meaningful to general friends who hope for health.</p>
<p>In the fifth issue of "Healthy World," the first part of the text generally discusses the importance of health and the methods of maintaining health. Such as Ruiping's "The Health Problems of Citizens," Liutang's "Eighteen Characters for Maintaining Health," and Xianghou's "Enjoyment and Labor," etc. Among them, "Eighteen Characters for Maintaining Health" is the most brilliant. It proposes "Eat well, dress well, live well, have a good appetite, defecate well, sleep well" as the basic rules for maintaining health, and provides lively and interesting explanations and concrete rules for these basic rules. The second is to discuss the practical methods of strengthening the body more specifically, which can be especially cited Wu Yunrui's "Methods of Strengthening the Body." This text is a continuation of the previous issue - the fourth issue. If you can read the previous issue and this issue together, you can indeed get a lot of practical hygiene knowledge in daily life. After this, there are also columns such as "Healthy Family," "Sports Circle," and "Medical Spring and Autumn." Among them, such as "Honeymoon Travel and Health Principles," "How Old Can I Live?", "Common Sense of Vaccination," and "Experience in Describing Tai Chi Boxing Sutra," as well as "Ethical Issues in Medical Advertisements," "Death," "Pathology of Warm and White Smallpox and Principles of Typhoid Fever," "General Review of Surgical Drugs" ... These articles are also worth reading carefully. It can tell you some sexual knowledge, it can make you know some rules on how to exercise your body, it can make you get some pathological and scientific common sense, which can cope with the arrival of certain diseases.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some small things, such as "Healthy Maxims," such as "A Bundle of Strange News" including "Mother and Daughter Fighting for Property," "New Zealand Hurricane," "Hail in South Africa Like Cannonballs"... These articles are also worth noting and are interesting.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Recent Overview of Global Rubber Production and Consumption <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 品成</p>
<p>During the economic panic, all commodities showed a severe state of overproduction, and rubber, the most widely used and produced commodity, could not escape this fate. Therefore, in June of the year before last, the major rubber-producing countries of the world established the International Rubber Restriction Agreement to limit rubber production. Last year, some people in Southeast Asia even advocated a weekly rest, claiming that this measure had several benefits: "First, based on the natural fundamental law of permanent success; second, fair treatment for both European and local rubber companies, large and small; third, as a fundamental restriction method to balance supply and demand, benefiting both the physical and mental well-being of vehicle owners and workers, the physiological principle of metabolism is also beneficial to rubber, and rubber production should increase accordingly." In fact, the fundamental meaning of this proposal, in a nutshell, is simply an attempt to further restrict rubber production in Southeast Asia. Under such artificial production restrictions, the global rubber market has indeed shown a relatively positive trend recently. At the same time, due to the enthusiastic expansion of armaments by various countries in recent years, especially the resulting boom in the automotive industry, the global demand for rubber has also increased rapidly. Thus, with production restrictions on one hand and increased demand on the other, the result is naturally a relative improvement in the rubber market.</p>
<p>In reality, the stock of rubber held by major rubber-producing countries around the world has been decreasing day by day in the past year and this year. For example, the United States, mainly due to its own increased demand, saw its rubber stock decrease by approximately 60,000 tons last year. In addition, in the United Kingdom, rubber stock had increased to 177,000 tons by the end of September last year, but it decreased to 162,000 tons by the end of January this year. In the Straits Settlements and Malaya, a review of the situation in recent years shows that rubber stocks have also tended to decrease relatively. Now, to better understand the issue, we can present the following statistics on the recent state of rubber stocks around the world (unit: thousands of tons):</p>
<p>Based on the table above, we can see that: compared to 1933, world rubber consumption increased by 109,000 tons in 1934, but production increased even more, by 136,000 tons. As a result, world rubber production in 1933 exceeded consumption (overproduction) by 59,000 tons, and in 1934 it exceeded consumption by even more, 86,000 tons. However, compared to 1934, world rubber consumption increased by only 10,000 tons in 1935, but because production decreased by 150,000 tons, the result was a supply shortage of 74,000 tons, with consumption exceeding production. This is clearly due to the establishment of the International Rubber Restriction Agreement in 1934, which limited rubber production.</p>
<p>However, many contradictions have also emerged within the international rubber restriction. The most obvious is the difficulty in controlling the rubber exports of local people in the Dutch East Indies. This is because: first, without conducting surveys or land registrations of local rubber plantations, it is impossible to proportionally restrict the exports of each producer; second, the International Restriction Agreement stipulates too small a proportion for the rubber exports of local people in the Dutch East Indies. According to the provisions of the restriction agreement, the permitted export volume of local rubber in 1935 was 112,516 tons, but actual production was three to four times greater than this. Given these difficulties in controlling exports, the rubber exports of local people in the Dutch East Indies have actually exceeded the permitted volume in recent years, as follows—</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies government is naturally very distressed by this situation. Without a way to limit the increase in local production and exports, the Dutch East Indies government requested an increase in the export quota for local people in the first phase of last year, but because the world's rubber stocks were still trending upward at that time, the request was not approved by the various producing countries. As a result, the Dutch East Indies government could only continue to attack the local people, repeatedly increasing export taxes. Until the end of last year, due to the artificial improvement of the global rubber market, the International Rubber Control Committee substantially increased the export volume of the Dutch East Indies at its regular meeting in November, and also substantially increased the export quota for local people in the Dutch East Indies. However, because all situations are caused by artificially restricting production, the problem remains fundamentally unresolved.</p>
<p>Some people estimate, based on past situations, that world rubber consumption this year will be approximately 1.04 million tons, averaging 83,700 tons per month. Among these, the consumption volume of various countries in the world is roughly as follows (unit: thousands of tons)——</p>
<p>Based on this estimate, world rubber stocks may continue to decrease this year, and the rubber market may continue to improve.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>However, restrictions on rubber production will first affect the lives of workers. Taking the situation in the Dutch East Indies as an example, before the implementation of rubber restrictions, rubber workers earned more than one yuan per day, and there was a shortage of workers. However, after the implementation of rubber restrictions, various rubber plantations had to dismiss workers one after another, and at the same time reduce wages. As a result, some rubber workers had to leave their workplaces and seek other livelihoods, while others faced greater financial pressure due to reduced wages. Consequently, peddlers and even general stores in various rubber-producing areas lost a large number of customers, further deepening the market depression. Based on this manifestation, we can see that artificially restricting rubber production, creating an improvement in the rubber market, has resulted in affecting other industries in society, deepening the depression in other industries, and making the lives of most laborers more painful and impoverished. Therefore, in the final analysis, the recent situation of rubber production and consumption is still a distorted phenomenon generated within the current deformed world economic situation.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Review of the Inaugural Issue of "Nightingale" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 香草</p>
<p>Currently, besides the established "Literature," there are hardly any other literary publications to be seen. "Nightingale" is a small-scale literary publication. Judging from its inaugural issue, each section is evenly distributed, and it is no exaggeration to say that the content is rich.</p>
<p>However, none of the five essays grasp reality – none address issues beneficial to the country or the nation; Mr. Tang Tao's "On 'Extraordinary Times'" is relatively more meaningful, but it only speaks in vague terms. Of course, the barbarity of people like Fu ×× should be condemned, but it is not as cruel as the invasion of imperialism!</p>
<p>In terms of creative writing, Mr. Wang Renshu's "Mist" depicts the tragic lives of Chinese farmers from a lateral perspective. Farmers cannot make a living, so they take joining the army as a "way out," but being a soldier is far from their ideals, so they want to "escape," but where can they escape to? "Return to their hometown"? But "those who guard the fields are starving," in a word, "cannot escape death"! Therefore, dogs eating human flesh is commonplace. Currently, at a time when the nation is dying, we urgently need heroes of resolute determination, but we do not need heroes who fight among themselves. This piece is a complete work both in terms of meaning and technique. Mr. Zhuang Qidong's "Unemployed" focuses on describing the psychology of unemployed people seeking jobs, but after "hitting a wall," it does not leave him with the necessary awareness, and it is too simplistic to be considered a story. Mr. Fang Zhizhong's "A Group of Rebellious Women" is a reportage style piece. He singles out the daughter of a staff officer as the protagonist among a group of women, and makes that supposedly typical figure, Liu Ge Fei, play a supporting role, perhaps with his own intentions. I have discovered two characteristics in many of the author's works: first, he uses venomous strokes to ridicule the characters he dislikes; second, he mixes the characters' personalities into their actions and words. In addition, he also uses cartoon-like techniques to promote the development of the story. This piece still maintains this style. As for the evaluation of its significance to the times, the readers will know for themselves. Among the three essays, Mr. Dong Ping's "The Prophecy of the Saint" seems like a fable, the writing is too ornate, which blurs the meaning. Xi Ru's "From Ningjin to Shijiazhuang" can only be considered a travelogue. Luo Feng's "Beggar with a Violin" writes about a White Russian vagrant in Harbin, reminiscing about the luxury of the past and lamenting the cruelty of reality. I remember that Jiang Guangci once wrote "Lisa's Lament" on this theme, because the sentimental tone towards the protagonist was too heavy, the result was that he became her sympathizer. In this article, the author also committed the same mistake. Bai Shu and Shi Yu are two young poets, so their passion and righteous indignation are surging and pulsating in their poems, which is vastly different from the modernists and New Crescent School who decorate from the words. Both theoretical articles are translations, but the former is exactly the "Comforto" of the Chinese literary world today. There was a time in the Chinese literary world when the prejudice that content was more important than form prevailed, and what is the relationship between form and content? This article tells us everything. The latter is translated too awkwardly, and the problem also seems not very important. Introducing the anti-war writer Tolstoy, I think this is very important, although Tolstoy is a well-known writer to Chinese youth. Now the situation in all of Europe and the Far East has reached the most dangerous moment, and the most cruel second human massacre is about to appear before us. There is no doubt that we need great writers like Tolstoy. Mr. Yong Zhong's "Discussion After Reading Lu Xun's 'Old Tales Retold'" is just as the author said himself, "not a critic," "if anyone wants to treat it as criticism, 'it is bound to be disappointed.'" There are too few critics in China, and even fewer fair critics. The task of critics is to point out the advantages and disadvantages of works, so that appreciators can appreciate and later learners can learn or be warned. But Chinese critics (to put it mildly) either blindly praise or scold, fair criticism is rare, which is really the most serious problem in the Chinese literary world today.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Medical Scholar Jules Bordet <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>Jules Bordet was not only a famous and great medical scholar in Belgium, but also a figure worthy of special attention in the modern world of medicine. In 1919, he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and since then his achievements in medicine have spread even further around the world, and he himself has become a truly international medical scholar.</p>
<p>This great medical scholar was born in Soignies, Belgium, on June 13, 1870. He is currently a professor of bacteriology, parasitology, and epidemiology at the University of Brussels, and also the director of the Bruserpasteur Institut. He not only possesses the technical knowledge of a general physician, but also has in-depth research on the theories of physiology, medicine, and especially epidemiology. His appearance is very amiable, and at first glance, one can see that he is a gentle and studious scholar. However, we have no way to examine his childhood life, and it seems that there is not much need for examination, so now, the main goal is to introduce his research and its results, which should be more meaningful.</p>
<p>Dr. Bordet's most important research includes three aspects: the phenomenon of hemolysis, the phenomenon of complement fixation, and the discovery of the pertussis bacillus. He began his research in 1895, when he was already twenty-five years old. The year before, the German Faffel had discovered that cholera bacteria dissolved and disappeared in the abdominal cavity of guinea pigs. This is known as the Faffel reaction in medical science. Bordet naturally paid special attention to this matter, and after conducting his own practical experiments, he learned that this phenomenon was due to the action of guinea pig serum. According to his experiments, if cholera bacteria were used to perform immunization treatment, it would not be limited to guinea pigs, and the serum of other animals could also dissolve cholera bacteria.</p>
<p>It was in this experiment that Bordet grasped the essence of immunity. He paid special attention to red blood cells. The results of his experiments were that if red blood cells from animal A were injected into animal B instead of bacteria to perform so-called immunization treatment, then the serum of animal B would show the ability to dissolve the blood cells of animal A. This is called hemolysis. This type of experiment uses red blood cells to replace pathogenic bacteria, so there is no danger at all, and the experimental method is also very simple. The effectiveness can be clearly demonstrated within one or two hours. Dr. Bordet then gradually completed the analysis and research of the immune phenomenon. To say that the current theory of immunology originated from his research is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>In the above-mentioned hemolysis, there are two substances at play. One is expressed in the serum of the new animal through immunization treatment, which Dr. Bordet named sensitizer (Substance sensibilisnforius). The other has a direct effect of dissolving red blood cells, and exists in the serum of ordinary animals; this substance is called Alexin. Serum therapy, as we usually say, is a method of treating the human body by injecting the serum of immunized animals. In this way, the so-called immunity should be understandable.</p>
<p>After Dr. Bordet published the phenomenon of hemolysis, the German Ehrlich followed up with research on this issue. His views differed in many ways from Bordet's, so they engaged in a great debate, which is a matter worthy of special attention in the academic field of the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Dr. Bordet believes that the Alexin that plays the main role in the dissolution of cholera bacteria and the Alexin in the dissolution of red blood cells are the same substance (at this time, Alexin had been renamed Complement), so he paid special attention to this issue: that is, if the complement is eliminated once in order to dissolve cholera bacteria, then even if red blood cells are added at this point, the dissolution phenomenon will not occur. Then</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>He applied this complement fixation and discovered the pertussis bacillus; the greatness of the quality of his research can be said to have truly manifested from this point onward.</p>
<p>After Dr. Bordet applied complement fixation and discovered the pertussis bacillus, the German physician Wassermann used it to perform syphilis diagnosis, and thus Wassermann's reputation spread throughout the world. But according to knowledgeable people, Bordet's reputation is pure gold in terms of academics, while Wassermann's reputation is merely gilded.</p>
<p>Now, we can also briefly talk about the pertussis bacillus discovered by Dr. Bordet. The so-called spasm can be said to be a type of neurological disease; the state of this disease is the rapid contraction of muscles, that is, the general term commonly known as muscle cramps. Those who suffer from this disease are mostly children. The disease can be either mild or severe. In severe cases, it can end a small life within a few hours; and the disease is quite contagious, so it is very dangerous. However, the pathogen of this acute infectious disease in children has always been unknown, until Dr. Bordet discovered that a type of bacteria was cultivated in the throat of children suffering from this disease. However, it is difficult to present evidence for this discovery, because in fact, one cannot take a living child to experiment. Therefore, Dr. Bordet applied the above-mentioned complement fixation product to test it. The pertussis bacillus he cultivated was able to clearly prove the cause of pertussis by applying this complement diversion effect. His discovery has been recognized by scholars around the world; at the same time, due to his discovery, the prevention and treatment of so-called spasmodic diseases have established a certain effective approach. This is truly a great contribution to mankind.</p>
<p>Dr. Bordet has a son-in-law named Gengou, who is also a profound medical researcher and scientist. He is Dr. Bordet's assistant, and he worked hard on the research of hemolysis and pertussis bacteria; he certainly also provided great help to the doctor's research. He is currently a technician at the Belgian Health Bureau, very active, and his future achievements are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to report a piece of news: Dr. Bordet, whom we are talking about here, has been elected as the honorary president of the Second International Society for Bacteriology and Biology, which will be held in London in July this year. Just from this point of view, the doctor's reputation and status in the international medical and scientific communities can be fully imagined.</p>

<h3 id="e215">"Thirty Years Later" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>Recently, relying on a bit of youthful vigor, I carried out an action to break superstitions in my hometown, because in that city circle, like other city circles, there are always quite a few idle gentlemen. In order to pass the idle days, I don't know if it was due to "inspiration from outside the sky," they were fascinated by the mad monk Ji Gong, set up a spirit altar, and allowed the general ignorant men and women to inquire about karma and seek treatment for diseases, and surprisingly their "business was booming." But later, the behavior of those old gentlemen became more and more absurd, so we submitted a request to the county government to ban it, but it was rumored on the streets that the spirit channeling organization would soon be converted into a Buddhist branch. In fact, religion and superstition are by no means one and the same. Although we have no prejudice against religion, we firmly oppose superstition. In order to understand the truth of this matter, I specially went to ask the host of the Buddhist branch, a certain master of Chinese studies, and he sincerely told us: he did not participate in the spirit altar, but said: "Thirty years ago, I also tried hard to break superstitions, but the vast and subtle nature of Buddhism has recently made me dare not say a word." I couldn't help but shudder when I heard these words, "Thirty years ago," what a terrible period this is!</p>
<p>The question here is: Why did they try as hard as we did to break superstitions thirty years ago? Why couldn't the vast and subtle nature of Buddhism be discovered thirty years ago, but had to be discovered thirty years later?</p>
<p>I know what that master of Chinese studies means: you should not rely solely on youthful vigor to make a fuss about breaking superstitions. I am afraid that you will also be silent and no longer speak thirty years later. If my guess is correct, then I will be very grateful for his kindness. This is a lesson from the past.</p>
<p>There is also an old story in our hometown, saying that a certain young man learned martial arts from a boxer for three years, and thought that his skills were extraordinary and invincible. One day, the village was performing a community opera. There is a custom of "squeezing the head stage" in the countryside, which means relying on one's own strength to squeeze to the front of the stage to watch the opera. Those without strength can only stand behind the heads of people and cannot get a good position, so young people with strength and face in the countryside often have to squeeze the head stage. Of course, this young warrior also had to squeeze to the front of the stage, but he didn't know that the warrior who thought he was invincible was knocked down by another person with greater strength. He was very frustrated, very awakened, and knew that his strength was not enough, so he closed his doors to cultivate himself, sought another famous teacher, and studied for another three years. His skills became higher, but his self-confidence gradually disappeared, and he did not dare to move his fists and feet arbitrarily. The old people often used this story as a material to teach us, and also recited a jingle: "Three years of initial learning, can go everywhere, three years of further learning, difficult to move an inch." That master of Chinese studies probably thought of himself as a person who had "studied for another three years," and of course, our breaking of superstitions was just a greenhorn who had "studied for three years."</p>
<p>The above story cannot actually be used as a metaphor for our breaking of superstitions, because it is specious. Learning for three more years, recognizing that there is greater knowledge and skills in the world, making him feel that his academic skills are insufficient and striving to learn, this is indeed correct, but if, for the sake of the vast and subtle content of Buddhism, using a blurred gaze to look up at the towering giant, thinking that he will never be able to touch his head, and thus daring not to break superstitions, this is really not a true feeling of the profundity of the Buddhist party's content, but a symbol of old age, blood decay, and lack of courage!</p>
<p>China is a nation that decays early. Before reaching old age, they already hold a playful attitude towards the world. There is also a type of young people who "decay before old age," and hold a reclusive attitude like the elderly. The "thirty years ago" mentioned by that master of Chinese studies may still be considered a slightly distant time. Looking around, the sea has changed for ten years, and I am afraid it has already turned into mulberry fields! Many of the great men who made revolution thirty years ago have actually felt the vast and subtle nature of Buddhism and converted to Buddhism today after thirty years. As for us, we are probably still people of the "thirty years ago" era. I don't know if we will also convert to Buddha, convert to Dharma, and convert to Sangha in the "thirty years later" era?</p>

<p>"No accidents happened today, it can be said that we have fulfilled our responsibility to protect." He proudly surveyed everyone once, "However, the battalion commander has ordered me to take back the donation－－" He stared at me with force in his eyes, "Eighty yuan."</p>
<p>The words "donation" and the number were said especially brightly. I don't quite understand the situation in the countryside and don't know how to answer. But happily, my second brother went up and said very seriously:</p>
<p>"Officer, our 'wedding wine donation' has already been paid sixty yuan."</p>
<p>"The wedding wine donation is the wedding wine donation, this is the 'protection donation.'"</p>
<p>"We didn't ask anyone to protect us, and there's no such thing as a 'donation'," my second brother said angrily.</p>
<p>The platoon leader's face sank, and he immediately showed a ferocious expression:</p>
<p>"I don't care, this is 'official business'."</p>
<p>"Bird's 'official business', clearly fraud..."</p>
<p>Before the platoon leader finished speaking, he slapped him in the face, and then said sharply:</p>
<p>"Are you going to take it or not?"</p>
<p>At this time, my second brother didn't know where the energy came from, and suddenly rushed forward, speaking in a decisive tone:</p>
<p>"There is no money, you can take my life if you want!"</p>
<p>The platoon leader pulled his slanted belt, raised his pistol with his right hand, "Okay! You dare to resist official business." Then he tilted his head and said to the soldiers next to him, "Come! Tie him back to the town!"</p>
<p>So a few wolf-like soldiers immediately grabbed my second brother, and the rest aimed their guns as if they were about to shoot. The timid guests hurried back to avoid them, and the family members were watching from the door with their hands and feet clenched. I know that the ending of this matter is not serious, but it will always cost a few dollars to settle the matter. So I persuaded my second brother to stop, and asked the platoon leader not to be angry. The bolder guests also came to help say good things, and the platoon leader allowed him not to be taken away, but the money had to be paid immediately. As a result, after our repeated requests, it seemed like settling a homicide case, and only then did we agree to a "donation" of thirty yuan, plus ten yuan for the soldiers' cigarette and tea expenses. In the end, my mother mournfully brought out forty yuan, which I gave to the platoon leader. He counted the amount and said very peacefully:</p>
<p>"This is the battalion commander's order, the brothers are just doing their duty."</p>
<p>After the soldier masters took the money away, everyone in the family was like they had lost their souls. My second brother fell weakly on the bamboo chair, his chest rising and falling as if his breathing was about to stop!</p>
<p>Soon the sky became dark, and my brother's happy event sank into the darkness!</p>

<p>Silent iron is a piece of scrap iron.</p>
<p>A thief says: I used the thought of "others steal even more fiercely than I do" to comfort my conscience.</p>
<p>A clever person, when drunk, becomes doubly clever.</p>
<p>A person who has had smallpox, even if recovered, always has scars.</p>
<p>Only when the dim twilight secretly begins to creep into life can one feel that the spring storm is the freshest and most precious.</p>

<p>"Green Lang" Xu Wenhao is said to have changed his profession again. He has strummed the sanxian, drunk at "The Wanderer," and now learned to tell stories. From today onwards, every afternoon from 9:45 PM to 10:30 PM, he will broadcast "Memories of the Sea Journey" on Hangye; what he "remembers," the audience will naturally understand. (Jin Lang)</p>
<p>Today from 12:45 PM to 1:30 PM, Li Shude will broadcast the Thunder and Lightning Drama Society's play "Anniversary," performed by Lin Fei, Anna, Jin Yi, Ma Ling, Feng Yi, etc. Also, the Qingbai Drama Society will broadcast "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Municipal Music Hall, performed by Qiu Mengliang, Yan Ping, Wu Duxiao, Liang Feng, Xu Yu, etc., from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Old Cai wrote to a friend saying: "A Lost Sheep" is almost finished filming, but the closing procedures still need some time. - Although few scenes were filmed, he has not wasted a single day.</p>
<p>At the Yangtze Dance Hall's banquet for the press, "Revolutionary" Huang Tian did not arrive in a Zhongshan suit, which was disappointing. Someone wanted to dance "Revolutionary Object," but it was cancelled because he was not wearing a Zhongshan suit.</p>
<p>The names of the forty founders of the Film Industry Association have been signed. The actor representatives who signed were Hu Die for Mingxing, Gao Zhanfei, Chen Yanyan and Li Zhuozhuo for Lianhua, and Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun for Yihua.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Film Industry Association will live to be a hundred years old and not become like tea parties, where the venue gets higher and higher and the number of people gets smaller and smaller. And hopefully, it will do some real "association" work.</p>
