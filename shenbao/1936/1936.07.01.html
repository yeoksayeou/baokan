<h3 id="c12">論法國的外交 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>記得一個美國名記者曾經說過「法蘭西總是從一架德國的三稜鏡中認識世界的」不錯卽如這次英國撤銷對意制裁的提議法新內閣原是　示不贊成的然而終於不得不同意了這重要的原因就是恐怕得罪意大利因而促成她和德國結合來壓迫法國又如日前法外長台爾博斯在衆院宣布外交政策提出集體安全制的兩要點　凡興侵略國鄰近各國須出其全力以抵抗侵略國　國聯會其他各會員國對於侵略國務當一律實施經濟財政制裁這所謂侵略國不就是暗指着德國嗎</p>
<p>法蘭西是一個感着疲倦而且知足的國家它惟恐德國實施報復只想維持現狀與和平戰後法國的外交政策就一向以「安全保障」做骨幹處處防止義德國的侵略普恩加賚如此白里安如此、巴爾都賴伐爾以及佛蘭亭都無不如此爲了這不惜與社會主義的蘇聯合作不惜跟多年的敵人意大利携手並且廣結與國以包圍德國</p>
<p>可是現在德國又强大起來了戰後法國所造成的安全保障已失去效力了法國主持下的國聯受了希特勒和墨沙里尼兩重巨大的打擊波蘭已投到德國的懷裏去了小協的因「納粹」的挑撥離間顯得漸形疏遠所謂「斯特萊柴陣綫」也已崩潰意國的援助旣不可靠而英法鑿柄的關係更給希特勒造機會在目前只剩法蘇協定爲法國僅有的保障了</p>
<p>在這樣孤立的外交形勢下法新內閣的工作確乎是極其艱重的親德有所不能因爲希特勒向外發展的氣燄愈漲愈高兩國利益决計無調和可能了意國雖不致成仇敵但也不能做好友而且最近意德的接近（據哈瓦斯二十四日電意航次訪問柏林有與德結成法西斯陣綫之說）更使意法的友誼多了一層隔膜又如法國决定撤銷對意制裁後意報還不免報以冷笑譏駡從這也可見羅馬協定的親善時期已將過去了至於英國她素不願法國是歐洲命運的支配者且對於新興的社會黨政權多少懷着憎厭的情緒又如這次爲了修改國聯盟约英法已恐不免發生裂痕了在這樣陰霾的外交氣候之下勃倫內閣究將怎樣打開外交的難關呢</p>
<p>勃倫內閣秉承了人民陣綫的外交綱頗認爲和平是整個而不可分割的安全是集體的法國要爲自己謀安全必須同時爲歐洲謀和平所以當勃倫二十三日在參院宣布外交政策時首先就提出締結區域公約以促進集體安全制這一點法新內閣認爲要打破目前的難關必須加强和平陣綫的力量使法蘇恊定擴大到所有愛好和平的國家使所有愛好和平的國家都團結起來這樣纔可使侵略者與和平勢力的陣綫分明法國的安全纔能有保障侵略者的野心纔可以戢歛然而這郤是一椿艱苦繁重的工作够蓋佗賽的先生們深思苦慮的</p>

<p>溯歐陸佛化之初步、約在十九世紀之末年、據德國八十四齡佛徒C．T．Staauss，Frankfurt　am　Mrin之自述、計自一八八七年即已得讀Edwin　Arnold氏所著之亞洲之光（Ligrt　of　Asia）、一八九一年印度成立摩含菩提學社（Mahabodhi　Society）、八四佛徒當時係屬社員之一、該社主持者印僧Anagasika　Dharmapala於一八九三年代表錫蘭赴美芝加哥出席世界宗教大會、該德人即就此僧正式受戒者、</p>
<p>一九〇四年間英人Alan　Bennett、法號Ananda　Metteyya、由邱輸入佛教於英國、但不數年去世、其徒為邱行雜誌名佛徒評論（Buddhist　Review）者以紀念之、該誌印行垂十二年之久、後以移資建築佛徒精舍（Buddhist　Lodge）停版、佛徒精舍初名通神學舍寄宿舍（Lodgeof　the　Theosophical　Society）精舍落成未久、印僧Anagarika　Dharmapala遄來佈道、另創佛教佈道會（BuddhistMission　41，）迄今稱盛、佛教佈道會中亦有摩含菩提學社之設立、現為英國佛教之中堅、一九三四年九月、該社召開第一次歐陸佛徒代表大會、濟濟蹌蹌極一時之盛、</p>

<p>此外利勿浦亦有佛教傳道會之設、內容不詳</p>
<p>德國佛教會之創設始於一九二二年、會名Gemeinde　um　Auddha地址在柏林、創辦者德人Herrl　Martin　Steinke今已被剃為和尚、法號道傳（Tao　Chun）、出有雜誌名Lie　Brockensammlung少後又有德人Dr．Paul　Dahlke（已故）另創佛寺於柏林、寺為一精美之殿宇、其徒每逢朔望均舉行佈道祝典、東方人士之來隨喜者、時不乏人、一九三三年之夏Ananda　Kansayayana法師在此證道、又日僧Junji　Sukakibara曾來住兩年、又三年前Rehela　Sankrityayana法師來住兩週、除此之外有Georg　Grimm創三寶殿（Lodg　of　Three　Tewels）、而於漢堡（Hamburg——由Herr　Persian主持）及哥尼堡（Konisburg）則又各有一佛教會舍、按上述Dr．Dahlke所創之精美佛殿、係名Das　Buddhistische　Hosu　主持者Mr．Guide　Auster、法國佛教社（Guide　Auter　Les　Smis　du）為年前太虛法師遊歐洲時所剙設的、社員有法德英美俄匈等國人士、</p>

<p>記者述西方佛徒之言論、竟不禁重有感焉、　佛教果能阻止歐洲之物質主義、侵略主義、及自利主義耶、東方弱小民族將永賴佛教以生存耶、世界人類果不需要物質文明耶、是數問題、就目前世界之現狀觀之、恐尚屬空談立想、　西方佛徒之認識佛教較淺、亟需東方佛教團體扶助、在佈道經費方面亦亟需東方扶助、東方人士得無動於中否、　此種東西文化對流、將於何時如水之寒熱對流、克底於均、大同大同、跋予望之、</p>

<p>謝邱遺產訴訟</p>
<p>邱仁高出有五萬元字據　並追首飾官諭調卷商核</p>
<p>德醫邱仁高、現年四十三歲、原籍浙江上虞、其先世因紅羊之亂、遷避來滬、遂久居之、有傳其祖本姓謝、亦有言姓王者、至仁高之父、以為邱氏鰲婿、因襲邱姓、而其堂兄慶元、則仍姓謝、慶元之元配生三子、長錫恩·次惠恩·幼巧恩·繼室生恩美·恩娟·恩新、三女現均在求學、惟慶元生前頗寵愛繼室、故將一應財產、悉付掌管、子女概不得過問、仁高與該婦、</p>
<p>分屬叔嫂</p>
<p>俱絕不顧瓜李之嫌、異常親暱、迨慶元物化、更明目張膽、公然同居於法租界之白爾路五十一號、將慶元遺產、任意揮霍、錫恩與諸弟妹、雖知而莫敢言、前年夏間、見母病危、恐一旦逝世、則故父遺產、究有若干、將無從稽考、始偕諸弟妹同赴大華醫院、向繼母詢問時、仁高亦在側、該婦自知不起、即含</p>
<p>淚囑子女</p>
<p>謂、汝父一生所積、概在四叔（指仁高）處、仁高驟聞婦語、頓形不悅、不待該婦言畢、亂以他詞、旋命錫恩與之同歸、給其五萬元之字據、錫恩當時以嘗聞父遺財產、數有十萬、乃僅得半數之字據、頗不願受、仁高方言明餘資已因與婦做買賣標金之投機生意虧耗、嗣隔數日、該婦病故、錫恩遂持此五萬元字據、向仁高索欵、詎仁高一再延約、至去夏、忽以該據係被錫恩用手槍威脅書寫為言、堅不承認、錫恩覺其叔竟欲</p>
<p>鯨吞全部</p>
<p>遺產、心殊不甘、即聯合兩弟三妹、向第一特區地方法院、對邱仁高提起交還遺產五萬元之控訴、曾經一度開庭、後因邱堅稱該據由於原告用強暴脅迫行為取得、引起刑事問題、是案乃暫停止、此後其叔姪雙方、亦改投上海地方法院、另打刑事官司、荏苒至今、時逾一載、刑訟案件、茲已經過江蘇高等法院兩審結束、於是</p>
<p>舊事重提</p>
<p>復回第一特院、再涉五萬元遺產之訟、昨日下午由莫潤華推事開庭傳訊、被告邱仁高不到、委律師代表出庭、原告錫恩惠恩巧恩兄弟三人、及恩娟恩新兩姊妹、均投案、祗恩美臥病在家、未能到庭、當由謝錫恩代表諸弟妹發言、略述經過舊情、謂故父財產、係託被告與繼母管理、共有現欵八萬、地產值二萬、被告與繼母曾同居白爾路、繼母死後、其首飾等物、亦已被取去、故今除控追五萬元遺產外、所有首飾。亦應令交還、此案前曾經錢中逍陳文燦兩、</p>

<p>四﹑北貨之品名與來源　　　　　　北貨範圍甚廣。凡關東貨，川漢貨，遼陽貨，天津貨等皆稱為北貨。天津栗子，紅棗，胡桃，瓜子，白瓜子，葵花子，杏仁，蝦米；河南金針菜，瓜子，大頭菜，仙米；山東瓜子，膠子，黑棗，柿餅，耿餅，生仁，花生，府面，粉絲，五香菜，香椿菜，棗冬菜，栗子，黃唇膠；關東松子，黃麻，紅旗參，鹿巾，醜巾，蛤士蟆，米仁；張家口蘑菇，瓜子；湖南湘蓮，瓜子；煙臺干貝，蝦尾，蝦子，南子，生仁，花生；徐州金針菜，瓜子，生仁，花生；錫山瓜子；亳州紅棗，金針菜；六合南瓜子；濟寧瓜子，黑棗；揚州芝麻。</p>

<h3 id="c180">暑期中的學生國貨運動 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>時間像流水般的逝去，一刹那，民國二十五年度的暑假，又已開始了。在這各級學校開始暑假的時候，記者對於許多熱心而有為的青年，實抱有無限的希望，我熱烈的，誠懇的希望諸位有志的青年學子，除了在暑假之中，努力於自己學業的進修之外，更分些精神時間，來替國貨運動做點工作，使我們的國貨運動，因了諸位青年學子的努力，在夏令之中，特別顯著的表示出優異的成績來。怎樣做法？我的意見，是有下百數項。</p>
<p>組織國貨宣傳團　國貨之提倡，首重宣傳，在暑假中，青年學子大可聯絡附近同學，或故鄉有志青年，組織一個國貨的宣傳團，每日或間日的出發宣傳一次，使本鄉同胞，深切的明瞭提倡國貨的重要，和認識服用外貨的危機。我相信：用學子們誠懇的態度，流利的口吻，以身作則的精神，這個國貨宣傳團的成績，定然可觀的。</p>
<p>檢查家用器物　提倡國貨，須從家庭做起，而後才有大效。在每個家庭之中，能購用國貨器物的，固然不少；可是魚目混珠，誤用外國貨的，定也不少。青年學子，在暑假之中，大可把家庭的器物，檢查一下，何者為國貨？何者為非國貨？必須定出一個標準來，並附帶宣傳各國貨工廠的出品，及其商標地址等，這樣一來，今後家庭方面服用的東西，大多數必能屏棄外貨而購用國貨了。</p>
<p>宣傳走私狀況　走私問題，現在真是鬧得嚴重極了！怎樣使一般同胞認識走私的嚴重性？如何使一般同胞能決心的不購私貨？不用私貨？這是一個當前很重要的問題。青年學子應該利用暑假的余睱，對走私問題作一個普遍的宣傳，使成千成萬的各地同胞，都能一致的知道走私的嚴重性，而相戒不購走私貨，這真是急不待緩的一　事情。</p>
<p>總而言之，國難危急到這個地步，國貨事業垂危到如此景況，諸位有為的青年學子，在暑假中的光陰，是應該鄭重的消磨過去的，豈僅對國貨運動努力已哉！</p>
<h3 id="c181">貢獻於國貨的推銷團 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨之發展，一半在製造，一半在推銷，製造之責，工廠任之，推銷之責，人人應盡其力，而國貨推銷團之組織，尤有力量。國貨推銷團之任務，有四點：</p>
<p>分赴個學校推銷學生用品，乘便宣傳提倡國貨與服用國貨之要旨。</p>
<p>分赴各個家庭，推銷家庭用品，遍布各裏各坊之住宅，與主婦作懇切之談話。使之澈底明瞭服用國貨之利益，與習慣於服國貨，彼此間結一甚好之情感，以後各家庭不用貨品則已，用必等待推銷員之上門。</p>
<p>分赴各各鄉各村，使一般人民，都知國貨之精美，比用洋貨，為益實多，養成農村人民個個“非國貨不服，非國貨不用”之精神。</p>
<p>分各赴機關各團體以及工商業之廠店，勸導職員，店員，工人，學徒個個都應服用國貨，以免工人之失業，與工商業之崩潰。</p>
<p>國貨推銷，要有如水銀瀉地，無孔不入之現象。然後國貨之疆土日廣，國貨之生路日多，任推銷員之條件有四：</p>
<p>（一）要耐勞耐苦，尤要耐得住氣。</p>
<p>（二）要有深入工夫，隨機應變，到學校則說學校話，至家庭講家庭情形，見老人談談補品，見小孩看看玩具，此為推銷員應有之工夫。</p>
<p>（三）要有調查能力，某處用慣某物處喫慣某品，投人所好，合人胃口，此種工夫不可不有。聞某推銷員擅長此法，每日可做三十元之營業。</p>
<p>（四）要合社會心理，到某處，應說某種話，販某品，應考求某品之真偽。尤其非從大眾心理上入手不可。總之，對物易，對事難，殊不知對人更難。合於社會心理一語，看似容易，實行很難。</p>
<p>今康元罐廠又收撤銷員之辦法，委託中華職教社辦理，既於廠商百利而無一弊，且藉此可以維持數千數百之失業者，使用戶得安心滿意之用品，而失業者人人有事可作，此為解決失業者之根本問題，萬萬不容認為毫無希望之工作。此有希望之將來，都在推銷員之金科玉律。更希望各廠商之繼起信辦以造福於一般失業的同胞。</p>
<h3 id="c182">「夏」與國貨 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>時序的推進，是並沒有因了我們「經濟的國難」，而慢慢支滑過去，當現下我們看到寒暑表的溫度，在一天天上升，摩登女郎，早已披上了喬琪紗的旗袍，裸著玉趾，在街頭招搖過市的時候，我們是知道，那「市民國貨年」的夏季，是又來臨了</p>
<p>夏是氣候上一大轉變的時期，人們生活，因感到它的影響而急幫購置一切夏令用品的季節，所以在這時候，各個商店公司中五光十色貨品的雜選，衣屐翩蹉顧客的加多，都已在十足表現出了「夏」的魔力，可是在這裏，我又像要神經過敏地想到，依照過去的事實和經驗，在國人普遍地崇拜洋貨心理下，那一個夏季的開始，卻正是又給洋貨以傾銷的好機會。像舶來和喬其紗呵　絲織品呵！汽水呵！啤酒呵！暗香呵！電扇呵！草帽呵！汗衫呵！這許多東西，是就在這個時候，要在我國市場上大肆活躍，搜括了我們巨額的大好金錢而去。因此，在這國民經濟，更其衰弱，國難益嚴重的當前，我們要大聲疾呼，“再不要購一分洋貨，喪失民族一分元氣。多購一分國貨，就是增加國家一分力量。”來：</p>
<p>在最後，我就要介紹幾種夏令必需的國貨用品，敢貢獻在生個採購夏令物品的人們前，那晨服裝方面。如三友實業社的各種夏令布疋，毛巾浴巾，五和織造廠的鵝牌汗衫，在用具方面，如三星的蚊香，華生的電扇，立鶴牌的面盆，洗衣盆，華福草帽，五洲亞林防疫水等。在飲食方面，如煙臺啤酒，益利汽水，冠生冷食罐頭等。這許多家喻戶曉，風行全國的國貨佳品，久為社會樂用，故也毋庸逐一瑣述，不過，於本文之末，作者以最大熱忱，希望全國同胞，在這私貨正方充斥全國，肆行傾銷的現下，千萬勿食圖細便宜，貽亡國之恨，而急應愛護國產，發展工商，挽救奄奄一息的民族經濟的危機。</p>

<h3 id="c183">天利阿母尼亞的效用談 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 欣甫</p>
<p>在寫字間辦公的職員，因為自上午九十起至下行五時止，都是伏案工作，所以身心均感不適，頭腦昏昏，極為疲倦，在這樣的情景下，祇只將阿莫尼亞稍嗅之後，那末就能立刻清神醒腦，變成一個精力飽滿的人，辦公起來就能收『事半攻倍』之效，它是不刺激心臓亦不傷神經系的一服唯一興奮劑</p>
<p>『天利阿莫尼亞』在沐浴的時候，全身齷齪，都能洗得精光無遺，並且使皮膚滑潤，頓時感覺異常的舒暢，一方面逐可增進皮膚的抵抗力……酷熱炎暑的盛夏，每個家庭間，都是少不了它的。</p>
<p>家用阿莫尼亞，對於鬍鬚的人，特別發生好感。因為阿莫尼亞能使鬚毛漸漸變軟，並且還能夠減少修面的次數，又如在修面刀片滯鈍時，只要浸數秒鐘在天利阿莫尼亞中，然後揩幹，那末就能使刀片銳利如新。</p>
<p>加半格阿莫尼亞在腳盆熱水內，臨睡時浸而洗之能使快感舒適，令人熟睡，如患有失眠症的人，可說是必備的良藥。</p>
<p>一經被蚊子或毒蟲吮咬後，立刻將阿莫尼亞塗搽，就能在一刹那間解除苦痛，去毒消腫。</p>
<p>倒半格『天利阿莫尼亞』（勿攪水）置於房中，能使空氣清潔，如在病房間中，那末就可避免菌類的傳染</p>
<p>誰都知道植物是能調節氣氣與炭酸氣的，花卉能使人的性情怡悅，有一種愉快的感覺，所以植物花卉與人的生活似乎有不能脫離之密切關係在，但是我們應該怎樣以謀保護呢？就是將少許阿莫尼亞和於一加倫的水中去灌溉植物花卉之根，每星期澆二次，（切勿間斷）</p>
<p>用『天利阿莫尼亞』去洗絲織品及毛織品，有下列特殊的效力：　不泛黃　不褪色　光澤可愛　不損質料　易於乾燥　不致縮短。</p>
<p>阿莫尼亞對於女子的沐髮，亦有很大的效力的，他能使頭發油垢盡去光亮潤澤，用於洗衣『去垢除汅，遠勝肥皂』，並且省去種種麻煩，較用肥皂粉更為簡便</p>
<p>「明窗淨幾」這是多麼整潔的一個快樂家庭，至於如使使窗明幾淨呢？那末就是應用「天利阿莫尼亞」特一定能保證你「稱心滿意」</p>
<p>其余的用途，還有許多，在這裏因為篇幅所限亦不能一一盡述了，所望於國人對「優良的國貨」多多購用，使國產工業充分發展，而一方面亦可由幾個國貨廠商的努力進行以及國民的盡量採用使國家經濟充裕起來。</p>

<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>甚雨終宵，簾波如雪，遙想秧田錄處，蛙聲當怒震矣。吾鄉有「蛙多稻熟，雨多蠶婦哭」之諺，盡蛙能食蝻，農氓驗豐歉於微蟲，較社占信而有徵也。用是自為約法，禁補甚嚴；每當春夏之交，一任鼓吹於池塘野水間，幸不幸與魴　之競登刀俎，有間已。滬市塞渠填浜，水草盡失，此聲已不可得。僅偏近田野處，月下經過，猶科隱約於耳鼓中，當謂蛙亦侯蟲之一，喚春農作力，無啻促織之催嬾婦，一年一度，民生所漀。然繁市浮少，飫艷曲，溺靡音，孰知十許裏外，有此天籟哉？無感乎長時荒亡，昧稼穡而莫之矜卹也。</p>
<p>蛙應農節，亦協古詩：　蒿滿地　芽短，此蝌蚪活動時也；桃花淨盡菜花黃，則池塘聒噪時也。新雨初止，濕月流黃，使坐虛　靜聽，凡遠近遞續相應者，如囂鼓亂鳴，警析競；若將軍令嚴，戰士怒殷；其氣雄，其聲壯，與秋蟲一味哀涼者，不可並語。故見時夜窗課罷，消受繁音，投筆作色，自為意氣，不數祖生聞雞時也。及今世味既飽，春夢都醒，江湖宿處，聞此聲自撫頭顱，萬感坌集：歲序環流，我志未酬，坐殘燈花，咄咄喚奈何爾！</p>
<p>蛙雖昆蟲，而棲息有機，盡靜夜　，不慮襲捕，近乎巧。膚色者浮於藻，色斑則墊於岸或樹根，自為隱蔽，著目都迷，近乎智。若當而怒，激張頹氣，則赫然為大勇矣。值茲風雲慘淡之秋，安得捉十萬怒蛙，分置通　，使越王其人者一一為之式則士庶之有勇者，因以感，因以興，或有可為乎！</p>
<p>江灣沈一士最養蛙，闢地抅舍，四周圍籬，中盤池凡三，除岸隙薄栽花草外，充滿利蘆水間者，盡為青腹綠背之暇蟆。晴時有雲影天光，倒瀉碧波，著蛙或泳或躍，散作餘綺；歎濠梁妙趣，不此之過。入夜暗花承露，水面微蝕，若繁星歷亂被吞，正振舌掀波以起也。余兩過其地，諸樂都領。其種有採自美洲者，碩大埒蹲狸，售興西人，每對可獲五金餘。至飼料能自覓水蟲，無煩給養。古有玩鶴以相終者，此則隱於蛙已。結盧人境，車馬不擾，雖說幽荒，亦有鼓吹，誠何必臂深山，高謝區緣而始得耶？</p>
<h3 id="c187">青陽港之行 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>星期日的上午，跟著朋友，往青陽港去觀劃盤賽，藉以一　長期蜇居在都市之中，所積的煩悶。</p>
<p>這一天，天氣不冷，也不過熱，真可說得天朗氣清，惠風和暢。在初升的太陽光中，前進著，談談笑笑，車輪已輾離了上海，投進了大自然的懷抱中去了。車窗外面的一片青綠色，把我們的視線，吸了過去，盡黃色麥浪，衝破了我們腦海中一切灰色的印象，而使我們驚異著季節已輪到了割麥插禾的時序了。</p>
<p>車輪機械地輾過了若幹車站，終於在我們的目的地，把我們吐出了車廂。真是夠使我們驚奇的，這早已有不少的紳士與姑娘，在江邊，在原野裏徘徊著。唔，這些或許是在一上天，便從都市裏逃出來，而到這所在來，度著所謂週尾的。不錯，在這農村中，也盡有著「霍攤爾」，足浴高貴的紳士與姑娘們停驂駐蹕。</p>
<p>我們一行是三人，都裝成了一副詩人的嘴臉，在麥浪中，躺一會，在綠蔭下，坐一會，在青陽港濱，低著頭兒踱一會。太陽從透明的空氣中，射過來，我們三個人，都長長地行了一陣深呼吸，呼吸了幾口不用代價的新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>劃船賽是開始了。十條船兒，在水波不興的青陽港中，鼓樂前進，博得了兩岸觀眾的水少鼓掌聲。更其是有一　近二十位的女學生跳躍著富有旋律的步子，用富有韻律的調子，鼓勵著劃船者，前進，努力的前進。</p>
<p>中午時，在一家農村小飯館裏，進了食，鮮魚鮮蝦，雖然是樸質無華，其味，卻很是鮮美。同行的老胡，花了法幣一元，購了盡長二尾大鯽魚，一斤活跳的鮮蝦，以備歸遺細君，並資佐證。</p>
<p>飯後，在農村中，兜了一會，在三點不到些，又鑽進了，火車肚子裏。挺巧的，那近二十位的女學生，也正搭的是這節。一節火車中，容下了這麼近二十位的活潑而美麗的安琪兒，車中的空氣，是充滿著桃色的氣氛了。</p>
<p>清脆的笑聲，再和著美妙的英文名曲的歌聲，全車搭客的視線，是完全集中在十幾個大草帽兒，所浮動著的車廂的一角裏去。</p>
<p>火車，在柔和的太陽光下，很有規律地前進，不知不覺地，已緩緩地給拖進了上海北站的站臺。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>兩岸是深濃的綠色，水亦是深濃的綠色，悠長的流水載著織細的浮萍，遲緩地，跟隨著六月的風，浮過我的眼底，向我背後而消逝。</p>
<p>『人不是如浮萍這樣的飄浮於世面嗎？』這刺人的問語不知是從那兒流過來的，望著彎曲的長岸，和隱遮在濃蔭裏的村舍，坐在船頭上，噴著淡淡的煙圈，一片茫然的感覺，和流水一同地，向眼前湧過來，岸上野薔薇笑著，白色和粉紅，可是萎謝了的花朵，瓣瓣落英，飄落於水邊的污泥上，將永遠埋葬了它的色，它的香，它的逗人的一切……了呵！</p>
<p>於是，我不敢掉過腦袋去瞧船艙中的苔莉了，伊是混跡風塵中，被生活鞭撻著的女人，有著野薔薇的色，野薔薇的香，可是這日子恐終於不會長久的吧，被生活的巨風吹謝於污泥般的命運裏。永遠埋葬了伊。</p>
<p>垂柳統統，輕輕拂著水面，三三兩兩的鄉童，不顧污泥沒膝，在探取他們所愛好的新鮮的寶貝的，僅是幾只小　蟹，那種微笑的會激動我脆　弱的心弦的。這世界不就有著許多人終年踏在污泥裏探求生活實藏嗎？——在六月的風裏，船是慢慢的拐過灣去。</p>
<p>又是悠長的綠岸，又是悠長的綠水，又是飄飄而過的浮萍。</p>
<p>而我卻感到水鄉的寂莫了，苔莉卻在艙裏唱著熱烈的『印第安土人歌』，是不測，發現哪，伊居然露出不知苦楚的笑意。悄悄地，重又點上一支煙擲，一口，二口，……吸著，亦沒關照梢後的船夫，把我們劃到什麼地方為止。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　雨細風斜還來留跡處　夜　人靜獨寫絕交書</p>
<p>碰到他時，他的態度是很安適並不象害了病人。可是他也不帶怒色，似乎也不是生了什麼人的氣。這位姑娘的態度，不能不說是令人難測了。這期間是有一週，他卻另有一了個法子，來解決這層困難，原來他卻把這番勇氣，已經用在筆尖上，寫了一封信，寄到蘿蘭的學堂裏去了。夢蘭到學堂裏去的時候，號房送過信去。他看到是一個夾層的印花信封，上面一筆很秀媚的字寫著振坤女學堂江夢蘭小姐慧啟。下欵署著，本城章緘。夢蘭一看到，不出得心裏亂跳了一陣。口裏可就說著，這是女子師範學堂裏來的信。章小姐沒來，寫著信好玩。說著這話時，看看身邊還沒有什麼人，趕快拿著信就走到校園避靜的地方。看看附近無人，然後就在一叢芭蕉陰下，坐在短欄幹上，背對著人行路，捧了信紙，看起來。那信上寫道：</p>
<p>夢蘭女士文鑒：今突以蕪函奉讀，自知冒昧矣。然當今社會文化增進，男女交際，一視平等，方之西俗又屬尋常。女士方攻讀西人所辦之學校，姑以西俗自圓其說，或可諒　；然而傾慕之忱，則非虛也。僕不敏，筆耕養母於此，自知庸陋，不見重於士林。乃兩月以還，每值女士於途，恍　如光風霧月，清氣撲人未解何故，竟如葵之遇日，不能遏其傾向。然管窺轟測，究未也求知於女士也。其後嘗見女士挾示上流行之雜誌家，視其封面，盡僕所常有拙文刊載者。遂悟淺溥之作，已久為慧眼所青及。古人高山流水，得一知音，可以死而無憾。僕誠不敢以知音相辱芝蘭之質。然心儀其人，不能無言。又以為人謹訥詞無以出口。耿耿於懷，不知其可。日前偶訪遠戚，彼有一妹，亦攻讀貴校。無意中於其家，得讀貴校校友錄，玉照與芳字，宛然並在。遂得護此一線郵程，藉呈片柬。若能恕其魯莽，許作文字之交，則魚鴻多便，敢情於楮墨之間，互謀攻錯。言實　衷，他非敢望也。偶集古人句：我是人間惆悵客，落花時節又逢君。此情此景，十四字中，有千萬言不能盡者，故是函之作，徘徊心頭，兩日夜書半擱置懷中又一日夜，乃終以付郵。縱獲罪妝次，豈得已哉？敬謹肅呈，不勝徨徬待命之至。章國器上言（四二）</p>

<h3 id="c192">鄉居瑣話 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>有許多人，口口聲聲在高唱著「到農邨去」。可是，你只要留心他的住處，卻許久時候還是寄跡在某某馬路富麗堂皇的洋房裏，這正是和天天在提倡國貨的朋友自已身上卻老穿著來路貨的西裝，是同一滑稽。</p>
<p>實在話，農邨裏的空氣是太好了，惜乎交通終究不便，要是性情孤僻，不好熱中的朋友，住在那裏很合式的。不過，好空氣換不來麥包吃，現在真正的鄉裏人，卻老是想望都市裏跑。</p>
<p>我算來已經鄉居有兩年光景了，一切習慣，倒還不覺怎樣的不便，孱軀居然也會壯實些，這就可以證明鄉野間大自然適合人生的好處。就拿夏季裏的蚊蟲而論吧，也會比較都市裏來得強得多。並且它們的活動時間也比較得長久些，嗡嗡的蚊陣自五月裏起始，一直要到十月底邊才會得聽不見，要是我上年沒有預備家庭工業社的無敵牌蚊煙香的話，那麼，也許要早就「回到都市」去了。</p>
<p>去夏一個雨天，無敵牌是用完了，買到了兩盤新牌的，那真就苦我足足一個整夜不能合眼。我們的那些鄰居，有的用蚊帳的，還是不中用，有的點土制的蚊煙條，煙性是濃烈的，人嗅到了容易咳著嗆，所以現在也都改用價廉物美的無敵牌了。</p>
<p>這些日子，正交進了楣令，氣候是潮濕得可以，象我這種濕重的體質，胃納時常會覺得呆滯，平常素來好喝淡茶的，一到這兩天，淡茶是不很敢喝了，因為，曾經請教過醫生，據說：淡茶最容易長濕，平時是日積月累，不大感覺怎樣，只要交進濕令，喝淡茶的而是濕體，益發要發得厲害。</p>
<p>但是，喝慣茶的人，要是一天到晚滑滴水來沾唇，就好象非常難　過，而況，我又是常要到烈日下去跑跑的，汗出如瀋之後，喉嚨中更其覺著品渴，醫生關照用米仁橘紅代茶，不甚可口，並不解渴。譬如，吃白開水，似乎淡而無味，菊花和紅茶，味道也不配胃口，說也笑話，對於這小小的飲的問題，倒似乎很難解決了。</p>
<p>前年內子去買了兩瓶菓子露回來，味道是香甜，用冷開水攪和了並且非常解渴，我喝過幾時，胃口覺得開了，後來，一個夏天，什麼冷飲，都不想吃。（因為有濕的關係，吃汽水或冰淇淋，過後就要胃呆作惡的）。專門吃菓子露。大有「不可一日無此君」之概了。</p>
<p>二三年來，菓子露的好壞，可以分得很清楚，就中不攪糖精，不用生水，吃了喉間不會發幹，我信得過的在國製品中要推冠生園比較純潔些，因為，來路貨價格過貴，你要是貪便宜，就免不了有用糖精，和生水的東西買著。</p>
<p>現在，夏天又到了，雖是離　雨終索居的住在僻壞窮鄉間，在我，這蚊煙和菓露，卻少不了要早早採辦的。</p>

<p>— 王乃賡</p>
<p>亞洲　在亞洲各國食糖之產量，亦呈逐年減少之勢，去年爲三，一九〇千噸，較前年爪哇自一八九四年（五一二，四九五噸）以來，去年（五三〇，九六三噸）爲第一次之最小產量。其最大之一千曾到過三，一〇〇，〇〇〇噸之極限，存糖堆積甚多，實有減少產量之必要。印度去年因雨水不足，自亦影響生產，但年來其國內之消費減少，實爲主因，印度四年來平均每年生產不足其消費數約在二十萬左右，所以其需要減少直接影響於爪哇糖之輸入。日本與台灣因受風災，至所產糖量亦未能如所期望，其產量雖略高於消費，但因爲糖製品輸入中國，故一方仍須向爪哇進口原料。中國年來頻遭水患，國民貧苦更甚，其糖食之消費自不得不節省購買。菲律賓前年尚有增加，去年忽然減退爲六八〇千噸，較前年減少七一三千噸，超過一倍有餘！此惟一原因，蓋爲美國瓊斯與康斯丁肯法案　Janes-Costigan　Act限制所致。其他國家，反見增加。茲將亞洲各國三年來所產冰糖數量，列表如左。（單位千噸）</p>

<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>然而淋菌怎麽會竄入好好的人體呢？關於這個問題，答覆很簡單：乃是由傳染而來的。無論什麽人的身體裏，决不會自己產生淋菌。淋菌的傳染，通常由於不淸潔的性交。一個健康無病的男子倘然同患有淋病的女子發生性交之後，女子陰道內的淋菌，就會在性交的時候向男子尿道裹竄入。反之，一個健康的女子倘然同患有淋病的男子發生性交之後，男子尿道裏的淋菌，也會在性交的時候竄入女子的陰道。所以不淸潔的性交，是淋菌傳染最好的機會。百分之九十九以上的淋病，都是由不淸潔的性交傳染而來的。（未完）</p>

<p>淋病治法。有冲洗，注射，電療，內服等數種。冲洗則挿管戟痛。且有將病毒送入內部組織之危險。注射則針洞頻添。且有引起炎症之副作用。電療則不能獨當一面。仍需乞靈於藥石。內服則藥劑之選擇。非病家所熟諳。且焉庸醫誤人。劣藥害人。病未殺人。反先蒙其害矣。余本歷來臨床經騐。深知舊日一般療法。以注射黃色素為最效。但黃色素注射有色素沉着腠理及引起炎症之流弊。自最近黃色素內服劑「安敵淋」Antirrhea發明後。捨短取長。與注射黃色素有異曲同工之妙。而無其副作用之流弊。故晚近歐美醫藥兩界。莫不奉「安敵淋」為治療白濁淋病之無上權威。余歸國後亦迭經用以治愈急慢淋濁病家。奏效較任何藥品為滿意云。</p>

<p>電信特栞</p>
<h3 id="c225">請政軍機關遵守官電收現之院令 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>最近行政院規定整頓官軍電報費辦法三項：　自二十五年七月一日起，應遵照「國民政府官軍電報收費及限制辦法」嚴格執行。　通令全國軍政各樓關限制發電，私人假借機關名義濫戰電報者，應從嚴懲辦。　發電人不遵守前項辦法而强迫抬發電報者，經查明以後，由各該主管機關從嚴懲辦。上項辦法，業經通飭各機關遵照，並印發布吿張貼在案。自此官電收現，或達到圓滿目的歟？</p>
<p>查電政經費，純恃報費以資挹注，近年以來，因剿匪關係，新設錢路甚多，開支　繁，不敷甚鉅。加以官軍電欠費泰重，計自國民政府十七年建都截至二十四年年底止，積欠已達三千七百餘萬元之多！長此以往，不僅對衆通信，無無維持，卽對於軍事通信，殊難為繼。查官軍電報應儘先轉遞價目除另有規定者外，不論明碼密語，均依尋常明語電報價目减半收費。至作戰或剿匪區域之軍事電報，每一百字收材料費五角，不及一百字之數，以一百字計。經於二十三年七月國民政府頒布之官軍電報收費及限制辦法第三條第十九條分別規定，自應遵照辦理。惟以軍事迭興，餉糈竭蹶，且官電欠費，已是習慣，各政軍機關，對於發寄之官軍電報，照章付費者固多，而累催不付者亦不少。現在全國軍事政治，在最高領袖蔣先生指導之下，增加行政效率，發展交通功用，為其施政方針，較之任何時代為有力，是有成績，是以理整官軍報費，必容易實行有效，上項辦法，對於電信事業前途，實多利賴也。</p>
<p>官電收現，不僅對於電信事業有益，且對於軍政機關便利之處；亦復甚多，茲再略而言之：</p>
<p>臻進通信速率　電報功用，以速率為主。官軍電報，尤貴神速。惟電報機器容量有限，線路情形不同，故電報應力求簡短，非緊急事項，不必發寄電，報，非必要辭句，不必形之電文。換言之：少發一通不緊急事項之電報，卽所以不至擠塞緊急電報之綫路，少用不必要之一字，卽所以加速必要一字之傳遞。蔣總司令有鑒及此，會於二十一年十二月刪電豫鄂皖三省內各政軍機關及剿隊伍，對於發寄電報，嚴加限制？「以後無論任何機關發電，電文務求簡明，匪非萬難節省，不得長過一百字；非特急事件，不得濫加「限卽刻到」字樣，非緊急情事，尤應改用快郵，不應動輒發電」。蓋以濫發電報，不獨擁塞綫路，抑且貽誤要電也。務望政軍長官謹遵此旨，以免有誤事機。</p>
<p>减少電費預算　查政軍機關，每以濫發電報之故，對於每年度之預算，卽電費一項，往往因其太多，不能十足支領。今若對於所發電報遵照上項辦法，加以嚴格限制，電費已經减少。而每次所發電報，必須照章付現，則每月所需電費若干，卽可明白結淸，將來對於電費預算上不難確定，决算上不難稽核。且行政院對於官軍電報之電費，旣經通令付現，則政軍機關所頒發寄電報之電費，自可按月呈請支給，决無拖欠之虞矣。</p>
<p>政治機構之最大效率，在於運用靈活，尤在於統系不紊功令風行，今蔣院長旣以最大之决心，整理官電收費，希望各政軍機關恪遵蔣院長之意旨，努力奉行，以赴功效。增加行政效率，其在斯乎？固，不僅為電政前途着想也。</p>
<h3 id="c226">談談船舶無綫電報 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 芝</p>
<p>船舶無綫電台與海岸無綫電台或其他船舶無綫電台傳遞之電報，稱為船舶無綫電報。凡曾經交通部註册並發給船舶無綫電台執照之船舶，得自行裝置無綫電報機，與交通部所轄各海岸電台直達通報。上項船舶電台與國內各處互相往來之電報，稱為國內船舶電報。船舶電報之不合於前項規定者，為國際船舶電報，國內船舶電報係按國幣收費，每字報費係由　本境費，　海岸電台費，　船舶電台費等三項合組而成。例如現行國內船舶電台價目表內所載船舶與國內各處往來之華文明語尋常或政旋轉電報每字之本境費及海岸電台費均為一角，船舶電台費為五分，故每字總價為二角五分。華文明語加急電每字總價為三角五分。（因加急電之本境費係照尋常電之本境費加倍收取，卽加急華文明語船舶電報之本境費每字應收二角，外加海岸電台費一角船舶電台費五分，合訐為三角五分。）至國際船舶電報，係按金法郎收費，惟在國境以內得照交通部規定之金法郎折合國幣率收取國幣。其每字總價係由　船舶電台費，　海岸電台費，　國內電報綫路費，　國際電報綫路費等四項合組而成。例如船舶與香港往來電報，經由交通部海岸電台，國內陸綫或無綫電，以及國際電台直達香港無綫電路傳遞者，每字總價應收一金法郎九十生丁（但船舶如由上海或福州等處交通部海岸電台發寄香港電報，每字僅收一金法郎四十生丁，因此項電報未經國內錢路傳遞，故須减收國內電報綫路費五十生丁）。上述之金法郎電報價目，在國境以內，每一金法郎照現行折合率折合國幣一元一角四分，一金法郎四十生丁折合國幣一元六角。</p>
<p>按照現行船舶無綫電報收費規則第三條之規定，凡未經交通部註册並發給船舶無綫電台執照之船舶，如與交通部海岸電台通報，所有往來各電均應作為國際船舶電報計費。例如設有船舶無綫電台之輪船二艘，同時均由廣州拍發華文明語船舶電報至南京。其中一輪未經交通部註冊並發給船舶電台執照，則該輪所發船舶電報，照章應作為國際船舶電報，每字應收報費一金法郎四十生丁，折合國幣一元六角。倘該輪已經交通部註冊並發給執照者，則按國內船舶電報價目收費，每字祇需國幣二角五分，相差甚鉅。故凡國營或外商輪船公司可將所轄船舶先向交通部呈請註冊，請領船舶，國籍證書，一面向交通部電政司聲請塡發船舶電台執照後方可請求適用國內船舶電報價目。經過上項手續以後，每年當可節省電報費其鉅，故各輪船公司對於船舶註冊及請發船舶電台執照事項，均應照章辦理，不必稍存觀望。</p>
<p>自國內電報營業通則施行後，船舶無綫電報收費規則並無更改，所有國內華文船舶電報之收報人姓名，職銜，船名，海岸電臺名稱或住址，均應按字計　，並不　用國內電報營業通則內規定之華文電報收報人住址名稱計費辦法。例如｛劉委員　　（36）號官艙新銘　烟台｝一電之收報人姓名，　銜，船名及海岸電臺名稱應按十三字計費。至國際徵船舶電報之收報船舶電臺名稱，依照國際電報規則第十九條第一二兩節之規定，應准連接書寫。例如：｛Captain　Watson，　Chinaexportetxnhs｝一電內之Chinaexporterxnhs，為華達輪船之英文船名及船舶電臺呼號。該項收報船舶電臺名稱，不論字數多寡，可作一字計費。但電文內如有船舶名稱連書一起，經證明確係船名無誤者，在洋文明語船舶電報內，每字以十五個字母為限，逾此加一字計費。電文如係暗語，每字至多以五個字母為限。除國際船舶暗電報，准照暗語六折計費外，國內洋文暗語電報係按全價收費，並不减成收取。例如Prefidentjackson在洋文明語電內應按二字計費，在暗語電內則按四字收費。船舶電報之發報人，對於上述計費辦法，似宜相當注意，以免誤會。</p>

<p>東西兩段均已開放通話</p>
<p>京漢兩地相距約一二一五公里，其間九江，蕪湖，為華中商業文化之中心，南昌，懷寗，為政治軍事之重鎭。故交通部九省長途電話工程以京漢幹綫最為重要。該項工程，經年餘之努力，據悉現已建設完成，除以中間局帮電設借正在裝設，不久卽能作京漢直達通話外，所有西段漢口南昌九江間，曁東段南昌，九江，懷寗，蕪湖，南京相互間，均已先後開放通話。茲將通話日期，及其價目，探誌於左：</p>

<h3 id="c231">新少年第一卷展望 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 王健三</p>
<p>接到最近一期的「新少年」，後面附有一卷總目的索引，知道「新少年」出版至今巳有半年，時光過的眞快啊！</p>
<p>讀了半年的「新少年」，當此一卷巳完而二卷將要開始的時候，我想把這過去的一卷的略來談幾句，不算批評，聊作讀後感而已。</p>
<p>平心而論，現在的雜誌眞不少，但要找一本適合高小及初中學生程度閱讀的，似乎除了「新少年」以外是沒有了。雖然可以說，這是我的見識不多的緣故，但切合道種程度的刋物不多，誰也不能吾認的。</p>
<p>我以為雜誌與敎科書不同，敎科書的材料是死的，沒有時閒關係的，而雜誌則不然，必須將最新的材料刋入，才是道理。現在一般的學生閱讀的雜誌，除了載一些合於時令的動物植物以外，其他是不管了。「新少年」則不然，除了適合時令的動植物一類的文章而外，像「平流層探險記」「法國馬其諾要塞」「世界第一大郵船曼麗皇后號」「空中宮殿興登堡號」「六月十九日太陽全蝕」等等，都是有時間關係的「新」的「少年」的材料。關於動物植物適於時令的文章，今年不刋登而明後年還是合用的，但像「新少年」上的上述諸題，留在明年刋登或是下半年刊登都就失去了時效，所以「新少年」的編者，能够注意到這一個「新」字，這是其他雜誌所不及的。其他材料也不像別種刊刋物的「拉在籃中便是菜」的毫不選擇，比方像瓦特的二百年紀念來講瓦特，巴符洛夫逝世了便介紹巴符洛夫的學說，蘇俄鬧着「史太哈諾夫運動」時來介紹史太哈諾夫的歷史，鋁發明了五十年紀念來講鋁，不像其他刊物的編者，今天有了瓦特的材料講瓦特，明夭有了愛因斯坦的傳記就刊登愛因斯坦的歷史，彷彿敎科書，第三課的材料移到第五第十都不妨事一樣。這又是「新少年」雜誌勝過其他雜誌的地方。</p>
<p>平常，在朋友處，聽到批評雜誌的話不少，有許多人公認「新少年」出刋之後，給與其他少年讀物的影響不少，所以有幾種雜誌，不僅編排方面有許多地方慕仿了「新少年」，就是內容方面，也有不少的地方摹仿着，比方：聖陶先生的文章展覽，現在有幾種少年讀物，也來添此一欄了；逸文先生的少年閱報室，現在有許多少年讀物也有此一攔了。但是，這是表面的模仿，而內容的精審，選得遜於「新少年」一籌。</p>
<p>關於文藝方面的材料，其他雜誌大都刋登些貓哥哥狗弟弟的材料。這種材料，祇是迎合兒童的低級趣味，實際是毫無意義的，新少年雜誌上便沒有這一類材料。雖然也會刋有聖陶先生的「烏言獸語」，可是鳥獸語，决不像貓哥哥狗弟弟同樣的無聊，所以我們不能相提並論的。至於像聖陶先生的「鄰居」，指示着一般人盲目仇外的失妥；茅盾先生的「少年印刷工」，指不着少年人對於職業的正常觀念，這都是其他刋物上所見不到的東西。</p>
<p>中國是科學落後的國家，所以普通學生閱讀的雜誌，對於科學，祗刋些遊戲的材料。「新少年」又不如此，科學遊戲和科學趣味，僅當補白材料，像第八期上的「動物趣談」，第九期上的「磁針的水上競技」等，祗是補白而已。至於其他，每期終有二三篇的科學文章，或是生物學方面的，或是物理化學方面的，不僅作學理的說明，而且還有實騐的方法。我想，假使其他許多雜誌，科學方面也像「新少年」一樣的努力，那麼中國的科學雖然落後，學生們見到科學的功課，也就不會感到頭痛了。</p>
<p>這一卷「新少年」，雖祇有薄薄的十二册，然而材料十分豐富，排印很是經濟，决沒有浪費一點紙面的地方，而且除了第一期以外，大都用五號字排的，至於像「新少年講座」，到後來竟用六號字排印了。這樣，省出的篇幅，多刋一二篇文章，在讀者方面，十分合宜的。我們以頁數講，或許別種的兒童刋物要多些；但以字數論，則「新少年」要比其他的兒童讀物多出一倍或二倍。</p>
<p>我並不是一味的恭維「新少年」，新少年雜誌中的缺點自然也免不掉，比方內中有幾篇文章，內容比較欠充實，像「上海虹口小菜塲」，沒有將菜塲的管理情形寫出來，　不出菜商受到壓迫的苦痛，我以為文章僅做了表面而沒有寫入內心；「上海靜安寺廟會」，沒有多大的社會背景；「關於中國旅行劇團」是大半空話而有些像旅行劇團的廣吿文章，這些都不能不算是一點小疵。可是，一本雜誌，編纂很不容易，要求完全無缺，事實上不大容易做到，我在旁邊說幾句風凉括似乎有些缺德。但是，我們以讀者的態度，正不妨向之苛求一些；雖然我們明知道新少年雜誌之優點，這些小疵算不得什麽。</p>
<p>因為「新少年」是現在中國一切少年刋物的權威，所以我除將第一卷的內容在前面大略一說而外，現在再來說幾句希望第二卷的話。</p>
<p>當然，對於第二卷，希望保持着上述的優點，革除了上述的小疵；內容方面，希望再增些材料，像子愷先生的「美術故事」，談了圖畫，最好再來談談音樂；還有國際動盪的情形，像「阿比西尼亞」，「希脫拉的續命湯」，這一類的文章最好每期有一二篇。至於出版方面，能够提早出版更好；因為我們讀者，一册新雜誌讀完之後，立刻又盼望着下一册的早早出刋。我想，這點希望，也許有許多人和我相同吧！</p>
<p>展開一卷十二期「新少年」的編輯後記一讀，知道編者也正在努力於第二卷的改革，啊，好吧，我就不必再說了，我希望「新少年」永遠是一般少年刋物的領袖！</p>
<h3 id="c232">為什麼寫「哲學的復活」？ <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 林柷敔</p>
<p>「哲學的復活」　開明書店出版　實價三角五分</p>
<p>要是無論什麼人，手裏拿了本哲學書在讀，給人家看見了，一定要說：「啊唷，眞看不出你，做起哲學家來了！」這是一個很普通的實在的事，我時常遇到的。我們會味這句話，可以得到兩層意思。</p>
<p>第一，哲學一向被視作神聖不可近的東西，說牠滿是荘嚴的文字，莫明其妙的理諭，我們要去讀，猶似用手去觸刺蝟一樣，不能有好的結果：因此，研究哲學的人，都被視作為三頭六臂的神祇，有超人之力；或者是帶着老光眼鏡滿蓄鬍子的老學者，說一句話人家要費半點鐘的光陰才能了解。當然囉，說前面一句話的人，含蓄着諷刺的成分，譏笑你在空擺架子，哲學家是一千年也做不成功的。</p>
<p>第二，二十世的今日，科學特別發達，好像非到人人做了科學家不肯罷休。哲學有什麽意思？有什麽用處？老是些不關痛癢的字句，意義也像在雲霧裹，曖昧懵懂，不能把握。因此，你看哲學是根本落伍，你所遭到的苦相，像理科生走過文科生餉以白眼一般。</p>
<p>這是正確的說法。哲學一向是似乎很深奧的，你不妨隨意傘一本哲學書，一看牠的厚度，就可證明了。說用語深刻，也是不可吾認的，凡是翻譯過哲學書都覺得困難，好像「理知」，「理性」，「良知」，「理念」，「實念」，「觀念」，「概念」，「意象」，「意識」，「意志」……老是翻來覆去地使用着，看得多了自然會頭昏腦漲。致於說哲學已落伍了，事實上是對的：科學上的地心引力可以做斜面，哲學上的觀念有什麽用處？哲學彷彿是毫無用處的東西了。不過，再是個不過，哲學是要的，我們每個人都要看上幾冊哲學書；哲學不難的，我們讀了牠，有吃橄欖似的回味，而且一咬就碎，非常容易。我心中相信這種說法，就起了耍寫「哲學的複活」一書的動機，以證我言之不謬。我有下面幾個目的：</p>
<p>1「開明靑年業書」內，別的都有，就缺乏那末一種哲學著作，未免不足，所以我就寫了「哲學的復活」，來塡滿這個空擋，使一般靑年或任何讀者有嘗哲學一臠的機會。初讀的或已讀而不明的，「概論」的性質最適宜，「哲學的復活」就是有「概論」的性質：牠裏面已包括了所有重要的哲學問題，每個問題都充分伏下暗示路線，可俾以後研究起來有所綱領可提挈。但本書與其他ABC或概論之類不同：（一）本書雖是槪諭，但在一般介紹之後，殿以公平的批判，使讀者不教起思想上的徬徨，最後提出作者的主張，這個主張是扶助的，决不干涉其他派別的意見，猶似錦上添花一般，讀者可隨意取捨：這種體裁，別書恐怕沒有。（二）本書與其他書不同之點，因本書中更有哲舉史的記載，哲學史很是重要，可知每個派別思想形成的經過，推源溯本，歷歷在目；這在槪論的書中是忽略了的；故本畫可當哲學概論讀，又可當哲學史讀，兩者俱備，了解更深，作高中哲學選課敎本是很適宜的。（三）本書有中國哲學精確的解剖叙述，我們普通的哲學書大都偏於西洋哲學，中國哲學不得而知，誠是個極悲慘的現象；如讀了本書，明瞭西洋哲學後，中國哲學也有寬大的問津之路，作敎本更是適宜，普通讀也須要。</p>
<p>2哲學的內容在本書中使牠變成非常容易，因為本書的主張是，「沒有哲學，只有人生哲學」。哲學所以會深奧起來，因是專門在那兩個宇宙論與認識論上瞎　所致；本書主張寗願廢棄宇宙論與認識論，而在人生論上用珈，人生論是人人經過的事，涵義簡單，人人須要明白，如果這樣，哲學不是重復使人歡喜，不是「復活」了嗎？話雖這末說，本書仍使宇宙論與認識論有很好的地位，透澈的論斷，使讀者仍有必要的固有的知識。</p>
<p>3本書用字力求簡潔，故一本薄薄的書中，包括所有問題，但不使之「大綱化」；而在了解上非常容易，决無其他哲學書用字累贅不明之弊，一讀之後，可打倒從來視讀哲學為長途的心理；此外，常常引用體貼的例子，以加强印象，但决不使例子與本義混淆，致使失去眞義，像目下一二本通俗哲學那樣，例子有喧賓奪主之槪。</p>
<p>4哲學與科學有很多聯帶關係，讀科學的人應該讀哲學，像天文學是形上學的轉化，化學解决生命之組織，都須知道；因此本書就把科學與哲學混合起來，使讀科學的與哲學發生學問上的聯鎖，使讀哲學的知道科學的眞義。這實是求學上很好的方法，不可偏面，而須化合，讀本書自可領略所有學問的槪况及其關係，並且，决不會視哲學為無用之物，反之，倒有帮助各種科學的能力。</p>
<p>末了，本書出版前，會作精確的校正，决無錯字發生；又使定價極低（只三角半，特價期內七折），可使購買便宜；都是作者很高興的事。</p>

<p>自敎部頒布敎科　書及其他　　　一出售辦法的訓令後，上海市書　　業公會集議多次，决定於本日起實行。開明書店除將敎科書减價　售外，並將繁銷的好書，减低售價，博得普遍購買，這也是讀書界的好消息。</p>

<h3 id="c234">弱者的出路 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>貧病交迫是資本社會每個勞働者的共同命運。</p>
<p>在這共同的命運裏，橫在他們面前的路祗有兩條：强者艇而走險；弱者被無形的鐵鍊鎖着，永遠地受着磨折，或者，受不了長期的磨折，便祇有用自己的手來結束自己的生命：而那些受着磨折者呢，結果也因為禁不了磨折，——祇有一條路：死。</p>
<p>再不然，自已故意犯了一些「罪」，讓關到牢裏去，不必費心地得到一份無法想像的衣，食，住。然而這結果又是什麽呢？無情的歲月像水一般的流去，頭上的黑髮換上了白髮，結果也是死。他們較之自殺者，雖然延長了一些呌做「壽命」的這個東西，然而他們也正是呌肉體多受一些苦楚。</p>
<p>一個受着苦楚的饑寒交迫者，他如果甘願受着那份苦楚，永遠在泥坑中討着生活，在他的面前沒有一個崇高的理想的話，那麼我以為，他還不如雲死比較來得合算些。一個聽憑人家宰割，鞭撻像在臭泥坑中過着豬一樣的辰光，這難道也可以算做「生活」嗎？</p>
<p>人雖然不能儘靠着「理想」過日子，然而也不能沒有「理想」。——如果所想的事情是永遠沒有實現的可能的，那麽這是「幻想」，不是「理想」，理想是根據現實的出發的。</p>
<p>然而受着饑寒交迫中的弱者，所普遍缺乏的似乎就是這個，或者，他們雖有「理想」，却把「理想」建築在別人身上。他仍渴想着生活「變」得比現在美滿些，然而他們不敢向「生活」去搏鬥。（請想一想！誰使他們「生活」像現在這個樣子的呢？）他們想由人家把他們的生活改善，然後由他們來享受。</p>
<p>（世界上自然沒有這樣的事情。）</p>
<p>舉一個例吧：一個在鋼鐵廠做學徒的十六歲的靑年自殺了，他給他胞兄的遺書中便這樣寫着，「今我四人之中，全靠我兄爭氣，為父母復仇，望勿悲傷</p>
<p>他把「復仇」的希望建築在他的哥哥身上，而自己却怯弱地自殺了，並且還呌他的哥哥不要悲傷。像每個「弱者」的行為一樣。</p>
<p>這樣，除了「死」，「弱者」便永遠找不到他們的出路。因為他們旣不敢對「生活」作堅苦的搏鬥，而「生活」又不會對他們放鬆一步。</p>
<p>弱者的出路在那裹呢？我要大聲的問不敢和「生活」搏鬥的人們。難道，果眞祗有「死」是你們的出路嗎？</p>

<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>（我想在寂寞的時候，寫下一點有趣的鴿子的故事吧。）</p>
<p>在孩子時，那一個瞎眼的二舅是我有趣的伴侶。晚上我同大姊和哥哥們在園子裹放上幾把竹椅子，大家都捉對兒的坐着，做拍大麥的兒戲或是數着滿天的星子；因為我在他們中間是最小的一個，所以他們常合夥兒去開我自管自地去玩。這樣，我只有同那孤另地坐着的瞎眼二舅說得上，聽着他有趣地說着螢火蟲和兎子們的故事，常使我忘了他們—大姊和哥哥們，憧憬着故事里有趣的事物。</p>
<p>瞎眼二舅曾吿訴我有趣的鴿子的故事，在我的心中也與奮和憧憬着的，那有趣的故事是塗上紅色和藍色的；瞎眼二舅是叙述他蓄養鸽子的經歷，常時我記得他一味地笑着，常年害着的眼睛眯成了一條縫，下顎顫顫地說着話：</p>
<p>「養鴿子才有趣呢，隔着幾百里的路程，它們也仍認得老家（註）的。」</p>

There are rumors that Han will make further statements on the situation in the Southwest, but I believe that in this time of great national crisis, we only seek the realization of Ma's proposals and have no other opinions. I am not aware of the rumored security organization in North China. Regarding the joint proposal with Han for the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, we did have such a plan, but the proposal has not yet been drafted. I fear I will be unable to attend the Second Plenary Session. Regarding the incident of misunderstanding between the Japanese army and our garrison in Fengtai, both sides are currently making every effort to explain the misunderstanding and investigate the matter. As reports from various parties differ, it will be handled according to law after verification. I have not received any reports of disturbances in Inner Mongolia.

<p>— Bin</p>
<p>I remember an American journalist once said, "France always sees the world through a German prism." Indeed, as in the case of the British proposal to lift sanctions against Italy, the French new cabinet originally indicated disapproval. However, it was ultimately forced to agree. The important reason for this was the fear of offending Italy, thereby causing her to combine with Germany to oppress France. Similarly, Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos recently announced foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies, putting forward two key points of the collective security system: all countries neighboring aggressor nations must do their utmost to resist the aggressor nation; and all other member states of the League of Nations must implement economic and financial sanctions against the aggressor nation. Isn't this so-called aggressor nation an implicit reference to Germany?</p>
<p>France is a weary and content nation. It fears German retaliation and only wants to maintain the status quo and peace. France's post-war foreign policy has always been based on "security guarantees," preventing German aggression at every turn. Poincaré, Briand, Barthou, Laval, and Flandin all acted in this way. For this, France was willing to cooperate with socialist Russia, join hands with its longtime enemy Italy, and form broad alliances to encircle Germany.</p>
<p>However, Germany has now grown strong again. The security guarantees created by France after the war have lost their effectiveness. The League of Nations, chaired by France, has been severely hit by Hitler and Mussolini. Poland has thrown itself into Germany's arms. The Little Entente appears to be gradually estranged due to Nazi instigation. The so-called "Stresa Front" has also collapsed. Italian aid is unreliable, and the relationship between Britain and France is giving Hitler an opportunity. At present, only the Franco-Soviet Pact remains as France's sole guarantee.</p>
<p>In this isolated diplomatic situation, the work of the French new cabinet is indeed extremely arduous. It is impossible to be pro-German because Hitler's ambition to expand outward is growing ever stronger, and there is no possibility of reconciling the interests of the two countries. Italy, while not becoming an enemy, cannot be a good friend. Moreover, the recent rapprochement between Italy and Germany (according to a Havas report on the 24th, the Italian Air Force's visit to Berlin suggests a possible alliance forming a fascist front) has added a layer of separation to Italian-French friendship. Even after France decided to lift sanctions against Italy, Italian newspapers still greeted the decision with cold laughter and ridicule. From this, it can be seen that the friendly period of the Rome Accords has passed. As for Britain, it has never wanted France to dominate the fate of Europe and harbors some resentment towards the emerging socialist government. Moreover, for the sake of revising the League of Nations covenant this time, Britain and France may inevitably face rifts. In such a gloomy diplomatic climate, how will the Blum cabinet break through the diplomatic difficulties?</p>
<p>The Blum cabinet, adhering to the foreign policy guidelines of the Popular Front, believes that peace is indivisible and security is collective. France must seek its own security while also seeking peace for Europe. Therefore, when Blum announced foreign policy in the Senate on the 23rd, he first proposed concluding regional pacts to promote a collective security system. The French new cabinet believes that to break through the current difficulties, it must strengthen the forces of peace, expand the Franco-Soviet Pact to all peace-loving countries, and unite all peace-loving countries. Only in this way can the lines between aggressors and forces of peace be clearly defined, France's security be guaranteed, and the aggressor's ambitions be curbed. However, this is a difficult and arduous task that the gentlemen of the Quai d'Orsay must ponder deeply.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) When the Legislative Yuan reviewed the General Budget Bill for National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 25th year of the Republic of China, Chen Changheng, acting chairman of the Finance Committee, reported on the review process. Chen first stated the circumstances under which the central government approved and finalized the general budget for the 25th year. He then explained the reasons for increasing or decreasing the figures listed for each item of revenue and expenditure. Finally, he said that although the bill was submitted to the Yuan in a hurry, the five committees were still able to achieve rapid success in the review work because the detailed figures for each item had been separately approved by the central government. After Chen's report, the chairman sought the opinions of the various committees, and there were no objections. The bill was passed smoothly, and the Legislative Yuan immediately submitted it to the National Government for promulgation on the 1st. (30th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Review Report of the Two Committees</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The five committees of the Legislative Yuan reviewed the General Budget Bill for National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 25th year of the Republic of China and submitted a report to the presidents of the Sun and Ye Yuans. The original text of the report stated that the General Budget Bill for National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 25th year of the Republic of China was ordered by the Yuan on June 26 of this year to be submitted to the Finance Committee together with the Legal System, Foreign Affairs, Economic Affairs, and Military Affairs committees for expedited review. It was ordered to be completed and submitted to the Yuan meeting for discussion before June 30, along with the attached documents. The case was approved by the central government, with revenue and expenditure each at 99,065,845 yuan. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics compiled the National General Budget Bill for the 25th year in accordance with the approved budget estimates and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Yuan for review. According to the previous order, the committees convened a joint meeting on June 29 to discuss the bill, with representatives from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Yang Rumei and Ouyang Baozhen, in attendance to provide explanations. It was immediately resolved that the bill was compiled based on the budget estimates approved by the Central Political Committee, and all detailed estimates of revenue and expenditure were separately approved. Therefore, the bill should be passed as is. Is this appropriate? The report and attached documents are hereby submitted for review and approval, and for submission to the Yuan meeting for public decision. (30th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Original Dispatch from the Executive Yuan Requesting Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original dispatch from the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan requesting review of the General Budget Bill for National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 25th year of the Republic of China stated that the National Government instructed the Executive Yuan that the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics reported on June 17 that the Central Political Committee forwarded the government's instructions to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, requesting that the General Budget Estimates for National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 25th year be reviewed. After forwarding the special projects to the meeting, they were submitted to the Finance Special Committee for joint review. It was then reported that the original revenue and expenditure were each listed at 100,156,584.5 yuan. While the revenue and expenditure appeared to be balanced on the surface, the revenue portion increased by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics included 180 million yuan in debt income, 10 million yuan in net profit from state-owned enterprises, and 12 million yuan in unified taxes. The actual difference between revenue and expenditure was over 200 million yuan. Based on the current national financial and socio-economic situation, efforts should be made to balance revenue and expenditure to consolidate the credit of the legal tender. The 11 budget standards for the 25th year, submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Central Committee, should be used as the basis for reviewing expenditure. Therefore, it was decided to review expenditure based on three principles: recurring expenses should not be increased from the previous year's approved budget; newly established agencies should be postponed unless necessary; and temporary expenses should not be listed unless necessary. Subsequently, meetings were held continuously to review and reduce the various items of expenditure, while the construction expenses specified in the budget standards were still listed. The total estimated expenditure was 99,065,845 yuan. The various tax revenues originally listed in the revenue portion were inevitably too high. The Ministry of Finance is currently working to rigorously combat smuggling, rectify old taxes, and implement new taxes, which may not be difficult to achieve. It is proposed that the revenue from net profits of state-owned enterprises be increased by 30 million yuan, and the revenue from debt income be 125 million yuan, for a total estimated revenue of 99,065,845 yuan, in order to balance revenue and expenditure. The 25th year National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure General Budget Book and Expenditure Classification Table are attached. Kong Xiangxi and others were appointed to convene a meeting to discuss the matter. As a result of the discussion, it was considered that the sole purpose of finance at present was to consolidate the credit of legal tender and maintain the balance of revenue and expenditure. The Finance Special Committee followed this principle and considered both the standards set by the Executive Yuan, striving to increase construction and reduce consumption. The minimum expenses required by the central party and government agencies were based on the old amount from previous years, with some slight increases in order to leave room for administrative flexibility. The overall figures were allocated and seemed appropriate. It is proposed that the case be approved, with revenue and expenditure each at 99,065,845 yuan, and sent to the government for legal compilation and promulgation of the general budget. However, the time is too short, and it is proposed that the government issue a general order to execute it first. The attached documents are sent with this order. The matter was submitted to the 15th meeting of the committee and resolved that the 25th year National Ordinary General Budget Estimate should be approved and sent to the National Government. In response, the approved 25th year National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure General Estimate and Expenditure Classification Table are attached for reference. Upon receiving this instruction, all officials immediately worked overnight to compile the Draft General Budget Book for National Ordinary Revenue and Expenditure for the 25th year. In order to clarify the contents of each item, the approved General Estimate Book and Classification Table, as well as the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics' percentage ratio table for revenue and expenditure, the comparison table of the estimated expenditure and the original listed amount, the proposed remedial opinion book, and the original second-level estimate books submitted by the competent authorities are attached for submission to the Executive Yuan for submission to the Legislative Yuan for review and promulgation according to law. This instruction was issued, stating "All submitted documents have been received. Await instructions to submit them to the Executive Yuan for review. This instruction," in addition to being printed and distributed, all attached documents are submitted to the Executive Yuan with this order, instructing the Yuan to review and handle them promptly. This instruction was submitted to the 268th meeting of the Executive Yuan and passed. The relevant attached documents are submitted to your Yuan for review. (30th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pi-lian told reporters on the 30th that the Communist bandits in Shanxi have been eliminated, and local security has returned to its original state. Director Yan is now working hard to handle all the aftermath. Due to busy military and political affairs, he may not be able to come to Nanjing to attend the Second Plenary Session. Yan's attitude towards the current situation is that the national crisis in China is serious, and the whole country should take unified steps, and must not be divided or alienated, so as to reduce the national strength and create opportunities for others. As for the dispatch of troops by the two Guangdongs this time, he telegraphed to the authorities of the two Guangdongs, earnestly advising them to put the nation and the people first. There have long been rumors of unusual movements in Suiyuan and Mongolia. As for the truth, because there will be an official report at the meeting, the successor of the Chairman of the Chahar-Suiyuan Mongol Local Autonomous Political Affairs Committee and League Chief of the Xilingol League, So Wang, who has passed away, is currently being considered for appointment by the central government.

<h3 id="e18">Wang Yong-bin Discusses Recent Work of the Ministry of Justice <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Justice Wang Yongbin discussed that the central work of the ministry in the past year has been to implement the new trial system nationwide, reform the principles of justice and the judicial system, reduce overcrowding in prisons, reduce detention in detention centers, and clear accumulated cases in various courts, with new cases being concluded as soon as they arrive. Regarding the first point, in addition to supervising and ordering the provinces implementing the new system to strengthen their organizations, we have repeatedly ordered the eight provinces that have been delayed to make thorough preparations, lest the preparations are not complete. Fortunately, Sichuan has added three higher branch courts and reorganized two, and added more than ten district courts. Guizhou has added two higher branch courts and three district courts. Yunnan has added one higher branch court and three district courts. Suiyuan has added one higher branch court and one district court. Qinghai has too few counties under its jurisdiction and does not need to add higher branch courts, but it has added one district court in Ledu. These five poor and remote provinces have all worked hard to prepare and implement the new system as scheduled. In addition, there are higher and district courts in the provincial capital of Xinjiang. Xinjiang has only one district court for thousands of miles, and it has been ordered to add higher branch courts to facilitate appeals by the people. Due to the lack of funds and personnel, it has not been possible to rush the preparations. As for Guangdong and Guangxi, they had already made full preparations, but the Southwest Government suddenly ordered them to postpone the implementation, probably because Article 21 of the Court Organization Law stipulates that the Supreme Court shall be located in the seat of the National Government. Once the new system is implemented, the so-called Supreme Branch Court will not be able to exist. Why preserve this unfounded branch court and make the national laws inconsistent? This is incomprehensible. Therefore, only five of the eight provinces have actually implemented the new system, which is very regrettable. The fact that the county magistrate also handles judicial affairs has not been improved for more than ten years, resulting in the fact that the facts of the cases in the first instance are not understood, and all hope to have the verdicts reversed in the second and third instances. Therefore, there are many appeals and heavy burdens. The Ministry of Justice believes that unless we engage in the reorganization of the first instance, our country's judiciary will never be clear, and decided to first establish the Regulations for the Organization of County Judicial Offices. On April 24, we ordered all provinces to prepare to reorganize the county judicial offices in three phases starting from July 1 this year, with each phase not exceeding six months. It is estimated that by the end of next year, the malpractice of the county magistrate concurrently handling judicial affairs in these more than 1,400 counties can be eliminated. In the past two months, more than ten provinces have formulated plans and complied with the reorganization in phases. The provinces of Shandong, Hubei, and Gansu have decided to correct all the county judicial offices in the province starting from July 1. The local administrative authorities and judicial officials are particularly courageous in reforming, but it is also sufficient to show that the concurrent system has been criticized by the world, and they only fear that it will not be eliminated quickly. The overcrowding in prisons and detention centers everywhere is unbearable, and dredging is an urgent problem. The purpose of execution in prison is reformation. If there is evidence of repentance, why wait for the completion of the sentence? Although the criminal law stipulates conditions for parole, it is still too strict. Therefore, we proposed special measures to dredge prisons, which were effective for six months, from July 25 last year to January 15 this year, and about 15,000 people were released. As for the dredging of detention centers, there are many methods stipulated in the law, but the judges are not responsible, and they arbitrarily detain people. In addition, the lawsuits are crowded and delayed, and the pain is even worse. The Ministry of Justice repeatedly warned them to carefully detain people, and those who have been detained should be released quickly if they are eligible for bail. In the past year, due to the large number of courts and the increase in criminal cases, the number of people detained has decreased significantly compared to the past. The large number of accumulated cases and the suffering of lawsuits have been called for by the whole country. Since November last year, we have set a deadline of six months to clear all accumulated cases nationwide, and use the results of clearing accumulated cases as the standard for annual performance appraisal. At the same time, we will compare and list the total number of cases received and concluded by each court each month and publish them in the Judicial Monthly. As of the end of April, the number of pending cases in courts at all levels was 22,855 civil cases and 11,223 criminal cases. If the average is calculated for 379 courts, then each court has no more than 60 civil cases and no more than 30 criminal cases. The prosecutor's office has only a few cases per court. These pending cases are either complicated and cannot be concluded quickly, or there are unexpected obstacles and are suspended according to law. Most of the accumulated cases have been cleared, and new cases have been concluded quickly, and there are no cases that have been accumulated for more than a year or several years.

<p>French North Africa, Algiers, Constantine: The incident that occurred in this city and the ports of Oran and Wunchai Iron Mine yesterday has caused some anxiety throughout Algiers. However, the authorities have taken the necessary measures to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. The reason for the incident in these places is due to the dissatisfaction of the natives with the current situation. There are several reasons that can be said: Some Arabs have failed to understand European modern political theories. Since the outbreak of anti-Jewish disturbances by Palestinian Arabs, the natives here have also been stimulated. Economic depression and a large number of unemployed people. However, observers believe that no less than 10 million Arabs in Algiers have received political training and will never allow a small number of rioters to disrupt the local government. The government authorities have also taken all necessary measures to maintain law and order. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to hold a special meeting today to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and is expected to focus on canceling sanctions against Italy. Before the meeting, a crowd gathered outside the door to watch the representatives arrive. The most eye-catching figure was the Emperor of Abyssinia, who drove to the League of Nations headquarters at 5 pm today. The Emperor personally led the delegation to attend the meeting and planned to appeal to the audience that Abyssinia was invaded by Italy for no reason, and that the member states of the League of Nations should continue to implement sanctions against Italy for the sake of justice. The general public believes that the Emperor's appeal may not be approved by the audience. It is an unprecedented event in the history of the League of Nations for a head of state to personally address the League of Nations Assembly. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to open tomorrow afternoon. Dignitaries from all countries will gather, and there will be a lively scene with much discussion. The most eye-catching of the representatives of various countries is the Emperor of Abyssinia, who will attend in person as the head of state to advocate for Abyssinia and will request the League of Nations to provide financial assistance so that he can return to Gor, western Abyssinia, to call on his people to continue to resist the invading country. In addition, the speeches to be delivered by French Prime Minister Léon Blum and British Foreign Secretary Eden are also of great interest to the general public. The drafts of the two speeches have been prepared and will be reviewed together tonight to finalize them. Chilean representative Rivas Vicuña will then take the floor after the representatives of Britain and France to express his country's views on the issue of amending the Covenant of the League of Nations, and will request that this issue be included in the agenda of this meeting. Regarding this matter, Rivas Vicuña met with French Foreign Minister Delbos this morning to explain that he did not want to hinder the actions of the League of Nations, so if the proposed amendment to the Covenant cannot be done in fact, the wording of the Covenant may be slightly revised. Other representatives believe that the hopes of the League of Nations have been greatly shaken by the blow of the Italian-Abyssinian issue and that it is necessary to find ways to strengthen it in the future. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations are showing a more optimistic view of the development of the situation and the opening of the League of Nations Assembly. Belgian Prime Minister Jilin will arrive at noon tomorrow to preside over the opening of the Assembly and will submit the Italian note for reading. According to Italian sources, this note contains a compromise nature and explains that the Abyssinian government has been plotting to invade Italian territory for a year, which is the reason why Italy had to use force. During the Italian army's operations, they sought to reduce casualties as much as possible, so the result was that there was very little bloodshed and they finally conquered the entire Abyssinia. It also said that the areas occupied by the Italian army have been in a state of anarchy, with bandits rampant and the people living in misery. Italy is now going to reform them. The League of Nations will be notified of the detailed situation regarding the future administrative organization of these areas. In the past, all countries competed to engage in colonization, and all conquered and managed culturally backward areas as colonies. What Italy is doing now is the same. Moreover, from a legal point of view, the system of imitating Abyssinia is actually a voluntary trusteeship system, knowing that the responsibility is not light and the burden is heavy, but still not hesitating to accept it is nothing more than for the sake of the future of civilization. In addition, the Italian note is said to have put forward two major guarantees to the League of Nations, namely that Italy will never train native troops within the territory of the annexed land, and will only organize small police forces. In terms of economy, it will adopt the principle of open door and welcome foreign free investment. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The former chairman of the League of Nations Assembly, namely Czech President Beneš, recently sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, resigning from the position of chairman of the Assembly, saying that he was sorry for not being able to come to preside over the opening of the Assembly as the President of the Czech Republic, and that "I have always been optimistic about the future of the League of Nations. Although the League of Nations is now encountering difficulties, my views are still not affected." (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Czech President Benes officially resigned from the chairmanship of the League of Nations Assembly today. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with French Prime Minister Blanc and decided to nominate Belgian Prime Minister Jilin as the candidate chairman, and decided that if the organization of the League of Nations needs to be reformed, it should be implemented in September so that the League of Nations can be universalized within the current time and that the United States, Japan, Germany, Brazil and other countries can also participate. (National telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday, it was rumored here that the opening date of the League of Nations Assembly in September might be postponed to October or even later than October in order to deal with the issue after receiving Germany's reply on the Locarno issue. For a time, all parties were greatly surprised, but Britain and France claimed that the delay of the meeting by eight or ten days was only for convenience and for no other reason.

<p>(London) According to sources in Geneva, the governments of Britain and France have agreed not to negotiate with Italy on the future system of Abyssinia at this time, but to discuss it at the regular meeting of the League of Nations Assembly in September. Diplomatic circles here have expressed doubts about this news, saying that the British government has repeatedly asked the Italian government what its views are on the future system of Abyssinia. The purpose of this is nothing more than to make the country make some concessions to the League of Nations in order to resolve the issue. Italy has replied that it cannot make any concessions as long as the sanctions are not lifted. Now that there is no problem in lifting the sanctions, this issue should be considered quickly, because this issue must be resolved from the following two points of view. The two points of view are that all parties still hope that when discussing the future system of Abyssinia, the League of Nations should participate in it to some extent in order to protect part of the dignity of the League of Nations. The interests of all related countries in Abyssinia cannot be delayed. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed observers here believe today that Britain is clearly willing to cooperate with Italy again, even at the expense of Germany's friendship. Prime Minister Baldwin said in the House of Commons today that once normalcy is restored, the Admiralty has approved naval personnel of the Mediterranean Fleet to take leave. It is said that the pro-German sentiment of the British people is gradually cooling. Last week, Secretary of War Cooper's speech in Paris revealed a warning to Germany. Today, Interior Minister Simon stated that Cooper's speech did not represent the government's policy, but Germany has felt uneasy. (National telegram on the 29th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Today, the Italian government will submit a memorandum to the President of the League of Nations General Assembly. The document compares Italy's current activities in Abyssinia with those carried out under the mandate system of the Treaty of Versailles. It deems the League of Nations' accusations against Italy improper and affirms Italy's intention to utilize the Abyssinian people's will. The document states that Italy will maintain an open-door policy in East Africa and is prepared to act within the League of Nations in the spirit of European cooperation, but only after the lifting of sanctions and the disbandment of self-defense groups formed as a result of the sanctions. Italy believes that genuine cooperation cannot be achieved without mutual trust. The document further declares that the rumor that Italy proposed so-called voluntary trusteeship over Abyssinia is a major misunderstanding. Italy clearly wishes to report its civilizing efforts in Abyssinia to the League of Nations, but this does not imply any form of governance. (30th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Rome) Today's government gazette announced that the Italian army in East Africa will undergo a large-scale demobilization. This is because the Italian army's occupation of Abyssinia was very swift, and the Abyssinian people have largely submitted. Therefore, the government will prioritize the return of the troops that were first sent to East Africa. (29th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Italian government's decision to recall the "Gavina" Division of the army from western Abyssinia, a correspondent from "Le Petit Parisien" in Rome reported yesterday that this move is a response to the Abyssinian Emperor's statement that it is not certain whether the Italian army can conquer Abyssinia. It is also meant to demonstrate that western Abyssinia no longer requires a large army to be stationed there, and that a small number of troops performing police duties is sufficient. Italian sources believe that this move will create a good impression in Geneva. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: An Italian army unit led by General Eloiso occupied the town of Mika near the Gambela border on June 27. This town controls the trade route from Gambela to the Abyssinian capital and Jimma and is of great military importance. The purpose of the Italian army's occupation of this town is to cut off the supply route from the Gambela side to the Abyssinians. (30th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Stefani news agency recently reported that the Italian army has occupied the Mega area on the southwestern border of Abyssinia (adjacent to British Kenya). Previously, Mega was the hub for those traveling from Kenya to Abyssinia to engage in anti-Italian propaganda. This can now be controlled. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, the government allocated 1.3 billion lire for the development and colonization of Abyssinia, of which 600 million lire is for military expenses. At the same time, a telegram from the Abyssinian capital stated that an Italian army unit, heading to Mika on the border of the Galla-Sidamo colony, was attacked by Abyssinians. The Italians immediately responded with machine gun fire, causing many Abyssinian casualties. The Italian army then occupied Mika. There is also a report stating that the governors of the Sidamo and Galla provinces have expanded the Italian occupied area in the southwest and established military and civilian government organs in various places on the Kenya border.

<p>(London) The House of Commons met today, and Labour Party members, with the Speaker's permission, held an emergency debate. The debate centered on Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's speech on June 20, which foreshadowed that Britain would advocate lifting sanctions against Italy, and Secretary of State for War Cooper's speech on June 24, which included the phrase "The French frontier is our English frontier." When Labour opposition leader Attlee began the debate, the House was full. Attlee criticized Prime Minister Baldwin's absence (the Prime Minister is resting in the countryside for several days), and then criticized the Secretary of State for War, saying that cabinet members have no right to make separate statements on major public policy matters outside of the House. He expressed his sympathy for the close friendship between Britain and France, but said that the Secretary of State for War's speech has been interpreted as an intention for Britain and France to form a close military alliance, which is contrary to the British government's policy. Baldwin should come to the House in person to announce the policy, and then cabinet members should hold their tongues. Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, saying that he believed Secretary of State for War Cooper's speech was sufficient to demonstrate the government's uncertain purpose, which has reduced Britain's prestige and endangered peace. Churchill then declared that he heard that the draft of Cooper's speech had been reviewed and revised by the Foreign Secretary. He thought this was a very good speech, and its emotions were admirable. Cooper did not say a word against anyone except those countries with aggressive intentions. Home Secretary Simon, representing the government, stated the reasons for the Prime Minister's absence and denied the Secretary of State for War's claim to form a military alliance with France, saying that this kind of accusation is based on baseless words. Simon recounted the situation when the Secretary of State for War gave this speech, saying that his words were not announcing policy, but only wanted to make the people of both countries aware of the urgency of the overall situation. The place to announce policy is naturally the House of Commons, but the government's policy has already been thoroughly announced by Eden and Baldwin in the House of Commons debates on June 18 and 23. The Secretary of State for War's viewpoint is not in conflict with this declaration. The Secretary of State for War sent the draft of his speech to the Foreign Office before the speech, and the Foreign Secretary revised certain sections, but the final draft was not seen by the Foreign Secretary because he was preoccupied with other matters and did not have time to do so, but this was not intentional disregard. At this point, Conservative Party member Wilson rose to say that the speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for War have caused genuine disturbance and panic among those who support the government. Simon replied that he did not think the Secretary of State for War's remarks had this effect. It should be noted that his words did not announce the government's policy. (29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met yesterday afternoon, the opposition leaders raised questions about Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper's speech at the Anglo-French Association in Paris, but the language used was not very intense. This was due to the absence of Prime Minister Baldwin, which resulted in a loss of a target for attack. It is also a fact that the leaders' criticism of the Secretary of State for War was not as severe as their criticism of the lack of coordination among the cabinet members. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, had already given a speech at the Conservative Club supporting the repeal of sanctions against Italy, and Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper had advocated Anglo-French mutual understanding in Paris. The opposition parties could not help but seize on this as a pretext to mock the cabinet, saying that the method of announcing foreign policy was so circuitous that it was ridiculous. In addition, the Secretary of State for War's speech did not mention a word about the collective security policy based on the League of Nations Covenant, which was also unsatisfactory to the opposition parties. Home Secretary Sir John Simon, representing the cabinet, replied that the Secretary of State for War's remarks were only reiterating the views previously expressed by Prime Minister Baldwin. His speech in Paris was addressed to audiences in both Britain and France, and it was necessary to emphasize the common interests of both parties, which was very moving and sufficient to convince the opposition parties. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the speech given by Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper at the Anglo-French Association in Paris a few days ago, several government-affiliated members of parliament recently proposed a motion in the House of Commons, saying, "The House is confident that the government will certainly avoid providing any promises in the military or other fields that would lead the world to believe that Britain has formed an alliance treaty with France or with Soviet Russia, and hopes that it will follow the declaration made by former Prime Minister MacDonald in the House of Commons in June 1933 to promote mutual relations between Britain, France, and Germany." (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin has been resting in Cotswolds for many days. At a time when opposition members of parliament are wantonly attacking him, he has delayed his return to the capital, which has led to speculation from the outside world. Political figures believe that the Prime Minister's health is failing and that stepping down is only a matter of time. One theory is that the mention of failing health is a way to prepare for retirement. Other observers say that the Prime Minister will retire between July and August of this year. The Prime Minister originally hoped to retire after King Edward VIII's coronation ceremony in May of next year, because the King's coronation coincides with the Prime Minister's 70th birthday. Most people believe that the Prime Minister should step down before the King's coronation, but officials insist that the Prime Minister has been working very hard in recent months to handle state affairs. His trip to Cotswolds is purely due to physical reasons, and there are no other reasons. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After French Premier Leon Blum, Foreign Minister Delbos, and British Foreign Secretary Eden held talks in Geneva the other day, it was heard that their opinions had become consistent, and the talk of an Anglo-French alliance had become very rampant. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently commented on this and warned Britain, saying, "Those who advocate an Anglo-French alliance, such as the extreme Conservative member of parliament Churchill, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and Secretary of State for War Duff Cooper, are now making grand pronouncements. However, if Britain is drawn into this kind of alliance treaty and adopts a mechanical policy of mutual assistance obligations, it will be extremely dangerous in terms of the country's interests. This is something that Churchill and his ilk should know." (29th, Havas)</p>

<p>(London) The Labour Party's newspaper, "Daily Herald," recently published a report from its correspondent in Jerusalem, stating that British officials, in order to resolve national disputes, plan to merge the mandated territories of Palestine and Transjordan into a federation. The federation would be divided into eight districts, with the Arab and Jewish nationalities each occupying half, and with Abdullah, the head of Transjordan's Islamic community, as the head of state. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: The situation in Palestine has not improved. Although the cities are quiet, Arabs are still carrying out attacks in the countryside and on the roads. Jews have recently requested the government to fully announce the true situation and insist that Jews should have the right to self-defense. The leaders of the Arab national movement have sent telegrams to the heads of the five Islamic countries of Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, asking them to provide assistance so that the Islamic holy sites can be preserved. The movement's newspaper also stated that the British mandate over Palestine must be rejected. (30th, Havas)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: On Sunday night, a police patrol car patrolling the railway line from Afula to Beit She'an was ambushed twice. Three British police officers were injured, two of them seriously. During the first ambush, the police repelled the rioters. The second ambush occurred near Beit She'an. The rioters fired fiercely, and the police also returned fire. The authorities, due to the riots of the townspeople of Beit She'an, ordered a fine of 300 pounds to be paid. (30th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The fear that the Bedouins of Transjordan will rise up to help the Palestinian Arabs has now subsided slightly. The British government firmly believes that King Abdullah of Transjordan is able to control his people and prevent incidents from occurring. Although the relationship between Transjordan and Palestine has always been cold, they share the same goal of opposing Jewish encroachment. (30th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) After ascending the throne, the King today visited Plymouth for the first time to view the newly built torpedo motorboat. This boat was designed and built by motorboat racer Mr. Payne and can travel 60 miles per hour. After viewing the naval construction on land, the King boarded this boat for a test drive. A total of twelve of these boats are being built, and the cost of every thirteen of them is less than that of a destroyer. The speed is high, and the boat is small, making it difficult for aircraft bombs to hit. The boat is equipped with two torpedo tubes and multiple machine guns. Each boat can accommodate five people and is truly a new naval weapon. The King stayed on the boat for half an hour and watched it launch torpedoes, praising it repeatedly. (30th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Losses Exceed 100 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Chicago: According to a survey report released by the Associated Press today, 18 states are currently experiencing drought and insect disasters. Farmers' losses are estimated to exceed 100 million yuan. The disaster area forms a large triangle, with its edges being Ohio, the Mississippi River, Mississippi, and the Rocky Mountains. The situation in the southeastern states is said to be serious, but the recent rains have alleviated the damage somewhat. The barley region of Canada has also benefited from the rains. However, the northwestern states have become an insect world, and the desire for rain is strong. The insects are mostly grasshoppers, and the affected states include Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, and Oklahoma. It is reported that damage to clothing and equipment is also significant. Recently, rainfall in Colorado and Wyoming has only been one-third of normal, and there has been very little rainfall in the Dakotas in the past two months. In Montana, wheat stalks wither when they grow to only one foot. In most places, the grasslands have turned yellow, so livestock ranchers have had to transport their livestock elsewhere to find forage. (29th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Mr. Kobe, the owner of a certain shop, testified yesterday that he saw a British soldier chasing a person on Hatamen Street around midnight on May 26. The British consulate continued the hearing today. Kobe was cross-examined by a lawyer, and the entire court paid close attention. Kobe confessed that every night until midnight, there are very few pedestrians on Hatamen Street, and the street lights are not bright. He confirmed that the person chasing another was indeed a British soldier. Also, Sasaki's friend, Sazuka (transliteration) was wearing yellow shorts and a blue jacket, and he naturally recognized him as the person being chased. Kobe also answered the lawyer's questions, saying that the person being chased was lost, that he had seen him at the beginning of the chase, that he did not know Sazuka, and then was asked a few more questions, but Kobe could not give a definite answer. Next, Sazuka, an employee of the "puppet state," testified that on May 26, he and Sasaki arrived in Peiping from Zhangjiakou. That evening, he, Sasaki, and another friend had dinner at the Kinazawa Coffee House on Hatamen Street and drank eight or nine quarts of beer, but Sasaki drank very little. He was not drunk. They left the restaurant after midnight, but could not remember the exact time because he was still wandering around. His friend left first, and he and Sasaki slowly walked northeast on the street and met Kobe, who asked if they had bought long-distance bus tickets to Chengde for the next morning. While they were talking, two British soldiers walked past them, wearing yellow uniforms and white belts. He was sure they were British soldiers because of their shoulder badges and military caps. The two soldiers were walking on the west side of the street, heading north. Sasaki and he then also headed north, crossing the street to the west side. While crossing the street, he saw one soldier turn around and hit a rickshaw puller. This was still the two soldiers he had seen initially. The fight started on the east side of the street, and he and Sasaki were on the west side of the street, so they stopped to watch. Then, he continued walking and urged Sasaki to follow him, saying that there was no need to waste time, but Sasaki remained standing still. Then, he heard someone running and saw a soldier running towards him. The soldier who had hit the rickshaw puller ran towards Sasaki. Fearing that he would be beaten, he ran. As the soldier was about to catch up with him, he turned around and pushed him, and the soldier lost his balance and fell to the ground. As he fled, he urged Sasaki to flee as well, but when he looked back, he saw Sasaki taking a few steps back as another soldier approached him. Then, Dr. Terada testified about the cause of Sasaki's death. He wore rubber gloves and a face mask and took Sasaki's brain from a basket to present it as evidence. The spectators were shocked. The royal lawyer, Mr. Bourke, then ordered him to put it away. Terada also said that there was also Mr. Onishi, a Japanese person, who was beaten by a British soldier in a Korean liquor stall on the same day. His injuries were the same as Sasaki's, which proved that he was hit by the same weapon. After being cross-examined, Terada replied that he thought the artery in the brain would not be indirectly vibrated and ruptured. Sazuka will continue to appear in court tomorrow morning to testify.

<h3 id="e55">Prospects for Buddhism in Europe <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Opposition is one of the natural phenomena in the world. Cold and heat multiply each other, and surplus and deficit are divided, and the general rate is similar. However, the opposition between Eastern and Western cultures has gradually become an undeniable fact since the 19th century. Originally, the politics and religion of the East took peace as the central thought, and reaching Great Harmony from peace as the highest goal, while the politics and religion of the West took force as the central thought, and reaching Great Harmony from force as the highest goal. Therefore, those who cherish virtue lose their power, and each follows its own path. When the religious wars, material civilization, and aggressive policies of the West were at their peak, the religious freedom, spiritual civilization, and politeness of the East became more and more oppressed. The so-called white race is naturally arrogant. However, since the European War from 1914 to 1920, the Western powers have felt that the people's livelihood is declining and unbearable. The masses have realized the pain and thought deeply, and hesitated at the crossroads. They have gradually realized that the previous central thought of force was inappropriate, and they should strive to find a way to recover. Therefore, Eastern philosophy, Buddhism, etc., have taken the opportunity to revive and move westward. For example, the popular translations of Confucianism and Lao Tzu's theories in various countries are of course needless to say. Even the rise of Buddhist associations and widespread dissemination are enough to symbolize the changes of the times. If there is a so-called critical point in the opposition between Eastern and Western cultures, this is the time. Now, if you examine 100 Westerners, there are many who oppose aggressive wars and do not advocate rejecting foreign religions. Confucianism cherishes universal love, Buddhism takes compassion as its foundation, and Lao Tzu takes inaction as governance. The spirit of Eastern civilization is enough to fascinate Westerners. Isn't that so? The reporter is not talented and would like to briefly describe the current situation of Buddhism in Europe.</p>
<p>The initial step of Buddhism in Europe dates back to the end of the 19th century. According to the self-report of German Buddhist C.T. Staauss, Frankfurt am Mrin, who is 84 years old, he has been reading Edwin Arnold's Light of Asia since 1887. In 1891, the Mahabodhi Society was established in India. The 84-year-old Buddhist was a member of the Society at that time. The head of the Society, the Indian monk Anagasika Dharmapala, represented Ceylon at the World Religious Conference in Chicago, USA in 1893. The German was formally ordained by this monk.</p>
<p>In 1904, an Englishman named Alan Bennett, with the Dharma name Ananda Metteyya, introduced Buddhism to England from Qiu, but he died within a few years. His disciples commemorated him with the Buddhist Review, a famous Buddhist magazine in Qiu. The magazine was printed for 12 years. Later, it was suspended to transfer funds to build a Buddhist Lodge. The Buddhist Lodge was initially named Lodge of the Theosophical Society. Not long after the completion of the Lodge, the Indian monk Anagarika Dharmapala came to preach and created the Buddhist Mission 41, which is still very popular today. The Buddhist Mission also has the establishment of the Mahabodhi Society, which is now the mainstay of Buddhism in England. In September 1934, the Society convened the first European Buddhist Representative Conference, which was very grand for a time.</p>
<p>The British Buddhist Mahabodhi Society is located in London at 41, Gloncester Raadf Regent’s Park, Londonf N,. W.I. Its host is A.H. Perkins. It has five main purposes: To widely disseminate the Pali classics and Buddhist teachings; To practice Buddhism with integrity; To establish a Buddhist library in London; To subsidize preaching monks stationed in Europe; To contact and help other Buddhist groups in Europe. The Society has a preaching lecture once a week. The annual membership fee is six shillings, and the permanent membership fee is five pounds. The Society's publication, The Wheel, is published monthly and sells for four pence, free for members. It also publishes many books, but they are all superficial and not worth introducing. The Society also plans to recruit a minimum of 4,000 members in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a Buddhist Mission in Liverpool, but the details are unknown.</p>
<p>The establishment of the German Buddhist Association began in 1922, with the association name Gemeinde um Audda and the address in Berlin. The founder, German Herrl Martin Steinke, has now been shaved as a monk, with the Dharma name Tao Chun. He published a magazine named Lie Brockensammlung. Later, German Dr. Paul Dahlke (deceased) founded another Buddhist temple in Berlin. The temple is a beautiful palace, and its disciples hold preaching celebrations every first and fifteenth day of the lunar month. Easterners often come to join in the fun. In the summer of 1933, Dharma Master Ananda Kansayayana preached here. The Japanese monk Junji Sukakibara once lived here for two years. Dharma Master Rehela Sankrityayana came to live for two weeks three years ago. In addition, Georg Grimm created the Lodge of Three Jewels, while in Hamburg (Hamburg - hosted by Herr Persian) and Konisburg, there is also a Buddhist association house. The exquisite Buddhist temple created by Dr. Dahlke is named Das Buddhistische Hosu, hosted by Mr. Guide Auster. The French Buddhist Society (Guide Auter Les Smis du) was founded by Dharma Master Taixu when he traveled to Europe a few years ago. The members are from France, Germany, England, the United States, Russia, Hungary, and other countries.</p>
<p>Switzerland also has a Buddhist association, located in Locarno, Geneva. There are many other Buddhists scattered in Italy, the Czech Republic, and major cities in Germany, which cannot be described in detail.</p>
<p>As for the hosts of the Buddhist Associations Bonddhisme Dharmapasa Trust in India and Ceylon, they are Daya Hewaqitarne and NID. S. Silva.</p>
<p>Glimpses of European Buddhist Opinions - European Buddhist opinions best represent the extent of Westerners' understanding of Buddhism and their preaching methods. In the following sections, I will translate them directly and roughly, omitting names to save space.</p>
<p>Modern Europe urgently needs Buddhism to liberate the mechanized life of the Western masses. Western materialism and selfishness will lead to the destruction of world culture. Only the spirit of the Buddha in heaven can save it. We, regardless of East or West, Europe or Asia, or skin color, are all believers in the light of Asia. I deeply wish to be reborn in the Buddhist land of India in the next life. Buddhism is the foundation of peace and the solvent of sin. In the future, the work of the Buddhist Association should focus on training European and Asian youth for preaching work. I hope that Buddhist organizations in the East will do their best to donate funds for preaching in the West, just as Westerners preach in the East. Some say that the East is poor and may not have the remaining power to go to the West. This is a big mistake. The West must build more temples and monasteries for Buddhist disciples to practice. In terms of the Western environment and customs, the architecture of Buddhist temples should be built in the Western style, just like Buddhist temples in China, Tibet, Ceylon, and Japan have different styles. There are two weaknesses in Western Buddhist preaching: First, talent and strength are not concentrated; second, the economy is not abundant. Magazines should also use English, French, and German to circulate in various European countries. It is very uneconomical for each country to publish separately. Apart from the Buddhist scriptures, there is no other way to bring world peace. Gathering a large number of peaceful people can create a peaceful culture. The power of monarchs, soldiers, and political and legal authorities is not as great. The power of Bolshevism, Fascist Imperialism, and Democracy is also not as great. Our summer school has been able to practice non-killing and relieve poverty. In the future, I hope that Buddhist countries in the East will generously provide assistance in order to prosper. I hope that we Europeans will not regard Buddhism as a doctrine, a theory, a philosophy, or literature, but as a way of life, so that it can be used to correct the various shortcomings of Christianity's enlightenment of the West. Christianity in Germany has reached its final stage. After that, the development of Buddhism will undoubtedly progress day by day. German Buddhists seem to be hiring a Dharma Master from the East to stay in Europe permanently to facilitate preaching. The value of a Dharma Master is far greater than that of a magazine. Buddhism is always fresh, always fashionable, always bright, and always suitable for the needs of life. We must support vegetarian associations and oppose all cruel scientific behaviors.</p>
<p>The reporter described the opinions of Western Buddhists, and I can't help but feel deeply. Can Buddhism really stop European materialism, aggression, and selfishness? Will the weak and small nations of the East forever rely on Buddhism to survive? Does the world really not need material civilization? Judging from the current state of the world, these issues are still just empty talk and fantasies. Western Buddhists have a shallow understanding of Buddhism and urgently need the assistance of Eastern Buddhist organizations. They also urgently need Eastern assistance in preaching expenses. Are Easterners unmoved? When will this opposition of Eastern and Western cultures be like the opposition of cold and heat in water, completely reaching uniformity? Great Harmony, Great Harmony, I look forward to it.</p>

<p>Planning to Take the American Commercial Rights into the Hands of Japan - The Current Manchurian-Mongolian Wool Company is Actively Proceeding</p>
<p>Shenyang News: The Manchurian-Mongolian Wool Weaving Company established by the Japanese has now increased its capital by 3 million yuan in order to be active in the markets of Northeast China, North China, and South China. It is reported that the company plans to study and improve Chinese wool, starting from practical aspects. The factories in Shenyang, Nagoya, and Okazaki, as well as the Okazaki factory, all take Chinese wool products as the principle. In the future, it plans to add a factory in Tianjin, taking that place as the center, and transfer the commercial rights of Chinese wool from the United States to Japan. Therefore, a group of investigators from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and the Manchurian-Japanese Merino Association, who went to Tianjin a few days ago, are engaged in investigating North China wool and the progress strategy of the company, and are actively promoting its realization.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shandong Province to Implement the Third Phase of Abolishing Illegal Taxes and Levies <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Provincial and County Petty Taxes and Brokerage Fees to Be Completely Abolished, and Field Tax Surcharges in Various Counties to Be Reduced</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Our province is complying with the Central Government's order to abolish illegal taxes and levies. In the past two phases, 780,000 yuan were abolished. There are still more than 400,000 yuan left, which will be completely abolished. However, the taxes and levies in various counties are mostly used for legitimate purposes. If there is no way to compensate for them, sudden abolition will inevitably hinder the progress of government affairs. Therefore, it has been delayed until now and has not been implemented. Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, has allocated 40% of the Central Government's stamp tax to our province. The 160,000 yuan (stamp tax revenue of 800,000 yuan for the whole year) that should have been allocated from January to June of this year, which falls within the scope of the 24th year, has already been allocated for land reporting purposes. It is planned that starting from the 25th year, this fund will be used to offset the abolition of illegal taxes and levies at the provincial and county levels. Regarding this work, the Finance Department has carefully calculated that, in addition to allocating 10% of the stamp tax, 80,000 yuan, to cover the expenses of the Shandong Donation and Tax Management Committee, 12,000 yuan, the remaining amount will be used to abolish petty taxes and brokerage fees at the provincial level, and 30% of the county stamp tax revenue, 240,000 yuan. It has been found that the field tax surcharge in various counties is excessive. The number of counties with the highest field tax is 62. It is planned to issue a general order to limit the regular tax to one yuan, and the surcharge should not exceed one yuan and five jiao. The reduced amount will be offset by more than 70,000 yuan of the stamp tax revenue, and the remaining tens of thousands of yuan will be used to abolish the local illegal taxes and levies in various counties. The detailed list of illegal taxes and levies that should be imposed in each county has now been specified, and a general order has been issued to each county to implement it on July 1st. It is estimated that there are still more than 300,000 yuan of remaining taxes and levies in the province. In the next phase, they can be completely abolished.</p>

<p>Li Axiu, a woman from Baitang Village, a commoner village in the Third District, Jiading, is 21 years old and has been betrothed to a man surnamed Li. The wedding will take place this winter. However, she is promiscuous. Two years ago, she had an affair with Xu Jinghe, who lives in Dongmaojiazhai. Now, there is Xu Taixin, who also lives in Maojiazhai. He graduated from the special training class of the county's security regiment. He recently became a widower after losing his wife. Li also developed a relationship with him. Jinghe was jealous and resentful. He repeatedly borrowed money from Taixin to cause trouble. Taixin did not succumb to him. At dusk on the 29th, Jinghe went to cause trouble again. Taixin expelled him with force. Jinghe was no match for him and returned home. He immediately took a sharp blade and went again. Taking advantage of Taixin's lack of preparation in the dark, he stabbed him seven times in a row, one in the chest and four or five in the abdomen. He died instantly. Axiu heard the sound and came out to look. She was also stabbed twice in the left waist, and then stabbed several times in a row. Her intestines flowed out of her abdomen. The murderer, having achieved his goal, went directly to the Xuhang Public Security Police Station under its jurisdiction, turned himself in, and was escorted to the county this morning by the station with a document. Li Axiu, who was injured, and Xu Weiyuan were sent to the Jiading Hospital in the city by people that night. After the doctor's treatment, Axiu would be safe if she did not develop inflammation within a day and night. However, Weiyuan's intestinal wall was ruptured, and feces flowed out. Although he was sutured, he eventually died. He died at 10 am this morning (30th). Shan Longbao, the trial officer of the county government, together with the police, has separately identified the corpses, ordered the family members of the deceased to coffin and bury them, and detained the murderer Xu Jinghe for investigation.</p>

<p>At about 7 pm the night before last (29th), a young Shanghai traveler opened room 94 at the Sanxin Hotel outside Changmen. He wrote that he was from Shanghai, named Xu Huizhong, 22 years old. After resting in the room for a while, he strolled around the various halls. Then he went out to buy things near the road. After a short stay, he returned, closed the door, and went to sleep. At about 2 am yesterday morning, the tea boy on duty suddenly heard groans in the room. He hurriedly opened the door and entered, only to see that Xu's face was pale, his mind was confused, and there were bright red bloodstains on his lips. An empty bottle of Lysol water was also found upstairs. Knowing that he had taken Lysol and committed suicide, he was rushed to Suyong Hospital for treatment. He improved slightly, but the poisoning was too deep, and his life was no longer guaranteed.</p>

<p>Zhao Maoxiu, a resident of No. 34, Housimen Street, Tuiguan Arch, in the city, is 32 years old. He used to work at a money house in Shanghai. In the 20th year of the Republic, he married Wang Shiqin, the daughter of Wang Chuanlu from Xiaoheshang, as his wife. They have one son and one daughter. Recently, Zhao lost his job and returned home. His relationship with his wife Shiqin became strained, and he stayed at his mother's brother's home for recuperation. The day before yesterday afternoon, Maoxiu returned home, and the couple suddenly had a quarrel. Overwhelmed with anger, he attempted suicide. However, his family members persuaded him to stop. Afterwards, Wang was also depressed. Yesterday (30th) morning, at about 3:00 AM, Wang secretly took poison in her room. Her family members noticed and rushed her to Puren Hospital for treatment. However, she had taken too much poison, and it was too late. She eventually died, causing much discussion among the nearby residents. The reason for Wang's poisoning is even more difficult to guess. Furthermore, the family transported the coffin back to their hometown at night, making the matter even more mysterious. Also, Zhang Rulin, a Changshu traveler at the Jiaotong Hostel under the Gongyun Bridge, also committed suicide due to economic pressure.</p>

<p>The county government of this county believes that there are many shantytowns scattered throughout the urban area, making management difficult. In order to reorganize them, a Reorganization Committee for Shantytowns in the Urban Area has been specially established. In addition to the heads of various agencies and organizations such as the Party Headquarters, County Government, Construction Bureau, Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Land Bureau, First District Office, Rickshaw Trade Association, and Rickshaw Pullers Association serving as ex officio members, Qian Sunqing and Xue Mingjian have also been invited to serve as members. County Magistrate Long Tiyao has been designated as the permanent committee member. The committee has established seven sections: General Affairs, Investigation, Construction, Implementation, Education, Sanitation, and Design. Yesterday, County Magistrate Long convened the first preparatory meeting, which passed the draft organizational regulations for the Reorganization Committee for Shantytowns in the Urban Area and the general outline of the plan for reorganizing shantytowns in the urban area. It was also decided to conduct a trial in the First District first, with the Investigation Section conducting a preliminary survey of locations. It was also stipulated that the urban shantytown area should be limited to a maximum of ten districts. All shantytown residents should move into the districts within six months. Each shantytown district should have at least one elementary school, one literacy school for civilians, and a public hall and entertainment venue. The funds will be subsidized by deductions from the rickshaw rental fees collected by each rickshaw company.</p>

<p>The County Middle School here is the highest institution of learning in the county, and the selection of the principal is a matter of great importance to all parties. Recently, during the school's graduation examination, the Education Department sent Zhou Bowen to Changshu to conduct spot checks. It was discovered that the students had formed small groups and were distributed throughout the classrooms. Excellent students were assigned to the students in front, behind, left, and right as "central distributors." During the arithmetic spot check, Commissioner Zhou discovered the scheme on the spot and suspended all testing, pending reporting to the Education Department for review. Commissioner Zhou believed that this type of organized cheating was clearly pre-planned and expressed his dissatisfaction. Now, citizens such as Zhao Shijie have filed a petition with the Education Department, stating that this situation was caused by the principal Gu Yanru's usual negligence and requesting his replacement. There are many individuals actively seeking to succeed him, including Zhu Yinli and Zhang Yuanming.</p>

After the ship departed, he drank happily and showed no signs of distress. He chatted with his cabin mates about business conditions. The tea server was not suspicious of him. Unexpectedly, when the ship reached the waters off Litongsha, he jumped into the sea and committed suicide. At that time, the other passengers and the tea server were unaware. It was not until about 3:00 AM yesterday morning that the tea server searched for the passenger everywhere and realized that he had jumped into the sea and committed suicide. They checked the passenger's belongings and found two suicide notes in addition to some scattered clothes. One was addressed to Fei Beisheng at No. 16 Li Yaqian, Zhenhai, and the other to his two cousins, Zhou Zipin and Zilian, at Cunshuli, Muqiao Street, Fangbang Bridge, Shanghai.

<h3 id="e73">Letter <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I was deeply surprised to read the news item "Severe Urging of Old Taxes" from Jiaxing in your newspaper's third page on June 26th. After investigation, our county is handling all procedures for summoning and detaining tax-delinquent property owners in accordance with regulations in this tax collection effort. We are especially strict in restraining the collection police. All detained people are delinquent taxpayers, and there have been no cases of suicide. The original news report, which stated that "there have been many cases of suicide due to fear of the harshness of the tax police and inability to pay," is entirely fabricated, with no factual basis. As for the provincial officials led by Wei Songtang, who were recently sent to Jiaxing, they came specifically to investigate land tax and deed tax matters. The original news report, which stated that "the people are already impoverished, and the province, upon learning of this, has sent Wei Songtang and others to Jiaxing to investigate the rural situation in order to verify the facts," is even more untrue. I am concerned that this will obscure the truth and mislead the public, so I am writing to request that your newspaper promptly correct this information to avoid misunderstandings. With best wishes,</p>
<p>The Secretariat of the Jiaxing County Government, June 27th.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Banks Investing in Rural Areas <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Approximately 15 million yuan this year.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, rural lending is now an important business for domestic banks. According to financial circles, this type of lending has only been conducted for three years. Initially, only the Farmers Bank of China paid attention to this. Later, the Shanghai Bank achieved considerable success in the production and sales lending for Shaanxi cotton. As a result, various banks competed to emulate this. Since the government implemented the legal tender policy last year, the financial situation has improved. However, due to the stagnation of real estate and the reform of public bonds, capital has accumulated in cities, resulting in a surplus. In order to fully utilize their capital, banks have sought to develop their business, and lending to rural areas has become their main avenue. In the future, investment in rural areas will see a significant increase. However, reviewing past performance, the most difficult issues in failing to make lending widespread and deep are the lack of talent and the disunity of organizations. These issues should be improved by banks and the government in the future. Other issues include the tendency for investment to be concentrated in prosperous areas, while poor and remote areas are still not benefiting. There must be comprehensive planning in terms of distribution. It is heard that the total amount of rural lending this year will be approximately 15 million yuan, including approximately one million yuan from the Bank of China, two million yuan from the Bank of Communications, 1.5 million yuan from the Shanghai Bank, and one million yuan from the Jin City Bank. This does not include the Farmers Bank of China, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and the China Agricultural Credit Syndicate. The investment areas are mainly in Anhui and Shaanxi provinces.</p>

<h3 id="e91">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company State-Run Dock and Warehouse Management Office Established Today <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's docks and warehouses are located throughout various ports across the country, all in strategically important locations. The majority of these are self-operated warehouses, dedicated to the berthing of the company's ships and the loading, unloading, and storage of goods. In Shanghai, in addition to the South Warehouse (Jinliyuan) and the New Warehouse (Yangjiadu), which are self-operated, there are also the Central, North, and Hua Warehouses, which are operated for business purposes and are highly trusted by various shipping companies and merchants, enjoying thriving business. However, the original organization was not yet fully sound, resulting in a lack of complete unification of exclusive authority and insufficient strictness in management. Acting Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation, recognizing this issue during his inspection in Shanghai in May of this year, decided to establish a Dock and Warehouse Management Office, directly under the General Office, to oversee all warehouses and docks across the board. The aim is to unify management and command, strengthen the organization, adopt scientific management in a suitable environment, reduce turnover, and improve operational efficiency. Externally, the emphasis is on minimizing procedures for customers and facilitating convenient communication, with the goal of providing thorough service. It is believed that once customers are satisfied and the company earns a good reputation, business will undoubtedly improve, benefiting not only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company but also the general dockworkers who depend on it for their livelihood, allowing them to increase their income. It is also rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Government is currently planning to install truck ferries, which will immediately increase the value of warehouses in Pudong, further facilitating the loading and unloading of goods. The Management Office has now been organized, with its address located next to the General Office at 33 Fuzhou Road, and is officially established today. The original management offices of the three warehouses will be simultaneously abolished and incorporated into the Dock and Warehouse Management Office. The Ministry of Transportation has appointed Tan Boying, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as the concurrent Manager of the Dock and Warehouse Management Office. Two assistant managers have also been appointed, one of whom is Mr. Price (Capt. G.H. Price) from the Maritime Affairs Section of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation. The Ministry of Transportation has also dispatched Wu Yu, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau, to administer the oath. It is said that the ceremony will be simple, and the office will officially commence operations today.</p>

The Bureau replied that it had no authority to set prices. The Association believes that the excessive price not only hinders promotion but also places a burden on citizens. Therefore, it sent another letter to the General Association yesterday, requesting it to evaluate an appropriate price and submit a detailed report to the central government for approval to reduce prices in order to facilitate promotion and enhance national prestige. The original letter stated: “Upon receiving your letter, we found the General Bureau for the Production and Sale of Party and National Flags' response to be official and pompous. They stated that our 46th Branch did not investigate the facts, relied on likes and dislikes, and took advantage of the situation to recklessly attack, which is displeasing to read. The high price of the flags is related to promotion. If one only seeks one's own benefit and disregards the pain of purchasing at high prices, promotion will be impossible. Because we believe the high price is a fact, we dare not remain silent, making it difficult to promote the dignified national emblem. Therefore, we must come forward to advocate for a price reduction, which is fair and just, and has nothing to do with 'relying on likes and dislikes, taking advantage of the situation, or recklessly attacking.' Since the Bureau has no authority to set prices, we can ignore it. We urge your association to first evaluate an appropriate price and submit a detailed report to Party and government agencies, which will be forwarded to the central government for approval to reduce prices. This is to emphasize uniform standards for the production and sale of the national emblem, to enhance prestige, and we will never rely on approved terms to seek profit. Our repercussions are out of love and are not unique to our organization.”</p>

<h3 id="e96">Money Exchanges Begin Abolishing "Spot Exchange Fund" Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Money Shops to Return Custodianship of Spot Exchange Fund, Clearing Members' Spot Exchange Balances Daily</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Clearing Association, located within the Ningbo Road Guild Hall, includes both North and South Shanghai exchange money shops as members. For silver dollar transactions between members exceeding 500 yuan, official forms are required. For transactions below 500 yuan, before the end of 1924, immediate cash settlement was required. However, after the Yongfeng Bank's silver transport was robbed, the association devised a new method, requiring each member and "Yuan" small trade to deposit 10,000 taels of silver in cash with the association, which would then deposit it in Chinese and foreign banks as a "spot exchange fund" for security. After that, for outstanding amounts less than 500 yuan, only the counterpart's stamp was required, and no further cash settlement was needed, simplifying the procedure. Unexpectedly, at the end of 1926, the Yanfeng Bank declared bankruptcy, impacting the spot exchange cash of various shops, exceeding the original fund. The annual money exchange meeting in 1927 proposed and resolved that outstanding amounts would still be recorded and not settled in cash, but on the 2nd and 16th of each month, cash settlement was required to prevent the accumulation of large amounts that exceeded the 10,000 tael fund's protection. The fund was subsequently increased twice to 30,000 yuan per shop, and settlement was changed to once a year at the end of the year, under the management of the Money Exchange Joint Reserve. Following the passage of the third session's ninth regular members' meeting of the Money Exchange Association to abolish the spot exchange fund, it was implemented yesterday. The Money Exchange Reserve has returned the spot exchange funds of 30,000 yuan per shop to the 48 member shops, including Fuyuan, Hengxun, and Tongyu, transferring it into the accounts under each shop's name. From now on, members' spot exchange will be cleared with the Reserve daily. The association's announcement is recorded below: "Greetings, with reference to the proposal approved at today's ninth regular members' representative meeting, approving the third session's seventeenth executive committee's proposal to abolish the spot exchange fund of 30,000 yuan per shop deposited by members, and to return it, with all members' spot exchange to be cleared with the Reserve daily, a resolution has been passed. It was further proposed to the meeting for public decision, and the meeting resolved that transactions over 500 yuan should still use official forms sent to the association's official form office, while transactions under 500 yuan should be cleared mutually, with small official forms sent to the Reserve for daily clearing, and it was decided to implement this from June 30th. All receipts for spot exchange funds held by the various shops should also be sent to the Reserve on the 30th for transfer." The Shanghai Money Exchange Association.</p>

<p>Cao Xiang'e and Others Released on Bail</p>
<p>Cui Changgui, a bodyguard employed by Attorney Bao Gang, accused Bao in the Public Security Bureau of posing as a fake lawyer, indecently assaulting his fiancée, Yang Yuehua, and inciting interference with marriage. The detective team arrested Bao's wife, Cao Xiang'e, tea servant Zhang Jinxiang, and rickshaw puller friend Ma Heshang, and sought Bao Gang for investigation. Bao Gang surrendered himself to the District Court, accusing Cui Changgui and Yang Yuehua of conspiring to frame him, and detective team leader Zhang Datong, squad leader Xue Shilin, supervisor Wang Peiting, and detective Guo Shaochen of dereliction of duty and unlawful arrest. The Public Security Bureau transferred the case to the District Court for trial the day before yesterday, and all those arrested were detained. The day before yesterday (the 29th), upon instruction, Bao's wife Cao Xiang'e, Zhang Jinhua, and Ma Heshang were released on bail. Yang Yuehua was summoned yesterday (the 30th) and taken back by Cui Changgui. The case is awaiting summons for Bao Gang and others for further questioning.</p>

<p>Zhang Xinghai, the Chinese Head Constable of the Hongkou Police Station, lived at No. 8 Longzhi Lane, Kang Nao Tu Road. On April 6th of this year, several robbers broke into his home and stole clothing, silver, and other items, valued at over 3,000 yuan. Following an investigation by Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and others from the Chengdu Road Police Station, Yang Benzhang, Li Desheng, Dai Dexing, and three others were arrested and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the eighth criminal court and announced the verdict: Yang Benzhang was sentenced to nine years in prison, Li Desheng was sentenced to five years in prison, and Dai Dexing was found not guilty. Yang and Li were transferred at the request of the French Police, which the court approved.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Ruan Jinji Sues News Branch Director Liao Jiongran and Others; Declared Not Guilty <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Liao Jiongran, Director of the News Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, bureau member Huang Feiren, patrol officer Long Jianpo, and others were recently sued by Ruan Jinji, a Funing native residing on Haichang Road and engaged in construction, through attorneys Zhang Yongji and Sun Fucheng, in the District Court for dereliction of duty, infringement of freedom, fraud, and other charges. During the court hearing presided over by Judge Zhang Peiming, the plaintiff claimed that he collected rent from Tang Xiaozhang, a resident of a shantytown, but was beaten instead. He reported the incident to the police, who detained Tang Xiaozhang, but instead designated the plaintiff as the defendant and sent him to the prosecutor's office. After investigation by Prosecutor Kong, Tang was released on bail and prosecuted for assault, while the plaintiff was released. The reason for the bureau's reversal of right and wrong was that Patrol Officer Long solicited a bribe from the plaintiff without success and made false statements to Director Liao Jiongran. Bureau member Huang Feiren, without investigating the case, reversed the facts, releasing the guilty and detaining the innocent. Such darkness cannot be allowed to continue, and he requested legal action. Liao Jiongran, Huang Feiren, Long Jianpo, and others, represented by attorney Zhan Jifeng, defended in court, stating that on June 10th, the case was brought to the bureau by a patrolman from the Haichang Road post. Under interrogation, Tang Xiaozhang testified that Ruan Jinji wanted to burn down the shantytown due to a grudge. Tang heard about this, argued with Ruan, and called the police. Ruan testified that he was collecting rent from Tang, who refused to pay and threatened violence. Each side presented their own version of events, so they were both sent to the third section of the General Bureau for verification. Because arson was alleged in the mutual accusations, which is a serious offense, they should be investigated together. This was done in accordance with police regulations and is not illegal. The plaintiff is clearly pursuing a private agenda, making false accusations. At this point, the judge declared the debate closed and announced the verdict in court: the defendants were all found not guilty.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Gao Jingmei Appeals Case Against Xi Jingyong <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Debate Concluded; Sentencing Scheduled</p>
<p>Xi Jingyong, a local resident, 30 years old, residing at No. 77 Ningguo An Road, Beichuan Fourth Road, is an accountant at the Accounting Office of the China Merchants Bureau, stationed at the North Station Branch. Last month, Xi was suddenly sued by Gao Jingmei, a local woman residing at No. 9 Yongping Lane, Ningbo Road, in the First Special District Court for offenses against public morals and abandonment of contract, with an attached civil suit seeking damages for loans and alimony totaling 1,650 yuan. It was alleged that three years ago, when Gao Jingmei worked as a dancer at the LaFayette Dance Hall, she met Xi, who frequented the dance hall. At that time, the defendant used sweet words and false pretenses, claiming that he had no wife and was willing to marry Gao. He promised to hold a wedding as soon as the opportunity arose. Gao Jingmei, being weak-willed, complied with his requests and was soon forced to cohabit. Later, when Gao repeatedly urged him to hold the wedding, Xi kept delaying. When he could no longer avoid it, he claimed that he already had a wife and that holding another wedding would constitute bigamy. He asked Gao Jingmei to understand his difficult situation and remain patient, with Xi providing a monthly living allowance of 100 yuan while still cohabiting. He promised to divorce his previous wife within three years and then marry Gao, and if Xi breached the contract, he would pay 5,000 dollars as alimony to Gao. A written agreement was signed on the spot and given to Gao Jingmei for safekeeping. As a result, Gao was deeply convinced. Unexpectedly, starting in February or March of last year, Xi suddenly stopped visiting. Despite various attempts to inquire, he ignored her completely and even claimed that the aforementioned document was forged by Gao. Gao Jingmei finally realized that Xi had lost his conscience and had abandoned her. She was forced to hire a lawyer and file a lawsuit. After several trials in the First Special District Court, the plaintiff's evidence was deemed insufficient and the case was dismissed. However, Gao Jingmei believed that the defendant's guilt was undeniable and, based on Article 491, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, supplemented her reasoning and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The court approved the appeal and held a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff and defendant, each accompanied by their lawyers, arrived in court on time. The appellant first stated the reasons for disagreeing with the original judgment, and then questioned the circumstances of their meeting. Xi denied cohabiting with Gao Jingmei and issuing the written agreement. The presiding judge, believing that the case was clear, ordered the start of the debate. After the lawyers on both sides debated, he announced the conclusion and scheduled sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Lou Bing'ao Sues Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner for Incorrect Medication After Son's Death <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yu Zanchen Counters with Ancient Texts; Judge Awaits Expert Assessment</p>
<p>Lou Bing'ao, a Shaoxing native, runs the Lou Xingheng Clothing Store at No. 107 Peide Lane, Da Ma Road. Recently, he hired attorney Shen Xingxia and filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Yu Zanchen, a Yuyao native who runs the Huijiuxi Hall of Traditional Chinese Medicine, located at No. 317 Shanhai Road, for causing death by negligence. The factual basis of the lawsuit is as follows: the plaintiff's seven-year-old only son, Shuigen, developed a fever and rash on May 6th of this year. The plaintiff sought treatment from the defendant, Yu Zanchen, who prescribed medicine without taking a pulse or recording a case history. He was re-examined the following day, and the condition remained the same. Over the next five days, he was seen daily, and the prescriptions given were all without pulse readings. On the 10th, the defendant saw that the rash had turned inward and the illness had become severe. Only then did he record a pulse reading. By the 13th, the condition had become even more dangerous, so another traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, Ding Zhongliang, was called in for treatment. He determined that the defendant's diagnosis was incorrect and could not be treated. Although he tried his best to save the child, it was ineffective, and he died on the 17th. An internal attack of the rash should be treated with dispersal and support, but the defendant used 3 qian of stir-fried mulberry bark, which is a medicine that drains the lungs, causing the lung qi to weaken further. The defendant has committed a crime under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and should be punished according to the law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Tan Xinzhen of the First Special District Court opened the hearing. Yu Zanchen arrived in court with his lawyer. Lou Bing'ao first stated the circumstances, and when questioned, Yu Zanchen stated that he has been practicing medicine for over ten years, is a member of the Shenzhou Medical Association, and a registered doctor with the Municipal Health Bureau. He denied the plaintiff's accusation that the use of stir-fried mulberry bark was an error and presented several medical books to prove it. Judge Tan stated that the case should be assessed by experts before proceeding. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that since the defendant is a member of the Shenzhou Medical Association, the assessment of the case should be sent to the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Association for fairness. The defendant's lawyer stated that the Shenzhou Medical Association and the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association have had disagreements, and the defendant is not a member of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association. For a fair judgment, it should be sent to an impartial body. The plaintiff's lawyer then proposed the Shanghai Branch of the Central National Medical Institute, stating that it is the highest authority on traditional Chinese medicine and would be impartial. Judge Tan agreed and ordered the case to be rescheduled.</p>

<p>French Municipal Council's Public Works Bureau Demands Fee for Pharmaceutical Business License; Request to Taxpaying Chinese Association to Lodge Representation</p>
<p>The Nationalist Society stated that the Fourth District Branch of the Second Special District Citizens' Union convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday at 5 PM regarding the case of citizen Ji A'er borrowing usurious loans from Wu Cao Shi. On the 5th of last month, during mediation at the Yihe Teahouse on Huanghe Road, a physical altercation ensued between the parties. French Concession police detective Sun Qiwan shot and killed Ji Shilin, who was injured. Subsequently, Ji A'er was detained by the police and sentenced to 20 days of detention by the court. Ji Yang Shi, a member of the Ji family, appealed to various parties for assistance and wept for help. Committee members Tong Lizhang, Ye Ruizhai, Zheng Ziliang, Sun Ruiting, Zhang Youmin, Xia Shanxiao, Sun Shengchang, Cheng Yueting (representing Tong Lizhang), He Yaozhang, and more than 30 representatives from the Nantong Association, including Ge Futian, were present. Ye Ruizhai was publicly elected as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman delivered a report.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The report stated that regarding the case of French police detective Sun Qiwan fatally shooting citizen Ji Shilin, the committee members Ye Ruizhai and Tong Lizhang investigated the truth. On June 4th, Ji A'er went to the Yue family on Runde South Lane and encountered Chen Xiangrong. Initially, they talked, but then they argued and fought. As a result, both parties agreed to meet at the Yihe Teahouse on Huanghe Road at 3 PM on June 5th for tea and mediation. Ji A'er's brother, Shilin, fearing that his brother would be at a disadvantage, went to the teahouse with him. When they arrived at the teahouse, Wu Cao Shi and others were already there. Subsequently, detective number 76 from the police station came up and asked who "Little Chongming" was (referring to Ji A'er). After asking, he pulled out handcuffs, intending to handcuff Ji A'er. At this time, his brother, Shilin, seeing the detective arresting his brother without reason, stepped forward to question him. Ji A'er, sensing that the situation was not good, and his brother went downstairs to escape. Seeing the Jis escaping, the detective chased them downstairs. He tripped and fell on the stairs, becoming enraged. He then fired a shot from his pistol, hitting Ji Shilin in the back and exiting through his chest. The deceased ran to the entrance of number 8 Jialele Road, where he collapsed and died, and so on.</p>
<p>Compatriot Report</p>
<p>Following this, the Nantong Compatriot Association representative, Ge Futian, reported the investigation of the incident, noting two suspicious points: The Chinese detective initially claimed self-defense in court, then said it was an accidental discharge. The police had sent people to mediate, but the association refused. He also requested the assistance of the association to uphold justice and expressed his gratitude, and so on.</p>
<p>Motions Passed</p>
<p>The association will first send letters to the French Police Department and the Second Special District Local Court, demanding the swift dismissal and investigation of the perpetrator, Chinese detective Sun Qiwan, and initiating a public prosecution. Demand that the French authorities effectively guarantee the safety of citizens within the concession and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Send letters to the Lawyers Association's Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Committee and the People's Legal Aid Society, requesting them to uphold justice and provide unified assistance. Organize a legal research group, inviting various legal experts to jointly research and contribute opinions for reference. Send separate letters to the district branches, requesting unified assistance in this case. Send a letter to the Second Special District Citizens' General Association, discussing effective measures to guarantee the safety of citizens in the future. Send a letter to the French Concession Taxpaying Chinese Association, urging them to lodge a serious representation to ensure the safety of taxpaying citizens. Regarding private prosecution, the bereaved family will independently engage a lawyer to prosecute. Send a letter to lawyer Cai Xiaobai, thanking him for providing free legal defense, upholding justice, and expressing gratitude. Seek participation from various groups to organize the Ji Shilin Support Association to mount a comprehensive response. The Bai'er Road Shou Tang, Xiang Chun Qing Yu Tang, Lafayette Road Cai Zhi Tang, Gao Chang, and Mintini Road Xiang Shan Tang, and other Chinese medicine shops, have requested representations to cancel the French Municipal Council's Public Works Bureau's collection of pharmaceutical business license fees. (Resolved) Request the Taxpayers Association to negotiate. The current free medicine clinic should be organized and opened regularly to benefit the common people. (Resolved) Follow last year's procedure. The meeting adjourned after the discussions. It was also reported that the Second Special District Citizens' Association's Executive and Supervisory Committee will present the Ji Shilin case for discussion today.</p>

<p>Recently, dog grooming companies have appeared in Shanghai, one on Yidingpan Road and one on Lafayette Road. These companies are both established by foreigners, specializing in grooming and shaving the fur of dogs of all social classes, both Chinese and foreign. As the weather is getting hotter, it is essential to cut the fur on dogs' bodies to alleviate the heat. This service is similar to a person going to a barbershop, offering various styles. The highest price per session is five yuan, followed by four yuan, three yuan, two yuan, and the lowest is one and a half yuan. The shaving takes about twenty minutes using clippers, and the dogs do not experience any pain. According to people in the industry, dogs need to be groomed at least once every three months for cleanliness, and even more frequently during the summer. Recently, this new industry has been welcomed by dogs of all social classes, who are flocking there for grooming.</p>

<p>At 2:50 AM on the morning of the other day, a fire suddenly broke out at the Dehe Tobacco Warehouse at 181 Baoshan Road, Zhabei. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade, but the entire building was destroyed and spread to several neighboring houses at 183 and 179. The North Railway Station Branch Bureau received a complaint from residents accusing the owner, Chen Senlin, of arson with the intent to claim fire insurance money. Yesterday, the branch bureau investigated and arrested Chen for questioning. Chen's testimony was evasive, and he denied setting the fire himself. The case was classified as arson and reported to the General Bureau for further investigation. The Huasheng Rice Shop, opened by Guo Zhongqing from Pudong at 84 Huaxing Road, Zhabei, caught fire at around 7 AM yesterday morning. Fortunately, the fire brigade extinguished the fire, preventing a disaster. The Mongol Road Police Station discovered that Guo was suspected of arson for insurance money and arrested him for questioning and transfer to the bureau for further investigation.</p>

The Youth Service Corps, Security Corps, Security Team, police officers, hygiene inspectors, and street sweepers have carried out citywide cleaning campaigns, labor services, public place hygiene inspections, and the hygiene offices have held public place hygiene knowledge training. All of these have been completed one after another, and the conference officially closed at 10 AM yesterday at the venue according to the original schedule. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>Yesterday's closing ceremony was simple. Conference President Li Ting'an and Preparatory Committee Chairman Shen Hao were unable to attend due to official business. The conference was presided over by General Secretary Zhu Jiarang. Representatives from various organizations and groups, including Jiang Hao, Yuan Liangzhou, Yu Da, Chen Tiesheng, Zhang Shousong, Wu Zhongyao, and Shen Qifeng, and approximately 300 members of the public were present. The order was as follows: Opening, singing the Party song, paying the highest respects to the Party, National Flag, and the portrait of the Premier, the Chairman respectfully reading the Premier's will, a moment of silence, the Chairman's report, speeches, and adjournment.</p>

Its central focus was determined to be five areas: Children's hygiene, women's and infant's hygiene, summer hygiene, public place hygiene, and labor services. Various activities were carried out based on these areas. In terms of publicity, there were two types of slogans: color-printed tin and paper.

The venue's central activities were scheduled for one type each day, with various participating organizations and groups taking responsibility, providing much guidance on children's and women's and infant's hygiene. It is estimated that over 10,000 people visited the venue each day, a thriving situation. In terms of promotion, the Security Committee, Public Security Bureau, Security Corps, Health Bureau, and New Life Movement Youth Service Corps sent over 5,000 people to carry out cleaning campaigns, labor services, and public place hygiene inspections, all of which were very effective. In summary, although this conference has come to a successful conclusion today, the enthusiastic assistance of public and private organizations, groups, individuals, and the press should be acknowledged and thanked on behalf of the conference.</p>

<p>Following this, New Life Movement Promotion Association representative Jiang Hao spoke about the importance of hygiene for individuals and the nation. Health Bureau representative Shen Qifeng spoke about the significance of the hygiene movement. Security Committee representative Yu Da spoke about summer hygiene.

In addition, all cleaning matters within this hygiene movement venue were voluntarily undertaken by the New Life Cleaning Service Company at 1100 Edward Road. Their serious work and thoughtful service are deeply appreciated, and they are recommended. If all sectors have cleaning needs, they can directly entrust them to handle them, and they will definitely be very satisfied.</p>

<p>Songpu Runs Aground While Trying to Rescue Fengpu; Remains Aground After Three Days</p>
<p>The Fengpu, a freighter of the Sanbei Company in Shanghai, weighs 191 tons, is 263 feet and 2 inches long, 38 feet and 3 inches wide, and has a draft of 16 feet and 2 inches. The ship was loaded with salt in Haizhou, heading for the Yangtze River. On June 27th, the ship was fully loaded with salt in Haizhou and set sail for the Yangtze River. When the ship reached the Sanshan area above Nanjing, near Dashengguan (navigators say that if one navigates to the north, one can pass without incident), the Fengpu pilot guided the ship on the south side. Due to the shallow water, the Fengpu</p>
<p>Suddenly Ran Aground The depth in front of the bow was measured to be only 12 feet, and the depth at the stern was only 13 feet, while the depth on the left and right sides was 16 feet. It turned out that there was a shallow sandbar there. The Fengpu was heavily loaded and had a deeper draft, (causing the ship to sink deep into the sandbar and unable to move. The shipowner, Qin Naxun, sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai to report and request rescue from upstream and downstream ships. The company's Songpu (1975 tons, 277 feet and 3 inches long, 18 feet draft) was also carrying salt from Haizhou and following behind. After the Fengpu ran aground, the Songpu received a distress signal and</p>
<p>Flew to Tow The plan was to tow the Fengpu out of the shallows. However, the shallow sandbar under Sanshan was quite large. The Songpu arrived behind the Fengpu, wanting to sail closer to tow it. However, the Songpu's draft was even deeper than the Fengpu's, and it was also fully loaded with salt, so it could not get close to the Fengpu and also ran aground. The two ships are now lined up one after the other, stranded in the middle of the river. The Songpu also has no way to escape. The Shanghai company, after receiving the report, has sent a telegram to negotiate rescue procedures. If they cannot escape on their own, they will have to hire barges to unload the cargo. Yesterday afternoon, the company received another telegram from the Fengpu, saying that the grounding was slightly looser and that they had consulted with the China Merchants Bureau.</p>

<p>Divided into Red and Plain Types with Four Denominations Can Be Redeemed for Cash at Local Post Offices Appointed Post Offices in Eighteen Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration and its affiliated branches have scheduled to start issuing Savings and Remittance Bureau gift certificates simultaneously from 9 AM today.

The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details from the bureau as follows: Simple Regulations for Issuing Gift Certificates The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's simple regulations for issuing gift certificates consist of five articles, recorded as follows: The purpose of issuing postal savings and remittance bureau gift certificates (hereinafter referred to as gift certificates) is to be used as gifts for relatives and friends at weddings, funerals, and other celebrations, to avoid the exchange of cash. After receiving these gift certificates, relatives and friends can deposit them into savings accounts or exchange them for cash at the original issuing bureau and its designated post offices in the same area. They can also be used to purchase stamps, pay electricity bills, and other postal and telecommunications transactions at designated postal and telecommunications agencies. Gift certificates are divided into four denominations: one yuan, two yuan, four yuan, and ten yuan. Their values are printed on the face of the certificate. When used or exchanged, their value is the same as national currency. Gift certificates are divided into red and plain types, and each type is equipped with a corresponding colored envelope, which is given free of charge when purchasing gift certificates. The issuance of gift certificates is anonymous. Postal and telecommunications agencies recognize the holder of the certificate as the owner of the gift certificate, so gift certificates cannot be reported lost. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is the issuer of the gift certificates, and the use and exchange of gift certificates are guaranteed by the post office.

<p>The Jiangyu Ship Will Attempt Rescue During High Tide; Whether It Will Succeed Is Unknown According to crew members from various Yangtze River ships that arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, the waters slightly north of that area are extremely deep, and Yangtze River ships can usually pass without hindrance. However, now that the Fengpu and Songpu are both aground, right in the middle of the river, and have been stranded for three days and nights without escaping, it feels particularly frustrating.</p>

<p>One Eliminates the Sender's Need for Composition, One Meets Social Needs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau announced that since the Ministry of Communications initiated social telegrams, sending them has become exceptionally popular. Considering social customs, the Ministry decided that in addition to telegrams, there is often a need to include monetary gifts.

Therefore, they specially created the social telegram with attached gift certificate procedure and pre-selected ready-made social telegram texts to facilitate their use. The above measures will be implemented starting today. Ready-made social telegrams can be sent from all branches of the city's telegraph bureau. However, social telegrams with attached gift certificates must be sent from the main telegraph bureau at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Sichuan Road or the branch office at 565 Minguo Road.

<h3 id="e118">Opium Smokers: License Renewal Period Closed Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Did Not Renew in Time May Still Voluntarily Renew</p>
<p>Regarding the city's opium smokers,</p>
<p>The deadline for the second phase of renewing opium smoking licenses expired on June 30th. A total of more than 18,000 opium smokers renewed their licenses. According to the first registration, the total number of opium smokers was 30,833, which means that one-third did not renew their licenses. Apart from those who voluntarily quit smoking and applied to cancel their licenses, there are those who did not renew their licenses due to various special reasons. Since the city is a major port for commerce, many travelers come and go, and some opium smokers are traveling abroad and unable to renew their licenses within the time limit. In order to be considerate of opium smokers, the bureau will still allow those who voluntarily come to renew their licenses afterwards to show leniency. If the bureau discovers anyone smoking privately without a license, they will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Declares Innocent Verdict in Court</p>
<p>Ruan Zhu's eight-year-old daughter, Ruan Amao, who lived in Yuehua Lane, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, was allegedly raped by her brother, Ruan Zhixiong (18 years old), at the beginning of last month. The case was transferred by the Hongkou Police Department to the First Special Court. After repeated trials, because it involved public morals, public attendance was prohibited. The case was originally scheduled to be pronounced this Monday (June 29th). However, the presiding judge, Xiao Xieifen, reviewed the entire case's testimony and noted that the Municipal Council Hospital found that the young girl's hymen had been ruptured and showed signs of venereal disease. Therefore, she reopened the debate and found that Ruan Zhu had twice accused Ruan Zhixiong of disobedience in the District Court, suggesting a negative feeling. After separate questioning, the testimonies of Ruan Amao and Ruan Zhu were inconsistent. She immediately declared the debate closed and pronounced Ruan Zhixiong not guilty in court.</p>

Qingyuan's first wife had three sons: Xien, Huien, and Qiaoen. His second wife had Enmei, Enjuan, and Enxin, three daughters who are currently studying. Qingyuan favored his second wife during his lifetime, so he put all his property under her control, and his children were not allowed to interfere. Rengao and the woman,</p>
<p>Belonging to Uncle and Sister-in-Law,</p>
<p>Completely disregarded suspicion and were unusually intimate. After Qingyuan's death, they became even more blatant and openly cohabited at 51 Bai'er Road in the French Concession, squandering Qingyuan's estate at will. Xien and his siblings knew but dared not speak out. In the summer of the year before last, seeing their mother seriously ill, fearing that once she passed away, they would not be able to investigate how much their father's estate was, they went to Dahua Hospital with their siblings to ask their stepmother. Rengao was also present. The woman, knowing she was dying,</p>
<p>Told her Children with Tears,</p>
<p>"All of your father's life savings are with your fourth uncle (referring to Rengao)." Rengao suddenly became displeased upon hearing the woman's words. Before the woman finished speaking, he interrupted with other words and immediately ordered Xien to go home with him, giving him a 50,000 yuan note. Xien knew that his father's estate was worth 100,000, so he was unwilling to accept the note for only half the amount. Rengao explained that the remaining money had been lost due to speculative business with the woman. Several days later, the woman died. Xien then took the 50,000 yuan note and demanded the money from Rengao, but Rengao repeatedly delayed. Last summer, he suddenly claimed that the note was written under duress by Xien using a gun and refused to acknowledge it. Xien felt that his uncle was trying to</p>
<p>Devour the Entire</p>
<p>Estate, and was unwilling to accept it. He joined his two brothers and three sisters to file a lawsuit against Qiu Rengao in the First Special District Court, demanding the return of the 50,000 yuan estate. A hearing was held once, but because Qiu insisted that the note was obtained by the plaintiff using violent coercion, causing criminal issues, the case was temporarily suspended. Afterwards, the uncle and nephew switched to the Shanghai District Court to fight another criminal lawsuit. Over a year has passed, the criminal case has been concluded after two trials by the Jiangsu Higher Court. Therefore,</p>
<p>The Old Matter is Raised Again,</p>
<p>Returning to the First Special Court to involve the lawsuit over the 50,000 yuan estate again. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Runhua opened a court hearing. The defendant, Qiu Rengao, did not appear, and a lawyer appeared on his behalf. The plaintiffs, Xien, Huien, and Qiaoen brothers, and Enjuan and Enxin sisters, all presented themselves. Only Enmei was sick at home and could not attend. Xie Xien spoke on behalf of his siblings, briefly recounting the old situation, stating that his late father's property was entrusted to the defendant and his stepmother for management, totaling 80,000 in cash and land worth 20,000. The defendant and his stepmother had cohabited on Bai'er Road. After the stepmother died, her jewelry was also taken away. Therefore, in addition to suing for the return of the 50,000 yuan estate, all jewelry should also be returned. This case was previously mediated by Qian Zhongxiao and Chen Wencan,</p>
<p>Lawyer Mediation,</p>
<p>Requesting that those two be summoned to court, and they would be able to testify, etc. The defendant's lawyer immediately stated that the plaintiff's stepmother had previously divided more than 10,000 in cash among her three daughters, and the money was stored in the Xinkang Pawnshop on Broadway, which was opened by her maternal family. He also presented a note of 1,000 yuan that the plaintiff borrowed from his sister, stating that this was sufficient to show that the three daughters had already received cash. However, the plaintiff claimed that the Xinkang Pawnshop was not opened by his maternal family and that no money was stored there, and requested that the criminal case files be retrieved from the Shanghai District Court for verification. Judge Mo then ordered a change of date to July 16th in the morning for another hearing.</p>

<p>Luo Fu Had a Husband, and the Envoy Had a Wife; Secret Love Could Not Last, Attempted Suicide by Poison and Were Saved</p>
<p>On June 25th, a middle-aged man and a young woman arrived at the Jincheng Hotel on Hankou Road and booked Room No. 2. The man claimed to be Zhao Yongbi, 36 years old, from Ningbo, and the woman was Cui Zhou, 19 years old. They were inseparable for days and extremely intimate. Observing their actions and laughter, they seemed like newlyweds. Even when they occasionally went out, they always went together. Unexpectedly, at around 1:30 AM yesterday morning, the tea server suddenly heard moaning and sobbing coming from the room, arousing great suspicion. He tried knocking on the door but received no response, so he managed to open the door and enter. He found both of them lying on the bed, with tears in their eyes, pale faces, and rapid breathing. However, they were still conscious. When asked why, they vaguely refused to answer. However, he glimpsed an empty container of poison, and he realized they had taken poison. He quickly reported to the police, who sent them to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was mild, and they were saved. After questioning, they claimed that Zhao Yongbi was a fishmonger and already had a wife at home, while Cui Zhou was also already married. The two of them were united by secret love, and their passion reached a breaking point. Because it was difficult for their relationship to last, they attempted suicide by poison together.</p>

<p>Shanghai, a large metropolis with towering buildings, rarely has mosquitoes in the summer. However, this year is different. Since the beginning of summer, mosquitoes have been rampant in areas such as South Shanghai, Zhabei, West Shanghai, and the British and French Concessions. They cannot be eliminated by swatting or chasing away. Their buzzing sound continues all night, not only disturbing people's sleep but also significantly affecting citizens' health. According to medical experts, malignant malaria will likely become widespread this year. Citizens should take precautions.</p>

<p>Official Order Sent to Renji Orphanage for Care</p>
<p>At 1 PM on the 28th of this month, a man and a woman arrived at the Longsheng Hotel at No. 6, Lane 446, Fuzhou Road and booked Room No. 26. The man spoke with a Ningbo accent, was about 30 years old, and claimed to be Wang Zhichang. The woman's name was unknown. The two of them were dressed neatly. At the time, the woman was holding a child in her arms. They stayed for one night. At 3 PM the day before yesterday, the man and woman suddenly went out at the same time, not taking the child with them. When the tea server asked why they weren't taking the child with them, they replied that they would be back soon, so there was no need to take it out. By 7 PM that evening, the man and woman had not returned, and the child was crying non-stop. The hotel reported this to the Lao Zha Police Department, and Officer He Lianzeng was ordered to investigate. He saw a red cloth on the child's leg with the words "Wang Meimei, born at 7:15 AM on June 20th." It was clear that this child was an illegitimate child and that they would never return to claim it. Therefore, he took the child to the police station and fed it milk. Yesterday morning, he applied to the First Special District Court for disposal. After Judge Shen inquired about the situation, he ordered the child to be sent to the Renji Orphanage for care.</p>

<p>Some Claim to Have Closed; Some Sold to Japanese</p>
<p>Because of the establishment of dance schools which resemble dance halls by selling dance tickets without applying for licenses, the Public Concession Municipal Council ordered all police stations to crack down on them. The Far East Women's Travel Agency, Da Shanghai, Peach Blossom River, Hao Le, Central, and New Xin dance schools were prosecuted by the police and punished by the court. However, most dance schools are still unaware of the need for reform and continue to sell dance tickets as before. Recently, the Xin Dalu Dance School at 548 Fuzhou Road, the Peach Blossom River Dance School in Taichang Building at 430 Zhejiang Road, and the Tao Tao Dance School at 852 Beijing Road were found selling dance tickets by Deputy Detective Zhang Mingde of the Lao Zha Police Department. The police prosecuted the heads of these three dance schools, Wu Ziliang, Tan Zhixiong, and Pan Guangliang. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen of the First Special Court's Arrest Police Court summoned them. Wu Ziliang of Xin Dalu did not appear and was ordered to be summoned again at a later date. Pan Guangliang of Tao Tao claimed that it had closed since June 26th, and the court ordered a change of date and ordered the police to investigate whether this was true before verifying it. Tan Zhixiong of Peach Blossom River claimed that the school had been sold to a Japanese, Endo Takato, for 2,500 yuan on the 8th of this month and presented a sale agreement as proof. Judge Shen ordered the police to investigate and change the date of this case for further verification.</p>

<p>More than 200 New Oil and Traditional Paintings; Liu's Work "Eagle Sea"</p>
<p>Contemporary painting master Liu Haisu (engaging in the New Art Movement for 28 years, Chinese painting history reached a major turning point with Mr. Liu. In 1929, he first toured Europe and exhibited calligraphy and paintings in Paris, and the French government purchased his paintings for the museum. The great writer Louis Laloy wrote an article calling him "The Master of the Chinese Renaissance." In 1933, Mr. Liu went to Europe for the second time to exhibit paintings, traveling through more than ten countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Czechoslovakia, taking three years. He was welcomed enthusiastically everywhere he went, and the public opinion was excellent. German scholars Professor Quimai and Professor Frank, and the British critic Roland Spence, highly praised him, truly opening a new era never seen before internationally. The Berlin Daily and the London Times repeatedly published special articles on Mr. Liu's art, saying that if China had such culture and such creation, it would be irrational for us to attempt invasion. The German and French governments specially opened rooms in the Berlin and Paris National Museums to display Mr. Liu's works. His brilliance still shines before the Europeans. In addition to exhibiting paintings, Mr. Liu also worked hard at creation. He returned to China last autumn and went to Mount Huang and other scenic spots to continue producing works. He has collected 300 new works (the content is divided into two parts: traditional Chinese paintings and oil paintings, many of which were created in Berlin, London, Paris, Switzerland, and after returning to China) to hold a second European tour exhibition in Shanghai. It opens today at the New Building on the fourth floor of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road, and will be exhibited for fifteen days. The opening ceremony will be hosted by President Cai of the Academia Sinica at 4 PM, and Mayor Wu will be invited to unveil it. Tea parties have also been invited for famous people and people from all walks of life at home and abroad. Minister of Education Wang Shijie wrote a preface, saying, "Mr. Haisu inherited the family tradition and made years of efforts. He has already integrated ancient and modern famous paintings and is valued by the world. He is still not modest and believes that he has not exhausted the world's spectacle and is not enough to show his talent. Therefore, he has traveled across the oceans again and again, and has visited famous monuments in countries such as England, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland, and has extensively read Greek and Roman literature, combining realism and charm in one furnace to complete his unique style. While traveling and writing, he depicts the strange landscapes, magnificent buildings, and complex social conditions of Europe in his paintings. His masterpieces have been exhibited in European countries and major cities in our country, and have been greatly praised by celebrities at home and abroad. The Berlin and Paris Museums of Art have also opened special rooms to display his works, which is a special event in the international art world. Now he is opening an exhibition of his second European tour works in Shanghai, and those who view it can see the arduousness of his struggle and the ability to create, and his works must be respected and inspired. It is estimated that the opening of this meeting will not only increase the author's personal honor, but also have a great impact on the development of Chinese painting art. Therefore, I write a few words to introduce it to the world."</p>

<p>Mr. Li Zhuangshou, technical expert of the National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee and full-time researcher at the National Central Research Institute's Cotton Textile Dyeing Experimental Hall, was dispatched in January of last year to lead technicians Li Xuerui, Deng Hengxing, Cai Gufu, Liu Yujun, and others to Japan for study. They have all returned to China one after another in the past year and a half. Mr. Li graduated from the Dyeing and Weaving Department of Kiryu Advanced Industrial School in Japan. He used to be an engineer at Hengfeng Textile New Bureau. He currently holds this position. Because he felt the decline of the domestic textile industry, he unloaded his heavy responsibility and concentrated on research. He spent the longest time studying with Toyota Automatic Loom Works, Central Textile Co., Ltd., Toyota Textile Co., Ltd., and Enshu Automatic Loom Manufacturing Co., Ltd. He had a detailed investigation of the affairs of new-style factories. He also paid special attention to the factory. He then went to visit the newest factories in various parts of the country. With the advanced nature of the textile industry in that country and Mr. Li's spirit of hard work, he has now returned fully loaded, and will definitely contribute to the textile industry in our country.</p>

<h3 id="e149">The Nanhua Industry of Shanghai <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>1.  Development: The Nanhua industry of Shanghai dates back to the Daoguang era of the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, the areas inside and outside the city walls were extremely desolate and sparsely populated. The scope of the first businesses was small, only dealing in oil, wine, porridge, soy sauce, incense, candles, paper horses, etc., which were commonly known as grocery stores. However, the area east of the Dawang Temple on Guajie Street on the Bund was relatively lively because it was close to the Huangpu River, with convenient boat traffic. As more residents moved in, merchants established markets, and after 30 years of hard work, the area gradually became a bustling street. During the Xianfeng era, the area expanded to Laoma Road, and the areas from 60th Avenue to Dongjiadu also became market areas. Business grew year by year, and by the Tongzhi era, it had become the most prosperous street. It is said that large-scale Nanhua stores such as Tongfeng, Tongtai, Laotaisheng, Xintaisheng, Tongfa, Nansanmao, Beisanmao, Hongtai, and Xiantai were established, specializing in famous domestic products from various provinces, including southern and northern groceries, Fujian and Guangdong brown sugar, Guanshan peaches and dates, and Eastern and Western ocean products (i.e., Western seafood), providing everything needed by society. The first entrepreneurs were the Zhou family from Huzhou. Later, the number of businesses increased, and there were two groups: the Huzhou group and the local group. However, the Huzhou group accounted for most of the industry, so it was considered the top group in the industry.</p>
<p>2.  Scope of the Nanhua Industry and Its Relationship with Beihuo: China is a vast country with abundant resources. Therefore, the scope of southern and northern goods is quite broad. Products from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong are called Nanhua (Southern goods). Products from Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, etc., are called Beihuo (Northern goods). However, people generally refer to Nanhua stores and rarely refer to Beihuo stores. There is a reason for this. In the late Qing Dynasty, the main business of Nanhua stores was red and white sugar. The source of sugar was mainly from Fujian and Guangdong, and also from Taiwan. At that time, Taiwan had not been occupied by Japan and was part of southern China. Therefore, it was called Fujian, Guangdong, and Taiwan sugar. As a result, it became a common practice to simply call them Nanhua stores.</p>
<p>3.

<p>And Must Not Use Unapproved Books or Have Children Copy Fragmented Materials</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 30th) – The Ministry of Education has ordered all provincial and municipal education bureaus that the new elementary school teaching subjects, weekly teaching schedule, and common knowledge curriculum standards have been announced by the Ministry. The elementary school textbooks for the three subjects of society, nature, and hygiene, which were edited by various publishers according to the old standards, are no longer valid. Hereafter, elementary schools must not continue to use them. Furthermore, civic training is a form of moral education that is implemented in practice, and there is absolutely no need to use textbooks. All civic training textbooks published by various publishers must not be used by elementary schools. It is hereby ordered that this be known and passed on to all subordinate elementary schools for compliance.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education also ordered all provincial and municipal education bureaus that elementary school textbooks and books should use the versions approved by the Ministry, as has been clearly stipulated. Recently, it has been found that some elementary schools in various regions have failed to fully comply, or have arbitrarily used unapproved versions or self-compiled textbooks without approval, or have not used textbooks at all, but instead have had children copy fragmented materials. The errors in the materials are too numerous to count, which is a violation of regulations and harms children's learning. Hereafter, elementary schools should each choose textbooks and books that have been approved by the Ministry, except for those specifically permitted by the Ministry. In addition to self-compiled supplementary materials, they must not use unapproved self-compiled textbooks, and must not constantly have children copy fragmented materials. School inspectors and supervisors should strictly review and inspect, and if they encounter situations where unapproved versions and unapproved self-compiled textbooks are being used, they should correct them. Those who do not comply may be requested by the competent educational administrative organ to discipline their principals or directors. It is hereby ordered that this be known and passed on to all subordinates for compliance.</p>

Two photos, a certificate stamp fee of three yuan, a letter of guarantee, and a bank or agency deposit certificate are required. The documents required in Europe and the United States are the same as in Japan, but there is no need to submit a deposit certificate. The procedures for applying for a passport are relatively simple. If there is anything unclear, you can inquire with the association for all information.</p>
<p>Latest Departure Date for Europe is August</p>
<p>Students going to Europe this year must depart no later than early August, as the academic year in European universities always begins in mid-October or early November.

How to do it? In my opinion, there are several items below.</p>
<p>Organize National Products Propaganda Groups: Promoting national products requires a strong emphasis on propaganda. During the summer vacation, young students can contact nearby classmates or ambitious young people from their hometown to organize a national products propaganda group. They can go out to promote national products once a day or every other day, so that their fellow villagers deeply understand the importance of promoting national products and recognize the dangers of using foreign goods. I believe that with the students' sincere attitude, fluent speech, and exemplary spirit, the results of this national products propaganda group will be considerable.</p>
<p>Inspect Household Items: Promoting national products must start from the family, and then it will have a significant effect. Many families can buy and use national products, but there are also many who are misled and mistakenly use foreign goods. During the summer vacation, young students can inspect the items in their homes. Which are national products? Which are not national products? A standard must be set, and the products of various national products factories, as well as their trademarks and addresses, should be promoted. In this way, most of the things used in the family in the future will surely be able to abandon foreign goods and buy national products.</p>
<p>Promote the Situation of Smuggling: The problem of smuggling is now really serious! How can we make the general public recognize the seriousness of smuggling? How can we make the general public determined not to buy smuggled goods? Not to use smuggled goods? This is a very important issue at present. Young students should use their summer vacation to conduct a general propaganda on the issue of smuggling, so that tens of thousands of people in various places can unanimously know the seriousness of smuggling and advise each other not to buy smuggled goods. This is a very urgent matter.</p>
<p>In short, the national crisis is so critical, and the national products industry is so precarious. You promising young students should spend your time during the summer vacation in a serious manner. How can it be enough to only work hard for the National Products Movement!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Contributing to the Promotion Group of National Products <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The development of national products depends half on manufacturing and half on promotion. The responsibility of manufacturing rests with the factories, and the responsibility of promotion rests with everyone. The organization of national products promotion groups is especially powerful. The mission of a national products promotion group has four points:</p>
<p>Go to each school to promote student supplies, taking the opportunity to promote the main points of promoting and using national products.</p>
<p>Go to each household to promote household goods, spread throughout the residences of each alley and each neighborhood, and have sincere talks with housewives. Make them thoroughly understand the benefits of using national products, and get used to using national products, and establish a very good relationship with each other. From then on, if each family does not use goods, then so be it, but if they do use goods, they must wait for the promoters to come to their door.</p>
<p>Go to each village and each village, so that the general public knows that national products are exquisite and more beneficial than using foreign goods, and cultivate the spirit that rural people "do not use national products if they are not national products, and do not use national products if they are not national products."</p>
<p>Go to various institutions, groups, and factories and shops in industry and commerce, and persuade clerks, shop assistants, workers, and apprentices to use national products, so as to avoid the unemployment of workers and the collapse of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The promotion of national products must have the phenomenon of mercury pouring on the ground, entering everywhere. Then the territory of national products will become wider day by day, and the livelihood of national products will become more and more. There are four conditions for promoters:</p>
<p>(1) Be able to endure hardship and suffering, especially be able to hold your breath.</p>
<p>(2) Be able to have in-depth skills, adapt to the situation, speak the language of the school when you arrive at the school, talk about the situation of the family when you go to the family, talk about supplements when you see the elderly, and look at toys when you see children. This is the skill that promoters should have. It is heard that a certain promoter is good at this method, and can do 30 yuan of business every day.</p>
<p>(3) Be able to investigate, where you are used to using a certain thing, where you are used to eating a certain product, cater to people's preferences, and suit people's tastes. This kind of skill is indispensable.</p>
<p>(4) Comply with social psychology, say a certain word when you arrive at a certain place, and when you sell a certain product, you should test the authenticity of the product. Especially, you must start from the psychology of the masses. In short, it is easy to deal with things, but difficult to deal with things, but I don't know that it is more difficult to deal with people. The saying that conforms to social psychology seems easy, but it is very difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Now Kangyuan Canned Food Factory has also adopted the method of withdrawing promoters, entrusting the China Vocational Education Society to handle it. It is beneficial to manufacturers without any harm, and it can also maintain thousands and hundreds of unemployed people, so that users can get safe and satisfactory products, and everyone who is unemployed has something to do. This is the fundamental problem of solving the unemployed, and it must not be regarded as a hopeless work. This promising future is in the golden rule of promoters. I hope that manufacturers will continue to believe in it to benefit the unemployed compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e184">"Summer" and National Products <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The progression of time has not been slowly supported and slipped away because of our "economic national crisis." When we see the temperature of the thermometer rising day by day, and modern girls have already put on Qiao Qisha cheongsams, and parade on the streets with their bare toes, we know that the summer of the "National Products Year for Citizens" has come again.</p>
<p>Summer is a period of great change in the climate. People's lives are affected by it and they rush to purchase all kinds of summer supplies. Therefore, at this time, the colorful selection of goods in various shops and companies, and the increase in customers wearing shoes, all fully demonstrate the magic of "summer." However, here, I seem to be nervously thinking again, according to past facts and experiences, under the national's widespread worship of foreign goods psychology, the beginning of that summer is precisely giving foreign goods a good opportunity to dump their goods. Like imported and georgette yarns and silk fabrics! Soda! Beer! Dark fragrance! Electric fans! Straw hats! T-shirts! These many things are about to be very active in our country's market at this time, scouring a huge amount of our great money. Therefore, in the face of the current national economy, which is even weaker, and the national crisis is becoming more and more serious, we must shout loudly, "Don't buy a cent of foreign goods again, losing a cent of national vitality. Buying one more cent of national products is to increase the country's strength by one cent." Come:</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to introduce several kinds of national products that are essential for summer, and I dare to contribute to people who are purchasing summer items, such as the various summer fabrics, towels and bath towels of Sanyou Industrial Society, and the goose brand T-shirts of Wuhe Weaving Factory in terms of clothing. In terms of utensils, such as Samsung mosquito coils, Huasheng electric fans, Lihe brand washbasins, laundry basins, Huafu straw hats, and Wuzhou Yalin anti-epidemic water. In terms of diet, such as Yantai beer, Yili soda, and Guansheng cold food canned food. These many well-known and popular national products have long been happily used by society, so there is no need to describe them one by one. However, at the end of this article, the author hopes with the greatest enthusiasm that all compatriots in the country, in the present situation where private goods are flooding the country and dumping goods wildly, must not eat the small cheapness, and leave behind the hatred of destroying the country, but should urgently love national products, develop industry and commerce, and save the crisis of the dying national economy.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Talking About the Efficacy of Tianli Ammonia <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Clerks working in writing rooms, because they work at their desks from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, feel uncomfortable in body and mind, and their minds are dizzy and extremely tired. In this situation, if you just smell the ammonia a little, then you can immediately refresh your mind and turn into an energetic person. Working can achieve the effect of "doing more with less effort." It is the only stimulant that does not stimulate the heart or hurt the nervous system.</p>
<p>When bathing with "Tianli Ammonia," the whole body is dirty and can be washed thoroughly, and the skin is smooth, and you feel exceptionally comfortable. On the one hand, it can increase the skin's resistance... In the hot summer, every family cannot do without it.</p>
<p>Household ammonia is especially liked by people with beards. Because ammonia can gradually soften the beard, and it can also reduce the number of shavings. Also, when the shaving blade is blunt, just soak it in Tianli Ammonia for a few seconds, and then wipe it dry, then the blade will be as sharp as new.</p>
<p>Adding half a grid of ammonia to the hot water in the foot basin, soaking and washing it before going to bed can make you feel comfortable and fall asleep. It can be said to be an essential medicine for people suffering from insomnia.</p>
<p>After being bitten by mosquitoes or poisonous insects, immediately apply ammonia, which can relieve pain, detoxify and reduce swelling in an instant.</p>
<p>Pour half a grid of "Tianli Ammonia" (do not mix with water) in the room to make the air clean. If it is in a sick room, then you can avoid the transmission of bacteria.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that plants can regulate gas and carbonic acid gas, and flowers can make people feel happy and have a pleasant feeling, so plants and flowers seem to have a close relationship that cannot be separated from human life. But how should we protect it? That is to mix a little ammonia with a gallon of water to irrigate the roots of plants and flowers, watering it twice a week (do not interrupt).</p>
<p>Using "Tianli Ammonia" to wash silk and woolen fabrics has the following special effects: Does not turn yellow, does not fade, has a lovely luster, does not damage the material, is easy to dry, and does not shrink.</p>
<p>Ammonia also has a great effect on women's hair washing. It can remove all the grease and dirt from the hair and make it shiny and lustrous. Used for laundry, "it removes dirt and dirt far better than soap," and it saves all kinds of trouble, which is more convenient than using soap powder.</p>
<p>"Bright windows and clean desks" This is how clean and happy a family is. As for how to make the windows bright and the desks clean? Then it is to apply "Tianli Ammonia" which will definitely guarantee your "satisfaction."</p>
<p>There are many other uses, but I can't describe them all one by one here due to space limitations. I hope that compatriots in the country will buy more "excellent national products" so that the national industry can be fully developed, and on the one hand, the national economy can be enriched through the efforts of several national products manufacturers and the people's adoption as much as possible.</p>

<p>— Chen Cuina</p>
<p>Boating</p>
<p>Light rain has a sunny intent, the lake and sky are blue at a glance, the water is deep and the oars are heavy, the duckweed is full and the fish are abundant, spring bamboo shoots suddenly grow tall, white clouds close to a hermitage, compose poems and live as you please, do not be greedy for obtaining sentences.</p>
<p>I occasionally said that I lived in West Lake, and the second brother echoed, saying, I haven't left the house for years, just to complete a poem.</p>
<p>Living in West Lake, I haven't left the house, grass grows and the secluded path is narrow, people are quiet and birds are noisy, the wild water is so green, the white lotus is naturally fragrant, in the evening a pot of wine, also next to the apricot flower village.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Frog Sounds in the Wild Water <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>After a heavy rain all night, the curtain waves are like snow. I vaguely think that in the recorded place of rice fields, the frog sounds should be shaking with anger. My hometown has a saying, "Many frogs mean the rice is ripe, and much rain makes the silkworm women cry." The frogs can eat the locust nymphs, and the farmers verify the abundance of the harvest by the tiny insects, which is more reliable than the divination of the gods. Therefore, I made a law for myself, and the prohibition of capture is very strict. Every time at the turn of spring and summer, I let them play in the ponds and wild waters. Fortunately, they are competing with bream and carp to ascend the knife and chopping board. The canals and banks in Shanghai are filled, and the aquatic plants are all lost. This sound is no longer available. Only in the remote fields, passing by under the moon, can I still vaguely hear it in my ears. It should be said that frogs are also one of the migratory insects, calling for spring farming, no less than the cricket urging the lazy woman. Once a year, the people's livelihood is depended on. However, the bustling city is floating and frivolous, indulging in erotic songs and drowning in decadent sounds. Who knows that more than ten miles away, there is this sound of nature? Is it not sad that for a long time it has been abandoned, and that people are ignorant of farming and do not care about it?</p>
<p>Frogs respond to the agricultural season, and also cooperate with ancient poems: "Artemisia is full of the ground, and the buds are short," this is when the tadpoles are active; "Peach blossoms are gone and rape flowers are yellow," then it is when the ponds are noisy. After the new rain has just stopped, the wet moon flows yellow, so that sitting in a virtual hall and listening quietly, all the sounds from near and far respond to each other, like a noisy drum, warning and competing; if the general's order is strict, the soldiers are angry and strong; its spirit is majestic, its sound is strong, and it cannot be compared with the autumn insects' taste of sorrow and coolness. Therefore, seeing that at night after finishing class by the window, enjoying the complex sounds, throwing down the pen and making a color, I am self-righteous, not counting Zu Sheng hearing the rooster crow. Now that the world has been fed, and the spring dreams have all awakened, and I am staying by the lake, hearing this sound and stroking my head, all kinds of feelings gather: the seasons flow around, my ambition has not been fulfilled, I sit and watch the remnant lamp flowers, and I sigh and ask what to do!</p>
<p>Although frogs are insects, they have a habitat, and they are quiet at night, not worrying about being attacked, which is close to skill. Frogs that are floating on the algae are colored, and frogs that are spotted are padded on the bank or tree roots, concealing themselves, and blinding the eyes, which is close to wisdom. If they are angry, they will stimulate the decadent energy, and then they will be great courage. In this bleak autumn of storms, how can we capture ten thousand angry frogs and divide them into the corridors, so that those who are like King Yue can use them as a model, and those who have courage among the scholars and commoners can be moved by them and rise up, and perhaps there is something that can be done!</p>
<p>Shen Yishi in Jiangwan raises frogs the most. He opened up land and built a house, surrounded by fences, and three ponds in the middle. Except for the thin planting of flowers and plants on the shore, the reed water is full of green-bellied and green-backed toads. When it is sunny, there are cloud shadows and sky light, pouring into the blue waves, and the frogs are swimming or jumping, scattering into the remaining beauty. He sighs at the wonderful taste of Hao Liang, and it is not more than this. At night, the dark flowers bear dew, and the water surface is slightly eroded, as if dense stars are swallowed, and they are shaking their tongues and stirring up waves. I have been to his place twice, and I have enjoyed all the pleasures. There are species collected from the Americas, so large that they are comparable to crouching civets, and Westerners are sold happily, each pair can earn more than five gold. The feed can find its own aquatic insects, without the need for feeding. In ancient times, there were those who played with cranes to the end of their lives, and this is hidden in frogs. Building a house in the human realm, without the disturbance of cars and horses, although it is said to be secluded and barren, there are also trumpets, so why must you leave the deep mountains and bid farewell to the secular world before you can get it?</p>
<h3 id="e189">Trip to Qingyang Port <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>On a Sunday morning, I followed friends to Qingyang Port to watch the dragon boat races, hoping to dispel the accumulated boredom from long seclusion in the city.</p>
<p>The weather that day was neither cold nor too hot; truly, one could say the sky was clear and the breeze gentle. Advancing in the light of the rising sun, chatting and laughing, the wheels had already left Shanghai and plunged into the embrace of nature. The expanse of green outside the car window drew our gaze, the yellow wheat waves breaking through all the gray impressions in our minds, startling us with the realization that the season had turned to wheat harvesting and rice planting.</p>
<p>The wheels mechanically rolled past several stations, finally spitting us out of the carriage at our destination. It was quite surprising; there were already many gentlemen and ladies wandering by the river and in the fields. Ah, perhaps these were people who had escaped from the city at the first opportunity to spend their so-called weekends in this place. Indeed, even in this rural area, there are "hotel" like places for noble gentlemen and ladies to rest their horses and feet.</p>
<p>Our group of three, all pretending to be poets, lay in the wheat waves for a while, sat under the green shade for a while, and strolled along the Qingyang Port, heads bowed. The sun shone through the transparent air, and the three of us took several deep breaths, inhaling the fresh air that cost nothing.</p>
<p>The dragon boat race began. Ten boats advanced with drums and music in the calm Qingyang Port, earning applause from the audience on both sides of the river. Even more so, a group of nearly twenty female students jumped with rhythmic steps, encouraging the rowers with rhythmic tunes to move forward, to strive forward.</p>
<p>At noon, we ate at a small rural restaurant, consuming fresh fish and shrimp, which, although simple and unadorned, tasted very delicious. Old Hu, who was with us, spent one yuan in legal currency to buy two large carp and a pound of lively fresh shrimp to take home to his wife as proof of his trip.</p>
<p>After the meal, we strolled around the countryside for a while, and a little before three o'clock, we climbed back into the belly of the train. Quite coincidentally, those nearly twenty female students were also riding in this carriage. With nearly twenty lively and beautiful angels in one carriage, the air was filled with a rosy atmosphere.</p>
<p>Crisp laughter, mixed with the beautiful songs of famous English tunes, drew the attention of all the passengers to a corner of the carriage where more than a dozen large straw hats floated.</p>
<p>The train advanced rhythmically in the soft sunlight, and before we knew it, it had slowly been pulled into the platform of the Shanghai North Station.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Journey to the Water Towns <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Both banks are deep green, and the water is also deep green. The long, flowing water carries finely woven duckweed, slowly following the June wind, floating past my eyes and disappearing behind me.</p>
<p>"Aren't people like duckweed, drifting on the surface of the world?" I don't know where this piercing question came from. Looking at the curved banks and the villages hidden in the dense shade, sitting on the bow of the boat, puffing out faint smoke rings, a sense of茫然 and flow of the water, washed over me. Wild roses laughed on the shore, white and pink, but the withered flowers, petal after petal, fell on the mud by the water, forever burying its color, its fragrance, its everything that was pleasing……</p>
<p>So, I dare not turn my head to look at Terry in the cabin. She is a woman who has been trampled on by life in the dusty world, with the color of wild roses, the fragrance of wild roses, but these days will probably not last long, blown by the great wind of life into the mud-like destiny, forever burying her.</p>
<p>The weeping willows gently brushed the water, and three or five village children, ignoring the mud over their knees, were exploring for their beloved fresh treasures, only a few small crabs. That kind of smile moved my fragile heartstrings. Doesn't the world have many people who spend their whole lives treading in the mud to seek the true meaning of life?——In the June wind, the boat slowly turned around the bend.</p>
<p>Again, long green banks, again, long green water, again, duckweed floating by.</p>
<p>But I felt the loneliness of the water towns. Terry was singing the enthusiastic "Indian Folk Song" in the cabin. Unexpectedly, she even showed a smile that didn't know bitterness. Quietly, she lit another cigarette, took a puff, two puffs...smoking, not caring about the boatman behind, who knows where he was rowing us to.</p>

<p>Chapter 3: Light Rain and Slanting Wind Still Leave Traces; Silent Night, Writing a Letter of Severance</p>
<p>When he ran into her, his attitude was very comfortable and he didn't look like a sick person. But he didn't have an angry look, and he didn't seem to be angry with anyone. This girl's attitude has to be said to be unpredictable. During this week, he had another way to solve this difficulty. It turned out that he had used this courage on the tip of his pen and written a letter, which he sent to Luo Lan's school. When Menglan went to school, the gatekeeper sent the letter over. She saw a layered, printed envelope with a very delicate handwriting on it: Miss Jiang Menglan, Zhenkun Girls' School, kindly opened. The signature below read: Zhang Jian, this city. As soon as Menglan saw it, she couldn't help but feel a flurry of excitement in her heart. She said, "This is a letter from the Women's Normal School. Miss Zhang didn't come, she's writing a letter for fun." Saying this, she looked around to see if anyone was around, quickly took the letter and walked to a quiet place on campus. Seeing that no one was nearby, she sat on a short railing under a clump of banana trees, with her back to the pedestrians, and read the letter. The letter read:</p>
<p>Miss Menglan: I am suddenly presumptuous to send you this letter. I know I am being presumptuous. However, in today's society, with the advancement of culture, male and female interactions are seen as equal, which is common in Western customs. You are studying at a school run by Westerners, so you may excuse my behavior by Western customs; however, my admiration is sincere. I am not talented, and I earn a living by writing to support my mother. I know I am mediocre and not valued by the literati. But for the past two months, every time I meet you on the road, I feel as if I am bathed in the clear air of the light wind and misty moon. I don't know why, but I feel like a sunflower facing the sun, unable to suppress my inclination. However, I have only caught a glimpse and have not yet asked you directly. Later, I saw you holding a popular magazine with my humble writings published on the cover. I then realized that my shallow works have long been appreciated by your discerning eyes. In ancient times, people who found a confidant could die without regret. I dare not insult your orchid-like qualities by calling you a confidante. However, I admire you and cannot remain silent. Also, I thought that a cautious person like me could not express my feelings. I was worried and didn't know what to do. A few days ago, I visited a distant relative who has a younger sister studying at your school. Accidentally, I read the yearbook of your school at her home. Your beautiful photo and name were both there. So I was able to take advantage of this postal route to present this short letter. If you can forgive my rashness and allow me to correspond with you, then we can exchange ideas and improve each other's writing between the paper and ink. My words are sincere, and I dare not hope for anything else. I happened to collect a line from an ancient poem: "I am a melancholy guest in this world, meeting you again in the season of falling flowers." This feeling, this scene, the fourteen characters cannot express all that I feel, so this letter has lingered in my mind for two days and nights, half-written and placed in my bosom for another day and night, and finally I sent it. Even if I offend you, I have no choice, right? Respectfully presented, I am anxiously awaiting your reply. Zhang Guoqi (42)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e194">Random Thoughts on Rural Living <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>There are many people who are constantly advocating "going to the countryside." However, if you pay attention to where they live, they are still living in magnificent Western-style houses on some street, which is the same ridiculous thing as friends who promote domestic products every day, but wear imported Western suits themselves.</p>
<p>In truth, the air in the countryside is too good, but unfortunately, transportation is ultimately inconvenient. If you are a solitary person who doesn't like being enthusiastic, living there is very suitable. However, good air cannot be exchanged for bread. Now, the real rural people always want to run to the city.</p>
<p>I have been living in the countryside for about two years, and I don't feel any inconvenience in my habits. My frail body has actually become stronger, which proves the benefits of nature in the countryside being suitable for human life. Take the mosquitoes in the summer, for example, they are much stronger than those in the city. And their activity time is also longer. The buzzing of the mosquito swarm starts in May and won't be heard until the end of October. If I hadn't prepared the Invincible brand mosquito incense from the family industry cooperative last year, then perhaps I would have "returned to the city" long ago.</p>
<p>Last summer, one rainy day, the Invincible brand was used up, and I bought two new brands. I really suffered for a whole night without being able to close my eyes. Some of our neighbors use mosquito nets, but they are still useless. Some light locally made mosquito smoke sticks, which are very strong, and people cough when they smell them, so now they have also switched to the inexpensive and high-quality Invincible brand.</p>
<p>These days, it's the season of the mold, and the weather is so humid. For someone with my kind of heavy moisture, my stomach often feels sluggish. I usually like to drink light tea, but these days, I don't dare to drink light tea because I consulted a doctor who said that light tea is most likely to generate moisture. It accumulates over time and you don't feel it much. As long as the humid season comes, drinking light tea, especially for someone with a moist body, will make it even worse.</p>
<p>But for someone who is used to drinking tea, it's as if they have a very hard time if they don't touch their lips to water all day long. Moreover, I often have to run around in the hot sun. After sweating like crazy, my throat feels even more thirsty. The doctor told me to use Job's tears and tangerine peel instead of tea, but it's not very palatable and doesn't quench my thirst. For example, drinking plain boiled water seems bland and tasteless, and chrysanthemum and black tea don't suit my taste. It's funny, but it seems very difficult to solve this small drinking problem.</p>
<p>The year before last, my wife bought two bottles of fruit juice. The taste was sweet and fragrant. When mixed with cold boiled water, it was very thirst-quenching. I drank it a few times and my appetite felt better. Later, one summer, I didn't want to eat any cold drinks (because of the moisture, eating soda or ice cream would make my stomach feel sluggish and sick). I specialized in eating fruit juice, with the feeling that "I can't live without this gentleman for a day."</p>
<p>Over the past two or three years, I can distinguish the good and bad of fruit juice very clearly. Among them, those that don't mix saccharin and don't use raw water, and don't dry out my throat after eating, I trust the Guanshengyuan brand as more pure in domestic products, because imported goods are too expensive. If you are greedy for cheapness, you will inevitably buy things with saccharin and raw water.</p>
<p>Now, summer has arrived again. Although I live in a remote and poor countryside, for me, mosquito incense and fruit juice are indispensable and must be bought early.</p>

However, internal staff must work as usual, and are even busier than usual. Generally, all accounts must be closed at the end of yesterday. However, this year, due to market conditions, the amount of inflow and outflow is slightly less than last year, so the procedures are less tedious. However, the closing date for external businesses stipulates that foreign banks and large Chinese and foreign member banks are mostly closed for three days, and only open on the 4th. Ordinary Chinese (non-member) banks are only closed for two days and start to resume their old status on the 3rd.</p>

<p>——Market Prices Fall Two or Three Jiao to Five or Six Jiao——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange had a two-day holiday due to the exchange's semi-annual settlement period on July 1st and 2nd. In the market, most of the floating long and short positions were temporarily closed to avoid danger. There were also rumors that made the long positions slightly weaker. However, the news from Guangdong and Guangxi has been very depressing in recent days, and there have been no new developments. Although the situation at the front is extremely critical, peace has not been completely despaired of. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee will be held soon, which is extremely important. Yesterday, after the opening, No. 43 absorbed quite a lot, and Class E suddenly rose by 1.5 jiao to 3.5 jiao. Later, due to market rumors, selling pressure surged, so the back row fell by 1 jiao to 4.5 jiao. In the next round, Class E fell by 5.5 jiao, which was unique, and the rest continued to fall by 1 jiao to 4 jiao. After the opening in the afternoon, selling pressure surged even more. Although No. 11 absorbed some, the supply still exceeded demand. Class E was sold by No. 47, a small amount of 4.5 jiao, and the rest was also generally sluggish. The closing was slightly covered by floating short positions, and mostly returned one or two jiao. If the environment does not change, the market price may be maintained for a while, otherwise a sharp drop is also expected. Yesterday's market price resulted in a small drop of two or three jiao to five or six jiao. The total number of transactions was 6.37 million yuan. Today and tomorrow, the exchange will handle the semi-annual settlement and will be closed for two days. The results of the rise and fall are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Because the standard yarn and cotton market was handling delivery procedures at the end of June, the market was closed for meetings. However, spot merchants still went to the market to do business.

The buying momentum was extremely strong, and the market price turned high. The market plate reached more than 211 yuan. By the time of the recent changes, the market conditions were becoming more and more difficult to grasp. After the Sino-US monetary agreement was announced, coupled with the rampant smuggling in North China, sellers became exceptionally active. The momentum was surging, and the market conditions slumped sharply. On May 11, the lowest price was 193.8 yuan. Following the unanimous rise in the world's cotton industry, short positions rose to cover, rising beyond the 200 yuan mark.

The delivered goods included 20 strands of Dafayong 450 bales, Shepherd Samsung 400 bales, and Kuixing 100 bales, totaling 950 bales, which were actually delivered.

Following the end of the year, the US cotton news turned bad, the far term broke the one jiao mark, and Indian cotton fine velvet fell sharply. Sellers took the opportunity to be active, and the market price stepped down to more than 41 yuan. However, the financial industry and gold merchants still held on tightly. At the same time, the vigorous spring sales of cotton yarn were stimulated, and it rose back to more than 6 yuan. Extending to the recent stillness, the US cotton, which was extremely quiet, moved forward step by step. The highest peak reached 46.4 yuan. Following the decline to 45.5 yuan at the close, it rose by 1.05 yuan compared to the listing price. As a result, the remaining 35,000 dan was reduced by 62,300 dan compared with the previous month. The delivery price was calculated based on the last three days as 46 yuan, up 3.5 yuan from the previous month. The delivery of coarse velvet cotton was reduced to only 6,000 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with many brokers closing out their long positions. Liverpool, Continental, and Southern commodity and credit companies announced they would continue selling cotton, leading to widespread selling. Prices for all months fell by 11 to 16 points. Dealers, spot traders, and local short sellers bought as prices fell. Later, buying interest weakened slightly, and dealers seemed to be waiting. Sentiment in the market was mixed. Some believed that even if prices eased, manufacturers, except for urgent needs, might not buy in large quantities. Furthermore, the Shanghai branch of American-East Asiatic Co. received a cable from New York stating that the public storage authorities had completely sold off July futures. Cotton market transactions were visibly broader, with demand for both old and new cotton. The base price of old cotton was considered firmer than before, and the price of new cotton performed well.

Spot prices fell 10 points, while futures fell 6 to 11 points. English cotton spot prices fell 8 points, and futures fell 6 to 8 points.

<p>Dried Locusts: Stocks of various grades are almost exhausted. Four boxes of new goods from Andong arrived yesterday, priced at 55 yuan. However, many locusts were headless and the color was dull, resulting in fewer buyers. New Yantai goods are currently selling for 32 to 33 yuan for small ones, and they remain popular.</p>

<p>Xiamen tangerine cakes had previously been sluggish due to poor sales in Shanghai, leading to repeated price declines. Therefore, it was difficult to match prices with Shanghai, and new arrivals had been scarce for a long time. However, sales to the north have gradually become active recently, and the market has seen a turnaround.

<p>— Wang Naigeng</p>
<p>Asia: The sugar production in Asian countries also shows a trend of decreasing year by year. Last year it was 3,190,000 tons. Compared with the previous year, Java, from 1894 (512,495 tons), last year (530,963 tons) was the first minimum production. One of its largest thousands had reached the limit of 3,100,000 tons. There was a large accumulation of sugar. It is necessary to reduce production. Last year, India was also affected by insufficient rainfall. However, the reduction in domestic consumption in recent years is the main reason. For the past four years, India's average annual production has been about 200,000 short of its consumption, so the reduction in demand directly affects the import of Java sugar. Japan and Taiwan were affected by typhoons, so the sugar production did not meet expectations. Although its production is slightly higher than consumption, sugar products are imported into China, so one side still needs to import raw materials from Java. China has suffered frequent floods in recent years, and the people are even poorer. Consumption of sugar foods has to be saved. The Philippines still increased in the previous year, but suddenly declined to 680,000 tons last year, a decrease of 713,000 tons compared to the previous year, more than doubled! The only reason is that the American Jones-Costigan Act limited it. Other countries have seen an increase. Here is a list of the amount of crystal sugar produced in Asian countries over the past three years. (Unit: thousand tons)</p>

<p>— Yale Chang, MD, B. Sc. (America)</p>
<p>But how do gonococci enter a healthy human body? The answer to this question is simple: they are transmitted through infection. Gonococci will never spontaneously generate in anyone's body. Gonorrhea is usually transmitted through unclean sexual intercourse. If a healthy man has sexual intercourse with a woman suffering from gonorrhea, the gonococci in the woman's vagina will enter the man's urethra during intercourse. Conversely, if a healthy woman has sexual intercourse with a man suffering from gonorrhea, the gonococci in the man's urethra will also enter the woman's vagina during intercourse. Therefore, unclean sexual intercourse is the best opportunity for the transmission of gonococci. More than 99 percent of gonorrhea cases are transmitted through unclean sexual intercourse.

<p>Gonorrhea treatment methods include flushing, injection, electrotherapy, and oral medication. Flushing involves inserting a tube, which is painful and carries the risk of sending the virus into internal tissues. Injection involves frequent needle punctures and carries the side effect of causing inflammation. Electrotherapy cannot stand alone and still requires the assistance of medication. Oral medication requires the selection of drugs, which patients are not familiar with, and unskilled doctors may harm people, and inferior drugs may harm people. The disease has not killed people, but people are harmed first. Based on my clinical experience, I know that the most effective treatment method in the past was injection with yellow pigment. However, yellow pigment injection has the drawbacks of pigment deposition and causing inflammation. Since the recent invention of the yellow pigment oral medication "Antirrhea," it has the advantage of overcoming the shortcomings. It has the same effect as yellow pigment injection but without its side effects. Therefore, in recent times, the European and American medical and pharmaceutical industries have regarded "Antirrhea" as the supreme authority in treating leucorrhea and gonorrhea. After returning to China, I have also repeatedly used it to cure acute and chronic gonorrhea patients, and the results are more satisfactory than any other medicine.</p>

<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Semen is the most essential substance in the human body. It is not only the basis of offspring but also nourishes the brain and health. Those who suffer from nocturnal emission have thin semen, and the brain cannot receive its nourishment. As a result, insomnia, forgetfulness, and other symptoms arise. The less sleep, the thinner the body becomes. Neurasthenia and other symptoms arise in droves.</p>
<p>The treatment for this condition, in addition to using proper astringent agents to reduce leakage, should also include taking large amounts of reproductive gland preparations to replenish the source. Treating both the symptoms and the root cause is the way to cure the disease.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Xing had suffered from nocturnal emission for many years. His semen was depleted, and his brain was weak. He was tired and difficult to support himself. This spring, I prescribed "Hemitol's Astringent Pills" to treat his nocturnal emission and "Reproductin" to replenish his semen and brain. After taking several boxes, the nocturnal emission stopped. His semen was sufficient, and his brain was healthy. He regained his health, which he had never had before.</p>

<p>— Physician Wu Dachao</p>
<p>This year, the weather is abnormal. The heat is more severe than usual. Epidemics are prevalent and are likely to be unavoidable. Sudden deaths will inevitably occur more often. Epidemic hospitals will have the difficulty of not being able to accommodate them. Since we cannot close our doors and isolate ourselves from society, external infections and internal causes are easy to contract. This is why it is important to pay attention to summer health preservation.</p>
<p>Infection with heatstroke is easier for the weak than for the strong. This is because the strength of resistance is very different. In addition to strictly implementing cleanliness and hygiene, we should often take the clear tonic "Reproductin" to increase resistance. Heatstroke will stay away. Even if infected, it will be mild and easier to treat. Those who pay attention to summer health preservation should pay attention to these three points!</p>

<p>This condition is generally caused by uterine inflammation. The treatment should focus on both internal and external methods. Internal medication should focus on female reproductive gland preparations that strengthen the uterus and remove inflammation. External use should focus on preparations made from lactic acid bacteria, vaginal bacilli, and liver starch.</p>
<p>(Letter from Mrs. Zheng of Xuzhou) Diseases are unavoidable for human beings. Medicines are indispensable for patients. However, it is inconvenient for us women to seek medical treatment for private illnesses, let alone take medicine. Like my relative, Mrs. Zai, who suffered from leucorrhea for many years. She concealed it and did not seek treatment, resulting in breast atrophy, body weakness, and menstrual disorders. Fortunately, after reading medical publications, I learned that I could take "Female Reproductin" internally and "Leukorrhea Relief" externally for treatment. I immediately purchased them from the nearby Wuzhou Pharmacy and used them internally and externally according to the instructions. The leucorrhea cleared first, and the menstruation was also regulated. The body quickly recovered its health, and the breasts regained their development. Family happiness also returned to the honeymoon period.</p>

<p>The human body is densely covered with glands. The nutrition of the whole body depends on them. Among the eight major glands, the reproductive gland is the most important. Those with weak reproductive glands not only suffer from sexually transmitted diseases but are also often sick and weak, aging prematurely. The treatment is best to administer reproductive gland extracts.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhou suffered from severe neurasthenia and sexually transmitted diseases due to masturbation and early marriage. He was not yet thirty but was already like someone in their forties. He came to see me last month. After I recommended him to purchase the reproductive gland extract preparation "Reproductin" from Wuzhou Pharmacy, his nerves recovered, and his sexually transmitted diseases were cured. He regained his youth and health.</p>

<p>Last winter, Mr. Zhang came to complain that he had suffered from nocturnal emission and was now suffering from weakness. His sexual function was declining, and his body and mind were weak. After I recommended him to purchase "Hemitol's Astringent Pills" from Taihe Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission and "Reproductin" to treat his weakness, the two conditions were eliminated after taking about half a dozen. His body and mind regained their health, as if he were a living dragon and tiger.</p>

<p>The symptoms of sexual neurasthenia vary, but nocturnal emission and premature emission are the most common. In one case, there is spontaneous emission without intercourse, and in the other case, there is ejaculation immediately after intercourse. Therefore, people often regard them as similar symptoms that can be treated with one medicine. In fact, this is a mistake. Here are the treatment methods.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Tang came this spring to complain that he suffered from both nocturnal emission and premature emission. Life force was lost. He had been married for a long time and was infertile. I prescribed "Hemitol's Astringent Pills" to treat his nocturnal emission and "Reproductin" to treat his premature emission. In less than a month, both conditions were suddenly cured, and life force was reborn.</p>

<p>Patient Mr. Luo, 27 years old, from Panyu, works in a certain agency. Mr. Luo was seduced by bad friends in his early years and mistakenly committed masturbation. He repeatedly devastated himself, causing great damage. He did not painfully quit until he was 22 years old. However, the reproductive glands had been destroyed, leading to nocturnal emission. At first, it was several times a month, then more than ten times a month. After the emission, he had headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, and dizziness. He had taken various tonics without any good results. This spring, because the nocturnal emission was even more severe, he came to me for treatment. I performed radio wave therapy and prescribed famous astringent pills. Before finishing two boxes, the nocturnal emission stopped. After taking several boxes, the nocturnal emission was eradicated. I also recommended taking reproductive gland extract preparations to replenish the loss. After taking about half a dozen, the old ailments disappeared, and the whole body became strong and healthy.</p>

He suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness, and repeatedly took tonics with little effect. The body gradually became thinner, and the mood was panicked, leading to symptoms of neurasthenia, night sweats, palpitations, back pain, dizziness, tinnitus. Last year, the nocturnal emission became more severe, and he suffered from premature ejaculation. This spring, introduced by Mr. Wei, he came to me for treatment. I observed that his reproductive glands were atrophied. It is not a long-term cure, it is recommended to take astringent pills to strengthen the sperm gates, and take reproductive gland extract preparations to treat the weakness. After taking it for less than a month, the nocturnal emission was eradicated, and the old ailments gradually disappeared. After taking it for two months, the muscles were plump, the qi and blood were strong, the weight increased, and the whole body was fully developed.</p>

In order to preserve his family fortune, he allowed his son to smoke to prevent him from spending money elsewhere. As the smoking addiction developed, the poisoning became deep, his body became weak, and he suffered from numerous illnesses. His respected father passed away the following year. Since then, the expenses for smoking and medication have been enormous, and his business ventures have repeatedly failed, causing more than half of the family assets to be lost. (Omitted) This spring, due to the government's strict orders to quit smoking, he became even more determined to quit. He was introduced for consultation by his close relatives. (Treatment) — Upon examination, I found that Mr. Wang was suffering from severe weakness, and it would be difficult to achieve complete success without a strengthening and quitting method. I immediately prescribed the famous safe smoking cessation medicine "Germinal Element" to restore strength and eliminate weakness, severing the addiction to residual toxins. At the same time, I injected him with "Nutrient-Bestowing Life-Preserver" to shorten the smoking cessation period to half a month. The smoking cessation was completely and successfully achieved, he reported.</p>

<p>Special Telegram Supplement</p>
<h3 id="e227">Please Governmental and Military Institutions Comply with the Executive Yuan's Order to Collect Cash for Official Telegrams <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Recently, the Executive Yuan stipulated three measures to rectify the fees for official military telegrams: 1. Starting from July 1, 1936, the "Regulations on Fees and Restrictions for Official Military Telegrams of the National Government" should be strictly enforced. 2. A circular order should be issued to all military and political institutions to restrict the sending of telegrams, and those who abuse telegrams under the guise of official institutions for personal gain should be severely punished. 3. If senders do not comply with the aforementioned regulations and forcibly demand that telegrams be sent, the relevant responsible authorities should severely punish them after investigation. The above measures have been circulated to all institutions for compliance and have been printed and posted. Will the collection of cash for official telegrams achieve its intended purpose from now on?</p>
<p>The expenses of the telegraph administration rely solely on telegram fees. In recent years, due to the suppression of bandits, many new telegraph lines have been established, resulting in large and insufficient expenditures. In addition, the arrears of official military telegrams are very heavy. From the establishment of the capital by the National Government in 1928 to the end of 1935, the accumulated arrears have reached more than 37 million yuan! If this continues, not only will public communications be unable to be maintained, but also military communications will be difficult to sustain. According to regulations, official military telegrams should be forwarded as a priority, and unless otherwise specified, the price should be half the ordinary rate for both clear and coded text telegrams. For military telegrams in combat or bandit suppression areas, the material fee is five jiao per hundred characters, and if the number of characters is less than one hundred, it should be counted as one hundred characters. These were stipulated in Articles 3 and 19 of the "Regulations on Fees and Restrictions for Official Military Telegrams" promulgated by the National Government in July 1934, and should be followed accordingly. However, due to frequent military operations and exhausted military funds, and with the arrears of official telegrams becoming a habit, while many political and military institutions pay for official military telegrams according to regulations, there are also many who repeatedly delay payment. Now, under the leadership of the supreme leader Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the entire country's military and political affairs are increasing administrative efficiency and developing transportation functions as its policy guidelines, which is more powerful and has more achievements than any previous era. Therefore, it is certain that rectifying the fees for official military telegrams can be easily implemented effectively. The above measures are truly beneficial to the future of the telegraph industry.</p>
<p>Collecting cash for official telegrams is not only beneficial to the telegraph industry but also provides many conveniences for military and political institutions. Here are some further explanations:</p>
<p>Advancing Communication Speed: The value of telegrams lies in speed. Official military telegrams particularly value speed. However, the capacity of telegraph machines is limited, and the condition of the lines varies. Therefore, telegrams should be as brief as possible, and non-urgent matters should not be sent by telegram. Unnecessary words should not be included in the telegram text. In other words, sending fewer non-urgent telegrams will prevent the congestion of lines for urgent telegrams, and using fewer unnecessary words will speed up the transmission of necessary words. Recognizing this, Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued an order in December 1932 to the political and military institutions and bandit suppression troops in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui to strictly limit the sending of telegrams. "In the future, regardless of which institution sends a telegram, the text must be concise and clear. Unless it is absolutely necessary, it should not exceed one hundred characters. Non-urgent matters should not be marked with 'Urgent' unnecessarily. For non-emergency situations, express mail should be used instead of sending telegrams at every turn." Sending too many telegrams not only congests the lines but also delays important telegrams. It is hoped that political and military leaders will strictly comply with this order to avoid delaying matters.</p>
<p>Reducing Telegram Budget: Political and military institutions often overspend on telegrams due to the abuse of sending telegrams. As a result, the budget for telegrams is often too large and cannot be fully claimed. If the above measures are followed and strictly enforced for telegrams sent, telegram fees will be reduced. Moreover, if each telegram sent must be paid in cash according to regulations, the monthly telegram expenses can be clearly settled. In the future, it will not be difficult to determine the telegram budget, and it will not be difficult to audit the final accounts. Since the Executive Yuan has issued an order to pay for official military telegrams in cash, the political and military institutions can submit monthly requests for the telegram expenses they have incurred, and there will be no risk of arrears.</p>
<p>The greatest efficiency of a political organization lies in flexible operation, especially in orderly systems and effective implementation of orders. Now that President Chiang has the greatest determination to rectify the fees for official telegrams, it is hoped that all political and military institutions will strictly comply with President Chiang's intentions and strive to implement them to achieve effectiveness. Increasing administrative efficiency is indeed the goal, not only for the sake of the telegraph industry's future.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Discussing Ship Radio Telegrams <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Telegrams transmitted between ship radio stations and coastal radio stations or other ship radio stations are called ship radio telegrams. Any ship that has been registered with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and issued a ship radio station license may install its own radio telegraph equipment and communicate directly with the coastal radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. Telegrams exchanged between the above-mentioned ship radio stations and various locations within the country are called domestic ship telegrams. Ship telegrams that do not comply with the above regulations are considered international ship telegrams. Domestic ship telegrams are charged in national currency, and the fee per word is composed of three items: domestic fee, coastal radio station fee, and ship radio station fee. For example, according to the current domestic ship radio station rate table, the domestic fee and coastal radio station fee for ordinary or political rotary telegrams in Chinese clear language between ships and various locations within the country are both one jiao per word, and the ship radio station fee is five fen. Therefore, the total price per word is two jiao five fen. The total price per word for urgent telegrams in Chinese clear language is three jiao five fen. (Because the domestic fee for urgent telegrams is charged at twice the domestic fee for ordinary telegrams, the domestic fee for urgent telegrams in Chinese clear language should be two jiao per word, plus the coastal radio station fee of one jiao and the ship radio station fee of five fen, totaling three jiao five fen.) International ship telegrams are charged in gold francs, but within the national border, they may be charged in national currency according to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' exchange rate between gold francs and national currency. The total price per word is composed of four items: ship radio station fee, coastal radio station fee, domestic telegraph line fee, and international telegraph line fee. For example, for telegrams between ships and Hong Kong, transmitted through the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' coastal radio station, domestic landline or radio, and the international radio circuit directly to Hong Kong, the total price per word should be 1.90 gold francs (but if the ship sends a telegram to Hong Kong from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' coastal radio stations in Shanghai or Fuzhou, the price is only 1.40 gold francs per word, because this telegram does not pass through domestic lines, so the domestic telegraph line fee of 0.50 gold francs is deducted). Within the national border, the above-mentioned gold franc telegram rates are converted into national currency at the current exchange rate of 1.14 yuan per gold franc and 1.60 yuan per 1.40 gold francs.</p>
<p>According to Article 3 of the current "Ship Radio Telegram Fee Regulations," any ship that has not been registered with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and issued a ship radio station license, if it communicates with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' coastal radio stations, all exchanged telegrams should be charged as international ship telegrams. For example, suppose there are two ships equipped with ship radio stations, both sending Chinese clear language ship telegrams from Guangzhou to Nanjing at the same time. If one ship has not been registered with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and issued a ship radio station license, the ship telegrams sent by that ship should be charged as international ship telegrams according to regulations, and the fee should be 1.40 gold francs per word, equivalent to 1.60 yuan in national currency. If the ship has been registered with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and issued a license, the fee will be charged according to the domestic ship telegram rate, which is only 0.25 yuan per word, a significant difference. Therefore, all state-owned or foreign shipping companies can first apply to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for registration of their ships, apply for a ship's nationality certificate, and then apply to the Radio Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to fill out and issue a ship radio station license before requesting the application of domestic ship telegram rates. After completing the above procedures, they can save a considerable amount of telegram fees each year. Therefore, all shipping companies should handle ship registration and ship radio station license application matters in accordance with regulations, without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the "Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations," the "Ship Radio Telegram Fee Regulations" have not been changed. The recipient's name, title, ship name, coastal radio station name, or address for all domestic Chinese ship telegrams should be charged per word and are not subject to the charging method for the recipient's address and name specified in the "Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations." For example, in the telegram "{Commissioner Liu (36) Official Cabin Xin Ming Yantai}," the recipient's name, title, ship name, and coastal radio station name should be charged as thirteen words. For the recipient's ship radio station name in international ship telegrams, according to Articles 19, Sections 1 and 2 of the "International Telegraph Regulations," it should be allowed to be written together. For example, in the telegram "{Captain Watson, Chinaexportetxnhs}," Chinaexporterxnhs is the English ship name and ship radio station call sign of the Huada Ship. This recipient's ship radio station name can be counted as one word, regardless of the number of letters. However, if the ship name is written together in the text and it is proven to be the ship name without error, the maximum number of letters per word in foreign language ship telegrams is fifteen, and one word will be added for each additional letter. If the text is in code, the maximum number of letters per word is five. Except for international coded ship telegrams, which are allowed to be charged at 60% of the coded rate, domestic foreign language coded telegrams are charged at the full price and are not discounted. For example, "President Jackson" should be counted as two words in a foreign language telegram and four words in a coded telegram. Senders of ship telegrams should pay close attention to the above charging methods to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

Nanchang and Huaining are important political and military strongholds. Therefore, the Beijing-Hankou trunk line is the most important project in the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone Project. After more than a year of effort, the project has been completed. The central station's power-assisted equipment is still being installed, and direct calls between Beijing and Hankou will soon be possible. The west section between Hankou, Nanchang, and Jiujiang, as well as the east section between Nanchang, Jiujiang, Huaining, Wuhu, and Nanjing, have all been opened for calls.

<p>Hurricane Telegrams</p>
<p>During the hurricane season, coastal ship radio stations may have difficulty receiving hurricane warnings broadcast by the Central Meteorological Research Institute due to the distance. In order to ensure navigation safety, the Radio Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has requested the Central Meteorological Research Institute that, from June 1 to the end of October, when a hurricane warning is issued, in addition to broadcasting as usual, the warning should also be sent by telegram to the coastal radio stations in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Yantai, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Each of these stations will then follow the regulations for automatic warning signals in Section R of Article 22 of the International Radiotelegraph Convention, first sending twelve long dashes, and after a two-minute interval, sending the hurricane warning, in order to prepare for precautions. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Maritime Administration has also instructed the relevant maritime affairs bureaus to instruct the relevant ship radio stations to pay attention to receiving these warnings.</p>
<p>Flood Control Telegrams</p>
<p>Every summer in China, river levels rise greatly. If telegrams are not used to transmit information for prevention, there will inevitably be breaches extending for miles, resulting in vast floods. In order to support flood control efforts, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has established a type of telegram called "Flood Control Telegrams." It is stipulated that from June 1 to the end of August, flood control telegrams sent by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and its affiliated works offices, dike construction bureaus, flow measurement stations, and engineering offices, using the bureau's printed telegram paper, and telegrams sent by the bureau to the Southern Lian, National Economic Committee, Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, and the governments of all counties in Hubei Province with embankments, reporting on flood control, will be transmitted free of charge, but must be in clear language. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has instructed the bureaus along the Yangtze River in Hubei Province to comply with this.</p>

<p>Mr. Sun Keming of the Yantai Telegraph Bureau, drawing on his lifelong knowledge and experience, and referring to various Western books, has compiled a book titled "Solutions to Examination Questions for Wireless Telegraph Operators," totaling more than 200,000 words. The main text is divided into twelve chapters, with more than 540 questions and more than 100 illustrations. All wireless telegraph questions are covered, such as general theory, transmitter theory, application receivers, radio direction finding, storage batteries, motor generators, rectifiers, antennas, frequency measurement, convention regulations, shortwave broadcasting, wireless telephony, and aviation wireless, all are covered comprehensively. The book is currently being sold exclusively by the Zhongyong Wireless Electric Machinery Factory at 77 Lloyd Road, Shanghai. It will be published in mid-August. Those who pre-order before the end of July will receive a 50% discount, costing only one yuan (plus 0.13 yuan for registered postage).</p>

<p>This publication has specially established a question and answer column. Members of the public who have unclear points regarding the procedures for sending and receiving telegrams and telephone calls, or regarding the telegraph regulations, or who have inquiries about general telegraph knowledge, are welcome to submit their questions, and this publication will provide answers.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Kezhi of Nanjing asks: What are half-price official telegrams? Full-price official telegrams? And bandit suppression military telegrams? Please provide detailed explanations.</p>
<p>(Answer) According to Article 8 of the "Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations," the following institutions' telegrams sent on official business are classified as official military telegrams and are charged at half the ordinary rate: 1. The Executive Committee, Supervisory Committee, and Central Political Conference of the Central Party Headquarters, and their directly affiliated associations and offices. 2. The National Government and its directly affiliated Yuan, Ministries, Committees, and Offices. 3. The Ministries and Committees directly under the Five Yuan. 4. Provincial Party Headquarters and municipal Party Headquarters directly under the Central Party Headquarters. 5. Provincial governments and municipal or local institutions directly under the Executive Yuan. 6. Military officers with the rank of division commander or independent brigade commander and above. 7. Commanders of naval fleets or important ports. 8. Air Force commanders. 9. Commissioners, representatives, or staff members dispatched by the above institutions (limited to those who send telegrams using the institution's printed telegram paper with the advance signature and seal of the responsible head of the institution). 10. Special Party Headquarters directly under the Central Party Headquarters (limited to important telegrams sent to the Central Party Headquarters using the Central Party Headquarters' printed telegram paper). 11. County and city Party Headquarters or district Party Headquarters directly under provincial Party Headquarters (limited to important telegrams sent to the Central Party Headquarters or the respective provincial Party Headquarters using the provincial Party Headquarters' printed telegram paper).</p>
<p>Full-price official telegrams refer to telegrams sent by responsible heads of other political and military institutions reporting on military affairs, disasters, or urgent matters related to local security. These telegrams are charged at the ordinary telegram rate (Chinese coded and clear language are priced the same) but are still transmitted in the order of official military telegrams.</p>
<p>Bandit suppression military telegrams refer to military telegrams sent by military institutions in combat or bandit suppression areas. A material fee of five jiao per hundred words is charged first (if the number of words is less than one hundred, it is counted as one hundred words), and the remaining unpaid fees are treated as arrears. The telegraph bureau fills out a form each month and sends it to the sending institution to be stamped, and then submits it to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Prospects for the First Volume of "New Youth" <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jian San</p>
<p>Receiving the latest issue of "New Youth" and seeing the index of the entire volume attached at the end, I realize that "New Youth" has been published for half a year now. Time flies so quickly!</p>
<p>Having read "New Youth" for half a year, as this first volume comes to an end and the second volume is about to begin, I would like to say a few words about this past volume, not as criticism, but merely as my impressions after reading it.</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, there are many magazines now, but if you want to find one that is suitable for students in upper elementary school and junior high school to read, it seems that there is none other than "New Youth." Although it can be said that this is because of my limited knowledge, it is undeniable that there are not many publications that are tailored to that level.</p>
<p>I believe that magazines are different from textbooks. The material in textbooks is dead, without temporal relevance, while magazines are different. They must publish the latest material to make sense. The magazines that ordinary students read now, apart from carrying some animals and plants that are appropriate for the season, do not care about anything else. "New Youth" is different. In addition to articles on animals and plants suitable for the season, such as "Adventure in the Stratosphere," "The French Maginot Line," "The World's Largest Ocean Liner: The Queen Mary," "The Aerial Palace: The Hindenburg," "The Total Solar Eclipse on June 19," etc., are all "new" and "youthful" materials with temporal relevance. Articles about animals and plants suitable for the season can be used this year or in future years, but topics like the ones mentioned above in "New Youth" would lose their timeliness if they were published next year or in the second half of the year. Therefore, the editors of "New Youth" have been able to pay attention to this word "new," which is something that other magazines have not done. Other materials are also not like other publications that indiscriminately select anything, as if "anything put in the basket is a vegetable." For example, on the two hundredth anniversary of Watt's birth, they talked about Watt; when Pavlov passed away, they introduced Pavlov's theories; when the Soviet Union was engaged in the "Stakhanov Movement," they introduced Stakhanov's history; on the fiftieth anniversary of the invention of aluminum, they talked about aluminum. This is not like the editors of other publications who talk about Watt when they have materials about Watt today, and publish the biography of Einstein tomorrow, as if it were a textbook where the materials in the third lesson can be moved to the fifth or tenth lesson without any problem. This is another area where "New Youth" magazine is superior to other magazines.</p>
<p>Usually, I hear a lot of criticism about magazines from friends. Many people recognize that since the publication of "New Youth," it has had a significant impact on other reading materials for young people. Therefore, some magazines not only imitate "New Youth" in many aspects of layout but also imitate it in many aspects of content. For example, the exhibition of Mr. Sheng Tao's articles is now included in several reading materials for young people; Mr. Yi Wen's "Youth Reading Room" is now also included in many reading materials for young people. However, this is superficial imitation, and the content is not as carefully selected as in "New Youth."</p>
<p>Regarding literary materials, other magazines mostly publish materials about cat brothers and dog brothers. This kind of material only caters to the low-level interests of children and is actually meaningless. "New Youth" magazine does not have this kind of material. Although it also publishes Mr. Sheng Tao's "Bird and Animal Language," the bird and animal language is definitely not as boring as cat brothers and dog brothers, so we cannot compare them. As for Mr. Sheng Tao's "Neighbors," which points out the impropriety of people's blind xenophobia, and Mr. Mao Dun's "Young Printing Worker," which points out the normal concept of young people towards occupations, these are things that cannot be seen in other publications.</p>
<p>China is a scientifically backward country, so magazines for ordinary students only publish game materials for science. "New Youth" is not like this. Science games and science interests are only used as filler materials, such as "Interesting Stories about Animals" in the eighth issue and "Aquatic Competition of Magnetic Needles" in the ninth issue, which are only filler. As for others, there are always two or three science articles in each issue, either in biology or in physics and chemistry, which not only provide theoretical explanations but also provide experimental methods. I think that if many other magazines also put in as much effort as "New Youth" in science, then although China's science is backward, students would not feel a headache when they see science subjects.</p>
<p>This volume of "New Youth," although only twelve thin issues, has very rich material, and the printing is very economical, with no wasted space. Moreover, except for the first issue, most of them are printed in size five font. As for "New Youth Lecture," it was printed in size six font later on. In this way, the space saved allows for the publication of one or two more articles, which is very suitable for readers. If we talk about the number of pages, perhaps other children's publications have more, but in terms of the number of words, "New Youth" has one or two times more than other children's publications.</p>
<p>I am not just flattering "New Youth." "New Youth" magazine naturally has its shortcomings. For example, some of the articles are relatively lacking in content. "The Hongkou Vegetable Market in Shanghai" does not describe the management of the vegetable market, nor does it bring out the suffering of vegetable vendors who are oppressed. I think the article only did the surface and did not write into the heart. "The Temple Fair at Jing'an Temple in Shanghai" does not have much social background. "About the China Traveling Theater Troupe" is mostly empty talk and somewhat like an advertisement for the traveling theater troupe. These cannot be considered minor flaws. However, it is not easy to compile a magazine, and it is not easy to demand that it be completely flawless. It seems a bit immoral for me to say a few sarcastic remarks on the sidelines. However, from the reader's point of view, we may as well demand more from it, although we know that the advantages of "New Youth" magazine outweigh these minor flaws.</p>
<p>Because "New Youth" is now the authority on all youth publications in China, I would like to say a few words about what I hope for in the second volume, in addition to briefly mentioning the content of the first volume above.</p>
<p>Of course, I hope that the second volume will maintain the above-mentioned advantages and eliminate the above-mentioned minor flaws. In terms of content, I hope to add more materials. For example, Mr. Zi Kai's "Art Stories" talks about painting. It would be best to also talk about music. Also, the turbulent international situation, such as "Abyssinia" and "Hitler's Elixir of Life," it would be best to have one or two articles of this kind in each issue. As for the publication aspect, it would be better if it could be published earlier. Because after we readers finish reading a new issue of the magazine, we immediately look forward to the early publication of the next issue. I think that many people may share this hope with me!</p>
<p>After reading the editor's postscript of the twelve issues of "New Youth," I know that the editors are also working hard to reform the second volume. Ah, well, I don't need to say anything more. I hope "New Youth" will always be the leader of general youth publications!</p>
<h3 id="e234">Why Write "The Resurrection of Philosophy"? <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Zhu'yu</p>
<p>"The Resurrection of Philosophy" Published by Kaiming Bookstore, Actual Price 35 cents</p>
<p>If anyone were to be seen reading a philosophy book, people would invariably say, "Oh my, I never knew you were turning into a philosopher!" This is a very common and real occurrence that I frequently encounter. We can glean two layers of meaning from this statement.</p>
<p>First, philosophy has always been regarded as something sacred and unapproachable, said to be full of solemn language and incomprehensible theories. Reading it is like touching a hedgehog, with no good outcome. Therefore, those who study philosophy are seen as deities with three heads and six arms, possessing superhuman powers; or as old scholars with thick beards and wearing old-fashioned glasses, whose every sentence takes half an hour to understand. Of course, the person saying the former sentence is implicitly being sarcastic, mocking you for putting on airs, implying that becoming a philosopher is an impossible feat.</p>
<p>Second, in today's 20th century, science is particularly developed, as if everyone must become a scientist before they are satisfied. What is the point of philosophy? What is its use? It is always filled with insignificant phrases, and its meaning is shrouded in clouds, ambiguous and vague, impossible to grasp. Therefore, you see philosophy as fundamentally outdated, and you face the same bitter experience as a science student receiving a scornful look from a liberal arts student.</p>
<p>This is a correct assessment. Philosophy has always seemed very profound; you can pick up any philosophy book at random, and its thickness alone proves it. The depth of the language is also undeniable. Anyone who has translated philosophy books knows the difficulty, as terms like "intellect," "reason," "conscience," "idea," "reality," "concept," "image," "consciousness," "will"... are constantly used in different contexts, causing dizziness and mental fatigue after reading too much. As for the claim that philosophy is outdated, that is indeed true: scientific principles like gravity can be applied to inclined planes, but what use are philosophical concepts? Philosophy seems utterly useless. However, philosophy is necessary, and we should all read a few philosophy books. Philosophy is not difficult; when we read it, we experience a lingering aftertaste like eating olives, and it is easily broken down with just one bite. I firmly believe in this, which motivated me to write "The Resurrection of Philosophy" to prove that my words are not false. I have the following objectives:</p>
<p>1 The "Kaiming Youth Series" has everything else but lacks a philosophical work, making it incomplete. Therefore, I wrote "The Resurrection of Philosophy" to fill this gap, giving young people or any reader the opportunity to sample philosophy. A "general introduction" is most suitable for those who are new to or unclear about the subject, and "The Resurrection of Philosophy" has the nature of a "general introduction": it includes all the important philosophical questions, and each question provides ample hints and guidelines, so that future research can have a clear framework to grasp. However, this book differs from other ABCs or general introductions: (1) Although this book is a general introduction, after the general introduction, it offers fair criticism, so that the reader will not feel confused, and finally presents the author's views, which are supportive and do not interfere with other schools of thought, like icing on the cake. The reader can choose whatever they like: this style is probably not found in other books. (2) This book differs from other books in that it also contains historical records of philosophy. The history of philosophy is very important because it shows the formation process of each school of thought, tracing its origins and foundations, vividly presented. This is often overlooked in introductory books. Therefore, this book can be read as a general introduction to philosophy and as a history of philosophy, both of which provide a deeper understanding. It is very suitable as a textbook for high school philosophy electives. (3) This book has a precise dissection and narrative of Chinese philosophy. Ordinary philosophy books mostly focus on Western philosophy, and Chinese philosophy is not understood, which is a very tragic phenomenon. After reading this book and understanding Western philosophy, there is also a broad path to understanding Chinese philosophy. It is very suitable as a textbook and necessary for ordinary reading.</p>
<p>2 The content of philosophy is made very easy in this book because the main argument of this book is, "There is no philosophy, only the philosophy of life." Philosophy becomes profound because it focuses solely on cosmology and epistemology. This book argues that it is better to abandon cosmology and epistemology and focus on the philosophy of life. The philosophy of life is something everyone experiences, its meaning is simple, and everyone needs to understand it. If that is the case, wouldn't philosophy make people happy again, wouldn't it be "resurrected"? Even though that is said, this book still gives cosmology and epistemology a good position, offering thorough arguments, so that readers still have the necessary inherent knowledge.</p>
<p>3 The language used in this book strives to be concise, so that a thin book can include all the problems, but without making it "outline-like". Understanding is very easy, and there is no cumbersome and unclear language found in other philosophy books. After reading it, you can overcome the feeling that reading philosophy is a long journey. In addition, thoughtful examples are often cited to strengthen the impression, but without confusing the examples with the original meaning, so as to not lose the true meaning, like in some popular philosophy books where the examples overshadow the main point.</p>
<p>4 Philosophy and science have many interconnected relationships. People who study science should read philosophy, just as astronomy is a transformation of metaphysics and chemistry solves the organization of life, which all needs to be known. Therefore, this book mixes science and philosophy, so that those who study science and philosophy can have an academic connection, and so that those who study philosophy can know the true meaning of science. This is indeed a good method of learning, and should not be one-sided, but should be combined. Reading this book will naturally allow you to grasp the general situation of all knowledge and its relationships. Moreover, you will never see philosophy as a useless thing; on the contrary, it has the ability to help various sciences.</p>
<p>Finally, before the publication of this book, it was carefully proofread, and no misprints will occur. Also, the price is very low (only 35 cents, with a 30% discount during the special price period), making it affordable to buy. These are all things that the author is very happy about.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Education issued instructions on the sale of textbooks and other books, the Shanghai Booksellers Association has held several meetings and decided to implement it from today. In addition to reducing the price of textbooks for sale, Kaiming Bookstore will also reduce the price of popular books to attract more widespread purchases, which is also good news for the reading community.</p>

<h3 id="e236">The Way Out for the Weak <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>Poverty and illness are the common fate of every worker in capitalist society.</p>
<p>In this common fate, there are only two paths in front of them: the strong take risks, while the weak are bound by invisible chains, forever suffering torment; or, unable to bear the long-term torment, they can only use their own hands to end their lives. And those who suffer torment, in the end, because they cannot bear the torment, also have only one path: death.</p>
<p>Or, they deliberately commit some "crime" and get locked up in prison, without having to bother to get an unimaginable amount of food, clothing and shelter. But what is the result? Relentless years flow by like water, and the black hair on their heads turns white, and the result is also death. Although they extend this thing called "life" a little longer than those who commit suicide, they are also causing their flesh to suffer more pain.</p>
<p>If a suffering and starving person is willing to endure that suffering, forever begging for a living in the mud, and has no lofty ideal in front of him, then I think it is better for him to die. To be at the mercy of others, whipped and abused, living like a pig in a stinking mud pit, can this really be considered "life"?</p>
<p>Although people cannot live entirely on "ideals," they cannot live without "ideals." If the thing thought of is never possible to realize, then it is a "fantasy," not an "ideal." The ideal is based on reality.</p>
<p>However, what the weak who are suffering from hunger and cold seem to universally lack is this, or, although they have "ideals," they build their "ideals" on others. They still long for life to "become" better than it is now, but they dare not fight against "life." (Think about it! Who made their "life" the way it is now?) They want others to improve their lives, and then they can enjoy it.</p>
<p>(There is naturally no such thing in the world.)</p>
<p>Let's take an example: a sixteen-year-old apprentice in a steel factory committed suicide. In his suicide note to his elder brother, he wrote, "Now, among the four of us, I rely entirely on my brother to make a name for himself, to avenge our parents, I hope you will not be sad.</p>
<p>He built the hope of "revenge" on his older brother, but he cowardly committed suicide, and even told his older brother not to be sad. Like the behavior of every "weak" person.</p>
<p>In this way, other than "death," the "weak" will never find their way out. Because they dare not fight hard against "life," and "life" will not let them go one step.</p>
<p>Where is the way out for the weak? I want to loudly ask the people who dare not fight with "life." Is "death" really the only way out for you?</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Story of Pigeons <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>(I want to write down some interesting stories about pigeons when I am lonely.)</p>
<p>When I was a child, my blind second uncle was my interesting companion. In the evening, I would put a few bamboo chairs with my eldest sister and brothers in the garden, and everyone would sit in pairs, playing clapping games or counting the stars in the sky. Because I was the youngest of them, they often ganged up to make fun of me, so I would play by myself. Thus, I could only talk to the lonely, blind second uncle, listening to him tell interesting stories about fireflies and rabbits, which often made me forget about them – my eldest sister and brothers – and yearn for the interesting things in the stories.</p>
<p>My blind second uncle once told me interesting stories about pigeons, and in my heart, I was full of excitement and yearning. Those interesting stories were painted red and blue. My blind second uncle was narrating his experiences raising pigeons. I often remember him constantly smiling, his eyes narrowed into a slit due to his chronic eye problem, and his lower jaw trembling as he spoke:</p>
<p>"Raising pigeons is so interesting. Even if they are hundreds of miles away, they still recognize their old home (Note)."</p>
<p>(But stories are just stories. When I was a child, I didn't understand anything, so I was easy to listen to and easy to forget. So after a few days, the yearning and excitement were gone. From my blind second uncle, I also heard about fish and cuckoos… many interesting stories.)</p>
<p>One morning, I heard a small, tinkling sound like jade leaves falling in the distance. I looked up and saw a dozen snow-white pigeons flying back and forth in the clear sky. Their silver wings glittered beautifully in the sunlight.</p>
<p>According to my blind second uncle, those were pigeons, and the small bells were clipped in the middle of their tails. When the wind blew, they would ring. So I remembered the beautiful stories about pigeons that my blind second uncle told me, and it made me think about raising pigeons myself.</p>
<p>Raising pigeons was unfamiliar to me, as I was still very young. But my blind second uncle readily agreed to handle everything. He built a house for the pigeons in the garden, and it only took him one day. It was something to see.</p>
<p>Finally, at Grandpa You Shun's house, I asked for a pair of young pigeons (that's what my blind second uncle told me to do. He said, "Adult pigeons will go back even after three or four years of raising, while young pigeons are like children and don't understand anything, so they are easy to raise.") I locked them in the newly built pigeon house, and I didn't care about anything else, "because I didn't know how to arrange things." I let my blind second uncle take care of the care and management alone. The next morning, I went to the garden with my eldest sister and brothers, and we could already see my blind second uncle busy adding food and water. Pigeons only eat some corn, wheat, green beans, and grains and other agricultural products, which we already had, so we didn't have to go to the street to buy them. We ran close to my blind second uncle, and while adding food, my blind second uncle said to us, "Wait for them to..."</p>
