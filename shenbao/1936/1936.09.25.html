<h3 id="c8">英國在地中海上的新攻勢 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 期</p>
<p>這幾天國際政治的重心。已移轉到萊芒湖畔的和平殿堂。阿比西尼亞出席國聯代表的資格問題。正是國際視綫集中的焦點。可是我們不要忘記。阿比西尼亞之被意大利吞併。不但使國聯遭遇到空前未有的打擊。而且還使地中海上英意勢力的衝突。更形尖銳。這種尖銳的衝突。並沒有因為對意制裁的取消而緩和下來。相反的。最近英意兩國在地中海上的鬥爭。是以更高的速度進行着。允以最近英國的反攻形勢最為明顯。</p>
<p>不列顚帝國之所以要在地中海上對意大利採取反攻的形。勢一方面固然是由於意大利的呑併阿比西尼亞。使英國在地中海東部的地位大為削弱。而另一方而却也因為西班牙叛軍聲勢的浩大。使英國在地中海西部的地位。尤其為西方門戶之直布羅陀的安全。大受威脅。西班牙叛軍之受意德二大法西斯國家的實力援助。早已成為公開的秘密。要是叛軍能够攫取瑪德里的政權。那末西屬摩洛哥與巴育利羣島。都將成為意大利的屬地。這樣一來。向為不列顚帝國之生命綫的海上通路。就時刻有受意大利截斷的危險。所以在黑衫首相這樣嚴重的壓迫下。英國是不得不採取反攻的新陣勢了。</p>
<p>關於英國在地中每上反攻意大利的新陣勢。我們可以舉出幾伴最近的重要事實來做引證。第一是上月二十六日英埃聯盟條約的簽訂。這個條約的主旨。一万面是在表面上允許埃及的完全獨立。藉以緩和埃及的反英運動。而同時却也就是要在戰爭爆發或威脅時。可使埃及聽受英國的指揮。聯合進攻他們共同的敵人。第二是最近英皇愛德華八世的巡遊地中海。並歷訪巴爾幹請國的元首。英皇此行之含有重大的政治意義。是不言可喩的。羅馬史丹巴報已於十九日的評論中指出。「英皇在南斯拉夫時。曾就達爾瑪夏地方（在亞德里海東岸）切實加以考察。藉以明悉該慮海岸。原可作為海軍艦隊之陷阱者。可否改為進攻意國之根據地。其在希臘。則欲引誘該國獨裁考。遵守舊日傅統政策。而聽任英國海軍為所欲為。共在十耳其斯丹埠。則其政治作用。允為彰明顯著。綠英國原有之威信。自意阿戰爭後。業已大見低落。自不能不努力恢復之。」意報這種評論。雖不免含有主觀的色彩。但現在事實業已證明。英土二國將於下月在倫敦舉行會議。簽訂地中海恊定以。抵制意大利勢力的東侵了。再决。是英國海軍大臣霍爾爵士之巡弋地中海一帶。視察各海軍根據地與艦隊。並於二十二日回抵倫敦後。發表官言。說一英國不但毫無放棄其在地中海所處地位之意。並擬對於新近發生之種種困難問題。設法加以應。付史使英國日後之地位。益臻安全。」這不是反攻意國壓迫之最明白的自供嗎。</p>
<p>此外如英國航空决長沙遜爵士之飛往埃及。蘇丹視察皇家空軍根據地。英艦一部份之巡弋地中海東部。以及派遣大批軍隊前往巴勒斯坦。彈壓阿人的反英運動。都可說是英國反攻意國勢力壓迫的新陣勢。我們觀此情形。萊芒湖畔的和平外交戰。固然應當注意。而英意兩國在地中海上之新鬥爭的形勢。也是不能忽視的。</p>

<p>— 徐舒</p>
<p>三十日早晨八點鐘到香港，香港去過的人快遠別了要去辭別，沒有去過目然要去拜訪，二天二夜航行該兒見陸地，二天二夜的外國餐該換換日味，所以幾乎是全數上岸了。</p>
<p>我們寄出了信買點東西，於是想僱汽車到全香港走走，我們一組一共六個人，在中國旅行社僱車，那裏　得來車是私人照會車，被　個中國警察所攔，一同康到警察所謂「我們政府」的巡捕房去。警察說話非常戚風，但到了「我們政府」裏，他也就毫無威權，翻譯員告訴我們私人照會禁做生意，目的在免車夫私自賺錢，而這車旣是八國飯店（車夫說是六國飯店的）而車中也在這裏（車主是聞訊跟來的），所以與普通情形不同了，看來那巡捕不見得能够討好，我以我們時間有限吿訴他，請他帮忙，讓我們先法，他同一個肥胖的酒後的外國人說了，那外國人就呼我們出來，出來時那個巡捕，也要跟出來，也許算是照呼或者是送行吧，可是被那外國人斥往，而且訓斥他為什麽把我們帶去。我當時很想聽下法，可是他們好像是不許我們冉躭的，所以就出來了。</p>
<p>坐汽車在香港兜圈原是走馬看花，記載香港的文章也到處都有，我沒有什麽話可以說，這塊中國所有的英國管理了九十多年的殖民地，顯然是分為二層。管理者與工作者，英國人與中國人，在中國治下是個荒山，小小　漁港而已。現在是早已有高大的洋房，　鬧的市街，寬闊的盤旋的柏油馬路，電車汽車都可直上山頂了，其他大學中學醫院不用說，在這小小的地方能够經營得這樣好，英國入的能力是可佩服的。可是中國難道不能嗎？中國的工程師會製這　的洋房馬路的不知有多少，中國的醫生會管理創辦這樣的醫院的也不知道多少，中國也不見得沒有綫來經營這些。但是中國從不會想到一個孤單的荒島可以去經營成一各商港，從不會想到科學也可以在荒僻的地方創立一個王國。下野的軍閥官僚，有多少是　着幾千萬財產在現成的香港享樂的，可有人想到另外的地方去經營一個另外的香港，看到香港以後，我更感到中國民族只求適應環境，不敢反抗環境是一個致命的傷勢。一切政治外交……，都求適應舊環境，不敢打出新局面釣我想都是同一的民族的劣性吧！</p>
<p>船停在　龍，來去香港是用小輸渡的；九龍　有許多漁家，在夜間海灣水漲的時候，聯羣結隊到灣心點起燈來捕魚、捕魚的方法家家</p>
<p>樣，以舢　點燈，駐紥為總部，以小蓬艇撤網，包圍好了，艇首再以套有木塊的竹竿激水，發聲如敲鼓一樣，使魚羣因此恐嚇而竄到網裏去。</p>
<p>捕魚之外，他們也常常涉足右嚴縫中，掰着火技去探尋，我悄悄的在灣崖石脚之處管理棚兩，在捕明蝦龍蝦花蠶石班，黃脚蠟……一些東西。</p>
<p>這些艱苦的謀生聽說現在也難了，第一因為灣　石脚，許多都被鋼筋水泥所封鎖，第二是日本的漁船南來日多，他們是有更好的方法括索　裏的魚的。</p>
<p>黃昏中，我從這隻　大的白色的ConteVerde上，望見一羣蒼黑的魚船時，在這幅美妙的海景中，我感到一種無限的凄凉，我想，假如我道時是立在那蒼黑小船上，望那白色的大船，我的感想又是怎樣為牠的龐大的白色不是一種沉重的壓迫與恐怕麼？</p>
<p>但是白輪起行了，遺留那裏一點在山色的旁邊，供給那白色洋房裏入們的海味；而輪哀則多了許多人，那位一集團軍總司令陳濟棠先生，也帶着他汽車與　從，在皇宮般頭等艙裏，向香港別了，遙望那山外的廣州，遠屬那萬裏的前程，將起什麽樣的感想呢？我似乎看見從洋房到黑色魚船的是一個一個黑色的銅元而從將軍由白大輪出去的是成千成萬的黃色金鎊呀！</p>

<p>汽車執照</p>
<p>其人與虹口醫院兩屍案有關、遂由黃·崔·兩探目前往、將陳提回偵查之下、得悉陳實為在逃主犯梁梅玉之弟、經梁之介紹、於八月廿九日起、卽在張文華處充當開汽車之職、張所乘之車號碼為七二〇三號、張除虹口女科醫院外、尙在民國路三百七十號設有診所、張每日</p>

<p>顧玉波等創辦之美華銀行、倒閉以後、初由該行英籍董事長孟雷·英籍董事耶魯·及馬來脫·等三人、向第一特區地方法院以刑事控顧與股東愛董事陳熠哉·鮑孑文·詐欺背信、並附帶民訴、追賠損失、繼而有該行債權人王廷芳等十四戶、延鄥鵬律師對張·陳·鮑·曁其他負責之張序笙·孫文魁·李軼　·劉同福·王仲麟·等提起</p>
<p>侵佔詐欺</p>
<p>之刑事目訴、兩案業經迭决傳審、祗孫文魁被傳到庭、論令責付其辯護律師林濚慶保出、其餘被吿除顧玉波下令通緝外，分別再傳各情、已誌前報、查美華銀行之前身為大信銀行、大信乃蔣百里·林康侯·錢承緒·沈敬仲·等所發起、嗣以股欵難以籌足、註冊復不易為、旋得李軼儔之居間拉攏、始與顧玉波合作、併為美華銀行、顧為號召計、</p>
<p>更集洋股</p>
<p>故其初希得美僑投資、俾稱美商、因不能如願、改邀英僑孟雷等三人加入、並向英領事署註册、遂稱英商、其實孟雷·耶魯·馬來脫·各祇承認一股、而每人之股本一百元、迄未繳付、昨日下午、為孟等所訴之案繼續審理之期、原吿又增加陳惠卿·陳銘記·袁伯齡·陳曉邨·陳冠蟑·馬君襄·馬贊明·七戶、而大信之發起人蔣百里·林康侯，錢承緒·沈敬仲·亦被與</p>

<p>同列為被吿、但到案者則祗孫文魁·王仲鱗·兩名、其陳熠哉·鮑孑文·兩被吿之家屬、同延江一平律師到庭、聲明陳·鮑·亦各被顧玉波編去五萬元、現因顧逃逸無踪、陳·鮑·兩人·以非顧到庭、則彼輩縱自投案、必蒙</p>
<p>不利、是以陳·飽·已離家出外、尋覔顧踪、實非避不到案、今原吿請求票拘、敝律師要求庭上再予展寬時日、容將顧尋獲、或俟陳·鮑·歸來、命其報案云云、而張序笙亦延錢錚律師代表出庭、聲明張</p>
<p>臥病在杭</p>
<p>請求展期、庭上遂决定先審孟雷等三英人訴顧·陳·飽詐欺背信一案、據該三原告供、彼等每人各認一股、計股本一百元、迄均未付、孟雷因兼會計職務、故月薪為三百五十元、但僅支過一月、耶·馬·兩人、則皆未支薪、彼等個人、並未受及損失、起訴目的、純為存戶利益計、倘得判被吿賠償損失、則所獲當歸銀行、備償債權云云、嗣由為該行淸理之會計師報吿</p>
<p>查核賬目</p>
<p>情形、謂大信移交美華時、所造之資產負債表、其股本名為六十萬、而實收祗三十四萬五千元、又所記存放中央·花旂·兩銀行二十一萬數千元、經查明並無分毫存儲、故此表記載。因無賬簿核對、殊難定其是否實在也、末由原吿律師辯論一過、黃推事諭候本月二十九日下午宣判、旋卽接連審訊王廷芳所訴、當由林濚慶律師代表被吿孫文魁</p>
<p>提出證據</p>
<p>謂孫旣非該行襄理、復非該行股東、但原吿代理律師鄥鵬、仍主張孫確屬襄理、目為股東、繳有三千元之股欵、因其時未發股票、乃將其欵權作暫時存欵、復由前在美華公司接電話之女子黃雲到案作證云、曾聞同事言、孫亦股東之一份子、黃推事硏訊至此、因時已暮、遂諭改期再訊、</p>

<p>前日午後</p>
<p>記者離寓甫抵弄口、瞥見二三男女、竊竊私議、初未注意、最後忽聞得「打胎非常危險」一語、記者乃止步相詢「何人需要打胎」、當　一劉姓少年云、「最近有乃妻同鄉二女友、自平</p>
<p>唯一目的</p>
<p>蓋兩人已珠胎暗結、為期均相屆四閱月矣者番相偕來滬、乃係專誠延醫墮胎、而謀操皮肉生涯者、但余覺墮胎一事、旣乏人道、且屬危險、故余　不願參加斯議、惟惜兩女持意甚堅、恐志在必行也」云云、記者聞少年一席話、不禁</p>

<p>人非草木</p>
<p>孰能無情，人雖至憑，誰不惜命、余（該女自稱）等雖屬鄕間弱女、但微受相當敎育近年以來、農村破產、余等因生活問題不得已而與苟合、蓋卽所謂鄕問暗娼者是也、乃天不憐人、不幸竞種孽根、迄今已逾四月、在此初孕期中、淫業尙能勉為支持、此後</p>
<p>便便打腹</p>
<p>將不獲繼續維持矣、若俟其正式產生、為期將及半載、而產後休養、至少又須兩月之久、試問在此八個月之長期過程中、生活問題、如何解决、故余夙夜籌思、與其待正式生產而為餓莩，不若冒一時之險較為得計、余等環境如此、先生（稱記者）</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>—勿細信化學藥品殺菌之迷惑—</p>
<p>今日市上販售之療肺藥品。種類繁多。不勝枚舉。其誇大如何特效者。一經臨床實騐。均歸泡影。殆暴露其全然無效。但世之肺病患者。因受其惑。以致坐誤正當治療之時期。而自陷於不救之人。正不知凡幾也。</p>
<p>按肺結核之病原。為結核桿菌。凡稍有科學常識者類多知之。此菌之抵抗力極為强大。任何药剂。皆不易撲滅之。近世醫藥之進步雖速。而能直接殺滅癆菌之特效藥。尚未發明。吾人治療結核之原則。乃以嗇人身之抵抗力。間接使疾病痊愈并不能直接釘菌也。</p>
<p>化學室內之試騐管中。能直接撲殺結核菌之藥劑雖多。然皆有猛烈之毒性。若將牠用於人體內。在撲滅結核菌之前。人體必先受莫大之損害。况藥物。無論內服及注射。必須經過血管同血液循環全身到病灶方能發揮其效力。惟結核病灶在肺臟組織之一隅。并無血管。茲卽使有安全殺菌之藥品。其效力亦無從發顯。換言之。病原菌繁殖之處。非藥劑所能達到者。故此等化學藥品之作用於體內結核菌之不可靠。可以知之矣。</p>
<h3 id="c146">肺病最新療法之發展 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>—臟器製劑之內服為確定有根據最切實合理—</p>
<p>肺結核又名肺癆病。其病原為結核菌（卽癆蟲）此菌侵入肺臟後。卽於肺部滋生繁殖。而發生硬結。故有肺結核之名也。</p>
<p>結核菌（癆蟲）不易撲滅之理由。已如上述。然則肺病將何以治愈乎？此無他。惟有恃啁人體內天然之防禦力。由白血球將結核菌團困。而於其外又生結締織為之堤防。築成堅固之防禦線。使此菌不能奪圍而出。併絕其糧道。其後該菌方歸死滅。故以結核菌生活力之頑强。非吾人有此天然之防禦機能。實不足以制其死命也。故近世學者咸以治療肺病之唯一方法。全在乎生理的防禦機能之消長。即身體與病菌戰爭勝敗之所由分也。</p>
<p>夫與結核菌（癆蟲）戰。以包圍結核之病灶。待敵自滅之為得策。故肺結核（肺癆）之自然治愈。實亦根據此原理。吾人欲達肺病治愈之目的。則當明此自然療法之妙機。作為應戰之方針。此應戰之鐵軍。即臟器療法是也。此種臟器製劑。得世界醫師之推獎者。祇有「肺活」dhith　Weal一藥。確有根據而切實有效。</p>
<p>肺病患者因病魔久續於身體。則此等天然防禦之機能衰退。抵抗力薄弱。故病菌猖獗蔓延。如入無人之境。則肺病進行不已。終為癆菌所殺死。因此欲撲滅癆菌。治愈肺病則不得不藉人力之補助以增進其體內之防禦機能。使抵抗力强大。如此方足以尅服病菌。而達到痊愈之目的。惟此種增進防禦機能之方法。并非任何開始化學藥劑所能奏效。祇有臟器制劑之「肺活」dhith　Weal有此特效耳。</p>
<p>按「肺活」dhith　Weal係採取壯健動物新鮮肺臟與脾臟中提出之內分泌素——荷爾蒙——混合製成內服之後。其功用能使已衰萎之肺臟機能復活。促進其抵抗力。而使生理的自然治愈之機能旺盛。增生結締細胞。而塡補其組織之缺損。同時在病部之周圍。築成鞏固結締纖之牆壁。使之硬化。促其疤痕之結合。完全包裹惡魔之結核菌（癆菌）禁其活動。終必使其完全消滅。以至痊愈。故患者於服用「肺活」dhith　Weal之後。不數日卽感覺精神爽快。食慾增進。咯痰稀有權。咳嗽减少。潮熱·盜汗·與血痰等。皆見消失。倘連續服用。同時并注意一般衛生療法。確能於極短期內。完全根治。故此種臟器療法發現以來。其多年稱霸之化學藥劑療法。今日已為治療界所厭棄。行將為之消滅矣。</p>

<p>— Dr．H，W．Robert著　章元貞醫師譯</p>
<p>——治療過程中的三步驟之認識——</p>
<p>遺精是性神經衰弱的一個症候。僅僅發起遺精的很少。講到發生性神經衰弱的原因。大多數由於房事過度和手淫的結果。還有一種慢性淋病達到的後部尿道，攝護腺，射精管，因為炎症的刺戟。發起反射的射精。而成為遺精的原因。也是很多。所以有患過淋病的人。常時因上發起遺精和早洩（卽交接短時間內洩精）。</p>
<p>夜間的遺精。多是因夢而起的射精。此種名為夢遺。陰莖大多勃起。有時候若沒有美快感和陰莖的勃起。也有精液漏出者。這是呌做精液漏。是和遺精有區別的。亦有在日間。因陰部受些微的刺戟。或精神的感動。而發生遺精者。是曰見色流精。又曰日間遺精。還有在排尿和排便的時候。精液從尿道漏出。此種並非因色情的昂奮所起。也是精液漏的一種。（俗稱滑精）。如非排便時。自尿道排出少許乳白色的液體。這是呌做攝護腺漏。並不是精液。那是攝護腺的分泌物。在慢性疾侵犯到攝護腺的時候。往往會發起這樣的攝護腺漏。和精液漏。</p>
<p>遺精的結果。大多覺得倦怠。沒有氣力。頭腦不清。厭惡業務。為學生的人。也不願意用功。頭痛。頭重。記憶和思考力都覺到衰退。一般都陷於憂鬰。終致成為强度的神腦經衰弱症—健忘，失眠，身體消瘦。生理上各部的機能衰退。對於種種疾病的抵抗力缺乏。所以患遺精過甚的人。都容易發生肺癆病。即因此故。</p>
<p>患遺精的人。要知道遺精是生殖器性的神經衰弱一個症候。欲求治愈。自然應當照片神經衰弱的療法醫治才對。</p>
<p>第一步的療法。須設法塞住那個漏洞。不可以再放牠失去一滴寶貴的精液。隨時用强精補腎劑。補其以前損失了的元氣。這樣才可算是根本治療法。挽回一切危機。</p>
<p>治療遺精的藥品。市間種類雖多。但是有效者。等於鳳毛麟角之難求。那些固精片。效力單薄姑置不論。並且那些藥片的副作用倒很厲害。往往於服用之後。效力未見。則先已發現頭脹，胃呆，惡心，嘔吐，便秘等流弊。因此延誤病機。防害治愈的事情。不知見過多少。</p>
<p>依吾臨床所得到的經騐來講。治療過程應分為三個步驟。第一步須服用「福郞」片Fonan止其遺洩。（每夜臨睡時吞服三片。大槪用至兩瓶可全愈）。第二步應用强精補腎劑。以睪丸精所製之「還爾童」Well　Tonic為最有效果。在服用本品之後。所有腎虧而起之陽萎，早洩，等症。（即所謂生殖器機能障碍）均可迅速治愈。對於夫婦的性生活。自然有美滿的收獲。第三步是强壯神經系統。因為遺精多出由神經衰弱發起。故須用神經補劑。而市上普通的補藥（如魚肝油鐵，燐，鈣，等）是絕對無效的。惟有「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic有此特效。據臨床用者報告。凡患神經衰弱之人。服用本品之後。所現一切衰弱病象都迅見消失。自覺頭腦清晰。精神爽快元。氣倍增。思想靈敏。身體各部的機能。均呈活潑現象。生氣蓬勃。有同新生命之重到人間的快樂。</p>
<p>著者附註——上列三種藥品。患者須同時進服。並不分前後。且此等藥品。性質皆甚和善。無任何流弊。極其安全。患者自行購服。頗為簡便。效力甚著。確非其他同類藥品所可冀及者也。</p>

<p>— 陳和貞女醫師</p>
<p>月經是女性本身上的重大的事情。月經痛—也是女性本身上的難堪的苦痛。使處女時代苦痛的月經—是月經過多。月經反常等。尤其是在做職業婦人而走出街頭的女性逐漸增多的現代。這個月經病的女性之苦惱。便更其深刻而增加起來了。月經停滯。月經過多。日期不定等的月經反常，差不多是與某種原因——尤其是女性的性病的疾患有關連着的。</p>
<p>月經痛—通常是在月經時腰部有多少的鈍痛。這是誰也經騐過的。但是這個痛有非常利害—恰似產時的陳痛那樣的痛。在月經來潮前發生於薦骨部的。而於經血之流出同時。那個像陣痛的痛。也稍漸减輕下去。至月經終了。那個痛便像陣痛一般地消失了。</p>
<p>編者按—月經為成年女子最宜注意之一。不僅關於身體之健康。抑且影響及於生育。故色之深淡。期之前後。胥有莫大之關係。而行經時之腹痛。尤屬不宜忽視焉。月經痛之療法。以服用『美奴寗』Menorrin為最有效。在月經前數日預先服用。可免除經期內一切痛苦。本品乃世界著名之婦女保健藥品。專治月經不調各症。且有强身補血之功。在虛弱婦女。服用尤宜。卽孕婦服之。亦能安胎平產。毫無流弊。</p>

<p>— 顧子高醫師</p>
<p>淋濁一症。傳染最易。根治最難。近年以來在花柳病中。非常猖獗。設不幸而佔染之。則時愈時發。遺審終身。今雖有種種治淋淋品。但皆僅能暫時見效。欲求一肅清淋菌。根治病原之劑。實難得如鳳毛麟角。此一般臨床醫家。所以引為憾事也。近有DR．H．S．PUCH醫博士。經數年苦心研究。澈底實騐後。發明一種內體消毒之新劑是。名曰918ANTI-GONO-TAB．（譯為九一八白濁片）本品具有强大滲透力。及完美之殺菌作用。功能剿滅藏匿深處之病原菌。為治療急慢性淋疾之唯一聖品。且并無任何副作用。尤為此藥之特式。余試用以來。均獲奇效。確定有推獎之價值。</p>

<p>昨週四逢元芳洋行第三〇〇八次拍賣，陳列泰西緞元絨貢呢綢洋紅布五種，計西　　牌，共七十七箱，向有漂細布及洋紗府綢洋藍布四種，外洋無貨到，故未列入，呌價市况頗健，有漲無跌，泰西綢加採北極一色天兩牌，因久無貨到，業中爭購，且餘各牌碼價升一分左右，元絨貢呢皆見微升，羽綢市狀客帮及內地秋交發動，拍賣占優勢，彩八士牌疋價漲一元一角半之榮，其餘人球竹林海天十八子二元第伯子六牌漲六角前後，五星賜樂安殿寶燕國公四牌已升四五角，餘皆漲一二角，洋紅布呌六磅貨價尙占優云，</p>
<h3 id="c182">糧食　交割已邇　粉麥近俏遠跌 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>粉市以洋麥報訊，漲落互見，無重要借鏡，獲利浮多，乘上日盤面提高，陸續出籠，而業外巨戶，以公債見落，無進取之心，故遠期各月，一致下降，惟本月交易，拍至今日為止，多空籌碼，提前結束，初時當胃尙旺，盤面亦趨下游，嗣空頭抵補，額子漸形缺乏，故下午本月份頓漲二分外，略有軋空之象，惟原料尙形挺秀，賣方亦乏積極舉動，暫時地位或可穩定，全日成近俏遠跌之局，較前日收盤價，本月份漲一分一厘半，十月份不動，十一月小二厘半，十二月小七厘半，一月份小一分七厘半，二月份小一分，</p>
<p>麥市昨上午開盤後，以洋麥電訊，芝加哥近跌四分，遠跌　角　分，芝加哥近小四分，遠好四分，利物浦漲　辨士，國外市况，無重大影響惟以公債下降，而粉市亦呈衰落，購買受阻，散多又相繼出範，市氣逐步不振，惟以現麥云化尙佳，本月份交貨心思淡泊，額子逐有收回，致成近漲遠跌之局，全日結果，本月份好起一分，十月份跌四分，十一月份二月各跌二分，十二月一月各小一分，現麥市面，依舊挺秀，穎州等高麥仍開五元一角五分，全日成交七千包，計申大進五千包，阜豐進二千包云，</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源，與前相仿，共到有三十四五號，貨共三千石，本街銷塲，動而不暢，包胄期較前活絡，青島帮辦薄破七百餘包及百哥三百餘包故市况似有轉定之訣，惟以裏疲已久，驟振恐亦不易，新粳及百哥等新薄稻雖到貨漸湧，而行情僅略貶一角，新料洋等尖悉呈高定次軟之局，新陰千元亦無榮辱，厚早破貨稀守原盤，薄破與前市相仿，包胄平定，云化續降角許，總之大局趨勢，際此出新日湧之期，欲求轉好，本屬難能，惟價格日見抑低，客銷店胄或可稍稍暢達，亦未可知耳，</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮嚴三十餘號，市上各我銷胄破粳變元各尖尙佳，薄稻東新平常，市價破粳變元新埠尖挺立，薄稻價削一二角，東新粳價小一角，新羊圈杜尖茭白秈新客尖等，價仍平定，本新粳又疲數分至近角，</p>

<p>昨日上海絲市，緊定如前，內外絲銷仍告停頓，下午人心雖稍見疲弱，但亦未有顯著轉動之象，邇來白廠售盤較前約漲三十元，廠商對價漲五十元許，歐美及內銷，大敢相同，昨日紐約橫濱近期絲價，均緊穩如前，遠期則微落半分及五元，申埠絲市成交僅九十包，價格如前，唯市氣已稍見遜色，</p>

<p>糯米枝據產區函訊，存底業已不多，故產價極堅，有升無降，此間號盤亦甚挺秀，經前漲起五六元，行方售價高貨呌一百二十元，</p>

<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>晚上了，依然沒有一點風。走出印刷所，衝到鼻頭來的還是那股慹騰騰蒸氣，晚上出來兜風的汽車特別多，Shell和Socory明亮的招牌出神地眯着眼。我透一口氣：排字房裏的油墨味，換了這陣更難聞的軋士林了。</p>
<p>匆匆地在人行道上走回去，心頭沒有一絲兒遐想，一天的工作把什麽全忘了，只剩下這點飢餓，它時時在提議，向我抗議。</p>
<p>在一盞路燈下，我的肩上來了一下重擊。</p>
<p>「嘿，原來是你啊！多少年不見了，多少年——」說話的人顯然是被突然的激熱給包圍住了，有點上氣不接下氣。那因瘦削而到中年特別顯得高的鼻子是一個最淸楚的標誌：那不是作綢業買賣的遠房叔叔麼？</p>
<p>「大鼻子，又來販貨了嗎」？我握了一下他那靑筋畢露的瘦手，然而，為了終年藏在長袖裏的原故，它們却是白皙的，我已來不及瞧瞧那七年前的結婚戒指在那白手上是否仍有當年的風情。</p>
<p>他一點不驚訝這不客氣的稱呼，也天眞地笑起來，但馬上又收攏：「野孩子，整天跑什麼？就不想家麼？如今離得這麼近了，也不常回去瞧瞧，也可以來望望大鼻子叔叔的啊！」</p>
<p>我轉過身來指一指才剛走出來的地方，吿訴他那是我的工作地。</p>
<p>「小心你的肺尖！」他驀地關切地警吿我。他還記得我這先天遺傳的缺憾。</p>
<p>一時沒有回他話，却只顧兩個人向我的住處走去。走到轉角的一家汽車行時，大鼻子的眼睛閃了一閃，隨口讀着那大玻璃窗上的脾子什麽的。</p>
<p>「一九三六，唔，好難過的年頭！多少離奇事全出來了：」他好像靈機一動，觸到了心裏的鬱積，嘆口氣：</p>
<p>知道麽？早先我們的房東韓四爺弔死了哩！那烟鬼，為了二年來田上空白，小地主作不成了，先起頭賣房子，到去年縣裏追他繳納錢糧，逃呀逃的，避風是避成了。可是飯呢，還有個的黑飯！這中年的小夥子上個月就——。」</p>
<p>「滾他娘的！這些壯年的中年的老年的魔障，命運全一樣，早晚你瞧瞧着吧！喂，韓四爺的年輕太太不是拿出壓妝奩箱的一張初師文憑去當了小學敎員了嗎？」我從隱的的記憶中抓出這點史蹟。</p>
<p>大鼻子拍拍我的肩：「好丫頭，說你對家鄉沒有良心是冤枉的，敢請你全　着哪。唔，那當敎員的少奶奶嗎？二十塊錢一月的小學敎員也多不了什麽錢養活韓四爺，這女人是滿有主意的，人也聰明，敎了半年書挺有勁，末末了兒她把三個孩子全帶走啦，和烟鬼說：「孩子我領着，你自顧去！」你的得，這就一刀兩斷，沒了錢，烟鬼也使不出威風……」</p>
<p>我們邁過人行道上的人堆，人們關好了自家的狹小的家門，跑到街邊來乘凉，無家可歸的漢子和幼童們找到僻暗點的犄角兒躺下，仰天安息了，時常會在夢裏挨到一棍子或是一隻皮鞋。</p>
<p>「這種日子！」大鼻子瞧着這人堆發愁，好像深怕有一天這不宰的事，這苦難會壓到他頭上，在有了一點發冷的預感，道中年人的苦悶也在一天天加深了，早就聽到他們舖子裏賠錢的消息，年底就在週轉不靈，差點兒關鬥。</p>
<p>「想想睢呌我們過這種日子的吧！叔叔，知道近來家鄉四郊農民的怒吼吧，將來——」我忘不了唯一的使我興奮的故鄉近年史料。被打在地底下多年的肥猪們的豢養者也翻起來了。</p>
<p>一陣孩氣的激熱使我瞅瞅黝暗的天空，它明天會亮的，不是麽？於是我挺挺胸脯</p>
<p>「那個，太野了啊，不過，也是個道理，雖然要犧牲一點……家鄉也是變了樣兒了，就是在茶館裏，縱聲大笑被一些窮愁壓倒了，大家酒醉似的嘆息這壓到天堂來的掃帚星，數說着生活的沒辦法，沒有多少人再有閒錢和閒情來呌一聲賣唱，或吃些鱔絲麵或蝦肉包子。在這裏組織脾局的也少了：賭來賭去是欠賬，沒興頭。眞應該去看看這破落的小城了呢！」</p>
<p>我把步子放慢一點，不理會他的勸吿，另一個念頭爬起來：</p>
<p>「我有幾個，堂妹堂弟哪？大鼻子！」</p>
<p>深陷下去的眼珠動了一動：「糊塗鬼，連這都忘了，好薄的交情！但又怨誰呢？你大鼻子嬸嬸太會生孩子了啊，到今年冬天，小五快出世了，我們店裏是一年不如一年，年底一點紅利也多不到了，老闆還直想關門不幹哩！他說的「餐活」我們，自己撈不到達好處，還得担心、也是怪，兩毛錢一尺的綢子還少人買，人造絲，缺德的，把家鄕的絲廠擠關了門，大堆桑葉瞧它在樹上發芽抽葉，由它枯老由它掉地！聰明的却連根也刨了！」</p>
<p>他像出氣似地把一肚子冤曲倒出來：「你嬸子呌我別吃這碗飯了，痛痛快快開個小店完事，女人家眞是不懂得艱難，大店開不起，小店不够過日子。知道那由「藝術家」（他特別加透着說，我知道是指那個過去給文明戲班置佈景的。）而開雜貨舖的朱老二吧？先起頭多威風，走碼頭，打官話，這幾夭正為了小雜貨舖的房租受着逼擠，東借西拉的，然而道年頭——」大鼻子抽措了一下，「借錢不比雄雞生蛋還難麽？」</p>
<p>不過，够急跳牆，慢慢地人會……」</p>
<p>大鼻子馬上接過去：「這朱老二已經跳了牆啦！那天房東找了警察來逼房租，不交錢要把櫃古打了，近五十歲的朱老二可眞動了肝火，指指自己糊的其器，（這是無可奈何的副業，他是紥佈景的啊！）把拳頭仲到警察的帽邊：「你要，老子送你這個，送你歸西天吧！吿訢你：石子是逼不出油來！」喝，我的野孩子，朱老二吃了一連串的巴掌，他漲紅了臉，抓起一把板凳就……</p>
<p>（朱老二是這一條街的面子人啊，走過碼頭，出過省縣，那受得了道些！）」</p>
<p>不用他說，我老早猜到那結果了；「判幾年還沒一定，就是朱老二的媳婦還在帶了孩子上監獄鬧，要一塊兒坐牢，她說在外面她有了能作活的手沒飯吃，不如一塊兒吃「砂米飯」者……」</p>
<p>大鼻子興奮得臉紅了，我好像看出來。握着的手也一會兒比一會兒燙起來，我知道是一種什麼激憤在他心頭躍動，最後，他扯扯自己的綢大褂：</p>
<p>「總有一個時候，大鼻子叔叔會脫了這件綢大褂，眞的，信麽，野東西？眞脫了它——和那時候還理叔叔麽？」</p>
<p>對他這天眞的發問怔住了，我快活地：「怎麼不理，不但理，而且還和大鼻子握緊了手一道走呢，今天似的。」我舒落地笑了。</p>
<p>大鼻子也半懂地憨笑着。</p>
<p>「到了家，進去麽？」我在一個嘈雜的弄堂前玷住了。</p>
<p>「不了，」他看看錶，「太晚了，我原是找一家同行去的，店是為了節關沒了的一些賬務，呌我來辦的，明天回去—」</p>
<p>在他的好意的「你也回來瞧瞧啊！」的好話的回聲下，我掏出開後門的鑰匙。</p>
<p>一點煩燥，一點驚喜，一點蕪亂夾雜在心頭，我有點茫然，然而—</p>
<p>不是鄉愁！</p>

<h3 id="c189">人物底單純與複雜 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>作品中人物，要能招引讀者，莫善於將人物寫得單純化。</p>
<p>所謂單純化，那就是寫個英雄，必須澈頭澈尾是英雄，寫個流氓，必須澈頭澈尾是流氓。</p>
<p>但這種單純化的人物，為什麼能招引讀者呢？這理由許是我們底生活不很複雜，還不能理解所描出的，複雜的人物底一切行動與思想。一般中學生歡喜看感情的，或傷感的作品，便是一個例子。</p>
<p>但也許還有別的理由。</p>
<p>這事實，可用幾年前專門寫澈頭澈尾的革命家的蔣光赤的小說風行一時，來作例證。便是現在，雖然這種作風稍稍改變了一點。但寫可笑的人物，則全是一付鼻干抹着白粉的臉，彷彿那人物於他可笑的生活外，別無一點認眞之處；描寫革命家或愛國志士，也全是一付冷冰冰的臉，或愁眉苦臉，或面紅耳赤到底，彷彿那些人生活在半空里，全沒有自己底私生活的。像那樣作品，到現在還是一樣被歡迎。</p>
<p>自然，我們的作者也知道人物底單純化，是多少帶些非眞實性的。於是描寫人物時，知道人物之個性底變動。他們很巧妙地把人物與環境相配合起來。把人物從這一個極端變到那一極端，比如把不革命的人在革命環境中變做了革命者，把消極的或意志薄弱的人，在某種環境下變做了積極的或意志堅强的人。於是讀者也在這人物底轉變中奮興起來，終於被作者抓住了。</p>
<p>這　的是，這樣的辦法，也還是單純化底另一變態。從單純的甲端，變做單純的乙端。不過把兩個單純的人物拼成個吧了。若與眞實的人物相較量起來，則相距還是極遠的。</p>
<p>這原因，都在於作者並沒有手觸生活。沒有手觸生活，祗憑耳聞或冷眼旁觀，那作者永遠不會了解生活。</p>
<p>然而作為一個作者是不得不裝作了解生活的，於是聰明的作者，憑藉其所謂正確的觀念，將人物撑起架子，穿上衣裳，略略　一書眉目，呌他直脚的行動起來。但所謂行動，仍舊在拿代　者底手里，成為木偶底演出而已。</p>
<p>這大槪也就是公式主義的作品吧！而公式的形成，大槪也由於作者底生活的空疎吧！</p>
<p>但也有許多作者，他們的確是手觸過生活的。而在其寫出的塲合，常常不免有人物太過單純化之嫌。雖然　人物底單純，却也頗為生動，而並不是機械的單純。這原因是由於作者太過注意了讀者的口胃，一定要設法以一定的形貌，一定的言行，引起讀者底興趣；那麽就從其所執習的現實的人物中，將其所要的，配合他主題的成分抽象出來，來搆成一種舞台性的人物。這也小說之所以馬小說吧。然而一藉小說，使讀者在誦讀時，不忘其為小說時，那麼，他那距離現實之眞實性已經稍遠些了。在這里，我們並不吾定在構造人物時，從見實人物中抽象出來的成分；問題是在要構造個活生生的人物，却須從各個現實人物中抽出其各種生要的或决要的成分，予以配合起來，而使其成為典型化。典型化，决不是單純化。</p>
<p>有的作者所寫出時人物底單純，是山於愛　其實人物。愛寫實有人物，常凝滯於人物底表面？不能深人於實有人物底內心生活。有時，且以作者對於實有人物關於人事上底愛憎程度底不同，而予以極端的肯定，或極端的吾定。這趨向之最惡劣的結果，便是以文藝作品作為人身攻擊。現實底眞實性上，蒙上了作者中觀的面紗。作者底卑劣是暴露出來了，而被攻擊的人物，反而隱晦得看不出來。</p>
<p>由於這兩種創作方法上底缺陷而創造出來的人物底單純，雖然不能說是完全脫離現實底眞實。但總不能顯現實人物底全貌。所謂現實人物底全貌，並不是某實有人物底確實的紀實，而是指人物底典型底　越。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>在實有人物中，一　說來勤勞者較為單純，知識階級較為複雜。但也祗程度上底差異。單純也决不會單純到澈頭澈尾，如我們過去革命文學　品里所顯示，英雄似的。</p>
<p>高爾基在寫他底馬爾華和拆爾卡士時，彷彿是比較單純的。但一樣有他的複雜處，馬爾華對於父子兩人底愛是不同的，而對於另一流氓底愛更不同了。這里在她心里底感觀是複雜的，雖然通過她底全性格，是以一種單純的浮浪女的線條貫串着。但正惟這樣的寫法馬爾華是活的。</p>
<p>可是在他寫克里姆，沙姆金時，他却以複雜的線條述綴起來，而在其終極上，又顯出這位智識階級出身的人物底生活底單純。</p>
<p>在這小說第三部燎原里，高爾奉同樣描寫出一個極其複雜的智識階級的女人馬利娜。她同悄革命，有時却還接濟革命，但她實際上則入出於貴族之門，以分敎派的倡導，而承繼別人的遺產，嘴上想以精神來代替上帝，實際則唯歛錢為命，且以種種肉感的行動，引誘作為她辯護士底沙姆金。這人眞可謂複雜極了，但說來也不免單純。在這兩人的工作與生活中，除坐而談論一切外，擬於物慾之外，便永遠沒有別的事要做。馬利娜批評沙姆金說：</p>
<p>『你們知識分子之類，是慣於用許多問題來裝飾自己，炫耀別人的。你們賣弄複雜，好像是說，「看誰更複雜些」？而你們不過是把彼此弄得糾纏不淸吧了。因為問題的解决並不由於理性，而由於意志。……理性不過是從旁幫忙吧了。也祗有意志才能敎導人怎樣自由地行走。」</p>
<p>這話楚極其正確的。但馬利娜本人也複雜得極其神秘。在這里，我們祗聽到馬利娜一切的言論的正確，但她底行動却使人感到神秘。她倡導分敎派，反對基督敎；而她又同情革命，與革命者以接濟，她想改善沙姆金底彷彿為懶惰所支配的那種精神，最後以在慹的信仰——精神的信仰，引誘他，結果反嚇跑了他，終於離開了馬利娜。這眞是一部極複雜的工筆的寫生盡，讀者如其沒有耐性是不容易終篇的。</p>
<p>在中國作品中所處理的人物，可說大都是智識分子。但我們在作品中所看到的知識分子，竞單純得光呌人愛或憎：也許中國的智識分子比較單純一點。但還有他們底悲哀和快樂，憤怒和冷靜，怯弱和堅决，有他們底對於集團的良心和私人底慾望，有他們底正義感和權利思想。——這種相互矛盾，相互撞着的個性，為什麼我們沒有人表現呢。我們作家的作品中人物，實在太要求單純化了</p>
<p>但我們還是期待着。期待着有描寫通過一時代的複雜的複雜人物出現。雖然，這是比較不易為讀者所歡迎，但複雜的時代，將會推進讀者的理解吧!</p>
<h3 id="c190">阿花的死 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 林石</p>
<p>算起來已是今年春天的事，不過牠—阿花—給與我的印象却在我心頭烙下了火印，到現在想起來，還像今天早晨的事一樣淸楚。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：我的房主人呂師母，為了每天要榨兩磅牛肉汁給她的兩個白胖的兒子吃，多下來許多肉渣滓完全沒有滋味。隨意扔在拉垃圾桶裏，未免可惜，給討飯的罷，又覺得不大妥當，於是她從女壻——四姑爺家裏，要了一隻雌貓來。自然，一方面為了捉老鼠，而另一方面無非是作為牛肉渣滓的消化機，這使呂師母思攷了好些時候的嚴重問題終於解决了。這隻貓，呂師母給牠取了一個很適當的名字：阿花，牠全身是黃白黑三色雜亂的原故。</p>
<p>對於阿花，我不大歡喜，旣不全白，又不全黑，不合乎我關於貓的偏見。不消說，這在牠毫無關係，牠旣不為我所有，我沒有豢養牠的責任，只有呂師每天不忘了敎娘姨給牛肉渣牠吃。不要多久，牠也就肥胖起來了。</p>
<p>春天悄悄地來到人間也悄悄地離開阿花在那時候屋前屋後的呌了好幾夜，後來也就不呌了。不過我無意之間發現阿花更加胖了，而且壯皮大了起來，我知道牠快要做母親了。同時又發現了一隻雄貓，跟着牠左右不離，這使我奇異起來。問了妻，才知道是阿花的丈夫，是一個月以前招贅來的，哦！我恍悟的笑了、妻也笑也、但是呂師母考慮的結果却和我們大不相同，她深恨這外來的貓，每天要分吃阿花的牛渣肉滓之一半，覺得太不應該，所以常用木棍追着雄貓毒打，趕出門外，不准牠冉進來，可是過不多久，又可發現阿花和牠藏在廚房的桌子下咪嗚咪嗚的呌，牠從窗戶裏或鐵門下悄悄的溜進來，眞是太容易了。</p>
<p>有一夜那正是淸明時節，窗外細雨霏霏，凄凉得很。全屋子裏的人都睡了，只有我一個還伏在案頭對着一盞古舊的燈摸索。一隻貓在呌喚前前後後上上下下的斷續的佈滿了牠的哭聲，怪慘的，尤其是在深夜。我聽得出這是阿花，牠的聲音對於我太熟習了。但是牠為什麼哭呢？誰傷害了牠呢？使我聯想起妻子死了丈夫，母親死了兒子，這人間悲慘的號呌，刺痛了靜止的心，同時使我忍受不住。我懷着憤怒去追打阿花，不管這權行動是否殘　；咳嗽當我逼近牠的時候牠便敏捷的逃走了。然而還是咪嗚咪嗚的號呌，顯然我的恐嚇並不能制止牠的悲哀。就是這樣，我給牠吵閙得心頭不能得着片刻的寗靜，我只好停止我的工作，憤怒的喊醒早已睡了的妻，妻吿訴我呂師母敎車夫阿二將那隻雄貓趕過了幾條馬路，使牠認不得回來守住牠快生產的妻，這便是阿花所以哭泣的理由；於是我心頭冰冷了。</p>
<p>阿花整整的呌了一通夜，第二天還是呌，可是牠的丈夫並沒有聽見牠的聲音，從此以後便孤零零的過了好些時候，一直到牠的生產。</p>
<p>阿花生了兩隻小貓，我記不淸楚是什麽時候的事，不過據妻說一隻是胎生的跛脚，而這對於我也不大介意。至於她為什麽要告訴我這個呢？這也有一個原因：原來阿花跳上了我家的碗櫥，將裏面的碗全打碎了，累得妻氣得滿臉發白。我說：</p>
<p>「阿花一定肚皮餓了，所以偷吃。」</p>
<p>「可不是」，妻回答我說：「呂師母的孩子不吃牛肉汁了，連帶着阿花沒有肉渣吃，而且臭魚拌飯也不給牠吃飽，牠又得奶水喂小貓，愈敎她怎麽不饞嘴？」</p>
<p>「小貓好玩兒嗎？是不是全白的？」</p>
<p>「好玩兒呢？有一隻生下地就是跛脚，走也走不動。</p>
<p>我不知道呂師母是否就因為生了跛脚兒子而惱恨她呢？還是有了旁的原故，有一天晚上我發現阿花在我窗前的魚釭捉金魚吃，我證明了牠確是餓得難受。果然第二天呂師母發現了魚缸少了一條「龍種」將阿花狠狠地打了一頓。</p>
<p>隻貓因為偷吃而挨了打，這自然是極其平凡的事，然而有的時候也會使你從中畜生身上而悟出人生的悲哀。為了自己的饑餓，也為了孩子的饑餓，不得已而偷竊了，能說是最大的罪過麽？就因為這我也憂悒了一些時候，然而不多久也又忘記了</p>
<p>「爸爸，怏來看，小阿咪在灶披間裏跳。」</p>
<p>有天早晨，四歲的孩子很快樂的吿訴我這樣的話，立刻拕着我到灶披間去。果然，兩隻小貓的一隻在笨拙的搶着娘姨手中綫繫着的紙球，阿花在旁看着，而另一隻跛脚的却一動一也不動，只是偶然間脆弱的呌一聲。阿花看見孩子的跳躍，自然有無限的快樂，可是當跛脚的一隻不能動顫，却呆呆望着牠顯出哀愁。牠用前脚扔動着牠，意思是要她站起來，隨後又自己跳躍着給他學習，可是跛脚的孩子還只是咪咪的呌，一動也不動。一次，兩决，三次，阿花心疲力竭，也只好坐在一旁，望着牠不動，就連另一孩子的跳躍，也引不起牠的興趣，一會兒，垂下尾巴悄悄的走開了。然而誰能了解道母親的哀愁呢？孩了們依舊笑樂，小貓依舊跳躍，娘姨依舊逗着，呂師母依舊笑開了　可怕的事終於在第一天發生了。阿花帶着一個孩子藏在樓上怎樣也不肯下來，不吃亦不呌喊，累得娘姨只好將臭魚拌飯送上樓去：妻吿訴我說。。阿花將那跛脚孩子在灶披間裏親口咬死了！</p>
<p>「啊？什麽時候的事？」我禁不住大為驚異起來。</p>
<p>「大槪是昨天晚上。」妻的顫抖的聲音，顯然也給感動了、接着又說：「眞是奇怪的事，天下會有這樣的貓！不過你以為這到底是憎還是愛？」</p>
<p>我沒有回答她，我只覺得阿花的行為太使人可怕。有很久一個時候我不敢忘記牠，甚至於我不願看見阿花從我身邊走過。我簡直覺得人的智　和情感，並不見得可比得上阿花的程度。</p>
<p>又是一個深　時了，黃梅天的潮濕，卽使靜寂的窗戶閉得很緊，也會覺得濃厚的雨的霧非將你悶死不可。我幾乎耐不住心情來寫文章，何况又聽見阿花在嗚嗚的呌。我聽得出這呌喊聲中含蓄着一種慈愛與焦燥的情緒，好像是母親偶然失去了兒子，而又非立刻喚回來不可。果然，我細心的靜聽，在大門外還有小阿咪的聲音，顫抖在雨的霧裏、於是很快的開了門，抱牠進來，讓牠偎在母親的胸前，阿花偎着牠濕了毛髮。議會兒，我趕着他們回到灶披間去，小阿咪一跋一跳的跟在娘的後面：原來這未死的一匹不幸的給呂師母烦踏傷了腿、不過我願望這種傷不久就會好的。第二天沒有忘記關照娘姨「再要當心，不要又給阿花咬死哩。」</p>
<p>以後，很快就將過完了夏季了，小阿咪長大了，只是脚上還是原有的創傷，免不了將是終身殘廢，然而畜生的事誰有放在心上呢？</p>
<p>偶然問起妻，她說阿花近來善良得多，我曙暗的歡喜小阿咪很是幸運；雖是殘廢，可是能留在人間不是更要緊的事嗎？同時我也這樣想：假使我是獸醫的話，我將牠的脚用夾板縛緊矯正，多給牠吃些魚肉之類的東西，使牠强壯起來，也許會好也說不一定。</p>
<p>大熱天，人們都躱在屋子裏，不敢出去，只有阿花我却看見他好幾决在天井裏晒太陽。我先是驚奇，其後我發現牠瘦骨磷磷，我才知道牠是生病了，前天，大家都嗅着天井裏有一股臭味，事夫阿二到處尋找一遍，在靠魚缸的角落裏找出了阿花快將腐爛的屍首，牠却悄悄的死了！誰又料得到呢？</p>

<h3 id="c192">讀宋哲元告冀察同胞書後 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日報上突見宋哲元發表告冀察同胞書深為訝異，我沒有發見宋先生告冀察同胞書以前，我到糊裏糊塗，沒有仔細去考慮宋先生處境的困難，和應付環境的是否事宜，及旣見宋先生告冀察同胞書，我反而有些駭異，而且疑惑起來。</p>
<p>我不知宋先生發表告冀察同胞書，究屬是怎樣的意思？是否冀察同胞，有不能原諒宋先生現在所處的態度，有所疑問，因而宋先生發表這樣的一書以自明素志呢？還是冀察以外的同胞，對於宋先生立身措施，有所不滿，因而宋先生告冀察同胞書，並以告冀察以外的同胞，俾宋先生的態度與志趣，使天下後世咸使聞知，抑宋先生於案牘勞形之餘，突然於良心上有所打擊，和不安，而並有所抱歉，故發表這樣一書聊以自解歟？故先宋生不告冀察同胞則已，一告冀察同胞，而反使冀察同胞，非冀察同胞，更要糊裏糊塗而莫名其妙也。</p>
<p>宋先生在華北所處的地位　屬困難，固我人所深知，亦更能原諒，因為宋先生假定有所主張，則宋先生在我國沒有主張之前，何怪宋先生有不能令國人瞭解而原諒者也，故我因宋先生一書，而想着胡博士曾有一書與宋先生，他的書裏，便提出五個要點：</p>
<p>第一，希望宋哲元先生，要澈底明白自己立塲，第二，希望宋哲元生明白凡是中華民國敵人，都是他的敵人，第三，希望宋哲元先生用明白的語言，向我們的友邦「鄰國」，表示他的態度，第四希望宋哲元先生，要澈底明瞭他的力量，是站在國家立塲的力量。</p>
<p>其最後一點，謂國家的立塲，是整個的，不是枝節的，一切遷就調和的行為，其用心無論如何可恕，其寶跡都是破壞國家的統一，全國人民决不能寬恕的，這篇書發表於獨立評論第二〇四期，該報的發行機關，便在北平，此文諒宋先生業已過目的了，現在宋先生所謂對外本平等互惠，謀雙方有利合作，决不作　民要權辱國的事，若照現在華北的情形看來，不知先生此語，從何說起，所以宋哲元先生愈告冀察同胞，同胞更有些疑寶愈生了。</p>
<h3 id="c193">淘沙者 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>潮水退向東邊去了。錢塘江———好似一隻平坦的磁盆。江面的海水泛着黃色，像給誰攪混了一般。對巖的青山和沙灘，給籠罩了一縷朦朧的烟幕，遠望去正像蓋覆着幾層透明的輕沙似的。</p>
<p>那些船隻啊，多半在昨夜潮水上江的時候，開向江南去了；現在剩下來的，祗是幾艘尖尾的淘沙船，散佈在江上，像夏夜的流星般，捷快地開駛着。———</p>
<p>開到王家高堡的海塘邊，時辰剛巧是正午。小根爹爹的艘，先停靠下來了。</p>
<p>小根爹爹———從艙尾裏伸出一顆頭兒來，銀絲樣的白髪，刺鬚：迎風飄動着。臉子可像個乾　的胡桃，起着上十條深深的皺紋，鼻樑高高的，隆　在二隻發着光亮的眼珠之問。他瞇着眼，向江上打量了一轉：</p>
<p>———小根！他們還上那兒去啊？你瞧瞧九公公約船兒呢？</p>
<p>隨着，舉手指着前面水道上的船隻。</p>
<p>———九公公們大槪是上七里塘一帶去的。他們眞有興，又到那邊找活貨（是魚暇之類）去呢！</p>
<p>———小根！活貨値錢啊，我們也去好吧？</p>
<p>———別去了！我想就在這塊動手打沙的。到那邊起碼趕上五六里路，怕你趕不動這多路啦！</p>
<p>小根正經着一張黑臉，懇切地勸說。</p>
<p>———哦———爹爹的呷下了一口氣，回頭望着小根：有着一身結實的肌肉的像蠻牛一般的兒子，早使他心裏滿足了。為什麽還眼熱人家呢，讓他們去找活貨也好。</p>
<p>這樣的忖着，他吭着氣，自顧爬進艙棚去，替小根把竹畚，鐵挖……搬拿出來。小根呢，上身剛赤膊了，活像一隻肥大的蛙子，正待躍下去水啊。</p>
<p>———小根！你要小心的啊！爸爸年紀大了，你第一要留心着了陷沙。</p>
<p>———爹爹，你可放心好了！</p>
<p>這裏正是在一個嚝闊的江面呢。離岸有三十多丈的相隔，淘沙吧，太深了！別的有沒水是什麽可以淘，活貨更不必說，此地渺少的。那末，父子倆口倒要計劃一下呢。</p>
<p>———小根！靠攏去吧！</p>
<p>———這裏是王家堡的柴　頭（是防塘堤潰决的堡子）呢！塘工局不是有命令「大小船隻，不准靠泊」的嗎？爹爹！這塊不許我們靠岸啊！</p>
<p>———那末！……你，你……</p>
<p>當他們正在商量的時候，老遠的，塘岸上，二個守望塘堤的警察，對他們兇獰地頂着。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>——喂！小伙子！靠攏來，——像刺蝟一樣的一個先開口了：——媽媽的！今天正給爺爺瞧見了！偷塘柴是你們兩個傢伙。靠攏來！讓十分鐘到上面去代咱白白冤！</p>
<p>另一個拉着破噪的嗓子，說了，馬下上拿肩角的洋槍，放在右手。</p>
<p>——老總爹爹！我們是淘沙的船家，我們是清白的啊！請你…</p>
<p>小根爹爹抖倒在艙板上，用盡力氣，把面孔漲得通紅，才人齒縫裏拼出些話來回答。</p>
<p>——還要賴？你騙別人去，爺爺可不能被你欺瞞的囉！</p>
<p>「有什麼法子呢」？！</p>
<p>船靠攏來了，小根這孩子，終於在喧嚷的爭奪中，小根爹爹涕淚的交流中，被他們帶走了。</p>
<p>臨去的時候，小根爹爹還受了二脚，　幾下耳光，算是看了他年老人的　　，放過他。</p>
<p>明天，江邊有人盛傳着：「淘沙的小根，昨天在王家高堡不知犯了什麼法，被塘警抓去懲辦了二年徒刑」？！</p>

<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>做妻子的，用手一揚低低的說道：「你們去吧，我什麼都很好。…」</p>
<p>做丈夫的，便和我怱怱的離開那小小的二層閣了。</p>
<p>已是秋天的季候了，街上顯得異樣的靜寂，枯黃的梧桐葉，隨了陰冷的夜風在飛跑。</p>
<p>我變得很慘淡，直到現在在自己底耳朶里，還不斷地在嗡響着那低弱而略帶幾分硬咽的說話聲，從一個十七八歲有癆病女人底口里發出的話聲。</p>
<p>三個月前，她還有一付很堅實的身子，有兩雙圓大的烏溜溜的眼珠子，用洪大而略帶幾分男音的聲音說話。可是她現在什麼都變了，變得瘦削了，　　了。…</p>
<p>在廠里，她是一朶不錯的花朶，約有十二三個年青的男工，同時在追逐着她，現在做丈夫的也是其中的一個。他有一副誠實而漂亮的面孔，身子壯健得像一匹小公牛，是一個出色的青年工人。他和她是同鄉，而且年紀也相等地，因此在那一帬為着這一朶小小花朶而涶涎的人帬中，他是佔着優勢的。</p>
<p>有一天，我沒有上工去，到了夜晚他便跑來敲我們底亭子間門，當我出來替他開門時，我禁不住給他那狼狽情形吃了一驚。他底面孔是青腫的，唇邊流着血，一隻手用手帕包着；可是，他却仍那麼快活地微笑着，面上露着亢奮而剛毅的神色。</p>
<p>「我…我和那一羣王八糕子打架…」他低聲的說着。</p>
<p>我愁悶地向他怔忡了一下：「為什麼？為吃醋？…」</p>
<p>他嚴正地用眼睛向房子底四周看了一看，好像沒聽見我說的話似的，便又默默的接下道：</p>
<p>「因為他們都欺侮她，有一個說，阿英我們開旅館去，又比著呌人難堪齷齪的手勢；有一個就索性厚起面皮，伸手去摸她底乳子，我，當時就生氣，就和他們三個人打架。」</p>
<p>「你這憨伯，大家都好好的在廠里做工，何必為着一個女人，傷了大家的和氣？…」我有點不快地用斥責的口吻說。</p>
<p>「你，你不知道…」他像生氣似的睜大了眼睛，向我看着，便默默的打開門出去了。</p>
<p>在廠里，每當上下工時，我們雖也偶有機會碰面，但大都除了互相默默的看了一眼，或揚揚手外，便又像若無其事的走開了。</p>
<p>可是，有一天他却偕着阿英一同上我們底家裏來了，兩個人都很興奮，面孔漲紅着。一進了門他便大聲的笑着道：</p>
<p>「你猜一猜榮生，我們為什麼到你這兒來？…」</p>
<p>她有點羞怯地站在桌子旁邊微笑，這使她益加變得迷人了，在這兒我才開始明白這小夥子是怎樣地為她着了迷底原故。我向他們看看，心裏雖猜出了六七分，但我仍裝傻地用不明白的口吻說道：</p>
<p>「猜不出來，是不是今晚有夜工？…」</p>
<p>他們聽着都哈哈大笑起來了，笑得那麼地響，連氣也喘不過來，終於，他們把笑面慢慢的收歛起來，低聲的說道：</p>
<p>「我們來請你吃喜酒啦，從昨天起我們同居了。…」</p>
<p>我心裏有點為他們担憂，年紀輕輕的，每月的收入又　那麼微小，只是為着一時感情的衝動住起來了，如果發生起了什麼特別意外，他們是很危險的；可是，我沒有說出，我只默默的對他們底幸福生活表示寬慰。</p>
<p>之後，他們各依照着自己底希望，生活下去了，充滿了興奮和安樂的。但是，不久陰霓便佔有了他們兩口兒底心坎了，她咳囌着，被把生意歇了。這突變在他們是來得太奇異了，她底病狀有了新的變化，跑到紅十字醫院去，醫生告訴他們是癆病。他變得沮喪而絕望了，常常就眼睛汪滿着淚水跑來找我：</p>
<p>「你，榮生替我想點辦法吧，她快要絕望了。…」</p>
<p>我心裏非常難過，我雖不能帮他什麼忙，却答應替他想法子，現在，我們就正踏着九月天黃昏的街頭，奔向希望的旅程。</p>
<p>「你年青任情，也不退一步想想…」</p>
<p>他苦痛地忙着把我底話截住，用愁苦的聲調呌道：</p>
<p>「我…做錯了。…」</p>
<p>我看看，他底眼睛氣得紅紅的。</p>

<p>— 休羊</p>
<p>——從「討債」說起</p>
<p>孩子生下地來沒有三分鐘便死了。他們說那是「落地關」一個人從生下地來到死去要經過許許多多「關煞」的，所以寶貴人家特地為孩子們鑲製了金質的「關煞開通」的飾物綴在帽子上，這樣說是可以「逢兇化吉」的。但是遇到生下地來便死去的「落地關」呢？他們只說是「討債」來的，沒有解救的方法了。</p>
<p>我已經有了一個六歲的孩子，已經入學讀書。孩子很聰明，可愛，在寂寞的時候他常常是我的先生，因為他的問話，舉動，使我喚起童年的回憶：他也是我的影子，他接受着我的倔强底性格。對這個孩子我不像普通的父母那樣寵愛，也許說是超過一般的寵愛的，我告戒他不能學習一切壞習慣，灌輸他孩子們應做的事，但是不能剝奪他的天眞——這是我從看秀蘭鄧波兒的影片得來的敎訓，這個為好萊塢商人獲得了無數利益的孩子現在，他的天眞已經被剝奪殆盡了，他像其他的「搖錢樹」一樣，祇是一個造錢的「機器」了，雖然觀眾們正是歡迎她的「若有其事」的非孩子舉動，這無異是一種殘酷的刑罰！孩子應該允許他們任性地行動，正如矛盾在「好玩的孩子」說的「博愛主義者」（未完）</p>

<p>開篇「簡神童」</p>
<p>陣陣西風吹過東。小橋堍遇見老漁翁。一日二餐常週濟。小生是。盡心極力把書攻。忽聞柴門敲三下。見火把燈籠密重重。僕婦丫環都散去。單單獨剩女姣容。莫不是。同窗好友來嘻謔。莫不是。山中妖魔逢。小姐牆。呌相公。非不是牆花路柳同。奴奴不是無名女。爹爹朝中呌馬融。貪圖富貴將奴獻。獻與梁紀作西宮。奴奴不願從奸賊。故而我。題詩一首在牆中。巧被爹爹來觀見。大發雷霆在胸中。但見那上聯是。有名自有富貴日。下聯是。富貴有日要變窮。打發總管來緝訪。緝訪分明獻相公。簡生聽。臉帶紅。想千金。何必要到苦牢籠。想小姐。在家住的高廳屋。難生是。牆倒壁坍尾漏風。小姐是在家僕婦丫環來服侍。難生是。一盞孤燈伴室中。小姐是。在家吃的山珍與海味。難生是。一日三養常落空。小姐是。在家穿的綾羅並緞匹。難生是。赤了兩肩露了胸。勸千金早早歸家轉。免在此地受苦衷。小姐聽。兩淚濃。待我撞死命歸空。免得勞人道西東。他們正在為難處。來了。雪裏送炭的老漁翁。作伐為媒佳遇逢。</p>

<p>開篇「長生殿聞鈴」</p>
<p>峨嵋山下少人經。苦雨凄風撲面迎。風流天子情難盡。龍淚紛粉泣玉人。昨日馬嵬情太慘。六軍忽地變軍心。早難道。三星難照賢妃子。刦數該遭楊太眞。而今追憶長生殿。人影衣香七夕盟。願生同羅帳死同陵。而今香魂艷魄歸何處。翠鳳靑鸞兩地分。敎就梨園歌一曲。霓裳從此絕知音。沉香亭有誰與我奏淸平。陳元禮。很無情。陽奉陰違違朕身。以致於祿山兵變范陽城。從今一別難相見。要見賢妃。只好見白綾。力士開箱與我取白綾。見綾如見賢妃面。妃子吓。並不是。江山情重美人輕。高力士。啟聖君。楊娘娘已死豈能生。請加鞭躦趕羊腸道。劍閣聞鈴幾斷魂。杜鵑風雨夜三更。</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The news of the Shanghai incident spread here like adding oil to fire. Current developments seem to have reached the most serious stage. After an all-night meeting, the Naval Ministry issued important instructions this morning to Oikawa, the commander of the Third Fleet stationed in China, ordering the naval marines stationed in China to take responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents in China. At the same time, they have made various preparations. If the situation deteriorates, reinforcements will be dispatched immediately. Naval Minister Nagano has cancelled his plan to attend the army's large-scale military exercise. The army authorities believe that the implementation of the fundamental and final plan is now approaching. It is also rumored that Ambassador Kawagoe will stay in Nanjing to hold direct negotiations with President Chiang after he returns to Nanjing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the recent murder of Japanese First Class Seaman Tagang and the wounding of two other sailors in Shanghai, the atmosphere among officials here is extremely tense. Given the urgency of the situation, some officials from the Naval Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters remained in the Naval Ministry, awaiting detailed information on the case until late at night before dispersing. It is reported that the Japanese naval authorities have scheduled a meeting this morning to discuss the policies and urgent measures to be taken regarding this case. It is also said that officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also hold a meeting this morning. According to well-informed sources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will cooperate closely with the Naval Ministry in taking concrete measures. It is also said that the army will back the hard-line policy proposed by the navy. As for the content of this policy, major decisions must be made in the three-minister conference of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy. At the same time, Naval Minister Nagano has cancelled his plans to leave Tokyo, saying, "The situation is so serious that I fear I will not be able to attend the Emperor in Hokkaido."

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently discussing with the naval authorities methods to protect Japanese residents in various parts of China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now decided on a policy of engaging in protection in the areas where Japanese residents reside and intends to issue orders to consuls stationed in China within the next few days. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The official report from the Shanghai General Consulate regarding the shooting of a Japanese sailor in Shanghai arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs late on the 23rd.

<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita has instructed Kawagoe, the current Japanese ambassador to China, to wait for President Chiang to return to Nanjing before negotiating with the Chinese government to resolve recent Sino-Japanese incidents and adjust relations between the two countries. Kawagoe will stay in Nanjing while President Chiang has not yet returned to Nanjing from Guangdong. Senior officials from the foreign, army, and navy ministries held an important meeting this afternoon. It is reported that they unanimously resolved to urge the Chinese government to make even greater efforts to curb anti-Japanese sentiment and to negotiate the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters that the situation is very serious. The Japanese government, in light of the strengthening of anti-Japanese movements by terrorist groups in China, held a meeting because it feels that the time has come for the Chinese government to clearly express its willingness to maintain friendly relations with Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Naval Attaché Sato arrived in Nanjing by plane at 8:30 this morning. Starting at 10:00, Ambassador Kawagoe was at the center of a meeting at the embassy.

Army Attaché Kita and Nanjing Consul General Suma were also present, and they had a long discussion. In the afternoon, Sato and Kawagoe continued their meeting until 5:00 PM.

<h3 id="e7">British and American Figures Closely Monitoring <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers are paying close attention to the shooting of a Japanese sailor in the Hongkou area of Shanghai last night. Many are using dispatches from Shanghai as their main news. However, no critical articles have been published in the editorial sections of the newspapers. According to information obtained by Reuters, officials here are closely monitoring the situation but refuse to express their opinions and are awaiting further information. The opinions of people in London on this matter can be summarized as "extremely regrettable and disturbing," and they hope that the progress of Sino-Japanese compromise will not be seriously affected as a result, as people on both sides desire. Well-informed sources have pointed out that the Chinese government's efforts to ban anti-Japanese demonstrations were most evident during the 9/18 anniversary. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here are very concerned about the recent situation between China and Japan and are paying attention to its development. It is generally believed that Japan's adoption of a tough stance is a prelude to proposing new conditions. Moreover, given that Japan consistently takes advantage of major international events to carry out aggression against China, it is not surprising that Japan is taking action while the world's attention is focused on Europe since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.

<p>(Nanjing) The initial election candidates for the National Assembly have not been nominated by some provinces and cities as scheduled, so the central government has not been able to finalize and return the list within the deadline, which has led to rumors outside that the Assembly will be postponed. According to reliable sources, the failure to complete the initial election as scheduled is due to various practical difficulties. There is still a month and a half before the Assembly, and all procedures can still be completed. As for the different situations in Hebei and Chahar provinces, discussions are currently underway, and a solution will be found to allow representatives to participate in the future. Based on the above, the Assembly can proceed as scheduled. The rumors outside are nothing more than speculation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Election Headquarters responded to inquiries from the Nanjing Election Supervisory Office regarding the eligibility of military officers to participate in the election, stating that the "officers and soldiers" mentioned in Article 40 of the Election Law are a general term and there is no distinction between military personnel and military officers. Therefore, military officers should participate in military elections in accordance with the law. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Britain's New Offensive in the Mediterranean <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— Period</p>
<p>The focus of international politics these days has shifted to the Palace of Peace on the shores of Lake Geneva. The issue of Abyssinia's eligibility to attend the League of Nations is the focus of international attention. But we must not forget that Italy's annexation of Abyssinia not only dealt an unprecedented blow to the League of Nations, but also sharpened the conflict between British and Italian forces in the Mediterranean. This sharp conflict has not been eased by the lifting of sanctions against Italy. On the contrary, the recent struggle between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean is proceeding at an even faster pace. It is true that Britain's recent counter-offensive is most evident.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the British Empire wants to take a counter-offensive stance against Italy in the Mediterranean. On the one hand, Italy's annexation of Abyssinia has greatly weakened Britain's position in the eastern Mediterranean. On the other hand, the growing strength of the Spanish rebels has threatened Britain's position in the western Mediterranean, especially the security of Gibraltar, the gateway to the West. The substantial assistance given to the Spanish rebels by the two major fascist countries of Italy and Germany has long been an open secret. If the rebels are able to seize power in Madrid, then Spanish Morocco and the Balearic Islands will become Italian territories. In this way, the sea lane that has always been the lifeline of the British Empire is in danger of being cut off by Italy at any time. Therefore, under such severe pressure from the Blackshirt Prime Minister, Britain has no choice but to adopt a new counter-offensive stance.</p>
<p>Regarding Britain's new counter-offensive stance against Italy in the Mediterranean, we can cite several important recent facts as evidence. The first is the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian alliance treaty on July 26th. The main purpose of this treaty is to allow Egypt's complete independence on the surface, in order to ease the anti-British movement in Egypt, while at the same time making Egypt listen to Britain's command in the event of war or threat, and jointly attack their common enemy. The second is the recent Mediterranean tour of King Edward VIII of England and his visits to the heads of state of the Balkan countries. The fact that the King's trip has major political significance is self-evident. The Roman Stampaba newspaper pointed out in its commentary on the 19th, "When the King was in Yugoslavia, he carefully examined the Dalmatian region (on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea) in order to clarify whether the coast, which could have been used as a trap for naval fleets, could be converted into a base for attacking Italy. In Greece, he wanted to induce the dictator to abide by the old traditional policy and allow the British Navy to do whatever it wanted. In Istanbul, Turkey, its political role is particularly evident. The green British prestige, which had greatly declined after the Italian-Abyssinian War, must be restored." Although this commentary in the Italian newspaper inevitably contains subjective colors, the facts have now proven that Britain and Turkey will hold a meeting in London next month to sign the Mediterranean Agreement to resist the eastward encroachment of Italian forces. Furthermore, Sir Hol, the British Minister of the Navy, cruised the Mediterranean, inspected various naval bases and fleets, and issued an official statement after returning to London on the 22nd, saying that "Britain not only has no intention of abandoning its position in the Mediterranean, but also intends to find ways to deal with the various difficult issues that have recently arisen, so that Britain's position will be safer in the future." Is this not the clearest confession of a counter-attack against Italian oppression?</p>
<p>In addition, such as the British Aviation Chief Shawson's flight to Egypt, a visit to the Royal Air Force base in Sudan, part of the British fleet cruised the eastern Mediterranean, and the dispatch of a large number of troops to Palestine to suppress the anti-British movement of Arabs, can be said to be the new stance of Britain's counter-offensive against Italian oppression. Observing this situation, while the peaceful diplomatic battle on the shores of Lake Geneva should be noted, the new struggle between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean should not be ignored.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 10:00 AM on the 4th, the Heguangsi barracks summoned all 30-plus members of the military staff, including Hashimoto, Iida, Ikeda, Wachi, and Asai, for a meeting on the Fengtai incident, which ended at 11:00 AM.

(Domei News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Huang Jie, the commander of the Xuhai Garrison, arrived in Xuzhou from Haizhou on the evening of the 23rd. On the morning of the 24th, he summoned officers and soldiers of the Second Division at the Jiulishan training ground to give instructions and scheduled to inspect the city's trained citizens at Yunlong Mountain on the morning of the 25th.

<h3 id="e15">New Witnesses and Evidence Discovered in the Yoshioka Incident, Proving That the Body Was Never Moved, Which Also Matches the Confessions of the Stallholders <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) After the Norwegian expatriate Captain and Mrs. George Strong of the Mobil Oil tanker clarified that Yoshioka's body had not been moved and that it was impossible for the assassin to escape from Hejie to the Chinese area, the Chinese side discovered a new witness who proved that Yoshioka was definitely not assassinated in front of the cigarette stand pointed out by the Japanese side. The witness happened to be standing by the river looking out towards the river. After hearing the gunshot, he immediately turned around and saw two stallholders, an older man standing and a younger man sitting, with no other situation. However, the witness's view was blocked by the corner of the Mobil Oil warehouse wall, so he could not see the police post. Therefore, the Japanese police officer was not aware of the assassination at the time and did not pay attention because he thought the gunshot was a tire exploding. This testimony is consistent with the descriptions of Captain and Mrs. George Strong, the first confession of Huang Qingyun detained by the Japanese side (obtained at the 13th Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau), and the second confession of stallholder Liu Xiya (obtained during the joint interrogation by the Chinese and Japanese sides), proving that it was absolutely impossible to move the body. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Today's Western newspapers revealed the details of the meeting between Japanese Consul Miura and Yang Yongtai, stating that Miura demanded that the Chinese authorities take full responsibility for the Yoshioka incident and immediately arrest the murderer. Yang replied that the Chinese authorities were very willing to assist in arresting the murderer in a friendly manner, but could not take responsibility for incidents that occurred within the concession, and said that the Yoshioka case was an ordinary criminal matter and did not clearly have any political implications. Currently, the point of contention in this case is still the place where Yoshioka died. At the time of the incident, two Norwegians witnessed Yoshioka falling next to the police post, definitely within the Japanese concession. One of these two Norwegians was the wife of a certain captain, and one had informed the Japanese police station by telephone. Afterwards, they both swore and signed a certificate of proof before Consul Mark of the Norwegian Consulate. It can be seen that this should be used as the best clue to investigate this case. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese warships Wutake and Setta hurriedly went to Shanghai this morning, carrying more than 200 marines. Currently, the five ships Atago, Atami, Futami, and Renmu are anchored in the Han River. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese newspapers here reported that Yoshioka's family left Nagasaki on the 23rd to come to Hankou. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Negotiations over the assassination of Japanese Consulate Police Officer Yoshioka last Saturday and Sunday continue to be deadlocked. Chinese authorities told Reuters reporters today that, given the recent tensions in Sino-Japanese relations, they are eager to do everything possible to assist the Japanese side in investigating the case and have no intention of obstructing it in any way. However, one thing is most important, and that is that there must be a clearer understanding of the case before taking any drastic action. Although Yoshioka was murdered within the Japanese concession, the murderer in this case, regardless of his nationality, is an enemy of China. Therefore, the Chinese side is extremely willing to provide assistance to Japan within the scope possible. Japanese Consul General Miura told Reuters reporters that there were no major developments in the case today. However, in his opinion, the recent events in Shanghai have made the situation extremely serious and may affect the resolution of the Hankou case. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After Norwegian George Strong's wife testified that Yoshioka's body had not been moved, Japanese newspapers criticized that the Chinese side was only seeking witnesses that were beneficial to themselves and had no sincerity. We believe that whoever committed this matter, whether Chinese or non-Chinese, is an enemy of both China and Japan. Although this case occurred within the Japanese concession, the Chinese side is willing to assist in arresting the murderer and hopes to solve the case as soon as possible. However, in order to arrest the murderer and solve the case, we must thoroughly understand the circumstances of the incident at the time. The testimonies of the four Chinese witnesses currently detained by the Japanese side have many suspicions. One of them is a child under ten years old, and two are old men over seventy years old. Moreover, the confession of one of them in the Chinese Public Security Bureau is different from the confession after being detained in the Japanese police station, and the confessions of the child are inconsistent. Therefore, the Chinese authorities are now searching for eyewitnesses in various ways in order to understand the circumstances of the incident and have no other intentions. Moreover, the Chinese side has already jointly interrogated the witnesses obtained by the Japanese side, and although the witnesses discovered by the Chinese side have repeatedly notified the Japanese side for joint interrogation, the Japanese side has not yet processed them. We hope that the Japanese side will cooperate sincerely. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Investigation of the Beihai Incident Completes Preliminary Work, Nakano's Body Cremated After Examination, Ling Shifen Prepares to Return to Province to Report <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ling Shifen landed in Beihai on the morning of the 23rd together with Japanese investigators, a total of eight people from both sides, to investigate the Maruichi store opened by Nakano and examine the body. Nakano's children were taken back to the Saga warship by the Japanese side, and his wife remained in Beihai. The Japanese transmission that his wife went to Shanghai is inaccurate. Our investigation has already yielded results. After Ling returns to the province and makes a comprehensive decision, it will be released. Ling Shifen is scheduled to leave Beihai on the 26th and return to the province. At that time, Diao Zuqian will send the entire case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the Chinese and Japanese investigators investigating the Beihai incident completed preliminary work on the 23rd. The first report has arrived at the Two Guangdong Special Commissioner's Office. Details will be reported in person after Ling Shifen returns to Guangdong. Several Japanese warships that arrived in Beihai left Beihai on the evening of the 23rd. It is not known whether they were ordered to be transferred or to sail to the outer sea. Diao Zuqian and Huang Musong sent telegrams to Nanjing one after another on the 24th. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Domei News Agency) At 8:00 AM on the 23rd, a group of Japanese investigators on the 〇〇 warship anchored in front of Beihai contacted the Chinese committee. At 8:30, consular officials and the Chinese investigators went ashore at the same time. From 9:00, under the guidance of the Beihai Port Director Spencer and escorted by seven military policemen, they first investigated Mr. Nakano's residence and confirmed that the remains had been buried in the cemetery. Then they went to the cemetery together, opened the coffin and examined the body. Mr. Nakano was still wearing Western clothes and was quite decayed. After careful examination, it was confirmed that it was indeed him. The fatal wound was a shattered right clavicle, and there were eight other wounds in the right abdomen. During the excavation, there was a sudden downpour, and suddenly two women cried and arrived. After questioning, it was learned that they were Nakano's surviving relatives, his wife and adopted daughter (13). Then his eldest son, Qingjun (17), also rushed from the municipal government. The group then accompanied the three surviving relatives to the warship. The remains will be cremated tomorrow. Then, based on the testimony of third parties, the investigation will continue, and Nakano's inheritance will be investigated, and his surviving relatives will be dealt with. According to the surviving relatives, the 80 criminals broke into the upstairs, and five of them stabbed Nakano with short knives. (24th)</p>
<p>(Domei News Agency) Secretary Tonemoki returned to the warship from the first on-site investigation and said that the Chinese side announced martial law in the Beihai area. Under martial law, the investigation was completed. Mr. Nakano's surviving relatives seemed to have fled to the countryside after the incident. People nearby advised them to come to the city because Japanese warships had arrived. (24th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Suga, the naval attaché stationed in Fujian, was ordered to go to Beihai. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Ling Shifen landed on the morning of the 23rd together with the Japanese investigators to conduct an investigation. They visited the Maruichi Foreign Company shop established by Nakano for three hours and went to Nakano's grave together to examine the body. Nakano's wife and children were all present. After Ling and others finished the examination, they met with Xu Rangxuan, the chief of staff of the 159th Division. Nakano's body was cremated at noon that day. Ling boarded the ship again on the evening of the 23rd to meet with Chief of Staff Xu and decided to land again on the 24th for a detailed investigation. Nakano's son and daughter, one each, were taken by the investigators onto the Japanese warship. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Talks by Weng Wenhao: Recent Developments in Sino-Japanese Diplomacy and Local Administration; University Student Training Program Scheduled to Start in September <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding recent Sino-Japanese diplomacy, the central government's reforms to local administration, and the progress of the university student training program, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Weng Wenhao on the 24th to inquire about his views. According to his account, with regard to recent issues between China and Japan, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe repeatedly discussed and exchanged views with Foreign Minister Zhang, expressing his opinions frankly and sincerely regarding the general adjustment of diplomatic relations, in addition to explaining the solutions considered by the Chinese government. Although no concrete solutions have been agreed upon, it is believed that both China and Japan will adopt an impartial attitude to clarify the general issues. The Executive Yuan has been very proactive this year in researching and reforming local administration, aiming to determine, enrich, and improve the organization of counties, the powers of administrative commissioners, and local security within a short period. The Chairman's headquarters has introduced many innovations for the reform of local systems, such as the joint office of the provincial government, the establishment of supervisory commissioners, the restructuring of county governments by replacing bureaus with sections, and the establishment of public offices, which have proven effective in implementation. However, because the scope is limited to bandit suppression areas and there are still many issues that need to be improved, the Executive Yuan convened a conference of commissioners in May to discuss the actual situation of local administration, aiming to promote benefits and eliminate drawbacks. After the conference, the Premier immediately assigned two counselors, Zhang and Wu, to visit Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi to inspect the situation, with very satisfactory results. Politics in various regions have shifted from passive to active, but there are still many areas that need improvement. The Executive Yuan has also assigned personnel to study the joint office of the provincial government, the organization of administrative commissioners, the establishment of sub-regional offices, the preservation of armor and grain, and security, in order to find effective reform methods. Once compiled, these methods will be implemented. Subsequently, local administrative inspectors will be dispatched to various regions to inspect local political institutions and the national economy. Weng mentioned that the enrollment of students for the training program for graduates of specialized schools and universities has been completed, and the situation is very good. The qualification review is based on a common and appropriate percentage of the number of graduates from each school in the most recent three years, calculating the number of places each school can enroll. If the number of recommended students exceeds the quota, those with lower academic performance will be eliminated. This allows for an assessment of the quality of each school's management. Overall, the review results show that the percentage of students in science and engineering is the lowest, while the liberal arts are more numerous, indicating a lack of practical talent in China. All preparations for the training program have been completed, and it is scheduled to begin in September. After the training, graduates will be assigned for internships and employment. The location of assignment has not yet been determined. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>(New York) Republican presidential candidate Alf Landon published an article in the New York Herald Tribune today, criticizing Roosevelt's New Deal and foreign policy without reservation. He stated that the New Deal was wasteful, the government's economic policy was corrupt, and the United States could not sustain itself without international trade or foreign responsibility while insisting on an economically self-sufficient policy. President Roosevelt's withdrawal from the 1933 London Economic Conference was a serious mistake, which dealt a blow to peace. He solemnly declared that the United States should advocate the practical resolution of all international disputes through arbitration and negotiation. (23rd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hyde Park, USA) President Roosevelt delivered a radio address to the open debate of the New York Herald Tribune today, requesting that the entire country be logical and unbiased when campaigning for the election. The President hoped that all points of contention concerning the future of the country would be resolved in a calm and rational manner, rather than through exaggeration and abuse. Some say the government is restricting freedom of speech, to which the President replied that American newspapers have always been good at attacking the government without any restrictions, demonstrating that freedom of speech in the United States has not been restricted.

<h3 id="e32">China Obtains Council Seat in League of Nations; Committee of League of Nations Passes Resolution; Gu Weijun Speaks on China's Position; Executive Council to Increase to Fifteen Members <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The First Committee of the League of Nations, namely the Legal and Regulatory Committee, held a public meeting this morning, chaired by the Dutch representative Limburg, to discuss the organization of the Executive Council.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Canada, Spain, France, Iran, Italy, Peru, Poland, Sweden, the Soviet Union, and China had previously formed a committee on the allocation of Executive Council seats to conduct research. In April of this year, they resolved to make a recommendation to the General Assembly that the organization of the Executive Council should be changed. The non-permanent council seat previously obtained by Portugal in 1933 should also be maintained after its term expires this year. At the same time, an additional seat should be added for China, increasing the number of Executive Council members from fourteen to fifteen.</p>
<p>At today's meeting of the Legal and Regulatory Committee, the Norwegian representative expressed dissatisfaction with the current organization of the Executive Council, stating that the countries of South America occupied three seats on the Executive Council (namely Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina), which was too many, and that the number of Executive Council members was constantly increasing, and that in a few years, their number would be equal to that of the League of Nations General Assembly. In addition, Chile, Argentina, and Venezuela supported the proposal to change the organization of the Executive Council. As for the various proposals to amend the League Covenant, the committee decided to postpone further discussion until the next General Assembly. (24th Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese representative, Dr. Gu Weijun, the country's ambassador to France, gave a speech on the country's request for a council seat, stating that since 1934, there had been no representative of an Asian country on the Executive Council, but the Executive Council should be all-encompassing, and events occurring in Asia could affect the entire world, and the Executive Council would benefit from directly obtaining information. "China has a vast territory and abundant resources," and its population is the largest in the world. Its cooperation with the League of Nations has been extremely close from the beginning, and it is very appropriate to represent Asia.</p>
<p>The representatives of Chile, Caballer, Iran, Atle, Siam, Vatravandi, Turkey, Sadok, and Iraq, Nuri, all supported China's request. The First Committee then passed a resolution proposing to the League of Nations General Assembly that the number of non-permanent Executive Council members be increased from nine to eleven, one of which would be given to China, and one would be retained by Portugal.

<h3 id="e33">League of Nations General Assembly Passes Resolution Allowing Abyssinia to Continue Attendance; Case Submitted to World Court Dismissed <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Credentials Committee of the League of Nations decided today that the Abyssinian delegation may continue to attend and enjoy the rights of a member state. It is generally believed that Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations is likely unavoidable.</p>
<p>The Credentials Committee convened several meetings today. In addition to the above decision, it also decided that the credentials of the Abyssinian delegation were legitimate and should not be requested for adjudication by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, because since the Abyssinian representatives had been permitted to attend the General Assembly temporarily, requesting a ruling from the Hague Court would only further complicate the issue. The report of the Credentials Committee allowing the Abyssinian representatives to attend the League of Nations General Assembly was subsequently passed by the General Assembly with a majority of 39 votes to 4. Six countries abstained from the vote. When the Greek representative Politis handed the Credentials Committee report to the Abyssinian representative Taezaz, Taezaz expressed his gratitude upon receiving it. Subsequently, the Hungarian representative suddenly rose and questioned Abyssinia's right to attend, shocking the entire assembly. Representatives from Albania and Australia also supported Hungary's opinion.</p>
<p>The Swiss representative Motta said he would not participate in the vote because the issue of the legitimacy of the Abyssinian delegation's credentials still existed and its political implications were significant.</p>
<p>The votes in favor were from the United Kingdom, France, the Little Entente, and the Balkan Alliance countries, as well as the British Dominions. The votes against were from Hungary, Austria, Albania, and Ecuador. The countries that abstained were Bulgaria, Chile, Siam, Switzerland, Portugal, and Venezuela.</p>
<p>The Credentials Committee's action is only valid for the current session. The Committee's decision to oppose appealing to the Hague International Court of Justice is because the Hague International Court of Justice cannot make any ruling before the League of Nations General Assembly closes. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting, the reporter of the Credentials Committee, the Greek representative Politis, first read the report of the committee. The Abyssinian youth representative, Taezaz, immediately stood up and expressed his thanks to the Credentials Committee in a few words. The Hungarian representative, General Thomazos, then proposed that the General Assembly vote on the matter by roll call. The representatives of Austria and Albania seconded the proposal. The Swiss representative, Mutta, expressed the opinion that "whether Abyssinia can attend the General Assembly is not merely a procedural issue. The Credentials Committee's decision not to submit this issue to the Hague Permanent Court of International Justice is indeed wise. However, the question of whether the Abyssinian representatives' qualifications are valid still exists and will inevitably have extremely important political consequences. Therefore, Switzerland intends to abstain from voting."</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Credentials Committee, the Peruvian representative Tudela, immediately stood up to reply, saying that the issue of the Abyssinian representatives' qualifications, as far as the present is concerned, is purely a procedural issue, and that what the Credentials Committee can deal with is also limited to procedural issues. At that point, the Chairman of the General Assembly, the Argentinian Foreign Minister Lamas, used a roll call method to put the matter to a vote. It was estimated that a total of 49 member states of the League of Nations attended today's General Assembly. According to Article 5 of the League of Nations Covenant, matters concerning the procedures of the General Assembly are valid if passed by a majority. Therefore, the Abyssinian delegation obtained the right to attend the current General Assembly. It was already 8:15 PM, and the General Assembly was adjourned until 10:00 AM the next day. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Credentials Committee of the League of Nations General Assembly completed the review of the Abyssinian representatives' qualifications at 5:50 PM. The committee's review report was immediately issued. The report advocated allowing the Abyssinian representatives to attend the current General Assembly, but it clearly stated that this decision did not affect Abyssinia's legal status. As for the matter of seeking advice from the Hague Permanent Court of International Justice, the committee believed that there were practical inconveniences in fact, because, on the one hand, the International Court of Justice could not issue an advisory opinion until several weeks later, and, on the other hand, the issue of whether to allow Abyssinian representatives to appear in court to defend themselves would still arise when the International Court of Justice opened the court. However, the report did not mention what international repercussions this decision would have. When the report was issued, a large crowd gathered outside the hotel where the Abyssinian Emperor was staying, and the public gallery was also extremely crowded when the League of Nations General Assembly voted on the report.

<h3 id="e34">Italy Indignant, Will Consider Withdrawing from the League <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The entire country of Italy is indignant upon hearing that the League of Nations has allowed the Abyssinian representatives to continue to attend the General Assembly. The Italians are very surprised by the League of Nations' decision, believing that this is tantamount to indicating that Italy's return to the League of Nations will be delayed indefinitely. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally withdraw from the League of Nations, and Italy's participation in the Locarno Conference of five countries, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy, is therefore even more questionable. If Italy decides to withdraw from the League of Nations, it will have to wait until the cabinet meeting is held on October 10 to discuss the issue before it can be announced. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures here continue to adopt an alienated attitude towards Geneva. It is said that the recent League of Nations General Assembly's approval of the Abyssinian representatives' attendance has made it impossible for Italy to change its original decision, which is that Italy will not participate in the League of Nations and other international conferences until the Abyssinian issue is resolved one day. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Unofficial predictions here are that Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations because of the General Assembly's vote to allow Abyssinian representatives to continue to attend. However, officials have not yet confirmed this, only saying that the League of Nations' decision has created a serious situation. Diplomatic circles believe that Italy will still refuse to attend League of Nations meetings without formally withdrawing, pending a solution to the Abyssinian issue. Prime Minister Mussolini is also unwilling to "burn the bridges behind him," but the Locarno Five-Power Conference will be greatly affected. (23rd National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations allowed the representatives of Abyssinia to attend the General Assembly, the Emperor of that country recently issued a written statement to the press, stating that the country's claims had been victorious and that it should express its gratitude to the General Assembly, but "the Abyssinian delegation cannot but make reservations about certain reasons stated in the report of the Credentials Committee, because these reasons are actually in conflict with the principle of not recognizing the occupation of land by force," and so on.

<p>(London) According to the opinions of general observers, the League of Nations General Assembly's decision to allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend will make it impossible to convene the Locarno Five-Power Conference, because Italy may not attend the Five-Power Conference as a result. Observers also believe that Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations. At least during the period when the Abyssinian representatives continue to attend the League of Nations meetings, Italy will inevitably refuse to participate in various international negotiations. As for the note sent by the British government to the governments of France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy on the 18th of this month regarding the convening of the Five-Power Conference, Germany's reply has not yet been received. Presumably, German leader Hitler will express his attitude after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has replied. According to well-informed sources, the British note did not propose a separate West European Sky Treaty outside the New Locarno Treaty, but only suggested that security guarantees should be extended to the sky and land. In addition, the British note proposed that the mutual aid structure should be applied only after the decision of the League of Nations Executive Council. Therefore, some members of the British Parliament believe that this proposal may not satisfy Berlin, because Germany has decided that it does not want to be involved in Geneva. Due to the above-mentioned obstacles, the Five-Power Conference seems to have little hope of establishing an agreement. Political figures believe that the only remedy is to expand the Anglo-French-Belgian Mutual Guarantee Agreement signed on April 1 of this year. (23rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Madrid – Government troops yesterday completed the deployment of their defensive lines in the area of ​​Villaverde and San Sebastián de los Reyes south of the capital. The rebel army does not intend to launch an immediate offensive, but will wait for reinforcements to arrive from the rear before launching a fierce attack. Government troops will certainly be able to carefully plan their defense and resistance, and fight a fierce battle with the enemy. As for the situation in the city of Toledo, the situation of the National Army is no different from yesterday. The area near the Alcázar in the city, which was occupied by government troops yesterday, is now passable. In addition, a local radio station broadcast a message saying that government aircraft flew to the port of Ferrol in the northwest yesterday, destroying many buildings in the port and destroying a train carrying a large amount of ammunition, all of which was intended to supply the National Army in the Villaverde area south of the capital. In addition, according to news from Barcelona, ​​Colonel Sandino, the director of the military department of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, declared yesterday that government troops had made great progress towards the city of Huesca and occupied the strategically important city of Gasa outside the city, capturing a tank loaded with grain. According to the "La Noche" newspaper, the government has established a new divorce court and formulated new laws, reducing the conditions for divorce by mutual agreement to a minimum. Therefore, in two days, it has accepted more than 300 divorce cases, of which 17 have been adjudicated. This is also an anecdote in the midst of the sounds of war drums. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar – The position of the left-wing government in Madrid is becoming increasingly critical today. Britain has stopped remitting payments to Spain and its territories today.

(2) Defeat the army surrounding the Alcázar to rescue the right-wing cadets who have been trapped for six weeks. (3) Advance northeast, cutting off traffic from Madrid to Valencia. (4) Attack Madrid simultaneously from the northwest, northeast, and south. At the same time, the left-wing army also announced the following plan: (1) Occupy the Alcázar. (2) If it cannot be occupied, the army surrounding the fortress will try to retreat.

<p>Madrid – The siege of the historically famous Moorish fortress of Alcázar in Toledo ended today after a long period. Government troops have occupied the remaining fortresses. The fortress has been under siege for nine weeks. Although the rebel army was in a desperate situation, they fought to the death and used a small force to resist the masses. They were able to make government troops gain every inch of land only at a great cost. At dawn today, a stormtrooper of 400 government troops began to attack. The remaining rebel army in the fortress still occupied the dining room and kitchen as their final stand. Due to the disparity in numbers, they were finally exhausted and surrendered. Therefore, the fortress changed hands and fell into the hands of government troops. Spanish Prime Minister Caballero has set off for Toledo to reward the government troops who attacked the fortress. During the nine weeks that the fortress was under siege, for several weeks, the garrison only had one meal a day, consisting of a piece of horse meat and a small amount of bread. Among them, officer cadets and aristocratic children shared the hardships with the soldiers. The situation inside the fortress was very terrifying. Rotten corpses were everywhere. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid – According to a communique released by the government, government troops in Toledo completely occupied the Alcázar fortress this morning. Prime Minister Caballero has rushed to the city of Toledo to congratulate the government troops.

<p>Burgos – General Mola, commander-in-chief of the Northern Route National Army, recently gave a speech to the press, explaining the theory advocated by the National Army. He said, "The Spanish nation is organized by various disparate factors. If we want to unite, we must have considerable authority. According to this, only the army can rule everything. The reason why the organization of the National Army government is based on various generals is because of this." Then he spoke about the organization of the military government, saying, "The military government is composed of a meeting of commanders from various routes, such as General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Southern Route, General Davila, a member of the military government, General Fonder, General Yagüe, commander of the troops stationed in the Moroccan territory, General Deriano, commander of the Andalusian division, and myself (General Mola referring to himself) all participate, and the military government chairman, General Cabanellas, presides over it. As for other administrative matters, there are several directors in charge, who are responsible for (1) commerce, (2) public works, (3) finance, (4) justice, and (5) propaganda. Among them, the director of justice is responsible for selecting judges and restoring civil courts. Criminal cases are still handled by military courts. As for propaganda matters, they are handled by Mr. Puijol, a former Madrid congressman who was a journalist, and he also publishes the "Gazette of the National Military Government".

<p>(London) Rumors that the French cabinet will change soon, and news that Mr. Caillaux Renaud, who advocates lowering the value of the currency, suddenly returned to Paris from New York, caused the price of gold coins converted into pounds to continue to weaken this morning. The spot franc price fell to 77.00, and was maintained by the British Funds, and then returned to 76.98. The forward franc price fell even more, which reflects the weakness of the franc's position. Some believe that the reason for this is that the Dutch currency is based on the franc. The Dutch bank is afraid that the franc will collapse, so it sells a large number of forward francs and buys long-term US dollars. The forward US dollar has recently increased in premium converted into pounds, which is probably the reason for this. Although the Bank of France has lost as much as 4.5 million pounds of gold in the past few days, traders in the foreign exchange market are still skeptical about the rumors that France will implement a gold export ban, but it is generally recognized that this move will be realized sooner or later. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) There are many rumors here today that the government is about to control finance and that the devaluation of the franc is imminent. The rumors are caused by the outflow of cash. Another 12,455,000 yuan was shipped to New York today. Since August 7, the outflow of gold reserves has increased to 134,600,000 yuan. The Bank of France's cash reserves are now reduced to about 51,000,000,000 francs. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Financial figures here feel that something will happen soon in view of the continued flight of cash due to fear of the franc's devaluation. It is heard that in the past five days, the cash exported has reached as much as 9 million pounds. Officials believe that the current situation is no different from before. The government will temporarily prevent the devaluation of the franc to see if an international monetary agreement will be produced in the crowded proposals in Geneva. If there is no result, French Prime Minister Blum is afraid that he will eventually have to take urgent action. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>Special Dispatch from Alliance News Agency, Vienna – Yulikander, a well-known dwarf from Vienna, is 45 years old and 3 feet 6 inches tall. He owns a store in Vienna that specializes in selling or manufacturing clothing and furniture for dwarves. He makes a lot of profit every year. His scale is gradually expanding. He is increasingly in contact with dwarves scattered all over the world, either becoming confidants through letters or meeting directly for purchases. To date, more than 56,000 dwarves worldwide have been in contact with Kander. Mr. Kander is very angry that dwarves are often ridiculed by the world. He plans to build a dwarf country and gather dwarves from all over the world to live in one place. He decided to convene a world dwarf representative conference in Budapest in the coming days to discuss this matter. He has sent out invitations to 56,000 dwarves around the world.

<p>(Nanjing) After arriving in Shanghai from You Lie’s free port, he rested in Shanghai due to his old age and fatigue from the sea voyage. Now that his spirits have recovered, he and his attendants and grandson arrived in Beijing by night train from Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. Many important figures in the central government came to the station to welcome him. After getting off the train, You went to the hotel to rest. He planned to visit the tomb of the Premier and visit old friends in Beijing within the next few days. When the reporter went to visit You, he was honored to publish a written conversation as follows: Nanjing is the capital set by Sun Premier. I have not traveled here for more than ten years. This time, I came to visit the Premier's tomb and visit old comrades and comrades. My feelings about the current national situation are one of joy and one of fear. The central leaders can bury their heads in hard work, work together in harmony, and cultivate national power. The local officials can also understand the central government and do their best to unite, so as to achieve the true peace and unification of the country. Whether the party has been in revolution for decades, today it has obtained the Republic of China that is worthy of its name. It is indeed gratifying. However, from the perspective of the environment surrounding our country, disasters are coming one after another, just like a child who has just recovered from leprosy sitting on brambles, with snakes, wolves, tigers, and leopards in front and behind. It is frightening. According to reports, You is one of the so-called four great thieves in the early days of the Chinese revolution and is now 72 years old. (Central News Agency, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e75">Prelude to North China's Economic Exploitation: Japanese Plan to Dominate North China's Electric Power Industry; Two Companies, Toyo and Osaka, Establish Paper Mills <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The electric power project of the Xingzhong Company in North China aims to achieve domination based on the tactics of the Manchuria Electric Power Company. The Manchuria Electric Power Company's capital was increased to 50 million yuan. All public matters related to electricity, telephone, and streetcars in the four northeastern provinces, whether government-run or private, were bought up, and it has now achieved its goal of domination. Its ambition for the North China electricity industry is no less than its ambition in the Northeast, but it is afraid that its actions will easily attract attention, so it is using the Xingzhong Company as a front, while the Manchuria Electric Power Company is still responsible for the capital burden. In addition to the establishment of the Sino-Japanese joint venture Electric Power Joint Stock Company in Tianjin, it has recently also acquired the electric power industries in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Luankou (including Beidaihe and Liushouying), Nandasi, and Changli. For the electric power industries in Beiping and Zhangjiakou, power plants are planned to be built in the Qin, Tang, and Luan areas to control the electric power industries in the key towns along the Beining Railway line, develop light and heavy industries, and supply electricity to meet the needs of companies such as Zhongfang Textile, Shihe Rayon Factory, and Toyo Textile Company. In Beiping and Zhangjiakou, in addition to focusing on electric lights, attention is also being paid to suburban streetcars, and the construction of the Tangshan, Nankou, and Xiangshan streetcar lines is already in the planning stages. The Xingzhong Company plans to build a total of 350,000 kilowatts of power plants in the above-mentioned locations. The Tianjin plant will have 100,000 kilowatts. According to their investigation, the entire city of Tianjin currently has 80,000 kilowatts of electric power equipment, of which 15,000 kilowatts each are owned by the British and French concessions, and the remainder is owned by the Belgian tram and lighting company. In the future, after the company's new plant generates electricity, it will gradually acquire it to complete the entire electric power rights. If this cannot be realized temporarily, it will definitely supply 50,000 kilowatts of electricity to Special District 1, 3, the Japanese Concession, and the suburbs of Tianjin to surround the Belgian power plant, preventing it from developing and eventually forcing it to sell. It will also send electricity at low prices, allowing users to freely choose, as a tool for competition. Outside of Tianjin, 250,000 kilowatts of electricity will be distributed for construction in Ping, Tang, Qin, Zhang, and Luan. In the area east of Australia, the Luanhe and Shihe Rivers will be used for hydroelectric power, making construction easier. The Xingzhong Company also believes that for the economic development of North China, electric power is the pioneer of everything and domination must be achieved, so it has been actively engaged in this work recently. The Tianjin power plant has been expanded and reorganized in consultation with the Tianjin Municipal Government on the basis of the Xinji Electric Power Company in Special District 1, and renamed Tianjin Electric Power Co., Ltd. It was established on the 22nd, and is presided over by Hirayama, the Xingzhong resident director in Tianjin. There are more than 40 Chinese and Japanese employees. The site has not yet been surveyed, but construction will begin no later than late October and will be completed next October. The plant belongs to the Sino-Japanese joint venture Tianjin Electric Power Co., Ltd., and specializes in electric power. Suburban streetcars will be operated separately and will not begin construction until the power plant is built. The total amount of funds is 4 million yuan, borrowed from Japanese capital, which has been contacted by Hirayama. The Manchuria Electric Power Company will provide the capital. Although the contract has not been signed, there should be no major problems. The only difference is the repayment of principal and interest. Many local gentry and merchants in Tianjin are unwilling to have this public utility be seized by foreigners, so Zhao Ziyu and others have jointly petitioned the municipal government, requesting that they raise funds to manage it themselves, or operate it as a joint-stock company, attracting a small amount of Chinese capital, and not borrowing exclusively from Japanese loans. The municipal government specially convened Zhao and others for discussion on the morning of the 23rd and agreed to the investment proposal. However, it was said that it must be approved by the company's board of directors before a decision can be made. The Tianjin authorities have nothing to say, but the attitude of the Japanese side is still speculation.</p>
<p>Toyo Paper Manufacturing Co. plans to raise 20 million yuan to set up a paper mill because of the strong sales of western paper and newspapers in North China. The main factory is in Tokyo, and the first branch factory will be set up in Chentangzhuang or Dazhigu between Tanggu, Tianjin. It will use Huai from Hebei and Shandong and utilize the Haihe River's water conservancy to produce newsprint and general-purpose western paper. The planned production is 1,000 tons, which will be sold exclusively in North China. Uchida, the former director of the Taiwan Colonial Products Bureau, has been assigned to plan it. He came to Tianjin not long ago to conduct a preliminary investigation before starting factory construction. In addition, Osaka Joint Paper Manufacturing Co. also plans to raise 5 million yuan to purchase 3,000 acres of land in Dazhigu, Tianjin, to make paper from reeds growing locally. Construction work may be realized at the same time as Toyo Paper Manufacturing Co. (23rd)</p>

Qiu Chuanmeng, secretary of the General Headquarters Highway Office, and others were dispatched to test the road, traveling in two buses. They departed from Guiyang on the 12th and arrived safely in Kunming at 7:00 PM on the 14th. The 600-kilometer journey used to take 20 days on foot, but now it can be reached safely in four days. Once the paving is completed and the entire road is unblocked, it can be reached in about two days. The route will be from Kunming to Panxian on one day, and from Panxian to Guiyang on the next. After opening to Guizhou, it will be possible to reach Hunan via the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, and then to various provinces across the country. This is truly an important page in the history of transportation in the southwest. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>There are 18 stations between Kunming, Yunnan Province, and Guiyang, Guizhou Province. In the past, transportation was inconvenient, and it took about 20 days to reach on foot. After Chairman Long took charge of Yunnan, he prioritized transportation as a key policy for construction. He decided to devote all efforts to building highways throughout the province. The initial plan was to build four trunk roads and eight branch roads throughout the province. The road from Kunming to Panyi Shengguan is 229 kilometers long and is the main road in eastern Yunnan. Except for the 17-kilometer section from Kunming to Dabanciao, which was a dirt road built by the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee during the relief efforts in 1926, the rest was surveyed and measured in January 1929. At the same time, earth road construction was started in sections. By 1931, the road was open to Yanglin, in 1932 to Qujing, and in 1933 to Panyi. The entire road was a difficult project. The dirt road was built by requisitioning laborers, and bridges and culverts above a certain size were built with provincial funds. Bridges below a certain size were built locally. The construction of bridges such as the Maguo River, Baishi River, and Yiqiao was particularly difficult. It is estimated that the projects built with provincial funds cost more than 2 million, and the earthwork and bridges and culverts built locally cannot be counted. The roadbed of the entire road is quite solid. After the paving is completed, it can pass trucks with a load of more than 15 tons. The gradient of the entire line is no greater than 8%, and the radius of curvature is no less than 48 feet, making driving quite safe. Even if a railway is built in the future, it can be used after some repairs. Currently, the paving work on the section from Kunming to Songming has been completed, and the section from Songming to Panyi is being carried out in sections and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The section of the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway within Guizhou Province, from Panyi to Panxian, is 60.85 kilometers long. Last year, it was ordered by Chairman Chiang to be built by Yunnan Province, with a central government subsidy of 150,000 yuan. Surveying began in June last year, and work was carried out actively, completing the project last month. A total of 200,000 yuan was spent. The section from Guiyang to Panxian includes the section from Guiyang to Huangcaishu, which is over 100 kilometers long and was completed during the reign of Zhou Xicheng in Guizhou, but it was not entirely perfect. The section from Huangguoshu to Panxian is 206 kilometers long. The General Headquarters Highway Office was ordered to build and reorganize the section from Guiyang to Huangguoshu last year. Surveying and construction began on September 11 last year, led by engineers Xu Mingjie and Zou Yuesheng in sections. It was completed on September 10 this year. The cost of each road is about 1 million yuan. The Banguan Slope special project is still in progress, but it does not hinder direct traffic.</p>
<p>After the completion of the Yunnan-Guizhou Highway, the General Headquarters Highway Office dispatched special commissioners to test the road. They departed from Guiyang on the 11th of this month. The Yunnan Provincial Government and the Road Bureau prepared a reception. The Road Bureau's Secretary Zhang and Chief Technician Li and others welcomed the travelers at Dabanciao at about 2:00 PM on the 14th, traveling in two cars. The vehicles from Guizhou arrived safely at 6:00 PM. The personnel from Guizhou who came to test the road included Qiu Chuanmeng, secretary of the General Headquarters Highway Office, engineering directors Xu Mingjie and Zou Yuesheng, General Headquarters supervisor Yin Haoyue, General Headquarters technician Ren Yongxu, Jian Gang, member of the Guizhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Xiao Weimin, a correspondent from the Central News Agency in Guizhou, a total of eleven people. All were hosted by the Road Bureau and stayed at Deyichun. After this road is opened to traffic, not only will transportation between Yunnan and Guizhou provinces become more convenient, but it will also be possible to establish links with the central government and the provinces along the Yangtze River. The Guizhou-Hunan Road can be used to reach Changsha in Hunan Province, as well as Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces. It will take only ten days to reach Hangzhou from Kunming. Its benefits to the transportation, culture, and national defense of the southwestern provinces are immeasurable. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Niu Yongjian Requests Protection of Songjiang Fishermen's Livelihood <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Regarding a dispute over maritime boundaries between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fishermen from Jinshanzui, Songjiang County, were fishing at sea. Their fishing grounds have always been in the waters around Baishan. Recently, due to the jurisdictional issue over the Shengsi Islands in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there has been a dispute over the demarcation of maritime boundaries. Both sides are arguing, as if it were a national border, causing the Baishan fishing grounds of the Jinshanzui fishermen to be designated by the fishermen of Baishawan, Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, as belonging to Zhejiang territory, and people from other provinces are not allowed to fish. The fishing gear in the fishing grounds was wantonly destroyed, and force was used to refuse them. Niu Tiesheng, Vice President of the Examination Yuan, believed that this matter was related to the livelihood of the fishermen of Songjiang, and specially wrote to Shen, the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, requesting to take charge of protecting them. The original letter is transcribed below: "Mr. Baixian Jianjian, according to the letter from Mr. Zhang Mingguang of the Songjiang County Fishermen's Association, Jinshanzui in the southern part of Songjiang County faces the sea, and the coastline is more than thirty li long. The residents all make a living by fishing at sea. The fishing ground is on the Baishan sea surface southeast of Jinshanzui, commonly known as Hengdi. Every spring, stakes are driven and ropes are tied to set up nets for fishing, which stops at the Lesser Heat Festival. For generations, everyone has lived in peace. This spring, Pan Chunfu and Pan Fusheng from Baishawan, Pinghu County (more than 20 li west of Jinshanzui), coveted the Hengdi and led many people, carrying rifles, to break into the Hengdi fishing grounds of the Jinshanzui fishermen. They cut down 125 sets of fishing gear set up by Yang Qiusheng, Fan Ade, Lu Baogen, Wu Agui, and others. Mr. Shen was requested by telegram to ask Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province to order Pinghu County to stop this, and the Songjiang County Fishermen's Association and the Songjiang County Government filed a petition to the Jiangsu Construction Department for relief. Unexpectedly, Pinghu County falsely claimed that the Baishan sea surface was under the jurisdiction of the county and sent a letter to the Songjiang County Magistrate ordering the Jinshanzui fishermen to automatically remove their fishing nets. As a result, Pan Chunfu and others became even more rampant and continued to carry out destruction in the Hengdi fishing grounds of the Jinshanzui fishermen. On the 17th of June, they cut down and looted 59 sets of fishing gear in the Hengdi of Yang Qiusheng, together with the fish, with losses totaling more than 4,000 yuan. The livelihood of the year has been completely cut off. Considering that the area in the sea is vast and the fish production is inexhaustible, the number of fishermen in Jinshanzui is small, and it should not hinder the livelihood of the fishermen in Zhejiang Province. Therefore, I respectfully ask you to transfer this matter to the Jiangsu Construction Department, send personnel for on-site inspection, and declare that the Baishan sea surface will always be the Jinshanzui fishing ground. On the one hand, please order Zhejiang Province to order Baishawan Pan Chunfu and others to compensate the Jinshanzui fishermen for their losses in full to relieve their difficulties. I have checked that the case of the dispute between the fishermen of Jinshanzui and Baishawan was previously requested by the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order the subordinates to stop it. Now, according to the letter, this case has been delayed and not resolved, and another huge loss was caused on June 17. Although there are boundary disputes between provinces and counties, the fishermen of the two provinces are all citizens of the country, and the fishermen of Jinshanzui seem to be small in number and should not be cut off from their livelihoods. At this time, when the country is in a serious situation, the fishermen on the coast should be trained and organized to know how to unite against foreign enemies. The actions of the fishermen of Baishawan are close to private fights, and this trend should not be allowed to grow. Mr. Shen is holding on to his pain, and I dare to turn around and ask you to select fair and appropriate personnel to work with Zhejiang Province for on-site inspection, and to discuss a fair solution so that the fishermen of the two provinces can benefit from it. The locality is fortunate. I hope you will understand this is fortunate, Niu Yongjian, Respectfully."</p>

<p>— The Conte Verde Arrives in Hong Kong (Continued)</p>
<p>— Xu Shu</p>
<p>Arrived in Hong Kong at eight o'clock in the morning on the 30th. People who have been to Hong Kong are eager to say goodbye, while those who have never been there naturally want to visit. After two days and two nights of sailing, they should see the land. After two days and two nights of foreign meals, they should switch to Japanese flavors, so almost everyone went ashore.</p>
<p>We mailed letters and bought some things, and then wanted to hire a car to tour all of Hong Kong. Our group had a total of six people. We hired a car at China Travel Service. The car that place managed to get was a private chauffeured car, and was stopped by a Chinese policeman. We all went to the police station of what the policeman called "our government." The policeman spoke very fiercely, but when he arrived at "our government," he was no longer powerful. The translator told us that private chauffeured cars were prohibited from doing business, to prevent drivers from earning money privately. Since this car was from the Eight Nations Hotel (the driver said it was from the Six Nations Hotel) and the owner was here (the owner had come upon hearing the news), it was different from ordinary circumstances. It seemed that the police officer could not please anyone. I told him that our time was limited and asked him to help us, so that we could leave first. He spoke to a fat, drunk foreigner, and the foreigner called us out. When we came out, the policeman also wanted to come out, perhaps to see us off, but he was scolded by the foreigner and reprimanded for bringing us there. I really wanted to hear what they said, but they seemed to not want us to stay any longer, so we left.</p>
<p>Taking a car around Hong Kong is just a fleeting glimpse. There are also articles about Hong Kong everywhere, so I have nothing to say. This British colony, wholly owned by China and managed for over ninety years, is clearly divided into two layers: managers and workers, British and Chinese. Under Chinese rule, it was just a desolate mountain and a small fishing port. Now, there are tall Western-style buildings, bustling streets, wide, winding paved roads, and streetcars and cars can go straight to the top of the mountain. Not to mention the universities, middle schools, and hospitals, the British have been able to manage this small place so well, and their abilities are admirable. But can't China do it? I don't know how many Chinese engineers can build these Western-style buildings and roads, and I don't know how many Chinese doctors can manage and establish such hospitals. China doesn't seem to be lacking the resources to manage these. But China never thought that a lonely, desolate island could be managed into a commercial port, and never thought that science could create a kingdom in a remote place. How many demobilized warlords and bureaucrats have been enjoying themselves in ready-made Hong Kong with tens of millions of dollars in assets, but who has thought of going somewhere else to manage another Hong Kong? After seeing Hong Kong, I feel even more that the Chinese nation only seeks to adapt to the environment and dares not resist the environment, which is a fatal injury. All politics and diplomacy...seek to adapt to the old environment and dare not create a new situation. I think it is all the inferiority of the same nation!</p>
<p>The ship stopped at Kowloon, and a small ferry was used to go to and from Hong Kong. There are many fishing families in Kowloon. At night, when the tide rises in the bay, they gather in groups to light up the lights and fish in the center of the bay. The fishing methods vary from house to house. They use sampans to light the lights and set up camp as the headquarters, and use small punts to cast nets. After surrounding the fish, the bow of the boat uses bamboo poles with wooden blocks to hit the water, making a sound like beating a drum, which scares the fish into the net.</p>
<p>In addition to fishing, they often wade into the crevices of the rocks, prying with fire sticks to search for lobsters, prawns, flower silkworms, groupers, yellow-legged wax...and some other things.</p>
<p>I heard that making a living in these hard ways is also difficult now. First, many of the rocky feet of the bay have been sealed off with reinforced concrete. Second, there are more and more Japanese fishing boats coming south, and they have better methods to exploit the fish in the bays.</p>
<p>In the dusk, when I saw a group of dark fishing boats from this large, white ConteVerde, I felt an infinite desolation in this beautiful seascape. I thought, if I were standing on that dark little boat at that time, looking at that white big ship, what would my feelings be? Isn't its huge white size a heavy oppression and fear?</p>
<p>But the white ship sailed away, leaving behind a little bit of light next to the mountain color, supplying the seafood for the people in those white buildings. And the ship had many more people. Mr. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of an army corps, also brought his car and entourage, in the palace-like first-class cabin, saying goodbye to Hong Kong, looking far away at Guangzhou outside the mountain, and thinking about the future, what kind of thoughts would he have? I seem to see that what goes from Western-style buildings to black fishing boats is one black copper coin after another, while what goes from generals out of white big ships are tens of thousands of yellow gold pounds!</p>

<p>The county's urban and rural telephone service is developing rapidly. The county government believes that the original regulations are no longer applicable, so it has revised the regulations on telephone charges and the interim measures for installing private telephones. The revisions have been submitted to the provincial government and approved. At the same time, a large-scale central switchboard has been installed, and the telephone exchange has been moved to the Jigu Granary, all of which have been completed. The new measures will be implemented from October 1st. The monthly fee for installing a private telephone will be five yuan, and government agencies and legal entities will be charged half price.</p>

<p>More than ten young people in this county, including Yan Wei, Shi Chengche, Xu Zhenya, and Sheng Xichang, jointly published the "Local Dialect Bi-Monthly." The office was located in the Bacheng Club in the Eighth District. Yan Wei and Shi Chengche were the editors, and Xu Zhenya was the publisher. The publication was issued for two issues. The content was not fair commentary but was specialized in scolding. County Magistrate Peng read the publication and was extremely angry at its intentional defamation. He immediately ordered it to be banned and instructed the Public Security Bureau to investigate. After receiving the instructions, the bureau detained Xu Zhenya and Sheng Xichang on the evening of the 23rd and summoned Yan Wei on the 24th for questioning. All were sent to the county for interrogation.</p>

<p>In the various townships of the Fifth District of this area, most farmers grow cotton. Last year, due to unfavorable weather conditions, the harvest was sharply reduced, and it was hoped that this year would compensate. Unexpectedly, the cotton fields this autumn were damaged even more severely by a night of strong winds. The township chiefs of Donghong, Shenshi, Yongan, and Wangxian townships have jointly submitted a report to the county government, reporting the disaster situation of the cotton fields in their area. The report stated that the heavy rainstorm on August 17th knocked off almost all the cotton bolls, and the flowers could hardly bloom fully. Now it is the cotton-picking season, but there are almost no flowers to pick. For Donghong and the other three townships, the total harvest is less than 20%, which is even worse than in previous years. Therefore, they are reporting to the county government and requesting that it be forwarded to the province for review.</p>

County Magistrate Deng, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang, Instructor Deng, Adjutant Gao, and others gave speeches on the essentials of air defense and protection against poison gas. Afterwards, the exhibition was opened to the public. Among the exhibits, a huge airplane model named "Yue Jun" was the most eye-catching. Other items such as demolition bombs, gas masks, battlefield rescue photos, and oil paintings of air defense illustrations were also quite alarming and attention-grabbing. The public flocked to visit.</p>

The youngest son, Rongfa, is 13 years old and is currently studying at school. On the 19th of this month, he had a conflict with his neighbor, Jiang Quand, and went to bed after returning home. Around 3:00 PM on the 23rd, he became very agitated. His mother thought it was malaria. Around 6:00 PM, she went to his room to check on him and suddenly noticed that he was gone. She ordered her two sons to search in all directions. After an hour, they had not found him. The mother and others re-entered the room to search and found Rongfa hanging himself from a beam with a trouser belt behind the bed. After the incident occurred, it was very strange and suspicious outside, because it was indeed unheard of for a thirteen-year-old boy to hang himself.</p>

<p>Jiaxing merchants believe that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has changed the method of collecting grain reserves, changing it to annual fundraising without restrictions.

<p>Dear Editor, I have just read a news item in the "Local Communications" column of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, reporting that Tugaohang has been fined a large sum of money, which is completely inconsistent with the facts.

We are still afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world, so we are sending this letter to request a correction. Sincerely, Jiading Sanxin Tugaohang.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Municipal Government: Protests Japanese Military Deployment Beyond Borders. Submitted a Written Protest to the Japanese Consulate General Yesterday Morning. Ordered the Public Security Bureau to Protect Overseas Chinese and Assist in Apprehending Murderers the Night Before. Director Cai Decides to Assist the Police in Strictly Apprehending the Murderers Yesterday <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the incident on the afternoon of the 23rd at 8:00 PM in which Japanese sailor Tagang was shot and killed by rioters near Haining Road and Wusong Road in the Hongkou Concession, the Japanese Naval Headquarters considered the situation serious. To search for the murderers and protect overseas Chinese, it immediately sent Marine Corps soldiers to deploy strictly in the concession and Zhabei, setting up sentries and checking pedestrians. The municipal government believes that although the Japanese Navy's actions are said to be for the protection of overseas Chinese, they concern the sovereignty of this country and cannot be agreed to. Regarding the protection of overseas Chinese, the municipal government has already ordered its subordinates to handle it strictly, and the Japanese Navy's actions are unnecessary. Therefore, Mayor Wu submitted a written protest to the Japanese Consulate General yesterday morning, requesting that the Japanese Marine Corps sent to the urban area be withdrawn immediately to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The municipal government issued an instruction to the Public Security Bureau at 9:30 PM on the 23rd, stating: "It has been reported that a Japanese sailor was suddenly attacked and shot by rioters near Haining Road and Wusong Road in the Public Concession, resulting in one death and two injuries. Although this case occurred within the Public Concession, in order to maintain the city's public security, it is urgent to find ways to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice. Since there are many Japanese residents within the jurisdiction of this city, we should continue to be vigilant and protect them strictly to avoid negligence. We hereby order the bureau to comply with and implement this order." Public Security Bureau Director Cai Jinjun spent the night at the bureau working, directing subordinate officers and police to be especially vigilant and investigate the perpetrators, and stepping up the protection of Japanese residents due to the incident in which Japanese sailor Tagang was killed in the corner of Haining Road and Wusong Road in the Public Concession the night before. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he convened a meeting at the bureau with the chiefs of various branches, stations, and teams, as well as senior officials of the bureau, to discuss the following measures: (1) Assist the Public Concession Police Department in strictly investigating the perpetrators in order to solve the case as soon as possible; (2) In the Zhabei area, the residential areas of Japanese residents should be strictly enforced by the chiefs of the relevant branches and stations in accordance with the previously issued measures for the protection of overseas Chinese, and the inspection department should send personnel to inspect at any time to prevent laxity; (3) After the occurrence of this case, residents in the Zhabei area will inevitably be panicked. The relevant police stations should inform each household that the bureau is absolutely responsible for local public security, and they should live and work in peace and not disturb each other or relocate, causing losses. All subordinates have been notified to comply with these instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Japanese Marine Corps Withdrawn from Zhabei Area Last Night <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the incident in which Japanese sailors were shot by rioters at the intersection of Haining Road and Wusong Road the night before, the Japanese Marine Corps, upon hearing the news, immediately deployed strictly around the incident site, on North Sichuan Road, from Laobazi Road to Jiangwan Road, and gradually expanded the area. In the Zhabei area, from Tiantong'an Road Tiantong'an Station to the east to East Sports Association Road, south to West Baoxing Road Yokohama Bridge, west to Yokohama River as the boundary, and north to Baziqiao, Shuidian Road, and Guangdong Middle School, sentries were densely deployed along the road, carrying guns and live ammunition, and strictly checking pedestrians. The situation was quite serious. By 6:00 PM last night, the team had been gradually withdrawn. There was no trace of Japanese troops at Tongji Road and Yokohama Road. Our Public Security Bureau also exercised its duties as usual. Only near the 63 Huayuan Garden had not been completely withdrawn. At the junction of the Chinese concession where North Sichuan Road crosses the border to build roads, the number of Japanese Marine Corps outposts had also decreased.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Details of the Shooting of Japanese Sailors in Hongkou Yesterday. The Japanese Side's Attitude Is Extremely Serious.

To Be Sent to Court Today for Hearing <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After three Japanese sailors were shot in the jurisdiction of the Hongkou Police Department of the Public Concession at the intersection of Wusong Road and Haining Road the night before, the Hongkou area was immediately tense. Almost all of the Japanese Marine Corps were deployed for defense, checking pedestrians with extreme strictness. The Police Department, fearing further accidents, urgently ordered all police detectives to patrol back and forth in coordination with those on duty. Starting yesterday, the entire reserve team was also ordered to report for duty to prevent any eventuality. All incident sites and junctions with the Chinese concession, from Bazhi Road to Jiangwan Road, were guarded by armed Japanese Marine Corps, and inspections were even stricter. However, the authority of Chinese police officers was not obstructed. Inside the Japanese elementary school at Arui Lane on North Sichuan Road and the Taoyue Dancing Ground at the intersection of Baoxing Road, branch offices of the Marine Corps have now been set up. The Japanese elementary schools in the Hongkou area have been temporarily closed starting yesterday by order of the Japanese Residents Association. Military vehicles and patrol motorcycles of the Marine Corps traveled frequently along North Sichuan Road to Jiangwan Road. Therefore, although the residents there witnessed the statement and announcement of Japanese Marine Corps Commander Kondo Eiketsu, they could not help but feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Three Suspects Handed Over to the Police Department Yesterday</p>
<p>As for the three suspects who were taken to the headquarters by the Marine Corps after the incident, one was Zhang Ronghe, from Taizhou, 21 years old, a peddler living at No. 8 Ruikang Lane, Disui Road. During a house-to-house search, he was arrested because Zhang happened to be wearing a tattered Western-style shirt, which was considered suspicious. There were also two brothers, named Ma Yongcai, from Jiading, 30 years old, and Ma Yongnian, 27 years old, who lived together at AC No. 9 Ruiji Lane, Dongjiaxing Road. During the day, both brothers worked at the China Printing House at No. 24, Lane 406, Shanhai Pass Road. The night before, the brothers finished work and walked home. When they passed Wusong Road, the incident happened to occur, and the military and police were searching. The two brothers suddenly saw the crowd gathering and the traffic stopping. Fearing involvement, they turned around and returned, and their steps were inevitably a little hurried. Unexpectedly, they were considered to be evading inspection and therefore arrested. The three were taken to the Marine Corps headquarters. After a night of detention and negotiations with the Police Department, Ma and his brother were first sent back to the Police Department at 12:30 PM yesterday.

<h3 id="e92">Autumn Native Products Festival Opens Yesterday. Expanded Publicity Promotes Native Products. Helps Economic Construction Movement <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Native Products Promotion Association stipulated that yesterday (the 24th) to the 30th would be the Autumn Native Products Festival. It has notified members everywhere and issued a declaration, asking everyone to promote native products uniformly. Yesterday was the opening of the Autumn Festival. The reporter went to the association on Xiafei Road to inquire about the meaning of the Native Products Festival. It is said that our country has many social programs, the meaning of which is only to provide the public with leisure, social interaction, consumption, and superstitious living opportunities. Therefore, everything that is eaten, worn, traveled, lived, and used, such as copper, iron, tin, wood, lacquer, and earth utensils, as well as native cloth and fruits, are all necessities for the festival. Social festivals are indeed the most prosperous days for buying native products. Since the failure of the Opium War, imperialists have continued to invade constantly. Under the coercion and inducement of foreign goods dumping and customs smuggling, all the items we need have gradually been transformed from native products into foreign goods. The psychology of foreign goods dumping purchasers, foreign goods manipulate the Chinese market, so leisure festivals have become places for selling foreign goods, in social festivals, it seems dishonorable not to wear foreign clothes or foreign goods, in banquets for guests, it seems embarrassing not to have wine and Western food, so native products are rejected from the market by foreign goods, and customs super-entry figures increase day by day, economic blood is also depleted day by day, after this kind of poison seed, the countryside went bankrupt, the crowd went unemployed, and the festivals that have been transformed by our society had to be changed. The value of the festival had to be lowered. The people of this association want to restore the meaning of the festival, increase the value of the festival, make the festival a competition of native products, make the festival a native products festival, make the festival have the determination to improve native products, make holidaymakers develop the habit of using native products, make holidaymakers create a self-rescue movement that unites production and sales, make holidaymakers create a lasting national economic construction movement, make holidaymakers create a self-governing, self-sufficient, self-defensive national self-conscious movement, So we stipulated that March 10 to 17 would be the Spring Native Products Festival, June 17 to 23 would be the Summer Native Products Festival, September 24 to 30 would be the Autumn Native Products Festival, and December 18 to 25 would be the Winter Native Products Festival. Now that it is the Autumn Native Products Festival, and the National Economic Construction Movement has begun to be active, the members of this association are working especially hard on this in order to fulfill their national duties.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Newly Appointed Gansu Provincial Finance Director Chen Duan Flies to Gansu This Morning <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Chen Duan (Xin Ming), the newly appointed Director of Finance of Gansu Province, has been in Shanghai for several days, contacting financial and industrial circles about investment matters, and there are already signs of progress. He is scheduled to fly to Gansu this morning on a Eurasian Aviation Company plane to take office. Chen met with reporters yesterday and issued a speech on the plan to reorganize the finances of Gansu Province, which is divided into the following:</p>
<p>Gansu Provincial Finance</p>
<p>Chen said that the finances of Gansu Province, after the previous Director Zhu formulated a balance plan, should not exceed the budget. However, due to a small part of the bandits making trouble, there were temporary special expenditures. In the future, when the banditry is calmed, it can be gradually restored. The total revenue part of this year's budget is more than 9 million yuan, and the expenditure part is 11 million yuan, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. According to the budget situation, the annual shortfall is 2 million yuan. If we engage in increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the financial future can be expected to be balanced.</p>
<p>Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>The reorganization plan is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, but in terms of palliative treatment it is reducing expenditure, and in terms of fundamental treatment it is increasing revenue. Because Gansu Province is located in a remote area, many products have not yet been developed, so there is more hope for cultivating tax sources. The first step that needs to be carried out urgently is the opening up of transportation routes, so that Gansu's special products such as woolen textiles can be transported out, and cotton textiles from other provinces can also be transported in successively. After the necessary items inside and outside the province are circulated, the production and construction can also be gradually increased. Secondly, we should also strive to carry out water conservancy construction, so that agricultural production can reduce the losses caused by drought. At the same time, we hope that people from all walks of life inside and outside the province will help develop various special products. In the future, production will develop, financial will revive, and there will be hope.</p>
<p>Contact Investment</p>
<p>According to Chen, while in Shanghai, he had private contacts with financial and industrial leaders in this city, asking them to invest in Gansu Province, develop various special products, and develop industries. He has now received permission from the leaders, and in the near future, an inspection team will be organized to go to Gansu for inspection, and then plans will be gradually implemented. The secretary Wang Lingxiao has already gone to arrange things. The company includes two finance department staff members Xue Minong and Xu Haoyuan.</p>

Chairman Li Dachao gave a report, stating that the purpose of purchasing airplanes as a gift to the government for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's fiftieth birthday was to honor Chiang's more than ten years of dedication to the country. He has worked tirelessly day and night, struggling amid internal and external troubles, enduring hardships and complaints without hesitation. Finally, he has achieved authority and virtue, suppressed the Red bandits, and completed unification, allowing the people to live in peace and the government to become more transparent. His great achievements are admired by all. Since Shanghai began raising funds to purchase airplanes to celebrate the birthday, it has received enthusiastic support from all sectors of society.

Slogans will be posted in prominent locations in all city agencies, organizations, companies, shops, and along major roads, and other powerful written propaganda will be used to attract the attention of all sectors of society, to recognize the significance of purchasing airplanes to celebrate the birthday, and to encourage greater participation in donations, so that those who have already donated will contribute more private funds, and those who have not donated will enthusiastically donate, so as to achieve the original goal of raising one million yuan, purchasing ten airplanes, and presenting them as a gift. It is hoped that important organizations and enthusiastic individuals in the city will provide powerful support. Furthermore, in order to expand the publicity for purchasing airplanes to celebrate the birthday, the committee has sent letters to the authorities of the Public and French Concessions, requesting their assistance in posting slogans in shops throughout the city. The two Concessions sent representatives to discuss the matter and agreed to cooperate. Yesterday, the committee also received a reply from the Public Works Department stating that slogans for purchasing airplanes to celebrate the birthday could be posted at the entrances of shops.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Ministry of Industry and Commerce Notifies Fishing Vessel Industry to Return Overcharged Fees <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday notified the Shanghai Fishing Vessel Industry Association that it had previously received a request from the association to promptly order the return of overcharged fees, and attached opinions on the case of abolishing the middlemen. It has ordered the resident supervisor of the Shanghai Fish Market to report jointly with the council, stating that (1) there are no clear legal provisions for the item of "uplift fee." In the past, the relationship between cargo owners and workers was close and frequent, so it was common to give some rewards to show consideration, but whether to pay or not was entirely voluntary by the cargo owner and could not be forcibly demanded. The association has already made a decision on this matter. However, once this practice started, it almost became a bad example, and disputes arose from time to time, which was contrary to the original intention. In order to eliminate disputes, the association had already informed the fish market to strictly correct it. Now, it is ordered to reiterate to the association that, in addition to the fees stipulated in the regulations, no other unfair fees should be charged and all bad practices should be abolished. The "uplift fee" is undoubtedly one of the unfair fees, and there is no objection to abolishing it. The association has been instructed to inform the market to order the unloaders to comply and return all previously overcharged amounts. (2) The sea fish unloaders intend to modify Article 1 of the operating regulations, and the purpose is nothing more than to charge an extra share of service fees. However, the article has not been approved. Before the amendment, the association had informed the market to order the unloaders to operate in accordance with the original regulations. However, the unloaders were too hasty and did not wait for the amendment of the article before arbitrarily overcharging. The association has repeatedly warned them, but the unloaders have been slow to comply. It is ordered to strictly implement Article 52 of the operating regulations and return the previously overcharged service fees in full within three days of receiving the document. If the unloaders violate the regulations again, the market should propose punishment measures. It is reported that the unloaders have returned all previously overcharged fees in accordance with the ministry's order. This case can be considered closed. (3) The opinions of the unloaders submitted by the fishing vessel association may not be entirely true. Since the establishment of the fish market, the setting up of unloaders in the process of centralized fish trading has been an indispensable tool. Whether there is a need for unloaders to exist in the future is another question, and it should be determined according to the needs of the environment.

<h3 id="e105">Dutch East Indies Abolishes Restrictions on Native Cloth Imports; Xu Tinglie Informs National Trade Bureau of the Process <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of this city received a letter from Xu Tinglie, the commercial commissioner of our country stationed in the Dutch East Indies, stating the agreement of the Dutch East Indies government to abolish the import restriction clauses of native cloth and the process. The original letter states: "To whom it may concern, in accordance with letters No. 627 and 1109 of April 24th and July 7th, I have replied to you on May 18th and August 7th respectively. Now, I will send you the results of the investigation and the unanimous efforts of the Dutch East Indies authorities in consultation. After receiving the first letter from your bureau reporting the situation of native cloth exporting to the Dutch East Indies, I conducted a detailed investigation of the political and business circles, such as the cotton lan (Mepan, Plembang, Pemgkal Pinang), Jambi, and Penang, and discussed everything in detail with the chambers of commerce there. According to the relevant commercial groups, the information can confirm the situation of the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association's call for the Dutch East Indies to restrict the import of native cloth. According to the report from the Batavia Cisis Import Bureau (the agency to which the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association sent five small samples), it can further prove the difficulties faced by native cloth merchants. According to the bureau, the first to fourth samples (i.e., Lin Dacheng, An Chun, Da You, Fang Fu) belong to tax number 257 and are not subject to import restrictions. The fifth sample (Xia Zhuang cloth) belongs to tax number 1575 and, because it exceeds the maximum weight limit, cannot be imported in theory. However, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, samples of the same quality as the fifth sample are not subject to this regulation. In other words, native cloth belonging to number 157 in terms of weight does not need to follow the 135 kg standard. Under the above circumstances, it is necessary for me to make formal representations to the highest-level authorities. Therefore, I tried to draw the attention of the acting director of the bureau to the decline of the industry. Although the director made concessions, it was still not entirely satisfactory. Last week, when I was in Batavia, I visited the acting minister of the Ministry of Economy of the Dutch East Indies government to discuss the difficulties faced by the restriction of native cloth. After repeated consultations, the acting minister agreed to make concessions. All kinds of native cloth (including the five cloth samples sent by your bureau and the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association) can be imported regardless of their weight, length, width, and the number of threads per seven square millimeters, as long as they can be sold in the Dutch East Indies market. The necessary procedure is only to apply for an import permit. Existing import merchants can obtain the permit as usual, while newly established merchants must go through reasonable consideration by the authorities. Now that the Dutch East Indies government is willing to give preferential treatment to native cloth importers, our country should formulate laws and regulations to implement a close approach. The first two points (increasing the import quota to show preferential treatment and revising the weight, length, and width restrictions) of the three points requested by the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association have now been achieved. The third point is slightly ambiguous, and it can be interpreted in two ways: (1) Reducing customs duties; (2) Reducing permit fees. (1) Reducing customs duties: The Dutch East Indies government's import tax on cotton cloth is 12% ad valorem and 50% surtax. It is not possible to modify the tariff. Therefore, it should be understood that because the value of native cloth is quite low, the import tax collected is also relatively small. (2) Reducing permit fees: The permit fee is 3 Dutch cents per hundred yards. The minimum fee paid for cotton cloth is 6.5 Dutch cents, which is only 5 Dutch cents difference. Even if native cloth can use the lowest fee, I believe that the small amount is not what the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association is fighting for. The points determined by the Minister of Economy have been enough to remove all obstacles to the transport of Chinese native cloth to the Netherlands. It is hoped that the Chinese native cloth industry will not only recover its lost market but also open up new markets. I have conveyed this news to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Medan, Jambi, and Penang. I hope that your director can forward the handling process to the Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association for the benefit of the public. Sincerely, Xu Tinglie, Commercial Commissioner stationed in the Dutch East Indies, to the Director of the International Trade Bureau."</p>

<h3 id="e106">Jiangsu Chamber of Commerce Federation Vigorously Strives for the Jurisdiction of Shengsi Islands to Belong to Jiangsu; Sends Separate Telegrams to the Executive Yuan and Ministry of Interior, Insisting on Determining the Border According to the Original Boundary <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shengsi Islands, located in the outer sea of Jiangsu Province, have been in dispute for more than a year since the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Zhejiang Province proposed that they be placed under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang Province. Recently, the Executive Yuan convened a review meeting, and the representative of Zhejiang Province proposed a new boundary, 30 degrees 53 minutes north latitude, which would include the Shengsi Islands and the entire sea area of Jinshan and Fengxian Counties. Representatives of the chambers of commerce of Chongming and other counties believed that this would seriously harm the fishing industry and economy of Jiangsu Province. The fifth membership congress of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation passed a resolution to send separate telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior, requesting that the border be determined according to the original boundary. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Premier Chiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, We, the [undersigned] association, held the fifth membership congress on the 20th of this month. The Chongming and other chambers of commerce proposed that Zhejiang Province is encroaching on Jiangsu's territory in the outer sea, and the Shengsi Islands, a mere fishing area, have a huge impact on Jiangsu's fishing industry and economy. We request that separate telegrams be sent to the central Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior to vigorously strive for the cause. This was immediately brought to the meeting for discussion. It was generally agreed that the maritime islands of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were clearly demarcated during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, with monuments erected to protect them forever. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu Provincial Government proposed to delineate the boundaries of the fishing area due to fishery disputes. The case was then negotiated by the representatives of the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the two ministries of Interior and Commerce, and a slight revision was made, but the original boundary was still approved, and it was also approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee. Recently, the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Zhejiang Province suddenly proposed that the Shengsi Islands be归劃ed to Zhejiang, which has been repeatedly opposed by Jiangsu Province. Now, it is heard that the representative of Zhejiang Province has proposed a new boundary line at the review meeting of the Executive Yuan, which is 30 degrees 53 minutes north latitude, which will include the Shengsi Islands and the entire sea area of Jinshan and Fengxian. This will seriously harm the fishing industry and economy of Jiangsu Province. We should present it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior separately, clearly order the determination of the maritime boundary between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and delineate it according to the original boundary, in order to prevent disputes. It was resolved and recorded in the minutes. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we hereby report the situation to your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) for review and approval, and grant a clear order to determine the border according to the original boundary for public convenience. Sincerely, The Presidium of the Fifth Membership Congress of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, Yu Xiaochuan, Cheng Ganqing, Lan Bohua, Qian Sunqing, Wang Xiaoting."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Opposing Joint Government-Business Operation: Tobacco Leaf Industry to Petition <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Due to the large-scale production of handmade cigarettes in Shanghai, which has a significant impact on national tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance is implementing control over tobacco leaves, setting up a buying and selling agency, which will be jointly operated by the government and merchants, with a capital of 500,000 to 1 million yuan. The tax authorities have convened a meeting of tobacco leaf merchants. The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association supports the central government's control, but believes that the joint operation of the buying and selling agency will cut off the livelihood of the industry. It has requested the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to forward the request to the central government for a change. Yesterday, the association again sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, requesting the two ministries of Finance and Industry to take into account both national taxes and the livelihood of merchants, abolish the joint government-business operation proposal, and find another appropriate method. It is reported that the association will send representatives to Beijing to petition if necessary.</p>

The first to arrive will be the cruiser USS Augusta, carrying Admiral Murfin, who will stay in Shanghai for a month. The other ships will stay for periods ranging from three weeks to a month. The USS Augusta is the flagship of the fleet, carrying 500 soldiers. It was docked in Qingdao for a long time this summer and is currently in Qinhuangdao. Admiral Murfin is currently in Beiping inspecting the U.S. Embassy guard and handling other official business. Before coming to Shanghai, he will also make a trip to Yantai.

<h3 id="e112">Leaders of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Representatives of the Paper Industry Petition: Requesting Exemption from Transport Permit for Paper Products <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Paper Industry Association, feeling difficulties in the transport and sale of various types of paper after the Ministry of Finance revised the list of goods subject to inspection for imported goods, specially appointed nine people, including Liu Minzhai and Zhang Peizhen, to petition in Beijing last night under the leadership of Ke Ganzhen, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Ge Jiezhen, the director. The petition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Paper Industry Association to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: We respectfully write to inform you that since the Ministry of Finance revised the list of goods subject to inspection for imported goods, the three words "cigarette paper" have been changed to "various types of paper," including cigarette paper. We are experiencing difficulties everywhere in the transport and sale of paper goods. It is permissible to disassemble and sell paper in small quantities, but the permit application process is cumbersome and cannot be completed on the same day, resulting in subsequent batches of goods being unable to continue to be transported and sold. In addition, domestically produced machine-made paper is also occasionally wrongly detained in other ports. Furthermore, there are discrepancies between the methods of the Railway Bureau and the Customs for domestically produced handmade paper from Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui. The Customs believes that there is no need to apply for a transport and sales permit, while the Railway Bureau believes that a permit must be obtained before release, resulting in the complete cessation of goods that were previously transported by rail, causing considerable losses and deep suffering. We have learned that cigarette paper in Shanghai is handled by cigarette companies and import firms. Although cigarette paper belongs to the paper category, it is not sold by the members of our association and therefore does not fall within the scope of the paper industry. Since rampant smuggling in North China, tax-evading cigarette paper has been smuggled into Shanghai in large quantities under the background of the Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Council, evading a considerable amount of paper and cigarette taxes, which should be strictly investigated to protect national tax revenue. As for other paper, no smuggled goods have been found in Shanghai. Examining the reasons, foreign paper is inexpensive, has a low tax rate, and the goods are bulky and not easily smuggled. The facts are all there for investigation. Our association recently received a joint request from members to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the original proposal and abolish the inspection of paper in order to alleviate suffering. Based on this, the Executive Supervisory Committee of our association passed a resolution on September 18 to appoint committee members Liu Minzhai, Zhang Peizhen, Zhang Ruikang, Xia Kangmin, Lu Muhan, Jin Jianxiang, Zhuo Nianci, Zhu Kangnian, Fan Xiling, and others as representatives to go to Beijing with the representatives of your association at 1:00 PM on September 23 to petition the Ministry of Finance to abolish the inspection of all types of paper other than cigarette paper in order to maintain business. We hereby respectfully inform your association and request your approval to send personnel to Beijing to lead the petition in order to promote public welfare.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Submission: Submission regarding the matter of petition (omitted). Upon investigation, handmade native goods are not included in the scope of the domestic goods transportation and sales licenses stipulated by your ministry. The customs follows the orders of your ministry and deems that no license is required, while the railway bureau holds a different opinion and often creates difficulties, which disrespects the orders of the competent inspection agency and causes merchants to feel at a loss. We have already submitted a telegram on the 12th of this month requesting verification and instructions. As for the association's request that the types of paper to be inspected should remain as stipulated in the initial decision, limited to cigarette paper only, and that other ordinary paper should not be included, this is purely based on the history of smuggling and infiltration and the absence of other ordinary paper involvement, as the basis for this petition. This is purely a matter of fact. Your ministry has detailed reports on the types of smuggled goods seized by customs authorities in various regions, which can easily corroborate the information provided by the association. Considering that the customs tariff lists imported foreign goods reaching over six hundred and seventy items, the current determination of about twenty types of imported goods to be inspected is based on whether there is large-scale smuggling of those items. If, as the association states, smuggled goods from North China infiltrating this city, except for cigarette paper, and no other ordinary paper has been found, then the non-inclusion of those paper types in the list of imported goods subject to inspection is consistent with other foreign goods. Based on the above, we respectfully recommend that representatives Ke Ganzhen and Jiezhen be dispatched to prepare documents for the petition, together with the representatives sent by the association, to respectfully consult with your ministry, present everything in person, and request your approval to handle the matter as requested, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<p>Response from the Ministry of Finance: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce reviewed, we have received your telegram, since it is claimed that the form and types of the said handmade native paper are completely different from foreign machine-made paper, the request to be exempted from the transportation and sales license can be approved as requested. We will instruct the Customs Service to notify the General Tax Office, Ministry of Finance (Official Seal)."</p>
<h3 id="e113">Brokers Using Transaction Orders: Ministry of Industry Sends Letter to Joint Association for Explanation <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry yesterday sent a letter to the Exchange Joint Association, stating: "Regarding the case of restricting exchange brokers from legally using transaction orders, this ministry previously stated that the case concerns the judiciary. After consulting with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Judicial Administration replied that it has ordered the Shanghai court to handle such exchange dispute cases where transaction orders are not used. Except for cases where their trading behavior is deemed legally invalid or subject to revocation, the brokers should first be ordered to reissue the transaction orders before being tried." Accordingly, the method of ordering the reissuance of transaction orders before trial, as replied, does impose a certain restriction on brokers who do not use transaction orders. However, the Exchange Law clearly stipulates that the transaction order should be made by the exchange and issued to both parties for signing. If they are allowed to reissue transaction orders after a dispute arises, it would contradict the intent of the Exchange Law. In order to effectively restrict illegal trading, the court should, in the event of broker trading disputes, order the reissuance only when the transaction has been legally registered and recognized by the exchange but the order has not yet been made. As for brokers who illegally do not use transaction orders, or whose transaction orders are not made by a legal exchange, their trading behavior should be deemed legally invalid, and there is no need to order the reissuance of transaction orders. After this ministry and the Ministry of Finance jointly sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for clarification and handling, we received a reply stating, "The previous letter from this ministry stating that brokers should first be ordered to reissue transaction orders before trial refers to legal transactions. If the court deems the trading behavior to be legally invalid or revocable, it should be handled separately according to law, and there is no need to order the reissuance of transaction orders. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Higher Court Second and Third Branch to inform, please be informed accordingly." The ministry hereby notifies the association to immediately inform all exchanges and broker associations. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Association of Bicycle Manufacturers and Dealers Requests Department for Relief of Freight: Five Points of Difficulty <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bicycle Manufacturers and Dealers Association, stating that freight transport has stagnated since the Ministry of Finance implemented inspections on bicycles and accessories under customs orders, has specially petitioned the Ministry of Finance for relief. The reasons for the difficulty, summarized into five points, are: (1) Bicycles and accessories are diverse, mostly purchased in batches and sold in installments. Considering just one bicycle, over thirty types of verification and tax payment documents are required. When merchants in other ports purchase, there are at least ten types and up to hundreds, and the busyness can be imagined. (2) Imported accessories may be several types or even dozens of types included in one tax payment document. For example, chains, sprockets, and steel wires are imported and assembled in one box with one document, which cannot be separated. If Company A purchases a dozen chains and they are being transported by customs and have not yet been returned, and Company B purchases sprockets and Company C purchases steel wires, they cannot be transported immediately. Furthermore, small accessories such as screws, springs, and small rubber parts are sold in batches of hundreds of packages, hundreds of dozens, or thousands of gross, often starting with one package, half a dozen, or several gross, and distributed to dozens or hundreds of households. However, customs restricts each tax payment document to at least one box, making it impossible to separate them for verification, which is practically impossible. (3) It takes a long time for customs to issue transport permits, and they stop working on Sundays. Bicycle merchants conduct business every day, and there must be dozens of shipments for export, resulting in backlog and stagnation, which has a significant impact. If customers in other ports purchase one or two bicycles for their own use, or small businesses purchase a small number of parts, and carry them with them for same-day return trips, they are completely stalled because the transport permits cannot be obtained on the same day. (4) When bicycle merchants report accessories for export, sometimes a portion is foreign goods and a portion is domestic goods, packed in the same box. Foreign goods must be verified and licensed, and domestic goods must be individually licensed by the manufacturers for domestic goods transportation and sales. One box of goods must wait until all transport permits are obtained before it can be shipped, which takes a long time. There are also cases where one type of domestic goods transport permit is obtained, but the other types of permits have already expired. (5) Military and commercial entities do not directly order goods but purchase accessories from other businesses to assemble complete bicycles. When selling, they must collect tax payment documents from other businesses in order to obtain transport permits, which is cumbersome and practically impossible. We have laid out the situation of the bicycle industry and request relief. However, it is understood that the association has previously sent representatives to the customs authorities to request convenience. The customs has now approved concessions, such as issuing certificates by the association for domestic bicycle accessories and complete bicycles for military use, for the purpose of obtaining transportation and sales licenses to facilitate matters. As for the association's enthusiasm for assisting in the detection of smuggling, it is actively underway. The association has distributed charters, voluntary letters, guarantee letters, and registration application forms to the industry within three days to find suitable guarantors to be submitted to the association for safekeeping, and has registered the inventory, while simultaneously reporting to the General Smuggling Association for record-keeping. The industry must register with the customs to obtain licenses, and has been notified to pay attention to avoid penalties.</p>

<h3 id="e116">New Clues in the Double Corpse Case at the Hongkou Women's Hospital: Zhang Wenhua's Rickshaw Puller Apprehended; Rickshaw Puller is Liang Meiyu's Younger Brother; Account of the Case Still Untruthful and Incomplete <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Inside the Hongkou Women's Hospital at 290 Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, this month on the tenth day, male and female corpses were found buried under the floorboards. Forensic examination revealed that they had been strangled to death, and the hospital owner Zhang Wenhua and his wives Zhang Yao and Liang Meiyu had all fled without a trace. Only the maid, Mrs. Fei Wang, a native of Wuxi, was apprehended by the police. After investigation, she was released by the Special First Court after questioning, as she had no suspicion of joint criminal conduct. The details have been reported in this newspaper many times.</p>
<p>The case is being handled</p>
<p>by Huang Fugen and Cui Chengke, Chinese detectives from the Huishan Police Station. They are sparing no effort in investigating Zhang Wenhua, Liang Meiyu, and others. All places related to Zhang have been thoroughly investigated. Zhang's father, Zhang Jinsheng, was also summoned by the detectives in order to inquire about his son's whereabouts. At that time, because Zhang Jinsheng's whereabouts were unknown, it was impossible to summon him. Until the afternoon before yesterday, Zhang Jinsheng suddenly arrived at the Huishan Police Station accompanied by two lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang. According to him, he is from Chuansha, 61 years old, and currently resides at 7 Cihou Nanli, Fuxu Road. His son Zhang Wenhua is 27 years old, studied at McLellan High School, and then worked as a nurse at Shilong Hospital for three years. He is not actually a doctor, and he does not know his whereabouts. He is currently doing his best to investigate so that he can be brought to justice to avoid implicating the innocent. After interrogation by the detectives, it was determined that Zhang Jinsheng was not involved and he was allowed to leave. Then, at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, the Huishan Police Station suddenly received a notification from the Motor Vehicle Office of the French Concession Police that a local man named Chen Pengfei (23 years old) was currently at the office to obtain a</p>
<p>driver's license.</p>
<p>The person was related to the double corpse case at the Hongkou Hospital. Huang and Cui, two detectives, went there and brought Chen back for investigation. It was learned that Chen was actually the younger brother of the fugitive main suspect, Liang Meiyu. Through Liang's introduction, he started working as a driver for Zhang Wenhua on August 29. The car Zhang drove had license plate number 7203. In addition to the Hongkou Women's Hospital, Zhang also had a clinic at 370 Minguo Road. Zhang went to</p>
<p>both places every day,</p>
<p>and Chen drove him. On September 2, Chen and Zhang drove out of the clinic on Minguo Road, intending to donate and obtain a permit at the French Police Motor Vehicle Office. However, when they reached Huagen Road, they collided with another car, and the car was damaged. On the 3rd, it was transported to the Xiechang Factory at 382 Manufacturing Bureau Road for repairs. Since then, Zhang has been using a rickshaw for transportation. According to Chen, on September 1, he saw Zhang Wenhua, Zhang Yao, and Liang Meiyu</p>
<p>together in the consulting room</p>
<p>At that time, there was also a woman about 25 years old sleeping on the bed, with a pale complexion and no blood color. The hair was permed, and the height was five feet four inches, and she seemed to be seriously ill. A man about 30 years old was sitting next to the bed, reading a newspaper, wearing white clothes and pants. He was in extremely good shape. According to the police's judgment, these</p>
<p>two people</p>
<p>may be the corpses that were found. Chen initially lived at 49 Wan, Disui Road, and has now moved to 704 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. However, he insisted that he did not know the whereabouts of Zhang, Liang, and others. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chen to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, explained the circumstances of Chen's arrest, stating that his account was incomplete and untruthful and needed to be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, he requested permission to detain him for a week. After Judge Xiao Xiefen briefly questioned Chen, he ordered that he be detained for a week for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e117">American Chinese Bank: The Truth About Soliciting Foreign Shares; Foreign Directors Only Acknowledged 100 Yuan and Didn't Pay; Two Lawsuits Continued Hearings Yesterday; Gu Yubo Evades Capture and Has Not Yet Been Arrested <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After the American Chinese Bank, founded by Gu Yubo and others, went bankrupt, the bank's British Chairman, Meng Lei, British Director Yale, and Malaituo initiated a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Gu and shareholders and directors Chen Yizai and Bao Ziwen for fraud and breach of trust, with an attached civil lawsuit seeking compensation for losses. Subsequently, fourteen creditors of the bank, including Wang Tingfang, hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a criminal suit against Zhang, Chen, and Bao, as well as other responsible parties Zhang Xusheng, Sun Wenkui, Li Yi-chou, Liu Tongfu, Wang Zhonglin, etc., for</p>
<p>Embezzlement and Fraud.</p>
<p>The two cases have been repeatedly summoned for trial. Only Sun Wenkui was summoned to court and ordered to be bailed out by his defense lawyer, Lin Yingqing. Except for Gu Yubo, who was ordered to be wanted, the others were summoned separately. Details have been reported previously. It is found that the predecessor of the American Chinese Bank was the Daxin Bank, founded by Jiang Baili, Lin Kanghou, Qian Chengxu, Shen Jingzhong, etc. Later, due to the difficulty in raising sufficient funds and the difficulty in registering, they cooperated with Gu Yubo through the mediation of Li Yi-chou and merged to form the American Chinese Bank. For Gu's appeal,</p>
<p>More Foreign Shares Were Collected.</p>
<p>Therefore, he initially hoped to obtain investment from American merchants to be called an American business. Because it could not be realized, he invited British merchants Meng Lei and others to join and registered with the British Consulate, so it was called a British business. In fact, Meng Lei, Yale, and Malaituo each only acknowledged one share, with a capital of 100 yuan per person, which has not been paid to date. Yesterday afternoon, it was the scheduled date for the continued hearing of the case filed by Meng and others. The plaintiffs added seven more households: Chen Huiqing, Chen Mingji, Yuan Boling, Chen Xiaochun, Chen Guanzhang, Ma Junxiang, and Ma Zanming. The founders of Daxin Bank, Jiang Baili, Lin Kanghou, Qian Chengxu, and Shen Jingzhong, were also</p>
<p>Gu Yubo et al.</p>
<p>listed as defendants. However, only Sun Wenkui and Wang Zhonglin appeared in court. The families of the two defendants, Chen Yizai and Bao Ziwen, also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to appear in court, stating that Chen and Bao were also defrauded of 50,000 yuan each by Gu Yubo. Now that Gu has fled without a trace, Chen and Bao believe that without Gu in court, they will inevitably suffer</p>
<p>adversity. Therefore, Chen and Bao have left home to search for Gu's whereabouts, not to avoid appearing in court. Now the plaintiffs request an arrest warrant. Our lawyer requests the court to extend the time to allow Gu to be found, or to wait for Chen and Bao to return and order them to report the case. Zhang Xusheng also hired lawyer Qian Zheng to appear in court on his behalf, stating that Zhang</p>
<p>is ill in Hangzhou</p>
<p>and requested an adjournment. The court then decided to first hear the case of fraud and breach of trust filed by the three British men, Meng Lei, etc., against Gu, Chen, and Bao. According to the three plaintiffs, they each acknowledged one share, with a capital of 100 yuan, which has not been paid. Meng Lei was paid a monthly salary of 350 yuan because he also served as an accountant, but he only received it for one month. Ye and Ma did not receive any salary. They themselves did not suffer any losses. The purpose of the lawsuit is purely for the benefit of the depositors. If the defendants are ordered to compensate for the losses, the proceeds should belong to the bank for repayment of debts, etc. Subsequently, the accountant in charge of the bank's liquidation reported the</p>
<p>Verification of Accounts</p>
<p>situation, saying that when Daxin transferred to American Chinese Bank, the balance sheet showed a capital of 600,000, but the actual receipt was only 345,000 yuan. Also, the recorded deposits of 210,000 yuan in Central and Citibank were found to have no deposits at all. Therefore, the record of this form. Because there are no account books to compare, it is difficult to determine whether it is actually true. After the plaintiff's lawyer debated, Judge Huang instructed that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 29th of this month. Immediately after that, the lawsuit filed by Wang Tingfang was heard. Lawyer Lin Yingqing represented the defendant Sun Wenkui</p>
<p>Submitted Evidence,</p>
<p>stating that Sun was neither an assistant manager nor a shareholder of the bank. However, the plaintiff's attorney Wu Peng still insisted that Sun was indeed an assistant manager and considered a shareholder, having paid 3,000 yuan of shares. Because the stock was not issued at that time, the money was temporarily treated as a deposit. Huang Yun, a woman who used to answer the phone at the American Chinese Company, testified that she had heard colleagues say that Sun was also a shareholder. Judge Huang adjourned the trial until another date because it was late.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Haili Carries Strange Passengers, Transports Bomb Casings; Four Baskets Filled and Placed in the Cabin; Takes Advantage of Inattention to Go Ashore Again <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili ship, this time returning to Shanghai from Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shantou, stopped at Shantou on the afternoon of the 23rd as usual for passengers and cargo to disembark and embark. At that time, two passengers boarded the ship from Shantou, one named Su Yixin and the other named Liu Kechun, claiming to be going to Shanghai. They purchased two seats in the special third-class cabin, and the ship issued two tickets numbered 3388 and 3389. When the two boarded the ship, they carried four large bamboo baskets, which seemed quite heavy. According to Su and Liu, someone would come to take these four bamboo baskets away soon, and they would not be taken to Shanghai, so they were temporarily placed in the cabin. When the two boarded the ship, there were many people picking up and dropping off passengers, and the ship did not have time to pay attention to and inspect the items in the four baskets. When the ship was about to sail, the chief steward Zhuo Zhensheng went to the cabin to check and saw that the four bamboo baskets were still in the cabin. He urgently searched for the two passengers to have them moved away, but the two passengers were nowhere to be found. It was expected that they had taken advantage of the inattention and secretly gone ashore. Zhuo opened the four baskets and found them filled with bomb casings, in large numbers, but without any explosives. Zhuo discussed it with the shipowner and agreed to temporarily hand over the four baskets of bomb casings to the Shantou Bureau and report it by telegram. The Haili ship is still on its way, and the Bureau has decided to thoroughly investigate the matter of the strange passengers transporting bomb casings to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>The case of the murder of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo has been thoroughly investigated by the First Special Court against Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, and Zhou Sherong, who were sued by the police, but a verdict has not yet been reached. The First Special Court originally scheduled a collegial panel to hold a public trial this week, but due to various procedures not being completed, it has been decided to reschedule the court hearing to 2 pm on the 1st of next month in the first criminal court. At that time, it will be presided over by Judge Qian Hongye, Judges Xiao Xiebin and Feng Shide, Prosecutor Tang Peiyou, and Clerk Ding Chongnan in a collegial panel. If time permits, the debate will begin between the Lake District residents who came to Shanghai and stayed at Yu's (Liu claims) place. The two girls, one eighteen and one in their early twenties, are both unmarried. They came to Shanghai this time for the</p>
<p>Sole Purpose.</p>
<p>The reason is that both of them are pregnant and have been for four months. They came to Shanghai specifically to seek medical abortion and to engage in prostitution. However, I feel that abortion is inhumane and dangerous, so I am unwilling to participate in this discussion. However, I regret that the two girls are very determined and fear that they will insist on doing so," etc. When the reporter heard what the young man said, he couldn't help but</p>
<p>be surprised and immediately returned to his residence, and instructed the young man to call the two girls over. After briefly inquiring about their names, one of the girls had received considerable education, and after the reporter persuaded them, and showed them the news previously published in this newspaper about the female worker Wan Lai from Anhui in the Tongxing Yarn Factory on Macao Road who tragically died from abortion due to an impending marriage, one of the girls burst into tears and sobbed for a long time before answering,</p>
<p>"People are not plants,</p>
<p>how can they be without feelings? Even though people are extremely poor, who doesn't cherish their life? Although we (the girl claimed) are weak women from the countryside, we have received considerable education. In recent years, the countryside has gone bankrupt, and we have had no choice but to engage in illicit relations for the sake of livelihood, which is what is called rural prostitutes. But heaven does not pity people, and unfortunately, we have conceived. It has been over four months now. During this early pregnancy, prostitution can still barely be maintained, but after this,</p>
<p>the belly will grow</p>
<p>and it will not be possible to continue. If we wait for it to be formally produced, it will take half a year, and postpartum recuperation will take at least two months. May I ask how will the livelihood problem be solved during this long period of eight months? Therefore, we have been thinking day and night that it is better to take a temporary risk than to wait for formal production and become starving corpses. Our environment is like this, sir (referring to the reporter),</p>
<p>what do you think?"</p>
<p>After the reporter heard this, he was sad for a long time. After repeated consultations, there were three friends present who all expressed their willingness to provide financial assistance, until the two girls were sent to the hospital for delivery and discharged from the hospital. All expenses were fully responsible by the reporter and friends. At this point, the two girls expressed their approval. Recently, according to the two girls, in recent years, there have been many people from Pinghu alone who have come to Shanghai specifically for abortion, and those who have sacrificed their lives because of this are countless.</p>

<p>At about 11:40 yesterday morning, at No. 17, Lane 46, East Traffic Road, Zhabei, the Fuxing Glass Factory suddenly exploded due to adding oil to the polishing machine. With a loud bang, flames shot out and a fire broke out. Worker Dong Xiaosan, a native of Yancheng, 18 years old, was burned to death in the fire. Another worker, Liu Henglu, a native of Yancheng, 18 years old, was severely burned and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The Hujia Muqiao Hongzhen Fire Brigade, according to the police, drove the pump belt car to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at 12:45 pm, and four factory buildings were burned down. The factory owner, Ye Guchan, has been detained and sent to the General Bureau for questioning. The body of Dong Xiaosan was inspected by Prosecutor Xu Zenghui from the local court at about 4 pm and ordered to be coffined.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Goods Shipped from Shanghai to Jiangxi to Be Transported by Original Train Across the River <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Since the Nanchang Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway opened to traffic in January this year, goods shipped from Shanghai to Jiangxi and transported by rail have been extremely crowded. However, because the Qiantang River Bridge has not yet been completed, it cannot be directly reached by the original train. The goods must be unloaded from the ship at the Zhakou, transported across the river by barge, and then loaded onto the train. The repeated loading and unloading takes a lot of time. The Jinghu, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities have specially prepared a ferry to facilitate the transportation of goods and develop combined transportation, which can directly load the original train across the river, which is very fast, without unloading the goods from the ship. It is also stipulated that goods shipped from Shanghai to Nanchang must arrive within three days, which is more than twice as fast as shipping by boat. In the future, freight transportation between Shanghai and Jiangxi will inevitably become more developed. It is reported that the ferry has now been completed and will begin to be used on October 1. Shanghai-Jiangxi cargo merchants will feel endless convenience.</p>

<p>Xue Jiasheng, the son of the late paint tycoon Xue Baorun, was kidnapped by bandits who broke into his residence at around 4 pm on August 1 while he was taking a nap in his residence. The bandits demanded a huge ransom for his release. On the 14th of the same month, Inspector General Jin Jiulin and Qian Chenglong of the Special Agency of the French Police, detectives Zhou Bingcheng and Zhou Buguang, led detectives on duty to investigate and solve the case. The kidnapped person was found safely in the agency at No. 222 Pushi Road because the kidnappers fled upon hearing the news. At the same time, the detectives successively arrested the kidnappers Chen Jintang (40 years old, Anhui native), Bu Mingqing (42 years old, Xuzhou native), Sun Yanan (38 years old, Yancheng native), Pu Yaozhang (55 years old, Yangzhou native), and Wu Genyou (39 years old, Ningbo native) at No. 72 Delong Village, Julai Road, and seized Mauser pistols, Browning pistols, and bullets. They were sent to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. After repeated trials by the Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu, the judgment was scheduled. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, when the judgment was due, at 2 pm, Judge Wang and Clerk Gao Yan visited the Criminal Court and ordered the five defendants to be brought to the case. After briefly questioning their ages and origins, the judgment was announced. Chen Jintang was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly intending to extort a ransom and kidnap people. Bu Mingqing (same crime) was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. Wu Genyou (same crime) was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment and 10 years of deprivation of civil rights. The handguns and bullets were confiscated. Sun Yanan and Pu Yaozhang were found not guilty. Furthermore, because the Medical Office found that one of the handguns seized in the case was opened in the case of plotting to kidnap Lu Dengyu at the intersection of Carter Road and Aven Avenue in the Public Concession on June 12 this year, the Xinzha Police Station requested the First Special District Court to send a document to the Second Special Court requesting that the five defendants be transferred to the case for investigation and trial. After the Judge of the Civil Court reviewed the official document, he instructed that the five defendants be handed over to the officers to take them away for trial.</p>

Concluded Debate Yesterday and Scheduled Judgment <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhuang Zezhong and Zhuang Zeren, local residents who currently reside at No. 25, Lane 288, Beck Road in the Public Concession and work as senior officials in the Jianghai Customs, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Feng Dazhang, the father-in-law of their deceased brother Zexin, and Feng Peigeng, Feng Peikun, and Feng Peizhi, the sisters of their deceased sister-in-law, seeking confirmation of guardianship rights. The complaint stated that the plaintiff's deceased brother Zhuang Zexin had been working in the customs service and married the defendant Feng Dazhang's youngest daughter Peiyu, with whom he had an eldest daughter, Huizhi (nine years old this year). His younger brother Zexin died unexpectedly on April 2, 1934 (drowned in the river). His sister-in-law Peiyu raised the orphaned son and daughter. At that time, Zexin received several thousand in customs pensions after his death, and private savings of about ten thousand yuan, all of which were kept by his sister-in-law. Since Zexin's death, his sister-in-law has been depressed all day long, and died in the hospital on July 28 last year. All of Peiyu's inheritance was in the hands of the defendants. After Peiyu's death, she left behind a son and a daughter, who were initially raised by the plaintiffs. However, the defendants, fearing that they would demand Peiyu's inheritance, took Huizhi and Zhengda away under the pretext of raising their nephews and nieces at the plaintiffs' place. The plaintiffs stated that the Zhuang family's flesh and blood could not be raised by others for a long time, so they filed a lawsuit requesting a judgment confirming their guardianship rights. Yesterday morning, the court, based on the complaint, summoned the defendants to the Civil Court 7, presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendants hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend on their behalf, requesting that the plaintiffs' lawsuit be dismissed. After the court questioned both parties in detail, it ordered the debate to begin and announced its conclusion, scheduling the judgment for the 29th of this month.</p>

<p>Xu Wenliang, the Cantonese manager of the MeiFoo Petroleum Company, lived at No. 1305 Yu Garden Road. On the morning of July 14 this year, bandits suddenly broke into his home with weapons, robbed him of his property, and kidnapped Xu to extort money. Later, Feng Baishun and other Chinese detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station successively arrested the bandits Cao Chunbao, Lu Laisheng, Zhang Heshang, Zhang Guiqing, Zhang Xushi, Yang Chunshan, Lu Agen, Tang Heming, Shen Tingyan, Du Haisheng, Chen Zhihong, etc. and sent them to the First Special Court. The confession was clear. Because the location of the case was in the Chinese border area beyond the concession road, it was ordered that Yang Chunshan and Chen Zhihong, who committed another robbery case within the border, be detained for sentencing, and the remaining nine people, including Cao Chunbao, be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the Criminal Court 8 and announced the judgment on Yang and Chen. The main text was: Yang Chunshan, a habitual offender of armed robbery, is sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. Chen Zhihong, intending to use them for criminal purposes, possessed military guns and bullets, and is sentenced to four years of imprisonment. The stolen goods are returned to the owner.</p>

<p>The first fine arts exhibition of the Chinese Fine Arts Association opened yesterday in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store on Nanjing Road. The viewers were extremely crowded, and they all agreed that the scale of this exhibition, the quality of the works, and the beauty of the display surpassed all public and private exhibitions in recent years. Among the more than 300 exhibits, there were posthumous works of the association's late member, the famous painter Zhang Xian, which drew particular admiration from viewers. Zhang had traveled to France twice and had extremely deep attainments in oil painting, sketching, and Chinese painting, creating a new style. He returned home this summer vacation and died of liver disease. Those who knew him mourned his talent and short life. Overall, the association's exhibits this time are extremely rich in quantity and quality, and the firm and sharp style is a characteristic of the association. It is said that the exhibition period will last until the 20th of this month. A part of the Great World Department Store's painting hall, which is currently used as the exhibition venue, will be converted into the Great World Dining Hall.</p>
<h3 id="e133">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Thoroughly Investigates Handling Disputes <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a state-run enterprise, handled the bidding for handling labor at various docks, and has announced the winning bidders. The contractors for the North and Central docks took over on the 1st of this month, and all loading and unloading work proceeded as usual. The winning bidder for the South dock handling labor was Li Huanxin, who also took over on the 16th of this month. However, for several days, an announcement signed by Zhang Huisun has been published in the newspapers, mentioning He Tiehua, the manager of the North dock. It is not known whether this is a dispute within the internal organization of the contractor. However, the Bureau believes that the winning bidder for the South dock is Li Huanxin, who has signed a contract with the Bureau. The Bureau legally recognizes the contractor Li Huanxin as the relevant party for the South dock handling labor matters and should not be related to Zhang Huisun and He Tiehua, the manager of the North dock. Unless there is another inside story, it is another matter. Seeing the published announcement alleging that Dock Manager He invited others to jointly operate the South dock handling labor, and that Dock Manager He used the pretext of lobbying to win the bid and distribute a 6-share dry stock, the matter is bizarre and related to the Bureau's reputation. It is reported that the Bureau has strictly ordered the Dock Management Department to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to investigate and deal with it.</p>

<p>In Shanghai County, it has been more than half a year since the implementation of the general inspection of opium in various districts. However, after County Chief Li Zhifu took office, he paid considerable attention to the prohibition policy. Considering that prolonged periods lead to complacency, and fearing that public officials in various districts might become negligent, he specifically instructed a general inspection to be completed by the end of this month. It is understood that all officials in the political and police circles of each district made a solemn pledge to eradicate opium, and their responsibilities are crucial. Therefore, after receiving the order, the heads of each district and township, along with the heads of the public security bureaus and stations, have been visiting opium dens and selling and smoking locations to investigate private sales and smoking. They are also using the baojia system to search house by house for private smokers and repeat offenders, requiring the heads of the jia to provide proof. After the deadline, the county government will send personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time.</p>

<p>The New Life Movement General Association yesterday sent letters to the New Life Movement Associations in various provinces and cities, instructing all labor service corps to standardize their armbands. The letter stated: "According to a report from the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, 'Upon investigation, the armbands worn by the New Life Labor Service Corps were previously issued in a specific style by your association. However, because they are now being freely printed in various locations, the sizes are inconsistent, and the colors are difficult to match, resulting in a lack of uniformity in appearance. This association has commissioned the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau to manufacture and distribute them according to the style issued by your association. The armband fabric uses high-quality domestic products and is printed with non-fading dyes, with a silk finish for easy writing. This association has reviewed them and found them to be quite合格, and approval has been given for their issuance. Moreover, the price is only six cents per armband to recover costs, which is very affordable. We have enclosed a sample armband and respectfully report to your association, requesting your review and instructing all New Life Labor Service Corps in provinces, counties, and cities across the country to adopt them uniformly to promote consistency.' Based on this, after examination, three points were found to be inconsistent, and the association was immediately informed to instruct the Party and National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau to make improvements. Now, the association has sent a revised armband sample, which has been reviewed and found to be suitable. In addition to acknowledging receipt and notifying the New Life Movement Promotion Associations of the railway lines in various provinces and cities to forward to their respective New Life Labor Service Corps for uniform adoption, we are writing to your association to request your attention to this matter."</p>

<p>The China Taoist Association yesterday notified the temples in this city, saying: "Regarding the matter of notifying, we have received an order from the Municipal Social Bureau stating that the registration of temples in this city should be completed by the end of September of this year. This has been announced repeatedly, and orders have been issued to inform you accordingly. Now, upon investigation, only more than 150 temples have registered so far, and there are still many that have delayed registration. Therefore, we are again ordering you to instruct all temples to register quickly. This matter concerns the rights and interests of the temples themselves, so do not make a mistake. This order, etc. Upon receiving this, we find that the general registration of temples nationwide is the government's intention to protect the rights and interests of all temples, so how can we allow delays and mistakes? Moreover, in consideration of the temples, this association has specially requested and obtained an extension to the end of September. Now that the deadline is approaching, there are still many places that have not applied for registration. We are now issuing a notice, urging those temples that have not yet registered to fill out the forms and submit them to the Social Bureau immediately. If you do not understand the procedures, you can come to the association to inquire, and we will provide guidance. This matter concerns government laws and regulations and the rights and interests of the temples themselves. If you continue to delay and wait and see, and disputes arise in the future, not only will there be many inconveniences, but this association will also find it difficult to take responsibility for protection. You must comply and implement this matter. We hereby notify you."</p>

<h3 id="e148">Common Sense for Treating Lung Disease <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>—Do Not Blindly Believe in the Delusion of Chemical Drugs to Kill Bacteria—</p>
<p>The lung disease medicines sold on the market today are numerous and countless. Their exaggerated claims of efficacy are all illusions after clinical trials, exposing their complete ineffectiveness. However, many lung disease patients are deceived by them, leading to delays in proper treatment and putting themselves in an incurable situation.</p>
<p>The pathogen of pulmonary tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus. Those with a little scientific knowledge generally know this. This bacterium has extremely strong resistance, and it is not easy to eradicate with any drug. Although the progress of modern medicine is rapid, there is still no specific drug that can directly kill the tubercle bacillus. Our principle of treating tuberculosis is to increase the body's resistance and indirectly cure the disease, not to directly kill the bacteria.</p>
<p>Although there are many drugs that can directly kill tubercle bacilli in test tubes in chemical laboratories, they all have strong toxicity. If they are used in the human body, the human body will inevitably suffer great damage before the tubercle bacilli are killed. Moreover, drugs, whether taken internally or injected, must pass through blood vessels and circulate throughout the body to the lesion to exert their effect. However, the tuberculosis lesion is in a corner of the lung tissue and has no blood vessels. Even if there is a safe bactericidal drug, its efficacy cannot be manifested. In other words, the place where the pathogens multiply cannot be reached by the drug. Therefore, the unreliability of the effect of such chemical drugs on tubercle bacilli in the body is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Development of the Latest Treatment for Lung Disease <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>—Internal Use of Organ Preparations is Definitely the Most Practical and Reasonable Based on Evidence—</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is also known as consumption. Its pathogen is the tubercle bacillus (i.e., tubercle). After this bacterium invades the lungs, it proliferates and grows in the lungs, causing induration. Hence the name pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The reason why tubercle bacilli (tubercle) are not easy to eradicate has been mentioned above. Then how can lung disease be cured? There is no other way but to rely on the body's natural defenses. White blood cells trap the tubercle bacilli mass, and connective tissue is formed outside it to form a dike, building a strong defense line, preventing the bacteria from breaking out and cutting off its food supply. After that, the bacteria die. Therefore, given the tenacious vitality of tubercle bacilli, it is not enough to control its death without our natural defense mechanism. Therefore, modern scholars generally believe that the only way to treat lung disease lies in the changes in physiological defense function, that is, the division of victory or defeat in the war between the body and the bacteria.</p>
<p>Fighting tubercle bacilli (tubercle) by surrounding the tuberculosis lesions and waiting for the enemy to destroy themselves is the best strategy. Therefore, the natural cure of pulmonary tuberculosis is also based on this principle. If we want to achieve the purpose of curing lung disease, we should understand the wonderful mechanism of this natural therapy and use it as a strategy for response. This iron army of response is organ therapy. Among the organ preparations that have been praised by doctors around the world, only "Fei Huo" dhith Weal has a definite basis and is practically effective.</p>
<p>If lung disease patients suffer from the disease for a long time, the function of these natural defenses declines and resistance is weakened. As a result, the bacteria spread rampantly, as if entering an uninhabited land, and lung disease continues to progress, eventually being killed by tubercle bacilli. Therefore, to eradicate tubercle bacilli and cure lung disease, we must use human assistance to improve the body's defense function and strengthen resistance. In this way, we can overcome the bacteria and achieve the purpose of recovery. However, this method of enhancing defense function cannot be achieved by any initial chemical drugs. Only the organ preparation "Fei Huo" dhith Weal has this special effect.</p>
<p>"Fei Huo" dhith Weal is made by mixing internal secretions - hormones - extracted from the fresh lungs and spleen of strong and healthy animals. After oral administration, its function can revive the atrophied lung function, promote its resistance, and make the physiological natural healing function vigorous, increase connective tissue cells, and fill in the defects in its organization. At the same time, it builds a solid connective tissue wall around the diseased area, hardening it and promoting the combination of scars, completely wrapping the evil tubercle bacilli (tubercle) and prohibiting its activities. It will eventually completely eliminate it, leading to recovery. Therefore, after patients take "Fei Huo" dhith Weal, they feel refreshed in a few days, their appetite increases, their sputum is thin and expectorated, and their cough decreases. Fever, night sweats, and hemoptysis disappear. If they continue to take it, and pay attention to general hygiene therapy, it can indeed be completely cured in a very short period of time. Therefore, since the discovery of this organ therapy, the chemical drug therapy that has dominated for many years has now been abandoned by the treatment community and is about to be eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Nocturnal Emission That Reduces Youthful Vigor and Shortens Life <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. H.W. Robert, Translated by Dr. Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>——Understanding the Three Steps of the Treatment Process——</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is a symptom of sexual neurasthenia. There are very few cases where nocturnal emission occurs alone. Speaking of the causes of sexual neurasthenia, most are the result of excessive sexual activity and masturbation. There is also a type of chronic gonorrhea that reaches the posterior urethra, prostate, and ejaculatory ducts. Because of the inflammation, reflective ejaculation is triggered, which becomes the cause of nocturnal emission. This is also common. Therefore, people who have suffered from gonorrhea often experience nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation (i.e., ejaculation within a short period of intercourse).</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission at night is mostly ejaculation caused by dreams. This is called wet dream. The penis is mostly erect. Sometimes, if there is no pleasure and the penis is not erect, there may also be leakage of semen. This is called spermatorrhea. It is different from nocturnal emission. There are also cases where nocturnal emission occurs during the day due to slight stimulation of the genitals or emotional stimulation. This is called seeing-color spermatorrhea or daytime nocturnal emission. There is also leakage of semen from the urethra during urination and defecation. This type is not caused by erotic excitement and is also a type of spermatorrhea (commonly known as slippery semen). If a small amount of milky white liquid is discharged from the urethra when not defecating, this is called prostatic fluid leakage. It is not semen. It is a secretion of the prostate. Chronic diseases invading the prostate often cause such prostatic fluid leakage and spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>The result of nocturnal emission is mostly fatigue, lack of energy, unclear mind, and aversion to work. Students are also unwilling to study hard. Headache, heaviness in the head, and memory and thinking power are all felt to be declining. Generally, they fall into depression and eventually become severe neurasthenia—forgetfulness, insomnia, and emaciation. The functions of various parts of the body decline, and there is a lack of resistance to various diseases. Therefore, people who suffer from excessive nocturnal emission are prone to tuberculosis. This is why.</p>
<p>People who suffer from nocturnal emission should know that nocturnal emission is a symptom of sexual neurasthenia. If you want to be cured, you should naturally seek treatment for neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The first step of treatment is to find a way to plug the hole and not let it lose another drop of precious semen. Use tonics to strengthen the essence and nourish the kidneys at any time to replenish the lost vitality. This can be regarded as a fundamental treatment method to reverse all crises.</p>
<p>Although there are many types of medicines for treating nocturnal emission on the market, those that are effective are as rare as phoenix feathers. The efficacy of those sperm-locking pills is weak, so let's not talk about them. Moreover, the side effects of those pills are very serious. Often, after taking them, before the efficacy is seen, side effects such as headache, stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, and constipation appear first. Therefore, delaying the disease and preventing cure has been seen many times.</p>
<p>According to my clinical experience, the treatment process should be divided into three steps. The first step is to take "Fulang" pills Fonan to stop the leakage (swallow three pills every night before going to bed. It usually takes two bottles to recover completely). The second step is to use tonics to strengthen the essence and nourish the kidneys. "Huan Ertong" Well Tonic made from testicles and essence is the most effective. After taking this product, all symptoms of impotence and premature ejaculation caused by kidney deficiency (i.e., so-called reproductive dysfunction) can be quickly cured. There will naturally be a happy harvest for the couple's sex life. The third step is to strengthen the nervous system. Because nocturnal emission is mostly caused by neurasthenia, nerve tonics must be used. Ordinary tonics on the market (such as cod liver oil iron, phosphorus, calcium, etc.) are absolutely ineffective. Only "Mimir Brain Tonic Juice" Memory Neurotic has this special effect. According to reports from clinical users, after taking this product, all the symptoms of weakness in people suffering from neurasthenia disappear quickly. They feel clear-headed, refreshed, energetic, and have increased energy. The functions of all parts of the body are lively and vigorous, like the joy of a new life coming to the world again.</p>
<p>Author's note——Patients must take the above three medicines at the same time, and not in any particular order. Moreover, these medicines are all very mild in nature, without any drawbacks. They are extremely safe. It is very convenient for patients to buy and take them on their own. The efficacy is very significant, which is certainly not comparable to other similar medicines.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Verified Case Studies of Radical Cure for Asthma <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>First Case: Mr. Zhu, 46 years old (Businessman), residing in Huaxing Lane, Hongkou, Shanghai</p>
<p>The patient was originally in good health. Since the winter before last, he has been suffering from phlegm-based asthma. He often felt chest tightness and heart palpitations. Every one or two weeks, he would have a severe asthma attack. During the attack, his breathing became extremely difficult, his face turned purplish-blue, and he was drenched in cold sweat. However, after a short period, once he coughed up thick, sticky phlegm, he would gradually recover. He had taken various asthma medications available on the market, some of which provided temporary relief, while others had no effect at all, and in fact, the attacks became more frequent. The patient was in great distress. After my diagnosis, it was determined he was suffering from cardiac asthma. On the one hand, I instructed him to pay attention to his health and avoid catching a cold. On the other hand, I instructed him to purchase and take "Holipin" tablets continuously. After finishing half a dozen bottles, he claimed to be completely cured. It has been nearly five months since he started taking the medication, and he has not had a single attack. This shows that this product truly has a radical curative effect on asthma.</p>
<p>Second Case: Mr. Zhang, 29 years old, from Hangzhou (Academic), residing on Fangbang Road, within this city</p>
<p>This patient's constitution has been weak since childhood (what is known as being "nervous"). His chest development was poor. Since the age of nine, he has had tracheitis. His cough varied from severe to mild. He usually had mild difficulty in breathing. Whenever the weather changed from cold to warm or vice versa, he would have a severe asthma attack. Thus, his work was greatly affected. He came to see me in June of this year. After diagnosis, it was determined to be bronchial asthma, with a mild catarrah in the apex of the lung (i.e., early-stage pulmonary tuberculosis). Therefore, I instructed him to follow general health care methods and to purchase and take "Phith Wcal." With these two medications, he was treated continuously for only two months, and his chronic illness completely disappeared. Moreover, his lungs became stronger and his body healthier. The patient was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Third Case: Mr. Cai, 52 years old, Worker, residing on Taiping Bridge, Nanjing</p>
<p>This person suffered from bronchitis five years ago due to a cold. Subsequently, he developed asthma. It would improve and then recur, and has not been completely cured to this day. Recently, due to overwork, the number of attacks has increased, and the symptoms are also more severe. He also stated that asthma attacks often occurred at night. Initially, he felt chest tightness and difficulty in breathing, which gradually worsened. There was a sound like snoring or a flute in his throat. He could not lie down, coughed and wheezed, was drenched in cold sweat, and his face was pale, a very dangerous state. After several hours, he coughed up thick, white, foamy phlegm, and then felt relieved. He came for treatment this spring. After diagnosis, it was determined to be bronchial asthma. I instructed him to loosen his chest clothing during an attack to allow for air circulation and to take three "Holipin" tablets at once. After fifty minutes, the chest tightness and wheezing were noticeably relieved. After another two hours, he continued to take two more tablets. The next morning, the chest tightness and wheezing had completely disappeared, with no unpleasant side effects. Later, in order to seek a radical cure, the patient continuously took "Holipin" for three months. His asthma and cough, which had lasted for years, were completely cured. He claims that he has not had an attack since the cure.</p>
<p>Fourth Case: Boy, named Zhu. Currently 14 years old. Residing in the South City of this city.</p>
<p>This child has been suffering from a cough for a year that has not healed. He currently has rapid breathing. With slight movement, he gets asthma. He is weak. Whenever the weather suddenly changes to windy and cold, the illness becomes particularly severe.</p>
<p>Diagnosed with bronchial asthma. He was prescribed two medications. One was "Holipin" to treat his asthma. The other was "Phith Wcal" to treat his chronic cough (i.e., chronic bronchitis). They were taken together. After about two and a half months, the child and his father came to my office to thank me. According to them, he has completely recovered.</p>
<p>Fifth Case: Mr. Gu. 42 years old. Residing in the West Gate of this city.</p>
<p>The person was physically weak and suffered from bronchitis with coughing the year before last. Subsequently, he developed asthma. It would come and go. He often felt tightness and discomfort in his chest, and his breathing was not smooth. Furthermore, he coughed up a lot of phlegm but could not expel it. He had difficulty breathing, especially at midnight. It took two to three hours for it to subside. He had received medical treatment and injections many times, but they were mostly only temporarily effective. He did not achieve a complete cure. Because of this, he was in great pain.</p>
<p>Diagnosed with bronchial asthma. I instructed him to strictly adhere to health maintenance. He was prohibited from consuming stimulating foods. He was prescribed “Holipin” and “Phith Wcal” two medications. After three months of continuous consumption, he was completely cured. It has not been seen to recur.</p>
<p>Sixth Case: Mr. Hua. 53 years old. Residing on Jiaxing Road, within this city</p>

<p>— Physician Chen Hezhen (Female)</p>
<p>Menstruation is a significant matter for women themselves. Menstrual pain—is also a woman's difficult pain. The painful menstruation during the virgin period—is excessive menstruation. Menstrual abnormalities etc. Especially in modern times, where the number of working women going out into the streets is gradually increasing. The suffering of women with this menstrual disorder has become more profound and has increased. Menstrual stagnation. Excessive menstruation. Irregular menstruation, etc. are almost always associated with some cause--especially diseases related to female venereal diseases.</p>
<p>Menstrual pain--usually involves some dull pain in the lower back during menstruation. Everyone has experienced this. But this pain is very severe--just like the labor pain during childbirth. It occurs in the sacral region before menstruation. With the flow of menstrual blood, that labor-like pain gradually eases somewhat. By the end of menstruation. That pain disappears like labor pains.</p>
<p>Editor's Note—Menstruation is one of the most important things for adult women to pay attention to. It is not only related to the health of the body. Furthermore, it affects fertility. Therefore, the darkness or lightness of the color, the timing before or after, all have a significant relationship. Abdominal pain during menstruation is especially not to be ignored.

<p>— Physician Gu Zigao</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and leukorrhea are very easily transmitted and very difficult to cure. In recent years, it has become very rampant among venereal diseases. If one is unfortunately infected with it. It will improve and recur, lingering for a lifetime. Although there are now various medications for treating gonorrhea. However, they can only be temporarily effective. A medicine that can truly eliminate gonorrhea and radically cure the source of the disease is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. This is a matter of regret for general clinical physicians. Recently, Dr. H.S. Puch, after several years of painstaking research and thorough experimentation. Has invented a new internal disinfectant. It is called 918 ANTI-GONO-TAB. (Translated as 918 Leukorrhea Tablets). This product has strong penetration and perfect sterilization effects. It can eradicate the pathogenic bacteria hidden deep inside. It is the only holy product for the treatment of acute and chronic gonorrhea. Moreover, it does not have any side effects. This is a special feature of this medicine. Since I started using it, I have achieved remarkable results. I am sure that it has value that can be promoted.</p>
<p>Editor's note—'918 Leukorrhea Tablets' 918 Anti-Gono-Tab. is managed by Shanghai Meilindeng Pharmaceutical Company. Each bottle contains fifty tablets. The list price is two yuan.</p>

The location issue will be decided in Warsaw in the second week of June 1937. However, the reception committee will meet in Lausanne before that date.</p>

The founder of the association, Klen, reported on the purpose of holding the competition, which is to encourage the cultivation of physique, intelligence, courage, and skill. Although this type of sport is common in Europe and America, it is still a pioneering effort to hold it in China. Therefore, the field equipment is not very comprehensive. The cars used in the competition are also not limited to cars specifically designed for competition, in order to show universality. Fortunately, they were able to obtain the approval of the municipal government and were able to hold the event at the Yangshupu Yinxiang Port Racecourse, which is very grateful. At the same time, they plan to set up a car exhibition at the venue to collect all kinds of cars and display them at the venue to enhance the grand occasion. As for the competition schedule, it is currently set as three car races, three motorcycle races, two men's cycling races, and one women's cycling race. The qualifications for competitors are limited to amateurs. Professional athletes will be excluded. There is no limit to nationality. Chinese and foreign men and women can join as competitors. However, the cars must be self-provided. After the association sends personnel to inspect the equipment, they can participate. The physical fitness must also be checked to determine acceptance. The prizes will be donated by all walks of life and are being contacted by all parties. In order to limit the crowding of the audience, seats will be set up in the racecourse and admission tickets will be charged. The ticket prices are set at four types: five yuan, three yuan, one yuan, and five cents. 15% of the ticket income will be used as the China Aviation Construction Association's funds or to purchase airplanes to celebrate Jiang's birthday. Competitors can contact the association's office from next week to register. This competition is still a pioneering effort in China and is expected to be warmly welcomed by Chinese and foreign people at that time.</p>

<p>(Tokyo Communication) China has been promoting compulsory education for the past year, and has made considerable progress. Japan is also implementing compulsory education at the same time. Japan takes primary schools as compulsory education, which is the same meaning as China taking short-term primary schools as compulsory education. Regarding the issue of Japan's education funding, it has now been resolved. The expenses that were previously borne by the city, town, and village residents, totaling 136 million yuan, have now been completely abolished and will be borne by the state. The majority of this is for compulsory education and primary school teachers' salaries. The national compulsory education and primary school education expenses in Japan are 175 million yuan, which are now also completely borne by the state. In the future, the Ministry of Education (equivalent to China's Ministry of Education) will have greater responsibilities and greater authority to guide compulsory education. China's compulsory education funding stipulated last year that the local government would pay half and the central government would subsidize the other half. Those who are concerned about this education can refer to Japan's compulsory funding. (Qin)</p>

However, as many school lands in various counties had been encroached upon, concealed, or abandoned for many years, resulting in loss and difficulty in investigation, it also revised measures for clearing school lands and rectifying school rents (including methods for surveying, measuring, mapping, etc.). Furthermore, supplementary methods for clearing school lands and rectifying school rents were drafted and designated as one of the central tasks when the administrative guidelines for the 24th year were issued to various counties. Simultaneously, special commissioners for inspecting school property were dispatched to various counties to conduct on-site inspections and formulate appropriate rectification plans based on the previous abuses of school property in each county, ordering guidance and implementation. After repeated urging and rectification, the school property in various counties has achieved significant results, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Gaoyou, Shiying, Yancheng, Dangshan, and Si County have used the revenue from rectification to repurchase school lands that had been mortgaged. (2) After rectification, Yancheng increased its rental income by approximately 10,000 yuan in the 24th year. (3) The disputes over school property in Funing were significant, but after rectification, it has become quite stable. (4) Gaoyou increased its school land by over 300 mu (purchased with compensation from the former Education Bureau Chief, Qiu). (5) After rectification in Liyang, the opening of the Sanda Polder can increase revenue by tens of thousands of yuan annually. (6) After rectification in Guanyun, all school property in the city and townships has been taken over by the Bureau, and the phenomenon of manipulation and disputes has been eliminated. (7) Huaian has just begun rectification, and it is estimated that the school rent revenue for the 25th year will increase by 10,000 yuan compared to the previous year. (8) Tongshan and Pei County have completed rectification, but unfortunately suffered from the Yellow River flood, and rent payments could not be collected in full. However, the abuses have been eliminated. (9) Other counties, such as Yangzhou and Lianshui, have also implemented surveys of school property and submitted maps for record. At a time when national compulsory education is being implemented, the central government deeply understands the difficulties of the people and is raising substantial funds for subsidies. Local governments should also find ways to reorganize the sources of education funding in order to discuss major plans and achieve early success. However, considering the current social and economic situation, excessive and miscellaneous taxes should be abolished, and the people's capacity to bear burdens should not be exceeded. The current plan is to reorganize the school property allocated to education expenses in various counties, which can provide some support. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has instructed the heads of various county bureaus to work together to achieve the goal of thorough reorganization.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly experienced drastic changes in the market, with a very fierce drop. The sudden incident in Hongkou happened on the last day of September futures, and the market was squeezed, resulting in extreme intensity. In addition, the outflow of spot goods and market rumors that someone in the financial world sold off made people feel even more panicked. Even the numbers that had always been very stable sold off in large quantities at this point, such as 11, 43, and 54. Either bulls were coming out of their cages, or spot goods were flowing out. The dull situation turned into an extremely active market. It is difficult to predict how the future will evolve. Today, only one month of October futures will be traded, and the fluctuations in the market should be slightly reduced. According to the dealers, the morning opening for this month's E bond fell slightly, with some bears offsetting, but the distant contracts could not support it and quickly fell by a small 0.7 yuan.

After entering, number 43 slightly covered shorts, and types A and B were slightly better by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The closing was suddenly distorted due to the enthusiastic buying by numbers 32, 33, and 4 of the Unified E and D bonds, and the short covering trend rose, rebounding by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The recent rise in the D bond was good by 0.95 yuan. However, after the Unified C, numbers 54 and 11 continued to sell off in large amounts, and the market turned weak again. Rumors resurfaced, and people became even more panicked. Unified B and A fell by another 0.25 to 0.6 yuan. As a result of the closing, the previous results plummeted by 0.75 to 1.5 yuan. 96 also fell slightly by 0.4 yuan. The total number of transactions was 17.68 million yuan.

<h3 id="e180">Gauze Flowers: Spot Sales Active, Gauze Market's Decline Slows, Many Eager to Buy on Dips <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The gauze market is calm, but the trend is good, and sentiment is unusually enthusiastic, with most people bullish. This is due to the lively spot gauze sales, the gradual movement of gauze from warehouses, and the market's adoption of a "buy on dips" strategy for cotton yarn. However, the overseas gauze flower market situation is remarkably dull. It is said that there is some negative sentiment within, tending towards selling.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Standard Gauze Opens with a Dip <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the standard gauze market this morning, prices for all months showed a decline. Due to [unspecified] events, sentiment was poor, and floating accounts sold off, weakening momentum. Prices fell by five, six, or seven jiao for near-term months and one yuan for distant months. After the second session, it was heard that spot gauze sales remained strong, buying interest revived, and market prices rebounded. It was observed that the willingness to sell was strong from Xincheng [Trustworthy], Deda [Great Virtue], Hexing [Harmonious Prosperity], Gengfeng [Perpetual Abundance], and Fukang [Blessing and Health], while Yuda [Great Abundance] also covered short positions significantly. Xingchang [Prosperous Chang], Huamao [Magnificent China], and Xiacheng [Harmonious Achievement] all bought in. By the close, the market situation was ordinary. As a result, the closing prices for each month of standard gauze were down three, four, or six jiao compared to the previous month's closing prices. In the afternoon session, the market appeared flat, with distant contracts weaker. After the second session, it was heard that spot gauze business still involved over 2,000 bales, and sentiment revived. As a result, near-term months rose three to five jiao compared to the morning closing price, while distant months remained unchanged. It was observed that Deda sold 2,850 bales, Tongji [Universal Record] 800 bales, Mingde [Bright Virtue] 1,350 bales, Hexing 1,050 bales, Gengfeng 1,600 bales, Runkang [Moist Health] 1,150 bales, Fukang 1,150 bales, Xincheng 5,000 bales, Juxing [Gathering Prosperity] 500 bales, and Shenji [Careful Record] 1,500 bales. Yuda bought 5,100 bales, Dafu [Great Prosperity] 650 bales, Xingchang 1,650 bales, Huamao 1,850 bales, Taichang [Peaceful Chang] 1,550 bales, Xiacheng 1,400 bales, Gengfeng 2,400 bales, and Dachang [Great Chang] 900 bales. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Gauze Sales Improve, Prices Also Rise <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Spot gauze sales have improved. It was found that various groups purchased a total of 1,025 bales of current and future contracts throughout the day, and prices rose by one yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below: Changsha 295, Guangdong 750, Inland 275, Jiangxi 50, Tianjin 150, Shantou 55, Yunnan 170, Fellow Traders 300.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Cotton Mills Continuously Purchase, Cotton Market Falls and Rises Again <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose again, mainly because gauze sales improved, and mills continued to purchase raw materials. As a result, the spot cotton situation became firmer. However, some people, due to favorable weather conditions, expect a further increase in cotton production, which will inevitably lead to a congested supply in the future. Therefore, there are quite a few people who sell when prices rise.</p>
<h3 id="e184">This Month's Flower Grade is Unusually Tight <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the standard flower market, the market atmosphere was very weak because U.S. cotton initially rose and then fell, and Indian cotton also softened, falling 0.25 rupees. Osaka's Third Grade cotton fell 1.2 jiao. This was mainly because the recent weather has been sunny, and there are still hopes for increased new cotton production. As a result, sellers were very active, and the gauze market also declined. At the opening of the first session, prices for all months fell sharply by three to four and a half jiao. The second session rebounded slightly. It was observed that Hexing, Minghua [Bright China], Fukang, Xincheng, Yuanxingchang [Original Prosperous Chang], and Jinchang [Brocade Chang] sold, while Changhe [Long Harmony], Xinchang, Xiacheng, Changyu [Long Surplus], Huamao, and Yikang [Beneficial Health] covered short positions. As a result, the closing prices for each month of standard flower were down one and a half to two or three jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. In the afternoon session, the October contract was quite tight, pulling up distant months. After the second session, in view of the good gauze market, buying interest revived, and as a result, prices for all months rose one to two and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was observed that Xincheng sold 6,200 dan [a unit of weight], Fukang 3,600 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,200 dan, Mingde 1,400 dan, Changji [Prosperous Record] 1,300 dan, Changfeng [Long Abundance] 2,400 dan, Minghua 1,700 dan, Deda 3,700 dan, Tongji 2,700 dan, Gengfeng bought 7,500 dan, Huamao 2,600 dan, Changyu 2,000 dan, Runkang 8,600 dan, Xiacheng 1,600 dan, Changhe 11,400 dan, and Shenji 1,100 dan. The daily high and low prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>Spot cotton consumption is active, and mills have strong demand. It is said that the source of Yao cotton is 6,000 bales, and Tong cotton is 880 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e186">U.S. Cotton Experiences a Cotton Hoarding Movement <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened with good news from Liverpool. Foreign firms and brokers bought, and prices for all months rose three to seven points. Cotton farmers were slow to hedge, and weekly weather reports were ignored. The ginned cotton report showed a large increase in quantity, indicating that early cotton movement was still smooth. According to speculation, half of the cotton could be ginned before October 1st. Current demand is active, and it is reported that a cotton hoarding movement has occurred in Memphis, Texas, which has strengthened prices. Later, cotton farmers hedged, and market prices softened again. At the close, New Orleans sold off, and market prices weakened further. Spot prices rose one point, and futures prices fell three points to rise one point. U.K. spot cotton rose four points, and futures rose six points. Indian cotton merchants hedged Pinguer and Oumula, and bulls closed positions. European exporters and speculators bought. Pinguer rose 0.25 rupees, Oumula fell 0.25 rupees, and Bai Luoqi remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated 23rd)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 24th was: Bai Luoqi at 215.5 rupees, down 1.25 rupees; Oumula at 191 rupees, down 1 rupee; Pinguele at 152 rupees, down 1 rupee.</p>

<p>Third grade futures gauze fell 0.2 jiao to rise 1.3 yuan. Near-term was 213 yuan, and distant was 202.3 yuan. Futures cotton rose 0.5 jiao to fall 0.05 yuan. Near-term was 64.55 yuan, and distant was 63.7 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market trend remained good. Customers urgently needed spot goods of seasonal piece goods. Most of the October and November futures for fine twill, coarse cloth, grey cloth, floral velvet, Zhigong [a type of cloth], Piji [another type of cloth], flannel, and velvet cloth from Chinese and foreign factories have already been sold out. Demand exceeds supply for spot goods, and goods from Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian, and inland areas continue to arrive, making the market prices for all goods more stable. Yesterday, Yunnan purchased over 300 pieces of Zhigong, Piji, Shilin cloth [a type of dyed cloth], large red cotton velvet, floral velvet, crepe velvet, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. Fujian buyers were even more active, and the street observed a shortage of heavy unbleached coarse cloth, absorbing over 600 pieces of coarse cloth from factories such as Ewo [Jardine Matheson]. Military uniform buyers and Shandong buyers from the northern route also purchased heavy coarse cloth, 200 to 400 pieces of Siping Lotus Earth and other brands. Inland buyers and dyeing factories purchased over 300 pieces of Dong goods fine cloth, and the delivery of various printed piece goods and plain fine twill from Chinese and foreign factories was still very busy. Few new transactions were made due to prior orders.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Autumn Goods Move, Yuanfang Goods Prices Only Rise, No Fall <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Thursday, Yuanfang Foreign Firm held its 3008th auction, displaying five types of goods: Western silk, velvet, Gongni [a type of woolen fabric], silk floss, and foreign red cloth. There were a total of 77 boxes of Western brand goods. There were also four types of goods: bleached fine cloth, poplin, and foreign blue cloth, but they were not included because no goods had arrived from overseas. The asking price market was quite strong, with only rises and no falls. Taixi [Italian] silk, plus the Beiji [Arctic] brand, was highly sought after due to a long absence of goods, and the prices of other brands rose by about one fen per yard. Velvet and Gongni both saw slight increases. The customer base for feather silk was strong due to the autumn trade in inland areas. The auction was advantageous, with the Cai Bashi [Colorful Eight] brand rising in price by one yuan, one jiao, and half. The other Renqiu [Human Ball], Zhulin [Bamboo Forest], Haitian [Sea Sky], Shibazi [Eighteen Sons], Eryuan [Two Yuan], and Dibozishu [Duke of Theber] brands rose by around six jiao, while the Wuxing [Five Stars], Cile [Benevolent Joy], Andian [Peaceful Palace], Baoyan [Precious Swallow], and Guogong [Duke of State] brands rose by four or five jiao, and the rest rose by one or two jiao. The price of six-pound foreign red cloth was still advantageous.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Grain: Delivery Approaches, Flour and Wheat Near-Term Strong, Distant-Term Falls <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The flour market's ups and downs were based on reports from foreign wheat, with no significant benchmark. There was a lot of floating profit, and many people took advantage of the higher prices on the previous day to sell. However, large non-industry accounts had no interest in buying due to the fall in public bonds. Therefore, prices for all distant months fell across the board. However, trading for this month ends today, and both longs and shorts closed positions early. Initially, the current demand was still strong, and the market also trended downward. Subsequently, shorts covered their positions, and the amount of stock gradually became scarce. Therefore, this month's contract suddenly rose by more than two fen in the afternoon, showing a slight squeeze on shorts. However, raw materials remained strong, and sellers lacked active moves, so the temporary position may be stable. The whole day resulted in a near-term strong, distant-term weak situation. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the current month rose one fen, one li, and half, October remained unchanged, November fell two and a half li, December fell seven and a half li, January fell one fen and seven and a half li, and February fell one fen.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday morning, overseas wheat telegraphs reported that Chicago fell four points for near-term and 1/2 point for distant-term. Chicago was down slightly four points for near-term, up slightly four points for distant-term, and Liverpool rose 1 penny. Overseas market conditions had no major impact, but with public bonds falling and the flour market also declining, purchasing was hindered, and scattereds followed suit, gradually depressing the market. However, the spot wheat Yunhua [shipping company] was still good, and there was little interest in delivering the current month, so the amount of stock gradually recovered, resulting in a near-term rise and distant-term fall. The whole day's result was that the current month rose one fen, October fell four fen, November and February each fell two fen, and December and January each fell slightly one fen. The spot wheat market remained strong, with Yingzhou and other high wheat still opening at 5.15 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 7,000 bags, with Shenda [Shanghai Great] taking in 5,000 bags and Fufeng [Abundant Harvest] taking in 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e192">River Rice Route Shows Slight Activity <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were similar to before, with a total of 34 or 35 numbers arriving, totaling 3,000 shi [a unit of volume]. The street's sales market was moving but not smooth. Baosao [a type of rice] was more active than before. Qingdao gangs purchased over 700 bags of Borpo and over 300 bags of Baige, so the market seemed to have a turning point. However, because the inner fatigue has been long-standing, it is probably not easy to revive suddenly. Although new Japonica and Baige and other new Bo rice have arrived in increasing quantities, the market has only depreciated slightly by one jiao. New Liaoyang and other sharp points showed a high and stable, second-soft situation. Even the new Yin Qian Yuan [silver thousand yuan] had no glory or disgrace, and thick early-season broken goods were rare and maintained their original prices. Borpo was similar to the previous market, Baosao was stable, and Yunhua continued to decline by a jiao or so. In short, in the overall trend, at this time of the day of emerging new, it is difficult to seek improvement. However, as prices are increasingly depressed, customer sales and store reserves may be slightly smoother, which is also not impossible.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty numbers of river gangs below had good spot sales of rice, broken japonica, changed yuan, and various sharp points. Bo rice and Dongxin were ordinary. Market prices for broken japonica, changed yuan, and new Bu sharp points were strong. The price of Bo rice was reduced by one or two jiao, and the price of Dongxin Japonica was slightly one jiao. New Yangquan Du sharp, Jiaobai Xian, and new Ke sharp and so on remained stable. This new Japonica was fatigued by several fen to nearly one jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai silk market remained tight as before, and domestic and foreign silk sales remained stagnant. Although sentiment weakened slightly in the afternoon, there was no significant change. Recently, white mills' sales prices have risen by about 30 yuan compared to before, and manufacturers' prices have risen by about 50 yuan. The opinions of Europe, America, and domestic sales are the same. Yesterday, the near-term silk prices in New York and Yokohama were both tight and stable as before, while distant-term fell slightly by half a point and five yuan, respectively. Only 90 bales were traded in the Shanghai silk market, and prices remained the same as before, but the market atmosphere has weakened slightly.</p>

<p>Since Wan and Gan black tea have jointly decided on the overall sales plan, the situation has already greatly improved yesterday. British trading firms, in view of the fact that the tea in the market is likely to be entirely bought up by Wang Yutai, have issued emergency telegrams and received replies. Jinlong Foreign Firm rushed in over 3,000 boxes, and Xiehe absorbed 1,600 or 1,700 boxes. Ewo, Tianyu, and Mazhi Near and other firms also purchased. Over 5,000 boxes were sold throughout the day, and the fixed price was higher than Wang Yutai's by three or four yuan to two yuan. There are only about 2,000 boxes left in the market, which can be sold out completely. This situation is unprecedented.</p>

<p>Yesterday, only domestic crude red sugar was selling relatively well in the sugar market, while the rest remained stable. At the public association market, the spot price of 24 coarse sand white sugar was 21.5 yuan, down 0.05 yuan. The re-export price was 6.55 yuan, unchanged. Dong white numbers 489 and this factory's cotton white were not light or high. At the number market, the Chao gang opened a batch of cotton red, such as over 60 bags of Dingshang Bingchang red at 16.25 yuan, up about 0.3 yuan. There were also 23 pieces of Dali at 15.7 yuan, 69 bags of Yongchang flipped red at 14.7 yuan, and 41 bags of sub-village flipped red at 14 yuan.</p>

<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>It's evening, and there's still not a bit of wind. Stepping out of the printing house, the scorching steam still rushes at my nose. There are particularly many cars out for a spin in the evening. The bright Shell and Socony signs squint dreamily. I take a breath: the ink smell from the typesetting room has been replaced by the even more unpleasant gasoline.</p>
<p>I hurry back along the sidewalk, with not a trace of imagination in my head. A day's work has made me forget everything, leaving only this bit of hunger, which constantly suggests, protesting to me.</p>
<p>Under a street lamp, I received a heavy blow on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Hey, it's you! How many years has it been, how many years—" The speaker was clearly surrounded by a sudden surge of excitement, a bit breathless. The nose, thin and particularly tall for a middle-aged man, was the clearest marker: wasn't that my distant uncle who was in the silk business?</p>
<p>"Big Nose, are you here to sell goods again?" I shook his thin, blue-veined hand. However, because they were hidden in long sleeves all year round, they were white and皙. I didn't have time to see if the wedding ring from seven years ago still had its former charm on that white hand.</p>
<p>He wasn't surprised at all by the impolite nickname and laughed innocently, but quickly collected himself: "Wild child, what are you running around for all day? Don't you miss home? Now that you're so close, you don't even come back to see, you could at least come visit Uncle Big Nose!"</p>
<p>I turned around and pointed to the place I had just come out of, telling him that it was where I worked.</p>
<p>"Be careful of your lungs!" He suddenly warned me with concern. He still remembered my congenital deficiency.</p>
<p>I didn't answer him for a moment, just kept walking with him towards my home. When we reached a car dealership on the corner, Big Nose's eyes flashed, and he casually read the signs on the large glass window.</p>
<p>"1936, hmm, a very difficult year! So many bizarre things have come out:" He seemed to have a flash of inspiration, touching on the depression in his heart, and sighed:</p>
<p>"Do you know? Our landlord, Master Han the Fourth, hanged himself! That opium addict, because of two years of empty fields, couldn't be a small landlord anymore. He started selling the house, and last year the county chased him to pay taxes. He ran and ran, avoiding the wind. But what about food? There was even still black rice to eat! That middle-aged fellow just last month——."</p>
<p>"Damn it all! These obstacles of the vigorous, the middle-aged, the old, their fates are all the same, sooner or later you'll see! Hey, didn't Master Han the Fourth's young wife take out a teaching diploma from her dowry chest to become a primary school teacher?" I grabbed this bit of history from my vague memories.</p>
<p>Big Nose patted my shoulder: "Good girl, it's wrong to say you have no conscience towards your hometown, you remember everything. Hmm, that young lady who's a teacher? A primary school teacher with twenty yuan a month can't do much to support Master Han the Fourth. That woman has a lot of ideas, she's also smart. She taught for half a year with a lot of energy, and in the end she took all three children away, telling the opium addict: 'I'm taking the children, you take care of yourself!' You see, that was a clean break, without money, the opium addict couldn't throw his weight around……"</p>
<p>We stepped over the piles of people on the sidewalk. People had closed the narrow doors of their homes and run to the street to cool off. The homeless men and children found dark corners to lie down and rest, often getting hit with a stick or a shoe in their dreams.</p>
<p>"These days!" Big Nose looked at the piles of people with worry, as if afraid that one day this misfortune, this suffering, would weigh on him. He had a slight cold premonition, and the middle-aged man's gloom deepened day by day. He had heard the news of losses at their shop, and at the end of the year there was a shortage of working capital, almost forcing them to close.</p>
<p>"Think about who makes us live these days! Uncle, do you know about the roar of the peasants in the suburbs of our hometown recently? In the future——" I can't forget the recent historical materials of my hometown, which are the only things that excite me. The feeders of the fat pigs that have been buried underground for many years are also rising up.</p>
<p>A burst of childish enthusiasm made me look at the dark sky. It will be bright tomorrow, won't it? So I puffed out my chest.</p>
<p>"That, it's too wild, but, it's also a reason, although a little sacrifice is needed…… The hometown has also changed, even in the teahouse, the loud laughter has been overwhelmed by some poor worries, everyone sighs in the manner of being drunk about the sweeping star that has overwhelmed paradise, counting down the helplessness of life, not many people have the spare money and leisure to call out to a ballad seller, or eat some eel noodles or shrimp dumplings. There are also fewer people organizing gambling games here: gambling and gambling is debt, no fun. It's really time to see this declining small town!"</p>
<p>I slowed down a little, ignoring his advice, and another thought came up:</p>
<p>"How many, cousins and younger siblings do I have? Big Nose!"</p>
<p>His sunken eyes moved: "Silly ghost, you've even forgotten this, what thin affection! But who's to blame? Your Big Nose aunt is too good at having children. By this winter, Little Five will be born soon. Our shop is worse every year, and at the end of the year there's not much bonus, the boss even wants to close down! He says we're 'eating together,' we can't get any good out of it, and we have to worry, it's also strange, silk at two mao a foot has few buyers, rayon, the immoral stuff, has squeezed the silk factories in our hometown to close their doors, piles of mulberry leaves watch them sprout and leaf on the trees, let them wither and fall to the ground! The clever ones have even dug up the roots!"</p>
<p>He poured out a bellyful of grievances as if he was letting out air: "Your aunt told me not to eat this bowl of rice anymore, to open a small shop happily, but women really don't understand the difficulty. A big shop can't be opened, and a small shop isn't enough to live on. Do you know Zhu Laoer, who went from being an 'artist' (he said it with special emphasis, I know he means the one who used to set the scenery for the civilization troupe) to opening a grocery store? At first he was so impressive, traveling to the docks, speaking official language, but these days he's being squeezed for the rent of the small grocery store, borrowing from everywhere, but the year——" Big Nose faltered for a moment, "Isn't it harder to borrow money than for a rooster to lay an egg?"</p>
<p>"…… But, desperate measures, little by little people will……"</p>
<p>Big Nose immediately took over: "This Zhu Laoer has already jumped over the wall! That day the landlord found the police to force rent, saying he would break the counter if he didn't pay. The nearly fifty-year-old Zhu Laoer really got angry, pointing to his own pasteboard devices (this is an involuntary sideline, he's a scenery-builder!) and thrusting his fist to the police's hat: 'You want it, I'll give you this, I'll send you to the West! I'm telling you: you can't squeeze oil out of a stone!' Hey, my wild child, Zhu Laoer ate a series of slaps, his face flushed, grabbed a bench and……</p>
<p>(Zhu Laoer is a prominent figure on this street, he's traveled to the docks, been out of the province, how could he stand this!)"</p>
<p>Without him saying it, I had already guessed the result; "There's no telling how many years he'll be sentenced to, it's just that Zhu Laoer's wife is still making trouble with her children at the prison, wanting to serve her time together, she says that outside she has hands that can work but no food to eat, it's better to eat 'gravel rice' together……"</p>
<p>Big Nose's face flushed with excitement, I seemed to see it. The hand he was holding got hotter and hotter, I knew what kind of excitement was leaping in his heart. Finally, he tugged at his silk gown:</p>
<p>"There will be a time, Uncle Big Nose will take off this silk gown, really, do you believe it, wild thing? Really take it off——will you still pay attention to Uncle then?"</p>
<p>I was stunned by his innocent question. I happily said, "Why wouldn't I pay attention? Not only will I pay attention, but I'll also hold Big Nose's hand tightly and walk together, like today." I smiled comfortably.</p>
<p>Big Nose also smiled half-knowingly.</p>
<p>"We're home, are you coming in?" I stopped in front of a noisy alleyway.</p>
<p>"No," he looked at his watch, "it's too late, I was originally looking for a colleague, the store had some debts from when it closed, they called me to handle it. I'll go back tomorrow—"</p>
<p>Under the echo of his well-intentioned "You should come back and take a look too!" I took out the key to open the back door.</p>
<p>A bit of annoyance, a bit of surprise, a bit of disorder mixed in my heart, I was a little dazed, but—</p>
<p>Not nostalgia!</p>
<p>A few stars are twinkling behind the black curtain of the sky.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow will be a clear day," I thought to myself.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Simplicity and Complexity in Characters <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In order to attract readers, the best way to portray characters in a work is to simplify them.</p>
<p>Simplification means that a hero must be a hero through and through, and a rogue must be a rogue through and through.</p>
<p>But why can such simplified characters attract readers? Perhaps the reason is that our lives are not very complex, and we cannot understand all the actions and thoughts of the complex characters depicted. A typical example is that middle school students generally like to read emotional or sentimental works.</p>
<p>But perhaps there are other reasons.</p>
<p>This fact can be exemplified by the popularity of Jiang Guangchi's novels a few years ago, which specialized in writing about revolutionaries who were revolutionaries through and through. Even now, although this style has changed slightly, when writing about ridiculous characters, they are always depicted with a face smeared with white powder, as if the character has no serious side apart from their ridiculous life; when portraying revolutionaries or patriotic heroes, they always have a cold face, or a sad face, or a flushed face to the end, as if those people live in a vacuum, with no private lives of their own. Works like that are still welcomed to this day.</p>
<p>Of course, our authors also know that the simplification of characters is somewhat unrealistic. Therefore, when portraying characters, they understand the changes in the character's personality. They skillfully match the characters with the environment, turning the character from one extreme to the other, such as turning a non-revolutionary person into a revolutionary in a revolutionary environment, or turning a passive or weak-willed person into an active or strong-willed person under certain circumstances. Thus, the reader is also inspired by the character's transformation and is ultimately captivated by the author.</p>
<p>The truth is that this approach is still another variation of simplification, changing from the simple extreme A to the simple extreme B. It is just a matter of putting two simple characters together. Compared with real characters, the distance is still very far.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the author has no hands-on experience with life. Without hands-on experience with life, relying only on hearsay or cold observation, the author will never understand life.</p>
<p>However, as an author, one has to pretend to understand life. Thus, clever authors, relying on their so-called correct concepts, prop up the characters with a framework, dress them in clothes, slightly sketch their features, and make them act mechanically. But the so-called action is still in the hands of the surrogate, becoming a puppet show.</p>
<p>This is probably the characteristic of formulaic works! And the formation of formulas is probably due to the author's empty life!</p>
<p>But there are also many authors who have indeed had hands-on experience with life. However, in their writing, there is often the suspicion that the characters are too simplified. Although the characters are simple, they are quite vivid, and not mechanically simple. The reason for this is that the author pays too much attention to the reader's taste, and must find a way to arouse the reader's interest with a certain appearance and certain words and deeds; then, from the real characters they are familiar with, they abstract the components they want that match their theme to construct a kind of theatrical character. This is what makes it a novel after all. However, once it relies on the novel and makes the reader not forget that it is a novel when reading it, then its distance from the reality of reality has already been slightly farther. Here, we do not deny the components extracted from real characters in constructing characters; the problem is that to construct a living character, it is necessary to extract various essential or decisive components from various real characters and combine them to make them typical. Typification is definitely not simplification.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the characters written by some authors is due to their obsession with realism. Those who love to write about real-life characters often get bogged down on the surface of the characters, unable to delve into the inner lives of real-life characters. Sometimes, moreover, the author's degree of love or hate for real-life characters in terms of human affairs is used to give them extreme affirmation or extreme denial. The worst result of this tendency is the use of literary works as personal attacks. The reality of reality is veiled by the author's subjective perspective. The author's baseness is exposed, and the attacked characters are obscured and cannot be seen.</p>
<p>The simplicity of characters created by these two creative methods, although not completely divorced from the reality of reality, cannot show the full picture of real characters. The so-called full picture of real characters is not an accurate record of a certain real character, but refers to the typical transcendence of the character.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In real-life characters, generally speaking, the hard-working are relatively simple, and the intellectual class is more complex. But this is only a difference in degree. Simplicity will never be simple through and through, as shown in our past revolutionary literary works, like heroes.</p>
<p>When Gorky wrote about his Malva and Chelkash, they seemed to be relatively simple. But they also have their complexities. Malva's love for the father and son is different, and her love for another rogue is even different. The sensations in her heart are complex, although her whole character is strung together with a simple, promiscuous woman's lines. But it is precisely this way of writing that makes Malva alive.</p>
<p>But when he wrote about Klim Samgin, he described them with complex lines, and in the end, he revealed the simplicity of the life of this character from the intellectual class.</p>
<p>In the third part of the novel The Bystander, Gorky similarly portrays Marina, an extremely complex intellectual woman. She sympathizes with the revolution and sometimes even financially supports the revolution, but she actually enters and exits the doors of the aristocracy, advocating for sectarianism and inheriting other people's property, verbally wanting to replace God with the spirit, but in reality only caring about making money, and using various sensual actions to seduce Klim Samgin, who is her lawyer. This person can truly be said to be extremely complex, but in the end, it cannot be denied that she is also simple. In the work and lives of these two people, apart from sitting and talking about everything, and being concerned with material desires, there is never anything else to do. Marina criticizes Klim Samgin, saying:</p>
<p>"You intellectuals are accustomed to using many questions to decorate yourselves and show off to others. You flaunt complexity, as if saying, 'See who is more complex?' And you are just making each other entangled. Because the solution to the problem does not come from reason, but from will... Reason is just helping from the side. Only the will can teach people how to walk freely."</p>
<p>These words are extremely correct. But Marina herself is also extremely mysteriously complex. Here, we only hear the correctness of all Marina's statements, but her actions make people feel mysterious. She advocates sectarianism and opposes Christianity; and she sympathizes with the revolution and provides assistance to revolutionaries. She wants to improve Klim Samgin's spirit, which seems to be dominated by laziness, and finally uses the fiery belief—spiritual belief—to seduce him, but instead scares him away, and he finally leaves Marina. This is truly an extremely complex, detailed depiction, and readers who do not have patience will find it difficult to finish the whole story.</p>
<p>The characters dealt with in Chinese works can be said to be mostly intellectuals. But the intellectuals we see in the works are so simple that they only make people love or hate; perhaps Chinese intellectuals are relatively simple. But they also have their sorrows and joys, anger and calmness, timidity and determination, their conscience towards the group and private desires, and their sense of justice and ideas of rights—why does no one express these mutually contradictory and conflicting personalities? The characters in our writers' works really demand too much simplification.</p>
<p>But we are still waiting. Waiting for the appearance of complex characters who depict the complexity of an era. Although this is relatively unpopular with readers, the complex era will advance the reader's understanding!</p>
<h3 id="e198">Ah Hua's Death <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Shi</p>
<p>It was actually this spring, but she—Ah Hua—her impression on me has burned into my heart, thinking about it now, it is as clear as if it happened this morning.</p>
<p>The matter is like this: My landlord, Mrs. Lü, in order to squeeze two pounds of beef juice for her two chubby sons every day, had a lot of beef residue left over that had no taste at all. It would be a pity to just throw it in the trash can, and it wouldn't be appropriate to give it to beggars, so she asked her son-in-law—the fourth aunt's husband—for a female cat. Naturally, on the one hand, it was to catch mice, and on the other hand, it was simply to use it as a digestion machine for the beef residue. This finally solved the serious problem that Mrs. Lü had been thinking about for a long time. Mrs. Lü gave this cat a very appropriate name: Ah Hua, because its whole body was a jumble of yellow, white, and black.</p>
<p>I didn't like Ah Hua very much, it wasn't all white, nor all black, which didn't fit my prejudice about cats. Needless to say, this had nothing to do with it, it wasn't mine, I didn't have the responsibility to raise it, only Mrs. Lü never forgot to teach the maid to give it beef residue to eat every day. Before long, it became fat.</p>
<p>Spring quietly came to the world and quietly left. At that time, Ah Hua had been calling in front and behind the house for several nights, but later it stopped calling. But I unintentionally discovered that Ah Hua was even fatter and its belly was getting bigger, I knew it was about to become a mother. At the same time, I also found a male cat following it around, which made me curious. I asked my wife, and she told me that it was Ah Hua's husband, who had been recruited a month ago. Oh! I laughed in realization, my wife also laughed, but Mrs. Lü's consideration was very different from ours. She deeply hated this foreign cat, which had to share half of Ah Hua's beef residue, and felt it was too inappropriate, so she often chased the male cat with a wooden stick, drove it out of the door, and didn't allow it to come in again. But after a while, Ah Hua and it could be found hiding under the kitchen table, meowing. It was really too easy for it to sneak in through the window or under the iron door.</p>
<p>One night, it was during the Qingming Festival, and the drizzle outside the window was very bleak. Everyone in the house was asleep, only I was still bent over my desk, groping in the light of an old lamp. A cat was calling, its intermittent cries filling the front and back, up and down, terribly. I could tell that it was Ah Hua, its voice was too familiar to me. But why was it crying? Who had hurt it? It made me think of a wife who had lost her husband, a mother who had lost her son, this tragic cry of the world, piercing my still heart, and at the same time making me unbearable. I went to chase and beat Ah Hua in anger, regardless of whether this action was cruel; but when I got close to it, it quickly ran away. However, it was still meowing, obviously my threat could not stop its sorrow. In this way, I was disturbed by it and could not get a moment of peace of mind, so I had to stop my work and angrily wake up my wife who had already fallen asleep. My wife told me that Mrs. Lü had told the coachman, Ah Er, to drive the male cat several streets away, so that it wouldn't recognize its way back to guard its wife who was about to give birth, which was why Ah Hua was crying; so my heart turned cold.</p>
<p>Ah Hua cried all night, and cried again the next day, but its husband didn't hear its voice, and from then on it lived alone for a long time, until it gave birth.</p>
<p>Ah Hua gave birth to two kittens, I don't remember exactly when, but according to my wife, one of them was born lame, and I didn't care much about it. As for why she told me this, there was also a reason: it turned out that Ah Hua had jumped onto my family's cupboard and smashed all the bowls inside, making my wife so angry that her face turned pale. I said:</p>
<p>"Ah Hua must be hungry, so it stole to eat."</p>
<p>"That's right," my wife replied, "Mrs. Lü's children don't eat beef juice anymore, and Ah Hua doesn't have beef residue to eat, and they don't even give it enough to eat with stinky fish and rice, and it has to feed the kittens with milk, how can it not be greedy?"</p>
<p>"Are the kittens fun? Are they all white?"</p>
<p>"Fun? One of them was born lame and can't even walk."</p>
<p>I don't know if Mrs. Lü hated it because it gave birth to a lame son? Or was there another reason? One night I found Ah Hua catching goldfish in the fish tank in front of my window to eat, I proved that it was really starving. Sure enough, the next day Mrs. Lü found that the fish tank was missing a "dragon seed" and gave Ah Hua a good beating.</p>
<p>It is of course an extremely ordinary thing for a cat to be beaten for stealing food, but sometimes it can make you realize the sadness of life from an animal. For its own hunger, and for the hunger of its children, is it the greatest sin to be forced to steal? Because of this, I was also melancholy for a while, but before long I forgot about it again.</p>
<p>"Dad, come and see, little Ah Mi is jumping in the kitchen!"</p>
<p>One morning, my four-year-old child happily told me this, and immediately dragged me to the kitchen. Sure enough, one of the two kittens was clumsily snatching the paper ball tied with a thread in the maid's hand, Ah Hua was watching from the side, and the other lame one was not moving at all, only occasionally making a weak cry. Ah Hua saw the child's jumping and naturally had infinite joy, but when the lame one could not move, it just stared at it with sadness. It used its front paw to nudge it, meaning to tell it to stand up, and then jumped around itself to teach it, but the lame child just meowed and didn't move at all. Once, twice, three times, Ah Hua was exhausted and had to sit aside, watching it motionless, and even the jumping of the other child didn't arouse its interest. After a while, it lowered its tail and quietly walked away. But who can understand the sadness of a mother? The children were still laughing happily, the kittens were still jumping, the maid was still teasing them, and Mrs. Lü was still smiling happily. The terrible thing finally happened on the first day. Ah Hua took one of the children and hid upstairs, refusing to come down no matter what, not eating or crying, so the maid had to send stinky fish and rice upstairs. My wife told me that Ah Hua had bitten the lame child to death in the kitchen!</p>
<p>"Ah? When did that happen?" I couldn't help but be greatly surprised.</p>
<p>"Probably last night." My wife's trembling voice was obviously moved. Then she said, "It's really a strange thing, there would be such a cat in the world! But do you think this is hate or love?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer her, I just felt that Ah Hua's behavior was too terrifying. For a long time I didn't dare to forget it, I even didn't want to see Ah Hua walk past me. I simply felt that human wisdom and emotions were not necessarily comparable to Ah Hua's level.</p>
<p>It was another deep night, and the humidity of the plum rain season, even if the quiet windows were tightly closed, would make you feel that the thick fog of rain would suffocate you to death. I could hardly bear my mood to write an article, and what's more, I heard Ah Hua crying woo-woo. I could hear that this cry contained a kind of love and anxiety, as if a mother had accidentally lost her son and had to call him back immediately. Sure enough, I listened carefully and quietly, and there was still little Ah Mi's voice outside the door, trembling in the fog of rain. So I quickly opened the door, hugged it in, and let it snuggle in its mother's arms, Ah Hua snuggling against its wet fur. After a while, I rushed them back to the kitchen, little Ah Mi hobbling and jumping behind its mother. It turned out that this one that hadn't died had been trampled and injured by Mrs. Lü. But I hope this injury will be better soon. The next day I didn't forget to tell the maid, "Be careful again, don't let Ah Hua bite it to death again."</p>
<p>After that, summer quickly passed, and little Ah Mi grew up, but there was still the original wound on its leg, and it would inevitably be disabled for life, but who would take the affairs of animals to heart?</p>
<p>Occasionally I asked my wife, and she said that Ah Hua had been much kinder recently, and I secretly rejoiced that little Ah Mi was very lucky; although it was disabled, wasn't it more important to be able to stay in the world? At the same time, I also thought this: if I were a veterinarian, I would use splints to tie up and correct its leg, give it more fish and meat to eat, and make it stronger, and maybe it would get better, too.</p>
<p>In the hot weather, people all hid in their houses, not daring to go out, only Ah Hua, but I saw it sunbathing in the courtyard several times. At first I was surprised, but later I found it was thin, and I knew it was sick. The day before yesterday, everyone smelled a stench in the courtyard, and Ah Er looked around and found Ah Hua's decaying corpse in the corner near the fish tank, it had died quietly! Who would have expected it?</p>

<p>Informal Discussions</p>
<h3 id="e200">After Reading Song Zheyuan's Letter to Fellow Compatriots in Hebei and Chahar <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>I was very surprised to suddenly see Song Zheyuan's letter to fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar in the newspaper the other day. Before I saw Mr. Song's letter to fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar, I was confused and did not carefully consider the difficulty of Mr. Song's situation, and whether his response to the environment was appropriate. But after seeing Mr. Song's letter to fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar, I was even more surprised and suspicious.</p>
<p>I don't know what Mr. Song means by publishing his letter to fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar? Is it because the fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar cannot forgive Mr. Song's current attitude and have doubts, so Mr. Song published such a letter to clarify his aspirations? Or is it that the fellow compatriots outside Hebei and Chahar are dissatisfied with Mr. Song's conduct and measures, so Mr. Song's letter to fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar is also to inform the fellow compatriots outside Hebei and Chahar, so that Mr. Song's attitude and ambitions can be known to the world and future generations? Or is it that Mr. Song, after being busy with paperwork, suddenly had a blow and unease in his conscience, and also had some apologies, so he published such a letter to explain himself? Therefore, before Mr. Song did not inform his fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar, it was fine, but once he informed them, it made his fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar, and those who were not from Hebei and Chahar, even more confused and inexplicable.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's position in North China is indeed difficult, which is well known and can be forgiven, because if Mr. Song assumes to have some advocacy, then before Mr. Song has any advocacy in our country, how can we blame Mr. Song for not being able to make the people of the country understand and forgive him? Therefore, because of Mr. Song's letter, I thought of a letter that Dr. Hu once wrote to Mr. Song. In his letter, he put forward five key points:</p>
<p>First, I hope that Mr. Song Zheyuan will thoroughly understand his own position. Second, I hope that Mr. Song Zheyuan understands that all enemies of the Republic of China are his enemies. Third, I hope that Mr. Song Zheyuan will use clear language to express his attitude to our friendly "neighboring country". Fourth, I hope that Mr. Song Zheyuan will thoroughly understand that his power is the power that stands on the national position.</p>
<p>The last point said that the national position is a whole, not a branch, and all acts of compromise and reconciliation, no matter how forgivable the intention, their traces are all destroying the unity of the country, and the people of the whole country will never forgive them. This letter was published in the 204th issue of Independent Review, and the publishing agency of the newspaper was in Beiping. I believe Mr. Song has already read this article. Now, Mr. Song's so-called equality and mutual benefit in foreign relations, seeking beneficial cooperation between the two sides, and never doing anything to betray the people's power and humiliate the country, judging from the current situation in North China, I don't know where this statement of yours comes from, so the more Mr. Song Zheyuan informs his fellow compatriots in Hebei and Chahar, the more doubts his fellow compatriots have.</p>

<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>The tide has receded towards the east. The Qiantang River—looks like a flat porcelain basin. The seawater on the river surface is tinged with yellow, as if someone had stirred it up. The green hills and sandy beaches on the opposite bank are shrouded in a hazy mist, looking from afar like they are covered with layers of transparent, light gauze.</p>
<p>Most of the boats sailed towards the south of the Yangtze River last night when the tide rose; now, only a few sharp-tailed sand-panning boats remain, scattered on the river, swiftly sailing like shooting stars in the summer night. ———</p>
<p>They sailed to the seawall of Wangjia Gaobao, and the time was just noon. Old Man Xiaogen's boat was the first to dock.</p>
<p>Old Man Xiaogen—extended a head from the stern of the cabin, with silvery white hair and bristly whiskers: fluttering in the wind. His face looked like a dried walnut, with more than ten deep wrinkles, and a high nose bridge, bulging between two bright eyes. He squinted his eyes and looked around the river:</p>
<p>———Xiaogen! Where are they going? Do you see Uncle Jiu's boat?</p>
<p>He then pointed to the boats on the waterway ahead.</p>
<p>———Uncle Jiu and the others are probably going to the Qilitang area. They are really enthusiastic, going to find "live cargo" (like fish and shrimp) there again!</p>
<p>———Xiaogen! "Live cargo" is valuable, should we go too?</p>
<p>———Don't go! I think we should just start digging sand here. Going there would be at least five or six li away, I'm afraid you can't handle that much distance!</p>
<p>Xiaogen said earnestly with a serious black face.</p>
<p>———Oh———the old man sighed, looking back at Xiaogen: a son with a strong body and muscles like a bull had long satisfied him. Why should he still be envious of others? Let them go find "live cargo".</p>
<p>Thinking like this, he grunted and climbed into the cabin to take out bamboo baskets and iron shovels for Xiaogen. Xiaogen, with his upper body bare, looked like a fat frog, ready to jump into the water.</p>
<p>———Xiaogen! You have to be careful! Your father is old, you must pay attention to quicksand.</p>
<p>———Dad, don't worry!</p>
<p>This is a wide river surface. It is more than thirty zhang away from the shore. Panning for sand would be too deep! There is no water with anything to pan for, not to mention "live cargo," which is scarce here. Then, the father and son need to plan.</p>
<p>———Xiaogen! Let's get closer!</p>
<p>———This is the firewood pier (a fort to prevent the dike from collapsing) of Wangjiabao! Doesn't the Dike Works Bureau have an order that "all boats, large and small, are not allowed to dock"? Dad! We are not allowed to dock here!</p>
<p>———Then!… You, you…</p>
<p>While they were discussing, from afar, on the dike, two policemen guarding the dike glared fiercely at them.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>——Hey! Young man! Come closer,—one of them, like a hedgehog, spoke first:—Damn it! I finally caught you today! You two are stealing dike firewood. Come closer! Let ten minutes be enough for you to take our blame!</p>
<p>Another one, with a broken, hoarse voice, spoke, and immediately took the foreign rifle from his shoulder and placed it in his right hand.</p>
<p>——Officer Sir! We are sand-panning boatmen, we are innocent! Please…</p>
<p>Old Man Xiaogen collapsed on the cabin floor, using all his strength to make his face turn red, and squeezed out some words from between his teeth to answer.</p>
<p>——Still trying to deny it? Go fool someone else, I won't be deceived by you!</p>
<p>"What can we do"?!</p>
<p>The boat came closer, and the child Xiaogen was finally taken away amidst the noisy struggle and Old Man Xiaogen's tears, in exchange for two kicks and a few slaps, considering his old age, he was let go.</p>
<p>The next day, people along the river spread the word: "Xiaogen, who pans for sand, committed some crime yesterday at Wangjia Gaobao and was arrested by the dike police and sentenced to two years of imprisonment"?!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Mistake <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>The wife waved her hand and said softly, "Go, I'm fine..."</p>
<p>The husband and I hurriedly left the small two-story house.</p>
<p>It was already autumn, and the streets seemed unusually quiet. Withered yellow plane tree leaves flew in the cold night wind.</p>
<p>I became very gloomy, and even now I can still hear the faint, slightly choked voice in my ears, the voice coming from the mouth of a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old woman with tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Three months ago, she still had a very strong body, two big, round, black eyes, and spoke in a loud voice with a slightly masculine tone. But now everything has changed, she has become thin and haggard...</p>
<p>In the factory, she was a beautiful flower, with about twelve or thirteen young male workers chasing after her at the same time. Now, her husband is one of them. He has an honest and handsome face, and a body as strong as a young bull, a promising young worker. He and she are from the same hometown, and they are the same age, so he has an advantage in the group of people who coveted this little flower.</p>
<p>One day, I didn't go to work. In the evening, he came to knock on the door of our cubicle. When I came out to open the door for him, I couldn't help but be shocked by his disheveled appearance. His face was bruised and swollen, blood was flowing from his lips, and one hand was wrapped in a handkerchief; however, he was still smiling happily, with an excited and resolute look on his face.</p>
<p>"I...I fought with that bunch of bastards..." he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>I stared at him worriedly for a moment: "Why? Because of jealousy?..."</p>
<p>He looked seriously around the room, as if he didn't hear what I said, and then silently continued:</p>
<p>"Because they all bullied her. One said, 'Aying, let's open a hotel,' and made obscene gestures; another simply thickened his skin and reached out to touch her breasts. I got angry at the time and fought with three of them."</p>
<p>"You fool, everyone is working well in the factory, why hurt everyone's feelings for a woman?..." I said a little displeasedly in a reproachful tone.</p>
<p>"You, you don't understand..." he opened his eyes wide, looking at me as if he were angry, and then silently opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>In the factory, whenever we went to work or got off work, we occasionally had the opportunity to meet, but mostly we just glanced at each other silently, or waved our hands, and then walked away as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>However, one day he came to our house with Aying, both of them very excited, their faces flushed. As soon as he entered the door, he laughed loudly and said:</p>
<p>"Guess, Rongsheng, why are we here?..."</p>
<p>She stood shyly next to the table, smiling, which made her even more charming. It was here that I began to understand how this young man was so infatuated with her. I looked at them, and although I guessed six or seven points in my heart, I still pretended to be stupid and said in an incomprehensible tone:</p>
<p>"Can't guess, is there night work tonight?..."</p>
<p>They laughed heartily when they heard this, laughing so loudly that they couldn't catch their breath. Finally, they slowly restrained their smiles and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"We are here to invite you to our wedding feast. We have been living together since yesterday..."</p>
<p>I was a little worried for them. They were young, and their monthly income was so small. They just lived together because of a temporary emotional impulse. If something unexpected happened, they would be in great danger; however, I didn't say it. I just silently expressed my comfort for their happy life.</p>
<p>After that, they lived according to their own wishes, full of excitement and happiness. However, soon Yin Ni occupied their hearts, and she coughed and stopped doing business. This sudden change was too strange for them. Her condition had new changes. She went to the Red Cross Hospital, and the doctor told them it was tuberculosis. He became depressed and desperate, and often came to me with tears in his eyes:</p>
<p>"You, Rongsheng, help me think of a way, she is about to despair..."</p>
<p>I was very sad. Although I couldn't help him much, I promised to think of a way for him. Now, we are stepping on the streets of September dusk, heading towards a journey of hope.</p>
<p>"You are young and emotional, and you don't take a step back to think..."</p>
<p>He hurriedly interrupted my words painfully, and called out in a sad tone:</p>
<p>"I...I did wrong..."</p>
<p>I looked and his eyes were red with anger.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Child <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Xiu Yang</p>
<p>——Starting with "Debt Collection"</p>
<p>The child died three minutes after being born. They say that is "landing pass" from the moment a person is born to the moment they die, they have to go through many "passes", so wealthy families specially made gold "pass clearance" ornaments for their children to be attached to their hats, saying that this can "turn bad luck into good fortune". But what about the "landing pass" where they die as soon as they are born? They only say that they came to "collect debts", and there is no way to save them.</p>
<p>I already have a six-year-old child who has already entered school. The child is very smart and lovely. In lonely times, he is often my teacher, because his questions and actions evoke my childhood memories: he is also my shadow, and he accepts my stubborn personality. I don't spoil this child like ordinary parents, maybe it can be said that I love him more than ordinary. I warn him not to learn all bad habits, instill in him the things that children should do, but not deprive him of his innocence—this is a lesson I learned from watching Shirley Temple's films. This child, who has earned countless benefits for Hollywood businessmen, now, his innocence has been almost completely deprived, he is just a money-making "machine" like other "cash cows". Although the audience welcomes her "matter-of-fact" non-child actions, this is undoubtedly a cruel punishment! Children should be allowed to act willfully, just as Mao Dun said in "Fun Children" "philanthropist" (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e208">Nanjing Grand Theater Presents "The Great Ziegfeld" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Everyone who has seen the film The Great Ziegfeld unanimously believes that this film is a great masterpiece that has never been seen in the film industry since its inception. Only the head of Hollywood Pictures, MGM, has such courage and talent to make such a great attempt. William Powell, Myrna Loy, and Luise Rainer play the most important roles in the film, which is already a choice of the times. The greatness of the singing and dancing scenes can be called the artistic crystallization of the company's technical staff. The revolving stage and the flying stage are truly unprecedented spectacles. The costumes worn by the dancers in the film are novel in style and dazzling, and everywhere they adhere to the principle of "beauty". Ziegfeld was originally the leader of the Broadway singing and dancing world. He had a lot of good materials under his command. Eddie Cantor, a famous comedian in the film industry, and the late master of humor, Will Rogers, were his discoveries. His slogan is to "Glorify the America Girls", meaning to use the inherent physical beauty of American girls, with the beauty of pearls and jade, and the beauty of soft colors and melodious tunes, to create a new era in the singing and dancing world. Therefore, the show was watched by thousands of people as soon as it was staged. Now MGM has presented his commendable and moving deeds and all the singing and dancing creations he had painstakingly managed in his life to the audience at sea. It is now being screened at the Nanjing Grand Theater in this city. Film lovers in Shanghai should not miss this once-in-a-century opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e209">"The Great Ziegfeld" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<h3 id="e210">"Night Meeting" Accomplishes German Virtue <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Writing the Cruel Phase of the Gold-Drenched Night Market with the Lightest and Most Beautiful Style</p>
<p>After the July 1st innovation, the Star Company's film production line has obviously progressed to the most active direction. "Night Meeting" has restored the "women's rights" and accomplished German virtue. After this film, one of the Star's Second Factory "Qingming Season" (directed by Ouyang Yuqian, starring Li Minghui and Zhao Dan, written by Yao Sinnong) and "Life and Death Together" (directed by Ying Yunwei, starring Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er, written by Yang Hansheng), and the First Factory's "Eternal Smile" (directed by Wu Cun, starring Hu Die and Zhao Dan, written by Liu Naou) will also be completed one after another. Star also has the completed "Xiao Lingzi" (directed by Cheng Bugao, starring Tan Ying and Zhao Dan, written by Ouyang Yuqian), which is waiting to be released. The gray twilight color of the Chinese film industry in the past has now changed to a lively and thriving state.</p>
<p>"Night Meeting" was written by Yao Sufeng. The famous director Li Pingqian continued the masterpiece of "Peach and Plum Contending", using the lightest and most beautiful style to express the tragic state of the glittering and brilliant night Shanghai. The leading actors are Gu Lanjun, Gong Jianong, Huang Naishuang, Xie Jun, etc. Shi Fu made a cameo appearance. Gong Jianong played a blind man, deeply moving. Gu Lanjun's enthusiasm and loveliness, and Huang Naishuang's sorrowful and beautiful posture are all enough to touch the hearts of the audience. The newcomer Xie Jun played a beautiful and cruel teenager, and Li Pingqian personally regarded him as very satisfied. The release date of this film should also be in the near future.</p>
